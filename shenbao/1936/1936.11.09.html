<p>寗夏通訊</p>
<h3>寗夏剪影</h3>
<p>— 徐弋吾</p>
<p>農民的困苦</p>
<p>我最近在寗夏各縣作了兩星期的旅行。所得到的最深刻的印象就是農民的困苦。一般的農民簡直是「家無隔宿之糧」的。這原因，並不是在寗夏只有九個縣治，連同一個空立衙門的磴口縣，（磴口縣土地權為阿拉善旗所有，從前是一個設治局），從而財政人不敷出，不得不加征田賦，也不是在寗夏可耕地，不過佔全面積白分之十，生產不够消費。寗夏財政每年實足有七百萬元的收入，决不致不敷全省的軍政費的歲出，寗夏土地，以得黃河水利，素稱肥沃，也不該使農民窮到如此。我想個中原因，只有寗　當道知得最淸楚吧。</p>
<p>要說明寗夏農民的困苦，可以舉我所親見一件事來做個例子。有一天。我到王洪堡（離寗垣七十里，屬寗朔縣）途遇一個農民，自縣政府慟哭而歸。叩以故，其人吞泣啞然曰：「活不成呵！這年頭，老百姓活不成呵！」餘語不復成聲。經詳詢後，始知該人王姓，住本縣第四區，種地十畝，應繳田糧二十五元，（每畝田糧折價二元五角）附捐九角，壯丁費一元，水利捐一元五角，烟畝罰欵（不種鴉片也得罰欵）八十元，合計—畝之地，每年負担官稅一百十一元，平均每畝年捐十一元，如年成豐收，種麥可穫八石，約値九十六元，勉可應付。如種罌粟，可收六百兩，約値一百五十元，足可支應官稅，不幸寗朔縣第四區各鄉，本年八月廿四日下了一次冰雹，秋麥經此打擊，收成無望，今年烟苗又不好，一畝地只收二十多兩，七月間收下來，早被政府按一元六兩（巿價每元四兩）收去抵稅了。家中已無顆粒，老少五口，嗷嗷待哺。（此等被災地區，縣府本應呈報省府，豁免秋糧，）而政府竟因他滯納秋糧，將他拘押，用刑逼欵。這幕悲劇是記者偶爾遇合，其他各縣類似這樣的苛政，道塗傳聞，已是司空見慣的了。現在各縣逃戶的數目，據記者所知道的，平羅七百餘戶，金積二百五十戶，中衛四百餘戶。（其他各縣未祥）逃戶以平羅居多，而財廳各縣收入比較，也以平羅成統為佳。上年九月間寗朔縣長牟鳳鳴，因為不忍苛待老百姓，催征不力，受上峯譴責。同時應繳財廳比較稅欵，相差過多，他老人家（五十二歲了）上交不了賬，下可憐老百姓的窮苦，不得已跳入黃河自殺；一命嗚呼！後來馬主席給他開了一個追悼會，給家屬二千元恤金，也算是聊慰忠魂的辦法。</p>
<p>我經過寗夏不少的農村，每踏進一戶農家，主人出迎，讓座遷茶（上戶人家纔飲得起茶，普遍都是喝冷水，坐處都是土坑）之後，第一聲總是「啊」！或者「唉」！繼以訴苦，終而憂容滿面，一若着長衫制服者，一進門來，便非吉兆。至於屋裏「坑無蓆，婦孺衣不蔽體，</p>
<p>更不消說了。農民大都每天只能够吃兩頓麵糊（以靑菜嫩草調麵粉煮成稀薄的漿糊質的食品），而挨縣吏官役的馬棒，（騎馬騾所用的木鞭，長二尺，圓徑約一寸五分，役吏常以此拷打老百姓，他們有句俗語：寗夏的老百姓，百句好話不如一頓馬棒，」役吏猖在，於此可見）在農民是常有的事。諺云：「天下黃河富寗夏，如今却成這個樣子，豈是我們始料所及？</p>
<p>寗夏與阿拉善旗的關係</p>
<p>寗夏全省面積的九一一·六一二方里，在賀蘭山以北，蒙古高原的邊緣，皆係阿拉善旗轄地，的佔全面積百分之三十許。其西額濟納旗亦佔全面積百分之二十許，（其地多係砂磧草地，以鹽池出產及往來駝捐，草頭稅等為唯一收入。自包頭到甘新商路，均經阿旗，故該旅每年草頭稅收入，的有二百萬元之數）·可耕地僅佔全面積百分之五光景。阿拉善旗一名西套草地，首鎭曰定遠營，今設紫湖設治局，王府在賀蘭山西麓，阿旗親王達里札雅駐此，為西蒙唯一的商業區。達王世襲札薩克之職，與前淸內宮有姻誼，本人常駐北平，遙理旗務，對東蒙察哈爾八旗·綏蒙烏蘭察布·伊克昭盟，素少聯絡，民二十一年寗夏省府改組，達王就任省府委員，曾數度來寗，出席省務會議，對於阿旗敎育建設諸政的推進，屢有商議。二十二年省府在磴口縣城北一百二十里白衣碼坎阿旗地，設稅卡截收東路駝路稅欵，改磴口設治局為縣，並對阿旗蒙鹽過境課以重稅，遂引起達王之反感，雙方據　互爭，雖經中央主管機關綢處，終未得具體解决。</p>
<p>磴口全縣漢人不過二千餘戶，入阿拉善旗蒙籍的，倒有八百五十戶之多。為什麽漢人反而要入籍呢？這裏有兩個原因（一）漢人入蒙籍種旗地，每年只拿些草頭稅卽可得到優裕的生活。（二）漢人的種地，必須經縣府淸丈登記升課，方許耕種，而且每年要給縣府拿無限制的捐賦。磴口縣境十數年前都是一片荒地，一般沒有土地的或是逃荒的農民，他們拿汗血去墾殖它，纔得到現在苦盡甜來的生活。漸事生荒變熟地的利益。縣政府硬給它升課抽稅，怎使他們甘願？可是沒有力量的老白姓，怎能過其無政府的牛活狀態呢？於是大都就近加人蒙　，其目的不外避免縣府派給的重累負担，別求自力生存之道罷了。可是磴口縣是設立了，一個縣府沒有老百姓，怎能成其為政府？於是强迫農民登記，希冀完成建縣的目的。但是另一方面，阿拉善旗的達王，也不願將八百餘戶現成納草頭稅的農戶讓給磴口縣府。况且根據中國與圖界綫，阿拉善旗的轄地磴口縣境大部份也在其內。這筆賬直到現在這是算不淸。上年蒙藏會派唐柯三氏調解，也不過就雙方情感上謀融洽，對於磴口縣劃界事件的本身，終究未聞有何具體解决的辦法。</p>
<p>寗夏省垣到阿旗達王府現有汽車路可通，大約六小時可以到達。阿拉善旗，其斯處地位，甚關重要。據最近消息，日方在阿拉善旗境內建築飛行庫，並派大批浪人，分逮擾亂隴西甘（張掖）凉（平番）一帶，」如水銀瀉地，無孔不入。其用意何在？明眼人當可洞悉。吾人深信寗夏當局必能秉其平素信心，鞏固防共陣綫，謝絕某方在寗活動，惟寗省對阿旗，情感欠洽，一時聯絡禦侮，頗為不易，倘阿旗不幸，淪為某方騷擾西北之策源地，寗省首常其衝，將不勝其麻煩矣。</p>
<p>北平特信</p>
<h3>平文化界悼念魯迅</h3>
<p>我國文壇巨子思想先鋒魯迅之逝世消息，自上月十九日，由滬上傳至此間後，當晚，此間各晚報，卽以三號字標題，於第一版之最顯著地位，加以揭載。戰與不識，無不同聲悲悼。溯彼之生平，民國元年以後，至民國十五年以前，止息於故都者，凡十有五年。而震動一時之吶喊與彷徨，短篇小說集，亦悉於此時期內產生。在思想方面，彼會與當時風靡一時之故都「正人君子」派，互相搏鬥。並因而開罪當道，遭通緝逃至廣東。自—五年迄今，此十年內，彼之足跡，雖全在南方，但其一言一行，此間文化界人士，以及靑年學生，對之莫不予以極深注意。觀於民國二十一年冬，彼為探省其太夫人重旅故都時，靑年學生歡迎之熱烈，其在故都人士心目中，印象究為如何，巳可概見。去年「一二九」「一二一六」兩次示威游行後，學生運動，蓬勃一時，茲十個月以來，「救亡路綫」「新文字運動」「國防文學」等問題，為靑年義論之焦點。而氏對於「聯合戰綫」「國防文學」等問題所發表之議論，尤為此間靑年學生注意之對象；於討論時，每每加以稱引。人望之重，罕有比倫。雖載彼言論之刋物，往往因環境關係，在此間不能發賣。但千方　計，輾轉設法購得者，亦比比皆是。觀以上種種，足徵氏與故都文化界關係之深。</p>
<p>氏之逝世消息，初傳至此間時，各方面，均為感情所激動，表現之反應，極不一致。悲痛者有之，哀傷者有之。對氏之生平，讚揚者有之，悼惜者有之。正因表演各有不同，此不同之各方面間，往往又互生誤會，趨其極，乃彼此詆誹。其實，在根本上並無二致，故事過兩週，上述之紛歧，巳鍵漸减少。感情之激動，巳漸為理智所代替。對氏之生平，各方已有一致之態度者。約有下列數點。</p>
<p>（一）實容與怨恨—氏之生前，因思想立塲關係，往往不惜以激烈筆調，加人以最刻毒之批判。而受之者，常常又係其親近成好友。其實，氏之做人處世，固於冷崚中含有莫大熱烈。凡與氏交往者，類能言之。至於思想上之批判，與私人之交誼，固毫不相涉也。外間不察，以為凡曾受氏之批判者，大率對之抱有反感，北平方面，曾與氏發生言論爭執之人士，允屬衆多。是以，初聞魯迅逝世時，此班人士之態度，為一般人注意之對象。惟二週以來，此班人士，巳先後表示意見，其一致之點，均為悲悼與痛惜。對於與氏生前彼此閒之交誼，均甚為重視。雖氏於逝世前，預擬遺囑中，有「損着別人的牙眼却反對報復，主張寬容的人，萬不可和他接近」一條。似據記者執此以詢其生前友好之結果，其答謂，「此係就一般立論，吾與魯迅有近二十年之交誼，深知其平素做人，並不如此嚴峻。」</p>
<p>（二）「轉變」問題——魯迅於民國十六年後之二三年內，曾因創作態度問題，與當時屬於前進份子之創造社，太陽社等人物，從事筆戰。其後民國十八年左右，氏之態度變更，左翼作家大同盟成立，前進文人，紛紛加入。宣言發表時，署名其首者，赫然為魯迅氏。此後，卽一貫以社會主義思想立塲，發表言論，文壇上謂氏此時期態度之變更，為轉變。意謂山人道主義立塲，轉向社會主義立塲也。目前蓋棺論定，對於此點，為此間一般人士最注意之處，各方面發表之言論，亦以屬於此方面者為最多，截至目下為止，雖總結論之期，尙未達到：但觀察一般趨勢，認氏民十八之態度變更，仍為一貫前進者，巳佔有優勢。蓋凡此間熟知氏之生平者，無不謂其向來創作態度，均為一貫立塲：不過因環境不同，而變其方式而己。根本上為前進，為一貫，並非轉變也。氏生前友好，北大　國文系文任馬裕藻氏，曾對此點，一再强調主張，而於一班企借此「轉變俗說法，以達私人目的之人，尤致以無限之憤慨。</p>
<p>（三）魯迅與高爾基——氏逝世後，及於中國之損失，一般均以蘇俄文壇本年高爾某逝世之損失比驚之。惟故都文化界人士，大多以為魯迅目前逝世，中國文壇損失，較蘇俄目前失一高爾基為允大。其理由以為：（一）蘇俄光明社會，已吿實現，與黑暗搏鬥之文學家，已不若謳歌光明社會者之重要，此在中國，則絕不相同。（二）高爾基雖已逝去，　後進文學家，正如雨後春筍文壇重心，不　失去，中國失一魯迅，文壇重心，頓有搖動之象。故其損失，可謂異常重人。（三）高爾基為純粹文學家，對於思想方面，有所憑，藉中國目前，則為紛亂之社會，氏以一身，兼文學家與思想家雙重責任，其逝世後，不獨在文學上靑年失去範本，卽在思想上，亦失去重要導師。總結各方面意見，上述三點，似已一致公認。</p>
<p>（三）乃弟周作人氏之態度——由於個性不同，在魯迅生前，對彼等兄弟間之情　，卽有種種不和之傳說。魯迅逝世後，此間首接消息者，亦為周作人所接彼等三弟周建人拍來之電報，直至報紙方面公佈其消息於社會後，周作人之態度如何，雖屬彼等家庭內事件，但因彼等同為文學家之故，社會人士對之，亦極為注意。其後，周作人因太夫人需人奉養，無　南去，於是外間之猜測，乃更為之紛紛。直至北大舉行魯迅追悼會中，彼始有詳細叙述彼等兄弟間關係之機會。此後，社會上亦方有一淸楚之認識。大概彼等思想上與文學上之主張，極不相同；但彼等情感，固亦絕不如外間所傳也。前者觀於周作人在追悼會中，曾一再聲明，對於民十五後魯迅之思想，不甚明瞭，以及盛稱魯迅關於考古學，史學方面之著述，而於其小說雜感等著述，則略而不提，等等，可以知之。後者，觀於其在追悼會中之沉痛情形，亦可知之。但總結其態度，似乎共本人在追悼會中之答詞，可以總括一切。其大意謂：「居於家屬地位，略一讚揚，將為人冷笑；加以抑制，又易招人反感，故甚困難，」云云。</p>
<p>截至目下為止，此間各報紙已先後出有追悼專頁。各學校亦先後舉行追悼大會，聞最近將由各文藝團體，聯合舉行一大規模之追悼會。至於魯迅全集，聞亦已由此間其友好在着手編輯中。周作人曾語人云：如編全集需要魯迅生平事蹟時，彼與其介弟周建人，當盡量供給資料也。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>如何安定物價</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>年來物價上升。有增靡已。一般經營工商業者。莫不色喜。而各地糧產豐收。農民似亦稍蘇。但一觀各省之禁糧出境。則可知糧食雖稱豐收。仍木足以應地方之需求。一觀上海粉麥紗花升降波輻之巨大。則所謂物價上漲。又適見其為不安定之現象耳。據近日所聞。因物價上漲而求增加工資者有之。因工資糾紛而起爭毆者有之。此種事態雖小。然苟不早謀適當之補救。則未來之隱患。亦滋可慮也。</p>
<p>吾人以為物價與幣値。互為因果。在現行幣制下。不可無一尺度。以資比較。此尺度之覓得。當求之於一地物價指數。工商界之種種糾紛。當循此尺度。以謀解决。而物價縱不能全無變動。要亦可循此尺度以减少其投機操縱等擾亂之因素。使其升降不失為正則化也。</p>
<p>現在物價之變化。或受時局之影響。或為謠言所支配。投機操縱大抵由此而生。但時局之影響甚暫。而謠言之發生無窮。近日市塲之上。關於通貨之無稽傳說。嫋嫋未絕。不知財政當局於改革幣制之後。旣迭次官言。以現行之發鈔制度。仍保持有適當準備。昭示國人。則流言之來。適見其為別有作用而已。</p>

<h3>熱河軍開察北　督促王英犯綏　某方飛機迭開綏東偵察　某軍要員亦赴陣地佈置</h3>
<p>張北通信、匪軍王英、雖擔任犯綏主力、但其實力、則甚單薄、殊不堪晋綏防軍之一擊、况某方對於王英猜疑旣深、又洞知王之實力不足恃、故近特陸續西向增兵、始由熟河之圍塲抽調熱河匪軍六千、繼而又由熱河續調兩聯隊、節節開向商都附近之寳昌·康保·一帶、遙作王匪聲援、飛機十六架、業巳集停商都機塲、待機備用、四日早八時、又由多倫方面飛出六架、曾經康保在上空盤旋一週後、復行西去、當日在綏東邊境偵察一週、卽返停商都機塲、現在統計該處飛機、共有二十二架、過去未見經傳之熱河偽軍吳嘏庭、近亦忽奉某方重命、由熱河開抵商都、負督促王匪犯綏之責、查吳部的有數百人、視此情况、則戰禍當不遠矣、</p>
<p>察北各縣、地廣民稀、食糧收穫雖不甚豐、但比諸內地、則實優裕、惟自偽匪盤據以來、食口驟增、故現在亦感覺恐慌、日前張北李守信等、曾有禁糧出境之令，本月三日、王匯又重伸前令、嚴禁食糧出境、至商都·寳昌·康保·一帶之糧價、飛漲不巳、彼麥·小麥·近來每斗約漲一二角、一般貧民、莫不呌苦連天、</p>

<h3>石王在旗逝世　繼承問題尙未正式决定　暫推沙格旦爾加布代理</h3>
<p>包頭通信、西公旂札薩克石拉布多爾濟、因患痢疾、於上月三十日晚在旂逝世、噩耗傳出、蒙漢民衆均極哀悼、石王無子女、僅遺一妻一妾、繼承問題、尙未正式决定、已由該旂全體官員、公推一等台吉沙格旦爾加布、暫行代理王位、沙刻在綏、日內卽返旂就職、喪事尙未辦理、擬待秘書霍松齡·六對官府包爾格林·及處長王陞等、由包返旂後主持、治安問題、有蒙兵分駐各地、决保無虞、茲將詳情誌後、</p>
<p>患病情形</p>
<p>本年八月間、西公旂變亂發生後、石王率部倉卒應變、席不暇暖、辛勞備嘗、精神上不免受損、體質旣弱、燥濕從而侵之、遂於亂平後來包不久、卽染痢疾、九月下旬、石王以在包水土不宜、乃返旂調養、詎石王及其家屬、均迷信釀禱、而不信任醫藥、故返旂後、卽請啦嘛、屢次釀禱、病况亦時輕時重、至上月下旬、病忽轉劇、釀禱無效、卒於上月三十日晚間逝世、享年四十三歲、噩耗傳出、無論蒙漢官民人等、莫不同聲哀悼、</p>
<p>料理後事</p>
<p>石王逝世後、所有重要官員、多數不在旂、暫由其夫人主持料理後事、按蒙俗、王公死後、不入棺、只着壽衣、端坐於椅上、請啦嘛設壇禱祝、待哀禮舉行完畢後、卽葬於修妥之浮圖內、石王壽衣日內卽由包購備、送旂穿着、石王夫人、精通漢語、兼通漢文、故石王初逝時、由夫夫親自書函通知各方、石王秘書霍松齡、三隊官府包爾格林·及該旂駐包辦公處長王陞等、刻均在包頭、俟該旂汽車於日內來包後、卽同乘汽車返旂、主持正式舉辦喪事、</p>
<p>繼承問題</p>
<p>石王自民國十九年卽王位、共計在位六年、無子女、亦少近族、逝世後、僅遺一妻一妾、妻年二十三歲、妾年十九歲、石王尙有一堂弟三保官府、為人無才幹、不足以當大位、故繼承問題、刻尙未决定、現已由全旂官員、公推該旂一等台吉沙格旦爾加布、暫行代理王位職權、一等台吉、為王以下第一權大者、總攪一切旂務、沙格旦爾加布前在綏蒙會任實業處長、現任該會參議、日前石王受行政院停職處分時、王位卽係由沙代理、刻沙在綏、巳得到通知、日內卽返旂就職、該旂已派沙子四隊官府為代表、由旂啟程、前往綏垣迎接乃父沙格旦爾加布返旂、沙為人頗實能、為全旂官民所信仰、故一般人預料、將來或者由沙正式繼位、</p>
<p>治安無虞</p>
<p>該旂自亂平後、全旂兵備大加整頓、早經分別駐防於各地，故月餘以來、該旂不肖歛跡、極為平靖、石王逝世後、各地蒙兵、更加嚴密戒備、故治安可保無虞（三日）</p>

<h3>獻機祝禱足球大賽　法商三比二克東華　上半時一比一法商陣容殊强固　市長開球觀衆八千情緒熱烈</h3>
<p>海上足球盟主法商隊、本季實力、尤勝往年、昨以人村之平均、陣容之强固、以三比二擊敗東華、是為本屆足球賽最精彩之一幕、觀其比數之接近、可想像競爭之劇烈、而兩隊球藝如何、亦卽可以此比數評定、昨日天氣和煦、陽光艷麗、申園球塲四周、的七八千熱心球迷、作熱烈之呼喊、造成本季球賽首次盛况、收入的有四五千元、是欵如數充獻機祝壽之舉、茲記其經過如下、</p>
<p>全局槪觀是賽熱烈興奮、兩隊均演出美麗之姿態、球國迷民、無不認為相當滿意、然東華陣綫、實未見十分完整、足證上海足球運動之漸趨衰落、老將漸見老態、後秀人材、猶少相當造詣、是以華人精萃會集之東華隊尙不能成一完美之師、反觀法商隊陣容較往年尤為平均、動作敏捷、脚頭强勁、攻守俱能盡如人意、故全局法商頗佔優勢、上半時雖成各一和局、而下半時之三十五分鐘內、仍無勝負、厥後之五分鐘、東華連失兩球、終未能保持小敗之局、最後一分鐘內扳回一球、成三比二之結果、</p>
<p>陣容批判</p>
<p>東華守門張榮才、確有顯著之進步、鎭靜功夫、已至爐火純靑、各種救球、俱有相當把握、內衛恢復李寗與馮運佑之老陣容、殊甚得當、李寗表演、仍如在昔之英勇、馮則不免人黃珠老之態、但尙堪應付、較李義臣為佳、陳鎮和之中堅、恰合其身份、顧尙勷與新將丁兆成、似有靑黃不接之憾、前鋒缺少聯絡、刹那間之緊要關頭、不能協力合作而收指臂之效、孫錦順昨為前鋒中表演最弱者、賈萬爾雙均屬平平、遠不如前矣、許文奎造詣尙欠、更以身體瘦小、雖勇尙嫌不足、麟經仍為最出色之人材、但終難盡如人意耳、東華如欲與法商爭奪天下、非加意訓練、力謀聯絡不可、</p>
<p>冠軍資態</p>
<p>成敗固不足以論英雄、然昨日法商之勝、殊非倖致、而昨賽雖屬表演、足瞻西聯甲組錦標前途之形勢、亦可謂兩隊爭奪本屆冠軍之前哨戰、故法商亦以最齊整之陣容應付、名將派克猶屬後備之列、各　技術、均在水平綫上、僅右翼法凡笑稍弱、此為法商所引為最大之遺憾者、華特三弟兄、一居前鋒、一任中堅、為法商之靈魂、柯萊脫與培爾、前者已恢復舊觀、後者則後生可長、俱見滿意、勞勃斯篤夫與鮑沙脫、不啻一對雄獅、衝刺之勇猛、引球之迅速、如置生死於度外、為對手最畏懼之人物、後衛馬山兒與勃琪斯、壁壘森嚴、無懈可擊、鮑賽仲之守鬥、不愧為海上第一把交椅、全隊聯絡、亦頗滿意、以其奔跑迅速、均多用遠傳、足使比賽趨於緊張激刺、悅人耳目、</p>
<p>市長開球</p>
<p>一時五十分許、市長偕其隨員跚跚入塲、就坐於主席座中、公安局軍樂隊開始吹奏、全塲觀衆鼓掌、空氣驟為之興奮、　裁判員樂秀榮出任艱鉅、初次執法、擲毫定位畢、法商面日作戰、東華得先開球權、由市長執行開球禮、一脚踢出、比賽開始、時正鐘鳴三下、法商右內鋒華特截住市長所踢之球、開始向東華進攻、數次來往後、萬象華在邊陲得戴麟經之遠傳、引至門側、被柯萊脫救出、小黑炭接送右翼、賈幼良傳中被救、許戴均甚活躍）黃毛培爾身先士卒、救球不少、小鬼鮑沙脫出沒邊疆、屢　侵擾、一次送球東華門前、法凡笑臥地力射、脚頭殊硬、榮才救成角球、</p>
<p>福將立功</p>
<p>東華解去角球之危後、陳鎭和引球而出、孫錦順交球與萬、象華啣枚疾走、進至底綫、踢至法商門前、賈幼良斜裏衝上頭頂、冲天飛去、十分鐘時、傑美華特（卽右翼小華特）在中綫邊界得球、疾馳而去、馮運佑馬失前蹄、漏過檔子、李寗反身不及、顧尙勷見球窮　、福將法凡笑已得華特之傳遞、捷足先趨、對門猛射、榮才揮動兩手、希圖撲接、球已由橫木彈入網底、觀衆為之震驚、東華開球反攻、象華得球失風、錯過良機、孫錦順兩次扣門、均未瞄準、戴麟徑一次急射、美麗悅目、惜差寸許、向門後飛出、</p>
<p>文奎妙射</p>
<p>勞勃斯篤夫與鮑休脫兩員虎將、在東華禁地東討西伐、聲色俱厲、使東華飽受驚惶、鮑氏一次在四十碼遠之急射、球平急如矢、張榮才斜飛撲救、雙方動作、俱甚優妙、東華被攻甚久、幸聯合戰錢、鞏固國防、未致隕越、三十五分鐘後、東華又透氣息、反守為攻、萬象華斜側扣關、法商中堅頂出、丁兆成還至門前、鮑賽仲托出後方、賈幼良開出角球、雙方掙扎甚久、又一度入東華門前、李寗送出、孫錦順從中搬渡、許文奎引球竄入、在罰球綫上、作最後之一舉、球由人叢中穿進、鮑賽仲見勢不妙、立卽坐地迎接球已穿進决勝綫、而入網角矣、爆竹之聲、起於普通座中、觀衆抑鬱之氣、如春雷爆發、充澈於看台之間、</p>
<p>局勢平靜</p>
<p>法商再度進攻、鮑沙脫施放冷箭、球彈橫木而下、離球鬥綫僅咫尺之地、法凡笑候個正着、祇因舉脚遲慢、被李寗趕上救出、上半時不久終了、休息再戰東華前鋒、似較振作、數度進攻、均未奏效、法商之勞勃斯篤夫兩次攻門驚險非凡、法凡笑一次頭頂、被榮才救出、孫錦順兩度打門、均不正着、戴麟經再攻、亦不得逞、法凡笑送出角球、恰到妙處、榮才斜仆隻手撈出博得掌聲不少、你來我往、雙方均無建樹、行動亦頗露倦態、局勢亦備覺沉悶、</p>
<p>禍起蕭墻</p>
<p>至三十五分鐘時、平靜之局勢、忽又為法商激動、使全塲觀衆、為之一震、小華特射球、飛向東華球門、穿過空擋、勞勃斯篤夫橫裏竄進、順勢一踢、建立奇功、三分鐘後、法凡笑又立一功、俄傾間東華連失兩球、出於意外、乃掁作精神、力圖最後之决鬥、孫錦順利用鐵腿、對法商遠射、距門有四十碼之遠、馬山兒性急慌張、意欲還踢、不料脚頭未準、球反由其脚端滑入門去、使飽賽仲措手不及、負去一球、時在最後之一分鐘間、比賽旋卽結束、法商以三比二奏凱、</p>

<h3>菊蘜</h3>
<p>— （淸癯）</p>

<h3>菊話</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>菊，是這秋季要的最應時的東西。在大商店的門口，在大旅社的樓頭，在會客室裏，在餐桌上面，總之，在我們這個東方巴黎的大都市裏，凡是高貴的紳士的漆皮鞋踏得倒的所在，總少不得有盆栽的菊花點綴着。</p>
<p>詩人們詠菊的詩，是再多不過的，而且任誰詠起菊來，總一致地推崇之為高士。不過菊為高士，似乎不該舍東籬而不居，而到我們這個紅綠的年紅燈光之下，芬芳馥郁的酒肉氛圍之中來討生活的。這一點，似乎對於不趨凡俗的菊的「花格」，發生了問題。因此，我每見專供象牙塔裏的公子哥兒玩弄的菊花，那麽憔悴地點首迎人，我總恨不得問它，「你為甚麼也要到這兒來凑熱鬧」？</p>
<p>但是在這裏，我們的話又得說回來，菊的混進這都市，自然也不是出於自願的，正像鐵絲籠兒裏的猛獸，不由自主地做着「老闆」掙錢的工具而已。這麽想來，我輩又該對於這些兒不幸的菊，表示着一百二十分的同情。</p>
<p>在花卉之中，據說菊的種類是最多，從花瓣的色彩和構造，以及花朵的形成上說來，有一千七百餘種。花朶大的，有大到像三個月的嬰孩的那顆小腦袋兒似的。這種菊花，據我的一位親戚說，在徽州曾見過一决。那時是在民國十年左右。我那親戚，是愛菊成癖的，所以特地求得一根，携歸蘇州栽植，不料橘逾淮而變枳，下年放花時，竟是變了小朶兒的消息子了。在民國十八年，他又到徽州去，菊主已物化多年，庭院荒蕪，據說那菊也早已隨主消逝了。</p>
<h3>秋日黃花</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>到了深秋，東籬名菊，傲霜吐艷，獨逞芳菲，不與百花爭雄，所以秋天的菊花，有高士之稱。菊花顏色甚多，有大紅，粉紅，深黃，淡黃，碧綠，靑，紫，白，比了祗有一種顏色的花卉，要美麗幾倍。菊花的種類，不計其數，其有數百中不同的名目，都由於花的形狀，花的顏色不同，而定出許多不同的花名，其中可分為珍品和尋常兩種，尋常的種類，種植旣易，又極普遍而異見，珍品則不容易生長，又不能常見，所謂物以希為貴，不多見的種類，便成了珍貴的佳種。在珍品中，也有很多的不同種類，如綠衣紅裳花瓣外面是淡綠，裏面却是粉紅。大金牡丹，是大紅色而有金綫，花大如牡丹一般。綠萼梅，宛如綠萼梅花。這幾種雖也都是珍品，但是還不是絕品，有一種虎爪，花瓣都似虎爪一般虎鬚，花瓣細長而蜷，與虎鬚相仿。這兩種可稱為菊花的絕品，不易得到，還有一種墨菊，菊花如墨一般的黑色，尤為罕見了。</p>
<p>藝菊在園藝中，很是困難，尤其是要想保持佳種，因珍貴名菊，到了第二年，常能變種，非惟形狀異樣，便是顏色也會改變。藝菊最要的辦法，便是扞芽，菊花在第一年開過凋謝之後，必須把菊根保護，不被霜雪所傷，到了明年三四月間，便漲發芽。一枝菊花，所結的蕊，常不止一二個，應預先把生在下面的菊蕊摘去，只留頂上的幾個，如此菊花開時，花朵便大了。</p>
<p>菊花的花瓣，可以加入食品，最著名的便是植，方能使菊生長開花這時卽須把菊芽重行扞菊花鍋，將花瓣與鷄魚蝦等生同煮，可得到一種極可口的淸香。還有把花瓣和了麵粉，入油炸黃，和糖同食，滋味的淸膄香甜，勝道玉蘭花片多。</p>
<p>持螯對菊，稱爲雅事，實則菊花的賞玩，只能在園中籬下，方可欣賞到菊花天然的丰采，生氣盎然，倘是把菊花堆在室中，上受燈光的炙逼，下受酒肴的薰蒸，菊花有知，也將為之愁眉不展，可算是遭了厄運，其是「燈下酒邊花成厄，美倒東籬處士陶」了。還有許多人，喜歡把藍紙紮堆假山，置以盆菊，稱為菊花山，那同持螯賞菊，一般的摧殘菊花，使菊花容易憔悴這都不是賞菊的眞意</p>

<h3>閒話梨香菊</h3>
<p>— 野航</p>
<p>民十三，南通農校，徵集名花數白種，舉行菊花展覽會。時張裔公濠陽小築的菊圃　負盛名，而不識張的平時無從觀賞到梨香菊，因便送會陳列，任人參觀：菊展會主持人恐參觀者不顧公德，損傷張所心愛，且有歷史價値的南中唯一的名花，專派一人管護此花。那時我正負笈崇川，曾抽暇往賞這轟動通海各屬的大內珍物。</p>
<p>花植於一康熙窑之雨過天靑色瓷盆中，高度的二呎左右，一幹三枝，莖旁不像其他菊花的叢生着幼芽，可供移植。色如梨花，　視之，白裏似泛着胭脂色，若美人早起，脂粉未施而自有一種似乎薄施脂粉的天然美哩。至於香味，猶如哀家梨，淸幽雅淡，沁人心肺：試以巾覆花，藏在囊中，香可數日不散。可貴的，也許就在此吧？嗇公曾作文以記此花的來歷。</p>
<p>辛亥前二年，他（嗇公）與浙江湯壽潛等，奔走立意，北上請願，抵都，攝政王表示竭誠歡迎：及離京南返，王貽以梨香菊一盆，且語張：花為大內珍品，盆亦老佛爺慈禧）所心愛者，他以處理某事中老佛爺意，伊為表示恩眷，始將梨香菊連盆賜下。王之移贈張氏，亦無非結好而已。</p>
<p>張得此花，屢想把它繁植傳播，可是奇怪得很，任你如何當心培植，莖旁幼芽，却一枝也沒有，嗣據藝菊有經驗的稱：如把它從盆裏取出，移植園圃，難保它不憔悴而死，因此張便斷了繁植它的心思。而終張之世，梨香菊在南通是祇有一盆的。</p>
<p>民十六秋，通海各縣菊圃均植有梨香菊，我頗為驚異，以為此花必幼芽勃發，經張氏園丁之手而流傳各縣的。那知幾經細心觀賞，覺得白色之中沒有胭脂色，香味亦較濃厚，遠不若當年所見者。</p>
<p>後來多方刺探，始知係以藝菊者稱江北一帶的南通金沙滄園種。園主孫君，具淵明癖，藝菊又極有心得，乃用科學方法，於夏初擇放白花的菊芽，覆以內儲麝香冰片，生梨皮之桂園殼，約二旬，把桂園殼輕輕移去，花時便自會有水梨香味了。自孫氏品種成功，冒牌梨香菊遂傳遍大江南北。甚至通海各屬藝菊的，也不重視這一種了。</p>
<p>張嗇公墓木早拱，孝若公子也己下世，不知道那枝曾經慈禧珍賞，由攝政王作媒介而流傳到濠陽小築來的梨香菊，在不在人世間呢？</p>

<h3>日本的菊花人形</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>我國人總是喜歡自己謙虛，頌揚人家。日本人適得其反，總是自己稱讚，壓倒人家的。他們也承認日本的菊花是從中國傳入的，但是却自稱自讚說，現在　菊方法是世界獨　了。尤其是菊花人形，是日本唯一的獨製品。作者走過好幾家花圃，看過幾處展覽會，除菊花人形是特別之外，要比我國，眞是遠甚。好在他們宣傳本領大，自然有西洋人相信菊花是日本的特產。</p>
<p>日本的菊花種類不多，顏色只有紅黃白紫褐數種，品位不高，珍品更少。因為我國人種菜，講究菊種，他們只講究式樣和種植法，所以花朶光澤式樣，幹葉肥茂，均較我為勝。盆菊價値很貴，高而且大，每盆十餘枝，價二三元。較我國花匠出售時，一元可得十餘盆，眞不可同日而語了。日人席地而坐，若供高大盆菊，將高出人頭，難於欣賞。故另有懸崖者，花枝倒掛盆外二三尺，花朶細小，密若繁星。價的半元，種類更少，為普通人所欣賞的。日人喪事及祝開店均送花揷花圈，除　子外均由菊花紮成。若菊花珍貴則决無如此犧牲，足見菊花在日本未見惹人憐愛。</p>
<p>人形卽傀儡，製造傀儡，是日本的拿手好戲有事製傀儡的工匠。小者供兒童玩弄，書齋裝飾。大者為商店作衣裳架子，遊戲塲裏表演故事。傀儡由木頭木屑等做成，形容畢肯，穿了各種衣服，可以表演一切古今中外的故事。菊花人形呢，略有變化，先將蘆葦竹枝編成軀榦，裝上傀儡的頭和四肢，衣服裝飾都用菊花紥成。因為菊花顏色的不同，便可襯出衣服的層次來。有時用靑的柏枝襯着，也能分別皺摺高低。此種人像，在菊花含苞時就紥，到開放落花時為止，至少可以維持一個月，每天夜裏大的要澆水一决，因為人形底下都有一個洋鉛水盤盛水的。</p>
<p>紥人形的菊花並非平常的種子，另有一種細枝細葉的，花小如銀角，而密集團簇。最先都種在地上，到紮像的時候，把他掘起來，任着它根部留些泥土。紮時把根部挿在竹製的軀幹裏，把花朶露出外面，作為衣服，所以菊花的花枝要一樣高低才好。菊花的枝幹易斷，故非十分細心不可。除人形之外又可將菊花紮成亭子帆船汽車等。盆大如荷花缸，缸上先以竹架紮成各種形式，然後，導着菊花椏枝，慢慢的把竹桿遮沒，成為各種形狀，更非一朝一夕之功，但其俗不可耐，殊覺可笑。日人每到秋季，觀菊花人形，執鬧異常。若要尋」枝名種，則恐踏破鐵鞋，亦無覓處的。</p>

<h3>中國幣值沒有測量的標準</h3>
<p>— 譚秉文</p>
<p>近年各地都有物價異常變動的報吿，有些人以為是收買換縱的結果，有些人以為楚偶然的一時的現象：不侫却認此為中國幣値沒有測量標準的結果。</p>
<p>筆者會屢次說過（在經濟專刋裏也說過）：新貨幣政策太重視了外匯，太忽視了物價——一直到現在還是那樣。自然，在亟求外國借欵和投資的中國，如果沒有外匯穏定的保證，他國是有點　　過慮的。所以我並不像那些機械論的學者們，無含蓄地反對外匯。然而我以為新貨幣政策的核心，應該是物價穩定。站在大衆的立塲說話，無疑義地物價協定比外匯穩定要重要得多。Normal　Lombard在MonetaryStatemanship一書裏說得好：外匯的穏定僅和對外貿易及投資方面有關係，物價穩定（也就是貨幣對內價値的表現）則連窮鄉僻壤的三家邨也馬上受其惠。因為這樣，我曾把物價穩定比做「熊掌」，外滙穩定比做「魚」，孟老夫子說得好：「舍魚而取熊掌者也」——當兩奢不能得兼的時候。</p>
<p>事實上在今日中國情形講，兩者並不是不可得兼，——祇是我們不要兼得吧了，自從一九三五年十一月實施新貨幣政策之後，當軸者把外滙Pegging起來，多少已經加入英鎊集團。結果很圓滿，一年來外滙可沒有什麼風險，這在某種程度內使貿易和投資順利發展，其功不能湮沒。為什麽把物價完全忽視呢？為什麽對於物價穩定方面祇採些救急的方法，不像穩定外滙那樣，在愼思熟慮裏尋找在理論上實踐上都妥善的方法，在新貨幣政策實施的前後，物價作變態的運動，於是熱鬨鬨的組織什麽物價平市委員會，後來便無聲無臭。最近物價冉度作異常波動，便又組織什麼平市委員會。這都是些救急辦法，不濟於事的，我們需要樹立穩定物價的百年大計。</p>
<p>為什麽我設中國幣値（這裏專指對內價値）沒有標準來測量呢？這點値得加以較詳細的說明。我們知道，在金屬本位的國家，紙幣沒有發展的時候，那時候測量一國貨幣價值是本位幣的金屬重量及成色。祇要本位幣的金屬重量及成色沒有變動，那麼如果其他因素不變的話，一國幣値也穩定不變，以後，紙幣發展了，就是金本位或銀本位的國家，流通貨幣主要的是紙幣，再决是支票，然後才是金幣或銀幣。在這時候，要知道幣値有沒有變動，主要的還是要看看發劵準備額增减的趨勢。這時候各國幣値的指標，可以說是發鈔準備額。發鈔準備率漸漸减低，是因為巿上通貨多了，也就是通貨價値低落的表現。反轉來講，發鈔準備率的過高，是通貨價値高勗的反映。這兩者都不是良好的現象，最好是準備率總是和法定準備奉相近。在上述兩種制度下，維持幣値的根據，便是金屬本位幣的重量和成色的穩定，以及金屬準備率的穩定。可是在紙幣本位之下情形就不同了，金幣或銀幣已經不鑄造，就是鑄造也沒有什麽重大意義，祗是點綴點綴吧了。同樣的準備金率，也往往不要嚴格遵守，雖然在表面上英國一九三二年放棄金本位後還是維持一億二千六百萬億證劵準備外其餘發鈔以十足現金　準備一的老法，美國也不取消百分四十的發鈔現金準備額。就是我們中國，百分之六十現金準備的規定，依然屹然不動。可是這除了穏定人心之外，沒有別的用意，直截了當說，祇是作為裝飾門面之用而已。究竟裏面的準備是怎樣，我們不去問牠，也用不着問牠。穏定外滙，不是把基金擺在中國裏面可以辦得到的，這點我們不要誤會了當軸者。總之，政府在穩定外滙方面，無論在技術上理論上都我不出破綻。話不要說得遠了，在管理的紙幣本位之下，像中國現在那樣，要知道幣價增减可有什麽方法，現在為止巳經採用了什麽方法沒有？我要坦白的說，方法可有，而且是半現成的，政府好像忽視物價——忽視與老百姓關係密切的現象，還沒有在這卞面花工夫。那就是說，中國還沒有拿什麽東西測量貨幣對內的價值，雖然牠巳經拿英鎊做了測量其貨幣對外的價値的標準。</p>
<p>他國都差不多一致的拿物價指數做測量本國幣值的標準，在實行了紙幣本位之後。那就是說，從物價方面觀察其增高或低降，便知道了幣値的變動，從而拿這做根據，以决定發鈔的基準。誰都知道，在紙幣本位或管理通貨下，發鈔的膨脹是很容易發生的。如果不拿一樣一具體可靠的東西來做根據，毫無目的地進行，豈不是等於「盲人騎瞎馬，夜半臨深池」了嗎？一年來中國的情形好像這樣，在外匯方面有打算，在物價方面一點也不。我們要知道，在Pegging的方法下，國內發鈔數量對於外滙一點沒有影響。所以那些夢想以外匯率的穩定以也測知中國幣値變動的人，一定是矢敗的。</p>
<p>以為這次物價的變動，不是一朝一夕所能造成的，更不是基於什麼例外的因素，如一般人所推測那般。牠是佔一年來潛伏了許多現在才爆發出來的，如果我們現在還不積極設法防止（現在亡羊補牢猶未晚），將來恐怕還要造成極大的物價波動。在管理通貨下，如果缺乏一種中心政策，要變成了不管理的通貨，人們反要被通貨所管理了。德國法國　前車可鍳，我們中國豈能步人家的後塵？自然，因為局勢的還算比較常態化，所以月前决不致酿成怎麼嚴重的局面，然而非常時期是冉冉　將至了，還不趁這時機調節物價機構—也就是貨幣機構，更待何時？</p>
<p>如果Gustav　Cassel的購買力平價說果是眞理，那麼我還要推論如果物價—貨幣對內價值—弄不好，匯價—貨幣對外價值也是弄不好的。所謂貨幣機購買力平價說，大槪就是這樣的一種理論：在用金或銀國與紙幣本位國—或者在紙幣本位國彼此之間，外匯的决定是兩國物價的對比。那就是說，到底還是物價决定了匯價。物價機構順利化，那麼匯價機構自然可以獲得調整，否則專謀匯價穩定，更而徒勞無功。僅考慮外匯穩定而忽視物價穏定的先生們，對於gustav　Cassel的理論難道認爲一點也不値得參考嗎？</p>
<p>我再重複說，中國幣值缺乏一種測騐標準，如果這樣因循下去，將會引起大大的物價恐慌。這决不是杞人憂天的話，行動而缺乏一定政策，其危險性是顯而易見的。抑有進者，這樣繼續下去，外匯的穩定也不見得能維持多久。</p>
<p>本篇所着重的，是在乎指示出中國貨幣對內價値缺乏一定標準那件事實。至於應該採取甚麽標準，以及關於這標準的理論與實際種種問題，在本文範圍內不能够詳細提供出來。筆者於此祇能很簡單的作下列結論：我們對付物價方面的變動，不能採臨時救急的方法，而應該奠立一貫的改策。至現在為止，在貨幣上穩定國內幣値的根據，除了物價指數外再沒有旁的東西了。雖然有的人以為還應該參照其他種種指數，如生產指數，夏傭指數，證劵價格指數，市塲利率（地租，房金，利潤等均在內），工資指數，生活費指數諸項。然而那種細節不是一時講得盡的，索性不講了。好在躉售物價指數之為貨幣對內價値的最佳指標這一理論，差不多是被人們普遍接受了。其他指數，不過用來參考參考吧了。</p>
<p>要採取的標準决定了，其次還要考慮一穏定幣値的基準時期，要將中國物價（也就是貨幣對內價値）穩定在一九三五年新貨幣政策下的水準呢，還是另外找出什麽基期？這當然不是個人所能够正確回答的，這需要多數人共同討論才能决定。筆者祇能提示一點原則：這水準應該能够代表「常態發展時期」，而且對於一般經濟應該有利無害。能够合乎這原則的，可以拿來做穩定物價的標準。旣然有這二原則，得來便不甚費工夫了。</p>

<h3>新金本位下匯兌基金的運用</h3>
<p>— 包玉墀</p>
<p>自法郞眨値以後，英美法三國，訂立貨幣恊定，共同維持新金本位：國際通貨戰爭的熱浪，暫見减退。最近法郞美元的匯兌，穩定在二一·四〇法郞左右，同時英鎊與美元的匯價，亦漸漸接近四元八角六分。鎊元法郞的穩定，由於二國政府的干涉，匯兌基金的運用，顯而易見，惟其活動的內幕，未經政府的宜佈。</p>
<p>現在國際金融巿塲上，連荷蘭在內，共有四個匯兌基金，準備活動，其他各國，或尙要繼續親織，亦未可知。惟在新的貨幣局面之下，匯兌基金的運用，亦得轉變方式，改以新的姿態，提携國際的合作，庶各國匯兌基金的活動，步調一致，對於國內的信用及銀行制度，發生同樣的良好後果。</p>
<p>設以英國匯兌基金而言，根據立法的規定，黃金與國外資產（指匯票等而言）的獲得，係由於國庫券的出售。與美法兩國的匯兌基金，由於重估黃金的價值而產生，根本不同。故英國匯兌基金的重要資產，就是國庫券。基金帳內，黃金與國外資產的增加，卽為出售國庫券數量的增加，巿塲供給額的增加，或銀行國庫券持有額的增加；反之，基金帳內黃金與國外資產的减少，當然卽為國庫券的購進了。英國卽用此種調節的方式，維持節價，效果頗佳。</p>
<p>假定法國向倫敦的銀行，收回資金一百萬鎊，對於倫敦巿塲。當然發生嚴重的影響。此時英國的匯兌基金，卽可盡其騙實，出而干涉了。法國旣提取存欵一百萬鎊，英倫的銀行，勢必以英金一百萬鎊，購進一〇五百萬法郎抵付。英國匯兌基金，卽在巴黎巿塲，金一百萬鎊，購進一〇五百萬法郞；再在倫敦市場，出售與銀行。由銀行撥付基金一百萬鎊，故英倫銀行的銀行存欵帳內撥出一百萬鎊，轉入公家存欵帳內。基金帳內，收到一百萬鎊後，隨收買國庫劵；市場上國庫劵的供給，卽有同等數量的减少。結果為銀行現金額的膨脹，銀行仍收回現金一百萬鎊，惟將减少國庫劵或以國庫劵爲擔保放欵一百萬鎊。上述的情形，如以下列簡單的表格表示，更易明瞭。</p>
<p>上述變化的結果，銀行存欵及國庫券與短期放欵减少，現金則暫時沒有變動；銀行的現金比例增加，又可以增多放欵，及購買證券了。故倫敦巿塲，法國資金的收回，英國匯兌基金喪失黃金二百萬鎊，反足以圓滑市塲的信用，遞减銀行的放欵利率呢。</p>
<p>至對於巴黎市塲的影響怎樣呢？自倫敦提回的一〇五百萬法郞，悉數轉入商業銀行；法國當局，向匯兌基金購入値一〇五百萬法郞的黃金，存入法蘭西銀行，增加其黃金準備。此項一〇五百萬法郞，係由英國匯兌基金經售與國內銀行再由銀行抵付法國的商業銀行。法國的商業銀行，卽以之存入法蘭西銀行現金帳內。故法國銀行的存欵與現金，同時增加。巴黎金融市塲，因資金的歸流，信用更見圓活了。</p>
<p>國際資金的流動，因各國匯兌基金的調節，均能發生一致的良好影響，這就是基金存在的好處了。</p>
<p>現在英美法三國，雖巳訂立了貨幣協定，法國亦設立了匯兌平衝基金；惟三國基金的運用，在技衛上，必須開誠布公，取一致的步驟，則三國的貨幣，始有穩定的希望，若仍各懷異心，明爭暗鬥，國際貨幣的戰爭，將更變本加厲，永無休止了！</p>

<p>吾國生絲出售單位，在本國絲按百斤計算，如每包或每擔等於若于元是，日本亦然。在英美則以磅計，如現紐約標準絲每磅一元六角，則合華絲應以一元六角乘一百三十三磅（合一華擔）冉以對美滙率除之始得。法國生絲則以基羅格蘭姆為單位（卽吾國現行標準制之公斤）每六十基羅格蘭姆合吾國一擔，在法郞未行貶値之前，法國市塲之華絲假定每基羅格簡姆値六十法郞，每擔六十基羅格蘭姆，應為三千六百法郞，以對法匯率國幣一百元等於法郞四六四二一五法郞（九月念五日中央銀行掛牌法滙行市）換算，應値國幣七百七十餘元，除去每擔五十元開支，尙有七百二十餘元。但自法郞貶値而後，法滙劇降，近日中央銀行掛牌，國幣百元，合六百三十法郞，則每啟羅格蘭姆六十法郞之華絲，原價每擔可値七百七十餘元，現僅値五百四十餘元，再除去開支五十元則餘四百九十餘元矣。故法郞貶値之結果，華絲在滙兌上所受之損失，最少在二百元左右，若不將價格提高，則虧蝕自將不堪。但苟提高價格，則於銷售方面，必感困難，輸法數量，更有减少之虞。故法郞貶値，實卽華絲外銷以重大之打擊也。</p>
<p>但從另一方面觀察，此次法郎貶值之時，會有一更重要之設施，卽法國與英美兩國，訂立貨幣協定，且其貶值成分，亦以平衡國內外物價爲限，非欲藉貶值以攻擊他國者可比，故吾人以為法郞貶値，為世界貨幣戰休止之表徵，貨幣戰休止，匯兌得趨於安定之途，且關稅之减低，亦肇其端。（法意等國，此次减低幣値之後，繼以减低進口關稅，英法兩國，並向國聯經濟委員會提議，取銷進口限額，及匯兌管理制，則不久將來，定有關稅休戰之實現）自由貿易，倘再得抬頭之機會，則世界經濟繁榮，生絲消費，自有增加之可能。况現在生絲市塲，已由里昂轉為紐約與橫濱神戶，吾人不見夫最近法國華絲價格已隨日美絲市高漲而上升，B級華絲每啟羅格蘭姆已漲至八十七法郎，合國幣八百餘元，美日絲市高漲，里昂不能狂跌也。不過世界經濟繁榮，國際貿易復興，究尙有待，里昂絲市之停頓，消費之减少，亦足以影響日美市價之上漲耳。故法郎貶値，於將來或可因世界貿易復興，增加生絲之消費，但目今則以滙兌換算之驟然變動，輸法生絲，顯受阻碍，尤以吾國生絲，法銷重要，受創最深，欲渡此難關，維有提高出品，减低生產費用，努力推銷之一法，能善利用時機，來日發展，未始無望，不能因時制宜，則打擊之來，祗有加速沒落之日期而已。</p>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 德國醫學博士張君實著</p>
<h3>結婚與健全的性生活</h3>
<p>雄壯碩性能健全的偉文丈夫為新婦女理想的配偶　性機能發生障礙一筆勾消新婦女理想的配偶　性機能發生障礙一筆勾消了閨房歡樂常致賦仳離　願為情天補此恨醫藥界何少妙法領你上人生樂園</p>
<p>所謂圖式的愛情—純粹的精神愛者，只是一些情場失意者用以自慰的美名罷了，真正完全的變愛無不以男女雙方的結合為極致。除了精神上的共鳴外，結婚卽是夫婦間性活活的開場白。健全的性生活則又是夫婦間感情之唯一的維繫。性生活決非男子單方面的歡樂，而係男女雙方之滿足。</p>
<p>白面書生的時代過去了，新婦女所需要的不是虛飄飄的愛，郤是結實而有力的，惟有性面能健全的丈夫方能使婦人醉心於他的懷抱中。</p>
<p>如果體格衰弱，性力不健全，夫婦之間只會感受到淡薄的不滿，婦人永不會沈醉於丈夫的懷裏，愛情的炎燄兒頭給澆上一陣冷水，怎能不消滅枯萎下去呢？</p>
<p>鄙視着丈夫，享不到閨房歡樂的妻子，在進步開明的現代社會中，自然會堅決地下堂求去。</p>
<p>這樣的男子是頂可憐的，人生的樂園對他關上了門，不得徘徊於灰色的道中，追憶痛苦之由來。</p>
<p>有的是：少年時充滿着愛慕少艾之念，臥思夢想，遂與奮起來，由手淫以求得滿足。於是正在猛長的生殖腺因過早和過度的使用而損壞，精神與肉體上也消失了多量的精力，遺精，早洩，陰萎，發育不全等病便如雨後春筍，到處滋生。</p>
<p>有的是：結婚過早，從慾無節，也產生了與上述相同的疾病。更有的是：性好治遊，結識些野草閒花，致身染淋毒，連帶地誘起性神經衰弱症狀</p>
<p>對於這些人，真能為之補情天此恨的只有奧國斯丹那博士發明的『生殖素』一藥，他積二三十年之研究，採取雄壯動物的生殖腺素，以科學方法，精煉成藥，所以確具健全生殖腺的功效，為性神經衰弱症的唯一良藥。生殖腺旣健全有力，局部的發育也能完全，陰萎早洩等病自然逃　無蹤。</p>
<p>至於患有遺精病者，同時應用德國希米脫博士配製的『希米脫氏固精片』，遺精自然立止。患有淋病的，同時應服黃色素及伐克辛之合製劑『安敵淋』，將尿道前後黏膜內外的淋病變球菌消嚴。如此則諸病悉愈，定能成為性能健全的偉丈夫了。</p>

<h3>消滅骨痛的病源</h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>……貢獻一種釜底抽薪的治療法　……袪濕除瘋健身滅淋缺一不可</p>
<p>骨痛病患者十之七八為中年以上人士，壯年人從有患此的，也均係孱弱不堪者。原因是：骨痛之病源不外操勞過度，縱慾無節，風濕內蘊，傳染淋毒等幾項。體魄强健，精力旺盛的人，抵抗力充足，病魔便無從潛入，待你衰弱老朽，便乘機混進，大事活動了。</p>
<p>因此，對於一般醫療骨痛的方法，我們就不免起着深深的懷疑。一般的方法正犯「頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳」之弊，專以防止骨痛為務，結果，暫時雖能收效，不久以後，郤又捲土重來。並且僅就專門治骨痛而言，這些普通藥品的效力也是不很確實的。</p>
<p>最優良的療法必得雙管齊下，五方面以具有去濕除瘋，清血止痛的偉大效力之『强斯登氏骨痛片』，使病人內服，將血液中的尿酸打掃得乾乾淨淨，自然會覺得身輕體健，疼痛停止。另一方面我們還得要直取病源，將再發的可能性消滅，所謂引起骨痛之可能性者不外衰弱與淋毒，對於衰弱，患者應內服『生殖素』，以促進生殖腺之內分泌，精力自能充沛，病魔雖欲進攻，抵抗力之强大總可以將其擊退。對於淋毒，惟有內服黃色素伐克辛的合製劑『安敵淋』，力能掃蕩一切淋菌，增加抗毒力量。能如此治療，正像斬草除根，可以永絕後患，苦於此症者不可不知。</p>
<p>青年的性教育</p>
<h3>手淫促成遺精弊害的面面觀</h3>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>……春情發動期為青年開始負起繁殖人類使命的第一步　……肉體變化精神的煩惱身體某部份的緊張在在發現</p>
<p>男子的青春期，是從十五歲到二十五歲，由童年踏進成年生活，所以我們稱之為青春期。在青春期裏的青年，又給導入一個腦質與體質的變遷，此變遷會作成這個時期的第一期。或是走到成人期的第一步，我們稱牠為『春情發動期，』這個春情發動期，有二三年的時光，通常為十六歲至十八歲，在這個時期青年就能產出大量精液，來負起　以完成人類繁殖的使命。就是承認青年在他的發展上已達到了生殖的發展階段。未來的健良基礎，完全在這個時期開始奠基了。可是這個時期，是充滿錯誤與危險的時期，肉體的變化，精神的煩惱，身體某部份的緊張，在在能諉發過失，蹈入青年的黑暗陷阱中，其中最顯著者，就是對於性器發達，慾火上昇，在內的方面，容易流為手淫癖，在外的一方面，容易犯上錯誤，受環境的誘感，破壞了青年童貞，那確有加以充分注意的必要！</p>
<p>據多數醫學者研究所得：青年中有百分之九十以上，一達到適當年齡，就會犯上手淫惡癖。賢明的父母，對於達到適當年齡的子弟，是否玩弄着手淫行為，其動機是否由於誘惑，抑或不隨意地發生，不可不詳細觀察一下。若果然曉得他們確犯了此種惡癖，不消說，自須加以相當訓誡。這時，如發現已受弊害，應速利用鞏固精關法，施以積極治療，即有顯著效果。</p>
<p>關於手淫後所爆發的遺精症候，其弊害傳說紛紜，基於醫學的眼光觀察。除精經衰弱症之外。能阻止性器的發育。並能促成陰萎，早洩的性神經衰弱症。所以其弊害的範圍，確實深大。</p>
<p>挽救這種弊害，最好方法，莫妙於趕快服以「希米脫氏固精片」該藥不僅能使精關治固，遺精停止。同時可使你意志强，慾念清純。遺精停止之後，所有由遺精引成的一切衰弱症象，如健忘，失眠，頭昏腦脹及陰萎早洩，發育不全等，當以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』服之，種種弊害都能澈底根治。</p>
<p>性病講座</p>
<p>— 姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　門診上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息</p>
<p>（一）因手淫誘起的陽萎症</p>
<p>患者張達人，年廿五歲，杭州人。主訴——生來健康，不知疾患，體格中等，營養佳良。不幸於十七歲剛發育時躭溺手淫。致遺精頻繁，而手淫惡癖與日俱增，强壯的身體怎敵無限的遺洩。直至廿三歲結婚手方得戒絕此惡癖，然已虧　不堪。故進行房事時，性器舉而不堅，差不多不能營充分性交，近且愈形惡化，蓋已完全喪失性機能矣。彼雖知為手淫之故，但尚有一原因，不得不告，蓋張君尚患有先天性的包莖。衹露一微細小的小空以排尿。故雖用手指使包皮翻退時，龜頭亦不能露出，（治療方法）——先施以局部麻醉，將包皮先端收縮處割去少許，成環狀。縫合〇三十分鐘完全畢事。經過絕無痛苦，再張君病原由於生殖腺的摧殘，致精關受損而鬆懈。除服以强壯生殖腺的良藥生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」使其性能恢復。同時並以鞏固精關的遺精特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」服之。復為之每月施行電氣療法，攝護腺部施以按摩，一月後，性能已感健全，而遺精已止。共服兩月，不僅諸病消失，且精神特別充足，食慾亢進異常。其最顯著者為體重之增加，性器之長度驟增六分。</p>
<p>（二）早婚絕嗣的有效挽救</p>
<p>患者包勇仁，年廿九歲，安徽巢縣人。主訴——結婚十一年尚未生育，父母因溺愛之故，十八歲卽為之娶妻。蓋本人為獨生子。且父母生彼時均年已五十將近，未免先天不足，加之發育尚未完成時，卽進入兩性生活。故結婚之後，卽罹早洩症。且妻子身體亦弱，月經亦時時不調。故不姙的原因，雙方均有過失請治。（治療方法）——診得包君生殖器細小。除使其嚴守養生之道外，並為之服以男用「生殖素」以增加性力，恢復發育。並以女用「生殖素」令彼夫人照夫，使彼之月經調整，生殖機能亢進，是如經過兩月，包君發育轉佳，性能增强，彼之夫人月經凖確，今秋故已姙娠矣。</p>
<h3>白帶治法</h3>
<p>蘇洲水潭巷陳景時君來函云；彼之夫人身體素弱，故月經不調，且白帶甚多。所患上述兩症，已有四年之久，雖多方治療。絕少效果，旋於今夏購得女用『生殖素』以調養月經，及外用「療帶靈」止白帶之後，以前之病，竟得完全治好云。</p>
<h3>胃痛獲救</h3>
<p>編輯先生：胃之苦，真難以形容，我不幸罹　已歷三載。我之有此病，自知完全由於飲食不調，且嗜食生冷之故，今夏得朋友介紹朋以「胃痛靈」之後，竟得治愈，同時因胃口不佳，故兼服「健胃素」，現半年中不僅胃痛從未一發，且食慾亢進，身體的强壯，得未曾有。（羅敏攸）</p>
<h3>淋病根治</h3>
<p>先生：余不幸身患白濁，當初因誤服虛偽廣告的某某合製劑，因此由急性而轉入慢性。計之已患三年矣。今幸得同病者指示合製劑的優劣。復購得黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』此確具實效，共服三盒，竟得根治（許竟成）</p>
<h3>始知假藥</h3>
<p>編輯先生：今得上海各大報新聞欄十一月四日所載大東藥房因偽造『生殖素』及『希米脫氏固精片』被捕房破案云云。始知余上月所購之紙盒瓶裝者卽為該項冒牌貨，服後一無效騐，乃卽指購鐵盒裝置上述兩藥之真貨。服後至今，衹及五日，已覺效騐顯然。假藥之害人，真不淺也（常州王成德）</p>
<p>戒煙常識</p>
<h3>戒煙失敗者將何往？</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>自已不思自拔而甘心觸犯刑章的煙民，我們本不必為之掬同情這淚。可是另外一批煙民之身入囹訚，郤不免使人深覺不忍。他們早就覺得受盡煙霞之累，極顧早日戒除，郤因屢次甞試，均遭失敗，致遷延至今。</p>
<p>對於這一羣人，我們器界人士願貢獻最安全可靠之培補戒煙法以脫其危，這種方法是試過他種方法而失敗者所能走的唯一坦途。</p>
<p>試想：為什麼凡用普通方法戒煙，戒者均以痛苦難堪而重吸呢？自然是煙毒深入身體各部組紛織，使其細胞全部麻醉，非受煙的刺激不能運動，所以停止或減少煙量後，缺乏刺激，內分泌以及新陳代謝作用均入於停頓狀態，於是痛苦不堪了。</p>
<p>培補戒煙法即自此方面着手，使戒者內服生殖腺素製劑鐵盒「生殖素」，促進生命源泉的生殖腺內分泌，使體力充沛，鼓動全身各組織之運轉，使戒者不必煙的刺激，後體內生出新的生命辦，與煙毒對抗。所以能夠毫無痛苦地戒除，普通不過四五星期，卽可戒絕，而且永遠不思復吸。</p>
<p>有患者閔偉才，年四十四，自十五歲時卽吸，至今幾達三十年，以前亦曾甞試各種藥方，戒過四次，非但均半途而廢，且吸量反因之增加。近見煙藥禁日嚴，個人經濟力又非寬裕，繼續吸食，實不勝其恐懼之心及負担之重，故謀再試一戒，經余投以大量之鐵盒裝「生殖索」，一個半月後，三十年舊癮竟得除去，面色紅潤，體氣轉佳矣。</p>
<h3>健康公論　骨痛的原因與治法</h3>
<p>— 俞伯符醫師</p>
<p>骨痛的爆發，完全由於其人體質漸衰之故。雖然人類個個免不掉衰老及死亡。可是有許多未到相當年齡卽已衰老。其衰老的最顯著者，莫如骨痛之發作。本症是包括數種病症。從腰背酸痛直至全身的骨節疼痛，手足麻木，甚至半身不遂，中風死亡！然而本症的演變，幾為有一定不移的軌道。如腰背酸痛過久之後，或漠視治療，或治療不當，則必蔓延及於全身，如再惡化，則半身不遂症無可幸免，甚至因此發生生命之虞。</p>
<p>關於本症促成的原因，為瘋濕內蘊，血份不潔。此外動脈硬化等。故最可靠的治法，必須服以「强斯登氏骨痛片」因該藥確具袪瘋，除濕，清除血毒及預防動脈硬化的功能。服後骨節頓形輕鬆，復元甚速。</p>
<p>患者胡國文，年衹卅五歲，彼完全因早年的瘋濕積累，及中年的血分不潔，故久有腰背酸痛症。因治療不當，蔓及全身，發作時陷於半身不遂壯態，苦不堪言。旋由朋友介紹服以「强斯登氏骨通片」之後，連服三盒，病卽霍然根治矣。</p>
<p>生育與美容</p>
<h3>康强的小孩必求之健美的母親</h3>
<p>— 香港大學醫科學士吳大超</p>
<p>誰不願意自已的孩子康强壯健，活潑可愛，然而這樣的孩子是只有健美的母親方能產生的。身體衰弱，面色蒼白，肌肉瘦削，乳部平坦，月經不調的病態女子如何能生產壯健的孩子呢？</p>
<p>更進一步言，這種女子不只是難於產生良好嬰兒而已，首先，她們就喪失了美觀，優美的曲線，高聳的乳峯，紅潤的面色和她們是無緣的。瘦削醜陋是必然的結果。</p>
<p>關於不姙的原因，除佔染淋病之外，則為月經不調，卵巢的內分泌（卽生殖腺素）缺少，白帶過多，至喪失受孕的機能</p>
<p>除了從帶服用可靠的藥品以求健美外，她們決沒有第二條路可以生育康强的小孩</p>
<p>最優秀之藥品為生殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素」，能使發育完美，乳峯高聳，曲線畢呈，肌膚腴美，並能治愈月經不調等症，創製者斯丹那博士在奧京維也納一處所治愈乳部平坦之女子今年已達三萬餘人，世界各地舉行賽美時，參加者往往服用此藥而名列前茅。</p>
<p>白帶過多當自用「療帶靈」外用藥為坐藥，功能清除腔道。染有淋病的宜內服伐克辛和黃色素的合製劑「安敵淋」，力可透膜殺菌，不傷胃腸，絕無副作用之發生。這幾種藥功效確實，確係婦女之恩物，衰弱不姙及研究美容者宜注意及之</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「襟頭花」和「捐欵」</h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>廣州是革命發源地，近來則也是復古的大本營，什麼「拉摩登」念古書，男女分泳等花樣經，幾乎全是從那邊出發的，卽使是給人搶了先，始創有人了罷，也不敢爲後，過不了多久，便卽起而響應了，這響應是衷心的，所以到沒有什麽地域之見，（現在是統一了，當然例外）有時候並且還賣力得比發起者更甚。</p>
<p>關於妓女佩帶「襟頭花」　件，廣州是什麼時候起始的，這個倒不大清楚。而比較近一點的，例如南京等處，則好像曾經鬧過「桃花章事件，歌女妓女之所以要反對佩帶、桃花章，」理由是歌女妓女亦入也，况且羞恥之心，人皆有之，佩了「桃花章，」不是明明白白的吿訴了她們的「身份」了嗎？是烏可！另一方面呢，呌你佩「桃花章」原是要和「良家婦女」有所區別，所以前者所提出的理由，也就成了理由不足，現在結果如何？似乎並無下文；好在這與本文無關，也大可不必追問下去。而從報上所吿訴我們的，則廣州妓女是要佩帶，並且是佩帶着「襟頭花」的。</p>
<p>最近，則廣州的妓女也可以有「例外」了，據大晚報的廣州通訊說，「籌欵委員會為獎勵熱心妓女起見，規定如每名妓女能担任勸捐得欵項五十元以上者，准予免帶襟頭花半年，以資鼓勵之。」</p>
<p>妓女亦人也，募欵購機，以充國防，這是每個國民的義務，是義不容辭的。要獎勵熱心者起見，自然也可以，但希望不要把她們見外，以捐欵來作為取消她們「標識」的代價。不然，面子上固然是「以資鼓勵，」而骨子裏却依舊不把她們當作「人」看待。這與初衷似乎稍有違背。—雖然這正是由來巳久的事情，但何苦在「以資鼓勵的時候再讓自已露一下形呢。</p>
<p>以捐欵五十元作為「免帶襟頭花半年」的代價，效果或許是會比無條件的來得大些，但不幸而言中，則這已不是熱心於國家的表示，而是成為「捐班」性質了。如果這樣，一向為大人先生們看作下賤的妓女，為了「抬高身份，」還情有可原，而於籌欵委員會諸公，這諷刺却未免太大！</p>
<p>我生得太晚，關於滿淸的捐班制度也就不大詳細；但是，那些捐班者的心理却是可以猜想得出的，他們想借了錢的力量來抬高自已的身份，或者，也就作為將來歛錢的工具。而「捐班」與捐欵，以情以理來說，是都應該為絕對的不同的。</p>
<p>現社會把人民分成種種等級，而又可以用錢來墊自已的脚，使得可以站得高一點，這方法巧妙則巧妙矣，於「人民是一律平等」的說來，則總太「那個」吧</p>
<p>或者說，於正人君子們的心目中，妓女本來就沒有被視為「人」啊。現在以……者，那眞是君子之本。要是眞這樣。那自然又有別論了。</p>
<p>然而，卽使是正人君子們所視為下賤的妓女，有時候於正人君子們却依舊是有用的。</p>

<h3>沉落</h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>樓底下那空了半個多月的灶披間，搬進一家人來了。</p>
<p>這一家人共有三個，一男二女。男的是一個三十左右年紀高大男子，身材瘦長，面孔乾枯黝黑，說話聲很低，像是從鼻孔里發出的，帶着很濃厚的烟癮。他穿的是一件染滿了油漬的長袍，足下登着雙黑布鞋：另一個是十七八歲年紀的胖肥女人，結着兩隻粗一辮；其他的一個是十二三歲的小姑娘，短髪，穿一件縫補過的花旗袍，面孔時常被用紅紙染得紅紅的。</p>
<p>這一家奧秘的人們，白天差不多都不在家，一大早我們就能够聽見那個小姑娘唾眼惺忪地在房門外走廊裏，用一隻破鐵鍋忙着燒飯，年靑女人就像一團肉塊似的縮在一角睡覺，中年男子則曲着身像一隻大龍蝦似的身子忙着吞烟吐霧，飯燒好了，捧進去三個人分着吃了，那個中年男子便從壁上取下了那一把破胡琴，小姑娘從床底下抱出了那一個布包袱，揹在背上，年靑女人像是永遠沒有快樂過似的，堵着一付嘴面，擺着手，遠遠地跟在他們背後，望街上走。</p>
<p>他們必需在熱鬧的地方，找到了一塊曠地，大家站着，於是小姑娘就褪下背上的袱包，打開來從裏面取出大紅袍子，假鬚，或者紙面具來：中年男子就拉動胡琴，年靑女人敲起竹板應和着，小姑娘則尖起嗓子嗚嗚的唱起來。沒多久，人們便要擠着，把他們密密地包圍起來，而所謂「滑稽京戲」也就這樣開塲了。</p>
<p>差不多每天要到七點左右，才能看見他們像一羣幽靈似的，拖着疲憊的身子回來，照例又是那小姑娘在水龍頭掏米洗菜，那差不多是從垃圾堆里檢來的。於是乎，還沒等吃過飯，吵鬧便開始了，先是那年靑的女人用筷子把碗裏的稀飯攪了一攪望桌上一摔，憤聲的呌着：</p>
<p>「你有良心，呌我們吃這比豬食還壞的飯！……」</p>
<p>中年男子便停下碗來，向她嚴厲的看了一眼，又搖搖頭說：</p>
<p>「這不能怪我，景氣不好啊！……」</p>
<p>「景氣，景氣，你老說是景氣，那麼我們每天賺來的錢呢？……」她生氣似的站起來，跑近窗子邊站住，眼里閃着怒火，「我們飢餓着，而你却寫意着抽大烟……」</p>
<p>「阿媛，你要留着舌頭說話。……」中年男子有點惶惑地說着。</p>
<p>「那個時候，你自己是怎樣對我說的。……」她沒有去理會他。「到上海去吧，在那兒我要使你過好日子，迫着我把父母丟開了，跟你到上海來，可是現在怎樣，你呌我在大家面前丟面，向人乞討，你把我騙了。……」</p>
<p>她傷心着，就大聲哭了，心裏不斷地想起了在故鄉裏底父母和田園。</p>
<p>這像一把箭尖以的刺傷着他，在這時他變得非常害怕提起往事，他不但對她失過約，而且連那小姑娘也騙了。當他從一個僻靜的地方把她拐騙出來時，他也向她說了同樣的話，可是這能怪他嗎？飢餓迫着他呀！……</p>
<p>於是他變得有點絕望了，默默的站立起來擺着兩隻手出去了。</p>
<p>在路上，他况靜地想着，檢討自己底過去和未來，他底心緒就變得非常的糾紛，忽然有一股思想橫過他底腦裏，使得他底全身都因此而發顫起來。</p>
<p>十點左右的時候，他回來了，面上露着亢奮而柔和的神氣，他搖醒了那年靑女人，而且低聲地吿訴她：</p>
<p>「阿媛，我想了一會，我覺得自己再也不能把你留住了，橫直這樣生活你是不願過下去。我要把你送回家去。……」</p>
<p>她吃驚的向他看着，這來得太突然了，然而她相信着這也許是眞的。於是她底腦子裏又幻起故鄕的父母和田園來了，她激動地點着頭，而且抓緊他底手。第二天，她給一個肥胖的漢子帶走了，接下幾天，這個中年男子和那小姑娘也搬走了。</p>
<p>這事過大約有半個月，有一天晚上，我從大世界門口經過，忽然我感覺着在我背後有一隻手輕輕的扯住我底衣角，回過頭去，却就是那個年靑女人，她似乎也看出了是我，便滿面泛紅，惶惑地縮回了手來，眼淚慢慢的溢上她底眼裏。</p>
<p>直到遠遠，我還看見她元然的站在那兒，我想她又受騙，要永遠地沉落了</p>
<h3>月台上</h3>
<p>— 韓龍臣作</p>
<h3>夜宿小客棧</h3>
<p>— 郭卡</p>
<p>—漂流瑣憶</p>
<p>有一年冬天，一個落着雪的夜裏，我在膠濟鐵路沿綫的一個小站上下了火車。在黑洞的街上，我的一件小行李，被個漢子接去後，我就跟着他到了個了小客棧裏。這小客棧門前的一盞燈，像朦朧中睜開的眼睛，惺忪的向着每一個到來的客人。</p>
<p>那店主東看見一起進來了六七個客人，就嘻嗞嗞的抱着隻水烟袋說道：</p>
<p>「客人屋裏」</p>
<p>於是我們都擁在一間有着火炕的屋裏去。</p>
<p>店小二打來兩臉盆熱水，我們六七個陌生人就互相推讓着洗起來：</p>
<p>「請這位先洗！」</p>
<p>「呵不客氣，不客氣！」</p>
<p>「您先洗，您先洗！」</p>
<p>推讓的結果我是最後洗的，每個人從不同的地方，帶來一臉風塵，這時都洗在這兩隻小臉盆裏？它那農黑油膩的色澤也就不難想像了！我閉了閉眼，好歹的把臉洗過後，就分配着住房子。我被領進裏面院子的一間小屋裏去。</p>
<p>進去時，早有兩個年靑入在裏面了，這兩人雖是一樣的年靑，却有着不同的風格，一個是地道的中學生，胖胖的穿着件呢格子大衣，看樣子很有錢，以後談起來，知道他家在濟南遠有着什麽房產跟經租賬房，神氣跟一切有錢的靑年同樣，好談東談西，却永遠不提起功課。另一個却是商店學徒，機伶小器，帶着許多零星東西，樣子像是回家過年的。他們兩個都在吃點心，一個吃的是鷄蛋糕，那學徒是吃的從外面呌來的餃子，他一邊吃着一邊抱怨這餃子不好。</p>
<p>屋子裏相當冷，這時店小二才臨時在那裏生隻媒爐子，劈柴拍拍的饗着，屋子裏孕滿了煤烟，燻得人瞇逢着眼不敢暢快的呼吸，他一邊生着爐子，還一邊像安慰這受了委曲的客人樣的說：「烟是暖帳！」</p>
<p>一會兒我們就收拾睡覺。這屋子裏有一張老大的木床，佔全屋子三分之二的樣子，上面還舖了一層薄的褥子，褥子是深藍色的，上面油膩膩有一層亮光，我們希望天一明住了雪好再乘汽車趕路，所以各入的行李都沒打開，三個人都一起躺在這冷硬的床上。</p>
<p>一面收拾着睡，一面這三個陌生的人就攀談起來，不多時相當就習了，那商店學徒有點婉惜的說：</p>
<p>「這城裏有幾個縹緻的窰姐，若是不下雪，我領你們去玩玩也好！</p>
<p>我聽了有點好笑，那中學生却問長問短的跟他談起來，聽了這商店學徒述說了這小城裏的一些故事以後，他也誇耀起濟南府的平康里什麽里起來了。</p>
<p>我躺在那裏，怎麽也睡不着，坐起來從窗子縫隙處向外望望，好像雪仍是在落，於是我非常担心着明天會開不了汽車。</p>
<p>院子裏有隻驟子不時的擺着頭，頸子上的銅鈴凄淸的叮叮的饗着。</p>
<h3>老礦工</h3>
<p>— 瑞芝</p>
<p>天才亮，換班的汽笛還沒有響，裁减工人的消息，却已經傳遍了那山坡旁一攤攤地草屋里了。消息的傳來，好似雷響一樣，除了那些還在地底下工作者之外，是誰都感到不安的，平時誰都恨那換班的汽笛響得太早不能在床里多休息一會，可是今天却個個不用汽笛來呼喚，都睡臥不安的爬起來了，不到半個鐘頭，礦山的辦公室門口，都給人頭擠滿了，一個個抬着頭的看着那大門口的壁上的兩大張人名單。</p>
<p>在這礦山里已經做了將近二十年的礦工阿成，這時也擠在人羣里，也許是年紀大了些力氣小了，他雖擠得滿身大汗，還是擠不到前頭去。看看第二次汽笛快響了，才算給他擠上前去了。他這時也抬着頭的看着那名單，一對已是失去了銳利的視力的花花的眼睛，盡力的注視着，搜索有沒有他的名字。到底已是衰老了，眼晴也失去了效力，他不但尋不到自己的名字，就是別人的名字也看不淸，這使他只有請求旁邊也在觀看的人了，可是焦心是誰都一樣的，在這時候，誰還不是在注意着自己，所以阿成的問話，沒有一個答覆他，這使他更加的焦急起來。只是一個不當心，人又被擠出外面來，可是這一來，阿成却發現了另一個聽消息的地方，那就是在舁降機旁有一個包工的頭目，在那里把名子唸給不識字的工人聽。</p>
<p>「老成，不用去看了，你的名子同我連在一起，一共裁了五百多人，眞倒霉！」</p>
<p>阿成才舉步要向昇降機那邊走去，可是同他住在一起的小金，却從人羣中擠出來，對着阿成說，他那臉孔頹喪得很蒼白。</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>「你的名子同我連在一起」這句話好像雷鳴一樣，把阿成的耳朵都震聲了，剛想走動的脚步，却停住了，眼睛像夢中剛醒轉來一樣的呆着。</p>
<p>阿成在礦山里做工，是最有歷史的了，右三千多工人中，他是一個老礦工，二十年來，破塲不知經過了多少的變故，裁工也不知多少次了，可是他還沒有逢到一次，就是十年前一次洞里失火，燒死了幾百人，他都逃出了危險，在可是這次出於意外，他的名子却在　名單上出現了。</p>
<p>換班的第三次汽笛響了，辦公室大門口的人，也漸漸地散去了，有些是依然的笑着，有些却哭喪着臉。阿成雖然聽了小金的報吿，但還不大相信，人少了，，他又走上前去，用心的注意着每一個字眼，始於「阿成」二字給他找到了。這時工作完止由洞中出來的工人，聽到了消息，一羣羣地又向大門口走來了，阿成這時只得拖着沉重的脚步走回家里去。他一面走着一面想着，想起了二十年前來做工時的年靑時代，想起了還要他寄錢回去吃飯的妻兒，想到了今後的生活，想到了他已經是四十餘歲的人，他的心，想到了一切，想到了不能再想了。跑進了草屋，一聲也不響的就躺在那木板床上。這時小金望着他說：</p>
<p>「老成，下午可以到公司去領錢呵！你比我還好，有兩個月的工錢拿呢！他媽的，老子跑到上海去拉黃包車總比這里好一點吧！省得每天吃煤屑。」</p>
<p>小金的話更使阿成傷心起來，他知道自己已經是沒有別種生活的方法了，小金他們可以拉黃包車，他們還是年靑，可是他，已經把他的靑春的力，他的活命的血，都給那為着每天五毛錢的生活費斷喪在二十年來的工作里去了。兩個月的工資，也不過是三十塊錢，這一點點錢，將如何生活下去呢？想到返里，他的心又從悲傷變成憤怒了，他不再怨他的命運，也不怨他年老無能、，他只有怨恨着那吸去了他的血的工作，那享受着他二十年來工作的大部份代價的人。他自己知道，他的被裁，是因為他已經不是會生產的一部內的機器了。</p>

<p>老妻在年輕的時候，雖然也非常恨着自己的丈夫。不顧妻子的生活。只顧自己享樂：但，年紀一老，心也就軟弱下來。她見釗丈夫衰老而襤褸地回來，可憐得落下淚來了。决子和女兒倆的腦海裏，父親給他倆的影響根本是非常模糊的；父親的回來見到媽很對他和睦，自然也就跟着有點兒快活。</p>
<p>可是因為小時候沒有父親而吃盡苦頭的長子，現在的家庭全由他辛辛苦苦地撑　起來的。他記起從前父親走後的過着悲苦的日子，目下又看到父親回來想吃現成飯，可有點兒不願意。</p>
<p>於是否認子他的父親有進自己家門來的權利，不！那是因為父親根本沒有盡到本身的責任。</p>

<h3>Ikeda Returned to Tianjin Yesterday; Tashiro Convened Staff Meeting; Ikeda Reported on His Return Trip; Economic Development Fund Issues; Both Sides Are Still Studying</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Staff Officer Ikeda returned to Tianjin by military plane from Dalian at noon on the 8th and immediately went to Zhang Yuan's official residence to report to Tashiro. At 2:00 PM, Tashiro convened a meeting of over 30 close aides, including Hashimoto, Matsumuro, Iida, Kazuichi, and Sentada, at the official residence to listen to Ikeda's report and convey the central leadership's opinions on the economic development of North China. Subsequently, discussions began and lasted until 6:00 PM. Tashiro will attend Song's banquet invitation on the 9th, accompanied by Ikeda, for concrete negotiations. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan provided a written response to reporters' questions on the 8th: 1. He will return to Beiping in three to five days. 2. His meetings with Tashiro and Horiuchi in Tianjin were merely courtesy visits and did not involve any discussion of issues. 3. Li Sihao was originally scheduled to return north around the 10th, but due to the death of Duan's elder brother, there may be a delay of several days. 4. The issue of economic development funds is still under study, and concrete measures will be announced when available. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the North China issue, Song recently continued discussions with Tashiro and Japanese Consul Horiuchi in Tianjin. There were also brief discussions on issues such as troop stationing and local security. Song is scheduled to return to Beiping around the middle of the month. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the economic development of North China, the Japanese military, due to its inability to raise cash, plans to stabilize the political situation to attract Chinese cooperation and reap mutual benefits. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Ikeda, a staff officer of the Japanese Garrison Army, returned to Tianjin by plane from Dalian at noon on the 8th. In the afternoon, he went to the official residence of Japanese Commander Tashiro in Zhang Yuan to report on the progress of his negotiations in Japan. After listening to the report, Tashiro immediately convened a meeting of key military staff. Ikeda first described his meetings with financial magnates in Tokyo and conveyed the intentions of the central government. It was decided that Hashimoto, Kazuichi, and others present would speak in succession and exchange opinions. The meeting lasted for quite some time before adjourning. According to Japanese sources, Ikeda's negotiations in Japan were quite successful, and many Japanese financial groups are willing to invest in North China. (8th Central Press)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hashimoto and Kazuichi are scheduled to fly to Qingdao at 9:00 AM on the 9th to first meet with Hasegawa, the chief of the Qingdao Special Service Agency. On the 10th, they will visit various Chinese and Japanese dignitaries in Qingdao. They will take a night train to Jinan on the 11th and visit Han in the morning. They will fly back on the 12th.

<p>(Beiping) Due to the increasingly tense activities of the "Manchu" and Mongolian troops in Chahar Province and northern Suiyuan, the Suiyuan authorities have stepped up preparations to resist. Senior Chinese officials and Mongolian leaders loyal to the central government met with Fu Zuoyi yesterday in Guihua, the provincial capital, and expressed their support for adopting a strong defensive policy.

It is said that yesterday several hundred Mongolian mercenary troops attacked the Suiyuan army defense line in Taolin and Xinhe counties, but were defeated. There were no casualties on either side. At the same time, 1,000 Mongolian soldiers from the "Manchu" and Mongolian troops who occupied Bailingmiao eight months ago have been sent to reinforce them, so some people believe that the "Manchu" and Mongolian troops may have a plan to invade the northern border defense line of Suiyuan. This defense line is located about sixty miles south of Bailingmiao, at the northern end of the Chinese residential area and the dividing line at the southern end of the Mongolian plains. The Suiyuan authorities were not worried about changes in this line north and the Bailingmiao area, but since the arrival of the reinforcements of the Mongolian army, it has caused considerable concern, because if the Mongolian army attacks from this road, it may affect the flanks of the eastern Suiyuan garrison.

<h3>Japanese Rissho Kosei-kai: Undermining Morality, Sex Scandals Continue to be Discovered, Authorities Determined to Crack Down Strictly</h3>
<p>Osaka: After the discovery of Rissho Kosei-kai's founder, Miki Tokuichi's, assault on a young girl, the authorities' attitude towards the sect is extremely severe. Since Miki Tokuichi was apprehended on September 28th, various secrets within the sacred temple, as well as embezzlement cases involving sect executives and sex scandals, have been continuously uncovered, providing various topics for society. As a result of the Osaka Prosecutor's Office's headquarters meeting, it was decided to send personnel to Tokyo within days, carrying various materials, to provide detailed reports to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Education. The government authorities will base their decisions on these reports and decide on a decisive policy towards Rissho Kosei-kai. It is rumored that mid-December will be "the last day for the evil cult". (Eighth Day Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Kanazawa: The head of the Rissho Kosei-kai's Kanazawa branch, Fujizuka Jiro, was apprehended by the authorities on the 2nd of this month. As a result of the prosecutor's office's interrogation, it was confirmed that his medical-like activities implemented since Showa 8 (1933) definitely involved fraudulent behavior. The authorities ordered the dissolution of the Rissho Kosei-kai's Kanazawa branch. (Eighth Day Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Osaka: The already disintegrated Rissho Kosei-kai is now doing its utmost to prevent and reduce the number of believers. According to recent propaganda efforts in its organ, the former leader will soon return with a clean slate, but even if he cannot return, this incident should be regarded as a personal act and has nothing to do with the sect itself. The headquarters has also issued the following instructions to each branch:</p>
<p>What has been published in various newspapers and magazines is completely a misunderstanding and should be vigorously publicized to believers and the general public.</p>
<p>Also, in order to avoid the resentment of right-wing groups, followers are encouraged to raise their national flags and sing their national anthem. The sect's executives believe that since the first leader has been apprehended, the sect should center around Miki Tokuichi's son, Miki Tokuchika, so that it does not violate the law, especially since it has absolutely no relation to the sect's fate. However, the prosecutor's office has already obtained considerable clues and fears that it will not accommodate the hopes of the sect's executives. The sect has recently pretended to have the support of the military, but the prosecutor's office and the military have both not made any statements. Therefore, the sect's final period should not be far away. (Eighth Day Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Ningxia Correspondence</p>
<h3>Ningxia Sketches</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi Wu</p>
<p>The Plight of Farmers</p>
<p>I recently traveled through various counties in Ningxia for two weeks. The deepest impression I got was the plight of the farmers. The average farmer simply "has no grain to last overnight." This is not because Ningxia only has nine county administrations, plus Dengkou County, which is just an empty government office (the land rights of Dengkou County belong to Alashan Banner, which used to be an establishment bureau), so the financial resources are insufficient, and land taxes have to be increased. Nor is it because cultivated land in Ningxia accounts for only ten percent of the total area, so production is not enough for consumption. Ningxia's finances actually have an income of seven million yuan per year, which should be more than enough to cover the province's military and administrative expenses. Ningxia's land, with the benefit of Yellow River water conservancy, is known for being fertile, so it should not make the farmers so poor. I think the reason for this is best known to the officials in Ningxia.</p>
<p>To illustrate the plight of Ningxia's farmers, I can give an example of something I personally witnessed. One day, I was on my way to Wang Hong Fort (seventy li from Ningyuan, belonging to Ningsuo County) and encountered a farmer returning from the county government, wailing in grief. When asked why, the man sobbed and said: "We can't live! In these times, ordinary people can't live!" He could not speak any further. After detailed inquiry, I learned that the man's surname was Wang, he lived in the fourth district of the county, and he cultivated ten mu of land. He had to pay twenty-five yuan in land tax (each mu of land tax is valued at two yuan and five jiao), nine jiao in surcharges, one yuan in conscription fees, one yuan and five jiao in water conservancy fees, and eighty yuan in poppy tax (even if you don't grow opium, you still have to pay the tax), totaling—a burden of one hundred and eleven yuan in official taxes per mu per year, an average of eleven yuan in annual donations per mu. If the harvest is good, he can harvest eight shi of wheat, worth about ninety-six yuan, which is barely enough to cover expenses. If he grows poppies, he can harvest six hundred taels, worth about one hundred and fifty yuan, which is enough to pay official taxes. Unfortunately, the villages in the fourth district of Ningsuo County had a hailstorm on August 24th of this year, and the autumn wheat was hit hard, making the harvest hopeless. This year's poppy seedlings were also not good, and each mu only yielded more than twenty taels. The government collected them in July, paying them off at one yuan and six taels (the market price is four taels per yuan) to offset taxes. There is no grain left in the house, and the five family members, old and young, are crying for food. (The county government should have reported these disaster areas to the provincial government and exempted them from autumn grain.) But the government actually arrested him for delaying the autumn grain payment and used torture to force him to pay. This tragedy was encountered by the reporter by chance, and similar cases of oppressive government in other counties are common hearsay. According to the reporter's knowledge, the number of runaway households in each county is now more than 700 in Pingluo, 250 in Jinji, and more than 400 in Zhongwei (other counties are unknown). Pingluo has the most runaway households, but the income of each county's treasury is also best in Pingluo. In September of last year, Ningsuo County Magistrate Mou Fengming committed suicide by jumping into the Yellow River because he could not bear to treat the people harshly and was not effective in urging them to pay taxes, which was condemned by his superiors. At the same time, the tax money owed to the treasury was too much, and the poor fellow (52 years old) could not hand over the account, and he felt sorry for the people's poverty, so he had no choice but to jump into the Yellow River and die! Later, Chairman Ma held a memorial service for him and gave his family 2,000 yuan in condolences, which can be regarded as a way to comfort the loyal soul.</p>
<p>I have been to many villages in Ningxia. Every time I step into a farmer's house, the host greets me, offers me a seat and tea (only wealthy families can afford to drink tea, and most people drink cold water, and the seats are all earthen pits). The first sound is always "Ah!" or "Alas!" followed by complaints, and finally, their faces are full of worry, as if the arrival of someone wearing a long gown and uniform is not a good omen. As for the "pits without mats, and the clothes of women and children not covering their bodies," it goes without saying. Most farmers can only eat two meals of noodle paste a day (a thin porridge-like food made by mixing green vegetables and tender grass with flour), and being beaten by the bailiffs of the county officials (a wooden whip used to ride horses and mules, two feet long and about one and a half inches in diameter, which the bailiffs often use to beat the people, they have a saying: "The people of Ningxia, a hundred good words are not as good as a beating with a horse whip." The rampage of the bailiffs can be seen from this). As the saying goes: "The Yellow River enriches Ningxia," but now it has become like this. How could we have expected it?</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Ningxia and Alashan Banner</p>
<p>Of Ningxia Province's total area of 911.612 square li, north of the Helan Mountains, the edge of the Mongolian Plateau, all belong to the jurisdiction of the Alashan Banner, accounting for approximately 30% of the total area. The Ejin Banner in the west also accounts for approximately 20% of the total area (most of the land is sandy grassland, with salt ponds and camel tolls, grass head taxes, etc., as the only income. The business route from Baotou to Gansu and Xinjiang passes through the A Banner, so the banner's annual grass head tax income is as high as two million yuan). Cultivated land only accounts for approximately 5% of the total area. The Alashan Banner is also known as the Western Seto Grassland. The first town is called Dingyuan Camp. Now, the Zihu Establishment Bureau is set up. The Wangfu is located at the foot of the western Helan Mountains. Darijaya, the Prince of the A Banner, is stationed here, which is the only commercial area in Western Mongolia. Prince Da holds the hereditary title of Jasagh and has marital ties with the former Qing Palace. He often resides in Beiping and manages banner affairs remotely. He rarely has contact with the eight banners of Chahar in Eastern Mongolia, as well as the Ulanqab and Ikezhao leagues in Suiyuan and Mongolia. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, when the Ningxia Provincial Government was reorganized, Prince Da took office as a member of the provincial government and came to Ningxia several times to attend provincial affairs meetings, where he repeatedly discussed the promotion of education and construction in A Banner. In the 22nd year, the provincial government set up a tax card at Baiyi Makan, an A Banner site 120 li north of Dengkou County, to intercept eastern camel road tax money. The Dengkou Establishment Bureau was changed to a county, and heavy taxes were levied on Mongolian salt passing through the A Banner, which aroused Prince Da's dissatisfaction. The two sides disputed each other, and although the central authorities mediated, no concrete solution was found.</p>
<p>There are only more than 2,000 Han households in the entire Dengkou County, but 850 households have been registered as Mongolian citizens in the Alashan Banner. Why do Han people want to become citizens? There are two reasons: (1) Han people who become Mongolian citizens and cultivate banner land only have to pay some grass head tax each year to obtain a comfortable life. (2) Han people's cultivation of land must be cleared, measured, registered, and taxed by the county government before they are allowed to cultivate, and they must also pay unlimited donations to the county government every year. The territory of Dengkou County was all wasteland a dozen years ago. Farmers who had no land or were fleeing famine used their sweat and blood to cultivate it, and they have now achieved a life of hardship and sweetness. They gradually saw the benefits of turning wasteland into arable land. The county government insisted on raising taxes on them, how could they be willing? But how can powerless old people live a life of no government? So, most of them joined the Mongolian banner nearby, and their purpose was nothing more than to avoid the heavy burden imposed by the county government and seek their own way of survival. But Dengkou County was established. How can a county government without people become a government? So, they forced the farmers to register, hoping to achieve the goal of building a county. But on the other hand, Prince Da of the Alashan Banner was unwilling to let go of the 800-odd existing farm households that paid the grass head tax to the Dengkou County government. Moreover, according to the border line between China and Mongolia, most of the territory of Alashan Banner's Dengkou County is also within it. This account has not been cleared up to this day. Last year, Tang Kesan of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission was sent to mediate, but it was only to seek harmony in the feelings of both sides. The problem itself of the Dengkou County border event has not been specifically resolved.</p>
<p>There is now a car road from the provincial capital of Ningxia to the Alashan Banner's Prince Da's residence, which can be reached in about six hours. The location of the Alashan Banner is very important. According to recent news, the Japanese are building hangars within the Alashan Banner and have sent a large number of ronin to disrupt the Longxi Gan (Zhangye) and Liang (Pingfan) areas of Gansu Province. Like mercury seeping into the ground, they are taking advantage of every opportunity. What is the intention? Clear-sighted people should be able to see through it. We deeply believe that the Ningxia authorities will be able to uphold their usual confidence, consolidate the anti-communist front, and refuse certain parties to operate in Ningxia. However, Ningxia Province does not have good feelings with A Banner, and it is not easy to contact and resist foreign enemies for a while. If A Banner is unfortunately reduced to a source of harassment in the northwest by a certain party, Ningxia Province will bear the brunt of it and will be overwhelmed by troubles.</p>
<p>Beiping Special Letter</p>
<h3>Cultural Circles in Beiping Mourn Lu Xun</h3>
<p>The news of the death of Lu Xun, a giant of our literary world and a pioneer of thought, spread to this area from Shanghai on the 19th of last month. That night, the various evening newspapers here published it in the most prominent position on the first page with a three-character headline. Whether they supported him or did not know him, all expressed their condolences. Tracing his life, he lived in the old capital for fifteen years from the first year of the Republic of China to the fifteenth year of the Republic of China. And the short story collections, "Nahan" and "Panghuang", which shocked the world at the time, were also produced during this period. In terms of thought, he fought with the then-fashionable "gentleman" faction in the old capital. As a result, he offended the authorities and was wanted, and he fled to Guangdong. From the fifteenth year to the present, for these ten years, although his footsteps were all in the south, the people in the cultural circles here, as well as the young students, paid very close attention to his every word and deed. It can be seen from the enthusiastic welcome of the young students when he returned to the old capital to visit his mother in the winter of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, how the people in the old capital saw him. After the "12.9" and "12.16" demonstrations and parades last year, the student movement flourished for a time. For the past ten months, issues such as "saving the country," "new writing movement," and "national defense literature" have been the focus of young justice. And his discussions on issues such as "united front" and "national defense literature" were especially the objects of attention of the young students here; they were often cited during discussions. His prestige was unmatched. Although the publications containing his remarks often could not be sold here due to environmental reasons, there were many people who tried every possible means to buy them. From the above, it can be seen the depth of his relationship with the cultural circles in the old capital.</p>
<p>When the news of his death first spread to this area, all parties were emotionally agitated, and the reactions were extremely inconsistent. Some were sad, some were grieving. Some praised his life, and some lamented his loss. Precisely because the performances were different, misunderstandings often arose between the different parties, and at the extreme, they slandered each other. In fact, there was no difference in essence. After two weeks, the above-mentioned differences have gradually decreased. The agitation of emotions has gradually been replaced by reason. All parties have a consistent attitude towards his life. There are about the following points.</p>
<p>(1) Actual capacity and resentment—During his lifetime, due to the relationship of his thoughts, he often did not hesitate to add the most venomous criticism to others in his fierce writing style. And the recipients were often his close friends. In fact, his way of being a person contained great enthusiasm in the cold. Anyone who had dealings with him could say this. As for ideological criticism, and private friendship, they were not related at all. Outsiders did not observe, thinking that all those who had been criticized by him mostly harbored antipathy towards him. There were many people in Beiping who had had verbal disputes with him. Therefore, when Lu Xun's death was first heard, the attitude of these people was the object of attention of the general public. However, in the past two weeks, these people have expressed their opinions one after another, and the consistent point is that they are all saddened and regretful. They all value the friendship between them and him during his lifetime. Although he had in his will, which he drafted before his death, the clause "Those who harm other people's teeth and eyes but oppose retaliation and advocate tolerance must not be approached." It seems that a reporter used this to ask his friends during his lifetime about the results, and the answer was, "This is based on general arguments, I have had nearly twenty years of friendship with Lu Xun, and I know very well that his usual way of being a person is not so strict."</p>
<p>(2) The "Transformation" Issue——In the second and third years after the 16th year of the Republic of China, Lu Xun had a war of words with the Creation Society and the Sun Society, who were then progressive figures, due to the issue of his creative attitude. Later, around the 18th year of the Republic of China, his attitude changed, and the Left-Wing Writers League was established, and progressive literati joined one after another. When the declaration was published, the first name signed was Lu Xun. Since then, he has consistently expressed his opinions from a socialist perspective. In the literary world, the change in his attitude during this period is called a transformation. It means that his humanitarian stance has turned to a socialist stance. Now that the coffin is closed, this point is the most noticed by the general public here, and the speeches published by all parties are mostly in this regard. As of now, although the date of the final conclusion has not yet been reached: but observing the general trend, it is recognized that the change in attitude in the 18th year of the Republic of China is still a consistent progress, which has already gained the upper hand. Those who are familiar with his life all say that his creative attitude has always been consistent: but it is only because the environment is different that he has changed his method. Fundamentally, he is progressing and consistent, not transformed. His friend during his lifetime, Ma Yuzao, a teacher in the Department of Chinese Literature at Peking University, has repeatedly emphasized this point, and he has expressed infinite indignation at a group of people who try to use this "transformation" to achieve personal goals.</p>
<p>(3) Lu Xun and Gorky——After his death, the loss to China was generally compared to the loss of Gorky in the Soviet literary world this year. However, most of the people in the cultural circles of the old capital believed that Lu Xun's death at this time was a greater loss to the Chinese literary world than the loss of a Gorky in the Soviet Union at this time. The reasons are: (1) The Soviet Union's bright society has been realized, and writers who fight against darkness are not as important as those who praise bright society. This is absolutely not the case in China. (2) Although Gorky has passed away, the literary world, like bamboo shoots after a rain, is flourishing. The center of gravity of the literary world will not be lost. If China loses a Lu Xun, the center of gravity of the literary world will have a shaken image. Therefore, the loss can be said to be extraordinarily heavy. (3) Gorky is a pure writer. He has something to rely on in terms of thought. China is currently a chaotic society. He is a writer and thinker. After his death, young people not only lost a model in literature, but also lost an important mentor in thought. Summarizing the opinions of all parties, the above three points seem to have been generally recognized.</p>
<p>(3) The attitude of his younger brother, Zhou Zuoren——Due to different personalities, there have been rumors of discord between him and his brothers before Lu Xun's death. After Lu Xun's death, the first person here to receive the news was Zhou Zuoren, who received a telegram from their third brother, Zhou Jianren. Until the newspapers announced the news to society, Zhou Zuoren's attitude, although it was a matter within their family, was also paid great attention by people in society because they were both writers. Later, Zhou Zuoren could not go south because his mother needed someone to take care of her. Therefore, the outside world's speculation became even more divided. It was not until the memorial service for Lu Xun held by Peking University that he had the opportunity to describe in detail the relationship between him and his brothers. After that, society had a clear understanding. Roughly speaking, their ideas and literary views are very different; but their feelings are certainly not as bad as the outside world has rumored. The former can be known from the fact that Zhou Zuoren repeatedly stated at the memorial service that he did not understand Lu Xun's thoughts after the 15th year of the Republic of China, and that he praised Lu Xun's works on archaeology and history, but omitted his novels and miscellaneous essays, etc. The latter can be known from the sad situation at the memorial service. But summing up his attitude, it seems that his reply at the memorial service can summarize everything. The general idea is: "If you are in the position of a family member, a little praise will be laughed at; if you suppress it, it will easily provoke people's antipathy, so it is very difficult," and so on.</p>
<p>As of now, various newspapers here have published memorial pages one after another. Various schools have also held memorial meetings one after another. It is said that the literary and art groups will jointly hold a large-scale memorial meeting in the near future. As for the complete works of Lu Xun, it is said that his friends here are already working on editing them. Zhou Zuoren once said to people: If the editing of the complete works requires Lu Xun's life story, he and his younger brother Zhou Jianren will provide as much information as possible.</p>

<p>Current Events Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Stabilize Prices</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>In recent years, prices have been rising continuously. Business operators in industry and commerce are generally pleased, and farmers in various regions seem to have recovered somewhat from the abundant harvests. However, considering the bans on grain exports in various provinces, it is evident that even with a bumper harvest, it is still insufficient to meet local demand. Observing the significant fluctuations in prices of Shanghai flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton, the so-called rise in prices is actually a manifestation of instability. According to recent reports, some are seeking wage increases due to rising prices, and others are engaging in fights due to labor disputes. Although these incidents may seem minor, if appropriate remedies are not sought early, future hidden dangers are to be feared.</p>
<p>We believe that prices and currency value are mutually causal. Under the current monetary system, there must be a standard for comparison. This standard should be found in a local price index. Various disputes in the business community should be resolved according to this standard. While prices may not be entirely stable, this standard can reduce disruptive factors such as speculation and manipulation, ensuring that price fluctuations are regularized.</p>
<p>Currently, price fluctuations are either affected by the political situation or influenced by rumors. Speculation and manipulation often arise from these factors. However, the impact of the political situation is temporary, while rumors are endless. Recently, unfounded rumors about currency have persisted in the market. It is unclear whether, after reforming the monetary system, the financial authorities have repeatedly stated officially that the current system of issuing banknotes maintains adequate reserves, to inform the people. The emergence of rumors indicates that they serve another purpose.</p>
<p>We believe that what the authorities should urgently address today includes: (1) maintaining the soundness of the monetary system to stabilize prices; (2) strictly cracking down on raising prices and seeking exorbitant profits, and supervising transactions in the speculative market; (3) earnestly planning for the stability and improvement of general living conditions; (4) adopting practical and effective measures to prevent adverse consequences caused by rising prices; and (5) finding ways to concentrate capital and utilize it in productive enterprises, and identifying the reasons why those with capital have not fully invested and those with skills have not contributed their efforts, in order to achieve genuine economic recovery. These are the major issues that the people urgently desire. Therefore, we briefly mention them.</p>
<h3>The Western Government Moves to the Eastern Coast, Determined to Continue the War of Resistance; Major Economic Resources Remain in Their Control; The Gain or Loss of the Capital Region is of No Strategic Importance</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Spanish Embassy in France recently issued a statement, saying, "The Spanish government's move to Valencia is due to economic and political reasons. From the geographical location of Valencia, it is most appropriate to use it as a center to command the national army and continue to fight against the rebels. The government is determined to continue the war of resistance until the final victory is achieved. And the government will eventually win, because the public opinion of democratic countries will eventually believe that the Spanish government is justified, and the agreement not to interfere in the Spanish civil war will be cancelled. This non-interference agreement, though seemingly proper, in fact benefits the rebels and only prevents the government from defending itself. The government now has all of the national treasury reserves, which the rebels cannot seize. Moreover, Spain's major economic resources are still occupied by the government forces. And the major industrial cities in the provinces of Biscay, Santander, Asturias, Catalonia, Zaragoza, and the Mediterranean region are still in the hands of the government. The government now has the solidarity of the working class as its backing, and the support of informed people in the international community. And all informed people know that the victory of the Spanish Republic is actually the failure of aggressive international fascism, which will strengthen the forces of peace in Europe. Therefore, the fate of Madrid is only a temporary gain or loss, which is not enough to determine the final outcome of the Spanish civil war. Moreover, from a military point of view, the gain or loss of Madrid is also of no strategic importance. From the past history of the Spanish civil war, those who control the coastal areas will definitely win the final victory. Now the coastal areas are still in the hands of the government. In short, the real war is just beginning. Recalling the Great War in 1914, when the German army approached Paris, the French government temporarily moved to Bordeaux on the Atlantic coast to continue fighting, and finally turned the tide and turned defeat into victory. The Spanish government has also decided to emulate the strategy of the French government at that time and adopt a strategy of outer encirclement until the final victory is achieved."

(Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid Judging from the situation at noon today, the advance of the Nationalist forces on all fronts seems to have been slightly hampered. Last night, elite reinforcements from the government army arrived and fought bravely. It is reported that they have repelled the Nationalist forces to Carabanchel, a few miles south of Madrid. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid According to the announcement issued by the Governor of Madrid this morning, the government army has won victories in Huesca and Malaga, and has repelled the enemy on the fronts south and southwest of Madrid. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Fighting in the Center of Madrid; The Rebel Army Wins by Surprise; All Suburbs are Occupied</h3>
<p>(London) After a column of Nationalist forces led by Colonel Asensio entered Madrid, fierce street fighting has broken out in the streets. After the government militia collapsed in the suburbs of the Western capital, they regrouped in the center of the capital and are currently holding their ground. It is reported that they have even repelled the attacking Nationalist forces several times. The Nationalist forces launched the final general offensive on Madrid at 8 o'clock yesterday morning. Beforehand, they were heavily bombarded by artillery. The government army artillery in the city center also returned fire. Under the command of General Varela, a young general with the most military knowledge in Spain, the Nationalist forces advanced like a hot knife through butter in the freezing weather and occupied all the suburbs of the Western capital. The militia was disheartened, probably due to the departure of the Prime Minister and other government officials. After making several counterattacks, they abandoned many dead and wounded and a large number of unused munitions in the suburban positions and retreated to the center of the capital. The order of the militia has been completely disrupted. According to the description of a Portuguese journalist, the militia abandoned Russian-made tanks in the rear instead of placing them at the front. The outer suburbs of Madrid were completely occupied by the Nationalist forces this morning. The Seville Nationalist Radio Station broadcast, "Madrid can now be considered to belong to us." It is heard that a part of the militia is now planning to flee from the capital. At the same time, there was a wireless message intercepted en route from Madrid to Barcelona, ​​stating that the "citizen guard" of the capital had risen up against the government. The radio broadcast also said that members of extreme factions in the Western capital attacked the German Embassy, ​​causing its staff and those who had taken refuge there to have to leave. When the war approached Madrid, the situation in the capital was extremely miserable. Many women and children gathered in front of the British Embassy, ​​requesting protection. However, because there were still 200 British expatriates in the Western capital who needed to take refuge in the embassy, ​​these women and children had to be sent away with kind words. Yesterday, the goal of the Nationalist forces was not to occupy the entire city, but only to seize important locations so that they could advance to the center of the capital from there. It is reported that after the Nationalist forces destroyed the government army's forward defense works with artillery fire for about two hours, they began to advance with African infantry as the vanguard, assisted by a hundred tanks and many armored vehicles. The Nationalist forces admitted that due to the bad weather, their air force did not make much contribution, while the government army's planes were quite effective in attacking the advancing columns, and lowered their altitude from the thick clouds to attempt to bomb the Ligones area where General Varela's headquarters was located. London suddenly received news from Lisbon that General Varela's troops had reached the important street of Madrid, the Puerta del Sol, where street fighting was fierce, because the government offices were all located on that street. It is said that the Nationalist troops did not reach the streets of the capital until 10:40 a.m. The Spanish Embassy in London issued a statement last night, saying that the center of the Western capital was as peaceful as usual, and the radio station was still engaged in broadcasting work as usual. The only difference from usual was that there were only three people serving instead of ten in the past, because all the healthy men had been transferred to the front line. The Spanish Embassy further stated that the people of Madrid are still earnestly preparing to defend the city, and are determined to perish with the city. After they received the news that the Nationalist forces had been repelled to Carabanchel, their confidence increased. It is heard that the government army is currently using heavy artillery to bombard the Nationalist forces in Lignes. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Government Troops Attacked on Both Sides; Finally Unable to Hold Out and Retreat</h3>
<p>Canary Islands The radio station here in the city of Tenerife recently broadcast a detailed account of the Nationalist forces' entry into Madrid yesterday, saying that the government army initially thought that the Nationalist forces would definitely enter the capital from the south. Who knew that Colonel Yague of the Nationalist forces would win by surprise and adopt a flanking action from the northwest to spy on the capital. They immediately occupied several houses. At the same time, another column of Nationalist forces attacked from the southwest and immediately occupied the nearby village of Vargas. The government army was attacked on both sides and was unable to hold out. It is heard that when the militia belonging to the government army withdrew from the capital, they destroyed all public buildings, especially the old palace, the telephone bureau, and most of the banks. As for the Nationalist forces, before entering the city, they sent several planes to fly over the capital and drop leaflets, advising the soldiers and civilians to take temporary refuge in the neutral zone set up in the northern part of the capital. The Nationalist forces' planes will never bomb the area unless it is absolutely necessary. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Near the town of Leganés, a reporter from our agency recently learned the situation of the battle near Madrid yesterday afternoon as follows: The capital has been surrounded by the Nationalist forces from the northwest to the village of Villegas in the southeast. The "Princesa" and "Toledo" bridges over the Manzanares River outside the south gate were occupied after being heavily bombarded by the Nationalist forces of Colonel Dela and Colonel Baron. At the same time, Colonels Castrejón and Asensio, with tanks as cover, bypassed to the northwest and attacked the rear of the capital. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid After the government army and the rebel army fought fiercely in the southern suburbs of the capital last night, the rebel army gradually approached the capital from 7:00 a.m. this morning, and successively occupied the bridges over the Manzanares River outside the city. The government army resisted bravely, and retreated after two hours of fierce fighting. The rebel army finally attacked the city at 1:00 p.m. This morning's battle was the fiercest in the towns of Carabanchel and Villaverde. It is rumored that the government army repelled the rebel army by two kilometers in the Carabanchel area, but this statement has not been confirmed. In Madrid City, the sound of artillery fire was constant today. Many shells fired by the rebel army landed in the city, and many of them hit the densely populated Lavapies district. Many houses have been destroyed, and there have been repeated deaths and injuries. At the same time, the government army also fired artillery at the rebel army outside the city. Residents in the city, fearing that their houses would collapse, mostly hid in the open air. Today, the rebel army's planes did not appear in the sky, but eight planes of the government army took off and soared for a long time. At that time, there was a strong wind, and the sound of artillery fire was often masked by the sound of the wind. There were few pedestrians on the streets of the city, and cars were rare, but the trams still ran as usual until the afternoon. Most of the shops have been closed, and many shop assistants have been transferred to the front line to fight in a few hours. The militia fought bravely in the trenches outside the city, using the city walls as cover. It is said that they captured 400 Moroccan soldiers belonging to the rebel army. Residents who fled to the outside of the city were constantly on their way, either walking with bags on their backs, or carrying boxes and cages in hand carts. Most of them were silent. Those who could not bear to abandon their homes and leave were mostly in groups on the streets, facing each other silently. Next to them were piles of all kinds of livestock, furniture, clothing, and so on. But in general, the residents were still able to deal with it calmly. When our reporter telegraphed in the evening, the sound of artillery fire continued unabated. It was not easy to distinguish where the rebel army was firing from. Most of the rebel army should still be near the towns of Carabanchel and Villaverde in the south of the city. Although a part of the troops may have attacked the city in the afternoon, the rebel army will not occupy the entire city tonight. So far, the government and the people are still making a final resistance and have not expressed complete despair. (Havas dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<h3>The Capital is Dark All Night; The Residents are in a Panic</h3>
<p>(London) The Sunday Express recently published an extra edition, saying that this newspaper had a long-distance telephone conversation with Forbes, the British chargé d'affaires in Spain, this morning. He said, "Everything is as usual in the embassy." There are more than 200 British expatriates here, half of whom are women. They are all taking refuge in the embassy, ​​and there is nothing to panic about at the moment. If General Franco does enter the city, we will still stay here to observe the situation. Madrid was dark and unlit all night last night. The situation is calm this morning, which may be a bad sign. The government army and the Nationalist army are now fighting three miles from the city. We are in the city post office, and the artillery fire outside the city is clearly visible. Although the Nationalist army planes flew to the capital to drop bombs during the day, none of them hit near our embassy. Even if the embassy area is affected, the loss will not be great. From our embassy, ​​we did not see any trenches, but the movement of tanks and troops on both sides was clearly visible. (Havas dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>Madrid The residents of the capital were anxious all night and could not fall asleep, waiting for dawn, fearing that the Nationalist army would start bombarding again at that time. The general residents also believed that if the Nationalist army crossed the Manzanares bridges, a fierce street fight would be inevitable. Last night, the official radio station broadcasted all night, announcing the names and shapes of thousands of children who had gone missing during the street fighting in the suburbs of the capital yesterday, in order to find them. In the evening, the Nationalist army planes dropped many leaflets in the capital, announcing that they would launch a general offensive on the Western capital today, and warning women and children and people who did not participate in the war to leave the war zone immediately.

<h3>The Western Government Organizes a National Defense Committee to be stationed in Madrid to Handle the Affairs of Staying Behind</h3>

<h3>The Spanish Right-Wing Government is Expected to be First Recognized by Italy and Germany; Britain and France Maintain Close Liaison, Still Adhering to the Doctrine of Non-Recognition</h3>
<p>(Berlin) According to German newspapers, if General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, announces the establishment of a new Spanish government in Madrid, Germany will immediately recognize it. However, according to an official spokesperson, Germany does not want to recognize it until the new government rules the entire country. It is widely believed that Italy will recognize the new Nationalist government as soon as it effectively controls Madrid, but it has not yet formally expressed this intention. It is expected that Britain and France will have to wait until the new government holds elections in accordance with the constitution before they can recognize it. (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news announced by the Spanish Embassy in France, although the Spanish government has moved to the city of Valencia, according to a telegram sent from that city by Spanish Foreign Minister Talva Yuto, the rebels do not seem to have captured the city of Madrid. According to responsible sources, even if the city of Madrid has been occupied by the rebels, the French government will not recognize the Nationalist government. The governments of Britain and France are currently maintaining close contact regarding the situation in Spain. The two governments hold the same attitude, that is, all actions regarding the Spanish issue should be negotiated and then issued by the two governments. As for the French Ambassador to Spain, Heberde, and all the members of the diplomatic corps in Spain, they are currently staying temporarily in France. If the rebels occupy the capital, the French Consul in Madrid, Neuville, will be ordered to be responsible for protecting the interests of the French expatriates there, which is the same as in the cities of Seville and Burgos that have already been occupied by the rebels. If the Spanish Prime Minister, Caballero, establishes a government in the city of Valencia, the French interests there will still be the responsibility of the French Consul originally stationed in the city of Valencia.

<p>(Rome) The famous reporter Gaida recently commented on the situation in Spain in the "Italian Daily Newspaper," saying, "The Nationalist government of that country should be recognized by the most rational government of a certain country in Europe. This government is most representative of the country's nation. Without holding a referendum or going through other tests, it is already known to be a legitimate government. Moreover, four-fifths of the land in Spain has been occupied by the Nationalist government, and the people have flocked to it. This fact is not only of great value within the country, but also of extremely important international significance. In this case, what is the use of the committee for adjusting the non-interference method in the Spanish civil war continuing its work? Even the committee itself feels this. The Soviet Russian government wants to use Spanish land as a base to control the destiny of other countries, but it only sees its efforts exhausted and its efforts failing. The Spanish nation is unwilling to give up its mission in Western culture and has already embarked on the road to revival. How can the most rational governments of European countries turn a blind eye to this?" (Reuters dispatch on the 8th)</p>
<h3>The Italian Spanish Embassy Roof is Adorned with Red and Yellow Flags to Celebrate the Rebel Army's Victory</h3>
<p>(Rome) After the Spanish Ambassador to the Vatican, Romero, left his post and returned to his country in March, he has not yet returned here.

Until this morning, the embassy has raised the red and yellow flag (the national flag of the Spanish monarchy), with a crown embedded on it. Expensive carpets were laid on the embassy balcony railings, and candelabras were placed throughout the interior, scheduled to be lit tonight to celebrate the victory of the country's Nationalist army.

<h3>Eastern Construction of Western Country: Soviet Republic Centered on Catalonia Province - French Newspaper Believes Realization is Possible</h3>
<p>(Paris) Various newspapers have recently commented on the situation in Spain, many saying that after the fall of Madrid, the Autonomous Region of Catalonia in the east of the country may well declare a Soviet Republic. The Petit Parisien reported, "It is highly possible that a kind of Soviet Republic will be declared in eastern Spain, centered on the Autonomous Region of Catalonia. This republic should also try to get recognition from various countries, but as far as France is concerned, this attempt must be resolutely rejected." L'Echo de Paris criticized the activities of the Soviet Ambassador to Spain, Rosenburg, saying, "Rosenburg's intention is to delay and thus reduce the strength of General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, and to gain a victory in the Autonomous Region of Catalonia, and to preside over military and diplomatic activities in Barcelona, in the hope of establishing a Catalan Soviet Republic."

<h3>Germany Begins Utilizing the Waste Recycling Movement as a Feature of the Four-Year Plan</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Since the nationwide reorganization of a new agency, the "Utilization of Waste" movement, a characteristic of the Four-Year Plan, has begun to be implemented in Germany. The mission of this new agency has been detailed by General Goering in an open letter to housewives across the country. General Goering instructed the "Nourishment Department" of the National Socialist Party's welfare organization to take the necessary steps to implement the collection of household waste, making it a unified system, and then use the remaining food to feed pigs and dogs. Before being sold, pigs must be taken to specially established parks on the outskirts of cities, nourished by this remaining food, and only sold when the time is right. Waste collection will take place in every household. A trough must be placed in the cellar of each house, and all leftover food must be discarded into it. As for other waste, it should be thrown into another box. All waste will be collected by the public and transported to special parks in various cities to feed pigs and sheep. The success of this undertaking depends entirely on the cooperation of German housewives, so General Goering especially appealed to them for cooperation. (National News Agency Telegram, 7th)</p>

<p>Warsaw Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's visit to Britain is scheduled to arrive in London this afternoon. The newspapers here have recently published lengthy articles commenting on it. Morning Express reported, "The cooperative relationship between Britain and Poland will inevitably become closer as a result of this visit. The Polish Daily reported," There are many similarities between the foreign policies of Britain and Poland. The most important is that both sides express optimism about the development of the European situation. They also oppose the formation of groups of European countries, confronting each other, and harboring mutual hostility according to their own viewpoints. On the contrary, both sides are endowed with the spirit of realism." The Polish National Defense News reported, "Poland is located between Germany and Russia, and its policy is aimed at maintaining a balance of power, thus becoming an important factor in maintaining peace. This point can be recognized by Britain. As the European situation becomes increasingly tense, countries must have absolute necessity to contact each other if they take policies that can guarantee peace." The conclusion is, "Friendship is indeed not easy to obtain, but once obtained, it can be expected to last." (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>

Therefore, one of the goals of the Vienna Conference is that the signatory countries of the Italo-Austro-Hungarian protocol (i.e., Italy, Austria, and Hungary) should establish cooperative relations with the Little Entente countries. The outcome of the future is truly doubtful. As for the rapprochement between Germany and the signatory countries of the Rome Protocol, it can be greatly supported, even if that country does not join the Protocol. In addition, when the three foreign ministers discuss the issue of preventing communism in Central Europe, the issue of Hungary's rearmament must be submitted for review at the same time, etc. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Wins Election: Famous Radio Priest Stops Political Activities</h3>
<p>Detroit, USA As a result of President Roosevelt's victory in this election, the famous American "Radio Priest" Coughlin announced today that he would withdraw from political activities. The National Union for Social Justice, which he organized, will also stop political propaganda. Father Coughlin strongly supported Roosevelt in 1932. Later, due to disagreements with the New Deal on currency issues, he joined with leaders of groups such as the Townsend Pension Plan to form the Union Party, and nominated Rankin as the presidential candidate. However, Rankin received fewer than one million votes. Several years ago, when the American economy was in decline, Father Coughlin used radio broadcasts to attack the international banking community and proposed measures to alleviate poverty, and for a time he became a figure of worldwide attention. However, he was also criticized by the press and some church leaders. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) As a result of the election, formal reports have been received from 22,731 of the 121,729 polling places nationwide.

<h3>Belgian Catholic Party Seeks to Re-establish Unity, Hoping to Restore its Original Position in Politics</h3>
<p>Beijing King Leopold III delivered a speech at the centenary celebration of the establishment of the provincial councils at noon today. He mentioned the actions of the fascist Rexist Party, but did not condemn them. He said, "It is not surprising that young people express their different opinions out of temporary extremes. This is proof that young people care about national affairs and aspire to reform. This phenomenon is welcome in young people. However, if this kind of divergence in political views is deeply rooted and remains unchanged for a long time, it is not worthy of emulation." Also, according to political sources, the Flemish National Catholic Party and the Flemish National Party are currently conducting talks to form an agreement between the two parties to act together. It is reported that the Flemish National Party has already formed an alliance with the Rexist Party. If the above-mentioned negotiations are successful in the future, the long-divided Belgian Catholic Party will re-establish unity and restore its original important position in politics, while the political position of the Socialist Party will be weakened as a result, or even lead to a cabinet reshuffle. It is also unknown. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Jehol Army Opens up Chahar North, Supervising Wang Ying's Invasion of Suiyuan, Aircraft from a Certain Quarter Repeatedly Conduct Reconnaissance over Eastern Suiyuan, Military Officials from a Certain Army Also Head to the Frontlines for Deployment</h3>
<p>Zhangbei correspondence Although the bandit army of Wang Ying is responsible for the main attack on Suiyuan, its actual strength is very weak and cannot withstand a single blow from the Jin-Sui garrison. Moreover, since a certain quarter has deep suspicions about Wang Ying and also knows that Wang's strength cannot be relied upon, they have recently been gradually increasing troops westward. First, 6,000 Jehol bandit troops were transferred from the Weichang area of Jehol, and then two more regiments were continuously transferred from Jehol, gradually opening up to the Baochang and Kangbao areas near Shangdu, remotely supporting the Wang bandits. Sixteen aircraft have already gathered and parked at the Shangdu airport, ready for use. At 8:00 AM on the 4th, another six aircraft flew out from the Doron area and circled over Kangbao for a week before heading west again. They conducted reconnaissance on the eastern border of Suiyuan for a week that day and then returned to park at the Shangdu airport. According to current statistics, there are a total of twenty-two aircraft there. Wu Yating, a Jehol puppet soldier who had not been heard of in the past, has recently been suddenly re-appointed by a certain quarter and has arrived in Shangdu from Jehol, responsible for supervising the Wang bandits' invasion of Suiyuan. It has been found that Wu's troops have several hundred people. Judging from this situation, the scourge of war is not far away.</p>
<p>Each county in northern Chahar is sparsely populated, and although the harvest of food is not very abundant, it is actually better than in the interior. However, since the puppet bandits occupied the area, the number of mouths to feed has suddenly increased, so there is now also a sense of panic. A few days ago, Li Shouxin and others in Zhangbei had an order prohibiting food from leaving the territory. On the 3rd of this month, Wang Hui reiterated the previous order, strictly prohibiting food from leaving the territory. As for the grain prices in the Shangdu, Baochang, and Kangbao areas, they have soared non-stop. Recently, buckwheat and wheat have increased by about 1-2 jiao per dou. The general poor people are all crying out in misery.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the 4th, a large batch of copper and steel strips was transported from a certain place to Zhangbei, totaling eight heavy trucks. That night, they were transferred to Nanhouchian. The strips were no more than two chi long and no more than one cun thick. It is not known what they will be used for. Tanaka Ryukichi, the chief of the Second Section of a certain army, recently accompanied Kumeo Asami, the chief of the special affairs agency in Zhangbei, to inspect the deployment of fortifications in Baochang, Kangbao, Shangdu, Daqinggou (Shangyi), Nanhouchian, and other places, as well as the military appearance of the puppet bandit armies. He was dissatisfied with the organization of each army and the preparations for the rear, believing that the strength of each army was far inferior to the Suiyuan army. Before leaving, he instructed the military leaders of each puppet bandit army on all matters and spoke to the officers and soldiers of each puppet bandit army before returning to Zhangbei. Tanaka Ryukichi then left Zhangbei and went to Tianjin and Beijing. (5th)</p>
<h3>Four Foreigners Prowl around Baimao Estuary, Surveying and Drawing</h3>
<p>Taicang correspondence Last winter, the Yangzi River Conservancy Commission submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance for the allocation of funds to build the Baimao Sluice at the Baimao Estuary in Luhe Town, a county under its jurisdiction. Over the years, it has been completed. On the morning of the 6th, four people of a certain country suddenly drove a small motorboat into the estuary to spy on, survey, and draw pictures. They drove away after about two hours. Afterwards, the township head reported to the district office and immediately ordered all the sluice gates to be closed. At that time, it was high tide, and the sea water surged, causing the embankments to become flooded. Residents were panicked.</p>
<h3>Prince Shi Passed Away in the Banner: The Succession Issue Has Not Yet Been Formally Decided, and Shaqgedan'erjiabu is Temporarily Recommended as Agent</h3>
<p>Baotou correspondence Shilabu Dorji, the Zasake of the West Gong Banner, passed away in the banner on the evening of the 30th of last month due to dysentery. When the sad news spread, both Mongolian and Han people mourned extremely. Prince Shi had no children, only a wife and a concubine. The succession issue has not yet been formally decided. All the officials of the banner have publicly recommended Shaqgedan'erjiabu, the first-class Taiji, to temporarily act as Prince. Shaq is currently in Suiyuan and will return to the banner within days to take office. The funeral has not yet been held. It is planned to wait for Secretary Huo Songling, sixth-ranked official Bao'ergelin, and office director Wang Sheng, etc., to return from Baotou to preside over the funeral. Regarding security issues, Mongolian soldiers are stationed in various places to ensure that there will be no danger. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>The Course of the Illness</p>
<p>After the rebellion in the West Gong Banner in August of this year, Prince Shi hastily responded with his troops, without a moment's rest, and experienced hardship. His spirit was inevitably damaged, and his physical condition was weak, so dryness and dampness invaded him. He contracted dysentery not long after coming to Baotou after the rebellion was quelled. In late September, Prince Shi believed that the water and soil in Baotou were unsuitable, so he returned to the banner to recuperate. However, Prince Shi and his family were superstitious and relied on brewing prayers instead of trusting medicine. Therefore, after returning to the banner, he invited lamas to brew prayers repeatedly. The illness sometimes eased and sometimes worsened. In late last month, the illness suddenly worsened. The brewing prayers were ineffective, and he finally passed away on the evening of the 30th of last month, at the age of forty-three. When the sad news spread, all Mongolian and Han officials and civilians mourned in unison.</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath</p>
<p>After Prince Shi's death, most of the important officials were not in the banner. His wife is temporarily presiding over the handling of the aftermath. According to Mongolian custom, after the death of a prince, he is not placed in a coffin, but only dressed in a shroud and sits upright in a chair. Lamas are invited to set up altars and pray. After the mourning ceremony is completed, he is buried in a well-repaired stupa. Prince Shi's shroud will be purchased and sent to the banner from Baotou within days. Prince Shi's wife is proficient in both spoken and written Chinese. Therefore, when Prince Shi first passed away, she personally wrote letters to notify all parties. Huo Songling, Prince Shi's secretary, Bao'ergelin, the third-ranked official, and Wang Sheng, the director of the banner's office in Baotou, are currently all in Baotou. After the banner's car comes to Baotou within days, they will take the car back to the banner together to preside over the formal funeral.</p>
<p>The Succession Issue</p>
<p>Prince Shi ascended the throne in 1919 of the Republic of China and reigned for a total of six years. He had no children and few close relatives. After his death, he left only a wife and a concubine. The wife is twenty-three years old, and the concubine is nineteen years old. Prince Shi also has a cousin, Sanbao Guanu, who has no talent and is not qualified to assume the great position. Therefore, the succession issue has not yet been decided. Now, all the officials of the banner have publicly recommended Shaqgedan'erjiabu, the first-class Taiji of the banner, to temporarily exercise the powers of the Prince. The first-class Taiji is the most powerful person below the Prince, and is in charge of all banner affairs. Shaqgedan'erjiabu previously served as the director of the Industrial Affairs Office of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Council and is currently a member of the council. When Prince Shi was suspended from his post by the Executive Yuan some time ago, the Prince's position was acted by Shaq. Shaq is currently in Suiyuan and has been notified. He will return to the banner within days to take office. The banner has sent Shaozi Guanu, the fourth-ranked official, as a representative to depart from the banner and go to Suiyuan and Yuan to welcome his father, Shaqgedan'erjiabu, back to the banner. Shaq is quite capable and is trusted by all officials and civilians of the banner. Therefore, it is generally expected that Shaq will officially succeed to the throne in the future.</p>
<p>No Worries about Security</p>
<p>Since the rebellion was quelled, the banner's military preparations have been greatly rectified, and they have long been stationed in various places separately. Therefore, for more than a month, the unruly elements in the banner have restrained themselves and been extremely peaceful. After Prince Shi's death, the Mongolian soldiers in various places have tightened their security even more, so security can be guaranteed. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Hebei Province Begins Winter Defense, Strictly Preventing Collaboration Between Traitors and Japanese Ruffians, Ensuring Security in the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>Baoding Dispatch: The situation in North China, after a period of slight moderation, has once again become tense. In Hebei Province, the frequent activities of the Japanese army have caused panic among the people, making them as fearful as startled birds. In every county within the province, traces of Japanese ruffians can be found, and traitors and villains have been almost completely rounded up. Although local authorities have taken precise protective measures, they still fear that even the slightest gap could lead to security concerns. Moreover, with the arrival of winter, local security is of utmost importance. To consolidate local stability, the provincial government has ordered the provincial Security Command to prepare for winter defense. The Security Command has now officially issued orders to security commanders in all districts and county magistrates, starting the winter defense immediately, with a duration of four months. The Security Command has drafted detailed guidelines for maintaining security, which will be issued to all subordinates for compliance. Traitors and villains will be severely punished. To prevent them from relying on Japanese ruffians to provoke disturbances, regulations have been established that anyone who collaborates with Japanese ruffians will be placed under surveillance by local police at all times, or even arrested. Furthermore, merchants and residents have been notified to avoid any relations with Japanese ruffians, aiming to prevent any issues before they arise.</p>
<p>Li Zhe, the Police Commissioner and Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, has recently noted that in Baoding, the provincial capital, residents have had disputes with Japanese ruffians due to renting out houses. Recently, there have even been incidents of Japanese ruffians forcibly occupying civilian houses and abusing elderly women. Fearing that this trend could impact security in the provincial capital, he convened a meeting with the heads of all district sub-bureaus, deciding to adopt measures similar to those in other parts of the province to prevent relations between Japanese ruffians and local residents. The provincial capital will also implement winter defense starting from November 1, deploying a comprehensive police network, adding police posts, and deploying military police and constabulary together for patrols, paying attention to people entering and leaving the city gates, and randomly checking pedestrians and hotels. All foreigners entering the city must present their passports for inspection, and the Public Security Bureau's investigation team will provide protective surveillance to prevent any accidents. All residents of the provincial capital must comply with the police and constabulary's random inspections and inquiries during the winter defense period. District sub-bureaus, in conjunction with street district offices, will re-verify household registrations. Therefore, the security of the provincial capital can be guaranteed. (7th)</p>
<h3>The Bandit Problem on the Borders of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Has Been Eliminated – Relief and Rehabilitation Are Being Hastily Organized</h3>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The remnants of bandits in the border areas of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces have been gradually eliminated after Wei Lihuang, the director of the three-province border area, dispatched troops to cooperate with local militias to suppress them. The strong self-defense organizations of the people in the counties along the border have also played a crucial role. Currently, Wei Lihuang is supervising more than ten counties in western Anhui, including Huoqiu, Lihuang, and Lu'an, to expedite post-disaster work. However, due to the severe drought in the autumn and the impending winter famine in the counties of the three provinces, coupled with the aftermath of the banditry, disaster relief in the post-disaster phase is particularly important. The 500 yuan donation raised by the Border Area Director's Office from the Suiyuan Provincial Government, and the 1,000 yuan donations from Hebei and Gansu provinces, have been distributed in advance to the provincial governments of Henan and Anhui for distribution to alleviate the immediate crisis. Miao Peicheng, the Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Commissioner and Special Commissioner of the Anhui Party Affairs, to understand the disaster situation in the border areas after the bandits were suppressed, recently accompanied Hu Yiguan, a member of the Anhui Design Committee, to inspect post-disaster work in various places in western and central Anhui. They passed through Qianshan, Taihu, Tongcheng, Shucheng, Lu'an, and Lihuang, reaching Huoqiu on the border of Anhui and Hubei. After completing their work, they planned to return to Nanchang to handle official duties at the Jiangxi Supervisory Commissioner's Office. (7th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang County Prison Negligence During the Day</h3>
<p>At 2 PM on the 8th, a sudden fire alarm occurred in the Songjiang County Prison. The guards and prisoners immediately climbed onto the roof to suppress the fire with tiles. The fire was slightly contained. Water hoses from various sections were used for rescue, but the four pump vehicles failed to discharge water due to broken belts. The Beidou Wengong Temple rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after spraying for more than forty minutes. When the fire was raging, Zhang Qin-fu, a prisoner sentenced to five years for opium offenses, seized the opportunity to climb over the wall using a ladder while still in shackles. He was later captured by the water patrol team inside the North Gate. After interrogation by County Magistrate Li, the prisoner gave evasive answers. Suspecting him of arson, he was sentenced to additional shackles and returned to prison to await punishment. The fire only destroyed straw stacks and beams in the wood storage room.</p>
<h3>Changshu Bureau Chief of Saltpeter and Sulfur Swindles</h3>
<p>A new bureau has recently been discovered here, headed by Zhang Zhifang, the Bureau Chief of Saltpeter and Sulfur, who has absconded with several thousand yuan. The authorities are currently pursuing him. A guest from another province, Zhang Zhifang, claiming to be an official from the Saltpeter and Sulfur Bureau of Suzhou, sought the position of Changshu Branch Chief during the summer. He traveled extensively in Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, making extravagant claims and recruiting staff. Hearing this news, many unemployed individuals eagerly sought introductions to secure a position. Zhang then established standards, requiring a deposit of 800 yuan for the position of section chief, 500 yuan for the position of section staff, and even 200 yuan for clerks. For a time, there were many staff members, and the deposit received was substantial. Zhang then returned to Suzhou, promising a large sales quota, and successfully obtained the position of Changshu Branch Chief. In mid-September, he came to Changshu and set up an office in Wuyi Street in the city, renting all the equipment and utensils from a furniture store. At that time, there were dozens of staff members, including section chiefs, section staff, clerks, investigators, and auditors. Unexpectedly, within a month, all the saltpeter and sulfur in the bureau were sold, and Zhang absconded with the money, disappearing like a yellow crane. The staff in the bureau not only received no salary, but also had no means to cover their meals. The Suzhou Bureau received the news and immediately dismissed Zhang, issuing an arrest warrant. They also appointed another official to replace him in Changshu. However, it is impossible to accommodate the large number of staff members, and a solution has yet to be found.</p>
<h3>Widening the First Main Road</h3>
<p>The county government, recognizing the urgent need to widen the streets in the county seat, originally planned to start work on the first main road next year but now aims to complete it by the end of this year. The plan is to enable cars to travel directly from Nandou to the northern suburbs starting next year. It has been decided to start work on widening the South City Gate and Nandou Street immediately. Other sections, such as South County Street, West County Street, City Center Street, Temple Front Street, Academy Lane, and Hanbei Gate Street, leading directly to the North Gate, must also begin construction within the year, widening them to eight meters. Shops and residences on both sides must be demolished and vacated within a specified period.</p>
<h3>Wuxi All Theaters Petition</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Grand Theater in Gongwei, within this county, was in the midst of a performance at 4:30 PM on the 7th when more than twenty soldiers from the third platoon of the fourth company of the sixth security battalion insisted on entering the theater without tickets. When the theater staff refused, the soldiers became furious, shouting and rushing into the theater, destroying property and assaulting people, creating a tense situation and causing great disorder. As a result, six audience members, including Shen Huashan, Chen Bujie, Zhu Shenkang, Gu Amu, Yu Agen, and Da Huang, were injured. They also tore down a notice from the Second District Security Command hanging at the entrance of the theater, throwing it on the ground before dispersing in a rush. The Zhongnan Grand Theater also experienced a similar incident at 8 PM on the same day. The two theaters reported the incidents to the entertainment industry association, requesting assistance. The association immediately convened an emergency meeting and decided to (1) submit petitions to the special commissioner's office, the district security command, the county government, and the county chamber of commerce, (2) seek punishment for the soldiers who committed the violence, (3) guarantee that similar incidents would not occur again in the future, (4) request that military and police agencies revise the rules for accommodating military police, and (5) if the above petitions failed to achieve their goals, they would telegraph the central government ministries and provincial agencies, and implement a county-wide industry-wide strike until their goals were achieved. Yesterday morning (the 8th) at 10 AM, over a hundred representatives from various theaters jointly submitted petitions to the special commissioner's office, the chamber of commerce, and other agencies. The special commissioner's office advised the representatives to return, promising to send personnel to investigate and severely punish the soldiers who caused the trouble. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3>Submitting a Request to Dissolve Cooperatives</h3>
<p>The county government of this county recently received instructions from the Construction Department regarding the re-registration of cooperatives in all counties of this province, which must be completed by the end of October this year. Failure to meet the deadline would be considered invalid and no re-registration would be granted. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Long immediately instructed Guan Senbao, the county's cooperative guidance officer, to complete the task within the deadline. A total of eighty cooperatives in this county re-registered on time. Thirty-two cooperatives failed to re-register on time. Yesterday, County Magistrate Long submitted a list of the unregistered cooperatives to the Construction Department, requesting permission to dissolve them.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Dysentery Rampant in Prison</h3>
<p>The county prison is overcrowded and the buildings are dilapidated. An epidemic has occurred, resulting in several prisoner deaths. The epidemic has not diminished in recent days. Recently, Dai Xingsheng, a prisoner incarcerated for morphine use, also died in prison from dysentery. After inspection by Shen Cheng, a judge, the family was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Slaughter Tax Transferred to a New Contractor</h3>
<p>The slaughter tax in Wu County was previously contracted by Wang Jinyu. Due to the high bid amount at the time, it has been unprofitable for the past year. The payment of the tax is still unclear. For the 25th fiscal year, the provincial education fee management office invited bids for the contract. It is now learned that the winner of the bid is Zhang An, with a bid of 41,202.02 yuan. He has been appointed as the contractor and the county has been instructed to comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Requesting Exemption from Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>Citizens Chen Zixian and Zhi Zi Yi of Zhenjiang, due to the county government issuing notices demanding payment of the first and second installments of land price tax for the city and suburbs for the 24th year, and because the land price tax rate was too high, petitioned to have it reduced. The Finance Department instructed Zhenjiang County to forward the matter to the Land Administration Bureau for re-estimation and registration. The land price tax was established by the late Premier Sun, and its methods align with the principles of accurate and fair taxation. However, if the land price in Zhenjiang City is inaccurate and the land tax is unfair, and the authorities have re-evaluated it, then the county government's notices demanding payment are inconsistent with the clarification of the facts. Therefore, they submitted separate petitions to the Finance Department and the county government yesterday, requesting an exemption from the tax and requesting to increase the number of local representatives on the land price assessment committee, in accordance with Shanghai County's method, to facilitate public discussion.</p>
<h3>Nantong Taizhou Area Bandits Punished</h3>
<p>After the banditry in Taizhou, the Fourth District Security Command dispatched Deputy Commander Peng Longxiang to lead troops to suppress them. On the afternoon of the 7th, Peng returned to Nantong, reporting that the bandits had been completely pacified. A total of forty bandits were captured. The two leaders were sent back to the headquarters, and the rest were handed over to the Taixian County government for interrogation and punishment. Six bandits were killed in combat. Three watch posts in rural areas were disarmed for collaborating with the bandits.</p>
<h3>Sishang Cotton Trade Resumes Weighing</h3>
<p>Due to the soaring cotton prices, the cotton trade in Sishang areas of Tongtai exceeded normal levels. After shipping to Shanghai, there were huge losses, so weighing was uniformly suspended to suppress the rising prices. On the 7th, after negotiation between the factory and trading associations, weighing resumed. However, due to the sharp drop in prices, arrivals were scarce.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Opium Offender Dies in Prison</h3>
<p>Lu Dengshan, a 65-year-old resident of Yangziqiao Town in this county, was arrested and imprisoned in January of this year for operating an opium den in the town. He was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. He had been ill several times in prison. Because he had no guarantor, he was unable to be released on parole. Yesterday, the prisoner died in prison due to illness. The procuratorate was notified and dispatched personnel to conduct an autopsy before preparing a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin Large Fire at Shimatou</h3>
<p>At 1 PM on the 5th, a fire broke out in West Street, Shimatou, outside the city. Although various fire brigades from inside and outside the city went to the rescue, due to the prolonged drought and strong winds, and because it was located in a market street, a total of twenty-nine houses were destroyed. The affected people included the families of Wu Pan, Zhu Yongxiang, Xu Yongnian, Sun Rulin, Ling, and Yuan. The cause of the fire was that Sun Rulin and his wife, Qian, were not at home, and their young child was playing with matches, which spread to the bamboo fence and other items.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou Yangqing Road Extended to Haizhou</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department, in order to facilitate transportation between northern Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, has decided to extend the road to Haizhou, connecting it to the Longhai Railway. Personnel have been dispatched to survey the route. Construction is expected to begin in about a month, which will further facilitate transportation between northern Jiangsu and Anhui. In addition, the county government, in accordance with provincial orders, is protecting various highway bridges to avoid any impact. County Magistrate Cao has ordered strict protection to prevent any negligence.</p>
<h3>Chicken and Duck Egg Prices Soar</h3>
<p>Farmers in this county often engage in chicken and duck egg production as a side business. The value of eggs shipped to Shanghai, Nanjing, and other places each year is five to six hundred thousand yuan. Recently, due to the extremely low egg production from old chickens and ducks, and new chickens and ducks not yet reaching the egg-laying stage, production has been greatly reduced, while demand remains high, and prices continue to rise. Chicken eggs are currently selling for twenty yuan per hundred catties, an increase of more than five yuan from before. Duck eggs are twenty-four yuan, an increase of more than four yuan from before, and the trend of continued price increases remains.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Establishment of a Wheat Demonstration Zone</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Agricultural and Forestry Improvement Station, in order to improve wheat production, has established a wheat demonstration zone outside Genshanmen, Hangzhou City, at Yaodian Bridge, allocating 210 mu of land for demonstration purposes. Yesterday, several instructors were specially dispatched to guide farmers in the method of soaking seeds in warm water and preventing and controlling diseases and pests. In addition, in order to improve the Huangyan tangerines, a demonstration orchard is being established in that county to conduct fertilizer cultivation experiments and prevent and control fruit tree pests.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Strong Men and Road Workers Fight</h3>
<p>The Jiaoshandou Bridge section of the Jiashan to Zhongdai Jiaoshan Highway, from Jiaoshandou Bridge to Tingzi Bridge outside the South Gate, has been completed. Starting on the 6th, strong men from Dushun, Qingliang, Shuangxi, Dayun, Ginkgo, and other places were responsible for speeding up the construction of earthwork, with a deadline of the 7th. The road surface was the responsibility of the Provincial Engineering Office. On the 7th, strong men from the third and fourth guaranties of Ginkgo Township went to build the road. Unexpectedly, a supervisor, identified as A, was naturally irritable. Without asking the reason, he used a large section of firewood to beat the strong men severely. As a result, the road workers and the strong men engaged in a fight. Although the guarantor, Huang Zifang, and others tried to persuade them, it was ineffective. Four strong men were injured, and an elderly strong man was even more seriously injured. Knowing that he had caused trouble, the supervisor rushed to the county government to report and request assistance. The situation is feared to escalate.</p>
<h3>Cixi Diphtheria Rampant</h3>
<p>In the urban and rural areas of this county, due to the recent half-month of dry weather, cool mornings and evenings, and hot middays, coupled with unclean drinking water, various infectious diseases such as malignant typhoid fever have taken the opportunity to rise. The most rampant is diphtheria, which is coming on strong. It is spreading widely, mostly affecting children under the age of ten. Many have died due to being unable to receive timely treatment.</p>

<h3>Second Group of Trained Citizens Holds Graduation Ceremony Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu and others Inspect and Address the Graduates; Over Seven Thousand Citizens Trained</p>
<p>According to Central News Agency, the second group of trained citizens in this city held a graduation ceremony and took an oath at 8:00 AM yesterday. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the oath-taking and awarded certificates. Representatives from the Ministry of Interior of the Training Headquarters attended the meeting and gave speeches. The 8,000 trainees were energetic and moved in an orderly manner, which was commended by officials and guests. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The ceremony venue was set up at Longhua Airport. The entrance was located next to the cement factory road. The ceremony platform was built on the west end of the field, with the main stage in the center. The flags of the Party and the nation, a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and a portrait of Chiang Kai-shek were hung in the front. Below them were placed awards and flags presented by various sectors. The guest seats were on the left and right sides of the stage. At the north end of the field, a huge colored painting was erected, with Sun Yat-sen in the center, Chairman Lin Sen on the right, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on the left. The trainees were divided into ten major brigades, fifty-five squadrons, and two provisional and Jinan school worker auxiliary teams, totaling 7,878 people. They arrived at the venue early in the morning, lined up in front of the stage, with orderly formations on the east, south, and north sides. The Municipal Public Security Bureau band was located in the north of the field. Mayor Wu entered the venue to the sound of military music before 8:00 AM, and the ceremony began immediately.</p>
<p>Inspection</p>
<p>The first item on the agenda was the flag-raising ceremony. All stood at attention, and the national flag was slowly raised to the sound of military horns. This was followed by a military parade, commanded by Chief Commander Tao Yishan. The inspectors were Mayor Wu and Commander Yang Hu. The accompanying officials were Secretary-General Yu, City Council Speaker Wang Xiaolai, Director of the Education Department of the Training Headquarters Du Xinru, representative of the Ministry of Interior Ge Jianshi, representative of the Municipal Party Committee Jiang Huaishu, directors of the Municipal Government bureaus Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang, Shen Yi, Chief of the Security Corps Ji Zhangjian, Director of the Civil Training Office Li Xiangqi, Deputy Director Wang Shaozhai, and others. They walked from the stage to the center of the field and inspected the entire team from north to south. After returning to the stage, the division ceremony began. Each team formed a horizontal line and marched past the stage in step, led by the military band. Applause from the guest seats was continuous.</p>
<p>Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>At about 9:00 AM, the graduation ceremony began. Each team lined up in front of the stage in columns. The order of the ceremony was as follows: (1) Mayor Wu, the chairman, takes his seat. (2) All stand at attention. (3) Play music. (4) Sing the Party song. (5) Bow three times to the portrait of Sun Yat-sen, the portrait of Chiang Kai-shek, and the flag of the Party and the nation. (6) The chairman respectfully reads Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament. (7) The trainees swear an oath: "I solemnly swear to implement the Three Principles of the People, obey the orders of superiors, defend the country, love the people, strictly abide by discipline, and be loyal to my duties. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment." After the oath, Mayor Wu issued certificates and commemorative medals. The captains of each major brigade went to the stage to receive them on behalf of their teams to the sound of music, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>The original text of Mayor Wu's speech at the graduation ceremony of the second phase of citizen training is as follows: Representatives of the Central Government, honored guests, officers and members of the Citizen Training Corps, today is the graduation ceremony of the second phase of citizen training in Shanghai. Since the implementation of citizen training in Shanghai, the morale of the people of Shanghai has been invigorated, and the atmosphere in Shanghai has become more tense. The citizens of Shanghai, who were used to a decadent urban life, have gradually changed to a more energetic and lively life after being influenced by citizen training. This is not only a gratifying event for Shanghai, but also the most promising and bright thing for the future of the Republic of China. The Republic of China has a glorious history of more than 4,000 years, a vast territory of more than 4 million square miles, and a population of 450 million, accounting for one-quarter of the world's population. We also have abundant resources, with almost all the products in the world. Our ancestors made the earliest contributions to world civilization, and the Chinese nation can be considered the earliest nation in the world with creative abilities. Since we have such a glorious history, and our land cannot be said to be not vast, our population cannot be said to be not large, our resources cannot be said to be not abundant, and our nation cannot be said to be without creative abilities, why has China become so weak today? Why is our nation oppressed and bullied to this day? Where is the reason? Let me tell you, comrades, an ancient Chinese saying goes, "Man can conquer nature. Anything that does not exhaust human effort will inevitably fail." This is an inescapable common principle. The reason why China is weak and declining, in essence, is due to poor human planning. We have long lost the spirit and ability of our ancestors to create the world. Although we have a population of 450 million, our great strength cannot be concentrated or brought into play. Therefore, even though we have vast land and abundant resources, they are useless. Analyzing the reasons: (1) Our physique is not strong, so we are called the "sick man of East Asia." (2) We only emphasize individual liberalism, so the entire nation is like a heap of loose sand. (3) We have always lacked the spirit and habit of observing discipline. A nation like this is naturally oppressed and bullied. If we do not have a thorough awakening and fundamental transformation, our nation will inevitably perish one day. Chiang Kai-shek, seeing this, followed Sun Yat-sen's teachings to promote the glorious history of the Republic of China for more than 4,000 years, restore the spirit of our ancestors to create the world, organize the people of the whole country into a national group, give them strict training, and transform the entire life of our nation in order to adapt to the survival of the modern environment. All citizens must receive compulsory education and strict training. The process is divided into "Boy Scout training," "student training," and "citizen or militia training." Citizen training is required for all citizens within a certain age. The purpose of the training is: (1) to strengthen the physique, make citizens physically strong, and accustomed to hardship, so that everyone can undertake arduous tasks; (2) to strengthen the spirit of unity, so that citizens are accustomed to group life; (3) to cultivate the habit of observing discipline among citizens. These are indispensable conditions for a nation to compete for survival. If our citizens can all possess these conditions, the strength of our entire nation can be manifested. The current national crisis can be overcome and resolved by the strength of our 450 million people. In other words, we must concentrate the strength of the people of the whole country to build a new China and revive our nation. This is the first profound significance of citizen training. Secondly, the important significance of citizen training is, of course, to strengthen the national defense. The current international situation is unpredictable, and the tragic disaster of human struggle may break out at any time. Therefore, the world's great powers are all alarmed by the imminent threat to the lives of their nations and are all strengthening their military preparations and inspiring their people to strengthen their national defense and ensure the security of their national survival. China, with its deep-seated weakness and the decadence of its people's character, does not think of rising up and becoming strong. At the same time, with its empty national defense and insufficient national strength, it has become the focus of the great powers' covetousness. If we do not immediately become aware, prepare urgently, inspire the people, and strengthen the national strength, then once something happens internationally, our old and decadent nation will inevitably become the sacrifice of the great powers' struggle for supremacy. Although the ultimate goal of Sun Yat-sen's nationalism is to promote the inherent moral civilization of our country, to adjust and rebuild international relations with the kingly way, to realize national equality, and to attempt the great harmony of the world, in the historical relationship of human evolution, that is, in the necessary stage of cultivation, governance, and peace, especially today when justice is not guaranteed and peace is threatened, if we do not have sufficient national strength, no enthusiastic national morale, no solid national defense, and no self-defense force, then the survival of our nation will be in imminent danger of persecution. Therefore, based on the principles of nationalism, we must first strengthen our national defense in order to guarantee the survival of the country, to guarantee world peace, and to realize our ideal of improving international relations. After receiving training, you comrades are considered new citizens in the whole country and new city dwellers in Shanghai. In the future, the survival of the entire national society of China will be greatly related to you. The impact can turn the country from danger to safety and the nation from weakness to strength. Therefore, today's graduation ceremony is the most memorable day in the epoch of your personal history. After completing your training today and taking the official oath, you should fulfill your oath, obey your leaders, believe in the Three Principles of the People, support the National Government, unify your will, and align your steps. Work together to build a new China, revive the Chinese nation, and complete the great cause of the National Revolution. When the country is in trouble, you must not shirk your responsibility, but fulfill the national duty of defending the country and live up to the government's earnest intentions of training you.</p>
<p>Yang Hu's Speech on the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison</p>
<p>Commander Yang Hu attended and gave a speech. The original text is as follows: Officers, citizens, today is the graduation of the second phase of citizen training in this city, and a military parade is being held. Just now, I saw your movements, spirit, and exercises were all very good. This is of course due to the effective education of your officers and your own efforts. As commander I am very satisfied. At the same time, I have a few words to say to you. Why does our government implement citizen training? Because the country is formed by its citizens, and every citizen has the natural duty to defend the country. But at the same time, they must have the skills to defend the country. Especially those citizens who stand on the front line of defending the country must be technicalized, militarized and disciplined. We can understand that the government's implementation of citizen training, and everyone's participation in training, is of great significance. Secondly, after receiving training, what kind of ambition should everyone have for the country? Since everyone came to receive training in order to defend the country, after receiving training, of course, the ambition to defend the country must be strengthened. Now that the national crisis is imminent, our only way to revive our nation is through self-determination and struggle. Only by supporting our government and our leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, can we save our country from danger. I hope that after graduation, everyone will be ready to serve the country at any time and ready to sacrifice for the country at any time.</p>
<p>Representative Addresses</p>
<p>Du Xinru of the Training Headquarters said, "Everyone is neatly dressed, dignified in attitude, and consistent in training. You have a basic understanding of the training manual. I am very satisfied. This shows the enthusiasm of Mayor Wu and all the officers, and the efforts of everyone. However, citizen training, in addition to training, has great significance. I hope you will remember the officers' speeches and strive to implement them." Ge Jianshi of the Ministry of Interior said, "I hope that everyone will work hard to eliminate the title of 'sick man of East Asia,' and eliminate individualism and the habit of being romantic and undisciplined." Commander Yang said, "I hope that you will work hard to be loyal to your duties and defend the country." Councilor Wang said, "Young people should work hard and not have an old attitude. I also hope that you will work hard to promote the aviation salvation movement and the one-day movement." Director Li said, "Remember the officers' speeches and live up to the expectations of the government and the people." Finally, Cao Chao, a member of the 33rd Squadron, gave a reply on behalf of all the members, saying, "Thank you Mayor Wu and all the officers for your speeches. We will always strive to promote the unity of citizens throughout the country."</p>
<p>Shouting Slogans</p>
<p>1. Practice national military training. 2. Cultivate self-defense forces. 3. Support the revolutionary leader. 4. Revive the Chinese nation. 5. Implement the Three Principles of the People. 6. Long live the National Government. 7. Long live the Republic of China. 8. Long live Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The event concluded with a group photo at around 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan's Representative Tai Shoumin Talks About the Tension in Jin-Sui Exceeding Ji-Cha; Troops Are Deployed to Block the Enemy, Preparedness Prevents Trouble</h3>
<p>Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, specially sent representative Tai Shoumin south to pay respects to Duan Qirui. Mr. Tai arrived in Shanghai the night before last. Yesterday, he went to Duan's residence to pay respects. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit. According to the conversation, a certain party is instigating the puppet bandit army to invade Sui and threaten Jin. Although Jin and Sui are two provinces, they are practically one. Currently, the puppet bandit army advancing on Jin and Sui includes three parts: one is the Zhuo Shihai troops belonging to De Wang, who is being used; one is the puppet army of Li Shouxin; and the other is the bandit army of Wang Ying. They are advancing on separate fronts. The tension in Jin and Sui exceeds that of Ji and Cha. Currently, in addition to Chairman Fu Zuoyi of Sui Province deploying troops to block the enemy, Jin Province is also prepared for any eventuality. I will stay in Shanghai for a day or two and then go to Beijing to reside there permanently.</p>
<h3>He Yaozu Pays Respects to Duan Yesterday</h3>
<p>He Yaozu, the Chinese ambassador to Turkey, arrived in Shanghai from Luoyang a few days ago and went to Duan's residence on Xiafei Road yesterday morning to pay respects to Duan Zhizhiquan. He is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for a while and then return to Beijing. As for He's request to resign from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it has not yet been approved by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is rumored that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering abolishing the embassy in Turkey because Turkey has not yet established an embassy in China, and He's resignation is a prelude to the abolition of the embassy. According to inquiries from relevant parties, this rumor is not confirmed. In order to save money, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs once intended to reduce the organization of the embassy in Turkey, but has not yet made a decision.</p>

A naming ceremony will be held at a later date.</p>

<h3>Branches of the Hongkou District Citizen Associations Declare Support for the General Association's Proposals; Hoping That Japanese Residents Can Advise the Authorities to Stop Short of the Brink and Avert This Crisis</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation issued a letter of advice to Japanese residents in Shanghai in order to stabilize the market and save industry and commerce, the fifth, sixth, seventh, tenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, twenty-sixth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth, thirtieth, thirty-first, thirty-second, thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh, thirty-eighth, thirty-ninth, fortieth, and forty-first branches of the Hongkou District have issued a declaration unanimously supporting the proposals of the General Association. The original text states: "Our Hongkou District has a vast area and is a commercial hub, known as a prosperous region. However, since the September 18th Incident, especially since the January 28th Incident, the economy of the citizens has plummeted, and various industries have fallen one after another. Our district has suffered particularly. Companies and shops on various roads have been unable to withstand the huge waves and have been liquidated and closed down one after another. Even those who勉强 continue to operate are losing money step by step and are difficult to sustain for long. This is a clear and obvious fact that is seen and heard by all. Recently, since the Haining Road incident, the Japanese troops stationed in Shanghai have posted sentries and patrols across the border for no reason, causing panic and alarming people several times a night. The discovery of Chinese traitors and ronin in neighboring counties is even more likely to cause misunderstandings. As a result, the timid are moving away one after another. The industries and commerce of our district were originally like residual leaves in the autumn wind, and now they are even more unsustainable. If this continues, the market in our Hongkou District will be completely destroyed. The commercial scope of Japanese residents in Shanghai is almost entirely in the Hongkou District. They are also suffering. This time, our Citizens' General Association witnessed the difficulties of the times, understood the crux of the matter, and cared about the market in our district. It specially issued a letter to Japanese residents in Shanghai, hoping that the Japanese residents can advise the authorities to stop short of the brink, avert this crisis, and appeal to stop the Japanese military's actions in Shanghai in order to reassure the people and maintain the market. Our association expresses sincere support for the proposals of the General Association and hopes that all sectors will consider the impending collapse of industry and commerce in our district and work together to find a solution."</p>

You have the responsibility to defend the border and defend the territory. You should have the determination to 'pay an eye for an eye' and 'a tooth for a tooth' to sweep away the enemy and quell the banditry. All Chinese people with a conscience will do their utmost to provide manpower and financial resources to support you. Our society assumes the responsibility of 'everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world.' We are willing to share the heavy responsibility of saving the country with you and swear to be your backing. Respectfully, China Women's Society."</p>
<h3>Sun Weidong and Li Guangping Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday Under Song's Orders</h3>
<p>Assisting Xiao Zhenying in Handling Departure Procedures: According to Shen Shi News Agency, Xiao Zhenying, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee and former Mayor of Tianjin, came to Shanghai a few days ago to prepare to go abroad and treat his illness. However, due to incomplete procedures, the date of departure is uncertain. Xiao reported to Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee in Beiping, and Song specially sent Sun Weidong, director of the 29th Army's office in Beijing, and Li Guangping, director of the office in Shanghai, to Shanghai to assist Xiao in handling departure procedures. It is now learned that Li Guangping returned to Beiping earlier to report to Song, and the matter has been completed. However, Sun was sent to Shanghai by Song. Both arrived in Shanghai yesterday and stayed at the residence of a certain dignitary on Lafayette Road. After resting at the residence, they immediately went to meet Xiao for talks. It is said that Li and Sun, except that Li will not return to Beiping for the time being, Sun will go to Beijing and return north within a few days.</p>
<p>According to a Central News Agency dispatch from Beiping on the 8th, Song Zheyuan gave Xiao Zhenying 100,000 yuan in travel expenses for his overseas inspection and has sent someone to Shanghai to deliver it to Xiao. It is reported that Xiao will be able to set sail this month.</p>
<h3>Prince Awang Arrives in Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday Afternoon; Will Return to Beijing Within Days to Sit in Town; Says Pseudo-Bandit Invasion of Sui Will Not Succeed</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Altan Ochir (referred to as Prince Awang), the vice chairman of the Sui Border Mongolian Political Council, the vice leader of the Ikezhao League, and the Commander of the Hangjin Banner Security Force, left Beijing for Shanghai on the 6th and went to Hangzhou. After touring Hangzhou for three days, he left Hangzhou for Shanghai on the express train at 8:30 yesterday morning and arrived at the North Station at 12:45 noon. Because no notice was given in advance, few people came to welcome him. After getting off the train, he went straight to the Great China Hotel on Xizang Road to rest.</p>
<p>Accompanying Personnel: In addition to Prince Awang's wife, son, and Chu Mingshan, the director of the Mongolian Affairs Department of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission who was accompanying and hosting, there were also Bulin Toktokhu, the representative of the Ikezhao League stationed in Beijing, Sumuya, the captain of the Yingqi Zhangjing of the Hangjin Banner, Balejima, the secretary of the Mongolian Political Council, Gu Zhaozhong, the captain of the Hangjin Banner Security Team, and 23 servants.</p>
<p>Southern Mission: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit yesterday. Prince Awang sent Bulin Toktokhu, his representative stationed in Beijing, and Gu Zhaozhong, the captain of the security team, to meet the reporter. According to the conversation, Prince Awang's southern trip was to congratulate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on his birthday and to seek instructions from the Central Government on how to deal with the pseudo-bandit army's invasion of Sui. Because the Central Government's orders had not been issued, he took the opportunity to tour Shanghai and Hangzhou. He is scheduled to return to Beijing within the next two or three days. After staying in Beijing for two or three days, he will return north to his banner to sit in town as soon as he receives the orders. On the way, he may have to detour through Luoyang to meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and present everything in person.</p>
<p>Situation in Sui East: As for the situation in Sui East, before we went south on the 24th of last month, only Wang Ying's bandit troops occasionally invaded, but they only advanced to places where there were no troops stationed by us. They did not dare to invade places where our troops were stationed. It was not as strong as reported in the previous newspapers. Recently, there have been frequent reports that the situation is getting tighter. We have only seen the reports and have not received any telegrams. We do not know what the actual situation is. If it is indeed the case, the Jin-Sui army has sufficient strength and solid defenses, and the pseudo-bandits will never succeed.</p>
<p>Organization of Mongolian Banners: The reporter then asked about the organization of the leagues and banners. According to the reply, there are 18 banners under the Sui Border Mongolian Political Council. The chairman of the Political Council is Prince Sha. Prince Awang is the vice chairman. The Ikezhao League has jurisdiction over seven banners. Prince Sha is also the leader of the league, and Prince Awang is the vice leader. In terms of strength, the entire league has more than 6,000 security team members. This banner (Hangjin Banner) accounts for more than 1,400 members. In recent years, there have been many military disasters and droughts, and the people are poor. The finances of the Political Council are extremely difficult. The council's expenses rely entirely on the Central Government's monthly grant of 25,000 yuan. This time, the Central Government was requested to provide business expenses, which are expected to be approved, but no official order has been received yet. At present, we are striving to promote education. The Ikezhao League, in addition to the one primary school that has already been established in this banner, is in the process of establishing schools in other banners.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Set to Leave for Home on the 10th</h3>
<p>Soviet Ambassador to China, Mr. Dmitry Bogomolov, took the night train to Nanjing on the 6th to preside over the celebrations for the 19th anniversary of the October Revolution and to bid farewell to Foreign Minister Zhang. He left Nanjing by night train at 11:00 PM last night and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He immediately returned to the Soviet Consulate on Huangpu Road to rest and is scheduled to leave Shanghai with his secretary, Mr. Orshanin, on the 10th to return home to participate in the Soviet National Congress.

<h3>Luo Zhongyi Heads to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Luo Zhongyi, the envoy to Denmark who has been summoned back to China, arrived in Shanghai on the 3rd. Yesterday at 1:25 PM, he left Shanghai with his family by special night train for Nanjing to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang, report on his duties, and plans to stay in Nanjing for four or five days to visit old friends and tour the capital's construction. He is scheduled to leave Nanjing on the 13th to return to Shanghai and then visit various places to inspect the people's conditions.</p>
<h3>Various Groups of River Rice Pour In, Market Prices Drop Again</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, as it is now deep autumn, the late rice crops in various places have been harvested and are freshly entering the market. Therefore, river rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Tongli, Zhangze, Jingxian, Qingpu, Zhujia Ge, Wuxian, and other regions is flooding the roads. Every day, sixty to seventy rice boats arrive at the North and South Market rice wharves, causing the rice price in this city to drop continuously due to the abundant supply and surplus of food. In the past week, it has fallen by six or seven jiao per dan. After the market opened yesterday morning, prices fell again by a small amount, one or two jiao.</p>
<p>Late Rice Harvested</p>
<p>This year, due to the favorable weather, with ample rainfall in the summer, the late rice in various places has had bumper harvests. Each mu yields three shi of pure rice. Harvesting has already begun, and the earliest crops have already been milled. However, around the Mid-Autumn Festival season, when the rice ears were ripening, there was a sudden drought that lasted for a long time, causing incomplete development and slightly smaller rice grains. As for planting next year's spring crop, the cracked fields make sowing quite difficult.</p>
<p>Agricultural Hoarding</p>
<p>This year's agricultural production, both spring and autumn harvests, has been abundant. Normally, farmers sell all their produce to pay taxes and debts. However, this year is different. Since the central government implemented the rural revitalization plan, and with the agricultural banks and other commercial banks in various provinces providing agricultural loans secured by crops, whether seeds or rice, they accept them all, regardless of quantity. Farmers have ample financial liquidity, so aside from selling a portion of their produce to pay taxes, debts, and interest, they hoard the rest, waiting for a good price.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Instructs Factories to Implement Workers' Savings Plans, To Be Implemented in the Nearest Term</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, aiming to promote the welfare of workers by having factories implement workers' savings plans, had previously instructed the relevant authorities in various provinces and cities to order factories to implement workers' savings plans. However, some factories have not yet complied with the order, which is deemed inappropriate. The Ministry of Industry has again instructed all factories to implement these plans in the nearest term to improve the well-being of workers.</p>
<h3>Various Organizations Preparing to Expand Anti-Smoking Propaganda Week to Eliminate Smokers</h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, since the implementation of anti-drug and anti-smoking measures in this city, the number of smokers has gradually decreased due to the efforts of the responsible authorities. To eliminate all opium addicts in the city within the specified time limit, the city Party headquarters, the Songhu Garrison Command, the city Public Security Bureau, the city Anti-Smoking Committee, the Military Commission's Shanghai Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office, and other organizations have jointly discussed an expanded anti-smoking propaganda movement week to make citizens deeply aware of the harm of opium and its relationship to the survival of the nation. The various methods have been decided upon, and the various organizations are preparing separately. If time permits, it is scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Screening Films</p>
<p>Because film propaganda is deeply moving, the Central Film Studio has been approached to borrow various films and slides on drug resistance for the propaganda movement week. Special screenings will be held in cinemas, free for public viewing, or slides will be added before the film screenings to raise awareness among citizens. In addition, the city Public Security Bureau's Anti-Smoking Committee will print propaganda materials and send police to distribute them in various districts, and airlines will be asked to borrow airplanes to distribute leaflets over the city.</p>
<p>Dispatching Inspectors</p>
<p>Cai Jingjun, the director of the city Public Security Bureau, believes that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the population is dense, making it very difficult to carry out anti-smoking policies. After strictly ordering the districts to work hard on the policy, the results have been quite effective. Fearing that negligence may arise over time, Dai Lizhen, the head of the fourth section, has been specially dispatched to inspect the districts daily and strictly order his subordinates to work diligently to ensure that smokers are eliminated within the time limit stipulated by the central government.</p>

<h3>Hongkou Women's Hospital Corpse Burial Case, Zhang Wenhua Disagrees with Death Sentence Verdict, Appeals to the High Court, Saying That Lu Aili Died from Uterine Bleeding, Yu Gengsheng Died from Air Entering During Blood Transfusion, Appellant Did Not Inject Poison and Can Be Reviewed</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenhua, a doctor from Shanghai at the Hongkou Women's Hospital at 290 Zhaofeng Road, and his assistant and concubine Chen Xiaobao (that is, Liang Meiwang), were arrested by the Huishan police for murdering Lu Aili, a woman from Sichuan, and Yu Gengsheng this year, and burying their bodies underground. The case was sent to the First Special Court, and after several trials, the confessions were clear. Zhang Wenhua was sentenced to death for joint murder, and Chen Xiaobao was sentenced to life imprisonment for joint murder. Zhang Wenhua, upon learning of the verdict, disagreed and has now hired lawyer Yu Enliang to write a statement listing the reasons for appealing to the Second Branch of the High Court. The above reasons are briefly recorded as follows: (1) Facts: The Hongkou Women's Hospital opened by the appellant is dedicated to treating women's diseases, not abortion. This time, Yu Gengsheng came with Lu Aili to request an abortion, saying that they were not formally married and became pregnant, and their abdomen was swollen and they were ashamed to meet people. If they did not find a way to abort, they would only perish together. The appellant was moved by their urgent words and reluctantly accepted. Unfortunately, he encountered other things that caused great stimulation, so he could not calm his mind, and hurriedly performed the operation on Lu Aili. With a little carelessness, he used too much force and accidentally clamped the uterus, and blood flowed into the abdomen, which was extremely dangerous. Yu Gengsheng immediately argued with the appellant, and said he would report it. In order to save him from the worst, the appellant asked Yu Gengsheng to go upstairs to draw blood so that he could transfuse it into the patient's body. Unexpectedly, due to the busy operation, air flowed in by mistake, causing him to be unable to be saved. Lu Aili also died because of the long delay. The appellant was mentally weak, and witnessing this sudden change, he was distraught, and he vaguely thought that the corpse would become a zombie, so he used gauze to block her neck to prevent other changes and prevent the odor from overflowing. Fearing that misfortune would occur, he moved the two corpses under the floor. He went to check them afterwards. This is the fact of the case. (2) Reasons: According to the facts stated above, all parts of the appellant were not intentional. Lu Aili died naturally due to a uterine rupture, and it was by no means a human method to kill her. If the appellant had the intention to kill Lu Aili afterwards, checking the uterine rupture would surely lead to a quick death, so why use poison again, and why strangle her with a cloth? Even the most foolish person would never do this. Also, Yu Gengsheng actually drew blood to save Lu, and died because of the flow of air. The police said that Lu Aili's body was injected with a large amount of "Pabinal" poison, and Yu Gengsheng's body was injected with "Panana" ten Xi Nei sleeping pills, which are consistent with the prosecutor's autopsy report, which said that there was a tight gauze belt, but no obvious fatal signs. This is even more inconsistent, because the tear sheet did not verify that there were the above-mentioned poisons and sleeping pills in the two corpses. It is said that regarding this point, it is sufficient to prove that the appellant's confessions in the police station and the first court were all forced by the environment, confused, and confused when he lost his mind, and are not sufficient for the determination of facts. If not, I would only request a re-examination. If poisons and sleeping pills are found to be injected into the corpse, they can die without regret. Based on the above points, the appellant did not have the intention or premeditation to kill, and cannot be held responsible for the crime of murder. If the police want to prosecute, they should prosecute in accordance with Articles 165, 276, and 289 of the Criminal Law, and the court’s verdict should also refer to Article 19, Section 2, Article 57, and Article 59 of the General Principles of the Criminal Law, and the appropriate responsibilities for abortion negligence and destruction of evidence should not rashly impose the death penalty on the appellant, who adopts the principle of resurrection. Therefore, he filed an appeal, requesting that the original judgment be revoked and that the appellant be sentenced to other appropriate crimes in order to show conviction and extend the cloud of grievances.</p>
<h3>Cod Liver Oil Imports Increase Sharply, Most Shipped from Norway</h3>
<p>Cod liver oil is a wonderful tonic, and many Chinese people consume it. However, most of it is imported. According to customs statistics, imports totaled 81,493 gold yuan from January to September this year (October has not been published), compared with only 51,348 gold yuan in the same period last year. Most of it was shipped from Norway, with a total of 60,885 gold yuan in nine months, followed by Japan with 5,461 gold yuan, Germany with 3,969 gold yuan, the United Kingdom with 7,181 gold yuan, the United States with 3,634 gold yuan, and other countries with 360 gold yuan.</p>
<h3>Eleven Bounced Checks Used to Swindle 1,279 Yuan and Eight Jiao for Yarn</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, Xie Zhongyi, a patrol officer from the Zhabei Zhongxing Road Police Station, according to the plaintiff Song Rengui's report, 42 years old, from Ningbo, living at 4 Baokang Lane, Beijing Road, Concession, opened a yarn number. Yao Changhui, who lives at Gende Lane, Pushan Road, and Zhang Jianfang, who lives at 11 Yongyuli, South Mountain Road, bought yarn from me and paid a total of eleven checks for a total of 1,279 yuan and eight jiao. When they went to pay, it was discovered that the bank had no deposit for the defendants. When they tried to reason with them, they refused to pay. He requested an investigation. Officer Xie ordered the police to summon the two defendants, Yao and Zhang. Yao Changzhen confessed, 43 years old, from Anhui, that the checks were given to me by Li Hanqing to buy yarn from the Song surname. In fact, Song Rengui and Li see each other every day. They were very friendly. After the two agreed, they asked me to buy yarn. Now that the Li surname has not been brought to justice, it has nothing to do with me, and I cannot be held responsible. Zhang Jianfang confessed that he was 42 years old, from the same hometown as Yao Changzhen, and the rest of the words were similar to Yao's. After verifying the confession, Officer Xie immediately sent the plaintiffs and defendants to the Xinzha Branch Bureau. Subsequently, the bureaucrat learned the details of the incident and ruled that it was a crime to issue bounced checks, so he ordered them to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Robbing Farmhouses and Insulting Young Girls</h3>
<p>Farmer Zhu Guansheng lives in Hejiazhai, west of Meilong Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and lives by farming, which is quite comfortable. Unexpectedly, six robbers who spoke with a Hakka accent and wore short clothes suddenly came in to rob at midnight the night before. The whole Zhu family was awakened from their dreams, and they were tied up with ropes and driven into a room, forbidden to speak. Guan Sheng's eldest daughter, Xiuzhen (19 years old, Xu will be married this month), had her clothes stripped off and planned to burn her lower body with fire. After Xiuzhen begged bitterly, she was willing to hand over 225 yuan and two gold rings and a pair of gold bracelets from the sale of cotton. Xiuzhen was released. More than a dozen pieces of newly made silk wedding clothes were also taken away. Yesterday, the owner issued a loss list and reported it to the local Public Security Bureau, requesting to be dealt with.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Zoo Letter Pigeon Research Association Meeting: Pigeon Racing Between Beijing and Shanghai; Spatial Distance Measured at 120 Miles; First Place Arrived in 3 Hours and 35 Minutes; Top Five Winners Announced, Full Results Pending</h3>
<p>The Letter Pigeon Research Association attached to the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road held the Beijing-Shanghai Letter Pigeon Race yesterday. The top five winning pigeon owners were determined and announced last night. The details of the race are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Departure from Nanjing</p>
<p>The participating pigeon owners in this race include Li Xinming, Zhang Yuyan, Zhao Liangmin, He Renjie, Zhou Zhizhi, Shen Zongde, Chen Zhaoyuan, Xia Yongzhen, Wang Jingyuan, and other nine units, with a total of 58 pigeons.

<p>Dispatching Recorders</p>
<p>The finish line of the race is Shanghai. After the pigeons arrive, they all fly back to their nests, so personnel must be dispatched to wait and record the time. In addition to the zoo staff Xu Bingrong, Cao Shuixiang, Bao Chan Hong, etc., who took turns recording, many others were temporarily hired, including Sun Sijiu from the Municipal Party Headquarters and student Xu from Qinghua Middle School, who all went to wait at the pigeon nests before noon. At the same time, pigeon breeder Chen Qihui was invited to stay at the zoo to receive telephone reports from each pigeon nest.</p>
<p>Returning Shanghai Pigeons</p>
<p>From 12:05 PM yesterday, the pigeons successively flew back to their nests in Shanghai. By 5:00 PM, 25 pairs had flown back. The arrival times and pigeon owners' names are recorded below: 12:05 PM, 2:15 PM (both pigeons from Zhang Yuyan); 1:00 PM, 1:15 PM, 1:35 PM, 2:50 PM, and 2:50 PM (all pigeons from Zhao Liangmin); 1:01 PM, 1:01 PM, 1:11 PM, 1:11 PM, 1:20 PM (all pigeons from Chen Zhaoyuan); 1:06 PM (pigeon from Wang Jingyuan); 1:05 PM, 1:06 PM, 1:06 PM, 1:06 PM, 1:06 PM, 1:21 PM, 2:48 PM (all pigeons from Xia Yongzhen); 1:22 PM (pigeon from Li Xinming); 1:16 PM (pigeon from Shen Zongde); 1:25 PM (pigeon from Zhou Zhizhi); 1:45 PM, and 1:45 PM (both pigeons from He Renjie).</p>
<p>Top Five Winners</p>
<p>The arrival times of the above pigeons must be proportionally calculated due to the varying distances of the pigeon nests to ensure accuracy. The Datong News Agency specifically requested the judge, Mr. Chen Qihui, to calculate and announce the top five winners first yesterday. Mr. Chen agreed, and after calculating the pigeon nest distances and adjusting the times, he announced the arrival times of the top five pigeons and the names of their owners as follows: First place: 12:05 PM, Zhang Yuyan; Second place: 11:06 AM, Zhao Liangmin; Third place: 1:01 PM, Chen Zhaoyuan; Fourth place: 1:06 PM, Wang Jingyuan; Fifth place: 1:05 PM (pigeon nest closer than the fourth place), Xia Yongzhen.

<h3>The Salted Fish Trade Association Experienced a Bloody Incident Yesterday: Thugs' Extortion Failed, Leading to Resentment; Weng Zhaofang Was Severely Injured in a Chopping Attack</h3>
<p>The Jieshun Fish Shop in Huiguan Lane, No. 16, in Nanshi, is opened by a Ningbo tycoon named Yu and has been in business for decades. The manager, Weng Zhaofang, a native of Ningbo, is 45 years old and has worked in the shop for over 30 years. He is extremely capable and has accumulated considerable savings. Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, he went to the Salted Fish Trade Association in Taiping Lane, Yangua Street, for business. While he was talking, a thug named Zhong A'san, who harbored resentment for failing to extort money from Weng, plotted revenge. He and a dozen other thugs, each carrying iron rulers and axes, learned that Weng was at the association and, led by Zhong, broke into the association's reception hall. One of the thugs shouted Weng's name, and when Weng Zhaofang came out from the reception room in response, Zhong A'san raised an ax and struck Weng's forehead, causing an inch-deep wound and injuring the back of his left hand, causing blood to gush out. Weng cried out in pain and was immediately hit in the left shoulder by the other thugs with iron rulers, causing him to faint and fall into a pool of blood. The people in the association were shocked and immediately reported to the police. The thugs scattered. Zhong A'san was apprehended on the spot, and the bloody ax handle was seized. The injured Weng Zhaofang was sent to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, and the culprit, along with the ax, was taken to the 16th Pu Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>The Machine-Made Noodles Industry Conference: A Renewed Request to Suppress Flour Prices</h3>
<p>The Machine-Made Noodles Industry Association of this city, recently affected by the continuously rising flour prices, making it difficult for its members to maintain their livelihoods, has previously appealed to the authorities to strictly prohibit speculation and monopoly and to set price limits. Yesterday, a members' conference was held at the Jingjiang Guild Hall in Laoximen, attended by over 100 members. Representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Wang Yucheng, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongjun, were present. Xu Jinfa, Chu Shaokun, and Chu Shaoji were elected as chairmen, and Gu Linshi as the recorder. The important issues decided upon included: (1) Unifying the retail price of noodles throughout the city at 240 cash per catty and the wholesale price at 220 cash; (2) Violators of the unified price, whether members or non-members, will be penalized according to Article 8 of the industry regulations; (3) Sending a letter to the Rice Dealers Association to notify rice shops that also sell noodles to comply with the regulations; (4) Revising membership fees, dividing them into two levels, ranging from 20 to 40 cents per month; (5) Re-submitting a petition to the Bureau of Social Affairs to strictly order the suppression of flour prices. The petition is as follows: A Petition to earnestly request a strict order to suppress flour prices, to alleviate the people's livelihood and solidify the foundation of the country. We believe that rice and wheat are the foundation of the people's livelihood and cannot be lacking for even a day. To ensure that the supply and demand are balanced and the prices are equal, so as to avoid speculation and rising prices and the panic of the people's livelihood, the government authorities should enforce control. As the ancient sage said, "When the people have enough food, the world will be happy," it can be seen that the foundation of a country lies in the people's food. If the people's food is worried, then the foundation of the country is also in danger. Currently, our country's flour supply is insufficient, let alone for export, which has led to rising flour prices in recent months. The business of our industry and the livelihood of the people are increasingly panicked. The association previously submitted a request to your Bureau to order that each bag should not exceed three yuan and two jiao in national currency, and received a reply that the Flour Exchange had been ordered to handle it. However, the recent flour market remains the same. If noodle prices are increased, it will not only harm the business of the trade, but also affect the people's livelihood. Therefore, it is necessary to endure painful losses. If we do not remedy this, the business will be difficult to maintain. It was resolved at today's members' meeting to submit another request to your Bureau to order equal suppression of prices and prohibit exports, so as to strengthen the foundation of the country and enrich the people's food. We eagerly await your consideration and swift order to flour merchants to quickly stabilize market prices and prohibit exports, so as to strengthen the foundation of the country and enrich the people's food. This petition is submitted.</p>

<h3>The Robbery and Murder Case: Further Trial of the Perpetrators the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>At around 10:00 PM on May 27th of last year, the home of Zhang Juyang, a Siyang native at No. 70 Yangshupu Road, was invaded by several armed robbers who stole valuables worth 549 yuan and fatally shot Zhang You and Chen Buzhao, and wounded Zhang and Shi Jinzhu. The police arrested four members of the gang, Ma Jinbiao, Wang Jinsheng, Wang Fu, etc., who were handed over to the First Special District Court and sentenced to imprisonment. They confessed that the leader, Gao Xiaoguanzi, a Siyang native, had fled. On October 24th at around 10:00 AM, the Chinese detective Pang Jinshan from the Yangshupu Police Station discovered and arrested him, whose real name was Gao Hongbang, in a bungalow on Haizhou Road. He was sent to the Third Criminal Court. He confessed that he had gone to Nanjing City to stay at the home of his friend Li Jihai near the Dragon King Temple to plot things, staying for about a month before returning home, which could be investigated. Ma Jinbiao, Wang Jinsheng, and Wang testified in court, reversing their previous confessions and claiming that he had not gone with them to rob. The discussion was to detain him and send a letter to investigate and then interrogate him. The day before yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over a further trial in the First Criminal Court. According to the victim Zhang Juyang's testimony, the defendant was at the scene at the time, and there was no doubt about it. He also presented a threatening letter he received after the incident, instructing him not to reveal his name, otherwise his life would be in danger, so he did not dare to speak. Now that he has been detained, he dares to tell the truth. The letter was submitted for inspection. Gao Hongbang confessed, "I and others are engaged in lending money, he makes big profits, I make small profits, and there is accumulated animosity and false accusations. I am illiterate, how could I write a letter?" He hired lawyer Fan Gang to handle the case. Judge Zhong instructed that he still be held in custody, pending a reply from the Nanjing authorities, and rescheduled the trial for verification and determination.</p>
<h3>Famous Explorer Yang Dize Embarks on a Journey: Climbing the Himalayas to Set a New Record; Currently in the Interior of Burma with Two Americans</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, the famous explorer Yang Dize departed from Shanghai to Burma to collect specimens. On Saturday, the Continental Daily received a letter from Yang, stating that he had met with Harvard University students Mr. Lumis and Mr. Aimons in Calcutta and then traveled to Yangon. On the way, he climbed the Nanda Devi peak of the Himalayas, setting a world record. Fortunately, the good weather between the seasonal winds and the cold winter allowed him to overcome many difficulties and achieve his goal. He is now preparing to enter the interior of Burma with three months' worth of provisions. The areas they will pass through are inhabited by fierce barbarian tribes. Their goal is to hunt for golden monkeys. The letter also stated that the two Americans are in excellent spirits, and Yang is also happy to visit Burma again because in 1929, Yang had traveled to Burma with the Americans Mr. Kermit and Mr. Roosevelt. Yang and the two Americans will stay in Burma for two months and then travel to Shanghai together. The two Americans will stay for a short time and then plan to return to their country.</p>

<h3>After the Radio Administration Restricted Ten Types of Entertainment Broadcasts, the Entertainment Industry Rose Up in Opposition; a Committee Was Jointly Organized by Nine Groups to Ask the Association to Request Assistance from Party and Government Agencies</h3>
<p>Shanghai News states that the Shanghai Radio Administration's restriction on the broadcasting time of ten types of entertainment programs has been repeatedly appealed by various entertainment personnel to the Radio Administration, requesting that the restrictions be lifted. At that time, the Radio Administration claimed that these restrictions were temporary and would soon be lifted. However, nearly half a year has passed, and not only has the bureau not lifted the restrictions, but it has recently become even more severe. For example, the Municipal Entertainment Association recently held a joint celebration special program for all Shanghai entertainment personnel to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday, and afterwards, using the radio station was punished, further arousing public anger among all entertainment personnel in the city. They all believe that the Radio Administration is deliberately destroying entertainment personnel, so the research associations of Shanghai Opera, Sutan, and Monologues jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Entertainment Association, requesting relief. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Relief</p>
<p>(Above omitted) Entertainment is a powerful tool for promoting social education, so in recent years, under the leadership of the Party and government agencies, fellow members have separately organized research associations to engage in improvement, and all members have followed the guidance of the Party and government agencies, making every effort to improve and spare no effort. We hoped to gradually get on the right track and live up to the expectations of the country and society. However, starting in July of this year, the Shanghai Radio Administration of the Ministry of Communications suddenly ordered all radio stations in the city to restrict the broadcasting time of ten types of entertainment to no more than three hours per day, and stipulated that ten types of entertainment broadcasts were absolutely not allowed between 6:00 PM and 10:00 PM every day. In less than two months, the bureau suddenly ordered all radio stations to shorten the time by one hour (that is, each radio station shall not exceed two hours in total for ten types of programs per day). This move affects the livelihoods of all colleagues in the ten types of entertainment. The impact is small, and at this time of striving for improvement, the association and all colleagues have suffered a great blow. Considering the future of social education, we really cannot help but speak out. Currently, this move by the bureau is unfair, which makes the association and all colleagues angry and dissatisfied. Therefore, we jointly hope that your association will provide assistance to ensure that the Shanghai Radio Administration withdraws this order. Otherwise, thousands of colleagues from the association believe that this is a strange and great shame for our entertainment industry and will constantly appeal to the central and municipal Party and government agencies and all sectors of society for public judgment. We will never give up until we achieve our goal. The reasons why the association and others are dissatisfied with the Shanghai Radio Administration's restriction on the broadcasting time of ten types of entertainment are as follows: (1) If the Shanghai Radio Administration believes that the wireless broadcasting industry is a new educational tool, and all entertainment programs that generally provide entertainment are restricted, then the association and others would never dare to say anything different. The reason why the association and others are greatly puzzled is that the same entertainment programs are subject to restrictions for these ten types, while other types can be broadcast freely. Why favor the former and belittle the latter? This is the first thing that makes the association and others puzzled. (2) If the contents of the restricted ten types of programs are all inappropriate, then there are many other programs with lewd tones or absurd content. Why are they promoted and not restricted by the bureau? The association and other Su Tan are derived from Kunqu Opera, using colloquial language, and are absolutely small in number. Monologues are one of the emerging entertainment forms, and the lyrics adapt to the times and can be said to be warning the world and encouraging customs, which is beneficial to social education. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Shanghai Opera Research Association, it has made every effort to improve, and the facts are obvious and seen by the whole society. Why is it hated by the bureau this time and included in the restricted list? What is the intention? This is the second thing that the association cannot figure out. (3) The Shanghai Radio Administration said it restricts ten types of entertainment, but the bureau's instructions only list nine types. What does the remaining type refer to? The bureau has never clearly stated it, so all parties suspect that the remaining type may have obtained the support of a powerful person and is exempt from restrictions, or they suspect that the remaining type has obtained the understanding of the person in charge of the bureau due to special reasons. Everyone has different opinions, which makes the association and others puzzled. (4) Starting last year, the former Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and the former International Telecommunications Bureau (now merged into the bureau), in order to rectify the unhealthy entertainment, formulated measures for reviewing broadcasting manuscripts, which have been implemented for more than a year. All contents involving impropriety have been prohibited, and the contents of the manuscripts that have been reviewed and approved do not violate the review standards, and many have materials that supplement social education. Among the ten types of entertainment this time, the materials that have been reviewed and approved still have to be restricted. This contradictory and absurd move makes the association and others puzzled. The association and others are the general organization of all Shanghai Shanghai Opera, Monologues, Sutan, etc. Since being restricted, all members have felt that the bureau's actions are inappropriate and have expressed their dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Requesting the Bureau</p>
<p>(1) The materials that have been reviewed and approved should absolutely not be restricted again. (2) All entertainment in the city should be treated equally, and no longer favor the former and belittle the latter. The association and others deeply feel that since the Party and government authorities believe that the entertainment industry is a tool for promoting social education, the banning of unhealthy entertainment should be strictly enforced. However, the banning on the negative side is not as good as the improvement on the positive side. How can entertainment truly become a tool for educating society and promoting society? On the one hand, it depends on the guidance and promotion of the government and society, and on the other hand, it depends on the entertainment industry colleagues themselves being able to understand the importance of the mission they bear, work together, and seek common improvement. Now, when the association and others are following the guiding principles of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau and working hard and burying their heads in progress, they have encountered this accident, which is deeply saddened. For this reason, we have listed the experiences and asked your association to provide assistance and forward them to the Party and government agencies in the city to uphold justice and correct the Shanghai Radio Administration's errors.</p>
<p>Full Support</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the Shanghai Municipal Entertainment Association invited the personnel of the nine types of entertainment broadcasts and persuaded them separately through the standing director, Mr. Ding Shoutang, stating that he was responsible for requesting relief from higher authorities and solemnly instructed all parties that there must be no excessive actions. At the same time, it was reported that more than 300 entertainment personnel from nine types of broadcasts, including Monologues, Shanghai Opera, Sutan, Minor Songs, Yangzhou Opera, Siming Southern Lyrics, and various schools of Yijuan, held a joint meeting at the Entertainment Association yesterday and decided on six important issues. The nine entertainment associations jointly organized a committee to oppose the Shanghai Radio Administration's restriction on the broadcasting time of ten types of entertainment. If there is no satisfactory solution, they will not hesitate to make any sacrifices. All entertainment circles in the city, such as drama, storytelling, ballad singing, Runyushe, Yongsheyuh Huaiyang Storytelling, Story Broadcasting, Shaoxing Opera, Singing, Clapper Talk, Improved Ningbo Opera, and more than ten other groups, have joined the support one after another, and the situation is very serious.</p>
<h3>Yang Yisun Countersues Huang Wanshou, etc. for Theft, Fraud, and False Accusation, Alleging Forgery of Pledge Documents to Deceive and Defraud, Both Parties Provided Conflicting Testimony During the Preliminary Hearing</h3>
<p>Yang Yisun, a shareholder of Jinlong Cotton Weaving Factory, has recently been sued by Huang Wanshou and Chen Zhengrong jointly to the First Special District Court for fraud, etc. However, Yang believes that this action by Huang and others is a retaliatory measure. He has also retained lawyer Sun Biwu to file a lawsuit against Huang and others for joint theft, forgery of evidence, fraud, and false accusation. According to Yang's statement, he worked at the China Oil Lamp Company and became acquainted with Wu Jiamo, a colleague. Wu then partnered with him to open the Jinlong Cotton Weaving Factory, which officially started business in August of this year. Wu, as manager, took advantage of Yang's youth and inexperience, colluding with fellow villagers Pan Xingcheng, Huang Wanshou, Chen Zhengrong, Qin Defu, and others to direct factory employees Jin Guowen, Chen Zhengjia, Tong Suizhi, Wang Xiansan, Fang Xuewen, Yang Wanyuan, and many others to jointly conspire in the Jinlong factory office on the night of October 17th. They planned to forge a number of pledge documents and other papers and distributed many pre-forged checks with counterfeit seals to each person to serve as false evidence. Subsequently, they stole the factory's seal, account books, letters, checkbooks, as well as inventory such as yarn, cloth, towels, etc. Then Pan and Cheng Qin Defu and others posted advertisements claiming that the goods were either sold or mortgaged by Jinlong. Furthermore, Huang Wanshou and Chen Zhengrong acted as holders of the forged checks and fraudulent promissory notes to file lawsuits with deceptive intent, hoping to achieve their goal of defrauding money. This situation, their joint theft, forgery, and fraudulent actions are indeed apparent. Their organization is tight, their criminal intent sinister, and their methods are vicious, which is shocking and terrifying. If this is not thoroughly investigated and the truth is revealed, not only will they suffer huge property losses, but their reputation will also be harmed and lost. He requests that Huang Wanshou, Chen Zhengrong, and others be punished according to law. The preliminary hearing was held by Judge Zhong on the afternoon of the previous day, and both parties were summoned for questioning. Huang and others presented checks and other evidence, claiming that Yang Yisun had defrauded them. Yang, on the other hand, recounted Huang and others' conspiracy to steal goods and forge documents. In court, both parties held onto their own versions of events, requiring further detailed investigation. The hearing was adjourned for a later date.</p>

<h3>Municipal Zoo Exhibits Exotic Birds</h3>
<p>The Bald Stork Has Not Been Seen in the Country Before; the Hornbill Has a Mound on the Tip of Its Beak</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road has recently collected a variety of rare and exotic birds, which are on display in the park for public viewing. A reporter from Datong News Agency made the following inquiry:</p>
<p>The Vigorous Bald Stork</p>
<p>The zoo recently added a bald stork, with gray feathers and long legs, exhibiting a unique demeanor. Its beak is also particularly long. It is said to originate from the African region, so it is the first time it has been seen in the country. Its long beak can peck and capture fish in the water, making it exceptionally strong and outstanding.</p>
<p>The Peculiar Hornbill</p>
<p>In addition to the bald stork, a hornbill has also been newly displayed, with an ivory-like mound rising from the tip of its beak, making it an oddity among birds. In addition, Mr. Wu Yunfu donated two noisy frogs (including the previous one, there are now two), along with a recently purchased large lizard (commonly known as a four-legged snake) (including the previous one, also two), and a large python tail (including the previous tail, two in total). These various exotic species greatly enhance the interest of visitors to the park.</p>
<h3>Two Ancient Paintings Stolen from the Qianye Inner Garden</h3>
<p>Cuixiu Hall's Rockery Damaged, Temporarily Closed to the Public. The Inner Garden of the Shanghai Money Trade Association and the Cuixiu Hall of the Bean and Rice Trade Association are opened to the public on Sundays as per the municipal government's orders. However, Cuixiu Hall is temporarily closed due to the damage to the rockery, but the Inner Garden remains open as usual. The Yang Dongsheng and Xu Xingmin genuine landscape paintings hanging in the Huanyun Tower of the garden were suddenly stolen by thieves on the previous Sunday. Because these two landscape paintings are of considerable value, they were covered with red mahogany glass frames, which have now been stolen. The thieves were likely not just one or two people. The garden management office has reported the case to the public security agency and requested a strict investigation of the thieves.</p>

It is not only the largest and most reputable store in China, but also has a reputation that spreads to the East and West, and is highly praised by foreigners, and is the number one business among our country's products. In the past, during the Tsarist Russian era, because the store's silk products were granted special benefits such as exemption from inspection and tax when imported into Russia, its reputation at home and abroad was far beyond what ordinary stores could hope for. Today, all the important figures of the National Government also take their clothes from the shop, in order to promote it.

<h3>Thermos Bottle and Bicycle Industries Announce Price Increases</h3>
<p>The Municipal Thermos Bottle Manufacturing Association and the Bicycle Industry Association have issued notices of price increases due to soaring raw material prices. The following is a transcript: (1) The Thermos Bottle Industry Notice states, "Recently, the import prices of various raw materials have soared in the domestic thermos bottle manufacturing industry. However, the selling prices of our colleagues' products cannot be increased suddenly, resulting in a huge discrepancy between the two, causing unspeakable suffering to our colleagues. This association sees this difficulty and takes it as a great hidden worry. It has repeatedly convened meetings of colleagues to discuss ways to deal with the difficult environment. However, my colleagues believe that in the current economic downturn in the entire market, our domestic industry should not increase prices again, so as to give foreign goods an opportunity to enter. However, blood capital is at stake, and sinking ships are a concern. After careful discussion, in order to take care of both, the selling prices of several goods that are unavoidable have to be increased slightly in order to maintain blood capital and seek to preserve a line of vitality for domestic products. All previous orders will be cancelled from today. This is specially published in the Shenxin Two Newspapers to inform the purchasing customers and all sectors who love to buy domestic goods, and we will be grateful." (2) The Bicycle Association Notice states, "Dear Sir/Madam, due to the soaring prices of incoming goods and the sharp increase in costs, colleagues have decided that from today onwards, the prices of all goods will be increased by more than 10% to maintain blood capital and make up for losses. It is a last resort, and we hope that you will understand."</p>

<h3>Dedication Machine Prayer Football Tournament: French Business Club Defeats Donghua 3-2; French Business Club's Strong Lineup with 1-1 Score in the First Half; Mayor Kicks Off to Enthusiastic Crowd of 8,000</h3>
<p>The French Business Club football team, the champion of Shanghai football, has been particularly strong this season. Yesterday, with their average skill level and solid lineup, they defeated Donghua 3-2. This was one of the most exciting matches of the current football season. The close score indicates the intensity of the competition, and the skill level of the two teams can be assessed by this score. Yesterday's weather was mild and sunny. Seven or eight thousand enthusiastic football fans around the Shen Garden stadium cheered enthusiastically, creating the first grand occasion of this season's matches. The income of four to five thousand yuan will be entirely used for the dedication machine and birthday celebration. The following is a record of the match:</p>
<p>Overall View: The match was lively and exciting. Both teams displayed beautiful performances, which were considered quite satisfactory by football fans. However, Donghua's lineup was not entirely complete, proving the gradual decline of Shanghai football. The veterans are showing their age, and there are still few talented newcomers with comparable skills. Therefore, the Donghua team, which gathers the elite of Chinese players, cannot form a perfect team. In contrast, the French Business Club's lineup is more balanced than in previous years, with agile movements and strong kicks. Both offense and defense were satisfactory. Therefore, the French Business Club had the upper hand throughout the match. Although the first half ended in a 1-1 tie, there was still no winner in the 35 minutes of the second half. In the last five minutes, Donghua conceded two goals in a row, failing to maintain even a narrow defeat. They scored one goal in the last minute, resulting in a final score of 3-2.</p>
<p>Lineup Analysis</p>
<p>Donghua's goalkeeper, Zhang Rongcai, has made significant progress. His composure has reached perfection, and he has a good grasp of various saves. The return of the old lineup of Li Ning and Feng Yunyou as inside midfielders was very appropriate. Li Ning's performance was as heroic as ever. Feng inevitably showed signs of aging, but he was still capable of handling the situation and was better than Li Yichen. Chen Zhenhe's center-back position suited his identity. Gu Shangxiang and the new player Ding Zhaocheng seemed to have a gap between generations. The forwards lacked coordination, and at crucial moments, they could not cooperate effectively. Sun Jinshun was the weakest performer among the forwards yesterday. Jia Wan and Er were both mediocre and not as good as before. Xu Wenkui still lacked skills and was too physically weak, despite his courage. Dai Linjing was still the most outstanding talent, but it was difficult to be completely satisfied. If Donghua wants to compete with the French Business Club for dominance, they must intensify training and strive for coordination.</p>
<p>Champion Qualities</p>
<p>Success or failure is not the only measure of a hero, but yesterday's victory of the French Business Club was not accidental. Although yesterday's match was an exhibition, it foreshadowed the situation of the Western Union Group A Championship and can be considered a prelude to the two teams competing for this year's championship. Therefore, the French Business Club also fielded its most complete lineup, with the famous player Parker still on the bench. Each player's skills were above the average level. Only the right winger, Fafan Xiao, was slightly weaker, which was the biggest regret for the French Business Club. The Walter brothers, one as a forward and one as a center-back, were the soul of the French Business Club. Colete and Bayer, the former has regained his old form, and the latter is a promising newcomer, both satisfactory. Roberts Stoff and Bausart were like a pair of lions, with their fierce attacks and quick ball handling, putting their lives on the line and being the most feared figures by the opponents. The defenders Ma Shan'er and Boguis were heavily fortified and impeccable. Bossen Zhong's defense was worthy of being the best in Shanghai. The team's coordination was also quite satisfactory. Because of their fast running, they often used long passes, making the match tense and exciting, pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>Mayor Kicks Off</p>
<p>At about 1:50 PM, the mayor entered the field with his entourage and took his seat in the chairman's seat. The Public Security Bureau military band began to play, and the audience applauded, making the atmosphere suddenly excited. The referee Le Xiurong took on a difficult task, officiating for the first time. After the coin toss to determine positions, the French Business Club faced the sun, and Donghua had the right to kick off first. The mayor performed the kick-off ceremony, kicking the ball out, and the match began. At the third chime, the French Business Club's right inside forward, Walter, intercepted the ball kicked by the mayor and began to attack Donghua. After several exchanges, Wan Xianghua received a long pass from Dai Linjing on the border, dribbled to the side of the goal, and was saved by Colete. The little black man passed the ball to the right wing, and Jia Youliang's cross was saved. Xu and Dai were very active.) The yellow-haired Bayer took the lead and saved many balls. The little devil Bausart frequently intruded on the frontier. Once, he sent the ball to Donghua's goal, and Fafan Xiao shot hard while lying on the ground. Rongcai saved it into a corner kick.</p>
<p>Good Fortune</p>
<p>After Donghua cleared the danger of the corner kick, Chen Zhenhe dribbled the ball out, and Sun Jinshun passed the ball to Wan. Xianghua quickly advanced to the baseline and kicked the ball to the French Business Club's goal. Jia Youliang rushed up diagonally and headed the ball into the air. At 10 minutes, Jamie Walter (i.e., the right winger little Walter) got the ball on the midline border and sprinted away. Feng Yunyou lost his footing and missed the ball. Li Ning could not turn around in time. Gu Shangxiang saw the ball in danger. Fafan Xiao had already received Walter's pass and took the lead, shooting hard at the goal. Rongcai waved his hands, hoping to catch the ball, but the ball had already bounced off the crossbar and into the bottom of the net. The audience was shocked. Donghua kicked off to counterattack. Xianghua lost the ball due to a mistake, missing a good opportunity. Sun Jinshun aimed at the goal twice but did not aim accurately. Dai Linjing's shot was beautiful and pleasing to the eye, but it flew out behind the goal by a fraction of an inch.</p>
<p>Wenkui's Wonderful Shot</p>
<p>Roberts Stoff and Bausart, two tiger generals, were constantly attacking and defending in Donghua's penalty area, making Donghua feel terrified. Boss's shot from 40 yards away was as fast as an arrow. Zhang Rongcai dived to save it. Both sides' movements were very excellent. Donghua was attacked for a long time. Fortunately, they united their forces to consolidate their defense and did not collapse. After 35 minutes, Donghua was able to breathe again and counterattacked. Wan Xianghua obliquely attacked the goal, and the French Business Club's center-back headed the ball out. Ding Zhaocheng returned the ball to the front of the goal. Bosen Zhong pushed it to the back. Jia Youliang took a corner kick. After a long struggle between the two sides, the ball once again entered Donghua's goal. Li Ning sent it out, and Sun Jinshun passed it from the middle. Xu Wenkui dribbled the ball in and made the final move on the penalty line. The ball passed through the crowd. Bosen Zhong saw that the situation was not good and immediately sat down to meet it. The ball had already passed through the decisive line and entered the corner of the net. The sound of firecrackers rose from the ordinary seats, and the audience's suppressed emotions exploded like spring thunder, filling the stands.</p>
<p>The Situation Calms Down</p>
<p>The French Business Club attacked again, and Bausart fired a cold shot. The ball bounced off the crossbar and down, only an inch away from the goal line. Fafan Xiao was ready for it, but because he raised his foot too slowly, Li Ning caught up and saved it. The first half ended soon. Donghua's forwards seemed more energetic after resting and attacked several times, but none were effective. The French Business Club's Roberts Stoff had two extremely dangerous attacks. Fafan Xiao headed the ball once but was saved by Rongcai. Sun Jinshun shot the goal twice, but neither was accurate. Dai Linjing attacked again but was still unsuccessful. Fafan Xiao sent out a corner kick, which was perfectly placed. Rongcai dived to save it with one hand, winning a lot of applause. The two sides went back and forth, but neither made any progress. Their movements were also quite tired, and the situation felt very dull.</p>
<p>Trouble in the Ranks</p>
<p>At 35 minutes, the calm situation was suddenly stirred up by the French Business Club, shocking the entire audience. Little Walter shot the ball, which flew towards Donghua's goal, passing through the empty space. Roberts Stoff rushed in horizontally and kicked it in, achieving a miraculous feat. Three minutes later, Fafan Xiao made another contribution. In a short time, Donghua conceded two goals in a row, which was unexpected. They then shook their spirits and tried to make a final fight. Sun Jinshun used his iron legs to shoot at the French Business Club from a distance of 40 yards away from the goal. Ma Shan'er was anxious and flustered, trying to kick it back, but his foot was not accurate, and the ball slid into the goal from his foot, catching Bosen Zhong off guard and conceding a goal. This was in the last minute. The match ended immediately, and the French Business Club won 3-2.</p>

<h3>Fourth Longhua Long-Distance Race: Niu Hongquan Wins Championship Again; Time: 1:08:09.5; Wang Zhenglin Second, He Baoshan Third</h3>
<p>The fourth Longhua round-trip long-distance race, organized by the Xiguang Cross-Country Team, started at 8:00 AM yesterday in front of the Minli Middle School on Zhonghua Road in the South City. Ninety-eight people participated this time. The entire course was 12 li long, equivalent to 20,000 meters. Niu Hongquan of Chizhi University finished the entire course in 1:08:09.5, retaining the championship. Wang Zhenglin finished second with a record of 1:12, and He Baoshan ranked third. Awards were given on the spot after the competition. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Start</p>
<p>A total of 102 people registered for this long-distance race. Ninety-eight people actually arrived yesterday. After completing the roll call at 7:40, they rested briefly and started at 8:00 AM in front of the Minli Middle School. With the starter Wu Zhenqing giving the order, 196 swift legs moved together and moved forward. A referee car led the way, and each runner had a guide who rode a bicycle to take care of them along the way, so there were no accidents along the way. However, because the weather was cold yesterday, more than a dozen people dropped out midway, which was a bit of a flaw.</p>
<p>Competition Situation</p>
<p>Many famous athletes participated this time. Everyone expected the champion to be one of Niu Fengquan, Wang Zhenglin, and He Baoshan. After the start, Niu and Wang were mixed in the crowd, unremarkable, while Ma Riji, familiar with the route and ambitious, took the lead and led the heroes. It was not until they reached Longhua Road that Lao Niu jumped out and took the lead. The skinny monkey followed closely behind, not daring to relax. After passing Nanyang Middle School, Niu Hongquan still led, while Wang Zhenglin gradually fell behind, forming a tie with He Baoshan. At this time, they alternated between being ahead and behind, competing fiercely. When they reached the pagoda under the attack and turned back, the lineup remained unchanged. After entering Kangqu Road, Lao Niu took advantage of his remaining strength and accelerated his pace. Zhenglin was unable to keep up, only sighing in vain. He Shishan was even more exhausted than the skinny monkey, and there were 40 to 50 meters between them. When they reached the finish line, Lao Niu finally retained the championship with a score of 1:08:09.5, leaving Wang Zhenglin 300 to 400 meters behind. Wang Zhenglin was second, and He Baoshan was third. The following were Ma Riji, Wang Rulin, and Ling Xuewen. The veteran Zhou Ruquan ranked fifteenth. A total of 74 people finished the race.</p>

<h3>Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— (Qing Qu) (Pseudonym, meaning "Lean and Refined")</p>
<p>Examining the "Shuo Wen Jie Zi" (《說文解字》, an ancient Chinese dictionary) under the "Grass" radical, it divides into three characters: "菊" (jú, chrysanthemum), "蘧" (qú), and "蘜" (jú). Therefore, nowadays, when yellow flowers are in full bloom, people often write these three characters interchangeably, thinking they refer to the same thing, without any difference. They even criticize the ancients for unnecessarily distinguishing forms, adding to the burden of later scholars and making it inconvenient, believing it would be better to simplify and shorten them. I think this view is seemingly correct but actually incorrect, so I write this to explain it.</p>
<p>The "Shuo Wen" annotation for "菊" says: "Large chrysanthemum 蘧麥" (qú mài, cowherb); the "蘧" annotation says: "Essence of the sun, blooms in autumn"; the "蘜" annotation says: "Swamp 蘧草" (qú cǎo, marsh plant). Therefore, these three characters do not specifically refer to "chrysanthemum" but have other flowers that correspond to them. If they are spoken of interchangeably, the name does not match the reality. This is a mistake that can be definitively stated. "蘧麥" is commonly called "Southern India Grass." From this, it is clear that it is not a specific name for yellow flowers. Some say that "菊" is a general term for bitter vegetables, which is close to the truth. "Essence of the sun" is confirmed by the "Ben Cao Gang Mu" ("《本草綱目》", Compendium of Materia Medica): "Chrysanthemum is also called 'Festival Flower,' also called 'Essence of the Sun.'" Since it is called "Festival Flower," it is probably what Xu Shen (author of Shuo Wen Jie Zi) called "blooming in autumn." Only "swamp 蘧" is untraceable. The collected annotations only say: "Swamp 蘧 is the name of a grass," which has nothing to do with "blooming in autumn." What I do not understand is that although the "Shuo Wen" lists them side by side, it does not refer to them as "chrysanthemum," so there must be something else. The book "Ming Yi Bie Lu" ("《名醫別錄》", Records of Famous Physicians) lists "nine names for chrysanthemum," but the two characters "swamp 蘧" are missing, which shows that "swamp 蘧" is definitely not "chrysanthemum."</p>
<p>The "Book of Rites: Monthly Ordinances" says: "鞠 (jū) has yellow flowers." This character "鞠" should be explained as "鞠 (jú)," which the "Shuo Wen" says: "Tà jú (踢鞠, an ancient Chinese football)." The "Guo Ce" (《國策》, Discourses of the States) also says: "Also play tà jú." The annotation for "Liu Xiang Bie Lu" says: "Cù jū (蹴鞠, another name for ancient football) was made by the Yellow Emperor, probably to train warriors through entertainment." Therefore, Yang Xiong's "Fa Yan" (《法言》, Model Sayings) also says, "Covering leather to make a jū." The "菊" being mistaken for "鞠" is because "蘧" and "蘜" are similar, leading to accidental writing errors. In the "Li Sao" (《離騷》, Encountering Sorrow), it says: "In the evening, I eat the fallen petals of autumn chrysanthemum." "菊" is originally a borrowed character. People only recognize "菊," so the original meanings of these three characters are not understood, and few can distinguish their origins.</p>
<h3>Chrysanthemum Talk</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Chrysanthemums are the most seasonal thing in this autumn. At the entrance of department stores, on the upper floors of hotels, in the reception rooms, on the dining tables, in short, in this oriental Paris metropolis of ours, wherever the shiny leather shoes of noble gentlemen can tread, there will always be potted chrysanthemums adorning the place.</p>
<p>The poems that poets write about chrysanthemums are countless, and whoever writes about chrysanthemums always praises them as noble scholars. However, chrysanthemums, as noble scholars, should not leave the eastern fence and live in this red and green, brightly lit, fragrant and rich atmosphere of wine and meat. This seems to pose a problem for the "character" of chrysanthemums that do not follow the mundane. Therefore, whenever I see chrysanthemums specially for the playthings of the young masters in the ivory tower, nodding so haggardly to welcome people, I always can't help but ask it, "Why do you also want to come here and join in the fun?"</p>
<p>But here, we have to take our words back. The mixture of chrysanthemums into this city is naturally not voluntary, just like the wild beasts in iron cages, involuntarily becoming tools for the "boss" to make money. Thinking this way, we should express 120 points of sympathy for these unfortunate chrysanthemums.</p>
<p>Among the flowers, it is said that chrysanthemums have the most varieties. From the color and structure of the petals, as well as the formation of the flowers, there are more than 1,700 species. The large flowers can be as big as the small heads of three-month-old babies. According to one of my relatives, this kind of chrysanthemum was seen in Huizhou. That was around the tenth year of the Republic of China. My relative was so fond of chrysanthemums that he specially sought a root, carried it back to Suzhou to plant, but unexpectedly, like oranges turning into trifoliate oranges when they cross the Huai River, the news came that the flowers turned into small flowers the following year. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, he went to Huizhou again. The owner of the chrysanthemums had passed away for many years, the courtyard was desolate, and it was said that the chrysanthemums had also disappeared with the owner long ago.</p>
<h3>Autumn Day Yellow Flowers</h3>
<p>— Nangong Sheng (Pseudonym)</p>
<p>When deep autumn arrives, the famous chrysanthemums by the eastern fence bloom proudly in the frost, showing off their beauty alone, not competing with the hundreds of flowers for supremacy, so autumn chrysanthemums have the reputation of noble scholars. Chrysanthemums have many colors, including bright red, pink, deep yellow, light yellow, emerald green, cyan, purple, and white, which are several times more beautiful than flowers with only one color. There are countless kinds of chrysanthemums, and there are hundreds of different names, all due to the different shapes and colors of the flowers, which determine many different flower names. Among them, they can be divided into rare and ordinary types. Ordinary types are easy to plant and very common and different. Rare types are not easy to grow and cannot be seen often. The so-called things are valued for their scarcity, and the types that are not seen much become precious and good varieties. Among the rare items, there are also many different types, such as green clothes and red skirts. The outside of the petals is light green, but the inside is pink. The Big Golden Peony is bright red and has golden threads, and the flowers are as big as a peony. The Green Calyx Plum is like a green calyx plum blossom. Although these are all rare items, they are not unique. There is a kind of tiger's claw, the petals are all like tiger's claws, and the tiger's whiskers, the petals are thin and curled, similar to tiger's whiskers. These two can be called the best of chrysanthemums, and it is not easy to get them. There is also a black chrysanthemum, chrysanthemums that are as black as ink, which is even rarer.</p>
<p>Growing chrysanthemums in horticulture is very difficult, especially if you want to maintain good varieties, because precious and famous chrysanthemums often mutate in the second year, not only the shape is different, but also the color will change. The most important way to grow chrysanthemums is to divide the buds. After the chrysanthemums bloom and wither in the first year, the chrysanthemum roots must be protected from frost and snow. The buds will rise in March and April of the following year. The core of a chrysanthemum often has more than one or two, and the chrysanthemum buds that are born below should be picked off in advance, leaving only the few on the top, so that when the chrysanthemums bloom, the flowers will be larger.</p>
<p>The petals of chrysanthemums can be added to food. The most famous is the chrysanthemum hot pot, where the petals are cooked with chicken, fish, shrimp, etc., to get a kind of very delicious and refreshing fragrance. There is also mixing the petals with flour, frying them in oil until golden, and eating them with sugar, the taste is refreshing, fragrant and sweet, more than the taste of magnolia flower slices.</p>
<p>Holding crabs and facing chrysanthemums is called an elegant thing. In fact, the appreciation of chrysanthemums can only be done in the garden and under the fence, so that you can appreciate the natural beauty and vitality of chrysanthemums. If you pile chrysanthemums in the room, subject to the scorching of the lights above and the fumigation of the wine and dishes below, the chrysanthemums will be frowning and unhappy if they know, which can be regarded as suffering bad luck. It is "the flowers under the lamp and beside the wine become a disaster, but it is beautiful to overturn the hermitage of the Eastern Fence." There are also many people who like to tie up fake rockeries with blue paper and put potted chrysanthemums on them, which is called a chrysanthemum mountain. That is the same as holding crabs to appreciate chrysanthemums, destroying the chrysanthemums and making them easily haggard. These are not the true meanings of appreciating chrysanthemums.</p>

<h3>Phoenixes Replaced in Nests</h3>

<p>Chapter 7: High Brotherly Love Hides Letter Pities Weak Sister; Heavy Poetic Spirit Peeks Shadow Smiles Cold Scholar</p>
<p>Youmei held one of his hands and shook it slightly, saying: It doesn't matter, if you have any difficulties, I will help you solve them. Your affairs are like my affairs, I can never deceive you. We have been classmates for so many years, and you and I have done several things together, you see me... Menglan suddenly grasped his hand back, and said: This is your misunderstanding, it is not that I do not trust you, but my heart is very confused, and I don't know where to start for a while. Youmei thought for a while and smiled: I understand your situation very well, it's good for you to think about it carefully, I won't ask you now. I'll come over tonight, and you can tell me again at night. Menglan smiled: That's a joke. If I want to tell you, why divide it into morning and evening? Youmei said: Of course, it is not convenient to tell me in the morning, and it is not convenient to tell me in the evening. But there is a long time for you to consider. If it is something that should not be told to me, you don't have to tell me at night. Menglan sat silently, looking down at the gold ring on his hand, rubbing his right index finger on the ring finger of his left hand. Youmei held his hand, patted his arm again, and smiled: You don't have to be distracted. I'll come again in the afternoon, waiting for your reply. Saying that, he stood up as if he was about to leave. Menglan held his hand and followed him to the door, frowning and saying: Why do you have to leave? The weather is so hot, it is inevitable that you will sweat twice. Youmei said: If your affairs are resolved, it doesn't matter if I sweat twice. Things that don't require sweat in the world can't be done well. Otherwise, it doesn't matter if I play here until night and go back, but my parents are like your parents, and if I go back late, they will be worried. Saying that, he raised his snow-white hand to his face and waved it at Menglan several times. Seeing his lively appearance, Menglan was deeply touched. He felt that life in this world should be happy at the right time. If he was like himself, he would only feel uncomfortable all day long, like being sick. In fact, he should learn from him. At that time, he sat down at the desk and thought hard for a while. His family thought that he was rushing to study to take the final exam. Therefore, he thought deeply, and no one came to disturb him. In the afternoon, the overcast rain gradually spread, and it started to rain. Although it was summer, the continuous rainy weather and the heavy dark clouds almost pressed on the roof, so sitting in the house was also cool. Meng just thought that it would be a mistake not to review his lessons at home on such a cool day. (95)</p>
<h3>Idle Talk about Pear Fragrance Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Ye Hang (Pseudonym)</p>
<p>In the 13th year of the Republic of China, the Nantong Agricultural School collected hundreds of famous flowers and held a chrysanthemum exhibition. At that time, Zhang Yigong's chrysanthemum garden in Haoyang Xiaozhu was very famous, but those who did not know Zhang usually had no way to see the Pear Fragrance Chrysanthemum. Therefore, it was sent to the exhibition for people to visit. The host of the chrysanthemum exhibition was afraid that the visitors would disregard public morals and damage Zhang's beloved, and historically valuable only famous flower in southern China, so he specially assigned someone to take care of this flower. At that time, I was studying in Chongchuan, and I took time to admire this rare treasure of the inner palace that caused a sensation in all the counties of Tonghai.</p>
<p>The flowers are planted in a Kangxi kiln, Yu Guotian Qing porcelain pot, about two feet in height, one stem and three branches, the stem does not grow young buds like other chrysanthemums, which can be transplanted. The color is like a pear flower, and if you look closely, the white seems to be tinged with carmine, like a beauty waking up early, with a natural beauty that seems to be lightly powdered without powder. As for the fragrance, it is like an Anjou pear, clear, elegant and light, refreshing the heart and lungs: if you cover the flower with a towel and hide it in a bag, the fragrance can last for several days. Perhaps the valuable thing is here? Mr. Se wrote an article to record the origin of this flower.</p>
<p>Two years before the Xinhai Revolution, he (Mr. Se) and Tang Shouchian of Zhejiang and others ran around with the intention of petitioning in the north, arriving in the capital, the Prince Regent expressed a sincere welcome: and when they left Beijing and returned south, the King gave a pot of Pear Fragrance Chrysanthemums, and said to Zhang: The flower is a treasure of the inner palace, and the pot is also loved by the Old Buddha (Empress Dowager Cixi), who intends to show his favor to him for the Old Buddha in dealing with a certain matter, so he bestowed the Pear Fragrance Chrysanthemum together with the pot. Wang's transfer to Zhang's was also nothing more than to make friends.</p>
<p>Zhang got this flower and repeatedly wanted to propagate it, but it was very strange. No matter how carefully you cultivate it, there is not a single young bud next to the stem. Later, according to those with experience in growing chrysanthemums, if you take it out of the pot and transplant it to the garden, it is difficult to guarantee that it will not wither and die. Therefore, Zhang gave up the idea of propagating it. Throughout Zhang's life, there was only one pot of Pear Fragrance Chrysanthemums in Nantong.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic of China, pear fragrance chrysanthemums were planted in chrysanthemum gardens in Tonghai counties. I was quite surprised, thinking that the young buds must have sprouted and been spread by Zhang's gardeners to various counties. I knew that after careful observation, I felt that there was no carmine in the white color, and the fragrance was also stronger, far less than what I saw in those years.</p>
<p>Later, after many inquiries, I learned that it was grown by those who grow chrysanthemums in Jinsha Cangyuan, Nantong, Jiangbei. The owner of the garden, Mr. Sun, has a Yuanming addiction and has a great understanding of growing chrysanthemums. He used scientific methods in early summer to choose chrysanthemum buds that bloom white flowers, covering them with Guigarden shells containing musk borneol and pear skin, and after about two weeks, gently removing the Guigarden shells, and the flowers will naturally have the fragrance of water pears when they bloom. Since Mr. Sun's variety was successful, fake Pear Fragrance Chrysanthemums have spread all over the north and south of the Yangtze River. Even those who grow chrysanthemums in Tonghai counties no longer value this kind.</p>
<p>Zhang Se-gong's tomb wood is already arched, and Xiao Ruo Gongzi has also passed away. I don't know if the pear fragrance chrysanthemum that was once cherished by Empress Dowager Cixi and spread to Haoyang Xiaozhu through the Prince Regent as a medium is still in this world?</p>

<h3>Japanese Chrysanthemum Dolls</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Our people always like to be self-effacing and praise others. The Japanese do the opposite, always praising themselves and belittling others. They also admit that Japanese chrysanthemums were introduced from China, but they boast that their chrysanthemum cultivation methods are now unique in the world. In particular, chrysanthemum dolls are a unique Japanese product. The author has visited several nurseries and exhibitions and found that, except for chrysanthemum dolls being special, they are far inferior to those in our country. Fortunately, they are good at promotion, so naturally, Westerners believe that chrysanthemums are a Japanese specialty.</p>
<p>There are not many types of Japanese chrysanthemums, and the colors are only red, yellow, white, purple, and brown. The quality is not high, and there are even fewer rare varieties. Because our people pay attention to chrysanthemum varieties when planting, while they only pay attention to styles and planting methods, the flowers are more lustrous and stylish, and the stems and leaves are more lush, which is better than ours. Potted chrysanthemums are very expensive, tall and large, with more than a dozen branches in each pot, costing two or three yuan. Compared to when our country's florists sell them, more than a dozen pots can be obtained for one yuan, which is truly incomparable. Japanese people sit on the floor, so if they display tall potted chrysanthemums, they will be taller than people's heads, making them difficult to appreciate. Therefore, there are also "hanging cliff" types, with flower branches hanging down two or three feet outside the pot, and the flowers are small and dense like stars. The price is half a yuan, and there are even fewer varieties, which are appreciated by ordinary people. Japanese people send flower wreaths made of chrysanthemums for funerals and store openings, except for violets. If chrysanthemums were precious, they would never be sacrificed like this, which shows that chrysanthemums are not particularly cherished in Japan.</p>
<p>Dolls are puppets, and making puppets is a specialty of Japan. There are artisans who make puppets. Small ones are for children to play with or decorate studies. Large ones are used as clothing racks in stores or to perform stories in amusement parks. Puppets are made of wood, sawdust, etc., and are vividly shaped, dressed in various clothes, and can perform all kinds of stories from ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign. Chrysanthemum dolls are slightly different. First, reeds and bamboo branches are woven into a frame, and the head and limbs of the puppet are attached. The clothes and decorations are all made of chrysanthemums. Because of the different colors of the chrysanthemums, the layers of the clothes can be highlighted. Sometimes green cypress branches are used as a background to distinguish the folds and heights. These figures are made when the chrysanthemums are still in bud and last until the flowers wither, at least for a month. Large ones need to be watered every night, because there is a lead water pan under the figure to hold water.</p>
<p>The chrysanthemums used to make dolls are not ordinary seeds. There is another kind with thin branches and leaves, and the flowers are small like silver coins, densely clustered together. They are first planted in the ground, and when it is time to make the statue, they are dug up, leaving some soil on the roots. When making the statue, the roots are inserted into the bamboo frame, and the flowers are exposed outside, as clothes, so the flower branches of the chrysanthemums must be the same height. The branches of chrysanthemums are easily broken, so it is necessary to be very careful. In addition to dolls, chrysanthemums can also be made into pavilions, sailing boats, cars, etc. The pots are as large as lotus tanks. First, bamboo frames are tied into various shapes on the tank, and then the chrysanthemum branches are guided to slowly cover the bamboo poles, forming various shapes. This is not a task that can be accomplished in a day or two, but the custom is unbearable and quite ridiculous. Japanese people flock to see chrysanthemum dolls every autumn, making it very lively. If you want to find famous varieties, you may search in vain.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>China's Currency Value Lacks a Measurement Standard</h3>
<p>— Tan Bingwen</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been reports of abnormal price fluctuations in various places. Some people think it is the result of hoarding, while others think it is a temporary phenomenon. I believe this is the result of China's currency value lacking a measurement standard.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly said (also in the Economic Supplement): the new monetary policy has overemphasized foreign exchange and neglected prices—and it is still the same now. Naturally, in China, which is eager for foreign loans and investment, if there is no guarantee of foreign exchange stability, other countries will be a little overcautious. Therefore, I am not like those mechanistic scholars who oppose foreign exchange without reservation. However, I believe that the core of the new monetary policy should be price stability. Speaking from the perspective of the public, price stabilization is undoubtedly much more important than foreign exchange stability. Normal Lombard said it well in his book Monetary Statemanship: the stability of foreign exchange is only related to foreign trade and investment, while price stability (that is, the expression of the domestic value of currency) immediately benefits even the remote villages. Because of this, I have compared price stability to "bear's paw" and foreign exchange stability to "fish." Mencius said it well: "One who forsakes fish to take bear's paw"——when two extravagances cannot be obtained at the same time.</p>
<p>In fact, in today's China, the two are not mutually exclusive——it's just that we don't want to have both. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy in November 1935, the authorities have pegged foreign exchange, which has somewhat joined the pound sterling group. The result is very satisfactory. There has been no risk in foreign exchange in the past year, which has promoted the smooth development of trade and investment to a certain extent, and its contribution cannot be ignored. Why is price completely ignored? Why do we only take emergency measures for price stability, instead of looking for theoretically and practically sound methods in careful consideration, like stabilizing foreign exchange? Before and after the implementation of the new monetary policy, prices moved abnormally, and then a lively price stabilization committee was organized, which later disappeared without a trace. Recently, prices have fluctuated abnormally again, and another price stabilization committee has been organized. These are all emergency measures that are of no help. We need to establish a long-term plan to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>Why do I say that China's currency value (specifically referring to its domestic value) has no standard to measure? This point is worth explaining in more detail. We know that in countries with a metal standard, when paper money has not developed, the value of a country's currency is measured by the weight and fineness of the standard currency metal. As long as the weight and fineness of the standard currency metal do not change, then if other factors remain unchanged, the value of a country's currency will also remain stable. Later, paper money developed, that is, in countries with a gold or silver standard, the main circulating currency is paper money, followed by checks, and then gold coins or silver coins. At this time, to know whether the currency value has changed, the main thing is to look at the trend of increase or decrease in the amount of note issuance reserves. At this time, the indicator of currency value in various countries can be said to be the amount of note issuance reserves. The note issuance reserve rate gradually decreases because there is more currency in the market, which is also a manifestation of the decline in currency value. Conversely, the excessively high note issuance reserve rate is a reflection of the high value of currency. Neither of these two is a good phenomenon. The best thing is that the reserve rate is always close to the legal reserve rate. Under the above two systems, the basis for maintaining currency value is the stability of the weight and fineness of the metal standard currency, as well as the stability of the metal reserve rate. However, the situation is different under the paper money standard. Gold coins or silver coins are no longer minted, and even if they are minted, they have no significant meaning, they are just for decoration. Similarly, the reserve rate is often not strictly observed. Although on the surface, the United Kingdom still maintained the old method of preparing securities of 126 million yuan and preparing 100% cash for the remaining note issuance after abandoning the gold standard in 1932, and the United States did not abolish the 40% cash reserve for note issuance. Even in China, the regulation of 60% cash reserve remains unshakable. However, this has no other purpose than to stabilize people's hearts. To put it bluntly, it is only used as a facade decoration. We don't ask what the preparation inside is, and we don't need to ask it. Stabilizing foreign exchange cannot be done by placing funds in China. We should not misunderstand the authorities on this point. In short, in terms of stabilizing foreign exchange, the government is impeccable in both technology and theory. Let's not talk too far. Under the managed paper money standard, like China now, is there any way to know the increase or decrease in currency value? What methods have been adopted so far? I want to say frankly that there are methods, and they are half-ready-made. The government seems to ignore prices—ignores phenomena that are closely related to the common people, and has not spent any effort on this. That is to say, China has not yet used anything to measure the domestic value of currency, although it has already used the pound sterling as a standard to measure the external value of its currency.</p>
<p>Almost all other countries use price indexes as a standard to measure the value of their currency after implementing the paper money standard. That is to say, by observing its increase or decrease from the price aspect, we know the change in currency value, and then use this as a basis to determine the benchmark for note issuance. Everyone knows that under the paper money standard or managed currency, the expansion of note issuance is very easy to occur. If you don't take a concrete and reliable thing as a basis and proceed aimlessly, isn't it like "a blind man riding a blind horse, approaching a deep pool in the middle of the night"? China's situation in the past year seems to be like this. There are plans for foreign exchange, but none for prices. We must know that under the Pegging method, the domestic note issuance quantity has no impact on foreign exchange. Therefore, those who dream of using the stability of the exchange rate to also know the change in China's currency value must be defeated.</p>
<p>I believe that this price change cannot be caused in a day or two, and it is not based on any exceptional factors, as generally speculated. It has been lurking for many years and has only now broken out. If we do not actively find ways to prevent it now (it is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost), I am afraid that it will cause even greater price fluctuations in the future. Under managed currency, if there is a lack of a central policy, it will become unmanaged currency, and people will be managed by currency instead. The lessons of Germany and France are worthy of our vigilance. How can China follow in their footsteps? Naturally, because the situation is still relatively normal, it will not lead to such a serious situation as before. However, the extraordinary period is approaching, so when will we regulate the price mechanism—that is, the currency mechanism?</p>
<p>If Gustav Cassel's purchasing power parity theory is true, then I will further infer that if the price—the domestic value of currency—is not handled well, the exchange rate—the external value of currency—will also be not handled well. The so-called currency machine purchasing power parity theory is roughly such a theory: in countries using gold or silver and countries using the paper money standard—or between countries using the paper money standard, the determination of foreign exchange is the comparison of prices between the two countries. That is to say, price ultimately determines the exchange rate. If the price mechanism is smooth, then the exchange rate mechanism can naturally be adjusted. Otherwise, it will be futile to seek exchange rate stability alone. Do the gentlemen who only consider foreign exchange stability and ignore price stability think that Gustav Cassel's theory is not worth referring to at all?</p>
<p>I repeat, China's currency value lacks a measurement standard. If we continue to follow this path, it will cause a great price panic. This is by no means alarmist talk. The danger of action lacking a definite policy is obvious. Furthermore, if this continues, the stability of foreign exchange may not be maintained for long.</p>
<p>The focus of this article is to point out the fact that China's domestic currency value lacks a definite standard. As for what standard should be adopted, and the various theoretical and practical issues related to this standard, it is not possible to provide them in detail within the scope of this article. I can only make the following simple conclusions here: we cannot adopt temporary emergency measures to deal with price fluctuations, but should establish a consistent policy. Up to now, the only basis for stabilizing the domestic currency value on currency is the price index. Although some people think that other indexes should also be referred to, such as the production index, the summer hire index, the securities price index, the market interest rate (including rent, house money, profit, etc.), the wage index, and the cost of living index. However, those details cannot be explained in a short time, so I will not talk about them. Fortunately, the theory that the wholesale price index is the best indicator of the domestic value of currency is almost universally accepted. Other indexes are only used for reference.</p>
<p>Once the standard to be adopted is determined, we must also consider a base period for stabilizing currency value. Should we stabilize China's price (that is, the domestic value of currency) at the level under the new monetary policy in 1935, or should we find another base period? This is certainly not something that an individual can answer correctly. This requires discussion by a majority of people to decide. I can only suggest a principle: this level should be able to represent a "normal development period" and should be beneficial and harmless to the general economy. What can meet this principle can be used as a standard for stabilizing prices. Since there are these two principles, it will not take much effort to obtain them.</p>

<h3>The Use of the Exchange Fund under the New Gold Standard</h3>
<p>— Bao Yuchi</p>
<p>Since the devaluation of the French franc, the three countries of England, the United States, and France have signed a currency agreement to jointly maintain the new gold standard: the heat wave of the international currency war has temporarily subsided. Recently, the exchange rate between the French franc and the US dollar has stabilized at around 21.40 francs, and the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar has also gradually approached 4.86 yuan. The stability of the pound, dollar, and franc is due to the intervention of the two governments. The use of the exchange fund is obvious, but the inside story of its activities has not been announced by the government.</p>
<p>At present, there are a total of four exchange funds, including the Netherlands, ready to operate in the international financial market. It is not known whether other countries will continue to weave them. However, under the new currency situation, the use of the exchange fund must also be transformed, changing to a new posture to promote international cooperation, so that the activities of the exchange funds of various countries are in sync, and the same good consequences occur for the domestic credit and banking system.</p>
<p>Taking the British exchange fund as an example, according to the provisions of the legislation, the acquisition of gold and foreign assets (referring to bills of exchange, etc.) is due to the sale of treasury bills. This is fundamentally different from the exchange funds of the United States and France, which are generated by revaluing the value of gold. Therefore, the important assets of the British exchange fund are treasury bills. The increase in gold and foreign assets in the fund account is the increase in the quantity of treasury bills sold, the increase in the supply in the market, or the increase in the amount of treasury bills held by banks; conversely, the decrease in gold and foreign assets in the fund account is of course the purchase of treasury bills. The UK uses this type of adjustment method to maintain the price, and the effect is quite good.</p>
<p>Suppose France withdraws 1 million pounds of funds from a bank in London, which will of course have a serious impact on the London market. At this time, the British exchange fund can do its best to intervene. Since France has withdrawn 1 million pounds of deposits, banks in England will inevitably purchase 10.5 million French francs with 1 million pounds to pay for it. The British exchange fund then purchases 10.5 million French francs with 1 million pounds of gold in the Paris market; and then sells it to the bank in the London market. The bank allocates 1 million pounds to the fund, so 1 million pounds is transferred from the bank's deposit account in England to the public deposit account. After receiving 1 million pounds in the fund account, treasury bills are purchased; the supply of treasury bills on the market is reduced by the same amount. The result is the expansion of the bank's cash amount. The bank still recovers 1 million pounds in cash, but will reduce treasury bills or lend 1 million pounds with treasury bills as collateral. The above situation can be better understood if expressed in the following simple table.</p>
<p>As a result of the above changes, bank deposits and treasury bills and short-term loans have decreased, and cash has not changed temporarily; the bank's cash ratio has increased, and it can increase loans and purchase securities. Therefore, the withdrawal of French funds from the London market and the loss of 2 million pounds of gold by the British exchange fund are enough to smooth the market's credit and reduce the bank's lending interest rate.</p>
<p>What is the impact on the Paris market? The 10.5 million French francs withdrawn from London are all transferred to commercial banks; the French authorities purchase gold worth 10.5 million French francs from the exchange fund and deposit it in the Bank of France, increasing its gold reserves. This 10.5 million French francs is sold by the British exchange fund to domestic banks and then paid by the banks to French commercial banks. French commercial banks then deposit it into the cash account of the Bank of France. Therefore, the bank deposits and cash of French banks increase at the same time. The Paris financial market is more flexible due to the return of funds.</p>
<p>The flow of international funds can have a consistent and positive impact due to the adjustment of the exchange funds of various countries. This is the benefit of the existence of the fund.</p>
<p>At present, although the three countries of England, the United States, and France have signed a currency agreement, and France has also established an exchange equalization fund; however, the use of the three countries' funds must be open and honest in technology and take consistent steps, so that the currencies of the three countries have hope of stability. If they still harbor different intentions and compete secretly, the international currency war will intensify and never end!</p>
<h3>Sudden Obstacles to Raw Silk Exports to France</h3>
<p>— Qian Tianda</p>
<p>(Continued from Issue 199)</p>
<p>Further, observing the countries to which our country exported raw silk last year, Shanghai alone exported a total of 55,007 bales (including 38,143 bales of white filature silk, 1,783 bales of yellow filature silk, 3,983 bales of Chekiang filature silk, 1,684 bales of white tussah silk, 1,691 bales of yellow silk, 3,147 bales of yellow tussah silk, 2,380 bales of gray silk, and 2,096 bales of duppion silk). Among them, 21,374 bales went to Europe. The so-called Europe is actually mostly France, because the amount of silk used by France accounts for about 70-80% of the total in Europe, and most of the Chinese silk exported to Europe is sold to France. The following table shows the countries to which our country exports raw silk, which can be clearly understood.</p>
<p>The above is only limited to the situation of white filature silk and yellow filature silk, but these two items account for the majority of Chinese silk exports. Other items such as yellow tussah silk, white tussah silk, and gray silk are not listed separately for the sake of saving space. In short, the huge amount of Chinese silk sold in France can be seen in general.</p>
<p>(3) The Impact of the French Franc Devaluation on Chinese Silk Exports</p>
<p>The unit of sale for raw silk in our country is calculated per hundred catties in domestic silk, such as each bale or picul being equal to a certain amount of yuan. The same is true in Japan. In the United States and the United Kingdom, it is calculated in pounds, such as the current price of standard silk in New York being 1.60 yuan per pound, which means that Chinese silk should be multiplied by 133 pounds (equivalent to one Chinese picul) and then divided by the exchange rate against the United States. French raw silk is measured in kilograms (that is, kilograms in our country's current standard system). Sixty kilograms are equal to one picul in our country. Before the French franc was devalued, the Chinese silk in the French market was assumed to be worth 60 French francs per kilogram. Sixty kilograms per picul should be 3,600 French francs. Converted at the exchange rate against France, 100 yuan in national currency is equal to 4,642.15 French francs (the exchange rate listed by the Central Bank on September 25), which should be worth more than 770 yuan in national currency. After deducting 50 yuan per picul for expenses, there are still more than 720 yuan. However, since the devaluation of the French franc, the French exchange rate has plummeted. Recently, the Central Bank listed the exchange rate at 630 French francs per 100 yuan in national currency. Then, the Chinese silk at 60 French francs per kilogram, which was originally worth more than 770 yuan per picul, is now only worth more than 540 yuan. After deducting 50 yuan for expenses, there are only more than 490 yuan left. Therefore, as a result of the devaluation of the French franc, the loss suffered by Chinese silk in exchange rates is at least about 200 yuan. If the price is not increased, the loss will be unbearable. However, if the price is increased, it will be difficult to sell, and the amount of exports to France is likely to decrease. Therefore, the devaluation of the French franc is a major blow to Chinese silk exports.</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, at the time of this French franc devaluation, there was an even more important measure, that is, France and the United Kingdom and the United States signed a currency agreement, and its devaluation component was also limited to balancing domestic and foreign prices, and it was not intended to be used to attack other countries by means of devaluation. Therefore, we believe that the devaluation of the French franc is a sign of the cessation of the world currency war. When the currency war ceases, the exchange rate will tend to stabilize, and the reduction of tariffs will also be initiated. (France, Italy, and other countries, after reducing their currency values ​​this time, followed by reducing import tariffs, and the United Kingdom and France also proposed to the Economic Committee of the League of Nations to abolish import quotas and exchange rate management systems, then in the near future, the realization of a tariff truce is certain.) If free trade is given another opportunity to raise its head, then world economic prosperity, and the consumption of raw silk, will naturally increase. Moreover, the raw silk market has now been transferred from Lyon to New York and Yokohama Kobe. We do not see that the recent price of French Chinese silk has risen with the rise of the Japanese and American silk markets. The price of B-grade Chinese silk has risen to 87 French francs per kilogram, equivalent to more than 800 yuan in national currency. The Lyon market cannot plummet when the American and Japanese silk markets are rising sharply. However, world economic prosperity and the recovery of international trade are still to be seen. The stagnation of the Lyon silk market and the reduction in consumption are also enough to affect the rise in prices in the Japanese and American markets. Therefore, the devaluation of the French franc may increase the consumption of raw silk in the future due to the recovery of world trade, but at present, due to the sudden change in exchange rate conversion, the export of raw silk to France is obviously hindered, especially Chinese raw silk, which is important for French sales, has been the most severely hit. To overcome this difficult situation, there is only one way to improve products, reduce production costs, and work hard to promote sales. If we can make good use of the opportunity, future development may be promising. If we cannot adapt to the times, then the arrival of the blow will only accelerate the date of decline.</p>

<h3>Securities: Weekly Government Bond Market Summary Shows Increase</h3>
<p>Last week, from November 2nd to 7th, the market conditions at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw considerable fluctuations, with a significant overall increase. Although the situation in North China had effectively deteriorated from tense to fractured, on the surface, things appeared more moderate. The seventh round of Sino-Japanese negotiations had yet to take place, leading to a rise in market prices. There were slight rumors regarding the political situation, as well as speculation about the issuance of a new 400 million yuan public bond, but none of these were confirmed. The market price continued to be volatile, fluctuating continuously without stability.</p>
<p>Looking back at the week, on Monday, there were rumors of improved relations between China and Japan, along with speculation about changes in the political situation. This caused a significant surge in market prices due to short covering, with increases ranging from 45 to 85 cents. On Tuesday, sudden rumors of military changes in eastern Suiyuan and Tianjin-Beijing caused people's confidence to waver, and market prices retreated by 35 to 50 cents. On Wednesday, trading gradually slowed down, and news was dull. There was some forward trading on the market, and market prices rebounded by 10 to 40 cents. On Thursday, trading was extremely quiet, and market prices were also very stagnant, trending slightly downward by 10 to 20 cents. On Friday, it was said that the two points insisted upon in Sino-Japanese negotiations would be discussed later, creating a suddenly strong atmosphere of reconciliation. Large and small investors alike rushed to buy, causing market prices to rise sharply, by as much as 50 cents to 85 cents. On Saturday, the situation was again not optimistic, with talk of gunfire in eastern Suiyuan. Those who had bought the previous day engaged in selling, causing prices to fall slightly by 15 to 45 cents.</p>
<p>The overall diplomatic atmosphere appeared favorable in words but contradictory in reality. As a result of the week's market activity, there was a consistent increase of 75 cents to 1.15 yuan. The total transaction volume was 39.47 million yuan. The following is a comparative table of the resulting increases and decreases (unit: yuan; transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Considerable Purchases of American Cotton Taking Advantage of Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with a drop of 1 to 4 points across various months. News from Liverpool was positive, and cloth sales were strong, but this was overturned by profit-taking and hedging. Traders bought in at the lower prices. The weather conditions, due to excessive cold, were very favorable, though not critically important. Before closing, cooperatives actively bought December contracts, along with short covering and trader purchases, causing market prices to rise suddenly. Spot prices increased by 8 points, and futures rose by 8 to 11 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures also rose by 3 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to profit-taking but rebounded due to positive news from Liverpool and purchases by European exporters. Pingoer fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Oomra fell by half a rupee, and Broach White fell by 0.25 rupee. The original telegram records are as follows (dated 7th):</p>
<p>Pingoer: 157.75, down 0.75, 27.80</p>
<p>March Futures: 158.15, down 1.00, 17.90</p>
<p>Oomra: 195.75, down 0.50, 24.60</p>
<p>March Futures: 195.70, down 0.50, 34.60</p>
<p>Broach White: 38.75, down 0.25, 38.80</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 9th is: Broach White at 219.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupee; Oomra at 196.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupee; Pingoer at 158.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupee.</p>
<h3>US Government Report Forecast</h3>
<p>New York, 7th: The fourth US cotton government report is scheduled to be released at noon on the 9th. Based on various private estimates, the predicted production is 11,867,000 bales, with 988,000 bales already ginned.</p>
<p>New York, 7th: The Coolican Bureau's current estimate is 11,811,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: Quanzhou Dried Longan Prices Inverted, Far Different from Shanghai Market</h3>
<p>Since the arrival of the third batch of Quanzhou large dried longans, no further shipments have arrived. According to express airmail news, the total volume of the fourth batch is over 3,000 pieces, which will soon be shipped to Shanghai by the Hua Ping. However, this time the cost is 3 to 4 yuan higher than before. Correspondents report that the top-grade large-kernel goods are nearly 40 yuan in Quanzhou. The inverted situation in the Shanghai market has already formed. Furthermore, recent sales in Shanghai have been lackluster, and merchants dare not eat up more. High prices are inevitable, and the future market may need to be supported. How actual sales go will determine the transition.</p>
<h3>Haikou Branch Prices Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>The prices of Haikou school and Shuidong branch goods had been stagnant for some time. The trading houses had not made any official deals due to slow sales, and the support was maintained. It is said that over 1,000 boxes had been traded privately, with quoted prices increasing by varying amounts of 40 to 50 cents. The trading houses still have 3,000 to 4,000 boxes in stock and have decided to officially open for business on Monday (today). According to telegrams from the production area, purchase prices are gradually rising, already exceeding those in the Shanghai market, so the future market price may need to rise again. Lanzhu has been arriving continuously in recent days, but the demand is limited, so the market situation has become stable. Since the price of golden You flattened branches and original branches has rebounded, the trend is firm and not easily loosened.</p>
<h3>Metals: Construction Trades Actively Purchasing US Square Nails</h3>
<p>Recently, construction trades from Nanking and Hankow have been actively purchasing US square nails, causing the market to sell remarkably well. However, incoming shipments are not continuous, and quoted prices are high, so the Shanghai market's prices have also soared. Currently, the market price is 14 yuan per barrel, more than 1 yuan higher than before. Some single-drum prices have even opened at 16 yuan or more, demonstrating the market's briskness.</p>
<h3>Grain: River Rice Supply Exceeds Demand, Market Prices Tend to Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups surged, with over 100 boats arriving, carrying over 20,000 piculs of rice. This immediately deflated market sentiment. The local sales market was stagnant, and although the packaging costs were flat, groups from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai purchased 1,200 to 1,300 packages of thick粳 and 6,000 to 7,000 packages of thin稻, but ultimately the supply exceeded demand. The market was difficult to stabilize. As a result, the price of thick粳 depreciated by nearly 10 cents, and high-quality thin稻 fell by 23 cents. Medium-quality rice fell by 18 cents. Considering the overall trend, if the sources continue to surge, there is a risk of continued downward movement. Sales of Du Yang tip and 到 were balanced, with no significant market fluctuations. New 阴元 presented a stable-to-tired situation, and New 变元 fell by 10 to 20 cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of boats arriving from various routes down the river surged, with approximately 51 to 52 boats. The market still saw sluggish demand, and the price of new粳 rice was slightly down by 3 to 4 cents. The packaging cost of thin稻 was stagnant. The local market was weak, with prices slightly down by nearly 10 cents. The price of Yang Du Pu tip was slightly down by a few cents. Demand for 客 tip was poor, and prices were loosening. The price of 变元 was stable and tight. There had been a shortage of 阴元 for several days, so the price was firm. The arrival of early rice was also scarce, and the demand was active, so the price was firm and tight.</p>

<p>Couple's Knowledge</p>
<p>— Authored by German Medical Doctor Zhang Junshi</p>
<h3>Marriage and a Healthy Sexual Life</h3>
<p>A strong and sexually healthy husband is the ideal partner for the new woman. Sexual dysfunction completely negates the ideal partner for the new woman, often leading to marital discord and divorce. Wishing to remedy this regret in the realm of love, how few wonderful methods does the medical field possess to lead you to paradise on earth?</p>
<p>The so-called idealized love—pure spiritual love—is merely a beautiful name used for self-consolation by those who have failed in love. Truly complete love inevitably culminates in the union of both man and woman. In addition to spiritual resonance, marriage is the opening act of sexual life between husband and wife. A healthy sexual life is the sole bond that maintains the affection between husband and wife. Sexual life is by no means the one-sided joy of the man but the mutual satisfaction of both man and woman.</p>
<p>The era of the pale-faced scholar is over. What the new woman needs is not airy-fairy love but something solid and forceful. Only a husband with a healthy sexual side can make a woman become infatuated with his embrace.</p>
<p>If the physique is weak and sexual function is unhealthy, the couple will only feel a faint dissatisfaction. The woman will never be intoxicated in her husband's arms, and the flames of love will be doused with a cold water, how can they not extinguish and wither away?</p>
<p>A wife who despises her husband and does not enjoy marital bliss will naturally firmly seek a divorce in today's progressive and enlightened society.</p>
<p>Such a man is truly pitiable. The paradise of life is closed to him, forcing him to wander along a gray path, recalling the origins of his pain.</p>
<p>Some: In their youth, filled with thoughts of admiring young girls, they indulge in daydreams, and then are stirred up, seeking satisfaction through masturbation. As a result, the reproductive glands, which are developing rapidly, are damaged by premature and excessive use. The spirit and body also lose a large amount of energy. Diseases such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and impotence become like bamboo shoots after a rain, springing up everywhere.</p>
<p>Some: Marry too early and indulge in lust without restraint, resulting in the same diseases as mentioned above. Still others: Have a fondness for wandering and associating with casual acquaintances, leading to infection with gonorrhea, which in turn induces symptoms of sexual neurasthenia.</p>
<p>For these people, the only thing that can truly remedy this regret in the realm of love is the drug "Organotherapy," invented by Austrian Dr. Steinach. He has spent two or thirty years of research, extracting gonadal hormones from strong animals and refining them into medicine using scientific methods. Therefore, it is truly effective in improving reproductive gland function and is the only good medicine for sexual neurasthenia. Once the reproductive glands are healthy and strong, local development can also be fully achieved, and diseases such as impotence and premature ejaculation will naturally disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>For those suffering from nocturnal emission, simultaneously applying "Dr. Schimitt's Spermatorrhea Pills," prepared by German Dr. Schimitt, will immediately stop nocturnal emission. For those suffering from gonorrhea, simultaneously taking "Antilympha," a combination of flavin and vaccine, will eliminate gonococcal bacteria inside and outside the mucous membranes of the urethra. In this way, all diseases will be cured, and one will definitely become a strong and sexually healthy husband.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The genuine "Organotherapy" is generally packaged in iron boxes.)</p>
<p>Therapeutic Guidance</p>
<h3>Eliminate the Source of Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— American University of Pennsylvania Medical Doctor Yao Erchang</p>
<p>... contributing a fundamental solution for treatment ... eliminating dampness, expelling wind, strengthening the body, and eliminating gonorrhea, none are dispensable.</p>
<p>Seven or eight out of ten bone pain sufferers are middle-aged or older. Those young adults who suffer from this disease are generally extremely weak. The reason is that the sources of bone pain are nothing more than overwork, unrestrained lust, internal dampness, infection with gonorrhea, etc. People who are physically strong and full of energy have sufficient resistance, so disease demons have no way to sneak in. Once you are weak and old, they take the opportunity to mix in and become highly active.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot help but have deep doubts about general methods of treating bone pain. General methods commit the mistake of "treating the head when the head hurts, and treating the foot when the foot hurts," focusing solely on preventing bone pain. As a result, although they may be effective temporarily, they soon come back with a vengeance. Moreover, the efficacy of these ordinary drugs is not very reliable, even for treating bone pain specifically.</p>
<p>The best treatment must take a two-pronged approach. "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills," which have great efficacy in dispelling dampness, expelling wind, clearing blood, and stopping pain in five aspects, should be taken orally by the patient to sweep the uric acid in the blood clean. Naturally, one will feel light and healthy, and the pain will stop. On the other hand, we must also directly address the source of the disease and eliminate the possibility of recurrence. The possibilities that cause bone pain are nothing more than weakness and gonorrhea. For weakness, patients should take "Organotherapy" to promote the secretion of the gonads, so that energy can be abundant, and even if disease demons want to attack, the strong resistance can always repel them. For gonorrhea, only the flavin-vaccine combination "Antilympha" can be taken orally, with the power to sweep away all gonococci and increase anti-toxic strength. Being able to treat in this way is like uprooting weeds, which can permanently eliminate future troubles. Those suffering from this disease should know this.</p>
<p>Sex Education for Youth</p>
<h3>A Comprehensive View of the Harms of Masturbation Leading to Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>... The onset of spring passion is the first step for young people to undertake the mission of reproducing mankind ... Physical changes, mental troubles, and tension in certain parts of the body are all discovered.</p>
<p>The period of youth for men is from the age of fifteen to twenty-five, transitioning from childhood to adult life, so we call it the period of youth. In this period of youth, young people are also introduced to changes in the brain and physique, which will make up the first phase of this period. Or walking to the first step of adulthood, we call it the "onset of spring passion." This onset of spring passion has a time of two or three years, usually from the age of sixteen to eighteen. During this period, young people can produce a large amount of semen to take on the mission of completing the reproduction of mankind. It is to recognize that young people have reached the stage of reproductive development in their development. The foundation of future health and well-being is completely laid in this period. However, this period is full of errors and dangers. Physical changes, mental troubles, and tension in certain parts of the body can all trigger mistakes and fall into the dark traps of youth. The most obvious of these is that, with the development of sexual organs and the rise of lust, one is prone to masturbation addiction internally, and one is prone to making mistakes and being tempted by the environment, destroying the virginity of youth, which certainly requires full attention!</p>
<p>According to research by the majority of medical scholars: More than 90% of young people will commit the bad habit of masturbation once they reach the appropriate age. Sagacious parents must carefully observe whether their children, who have reached the appropriate age, are playing with masturbation, whether the motive is due to temptation, or whether it occurs unintentionally. If they really know that they have committed this bad habit, it goes without saying that they must be given appropriate instruction. At this time, if it is discovered that they have been harmed, they should quickly use the method of consolidating the semen barrier and apply active treatment, which will have significant effects.</p>
<p>Regarding the symptoms of nocturnal emission that erupt after masturbation, there are various claims about its harms. Observing from a medical perspective, in addition to spermatorrhea, it can prevent the development of sexual organs. It can also lead to sexual neurasthenia, such as impotence and premature ejaculation. Therefore, the scope of its harm is indeed deep and great.</p>
<p>The best way to remedy this harm is to quickly take "Dr. Schimitt's Spermatorrhea Pills." This medicine can not only consolidate the semen barrier and stop nocturnal emission but also make your will strong and your desires pure. After nocturnal emission stops, all the symptoms of weakness caused by nocturnal emission, such as forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, and sexual neurasthenia such as impotence, premature ejaculation, and incomplete development, should be treated with the gonadal hormone preparation "Organotherapy," and all kinds of harms can be completely cured.</p>
<p>Sex Disease Lecture</p>
<p>— Jointly Edited by Dr. Yao Erchang and Physician Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road. Outpatient hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Impotence Caused by Masturbation</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Daren, 25 years old, from Hangzhou. Chief complaint—Born healthy, not knowing illness, medium build, good nutrition. Unfortunately, at the age of seventeen, when he had just developed, he indulged in masturbation. This led to frequent nocturnal emissions, and the bad habit of masturbation increased day by day. How could a strong body withstand unlimited emissions? It was not until he got married at the age of twenty-three that he was able to quit this bad habit, but he was already exhausted. Therefore, during intercourse, the sexual organ became erect but not firm, and he could hardly engage in full intercourse. Recently, it has become increasingly worse, as he has completely lost his sexual function. Although he knew it was due to masturbation, there was another reason he had to tell, Zhang also suffered from congenital phimosis. Only a tiny small hole was exposed for urination. Therefore, even when using his fingers to turn back the foreskin, the glans could not be exposed. (Treatment method)—First, local anesthesia was applied, and a small amount of the constricted area at the tip of the foreskin was cut off, forming a ring. Suturing was completed in 0.30 minutes. The process was completely painless. Zhang's disease originated from the destruction of the reproductive glands, leading to damage and loosening of the semen barrier. In addition to taking "Organotherapy," a good medicine for strengthening the reproductive glands, to restore their function, he was also given "Dr. Schimitt's Spermatorrhea Pills," a special medicine for consolidating the semen barrier and stopping nocturnal emission. Furthermore, he was given electrotherapy every month, and his prostate was massaged. After a month, his sexual function had improved, and nocturnal emission had stopped. After taking it for two months, not only did all his diseases disappear, but his energy was also particularly abundant, and his appetite was abnormally increased. The most obvious thing was the increase in weight, and the length of the sexual organ suddenly increased by six points.</p>
<p>(2) Effective Remedy for Early Marriage and Childlessness</p>
<p>Patient Bao Yongren, 29 years old, from Chaoxian County, Anhui. Chief complaint—Has been married for eleven years and has not yet had children. His parents married him off at the age of eighteen because they doted on him. The patient was their only son. Moreover, his parents were both nearly fifty years old when he was born, so he was inevitably born with insufficient congenital endowment. In addition, he entered sexual life before development was completed. Therefore, after marriage, he suffered from premature ejaculation. Moreover, his wife's body was also weak, and her menstruation was often irregular. Therefore, the cause of infertility was the fault of both parties. (Treatment method)—It was diagnosed that Bao's sexual organs were small. In addition to making him strictly adhere to the principles of health preservation, he was given "Organotherapy" for men to increase sexual power and restore development. And the "Organotherapy" for women was given to his wife, so that her menstruation was adjusted and her reproductive function was enhanced. After two months, Bao's development improved, and his sexual function increased. His wife's menstruation was accurate, and she is now pregnant this autumn.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Jingshi from Shuizhou's Water Pond Lane writes: His wife's body is inherently weak, so her menstruation is irregular, and she has a lot of leukorrhea. She has suffered from the above two symptoms for four years, and although she has been treated in many ways, she has had very little effect. Then this summer, she purchased "Organotherapy" for women to regulate menstruation and "Leukorrhea Relief" for external use to stop leukorrhea, and her previous illnesses were completely cured.</p>
<h3>Rescue from Stomach Pain</h3>
<p>Editor: The suffering of the stomach is really difficult to describe. I unfortunately suffered from it for three years. I know that I have this disease entirely due to improper diet and a preference for eating raw and cold things. This summer, after a friend introduced me to "Stomach Pain Relief," I was cured. At the same time, because my appetite was poor, I also took "Stomach Strengthening Element." Now, in half a year, not only has my stomach pain never recurred, but my appetite has been enhanced, and my body is stronger than ever before. (Luo Minyou)</p>
<h3>Radical Cure for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>Sir: I unfortunately suffered from blennorhea. In the beginning, I mistakenly took a certain combination preparation advertised with false claims, and therefore it turned from acute to chronic. It has been three years in total. Now, fortunately, I was instructed by a fellow patient about the merits of combination preparations. I purchased "Antilympha," a combination preparation of flavin and vaccine. This is truly effective. After taking three boxes, I was completely cured. (Xu Jingcheng)</p>
<h3>Beginning to Know About Fake Drugs</h3>
<p>Editor: Today, I learned from the news column of major Shanghai newspapers on November 4 that the Da Dong Pharmacy was arrested by the police for counterfeiting "Organotherapy" and "Dr. Schimitt's Spermatorrhea Pills." I now know that the paper-boxed and bottled ones I bought last month were the fake goods. After taking them, they had no effect whatsoever. I then pointed to and purchased the genuine goods of the above two medicines in iron box packaging. Since taking them, only five days have passed, and I already feel the effects are obvious. The harm of fake drugs is truly not small. (Wang Chengde, Changzhou)</p>
<p>Common Sense on Quitting Smoking</p>
<h3>Where Will Those Who Fail to Quit Smoking Go?</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>We do not need to shed tears of sympathy for smokers who do not think of freeing themselves and willingly violate criminal law. However, another group of smokers who find themselves in prison cannot help but make people feel deeply sorry. They have long felt exhausted by the burden of smoking and are eager to quit as soon as possible, but because they have tried repeatedly and failed, they have dragged on until now.</p>
<p>For this group of people, we in the medical profession are willing to contribute the safest and most reliable tonic method of quitting smoking to free them from danger. This method is the only smooth path that those who have tried other methods and failed can take.</p>
<p>Think about it: Why do those who quit smoking using ordinary methods always suffer from pain and discomfort and start smoking again? Naturally, it is because the toxins of tobacco have penetrated into all parts of the body, anesthetizing all its cells, so that they cannot move without being stimulated by tobacco. Therefore, after stopping or reducing the amount of tobacco, the lack of stimulation causes endocrine and metabolic functions to enter a state of stagnation, and they become painful and unbearable.</p>
<p>The tonic method of quitting smoking starts from this aspect. It makes quitters take the gonadal hormone preparation "Organotherapy" in iron boxes to promote the secretion of the gonads, the source of life, so that physical strength is abundant, stimulating the operation of all the tissues of the body, so that quitters do not need the stimulation of tobacco. The body then produces new life strength to resist the toxins of tobacco. Therefore, it is possible to quit without pain. Usually, it only takes four or five weeks to quit, and one will never think of smoking again.</p>
<p>Patient Min Weicai, 44 years old, has been smoking since he was 15, almost 30 years. He has tried various prescriptions before and quit four times, but not only did he give up halfway each time, but his smoking amount increased as a result. Recently, seeing that the prohibition on tobacco and medicine is becoming stricter every day, and his personal economic strength is not generous, continuing to smoke makes him feel fear and heavy burden. Therefore, he planned to try to quit again. After I gave him a large amount of "Organotherapy" in iron boxes, his 30-year-old addiction was removed after a month and a half. His complexion was rosy, and his physical strength improved.</p>
<h3>Public Opinion on Health: Causes and Treatment of Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The outbreak of bone pain is entirely due to the gradual decline of the person's constitution. Although everyone cannot avoid aging and death, many people age before reaching the appropriate age. The most obvious sign of aging is the onset of bone pain. This syndrome includes several diseases, from soreness in the lower back to pain in the joints of the whole body, numbness in the hands and feet, and even hemiplegia, stroke, and death! However, the evolution of this syndrome follows a fixed and unchangeable path. For example, after prolonged soreness in the lower back, either ignoring treatment or improper treatment will inevitably spread to the whole body. If it worsens again, hemiplegia is unavoidable, and even the risk of life occurs because of this.</p>
<p>Regarding the causes that promote this syndrome, there is internal dampness and unclean blood. In addition, there is arteriosclerosis. Therefore, the most reliable treatment must be to take "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills" because the medicine is truly effective in dispelling wind, eliminating dampness, clearing blood toxins, and preventing arteriosclerosis. After taking it, the joints immediately feel relaxed, and recovery is very rapid.</p>
<p>Patient Hu Guowen, only 35 years old, completely accumulated wind dampness in his early years and had unclean blood in his middle age, so he had long suffered from lower back pain. Due to improper treatment, it spread to the whole body, and he fell into a state of hemiplegia during the onset, which was unspeakable suffering. After being introduced by a friend to take "Strongston's Bone Pain Pills," he took three boxes in a row, and the disease was radically cured.</p>
<p>Childbearing and Beauty</p>
<h3>Healthy, Strong Children Require Healthy, Beautiful Mothers</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine from the University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Who wouldn't want their children to be healthy, strong, lively, and adorable? However, only healthy, beautiful mothers can produce such children. How can sickly women with pale complexions, thin muscles, flat breasts, and irregular menstruation produce healthy, strong children?</p>
<p>Furthermore, such women not only find it difficult to bear healthy babies, but they also lose their beauty. They have no chance of possessing graceful curves, prominent breasts, or rosy complexions. The inevitable result is thinness and ugliness.</p>
<p>Regarding the reasons for infertility, apart from contracting gonorrhea, causes include irregular menstruation, a deficiency in ovarian endocrine secretion (i.e., gonadotropin), and excessive leucorrhea, leading to the loss of reproductive function.</p>
<p>Besides taking reliable medicines to achieve health and beauty, they have no other way to give birth to healthy, strong children.</p>
<p>The best medicine is the gonadotropin preparation "Female Gonadotropin," which can perfect development, make the breasts prominent, the curves complete, and the skin plump and beautiful. It can also cure irregular menstruation and other conditions. Dr. Steinach, the creator, has treated over 30,000 women with flat breasts in Vienna, Austria this year. Participants in beauty contests around the world often take this medicine and rank at the top.</p>
<p>For excessive leucorrhea, use the external medication "Liao Dai Ling" as a suppository to cleanse the vaginal passage. Those infected with gonorrhea should take the combination preparation of "Anti-Gonorrhea," a combination of vaccine and xanthophyll, which can penetrate the membrane to kill bacteria without harming the stomach or intestines and has no side effects. These medicines are truly effective and are a godsend for women. Women who are weak, infertile, or interested in beauty should pay attention to them.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>"Corsage Flowers" and "Donations"</h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>Guangzhou is the birthplace of the revolution, but it has recently become the main camp for restoring the old ways. Practices such as "la modeng" (embracing modernity) and studying ancient books, as well as separate swimming for men and women, almost all originated there. Even if someone else gets there first and initiates something, people don't dare to lag behind and quickly respond. This response is sincere, so there is no regional bias (now that there is unification, it is of course an exception). Sometimes, they even work harder than the initiators.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of prostitutes wearing "corsage flowers," it is not clear when this started in Guangzhou. However, more recently, in places like Nanjing, there seems to have been a "peach blossom badge" incident. The reason why singing girls and prostitutes opposed wearing "peach blossom badges" was that singing girls and prostitutes are also human beings, and everyone has a sense of shame. Wearing a "peach blossom badge" clearly tells everyone their "identity." This is unacceptable! On the other hand, asking them to wear "peach blossom badges" was originally intended to distinguish them from "respectable women," so the reason put forward by the former is insufficient. What is the current outcome? It seems there is no conclusion. Fortunately, this is irrelevant to this article, and there is no need to pursue it further. What the newspaper tells us is that prostitutes in Guangzhou are required to wear, and are wearing, "corsage flowers."</p>
<p>Recently, prostitutes in Guangzhou can also have "exceptions." According to a Guangzhou correspondent for the Big Evening News, "In order to reward enthusiastic prostitutes, the fundraising committee has stipulated that if each prostitute can solicit donations of 50 yuan or more, they will be allowed to be exempt from wearing corsage flowers for six months as an encouragement."</p>
<p>Prostitutes are also human beings. Fundraising to purchase aircraft for national defense is the duty of every citizen and is something that cannot be shirked. It is natural to reward those who are enthusiastic, but it is hoped that they will not be treated as outsiders by using donations as the price for removing their "identification." Otherwise, on the surface, it is "to encourage," but in essence, they are still not treated as "people." This seems to deviate slightly from the original intention—although this has been going on for a long time, why bother revealing this again when "encouraging" them?</p>
<p>Using a donation of 50 yuan as the price for "exemption from wearing corsage flowers for six months" may be more effective than without conditions, but unfortunately, if this is true, then it is no longer a manifestation of enthusiasm for the country but has become a "donation to purchase rank" in nature. If this is the case, the prostitutes, who have always been regarded as lowly by the gentlemen, may be excused for wanting to "raise their status," but for the members of the fundraising committee, this irony is too great!</p>
<p>I was born too late, so I don't know much about the Qing Dynasty's system of purchasing rank with donations. However, the psychology of those who purchased rank can be guessed. They wanted to use the power of money to raise their status or use it as a tool for collecting money in the future. From a rational point of view, "purchasing rank" and donations should be absolutely different.</p>
<p>Today's society divides people into various levels and allows them to use money to elevate themselves, so they can stand a little higher. This method is ingenious, but it's a bit "that way" when it comes to the saying that "all people are equal."</p>
<p>Or perhaps, in the minds of upright gentlemen, prostitutes have never been regarded as "people." Now, to do this... that is truly the nature of a gentleman. If that is true, then there is a different argument.</p>
<p>However, even prostitutes, who are regarded as lowly by upright gentlemen, are sometimes still useful to them.</p>

<h3>Submerged</h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>The kitchen, which had been empty for over half a month under the building, has been occupied by a family.</p>
<p>There are three people in this family: a tall man around thirty years old, thin and lanky, with a dry, dark complexion, who speaks in a low voice, as if from his nostrils, with a heavy smoking addiction; a plump woman around seventeen or eighteen years old, with two thick braids; and a little girl around twelve or thirteen years old, with short hair, wearing a patched-up floral qipao, her face often reddened with red paper.</p>
<p>These mysterious people are almost never at home during the day. Early in the morning, we can hear the little girl sleepily walking in the corridor outside the room, busily cooking rice in a broken iron pot. The young woman shrinks in a corner like a lump of meat, sleeping. The middle-aged man, with his body bent like a large lobster, is busy swallowing smoke. Once the rice is cooked, the three of them divide it and eat it. Then, the middle-aged man takes down his broken huqin from the wall, the little girl brings out a cloth package from under the bed and carries it on her back, and the young woman, as if she has never been happy, pouts and waves her hand, following them from a distance, heading towards the street.</p>
<p>They have to find a clearing in a lively place, where they all stand. Then the little girl takes off the package from her back, opens it, and takes out a large red robe, a fake beard, or a paper mask. The middle-aged man plays the huqin, and the young woman claps bamboo clappers in response. The little girl raises her voice and sings sadly. Before long, people crowd around, surrounding them densely, and the so-called "comical Beijing opera" begins.</p>
<p>Almost every day, around seven o'clock, we can see them returning like a group of ghosts, dragging their tired bodies. As usual, the little girl is at the tap, washing rice and vegetables, which are almost certainly scavenged from the garbage heap. Before they can even eat, the quarreling begins. First, the young woman stirs the thin rice porridge in her bowl with chopsticks, slams it on the table, and shouts angrily:</p>
<p>"You have no conscience, making us eat this food that's worse than pig slop!..."</p>
<p>The middle-aged man puts down his bowl, glances at her sternly, and shakes his head, saying:</p>
<p>"It's not my fault, business is bad!..."</p>
<p>"Business, business, you always say it's business, then where does the money we earn every day go?..." She stands up angrily, walks to the window, and stands there, her eyes flashing with anger, "We're starving, but you're leisurely smoking opium..."</p>
<p>"A Yuan, watch your tongue..." the middle-aged man says, somewhat flustered.</p>
<p>"That time, what did you tell me yourself..." She ignores him. "Let's go to Shanghai, I'll make sure you live a good life there." You forced me to leave my parents behind and come to Shanghai with you, but what's happening now? You're making me lose face in front of everyone, begging from people, you tricked me..."</p>
<p>She cries sadly, constantly thinking of her parents and fields in her hometown.</p>
<p>This stabs him like the tip of an arrow. At this time, he becomes very afraid of bringing up the past. Not only did he break his promise to her, but he also tricked the little girl. When he abducted her from a secluded place, he said the same thing to her, but can he be blamed? Hunger forces him!…</p>
<p>So he becomes a little desperate, silently stands up, waves his hands, and goes out.</p>
<p>On the road, he calmly thinks, reviewing his past and future. His thoughts become very confused. Suddenly, a thought crosses his mind, causing his whole body to tremble.</p>
<p>Around ten o'clock, he comes back, his face showing excitement and gentleness. He shakes the young woman awake and tells her in a low voice:</p>
<p>"A Yuan, I thought about it for a while, and I feel like I can't keep you here anymore. You don't want to live like this anyway. I want to send you home..."</p>
<p>She looks at him in surprise. It's too sudden. However, she believes that this might be true. So, her mind conjures up her parents and fields in her hometown again. She nods excitedly and grabs his hand. The next day, she is taken away by a fat man. In the following days, the middle-aged man and the little girl also move away.</p>
<p>About half a month later, one night, I was passing by the entrance of the Great World when I suddenly felt a hand gently tugging at the corner of my clothes behind me. I turned around, and it was the young woman. She seemed to recognize me, her face flushed, and she hesitantly withdrew her hand, tears slowly welling up in her eyes.</p>
<p>Even from a distance, I could still see her standing there vacantly. I think she has been deceived again and will be submerged forever.</p>
<h3>On the Platform</h3>
<p>— Han Longchen</p>
<h3>Staying Overnight in a Small Inn</h3>
<p>— Guo Ka</p>
<p>—Random Memories of Drifting About</p>
<p>One winter, on a snowy night, I got off the train at a small station along the Jiaoji Railway Line. In the dark street, a man took my small luggage, and I followed him to a small inn. The lamp in front of the inn's door, like a drowsy eye opening in the haze, sleepily looked at every arriving guest.</p>
<p>When the innkeeper saw six or seven guests coming in, he said with a hiss while holding a water pipe:</p>
<p>"Guests, this way."</p>
<p>So we all crowded into a room with a heated kang.</p>
<p>The inn servant brought two basins of hot water, and the six or seven strangers politely offered each other to wash:</p>
<p>"Please, you wash first!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, please, please!"</p>
<p>"You go first, you go first!"</p>
<p>As a result of the offers, I was the last to wash. Everyone brought a face full of dust from different places, all washed in these two small basins. It's not hard to imagine its dark, oily color! I closed my eyes and washed my face as best as I could, then we were assigned rooms. I was led to a small room in the inner courtyard.</p>
<p>When I went in, there were already two young men inside. Although the two were the same age, they had different styles. One was a genuine middle school student, chubby, wearing a checkered woolen coat, looking very rich. Later, when we talked, I learned that his family had real estate and rental accounting houses far away in Jinan. He had the same air as all wealthy young men, liked to talk about this and that, but never mentioned his studies. The other was a shop apprentice, clever and petty, carrying many miscellaneous things, looking like he was going home for the New Year. They were both eating snacks, one was eating sponge cake, and the apprentice was eating dumplings that he had ordered from outside. He complained about the dumplings while eating.</p>
<p>The room was quite cold. At this time, the inn servant temporarily lit a briquette stove, and the wood crackled. The room was filled with coal smoke, making people squint their eyes and not dare to breathe freely. While lighting the stove, he said, as if comforting the aggrieved guests, "The smoke is warm!"</p>
<p>After a while, we packed up to sleep. There was a large wooden bed in the room, occupying about two-thirds of the entire room, with a thin mattress on top. The mattress was dark blue, with a greasy shine on it. We hoped that the snow would stop the next day so that we could take the bus again, so everyone's luggage was not unpacked. The three of us lay together on this cold, hard bed.</p>
<p>While packing up to sleep, these three strangers started talking. Before long, they became familiar with each other. The shop apprentice said with a little regret:</p>
<p>"There are a few delicate prostitutes in this city. If it weren't snowing, I'd take you guys to have some fun!"</p>
<p>I found it a bit funny. The middle school student asked him all sorts of questions. After listening to the shop apprentice's stories about this small city, he also boasted about the Pingkang Lane of Jinan and so on.</p>
<p>I lay there, unable to sleep. I sat up and looked out through the cracks in the window. It seemed that it was still snowing, so I was very worried that the bus wouldn't be able to run tomorrow.</p>
<p>A mule in the courtyard shook its head from time to time, and the copper bell on its neck rang sadly.</p>
<h3>Old Miner</h3>
<p>— Rui Zhi</p>
<p>Before dawn, the shift change whistle hadn't sounded yet, but the news of the layoff had already spread through the thatched huts lining the hillside. The news came like thunder. Except for those who were still working underground, everyone felt uneasy. Usually, everyone hated the shift change whistle sounding too early and preventing them from resting longer in bed, but today, everyone got up restlessly without the whistle calling them. In less than half an hour, the entrance of the mine office was crowded with people, all looking up at the two large lists of names on the wall by the gate.</p>
<p>Ah Cheng, a miner who had been working in the mine for nearly twenty years, was also squeezed into the crowd at this time. Perhaps because he was older and weaker, he was sweating all over but still couldn't squeeze to the front. Seeing that the second whistle was about to sound, he finally managed to squeeze to the front. At this time, he also looked up at the list, a pair of flowery eyes that had lost their sharp vision, trying their best to focus, searching for his name. After all, he was old, and his eyes had lost their effectiveness. Not only could he not find his own name, but he couldn't even see other people's names clearly. This made him ask the people next to him who were also watching, but everyone was equally anxious. At this time, who wasn't paying attention to themselves? So no one answered Ah Cheng's questions, which made him even more anxious. Just by accident, he was squeezed out again, but this time, Ah Cheng discovered another place to hear the news, which was next to the hoist, where a contractor was reading the names to the illiterate workers.</p>
<p>"Old Cheng, don't bother looking. Your name is connected with mine. A total of more than five hundred people have been laid off. So unlucky!"</p>
<p>Ah Cheng had just started to walk towards the hoist when Xiao Jin, who lived with him, squeezed out of the crowd and said to Ah Cheng. His face was very pale and dejected.</p>

<p>All branches of the Shanghai Post Office can accept registered express airmail items and handle remittance savings and other businesses</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>"Your name is connected with mine." This sentence was like thunder, deafening Ah Cheng's ears. The footsteps he was just about to take stopped, and his eyes stared blankly as if he had just woken up from a dream.</p>
<p>Ah Cheng had the longest history of working in the mine. Among the three thousand or so workers, he was an old miner. In the past twenty years, he had experienced countless changes in the mine, and layoffs had occurred countless times, but he had never encountered one. Even ten years ago, when a fire broke out in the tunnel, killing hundreds of people, he had escaped danger, but this time, unexpectedly, his name appeared on the list.</p>
<p>The third shift change whistle sounded, and the people at the office gate gradually dispersed, some still smiling, some with sad faces. Although Ah Cheng had heard Xiao Jin's report, he still didn't quite believe it. When there were fewer people, he walked forward again, carefully paying attention to every word, and finally found the words "Ah Cheng." At this time, the workers who had finished their work and were coming out of the tunnel heard the news and walked towards the gate in groups again. Ah Cheng had no choice but to drag his heavy steps home. As he walked, he thought, thinking of his youth when he first came to work twenty years ago, thinking of his wife and children who still needed him to send money home to eat, thinking of his future life, thinking that he was already over forty years old. His heart thought of everything, thought of what he could no longer think of. He ran into the thatched hut and lay down on the wooden bed without a word. At this time, Xiao Jin looked at him and said:</p>
<p>"Old Cheng, you can go to the company to get your money in the afternoon! You're better off than me, you have two months' wages to take! Damn it, it's better for me to go to Shanghai and pull a rickshaw than to eat coal dust here every day."</p>
<p>Xiao Jin's words made Ah Cheng even more sad. He knew that he had no other way to make a living. Xiao Jin and the others could pull rickshaws, they were still young, but he had already wasted his youthful strength, his lifeblood, in the work of the past twenty years for the sake of a daily living expense of fifty cents. Two months' wages were only thirty yuan. How would he live on this little bit of money? Thinking of this, his heart changed from sadness to anger. He no longer resented his fate, nor did he resent his old age and incompetence. He only resented the work that had sucked his blood, the people who enjoyed the majority of the price of his twenty years of work. He knew that his layoff was because he was no longer a productive part of the machine.</p>

<p>A father who abandoned his wife and three children and ran away with his mistress for twenty years, when he is unable to work and is old, lowers his head again and wants to run into his son's house to eat ready-made meals.</p>
<p>The old wife, when she was young, hated her husband very much for disregarding his wife's life and only caring about his own enjoyment. However, when she got old, her heart softened. She saw her husband return old and tattered, and she shed tears of pity. In the minds of the son and daughter, the father's influence on them is fundamentally very vague. The return of the father and the mother's harmony with him naturally made them feel a little happy.</p>
<p>However, the eldest son, who had suffered a lot because he had no father when he was young, now supports the whole family with his hard work. He remembered the bitter days after his father left and saw that his father had returned to eat ready-made meals, and he was a little unwilling.</p>
<p>Therefore, the son denied his father's right to enter his home. No! That's because the father simply didn't fulfill his responsibilities.</p>

<p>A romantic scholar was exiled to Huangzhou. Every day, he enjoyed himself by the river. On the fifteenth day of the ninth month of Renxu, he spoke with two or three close friends. He went together gracefully on a boat on the Red Cliff. Soon the moon rose from the eastern mountain. Leaning on the railing, he lingered and looked at the Big Dipper. He struck the strings and made a beat, singing about the bright moon. He frequently filled his cup with wine. The guest harmonized with the xiao flute, the sound and rhythm were deep. The guest was a Taoist from Western Sichuan. He blew the flute so softly. Harmonizing with the rhythm quietly. It was as if a widow was weeping in a lonely boat. I sighed for Cao Mengde of that year. Composing poetry and holding a spear, he enjoyed himself leisurely. He went down to Jiangling. Breaking through Jingzhou. The axle and pulley stretched for a thousand miles, following the smooth wind. Indeed, he was a hero of his time. But I don't know where he is now. Thirty-six thousand days easily pass. How fortunate is life, like a mayfly. But you must see through false fame and gain. Talking about poverty and success, I am also ashamed. Wash the cups, drink the wine. The dishes are messed up and not free. We shared a pillow and mat on a small boat.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union 19th National Day Commemoration: "Shanghai" Screening "Construction of the Soviet Union"</h3>
<p>The seventh of this month is the 19th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Union. The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association is showing the film "Construction of the Soviet Union" at the Shanghai Grand Theatre to show its celebration, and Mr. Cai Yuanpei will give a speech. "Construction of the Soviet Union" is a documentary that tells us that the entire Soviet Union is actively under construction. Every scene makes people believe that "the Soviet Union is working for the happiness of mankind." (Speech by Mr. Li Zhaoluo). The content is now introduced below.</p>
<p>The industry of the proletarian state is developing at an unprecedented speed in human history. In 1936, 14.05 million tons of iron were produced, 16 million tons of cast steel, 12.02 million tons of steel bars, 135 million tons of coal, 238.58 million cubic meters of wood, 858,060 tons of paper, and 31,000 machines were manufactured. The total power of the locomotives manufactured in 1936 was 2.3 million horsepower.</p>
<p>The vast territories of the Soviet state are connected by new road and canal networks. After the Volga River and Moscow River are connected next year, the continental capital of Moscow will become a port for five seas.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of farmers have reached prosperity because of economic collectivization. In collective farms, tractors and harvesters have replaced the original wooden rakes and sickles.</p>
<p>Happy collective farmers sing joyful songs.</p>
<p>The Soviet state is a harmonious family composed of dozens of nationalities. The nationalities oppressed during the Tsarist era are now free to build their own national cultures.</p>
<p>In the Palace of Stories, such as the International Building, great care and attention is paid to children of all nationalities.</p>
<p>Donggu women use deerskin to make clothing, which is very exquisite.</p>
<p>For their success in economic and cultural construction, playwrights, novelists, farmers, military leaders and other workers of the Buryat-Mongol Republic were awarded medals by the Soviet government.</p>
<p>A six-year-old girl, Galyo, presented flowers to Comrade Stalin on behalf of the Buryat-Mongol delegation.</p>
<p>The revitalized Cossackistan sings folk songs in remote mountain villages. The national theater performs dramas, telling the love story of "Ji Shiqi Bieke." Soviet Cossacks warmly celebrate national holidays.</p>
<p>Collective farm riders perform brave and agile stunts.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is a country that enjoys happy rest and civilized entertainment. Tens of millions of people fill the gardens every day. In the Moscow Cultural Rest Park, tens of thousands of athletes and children are constantly engaged in physical training in winter and summer.</p>
<p>The parade of Moscow athletes is enough to show the youthful spirit of the Soviet Union. Various sports, including dancing, swimming, and skiing, are also performed on Red Square.</p>
<p>Air heroes compete for new world records on airplanes.</p>
<p>Unmanned flights across the snow-covered plains reach the Pacific coast without landing.</p>
<p>The spectacle of large groups of paratroopers.</p>
<p>The peaceful labor of Soviet workers and peasants is protected by a powerful Red Army with modern military technology.</p>
<p>A solemn review of motorized infantry, cavalry, artillery, and tank formations.</p>
<p>Military attaches from friendly countries congratulate Marshal Voroshilov.</p>
<h3>Kai Lan Si's New Work "Heartbroken Clouds and Rain"</h3>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Huares Pileri's "Spirited Away" (following "Long Live Freedom") is now being screened in Paris.</p>
<p>The director of "The Forty's" Sai Jinhua is a committee system, with You Jing, Shi Dongshan, Hong Shen, Sun Shuaiyi, Ling He, Ying Yunwei, Situ Huimin, Ouyang Yuqian and other eight people.</p>
<p>"Wolf Mountain Die Xue Ji" is scheduled to be released on the 14th at the Carlton New Light. The theme song of the film, "Wolf Mountain Ballad", has now been requested by the White Generation Company to be recorded, and will be sung by Li Lili and Zhang Yi.</p>
<p>Tian Han's screenplay and Shi Dongshan's direction of "Huangshan Bell" has very serious and correct ideology. The subject matter and background are taken from the magnificent Huangshan. It has now been arranged properly. The leading actors are also assigned to be red artists such as Hu Ping, Jin Shan, Tong Yuejuan, and Shi Chao. It will probably start shooting in the near future.</p>
<p>"Crossroads" has three songs, one of which was written by Guan Lu and sung by Zhao Dan, which is very lively and beautiful.</p>
<p>The central roles of Yuan Muzhi's new work "Street Angel" have now been decided, including Zhao Huishen, Wei Heling, and Zhao Dan. What is missing is a prostitute role, one that is very innocent and pure, which has not yet been found.</p>
<p>"Little Orphan Girl" is now 90% complete, and the premiere is imminent. The film is the first work starring the young star Chen Juanjuan as the sole lead, and it is worth noting. Juanjuan's performance in the film is petite and exquisite, innocent and lovely, especially a few dance scenes, which are extremely moving.</p>
<p>After "Bai Qi Tu" was released in the two theaters, it attracted the attention of the Shanghai Boy Scouts. Yesterday, Minli Middle School and others contacted the two theaters to discuss group preferential treatment methods.</p>
