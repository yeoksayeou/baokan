<h3 id="c30">全國法界的寃獄賠償運動 <a href="#c30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>全國法界爲保障入權而發起的寃獄賠償運動雖祇有短短六年的歷史但共效果不獨已引起各界的注意且已經全國司法會議决議由司法院咨立法院從速制定寃獄賠償法規以保障人權今日上海律師公會又舉行寃獄賠償運動聯合各界擴大宣傳促政府早日制定法規這是一件很値得贊助的事情</p>
<p>寃獄的構成有由於法律本身的缺陷的有由於法律運用的失當的前者屬於立法的範疇後者屬於司法的範疇現在全國法界所主張的寃獄賠償是指後者而言的司法上構成寃獄的根本原因是審判的違反正義司法上的審判要根據正義的要求以權力的行動而促公平合理的判决的實現我國司法制度還未完善司法官吏之能廉明守法審理案件以正義做標準的固不乏人但其學養不足問案决獄不以正義做標準的也在所難免因此便造成了許多司法上的寃獄</p>
<p>寃獄的應予賠償是基於國家的民事責任而來的在昔專制時代一般人以爲國家是皇室的私產帝皇對於人民有生殺予奪的特權無所謂民事責任故從前宋高宗給無罪的人以還家所需的錢米不過是帝皇的恩惠不能視爲國家的寃獄賠償今入對於國家的觀念和昔人不同國家是人民政治生活的集體是替人民管理一切事務的機關它在行爲上不過是私人的積體其行爲的責任應和普通法人相等故近代國家除外交行爲勘亂行爲以及其他行爲之爲國防上所必要的得不負民事責任外其他一切行爲都須負民事責任的司法機關是國家經管人民事務機關的一種司法事務是國家經管入民事務的一種它的性質和行政行爲沒有多大分別故其不法加害於入民的行爲也應由國家負賠償的責任</p>
<p>寃獄賠償旣是必要故法治先進國家不論在公法方面或私法方面對於入民因其機關的權力行動而發生的損害都予以賠償的例如挪威法國和意國等都在刑事訴訟法中規定寃獄賠償制度德國奧國和日本等則制定單行法令以規定國家在刑事上的賠償制度英國和美國雖無成文法典可以依據但在判例中規定國家在刑事上應負賠償責任的也是很多的至於我國現行法令中還沒有寃獄賠償制度的規定全國律師協會有鑒及此乃於民國二十年開始爲寃獄賠償的運動到去年九月司法院召集的全國司法會議也接受這運動而决議請司法院咨立法院從速制定寃獄賠償法是我國的寃獄賠償制度已有端倪倘全國法界能繼續努力自不難促立法當局迅卽採納於我國的法典中的</p>
<p>不過我人以爲寃獄賠償的作用充其量也祇能救濟寃獄於發生之後難以防止寃獄的發生其救濟是消極的至於積極的救濟則在防止寃獄的發生而防止寃獄發生的方法則首在求司法制度的完善和嚴定法律用語的意義故我人深望法界同人於從事寃獄賠償運動的時候更努力改良司法制度以作積極的救濟</p>

<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<p>重農歟？重工（下）　曾迪光</p>
<p>對於我國經濟改造問題，有主張以農為重者，有主張以工為重者，亦有主張農工並重者，茲將各派之主張歸納如左：</p>
<p>主張以農為重者所持之理由　年來吾國農業恐慌之深刻，與夫農民貧困之劇烈，使有識之士，認定欲求中國經濟之改造，必先由農業方面着手。彼等除實際參加鄉村建設以外，復提出左述各種論據，以求喚起國人之注意：</p>
<p>（甲）吾國數千年以來，旣以農為立國之本，故發展農業，卽為鞏固國本；</p>
<p>（乙）吾國業農入口，旣佔人口之最大多數，故發展農業，卽為最大多數之國民謀幸福；</p>
<p>（丙）中國經濟恐慌之深刻化，乃農村經濟凋敝有以致之，故發展農業，卽為减輕中國經濟恐慌之方策；</p>
<p>（丁）中國經濟之發展，在其歷史的及國際的環境之下，唯有以農為本；</p>
<p>（戊）農村經濟為工商業所依附，故發展，農村，卽為鞏固工商業之基礎；</p>
<p>（己）農村經濟若能鞏固，農村秩序卽能安定，農民之動亂亦能减少；</p>
<p>（庚）農村若能複興，都市之過剩人口卽能减少：</p>
<p>（辛）農村經濟若能繁榮，財政問題必能迎刃而解。</p>
<p>主張以工為重者所持之理由主張中國經濟之改造，務宜以工業為重者，以為「筋肉生產方法，對於入民福利上之貢獻，决不如機械生產方法之宏大」，故彼等主張中國經濟之改造，唯有採取工業化之路綫。其主要論據，有左述六端：</p>
<p>（甲）世界各國之經濟基礎，旣以工業經濟為中心；中國經濟為世界經濟之一環，故其經濟發展行程，亦須循此軌道，方不致落後而反常。</p>
<p>（乙）歐美各國，凡以工業為國民經濟之重心者，皆能富强：吾國因工業不發達，遂處於貧弱之地位。</p>
<p>（丙）中國目前最嚴重之危機，卽因列强之工業品源源侵入，故為拯救此一危機計，宜迅速振興民族工業，藉以抵制。</p>
<p>（丁）工業若能發展，吾人卽可利用一切原料，故其結果，當能使農民收入增加，農村金融充實，農民生計安定，由是而穩定整個國民經濟之基礎。</p>
<p>（戊）欲求吾國工業化，乃非不可能之事。苟吾人能努力設法改良生產方法，工廠管理，以及虛心採納他人之所長，其前途必能光明。</p>
<p>（己）政府及金融家若能切實與實業家合作，欲求中國經濟建設之工業化，必無問題。</p>
<p>平心而論，上述兩派所列之理由，雖各有共片面之眞理在，然彼此均有未當之處。主張中國經濟建設應以農業為中心者，因拘於農為國本之因襲思想，以致否認中國經濟有工業化之絕對必要性，此卽其最嚴重之錯誤也。第二，現代經濟旣以工業為中心，吾人若不順應時勢，只求單獨的振興農業，實乃反常的復古運動，决非經濟發展之原則所能容許；第三，農業建設若求能順利進行，必領工業經濟提供優良之技術，精巧之機械，充裕之資本，以及大量之人才，方克如願：第四，單獨的農業建設，縱能實現，但亦不能拯救中國目前之經濟危機，徙為列强壟斷商品市塲而已。至主張中國經濟改造應以工業為中心者其所持之意見，亦不免於偏袒，且未注意及下述諸問題：　中國農村經濟基礎未行澈底改變前，吾人欲求中國經濟建設澈底工業化，誠有不可能之勢；　在列强政治及經濟暴力壓迫之下，吾人若求振興民族工業，必甚困難，年來新興民族工業之崩潰，卽可為前車之鑒；　欲使中國之經濟建設以工業為重，必須先有充裕之資金，方克如願。中國已貧困如此，資金將由何處而來。交通之不便，苛捐雜稅之壓迫，與夫封建式之剝削，凡此等等，若未迅速革除，中國經濟發展欲求以工業為重心，卽非易事：　中國經濟建設若以工業為重心，農村資本至少暫時的必形窮乏，農民之動亂，亦愈形危險。</p>
<p>由是可知，中國經濟之發展，若單獨偏重，决非至善方策，且目前國際環境至為惠劣，吾人必過無窮之阻力，惟有以最大之毅力與最後之决心，雙方進行，在農村方面，吾人固宜從事鄉村改造工作，積極訓練氏衆，充實力量，使廣大之農民羣衆互相團結，發展中國經濟，同時在都市方面，宜從事建設小規模之工業，使生活絕對必需品，能漸次自給自足。故中國國民經濟之基磯：宜由農業而建樹；經濟範圍，則宜由工商而擴大，相輔而進，不宜有所偏重也。</p>

<p>各縣因山嶺重疊、林木深邃、交通極不便利、路上行人稀少、行時須帶乾糧食鹽、故有老死不相往來者、其路之難行、諺　「蝨倒退、鬼見愁、閻王見了三擺頭、」蠶叢鳥道殆不足以方此、山間農民多獨處、室廬極簡陋、有穴洞以居者、夜不點燈、與野獸為伍、房縣有一保長至數十里、一聯保長至四百里、推行政令、極感困難、如召集壯丁訓練、數日之間、僅能集中十餘人、其有居民數十家之村莊、則必為一姓一族、族長必為惡覇、如古之土司、擁槍者又儼然酋長、故政府所委之區長、皆此輩「坐山虎」充之、政府且須仰其鼻息、此等區長、旣皆為坐山虎、恐落平陽、不肯入城、有「聽調不聽宣」之槪、縣府命令坐而受之、卽為客氣、遵行與否、非彼所注意、亦非官廳所敢聞問也、共與縣府接洽之事、大致皆由駐城辦事處代表辦理、如竹山區長朱鳳章卽其中之一人、現因犯有重法、槍兵已被解散、將告肅淸、其他仍除不勝除、</p>
<p>農村經濟、絕對破產、蓋所產食品、不能足食、而生漆·桐油·木耳·藥材等副產、因交通不便、無法運出、其少數農民、不避艱苦、將物品肩負出山、究難多運、民問通用現幣、至今猶然、雖有法幣輸入、不能辨識眞贗、鮮有用老、五元法幣、雖在城市亦無法折兌、故運貨出山之農民、必取得現徉回山、值此推行法幣之際、外縣商入、故意剝削、一百元之貨物以換現折水、又損失十之二三、現皆改為交易貨物、洋貨得以源源輸入、日貨更因價低之故、特別暢銷、窮鄉僻壤之間、外人經濟勢力、侵入無阻、殊堪危懼、</p>
<p>農民生活、本極困窘從前卽「日無半升米、夜無半床被、」近年以來、水旱迭乘、加以赤匪·土匪·潰兵·豫匪·陝匪川匪之不時竄擾、及士司酋長之長期需索、皮肉盡枯、生機已斷、農民大多數不知米為何物、鹽為何味、昨在榖城、親見房竹駐軍及法團來電、謂樹皮草根、皆已食盡、諒非虛語、又以產棉甚少之故有終身未着棉衣者、此種生活、疑非人間、山中氣候不常、八月卽飛雪、至次年三月始溶解、同一時間、一山有四種氣候、最上一層為大晴天、次層有雲霧、三層降雪、四層下雨、因氣候關係、人民四季烤火、多染疾病、最奇之病為「氣頸」、係樹上之葉、含有某種毒質、墮入水中、飲之卽患此病、初僅項下起疤、慚長慚大、甚者如五石之瓢、直垂胸際、穿頭卽死、十人中患者八人、慣見遂不以為奇、反之如有他縣人入境、見無「氣頸」反覺稀異、此病吸食鴉片者不患、多食海帶、搽碘酒亦不患、息者亦可醫、前者為事實如此、後者係外縣人發明、但土人甚窮、海帶碘酒、價又不賤、雖知共法、亦無力醫治矣、又有爛眼之疾、十人中患者約五六人、大約因不潔而傳染、</p>
<p>時代之輪、停滯於中古、教育低落、亦為主因、共低落程度、聞之使人發噱、縣城雖保設有小學、而設備簡單、師資缺乏、又無新式教材、竹山某校長、自稱為「洋教習」、學生大致年在二十四五以上、有超過三旬者、其讀書目的、非有宏道明理、濟世安民之壯志、亦非有升官發財封妻蔭子之野心、特為學作狀詞、以備與人與訟耳、以故官廳制詞、士棍狀稿、彼等皆廣集成册、背誦如流其地非所知、亦非所急也、至於鄉村小學、可謂全無、卽私塾亦少、文盲之多、佔百分之九十六强、公文佈告、皆不認識、</p>
<p>綜上所述、在精神物質兩方而、房竹農民所處之境、直與世界人類不同、救濟辦法、首在開闢道路、發展交通、使文化得以輸入貨物得以輪出、自此至房縣、已有八十二師兵工所修路基、中僅兩山尙未炸裂、如政府與人民繼續興築、假以時日、當可觀成、惟兩竹之間、難以設計耳、（五月十八日發於石花街）</p>

<p>— 正中書局編譯所自然科學組主任薛德堉</p>
<p>環繞我們的自然界，有兩種東西；一種是無生命的，一種是有生命的。研究關於無生命的各種現象的學問，叫做物理的科學；研究關於有生命的各種現象的學問，呌做生物學。生物學並非始於今日，在二千餘年前希臘文明最燦爛的時期，已經有一位學者叫做亞里士多德（Aristotle）他曾經着手研究生物方面的各種現象，但自亞里士多德以後，一直到十五世紀，並無顯著的進步和發展，因為當時基督教的勢力太盛，宗教繼續不斷的壓迫科學，致事實與迷信混淆不分，所謂現代生物學，到十九世紀初葉，纔具雛形，距今不過二百餘年而已。這二百餘年的進步，其勢如旭日之東昇，舉其犖犖大者說：第一是細胞說的確立；第二是生物進化的證明。茲就這兩點分別說明如下：</p>
<p>距今二百餘年前，英國的植物學家胡克氏（Robert　Hoore）切木拴的薄層，放在極簡單的顯微鏡下觀察，發見木拴由許多蜂窩狀的集團所成，氏稱之為細胞。復經許多學者研究，又知道蜂窩狀的細胞裏面並不空虛，還充滿着構造極複雜的物質。至十九世紀德國的動物學家什凡（Schwann），更發見動物的身體也是成於很小的細胞，同時德國的植物學家什來頓（Schleiden）又發見植物的細胞和動物的細胞大體相同，藉這兩位學者的研究，方纔知道從前認為風馬牛不相及的動物和植物，根本上確定由同一祖宗傳下來的。動物界和植物界這樣地攙手以後，對於人智上確有莫大之進步，並且還給我們「在顯微鏡下面別有一個天地」的暗示。</p>
<p>細胞之於生物彷佛像重量的單位是克，長度的單位是厘米一樣，可以說是生物體的單位。而且細胞不僅是生物體中發生生活現象的本源體就是子女酷似其父母的遺傳現象，還是細胞的一種作用，所以生理學，遺傳學以及生物學的其他分科，研究的焦點都集中在細胞了。換句話說，生物學的基礎，應建築在細胞上，細胞的原理如不明瞭，生活體的作用就無從理解。再進一層說，關於生命的問題，如不澈底研究細胞，也就永遠不得解决。</p>
<p>生物體旣由細胞所成，然而產生生命的細胞究竟如何出世的呢？這種思想　　縈迥於我們的腦際。原來人類是很聰明的，凡是人智所不能解釋的問題，輒委之於天，委之於神，以卸却他自己的責任，關於生物的生命在過去數千年間，亦會一度委之於神。自細胞學進步以後，始知其生命的細胞不能由無而有，有細胞才能產生細胞，換句話說，沒有旣存的生命，决不能發見繼續有生命的物體。</p>
<p>在細胞發見之前，有幾位學者，知道自然界中有肉眼所不能見的微生物——原生動物或細菌。距今二百五十餘年前，荷蘭的雷汶胡克（Leeuwenhoock）用玩具狀顯微鏡研究各種物體，有一天，取雨水一滴放在顯微鏡下觀察，發見雨水中間潛有無數的極活動的微細動物和植物，便向學界報告，其時響應的人很少，幸而雷氏富有資產，仍孜孜不倦的研究，卒發見某種細菌和原蟲以及血球在人體內運動的方法，於是世人始知有微生物的存在。當時學者對於魚是卵生獸是胎生的一點，早已深信不疑，這無異已承認有了生物纔能產生生物，但是發見微生物之後，目擊微生物在短時間內可繁殖許多數目，這類小生物恐怕是突然發生——由神創造——的思想，又復活起來，雖有一二傑出的學者，堅决反對，但至細胞說確定以前，還未抓住確實的證據。嗣後顯微鏡的構造進步，微生物愈加發達，方纔明瞭由單細胞所成的微生物，沒有種子亦不能發現，由神創造之說，遂不攻自破。</p>
<p>要討論生命是怎樣來的？生物是怎樣的？這似乎是有閒階級的思想，和人生沒有多大關係，但是生物學在人文史上是大有貢獻的業蹟之一，所以特別把細胞說和微生物的關係提出來討論一下：</p>
<p>雷汶胡克發見微生物，繼文明瞭微生物也是由細胞所生，這難道和人生沒有關係麼？距今三四十年前，法國的釀造界曾起一度的大恐慌，幾使法國的釀造界有瀕於破產的危險，就是法國人向恃為生命的葡萄酒以及其他酒類，都腐敗而無法收拾。當時法國有名的化學家巴斯　（Pastenr），調查其腐敗的原因，發現從前所不知道的牌酒，葡萄酒以及其他酒類的發酵，都是叫做發酵菌的一種微生物作用，因這種細菌的發酵作用，製酒的原料才能變成酒。同時又發現釀造的時候，往往有異常發酵的現象，即在發酵如混雜使酒腐敗的微生物，那末已成的酒便腐敗而不適於飲用。不僅酒是如此，就是人體或其他有機體腐敗的時候，仍不外乎是細菌的作用。巴氏發見這種現象以後，繼續不斷的研究，又想到家畜和人類的一切疾病，或許也是這種微生物的作用，經過無數次的實騐，果然明瞭疾病與微生物的關係。其時法國的養蠶界，又發生一個絕大的問題，即蠶兒發現一種最恐怖的疾病——微粒子病，幾使法國的養蠶事業一蹶而不復振，巴氏埋頭研究，卒發見蠶兒的疾病，也是起於一種細菌，於是設法預防，終能挽旣　之狂瀾。嗣後巴氏又確定破傷風和狂犬病的病原，聞用血淸注射以治療此類疾病之途。現在我們對於各種傳染病，已能事前預防，事後挽救，可說是直接聞接種巴氏研究的餘　。</p>

<h3 id="c171">决心 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 婉文</p>
<p>小朋友們！我在未講决心以前，先得把决心來分析一下，决是决定，心是人體中的一顆心，决定兩字的意思說，用心去决定。其實心何能决定，這都是腦的工作，不過是一般人的說法。我也跟了這說法，來談談决心。</p>
<p>决心這兩字，聽着怪熟的。看了很普通。我爲何去寫呢？因决心是促進事業成功的主要條件，我舉幾個例來證明，發明家下了决心才發明各種有益於世的事物，總理下了决心才有了現在的中華民國，他們的成功。當然有種種原因造成的，但决心也是其中之一，倘要做一件事，腦中存了個遲疑不决的思想，聽了這人說去做，那人說不可去做，那麼這事永不能成功的。總而言之，人生在世，每做一事，非有决心不可。</p>
<p>不過决心。用得不適當，不但不能得其益，反而受其害，所以在要做一件事時，用你的思想去審判是吾要不决心，我前面說：「每做一事，非有决心不可，」現又說：「要審判决心的應用。」各位不是覺得矛盾嗎？我現把它解釋一下，凡一件事有好壞的分別，好和壊是沒有一定標準的，用你的審判力，覺得這事有益的，便决心去做，無益的，丟開了它，這樣决心是你的好朋友，能幫助你事業成功，而得着好的結果。</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>十歲的音樂家</p>
<p>波蘭南部，維斯都拉河流域，奧斯德都德村中，有一位農夫的兒子，呌做布格萊山的，今年還只有十歲半，已能彈得一手的好披亞那。他的父親，是很貧窮的，所以他從七歲起，在一個義務學校中讀書，但每天只能讀二三小時，餘多的光陰，都是在他的父親的一個小小的牧塲中度着的。他聽着波羅的海中的含有寒意的微風，襲擊着牧塲四週，高矮不一的樹木，所發出高低不一的聲息，覺得有一種難以形容的悅耳的調子，在晚春的天氣中，聽着各種遠近不一的禽鳥的鳴聲，他又覺得是富有音樂意味。從八歲那年起，求着他的父親，給他買了一個小小的提琴，在牧塲中，跟着天籟奏着。雖然他的奏琴，是沒有譜調的，但是其音調的柔和，却往往引得四鄰，都圍聚着，聽他演奏。因此，他更高興了，忘了他父親所付與他的工作的責任。經他父親的一再警吿之後，他對於演奏的興趣，並不稍减，於是他的提琴，便終於給他的父親毀了。但這消息，不久是給一位敎堂中的牧師知道了，於是商得他父親的同意，敎他演奏披亞那。他不拘甚麽調子，一學便會，而且手法的佳妙，處處顯示着他是富有音樂天才的，直樂得那老牧師，心花都開放了，悉心的敎導着他。去年耶誕節上，把他帶到魯白林市去，公開演奏，並爲貧苦兒童，籌募救濟費。結果，所得不貲。近聞該牧師，已爲他籌有的欵，將把他送往法國，以資深造。</p>
<p>十三歲的畫家</p>
<p>法國邊尼羅河，范倫斯城的郊外，住着一個很貧苦的家庭，主人是一個近五十歲的寡婦，呌做美根李而夫人。一家五口，靠着幾條乳牛過着活。伊的丈夫，是一個不著名的畫家，身後遺着四個未成年的子女，境况很是蕭條。但是伊的第三女兒瑪利亞，却是從小便很愛作畫，常把伊父親的遺作，臨摹着，極感興味。從十歲起，伊更努力地作畫。在十一歲上，便在范倫斯城，開了一决個人的畫展。把一幅「范倫斯城的黃昏，」售得了三百法郞。一幅「乞丐與狗」，售得了在百五十法郞。一九三五年的春天，在里昂市外開着個展，一輻「十字架上的耶穌」，標價六百法郞，終於在七百五十法郞的代價之下售出。伊的畫藝，完全是自己研究出來的，沒曾受過名師的指授。現在，伊有一個很遠的親戚，自願資助伊往巴黎研究。這位天才的女畫家，將來的造就必然的是無可限量的。</p>

<p>有一天，華盛頓質問他的書記爲什麽要遲到，他的書記回答說，因爲他家裏的時鐘慢了，華盛頓就正色說：「那麼你可去買隻正確的時鐘！你如不這樣做，我卽刻要雇用別人。」自此以後，他的書記就不敢再遲到。</p>
<p>拿破侖在一天晚上請客，到了入座的時光，諸將都還沒有來，他一個人就坐下來吃，當他吃好剛要離開桌子的時候，看見諸將纔進來，他點着頭對諸將說：「現在吃的時間已過了，請你們各人仍去做各人的職務。」遲到的諸將都紅着顏退出。</p>
<p>小朋友！你們平日到學校去有遲到過嗎？「遲到」是很不好的習慣，會養成你們的疏懶性的，小朋友，你們如有過的話，請你們從今天起就改過。</p>

<p>這幾天，德兒總看見智兒呆望着天空，不知在做些什麽，所以德兒就懐疑的問他這：</p>
<p>「哥哥！你老望着天空在看些什麽呀？」</p>
<p>「好，就對你說了吧！我新近覺得看雲實在是一個最好的消遣方法。」智兒含了笑回答他弟弟。</p>
<p>「看雲爲什麽是最好的消遣方法呢？」</p>
<p>「譬如，你早上看見雲的顏色是紅黃紫靑的，但是日中再看就不對了，每朶雲白得同雪一樣，像一隻隻的帆船很快的行着。仔細看看有牛啦，馬啦，人啦，若再看看，一切都沒有了。尤其是下雨的日子，滿天的烏雲，像有無數的蛟龍在裏頭游來游去，煞是好看。弟弟！你莫小覷了它，它確是比電影戲劇勝得多哩！你不信，不妨試試看吧！」果然不出數日，德兒也染着了他哥哥的癖了。</p>

<p>— 陸洛</p>
<p>——一個有趣的世界各她時差檢査表——</p>
<p>明亮的太陽光，照射到我們的地球上來。</p>
<p>地球是從西向東的自轉着，自轉一次，就是天；我們聰明的人類，便把這自轉一次的時間，分成二十四小時。——所以地球自轉一次，就是二十四小時，也就是一天。</p>
<p>當地球受到太陽光的地方，就是明亮的地方，我們稱做白天。地球上受到太陽光的，只有一部份；別一部份便沒有太陽光射着；太陽光照射不到的地方，便稱做黑夜。</p>
<p>所以在地球上，同一的時候，有的地方是太陽正當頂，這是正午；有的地方是太陽已偏西，這是午後；有的地方太陽剛下去，這是黃昏；有的地方太陽剛起山，這是早晨；有的地方沒有太陽完全墨黑，這是夜晚。</p>
<p>當我們吃中飯的時候，世界各地的人們，有的正在起身洗臉；有的正在掯着書包進學校；有的吃了午飯已在上課；有的巴放晚學，有的已在吃晚飯；有的正在上床睡覺；有的正在床上做甜夢。</p>
<p>爲什麼會有這樣的差異呢？原來因爲地球是個圓豳，地球而上各地的時間，都以太陽做標準的——太陽正在頭頂時是正午。我們地球上共分成三百六十度，把三百六十度分成二十四，剛巧是十五度成一個單位。因此，太陽照在地球上，每隔十五度，便有一小時的相差。用這個方法來推算世界各地的時間，便是：</p>
<p>如果我們上海是早上九點鐘，那麼：新加坡是八點鐘；印度的加爾各答是七點鐘；莫斯科是早上三點半鐘；倫敦是午夜一點鐘；紐約是夜晚八點鐘；舊金山是黃昏五點鐘；夏威夷是下午二點半；日本東京是早上十半點鐘。</p>
<p>我們用什麼方法來知道世界各地的時間差別呢？</p>
<p>現在我有一個最簡便的方法敎小朋友們，只要小朋友們背動手做，很容易的便能做成功，而且也不要化錢去買什麽工具材料的，只要請小朋友預備：</p>
<p>剪刀一把，馬糞紙（的一方尺大小）一張，銅書釘一隻，和一些漿糊。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友不是已經看見了前面附着的一張圓形地圖嗎？這張圖，便是世界地圖的縮影（它把南半球的部份放寬了），因爲是以北極做中心，從北極看到地球的各方去，所以地面上的陸地和海洋的形狀成了扁而闊的樣子了。</p>
<p>小朋友們把道個地圖剪下來，要依了圓形綫剪；剪下後，便把它貼在馬糞紙上，把馬糞紙也剪得圓圓的。接着就是把右下角的一個寫畫着畫夜和時間的小圓形圖剪下來，也貼在馬糞紙上，也把它剪成圓形。——漿糊不要用得太多太厚，也不要太少，要塗得很勻。</p>
<p>這一大一小兩個圓圖剪好之後，便在圓形中心開一個孔，把小圓圖放在地圖的北極上——就是中心——，然後用一只黃銅色的書釘穿到孔中，把書釘的脚折在地圖背後。這樣，世界各地時差檢查　便成了。</p>
<p>假定你要查在上海中午十二點鐘，世界各地大都會是什麼時間時，你只要把圖中的小圓盤上畫字下的十二對準上海的一條經綫上，這樣你就可以看到各地的時間了：東京是下午一點半；布里斯本是二點鐘又十分；斐吉羣島是四點不到；夏威夷是五點半鐘；舊金山是晚上八點鐘；紐約是晚上十一點十分；里約　內盧是半夜一點多鐘；倫教是早晨四點鐘；羅馬是早晨五點鐘；莫斯科是早晨六點半鐘；……這樣的檢査到上海。</p>
<p>假定你要以倫敦的正午十二點做標準，檢查世界各地的時間，也只要照上法去做，就能知道了。</p>
<p>好，我的話完了，請小朋友動手來做吧！做的决序是：</p>
<p>第一，找工具和材料；第二，照方法做；第三，照方法玩。第四，玩過以後要想方法把它改良，或是發明比這方法更便當；或是別的新的有價値的玩意兒。</p>

<h3 id="c177">磚石投入水中水面怎會現水泡 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>我們隨意拿一塊磚石，投入水中，頃刻間水面上就現出水泡來，這是什麽道理？小朋友恐怕知道的並不多，讓我來簡單的說個明白吧：</p>
<p>因為物體投入水中，若比同體積的水輕，就上浮；若比同體積的水重，就下沉。同時物體在水中所失的重量，等於被擠出之水的重量。那末，我們用磚石投入水中，自然因爲比同體積的水重就下沉，當它下沉的時侯，接觸部的水被擠壓，散於周圍，中間暫時留着空隙，但空氣內的密度和比重，都小於水，所以空隙中雖滿貯空氣，然它近旁上部的密度較大於水，自然因表面張力的作用。很快的便爭來補缺，以保持它的水平面，空隙裏的空氣被迫得無路可走，就被水膜一部一部的包圍起來，變成了許多大小不等的氣囊，升了上來，浮在水面，卽成為我們通常所見的水泡，待水泡破裂，空氣才散。諸位要是不信，自可馬上試騐。</p>

<p>小朋友！現在讓我來告訴你們三種白紙上顯影的方法：</p>
<p>將幾塊明礬溶解在水中，用一支乾凈的毛筆醮了這明礬水寫字或圖畫在中國紙上，等它乾後，紙上可以沒有一點痕跡，但是如拿這紙在淸水中一拖，上面的字跡立刻會變成透明而顯出來。</p>
<p>將筆醮米湯寫在紙上，再放進有碘酒（普通藥房有出售）的水，中，紙上便會顯出藍色的你的字跡。</p>
<p>用乳汁在紙上寫字，等它乾後便是一張曰紙，但如放在火上一烘，黃色的字跡便會很淸楚地顯出來。</p>

<p>柯甘士夫人不敢放聲說甚麼話，但伊等到老達士的棺木葬下，小南洛和柏德希去了之後，拿一個小小的花圈交給伊的女兒小　洛，喚伊尊敬地送到那墳上去，只見一個黑黑的土饅頭，立在雪中罷了。</p>
<p>小南洛和柏德希非常傷心的回到家裏去。但那凄凉寂寞的小屋子，再也不能給與他們一些最小的慰安。老達士在死時，還有一個月的租金沒有付，可是小南洛自葬了他的老祖父之後，這一個銅幣也不剩。他去哀求那小屋子的主人，此人是一個補鞋匠，他每逢星期日的晚上，總得和磨坊主人柯甘士在一起抽烟喝酒的。他對於小南洛的哀求不做理會。他的爲人殘酷而吝嗇，向來是愛錢如命的，他把小屋子裏的一鍋一壺，一棒一石，全都拿了去抵償他所應收的租金，當下吩咐小南洛，明天定須遷出去。</p>
<p>那屋子又小又低，簡直是不成模樣的，但他們住得太久了，心中很有些兒捨不得，他們住在這裏一向是很快樂的。每年夏季，屋上攀滿了藤，豆花兒開得香香的，襯托着陽光照耀的田野，越顯得景色的美麗，平日間雖是辛勤工作，挨受着窮苦的况味，然而他們的心中很滿足很愉快，每晚總是跑回來，看那老人家的歡迎的笑容。</p>
<p>這一夜，小南洛和柏德希終夜的坐在黑暗中，傍着那冷冰冰地不生火的壁爐，彼此貼緊在一起，借此取暖，他們的身上倒也不覺得怎樣寒冷，但他們的心却好像是冰凍的了。</p>
<p>天明了，晨光照滿了那雪白而冰凍的大地，這是耶穌聖誕前夕的早晨了。小南洛抖顫了一下，緊抱着他那唯一的好友柏德希，熱淚一滴滴地滴在柏德希的頭額上，他低聲說道：「走吧！柏德希——親愛的柏德希！我們决不願意等候着給屋主踢出門去，還是自己先走吧。」</p>
<p>柏德希本來是沒有主張的，只服從它的小主人的命令。他們倆憂鬱地走出了這座愛戀的小屋子。他們對於道屋子裹任何不値錢的東西，也都覺得很珍貴很可愛的。柏德希垂頭喪氣的走過他那綠色的小車：從此冉也不是他的了。這車兒和其餘的許多東西一起要抵償那拖欠着租金的，還有那銅質的駕駛物，亮晃晃地臥在雪堆裏。柏德希見了這兩件平日相依爲命的寳貝，簡直很願意在它們旁邊躺下來，立刻就死，但是它的小主人還活着，還需要它。它仍須打起精神奮鬥下去。</p>
<p>他們走着天天走慣的那條路上盎凡爾去。這時天還沒有大明，人家的窗子仍還關閉着。路上只有幾個村人罷了。小南洛和柏德希走過時，他們也並不注意。小南洛停住在一家的門前，懇切地向裏面望去：他的老祖父生前對於這一家向來是熱心帮忙的。</p>
<p>他怯生生地說道：「求你們可能給柏德希吃一些兒麵包屑嗎？它是老了，並且從昨天下午以來，還沒有吃過甚麼東西。」那屋子裏的婦人立刻關上了門，口中在喃喃地說甚麼這年頭兒麥價稻價很貴的。可憐小南洛和柏德希只得有氣沒力的向前面走去；再也不向人家去乞食了。</p>

<h3 id="c181">「潛在武力論」批判 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 靑軍</p>
<p>一九三一年，國際聯盟附屬的國際議會聯盟發行了一部論文集，書名叫「未來戰爭如何？」，在這論文集中有法國弗里德教授，德國門基爾將軍，日本靑野教授等的文章，他們開始廣泛地提出了「潛在武力」的問題。就是弗里德教授的意見可說是這理論的代表。他的出發點是：「戰爭是依存於兵力的，同樣，也是依存於經濟力和財力的」，所以他認爲經濟力和財力在决定戰爭的勝負中有極重大的作用。他首先表明了他自己的硏究只是限於「潛作武力」的經濟要素，因之他避開了「純潛在武力」和「精神的政治的潛在武力」的探討。</p>
<p>所謂「純潛在武力」者，弗里德教授以爲是「地理的位置，國家資源的動員時間和條件，兵員，武裝，物質部分之相異，軍隊的質景和教育與構成，及其他」等；至於「精神的政治的潛在力」，則是指「住民的同一性和統一性，制度的不調和，以及其他」而說的。但這兩者他都以爲不重要，都未特別加以硏究。這樣，他在實際上　是把「經濟的潛在力」放在社會關係之外，從直接的軍事要素切開來觀察的；他　　「軍事的，政治的潛在力」，認爲這是「軍事技術家和政治家的硏究對象」；他只注意到了「經濟的潛在武力」，並將牠分爲三個構成部分：一，「人的要素或人口學的要素」。這個潛在力是A「爲軍事生產的十六歲以上六十歲以下的男子要多，地理地集中生產的民族構成要調和；B住民抑制自己的消費力愈强，這潛在力即愈大。二，「技術要素」。這是由A農業生產力，B原料與動力資源，C工業與運輸構成的。三，「經濟的財政要素」：A國民的負担力，B國家的借款欵力，C對外的支付力。</p>
<p>對於這樣的弗里德教授的見解，　們以爲首先値得注意的，是他旣認爲「政治的潛在力」是政治家硏究的對象，這和他的問題毫無關係，但在他所提出的「人的要素」中，却說到了住民的民族的同一性之重要；這很門然地是　到了政治的要因，使他的這個硏究和他的中心論點發生了不可調和的矛盾。</p>
<p>其次，弗里德教授提出了「住民抑制自己消費的能力」問題。但這能力是由什麽規定的呢？他並沒有明確的回答。實際上，所調「國民抑制自己消費的能力」，這不僅是經濟問題，而且也是政治問題。在資本主義國家內，戰爭一旦發生，必要更加限制一般勤勞國民的消費，努力榨取他們的血汗以充戰費；像這樣的抑制消費，顯然不是由於多數國民的心願，而是用暴力强制施行的。結果是這種抑制消費的力量愈大，多數國民便會愈感痛苦，愈要燃燒起反抗這一抑制和一切壓迫的精緒，因而也就愈益使得國內的矛盾尖銳他，以削弱甚至根本消減牠原來的對外戰　能力。由這點看來，可見所謂「抑制消費的能力」問題實與國家的政治形態有密切關係，只由一般經濟情勢去解說問題，必不能得出正確的結論的。</p>
<p>還有，所謂「國民的負擔力」，這雖然與戰爭有極大的關係，但却不能以一般的測定來决定問題。拿一般資本主義國家來說，因爲權力是集中在少數財主的手中，他們在戰爭時期不僅會設法避免自己的許多租稅負担，而且會巧妙地變更稅制以自利，結果是把戰爭的經濟負担主要地放在一般窮苦國民的頭上，使一般國民更加窮化。這樣，可見得「國民負担力」的問題也不僅是單純的經濟問題，而是有關於根本的社會問題的。</p>
<p>除弗里德之外，還有德國的和平主義者魯斯賓爾特，也是値得注意的「潛在武力論」者。他也和弗里德一樣，從未來戰爭的性質出發，首先指出了這戰爭的特點：「戰　員與非戰　員的區別將會消失，戰綫將不是相戰的軍隊的火綫，而是全國家的有機體，全體國民經濟組織的三次動員的　爭」。這不消說也是把「潛在武力」主要地解釋成爲經濟的潛在力的。</p>
<p>不過，詳細說來，魯斯賓爾特以爲「潛在武力」是由如下的幾個要素成立的：　「精神的諸要因，即軍事能力，發明力，例如締結同盟的政治的先見力」。　「生物學的諸要因，即住民，農業(包含牲畜)，燃料資源，紡織工業的原料」。　「鑛物學的諸要因，即未開　　資源，如石炭，鐵鑛，石油，特殊金屬，化學　業原料，鑛物肥料」。　「工業的諸要因，即運輸交通手段，機械製作工業，做機械力或電力泉源的水源，水力及其他」。</p>
<p>這樣，魯斯賓爾特所解　的「潛在武力」的要素與弗里德的便有點不同，即是前者是把某種政治的要素放在所謂「潛在武力」中了；如他所舉出的「精神的諸要因」，便可說是某種政治的要素。但可惜的是他把問題狹隘化了，他只看到政治的先見和締結同盟的能力之重要，　並未想到更重要的社會制度，政治形態的問　；更滑稽的是他居然把什麼「發明力」也　　决定的因素來舉出，使問題的特別重要　分　　掩蓋了。因此，他的「潛在武力論」　　局依然是以經濟的潛在力爲决定因素的。</p>
<p>魯斯賓爾特尢其注　金屬和　　的　　，認爲這有最大的决定作用。依據這個見解，他</p>

<p>解說了過去許多有名的戰爭。他以爲在奧大利和普魯士的戰爭中，普魯士之所以戰勝者，只是因爲它的銑鐵產額很多的緣故；普法戰爭中德國獲勝的原因也是同樣；對於美國的南北戰爭，在他看來，則是北方有豐富的石炭和金屬，所以才戰勝了農業的南方；　後，他更基於　，再說了在一九一四至一八年世界大戰中的勝負問題，認爲德國之戰勝俄羅斯，是因爲它的工業力量較大的緣故；但因爲它的工業力量不及英美，所以終於戰敗了。於是－他便結論道：「在未來戰爭中，有最良好最豐富的原料資源和戰爭機械生產之最良好的方法和手段者，必會獲得勝利」。然而，可惜的是他在解說過去的一回重要戰爭中，忘掉了一九一八至二〇年的全世界資本主義國家圍攻蘇聯的戰爭；若依魯斯賓爾特的解說，那以全世界資本主義的天然富力和工業力量來攻擊初生的蘇聯，必然是會馬到功成，獲得全勝的，但結果却是出乎意料之外地列強的　涉軍敗退了。這件事情實是魯斯賓爾特的「潛在武力論」在理論的發展途中所遇到的不能解說的難題，所以他竟故意將其拋開了。</p>
<p>不錯，國家的經濟力量，人們所說的　「潛在武力」與戰爭頗有關係，但這必須與軍事的武裝力量，社會制度，政治形態，國民和兵士的生活及思想會合起來作整個的觀察才有意義，不能把牠當作唯一的決定要素來解說問題。如現在各資本主義國家，它們的工業雖然很發達，財力也較充足，但因國內人羣的矛盾日益尖銳，國民乃至軍隊的思想和行動不統一，所以在戰爭的過程中，却是很危險的。這樣，被它們壓迫的人羣和民族如能一致　　到底，那就必能獲得最後的勝利。　便依上述那樣的「潛在武力論」者的說法，未來戰爭的勝利者必然是工業很發達，原料很豐富，財力很充足的國家，那如像美國那樣的帝國主義者便必然會勝利，至於貧弱的殖民地和半殖民地的弱小民族以及一般貧苦人羣，則是永世不能翻身的。這真是富強的帝國主義的貫論！</p>
<p>事實上，像上述那樣的「潛在武力論」，實是列強在「裁軍」，「擴軍」的爭　中產生的。比如，過去法國爲　反對德國擴軍，白里安仁特別　起人們注意德國工業的發展，指出這「潛在武力」的威力。又如，當真正的和平主義者提出完全裁軍的主張時，列強便恐慌起來，馬上便以「潛在武力論」來對付，說各國的化學工業，汽車工業，機械工業等等「潛在武力」不能消除，所以完全裁軍不可能。——像這樣產生出來的所謂「潛在武力論」，發出如上述的那些見解，說來也不是奇怪的事吧。</p>

<h3 id="c182">女伶 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭孟霞女士談</p>
<p>我是廣東中山縣人，那裏原名呌香山，是爲了紀念孫中山先生　改稱中山的。在十五歲時候，因爲父親到上海經商，我　跟他老人家到了上海。曾在徐家匯啓明女學裏念過書。我從小就喜歡哼哼平劇，常常同父親去看戲。而且平時天性又極喜歡音樂，唱片便是我的良友。計算起來，醉心皮簧和研究平劇，已快有十五年左右了。</p>
<p>回想十九歲那年，曾在上海三馬路的舊大舞台客串過一次。那要算我對平劇的第一次公演。以後，也常常出出堂會。曾加入上海著名票房如「申商」，「正誼社」，「精武體育會京劇部」等。</p>
<p>民國二十三年，我自己組織一個上海萬蓮劇團，南下在香港皇后戲院，廣州新華戲院，模　戲院等處上演。組班的時候，得了我的第二位先生關鴻賓君的幫忙；在港粵又得朋友及各界的捧塲。不過，我本不打算以賺錢爲目的；所以雖然每張票有曾賣到三元三角多的，但實際上沒有能夠得到什麽厚利。在演平劇之外，又同陳高聰君表演跳舞，比較上更受人歡迎。</p>
<p>在未南下以前，那也是碰巧吧？在勝利無線電公司主辦的中華全國跳舞比賽大會上，我和陳高聰先生偕舞。他被選爲中華全國跳舞大王；我也竟被選爲跳舞皇后。在我的本意是還想再求深造，所以常常請歐美有名舞藝家指導。對於平劇也是如此。</p>
<p>敎我平劇的第一位先生，大名呌陳詳雲，他便是從前清朝慈禧太后身邊很有面子的老伶工筱喜禧。以後又拜過關鴻賓先生爲師。加入申商票房便是由關先生介紹的。</p>
<p>我並非從小學戲的童伶，算是票友下海，故對於童伶生活不大詳細。大概，如果天資魯鈍又是被迫學戲的人，再遇見性情壞的先生，或者不免要吃些斥駡鞭笞之苦。至於我呢？可算是再舒適不過的幸運兒了。來往的多半是票友，耳濡目染，便可學得不少玩意。以前的陳先生擅長文武青衣花衫。關先生則除青衣花衫外，生凈丑均擅長。</p>
<p>在這裏我不妨講一點學平劇拜先生的規矩。如照舊規矩，還得點香燭行跪拜禮，而且在每次登台時也要到後台祖師座前行跪拜禮。普通點只要備一關書，向先生行三鞠躬禮，但後台祖師座前還得磕頭，以示恭敬。送關書時，要找介紹人，見議人，同署簽押。關書的內容大意爲：立投師關書人×××（書明年歲生辰）今托×××介紹當日三面言明自願投拜×××先生爲徒，學習戲劇（言明幾年內所得包銀如何拆賬。期滿之後，由×××親自收回等等）等語。</p>
<p>我對於平劇真是特別感到興趣，我所認爲極有味道和下了苦功學的幾駒老戲是「鴻鸞禧」，「花田錯」，「虹霓關」「鳳陽花鼓」等。但很覺得不可解的，便是目前越是下苦功練的老戲，歡迎者反而越佔少數。因此，我有好幾次在平劇舞台上反不能不借重於我的歐化跳舞了。</p>
<p>我到過北平天津，曾在天津北洋戲院上演，賣座還好。在北京華樂戲院曾與葉盛蘭君配戲。北平的「實報」和「立言報」曾經竭力給我很多指敎勉勵和贊揚。但我覺得，在我的目前環境下，是難以副大家的熱望的。</p>
<p>不幸得很－關先生同我的琴師，以及還有幾處來往的朋友，都不免和我對薄公庭。雖然沒有生出多大問題，然而我却因此增加了不少滄桑之感。</p>
<p>我曾經在上海天蟾舞台搭班，這是由表演我用苦功學來的「鴻鸞禧」一劇，得了趙如泉君的贊許，便來同我接洽的。所以，我覺得努力還是人生的必要條件。</p>
<p>我自己也同一個男子一樣，很懂得他人的心理，我不敢說一個人有時不免受人利用，但利用儘管利用，他總有一天可以達到他正確的目標的。</p>

<h3 id="c183">評「婦女共鳴」五卷四期 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 玉瑎女士</p>
<p>—出版處南京成賢街六十三號，定價每冊大洋一角—</p>
<p>「婦女共鳴」，這也是一個比較老的婦女刋物，以前我亦曾讀過幾期，但其觀點是不大正確的，　是在文字方面，也有許多滯澀而欠活潑簡練的地方。最近我聽說編輯換了人，並且曾稍加整理和改善了一下，所以又買了它來讀了一下，我所讀的便是五卷四期。</p>
<p>單就我所讀到的文章來說，無論在觀點上或文字的技術上，的確比從前都改良了些，在某些部分說，也可以說是一種　爲進步的刋物了。在文章的配合上是比較調和的，因爲它並沒有陷於像從前的許多婦女刋物，只故步自封地談些部分的婦女問題而忘却政治的那種錯誤。卽在談婦女問題上，它也相當能夠把它政治化，爲婦女們指出解放的道路和參加實際政治鬥爭的路綫。比如其中的「空穴來風的中蘇密約」，「戰爭空氣與戰爭烟幕」，「把全中國抱攏來」等文，就是純粹政治問題的評論，而「非常時期的婦運路綫」「國民大會代表問題之檢討」等等論文，也是相當地把婦女問題政治化了的，指出婦女運動應該怎樣實際地參加政治活動和其活動的路綫。就是「職業婦女的厄運及其解脫」一文也有其社會的和政治的總的出路的指示。能够這樣不遠離政治去談婦女問題，是很對的。除了這些文字之外，還有史料，婦女生活和文藝的描寫等等，亦能表現其並不單調和乾燥。一般的說來，文字上也有些有趣，整練，活潑的作品，這裏也是值得附帶地提及的。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但它也有不少的缺點。首先我們要說的，便是其中有些論文在政治上是沒有充分的堅定的正確立塲，因此在指示婦女應當怎樣去作政治鬥爭和過政治生活時，便缺乏了一定的社會階層的觀點，而作了些不正確的路綫的指示。例如「婦女的事業—政治」那篇譯文，作者本人就是美國最高統治者羅斯福的夫人，將帝國主義者的說教，拿來敎育自己的被壓迫的婦女羣衆，這是甚麼用意呢？並且她那篇文章的內容完全沒有一點反抗現實，改造現實的思想（當然她也不會有這種思想），她所敎導於婦女們的，只是呌她們如何按步就班，小心翼翼地循着現成法規去抬高自己個人的地位，去學做女政客而已，這就是對於婦女解放運動所盡的指導嗎？這位女政客不是明明在告訴婦女們要服從現制度好好當一個公僕，當一個「忠實，果敢，謙讓」的公僕嗎？「婦女共鳴」如果要把自己變成一個時代前面的進步的刋物，便絕不應該登載這類的文章，用它來指導婦女的政治生活的。</p>
<p>其次是，在這期「婦女共鳴」上，很顯明地雜入了一些唯心觀點的論文。比如「哲人詩人眼中的女人」一篇文章，它把那些鄙視婦女的所謂哲人詩人之鄙視女子的原因，完全歸入於「內愧的心理觀感」，「妒忌的自利」等等，從其個人和婦女的生活關係上去找說明，而不從社會制度，經濟關係上去說明怎樣决定這些人之必然鄙視婦女的原因，這就是觀念論的說法。因爲如果說他們反對女人只由個人的心理觀感出發，比如說孔子耶穌都是因爲恨他們的母親不貞才反對女人，那麼在原始社會裏，何以一切男子又沒有這種心理呢？那時一般的子女都是不知其父爲誰的，何以那時的男子又不鄙視他的母親呢？這明明是社會的經濟關係和社會制度之變遷，形成了男性中心地社會意識，决定了這些個人思想之後，他們才在擁護這種社會制度之下必然反對婦女的，並不是爲他們個人的心理作用和感情所支配和產生的。</p>
<p>此外，在這期刋物上，有些文章的觀點是略略表現得有點帶婦女主義的色彩的。雖然這種色彩不很濃厚，但如果是一個很前進的婦女刋物，它是應該完全免掉這種缺點的。可是，在這期刋物上却不能完全如此，頗有單純點在婦女的立塲上反對一切男子的傾向。比如說在「哲人詩人眼中的女人」一文中，因爲他不從客觀的社會變遷去找蕁男子輕視女子的根源，所以就不分時代地說只有千萬分之一的例外，男子們沒有一個不反對女人。其實，社會進展到了現在，一切社會的先進分子，廣大的勤勞大衆，從他的整個階層的總的意識與傾向說，都是同情於婦女的。那固執男性中心的思想的男人倒是個人的少數，而不是整個階層，並且這樣的人就是女子中也不在少數，作者也許就在婦女中心思想下仇視一切男子，而忘掉了這一事實。再如就「爲嫁後姓名請敎陳衡哲女士」一文來說，我以爲這個小問題並沒有加以嚴重的討論的價值，像陳衡哲那樣的人和這種主張，只須給她以小小的寸鐵就够了，根本用不着大張旗鼓來討論這些瑣碎問題。因爲如果這樣嚴重地來爭論這一問題，縱然也能暴露一部份男性中心思想的事實，但充分地表現婦女一定要爭得宗法社會遺傳下地氏姓，這和男性中心社會的男子一定要保持男性的姓氏，是一樣沒有意思和道理。實在說來，男子一定要女子姓自己的姓固然是錯誤的，是一種宗法社會的思想遺毒，因爲名字不過是一種符號，隨便用一個阿貓阿狗的名稱可代表自己就得了，並用不着要甚麼一定的姓氏，而婦女也一定要來爭這點權利，也就和過去的男子陷於同樣的錯誤了。並且婦女一定要爭得自己的姓氏的保存，並不是就爭得了甚麼婦女的權利。在我的意思是認爲男子固不應該强迫女子姓自己的姓，好像把女子當作是自己的所有物樣，但女子也不一定要必須保存自己的姓氏，就算有了女權。如果這樣，那就無異於把那宗法社會的姓氏看得很寶貴，或者是表示自己一定要堅守女子的陣地去和男子對抗，這種思想是落後的和帶有婦女主義色彩的。人的名字是可以隨便取的，因此可以隨自己的願意。假使一個女子爲了表示她很愛她的男子，取用男子的姓或名中之任何一字作爲自己的名字，只要不是被强迫而這樣做，就沒有甚麼遭侮辱和輕蔑的意味，是可以的。反之，男子因爲很愛他的女子，而取女子的姓名中之任何一字作爲自己的名字，也一樣並不受侮辱和輕蔑，仍是可以的。這樣的事情在現社會中已經很流行的了。我們若把這問題當作大問題來討論，這就恰恰表示我們一定要堅守女子的一切，而不管它是不是應當堅守，是不是有關於婦女解放之現實利益，這就是狹隘的婦　　女主義的觀點。</p>
<p>我看了這期「婦女共鳴」，却來了這許多批評，但並非告訴讀者不要去讀它。其實就它的整個傾向來說，在婦女刋物中仍是比較進步的，一般的對現實不滿和社會黑暗面的　般的反抗節緒之表現，仍是具備得有的。就是略爲表現得有些婦女中心思想，但這是女子數千年來被壓迫的憤憊的情感之自然流露，我們亦應相當地加以原諒。不過爲愛惜該刋起，我希望他在精神上和主張上再前進一步，完全掃除這些缺點，更充分地表現它的鬥爭精神和正確的理論觀點。</p>

<h3 id="c184">英國議會的風習 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 微全</p>
<p>誰都知道英國是最先發生產業革命的國家，是議會政治的故鄉，但就它的社會制度，風俗人情，一切的一切看來，却可說是最保守的國家；所謂「老大英國」的稱呼便是它的保守性之一般的表明。這樣的保守性就在它的議會中也可見到。</p>
<p>第一，英國現在還有皇帝。當議院行開院式時，英王及王后卽要乘着以黃金和玻璃裝飾的馬車，駕臨上院。貴族也依各人的等級和勳位的差異而穿着不同的華麗的禮服，戴着不同的禮帽，來到議塲；同時，貴族夫人們也得特別許可參加這開院的儀式，她們都穿著嵌了寶石的更華麗的禮服。因此，議院的開院儀式絢爛奪目，莊嚴盛大，爲世界其他各議會政治國家所不及。</p>
<p>第二，本來在最初的時候，英國的議會是利用的禮拜堂，所以直到現在，那時禮拜堂的許多禮儀都還保存着。例如議員出入議塲的時候，必要向議長席點頭致敬，這在目前可說是對議長的敬意表示；但實際上，這種情形却是最初的議會利用禮拜堂時代的一種禮儀。因爲那時在議長之前的祭壇上有耶穌聖像，所以議員們必要向之致敬禮；現在雖沒有祭壇，也沒有耶穌聖像，但保守的英國人却仍死死地保留着過去的那種禮儀，所以議員出入議塲時依舊要向議長席點頭致敬。</p>
<p>第三，上院和下院開會時的情形也有許多不同的地方。如在開始演說的時候，上院並不呼喚議長，馬上就呼喚貴族和上院議員們，但下院却必須先呼議長。又如上院議長在爭論時並不能决定發言人的先後，所以往往發生兩人同時講話的事；而且就在兩人同時講話的現象發生時，上院議長也無權决定誰可居先講話，這甚至要由全體議員投票來解决的；但下院的議長權利却與我們通常所見的會議主席相同，是與前者相反的單單就這兩種情形看來，我們或可說「老大英國」的貴族比它的市民更要「民主」，「自由」，但同時也可說這是繼承了過去尊貴的英國貴族的一種會塲習慣而表現出來的。</p>
<p>第三，一般說來，無論那一個國家，在比較盛大的議塲中，所有的參加者必然都是要脫帽的。但就是在目前英國議會開會時，議員們坐着時也並不脫帽，只是起立時才取下帽子。這種情形一看雖然很簡單，不值得注意，但實際上却是有其歷史根源的。原來英國議會第一回召集會議時，參加的有貴族，僧侶，市民；這中間的貴族們爲要表示自己優越的身份，便故作大模大樣的神氣，不脫下帽子來；而當時初出的市民雖然反對貴族，但爲要表示自己的紳士氣分，也都不知不覺地模仿了貴族們的某些氣派。上述的目前英國議會中的那種情形，便是由過去保守下來的。</p>
<p>第四，英國的議會政治現在雖有了幾百年的歷史，但在開會時的那種「Hearl　　Hearl」的呼聲，直到現在還是如起初一樣地保存着。對於一種議案，對於發言者的主張，無論是熱烈的喝采，好意的贊成，或憤怒的反對，痛烈的侮辱，刻毒的諷刺議員們都呼着「Hearl　　Hearl」來表示，只不過呼時的音調由於各人的傾向之差異而有所不同罷了。</p>
<p>最後要說的，是在英國議會開會時，那有名的倫敦大鐵塔卽要明着燈亮。因爲在過去英王還有較大權力時，很有可能暴力壓迫議會，英國人民爲要防備這樣的壓迫，所以便在這鐘塔上安置大的燈亮；在議會開會時如那燈亮是光明的，會議卽很安全；反之，如那燈亮總減了，會議卽遭受了壓迫，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>因而倫敦市民卽可起來抵禦。這種情形，本來是在過去時代所有的，但富於保守性的英國人直到現在還保留着。所以我們在倫敦，只要一見那大鐘塔的燈光明亮了，便知道英國議會是在開會了，無待乎看報紙的。</p>

<h3 id="c185">論獎勵生育 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 西門</p>
<p>據台前報載：蘇聯已草定新法制，以期增高生殖率，其中有　打胎爲罪行，　一家中有兒女八人九人十人十一人者，其母每年由國家給予津貼費，每　兒定二千盧布，十一人之外，每一兒給五千盧布，　將幼稚院增至三百，俾共能容二百四十萬兒童，　禁止未得雙方同意而離婚。新法制之目的，志在使俄國戶口於二十五年內增至三萬萬人，據最近戶口調査，其總數僅稍逾一萬六千二百萬人。</p>
<p>在另一方面，我們又時常看到德國和意大利也在努力獎勵生育。政府對於生育多盼婦女也特別給予津貼，並用各種褒獎的方法；而同時對於那些已屆成年的男女尙未結婚者，或輕易離婚，或隨意打眙者，都加以處罰。</p>
<p>從這獎勵生育的事實看來，好像世界上是很景氣的樣子，需要多的人口來從事生產，工作，决戚不到有「人滿爲患」，「人浮於事」的情景。但是，如果從另一方面來看，則又是到處都見到失業的恐慌，人口的過剩，而且每年由饑荒窮困而至於流離死亡的，又不可勝計。照生殖率和死亡率一比較下來，全世界的人口總數恐怕不但沒有增加，而且反而在日形减少吧。那麼這不是一種很矛盾的現象嗎？一方面努力獎進生育，而一方面又聽其流離死亡。與其一方面增加生殖，還不如設法减少不正規的死亡好呢！</p>
<p>由於馬爾薩斯的人口定律，許多不明白社會規律的人，眼見動勞大衆之生殖浩繁而又無法撫養，便牛出許許多多的節制生育論來，如山額爾夫人便是其中之一。她們以爲窮苦人家之不能養育兒童，是由於其隨意生產，不加節制之所致。生殖應該視自己的經濟條件而定。卽是說有錢人才能多多牛產，因爲他有力可以養活；沒錢的人便應節制生育，或者頂好是不要生育。反之，又把生殖繁多，把不節制生育看做是不能養活的原因，以爲節制便是根本補救之方。但是事實是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>我們來看，德國和意大利的獎勵生育，其用意是在準備二决世界大戰。因為第一次大戰的經騐告訴他們，在戰爭中是要消耗無數的入口，又需得源源不絕地人口的供給的，這正同在大戰中需要大量的砲彈和軍需品一樣，所以他們的獎勵生殖，並不是爲人民本身着想，而是爲了侵略弱小民族和將來大戰的準備，預備加工趕造大批的肉彈。然而實際上資本主義發展到了現階段，是只會製造失業，製造戰爭，决不能令人口自然增加的，牠只是减少入口，毀滅人口而已。</p>
<p>但蘇聯的情形比較上又略略不同一點，據牠的國內生產情形看來，似乎只見生產力之上升，勞動者的生活水準之提高，失業者之絕跡，而且因爲工業生產之猛進，便需要大批的勞動者。所以牠的鼓勵生殖是爲了經濟之發展，是經濟發展了的結果。</p>
<p>原來，人口問題决不單純是一個生物學上的間題，而且也是一個社會學上的問題‘在甚麽經濟制度之下，就有甚麽樣的人口法則。决不是節制生育所可解决的，也决不是不按照經濟生產情形而爲了旁的目的的獎勵生殖所可解决的，要生育之合理化。只有在合理的經濟生活之中。</p>

<h3 id="c186">木炭窰 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 炭工</p>
<p>浙江昌化縣通訊</p>
<p>自從木炭汽車在我國內地公路行駛如飛以後，國人們也逐漸注意到木炭產地方面去了。浙江同江西兩省本來多山，又係公路極有成續的地區，所以行駛於公路的公共汽車，也大量採用木炭做燃料。本文所述的昌化木炭窰，它和於潛鄰境都是產量極豐的地方。</p>
<p>昌化縣城居浙省西部，汽車由省垣杭州直達，計程一三二公里。縣境爲　山少田區域，民俗勤樸，生活簡陋，農民僅能依山溪之地爲耕地，故稻榖產量尙不敷一縣民食。荒地又多係畸零散處，墾殖不易，由是多向山嶺發展，因而農民均以在山嶺上樵採種植爲唯一出路。且山土含沙性，森林菓樹，層密茂盛。共中木炭原料，允稱富饒。夾汽車道之山嶺上，以松杉木最多；標，楓，紫，柏，黃樘，波絲等樹决之。炭的原料，以標樹最佳，楓等雜樹决之，松樹又决之，然成炭後之燃燒功效，則各有所長。</p>
<p>標樹有白，靑，紅，麻栗之分，統稱麻栗。就中以白栗爲最佳。白栗有大小，燒成之炭卽有大小烏崗炭之稱。白栗性堅質重，成炭後擊之，可發金聲，入水亦下沉。炭心以有細裂紋者爲最優，其燃燒時所發之火力，倍於松炭，故價亦最昂。烏崗炭，係衢州人所發明，至今僅十四年，出產頗爲豐富。徽州，瑞昌產量亦多。惟昌化縣因烏崗銷路有限，故其每年產量僅佔總炭產量十分之一而已。靑栗有大小靑葉之稱，大靑性質較小靑爲堅重，爲靑炭中之最佳者。燃功稍遜於崗炭，售價亦比崗炭略低，然售炭者並無大小靑葉炭之別名，而統稱爲靑炭。紅栗爲栗中之最决者，向無紅栗炭名稱，大多攙入靑炭與雜炭中售之。至若雜炭原料，則名目繁多，如黃樘，波絲，楓，紫，柏等樹煉成之炭皆屬之，統稱爲雜炭，惟槪別爲大小雜炭而已。大雜炭因原料粗大，煉炭不易，窰火過猛，則炭成段塊，故又稱毛塊，又因雜樹性質輕鬆不堅，成炭後，燃燒發爆，入水卽浮，俗呼爆炭，又名浮炭，其銷數不及小雜炭之廣。小雜炭原料係揀雜樹中性質最佳之楓樹，波絲，靑柴樹等煉成。炭身細而長，可充靑炭，故其銷路亦最大，在全年總產銷數內雜炭要佔十分之七；惟其售價每視炭重計値，並不因炭之大小而分貴賤也。松炭原料中亦有柏樹攙入。松炭雖亦有大小之別，而其性質則同。松炭質鬆易燃，火熖人　，燃時短促，故無耐力，烹煮食物，稍不經意，卽受焦損，家庭中用之者頗稀，多由爐冶坊，糕餅舖，錫舖購用之。年來用松炭店舖因營業衰落，需要减少，故松炭產消數僅佔總炭產量十分之二。</p>
<p>木炭在市塲上發售時，共名號的有七種，卽高帽白標炭（卽烏崗炭），平簍雜炭，高帽靑標炭，元底雜炭，小簍雜炭，大簍松炭，小簍松炭等是也。</p>
<p>燒煉木炭一次，爲時需三日有半，可產炭六百四十斤。以六個工人計，每工四角，每天共計二元四角，三日半共計工洋八元四角，合每斤炭本一分三厘零。每担（小雜炭每担重三十二斤）四角一分六，另加逛價，裝簍工，挑力，運</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，共計二角，每担總註七角一分六，而現售每担僅値五角，凈虧二角一分六</p>
<p>炭窰由炭商集資合造，炭窰工人亦係隨時僱定。此種小規模資本營業，只須五百元資本郎可獨自設窰；然設炭窰必先覓定揀炭山地位，並與山主訂立租的。炭山租價亦不昂，十里方圓內之炭山，租價最多僅爲七十元至一百元；惟山主與炭商訂的時，山主得要求山上所有古木菓樹及成材之樹木，限制砍傷，此在炭商亦多樂予接受，因砍伐大樹，工資旣大，時間又費，且燒炭原料，其樹身以二寸五分至三寸者爲最佳，樹幹宜細，性質以堅靭爲主，大樹旣不易煉，成炭之後，亦不耐燃，故炭商對此種樹材，並不注重。至山地租價，雖視炭山出水之遠近而論租値，然年來炭銷不振，離水過遠之炭山，其山主竟願不收租價，以召炭商設窰採燒，因俟樹木砍盡，山主卽可改種六榖食物。故租山設窰，雙方均得利益也。現在山主更有活動辦法，自築炭窰，使炭商可隨時購料燒煉，惟最少須煉炭一百擔，山主所得利益，照每擔取費五分計算，所以炭之原料及地租，所値皆甚微少，所重者惟在工資耳。</p>
<p>至於炭窰之數，昌化縣治有四區，原分爲十二都。自二都併入三都，六都併入七都後，合計僅有十都。除南區有水綫相隔，其他三區全係高山森林，木炭原料遍地可拾。其中以一都三都十二都產炭最盛，而炭窰亦以此三處爲最多。炭窰在民國二十年有三百四十餘座，二十一年尙有一百六十餘座，二十二年一百三十餘座，迨至二十三年祇百十餘座。據炭商言，今年恐尙不足四十座，炭業之衰落，於此益可了然。</p>
<p>建築一窰至少須產炭五百擔，方不致虧及預計之成本，吾則窰工亦不願後工。造窰之初，首先伐樹以備建造工人住屋及窰亭之用，繼乃開闢分路，俾已採伐之樹條可由此種分路推落而至於窰邊久故分路必須與窰基相連接。分路開闢後，一方砍伐樹木，一方起築炭窰。炭窰材料以黃泥爲主，木料僅供建造窰亭之用。每築一窰，約需二十日可成，造價計七八十元，惟工人築窰，除工資外須另加酒資。炭窰形狀，各處不同，有方式有圓式，而昌化縣則以鯽背式著名。造窰工人多縉雲籍，而最著名者實推衢州人。至炭質之優劣，胥視炭窰造法之精拙，故炭窰實爲炭商所重視也。</p>
<p>製炭，首將所有樹幹或枝條截成長的二尺餘，曝晒三四日，視樹漿滲入中心，卽可推入窰內燒煉。原料燒進一步，則此步之窰背上所設二天母洞卽有白烟透出。迨白烟旣無，卽知此步原料業已燒過，隨用泥蓋閉些二天母洞。迨六個天母洞閉盡，則原料亦已全部燒過。如此費二十四小時之火功，尙須在窰悶閉半日。至餘熖將盡時，卽逐啟炭門，將木炭扒出，用炭屑炭沙悶熄餘火，再經六小時許，始可裝入炭簍。窰上工作前後的需三日，可出小簍炭二十擔。每擔小簍以三十二斤計，共出炭六百四十斤，所費原料則爲四千二百斤。至所餘炭屑應盡量拖凈，以便製煉第二次木炭前，窰內火氣易於退盡也。其前後兩次製煉相隔時間最少需經一日，故煉炭以在春秋二季最爲合宜。</p>
<p>窰工多來自嚴州，處州，台州，溫州。本縣工人祇占十分之三·至工人總數，因窰數無定，未能詳査。大的最多時爲一千九百人；最少時爲一千三百人。窰上工作雖有窰工，刀工，挑工之別，但此三項工作及窰頭腦均係按日輪流工作，其工資亦相等。民國二十年前普通每夫每工一元，二十一年尙有六七角，現僅有三角至五角。惟出水挑炭之工資，仍項視出水遠近隨時雇人時的定之。其輸出，則多由炭商雇船自運。</p>

<h3 id="c187">古典戲劇的再演出 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 林子從</p>
<p>近來中國的話劇運動似乎比較活躍。事實的表現是最近不僅有許多新的劇團產生，而且還有不少的名劇公演。但全般看來，最近演出的戲劇，比較引人注意的大多是些有名的古與劇作，很少現代中國產生的新劇本。如不久公演過的「娜拉」，「欽差大臣」，「茶花女」以及傳說將要公演的契柯夫和奧斯特羅夫斯基的劇作都可說是古典的東西。這樣，便引起了某些機械頭腦的人的議論，他們的眼睛一看到「古」字，腦筋馬上就想到了目前中國退後的復古運動，說道：目前中國的盛演古典戲劇，這便是中國戲劇運動與當前的整個復古浪潮合流的表現；所謂新的戲劇運動已在向後退了！其實呢？問題並沒有這樣簡單。</p>
<p>我們知道，在人間還未進化到自由的王國以前，各時代各社會的人的生　雖有本質的不同，但在某些地方却有類似之點。因此，反映入類生活的藝術，雖要受時代社會的制的，但社會人爲了現實生活的需要，却是有可能借用產生於別的時代社會的藝術作品的。在這個可能之下，歷史上曾有許多復活或再用過去時代的藝術品的事。但這復活或再用並不一定就是復古，開倒車的表現；問題必要由所復活或再用的藝術之思想內容來判定：如果那復活或再用的藝術是與當時的後退思想相結合的，那這復活或再用的意義便是開倒車；反之，假使它與當時的進步思想在某一點上相合，有促進社會前進的功能，那便有進步的意義。因此，我們不能一見復活或再用過去時代的藝術，便無分辨地斥爲復古，開倒車。如文藝復興時期，可以說整個時代的文藝，文化運動，都在復活古代精神，但我們不能說文藝復興運動是開倒車的；因爲這運動是新興市民用來打破中世紀的黑暗，是他們開始創立近代文化的表現，實有新的進步意義。戲劇是藝術的一個分野，對於復活或再演過去時代劇作的事，當然也要依據那復活或再演的劇作之思想內容來評價，不能一槪斥爲復占，開倒車。</p>
<p>依據上面的原則的解說，我們更可具體地來談一談最近中國所演出的幾種古典劇作。如大家所熟知的「娜拉」和「欽差大臣」，雖然是十九世紀的舊的劇作，但它們在目前中國的演出却有很新的意義：「娜拉」的反對舊的道德·法律·宗敎，「欽差大臣」的諷刺舊官僚，每一個中國人看了，都可以想到中國的現實的情形，發生新的思想和感情乃至新的行動。這樣，如果槪括地說目前中國所演出的古典戲劇都含有復古氣味的，那不僅是機械的形式的說法，而且客觀上是在把新舊思想混在一起，使人認不淸楚，並阻礙大家的前進。</p>
<p>自然，近來中國的盛行演出古典戲劇也不是偶然的，這與當前的復古潮流的確也有關係；但這關係却不是「正」的而是「反」的。依我們看來，在當前的復古潮流之下，除了「考古」，「復古」，「以古非今」外，是什麽都不能談的，所以爲客觀現實所急需的新的偉大劇作根本就產生不出來，卽使產生了出來也沒有公演的可能？所以戲劇運動者才不得不在外國的舊紙堆裏努力去找，找那與新的思想在某一點上相合的偉大的古典劇作來上演。如果要說目前中國的再演舌典戲劇與當前的復古潮流有關係，那這關係卽在此；因而我們也就不能將這「關係」二字解釋成爲「合流」，說這現象本身就是復古。</p>
<p>此外，在目前再演曾表現了某一時代的眞實的偉尺的古典劇作，在藝術之史的發展上還有重大的意義。這也是不，能抹煞的。</p>
<p>不過，正因為再演出的古典劇作的意義，主要地是要由其思想內容來判斷，所以我們便不能無條件地說只要是古典劇作就是好的，見着一本古典劇作就把它搬上舞臺。因爲在古典戲劇中，也有一些虛偽的，頹廢的，後退的毒品，如果把那些舊的毒品搬到新的舞台上來，那是會將其毒質廣播於觀衆的；我們應該站在現實的立塲，選擇那爲當前中國所需要的有進步意義的古典劇本來公演。</p>
<p>在目前中國的情形下，如奧斯特羅夫斯基的「貧非罪」，易卜生的「社會棟樑」，「國民公敵」，乃至歌德的「浮士德」，霍普特曼的「日出之前」，「織工」等，有條伴地說，在某一點上都與中國的現實需要相合，都可再演。此外，關於民族解放的古典戲劇，更爲當前中國所急需，戲劇運動者應該努力去找這樣的劇本；如果找不到適當的，更當以歷史的或現實的題材來編作。我想，如像麒麟童所編演的京劇：「明末遺恨」，便是頗有意義的；假如有入能照這種辦法，以吳三桂勾引淸兵入關那一類的歷史事實爲題材，編成新的話劇，那意義不消說是更大的。至於像「茶花女」那樣的缺少積極意義的東西，我以爲還是不演的好。</p>
<p>復次，在演出方面也要特別注意。我們的再演古典戲劇，不能機械地把它當作古典的東西搬運上臺了事；而是應該站在現實的立塲，批判地現實地演出的。最近日本新協劇團公演了「浮士德」，劇本的翻譯者久保榮氏所企圖的卽是：「着力在以現實中義的手法去再檢討古典文學，而給詩聖歌德以現代的評價。」他說：「浮士德與靡非士特，不是抽象的善與惡的對比，而是以此二人的戲劇的行爲，表現出對於封建主義的社會的反抗之兩種不同的形態」（見第十八期「留東新聞」」。由是，他們便在使「浮士德」的演出能有大的現實意義一點上努力了。我以爲一切有新意義的古典戲劇的演出都應該在這一點上努力。必要時，我們甚至可以相當更改劇作的某些塲面的情景和對白，乃至地名和人名，使之更適合於當前中國現實的情景和需要，以加强其現實的意義和價値；自然，這種更改，必要在不傷害原作的眞意和它的藝術價値之下去進行，我們也反對在「現實意義」的美名之下去胡亂更改偉大的古典劇本，使之成爲俗流的東西，以侮辱作者，愚弄觀衆！</p>

<p>Does not discuss any specific issues; Minister of Finance Machida will exchange views</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Three-Minister Conference held on the 5th focused on the China issue and exchanged views. Regarding Sir Otto Niemeyer's visit to Japan, the Foreign Minister explained Niemeyer's mission, stating that Niemeyer's visit does not involve any special financial issues. If Niemeyer proposes providing financial assistance to China, Japan, due to its special relationship with North China, cannot engage in detailed discussions on specific matters. Both Foreign Minister Terauchi and Finance Minister Nagano expressed their agreement. The three ministers concluded that Japan has a special relationship with China, especially in North China, and that it must consider Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo relations and Japan's position as a stabilizing force in East Asia. Therefore, Japan cannot, like Great Britain, handle the issue of smuggling in North China and other general issues from a purely economic standpoint. However, they agreed to express a friendly attitude towards Niemeyer's visit and not refuse to discuss general, abstract issues. (Domei News Agency Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sir Otto Niemeyer plans to meet with Minister of Finance Machida and other Japanese financial leaders to exchange views. As Niemeyer will be taking back an important report that could determine Britain's economic policy towards China, his meeting with Minister of Finance Machida is not just a formal courtesy. There will be a considerable exchange of specific opinions regarding the future economic policies of Britain and Japan towards China and the Chinese government's new economic policy. Minister of Finance Machida plans to explain to Niemeyer the close economic relationship between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, the protection of Japanese interests in North China, the Foreign Ministry's active stance on its continental policy, and the Japanese financial community's guiding role in developing that policy. He will also express the Japanese government's willingness to provide moral support to China's new currency system if the Chinese government sincerely implements Sino-Japanese cooperation. Finally, he will emphasize that Japan's economic policy towards China is not intended to deliberately hinder other countries' policies towards China and solicit Niemeyer's views on this matter.

<p>Eldest Son, Barely Seven Years Old, Also Dies After Treatment; Li's Coffin Moved Out the Back Window, Fortunately Unharmed</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Yesterday was Li Shengda's first seventh-day ceremony, and people from all walks of life came to pay their respects. At 10 PM, there was a light rain, and the floral wreaths and elegiac couplets given by various parties were moved to the outer corridor in front of the spirit. Around 12 AM, monks and Taoists were chanting scriptures and burning paper money, which accidentally ignited the floral wreaths and other items, causing a fierce fire. At that time, Li's wife, Madam Wang, and his son Wenlong, who was barely seven years old, were keeping vigil beside the spirit. Family members rescued the son, but the wife had not eaten for several days and insisted on committing suicide and refused to come out. She was finally pulled out, but her body was completely burned. The son and wife were rushed to the hospital, but due to severe injuries, she died at 10 AM this morning. The son is also in critical condition and unlikely to survive. Yan [Xishan] was extremely saddened by the news and instructed that a coffin be prepared at the hospital for the burial. In the morning, the coffin was moved to the residence. Li's coffin was moved out the back window during the fire and was fortunately unharmed. The fire caused extensive damage in Li's courtyard, but the house itself was not affected. The wife was thirty years old and from the same hometown as Li. The eldest son, Wenlong, and the youngest child were only two years old. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain financial expert stated that the law stipulating that the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications should buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions was intended to stabilize foreign exchange rates and provide greater security for international trade. For the past six months, the government's established parity for foreign exchange has remained largely stable, greatly benefiting international trade. Recently, a small number of individuals who disregard national interests, seeing slight fluctuations in the international financial market, have been buying large amounts of foreign exchange even though they do not actually need it. We greatly admire the three banks' commitment to maintaining the government's promises and continuing to accommodate their supply and demand without restriction. However, we sincerely hope that the government will investigate the purpose of these individuals' purchases of foreign exchange to prevent the flight of Chinese capital.

<p>(Nanjing) The Banque Franco-Chinoise previously stated that the interest received under the terms of the 5% 100 million franc Sino-French Industrial Loan agreement of 1930 was sufficient to cover the interest due for the first installment of the total loan, i.e., the interest for this year. They requested permission from the Ministry of Finance to purchase 2.5 million paper francs and transfer them to the creditors. The creditors, due to the depreciation of the paper franc, demanded that the interest be calculated in gold francs and litigated the matter with the bank in the Seine District Court in Paris. The court ruled that the interest could be paid in paper francs.

<h3 id="e30">The National Legal Community's Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Although the wrongful imprisonment compensation movement launched by the national legal community to protect human rights has only been around for a short six years, its effects have not only attracted the attention of all sectors, but also resulted in a resolution by the National Judicial Conference to have the Judicial Yuan promptly consult the Legislative Yuan to enact wrongful imprisonment compensation laws and regulations to protect human rights. Today, the Shanghai Bar Association held a joint publicity campaign with various sectors to expand the wrongful imprisonment compensation movement and urge the government to enact laws and regulations as soon as possible. This is a very commendable effort.</p>
<p>The composition of wrongful imprisonment is due in part to defects in the law itself and in part to improper application of the law. The former falls within the scope of legislation, while the latter falls within the scope of justice. The wrongful imprisonment compensation that the national legal community advocates refers to the latter. The fundamental reason for the formation of wrongful imprisonment in the judiciary is the violation of justice in the trial. Judicial trials must be based on the requirements of justice, using the power of action to promote the realization of fair and reasonable judgments. Our country's judicial system is not yet perfect. There are indeed many judicial officials who are honest and law-abiding and who adjudicate cases based on justice. However, there are also those whose academic qualifications are insufficient and who do not use justice as the standard for interrogating and deciding cases. This has resulted in many judicial wrongful imprisonments.</p>
<p>Wrongful imprisonment should be compensated based on the state's civil liability. In the past, during the era of autocracy, it was generally believed that the state was the private property of the imperial family, and the emperor had the prerogative to grant life and death to the people. There was no concept of civil liability. Therefore, when Emperor Gaozong of Song gave innocent people the money and rice they needed to return home, it was merely an act of imperial grace and could not be regarded as state wrongful imprisonment compensation. Today, people's concept of the state is different from that of the past. The state is a collective of people's political life, an agency that manages all affairs for the people. Its behavior is merely an aggregate of private individuals, and the responsibility for its actions should be equal to that of ordinary legal persons. Therefore, modern states, with the exception of diplomatic acts, suppression of disturbances, and other acts necessary for national defense that are exempt from civil liability, must bear civil liability for all other acts. The judiciary is one of the state's agencies for managing people's affairs. Judicial affairs are one of the state's ways of managing people's affairs. Its nature is not much different from that of administrative acts. Therefore, the state should bear the responsibility for compensating for its illegal acts that harm the people.</p>
<p>Since wrongful imprisonment compensation is necessary, advanced legal countries, whether in public law or private law, provide compensation for damages caused to the people by the exercise of power by their agencies. For example, Norway, France, and Italy have all stipulated wrongful imprisonment compensation systems in their criminal procedure laws. Germany, Austria, and Japan have enacted separate laws to regulate the state's compensation system in criminal matters. Although England and the United States do not have codified laws to rely on, their case law stipulates that the state should bear the responsibility for compensation in criminal matters in many cases. As for our country, the current laws and regulations do not yet have provisions for wrongful imprisonment compensation. In view of this, the National Lawyers Association initiated the wrongful imprisonment compensation movement in 1931. The National Judicial Conference convened by the Judicial Yuan last September also accepted this movement and resolved to request the Judicial Yuan to consult the Legislative Yuan to enact wrongful imprisonment compensation laws as soon as possible. This shows that our country's wrongful imprisonment compensation system has already begun to take shape. If the national legal community can continue its efforts, it will not be difficult to urge the legislative authorities to adopt it into our country's legal code soon.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the role of wrongful imprisonment compensation can only remedy wrongful imprisonment after it has occurred and cannot prevent its occurrence. Its remedy is passive. As for active relief, it lies in preventing the occurrence of wrongful imprisonment, and the method of preventing the occurrence of wrongful imprisonment lies first in seeking the perfection of the judicial system and strictly defining the meaning of legal terms. Therefore, we sincerely hope that legal professionals, while engaging in the wrongful imprisonment compensation movement, will make greater efforts to improve the judicial system as a means of active relief.</p>

<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum presented a bill to the parliament today, approving the demands of 600,000 striking workers nationwide, similar in nature to the American "New Deal." (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum announced the new government's policy guidelines in the Chamber of Deputies today. All legislation will have a strong socialist character, and he urged the parliament to pass it before the summer recess, after which detailed regulations will be announced by order. The Radical Party held a meeting this morning and unanimously decided to support Blum's policy guidelines, so Blum will surely obtain a majority in the Chamber of Deputies. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The declaration of the cabinet's policy guidelines, typed on seven pages, is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>"Regarding domestic affairs, the cabinet has decided to act quickly to initiate reforms in both spirit and substance, in order to meet the expectations of the entire nation. It will prepare and submit legal bills to both houses of parliament next week, requesting their immediate consideration and vote. These legal bills are divided into: amnesty for political prisoners; implementation of a 40-hour work week; allowing trade unions to represent workers and sign labor contracts with employers; one week of paid annual leave for workers; a large-scale public works program; nationalization of military industries; reorganization of the Banque de France; and amendment of certain legal decrees."</p>
<p>In addition, the entire tax system will also be revised to allow production and commerce to intensify work and the economy to recover. "In short, the cabinet has decided to restore and preserve the true republican spirit in all administrative organs."</p>
<p>As for the state of national finances, Finance Minister Auriol will report the true economic and financial situation to the nation within a few days.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy, the French nation will work together with all countries in the world for peace. "For peace, and respect for international law and international treaties, and the fulfillment of promises, are mutually beneficial. It is hoped that after the collective security mechanism is organized, all countries in the world can end the arms race." (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Blum read the declaration of the cabinet's policy guidelines in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, while Associate Prime Minister Daladier read it in the Senate. Both houses were packed with people. Left-wing members of parliament frequently applauded, while right-wing members listened intently. When the Prime Minister declared in the Lower House that military industries should be nationalized, the right-wing members of parliament showed slight signs of agitation, and the left-wing members of parliament immediately shouted, "Arms merchants, shut your mouths! Defeated generals, shut your mouths!" The Senate meeting was very quiet. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a State Council meeting this morning and decided to appoint Rabier, President of the Court of Audit, as the President of the Banque de France, and to appoint the incumbent President, Tannery, as Honorary President. Rabier is one of France's most famous financial experts and a long-time friend of Prime Minister Léon Blum. His appointment as President of the Banque de France had been anticipated by financial circles two weeks ago and was not considered surprising. The State Council then approved the declaration of the cabinet's policy guidelines, which Prime Minister Léon Blum and Associate Prime Minister Daladier will read simultaneously in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new French government has encountered thorny issues of strikes and gold outflows from the start. Today, gold worth 320 million francs was shipped to New York on the steamer Deutschland. In total, gold worth $125 million has been shipped to the United States in the past six weeks, causing the devaluation of the franc to be discussed again. The government is now working hard to resolve the labor unrest. The number of striking workers has now exceeded 500,000. After meeting with cabinet members for two hours, Prime Minister Blum issued a statement saying that the government is determined to do its utmost to promote a satisfactory resolution of the strike. The cabinet also passed the new government's policy statement today, which will be submitted to parliament for a vote on Saturday. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The London Exchange News reported that Britain and the United States had informally agreed that the two countries should take joint action when France abandons the gold standard. U.S. Treasury Department officials do not believe this statement. Although the authorities have remained silent on the matter, one official stated that if Britain and the United States had agreed on a joint action plan, then Treasury Secretary Morgenthau would have announced it. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(London) Although there is still a strong undercurrent of panic in the foreign exchange market, today the pressure on gold coins has eased, and traders' minds have been slightly calmed. However, the position of the franc has not improved. Speculators are taking a resolute wait-and-see attitude because they believe that the French government will implement severe monetary regulations and will not immediately lower the value of the currency. Furthermore, it is generally believed that the initial large-scale sale of francs due to labor unrest is now coming to an end. Everyone will pay attention to the efforts of the new French Minister of the Interior, Salengro, to peacefully resolve labor disputes. The broadcast speech given by French Prime Minister Blum is generally regarded as lacking constructive elements. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>(Paris) New Prime Minister Léon Blum, Minister of the Interior Salengro, Minister of National Economy Spinasse, and Minister of Labor Lebas met with a delegation from the Standing Committee of the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) in the evening to discuss the situation of the labor unrest. CGT Secretary-General Stonehouse was also present. It was decided that the government and the CGT would jointly take various measures to ensure that the capital's food supply would not be depleted and that false information would not be spread. Stonehouse gave a radio address that evening, stating that the strike movement was purely occupational in nature, and that striking workers and trade unions must strive to maintain this and not allow it to be mixed with other purposes. Finally, he asked the government to quickly take all necessary measures to end the labor unrest. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Prime Minister Léon Blum's broadcast speech on the resolution of the labor unrest, people's minds were greatly reassured, and it was generally believed that the strike movement could be ended and economic activity could be restored to its original state. The stock exchange has already felt the positive impact, and various securities have shown improvement. Government bonds rose by two francs, and Banque de France shares were quoted at 325 francs. Although foreign securities felt hesitant and uncertain at the opening, they uniformly rose shortly after. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the outbreak of the strike, it has been eleven days without incident. Until yesterday, employees of several discount department stores and shops announced a strike. Although employees of companies transporting newspapers continue to strike, newspapers have switched to using street vendors, and residents can still get a copy in hand without difficulty. Various public utilities, such as tap water, gas, and electricity, are still operating as usual, and there is no shortage of milk or other food. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The total number of striking workers in various industries in the capital area has increased to as many as 210,000 this morning. In the northern provinces, as of this evening, there are 90,000. Workers belonging to the vegetable market in the capital have signed a contract with their employers and are preparing to resume work. In addition, in the newspaper industry, managers of various newspapers belonging to the Popular Front held a meeting in the afternoon to study ways to publish their newspapers as usual. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris City Council, fearing that the strike would affect the food supply of the people, convened an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss it. The Prefect of the Seine, Vile, issued a statement, stating, "There is no need to panic about the current situation. Various public utilities are currently operating as usual. The supply of electricity and gas is not experiencing difficulties. The subway and buses are also operating as usual," etc. Striking workers throughout the city are still avoiding violent actions or conflicts with employers. The police have also not come out to intervene. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>The labor unrest in Dunkirk and Douai, France, continues to expand, with a total of 20,000 striking workers.

However, the electricity required by the city and its surrounding areas can still be supplied normally without interruption. In addition, labor unrest has also occurred in Provin, where the clay extraction workers have also gone on strike. Major stores in the city of Lille, including food stores and department stores, have closed. Workers at major breweries have occupied factory buildings.

<h3 id="e38">British Foreign Secretary Eden Visits Ethiopian Emperor <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Talk Lasts Half an Hour</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden drove to the residence of Shanghai tycoon Sir Victor Sassoon at 2:00 p.m. to visit the Emperor of Abyssinia. The conversation lasted only half an hour before he left. No statement was issued afterwards. Eden's trip was only a courtesy call and lasted a very short time, so the current situation of the Italo-Ethiopian issue would not have been discussed. It is rumored that the Ethiopian Emperor may go to Rome to negotiate with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in person. This news has not been confirmed. Its source comes from one of the following four areas: Ethiopian Minister Dr. Martin is scheduled to host a banquet at the embassy tomorrow to welcome the Emperor, and has invited prominent British figures and members of the diplomatic corps to accompany him. Currently, aside from Chinese Ambassador Dr. Guo Taiqi, Turkish Ambassador Fethi, Japanese Chargé d'affaires Fujii, Iranian Minister Kamara, and British Liberal Party leader Lloyd George, who have agreed to participate, Foreign Secretary Eden has declined twice and will send Undersecretary Lord Cranborne to represent him at the banquet. Ambassadors from other countries, such as France, Russia, Brazil, and Chile, are currently not in London and will send representatives to attend the banquet, which makes the Ethiopian Emperor feel unhappy. Foreign Secretary Eden visited the Ethiopian Emperor today, and at the same time, Minister Martin also met with the head of the Abyssinian affairs section of the Foreign Office, Penderson (the Italo-Ethiopian dispute resolution plan proposed by former French Prime Minister Laval and former British Foreign Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare was drafted by Penderson and Saint-Quentin, assistant head of the African Affairs Division of the French Foreign Ministry). It is rumored that the Ethiopian Emperor is very dissatisfied with the results of the two men's conversation. It has been rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is very willing to contact the Ethiopian Emperor face-to-face, and the Ethiopian Emperor recently gave an interview to a reporter from the Daily Telegraph, saying that his purpose in coming to Europe was to make all conversations more convenient with him present, which is highly valued by the general public. French aviator, the Ethiopian Emperor's aviation advisor, Trouillat (who previously flew to Ethiopia privately, landed in Italy en route, was escorted back to France, and was subsequently released), suddenly came here from France today, so the general public speculates that Trouillat's purpose here is to fly the Emperor to another location. The above points are the sources of rumors from outside. However, according to a statement issued by the Ethiopian Embassy, the Emperor intends to go to Switzerland from here, but does not intend to go to Geneva. British officials are very satisfied with this news. In addition, a British women's organization called the "Peace Crusade" is scheduled to hold a meeting at "Queen's Hall" on the 15th of this month. At that time, the Ethiopian Emperor's daughter, Princess Tsehai, will attend and give a speech. It is said that Princess Tsehai's decision to come to England was at the invitation of that organization. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The chairman of the League of Nations Council, British Foreign Secretary Eden, has suggested to the representatives of the member states of the Council that he intends to choose the 26th of this month as the date for the extraordinary meeting of the Council.

<p>Cleveland: The National Republican Convention is scheduled to open here on the 9th of this month. Hundreds of party members have arrived here today. The Republican Party is preparing to vigorously attack President Roosevelt's New Deal with the slogan "Help So-and-so (the name of the Republican presidential candidate will be filled in after he is nominated) Restore Sanity." Many sources currently predict that Kansas Governor Landon has hope of being nominated as a presidential candidate. However, supporters of another presidential hopeful, Borah, are now denouncing Landon as actually supporting the New Deal and being sponsored by greedy oil monopolists, causing resentment among party members. Landon's comrades are selling Borah himself as an early supporter of President Roosevelt, and that he must have become a member of the Democratic Party. At the same time, supporters of Chicago newspaper publisher Knox are now gathering on Borah's side in an attempt to prevent Landon's election. The various factions are competing fiercely, so it is expected that there will be fierce debate during the voting. Landon's comrades are now claiming that Landon will win in the primary, while opponents criticize him for being overconfident. The convention has a total of 1,001 delegates, of whom about 800 are attending without instructions from any faction. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Jerusalem - The Arab Central Strike Committee has decided to expand the general strike movement, leading to a sense of hopelessness in Palestine greater than ever before. Although the authorities have promulgated new emergency regulations, the Arabs have other new plans, attempting to involve other important businesses in the strike. This move will have even more serious developments. The attitude of the strike leaders is extremely tough. The government insists that negotiations can only begin after the Arabs stop the strike and local security is restored. Their main demand concerns the immigration of Jews into Palestine. In the past few days, although there have only been minor, illegal riots, the situation has become increasingly serious because Palestine is now seen as a "key" by other Eastern countries, and they are all closely watching its developments. According to reliable sources, the people of Syria are also considering the attitude and strategy they should take if the current negotiations in Paris with France on the covenant unfortunately break down. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Jerusalem - The authorities are currently making every effort to prohibit the smuggling of weapons and explosives into Palestine, and confiscate illegally stored firearms, hoping to eliminate terrorist acts. Near Jaffa, two Jews were found to be carrying Mauser pistols. They encountered a team of British-Palestinian police officers, and because they did not obey the police's order to stop and wait for inspection, the police shot them, seriously injuring them. Four Arabs were arrested in the British police camp on Mount Scopus for stealing explosives from a government powder magazine next to the police camp. The authorities have issued an order to summon the reserve forces of the Transjordan Frontier Force to help stop the smuggling of arms. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<p>Emphasis on Agriculture? Emphasis on Industry (Part 2) - Zeng Diguang</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of economic transformation in China, some advocate emphasizing agriculture, some advocate emphasizing industry, and some advocate emphasizing both agriculture and industry. The arguments of each faction are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Advocating Emphasis on Agriculture: The profound agricultural panic and the intense poverty of farmers in recent years have led informed people to believe that the transformation of China's economy must begin with agriculture. In addition to actually participating in rural construction, they have put forward the following arguments to awaken the attention of the people:</p>
<p>(A) China has taken agriculture as the foundation of the country for thousands of years, so developing agriculture is to consolidate the foundation of the country;</p>
<p>(B) The number of people engaged in agriculture in China accounts for the largest majority of the population, so developing agriculture is to seek happiness for the largest majority of the people;</p>
<p>(C) The deepening of China's economic panic is due to the decline of the rural economy, so developing agriculture is a strategy to alleviate China's economic panic;</p>
<p>(D) Under its historical and international environment, China's economic development can only be based on agriculture;</p>
<p>(E) The rural economy is dependent on industry and commerce, so developing the countryside is to consolidate the foundation of industry and commerce;</p>
<p>(F) If the rural economy can be consolidated, rural order can be stabilized, and peasant unrest can be reduced;</p>
<p>(G) If the countryside can be revived, the surplus population in cities can be reduced;</p>
<p>(H) If the rural economy can prosper, financial problems can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Reasons for Advocating Emphasis on Industry: Those who advocate that the transformation of China's economy should emphasize industry believe that "the contribution of muscle-powered production methods to the welfare of the people is definitely not as great as that of mechanized production methods." Therefore, they advocate that the transformation of China's economy should take the road of industrialization. Their main arguments include the following six points:</p>
<p>(A) The economic foundation of all countries in the world is centered on the industrial economy. China's economy is a part of the world economy, so its economic development should also follow this track to avoid falling behind and becoming abnormal.</p>
<p>(B) European and American countries that take industry as the focus of the national economy are all able to become rich and strong. China is in a state of poverty and weakness because its industry is underdeveloped.</p>
<p>(C) The most serious crisis in China at present is caused by the continuous influx of industrial products from the great powers. Therefore, in order to save this crisis, we should quickly revitalize the national industry to resist it.</p>
<p>(D) If industry can develop, we can use all raw materials. As a result, the income of farmers can be increased, rural finance can be enriched, and the livelihood of farmers can be stabilized, thereby stabilizing the foundation of the entire national economy.</p>
<p>(E) It is not impossible to seek China's industrialization. If we can strive to improve production methods, factory management, and humbly adopt the strengths of others, the future will be bright.</p>
<p>(F) If the government and financiers can cooperate effectively with industrialists, there will be no problem in seeking the industrialization of China's economic construction.</p>
<p>On balance, although the reasons listed by the two factions above each have a piece of the truth, both have inappropriate aspects. Those who advocate that China's economic construction should be centered on agriculture deny the absolute necessity of China's economic industrialization due to their adherence to the traditional idea of agriculture as the foundation of the country, which is their most serious mistake. Second, modern economy is centered on industry. If we do not conform to the times and only seek to revive agriculture alone, it is an abnormal restoration movement, which cannot be allowed by the principles of economic development. Third, if agricultural construction is to proceed smoothly, the industrial economy must provide excellent technology, sophisticated machinery, abundant capital, and a large number of talents in order to achieve success. Fourth, even if separate agricultural construction can be realized, it cannot save China's current economic crisis, and it will only become a market monopolized by the great powers. The opinions of those who advocate that the transformation of China's economy should be centered on industry are also inevitably biased and do not pay attention to the following issues: Before the foundation of China's rural economy has been thoroughly changed, it is impossible to thoroughly industrialize China's economic construction; Under the oppression of political and economic violence of the great powers, it is very difficult to revitalize the national industry. The collapse of emerging national industries in recent years can serve as a warning; If China's economic construction is to be centered on industry, there must be sufficient funds to achieve success. China is already so poor, where will the funds come from? The inconvenience of transportation, the oppression of excessive taxes, and feudal exploitation, etc., if they are not quickly eliminated, it will not be easy for China's economic development to focus on industry; If China's economic construction is centered on industry, rural capital will at least temporarily become poor, and peasant unrest will become more dangerous.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the development of China's economy, if only focusing on one aspect, is definitely not the best strategy. Moreover, the current international environment is extremely bad, and we will inevitably encounter endless resistance. Only with the greatest perseverance and the final determination can we proceed on both sides. In rural areas, we should engage in rural transformation work, actively train the people, and strengthen their power, so that the vast peasant masses can unite with each other and develop China's economy. At the same time, in urban areas, we should engage in the construction of small-scale industries, so that the absolute necessities of life can gradually become self-sufficient. Therefore, the foundation of China's national economy should be built on agriculture, and the scope of the economy should be expanded by industry and commerce, complementing each other and not favoring one over the other.</p>

<p>(16) Trivial Talks on the Life of Farmers in Fang County and Zhushan</p>
<p>The reporter came from the north to investigate, with Jun County, Yun County, Fang County, and Zhushan as the destinations, intending to first take a car to Jun County, then transfer to a mountain sedan chair to Yunyang, and then turn to Fang County and Zhushan. Unexpectedly, when he arrived at Shihua Street, which belongs to Gucheng County, the car was anxiously heading north, as if waiting for the car to arrive in Jun County, I don't know when. When I asked at the station, there was no definite answer. They only said that the bridge at a certain place had not been repaired yet. However, if the bridge is repaired, it will take five or six sunny days after the rain to dry the road before traffic can pass. If the weather changes during the road drying period, you have to wait again. The trip to Jun County and Yun County had to be abandoned because of this. As for Fang County, Zhushan and other counties, the roads are dark and winding, and it is impossible to reach them in more than a month. Moreover, ambushes occur from time to time, and there is no guarantee at all, which is also impossible. I had to turn back halfway. Mo Di turned his car around, which was very different from his original intention. However, when I was in Shihua Street, I heard a lot about the living conditions of farmers in Fang County and Zhushan. I would like to record it as follows:</p>
<p>The so-called Fang County and Zhushan refer to Fang County, Zhushan County, and Zhuxi County. The three counties are listed side by side, Fang County is on the left and right, Zhushan is in the middle, and Zhuxi is on the left. They are all mountain countries and belong to the Eighth Administrative Region of Yunyang. Fang County was formerly known as Fangling. Emperor Zhongzong of the Tang Dynasty was deposed and built a city to live here. The territory is second only to Sui County in terms of area, and the length is even more distant. Because it is surrounded by mountains, as solid as a house, it is named the county. It is commonly known as "Fang County at the bottom of ten thousand mountains." It is also eight or nine hundred miles long, but not as wide, so there is a saying that "Fang County is a thousand miles long like a line." Zhushan and Zhuxi were ancient Yong countries, and were divided into two counties until the Ming Dynasty. They are purely agricultural societies. Paddy fields in Fang Prefecture account for one-tenth or two-tenths, and mountains account for eight-tenths or nine-tenths. Calculated in terms of stone, the standard of stone is determined by the amount of planting. The main agricultural products are wheat, beans, and corn. The by-products are black and white fungus, tung oil, raw lacquer, fire paper, gallnuts, medicinal materials, and black fungus, with an annual output of more than 100,000 catties, worth 200,000 yuan. 10,000 baskets of tung oil are worth 100,000 yuan. Paddy fields in Zhushan account for two-tenths, and dry land and barren mountains account for eight-tenths. Corn, wheat, and miscellaneous grains are the main crops, and tung oil and fungus are also abundant as by-products. Cultivated land is calculated in stone, and there is no term for mu. Paddy fields in Zhuxi account for one-third, and mountains account for two-thirds. The products are rice, wheat, potatoes, corn, beans, cotton, and land is also calculated in stone. One stone per tree, converted to one mu of field. Farmers rely on the weather to make a living. There is no convenience for ponds to irrigate. Paddy fields rely entirely on ditch water, harbor water, and rapids. Simple weirs and dams are built to guide irrigation. When the water is cut off, the rice will wither. Mountain land depends more on rainwater. In dry years, there is no relief. However, once it rains, the ridges under the mountains will be flooded, and the sand from the mountains will pour down. In addition to the ridges being crushed, the rivers will also be silted up. In the past, opium was mostly grown in the mountains, but now it has completely disappeared. These places where opium was grown are areas where inspection and eradication committee members or local officials cannot easily reach. The people stopped growing opium voluntarily, not because they were afraid of strict laws, but because the local gentry were inferior and exploited too much, making it not worth the loss. It is also a fortunate thing that the poisonous weeds can be completely eradicated. The mountains are extremely rich in minerals, with all kinds of metals, and especially abundant coal, which is readily available. It is a pity that it has not been mined. Although copper mines were once manually mined, they were soon discontinued. Zhushan has a special mine, which is rich in green stone, which is sold to foreign countries and abroad. Westerners use it to make toys, and lamas use it to make rosary beads, which are very precious. There are many kinds of animals, such as tigers, leopards, wild boars, deer, chickens, deer, and rabbits. Monkeys are especially abundant in the mountains.</p>
<p>Because the counties are covered with mountains and forests are deep, transportation is extremely inconvenient. There are few pedestrians on the road, and they must bring dry food and salt when traveling. Therefore, there are those who grow old and die without contacting each other. The difficulty of the road is described in a proverb: "Lice go backwards, ghosts are worried, and the King of Hell shakes his head three times when he sees it." The bird path in the Silkworm Mountain is hardly enough to compare with this. Farmers in the mountains mostly live alone, and their houses are very simple. Some live in caves, do not light lamps at night, and live with wild animals. In Fang County, one Bao chief covers dozens of miles, and one Lian Bao chief covers four hundred miles. It is extremely difficult to implement government orders. For example, if you summon strong men for training, you can only gather more than ten people in a few days. Villages with dozens of households must be of the same surname and clan. The clan chief must be a bully, like the native officials of ancient times. Those who own guns are like chieftains. Therefore, the district chiefs appointed by the government are all "sitting tigers" of this kind. The government must also listen to their orders. These district chiefs are all sitting tigers, fearing to fall on the plains, and are unwilling to enter the city. They have the concept of "listening to the call but not listening to the announcement." They receive the county government's orders while sitting, which is considered polite. Whether to comply or not is not what they pay attention to, nor is it what the government dares to ask. Generally, matters relating to the county government are handled by representatives from the city office. For example, Zhu Fengzhang, the district chief of Zhushan, is one of them. Now that he has committed a serious crime, the gunmen have been dismissed and he will be purged. Others are still too numerous to remove.</p>
<p>The rural economy is absolutely bankrupt. The food produced is not enough to eat. The by-products such as raw lacquer, tung oil, fungus, and medicinal materials cannot be transported out due to inconvenient transportation. A few farmers do not avoid hardship and carry goods out of the mountains on their shoulders, but it is difficult to transport much. The common currency among the people is still silver dollars. Although legal tender has been introduced, they cannot distinguish between genuine and fake, and they rarely use it. Even in cities, it is impossible to exchange five-yuan legal tender. Therefore, farmers who transport goods out of the mountains must obtain silver dollars to return to the mountains. At this time, when legal tender is being promoted, merchants from other counties deliberately exploit them. They lose 20% or 30% when exchanging goods worth 100 yuan for silver dollars. Now they have changed to trading goods. Foreign goods can be imported continuously, and Japanese goods are especially popular because of their low prices. In remote areas, the economic power of foreigners has penetrated unimpeded, which is worrying.</p>
<p>The life of farmers is extremely difficult. In the past, they had "no half a liter of rice a day and no half a bed at night." In recent years, there have been successive droughts and floods, coupled with the frequent intrusions of Red bandits, bandits, routed soldiers, Yu bandits, Shaanxi bandits, and Sichuan bandits, as well as the long-term demands of native officials and chieftains. Their flesh and blood are exhausted, and their vitality has been cut off. Most farmers do not know what rice is or what salt tastes like. Yesterday in Gucheng, I personally saw telegrams from the garrison in Fang County and Zhushan and from legal groups, saying that tree bark and grass roots have been eaten up. It is probably not a false statement. Also, because very little cotton is produced, some people have never worn cotton clothes in their lives. This kind of life is suspected to be inhuman. The climate in the mountains is unpredictable. It snows in August and does not melt until March of the following year. At the same time, one mountain has four kinds of climates. The top layer is sunny, the second layer has clouds and mist, the third layer snows, and the fourth layer rains. Due to the climate, people roast fire in all seasons and are prone to diseases. The strangest disease is "goiter," which is caused by a certain toxin in the leaves on the trees that fall into the water. When people drink it, they get this disease. At first, there is only a scar under the neck, which gradually grows bigger, even as big as a five-stone gourd, hanging down to the chest. Those who are pierced through the head die. Eight out of ten people suffer from this disease, and they are not surprised because they are used to it. On the contrary, if people from other counties enter the area and see no "goiter," they feel strange. Those who smoke opium do not suffer from this disease. Eating more kelp and applying iodine will also prevent it. Those who are ill can also be cured. The former is the truth, and the latter was invented by people from other counties. However, the locals are very poor, and kelp and iodine are not cheap. Although they know the method, they have no ability to cure it. There is also the disease of rotten eyes. About five or six out of ten people suffer from it, probably because it is contagious due to uncleanliness.</p>
<p>The wheel of time is stagnant in the Middle Ages. The low level of education is also a major reason. The degree of lowness is laughable when heard. Although primary schools are maintained in the county seat, the equipment is simple, teachers are lacking, and there are no new textbooks. The principal of a certain school in Zhushan calls himself a "foreign teacher." Most of the students are over 24 or 5 years old, and some are over 30. Their purpose in studying is not to have the lofty ambition of promoting morality and benefiting the people, nor to have the ambition of being promoted to officialdom, becoming rich, and ennobling their wives and children. They are specially learning to write complaints in order to prepare for lawsuits with others. Therefore, official documents and lawyer drafts are widely collected into books and recited fluently. The land is neither known nor urgent to them. As for rural primary schools, it can be said that there are none at all. Even private schools are few. The number of illiterates accounts for more than 96%. They cannot recognize official documents and announcements.</p>
<p>In summary, in both spirit and matter, the situation of farmers in Fang County and Zhushan is different from that of human beings in the world. The first step in relief is to open up roads and develop transportation, so that culture can be imported and goods can be exported. From here to Fang County, the 82nd Division's engineering unit has repaired the roadbed. Only two mountains have not yet been blasted. If the government and the people continue to build it, it will be completed in time. However, it is difficult to design between the two Zhus. (Sent from Shihua Street on May 18)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Complete Qin Tile Volume Discovered in Zou County, Shandong Province. Many Ocher Pottery Shards Discovered. Han Stone Carvings Also Abundant in Yi County <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence, Zou County is the hometown of Confucius and Mencius, and occupies an important position in the history of women's transformation. The ancient city of Zhu Kingdom is located in the county, along with Teng County and Yi County nearby, all of which were the ancient states of Teng and Xue in the Spring and Autumn Period. In recent years, antiquities have been discovered, mostly from the Qin and Han Dynasties, which are valued by archaeologists. The Han stone carvings and other items currently on display in the Shandong Provincial Library were mostly transported from the Zou and Teng areas and are treasured by the world. Wang Xiantang, the director of the library, recently traveled to Zou County to collect antiquities to help study ancient culture. He returned to Jinan yesterday. According to the results of the Zou trip, a brief record is as follows:</p>
<p>Qin Dynasty Tile Volume Zou County is also known as Ji Wangcheng, which is the capital of the ancient Zhu Kingdom. The remains of the rammed-earth city wall are still intact. Many pottery shards with inscriptions are produced in the city. The most valuable is the Qin Dynasty tile volume, which has an edict of Emperor Qin Shi Huang in the twenty-sixth year, which was printed with ten seals. The calligraphy is ancient. Chen , a famous antique connoisseur and collector from Weixian County in the Qing Dynasty, studied the text on the tile volume and determined that it was written by Li Si with a brush. Therefore, Chen once commented that "the legacy of the prime minister Li Si, the ancestor of soft brushes." According to Qin volumes, weights, and measures, the earliest one seen in the inscription is Yan's Family Instructions from the Sui Dynasty. Later, they were discovered in the Song, Ming, and Qing Dynasties. Archaeologists have also recorded many of them, but they are all made of iron or copper. Later, Chen discovered tile volume pottery shards. After 30 years of searching, he was able to piece together dozens of pottery shards into a complete vessel, which he considered an unprecedented discovery and a rare treasure. Because tile volume shards are only produced in Zou County, it took 30 years to piece together a complete vessel, which is really not easy. Unfortunately, after Chen's death, the volume was purchased by the Japanese. Now, a complete tile volume has been discovered in Zou County, which is intact and has been acquired by the Provincial Library.</p>
<p>Ocher Pottery Shards Pottery shards with ocher and patterns were previously discovered by archaeologists in the ancient city of Yan (northern Jiangsu), which was unique to other places. Therefore, it was considered a unique cultural product of "Yan" city and was greatly valued. Recently, many have also been discovered in Zou County, and they are exactly the same as those discovered in "Yan" city, which can prove that the State of Zhu in the Spring and Autumn Period also produced this object, which is the same as the culture of the State of Yan. The argument that ocher pottery shards are a unique culture of the State of Yan has added a material for archaeologists.</p>
<p>Anyang Han Stele Yi County has Anyang City, which was the capital of Marquis Anyang in the Former Han Dynasty. The locals still call it An Wangcheng. In fact, the marquis was not a king. There is a tomb mountain with seventy or eighty ancient tombs, which are lined up one after another, and the scale is several times larger than the Cao Wang Tomb in Teng County. The tomb pits are all Han Dynasty stone carvings with excellent patterns. The farmers' wall foundations in nearby villages are mostly made of Han stone carvings, which are readily available. The locals do not cherish them very much. However, because there are too many, it is impossible to transport them to Jinan for preservation.</p>

<h3 id="e63">One of the Biology Lectures: The Contribution of Biology to Mankind (Part 1) <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Deyu, Director of the Natural Science Group of the Zhengzhong Book Company Translation Office</p>
<p>In the natural world surrounding us, there are two kinds of things: one is inanimate and the other is animate. The study of the various phenomena of inanimate things is called physical science; the study of the various phenomena of animate things is called biology. Biology did not begin today. More than two thousand years ago, during the most brilliant period of Greek civilization, there was a scholar named Aristotle who began to study various phenomena in biology. However, from Aristotle until the fifteenth century, there was no significant progress or development, because the power of Christianity was too strong at that time, and religion continued to oppress science, causing facts and superstitions to be mixed up. Modern biology took shape in the early nineteenth century, only two hundred years ago. The progress in these two hundred years is like the rising sun in the east. To mention the most prominent ones: the first is the establishment of the cell theory; the second is the proof of biological evolution. These two points are explained separately below:</p>
<p>More than two hundred years ago, the British botanist Robert Hoore cut a thin layer of cork and observed it under a very simple microscope. He discovered that the cork was made up of many honeycomb-like groups, which he called cells. After further research by many scholars, it was also known that the honeycomb-like cells were not empty, but filled with extremely complex substances. In the nineteenth century, the German zoologist Schwann discovered that the animal body was also made up of very small cells. At the same time, the German botanist Schleiden discovered that plant cells and animal cells were generally the same. Thanks to the research of these two scholars, it was only then that animals and plants, which were previously considered unrelated, were fundamentally determined to be passed down from the same ancestor. The mingling of the animal and plant kingdoms has indeed made great progress in human intelligence, and it has also given us the hint that "there is another world under the microscope."</p>
<p>The cell is to the organism as the unit of weight is the gram and the unit of length is the centimeter, and it can be said to be the unit of the organism. Moreover, the cell is not only the source of life phenomena in the organism, but also the heredity phenomenon that children resemble their parents is a function of the cell. Therefore, the focus of research in physiology, genetics, and other branches of biology is concentrated on cells. In other words, the foundation of biology should be built on cells. If the principle of cells is not understood, the function of the living body cannot be understood. Furthermore, if the question of life is not thoroughly studied at the cellular level, it will never be resolved.</p>
<p>The organism is made up of cells, but how are the cells that produce life born? This kind of thought lingers in our minds. Originally, human beings are very smart. All questions that human intelligence cannot explain are often entrusted to heaven and to God in order to shirk his own responsibility. Regarding the life of organisms in the past thousands of years, it was also once entrusted to God. After the progress of cytology, it was only then that we knew that the life of cells cannot be created out of nothing. Only cells can produce cells. In other words, without existing life, it is impossible to discover objects with continued life.</p>
<p>Before the discovery of cells, several scholars knew that there were microorganisms invisible to the naked eye in nature—protozoa or bacteria. More than two hundred and fifty years ago, the Dutchman Leeuwenhoock studied various objects with a toy-like microscope. One day, he took a drop of rainwater and observed it under a microscope. He discovered that countless extremely active minute animals and plants were lurking in the rainwater. He reported this to the academic community, but few people responded. Fortunately, Mr. Lei was wealthy and still worked tirelessly in his research. He finally discovered a method of movement of certain bacteria and protozoa as well as blood cells in the human body. Thus, the world began to know of the existence of microorganisms. At that time, scholars were already deeply convinced that fish were oviparous and beasts were viviparous, which was tantamount to admitting that organisms could only produce organisms. However, after the discovery of microorganisms, witnessing the rapid reproduction of many small organisms in a short period of time, the idea that these small organisms were suddenly generated—created by God—was revived. Although there were one or two outstanding scholars who resolutely opposed it, they had not grasped any solid evidence until the cell theory was established. Afterwards, the structure of the microscope improved, and microorganisms became more and more developed. It was only then that it became clear that microorganisms composed of single cells could not be discovered without seeds. The theory of creation by God was thus self-defeating.</p>
<p>To discuss how life came about and how organisms came about seems to be the idea of the leisure class and has little to do with life, but biology is one of the great contributions to human history, so I would like to specifically discuss the relationship between cell theory and microorganisms:</p>
<p>Leeuwenhoek discovered microorganisms, and then it became clear that microorganisms are also produced by cells. Does this have nothing to do with life? Thirty or forty years ago, the French brewing industry experienced a great panic that almost bankrupted it. That is, the wines and other alcoholic beverages that the French relied on for their lives were all corrupted and could not be recovered. At that time, the famous French chemist Pastenr investigated the cause of the corruption and discovered that the fermentation of well-known wines, wines, and other alcoholic beverages, which was previously unknown, was the action of a type of microorganism called fermenting bacteria. Because of the fermentation of these bacteria, the raw materials for winemaking can be turned into wine. At the same time, he also discovered that there is often an abnormal fermentation phenomenon during brewing, that is, the fermentation is mixed with microorganisms that corrupt the wine, then the finished wine will be corrupt and unsuitable for drinking. Not only is wine like this, but also when the human body or other organic bodies decay, it is nothing more than the action of bacteria. After discovering this phenomenon, Mr. Ba continued to study it and thought that all the diseases of livestock and humans might also be caused by these microorganisms. After countless experiments, he finally understood the relationship between diseases and microorganisms. At that time, the silkworm industry in France also faced a huge problem, that is, silkworms developed a most terrible disease—microparticle disease, which almost caused the silkworm industry in France to collapse. Mr. Ba devoted himself to research and finally discovered that the disease of silkworms was also caused by a type of bacteria. Therefore, he took measures to prevent it and was finally able to save the desperate situation. Later, Mr. Ba also determined the pathogens of tetanus and rabies and heard of the way to treat such diseases by injecting serum. Now we can prevent various infectious diseases in advance and save them afterwards, which can be said to be directly related to the study of Mr. Ba.</p>
<h3 id="e64">All Jiangxi Business Federation Conference. 80 Representatives Attended. All Hope to Relieve the Market <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang correspondence, the closing ceremony of the Jiangxi Provincial Chamber of Commerce Representatives Conference was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 2nd in the main hall of the Association Lane. Sixty-two chambers of commerce out of 119 chambers of commerce in the province, with 80 representatives, and more than 100 guests, including representatives from party and government agencies, as well as executive and supervisory committee members from provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, attended. The ceremony was presided over by Wang Mingxuan, Chairman of the Provincial Business Federation. After the ceremony, Director Li of the Construction Department delivered a training speech, the main ideas of which are: promote a new life, invigorate the spirit, strive for progress to respond to the commercial war, divide labor and cooperate to seek overall development. Subsequently, Yang Qingshan, the representative of Ruijin County, Zhu Lianfu, the representative of Anfu, and Wu Liangji, the representative of Dengjiabu, reported on the decline of commerce in their respective places and made suggestions for relief. After the ceremony, the meeting was adjourned. At 2:00 p.m., the meeting was held to discuss the proposals, from the first to the seventeenth, which were proposed by the entire executive and supervisory committee of the Provincial Business Federation and the Anfu, Nancheng, Ruijin, Hekou, Yugan, Fenyi, Xiajiang, Shiwen, Gaoan, Ruichang, Zhutan, Tangkou, Jian, Linchuan, Suichuan, and other county chambers of commerce. The general content is that the market is depressed, the financial resources are exhausted, and the turnover is inflexible. They requested the provincial government to expand Yumin Bank (provincial) to lend money in various places to carry out relief, and requested the central government to quickly open a real estate mortgage bank to provide turnover. The conference combined these proposals for discussion, and because there were many proposals, it was specially divided into three groups: economy, taxation, and general, to discuss the proposals separately in order to obtain relief methods for the entire provincial market.

<h3 id="e65">Record of the Rupture of the Zhongxiang Xiang Embankment: Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan Counties Entirely Submerged; Embankment Workers All Escaped, Only the Villagers Suffered <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>E Province:</p>
<p>Regarding the ten counties and cities of Zhongxiang, Jingmen, Tianmen, Qianjiang, etc., the sole guarantee of taxation; since the rupture last autumn, the National Economic Council and the Hubei Provincial Government have actively planned repairs. Due to the difficulty of constructing the breach at the third and fourth work sections, a remote embankment was rebuilt, stretching from Jiukou to Luohan Temple, a distance of eighteen and a half kilometers. In addition, a water interception dam and a cutoff dam were built at Xiongjiaqiao, requiring an expenditure of more than 2.7 million yuan, and mobilizing over 100,000 laborers. The scale of the project was unprecedented in the nation. Unexpectedly, after several months of construction, just as it was about to be completed, it was suddenly breached by the Han River on the night of May 26, and the effort was ruined. It is most regrettable. Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan counties have once again suffered disaster. One day after the embankment rupture, the reporter rushed to the work site to inspect the entire embankment and hereby records the situation as follows:</p>
<p>The remote embankment was divided into four work sections, with laborers conscripted from the five counties of Jingmen, Tianmen, Qianjiang, and Hanchuan for construction. The project was considered relatively solid. The fourth section was contracted and constructed by the Zhongxiang Xiang Embankment Engineering Office of the Economic Council. Due to the later start of construction and the difficulty in obtaining materials and the substandard work, cracks appeared even before completion. Although the personnel on the embankment knew the danger of this section, they still hoped that the water level would stabilize and that it could be completed after a considerable period. Unexpectedly, on the 25th, the water level in Yunyang suddenly rose by seven or eight meters, and in Xiangyang, it rose by one zhang (about 3.3 meters). As the warning came, the entire embankment was shaken. At 10:00 AM on the 26th, the head of the water reached the outside of the water interception dam. The momentum was not very strong at first. If timely rescue measures were taken, there was still hope of recovery. However, Xi Dejiong, the Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau and concurrently the Director of the embankment Engineering Office, and Shi Yuling, the Special Commissioner of the Third Administrative District and concurrently the Deputy Director of the Engineering Office, were away on official business in Jinghan. Without important personnel in charge, prompt action could not be taken. On the side of the Coordination and Repair Committee, County Magistrate Yu of Qianjiang, County Magistrate Zhou of Tianmen, and County Magistrate Gao of Hanchuan were stationed at sections one, two, and three, respectively, supervising the work. Only County Magistrate Xiong of Zhongxiang, County Magistrate Zhu of Jingmen, and Technician Chen Zhang of the Construction Department were stationed at the General Engineering Office. They urgently consulted with Chief Technician Feng, mainly to concentrate the laborers to complete the embankment section of less than forty-six meters and again requested the Engineering Office to prepare more materials and construction funds for use. They also notified the county magistrates stationed in each section to intensify supervision and speed up construction. Chief Engineer Lin Youlong and Deputy Engineer Liu of the Engineering Office went to Jiukou to excavate the lock mouth. The head of the Works Section was responsible for the rescue work at the fourth section. At 8:00 PM, the water level continued to rise. At the Xiongjiaqiao benchmark, reaching 44.6 meters, several breaches appeared in the cutoff dam. At 8:30 PM, it collapsed. The villages within the dam, spanning dozens of miles, were completely submerged. At 10:30 PM, it stretched to the foot of the fourth section embankment. At 11:00 PM, the telephone lines were cut, indicating that it had collapsed following the water interception dam. It was late at night, and the engineering personnel had no way to provide relief. Some of the soldiers stationed on the embankment also withdrew their defenses. Tens of thousands of laborers, sacrificing themselves for embankment repair, and unripe wheat unharvested, new seedlings unsown. Once they saw the embankment collapse, they fled in panic. Tools and clothing were discarded all over the embankment, and the sound of crying shook the earth, causing extraordinary chaos. Except for the county magistrates controlling and stopping a portion of the laborers from fleeing, most of them immediately scattered. The breach of the remote embankment occurred at the fifty-sixth sub-section of the fourth section. Initially, it breached three hundred meters, and by 1:00 AM on the 27th, it had expanded to six hundred meters. The fifty-fifth and fifty-seventh sub-sections were also affected. The rapid torrent poured down like a collapsing mountain. Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan counties were largely submerged. When the reporter inspected the breach, he saw a vast expanse of water inside and outside the embankment. Many refugees climbed onto roofs and trees, crying out for help, a scene too terrible to bear. There were more than ten worker sheds in the path of the breach. It is said that only the laborers from three sheds escaped, and the rest were swept into the flood, with dozens of deaths. Not only was labor wasted, but also lives were lost. However, the engineering personnel of Fenglu, before the breach, took their families and luggage and fled, so no one suffered. Although they were very slow in handling affairs, they were extraordinarily quick to escape.</p>
<p>After the Collapse of the Remote Embankment, Rushing to Repair Other Dangerous Embankment Sections</p>
<p>Shi Yuling, the Deputy Director of the Engineering Office, rushed to the work site on the morning of the 29th. Hearing that many refugees in Zhongxiang had not escaped and had been without food for two days, facing imminent death, he immediately ordered boats to be used for rescue and allocated rice for distribution. That evening, Provincial Government Committee Member Fan Xixu and Jianghan Engineering Bureau Director Xi Dejiong also arrived from Hankou. Fan and Shi met and wept in each other's arms. Shi and the five county magistrates telegraphed the provincial government, stating that they, as personnel involved, were inescapably responsible and requested severe punishment. The sorrow and indignation were overflowing from the words. The telegram read, "To Chairman Yang Jun of the Wuchang Provincial Government: The fourth section of the Zhongxiang Xiang Embankment Engineering Office's own project collapsed last night, as reported by the county magistrates. Now we respectfully present the details to you. The original height of the cutoff and water interception dams at Xiongjiaqiao was set at 45 meters. Previously, Director Liu (Shoupeng), Committee Member Fan (Xixu), and the undersigned, fearing that the set height would be difficult to withstand the summer floods in May, instructed the office to borrow sacks in advance to build a one-meter sub-dam. On the evening of that day, the water level at that location was 44.6 meters, as verifiable in the office's water level report. Yet the dam failed at that time. The fourth section originally had a drainage ditch, which Committee Member Fan ordered to be blocked up long ago. This time, Xiangyang had telegraphed many times in advance about the flood, but that ditch only began to be blocked up at 8:00 PM that night. Just as construction began, the water arrived, rushing straight down and causing severe flooding in the downstream counties. Most of the able-bodied men in the counties were on the embankment, and the ripe wheat could not be harvested. This year's autumn harvest will also be hopeless. This embankment project mobilized counties for half a year, using hundreds of thousands of laborers and spending millions of yuan. The tangible and intangible losses to the people are even more incalculable. On that evening, most of the office staff evaded responsibility, and were in a state of panic. It is difficult to describe. Although the undersigned did not construct the dams and the fourth section, we are all personnel involved and are indeed inescapably responsible. We should be severely punished to apologize to the people and uphold national law. In urgent telegrams, we are at a loss for words. Shi Yuling, Deng Bing, Zhou Yuwen, Xiong Daochen, Zhu Yiyuan, Gao Zhichao, bow and report."</p>
<p>Fan Xiji also telegraphed the National Economic Council and the provincial government, advocating for blocking the breach. The telegram read, "I, Ji, arrived in Shagang at 6:00 PM today. I learned that the breach in the fourth section is about 500 meters and has already stabilized, with no further expansion. I plan to go to the location tomorrow morning with the engineering personnel to survey the breach and the water interception dam. Although the time is pressing and farming is busy, the remote embankment is too important. It is insufficient to continue blocking and building to answer the government above and the people below. Looking at the water level of the Xiang River over the years, there is no absolute certainty of a large rise during the summer flood. It is only necessary to provide sufficient price, explain the advantages and disadvantages, and there will be no shortage of laborers willing to enlist. My humble opinion is to block the water interception dam and the breach in the fourth section simultaneously. If one of the two can be accomplished, it will be helpful to the entire embankment. If this year's water level is not high, we may be able to complete it by luck. I know that it involves taking risks and costs a lot, but for the future of the country and the lives and property of the people within the embankment, it seems we have no choice but to do so. If it fails, we can only follow it to our deaths to apologize to the government and the people. As for the details of the breach and the construction plan, I will discuss it with the engineering personnel after the survey and then report in detail. Fan Xiji bows and reports."

<h3 id="e66">The "Life and Death Society" in Xianyou, Fujian: An Illegal Civil Organization; Villagers Are Greatly Feared of It <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Fengting in the Second District of Xianyou County is known for its fierce folk customs and frequent illegal organizations. The Xinghua Black and White Flags originated here, and other groups such as the Ten-Sound Society, Yixing Society, and Three-Point Society are also very popular. Recently, the "Life and Death Society" has emerged in the Houlan Village area of Xinnan Township in the same district. The leader of the society is a Mr. Wang from Houlan Village, who calls himself the "General Manager." He directly controls over forty core members, who are called "Teachers." Each Teacher is in charge of a "Route" and can recruit an unlimited number of ordinary members. Each Teacher commands the ordinary members they recruited in their Route. The society's creed is "Loyalty, Courage, Righteousness, and Chivalry," and they have the oath, "We do not seek to be born on the same day of the same month, but we wish to die on the same day of the same month." Hence the name "Life and Death Society." The society worships Zhao Xuantan. To join, one must be introduced by two members and register with a Teacher. The Teacher sets a date to introduce the recruit to the General Manager, who then orders them to swear an oath before the Zhao Xuantan shrine, vowing to obey commands. During the oath, the new member is led by their Teacher and stands on the steps. Red candles are burned high in the hall, and two broadswords are hung crossed and inverted in the middle of the doorway. The new member ascends the steps, bows, and enters from under the swords. Standing on both sides, from the Xuan Tan down to the door with hanging swords, are the Teachers of each Route and important members, each holding weapons such as broadswords, spears, and handguns, pretending to strike the new member. The General Manager stands beside the incense table of the shrine. The new members, one by one, reach the altar, swear an oath before the deity, write their names, ages, and dates of birth on yellow paper, and burn it. The ashes are mixed with wine, and each person pricks their middle finger, sprinkles blood into the wine, and drinks a mouthful. The General Manager then, on behalf of all members of the society, bestows the society's secret code and symbol. Thus, they become a formal member. Upon joining, they must donate a certain amount to the fund based on their ability, at least two yuan. When members have conflicts with others, they resort to force. If money is needed, it is drawn from the fund. When the fund is exhausted, the Teachers of each Route are responsible for sharing the burden. Therefore, ordinary people fear the members of the Life and Death Society. Recently, He Aigu of Changba Village had a piece of land bordering a certain village in Houlan. A dispute arose, and He was almost beaten to death by members of the Life and Death Society. There have been many similar cases, all committed by the Life and Death Society. Therefore, people in the Fengting area of Xianyou are pale with fear. (June 4)</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Turmoil of Cigarette Unified Tax in Tianjin: The Hebei-Chahar Council Orders Local Payment; Chinese and Foreign Tobacco Merchants Unanimously Resist <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The cigarette merchants of Tianjin received an official letter from the Unified Tax Management Office of the Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Tianjin districts on the 2nd of this month, stating in brief: "All cigarette factories and companies in the provinces and cities of Hebei, Chahar, Pingjin, etc., regarding the matter of affixing stamps and paying taxes, should be allowed to directly handle it with the local Unified Tax Bureau. Since the Yizhong Company (i.e., the British American Tobacco Company) has a factory in Tianjin, it should be treated the same. Hereafter, all cigarettes sold and transported within the territory of Hebei, Chahar, Pingjin, whether imported or domestically produced, should be handled according to the following methods. The tax collection of the Yizhong Tobacco Company will temporarily be handled by the issuance of inspection certificates by this Council, stamped with a seal. All cigarette shipments from the company will be based on the affixing of inspection certificates and taxed according to grade. Cigarette shipments that have already been stamped and left the factory but have not been unpacked should be checked for certificates and supplementary taxes should be paid. Cigarette shipments imported from outside this territory should be stamped and supplementary taxes should be paid. Cigarette shipments transported to non-unified tax areas have always had a tax refund method, which will continue to be implemented." After this official letter was delivered to various tobacco firms and companies, all the tobacco merchants were greatly shocked. They believe that except for Yizhong and Zhenchang, which have factories manufacturing locally in Tianjin, the factories of other tobacco merchants are all located in Shanghai. The taxes have always been supervised and paid directly by the resident factory staff, and the stamps were affixed according to grade before they were allowed to be transported and sold. After arriving in Tianjin, the Tianjin Unified Tax Management Office only sent personnel to stamp a mark when the boxes were unpacked and sold, without collecting additional taxes. Now, in Hebei-Chahar territory, the inspection certificate procedure is implemented. Although the name is different, it is actually equivalent to double taxation. One item is taxed twice, which breaks the unified tax rule and increases the burden on tobacco merchants. This matter is close to extortion and is difficult to accept. On the morning of the 3rd, an emergency meeting was held at the Cigarette Merchants Association. Except for the Yizhong Company, which had other reasons and negotiated separately, a total of thirty-two companies, including Nanyang, Zhenzhong, Huamei, Huacheng, Yongyuan, Nanbeiyang, etc., attended. Wang Wendian, the chairman of the association, explained the orders of the Hebei-Chahar authorities and opened the discussion. Everyone agreed to oppose the double taxation in Hebei-Chahar territory. A telegram was sent to the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and the Unified Tax Bureau of the Four Provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan, requesting that the order be withdrawn to maintain the tobacco merchants' livelihood. A telegram was also sent to Mayor Xiao of Peiping, praying that he would mediate with the Political Affairs Committee and relay to the Unified Tax Bureau of the Four Provinces to allow the sale of existing goods as soon as possible to maintain the market. Representatives were elected to petition the Pingjin authorities. On the night of the 4th, representatives from the Unified Tax Bureau of the Four Provinces notified the tobacco merchants that the second resolution of the association, allowing the sale of existing goods to maintain the market, was acceptable. However, before the tax issue is resolved, a guarantor should be found. If taxes still need to be paid in the future, the tobacco merchants should pay taxes according to regulations, and the guarantor will be responsible for those who are dishonest. The tobacco merchants felt that this measure was too harsh and expressed their inability to comply. Wang Wendian called Xiao Zhenying's residence in Peiping at midnight, requesting that Xiao uphold justice. However, Xiao was not at home. On the 5th, the Hebei-Chahar authorities did not respond to the tobacco merchants' appeals. As for the telegrams sent by the tobacco merchants to the Ministry of Finance, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, etc., they generally stated, "The domestic industry is already extremely depressed. If taxes are levied again, not only will the merchants be unable to bear the burden, but foreign merchants will be given the opportunity to sell their products. Please withdraw the order or handle it separately. Those with manufacturing plants in Tianjin should pay taxes in Tianjin. Those without manufacturing plants in Tianjin but manufactured in Shanghai, Qingdao, etc., and already affixed stamps before being transported to Tianjin should be exempt from supplementary taxes." On the morning of the 5th, the tobacco merchants gathered again and resolved four items: First, request the Unified Tax Bureau to allow personnel to stamp all goods taxed before June 2nd and allow them to be unpacked and sold. Second, if there is no satisfactory result in the near future, the merchants will automatically unpack the goods for the sake of maintaining business, stamp them with the seal of the association, and report them to the Unified Tax Bureau of the Four Provinces for emergency needs. Third, when necessary, they will still petition to achieve the purpose of canceling double taxation. According to the Cigarette Merchants Association, the total number of cigarettes sold in Tianjin and re-exported is about 1,600 boxes per month (each box averages 50,000 cigarettes). Currently, there are only 600 boxes remaining in the city. If this issue is delayed and unresolved, Chinese cigarettes will not be transported north, and foreign cigarettes will likely seize the opportunity to replace the market. Therefore, the general cigarette merchants are very anxious. Furthermore, since this matter occurred, the prices of various cigarettes have increased since the 5th. Those originally sold for 3.2 yuan per box have increased to 3.8 yuan, and those originally sold for 3.8 yuan have increased to 4.6 yuan. There is some panic about shortages in the market. However, those familiar with the unified tax and the situation of tobacco merchants speculate that the tobacco merchants will inevitably fail and submit to the tax payment. The only remedy is to take it from the smokers and increase the prices of all cigarettes uniformly. The situation on the 5th already shows the beginning of this trend, and it will inevitably become the trend in the future. However, sales will be affected by the price increase, which is expected. The Unified Tax Bureau is currently using a blockade method. If tobacco merchants do not pay taxes, personnel will be stationed at the factory, and they will not be allowed to transport and sell. Since it is located in the concession, it seems there is no way. However, if the previous strategy is adopted outside the concession, the arrival of tobacco merchants' goods will gradually be cut off, and they will still fail.</p>
<p>As for the British Yizhong Company, its general factory is located in Shanghai, and there is a branch factory in the Third Special District of Tianjin, with more than 2,000 male and female workers. The unified tax has always been paid directly according to a contract with the Ministry of Finance, without going through any unified tax bureau for collection. The two factories in Shanghai and Tianjin pay a total of one million yuan per month. Because it is paid at the beginning of each month, the Ministry of Finance actually receives only 750,000 yuan as a reward, with 250,000 yuan as a rebate. Tax tickets are purchased for one million yuan, and the Tianjin factory obtains them from Shanghai for affixing. Since receiving the notice from the Unified Tax Bureau of the Four Provinces, Krisson, the manager of the Tianjin factory, immediately reported to the Shanghai headquarters and requested intervention from the Tianjin British Consulate. However, the Unified Tax Bureau limited the factory to paying taxes according to regulations within five days, otherwise, the goods would be prohibited from leaving the factory. On the afternoon of the 3rd, a large number of armed police were sent to surround the entire factory, demanding that the factory comply. Later, the British Consul went to mediate, praying that the Shanghai factory's telegram would arrive before replying. Currently, the factory has directly negotiated with the Ministry of Finance. The factory here is temporarily maintaining work. The British manager stated that if it is absolutely impossible, there is only bankruptcy and dismissing the workers. When that time comes, 2,000 unemployed men and women will increase social unrest. The authorities may ease their attitude and not insist that taxes must be paid locally. However, this observation may be wrong. The authorities' will is very firm, and they may not let go if it is not complied with. (5th)</p>

<h3 id="e69">Wuxi: The Price Problem Resolved <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Ji Kuan, the director of the Chief Committee of the Jiangsu Province Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee, came to Wuxi from Wujiang the day before yesterday to inspect the silkworm and silk testing ground. He also invited Li Baiping, the director in charge of preparations for the county's farmers' association, and County Magistrate Long, the director of the silkworm farming model district, Zhou Yuanquan, to the county government to discuss the issue of raising silkworm prices. Leading figures in the silk industry, Xue Shouhuan and Kuang Zukang, also went to meet the committee members one after another. After Mr. Zeng's earnest persuasion, he stated that the interests of the farmers should be taken into account. Mr. Xue also expressed his acceptance of the government's goodwill and his willingness to sacrifice. He agreed to appropriately increase the price of silkworms for this spring crop, increasing the standard price set by the Economic Commission by two yuan, with an opening price of thirty-two yuan. Silkworms of excellent quality will be further increased appropriately. Yesterday, the silk industry association sent letters to various silkworm purchasing manufacturers to inform them. According to Hua Shaochun, the executive director of the silkworm industry association, they will also find ways to increase the price of silkworms within the possible range. At the same time, the committee members invited various silkworm seed field owners from Suzhou and Wuxi, including Lu Zirong, Shao Shenpei, and Zhu Youfu, to the Wuxi Hotel to discuss the distribution of the number of autumn silkworm seeds to be transported to Zhejiang Province. As a result, Zhejiang Province needs 400,000 sheets of autumn silkworm seeds from other provinces this year, of which 75,000 sheets will be allocated by the Central Silkworm and Silk Testing Ground, and 325,000 sheets will be supplied by Jiangsu Province. Of this number, 200,000 sheets will be allocated to fields in Zhenjiang, 100,000 sheets to fields in Suzhou, and 25,000 sheets to fields in Wuxi. Yesterday (the 6th) at noon, the committee members left Wuxi for Shanghai to discuss important matters.</p>
<p>Also, the silk factory guild in this county recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Management Committee and issued the following regulations regarding the fees for semi-dried silkworms: 1. All semi-drying silkworm stores must register in advance and be approved by the district. 2. Silkworm purchasers who do not operate silk factories are not allowed to semi-dry. 3. Semi-dried silkworms must still be weighed, and the price will be converted to 70% of the price of fresh silkworms for fee payment. 4. If it is found that fully dried silkworms are being passed off as semi-dried silkworms, they will be confiscated. 5. The district will send personnel to inspect the circulation of semi-dried silkworm stores' joint tickets and code tickets. 6. Semi-dried silkworms must still pay fees to obtain a permit before they can be transported. The number of baskets and the net weight of semi-dried silkworms must be noted on the fee payment certificate for each shipment, and the permit number must be noted on the transport permit. After receiving the order, the guild sent letters to various silk factories yesterday to be followed. A total of 204 silkworm stores are registered in this county, with 2,690 single stoves. There are also 47 unqualified silkworm stores in various townships leased by cooperatives that have already been sealed, and 130 single stoves and 4 double stoves are registered with the model district. Yesterday (the 6th), all silkworm stores in the city and countryside opened to purchase silkworms. The price of silkworms in the city area was 32 yuan per dan, and the goods were not enthusiastic. In the Changda Mansion area of the rural area, improved silkworm seeds were baked and dried by cooperatives, totaling about sixty or seventy dan, so the fresh silkworms collected by various silkworm stores yesterday were all inferior goods, and the price was 33 yuan per dan. In the towns of Dongfangqian and Bashiqiao, the arrival of goods at the silkworm stores was also not enthusiastic, and the price was 35 yuan to 32 yuan per dan. There are a total of four silkworm stores in Dongting Town, and the arrival of goods was still enthusiastic, with the highest price seen at 34 yuan per dan. Silkworm stores in Guzhou, Yuqi, and Beiqifang have also opened for purchase, with the price at 35 yuan per dan, and the quality is very good. Silkworm stores in Jiangyin will open for purchase today (the 7th). Silkworm stores in Liyang began purchasing on the 4th, but they are all local silkworms, with a price of 21 yuan per dan.</p>

After the incident, the Public Security Bureau arrested the main criminals and sent them to the judiciary for several interrogations. It is now known that the case has been judged. Han Shifu and Xu Tangchun were sentenced to life imprisonment for jointly committing murder.</p>

<p>Kuang Zinan, a local resident and second-class pilot who had just returned from studying in Japan, was invited to a feast by relatives and friends on the second day of his return to Changshu. On the way home, he suddenly had a quarrel with a certain woman.

Knowing that this was unfavorable, the branch itself destroyed a portion of its belongings, claiming that he had destroyed public property. This case has caused public outrage and has been transferred to the judiciary for investigation. Because Kuang Zinan's brother was charged with destroying public property, he was released on bail for 1,000 yuan. This matter has been brought to the attention of the Aviation Alumni Association in Japan. Chen Dejian, Fang Wenxin, Weng Shanggong, Gao Wenxiao, Yang Qianren, Li Youmao, and Yang Beichao have jointly launched assistance, telegraphed to national aviation groups for support, and published an advertisement applying for justice to be upheld by people in this county.

It was impossible to cover everything in a few words. However, by observing the past, one could understand the future, and the following major events could guide future actions. The following matters, without international cooperation, would inevitably be sources of future wars. Briefly, these included economic competition arising from raw materials and markets, the expansionist desires of Italy and Japan, the brewing of political wars in South America, the actions of Balkan and Near Eastern countries as leaders, leading to the involvement of several European nations, the visible and hidden dangers of communism, the increase in German military preparations, and the collapse of international justice and morality.

<p>Foreign Minister's Speech: Foreign Minister Zhang then delivered a speech, stating, "The International Problems Research Association is holding its fourth annual meeting today. Distinguished Chinese and foreign guests and members of the Association are gathered together. I am honored to participate in this grand occasion. Your Association is composed of well-known figures from society, including university presidents, writers, and bankers. It is an academic organization dedicated to the study of international issues. Such organizations exist in various countries. For example, in Britain, there is the Royal Institute of International Affairs; in the United States, there is the Council on Foreign Relations; and in Japan, there are the Japan International Association led by Mr. Ishii and the Japan Foreign Affairs Association led by Mr. Yoshizawa. Other countries also have similar organizations, similar in nature to your association. It is a very prestigious academic group and can be said to be a tool for exercising people's diplomacy. In recent decades, transportation has become exceptionally advanced. The ancient dream of shrinking the earth, the so-called 'ten thousand miles as if in one's courtyard,' has been fully realized. As a result, international relations, whether in culture, politics, or economics, are becoming increasingly complex day by day. There is a state of mutual dependence among various ethnic groups in all aspects of life. For example, in the past, merchants could ignore international news and conduct their own business. However, the situation is different now. Fluctuations in international exchange rates immediately affect the cost of goods, so merchants must pay attention to international news. 'A single hair can move the whole body' is a perfect way to describe the complex international relations of today. Since international relations are becoming more complex day by day, our understanding of international affairs is becoming increasingly necessary. In recent years, the trend of researching international issues in our country has been developing. In academic circles, universities have added courses on international relations. In publishing, publications discussing diplomacy and international issues are also increasing. Even local newspapers, which often did not carry international news twenty years ago, are now paying attention to international news, whether political or economic. This is a good phenomenon, but to gain a full understanding of complex international issues and conduct comprehensive research, it is necessary to concentrate talent, organize groups, and use a division of labor and cooperation. Your association has emerged to meet this need. In the past four years, it has achieved remarkable results. We can believe that it will make even greater contributions to the country and society in the future. Regarding the methods of researching international issues, the members have rich experience, and I need not say more. However, in addition to studying international issues, your association also has the mission of people's diplomacy. To accomplish this mission, we must focus on mutual understanding among nations, because the relationship between countries is the same as the relationship between people. We know that humans are emotional animals, so people must connect emotionally to increase friendship. General social disputes arise in four stages: isolation leading to misunderstanding, misunderstanding leading to suspicion, and suspicion leading to conflict. International disputes are also the same. Therefore, if citizens of various countries can interact and communicate with each other, isolation will not arise. Once isolation is gone, all misunderstandings, suspicions, open and covert struggles can naturally be eliminated. Moreover, we humans also have a supreme common goal, which is international peace. Our country, for thousands of years, has been a country that emphasizes integrity and loves peace. Our national policy can be summarized in one sentence: seek self-preservation domestically and coexistence internationally. The key to coexistence is peace. To implement this policy, we must work together both officially and privately. Governments should respect each other's sovereignty and cooperate sincerely, and citizens should reciprocate and communicate with each other to remove isolation, explain misunderstandings, and eliminate suspicion, so as to establish a foundation for international peace. The members here have a deep understanding and thorough knowledge of current international affairs. Various countries also have similar organizations, so we can naturally communicate with each other, enhance friendship among citizens, and promote international cooperation. Today's harmonious atmosphere fully demonstrates your association's efforts and the sincere sympathy and enthusiastic support of the guests. Success in the future can be predicted. I would like to raise a glass and wish all members and guests good health." (The speech was translated into English by Secretary Duan Maolan.) Then, Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Wakasugi delivered speeches. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves, and the event ended at about 9:00 PM. Foreign Minister Zhang took the night express train to Beijing that evening.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Thirteen Fish Shops and the Fish Market Begin Cooperative Business: Special Facilitation for Market Entry Yesterday, Same Treatment Under All Market Regulations <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Fish Industry Association's members, Ganfeng and thirteen other fish shops, have resolved their entanglement with the Shanghai Fish Market through the advice of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Native Place Association. The cooperative agreement was finalized at a joint meeting of the Fish Market Board of Directors and the thirteen fish shops the night before last. They entered the market yesterday and began business immediately. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Cooperation Agreed: The Shanghai Fish Market Board of Directors and Ganfeng and thirteen other fresh fish shops held a joint meeting the night before last, chaired by Chairman Du Yuesheng. Both parties openly and honestly negotiated, and unanimously passed the resolution for Ganfeng and the thirteen other fish shops to join the fish market. The measures were as follows: 1. The thirteen fish shops would abide by the fish market's business regulations and all rules. 2. The fish market would treat the thirteen fish shops that joined later the same as those who joined earlier. 3. All thirteen fish shops would have fish market brokers, one for each shop, totaling thirteen.</p>
<p>Business This Morning: Ganfeng, Shengji, Gongda, Qiafeng, Xiangshun, Dacheng, Dechang, Hongyuan, Gongshun, Yuantong, Taichang, Yuanyu, Hongchang, and the other thirteen fresh fish shops, after agreeing to cooperate with the fish market, went to the fish market yesterday morning to arrange everything, obtain entry and exit permits, and complete various procedures. At the same time, the fish market specially facilitated the entry procedures for the thirteen fish shops. Most of them moved in last night and were allowed to start business in the fish market this morning. A few others were unable to complete the procedures in time, so they would enter the market today and could open for business tomorrow morning. As for the old site at the 16th Pier, it would cease operations.</p>
<p>Same Treatment: Previously, eight fish shops had joined the fish market. This time, thirteen fish shops joined the fish market. All are market brokers. However, the market regulations stipulate that there are only two wholesalers, one for river fish and one for fresh fish. Huang Zhensheng is in charge of foreign fish. Previously, the eight shops that joined earlier requested priority rights. After Chairman Du Yuesheng and Director Yu Qiaqing persuaded the eight shops, they withdrew their request. The cooperative agreement of the thirteen fish shops was not easy to reach. In the future, with joint cooperation, the business development of the fish market can be predicted to be bright.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry: The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai telegraphed Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry yesterday afternoon, stating, "To Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, Nanjing: Your esteemed telegram received. After repeated persuasion, all fish shops have agreed to cooperate and are allowed to join the market today. Respectfully reported, Yu Qiaqing and others of the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Misunderstandings Cleared: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Wang Xiaolai, General Manager of the Fish Market, yesterday. According to him, the fish market welcomed the joining and cooperation of the thirteen fish shops. After the open and honest negotiations at yesterday's (i.e., the day before yesterday) joint meeting, all previous misunderstandings had been completely cleared. The thirteen fish shops would cooperate and do business in accordance with the fish market's regulations. The fish market would treat the thirteen fish shops equally and decided to provide special facilitation, allowing them to enter the market for business before the joining procedures were completed. They had already moved in and were allowed to start business tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning). Currently, the fish market's business has increased to 50,000 yuan per day. It is predicted that during the fishing season in the next few days, it can increase to 70,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e79">Customs Authorities Publish Losses from Smuggled Goods: Smuggling Statistics for Tianjin for One Week at the End of May, Tax Evasion Exceeds One Million for Only Three Items <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Customs authorities released yesterday a statistical table of three smuggled goods transported from the "war zone" to Tianjin from May 25 to May 31, and a comparative table of the monthly amounts of the three smuggled goods from August of last year to May of this year. During the week from May 25 to May 31, the amount of smuggled goods transported to Tianjin, including artificial silk and cigarette paper, increased compared to the previous week, while white sugar decreased. Artificial silk from May 25 to May 31 was 2526 packages, and cigarette paper was 613 packages, while the previous week was 2122 packages and 173 packages, respectively. White sugar from May 25 to May 31 was 51957 packages, while the previous week was 67728 packages. The details are in the table below.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The Chamber of Commerce Cables to Request Inspection of Smuggled Artificial Silk: If Silk Fabrics Made from It Are Transported to Shanghai, Separate Audit Measures Should Be Established <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce requested the Ministry of Finance to establish separate audit measures for smuggled artificial silk used to make fabrics transported to Shanghai, cabling to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing as follows: "To the Esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the 5th of this month, we received a letter from the Silk Fabric Industry Association stating, 'We have received a letter from Sheng Daze stating that the problem of domestic smuggling is becoming increasingly serious. Although the Ministry of Finance has issued orders to investigate and prohibit it, the reasons are complex and difficult to implement, and no effective results have been achieved. Recently, we have found that a large amount of tax-evaded artificial silk fabrics from Zhoucun in Shandong and Gaoyang in Tianjin are transported to various provinces. From Zhoucun alone, up to 5,000 to 6,000 bolts are transported to Shanghai daily by express train, completely made of artificial silk and interlaced silk-cotton products, and artificial silk and genuine silk interlaced products, so that the taxed products of Shanghai silk merchants cannot be sold and business is plummeting. If we do not take immediate action to stop this, the number of unemployed workers will exceed tens of thousands, and the future consequences are unimaginable. We have heard that the Ministry of Finance has measures to transport goods based on the Yunjian system, but the measures are not thorough enough and there are concerns that more malpractices will arise. Our association believes that unless we rely on the simple transfer of raw material dispatch orders, we will not be able to stop smuggling. If we only rely on the certification of local commercial groups, the effect will be weak. We should request the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to be stationed permanently in the areas with the most rampant smuggling, to conduct strict inspections, and order them to conscientiously implement the methods suggested by our industry, in order to protect legitimate merchants and protect the national silk industry. We are sending this letter to request your attention and to forward it to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for consideration and handling.' We are now urgently informing you of this situation and respectfully request your esteemed chamber to consider it and approve its forwarding, as we deeply appreciate it. We have found that after the tax-evaded artificial silk mentioned by the association is unloaded in a certain place, it is made into silk fabrics or silk-cotton interlaced products. In an instant, it has changed from imported smuggled goods to re-exported domestic goods. All these opportunistic situations cannot be prevented by the current provisions of the Interim Regulations on the Inspection and Marketing of Imported Goods. The association's statement that, at the time of re-export, artificial silk tax bills should be used to exchange for silk fabric transport permits is indeed to supplement the omissions in the regulations and to prevent opportunistic behavior. Although one is applied to imported foreign goods and the other is applied to re-exported domestic goods, the scope seems to be slightly expanded. However, at this time when smuggling is rampant and fraud is rampant, the country has one more inspection method, that is, the tax revenue has one less worry about smuggling. This matter is automatically requested by the industry and there is no hindrance. We should truthfully transmit the situation to your esteemed department for consideration, and if you approve its adoption and implement it immediately, it will be a public convenience. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully pleads."</p>

The association's declaration and telegrams to the Capital's Judicial Yuan and the courts are recorded below:</p>

<p>Declaration</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued a declaration for the Second Unjust Imprisonment Compensation Movement Week, stating: The unjust imprisonment compensation movement originated five years ago at the Third Congress of the Republic of China Lawyers Association held in Hangzhou. At that time, the Congress passed a proposal on "Implementing a National Compensation Responsibility System for Government Errors in Judgment," which was submitted to the government but remained unanswered. In the twenty-second year, the Fifth Congress of the Association convened in Qingdao, and at the suggestion of this Association and the Wu County and Hang County Associations, it was proposed to the Legislative Yuan to formulate an unjust imprisonment compensation law. This was unanimously passed by the Congress, but the central government ignored it as before. When the Association held its Sixth Congress in Guangzhou, the cradle of the revolution, it was deemed necessary to expand publicity and begin a planned movement, passing a resolution to "Organize an Unjust Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee." Since then, the committee has held regular meetings in various local associations on a rotating basis, making continuous efforts and appealing to public opinion. Finally, the highest authorities of judicial administration expressed that they would not ignore the people's due compensation for unjust imprisonment due to judicial economic difficulties, hoping to eliminate unjust imprisonment through unjust imprisonment compensation. At the same time, the Legislative Yuan's Legislative Committee also expressed extreme support for the entire Association's proposal (the full text can be found in the Association's Law Journal, Volume 3, Issue 3). Thus, the unjust imprisonment compensation movement received spiritual assistance from all levels of the country. It was resolved that the Lawyers Association in all parts of the country would choose a day in the first ten days of June each year to hold the unjust imprisonment compensation movement, in order to make a unified appeal across the country, awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind, and seek the early realization of the national compensation system. This is the origin of the Unjust Imprisonment Compensation Movement Week. Since the first national movement week was held last year, the national judicial conference, which has attracted the attention of the whole country and is full of expectations, has been held. This Association has seized the opportunity and, daring not to belittle itself, also presented the proposal "The Unjust Imprisonment Compensation System Should Be Realized Urgently" to the conference through its attending representatives in conjunction with lawyers' representatives from all over the country. After merging with the "Realize Unjust Imprisonment Compensation" proposal submitted by Guangzhou University for discussion, the resolution "The original proposal shall be sent by the Judicial Yuan to the Legislative Yuan" was obtained. This movement has relied on the concerted efforts of relevant people in the national judicial community to form an important legislative issue. The future publicity movement should be changed to supervise the legislative aspect to complete its mission, and to be as bright as the constitution to be implemented, which is an inevitable step. However, there are many causes of unjust imprisonment, and it is not easy to redress unjust imprisonment. Those who harbor grievances and bear injustice must have a strong and unyielding will and follow strict and cumbersome procedures in order to clear the clouds and see the blue sky. Even if they are fortunate enough to obtain compensation after being wronged, it is still not enough to cover one-tenth of the actual damage suffered. Those who are not firm in their will, submit to the established situation, seek to avoid increasing actual damage, and are willing to endure humiliation, weeping and swallowing their voices, and end their lives in injustice, are even more numerous. Law is intended to eliminate evil, but if used improperly, it will produce evil. Is it the fault of the system or the fault of people? Its shortcomings cannot be satisfied by merely talking about post-event compensation. It is necessary to first reduce the so-called unjust imprisonment. On the one hand, local poverty alleviation groups should be consulted so that the weak who harbor grievances without complaint and bear injustice and are suspected can obtain appropriate guidance and fully exert their defensive functions. On the other hand, the government should be urged to implement the habeas corpus law as soon as possible to reduce the causes of unjust imprisonment. As for the unification and independence of judicial power, and not allowing division or any political pressure, it is related to the country's policy of securing the state and pacifying the people, and it is not only to prevent the occurrence of unjust imprisonment. Therefore, the future direction of continued movement should be to attach equal importance to both post-event relief, and to pay more attention to various procedures for pre-event assistance and post-event compensation, and strive to make them simple, so as to avoid the establishment of empty systems. All systems will inevitably encounter difficulties due to resistance at the beginning of their creation. Unjust imprisonment compensation is also the same. In the past few years, this Association has worked with the Association and local lawyers' associations to jointly promote this movement, and has been encouraged by the sympathy of people of all walks of life. Although it has obtained the passage of a proposal at the national judicial conference and laid its foundation, judging from the current situation, the division of legal power is still the same, and the financial difficulties are even greater. Some people may regard this as a non-urgent matter, and others may be limited by the environment and aware of the difficulties, and discourage their courage to make a bold decision. However, we believe that a sound country must first protect the people. The constitutional government is about to be implemented. If there is no unjust imprisonment compensation system to assist it, then the so-called protection of human rights is only a cosmetic civilization. If people cannot protect their right to survival, what is the point of pacifying the country and resisting foreign aggression? At the holding of this movement week, we should resolutely express the minimum requirements, and promptly promote the completion of the unjust imprisonment compensation law, so that it can be implemented on the same day as the Constitution, in order to improve the organization and survival of the country. We respectfully inform the people of the country, and hope that we can work together to achieve it.</p>
<p>Telegrams to the Two Yuans</p>
<p>Telegrams to the Judicial Yuan and the Legislative Yuan, Nanjing Judicial Yuan and Legislative Yuan: Regarding the unjust imprisonment compensation system, countries in the East and the West have either made it a code or a precedent, and it has been implemented without hindrance for a long time. However, our country still lacks it. Years ago, the Republic of China Lawyers Association, in order to seek the realization of the unjust imprisonment compensation system, jointly drafted an unjust imprisonment compensation plan with local lawyers' associations and submitted it to request the formulation of laws and regulations. At the beginning of the movement, public opinion was in agreement. Last autumn, it was again submitted to the National Judicial Conference, and it was also resolved to ask the Judicial Yuan to forward it to the Legislative Yuan to formulate an unjust imprisonment compensation system as soon as possible. Under the current situation of a weak country and a weak legal system, it is urgently necessary to implement it in order to maintain the rule of law. Therefore, we telegraphically request Your Yuans to forward it to the Legislative Yuan to promptly formulate unjust imprisonment compensation laws and regulations to protect human rights and improve the organization of the country. We are extremely urgent and awaiting orders. Shanghai Lawyers Association bows respectfully.</p>
<p>Record of Major Events</p>
<p>A record of major events in the unjust imprisonment compensation movement is recorded below: In June of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, at the Fifth Congress of the Lawyers Association, the Shanghai Lawyers Association proposed that the Legislative Yuan immediately promulgate the unjust imprisonment compensation law, which was passed and forwarded to the government. In September of the 23rd year, at the Sixth Congress of the Lawyers Association, the Guangzhou Lawyers Association and others proposed the organization of an unjust imprisonment compensation movement committee. In November of the 23rd year, the Standing Committee hired 49 unjust committees and established a Standing Committee. On May 5 of the 24th year, the first unjust imprisonment compensation committee was held in Suzhou. On June 5 of the same year, the first national unjust imprisonment compensation movement was held. On September 20 of the 24th year, the judicial conference passed the unjust imprisonment compensation bill and sent it to the Legislative Yuan for formulation. In October of the same year, the Legislative Yuan replied to the Association that it had been submitted to the Criminal Law Committee for reference. On November 15 of the same year, a petition was submitted to the Fifth Plenary Session of the National Congress. On February 17 of the 25th year, the third unjust imprisonment compensation meeting requested the Seventh Congress to continue to strive for it. On May 5 of the same year, Article 26 of the draft constitution had a clear provision for the national compensation system. On May 30 of the same year, the fourth unjust imprisonment compensation movement committee was held in Yangzhou. In addition, lawyers such as Yu Chengxiu, Ma Shouhua, and Cai Zhaohuang all wrote articles to expound the purpose of unjust imprisonment compensation.</p>
<p>An order was issued to the Hunan Provincial Department of Finance to abolish the production and sales tax case, and it is sincerely requested to review and order the immediate abolition of the tax. The telegram has been received and understood. In this case, according to the Chamber of Commerce's presentation of the same situation, it was stated that "the business tax is levied on the act. The member stores of the Chamber of Commerce re-manufacture and sell their goods, and it is not inappropriate to levy the business tax. As for the production and sales tax in Hunan Province, it was previously submitted to the court for an order to the Hunan Provincial Government to promptly stipulate measures for gradual abolition and report to the Ministry. The Chamber of Commerce's request to cancel the production and sales tax should be handled after the Hunan Provincial Government's report is received and reviewed." The Chamber of Commerce was notified on May 22 with Fu Zi No. 9547. Recently, the Hunan Provincial Government's consult was approved, stating that the production and sales tax levied in Hunan Province is now being gradually abolished in accordance with the court's order. It has been decided that starting from the 25th year, steps will be taken to abolish the tax, first exempting or reducing the tax rate on daily necessities for civilians. The above telegram is combined with the approval for your information. This approval.</p>
<p>President Mościcki of Poland</p>
<h3 id="e84">Polish President's Tenth Anniversary of Inauguration Celebrated by Polish Community in Shanghai, Polish Minister to Attend <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Mościcki, the President of Poland, is a world-renowned great scientist and is therefore known as the Scientific President. In June 1926, he was elected as President, and in 1933, when his term expired, he was re-elected with the most votes in the Parliament, because even the opposition party unanimously supported his scholarship and ability to handle affairs. Today is the tenth anniversary of Mr. Mościcki's inauguration as President, and the Polish government and people are celebrating and congratulating him. The Polish community in Shanghai will hold a celebration meeting at the YWCA at 999 Jing'an Temple Road at 9:00 AM today. The Polish Minister Wei Dengshou and the Chairman of the Overseas Chinese Federation will give speeches, and a Polish band will perform music to add to the fun. Mr. Mościcki is now 69 years old. He studied in Warsaw in his childhood and then entered the Riga Industrial School, where he excelled. After graduation, he devoted himself to revolutionary work, seeking to reclaim Poland's right to independence under the violent rule of Imperial Russia, and was eventually forced to flee overseas. He first went to London and worked as the director of a chemical laboratory, where he met the late Polish national hero General Piłsudski and became close friends. The success of the Polish independence movement was based on this. Later, Mr. Mościcki served as a professor at various universities in Europe and made many amazing inventions. Although Mr. Mościcki is now the head of state, he has never forgotten his scientific research work. In addition to his political work, he is still immersed in the laboratory, conducting tireless research. His expertise is in inorganic chemistry, electrochemistry, and electrical physics. On December 7 last year, the 30th anniversary of Mr. Mościcki's successful chemical invention was celebrated, and heads of state and scientific research institutions from various countries sent telegrams to congratulate him, which was extremely prosperous. Mr. Mościcki has made remarkable achievements during his tenure as President, which are too numerous to mention. The main ones include the proclamation of the new constitution, the signing of non-aggression treaties with Germany and the Soviet Union, the strengthening of armaments, the completion of railways, highways, and transportation networks, the stability of currency, and the development of industry and commerce, which have made Poland increasingly strong. He is especially commendable for his selfless personality, which has reconciled his political enemies and moved them to repent.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Huge Execution Case Involving Over One Million, Li Guojie Released on Bail Yesterday, Imprisoned for Three and a Half Years, Family Property Neglected, Li Zanhhou and Yu Qiaqing Responsible for Bail <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Li Guojie, the grandson of the late Qing Dynasty Minister Li Hongzhang and former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, when Chen Mingshu concurrently served as the Minister of Communications and Chen Fumu served as the Deputy Minister of Communications and concurrently the supervisor of the company, arbitrarily mortgaged four warehouses to the China Business Company and signed a contract with the Dalae Steamship Company that forfeited rights. Later, when Chen Mingqu and others failed, Zhu Jiahua, who was the Minister of Communications, discovered the illegal contract and found that 700,000 taels had been deducted as a commission when the contract was signed, which was said to have been taken by Chen Fumu. The contract was ordered to be canceled, so the 700,000 taels were unaccounted for. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications consulted the Ministry of Judicial Administration to send Li to the Shanghai District Court for trial. Because Li suffered from a chronic disease, the court, in order to restrict his residence, had Lawyer Jiang Yiping and Fuchang Ginseng Firm act as guarantors to send him to live in the first-class ward of Shanghai Hospital. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau Inspectorate sent police officers to investigate, and the court sent bailiffs to guard him. The prosecutor filed a public prosecution for breach of trust and embezzlement. The first instance sentenced Li Guojie to three years of imprisonment. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed. The First Criminal Court of the Jiangsu Higher Court came to Shanghai for trial and increased the sentence to three years and six months and ordered him to return 700,000 taels of damage to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, plus interest. Li appealed to the Supreme Court of the Third Instance, which recently ruled to revoke the original judgment and change the sentence to eight months of imprisonment for Li Guojie, with a two-year reprieve. The number of days of detention was also allowed to be offset, so the criminal case has ended. Li Guojie could have regained his freedom, but in the private prosecution part, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company re-engaged Lawyer Jiang Hechun to file a petition with the District Court for execution and recovery. Yesterday, Judge Xu Hongxi of the Execution Division opened a court to interrogate him. He was taken to Li Guojie at Shanghai Hospital. At 10:00 AM, Judge Xu opened the Fourth Court to interrogate him. After Jiang Hechun, the attorney for the plaintiff creditor China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, reported to the court, Jiang Yiping and Lu Shifang, the attorneys for the defendant debtor Li Guojie, also reported to the court. The judge ordered the debtor Li Guojie to be brought to court and asked, "The 700,000 taels that you embezzled, plus interest, has now become more than 1.2 million. All your property should be reported so that it can be executed." He replied, "I have been imprisoned for three and a half years, and I have not had time to take care of my family property, so I am very unfamiliar with it. Therefore, I request permission to be released on bail, and I will naturally sort it out." At this point, the defendant's attorney rose and requested that Li be handed over to a guarantor who can be summoned at any time. Now, the prominent official and businessman Li Zanhhou and Yu Qiaqing are acting as guarantors, hoping that the case can be resolved as soon as possible. At this point, the plaintiff's creditor attorney rose to object, claiming that the amount involved in this case was too large, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company authorities had a great responsibility, so they reported it to the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, before obtaining an order from the Ministry, he still requested that Li Guojie be detained. The defendant's attorney retorted that the criminal part of Li Guojie's case had ended, and that even if he was detained for a long time, it would not be of any benefit to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Moreover, after the debtor is released on bail and restores his social credibility, he can find ways to raise money, which is more than giving one more penny to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which is more national currency for the country, which is a win-win situation. The judge said that it was noon and he needed to investigate the identities of the guarantors and their corresponding responsibilities. He ordered the hearing to continue at 2:00 PM. In the afternoon, Judge Xu returned to the court and summoned the guarantors Li Zanhhou and Yu Qiaqing to the court. He explained that if they guaranteed Li Guojie's release, they must be responsible for summoning him at any time. If he could not be summoned, then the guarantors would be responsible for all the debts. The guarantors agreed and wrote and signed the bail bond, granting Li Guojie bail. It was 3:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e87">National Physicians' Association Requests Selection of Practical Medical Talents, Health and Medical Facilities Are Biased Towards Urban Areas, Medical Needs in Rural Areas Are Difficult to Meet <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The National Physicians' Association of this city, in view of the lack of practical physicians in the country and the fact that health and medical facilities are only biased towards commercial cities and cannot penetrate into the hinterland, so that the treatment of injuries and illnesses among the people is also deeply felt to be impossible to cope with, which is a major problem, and it is urgently necessary to conduct medical examinations to meet the needs. Yesterday, a special report was submitted to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Health, stating:</p>
<p>Petition for Medical Examination</p>
<p>of Practical Medical Knowledge</p>
<p>for the Benefit of Medical Administration</p>
<p>to Clearly State Views</p>
<p>and Humbly Request Consideration and Adoption</p>
<p>It is humbly submitted that in our country, with its vast territory and large population, new doctors in society are felt to be in short supply. In the past, in order to adapt to the national conditions and unify medical administration, the Ministry of Health, in addition to implementing the Physicians' Regulations, also formulated a flexible method for issuing certificates in August of the 21st year of the Republic of China, and issued general certificates, originally intending to</p>
<p>Relieve the Lack of Medical Talents</p>
<p>and Assist in Medical Administration. However, due to various factors such as time, region, and personnel, the results were neither universal, and the emergence of formal physicians, due to the small number of medical schools, was even more of a drop in the bucket. Therefore, public health and medical facilities, except for commercial cities, have not yet been extended to the interior. If this continues, it will not only greatly hinder the future of medicine, but also</p>
<p>the Treatment of Injuries and Illnesses Among the People</p>
<p>will be deeply felt to be impossible to cope with. Members of the Association are scattered throughout the country and have more real and accurate observations. This time, at the opening of the Fourth National Physicians' Representative Conference, there was a proposal to request Your Yuan (Ministry) to hold examinations for medical talents among those who have not been registered under the flexible certificate issuance method. The conference resolved to formulate the following examination methods:</p>
<p>Local Authorities of Various Provinces</p>
<p>together with academic organizations and professional organizations related to medicine, appoint experts to form specialized committees to investigate those new doctors across the country who have not graduated from formal medical schools, and issue licenses to practice medicine only after passing both basic medical science and clinical medicine. This practice</p>
<p>Examination Method</p>
<p>is held twice a year, in the spring and autumn, for both academic theory and clinical practice, as a supplement to the insufficient number of physicians. However, those who have graduated from correspondence schools in various places and have no practical experience are not included in this limit. When holding the examinations, the committee shall also join the provincial governments, education departments, provincial medical colleges, and provincial hospitals to form mobile medical teams,</p>
<p>go to various places</p>
<p>to be responsible for investigating and treating the unique responsibilities of each locality, and at the same time conduct on-site examinations for practitioners who have not obtained a license to practice medicine. Those who fail the examination will be given separate training in the location of each provincial government to supplement their knowledge. This method, although</p>
<p>is an Expedient Measure</p>
<p>can also be said to be a temporary remedy for the current situation of a lack of medical talent in the country. In accordance with the resolution of the Fourth National Congress of the Association, it is humbly submitted to Your Excellency for consideration and adoption. Whether it is appropriate or not, please decide, as it is for the public good. Sincerely submitted.</p>

<p>Mr. Ye, the manager of the Continental Company, was driving his own car to his brother's house at No. 13, Lane 414, Route Ghisi in the French Concession at about 12:00 last night when something happened. Just as the car arrived at the entrance of the lane, three thugs ambushed in the dark rushed into the car, intending to kidnap him. Fortunately, Mr. Ye was unusually alert and knew that the newcomers were definitely not good people. He immediately ordered the driver to turn the car around, stepped on the gas, and drove away to the west, thus escaping the disaster. When the car escaped, the thugs fired two shots, but fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, Mr. Ye reported the incident to the local French police station.

<h3 id="e89">National Goods Movement Exhibition: Scheduled Lantern Parade <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The National Goods Movement Exhibition of this city has been open for two weeks, and the sales of goods from various factories in the sales department have reached over 200,000 yuan. The number of visitors is increasing daily. In order to expand publicity, the association recently decided in a standing committee meeting to hold a National Goods Movement Lantern Parade on June 15th. All of the more than one hundred factories and businesses in the venue will participate. They have already applied to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for protection along the route during the event. Decorations and lanterns are being fully prepared. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Application for Protection Along the Route</p>
<p>The association has submitted a request to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting instructions to the various branches in Shanghai South to provide protection along the route during the event. The submission is for holding the National Goods Movement Lantern Parade. Since the various public groups and organizations in this city designated this year as the National Goods Year for citizens, the association was formally established and registered with the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Social Affairs. Its sole purpose is to promote national goods and publicize domestic products. It has successively held events such as the National Goods Sample Trademark Exhibition, the Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition, and the Shanghai South Temporary Market to promote the national goods industry. Although it has worked hard for half a year, the results have been limited. This is because social customs have always favored foreign goods, and every year, huge amounts of money flow overseas, draining the country's resources and causing economic panic. To reverse this declining trend, a large-scale national goods movement is needed to awaken the people from their infatuation with foreign goods and to save the country and ensure its survival. The association, witnessing this situation, fears that the country will perish soon. Therefore, it is holding the Shanghai National Goods Movement Exhibition to promote the advancement of the national goods movement. In order to expand publicity, it plans to lead all the national goods factories and businesses in the association to hold a National Goods Lantern Parade on June 15th, hoping that the slogan of "everyone uses national goods" will be known to every household, understood by women and children, and permanently imprinted in the minds of the people, so as to achieve the goal of defeating foreign goods and preventing the outflow of wealth. However, this matter is of great importance. In addition to separately organizing a preparatory committee for the lantern parade to handle preparations, it has also prepared a document with a route map of the lantern parade, requesting your bureau to approve it and instruct the various branches in Shanghai South to provide the convenience of protection along the route at the time to ensure safety. This is deeply appreciated. Respectfully submitted to Cai, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, by the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Year National Goods Movement Association.</p>
<p>Procedures for Participating in the Parade</p>
<p>Procedures for National Goods Factories to Participate in the National Goods Movement Lantern Parade:</p>
<p>*   All factories and businesses participating in the National Goods Lantern Parade must be manufacturers or sellers of national goods.</p>

<p>The theft of twenty confiscated pistols and a wireless radio from the evidence vault of the Shanghai Local Court on the night of the 9th of last month caused a sensation in society. The court prepared documents consulting with various agencies for assistance. The Public Concession Police ordered all detectives to pay attention.

Suddenly, a person named Wang Xiao'a Yu was found trading pistols with Detective Liu's informant at a teahouse on Kunming Road, stating a price of seventy yuan for two pistols and thirty bullets. Upon the exchange of goods and money, the two pistols were brought, and Wang Xiao'a Yu was immediately arrested. Upon checking the serial numbers, it was confirmed that the pistols were the ones stolen from the Local Court.

<h3 id="e92">Over Forty Trade Unions in This City Established a Restoration Organization Movement Yesterday; Established a Smuggling Reporting Committee; Sent Telegrams to Trade Unions Nationwide to Jointly Report Smuggling <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News reports that trade unions in this city held a joint meeting last night to organize trade union organizations and assist the government in reporting smuggling. A Restoration of Trade Union Organizations and Smuggling Reporting Committee was established on the spot and will begin work immediately. A declaration has been issued. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Meeting</p>
<p>At 6 PM yesterday, a joint meeting of trade unions was held at No. 54 Ermalu, Shanghai Industrial Society. Representatives from over forty trades, including the Southern Goods Industry, Chinese and Foreign Textile Industry, Calligraphy and Fan Industry, Pharmaceutical Industry, Tea Industry, Canned Food Industry, Sauce Industry, Customs Brokerage Industry, Rice Industry, Porcelain Industry, Paper Industry, Silk Industry, Cosmetics Industry, Grocery Industry, Ham Industry, Silk Dyeing Industry, and Silk Industry, including Jiao Chunsheng, Zhao Zhenhua, Yu Yaoqiu, and over fifty others, attended.</p>
<p>Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>Yu Yaoqiu was elected as chairman. After formalities, the chairman reported on the situation of smuggling in North China, and the trade unions should assist the government in strictly reporting it. Then, discussions began.</p>
<p>*   Regarding the determination of the organization's name, it was resolved to be named the Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions Restoration Organization Movement Committee.</p>
<p>*   Regarding the drafting of the organizational regulations, it was resolved that Lu Muqin would draft them.</p>
<p>*   Regarding the proposal to formulate measures for trade unions in various industries to report smuggling and request approval, it was resolved to amend and pass it.</p>
<p>*   Regarding the proposal that the committee should issue a declaration and telegram to trade unions nationwide to jointly restore trade union organizations and effectively report smuggling, it was resolved to hand it over to the Secretariat for drafting.</p>
<p>Establishment of Two Committees</p>
<p>Two committees were immediately organized:</p>
<p>*   The Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions Restoration Organization Movement Committee.</p>
<p>*   The Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions Smuggling Reporting Committee. Cai Xiaohe, Jiao Chunsheng, Yuan Zhaoxin, Zhao Zhenhui, Lu Muqin, Yu Yaoqiu, and Shen Jiabin were elected as members to be responsible for handling the affairs of the two committees. Yang Jinlong was hired as secretary.</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Ever since the enactment of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations, it has been generally believed by the central legislative bodies and various ministries that the legal status of trade unions nationwide would not suffer any damage due to the transfer of the law. In fact, the fate of trade unions nationwide has long been in danger with the legal system. Looking at the current industrial and commercial associations, the employee members, who are hired by others, are rarely represented. Even if there are hundreds of millions of people, they are not allowed to participate. The past misfortunes have not been recognized by the central authorities. Although, I have heard that the organization of a nation is the measure of a country, and governing a state is governing its people. Labor-capital conflict is minor. The country is in imminent danger, and anyone who has ambition should take action to solve the problems. This is why Legislator Ma Yinchu proposed to overthrow the business organization and amend the law. The members of this committee, with years of worry, dare to exert our utmost effort to organize the Shanghai Municipal Trade Unions Restoration Organization Movement Committee and to organize a Smuggling Reporting Committee, formulating guidelines to assist the government. Since the purpose is pure and the measures are peaceful, it is hoped that all sectors of society will provide assistance, that the capitalists of each industry will remove misunderstandings, and that the trade unions nationwide will rise up to carry out this movement to save the country, to reverse the crisis, and to maintain the country. We solemnly declare this.</p>

<h3 id="e95">The Municipal Federation Opposes Japan Increasing Troops in North China; Telegrams Compatriots; Unite to Support the Government; and Telegraphs the Central Government to Protest Seriously <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city, considering that Japan is increasing troops in North China under the pretext of protecting its citizens, infringing upon our country's sovereignty, disrupting peace, and having a very significant impact, telegraphed the whole country yesterday and requested the central government to insist on resistance. The original telegram is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Whole Country</p>
<p>Please, all newspaper offices, forward to all compatriots for public scrutiny. This time, Japan is unreasonably increasing troops in North China, adopting wartime establishment, occupying key positions, controlling transportation, destroying our country's sovereignty, and endangering peace in the Far East. Its arrogance is outrageous and infuriating. According to Japan's strong arguments, the pretexts for increasing troops are nothing more than protecting overseas citizens and following treaties. In fact, according to international practice, overseas citizens are naturally protected by the government of the country where they reside according to the law. If it is said that troops must be dispatched wherever overseas citizens travel, then how can such a phenomenon be tolerated in the international community? Take Japan, such as major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka, where many overseas citizens from other countries reside. Would other countries send troops to protect them, or even wield weapons like they are facing a formidable enemy? Would Japan not find this strange? If it is still claimed that public security in North China is precarious, then the bandits who invaded Shanxi have been defeated, and it is the instigation of who is causing anxiety today? Japan cannot deny its responsibility. Therefore, if Japan cannot reflect on itself and be aware of the wrongdoings, then the unreasonable increase of troops will only provoke emotions and threaten public security. Before it changes course, the future will be unbearable. As for invoking the Boxer Protocol to mask its aggressive troop increase, it is not worth refuting. The Boxer Protocol was signed more than thirty years ago. Over time, situations have changed, and it has long lost its effectiveness. Even stepping back, Sections 7 and 9 of the Protocol only allow a small number of troops to be stationed in Peiping and along the Peiping-Yulin railway to ensure the safety of the embassies. There are no words about deploying heavy troops to protect overseas citizens. Now Japan is increasing troops according to its original plan, which will soon be completed, and the Japanese and puppet troops along the Great Wall are also advancing south, taking a massive encirclement formation, and their actions are active. The purpose is obvious. Compatriots, since the September 18th Incident, the defenses of the Northeast have been completely removed, and now they are pressing closer, encroaching on our heartland. If we do not rise up and pursue them, the country will be fragmented, and sovereignty will be lost. This association has observed the difficult times and is extremely frightened. In addition to telegraphing the Central Government for serious negotiations, we respectfully ask all compatriots to rise up and support the government to protect the integrity of our territory and maintain national sovereignty. (Abbreviated below)</p>
<p>Request for Negotiations by Telegram</p>
<p>National Government of Nanjing, Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Military Affairs Commission, Japan is increasing troops in North China under various pretexts, infringing upon our sovereignty and threatening peace. It is outrageous and infuriating. Since the September 18th Incident, the defenses of the Northeast have been completely removed. Now they are oppressing our territory with strong troops and entering our heartland. If we do not take action, it will be difficult to survive. Therefore, we earnestly request serious negotiations to maintain national rights. We respectfully request you to examine and implement this. Sincerely, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Inland River Navigation Association of this city received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In reply, on the 3rd of this month, we received the Executive Yuan Secretary-General's document No. 4056 dated June 2nd, quoting the President's instruction: 'Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's submission on behalf of the Inland River Steamship Association that the collection of tonnage dues for tugboats and cargo ships in this city violates the law, listing various points, and requesting review and order to abolish it, the Ministry of Finance was instructed to review and reply. Regarding the claim in the original submission that Shanghai tugboats have licenses from the Ministry of Communications and have paid ship dues, and should not be charged dues again, the Ministry has revised the last paragraph of Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Ship Dues Regulations, specifically stipulating that ships holding nationality certificates or registered licenses issued by the Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications are exempt from inspection and may receive reduced fees. As these tugboats have been registered and licensed by the Ministry of Communications and have paid registration, license, and measurement fees, they can be charged reduced fees in accordance with the above regulations. The Ministry has also consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government on the method of charging reduced fees for tugboats to alleviate the difficulties of navigation, etc.' The matter has been communicated to the original submitters for their information, etc.' We hereby inform you for your information." We checked that this case was submitted by your association, and we separately submitted it to the central government, and we further submitted the situation. We previously received a reply from the Central Political Conference, informing us that each case has been filed. Now, we respectfully request you to check and act accordingly."</p>

<h3 id="e107">Relief Society Investigator: Discover Two Abducted Women; Crime of Abduction Solved on Guangzhou Ship; Li Aizhen and Chen Aizhen Rescued <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the China Relief Society for Women and Children, along with customs marine police detectives Qu Hequi, Zhou Zenghua, and Xu Juelu, went to the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession to inspect the Guangzhou-bound ship about to set sail. In the steerage, they encountered three young women accompanied by a man wearing a blue cloth jacket and pants. The detectives noticed that while two of the women had permed hair and wore fashionable shoes and clothes, their arms were bare and their skin was very rough and dark, unlike people accustomed to living in the city. Suspicious, they began to question them. The four people spoke different dialects, revealing inconsistencies. They were taken to the marine police station. The man, named Chen Shunhai, 42 years old, from Lanxi, confessed to conspiring with his accomplice, Chen Haigen (still at large), to abduct the two fashionably dressed women and take them to Guangdong to open a brothel. Another woman arrested, named Pang Ereyuan, was Xu's concubine and was also accompanying them to Guangdong to avoid suspicion. According to Pang Ereyuan, 23 years old, from Changshu, her husband had passed away. Last year, she came to Shanghai from Xiju and was introduced to Xu Haigen by the defendant Chen Shunhai. They became lovers and lived at 304 Fumin Road in Nanshi. Chen brought the two abducted women there. When the incident occurred on the ship, Xu fled first. When questioned, one of the abducted women, Li Aizhen (also known as Su Feng), 19 years old, from Huzhou, said that two years ago, Chen Shunhai introduced her to Wang Aibin, a fellow villager, with whom she had been lovers for five or six months before breaking up. A month ago, Chen suddenly came to Huzhou, claiming that Wang had opened a ham shop in Guangdong and asked her to go to Guangdong to reunite with Wang. She believed him and came to Shanghai, staying at Xu Genhai's house, unaware that she was being deceived. The other abducted woman, Chen Aizhen (also known as Haizhen), 20 years old, from Zhenjiang, lived at 360 Fumin Road in Nanshi with her lover, Zhang Wen. She was lured by Xu Haigen and Pang Ereyuan, who said they would go to Guangdong for sightseeing, unaware that she was being forced into prostitution. The police officer stated that Chen's crime was premeditated and that the innocent women were almost thrown into a pit of fire, which was extremely hateful. He ordered that Xu be apprehended for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Eight-Yuan Debt Leads to Murder: Body Examined Yesterday; Determined Cause of Death was Gunshot Wound; Ji Laoer Provides Information About Chen Xiangrong <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Ji Laoer (also known as Amao, nicknamed Xiaochongming), from Nantong, residing at 24 Lanxin Lane, Boer Road, French Concession, borrowed eight yuan from Wu Caoshi, the wife of Suzhou resident Wu Agen, who lent money at high interest rates at 8 Rundenan Lane, Huanghe Road, in April of last year. At the time, Ji gave his gold ring to Wu as collateral for the eight yuan. Later, Ji was unable to repay the principal, so he converted the debt into a small interest loan, paying back 480 cash coins daily. Subsequently, Wu Agen and Wu Caoshi invited Ji to settle the interest at 54 Yihe Tea House, Huanghe Road, on the afternoon of the 4th, leading to a verbal dispute. The two parties agreed to meet at the same tea house the following afternoon to discuss the matter. When both sides arrived, the police were notified and dispatched detective Sun Qiwan to arrest them at the Yihe Tea House. He fired a warning shot, which struck Ji Shilin in the back, piercing his chest. Ji fled to the front of 8 Jialu Road, where he collapsed and died. After receiving the report, the police dispatched another detective to the scene and took Ji Laoer into custody to await the examination of the body. As reported yesterday, the police reported the matter to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren, forensic doctor Jiang, and secretary Peng arrived at noon to conduct the examination. Only the deceased's uncle, Ji Tinghua, arrived to claim the body for burial. The defendant, Ji Laoer, and the plaintiffs, Wu Agen and Wu Caoshi, and witness Chen Xiangrong were waiting in court for questioning and were not present. It was determined that Ji Shilin's death was caused by a gunshot wound, and Ji Tinghua took the body for burial. Subsequently, the police sent Ji Laoer to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police department, stated the case, claiming that the defendant attempted fraud and used an ax to injure a detective. The police department requested a seven-day extension for further investigation. Detective Xue Youlin then reported on the investigation and presented the murder weapon (an ax). Wu Agen, Wu Caoshi, and Chen Xiangrong testified that the defendant attempted fraud, injured a detective with the ax, and that the defendant's brother resisted the detective. The detective fired a warning shot, resulting in Chen Xiangrong's mistaken ax strike that killed Ji Shilin. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu reviewed the testimony and decided to postpone the trial until the 13th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Song Dynasty Tripitaka, carved at Zhaisha and reprinted by the local Scripture Repository, has long been published. Its catalog, due to various connections within the entire collection, has only recently been published. The content is complete. Key points include: (1) Discrepancies in the Catalog: The catalog of Zhaisha in the Japanese Showa Buddhist Treasure contains many discrepancies and omissions compared to the actual scriptures currently found by the repository. Therefore, a new catalog has been compiled based on the actual scriptures, with the old Showa catalog attached for comparison. (2) Excellence of Various Monographs: Ye Gongchao's Small Chronicle of Yansheng Temple focuses on the history of the Zhaisha carvings, examining and annotating dozens of ancient books to form a system. Jiang Weiqiao's Record of the Beginning and End of the Ning Tripitaka Reprint describes the fundraising and operational situation, the difficulties encountered, and the care taken. (3) Treasures of the Prefaces: Traditionally, prefaces to scripture carvings focus on theoretical elaborations, but Zhu Qinglan's preface provides detailed historical accounts, and Wu Jiya's preface sincerely narrates the promotion. Both can be read as summaries. In addition, examples and page-filling tables are also related to textual research on the entire collection. With the publication of this record, the quality and value of the Zhaisha Tripitaka can be better represented. The repository has already sold out its existing collection. In order to meet the continued purchase requests from afar, it has negotiated with existing customers to relinquish ten copies, which will continue to be offered at the pre-agreed price of 525 yuan per copy as a preferential circulation (still at 712 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai) for one month, after which it will be closed. It is said that the total cost of completing this project was over twenty thousand yuan, which was covered by Zhu and Ye.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Cattle and Sheep Prices Suddenly Rise: Public Association to Convene Meeting to Discuss <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Cattle and sheep prices in this city have risen by 20% due to the suspension of livestock shipments from Anhui and Liaoning provinces. As most of the cattle and sheep in the city are supplied by Liaoning, and Anhui province has suffered from drought and flood years, there is a shortage of draft cattle. Therefore, a notice has been issued to all counties to suspend exports in order to facilitate cultivation. As a result, cattle from Bengbu have been stopped from coming to Shanghai. The Liaoning-Ning area also banned the export of cattle and sheep at the beginning of the month. As a result, goods are scarce, and the market is feeling the strain of supply not meeting demand. It is estimated that the city's daily sales of cattle and sheep are about 6,000 heads, and these two provinces usually supply about 2,000 to 3,000 heads. Since the ban on shipments to Shanghai, although other provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangsu still have shipments to Shanghai, the shipments are rare, so the black market prices have risen by 20%. The Cattle and Sheep Industry Association plans to convene a meeting in the coming days to discuss the matter.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having recently read the local news section of your esteemed newspaper, which contained a news item stating: "The treatment of thirteen fish dealers after entering the fish market was not resolved yesterday." There are inconsistencies regarding the service fee, with the market collecting one-quarter of the proceeds. The actual service fee is 2%, and other rights are the same as those of the eight existing businesses. This equal treatment was decided by the board of directors of the market yesterday and announced to the managers of the thirteen businesses. It is believed that your newspaper's report on this matter was due to a misunderstanding of the rumors. We are writing to request that you correct it.</p>

<h3 id="e133">President Chiang Instructs the Ministry of Education to Intensify Training of Primary and Secondary School Teachers. Summer Courses to Be Established in Various Provinces and Cities This Year. Designated Schools to Conduct Training for Teachers of Various Subjects. <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th) President Chiang recently instructed the Ministry of Education regarding the professional development of primary and secondary school teachers, emphasizing that improving the teaching staff should be considered a primary task of educational administration going forward. After detailed planning, the Ministry of Education has determined standards and will implement fundamental methods to address the issue. This involves strictly urging secondary schools and above to intensify mental, disciplinary, and other fundamental training in accordance with the prescribed special education plans, in order to cultivate talent. Remedial measures involve providing supplementary training to current teachers, giving them opportunities for further education and remedial learning. These training sessions can be organized directly by the central government, or, due to the large number of trainees, they can be organized separately by provinces and cities, utilizing the scientific facilities and personnel of excellent local universities. It is reported that the Ministry of Education has decided on the following implementation measures: (1) Order all provinces and cities, starting this year, to take advantage of secondary school summer vacations to organize primary school teacher training sessions by district, or to entrust normal schools to handle them, or to assign the local responsible educational administrative organs to organize them, so that all primary school teachers under their jurisdiction will have the opportunity to participate in at least one training session within the next three years. (2) Order the education departments and bureaus of each province and city to jointly establish teacher training courses for secondary schools with excellent local universities designated by the Ministry of Education, divided into subjects such as mathematics, science, history, geography, and English. The departments and bureaus of each province and city will formulate a plan for the rotation of teachers of various subjects in secondary schools throughout the province and city, so that all teachers of various subjects in secondary schools will have the opportunity to participate in at least one training session within three years. The designated universities are: National Central, Peking, Tsinghua, Peking Normal, Wuhan, Sun Yat-sen, Zhejiang, Jiaotong, Shandong, and Sichuan (national universities); Guangxi and Hunan (provincial universities); and Jinling, Huazhong, Datong, Hujiang, and Xiamen (private universities). (3) The Ministry of Education will jointly prepare the summer training sessions for teachers of agricultural vocational schools with the Central Agricultural College, divided into agronomy (crop and sericulture groups). Domestic agricultural experts will be lecturers. Each public and private agricultural vocational school in each province and city will select one to two full-time teachers to participate in the training, to improve their knowledge and skills in agricultural teaching. The training period will be five weeks, and the training location will be the Central Congress. (4) The Ministry of Education will entrust the Shanghai Private Lei Shi De Industrial Vocational School to organize the summer training sessions for teachers of industrial vocational schools, divided into three classes: mechanical, civil engineering, and applied chemistry. Each public and private industrial vocational school in each province and city will select one to two people to participate in the training, to improve their knowledge and skills in industrial teaching. The training time will be fifteen days. The above four items have all been implemented by the Ministry of Education. In addition, measures for short-term primary school teacher training and training of public education cadres are also being drafted for gradual implementation.</p>

<p>Chairman's Speech. Liu Zhun-en, Chairman of the Presidium, stated in his speech that this year's Teachers' Day is different from previous years. During this period of national crisis, how to implement national crisis education and promote national salvation is the current priority. First, there should be a spirit of struggle. Teachers themselves must work harder. Second, there should be a spirit of unity. Teachers should unite to carry out the national salvation movement. Third, there should be a spirit of sacrifice, preparing to sacrifice for the country and the nation. I hope that our teachers will fight to the end. Next, Jiang Jianbai reported on the preparation process, explaining the points of this year's Teachers' Day and the responsibilities of teachers.</p>
<p>Director's Instructions. Following Mayor Wu's speech, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau was invited to give instructions, stating that Teachers' Day is not only for celebration, but also for happiness, especially in times of national crisis. Teachers in general should be more excited, self-respecting, and confident. Our only leader, Chairman Chiang, has mentioned education in his speeches and writings these past few years, and has always regarded education as the most important thing. Therefore, we always believe that only education can save the country. We should respect ourselves, respect ourselves, and work tirelessly. If the hundreds of thousands of teachers in the country all have this concept of self-respect and self-respect to motivate all initiative, then the country's revival will surely achieve excellent results. Secondly, we should follow this ten-year summary of life, ten-year lessons, and the famous dictum that "what Heaven imparts is called nature; to follow one's nature is called the Way; to cultivate the Way is called education" as the standard for our teachers' self-cultivation. Next, Chen Gong delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Proposals Passed. Next, the proposals were passed: (1) Petitioning the Ministry of Education to issue an order stipulating June 6 as Teachers' Day, in order to celebrate it, (2) Petitioning the Ministry of Education to order bookstores to reduce the prices of textbooks to reduce the burden and facilitate popularization, and (3) Organizing a joint office of the United Association of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools in this city, with Chen Jicheng, Jiang Jianbai, Feng Yixian, Sun Yucai and others exchanging opinions before making a decision.

<p>The track and field preliminary selection for our country's participation in the World Games, in addition to the training camp previously opened in Beiping, will be held this afternoon at 2:00 PM in Shenyuan. In addition to the 20 athletes from the training camp, 36 men and 9 women have registered to participate. To increase the interest in competition, Shanghai's foreign athletes have been invited to hold a competition. Many Chinese people participate in the 100, 200, and 400-meter events, but there are also some whose results are unknown. Therefore, a test was conducted in Shenyuan yesterday afternoon, and as a result, Fu Jincheng, Cheng Jinguan in the 100-meter, Cheng Jinguan in the 200-meter, and Li Yanxiang in the 400-meter were selected and allowed to attend today's Sino-Western competition. Both the Chinese and Western teams are composed of the most outstanding members. Furthermore, given the new and active atmosphere and excellent results of the Chinese track and field community over the past two months, this is to be expected.</p>
<p>This competition is specifically for selecting our country's representatives to the World Games, so the competition with the Western Alliance is purely for friendly exchange. Therefore, scores will not be counted, and no championships will be awarded. Order in the venue will be maintained by the U.S. Marine Corps and the Boy Scouts of St. John's University, and the Mains Military Band will be present to play music to add to the interest. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and half a yuan. News reporters can enter designated seats with badges. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>Our participation in the World Games track and field preliminary selection, scheduled to be held at Shenyuan this afternoon at 2:00 PM for the Sino-Western competition, was preceded by trials at Shenyuan yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM due to the large number of participants in the sprint events and the lack of accurate results. As a result, Fu Jincheng and Cheng Jinguan were selected for the 100 meters, Cheng Jinguan for the 200 meters, and Li Yanxiang for the 400 meters. All details are as follows:</p>
<p>100 Meters: The participants in the 100-meter trials included Fu Jincheng, Cheng Jinguan, Zhang Xikui, Ye Songping, Chen Yongfu, and Yan Zhaoshen. After the lanes were drawn, everyone except Cheng Jinguan false-started three times. Because it was a trial, it was still allowed to continue. After the start, Fu Jincheng took the lead, followed by Cheng Jinguan, and the rest were behind. At 80 meters, Zhang Xikui accelerated, almost equaling Cheng Jinguan, but fortunately, Cheng had a strong sprint and maintained second place. Fu Jincheng crossed the line first, with a distance of about three feet, and a time of eleven seconds.</p>
<p>400 Meters: Only Li Yanxiang, Zhu Aixian, and Chen Mingliang participated in the 400 meters. After the start, everyone was very close, with almost no distinction between them. At about 130 meters from the finish line, Zhu Aixian accelerated, pushing forward desperately, but it was a flash in the pan and soon became weak again. Li Yanxiang, on the other hand, ran tighter and tighter, reaching the finish line first with a time of 53.6 seconds, followed by Zhu with a time of 54.1 seconds, and Chen Mingliang in third, with poor posture and running very hard.</p>
<p>200 Meters: The participants in the 200-meter trials included Cheng Jinguan, Ye Songping, and Yan Zhaoshen. Cheng started very quickly and took the lead throughout, with an increasingly powerful sprint to the end. The others were far behind. Cheng reached the finish line first with a time of 23 seconds, leading by about three meters. Ye Songping and Yan Zhaoshen finished second and third, with a difference of one meter between them.</p>
<p>100 Meters: (1) Fu Jincheng, (2) Cheng Jinguan, (3) Zhang Xikui, 11 seconds.</p>
<p>200 Meters: (1) Cheng Jinguan, (2) Ye Songping, (3) Yan Zhaoshen, 23 seconds.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was unchanged. During the first half of the day, Chinese merchants and Xinfeng were still buying, and banks were aggressively selling. Early in the morning, the foreign exchange market reported that London's major contracts, both near and far, were flat. Floor traders said that there were a few transactions after the close according to the exchange rates, but the final price was still weak, because there were sellers offering prices lower than 0.0625.

Compared with the previous close, England and America were both flat. After the opening, although Chinese merchants were buying, the situation stabilized because of the banks' sales. HSBC Bank announced its exchange rates, with England and America both flat, and the silver equalization tax was unchanged. At this time, the process hovered, and Xinfeng Foreign Firm was still settling in shillings, while China was selling, so there were no special changes at noon. At the noon closing, the recent selling price was one shilling one penny three seven five for the British exchange rate and 29 yuan three seven five for the U.S. exchange rate. Compared with the previous close, the British was flat and the US dollar was slightly tighter by 0.0625. The forward exchange rate was also the same.

<h3 id="e156">Securities: Public Bond Market Remains Sluggish, Major Players Increase Selling <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw little market activity. Major players increased selling, with buyers only covering short positions and not initiating new ones. Some major players bought long positions, and while some holdings of the "47th series" were recovered, this was not for long positions. Despite official denials, fluctuations in the Hong Kong exchange rate were even more intense than before, but the reasons were not explained, further undermining market confidence. Even if there is a recovery, caution should be exercised against major players taking profits on their long positions. Yesterday, trading began with "54th series" buying, but other players sold heavily. The "33rd", "35th", and "48th" series saw particularly strong selling, so while this month's "E kind" bonds rose by two jiao, forward contracts remained sluggish. Later, due to heavy selling, "54th series" no longer needed to buy. Fortunately, "72nd series" covered their shorts, so the later contracts dropped only slightly, about three jiao. In the second session, buyers became scarcer and selling intensified, causing a further drop of one or two jiao. In the afternoon opening, "16th", "23rd", and "43rd" series covered shorts, but northern players continued to sell heavily, leading to a further drop of two or three jiao. Trading closed stable, with retail investors making slight purchases, causing a minor rebound of one or two jiao. The overall trend is avoidance, making a significant rebound unlikely. Breaking the 60-yuan mark is within expectations. Whether the bulls can muster enough strength for further buying remains to be seen. Any recovery is likely to be short-lived and limited. Yesterday's market prices fell by one to five jiao. The total turnover was 6,825,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3 id="e157">Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Cotton Prices Rise, Spun Yarn Market Sentiment Solidifies, Short Sellers Cover Slightly <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The yarn and cloth market is calm and trending stably, mainly because overseas yarn and cotton prices have risen, solidifying market sentiment. Demand for spot yarn from Yunnan and Sichuan players remains healthy, but other players show no progress. With the lunar New Year approaching, commercial customs require a period of closure, so spot trading remains sluggish.</p>
<p>Spun Yarn Initially Rises Then Slightly Falls</p>
<p>At the opening of the spun yarn market, prices for all months rose due to continued increases in foreign cotton prices, boosting market sentiment. Short sellers covered positions slightly, with prices rising by six to seven jiao. However, the market saw little change later, due to the impact of the sharp drop in the Guangdong currency exchange rate, weakening buying interest. As a result, prices for all months rose by five, six, seven jiao to one yuan one jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, prices for each month were uneven, with the morning's two or three jiao gains. After the second session, the market remained mediocre. Spot yarn trading for Sichuan and Yunnan remained good. In the end, prices for all months fell by one jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,950 bales of Dafu yarn, 700 bales of Yuda yarn, 2,200 bales of Xingchang yarn, 1,450 bales of Shenji yarn, 600 bales of Renfeng yarn, 700 bales of Xiacheng yarn, 800 bales of Shengyuan yarn, 1,700 bales of Xincheng yarn, 400 bales of Dafeng yarn, and 800 bales of Changfeng yarn. Purchases included 1,800 bales of Mingde yarn, 2,950 bales of Gengfeng yarn, 550 bales of Hengde yarn, 900 bales of Yichang yarn, 1,100 bales of Runkang yarn, 700 bales of Jinghua yarn, 1,000 bales of Xinhua yarn, and 450 bales of Hexing yarn. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales in Yunnan and Sichuan Remain Good</p>

<p>The cotton market is trending firm, with a lively situation. Overseas Indian and American cotton markets are rising steadily, pushing up calculated prices daily and boosting market sentiment. However, most players are concerned that coarse cotton sales remain weak, and new long positions are not seen enthusiastically. Only Runkang reportedly bought 9,700 dan.</p>
<p>Two or Three Jiao, Market Sentiment Improves, Sellers Scarce, Market Tightens, Rumors of Active Coarse Cotton Trading, Prices for All Months Rise One and a Half to Two or Three Jiao Compared to Previous Day's Closing Price. In the afternoon opening, short-term momentum was quite strong, and Runkang came to buy again. By closing, longer-term contracts weakened. Prices for all months rose by one jiao in near-term contracts and fell by five fen in longer-term contracts compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,200 dan of Jifeng cotton, 1,800 dan of Deda cotton, 4,000 dan of Juxing cotton, 1,500 dan of Mingde cotton, 1,700 dan of Changfeng cotton, 1,200 dan of Xiacheng cotton, 1,500 dan of Yongchang cotton, 1,100 dan of Xinchang cotton, 2,700 dan of Yuanxingchang cotton, 2,100 dan of Ruida cotton, and 1,000 dan of Hengchang cotton.

<p>Yesterday, American cotton prices rose in near-term contracts due to limit-up buying, while longer-term contracts weakened due to long positions taking profits and rain in the east. There were few sellers, and hedging sales from the south were limited. Later reports indicated that the eastern rainfall did not alleviate the drought, as only coastal areas received heavy rain, while inland areas received very little. As a result, market prices rose again. Hestia estimated this week's factory consumption at 204,000 bales, and Liverpool's stock at 297,000 bales. Short positions covered before the close, and traders and Wall Street bought, stabilizing the market. Spot prices rose by three pound sterling, and futures prices rose by three to thirteen pound sterling. The English cotton market was closed. Indian cotton prices initially weakened due to profit-taking on July/August contracts, but then strengthened due to speculators buying April/May contracts and short covering on July/August contracts. Pingguoer rose/fell by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.75 rupees, and Bairuo creek rose by one rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 5th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for Bairuo creek cotton on the 6th was 214 rupees, an increase of 1.5 rupees from the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, various rumors gradually clarified the truth. Overseas cotton markets continue to rise strongly, and exchange cotton prices have also risen, improving sentiment in the cotton cloth industry. Eastern goods, especially fine cloth, are quite active. Tianjin players are selling brands like "Double Dragon Pearl", "Blue Double Fish", "Dragon Head", "Yanghe", and "Jixiang" with 200 pieces, and fine twill with 50 pieces. The Guangdong currency has fallen sharply, and there is still no stable solution, causing sales of piece goods in Guangdong and Guangxi to stop completely. Sales in Sichuan and Yunnan are slightly stronger. Sichuan players are buying about 100+ pieces of greige and gray fine twill, Shilin cloth, modern blue cloth, and various colored cloths from various factories. Yunnan players are buying 200+ pieces of Zhigong, Serge, blue cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Hunan province continues to buy dozens of pieces of white goods and patterned goods. Procurement of Serge and Gong Ni from Yantai and Qingdao in the northern route is gradually increasing. Currently, customers from various distant routes are continuing to purchase autumn goods, while summer goods are only being replenished in nearby areas, making the market quite weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw rising prices for all months after the opening in the morning. Overseas wheat prices were quoted down one or two jiao in Chicago. The weather in Canada was also dry and sunny, which historically should have led to a smaller trend. However, the current environment has changed slightly, because rumors of incidents have not subsided, raising concerns about smooth transportation in the future. As a result, even with the new crop coming out and favorable harvest weather, market sentiment is pricing in risk. The opening price for this month reached 3 yuan 07 fen 7 li 5 hao, and forward contracts also rose one or two fen. Later, some bulls exited positions in this month's contracts, softening market sentiment, and prices for all months fell by almost a fen. By the afternoon opening, trading was not as active as in the morning, but the market steadily increased, as outside buyers heard rumors that some factories were covering futures, drawing close attention. Buyers rushed in, and prices were pushed up, increasing by two or three fen compared to the previous day. June contracts traded flat due to profit-taking and short covering. According to industry insiders, this year's wheat harvest is actually better than in previous years, so this涨势反跌 is inevitable.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a sudden surge in prices for all months at the opening in the morning, due to rumors of incidents affecting future deliveries, and because the opening prices for new wheat were not as low as expected. Those with hypersensitivity tightly guarded against Eastern merchants buying, so market sentiment was swayed, and buying interest was strong. The June opening price suddenly jumped by one jiao, and the highest price reached two jiao eight fen, a reduction of one jiao three fen. Other months also initially increased by seven or eight fen. Later, long positions were rolled out, falling back one, two, or three fen. By the afternoon opening, the weather in June was still good, and customers had slightly hedged sales, falling back seven fen compared to the morning. Trading in July and later months remained brisk, and prices stabilized. Given the current situation, if the rumors subside and sources become abundant, a bearish trend is likely. Spot wheat was also boosted by three fen. The opening price was 250 bales, and Yaowan wheat was 4 yuan 4 jiao 2 fen.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various players totaled over 20, with over 4,000 shi of goods arriving. Sales in this street remained weak, and northern players only bought 400-500 bales. The market situation was stable, as sellers were unwilling to cut prices further, so although trading was light, the situation remained stable. Thick and thin japonica rice prices showed no changes. Duyangjian and Yinbianyuan were also similar.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 24-25 ships arrived from various routes along the river. Sales of white japonica rice on the market were still sluggish in the morning, and prices showed a weakening trend again. Demand improved in the afternoon, and prices actually strengthened.

<p>Yesterday, arrivals and sales of guest indica rice were both slow, and the market remained soft and lifeless. Although Fuzhou players continued to buy 250 bags of Jiangbei machine-milled rice, sales were minimal, failing to lift the sluggish rice market. The street has lacked strong demand for a long time. Purchases were slightly better yesterday, but the market did not continue to fall. Sales included 1,400 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, 600 bags of machine-milled early rice, and another 300 bags of Qialadi rice, which were sold by囤户 at a price that was one jiao and a half lower than before.

<h3 id="e171">Determination <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Wanwen</p>
<p>Little friends! Before I talk about determination, I must first analyze it. "Decision" means to decide, and "heart" is the heart in the human body. The meaning of "decision" is to decide with your heart. In fact, how can the heart decide? This is all the work of the brain, but it is a common saying. I will follow this saying to talk about determination.</p>
<p>The words "determination" sound very familiar. Looking at them seems ordinary. Why did I write about it? Because determination is the main condition for promoting the success of a career. I will give a few examples to prove it. Inventors made a determination before inventing various things that benefit the world. Dr. Sun Yat-sen made a determination before there was the Republic of China. Their success was of course caused by various reasons, but determination is also one of them. If you want to do something, and your mind is hesitant, listening to this person saying to do it and that person saying not to do it, then this thing will never succeed. In short, when a person is alive, he must have determination in everything he does.</p>
<p>However, if determination is used inappropriately, not only will it not be beneficial, but it will be harmful. Therefore, when you want to do something, use your mind to judge whether you want to be determined or not. I said earlier, "You must have determination in everything you do," but now I say, "You must judge the application of determination." Don't you all think this is contradictory? Let me explain it now. Everything has good and bad aspects, and good and bad have no fixed standard. Use your judgment to decide if this matter is beneficial, then resolve to do it. If it is useless, discard it. In this way, determination is your good friend, able to help you succeed in your career and get good results.</p>

<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>A Ten-Year-Old Musician</p>
<p>In the village of Osde Tudde in the Vistula River basin in southern Poland, there is a farmer's son named Buglai Mountain, who is only ten and a half years old this year, but he can play the piano very well. His father is very poor, so he has been studying in a free school since he was seven years old, but he can only study for two or three hours a day. The rest of his time is spent in his father's small pasture. Listening to the cold breeze from the Baltic Sea attacking the trees of varying heights around the pasture, he feels a kind of indescribably pleasant melody. In the late spring weather, listening to the sounds of various birds chirping from near and far, he feels that it is full of musical meaning. From the age of eight, he asked his father to buy him a small violin, and he played along with the sounds of nature in the pasture. Although his playing has no score, the gentle tone often attracts neighbors to gather around and listen to him play. Therefore, he is even happier, forgetting the responsibility of the work his father gave him. After repeated warnings from his father, his interest in playing did not diminish, and his violin was finally destroyed by his father. But this news was soon learned by a pastor in the church, so he agreed with his father to teach him to play the piano. No matter what the tune, he can learn it as soon as he learns it, and the excellent technique shows that he is rich in musical talent. The old pastor was very happy and taught him wholeheartedly. Last Christmas, he took him to Lublin to perform publicly and raise relief funds for poor children. As a result, he obtained a lot of money. Recently, I heard that the pastor has筹有欵 for him and will send him to France for further study.</p>
<p>A Thirteen-Year-Old Painter</p>
<p>Outside the city of Valences, on the Rhone River in France, lives a very poor family. The head of the family is a widow near fifty years old, named Mrs. Meigen Lee. A family of five lives on a few dairy cows. Her husband was an unknown painter who left behind four minor children, and the situation was very bleak. But her third daughter, Maria, has loved to paint since she was a child, and often copies her father's works, which she finds very interesting. From the age of ten, she worked even harder on painting. At the age of eleven, she opened a solo exhibition in the city of Valences. She sold a painting of "Dusk in Valences" for 300 francs. A painting of "Beggar and Dog" sold for 150 francs. In the spring of 1935, she held a solo exhibition outside the city of Lyon. A painting of "Jesus on the Cross" was priced at 600 francs and was finally sold for 750 francs. Her painting skills were entirely self-taught, and she has never been instructed by a famous teacher. Now, a distant relative has volunteered to help her study in Paris. The future accomplishments of this talented female painter are bound to be limitless.</p>

<p>One day, Washington questioned his secretary why he was late. His secretary replied that it was because the clock at his house was slow. Washington said sternly, "Then you can buy a correct clock! If you don't do this, I will immediately hire someone else." From then on, his secretary did not dare to be late again.</p>
<p>Napoleon invited guests one night, and when it was time to take their seats, the generals had not yet arrived. He sat down to eat alone. When he had finished eating and was about to leave the table, he saw the generals coming in. He nodded to the generals and said, "Now the time to eat has passed. Please go back to your respective duties." The late generals withdrew with blushing faces.</p>
<p>Little friends! Have you ever been late to school? "Lateness" is a very bad habit that will cultivate your laziness. Little friends, if you have ever been late, please correct it from today onwards.</p>

<p>Zhi'er is De'er's older brother. He's probably only thirteen years old this year! He does seem to be a little smarter than ordinary people. You only need to see him staring and contemplating all day long with lively and sharp eyes to know that his mind is very deep.</p>
<p>These past few days, De'er has always seen Zhi'er staring at the sky, not knowing what he is doing, so De'er asked him suspiciously:</p>
<p>"Brother! What are you always looking at in the sky?"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll tell you! I've recently discovered that watching clouds is really the best way to pass the time." Zhi'er replied to his younger brother with a smile.</p>
<p>"Why is watching clouds the best way to pass the time?"</p>
<p>"For example, in the morning you see the clouds are red, yellow, purple, and blue, but when you look at them again in the middle of the day, they're different. Every cloud is as white as snow, like sailboats sailing quickly. If you look closely, there are cows, horses, and people, but if you look again, everything is gone. Especially on rainy days, the sky is full of dark clouds, like countless dragons swimming around in them, which is really beautiful. Brother! Don't underestimate it, it is indeed much better than movies and dramas! If you don't believe me, you might as well try it!" Sure enough, within a few days, De'er also contracted his brother's癖了.</p>

<p>——An Interesting World Time Difference Chart——</p>
<p>Bright sunlight shines on our Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth rotates from west to east. One rotation is a day. We clever humans have divided this rotation time into twenty-four hours. So, one rotation of the Earth is twenty-four hours, which is one day.</p>
<p>The part of the Earth that receives sunlight is bright, which we call daytime. Only part of the Earth receives sunlight; the other part does not. The area without sunlight is called nighttime.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the same moment on Earth, some places have the sun directly overhead, which is noon; some places have the sun setting, which is afternoon; some places have the sun just going down, which is dusk; some places have the sun just rising, which is morning; and some places have no sun and are completely dark, which is night.</p>
<p>When we are eating lunch, people in different parts of the world are either getting up and washing their faces; some are carrying their schoolbags to school; some have finished lunch and are already in class; some are finishing school for the evening; some are already eating dinner; some are going to bed; and some are dreaming sweet dreams in bed.</p>
<p>Why is there such a difference? It turns out that the Earth is a sphere, and the time in different places on Earth is based on the sun—when the sun is directly overhead, it is noon. We divide the Earth into 360 degrees, and dividing 360 degrees by 24 gives us exactly 15 degrees per unit. Therefore, as the sun shines on the Earth, there is a one-hour difference every 15 degrees. Using this method to calculate the time in different parts of the world, we find that:</p>
<p>If it is 9:00 AM in Shanghai, then it is: 8:00 AM in Singapore; 7:00 AM in Calcutta, India; 3:30 AM in Moscow; 1:00 AM in London; 8:00 PM in New York; 5:00 PM in San Francisco; 2:30 PM in Hawaii; and 10:30 AM in Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>How can we know the time difference in different parts of the world?</p>
<p>Now I have a very simple method to teach children. As long as the children use their hands and do it themselves, they can easily succeed, and they don't need to spend money to buy any tools or materials. Just ask the children to prepare:</p>
<p>A pair of scissors, a piece of cardboard (about one square foot in size), a brass paper fastener, and some glue.</p>
<p>Haven't you all seen the circular map attached to the front? This map is a miniature of the world map (it widens the portion of the Southern Hemisphere). Because it is centered on the North Pole, looking at all directions of the Earth from the North Pole, the shapes of the land and sea on the surface become flat and wide.</p>
<p>Children, cut out this map, following the circular line; after cutting it out, paste it on the cardboard and cut the cardboard into a circle as well. Then, cut out the small circular diagram in the lower right corner that shows day and night and time, and paste it on the cardboard, also cutting it into a circle. Don't use too much or too little glue; apply it evenly.</p>
<p>After cutting out these two circles, one large and one small, make a hole in the center of each circle, place the small circle on the North Pole of the map—that is, the center—and then insert a brass paper fastener through the holes, folding the legs of the fastener on the back of the map. In this way, the world time difference checker is complete.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to check what time it is in major cities around the world when it is noon in Shanghai. You only need to align the number 12 on the small dial with the meridian of Shanghai. Then you can see the time in different places: Tokyo is 1:30 PM; Brisbane is 2:10 PM; Fiji is a little before 4:00 PM; Hawaii is 5:30 PM; San Francisco is 8:00 PM; New York is 11:10 PM; Rio de Janeiro is a little after 1:00 AM; London is 4:00 AM; Rome is 5:00 AM; Moscow is 6:30 AM; and so on, checking back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>If you want to use noon in London as the standard to check the time in different parts of the world, you can also do it according to the above method to find out.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm done talking. Please get to work, kids! The order of doing it is:</p>
<p>First, find the tools and materials; second, do it according to the method; third, play according to the method. Fourth, after playing, think of ways to improve it, or invent a method that is more convenient, or other new and valuable things to play with.</p>
<p>Small Scientific Question</p>
<h3 id="e177">Why Do Bubbles Appear on the Water Surface When a Brick Is Thrown into It? <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Xi</p>
<p>If we casually take a brick and throw it into the water, bubbles will appear on the surface of the water in an instant. What is the reason for this? I am afraid that not many children know about this. Let me explain it simply:</p>
<p>When an object is thrown into water, it floats if it is lighter than the same volume of water; it sinks if it is heavier than the same volume of water. At the same time, the weight lost by an object in water is equal to the weight of the water displaced. Then, when we throw a brick into the water, it naturally sinks because it is heavier than the same volume of water. As it sinks, the water in contact with it is squeezed and dispersed around it, temporarily leaving a gap in the middle. However, the density and specific gravity of the air are both less than that of water, so although the gap is full of air, the density of the water near it is greater than that of the air, naturally because of the effect of surface tension. Quickly, it will compete to fill the gap to maintain its horizontal level, and the air in the gap is forced to have nowhere to go, so it is surrounded by the water film part by part, and becomes many air pockets of different sizes, rising up and floating on the surface of the water, which becomes the bubbles we usually see. When the bubbles break, the air will disperse. If you don't believe me, you can try it right away.</p>

<p>One day, the teacher hit his palm ten times. He was very angry and thought: It's the clock's fault, it runs too fast.</p>
<p>When he returned home, he turned the short hand of the clock back one space.</p>
<p>The next day, when he arrived at school, the first class had already ended. He was very surprised. He thought, isn't my clock only eight o'clock? How could a class have already been taught?</p>
<p>The teacher saw him and asked sternly:</p>
<p>"Why are you so late today?"</p>
<p>He cried and sobbed:</p>
<p>"I thought: As long as I slow down the clock at home, school will start later, but I didn't know..."</p>

<p>Dissolve a few pieces of alum in water, dip a clean brush in this alum water and write words or draw pictures on Chinese paper. After it dries, there will be no trace on the paper. But if you drag this paper in clear water, the writing on it will immediately become transparent and appear.</p>
<p>Dip a brush in rice water and write on the paper, then put it in water with iodine (available in ordinary pharmacies), and your handwriting will appear blue on the paper.</p>
<p>Write words on paper with milk, and after it dries, it will be a blank piece of paper, but if you bake it over a fire, the yellow writing will be clearly visible.</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Mrs.柯甘士 dared not say anything aloud, but when she waited until 老达士's coffin was buried, 小南洛 and 柏德希 left, she gave a small wreath to her daughter 小洛, asking her to respectfully send it to the grave. She only saw a dark earthen mound standing in the snow.</p>
<p>小南洛 and 柏德希 returned home very sadly. But that desolate and lonely small house could no longer give them the slightest comfort. 老达士 still had one month's rent unpaid when he died, but 小南洛 did not have a single copper coin left after burying his old grandfather. He went to beg the owner of the small house, who was a shoemaker. He always smoked and drank with the miller 柯甘士 on Sunday nights. He ignored 小南洛's begging. He was cruel and stingy, and had always loved money like his life. He took all the pots, kettles, sticks, and stones in the small house to pay off the rent he was owed, and immediately ordered 小南洛 to move out tomorrow.</p>
<p>The house was small and low, simply shapeless, but they had lived there for too long, and they were very reluctant to leave. They had always been very happy living here. Every summer, the house was covered with vines, and the bean flowers bloomed fragrantly, setting off the sun-drenched fields, making the scenery even more beautiful. Although they worked hard and endured the taste of poverty on weekdays, they were very satisfied and happy in their hearts. Every night, they would always run back to see the old man's welcoming smile.</p>
<p>That night, 小南洛 and 柏德希 sat in the dark all night, next to the cold and fireless fireplace, holding each other tightly to keep warm. They did not feel very cold, but their hearts seemed to be frozen.</p>
<p>Dawn broke, and the morning light filled the snow-white and frozen earth. It was the morning of Christmas Eve. 小南洛 shivered, hugged his only good friend 柏德希 tightly, and drops of hot tears dripped on 柏德希's forehead. He said in a low voice, "Let's go! 柏德希 - dear 柏德希! We never want to wait to be kicked out by the landlord, let's go ourselves first."</p>
<p>柏德希 originally had no opinion, only obeying the orders of its young master. The two of them walked out of this beloved small house sadly. They felt that anything worthless in the house was very precious and lovely. 柏德希 walked past his green cart with his head drooping: it was no longer his. This cart and many other things had to be used to pay off the rent owed, as well as the copper driving object, lying shiny in the snow. When 柏德希 saw these two treasures that he had depended on for life, he simply wanted to lie down next to them and die immediately, but its young master was still alive and needed it. It still had to cheer up and fight on.</p>
<p>They walked on the road to 盎凡尔 that they used to walk every day. It was not yet dawn, and the windows of the houses were still closed. There were only a few villagers on the road. They did not pay attention when 小南洛 and 柏德希 passed by. 小南洛 stopped in front of a house and looked inside earnestly: his old grandfather had always been enthusiastic about helping this family when he was alive.</p>
<p>He said timidly: "Please, can you give 柏德希 some breadcrumbs? It is old and has not eaten anything since yesterday afternoon." The woman in the house immediately closed the door and muttered something about how expensive wheat and rice were this year. Poor 小南洛 and 柏德希 had no choice but to walk forward weakly; they never begged for food from others again.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Critique of the "Latent Military Power Theory" <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Jun</p>
<p>In 1931, the International Parliamentary Union, affiliated with the League of Nations, published a collection of essays entitled "How Will Future Wars Be?". This collection included articles by Professor Fried of France, General Menkil of Germany, Professor Aono of Japan, and others. They began to broadly raise the issue of "latent military power." Professor Fried's views can be said to be representative of this theory. His starting point was: "War depends on military power, and equally on economic and financial power." Therefore, he believed that economic and financial power plays a very important role in determining the outcome of a war. He first stated that his own research was limited to the economic elements of "latent military power," and therefore he avoided exploring "pure latent military power" and "spiritual and political latent military power."</p>
<p>Professor Fried believed that "pure latent military power" referred to "geographical location, the time and conditions for mobilizing national resources, the differences in manpower, armaments, and material components, the quality and education of the military, and other factors." As for "spiritual and political latent power," it referred to "the identity and unity of the residents, the disharmony of the system, and other factors." However, he considered both of these to be unimportant and did not study them specifically. In this way, he actually placed "economic latent power" outside of social relations and observed it separately from direct military factors. He considered "military and political latent power" to be "the research object of military technicians and politicians." He only paid attention to "economic latent military power" and divided it into three constituent parts: First, "the human element or demographic element." This latent power is A: "There should be many men between the ages of sixteen and sixty for military production, and the national composition of geographically concentrated production should be harmonious." B: "The stronger the residents' ability to restrain their own consumption, the greater this latent power will be." Second, "the technical element." This consists of A: agricultural productivity, B: raw materials and power resources, and C: industry and transportation. Third, "the economic and financial element": A: the burden capacity of the people, B: the country's borrowing power, and C: the ability to pay foreign debts.</p>
<p>Regarding Professor Fried's views, we believe that the first thing worth noting is that he believes that "political latent power" is the object of research for politicians and has nothing to do with his problem, but in the "human element" he proposed, he mentioned the importance of the national identity of the residents. This very obviously involved political factors, causing his research and his central argument to have irreconcilable contradictions.</p>
<p>Secondly, Professor Fried raised the issue of "the ability of residents to restrain their own consumption." But what determines this ability? He did not answer clearly. In fact, the so-called "ability of the people to restrain their own consumption" is not only an economic issue, but also a political issue. In capitalist countries, once a war breaks out, it is necessary to further restrict the consumption of the general working people and try to squeeze their blood and sweat to fill the war expenses. Such restraint of consumption is obviously not due to the wishes of the majority of the people, but is forcibly implemented with violence. As a result, the greater the power of this consumption restraint, the more the majority of the people will feel pain, the more they will ignite the spirit of resistance to this restraint and all oppression, and thus the more they will sharpen domestic contradictions, so as to weaken or even fundamentally eliminate its original external war-fighting ability. From this point of view, it can be seen that the so-called "ability to restrain consumption" is closely related to the political form of the country, and problems cannot be correctly concluded only by explaining the problem from the general economic situation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the so-called "burden capacity of the people" is of great importance to war, but the problem cannot be decided by general measurement. Taking the general capitalist countries as an example, because power is concentrated in the hands of a few wealthy people, they will not only try to avoid their own many tax burdens during wartime, but also cleverly change the tax system to benefit themselves. As a result, the economic burden of the war is mainly placed on the heads of the general poor people, making the general people more impoverished. In this way, it can be seen that the problem of "people's burden capacity" is not only a simple economic problem, but is related to fundamental social problems.</p>
<p>In addition to Fried, the German pacifist Lussbinert is also a noteworthy "latent military power theorist." Like Fried, he started from the nature of future wars and first pointed out the characteristics of this war: "The distinction between combatants and non-combatants will disappear, and the front will not be the firing line of the opposing armies, but the organic whole of the entire country, the contention of the tertiary mobilization of the entire national economic organization." Needless to say, this also mainly interprets "latent military power" as economic latent power.</p>
<p>However, in detail, Lussbinert believed that "latent military power" is composed of the following elements: 1. "Spiritual factors, namely military capabilities, inventiveness, such as the political foresight to conclude alliances." 2. "Biological factors, namely residents, agriculture (including livestock), fuel resources, and raw materials for the textile industry." 3. "Mineralogical factors, namely undeveloped resources such as coal, iron ore, petroleum, special metals, and raw materials for the chemical industry, and mineral fertilizers." 4. "Industrial factors, namely transportation and transportation means, machinery manufacturing industry, water sources for making mechanical power or electricity sources, hydropower, and others."</p>
<p>In this way, the elements of "latent military power" as explained by Lussbinert are somewhat different from those of Fried, that is, the former puts certain political elements into the so-called "latent military power." For example, the "spiritual factors" he cited can be said to be certain political factors. But unfortunately, he narrowed the problem. He only saw the importance of political foresight and the ability to conclude alliances, but did not think of the more important issues of social systems and political forms. What is even more ridiculous is that he actually cited "inventiveness" as a decisive factor, masking the particularly important points of the problem. Therefore, his "latent military power theory" ultimately still takes economic latent power as the determining factor.</p>
<p>Lussbinert especially emphasized the importance of metals and , believing that this has the greatest determining role. Based on this view, he</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>explained many famous wars of the past. He believed that in the war between Austria and Prussia, Prussia won only because it had a large amount of pig iron production; the reason for Germany's victory in the Franco-Prussian War was the same; as for the American Civil War, in his opinion, the North had abundant coal and metal, so it defeated the agricultural South; afterwards, he further said, based on this , that in the World War of 1914-18, Germany's victory over Russia was due to its greater industrial power; but because its industrial power was not as good as that of Britain and the United States, it finally failed. Thus - he concluded: "In future wars, those who have the best and most abundant raw material resources and the best methods and means of producing war machines will surely win." However, unfortunately, in explaining an important war in the past, he forgot the war in which the capitalist countries of the world besieged the Soviet Union in 1918-20; according to Lussbinert's explanation, the use of the natural wealth and industrial power of the capitalist world to attack the nascent Soviet Union would inevitably be a success and achieve a complete victory, but the result was unexpectedly that the interventionist troops of the great powers retreated in defeat. This incident was a difficult problem that Lussbinert's "latent military power theory" encountered in the course of its theoretical development and could not explain, so he simply abandoned it deliberately.</p>
<p>It is true that a country's economic power, what people call "latent military power," is quite related to war, but this must be combined with military armed forces, social systems, political forms, and the lives and thoughts of the people and soldiers to make an overall observation before it has meaning. It cannot be taken as the sole determining factor to explain the problem. For example, the current capitalist countries, although their industries are very developed and their financial resources are relatively abundant, are very dangerous in the process of war because the contradictions among the people in the country are becoming increasingly acute and the thoughts and actions of the people and even the army are not unified. In this way, if the people and nations oppressed by them can consistently to the end, they will surely win the final victory. According to the theory of the "latent military power theorists" mentioned above, the victor of future wars must be a country with highly developed industry, abundant raw materials, and abundant financial resources, then imperialists like the United States will inevitably win, as for the weak and small nations in the poor and weak colonies and semi-colonies and the general poor people, they will never be able to turn themselves over. This is really the view of the rich and powerful imperialism!</p>
<p>In fact, the "latent military power theory" mentioned above is produced by the great powers in the struggle of "disarmament" and "expansion of armaments". For example, in the past, in order to oppose Germany's expansion of armaments, Briand Ren especially attracted people's attention to the development of German industry and pointed out the power of this "latent military power". Also, when true pacifists put forward the proposition of complete disarmament, the great powers became panicked and immediately used the "latent military power theory" to deal with it, saying that the "latent military power" of various countries' chemical industry, automobile industry, machinery industry, etc. cannot be eliminated, so complete disarmament is impossible. - It is not surprising that the so-called "latent military power theory" produced in this way has expressed the views mentioned above, right?</p>
<p>Confession of a Professional Woman</p>
<h3 id="e182">Female Actress <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— A Talk by Ms. Zheng Mengxia</p>
<p>I am from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. It was originally called Xiangshan to commemorate Mr. Sun Zhongshan before being renamed Zhongshan. At the age of fifteen, my father went to Shanghai to do business, and I went to Shanghai with him. I studied at Qiming Girls' School in Xujiahui. Since I was a child, I liked to hum Peking Opera tunes and often went to the theater with my father. Moreover, I have always had a natural love for music, and records are my good friends. Counting it all up, I have been fascinated by the melodies and studied Peking Opera for almost fifteen years.</p>
<p>Looking back to when I was nineteen, I made a guest appearance at the old Grand Stage on Sanma Road in Shanghai. That was my first public performance of Peking Opera. After that, I often performed in private gatherings. I have joined famous amateur Peking Opera troupes in Shanghai such as "Shenshang," "Zhengyi Society," and "Jingwu Athletic Association Peking Opera Department."</p>
<p>In 1934, I organized my own Shanghai Wanlian Opera Troupe and went south to perform at the Queen's Theatre in Hong Kong, the Xinhua Theatre in Guangzhou, and other theaters. When forming the troupe, I received help from my second husband, Mr. Guan Hongbin; and in Hong Kong and Guangdong, I also received support from friends and various sectors. However, my goal was not to make money; so although each ticket was once sold for more than three yuan and three jiao, I did not actually make much profit. In addition to performing Peking Opera, I also performed dancing with Mr. Chen Gaocong, which was relatively more popular.</p>
<p>Before going south, perhaps it was a coincidence? At the China National Dancing Competition organized by the Victory Radio Company, Mr. Chen Gaocong and I danced together. He was selected as the "Dancing King" of China; and I was unexpectedly selected as the "Dancing Queen." My intention was to continue to improve my skills, so I often invited famous European and American dance artists to give guidance. The same was true for Peking Opera.</p>
<p>My first teacher of Peking Opera, whose great name is Chen Xiangyun, was none other than Xiao Xixi, an old opera performer with great influence in the court of Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty. Later, I also studied under Mr. Guan Hongbin. It was Mr. Guan who introduced me to join the Shenshang amateur troupe.</p>
<p>I was not a child actor who started learning opera from a young age; I am considered an amateur who entered the profession. Therefore, I am not very familiar with the life of child actors. Generally speaking, if someone is naturally dull and forced to learn opera, and they encounter a teacher with a bad temper, they may inevitably suffer scolding and whipping. As for me? I can be considered a very comfortable and fortunate person. Most of the people I interact with are amateurs, and I can learn a lot just by being around them. In the past, Mr. Chen was good at elegant and martial Qingyi (virtuous female roles) and Huashan (vivacious female roles). Mr. Guan was proficient in all roles including Qingyi, Huashan, Sheng (male roles), Jing (painted-face male roles), and Chou (comedic roles).</p>
<p>Here, I might as well talk a little about the rules for learning Peking Opera and apprenticing to a teacher. According to the old rules, one must light incense and candles and perform a kneeling ceremony. Moreover, every time one goes on stage, one must also perform a kneeling ceremony in front of the ancestral master's seat backstage. Usually, one only needs to prepare a "guan shu" (apprenticeship contract) and bow three times to the teacher, but one must still kowtow in front of the ancestral master's seat backstage to show respect. When sending the "guan shu," one must find an introducer and a witness to sign and affix their seals. The content of the "guan shu" is roughly as follows: "The person establishing this apprenticeship contract, ××× (stating age and birthday), hereby entrusts ××× to introduce them and, after discussing the matter on three sides, voluntarily apprentices to Mr. ××× to learn opera (stating how the performance fees earned within a certain number of years will be split. After the term is over, ××× will personally take them back, etc.)."</p>
<p>I am truly particularly interested in Peking Opera. I think that the old plays that are very meaningful and that I have worked hard to learn include "Hongluanxi," "Huatian Cuo," "Hongniguan," and "Fengyang Flower Drum," etc. But what I find very incomprehensible is that the more effort I put into practicing the old plays, the fewer people welcome them. Therefore, on several occasions, I have had to rely on my Westernized dancing on the Peking Opera stage.</p>
<p>I have been to Beijing and Tianjin. I performed at the Beiyang Theatre in Tianjin, and the box office was good. I partnered with Mr. Ye Shenglan at the Huale Theatre in Beijing. The "Shi Bao" and "Li Yan Bao" newspapers in Beijing have given me a lot of guidance, encouragement, and praise. But I feel that, in my current environment, it is difficult to live up to everyone's expectations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Guan, my Qin player (musician), and several other friends who I had dealings with could not avoid taking me to court. Although it did not cause much trouble, I have gained a lot of a sense of vicissitudes because of it.</p>
<p>I once joined a troupe at the Tianchan Stage in Shanghai. This was because Mr. Zhao Ruquan praised my performance of "Hongluanxi," a play that I had worked hard to learn, and then contacted me. So, I feel that effort is still a necessary condition for life.</p>
<p>I, like a man, understand other people's psychology very well. I would not dare to say that a person is not sometimes used by others, but even if they are used, they will one day achieve their correct goal.</p>
<p>Book and Newspaper Review</p>
<h3 id="e183">Review of "Women's Resonance," Volume 5, Issue 4 <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Yu Xi</p>
<p>—Publisher: 63 Chengxian Street, Nanjing. Price: One Dime per copy—</p>
<p>"Women's Resonance" is also a relatively old women's publication. I have read several issues before, but its views were not very correct. Also, the writing style was often stagnant and lacked liveliness and conciseness. Recently, I heard that the editor had been changed and that some reorganization and improvement had been made, so I bought it to read again. The one I read was Volume 5, Issue 4.</p>
<p>Judging solely from the articles I read, both the viewpoints and the writing techniques have indeed improved compared to the past. In some respects, it can even be said to be a progressive publication. The arrangement of the articles is relatively harmonious, because it has not fallen into the error of many previous women's publications, which only talked about partial women's issues in a self-enclosed way and forgot about politics. Even when discussing women's issues, it is able to politicize them to a considerable extent, pointing out the path to liberation for women and the path to participating in actual political struggles. For example, the articles "Rumors of a Secret Sino-Soviet Pact," "The Atmosphere of War and the Smoke Screen of War," and "Bringing All of China Together" are purely commentaries on political issues, while the essays "The Line of the Women's Movement in Extraordinary Times" and "Review of the National Assembly Representative Issue" have also politicized women's issues to a considerable extent, pointing out how the women's movement should actually participate in political activities and the line of its activities. Even the article "The Misfortune of Working Women and its Solution" has an indication of a general social and political way out. It is very correct to be able to discuss women's issues without being far from politics. In addition to these texts, there are also historical materials, descriptions of women's lives, and literary and artistic works, which also show that it is not monotonous and dry. Generally speaking, the writing style is also somewhat interesting, concise, and lively, which is also worth mentioning incidentally.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it also has many shortcomings. The first thing we want to say is that some of the essays do not have a sufficiently firm and correct political stance. Therefore, when instructing women on how to engage in political struggle and lead a political life, they lack a certain social class perspective and give some incorrect route instructions. For example, the translated article "Women's Career—Politics" was written by the wife of the highest ruler of the United States, Roosevelt. What is the intention of taking the preaching of the imperialists and using it to educate one's own oppressed female masses? Moreover, the content of her article does not have any thought of resisting reality or transforming reality (of course, she would not have such thoughts). What she teaches women is only to tell them how to follow the existing rules step by step and carefully to raise their individual status and learn to be female politicians. Is this the guidance given to the women's liberation movement? Isn't this female politician clearly telling women to obey the current system and be good public servants, "loyal, courageous, and humble" public servants? If "Women's Resonance" wants to transform itself into a progressive publication at the forefront of the times, it should never publish such articles and use them to guide women's political lives.</p>
<p>Secondly, in this issue of "Women's Resonance," some articles with idealistic viewpoints are clearly mixed in. For example, the article "Women in the Eyes of Philosophers and Poets" completely attributes the reasons why those so-called philosophers and poets who despise women despise women to "feelings of inner guilt" and "jealous self-interest," etc., and seeks explanations from their personal relationships with women, rather than explaining how the social system and economic relations determine the reasons why these people inevitably despise women. This is an idealistic argument. Because if it is said that their opposition to women only stems from personal psychological feelings, for example, Confucius and Jesus opposed women because they hated their mothers for being unchaste, then why did all men in primitive society not have this psychology? At that time, the general children did not know who their father was, so why did the men at that time not despise their mothers? It is clear that the changes in social and economic relations and the social system formed a male-centered social consciousness, which determined these individual thoughts, and then they inevitably opposed women under the support of this social system, which was not dominated and produced by their personal psychological effects and feelings.</p>
<p>In addition, in this issue of the publication, the viewpoints of some articles are slightly expressed with a somewhat feminist color. Although this color is not very strong, a very progressive women's publication should completely eliminate this shortcoming. However, this issue of the publication cannot completely do so, and there is a tendency to simply oppose all men from the standpoint of women. For example, in the article "Women in the Eyes of Philosophers and Poets," because he does not look for the root cause of men's contempt for women from objective social changes, he says that there are only one in a million exceptions, and that there is not a single man who does not oppose women. In fact, as society has progressed to the present, all progressive elements of society and the broad masses of hard-working people, from the overall consciousness and tendency of his entire class, sympathize with women. Those men who stubbornly hold male-centered ideas are a minority of individuals, not an entire class, and there are many such people among women. The author may hate all men under the influence of a women-centered ideology, forgetting this fact. Another example is the article "Asking Ms. Chen Hengzhe for Advice on Surnames After Marriage." I think this small problem is not worth serious discussion. People like Chen Hengzhe and this kind of argument only need a small amount of sarcasm, and there is no need to discuss these trivial issues in a big way. Because if we argue about this issue so seriously, even if we can expose some facts of male-centered thinking, fully expressing that women must fight for the hereditary surnames of the patriarchal society is as meaningless and unreasonable as men in a male-centered society must maintain male surnames. In fact, it is wrong for men to insist that women take their surnames, as if they are treating women as their own possessions, and it is also the same mistake that women must fight for this right as men in the past. Moreover, women must fight to preserve their surnames, which does not mean that they have won any women's rights. In my opinion, men should not force women to take their surnames, as if they were treating women as their own property, but women do not necessarily have to preserve their surnames, even if they have women's rights. If this is the case, it is tantamount to treating the surnames of the patriarchal society as very precious, or to indicate that they must adhere to the position of women to confront men. This kind of thinking is backward and has a feminist color. People's names can be taken casually, so they can be taken as they please. If a woman takes any word from the man's surname or name as her own name in order to express her love for her man, as long as she is not forced to do so, there is no meaning of being insulted and despised, and it is possible. Conversely, if a man takes any word from the woman's name as his own name because he loves his woman very much, he will not be insulted and despised in the same way, and it is still possible. Such things are already very popular in modern society. If we discuss this issue as a big issue, this just shows that we must adhere to everything of women, regardless of whether it should be adhered to, and whether it is related to the real interests of women's liberation, which is a narrow feminist view.</p>
<p>I read this issue of "Women's Resonance," and I came up with so much criticism, but it is not to tell readers not to read it. In fact, in terms of its overall trend, it is still relatively progressive among women's publications. The general expression of dissatisfaction with reality and the general resistance of the dark side of society is still available. Even though it is slightly expressed with some women-centered thinking, this is the natural expression of the angry emotions of women who have been oppressed for thousands of years, and we should also forgive them to a considerable extent. However, for the sake of cherishing the publication, I hope that it will take another step forward in spirit and advocacy, completely eliminate these shortcomings, and more fully express its fighting spirit and correct theoretical viewpoints.</p>
<p>Customs and Traditions</p>
<h3 id="e184">Customs of the British Parliament <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Quan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Britain was the first country to experience the Industrial Revolution and is the home of parliamentary politics, but judging from its social system, customs, and everything else, it can be said to be the most conservative country. The so-called "Old Britain" is a general indication of its conservatism. Such conservatism can also be seen in its parliament.</p>
<p>First, Britain still has an emperor. When the parliament holds its opening ceremony, the King and Queen of England take a carriage decorated with gold and glass to the House of Lords. The nobles also come to the parliament hall wearing different gorgeous dresses and hats according to the differences in their ranks and titles. At the same time, noble ladies are also specially allowed to participate in this opening ceremony, and they wear even more gorgeous dresses inlaid with jewels. Therefore, the opening ceremony of the parliament is dazzling and grand, which is unmatched by other parliamentary political countries in the world.</p>
<p>Second, originally, the British parliament used a church, so many of the rituals of the church at that time are still preserved. For example, when members enter and leave the parliament hall, they must nod to the Speaker's seat to pay their respects. This can be said to be a sign of respect for the Speaker, but in fact, this situation is a ritual from the time when the parliament first used the church. Because at that time there was an image of Jesus on the altar in front of the Speaker, so members had to pay their respects to it. Now, although there is no altar and no image of Jesus, the conservative British still stubbornly retain that past ritual, so members still nod to the Speaker's seat when entering and leaving the parliament hall.</p>
<p>Third, there are also many differences in the situation when the House of Lords and the House of Commons meet. For example, when starting a speech, the House of Lords does not call the Speaker, but immediately calls the nobles and members of the House of Lords, but the House of Commons must first call the Speaker. Also, the Speaker of the House of Lords cannot decide the order of speakers during debates, so it often happens that two people speak at the same time. And even when the phenomenon of two people speaking at the same time occurs, the Speaker of the House of Lords has no right to decide who can speak first. This even has to be resolved by a vote of all members. However, the rights of the Speaker of the House of Commons are the same as those of the chairman of the meeting we usually see, which is the opposite of the former. Just looking at these two situations, we can say that the nobles of "Old Britain" are more "democratic" and "free" than its citizens, but at the same time, we can also say that this is a meeting hall habit inherited from the distinguished British nobles of the past.</p>
<p>Third, generally speaking, no matter which country it is, in a relatively grand parliament hall, all participants must take off their hats. But even now, when the British Parliament is in session, members do not take off their hats when sitting, but only take off their hats when standing up. Although this situation looks simple and unremarkable, it actually has its historical roots. Originally, when the British Parliament convened its first meeting, the participants included nobles, clergymen, and citizens. Among them, the nobles pretended to be very arrogant in order to show their superior status and did not take off their hats. And the newly emerged citizens at that time, although they opposed the nobles, also unconsciously imitated some of the airs of the nobles in order to show their gentlemanly demeanor. The above-mentioned situation in the current British Parliament is what has been conserved from the past.</p>
<p>Fourth, although British parliamentary politics has had hundreds of years of history, the cry of "Hearl Hearl" at the meeting is still preserved as it was at the beginning. For a motion, for the speaker's argument, whether it is warm applause, well-intentioned agreement, or angry opposition, fierce insult, and vicious satire, members express it by shouting "Hearl Hearl," only the pitch of the shout differs due to the difference in each person's tendency.</p>
<p>Finally, what I want to say is that when the British Parliament is in session, the famous London Big Ben will be lit up. Because in the past, when the King of England had greater power, it was very possible to violently suppress the parliament. In order to prevent such suppression, the British people installed large lights on this clock tower. If the lights are bright when the parliament is in session, the meeting is very safe. Conversely, if the lights are always dimmed, the meeting is being suppressed.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>Therefore, the citizens of London can rise up to resist. This situation was originally in the past era, but the conservative British still retain it to this day. So in London, as soon as we see the lights of the Big Ben tower bright, we know that the British Parliament is in session, without having to read the newspaper.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e185">On Encouraging Childbirth <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ximen</p>
<p>According to the Taian Daily, the Soviet Union has drafted a new legal system to increase the birth rate. Among them, abortion is a crime, and mothers with eight, nine, ten, or eleven children in their families will receive subsidies from the state every year, at 2,000 rubles per child. For children beyond eleven, each child will receive 5,000 rubles. The number of kindergartens will be increased to 300, so that they can accommodate 2.4 million children. Divorce without mutual consent is prohibited. The purpose of the new legal system is to increase the Russian population to 300 million within 25 years. According to the latest population survey, the total number is only slightly more than 162 million.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we often see that Germany and Italy are also working hard to encourage childbirth. The government also gives special subsidies to women who have many children and uses various methods of commendation. At the same time, those men and women who have reached adulthood and have not yet married, or who divorce easily, or who have abortions at will, are punished.</p>
<p>Judging from the fact of encouraging childbirth, it seems that the world is very prosperous, and there is a need for more people to engage in production and work. It is not at all like there is a situation of "overpopulation" or "oversupply of labor." However, if we look at it from another perspective, we see the panic of unemployment everywhere, the overpopulation, and countless people who are displaced and die from famine and poverty every year. Comparing the birth rate and the death rate, the total population of the world is probably not only not increasing, but is actually decreasing day by day. Isn't this a very contradictory phenomenon? On the one hand, we are trying to encourage childbirth, and on the other hand, we are letting people be displaced and die. Rather than increasing reproduction on the one hand, it is better to find ways to reduce irregular deaths!</p>
<p>Due to Malthus's population law, many people who do not understand the laws of society, seeing that the laboring masses have many children and cannot afford to raise them, have come up with many theories of birth control, such as Mrs. Sanger. They believe that the reason why poor families cannot raise children is because they produce at will without restraint. Reproduction should be based on one's own economic conditions. That is to say, rich people can produce more and more because they have the power to support them; poor people should practice birth control, or it is best not to have children at all. Conversely, they also regard the proliferation of reproduction and the lack of birth control as the reason for not being able to support themselves, believing that control is the fundamental remedy. But what is the reality?</p>
<p>Let's see that the intention of Germany and Italy to encourage childbirth is to prepare for another world war. Because the experience of the First World War told them that countless imports need to be consumed in the war, and a continuous supply of population is needed. This is just like the need for a large number of shells and military supplies in the war. Therefore, their encouragement of reproduction is not for the people themselves, but for the preparation for aggression against weak nations and future wars, and preparing to rush to build a large number of flesh bombs. However, in fact, capitalism has developed to the current stage, which will only create unemployment and create wars, and it will never allow the population to increase naturally. It only reduces the import and destroys the population.</p>
<p>But the situation in the Soviet Union is slightly different. Judging from the situation of its domestic production, it seems that only the rise of productivity, the improvement of the living standards of workers, and the disappearance of the unemployed are seen, and because of the rapid progress of industrial production, a large number of laborers are needed. Therefore, its encouragement of reproduction is for economic development, which is the result of economic development.</p>
<p>Originally, the population problem is not simply a biological problem, but also a sociological problem. Under what economic system, there will be what kind of population law. It is by no means solvable by birth control, nor is it solvable by encouraging reproduction for other purposes without following the economic production situation. Rationalization of childbirth can only be achieved in a rational economic life.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Charcoal Kiln <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Charcoal Worker</p>
<p>Communication from Changhua County, Zhejiang</p>
<p>Since charcoal-fueled cars have been speeding along our inland highways, our countrymen have gradually begun to pay attention to the areas where charcoal is produced. Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces are inherently mountainous and have made significant progress in road construction, so public buses running on the highways use a large amount of charcoal as fuel. The Changhua charcoal kilns described in this article, along with the neighboring area of Yuqian, are places with very high production volume.</p>
<p>Changhua County seat is located in the western part of Zhejiang Province, accessible by car directly from the provincial capital Hangzhou, a distance of 132 kilometers. The county is a mountainous area with little farmland. The customs of the people are hardworking and simple, and their lives are rudimentary. Farmers can only rely on the land along mountain streams for cultivation, so the yield of rice is not even sufficient for the food needs of the county. The wasteland is scattered and fragmented, making cultivation difficult. Thus, they mostly develop the mountains, and therefore farmers rely solely on collecting firewood and planting in the mountains as their only way out. Moreover, the mountain soil contains sand, and the forests and fruit trees are densely and luxuriantly layered. Among them, the raw materials for charcoal are undeniably abundant. On the mountains along the highway, pine and fir trees are the most numerous, followed by oak, maple, crape myrtle, cypress, yellow cedar, silk trees, etc. The best raw material for charcoal is oak, followed by maple and other miscellaneous trees, then pine trees. However, the combustion effect after the charcoal is made has its own merits.</p>
<p>Oak trees are divided into white oak, green oak, red oak, and sawleaf oak, collectively known as sawleaf oak. Among them, white oak is the best. White oak comes in large and small sizes, and the charcoal produced is called large and small Wugang charcoal. White oak is strong and heavy. When struck, it produces a metallic sound, and it sinks in water. The best charcoal is one with fine cracks in the core. Its firepower during combustion is double that of pine charcoal, so its price is also the highest. Wugang charcoal was invented by people from Quzhou and is only fourteen years old. Production is quite abundant. Huizhou and Ruichang also have high output. However, because the sales of Wugang charcoal are limited in Changhua County, its annual production only accounts for one-tenth of the total charcoal production. Green oak is called large and small green leaves. Large green leaves are stronger and heavier than small green leaves, and are the best among green charcoal. Its combustion performance is slightly inferior to Wugang charcoal, and the selling price is also slightly lower than Wugang charcoal. However, charcoal sellers do not have separate names for large and small green leaf charcoal, and they are collectively referred to as green charcoal. Red oak is the most common among oaks. There is no name for red oak charcoal. It is mostly mixed with green charcoal and miscellaneous charcoal for sale. As for the raw materials for miscellaneous charcoal, there are many varieties, such as charcoal made from yellow cedar, silk tree, maple, crape myrtle, cypress, and other trees, all of which belong to it, collectively referred to as miscellaneous charcoal. However, they are generally distinguished as large and small miscellaneous charcoal. Because the raw materials for large miscellaneous charcoal are thick and difficult to make charcoal, the kiln fire is too strong, and the charcoal becomes a block, so it is also called "rough chunk". Also, because the nature of miscellaneous trees is light and not strong, after the charcoal is made, it burns and explodes, and floats in water. It is commonly called "exploding charcoal" or "floating charcoal", and its sales are not as wide as small miscellaneous charcoal. The raw materials for small miscellaneous charcoal are selected from the best maple, silk tree, green firewood tree, etc., among miscellaneous trees. The charcoal body is thin and long, and can be used as green charcoal, so its sales are also the largest. Miscellaneous charcoal accounts for seven-tenths of the total annual production and sales. However, its selling price is calculated based on the weight of the charcoal, and is not divided into expensive or cheap due to the size of the charcoal. In the raw materials of pine charcoal, there is also cypress mixed in. Although pine charcoal also has large and small distinctions, its nature is the same. Pine charcoal is loose and easy to burn, with fierce flames, and short burning time, so it has no endurance. When cooking food, it is easily burned. It is rarely used in homes, and is mostly purchased by furnace workshops, cake shops, and tin shops. In recent years, the number of stores using pine charcoal has decreased due to business decline, so the production and consumption of pine charcoal only accounts for two-tenths of the total charcoal production.</p>
<p>When charcoal is sold in the market, there are seven common names: high-hat white oak charcoal (i.e., Wugang charcoal), flat-basket miscellaneous charcoal, high-hat green oak charcoal, round-bottom miscellaneous charcoal, small-basket miscellaneous charcoal, large-basket pine charcoal, small-basket pine charcoal, etc.</p>
<p>It takes three and a half days to burn charcoal once, and 640 catties of charcoal can be produced. With six workers, each worker gets 40 cents, for a total of $2.40 per day. For three and a half days, the total labor cost is $8.40, equivalent to 1.3 li per catty of charcoal. Each dan (small miscellaneous charcoal is 32 catties per dan) costs 41.6 cents, plus the cost of strolling, loading baskets, carrying, and transportation.</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>, totaling 20 cents, the total cost per dan is 71.6 cents, while the current selling price is only 50 cents per dan, a net loss of 21.6 cents.</p>
<p>Charcoal kilns are built jointly with funds raised by charcoal merchants, and the kiln workers are hired on a temporary basis. This type of small-scale capital business only requires 500 yuan of capital to set up a kiln independently. However, to set up a charcoal kiln, you must first find a suitable charcoal mountain location and sign a lease with the mountain owner. The rent for the charcoal mountain is not expensive. Within a radius of ten li, the rent for the charcoal mountain is only 70 to 100 yuan at most. However, when the mountain owner signs a contract with the charcoal merchant, the mountain owner can demand that all ancient fruit trees and timber trees on the mountain be restricted from being cut or damaged. This is mostly accepted by charcoal merchants, because cutting down large trees requires large wages and takes time. Moreover, the tree trunks with a diameter of 2.5 to 3 inches are the best raw material for charcoal. The trunk should be thin, and the nature should be strong and resilient. Large trees are not easy to refine, and after the charcoal is made, it is not durable. Therefore, charcoal merchants do not pay attention to this type of wood. As for the rent of the mountain land, although the rent value is determined by the distance from the water source on the charcoal mountain, the charcoal sales have been sluggish in recent years, and the mountain owners of charcoal mountains that are too far from the water source are even willing not to collect rent in order to attract charcoal merchants to set up kilns and burn. This is because once the trees are cut down, the mountain owner can change to planting six grains. Therefore, renting a mountain to set up a kiln is beneficial to both parties. Now the mountain owners have more active methods, building their own charcoal kilns so that charcoal merchants can purchase materials and burn them at any time. However, at least 100 dan of charcoal must be refined. The mountain owner's profit is calculated at 5 cents per dan. Therefore, the value of charcoal raw materials and land rent is very small. The most important thing is labor costs.</p>
<p>As for the number of charcoal kilns, Changhua County has four districts, originally divided into twelve villages. Since the second village was merged into the third village and the sixth village was merged into the seventh village, there are only ten villages in total. Except for the southern district, which is separated by a water line, the other three districts are all high mountains and forests, and charcoal raw materials can be picked up everywhere. Among them, the first, third, and twelfth villages produce the most charcoal, and the charcoal kilns are also the most numerous in these three places. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, there were more than 340 charcoal kilns, more than 160 in the 21st year, more than 130 in the 22nd year, and only more than 110 in the 23rd year. According to charcoal merchants, there may not even be 40 this year. The decline of the charcoal industry is even clearer from this.</p>
<p>Building a kiln must produce at least 500 dan of charcoal in order not to lose the estimated cost, and the kiln workers are unwilling to do back work. At the beginning of building a kiln, trees are first cut down to prepare for the construction of workers' houses and kiln pavilions, and then branch roads are opened up so that the felled tree branches can be pushed down these branch roads to the kiln side. Therefore, branch roads must be connected to the kiln base. After the branch roads are opened up, trees are felled on one side and charcoal kilns are built on the other. The main material for charcoal kilns is yellow mud, and wood is only used for building kiln pavilions. Each kiln takes about 20 days to complete, costing 70 to 80 yuan. However, in addition to wages, workers building kilns must also be given alcohol money. The shape of the charcoal kiln varies from place to place, with square and round shapes, while Changhua County is famous for its crucian carp back style. Most of the kiln workers are from Jinyun, and the most famous are from Quzhou. The quality of the charcoal depends entirely on the sophistication of the charcoal kiln's construction method, so the charcoal kiln is highly valued by charcoal merchants.</p>
<p>To make charcoal, all tree trunks or branches are first cut into lengths of two feet or more, and dried in the sun for three or four days. When the tree sap penetrates into the center, they can be pushed into the kiln for burning. When the raw material is burned one step, white smoke will come out of the two Tianmu holes set up on the kiln back of this step. When there is no white smoke, it is known that the raw material has been burned, and the two Tianmu holes are covered with mud. When all six Tianmu holes are closed, the raw material has been completely burned. This takes 24 hours of fire work, and the kiln must be sealed for half a day. When the remaining flames are about to die out, the charcoal door is opened one by one, and the charcoal is pulled out, and the remaining fire is quenched with charcoal shavings and charcoal sand. After another six hours, it can be loaded into the charcoal baskets. The work on the kiln takes three days before and after, and 20 dan of small basket charcoal can be produced. Each dan of small basket charcoal is calculated at 32 catties, for a total of 640 catties of charcoal, and the raw materials used are 4,200 catties. The remaining charcoal shavings should be dragged clean as much as possible so that the fire in the kiln can easily dissipate before the second charcoal making. The time between the two makings should be at least one day, so making charcoal is most suitable in spring and autumn.</p>
<p>Most of the kiln workers come from Yanzhou, Chuzhou, Taizhou, and Wenzhou. Workers from this county only account for three-tenths. As for the total number of workers, because the number of kilns is uncertain, it is not possible to investigate in detail. The most at one time was 1,900 people; the least was 1,300 people. Although there are kiln workers, knife workers, and carrying workers at the kiln, these three jobs and the kiln boss all take turns working by day, and their wages are equal. Before the 20th year of the Republic of China, the normal wage was one yuan per worker, and in the 21st year, it was still 60 to 70 cents, but now it is only 30 to 50 cents. However, the wages for carrying charcoal out of the water are still determined by hiring people at any time depending on the distance from the water source. The output is mostly transported by charcoal merchants hiring boats.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Re-Performance of Classical Drama <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Zicong</p>
<p>Recently, the Chinese spoken drama movement seems to be more active. The factual manifestation is that recently not only have many new drama troupes been established, but also many famous dramas have been publicly performed. However, on the whole, most of the dramas performed recently that have attracted attention are famous ancient dramas, and very few new plays produced by modern China. For example, "Nora," "The Government Inspector," "La Dame aux Camélias," and the plays of Chekhov and Ostrovsky that are said to be publicly performed soon can all be said to be classical things. This has aroused discussions among some mechanically-minded people. As soon as their eyes see the word "ancient," their minds immediately think of the current retrograde restoration movement in China, saying: The current flourishing performance of classical dramas in China is a manifestation of the Chinese drama movement converging with the current entire restoration wave; the so-called new drama movement is already retreating! In fact? The problem is not that simple.</p>
<p>We know that before humanity has evolved into a kingdom of freedom, the lives of people in each era and society, although essentially different, have similarities in some places. Therefore, art that reflects human life, although subject to the constraints of the era and society, is possible for people in society to borrow artistic works produced in other eras and societies for the needs of real life. Under this possibility, there have been many revivals or reuse of artistic works from past eras in history. But this revival or reuse is not necessarily a manifestation of restoration or regression; the problem must be judged by the ideological content of the revived or reused art: If the revived or reused art is combined with the retrograde thought of the time, then the significance of this revival or reuse is regression; conversely, if it coincides with the progressive thought of the time at a certain point and has the function of promoting social progress, then it has progressive significance. Therefore, we cannot condemn the revival or reuse of art from past eras as restoration or regression without distinction. For example, the Renaissance can be said that the entire era of literary and cultural movement was reviving the ancient spirit, but we cannot say that the Renaissance movement was regressive; because this movement was used by the emerging citizens to break the darkness of the Middle Ages, and it was their expression of starting to create modern culture, which has new progressive significance. Drama is a field of art. For the revival or re-performance of dramas from past eras, of course, it is also necessary to evaluate it based on the ideological content of the revived or re-performed dramas, and cannot be generally condemned as restoration or regression.</p>
<p>Based on the above principles, we can more concretely talk about the several classical dramas that have been performed in China recently. For example, "Nora" and "The Government Inspector," which are familiar to everyone, although they are old dramas from the 19th century, their performance in China has very new significance: "Nora" opposes old morality, law, and religion, and "The Government Inspector" satirizes old bureaucrats. Every Chinese person who sees it can think of the situation in China and generate new thoughts, feelings, and even new actions. In this way, if we generalize that all the classical dramas performed in China contain a restorative flavor, it is not only a mechanical formal statement, but objectively it is mixing old and new ideas together, making people unable to see clearly and hindering everyone's progress.</p>
<p>Naturally, the recent popularity of classical drama performances in China is not accidental, and it is indeed related to the current restorative trend; but this relationship is not "positive" but "negative." In our opinion, under the current restorative trend, nothing can be discussed except "archaeology," "restoration," and "using the ancient to negate the present," so the new great plays that are urgently needed by the objective reality simply cannot be produced, and even if they are produced, there is no possibility of public performance? Therefore, drama activists have to work hard to find in the old paper piles of foreign countries, to find the great classical dramas that coincide with new ideas at a certain point to perform. If we want to say that the current re-performance of classical dramas in China is related to the current restorative trend, then this is the relationship; therefore, we cannot interpret these two words "relationship" as "convergence," saying that this phenomenon itself is restoration.</p>
<p>In addition, re-performing great classical dramas that have shown the truth of a certain era has great significance in the development of art history. This is also undeniable.</p>
<p>However, precisely because the significance of re-performed classical dramas is mainly to be judged by their ideological content, we cannot unconditionally say that as long as it is a classical drama, it is good, and move a classical drama to the stage when we see one. Because in classical dramas, there are also some hypocritical, decadent, and regressive drugs. If those old drugs are moved to the new stage, they will spread their toxic qualities to the audience. We should stand on the position of reality and choose the classical plays with progressive significance that are needed by China today to perform.</p>
<p>In the current situation in China, such as Ostrovsky's "Poverty is No Crime," Ibsen's "Pillars of Society," "An Enemy of the People," and even Goethe's "Faust," Hauptmann's "Before Sunrise," "The Weavers," etc., in a conditional way, coincide with China's realistic needs at a certain point and can be re-performed. In addition, classical dramas about national liberation are even more urgently needed by China today. Drama activists should work hard to find such plays; if they cannot find suitable ones, they should compile them with historical or realistic themes. I think that the Peking opera compiled and performed by Qilin Tong: "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty" is quite meaningful; if someone can use the historical facts of Wu Sangui colluding with the Qing army to enter the pass as a theme and compile a new spoken drama, the significance will undoubtedly be greater. As for things like "La Dame aux Camélias" that lack positive significance, I think it is better not to perform them.</p>
<p>Secondly, special attention should be paid to the performance. Our re-performance of classical dramas cannot mechanically treat them as classical things and move them to the stage; but should stand on the position of reality and perform them critically and realistically. Recently, the Japanese New Cooperative Theater performed "Faust." The translator of the play, Mr. Kubo Sakae, attempted: "To re-examine classical literature with a realistic Italian method, and to give the poet Goethe a modern evaluation." He said: "Faust and Mephistopheles are not an abstract contrast between good and evil, but express two different forms of resistance to feudal society through the dramatic behavior of these two people" (see the 18th issue of "Study Abroad News"). From this, they have worked hard to make the performance of "Faust" have great practical significance. I think that all performances of classical dramas with new significance should work hard on this point. When necessary, we can even considerably change some scenes, situations, and dialogues in the play, and even place names and personal names, to make it more suitable for the current situation and needs of China, to strengthen its practical significance and value; naturally, this change must be carried out without harming the original meaning of the work and its artistic value. We also oppose changing great classical plays indiscriminately in the name of "practical significance," making them vulgar things to insult the author and fool the audience!</p>
