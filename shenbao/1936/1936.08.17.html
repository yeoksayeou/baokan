<h3 id="c13">美國的和平外交 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>美國在外交方面。自從為九國公約向日本提出了抗議。收不到什麽效果以後。對於國際侵略主義暴力主義的發展。就守着極端的沉默。從表面看來。似乎美國重返到門羅主義。對于歐亞的局勢不問不聞了。其實這樣的消極形態里。還隱藏着積極的性質。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統最近在紐的州恰托瓜夏季會議。就外交政策。作了一次動人的演說。他說。『對于國際世界的狀况。較之美國內國最近的前途。更為關切而少愉快。』可知美國是極端關心着它在全世界投資上貿易上的一切利益的。他又把美國維持世界和平的努力。陳述了一番。很痛切地說到美國所以暫時不管國際間破壞和平的事件。就因為要消弭各國的戰爭。實在不是美國的能力之所能及的了。</p>
<p>要對美國外交政策上的消極形態。更認識得明白些。可以把美政論家哈里斯的一番話來引用一下。他雖是專就遠東問題而說的。可是從這方面也就可以領略美國整個外交政策的眞諦了。據哈里斯說。『過去美國的抗議。所以沒有使日本人留下什麽印象來。就因為美國的海軍力量還只够保護夏威夷羣島。及不到日本的海岸。只有擴充了海軍的實力。直到美國佔有海上的優勢的時候。才可以使美國外交上所要抗議的事伴不至于發生。』</p>
<p>現在美國所採取的政策。顯然就是哈里斯的主張。文遜的大造艦案已經在實施了。據最近電訊。美國决定在三個月內造驅逐艦十二艘。潛水艦六艘。並且在夏威夷眞珠港建起一個大船塢來。</p>
<p>這一種海軍擴張的事實。也同蘇聯的遠束增防之于日本陸軍一樣。使日本海軍不得不以加速度來擴張。日本海陸軍的過度擴張。已經形成了國內的經濟危機。而且還要使這危機加深起來。在經濟危機沒有引起了日本對于世界和平的覺悟以前。日本的統治者是無疑地要用狠辣的手段。加緊對我國的積極行動的。</p>
<p>首當其衝的我們在維持世界和平這一點。當然跟美國取着同一的態度。我們應當把自身僅有的力量。完全匯注到世界和平勢力的主流里去。這才可以使國際暴力主義者的理智和良心重新來支配他們的野心。</p>

<p>今者旣有一成功之藥方，加工特製，以治腎臟症與膀胱症。而且各大藥房，均有出售。君固不需多受一日之苦累矣。</p>
<p>醫師及科學家云。吾人腎臟共有九百萬纖細小管或濾淸器。必須時時工作，日夜不息。以淸除血中之酸質，病素，毒質，菌類，及老廢物。否則身體勢必徐徐受毒。君乃感覺不適。蓋每一小時，血液須在兩腎循環二百决之多。如腎鱗及膀胱失司。則君必覺得未老先衰。於是倦憊衰頹，神志不寗。而患夜便頻數。風濕骨痛，與其他種種病症矣。倘因腎病淋濁症或膀胱衰弱症而患有劇烈之病象。例如體弱無力，夜便頻數，背痛，腿痛，神志不寗，腰痛，四肢倔僵，腦經痛，坐骨神經痛，風濕骨痛，頭且暈眩，目下黑暈，頭痛，不時傷風，周身灼熱，　痛，奇癢或多酸素。君殊不應任意延宕，聽其自然。宜卽開始服醫師之藥方名「施斯德」補腎藥丸者。其足輔助天然之力矯正此種疾症之如何迅速。君可自家證知之。</p>
<p>「施斯德」補腎藥丸，並非一種試騐品。而為醫師之發明品。作用迅速可靠。歷經全球億萬病案之試騐證明。而醫師推許之老。日必千萬。例如英國倫教戡信登理學士，洛司太理醫學博士嘗發表文字云，」一施斯德」為吾多年來從事醫務所見之最精藥品之一。凡屬心地　止之醫師。應卽用以治許多普通腎　病及膀胱症。「施斯德」功能抵抗酸素過多。能於最短時間內，减輕不舒之苦。能澄淸腎臟與膀胱。藥性安全無害。」「施斯德」乃具有四十年經騐之醫師所發明。加工特製，專佻醫治腎臟及膀胱諸症之用。一刻鐘內，藥力卽便開始，以振奮，安慰，及治療寒濕作痛之腎臟及膀胱。令患者在四十八小時內，獲有健適生力，返老還童之新感覺。全球醫師莫不稱道「施斯德」之功績。例如倫敦著名醫科專家「司徒班息」最近發表下列之書面聲明云。「血中提出之毒質。每積聚於腎臟。必須卽速加以排除。否則發炎而使體系困倦。余覺「施斯德」為此利藥方中最可　者之一。余於需用此藥時，均極力推許之」</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>浙閩贛皖四省邊區，大小凡三四十縣，在過去的四五年中，曾被僞「贛浙閩省蘇維埃政府」方志敏部，把它們濃濃淡淡地渲染成一片紅色。自國軍五次圍勦，硬把朱毛驅逐出所謂「中央赤區」的老巢以後，這四省邊區各縣的重要城鎭，也才相繼先後克復，一般注意勦匪問題的視綫，大多數只集中於朱毛主力，西竄川黔，北襲陝晋的情報，而這四省邊區的殘匪的活動，以及淸勦的成效，好像落陽餘暉，刹那間便不足顧了。</p>
<p>可是在事實上，却未許這樣的樂觀，從表面看，所謂「淸勦　匪一，比較進勦主力，似乎是輕而易舉，馬　功成的事，實際上却因殘匪都是地方土著，非常熟習地形及民情；散則為民，聚則為寇，抗戰能力固然薄弱，但活動的能力，以較主力還要强，負有淸勦這批殘匪任務的軍隊，因為他們（即殘匪）出沒不定，聚散無常，兵數去多了尋不着目標，去少了又常遭遇意外的附算，這裏有個比喻：殺鷄當然無須乎用牛刀，但是假設這鷄不是隻馴服待殺的塒鷄，而是于一隻　飛帶跳的野鷄，那麼此時　不僅鷄刀」無法下手，就連牛刀也將無　施技了，從而知目前各地淸勦殘匪的軍事，保安隊力量來不及，更益之以部分的國軍，而且經過了相當的時間，可是對於神出鬼沒的殘匪實力，還依然未損其毫髮，這事象的外在原因，到與上述殺鷄故事很相像。</p>
<p>以浙南匪情來說吧：自國軍把方志敏部主力擊潰，同時還將贛南勦匪勝利軍第十八軍調來駐防，冷冷熱熱的勦匪軍事，畢竟不曾間斷過，此次兩廣異動，國軍調往應付，更給予殘匪一個「老貓不在家，鼠兒打鞦韆」的機會，於是他們便蠢蠢欲動，以作餘燼復熾之計，最顯著的例證，就是開化縣城，上月剛一度失陷，本月初，各鄉又再被洗刦，匪現佔據大龍山，組織縣蘇維埃紋府；幷有與他股謀取聯絡，而進窺常山·遂安·衢縣·各地的企圖，當開化失陷的前夕，江山接到峡口（距江由城的六十里）電話，僅說閩北竄來匪衆三股，每股數十人，按路向是想會攻峽口，不料翌晨警聲傳來，却是匪衆五百，攻陷開化，俟第二次洗刦開化各大村莊，據報：「匪衆增至二千餘，匪化農民　達三萬人，保安隊鉑短防綫，保守縣城，」匪衆用兵的奇突，赤化手段的厲害，有如此者。</p>
<p>年來流竄浙南的殘匪，追溯起他們的小史，似乎也是「來頭不小」的，當僞第七軍團被擊破後，一部份便入浙改編為僞獨立師，前七軍團參謀長栗裕任師長，前政委劉英仍任政委，　近又加上個剃頭匠出身的黃立貴，他們都是名馳三省的匪首，該僞獨立師組織實力，分為五個縱隊，每縱隊分三個支隊，每支隊分三班，每班人數七八個，每縱隊的有人數一二百，步槍百餘枝，輕重機關槍及駁壳槍各一二架，此外還有農工游擊隊等組織，人數不易計其確實，他們活動的區域，不外閩浙贛的邊境各縣，單以浙南範圍說，却是開化·遂安·常山·龍游·江山等縣，有時也會波及到麗水一帶去的，翻開各地報紙看，有時會發現同一匪首，同一時日，而在不同的鄰省，大事洗刦的新聞，這幷不是報紙的誤載，而是匪踪飄忽，行動詭秘，而令人難於捉摸的原故。</p>
<p>匪軍的戰術，是述用游擊戰術，乘弱搗虛，不與國軍打硬戰，常用少數的匪衆，來牽制多數的兵力行動，例如把游擊隊放在大軍堡壘附近來活動，把大的兵力調往遠近後方去活動，總不與軍隊作正面的接觸，偵探每到一處，就建立交通站及工作網諜報網等，與他方面的關係和接濟，從前還有無綫電互通消息，後來却被軍隊圍繳去了，他們的經濟來源，平時全靠「打土豪和」綁活財神」來維持，匪首如劉英·黃立貴·等身邊，隨時都携帶着巨額的鈔洋，匪兵如積有多金，却須繳呈政委，否則認為反動，予以嚴重處分，他們的困難很多，連食糧冬衣，都常成問題，傷兵沒有醫院，只好藏在老白姓家裏去醫，　品有的是向藥房直接購買（衢縣某大西藥房老闆，曾因販賣此項藥品案發被殺，）有的是責令土豪，以贖票代價，買了送去，最感缺乏的要算彈十藥，故他們對於彈藥的攫取，往往不惜重大犧牲，不久的以前，某師有運輸汽車九輛，由江山開往閱北蒲城，被匪軍偵悉第九輛滿載彈藥，預於某橋施工埋伏，俟前行八輛通過，橋標忽頹然斷落，餘一輛所載彈藥，因全被卸運上山，此外還另有武器的來路，可是多與他方面的大雅有關，恕不一一細述了。</p>
<p>他們赤化人民的方法，每到一地，遇有現成的團體分子，如保甲·學校·及靑帮等，便利用他們去誘致民衆，或直接調查人口，召集民衆開會，利用民衆的生活痛苦，吿訴他們去打土豪分田地，幷揚言如不願參加赤色活動的，將來便不分給他田地，農民以田地為生命，有的自然樂意參加，尤其一般紙工罷工，因九一八事變，把他們的出產品紙張及夏布的大銷塲東北，輕輕地斷送給敵人，因而各該業相繼停歇，使他們大批的失業，淪於困頓生活中，大家正滿懷悲憤，一籌莫　的時候，突聞共黨提出反帝抗×的口號，自然更容易打動了他們的心弦，萬一還有遲疑不决的農戶，也要把壯丁姓名開列，强迫編人游擊隊，不去工作的，就以反動罪名處死，如此利誘威迫，黨羽還愁不日集日多？</p>
<p>有一位從閩北來的朋友吳覺非君，他曾任閩北某師特別黨部助理員，兼駐閩第一綏靖區政和縣保　整訓指導員，官銜雖不大，但他的職務，是介於官府與收復區民衆之間，所以他曾談了關終這方面的幾點實際材料，記者認為是很可寳貴的，</p>
<p>吳君說，問北殘匪的不易繳絕，主因幷不在於匪方，而是在於官方，蓋若政治不淸明，官廳不廉潔，那麼「滔滔皆是也」的殘匪，也將無澈底肅淸之一日，目前從事政治工作者，不轉法幣念頭的，能有幾人？卽果有其人，但也難保不被惡劣的環境，把他拉了「下海」，以縣長來說，倘不與土劣取得合作，一來怕他們尋隙生事，用五分郵票，就可告至上司，縱不撤差，也要脫毛，二來辦事也不順利，如遇軍隊開差，着縣長徵派夫役，縣畏素日不與土劣關係　好，此　必將束手無策，反之，若與土劣關係弄好，此刻他們便會替你墊欺僱夫，使你安享其成，不過事後他們向老百姓派欵償補或多或少，你只好裝　作啞，可是老百姓却該死了，</p>
<p>他又說：閩北的老百姓，眞　極窮了，我（吳君自稱）到各地去指導組織保甲訓練壯丁時，奉上峯命令，各該組織所需經費，是向人民隨地微收，每戶二角，赤貧者免，可是收復區及鄰匪區的老百姓，同是飢餓羣中人，誰非赤貧，如何鑒別得出，要免牧，便得大家免收，但皇皇上命，經費又無從籌措，不得巳只好收着看，有一家竟把預備給產婦吃的鷄蛋，送來六枚，請作微費二角的代價，（按徵收處收到此項代替品，若把牠撥歸伙食開支項下，來做菜吃，不知怎樣下噎？）更有些僻遠的鄉鎭，反抗雜捐雜稅，幷羣起而撲殺徵收員，官廳當然未便置諸不理，如此，便常造成意外的社會變態，「老百姓非常的怕公務員，而公務員也非常的怕老百姓，」這眞呌千古未有的奇事，我們試把這些不幸的事象，按照幾何學算法，幷引用「官逼民變」和「民窮為寇」的定理，推算其結果，那麼這殘匪能否肅淸的問題，便可以得到適當的解答了，</p>
<p>央君這一席話，可稱「經騐之談」，亦可謂為「由衷之言」，這雖是指閩北而言，但近水樓台的浙南，各種情形，也大致差不多，故敢借花獻佛，歸納吳君談話，來做本文結論，「官廳少剝削，民衆負擔輕，而且一般勤勞大衆，都有生路可走，如是殘匪才易澈底肅淸。」</p>

<p>— Coustan　ceColine作　月祺譯</p>
<p>（帶奧干尼斯是古希臘一個哲學家，常常提着燈籠在街頭尋求眞理。——譯者註）</p>
<p>新近我到過羅馬，在那里探訪了雨星期之久，要想我出一個能够理解什麼而不存私心的法西斯黨員來。可是我連只要碰到一個的運氣，竟也是沒有。</p>
<p>我看到過許多熱心的法西斯主義擁護者。他們是缺乏腦筋的實行家，每天從報紙上面攝取精神的營養。這些「中堅分子」滿意於誇大的言辭而缺乏對於使現代危險化的政治問題與經濟問題的判斷力，口口聲聲說着「我們是眞實的，高尙的，聰明的，並且勇敢的」。他們祖成一個階級，這階級似乎存在於任何國家，裏面包括着貴族，布爾喬，和平民。與其說牠是一個社會階級，不如說牠是一個才智階級；用觀相學的術語來說，我們可以說牠是屬於「肌肉型」的。</p>
<p>我也碰到過主義在者，他們對我解說：法西斯主義把一切黨派融化在熔爐中，使牠們合成一黨；他們說：誰都不顧他自己的私人利益而獻身於公衆利益；他們說：不論在城市或在鄉村，誰都覺得快樂；他們又說：卽使有貧困的人，他也不至於因貧困受苦，因為他的「理想」解除了他的煩惱。我應該承認，這些主義在者確實使我顚倒，確實使我相信他們的話。不幸，我所碰到的種種事實却證明着：雖然他們都是眞誠的，忠實的和信服主義的人，但他們的話却絲毫都靠不住，因為他們已被他們的信仰昏迷得失却任何辨識能力了。</p>
<p>其决，我又覺到在那裏搜索眞理輒使人老大失望，因為當我們從事這樣搜索的時候，我們會認知：人的許多最高尙的幻像是以錯誤的解釋為根據的。</p>
<p>例如：</p>
<p>義狂者說：「人民把結婚戒指和金飾捐贈祖國的時候所表示的然情完全出於眞誠，而月實在動人」。</p>
<p>事實的證據證明着：在舉行這儀式的日期以前幾天，偽飾商人因販賣假造的結婚戒指發了一筆大財。</p>
<p>僑居國外的意大利公民都接到從本國寄來的個別的價件，訓令他們把他們的金飾送到附近的領事館去。</p>
<p>許多意大人對我說，他們捐贈結婚戒指，完全由於恐懼，因為假如違抗命令他們就要受累的。</p>
<p>一個主義在者說：凡是眞芷愛慕主義者，黨都允許：他們量力捐助。注重的不是他們的金錢而是他們的信仰。</p>
<p>事實的證據證明着：一個無丈夫無兩親的窮苦婦人跑到黨部裏去更換她的黨證。「你有否把你的結婚戒指捐贈祖國？」他們問她。「我沒有結婚戒指。」「那麼你的首飾，或你的堅信十字架？」「我沒有首飾，也沒有堅信十字架。我是什麼都沒有的。」「那麼，你得繳付一百里拉，比平常多繳八十里拉，以代替你應該捐贈的首飾。」</p>
<p>她照數繳付了，因為沒有黨證，她就絕對沒有我尋工作的機會。</p>
<p>一個主義在者說：合作制度的成績大可欽佩。任何工人都受了保障，雇主與工人的利益就一致起來。雇主與受雇者之間的合作終於實現了。</p>
<p>事實的證據證明着：一個土木工程承攬人（法西斯黨員）說：「自從採用合作制度以來，就難得雇用良好工人。他們把工人派送給你，不問這些工人是否精練，不問你對他們是否滿意。」我問，「你是否覺得合作制度在進步着？」他說，「都不過是官樣文章罷了。就大體上可以說，沒有什麼改變，因為革新來一次，規避牠的計畫也就想出一次來。」</p>
<p>一個主義狂者說：任何意大利人都預備為　護主義而死。</p>
<p>事實的證據證明着：預備為打倒主義而死的意大利人，我個人至少認識十個。</p>
<p>在政治舞臺上，我更認識了另一類的然誠擁護主義者。我以為他們的成為法西斯黨員不是由於必需，我又以為，他們不是在故意掩飾他們的情感。我以為愛慕主義和愛慕戀人相同：對於熱愛的根源，誰都易於誤會的。從參加活動的時候起，他們就在心中閉住批評意識和懷疑意識的門戶。</p>
<p>可是，不論他們是怎樣熱誠，怎樣信仰主義，我不能把他們認為「典型的法西斯黨員。」我在這兩星期中所找尋的是一個完全由於他自己的自由意志而贊成主義愛慕主義依附主義的能理解且又不存私心的人。但這樣的法西斯黨員，我終於我不到一個。</p>
<p>現在讓我們轉到法西斯主義的敵人方面去看看吧。我們可以我到各式各樣的法西斯主義敵人，但他們都是不被重視的。固然，在他們之中有最聰明的，最豪俠的，與教育程度最高的意大利人，但這事實並不重要。獨裁制度不需要才智，不需要豪俠，也不需要文化；牠所需要的只是服從。</p>
<p>這些人們不被重視，因為，就階級說，他們是個人主義者。他們沒有組織，他們的意見不一致。他們不適合任何地方，他們不操縱任何動作，但人民怕他們而且避開他們，因為被人家看到與他們在一起是要發生不良的印象的</p>
<p>我們必須明瞭，目前的整個法西斯組織是以秘密通知為基礎的。這一類的通知使人恐懼，恐懼使人服從，幾乎全國一致的奴隸性，就是因此吿成的。我們也必須明瞭，反法西斯主義者持門戶之見的理由，正和主義狂者持門戶之見的理由相同。聽他們說話，你們會想到他們的話都靠不住。他們否認明白的眞理，而且他們常和主義在者同樣煽動着人心。</p>
<p>假如我們回憶到一九二二年意大利的混亂狀態，我們就會明白為什麼必需「幹這一套。」「這一套」巳做了而且做得好。假如他們讓報紙自由接受補助金，自由批評，假如任何懷疑的動作或論綢不被箝制，這「一套」是否會同樣做得好呢？大槪不會同樣做得好吧。</p>
<p>但到了現在，意大利已渡過靑春期的危機，骨架已完成，計畫已準時實現，為什麼要繼續束縛這馴熟的野獸呢？為什麼要創製如戰爭之類算是來為解救人民的新的桎梏呢？為什麼要替人民規定更多更危險的國家主義的目的呢？為什麼要使人民受物貿的犧牲呢？大槪不是為使法西斯主義更重要，也不是為使牠更改良。那麼，為什麼呢？</p>
<p>我不願意斷定這些都為的是保全一人的感勢，但有很多的時候我確不免作如是想。</p>

<p>— 顧惠民</p>
<p>美國洛克弗羅基金團（Rockefellow　Foundation）在中國獎掖教育事業，已有很久的歷史，尤其在醫學與自然科學方面。一九三五年該基金團始有協助農村復興工作的傾向。一九三五年度該團　中國計劃」經費可分五大項，茲列表於下：</p>
<p>一九三五年度在華基金指撥表</p>
<p>（一）華北計劃</p>
<p>中華平民教育促進會　國幣五〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>南開大學經濟硏究院　三七，五〇〇元</p>
<p>燕京大學社會學院與理學院　七七，三二五元</p>
<p>（二）南京公共衛生與醫學計劃</p>
<p>衛生署　國幣八七，五〇〇元</p>
<p>醫學教育委員會　二一，二五〇元</p>
<p>（三）爾京農業計劃</p>
<p>金陵大學農業經濟系與　美金五，五〇〇元</p>
<p>自然科學系　國幣七二，五〇〇元</p>
<p>中央大學農學院（養畜與獸醫）　三四，六〇〇元</p>
<p>農業實騐所（治　工作）　三四，三〇〇元</p>
<p>（四）獎學金　　美金三七，五〇〇元</p>
<p>補助金</p>
<p>補助硏究與發展　美金一〇，〇〇〇元</p>
<p>華北計劃</p>
<p>華北高等學府受基金團津貼者，有天津南開大學與北平燕京大學。定縣牛民教育促進會亦受其資助。</p>
<p>定縣平民教育促進會獲得基金團撥欵國幣一五〇，〇〇〇元。該會努力於復興農村，原為民衆識字運動而設，現已成為教育上實　與硏究之良好組織。這種有計劃的民衆教育運動，非本地財力所能負擔，因之很需要外界的資助。舉凡自治，公安，教育，民生和公共衛生等訓練，都在經濟的簡單的原則之下進行。該會現正從事於村政人員之訓練，俾可擴大這棟試騐到全國。至於基金團之本意，則在協助大學畢業生從事於農村訓練，並硏究復興農村的新方法。</p>
<p>這項合作計劃，自去年七月一日起，開始進行。定縣平教會現設有特殊訓練委員會，就教育，衛生，地方行政，農業，經濟各科設立國內獎學金額三十七名。事實上定縣已成為訓練的實騐中心，試騐區推行到廣西，湖南，廣東，四川，河南，等省。</p>
<p>南開大學經濟硏究院得有基金團撥欵國幣三七，五〇〇元。撥欵目的是在資助該院教學與研究農村復興問題，並使該院得與定縣平教區密切聯絡。南大經濟硏究院已有若干畢業生至定縣續受訓練。該院添設合作學，地政學，地方行政，與地方財政學等課程。已有若干學生與指定各縣受八個月的實習，以為農村行政人員之準備。新添課程中並設有國內獎學金額七名。</p>
<p>燕京大學社會學院與理學院得有基金閣撥欵國幣五八，一二五元，社會學院續得國幣九，二〇〇元，以為農村復興訓練課程發展之用。燕大除繼續辦理醫學預科與看護學預科外，並創設一種新社會科學計劃，其目的在訓練靑年，擔任地方行政，鄕村行政，鄉村教育，農民副業等社會經濟工作。燕大並與南大及定縣平教會合組委員會進行預定計劃，自去年起，燕大新設農村課程，槪由專任教員擔任。</p>
<p>燕大理學院近數年來會受洛氏基金團的援助，現亦趨向農村問題。生物學系注重昆虫學的硏究，化學系則在探討陶器，製革等農村副業。</p>
<p>燕大社會學院三學系新添農村問題課程十一種之多。學生選讀者一百十九人。此外並設有合作學，地方行政等特別硏究班。為實騐起見，該校社會學教授已被任為一個三十萬人口的縣長。經濟政治科畢業生就在該縣實習。一般人對農村問題的興趣，由此可見。</p>
<p>南京公共衛生與醫學計劃</p>
<p>在這項計劃下得受基金團之補助的為衛生署與醫學教育委員會。這種公共衛生的訓練對於中國復興很有關係。</p>
<p>衛生署得有基金團撥欵國幣八七，五〇〇元，大都為訓練醫學衛生人員之用。衛生署在教學方面巳添聘職員，購置器械，並充實各項課程，其中數項特為看護，醫官與衛生視察員而設。獎學金額五十一名，目的是在訓練衛生醫官，看護，衛生，工程師及農村康健工作人員。　（未完）</p>

<p>議决辦法</p>
<p>報吿畢、隨卽開始討論、先後由浙錫滬三地絲廠代表發抒意見、當經議决各案如下、甲。對商檢局辦理生絲品質檢騐、應請求改善之五項辦法、（一）請求商檢局、改良收條式樣、以示愼重、（二）請求加增檢騐效率、（以規定二日檢騐完畢為原則、）以利絲商、（三）關於公量費虛耗問題、請求該局變通申請手續、准絲商先行報騐品質如需補公量費時、然後照出口絲繳費、以免犧牲、（四）請求該局、應准許絲商有請求免費複騐一次之權利、（五）請求局方對檢騐證書、不限定五包為一批、卽十包亦可劃為一批、以免每批有不合七十八公分不准報裝出口之弊、乙。對出口商公會八月五日五項决議案、應付辦法、（一）吾决出口商公會議决自八月五日後、絲廠售絲與出口洋行、所檢騐之絲絞（卽樣條）二十五條、歸出口商所有之主張、（二）在出口商自主檢騐時、每包抽樣一條、現旣改歸政府機關檢騐、出口商自應母庸再行抽樣檢騐、（三）解貨應由廠商直接解交商檢局、認為無先解交出口商之必要、（四）請求商檢局延緩公佈生絲品級檢騐標準曁實行檢騐日期、（按品級於檢騐一層、商檢局已定期明年二月一日實行、本月五日、出口商公會召集大會議决、對此項品級檢騐、督促政府、早日實行、然絲廠業則反對出口商之主張）（五）期貨解貨、至遲應於每月二十六日前送交商檢局檢騐、如遇假期、得延長之、（六）生絲交易取銷向例收欵辦法、俟檢騐完畢、出口商應卽憑公量單、付淸貨欵、以符銀貨兩交原則、並定九月一日起實行、在出口商未表示同意前、暫停解九月份期貨、以上辦法、錄案通知出口商公會查照、迄六時議畢散會、</p>

<p>督促常局嚴厲緝私　月初南旋謁孔報吿</p>
<p>華北走私、自經政府嚴緝以來、雖已不若過去之猖獗、惟私貨屯積、日鮮浪人仍在活動中、茲據新聲社記者探悉、海關總稅務司梅樂和、特於前日乘海關巡艦海星號、離滬北上、分赴華北津秦等口岸視察、督促各該埠海關稅務司、厲行緝政、預定下月初旬南旋、屆時謁孔財長報吿、</p>

<p>華東社云、本年新米、早稻已告登塲、晚稻於一月後、亦可出新、現下各省農業倉庫、已相繼成立、茲誌詳情如决、</p>
<p>農倉完成　農業會庫、經實業部督促各省市、並由前全國經濟委員會合作事業委員會之指導、各省人民之自動努力、迄今三年許、已隨時代之需要而吿完成、綜計江·浙·皖·鄂·贛·諸省、每省統扯每縣有一倉庫、該項倉庫有係省建、有係縣築、亦有人民自動經營、而得經濟金融家之扶助者、迄至目前、已够適用、</p>
<p>深入農村　該項倉庫、均係最新式之建築、在鄉村中固不需要有偉大的建築物、但較農民自建之米倉、當較通風、且適合光度、新陳米糧、存儲時期、的三四年不壞、故頗為農民所信仰、惟間有許多鄕村、有不少土劣、操縱此項新組織、猶如細胞中攙入細菌、農民對之、頗具戒心、</p>
<p>兼營當業　此種倉庫、甚合適於非常時期緊急需要、惟硏究農村經濟者、以為在準備期中、倉庫頗有利用時機、兼營當業之必需、因農民在需要時、可將農具細軟暫典應用、於農忙時低利取贖、並可藉此周轉、作小本副農經濟之流動資金云、</p>
<h3 id="c75">各銀行　辦理米麥運銷貸欵　政府通過救濟運銷辦法　日商收買小麥價格高漲 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>新聲社云、全國產麥區域、今年小麥均吿豐收、依照南京稻麥改進所之的計、產麥四萬萬九千五百萬據、尤以華北各省山東河北等、所產之麥質為最良、麥粒之大、勝於洋麥、產米區域、今年早稻、已吿豐收、早稻晚稻、亦將先後登塲、因天氣調勻、預卜一定亦吿豐收、今行政院據鄂省政府之呈請、對稻麥之運銷、已通過救濟辦法七項、令飭遵辦、</p>
<p>銀行貸款</p>
<p>各銀行凡經營儲蓄者、决定依照儲蓄銀行法第七第八兩條之規定、至少以存欽總額五分之一辦理農業各項貸欵、今各銀行儲蓄存欵總額的六萬萬元、如以五分一計、則為一萬二千萬元、銀行之辦理農業貸欵、以米麥棉為主要農業物、其貸欵辦法、分生產和運銷、今米麥棉生產期將過去、所以如中國·交通·上海·中國農民·金城。等銀行、業已開始辦理米麥運銷貸欵、</p>
<p>日商收買</p>
<p>自日商三牛奪羊行、向我國產麥區域、收買小麥、裝輪運日、供麵粉廠製粉之用後、今仍繼續收買、昨日截止、已裝運出口者、總的三十餘萬擔、小麥價格、因日商之收買而高漲、現貨小麥每包一百斤、已漲至國幣五元、我國政府、對小麥出口問題、已由實業財政兩部會商具體辦法、至於日商收買我國米之說、尙難證實、</p>

<p>所得稅會計制度問題新新社云、昨據沈立人會計師發表吾國徵收所得稅後之會計問題、頗多意見供獻、爰特分誌如次、</p>
<p>會計關係</p>
<p>吾國所得稅、行　於次月初開始徵收矣、按諸國府頒佈之所得稅暫行條例、凡公司商號等營利事業之課稅、以資本與純益之比率為標準、純益之决定、基於損益計算書、損益計算書之教字、來源自一切賬冊、賬冊之記載苟於事實不符、純益之計算必不準備、而徵稅必失其平等之原則、是以各種事業會計制度之優絀、與黴收所得稅有密切之關係、理固顯然、歐美各國所得稅之法規中、對於各業會計制度、大都不加限制、良以各　會計制度、雖非盡善盡　、但因其會計學識之普及、會計人才之衆多、其最大之力量、出於學校及教本、故已多成系統、每一事業、均有統一之會計制度、可供採用、反觀吾國、除銀行鐵路及政府有統一之會計制度外、其他工商企業、除一小部份外、均紊亂無章、毫無系統之可言、當茲所得稅開始徵收之際、各營利事業之當局者、必有二類疑惑不决之問題、一類為其事業雖定有會計制度、但當呈報繳稅時、能否審查合格、發生糾紛、其賬册能否全與事實符合、另一類則大都係獨資營業、或自由職業、一切收支向由業主個人掌管、本無須乎會計制度、今因所得稅之徵收、必須有詳細之賬册、作為塡製所得稅報吿表之根據、勢必設立會計制度、然設立之方法如何、設立後之費用如何、不致驟然增加、均莫由解决</p>
<p>革新制度</p>
<p>嘗考他國會計之發展、奉半由徵收所得稅而推進、故値吾國舉辦此新稅時、亟宜將工商業會計制度、作一系統之革新、其利大則可促進全國實業、小亦可於徵收所得稅時、减少糾紛之發生、故鄙見認為徵收直接稅機關、應延聘對會計富有經騐學識者、組織一會計制度硏究會、內分三組、一為會計科目研究組、一為賬册格式研究組、另一為防弊方法硏究組、吾國現行之會計科目、除銀行鐵路及政府機關、曾加規定外、各種事業、均多自行選用、自行創造、他人閱之、每難知其意義、普通舊式商店、習俗相傳、善以吉利口彩為賬簿名稱、如「以義為利」、以代决算報吿、「豐收」以代銷貨等是、至若新式會計員、因所學者均為英文之教本、（多為美國出厰）、科目名稱、遂多直譯英文、如Accounts　Receiyaqle譯為「應收賬項」、Surplus譯為「盈餘」等是、惟如考其實際、則Accounts　Receivable及Surplus等科目、在英文本身原覺不甚適宜、祗因已成習慣、遂亦沿用之、吾國則未加研究、任意譯用、謬誤更甚、硏究會中應將吾國會計科目、擇其常用者、統其名稱、不得參差、</p>
<p>統一賬冊</p>
<p>各種賬簿之格式、本應隨事業性質之不同而異、但普通基本賬册、如分錄簿·總賬·及現金簿·等、頗有統一之可能、應由研究會中、就主要各業設計、此種帳冊之格式、以　　用、至若進貨銷貨等簿、須依事實之特性而變動者、可由會計師聘受設計之、吾國現狀、舊式商店、多沿用吾國原有帳簿格式、較新式者、或採用過波時期之改良中式簿記制度、或卽改用西式、所謂西式恒為英美制、因目前從事會計工作人員所讀者、都為英文教本、或英文譯本、由各原始簿分別過帳、惟實際所用、亦有根據大陸制者、重於分錄日肥簿、蓋我國會計制度之設立、創於銀行、當時均以日本銀行制度作為藍本、日人所用者為大陸式、職是之故、現代會計課程與實際所用者、每有不同之處、如會計制度研究會得能成立、而能制定各業會計制度、則各種會計數本必重行編製、以求適合法令、防弊方法研究組、專事各種交易之內部牽制之硏究、蓋吾國工商業用人大都不少、祇以缺乏良好之內部牽制組織、遂致舞弊與錯誤無從防止、如略加更動、使能合於牽制原理、則經費無從增加、卽可獲得良好之效果也、</p>
<p>補救辦法</p>
<p>以上所述、為將來對於會計制度之硏究工伴、惟所得稅卽將徵收、故對於目前未有優良會計制度之事業、亟須定一補救之方法、茲再略陳鄭見如下、所謂急需補救之事業、仍可依照前述分為二類、一為巳有會計制度、惟不甚適宜者、一為根本未有會計制度者、前者以工商業為衆、後者則多自由職業、茲先就原有會計制度者而論、其改善之前提有二、一曰不增費用、二曰原有職員不加變動、其改善之方式、可仍依設計原則而行、今述如决、（一）科目名稱、吾國會計科目、以前政府曾頒布譯名一次、惟僅係一小部份、卽可以此為根據、更擇銀行鐵路政府等會計中、巳規定之科目、性質相同者沿用之、其變更時期、以在月終為宣、（二）防弊方法、視察事業所用職工之多少、在可能範圍內、將原有職員分派職務、並規定其責任、務使每項交易、至少須經二人之手、俾得互相牽制、（三）帳册格式、帳册格式、暫行可不必變動、惟須查究交易記錄之有無證據、自各種單據過入簿册、自各簿册過入總帳、其手繼有無錯誤、第三者可否審查、自總帳編製報吿表、是否便利、凡與此數點不合者、宜加改革、至若本無帳簿之事業、則自開徵所得稅日起、應將收支之一切單據保存、另設日記簿一本、將每日交易、分別借貸、記入是簿、此則稍請簿記常識者皆可為之、其他簿冊可暫不設立、更有進者、鄙人認為所得稅徵收機關、對於帳簿應吾採用大陸式、為可硏究之一點、如法意等國之規定、以分錄日記簿為法定簿冊、其他原始簿冊、均為補助日記帳、蓋吾國現有之記帳制度、大都如是、可省更改之勞、於審查帳目時、亦可較為有系也、</p>

<p>— 中國徵主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之卅四）</p>
<p>（一）緒言　中國之有電影事業，至今垂二十年矣。此二十年中，製片廠，經理商，百分之化十皆集中於上海，是以該業在上海一埠之情形，可為全國之代表。中國之電影事業，亦芷與其他各種民族工業相同，二十年夾備受外片之壓迫，至今尙喘息於外片之下，危機重重，難以言喻。其所以留存迄今而仍能有相當發展之希望者，技術之進步，政府之獎勵，實為其主要原因也。</p>
<p>上海之電影業，大別之可分為製片，經理，戲院，三大類，製片廠尙無外資之侵人，其閒雖有數外人圖在滬設廠，然卒以種種關係未獲成功。經理及戲院，則大多為外人所包辦，如美國在滬之八大公司，幾操縱全滬之影片經理事業，而獨佔整個市塲。</p>
<p>本篇擬概述製片及經理之沿革及現狀，而將戲院併入影片市塲節內，今分述於後。</p>
<p>（二）沿草　一九〇年美人布拉士其，在滬組織亞細亞影片公司，攝製「西太后」及「不幸兒」兩片。一九一　年美人依什爾來華遊歷，當時新劇正當興盛時代，依氏乃與新劇界人合作，利用新劇演員服裝佈景，攝製「莊子劈棺」黑籍寃魂三片，但劇情旣不足道，表演技術又復惡劣，所能賣座者，僅在於影戲之新奇耳。該兩公司均於歐戰爆發後閉歇。</p>
<p>一九八年，商務印書　創設影片部，從事攝製教育及風景等短片，此為國人自製影片之嚆矢。翌年有美國環球公司（Universal　Pi　t-nes　Corp.　of　America）來滬製片，冀與商務對抗，一九一二年，股顯輔管海峯等，糾織新亞公司，攝製「紅粉骷髏，」但杜宇等組織上海公司，攝製「海誓，」越年鄭鷓鴣（已故）鄭正秋（已故）張石川，周劍雲，任矜蘋等，組織明星公司，攝製滑稽短片，繼復出「報應昭彰」一片至是中國始有正式之製片公司。</p>
<p>一九二三年，復有大中華，長城，百合，大上海，新中華等公司成立，一九二五年邵醉翁兄弟之天一公司成立，是時影片公司正如雨後春筍，相繼成立者又有神州，友聯，新少年等十七家，同年大中華與百合復合併為大中華百合，至此影片事業已漸趨興盛。一九二六年，商務影片部改組為國光公司，任矜蘋脫離明星，自組新人公司，此外更有民新，華劇等十三家公司成立，此數年中，公司雖多，然此起彼仆，除少數公司外，多數皆不久停閉，或者僅有公司之名義，而無出品者，因此電影界傾軋日盛，而使整個事業入於混亂時代，自電影檢查會成立，各小公司相繼淘汰，一九二九年後該業始入正軌，大中華百合，民新三公司再行合併，於一九三〇年十月十五日正式成立聯華公司，更使電影界一振精神。</p>
<p>此時期中，曾有少數外人，企圖在華設廠製片，如一九二六年英美烟公司曾有投資電影計劃，一九三二年中外合資開設中國第一公司，同年有外人Betly　Conepson企圖創設中外公司，然卒以本國影業界步伐整齊，外資無由伸人，同時政府之侶導，亦與有力焉。</p>
<p>據實業部報吿，至民國二十一年止，上海共有公司三十七家，其中較大者僅明星，聯華，天一三家，目多數公司均因一二八影響已陷停頓，至一十二年所存公司僅十餘家，二十三年藝華成立，二十四年更有電通，新華，玉成等公司創設，本年電通，玉成停業，新創有新華，文化等家，據聯華公司統計，目前上海影片公司共十一家，其中實際製片者七家，此為上海電影製片業之大概。</p>
<p>上海電影業中現有之技術人員，如攝影師，佈景師等，大半均非專家，其能有目前之成績者，均從經騐中得來，其中可述者僅為有聲片之攝製，及明星公司一度嘗試五彩片二事而已。民十八年舶來有聲電影輸入中國，上海各大戲院次第放映，各製片廠羣思開攝聲片，然以成本浩大，人才缺乏，舉辦不易，於是先攝製臘盤配音，如聯華之「野草閒花」，明星之「歌女紅牡丹一，友聯之「虞美人」等，其後又有陳秋風等組織公司赴日攝製「雨過天靑」。民二十天一開攝有聲片「歌塲春色」，至是中國始有片上發昔之有聲電影，明星公司更派洪深教授赴美購置有聲機件，並聘來錄音師二人，攝製「人肉市塲」等片，同時國人發明有聲機者日多，如石世磬之「愛司通」，顏鶴眠之「鶴鳴通」，竺淸賢之「淸賢式」等，至此收音技術始不全賴外人，聲片之攝製，亦山是更獲普遍矣。目前上海之製售有聲機者共有八家，但大半係戲院所用。一九三一年，明星公司鑒於五彩片之流行，將「啼笑姻緣」之一部分攝製五彩，但以技術不精，成本過大，至今無繼起者。明星當局亦已放棄是項企圖。其他如萬氏兄弟發明自製卡通畫片，亦係電影技術上一顯著之進步。</p>
<p>至於外片之輸入，及競爭，亦有一述之必要。外片自一九〇四年來滬，頗獲滬上人士歡迎，西班牙人雷馬斯首在滬開設Rosam'　Vo　toria，（現改新中央）戲院，又設夏令配克，愛普羅等，是時極本無國產影片，不但所映全係外片，所有電影院亦全由外人開設，其後明星公司成立，國產片問世，乃組織中央公司，統轄中央，新中央，卡德，萬國，恩派亞，等五戲院，專映國片，是時國片及外片之營業比較，僅為五與九十五之比，一九二九年，美國各影片公司，紛紛來華設立分公司，如派拉蒙，狐狸等，統制上海電影市塲，同年有聲片開始在華放映。但其結果一方面由於國產片之進步，一方面由於中外言語之閡隔，營業反不及默片時代遠甚，甚至第一流戲院如南京等，亦選映國產如（啼笑姻緣）以資號召。一九三〇年十一月各外片公司聯合大光明，南京，國泰，卡爾登，夏令配克，威利等戲院，組織中國外片商聯合會，勃拉（R.　B.　Butter）任主席，設法推進營業，然卒以市况蕭條，工商凋零，至一九三四年，其營業額反較前數年减百分之二十五，同時我國政府，亦努力提倡國產電影，頒佈獎厲辦法，盡量减少賦稅，並增加外片進口稅，檢查費，以示限制。自是以還，國片在滬之市塲始稍增，然目前上海開映第一流國片者，仍僅金城一家，外片勢力仍有决定之作用在焉。</p>
<p>國片之市塲，固不限於上海一埠，如武俠片時代，盛行南洋各埠，若干公司甚至專銷南洋五屬，（英屬南洋，荷屬南洋，菲列濱暹羅，安南，）近來內地戲院日增，國片市塲擴大不少。但自神怪武俠片被查票後，近數年之出品，已不若以前為南洋僑胞所歡迎，更以南洋市面，亦日趨衰落，故國片之主要營業，仍在上海，但一方面上海各開映國片之戲院，仍感供給不足，一方面製片商仍以一部影片在滬開映後，外埠可輸映之處太少，仍需虧本，因此不敢多有出品，此實為影片營業之一癥結。（未完）</p>

<p>同盟社柏林十六日電　集合全世界靑年勇士六千人表演熱烈競技之第十一屑國際奧林匹克大會、自八月一日開幕後，迄今十六日、盛極一時、已於十六日午後七時在格爾尼瓦爾特大運動塲舉行莊嚴之閉會典禮、自七時廿分馬拉松塔上喇叭齊鳴、聲震遐邇、各國旗手各捧其國旗、在進行曲伴奏之下、魚貫入塲、向正面貴賓席、排為橫隊、當時由國際奧林匹克委員長拉資爾伯爵，起立致閉會辭、其次奏以「火熖曲」、七時卅三分下令降旗、於是樂聲悠揚、祝砲連響、五輪之大會旗漸次下降、馬拉松塔上所燃之火炬、亦不知何時消熄、令人不禁發生離愁、卸下之奧林匹克旗、由代行洛山磯市長迦蒙德氏交與柏林市長李培爾氏、復將書明德國一九三六年、希臘一八九六年、日本一九四〇年之三大旗杆上、以希臘國旗為中心、左為德國旗、右為日章旗、乃明白表示下屆大會將在東京舉行之意、最後由平沼團長、代表日本奧林匹克委員會登臺說明東京奧林匹克大會時、務請早臨等語、於是全塲掌聲如雷貫耳、其後則由德國大樂隊合唱奧林匹克歌、歌畢鐘聲繼起、連響五分鐘之久、自此各國選手隊漸次退出、會塲本屆大會、乃宣吿圓滿結束、午後八時散會、</p>

<p>（中央社特派員十六日柏林廣播）昨日意奧之足球决賽、在大會塲內舉行、為開幕以來、最熱鬧之項目、觀衆有十六萬人、此外因無法購買入門券、竚立塲外、聽無綫電播音者、尙有數千人、其盛况可知、大會球塲、碧草如茵、平垣無垠、極利於奔馳、塲之四週、僱用孩童百餘名、專司拾球之職、以免延誤時間、兩國觀衆、均組織啦啦隊、吶喊助威、情狀至為熱烈、</p>
<p>意得錦標　確非倖致</p>
<p>比賽時無一分鐘不現非常緊張之態、兩隊表演、甚臻佳妙、前鋒進攻、與乎後衛扼守、均有獨到之處、劇戰四十五分鐘、各無所獲、下半時各入一球、延長三十分鐘、意攻入　球、奪得勝利、意國之奪得錦標、自有其特長、固非僥倖而致、後衛鎭守、嚴如鐵壁、前鋒進攻、迅速無比、尤以左翼之表演、最為出色、犀利非凡、傳球射球、得心應手、全隊合作、一氣呵成、</p>
<p>奧隊守門　全球獨一</p>
<p>奧大利亦屬勁旅、表演甚佳、否則决不致延長時間、更不止負此一球、奧隊守門之技巧、載譽全塲、高球跳球、或跳或臥、均能挽救、神妙無比、尤以精砷之勇敢、更足欽佩、所負之兩球、均係萬不得已耳，觀衆謂如組織世界足球隊、與其他星球對抗、前鋒前衛、各國均有特色人材、挑選匪易、惟奧之守門、必能膺選、則毫無疑議、</p>
<p>上半時雙　方無所獲</p>
<p>比賽時、雙方求勝心切、舉動不免過火、引為遺憾、開賽後、奧首取攻勢、不得逞、意遂反攻、有翼沿邊長驅而人、奧中銜綫與後衛呼應招架、球一度在鬥口盤旋、厥狀甚險、未幾、奧隊亦在意門前大顯威風、幸射門欠準，以免於危、其情况緊張劇烈、嘆為觀止、四十五分鐘鏖戰、各無所獲、</p>
<p>意開紀錄　隊員狂歡</p>
<p>易地後、兩隊奪標心切、更見精彩戰戰的二十四分鐘、意左翼輕騎襲入、盤球至距敵門脚踢去、奧鐵門臥地拍出、意左翼復趕上一脚、應聲入網、首開紀錄、意球雖羣向左翼握手在吻、觀衆作歡呼雷震、此後意隊聲勢甚熾、奧盡力反攻、距終了時的九分鐘、果然候得機會、左內鋒帶球連破數關、在敵後　綫距門約十數碼處、舉足射門、球直門之左上角飛八、意守門猶以為球已出界、瞠目不知所措、遂以一比一成和局、</p>
<p>延長時間　最後勝利</p>
<p>延長時間三十分鐘、奧為先發制人起見、大舉進攻、仍未遑、意右翼復興問罪之　、沿邊直入、將至底綫處、將球傳交左翼、左翼得球後、帶一上至距門祗五碼、一脚射中、遂勝一球、歡呼之聲又起、奧負此球不得不力圖反攻、除守門外、餘均越過中綫、努力收復失地、意亦調兵四師、嚴密防守、至最後五分鐘、奧在意門前約二十碼左右、接連射球三次、均被阻止此殆大意歟、</p>

<p>（三九）亞林匹克新村</p>
<p>亞林匹克新村、建築在柏林市郊外四十公里都不雪芝Topsille的附近、新村的房屋、雖然落成不久、可是德國籌備建造這座新村、已經費了十多年的經營、所以百四十多英畝的地面上、鋪了碧綠的草地、種了高大的樹木、簡直同花園一樣、據說世運會閉幕後、這座新村、就要改為兵營、德國人無論做什麼事、總是這樣有計劃的、</p>
<p>新村的前面、建了一座人字形的兩層樓房、呌作國際大樓、可以說是新村的大本營、除掉辦事處外、每個參加國家都有一間辦公室、此外並附設郵局電局銀行商店、設備頗為周到、所以新村雖離柏林市很遠、但選手們日常所需用的東西都可以在這裏購買、毫無缺陷、</p>
<p>新村最高行政人員是總督、下面派了許多高級軍官軍士、及靑年服務團，關於新村的治安及秩序、由高級軍官督率軍士、負責維持、而一切服務、則由靑年服務團團員擔任、靑年服務團團員、都是大學或中學的學生、事前並加以特別的訓練、他們都穿着白色制服、按着他們所通的外國語、分配在各國的宿舍服務、代表整齊、大方態度、和靄誠摯、派在中國選手宿舍裏服務的團員、由軍官羅靄夫kuef　Y指揮、羅氏曾在我國充任顧問、講一口純粹的官話、同選手們談得極為投機、</p>
<p>新村大樓、有一間打字室、由十多位年靑女子在裏面擔任打字的工作、凡是簡要她們帮忙的時候、無不欣然接受、除掉這——多位女子外、新村裏冉也不能找到其他的女性了、</p>
<p>新村的新屋、共有一百七十八幢、每幢房屋及每條道路、都用德國的地名、題了一個名字、每座房屋裏、就按着她的地名、掛了當地的地圖、使各國選手能够很容易的認識、德國宣傳方法、可稱巧妙極了、</p>
<p>新村裏最大的一座房子、呌作柏林大樓、高四層、下面還有地下室、是各國選手聚餐的飯廳、這座大樓共有四十多個房間、每間後面、都有一個廚房、廚房裏所用的材料、莊在地下室、需要的時候、可用電話通知、各國餐室外面都有本國的標記、日美義三國選手最多、所以餐室也最大、我國選手的餐室、左鄰保加利亞、每餐都有不同的菜單、並且按着各國的口味烹調、我國選手每餐可吃白米飯、一湯兩菜、味極可口、至於鶏蛋牛奶咖啡水菜、可以盡量享用、沒有一個人不感覺滿意、</p>
<p>宿舍都是平房、每幢十一間、每間二人、不但裝有電話浴室、甚至連毛巾被蓋牙刷牙粉、也完全供給、可謂無微不至、我國選手占第七十·七十二·九十·九十二·幢、惟七十二號則與墨西哥選手合用、女選手另住女子宿舍、與新村相距甚遠、國術男選手寄居兵營、此外田徑籃球拳擊舉重競走自行車等隊代表、都住在新村裏、</p>
<p>新村裏設有兩所醫院、一所是普通醫院、一所是專門醫院、所用醫師、都是在德國很有名望的人物、醫院記備之完全、器具之新頴、國內許多大醫院、都難望其項背、專門醫院裏的X光、可以把心胃跳動的情形、照射得很淸楚、各國選手都乘這揩油的機會、檢查身體、醫師們大有應接不暇之慨、</p>
<p>新村裏的運動塲、不但範圍很大、並且設備新頴、跑道是用黃沙鋪的、堅硬適度、遠勝煤屑跑道、跳坑則塡白沙、跳欄同跳高架、也是用最新式的方法、每天早上五點半、各國選手就開始練習、以芬蘭的幾位長跑專家、及美國的短黑人、最為人注意、鬭　及拳擊塲共有七八個之多、每天上下午都有友誼比賽、吸引了很多觀衆、</p>
<p>晚上九點到點、在興登堡大樓舉行游藝會、歌舞電影、以及各種游藝、無不節目精彩、大有令人目不暇接之概、各國選手、都可自由參加、無異舉行一個國際聯歡會、美國選手共達三百餘人、服裝奇形怪狀、態度活潑天眞、最為全塲所注目、總之、選手們寄居在環境幽美的新村裏、每天過着有規律有興趣的生活、精神身體、都是十分的愉快、大會開幕後、總該多造一點優異的紀錄出來吧、</p>

<p>上海市體育塲主辦之首屆市長杯公開男子網球單打錦標比賽、昨日上午九時决複賽計分四組、結果王相東·唐寳嘉·徐增瑞·羅民夢四人、獲得複賽權、以四人將於明日下午五時半舉行複賽、採五賽三勝制、（今日無比賽）茲將昨賽情形及明日秩序分誌如下、</p>
<p>王栩東勝　德民</p>
<p>王相東與許德民雙方旅鼓相當、許先量得一局後、王卽送成平局、以二比一領前、但不久王許又以五比二超出、此後又多取一局、王以六比三、奪得首賽、第二賽競爭更為激烈、局勢動人、你來我往、各不相謙、但許求勝心過勢、先誤頗多、致被王以六比四連勝、</p>
<p>唐　嘉勝王叔慶</p>
<p>唐　嘉一經接觸、卽施以銳利之發球、猛烈之抽擊、一氣　成連勝五局、王叔慶小心翼翼、扳回二局、唐復連殺帶抽、卽以六比二獲首賽、决盤　再接再厲以五比二估先、王見勢不佳、振作精神、長抽短送、追成五比四、至此唐卽以準確之對角長抽、使王頗於奔命、唐遂以六比四勝、</p>
<p>徐增瑞勝胡仲光</p>
<p>徐與胡之球藝、顯有高下、徐之獲勝、自在意中處鋒後、徐卽以極猛烈之抽擊、連取二局、胡於極度之奮爭中、扳回一局、但轉瞬間、徐卽以六比一結束第一賽、第二盤開始、胡年齡太輕、精力不足、出球已乏管束力、至三比〇後、始藉發球機會、扳回一局、結果終以六比一負、</p>
<p>羅民　勝張淪泉</p>
<p>左手將軍羅民夢、昨以大刀闊斧之　法、痛擊張淪泉、故首盤勝來、未見費力、决盤張沉着應戰、曾一度以四比三領前、第八局開始雙方競爭甚烈、平等局面者達十二次之多、終以羅民夢球藝純熟、又以六比四勝、</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>籌設市立上海體育專科學校播音演講詞</p>
<p>一個國家發展、民族的復興、其最基本的條件、首在亢進民族細胞的機能、發展國民智·德·體的優性、西洋古代哲學家拍拉　（plato）氏、論理想國家的建立、便要其國民具備四種德性、一是公正、二是節制、三是智慧、四是勇敢、公正是一切德性之基本、節制可防止慾性的放縱、智　則可以治國、勇敢則可以衛國、我國古之聚賢、其所以教民的原則、亦不外三點、</p>
<p>一曰智、</p>
<p>二曰仁、</p>
<p>三曰勇、故曰「智仁勇三者、乃天下之達德」、這三種德性、就個人的立塲說、便是完成自我人格的要件、就國家的立塲說、尤為建國强國的要素、所以智·仁·勇——或說智德體的國民優性的培養與發展、實在是教民建國的首要工作、在復興民族的過程中、負教民建國之重任者、對於此種國民智·德·體優性的培養、固不應忽視、或偏廢、同時我們身為國家細胞的國民、如果要想負起其救亡圖存、復興民族的偉大的使命、允應當智德兼備、文武雙修、以平衡發展其智德體的擾性、充分發揚其智仁勇的達德、</p>
<p>不幸過去中國的儒者、誤解了聖道的眞諦、錯認了教育的範疇、徒事誦讀、不務實際、空談性理、不重力行、好逸惡勞、主持斥進、從而造成了一種虛無頹廢的學風、影響所及、遂使民志萎靡、國族日衰、貧弱之由、此實厲階、自新興學、西洋體育的方法、旣移植於中土、而全國各處的學風、也有所轉移、但是又因體育方針的錯誤、旣未立健全的制度、又沒有完善的組織、以及適當的訓練、而有一部份致力體育的人、也不免醉心功名、沈迷虛榮、平時旣不專課業、臨塲復各抱私見、甚且浮噪囂張、以體育視為少數特殊份子的專利、把體育正當而偉大的意義與功能、毀滅殆盡、而於一般國民體格的健强、以及整個社會生產力與國家自衛力的增進、却毫無裨益、</p>
<p>此次世界運動會在柏林舉行、我國雖有選手參加、但是與各　兒競賽的結果、無論田徑·游泳·足球·　球各類、都不能與人爭勝、我們參加世運的目的、固不在與人爭一日的短長、我們此次慘敗的結果、雖更不應失望而志餒、但是前事不忘後事之師、他山之石、可以攻玉、我們觀感所及、對於各國體育的方針、體育的制度、體育的組織、體育的方法、體育的訓練、以及體育的精神、却不能不擇善而從、以資借鏡、對於自己的缺點——無方針、無組織、無方法、無訓練、不努力、不認眞、不奮勵、不合作的缺點、更不能不痛切反省、進求改善、</p>
<p>歐戰以後、世界體育的方針、因受時代的壓力、復應環境的需求、已有更新的轉變、而各國賢明的當局、對於體育的意義、允有更新的認識、如意大利、則以體育為訓練靑年、復興民族的急務、如蘇俄則以運動的競賽、是一種「國防與生產的考試」、所以現在的體育、巳不是選手的專利、允不是消遣的玩意、其範圍已日趨普及、幾巳與全國民衆打成一起、其目的復注重生產國防、除强健國民身心、訓練普通技藝外、復施以各種有關於增進生產能力興作戰技術的訓練、期使全國民衆、都能有長期勞動、為國民抗戰的能力與精神、</p>
<p>中國以積弱之深、國民體格如此孱弱、國民精神如此萎靡、生產能力如此落後、國防慕礎、如此薄弱、則中國今日之體育方針、實有澈底加以改造之必要、而今日中國之體育家、允應盡祛個人的虛榮、力除浮囂的積習、不以跑跳嬉逐、玩物喪志、謂已盡體育的能事、應該深切認識現代體育進展之動向、及其偉大的意義、苦修勤練、努力向上、「苦其心志、勞其筋骨」、俾得負起復興民族艱鉅的使命、使我們貧弱的祖國、危殆的國運、得有富强與轉機的希望、</p>
<p>本市有鑒及此、因想我用現有廣大的運動塲、設立一個規模較備的體育專科學校、以為改造中國體育方針的試騐、本着體育國防化、軍事化、生產化、與普及化的原則、按着民族現實的需要、培養新的健全的體育師資，以為訓練全國靑年的導師、在强化　般國民體格以外、復能興發國民萎糜不振的精神、改造國民頹廢因循的劣性、使舉國人民都在健全的體育方針之下、養成一種艱苦卓絕忠勇奮勵的精神、以普遍的提高社會的生產力、充實民族的自衛力、不僅在與各國健兒競技的時候、能奪得錦標、並且還要在民族鬥爭嚴重的關頭、能為捍衛國家生存的勇士、以爭取並永保我們民族的光榮、二十五年八月十六日、</p>

<p>「蠶絲麥熟」，本為農民最有希望的時季，但自連年蠶　小麥市價低　，農民不但難得有好處，實際上還是要虧蝕。有以為蝕本事情，農閩決不會去亁的。這眞是不知稼　艱難的人們。要知道農民工作是不計工値的，今日耕　，明天施肥，一把汗，一把水，晴要做，雨要做，若照機關公司商店工廠以及一切按工計値的人們，同樣計算，那末，一升麥一盡　的成本，照市出售，虧　倒有百分百的可能。好在農民氣量寬宏，決不如資本家的錙銖必較，所以市價無論如何低廉，他總肯出賣；而且不以為怨，明年仍照常育種。其實農民也不是下愚如此。蓋旣無法避免工商界之剝　，又舍此並破衣粗食亦不可得，聊　於無，還是去苦　罷！及一轉移間，耳聽行，物價又突地報漲了，也　怪當初賣的太早，命運不好，賣不着好價錢，而不知其中鬧着玄虛，此雖不是一定的辦法，年來操縱之術愈工，沒有人去監督他們不操縱，常有這般情形。以下且就絲麥兩項分論之。</p>
<p>一蠶絲</p>
<p>自從統制潮流到中國，處處談統制，蠶繭自亦不能例外。統制並不是壞事，但是切不可以為一談統制，就要一切由我去管理。卽使應該要管理，做管理員的也要有實際經騐。不看別的，只看工廠的管工，用些不知所管為何事的人去辦；工廠就糟了。何况育蠶事業，散在各處，比工塲管理更難，那可輕率去做。故如今最要緊的倒是如何逐漸使他們有組織起來，並且改善他們向來育養不合法的地方，以便增進他們的產量，俾得到有利的代價，提高他們育蠶的興趣。關於製種方面已見有相當努力，但亦不過販進外國蠶種，替換土種罷了。關於育養方法，不是陳義太高，使農民望望然而去之；卽是勦襲皮毛，不合農民實際之使用。中國養蠶，旣有四千餘年歷吏，當然也有其長處，否則蠶種還會流傳到今日，風行到外國。不過，舊時育養的方法，知其然而不知其所以然的地方正多，現在應該就各地方養蠶習慣，硏究共得失，補充其不足，方為正辦。農民知織淺薄是事實，然而他們常會用推論的方法去育蠶。有人吿訴我說，某農家育蠶，見蠶將僵化，彼以為此猶人之有寒痧，（痧之為何，是另一問題）治痧旣用痧藥水，蠶痧亦何嘗不可用，因以痧藥水和水噴於葉上，蠶食之果得救。此種辦法，原不可以為訓，並千萬不要誤解痧藥水可以治僵蠶，用以作廣吿宣傳。究竟因何而不致僵化，以及有無其他原因，還當別論。作者所以走筆及此，蓋以見中國育蠶方法，頗多從經騐中得來，必有許多良法在，不過使用未得其宜，或應再須運用科學方法，加以整理，然後因勢利導，使之糾正改善，千不要開口閉口掮出外國招牌來。如果眞個是專家的話，必能新舊　會，自然地產生一種新文化或新組，適應現在的需要，不是生吞活剝讀死書的說織法。</p>
<p>在先，以絲價之在落，絲商頗蒙損失。如今則不然，繭價旣有限制，農民不能售善價，而絲價則頻年報漲，不受絲毫牽掣。所以這幾年絲商失敗的失敗，得意者得意。然就多數之利害以為利害，保障絲商的利益固緊要，農民的利益允重要。若祇題少數絲商及投資放欵者利益，而規定價格收買鮮繭，一要吃羊肉，不　羊性命，」似應加以一番考慮。</p>
<p>絲商旣然獲得優勢，故各銀行春繭放欵，早巳如數收回。秋繭放欵，亦無庸再辦，想見躊躇滿志之狀。曾記得歐戰時候，麵粉廠紗廠鐵廠頗　了許多意外之財，但用以為分紅派息，以及儻來之物儻來用，而今如何。目前的絲業那裏能及當年紗廠的萬一，不過稍有沾潤，還是從繭價方面得來，如其經營有餘利的話，希望他們用以為改良機械設備，發展對外貿易，莫如以前各廠祇顧分紅派利，絕不為將來營業發展計。果能如此，則農民繭價雖受有損失，尙不失為楚弓楚得。</p>
<p>生絲出口檢騐聞已實行，分級尙須期諸來年。惟於此可見絲業對於本身改革，猶未能竭誠以赴。說到生絲檢騐，光緒三十四年就有人建議於上海地方創設生絲檢察所，淸廷僅飭上海商會邀集絲商董若干員報部遴委再核。民國成立，關於改進生絲之理論，汗牛充棟，然四十年來，事態依然。在外人一年有一年之進步，一月有一月之功夫，而在吾國，無論為何等人，祇會口頭禪，一切理論，用以為私人利益之工具，作粉飾門面之計，未能切實去做，衰亡之來，蓋由於此。今絲業已瀕於絕途，若猶燕巢危幕，不能打起精神，力求振作，欲以不同級之絲，售相等之價，誰肯前來惠顧。</p>
<p>二小麥</p>
<p>最近關於小麥出口問題，雜糧業與麵粉業以立塲不同，主張各異。報載有實業部召集會議以事决定之說，確否待將來事實證明。</p>
<p>不過要注意者，雜糧業所說小麥一陳陳相因必至紅腐委地，」未免過甚其詞。而持論根　原為一種估計。依照中國目前情形，不要說全國，卽是一地方的生產，能有一比較可靠的估計，尙不易為，乃敢說某年某物生產幾千幾百幾十萬，損失若干萬，種植若干畝，不知用何種調查方法，從何處估計得來。如此行動，固不便說他是在妄，亦未免太膽大了。工業品生產，集中於工廠，旦有紀錄可憑，尙不能得到較可靠之統計，何况散漫紛雜之農產。又如海關進出口統計，人人以為可靠，而不知每年私貨出入，正不知有多少，為關冊所未列。所以統計一門，眞難言之。故編製統計，自應力求審愼，務使證信之程度多一分，好一分；可疑之成分少一分是一分。無以驚奇炫多為能，假使統計之基礎是不可靠，徒然淆惑聽用，當非編製統計之本意。故今雜糧業所藉口過剩與麵粉業之藉口民食，同為營業上之烟慕彈，皆以為各便私圖之作用。</p>
<p>故茲無論小麥為有餘為不足，均非禁止出口所能解决。惟小麥距出新之期匪遙，農民雖有售去，多少尙有積存，故物價出新而漲，與農民為有利。况在日人未採辦前，粉麥卽已上漲，可見麥價之貴，並不全由於出口，至多為其中原因之一。雜糧業自見日商採辦，想必亦有不少囤積，因懼粉業之計售，故以有　為無須禁止出口之理由，俾得仍售善價。麵粉業因小麥出新時經各方面收買之結果，不能再如往年得有廉價之原料，故非設法使麥價自歸於平落不可。凡此鈎心鬥角，均何嘗為民食計，亦何嘗為農民計。故假使雙方所主張者皆為事實，則如何使穀賤不傷農，穀貴不傷民，又如何調節得宜，俾各業皆有發展之望，且看此後之設施。</p>
<h3 id="c152">麥產豐收聲中之洋麥進口 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 警石</p>
<p>最近報載國內各地麥產豐收，價格亦廉。故日商紛向內地採辦，已有一萬三千餘噸之鉅。致機製粉業大起恐慌，有呈請實業部，禁止小麥出口之舉。另一方面値此新麥登塲之際，粉廠又轉向國外購進洋麥三船，的二十萬包到滬。雖說是早先定貨，但此種矛盾現欽，實使局外者莫明所以。惟證諸以往事實，亦不足奇。吾人尙慷民國二十三年時全國受普遍早災影響，食糊收成大减，而是年輸入洋米不過七，七一一千公担，洋麥四，六四九千公担，麪粉五九六千公担。民二十二年全國雨水均勻，各地豐收，反造成穀賤傷農之局。其由外國輸入之洋米竟有一二，七八七千公担，洋麥　〇，五七六公担，麪粉一，九三三千公担之鉅額輸入。觀此則我國每年食糧之源源而入，是否為國內食糧不足之明證，頗屬疑問。然外糧輸入之反常，其與國內食糧收成之豐歡，及供求關係之不相牟殆可斷言。故此次麥產豐收與購進洋麥，又踏往昔矛盾之覆轍者，固非創見，究共內容；似亦有下列之原因在焉。</p>
<p>一　實際缺少與洋麥進口</p>
<p>我國小麥之生產，幾遍全國；惟產　多少，無精確統計可　參考，據一般估計全國產量均在四萬數千萬市扣以上，自民國二十年至二十四年止，五年間平均每年產量為四四六，三三九千市担，本年據農情報吿估計收成為四萬七千萬餘市担，為近幾年收穫預測最高額。再就近五年輸入額平均為一一，五八八，九七市担，如兩者相加减去復輸出六一一，一二八市担則兩共為四六八，三一六，七七九市担。至小麥消費量為四六二，四三五千市担，以每年平均收　相抵似尙缺少一六，〇九六千市担，（註一）故每年小麥輸入，據閱册所載最近四年數字，在民邪廿一年為五，一二九，八七九公担，廿二年一〇，七一四，六三八公担，廿三年四，六四九，四一九公担，廿四年五，二〇九，〇八七公担，本年上半年亦達一，一一七，七二六公担，其中頗有與的計數字相近者，亦有超過此數者。此蓋枚國小麥產區旣廣，往往在遼遠之處，雖有剩餘，以　輸不便，未能調劑缺乏者之　要，於是缺少者愈感不足，不得不仰給洋麥以資補充，此其原因之一。</p>
<p>二　麪粉廠之需要洋麥</p>
<p>小麥最大之消費，為麪粉廠之原料。據　報年鑑載　國麪粉廠計　九十餘廠，分佈　廣，計十有三省。全年產量達七千五白萬袋，價値在二萬萬元以上。產量以蘇浙皖三省最大，占十分之六，魯豫次之占十分之二，其他合計占十分之二。廿三年度之產銷量有如下表（註二）</p>
<p>據上表所列，廿三年產量為七四，九三〇，四六五袋，每袋為四十九磅。按每市担小麥可製粉六十二磅餘，則每年所需小麥應為四四，一二〇，七四五市担為小麥消費之最大者。但國內所產小麥品質較洋麥為差，製粉非攙用洋麥不可。此外以運輸不便及運費之昂貴亦使粉厰採用洋麥原因之一。蓋以洋麥論由坎拿大小麥運至上海其每担運費不過國幣六角左右，而華北一帶小麥運至上海每担至少須八九角以上。又美麥一噸到上海，包括一切稅捐運費在內，只須三十元，如從陝西中部，運麥一噸至上海，乃須一百三四十元。况我國市塲所有之小麥純係農民自用剩餘，而後售諸市塲。因之欲購犬宗須由多方囤積而成。决不如他國，立時卽可採辦大批食糧可比，故我國中部各省所產之麥，其可以供給製粉原料者，僅敷八個月之用。兼以採辦費時費力，常使粉廠减工或停工以待接濟。因之反不如直接購進洋麥可以减少損失。且每年缺乏數個月之原料，更非洋麥補充不可。試查關册所載，洋麥進口各埠，卽粉廠聚集之地津靑滬漢等處，是就實際而言，每年洋麥進口，幾全部供給粉廠之用。</p>
<p>三　國內外麥價差額與進口</p>
<p>粉廠每年消費小麥，旣屬甚鉅，對於原料價格之貴賤，自有切身利害，必須愼重選擇，蓋粉廠之利潤全視低價購進原料，與高價售出成品，如其問差額愈大，則獲利愈厚。故粉廠在消費方面，自望麥價愈低愈佳。另在生產成品，則望粉價之日趨高翔。此為經營者必然之理無待諱言。故粉廠之採用國麥或洋麥，在視兩者之價格如何而定。共一為洋麥與國麥價格之比較，如洋麥價格較國麥價格為高，則利益麥市價常在上市之前，將期壓低，俾可大量收購，證諸以往大多如此。試以最近兩年市價觀</p>
<p>上列字數趨勢之表示，凡自五月至七月均形下降實甚明顯。本年市價雖往年為高。但粉價亦與之成比例。據此事論，則洋麥之進口，似屬多此一舉，正可收購國內麥產，今不此圖，而向國外購進，是不啻購進外麥，以為威脅國麥市價之不易振作，而造成甚小，進口自可因之减少。如差額甚微，則利益大，易促進洋麥之輸人。其二為洋麥與粉價之比較。按洋麥每担可製粉八十斤，如八十斤之麥粉售價與麥價相等，則其餘麩皮等副產品，可抵原料以外之支出，是已有利可圖，如超出麥價則所獲更大，購進洋麥自屬合算。因此粉廠之直接採辦外麥，固不僅為國內麥產是否足於供給，其關鍵在於是否合算也。况外國之農產品積極商品化，恃其政治與經濟為後盾，努力向外傾銷，以遂其侵略市塲之慾望，則國內農產更難與之抗衡，祇可視其源源輸入而巳。</p>
<p>且生產者與消費者，恒立於相對地位，已如上述，則麥農之所希望以善價出售者，卽為粉廠所不欲。反之，粉廠出低價收買小麥，亦為農民所不願。惟農產品，在此工業發達之時，原料嘗被工業者所支配，而無由自主。卽以此次，國內豐收與外麥進口論，亦屬操縱市價之一端。蓋國產小麥在國內市塲，可以排擠外麥者僅在秋季，因新貨上市，來源甚旺，外麥自無挿足之地，此後則以農民無久儲之所，或急於脫手，均於登塲時售去，故第一第二及四季均為中外麥兼辦時期。惟粉廠為小麥之最大消費者，而有此矛盾之現象。此殆工業者操縱原料之措置，又為外麥輸入之另一原因矣。</p>
<p>綜上所述，我國粉廠採用洋麥，其由於國內麥產之不敷，或於技術上必須摻用少數洋麥者，則未始不可購進洋麥以為調劑。如以豐收之年，或適在新麥登塲時，購進洋麥，則難免另有用意之議，果爾，則不特直接摧殘農民之利益，亦間接動搖國本也。至此次日商之大量收買，其影響於民食固鉅，然際此商品國際化之時，欲以斷然禁止，恐亦難於收效。吾人但望粉廠與糧商合作，各各顧及民食之利害，而以公充之價格收買之，則兩者互受其益矣。此外吾人更願當局與產消雙方作更進一步之努力，卽此後麥產之品質務求改良，以適合於工業原料之標準；（二）增加產量以適合國內需安（三）農產運輸，應盡量减低運費以暢其流，（四）多設倉庫，以備較久之屯貯（五）平衡市價，以免投機之操縱，凡此各端，苟能按步而行，則整個之民食問題亦可迎刃而解，豈特小麥一項而已哉。註一　見國際貿易尊報道八卷六號「中國食糧供求的新估計」註二　二十五年申報年鑑麪粉工業　八，一四。</p>
<h3 id="c153">桑地遞减的原因安在 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 李寅北</p>
<p>米·麥·棉·絲·茶；為我國農業產品之基礎。其中蠶絲一項，潤澤於農村經濟流通者允鉅。但自民國十九年以來；農戶育蠶，非惟無利可得；抑目有賠本之累，於是紛粉將供作蠶兒糧食的桑樹鋤去，改栽其他作物。我們目前雖然沒有精確的統計可供研究；但在另一方面從生絲產量减退上加以推算：也可以反映出近年來桑園去留的概况。茲將最近五年來七種生絲出口貿易情形列表於下。（單位担）</p>
<p>生絲為我國對外貿易之大宗；國內　場除內地　綢廠消納少數外，要之亦視洋莊銷路的　靜為聯繫。我們看上表，雖然不能絕對說生絲輸出貿易的逐年减退就是桑園的减少；但是我們不能不　為生絲逐年减退的數字，却是蠶農育蠶數量减少的反映。這是無可諱言的事實。蠶農育蠶减少，桑園便呈供過於求的　象；我們若更進一步依據江蘇省桑園的飼養力來　；每畝桑園所產的葉片，的可飼養收穫八斤鮮繭的蠶兒。（見　十四年六月　——　日上海時事新報蘇省之蠶桑事業）再假定生絲的繅　是五百盡，亁　的烘折是三百；那末生產生絲一担，則　桑園十八畝七分平。——（一担生絲×五　折×三烘折×一〇〇斤　八〇斤鮮　日一八·七五畝）若依數來推算，則近年桑園的供需情形，則如下表。</p>
<p>從民國二十年以後，桑園生產的葉片逐年呈露供過於求的情形。蠶農為要謀過剩的桑園生息起見，往往將過剩的桑園鋤去另栽其他作物；此種情形，在江蘇的無錫，金壇；與浙江的湖杭等地為最盛。大致因為該地農村，其人民以養蠶植桑為主要的產業；一旦生絲價格暴落，育蠶農戶，則驟然减少其數量，而過剩的桑園損失特多！為此，不得易植稻麥，藉資補救。</p>
<p>其次至於蠶農去桑易植的前因是怎樣？我們可從下列三方面來討論：</p>
<p>（甲）社會文化的進步與生絲消費之轉變這是一個蠶農去桑易植運動的根本原因。查我國生絲的銷路，以美銷法銷為大宗。但自人造絲發明後，世界人士對於人造絲的生產，推銷與消費　者，均起了一個非常的轉變；其中允以消費者對於人造絲引起了相當的信念。試觀目前的絲織品，要求　種純粹的生絲織造品，是已不可能的了。在織綢廠方面，倒幷不是企圖輕工减料；而却是消費者的心理樂用人造絲的有光彩所致。這是整個文化上新陳代謝的作用，使我們無從挽回的。國際生絲協會，International　Silk　Guild　Inc（國際生絲協會，山美國絲業界鉅了乾利等所發起，成立於一九三年八月，設總辦事處於紐約。）是復興生絲推銷工作的有力團體；但是她對於人造絲影　消費者的心理，也　能用消極的批評手段來宣傳。她於成立大會宣　中說：「近數年來，向稱繁榮之絲業，為人造絲侵佔　盡！織綢廠家因生絲與人造絲幷川，故不願發起　贊助宣傳任何一方之工作。惟少數絲織家，仍以為美國生絲界應不　一艱難，竭力謀生絲之進展：至於生產國家如日意及中國，更應與美國宣傳生絲之團體合作。務使生絲之優點，重行映入普通顧客之腦筋。」且科學愈昌明，則各種的驚人發明愈多：再據二十二年十二月六日上海金融業報載，日本富士絹絲公司，卽將從事「再新絹絲」之製造云云：查冉新絹絲，為日人因自國人造絲原料缺乏而刻苦硏究成功替代人造絲之絲質。其製法，卽係以舊絲綢或絲繭下脚，用化學方法洗漂溶化，再用製造人造絲方法製之成絲。故日人稱為再新絹絲。預料此絲一經問世，於生絲前途，必將另加一種侵佔與排擠了。</p>
<p>（乙）人為的經濟地位落後其次人為的經濟地位落後，也是一個有力原因。人為的經濟地位落後，便造成國際的經濟地位落後。須知生絲是國際市塲裏的商品，與一國的政治，幣制，貿易，匯兌，在在均有息息相關的聯繫。我國處於决殖民地的地位；一舉一動，在在為人所束縛——就最近的事實來說：因匯價穩定，出口絲經，較前為活躍。</p>
<p>（丙）絲本，繭本，蠶本，不能銜接照理論言：絲本，繭本，的貴賤，完全銜接於蠶本。但實際的情形，則不如此。最奇突的，蠶農蠶本所得，與廠家　本所出；兩者之間，往往不能合理的符相。此種情形，蓋因目下收繭方法不良所造成。查現在的收　方法，廠家大都委托鄉村　行代收，其費用　支的浩大，實較任何各業為甚；是以廠家縱出大量資金，而純粹流入蠶農手中者，自難豐潤了。</p>
<p>我們明瞭了此種去　運動的根本原因，那末對於今後栽桑易植的趨向，究竟走那一條路？雖然今年的生絲市價稍呈好轉；鮮繭價格比較往年提高。但是與蠶農的蠶本相差，不足尙鉅，如無錫在春鮮繭行開秤之際，蠶農成羣給隊前赴各方請願的大目標，仍以顧全蠶本和力爭；在其他各地，說不定也有同樣情事發生。因此推想，此種去桑運動，當然　隱伏在各處鄉村，不能說是巳吿消弭。為今之計：在消極方面，務須計劃推廣栽植改良桑種，增强其飼養力。積極方面須提倡養蠶生產合作社，尤其注力於共烘共賣的推行；俾資替代繭行收繭的不經濟。凡此種種，與桑　的去留問題，直接間接均有很大的帮助。</p>
<h3 id="c154">無錫蠶農自烘乾繭之經過 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 王亮豐</p>
<p>無錫蠶桑事業，自實施統制以來，凡蠶種之品種，價格，購買，分配，及管理繭行收繭，徵收改進費，並育蠶指導等項，均有顯著成效，今春（二十五年）對於蠶農自烘乾繭，又經無錫蠶桑模範區，及無錫農民銀行之努力提倡，頗見成效。良以吾國自實施法幣後，余融市塲，國外匯兌，巳見平準，絲價折合，可無極大上下。冉自二十四年上期起，美國之經濟情形，漸見轉機，故絲價繼續上漲，輸出增加，前途已見有好望。鮮繭為農民之生產品，欲為維持生產成本，農民應有論價地位；欲求有論價地位，惟有將鮮繭烘成乾繭，方可達到。而今春無錫有組織大規模之收繭公司，希圖獨佔，產品價格，恐不免為所操縱壓迫；是則農民自烘乾繭，尤為緊要。</p>
<p>蘇省為便利農民自烘乾繭，並積極實施起見，特訂有推行蠶業生產合作實施辦法，於二十五年三月二十四日由省府會議通過，令飭無錫縣縣長兼蠶桑模範區正主任會同合作指導員以中心育蠶指導所為基礎，先行指導蠶農組織業務。地方人士自動組織養蠶合作社五十餘處，加以原有之產銷合作社二十餘處，合共八十餘處。所有地點，業已分佈全縣，故蠶農自烘乾繭，得有相當組織。</p>
<p>合作社烘繭，首需備有繭灶，若聽其自行建筑，在經濟與時間上，容有困難，故蠶業生產合作實施辦法中規定，凡經模範區核准開秤之繭行，育蠶聯合社，有租用之優先權。然查此項辦法在事實上與環境上，不無窒礙，良以無錫農村間，原有不及四乘以下之單灶，被取締者甚多，為兼籌並顧計，特由省府允許合作社，收買此項應受取締之繭灶，作為社員烘繭之用。在各繭行可化無用為有用，在各合作社亦得適用之繭灶，並規定合作社，如因資金缺乏，在未曾收買以前，亦准暫時租用。今春經無錫縣蠶桑模範區核准合作社租用之繭行共四十七家。（合作社有數社併用繭行一所故繭行數較台作社數為少）共開放單灶一百三十乘，雙灶四乘。其中六家，係合格繭行，其餘皆係經發封之不合格繭行。</p>
<p>無錫農民銀行為扶助各作社烘　起見，又特約絲　庫，並擬訂受抵合作社自烘亁　及貸放烘費辦法。凡各合作社經營烘銷時，如感資金缺乏，得由各合作社負責人向該行借墊，茲摘錄該項辦法如下。　　（一）凡合作社社員聯合自烘之亁　，得向本行借欵，但須合左列各條件：</p>
<p>甲，該項乾繭須堆入本行指定之絲繭倉庫</p>
<p>乙，繭身　良；</p>
<p>丙，洪度均勻適常；</p>
<p>丁，須由合作社負責人員向本行訂的；（一）押價以市價之六成為準；（一）押借期至長五個月；（一）利率月九釐，按日計算；（一）凡合作社因烘焙鮮　所需之烘費，亦得向本持申借，惟須依照左列各欵辦理：　甲，申借時須先估計社員所烘乾繭數量，經本行調查確實；</p>
<p>乙，每乾繭一担，以准借國幣六元為度；</p>
<p>丙，借期至長一個月；</p>
<p>丁，利率月九　按日計算；</p>
<p>統觀合作社，自烘亁　，在政治上金融上，皆得到相當挨助，一切實施自可須利進行。</p>
<p>今春各合作社，烘繭數量，尙無調查統計。惟從各合作社繳納之改進費，可以推算。截至八月底止，全縣合作社共納改進費九千四百三十一元有另，以每乾繭一担，繳納改進費四元五角推算，可知共烘乾繭為二千零九十六　。以鮮繭最多二百斤烘乾繭一担計，估合鮮繭六千二百八——八担。以全縣共納改進費二十一萬推算，自烘乾繭數量，不過的佔全縣百分四·四。數目極小，尙待推廣。又查今春無錫縣扯價為十一元，自春繭有情場以後，海外　價頻漲，乾繭市價，亦隨之上升，每乾繭一担，（老　），可售一百七十元，合市担的一百四十元。各介作社隨時乾繭　續出售，計算比　出售鮮繭，可每祖多合十元以上。自鮮繭上塲，至脫售乾繭，為時不及兩月，烘繭蠶農之增加收入，總的六萬餘元，非少數也。</p>
<p>統計合作社，將自洪就之乾繭，向無錫農民銀行押欵者共十二處，押入乾繭二百八十餘祖，共押借余額二萬二千餘元，的佔自烘乾繭總數百分之一八。凡向銀行押借用欵者，皆共同運銷，未押者，皆烘就後取回零賣，是整個之集體行動，尙為缺少，以後似宜多加注意。凡共烘者以共銷為原則，俾免中間人之剝奪。</p>
<p>今春凡農民自烘者，莫不獲利。鄙見擬在利益中，提存相當成數，作為公積金，以作改良蠶桑經費，或作建築繭灶基金，或抵補意外損失皆無不可。如此項公積金能按期提存，則數目愈積愈大，基礎愈為鞏固，與烘運事業，極有關係，不可忽視者也。</p>

<p>— （蔡選靑）</p>
<p>終日在暑裏行走動作的人，反不得中暑，逍遙暑外的人，反容易中暑。每見鄉村的農夫，日在田間工作，　陽薰灼，汗出如漿，他們並不見得有什麽病，體質且較別人為堅强。富貴人家，大厦層樓，電扇冷氣，燠絕炎威，如置身淸凉世界，不復知紅　中有　暑鬱蒸的苦惱，倘偶然有事須外出，此種與署久已隔絕的身體，最易為暑氣所侵傷。天道之雨潤日暄，陰陽寒　，本為人與物應受的培養與摧殘，倘不如此，則發育滋長上，必感覺偏枯，所以暑是大可不必避的。近者各友邦使節，和我國要人，紛赴靑島北戴河牯牛嶺，富入遠赴日本的更多，都欲避這偪人的炎夏，如果是國家倚重的人才，當然要優加　衛了。下走却來談兩伴舊事：宋代魏公張俊，督師禦金人，部下邵宏淵李顯忠兩將領，意見素不洽，正的期會戰，顯忠聞而大聲曰，「當此盛暑。搖扇於淸凉且猶不堪。而况交戰乎。」於是軍心懈散，致兵潰苻離，敗退二百餘里。淸代曾忠襄國荃，督師攻金陵，曾由六月初一出隊，至六月十六遂克省垣，酷暑鏖兵，半月未經收隊。些二事，一則在盛暑時，圖淸閒而誤國，一則當盛暑時，耐勞苦而成功。寫出來作為避暑諸公在豆棚瓜架下閒話的查料。</p>

<p>南薰蒸夢，溽暑困人，市樓揮汗，雅不能耐，悠然作山林想。薄慕出吳淞，平明人蛟川，招寳一角，曉霧未融，微茫中有拔地掀天意。蜿蜓數上折，消鄞；循市一週，轉轂過寳幢？鄉集耳，寥落無致，而香火鼎盛之阿育王寺，開道塲於其中，實握山家生聚之命脈。環寺居者數百輩，無論農工，衣若食，胥唯山是賴。山僧鼻息，羣仰無敢譁，上下相安，隱然桃源別派。入寺隨喜，法域壯麗，殿宇崔巍，其地淵寂而平曠，無登山陡嶺之勞，市隱不囂，水行無苦，最宜女護法結香火緣，　是金錢佈地，法象宏冠　隅，歷久弗替；然曹溪一勺，臨以探幽　勝之目光，則不免生入山不深，去俗未遠之憾，於是乎亟亟舍去。從少白入天童，雙槳追風，襟欲化，峯迴路轉，前路盡迷，天斗　靑，水鏡涵碧，　艋掠樹影而過，衣袂皆蒼，如坐天上，適非初遭，相舷曼歌曰：「重重嵐翠接茅陽，雙槳衝波過五鄕，一水廻環開地脈，四山合、沓鎖天光；衣冠入目人奇占，甲子何年客健忘，十里寺深僧課寂，幾疑世外有農桑。」其東為茅陽，靈峰諸山，亦祇園勝地。自五鄕　而來，山民樸野，　　如繩，縱貫數十里，平疇阡隴間，時見古衣冠，鬚眉如蛻，熙融在康衢擊壤以上，炎氛半滌矣。舍舟蠟屐入天童道，盤麓而登，古杉蔽天，亂松齊道，濃陰如水，籟簌搖裾袖生深涼，山鳥媚淸簌，為人逐暑，松逕環進，輕濤過頂瀉午雷，魂與俱銷。稍轉巨沼橫前，為魚樂國，逾沼，覩叢綠掩靄中，露微黃一隙，而寺門始徐徐現。幽　玄峭，信可臥阿育王寺於脚下，蓋百步外，雅不能窺豹一斑也。入門，繞廊進，佛宇高敞，無殊阿育王，而一窗一檻間，濃翠塡溢，微陽過關，野馬不騰，靜趣入懷，餘汁悉罷。坐客堂索食，知客吐屬亦中人。出環山縱步，客心轉閒，淸機徐引，不復作出山想；石林小憇，溪瀨潺潺響肘下，老槍呼龍，凉　飄髮，暮禽無聲，雜花在樹，瞑目玄索，似坐空桑，風定花香，微聞淸梵冷然自天際下，雲鐘一聲，衆筑皆寂，瞿而覺，携　歸寺，恍惚餘酣猶未醒也。膳罷，烹茗覓中僧閒話，唯及風月，不宣法乘，茶烟室，坐理鬢絲，萬念若死。未幾；僧去就枕，一月窺人，薄　如水，　懷若遊絲，飄忽中松濤突吼，嗚壑怒張，在　觸空谷作異聲，乾坤動　，斗室萬端；繼而淸磬破夢，曉唄澄心，躍然而蘇，正不知文殊松寥，當復何如？</p>

<p>遊　山者，事先或鼓棹行海，或驅車駛陸，旣抵山，則艱於步者，肩輿尚焉，海航苦風濤，有力者每藉軍艦為之濟；陸行則雇車入山，無患顚簸，遊山如期以一二日，則如雲上見仙，恍惚無定，能探勝奇於什一，蓋亦難矣。</p>
<p>余遊靛缸灣之翌日，興益豪。糾伴擬作太淸宮之遊。時乍陰乍雨，間亦乍晴。車至大勞村，雨勢驟烈，水氣氤氳，雲山誤指。百步外泥淖下瀉，欲進不前。大怖，亟后退，頭面已滿沾黃漿，相顧氣沮。車止沙河畔，急流臨前，勢若在奔，探之及腹，深不可波，近村男婦，羣來觀望，詢之華嚴寺之遊，皆搖首示不可，欲遊惟藉肩輿渡水去神淸宮花花浪已耳。花花浪者。瀑布也·意者當此雨際，定有　觀，乃舍車戴笠雇輿往·初渡沙河，河面闊五丈許，水流湍急，輿夫若蟹行，乘者掩目不敢左右視。東抵大勞觀，稍息，折向南行，迂廻上至神淸宮。小坐啜茗，與老道閒話桑麻。由神淸宮而下，時雨勢已殺，漠漠淡雲，陽光微漏，諸山如流，萬綠加重。后者見前者，素衣皆靑黛，野芳吐馥，　葛牽裾，不覺魂骨俱翠，頓憾此身不遽化為鹿野禽矣。村姑四五，每自籬隙相窺，與輿夫通欵曲·雲髻纖足，宛似三十年　人　經　流村，入山漸深，雜走亂石叢中。向之依希似山徑者，逾進逾不可得。歷　水凡十四，不見村落，不聞犬吠，黑雲下壓，雷在石上。循最后澗而東，不一二里卽七八折，遙聞瀑聲大震，莫究所在。又里許，細雨復作，陰寒似深秋。雨細如霧，人對面莫辨衣著。輿行甚遲，俄聞前人呼曰：「瀑至矣！」遠望山如環帶，前路已塞。峭壁千仞，瀑目環中斷處傾下，畏十餘丈，寬亦丈許；倒縣如素練，莫審所自來。瀑旁長松參天，老蘿冒壁，晃翠飛來，衣袂成霞。下輿，冒雨逆瀑行澗中，不為亂石急流所苦。距瀑五丈，不可復進。踞於危石，悄然有思：彼滔滔者，淸淸冷冷，自　及遐，無舍　夜；不識出山還似在山時否？安得化身千萬，徧歷溪澗，逐審所遇哉！瀑之下也，擊石碎為穴，穴折為溪，溪折為澗，為灘。向之來此無徑，蓋有自矣。野童四五年皆上四五，健碩如成人，赤體戲泉中，宛若春江之鴨</p>
<p>日西哺，相率言返。途中泉嗚如磐，如籥·如，如絲　，如環珮，雜　相送，與邪許聲吟詩聲並作，回抵沙河，水不少减·輿夫不擇淺而渡，乘者衣袴皆濕。相對軒渠不置。</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>華嶽在我的故鄉　陜西，可是我久寓在他方。直到今年才得償我　　的「壯遊」。</p>
<p>華山的路徑是以險峻出名的，然而最使我感到興味的也就是路險。像那「千尺　」，是夾在兩山中間一條梯突的狹路，人上去的時候必須手拉着鐵　膝行而前！又有「蒼龍嶺」，那路是開在一條很長的山脊上，兩邊沒有絲毫憑藉，下臨萬丈深谷！走在這樣驚險的路上，心裏不免拍拍的跳！可是等到走過去，反而有一種勝利的歡喜。還有「猢猻愁」「上天梯」「擦耳崖」「朽木橡」這些地方，從它的名稱上就可以推知它的驚險程度了。</p>
<p>華山的姿態是雄壯而偉大的，它的高度的五千丈，雖然不算是最高的紀錄，但是我入山的時候，轉一個灣眼前就是一個變化，並且變化得是那樣神妙，眞使人胸懷爽豁目不暇接。而山上的凉爽，更大可避暑。</p>
<p>華山的景色是美麗而繁多的，在山前有迥旋流瀑，在山麓有蒼翠的林樹，全山有石洞二十四個，東峯上有「華嶽仙掌」，那是長安八景之一，唐人詩：「仙人掌上玉芙蓉」。就指此處。至於古　方面有「老君掛犁處」「陳搏下棋亭」「武帝問道處」「韓愈投書處」等，不可勝數。</p>
<p>華山的　輿的樣子是很好玩的，那是用一佃有靠背的圈椅，兩邊　着兩個長竹槓，人坐在椅子上背緊　着椅背，兩個人抬起來便算入山代步的工具。等到下山的時候，却把椅子翻轉過來，靠背放在前面，人的胸腹在椅背上，以防跌落上來，這種山輿當地人呌作「華杆」。</p>
<p>華山出人　有一絛道路，大部分都是繫着鐵繩，要靠鐵繩才能爬上的。當地俗諺有「要尋尸首，河南商州」。這兩句話。意思就是說在山中上下的時候，假使失足跌下去，那麽想要找尸首，就得到隣省去找！其實祗須「胸踏實地，步步留神」，（山裏有人刻着這樣的話）·也不致發生危險。山分東西南北中五峯，東西南三峯鼎足而立，最高的還要算南峯。在南峯絕頂上有一池泉水，仰對着天空名「仰天池」。我在那池畔盤桓了半日，俯視雲下的峯巒，巒外的大地，我是第一次才感覺到自然所賦予吾人的廣大了。</p>

<p>第五回　錦喜字重來畫題翠葉　嫁衣驚乍試涙濕絞綃</p>
<p>在那正中的桌子上，放了有幾樣東西，非常的容易入目。就是紅紙剪成的一疊喜字花。還有兩個十錦紙盒子，上面也貼有紅喜字。無論誰家，桌上有了這一類的東西，就應在成年的男子或女子身上。江家兩個兒子，已經結婚多年了。兩位小姐，大的是夢蘭，小的兆蕙，還小着呢。夢蘭這樣的聰敏人，何須仔細去研究，早是猜了個澈底心想呀！這日子快了。以前也曾至再至三的同母親表示，不到畢業以後，不能结婚。看現在這情形，昨天送信來，家裏是完全答應。再說，也許遠在昨日以前，把事情就商量妥當的，不然，這喜字何以預備得這樣子的快呢？夢蘭在一會兒工夫，心裏想着，有好多的來回。他忘了上學去，呆呆的在望屋裏站着，只聽脚下下通一聲，這才醒悟着，低頭看去，夜來是脅下夾的那個書包，不知如何，竟是落到地面上來了。他彎腰把書包檢了起來，早是驚　了掃地的女僕，笑道，喲！大小姐，怎麽站在這裏發呆，有什麽事嗎？時　不早了，快點上學堂去罷。說着把棹上那些東西，趕快向旁邊屋子裏　了去。夢蘭笑着低聲道：你這不是呌着瞎忙，我也就早　看　了。說畢，將書包夾了一點，自向外走。心裏就繼續的　着，這樣看起來，我還度的是一種買賣式的婚姻。。假使我不好意思作聲，那我就讓他們把我賣了。倒是章唳天那種與我痛癢無關的人，還能用　誠的活來勸我。論到自己的一　謀生大路，要求得自己的終身幸福，只有臍離這家庭的　絆了。由這各方面去想着，把今天早上到學堂裏去，應當繞道避開章國　的原來計畫，就給忘了。依然還是順了天天到學堂裏去的原路走着。及至走到平常與國器相會的那條巷子裏，才猛然的省　，還是走到這個所亦來了。旣是來了，和他見面談一兩句話也好。由於今看起來，還是這樣以文字結交的人，比較靠得住。至少至少，他是能在文字上給人一種安慰的。於是把步子故意走得慢些，可是猶豫了脚，想了一想，也許他也有點顧忌，不肯走這條路。他旣是不走這條巷子，索興自己迎到另外一條巷子裏去。自己什麽也不用說，只是和他見一面，就能給他一種極大的安慰。（六一）</p>

<p>彼得Riedel博士之忠告及悲憤話　眞理只有一個切勿被偽科學所欺蒙</p>
<p>舊來醫界中，夙有「無藥愈淋」之呼聲，蓋已為週知之事實。製劑雖多，要不外檀香油　澄茄等配合而成。究其極，不過具有利尿消炎之局部效用。而彼等乃僭稱能透膜殺菌，夫縱使能達到透膜殺菌之目的，亦不過局部獲效，而尿道及生殖器粘膜之外，其蘊居身體各部之淋菌及毒素，斷乎不能剷除也。</p>
<p>以前因科學幼稚，無特效克淋製劑乃當然之事。近頃利學昌明，醫學日進千里，淋病變質治療之最新學說，于是得以確立。學者一致熱烈擁護，已成為淋病學理與治療上之權威！余在俄國習醫時，卽心折于此。自德國彼得Biedel博士採作藥物實騐後，乃以其特殊之化學成分配合調劑，製成克淋特效藥「克淋儂」。考此藥獨能增旺全　抗淋喰菌力之變質作用，實並世淋藥所望塵莫及。余迭在國內外採用此藥治男女急慢性各種淋濁白帶，及攝護腺睪丸炎（男性）陰道與子宮淋（女性）關節炎等重症，莫不應手而愈。連服六星期至最多十星期，即獲徹底除根。因購服者彌見踴躍，故以僞科學藥品仿胃「克淋儂」者極多。此層彼得氏在醫學週會中，已深致憤慨，會發表洋洋近萬字之勸吿病家書，茲應篇幅關係，不錄。總之，眞理只有一個，「克淋儂」以外，即無特效藥可尋也。</p>

<p>— 陸軍醫科大學宋宗鈺醫師</p>
<p>撲滅細菌：即所以根治白帶；白帶病療法之新趨勢</p>
<p>許多婦女界中之白帶，百分之七十，都由於細菌而起，細菌何以獨在女十　道活動，則因此部分粘膜潮潤，最合細菌繁殖之條件，但女子　道中亦另有一種陰道菌，專　外來細菌，苟此種陰道菌發育不良，與减少及消滅，則外界細菌得以乘之，因而破壞粘膜組織，遂為白帶病矣。若更由　道深入子宮與卵巢，即成子宮炎與卵巢炎。施治更深一層之困難。</p>
<p>在一般白帶病中，固可單「卡而雪地氏陰道片」以消炎防腐，殺菌消毒，並助長有益之陰道菌之繁殖。以根治白帶，若因白帶而起月經不調者，可服「補女容」以調整之。若因淋毒性白帶，則淋菌一物，深竄內部，「卡氏陰道片」有鞭長莫及之感。故除外用此片為坐藥外，必須內服「克淋儂」，以消除內部淋菌，依此治療，則淋毒性白帶，可指日收效矣。此為其他白帶藥所不能企及者也。</p>

<p>防癆必先化痰之原理　酸性藥雖能殺菌但能凝痰　反使癆菌籍痰塊以為障壁</p>
<p>肺臟不甚健壯之人，易為結核菌所俊據。一經侵據，病灶即行成立，倘平素痰多或自知肺弱之人，服此補肺特效藥，則雖有結核菌，亦無他處。否則病灶旣成，日漸擴大，由血行，淋巴流，延展至不堪收拾，斯為可慮！因結核菌外皮包有蠟質，富抗酸性，故市上一般藥物，均利用極强之酸性以頓挫菌體抵抗力。其實此類霸烈之藥，徒事誅伐無辜，而於結核菌則莫能損其毫末。蓋酸性物最能凝固痰液，欲求殺菌，必先化痰，不然菌在痰中，實無法可想矣。徒梅博士，乃費三十年之研究，考察結核菌之性質，而發明補肺特效藥「補肺拿爾」絕對避免霸道，採行剿撫兼施法，故對于滅癆抗菌，及治喀血咯痰，潮熱盜汗，食减胸痛，咳嗽身瘦，極有特效！因其善於除痰，故於久咳多痰，傷風咳嗽，小兒百日咳，老人哮喘，皆具卓騐。如患癆而兼有腦弱失眠，心悸健忘，婦女月經不調，男子腎萎早洩等，可分別兼服女用「補女容」或男用「補體康」以調經旺血，補腎生精，而獲健腦培虛，生機大盛，的服用五星　至八九星期，自覺效騐眞確。　（若男子有遺精精漏症，可並服「育精片」！）</p>

<p>快感消失之苦因何而成？</p>
<p>一般普通男女兩性，在靑春發育期，皆不免有自　（手淫）惡癖，此種惡癖，不僅在體健上有莫大妨礙，即性神經亦有莫大之損害，往往下部發育不全，有如未成人之小兒，而遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅等患，亦接踵而起，尤其在正當房事時，其快感每因性神經衰弱麻痹而致消失，此為一般靑年所引為最大之痛苦者。</p>
<p>患者恒覺精神疲勞，面色蒼白，唇爪無華，有如失血，其實此皆由自慰後所引起之血行障礙之貧血症也。頭目眩暈，心中苦煩，失眠不寐，女子則月經不調乳房臀部均欠肥圓之發育，萎黃病等等，均係此種自慰後之結果，又不僅快感消失，即子嗣亦發生問題也。</p>
<p>有住山西路之周雄君，年廿七歲，少年時發育本甚佳良，後忽被劣友引誘，致犯惡癖，旦旦而犯，性腺漸被受　，致結婚後之正常房事，亦乏快感，且有遺精失眠等症，結婚五年，從未有孕，歷服補腎固精之藥，亦寡效騐，後改投余處治療，經診查結果，發見性神經已十分衰弱，乃囑服大量「補體康」，以補腦生精，强化生殖系組織，而恢復性神經之功能，周君道余囑即往各藥房購服「補　康一至五星期，即獲全效，快感恢復，一如宋病之前云。至女子患此者，可服「補女容」。</p>

<h3 id="c177">未死以前的喪禮 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>美國南卡羅利拉州，有一位七十三歲的老太太，名呌奮奪培克，最近忽患重病，奄奄一息，她自度已無生望，所以要求把她的喪禮，提早在未死之前舉行，以便自己眞正能領受，在舉行喪禮之時，那位老太太，還作短短的演說，對於麥加喪禮的各位親友，深致感謝，舉行喪禮後之第三天，她果然死了，這樣一個喪禮，眞是聞所未聞，但我說這位老太太，眞是很有意思。</p>
<p>生死關頭，人莫能逃，至於已死，完全罔覺，無論子孫親友，怎樣的悲哀，怎樣的追悼，怎樣的盛禮，實與死者莫不相關，故從前滬上最轟動一時盛杏蓀大出喪，可稱為極一時之盛，然而當時卽有人說過，徜使那時盛杏蓀在棺材頭上坐着，或者另坐一乘馬車，（當時還沒有汽車）擺在道子當中走，方殺勝會，若人已死，此種舉動，原屬是空，祇見滿道子多是鈔票飛揚而已，</p>
<p>本來大出喪，大開吊，原是子孫輩做給他人看的，並不是對於死者眞正盡其孝思的舉動，這種舉動，本來有三個作用，一種是表示子孫對於父母祖先，怎樣的盡孝，一種藉此表示子孫怎樣的闊綽，一種表示子孫怎樣的多財，繁盛的喪禮，窮極奢侈，其結果不過若是而已，絕與死者無關。</p>
<p>平日任你怎樣的不孝，怎樣的忤逆，若父母一死，一定有不自殞滅，禍貽某親，及苫塊昏迷，臨表涕泣，不知所云的字句出來公吿於親友，這位老太太看穿此點，偏偏要生前享受，不要死後享受，這樣徹底的辦法，確是難得，她的意思，你們如果要做孝子，待我未死之先，做給我看，不婆死後做給別人看，如要盡親友的情誼，亦當在生前做給我看，不要死後做給人家看，這位老太太，眞有道理。</p>
<p>但是我說這個辦法，雖然是好，人旣未死，先來一個喪禮，到底有寅吃卯糧之嫌，在自己亦不好意思，我意與其開喪，不如做壽，想這位老太太在七十六十歲時，一定忘記了做毒方法，假定做壽，一樣可以使子孫盡其　一禮，一樣可以使賓朋滿座，一樣可以坐在中間受人家的賀禮，這不是大　　　，比較大做喪禮，有趣得多麽。</p>

<p>— 牧野</p>
<p>一有，有什麼了不起的仇恨麼？這麼打！聽聽……噢……天哪，作孽的，自己還不是夫婦倆嗎？……到底為了些啥呵？……這麽……」</p>
<p>年老的比得洛夫娜一面嚷着，她可就慌慌張張地跑下了三層樓梯，她跑到</p>
<p>們，……你們都見過嗎？夫婦倆個拚命扭在一起，那樣子，奥　像兩隻　狗似的廝咬着……那樣地……」比得洛夫娜她嘎聲的向大家嚷着，她張大了眼睛，她又不時的把頭狠狠地低下從老花鏡的邊沿上向大家掃射着淡淡地目光像要搜尋一個什麼人似的；兩隻手為了過度刺激的原故在胸前劇烈的抽動着，抽動着，有時緊緊地抓着自己的衣服，一把一把的往下扯着些什麽；她底臉色也都蒼白了，「……那樣地打……噢……作孽的，我去勸也不成功，反而給他們火上添了油。……那個喝得爛醉了的巴希金一隻手狠勁兒的抓着安麗娜那漂亮的頭髮……這樣地……這樣地……他那另一隻手握成了一個可怕的拳頭，一下一下的往她的背上槌着，……像是在打鼓！噢！……那個可憐的安麗娜呵，她向他打着，可是，……她是多麽的無力呵！……她不會給那兇暴的巴希金半點痛苦的戚覺呵！……你們，……聽聽！……這就是……這……」</p>
<p>於是大家順着比得洛夫娜的視綫，把眼光集中在三樓的玻璃窗上，這又能看得見什麽呢？只聽得撲登撲登的拳頭打在肉上，和凌亂而重濁的脚步的聲響，大家都緊張的向上仰視，有的也在晒台上探出了腦袋。這裏，比得洛夫娜像一陣旋風似的在每一個人的面前掠過，後來，她又慌慌張張的跑回那所小樓去了。</p>
<p>不消一會工夫，比得洛夫娜就又跑下來了，她臉上充滿了喜悅，她說：噢！……仁慈的上帝！……上帝賜給他們幸福，——他們又和好如初了！……」說着，在胸前畫着十字。</p>
<p>這眞是一個有趣的羅宋老太婆呵！</p>
<p>因為我才搬入了碩村，所以我對於這在以前是陌生的羅宋人，特別的感到了興趣，我曾經在有閒的時候仔細的觀察他們，他們那羅宋人特有的面孔異的鼻頭，有的女人尙穿着半舊的紅顏綠色的服裝……這一切都給了我新的刺激。幾十年前，他們不都是華貴的王族來麽？他們的王族的尊嚴也都打得粉碎了。</p>
<p>後來，漸漸地，我便和那和善的老女人比得洛夫娜成了朋友，有一天我問起了巴希金夫婦的事，她便滔滔地和一切所有的老太婆似的嘮嘮叨叨的講了：</p>
<p>「咳！……作孽的，這眞沒法講呵，這……。不曉得怎樣的上帝聽從了魔鬼的話，把我們這些人趕出了俄羅斯的土地，把一切都交給了粗野的工人，憨子的農人，和一切陴賤的東西……噢！</p>
<p>您曉得，我們都是些王族，聖尼古拉的親眷，我們以前都不要做什麽事情，甚至於走路，……可是現在，要自己來給自謀生活了！這在我們是一種苦刑呵……那裏能夠呵！……</p>
<p>巴西金，可憐的巴西金夫婦呵！…………他從來沒有過職業，把自己的年老的姆媽遺下的錢用完了便永遠墮入窮困之中了呵！……上帝賜給了他個暴戾的個性。飲酒，狂賭，……還有個不該再有的驕傲，噢！這個可憐的年靑人呵！</p>
<p>不知道在那一天開始，他們便失掉了早餐，……後來，有時整天的得不到吃一點什麼東西，連一小薄片黑麵色都沒得吃了！巴希金就發瘋的槌打他的妻子安麗娜，……那樣地，他像是在和她决力！這是怎麼了呵？</p>
<p>借貸是不成功，每個人都不會給人些須的帮助的！</p>
<p>一天夜裏，巴希金沒回來，我到晒台上去乘風凉的時候，在他的房問裏洋溢着一個男子的笑聲！作孽的，我……請上帝饒恕我，我就那樣的在鎖孔裏偷着看了，呵！……個，一個陌生的男子在抱着那美麗的安麗娜呵！……鬼知道，她們是做了些什麽事情阿！……後來……後來就常有些陌生的男人給安麗娜睡在一起了，……可憐的巴希金有時在寂寞的街上伴着黑夜度過一個整晚呵。……安麗娜那裏高興這麽作呵！有時自己羞惱的哭了……作孽的巴希金還把那不易得來的錢都喝了酒</p>
<p>咳……差不多隔幾天要打一次架的，那便是安麗娜的不容易的得來的錢給他用完了！……」</p>
<p>可是，日子過了不久，美麗的安麗娜不見了，那自然也不再打架了！後來我聽見比得洛夫娜講：「大概是給他賣掉了呵！</p>

<p>— 程修揚</p>
<p>下了一陣雨，成羣的　蜓在天空中打盤旋，鄰居的孩子們用蒲扇紮在竹竿的頂端，往來爭撲，於是我想起我家的長工阿福來。</p>
<p>阿福捕捉蜻蜓有特別的技巧，他捉來後，用紗線縛着它的頭，總是一連串十幾個，因為互相牽制着，飛起來很好看的。阿福在我腦海中始終不能忘去，大概就是這個原因了。</p>
<p>他為人爽直，孔武有力，做事從來不偷懶，田里的工作之外，種菜，挑水，他都肯做，而且不必我們關照他。他每天從起身到睡覺，黃昏時候喜歡在塲角落里喝幾口麥酒，就沒有休息的時候。記得有一年過年，結算工資的時候，祖父笑着告訴他。</p>
<p>「阿福，你現在已經有三十多塊錢了，我替你凑足四十塊放利息，將來娶了媳婦好好做份人家。」</p>
<p>阿福低着頭稱謝了，然後低低地說出他的心願：</p>
<p>「老爺，買一塊墳地要多少錢？我爸還沒有葬呢。」</p>
<p>從此孝子阿福在鎭上呌出名了。但是伙伴們時常和他開玩笑：</p>
<p>「阿福，辛辛苦苦做長工，不娶個媳婦樂兒，要替爸買墳地，眞是好孩子。」</p>
<p>說着拍拍阿福的堅實的背脊，彷彿老子愛憐他的兒似的。</p>
<p>「阿福，娶媳婦也是做孝子呵，你聽見師爺（塾師）說嗎？不孝有三，無後為大。」另一個伙伴得意地唸出兩句斯文來，頭兒打着圈，還恐怕阿福不懂，解釋着：「你爸養了你，你也應該養個兒子傳種。懂　？那才是孝子。」</p>
<p>那個伙伴更用手指做着穢褻的舉動。</p>
<p>阿福像一尊彌勒似的盤膝坐在塲角落里，手裏擎着一個麥瓶的小瓶，嘴對嘴的灌着，一邊在衣袋里掏着蠶荳剝來吃。聽見伙伴們在取笑他，他　了一口痰</p>
<p>一不要臉的！阿福對着那個伙伴說：「媳婦兒，媳婦兒，晚上抱個枕頭取樂兒罷！</p>
<p>在花田（棉花）里，河灘邊，常常有年輕的漢子向姑娘們調笑，四句頭山歌（鄉下情歌）嘹亮地此唱彼和，一種本能」的慾望在鄉下是徹頭徹尾毫無顧忌的。阿福却總是裝着一付正經面孔從來沒有向姑娘們說一句笑話的。</p>
<p>祖父就私下許了阿福一個心願，他積着工錢買墳地葬父親，祖父預備留意着一個好姑娘帮助他做一份人家。但是不幸在大革命的漩渦里我家遭了搶劫，房屋被地痞流氓放火燒了，祖父不及逃避，遭難而亡。亂事平靜後，我家的　地都變了姓，自然也僱佣不起長工，阿福到城里去找事情的時候，他對我父親說；</p>
<p>少爺將來種田的時候，阿福還是要來做長工的。」</p>
<p>父親祇有苦笑。阿福在我們家裏已經像家人一樣了，我更是捨不得他突然離開，父親最後送了他幾個零錢，悽然地說：</p>
<p>阿福，老爺許你的事祇有落空了，你好好到城裏找份主子，將來總得要娶了媳婦兒的。」</p>
<p>阿福到城裏沒有一年，消息傳來，他娶了個寡婦，被蟻媒串騙了他積着買墳地葬父親的辛苦錢。父親聽着嘆氣說：「城裏不是個好地方！」</p>
<p>那件事到現在已有二十年光景了。去年家裏來信說阿福又回到鎭上來了，他已完全變了模樣，二十年的生活壓迫使他完全變了模樣，常常向父親强借錢，或者偷東西去挨酒吃。八月里捉花（採棉花）的時候，他在田里强姦一個小姑娘，被鎭上綁着送到城里去，被判監禁十二年。</p>
<p>一個討厭女人的孝子阿福，終於犯了强姦罪被監禁起來，我永遠想不透他的矛盾的犯罪原因，我想有個機會回鄕下去看他一次。</p>

<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>六月的下午，太陽像一顆炸彈在天空爆烈開來，石子路蒸發着焦臭的氣息，這是大都市角落里的一條狹小的街道</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，有三五輛黃包車走過到車廠去交班，一羣赤裸着上下身的孩子在街心穿　着，點綴着追零落的市面。</p>
<p>這街上惟一的大店舖，是孫二胖子的肉店，他慣例地過了中午就歇市，其實下午再沒有一個主顧上他店門來做三五百文的生意了。他把破舊的籐椅放在屋擔下，敞開了生着黑毛的胸脯，睡他的中覺了。</p>
<p>生意最忙的要算朱猴子的烟兌店，三個銅子火油，一枚香姻匣換二支烟，從早上開市到上牌門，他的店前總是有着主顧上上下下的。作者特別寫出這兩家店舖，因為它們是這狹小的街道上最出色的門面了，此外都是傾斜着的矮屋，身材比較高大的人走過的時候，他的頭部是懸在屋頂上的。</p>
<p>但是朱猴子總是羨慕孫二胖子福氣好，一天祇做早上幾個鐘頭，就安安穩穩　中覺了，自己却像名字一樣在店堂里跳上跳卞，他用手指一掄，——十五點鐘。下午該是比較淸閑的時候，但他不能在櫃台上打個瞌睡，或者離開店舖幾分鐘，這家量出色的烟兌店還沒有僱用一個起碼的伙計。</p>
<p>現在不是又有主顧上門嗎？那是個穿着醬色破軍服的中年兵士，他丟了一枚銅子，買二支「本店出品」的烟捲。他似乎已經幾天沒有抽烟捲了，燃着火就一口氣燒去了大半支，但是鼻子里沒有一絲靑烟噴出；又一口，一支烟已燒着他的手指了。他對朱猴子瞥了一眼，免强地做了個笑臉，但是誰也不知道他笑的理由。</p>
<p>「老闆」，他終於開口了：「有一伴東西要　？」</p>
<p>朱猴子對他望着，他很驚異那兵士或許是個神經病患者，又提防他突然一個虎跳跨進　台來搶東西，朱猴子是有過那種經騐的。但是不，他向街中巡視了一週，從褲腰里掏出一牧金錶來放在櫃台上。</p>
<p>「老闆，我沒有錢用，這錶强點賣脫。</p>
<p>朱猴子的眼珠在眼腔里轉着，他知道那兵士是什麽「路數」，他把錶搶過來放到耳朶上一聽，聲音走得挺響，外面的壳子在太陽光下閃着金彩，朱猴子知道卽不是個金的，也是個好錶。</p>
<p>「賣多少？」像當舖里朝奉的口氣。</p>
<p>「老闆，隨你給幾個錢？」那兵士又免强笑着？「我已兩天沒有抽烟了！」</p>
<p>他見老闆呆着彷彿不懂他的話，馬上又補充了一句：</p>
<p>「兩天沒有抽大烟了！」</p>
<p>朱猴子心里眞笑開了花，這筆意外的賣買抵得半個月生意，但是他故意把錶端詳着，又撬開來察看里面的機伴，一邊搖着頭：</p>
<p>「不行！里面的機件都調走了。」一個內行似的，「六毛錢放在我這里吧。」</p>
<p>這時候那羣孩子忽然看到那兵士了，「一個兵」他們喊着慢慢地走迎朱猴子的店舖來，使他更侷促不安起來。</p>
<p>「老闆，再加一點，這錶當也好當兩塊錢。——嘻嘻，老闆是明白人，隨意加一點。</p>
<p>朱猴子把錶緊緊抓在手里，他思量着快點打發他走路，兩塊錢無論如何不會吃虧，那羣孩子看到了要瞎說瞎話的，他回過身來在鎖着的銀箱中揀了二張鈔票，又回到　台上授給了他，一邊故意提高了說：</p>
<p>「噲，兩支香烟。」</p>
<p>那兵士接了鈔票，匆促地塞進腰包，向街心走去了。</p>
<p>朱猴子這天提早歇市，在燈下把金錶玩賞了半天，才踅到孫二胖子舖里看打五百鏟。</p>
<p>「小猴子今天早啊。」孫二　起座來</p>
<p>朱猴子見是時機到了，他故意緩緩地縱胸袋里掏出那個金錶，一看時針還是指在五點鐘上，他馬上放到耳朶上，一點聲音也沒有，用力搖着，祇聽見像自來水龍頭滴水似的走幾下又停了。朱猴子一時急得漲紅了臉，二張鈔票在他眼前幌着，他援脚跑出孫二胖子的店門，他想去追那個殺頭的兵士回來。</p>
<p>街燈糢糊的吊在電桿上，穿着竄着的孩子都不見了，朱猴子像跌在冰窖里一樣，兩塊錢，兩塊錢，他幾乎要哭了</p>

<p>聯華本年鉅製，蔡楚生繼「漁光曲」之又一傑作，「迷途的羔羊」，現在上海金城大戲院首次公映該片，籌備年餘，攝製一載，用資　十數萬，而成績之優，聲勢之大，實為國片所未有，茲將該片比較重要演員所飾角色及其性格寫述於下，觀此可知本片情節之動人，體魄之偉大也。</p>
<p>葛佐治飾小三子一個良善的，農村的窮孩子，他有着熱情和正義感；但他和一般的中國人一樣，患着懦怯，在使人更加愚蠢的農村敎育中，他變成一個頑童；又因為天災人禍的煎迫，使他流落成為一個街頭野蠻的孩子；但他多少還保持着良善的本質，雖然他每天都在悲慘的生活中打轉。</p>
<p>陳娟娟飾翠兒一個農村裏沒有敎養的野女孩子，表面上是勇敢，潑刺，而又任性，但她的內心却蘊藏着一股女性特具的熱烈的柔情，她和佐治有着同樣的遭遇，但環境並不曾使他的本性變質。</p>
<p>黎灼灼飾沈　　　一個崇拜所謂現代文明的都市女性，具有蛇一般的魅惑；在物質享樂和某一種不能使她饜足的環境中，她不斷在尋求新的刺激，她的生活是糜爛的而又矛盾。</p>
<p>鄭君里飾老僕一個熱情而又神經質的老僕，他有着所謂「忠肝義胆」，也有着所謂「古道熱腸」，由於生活環境所决定，他的短視，使他祗能够接觸到事實的浮面，而沒有能力去作進一步的批判，——這中間就形成了他的淺薄和矛盾，而終於幻滅了，他的存在，或者會有，或者不會有；但他是作者假設的人物，用來說明「迷途的羔羊」這一問題，並不是從人道主義的立塲上所能够得到解决的事情，却是沒有疑　的。</p>
<p>沈百寗飾沈慈航他是一個所謂識時務的「俊傑」，由於他的長袖善舞，造成他在都會中被崇拜為「萬家生佛」的地位；然而事實他却是一個「？」，儘管他在外表上裝得如何「高貴莊嚴」，私生活却是一般地不堪聞問！——一個具有兩重人格的滑稽人物。</p>
<p>章志直飾保鏢　一個某種人所　養的功狗，在他的記憶裏沒有正義，失掉了畫魂，惟靠兇殘來維持他的衣食，是一個「助紂為虐」的典型人物。</p>
<p>殷秀岑飾送包飯者　小市民層中的可憐蟲，生活充滿了灰色，被「上流人」所不齒；但當他在萬分偶然的機會中，變做一個所謂暴發戶以後，就是「上流人」結交惟恐不及的「財神」了！他永遠不願意提起「寒酸」的往事，因為他再也不是「爛大塊頭」，而是有着「福相」！</p>
<p>秦海郵飾頑童　是鄉村不良敎育所製造出來的標準人物——頑皮而狡黠，他以破壞他人的行為為快意的舉動，——他有天賦的聰明，但這聰明是被引到魔道上去了。</p>
<p>王干淸飾小　嘴　一個掙扎在饑餓綫上的流浪兒，每天，每時，每刻，他都沒有飯吃，每天，每時，每刻，他都想把眼睛所看見的食物，放到自己的肚子裏去——這習慣有時使它佔便宜，有時也使他吃大虧。——一個息生活的習慣病者。</p>
<p>洪警鈴飾敎書匠　三家村土地廟裏的猢猻王——冬烘先生——生活的枯寂，使他更深明「敎不嚴，師之惰。」的「明訓」；但他常因衰老而　睡頻仍，就不免「閉聰塞明」，毆及無辜。以師長的「尊嚴」，竟因此被狡黠的學童們當做戲弄的對象。</p>
<p>李君磬飾校長　一個道貌岸然。儼然以維持風化自居的校長，他是御用敎育的執行人，特殊階級的歌頌者。</p>
<p>劉瓊飾任特猛一都會中的所謂靑年紳士，備具着種種取悅於異性的條件，他是所謂摩登淑女們追求的對象，也是她們用來消遣有閑歲月的玩物。溫容飾小三子之父　一個輾轉於悲慘生活中的農人，耐勞而剛直；但他愚昧。最　他是在個人的反抗行　之下，像一條微蟲似的　滅了。</p>
<p>黃筠貞飾貴婦人　好管閑事的所謂貴族命婦，趨炎赴熱是她唯一的本能，因此有時會失態地忘却她本來的「身份」。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Guangxi Air Force Captain Deng Zixiang and Others Issue Circular Telegram <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Deng Zixiang, captain of the 3rd team of the Guangxi Air Force, and others flew to Guangdong to surrender to the Central Government. They issued a circular telegram on the 15th, the original text of which is as follows (titles omitted):</p>
<p>"Everyone, please note: The nation is in dire peril. Anyone with patriotic ideals and a basic understanding of national defense could not bear to destabilize the central government and hasten our demise. This incident in Guangdong and Guangxi was initiated by Guangxi. Fortunately, the air force comrades in Guangdong were stirred to righteous indignation and staged a series of mutinies, eventually taking away the momentum of the warlords and quelling the unrest in Guangdong. The Guangxi authorities, observing the international crisis and listening to the appeals of the people, should have abandoned their butcher knives and redeemed their past sins. However, when the central government leniently issued a new order, they resisted stubbornly. When the people advised them to lay down their arms, they prepared for war. They pretended to negotiate peacefully but secretly planned scorched-earth resistance. The envoys running back and forth sought to perish with them, sacrificing everything for their own selfishness. Now that the situation in Guangxi is precarious, Li Bai still relies on a desperate measure: they believe that the soldiers of the province have sworn an oath in blood and are willing to be their loyal followers. However, such outdated feudal practices are intended to fool the Guangxi army. We can only swear allegiance to the Party and its principles. Any other oath, if not made freely when joining, is worthless. Furthermore, the Guangxi authorities' false mask has been exposed, and their conspiracy has failed. They are now trying to collude with the communists to survive, abandoning their principles and advocating communism. Therefore, regardless of their actions, such borrowing of popular opinion and sudden reversals will inevitably lead to collapse. If, at this point, they do not sincerely seek a bright future for the nation and the people under a single belief, they are courting their own destruction. Zixiang and others are soldiers whose duty is to defend the territory. We are ashamed to be tools for personal sacrifice. Therefore, on the 14th of this month, we voluntarily flew to Guangdong to await the Central Government's commands, to demonstrate our advocacy of unification and national salvation and to urge Li Bai to awaken. Our Guangxi comrades have always been second to none in loving the country. They should rise up together to save the nation from danger and revitalize the nation. This is the time to act. We send this telegram for your consideration."</p>
<p>Deng Zixiang, Captain of the 3rd Team of the Guangxi Air Force; Li Yifei, Deputy Captain; Liang Weiru, Platoon Leader; Luo Shumin, Pilot; all bow in respect. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Reorganizing Guangdong Province's Finances; Implementation Methods Have Been Agreed Upon; Division of Central and Local Taxes <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After Song Ziliang assumed office as the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance, he decided to abolish the first batch of exorbitant taxes amounting to 13 million yuan. He has now submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance regarding this work. The Ministry of Finance has sent personnel to various counties to investigate the types of taxes. Once the investigation is completed, a report will be issued and the taxes will be abolished. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The agricultural specialty tax bureau established by Chen Jitang in Guangdong Province was originally one of the exorbitant taxes. Recently, more than ten counties, including Shantou, Chaozhou, and Meizhou, as well as the GuangZhao hometown associations in Shanghai and other places, have successively petitioned the Ministry of Finance to order the Guangdong Department of Finance to abolish it in order to alleviate the people's suffering. The Ministry of Finance, considering that Guangdong Province is actively working on abolishing exorbitant taxes, immediately instructed the Guangdong Department of Finance to handle the matter concurrently. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Wu Qiding, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, arrived in the province by plane from Xun on the 16th to urge the improvement of the Guangdong tax system. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) Guling telephone: After the Guangdong situation was clarified, the Central Government considered the past financial situation of the province to be extremely chaotic and the people to be suffering. It immediately dispatched Vice Minister of Finance Lin and special commissioner to investigate and plan for several days, and some progress has been made. Song then came to Guling from Guangdong to seek instructions from Minister Kong on everything. At that time, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan, advisor Chen Guangfu, Vice President of the Central Bank Chen Xing, Director of the Taxation Department Wu Qiding, and President of the Bank of China Bei Songsun also came to Guling at the summons to discuss the matter in multiple meetings. A Central News Agency reporter visited the Ministry of Finance office on the 16th to inquire about the reorganization of Guangdong's provincial finances. An individual kindly provided detailed answers to each question. The question-and-answer session is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Has the division of central and local taxes in Guangdong Province been completely determined? What are the principles and content?</p>
<p>(Answer) The standards for the division of central and local taxes have long been stipulated by the Central Government, and all provinces have consistently followed them. Guangdong Province should also follow the aforementioned division standards.</p>
<p>(Question) How many types of exorbitant taxes have been abolished in Guangdong Province? How many are planned to be abolished?</p>
<p>(Answer) Exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies in Guangdong Province should be abolished as soon as possible to alleviate the people's suffering. When Chairman Zou and special commissioner Song were dispatched to Guangdong, they had already formulated principles and instructed them to investigate, clarify, and eliminate the taxes separately. Detailed lists will be announced later.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the budget of Guangdong Province? Will it still need central government subsidies in the future?</p>
<p>(Answer) The revenue and expenditure budget of Guangdong Province is currently being reviewed and prepared by Director Song. If special matters arise in the future that exceed the local financial capacity, the Central Government will consider the actual situation and provide assistance by allocating central government tax revenues to the area, as in previous cases.</p>
<p>(Question) Has the issue of the foreign rice tax been resolved?</p>
<p>(Answer) It has been resolved.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the content of the Guangdong currency system reorganization plan?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Guangdong Provincial and Municipal Banks have privately issued nickel notes, with the outstanding amount reaching more than 250 million yuan to date. Among them, 80 million yuan were newly issued in June and July of this year and were privately withdrawn by the former authorities of the province, amounting to a huge sum of 30 million yuan. As for reserves, there are only 10.07 million yuan in silver cash reserves, accounting for 4.3% of the total issuance. Although 92 million yuan in provincial treasury bonds have been allocated as guarantee reserves, these treasury bonds currently have no market price or credit and cannot be considered reliable. Therefore, each yuan of nickel note is only worth 43 cents in silver. In other words, 2.3 yuan of nickel notes is only worth 1 yuan of silver. The lack of reserves and the low value are evident. In order to show consideration for the people of Guangdong Province and demonstrate the Central Government's benevolence, the Ministry has dispatched Director Xu along with Director Song to Guangdong to investigate the facts and formulate reorganization measures to stabilize Guangdong's finances and develop the economy.</p>
<p>(Question) When will the Central Bank branch be established?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Central Bank is currently sending personnel to investigate the local financial situation and prepare everything. It should be established soon.</p>
<p>(Question) How will the salt tax system in Guangdong Province be improved?</p>
<p>(Answer) In recent years, Guangdong Province abolished the names of fishing and salt taxes, ordering fishermen to use edible salt and imposing particularly heavy taxes, which is not the case in other regions. In addition, there are various additional charges. The fishing and salt tax rate will now be reduced to 50 cents per 100 catties, and other charges such as salt allowances will be abolished to alleviate the people's suffering. We will also thoroughly reorganize the contractors to ensure tax revenue and reduce expenditures to save public funds. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Central Meteorological Observatory news: The typhoon reached Dongsha Island on the afternoon of the 16th, located between 117 degrees east longitude and 21 degrees north latitude. The wind force reached its highest level, moving northwest-west. Within 24 hours, it will make landfall south of Hong Kong, and there will be strong winds and rain in southern Guangdong Province. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Observatory hoisted the No. 5 signal, indicating that the typhoon will come from the northwest and the wind force will be very strong. (16th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Income Tax; Ministry of Finance Prepares to Levy <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance is preparing to levy income tax, and all procedures are underway. The principle for local tax collection agencies has been decided: they will be handled concurrently by the tax authorities. However, to ensure responsibility, it is rumored that a committee will be formed in various places, with the candidates nominated by local impartial gentry, local authorities, and experts appointed by the Ministry. The Central Direct Tax Preparatory Office believes that the people in various localities do not fully understand the tax collection methods and their significance, so it has drafted a letter from the Central Government to the citizens of the whole country regarding the implementation of income tax, which will be announced before the levy begins. Regarding the payment of income tax by foreigners in China, people from various countries in China feel that the tax rate is very low and easy to pay, so they are quite sympathetic. The procedures for collection and reporting have been discussed once by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance. When the Income Tax Law is implemented, a notice will be issued to start collecting taxes at the same time. As for the recent telegram from Shanghai industry and commerce to the Ministry of Finance requesting that the full salary income be changed to a starting point of 50 yuan, it is understood that the current Income Tax Law has been passed by the Legislative Yuan. Whether it needs to be amended will depend on the decision of the Legislative Yuan. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Song Zheyuan's Remarks: The Sui East Dispute Will Not Escalate; The Sui Army Has Strong Combat Power and Bandits Are Not Enough to Defeat Them; It Is Reported That Fu Zuoyi Personally Visited Pingdiquan to Inspect <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan summoned Qin Decun, Chen Jiqing, Deng Zhexi, and others at his private residence this morning to inquire about the military and political situation in Beiping. He then met with reporters and said that the Hebei Provincial Security Command held a security conference, and he went to Baoding to give instructions. The important content was to strictly prohibit opium. Afterwards, he inspected the troops stationed in Baoding and went to Renqiu to inspect the shooting range of officers above the company commander. The purpose of this tour was to rectify officialdom, clear up backlog cases. Hebei Province's three-year prison grain reached 2 million yuan, and he has ordered various agencies to clear up military cases immediately. He decided to implement two things absolutely this year in Baoding: one is to reorganize additional taxes in the province. In the future, the additional tax on land tax shall not exceed four yuan at most. The other is to reorganize the militia security team, eliminate communist elements, train and organize them. The recent dispute in Sui East is due to the trouble caused by bandits on the border of Chahar and Suiyuan. Because the Sui army has strong combat capabilities, the bandits are not enough to defeat them. Fu Zuoyi visited Pingdiquan to inspect. This time will not escalate. Wang Kemin has no definite date to come north. He has not talked about the chairman of the Economic and Trade Commission recently. There has been no contact with Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China recently. Whether Ambassador Kawagoe came to North China with the mission of discussing economic issues in North China is unknown. Regarding the construction of the Cangshi Road, he intends to accept local investment, which must be carried out on the principles of fairness and mutual benefit. Detailed methods are still being studied and there is no decision yet. Regarding the election of representatives to the National Assembly, because the environment in Hebei Province is special, the facts should be taken into account and the local area should not be affected. It has not been determined yet. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There have been many conflicting rumors recently that Li Shouxin's bandit troops in Suidong and Chabei are planning to cause trouble again. A reporter visited Ba Wenjun, the director of the office of the SuiMongol Local Autonomy Political Council in Beijing, to inquire about the situation. According to him, the current situation in the five counties of Suidong (four leagues of the right wing) is still safe, according to the telegram he received. Director Da (Damiling Sulong) telegraphed yesterday that Li Shouxin and other bandits in Shangdu were intending to cause trouble again. Sui strictly defended and severely attacked them, and they have now retreated to Shangdu, and the local area is peaceful. Ba said that the previous erroneous report that Director Da had been arrested can now prove to be inaccurate. The Great Lama of Xigong Banner suddenly led more than 100 people to attack Prince Shi's mansion when Prince Shi was unprepared. It was still an old dispute. However, Prince Shi will soon be able to return to Xigong Banner. The Mongolian Political Council has now decided to hold the second general meeting on the 20th of this month after holding the general meeting this spring. Director Yan Xishan will send personnel to attend for guidance. He himself will not go to Sui to attend because of business. The meeting will be held in the provincial capital of Suiyuan. The main cases to be discussed are: 1. Resolving the Xigong Banner dispute. 2. Building the council site. 3. Major cases such as the construction, education, health, and development of wool products in the territory of the SuiMongol Local Autonomy Political Council. Regarding health facilities, the Executive Yuan has now ordered the Ministry of Health to handle them in a unified manner. The principles of construction and education cases have also been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (16th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e13">America's Peaceful Diplomacy <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In diplomatic terms, since America issued a protest to Japan on behalf of the Nine-Power Treaty, and not receiving any results, it has kept an extreme silence regarding the development of international aggression and violence. From the surface, it seems that America has returned to the Monroe Doctrine, not asking or listening to the situation in Europe and Asia. Actually, a positive character is hidden in this kind of passive form.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt recently delivered a moving speech on foreign policy at the Chautauqua Summer Conference in the state of New York. He said, "The condition of the international world is more concerning and less pleasing than the recent prospects of the United States." It can be seen that the United States is extremely concerned about all of its interests in investment and trade around the world. He also stated America's efforts to maintain world peace, and said very earnestly that the reason why America is temporarily ignoring the events of international peace disruption is because eliminating the wars of various countries is really beyond the capabilities of the United States.</p>
<p>To more clearly understand the passive form of American foreign policy, one can quote the words of American political commentator Harris. Although he was speaking specifically about the Far East issue, the true meaning of America's entire foreign policy can be gleaned from this aspect. According to Harris, "In the past, America's protests did not impress the Japanese because America's naval power was only sufficient to protect the Hawaiian Islands and did not reach the coast of Japan. Only by expanding the strength of the navy until the United States has maritime superiority can the matters that America wants to protest in diplomacy be prevented from happening."</p>
<p>The policy currently adopted by the United States is clearly Harris's proposal. Wilson's large-scale shipbuilding plan has already been implemented. According to recent telegraphic reports, the United States has decided to build twelve destroyers and six submarines within three months and to build a large dock at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.</p>
<p>This kind of naval expansion is the same as the Soviet Union's increased defense in the Far East against the Japanese army, forcing the Japanese navy to expand at an accelerated rate. The excessive expansion of the Japanese army and navy has already created a domestic economic crisis and will only deepen the crisis. Before the economic crisis awakens Japan to world peace, the rulers of Japan will undoubtedly use ruthless means to intensify their proactive actions against our country.</p>
<p>We, who bear the brunt of the crisis, of course, take the same attitude as the United States in maintaining world peace. We should completely channel our limited strength into the mainstream of the world's peaceful forces. Only in this way can we make the intellect and conscience of international violent actors re-dominate their ambitions.</p>

<p>(London) Yesterday afternoon, Britain and France finalized the full text of the agreement on France's proposal of non-intervention in Spain. The two governments exchanged notes in Paris as proof. The agreement will take effect after Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia respond with their approval. It is reported that the Soviet government is quite supportive.

The British government is now assisting the French government in urging Rome for a response. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British government has accepted the draft agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war proposed by France. Sir Eric Phipps, the British Ambassador to France, submitted the formal reply of his government to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon, stating that the agreement will take effect immediately after the governments of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Portugal agree to participate. Political figures here have expressed great satisfaction with Britain's decision, saying that Russia and Portugal have already submitted replies expressing their support for the French proposal. Therefore, the reference to the "governments of the four countries" in the British reply is directed at Germany and Italy, containing a direct appeal to the two countries. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office issued a public statement this evening, stating that "Regarding the original draft agreement on non-intervention proposed by France, which advocates that all signatory countries should not sell various munitions, military and civilian aircraft, and various warships to Spain or Spanish Morocco, Britain and France have now fully reached an agreement. The two governments exchanged notes in Paris this afternoon. This agreement will take effect immediately after the governments of Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Portugal agree to participate." It is now learned that the Soviet government has expressed its support for this agreement, and the Portuguese government has also accepted the principle of non-intervention. However, Germany and Italy have not yet submitted a final response. The French government is currently in contact with Italy, and the British government is providing strong support to facilitate its success. (Havas dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the British government formally replied expressing its support for the draft agreement on non-intervention proposed by France, Britain and France have thus reached an agreement. The newspapers here commented on this matter, hoping that Germany and Italy would change their attitude so that the non-intervention agreement could be realized as soon as possible. "Le Journal" published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, claiming that the German reply was ready and that its content expressed agreement with the French draft. However, according to a telegram from the "Le Matin" in Berlin, the German government has decided not to respond to the French proposal for the time being. The extreme right-wing "Deutsche Tageszeitung" adopted the views of the Italian newspapers, saying that "The reason why the proposal put forward by France has failed to achieve the expected results is that, although this proposal sounds very appealing on the surface, when one examines its substance, some of the actions that our country's authorities should be directly responsible for are obviously contradictory to their statements. For example, the number of domestic donations for the Spanish Red Army is increasing, and communist members continue to enlist and go to Spain to join the military. Some cabinet members even openly support one of the two warring factions in Spain. All these situations are clear to everyone, and Britain, Germany, and Italy are all aware of them." The newspaper concluded by saying that the Secretary-General of the Unified Trade Union, Shi Wu, flew to Pasaia Port in Spain yesterday, and the purpose of this is difficult to understand. Gairnu, Chairman of the Left-wing Human Rights League, wrote an article in "Le Petit Journal" attacking domestic right-wing figures, saying, "They always talk about respecting justice and the law, but they praise the Spanish rebels who launched a coup to overthrow the legitimate government, which is self-contradictory. The reason why they adopt this attitude is largely because they hate the democratic system." Other newspapers, such as "L'Intransigeant", expressed concern about the recruitment of soldiers by the Spanish revolutionary army in French Morocco, saying that the French government must stop it.

<p>Lisbon. The city of Badajoz, Spain, after fierce fighting between the two armies, was occupied by the rebel army on Friday evening. The truth about the destruction and terror within has been detailed to our agency today by a Portuguese reporter. This is the first journalist to enter the city after its fall. It is said that the rebel army commander who allowed him to enter the city warned him that this trip was extremely dangerous and instructed him to pay special attention to the seven Moorish troops patrolling the streets, as these soldiers were still very excited. The reporter also said that the undamaged parts of Badajoz were in a state of chaos. Every street was filled with obstacles. In fact, almost every obstacle was a pile of corpses. The walls in front of the military headquarters were splattered with blood, and bullet holes were as dense as a beehive. This is the trace of the more than two thousand people killed by the rebel army. When the reporter spoke with Colonel Yiyi, who is currently ruling Badajoz, he mentioned that more than two thousand people had been executed. Yiyi actually said, "What you said is very good, but the number of people killed may not be so many." It is said that women are often seen searching for their husbands and children in the piles of corpses in the streets, a situation that could not be more tragic. These orphans and widows are truly pitiful creatures in this barbaric civil war. According to a Spanish captain, the fall of Badajoz was due to a simultaneous attack from both sides. The battle lasted for forty-eight hours. When the Red Army fought, they were as brave as lions. Each army charged with bayonets, and their bravery was unprecedented since the formation of the militia. (Reuters dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<p>Elvas, Portugal. After the city of Badajoz, Spain, was occupied by the revolutionary army of that country a few days ago, our reporter made a special trip to inspect it. The city of Badajoz is the capital of the province of Badajoz, a famous fortress. The province of Badajoz is the largest province in Spain's fifty-one provinces. The railway from the capital Madrid to Lisbon, Portugal, passes through it. The population is dense, and the area is prosperous. As soon as the reporter entered the city yesterday, he saw blood splattered all over the streets. The magnificent bullring and all public buildings have been reduced to rubble. The desolation is like the sky from the earth compared to the past. According to military figures, since the revolutionary army entered the city, hundreds of Marxists have been shot. The captured left-wing workers were all lined up against the walls of the city's cathedral and shot. The reporter saw piles of corpses at the foot of the wall, and there were also two next to the altar. However, the church was not damaged. More than three hundred right-wing figures in the prisons were released. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>

The city of Oviedo, occupied by the rebels in the north, is still heavily surrounded by the Asturian miners' militia. President Azaña recently ordered that the rebel cruisers "España" and "Velasco" be declared pirate ships, and anyone who sees them should immediately bombard them without leniency.

General Triana, commander of the Southern Route of the revolutionary army, issued a broadcast report yesterday, advising the miners in the Tinto River basin in the southern province of Huelva to assist the government forces in fighting, urging them to surrender immediately, saying that many towns and villages near the Tinto River have been occupied by our army, and I have detained seventy miners as hostages. I hope you will not forget. For your sake, the best thing to do is to surrender immediately. You must know that our army is constantly reporting victories and gaining the upper hand day by day. Moreover, the road from the city of Burgos in the north to this city has been reopened, which shows that our army has established contact between the north and south routes. The fall of the capital Madrid is not far away. The Marxists, in view of this, vainly hope to mobilize other countries to come out and mediate, so that they can prolong their lives, but they know that this is impossible. They only have one way to surrender unconditionally. There are rumors that I personally have ambitions, which is not true. This is what I want to state. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Delbos recently sent another document to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, explaining the French government's views on the issue of amending the League Covenant, which can be roughly divided into three levels: (1) French Prime Minister Léon Blum and himself had previously made statements at the League of Nations General Assembly on July 1st and 3rd, reaffirming France's adherence to the collective security system, and now reiterated it. (2) The obligation of mutual assistance must be limited so that those who bear this obligation are limited to countries neighboring the invaded country. (3) Expand the authority of the League of Nations, but the main principles on which the Covenant is based and collective responsibility should not be reduced. In addition, Delbos also said that the French government is very willing to adjust Articles 11 and 16 of the Covenant. In other words, the measures stipulated in Article 11 of the Covenant do not need to be implemented through a unanimous vote of all members of the Executive Council, so that those who threaten peace will not be able to escape punishment due to a single vote. Regarding Article 16 of the Covenant, regional mutual assistance conventions should be concluded between countries with the same geographical location or common interests, so that the economic, financial and military sanctions contained in that article can be mutually reinforcing. The French government will submit more detailed and specific measures regarding the above viewpoints before the next League of Nations General Assembly convenes, if necessary. However, it does not intend to submit a detailed plan at this time, because more than a month has passed since France made the proposal, and most countries have not yet decided on their position.

<p>Yosemite, California, USA: The Pacific Science Congress opened here today. Representatives from countries along the North Pacific, such as China, Japan, the Philippines, Hawaii, Canada, Soviet Russia, and the United States, attended. Britain also participated in the meeting because it has various interests in the Pacific. Mexico did not send a representative. The delegations from various countries have a maximum of 35 people, all of whom are leaders in the domestic political, business, economic, and educational fields. The attendance of the Soviet Russian representatives for the first time is particularly important. The Soviet Union has always only participated in international organizations in Europe. This direct contact with the organization of Pacific countries shows that its interests in the Pacific have greatly increased. The League of Nations also sent officials to observe due to the importance of this conference. The person selected was Mr. Lennox, Director of the League of Nations Paris Office, who has already arrived here. Although the League of Nations does not participate in the opinions of all discussions and resolutions of the conference, Mr. Lennox's report will be a reference material for the League of Nations. The most important issues to be discussed at this conference are the following: (1) Suggesting an international organization to maintain peace in the Pacific; (2) Concluding a mutual assistance and non-aggression treaty between Pacific countries; (3) Organizing a permanent Far East Conference to prepare for consulting on various fixed emergency issues; (4) Establishing a border delimitation committee to handle all disputes regarding existing national borders by peaceful means.

<p>Oslo: The Soviet Russian People's Commissar of Internal Affairs announced yesterday that Trotsky, the leader of the anti-cadre faction of the Communist Party, had sent party members to sneak into Russia to use terrorist means against the leaders of the Communist Party. The Supreme Court has now scheduled to hear this case on the 19th of this month. Trotsky issued a statement to the press, resolutely denying this statement, and said that the Norwegian government may organize a committee to investigate, and it will be known that the accusations made by the Soviet Russian government are all fabricated. There are many people in Soviet Russia who are hostile to the current government, but he personally has nothing to do with Soviet Russia. He is now engaged in writing, but only commenting on the current situation in Soviet Russia. Generally, "The Soviet Russian bureaucracy regards all kinds of criticism as conspiracies, so it creates this kind of shocking news in order to put me in crime, but it is known that I have always opposed personal terrorism."

Among them, Communist Party General Secretary Stalin was the target of the group's conspiracy. Recently, 150 reactionaries were arrested in Tbilisi, the capital of the Transcaucasian Federal Republic, including a person named Stobanyan, who had been arrested once before for participating in a Trotskyist conspiracy. He is still unrepentant and his crimes are particularly serious. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e40">Anecdote of the Southern Tour: Current Situation of Remnant Bandits in Southern Zhejiang <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shi Ying</p>
<p>The border area of the four provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui, comprising some thirty to forty counties, large and small, was once heavily tinged with red by Fang Zhimin's troops of the pseudo "Soviet Government of the Gan-Zhe-Min Province" in the past four or five years. Since the National Army's five encirclement and suppression campaigns, which forcibly drove Zhu De and Mao Zedong out of their so-called "Central Red Area" lair, the important towns in these four provinces were successively recovered. The general attention to the bandit suppression issue was mostly focused on the intelligence regarding Zhu and Mao's main forces fleeing westward to Sichuan and Guizhou and attacking northward into Shaanxi and Shanxi. The activities of the remnant bandits in these four provinces, as well as the effectiveness of their suppression, seemed like the setting sun, fleeting and not worth considering.</p>
<p>However, in reality, such optimism is not warranted. On the surface, the so-called "suppression of the remnant bandits" seems easier than suppressing the main forces, a task that can be accomplished quickly. But in reality, because the remnant bandits are all local natives, very familiar with the terrain and local customs, they disperse as civilians and gather as bandits. Their resistance capability is weak, but their mobility is stronger than that of the main forces. The troops tasked with suppressing these remnant bandits find that because they (the bandits) appear and disappear unpredictably, gathering and dispersing constantly, sending too many soldiers yields no target, and sending too few often leads to unexpected ambushes. Here is an analogy: killing a chicken certainly does not require a butcher's knife, but if the chicken is not a docile hen waiting to be slaughtered, but a wild chicken that flies and jumps, then not only will a "chicken knife" be useless, even a butcher's knife will have no place to be used. Therefore, the current military suppression of remnant bandits everywhere, coupled with the insufficient strength of the security forces and some of the National Army, even after a considerable period, has still not diminished the strength of the elusive remnant bandits. The external cause of this phenomenon is very similar to the aforementioned chicken-killing story.</p>
<p>Take the bandit situation in southern Zhejiang as an example. Since the National Army defeated Fang Zhimin's main force, it also transferred the 18th Army, victorious in the Jiangnan bandit suppression, to be stationed there. The bandit suppression military operations, sometimes intense and sometimes lax, have never ceased. During the recent unrest in Guangdong and Guangxi, the National Army was transferred to deal with it, giving the remnant bandits an opportunity of "when the cat is away, the mice will play." As a result, they began to stir, planning to rekindle the dying embers. The most obvious example is that Kaihua County was briefly lost last month, and at the beginning of this month, the villages were looted again. The bandits are now occupying Mount Dalong, organizing a county Soviet government, and are plotting to contact other bandit groups to advance into Changshan, Suian, and Qu County. On the eve of Kaihua's fall, Jiangshan received a phone call from Xiakou (60 li from Jiangshan City), only stating that three groups of bandits from northern Fujian, each with dozens of people, were attempting to attack Xiakou. Unexpectedly, the next morning, an alarm sounded, but it was a bandit force of 500 that had captured Kaihua. After the second looting of Kaihua's major villages, it was reported that "the bandit force had increased to more than 2,000, and the peasant bandits numbered up to 30,000. The security force shortened the defense line to protect the county seat." The bandits' surprise tactics and the ferocity of their red terror tactics are evident.</p>
<p>Tracing the history of the remnant bandits who have been roaming southern Zhejiang in recent years, it seems that they also have "no small background." After the pseudo 7th Army Group was defeated, a portion of it entered Zhejiang and was reorganized into the pseudo Independent Division, with Li Yu, former chief of staff of the 7th Army Group, as commander, and Liu Ying, former political commissar, remaining as political commissar. Recently, Huang Ligui, a barber by origin, was added. They are all notorious bandit leaders famous in three provinces. The pseudo Independent Division's organizational strength is divided into five columns, each column divided into three detachments, each detachment divided into three squads, each squad with seven or eight people. Each column has about one to two hundred people, over a hundred rifles, and one or two light and heavy machine guns and Mauser pistols. In addition, there are organizations such as peasant and worker guerrilla teams, whose numbers are difficult to estimate accurately. Their area of activity is no more than the border counties of Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. Taking the southern Zhejiang area alone, it includes Kaihua, Suian, Changshan, Longyou, and Jiangshan counties, and sometimes extends to the Lishui area. Looking through local newspapers, one sometimes finds news of the same bandit leader carrying out a major looting on the same day in different neighboring provinces. This is not a newspaper misprint, but rather because the bandits' tracks are erratic and their actions are secretive, making them difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>The bandit army's tactics are based on guerrilla warfare, exploiting weaknesses and attacking unguarded areas, not fighting hard battles with the National Army. They often use small numbers of bandits to contain the actions of larger troop forces, such as placing guerrilla teams near the large army fortresses to operate, or moving large troop forces to distant rear areas to operate, always avoiding direct contact with the army. Whenever scouts arrive at a place, they establish communication stations and work networks, intelligence networks, etc., to maintain contact and supply from other sources. In the past, they also had wireless communication to exchange information, but it was later surrounded and confiscated by the army. Their economic sources usually rely on "attacking local bullies and extorting money from wealthy people." Bandit leaders such as Liu Ying and Huang Ligui always carry huge amounts of cash and silver. If bandit soldiers accumulate a lot of money, they must turn it over to the political commissar, otherwise they are considered reactionary and severely punished. They face many difficulties, and even food and winter clothing are often problematic. Wounded soldiers have no hospitals and can only be hidden in the homes of ordinary people for treatment. Some medicines are purchased directly from pharmacies (the owner of a large Western pharmacy in Qu County was killed for selling these medicines), and some are ordered from local bullies, who buy them and send them as a ransom. The most lacking is ammunition, so they often make great sacrifices to seize ammunition. Not long ago, a certain division had nine transport vehicles traveling from Jiangshan to Pucheng in northern Fujian. The bandits learned that the ninth vehicle was fully loaded with ammunition and planned to ambush it at a certain bridge. After the first eight vehicles passed, the bridge suddenly collapsed, and the ammunition carried by the remaining vehicle was completely unloaded and transported to the mountains. In addition, there are other sources of weapons, but most are related to unsavory dealings with other parties, which I will not elaborate on.</p>
<p>Their methods of communizing the people are that whenever they arrive in a place, they use existing group members, such as the Baojia system, schools, and the Green Gang, to induce the masses, or directly investigate the population, convene meetings, use the people's suffering to tell them to attack local bullies and distribute land, and proclaim that if they are unwilling to participate in red activities, they will not be given land in the future. Peasants see land as life, and some naturally willingly participate, especially ordinary paper workers who went on strike because the September 18th Incident lightly gave their product distribution markets of paper and ramie cloth in the Northeast to the enemy, thus these industries successively ceased, causing them to lose their jobs in large numbers and fall into a difficult life. When everyone was full of grief and at a loss, they suddenly heard the Communist Party's slogans of anti-imperialism and resistance against XX, which naturally more easily moved their heartstrings. If there are still hesitant farmers, they will also have the names of strong men listed, forced to be incorporated into the guerrillas. Those who do not work are executed for the crime of reaction. With such inducements and threats, why worry that party members will not gather more and more every day?</p>
<p>A friend named Wu Juefei, who came from northern Fujian, once served as an assistant to the special party department of a certain division in northern Fujian and as an instructor in the Zhenghe County Security Corps of the First Pacification Zone in Fujian. Although his official title was not large, his position was between the government and the people in the recovered areas, so he spoke of several practical materials related to this. The reporter believes that this is very valuable.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu said that the main reason why the remnant bandits in northern Fujian are difficult to eradicate is not on the bandit side, but on the official side. If politics are not clear and the government is not honest, then the "rampant" remnant bandits will not be completely eliminated. How many of those currently engaged in political work are not thinking about fiat money? Even if there are such people, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be dragged "into the sea" by the bad environment. Take the county magistrate as an example. If he does not cooperate with the local gentry, firstly, he is afraid that they will find fault and cause trouble. A five-cent stamp can be used to accuse him to his superiors. Even if he is not removed from his post, he will have to shed a layer of skin. Secondly, it will not be easy to handle affairs. If the army is stationed and the county magistrate is ordered to conscript laborers, the county magistrate who does not have good relations with the local gentry will be at a loss. On the contrary, if he has good relations with the local gentry, they will help him pay for hiring laborers, allowing him to enjoy the benefits. However, afterwards, they will apportion the money to the common people for repayment, and you can only pretend to be mute. However, the common people should die.</p>
<p>He also said: The common people in northern Fujian are truly extremely poor. When I (Mr. Wu referring to himself) went to various places to guide the organization of the Baojia and train strong men, I was ordered by my superiors to collect a small fee of 20 cents per household from the people on the spot for the expenses required by each organization, and the extremely poor were exempt. However, the common people in the recovered areas and the neighboring bandit areas are all among the hungry, and who is not extremely poor? How can they be distinguished? To be exempt from taxation, everyone must be exempt. However, the imperial order is urgent, and there is no way to raise funds, so I had no choice but to collect the money. One family even sent six eggs prepared for the pregnant woman to eat, asking to use them as the price of 20 cents in fees (if the collection office allocates this substitute to the food expenses to make dishes, I don't know how to swallow it?). In some remote townships, they resist miscellaneous taxes and duties, and kill the collectors in groups. The government certainly cannot ignore it. As a result, unexpected social changes often occur. "The common people are very afraid of public officials, and public officials are also very afraid of the common people." This is truly an unprecedented miracle. If we try to calculate these unfortunate phenomena according to geometric algorithms, and apply the theorems of "officials force the people to rebel" and "the people are poor and become bandits" to calculate the result, then the question of whether the remnant bandits can be eliminated can be answered appropriately.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's remarks can be called "experienced words" and can also be called "heartfelt words." Although this refers to northern Fujian, the various situations in southern Zhejiang, which is close at hand, are roughly the same. Therefore, I dare to borrow flowers to offer to the Buddha, summarizing Mr. Wu's conversation to make the conclusion of this article, "If the government reduces exploitation, the burden on the people is lighter, and the general hard-working masses all have a way to make a living, then it will be easier to completely eliminate the remnant bandits."</p>

<p>— By Constance Coline, Translated by Yue Qi</p>
<p>(Taking Diogenes is an ancient Greek philosopher who often carried a lantern in the streets to seek the truth. – Translator's Note)</p>
<p>I recently visited Rome, where I spent two weeks trying to find a Fascist who could understand and was not biased. But I didn't even have the luck to run into just one.</p>
<p>I saw many enthusiastic supporters of Fascism. They are mindless practitioners who absorb spiritual nourishment from newspapers every day. These "core members" are satisfied with exaggerated rhetoric and lack the ability to judge the political and economic problems that endanger modern times, and keep saying "We are real, noble, smart, and brave." They form a class that seems to exist in any country, including the nobility, the bourgeoisie, and the common people. Rather than saying it is a social class, it is a class of intellect; in terms of physiognomy, we can say it belongs to the "muscular type."</p>
<p>I also met ideologues who explained to me that Fascism melts all parties in the furnace, making them into one party; they said that no one cares about his own private interests and dedicates himself to the public interest; they said that everyone feels happy in cities and villages; and they said that even if there are poor people, they don't suffer from poverty, because their "ideal" relieves them of their worries. I must admit that these ideologues really turned me upside down and really made me believe them. Unfortunately, the various facts I encountered proved that although they are all sincere, loyal, and believing people, their words are not reliable at all, because they have been stunned by their beliefs and lost any ability to recognize them.</p>
<p>In the end, I also felt that searching for the truth there made people very disappointed, because when we engage in such a search, we will realize that many of man's noblest illusions are based on incorrect interpretations.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>A Fascist fanatic said: "The enthusiasm shown by the people when they donated wedding rings and gold jewelry to the motherland was completely sincere and really moving."</p>
<p>The evidence of the facts proves that in the days before the ceremony, counterfeit merchants made a fortune selling fake wedding rings.</p>
<p>Italian citizens living abroad all received individual pieces of mail from their home country, instructing them to send their gold jewelry to the nearby consulate.</p>
<p>Many Italians told me that they donated their wedding rings entirely out of fear, because if they disobeyed the order, they would suffer.</p>
<p>An ideologue said: The Party allows those who truly love the ideology to donate as much as they can afford. What is important is not their money but their beliefs.</p>
<p>The evidence of the facts proves that a poor woman without a husband or parents ran to the Party headquarters to renew her Party card. "Have you donated your wedding ring to the motherland?" they asked her. "I don't have a wedding ring." "Then your jewelry, or your crucifix?" "I don't have jewelry, and I don't have a crucifix. I have nothing." "Then you have to pay 100 lire, 80 lire more than usual, to replace the jewelry you should have donated."</p>
<p>She paid the full amount, because without a Party card, she would have absolutely no chance to find a job.</p>
<p>An ideologue said: The achievements of the cooperative system are admirable. Any worker is protected, and the interests of employers and workers are aligned. The cooperation between employers and employees has finally been realized.</p>
<p>The evidence of the facts proves that a civil engineering contractor (a Fascist Party member) said: "Since the adoption of the cooperative system, it has been difficult to hire good workers. They send workers to you, regardless of whether these workers are skilled or whether you are satisfied with them." I asked, "Do you think the cooperative system is improving?" He said, "It's all just officialdom. In general, it can be said that nothing has changed, because every time a reform comes, a plan to evade it is devised."</p>
<p>A Fascist fanatic said: Any Italian is prepared to die to protect the ideology.</p>
<p>The evidence of the facts proves that I personally know at least ten Italians who are prepared to die to overthrow the ideology.</p>
<p>On the political stage, I got to know another type of sincere supporter of the ideology. I thought their becoming Fascists was not out of necessity, and I also thought they were not deliberately concealing their feelings. I thought loving the ideology was the same as loving a lover: everyone is prone to misunderstand the source of love. From the time they participated in the activity, they closed the doors of critical consciousness and skeptical consciousness in their hearts.</p>
<p>But no matter how enthusiastic or how believing they are, I cannot regard them as "typical Fascists." What I have been looking for in these two weeks is an understanding and unbiased person who supports, loves, and adheres to the ideology entirely because of his own free will. But I could not find such a Fascist in the end.</p>
<p>Now let us turn to the enemies of Fascism and take a look. We can find all kinds of enemies of Fascism, but they are all not taken seriously. Of course, among them are the smartest, most chivalrous, and most educated Italians, but this fact is not important. Dictatorship does not need intelligence, does not need chivalry, and does not need culture; all it needs is obedience.</p>
<p>These people are not taken seriously because, in terms of class, they are individualists. They have no organization, and their opinions are inconsistent. They do not fit anywhere, they do not manipulate any actions, but people are afraid of them and avoid them, because being seen with them is bound to create a bad impression.</p>
<p>We must understand that the entire current Fascist organization is based on secret notifications. This type of notification creates fear, fear creates obedience, and almost nationwide slavery is thus accomplished. We must also understand that the reason why anti-Fascists are narrow-minded is the same as the reason why ideologues are narrow-minded. Listen to them speak, and you will think that their words are not reliable. They deny obvious truths, and they often agitate people's hearts in the same way as ideologues.</p>
<p>If we recall the chaotic state of Italy in 1922, we will understand why it was necessary to "do this." "This" has been done and done well. If they allowed newspapers to freely accept subsidies, freely criticize, and if any doubtful actions or discussions were not censored, would "this" have been done just as well? Probably not done just as well.</p>
<p>But now that Italy has passed through its adolescence crisis, the framework has been completed, and the plan has been implemented on time, why continue to bind this tamed beast? Why create new shackles like war that are supposed to be to save the people? Why prescribe more and more dangerous nationalistic goals for the people? Why make the people suffer material sacrifices? Probably not to make Fascism more important, nor to make it better. So, why?</p>
<p>I am reluctant to conclude that all of this is to preserve one person's power, but there are many times when I cannot help but think so.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Situation of the Western Banner Dispute: The Great Lama Attacks the Stone Prince's Residence; Fierce Fighting Near the Gegeqi Temple <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>——A Foreigner Commands the Army——</p>
<p>Baotou Dispatch: Shila Budorji of the Western Public Banner of the Urad League, due to his uncle, the Great Lama Yixi, and the former general of the banner, Gegeqi (in charge of all the banner's military power), Mantou, and others wanting to seize power from the Stone Prince, besieged the Prince's residence with troops in April of last year, causing disputes. Fierce battles occurred several times, lasting for months. The government dispatched personnel to mediate in various ways, and the matter was resolved in November of last year. The Stone Prince was suspended from his post for eight months according to an order from the Executive Yuan, while the Great Lama and others went to the Mongol Political Affairs Council in Bailing Temple. The Western Banner dispute was temporarily quelled. At the beginning of the incident, the Mongol Political Affairs Council sent a security team to Meiligeng Temple within the banner's territory. One of the conditions of the mediation was to order the team to withdraw to the temple. After the matter was settled, the team has remained stationed there without withdrawing. In early spring of this year, the Great Lama returned from the temple to Meiligeng Temple, gathering his old subordinates, planning to seize an opportunity to make trouble for the Stone Prince again. At the same time, a foreigner frequently traveled to and from Meiligeng Temple, secretly providing guidance, and an airfield was built there. Airplanes come and go from time to time, so Meiligeng Temple has now formed a special situation. Those in the know have long known that disputes will inevitably arise, and its significance is certainly different from the previous time. In July of this year, the Stone Prince's eight-month suspension period expired. Chairman Fu (Zuoyi) petitioned the Executive Yuan for his reinstatement. The Stone Prince returned to the banner a few days ago and resumed his position as co-Jasak. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this month, the Great Lama suddenly led his followers to attack the Stone Prince's residence again. Upon receiving the news, the Stone Prince also deployed troops in Seden Hulutou Township (belonging to the Third District of Baotou) to prepare for defense. On the 6th of this month, the two sides opened fire in the township, and the fierce battle was quite intense. The Prince's army had fifty soldiers, and the Great Lama had more than seventy soldiers. Due to the disparity in numbers and the fact that the Great Lama's army had sophisticated weapons and ammunition, the Prince's army could not resist and retreated steadily. The Great Lama led his troops to pursue relentlessly. On the evening of the 9th, the Prince's army retreated to the vicinity of Gegeqi Temple and was caught up by the Great Lama. The two sides lined up in opposition for several hours. At dawn on the 10th, the battle resumed and was even more fierce. It continued until 5:00 PM without stopping. The Baotou County Government received a report from the Third District and urgently dispatched Yang Yingnan, the deputy director of the Security Department, by car to the Third District at around 7:00 AM on the 10th, in order to command the garrison security team to strictly guard the key crossings along the Yellow River, so as to prevent harassment of the residents of the county and maintain local security. It is said that Gegeqi Temple is located north of the Baotou-Wuwu highway, close to the highway. Since the 10th, automobiles have stopped running to avoid danger. It is also heard that there are four foreigners in the Great Lama's army, providing on-the-spot guidance.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Japanese Military Attaché Imai Talks: Bandit Disturbances in Eastern Sui Have Nothing to Do With Japan; Our Authorities Are Still Intensifying Precautions and Eliminating Disputes in the Western Public Banner <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: After the puppet army invading Eastern Sui was defeated, there have been no further actions recently. However, during this period, a dispute occurred in the Western Public Banner of Sui between the Great Lama Yi and the Stone Prince. The two sides have clashed multiple times since the 10th of this month. The outside world is concerned about this. According to sources, after a certain party's attempt to use puppet troops to invade Eastern Sui failed, they are now shifting their target to the Western Public Banner. The Western Public Banner, Suiyuan, and Baotou form a triangle, and the area is important. The Sui authorities, in view of this, are not only stepping up deployments for defense but are also making every effort to eliminate the disputes in the Western Public Banner.</p>
<p>When Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Imai Takeo met with Chinese and foreign reporters on the 14th, many inquired about the Eastern Sui issue. Imai said, "Regarding this issue, there have been many rumors from the outside world in recent days, but none of them are credible. The actual situation is that Chairman Fu (Zuoyi) of Suiyuan reportedly dispatched troops to Eastern Sui at the end of last month. Those who did not know the truth were greatly alarmed, thinking that the problem had become serious. After investigation, it was learned that there were more than 500 bandits on the border of Suiyuan at that time, and the Sui army was dispatched to suppress them. Since then, the number of bandits has gradually increased to two or three thousand, so the bandit suppression army has also been increased. The outside world's claim that there are two regiments or even two divisions of the Japanese army supervising the battle behind the bandits is ridiculous. Japan believes that China, whether it is Eastern Sui or other regions, is Chinese territory, and everything should be carried out in accordance with the principles of Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation. The bandit disturbances in Eastern Sui have nothing to do with Japan."</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, since the establishment of the Hirota Cabinet in Japan, its general policy has not yet been fully determined. Some advocate a "southward advance policy," which is to seize rights and interests in the South Seas, but this raises many concerns with Britain and the United States. Others advocate a "northward advance policy," which is to patrol and occupy Inner Mongolia to resist Russia, with North China as the next priority. However, if Inner Mongolia is immediately seized, there are also considerations regarding the Soviet Union. Due to the environment and other factors, which steps to take are currently undecided. Therefore, the rumored changes in the situation in the outside world are not necessarily true at present. However, it is true that those who want to get promoted are stirring up trouble in the middle. The Eastern Sui issue was largely caused by this. Others were prepared, and there was nothing they could do. Ultimately, the situation in Inner Mongolia will be serious, which is also a planned scheme by others. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Lu Salt Export to Japan Is About to Be Realized; The First Batch Is 70,000 Tons; The Lu Feng Store Has Been Established <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: The export of Lu salt to Japan has been repeatedly discussed between Japanese commissioners Kaneshiro Kawanishi and Vice Consul Junichi Nagai and the Changlu Salt Transport Office and the Export Office. The export methods and purchase procedures have been specifically agreed upon. However, regarding the tax rate, the Ministry of Finance originally stipulated a tax of one yuan per ton, but the Japanese side expressed disagreement and requested that the precedent of Qingdao salt export be followed, with a tax of 96 cents per ton. The Transport Office has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions, and it is expected that there will be no problem. The major matters can be realized in advance at the end of this month. According to Liu Renfu, the section chief of the Export Office, the Lu Feng Store, a Lu salt export merchant, has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and officially started business yesterday. The store is indeed composed of various beach households, so Shao Jingyin, the chairman of the Beach Industry Association, has been appointed as the manager to take full responsibility. The office is temporarily located in Hangu, and it is planned to establish a branch or office here in the future for close liaison. Next, the more than 50 tons of salt stored in Hangu will be exported as a priority to help the beach households there. We are now waiting for the Japanese side to purchase. According to Japanese Vice Consul Nagai, "The Lu salt export method has been completely agreed upon. Only the tax rate is slightly higher than that of Qingdao. After negotiations with the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, it is no longer a problem. Currently, our country urgently needs industrial salt, so we will advance its realization within this month. The first batch is 70,000 tons. After it is transported to Japan, we will continue to purchase. Within days, we will instruct Mitsubishi, Iwai, Toyo Soda, and other importing merchants to contact the Lu Feng Store to purchase salt." (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Chahar Construction Department Plans to Restore the Longyan Iron Mine; Sends Personnel for Inspection and Formulates Restoration Opinions; The Hebei-Chahar Construction Committee Submits to the Economic Committee for Review <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Dispatch: Yantong Mountain, two li north of Xuanhua County, Chahar Province, is rich in red iron ore. Longguan County produces magnetic iron ore. The ore vein is sixty li long and has extremely rich reserves and quality that ranks first in the country. The former Longyan Iron Mining Company was a joint venture between the government and merchants with a capital of 5 million yuan in the seventh year of the Republic of China. It managed the mining and applied for a mining area of 42 square li and 375 mu. Initially, it was planned to smelt iron locally, but due to many inconveniences, the iron smelting plant was changed to Shijingshan in western Beiping. Equipment for mining and smelting was largely in place, but due to the exhaustion of capital and the inability to continue, it has been suspended to this day. Recently, the Chahar Provincial Construction Department sent Li Fengcen to inspect. After returning to the department, in addition to reporting the suspension situation, he also formulated opinions on increasing capital and restoring the mine. After the Chahar Construction Department reviewed it, Zhang Lisheng and Qiao Shibing of the Hebei-Chahar Construction Committee submitted it to the Construction Committee for resolution and transferred it to the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee for review. The proposals of Zhang and Qiao are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The original proposal reads, "Mining is one of the important productions. The coal mining in Chahar Province has made progress in recent years. More than 60 mining operations have been licensed for mining, but there is not a single metal mine that has been mined and smelted. Gold, silver, copper, and lead mines may be due to incomplete exploration and the treasures are buried, or due to the lack of drilling and mining, the reserves are unknown, and waiting to be managed. The Xuanhua Yantong Mountain and Longguan Iron Mine are uniquely rich in accumulation and rank first in the country, but have not yet resumed work, which is a pity. Recently, in order to understand the current situation of the iron mine in the area, the head of the Second Section of this department, Li Feng, was sent to inspect. After he returned, he reported the situation of the continued suspension and submitted opinions. The content of the report is 'Opinions on the restoration of the Longyan Iron Mine, requesting review and approval, and to be implemented in order to lay the foundation for the basic industry of North China.' The Longyan Iron Mining Company was the first to mine Pangjiabao and Xinyao in Longguan County, with a total area of 25 square li and 195 mu. A license was issued on June 21 of the seventh year of the Republic of China. The company was named Longguan. Then, on November 2 of the same year, the former Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce issued a mining license for Yantong Mountain in Xuanhua County, with an area of 17 square li and 180 mu. The three places total 42 square li and 375 mu and were renamed to the current name. The ore quality is all red iron ore, but Longguan also produces magnetic iron ore. The mineral quality of Longguan Iron Mine is purer than that of Xuanhua County. In summary, the iron content of the iron ore ranges from 45% to 65%, with an average of over 50%. The iron ore reserves are 100 million tons. During the Longguan Company period, there was a proposal to build a branch road from Xuanhua to Pangjiabao. After the addition of the Yantong Mountain mining area, it was closely connected to Xuanhua Station. A 16-hua li branch road was built by the former Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Bureau from the station around the western suburbs of the county to the Shuimo Station, about two li north of the city. A light railway of eight hua li was built from Shuimo to the north to the mining mountain. Shuimo Station was used as the starting point for transporting ore. At this time, Yantong Mountain was mined first, and Longguan was operated later. The construction of the Pangjiabao branch road was discussed from Sui. The original plan for the mining and treatment of Yantong Mountain Iron Ore was to smelt iron locally. A limestone plant was surveyed and determined at Baobao Mountain in Huailai County, and coal mines of 29 square li, 150 mu, and 4,758 square chi were measured and claimed in Baicaoyao, Huangyazi, and Wucha in Yu County. Six hundred mu of land were purchased in the west of Xuanhua City as a site for building factories and setting up furnaces. The solvent was taken from Huailai, and the fuel was supplied from Yu County. This was the original design. Later, the Shijingshan Station on the Pingmen Road was adjacent to the capital, and its location was superior. The Zhaizhai coal and coke could be purchased nearby, so there was no need to operate the coal industry. The coal and coke in the Sixhegou coal mine and the major mines in Hebei, which were suitable for iron smelting, could be transferred by train. The limestone in General's Mausoleum was pure in texture and was considered the best in metallurgy. The area was located on the Yongding River in the lower reaches of the Yang River, so there was no shortage of water. All of this was beyond the reach of Xuanhua, so the idea of iron smelting in Xuanhua was abandoned, and the decision to build a factory in Shijingshan was made. The major details were obtained, and all kinds of equipment, such as houses, furniture, and related mining and iron smelting, as well as transportation equipment, and all replacement parts, were largely prepared. In particular, a railway was built from the General's Mausoleum Limestone Plant to Sanjiadian Station on the Pingmen Road and two iron furnaces, one completed and one uncompleted, in Shijingshan consumed a lot of money. From the establishment of the company to the suspension, a total of 6 million national currency was spent, exceeding the original amount of 5 million yuan in shares by a significant amount. This is the general situation of the Longyan Company. After the company was suspended, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines of the National Government established the Longyan Mining Bureau around the 17th year of the Republic of China and planned to resume work, but due to pending funding, the Ministry of Railways was assigned to take custody of it. In August of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the Northwest Development Association came to Chahar and held its second annual meeting. The meeting proposed the restoration of the Xuanlong Iron Mine to extract this 100 million tons of treasure and requested the Ministry of Railways to allocate 3 million yuan for the restoration work to establish the most fundamental foundation for developing the Northwest with the fastest and most effective results. It has been shelved until now. Iron is to the country as food is to the farmer. If the farmer eats but does not cultivate, he will inevitably sell it, abandon it, and be invaded by others. The same is true of iron mines. Now, the mines along the Yangtze River, such as Daye Elephant Nose Mountain, are sold to the eastern neighbors to extract value, which is mining in reality. The mines in Benxihu and Anshan in southern Manchuria have long been in the hands of foreigners, which is being invaded. Longyan's decline is abandonment. If it is sold, abandoned, or invaded, the country's use of iron will remain the same. The customs trade register shows that the customs trade of steel imports averages between 400,000 and 600,000 tons per year, which can be counted as 500,000 tons. Of the steel imported from Jiangzhe and the Yangtze River customs, 200,000 tons account for 40% of the country, 150,000 tons imported from the Northeast customs account for 30% of the country, 50,000 tons imported from the Minyue Guidian customs account for 11%, and 100,000 tons imported from the Lu customs account for 20%. The country absorbs such a huge amount of foreign iron, and the Longyan Iron Mine's reserves are so large. It is a pity to allow it to be abandoned. The Ministry of Industry has tried to set up a steel plant. It first set up a plant in Pukou, then focused on Ma'anshan, and finally focused on Xiejiadian. The iron sand sought to obtain small mines in Anhui with reserves of 100,000, 200,000, and even millions of tons. Although it has not been completed, it has been actively discussed. The Longyan Iron Mine, which has a magnificent scale and failed to achieve success, was abandoned like a legacy, allowing foreign goods to arrive one after another, and the national treasures were sealed. If this continues, there will be those who surpass it. In order to avoid the situation and seek remedial measures, there is no way to go other than to choose one of the two methods: continued investment by government and people or joint investment between China and foreign countries. Continued investment by government and people should be gradually increased. The initial additional amount should be 5 million yuan. The government funds should still be the amount determined by the Northwest Development Association, with 3 million yuan allocated by the central government as government shares. The remaining 2 million yuan should be shared by the merchants and people of the counties under Hebei, Chahar, and Shandong and the cities of Beiping and Tianjin. It is reported that the Guangdong Provincial Government, due to the provincial iron plant also operating coal mines, applied to the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board for a huge loan, which has been approved by the Board at its 36th meeting in Beijing to borrow 4 million yuan for Sichuan to repair the Chengpeng Railway and mine copper and iron in Peng County by the Military Commission. The Hunan Liujia Coal Mine Industry Department borrowed 2 million yuan for development. The Shaanxi Provincial Government, seeing the progress of the development of the Northwest, urgently needs to drill and explore government coal fields and agreed with the Economic Committee to assist and the China Construction Bank to lend 3 million yuan. Although Xuanlong is a remote area, it is also a national domain and should not be discriminated against. If the Economic Committee and the two ministries of Iron and Steel or the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board are requested to allocate 3 million yuan, it should be easy. As for the people's support, the number of shares should be allocated to counties and cities as units, and stock certificates should be issued with numbers, with a minimum investment of ten yuan per share, allowing merchants and people to freely sell and buy, but not allowing them to leave the territory of the counties and cities. In the future, if the mining industry has surplus profits, the list will be checked and remitted, and the competent authorities of the provincial and municipal governments will distribute them in batches, and the merchants and people will be made aware that iron making is related to their livelihoods and is different from general investment for profit. In this way, the 2 million yuan in shares can be easily raised. This is the method of continued investment by government and people. Joint investment between China and foreign countries should be on a large scale. The total amount should first be 50 million yuan. In addition to the 6 million yuan of Chinese investment that has been used, foreign investment should first join the same amount of shares, and the remaining amount should be paid equally by both parties when expanding operations. Foreign investment does not distinguish between countries, nor between government and business. All friendly countries that are willing to invest are accepted. The company's affairs, unless otherwise specified, shall be handled in accordance with the Chinese Mining Law, Company Law, and other related laws. After the joint investment between China and foreign countries is agreed upon, in order to facilitate the collection of affairs, a Longyan Iron Mining Delegation must be established. The old government and merchant shareholders, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, and the provincial governments where the mining areas are located shall each send one person as a representative, and the representatives shall jointly elect one person as the chief representative to preside over the solicitation of foreign investment. The delegation address should also be set up in Beiping for convenience. This is another method of joint investment between China and foreign countries. The above two methods are proposed to be submitted by this department to the Provincial Government Committee for review and approval and then transferred to the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee for adoption, reference, and implementation in order to establish the basic industry of North China. Whether the proposal is appropriate, please review."</p>
<p>It is said that the various sections mentioned by the section chief are not without merit. If the Longyan Iron Mine is restored, not only will the industry of Chahar Province be revitalized, but also the neighboring provinces will benefit from it. The statement of establishing the basic industry of North China is probably not an exaggeration. However, how to proceed in the end, in addition to already sending a letter to the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee for review, it is reasonable to record the case and submit it for public decision.</p>

<p>Security Team Officers Escorted to the Province</p>
<p>Nie Dezhao, the deputy of the Seventh Brigade of the Provincial Security Team stationed in Suzhou, and Zhang Zehe, the military supply officer, were accused by someone to the Provincial Security Headquarters of dereliction of duty, malpractice, and deducting food rations for the imprisoned opium offenders. After repeated detailed investigations by Zhang Zhuoyu, sent by the District Headquarters to Suzhou, the Provincial Security Headquarters ordered Nie Dezhao to be suspended from his post pending investigation and handling, and the county government placed the key stakeholders, Squad Leader Xu Xianmin and Military Supply Officer Zhang Zehe, under custody after suspension. However, Xu Xianmin escaped after being arrested and is now being pursued. Magistrate Deng received a telegram from the Provincial Security Headquarters, ordering Nie Dezhao and others to be escorted to the province as soon as possible for interrogation. After receiving the telegram, Magistrate Deng summoned Nie Dezhao and others to the county and dispatched Zhang Delian, the head of the Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau, to lead a squad of police to escort Nie Dezhao, Zhang Zehe, Chang Lian, Chen Zhengfu, and others to the province at 2:00 AM on the 16th to be sent to the Provincial Security Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>New News on Smuggling Case</p>
<p>The patrol team of the Public Security Bureau previously arrested Zhang Wang, a woman who was smuggling artificial silk at the station, along with more than 30 catties of artificial silk and three bills of lading from Hengtong Transport Company. Together with officials from the Suzhou Customs, they seized two packages of artificial silk, totaling 39 catties, inside the Hengtong Transport Company, which is being verified. Zhang Wang stated that the artificial silk was purchased from silk factories such as Fuxin Qinyu in Shanghai and was artificial silk waste that was being sold in Suzhou and was not smuggling. The Shanghai Zuxin Textile Company has sent a letter to the Suzhou Customs to prove this and request their release. As for the more than 100 tons of suspected stolen coal seized by the General Labor Union in the Ni Songji Coal Shop, the resolution of the appraisal meeting of various agencies approved the automatic unsealing and sale. The Anti-Smuggling Association of the County Chamber of Commerce also resolved that the seizure of smuggled goods in the future should be accompanied by a certificate from the Suzhou Customs. A large number of paper goods seized by the General Labor Union were not within the designated scope of smuggling and have been released separately.</p>

<p>Police Officer Commits Suicide by Poisoning</p>
<p>Sun Zhifan, a police officer from the Fourth Sub-Station directly under the Urban District of the Public Security Bureau, is 32 years old. He committed suicide by poisoning because he was madly in love with a prostitute, Zhong Xiuying, and squandered public funds. He was taken to the County Hospital for rescue but died on the morning of the 16th. Sun Zhifan is a native of another province and has served in the police force for many years. He is capable and valued by the inspection officers of the station. The station's rent donations were all handled by Police Officer Sun. He made monthly settlements but was recently bewitched by a Suzhou prostitute, Zhong Xiuying, and his love was very hot, so he used up the rent donations he had collected. He initially planned to find a way to make up for it, but the new director is about to take over in Changshu, and all the taxes and donations collected should be handed over, so Police Officer Sun could not transfer the funds. On the night of the 14th of this month, he secretly swallowed sleeping pills and committed suicide. He was discovered the next morning and immediately sent to the County Hospital, but he died this morning due to severe poisoning. He left behind many letters, all stating his love for the prostitute and his deep regret for his past mistakes, and asking Inspection Officer Yan Shaoye to advance the arrears and he would repay him in the next life.</p>

Two robbers were guarding outside, and three robbers entered the house to rob. They first went to the room of Ruyuan's wife, Ms. Hu, and forced her to open the iron box, taking away 903 yuan in legal tender, three pearl flowers, three gold rings, and nine pieces of silverware, worth 200 yuan, all of which were robbed. All the small soft clothes were not taken. After the robbers obtained the loot, they fled outwards. Afterwards, the neighbors reported to the Fifth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, requesting to pursue the stolen goods and robbers. After receiving the report, Director Yao immediately led the police to pursue. Zhong Jihe, the captain of the Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau, also took detectives Dai Shouquan and Wang Bingsheng to the scene to pursue separately, but the robbers had already fled far away and could not be caught.</p>

<p>Tax Police Shoot Innocent Civilians</p>
<p>Tangtou Street in Hanling Market, east of Yin County, is a vital route to Xianxiang and Dasong. Every 2nd, 4th, and 8th day of the month is market day, and residents from dozens of miles around come to buy and sell goods. On the 14th, which was a market day, Zhou Xiangsheng from Tongxia Mountain and Ye Yuesheng from Dasha Mountain carried mountain goods to the market. After selling their goods, they used the proceeds to buy rice and head home. When they passed Dongqing Bridge in Xianxiang, several tax police officers from Dasong, dressed in plain clothes, were patrolling. Seeing the two men hurrying along with heavy loads, they suspected them of carrying smuggled salt and ordered them to stop. Zhou and Ye, because it was almost noon and their families were waiting for rice for lunch, coupled with the scorching sun and the distance still to home, and because they did not understand the local dialect, were unaware that these men were investigating smuggled salt. Therefore, they continued hurrying as before. This further aroused the suspicion of the tax police, who fired two shots at their lower bodies. The two men fell to the ground after being hit. The tax police went forward to inspect and, upon seeing that it was rice, realized their mistake. They left without regard for the injured men's lives. Later, some villagers passing by notified the families of the two men, who carried them to the Yin County Local Court for examination of their injuries and then sent them to the Chinese-American Hospital in the city for treatment.</p>

<p>— Gu Huimin</p>
<p>The Rockefeller Foundation of the United States has a long history of supporting educational endeavors in China, especially in medicine and natural sciences. In 1935, the foundation began to show a tendency to assist rural reconstruction efforts. In 1935, the foundation's funds for the "China Program" could be divided into five major categories, as listed below:</p>
<p>1935 Foundation Appropriations in China</p>
<p>(1) North China Program</p>
<p>Chinese Mass Education Promotion Association: National currency 50,000 yuan</p>
<p>Nankai University Institute of Economics: 37,500 yuan</p>
<p>Yenching University School of Social Sciences and School of Science: 77,325 yuan</p>
<p>(2) Nanjing Public Health and Medical Program</p>
<p>National Health Administration: National currency 87,500 yuan</p>
<p>Medical Education Committee: 21,250 yuan</p>
<p>(3) Jinling Agricultural Program</p>
<p>Jinling University Department of Agricultural Economics: US$5,500</p>
<p>Department of Natural Sciences: National currency 72,500 yuan</p>
<p>National Central University College of Agriculture (Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine): 34,600 yuan</p>
<p>Agricultural Experiment Station (Control work): 34,300 yuan</p>
<p>(4) Scholarships US$37,500</p>
<p>Subsidies</p>
<p>Subsidies for research and development US$10,000</p>
<p>North China Program</p>
<p>The higher education institutions in North China that receive subsidies from the Foundation include Nankai University in Tianjin and Yenching University in Peiping. The Dingxian Mass Education Promotion Association also receives its support.</p>
<p>The Dingxian Mass Education Promotion Association received an appropriation of National currency 150,000 yuan from the Foundation. This association is dedicated to rural reconstruction, originally established for the mass literacy movement, and has now become a well-organized institution for educational practice and research. This planned mass education movement is beyond the financial capacity of the local area, and therefore urgently needs external funding. Training in self-government, public security, education, people's livelihood, and public health is conducted under simple and economical principles. The association is currently engaged in the training of village government personnel, in order to expand this pilot program to the whole country. As for the original intention of the Foundation, it is to assist university graduates in engaging in rural training and to study new methods of rural reconstruction.</p>
<p>This cooperative program began on July 1st of last year. The Dingxian Mass Education Association now has a Special Training Committee, which has established 37 domestic scholarships in the fields of education, health, local administration, agriculture, and economics. In fact, Dingxian has become a training experiment center, with the pilot area being extended to Guangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Sichuan, Henan, and other provinces.</p>
<p>The Nankai University Institute of Economics received an appropriation of National currency 37,500 yuan from the Foundation. The purpose of the appropriation is to support the institute's teaching and research on rural reconstruction issues and to enable the institute to maintain close contact with the Dingxian Mass Education Area. Several graduates of the Nankai University Institute of Economics have gone to Dingxian for further training. The institute has added courses such as Cooperative Studies, Land Administration, Local Administration, and Local Finance. Several students have been assigned to various counties for eight months of practical training to prepare them for rural administrative positions. Seven domestic scholarships have also been established in the new courses.</p>
<p>Yenching University School of Social Sciences and School of Science received an appropriation of National currency 58,125 yuan from the Foundation, and the School of Social Sciences received an additional National currency 9,200 yuan for the development of rural reconstruction training courses. In addition to continuing to run pre-medical and pre-nursing courses, Yenching University has also established a new social science program, the purpose of which is to train young people to take on social and economic work such as local administration, rural administration, rural education, and peasant side occupations. Yenching University has also formed a committee with Nankai University and the Dingxian Mass Education Association to carry out planned programs. Since last year, Yenching University has established new rural courses, all of which are taught by full-time faculty.</p>
<p>The Yenching University School of Science has received assistance from the Rockefeller Foundation in recent years and is now also turning its attention to rural issues. The Department of Biology focuses on the study of entomology, and the Department of Chemistry is exploring rural side occupations such as pottery and leather making.</p>
<p>The three departments of the Yenching University School of Social Sciences have added as many as eleven new rural problem courses. 119 students have enrolled. In addition, there are special research classes in Cooperative Studies and Local Administration.

Over 1,000 people attended, including Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Gu Xinyi, Xu Jiqing, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Ge Jiecun, and Hu Xiyuan. Chairman Du Yuesheng led the entire body in taking the oath and then delivered a speech, saying, "Everyone, today we are holding a civic oath ceremony here. As for the significance of civic registration, it is purely for the election of the National Assembly. After we swear and register, we will obtain the right to elect and be elected. At the same time, we should pay more attention to following the oath, renewing the old and welcoming the new, upholding the Republic of China, and striving for regeneration, so as to promote the prosperity of the country and the nation."</p>
<p>Supervisor Wang Manyun's Admonition</p>
<p>Next, supervisor Wang Manyun gave an admonitory speech, saying, "We are here today to swear an oath, swearing that from today onwards, we will renew the old and welcome the new, and pledge our loyalty to uphold the Republic of China, follow the teachings of the Premier, and implement the Three Principles of the People. After taking the oath today, we are citizens of the Republic of China. We are cells in the entire organization of the Republic of China, and our relationship with the Republic of China is united as one. If the Republic of China is a steel machine, then we are the screws in this machine. If the Republic of China is a cement building, then we are every cement stone that makes up this cement building. For thousands of years, the Republic of China has suffered from innate weaknesses in its internal feudal politics and acquired damages from 20th-century imperialism. We should now take on the responsibility of protecting the Republic of China and building a new life for the Republic of China. We should always practice our oath and step onto the great era of struggle and regeneration in order to seek a bright future for the Chinese nation. Only then will we not fail our oath today, and only then will we not fail our responsibility as citizens."</p>

<h3 id="e71">Cocoon Merchants Scheduled to Meet to Discuss Autumn Cocoon Purchasing Methods <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Jiangzhe autumn silkworm rearing season has begun. The Cocoon Industry Association has scheduled a joint meeting for the 23rd to discuss cocoon purchasing methods. Banks are handling loans for purchasing autumn cocoons. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Seed Distribution in Two Provinces</p>
<p>After the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee's control of silk cocoons proved effective, it was decided to continue the control method for this year's autumn cocoons, following the spring cocoon method. The autumn silkworm eggs have already been distributed to the county governments for distribution to the farmers who raise silkworms and are about to hatch. The Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Committee has also distributed this year's autumn silkworm seeds to the county governments, allowing them to be distributed to farmers starting today. Silk factories and leftover cocoon merchants who wish to purchase this year's autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces must register with the silk cocoon authorities of the two provinces.</p>
<p>Cocoon Merchant Meeting</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Cocoon Industry Association has decided to hold a meeting in Hangzhou at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month because the autumn silkworms have begun to hatch, to discuss this year's autumn cocoon purchasing methods. Mr. Chu Huiseng, Chairman of the Association, made a special report at the joint meeting of the Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Associations yesterday, inviting all silk factory colleagues who wish to purchase this year's autumn cocoons in Zhejiang Province to attend the meeting on the 23rd to discuss the process together. Shanghai silk factories have also prepared to organize an autumn cocoon purchasing agency to handle cocoon purchasing matters.</p>
<p>Bank Loans</p>
<p>The 22 banks and money houses including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Shanghai Bank had excellent results from organizing the Jiangzhe Cocoon Purchasing Loan Syndicate in the spring of 1936. Although it has now ended, because the output of autumn cocoons this year is less than that of spring cocoons, it was decided not to organize a syndicate again, but to have each bank handle it independently. The method will be the same as the previous syndicate method. Silk factories and leftover cocoon merchants who wish to purchase autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can contact the banks themselves to borrow money.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Silk Factories from Zhejiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Improving Raw Silk Inspection Procedures <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association convened a joint meeting of silk factories from Zhejiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Silk Cocoon General Office on North Shanxi Road to discuss improving raw silk quality inspection procedures. Several important methods were decided. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>The attendees included Shen Huachen, Chen Zezhong, Zhang Yunsheng, Tang Yeqin (representing Cao Jinsheng), Huang Jiwen, and Zhang Peishen from Shanghai; Chu Huiseng and Ye Jingshi from Zhejiang; and Cheng Bingruo, Zheng Haiquan, Wang Huanan, Zhang Jifang, and Cao Shaochen from Wuxi. Shen Huachen was elected chairman.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the formalities were completed, Chairman Shen Huachen first reported on the two purposes of the meeting: (1) Since the Commodity Inspection Bureau implemented raw silk quality inspection on the 1st of this month, the inspection methods have created obstacles for both buyers and sellers of raw silk. First, the receipt form issued by the bureau for silk submitted for inspection is improper. Second, the public weighing fee for inspecting quality is set at 25 yuan per bale, which is excessive waste. Third, the inspection was originally scheduled to be completed in two days, but in reality, it is delayed to four days. (2) The Raw Silk Exporters Association held a meeting on the 5th of this month and resolved on five methods, the most important of which is the 25-strand raw silk sample strip issue. Our silk factory colleagues cannot tacitly agree to this. In summary, we should jointly discuss response methods.</p>
<p>Methods Decided</p>
<p>After the report, discussions began immediately. Representatives from the silk factories in Zhejiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai expressed their opinions one after another. The following resolutions were passed: A. Five methods for requesting the Commodity Inspection Bureau to improve its raw silk quality inspection procedures: (1) Request the Commodity Inspection Bureau to improve the receipt form to show caution. (2) Request to increase inspection efficiency (with the principle that inspection should be completed within two days) to benefit silk merchants. (3) Regarding the issue of public weighing fee waste, request the bureau to simplify the application procedures, allowing silk merchants to report and verify the quality first and then pay the public weighing fee if necessary, in order to avoid sacrifices. (4) Request the bureau to allow silk merchants to have the right to request a free re-inspection once. (5) Request the bureau not to limit the inspection certificate to five bales as a batch, but allow ten bales to be classified as a batch to avoid the drawback that each batch does not meet the 78 cm standard and is not allowed to be declared for export. B. Countermeasures against the five resolutions of the Exporters Association on August 5th: (1) We decide that the Exporters Association's resolution that after August 5th, the 25 silk strands (i.e., sample strips) inspected by silk factories selling silk to export firms should belong to the exporter. (2) When exporters conduct their own inspection, one sample is drawn from each bale. Now that the government agency has been changed to conduct the inspection, exporters should no longer need to draw samples for inspection. (3) The goods should be delivered directly by the manufacturer to the Commodity Inspection Bureau, believing that there is no need to deliver them to the exporter first. (4) Request the Commodity Inspection Bureau to postpone the announcement of the raw silk grade inspection standards and the implementation date of the inspection. (According to the grade inspection layer, the Commodity Inspection Bureau has scheduled to implement it on February 1st of next year. On the 5th of this month, the Exporters Association convened a general meeting to resolve to urge the government to implement this grade inspection as soon as possible, but the silk factory industry opposes the Exporters Association's claim). (5) Delivery of futures should be submitted to the Commodity Inspection Bureau for inspection no later than the 26th of each month. If there is a holiday, it may be extended. (6) The method of collecting money for raw silk transactions should be cancelled, and the exporter should immediately pay the full amount of the goods upon completion of inspection based on the public weighing slip, in accordance with the principle of cash on delivery. This will be implemented from September 1st. Before the exporters express their agreement, the delivery of September futures will be temporarily suspended. The above methods will be recorded and notified to the Exporters Association for reference. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Scheduled Consultation</p>
<p>After the meeting, Shen Huachen told the Da Gong She reporter that regarding the implementation of raw silk quality inspection, the exporter side (i.e., the buyer) and the silk merchant (i.e., the seller) have different opinions due to different positions. The Exporters Association convened a general meeting on the 5th of this month to resolve five methods regarding all transaction issues after the implementation of raw silk inspection. Silk merchants naturally find it difficult to agree because there are conflicts of interest with their own interests. In order to take into account the interests of both buyers and sellers in raw silk transactions, it has been decided that each of the silk factories in Zhejiang, Wuxi, and Shanghai will each send two representatives to consult with the Exporters Association at a later date. Director Miao Zhongxiu of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau will also be invited to attend and provide instructions so that a satisfactory solution can be obtained.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Inspector General of Customs, Frederick Maze, Travels North for Inspection <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Urge the Regular Bureau to Strictly Suppress Smuggling / Return South at the Beginning of the Month to Report to Finance Minister Kong</p>
<p>Although smuggling in North China has not been as rampant as in the past since the government's strict suppression, smuggled goods are still being stockpiled and Japanese ronin are still active. According to Xin Sheng She reporter's investigation, Inspector General of Customs Frederick Maze left Shanghai on the customs patrol ship Hai Xing the day before yesterday and traveled north to inspect ports such as Tianjin and Qinhuangdao in North China, urging the customs commissioners of each port to strictly enforce smuggling regulations. He is scheduled to return south at the beginning of next month to report to Finance Minister Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Amidst the Arrival of New Rice / Agricultural Warehouses Are Built One After Another / Spreading Throughout the Provinces of the Country and Deep into the Countryside / Meeting the Urgent Needs of Extraordinary Times <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>According to Hua Dong She, this year's new rice and early rice have already been harvested, and late rice will also be available in a month. Agricultural warehouses in various provinces have been established one after another. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Agricultural Warehouse Completion</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry and the guidance of the former National Economic Commission's Cooperative Affairs Committee, and with the voluntary efforts of the people in various provinces and cities, agricultural association warehouses have been completed after about three years, in line with the needs of the times. In total, each province of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi has one warehouse per county. Some of these warehouses are built by the province, some by the county, and some are operated automatically by the people with the support of economists and financiers. To date, they are sufficient for use.</p>
<p>Deep into the Countryside</p>
<p>These warehouses are the latest type of construction. Although there is no need for great buildings in the countryside, they are more ventilated and suitable for lighting than the rice barns built by farmers themselves. New and old grains can be stored for three or four years without spoiling, so they are highly trusted by farmers. However, in some villages, there are many local bullies who manipulate this new organization, just like bacteria mixed into cells, and farmers are very wary of them.</p>
<p>Concurrent Pawn Shop Operations</p>
<p>These warehouses are very suitable for emergency needs in extraordinary times. However, researchers of rural economics believe that warehouses have the opportunity to be utilized during the preparation period, and it is necessary to concurrently operate pawn shops. Farmers can temporarily pawn their farm implements and small valuables for use when they need them, and redeem them at a low interest rate during busy farming seasons, and use this as a revolving fund for small-scale side-farming economies.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Banks Handle Loans for the Transportation and Sale of Rice and Wheat / The Government Passes Relief Measures for Transportation and Sale / Japanese Merchants' Purchase of Wheat Drives Prices Up <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, this year's wheat crop has been a bumper harvest in all wheat-producing areas of the country. According to the calculations of the Nanjing Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute, the wheat production is 495 million jins. In particular, the wheat produced in the provinces of Shandong and Hebei in North China is of the best quality, and the wheat grains are larger than foreign wheat. This year's early rice has been a bumper harvest in rice-producing areas, and early and late rice will also be harvested one after another. Due to the favorable weather, it is predicted that there will also be a bumper harvest. The Executive Yuan has approved seven relief measures for the transportation and sale of rice and wheat in response to the request of the Hubei Provincial Government, and has ordered them to be followed.</p>
<p>Bank Loans</p>
<p>All banks that operate savings businesses have decided to handle various agricultural loans with at least one-fifth of the total savings amount, in accordance with Articles 7 and 8 of the Savings Bank Law. The total savings deposits in various banks is 600 million yuan. If one-fifth is calculated, it would be 120 million yuan. Banks handle agricultural loans, with rice, wheat, and cotton being the main agricultural products. The loan methods are divided into production and transportation and sale. The production period of rice, wheat, and cotton is about to pass, so banks such as the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the China Farmers Bank, and the Jin Cheng Bank have already started handling loans for the transportation and sale of rice and wheat.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants' Purchase</p>
<p>Since the Japanese Mitsui and Mitsubishi companies purchased wheat in our country's wheat-producing areas and loaded it onto ships to Japan for flour mills to produce flour, they are still continuing to purchase. As of yesterday, more than 300,000 dans had been loaded and exported. The price of wheat has risen due to the purchase by Japanese merchants. The current price of wheat is 5 yuan per 100-jin bag. The Chinese government is consulting with the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Finance on specific measures for the wheat export issue. As for the rumors that Japanese merchants are buying our country's rice, it is still difficult to verify.</p>

<p>The grain industry in Shanghai, in view of the lack of unified regulatory measures for grain production and sales in recent times, and the fact that foreign merchants are taking the opportunity to purchase cheap rice, wheat, and other grains from the inland, affecting the people's livelihood, which is no small matter, has organized a grain transportation and sales company of a relatively large scale. However, this matter is of great importance and requires careful planning.</p>

The establishment of a city and government requires the proper establishment of regulations. You, sir, with your great reputation, came to preside over industry and commerce, firmly upholding the overall situation, and taking measures with peace and order. You followed the rules and regulations, comparable to a hall. You spent half your life on horseback, secretly harming your body and spirit. You have been bedridden for years, like Ji An in Huaiyang. Mount Lu is bright and beautiful, a scenic spot for immortals. You moved to nourish your illness, choosing a better place. We hoped for your recovery, comforting this side.

In times of chaos, you carried your strategy far and righteously, boarding a chariot and surveying the territory, and投明 (Tou Ming) for thousands of miles. You followed the army to the Lingbiao region, and sent messages to Beijing. You swept across the land, and the world became clear. You served as a public servant, and repeatedly received special honors. You 分藩滬凟 (Fen Fan Hu Du), and opened a government in Wancheng. Your virtuous administration remains on the stele, and your path is followed. How could we have expected the 二豎 (Er Shu) to be so deeply ingrained, nourishing your illness in Mount Lu, and suddenly 言薨 (Yan Hong)? The news spread, and the city and fields were shocked.

<p>According to the Dagon Press, the Ministry of Communications has decided to officially open the nine-province long-distance telephone network for communication on September 15. The Nanjing-Hankou-Peixian radio station is also being built actively. Domestic and foreign wireless telephones are required to be connected with various countries by the spring of next year. The following is a report from the Dagon Press reporter:</p>
<p>Nine-Province Telephone: The long-distance telephone network of the Ministry of Communications, covering nine provinces and cities including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and Shanghai, has been completed for the five major trunk lines of Nanjing-Shanghai, Nanjing-Hankou, Nanjing-Tianjin, Jinan-Qingdao, and Beiping-Hankou. Several trial calls have been made in stages, with good results. Branch lines are currently being built. According to sources from the Shanghai transportation authorities, the nine-province long-distance telephone network is scheduled to be fully opened for communication on September 15. At that time, Minister Yu will preside over the communication ceremony in Nanjing and report on the construction process.</p>
<p>Nanjing-Hankou Radio Station: The audio amplification radio station for improving long-distance telephone equipment is located in Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou. Except for the Shanghai amplification station, which has been completed, the radio stations in Nanjing and Hankou have also been completed one after another. The audio amplifier is still being configured, and it is expected to be completed by the beginning of next month. Then, it will be used to exchange tests with the Shanghai amplification station.</p>
<p>Completion Required: Regarding the Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangzhou domestic wireless telephones, trial calls have been opened in Shanghai and Hankou. The official communication period and communication fees are being stipulated by the Ministry of Communications. As for Guangdong, since the Ministry of Communications sent personnel to organize it, the construction of the wireless telephone project has been actively accelerated. In addition, the international wireless telephones in various countries such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Philippines have been ordered by the International Radio Station to handle communications by February next year. New two-way telephones and telegraphs will continue to be purchased.</p>

<p>First batch transported over one hundred tons</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi Press, since our country announced the lifting of sanctions against Italy on July 15, following the resolution of the League of Nations Executive Yuan, Sino-Italian trade has gradually returned to normal in the past half month. Italian goods exported to China, in addition to heavy industrial machinery, etc., are mainly artificial silk and olive oil. Our country's exports to Italy are mainly sesame, ramie, lime, and tung oil. Recently, the Italian ship "Victoria" exported sesame and other miscellaneous goods, reaching more than one hundred tons, which is a proof of the improvement of Sino-Italian trade relations after the lifting of sanctions against Italy.</p>

Therefore, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been stepping up its investigation work in recent days. In order to assist the government in eliminating the atmosphere of opium, the Municipal Anti-Opium Committee has dispatched staff to various districts to carry out guidance, hoping that smokers will register as soon as possible or apply for admission to the hospital for treatment, so as to avoid criminal penalties. According to the report of the Smoker Registration Section of the Fourth Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, more than 200 smokers apply for registration every day last week.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Ziti Municipal Coordination Association Established <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Ziti Town in West Shanghai (Zhudi) is under the jurisdiction of the Pusong District of Shanghai. Since the abolition of the Pusong Municipal Committee Office, although all municipal affairs have been directly handled by various municipal bureaus, it is inevitable that they cannot be reached due to the distance from Shanghai, resulting in the stagnation of construction in recent years. In view of this, the gentry of the town, Hou Shuda and Huang Chengbo, initiated the organization of the Ziti Municipal Coordination Association. Their call was met with enthusiastic responses and won the support of all sectors. After two months of preparation, it was officially established yesterday. Dozens of representatives from all sectors attended, and Hou Shuda, Hou Jilan, Huang Chengbo, Zhu Jinshu, Zhu Qinyuan, Ling Youjun, Tang Botao, Huang Shunbin, and Huang Shichang were elected as executive committee members on the spot. Hou Cheng, Zhang Danquan, Zhang Chunlin, Zai Jiefu, and Shen Meisun were elected as supervisory committee members. Hou Shuda, Hou Jilan, and Huang Chengbo were elected as standing committee members of the executive committee. Ling Youjun also served as the director of the secretariat, Zhu Qinyuan also served as the director of general affairs, Zhu Jinshu also served as the director of design, Tang Botao also served as the director of publicity, and Qian Kunfu served as the general manager. Three important cases were resolved on the spot: (A) Reporting to the party and government organs for record; (B) Submitting to the municipal authorities; (1) Requesting the repair of Pucao Zhai Road, (2) Dredging the Panlong River, which has been neglected for a long time, and (3) Constructing a prosperous bridge across the center; (C) Organizing a fundraising team, with Hou Junren as the commander, to raise funds to ensure its permanence. It was also recommended that Hou Shuda and Huang Chengbo draft the declaration, and work will begin immediately. From then on, the municipal construction of Zhudi will have a thriving image.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Accountant Shen Liren Discusses <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports: Yesterday, accountant Shen Liren presented his opinions on accounting issues following the implementation of income tax in our country. He offered many suggestions, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>Accounting Relationship</p>
<p>Our country's income tax will be levied starting next month. According to the provisional regulations on income tax promulgated by the national government, the taxation of for-profit businesses such as companies and firms is based on the ratio of capital to net profit. The determination of net profit is based on the income statement, and the figures in the income statement come from all account books. If the records in the account books do not match the facts, the calculation of net profit will inevitably be inaccurate, and the principle of fairness in taxation will be lost. Therefore, the quality of the accounting system of various businesses is closely related to the collection of income tax, which is obviously a logical conclusion. In the income tax laws and regulations of European and American countries, there are generally no restrictions on the accounting systems of various industries. This is because, although the accounting systems are not perfect, due to the widespread knowledge of accounting and the large number of accounting talents, the greatest force comes from schools and textbooks, so they have mostly become systematic. Each business has a unified accounting system that can be adopted. In contrast, in our country, except for banks, railways, and the government, which have unified accounting systems, other industrial and commercial enterprises, except for a small number, are chaotic and without any systematic organization. At the beginning of income tax collection, those in charge of various for-profit businesses will inevitably have two types of hesitations. One type is that although their business has a set accounting system, they are unsure whether it will pass inspection when they submit tax returns, and whether disputes will arise. They are also unsure whether their account books fully comply with the facts. The other type mainly consists of sole proprietorships or freelancers, where all income and expenses are managed by the owner personally. There is no need for an accounting system in the first place. Now, due to the collection of income tax, they must have detailed account books as the basis for filling out income tax returns, and they will inevitably have to establish an accounting system. However, how to establish it, and what the costs will be after its establishment, so that they do not suddenly increase, are all questions that cannot be easily resolved.</p>
<p>Innovating the System</p>
<p>It has been observed that the development of accounting in other countries has been promoted in part by the collection of income tax. Therefore, when our country implements this new tax, it is imperative to make a systematic reform of the accounting system for industry and commerce. The benefit is that it can promote the national industry in a big way, and reduce the occurrence of disputes during income tax collection in a small way. Therefore, I believe that the direct tax collection agency should hire those with rich experience and knowledge in accounting to organize an accounting system research association, divided into three groups: one for researching accounting subjects, one for researching account book formats, and another for researching fraud prevention methods. The current accounting subjects in our country, except for those stipulated by banks, railways, and government agencies, are mostly selected and created by various businesses themselves. It is often difficult for others to understand their meaning. Ordinary old-fashioned stores traditionally use auspicious phrases as the names of their account books, such as "taking righteousness as profit" to replace the final accounts report, and "bumper harvest" to replace sales, etc. As for new-style accountants, because what they have learned is all from English textbooks (mostly produced in the United States), the names of the subjects are mostly directly translated from English, such as "Accounts Receivable" translated as "應收賬項" (Yīngshōu zhàng xiàng, receivables), and "Surplus" translated as "盈餘" (Yíngyú, surplus). However, upon actual examination, subjects such as "Accounts Receivable" and "Surplus" were originally not very appropriate in English itself. They are only used because they have become customary. Our country does not research them and translates and uses them arbitrarily, which is even more erroneous. The research association should select the commonly used accounting subjects in our country, unify their names, and avoid discrepancies.</p>
<p>Unifying Account Books</p>
<p>The formats of various account books should vary depending on the nature of the business. However, ordinary basic account books, such as the journal, general ledger, and cash book, have the possibility of being unified. The research association should design the formats of these account books for the main industries for reference. As for books such as purchase and sales books, which must be changed according to the characteristics of the facts, they can be designed by hired accountants. In our country today, old-fashioned stores mostly continue to use the original Chinese account book formats. Newer stores either adopt the improved Chinese bookkeeping system of the transitional period or directly use the Western system. The so-called Western system is usually the British and American system, because those currently engaged in accounting work read English textbooks or English translations. Posting from various original books is done separately. However, what is actually used is also based on the continental system, emphasizing the journalized detailed book. The establishment of our country's accounting system originated in banks, and at that time, the Japanese banking system was used as a blueprint. The Japanese used the continental system. For this reason, modern accounting courses are often different from what is actually used. If the accounting system research association can be established and can formulate accounting systems for various industries, then various accounting textbooks must be rewritten to comply with laws and regulations. The fraud prevention methods research group specializes in researching internal controls for various transactions. Most industrial and commercial enterprises in our country employ many people, but due to the lack of a good internal control organization, fraud and errors cannot be prevented. If a slight change is made to comply with the principles of control, no expenses will be increased, and good results can be achieved.</p>
<p>Remedial Measures</p>
<p>The above is a description of the research work to be done on the accounting system in the future. However, since income tax will be levied soon, it is urgently necessary to determine a remedial method for businesses that do not yet have a good accounting system. Now, I will briefly present my views as follows. The businesses that urgently need remediation can still be divided into two categories, as mentioned earlier: one is those that already have an accounting system but it is not very suitable, and the other is those that have no accounting system at all. The former mainly consists of industrial and commercial enterprises, while the latter mostly consists of freelancers. First, let us discuss those with an existing accounting system. There are two preconditions for its improvement: first, not to increase expenses; and second, not to change the original staff. The method of improvement can still be carried out according to the principles of design. Now, I will describe them as follows: (1) Subject names: The government has previously promulgated a translated name for accounting subjects in our country, but it was only a small part. It can be used as a basis, and the same subjects that have been stipulated in the accounting of banks, railways, and the government can be used. The time for the change should be at the end of the month. (2) Fraud prevention methods: Depending on the number of employees used by the business, and within the possible scope, assign duties to the original staff and stipulate their responsibilities. Ensure that each transaction must be handled by at least two people so that they can check and balance each other. (3) Account book format: The account book format can be temporarily unchanged. However, it is necessary to investigate whether there is evidence of transaction records, from various documents to the account books, from the various account books to the general ledger, whether there are errors in the procedures, whether a third party can audit, and whether it is convenient to prepare reports from the general ledger. Those that do not meet these points should be reformed. As for businesses that have no account books, they should keep all receipts of income and expenses from the date of income tax collection and set up a diary book to record each day's transactions, separating debits and credits. Anyone with basic bookkeeping knowledge can do this. Other books can be temporarily not established. Furthermore, I believe that the income tax collection agency should adopt the continental system for account books, which is a point that can be researched. As stipulated by countries such as France and Italy, the journalized diary book is the statutory account book, and other original books are auxiliary journals. This is mostly the case with our country's existing accounting system, which can save the labor of changing. It can also be more systematic when auditing accounts.</p>

<p>At the Yangtze Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Yunnan Road, a young woman checked in the night before last. She claimed to be Wang Baozhen, 20 years old, from Shanghai, and requested room number 70 for her stay. Unexpectedly, around 6 a.m. yesterday, the tea server on the floor suddenly discovered that the woman had committed suicide by poison in the room. He immediately reported it to the police station, and they rushed her to the hospital for treatment. Because the throat wound was too severe, she was still unable to speak after regaining consciousness. Afterwards, police detectives found two suicide notes and a bottle of liquid in her room. They are currently searching for and notifying her family.</p>
<h3 id="e92">One Rain Makes It Autumn, Summer Scenery Has Faded <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Clouds linger, the weather is cool and pleasant; a new hurricane is about to disturb Fujian and Guangdong.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn on the eighth of this month, the climate in this city has been hot and humid, even more so than during the hottest days of summer. The temperature at noon often reaches 96 or 97 degrees, giving residents throughout the city the feeling of being in a furnace. However, the night before last (the 14th), there was a torrential downpour, and the heat immediately dissipated after the rain. Yesterday, it became even cooler and more pleasant. The highest temperature at noon was 90.05 degrees, and the sky was filled with lingering clouds, making it feel very unstable. According to reporters' inquiries at various epidemic hospitals, summer epidemics have greatly decreased. Sales of cold drinks in the market have also greatly decreased. The summer scenery is gradually fading away, and there is truly an atmosphere of one rain making it autumn. The first hurricane that arose in the Pacific Ocean has diminished after moving west through the Guangzhou Bay. According to the observatory's report at 2 p.m. yesterday, the second hurricane that newly arose in Peleliu Island has reached between 20 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude. The center of the hurricane is within 60 nautical miles of the reported direction, heading northwest by west, with very strong winds. If the direction does not change, there is a possibility of it disturbing the sea off Fujian and Guangdong.</p>

<p>The New News Agency reports that the shantytown residents of the Pudong and Puxi districts of this city held the inaugural meeting of the All-City Shantytown United Association at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Xizang Road at 2 p.m. yesterday. Twenty-nine executive committee members were elected, and many important motions were resolved. A declaration was issued to announce to all sectors, and the Municipal Federation Association was temporarily borrowed as the office of the general association. They will start working immediately. Details are listed below.</p>
<p>Representatives Attending</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included representatives of the shantytowns on Yanshan Road, Chaoyang Road, Huishan Road, Lan Road, Qiwupu Road, Linping Road in the Pudong district, and Tokyo Road, Changping Road, Mabal Road, Putuo Road, Haifang Road, Guanchang Road, etc. in the Puxi district: Jia Zidong, Tang Anping, Xu Xiyuan, Zhang Sheyun, Sun Xudan, Zhu Jinsheng, Zhang Ziying, Wang Guiwen, and Chen Jiufeng, a representative of the First Special District Citizen United Association, as well as Ye Qichang, Pan Zhenxiang, and others from various district branches, totaling over 500 people. Zhu Qitai, Tang Anping, and Hu Yumen were publicly elected as the presidium of the meeting, and Zhang Zhiseng recorded.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony was performed, Chairman Tang Anping first gave a report, briefly stating: "Today, we are holding the inaugural meeting of the Shantytown United Association. We are very honored by your presence. At this time of industrial and commercial decline and economic depression, driven by the need for survival, we can only build shacks to barely shelter ourselves from the wind and rain. Now, the Municipal Council is not understanding our suffering and has ordered us to tear them down. If this is implemented, we will become homeless. Therefore, we have braved the dangers to appeal and petition, and fortunately, we have received sympathy and assistance from all sectors. Today's inaugural meeting is to show our success in uniting. We hope that you will uphold the current spirit and continue to work hard to achieve our goal of unity and common welfare." Hu Yumen then continued to report on the actual situation in the Puxi district, and the long speech is omitted.</p>
<p>Representatives' Speeches</p>
<p>Chen Jiufeng, representative of the First Special District Citizen United Association, said: "Today, your association is holding its inaugural meeting, and I, as a representative of the Citizen Association, am very honored to participate in this grand event. I am very pleased to see so many representatives attending today, with such enthusiasm. The Western philosopher said, 'The greater the oppression, the greater the resistance.' Today's situation is enough to prove that the Municipal Council, in the name of tidying up the city appearance, is ordering demolition without considering the lives of shantytown residents. Moreover, tidying up the city appearance should start with the downtown area. Look at the decline of Nanjing Road, but the Municipal Council is not trying to restore its prosperity. It can be seen that the Municipal Council's handling is not appropriate. Furthermore, tidying up the city appearance must also take into account the lives of ordinary people and should start from the root. The shantytown residents build shacks entirely because they are unable to afford the expensive rents, so they use them to avoid the wind and rain. Now that the United Association is established, it is to reasonably argue with the Municipal Council under a common and unified goal and request exemption from demolition. If they only issue strict demolition orders, resistance will be unavoidable. Therefore, the Citizen Association has repeatedly sent letters to the Municipal Council suggesting building affordable housing to settle the shantytown residents and to tidy the city. As for your association collecting membership fees, some people have reported it. However, I hope that you staff members will understand your own positions, be honest and self-respecting, and work hard for the public good. In terms of expenses, you should strive to save money and not leave room for criticism. As for saboteurs, you should thoroughly investigate them and punish them to warn the malicious. Furthermore, public training is currently being held. All shantytown residents are sound citizens, so they should all participate together and not fail in their national duties. After the United Association is established, it is hoped that you will gradually carry out negotiations on the exemption of shantytowns from demolition, promotion of hygiene work, and running literacy schools, etc., to achieve the goal of common welfare."</p>
<p>Motions Resolved</p>
<p>(1) Request the Municipal Council to exempt shantytowns from demolition: (Resolved) (A) In the name of the association, send a letter to the Municipal Council requesting consideration of the difficulties in the lives of ordinary people and granting exemption from demolition for existing shantytowns.

<p>Issuing a Declaration</p>
<p>The association issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "Because of the establishment of the United Association, the shantytown residents throughout the city will help each other in times of trouble, and the unity will be further consolidated. Our initiation of the United Association has two purposes: negative and positive. On the negative side, we do not avoid saying that we want to solve a kind of unreasonable oppression from external forces. On the positive side, we want to practice autonomy, self-improvement, and ceaseless effort to be a member who benefits society and the country. To the best of our ability, we will first conduct literacy education and hygiene movements, in order to eliminate illiteracy and strengthen physical fitness, and to establish joint security to reduce the authorities' concerns about public order. In short, we strive to be progressive, but our knowledge is limited, and our abilities are limited. We still hope that compatriots from all walks of life will give us sympathy and guidance."</p>

<p>Ximen Detective Team Arrests Three</p>
<p>Around 9 p.m. the night before last, Liu Guangjun, captain of the Ximen Sub-bureau's detective team, received a secret report from an informant stating that a large group of bandits were secretly conferring at Wang Xuezheng's house on the rear floor of 570 Xietu Road in the Nanshi area, planning to set off to rob somewhere. He immediately led team leaders Yu Ruhai, detectives Chen Miantong, Huang Shouxin, Chen Mingsheng, and other detectives, all disguised, and accompanied the informant to the house. They first surrounded the house on all sides and then rushed into the house. Just as the thieves finished their meeting and were coming downstairs, they were able to arrest Wang Wanlong (33 years old) from Taizhou, Zhu Youming (29 years old), Wang Jiagui (30 years old), and three others. A revolver and two bullets were found on Zhu. They then led the team to interrogate them separately. According to the thieves, they were discussing setting off to rob the Tongxing Sock Factory on Liyuan Road and the North China Transportation Company within two days, where there were 2,000 yuan in wages to be robbed. They then confessed that their fellow villager Shi Liuba, 27 years old, worked as a barber in the North China Transportation Company. The detectives then led the thieves to a thatched shed at the North China Transportation wharf overnight and captured Shi Liuba. Yesterday morning, they interrogated the suspects again and they also confessed that on the 7th of last month, they had conspired to rob Chen Changsen, foreman of the China Cement Company at 1 Xijichang West Road in Caohejing, of 160 yuan, and had often hit Chen in the head with a gun butt. This was arranged by Er Mazi, who set up the robbery on the road. Captain Liu verified the confessions. As the case involved conspiracy to rob, he sent the four suspects along with the gun and bullets to the Ximen Sub-bureau. Chief Yao briefly questioned them and, because the case was important, ordered that a document be prepared and submitted to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e96">High Tide Starting Last Night on the Huangpu River for Three Days <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Only Inches Away From the Bund Embankment; Tide Water May Overflow the Bank; Yong'an's Side Road Is Filled Higher</p>
<p>According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the highest tide levels on the Huangpu River since the 13th of this month will be the night tides of the past, present and next three days, which are very close to the embankments. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>High Tide Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau's prediction, the high tide level on the Huangpu River at 11:45 p.m. on the 16th was 12 feet 6.5 inches. At 12:18 a.m. on the 17th, the high tide level was 12 feet 5.4 inches. At 12:51 a.m. on the 18th, the high tide level was 12 feet 8 inches. The Bund embankment is 13 feet high, and the water level is only four inches to two inches away from the embankment. Therefore, not only will the low-lying roads be flooded, but there is also the possibility of water overflowing the embankment at the low points, which should be noted.</p>
<p>Low Road Filled Higher</p>
<p>The especially low section of the road on the side of the Wing On Company at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road has always been flooded during high tide periods, causing water accumulation and greatly hindering traffic. Therefore, the Municipal Council specially sent workers to fill the road surface by two feet last month. The same was done on the section of Jiujiang Road from Hubei Road in the east to Zhejiang Road in the west. This project has now been completed. It is reported that the Engineering Department will also fill other especially low roads.</p>

<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association believes that the Buddhist associations at all levels throughout the country are religious organizations. According to the association's constitution, they naturally have considerable responsibility and authority for the enforcement of religious rules, the propagation of religious doctrines, the handling of charitable and public welfare matters, and the supervision and management of temple property. However, some local governments mistakenly believe that the Buddhist association is a cultural organization and only order it to study religious doctrines, not allowing it to inquire about the temple property that has been occupied or to organize various religious affairs. It has specially submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior to order the civil affairs departments of all provinces to inform their subordinates to take note of this. It is reported that the association has now received an approval from the Ministry of Interior to issue a notice.</p>

<p>Li Jiusheng, from Jiangxi, was walking near Liaoyang Road, Tangshan Road, at 7:35 PM on the 5th of this month, when Meng Zhaohua and Meng Zhaogui, brothers from Taixing, were enjoying the cool air there. They were carelessly catching dragonflies, and the bamboo pole accidentally struck Li's head, leading to a dispute. Subsequently, both sides called upon dozens of fellow townsmen, wielding iron rods and spears, resulting in a brawl. As a result, Feng Kaizhu, a thug from the Taixing gang, was stabbed in the chest with a spear by the Jiangxi side and fell to the ground, barely breathing. Yu Lin Road Police Station's Western Detective, Mr. Whithower, Detective Li Hongsheng, and Chinese Constables No. 2018 and No. 1364 rushed to the scene upon hearing the alarm, arrested Li, and collected three spears from the ground, taking them all to the police station and transferring them to the First Special District Court. Because the victim was in St. Luke's Hospital, his injuries were severe, and he was unable to testify in court, so it was decided to postpone the trial, and the defendant Li was remanded in custody. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefen arrived at the Third Criminal Court for a continuation of the trial. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu, of the Municipal Council, stated that the victim, Deng Kaizhu, had been unconscious since entering the hospital and had not spoken a word to this day. According to the doctor, there was no immediate danger to his life, and he would recover in two weeks. He was carried to the courtroom on a bed.

He was ordered to be sent to the forensic doctor's office to examine the injuries to determine if there were any dangerous changes. Li Jiusheng was remanded in custody pending an indefinite trial.</p>

<h3 id="e109">News of the Xu-Pan Litigation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Xu Bozhang, from Minhou, Fujian, 40 years old, has been engaged in the glass factory business in Shanghai for many years. In the tenth year of the Republic [1921], he married Wang Aiyu (35 years old this year) in his hometown and lived in the countryside. Because Xu was doing business in Shanghai, he was not accustomed to sleeping alone. On September 14, 1934, through the introduction of friends Yang Zhifang and Wang Shuying, he married Pan Jingyu (21 years old this year), a woman from Changzhou, as his wife. After their wedding at the Oriental Hotel, they rented a house and lived together at No. 50, Fengyu Lane, Rue Saussier in the French Concession. In October of the following year, a daughter was born, named Dezhen. However, when Xu married Pan, he did not mention his wife in his hometown. In mid-March of this year, Xu's wife, Wang Aiyu, came to Shanghai from Fujian. Xu rented Room 22 of the Dacheng Apartments on Rue Paul Beau and lived with Wang. His feelings for Pan gradually faded from then on, and he cut off her living expenses. Pan found out that Xu had a new lover and was living with her outside. After discovering their address, she was unwilling to accept it. Therefore, on April 1, Pan reported to the French police station that her husband was committing adultery with someone in the apartment. Detectives were dispatched to Dacheng Apartments and arrested Xu and Wang Aiyu. After the police chief learned that they were a legally married couple, no public prosecution was initiated. Pan Jingyu then accused Xu Bozhang of bigamy and abandonment. The police station sent Xu to the Second Special District Court for prosecution according to the law. After Judge Li Changnian's trial, he believed that the statute of limitations had passed and did not convict him. After Xu was released, Wang Aiyu independently hired a lawyer and filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, accusing Pan Jingyu of obstructing freedom and defamation, and attached a civil lawsuit seeking 1,000 yuan in damages for mental and reputational losses. Judge Li Changnian also summoned both parties for trial. The result of the trial was that the fault lay with Xu Bozhang, and there was no reason for the plaintiff's claims. Pan Jingyu was found not guilty. Wang Aiyu refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Judge Liao of the High Court arrived at the Second Criminal Court to investigate and question the appellant and the appellee. Both were accompanied by lawyers. After the court questioned them, and the two sides stated the circumstances of the case, the court ordered the hearing to be postponed to the morning of the 29th. However, after Pan Jingyu's criminal case against Xu Bozhang failed, she filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court for damages for support. Because Xu's whereabouts were unknown, the case was still pending.</p>

<p>Wu Sichang, 40 years old, from Suqian, came to Shanghai last year to make a living due to the difficult life in his hometown. He was introduced by a friend to work at the Tongchang Silk Store in Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at around 10 AM yesterday, in his residence at Chenjiadu, Binbei, he was overwhelmed by the monotony of life and conceived a desire to end his life. Behind people's backs, he swallowed poison in an attempt to commit suicide. He was discovered by his friend Zhang Fenyun, who immediately reported to the Caojiadu Branch and transported Wu Sichang to the Red Cross Hospital on Avenue Haig for treatment. Because the poisoning was too deep, it was impossible to save him, so he died upon arrival at the hospital.</p>

<p>Chen Ada, a 58-year-old Wuxi native, trades in foreign goods and lives at No. 5, Huacao Lane, within the city. A friend, Wang Jianlin (51 years old, from Nantong), introduced Ding Panshi's (from Yixing, living at No. 3, Xiaozha Bridge) son, Ding Longshun (19 years old), to Chen to learn the trade. Suddenly, he ran away on the seventh day of the sixth lunar month, and stole a gong worth more than six yuan. Chen was unable to find him and reported to the Yemiao Police Station for filing and notified the original introducer and family members. Unexpectedly, Ding Panshi repeatedly demanded her son from Chen. Chen was so harassed that he printed and posted 20-yuan reward posters on the main streets to find him. Unexpectedly, Ding Longshun was hidden at home by his mother. When she saw the reward poster, she ordered her son to go to Chen and falsely claim that he had been found by a police officer from the Xiaonanmen Police Station and had come to claim the reward. Chen, seeing that the police officer had not come to claim the reward, suspected that he was falsely impersonating a public official and colluding in a fraud to extort money. He immediately twisted the mother and son to the police station for investigation. After questioning by Officer Chen, it was determined that the case involved collusion, impersonation, and extortion. They were ordered to be sent to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Recently, there have been many coolies who became addicted to opium due to illness in the past and are unable to quit, or who inject morphine, or take heroin, both of which are cheap. They willingly tread the path of the law and are unwilling to go to the hospital to quit. Many have been arrested and sent to court for sentencing.

Because Shi made a mistake, Hou questioned him. Shi spoke disrespectfully, and Liu Weiqu defended him, striking Shi's left forehead with an iron rod, causing injury and bleeding. The Shagang police saw this and arrested them together. After questioning, the case was turned over to the bureau for investigation as it involved assault.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Young Photographic Reporter Chen Jiazhen Passed Away Yesterday Morning <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The young photographic reporter Chen Jiazhen had an extremely detached style and a very fresh perspective. Therefore, his works were extremely welcomed by society. However, due to accumulated overwork, he fell ill and sought medical treatment repeatedly, but it was ineffective. This was when the rumors that Chen had disappeared began to circulate. At the beginning of this month, Chen's friends, including Lin Zecang, transferred him from the Taijia Hospital to the Tuberculosis Isolation and Treatment Department of the Hongqiao Sanitarium in West Shanghai. After diagnosis by the hospital's doctors using X-rays, it was determined that he had caseous pneumonia of both lungs and was diagnosed as incurable. After admission, the treatment process was very good. Chen's friends hoped that he would recover without medication. However, he eventually died of heart failure and exhaustion at 5:10 AM yesterday. The world of photography has lost another talent. The remains were sent to the Shanghai Funeral Home for embalming. According to the attending physician at the hospital, Chen's lung disease was discovered too late, and he lost the opportunity for proper treatment. After it was discovered, he took too much medicine, hoping for a lucky recovery, which delayed the time and the disease became incurable. This is a formula for the rampant spread of lung disease in our country. Chen was such a talented young man, and yet this happened. How many such tragedies are staged every year among the general public with no common sense? The only way to remedy this is to promote X-rays, early diagnosis, and detect this type of asymptomatic tuberculosis, and then apply proper treatment. Sixty-seven to eighty-five percent of cases can be expected to be cured and their lives saved. However, this proper treatment is quite interesting in our country's situation. According to research by experts from various countries, the first thing to do is to abandon superstitious prescriptions, which are regarded by patients in our country as life-saving medicine. The second thing to understand is that in addition to the four major supplementary therapies of sunlight, air, rest, and nutrition, there is also a more reliable surgical treatment, which can not only shorten the treatment time, save the patient's economy, eradicate the root cause of the disease, and reduce the risk of infection, directly improving personal health and family happiness, but also indirectly contributing to social construction and national productivity. In short, the reason why there are so many lung diseases in our country is that too many people believe in medicine. If the life of each patient is extended by one to three years, the total amount of medical expenses, calculated nationwide, will be greater than the cost of any national construction project. The reason why lung diseases have decreased in various countries, such as in the United States, where lung disease has decreased from the leading cause of death to the seventh, is due to the popularization of this proper treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Ye Gongchuo Requests Preservation of the Ming Dynasty Zhengtong Edition of the Buddhist Canon: Shipped from Ruifan Temple in Pixian County to Shanghai for Storage at the Local Buddhist Artifact Preservation Museum <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, Ye Gongchuo, the director of the Shanghai Buddhist Artifact Preservation Museum at No. 418, Hart Road, requested that the Ming Dynasty Zhengtong edition of the Buddhist canon stored in Ruixiang Temple on Mount Suyang in Pixian County be transported to Shanghai for preservation at the museum to avoid desecration. He sent a letter to the Buddhist Association of China stating that the Ruixiang Temple on Mount Suyang in Pixian County has a collection of the Ming Dynasty Zhengtong edition of the Buddhist canon. Due to poor management in recent years, much of it has been lost. There are currently 2,935 volumes of Sanskrit text and 338 volumes of Qian text. If no measures are taken to preserve it, this Buddhist scripture will inevitably be lost, which is a great pity. Our museum, for the purpose of preserving Buddhist artifacts, intends to find a way to transport it to Shanghai for proper preservation. We have reached an agreement with the abbot of the temple and have consulted with the Pixian County Government to temporarily store the scriptures in the government office. Accordingly, we are writing to your association for approval, and we ask that you inform the Pixian County Government to investigate. Please pack and seal all the books and transport them to our museum at No. 418, Hart Road, Shanghai. Our museum will be responsible for reimbursing all transportation costs. The association has forwarded a letter to the Pixian County Government to have all of the scriptures transported to Shanghai for preservation.</p>

Initially, their relationship was very good, and she secretly accumulated more than 190 yuan, which he gradually spent. Last year, she gave birth to a daughter. This year, Song Dasan suddenly abandoned her. She was both ashamed of her loss of chastity and pained by the loss of money. Yesterday morning, she went to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai on Xizang Road to recount her story, and she could not help but burst into tears. The association, after hearing her story, specially sent Wang Aifu to mediate the situation and calm her anger.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Shanghai's Film Industry <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by Editor Zhengzhu</p>
<p>(Part 34 of Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Overview)</p>
<p>(1) Introduction: The Chinese film industry has existed for nearly twenty years. Over these twenty years, the majority (90%) of film studios and management companies have been concentrated in Shanghai. Therefore, the situation of this industry in Shanghai can be representative of the whole country. The Chinese film industry, like other national industries, has suffered from the oppression of foreign films for twenty years and still struggles beneath their shadow, facing countless crises that are difficult to describe. The main reasons for its survival and continued hope for significant development are advancements in technology and government encouragement.</p>
<p>The film industry in Shanghai can be broadly divided into three categories: production, management, and cinemas. There has been no foreign investment in film production. Although some foreigners have attempted to establish factories in Shanghai, they have ultimately failed due to various reasons. Management and cinemas, however, are mostly controlled by foreigners. For example, the "Big Eight" American film companies in Shanghai almost completely control the film distribution business, dominating the entire market.</p>
<p>This article aims to outline the history and current status of film production and management, incorporating cinemas into the film market section. They will be described separately below.</p>
<p>(2) History: In 190X, American Mr. Blashki organized the Asia Film Company in Shanghai, producing the films "Empress Dowager Cixi" and "The Unfortunate Son." In 191X, American Mr. Ischler traveled to China during the thriving period of modern drama. Ischler collaborated with people in the modern drama industry, utilizing the actors, costumes, and sets of modern drama to produce the films "Zhuangzi Breaking Open the Coffin" and "The Unjust Soul of the Black Register." However, the plots were unremarkable, and the acting was poor. The only reason for their popularity was the novelty of motion pictures. Both companies closed after the outbreak of the European War.</p>
<p>In 191X, the Commercial Press established a film department, engaging in the production of educational and scenic short films, marking the beginning of domestic film production. The following year, Universal Pictures Corp. of America came to Shanghai to produce films, hoping to compete with the Commercial Press. In 191X, Gu Xianfu, Guan Haifeng, and others organized the New Asia Company, producing "Red Pink Skull." However, Du Yu and others organized the Shanghai Company, producing "Sea Oath." The following year, Zheng Zhegu (deceased), Zheng Zhengqiu (deceased), Zhang Shichuan, Zhou Jianyun, Ren Jinping, and others organized the Star Film Company, producing short comedic films, followed by the film "Retribution is Clear." This marked the beginning of formal film production companies in China.</p>
<p>In 192X, more companies were established, including Great China, Great Wall, Lily, Great Shanghai, and New China. In 192X, the Tianyi Company was established by the Shao Zuiweng brothers. At that time, film companies emerged like bamboo shoots after rain. Seventeen more companies were subsequently established, including Shenzhou, United Friends, and New Youth. In the same year, Great China and Lily merged to form Great China Lily. By this time, the film industry was gradually prospering. In 192X, the film department of the Commercial Press was reorganized into the Guoguang Company. Ren Jinping left Star and formed his own Newcomer Company. In addition, thirteen more companies were established, including Minxin and Huaju. Although there were many companies in these years, they rose and fell quickly. Most of them closed down shortly after, or only existed in name without producing any films. As a result, internal conflicts in the film industry intensified, plunging the entire industry into a chaotic era. Since the establishment of the Film Censorship Board, small companies were gradually eliminated. After 192X, the industry began to get back on track. Great China Lily and Minxin merged again, officially establishing the Lianhua Film Company on October 15, 193X, revitalizing the film industry.</p>
<p>During this period, a few foreigners attempted to establish film production plants in China. For example, in 192X, the British American Tobacco Company had a film investment plan. In 193X, a Sino-foreign joint venture established the China First Company. In the same year, a foreigner named Betly Conepson attempted to establish a Sino-foreign company. However, due to the well-organized domestic film industry, foreign capital could not penetrate it. Government guidance also played a significant role.</p>
<p>According to the Ministry of Industry's report, there were 37 film companies in Shanghai by 193X. Among them, only Star, Lianhua, and Tianyi were relatively large. Most companies had suspended operations due to the January 28th Incident. By 193X, only a dozen companies remained. In 193X, Yi Hua was established. In 193X, more companies were established, including Diantong, Xinhua, and Yucheng. In the current year, Diantong and Yucheng have closed, and new companies such as Xinhua and Culture have been established. According to Lianhua Company statistics, there are currently eleven film companies in Shanghai, with seven actually producing films. This is a general overview of the film production industry in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Most of the existing technical personnel in the Shanghai film industry, such as cameramen and set designers, are not specialists. Their current achievements are mainly derived from experience. Notable achievements include the production of sound films and Star Company's attempt at color films. In 192X, imported sound films were introduced to China, and major cinemas in Shanghai gradually screened them. Film studios collectively considered producing sound films. However, due to high costs and lack of talent, it was difficult to implement. Therefore, they first produced phonograph records for dubbing, such as Lianhua's "Wild Grasses and Idle Flowers," Star's "Singing Girl Red Peony," and United Friends' "Yu Meiren." Later, Chen Qiufeng and others organized a company to go to Japan to produce "After the Rain, Clear Sky." In 193X, Tianyi began producing sound films with sound-on-film technology, "Singing Arena Spring." This marked the beginning of sound films with sound directly on the film in China. Star Company also sent Professor Hong Shen to the United States to purchase sound equipment and hired two sound engineers, producing films such as "Flesh Market." At the same time, more and more Chinese people invented sound equipment, such as Shi Shiqing's "Eastone," Yan Hemian's "Hemingtone," and Zhu Qingxian's "Qingxian Type." With this, sound recording technology no longer relied entirely on foreigners, and the production of sound films became more widespread. Currently, there are eight companies in Shanghai that produce and sell sound equipment, but most are used by cinemas. In 193X, Star Company, recognizing the popularity of color films, filmed a portion of "Tears and Laughter Marriage" in color. However, due to poor technology and high costs, there have been no successors. The Star authorities have also abandoned this attempt. Other advancements, such as the Wan brothers' invention of self-made animated cartoons, are also a significant step forward in film technology.</p>
<p>It is also necessary to mention the import and competition of foreign films. Foreign films have been well-received in Shanghai since their arrival in 190X. A Spaniard named Remas first opened the Rosam' Vo toria (now renamed New Central) cinema in Shanghai, as well as Summer Peck, Aipro, and others. At that time, there were almost no domestic films. Not only were all films screened foreign films, but all cinemas were also opened by foreigners. Later, with the establishment of Star Company and the emergence of domestic films, the Central Company was organized to manage five cinemas: Central, New Central, Carde, International, and Empire, exclusively screening domestic films. At that time, the business comparison between domestic and foreign films was only 5 to 95. In 192X, various American film companies, such as Paramount and Fox, came to China to establish branches, controlling the Shanghai film market. In the same year, sound films began to be screened in China. However, the result was that, on the one hand, due to the progress of domestic films, and on the other hand, due to language barriers between Chinese and foreign languages, business was not as good as in the silent film era. Even first-class cinemas like Nanjing screened domestic films such as "Tears and Laughter Marriage" to attract audiences. In November 193X, foreign film companies united with cinemas such as Grand Guangming, Nanjing, Cathay, Carlton, Summer Peck, and Willie to organize the China Foreign Film Merchants Association, with R. B. Butter as chairman, to find ways to promote business. However, due to the economic downturn and industrial and commercial decline, by 193X, their turnover had decreased by 25% compared to previous years. At the same time, the Chinese government also worked hard to promote domestic films, issuing incentive measures, reducing taxes as much as possible, and increasing foreign film import taxes and inspection fees to show restrictions. Since then, the market for domestic films in Shanghai has slightly increased. However, currently, only Jincheng cinema screens first-class domestic films in Shanghai. The power of foreign films still plays a decisive role.</p>
<p>The market for domestic films is not limited to Shanghai. For example, during the era of martial arts films, they were popular in various Nanyang ports. Some companies even specialized in selling to the five Nanyang territories (British Nanyang, Dutch Nanyang, the Philippines, Siam, and Annam). Recently, the number of cinemas in the mainland has increased, and the market for domestic films has expanded significantly. However, since the crackdown on supernatural martial arts films, the productions in recent years have not been as popular as before with overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Moreover, the Nanyang market is also declining. Therefore, the main business of domestic films is still in Shanghai. However, on the one hand, cinemas screening domestic films in Shanghai still feel that the supply is insufficient. On the other hand, film producers still believe that after a film is screened in Shanghai, there are too few places outside Shanghai where it can be screened, so they still need to lose money. Therefore, they dare not produce too many films. This is indeed a bottleneck in the film business. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the report in your newspaper on August 16 concerning the sinking of the Huadong No. 1 fishing boat, we have found it to be inconsistent with the facts. We are writing to clarify the situation and request a correction. The Huadong No. 1 fishing boat docked at our factory's wharf on the 7th but had not yet entered the dry dock for repairs. The accident last night was due to the negligence of the captain, who failed to anticipate the effects of the tide, causing the boat to tilt and take on water. Our factory is not responsible for any accidents that occur to boats we are repairing before they enter the dry dock. However, due to our friendly relationship with the fishing company, we have arranged for workers to pump out the accumulated water, and the boat has been restored to its original condition. We are writing to request that you publish this correction in your newspaper.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gongmao Machinery Shipbuilding Factory</p>
<p>August 16</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>We were shocked to read the news in your newspaper about the Huadong fishing boat sinking in front of the Gongmao factory in Pudong. Our fishing boat, Huadong No. 1, was undergoing annual repairs at the Gongmao shipyard after the fishing season ended. Yesterday, the factory needed to use the dry dock for a larger vessel. Therefore, it moved our fishing boat southward. Unexpectedly, the river bottom there was deep on the outside and shallow on the inside, causing the boat to tilt. The hold was flooded with the tide. This morning, the tide receded, and the water was pumped out. The boat is now unharmed. We are concerned that this misinformation may spread. We hereby request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Huadong Fisheries Company</p>

<h3 id="e129">Grand Event Ends on the 16th The World Games Held Closing Ceremony Yesterday The Five-Ring Flag Lowered Amidst Music and Gunfire The Marathon Tower's Torch Also Extinguished 6,000 Young People from Around the World Depart Separately <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency Special Correspondent, Berlin, 16th - The Eleventh Olympic Games, which began in Berlin on August 1st, proceeded exceptionally smoothly. All events were completed by today. The closing ceremony is scheduled for 5:00 PM today.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Berlin, 16th - The Eleventh International Olympic Games, which gathered 6,000 young warriors from around the world to perform fervent competitions, after opening on August 1st, reached its peak and ended with a solemn closing ceremony at 7:00 PM on the 16th at the Grunewald Stadium. At 7:20 PM, the Marathon Tower trumpets sounded, shaking the distant reaches. Flag bearers from each country carried their national flags and entered the stadium in single file to the accompaniment of marches, lined up in a horizontal row facing the VIP grandstand. International Olympic Committee Chairman Count Latour rose and delivered the closing speech. Next, "The Flame Song" was played. At 7:33 PM, the order to lower the flag was given. The music was melodious, celebratory guns fired in succession, and the five-ring Olympic flag gradually descended. The torch burning on the Marathon Tower also disappeared at some unknown time, causing people to feel a sense of parting. The removed Olympic flag was handed over by the acting mayor of Los Angeles, Mr. Gammonde, to the mayor of Berlin, Mr. Liebel. The three flagpoles bearing the names of Germany 1936, Greece 1896, and Japan 1940 were then arranged with the Greek flag in the center, the German flag on the left, and the Japanese flag on the right, clearly indicating that the next Games would be held in Tokyo. Finally, Team Leader Hiranuma, representing the Japanese Olympic Committee, took the stage to explain the Tokyo Olympic Games and invited all to come early. The applause throughout the stadium was thunderous. Afterwards, the German orchestra sang the Olympic Anthem. After the song ended, the bells rang in succession for five minutes. From this point, the athletes of each country gradually withdrew from the venue. The current Games were declared a complete success, and the event was adjourned at 8:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Detailed Account of the Italy-Austria Football Final More Than 160,000 Spectators The Austrian Goalkeeper's Performance Was Outstanding <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>(Central News Agency Special Correspondent, Berlin Radio, 16th) - Yesterday's Italy-Austria football final, held in the main stadium, was the liveliest event since the opening. There were 160,000 spectators. In addition, there were thousands more who could not purchase tickets and stood outside the stadium, listening to the radio broadcast. Its popularity is evident. The stadium's grass was as green as a carpet, and the field was flat and boundless, extremely suitable for running. More than a hundred children were hired around the field to pick up balls, in order to avoid delaying time. The spectators from both countries organized cheering squads, chanting and cheering, and the situation was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Italy's Victory Certainly Not Accidental</p>
<p>During the match, there was not a minute that was not extremely tense. The performance of both teams was superb. The forwards' attacks and the defenders' blocks were both unique. After 45 minutes of fierce battle, neither side had scored. In the second half, each side scored one goal. In the 30-minute overtime, Italy scored two goals and won. Italy's victory was due to its special strengths and was certainly not accidental. The defense was as solid as a steel wall, and the forwards' attacks were incredibly fast. Especially the left wing's performance was the most outstanding, sharp and extraordinary. Passing and shooting were effortless. The entire team worked together seamlessly.</p>
<p>Austrian Goalkeeper Unmatched Worldwide</p>
<p>Austria was also a strong team and performed very well. Otherwise, the game would not have gone to overtime and they would not have lost by just one goal. The Austrian goalkeeper's skills were praised throughout the stadium. High balls, bouncing balls, whether jumping or lying down, he could save them all. His courage was even more admirable. The two goals conceded were both unavoidable. Spectators said that if a world football team was organized to compete against other planets, forwards and midfielders could be chosen from various countries, which would not be easy, but the Austrian goalkeeper would definitely be selected without any doubt.</p>
<p>Neither Side Scored in the First Half</p>
<p>During the match, both sides were eager to win, and their actions were inevitably excessive, which was regrettable. After the start of the match, Austria took the offensive first, but failed to succeed. Italy then counterattacked. A winger drove along the side. The Austrian midfield and defenders responded and blocked. The ball hovered near the goal. The situation was extremely dangerous. Before long, the Austrian team also showed its power in front of the Italian goal. Fortunately, the shot was inaccurate, avoiding danger. The tense and fierce situation was breathtaking. After 45 minutes of fierce battle, neither side had scored.</p>
<p>Italy Opens the Scoring Team Members Celebrate</p>
<p>After switching sides, both teams were eager to win the championship, and the match became even more exciting. After 24 minutes, the Italian left wing lightly attacked, dribbling the ball to the opponent's goal and kicking it. The Austrian goalkeeper dived and slapped the ball out. The Italian left wing caught up and kicked again. The ball went into the net, opening the scoring. The Italian players shook hands and kissed the left wing. The audience cheered like thunder. After that, the Italian team's momentum was very strong. Austria tried its best to counterattack. Nine minutes before the end, they finally had an opportunity. The left inside forward dribbled the ball and broke through several defenses. Near the opponent's back line, about ten yards from the goal, he lifted his foot and shot. The ball flew straight into the upper left corner of the goal. The Italian goalkeeper thought the ball had gone out of bounds. He was stunned and did not know what to do. The score became 1-1, a tie.</p>
<p>Overtime Ends in Final Victory</p>
<p>The overtime was 30 minutes. In order to take the initiative, Austria launched a major offensive, but still failed. The Italian right wing launched another attack, going straight along the side. When they reached the baseline, they passed the ball to the left wing. After getting the ball, the left wing dribbled up to about five yards from the goal and shot, scoring a goal. Cheers rose again. Austria, losing this goal, had no choice but to try to counterattack. Except for the goalkeeper, all the players crossed the midfield line, trying to recover lost ground. Italy also deployed troops to defend closely. In the last five minutes, Austria shot at the Italian goal three times in a row from about twenty yards away. But all three shots were blocked. This was probably due to carelessness.</p>
<h3 id="e131">British Lord Aberdare Praises the Current World Games <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, Berlin, August 15th - Lord Aberdare, a member of the International Olympic Committee, told reporters today, "The future success of the Olympic Games seems to be improving day by day. This time in Berlin has been another unparalleled success."</p>
<p>The British sportsman said of the friendship and hospitality of the people of Berlin during the World Games, "I feel that all the people of Berlin participated in this world youth conference with sincerity and friendship."</p>
<p>Regarding British-German relations, Lord Aberdare said that the friendly relations between Britain and Germany are historically very close. Moreover, the two nations have a close relationship in blood. Finally, Lord Aberdare said, "The impression I gained during my short stay in Germany is that all the German people are of one heart and one mind and are striving together under the great leadership. When I visited Chancellor Hitler, I felt that he was one of the most influential people in the German nation. After various conversations, I deeply believe that Germany is sincerely seeking cooperation with Britain to jointly maintain world peace. All European countries should be grateful to Germany, because the German National Socialist Party government opposes communism and clears its influence."</p>

<p>(39) The Olympic Village</p>
<p>The Olympic Village is built near Topsille, 40 kilometers outside Berlin. Although the village's houses were only recently completed, Germany has been planning and building this village for more than ten years. Therefore, the 140-plus acres of land are covered with lush green grass and tall trees, almost like a garden. It is said that after the closing of the World Games, this village will be converted into a barracks. Germans are always so well-planned in whatever they do.</p>
<p>In front of the village, a two-story building in the shape of the Chinese character "人" (person) was built, called the International Building. It can be said to be the headquarters of the village. In addition to the offices, each participating country has an office. There are also post offices, telegraph offices, banks, and shops, with very complete facilities. Therefore, although the village is far from Berlin, the athletes can buy everything they need here without any shortcomings.</p>
<p>The highest administrative officer in the village is the governor, who is supported by many senior officers, soldiers, and youth service corps members. The security and order of the village are maintained by senior officers leading the soldiers, and all services are provided by members of the youth service corps. The members of the youth service corps are all university or high school students who have received special training in advance. They all wear white uniforms and are assigned to the dormitories of various countries according to the foreign languages they speak, representing a neat and generous attitude, and being kind and sincere. The members of the corps serving in the Chinese athletes' dormitory are commanded by officer Kuef Y. Mr. Kuef once served as a consultant in our country and speaks fluent Mandarin. He gets along very well with the athletes.</p>
<p>There is a typing room in the village building, where more than a dozen young women are engaged in typing work. They are always happy to help with any brief requests. Apart from these women, no other women can be found in the village.</p>
<p>There are a total of 178 new houses in the village. Each house and each road is named after a German place name. Each house is hung with a map of the local area, making it easy for athletes from various countries to recognize. The German propaganda method can be called very clever.</p>
<p>The largest building in the village is called the Berlin Building. It is four stories high and also has a basement. It is the dining hall where athletes from various countries gather for meals. There are more than 40 rooms in this building, each with a kitchen in the back. The ingredients used in the kitchen are stored in the basement. When needed, they can be notified by telephone. Each country's dining room has its own national flag. The athletes from Japan, the United States, and Italy are the most numerous, so the dining rooms are also the largest. The Chinese athletes' dining room is next to Bulgaria. Each meal has a different menu and is cooked according to the tastes of each country. The Chinese athletes can eat white rice, one soup, and two dishes for each meal. The taste is very delicious. As for eggs, milk, coffee, and vegetables, they can be enjoyed to the fullest. No one is not satisfied.</p>
<p>The dormitories are all bungalows, with eleven rooms in each building and two people in each room. Not only are they equipped with telephones and bathrooms, but even towels, quilts, toothbrushes, and toothpaste are fully supplied. It can be said to be very thoughtful. Our Chinese athletes occupy buildings 70, 72, 90, and 92, but number 72 is shared with Mexican athletes. Female athletes live separately in the female dormitory, which is far from the village. Male martial arts athletes live in the barracks. In addition, representatives from track and field, basketball, boxing, weightlifting, race walking, and cycling teams all live in the village.</p>
<p>There are two hospitals in the village, one is a general hospital and the other is a specialized hospital. The doctors used are all very famous figures in Germany. The equipment in the hospital is complete and the instruments are new. Many large hospitals in China cannot compare with it. The X-ray in the specialized hospital can clearly show the movement of the heart and stomach. Athletes from various countries take this opportunity to check their bodies. The doctors are overwhelmed with work.</p>
<p>The sports field in the village is not only very large but also has new facilities. The runway is paved with yellow sand, which is hard and moderate, far better than a cinder track. The jumping pit is filled with white sand. The hurdles and high jump frames are also made with the latest methods. Every morning at 5:30, athletes from various countries start practicing. The long-distance running experts from Finland and the short black people from the United States are the most noticeable. There are seven or eight fighting and boxing fields. There are friendly matches every morning and afternoon, attracting many spectators.</p>
<p>From 9 p.m. to 10 p.m., entertainment programs are held in the Hindenburg Building, including songs, dances, movies, and various performances, all of which are wonderful and dazzling. Athletes from various countries can participate freely, like an international gathering. There are more than 300 athletes from the United States. Their costumes are strange, their attitudes are lively and innocent, and they are the most eye-catching in the entire venue. In short, the athletes live in a beautiful environment in the village, leading a regular and interesting life every day. Their spirits and bodies are very happy. After the opening of the Games, they should create more excellent records.</p>

<p>Reuters, Bochum, Germany, 15th - The international friendly track and field competition was held here today. Famous American black athlete Owens (who recently won three championships in the long jump, 100-meter, and 200-meter races at the Berlin Olympics) also participated.

(Note: Owens's record at the Olympics was 8.06 meters.) Owens later surpassed Lerin in the 100-meter race with a time of 10.3 seconds, equaling the world record.</p>

<p>The first Mayor's Cup Open Men's Singles Tennis Championship, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Sports Field, decided the quarter-finalists in four groups yesterday morning at 9:00 AM. Wang Xiangdong, Tang Baojia, Xu Zengrui, and Luo Minmeng qualified for the quarter-finals. These four will hold the semi-finals tomorrow at 5:30 PM, using a best-of-five-sets system. (No matches today.) The details of yesterday's matches and tomorrow's schedule are listed below.</p>
<p>Wang Xudong Wins Against Xu Demin</p>
<p>Wang Xiangdong and Xu Demin were evenly matched. Xu took the lead in one game, but Wang immediately tied the score and led 2-1. However, Wang Xu soon exceeded 5-2. Then he scored another game. Wang won the first game with 6-3. The second game was more competitive and exciting. You come and I go, each refusing to give in. However, Xu's eagerness to win was too strong, and there were many early mistakes, causing him to be beaten by Wang with 6-4 consecutive wins.</p>
<p>Tang Baojia Wins Against Wang Shuqing</p>
<p>Tang Baojia immediately used sharp serves and fierce smashes upon contact, winning five consecutive games in one go. Wang Shuqing was careful and cautious, pulling back two games. Tang again continued to kill and smash, and won the first game with 6-2. In the deciding set, he continued to work hard and lead with 5-2. Seeing the situation was not good, Wang cheered up and used long shots and short lobs to chase the score to 5-4. At this point, Tang used an accurate diagonal long shot, making Wang run around for his life, and Tang then won with 6-4.</p>
<p>Xu Zengrui Wins Against Hu Zhongguang</p>
<p>Xu and Hu's ball skills are obviously superior. Xu's victory is natural. After Xu took the lead, he immediately used extremely fierce smashes to win two consecutive games. Hu pulled back one game in extreme struggle, but in an instant, Xu ended the first set with 6-1. At the start of the second set, Hu was too young and lacked energy. The balls he hit lacked control. After 3-0, he began to use serving opportunities to pull back a game. In the end, he lost with 6-1.</p>
<p>Luo Minmeng Wins Against Zhang Lunquan</p>
<p>Left-handed general Luo Minmeng fiercely attacked Zhang Lunquan with a sweeping style yesterday, so it was not difficult to win the first set. In the deciding set, Zhang calmly fought back, once leading with 4-3. From the eighth game, the competition between the two sides was fierce, and there were as many as twelve ties. In the end, Luo Minmeng won with 6-4 due to his skillful ball skills.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Schedule</p>
<p>Wang Xiangdong vs. Tang Baojia at 5:30 PM</p>
<p>Xu Zengrui vs. Luo Minmeng at 5:30 PM</p>
<h3 id="e141">Reform and Construction of China's Sports Policy - Wu Tiecheng <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Broadcast speech on the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Sports College</p>
<p>The most basic condition for the development of a country and the rejuvenation of a nation is to improve the function of national cells and develop the superior qualities of the people's intelligence, morality, and physique. The ancient Western philosopher Plato discussed the establishment of an ideal country, requiring its citizens to have four virtues: justice, temperance, wisdom, and courage. Justice is the basis of all virtues, temperance can prevent the indulgence of desires, wisdom can govern the country, and courage can defend the country. The principles of teaching the people by the ancient Chinese sages also did not go beyond these three points:</p>
<p>First, intelligence;</p>
<p>Second, benevolence;</p>
<p>Third, courage. Therefore, it is said, "Intelligence, benevolence, and courage are the universal virtues of the world." These three virtues, from the individual's point of view, are the essential elements for completing one's personality; from the country's point of view, they are even more the essential elements for building and strengthening the country. Therefore, cultivating and developing the superior qualities of intelligence, morality, and physique, or intelligence, benevolence, and courage, is indeed the primary task of teaching the people and building the country. In the process of rejuvenating the nation, those who bear the heavy responsibility of teaching the people and building the country should not neglect or ignore the cultivation of these superior qualities of the people's intelligence, morality, and physique. At the same time, we, as the national cells of the country, if we want to shoulder the great mission of saving the country, preserving its existence, and rejuvenating the nation, should be intelligent and virtuous, and cultivate both literary and military skills, so as to balance the development of the three qualities of intelligence, morality, and physique, and fully promote the universal virtues of intelligence, benevolence, and courage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Confucian scholars of the past misunderstood the true meaning of the holy way, misinterpreted the scope of education, only engaged in recitation, did not attend to practical matters, talked emptily about human nature and reason, did not value practice, loved ease and hated labor, and advocated rejection of advancement, thereby creating a kind of nihilistic and decadent academic style. As a result, the people's will became depressed and the nation declined day by day. The reason for poverty and weakness is indeed a serious step. Since the rise of new studies, Western sports methods have been transplanted to China, and the academic style in various parts of the country has also changed. However, due to errors in sports policy, neither a sound system nor a perfect organization and appropriate training have been established. Some people devoted to sports are also inevitably obsessed with fame and fortune, and immersed in vanity. They usually do not focus on their studies, and when the time comes, they each hold their own opinions, and even make noise and exaggerate, regarding sports as the patent of a few special people, destroying the proper and great significance and function of sports, and having no benefit to the health of the general people, the increase of the productive forces of the entire society, and the self-defense of the country.</p>
<p>Although China has athletes participating in the World Games held in Berlin this time, the results of competing with athletes from various countries in track and field, swimming, soccer, and basketball cannot compete with others. Our purpose in participating in the World Games is not to compete with others for a day's worth of short-term gains. Although we should not be disappointed or discouraged by the result of this disastrous defeat, we must learn from the past and use the stones of other mountains to polish our own jade. What we have observed and felt about the sports policies, sports systems, sports organizations, sports methods, sports training, and sports spirit of various countries cannot but be selectively followed as a reference. We must also deeply reflect on and seek to improve our own shortcomings - no policy, no organization, no method, no training, no effort, no sincerity, no hard work, no cooperation.</p>
<p>Since the European War, the world's sports policies have undergone new changes due to the pressure of the times and the needs of the environment. The wise authorities of various countries have a new understanding of the significance of sports. For example, Italy regards sports as an urgent task for training youth and revitalizing the nation. The Soviet Union regards sports competitions as a "national defense and production examination." Therefore, sports today is no longer the patent of athletes or a recreational pastime. Its scope has become increasingly popular, and it has almost integrated with the entire people. Its purpose is to focus on production and national defense. In addition to strengthening the people's physical and mental health and training ordinary skills, it also provides various training related to increasing production capacity and combat techniques, with the aim of enabling the entire people to have the ability and spirit of long-term labor and national resistance.</p>
<p>China is deeply weak, the people's physique is so frail, the people's spirit is so depressed, the production capacity is so backward, and the foundation of national defense is so weak. Therefore, China's sports policy today must be thoroughly reformed. China's sports experts today should eliminate personal vanity, eliminate the accumulated habits of exaggeration, and not think that they have exhausted the skills of sports by running, jumping, playing, and losing their ambitions. They should deeply understand the trend of modern sports development and its great significance, work hard, practice diligently, and strive upwards, "suffering their minds, laboring their muscles and bones," so as to be able to shoulder the arduous mission of rejuvenating the nation, so that our poor and weak motherland and the precarious national fortune may have the hope of becoming rich and strong and turning around.</p>
<p>In view of this, our city intends to use the existing large sports field to establish a sports college with a relatively complete scale as a test for reforming China's sports policy, based on the principles of national defense, militarization, production, and popularization of sports, and according to the needs of the national reality, to cultivate new and healthy sports teachers to be the guides for training young people across the country. In addition to strengthening the physical fitness of the general public, we can also inspire the spirit of the people and transform the decadent and habitual inferiority of the people, so that the people of the whole country can develop a spirit of perseverance, loyalty, courage, and striving under a sound sports policy, so as to generally improve the productivity of society and enrich the nation's self-defense capabilities, not only to win medals when competing with athletes from various countries, but also to be brave warriors to defend the survival of the country in the critical juncture of national struggle, in order to win and permanently preserve the glory of our nation.

<p>The Shanghai Advanced Baseball League held its third match yesterday. China fought McLain B. McLain B team's strength is even greater than the A team. The day before yesterday, they also won against the defending champion amateur team with 6-4. Yesterday, taking advantage of the victory, they defeated our China team again with 17-6. After the game, China attacked first. Gan Guanyou got a double and immediately returned to base, scoring one point. McLain also scored one point by Brant, resulting in an even score. In the second, third, and fourth innings, McLain's score soared. Brant even got a home run in the fourth inning. Our team did not score any points except for one hit. In the fifth inning, our team scored one point by Lei Ying. McLain's Brant and Shi Hai each scored a home run. Che Xun got a double. As many as six people successively returned to base. In the sixth inning, Gu Degang was killed on the spot. Gu Tingchang and Gan Zhen were double-killed by Bennett, transferred to Locke, and immediately out. McLain's Vance萊 was also killed as he came to the stage. After Crowe safely boarded the base, Brant hit, and was also caught by our Zeng Ruiqi.傅 Gu Tingchang retaliated with a double kill in the same way, which was the most exciting game of yesterday. In the seventh inning, Zeng Ruiqi got a triple, and Gan Guanyou got a double, scoring a total of three points. However, McLain's Miles, Bennett, and Johnson also returned to base and scored three points each. In the eighth inning, after China's Gu Tingchang returned to base, Gan Zhen got a hit, and then advanced to second base due to the opponent's mistake, but unfortunately, when Zeng Ruikang attacked, he was double-killed by Miles passing to Johnson and then passing to Vance. In the ninth inning, although our team's Zeng Ruiqi got a 壘打, he did not score any points and was immediately out. As a result, McLain B won 17 to 6. Although the China team still suffered a defeat yesterday, the battle record was excellent, but there were still many mistakes and the running speed was slow. This was caused by the lack of practice at ordinary times. As for the missed catches of high balls, it was also one of the reasons for the failure. In another game yesterday, McLain A defeated the amateur team again with 9-4. The third match will be played again this weekend. The scores are as follows: Each inning's score</p>

<h3 id="e147">Twenty-Three Cultural Organizations Bid Farewell to Students Going Abroad Yesterday; Mayor Wu Presided and Delivered a Farewell Speech; Speeches Also Given by Mu Ouchu, Wang Xiaolai, and Others; Second Group of Students Going to America Scheduled to Set Sail Tomorrow <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education and twenty-three organizations including the World Student Association jointly held a farewell ceremony for this year's students going abroad at the municipal government auditorium at 4 p.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu presided over the ceremony and delivered a farewell speech. Wang Xiaolai, Mu Ouchu, and others gave speeches. Student representatives Ms. Shen Yao and Wang Xiangyao and Xu Zongyi gave replies. The atmosphere was very enthusiastic. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>
<p>Included Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Garrison Commander Yang Xiaotian, Shen Yi of the Public Works Bureau, Cai Jingjun of the Public Security Bureau, Jiang Jianbai representing the Municipal Bureau of Education, Zhu Shaoping and Wu Deyin of the World Student Association, Hu Duanxing of Jiaotong University, Du Zuozhou of Jinan University, Qin Mian'an of Guanghua University, Liu Zhanen of Hujiang University, Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mu Ouchu and Du Yuesheng of the Local Association, Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Shi Yangnan of the Vocational Education Society, Xu Xinliu of the International Four-Question Research Association, He Zhenya and Wu Zijing of the German-Austrian Alumni Association, Ma Chonggan of Shen Bao, Zai Boqi and Hu Shuyi of Xinwen Bao, Zhu Yixin of Min Bao, Huang Zheheng of Zhonghua Ribao, Chen Dongbai of Jiaoyu Ribao, Zhu Zhiming of Shanghai Xinwenshe, Dong Xianguang of Dalu Bao, Zhu Shaoping of Zhongguo Pinglun Bao, Huang Jingwan of Shangwu, Cheng Shisheng of Zhonghua, Zhao Luqing of Shijie Shuju, and over five hundred students going abroad.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>After the music played and everyone took their seats, Mayor Wu delivered a farewell speech, saying briefly: "Today, various cultural organizations in Shanghai are jointly bidding farewell to this year's students going abroad. I am very honored to be the chairman. Shanghai is the hub of communication between China and foreign countries. Every year, students from all over the country going abroad mostly leave from Shanghai, so the people of Shanghai all feel honored. In the past decade, especially in the last four or five years, China has faced the most difficult times in its history. In this time of serious national crisis and economic distress, the number of students going abroad is increasing year by year, with self-funded students accounting for three-quarters of the total. From this, we can see that the Chinese people are aware that building the country and making it prosperous and strong does not depend on fate, but requires intelligence, knowledge, and ability. Therefore, although the people of the whole country are suffering greatly, even when many don't have enough to eat, they are able to take out money to send their children abroad to study. This is undoubtedly a ray of dawn for China's future. From this ray of dawn, we can predict that China's future holds boundless hope. This is the first point. Secondly, in the past, most students studying abroad were studying liberal arts. This year, the total number of students studying abroad is more than 300, and three-quarters of them are studying science and engineering, with liberal arts accounting for only one-quarter. This point can also prove that students studying abroad are able to recognize the current needs of the country. This is the second point. From the above points, we feel that the future of the country is hopeful, and that hope lies in today's youth, who will bear the responsibility for the country's future. If today's youth can wholeheartedly study abroad for the sake of our country and our people, then we should celebrate for the country. In addition, when you go abroad to study, you should not only seek knowledge from books, but also carefully study the ways in which European and American countries have become prosperous and strong. Today's cultural organizations are bidding farewell, and I represent everyone's wishes in offering my best wishes for your success."</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests</p>
<p>Zhang Fayao then gave a speech reporting on the living conditions in European and American countries. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, in which, in addition to encouraging the students going abroad to work hard in their studies, he also hoped that the World Student Association would report on the situation of the students after they returned to China. After Wang's speech, Mu Ouchu, a veteran of our country's students studying abroad and representative of the Local Association, and Dr. Liu Zhanen, president of Hujiang University, gave speeches in succession. The details are omitted.</p>
<p>Student Replies</p>
<p>After the guests' speeches, student representative Ms. Shen Yao gave a reply, saying briefly: "Today, we are very grateful to the cultural organizations in Shanghai for bidding us farewell, and to the mayor and all the guests for their thorough instructions. We have our own small goals in going abroad to study. These goals are nothing more than seeking knowledge. What we seek is the new knowledge and new culture of European and American countries. What we are learning is the current situation of social services for women in Europe and America. We will apply the new knowledge and new culture to our new life in our country. We will never dare to fail your enthusiastic hopes," and so on. Wang Xiangyao and Xu Zongyi then gave replies in succession, which were largely the same, so I will not repeat them. Finally, there was a photo session, refreshments, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Setting Sail Tomorrow</p>
<p>The third group of students going to the United States, including Li Shaochang, Zhong Wei, and Shen Tong, a group of more than thirty people, are scheduled to set sail tomorrow on the President Grant. The fourth group, including Shen Yao, Fang Shangui, and Gu Dechang, a group of more than fifty people, will set sail on the Empress of Japan on the 25th of this month. The last group will leave the country on the President Coolidge on September 8.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Silk and Wheat <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— (Xinan)</p>
<p>"Silkworms and ripe wheat" were originally the most hopeful season for farmers, but since the continuous low prices of silkworms and wheat, farmers not only find it difficult to benefit, but in fact, they still have to suffer losses. Some people think that farmers will never do things that lose money. This is really not knowing the hardship of farming. You need to know that farmers' work is not counted as labor value. Today they plow, tomorrow they fertilize, sweat and water, they have to do it whether it's sunny or rainy. If we calculate the same way as the people in institutions, companies, stores, factories, and all those who calculate value according to labor, then the cost of one liter of wheat or one kilogram of silk, sold at market price, would probably lose 100%. Fortunately, farmers are generous and not as petty as capitalists, so no matter how low the market price is, they are always willing to sell it, and they don't complain. Next year, they will still breed as usual. In fact, farmers are not that stupid. Since they cannot avoid the exploitation of the industrial and commercial sectors, and without this, they would not even have rags and coarse food to eat, it's better to suffer a little! And in a blink of an eye, hearing the news, prices suddenly rise again. They can only blame themselves for selling too early, their fate is bad, and they can't sell at a good price, but they don't know the mystery behind it. Although this is not a definite method, the manipulation techniques have become more sophisticated over the years, and no one supervises them not to manipulate. Such situations often occur. The following will discuss silk and wheat separately.</p>
<p>1. Silk</p>
<p>Since the trend of unified control came to China, everyone talks about unified control, and silkworm cocoons cannot be an exception. Unified control is not a bad thing, but you must not think that once you talk about unified control, everything must be managed by me. Even if it should be managed, the managers must have practical experience. Don't look at anything else, just look at the foremen of the factories. If you use people who don't know what they are managing, the factory will be ruined. What's more, silkworm farming is scattered everywhere, which is more difficult to manage than a factory. You can't do it rashly. Therefore, the most important thing now is how to gradually organize them and improve the illegal aspects of their traditional breeding methods in order to increase their production and obtain favorable prices, thereby increasing their interest in silkworm farming. Considerable efforts have been made in the production of seeds, but it is only importing foreign silkworm seeds to replace local seeds. Regarding breeding methods, either the demands are too high, making farmers hesitant to approach, or they are just superficial imitations that are not suitable for farmers' actual use. China has more than 4,000 years of silkworm farming history, so it must have its advantages. Otherwise, silkworm seeds would not have spread to this day and become popular abroad. However, there are many places in the old breeding methods where they know how to do it but don't know why. Now, we should study the gains and losses of silkworm farming habits in various places and supplement their deficiencies. This is the right thing to do. It is a fact that farmers have limited knowledge, but they often use reasoning methods to breed silkworms. Someone told me that a farmer, seeing that his silkworms were about to stiffen, thought that this was like a person having a cold (what a cold is is another question). Since cold medicine is used to treat colds, why can't it be used for silkworm colds? So he mixed cold medicine water with water and sprayed it on the leaves, and the silkworms ate it and were saved. This method should not be taken as an example, and don't misunderstand that cold medicine water can cure stiff silkworms and use it for advertising. What caused them not to stiffen, and whether there are other reasons, should be discussed separately. The author mentions this because he sees that many of China's silkworm farming methods come from experience, and there must be many good methods, but they are not used properly, or should be reorganized using scientific methods. Then, guide them according to the situation and correct and improve them. Don't just bring out foreign brands. If you are really an expert, you will be able to combine the old and the new, and naturally produce a new culture or new group that adapts to the current needs, not a lifeless imitation of written knowledge.</p>
<p>In the past, silk merchants suffered a lot due to the falling price of silk. But now it is different. Since the price of cocoons is limited and farmers cannot sell at good prices, the price of silk has been rising year after year without being affected in the slightest. Therefore, in recent years, some silk merchants have failed and some have succeeded. But taking the interests of the majority as the interests, it is important to protect the interests of silk merchants, but the interests of farmers are also important. If we only talk about the interests of a few silk merchants and investors, and set a price to buy fresh cocoons, it's like "wanting to eat mutton but not wanting to kill sheep." This should be considered.</p>
<p>Since silk merchants have gained an advantage, banks have already recovered the spring cocoon loans in full. There is no need to handle autumn cocoon loans anymore, and you can imagine their complacent state. I remember during the European War, flour mills, yarn mills, and iron factories made a lot of unexpected wealth, but they used it to distribute dividends and use what came easily. What about now? The current silk industry can't even compare to one ten-thousandth of the yarn mills back then. It's just a little bit of profit, and it still comes from the price of cocoons. If their operations have surplus profits, I hope they will use it to improve mechanical equipment and develop foreign trade, rather than just focusing on distributing dividends and never planning for future business development like the factories did before. If they can do this, then although farmers have suffered losses in cocoon prices, it is still not a complete loss.</p>
<p>It is said that the inspection of raw silk exports has been implemented, and grading will have to wait until next year. However, from this, it can be seen that the silk industry has not yet made a sincere effort to reform itself. Speaking of raw silk inspection, as early as the 34th year of Guangxu, someone suggested establishing a raw silk inspection office in Shanghai. The Qing court only ordered the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to invite a number of silk merchants to report to the Ministry for selection and approval. Since the founding of the Republic of China, there have been countless theories on improving raw silk, but for forty years, the situation has remained the same. Foreigners are making progress year after year and month after month, but in our country, no matter who they are, they only talk the talk. All theories are used as tools for personal gain and as a means of embellishing their image. They fail to do it in a practical way. The decline and fall are due to this. Now the silk industry is on the verge of collapse. If it is still like a swallow building its nest on a dangerous curtain, unable to pull itself together and strive for revitalization, and wants to sell silk of different grades at the same price, who would be willing to patronize it?</p>
<p>2. Wheat</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the issue of wheat exports, the grain industry and the flour industry have different positions and different views. It is reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has convened a meeting to decide on the matter. Whether this is true remains to be proven by future facts.</p>
<p>However, it should be noted that the grain industry's claim that "wheat will rot and decay year after year" is somewhat exaggerated. And the basis of the argument is originally an estimate. According to the current situation in China, not to mention the whole country, even the production of a single place, being able to have a relatively reliable estimate, is not easy. How dare they say that the production of a certain item in a certain year is several thousand, several hundred, several tens of thousands, and that the loss is several tens of thousands, and that the planting area is several acres. I don't know what kind of survey method was used and where the estimate came from. Such actions, although it is not convenient to say that they are reckless, are also too bold. The production of industrial products is concentrated in factories, and there are records to rely on, but it is still not possible to obtain relatively reliable statistics. What about scattered and complicated agricultural products? Furthermore, such as customs import and export statistics, everyone thinks they are reliable, but they don't know how much smuggling goes in and out every year, which is not listed in the customs records. Therefore, the field of statistics is really difficult to talk about. Therefore, when compiling statistics, we should strive to be careful and ensure that the degree of credibility is one point more and better, and that the doubtful component is one point less. It is not possible to amaze people by exaggerating numbers. If the basis of statistics is unreliable, it will only confuse people. This is not the original intention of compiling statistics. Therefore, the grain industry's excuse of surplus and the flour industry's excuse of people's food are both smokescreens for business and are used for selfish purposes.</p>
<p>Therefore, regardless of whether wheat is surplus or insufficient, it cannot be solved by prohibiting exports. However, the time for new wheat to be harvested is not far away. Although farmers have sold some, they still have some in stock. Therefore, the price of goods will rise with the new harvest, which is beneficial to farmers. Moreover, wheat prices had already risen before the Japanese started buying, which shows that the high price of wheat is not entirely due to exports, but at most one of the reasons. The grain industry must have also hoarded a lot after seeing Japanese merchants buying, and they are afraid of the flour industry's plan to sell, so they use the excuse of abundance to argue that exports should not be prohibited, so that they can still sell at good prices. The flour industry, because the result of various parties buying up wheat at the time of new wheat production, cannot obtain cheap raw materials like in previous years, so they must find a way to make wheat prices return to normal. All these scheming maneuvers are not for the sake of people's food, nor for the sake of farmers. Therefore, if what both sides claim is true, then how to make grain cheap without hurting farmers, grain expensive without hurting the people, and how to make appropriate adjustments so that all industries have the hope of development, let's see what measures will be taken in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Import of Foreign Wheat Amidst Reports of Bumper Wheat Harvests <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Jing Shi</p>
<p>Recent reports indicate that domestic wheat production has seen bumper harvests across various regions, with prices also being low. Consequently, Japanese merchants have been actively procuring wheat from the interior, already amounting to over 13,000 tons. This has caused considerable panic among mechanized flour mills, leading to a petition to the Ministry of Industry to prohibit wheat exports. Simultaneously, at this time when new wheat is entering the market, flour mills have turned to purchasing three shiploads of foreign wheat, amounting to 200,000 bags, arriving in Shanghai. While it is said that these were early orders, such a contradictory phenomenon leaves outsiders puzzled. However, based on past events, it is not surprising. We recall that in 1934, the entire country was affected by widespread drought, resulting in a significant reduction in food crop harvests. Yet, in that year, imports of foreign rice were only 7,711,000 dan, foreign wheat 4,649,000 dan, and flour 596,000 dan. In 1933, rainfall was evenly distributed across the country, leading to bountiful harvests everywhere, which in turn resulted in low grain prices that harmed farmers. The imports of foreign rice reached a staggering 12,787,000 dan, foreign wheat 10,576,000 dan, and flour 1,933,000 dan. Considering this, it is questionable whether the continuous influx of foreign grain into our country is clear evidence of domestic food shortages. However, the abnormal import of foreign grain is undoubtedly related to the scale of domestic food crop harvests and imbalances in supply and demand. Therefore, the current bumper wheat harvest and the purchase of foreign wheat are simply repeating the contradictions of the past, which is not a new phenomenon. The underlying reasons seem to be as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Actual Shortages and Foreign Wheat Imports</p>
<p>Wheat production in our country is widespread; however, there are no accurate statistics available for reference on the amount produced. According to general estimates, the national output is over tens of millions of piculs. From 1931 to 1935, the average annual output was 446,339,000 piculs. This year, according to agricultural reports, the estimated harvest is over 470 million piculs, the highest predicted amount in recent years. Furthermore, the average annual import over the past five years is 11,588,970 piculs. If we add these two figures and subtract the re-exported 611,128 piculs, the total is 468,316,779 piculs. Wheat consumption is 462,435,000 piculs, which, when offset by the average annual harvest, suggests a shortage of 16,096,000 piculs (Note 1). Therefore, according to customs records, wheat imports in recent years have been 5,129,879 dan in 1932, 10,714,638 dan in 1933, 4,649,419 dan in 1934, 5,209,087 dan in 1935, and 1,117,726 dan in the first half of this year. Some of these figures are close to the calculated figures, while others exceed them. This is because wheat-producing areas in our country are vast, often located in remote areas. Even if there is a surplus, transportation is inconvenient, making it impossible to adjust for those in need. As a result, those in need feel even more deficient and have no choice but to rely on foreign wheat to supplement their needs. This is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>2. Flour Mills' Need for Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>The largest consumer of wheat is the flour milling industry. According to the Yearbook of Flour Milling, there are over 90 flour mills in the country, widely distributed across thirteen provinces. The annual output reaches 75 million bags, with a value of over 200 million yuan. The output of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is the largest, accounting for 60% of the total. Shandong and Henan provinces are next, accounting for 20%, and the remaining provinces account for the other 20%. The production and sales volume for 1934 are shown in the table below (Note 2).</p>
<p>According to the table above, the output in 1934 was 74,930,465 bags, with each bag weighing 49 pounds. Assuming that each picul of wheat can produce over 62 pounds of flour, the annual wheat requirement should be 44,120,745 piculs, making them the largest consumers of wheat. However, the quality of domestically produced wheat is inferior to that of foreign wheat, making it necessary to mix in foreign wheat during flour production. In addition, inconvenient transportation and high freight costs are also reasons for flour mills to use foreign wheat. For example, the freight cost per picul of Canadian wheat shipped to Shanghai is only about 60 cents in national currency, while the freight cost per picul of wheat shipped from the North China region to Shanghai is at least 80 to 90 cents. Furthermore, the cost of shipping one ton of American wheat to Shanghai, including all taxes and freight charges, is only 30 yuan, while the cost of shipping one ton of wheat from central Shaanxi to Shanghai is 130 to 140 yuan. Moreover, the wheat available in the market in our country is purely surplus from farmers' own consumption, which is then sold to the market. As a result, purchasing large quantities requires accumulating from various sources. It is not comparable to other countries, where large quantities of grain can be procured immediately. Therefore, the wheat produced in the central provinces of our country can only supply the needs of flour mills for eight months. Coupled with the time and effort required for procurement, flour mills often have to reduce or stop production to wait for supplies. As a result, it is better to directly purchase foreign wheat to reduce losses. Moreover, the shortage of raw materials for several months each year necessitates supplementation with foreign wheat. A review of customs records shows that foreign wheat is imported into ports where flour mills are concentrated, such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and Hankou. In practice, almost all foreign wheat imports are used to supply flour mills.</p>
<p>3. Price Differences Between Domestic and Foreign Wheat and Imports</p>
<p>Since flour mills consume a large amount of wheat each year, they are keenly aware of the importance of raw material prices and must make careful selections. The profit of flour mills depends entirely on purchasing raw materials at low prices and selling finished products at high prices. The greater the difference between the two, the greater the profit. Therefore, flour mills naturally prefer lower wheat prices on the consumption side. On the production side, they hope for rising flour prices. This is an inevitable principle for operators and needs no concealment. Therefore, the choice of flour mills to use domestic or foreign wheat depends on the prices of the two. Firstly, regarding the price comparison between foreign and domestic wheat, if the price of foreign wheat is higher than that of domestic wheat, then it is beneficial to lower the market price of wheat before it is released to the market, so that it can be purchased in large quantities, as has been the case in the past. Let us look at the market prices for the past two years:</p>
<p>The above figures clearly show a downward trend from May to July. Although this year's market price is higher than in previous years, the flour price is also proportional. Based on this, the import of foreign wheat seems unnecessary. It would be better to purchase domestic wheat, but instead, foreign wheat is purchased to threaten the domestic wheat market price, making it difficult to increase, and resulting in only small gains. Imports can be reduced as a result. If the difference is very small, then the profit is large, which easily promotes the import of foreign wheat. Secondly, regarding the comparison between foreign wheat and flour prices, each picul of foreign wheat can produce 80 jin of flour. If the selling price of 80 jin of flour is equal to the price of wheat, then the remaining bran and other by-products can offset the expenses other than raw materials, making it profitable. If it exceeds the wheat price, then the profit is even greater, making it worthwhile to purchase foreign wheat. Therefore, the direct purchase of foreign wheat by flour mills is not only due to whether domestic wheat production is sufficient for supply, but the key is whether it is cost-effective. Moreover, foreign agricultural products are actively commercialized, relying on political and economic support to vigorously dump them overseas, in order to achieve their desire to invade the market. Domestic agricultural products find it even more difficult to compete with them and can only watch them continuously being imported.</p>
<p>Moreover, producers and consumers are always in a relative position, as mentioned above. What wheat farmers hope for is to sell at a good price, which is what flour mills do not want. Conversely, farmers are unwilling for flour mills to buy wheat at low prices. However, in this era of industrial development, raw materials are often controlled by industrialists and are not independent. Even in this case, the domestic bumper harvest and foreign wheat imports are a means of manipulating market prices. Domestic wheat can only squeeze out foreign wheat in the domestic market during the autumn season, because the new crops are released on the market, and the source is very strong, and foreign wheat has no place to intervene. After that, because farmers do not have long-term storage places or are eager to sell, they are sold at the time of marketing, so the first, second, and fourth seasons are periods when both domestic and foreign wheat are handled. Only flour mills are the largest consumers of wheat, and there is this contradictory phenomenon. This is probably a measure for industrialists to manipulate raw materials, and it is another reason for foreign wheat imports.</p>
<p>In summary, if flour mills in our country use foreign wheat due to insufficient domestic wheat production or the need to mix in a small amount of foreign wheat for technical reasons, then it is not entirely unacceptable to purchase foreign wheat for adjustment. However, if foreign wheat is purchased in a year of bumper harvest or when new wheat is about to enter the market, then it is inevitable that there will be other motives. If so, then it will not only directly destroy the interests of farmers, but also indirectly shake the foundation of the country. As for the large-scale purchases by Japanese merchants this time, the impact on people's livelihood is significant. However, in this era of internationalization of commodities, it may be difficult to achieve results by simply prohibiting it. We only hope that flour mills and grain merchants will cooperate, take into account the interests of people's livelihood, and purchase at fair prices, so that both parties can benefit. In addition, we hope that the authorities and both producers and consumers will make further efforts to: (1) improve the quality of wheat production to meet the standards of industrial raw materials; (2) increase production to meet domestic demand; (3) reduce transportation costs as much as possible to facilitate agricultural transportation; (4) establish more warehouses to prepare for longer-term storage; and (5) balance market prices to avoid speculative manipulation. If these aspects can be implemented step by step, then the entire issue of people's livelihood can be easily resolved, not just wheat alone.

<h3 id="e153">What are the Reasons for the Gradual Decline in Mulberry Fields? <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yinbei</p>
<p>Rice, wheat, cotton, silk, and tea are the foundation of our country's agricultural products. Among them, silk farming greatly benefits the circulation of the rural economy. However, since 1930, silkworm farming has not only been unprofitable for farmers, but also a burden that has resulted in losses. As a result, they have been removing mulberry trees that provide food for silkworms and planting other crops instead. Although we do not currently have accurate statistics for research, we can infer the general situation of the remaining mulberry fields in recent years by extrapolating from the decline in raw silk production. The following table lists the export trade of seven types of raw silk in the last five years (unit: dan).</p>
<p>Raw silk is a major commodity in our country's foreign trade. Apart from a small number of silk mills in the interior, the domestic market mainly depends on the sales situation of foreign firms. Although we cannot absolutely say that the gradual decline in raw silk export trade is the sole cause of the reduction in mulberry fields, we cannot deny that the gradual decline in raw silk figures reflects the decrease in the number of silkworms raised by silkworm farmers. This is an undeniable fact. As the number of silkworms raised by silkworm farmers decreases, the mulberry fields become oversupplied. If we further base our calculations on the feeding capacity of mulberry fields in Jiangsu Province, each mu of mulberry field can feed silkworms that produce eight jin of fresh cocoons (see Shanghai Current Affairs News on June 14, 1935, "The Sericulture Industry in Jiangsu Province"). Assuming that the silk reeling rate is 500 jin and the dry folding rate is 300, then producing one dan of raw silk requires 18.75 mu of mulberry field.——(One dan of raw silk × 500 reeling rate × 300 drying rate × 100 jin / 80 jin of fresh cocoons = 18.75 mu) Based on this calculation, the supply and demand situation of mulberry fields in recent years is as follows:</p>
<p>Since 1931, the leaves produced by mulberry fields have shown an increasing oversupply. In order to generate income from the surplus mulberry fields, silkworm farmers often remove the surplus mulberry fields and plant other crops instead. This situation is most prevalent in Wuxi and Jintan in Jiangsu, and Huzhou and Hangzhou in Zhejiang. This is mainly because the people in these rural areas rely on silkworm farming and mulberry planting as their main industries. Once the price of raw silk plummets, the number of silkworm farmers decreases sharply, resulting in significant losses from the surplus mulberry fields! Therefore, they have no choice but to plant rice and wheat to make up for the losses.</p>
<p>Next, what are the reasons for the silkworm farmers to abandon mulberry planting and switch to other crops? We can discuss this from the following three aspects:</p>
<p>(A) The Progress of Social Culture and the Transformation of Raw Silk Consumption. This is the fundamental reason for the movement of silkworm farmers abandoning mulberry planting and switching to other crops. It is found that the sales of raw silk in our country are mainly to the United States and France. However, since the invention of artificial silk, people around the world have undergone a remarkable shift in the production, promotion, and consumption of artificial silk. Among them, consumers have developed considerable confidence in artificial silk. Looking at the current silk fabrics, it is already impossible to demand purely raw silk woven products. On the weaving mill side, it is not an attempt to cut corners, but rather that consumers are psychologically pleased with the luster of artificial silk. This is a metabolism of the entire culture, which we cannot reverse. The International Silk Guild Inc. (established in August 1933 by the United States silk industry giants Qian Li and others, with the general office in New York) is a powerful organization for reviving raw silk promotion. However, it cannot use negative criticism to publicize the effect of artificial silk on consumers' psychology. In her inaugural declaration, she said: "In recent years, the silk industry, which has always been prosperous, has been completely invaded by artificial silk! Weaving factories are unwilling to initiate sponsoring publicity for any party because raw silk and artificial silk are used together. However, a few silk weavers still believe that the American raw silk industry should not be afraid of difficulties and should strive to develop raw silk: As for producing countries such as Japan, Italy, and China, they should cooperate with the American raw silk promotion groups. Efforts should be made to re-impress the advantages of raw silk into the minds of ordinary customers." Moreover, the more advanced science is, the more amazing inventions there will be: according to the Shanghai Financial Industry Report on December 6, 1933, the Japanese Fuji Silk Company is about to engage in the manufacture of "recycled silk." It is found that Ranxin Silk is a silk quality that Japanese people have painstakingly researched and successfully replaced artificial silk due to the lack of raw materials for artificial silk in their own country. The manufacturing method is to wash, bleach, and dissolve old silk or silk cocoon scraps using chemical methods, and then make them into silk using the method of manufacturing artificial silk. Therefore, the Japanese call it recycled silk. It is expected that once this silk comes out, it will add another kind of encroachment and crowding out to the future of raw silk.</p>
<p>(B) The Lagging Man-Made Economic Status. Secondly, the lagging man-made economic status is also a powerful reason. The lagging man-made economic status leads to the lagging international economic status. It must be known that raw silk is a commodity in the international market, and it is closely related to a country's politics, currency system, trade, and exchange rates. Our country is in a quasi-colonial status; every move is bound by others – in recent facts, due to the stability of exchange rates, export silk warp is more active than before.</p>
<p>(C) Silk costs, cocoon costs, and silkworm costs cannot be connected. In theory, the price of silk and cocoons is completely linked to the cost of silkworms. But the actual situation is not like this. Most surprisingly, the silkworm farmer's income and the factory's expenses are often not rationally aligned. This situation is caused by the current poor cocoon collection methods. It is found that the current method of collection is mostly entrusted by factories to village cocoon shops for collection. The expenses are so great that they are greater than any other industry. Therefore, even if factories spend a lot of money, it is difficult for them to purely flow into the hands of silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>We understand the root causes of this de-mulberry movement, so what is the future direction of planting mulberry and switching crops? Although this year's raw silk market price has improved slightly, and the price of fresh cocoons has increased compared to previous years, the difference from the silkworm farmer's cost is still huge. For example, when the spring fresh cocoon market opened in Wuxi, silkworm farmers in groups and teams went to various parties to petition, with the main goal of taking care of silkworm costs and striving for it. In other places, the same thing may be happening. Therefore, it is speculated that this de-mulberry movement is naturally lurking in rural villages everywhere and cannot be said to have been eliminated. For the sake of the current plan: on the passive side, we must plan to promote the cultivation of improved mulberry varieties to enhance their feeding capacity. On the active side, we must promote silkworm farming production cooperatives, especially focusing on the promotion of joint drying and selling, so as to replace the uneconomical cocoon collection by cocoon shops. All of these things, both directly and indirectly, are of great help to the mulberry retention problem.</p>
<h3 id="e154">The Process of Silkworm Farmers in Wuxi Self-Drying Cocoons <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Liangfeng</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the control of the silkworm farming industry in Wuxi, the variety, price, purchase, distribution, and management of silkworm eggs, cocoon shop collection, collection of improvement fees, and silkworm farming guidance have all had significant results. This spring (1936), the Wuxi Silkworm Farming Model Area and the Wuxi Farmers Bank have made efforts to promote self-drying cocoons by silkworm farmers, which has been quite effective. Since the implementation of legal tender in our country, the overseas exchange market has seen a leveling off, and the silk price conversion can be extremely volatile. Since the first half of 1935, the economic situation in the United States has gradually turned around, so the silk price has continued to rise, exports have increased, and the future has shown promise. Fresh cocoons are the agricultural products of farmers. In order to maintain production costs, farmers should have a price-setting position. If you want to have a price-setting position, you can only achieve it by drying fresh cocoons into dry cocoons. This spring, Wuxi has organized a large-scale cocoon collection company, hoping to monopolize the price of products, which may inevitably be manipulated and suppressed. This is especially important for farmers to dry cocoons themselves.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate farmers' self-drying cocoons, and to actively implement it, Jiangsu Province has specially formulated implementation methods for promoting cooperative silkworm production. On March 24, 1936, it was passed by the provincial government and ordered the Wuxi County Mayor to be the director of the Silkworm Farming Model Area, together with cooperative instructors, to use the central silkworm farming guidance center as a basis to guide silkworm farmers to organize business. Local people automatically organized more than 50 silkworm farming cooperatives, plus the original 20-plus production and marketing cooperatives, for a total of more than 80. All locations have been distributed throughout the county, so silkworm farmers' self-drying cocoons have a considerable organization.</p>
<p>Cooperative cocoon drying first needs to have cocoon stoves. If they are allowed to build them on their own, there may be difficulties in terms of economy and time. Therefore, the implementation methods for cooperative silkworm production stipulates that any cocoon shops and silkworm farming joint societies that have been approved by the model area to open the market have priority in renting them. However, this method has some difficulties in fact and environment. There are many single stoves in Wuxi rural areas that are less than four by four. For the sake of taking care of everything, the provincial government specially allows cooperatives to buy the cocoon stoves that should be banned and use them for members to dry cocoons. In various cocoon shops, they can turn useless into useful, and in various cooperatives, they can also get suitable cocoon stoves. It is also stipulated that if cooperatives lack funds, they are allowed to temporarily rent them before they are purchased. This spring, the Wuxi County Silkworm Farming Model Area approved a total of 47 cocoon shops for cooperatives to rent. (Several cooperatives use one cocoon shop, so the number of cocoon shops is less than the number of cooperative societies.) A total of 130 single stoves and 4 double stoves were opened. Among them, 6 are qualified cocoon shops, and the rest are unqualified cocoon shops that have been sealed.</p>
<p>In order to support the cooperatives' cocoon drying, the Wuxi Farmers Bank also specially signed a silk cocoon bank and formulated methods for accepting cooperative self-drying cocoons and lending drying expenses. If various cooperatives feel that they lack funds when operating cocoon drying and sales, the persons in charge of each cooperative can borrow from the bank. The following is an excerpt of the method. (1) Any dry cocoons that cooperative members jointly dry can borrow money from the bank, but they must meet the following conditions:</p>
<p>A, The dry cocoons must be piled into the silk cocoon warehouse designated by the bank.</p>
<p>B, The cocoon body is good;</p>
<p>C, The degree of drying is uniform and appropriate;</p>
<p>D, Must be determined by the person in charge of the cooperative to the bank; (1) The mortgage price is 60% of the market price; (1) The mortgage period is up to five months; (1) The interest rate is 9/1000 per month, calculated daily; (1) Any cooperative may borrow from the bank for the drying expenses required for baking fresh cocoons, but it must be handled in accordance with the following articles: A, When applying for a loan, the number of dry cocoons baked by the members must be estimated first, and the bank's investigation must be confirmed;</p>
<p>B, Each dry cocoon is allowed to borrow 6 yuan in national currency;</p>
<p>C, The loan period is up to one month;</p>
<p>D, The interest rate is 9/1000 per month, calculated daily;</p>
<p>Looking at the cooperative, from drying cocoons to finance, they have received considerable assistance, and everything can be carried out smoothly.</p>
<p>This spring, there is no survey statistics on the number of cocoons dried by the various cooperatives. However, it can be estimated from the improvement fees paid by the cooperatives. As of the end of August, the cooperatives in the county paid a total of 9,431 yuan in improvement fees. Calculating the improvement fee of 4.5 yuan per dry cocoon, it can be seen that a total of 2,096 dry cocoons were dried. Estimating that the maximum number of fresh cocoons is 200 jin per dry cocoon, the estimated number of fresh cocoons is 6,288 dan. Calculated by the total improvement fee of 210,000 yuan in the county, the number of self-dried cocoons only accounts for 4.4% of the county. The number is extremely small and needs to be promoted. It is also found that this spring's tear price in Wuxi County was 11 yuan. Since the spring cocoon has a love market, the price overseas has frequently risen, and the dry cocoon market price has also risen accordingly. Each dry cocoon (old silk) can be sold for 170 yuan, which is equivalent to 140 yuan per market. Each cooperative followed up with the sale of dry cocoons at any time, calculating that it could add more than 10 yuan per ancestral home compared to selling fresh cocoons. From the time the fresh cocoons go on the market to the sale of dry cocoons, it took less than two months, and the increase in income for silkworm farmers in the cocoon baking was a total of more than 60,000 yuan, which is no small amount.</p>
<p>Statistics show that a total of 12 cooperatives deposited their self-dried cocoons with the Wuxi Farmers Bank, depositing more than 280 ancestral cocoons, with a total outstanding mortgage of more than 22,000 yuan, accounting for 1.8% of the total number of self-dried cocoons. All those who apply for bank mortgages for use are jointly transported and sold. Those who do not apply for mortgages take back and sell in retail after baking. The entire collective action is still lacking, and more attention should be paid in the future. Those who jointly bake should be based on the principle of joint sales, so as to avoid the exploitation of middlemen.</p>
<p>This spring, all farmers who dry their own cocoons have made a profit. In my opinion, it is proposed that a considerable percentage of the profits be withdrawn as a public reserve fund to be used for improving silkworm farming, or as a foundation for building cocoon stoves, or to offset accidental losses. If this public reserve fund can be withdrawn on time, the number will accumulate more and more, and the foundation will become more and more solid. It is extremely important for the baking and transport business and cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>Last week, August 10th to 15th, the Chinese Securities Exchange, due to the unresolved situation in Guangxi, led to a sluggish public bond market. Li Bai's attitude was unpredictable, initially moderate and respectful, then chaotic and stubborn. Since President Chiang's arrival in Guangdong, the situation has become increasingly tense. Peace or war is at its final stage, but obstructing unification with just a corner of land must be resolved in the shortest time possible. The bond market, in this atmosphere of turmoil, is shaken and uncertain, causing widespread caution. In addition, the Suidong rebellion cannot be ignored, and the future feels thorny. The bond market, already at its peak, is prone to decline. A slight relaxation can trigger a drop. Many investors are preparing to exit, and changes are imminent. Last week, rumors of a new national reconstruction bond issue on Monday were rampant. Li Bai's attitude was chaotic. On the 11th and 16th, it was sold off, falling slightly by one or two jiao to seven jiao. On Tuesday, due to some short covering on the 10th, confidence returned, and with no changes in the environment, it slightly improved by one to four jiao. On Wednesday, President Chiang's arrival in Guangdong showed more determination towards Guangxi, boosting morale again, and selling pressure intensified. The 4th, 10th, 16th, and 47th bonds were sold off again, falling back by four or five jiao. On Thursday, Li Bai's attitude was stubborn, making a compromise unlikely. Both bulls and bears were cautious, and the market was sluggish. On Friday, news seemed to turn positive, and sensitive investors bought in again. However, the 4th, 5th, and 16th bonds continued to be sold off, but the market price suddenly rose by as much as three to seven jiao due to retail investors covering shorts. On Saturday, negotiations with Guangxi had reached an impasse, and war seemed inevitable. The [bond] numbers were sold off even more aggressively than before, falling back by one to four jiao. Due to the volatile environment and approaching settlement dates, coupled with the upcoming issuance of national reconstruction bonds, market price fluctuations are frequent. The result for the week showed mostly small gains or losses of one or two jiao to four jiao. This month's Ding and Yi classes, however, rose by one and a half jiao to three and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was 25.93 million yuan. The price changes are compared and listed on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e156">Talking About Avoiding the Heat <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— (Cai Xuanqing)</p>
<p>People who walk and work in the heat all day long are less likely to suffer from heatstroke, while those who leisurely avoid the heat are more susceptible to it. Farmers in the countryside work in the fields all day long, exposed to the scorching sun, sweating profusely, yet they don't seem to suffer from any illness and are even stronger than others. Wealthy families, living in high-rise buildings with electric fans and air conditioning, completely shielded from the heat, feel as if they are in a cool world, no longer aware of the misery of summer heat. If they occasionally have to go out, their bodies, long separated from the heat, are most easily harmed by the summer heat. The rain and sunshine, yin and yang, cold and heat of nature are meant to nurture and temper people and things. Without them, development and growth would feel incomplete. Therefore, there is no need to avoid the heat so much. Recently, envoys from various friendly nations and important figures from our country have flocked to Qingdao, Beidaihe, and Guling, and even more wealthy people have gone to Japan, all seeking to escape the oppressive summer heat. If these are talents relied upon by the nation, of course they should be carefully protected. But let me tell two old stories: During the Song Dynasty, Duke Wei Zhang Jun supervised the army to resist the Jin invaders. His two generals, Shao Hongyuan and Li Xianzong, had long disagreed. Just as a decisive battle was planned, Xianzong heard this and exclaimed loudly, "In this intense heat, it is unbearable even to wave a fan in the coolness, let alone engage in battle!" As a result, the army's morale collapsed, leading to a defeat at Fuliji and a retreat of over two hundred li. During the Qing Dynasty, Zeng Zhongxiang Guo Quan supervised the army to attack Jinling. He led his troops out on the first day of the sixth month and captured the provincial capital by the sixteenth day of the sixth month, fighting fiercely in the sweltering heat for half a month without rest. These two stories show that one sought leisure in the summer heat and failed the nation, while the other endured hardship in the summer heat and achieved success. I write them down as material for gentlemen avoiding the heat to chat about under bean arbors and melon trellises.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Escaping the Heat in Eastern Yin <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhen</p>
<p>The south wind steams dreams, and the oppressive heat torments people. Sweating in the city buildings, I can no longer bear it, and leisurely imagine the mountains and forests. In the early morning, I lightly set out from Wusong and arrived at Jiaochuan. At the corner of Zhaobao, the morning mist had not yet dispersed, and vaguely, I felt an intention to rise up and overturn the heavens. Winding and turning several times, I reached Yin; after a week in the city, I passed Baochuang on a roundabout. It was a rural market, desolate and unremarkable, but the incense flourished at the Ashoka Temple, opening the path in its midst, and truly holding the lifeline of the mountain families. Hundreds of people live around the temple, and whether they are farmers or laborers, their clothing and food all depend on the mountains. The mountain monks' breathing is revered by all, and no one dares to make noise. Those above and below live in harmony, a hidden paradise. Entering the temple, I was delighted to see its magnificent Buddhist realm, with towering halls. The land was secluded and spacious, without the labor of climbing steep mountains, and the city was hidden without being noisy. Traveling by water was without hardship, making it most suitable for female protectors to form incense alliances, showering the ground with money, and creating a magnificent image in the corner, lasting for a long time without change. However, Cao Xi's scoop, viewed with eyes seeking the secluded and scenic, could not help but feel that entering the mountain was not deep enough, and leaving the secular world was not far enough. Thus, I hurriedly left. Entering Tiantong from Shaobai, the double oars chased the wind, my heart wanted to dissolve. The peaks turned, and the road ahead was completely lost. The sky was dark blue, and the water mirror reflected the green. The small boats brushed past the shadows of the trees, and my sleeves were all blue, as if sitting in heaven. By chance, not for the first time, I sat on the boat and sang: "Layer upon layer of mountain mist connects to Maoyang, double oars break through the waves, passing five villages. A stream circles and opens the earth's veins, four mountains enclose the light of the sky; strangely dressed people catch the eye, forgetting the year of the Jiazi cycle, ten miles of temple depth, monks chant in silence, one almost suspects a farming village exists outside this world." To the east are Maoyang and Lingfeng Mountains, also pure land of the Jetavana Garden. Coming from the five villages, the mountain people are simple and unadorned, straight as a string, running through dozens of miles. In the level fields between the ridges, one occasionally sees ancient clothing and whiskers like molted shells, harmonious above the sounds of Kangqu. The summer heat has been half-cleansed. Leaving the boat, I put on my wax-soled shoes and entered the path to Tiantong, climbing the slopes. Ancient cedars blocked the sky, and chaotic pines lined the road. The thick shade was like water, and the rustling of the pines shook my sleeves, creating a deep coolness. Mountain birds flattered me with their clear sounds, chasing away the summer heat for me. Circling the pine path, light waves passed over my head, pouring down like midday thunder, and my soul dissolved with it. Slightly turning, a huge pool appeared in front of me, a paradise for fish. Crossing the pool, I saw a faint yellow gap among the green shadows, and the temple gate slowly appeared. Secluded and mysterious, it could be said that the Ashoka Temple lay at my feet, as one could not even glimpse a spot a hundred steps away. Entering the gate, I walked around the corridors, and the Buddhist halls were high and spacious, no different from Ashoka's, but between each window and railing, lush greenery filled everything. A faint ray of sunlight passed through, and the wild horses did not leap, a quiet interest entered my heart, and all remaining worries ceased. Sitting in the guest hall, I asked for food, and the abbot spoke in a way that was pleasing to me. Leaving and walking around the mountains, my mood became more relaxed, and clear thoughts slowly emerged, and I no longer thought about leaving the mountain. I rested briefly in the stone forest, the stream purling at my elbow. The old trees called to the dragons, and the cool breeze blew through my hair. The evening birds were silent, and various flowers were on the trees. I closed my eyes and meditated, as if sitting in a hollow mulberry tree. When the wind stopped, the fragrance of flowers was faint, and the clear chanting was faintly heard descending from the sky. The bell rang once, and all sounds were silent. Suddenly waking up, I took my cane and returned to the temple, as if the lingering dream had not yet faded. After dinner, I brewed tea and sought out a monk to chat with. We only talked about the scenery and did not expound on the Dharma. Sitting in the tea-scented room, I straightened my temples, and all thoughts died. Before long, the monk went to bed, and the moon peeped at people, shining like water. My heart floated like a wisp of silk. In the midst of the ethereal, the pine waves suddenly roared, and the dark valleys angrily expanded, touching the empty valley and creating strange sounds. The universe shook, and the small room was filled with ten thousand thoughts. Then, the clear chime broke the dream, and the dawn chanting calmed the heart. I leaped up and awoke, and I did not know how Wen Shu and the pines would be again.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Watching the Waterfall at Laoshan <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Mengqi</p>
<p>Those who travel to famous mountains either sail the sea in advance, or drive by land. Having arrived at the mountain, those who have difficulty walking will be carried in sedan chairs. Sea voyages suffer from wind and waves, and powerful people often use warships to help them cross. Land travel means hiring a car into the mountains, without worrying about bumps. Traveling to the mountains as scheduled for a day or two is like seeing immortals above the clouds, vague and uncertain, and it is difficult to explore the wonders of even a tenth of the mountain.</p>
<p>The day after I visited Diangang Bay, my interest was greatly aroused. I gathered my companions and planned to visit the Taiqing Palace. At that time, it was sometimes cloudy, sometimes rainy, and sometimes sunny. When the car reached Dalao Village, the rain suddenly became heavy, the water vapor was dense, and the clouds and mountains were mistaken for each other. A hundred steps away, the mud was flowing down, and we could not move forward. We were greatly frightened and quickly retreated. Our faces were covered with yellow slurry, and we looked at each other in dismay. The car stopped by the Shahe River. A rapid stream faced us, looking like it was rushing, and when we tested it, it reached our stomachs and was too deep to cross. The men and women of the nearby village came to watch. When asked about visiting the Huayan Temple, they all shook their heads, indicating that it was impossible. If we wanted to travel, we could only hire sedan chairs to cross the water to the Shenqing Palace at Huahualang. Huahualang is a waterfall. I thought that during this rainy season, there would definitely be a spectacle, so I left the car, put on a bamboo hat, and hired a sedan chair. First, we crossed the Shahe River. The river was about five zhang wide, and the current was turbulent. The chair carriers walked like crabs, and the passengers closed their eyes, afraid to look left or right. We arrived at Dalao Temple in the east, rested for a while, and then turned south, winding up to the Shenqing Palace. We sat down for a while, sipped tea, and chatted with the old Taoist about mulberry and hemp. Going down from the Shenqing Palace, the rain had subsided, the clouds were hazy, the sunlight was faintly leaking, the mountains were flowing, and the green was intensified. Those behind saw those in front, and their white clothes were all blue-black. Wild flowers exhaled fragrance, and vines pulled at our skirts. We did not realize that our souls and bones were all green, and we immediately regretted that we could not quickly transform into deer and wild birds. Four or five village girls each peeked through the gaps in the fence, exchanging love songs with the chair carriers. Their cloud-like hair and slender feet were just like the people of thirty years ago. We crossed the Liucun River, entered the mountains, and gradually went deeper, walking among scattered chaotic rocks. The mountain path, which seemed to exist before, became increasingly unattainable as we advanced. We crossed the Liushui River fourteen times, and there were no villages or dog barks to be seen. Black clouds pressed down, and thunder rolled on the rocks. Following the last stream to the east, we zigged and zagged seven or eight times in no more than one or two li. From afar, we heard the loud roar of the waterfall, but we could not find it. After another li or so, a drizzle started again, and the cold was like late autumn. The rain was as fine as mist, and people could not distinguish their clothes face to face. The sedan chair moved very slowly. Suddenly, we heard the people in front shouting: "The waterfall is here!" Looking into the distance, the mountains were like a ring, and the road ahead was blocked. A steep cliff of a thousand ren, and the waterfall poured down from a break in the middle of the ring, fearing more than ten zhang, and also a zhang wide; suspended like white silk, we could not tell where it came from. Tall pine trees grew beside the waterfall, and old vines covered the cliffs, swaying with green and flying, turning our sleeves into a rosy cloud. We got out of the sedan chair and walked against the waterfall in the stream, braving the rain, not bothered by the chaotic rocks and rapid currents. Five zhang away from the waterfall, we could no longer move forward. We sat on a precarious rock, quietly contemplating: That rushing stream, clear and cold, from distant times to now, never resting day or night; I wonder if going out of the mountain is the same as being in the mountain? How can I transform into thousands of bodies, travel through the streams and valleys, and examine what I encounter! Below the waterfall, the water strikes the stones and breaks them into holes, the holes fold into streams, the streams fold into gullies, and into beaches. The reason why there was no path to get here before is probably because of this. Four or five wild children, all four or five years old, strong and healthy like adults, played naked in the spring, just like ducks in the spring river.</p>
<p>When the sun was setting, we urged each other to return. On the way, the sound of the spring was like a gong, like a pipe, like a , like silk , like jade pendants, mixing together, sending us off, along with the sounds of singing and poetry. We returned to Shahe River, and the water had not decreased much. The chair carriers did not choose a shallow place to cross, and the passengers' clothes were all wet. We laughed together without stopping.</p>
<p>We stayed at Li Village, and the sound of the spring was on the pillow.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Braving the Dangers of Mount Hua <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Mount Hua is in my hometown of Shaanxi, but I have lived far away for a long time. It was not until this year that I was able to fulfill my long-cherished wish for a grand tour.</p>
<p>The paths of Mount Hua are famous for their steepness, but what interests me most is the danger of the roads. The "Thousand-Foot Precipice" is a narrow, protruding path sandwiched between two mountains. People must pull themselves up with iron chains and crawl on their knees to move forward! There is also the "Azure Dragon Ridge," which is built on a very long mountain ridge, with no support on either side and a bottomless abyss below! Walking on such a dangerous road, one cannot help but feel their heart pounding! But after passing through it, there is a sense of triumphant joy. There are also places like "Monkey's Worry," "Ladder to Heaven," "Ear-Scraping Cliff," and "Rotten Wooden Rubber," whose names alone can tell you the degree of their danger.</p>
<p>The posture of Mount Hua is majestic and grand. Its height of five thousand zhang may not be the highest record, but when I entered the mountain, every turn brought a change to my eyes, and the changes were so magical that they filled my heart and refreshed my eyes. And the coolness of the mountain is even better for escaping the heat.</p>
<p>The scenery of Mount Hua is beautiful and varied. In front of the mountain, there are winding waterfalls. At the foot of the mountain, there are lush forests. The entire mountain has twenty-four stone caves. On the eastern peak is the "Hua Yue Immortal Palm," one of the eight scenic spots of Chang'an. Tang Dynasty poems: "Jade hibiscus on the immortal's palm" refers to this place. As for historical sites, there are "Laojun Hanging the Plow," "Chen Bo's Chess Pavilion," "Emperor Wu Asks the Way," and "Han Yu Throws a Book," which are too numerous to count.</p>
<p>The sedan chair of Mount Hua is very interesting. It is a round chair with a backrest, with two long bamboo poles on either side. People sit in the chair, leaning tightly against the backrest, and two people lift it up, considering it a tool for walking up the mountain. When going down the mountain, the chair is turned over, with the backrest in front, and the person's chest and abdomen are on the backrest to prevent falling. This kind of mountain chair is called "Hua Gan" by the locals.</p>
<p>There is a path out of Mount Hua, most of which is connected with iron ropes, and one must rely on the iron ropes to climb. There is a local saying: "If you want to find a corpse, go to Shangzhou, Henan." The meaning of these two sentences is that when going up and down the mountain, if you accidentally fall, then you have to go to the neighboring province to find the corpse! In fact, you only need to "step firmly on the ground and be careful every step" (someone has carved these words on the mountain) and there will be no danger. The mountain is divided into five peaks: east, west, south, north, and center. The east, west, and south peaks stand like tripods, and the highest is the south peak. At the top of the south peak, there is a pool of spring water facing the sky, called "Yangtian Pool." I lingered by the pool for half a day, looking down at the peaks below the clouds, and the earth beyond the mountains. For the first time, I felt the vastness that nature has given us.</p>

<p>— Shufan</p>
<p>White clouds rise in the mountains, evening cooking smoke rises below, for there are cloud-watchers, a whole summer is enough to live on. Cool breeze's kindness reaches to the bone, don't blow it down to the ground! When it blows, the rivers and lakes grow cold, who will bother to come up the mountain? Heaven's heart divides warmth and coolness, we laborers have our rest, how can we get a generous government official, who pours down the scorching sun all the time! May the mountain be like a bamboo shoot in spring, growing ever taller! Every step is worth gold, and the reed bunting chirps in the green spring.</p>
<h3 id="e162">A Record of Victory on the Southern Peak of Mount Kuang <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Shufan</p>
<p>I have long admired the beauty of Mount Lu! Unfortunately, I was burdened by secular affairs and unable to fulfill my wish. By chance, I met Fenfeng, Liu, Mengzhao, Tao Tan, and asked about the Upper Qing ruins. They allowed me to stay for two nights and asked me to be their guide. Thinking that it would only take a day and night to rush from Ying to Mount Kuang, I strongly advocated a side trip. We agreed and set sail from Qiantang, traveling upstream along the Yanxi River, passing through Jiande and Jinlan, and setting foot in the Three Caves. We reviewed our old travels, each one a source of sadness, and I recorded all my thoughts and feelings separately in writing. From Jin entering Gan, the flying boat went against the coolness, and my heart was refreshed. The spirit of those serving on the carriages and horses seemed far inferior to that of half a year ago, and the person in charge should urgently improve this! Along the line, the original fields have been turned into money, showing signs of recovery, truly, governance and livelihood are nurtured, and the people's exhaustion is not to be feared. From there, we went to Nanchang and Jiujiang, followed Lotus Cave, and reached Guling. The stone steps were winding and circling, a total of seventeen miles. Although I was sick and stumbling, the clouds and mist emerging from my elbows were a great spectacle. Guling occupies the center of Mount Kuang, where inns and residences are scattered, and everything is arranged in order, a cool place for high officials and wealthy merchants. It was midsummer, and the sounds of zithers and songs floated from each window at noon, and I immediately forgot the heat. In the evening, the fragrant breeze trailed shadows, and I felt like ascending to immortality. The only problem was that prices were too high, and those below the middle class could not afford to stay long. The most wonderful things in the mountains are water and clouds; streams and waterfalls are everywhere, and daytime is like thunder, this is the wonder of water; without rain, it is misty and without cold, like jade catkins, this is the transformation of clouds. Most of the majestic, secluded, and strange places are on the peaks and in the deep valleys, which Guling does not have. However, cutting paths back and forth, often dozens or hundreds of miles, travelers all abandoned their staffs and shoes, so the price of sedan chairs was particularly high. We believe that exploring the mountains is about suiting one's nature, and our movements are up to us, relying on our own strength; if taking a sedan chair is just making ourselves comfortable, we neither desire nor lack such fortune. We packed our luggage, set out for the secluded southern mountains, headed from the inn to Hankou Gorge, circled around the Red Road, and at the Horizontal Gate, we saw the clouds opening, and the main peaks appeared one by one. After another two miles, we climbed Hanpokou, where the Five Old Peaks towered halfway to the sky, as if wanting to scoop up a spoonful of water from Poyang Lake. South of the ridge, it overlooks the Hukou, and looking to the extreme, the sails are strong, mixing with the chaotic green of the mountains at the tail of Chu, vast and unparalleled. Nearby, sand islets floated in purple, the sunset reflecting, the interest was in a water painting. To the west, the Nine Odd Peaks were like a folding screen, ringed and inserted, bordering the blue sky, and hanging waterfalls, the wind blowing as if cutting off. Slightly east, second only to the Five Old Peaks, were the Taiyi Plowhead Peaks, their stone shapes like fire, burning brightly, standing tall and not yielding to each other. The ridge used to have a pavilion, and now it has been increased to three, a long slope hanging upside down, the tail of Tuanshan. Following the right cliff, we picked our way down, for a total of six thousand five hundred steps, and reached Baihejian; looking back at the waist of Taiyi Peak, another practice was released, the midday thunder roaring angrily, and the silver armor broke through the blue, that is, the Baihuicao flowing from the Three Stone Beams; rushing into the stream, in a turbulent manner. Further down was Bingxian Valley, filled with lush green, unfathomable. We reached Sanxia Stream. The stones were startled as if to run, and the sound of the water was even louder. The streams of Tuanshan and Changlong all converge here, for a total of ninety-nine. The ancients compared its seclusion and danger to the Kui Gorge, hence this name. Crossing the stream, we reached a temple, where Li Bo of the Tang Dynasty read books, the ruined foundation and crumbling walls, the bells and drums were silent; only the ground faced the rushing stream, and the back rested against the mountains, looking up at the beautiful appearance of the Five Old Peaks, especially clear, so the Zhi has the words "a secluded valley that is the best in one mountain." The temple houses Qing Dynasty Luohan portraits, totaling one hundred and eighty-one scrolls. Between the zhang-wide paintings, their actions, postures, smiles, and words, their spirits and forms are complete, interspersed with changes in birds, animals, trees, and stones, making them even more Qing Yan and profound. Unfortunately, Kang Changsu affixed his seal to each one, hoping to pass them on together, which was inevitable! Leaving the temple, we advanced along the stream and arrived at Yuyuan Pond, a , and the water vapor was awe-inspiring. There are many stone carvings around the pool, and more than half of them are blurred, but Mi Fu's poem can still be read, and Zhang Xiaoxiang's inscription of the two characters "Yujian" is still vigorous as before. Further south, the stones all bind the stream, becoming high and low, the blue walls rising and falling sharply, forming banks and bottoms; thus marveling at the craftsmanship of the creator! We reached Qixian Bridge, cutting off a large ravine, blocking the angry , and the shock almost made us unable to hold ourselves. The bridge was built in the seventh year of the Song Dynasty's Xiangfu period, and although the valleys have changed, the pillars are still intact, and the firmness of the structure is evident. Tracing back from Baihejian to here, we have crossed three rainbows, so it is also called Three Stone Beams. To the east of the bridge is a spring called Zhaoyin, which Lu Yu once rated as the sixth best in the world. At that time, the green sun was falling to the west, and the peaks were slowly turning into clouds, like cooking pots lined up. We planned to explore more of the wonders of Wanshan and Xiufeng, but when we asked the locals, they all stuck out their tongues and said: It's getting late, you won't be able to return! We had no choice but to return the way we came, the steps were steep, facing us, and we had to raise our feet to our chests, making it twice as difficult as going down the mountain; our withered feet exhausted and sweating, we finally reached Hanpokou, and looking at the lake waves changing in the setting sun, we were once again happy and forgot our form.</p>

<p>Chapter Five: The Brocade Xi Character Returns to Paint the Emerald Leaves, The Wedding Dress Is Startled at First Try, Tears Wet the Silk Veil</p>
<p>On the central table, there were several things that were very eye-catching: a stack of Xi character flowers cut from red paper, and two velvet paper boxes with red Xi characters pasted on them. In any family, having things like this on the table would be related to a grown man or woman. The two sons of the Jiang family had been married for many years. The two young ladies, the older one Menglan, and the younger one Zhaohui, were still young. Menglan, such a clever person, didn't need to study it carefully; she had already guessed it completely and thought to herself, "The day is near!" Before, she had expressed to her mother repeatedly that she couldn't get married until after graduation. Looking at the current situation, the letter that came yesterday showed that the family completely agreed. Furthermore, perhaps the matter had been discussed and settled long before yesterday; otherwise, how could the Xi characters be prepared so quickly? Menglan thought a lot of things back and forth in her mind for a while. She forgot to go to school and stood blankly in the room, only to hear a thud under her feet. She then woke up and looked down to see that the briefcase she had been carrying under her arm last night had somehow fallen to the ground. She bent over to pick up the briefcase, and the sweeping maid had already been startled. She smiled and said, "Oh! Miss, why are you standing here in a daze? Is something wrong? It's getting late; hurry up and go to school." As she spoke, she quickly swept the things on the table to the next room. Menglan smiled and whispered, "Aren't you just telling me to be busy? I already saw it." After speaking, she clipped the briefcase a little and walked out. In her heart, she continued thinking, "Looking at it this way, what I'm about to face is a kind of marriage of convenience. If I'm too embarrassed to speak up, then I'll let them sell me. It's people like Zhang Litian, who have nothing to do with my joys and sorrows, who can sincerely advise me. When it comes to my own livelihood and seeking my own lifelong happiness, the only way is to break away from the shackles of this family." Thinking about it from all these aspects, she forgot the original plan of avoiding Zhang Guoqi on her way to school this morning and still took the usual route to school. When she reached the alley where she usually met Guoqi, she suddenly realized that she had still come to this place. Since she was already here, it would be good to meet him and talk for a few words. Because, from what she saw now, people who connected through writing were more reliable. At least, at least, he could give people some comfort in writing. So, she deliberately slowed down her pace, but she hesitated and thought, "Maybe he's also a bit worried and won't walk this way." If he wasn't walking this alley, she might as well go meet him in another alley. She didn't have to say anything; just meeting him would give him great comfort. (Sixty-one)</p>

<h3 id="e164">The Success of Gonorrhea Treatment and Matters Needing Attention When Patients Choose Medicine <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Medical Doctor from the Russian Labor Medical University</p>
<p>Dr. Peter Riedel's advice and indignant words: There is only one truth, do not be deceived by pseudo-science.</p>
<p>In the old medical field, there has long been the cry of "gonorrhea heals without medicine," which is a well-known fact. Although there are many preparations, they are nothing more than combinations of sandalwood oil and cubeb, etc. In the end, they only have local diuretic and anti-inflammatory effects. However, they presumptuously claim to be able to penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria. Even if they can achieve the purpose of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, it is only a local effect. The gonococci and toxins residing in various parts of the body, other than the mucous membranes of the urethra and genitals, cannot be eliminated.</p>
<p>In the past, due to the immaturity of science, it was natural that there were no special drugs to overcome gonorrhea. Recently, science has prospered and medicine has advanced rapidly, and the latest theory of qualitative treatment of gonorrhea has been established. Scholars unanimously and enthusiastically support it, and it has become an authority on the theory and treatment of gonorrhea! I was deeply impressed by this when I studied medicine in Russia. After Dr. Peter Biedel of Germany adopted drug experiments, he prepared a special chemical composition and formulated "Keling Nong," a special medicine for overcoming gonorrhea. This medicine is uniquely capable of increasing the qualitative effect of the whole body's anti-gonococcal phagocytosis, which is unmatched by any gonorrhea medicine in the world. I have repeatedly used this medicine at home and abroad to treat various acute and chronic gonorrhea leucorrhea in men and women, as well as prostatitis orchitis (male) and vaginal and uterine gonorrhea (female), arthritis and other serious diseases, and all have been effective. Continuous use for six weeks to a maximum of ten weeks will completely eradicate the disease. Because there are more and more people buying and using it, there are many pseudo-scientific drugs that imitate "Keling Nong". Peter has expressed deep indignation about this in medical conferences, and published a nearly ten thousand-word letter to patients, which will not be recorded due to space limitations. In short, there is only one truth. Apart from "Keling Nong", there is no special medicine to be found.</p>

<h3 id="e165">The Relationship between Leucorrhea and Bacteria <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zongyu, Army Medical University</p>
<p>Eliminating bacteria is the key to curing leucorrhea; a new trend in leucorrhea treatment</p>
<p>In many women, 70% of leucorrhea is caused by bacteria. Why do bacteria only act in the female genitalia? This is because the mucous membrane in this part is moist, which is most suitable for bacterial reproduction. However, there is also a kind of vaginal bacteria in the female genitalia, which specializes in resisting foreign bacteria. If these vaginal bacteria are underdeveloped, reduced, or eliminated, foreign bacteria can take advantage of it, thereby destroying the mucous membrane tissue and causing leucorrhea. If it goes deeper into the uterus and ovaries, it will become uterine inflammation and ovarian inflammation, making treatment even more difficult.</p>
<p>In general leucorrhea, "Carder's vaginal tablets" can be used alone to reduce inflammation, prevent corrosion, kill bacteria, disinfect, and promote the reproduction of beneficial vaginal bacteria to cure leucorrhea. If menstrual irregularities are caused by leucorrhea, "Bu Nu Rong" can be taken to adjust it. If it is caused by gonorrheal leucorrhea, the gonococci penetrate deeply into the inside, and "Carder's vaginal tablets" cannot reach it. Therefore, in addition to using this tablet as a suppository, "Keling Nong" must be taken internally to eliminate internal gonococci. With this treatment, gonorrheal leucorrhea can be effective in a short period of time. This is something that other leucorrhea medicines cannot achieve.</p>

<p>Under the old family system, it almost meant sacrifice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dai Yun, who lives on Henan Road, has a deep affection with her husband, but her family is still inseparable from the old forces. Everything is conservative and rejects new things. A few months ago, Mrs. Dai became pregnant and gave birth. She hired an old-fashioned midwife to deliver the baby. The disinfection was not complete, and the postpartum care was mostly illegal, which caused complications. Fever and chills came and went. At first, she consulted a Chinese medicine doctor, who diagnosed it as postpartum tuberculosis, but the medicine did not work for a long time. Her body became weaker and weaker, she had dizziness and insomnia, her heart was weak, and her face was bloodless, showing extreme anemia. Later, she changed many doctors, but none of them had any effect. Her physical strength was further consumed. Fortunately, she was persuaded by her neighbors and encouraged by her husband's colleagues to change to a new doctor. Introduced by her friend Liang Shaoqing, she came to my clinic for treatment. She was given a large amount of "Bu Nu Rong" as an internal medicine, and she was also ordered to take more nourishing food. She saw a turning point in four or five days, and the dangerous situation had passed. The whole family was overjoyed and continued to buy "Bu Nu Rong" from various pharmacies for six or seven weeks. Her spirit was greatly increased, her physical strength was strong, and her face was full of blood, and she was still a healthy woman. "Bu Nu Rong" also has the effect of regulating menstruation, seeds, and treating underdevelopment, leucorrhea, neurasthenia, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Caused by "Masturbation" <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>

<p>Premature ejaculation with peripheral seminal fluid, the disadvantages of nocturnal emission and the method of root treatment</p>
<p>Clinic: Across from the Tonghe Bank on Ningbo Road</p>
<p>The pathology of premature ejaculation and nocturnal emission is a nervous system disease of function. The reason is mostly due to swelling and sensitivity of the seminal vesicles. Inflammation of the seminal vesicles is caused by masturbation during the development period, or by gonorrhea. Inflammation of the seminal vesicles leads to damage to the ejaculation center. As a result, nocturnal emission occurs at night, spermatorrhea occurs during the day, etc., or premature ejaculation occurs as soon as intercourse begins. The individual's spirit and the couple's pleasure are consumed, and some may induce impotence.</p>
<p>The only condition for the root treatment of premature ejaculation and nocturnal emission is to eliminate seminal vesiculitis and suppress the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center. The preparation with this complex effect is "Yu Jing Pian". At the same time, it is necessary to cultivate and supplement its hormone function and strengthen the sexual nerves, so it is advisable to take the hormone preparation "Bu Ti Kang" at the same time. Those caused by gonorrhea can take "Keling Nong". Patient Bao Shiyuan suffered from extreme neurasthenia, kidney failure, premature ejaculation, insomnia, forgetfulness, nocturnal emission, and back pain due to masturbation and early marriage. Taking medicine hindered his reproductive glands, which made the disease worse. After my diagnosis, I had to transform his ejaculation function, so I instructed him to buy "Yu Jing Pian" from the Zhongxi Pharmacy to treat nocturnal emission, and to take "Bu Ti Kang" to strengthen the kidneys. After taking three bottles of each, he was completely cured in five weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Examples of Experimental Treatment for Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Dai De</p>
<p>Patient Zheng, who has been teaching in Shanghai for four years, is now 27 years old and from Wuxi. He came to my clinic in early spring to seek treatment for nocturnal emission, wet dreams, insomnia, forgetfulness, back pain, dizziness, and other symptoms. After my diagnosis, his nerves were on the verge of extreme weakness. If he had not committed severe masturbation in his youth, the vas deferens and seminal colliculus would not have been so relaxed. When asked, it was true. He also said that he got married in his hometown four years ago. After the honeymoon, his weak body was unbearable. After one or two months, he suffered from premature ejaculation, and then severe kidney deficiency. So he came to Shanghai to change his environment. He had taken many kinds of medicines, but unexpectedly, the function of the reproductive glands became more and more decadent. Then he was introduced by his friend Xu Hesheng to come to my clinic for treatment. I thought that I must transform his hormone function, so I mainly used "Bu Ti Kang", because this is a hormone preparation made from brave animals such as sea dogs, and it has a great effect on neurasthenia and spermatorrhea due to insufficient Dutch hormone. Sure enough, Mr. Zheng felt strong and energetic after taking less than three boxes. Then he continued to take "Bu Ti Kang" and also took "Yu Jing Pian" to further consolidate the spermatorrhea and completely solve his spermatorrhea. After taking about half a dozen, all the symptoms of weakness were completely cured. Not only did his complexion become rosy, but his weight also increased sharply. Recently, his wife also came to Shanghai from her hometown to spend a happy life together.</p>

<p>— Dr. Chen Zongkun, Medical University of the Japanese Empire</p>
<p>Patient Tian Rixin, from Liaoning, took refuge in Shanghai after the September 18th Incident and lived on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Last year, he contracted gonorrhea. Mr. Tian Zishi likes to drink and move, which suddenly turned into orchitis, with swollen and painful testicles. After the ulceration, the upper, lower and three sides were convex in a round shape (as shown in Figure A). This disease tended to suppurate due to Mr. Tian's prolonged and untreated condition. Once it suppurated, this testicle would have the bad result of infertility. In addition to ordering him to be absolutely quiet and using a testicle support belt, he was ordered to buy "Keling Nong", a medicine invented by Germans, from various pharmacies to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, resist gonorrhea, and relieve his pain. Two weeks later, the disease had improved, and the swelling and pain had been reduced by 60 to 70%. The crisis of suppuration could be avoided. He was still ordered to take the previous medicine. After taking "Keling Nong" for about four weeks, the swelling and pain in the testicles disappeared completely, and they returned to their original healthy state (as shown in Figure B). Others such as clear urine, microscopic examination, also without gonorrhea. It is sufficient to prove that Mr. Tian's disease has been cured by "Keling Nong". Even now, drinking and labor have no abnormal changes in the disease.</p>

<p>The principle of preventing tuberculosis is to dissolve phlegm first. Acidic drugs can kill bacteria but can congeal phlegm, which makes the tuberculosis bacteria use phlegm as a barrier.</p>
<p>People with unhealthy lungs are easily invaded by tuberculosis bacteria. Once invaded, the lesions are formed. If people who usually have a lot of phlegm or know that their lungs are weak take this special medicine to nourish the lungs, there will be no other places. Otherwise, once the lesions are formed, they will gradually expand, spreading to unmanageable levels through blood circulation and lymphatic flow, which is worrying! Because the outer skin of tuberculosis bacteria is coated with wax and is resistant to acid, most drugs on the market use extremely strong acidity to suppress the bacteria's resistance. In fact, this kind of hegemonic medicine only kills innocent people, and cannot harm the tuberculosis bacteria in the slightest. Because acidic substances can best solidify phlegm, to kill bacteria, you must first dissolve phlegm. Otherwise, there is no way to deal with the bacteria in the phlegm. Dr. Tu Mei spent 30 years of research and investigation on the nature of tuberculosis bacteria and invented the special medicine to nourish the lungs, "Bu Fei Na Er". He absolutely avoided hegemony and adopted a combination of suppression and appeasement methods, so it is extremely effective for eliminating tuberculosis and antibacterial, and treating hemoptysis, coughing up phlegm, tidal fever, night sweats, reduced appetite, chest pain, coughing, and emaciation! Because it is good at removing phlegm, it is effective for long-term cough, excessive phlegm, cold cough, infantile whooping cough, and senile asthma. If you have tuberculosis and also have brain weakness, insomnia, palpitations, forgetfulness, women's menstrual disorders, men's kidney failure, premature ejaculation, etc., you can also take "Bu Nu Rong" for women or "Bu Ti Kang" for men to regulate menstruation, nourish blood, nourish the kidneys, and promote essence, so as to improve brain health, cultivate weakness, and greatly increase vitality. It is effective in five weeks to eight or nine weeks. (If men have spermatorrhea, spermatorrhea, they can also take "Yu Jing Pian"!)</p>

<p>Etiological Therapy</p>
<p>Loss of appetite, fear of rice, are all harbingers of stomach disease. Delaying treatment will expand the disease: frequent vomiting, belching with sourness and bitterness, chest tightness and pain, yellow face and thin muscles. My clinical experiment, in addition to using "One Qiang Wei Jing" as a symptomatic treatment, also takes into account the etiological treatment: for example, for anorexia and chest tightness caused by lung disease, I also instruct to take "Bu Fei Na Er" to resist and eliminate tuberculosis bacteria. For stomach fatigue and constipation caused by smoking addiction, you can also take "Bu Ti Kang" to help quit smoking. In addition, "Qiang Wei Jing" is good at treating constipation, flatulence, and beriberi caused by indigestion. Xianshi, Wing On, New New Company's western medicine department and various pharmacies sell it.</p>

<p>Why does the pain of losing pleasure occur?</p>
<p>In general, both men and women are inevitably addicted to self-pleasure (masturbation) during their youth development period. This bad habit not only has a great hindrance to physical health, but also has a great damage to the sexual nerves. Often, the lower part is underdeveloped, like a child who has not yet reached adulthood, and diseases such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and weak erection also follow. Especially during proper sexual intercourse, the pleasure is often lost due to the weakness and numbness of the sexual nerves, which is the greatest pain for ordinary young people.</p>
<p>Patients often feel mentally exhausted, pale, and have pale lips and nails, as if they have lost blood. In fact, this is all caused by anemia with blood circulation disorders caused by masturbation. Dizziness, distress in the heart, insomnia, women have menstrual disorders, and underdeveloped breasts and buttocks, chlorosis, etc., are all the results of this kind of masturbation. Not only does the pleasure disappear, but also problems with offspring occur.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiong, who lives on Shanxi Road, is 27 years old. He had a very good development in his youth, but later he was seduced by bad friends and committed bad habits. He committed them day by day, and the sex glands were gradually damaged, so that normal sexual intercourse after marriage also lacked pleasure, and there were also nocturnal emission, insomnia, and other symptoms. He has been married for five years and has never been pregnant. He has taken medicines to replenish the kidneys and consolidate essence, but they are not very effective. Later, he changed to my clinic for treatment. After examination, it was found that the sexual nerves had been very weak. He was instructed to take a large amount of "Bu Ti Kang" to replenish the brain and produce essence, strengthen the reproductive system tissues, and restore the function of the sexual nerves. Mr. Zhou followed my instructions and went to various pharmacies to buy "Bu Ti Kang" for one to five weeks, and he got full effect. The pleasure was restored, just like before the illness. For women who suffer from this, you can take "Bu Nu Rong".</p>

As for premature ejaculation after marriage, spring dreams are hard to find, affecting the relationship between husband and wife, and sexual underdevelopment, you can also take "Bu Ti Kang" from Wing On to strengthen vitality, enhance hormones, and it will be cured in about four or five bottles.</p>

<p>In recent European and American medical circles, according to the latest antigen therapy, a kind of "anti-gonorrhea serum" with strong antibacterial effect has been invented. Once used, gonorrhea can be completely eradicated. It is rare for countries around the world to adopt this therapy, and it has never been heard of in China. Dr. Yao Juyan, a well-known expert in gonorrhea in Shanghai, did not hesitate to spend a lot of money to purchase this anti-gonorrhea serum. He specializes in treating various acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, and chronic and recurrent old leucorrhea - such as prostatitis. Orchitis, arthritis, etc. and other complications. According to the statistics in June of this year, more than 1,000 people treated by him have had good results. Occasionally, one or two people have not been cured because they drink, gamble, and overwork during the treatment period. If they can follow Dr. Yao's instructions, they will all be cured.</p>

<h3 id="e177">Funeral Before Death <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>In South Carolina, USA, there is a 73-year-old woman named Fen Duo Peike who recently suffered from a serious illness and was dying. She knew that she had no hope of survival, so she asked to hold her funeral early before her death so that she could truly receive it. At the time of the funeral, the old lady also made a short speech, expressing her deep gratitude to all the relatives and friends at the Mecca funeral. Three days after the funeral, she died. Such a funeral is unheard of, but I say this old lady is really interesting.</p>
<p>No one can escape the moment of life and death. As for being dead, you are completely unaware. No matter how sad, how memorialized, or how grand the ceremony is for your children, grandchildren, relatives and friends, it has nothing to do with the deceased. Therefore, the most sensational funeral of Sheng Xingcun in Shanghai in the past can be called the most grand of the time. However, at that time, someone said that if Sheng Xingcun was sitting on the coffin, or sitting in another carriage (there were no cars at that time) and walking in the middle of the road, it would be a great victory. If the person is dead, this kind of action is originally empty, and you can only see banknotes flying all over the road.</p>
<p>Originally, holding a big funeral and a big memorial service was something that the descendants did for others to see, not a truly filial act for the deceased. This kind of action originally has three functions: one is to show how filial the descendants are to their parents and ancestors, one is to show how阔绰 the descendants are, and one is to show how much wealth the descendants have. The extravagant funeral is extremely luxurious, and the result is nothing more than this, which has nothing to do with the deceased.</p>
<p>Usually, no matter how unfilial or disobedient you are, if your parents die, there will definitely be sentences such as "not dying by yourself, causing misfortune to a certain relative" and "wearing mourning clothes and being confused, crying incoherently" in the public announcement to relatives and friends. This old lady saw through this point and insisted on enjoying it before she died, not after she died. Such a thorough method is indeed rare. Her intention is that if you want to be a filial son, show it to me before I die, not to others after I die. If you want to fulfill the friendship of relatives and friends, you should also show it to me before I die, not to others after I die. This old lady is really reasonable.</p>
<p>But I say that although this method is good, it is never a good idea to have a funeral before you die. You will also feel embarrassed. In my opinion, it is better to celebrate your birthday than to have a funeral. I think this old lady must have forgotten the method of celebrating her birthday when she was seventy-six or seventy years old. Assuming that she celebrates her birthday, she can still let her descendants do their filial piety, let the guests be full, and sit in the middle and receive people's congratulatory gifts. Isn't this more interesting than having a big funeral?</p>

<p>— Makino</p>
<p>"Oh, what a feud, what terrible hatred is this? Beating like that! Listen... Oh... Heavens, what a sin, aren't they husband and wife? ... What on earth is it all about?... Like this..."</p>
<p>Old Peterovna cried out, as she hurriedly ran down the three flights of stairs, she ran to</p>
<p>..., Have you all seen it? The couple were twisting together desperately, looking just like two dogs fighting... Like that..." Peterovna shouted hoarsely to everyone, her eyes wide, she constantly lowered her head sharply, peering at everyone from the edge of her old glasses with a faint gaze, as if searching for someone; her hands trembled violently in front of her chest from excessive stimulation, sometimes tightly clutching her clothes, tearing at them; her face was pale, "...Beating like that... Oh... What a sin, I tried to persuade them but failed, instead adding fuel to the fire... That drunken Bashkin grabbed Alina's beautiful hair tightly with one hand... Like this... Like this... His other hand was clenched into a terrible fist, pounding her back again and again... Like drumming! Oh!... Poor Alina, she was hitting him, but... she was so weak!... She didn't inflict any pain on the brutal Bashkin at all!... You... Listen!... This is... this..."</p>
<p>Then everyone followed Peterovna's gaze, focusing on the windows on the third floor, but what could they see? They only heard the thudding of fists on flesh, and the sounds of messy and heavy footsteps, everyone looked up nervously, some also poked their heads out onto the balcony. Here, Peterovna swept past everyone like a whirlwind, and then she hurriedly ran back to the small building.</p>
<p>Before long, Peterovna ran down again, her face full of joy, she said: "Oh!... Merciful God!... God has given them happiness - they are reconciled again!..." Saying this, she made the sign of the cross on her chest.</p>
<p>What an interesting old Russian woman!</p>
<p>Since I had just moved into Shuocun, I was particularly interested in these Russians who were previously unfamiliar to me. I used to observe them carefully in my spare time. Their faces unique to Russians, their strange noses, some women still wearing half-old red and green clothes... all of this gave me new stimulation. Decades ago, weren't they all noble royalty? Their royal dignity has also been shattered.</p>
<p>Later, gradually, I became friends with the kind old woman Peterovna. One day, I asked about the Bashkin couple, and she began to chatter endlessly like all old women:</p>
<p>"Oh!... What a sin, it's really impossible to say, this... I don't know how God listened to the devil and drove us out of the land of Russia, handing everything over to the crude workers, foolish farmers, and all the low-class things... Oh!</p>
<p>You know, we are all royalty, relatives of Saint Nicholas, we used to not have to do anything, not even walk... but now, we have to make a living for ourselves! This is a torture for us... How is that possible!...</p>
<p>Bashkin, poor Bashkin couple!... He never had a job, and when he ran out of the money left by his old mother, he fell into poverty forever!... God gave him a violent personality. Drinking, gambling wildly... and an arrogance that shouldn't have existed anymore, oh! This poor young man!</p>
<p>I don't know from what day they started losing breakfast... Later, sometimes they couldn't get anything to eat all day, not even a small slice of black bread! Bashkin would go crazy and beat his wife Alina... Like that, he was as if fighting her! What was going on?</p>
<p>Borrowing money was unsuccessful, no one would give them any help!</p>
<p>One night, Bashkin didn't come back. When I went to the balcony to cool off, a man's laughter filled his room! What a sin, I... Please God forgive me, I peeked through the keyhole like that, ah!... A, a strange man was hugging the beautiful Alina!... God knows, what were they doing! ... Later... Later, strange men often slept with Alina... Poor Bashkin sometimes spent an entire night alone on the lonely streets... Alina was happy to do that! Sometimes she cried in shame... The sinful Bashkin even drank up the money that was hard to come by.</p>
<p>Oh... They fought almost every few days, that was when Alina's hard-earned money was used up by him!..."</p>
<p>But, after a while, the beautiful Alina disappeared, and naturally there were no more fights! Later, I heard Peterovna say: "She was probably sold by him!"</p>
<h3 id="e179">Filial Son Afu <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiuyang</p>
<p>After a rain, swarms of dragonflies circled in the sky, the neighbor's children used cattail fans tied to the ends of bamboo poles, fighting back and forth to catch them, so I thought of Afu, the farmhand in my family.</p>
<p>Afu had special skills in catching dragonflies. After he caught them, he tied their heads with yarn, always a string of more than a dozen, because they restrained each other, they looked very beautiful when they flew. Afu has always been unforgettable in my mind, probably for this reason.</p>
<p>He was forthright, strong, and never lazy. In addition to the work in the fields, he was willing to grow vegetables and carry water, and we didn't have to take care of him. From the time he got up to the time he went to bed every day, he liked to drink a few mouthfuls of wheat wine in the corner of the threshing ground at dusk, and he never rested. I remember one year during the New Year, when settling wages, my grandfather told him with a smile.</p>
<p>"Afu, you already have more than thirty yuan now. I'll help you make it forty yuan and put it in interest. In the future, when you marry a wife, you can have a good family."</p>
<p>Afu thanked him with his head down, and then said his wish in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Sir, how much does a piece of land for a grave cost? My father hasn't been buried yet."</p>
<p>From then on, the filial son Afu became famous in the town. But his companions often joked with him:</p>
<p>"Afu, working hard as a farmhand, not marrying a wife for enjoyment, but buying a grave for your father, you're really a good boy."</p>
<p>Saying this, he patted Afu's strong back, as if an old man loved his son.</p>
<p>"Afu, marrying a wife is also being a filial son, did you hear the master (private tutor) say? Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is having no descendants." Another companion proudly recited two refined lines, circling his head, still afraid that Afu didn't understand, explaining: "Your father raised you, and you should also raise a son to pass on the lineage. Understand? That's being a filial son."</p>
<p>That companion even made obscene gestures with his fingers.</p>
<p>Afu sat cross-legged in the corner of the threshing ground like a Maitreya, holding a small bottle of wheat wine in his hand, drinking mouth to mouth, while taking out broad beans from his pocket to peel and eat. Hearing his companions teasing him, he spat out a mouthful of phlegm.</p>
<p>"Shameless!" Afu said to that companion, "Wife, wife, might as well hug a pillow for fun at night!"</p>
<p>In the cotton fields and by the riverbanks, young men often flirted with girls, the four-line hill songs (country love songs) were sung loudly to each other, a kind of instinctive desire in the countryside was thoroughly unreserved. But Afu always pretended to be serious and never said a joke to the girls.</p>
<p>Grandfather secretly promised Afu a wish, he saved up his wages to buy a grave to bury his father, grandfather prepared to pay attention to a good girl to help him make a family. But unfortunately, in the vortex of the Great Revolution, my family was robbed, the houses were set on fire by local gangsters, and grandfather failed to escape and died. After the chaos subsided, my family's land changed its surname, and naturally they couldn't afford to hire a farmhand. When Afu went to the city to find work, he said to my father;</p>
<p>"When the young master farms in the future, Afu will still come to be a farmhand."</p>
<p>Father could only smile bitterly. Afu was already like family in our house, and I was even more reluctant to see him leave suddenly. Father finally gave him some pocket money, and said sadly:</p>
<p>"Afu, the thing the old master promised you can only be in vain, you should go to the city to find a master, and you'll have to marry a wife in the future."</p>
<p>Afu didn't spend a year in the city before news came that he had married a widow, and was tricked by a matchmaker out of the hard-earned money he had saved up to buy a grave to bury his father. Father sighed when he heard this and said, "The city is not a good place!"</p>
<p>That matter has been twenty years ago now. Last year, a letter came from home saying that Afu had returned to the town again. He had completely changed his appearance. Twenty years of life's oppression had completely changed him. He often borrowed money from his father by force, or stole things to buy wine to drink. In August, when picking cotton, he raped a little girl in the field and was tied up by the town and sent to the city, where he was sentenced to twelve years in prison.</p>
<p>A filial son Afu who hated women, finally committed rape and was imprisoned. I can never figure out the contradictory cause of his crime. I want to have a chance to go back to my hometown to see him once.</p>
<h3 id="e180">A Soldier Selling a Watch <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>In the afternoon of June, the sun exploded in the sky like a bomb, the stone road evaporated with a scorched smell. This is a narrow street in a corner of a big city.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, with three or five rickshaws passing by to hand over shifts at the rickshaw depot, and a group of children naked from the waist up running around in the street, embellishing the desolate market.</p>
<p>The only big shop on this street is Sun Erpangzi's butcher shop. He habitually closes the market after noon. In fact, no customer comes to his shop in the afternoon to do business worth three or five hundred copper coins. He put his old rattan chair under the eaves and slept his afternoon nap with his black-haired chest open.</p>
<p>The busiest business is Zhu Houzi's tobacco shop, where three copper coins buy kerosene, and a box of incense matches can be exchanged for two cigarettes. From the opening of the market in the morning to the closing of the gate, there are always customers coming and going in front of his shop. The author specially writes about these two shops because they are the most outstanding facades on this narrow street. In addition, they are all sloping low houses, and when people with relatively tall statures pass by, their heads are suspended on the roof.</p>
<p>But Zhu Houzi always envies Sun Erpangzi for having good luck, only doing business for a few hours in the morning, and then sleeping soundly in the afternoon, while he jumps up and down in the shop like his name. He makes a circle with his fingers - fifteen o'clock. The afternoon should be relatively idle, but he can't take a nap at the counter, or leave the shop for a few minutes. This excellent tobacco shop has not hired even a basic shop assistant.</p>
<p>Isn't there a customer coming now? It is a middle-aged soldier wearing a sauce-colored tattered military uniform. He dropped a copper coin and bought two cigarettes "produced by our shop". He seems to have not smoked cigarettes for several days, and burned most of a cigarette in one breath as soon as he lit it, but no trace of green smoke came out of his nostrils; with another mouthful, a cigarette had already burned his fingers. He glanced at Zhu Houzi, barely making a smile, but no one knew the reason for his smile.</p>
<p>"Boss," he finally opened his mouth: "Do you want to buy something?"</p>
<p>Zhu Houzi looked at him. He was surprised that the soldier might be a mental patient, and he was also wary that he would suddenly jump over the counter and rob something. Zhu Houzi had that kind of experience. But no, he surveyed the street for a week and took out a gold watch from his waistband and placed it on the counter.</p>
<p>"Boss, I don't have any money to use. I have to sell this watch cheaply."</p>
<p>Zhu Houzi's eyeballs were rolling in his eye sockets. He knew what "kind of person" the soldier was. He snatched the watch over and listened to it by his ear. The sound was very loud, and the outer shell was shining with gold color under the sunlight. Zhu Houzi knew that even if it wasn't gold, it was a good watch.</p>
<p>"How much do you want to sell it for?" His tone was like a pawnbroker.</p>
<p>"Boss, how much money do you want to give me?" The soldier smiled reluctantly again? "I haven't smoked for two days!"</p>
<p>Seeing that the boss was staying put as if he didn't understand his words, he immediately added:</p>
<p>"I haven't smoked opium for two days!"</p>
<p>Zhu Houzi was really smiling in his heart. This unexpected deal was worth half a month's business, but he deliberately examined the watch, and then pried it open to inspect the internal parts, shaking his head:</p>
<p>"No way! The internal parts have all been moved." Like an expert, "I'll put six cents here."</p>
<p>At this time, that group of children suddenly saw the soldier, "A soldier," they shouted, slowly walking towards Zhu Houzi's shop, making him even more uneasy.</p>
<p>"Boss, add a little more, this watch can be pawned for two yuan. - Hehe, the boss is a smart man, just add a little more."</p>
<p>Zhu Houzi held the watch tightly in his hand. He was thinking about sending him away quickly. In any case, he wouldn't lose money at two yuan. The group of children would talk nonsense when they saw it. He turned around and picked out two banknotes from the locked silver box, and went back to the counter to give them to him, deliberately raising his voice:</p>
<p>"Hey, two cigarettes."</p>
<p>The soldier took the banknotes, hurriedly stuffed them into his pocket, and walked towards the center of the street.</p>
<p>Zhu Houzi closed the market early that day, and admired the gold watch under the lamp for a long time before wandering to Sun Erpangzi's shop to watch beating five hundred spades.</p>
<p>"Little Houzi is early today." Sun Er started to get up.</p>
<p>Zhu Houzi saw that the time had come, and he deliberately slowly took out the gold watch from his chest pocket. When he looked at the hour hand, it was still pointing at five o'clock. He immediately put it to his ear, but there was no sound at all. He shook it hard, and he only heard a few clicks like a dripping faucet and then stopped. Zhu Houzi was so anxious that his face turned red. Two banknotes were swaying in front of his eyes. He ran out of Sun Erpangzi's shop, wanting to chase the soldier who deserved to be beheaded back.</p>
<p>The street lamps were vaguely hanging on the telephone poles, and the children wearing around were gone. Zhu Houzi felt like he had fallen into an ice cellar. Two yuan, two yuan, he was almost crying.</p>

<p>Since the Swallow Society held its inaugural meeting at Xinghualou, it has expanded internally and divided into four groups: singing group, harmonica group, drama group, and Peking opera group. Currently, there are singing and harmonica groups broadcasting. The Central District practice location of the society has been set at Room 310, 3rd Floor, Taichang Building, North Zhejiang Road. The Central District practice time is Wednesday, Saturday, and Sunday, from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>The Moonlight Music Research Society's harmonica team has now expanded and is recruiting members. If you are interested in the harmonica and are determined to join the society, please send your address, name, and harmonica experience to Chen Tongfu, No. 24 Haige Lane, Haige Road.</p>
<p>The Times Art Society is now jointly organizing the Qingbai Drama Society and the Modern Society to form a drama group to broadcast "Remarriage".</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Loufen is now planning a new plan and needs a large number of female members and music team members (instruments are self-provided). Anyone who is of good character, has no hobbies, has received considerable education, and loves music and singing can apply. Address: No. 136 Ladu Road, Lafayette Road, French Concession.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Before Ma Loufen entered Yihua, this magazine had already published news that Ma Loufen was going to engage in broadcasting again. It was sent by his younger brother Ma Tinglong. The editor of course thought it was true and published it; but when Ma Loufen asked him if he was going to broadcast again, he replied that he didn't know anything about it. Now that Ma Loufen has officially encountered , I'm afraid he won't have any extra time to "plan a new plan," but this news was also sent by Ma Tinglong (although it was not signed, but the handwriting was the same as the previous one). I really don't know what kind of medicine is being sold in the gourd?</p>
<p>Movie</p>
<h3 id="e184">"The Wayward Lamb" Cast List <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>This year's blockbuster from Lianhua Film Company, Cai Chusheng's next masterpiece after "Song of the Fishermen," "The Wayward Lamb," is now premiering at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre in Shanghai. It has been in preparation for over a year, in production for a year, and cost tens of thousands of dollars. Its excellence and grand scale are unprecedented in Chinese films. Below is a description of the roles played by the more important actors in the film, as well as their characters' personalities, so that viewers may appreciate the touching plot and the greatness of the work.</p>
<p>Ge Zuozhi as Little Sanzi: A kind, poor village child, full of enthusiasm and a sense of justice. But like most Chinese, he suffers from timidity. In the village education that makes people more foolish, he becomes a mischievous child. Furthermore, due to the oppression of natural and man-made disasters, he becomes a wild street child. However, he still retains some of his kind nature, although he struggles daily in a miserable life.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan as Cuier: An uncultured wild girl from the countryside. On the surface, she is brave, impetuous, and willful, but her heart contains a passionate tenderness peculiar to women. She has the same experiences as Sanzi, but her environment has not changed her nature.</p>
<p>Li Zhuozhuo as Shen: An urban woman who worships so-called modern civilization, possessing a snake-like allure. In a material enjoyment and a certain unsatisfying environment, she constantly seeks new stimulation. Her life is decadent and contradictory.</p>
<p>Zheng Junli as the Old Servant: A passionate and nervous old servant, with so-called "loyalty and righteousness" and so-called "old-fashioned enthusiasm." Due to the circumstances of his life, his shortsightedness allows him to only touch the surface of facts, without the ability to make further criticisms. This creates his superficiality and contradictions, and ultimately disillusionment. His existence may or may not be, but he is a character assumed by the author to illustrate that the problem of "The Wayward Lamb" cannot be solved from a humanitarian standpoint, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Shen Baining as Shen Cihang: He is a so-called pragmatist and "outstanding talent." Because of his skillful manipulation, he has become revered as a "savior of all" in the metropolis. However, in reality, he is a "[?]." Despite his outward appearance of "nobility and solemnity," his private life is generally unbearable to hear about! A comical character with a dual personality.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhi as the Bodyguard: A watchdog kept by a certain type of person. In his memory, there is no justice, he has lost his soul, and he relies solely on cruelty to maintain his food and clothing. He is a typical figure who "helps the wicked to do evil."</p>
<p>Yin Xiucen as the Lunchbox Delivery Man: A pitiful wretch from the petty bourgeoisie, whose life is filled with gray and despised by the "upper class." But when he becomes a so-called nouveau riche by sheer chance, the "upper class" rush to befriend him as a "god of wealth"! He never wants to mention his "shabby" past, because he is no longer a "clumsy oaf" but has a "fortunate appearance"!</p>
<p>Qin Haiyou as the Naughty Boy: A standard figure created by poor rural education, naughty and cunning. He finds pleasure in destroying other people's actions. He has innate intelligence, but this intelligence has been led astray.</p>
<p>Wang Ganqing as Little Zui: A street urchin struggling on the brink of starvation. Every day, every hour, every moment, he has no food to eat. Every day, every hour, every moment, he wants to put the food he sees into his stomach. This habit sometimes gives him an advantage, and sometimes it causes him great losses. A chronic sufferer of habits of daily life.</p>
<p>Hong Jingling as the Village Teacher: The monkey king in the village temple, a pedantic teacher. The dryness of life makes him understand even more deeply the "clear instruction" that "a strict teacher produces good students." However, he often falls asleep due to old age, which inevitably leads to "closed ears and blocked vision," and he ends up beating the innocent. His "dignity" as a teacher is thus turned into an object of ridicule by cunning students.</p>
<p>Li Junqing as the Principal: A sanctimonious principal who regards himself as maintaining public morals. He is the executor of utilitarian education and a glorifier of special classes.</p>
<p>Liu Qiong as Ren Temeng: A so-called young gentleman in the metropolis, possessing all the conditions for pleasing the opposite sex. He is the object of pursuit by so-called modern ladies and a plaything they use to pass their idle time. Wen Rong as Little Sanzi's Father: A farmer struggling in a miserable life, hardworking and upright, but ignorant. In the end, under personal resistance, he perishes like a tiny worm.</p>
<p>Huang Yunzhen as the Noblewoman: A busybody so-called noblewoman, whose only instinct is to be opportunistic. Therefore, she sometimes forgets her original "status" in a loss of composure.</p>
