<p>自日偽軍隊佔我察哈爾六縣察省精華之區淪陷其半而綏遠邊境日趨危急近傳北平當局與日方磋商解决察北問題於六縣地方行政商有折衝辦法卽六縣縣長人選由蒙古政務委員會遺派再由察省政府正式委任此事能吾作如此解决尙成問題觀日本進取之趨勢於內蒙一帶必得一步進一步而目前欲其停止沿平綏路之邁進恐無其他和平方法可以濟事蓋日本顯有征服吾內蒙領土全部而向外蒙發展向蕪聯進攻之企圖察北之軍事行動其開端也</p>
<p>就察北六縣之地理形勢言之其地控制張庫公路扼中國與外蒙及蘇俄交通之咽喉張庫公路截斷中俄商務卽無法進行庫倫與北平之間無法交通張北南下卽可控制平綏鐵路而平綏鐵路實爲內蒙及察綏諸省命脈之所在日本之計畫不但使南滿鐵路與北寗路相接且圖北寗平綏之接軌使日本軍隊自大連來者旣可經南滿北寗平綏而直達內蒙又可由各路連接張庫公路陳兵於外蒙境界而威脅庫倫此種計劃設竟實現朝鮮與綏遠可以直達通車而內外蒙與綏晋陝冀諸地將無寗日矣</p>
<p>日本之圖內外蒙也原有具體之計畫沽源六縣之被佔爲此計畫之開始實行在土肥原輩之眼底所謂『蒙古國』之製造較『滿洲國』更爲重要蓋唯控制蒙古方可達到控制亞洲大陸之目的亞洲歷史所昭示者唯長城以北之勢力可以長久的控制中國也故滿洲偽國產生之時日人卽將滿洲境內之蒙古族劃爲一『興安自治省』予以相當之自治使成爲『蒙古國』計畫之基點興安省內有蒙人二三百萬其總數爲蒙古人口之半日人卽以呼倫（海拉爾）爲策動蒙古族脫離中國運動之根據地一方面威脅外蒙一方面引誘內蒙幸內蒙諸王公尙能判明孰友孰敵過去未墮入日人之陰謀外蒙恃蘇俄爲後援對於日滿之侵略雖一再讓步然頗有限度今日本旣伸手於察哈爾省不但百靈廟方面之政權危若纍卵庫淪方面亦如利劍在腹生命受危事態嚴重方之於九一八猶有過之</p>
<p>日本對付吾國之手段其最酷烈老厥爲在我國領土製造許多傀儡國直接由日本籍之官吏統治由日本軍隊佔據滿洲偽國已製造完成之愧儡也所謂「冀東反共政府」則第二愧儡之核心也日本不但無取消此偽組織之意且欲將冀察政委會併入而完成共所謂「華北國」之計畫內蒙方面日本亦以興安自治省爲核心製造又一擴大的傀儡組織蒙古政委會己爲日人欲奪爲己有之對象矣沽源六縣一失難返將來大漠以南不幸而淪爲滿洲第二此實嘴矢北方危機嚴重若斯國人其尙可因循坐視而不思亟起以圖挽救乎</p>

<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>當今世界的最大危機就在少數野心的國家要求着開拓邊界。因此邊界問題成為全世界最所關心的問題了。美國名記者勒克思。密勒氏最近撰有論文一篇，就道個問題，作客觀的寬泛人檢討。粗看雖也似乎帶些美帝國主義的氣味，可是那中心思想實在有着世界大同人倾向。原文載在基督敎科學導報，節釋如下。</p>
<p>美國社會經濟學者羅賓斯（Rasmond　Robins）曾經發表一篇演說，題曰「最後的邊界」。所謂「最後的邊界」他是指阿拉斯加與克郞大克而言。不錯，在美國大陸開拓的長久的史乘中，這二地當眞可以說是最後的邊界了。美國人一般地感覺到，這些邊界的决定造成了一個歷史的轉變點。從此，勇敢的開拓者不再想望把任何未經開闢的新地置在美國統治之下了。</p>
<p>差不多同時，恰在世界大戰以前，歐洲殖民國家對於非洲大陸的瓜分，除阿比西尼亞與利比亞以外，已告完成了。太平洋中的島嶼全數被列强佔奪了去，在亞洲大陸獲得新地也不再像以前一般容易了。大家感覺到政治邊界的開拓，碰到了逐漸增多的隙碍，勢必引起國家間的衝突來。果然，世界大戰就是因此造成的。</p>
<p>在今日，距離開拓邊界的可能性幾乎完盡的那一時期差不多已二十年了，而許多國家却仍然以可驚的速度開拓着邊界。這所謂邊界，不單是政治的，而且是經濟的和文化的。</p>
<p>最顯明的，而且最常被人想到的，乃是「政治的邊界」。日本已把牠的邊界開拓到滿洲以外，目前正在致力於把華北一大部分置在事實的統治之下。意大利已開拓牠的邊界到利比亞的更南部分，目前正在努力於把阿比西尼亞放進牠的殖民地疆域以內。這二者是以傳統的武力方法開拓邊界的顯著的例子。</p>
<p>比較不顯明的，是「戰略的邊界」的開拓。一九三四年冬季，鮑爾溫宣稱：英國將以萊茵河爲邊界。他說這話的時候，意思並不是英國將奪取比利時與荷蘭的領土與行政，却是因航空的發展，軍事方面發生了這麼巨大的變化，英國不再能以傳統的第一道防錢！英吉利海峽和北海中的艦隊！爲滿足，却須找尋更遠的根據地，而且準備着抗拒遠離國境的襲擊。</p>
<p>比政治的邊界和戰略的邊界格外不可捉模的，乃是「經濟的邊界」。在某一意義上，我們可以說：東方人購買一决福特汽車，美國的邊界就擴張一回。世界市塲原無異於一大戰塲，主要的企業競爭者都在這戰塲上，永遠期求着擴充他們的作戰範圍。這個經濟的邊界的擴張是這麼顯著，簡直可以說任何國家都被包括在任何其他國家的邊界以內。從美國人的餐桌上，就可以看出明白的證據來。古巴（糖），中國與日本（米，瓷器），愛爾蘭（蔴布），意大利與西班牙（橄欖油），荷屬印度（胡椒），墨西哥（嘩尼拉），哥斯德里加（香蕉），錫蘭（玉桂）阿拉伯與土耳其（棗子及無花果），及其他許多國家的經濟的邊界，可不是已經衝進美國人的餐室了嗎？</p>
<p>在這樣的情况中，邊界一直開拓着，勢必到了邊界實際不存在的時候纔停止。關稅的增高，固然造成妨碍商品交換的嚴重的壁壘，却不能阻止那决不可免的國際間的溝通。經濟的邊界的擴張，對於任何現代國家，是絕對必需的。那結果該不是衝突的，却是相互滿足的。</p>
<p>要是經濟的邊界開拓到國與國的邊界幾乎不能辨認了，那麼「文化的邊界」常然更加不容易辨認出來。對於語言與文字，關稅壁壘與檢查制度是絕對不能抵抗的。在波士頓短波電台播送的演說，可以給在美洲，歐洲，菲洲，亞洲的聽衆聽到。文字上的困難，是可以用翻譯來克服的。</p>
<p>比以前所知道更一致的文化，目前已廣泛地流行於地球的表面。歐洲人覺得歐洲正在變得亞美利加化。美國人覺得美國正在變得歐羅巴化。亞洲人和菲洲人正在採取西方文明，至少在物質方面。素來視西方化爲可怖的日本，目前已變成東方世界中最熱心的西方文明推進者。非洲的土民知道利用現代電影開末拉，而歐洲的藝術家則用原始民族的手工做他們作品的軌範。操英語者目前占有全世界人口百分之十一以上。</p>
<p>在自然科學的領域，近年來造成了可驚的邊界擴展。加里福尼州巴洛馬山上的新望遠鏡將無疑地顯示以前被認爲臆測的對象的宇宙。海底探險已發見了以前所未知的動物生活的式樣。航空飛機已衝上了以前所未到的高空。兩極地帶已成爲大胆的航空家和探險家的狩獵塲。</p>
<p>「道德的邊界」也大量擴張了。個人自由的尊重使幾乎使任何國家都廢除奴隸制度。存在於太陽下面的合法的奴隸制的最後壁壘已隨着最近阿比西尼亞皇帝的廢奴運動而崩潰了。人道主義與婦女地位的意識的進步已掃除了如印度寡婦殉身之類的許多陋習。對於歷史悠久的軍事制度的厭惡已促成了如和平法庭，國際聯盟及凱洛公的之類的建立。</p>
<p>邊界無限制地擴張着，終究會不成其爲邊界的。假如我們的目標是在獲得某一個領土或某一個市塲，結果當然是衝突。但是假如我們的目的是在關於全人類共同福利的一個無限制的頜域上面，那麼結果就不是衝突而是合作了。（譯自Lewis　Rex　Miller論文）</p>

<p>集中發行取銷暗記</p>
<p>各錢莊銀行、向有領用暗記券辦法、以大成現金及四成保證領用暗記券、或以十足現金領用暗記券、但由發行銀行貼還領券人四成之保證利息、約年息六厘至六厘半、領券期限二年至三年、自財政部於十一月四日佈吿中中交三銀行鈔票爲法幣後、各發行鈔票之銀行、除中中交三行外、爲浙江興業·四明·通商·中國實業·四行·　業·中國農業·農商·等銀行、以發行權已集中於發行準備管理委員會、限制再行增發、由財政部酌定期限、逐漸以中央鈔票換回、乃將暗記券辦法取消、</p>
<p>三行改爲領用法幣</p>
<p>錢業同業公會各錢莊領用暗記券、以中央銀行爲大宗·中國·交通·二銀行决之、其辦法爲以六成現金四成保證領用暗記券、業經公會主席何衷筱與中央銀行等商妥、對於領用暗記券、改爲領用法幣、辦法仍以現金六成保證四成領用法幣、並取消「回籠」辦法、期限爲二年、由錢業聯合準備庫領取、分發會員各錢莊領用、業已實行、至於銀行同業公會會員銀行、向中中交三銀行領用暗記券者、亦照上項領用法幣辦法辦理、</p>
<p>各荘反對取銷領券</p>
<p>非錢業同業公會之亨·利·貞·各錢荘領用暗記券、向以四行·通商·中國實業·等銀行爲大宗、其領用辦法、爲十足現金領用鈔票、由發行銀行貼還四成保證利息、自大陸等銀行取消暗記券辦法後、卽組織領券人聯合辦事處、依理力爭、除向大陸銀行在第一特區法院提起訴訟、並請杜月笙·唐壽民·陳光甫·俞佐廷·胡筆江·等援助、主持公道、認爲發行雖已集中於發行準備管理委員會、但各發行銀行所繳之準備、亦爲六成現金四成保證、故不應取銷領券辦法、至各莊領券總額、據悉達三千萬元以上、</p>
<p>經調停後商妥辦法</p>
<p>嗣經杜月笙·唐壽民·兪佐廷·等設法調解之後、通商銀行、對原訂之領用暗記券合同、在未滿期以前、繼續有效、惟以十一月三日截止已領用實在數額爲標準、其封存未領之額、卽予减除、中國實業等銀行、對去年應貼還四成保證之利息亦照付、今祇大陸（按大陸係領中南券）及東萊（按東萊係爲中央券）二銀行、尙未解決、現正由唐壽民胡筆江兩氏、設法調停、預料或可於各業總結束前解决云、</p>

<p>華東社云、財部於去年十一月四日實行通貨管理制度後、對於無限制買賣外匯、更見成效、頃者、中央銀行最近出版之金融週報二三兩期合刊中、更詳述自客歲倫敦銀價慘落後、中行維持外匯行市之經過甚詳、昨日日文報亦贊中行統制成效、足可遏北投機、華東社記者亟錄之如次、</p>
<p>外匯行市始終平穏</p>
<p>客歲年底、倫效銀價開始慘落後、上海人心、頗現不安、遠期外匯之需要陡增、匯價卽漸緊縮、後以國家銀行以一先令二便士三七五及二十九元半之賣價、無限制出售外匯、足見在英美所存外匯之充實、上海匯市、卽現鬆動、至週一日（十二月三十日）社會對於政府維持匯價之能力、益增信仰、於是外匯多頭、不得不以賤價出售、或掉期至二月份、週六日（一月四日）中央銀行宣佈掉期價格、仍爲三十二分之三便士、十六分之三美元、故各銀行與國家銀行掉期交易、爲數頗鉅、此國家銀行以固定買價而賣出外匯、藉以維持幣制之成效也、新年開市以來、此種趨勢、益加顯明、、英匯近期由一先令二便士四六八七五、長至一先令二便士半、而一先令二便士五三一二五、美雁由二十九元八七五至九三七五、實有節節放長、至等國家銀行所定之買價、國家銀行每週近期匯價至一先令二便士六二五、美匯至三十元之買價時、卽當無限制購進之也、按一週來外匯趨勢轉鬆之原因、除多頭不耐期待、紛紛脫手外、尙由於出口匯票之興旺、以及舊歷新年關係、國外應收匯欵特多、亦有以致之、但在一月十日、美匯較爲鬆硬、實際外市曾至三十元者、實由英美套價之驟長故也、據外電傳、英美匯價之低落、由於國際金融市塲、恐懼美國有再度貶値之謠言而起、但我國新幣制、對於外匯、旣定有一定此率、英美匯價之任何變化、自無影饗國家銀行在週杪以三十元之購價、盡量買進美匯、可以窺見政府統制外匯之一斑矣、前週杪、報載政府禁止外匯投機買賣之消息、其實政府對於外匯市塲、自二十三年九月八日起、卽有明令禁止非正當之買賣、今政府旣以釘住方法、統制外匯、其成功實勝於限制也、</p>
<p>日報亦賛統制成功</p>
<p>昨日日文報亦稱三行統制外匯成功、足以遏止投機、特節錄如下、統制成功、市塲異常閒散、去歲十一月初旬、上海金市猛騰、至一二一七元以來、一起一仆、漸呈跌落趨勢、及本年一月十五日降至一一三九元八角、十六日連掉期差額、亦不過一一五〇元、兩月之間、實跌七十元左右、國府實行新政策後、華商及投機家對於統制、深感不安、故努力購進、以致金市猛騰、不料政府方面統制、意外鞏固、加以舊正以前、又往掉期結算、因是金市反落七十元、至於匯市、亦賴政府銀行隨時調節、對英一先令二便士六二五、對美三十元、對日一〇四元之限度尙能始終維持、日前英美外匯、甚爲有利、市塲拋售美匯、而中行仍能維持、故以日來市塲閑散異常、加以舊歷年關、迫在眉睫、想最近將來、不致有大變動也、</p>

<p>下屆起每組球賽不得超過十隊　初級字林各杯賽規則均有修正　高級杯自下屆起可望恢復比賽</p>
<p>本埠西人足球聯合會、最近由書記司必克君通吿會員隊、對於該會各項規則、已於上月二十日舉行委員會時、加以愼重之討論、對下屆各會員之升級降級問題及會章聯賽杯賽各規則、均有修正、下屆起即照新規則施行、</p>
<p>限制隊數及升降問題　該會每屆結束時，對各組中成績最劣之兩隊、除甲組於下屆仍可加入原組競賽外、其他各組則須降級、而最優之兩隊、則可升入較高之一組中、同時下屆起每組競賽球隊不得超過十隊、而每組中不得有同名之兩隊參加比賽、</p>
<p>球季開始與執會組織　每屆足球季之開始、原定十月一日起至次年三月三十一日止、載明該會會章第十六條、該條現經委員會修正、於下屆起自每年九月最末星期六起至次年四月中第二星期六止、第十四條之執行委員會之組織法、修正為執行委員會組織、由西人足球會職員選擇委員會員四人及會員三人、英陸軍或英海軍一人、及裁判會一人組織之、並以五個委員為足法定人數、其中裁判會一人、係新近增添者、為原章程中所無、</p>
<p>乙組可選四輪流球員　聯賽規則第六條、現已修改為「凡參加聯賽之球隊有甲乙兩組者、必須從乙組中選擇「輪流球員」FloatingPlayers四人、註册於西聯會書記處、此四輪流球員、可在任何一組中參加比賽、毋須再經委員會准許、」該條原文為凡一球員在本季已於甲組中參加比賽三次以上者、除得委員特別允許外、即不能再入乙組比賽、現經修改後、可無此拘束、但此「輪流球員」四人、係從乙組中選出、故實際上甲組球員加入乙組作戰仍有限制、</p>
<p>參加杯賽之等級限制　西聯高級杯賽自一九二七年開始後、僅賽四屆、至一九三一年即遭停頓、迄今已四年、西聯會擬於下屆恢復、此次委員會對高級初級及字林三種杯賽規則、均加以修正、高級盃賽規則第二條、原為「未加入聯賽之西人足球會會員均得加入、」現修正為「高級杯賽、祗准甲組球隊參加比賽以淘汰制决勝、」初級杯規則第二條、原「祗准丁戊兩組球隊及未加入聯賽之西人足球會會員參加、」字林杯規則第一條、亦將「除甲組球隊外均可參加」之原文、修正為「祗准乙丙兩組球隊參加比賽、」同時在規則第二條中、「限制球員凡參加字林杯賽之球員、不准再參加初級杯賽、」該條原文、為「球員已參加甲組比賽三次以上者、即不能任意參加」云、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott　原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>可憐的乃德經此挫折，精神上受了永不平復的創傷。他覺得不但失去了他的合夥與庇護人，幷且是人格破產，在貿易場中從此喪失了他的身分，沒有人再能信任他的說話，不管它是口說的或是筆寫的，縱然他以最大的努力去自贖他過去的虛偽；牌子已經卸下，公司已經拆散，他已經是個倒了毀了的人。那個倉摩，——孩子們的華爾街（註）——已不再認識乃德的名字了。皺皮額角和她的幾個姊妹上勁啼着，彷彿要他的一眷顧，然而他終於不來，又好像眞同情於他的不幸似的，因為生下的蛋只見逐日减少，有幾個雞惱了，退入到韜摩所不能尋覓的新窠裏去。</p>
<p>乃德聽見了這個消息，說道：「他們相信我的；」雖然有幾個童子聽到了竟嗤之以鼻，可是乃德郤籍以自慰，因為當一個人潦倒的時候，便是一隻花斑老母雞的信任，也覺得是極可安慰的。</p>
<p>然而韜摩也沒找新的合夥，因為猜疑已經　入，他以前推心置腹的那種寗貼的情形已不復存在。內達表示願來合夥，然而他也謝絕了，言詞裏一種公正的態度顯得他確是具有義氣的人。他說道：</p>
<p>「也許會發見乃德是沒有拿錢的，那末我們可以再合夥起來。我想這是不會有的，然而我們得給他一個機會，把這個位置再多留出一些時候。」</p>

<h3 id="c180">英美婦女的異同 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>英國是素以整潔，有秩序，富有紳士丰度著名的。自然，這些美點，不能不歸功於婦女。英國婦女的善於治家，是歐洲各國之冠。在英國的各個家庭中，雖然是不怎麽富裕的，雖然是沒有傭婦給操持勞役的，也總是把家庭，收拾得整潔而有秩序。每天，丈夫出外工作，妻子便在家裏打掃拂拭，洗滌垢穢，治理餐膳。丈夫工畢回家，總能見到歡愉活潑的妻子，陪着用膳的。雖然這種善於治家的主婦，白天是那麼的操作，但晚上跟着丈夫出去散步，遊樂，或是參加宴會時，依然是放着一副高貴的神態。還有一層，英國的婦人，是很愛儲蓄的。雖然丈夫的收入，並不怎麼豐裕，伊們也必克勤克儉的撙節些錢備蓄。在未結婚時，儘有以職業自給的，但結婚之後，百分之九十以上，都在家庭中，為丈夫治理家政了。</p>
<p>美國，雖和英國是姊妹國，但美國婦女的生活，却和英國婦女，截然不同。美國婦女，是專愛享樂的。一般的美國婦女，最怕的，便是治家。經濟寬裕的，把拂拭洗滌等事，都委之於傭婦。經濟力不够雇傭婦的，索性住進公寓去，那麽，連食都可不用自備了。所以在美國的各家庭中，雖也保持着相當的整潔與秩序但普通都不是出之於主婦之手的。美國婦女，最講究的是社交。女子在交際塲中的活動力，是遠過於男子，所以丈夫們是無法强迫妻子　伏在家庭中的。而且丈夫也不能强迫着妻子，一道兒出去玩要的。婦女職業在美國，是比了在英國，發達得多。未結婚的婦女，都從事於職業，不用說了，就是已結婚的，大率也都依然在外面服務。美國婦女，不甚注意金錢的儲蓄。她們因為都是很重視職業，忽視家庭的，所以對於子女的撫養，也是認爲一件很麻煩的事。因此，節制生育一事，在英國，不怎麽為一般主婦所同情，但在美國，却勢力十分雄偉。因為一般的美國婦女，都以爲生育是職業生活與社交生活的大敵。</p>
<p>至於英美婦女的相同之點，也是有的。伊們對於國家，一樣的富於愛國心。對於社會，一樣的有同情心。對於婦女參政權，一樣的有進取心。對於學問，一樣的終生抱着硏究的態度。而愛好運動，也是英美婦女所具的共通性。</p>
<h3 id="c181">我們到底要不要家庭？ <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 陳學昭</p>
<p>一九三四年的蘇聯Pravoa報曾經鑒於這個日常生活問題的重要，提出「找尋蘇維埃家庭」這個問題向靑年們徵求意見。我們個人的私生活與社會之間應該怎樣的調和？這是一個嚴重的懸案。大部分的蘇維埃靑年的回答是：我們要家庭，我們要使我們個人的生活與社會和諧的家庭。</p>
<p>我的意思也是這樣。簡括說一句，我就引用科學家郞譯望Langevin在他的「個人與社會」裏說的話：「我們愈是參加羣衆事業，我們個人的生活也愈幸福。」這話再對也沒有。</p>
<p>這樣看來，現代中國普通人的生活，實在不能算是幸福，他們不歡喜合霉的娛樂，如話劇等，他們比較歡喜讀小說詩歌，一個人在花間月下，在房間的壁角落裏，細細的讀，細細的回味。他們歡喜抽鴉片，歡喜弄零食吃。如果新式一點的，他們上上跳舞塲，看看電影，交些朋友，此類所謂「客廳的先生太太，」今天講講這個朋友的戀愛事情，明天講講那個太太的情史，搬搬口舌，吵吵架，今天與這個好，明天與那個不好，他們雖然極力要使他們的私人生活熱閙一點，但是在他們這個小圈子內七翻八變，依然還是貧弱；他們感嘆人生的空虛與無聊，他們要追求過去的歷史上的榮華，而忘了他們自己正是造成歷史之人呢，這個事情，他們反而不做。如他們這類的生活格式？太偏於個人，太遠離了社會，他們像把自己的門一樣的關了起來，自然嘗不到合理的幸福了。反過來說，合理的幸福，需要把個人與社會之間調和，把我個人不間斷的加進社會的動作裏去；同時對於任何正當的事要有濃郁的興趣，絕大的樂觀態度。</p>
<h3 id="c182">瑞典的離婚中裁制度 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 不忍</p>
<p>誰也不能否認：隨着女權運動的抬頭，離婚的手續變得逐漸容易，離婚的案件也就逐漸增多了。對於離婚輕易的利弊，論者的意見頗不一致，有的以為離婚應絕對自由，有的主張離婚的限制應愈嚴愈好。從事實上說，離婚後雙方獲得滿意的幸福的固然很多，但因一時意氣而草率離婚致貽後悔的亦不在少數。要之，在婦女經濟地位不能完全獨立的國家，欲求離婚制度之毫無弊害與離婚裁判之至公無私是萬萬辦不到的。近來頗有人主張，在離婚案件涉訟法庭以前，另設處理機關從事審查與勸解，藉以减少可以挽回的不幸事件，因為一到不合意的夫妻相見法庭的時候，雙方極盡攻擊的能事，法官全以法律條欵為根據，事情就到了無可挽回的地步了。在以女權運動先進著稱的瑞典，當局者已首先實行此項主張了。這就是瑞典的離婚仲裁制度。</p>
<p>在瑞典，要求離婚的常事人，無論出於片面或雙方同意，都須向離婚仲裁委員會申請。仲裁委員凡二人，二女一男，由司法常局委任。仲裁委員會接到離婚申請書後，即從事調查，詢問，勸解。如認為完全符合離婚法律條件而雙方又堅執不願復合者，委員會纔判令暫行分居。分居以一年為期，期滿後再給予正式離婚證書。據統計，在一百對請求離婚的當事人中，因委員會的努力調解而打斷離婚的念頭的達二十五對以上，在暫時分居期中雙方諒解而　修舊好的達三十對以上。這就是說，因離婚仲裁制度的設立，瑞典的離婚案件成事實的减少了一半以上。</p>
<p>勃蘭丁夫人是瑞典離婚仲裁委員會三委員之一。渠係曾任瑞典首相三年之勃蘭丁的女兒，為瑞典法律救濟會之創辦人，在首都執行律務，頗著盛名。新近勃蘭丁夫人赴紐的演講，嘗語人云：「婦女離開家庭的逐漸增多了；余不信這是她們願意這樣做，這實在是經濟的規律逼迫她們走這條路的。余相信男女共處是普遍的理想，但這理想必須以相互愛戀與諒解為基礎而非立於經濟的基礎的。」</p>
<p>觀這言詞，我們可以想見勃蘭丁夫人是一位怎樣關心家庭幸福的女人。她的被選爲與全國家庭幸福有關的離婚仲裁委員，當然不是偶然的啦。</p>

<h3 id="c183">劉王立明訪問記 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>滬江大學校長劉湛恩夫人王立明，大家知道她是女界中傑出的人材，她曾留學美國，擅長口材，有聲於時。歸國以後，為婦女界服務，已有十五年之久。她向來主張中國社會，需要新賢妻良母，頗為一般火所稱道。昨天薄暮，我在中華婦女節制會，和她作十分鐘的談話，覺得很有價値，現在忠實的報告於讀者。</p>
<h3 id="c184">劉王立明近影 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>「劉夫人在學生時代，那一伴事最値得回憶？」這是我第一句問話。</p>
<p>她想了一想，很高興的說：「値得回憶的事很多，一時說不盡，先舉個例吧，當一九一八年的時候，我正在美國西北大學讀書，校中舉行演說競賽會，各級都有代表，而且各國人都有，惟獨中國人不參加，我很生氣，不敢自餒，許多中國女同學都勸我不要獻醜，因為前二年曾有某中國學生名落孫山，太家以為太不名譽，我堅决地想出口氣，終於得了第三名。翌年又舉行，我早為準備，結果倖獲第一於是我們的同學，認為非常榮譽。同年女靑年會開夏令會於Late　Genava，晚上各國都有女代表演說，照例是不鼓掌的，我代表東亞，也說了一大篇話，剛下台，全塲掌聲忽起，並且把我高舉起來，爭相接吻，總算替中國女子揚眉吐氣，允其在塲的同胞，覺得十分開懷。這幾樁事並非自吹自擂，是表示一個女子，當仁不讓，臨事要有胆量，處處顧到國家的體面，長首畏尾，必致萬事無成。」</p>
<p>「劉夫人做主婦的生活怎樣？」</p>
<p>「我於一九二〇年回國後，卽在中華婦女節制會服務，一九二六年，本會改組，被推為總幹事，以迄於今。我出嫁那年，是一九二二年，本來我在會全日工作，因產後家事較忙，改為上午處理家政，下午到會辦公。我以為做母親是最偉大，最苦最難的工作，比做旁的事情不同。譬如說兒童的撫育，衛生，管理，看護，種種，做母親的人，都要能說能做，不但如此，還有家庭的經濟，烹飪，縫紉，輔助丈夫的事業，一切的一切，都屬於家政範圍以內，比敎貿敎一兩門功課，或是任何職業，因難得多呢。所以我主張新賢妻良母，不能放棄家庭的責任，卽使有餘力為社會服務，在生產之後，必須重新分配時間，要是把家政委諸婢僕，那是絕大的損失。我的理想，將來社會制度改革後，要打破婢僕制度，自己的家庭自己管，自己的兒童自己養；甚至衣食也自己照顧，這才是合理。」</p>
<h3 id="c185">父母子女合影 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>「劉夫人平日怎樣娛樂？」</p>
<p>「我也沒有什麽娛樂，只是在休閑時跟小孩兒一起玩，我有兩男一女，很够玩了，他們要打球就打球，要游戲就游戲：這是我最喜歡的。有時和他們栽花，欣賞美麗的花草，每晚督促他們溫課兩小時，有時從事著作，這都是我的娛樂方法。」</p>
<p>「劉夫人對於都市女性有什麽批評？」</p>
<p>「我不願批評，不過他們有兩點通病：　什九女子都要出嫁，而嫁前却毫無準備，如家事敎育方面，大都茫無所知。　嫁後毫不團結，多數女子在校時熱心為公，而嫁後忽轉變態度，遇社會公益事業，絕不關心，而交際宴會塲中，盛裝艷服，如花如玉的紛紛活動：有空便打牌電影為樂，整天不看書，不閱報，小孩也不管；生在如此家庭的兒童，不是幸福，簡直是遭難！還不及貧家母子刻刻在抱的天倫之樂：這些可說是生活的墮落也是精神的墮落：我常說倘若一個女子在結婚以後，不能把家庭的管理科學化，生活合理化；陳設美術化；經濟節儉化；同時對社會沒有相當的認識，不盡公民的義務；救國的責任；那她就不算是時代的妻母。」</p>
<p>「那末劉夫人以為現代婦女應向那條路走？」這是我前後一句問話。「這話說起來很長，縮短地講，現代婦女除了治家以外，要有健全的人格，謀社會的進化；盡國民的天職；目前應做的工作，如廢妾，禁娼妓，救女丐，禁蓄婢，援助失業婦女……等，都是婦女本身的事，應該聯合起來，解除大衆的痛苦。總之救國救民，不僅是男子的責任，復興民族，需耍婦女來推進，此刻要說的話，盡在於此！」</p>
<p>小小說</p>
<h3 id="c186">一綫希望 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 豪吾</p>
<p>嬰孩的不安和啼哭，一天一天加劇起來！允其在那風雨孤燈的晚上；哭的聲音，也由嘹喨而變為嘶啞，而時斷時續，蒙在鼓裏的家人，一次替伊交換襁褓的時候，突然發現包紮臍帶的布條，已經脫離了原來的位置；臍帶斷端，潮濕地突出在臍眼外面。</p>
<p>相因而至的，便是產母的乳汁，因鴛嬰孩口部痙攣，不能順利地吸收到嬰孩的嘴裏。</p>
<p>家人惶惑着，老態龍鍾的穩婆，這纔來在嬰孩兩耳旁邊薰炙了一會，並且斷定了這是「無可救藥的鎖口驚」；但是術通鬼神（？）的女巫，經過一番做作之後，權威似地說：「病自會轉機—而且就在不久的將來。</p>
<p>一顆定心丸滾進了家人食道裏面：「那我們也可不要慌了吧！」</p>
<p>嬰孩活着，掙扎着！靑紫的皮膚，瘦骨支離的臉龐；不要吃，嗚嗚的啼，啼吧！努力地，小生命；因為就在！因為祇在你那微弱的啼聲裹，還孕育着一綫不絕如縷的希望。</p>
<h3 id="c187">到厨房裡去　家庭食單 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 顧儷雲</p>
<p>「三朝入廚下，洗手作羹湯；」妻女們對於烹飪，自是不能不加以硏究的。在這不景氣的年頭，先得在主持家務的時候，弄出吃包飯的笑話來。「回到廚房裹」並不是可恥事情，允其在這人窮世富的時代，我們更宜埋頭苦幹，凡事要親手幹去，自己煮飯來給自己吃！</p>
<p>烹飪；對於菜肴作料的支配，固然是一件大事，俗語說得好：「巧婦難為無米之炊，」然而調味的甜鹹，和火功的緩急，和煮菜都有重耍的關係；燒手好的，無論靑菜，豆腐，也會煮得津津有味，否則山珍海　，也變了味同嚼蠟，所以菜肴的火功和調味，在烹飪學上，很佔重要，</p>
<p>現在舉出下列幾味菜肴，煮法是各各不同的：</p>
<p>百寶野鴨　野鴨是太湖特產，蘇州冬天市面上，活的，都有出售，更有幾家煮熟野鴨出售的野味店，僅做冬春兩季的營業。可是那種煮熟的野鴨，僅可下酒和做粥菜，飯菜還是自煮為宜。野鴨白　，不及紅燒有味，在野鴨剖肚之後，在肚內塞些拌着碎猪肉或栗子等糯米進去，然後加作料紅燒，放在沙鍋裹，在炭火的風爐上　煮，香肥可口。</p>
<p>冬肉絲　先將薺菜擇淸洗凈，把肉和冬笋都切成細絲，然後起着油　煎炒。烹飪中凡是煎炒的菜肴，像炒蝦仁，炒肉絲等等，油　須燒得熱，火須用武火，燒得很旺，然後將蝦仁等放下，略略用剷刀幾炒，燒出得的蝦仁等菜肴，旣熟而嫩，十分鮮笋。假使油　一欠熱，那菜肴就不會鮮嫩，滋味就大不相同了。炒薺冬肉絲，當然也照上法煮的，肉絲下鍋後，即將薺菜冬笋放下，用武火煮着，略略一透，即行盛起，滋味是十分鮮美的。</p>
<p>蝦圓魚圓　在這暖鍋上桌的時候，蝦圓魚圓，也是家庭中必備的菜肴。蝦圓的煮法，是先將兩個葱白頭，和蝦仁一同搗爛，然後以蝦仁的多寡，加以二個三個鷄蛋黃，搗和以後，再加入些黃酒拌勻；然後煮一鑊沸水，將那蝦仁的肉泥，做成一個個的圓子，擲入水中。在蝦　擲入水中時，鑊底的火，祇須保住水的溫度，燒得如有如無，那麼蝦圓熟了，是嫩而鮮的，假使火力一猛，那麼蝦圓就老而無味了。做魚圓的方法，與蝦圓大致相同，不過刮魚膾，除去細骨的手續，有些麻煩，而拌入魚泥中的鷄蛋，也須用鷄蛋白，魚圓做成後，纔顆顆如水晶球里。</p>

<p>— 秦王茵玖</p>
<p>在放學後的一星期內，秋雲眞是忙够了，一切上美國去須備東西恨不得一口氣完全辦齊，甚至累得好幾夜不能睡覺。忽然有一天伊那表姊妹來了；表姊是一個已經結婚而且已有了一個兩歲的兒子的少年母親，平時和秋雲感情最好，伊丈夫在某一家大公司當着旅行查賬員的職務，時常出去，每逢他出去，表姊便得來招伊去同住。這决他又上福建去了，表姊便又來邀伊，伊很想不去，可是伊母親瞧伊忙得太累了，也希望伊能够暫時歇息歇，便竭力慫恿，秋雲這才允許了。</p>
<p>伊雖是很活潑，很大方，却從沒有和男性接近過，伊那哥哥的朋友們來家時，伊也祇淡淡的應酬幾句，懶得說話，有片面的情書投來，伊總是一拆開便撕掉的。這决伊到了表姊家去之後，發現表姊最近多了一種嗜好，便是打牌，理由很簡單，因為右而新搬來了一家沒一日不聽見牌聲的賭博世家。不過聚賭却無外人，祇是幾個內眷，於是表姊也給伊們拉了去。秋雲一去，表姊自然也要竭力拉攏，還說明這家人家除了兩個老頭兒之外，別無男人。秋雲不便固却，也隨去打了幾决牌。不料有一天牌桌上忽然來了一個衣服非常華美，舉北十分溫柔的少年男性，初說是給老太太代替的，後來就代長了，其時秋雲正敗得很厲害，這位先生恰巧坐在伊的上家，便盡力的帮助伊，每打一隻牌，無不是有益於秋雲；這已使秋雲很高興了，再加這人的說話又是特別的富於誘惑性，每說一句話，總能使人家同情。到終局時，他的影子已深深地嵌入秋雲的腦際了。從此，這人竟天天來和秋雲同局，誘惑的力量一天增大一天，以致使秋雲的聰明完全昏亂了，留學的準備，完全停頓，伊父親的督促，反給那男人造成了一個慫恿秋雲出奔的機會：</p>
<p>兩三年後，那男人又在當地出現了，並且還和另一個女人正式結了婚，而可憐的秋雲都不知飄零到何處去了，挾着伊的幸福一　和這世界脫離了關係。</p>
<p>標凖婦人</p>
<h3 id="c189">加里寧夫人 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 沈魚</p>
<p>加里寧夫人伊凡諾夫娜已經成為當代蘇聯的女英雄，伊的事蹟足可與伊的丈夫加里寧（蘇聯人民委員會的主席）相提並論，因為伊雖然身為主席的夫人，却立志做一僩獨立的女性，伊拿畢生的精力從事於西伯利亞山中那些不毛地之的拓荒</p>
<p>原來伊在四年以前，脫離了囂雜的莫斯科，抱著大無畏的精神，在遊牧的亞爾泰民族中建立了一個大農場，一個文化的中心。</p>
<p>伊一天到晚不空的忙着建設事業，開掘水池啦，建造電氣廠啦，養蜜蜂及其他家畜啦，訓練學童啦，總之，伊雖然巳是叫十歲光景的人，但却過着簡陋的生活，用全部精力放在亞爾泰的建設上面，所以現在那裏巳創立了供給全區糧食的大農場，灌輸文化的國家學校，兒童也都會識字念書了。</p>
<p>亞爾泰人從前是用火石取火的，現在也有新式的電燈了。</p>
<p>所以地方無論怎樣的荒蕪，只要有人能够犧牲一切的去努力拓荒，都能使那地方繁榮起來的，我們見到加里寧夫人的成功，不是得到一個很明顯的例證嗎？</p>
<p>像加里寧夫人這樣的女人，才値得讚揚，才可說是一個站立在時代前綫的女英雄呀！</p>

<h3 id="c190">迎胡漢民先生 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 方克</p>
<p>胡漢民先生從海外回來，現在已要抵香港了，据說不久，卽將專程北來，就任中當會主席。中央特派迎胡大員葉楚傖，居正，陳策諸公業已南下，上海各界所組織的「上海市各界歡迎胡主席展堂先生晋京任職籌備會」亦旣成立，都足為這决盛典的「序曲」。</p>
<p>上海迎胡籌備會，曾經有過一個議案曰：致函各報請于胡氏抵滬之日撰文歡迎，現在胡漢民先生雖尙未抵滬，而發表此文，似不免有過早之嫌，但及早歡迎，亦足見喁喁之誠，歡迎之切。</p>
<p>胡先生回國之日，適値民生凋敝，國難日亟之際，內則民生憔悴，災民遍野，外則國難之深，已由冀察問題一變而為綏東問題甚至山東問題，而學生愛國運動，又到處逢到碰壁的狀態，際此時間聞到胡漢民先生回國主持中樞的消息，眞是歡欣得撫膺鼓掌，莫可名言。</p>
<p>胡先生的受人擁戴歡迎，我們不僅從中央特派大員南下歡迎，及各地各界組織歡迎會各點可以見及，除此之外，各地從事愛國運動者對胡先生之期望之殷，及歡迎之誠，一定更十百倍於現有事實之表現，他們殷殷期望着：胡先生任職之日，卽中華民國國運旋乾轉坤之日，卽愛國運動受切實保障之日，卽實行革命外交之日，卽實行此决愛國運動者所提出之各項要求之日。</p>
<p>愛國運動應該受切實保障，言論出版集會結社絕對自由，厲行革命外交，……這些，這些都是載在中國國民黨黨綱，也卽是胡漢民先生平素所極力主張的，以前因為胡先生遠處異地交卸政權，他的主張未能貫澈實行，這决榮任中常會主席，秉政中樞，這些民衆所最低限度之要求，也卽胡先生平時所主張者，至望能够於就職之日，開始實現！</p>
<p>固然，我們所希望的最低限度的要求，並不是要求一紙通令，卽告完事，我們所敢要求者，是繼一紙通令之後，還繼之以實行。換一句話說，就是我們所要求者，並不是一紙支票，而是十十足足的兌現。</p>
<p>除此之外，全國工商業之如何救濟？災區民衆之如何急賑及防患？都是處茲水深火熱之民衆所熱望者，不過，這兩項雖然事屬同樣緊要，而下車之日，未必卽能功效立顯，不如保障愛國運動及言論出版集會結社之解禁等項，容易做到。</p>
<p>胡行生是革命的領袖，是青年的導師，對這些民衆的最低限度的要求，這此民族自救的最低要求，想必能極誠懇的表示接受，自屬毫無疑義，而我們所以曉曉不休者，則是要求胡先生於下車之日，卽有表示切實厲行民衆所要求的各條，以慰民望。</p>
<p>國難日亟的現在，民衆們是無暇，也不能再接受任何「支票」了的。</p>
<p>要的就是鐵一樣的事實！</p>
<h3 id="c191">搖櫓金發 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 夏天吾</p>
<p>在北虹沙住過一個時期，每天要到阿多爺的豆麥行裏去記行帳：從住處到豆麥行隔着一條浣紗浜，於是不得不每天作成搖櫓金發二次生意。</p>
<p>第一次認得搖櫓金發是春盡夏初的時節，因為我新到北虹沙，路徑不熟，是順升叔帶着我跨上搖櫓金發的渡船，順升叔拍拍金發的背指着我道：「這是阿多爺行裏新來的江先生，以後他每天要作成你二頓水烟錢哩！」</p>
<p>櫓搖金發是五十開外的人了，他聽了順升叔的話，在那稀疏的白鬍鬚的口邊拖了二條深痕的笑，他的臉容兒像很乾枯，背也有些曲，有時還帶着一二下沙啞的咳嗽，這情形眞顯露出他的衰老，可是使人不相信的，他一雙手却會那末靈活的搖着櫓，他的「搖櫓金發」的名號，大概就為這個呌上的了。</p>
<p>「你這搖櫓飯吃得很長遠了吧？」我問。</p>
<p>「呵呵！遠咧！遠咧！老爹手裏就傳下這條櫓，我也是從小就幹這話兒的。」</p>
<p>「你們的出息就靠在這兒嗎？」</p>
<p>「我們三代就喫在這河頭，楊家刷布金家渡，我們姓金的在前淸手裹在這渡頭上還立過貼呢！」</p>
<p>「那是挺好的進帳啦！」</p>
<p>「不算錯，老爹手裏，一個錢一張黃票，來回可搭四决，靠支櫓也曾傳給爺手裏一座五問堂，現在講銅角子了，一天擺上二三十决，在干凈天也有三四千文上帳，一家也含糊過得去了。」</p>
<p>說着，他稀疏的白鬍鬚的口邊又拖出了笑痕這笑痕裏含着他對于生活的滿足。渡頭邊到了，他挿起櫓，我們跨上岸，他打櫓回轉時，聽見他唱着：「頭蠶不看看二蠶，至麥不收划龍船……」的山歌。</p>
<p>因為每天在這渡頭經過，搖櫓金發白鬍鬚邊的笑痕和他那沙喉嚨裏的歌聲，在我的腦膜上留下了親切的印象，直到我離開了北虹沙，還很容易想起他。</p>
<p>去年端陽後幾時，因為阿多爹死了，我又要到北虹沙去一次，經過渡頭，搖櫓金發原在着，可是使我很奇怪，他的情態比以前不同了，他在衰老之中顯出了頹靡，他許久不見了我，至少白鬍鬚邊要展開一些笑痕，可是他的臉上一點也沒有歡容，我不覺隨意地問：「金發，今年虹沙的龍船有彩頭嗎？」</p>
<p>「那個還有心去閙龍船，到後去的日子要眼睜睜沒飯喫了。」</p>
<p>「為什末事？」</p>
<p>「江先生，你還不知道嗎？窮人的嘴惹不得口舌，我瞎了眼竟閙斷了自已的活命根了。幾天前東頭楊大爺的親家公到虹沙來，也到這浣紗浜擺渡，一上船，就直催着快搖快搖，巴不想一步踏上渡頭，我不識他，給一催惹開了嘴我說：「老先生，仗一支櫓，就只划得動一流二流水，你老先生要快，水上不能像路上好路步，你望着造了橋就好跨步了」不想這後一句話開了罪了，這位楊大爺的親家公回去竟就和楊大爺說合了，便在西橫頭那裏要蓋石橋了，你想這末一來，我的活命根不就斷了嗎？」</p>
<p>他說着，一面指着西橫頭給我看，我順着他的手指看去，果然看見西橫頭的田灘上堆着幾條又長又闊的橋面石。我說：「你在後來為什末不去呌楊大爺討個情呢？」</p>
<p>「唉！江先生，怎末不想到，我一得了信，就全家去求楊大爺，可是楊大爺說：「你求我也沒有用，我的親翁向來不受人氣的，何况是你，現在這件事，他早决定了主意，鄕公所裏也都贊成他呢！」……江先生，我這末一把年紀，不想竟遭了這塲橫禍，我這支老骨只能搖搖停停歇歇的櫓，別的幹什末喫飯呢？一家的活命根子不都絕了嗎？」</p>
<p>他的聲音迥盪在我耳邊，簡直使我沒勇氣回答他什末話，我也沒有同頭看他的臉便跨上波頭走了。</p>
<p>料理好了阿多爹的喪事出來，西橫頭的新石橋已經落成，我站在那渡頭看看，已不見了搖櫓金發和他那老舊的波船的影踪。我也只能走上那新石橋去，當我走在橋中對着浣紗浜的中流望望，好似搖櫓金發在渡船上眼中含着絕望與怨苦的淚水一瞬不瞬的看看我。</p>

<h3 id="c192">畸人 <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 葉萊</p>
<p>大天早，火船的機房透出來輕微的聲音和盪動，把我催醒過來的時候已到了虎門。這時，收票的人，一個高高的長臉的和一個挺着胸的胖子，他們已在我們的四等艙里嚴肅地出現了。我默默地望着他們那兩隻機警而靈敏的眼珠子，他們向着我們三四十個客人的臉上掃射着的時候，一個黃腫的臉的典型的北方人膽怯地望着他們，他們就喝着：</p>
<p>「票子呢？」可是，那客人害怕地說不出來的時候，他們就拍的一聲給他幾個耳光：「你這流氓，沒有錢來搭船嗎？到汕頭就要滾蛋！」</p>
<p>那客人吃了幾個耳光就昏紅了眼珠子的拿着僅有的一件玻藍衫逃避開去，收票員就努着嘴巴的向着別幾個同樣的人吆喝和打罵着。</p>
<p>可是奇怪的是在我旁邊的一個搭客。這個搭客從他和別個同伴的談話里，可以知道他是梅縣的人，從小就開始流浪，在廣西過了許多年，做過兵士，做過小差事，看樣子是二十四五歲的，那一隻含着憤怒而且兇狠的三角形的眼珠子，配上了一副高尖的顴骨，淸瘦而很犂黑的臉孔，薄薄的嘴唇的蓬里透出了不潔白的牙齒牙不過這動不動就咬着牙根的，好像要表現他曾挨過無限的凄凉痛苦，到處只是可憤恨的事包圍着他的一樣。不過，他是一個裝作很有經騐的知識子似的，那一個不滿的籐籃裏還有一套西裝，穿着一件很新的人造絲襯衫，誰都不曾相信他是買不起八塊錢的船票的人的。可是，這一次，他眞的挺出了胸的說沒有錢，那兩個收票員氣得眼睛也瞪着：</p>
<p>「什麽？你沒有錢？誰相信？馬上拿出來，不然你就要滾！」</p>
<p>「我要到上海去，我沒有錢不就必買票，這船是政府的，我們為什麽不可以搭？」他也憤憤地吼着，睜着三角眼的望着他們：「沒有錢！」</p>
<p>「你說沒有錢，我們就搜你的身，船公司是國家的，但經營這生意是買辦的，你沒有一點良心呀！哼！你這野種？流氓！」</p>
<p>他給他們罵得透不出氣的，漲紅了臉的，機密地從袋子裏　出了二塊錢的鈔票來，但又害怕地望了一望他們說：</p>
<p>「只有這點錢，你們要不要？」</p>
<p>那收票員憤恨地瞪了一瞪他，敏捷地攫奪了他的鈔票：</p>
<p>「票也買不夠，算了你，到汕頭就要滾蛋，沒有廉恥的傢伙！」</p>
<p>「不！我給錢買票了，我要到上海去，我不是到汕頭去！」</p>
<p>他焦急地呌着，但是，收票員已走了，只有全部的搭客們很奇異地望着他，這時，他的臉還要紅一點的，好像難過地笑着說道：</p>
<p>「這船是國家的，是為人民而設的，我為什麽要化錢呢？我有錢，我用不着那麽蠢的，我到了上海，就搭火車到南京去，但是我不會買票的！」</p>
<p>他勝利地說着，就望着他的旁邊一個廣西人嘻嘻地笑着。</p>
<p>船過了一天一夜的海程，到了汕頭，那幾個沒買票的人悄悄地離開了船上。這位買不夠票的人却穿起他那一套不大合身的秋季西套來，好像全感不到他曾挨過什麽侮辱似的，他又愉快地在船頭上跑來跑去的，而且上岸去玩了。正午的時候，太陽光溫柔地點着海面那淡綠的水，點着露天的四等艙，靜靜的，沒有許多客人留在這裏，我就開始默默地望着一隻一隻的歌女們在船上徘徊和她們的苦笑的臉兒。</p>
<p>那個客人回來了，帶着汕頭出產的鮮菓和幾個廣西人在喫着談着。</p>
<p>一個十四歲的歌女笑着的答應了他們的意思而唱着那些令人不大快意的十八摸的歌曲了，他就偎着她迷着三角的聽着。一首一首的唱着，完了，她哀求地向他們討錢的時候，他就慢洋洋地搖着頭，好像不滿意地的歌聲似的苦笑着，掏出了兩隻角子來。</p>
<p>「不夠呀！先生！而且這角子不好用呢！」她很嬌媚地扭抳地望着他：「請帮帮忙吧：我們一家八口都靠這一點挨過日子呀！」</p>
<p>「什麽？誰要聽你這不好的歌呀：滾開吧！滾開！娘的！」</p>
<p>這位客人怒吼地，兇着臉，咬着牙根的，就好像驅逐什麽似的。這一呌可把那個歌女嚇着而且流起淚來的走了。於是，他就勝利地望着他的同伴哈哈地笑了起來，好像以為自己的零魂是多麽高崇的。</p>
<p>「這世界！我受苦多了，但我也要顯現一下自己的權威！就非要這樣不成啦！」</p>
<p>他的愉快的樣子和他的話却把我怔着的，我很痛苦地望着這個畸人，沉默着。</p>
<h3 id="c193">迎喜神 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>小炮仗在每家的屋簷下爆豆般的響着，夜緩緩地露出蒼灰色來。</p>
<p>屋里背陰地方還暗沉沉的，黑燈碗中的燈心吐着小小的火頭，一片淡幽幽的光閃動着，爸爸使袖頭揉着那發紅的整夜不睡的眼睛，在地墻脚上咳嗽兩聲，抽口氣，輕輕地把烟袋里的灰叩到窗台上，便對媽說：</p>
<p>「煮餃子去吧，人家都放鞭起五更了。」</p>
<p>媽輕手輕脚的邁出門去，從院里抱了秫稭來。在外間屋的鍋里添了水，秫稭在灶膛里咯卡咯卡的響着，像受了潮的小炮仗，爸爸仍楞怔怔地發呆，他回來還功夫不大，從祭皂的那天他走了，雙盛興藥鋪的高腿李找了他好幾次，鴻昌家也天天來，媽跟人家哭，給人賭咒：說爸爸當兵去了。可是人家不答應，高腿李臨走的時候說：</p>
<p>「他躦矮瓜秧！　躦今年三十，躦不了明年初一。」</p>
<p>人家都上供吃餃子了，爸披着厚厚的一層雪跑回來，媽扭着他，給他掃干凈了衣裳上的雪片，他就爬到坑上抽起烟來。過了陣醒一下淸鼻涕，愁眉不展的嘆口氣。</p>
<p>媽這時候把餃子一個個下到鍋里，使勺子絞了下，燈碗里燒的燈心吱吱地響，火苗輕輕地跳了下，燈就隨着吱的聲滅了，屋里猛然撲滿了昏黑，象棋盤樣的大窗子投過一方淡白的光影。</p>
<p>「迎喜神去吧，小寳子也跟你爸爸去。」</p>
<p>爸爸聽着媽的話，哼了一聲，他把烟袋放在窗台上，爬下坑來一邊戴着「猴兒兜」帽子，一邊說：</p>
<p>「迎喜神，也不上咱們家來呀，他也是檢有福的家主去。」</p>
<p>「大年五更里就說喪氣話。」</p>
<p>媽懣怨着走進屋來，給我戴好那個大紅棉帽子，又結了結腿帶，把我抱下地囑咐着：</p>
<p>「實實在在的磕，盼着咱們今年好過了吧！」</p>
<p>爸爸從皂君桌上拿下喜神碼子　來，另外抽了三支長香，便領着我走出家來，雪停了，風尖颼颼地吹的厲害，臉凍得蘇蘇的發痛，我不讓爸領着了，使手撫着臉，手待一陣脹脹的僵得什麽也不覺了，爸爸看着我笑了笑，便用一隻左胳膊抱着我走，下河坡的時候眞怕，板上凍了好些冰，爸的脚一不留神就滑一下，一步一步慢慢走下坡來，河灘上好大一片白映映的雪，河身上被厚的冰蓋住了。雪，像毛茸茸的閃着茫光的氈子，平靜的鋪到對岸的無邊的田野里，綠色的麥苗埋在亮晶晶的雪層下，整個的灰空罩着一脈閃耀的白光，冷風捲着細小的冰沙飛舞。</p>
<p>橋頭上用蓆搭的小飯鋪子冷淸的關着門，兩隻狗在那門口追着跑，一個高個子賣買人由橋那邊走過來。肩上前着一頭放賬本，一邊擱錢的「搭聯」。</p>
<p>「呌，這要賬的，起五更了才回來</p>
<p>爸爸嘴里說着，把我放下地來指給我看，說完他燃着香，揷到厚厚的雪上，將喜神碼子燒化了，爸爸跪下去，朝北叩着頭，嘴里道念着：</p>
<p>「喜神老爺保佑我一年順順當當，我給你才掛袍貼金。」</p>
<p>他磕完了，打掃着腿上粘的雪粒，我也跑下，那個賣買人晃晃搖搖走到跟前來，我剛磕了一個頭，</p>
<p>「你們家里說你當兵啦，好，不想想，我雙盛興不賒給你幾付藥吃，你說，這當兒是……」</p>
<p>「咳，李掌櫃，我忘不了你的好處，今年找着長工活一定還，」</p>
<p>「天亮就初一，按理說我不該再要賬了，可是我家里還躺着冀州藥行里收賬的呢，頭初十給我凑點，……」</p>
<p>爸爸呑吐吐的應了聲，抱起我來慌張的跑回家來，一進門就大聲的嘆了口氣說：</p>
<p>「喜神！一出門就是個喪那神！」</p>
<p>「註」　「躦矮瓜秧」卽在舊年前躱見債主之意。　「喜神碼子」卽木板印的喜神像。</p>

<p>劉三爺</p>
<p>劉三爺是一個江湖上見義勇為大名鼎鼎的英雄，他的好友鄭二麻子，在軍營裏當排長，為了他的上級——營長——那萬惡的行為，出於義憤而把他殺死了。雖然營長是萬惡，但軍法是不能逃逸的，鄭二麻子以至於負了傷而逃到劉三爺的門口，但劉三爺又因有事上賊去了，只有他的兒子光祖一個人在着，他——鄭二麻子——央求着光祖讓他躱一躱，可是光祖是一個奸滑的少年，又因着鄭二麻子常在他父親面前說他不是，所以他恨着不收留鄭二麻子，但後面追鄭二麻子的王排長帶了兵丁，又快在眼前了。</p>
<p>在這萬急的時候，鄭二麻子終以二塊錢的代價而安身了，王排長在這時也追到了，為了找不到鄭二麻子而拿一只金錶引誘着光祖，二塊錢終勝不過一只金錶，鄭二麻子就這樣被出賣了。</p>
<p>劉三爺回來了，見到他朋友是被兒子所害而又被鄭二麻子罵他是「出聲朋友的奸賊，」損了劉三爺一世英名，但在最後，鄭二麻子呢？是被抓去了，金錶呢？是被擲碎了他兒子呢？是用槍殺了！</p>

<p>萬丈銀河掛碧空。流光如駛又秋風。一年一度天河配。多少相思一夕中。我曉得。大帝之子名織女。香閏寂寞在河東。年年織錦勤勞役。無縫天衣絕代工。所以是，天帝憐其當獨處。許配河西小牧童。那知道，一結同心就愉懶。天帝是，責令歸來仍舊住河東。從此不能常來往。一年一度一相逢。事雖渺茫情可信。要知道，不勤儉不成功。人間天上同此理。勤儉二字用無窮。我曉得，牛郎本是個窮漢子。怎能作婿到天宮。貧富應殊難作配。世間婚嫁亦相同。所以是，莫羨妻財追趕去。莫貪　贈眼睛紅。夫妻結合不講金和寳。志同道合兩情濃。　房伴讀多　事。夫喝婦隨樂融融。又傳說，牛郎婚配天孫日。曾欠聘金十萬對。所以是，處罰你一世牧牛多勞苦。處罰你，一年一度一相逢。若是聘金償不了。永難同夢伴嬌容。軼事異闖共傳說。盡在那，處無漂渺中。不過是，我有別情來點綴。綠章遙奏到天宮。叩求天帝施宏願。莫令天孫住河東。應繳聘金錢十萬。完全轄免濟貧窮。何况是，今歲天時更奇特。旱荒水患一重重。望將聘禮作振欵。廣施雨露沐仁風。若能批准小臣奏。一定是，誠惶誠恐謝蒼穹。水旱兵荒到處有。那得天公事事從。聊書心事快心胸。</p>

<p>家住西湖十景塘。半村半郭水雲鄉。門前儘種垂楊柳。竹葉巴蕉透粉牆。堂上椿萱皆並茂。庭前丹桂亦芬芳。紅　紅俏為使女。桃根桃葉作偏房。家財何必陶朱富。千畝良田稱小康。往來俱是知書客。李白東坡趙子昂。右軍汾部米襄陽。閒談五倫家常事。無非歌賦與文章。金谷園中閒散步。沉香榻上讀西廂。美酒佳餚稱自在。雪高三尺不乏糧。有時節·一局棋。有時節·一爐香。有時節·把書聽。有時節·叉馬雀。有時節·淸歌一曲繞畫樑。人生到此方為福。三萬百年六千丈。何必政家去費心腸。</p>

<p>「暴雨梨花」的出演，是得到了觀眾異常的擁護和輿論界很高評價的，這在編導者馬徐維邦和主演者陳燕燕初次合作成績上可以說是獲得了絕大的安慰。於是他們决定了繼續來合作這一部「寒江落雁」，並且由貂班華和羅朋許多人來共同努力。</p>
<p>一年來的攝製期間，工作者都在絞盡腦汁，聚精會神的努力，我們可以看到它的成績顯然是超越了「暴雨梨花」的前蹟，而有着更進一步的成功。</p>
<p>在「寒江落雁」編劇時，馬徐已决定了演員人選，所以這個劇本不但是適合陳燕燕個性的，而且可以說是比較適合每個演出者的個性的。</p>
<p>為了採景的美滿，「寒江落雁」不但在內景的攝影塲上費盡了工夫，而更遠途的取外景於普陀，這塊風景幽美的勝地，被他們採精取粹收得了許多美的畫面和背景。</p>
<p>這裏就着題材的本身發揮，除了闡明它的社會意義之外，更造成了極濃厚的悲劇空氣，而前半部的美艷哀感景象，更足以使觀眾為之迴腸盪氣的。</p>
<p>陳燕燕曾在寒冬天氣裏拍落水的戲，貂班華有着比在「秋扇明燈」更驚人的成績，羅朋他担任男主角方面極重的戲，馬徐維邦更利用他化裝的絕技，飾演一個古怪的老人。</p>

Representatives from various schools fully expressed their opinions on safeguarding the nation to President Jiang. President Jiang openly announced the government's policy and provided detailed explanations. It is reported that all representatives were able to understand that the intentions of the youth and the government were connected through the results of this meeting. Everyone is of one mind to achieve the common goal of saving the country. At 7:00 AM on the 17th, the reception office provided vehicles to invite all student representatives to visit the Artillery School. The school's instructors sincerely welcomed and guided them on a tour. Education Director Zou Zuohua gave a welcoming speech to the representatives and accompanied them on the visit. They said goodbye at 11:00 AM, and then went to the Central Military Academy Training Corps. The presidents of the various schools who had discussed matters at the Lizhi Society had already arrived when the student representatives arrived. They gathered together and went to the auditorium for a meal. At that time, military music was played, and the order was very solemn. After the meal, Corps Commander Gui Yongqing gave a speech, expressing welcome and mutual encouragement. The representatives were then guided on a tour by the staff of the Corps Headquarters, which ended at 3:30 PM. At 4:00 PM, more than 300 people, including the presidents of various schools and student representatives, paid respects to the fallen soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army and the Songhu Martyrs' Cemetery. The ceremony was solemn and the etiquette was respectful. Presidents of universities and colleges stood in the first row, secondary school principals in the second row, and student representatives in the third row. Zhang Boling presided over the ceremony and presented wreaths. After the ceremony, they returned to their residences separately. It is said that they will all depart for their schools on the 18th.

The original text reads: We, one hundred and sixty-four presidents of universities, colleges, and secondary schools in eighteen provinces and cities, hereby solemnly declare: Supporting the integrity of the national territory and sovereignty, trusting the government, and opposing any separatist movements; Doing our best to implement education that meets the needs of the national crisis; Maintaining the lifeblood of education, and restraining strikes and disruptive behavior.

<p>Nanjing – The meeting of representatives from various schools convened by President Jiang concluded on the 17th.

After returning to school, I will report the results of this meeting in detail to my colleagues and students in the school to achieve the common goal of saving the country. Finally, he said that he deeply believed that people across the country sympathize with the patriotic expressions made by students recently, but these expressions are also limited and should know when to stop. If they abandon their studies and neglect to cultivate their own academic abilities, it is not the way to save the country. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing – On the morning of the 17th, Minister of Education Wang Shijie invited school principals to Beijing to talk at the Lizhi Society. Wang first reported and proposed two cases: how to improve teaching materials at all levels of schools to meet the needs of the national crisis and school discipline. The principals expressed many opinions, and all agreed that the education plan during the national crisis should include all levels of schools and general public training, focusing on practical applications. A special committee should be formed by the Ministry of Education to gather experts to discuss and determine a concrete plan for implementation. Regarding the school discipline case, it was generally believed that to consolidate the foundation of educational life, a declaration should be issued. The meeting ended at noon.

<p>Tianjin – The Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee's regular meeting on the 17th was suspended because Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Wang Jidang, Gao Lingjue, Pan Yugui, and Li Tingyu were all in Tianjin and had not returned. No regular meeting will be held before the Spring Festival. The cases to be discussed will be decided after Song Zheyuan returns to Peiping after the festival. The organizational regulations of the Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee will be changed, and the chairman's autocratic system will still be adopted, and the standing committee members will be abolished to avoid conflicts in the establishment. A vice chairman will be appointed under the chairman to assist in handling affairs. Song Zheyuan will implement this after returning to Peiping next year. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Peiping – The Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee's official seal has been sent to Peiping by the National Government and was put into use yesterday. All personnel in the committee will be appointed separately today and tomorrow. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>Tianjin – Doihara did not leave on the 16th due to unfinished business and remains in Tianjin awaiting the resolution of the Hebei-East and Chahar-East issues. The situation of the Ji-Cha negotiations has improved, and those responsible for mediation are very optimistic. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Peiping – Regarding the Hebei-East issue, after Song Zheyuan, Xiao Zhenying, Chen Juesheng, and Chen Zhongfu started discussions with Doihara, Tada, etc. in Tianjin yesterday, a solution has been discussed. They are currently discussing ways to cancel the measures. It is said that the personal issue of Yin Rugeng is also being discussed. A real solution has been discussed for Hebei-East tax revenues. In the future, the tax revenues of Hebei Province can maintain the integrity of the system. The results of the meeting between the two sides have made progress, and a major conclusion can be announced before the Lunar New Year. After the Hebei-East issue is resolved, negotiations on the Chahar-North matter will begin. According to related sources, the solution will not deviate from maintaining the status quo. In the future, the administration of the six counties in Chahar North will still be under the overall management of the Chahar Provincial Government. Chahar Chairman Zhang Zizhong returned to Chahar from Peiping yesterday morning and arrived in Zhangheng last night. He cabled the Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee this morning to report on the situation of the six counties in Chahar North. The committee has cabled Tianjin to report to Song. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – At 10:00 AM on the 17th, Doihara went to Song Zheyuan's residence on 17th Road in the British Concession to visit Song Zheyuan to continue discussing the Hebei-East and Chahar-East issues. Regarding the Dagu and Chaoyangmen incidents, the Japanese side stated that the Consul General in Tianjin, Kawagoe, would be responsible for the negotiations. At noon on the 17th, Song summoned Xiao Zhenying and Chen Juesheng to his private residence to discuss how to deal with the Ji-Cha issues and the negotiating steps for the Chaoyangmen and Dagu incidents. In the afternoon, Chen Juesheng and Chen Zhongfu, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, were sent to the Tokiwa Ryokan in the Japanese Concession to visit Doihara to convey Song's views on resolving the various matters. The two sides talked for two hours before parting. The Ji-Cha negotiations are quite promising, and a peaceful resolution may be reached within the week. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – Doihara was scheduled to go to Peiping yesterday, but since Song Zheyuan has decided to spend the New Year in Tianjin, Doihara has postponed his trip. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Peiping – There will be changes in the administrative personnel in North China. Since Song Zheyuan currently holds three positions concurrently, he may transfer the position of Chairman of Hebei to Qin Dechun. Xiao Zhenying will succeed as Mayor of Peiping in the future, and there is talk that Yin Rugeng will be the candidate for Mayor of Tianjin. If this comes true, it must be that the Chinese authorities want to abolish the Hebei East Autonomous Council. However, whether this attempt can succeed is still questionable, because everyone believes that Yin's material rights cannot be revoked without the consent of the Japanese military authorities in eastern East. In addition, Chen Zhongfu, the current director of the Foreign Affairs Committee, also hopes to become the mayor of Tianjin. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<h3 id="e7">Japanese Consul General in Tianjin Convened Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Smuggled Goods in Eastern Hebei <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin – Yamahai, the former Japanese Consul in Erji, came to Tianjin. On the morning of the 17th, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin convened a meeting. Consuls and Vice Consuls from various branch offices gathered in Tianjin to attend to discuss the handling of the issue of smuggled goods in Eastern Hebei. It was decided to support the realization of the Hebei East government's tariff autonomy and to conclude an agreement with Yin Rugeng, and then help him prevent the import of tax-evading Japanese goods. A Japanese steamship loaded with tax-evading Japanese goods entered Tanggu on the evening of the 16th. Zhao Lei's troops of the pseudo-security team prohibited the unloading of goods from the shore, resulting in a conflict. The Japanese consulate in Tianjin sent personnel to investigate on the 17th. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – A certain party instigated the puppet government of Eastern Hebei to establish tariff autonomy and create separate tariff regulations. A certain party believes that there are too many smuggled tax-evading goods in Eastern Hebei, and disputes often occur, all because Chinese tariffs are too high. If the puppet Hebei East government can achieve tariff independence and conclude a reciprocal treaty with a certain country, that country will decide to assist in cracking down on smuggling and guarantee that such things will not happen again. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The stamp tax tickets of the puppet Hebei East government were issued on the 15th. All stores will be required to affix stamps to their books from the 1st. Old Ministry of Finance stamp tickets are prohibited from being purchased. It is rumored that the North Ning Road funds, the Changlu salt tax, and the national taxes of Hebei Province have been intercepted by the North China authorities and not transferred to the central government. After inquiring with relevant parties, it was denied. The road funds, national taxes, and salt taxes are still transferred to the central government in installments through the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, except for the original deductions used for the affairs themselves. (Special dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The Japanese military authorities are currently considering countermeasures due to the rampant smuggling of tax-evading goods in Eastern Hebei. The Japanese side believes that the reason for the smuggling is that the tax rate is too high, so it advocates that the authorities in Eastern Hebei formulate separate tax rates. According to sources in Tanggu, a motorboat loaded with rayon and sugar sailed into Tanggu last night and was seized by the Eastern Hebei Security Team. Everyone believes that the reason why smuggling is active in Tanggu is that the authorities in Qinhuangdao and Changli are strictly preventing it, so smuggling has shifted to Tanggu. The Japanese consul in Yuguan is currently discussing this matter with the local authorities. It is said that Eastern Hebei has issued stamps and prohibited the use of central government stamps. The Japanese military spokesman did not say that North China's tax revenue is purely a Chinese affair and Japan can only make suggestions. Currently, it does not want to detain North China's customs duties, salt taxes, and railway revenues, but future compromises are now under consideration. The spokesman also discussed the rumor that British Ambassador Maude and the central authorities are discussing how to protect the British interests of the Beining Railway, saying that everything can be arranged if there is an order from Nanjing.

<h3 id="e12">The Seriousness of the Chahar North Issue <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese and puppet troops occupied six counties of Chahar, the essence of Chahar Province, half of the area has been lost, and the Suiyuan border is becoming increasingly critical. Recently, it was reported that the authorities in Peiping are discussing with the Japanese side to resolve the Chahar North issue and have reached a compromise on the local administration of the six counties, that is, the candidates for the county magistrates of the six counties will be dispatched by the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and then formally appointed by the Chahar Provincial Government. Whether this matter can be resolved in this way is still a question. Judging from the Japanese advance, they must take one step at a time in the Inner Mongolia area, and it is feared that there is no other peaceful way to stop them from advancing along the PingSui Railway. Japan obviously has a plan to conquer all of our Inner Mongolian territory and develop towards Outer Mongolia and attack the Soviet Union. The military actions in Chahar North are the beginning of this.</p>
<p>In terms of the geographical situation of the six counties in Chahar North, the area controls the Zhangku Highway, which is the throat of China's transportation with Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia. The Zhangku Highway is cut off, and Sino-Russian commerce cannot proceed. There is no way to communicate between Kulun and Peiping. Zhangbei can control the PingSui Railway when it goes south, and the PingSui Railway is the lifeline of Inner Mongolia and the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. Japan's plan is not only to connect the South Manchuria Railway with the Beining Railway, but also to connect the Beining and PingSui Railways, so that Japanese troops coming from Dalian can reach Inner Mongolia directly via the South Manchuria, Beining, and PingSui Railways, and can also connect to the Zhangku Highway from various roads, stationing troops on the border of Outer Mongolia and threatening Kulun. If this plan is realized, Korea and Suiyuan can have direct traffic, and Inner and Outer Mongolia and the provinces of Sui, Jin, Shaanxi, Hebei will have no peaceful days.</p>
<p>Japan's plan to conquer Inner and Outer Mongolia originally had a concrete plan. The occupation of the six counties of Guyuan was the beginning of the implementation of this plan. In the eyes of the Doihara generation, the creation of the so-called "Mongolian Country" is more important than the "Manchukuo" because only by controlling Mongolia can the goal of controlling the Asian continent be achieved. What Asian history has shown is that only the forces north of the Great Wall can control China for a long time. Therefore, when the puppet state of Manchuria was created, the Japanese divided the Mongolian people in Manchuria into an "Xing'an Autonomous Province" and gave them considerable autonomy to make it a base point for the "Mongolian Country" plan. There are two or three million Mongolians in Xing'an Province, which is half of the total Mongolian population. The Japanese used Hulun (Hailar) as the base for inciting the Mongolian people to break away from China. On the one hand, they threatened Outer Mongolia, and on the other hand, they lured Inner Mongolia. Fortunately, the princes of Inner Mongolia were still able to distinguish between friends and enemies and did not fall into the Japanese conspiracy in the past. Outer Mongolia relied on Soviet Russia for support. Although it has repeatedly made concessions to the Japanese and Manchurian invasion, it is quite limited. Now that Japan has reached out to Chahar Province, not only is the regime in the Bai Ling Temple area in grave danger, but Kulun is also like a sharp sword in the abdomen, and its life is in danger. The situation is more serious than the September 18th Incident.</p>
<p>Japan's means of dealing with our country are the most cruel, namely, creating many puppet states in our country's territory, directly ruled by Japanese officials and occupied by Japanese troops. The puppet state of Manchuria is a completed puppet. The so-called "Hebei East Anti-Communist Government" is the core of the second puppet. Japan not only has no intention of abolishing this pseudo-organization, but also wants to incorporate the Ji-Cha Political Affairs Committee to complete its so-called "North China State" plan. In Inner Mongolia, Japan is also using the Xing'an Autonomous Province as the core to create another expanded puppet organization. The Mongolian Political Affairs Committee has already become the target of the Japanese to seize as their own. Once the six counties of Guyuan are lost, it will be difficult to return them. In the future, if the area south of the desert unfortunately becomes the second Manchuria, the northern crisis will be so severe. Can the people of the country still sit idly by and not think about rising up to save the situation?</p>
<h3 id="e13">Records of the Legislative Yuan Meeting: Approval of the 23rd Year Supplementary Budget; No Need to Formulate a Real Estate Mortgage Law <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Legislative Yuan held its 43rd regular meeting on the morning of the 17th. Seventy-one members, including Zhou Wei, attended. Sun Ke presided, with Liang Hancao as Secretary-General. The following matters were resolved: The supplementary budget for the 23rd year for national ordinary revenue and expenditure was approved as is. The agreement and detailed rules for the exchange of parcels between post offices in Malaya and China were approved as is. The Executive Yuan's request to formulate a Real Estate Property Rights Registration Law was resolved that the Land Law and its implementation regulations already have provisions for real estate property rights registration, and there is no need to formulate a separate single law. The Executive Yuan's request to formulate an Auction Law was resolved that regarding auction procedures, the Yuan is drafting a Compulsory Execution Law, which should include appropriate provisions. The Executive Yuan's request to formulate a Real Estate Mortgage Law was resolved that the Civil Code already has provisions for real estate mortgages, and there is no need to formulate a separate single law. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Executive Yuan consulted the Legislative Yuan, stating that regarding the exercise of mortgage rights, it is permissible in areas where land surveys are completed and the registration system is relatively complete, to handle matters in accordance with Article 873, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, without being bound by Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan. Additionally, factory machinery can be regarded as accessories in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code and mortgaged together with real estate. The Executive Yuan requested the Judicial Yuan to investigate and interpret this matter. Now, the Ministry of Finance reports that new monetary policies are being implemented and methods should be added to increase the activity capacity of general banks, and also plans to establish a special organization to handle real estate mortgage business to facilitate financial circulation. Regarding real estate mortgage laws and regulations, it is hoped that the Judicial and Legislative Yuans will revise and formulate them as early as possible to provide a basis for regulating finance and rescuing the industrial and commercial crisis. Accordingly, the Legislative Yuan was consulted for review. The Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 17th resulted in a decision that, except for the fact that the Civil Code already has provisions for real estate mortgages and there is no need to formulate a separate single law, two additional points were interpreted: The original intention of Article 873, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code is that if the mortgage creditor's debt has reached the repayment period and has not been repaid, they may petition the court to sell the mortgaged property through auction procedures to show caution, without needing to go through a final judgment. The Legislative Yuan is drafting a Compulsory Execution Law, and it also intends to add appropriate provisions regarding auction procedures. As for whether Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan should be changed, since the Executive Yuan has consulted the Judicial Yuan to handle it, the Legislative Yuan is not in a position to comment. The meaning of accessories is already defined in Article 68 of the Civil Code. If the factory machinery mentioned complies with the provisions of that article, it can naturally be regarded as accessories. Since the Executive Yuan has consulted the Judicial Yuan for interpretation, the Legislative Yuan does not need to comment. It is noted that this case is because the Judicial Yuan, regarding the mortgagee's request to auction the mortgaged property, once used Interpretation No. 493, requiring that it could only be done after a final judgment. However, courts often delay in resolving such debt cases, causing those who invest in real estate to suffer losses, and the real estate mortgage business also declined as a result. The Executive Yuan's request for the Legislative Yuan to formulate a Real Estate Mortgage Law was to seek a remedy for this matter and to regulate social finance. However, the Legislative Yuan believes that Article 873 of the Civil Code stipulates that a mortgagee's auction of mortgaged property must be applied for to the court, and the original intention was to seek caution in the procedures. Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan seems to be a misunderstanding. Real estate mortgages are already provided for in the Civil Code. The reason for the decline in real estate mortgage business is not due to the lack of a Real Estate Mortgage Law, but entirely due to the constraints of Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan. Therefore, the meeting on the 17th decided that there is no need to formulate a Real Estate Mortgage Law. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>During the Legislative Yuan's meeting on the 17th to review the draft Auction Law, the Civil Law Committee believed that the auction procedure would be appropriately stipulated in the Compulsory Execution Law being drafted, so there was no need to formulate a separate single law. Some legislators then questioned the Civil Law Committee, stating that various parties urgently need an Auction Law, such as customs auctions of seized smuggled goods and bank pawnshops auctioning overdue mortgages. Will the auction procedures be fully covered in the future Compulsory Execution Law? Besides the application of judicial punishment, is the Compulsory Execution Law applicable to other dispositions? The Civil Law Committee was requested to explain. Otherwise, an Auction Law should still be formulated to meet the needs of all parties. The Civil Law Committee replied that the opinions expressed by the committee members could be used as references when drafting the Compulsory Execution Law. The review report was then passed, rejecting the formulation of an Auction Law. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>

<p>Nanjing: At the meeting held by the Economic Council's Water Conservancy Association on the 6th, the Water Conservancy Department proposed a proposal to determine the national water conservancy construction policy, which was passed by the general assembly. The original proposal is as follows: For disaster prevention projects, build dikes to prevent floods. The central water conservancy authorities in various basins should make full use of local financial and human resources to manage political river work. The central government will plan it. For projects that increase benefits, vigorously construct projects that increase benefits that do not conflict with the fundamental plans for governing various rivers to increase national wealth. The central government will provide loans to local governments to handle it. For surveying work, make full use of aerial surveys for ordinary rivers. For testing work, pay attention to accuracy in hydrological testing and establish contact with foreign measuring stations. For investigation work and water conservancy development and flood elimination, invite experts from the League of Nations to investigate in order to design projects.

<h3 id="e53">On Expanding Borders <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Intolerable</p>
<p>The greatest crisis in the world today lies in the demands of a few ambitious countries to expand their borders. Therefore, the border issue has become the most concerning issue worldwide. The renowned American journalist Lewis Rex Miller recently wrote an essay examining this issue with an objective and broad perspective. Although at first glance it may seem to carry a hint of American imperialism, its central idea truly leans towards global harmony. The original article was published in the Christian Science Monitor, and the following is an abridged translation:</p>
<p>Rasmond Robins, an American socio-economic scholar, once gave a speech entitled "The Last Frontier." By "The Last Frontier," he was referring to Alaska and the Klondike. Indeed, in the long history of the expansion of the American continent, these two places can truly be said to be the last frontiers. Americans generally feel that the determination of these borders has created a historical turning point. From then on, brave pioneers no longer aspired to place any newly uncultivated land under American rule.</p>
<p>Almost simultaneously, just before the World War, the division of the African continent by European colonial powers, except for Abyssinia and Liberia, had been completed. All the islands in the Pacific Ocean were seized by the great powers, and acquiring new territories in the Asian continent was no longer as easy as before. Everyone felt that the expansion of political borders was encountering increasing obstacles, which would inevitably lead to conflicts between countries. Indeed, the World War was caused by this.</p>
<p>Today, nearly twenty years have passed since the possibility of completely exhausting the expansion of borders, but many countries are still expanding their borders at an alarming rate. These so-called borders are not only political but also economic and cultural.</p>
<p>The most obvious and most often thought of is the "political border." Japan has expanded its borders beyond Manchuria and is currently working to place a large part of North China under its de facto control. Italy has expanded its borders to the more southern parts of Libya and is currently striving to incorporate Abyssinia into its colonial territory. These two are prominent examples of expanding borders by traditional military means.</p>
<p>Less obvious is the expansion of the "strategic border." In the winter of 1934, Baldwin declared that Britain would take the Rhine River as its border. When he said this, he did not mean that Britain would seize the territory and administration of Belgium and the Netherlands, but rather that due to the development of aviation, such a huge change had taken place in the military aspect that Britain could no longer rely on the traditional first line of defense! The fleet in the English Channel and the North Sea! Instead, it had to find more distant bases and prepare to resist attacks far from its borders.</p>
<p>Even more elusive than political and strategic borders are "economic borders." In a sense, we can say that every time an Easterner buys a Ford car, the American border expands once. The world market is no different from a large battlefield, and the major business competitors are all in this battlefield, forever seeking to expand their scope of operations. The expansion of this economic border is so significant that it can almost be said that any country is included within the borders of any other country. Clear evidence can be seen from the American dining table. Cuba (sugar), China and Japan (rice, porcelain), Ireland (linen), Italy and Spain (olive oil), Dutch East Indies (pepper), Mexico (vanilla), Costa Rica (bananas), Ceylon (cinnamon), Arabia and Turkey (dates and figs), and the economic borders of many other countries, have they not already rushed into American dining rooms?</p>
<p>In this situation, the expansion of borders will continue until the borders virtually cease to exist. Although the increase in tariffs creates serious barriers to the exchange of goods, it cannot prevent the inevitable international communication. The expansion of economic borders is absolutely necessary for any modern country. The result should not be conflict, but mutual satisfaction.</p>
<p>If the expansion of economic borders reaches the point where the borders between countries are almost indistinguishable, then "cultural borders" are naturally even more difficult to discern. Tariff barriers and censorship are absolutely incapable of resisting languages and scripts. Speeches broadcast on shortwave radio in Boston can be heard by audiences in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and Asia. The difficulties of written language can be overcome by translation.</p>
<p>A culture more consistent than previously known is currently widely prevalent on the surface of the Earth. Europeans feel that Europe is becoming Americanized. Americans feel that America is becoming Europeanized. Asians and Africans are adopting Western civilization, at least in material terms. Japan, which has always regarded Westernization as terrible, has now become the most enthusiastic promoter of Western civilization in the Eastern world. The natives of Africa know how to use modern films to open up their backwardness, while European artists use the handicrafts of primitive peoples as norms for their works. English speakers currently account for more than eleven percent of the world's population.</p>
<p>In the field of natural science, astonishing border expansions have been created in recent years. The new telescope on Mount Palomar in California will undoubtedly reveal the universe of objects previously considered speculative. Undersea exploration has discovered previously unknown patterns of animal life. Aircraft have soared to previously unattainable altitudes. The polar regions have become hunting grounds for daring aviators and explorers.</p>
<p>"Moral borders" have also expanded greatly. Respect for individual freedom has led almost every country to abolish slavery. The last barrier of legal slavery existing under the sun has collapsed with the recent abolition movement of the Emperor of Abyssinia. The progress of humanitarianism and the awareness of the status of women has eliminated many陋習 (lòu xí, bad customs) such as widow immolation in India. Disgust for the long-standing military system has led to the establishment of institutions such as the Peace Court, the League of Nations, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact.</p>
<p>Borders are expanding without limit and will eventually cease to be borders. If our goal is to acquire a certain territory or a certain market, the result will certainly be conflict. But if our goal is in an unlimited territory concerning the common welfare of all mankind, then the result will not be conflict but cooperation. (Translated from Lewis Rex Miller's essay)</p>

<h3 id="e54">Naval Four-Power Conference Passes Shipbuilding Notification Proposal Qualitative Restrictions to be Discussed After Japan's Withdrawal <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The First Committee of the London Naval Conference met this afternoon, without the presence of Japanese representatives. It was agreed that shipbuilding procedures should be mutually notified in advance. This is the first compromise reached by the conference.</p>
<p>Although the First Committee encountered setbacks in the work of the naval conference due to Japan's withdrawal, it was still able to make progress. The parties to the naval conference expressed satisfaction with this today. The committee unanimously passed an important proposal on exchanging shipbuilding procedures. It is the consensus that this is a good sign for the smooth progress of its future work. People who are very close to the representatives of various countries now hold a kind of hope that when the First Committee continues to meet tomorrow, it will be able to agree on the general instructions to be given to the technical sub-committee. Then, the sub-committee will discuss everything in order to draft a full text of an agreement. Once the sub-committee passes the issue, the First Committee will discuss the issue of qualitative disarmament. All newspapers are now emphasizing the importance of stipulating clauses to prevent competition in the types of warships, as this could lead to naval competition in a dangerous way. However, several parties now believe that the committee will be able to reach a compromise on the main points of the whole issue. It is expected that if the Four-Power Conference can once agree on a temporary agreement on exchanging shipbuilding procedures and qualitative naval disarmament, it will invite other naval countries that have not sent representatives to the naval conference to send representatives to freely discuss the results achieved with the four countries. Any agreement will of course contain a safeguard clause, so that signatory countries may declare the cancellation of the agreement if the actions of non-signatory countries force them to declare its cancellation.</p>

<p>The committee passed a letter to Nagano, the chief Japanese representative, stating that it was regrettable that the Japanese side had decided to withdraw from the conference, and asking him to continue to participate in the conference as an observer. The meeting was then adjourned until tomorrow, at which time a small committee will be appointed to summarize the plans opened by Britain, France, and Italy for discussing qualitative restrictions. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London The representatives of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy attending the London Naval Conference today invited the Japanese representatives who withdrew from the conference yesterday to send observers to participate in the remaining discussions, but the Japanese representatives may not attend a special committee where the representatives of the four countries will discuss their procedures. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Status of the Naval Conference Remains Unchanged <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The committee also agreed that the status of the naval conference should not be changed in the slightest, and should still be called the 1935 London Naval Conference. A British representative explained to a Reuters reporter the reason for not changing the status of the conference, saying that it was hoped that the various resolutions of the naval conference would be accepted by Japan in the future, as the usefulness and merit of the various resolutions depended largely on Japan's attitude towards the resolutions. He deeply regretted Japan's withdrawal from the conference, and if the Japanese side had not been so resolute, the naval conference could have accomplished good work. Japanese newspapers claim that Japan does not want to embark on a warship competition. This is true, and other countries do not want this competition either. But without a compromise, I am afraid that competition will be unavoidable. The most dangerous competition is in the qualitative aspect. Britain sympathizes with Japan's political difficulties, but Japan's withdrawal from the conference, its unwillingness to discuss quantitative or qualitative restrictions, and its unwillingness to exchange shipbuilding procedures, only makes the crisis of competition more urgent.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Britain and the United States Will Not Compete in Shipbuilding <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>When a Reuters reporter asked whether there was a possibility of shipbuilding competition between Britain and the United States, the speaker replied that the two countries had the same purpose and both wanted to maintain the principle of equality, but there was no agreement to bind both parties. Judging from this, the United States does not seem to recognize the need to increase the strength of cruisers. The speaker also said that the British and American representatives did not want to have bilateral talks on the issue of relative numbers. It has been found that Britain and the United States had bilateral talks long before the naval conference closed. Judging from the British spokesperson's remarks now, both parties have already had a satisfactory and clear understanding on this point. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Naval Conference Continues to Meet <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>London According to the naval conference, this reporter learned from British official circles that the delegations of the four countries to the naval conference are scheduled to discuss tomorrow the suggestions made by France, Italy, and Britain regarding the exchange of shipbuilding information, so as to establish an agreement in principle, and then appoint several experts to form a sub-committee to stipulate the details of the implementation of the above suggestions. At the same time, the naval conference will discuss the general issue of qualitative restrictions. It is generally believed that there is considerable hope of reaching an agreement on this matter. As for the invitation of the Soviet Union and Russia to participate in the conference, it will be considered only after the above-mentioned agreement in principle has been established. In the future, observers from Japan will attend the meetings of the General Committee of the Naval Conference. Once an agreement is reached, Japan will also be notified of its contents. The British side advocates that the nature of the agreement must be as general as possible, and must also include a guarantee clause to cope with the various needs arising from Japan's future naval policy. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>London The spokesperson for the British delegation issued a statement on the 16th, saying that the First Committee decided at its meeting on the 16th to continue the 1935 London Disarmament Conference, the purpose of which is to enable Japan to participate in the repatriation agreement in the future. Japan's participation in the agreement is of great importance to the effectiveness of the naval agreement. Therefore, any treaties concluded by the four countries must adopt a form in which Japan can participate, because Britain sincerely hopes that Japan will ease its attitude in the future and participate in the agreement. It is a pity that Japan suddenly announced its withdrawal when the conference was about to discuss the issue of quality. If Japan's attitude had some accommodating nature, such a situation could have been avoided. Japan has made it clear that it has no intention of competing in shipbuilding, but if there is no similar agreement on restrictions, competition is almost inevitable. In this case, the only effective limitation on capacity is the limit of each country's financial capacity. However, this financial restriction is by no means a sufficient restriction, and competition in the qualitative aspect is more dangerous. It is a pity that Japan withdrew from the conference before we discussed the issue of quantitative and qualitative restrictions. The revision of the Washington Treaty has lost hope due to Japan's withdrawal from the conference. Today, Britain must also re-examine the issue of Pacific defense. (Domei News Agency, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Roman Newspaper Comments <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Roman evening newspapers today criticized Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Conference, all agreeing that Japan's move has clarified the situation of the naval issue, because all international conferences are nothing but beneficial to the strongest countries, who set specific disadvantageous ratios for other countries, thinking that it is convenient for themselves. There is nothing more hateful than this. The naval conference is also the same. Moreover, since the conclusion of the Washington Treaty, competition among countries in shipbuilding within limits has become a competition for political advantages. Therefore, from our observation, Japan's withdrawal from the naval conference is not a disaster. On the contrary, the situation in which countries were at odds and were constantly arguing has now disappeared, and Japan can build the navy it wants as it pleases according to its needs. The Badano Post said that those who want to engage in negotiations will find that their dreams are in vain, because negotiations will ultimately only involve the necessary objectives.

<p>Tokyo Due to the breakdown of the arms reduction conference, the Japanese Navy is watching the attitudes of Britain and the United States with a cautious attitude, as there will be no treaty to limit the military preparations of various countries. The current actual strength of Britain, the United States, and Japan, that is, the total tonnage of warships, is 700,000 tons for Japan, 800,000 tons for the United States, and 1,000,000 tons for Britain. The difference between Japan and the United States is only 100,000 tons. Comparing only auxiliary ships, Japan has 350,000 tons, the United States has 270,000 tons, and Britain has 390,000 tons. However, since 1931, the United States has been carrying out shipbuilding work with the Benson Plan and the industrial recovery funds, building a navy within the scope allowed by the treaty. When this plan is completed, that is, in 1941, the actual ratio between Japan and the United States will become 6 to 10, with Japan occupying a 60% disadvantage in naval power against the United States. Therefore, the Japanese Navy has decided on a policy to establish an independent economic military preparation for the completion of national defense in these few years. Observing the shipbuilding status of Britain and the United States, and anticipating the future status, they hold the view that there will not be fierce shipbuilding competition.</p>
<p>"United States" Since 1931, the United States has started the construction of 61 warships in total, including those under construction and those planned for construction in the future, with a total tonnage of 229,000 tons. However, because its 15 capital ships have exceeded the prescribed number of years of service, they will have to start building new ships to replace them next year when the treaty expires. Therefore, judging from its capacity, it is definitely unable to expand its shipbuilding plan beyond the established plan. Moreover, judging from the domestic situation, it does not seem likely to start building large warships immediately.</p>
<p>"Britain" Since 1931, Britain has built three Class B cruisers, nine destroyers, and three submarines every year, and has also implemented a major plan to supplement auxiliary ships. However, many of Britain's capital ships are old and will need to build three ships in 1941 and eight ships in 1942. As for its aircraft carriers, except for the Hermes, all are old ships and are busy building their replacements. (Domei News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>London The Daily Telegraph recently learned that the naval shipbuilding program recently formulated by the Cabinet Defense Committee stipulates that all types of warships must be started to be built to reach the limits permitted by the Washington and London Treaties. As for the cruiser item, the London Treaty stipulates a limit of 50 vessels, and it is now planned to build 70 vessels immediately.

<p>London The Morning Post, with the authorization of the authorities, began today to publicize the Cabinet's policy of consolidating military preparations in a major way. Most dignitaries, such as the Archbishop of York, Admiral of the Navy Lord Beatty, former Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell, former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain, and Zhang Bolun, have all sent letters to the newspaper to support this policy. In addition, the newspaper also published an article exposing the weaknesses of the British Navy. It is said that after several British warships were sent to the Mediterranean last year, well-informed people in the naval circles immediately realized that once these warships seriously engaged in combat and used ammunition, the ammunition would be exhausted after one battle. This is one of the weaknesses. From 1927 to 1932, the number of naval personnel was repeatedly reduced, resulting in a lack of experienced soldiers in the British Navy. This is the second weakness. Regarding this point, the newspaper advocates that naval soldiers whose terms of service have expired should continue to serve. Also, the number of capital ships, cruisers, and destroyers in Britain is insufficient, and the construction of new ships is too slow. For example, only three armored ships can be built at the same time. This is the third weakness. (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>London This afternoon, the Cabinet Defense Committee continued to meet, which was the fourth meeting this week. Foreign Affairs Councilor Sir Vansittart, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Chatfield, and Chief of Air Staff General Ellington all attended. According to this reporter, the British Cabinet is now most concerned about the issue of consolidating military preparations, because if the League of Nations wants to implement a tough policy, it must be supported by effective methods. In addition, Germany is now actively reorganizing its military preparations, and it is said that its scale is extremely large, which has made the Cabinet uneasy. Therefore, it is planned to issue new national defense bonds to fund the consolidation of military preparations. According to financial circles, the Army Department recently contacted the famous arms dealer Vickers-Armstrong Factory to order arms, and it is said that the quantity is more than four times the factory's existing manufacturing capacity. It is also said that Rolls-Royce, which specializes in manufacturing automobile and aircraft engines, has also been requested by the government to reduce automobile production in order to increase the production of aircraft engines. The authorities are now planning to explain the various needs of the diplomatic situation to public opinion, and to persuade them to accept a large-scale plan for consolidating military preparations. The Morning Post has been authorized by the government to start this publicity today. It is heard that the Cabinet anticipates that Germany will raise issues such as abolishing the demilitarized zone on both sides of the Rhine River, Austria, Memel, and colonies, so the above-mentioned plan for consolidating military preparations is eagerly hoped to be completed in advance in preparation for it. Regarding the colonial issue, the Cabinet generally intends to avoid the use of force and supports amending the current colonial system in a peaceful manner in accordance with Article 19 of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

<p>London According to this reporter, Foreign Secretary Eden met with the German Ambassador Hirschfeld in recent days to discuss the agreement reached by the general staffs of Britain and France, and the German government also discussed this matter with the British Ambassador Sir Phipps. Britain will reiterate to the Soviet Union the guarantees it previously made, stating that the above-mentioned agreement is purely related to the Mediterranean situation, because it is feared that Italy may launch an attack on the British Navy after the implementation of sanctions, so it is a precautionary measure and has no other intentions. It is said that Germany has expressed satisfaction with this explanation. (Havas News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>London Britain and France recently inquired with Britain about this in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations. Reuters has learned that the British Foreign Office today told Germany that when the experts of the two countries were conducting discussions, they did not mention the eastern border of France. This technical agreement is only related to the Mediterranean. At the same time, Britain asked the German government to pay attention to the attacks on this mutual assistance agreement by the German newspapers. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris The Daily News recently received news from its Berlin correspondent that, according to reliable sources, the French Ambassador to Germany, 龐賽 (Pang Sai), visited the Foreign Minister of the Soviet Union, 蒲洛 (Pu Luo), on Sunday, and the two sides talked for a long time. 龐賽 (Pang Sai) explained that the German newspapers thought that the general staffs of Britain and France had signed a technical agreement on the security of the northeastern border of France, which was attacked and considered to be "a violation of the Locarno Treaty." French politicians were shocked by this. (Note: Some time ago, German newspapers issued warnings, saying that if Britain and France really concluded this agreement, it would be a violation of the Locarno Treaty, and Germany might try to get rid of the treaty obligations it bore for establishing a demilitarized zone on the left bank of the Rhine River by the Treaty of Versailles.) In addition, 龐賽 (Pang Sai) also told 蒲洛 (Pu Luo) that if the Rhine Province were to be remilitarized, the impact would be something that the German government could not ignore. 蒲洛 (Pu Luo) listened without expressing approval or disapproval, but "as far as I (the reporter claims) know, the German government has entrusted Ambassador Hirsch in England to provide assurances to the British government, saying that Germany has no intention of remilitarizing the left bank of the Rhine River. However, since the French side has not received any notification of this news, it should be reserved." (Havas News Agency, 17th)</p>

<p>A report from the Paris Petit Parisien newspaper, citing sources in the Egyptian capital, claims that a new brigade of British ground troops, led by Major General Howard, arrived there today. The brigade is divided into four regiments: the Cheshire Regiment, the Gloucestershire Regiment, the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, and the Lancashire Regiment. Furthermore, a division of ground troops, along with mechanized cavalry, totaling approximately 20,000 personnel, carrying the latest weaponry, arrived in Egypt in the middle of last week. The authorities have kept the exact numbers and deployment locations of the aforementioned troops secret. However, according to sources of the Petit Parisien newspaper, the total number of British troops stationed in Egypt currently reaches 75,000. The garrison strength in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan has also recently been reinforced, and defensive fortifications have been actively constructed since the Italian forces concentrated in Italian Libya in North Africa last year, and have yet to cease. Consequently, the Egyptian people are deeply impressed. Semi-official sources say that the measures taken by the British have two purposes: first, to prevent an Italian invasion of Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and second, to prepare for a military agreement with Egypt, thereby forming a secure network for the British Empire's sea and land transportation routes.

<p>A correspondent with the Italian army reports today from Rome about the fierce battle between the main force of the Abyssinian army under General Nasibu and the Italian column under General Graziani near the Ganale Dorya River. The report states that the battle has virtually ended, with the Italian forces advancing over 43 miles in four days. The Italian forces faced fierce resistance from machine-gun nests hidden in camouflaged semi-circular trenches. However, Italian tanks drove to the edge of the trenches and bombarded the defenders with machine guns, capturing the position. One of the most notable events in the battle was an Abyssinian cavalry charge against Italian troops advancing along the south bank of the river. Italian tanks rushed to their aid, and although the Abyssinian troops fought to the death, they were ultimately mowed down by the tanks' machine guns. At the same time, Italian aircraft bombed the Abyssinian army's rear formations to prevent reinforcements, and also bombed Nasibu's headquarters, though it is not yet known if they scored a direct hit. This battle is seen as a prelude to a major Italian victory. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Today marks the sixtieth day since the implementation of economic sanctions in Rome.

The press claims that the most significant phenomenon in Italy since the implementation of economic sanctions two months ago is the stability of currency and prices. Generally speaking, food prices have not risen at all. Price stability is a sign of currency stability, and currency stability is a sign of purchasing power. This situation also benefits Italy's foreign exchange considerably. According to exchange rates, the Italian currency has not depreciated in major markets such as London and New York.

<p>The semi-official Italian newspaper, Il Popolo d'Italia, recently reported that the budget expenditure for the fiscal year 1936-1937 does not include any item for war expenses against Abyssinia. All war expenses are derived from the following three sources: issuing treasury bonds; converting old government bonds with higher interest rates into new 5% government bonds; forcibly converting foreign securities and Italian securities issued abroad into Italian bonds or new treasury bills. From this perspective, the expenses of the East African war are purely funded by special treasury funds, and no additional taxes or levies have been imposed to increase the burden on the people.

Laval treated this as a matter of confidence and put it to a vote, which he passed with 315 votes to 251.

Upon hearing this news, Laval said that if other Radical Socialist cabinet members also resigned, he himself would consider resigning. However, in any case, he would still go to Geneva on Sunday to attend the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. During today's meeting of the Chamber of Deputies, a speaker from an independent socialist party criticized Laval's foreign policy, saying that Laval's advocacy of simultaneously allying with Great Britain, Italy, and Russia would achieve nothing. The speaker wanted the government to clearly announce its foreign policy before the general election and Laval's trip to Geneva. Laval replied that the Chamber of Deputies had already approved the government's foreign policy, so there was no need for this. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Tokyo Foreign Minister Hirota will make a statement on foreign policy to China and foreign countries on the day the parliament reconvenes on the 21st. This will be Japan's first expression of foreign policy after the breakdown of the naval conference, and it will also clarify its policy toward China before the Sino-Japanese Nanjing Conference is convened, attracting much attention from all sides. The main points of the Foreign Minister's speech are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Japan is the only stabilizing force in East Asia, maintaining an important position, which has gradually been recognized by various countries. The people should be determined to maintain this force and establish its position.</p>
<p>Relations between Japan and Manchukuo: The political and economic relations between Japan and Manchukuo are becoming closer and stronger due to the sound development of Manchukuo. Japan, in order to promote the development of Manchukuo, demands the adjustment of Sino-Japanese and Japanese-Russian relations.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Relations: There is no other way to establish friendly Sino-Japanese relations except to implement the three principles proposed by Japan. China has already acknowledged these three principles, which is most gratifying.</p>
<p>(According to a Dentsu News Agency dispatch, the three principles are: (A) China should eliminate its anti-Japanese attitude and genuinely strive for peace in East Asia, in which case Japan is prepared to assist China in seeking stability in East Asia; (B) improve Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo relations centered on North China; (C) prevent the Red movement, which is a major obstacle to peace in East Asia, etc.)</p>
<p>Japanese-Russian Relations: Japanese-Russian relations centered on Manchukuo have been further improved with the conclusion of the Sino-Eastern Railway sales agreement. However, regrettable disputes have repeatedly occurred on the Russian-Manchukuo border. The Japanese government, in order to adjust Japanese-Russian relations, is striving to resolve various outstanding issues between the two countries and believes that the withdrawal of the Far Eastern Red Army is the most effective measure and intends to negotiate this matter with the Russian side.</p>
<p>Naval Disarmament Conference: After the breakdown of the conference, the Japanese government continued to strive to maintain friendly relations with various countries. Japan firmly believes that the fundamental policy of the Japanese government will be approved by various countries in the future, thereby contributing to the establishment of world peace.

<p>New York Progressive Democratic Senator Wheeler, who has returned from a world tour, stated in recent days, "I know that people in the Philippines, due to the unrest caused by Japan and other situations, mostly wish the United States to continue to be their protector. However, I also believe that we have absolutely no reason to occupy the Philippines and should withdraw forever, because the Philippines has no value to the United States from a military or economic standpoint." Wheeler also said that the talk of a Japanese-American war is completely unfounded, because the Japanese are arrogant and do not accept any news that is unfavorable to Japan. However, if the United States does not purchase Japanese silk and does not sell steel and cotton to Japan, there is no danger of war. Great Britain hopes that Americans will retain the Philippines, intending to make the Philippines the last guarantee to prevent Japan from invading Singapore.

The governor's motive for granting the reprieve was not announced, but it is clearly due to new evidence or a new witness. The governor said, "Legally speaking, there are many reasons why I granted the reprieve. Personally, I have no doubt about Ho's guilt, but in the minds of millions of people, there are still doubts." The governor added that he currently has no intention of granting another reprieve. When he announced the reprieve, Attorney General Wilentz issued an opinion, saying that the governor had no such power because more than 90 days had passed since the verdict against Ho. The governor said that there were precedents for this matter, but once the news was released, there was a great deal of criticism from the outside. The Trenton Evening Times even ran the headline "Impeach Hoffman," and said that "the governor has sacrificed all his moral and legal authority in his office."

News of Ellsworth and his companion's survival was received here yesterday, but due to bad weather, many of the radio messages were garbled. Experts speculate that the aircraft No. 2 discovered the missing aircraft yesterday, but returned to the ship to report due to the fading daylight. This morning, they returned to the area and rescued Ellsworth and his companion. A subsequent telegram stated that a telegram received here this afternoon stated that aircraft No. 2 initially saw the missing aircraft 5 miles from Little America, and circled around for a long time before seeing Kenyon emerge from the aircraft.

<p>Reuters Special Commercial Report, January 17</p>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>British Gold: The London premium rose one penny today to 140 shillings and 11 pence.</p>
<p>British Silver: As expected, the London silver market rose .875 today to 19 pence. Speculators sold unanimously, but there were very few buyers. The market was stable when prices fell. Tomorrow is the settlement date for Bombay, so the position of the silver market is now approaching the final stage. The opening chips in London gradually decreased, but are estimated to be around 10 million ounces, so there is a need to replenish spot sales.</p>
<p>American Silver: The London silver price fell, so the Mount Airy silver market also fell accordingly at the opening. The March price was 42.00 to 50, which was 100 pounds lower than yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market was quiet this morning, with very little price fluctuation. The British-American exchange rate was 4.955625 at 10:30 a.m., which was .1875 lower than yesterday's closing price for American-British, but then rose .125 to 4.956875. This price did not change until 1:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>American Cotton: The New York cotton market opened steadily because it was heard that the representatives of the cotton-producing states had obtained the government's permission to not cancel the cotton subsidy plan that stipulates a price of 12 cents per pound. On the other hand, merchants were quite worried, feeling that the new cotton production control law would be difficult to establish based on the constitution. The opening price did not move, and then the price rose due to buying activity.</p>
<p>British Cotton: The Liverpool cotton market opened slightly lower due to long liquidation, and the market was quite apprehensive because people believed that the new cotton production control procedure under the American Agricultural Adjustment Act would be difficult to implement under the constitution.</p>
<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market opened steadily, expressing sympathy for overseas markets and because the shipping quantity was too small. At 1:00 p.m., the March price rose .75 to 6 shillings and 8.125 pence.</p>
<p>American Wheat: The Chicago wheat market was quiet because merchants were waiting quietly for developments in Washington. The May delivery fell .25 at the opening, and feed grains rose slightly. The opening price for May delivery was 60.125.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The London rubber market was quiet this morning, but prices were stable. At 1:00 p.m., the transaction price for April-June delivery was 7 pence, which was the same as yesterday's closing price.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Guangdong Students' Patriotic Movement: Guangzhou Declares Martial Law; Students' Parade in Lychee Bay Clashes with Anti-Traitors Corps; Primary Schools Also Affected, Temporarily Suspending Classes for One Week <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The student patriotic demonstration movement in Guangdong Province is expanding daily. Students from Zhongshan University are dispatching teams to various schools in the city to coordinate unified action, planning to suspend classes and embark on promotional activities. Two student demonstrations have already been discovered in Guangzhou. On the 13th of this month, a clash and brawl occurred between students and the Patriotic Anti-Traitors Corps in Lychee Bay. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lychee Bay Incident</p>
<p>Students from Guangzhou National University held a meeting at their school in Lychee Bay on the morning of the 13th, resolving to: immediately go on strike; request the school to waive the semester exams and grant everyone a passing grade; request the school to provide a promotional allowance of 200 yuan. After the meeting, undergraduates and affiliated high school students from Zhongshan University, along with students from the Municipal Second High School, arrived at the scene, joining the National University students in a parade. At that time, about 500 to 600 male and female students from various schools lined up and proceeded along Duobao Road from the National University playground. As the student procession crossed the Lychee Bay Bridge, a car suddenly approached, stopping abruptly at the side of the bridge. Over a dozen people in plain clothes got out of the car. One of them held a banner of the "Guangzhou Citizens' Anti-Traitors Corps" and rushed forward to explain something to the parading students. In the course of the conversation, a conflict arose. The two sides exchanged blows, and the order was disrupted for a time. Some students were squeezed and injured. The dispute lasted for forty to fifty minutes before the military police arrived to suppress it, and order was restored. Not long after, more than 200 students went to Xicun, intending to contact students from the Provincial Guangya Middle School. Before they reached the school gate, the second squadron of the school's volunteer corps was stationed inside. Upon seeing the students, they stepped forward to dissuade them. Fortunately, no further conflict occurred. Upon receiving the report, the authorities, fearing further incidents due to the continuous student demonstrations, declared a temporary martial law in Guangzhou City from noon on the 13th. The entire city was divided into four districts for management: 1. The Yantang and Shahe area was the responsibility of the Military and Political School. 2. The Henan and Dongshan area was the responsibility of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. 3. The Xiaobei, Sh Pai, Huangsha, and Xicun area was the responsibility of the Training Division. 4. Dongshan, Henan, and the city proper were defended by the Public Security Bureau's Security Team.</p>
<p>Students' Petition</p>
<p>After the Lychee Bay incident, a large group of students went to the Political Affairs Committee to petition. Chen Jitang and Zou Lu were present at the time and met with student representatives. In addition to reporting the events of the Lychee Bay incident, the student representatives also petitioned the Political Affairs Committee to: release the arrested students; punish the perpetrators who beat the students; and ensure the safety of students in the future. Chen and others promised to investigate the truth before taking action.</p>
<p>University President Resigns</p>
<p>In this expanded student patriotic demonstration movement, the students and faculty of Zhongshan University were the most enthusiastic. Unfortunately, an accident occurred. On the 13th, Zhong Da President Zou Lu sent another telegram requesting dismissal. At the same time, Fan Qi, Dean of the Faculty of Arts, Zheng Yanfen, Dean of the Faculty of Law, Xiao Guanying, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering, Deng Zhiyi, Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, and Liu Zuxia, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, jointly requested the university president to resign from the concurrent position of dean, citing that the student patriotic movement had gone beyond the proper boundaries, and that the deans had failed in their leadership.</p>
<p>Primary School Suspension</p>
<p>Students from secondary and higher schools have mostly suspended classes in recent days to engage in patriotic movements. Fearing that the city's public and private primary schools would be affected, they temporarily suspended classes for one week starting on the 14th, allowing primary school students to review at home in preparation for the semester exams upon resumption. A letter was also sent to the parents of primary school students, restricting them from going out during the suspension period.</p>
<p>Organizing Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>Since the authorities ordered the organization of the Patriotic Volunteer Corps, the captains of each corps (the dispatch of the general captain and three squadron leaders has been reported previously) took office on the 11th. On the same day, the corps headquarters was established, and a notice was issued to start registration. An independent squadron was also established, with Huang Bao appointed as the independent squadron leader. The independent squadron headquarters was set up at the old campus of Zhongshan University on Wenming Road. In addition, the General Headquarters dispatched five major service members to serve at the Volunteer Corps General Headquarters, taking charge of the work. However, in recent days, very few students have registered. According to the general captain, if students are enthusiastic about saving the country, they can register at each corps headquarters at any time to wait for training. If they do not serve, they can attend classes as usual. The organization of the Volunteer Corps is the same as that of the infantry, with four squadrons forming a battalion, and each squadron is set at ninety people (i.e., a company of ordinary infantry). The first step is to engage in unarmed training, and the second step is to issue military equipment for practice by the General Headquarters. The organizational regulations of the Volunteer Corps are as follows: To abide by the Southwest Political Affairs Committee's organization of the Guangdong Patriotic Volunteer Corps, specific organizational regulations are formulated for compliance. The Patriotic Volunteer Corps is composed of male and female students and faculty who are enthusiastic about saving the country. The soldiers of the Patriotic Volunteer Corps are composed of men, who are given strict military training and various combat exercises to cultivate the habits of hard work, endurance, and obedience. Women are organized into nursing teams, which are given appropriate military training and various battlefield rescue exercises, with the main emphasis on practicality. The Patriotic Volunteer Corps has a General Headquarters, with several battalions and squads under it, organized in the order of first, second, and third class. Officers at all levels are appointed or concurrently held by the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group. All school faculty and students who are genuinely enthusiastic about saving the country and willing to join the corps for training can register with each corps headquarters and wait for assignment. Soldiers are issued a monthly food allowance of six yuan, which is provided by the original school. Soldiers should abide by the same discipline as the military. Those who violate laws and regulations will be punished according to military law. These regulations will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Shanxi Province Establishes a Goods Reserve Depository to Purchase Agricultural Products and Aid Farmers and Workers; All Industries in the City Are Also Extremely Depressed <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Correspondence: Since the implementation of the legal tender policy in Shanxi Province, there have been no special changes in market prices. Regarding social finance, since the political changes in the 19th year of the Republic, Shanxi banknotes have plummeted, causing significant losses to the people, and their vitality has not yet recovered. In recent years, although efforts have been made to maintain the surface, the actual situation has been in a state of irreversible decline for a long time. Recently, the authorities have advocated the establishment of public land villages and the implementation of two major new policies of property securities. The future advantages and disadvantages of these new policies cannot be predicted. However, when these matters were advocated but not yet implemented, the people in various counties were indeed unable to borrow money and had no way out, finding themselves in a desperate situation. Most of the people usually regard land as a treasure for making a living, which can be cultivated to support themselves and can also be used to exchange goods. Most of the loans in rural areas are secured by land. Recently, after the method of returning land to public villages was spread, it coincided with the implementation of the legal tender policy. As a result, the current silver dollars that originally circulated were all hidden. The inherent ability of social economic activities had already lost most of its function. At the same time, land was no longer valued by people, and they held the idea that it would not belong to them. As a result, the economic situation of the people immediately showed a stagnant phenomenon. No one would lend money, regardless of the interest rate. Items worth hundreds of yuan, when pawned, even if you want to pawn one-tenth or one-twelfth of their value, are often rejected. The poor situation in various counties, although not unprecedented, is indeed unparalleled. Recognizing this, the authorities, in order to quickly raise relief, ordered the four banks publicly operated by the Shanxi Provincial Bank—the Sui-Xi Reclamation Bank, the Railway Bank, and the Salt Industry Bank—to jointly establish a "Goods Fully Prepared Depository." The four banks jointly raised funds to organize its establishment, purchasing as much folk agricultural and industrial products as possible for turnover. After many days of preparation, the depository officially started operating on New Year's Day this year, immediately sending staff to various counties, starting with the purchase of agricultural products. In the future, other items will be collected one by one. It is heard that in a few days, the amount of cotton and wheat collected has reached three to four million yuan, so grain prices have begun to rebound, and merchants and people also have a slight hope of escaping poverty. However, a distant source cannot quench a present thirst. Within the New Year, it is feared that the various counties in the province will not be able to universally benefit, which is regrettable. Yan Xishan personally serves as the general manager of the depository, and the funds are unlimited. It is predetermined that if there are certain goods and how much the demand for the goods is, the four banks will allocate that much. The provincial bank is responsible for 50% of the investment, the Railway Bank is responsible for 35%, the Reclamation Bank is responsible for 10%, and the Salt Industry Bank is responsible for 5%. Although these funds are all banknotes currently in use by the respective banks, the general merchants and people still consider it reasonable to have real goods as reserves. After the depository purchased a large number of agricultural products in recent days, grain prices suddenly rose. In order to balance the situation, the authorities telegraphed to the various branch depositories to sell at the original price, only increasing the handling fee by one-quarter of 35 per mille of the original price for expenses. They also plan to use the collected wheat to grind flour and sell it at a low price, and they are currently discussing machinery matters with the Jinfeng Flour Company and various flour mills.</p>
<p>The rules and contents of the Goods Fully Prepared Depository are as follows:</p>
<p>(Article 1) These rules are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations of this Depository, and are named the Shanxi Provincial Bank, Jinsui Local Railway Bank, Suixi Reclamation Bank, and Jinbei Salt Industry Bank Goods Fully Prepared Depository (hereinafter referred to as the Goods Prepared Depository). (Article 2) This Depository is located in the provincial capital of Shanxi.

(Article 3) In accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations, this Depository establishes commercial firms or entrusts commercial firms to receive various properties from the people. The required funds are borne by the Shanxi Provincial Bank for 50%, the Jinsui Local Railway Bank for 35%, the Suixi Reclamation Bank for 10%, and the Jinbei Salt Industry Bank for 5%. The aforementioned funds should be given to each bank by the depository at 2% of the issuance cost annually. (Article 4) The four banks that provide funds should jointly form an audit institution to audit the accounting and warehouses of the Goods Prepared Depository. If it is necessary to restrict the acceptance of the people's properties, it may also be restricted with the permission of the Economic Committee. (Article 5) This Depository has one manager, who manages the affairs of the Depository, and two assistant managers, who assist the manager in handling the Depository's affairs, and are selected and sent by the Economic Committee.

(Article 11) This Depository shall settle once in June and December each year, and the annual final accounts shall be prepared with the following books and tables and submitted to the Economic Committee for verification: balance sheet, property catalog, profit and loss statement, business report. (Article 12) If there is a loss after the final settlement of this Depository, it shall be compensated by the Economic Committee.

(Article 14) These rules shall be implemented from the date of distribution by the Taiyuan Economic Construction Committee.</p>
<p>The difficult situation in the counties is as described above, and the provincial capital of Taiyuan is also difficult to escape from this exception. Before the solar calendar New Year, officials and businessmen worked hard to maintain it. The Provincial Bank and other four banks borrowed hundreds of thousands of yuan from money shops to get through the standard year. However, now it is approaching the abandoned Lunar New Year, and various commercial firms still feel it difficult to cope. Recently, the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, at the request of the 22 guilds of various industries, submitted a request to the two Provincial Offices, requesting the official authorities to establish a real estate mortgage bank. After receiving the report, the two offices are currently studying the method. The original report of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce is as follows: "According to the chairmen of various guilds, since the currency reform, the current silver dollars in the city have been checked and sealed and cannot be used. However, the banknotes issued by the four major banks in the province, which are currently circulating in the market, are not sufficient for turnover. At this time of financial stagnation and commercial depression, the old Lunar New Year is approaching. If no measures are taken to relieve the situation, large and small commercial firms will inevitably collapse, and the impact on the market and local security will be significant. The Ministry of Finance is planning to establish a real estate mortgage lending bank and revise the real estate mortgage laws and regulations to revitalize the locality. It is proposed to imitate this meaning, and where merchants and people have real estate to mortgage for loans, they should be allowed to borrow from the four major banks at 50% of the market price of the property at that time, and issue the loan at a small profit, and return it on a regular basis. If this is done, the market can be slightly expected to be active, and not only will commerce be maintained, but real estate can be expected to be revitalized, and the four major banks can also receive a stable profit with real real estate as collateral. This is a triple benefit. The chamber is a representative of merchants and people, and does not dare to remain silent, so we report the situation in particular. If you are pleased to approve it, we implore you to order the four major banks to properly formulate measures and announce them for compliance, which is a virtue. All the reasons for the petition to the four major banks to establish a real estate mortgage lending are that we have something to do, and we should submit a document and ask for your approval and compliance. Respectfully presented by Taiyuan Pacification Director Yan, Shanxi Provincial Government Chairman Xu, and Taiyuan Municipal General Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Zhaotai." In the midst of the people's poverty and the exhaustion of wealth, and the decline of all industries, the results of the money industry's account settlement for the 24th year show a considerable surplus. The business conditions of the various silver money industries in the city in the 24th year, as investigated by the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce, are as follows: (1) The Provincial Bank's net profit was 400,000 yuan. (2) The Railway Bank's net profit was 600,000 yuan. (3) The Reclamation Bank's net profit was 50,000 yuan. (4) The Salt Industry Bank's net profit was more than 30,000 yuan. (5) The Hehesheng's net profit was more than 3,000 yuan. (6) The Xinghua Bank's net profit was more than 6,000 yuan. (7) The Jinyu Bank's net profit was 50,000 yuan. (8) The Jinxing Money Shop's net profit was 70,000 yuan. (9) The Renfagong's net profit was 120,000 yuan. (10) The Dexingchang's net profit was 5,000 yuan. (11) The Tongxiang Bank's net profit was 3,000 yuan. (12) The Yuanshengli's net profit was 11,000 yuan. (13) The Jinyi Bank's net profit was more than 6,000 yuan. (14) The Jinfeng Bank's net profit was 15,000 yuan. (15) The Deshenghou's net profit was 40,000 yuan. (16) The Yitai Bank's net profit was more than 6,000 yuan. (17) The Yihe Bank's net profit was more than 5,000 yuan. (18) The Yishuncheng's net profit was more than 6,000 yuan. (19) The Heji's net profit was 10,000 yuan.

(23) The Gongyi Trust's net profit was 10,000 yuan. (24) The Juyuantai's net profit was more than 3,000 yuan. (25) The Yushenmao's net profit was 8,000 yuan. However, most of the banks and money shops also engage in the sale of cotton, wheat, rice, and other commodities, which has exceeded the scope of remittances and loans (January 14).</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Ministry of Finance Replies to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: The Government is Determined to Consolidate Credit and is Planning Everything Carefully for Economic Recovery, Hoping to Sincerely Inform Merchants and People to Share This Intention and Not to be Exploited by Speculators, Causing Self-Alarm <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th: After receiving the telegram from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the 15th, the Ministry of Finance replied to the Chamber on the 17th. The full text of the Ministry's reply is copied as follows: "To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: We have read your deletion of the telegram. The government's efforts to consolidate credit have long been known to the world. In recent years, the national crisis has been severe, banditry has spread, rivers have flooded, and disasters have spread throughout the country. Moreover, it has been affected by the fluctuations of the global economic panic and the rise in silver prices, resulting in rural decay, industrial and commercial stagnation, financial exhaustion, and the depression of all industries. The Ministry, according to the appeals of various sectors, in order to save the crisis and restore the economy, implemented the legal tender policy to revitalize finance and give all industries the opportunity to develop equally. Therefore, the Ministry declared on November 4 last year that, regarding the major issues of improving the financial system, developing production, reducing imports, and balancing income and expenditure, the government will carefully plan everything that is beneficial to the people and is a necessary path for economic recovery, in order to meet the needs of the times, carefully consider, and selectively implement to strengthen the country's foundation and benefit the people's livelihood. The leaders of the association are expected to sincerely inform all merchants and people to understand that the government takes the interests of the people as its main purpose, and work together to achieve the goal of economic recovery. The speculative atmosphere in Shanghai has always been strong, and it has become a habit to focus on personal interests and confuse right and wrong. If you frequently request the government to express its views, it will not only be too much trouble, but it will actually be exploited by speculators. At this time when people's hearts are uncertain, you should not be tempted by those who seek temporary and selfish gains, causing self-alarm. Seal of Kong Shao, Minister of Finance."</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Issue of Various Shops Collecting Designated Banknotes Has Been Mediated and Resolved; However, Negotiations Are Still Underway with the Dalu and Donglai Banks; The Two-Year Term for Collecting Legal Tender is Canceled for Repurchase <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>New Voice News: Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated on November 4 last year that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender, various issuing banks canceled the method of collecting designated banknotes, causing opposition from the collectors. Now, except for the Dalu Bank and the Donglai Bank, the rest have been resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Centralized Issuance and Cancellation of Designated Banknotes</p>
<p>Various money shops and banks have a method of collecting designated banknotes, using 60% cash and 40% guarantee to collect designated banknotes, or using 100% cash to collect designated banknotes. However, the issuing bank will rebate the collector 40% of the guarantee interest, about 6% to 6.5% per annum, and the term for collecting the banknotes is two to three years. Since the Ministry of Finance announced on November 4 that the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications would be legal tender, the banks that issued banknotes, other than the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, are the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Siming Bank, the Commercial Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Fourth Bank, the Yih Bank, the China Agricultural Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank, etc. Because the power to issue banknotes has been centralized in the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, and further issuance is restricted, the Ministry of Finance has set a deadline to gradually exchange them back with Central Bank banknotes. Therefore, the method of designated banknotes has been canceled.</p>
<p>Three Banks Change to Collecting Legal Tender</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association and various money shops collect designated banknotes, with the Central Bank as the main one. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have decided that the method is to use 60% cash and 40% guarantee to collect designated banknotes. Association Chairman He Zhongxiao has agreed with the Central Bank and others that the method of collecting designated banknotes will be changed to collecting legal tender. The method is still to use 60% cash and 40% guarantee to collect legal tender, and the "repurchase" method will be canceled. The term is two years, and the money industry's joint reserve will collect and distribute it to member money shops, which has already been implemented. As for the member banks of the Banking Association, those who collect designated banknotes from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will also handle it according to the above method of collecting legal tender.</p>
<p>Various Shops Oppose the Cancellation of Designated Banknotes</p>
<p>The Heng, Li, and Zhen money shops, which are not members of the Money Industry Association, mainly collect designated banknotes from the Fourth Bank, the Commercial Bank, and the China Industrial Bank. Their collection method is to use 100% cash to collect banknotes, and the issuing bank will rebate 40% of the guarantee interest. After the Dalu Bank and other banks canceled the designated banknote method, they immediately organized a joint office for banknote collectors, arguing on the basis of reason. In addition to filing a lawsuit against the Dalu Bank in the First Special District Court, they also requested assistance from Du Yuesheng, Tang Shoumin, Chen Guangfu, Yu Zuoting, Hu Bijiang, and others to uphold justice, believing that although the issuance has been centralized in the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, the reserves paid by the issuing banks are also 60% cash and 40% guarantee, so the banknote collection method should not be canceled. It is reported that the total amount of banknotes collected by various shops has reached more than 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Agreed Method After Mediation</p>
<p>After Du Yuesheng, Tang Shoumin, Yu Zuoting, and others managed to mediate, the Commercial Bank, for the original contract for the collection of designated banknotes, will continue to be valid before the expiration date, but the actual amount collected by November 3 will be the standard, and the amount sealed and not collected will be reduced. The China Industrial Bank and other banks will also pay the interest on the 40% guarantee that should have been rebated last year. Now, only the Dalu Bank (note: the Dalu Bank collects Central South banknotes) and the Donglai Bank (note: the Donglai Bank collects Central Bank banknotes) have not been resolved. Tang Shoumin and Hu Bijiang are currently trying to mediate, and it is expected that it may be resolved before the end of various industries.</p>

The banking and money industries association, after receiving the order, has already sent separate letters to various banks and firms yesterday to implement it. The original text of the instruction is recorded below: Respectfully, we recently received Instruction No. 21773 from the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Approved based on the Shanghai Municipal Government's consultation, which stated, according to the Shanghai Land Bureau's report: It has been observed that capital circulation in this city has historically relied heavily on real estate certificates for buying, selling, and mortgaging. However, since the January 28th Incident, social finance has become increasingly stagnant, the market has declined, and all industries have deteriorated, almost to the point of collapse. The underlying cause is that the banking and money industries have refused to mortgage real estate in this city, making financial turnover impossible. Real estate certificates that were once active in the market have suddenly come to a standstill. If relief is not planned, how can recovery be achieved? Recently, since the central government implemented the legal tender system, some banks have handled real estate mortgages, but they mostly only accept perpetual lease deeds, and many land lots with land certificates are still unable to obtain financing. Treating the same land lot differently based on the type of certificate is unfair. In the future, citizens holding land certificates will not only be unable to utilize them, but also lose faith in them, which will hinder the Land Bureau's future certificate renewal efforts. On the other hand, this would be equivalent to increasing the value of perpetual lease deeds, giving them an opportunity to develop. In the future, people seeking mortgage convenience will flock to convert their certificates, which will have a significant impact on our country's land sovereignty. Moreover, the Land Bureau is actively carrying out land consolidation, and the effect of land certificates and perpetual lease deeds is no different. As the Director's duty lies in protecting our country's land sovereignty and facilitating social finance, it is necessary to prevent problems before they arise and urgently report to superiors. We respectfully request that the Minister promptly issue orders to the banking and money industries in this city that handle real estate mortgages, and forward them to the Ministry of Finance, instructing them to accept land certificates as much as possible for mortgages, with the same effect as perpetual lease deeds, to avoid discrimination and protect sovereignty, as it is in the public interest." Based on this, it is understood that the Land Bureau's intention is to rescue the market from decline and find ways to facilitate finance, while also increasing the credibility of land certificates and preventing the unauthorized conversion of perpetual lease deeds, which is very commendable. This can be implemented as is. In addition to instructions, we should also consult for assistance in accepting mortgages as much as possible to maintain the market. Regarding the enforcement of auction of mortgaged real estate in this city, the Land Bureau previously proposed alternative measures, which have been separately submitted for consultation. If approved, it will be even more beneficial to those who receive mortgages. This is hereby reported and we hope to receive a response." In addition to the Ministry's order to the Shanghai Land Bureau, ordering the Shanghai banking and money industry to accept the mortgage of city land certificates with the same acceptance as perpetual lease deeds, it is to maintain the effectiveness of city land certificates and revitalize the financial situation, and should be transferred by the Shanghai Banking Association to inform all banks and companies to investigate and handle. That the Land Bureau’s presented proposals regarding Shanghai’s mortgaged real estate to implement changes in the auction method, has already been summoned by the Executive Yuan to convene various related meetings for review, and after the Yuan has reviewed and approved, an order will be sent to the ministry before being delivered. This order, and so on, is hereby issued and should be transferred to all industries to investigate and handle accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Extreme Cold in This City Yesterday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Lowest Temperature 18.7 Degrees; Tap Water Also Frozen</p>
<p>Inland River Navigation Impeded; Drastic Reduction in Incoming and Outgoing Vessels</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter in this city, the weather has been mild, resembling the spring season. The cold gradually started in the afternoon the day before yesterday, and by nightfall, the weather was clear and extremely cold, with frost appearing. Yesterday morning, winter monsoon winds began to blow, and the temperature dropped sharply.</p>
<p>All-Day Freeze</p>
<p>The lowest temperature yesterday morning before sunrise was 18.7 degrees, 13 degrees below freezing. At 11:00 AM, it was 25.2 degrees. The highest temperature in the afternoon (around 1:00 PM) was 27.7 degrees. By 3:00 PM, it was 25.3 degrees. Afterward, the temperature gradually decreased, falling back to around 20 degrees, resulting in a complete lack of thawing throughout the day. Thick ice formed in streets and alleys throughout the city, creating a so-called "bottomed out" ice condition. There was slight melting around noon, but the ice quickly re-froze. Tap water pipes were also frozen.</p>
<p>Inland River Navigation Blocked</p>
<p>Due to the excessive ice, inland river vessels coming to Shanghai from inland areas were unable to operate on schedule due to the frozen rivers. For example, the Suzhou-Shanghai routes were delayed, and the Shen-Hu route also failed to arrive on time due to the ice. In addition, cargo ships on all routes were delayed, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of rice and vegetable ships arriving in Shanghai for trade yesterday. Furthermore, the monsoon winds that started yesterday morning subsided around 4:30 PM that afternoon and are expected to return today. According to astronomical observations, the weather should moderate after two days.</p>

It is now known that the student representatives have completed their mission in Beijing and took a train out of Beijing the day before yesterday, arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning. They are still staying at the East Asia Hotel. A Dagong News Agency reporter met with Liang Zuqiao, the Liaison Director of the delegation, yesterday. According to him, after the student representatives from Guangzhou arrived in Beijing, they petitioned the Executive Yuan, requesting a prompt determination of national policy. Secretary-General Weng received them and expressed acceptance of the points raised by the representatives, promising to forward them to President Chiang. President Chiang did not participate in a speech to the student representatives due to time constraints. Because the examination period is approaching, they urgently need to return to Guangdong. Therefore, they left Beijing last night for Shanghai and were originally scheduled to return by boat that day, but there were no available ships. It is now scheduled for the day after tomorrow (the 19th) and will still return to Guangdong on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan Wheel to report the petition process to the students.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Shanghai Land Bureau Announces New Method for Supplementary Land Tax and Price Payment Based on Supplementary Tax and Price Payment; Those Unable to Pay Can Repay in Installments with Added Interest <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Since the land survey in this city, it has been found that many households have a significant amount of land exceeding the amount recorded on their title deeds. According to regulations, they must pay the price and supplement the tax before they can obtain a certificate. Since the Land Bureau drafted the standards for handling excess land in June 1934, those who exceeded or occupied land by less than three fen and were unable to pay were temporarily allowed to use the land. As a result, the number of people paying the price has gradually decreased. Recently, it was heard that the Land Bureau has formulated measures for sorting out supplementary tax and price payment and making the land complete for landowners. The previous report has been recorded, and regulations and procedures have also been drafted for handling supplementary tax matters in the future. It has been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and announcement. The announcement and regulations are extracted below:</p>
<p>Announcement</p>
<p>Announcement by the Shanghai Land Bureau: It has been investigated that the standards for handling excess land in this city were revised in June 1934 and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and announcement. However, it has been found that the aforementioned standards for excess land have a provision that those who exceed or occupy land by less than three fen and are unable to pay may be temporarily allowed to use the land. Therefore, all landowners have requested to follow this precedent, and only a few have complied with the order to pay the price. Since the land survey in this city, it has been found that many households have a large amount of excess land, mostly scattered and fragmented. To make the land complete for landowners, supplementary tax and price payment should be the principle. If they are truly unable to pay the price, they may pay in installments over several years to make it easier. Therefore, after considering the situation, thirteen articles of the Shanghai Land Bureau's Regulations on Supplementary Land Tax have been drafted, and detailed procedures for handling supplementary taxes for additional title deeds and beach road base lands have been formulated and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval. These regulations and procedures are hereby announced to the people of the city for their information. Except for cases that have already been handled but not concluded before October 18th, where payment notices have been issued, they should be handled in accordance with the approved methods for clearing cases of supplementary land tax that have already been handled but not concluded, and for clearing cases of beach road land that have been completed but not paid. In the future, supplementary tax cases should be handled in accordance with these regulations. Furthermore, the standards for handling excess land in this city will be abolished from the date of this announcement. Be informed accordingly. Special announcement, January of the 25th year of the Republic of China, Cai Zengji, concurrently acting director.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Central Bank's Unlimited Buying and Selling of Foreign Exchange; Central Bank's Financial Weekly Publishes Report; Daily Newspaper Also Praises Successful Control <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the currency control system on November 4th last year, the unlimited buying and selling of foreign exchange has become more effective. Recently, the Central Bank's latest publication, the combined issues 2 and 3 of the Financial Weekly, details the process of maintaining foreign exchange rates by the Central Bank after the severe decline in London silver prices last year. Yesterday, the Japanese newspaper also praised the Central Bank's control effectiveness, which can curb Beiping speculation. A Huadong News Agency reporter urgently recorded the following:</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Rates Remain Stable</p>
<p>After the London silver prices began to plummet at the end of last year, the people of Shanghai were quite uneasy, and the demand for forward foreign exchange increased sharply, and the exchange rate gradually tightened. Later, because the national bank sold foreign exchange without limit at a selling price of one shilling two pence three seven five and twenty-nine and a half yuan, showing the fullness of foreign exchange stored in England and the United States, the Shanghai foreign exchange market loosened immediately. By the first day of the week (December 30), the public's belief in the government's ability to maintain the exchange rate increased, so the foreign exchange bulls had to sell at a low price or swap to February. On Saturday (January 4), the Central Bank announced that the swap price was still three thirty-seconds of a penny and three-sixteenths of a dollar, so the number of swap transactions between various banks and the national bank was quite large. This is the effectiveness of the national bank maintaining the currency system by selling foreign exchange at a fixed buying price. Since the beginning of the new year, this trend has become more obvious. The near-term British exchange rate has risen from one shilling two pence four six eight seven five to one shilling two pence and a half, and one shilling two pence five three one two five, and the US exchange rate has actually increased step by step from twenty-nine yuan eight seven five to nine three seven five to the buying price set by the national bank. When the national bank's weekly near-term exchange rate reaches one shilling two pence six two five and the US exchange rate reaches the buying price of thirty yuan, it should be purchased without limit. According to one week, the reason why the foreign exchange trend has turned loose is that, in addition to the bulls being impatient and selling off one after another, it is also due to the prosperity of export bills of exchange, and the special amount of foreign receivables due to the Lunar New Year. However, on January 10, the US exchange rate was relatively firm, and the actual foreign exchange market reached thirty yuan, which was caused by the sharp increase in the spread between the British and US rates. According to foreign telegrams, the decline in British and US exchange rates was caused by fears in the international financial market that the United States would devalue again, but since our country's new currency system has a fixed rate for foreign exchange, any change in British and US exchange rates will not affect the national bank. It can be seen from the government's control of foreign exchange that the national bank bought as much US exchange as possible at the buying price of thirty yuan at the end of the week. At the end of last week, it was reported that the government had banned foreign exchange speculation, but in fact the government had a clear order prohibiting improper trading of foreign exchange from September 8, 1934. Now that the government controls foreign exchange by anchoring, its success is better than restriction.</p>
<p>Daily Newspaper Also Praises Successful Control</p>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese newspaper also said that the success of the three banks in controlling foreign exchange is enough to curb speculation. A special excerpt is as follows: The control is successful, and the market is unusually idle. Since the Shanghai gold market soared to 1217 yuan in early November last year, it has been rising and falling, gradually showing a downward trend. By January 15 of this year, it had fallen to 1139 yuan and 80 cents, and on January 16, even with the swap difference, it was only 1150 yuan. In two months, it actually fell by about 70 yuan. After the national government implemented the new policy, Chinese businessmen and speculators were deeply uneasy about the control, so they worked hard to buy, which caused the gold market to soar. Unexpectedly, the government's control was unexpectedly consolidated, and in addition to the settlement of swaps before the Lunar New Year, the gold market fell by 70 yuan. As for the foreign exchange market, it also relies on the government's banks to adjust at any time, and the limits of one shilling two pence six two five for the British exchange rate, thirty yuan for the US exchange rate, and one hundred and four yuan for the Japanese exchange rate can still be maintained. In recent days, the British and US foreign exchange rates have been very favorable, and the market has been selling US exchange, but the Central Bank can still maintain it, so the market has been unusually idle in recent days, and the Lunar New Year is imminent, so I think there will be no major changes in the near future.</p>

<p>The Sino-Belgian Gengkuan Committee decided in a general meeting the year before last to allocate 3,000 yuan to administer university thesis awards. At the time, students in graduating classes from universities across the country submitted their work enthusiastically, resulting in a wealth of excellent pieces. The committee organized a judging panel which selected many winners, distributing a total of 1,700 yuan in awards. The remaining 1,300 yuan will be used to continue the essay competition this year. The committee's secretariat has already sent letters to various universities across the country. The official letter and essay topics are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Notice to All Schools: To encourage academic research, our committee decided in a previous general meeting to allocate 3,000 silver dollars as a university thesis fund for China. The selection of thesis topics and judging matters are handled by a sub-committee of experts appointed by our committee. The results of implementation in the 22nd year of the Republic were quite successful. This year, we will continue to use the remaining funds to administer the program. We have appointed experts who have proposed topics. In addition to publishing them in the newspapers, we are enclosing a copy of the thesis award regulations and detailed rules, as well as a copy of the thesis topics for each science department, for your school's reference. We hope you will announce this widely to all and maintain our public friendship. Sincerely, Chairman Chu Minyi</p>
<p>Thesis Topics: University Thesis Award Topics for the Second Session of the Sino-Belgian Gengkuan Committee. (A) Topics for the Department of Engineering Materials and Mechanical Engineering: Methods of mechanical power transmission on vehicles and in factories. Mechanical transmission of power on vehicles and in factories. What kind of primary power source is suitable for a factory with defense characteristics, and how should it be designed? Please discuss. (B) Topics for the Department of Agricultural Science (Cotton): The current state of the cotton industry in China and methods for its improvement. Cotton industry and national defense. (C) Topics for the Department of Physical Sciences: A catalogue and summary of physics papers published by Chinese physicists at home and abroad. A detailed description of various studies on the construction of the atomic nucleus. Raman Effect and molecular construction. (D) Topics for the Department of Law: The distinction and relationship between law and morality. Discuss the principles of law based on the establishment and revocation of contracts. What are the reasons that English and American scholars do not recognize the binding force of treaties, while the continent does? (E) Topics for the Department of Business (Accounting): An outline of cost accounting for spinning and weaving mills. Account books are tools for recording the increase and decrease of business owners' property, so the subject of bookkeeping should be subjective. Since the introduction of European and American value recording into China, the accounting subject has become the subject of journal entries, and thus has become objective bookkeeping, while the lending relationship of the business owner is often hidden and not expressed. However, the cash journal method of daily accounting, and the British-style asset and liability statement, are partly subjective recording methods. The common objective accounting method has failed to be consistent from beginning to end, while our country's inherent account books, although their form still has many shortcomings, have always used the receipt and payment of money as the subject of bookkeeping. All receipts are entered into receipts, and all payments are entered into payments, which is consistent from daily settlement to settlement report, is easy to understand, and conforms to the nature of account books. This is a unique feature of our country's accounting. Please study its theoretical and factual basis using scientific methods, and make a detailed comparison of subjective and objective bookkeeping methods.

<h3 id="e108">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Awaits Reorganization <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, since the directors and supervisors of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company successively resigned last year, General Manager Liu Hongsheng also submitted his resignation, but has not reported to the bureau. Although former Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua repeatedly approved and retained him, it was ultimately ineffective. After Yu Feipeng decided to act as the minister, Liu, together with Ye Zhuotang, visited Beijing at the beginning of the month to pay their respects. Although they received consolation, Liu expressed that he had no intention of returning to his post. When Liu returned to Shanghai, he convened a banquet for the standing directors and supervisors on the evening of the 13th to discuss the matter. Because it was heard that the Ministry of Transportation had drafted measures to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, mainly to abolish the director and supervisor system and instead have a general manager or director act alone, with one to two deputy general managers or deputy directors to be established separately. Therefore, it has been decided to telegraph the Ministry of Transportation to wait for the reorganization so that they can be relieved of their responsibilities. Currently, all parts of the bureau are preparing to handle the transfer procedures. As for the candidates for general manager, the Ministry of Transportation is currently drafting them. It is said that current Director Ye Zhuotang, former General Manager of the Ningbo Commercial Bank Sun Hengfu, and former Mint Director Zhou Peizhen are all highly acclaimed. As for the candidates for deputy general manager, there are also rumors of current Director Yang Zhixiong, Shen Zhongyi of Sanbei Company, and He Molin, Chief of the Business Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.</p>

<p>Last summer, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River successively flooded. The disaster was tragic and the affected area was wide, which can be called unprecedented. The China International Famine Relief Commission presented a report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and held a fundraising campaign for the Yangtze and Yellow River floods to provide relief to the victims. They spared no effort in appealing to domestic and foreign countries for donations. Those who were moved and generously donated huge sums of money were very enthusiastic, and many charitable organizations from friendly countries also embraced the enthusiasm to help their neighbors in disaster relief and gave their support, regardless of borders. It is estimated that no less than dozens of places have remitted donations for disaster relief. Yesterday, the Cuban Consulate in Shanghai received a donation of US$100 from the Cuban Red Cross Society for the Yangtze and Yellow River floods, equivalent to 330.58 yuan in national currency, which has been transferred to the Shanghai office of the China International Famine Relief Commission at 505 Henan Road, Jin Xing Building, for distribution on its behalf.

<h3 id="e113">Implementing Regulations on Prohibition of Opium and Drugs, the Shanghai Municipal Council Actually Expresses Opposition, Prosecution of Opium and Drug Cases Still Prosecuted Under the Old Criminal Law, Deliberate Steps Taken to Deal with the Court Are Incomprehensible <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>In order to implement the government's laws and regulations and ban opium and drugs within the time limit, the Shanghai First Special District Local Court has, since the 14th of this month, applied the two regulations on prohibition of opium and drugs promulgated by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently the Director General of Opium Prohibition to all opium and drug cases brought by the Shanghai Municipal Council under the opium crime provisions of the Criminal Code. Originally, those who operated opium and drugs and those who had opium and drug addictions in the Public Concession saw that the previous opium bans had been incomplete and that the government's laws and regulations were not implemented in the Concession, so they thought that this time would follow the same path and they were all at ease. Although some people applied to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for registration and licenses, less than one in a hundred did so. Now, the First Special Court has been able to overcome all kinds of difficulties and resolutely punish opium and drug offenders in accordance with the regulations, which is truly effective for the future of opium prohibition, and the opium addicts in the Concession must also have a sense of being punished. In the future, there will be no shortage of people who will automatically repent. Unexpectedly, at the beginning of this implementation, the Shanghai Municipal Council, which has the heavy responsibility of reporting, suddenly raised objections. The Council determined that the two regulations on opium and drug prohibition are not formal laws of our country, so the opium and drug cases handed over to the court by the police stations are still prosecuted in accordance with the opium provisions of the Criminal Code, but the judge said that the chapter on opium crimes has been expressly abolished by the government and is not applicable. Therefore, the punishment is meted out in accordance with the provisions of the regulations on opium and drug prohibition. However, the Council has now expressed its opposition and has drafted several countermeasures. It is said that its first step is that anyone convicted under the regulations on opium and drug prohibition will be directly sent by the court to the Caohejing Prison for execution, and the Council will not be responsible for enforcement. The second and third steps it has drafted are even more resolute. However, the central government's current opium prohibition policy has long been deeply praised internationally, which shows that the harm of opium and drugs is deeply hated by all sectors of the world. The authorities of the Concession have always been known for their wisdom, and their hatred of opium and drugs is no less than that of our government and people. Now, it is unknown whether there is a slight misunderstanding in prosecuting opium and drug cases without complying with the newly issued regulations. Otherwise, it would not hate what good people hate. It is expected that the misunderstanding will be eliminated soon and they will still be able to cooperate with the court. Therefore, no matter how difficult it feels, the court will never be discouraged.</p>

<p>Mr. Ding Wenjiang, a well-known geologist and director-general of the National Academia Sinica in our country, has passed away in Hunan. The colleagues of the Academy are deeply shocked and saddened. In addition to the president of the Academy, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, sending staff to Hunan to handle the funeral affairs, they also decided to hold memorial services in Beijing and Shanghai at the same time, and set up an academic scholarship to leave a permanent memory. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Memorial Service in Beijing and Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The memorial service prepared by the Academy is scheduled to be held simultaneously in Beijing and Shanghai at 2:00 PM today. Because Mr. Ding's will stipulates that no obituary should be issued and no mourning hall should be opened, the ceremony strives to be simple. In Shanghai, the auditorium is located on Bailinan Road. The office of the Academy has been newly decorated, and most of the mourners from all walks of life are from the academic community in this city. The order of the memorial service is as follows: Stand in silence, salute the portrait, silent mourning, chief priest offers flowers, read the eulogy, chief priest delivers a speech, report on affairs, family thanks, adjournment. It is heard that the chief priest is Cai Yuanpei, but Mr. Cai went to Beijing yesterday to preside over the memorial service in Beijing, so it was decided to send another representative to preside over the memorial service. The colleagues and councilors of the Academy in Shanghai will all participate.</p>
<p>Establish Academic Research Scholarship</p>
<p>In order to permanently commemorate Mr. Ding, the Academy decided to submit a report to the National Government for comfort in accordance with the regulations on school and educational staff funds, and because Mr. Ding devoted his life to academics, it was decided to establish an academic research scholarship to leave a permanent memory. It is also heard that the Academy will also hold a memorial scholarship for the former Director-General Yang Xingfo.</p>
<p>Cai Yuanpei Goes from Shanghai to Beijing</p>
<p>Mr. Cai Yuanpei, president of the Academy, took the night express train from Shanghai to Beijing on the evening of the day before yesterday (the 16th) to preside over the memorial service for Ding Wenjiang to be held in Beijing today. The position of chief priest at the Shanghai memorial service will be delegated to another person. Member Ma Yinchu, Luo Shishi, Secretary General of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and others transferred to the special train of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road at Nanxing Bridge and drove to Shanghai. They arrived at the North Station at 11:30 PM. Some of the Beijing and Shanghai journalists stayed in Hangzhou for a short stay and planned to visit for a day or two before returning to Beijing and Shanghai. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau still reserved the Qingtai Second Hotel as a dormitory. When leaving Hangzhou, they also prepared car seats. The road provided attentive reception this time, and the guests were very satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="e116">City's Construction Progresses by Leaps and Bounds: Major Buildings Completed, Museum and Library and Municipal Hospital All Completed, Municipal Shanghai Hospital to be Rebuilt by Tender <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Since the city's construction plan has been actively carried out, in addition to the central sports center, Zhongshan Road, and other villager residential areas, which have long been completed, other incomplete buildings have also been completed in succession. The prosperity of the city can be expected in the future. The details of the situation are explored and recorded below:</p>
<p>Museum and Library The construction of the Municipal Library and Museum has long been completed. The pedestrian walkways and water and electricity projects in the library have also been built and installed. Tree planting is currently underway. The construction of the library's book storage project has been contracted with a manufacturing factory and will start construction soon. The bookshelves are all made of iron frames, and the room's flooring will also be made of glass to make the light clear. The chairs and tables in the museum will be tendered for manufacture soon. Because of the need for theft prevention in the museum, the building is extremely strong. In order to make the indoor air circulate, a special machine is installed to fan the indoor air to facilitate circulation and avoid stagnation.</p>
<p>Municipal Hospital The construction of the Municipal Hospital and the Hygiene Laboratory has been underway since December of the 23rd year of the Republic. To date, more than one year has passed. The construction of the building has long been completed. Only the scattered projects in the pedestrian walkway inside the building are being built, and most of the equipment has been installed. The water and electricity projects for the two buildings amount to 460,000 yuan. The children's general wards of the Municipal Hospital are individually isolated with glass. The hospital's medical equipment and sterilizers are being made in the local business. X-ray machines, operating tables, operating room chairs, and other special medical equipment are all being ordered from foreign countries. According to reporter inquiries, the equipment is expected to arrive in early March and will be installed immediately. It is expected to be completed within one or two months and will be opened on a selected day.</p>
<p>New Construction The municipal authorities previously believed that the soundness of a city's medical equipment is closely related to the happiness of the people's health. Therefore, in addition to building the Municipal Hospital in the city center, the Municipal Shanghai Hospital on Duojia Road in Nanshi has not been able to achieve a thorough level in terms of equipment. Therefore, it is planned to rebuild the hospital. The drawings and various construction procedures are being prepared. In the future, after the construction is completed, all the layouts of the hospital will be similar to the Municipal Hospital in the city center, but the scale will be slightly smaller. The equipment must be perfect and will not fail to be a great municipal hospital in this city. The budget is about 100,000 yuan. The hospital will be tendered for construction in the near future, within one or two weeks. Other scattered constructions in the city center, such as the addition of a municipal primary school in the district, are said to be named the Municipal Yude Primary School. The drawings are currently being drafted, and the date of commencement is expected to be not far off.</p>

<p>At around 10:00 PM last night, a major fire broke out on Kangti Road in the French Concession, destroying more than 20 civilian houses and factory buildings. The French Concession Fire Department was fully dispatched to put out the fire, which has not been completely extinguished as of 1:00 AM this morning. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wind Boosts the Fire The Feijia Lane area behind Sideri on Kangti Road in the French Concession (east of the Sapo Hotel) is densely populated, mostly by coolies and workers, mostly civilians. There is a Republican Printing and Dyeing Factory, so half of the nearby residents work in the factory. At around 10:10 PM last night, a charcoal ball shop suddenly reported carelessness. At that time, the north wind was blowing, and the fire spread rapidly and was out of control. The first to bear the brunt was the Republican Factory. In addition, it was late at night, and the residents were all asleep. Because the area was secluded, the shops had already closed. When the fire spread, the first to discover it was only the owner of a fried rice shop.</p>
<p>Unapproachable</p>
<p>After discovering the fire, the owner of the fried rice shop immediately ran to the post office at the intersection of Sapo Hotel Road and borrowed a phone to call the fire department. At the same time, he frantically blew the police whistle. As a result, one whistle led to a hundred whistles, and the residents were awakened from their dreams. Seeing that the fire was out of control, they supported the old and carried the young, carrying boxes and bags, and fled in all directions.</p>
<p>Extinguished This Morning Within ten minutes, the fire departments from all roads arrived one after another. They first tried to melt the frozen hydrants by the roadside. There were a total of two pumper trucks, which fired at the same time. However, although the water pressure was strong, the fire was too big, making it difficult to put out. The fire has been shooting until about 1:00 AM this morning and has not been completely extinguished.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Introduces Yiwu Local Sugar <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the industry association yesterday, saying: Dear Sir, on the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the Chamber of Commerce of Fodang Town, Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, which stated that our county's local brown sugar has a long history and has gradually expanded in recent years, with an increase in production volume. It is estimated that the total production of the county is worth about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan per year, which is of great importance to the rural economy. However, because the traditional manufacturing methods are simple and crude, the products cannot be very refined and the sales are not widespread. This year, with the approval of the county government, our association strictly rectified the production, on the one hand, prohibiting the mixing of fake products, and on the other hand, guiding the improvement of manufacturing methods. As a result, the products are pure, high-quality, and have a good taste and color. The top-quality products are better than those from Taiwan. However, its price is much lower than that of Taiwan. This year, some sugar merchants in Shanghai and Nanjing have also purchased from Yiwu and said that they are suitable for use. If the sales can be promoted, it will not only greatly benefit the rural economy of our county, but also prevent the outflow of rights and interests and block a loophole for the country. The sugar industry is now on the market, and the production volume is particularly abundant compared to previous years. We are deeply afraid that the sales will be narrow and the production will be excessive, which will cause the people to suffer. It is a great responsibility to the government's intention to promote local products and revitalize the countryside. In addition to sending samples to the higher-level authorities to order all chambers of commerce to inform their members to assist in sales, we have enclosed a sample of goods and sent it to your association, approving the sending of the Shanghai Municipal National Products Department Store and informing your members to assist in sales to benefit the industry and save the countryside. We are very grateful, etc. With this approval, we will send a box of sample sugar to the product showroom of our association. We will also send a letter to you, hoping that your association will check and notify your colleagues to promote sales vigorously to help the industry and save the countryside, etc.</p>

Yesterday afternoon, the divorce case filed by Liu was scheduled for a continued hearing. The original two parties did not appear in court, and each of their lawyers appeared in court to apply for a postponement of two weeks in order to continue discussing a settlement outside of court. Judge Peng approved the request and ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the afternoon of February 5. If a settlement is reached beforehand, will apply for the case to be dismissed.

<h3 id="e123">City Federation Requests Funds from the Public Works Department to Aid Impoverished Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter yesterday to the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, requesting the allocation of funds to aid impoverished rickshaw pullers. The original letter stated: "Regarding the matter as reported by the Rickshaw Pullers Association of the Special District, since the Public Works Department stopped the registration of rickshaw pullers, those without registration are facing unemployment due to the regulations, affecting over ten thousand people. This year, due to the impact of social and weather conditions, business is exceptionally slow. The daily earnings, after deducting rental fees, still have to cover daily association fees of seven cents. It is difficult to feed a family. The purpose of establishing the mutual aid association is to assist rickshaw pullers. Now, at the end of the year, our impoverished rickshaw pullers have no way to borrow money, yet the association heartlessly refuses to provide assistance. This not only creates an imbalance in rights and obligations but also defeats the original purpose of mutual aid. Furthermore, the association collected a registration fee of 44,000 yuan during the rickshaw puller registration process. Therefore, we specifically request your department to negotiate with the Public Works Department to allocate funds to assist impoverished rickshaw pullers, etc." The matter was recorded and resolved at the Human-Powered Rickshaw Problem Research Committee meeting of this federation, requesting your department to allocate funds, etc. Therefore, we are sending this letter to you for your information and appropriate action.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Rickshaw Affairs Committee, noting that rickshaw pullers' armbands and licenses are often lost or that pullers switch to other professions, has issued a special notice to rickshaw pullers to replace their armbands and licenses. The replacements must be stamped by the committee, and the replacement dates are scheduled as follows: Numbers 1 to 5,000: January 15 to January 31; Numbers 5,001 to 20,000: February 1 to February 29; Numbers 20,001 to 35,000: March 1 to March 31; Numbers 35,001 to 42,000: April 1 to April 30. Furthermore, to thoroughly investigate the assaulting rickshaw pullers and prevent similar incidents from happening again, the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, upon the decision of the board of directors, has formed a special investigation committee, appointing Tao Deman, Jin Runxiang, and Yan Chengde as members, with Tao Deman as the convener.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Railway Bureau Orders All Stations to Inspect Air Brake Hoses to Avoid Delaying Train Schedules <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Each train car conductor should have one throat-nipple type air brake hose (female thread) and one throat-straight type air brake hose (male thread) available inside the car for replacement in case the hoses are damaged during the train journey. This has long been stipulated in the traffic regulations. However, recently, the Jin-Hu and Hu-Hang Railway Bureaus have found that the hoses kept inside the car conductors' cars are either damaged, incomplete in style, or not even prepared, so there is no way to use them when the rubber hose is damaged, delaying the train running time and hindering the safety of the train. For safety reasons, the Railway Bureau has decided that from January 13 to 19, station managers at Nanjing, Nanjing Jiangbian, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Maigen Road Freight Station, North Shanghai, South Shanghai, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Zhakou, and Gongchenqiao stations will inspect the rubber hoses stored at the stations one by one. Those that are damaged should be exchanged immediately for the straight-head and bent-head types. If the numbers cannot be averaged, then a list of the number to be replenished should be made out and claimed from the office. The ones in good condition will be tied up with rope, with one bent head and one straight head as a pair, and properly lead-sealed to prove they are in good condition. From then on, the following measures will be implemented: Each car conductor's car should have one pair of air brake rubber hoses. If the car conductor's car has no car conductor on duty, it will be kept by the rear car conductor. When the car conductor is on duty, he should first check whether the air brake rubber hose prepared in the car conductor's car is complete and in good condition. If it is found that the lead seal is lost, or the binding is loose, or there is suspicion of damage, he should immediately declare the replacement to the on-duty station manager. When the train arrives at the terminal station, when the station manager counts the air brake rubber hose, if it is found that there is evidence of use, the conductor on duty should be asked to explain the details, and the rubber hose should be re-inspected. The ones in good condition will still be tied and sealed according to the formula, and the damaged ones will be replaced. If there is a need to replace the air hose during the train journey, the conductor on duty should report the situation to the station manager at the terminal station and record it in the conductor's report. The damaged pipe that is replaced should be replaced with a new pipe by the conductor at the nearest stop that has the pipe. The air brake rubber hose should be kept away from moisture or fire.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Following the Assassination in Tong'an Lane, Several Notorious Robbers Were Arrested; The Deceased and Wounded Were Also Members of a Bandit Gang, Involved in Repeated Major Cases; Eleven People Were Arrested, the Case Is Complex, and They Are Detained for Investigation <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>On the night of the 9th of this month at 7:15 PM, an assassination occurred at No. 63 Tong'an Lane, No. 625 Medhurst Road, West Shanghai. At that time, several thugs armed with weapons broke in and fired seven or eight shots, injuring Yang Bangjie and Lü Zhenmin, two men from Jiangbei, who were inside the house. The murderers fled. The responsible police station was alerted and sent detectives to transport the wounded to Baolong Hospital. Lü Zhenmin died the next day due to his critical injuries, and Yang Bangjie's injuries were also severe. He remained in the hospital for treatment. It was also discovered that the injured were not good people. Therefore, in addition to stationing police to strictly monitor Yang Bangjie, his wife, Jin, was also arrested and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Now, it is known that after this case occurred, the Gordon Road Police Station paid close attention. For days, Chief Detective Zhu Mengwei, Zhu Hanbo, and Western Detective Leiter led detectives Pi Shaochang, Gao Huixian, and other detectives to investigate and obtained clues. They also learned that both the wounded and the deceased were members of a bandit gang who made a living by robbery and kidnapping, committing numerous crimes.</p>
<p>The reason for the shooting was</p>
<p>also due to internal strife among the gang members and unequal distribution of spoils. Therefore, the day before yesterday, many important criminals and principal offenders, both male and female, were successively arrested and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, requesting permission to detain them. Those included were: Yang Jin (Yang Bangjie's wife, arrested as mentioned above), Lü Chen (the deceased Lü Zhenmin's wife), and the wounded Yang Bangjie (i.e., Bangjie) was also listed as the third defendant. Chen Bishu (i.e., Chen Biyou, also known as Xiao Shuzi), Chen Dekuan, Qian Liu, Chen Liu (the mistress of Chen Dawei</p>
<p>who is on the run</p>
<p>), Liu Zuting, Liu Zuochen (only twelve years old, Liu Zuting's nephew), Qian Jinshan (also known as Qian Chuanzi, Qian Liu's husband), and Chen Dehong were all from Jiangbei. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the police station first came forward to explain the circumstances of the arrest, saying that the case was complex and that all the defendants were arrested yesterday, so the police station had not completed the investigation procedures and requested permission for detention. The second defendant in this case, Lü Zhenmin, was</p>
<p>arrested in the South City</p>
<p>and detained at the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, the mountain police station requested to take him back. On the one hand, Chen Bishu and Chen Dekuan were arrested near the Wusong Road Fire Brigade at 4:15 PM yesterday. The detectives then took the two Chens to Shilong Hospital, where the injured Chen Bangjie identified Chen Bishu as being present during the shooting and confessed that Chen Bishu and Wang Maoshu, who was on the run, had entered the room first, and the tenth defendant, Qian Jin, and Chen Dawei's son followed. Qian fired the gun. Later, at No. 51, Lane 31, O'Keeffe Road, six, seven, eight, nine, and ten</p>
<p>five men and women</p>
<p>were captured, and two gold watches, one gold ring, nine pawn tickets, contracts, and other items were seized. Chen Dehong, the eleventh defendant, was arrested on Changping Road. Another accomplice, Miao Tiankui, was arrested at the Shuanglongyuan Teahouse on Yokohama Road and is currently detained at the Public Security Bureau, requesting a document for his transfer. It was found that all the defendants in this case were members of a bandit gang who had been committing armed robberies in their hometown of Jiangbei for several years. Therefore, the first, second, and seventh defendants were all robbed by these people in Jiangbei, and their houses were burned down.</p>
<p>They were brought to Shanghai</p>
<p>as wives. In addition to finding out that the defendants had committed a robbery in the French Concession, stealing 6,000 yuan from a certain person on a chartered car, the police station also found a major kidnapping and ransom case on Yulin Road and requested a postponement, etc. When questioned, Lü Chen confessed that Lü Zhenmin was her husband, and that Chen Dawei's son, Qian Jinshan, Chen Bishu, and Dai Degui entered the room that day, and Qian Jinshan fired the gun. Chen Bishu confessed that he was</p>
<p>invited to Yang's house</p>
<p>by Qian Xiaolianzi that day to borrow money. However, two other people followed and entered and shot. Approximately six or seven shots were fired. The two men were wearing blue cloth shirts and pants, and he did not know their names. He heard the sound and fled in shock. Chen Dekuan said that he was wrongly arrested. Qian Liu said that Qian Jinshan was her husband and that she did not know about what her husband had done. Chen Liu said that she had a husband in Jiangbei but was robbed and brought to Shanghai by Chen Dawei's son and others</p>
<p>and forced to be a concubine.</p>
<p>Liu Zuting and Liu Zuochen confessed that they had just come to Shanghai from Jiangbei. Qian Jinshan denied being a bandit or shooting. Chen Dehong said that he did not know any of the defendants who were arrested. When questioned, Yang Jin confessed that she lived at No. 63 Tong'an Lane, Medhurst Road, and lived with her husband, Yang Bangjie. That day, Chen Dawei's son suddenly came and knocked on the door, pretending to be</p>
<p>looking for his wife</p>
<p>Chen Liu. After a while, he returned, and then Qian Jinshan, Chen Bishu, etc., followed him to the door of the stove shed where she lived. Qian fired a shot and shot Lü Zhenmin, then turned around and fled. Afterwards, she suddenly saw that her husband was also shot. According to her husband, he was shot by Chen Bishu, etc. Judge Liu approved the detention of all the defendants and will question them again on the 31st of this month. If there is no suspicion, a request for release should be made in advance.</p>

<p>The Poluo Coal Mine in Poyang, Jiangxi, was founded by Xie Hengzong and others, who are giants in the maritime media industry. The mine suffered extreme losses due to the repeated destruction by the Communist bandits and the kidnapping of important staff members, etc. Last year, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek cleared the Communist bandits, the mine hired Zhu Yonghe and Xie Yaozhilian as general managers and deputy managers, and the production volume increased day by day. In the past, the coal produced was only sold to various parts of Jiangxi Province. Now, there is a large surplus that can be shipped to Shanghai. It is reported that at the end of last year, the Huaxing Wheel transported 2,200 tons, and at the beginning of this month, the Fulong Wheel transported 1,809 tons. In the future, large quantities will be transported to Shanghai, which is very good news for the national mining industry.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Yu Jiesan Invents Fire Extinguishing Powder; Experimented Yesterday at the Public Sports Field; The Powder Extinguishes Fire Quickly and Effectively; Plans to Establish a Branch Factory in Shanghai to Produce the Powder <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Yu Jiesan, a native of Northeast China, invented fire extinguishing powder. Yesterday, he cordially invited representatives from all walks of life to conduct a fire extinguishing experiment at the Public Sports Field in Nanshi. Li Dachao, a representative from the Municipal Government; Wu Huanru, from the Social Affairs Bureau; Dong Zhihe, from the Fire Brigade of the Municipal Public Security Bureau; Wang Ziyao, a former staff officer of the Northeast Army; Shi Bingyan, the general manager of the fire extinguishing powder in South China; representatives from the South District Fire Brigade; and more than 2,000 spectators attended. The experiment started at 3:30 PM and lasted for half an hour. The process is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Experiment Process</p>
<p>In advance, a wooden frame measuring twelve feet square was erected in the Public Sports Field in Nanshi, with wooden strips nailed on it and covered with waste paper. At 3:30 PM, representatives from all walks of life arrived. First, a photo was taken, and then a technician poured kerosene on the wooden frame and ignited it with fire. In an instant, the raging flames soared into the air. Because the wind was very strong yesterday, even though it was only a square foot of land, the smoke reached the sky, and it looked like a single building was on fire. Then, two people held fire extinguishing powder and vigorously sprinkled it on the blazing fire. The fire was extinguished and the smoke dissipated where the powder landed. In a few seconds, it was completely extinguished. The representatives then dispersed amidst the applause of the audience. It is indeed a very agile fire extinguishing tool.</p>
<p>Inventor's Remarks</p>
<p>According to inventor Yu Jiesan, the reporter said that he was formerly from the military. After resigning, he lived overseas. When traveling in Japan, he felt that the fire extinguishers in that country were very effective and was very interested in seeing the fire extinguishing powder. He bought several cans and brought them back to China. He studied them carefully, expending all his energy, but could not find the secret. So, he bought British and Italian fire extinguishing powders for comparison, analysis, and experimentation before discovering their chemical effects. He studied them even more and finally succeeded. He was originally from Northeast China and had a meager fortune. Due to his research on this fire extinguishing powder, his family property was exhausted, costing him a total of 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. Later, when the powder was completed, with the help of friends, he set up a factory to produce and sell it, naming it Zhengda Fire Extinguishing Powder. On the one hand, he registered the patent with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and on the other hand, he set up a factory to promote the products. At present, in South China, he is trying to promote it. There are currently three manufacturing plants in North China, one in Pingji and one in Zhangjiakou. The total number of employees is about 600. It is planned to set up a branch factory in Shanghai in the future to strive to stop the most unfortunate fire in the world. As for the properties of the powder, it is harmless to the human body, even if it enters the mouth. Because the largest component of its powder is made of baking soda, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Chen Dimin and Wife Reconcile and Separate Settlement Established <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Chen Dimin, a wealthy businessman from Anhui residing at No. 379 Beile Road in the French Concession and the owner of Lafaytte Apartments who once worked as a compradore for a foreign company, is currently 44 years old. He married Tan Kunfan, a woman from Suzhou, in his early years. They have been married for 20 years and have five children: two sons and three daughters. Because Chen took a concubine outside, opinions occurred between the husband and wife. On February 27 of last year, they argued and Chen assaulted his wife, injuring her corner of the eye. His wife, Chen Tan Kunfan, believed that her husband had become abnormal and tyrannical and could no longer live with him. She took the children and returned to her mother's home. She also reported Chen's injury to the French police. The police department filed a public prosecution against Chen with the Second Special Court. After two trials, Chen was fined. Chen Tan Kunfan then hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to file a separate settlement lawsuit against Chen Dimin in the civil division of the Second Special Court and requested the return of 700 yuan per month for nine months of living expenses away from home, totaling 6,300 yuan, and a loan of 3,000 taels. The court approved the motion. After Judge Li Liang held several court hearings and summoned witnesses, the defendant Chen Dimin appointed lawyer E Sen to defend him. The court advised the two parties to negotiate a settlement outside of court and rescheduled the hearing, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, both parties and their lawyers were summoned to court again. Chen's elderly mother and relatives of both parties, both male and female, also attended the hearing. First, the plaintiff's lawyer submitted a paper outlining the terms of the settlement, totaling seven items. After the court reviewed them, the opinions of the plaintiff and defendant were found to be different and not yet close. After the court painstakingly advised both parties for two hours, explaining each term of the settlement, both parties finally agreed to the terms of the settlement. The main points were: (1) The defendant agreed to the plaintiff taking the children and separating for four months. After the period, the plaintiff would take the children home to live together or form a separate small family. (2) During the separation period, the defendant would pay the plaintiff living expenses (including rent and other expenses for the children) totaling 370 yuan per month. (3) The children's education expenses would be borne by the defendant. (4) The defendant admitted to the plaintiff's expenses for the ten months away from home (i.e., the 6,300 yuan sued for) as 4,000 yuan, and would repay it with money whenever it was available. (5) The plaintiff abandoned the 3,000 taels loan lawsuit, and the defendant agreed to give the plaintiff 4,000 yuan if there was a profit of over 10,000 yuan from the sale of property in the future. (6) The defendant would give half of the Lafaytte Apartments property to the children, managed by the defendant and supervised by the plaintiff. (7) During the separation period, the plaintiff could take household items for use. Finally, the plaintiff stated that she had borrowed money for use since leaving home and needed money to pay for the New Year and pay the interest on the loan, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 500 yuan in advance. The defendant said that his financial situation this year was very difficult and he could only pay 100 yuan first. The two parties insisted that the amount could not be resolved. The defendant then increased the amount to 200 yuan. The plaintiff said that this amount was not enough to spend and use. After the court advised him, the defendant was ordered to pay 200 yuan before the lunar New Year and another 200 yuan on the second day of the lunar New Year. The plaintiff then agreed. The clerk then made a written record of the settlement, which was signed by both parties and their lawyers, and they left the court. A husband and wife lawsuit came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Progress of the Sino-Western Pharmacy Is General <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>In this year of economic downturn, all industries are in decline, bankruptcies are common, and it is even more difficult for new pharmacies to maintain themselves in the face of competition from imported products. However, the Sino-Western Pharmacy on Fourth Road is uniquely issuing dividends ahead of schedule at this time, and one cannot help but admire the pharmacy's spirit of struggle. Yesterday, a reporter visited Mr. Zhou Bangjun, the general manager of the pharmacy, who said that under the leadership of Chairman Chu Minyi, the pharmacy's business has increased year by year. On the one hand, it relies on the support of the Chinese people, and on the other hand, it depends entirely on the mutual assistance of the industry. Last year, the decline in the market became more apparent, so two major policies were set for implementation: (1) The improvement of existing medicines and fragrances and the increase of new products. In addition to the existing pharmaceutical personnel, eight experts were hired last year to be responsible for this task. (2) The improvement of promotion work. A part is responsible for internal work, and a part is dedicated to mobile work. Personnel are sent to Suzhou, Zhejiang, Shandong, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei to conduct investigations, and the products with the largest sales volume are Star Magnolia Perfume, Tan Di, Wei Yao, Vitamin, Wheat Essence Cod Liver Oil, and Nine Star Milky White Cod Liver Oil. Currently, there are four branches in Shanghai: Jing'an Temple, Zhejiang Road, Dongmen Road, and Laoximen. This year, there are plans to set up a branch in the Great World. The decision to issue dividends ahead of schedule was decided by Chairman Chu Minyi calling a joint meeting of the board of directors and supervisors, and all colleagues were given salary increases and dividends to encourage them. The Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, which has been preparing for several years and specializes in the manufacture of special medical drugs and injections, has already produced dozens of types of capsules and pills last year, and this year's plan has also been set and will be implemented gradually. The pharmacy's retail department has been crowded with customers for several days, which is more lively than the four major companies. The staff treats customers with great humility, which shows that the development of the pharmacy is not accidental.</p>

<p>The Bank of China plans to build an eighteen-story mansion. The model has been made by the engineer designated by the bank, and the style is very novel. According to reporters' inquiries to the bank yesterday, the location of the new mansion is still on the original site on the Bund, and the area has been expanded by more than half. It faces Huangpu Beach Road to the east, Museum Road to the west, Renji Road to the south, and Jardine Matheson to the north. The estimated construction cost is four million yuan. Piling and other works are currently underway. It is said that the model drawings of the mansion will be submitted to the board of directors for review after the bank studies and determines them. It is expected to start construction in April and will take two years to complete.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Both Railway Bureaus Approve Track Inspectors and Police to Use White Signal Lights at Night; Both Army Armored Vehicle Battalions Have Been Notified <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Track inspectors and police on the Jin-Hu and Hu-Hangyong Railways previously used green lights at night to indicate safety signals at the request of the armored vehicle teams to make it easier to identify people moving along the tracks. The Traffic Safety Committee of both railways believes that from the perspective of railway operation, there is no need to display safety signals everywhere along the line unless there are obstacles. Conversely, in the event of an accident, track inspectors and police can follow the regulations to display temporary danger signals so that trains can stop safely. Now, the green lights displayed by track inspectors and police along the line at night have nothing to do with traffic safety. Within the station boundaries, they are confused with the signals of the trackmen, making them difficult to identify. Therefore, it is planned to order track inspectors and police along the entire line to use white lights at night to show the difference, indicate safety, and provide a warning. This has been approved by the two railway bureaus and the Second Company of the Army Armored East Detachment has been requested to notify the district teams stationed along the two railways.</p>
<p>###祥生 Taxi Company to Face Strict Crackdown</p>
<p>Since the municipal government and various bureaus and departments moved to the city center, citizens traveling to that area have had to hire taxis. Regarding the issue of fares, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau had already convened a meeting with representatives from various bureaus and departments to decide that for taxi companies establishing branches in the city center, taxis traveling from anywhere within the city (except Caohejing) to the city center would charge a flat rate of one yuan per one-way trip. At that time, Mr. Zhou Xiangsheng, manager of the Xiangsheng Automobile Company, was also invited to attend as a representative of the trade association. He expressed his willingness to comply with the decision on the spot. Subsequently, the company applied to establish a branch on Guohua Road, and the bureau approved it. However, after receiving the license, the company then published an announcement stating that the fare was one yuan, limited to twenty minutes, and that charges beyond that limit would be handled according to industry regulations. The bureau considered this announcement to be a reversal of the previous agreement and immediately ordered a correction. The company also responded with a submission stating that it would comply. However, the Public Utilities Bureau continued to receive reports from various sources that the company was not following the regulations. In reality, it still charged one yuan and five jiao for a single trip, and there were also instances where the company refused to dispatch cars when requested by phone. After investigation, these facts were confirmed. Considering the company's disregard for regulations, a plan to crack down on it was being considered. Suddenly, the company published another announcement canceling the Guohua Road branch and stating that the minimum fare for hiring a car to the city center would be one yuan and five jiao. In order to conduct a fair and thorough investigation, the bureau sent personnel to join with staff from the Public Works Bureau to hire Xiangsheng taxis for three trips: first, from the intersection of Yangshupu Ningguo Road to Zhaofeng Park; second, from Xujiahui to Ningguo Road; and finally, from Ningguo Road back to the city center. The first two trips took 29 and 27 minutes respectively, with each trip exceeding twenty minutes and covering eight to nine miles. The company charged only one yuan for each. However, the last trip, from Ningguo Road to the city center, took only fifteen minutes, covering only four miles, but the company charged one yuan and five jiao. After receiving these reports, the bureau convened a meeting with various bureaus and departments of the municipal government. The company's claims of high gasoline prices and violations of industry regulations were deemed to be mere excuses and attempts at deception. This behavior was considered to be a major hindrance to the construction of the city center. All bureaus and departments agreed that the company had made a prior commitment but repeatedly reneged on it, abandoning its promises and disregarding regulations, and that strict measures should be taken. It is reported that a plan for a crackdown has been agreed upon and will be implemented soon.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Electrical Manufacturing Association Announces Cancellation of Patent for Silver Light Bulbs <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing Industry Association has issued a notice to electrical manufacturers nationwide regarding the cancellation of the patent for silver light bulbs. The notice states that the association has received letters from member factories inquiring about whether they can imitate the silver light bulbs. After investigation, the silver light bulb is simply a renaming of the silver-plated light bulb that has been available in Belgium for two years. Previously, Mr. Wang Meiqing and others had raised objections with the ministry regarding this, and on December 5th of last year, the ministry approved the objection, canceling the patent granted to Li Qingxiang for the so-called invention of the silver light bulb. Therefore, all factories are now free to manufacture silver light bulbs. This notice is specifically issued to inform all colleagues nationwide of the truth.</p>

<p>In today's edition of your newspaper, there was a news item stating that the rental dispute at Sida Lane on Siccawei Road has been resolved. The names of the representatives listed are not in accordance with the facts. The representatives of the tenants of Sida Lane who negotiated with Mr. Qiao Rusheng, the landlord's representative, were Mr. Niu Yuzhen, Xu Shaoshan, Chuan Yongnong, and Lin Canxun. There was no Hu Huang present. We hope you will make a correction. We are eternally grateful.</p>

<p>On the 7th, your newspaper's local news reported that Maochang Cotton Cloth Store was threatened with extortion by a bandit named Shi Songlin. The criminal confessed to living at No. 200 Zhujia House, Chengdu Road, in Shanghai, which is extremely alarming. After investigation, No. 200 is my property. Apart from renting to Qian Yinchang, the rest of the house is occupied by my family. There is no one with the surname Shi. The police have investigated and found that the report is inaccurate. We hope you will make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing on behalf of my client, Ms. Shen Shuqing, who has informed me that recent newspaper reports about a theft case at Minhua Primary School have implicated her in many ways. The Shanghai First Special District Court has now ruled, sentencing Ding Jia to three months in prison, suspended for two years, finally revealing the truth. However, Ms. Shen has served in the education sector for many years, and this lawsuit has damaged her reputation. She has commissioned this lawyer to file a lawsuit. The facts are as above. We respectfully request that you make a correction to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Lawyer Chen Xingmin</p>

<h3 id="e143">Western Football Association Revises Important Rules <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>No more than ten teams per league from next season. Revisions to the rules for the Junior Tiffin Cup tournaments. The Senior Cup competition is expected to resume next season.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football Association recently issued a notice from Secretary Sipeke to member teams stating that the association's various rules were carefully discussed at a committee meeting held on the 20th of last month. Revisions were made to the issues of promotion and relegation of members in each league, as well as the association's articles of association, league rules, and cup competition rules. The new rules will be implemented starting next season.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the number of teams and promotion/relegation: At the end of each season, the two teams with the worst performance in each league, except for the First Division (who can still join their current league in the next season), must be relegated, while the two best teams can be promoted to the higher league. At the same time, starting from next season, the number of competing teams in each league shall not exceed ten, and there shall not be two teams with the same name in each league.</p>
<p>Start of the season and organization of the executive committee: The start of each football season was originally set from October 1st to March 31st of the following year, as stated in Article 16 of the association's articles of association. This article has now been revised by the committee to start from the last Saturday of September each year and end on the second Saturday of April of the following year. The organizational law of the Executive Committee in Article 14 has been revised to form an Executive Committee consisting of four members selected by the officials of the Western Football Association, three members of the association, one member of the British Army or British Navy, and one member of the Referee Association. Five committee members will constitute a quorum. The addition of one member from the Referee Association is new and was not present in the original articles of association.</p>
<p>Second Division can select four "floating players": Article 6 of the league rules has now been amended to read, "Any team participating in the league with both First and Second Divisions must select four 'Floating Players' from the Second Division and register them with the secretary of the Western Association. These four floating players can participate in matches in any league without further approval from the committee." The original article stated that any player who has participated in more than three matches in the First Division during the season cannot participate in the Second Division again, unless specially permitted by the committee. This restriction has now been removed by the amendment. However, as these four "floating players" are selected from the Second Division, there are still restrictions on the participation of First Division players in the Second Division.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the level of participation in cup competitions: The Western Association Senior Cup has been held only four times since it began in 1927, and was suspended in 1931. It has now been four years since it was held, and the Western Association plans to revive it next season. This committee has made revisions to the rules for the Senior, Junior, and Tiffin Cups. Article 2 of the Senior Cup rules originally stated that "all members of the Western Football Association who have not joined the league can join". It has now been revised to read "The Senior Cup competition is only open to teams in the First Division, with the winner determined by an elimination system." Article 2 of the Junior Cup rules originally stated "Only teams from the Third and Fifth Divisions and members of the Western Football Association who have not joined the league can participate." The original text of Article 1 of the Tiffin Cup rules, "All teams except those in the First Division can participate," has also been revised to read, "Only teams from the Second and Third Divisions can participate." At the same time, in Article 2 of the rules, the restriction "Players participating in the Tiffin Cup competition are not allowed to participate in the Junior Cup competition" has been added. The original text of this article was "Players who have participated in more than three matches in the First Division cannot participate at will."</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Poor Nat, having suffered this setback, suffered a spiritual wound that would never heal. He felt that he had not only lost his partnership and protector, but also that his personality had gone bankrupt, and that he had lost his identity in the trading arena from then on. No one could trust his words anymore, whether spoken or written, even if he tried his best to redeem his past hypocrisy; the sign had been taken down, the company had been dismantled, and he was a fallen and ruined man. That warehouse, – the Wall Street of the children (note) – no longer knew Nat’s name. Wrinkled Forehead and her several sisters cried earnestly, as if wanting his favor, yet he finally did not come, and seemed to truly sympathize with his misfortune, because the eggs laid were decreasing day by day, and several chickens were annoyed, and retreated to new nests that Tom could not find.</p>
<p>Nat heard this news and said, "They believe me;" although several children who heard it sneered, Nat used it to comfort himself, because when a person is down on his luck, even the trust of a speckled old hen feels extremely comforting.</p>
<p>However, Tom did not look for a new partner, because suspicion had seeped in, and the previous intimacy of confiding in each other no longer existed. Ned expressed his willingness to partner, but he also declined, and the fair attitude in his words showed that he was indeed a man of integrity. He said:</p>
<p>"Maybe it will be discovered that Nat didn't take the money, then we can partner again. I think this is unlikely, but we have to give him a chance and leave this position open for a little longer."</p>
<p>(Note) Wall Street is the area where New York bankers gather daily, holding the reins of American commerce; it is used here metaphorically.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Finance: Silver Bull Market Breaks Through 20 Pence Barrier; Standard Silver Makes Steady Progress; Briefly Breaks 70 Yuan Barrier; Ultimately Soars 17 Yuan; Bulls Exceed 34 <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw a surge in buying interest as spot silver broke through the 20 pence barrier, disappointing the shorts. Coupled with the Commercial Bank of China’s frantic purchases of US dollars, prices soared to over 70 yuan before becoming erratic. In the morning, the overseas silver market saw contractions in both the UK and US, leading to the expectation that spot silver would fall. It was said that after the market closed, the US Treasury Department purchased a portion of silver in its sales quantity at the listed price, but there were still sellers at around 0.1875 below the listed price, with no buyers. Forward silver prices in Monterrey fell between 0.09 and 0.015. Exchange rates contracted slightly. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The public's sentiment was bullish, as silver had broken the 20 pence barrier, and pessimism about crossing the barrier further fueled buying interest. When the over-the-counter grey market opened, it immediately rose to 52.53 yuan, with Chun Yuan, Yong Shun, and Mao Lai entering. At this time, the market was balanced with buyers selling and supply was lacking. Chun Yuan, Yong Shun, Mao Fu Xing, Yong Ri, Chang Da De Cheng, Hui Xiang, Heng Jing, Yong Ding, Kang Li, and Feng Ju advanced, rising gradually. Buying interest was at its peak. The People's Bank of China’s listed rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard silver price was listed at 1145.2 yuan, with little impact. The morning opening was the highest, and although there was some downstream selling after the opening, the buyers were eager to buy at lower prices, allowing the price to rise. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation’s listed rates were announced, with both the UK and US unchanged. There was considerable fluctuation at this point. Later, the Commercial Bank of China and others frantically purchased US dollars, boosting public sentiment and breaking through the 60 yuan barrier, continuing to report gains. The silver balancing tax was announced to have fallen by 0.0125 (only 4% being levied). Although there was a small setback after the high, the exchange market was still difficult to ease, buying interest was easily ignited, the trading floor was dry, and the situation remained strong. Major players rushed to buy, briefly approaching the 70 yuan barrier. Banks took advantage of the high prices to sell slightly, and suppliers were active at the high prices. There was a temporary dip, but public sentiment remained strong. The upward trend continued at midday. In the after-hours market, although there was a slight setback from over 70 yuan, buying interest remained strong, and the price finally rose to a high of 72.4 yuan. Banks sold in droves. Reuters reported that the US House of Representatives was scheduled to meet on the 17th to discuss raising silver prices, which immediately triggered a sell-off, falling back almost 10 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange market prices encountered extraordinary changes, and rumors such as interest rate cuts and extensions became more and more true. Since the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Beijing, and then telegraphed again to urge representatives of the financial community to go to Beijing to participate in the meeting, the market has been filled with suspicion. The short side took the opportunity to fabricate rumors, and they seemed to be getting more and more vivid, giving the impression that it was inevitable. Although the actual results are currently impossible to speculate, this matter is of great importance and is extremely important to the assets of the financial community. The market price fell, and the losses were substantial. The reduction in interest rates was even more important. If the speculators deliberately played tricks, the backlash would also be very large. This is the only great reason for retail investors to buy. However, the reporter found that large short positions were not covered, and there was little hope of recovery. Although the bullish side felt unusually painful at this time, if arbitrageurs did not swap and cover their positions, it would be enough to stir up great waves. Today's market will still have very large changes, and if there is another sharp drop, there will be a recovery. Yesterday, only two trading sessions were held in the morning and afternoon. In the morning session, the decline was very large, and the market was full of selling. Numbers 4, 6, 21, 33, 43, 48, 54, and 78 were all selling. There were very few buyers, and retail investors were very active in buying. The short-term gold bond plunged 2.4 yuan, and the market situation was terrifying. In the afternoon session, which was delayed until after 4 o'clock, number 19's kindness plunged by as much as 1.85 yuan, but retail investors were scarce. Only numbers 5 and 43 absorbed and number 34 sold more. Numbers 20 and 48 sold less, and numbers 3, 33, 35, 71, and 78 all had buyers, resulting in a recovery of 0.4 to 0.6 yuan in uniform tax and short-term gold bonds. After entering the market, there was still a drop of several points. The market price finally fell by a few points to 2.55 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 30 million yuan. The results of the comparison of the ups and downs are listed on the left (unit: yuan).</p>

Ordinary giants' stocks were very sluggish, and speculators were waiting and watching, but the long-term outlook was still optimistic.

<p>The gauze market continues to rise, silver has greatly shrunk, and the long-dull marked gold suddenly announces an upswing, stirring up people's hearts. Speculative activities and short covering occur in the air, while Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton Yarn also steadily increase. This is actually an absorption of financial prices. Things remain centralized, and a rising trend is likely to start with any good news.</p>
<p>Short Covering Drives Up Marked Gauze</p>
<p>At the opening of the marked gauze market, the marked gold pushed higher. People's hearts were tense, and sellers were scarce. The market price rose uniformly across all months. Changfeng closed out long positions, Run Kang covered short positions, and other transactions were exceptionally quiet. As a result, each month rose by one yuan to one yuan, six, seven, eight jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, it jumped horizontally by one yuan. It was heard that the marked gold continued to rise, igniting buying momentum. Osaka's Three Grades of Yarn also announced a rise. Unexpectedly, after the second round of bidding, the marked gold news retraced from a high price of five or six yuan. Changfeng spat out 500 bales in the first round for the current month. Tongcheng Company's long positions emerged in large quantities. As soon as the chips loosened, it suddenly fell by one yuan and three jiao. Distant months were hit and retreated uniformly. The closing was also ordinary. As a result, each month fell by one or two jiao compared to the morning closing price. However, the February term rose by two jiao. Sales included Dafu 2,850 bales, Changfeng 1,900 bales, Xincheng 300 bales, Jinchang 400 bales, Hexing 350 bales, Shengyuan 400 bales, and Senkang 350 bales.

<p>The sales of spot gauze are more active than before. It is found that various groups bought a total of 1,008 bales throughout the day. The market price rose by one yuan. The various buying groups are as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, advancing steadily. Silver has fallen strangely, and gold prices have rebounded. However, the overseas cotton market is still mediocre. Only Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton are trending high. Thus, people's hearts are tense, and the market is dry. The market price is rising.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Zheng Marked Cotton Advances <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>At the opening of the marked cotton market, each month jumped higher. However, American cotton fell by five to seven points, while Indian cotton saw mixed ups and downs, ranging from 0.025 to 0.75 rupees. Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton rose by 2.3 yuan. Actually, due to the sudden rise in marked gold, people's hearts are even more buoyant. However, trading was not strong. Changhe sold. As a result, each month rose by an average of four or five jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, each month rose uniformly. Because the marked gold reached a peak of over 72 yuan, the market atmosphere suddenly heated up. After the second round of bidding, Tongcheng Company's long positions emerged, and Changhe continued to close out positions. The marked gold retreated from the high, and the market sentiment turned flat. Each month retraced by one or two jiao. As a result, each month rose by five fen to one jiao and three jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included Dafu 2,400 dan, Meiji 2,300 dan, Xincheng 1,500 dan, Changhe 12,400 dan, Yuda 1,900 dan, Guangfeng 2,200 dan, Shenji 2,200 dan, and Taichang 2,000 dan.

The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factory Demand is Flat</p>
<p>The current cotton consumption is mediocre. Factory demand is not smooth. The sources include Yao cotton 1,222 bales and Tong cotton 1,060 bales.</p>
<p>The possibility of extending American cotton management - Sellers mostly retraced and fell.</p>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton opening saw sluggish market conditions. Each month rose or fell by one to four points. Near months fell due to foreign merchants selling, long positions closing out, and Southern hedging. Distant months recovered due to some rolling over. January's long positions continued to close out, and there were rollovers. Part of this rollover is attributed to the government. Also, due to the South increasing licensed reserves by about 5,000 bales, the government had some selling. The general opinion is that under the constitution, new cotton management will be difficult to implement. However, there is a possibility of extension. The closing was balanced, with spot goods falling by five points and futures falling by five to eight points. British cotton spot goods were unchanged, and futures fell by five or six points. Indian cotton initially rose due to futures traders and retail investors buying, but later retraced due to short positions selling. The Pingguoer fell by 0.5 to 1 rupee, the Aomula rose by 0.25 to 0.75 rupee, and the Bailuoxi fell by 0.25 rupee. Original telegram recorded (16th telegram).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Bailuoxi cotton on the 17th was 205 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day's closing.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Ke Xian market conditions continued to see Yangtze River shipments arriving. However, transactions have already come to a standstill. Because Nanshi merchants are mostly sampling and preparing for the New Year, there is no formal market on the market. Yesterday, only 265 bags of Anqing machine-milled Xian were opened, priced at nine yuan. Other firms directly allocated more than 400 bags to this street, which were Jiangxi Wen Tai rice. The market price was similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>Currently, Ke Xian has approximately 350,000 bags or more in stock. There are also a small number of foreign rice stockpiles. Also, warehouses in the Zhabei Old Jiang area have stockpiled more than 300,000 bags of various rice types. In addition, there are stockpiles at He Xia's Hu Yu Xing Rice Shop. It is said that the total rice in stock in the city is at least 800,000 bags or more.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Flour and Wheat Futures Suddenly Rise - Only Today's Trading <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The flour market initially showed continued declines, but reversed from decline to rise in the afternoon. When prices opened in the morning, foreign wheat quotes from both Chicago and Canada were around 1.2 jiao. Therefore, opening prices were similar to before. Then, some floating long positions, because after this one day, the market will be closed for ten days, the risk is inevitably too great, so they closed out one after another. Near-term contracts fell back by one and a half fen, and distant-term contracts fell by two and a half fen. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, marked gold had rebounded by one or twenty yuan, causing outsiders' hearts to become active again. Also, Tianjin factories covered short positions, causing all months to uniformly rebound, rising by two, three, and four fen compared to the closing price outside the afternoon. After this situation, if foreign wheat cannot be cost-effective, it is ultimately not expected to be too low before the green and yellow meet.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market for each month was generally stable. Foreign wheat quotes were slightly better. The afternoon also saw a significant increase in gold prices. Therefore, during the trading silence, it uniformly held firm. However, both sides were preparing to close accounts, so the rising trend was peaceful. Current wheat, due to the factory's stomach stopping, only parcels were unopened.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains Exchange is scheduled to be closed from January 19th to 27th, and will resume normal bidding from the 28th.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various groups arrived at more than forty houses (goods totaling more than 8,000 shi). The street's sales market was ordinary. Fortunately, bundled thick japonica sold smoothly with more than 4,000 bundles, and thin indica with more than 3,000 bundles. Therefore, the market was stable. The Su Tong japonica was set. The thin indica middle-tier also held the old market. High-quality goods added three fen. However, Nangang early rice was soft by several fen. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than fifty houses from various sources arrived at He Xia. White japonica for sales in the city's stomach shops was still flat. Stockpilers continued to be strong. The market shape was weak in the early market by several fen, and stabilized in the afternoon market. Early rice was flat and weak. Thin indica was not good at zeroing. Tianjin stomach continued to handle. The price shape was flat and stable. Yang Du Jian was slightly soft. White Yuan and Yin Yuan went to the stomach for short prices slightly taken, the price was small, near the corner. Ke Jian was short of trade. The rest of the goods were slightly soft.</p>

<p>The market price trend of soybean oil and peanut oil in the twenty-fourth year can be divided into three segments. From February 8th (i.e., the fifth day of the lunar New Year) to the end of April, it was generally stable. Because arrivals and sales were balanced, there were no unexpected disturbances. From May to September, it was entirely in a sluggish state. At this time, arrivals surged and sales were weak. Affected by the economic downturn in various parties, the first ten days of September were the most depressed. From October to December, due to the fatigue from above, buyers took advantage of the cheapness and moved again. Midway through, legal tender was implemented, and people's hearts were uniformly upward, so the market price soared. Statistics show that the difference between the highest and lowest prices of soybean oil in the past year is more than ten yuan and four jiao. Peanut oil also has more than six yuan and four jiao. A table is listed below, and the recent investigation of the bottom stocks of various oils is attached for reference.</p>

<p>Yesterday (Friday)'s woolen market saw both sides seeking to collect and settle the final accounts. Only the retail tailoring of camel wool for clothing in the door shops was still not weak. Most of the trade association had no market. The head cloth for Western-style clothing suits has arrived recently. It is entirely owned by the disassembly shops that produce samples. Recently, the ordering of woolen fabrics is led by the disassembly shops (because they want to produce samples). This leads to an earlier shipping period. Therefore, spring, summer, autumn, and winter wool fabrics are imported from abroad and arrive in Shanghai first and foremost due to the disassembly shops. It is heard that various types of head cloth thin wool fabrics and wool fabrics thick broadcloth, etc., which are needed for spring sales, are now being shipped. It is rumored that a large number of goods were shipped in December and January. Therefore, even more goods will arrive next month. However, due to the relationship between exchange rates and customs duties, the opening price of goods next spring will definitely be even higher than now.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Investigation - The Origin of the Decline of the Tianjin Weaving Industry <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) The weaving industry and the carpet industry in this city are both important local handicrafts. During the years of the Republic of China 18 and 19, there were more than 400 weaving factories, large and small, with more than 10,000 workers. After the Republic of China 20, it gradually declined. By the number of factories in the previous year, although still maintaining more than 300, the number of workers has decreased by more than seventy percent. By last year, it was getting worse. During the summer and autumn, the number of machines stopped accounted for as much as 80 percent. Also, each factory dismissed workers and apprentices to save expenses. By the autumn and winter seasons, business slightly turned. According to people in the industry, the biggest reason for the decline of native cloth is the oppression from foreign cloth. According to the general sales price of foreign cloth, compared with the cost of local cotton yarn, it is already about the same. Therefore, after weaving, the quality is below foreign goods, and the selling price is above foreign goods. Relatively speaking, it is impossible to exist.</p>

<h3 id="e181">The Similarities and Differences Between British and American Women <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>England is known for its cleanliness, order, and gentlemanly manners. Naturally, these merits cannot but be attributed to women. British women's skill in managing the home is the best in Europe. In every family in England, even if they are not very wealthy, even if they do not have servants to handle the labor, they always keep the home clean and orderly. Every day, the husband goes out to work, and the wife stays at home to sweep, dust, wash away dirt, and manage meals. When the husband returns home from work, he can always see a cheerful and lively wife, accompanying him for meals. Although such a housewife who is good at managing the home is so busy during the day, she still maintains a noble demeanor when she goes out for walks, recreation, or attends banquets with her husband in the evening. Furthermore, British women are very fond of saving. Although the husband's income is not very abundant, they will certainly be diligent and thrifty in saving some money for reserves. Before marriage, there are plenty who are self-sufficient through their occupations, but after marriage, more than 90% are in the home, managing the household for their husbands.</p>
<p>Although America and England are sister countries, the lives of American women are completely different from those of British women. American women are especially fond of enjoying themselves. The most feared thing for general American women is managing the home. Those with ample financial resources entrust sweeping and washing to servants. Those who cannot afford to hire servants simply move into apartments, so that even food does not need to be prepared by themselves. Therefore, in every family in America, although considerable cleanliness and order are maintained, it is generally not due to the housewife's efforts. American women are most particular about socializing. Women's activity in the social arena is far greater than that of men, so husbands cannot force their wives to be docile in the home. Moreover, husbands cannot force their wives to go out and play together. Women's occupations are much more developed in America than in England. Unmarried women are engaged in occupations, needless to say. Even married women, in general, still work outside. American women do not pay much attention to saving money. Because they all attach great importance to occupations and neglect the home, they also consider raising children to be a very troublesome matter. Therefore, the issue of birth control is not generally sympathized with by housewives in England, but in America, it has a very strong force. Because general American women all consider childbirth to be a great enemy of their career and social life.</p>
<p>As for the similarities between British and American women, there are also some. They are equally patriotic to their country. They are equally sympathetic to society. They are equally progressive about women's suffrage. They equally embrace a lifelong attitude of research towards learning. And the love of sports is also a common characteristic of British and American women.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Do We Really Need a Family? <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xue Zhao</p>
<p>In 1934, the Soviet newspaper "Pravda," recognizing the importance of this everyday life issue, raised the question "Seeking the Soviet Family" to solicit opinions from young people. How should we reconcile our personal private lives with society? This is a serious open question. The answer from most Soviet youths was: We want a family, we want a family that harmonizes our personal lives with society.</p>
<p>That is also my meaning. To put it concisely, I will quote the words of the scientist Langevin in his "The Individual and Society": "The more we participate in mass undertakings, the happier our personal lives will be." These words could not be more correct.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, the lives of ordinary modern Chinese people cannot really be considered happy. They do not like suitable and moldy entertainment, such as plays, etc. They prefer to read novels and poems, alone among the flowers and under the moon, in the corner of the room, reading carefully, savouring carefully. They like to smoke opium, like to get snacks to eat. If they are a bit more modern, they go to dance halls, watch movies, make some friends, such so-called "living room gentlemen and ladies," today talking about this friend's love affairs, tomorrow talking about that wife's love history, moving their tongues, arguing, today getting along with this person, tomorrow not getting along with that person. Although they try their best to make their private lives a bit more lively, but turning over and over in their small circle, they are still weak; they lament the emptiness and boredom of life, they want to pursue the glory of the past in history, and forget that they themselves are the people who create history. They do not do this thing instead. Like the format of their lives? It is too biased towards the individual, too far away from society, they are like closing their own doors, naturally not tasting reasonable happiness. Conversely speaking, reasonable happiness requires harmonizing the individual and society, continuously adding my individual to the actions of society; at the same time, having a strong interest in any legitimate thing, a great optimistic attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Sweden's Divorce Arbitration System <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Bu Ren</p>
<p>No one can deny that as the women's rights movement rises, divorce procedures are gradually becoming easier, and divorce cases are gradually increasing. The opinions of commentators on the pros and cons of easy divorce are quite inconsistent. Some believe that divorce should be absolutely free, and some advocate that the restrictions on divorce should be as strict as possible. In fact, there are certainly many who obtain satisfactory happiness after divorce, but there are also not a few who hastily divorce due to a moment of passion and regret it. In short, in a country where women's economic status cannot be completely independent, it is impossible to seek a divorce system without any drawbacks and a divorce trial that is completely fair and impartial. Recently, many people have advocated that before divorce cases are litigated in court, a separate handling agency should be established to engage in review and persuasion, in order to reduce unfortunate events that can be salvaged, because once an incompatible couple meets in court, both sides do their best to attack, and the judge relies entirely on legal clauses, and things reach the point of no return. In Sweden, which is known for its advanced women's rights movement, the authorities have taken the lead in implementing this claim. This is Sweden's divorce arbitration system.</p>
<p>In Sweden, a person who requests a divorce, whether it is unilateral or with mutual consent, must apply to the Divorce Arbitration Committee. The arbitration committee consists of two members, two women and one man, appointed by the Judicial Permanent Bureau. After receiving the divorce application, the Arbitration Committee engages in investigation, inquiry, and persuasion. If it believes that it fully meets the legal conditions for divorce and both parties insist that they do not want to reconcile, the committee will order temporary separation. The separation is for a period of one year, and a formal divorce certificate will be issued after the expiration of the term. According to statistics, out of one hundred couples requesting a divorce, twenty-five or more couples have had their divorce idea broken due to the committee's efforts in mediation, and thirty or more couples have achieved reconciliation and repaired the old relationship during the temporary separation period. This is to say that due to the establishment of the divorce arbitration system, the number of divorce cases in Sweden that have become a fact has decreased by more than half.</p>
<p>Mrs. Branting is one of the three members of the Swedish Divorce Arbitration Committee. She is the daughter of Branting, who served as the Prime Minister of Sweden for three years, and the founder of the Swedish Legal Aid Association, practicing law in the capital and gaining a great reputation. In a recent speech in New York, Mrs. Branting said to people: "Women leaving the family is gradually increasing; I do not believe that they want to do this, it is really the economic laws that force them to take this path. I believe that men and women living together is a common ideal, but this ideal must be based on mutual love and understanding rather than on an economic basis."</p>
<p>Looking at these words, we can imagine what kind of woman Mrs. Branting is who cares about family happiness. Her being selected as a divorce arbitration committee member related to the happiness of families across the country is certainly not accidental.</p>

<h3 id="e184">An Interview with Liu Wang Liming <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Ji Ping</p>
<p>Mrs. Wang Liming, wife of Liu Zhanen, president of Shanghai University, is known to everyone as an outstanding talent in the women's community. She studied in the United States, is good at speaking, and has a voice in the times. After returning to China, she has been serving the women's community for fifteen years. She has always advocated that Chinese society needs new virtuous wives and good mothers, which is generally praised. Yesterday at dusk, I had a ten-minute conversation with her at the Chinese Women's Temperance Union, and I thought it was very valuable, and now I faithfully report it to the readers.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Recent Photo of Liu Wang Liming <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>"Mrs. Liu, what was the most memorable thing about her student days?" This was my first question.</p>
<p>She thought for a while and said happily: "There are many memorable things, I can't say them all at once. Let me give you an example first. In 1918, when I was studying at Northwestern University in the United States, the school held a speech contest, and there were representatives from all levels, and there were people from all countries, but only Chinese people did not participate. I was very angry and dared not belittle myself. Many Chinese female students advised me not to make a fool of myself, because two years ago a Chinese student had failed, and everyone thought it was too dishonorable. I resolutely wanted to vent my anger and finally got third place. The following year, another contest was held, and I prepared early. As a result, I was lucky enough to get first place, so our classmates thought it was a great honor. In the same year, the Women's Christian Temperance Union held a summer conference at Late Geneva. In the evening, female representatives from various countries gave speeches. According to custom, there was no applause. I represented East Asia and also gave a long speech. As soon as I stepped down from the stage, the whole audience burst into applause and raised me high and scrambled to kiss me. Finally, I was able to raise my eyebrows for Chinese women, and the compatriots who were present felt very happy. These few things are not bragging, but to show that a woman should not give way when she should. When something happens, she must have the courage to take into account the dignity of the country everywhere. If she is timid and afraid, she will accomplish nothing."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Liu, how is her life as a housewife?"</p>
<p>"After I returned to China in 1920, I served at the Chinese Women's Temperance Union. In 1926, the union was reorganized and I was elected as the general secretary, and I have been doing so ever since. The year I got married was 1922. Originally, I worked full-time at the union. Because I was busy with housework after giving birth, I changed to handling household affairs in the morning and going to the union to work in the afternoon. I think being a mother is the greatest, most difficult, and most difficult job, which is different from doing other things. For example, child rearing, hygiene, management, nursing, etc., mothers must be able to speak and do. Not only that, but also family finances, cooking, sewing, assisting her husband's career, everything belongs to the scope of household affairs, which is much more difficult than teaching one or two subjects, or any other occupation. Therefore, I advocate new virtuous wives and good mothers, and they cannot give up their family responsibilities. Even if they have extra strength to serve society, they must reallocate their time after production. If they entrust household affairs to maids, that is a great loss. My ideal is that after the reform of the social system in the future, we will break the maid system, manage our own families, raise our own children; and even take care of our own food and clothing. This is reasonable."</p>

<p>"How does Mrs. Liu usually entertain herself?"</p>
<p>"I don't have much entertainment. I just play with my children in my leisure time. I have two sons and one daughter, which is enough to keep me busy. They play ball when they want to play ball, and play games when they want to play games: this is what I like the most. Sometimes I plant flowers with them and appreciate the beautiful flowers and plants. Every night, I supervise them to study for two hours. Sometimes, I engage in writing. These are all my ways of entertaining myself."</p>
<p>"What criticism does Mrs. Liu have of urban women?"</p>
<p>"I don't want to criticize, but they have two common problems: Most women will get married, but they are completely unprepared before marriage, such as in terms of household education. Most of them know nothing. After marriage, they are not united at all. Most women are enthusiastic about public affairs when they are in school, but after marriage, they suddenly change their attitude and never care about social welfare undertakings. In social banquets, they are gorgeously dressed, like flowers and jade, actively participating. When they have free time, they play cards and watch movies for fun. They don't read books or newspapers all day long, and they don't care about their children. Children born in such families are not happy, but simply suffering! It is not as good as the family happiness of poor mothers and children embracing each other all the time. These can be said to be the degeneration of life and the degeneration of the spirit. I often say that if a woman cannot make her family management scientific, her life rational, her furnishings artistic, and her economy thrifty after marriage, and at the same time does not have a proper understanding of society, does not fulfill her civic obligations, and does not take on the responsibility of saving the country, then she cannot be considered a wife and mother of the times."</p>
<p>"So, which way does Mrs. Liu think modern women should go?" This was my question before and after. "It would take a long time to explain this. In short, in addition to managing the family, modern women should have a sound personality, seek the evolution of society, and fulfill their national duties. The work that should be done at present, such as abolishing concubines, prohibiting prostitution, rescuing female beggars, prohibiting keeping maids, and helping unemployed women...etc., are all matters of women themselves and should be united to relieve the suffering of the public. In short, saving the country and the people is not only the responsibility of men. To revive the nation, women need to promote it. That is all I want to say at the moment!"</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e187">A Ray of Hope <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Hao Wu</p>
<p>The baby's unease and crying intensified day by day! Especially on that windy and rainy night, the crying sound changed from loud to hoarse, intermittent. When the family members changed the swaddling clothes for the baby, they suddenly discovered that the cloth strip wrapping the umbilical cord had come off its original position; the severed end of the umbilical cord protruded moistly outside the navel.</p>
<p>Consequently, the mother's milk could not be smoothly sucked into the baby's mouth due to spasms in the baby's mouth.</p>
<p>The family members were bewildered. The old and frail midwife then came to fumigate the baby's ears for a while and determined that this was an "incurable lockjaw fright." However, the sorceress who communicated with ghosts and gods (?) confidently said after a series of actions: "The disease will turn for the better - and in the near future."</p>
<p>A reassurance pill rolled into the family's esophagus: "Then we don't have to panic!"</p>
<p>The baby lived, struggling! Bluish-purple skin, thin and bony face; refused to eat, whimpering and crying, cry! Work hard, little life; because it's just there! Because only in your weak cry is there still a ray of hope.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Go to the Kitchen - Family Recipes <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Liyun</p>
<p>"Three days after marriage, she enters the kitchen and washes her hands to make soup;" wives and daughters must study cooking. In these recessionary years, you must not make jokes about eating a free meal when managing the household. "Returning to the kitchen" is not a shameful thing. Especially in this era of rich world but poor people, we should bury our heads and work hard. Do everything yourself and cook your own meals!</p>
<p>Cooking; The control of ingredients is certainly a major issue, as the saying goes: "Even a clever woman cannot cook without rice," but the sweetness and saltiness of the seasoning, the intensity of the heat, and cooking all have important relationships; A good cook can make even vegetables and tofu delicious, otherwise, even the most precious delicacies will taste like chewing wax, so the heat and seasoning of dishes are very important in cooking.</p>
<p>Now, I will list a few dishes with different cooking methods:</p>
<p>Hundred Treasure Wild Duck Wild duck is a special product of Taihu Lake. In Suzhou, live ones are sold in the market in winter. There are also several wild game shops that sell cooked wild duck, only doing business in winter and spring. However, that kind of cooked wild duck is only suitable for wine and porridge. It is better to cook rice dishes yourself. Stewed wild duck is not as tasty as braised. After gutting the wild duck, stuff it with glutinous rice mixed with minced pork or chestnuts, etc., and then braise it with seasonings. Put it in a casserole and simmer it on a charcoal stove. It is fragrant, fatty, and delicious.</p>
<p>Winter Bamboo Shoots with Shredded Meat First, pick and wash the shepherd's purse, then cut the meat and winter bamboo shoots into thin shreds, then heat oil and stir-fry them. For all stir-fried dishes in cooking, such as stir-fried shrimp, stir-fried shredded meat, etc., the oil must be hot, and the fire must be strong. After heating it very strongly, put in the shrimp, etc., and stir-fry it slightly with a spatula. The shrimp, etc., that are cooked are both cooked and tender, and very fresh. If the oil is not hot enough, the dishes will not be fresh and tender, and the taste will be very different. Of course, stir-fried shepherd's purse with shredded meat and winter bamboo shoots is also cooked in the same way. After putting the shredded meat into the pot, put in the shepherd's purse and winter bamboo shoots immediately. Cook it over high heat, slightly piercing through, then serve it up. The taste is very delicious.</p>
<p>Shrimp Balls and Fish Balls When serving hot pot, shrimp balls and fish balls are also essential dishes in the family. The cooking method of shrimp balls is to first mash two scallion whites together with the shrimp meat, then add two or three egg yolks depending on the amount of shrimp meat, mash and mix them, then add some rice wine and mix well; then boil a pot of boiling water and make the shrimp meat paste into balls one by one and throw them into the water. When the shrimp balls are thrown into the water, the fire at the bottom of the pot only needs to maintain the temperature of the water, burning as if there is no fire, then the cooked shrimp balls will be tender and fresh. If the heat is too strong, then the shrimp balls will be old and tasteless. The method of making fish balls is roughly the same as that of shrimp balls, but the procedure of scraping the fish fillets and removing the fine bones is a bit troublesome, and the eggs mixed into the fish paste must use egg whites. After the fish balls are made, they are like crystal balls.</p>

<p>— Qin Wang Yin Jiu</p>
<p>In the week after school, Qiu Yun was really busy enough, preparing everything needed to go to America, wishing she could complete everything in one breath, even to the point of not being able to sleep for several nights. Suddenly one day, her cousin came; the cousin was a young mother who was already married and had a two-year-old son. She had the best relationship with Qiu Yun on weekdays. Her husband worked as a traveling accountant in a large company and often went out. Whenever he went out, the cousin would invite her to live with her. This time he went to Fujian again, and the cousin came to invite her again. She really didn't want to go, but her mother saw that she was too tired from being busy and hoped that she could rest for a while, so she tried her best to persuade her, and Qiu Yun finally agreed.</p>
<p>Although she was very lively and generous, she had never been close to men. When her brother's friends came to her house, she would only give a few brief greetings and was too lazy to talk. When one-sided love letters were thrown in, she would always tear them up as soon as she opened them. This time, after she went to her cousin's house, she found that her cousin had recently developed a hobby, which was playing cards. The reason was very simple, because a gambling family had recently moved in next door, and the sound of cards could be heard every day. However, there were no outsiders in the gambling, only a few family members. So, the cousin pulled them along. When Qiu Yun went, the cousin naturally wanted to try her best to win her over, and also explained that there were no men in this family except for two old men. Qiu Yun couldn't refuse firmly, so she went and played a few rounds of cards. Unexpectedly, one day, a young man with very gorgeous clothes and a very gentle manner suddenly came to the card table. At first, he said he was replacing the old lady, but later he replaced her for a long time. At that time, Qiu Yun was losing very badly, and this gentleman happened to be sitting to her left, so he tried his best to help her. Every time he played a card, it was beneficial to Qiu Yun; this had already made Qiu Yun very happy, and the man's words were particularly seductive. Every time he said a word, he could always make people sympathize. By the end of the game, his shadow had been deeply embedded in Qiu Yun's mind. From then on, this man came to play cards with Qiu Yun every day, and the power of temptation increased day by day, to the point where Qiu Yun's intelligence was completely confused, and the preparations for studying abroad completely stopped. Her father's urging created an opportunity for the man to encourage Qiu Yun to elope:</p>
<p>Two or three years later, that man appeared in the local area again and officially married another woman, while the poor Qiu Yun did not know where she had drifted to, breaking away from this world with her happiness.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Mrs. Kalinin <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yu</p>
<p>Mrs. Kalinin, Ivanovna, has become a female hero of the contemporary Soviet Union. Her deeds can be compared to her husband Kalinin (Chairman of the People's Committee of the Soviet Union), because although she is the chairman's wife, she is determined to be an independent woman. She devoted her life's energy to the reclamation of the barren land in the mountains of Siberia.</p>
<p>Originally, four years ago, she left the bustling Moscow and, with a spirit of fearlessness, established a large farm and a cultural center among the nomadic Altai people.</p>
<p>She is busy with construction work all day long, digging ponds, building power plants, raising bees and other livestock, and training students. In short, although she is already in her 50s, she lives a simple life and puts all her energy into the construction of Altai. Therefore, a large farm that supplies food to the entire region, a national school that instills culture, and children who can read and write have now been established there.</p>
<p>The Altai people used to use flint to make fire, but now they also have new-style electric lights.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter how barren a place is, as long as someone can sacrifice everything to work hard to reclaim it, it can be made prosperous. Isn't Mrs. Kalinin's success a very obvious example?</p>
<p>Women like Mrs. Kalinin are worthy of praise and can be said to be female heroes standing at the forefront of the times!</p>

<h3 id="e191">Welcoming Mr. Hu Hanmin <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Ke</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin has returned from overseas and is now about to arrive in Hong Kong. It is said that soon, he will make a special trip north to take office as the chairman of the Central Standing Committee. The central government has specially appointed welcoming officials Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Ce, and other gentlemen to go south. The "Shanghai All-Circles Preparatory Committee for Welcoming Chairman Hu Zhantang to Beijing for Office" organized by various circles in Shanghai has also been established, all of which are sufficient to be the "overture" to this grand event.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Welcoming Hu Preparatory Committee once had a proposal: to send letters to various newspapers requesting them to write articles to welcome Mr. Hu on the day of his arrival in Shanghai. Now, although Mr. Hu Hanmin has not yet arrived in Shanghai, publishing this article seems to be a bit premature, but welcoming him early can also show the sincerity of our expectations and the eagerness of our welcome.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's return to China coincides with a time when people's livelihood is declining and the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. Internally, people's livelihood is haggard and disaster victims are everywhere. Externally, the depth of the national crisis has changed from the Hebei-Chahar issue to the Suiyuan-East issue and even the Shandong issue. Moreover, the patriotic student movement is encountering obstacles everywhere. At this time, hearing the news that Mr. Hu Hanmin has returned to China to preside over the central government, we are truly overjoyed and cannot express it in words.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu's support and welcome can be seen not only from the central government's special appointment of officials to welcome him south and the establishment of welcome committees in various places, but also from the earnest expectations and sincerity of those engaged in patriotic movements in various places for Mr. Hu, which must be ten or a hundred times greater than the current manifestation of facts. They earnestly expect that the day Mr. Hu takes office will be the day when the national fortune of the Republic of China will be reversed, the day when the patriotic movement will receive effective protection, the day when revolutionary diplomacy will be implemented, and the day when the various demands put forward by those engaged in this patriotic movement will be implemented.</p>
<p>The patriotic movement should be effectively protected, there should be absolute freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, and revolutionary diplomacy should be vigorously implemented. These, these are all contained in the platform of the Chinese Kuomintang, which is also what Mr. Hu Hanmin has always strongly advocated. In the past, because Mr. Hu was far away in a different place and relinquished power, his advocacy could not be fully implemented. This time, he has the honor to serve as the chairman of the Central Standing Committee and preside over the central government. These minimum demands of the people, which are also what Mr. Hu usually advocates, are hoped to be realized starting from the day he takes office!</p>
<p>Of course, our desired minimum requirements are not to ask for a piece of paper, that is, to complete things, and we dare to request to practice them after a piece of paper is announced. In other words, what we require is not a paper check, but a full realization.</p>
<p>In addition, how to relieve the national industry and commerce? How to urgently relieve the disaster-stricken people and prevent disasters? These are all eagerly hoped by the people who are in dire straits. However, although these two items are equally important, they may not be effective immediately on the day of taking office. It is better to protect the patriotic movement and lift the ban on freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association, which are easier to achieve.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu is a revolutionary leader and a mentor to young people. He will surely express his acceptance of these minimum demands of the people and these minimum demands of national self-salvation with the utmost sincerity, and there is no doubt about it. The reason why we are tirelessly speaking is to ask Mr. Hu to express his determination to earnestly implement the various articles requested by the people on the day he takes office to comfort the people's expectations.</p>
<p>Now that the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, the people have no time and cannot accept any more "checks".</p>
<p>What we want is ironclad facts!</p>
<h3 id="e192">Golden Hair Waving Oars <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Tianwu</p>
<p>I lived in Beihongsha for a period of time, and I had to go to Grandpa Duo's bean and wheat shop every day to record the account book: from my residence to the bean and wheat shop, there was a Huansha River in between, so I had to do the business of Golden Hair Waving Oars twice a day.</p>
<p>The first time I met Golden Hair Waving Oars was in early summer, because I was new to Beihongsha and unfamiliar with the route. Uncle Shun Sheng took me aboard Golden Hair Waving Oars' ferry. Uncle Shun Sheng patted Golden Hair's back and pointed at me, saying: "This is the newly arrived Mr. Jiang from Grandpa Duo's shop. From now on, he will make you two meals of water tobacco money every day!"</p>
<p>Oar-waving Golden Hair was in his fifties. After hearing Uncle Shun Sheng's words, he dragged out two deep-wrinkled smiles at the edge of his sparse white beard. His face looked very dry, and his back was a little curved. Sometimes, he would cough hoarsely once or twice. This situation really showed his old age, but what made people disbelieve was that his hands could row the oars so nimbly. The nickname "Oar-waving Golden Hair" was probably given to him for this reason.</p>
<p>"You've been eating this rowing rice for a long time, haven't you?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Hehe! A long time! A long time! This oar was passed down from my old man's hands, and I've been doing this since I was a child."</p>
<p>"Is your livelihood based on this?"</p>
<p>"Our three generations have been eating on this riverbank. The Yang family brushes cloth and the Jin family ferries. Our Jin family even erected a sticker at this ferry during the former Qing Dynasty!"</p>
<p>"That's a pretty good income!"</p>
<p>"Not bad. In my old man's hands, one copper coin was worth one yellow ticket. A round trip could earn four cash. Relying on this oar, I also passed down a five-room hall to my father. Now that we're talking about copper cents, if we make twenty or thirty round trips a day, we can earn three or four thousand cash. The family can get by."</p>
<p>As he spoke, the smiles dragged out again at the edge of his sparse white beard. These smiles contained his satisfaction with life. The ferry arrived. He put up his oars, we went ashore, and as he rowed back, I heard him sing a mountain song: "The first silkworm doesn't look at the second silkworm, the wheat isn't harvested until the dragon boat is rowed..."</p>
<p>Because I passed through this ferry every day, the smiles at the edge of Oar-waving Golden Hair's white beard and the sound of his hoarse throat left a cordial impression on my brain until I left Beihongsha, and I could still easily think of him.</p>
<p>A few days after the Dragon Boat Festival last year, because Grandpa Duo died, I had to go to Beihongsha again. When I passed through the ferry, Oar-waving Golden Hair was still there, but what made me very strange was that his demeanor was different from before. He showed a sense of decadence amidst his old age. He hadn't seen me for a long time, so at least a few smiles should have unfolded at the edge of his white beard, but there was no joy on his face at all. I couldn't help but ask casually: "Golden Hair, are there any prizes for the dragon boats in Hongsha this year?"</p>
<p>"Who has the heart to make a fuss about the dragon boats? The days to come will be a matter of seeing there is no food to eat."</p>
<p>"What's the matter?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Jiang, don't you know? Poor people's mouths can't cause trouble. I blinded myself and ended up cutting off my own livelihood. A few days ago, the father-in-law of Grandpa Yang from the east came to Hongsha and also ferried across this Huansha River. As soon as he got on the boat, he kept urging me to row faster and faster, wishing he could step onto the ferry in one step. I didn't recognize him. When he urged me, I opened my mouth and said: "Old sir, with one oar, I can only row at a speed of first-class and second-class water. If you want to go faster, the water can't be like a good road on land. You just wait for the bridge to be built and you can take big steps across it." I didn't expect that the last sentence offended him. This father-in-law of Grandpa Yang went back and talked to Grandpa Yang, and they agreed to build a stone bridge there in Xihongtou. Don't you think that in this way, my livelihood will be cut off?"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he pointed to Xihongtou for me to see. I looked in the direction of his finger and indeed saw a few long and wide bridge deck stones piled up on the fields of Xihongtou. I said: "Why didn't you go to Grandpa Yang later to plead for mercy?"</p>
<p>"Alas! Mr. Jiang, how could I not think of it? As soon as I got the news, the whole family went to beg Grandpa Yang, but Grandpa Yang said: "It's useless for you to ask me. My father-in-law has never been someone who can be pushed around. What's more, it's you? Now that he's already made up his mind about this matter, and the township office also agrees with him!"... Mr. Jiang, I'm already at this old age, but I didn't expect to suffer this misfortune. This old bone can only row a slow and intermittent oar. What else can I do to make a living? Isn't the whole family's livelihood ruined?"</p>
<p>His voice echoed in my ears, making me unable to muster the courage to answer him. I didn't even dare to look at his face before stepping onto the dike and leaving.</p>
<p>After taking care of Grandpa Duo's funeral, the new stone bridge in Xihongtou had been completed. I stood at that ferry and looked around, but I couldn't see the shadow of Oar-waving Golden Hair and his old ferry. I could only walk onto the new stone bridge. As I walked in the middle of the bridge, looking at the middle of the Huansha River, it seemed as if Oar-waving Golden Hair was on the ferry, looking at me with tears of despair and resentment in his eyes, unblinking.</p>

<h3 id="e193">A Peculiar Person <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Lai</p>
<p>At daybreak, the faint sounds and vibrations from the engine room of the steamer roused me in Humen. By this time, the ticket collectors, a tall man with a long face and a stout man with a protruding chest, had appeared solemnly in our fourth-class cabin. I silently watched their two alert and sharp eyes scan the faces of the thirty or forty passengers. When a typical northerner with a sallow face looked at them timidly, they shouted:</p>
<p>"Tickets!" But when the passenger was too afraid to speak, they slapped him a few times, saying, "You rogue, don't you have money to take the ship? Get off at Shantou!"</p>
<p>After being slapped a few times, the passenger, with reddened eyes, fled away with his only possession, a blue serge shirt. The ticket collectors then yelled and cursed at other similar people.</p>
<p>But what was strange was a passenger next to me. From his conversation with his companions, one could tell he was from Meixian. He had been wandering since childhood, spent many years in Guangxi, worked as a soldier and as a minor clerk. He looked to be about twenty-four or twenty-five years old. His triangular eyes, filled with anger and ferocity, were paired with high, sharp cheekbones, a thin and very swarthy face, and unclean teeth peeking out from his thin lips. He was constantly grinding his teeth, as if to show he had endured endless misery and was surrounded by nothing but hateful things. However, he pretended to be a knowledgeable person with a lot of experience. In his worn wicker basket was a set of Western clothes, and he was wearing a very new rayon shirt. No one would have believed he couldn't afford an eight-dollar ticket. But this time, he really puffed out his chest and said he had no money. The two ticket collectors glared at him, their eyes wide:</p>
<p>"What? You have no money? Who believes that? Take it out now, or you'll be thrown off!"</p>
<p>"I'm going to Shanghai. If I didn't buy a ticket, I wouldn't be here. This ship belongs to the government, why can't we ride it?" He also roared angrily, staring at them with his triangular eyes: "No money!"</p>
<p>"You say you have no money? We'll search you. The shipping company belongs to the country, but the business is run by compradores. You have no conscience! Hmph! You bastard! Rogue!"</p>
<p>He was so choked by their cursing that his face turned red, and he secretly pulled out two dollars from his pocket, but then looked at them fearfully and said:</p>
<p>"I only have this much money. Do you want it?"</p>
<p>The ticket collector glared at him resentfully and quickly snatched his money:</p>
<p>"Not even enough to buy a ticket. We'll let you off this time, but you have to get off at Shantou. Shameless fellow!"</p>
<p>"No! I gave you money to buy a ticket. I want to go to Shanghai, not Shantou!"</p>
<p>He cried anxiously, but the ticket collectors had already left. All the passengers were looking at him strangely. At this time, his face turned even redder, and he seemed to smile sadly, saying:</p>
<p>"This ship belongs to the country. It's for the people. Why should I spend money? I have money, I'm not that stupid. When I get to Shanghai, I'll take the train to Nanjing, but I won't buy a ticket!"</p>
<p>He said victoriously, then looked at a Guangxi man next to him and grinned.</p>
<p>The ship sailed for a day and a night, arriving in Shantou. Those who hadn't bought tickets quietly left the ship. But the man who hadn't bought enough of a ticket put on his ill-fitting autumn suit, as if he hadn't suffered any humiliation. He cheerfully ran back and forth on the deck and even went ashore to play. At noon, the sunlight gently touched the pale green water of the sea, touched the open-air fourth-class cabin, and was quiet. Not many passengers remained here. I began to silently watch the singing girls wandering on the ship and their faces with bitter smiles.</p>
<p>The passenger returned, bringing fresh fruit produced in Shantou, and he and several Guangxi people were eating and talking.</p>
<p>A fourteen-year-old singing girl smiled and agreed to their request, singing those unpleasant "Eighteen Touches" songs. He nestled close to her, listening with his triangular eyes glazed over. One song after another was sung. When she pleaded with them for money, he slowly shook his head, as if dissatisfied with the singing, and smiled bitterly, taking out two jiao coins.</p>
<p>"Not enough, sir! And these jiao coins are hard to use!" She looked at him coquettishly, twisting and turning. "Please help me. My family of eight relies on this to survive!"</p>
<p>"What? Who wants to listen to your bad songs? Get lost! Get lost! Damn you!"</p>
<p>The passenger roared angrily, his face fierce, grinding his teeth, as if driving something away. The singing girl was startled by his shout and walked away in tears. Then, he looked at his companions victoriously and laughed heartily, as if thinking his soul was so noble.</p>
<p>"This world! I've suffered a lot, but I also want to show my authority! It has to be this way!"</p>
<p>His joyful appearance and his words stunned me. I looked at this peculiar person in pain and remained silent.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Welcoming the God of Joy <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>Small firecrackers crackled like popping beans under the eaves of every house, and the night slowly revealed its ashen grayness.</p>
<p>The shady parts of the house were still dark. The wick in the oil lamp emitted a small flame, flickering with a faint, dim light. Dad rubbed his red, sleepless eyes with his sleeve, coughed twice against the wall, took a breath, tapped the ashes from his pipe onto the windowsill, and said to Mom:</p>
<p>"Go make dumplings. People are already setting off firecrackers at dawn."</p>
<p>Mom quietly stepped out the door and brought some sorghum stalks from the yard. She added water to the pot in the outer room, and the sorghum stalks crackled in the stove like damp firecrackers. Dad remained blankly in a daze. He hadn't been back for long. He had left on the day of the kitchen god festival. High-legged Li from the Shuangshengxing Pharmacy had looked for him several times, and the Hongchang family came every day. Mom cried to them and swore that Dad had joined the army. But they didn't believe it. High-legged Li said as he left:</p>
<p>"He's hiding. He can hide until he's thirty this year, but not past the first day of next year."</p>
<p>Everyone else was offering sacrifices and eating dumplings. Dad ran back covered in a thick layer of snow. Mom twisted him around, brushed the snow off his clothes, and he climbed onto the kang and started smoking. After a while, he sniffled and sighed with a worried frown.</p>
<p>At this moment, Mom put the dumplings into the pot one by one and stirred them with a spoon. The wick burning in the lamp crackled, the flame flickered, and the lamp went out with a "squeak." The room was suddenly filled with darkness. The large, chessboard-like window cast a square of pale light.</p>
<p>"Go welcome the God of Joy. Little Baozi, go with your dad."</p>
<p>Dad grunted when he heard Mom's words. He put his pipe on the windowsill, climbed down from the kang, and said while putting on his "monkey-cap":</p>
<p>"Welcoming the God of Joy, he won't come to our house anyway. He only goes to the homes of the fortunate."</p>
<p>"Don't talk about unlucky things on the fifth watch of the New Year."</p>
<p>Mom grumbled as she came into the room, put the big red cotton hat on me, tied the leg straps, and took me off the ground, instructing:</p>
<p>"Kowtow sincerely, hoping we'll have a better year!"</p>
<p>Dad took the God of Joy print from the Kitchen God table, took out three long incense sticks, and led me out of the house. The snow had stopped, and the wind howled sharply, making my face feel sore and painful. I didn't want Dad to hold my hand and rubbed my face with my hands. After a while, my hands felt swollen and numb. Dad looked at me, smiled, and carried me in his left arm. Going down the riverbank was scary. The planks were covered with ice. Dad's feet slipped accidentally, and we slowly walked down the slope step by step. There was a large expanse of white snow on the river beach. The river was covered with thick ice. The snow, like a furry, shimmering blanket, lay quietly across to the endless fields on the opposite bank. The green wheat seedlings were buried under the glittering snow layer. The entire gray sky was covered with a shimmering white light, and the cold wind swirled with fine ice particles.</p>
<p>The small food stall by the bridge was closed, cold and empty. Two dogs were chasing each other in front of the door. A tall merchant walked over from the bridge, with a ledger on his shoulder and a "dalian" for holding money.</p>
<p>"Tch, that debt collector, coming back at dawn."</p>
<p>Dad said, putting me down and pointing it out to me. After he finished speaking, he lit the incense and stuck it into the thick snow. He burned the God of Joy print. Dad knelt down, kowtowing towards the north, and said:</p>
<p>"God of Joy, bless me with a smooth year, and I'll give you a new robe and gild you."</p>
<p>After he finished kowtowing, he brushed the snow off his legs. I also ran down. The merchant staggered over. I had just kowtowed once.</p>
<p>"Your family said you joined the army. Well, don't you think, if Shuangshengxing hadn't lent you medicine, you say, at this time..."</p>
<p>"Hey, Shopkeeper Li, I won't forget your kindness. I'll definitely pay you back when I find a long-term job this year."</p>
<p>"It's the first day of the New Year tomorrow. In principle, I shouldn't be asking for debts anymore, but I still have debt collectors from Jizhou Pharmacy lying in my house. Give me a bit of it by the tenth of the month..."</p>
<p>Dad hesitated and agreed, picked me up, and ran home in a panic. As soon as he entered the door, he sighed loudly and said:</p>
<p>"God of Joy! As soon as I go out, it's a god of misfortune!"</p>
<p>Note: "Hiding" means avoiding creditors before the New Year. "God of Joy print" means a woodblock-printed image of the God of Joy.</p>

<p>Old Man Liu</p>
<p>Old Man Liu is a renowned hero in the martial arts world, known for his chivalry. His good friend, Zheng Ermazi, a platoon leader in the army, killed his superior—the battalion commander—out of righteous indignation for his heinous deeds. Although the battalion commander was wicked, military law could not be evaded. Zheng Ermazi was wounded and fled to Old Man Liu's doorstep. However, Old Man Liu was away on a mission with bandits, and only his son, Guangzu, was home. Zheng Ermazi begged Guangzu to let him hide, but Guangzu was a cunning young man who hated Zheng Ermazi for often speaking ill of him to his father. Therefore, he refused to take him in. Meanwhile, Platoon Leader Wang, leading soldiers, was quickly approaching in pursuit of Zheng Ermazi.</p>
<p>In this desperate situation, Zheng Ermazi finally secured refuge at the cost of two dollars. Platoon Leader Wang arrived at this time, and unable to find Zheng Ermazi, he tempted Guangzu with a gold watch. A gold watch ultimately outweighed two dollars, and Zheng Ermazi was betrayed.</p>
<p>Old Man Liu returned and saw that his friend had been harmed by his son. Furthermore, Zheng Ermazi cursed him as a "treacherous friend," tarnishing Old Man Liu's lifelong reputation. In the end, what happened to Zheng Ermazi? He was captured. What happened to the gold watch? It was smashed. And what happened to his son? He was shot!</p>

<p>Ten thousand zhang of the Milky Way hang in the blue sky. The light flows swiftly, and the autumn wind returns. The Weaver Girl and Cowherd meet once a year. How much longing in a single evening. I know, the Emperor's son is called Weaver Girl. Lonely in her boudoir in the east of the river. Year after year, she weaves diligently. The seamless heavenly robe is a peerless masterpiece. Therefore, the Emperor took pity on her living alone. He permitted her to marry a young cowherd west of the river. Who knew that once their hearts were joined, they became lazy. The Emperor ordered her to return and live east of the river. From then on, they could not visit often. They could only meet once a year. The matter is vague, but the sentiment is believable. Know that without diligence and thrift, there is no success. The same principle applies to heaven and earth. Diligence and thrift are endlessly useful. I know, the Cowherd was a poor man. How could he become a son-in-law in the heavenly palace. Wealth and poverty should be different and hard to match. Marriages in the world are also the same. Therefore, do not envy the wife's wealth and pursue it. Do not be greedy for gifts and turn your eyes red. Marital union does not depend on gold and jewels. Like-mindedness and mutual affection are essential. A scholarly couple studies together. Husband and wife follow each other in harmony and joy. It is also said that on the day the Cowherd married the Heavenly Granddaughter. He owed a bride price of ten thousand pairs of gold. Therefore, he was punished to herd cattle hard for a lifetime. Punished to meet only once a year. If the bride price is not paid off. It will be difficult to dream together in the same bed. Anecdotes and strange events are commonly told. All are in a vague place. However, I have other feelings to embellish. I remotely present a green message to the heavenly palace. I beg the Emperor to grant a great wish. Do not let the Heavenly Granddaughter live east of the river. The bride price of ten thousand dollars should be completely waived to relieve poverty. Moreover, this year's weather is even more peculiar. Droughts and floods are heavy. I hope to use the bride price as relief funds. To spread rain and dew and bathe in benevolent winds. If the Emperor approves my request. I will certainly be terrified and grateful to the heavens. Water, drought, and war are everywhere. How can the heavens comply with everything. I am just writing my heart to ease my mind.</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng's Three Smiles Guo Ben (800), 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Thousand Year Blessing"</p>
<p>Living in the Ten Scenic Spots of West Lake. Half village, half city, a watery land. Plant weeping willows in front of the door. Bamboo leaves and banana trees peek through the pink walls. Parents are both healthy and vigorous in the hall. Osmanthus trees in the courtyard are fragrant. Red sleeves and red smiles are the maids. Peach Root and Peach Leaf are the concubines. Why must family wealth be as rich as Tao Zhu's. A thousand acres of fertile fields are a small fortune. Those who come and go are learned guests. Li Bai, Su Dongpo, Zhao Ziyang. Wang Youjun, Fenbu, Mi Xiangyang. They talk about the five relationships and family matters. Nothing more than songs and essays. Strolling leisurely in Jin Valley Garden. Reading the Romance of the West Chamber on a sandalwood couch. Fine wine and delicious food bring ease. Three feet of snow does not lack grain. Sometimes, a game of chess. Sometimes, a furnace of incense. Sometimes, listening to a book. Sometimes, playing mahjong. Sometimes, a clear song revolves around the painted beams. Life is blessed to this point. Three hundred thousand years and sixty thousand zhang. Why must politicians bother.</p>

<p>China and the West (1040), 12:15 AM to 1:00 AM</p>
<p>Opening "Busy Socializing"</p>
<p>Wind, flowers, snow, and moon are lively. Joyful celebrations and funerals cost a lot of money. Zhao, Qian, Sun, Li, Zhou, Wu, Zheng. It is hard to distinguish between the three strokes of Wang and the grass head Huang. Funeral notices and invitations are not to be mentioned. Sixteenth and seventieth birthdays are definitely celebrated. A one-cent stamp travels all over the world. Unobstructed in all directions. Friendships are everywhere. Spring breeze and summer rain are appropriate. However, people in the interior are already afraid of the pain of socializing. The taste of Shanghai is even harder to bear. Small children's full month or birthday. Sending out an invitation is no problem. The mistress of the house. Twenty or thirty years old. A grand banquet is held to celebrate the beautiful hall. The person in question is even more lively. Minor celebrations are held on ordinary days. Furthermore, every family honors ancestors. They are not willing to forget the birthdays of their ancestors. Filial sons and virtuous grandsons are praised by everyone. Red signatures and couplets are written on incense. If, in the darkness, they could know. They would smile happily in the Yellow Springs. Anniversaries are calculated separately. In addition, some people have ancestral halls. Turning around year after year. Red and white invitations are like urging for grain. Or it may be that the Zhang family misses, the Li family sends. Tomorrow there will be no discussion. It can be seen in society. The ways of the world have always been cold and warm. It does not matter whether they are rich merchants. Families with economies are secretly hurt. Especially, the poor who have a difficult life. They have to put on a facade and force themselves to appear. People do not consider everyone's strength. The gift-giver secretly shouts injustice. They issue invitations and invite guests on behalf of others. The only fear is that teachers will have to be let go one after another in the future. I say that we should transform social customs and respect practicality. Socializing does not have to be extravagant. Every family has weddings and funerals. Unnecessary socializing needs to be improved. Do not follow the superficial customs and learn vanity.</p>

<h3 id="e199">"Moonlight and Flowers" Two Leads Co-Star in New Film, "Smoke Waves of Joy" Opens at the Great Light <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Dick Powell and Rose Gyllen co-star in the new film "Shipmates Forever," which opened at the Great Light yesterday. The two stars' previous film, "Moonlight and Flowers," is still popular today. Their renewed collaboration is even more amazing. Dick Powell sings several famous songs in the film, which are now popular throughout the United States. Rose Gyllen performs the most valuable dance in the film, which is even more valuable. The dance shadows of the sea waves are interesting and reflect each other. The arrogant laughter is dyed into one piece. Every place can be fascinating. It is a rare work in song and dance films. The director is Bao Caiqi, who has been famous in the directing world since the release of "Seventh Heaven," and Warner's previous production of "Moonlight and Flowers" was also directed by him.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Upcoming Performance of "Wild Geese Descending on the Han River" <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>The performance of "Raindrops on Pear Blossoms" received extraordinary support from the audience and high praise from the public opinion world. This can be said to be a great comfort to the initial collaborative achievements of the playwright Ma Xuweibang and the leading actor Chen Yanyan. So they decided to continue to collaborate on this "Wild Geese Descending on the Han River," with the joint efforts of Diao Banhua, Luo Peng, and many others.</p>
<p>During the year-long production period, the workers have been racking their brains and concentrating their efforts. We can see that its achievements have clearly surpassed the previous work of "Raindrops on Pear Blossoms" and have a further success.</p>
<p>When Ma Xu was writing the script for "Wild Geese Descending on the Han River," he had already decided on the cast, so the script is not only suitable for Chen Yanyan's personality, but it can also be said to be more suitable for the personality of each performer.</p>
<p>In order to achieve satisfactory scenery, "Wild Geese Descending on the Han River" not only spent a lot of effort on the photography field of the interior scenes, but also took the exterior scenes from afar in Putuo, a scenic beauty, where they collected many beautiful pictures and backgrounds by extracting the essence.</p>
<p>Here, focusing on the subject matter itself, in addition to clarifying its social significance, it also created a very strong tragic atmosphere, and the beautiful and sad scene in the first half is enough to make the audience's hearts turn.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan filmed the scene of falling into the water in the cold winter weather, Diao Banhua had more amazing achievements than in "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp", and Luo Peng took on the very heavy role of the male lead. Ma Xuweibang made use of his superb makeup skills to play a strange old man.</p>
<p>This film will be released soon.</p>
<h3 id="e201">"Private Tide" Opens in Paris <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The film "Raging Tide," which opened today at the Paris Grand Theatre on Xiafei Road and Hualong Road, is a masterpiece by the world-renowned "Fugitive" protagonist Paul Muni, breaking all previous amazing achievements. Therefore, Hualong Road will be congested at that time. Those who want to see a good film should come early to avoid missing it.</p>
