<p>— 柳</p>
<p>速日報載日商在長江一帶採辦小麥二萬餘噸裝運出口天津方面亦有大批收買我國粉業為之大起恐慌有請實部禁止小麥出口者傳聞部中正在研討禁麥出口不久或可實現本報津電亦有津市府深恐影響民食飭社會局調查防止之訊竊以為小麥之應吾禁止出口當視本國供求以為衡以言本國小麥之生產據一般人之的計僅供粉廠多則七八月少則五六月之用非年有鉅量洋麥進口不可其有待於洋麥之接濟也明甚旣云不足自不能再容人搬運則禁止出口也固宜但各粉廠不能全用本麥以製粉本麥卽使足以供給恐仍非攙用洋麥不可是則事實上本麥如有人要買賣之固能合宜亦未始不可以賣惟在他方面求吾所欲者補充之可矣就此以觀禁止出口似又可不必惟是各人之立塲不同見解互異一物之貴賤在消費者已以為貴生產者尙以為賤卽同是生產者在製造方面但冀原料價賤可多獲利在出產原料方面又惟恐物價低落所得難償共勞力工本之所費因之惟望原料之價昂然自工業大興農業往往有所不敵原料價格之高低有時竟操於工業者之手譬如粉麥在開始為新麥粉期貨買賣時距出新之期尙遠而其價往往已見壓低若非對於出新時之麥價預有把握何敢出此冒險之舉卽不然亦必明知農民手中之物急於出售不能久持儘可暫作觀望以待共出甚有買存若干洋麥於將近出新時期到埠使粉麥行市不易振作凡此皆無非欲使出新時之原料難得善價便其私圖然而農民苦矣</p>
<p>以故農產品登塲時之物價貴於農民為有利在此力求復興農村之際農產能售得比以前為高之價稍紆其困不但農民所希求亦大衆之所望也今日商在我國採辦大宗小麥能照市價以為買賣使麥價不至於出新時為一方所把持而農民得售較高之價此在商品市塲世界化之時代原不足奇况豆價已貴麥價之不能獨賤亦自然之趨勢也</p>
<p>民食問題之重要固盡人皆知者然因此亦易為少數人所利用每常糧市有所變動輒有人以民食作為宣傳之工具聞者不察顚末不明眞相不計利害亦盲從附和之以為此與民食有關固當如何如何此則不可不辯吾人當知自去年以來米之流入偽滿轉運而去者不知多少若以食糧不可外洩則應防止外洩者豈小麥已哉</p>
<p>抑今之出口小麥如中國商人不為代買日商斷無分往內地向農民直接收買之理在昔孫總理曾目覩北方大旱餓死人多而他方面仍有大量麥豆運往外國嘗推論其故以為「在私人資本制度之下種種生產的方法目標是賺錢因為糧食生產以賺錢為目的所以糧食在本國沒有高價的時候便運到外國去賣因為私人要賺多錢便是本國有飢荒人民沒有糧食要餓死很多人那些資本家亦是不去理會」今日之為日商探辦者固所謂「不去理會」之「資本家」也設粉商與此輩糧商易地相處當亦不復有禁麥出口之主張矣</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>一次幾個朋友吃飯，有位朋友發問道，為什麼到館子裏一般堂倌侍者總喜歡拿外國啤酒外國汽水饗客，此中什麼原因，當時的答案不一：（一）說貪圖小利。（二）說沒有知識，不明愛國道理。（三）說奉店主之命，甘心利權外溢。這般堂倌侍者，沒有國家觀念，固然無可饒恕。可是社會缺乏制裁力量，沒有是非的觀念，也是一大原因。記得褚輔成先生一天在某會會議席上大聲疾呼主張，飲食業中，要有一種肅淸運動。肅淸什麼，便是不賣外國啤酒，不飲外國汽水，從小使，到堂倌，以迄店員，經理，股東，顧客，人人存此心，人人抱此意，而後國貨事業，纔有發展的希望。</p>
<p>因此胡君西園主張與其消極的制裁，不如積極的鼓勵。從今日起，由正當的國貨團體，調查某飯店的啤酒和汽水以及一切消耗品等都用國貨，那麼，根據調查員切實的報吿，在這飯店內可說絕對不用一毫外貨飲料，應由國貨團體，或機關特給一個顯明表彰的牌子『實行國貨飲料』，或揭示「完全國貨」字樣，使顧客一望而知這樣做去其效力可說很大，不然，逢人勸吿，或訓誡堂倌，總不免枝枝節節，無甚實效。</p>
<h3 id="c137">檢私與提倡國貨 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>檢私與提倡國貨，本來是當前挽救國民經濟，復興工商唯一的途徑，所以，這兩方面的進行，是在是不能分離開來而講的，我們知道，檢私是維護國產必需的工作，而擴大和堅强國貨運動，那更是可以做到根本消滅走私的基本條件。</p>
<p>在最近關於檢私與提倡國貨的前途，我們却聽到一個很好的消息，那就是在前幾天各省市商會聯合會，於上海開會的時候，就通過了組織「中華民國各地商會檢私總會」的議案，這一個民問自動大規模檢私組織的成立，恰巧在這走私問題，依然嚴重，尤其是一般國貨工業，飽受影饗，處境益趨艱困的時候，它的意義是十分地偉大的，它的使命，更是非常重要的，我們極誠地希望他，能够在取締私運，嚴防奸商這一點上，能有很大的收獲，而對於發展國產，提倡實業的前途，更要有相當的努力，發揮他復興工商，繁榮國民經濟的本職。</p>
<p>我們曉得，本來這走私問題的澈底解决，要全國民衆自動地奮起，那實是非常地首要，因為，這是只有使一般民衆，大家明瞭，私貨的絕不可買，絕不可販，視同洪水猛獸後，那末，私貨縱能像水銀瀉地，侵入中國內地各處，但是，被各地商會等民衆團體的嚴防和相互監督後，他就永遠沒有再能改頭換面，公開發售的機會，無法推銷和脫售，這正是一個根本消滅走私問題的最好辦法。最後，我還要肯切地希望，今後我們一方面果要努力於私貨的檢舉，但另一方面，更要努力着手國貨的推銷，務使國貨工業與檢私的發展，打成一片，為未來國民經濟建設的前途，開關一條光明的路徑，也只有這樣的苦幹，能更滿足全國人民殷股的期望。</p>
<h3 id="c138">國民經濟建設運動與提倡國貨 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 潘仰堯</p>
<p>提倡國貨，在今日為中國的生死問題，與過去一二十年前，緩急大有不同，試問海關人超，年有數萬萬元，漏稅走私亦有一二萬萬元以上，每年巨量白銀的流出，更無所取償，民富幾何，不破產何待，長此沒有辦法，短者二五年，多者十年，國民經濟，將整個不可收拾，還那裏有國貨的地位，所以今日提倡國貨，服用國貨，，是挽救國民經濟的工作，是求生救死的工作，可說是今日國家最重要的工作，否認為提倡國貨，與其求人，不如求己，與其乞救，不如自救，尤其需要人人有公心，能自覺，而泯除小我的見解，撲滅利己的心思，一致在國民經濟上各獻其能力，各盡其貢獻，作嚴密之保障，以避免外貨之襲擊，就個人見解，今日國人在國民經濟的立塲，對於國貨的努力，應有四種辦法。</p>
<p>（一）團結同業力量國貨工業之求生工作，莫要於同業聞之團結，所以團結同業力量，為國貨界自救之要着，自來國貨之失敗最大的致命傷，不在外敵，而在內敵，不在外商，而在同業，明明一種極有希望之工業，經過許多的艱難創造或辛苦發明，不多時而人人繼起仿效，不問供求是否相應，需要是否增加，惑於大利所在，羣起競爭，粗製濫造，彼此跌價，結果便同感困難，同歸於盡，卒使某種工業，全軍覆沒，適予外貨以暢銷之機會，事後思量，實堪痛心，故今日同業間之合作，卽為各個自救之方法，個倘應加入同業公會，尊重同業公會的規章與議决案，再進一步，更應謀原料的合作購取，出品的合作銷售，以及一切出品方面，同業間應處處各就所長，為分工之發展，以收切實合作的效果，則國貨之生命或可維持不敝。</p>
<p>（二）注意改良出品我國國貨，較前固已日見進步，可是未滿人意的還是不少，機器設備，是否優良，工塲管理，是否合度，人事方面，是否周密，所有出品，是否已達標準化之目的，銷往外洋的貨物，是吾受人歡迎，從事國貨事業的，時時應有日新月異的精神，不斷的研究，不斷的改良，使出品的質量，都能超過人家，國貨的前途，自感光明。</p>
<p>（三）設法减低成本否認為今日國貨界的自救，同業間只有互助互救，而沒有相殺競爭，各個間所有競爭的力量，不在價値上推銷上，而在品質上成本上，果能在成本方面力求减低，出品方面力求精美，便可操勝算，佔優勢，而不愁虧折，不愁失敗，故今日國貨界應實行科學管理，試辦成本會計，革除無謂的浪費，排除不急要的設備與人員，則對於外貨之傾銷，或可與之抗衡。</p>
<p>（四）研究買主心理我國國貨之大病，在閉門造車，在師心自用，不迎合一般用戶之心理，以致所有出品，或銷於甲地，而不能銷於乙地，廠中逐楷出賣，容易積滯，而資金呆擱，周轉欠靈，亦為今日國貨界之缺點，誠使辨廠者研究買主心理，針對各地用戶之好尙，力求出品之時代化　單化，以求製造品之推行盡利，則已往之困難，或可减少。</p>
<p>以上是指製造者本身而言，同時販賣者亦應抱定非國貨不販賣的主見，努力推銷，盡力服務，使掙扎奮鬥而來之國貨，有發展推廣之機會，這是帮助國民經濟最有效的辦法，更就政府而論，為政不在多言，扼要辦法，（一）健全同業組織，而用漸進式的統制，（二）减輕捐稅，廢除各省不合理的特捐特稅，（三）改善運輸組織，同時减低其費用，（四）曾同金融界組織工業貸欵銀團，作國貨工業之後盾，並為金融界作保障，（五）領導各省市縣溝通機製品與土產品之運銷，使機製品內運，而土產品外銷，不但達物物交換之目的，且可誘致內地農村之體買力，而擴展土貨與國貨之領域，（六）輔助各地農村副業，使農民之生活富裕，人人有購用國貨之能力，更為推行國貨的基本工作。</p>
<p>同時對於一般國民，鄙人亦有致其勸吿者，國貨有今日之成績，不知紋去多少腦汁，費去多少力量，滴去多少血淚，以得如許之代價，國貨與外貨相等，應用國貨，國貨與外貨同値，應用國貨，卽使國貨品質較遜外貨，亦應用國貨，國貨價値較貴外貨，亦應用國貨，對於國貨處處應予原諒，應用指導，應加扶植，應下决心，中國人用中國貨，是大經地義，無所用其懷疑，無所用其考慮，彼日本人居留中國者，卽一烟捲，一燐寸，一紙張，一飲料，一針一線，無不用其本國貨，苟用及外國貨者，認為大不敬，認為畢生恥辱，歐美各國人何一不然，世界上决無以服用外貨為榮之民族，我愛好時髦樂用外貨之國民，奈何勿思，奈何還不自覺，只此一點，是國民經濟的活路，在工廠，在商人，在政府，在國民，均優能為之，此而不為，與坐待亡國相等，無可為之曲恕，更無可逃其責任</p>

<p>國貨在夏令，格外生氣蓬勃了！際茲火繖高張，溽暑蒸人！苟於公罷歸去，跣足，揮蒲扇，家山小居，晤對國貨，其樂陶陶！冠生園的各色菓子露，瓊漿玉液！紅，綠分明！中法藥房的明星香水，芬芳撲鼻！中國化學工業社的三星蚊香，三星牙膏，家庭工業社的爽身粉，三友社的珠羅帳，淸氣帳，毛巾被，五洲藥房的藥水皂，殺虫藥水，以及亞浦耳藍電泡，電扇，並他公司的五卅辣醬油，梅林果子醬，三樂蜜桃，蜜餞，……一切的一切，國貨在夏令，是格外顯得生氣蓬勃了！而况雪藕調冰，沉李浮瓜！展誦國貨刋物，另有一番樂趣！更何必走進威士忌氣的跳舞廳，上火山！與走入冷氣冲天！洋化十足的國泰，大光明等電影院，送錢給外國人用呢？</p>

<p>美星牙膏，是以向國外發展為主旨的，所以市上不很多見，它有著悠久可頌的事跡，值得一提，在三四年前的南洋羣島，是美星牙膏最盛銷的時候，因為品質炷粹和售價低廉，深得該地　仕的歡迎。但因此也就大受外商的嫉妒，憑著他們特殊勢力，想出種種方法破壞，侵奪，可是美星牙膏還是不屈不撓的在難困的環境下奮門著，同時在廣東廣西等地，也占有很大的地位。讀者不信，不妨一試。</p>

<h3 id="c172">由手淫所引起的「遺精」根治法 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>手淫的影響，一般所公認者為：高度神經衰弱症，體質虛弱，胃腸障碍，生殖器發育不良等；這些都是以惡癖的直接原因，或因其間接的關係而罹患的。</p>
<p>此外，達到相當年齡而仍有包皮之人，因了包皮中堆積之分泌物刺戟，極容易促誘手淫行為。共他因生活程度的提高，結婚問題更加困難，而且嫖妓需要金錢，這在感到經濟壓迫的靑年是難以辦到的，一時性慾的衝動，祇好藉手淫來排解了。這就是手淫惡癖，日益盛行的原因！</p>
<p>手淫後，第一個病象，那就是遺精了，遺精是損傷人體最劇烈而且最快的東西，它能很快地將一個强壯靑年一變而為神精衰弱症的病者。所以多數的學者，一致認為神經衰弱與遺精症有密切的關係。</p>
<p>總之，因手淫而遺精後，神經系統上就會發生障碍來了，原因因為精關弛鬆，失了射精控制的能力。所以根治的方法，必定要從固精着手，以「希米脫氏固精片」治之，同時再以滋補生殖腺最力的「生殖素」服之。因為遺精過久，使精力與精液消耗過多，身體不免虧弱，故非以「生殖素」挽回其衰弱不可，然後方可根治，</p>

<h3 id="c173">治療白濁白帶之可靠途徑 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>不姙原因，不勝枚舉，其最直接者，當然在於性病隱病，而尤以白濁，白帶，早洩，腎萎，遺精為最習見，早洩，腎萎已有「生殖素」可救治，遺精有「希米脫氏固精片」主治，茲置不論，今就白濁白帶而言，則其治法大有硏究之價値，</p>
<p>伐克辛療法，其說最新，其學最深，其效最宏，非普通一般人所得而知之，例如內服伐克辛巳有防治傷寒，痢疾，霍亂，白濁等，早為各國醫學界及著名醫師所賞用，至于淋菌苗之製法，非盡必須自菌製苗，有如人類須種牛苗，幸勿輕信識淺者之無知謬說，欺世誤人也，但白濁亦非祇伐克辛一種卽可奏功，須以透膜殺菌功效靈速之提純內服黃色素為主，「安敵淋」卽以此二種相輔並進，故對于滅淋凈濁之效，一時無出其右，至於婦女白帶及子宮炎症，除外用「療帶靈」外，同時並內服「安敵淋」，則治療更速，世之罹有白濁白帶等症，而致久婚不姙者，其注意之！</p>
<p>白濁醫例一則</p>
<p>頃有一患者名徐順達，浙之嘉善人，彼患白濁病，巳有三年之久，當初因治療不愼，致由急性而慢性，中間雖服藥多種，然仍無效，有時服時雖感覺表面痊愈，但未到幾月，重復感染。如是經過一年之久，病竟漸漸惡化，非但形體削瘦，且精神痿頓，蓋彼已淋濁過久，身體的元氣損傷殆盡，至今年春，始由其表兄金舟利君介紹服以黃色素和伐克辛調製而成之內服藥「安敵淋」之後，病象轉佳，的服四盒，濁已尅止，惟身體依然衰頹，故同時再以「生殖素」補其體虛，不到兩月，精神旺盛，面色紅潤，而食慾已增進，體重竟得增加至一十二磅之多，綜計徐君共受白濁之苦三年，始於今春得以根治痊可，可謂幸運之至也。亦足證「安敵淋」之神效。</p>
<p>實非他種劣藥所可與之拮抗也</p>

<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>有羅貴達君，來滬業商已七年矣。彼為蘇州光福鎭人，現年念八歲。彼體素弱，且在四年前，嗜上手淫習慣之後，時罹遺精，上年冬始與王姓女士結婚於故鄉。新婚之後，衰弱之軀，已不堪勝任，如是二月，即患早洩，旋竟陰痿，於是始驚惶失措，服藥多種，竟鮮效果，今年四月底，由朋友陳振元先生之介紹，來余處診治，余診察羅君之生殖腺已受損傷，故以「生殖素」為我主要療治之藥品。因「生殖素」純提煉雄壯動物之生殖腺素而配製，對生殖機能衰弱者，確有挽回壯健的效力。故羅君自得「生殖素」培補之後，情形轉佳，的服兩盒，自覺生機壯健，興趣倍生，彼共服半打左右，一切生殖機能障碍之病，完全澈底根治，不但肌肉結買，且面色紅潤，體重亦增，刻渠已能行美滿週到之性生活云。</p>
<p>再有一患者，受淋病之侵害，以致失却性的能力，彼之病狀，異常惡化，且有頭痛，耳鳴，健忘，失眠，心悸亢進，精力疲憊等症雜共中。而每星期至少有遺精五次，並已染上煙癮，此人自謂永難恢復壯健矣。不料被余用數種有力良藥，竟得死裏逃生。其人名林，浙之長興人，年巳三十四歲，結婚將近八年，余除用「生殖素」挽回其性機能及調理戒除共煙癮之外，並注射「育維賜保命」共二拾CC，同時以黃色素和伐克辛調製而成之治淋效藥「安敵淋」，將其多年頑固之慢性淋病，消滅於一旦。因渠尙染劇烈之遺精症，所以再以「希米脫氏固精片」治之，的共服「生殖素」四盒，「安敵淋」四盒，「希米脫氏固精片」兩盒，竟將此百病叢生之林君，根治痊愈，可謂幸矣。</p>
<h3 id="c175">三種早洩的短期療法 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<p>……腦性脊髓性末稍性三種的類別與治療　……根本的療法和應注意各點的澈底認識　……早洩症的弊害與對方所受的痛苦概述</p>
<p>精液早洩症，是一種機能的神經病，但是，它和神經性陰痿是不同的，射精的神經中樞及傳導腺的過敏，是這病的原因，究共促成此原因的主要因素，完全由於全身營養障碍，或在發育期即嗜行手淫惡癖，及先天之不足及後天之失調等。其他重病未完全復期，鴉片，嗎啡的中毒而發生的，故治療不得不注意共各個的原因和根本剷除法不可。</p>
<p>（一）腦性早洩的病狀</p>
<p>這種早洩，是在神經衰弱性陰萎的第一期發生的，脊髓的勃起中樞受了侵害，在勃起不充分或全不勃起的時候，而射精中樞却先巳興奮，以致發生射精的行為。</p>
<p>按普通的現象，先是勃起中樞極度興奮，其决發生射精中樞的興奮，然後才有射精的行為。但是，當勃起中樞受了侵害的時候，牠還不興奮，而射精中樞却先已興奮起來，以致發生射精。這時如更加上精神中樞的興奮，道現象就更厲害起來，甚至於在白天不勃起也能遺精，此種類別之為腦性早洩症。</p>
<p>（二）脊髓性早洩的徑路</p>
<p>早期射精，除上述之外，因精神的作用，即在腦髓發生强烈的性的觀念之感覺的時候，因受感覺的刺激，也能使射精中樞興奮起來，致惹成早洩，也是習見的事</p>
<p>（三）末梢性的精液早洩症</p>
<p>末梢性的精液早洩症，共原因多係精囊的腫脹及過敏，精囊發生炎症的原因，多由於手淫，或交媾中染及淋症等。因精囊的炎症，遂至害及射精中樞。以上的幾種早洩症，其療法的効果最大者，就中以生殖腺培補的方法最有効。此時應以「生殖素」服之，則生機頓活，精力充沛，可深得對方濃厚的快感，不然對方所受的感觸，眞味同嚼臘了。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<p>— （王士英醫師）</p>
<p>遠年瘋痛救治</p>
<p>患者葛君：長沙人，年四十六歲，商界，葛君因旅途跋踄，飽經風霜雨雪，以致寒溫內蘊，發為瘋痛，痛甚時，如桚如拷，痛苦萬狀，困頓莫明，後經其至戚介紹服名藥「强斯登氏胃痛片」，服後功效顯著，卽安心連服五盒，骨節頓形輕鬆，現雖工作不輟，亦未嘗感覺若何痛苦。據渠云：「余受骨痛之苦，已歷八年，所服關於治療骨痛之藥，已十數種，雖有數種，服後能顯其效力，但停服後卽復發，故結果仍難澈底保障，現自服一强斯登氏骨痛片」五盒之後，情形大相懸殊，蓋余自今春吿愈停服迄今，已逾八月，未嘗復發，此余之所以引為驚奇不置也」云云。</p>
<p>煙癮骨痛回春</p>
<p>再有一患者為女性，且染煙癮，而彼之骨痛早在未成癮之前，因惑于吸煙可减痛苦之綱言，致復染上烟癮，直至今春，為渠之胞姊介紹服「强斯登氏骨痛片」三盒之後，深感骨節輕鬆，霍然而瘳。同時再以「生殖素」戒除其煙癮，故不到四旬，烟癮與骨痛，相繼被兩良藥所一掃而光，迄今五月，從不復發云。</p>

<p>（一）遺精及神經衰弱癥</p>
<p>息者包姓，杭州人，年廿六歲，旅滬已七年矣，業五金掮客。（主訴）——尙未成婚。性的機能通常，不過在排尿時或勃起時，有多量精液性物質由尿道口流出，排尿後，必見粘稠透明之液，現於尿道口外，而於睡眠之後，醒時則精液已淋漓滿褲矣。特別在畫間操勞之後。最近心悸亢進，極度疲勞，記憶力銳减，精神憂鬱，時有耳鳴，頭痛等病發生。（現在症狀）——有神經衰弱症候，攝護腺腫大充血，檢查粘稠性物質，有攝護腺液及多數精蟲存在。（治療方法）——余旣診得共病狀後，除施行電療外，即為之冷却後尿道部，攝護腺按摩，以「生殖素」滋補其體虧，同時再以「希米脫氏固精片」根治其遺精，各服的三盒左右，不到六星期完全治愈。</p>
<p>（二）發育不良包皮過長</p>
<p>患者徐小泉，年二十歲，居在本埠東唐家弄，裕慶里三號，彼父為一綢莊職員，渠亦在綢莊學業。（主訴）——山十五歲起卽犯手淫，至今尙不能完全戒絕，陰莖織細，睪丸極小，而且雖用手指使包皮翻退時，龜頭亦不能露出，包皮先端僅有一小孔，排尿時，尿先注於包皮間，而後再由包皮間排出，射精時亦然，極度不快，勃起頻繁。夢遺，滑精，頗以為苦。（現在症狀）——陰莖，睪丸，攝護腺等皆發育不良，反射機能亢進，併發神經衰弱症。（治療方法）——先施以局部麻醉，將包皮先端收縮輪部分割去少許，成環狀。縫合，毫無痛苦，然後再以「生殖素」恢復其精力，消滅其神經衰弱症，幫助其發育，並以「希米脫氏固精片」鞏固其精關，治愈其遺精，精神漸决爽快，神經衰弱症盡去，服藥二月後，完全重獲發育，遺精早愈。</p>
<p>名葯實驗</p>
<p>健美成功</p>
<p>余因先天不足之故，雖年至十六歲發育時期，仍然無美滿之發育，乳房痿癟，一切腰臀等處，無美的曲線，加之月經不調，時時愁眉不解，直至上年冬，服一女用生殖素」之後，情狀大變，肌肉頓形發育，胸部乳峯高聳膨大，富有彈性，巳充分獲得我健美之姿態，今夏余數决出現於公共游泳池之後，備受他人之羨贊，此實為余平生最出風頭之日也。鄭志潔</p>
<p>胃病經過</p>
<p>余年四十，雖在中年壯盛之時，因體弱之故，胃腸殊不健全，非但胃痛頻作，而消化力亦甚衰退，故全身榮養不足，精神與精液均感萎靡枯竭。今年四月，由朋友之介紹得服「胃痛　」與「健胃素」後，竟將多年之胃病，消滅無形。可謂幸矣。徐仲達</p>
<p>白帶秘療</p>
<p>余為一體衰精弱之女子，今年廿二歲，出嫁四年，尙未生育，且染白帶，精神大苦，余實無法可想，且漸流業增多，而發奇臭，今夏丈夫與我購得「療帶靈」一盒用之，白帶頓少，不到兩月，下部淸潔異常，祇用去兩盒之譜，可謂其效顯著也。夏素心</p>
<p>骨痛肢痠</p>
<p>余於數年前，即患骨節酸痛，手肢麻木等症，其時雖曾延醫調治，服藥多種，仍無顯效，上年冬發作允烈，竟至半身舉動不便，手肢亦隱隱感覺麻木，余乃大恐，後由朋友介紹，得服「强斯登氏骨痛片」，的共三盒，竟將余之骨痛肢痠完全治愈。迄今六月，從未復發云。</p>

<p>（一）小麥花生芝蔴等、報上所刋之價格、均以百市斤為單位、連袋秤見計算之、</p>
<p>（二）關於各貨之市價、如小麥現在新貨時期、逐日均有行市、花生芝蔴等、時有時無、純以賣買能否接近、及存量如何、始有市價漲落之可言、至於此項貨品、向無專門刋物、如欲明瞭、可參考本報逐日刋布之商業欄、</p>
<p>（三）關於售貨問題、凡小麥等貨品運抵上海、概須委托雜糧行家代售、其經手佣金、為全部貨價百分之一、至若麵粉公會、雜糧公會、為各該業集會之所、根本上不接受委托賣買、卽麵粉廠家、除自辦外、遠路客貨、均為雜糧行家經手、從無直接交易者、大凡委托行家脫售貨品、可以預先指定、或貨到隨售、或限價賣出、行家則依照客家意思為意思、此種委托方法、函電均可、所以一經委託行家後、舉凡人地生疏推銷困難等情、均巳迎刃而解矣、</p>
<p>（四）每一市斤合半公斤、</p>
<p>（五）凡聯運貨品到達後、當然上在鐵路棧房、五天　徵收棧租，惟鐵路棧獲較銀行堆　略大、凡接受委托之行家、可以代為轉棧、至於運費、或交貨站付淸、或到達站付、均無不可、銀行堆棧、棧費每包每月四分、不滿一月、亦作一月算，</p>
<p>（六）小麥花生芝蔴等、目下均無捐稅、</p>
<p>（七）運費、如交鐵路聯運、在交運站方面、當有定章、可以就近詢問、若托轉運公司交運、從事實着想、當較鐵路聯運略大、此則可向當地鐵路或轉運公司接洽比較之、</p>
<p>（八）裝運損失、此種情形、在所難免、如委托聯運、比較省事、走漏或可略少、</p>
<p>（九）卸費、貨品到達上海後、卸車進棧、每噸二角、出棧時同、</p>
<p>（十）大量運輸、不論多少、鐵路均有定章、無優待可言、至整車裝者為四十噸、另噸亦可托運、但拼車較為困難、</p>
<p>（十）（一）運銷、各貨當然可以各地運銷、但仍須委托各當地之行家、例如貨到上海後、須有接收提單之行家、方能扞樣脫售、凡遠道貨品、委托經售、可在當地之銀行押匯、大的照貨品市價、六成或七成之間、其餘貨欵、俟貨脫後、再由經手行家續匯之、經手行家、除應得百分之一佣金外、他如過期棧租費、上下卸力費、轉棧費保險費賣出過秤費及押匯利息匯欵費函電費、均須客家　擔，由行家支付之、</p>
<p>（十）（二）裝車時間、凡各貨經起運站聯運後、如無特別事故、當有規定到達之　點、大約　多四五天可由貴處裝到上海、但貨在起運站、能否卽時得着貨車、則難以預定、</p>
<p>（十）（三）至若市價之趨勢、所謂早晚不同、殊難預測、因所列各種、與國際貿易、動有關係、可以檢閱本報逐日商情、當能舉一反三、如欲確知該物之市價、不妨將樣品寄投本報、當樂為介紹該業中人、藉明眞實狀况、庶知貨品有高决之別、不能純以巿價為準則也、</p>

<p>論西湖六月清涼，只在深夜；白畫水氣蒸日，鬱注不化、浮波漫岸者，莫非炎風；洪爐喘息，蒲扇無靈，此苦非久客者弗能知。湖為蓮藕藪，紅笑素泣，最豔盛夏，然困於酷日，亭午巡視，委悴亦殊可憐也。故余曩年雜詠有：萬木中暑哭淸蟬，一絲香續湖山命之句。向晚，螢火流紅，吳山一帶，薄有涼意矣。而湖面風生，猶陣陣中人作噁，故旅居浮艇，必待草頭露滋，及子夜鐘脫林淸響始發。緣露重則餘熱渟掙，月生而潛陽消散也。其時，亂山伸頭，吹樹送涼，萬荷挺腰，分香搖綠；覺四圍雲水，都通人意矣。湖明淡肥，透澈如琉璃瓶，紅白花凌亂雜生，宛然天成淸供之妙品。獨客以外，亦有挈眷喁話翠蓋間者，望之神仙不啻。「雲　偎貼寂無譁，正是銀河夜泛槎，月下鴛鴦三十六，香涎墮水活荷花。」我慣飄零，自泯妄想。惟細領凈植，忽然有悲耳：嘗謂蓮固花之君子，而亦可喻為薄命才人，容華外豔，苦心內蘊，一夏開謝，郤為誰悅？念物之無知，益動我悽愴之感。蘋末風緊，積露隕淚，趁疎星縣棹，葛薄若不勝寒也。</p>

<p>— 君美</p>
<p>在第一次發現了一根白髮之後，我要感嘆着來日無多而覺得自己快要衰老病死了，雖然現在我還不到三十歲，但過去的光陰是那麼像夢一般的一剎那</p>
<p>一天到晚，奔走呼號，像狗一般跳，貓一般呌，思慮，苦悶，盤算着一家衣食住的，白髮愈是會一根一根不絕如縷地生出來，那茶在手頭，食在口頭，擁着嬌妻艷妾，無思無慮，沒有一些心機的，白髮卻不敢透出一些些來，它非但會捉弄人，而且也很勢利。</p>
<p>歷史上有名的白髮，一個是歷國時代的伍子胥，因偸過昭關一夜而焦灼得鬚髮皆白，一個是三國時代給諸葛亮「蒼髯老賊，皓首匹夫！」頓罵氣死的王朗，這二個人，前者因了白髮，而後來還立了許多大事業，替父兄報仇，造成吳國一時的強盛，後者則受不了白髪的漫駡，活活的犧牲了性命。</p>
<p>頭髮的變成白色和神經作用，確是很有關係，路易十六世王妃在受着宣吿死刑之後，苦悶不堪，到明天黃金頭髮，都變成白色，這是有名的史實，還有德國某處坍倒房屋，一個女子因恐慌太甚，頭髮眉毛，都成白色，那麼伍子胥一夜髮白的話，似乎也不盡是無稽之談。</p>
<p>淸初錢牧齋娶柳如是，一則皤啼白髮，一則粲粲紅顏，大有一樹梨花壓海棠之概，但兩人情好彌篤，一天牧齋目注如是，如是問曰：「公胡我愛？」曰：「愛汝之黑者髮而白者面耳，然則汝胡我愛？」如是曰：「卽愛公白者髮而黑者面也。」想不到白髮遙遙數千年，居然也得到一個一代美人的知己，為白髮吐氣不少。</p>

<p>這兩天寒暑表的水銀綫，又在上升了，快要爬近一百度，跟着赤膊的人，也就多了起來，赤膊雖然是國人的惡習慣，然而苦力熱起來的難過，也同富人大便急時，而不許登厠，一樣的難過。</p>
<p>溧陽處京杭國道的中心點，行政當局，厲行新生活，赤膊當然也要取締，善勸恐不能使其從，處罰又似乎太苛，乃取蓋印辦法，派警務人員，帶着墨水，携着「羞恥」印，上街巡視，遇着赤膊朋友，就在皮肉上蓋上「羞恥」二字，雷厲風行，半裸體的陳列，也就減少了些，也有莫名其妙的鄉下人，認為近於侮辱而起衝突的。廣貨店家，汗衫，汗背心，同時就吿個缺貨。</p>
<p>謔者謂蓋羞恥印在赤膊人身上，同屠宰稅人員，在猪肉上蓋「騐訖」印，有些相像。但是苦力為了顧着羞恥，又要吃飯，兩難兼顧之下，祇好節省吃的錢，而用在穿上，買件汗背心穿起來，終日給汗濕浸着，沒有辦法。</p>
<p>警務人員，為追着赤膊朋友蓋印，因而聽着某米行樓上的麻雀聲，無意中抓着賭客，此又為蓋印而引起的趣聞，可見我國人有閑的仍是有閑，會消遺的，仍是會消遣。</p>
<h3 id="c202">蹦蹦戲在上海 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>蹦　戲的發源地，是在　山，但是盛行的所在，卻在瀋陽。蹦蹦戲的音調，因此最會於關外人的口味，瀋陽的蹦蹦戲塲，每天總是擠滿了聽客。</p>
<p>自從張作霖入關。奉軍佈滿了平津，為投共所好起見，平津便有了蹦蹦戲院。以前的蹦　戲，很是簡陋，除了主角是一個坤伶以外，並不似現在般的有很多配角。侵襲到了平津之後，方逐漸改良，所演的戲，也有了整本，粗具了規模。</p>
<p>蹦蹦戲勢力的南侵，來到上海，第一個便是朱寶霞紫霞姊妹，出演於新世界飯店。也是從了　霞和紫霞的技藝精湛，得到海上人士的贊美，蹦蹦戲在上海，方有似今天般的優越地位，所以朱氏姊妹，實是蹦蹦戲發揚到上海來的唯一功臣。</p>
<p>朱寶霞去後，接著到上海來的蹦蹦坤伶，尚有芙蓉花，愛蓮君，白玉霜，張彩蘭，鈺　芝，和現在初來上海的　彩運。淪各人的演技，雖不無可取，但是比了朱寶霞的色藝，總覺得有小巫見大巫之分，這是朱的天才和技藝，都勝人一籌的表示。</p>
<p>到了現在，蹦蹦戲的勢力，差不多已充滿了上海。較大的遊藝塲，沒一家不把蹦蹦戲作為吸引遊客的先鋒。大世界佔着首席，不惜巨資，聘的是朱寶紫紫霞姊妹。先施樂園，是鈺靈芝，張彩蘭，白玉霜亦有秋涼再來之說。最近又有喜彩蓮的來滬，試演於天蟾舞台。在上海的蹦蹦班子，無疑的，已勝過了平津。在這幾個蹦蹦坤角之內，伊們的演技，除了喜彩蓮外，都會和上海人見過，可以得到以下的評論。</p>
<p>白玉霜所做的戲，祇有馬寡婦開店，淫惡鏡，潘金蓮，閻惜姣等一類戲。其餘諸伶，本不是蹦蹦坤伶中的第一流人材。最滿意的，自然是朱實霞，表情唱工，喜怒哀樂，無一不佳。有時演蕩戲，亦能樂而不淫，含蓄不盡。因此朱在上海，不知風魔了多少觀衆。</p>
<p>現在來的喜彩蓮，上海人沒有見過她的色藝，聽說資格甚老，年齡僅亞於白玉霜，大的在二十七八之間。伊的丈夫，名呌李小芳，同台演唱，寸步不離。在天蟾試演，如果有呌座力，或者有進大新游樂塲的可能。</p>

<h3 id="c203">日本兒童的玩具 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>玩具是兒童的恩物，沒有一個小孩子不喜歡的。日本的玩具工業　已佔世界第一位，我國兒童們所購買的玩具，十之八九是日本貨，。日本人自己也說任你世界各國，加高關稅壁壘，或是排斥日貨。但是天眞的兒童，只知道自己好玩，沒有什麼經濟政治作用的。日本玩具的所以能夠風行全球，便是他們的玩具，能夠抓住兒童的心理之故。　現在日本玩具最流行的是戰爭化的東西，這也是環境使然的。飛機，戰車，槍砲，在無形之中使兒童心理，漸漸有喜歡戰爭的傾向，對祖國帝皇只知服從信仰。此種玩具以鐵皮製造者為多，十分像眞，利用彈簧轉動着。戰車槍砲，裝着電石，都能發光發聲。木製的雖不能目動，但是不易損壞而且價值較廉。我國時常想模仿日本的玩具，而日本也將我國的玩具如竹龍，發聲蟬等倣造之後，運銷到南洋羣島去。</p>
<p>賽璐珞的洋囝囝及響鈴，是三四歲嬰孩的玩具，沒有發聲自動的洋鐵玩具銷路大。橡皮製造的牛馬，銷路漸促，我國也可以製造了。玩具的價值，過了一元以上便不甚合宜。一兩角錢的東西，反而可以到處風行。我國所製的玩具，價格既大，出品種類又少，還難與日貨競爭。日本各地都有鄉土玩　，利用貝蚌螺殼，製造文具玩具，也成了一種副業。</p>
<p>日本兒童可以有許多價廉的畫書，上面全是軍國主義的材料。如日俄中日戰爭的故事，以及未來大戰的理想圖畫。因此日本兒童的忠君愛國思想，並不落於成人之後。此種畫報已有中文解釋，將推銷於東三省及華北。另有一種是附有南洋土話的，是專銷於南洋羣島一帶。愛護兒童的父母，對選購玩具的時候，應當注意其玩具的寓意，以含有教育意味為宜。而一方面希望玩具公司製造適應我們現在需要的玩具，勿專以盲從模倣為自足。</p>

<h3 id="c205">陳濟棠忌諱十三號 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>陳濟棠下野後，原居麥嘗奴道十三號，陳以西俗忌十三，故於八日下午三時，偕陳維周莫秀英等，遷居利園佛學會，其實陳本來不吉，所以到麥嘗奴道十三號去住，並非住了十三號方纔不吉也，故人事之吉不吉，十三號與十四號有甚麼關係？</p>
<p>十三數字之不吉，卽我國亦有此說，正月十三，二十一，為楊公忌日，是日生出兒子，必定討飯，此十三數之不吉也，又龜文亦為十三，故人往往以十三塊為取笑之資料，其實神龜千年，何嘗惡物，卽正月十三所生，而結果並不討飯者，此比皆是，並非正月十三所生，而專以討飯為生活者，反居多數，我國人迷信之深，於此可見一斑。</p>
<p>故陳濟棠之不吉，實與十三號無關，陳濟棠第一個大不吉，便是不受中央命令，儼成割據之局，第二個大不吉，便是搜刮民脂民膏，盡作個人私產，第三個大不吉，便是橫征暴斂，重苦我民，第四個大不吉，便是聽信妖言，妄自尊大，陳濟棠之不吉，便在以上四事，與十三號何關。</p>
<p>最可笑的，陳以中國之人，而信西俗之迷信，更屬愚傎假定印度南洋諸俗，有聞鴉噪而磕頭，有見長蛇而跪拜者，陳某亦將從其俗歟，房屋十三號之多，莫多於本埠，路有路的十三號，里有里的十三號，我從不聞十三號的房屋無人居住，也未聞居住之後，有所不吉。</p>
<p>總之陳濟棠此次之倒霉，實倒霉於迷信，而倒霉之後，迷信之念，依舊未除，還是迷信，陳氏眞至死不悟者矣。而次日電傳，謂陳濟棠氏已乘外輸出洋，則十三號不吉之說，原屬托名，不過欲借此以溜之大吉而已。然則陳氏原是老奸巨猾，被他瞞過世人耳目不少。</p>

<p>— 方舟</p>
<p>所中藝徒，無故不能請求出所，亦不能擅自離開該所一步，如欲至後面去大小便亦須領取證章後方准出去。但有疾病時亦准謂假，由其家屬領回醫治，藝徒中有疾病者，重則送醫院，近則在所請醫診療，並通知其家屬。</p>
<p>入所的手續極為簡單，只要是十二歲以上十六歲以下的貧苦兒童，都可請求人所，但須確實貧寒，及能覔得本埠殷實保證者為合格。不過所裏有一定額子，在額滿時，該所可以拒絕請求。</p>
<p>那位管理員邢君，在接待室裏和我談了很久，我抬頭看到壁上有一張史量才先生的遺像，史先生逝世後，曾有一筆欵項移助於該所。</p>
<p>工塲裏的上課鐘響過了之後，邢君便陪着我到各部裏去參觀了一週。第一個是金工部，那是一個機件材料的製造廠，那里有幾十只摩達，每隻摩達旁均有三四個藝徒在工作，另外還有一位技師及幾個助教在指導教授。第二個是電料部，那里出品的是鉛皮錢腳，圓木及匣子板等。第三個是泥塑部，這兒有十多個藝徒在模型裏刻着各種泥人；有的在做手裝腳，有的在開相畫眉，有的在上粉塗油，有的在加鬚配衣，大家都在分工合作，據脫他們所用的泥料也是由無錫裝運來的。第四個是竹器部，這里的出品是各種粗細的應用竹器。第五個是籘器部，那里除籘榻籘椅外，也有摩登式的籘製器具。第六個是縫紉部，除了專做自己所裏藝徒的服裝外，便是製給泥人穿的小衣服。第七個是裱畫部，專門裝池裱畫等工作。第八個是西樂部了，那是在樓上的一個房間裏，每天祇學習兩小時。</p>
<p>國文，算術，簿記的教室在樓上，他們最高的年級為六年級，而程度卻參差不一，因為進所的藝徒們，有的已有高中程度，有的卻甚至目不識丁，，並且所裏的教師也只能夠祖任一點普通課程</p>
<p>這些地方都去參觀過了，邢君又引我去參觀了膳廳，臥室及儲藏室等。</p>
<p>臥室在樓上，是在個很大的樓面上排着一百四十隻單人鐵床，空氣光錢都很充足，外面一個小房間是有傳染病的人居住的，再前進是職員的臥室。隔壁是教室傍邊便是儲藏室了，室里堆着的都是藝徒們的衣服。</p>
<p>膳廳在後面；這個膳廳很大，里面足夠容一百多個人同時用餐，它的傍邊是一個老虎灶。</p>
<p>全所的空氣很好，各處空地上全稱有花卉樹木，尤其是幾個荊萄架上，掛滿着纍纍然的靑葡萄，十分可愛。</p>
<p>走的時候我向邢君討了一份該所的章程。</p>
<h3 id="c207">學徒小偉 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 瑞乏</p>
<p>「小赤老，做事體　不小心，你飯會得吃麼？燙死呀嘸人管。小猪　…」</p>
<p>木匠店的學徒小偉，剛燒好了中飯，提着水吊到老虎灶泡了開水來給老板泡飯吃。水吊里的水是剛開的，一股熱氣從那蓋里衝上來，小偉一個不常心，把手放達一點，水吊就從卓邊翻下來，那熱燙燙的一壺水，正好倒在他的左腳上，這引得了老板的發怒，張着兇狠狠的眼睛就是一陣怒駡，要不是手里拿着一隻飯碗正在吃飯的話，說不定就是一個耳光打過去，這時的小偉只好忍着痛，紅着圓圓的眼眶兒拿起水吊再上老虎灶去了。</p>
<p>小偉那冬天生凍瘡，夏天生疥瘡的腳，給那麼一壺滾騰騰的熱水倒下去，馬上就浮起了一個個的水泡，雖然下午老板出去做活時他偸偸的去塗上了一點點豬油，但在這大熱天，猪油好像失去了效用，水泡一個個的破了，五個小腳趾，一個個腫得像豬尾巴一樣，一陣陣不可忍受的痛，從腳底一直的好似痛到頭上，但他只可忍受着，小眼睛含着淚水，一句話也不敢說，還是照樣的操作到晚上十一點，才爬到閱樓上躺下。</p>
<p>「痛嗎？小偉。明早去弄點藥抹抹就好啦！」</p>
<p>老板晚上是不在店里住的，店里只有小偉和另一個已經滿師的學徒阿輝。他看看小偉躺在地板上那樣低聲的哭着，同情的慰問他。</p>
<p>小偉今年才十四歲，他在這木匠店中做學徒，已是二年了，當初要來做學徒的時候，小偉的母親是托了人來向老闆求情的，雖然做學徙不會有什麼好出息，但在小偉的母親看起來還是一件好差事，只要吃多幾年苦，孩子就可以做木匠掙錢來養家了。小偉也高興，做學徒總比跟着母親在餓飯好些。</p>
<p>小偉來到這里做學徒，每天所做是燒飯，掃地，開關店門，買東西……那些工作，本來是阿輝做的，小偉一來，一切就都輸到他了。二年以來，他祇有看着老闆和木匠師父等在做工，卻從來沒有人教他這項手藝是怎樣學習的。</p>
<p>「要孩子好是要呌他多吃些苦的，」這是一般老闆教學徒的金科玉律，也就是所謂「吃得苦中苦，方為人上人」的人生哲學了。小偉到木匠店來經過了二年的磨練，把個已是十四歲的孩子，弄得像一隻瘦猴子，笑和哭的影子，都在那一個小臉上消失去了，呆呆的總是那一副表情。</p>
<p>有了這麼二年的經歷和教訓，像這樣燙了一隻腳，他自然懂得應該怎樣忍耐的，第二天一淸早又起來做工作了，那腳比昨天腫得更厲害，濃水在流着，但痛只好由它去痛，工作是不會因此做少些，同時當着老板的面要裝得一點也不痛的樣子，以免老板又是一塲駡，師父們問着他腳怎麼樣啦？他祗回答着：「不要緊」，但那回答的聲音中，卻帶着一點顫動。</p>
<h3 id="c208">那一天晚上 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 卓爾</p>
<p>給一個夜校里的些孩子們排完了戲出來，已經快要十一點鐘了，雖然疲倦困憊了我，因為給她們一齊走着說笑的緣故反而覺不到什麼，后來，漸漸地她們一個個地笑迷迷地說了聲『明朝會』就轉向別的路上不見了，那時我心里眞有一種說不出來的滋味，孤單，寂寞，像是被幸福拋棄了的一個晚年的老者，我幾决的想說：你們不能再陪我走一段路嗎？——僅僅地一小段，或者再跟我走幾步吧！但她們都是那樣的在臉上明快的笑着，堅决的扭轉了身子……我疲倦了。</p>
<p>走吧，還是自已走吧！</p>
<p>柏油路靜靜地伸展到遙遠的前方，隱沒在黑暗里，廣寬的街上沒有一點騷動，沉靜的像一塊鐵，而我沒想什麼，甚至於我沒有想怎麼走路，只是兩個肩膀掮一顆沉重的腦袋，莫名其妙的走動着。轉過了每一條我所孰悉的街，它們都是那樣扳着一張冷酷的臉，好像是在說：快滾蛋吧！這個世界不是屬於你的</p>
<p>這於我有什麼關係呢？我輕微的笑了。</p>
<p>走上了一條碎石子路，這是直通我所經的那弄堂的一條路了，它刺疼我底腳，每决我都視為這是加於我的一種痛苦的非刑。路兩旁的人行道是早已給勞苦的弟兄們據為幸福的睡床了。</p>
<p>越是離家近了越覺得路子遙遠，和加倍的疲乏，走到了門口，我竟覺得睡在地下會比走上樓去倒在亭子間里還要舒適的多了。</p>
<p>我慢慢地，輕輕地走進了門。</p>
<p>我慶幸我並沒有看錯，在樓梯口確是有一個陌生的人縮在那兒「你是誰呢？……」我有氣無力的向那個問了，他一聲也不嚮，這時使我威到了幾分恐懼，經我意識到自己確有可以對付一個人的力量時，我反而安心了「你是幹什麼的」？我大聲問了，同時我擰開了燈</p>
<p>那個慢慢地站起來了，他是一個瘦小的斑白了頭髮和鬍鬚的老人，蒼白了臉，佝偉着身子，在破爛的衣服里露出來的手臂是那樣的消瘦，並且在起着劇烈的抖戰，他張了張嘴，但是他因為過度驚慌的原故並沒能講出一句什麼話來</p>
<p>「找誰」？</p>
<p>「老板……老板」那老人作着作揖的樣子顫聲的說的阿拉，「阿拉，……阿拉弗是壞人，……阿拉來此地尋一個性劉格，……弗曉得伊搬塲來，阿拉……阿拉……」他幾乎要跪下去了。說着他自己掀起了衣服，表示他沒有偷什麼東西</p>
<p>我曉得他是什麼樣的好人，我更討厭他那卑鄙的樣子，吾一點兒也不覺得他可憐，我沉了一會，用冷板命令的口氣向他：滾蛋吧，只要你敢再來……」他很快的便溜出去了，我聽見他在弄堂里咕鼕地咕鼕地跑遠了。</p>
<p>踱上了樓梯，一眼便看見我的屋門廠開了，我進去檢點一下一套衣服，和在寫字台上擺着的五隻角子不見了，那靠街的我關好了的窗子已經打開來了。</p>
<p>我趕下樓去，穿過了弄堂，除了死一樣的寂靜之外又有什麼呢？</p>
<p>像是在夢里，我隨入了迷惘中，彷彿踏在棉花堆上我向街上跑去……。</p>

<h3 id="c209">在山峽的廟中 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>—山行雜記之二</p>
<p>我們從星文縣趕到大龍山南邊的山腳下，天色已經垂暮了。在一條狹窄的小路上，我們遠遠地望着夕陽在大龍山的山峯上映着它一天最後的光芒的時候，我們心裏都慌了，還不知道今天晚上下宿在什麼地方。</p>
<p>終於，在一條山峽中給我們找着住處了，那是一間破敗的和尚廟，外表看來它是那樣地小，可是一踏進這廟的大門，卻使我們驚住了，空洞，高大，陰暗的氣息，眞呌我們汗毛管直豎。一個有十餘丈高的靑面獠牙的菩薩，睜着一對可怕的凶橫的眼光怔着我們，我們四個人站在他的面前，是顯得那樣地渺小啊！抬頭看不見屋樑，四壁給常年的香火薰得漆黑。大殿上沒有一個人，我們東張張，西望望，大家都說不出一句話來。</p>
<p>一會兒，一個禿頭的小和尚從大殿的後面走出來了，他用着驚異與膽怯的眼光望着我們。我們吿訴了他的來意後，他便將我們領到後面院子裏一間屋子中住下了。這院子簡直比大殿上還要陰深可怕。有幾間屋子中，都停放着黑大的棺木，從那結滿了蜘蛛網的小窗中望進去，每口棺木前面都有着一盞跳動着恐怖火熖的菜油燈。</p>
<p>小和尚替我們拿來了一壺茶與一盞洋油燈後，便走了。我們聽見他『嚓』的一聲關上了前面屋子的門，將我們孤獨地扔在這大院子中。這時，我們的心裏都不禁膽怯了，到這深山荒野的古廟中來下宿這還是第一次。我們幾乎疑心我們是走進了魔窟或者是匪區。大家坐在暗淡的洋汕燈下都不敢上床入眠，年長力大的老李握着雙管的獵槍儘對着門，要是一有着不對的話，就預備開槍，我和另兩個人，手中都緊提着一把切麵包的小刀。</p>
<p>屋外，不時地括過了一陣狂風，捲着樹葉沙沙地響，大院子裏面籠罩着憂鬱和恐怖的氣息。從山峽中時而傳來了可怖的呌聲。我們其中一個人提醒着我們：『聽，這是山峽中的老虎的呌聲啊』</p>
<p>大家給他這麼一說，更是膽怯了。夜還未深，窗外昏昏的月色，正踱上了樹稍。我想這長長的愁夜將怎樣度過啊！而且我們明天又要趕路的，一夜不眠，明早翻山過嶺，精神自會不濟的了。於是老李提議：「不如將前面的門敲開呌小和替我們在前面找一間房子住，明天多把他幾個香錢，不然，睡在大殿上也是好的！」</p>
<p>我們大的敲了半個多鐘頭的門，屋子裏面方有了動靜，小和尚顫抖着聲音問道：「先生，先生，您們要做什麼呀？」</p>
<p>我們吿訴了他，我們敲門的意思後，小和尚卻堅持着：「先生，請您們原諒，原諒，我們這前面屋子裏面一概不能留客人住宿的，　他幾乎急得說不出話來：「我們的禪丈到南昌去募緣去了，他臨走的時候曾這樣地關照我們？」</p>
<p>我們停止了敲門，用着和藹的聲音哀求着他，並吿訴他我們是好人。</p>
<p>「先生，先生，我知道您們是好人，」他的膽子比較大一點了：「我們這廟裏，一月前被三個客人搶刦了一空，我們的禪丈被打傷了胳膊，這次，禪丈到南昌去，一面去化緣，一面去看傷的，」他的聲音近於哭訴了：「先生，我們這前面屋子實在不能留客人住宿，請您們原諒，原諒，</p>
<p>沒有辦法，我們只好依舊回到這大院子裏的屋子中來，隱隱地聽見了小和尙在前前面的星子門上又加上了一道門。</p>

<p>當阿比西利亞與意大利未開始戰爭以前，美國電影界，已經從事電影新聞網的組織，會經首先以阿國皇宮內外景和阿皇會議宜誓的塲面，收入鏡頭的，便是派拉蒙公司的李卻（Loichey）。後來環球影片公司登高一呼，聯合了幾家公司，集合財力，人力，分組担任攝製工作，凡是有關戰事的區域，甚至在荒山叢林間，也都佈置了攝影機。把守的嚴密，比阿意兩國的前綫還緊張。但從兩國正式宜戰以迄停戰，已經好幾個月了，各國的銀幕上，始終沒有這種新聞放映：有之如派拉蒙公司的「阿國風雲」，僅僅是介紹阿國內部風土，阿皇會議，閱兵，和軍隊的調動，以及各重要官吏的私人生活，至於兩國的交戰情形，則付之闕如。其他影片公司如福司二十世紀，也單獨有福司英　通新聞部組織的阿比西利亞這征隊。由攝影主任籃哈孟領導，可是直到如今，也祇有該公司新聞片中片斷材料，如意軍出發，登船或陸行，以及莫沙里尼的演說，或是阿國軍隊的出發，總之任何公司對阿意新聞，沒有交戰塲面</p>
<p>當然攝照戰塲實景，是萬分危險的，可是當環球公司組織阿意戰事新聞攝影隊時，是準備着一切犧甡的，立誓要把戰爭猙獰面目，一一宣示與電影觀衆，可是結果卻有辱了使命，至於何以攝影隊耗費了巨量金錢和人力，興忽忽的在屠　　　　　　　　，至結果是一無成績呢？</p>

<p>「狂歡之夜」己經全部結束了，這是秋涼以後行將公映的大批國片之中受人注意的一片，史東山表示有數十位親愛的同事都會經為這片子下過不小的心血，假使這片子在將來眞得到多少好評的話，這功勞是屬於大家的。的確「在歡之夜」在製作態度上顯得非常鄭重，而各個職演員沒有一個不是對自己引起重視，大家幾於忘記了一切來從事這片子的工作的。舉一個例：顧而已在「在歡之夜」裏演一個六七十歲的縣老爺，而他本人卻是二十二歲的小伙子，所以每一次拍戲，他比別人要早到六小時，這化裝在化裝主任辛漢文手裏，就得細細地研磨六小時纔可以成功，假使是每天拍戲，你就想像得到顧而已在這上面的苦難了。但是，顧而已很是興奮，很是快活，沒有一句抱怨過，這便因為顧而已為着他的工作忘記了一切的緣故。由了這個例子推想其他一切人等為「在歡之夜」的努力，是足以證明「在歡之夜」實在不是所可以輕視的國片。現下因開映期近，請大家注意一下子。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Guangxi has dug hundreds of miles of Hindenburg-style trenches along the border, adopting a defensive posture. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Although ships from Guangzhou to Wuzhou risk sailing, business in various industries remains extremely depressed. The Guangxi army is massing at Dawang, 20 miles from the mouth of the Fengchuan River, digging trenches and building fortifications busily. Troops stand guard day and night, as if in a time of war. The radio station there is sending urgent telegrams incessantly. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangxi authorities are issuing auxiliary currency indiscriminately, with each dime worth one copper coin. Purchases start at a minimum of one dime, and prices are soaring. Rice costs 35 to 42 yuan per 100 catties, oil is 3 yuan per catty, meat is 2 yuan per catty, firewood is 3 yuan per load, and salt is 7 dimes per catty. However, rural markets uniformly reject paper currency and have reverted to the ancient practice of barter. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangxi authorities' steps to seal up food supplies include: 1. Grain and rice, 2. Pigs, 3. All kinds of miscellaneous grains. Now the people are unable to make a living, and rice-snatching is rampant. Civilian flights to and from Guangdong and Guangxi have not yet resumed. Only ships from Hong Kong to Wuzhou sail alone, but fares have increased fivefold. Each time a ship arrives in Wuzhou, the docks are full. Some people are even pre-booking passenger seats with shipping companies to hoard and profit. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Since the discovery of the puppet border self-governing army of Li Shouxin in the Chahar-Suiyuan border region, they have repeatedly attempted to invade eastern Suiyuan. After being repelled by Zhao Chengshou's troops, the bandit forces are now concentrating in the Xinhe Xing area north of Shangdu, actively reorganizing internally and planning another invasion. An airfield has now been established in Shangdu, and several aircraft donated by a certain party in Pangjiang have recently been transported there. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain party received a telegram from Suiyuan stating that the situation in eastern Suiyuan is tense. The newly formed Mongolian army of Bao Yueqing, numbering over a thousand, has advanced from Pangjiang to Shangdu and has plans to launch a major attack on Suiyuan in conjunction with the Wang Daoyi unit of the Mongolian Border Self-Governing Army bandit forces. Zhang Hai Peng's puppet army is also gradually moving from Jehol towards northern Chahar. The Suiyuan army is defensively deployed along key locations in Fengzhen, Taolin, and other counties, and has requested joint defense of the PingSui Railway line from the troops stationed in Chahar Province. Prince De, citing financial difficulties in Chahar-Mongolia, has ordered the handling of the dissolution of the former Mongolian Political Council. The previous rumor that it had been reorganized by order is inaccurate. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Information from related sources: Prince De is currently in Bailingmiao to handle the dissolution of the old Mongolian Political Council. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to visitors from Zhangjiakou, the puppet army in northern Chahar contacted Yin Rugeng and other traitors in Beiping and Tianjin before invading eastern Suiyuan, hoping to use military action to cooperate with Yin's scheme to expand the puppet self-government and to carry out a certain party's new intentions towards North China. (11th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Guihua, Suiyuan, stated that there is considerable concern for the safety of Swiss journalist Mr. Bosshard. Mr. Bosshard is a correspondent in China for the German Ullstein newspaper. Two days ago, he went to Inner Mongolia for a holiday excursion. It is heard that Mr. Bosshard was lodging in the house of a Swedish missionary who was on leave to return to his country. The house is located a few miles west of Dolon Nor, right under the sphere of influence of "Manchukuo" in Chahar Province. According to the telegram from Guihua, Mr. Bosshard has been detained there and cannot leave because foreigners are not allowed to enter Inner Mongolia. Therefore, it is generally believed that Mr. Bosshard and other foreigners in Mongolia will have difficulty escaping for the time being. (11th China United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Kazuchi, a staff officer of the Japanese Army Department in Tianjin, said that although the plan for developing the economy of North China has been roughly determined, it requires the promotion of political and diplomatic power. The matter is heavy and cannot be handled by him overnight. Its realization will depend on the resolution of the side issues of North China diplomacy. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources, Ambassador Kawagoe is scheduled to travel north from Shanghai to inspect the situation soon, and plans to convene a North China consular meeting in Tianjin starting on the 20th, inviting Tajiri, the acting Consul General in Tianjin, the Consul General in Qingdao, Nakaura, the Consul General in Jinan, Mutō, and the First Secretary in Beiping, to discuss the various situations in the local area in order to begin solving the North China problem in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

<h3 id="e11">The Issue of Wheat Export Ban <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>Express Daily reported that Japanese merchants purchased over 20,000 tons of wheat in the Yangtze River region to be shipped and exported to Tianjin. There were also large-scale purchases in Tianjin, causing panic among our domestic flour industry. Some requested the Ministry of Industries to ban wheat exports. Rumors said that the ministry was studying banning wheat exports and it might be implemented soon. This newspaper's Tianjin dispatch also reported that the Tianjin Municipal Government, deeply fearing the impact on the people's food supply, instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to investigate and prevent it. I believe that whether or not wheat should be banned from export should be determined by the domestic supply and demand. As for domestic wheat production, according to general estimates, it only supplies flour mills for seven or eight months at most, and five or six months at least. Huge amounts of foreign wheat must be imported every year. It is clear that we rely on foreign wheat for supply. Since it is said to be insufficient, we cannot allow others to transport it out, so banning exports is indeed appropriate. However, flour mills cannot use only domestic wheat to make flour. Even if domestic wheat is sufficient to supply, it may still be necessary to mix it with foreign wheat. Thus, in fact, if there are people who want to buy and sell domestic wheat, it can be appropriate and not necessarily impossible to sell. We can supplement what we want by seeking it elsewhere. From this point of view, banning exports does not seem necessary. However, people's positions are different and their opinions vary. The price of an item is considered expensive by consumers, but producers still consider it cheap. Even among producers, the manufacturing side only hopes that the price of raw materials is cheap to gain more profit, while the raw material production side is afraid that the price will be too low and the income will not be enough to cover the labor and cost. Therefore, they only hope that the price of raw materials is high. Since the rise of industry, agriculture is often unable to compete. The price of raw materials is sometimes controlled by industrialists. For example, when the trading of new wheat flour futures begins, the date of new wheat being available is still far away, but the price is often already suppressed. If there is no certainty about the price of wheat when it is new, how dare they take this risk? Even if not, they must clearly know that the farmers' goods are eager to be sold and cannot be held for long, so they can temporarily wait and see until the wheat comes out. Some even buy and store foreign wheat, which arrives near the time of new wheat being available, making it difficult for the wheat flour market to improve. All of this is nothing more than wanting to make the raw materials difficult to obtain at a good price when they are new for their own selfish purposes. However, the farmers suffer.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is beneficial for farmers if the price of agricultural products when they enter the market is high. At this time when we are striving to revive the countryside, it is not only what farmers hope for, but also what the public wants if agricultural products can be sold at higher prices than before, slightly easing their difficulties. Today, merchants in China are purchasing large quantities of wheat and can buy and sell at market prices, preventing wheat prices from being controlled by one party when it is new, and allowing farmers to sell at higher prices. This is not surprising in the era of globalized commodity markets. Moreover, the price of soybeans is already high, and it is a natural trend that the price of wheat cannot be uniquely low.</p>
<p>The importance of the people's food issue is known to everyone. However, it is also easily used by a few people. Whenever there are changes in the grain market, some people use the people's food as a tool for propaganda. Those who hear it do not examine the details, do not understand the truth, do not consider the pros and cons, and blindly follow and agree that it is related to the people's food and should be handled in such and such a way. This must be distinguished. We should know that since last year, we do not know how much rice has flowed into pseudo-Manchukuo and been transshipped. If we believe that food cannot be leaked out, shouldn't we prevent the leakage, and is wheat the only thing?</p>
<p>Moreover, if we export wheat now, Japanese merchants would not be able to go to the interior to directly purchase from farmers without Chinese merchants buying on their behalf. In the past, Sun Yat-sen witnessed many people starving to death during a major drought in the north, while large quantities of soybeans were still being transported to foreign countries. He once deduced the reason, believing that "under the private capital system, the goal of all production methods is to make money. Because food production is for the purpose of making money, food is transported to foreign countries to sell when it does not have a high price in the country. Because private individuals want to make more money, even if there is a famine in the country and people have no food and many are starving to death, those capitalists will not care." Today, those who are exploring and purchasing for Japanese merchants are indeed the "capitalists" who "do not care." If flour merchants were in the same situation as these grain merchants, they would no longer advocate banning wheat exports.</p>
<p>We should consider for the flour merchants that if they cannot resist the oppression of foreign economies with competitive bidding methods themselves, they should also contact grain merchants and awaken farmers to offer fair and reasonable prices, gather Chinese wheat, make Chinese flour, and use it to supply the Chinese people. If we cannot come up with this plan and only think of exploiting our own farmers, it is truly regrettable. Liu Ruiheng was accused of embezzling public funds. The Capital District Court held a second public hearing on the 12th and legally formed a collegial panel.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Public Hearing of Liu Ruiheng's Case; Liu Did Not Appear in Court; Rescheduled for Retrial <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Ruiheng was accused of embezzling public funds. The Capital District Court held a second public hearing on the 12th and legally formed a collegial panel for the trial. The defendants Tao Shijie, Wu Kangnian, and Zhang Hongxu were all summoned to appear in court, but the defendant Liu Ruiheng still made excuses for not appearing. In addition, witnesses Qiu Kangling, a clerk in the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Health, Zhao Zhenrong, a staff member in the General Affairs Section of the Ministry of Health, and the landlord Chen Yuhua, and lawyer Di Kan also appeared in court to perform their duties. Qiu Kangling was additionally prosecuted by the prosecutor in court for aiding and abetting embezzlement for altering receipts without authorization. The details of the situation are recorded as follows: At 8:45 AM, Judge Gao Weijun, Judge Deng Baosun, Judge Li Wenwei, and Prosecutor Zhang Weidong entered the court in order and took their seats. Lawyer Di Kan presented Liu Ruiheng's telegram, and the judge attached it to the case file. Then, Tao Shijie was interrogated. According to his statement, I started working in the Ministry of Health in September 1933. The retention of funds began before September 1933 and was used to pay for projects. I proposed it, but I had the Dean's approval, and Liu said that as long as public funds were used for public purposes, there was nothing wrong with it. I worked in the General Affairs Section of the Ministry of Health. I don't know whether the Ministry of Health's dormitory is Dean Liu's residence or the Ministry of Health's dormitory because I never went there. I only know that it was sometimes used to entertain foreigners and provide accommodation for staff. The new Ministry of Health building in Huangpu Road has now been completed, but there is no dormitory inside. Wu Kangnian was then questioned. According to his statement, I took over Tao's vacancy as Director of General Affairs in July 1933. I also knew something about the retention of funds, which was for the purpose of allocating project expenses. It was not reported to the Ministry of Health until after this case occurred. Then, Zhang Hongxu was asked. The judge said that the accounts of the Central Hospital have been jointly verified with you. From July 1932 to June 1935, the total amount of retained funds for three years was 148,669.9 yuan, and the retained funds under the name of catering were 2,120 yuan, the revenue from nursing fees was 487.07 yuan, of which more than 300 yuan was found out by Song, and the revenue from miscellaneous foreign fees was 4,604.02 yuan, and 1,250.97 yuan, and a donation of 1,000 yuan, for a total of 6,854.99 yuan, totaling 177,211.96 yuan. After verification, there was no difference from the indictment. Zhang stated in court that there was no difference. The judge also said that the project expenses had also been verified, and there were no differences in the total amount. Zhang also had no objection. Then, witness Qiu Kangling was questioned. In addition to three or four staff members living there, Dean Liu also lived in the staff dormitory of the Ministry of Health on Gonghoushan. Therefore, for the convenience of making phone calls, it was called Liu's residence. Therefore, I sent a letter to the telephone bureau to change the Ministry of Health's dormitory to Liu's residence for no other reason. As for the alteration of the telephone receipts, it was done by the telephone bureau's bill collector. The new Ministry of Health building on Huangpu Road only has a duty dormitory, but no dormitory. Zhao Zhenrong was then questioned. The Ministry of Health's rented house on Gonghoushan was used as a dormitory, with Ji Shan, Yang Chongrui, and foreign consultants living there. Dean Liu and his family also lived there. As for whether the Ministry of Health's dormitory had maids, tailors, and guards living there, I don't know at all. The landlord Chen Yuhua testified that the house on Gonghoushan was rented out in 1929, but the purpose for which it was used was not specified in the rental agreement. I don't know. My father has not remembered because of the long time. At this point, Prosecutor Zhang Weidong stood up and said that according to the testimony of witness Qiu Kangling, the telephone receipts were changed to Liu's residence after he sent a letter to change them. Because this case occurred, it was difficult to claim reimbursement, so he tried to erase the words "Liu's residence" on the receipts and falsely claimed that it was done by the telephone bureau's bill collector, which constituted the crime of aiding and abetting embezzlement in criminal law. He should be additionally prosecuted in accordance with Article 241, Article 336, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 244 of the Criminal Procedure Law. After the prosecutor finished his statement, the judge informed Qiu Kangling of the main points of the prosecution. At this point, the court announced that the defendant Liu Ruiheng was still not present, so the debate could not be concluded. The case was rescheduled for retrial. The court adjourned.

<p>(Washington) The U.S. Department of Commerce today released a report on international trade conditions, praising China's new currency policy. It stated that, on the whole, the new currency policy is progressing smoothly. Although it has not yet reached perfection, the government is actively organizing committees and issuing detailed rules to increase its effectiveness. Since the promulgation of China's new currency policy last November, the banking sector has shown vitality. However, the rise in prices and the value of copper coins has been somewhat unfavorable to the lives of ordinary people. Political stability and the active implementation of economic construction plans are the main developments in the country's 1935 economic plan. Although both have gone through difficulties, they have fortunately been completed. In terms of internal affairs, the country is more stable than in 1934, and the territory under the control of the central government is also expanding. Chinese communism has become a spent force. In the future, the country will promulgate a new constitution to end tutelage, and a democratic political system will surely be realized. (National News Agency telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3 id="e17">U.S. Silver Purchase Policy Becomes a Point of Contention in Election Propaganda, Conflicting Opinions Between the Departments of Treasury and Commerce <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Government officials have different opinions on the effectiveness of the silver policy, which may become a point of contention in election propaganda. The Department of Commerce reported today that the Treasury Department's silver purchase policy in 1935 did not have a significant impact on the country's monetary and credit status. The Treasury Department, however, stated that this policy has been quite beneficial to the monetary and credit status because government purchases of silver have increased the income of silver producers and increased the number of workers in various silver mines. Purchasing silver abroad has also allowed various countries to store deposits in the United States, thereby promoting trade with the United States. The Department of Commerce responded to this claim by the Treasury Department, stating that although the Treasury Department's large-scale purchases of silver increased domestic silver reserves by 365 million yuan, equivalent to 15% of the total silver reserves, domestic gold reserves also increased by 23% at the same time, resulting in an even greater disparity in the gold-silver ratio. The conflict of opinions between the Departments of Commerce and Treasury at this time is quite noteworthy. Prior to this, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Hamilton, had stated the party's position on the silver issue. Hamilton said that the party's presidential candidate, Landon, had opinions in support of the claims of Western silver producers. It has always been generally recognized that the Democratic Party is the silver party, and the Republican Party is the gold party. Hamilton's remarks were probably to curry favor with the silver-producing states. As for the actual results of the silver purchase policy, the Departments of Commerce and Treasury also have different opinions. The Treasury Department stated that most of the silver was purchased from Canada and Mexico, and 21.1% of the country's monetary reserves are silver. Therefore, the Department of Commerce said that the purpose of the silver purchase law has not been achieved. In reality, two-thirds of the goal has been achieved. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>(Washington) According to the arms trade survey released by the State Department for June, the total value of arms supplied by the United States to various countries was $1,807,743.96. Italy purchased $140,300 worth of arms in the last ten days of June, mostly aircraft parts such as wings, fuselages, and engines. Although Japan is carrying out large-scale military aggression in North China and Mongolia, its purchases of arms from the United States were less than before, only $4,487.75. Japan is a modern industrial country, and it should be able to manufacture the arms it needs itself. Most of the military supplies purchased by the Soviet Union were aircraft and aircraft parts, totaling $186,878.82. The Soviet Union is now able to manufacture aircraft on a large scale, but most of the engines it uses still need to be supplied by foreign manufacturers. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Irun: The San Sebastian-Irun front in northern Spain is currently in fierce fighting. The two sides first bombarded each other with artillery. After 12,000 troops under the command of General Mola, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Rebel Army, arrived from Pamplona, they launched a large-scale attack. However, the government troops are putting up a strong defense on the entire front. However, due to strategic considerations, the government troops have abandoned the town of Tolosa, 16 miles south of San Sebastian. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Hendaye, France: General Mola, commander of the Northern Rebel Army in Spain, ordered an attack on the city of Irun in Guipúzcoa province at 5:30 this morning. His troops are advancing from the town of Entella Chai in the north, intending to defeat the government troops in the various military locations from Irun to San Sebastian, and then further occupy Tolosa, the provincial capital. It is reported that the government troops have already withdrawn from Tolosa and concentrated elsewhere, so as not to devastate the area when the rebels enter the city. General Mola has been preparing for the attack on Guipúzcoa province for a long time. His purpose is to occupy Tolosa. This morning, the sound of cannons was heard continuously, and this decisive battle has begun. The troops fighting on the front line are the elite of the Navarre volunteer army, aided by rebel air force, and their morale is quite high. It can be seen from this that today's battle is of great importance to the overall situation of the war. (Havas Telegram, 11th)</p>

In addition, the southern province of Granada (east of the aforementioned battle line) is still in the hands of the revolutionary army. Both places are exceptions, protruding into the other side's positions. (Havas Telegram, 10th)</p>

Prime Minister Quiroga recently told the press that the government will thoroughly investigate this matter, and that he is increasingly optimistic about the general situation of the war.

<p>(Berlin) It was officially announced today that the Spanish government has detained several airplanes belonging to the German Lufthansa airline. These airplanes were intended to evacuate German nationals seeking refuge in Madrid. It was also announced that, if necessary, Germany will send the torpedo boats "Kondor" and "Mowe" to Spain to protect the safety of German nationals and their repatriation. Currently, 4,130 German nationals have been evacuated from Spain, but 1,400 remain, of whom over 300 are unwilling to leave Spain due to economic reasons. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday delivered the Italian government's response to the French draft of the non-intervention agreement to French Ambassador Chambrun. According to well-informed sources, the content of the Italian response is more favorable than predicted by the Italian newspapers. Italy has accepted the French proposal and has put forward the following two measures for consideration: (1) Prohibition of financial assistance to the warring factions in Spain; (2) Prohibition of citizens of all countries from volunteering to serve in either of the warring factions. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The Italian government's reply states that it agrees in principle with the French proposal, but with certain reservations. The points that the Italian government still needs to discuss with the French government will not be disclosed at this time to facilitate diplomatic negotiations between the two countries. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, reliable sources here report that France intends to invite the United States to join the European countries' non-intervention agreement regarding the Spanish Civil War. It is said that German Foreign Minister Neurath stated in a note sent to Britain and France on Saturday that Germany, while agreeing in principle to this neutrality agreement, believes that it must include the United States to be effective. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, the British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Eric Phipps, was instructed on Saturday to visit the German Foreign Office to support the French request for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. At that time, the German Foreign Office argued that the United States should also be invited to join this non-intervention agreement. Political figures believe that the United States would not find it difficult to join due to its current Neutrality Act. It is also reported that the German government also put forward opinions on the method of monitoring the implementation of the non-intervention agreement (one of the three issues raised by Italy) and argued that the citizens of all countries who volunteer to serve in the warring factions in Spain, as well as private donations to aid the warring factions, should be prohibited. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The British and French governments are currently in close contact regarding the French initiative for a non-intervention agreement among various countries regarding the Spanish Civil War. Britain is very welcoming of this matter and has already informed the governments of various countries. France is keeping the British authorities informed of the progress of this matter at all times. It is also reported that the news received from various parties suggests that the French proposal to prohibit the sale of arms, ammunition, and airplanes to any side in Spain has been supported by various countries. Although there are still several points that need to be negotiated, the major concerned countries are on the verge of reaching an agreement in principle. The difficulty felt by several governments is that their aspirations seem to go further than the French proposal. Britain believes that after the agreement is signed, any shortcomings can be added later. The primary concern of all relevant countries at present should be to avoid the dangers of the situation, and the first priority is non-intervention. It is important not to sacrifice practical results by being overly perfectionist. It is hoped that the major governments involved will issue a declaration in accordance with the French proposal as soon as possible, without delay. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: The French Chargé d'Affaires in Britain recently consulted with Sir Mounsey, an expert from the Foreign Office, on the implementation measures of the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War. According to political figures, the British government will take appropriate measures to prevent the transit of foreign arms to Spain. These measures must not conflict with existing British law to avoid amending the law. Political figures also stated that there are currently two main difficulties regarding the draft non-intervention agreement: one is that the Italian government has not yet made a clear statement, and the other is that Portugal requires all countries to guarantee its borders. Regarding the former, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini returned to Rome from his villa in the Province of Forlì last night to take charge, and the Italian response is expected to be sent out tomorrow. Regarding the latter, the government will declare to Portugal that, in the event of an incident, Britain is prepared to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1810 and the League of Nations Covenant. In addition, Britain will also argue that even if a radical leftist regime is established in Spain, the threat to Portugal should not be greater than the establishment of a fascist or quasi-fascist regime. It is expected that the Portuguese government will accept Britain's views. Currently, the Soviet Union and the Scandinavian countries have accepted the French proposal, which is very gratifying to political figures, who stated that Britain will instruct its ambassadors abroad to actively engage with the relevant countries to support the French proposal so that the non-intervention agreement can be successfully concluded as soon as possible. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the draft agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, responsible sources have learned that the Soviet government has given its unreserved support. It has already implemented a ban on the shipment of all military supplies, including military and commercial airplanes, to Spain, as proposed by France. However, regarding the clause in the preamble of the draft stating that each signatory country is willing to maintain strict neutrality, it is proposed that it should be deleted. Since the Italian government has distinguished between the terms "neutrality" and "non-intervention," different interpretations of this statement in the preamble will inevitably arise among various countries. Some countries may believe that this is a permanent recognition of the Spanish government forces and the rebel forces as equal belligerent parties, while other countries only recognize the Madrid government as the legitimate government recognized by the powers. If so, obstacles will inevitably arise in future negotiations, and every effort should be made to avoid this. Responsible sources here state that the French government has no objection to the Soviet views. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the French request to conclude a non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War, only Portugal has not yet responded. It is reported that the Portuguese government intends to put forward the following three reservations: (1) The neutral status of the port of Tangier in North Africa must be respected by both warring parties in Spain; (2) The Soviet Union must accept the non-intervention agreement at the same time as other countries; (3) Britain and France must guarantee the territorial integrity of Portugal (referring to the threat to Portugal's security if communism spreads within Spain, leading to a state of anarchy). Regarding the third condition, people here generally say that Britain's obligation to guarantee Portugal's territorial integrity is clearly stipulated in the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars, Britain and Portugal were allies). This treaty is based on the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1703 (during the War of the Spanish Succession in 1703, Britain and Portugal were also allies, standing against France and Spain). The two are in the same vein, with the same purpose, and the treaty of 1810 is still valid today, with its contents unchanged. According to Article 1 of the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of Friendship, this friendship treaty and the defensive alliance relationship between the two signatory countries, and their close, inviolable, and linked relationship, shall be permanent, firm, and unchangeable, so as to ensure public security, maintain common interests, and when any enemy attacks one of the signatory countries, the two countries shall mutually guarantee to defend it. Article 2 stipulates that if any of the two signatory countries of Britain and Portugal is threatened by an attack from another country, then the other signatory country shall do its utmost to either prevent the outbreak of war or enable the threatened country to obtain fair and complete satisfaction. Britain's obligations are very clear, as can be seen from this. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">New German Ambassador to Britain <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German Ambassador to Britain, Herr Hoesch, passed away in office several months ago. The vacant position has now been filled by General Ribbentrop, appointed by Führer Hitler. Ribbentrop is a trusted confidant of Führer Hitler. He represented the Führer in Britain to negotiate disarmament issues and signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in London in June last year. After Germany declared the abolition of the Locarno Treaty in March of this year, he went to London again to attend the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, where his efforts in negotiations were highly commendable. (Vossische Zeitung, 11th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler has appointed his special envoy, General Ribbentrop, as the ambassador to Britain, a position previously held by Dr. Hoesch, who died suddenly in London. Ribbentrop's appointment is welcomed by London political circles because he has many friends in London. Ribbentrop is familiar with the nature and habits of the British people, and it is expected that he will be able to perform his duties satisfactorily. Ribbentrop has visited Britain frequently in recent years, which is why he was honored with this position, so that British and German opinions can become closer. The establishment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement is almost entirely due to Ribbentrop's efforts. After taking office, Ribbentrop will make it his main goal to enhance the friendship between Britain and Germany. Ribbentrop is 43 years old and joined the Nazi Party only four years ago. During these four years, he served as a commissioner on disarmament issues and then as Hitler's plenipotentiary envoy. Ribbentrop is the son of a military man and is particularly known for his proficiency in several languages. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Overview of the Puppet Troops in Chahar North: Troops Entirely Commanded and Trained by a Certain Country; Politics Also Controlled by Special Service Chiefs <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: Since the puppet troops occupied Chahar North, all news has been extremely suppressed. Travelers are subject to inspection, making it difficult for outsiders to understand the truth. Recently, a person from Chahar North spoke in detail about the current situation and the organization of the local garrison. A brief account of the military and political situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Military</p>
<p>Li Shouxin, the commander of the Puppet Inner Mongolia First Army, is in his forties and is a Mongolian from Rehe Province. He was a former subordinate of Cui Yuwu. During the September 18th Incident, he followed Commander Cui in resisting the Japanese around Lingyuan, Rehe, enduring many hardships. Later, as the situation changed, and under Japanese and puppet pressure, Commander Cui went into retirement, while Li surrendered to the puppet regime with his troops. Most of his subordinates are from Rehe Province. After occupying Duolun, his strength was still 4,000 strong. After several rounds of downsizing by the puppet army, only 2,000 remained, organized into two brigades and one regiment. The first brigade commander is a Mr. Liu, the second brigade commander is a Mr. Yin, and the artillery regiment commander is a Mr. Ding. At that time, they were closely monitored and harshly treated, and the officers and soldiers were willing to revolt. Since the unit advanced to Zhangbei last winter, discipline has been stricter than before, and the puppet side does not seem as harsh as in the past. It was expanded into an army. The third brigade (commander Mr. Wang) is still short of personnel and is currently stationed in Baochang and Zhanyuan areas. The unit's firearms are quite well-equipped, entirely new guns made by Han Linchun (approximately 3,000), and the salaries of officers and soldiers have also increased accordingly. Recently, the puppet side also appointed Li as the mayor of Dehua City (i.e., Huade County), so Li travels back and forth between Zhangbei and Dehua. The puppet side attaches great importance to his military strength, but it is only 3,000 cavalry, 13 artillery pieces, and 8 machine guns. The command and training of the unit are entirely directed by people from a certain country. The first brigade commander, Mr. Liu, is from Shandong and was also a former subordinate of Cui Xingwu. He is extremely loyal and very obedient. He constantly laments the weakness of the motherland. Most of his subordinates are also from Rehe Province. His political skills are also very sharp. He has now been appointed by the puppet side as the garrison commander of Zhangbei, with the brigade headquarters located in Zhangbei. The first regiment is stationed in the Dahulun Baochang area, the second regiment is stationed in the Nanhaoqian Tumu Road (under Zhangbei jurisdiction), and the third regiment is stationed in Zhangbei city. The second brigade commander, Yin Baoshan, is fifty years old, from Rehe, and was also a former subordinate of Cui Xingwu. He is treacherous and has close ties with the puppet side. His troops are stationed in Shangdu, Shangyi, and Kangbao. The third brigade commander, Mr. Wang, has troops currently in the Guyuan and Duolun areas. It is rumored that they are miscellaneous troops from northern Yanqing who were reorganized by him. The artillery regiment commander, Mr. Ding, is thirty-two years old, from Rehe, and is currently stationed outside the west gate of Zhangbei. In addition, there are communications companies, special detachments, and other organizations, all stationed in Zhangbei city.</p>
<p>Yu Ziqian, the commander of the Puppet Border Self-Government Army, is in his forties and from Suiyuan. He previously served as a bureaucrat in the Suiyuan Provincial Public Security Bureau. This spring, he used local autonomy as a slogan and traveled between Zhangbei and Suiyuan. Due to secret contacts with a certain high-ranking military officer of the puppet side, he recruited unemployed military personnel and local self-defense bandits from Sui Province. The gathering place is in the Dahushan area of Qijia Village, Sanbaogou, Er District, Zhangbei (Suiyuan border). There are currently five to six hundred people, with only two to three hundred guns. Recently, after a roll call by a person from a certain country, only 100 shi of millet was issued. The local area has suffered greatly. They are currently awaiting reorganization.</p>
<p>Jin Jiasan, the commander-in-chief of the Puppet Xingya Joint Army Group, is from Fengtian. He previously served as a brigade commander in the Sixty-third Army under Feng Zhanhai. Lin Zhuxuan, the puppet deputy commander, is in his forties, from Lishu County, Fengtian. Zhang Songtao, the current director of the General Affairs Section of Zhangbei County, is thirty-nine years old, from Hebei, and is also a puppet deputy commander. On July 20th, Jin, Lin, and their entourage of more than thirty people secretly went to Zhangbei. Currently, only the name of the army group exists; no soldiers or staff have been seen. It is rumored that they have reached an agreement with the head of a certain country's agency in Beiping. After many days of deliberation, they have contacted the troops in northern Rehe and the border areas, as well as miscellaneous troops. They will soon gather in Chahar North. The number of people is more than other units. The puppet side has agreed to completely incorporate private guns and self-defense group guns in Chahar North. Whether this will become a reality is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Bao Dele'e, the commander of the Puppet Inner Mongolia Second Army, is in his thirties and is a Mongolian from Rehe Province. His team of 1,800 people was newly recruited in Rehe and is currently stationed in the Gonghui Town, San District, Zhangbei County. The puppet side is actively training them, but discipline is not very strict and firearms are not complete. They will not be a major threat in the future.</p>
<p>Wang Daoyi, the commander of the Puppet Northwest Anti-Communist Army, recently organized the Puppet Northwest Anti-Communist Army with the head of a special service agency from a certain country stationed in Dehua. His troops are the bandits of Lv Erxiao. In mid-July, they began to gather in the villages of Erquan Jing Sanyi City in the Third District of Zhangbei. With no food or pay, the local area is completely responsible for their supplies. Robberies occur several times a day, and the population has fled. Due to the unbearable harassment, gentry, merchants, and civilians have requested to be moved to the Shangyi area for reorganization. It is rumored that they will soon be moved to the Shangdu County border to carry out disturbances on the Suiyuan border. As for the number of people, there are 2,200, with 600 horses and 1,200 guns.</p>
<p>Wang Youji, the commander of the Puppet Independent Division, is in his twenties and currently works as a section member in the Puppet Mongolian Public Office. He was an instructor during the incident. He is currently engaging in activities to win over local respected but frustrated military personnel and is planning to organize the Puppet Independent Division, operating in the Haoqian area. He has already gathered more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Bu, the principal of the Puppet Youth School, is a Mongolian, currently forty years old, and serves as the head of the Mongolian Section of the Education Department in the Puppet Mongolian Office. This spring, the school was established, gathering more than 300 Mongolian youth from the twelve banners of Chahar League. People from a certain country serve as instructors.</p>
<p>Political</p>
<p>Zhuo Te Bazhabu is the League Chief of Chahar League, with the League Chief's Office located in Zhangbei County. Under the League, there are three departments: General Affairs, Education, and Security, governing the eight counties of Chahar North (Chahar North originally had six counties, but recently the puppet army divided the three administrations of Shangyi, Huade, and Chongli into counties). Guyuan was merged into another county. The military and political powers of the banner are also controlled by the head of a special service agency from a certain country. Huade County in Chahar North, formerly Jiabusi, was renamed Huade County not long after the incident. Recently, it was renamed Dehua City, not belonging to the Chahar League. Guyuan County, due to insufficient revenue, was merged into Duolun and Baochang counties. The Baochang County Government was renamed Baoyuan County. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Typhoon Sweeps Through Chaoshan; Mountain Torrents Erupt in the Fujian-Jiangxi Border Region; Extremely Heavy Losses in Chaozhou and Meizhou Counties <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Thirteen years ago, Chaoshan experienced a "8-2" typhoon disaster. Coastal villages and fishing boats were wiped out, with tens of thousands of deaths. Civil agricultural losses exceeded tens of millions. Transportation in various places only returned to normal half a month later. The streets of Shantou City turned into a field of silt and rubble. Corpses floated everywhere in the sugarcane fields of Chenghai and Raoping. The stench lingered for several days. People of Chaozhou still shudder at the thought. However, on the eve of "8-2" this month, i.e., August 1st, the Customs had already hoisted a hurricane signal. Scheduled ships to various ports were all stopped in the harbor to shelter from the wind, not daring to sail, numbering more than ten ships. Ferries, fishing boats, etc., terrified by the lingering power of the "8-2" typhoon, hid in the harbor in advance. From the 1st, strong winds and heavy rain raged, with the wind speed traveling at 150-160 miles per hour, heading straight inland to the Fujian-Jiangxi border. The coastal counties are plains, and most of the early rice has been harvested. As the typhoon arrived, the water level on the plains rose two to three feet. Boats sailed on land in various villages, and many highway bridges were damaged. The Chaoshan Railway and the embankment highway were also damaged, making them impassable. By the 2nd, the wind was even more intense, continuing all day. Land and water transportation between Shantou and various counties was completely suspended. Telegraph poles and wires were destroyed in many places, and news was disrupted. On the coast, giant waves were like mountains, with the force of ten thousand horses galloping and drums beating. When the sea waves hit, the water spray rose dozens of feet high. Various cargo store entrances hurriedly lowered floodgates, using cement to seal the door gaps and sewers. In the streets, roof tiles, door and window glass fragments flew in the air due to the wind, falling with the rain, making a crashing sound. Countless pedestrians and rickshaw pullers were struck, their heads broken and bleeding. The terrain below Qilu in Shantou City is like a pot, and the water flooded into people's homes two to three feet deep. Many houses had their tiles lifted by the wind, and the rainwater poured into the houses. A ship from Siam went to Shantou, and a small boat went to pick up passengers, causing two boat capsizings and eleven deaths. No boat dared to sail out to sea heart again after that. On the evening of the 2nd, mountain torrents erupted in Fujian and Jiangxi, pouring down from the Meixian and Dapu rivers, flowing straight into Chaoan City. In less than an hour, the water level on the Xiangzi Bridge rose two zhang. Shopkeepers on the bridge almost could not move away in time. When the flood came, the foam on the wave head was seven or eight feet higher than the water surface, like white silk and city walls, rolling out from the villages, all the people's belongings, such as rice straw, cow sheds, bamboo baskets, water tanks, wooden benches, wooden beds, shoes, clogs, clothing trunks, wooden cabinets, white iron buckets, door panels, and even the thatched grass on the fields, were uprooted and rolled down. Bunches of hemp bamboo, thirty to fifty stalks, with green bamboo leaves, rolled down with the flowing water. There were also bamboo cradles, with months-old babies crying inside, the cradles like small boats, passing over the Xiangzi Bridge surface and heading out to sea. There were also cows, dogs, chicken coops, and chickens inside. All of this was seen after the flood had passed, showing the situation of people in the countryside being unable to escape from their dreams as the mountain water suddenly rose. Many things flowed out of the Han River, not stopping for three days, one pile after another, half floating and half sinking. Looking from the Chaoan city tower, half a li away from the river heart; everyone could not clearly see what was flowing down. On the evening of the 2nd, the strong wind and heavy rain did not stop. The river water had already risen to the outside of the East Gate of Chaozhou City. Each city gate lowered the wooden boards to prevent water, stacking as many as eight pieces. The water outside the gate submerged to the fifth piece. On the morning of the 3rd, the river water continued to rise by more than one zhang. At many places in the Han River and its tributaries, the dikes developed leaks and became dangerous. Responsible persons from the river management associations in each district and township patrolled the dikes day and night, ordering able-bodied men from nearby villages to prepare sack bags, fir wood, and sand to place near the dangerous dikes for rescue. In the afternoon, the river water was turbulent and gradually receding. All electric boats and sailing ships dared not set sail. On the morning of the 4th, the rain stopped and the wind subsided. According to telegrams from Songkou in Meixian and Sanheba in Dapu, heavy rain poured down, the sky was dark, and the river water continued to rise unabated. Because mountain torrents erupted in the Fujian-Jiangxi border region, the mountain water did not follow the old paths of streams and gullies, penetrating into people's homes and villages. The village ground and objects swept away by the water were all gone. All boats dared not go downstream, and highway cars were also suspended. On the 5th, the sky in Shantou had cleared, but the river water had not receded. The disaster situation upstream was more severe than expected in Chaozhou and Shantou.</p>

After a report by Madam Niu Huisheng, chair, Ms. Chen Yi was invited to speak on "The Family's Responsibility for Child Welfare Work." After the speech, the chair proposed an additional motion on "Preparations for Relief of Children During Extraordinary Times," which was handed over to the executive committee of the Child Welfare Association to formulate a concrete plan for effective implementation. Finally, the draft of the conference declaration was approved, and it was decided that the date of the next conference would not be fixed but would be convened when necessary. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, the closing ceremony was held, presided over by Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie. After the chairman delivered the closing remarks, all representatives took an oath to show their solemnity. The conference declaration and the subsequently passed proposals are recorded below:</p>
<p>Conference Declaration</p>
<p>The enduring survival of the nation and the flourishing of the national spirit depend on the continuous efforts of generations of citizens to strive unceasingly. Modern citizens should not only inherit the endeavors of previous generations in seeking survival but must also lead the rising generations in preparing to shoulder significant missions. At this moment when we are united in striving for the revival of the national movement, we believe that educating modern children is the most important and urgent task. In a few years, the responsibility for maintaining the nation's life and promoting the national spirit will rest on the shoulders of today's children. Therefore, in the past two years, we have diligently worked according to the resolutions of the National Child Welfare Leadership Conference, not daring to slacken, hoping to fulfill our mission and realize the expectations of the people. Based on our experiences and observations over the past two years, we deeply understand that in these times of national hardship and economic distress, children not only need our proper education but also our widespread relief and effective protection. The National Government is the leading body for the revival of the nation, and therefore, it deeply understands the fundamental importance of child welfare for the revival of the nation and actively promotes it. Thus, last year, the Executive Yuan decided in its meeting that the 24th year of the Republic should be designated as Children's Year and organized the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, tasking it with planning and promoting practical methods for implementing child welfare and earnestly advocating implementation to raise national awareness of child welfare. Having pledged ourselves to child welfare as our vocation, we should act practically under the leadership of the government. As the National Children's Year comes to an end, we are holding the Second National Conference on Child Welfare in Qingdao to review the past and encourage the future. We also offer our humble opinions for the government's consideration. We have observed that the methods of children's education and all protection measures in modern countries around the world are becoming increasingly organized, widespread, and meticulous, constantly improving, all planned to enhance the nation and increase its power in the future. All members of this association hope that our government will have more progressive child-rearing policies and systematic organizations, issuing orders to provincial and municipal governments to plan, establish, or increase the number of nurseries in rural factories and other child welfare projects, and that all public and private universities nationwide will have social, family, psychological, and educational departments to study teaching methods and train specialized talents to cooperate with child welfare organizations. Furthermore, we hope that the China Child Welfare Association will be assisted so that it has sufficient power to specially hire experts in various fields to conduct research and experiments to guide the national child welfare cause, enlightening the people, so that the great cause of reviving the nation can continue to advance, and the national spirit can be promoted and enhanced. The convening of this conference is of such great significance, and the mission of the attending representatives is even more arduous. Therefore, this conference emphasizes the four words "Child Welfare Builds the Nation" as the guideline for our work. The resolutions of this conference should be handed over to the China Child Welfare Association for practical implementation. The children of today are the masters of the future nation. Whether the future nation is sound depends entirely on whether the children of today are sound. To make the children of today into sound citizens is to lead the future nation to a sound state. We should adhere to this principle and work diligently, day and night. This is our declaration.</p>

<p>Xiao Kunshan in the fourth district of the county is a place where rivers and streams are numerous, and cases of robbery and kidnapping occur from time to time, with Miaogang as the den. At about 10:00 PM the night before last, the four-year-old child Huoguan of farmer Fan Shuquan's family in Xijinggang Township was kidnapped. It was reported that seven bandits came that night, one of whom jumped in first with a bamboo pole, opened the main gate, and the bandits swarmed in, speaking in a local dialect, carrying hand torches and other equipment. The homeowner couple, hearing the noise, fled from the adjacent room, leaving behind their four-year-old child, who was lying in bed and could not be taken away in time. The bandits did not search for valuables but only took the child and left. Before leaving, they stole a small boat from the nearby Fan Shulou family and carried the child westward along the Liu River.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Suzhou: Investigation of the Disappearance of Patrol Officer <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Ma Puzhen, a patrol officer of the Fourth Substation directly under the Dongting Sisong Township Public Security Bureau, suddenly disappeared less than ten days after taking office the previous month. At that time, the Public Security Bureau had no knowledge of it. It was not until more than twenty days had passed before Inspector Zhuang Hongji learned of the situation when he went to the township to investigate duty performance. He immediately reported to Director Zhang, who is now investigating the matter. However, the township is isolated on Tai Lake, and it is unknown whether there are other circumstances. Therefore, Chief Inspector Zhang has been specially dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation to clarify the truth. However, the patrol officer of the substation did not report the disappearance of Patrol Officer Ma for so long, which is highly inappropriate and will be subject to appropriate punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Complaint of Soil Paste Shops to the Yuan Ministry <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The county government was ordered to recover 70,000 yuan in illegal profits from privately increasing soil prices by the Rongtai and other three soil paste shops. It is now learned that the county government originally set a deadline of ten days. Therefore, on the 11th, it issued tickets to summon the managers of each soil paste shop to carry out the arrest and pursuit in order to enforce the provincial order. However, each soil paste shop believes that this increase in soil paste prices was approved by the County Opium Prohibition Conference and was not a private price increase. Therefore, they are unwilling to pay and have filed a complaint with the Yuan Ministry. On the one hand, they jointly submitted a report to the county government, requesting a temporary suspension of the arrest and pursuit before the complaint is adjudicated.</p>
<p>Qingpu: Theft from the Anting Town Office</p>
<p>The Anting Town Credit Cooperative, attached to the Anting Central Primary School, was burglarized on the night of July 13, with a loss of more than 2,000 yuan in funds and grain coupons. A hole was dug in the glass window on the side of the side room, and although the tin box was wide open, there were no signs of damage. Therefore, the cooperative's treasurer, Ma Haosheng, believed it was the work of an insider and reported it to the Xu Gongqiao Public Security Substation. When Branch Director Wang arrived at the scene to investigate, he immediately suspected Jin Wangchen, a teacher at the school. Unexpectedly, Jin is the brother-in-law of Ma Shujingxian. Ma Jingxian had previously won the first prize in a lottery in Shanghai last spring. He became arrogant and thought of covering up for his brother-in-law, so he indirectly implicated Qian Qinghe, a resident of Jiajie Town, as a suspect. He even led the Kunshan County police to search Qian's home across the border, but found nothing. It is said that Qian Qinghe has filed a lawsuit.</p>

<p>Deng Jiqian, a certificate inspector at the County Government's Land Tax Office, reported that his son, Deng Haozhang, and certificate inspectors Zhou Yuedu, Zhou Xilun, Zhu Shuqing, Zhang Huisheng, Zhou Ruru, and six others had colluded to commit fraud and steal grain certificates. The county government summoned them one after another. In addition to Deng Haozhang and Zhou Yuedu, who were detained, the remaining four, including Zhou Xilun, were released on bail. County Magistrate Shan Long will submit a report to the Finance Department for review. Yesterday, the Finance Department issued an order as follows: (1) The county's certificate inspection work must be handled carefully and completed on schedule and reported for verification. (2) All suspects in the grain certificate theft case should be dismissed from their positions and provide a reliable guarantor. Those without a guarantor should be placed under surveillance and a list submitted for review. (3) The original informant should be strictly interrogated and monitored to prevent him from fleeing out of fear of punishment.</p>

<p>Lv Ruizhi, the wife of Sheng Shouchhen, a prominent family in Wu Yi, is 45 years old and currently resides in the Lv residence on Shizi Street. Ruizhi married Shouchhen in March of the fourth year of the Republic. Unexpectedly, after Shouchhen's father, Ouling, passed away in September, Shouchhen frequently insulted Ruizhi. By the sixth year of the Republic, after suffering abuse, she became seriously ill and nearly died. She then sought refuge with her mother's family and lived there for several years. Later, Shouchhen left without saying goodbye, and his whereabouts were extremely secretive. Ruizhi was abandoned for more than ten years, hoping that Shouchhen would repent. However, recently, a relative showed her the Shanghai News from September 6 of the seventeenth year of the Republic, only then did she learn that Shouchhen had publicly entrusted lawyer Zhou Zhonghao to publish an announcement of his marriage to Zhang Ruoyu. It was also learned that his brother, Xunchen, as the head of the family, presided over the wedding. Ruizhi went to Shanghai to reason with them but to no avail. After returning to Changzhou, she hired lawyer Yun Kuiyao to file a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office against Sheng Shouchhen, Zhang Ruoyu, and others for bigamy and abandonment. Shouchhen's brother, Xunchen, was accused of assisting in the bigamy. She requested that the case be heard and investigated in accordance with the law. The prosecutor's office held a court hearing on the 11th, which attracted unusual attention from local people, who went to inquire about the matter.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of summer, the weather here has been unevenly cool and hot, with more rain and a cooler climate. Unexpectedly, since the beginning of autumn, it has suddenly become extremely hot, with the thermometer suddenly rising to 97 or 98 degrees. As a result, seasonal epidemics have also become prevalent. Most frighteningly, the rice fields in various villages have suffered from this autumn heat. Black spike disease has been found in the Dayi Bridge and Wangzhuang areas in the west of the city. This type of black spike disease is highly infectious. Once the rice plants are steamed by the autumn sun, they turn black and die. Measures are currently being taken to eradicate it. As for the various agencies in the urban area, they have announced a three-day suspension of office work. If the heat continues, measures will be taken to extend the suspension.</p>

They immediately dispatched personnel and arrested the gang leader Wang Dejin and Zhang Jinlong. Gu Xiaomanzi, Liang Luren, Liang Luxiang, and women Jiang and Jin were arrested at Taiping Bridge in Xiangcheng. After being detained by the bureau, they confessed to robbing Changshu Zhangjiadian, Zhangmu Bridge, the West Lake area, Suzhou Taiping Bridge, and Jiapu Bridge in Wujiang. They killed two homeowners, claiming that it was revenge in the Sanbaitang area of Tongli. They have now been transferred to the Second District Headquarters of the Water Police. The County Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, believed that the bandits had committed numerous crimes in Changshu and planned to send a document to Suzhou to bring the bandits back to Changshu for trial.</p>

<p>Wolf Mountain in Nantong is one of the famous scenic spots on the Yangtze River. The Zhiyun Pagoda on it is a Song Dynasty building. Two years ago, it was damaged by lightning and fire. The abbots of the Baiyi Temple, Zhunti Temple, and Sanyuan Palace on the mountain, Zhiliang, Wei Yi, Canlian, and Huijun, went to Shanghai a few days ago to raise funds from various parties for repairs. With the advocacy of Zhu Ziqiao, Li Qiqing, Zhang Jingshen, Fei Fanjiu, Wang Xiangwu, Cao Xizhi, Zhang Zhenxi, and others, fellow Nantong villagers in Shanghai donated generously and have already collected a considerable amount. Architect Fan Wenzhao was specially invited to the mountain to survey and draw repair plans, and the Gu Shengji Construction Company was contracted to carry out the repairs. After signing the contract, the repair cost is estimated at 15,000 yuan, with one-third to be paid in advance. Construction will begin soon, with a deadline for completion. It is said that the top of the pagoda will be covered with glass tiles, which will be more luxurious and magnificent than before, and the top of the pagoda will also be fitted with colored electric torches. All ferries passing by at night can see the lighthouse from afar, adding a lot to the scenery of the river.</p>

President Ju also plans to go to Hong Kong after arriving in Guangzhou to meet with Central Committee Member Xiao Focheng and urge him to go to Beijing as soon as possible to jointly manage national affairs. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor's Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>President Ju arrived in Shanghai on the 8th from Beijing. After dealing with private affairs, he went straight back to Wusong. Then, the day before yesterday, he came to Shanghai from Songjiang with his family and stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel. Standing Committee Member Chen arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by train only the night before last and also stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Director of the Education Bureau and Acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, and Director of the Public Security Bureau Cai Jingjun visited and hosted a banquet for Chen and Ju that evening.</p>
<p>Flying to Guangzhou Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Chen, Ju, and others left the Cangzhou Hotel in several cars at about 7:30 AM yesterday and went to Longhua Airport. At 8:00 AM, they took the "Guangdong" amphibious special plane to the south. They do not plan to stop on the way and should arrive in Guangzhou at about 1:00 PM in the afternoon. After the departure of Ju and others, the municipal government immediately telegraphed the Guangdong authorities to inform them. More than one hundred people from the military and political circles of Shanghai came to the airport to see them off yesterday morning, including Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Section Chief Li Dachao, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Xiaotian, Secretary Wang Zhinan, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau and Acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Central Committee Member Wu Kaixian, and friends of Chen and Ju. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also temporarily dispatched armed police to guard the area around the airport.</p>
<p>Chen's Remarks</p>
<p>In addition to Central Committee Member Xiao Jishan, Ju's daughter, Chen's personal secretary Feng Decheng, and attendants also took the plane south with Chen and Ju. As for some of Chen's attendants, they had already taken a French ship to the south on the 8th. Before his departure, Chen told a reporter from the Central News Agency that his trip south was purely to inspect and guide Party affairs in Guangdong Province. The inspection procedures will be decided after arriving in Guangdong. He plans to stay in Guangdong for at most two or three weeks before returning north.</p>
<p>Ju's Remarks</p>
<p>President Ju also told a reporter from the Central News Agency at the scene that after arriving in Guangdong, he will inspect the recent judicial situation in Guangdong Province as a reference for future reforms. He does not plan to stay in Guangdong for long and will return north in two weeks. On the way back north, he will pass through Hong Kong to meet with Xiao Focheng, who is currently recuperating in Hong Kong, and urge Xiao to go north to Beijing as soon as possible to jointly manage national affairs. Foreign newspapers reported that after arriving in Guangdong, he would fly to Nanning to meet with Li Bai to mediate the situation in Guangxi, but this is not the case, and he has not heard of the central government having this decision. As for whether there have been telegrams between Nanjing, Lushan, and Guizhou recently to discuss resolving the situation in Guangxi, he does not know the details. According to his observation, the situation in Guangxi can be resolved peacefully to avoid armed conflict. The newly appointed Guangxi Pacification Director Huang Shaoxiong also plans to go to Guangzhou in the next few days. As for the issue of Chen Jitang's future, the central government seems to be able to give him a nominal position to go abroad for investigation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, for the convenience of merchants in various industries regarding the transportation and sales of goods, yesterday had the Inspection Committee formulate "Guidelines for the Transportation and Sales of Goods During the Inspection Period," for relevant industries to request and consult at any time. The full text is recorded below: Guidelines for the Transportation and Sales of Goods During the Inspection Period. (A) Regarding the Portion of Imported Foreign Goods Stipulated by the Ministry: (1) All factories, businesses, transfer companies, etc., that sell, use, transfer, and transport goods that the Ministry of Finance stipulates should be inspected (attached) must first apply to the Customs for registration and a license. (Note) Violations of this provision will be subject to a fine of more than two hundred yuan but not more than five thousand yuan. (2) When applying to the Customs for registration, the business or company must be certified by the industry association. If there is no industry association certificate, the Chamber of Commerce can certify (factories can also be certified by the Federation of Factories) before the Customs will issue a license. (The Customs charges one national currency for each license issued.) (3) After the goods are imported, if they need to be transferred to various places for sale, you can present the tax payment certificate (commonly known as a pass) to the Customs and request a shipping and sales license before you can start transporting. (If transported by train, you must apply for a tax-paid road transportation certificate.) (4) The shipping and sales license obtained should be sent to the local industry association (or directly to the local Chamber of Commerce if there is no industry association) for storage and registration when the goods arrive at their destination. If you want to distribute to other places, you must report to the local industry association or Chamber of Commerce and request a distribution license. (Note) Violations of items three and four will be subject to a fine of up to 20% of the value of the goods transported. (5) The validity period of the shipping and sales license is determined by the Customs according to the distance of the journey. After the goods arrive at their destination, the industry association or Chamber of Commerce that stored the license will keep it and submit it to the issuing Customs on a monthly basis. As for the validity period of the distribution license, it is determined by the issuing industry association or Chamber of Commerce according to the distance of the journey. After the goods arrive, the original sender must mail it back to the issuing industry association or Chamber of Commerce within three days. (6) All businesses, factories, and transfer companies should prepare books to record the source, sales, storage, and transfer of imported goods separately, for the Customs or the agency designated by the Ministry of Finance to send personnel to inspect at any time. (Note) Violations will be subject to a fine of more than one hundred yuan but not more than three thousand yuan. (B) Regarding the Transportation and Sale of Domestic Goods: (1) When domestic goods pass through Customs, they should be reported to the Customs for a domestic goods transportation and sales license. If the goods still need to be transported to other places for distribution after arriving at their destination, the industry association or Chamber of Commerce should be notified to issue a domestic goods distribution license based on the domestic goods transportation and sales license issued by the Customs. (2) If domestic goods are transported inland without going through Customs, the industry association should be notified. If there is no industry association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce should be notified to issue a domestic goods certificate. (3) When obtaining a transportation and sales license from Customs, you must first register with Customs and obtain a license. (C) List of Foreign Goods that Should Apply for a Transportation and Sales License: Rayon, alcohol, alcoholic liquors and beverages, such as whiskey, brandy, liqueur, gin, Japanese sake, various sweet wines, aniline dyes, dry batteries, rubber boots, canned food, cigarette paper, dried scallops, cosmetics and perfumes, electrical materials, needles, kerosene, diesel oil, various piece goods, rubber tires, rubber shoes, various dried seafood products, caustic soda, sugar.</p>

<p>Regarding the Issue of Silk and Satin Transportation and Sales: Representatives Go to Beijing to Petition. The Raw Material License is to be exchanged for a Piece Goods License. In reality, silk and satin will not be able to be transported and sold.</p>
<p>The Municipal Silk and Satin Industry Association believes that according to the "Measures for Inspection and Clearance of Domestic Goods Piece Goods Woven with Rayon" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, it is stipulated that a rayon transportation and sales license must be exchanged for a piece goods transportation and sales license. However, there are very few silk factories in our country that directly import raw materials and produce and sell themselves. Most silk and satin are transferred and sold to Shanghai by silk merchants and then distributed to various places. If the aforementioned regulations are followed, it will be impossible to transport and sell them. Therefore, the association resolved to send representatives Luo Qinghua, Xu Limin, Pan Runsheng, Wang Jiean, Wu Xingcha, and five others, accompanied by Jin Runxiang, standing committee member of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Ge Jiec臣, director of the Inspection Committee, to go to Beijing. The representatives took the night train to Beijing yesterday. In addition to carrying a petition from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Silk and Satin Industry Association for a personal presentation, the Chamber of Commerce first telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report the matter. The original telegram is as follows: To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: The domestic silk fabrics sold by the silk and satin industry in this city are purchased and resold from silk weaving factories and small-scale machine households. It is impossible to obtain tax receipts from rayon merchants to exchange for transportation licenses. This is the same as the inability of the domestic goods industry to obtain unified tax receipts from inland handloom households and the inability of confectionery merchants to obtain import tax receipts for foreign sugar. We have already submitted a detailed report to your ministry and requested that the domestic silk fabrics sold by the industry be allowed to be released along the way with a certificate from the industry association and exempted from submitting receipts for inspection. However, we have not received a reply, and the Customs and Railway Bureau are firmly enforcing the order, and the industry's freight transportation has come to a complete standstill. This is not beneficial to stopping smuggling, and it is extremely related to domestic silk merchants. The industry has sent representatives Luo Qinghua and five others to the ministry for a personal presentation. We request that the various items presented by Jiang Ri be quickly adopted and transferred for implementation. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Satin Weaving Federation believes that the recent "Measures for Inspection of Domestic Goods Piece Goods Woven with Rayon or Mixed with Rayon" promulgated by the Ministry of Finance pose many difficulties for the transportation and sale of silk and satin in the inland. Yesterday, Wang Jiean was specially appointed as a representative to carry a petition and took the Beijing-Shanghai night express train to Beijing at 12:00 last night to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Tax Department separately, requesting that a flexible approach be approved to facilitate transportation and sales and maintain domestic silk. We now present the association's petition as follows: To the esteemed Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing and Director Gao of the Tax Department: We respectfully read the "Measures for Inspection and Clearance of Domestic Goods Piece Goods Woven with Rayon or Mixed with Rayon" promulgated by your ministry, which stipulates that a rayon transportation and sales license must be exchanged for the piece goods transportation and sales license. Although the original text refers to factories, it is found that there are not many silk factories in our country that directly import raw materials and weave and sell themselves. Most of the silk factories in Su, Hang, and Huzhou are family industries and small-scale silk production, which are transferred and sold to Shanghai by silk merchants and then distributed to various places. If the aforementioned regulations are followed, it will be impossible to transport and sell them, which will greatly hinder domestic goods. The association believes that imported rayon and imported foreign silk piece goods should be handled with transportation licenses and distribution orders. As for the domestic silk piece goods woven in the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, they should be certified by the local industry association and then allowed to be distributed to various places, so that they can be smoothly circulated. This seems to imply the intention of maintaining the circulation of domestic goods amid strict inspections. Therefore, we respectfully request your ministry to quickly order the national Customs to approve our request to facilitate transportation and sales and maintain domestic silk. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Sincerely, Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk and Satin Weaving Federation.</p>

<p>Wang Yingyu Went to Guangdong Last Night</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Wang Yingyu, the newly appointed member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. Due to the sudden urgency of his appointment, he did not bring his family and left alone on the Japanese Empress liner to Hong Kong to handle matters last night at 11:00. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Passing Through Beijing to Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang was originally the director of the Security Office of Shaanxi. According to Wang, he had not heard of his new position beforehand. After receiving the appointment order from the Central Government, he left Shaanxi at the beginning of this month. The vacant position of director of the Security Office will be temporarily filled by Deputy Director Zhang. He arrived in Beijing on the 4th. Due to the suddenness of the time, he was unable to rush to Lushan to pay respects to Chairman Lin and President Jiang for instructions. He stayed in Beijing for three days, made some contacts with the authorities, and then came to Shanghai. Wang is originally from Guangdong and has traveled all over the country for the revolution over the years. Therefore, this time the Central Government has given him this position, and he will definitely make many achievements in the future.</p>
<p>Policy Opinions</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Wang at his residence yesterday afternoon. According to his talk, his general policy opinions are based on practical needs. Guangdong is a part of the entire China. Therefore, the civil affairs facilities in Guangdong Province should be implemented step by step according to the overall plan determined by the Central Government. In the future, in addition to striving to be fair in public service in accordance with the intentions of the Central Government and Chairman Huang, I believe that the most important thing for politicians is to strive for fairness in handling affairs so that the people can enjoy true peace and happiness.</p>
<p>County Administration Facilities</p>
<p>Regarding the facilities of county administration, Wang believes that issues such as personnel and economy should be made public. In the future, in addition to assessing the past achievements of county magistrates, he will also select talented people through examinations. As for the necessary work such as the investigation of household registration, financial management, transportation development, and strengthening of the police force in various counties, officials and people should cooperate, and the people must have a sound organization to complete local autonomy. Other matters, such as banning opium and gambling, should be strictly enforced. There are also other matters. If there are special circumstances in Guangdong Province, they should still be submitted to the Central Government for adoption at any time for implementation.</p>

<p>Zhang Chengyu Went to Guangdong Yesterday</p>
<p>Zhang Chengyu, Director of the Audit Department, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. Due to the hot weather, he felt a little unwell and rested at his residence yesterday. He left Shanghai on the Japanese Empress to Guangdong last night at 11:00. Audit Officer Li Huanbo accompanied him. According to Li, who spoke to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the purpose of this trip to Guangdong is to first inspect the province's finances. The province originally had an audit office, but its scale was relatively large. Therefore, in the future, in order to save expenses, it will be reduced. Now that Guangdong Province has returned to the central government, and no one is responsible for the office, Zhang Chengyu will discuss specific measures with Governor Huang Muhan and Finance Director Song Ziliang after arriving in Guangdong and then return to Beijing. After the Central Government approves the measures, it will be changed.</p>

We have followed the provisions of Article 5 of the Opium Smoker Registration Measures and Article 9 of the General Anti-Drug Reporting Measures and requested the Commissioner to extend the work for one month, which has been approved from May 1 to the end of August, and to complete all opium smoker registration and anti-drug reporting matters within the deadline in accordance with the regulations and repeated orders and report them on file. In addition to separate letters, we hereby send a letter to your bureau for verification."

<p>Australian Aviator Keith Chisholm Denied Passage Through Soviet Russia</p>
<p>Australian aviator Keith Chisholm recently departed from Sydney, Australia, flew through the Dutch East Indies and arrived in China. He hoped to reach Europe via the Soviet Union. After arriving in Shanghai last week, he requested the Soviet Consul General in Shanghai to ask the Moscow government to allow him to fly over its airspace. Moscow has now sent a telegram refusing his request, but did not explain the reason. Since Chisholm cannot reach Europe according to his predetermined route, he will probably take the established air route to England via India and the Near East. However, Chisholm had previously explored this route, so he was quite disappointed that he could not take the northern new route. According to Chisholm, if the weather is clear, he may fly to North China on Wednesday morning and plans to make short stops in Xindu and the old capital. If he can enter Manchuria, he plans to continue north for a trip. After arriving in the old capital, he plans to inquire whether he can fly to western China, as he may enter Europe via Xinjiang. Otherwise, he will have to return to Shanghai and proceed via India.</p>

<p>British Labor Travel Association Male and Female Representatives Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The mainland newspaper reports that the British Labor Travel Association, whose purpose is to eliminate international discrimination, had twenty male and female representatives of the association arrive in Shanghai on the President Wilson on Sunday. The director is Grollm, a senior member of the London press. The purpose of this trip is to travel around the world. They departed from London on June 1 and arrived in the United States. They then boarded the President Wilson in San Francisco and arrived in Shanghai. They are scheduled to return to England on September 25. The Labor Travel Association was formed at the International Labor Conference in Geneva after the end of the European War. Grollm was one of the British representatives who participated in the association. He firmly believes that the closer the contact between people in the labor circles of various countries, the more it can eliminate wars and international misunderstandings. Therefore, after returning to his country at that time, he held this idea and established the Labor Travel Association. In the first year, a total of 700 people traveled to Europe. Last year, no less than 20,000 people in the British labor circles traveled to Europe organized by the association. The association also receives labor travelers from other countries to England. The group stayed in Shanghai for thirty-six hours and then took the original ship to South China.</p>

<p>The Real Estate Industry Cables the Ministry of Finance to Save the Right of Real Estate Sub-Mortgage, Which Is Greatly Related to the Entire Financial System. The Banking and Money Industries Are All Paying Great Attention to It.</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, in order to save the real estate industry, with the support of the Banking and Money Industries Association, has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to forward a request to the judiciary for an explanation of "if real estate A is mortgaged to B, and B then mortgages it to C, and B has gone bankrupt, then the real estate held by C is only an ordinary claim under the new law and cannot obtain a preferential claim" in order to save the situation. The original telegram will be released after Shen Tianxin, chairman of the association, returns to Shanghai from Wuhu. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from the banking and money industries yesterday that members of the banking and money industries consider the sub-mortgage of real estate to be a very common event. Since the First Special Zone Court cited the new law in the case of Chengyu Money Shop suing Dingzhen Money Shop, the real estate industry and the banking and money industries have been panicked because it is greatly related to the entire financial system. For example, banks and money shops have received a large number of sub-mortgaged real estate. If they cannot obtain priority rights and are regarded as ordinary claims, the risk is too great. At the same time, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank receive loan collateral from various banks and money shops, with real estate accounting for a large proportion. These real estate are all sub-mortgaged. Therefore, they hope that the judicial organs will remedy the situation.</p>

<p>Minister to Sweden and Norway Wang Jingqi Awaits Export. Secretary Shao Ting and Others Go to Sweden First.</p>
<p>Wang Jingqi, the newly appointed Chinese Minister to Sweden and Norway, arrived in Shanghai by train at 10:50 the night before last after paying respects to Foreign Minister Zhang in Beijing and asking for instructions. The local International Issues Research Association, etc., has scheduled a banquet to see him off at the Bank Association at 5:00 p.m. on the 14th. Wang received a reporter from the New Voice News Agency at his residence yesterday morning. According to his talk, he has now confirmed that he will take the German liner Naisna on the 18th to take office. His wife and eldest daughter will accompany him. He has already obtained the credentials and will not go to Beijing before his departure. After arriving in Sweden, he plans to immediately engage in the promotion of Sino-Swedish and Sino-Norwegian business, because the development of business relations is the main factor in strengthening diplomatic relations. He has previously visited Chinese business circles in Shanghai and met with leaders of Swedish and Norwegian overseas Chinese businessmen to make contacts and seek to balance the exports and imports of the two countries. However, he has not yet obtained concrete measures. In the past, the import of goods from Sweden and Norway to China exceeded the export of goods from China to those two countries. This is probably a common phenomenon of China's import surplus. Speaking of revising the Sino-Swedish and Sino-Norwegian treaties, there is now this proposal, which will be promoted in the future, Wang's eldest daughter, Ms. Zhangbao, is a doctor of political science from the University of Beijing. She will accompany her father abroad this time to continue her studies.</p>

<p>Forty-Nine Factories Hosted a Banquet for Pan Last Night. Hu Xiyuan and Others Were the Presidium. Pan Expressed His Gratitude in His Reply.</p>
<p>The forty-nine factories, including Meyer and Yapu, hosted a banquet for Pan Gongzhan, who is also the acting Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, last night. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>The forty-nine factories, including Meyer, etc., because after the death of Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, the municipal government appointed Pan Gongzhan as acting director. Because Pan has spared no effort in seeking welfare for industry and commerce when he served as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau in the past, they are deeply happy to have him in this position again. Therefore, they initiated a banquet, which was held at the Bank Club at 7:00 last night. The China First Knitting Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Forest Rattan and Willow Ware Factory, China Iron Factory, Chichang New Hide Glue Factory, Guan Leming Fountain Pen Factory, Yuanchang Leather Goods Factory, and Jiuxin Leather Goods Factory participated at the last minute, totaling forty-nine factories.</p>
<p>Guest and Host Names</p>
<p>In addition to Pan Gongzhan, those present included Pan Yangyao, Zhuang Zhongwen, Sun Daosheng, Wang Jiean, Yang Yucheng, Hua Runquan, Chen Yiting, and representatives from various factories Liu Hongsheng, Wu Yunqiao, Fang Yexian, Lao Jingxiu, Guo Shun, Jing Yidou, Zhu Zhenhan, Xu Jianruo, Hu Xiyuan, Fang Jiange, Gan Tinghui, Ji Jiannan, Dong Boying, Chen Bifei, Hu Guigeng, Li Xinpu, Cheng Nianpeng, Cai Shengbai, Ye Youcai, Yu Zhongxian, Yue Fucheng, Ren Shigang, Xiang Kangyuan, Shao Daren, Yang Weiyin, Dai Gengxin, Xian Guansheng, Zhu Gengtao, Xu Xiaochu, Zhang Huikang, etc., totaling more than seventy people. Hu Xiyuan, Wu Yunqiao, and Cai Shengbai were the presidium.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>During the banquet, Chairman Hu Xiyuan reported that he was very honored that everyone was present today. The people's relationship with the government is like that of children with their parents, so the government is in a position to protect the people. The country must first have excellent politics, and excellent politics must be promoted by virtuous officials. As far as Shanghai is concerned, the Social Affairs Bureau is the closest to the industrial and commercial circles. Director Pan, from the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce to the Social Affairs Bureau, coordinates labor and capital and encourages production internally, and expands publicity and uses domestic goods externally. Therefore, the people of Shanghai are deeply happy to have Director Pan in the Social Affairs Bureau again. The industrial and commercial circles hope that Director Pan will promote the welfare of industry and commerce in this city with the latest methods and the latest political guidelines in the future. On behalf of the forty-nine factories, I wish Director Pan and all of you gentlemen good health, etc.</p>
<p>Pan's Reply</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan replied, "Dear hosts, dear guests, I am very honored and grateful to receive this grand banquet from forty-nine large factories today. Before the January 28th Incident, I served as the Director of the Bureau of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce and the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau. At that time, the municipal government was newly established. Everyone knows the extreme changes in the national social and economic situation during the four years from the 16th to the 20th year of the Republic of China. Labor-capital disputes occurred constantly. I deeply felt my weakness, so I did not achieve anything in office and failed to make progress in the national industry, which I am ashamed of. Especially in these few years, the instability of the social economy has made the investment industry wary. Fortunately, the superior government knew the difficulty of the situation and the importance of the responsibility after the war, and allowed me to resign as Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, reducing my personal guilt. After this, the situation has become worse year by year, and the economic situation has deteriorated. The social productivity of the former Director Wu decreased due to the impact of the war, while labor-capital disputes were few due to the recession and the awareness of both parties. This can be said to be a sign of national prosperity in the midst of adversity. In these few years, the industry has also strived for quality improvement. This is purely the development of its own strength. Westerners say that our merchants have incredible strength. Without external oppression, they can naturally develop, which is beyond the reach of people in other countries. As for the slowness of progress, it is caused by the environment. Under this environment, it is enough to make foreigners look at us with new eyes, and it is enough to be proud and comforted. This time, Director Wu passed away, and Mayor Wu ordered me to temporarily act as director. Due to public and private friendship and obedience to the order, I could not refuse, and I took on the task again, knowing that I was not up to the task, so I deeply hoped that the authorities would immediately select virtuous and capable people to benefit industry and commerce. Being showered with praise makes me even more ashamed. China must save the country in a dangerous period. There is no other way but to unite the whole country. The unity of industries will lead to the entire industry, and then the government and the people will be united. The recovery of lost territories can be predicted. We should also (1) adopt a consistent approach in all industries, and the government should relieve the difficulties of the people in order to develop; (2) hope that leaders of all industries will recognize the trends of the times, promote factory management technology, strive for progress, and implement industry control with the concept of coexistence and co-prosperity to jointly maintain public norms. This is what my brother hopes from you all. Therefore, the saying that putting yourself in a deadly place will lead to survival is also the truth. Thank you for your love."</p>
<h3 id="e82">Nantong Water Police Passed Through Wusong Yesterday to Suppress Mutinying Soldiers of the Sijiao Security Corps <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Sijiao, Shengshan, and other islands outside the Sanjiashuikou of Wusong have always been gathering places for fishermen, isolated overseas and plagued by pirates. A security corps was specially formed for self-defense. Previously, it was organized by Water Police Captain Xu Wen (also known as Wen Dounan, nephew of the First Bureau Chief Wen Zhaoyi) and was under the jurisdiction of Chongming County. Since the corps was formed, peace has prevailed. The First Brigade was stationed on Shengshan, and the Second Detachment was stationed on Sijiao, with a total of more than eighty soldiers. Because Xu was from Anhui, most of the soldiers were also from Anhui. After Xu Wen's death a few years ago, the influence of the Anhui faction declined. Xu's detachment leader on the island (also from Anhui) was replaced last month due to an incident and was succeeded by a certain Shen, who was from Chongming. After taking office, Shen dismissed many soldiers from Anhui on various pretexts. Those who were dismissed were stranded on the island, suffering from hunger and cold. Moreover, the corps had been in arrears with pay for several months, so the dismissed soldiers colluded with soldiers from Anhui who were still in service. On the evening of the 4th of this month, they went to the corps headquarters, seized firearms, and shot dead one soldier who refused to join them. They then marched to the district office, took District Chief Ling Diaocheng, who was already asleep, into custody, and demanded the surrender of 480 yuan in foreign currency. They then opened fire several times and escorted Ling to the beach, where they detained him on a pre-arranged sailboat. Afterwards, they went to Detachment Leader Shen's residence to report to the captain that the soldiers had mutinied. Upon hearing the report, the captain was about to go to the corps to investigate when gunfire suddenly erupted behind him, and Captain Shen was killed. The mutineering soldiers held a meeting on the beach of the island the next morning (the 5th), summoned local people, and announced Shen's crimes, such as using private connections and excluding dissidents, stating that they had been unable to bear it and had shot him. They then claimed that the corps was heavily in arrears with pay and needed to be allocated funds by the local authorities, ordering the first and second security groups of fishermen to each contribute 500 yuan. The first security group managed to raise 500 yuan and paid it, but the second security group was unable to raise funds, resulting in the abduction of ten fishermen, who were held on the sailboat. Among those kidnapped was Hu Yuansen, the island's richest man, who independently contributed 2,000 yuan to release all those who had been kidnapped. At that time, the mutineering soldiers, having achieved their goal, wanted to flee elsewhere. However, District Chief Ling was still on the boat, which was very inconvenient. They intended to release him, but they were afraid that after his release, he would send a telegram to request troops from other places to suppress them, which would be unfavorable. Therefore, they dragged District Chief Ling to the beach, fired a shot, and killed him. With a loud roar, they all went aboard the boat, sailed into the sea, and fled to other places. After the incident, an investigation revealed that a total of three people had been shot dead, 2,980 yuan in cash had been extorted, and one hundred and several dozen firearms belonging to the security corps and local civilian self-defense forces had been seized. Upon hearing the news, the Chongming County government telegraphed Zhu Aizhou, the chief of the Third District of the Nantong Water Police, requesting him to send troops to pursue and arrest the mutineers. After receiving the telegram, Chief Zhu ordered Special Task Force Captain Xu Zhaonan and Li Jianleng, the captain of the Second Squad stationed in Tong, to lead troops to Sijiao to investigate and suppress the mutineers. The squad passed through Wusong yesterday and is heading to Sijiao to investigate.</p>

<p>Huang Linshu, former Director of Education of Guangdong Province and member of the Central Committee, representing Chen Jitang, came north to consult the Central Government on Chen's departure from the country. Since the 3rd of this month, he accompanied the newly appointed Minister of Audit, Lin Yungai, to Shanghai by air, visited President Chiang Kai-shek in his residence to complete his consultation. He then, on the afternoon of the previous day, accompanied by Secretary He Shaoqiong, took the China Aviation Corporation flight directly back to Shanghai, staying at the New Asia Hotel. After staying for a day, he boarded the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress Liner at around 10 pm last night and set sail at 3 am this morning, leaving Shanghai and returning to Hong Kong. Before his departure, Huang met with reporters from the New Voice Newspaper in the hotel yesterday afternoon. According to the interview, in addition to visiting President Chiang in his residence, he also had the opportunity to meet with President Sun (Ke), Tang Shaochuan, Wang Liangchou, and other gentlemen. The purpose of this trip was entirely to arrange for Mr. Bonan's departure from the country. Mr. Bonan has decided to leave the country in the near future, and the result of consulting with President Chiang was very satisfactory. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is handling his passport. All these matters have been reported to the Hong Kong newspapers by telegram. Initially, President Chiang telegraphed Mr. Bonan, hoping that he could come to Nanjing. Later, Mr. Bonan replied by telegram, proposing to go abroad for recuperation first, which was subsequently approved by President Chiang. Mr. Bonan plans to stay abroad for six months, first going to France and Switzerland, and then deciding on his next destination. His wife, Ms. Mo Xiuying, intends to stay in Hong Kong because her children need care. Lin Yizhong and Qu Fangpu have already gone to France.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Employees of China Credit Information Bureau Resumed Work Yesterday, Appointed Representatives to Continue Negotiations <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>After the staff of China Credit Information Bureau went on strike on the 7th due to dissatisfaction with the company's transfer of personnel, and after the good offices of Zhang Naiqi and Kong Shouheng, their opinions were close to each other. At 9:30 yesterday morning, Zhang Naiqi returned to the office to report to the staff the opinions of the directors. Then, the staff of the bureau held a meeting of members, and in consideration of the future of the business, the discussion resulted in a resumption of work first, sending letters of thanks to the mediators, the press, and the banks who had expressed their condolences, and appointing nine representatives to be responsible for continuing negotiations. It was unanimously passed at that time, and work was resumed at 12:30. It is heard that the board of directors has been understanding of the conditions proposed by the staff, and a little consultation can solve all the problems. The staff originally planned to extend the working hours by one hour per day to deal with backlogged cases, but most of them decided to intensify their work and no longer extend the time due to concurrent jobs.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Business Guidelines of Various Commercial Banks and Money Shops: Lending is Particularly Cautious <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to New Voice News, after the implementation of the new monetary system, although various industries have become active, they are still in decline due to the deep impact of the economic downturn. The business guidelines after this, in addition to stability, have to be changed. Although the commercial banks have had some surplus in the first half of the year, it is significantly less than in previous years. In addition, after the Central Trust Bureau and the China Bank of Communications established savings departments, deposits have increased sharply, so the savings deposits of commercial banks are inevitably affected. From the second half of the year, they have unanimously tightened up and are particularly cautious about various loans except for agriculture. Credit loans are reduced as much as possible. For example, the merger of the Jiangzhe and Zhonghui Banks, the closure of branches of the Zhongfu Silk Industry Bank, and the preparation for liquidation of the Guotai and Huaan Banks are all examples of this. In addition, various money shops are also particularly cautious about various loans due to the difficulty of business, especially credit loans, because the larger the loan, the greater the risk. For example, the suspension of listing of Hengyu and Hengji Exchange Money Shops and the suspension of new loans by Putai Deji Yuanzi Money Shop are all examples of this. However, the state banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, etc., have expanded their business due to the implementation of the currency system policy, such as regulating interbank finance and assisting agriculture, industry, and commerce, all of which have had significant effects in practice.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Buddhist Nun Disputes Temple Property <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Buddhist nun Xiujing, also known as Juezheng, and her fellow nuns Zijian and Yuandao are in court over the temple property of Wannan Temple in Tanzi Bay, resulting in a major dispute. Xiujing filed a lawsuit in the District Court against Zijian and Yuandao, alleging that they occupied the temple property, colluded to embezzle it, and publicly insulted her. She claimed that in 1922, she came to Wannan Temple in Beitanzi Bay to practice devoutly. At that time, the abbot of the temple was the late Master Zhikong. In the autumn of 1925, the Master ordered the plaintiff to take over and ordered Zijian to take over as the abbot of Wanfu Temple on Taiyang Temple Road in Zhabei. However, in July 1931, Zhong Lin, a guest master living in the temple, took advantage of the plaintiff's absence to leave the temple for some reason and was instigated by the second defendant, Yuandao, to seize the temple. In November 1932, the plaintiff filed a lawsuit, and Zhong Lin lost the case. At that time, the second defendant saw that the situation was becoming increasingly dangerous and asked the old abbot of Huashan to mediate, instructing Zhong Lin to pay the plaintiff 1,000 yuan to sever ties with Zhong Lin. Chang Shi, a member of Baohua Mountain, appointed Zhong Lin as the manager of Wannan Temple and established a settlement agreement. On the second day of the fifth lunar month of this year, Zhong Lin died of illness, and the plaintiff brought a license from Huashan to Shanghai to take over, but unexpectedly, the first defendant colluded with the second defendant to seize the temple and coerced and publicly insulted her in every possible way. She reported to the police and was ordered to file a lawsuit according to law. The defendants committed the crimes of Article 335, Paragraph 1, and Article 309, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. Zijian and Yuandao responded that the plaintiff was the first defendant's disciple, and the Wannan Temple and Wanfu Temple were both handed over to the first defendant by his master Zhikong. The second defendant was also the first defendant's eldest disciple, and the plaintiff was only an assistant to Wannan Temple. Therefore, the highest supervisory power still belonged to the first defendant, and he had fled since the Shanghai war and returned to Shanghai in 1932, when he was involved in a lawsuit with Zhong Lin and received 1,000 yuan, giving Wannan Temple to Zhong Lin and donating the deed to Baohua Mountain, which violated Buddhist laws and temple rules. Since he had already received the money and severed ties, he was not allowed to return to the temple. Wannan Temple was supervised and managed by the first defendant, and there were registration books from the Buddhist Association and the Public Security Bureau. He repeatedly intended to retake the temple, and the Buddhist Association and Wang Binyan and other gentlemen also opposed the plaintiff's takeover. As for the point of public insult, what evidence was there? He should be ordered to produce evidence, etc. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court for the hearing. The plaintiff withdrew the point of public insult in court. As for the embezzlement case, an order was given to summon the witnesses for further verification.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Two Special District Court Presidents Wang Simo Referred for Disciplinary Action: Investigation Reveals Illegal Protectionism and Neglect of Duty in the Xiamen Commercial Bank Liquidation Case <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Supervisory Yuan has announced that Wang Simo, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, and Judge Tu Shenjie engaged in illegal protectionism. The Supervisory Yuan has requested the Central Government Employees Disciplinary Committee to take disciplinary action. The relevant documents are recorded below:</p>
<p>Impeachment Document from the Supervisor</p>
<p>Supervisor Ding Chaowu's impeachment document states: Regarding the proposal for impeachment, the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, in document No. 1178, forwarded a memorandum from Supervisory Committee members Hu Boyue, Bai Rui, Tian Jiongjin, and Cheng Yunpeng, stating that Ye Qinghua, the legal representative of the Xiamen Commercial Bank's Shanghai branch, had filed a complaint alleging illegal actions and abuse of power by Wang Simo, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court. After review, it was recommended that the Secretariat issue a letter to the Jiangsu Supervisory District Supervisor's Office for investigation. The Executive Yuan approved this recommendation. Accordingly, the relevant documents, including original file No. Di Zi 868, are hereby forwarded for investigation and handling. Upon receipt, this office immediately dispatched Section Chief Huang Sen to conduct a thorough investigation. The following is a summary of the investigation report: (1) Regarding the collusion of Judge Tu Shenjie with associates: The plaintiff believes that the ruling of the Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Court on August 10, 1935, was procedurally flawed in two respects: A. Judge Tu Shenjie, based on the application of Yuanji Chen Yongyuan and others, immediately removed Sun Zhongyao as liquidator without requiring the petitioning shareholders to present their stock certificates or examining the reasons for the removal. However, according to Judge Tu's statement, after receiving the petition, the court summoned both parties for investigation. Sun Zhongyao was questioned about the shares listed in the petition of Yuanji and others. After reviewing the list, he acknowledged that there were no discrepancies. Therefore, following the usual practice of investigating evidence, since the facts were undisputed by the opposing party, there was no need to order the presentation of stock certificates. B. Although Tu Shenjie was aware that the petitioner had reached a settlement in the Shanghai First Special District Court, since the liquidator Sun Zhongyao had discovered that the company's assets were insufficient to cover its debts, he did not apply for bankruptcy as required by Article 23 of the Company Law, but instead sought a settlement with a small number of creditors. Therefore, even though it was a settlement during trial, the court could revoke it. (2) Regarding the overturning of the original ruling by the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the subsequent abuse of administrative power in detaining ships: The ruling of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court was decided at 9:00 AM on September 27, 1935, and received on October 3. However, the draft letter from Wang Simo, in his capacity as president, to the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, was prepared on September 26... The following day, it was sent out. The claim that Wang Simo knew about the overturning of the Second Special District Court's ruling by the Third Branch is inconsistent with the facts. Furthermore, after the petitioner presented the fact that the ruling had been overturned and requested the revocation of the previous order, the response stated that it should wait for the file to be returned by the higher court for further review. However, after the Second Special District Court received the overturning of the original ruling from the Third Branch of the High Court, but before making a new ruling, the request to revoke the detention order was still not processed, indicating intentional obstruction, which is legally inappropriate. A. Regarding knowingly sending a letter to the Commissioner of Customs after the ruling had been overturned: The draft letter from Wang Simo, in his capacity as president, to the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, was prepared on September 26. The ruling overturning the decision by the higher court was decided on the 27th of the same month and received on October 3. Before the ruling was final, the court president's request to detain the four ships was not illegal under the law. B. The Second Special District Court sent a letter to the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs based on the report of accountant Xu Yongzuo. However, the court never recognized the transfer of ownership of the Fu Dong, Fu Xi, and other ships, and continued to refer to them as belonging to the Fu Ning Commercial Shipping Company Limited. This difference in legal perspective should not be considered a disregard for the law or an intentional bias. C. Regarding acting beyond authority: The Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs is not the competent authority, and the court president's direct communication with them...</p>
<h3 id="e98">Dancer Fan Lingmei Leaves Datong and Joins Saint Anna: Accused of Breach of Contract, Datong Seeks Compensation of Over One Thousand Gold Pieces; Case Postponed for Reconciliation Possibility <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Fan Lingmei, a Suzhou woman residing in Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road, is 21 years old. She used to work as a prostitute in the Liangmu brothel in the Little Garden. Due to the economic downturn in recent years, dance halls have flourished, greatly impacting the brothels. She had no choice but to seek alternative employment, using her daytime leisure time to work as a dancer in dance halls such as Yangtze, while continuing to work at night as before. In October of last year, Fan Lingmei transferred to Datong Dance Hall. Due to her beauty and skillful dancing, she was welcomed by the dance patrons. Fan Lingmei then left her life of selling laughter and began working as a dance partner. She signed a contract with Datong Dance Hall for a term of six months. Although the contract expired in April of this year, Datong, considering Fan to be a star of the hall, was reluctant to let her leave and continued the contract for another six months. Unexpectedly, in June of this year, Fan Lingmei had a disagreement with Datong Dance Hall and resolutely left to dance at Saint Anna Dance Hall. Datong Dance Hall believes that Fan Lingmei should not have rashly transferred elsewhere before the contract expired. According to the contract, if one party violates the contract, they must compensate the other party for the losses. Therefore, they retained lawyers Xu Shihao and Rong Ji to file a petition with the First Special Court for mediation. The mediation failed, and a formal lawsuit was filed, requesting the court to order Fan Lingmei to compensate for the losses of over 1,600 yuan. The case was heard yesterday morning at 8:20 AM in the Civil Tenth Court by Judge Xu Fuji. Lawyer Rong Jilong appeared on behalf of the plaintiff to state the case. The defendant Fan Lingmei did not appear, and the lawyer appeared and stated that there was hope for reconciliation in this case, so he requested a postponement. The court ruled that the case would be postponed to the 19th for another hearing. ...in procedures. To speed up matters, but not follow procedures, is not a valid reason. D. Appointing accountant Xu Yongzuo to perform accounting duties before the ruling was final: The First Special District Court's separate appointment of a liquidator based on the application of an interested party is in compliance with the provisions of Article 205, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law. E. Denying the validity of the liquidator's actions before the court formally removed him from office: Article 58 of the Company Law stipulates the duties of the liquidator and clearly states that the liquidator has the power to represent the company in all actions in the performance of the aforementioned duties. Before the court formally removed him from office, his actions were valid. However, after taking office as liquidator, Sun Zhongyao did not immediately apply for bankruptcy in accordance with Articles 214 and 63, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law when he discovered that the company's assets were insufficient to cover its debts. Instead, he entered into a settlement agreement with a portion of the creditors. The court believed that the liquidator had indeed violated his duties as a liquidator and therefore removed him from office on August of 1935, and simultaneously appointed accountant Xu Yongzuo as liquidator, which is legally appropriate. However, this accountant did not publish the notice until November 18, causing considerable damage to the rights of the creditors, which is not appropriate. This office has reviewed that the court's removal of Sun Jiayao as liquidator, the separate appointment of Xu Yongzuo as liquidator, and the detention of ships in this case are not inappropriate under the law. However, this detention order was based on Xu Yongzuo's application. The court did not follow procedures and hurriedly sent a letter to the non-competent Jianghai Customs Commissioner, and after receiving the higher court's overturning of this ruling, but before making a new ruling, the applicant requested the revocation of the detention order, and the court responded by stating that it should wait for the file to be returned by the higher court, delaying it for almost four months. When this office's staff arrived for investigation, it had not yet been processed, and the liquidator appointed by the court had also delayed the publication of the notice by more than three months beyond the statutory period, causing considerable losses to the creditors. The circumstances clearly indicate illegal protectionism, and it is appropriate to file an impeachment according to law. It is requested that the current President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, Wang Simo, and the responsible judge, Xu Shenjie, be...</p>

<p>Huang Futian, a 27-year-old man from Haimen and employee of the Gaohe Leather Shoe Store at 191 Tongfu Road, was instructed by his brother Fuzhao to deliver two pairs of leather shoes and one pair of women's shoes to a customer surnamed Yuan in room 529 of the Yangtze Hotel around 10:00 PM on May 16. When he proceeded to the Oriental Hotel room 324 to deliver shoes for a customer surnamed Wang, he was lured by robbers to the kitchen area of 15 Ma'an Lane, Chongqing Road. They used kidnapping methods to tie him up, causing him to call for help and leading to his death. Subsequently, they sent a letter to his brother Fuzhao demanding a ransom of 30,000 yuan, hoping to get lucky. Detectives Zhang Desheng, Hua Youshan, and Zhang Yaoji of the Hongkou Police Department apprehended the suspects, Liu Zongyou and Hu Shili, both from Ningbo, in Ninghai County and at 82 Kunming Road, Shanghai, along with the murder weapon. They were handed over to the First Special District Court for detailed interrogation. After deliberation, the court announced the sentence yesterday morning. Judge Xiao Xieffen presided over the Third Criminal Court and declared the following main points: Liu Zongyou and Hu Shili committed joint kidnapping for ransom and intentionally killed the victim. Each is sentenced to death and deprived of political rights for life. The small knife is confiscated. In addition to disciplinary action, the above measure is to maintain the rule of law. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Committee Review Report</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee members Yu Hongqi, Wang Pingqi, and Liu E'qing stated in their review report: Regarding the review report, the Jiangsu Supervisor Ding Chaowu impeached Wang Simo, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, for illegal protectionism. The committee members jointly reviewed the case and concluded that in handling the debt dispute between the Xiamen Commercial Bank's Shanghai branch and the Shanghai Fu Ning Commercial Shipping Company Limited, the court, regarding the ships transferred to the creditor group, the Xiamen Commercial Bank's Shanghai branch, issued a detention order without following procedures and hurriedly sent a letter in the name of the President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court to the non-competent Jianghai Customs Commissioner. After receiving the higher court's overturning of this ruling, but before making a new ruling, the transferee requested the revocation of the detention order, but the court delayed the matter for more than three months, failing to process it. This constitutes illegal protectionism. Furthermore, the liquidator appointed by the court delayed the public announcement by three months beyond the statutory period, causing unwarranted damage to the creditors. This is also a neglect of duty. The impeached persons are indeed guilty of illegal protectionism and neglect of duty. It is requested that Wang Simo, President of the Shanghai Special District Court, and Tu Shenjie, the responsible judge, be referred for disciplinary action. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Supervisory Yuan Refers for Disciplinary Action</p>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan sent a document to the Central Government Employees Disciplinary Committee stating that according to the impeachment of Ding Chaowu, the Jiangsu Supervisory District Supervisor, regarding Wang Simo, the incumbent President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, and Judge Tu Shenjie, for illegal protectionism, the case was handed over to Supervisory Committee members Yu Hongqi, Wang Pingzheng, and Liu E'qing for review in accordance with the law. According to the report, the impeached persons are indeed guilty of illegal protectionism and neglect of duty. It is requested that Wang Simo, President of the Shanghai Special District Court, and Tu Shenjie, the responsible judge, be referred for disciplinary action. Accordingly, the relevant documents of this case are copied and forwarded to your committee for verification and handling.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 8:20, a Western police officer patrolling Suzhou Road in the Public Concession discovered a flat, wicker suitcase in front of the Shanghai Westerner Rowing Club. Initially, he thought it was luggage piled up by the club, so he didn't pay attention. However, after noticing that no one had claimed it for a long time, he became suspicious and went forward to inspect it. To his shock, the basket contained nothing else but the corpse of a woman around 20 years of age. The head was missing, and the limbs had been cut into four pieces, along with one piece of the body. It was a bloody and gruesome sight. Upon seeing this, the Western police officer immediately reported it to the police station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. They concluded that it was a case of murder and the body had been dumped there. The corpse was transferred to the coroner's office for examination. The identity of the deceased and the reason for her murder are still under close investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Singing Girl Wu Peilan Accuses Song Gengsheng: Affection Grows During Banquets, Cohabitation and Childbirth, Then Abandonment <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Wu Rongsheng, a 51-year-old man from Suzhou, resides at No. 1 Menpai, Sanxin Lane, Ailege Road, Beichujiaqiao, French Concession. He has a daughter named Peilan, who is 20 years old this year. She studied drama in her childhood and performed at the Qunfanghui in the Great World. Every day at dusk, she also sang at various restaurants and taverns. Because of her good looks and artistic skills, the family of father and daughter was still able to make a living. Two years ago, when Peilan was singing at the Quanxingkang Hotel north of Xianshi Company on Zhejiang Road, Song Gengsheng (38 years old this year) from Hubei, who lived at No. 9 Chongan Lane, Haifang Road, happened to be drinking with friends. He met Peilan and asked her to perform. During the entertainment, Wu and Peilan exchanged glances. After the banquet, they went to the Great Shanghai Hotel and lingered there. Since then, the two developed a relationship. Later, the two decided to meet every Saturday night. Until last year, Peilan had a child named Xiaomaotou. Since then, Song Gengsheng's traces of contact with Peilan have gradually become estranged. Now, Wu Rongsheng, Peilan's father, in his capacity as legal guardian, along with his daughter Peilan, retained a lawyer to file a special lawsuit in the criminal court of the Second Special Court, accusing Song Gengsheng of harming the family. The court accepted the lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu presided over the Second Criminal Court to summon them for questioning. First, the plaintiffs, father and daughter, described the course of the case, and then the lawyer hired by the defendant to defend him, Mr. Xu Xuzhang, arrived in court to await questioning and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. According to the defendant Song Gengsheng, what the plaintiff said was not true. He claimed that two years ago, when the defendant was socializing with friends at the Quanxingkang Hotel, a singer named Wu Shunbao, i.e., Peilan, came forward to solicit singing. He got to know her by soliciting songs. Later, the woman recommended herself and learned that in addition to singing, she also worked as a prostitute. The defendant was negligent for a while and had a physical relationship with her, but each time he paid a night fee of five or six yuan. Her father and mother both knew about it. Wu Shunbao is still in the singing industry and sings in the Qunfanghui in the Great World. Her parents regard her as a cash cow and monitor her closely, never leaving her side. Her whole family lives in Sanxin Lane, and everyone knows about it, and Li Jianxian can testify to this. As for cohabitation and childbirth with the defendant, it is all fictitious. It is appropriate to punish the counterclaim for false accusation, etc. After verifying the confessions in court, it was announced that the hearing would be postponed to another date.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Fujian Fellow Provincial Association Newsletter <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The solicitation of achievements by the Fujian Fellow Provincial Association has been reported in previous news. The team leaders, not afraid of the heat, have worked hard in various ways. The teams of Shen Shuyu, Ye Zhendong, Chi Huagu, Ma Deji, Zhu Lide, He Fusen, Huang Jianzhong, etc., have recently reported to the association one after another. It is planned to announce the results after the scores are compiled. There are already dozens of people who have joined as permanent basic members. Recently, Council President of the Ministry of Railways, Hui Rongpu, Consultant of the Fujian Provincial Government, Li Zeyi, and Director of the Postal Savings Bureau, Wu Xizhi, have also joined as permanent basic members. However, the association believes that some fellow provincials do not understand the rights and interests of basic members and their importance, and most only serve as ordinary members or supporting members. It is feared that the organization will still be difficult to improve. Therefore, the 5th Special Committee meeting yesterday decided to add Articles 8 and 9 to the outline of the articles of association to explain them. The articles are recorded as follows: (8) In addition to enjoying the general rights and interests of the association's members, basic members have the following special rights within one year: A. Have full attendance at the members' congress and the right to elect. B. When their occupation requires special introduction and publicity, they may request the association to handle it specially. C. When the association's undertakings are related to various members or fellow provincials, they may provide a corresponding guarantee. (9) In addition to permanently enjoying the various special rights in Article 8, permanent basic members have the following permanent special rights: A. Have complete eligibility to be elected (Note) For officers such as members of the Fund Management Committee, whose term of office is more than one year, only permanent basic members may be elected. B. When members need to be subsidized for weddings, funerals, or special events, the association may notify them. C. Other rights and interests that belong to the association's scope of duties and are not specified in the articles of association may also be enjoyed by special instructors, special sponsors, or special board members and special members in Shanghai. Furthermore, the Special Committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Song Yuanyuan, also reported and resolved several important cases: 1. Chairman Chen of the Fujian Provincial Government donated 2,000 yuan of national currency. According to letters from Directors Gao Dengting and Zheng Zhenwen, the donation was raised privately by Chen. It was immediately resolved to assign Committee Member Chi Hualong to go to Fujian to thank him and receive the funds. 2. The case of the Navy Aircraft Office workers petitioning for maintenance was replied by Director Zeng Yijing that it would still be maintained for one month and would try to find a way to arrange for them. 3. Regarding the occupation of Minqiao Villa by the security team, the Songhu Garrison Command replied that they had ordered them to find a site and move out as soon as possible to maintain good deeds. 4. The aid case for the trainees of the Aircraft Office who were dismissed was resolved by forwarding a letter to Minister Chen of the Navy. 5. The articles of association of the Fund Management Committee were drafted by three committee members, Zhuang Xun, Shen Xiaoguang, and Liu Qinlin. Zhuang Xun convened the meeting. 6. The reward method for the winning teams in the solicitation of achievements was stipulated: A. Teams with achievements of more than 200 yuan will be awarded a mirror frame each. B. Teams with achievements of more than 500 yuan will be awarded a mirror frame and declared and the names published in a newspaper, and a copper medal will be made and awarded to celebrate the achievement.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Pan Xulun and Others Initiate the Establishment of a United Insurance Adjusting Office <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>With the aim of ensuring insurance premiums are not wasted, prominent Shanghai accountants Pan Xulun, Yu Haifan, and others, in light of the increasing development of insurance services and the growing number of loss compensation cases, and due to the lack of research on insurance matters by Chinese citizens, which leads to frequent disputes, have established the United Insurance Adjusting Office. The aim is to seek fair and appropriate resolutions in the event of loss compensation disputes between insurance companies and policyholders. The following is a record of its origins: Regarding the establishment, our accountants have observed that domestic fire and marine insurance services are increasingly developing, and loss compensation cases are becoming more frequent. However, among Chinese individuals, there are few who specialize in notarization and serve insurance companies and policyholders. Therefore, we have gathered experts from various industries to establish the United Insurance Adjusting Office, which has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration to perform the duties of a notary public. We aim to thoroughly reform existing malpractices and maintain a fair and impartial attitude to seek a fair and appropriate resolution for both insurance companies and policyholders in the event of loss compensation. Since commencing practice, we have accumulated practical experience and deeply feel that Chinese citizens still lack sophisticated research into insurance matters. This is because they are unclear about insurance regulations, or neglect prior planning, or during the effective period of the contract, do not understand the conditions that must be observed, or after an accident, do not know the appropriate steps to take. As a result, they waste excessive premiums, increase unnecessary burdens, and when they suffer losses, they cannot obtain appropriate compensation, leading to severe and irreparable damage, which is a common occurrence. The pain of not being able to obtain adequate compensation after suffering a loss is well understood by those who have experienced an accident or are familiar with the situation. The waste of premiums at ordinary times, though limited in each instance, accumulates into a large sum over time. This kind of intangible loss should not be overlooked. The sole aim of insurance is originally to spend a small amount of premium in advance to prevent major disasters. Therefore, the payment of premiums should be based on the most economical principle, and the compensation after an accident should aim to make up for the entire loss. If both cannot be achieved, then the effectiveness of insurance is lost. However, this is not because the insurance system is not perfect, nor is it the original intention of insurance companies, but because policyholders do not seek professional insurance advice and fail to handle matters appropriately, leading to this outcome. Now, our accountants, with the original intention of serving society, seek to relieve all sectors from the above pain and waste, and have added the method of permanent insurance consultants to provide timely consultation for those who need insurance, entrusting them to plan so that premiums are not wasted, and in the future, in the event of an accident, they will not suffer significant losses even with insurance.</p>

<p>The Li She autumn calligraphy and painting exhibition on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store on Nanjing Road entered its fourth day yesterday. The number of visitors was even greater than before, including Shen Qiuyan, Lin Bosen, Li Wu, and others from the press, as well as Zai Yachen, Liu Kang, Rong Junli, Hu Bozhou, Zhou Zhiqin, and others from the art world, and over 500 Chinese and foreign dignitaries from the art circles of England, Japan, France, Russia, Germany, and Italy, among whom the Japanese were particularly numerous. During the visit, they quickly recorded details of each exhibit and inquired about the age and origin of the artists, especially noting Hu Zao's tiger paintings and Zhang Shuqi's flower and bird paintings. They also asked the Li She for permission to photograph them. After photographing Hu and Zhang's works, they also photographed four works by Zhang Yuguang and Lin Jieru before leaving at six o'clock. On that day, thirty paintings by Zhang Shuqi, Yuan Songnian, Qian Huafu, and others were sold. The association will replace the exhibits of Hu Zao and others tomorrow for the appreciation of all circles.

<h3 id="e115">Former President of the District Court, Shen Xiqing, Passes Away <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Shen Xiqing, former president of the Shanghai District Court, served in the legal profession for many years. After graduating from Waseda University in Japan at the end of the Qing Dynasty, he returned to China and served as a teacher at various law schools in Zhejiang. After the founding of the Republic, he successively served as a judge of the Zhejiang Provincial Court, a presiding judge of the higher courts of Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangsu, and the president of the Yongjia, Wuxian, and Shanghai district courts, as well as the president of the Shanghai District Court and the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee. He was upright, enforced the law impartially, and eliminated accumulated abuses, earning a reputation wherever he went. For example, in Yongjia, he rebuilt the court building; in Changhu, he built staff dormitories; and in Changhu Court, he rebuilt the detention center, either by using surplus funds or by diligently managing with minimal funds, working hard and tirelessly to achieve success. In the sixteenth year, he also assisted in the recovery of the Mixed Court and made significant contributions. After resigning last summer, he suffered from hemorrhoids that were not healed after surgery, and then contracted a lung disease. He died in his hometown of Shaoxing on June 28. He served in the legal profession for nearly 30 years, maintaining integrity and living a simple life. After his death, he was impoverished, and those who heard of it felt sorry for him. His wife and daughters are now burying him in Baiyutan in his hometown, and many of his friends are attending the funeral. Alas, this honest official will forever rest in a mound of yellow earth among the mountains and waters of Kuaiji.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Continued Trial of the Tongyi Company Lawsuit - Another Creditor Joins the Lawsuit - 700,000 in Government Bonds Sold for 520,000 - Huang Suchu and Seven Others Absent, Trial Concluded Yesterday <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Following the bankruptcy of the Tongyi Trust Company, its general manager Huang Suchu and all directors, supervisors, and assistant managers were successively sued for criminal self-accusation of fraud and embezzlement by Li Songtao and others who had deposited government bonds. The First Special District Court has investigated the circumstances, as reported previously. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing continued the investigation. The defendants Huang Suchu, Liu Fangyuan, Sun Xinzhong, Liu Renzan, Xiong Mulian, Wu Jing, and Chen Gongqia remained absent. Jiang Liuzhi was ill in the hospital, and Zhou Shouliang was dispatched to Guangdong by order of the Ministry of Finance, so he was also unable to attend in person.</p>
<p>The remaining Xu Jiyin, Guo Chushang, Chuan Zhuyin, Jin Weiqin, Deng Dongming, and Zhou Longzhan all attended the court with their defense lawyers. Liu Zikang, who was in custody, was also brought to the court. In addition to the original plaintiffs, Chen Yanying was newly added as a plaintiff. Chen stated the facts of the lawsuit, saying that 700,000 in 96 government bonds were deposited with the company. Later, due to a need for funds, she used the bonds to borrow 30,000 yuan. Subsequently, Jin Weiqin informed her that a portion of the bonds had been sold by the company. Now, after investigation by her lawyer, it has been found that 570,000 was sold.</p>
<p>Only 130,000 remains, etc. When questioned, Jin Weiqin stated that Chen pledged the deposited funds, and after Chen and Sun Xinzhong contacted each other, she learned that the company had sold a portion of them, so she notified Chen. She did not initially know how much was sold, etc. Xu Jiyin and Guo Yuchu both stated that they were not executive directors, so they were not clear about the company's business situation, and they did not know that the company's capital had been亏蚀 to the point of declaring bankruptcy, so it was difficult to make any claims, etc. Chuan Zhuyin also stated that he</p>
<p>was not originally a shareholder.</p>
<p>Only because he and Huang Suchu were from the same hometown, Huang came to invite him to be a supervisor the year before last winter, and sent him 1,000 yuan in stock, valued at 600 yuan. But although he served as a supervisor, he never attended meetings. He was not aware of the disposal of government bonds, etc. The court then ruled that the proceedings against Huang Suchu and the other seven defendants who had avoided court should be suspended, and the remaining persons should immediately begin their defense. Subsequently, the lawyers for the plaintiffs, Zhang Yifan, Le Junwei, Shi Ying, and others, jointly stated that the defendants had violated the criminal law by committing</p>
<p>fraud and embezzlement</p>
<p>and the reasons for violating the provisions of the Company Law, requesting that the responsible defendants be punished according to the law and demanding that the related civil suits be adjudicated together. Judge Zhong ruled that the related civil suits of the individual plaintiffs should be resolved together, and instructed the lawyers for the defendants to defend the defendants. First, lawyer Xu Shihao defended the Xu Ji and Zhou Shouliang's not being responsible for this case. The reasons are as follows: Xu and Zhou have been prosecuted in several cases because the company ceased operations. However, regarding criminal cases, one case has already ruled Xu and Zhou innocent. Regarding civil cases, a case was opened this morning, and the plaintiff in that case voluntarily withdrew the charges against Xu, Zhou, and other defendants. As for the charges of fraud and embezzlement brought by the plaintiffs in this case, they are all speculations about Xu and Zhou. After all, there is no evidence to prove whether Xu and Zhou committed fraud or privately mortgaged government bonds. How can one be placed in the law based on speculative evidence? Xu and Zhou have also repeatedly admitted that they did not know the capital</p>
<p>had already been depleted and the assets were insufficient to repay the debts. Of course, it was impossible to propose convening a meeting to declare bankruptcy. Moreover, the company's articles of association stipulate that the executive directors are responsible for executive affairs. Xu and Zhou are not executive directors. Of course, they do not know the company's situation and should be declared innocent and the related civil suit dismissed. It was decided that Guo Yuchang's lawyer would defend. Guo's position is equal to that of Xu and Zhou, so the reasons for the defense are also the same. Lawyer Shan Zaiyou defended Jiang Liuzhi, saying that Jiang</p>
<p>was previously a supervisor</p>
<p>but had not participated in company affairs for six or seven years and was not responsible for criminal liability. The Company Law cited by the plaintiffs mostly applies to directors and has nothing to do with supervisors. The lawyer for Chuan Zhuyin also said that although Chuan was a supervisor, he had never inquired about company affairs. In addition, the defense lawyers for Jin Weiqin, Deng Dongming, Zhou Longzhan, and Liu Zikang all defended their clients, saying that they were either unaware of the situation or served as general managers. After the defense, Judge Zhong ruled that the debate was concluded and the sentence would be pronounced on the afternoon of the 18th. Jin Weiqin and Zhou Longzhan each paid a bail of 2,000 yuan, and Liu Zikang was remanded in custody. After the ruling, the court adjourned at five o'clock.</p>

They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Mr. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, explained the case and stated that the defendant Wang Ada had previously committed the same crime and was sentenced and sent to the hospital for rehabilitation. Detective Guo then reported the process of uncovering the den and presented the evidence. Judge Xiao Xiecai questioned each defendant and sentenced Wu Arong and Liu Xiangyun to two years of imprisonment each, Sheng Guanzhen to one year and six months, and Wang Ada (who should have been shot) to twelve years, reduced, and ordered to undergo compulsory detoxification at the hospital for a period of no more than one month before serving the sentence.

<p>Mr. Zhang Xiesheng, a service member of the Chinese Boy Scouts, usually likes to do adventurous undertakings, and for the purpose of investigating local customs and conditions, he set off alone from Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival two years ago to perform the feat of a long-distance walking tour of the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong and Anhui. At that time, he walked along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to Nanjing, crossed the Yangtze River, then along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to Tianjin, and then through the Beijing-Ningbo Railway to Beiping, turned south, passed through Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and other places via the Pinghan Railway, and arrived at Hankou. Currently, in the lower sentence of last month, he boarded Mount Lushan from Jiujiang. By this time, the journey had exceeded ten thousand miles, and most of his entire plan had been completed. When he arrived at Mount Lushan, it happened that Chairman Chiang was also stationed at Mount Lushan. Admiring his youthful perseverance, he immediately ordered his adjutant to summon him, and he inquired about the journey in great detail, and exited after ten minutes. Before leaving, the chairman personally inscribed the four characters "Ten Thousand Miles Long March" to encourage him. Currently, Mr. Zhang left the mountain on the 3rd of this month to Anqing, and will soon be able to end the entire journey. When he returns to Shanghai, he will organize the results of his investigation of the local customs and customs along the way for publication for reference by national boy scouts.

<h3 id="e120">Gangsters Band Together to Commit Violence - Taking the Opportunity to Rob Money <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Fan Fugen, a local, works in a military uniform factory and lives at 42 Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai. At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, Fugen and his wife, Ms. Cheng, went to Zhongxinjing to see a doctor and returned home. They took the opportunity to visit Wang Adi, the young sister of a small sister living at 7 Gongjiazhai on South Hongqiao Road. Suddenly, gangsters Zhang Xiaodi (father's name Housheng) and Zhang Agui, who lived nearby, entered and strongly accused Fugen of suspected of abducting women and intended to extort money. So they surrounded Fugen and beat him violently, causing him to bleed profusely, injured and fell to the ground. The gangsters took the opportunity to rob 15 yuan and 60 cents in legal tender and a prescription. Later, Wang Adi used a car to send Fugen home for medical treatment and reported to the Chengjiaqiao Police Station, requesting detention. Officer Wang sent police to arrest Zhang Xiaodi and Zhang Agui, and while they were being questioned, Ding Acui, Zhang Xiaodi's mistress, dared to lead many people to wait outside the police station. When Fugen and his wife came out, they beat them to the ground again. Fortunately, the sentry police caught Ding Acui and sent her to the Pusong Police Station together. Yesterday, the director of the station questioned them in detail and learned that these people were engaged in extortion in the Hongqiao Road area. Countless nearby villagers have been victimized. Now they are taking the opportunity to rob, which is extremely illegal. In addition to the plaintiff Fan Fugen's wife, Fan Cheng, being released on bail due to illness, the remaining four plaintiffs and defendants, men and women, were all sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for investigation according to law.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Inheritance Lawsuit After the Death of Painter Cheng Yaosheng <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Cheng Yaosheng, a famous calligrapher from Anhui, used to work as a pawnshop officer in Changzhou, where he lived with Li Xiujin, a woman from Changzhou. Later, Cheng Yaosheng became famous for his calligraphy and painting skills, and then came to Shanghai together to make a living by painting, earning a good income. Later, Cheng had an affair with a nanny from Wuxi, and the relationship with Li Xiujin broke down. The Wuxi nanny instigated abuse, and Li, unable to bear the suffering, went to a nunnery to practice. Because her private savings were used up, Cheng ignored her, so Li filed a lawsuit against Cheng in the First Special Court. After mediation, a lawyer proved that Cheng gave Li 1,500 yuan for temporary living expenses. Soon after, Cheng Yaosheng died of illness, and all of his assets of more than 100,000 yuan were divided up by Cheng's adopted son, Cheng Yinsheng, and Cheng Rongsheng, the son brought by the nanny, who ignored Li Xiujin. Yinsheng became the manager of a money shop because of this relationship, while Rongsheng became a wealthy gentleman in the countryside. Recently, Cheng Li Xiujin's lawyer filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Cheng Yinsheng and Rongsheng of abandoning and encroaching on the inheritance. The case has been tried several times, but it has not ended because the second defendant, Cheng Rongsheng, is ill and has not arrived. Yesterday, Wang Gangxu, the chief of the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, summoned the two defendants and Gao Danhua and Dong Banggan, the lawyers who previously proved the mediation, to inquire about the process of Cheng Yaosheng paying the plaintiff 1,500 yuan. The two defendants still did not recognize the plaintiff's status to analyze the inheritance of her deceased father and denied abandonment. After the lawyers on both sides debated, the court announced the end of the hearing and set the date for sentencing at 8:00 AM on the 18th.</p>

<p>At 10:30 last night, a man in his thirties was riding a bicycle when he passed the intersection of Yiyuan Road and Yidingpan Road. Suddenly, a black-plated car of a certain number drove over at high speed. The man was unable to avoid it and was knocked to the ground, suffering extremely serious head injuries. At that time, he was unconscious. Later, a Chinese police officer caught a glimpse of it and reported it to the Fire Brigade, which sent an ambulance to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Because he could not speak when he arrived at the hospital, his name could not be known. Later, a business card was found next to him, which said Lu Xinxiang.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, Xu Shunsen Hardware Store at 29 Gansi Dong Road in the French Concession sent two apprentices, Lin Gen (14 years old) from Pudong and Xu Xiaomao (16 years old), to repair the lead rainwater pipes on the roof of the building at 141 Caishi Street. At 8:30, they were working on the edge of the eaves when they fell and suffered injuries to their brains and internal organs, falling into a coma. They were sent to Guangci Hospital, but they died before receiving treatment. After receiving the report, the French police station sent detectives to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall to examine the bodies. Yesterday, the Second Special Court was reported, and Prosecutor Wang Ren arrived at the hall to clarify the situation. The families of the two bodies were all in the countryside and could not arrive in time. Wu's body was collected by his maternal uncle Yao Ashun, and Lin Gen was collected by his shop owner Xu Musheng after making a bond.</p>

<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at 505 Henan Road, is a charitable organization registered with the Ministry of Interior. It usually devotes itself to construction to prevent natural disasters. In the event of a disaster, it will consider the situation and hold emergency relief work to seek relief. Over the past fifteen years, the water conservancy, transportation and cooperative undertakings it has handled have spread throughout the country, and the results have been very good. Last summer, the Yangtze River and Yellow River successively flooded, and disasters spread to several provinces. The association submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior to carry out Jianghe flood relief work, and strived to provide relief. All the work carried out was in accordance with the principles of being practical and swift, and efforts were made to carry it out. The survivors have been rescued and a large number of people have been saved. Recently, because the disaster situation in various places has gradually eased, and the urgent and work relief efforts have been completed one after another, there is no need to continue raising donations for the Jianghe flood disaster, and the collection of donations was terminated at the end of last month. In the future, it is planned to resume normal work and engage in construction. The donations collected this month will be used for construction projects.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from Qiantaixiang Hardware Store, proposing to add a small red chop to the revenue stamps purchased and stored before they are used, and requested the Ministry of Finance to verify and instruct them. Now, the Ministry of Finance has approved and opened the mill's proxy telegram, and has learned that the revenue stamp is a national tax collection certificate. According to the provisions of Article 12 of the Stamp Duty Law, stamping or drawing a pledge at the riding seam between the tax ticket and the original paper surface is a cancellation symbol. If there are other stamps on the tax ticket, which are mixed with the cancellation symbol, and the distinction is not clear, it is easy to involve suspicion of reuse. Therefore, merchants should not affix another stamp to cause disputes, except for stamping the riding seam for cancellation after affixing the stamp. As for the special tax tickets for customs and other special purposes, all are stamped by the Ministry, and when merchants stamp them for cancellation, which is the cancellation stamp and which is the special stamp is obvious and different from the above situation. It is not convenient to cite it as an example. You should immediately transfer the instructions for notification in this batch.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Statement That the Deadline for Licenses for the Transportation and Sale of Local Goods Is Approaching Is Not Accurate <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency said that the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Private Inspection Committee announced that the newspaper reported yesterday that the deadline for licenses for the transportation and sale of local goods is approaching soon. The fact is not accurate. Although the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that manufacturers of foreign goods who are engaged in inspection should register with the customs and obtain a license, with a limit of 20 days from the date of local promulgation, this is a deadline in terms of procedure. In fact, those who register with the customs and obtain a license recently, the customs is still continuing to process. As for the method of obtaining licenses for the transportation and sale of local goods, although the procedures are roughly the same as those for obtaining licenses for the transportation and sale of foreign goods, according to the customs announcement on July 27, there is no deadline.</p>

Fellow villagers are wrongly regarded as leaders, and they should set an example by donating first, and then discuss fundraising methods. On the spot, the attending committee members voluntarily donated or determined the amount to be raised on their behalf, and then discussed other important cases.</p>

<p>To the Editor: This correspondent notes that various newspapers in Shanghai have reprinted a news item from Dagongbao entitled "Ministry of Finance Thoroughly Clears Private Goods and Establishes Shanghai Intelligence Office," which is largely inconsistent with the facts. While this office has been established, it is entirely of a trial nature and has only been approved by Minister Kong upon presentation by Li Weiqing personally to trial intelligence matters regarding investigating smuggling, bearing exclusive responsibility for intelligence, without executing tasks. There is no concrete organization internally. The thirty individuals comprising the intelligence unit are divided into three teams, and they notify anti-smuggling agencies and relevant military police based on what they have investigated. The communication office set up on Father Lao Road in the French Concession is also not an officially established agency, and that communication office has been moved to the Chinese area. The correspondent hereby informs and requests that you verify and correct this matter. Sincerely, Li Weiqing, August 11.</p>

<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Once, while having dinner with some friends, one of them asked, "Why do waiters in restaurants always seem to prefer offering foreign beer and foreign soda to guests? What's the reason for this?" The answers at the time varied: (1) They're greedy for small profits. (2) They lack knowledge and don't understand the principles of patriotism. (3) They're following the owner's orders and willingly allowing rights to flow out. Such waiters, lacking a national perspective, are certainly unforgivable. However, the lack of enforcement power in society and the lack of a sense of right and wrong are also major reasons. I remember Mr. Chu Fucheng once loudly advocating at a meeting that there should be a cleansing movement in the food and beverage industry. What to cleanse? It's not selling foreign beer, not drinking foreign soda, from the errand boy to the waiter, to the shop assistant, manager, shareholder, and customer, everyone must have this mindset, everyone must hold this intention, and then the national products business will have hope for development.</p>
<p>Therefore, Hu Jun Xiyuan suggests that instead of passively punishing, it's better to actively encourage. Starting today, a legitimate national products organization should investigate whether a certain restaurant uses national product beer, soda, and all other consumables. Then, based on the investigator's accurate report, if it can be said that the restaurant absolutely does not use any foreign beverages, the national products organization or institution should give it a prominent plaque saying "Practicing National Product Beverages" or display the words "Completely National Products" so that customers can know at a glance. Doing this would be very effective. Otherwise, advising people or lecturing waiters will always be piecemeal and not very effective.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Smuggling Inspection and Promoting National Products <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Smuggling inspection and promoting national products are originally the only ways to save the national economy and revive industry and commerce. Therefore, these two aspects cannot be separated when discussing them. We know that smuggling inspection is a necessary task to protect domestic products, and expanding and strengthening the national product movement is the fundamental condition to eliminate smuggling.</p>
<p>Recently, regarding the future of smuggling inspection and promoting national products, we heard good news, which is that at the recent joint conference of chambers of commerce from various provinces and cities in Shanghai, they passed a proposal to organize the "General Association of Smuggling Inspection of Chambers of Commerce in Various Regions of the Republic of China." The establishment of this large-scale, voluntary smuggling inspection organization by the people comes at a time when the smuggling problem remains serious, especially when domestic industries suffer greatly and their situation becomes increasingly difficult. Its significance is very great, and its mission is even more important. We sincerely hope that it can have great success in suppressing smuggling and strictly preventing profiteers, and that it will make considerable efforts to develop domestic products and promote industry, fulfilling its duty to revive industry and commerce and promote the national economy.</p>
<p>We know that the thorough solution of the smuggling problem requires the voluntary rise of all the people of the country, which is very important. Because only when the general public understands that smuggled goods must not be bought or sold, regarding them as floodwaters and fierce beasts, then, even if smuggled goods can seep into all parts of the Chinese interior like mercury, they will never have the chance to change their appearance and be sold publicly again after being strictly prevented and mutually supervised by various chambers of commerce and other public organizations. Being unable to promote and sell them is the best way to fundamentally eliminate the smuggling problem. Finally, I would also like to earnestly hope that in the future, we must not only strive to investigate smuggling but also strive to promote the sales of national products, so that the development of national industries and smuggling inspection can be integrated into one, opening a bright path for the future national economic construction, and only by working hard in this way can we better satisfy the ardent expectations of the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e138">National Economic Construction Movement and Promoting National Products <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yangyao</p>
<p>Promoting national products is a matter of life and death for China today, and the urgency is very different from what it was one or two decades ago. Just ask, the customs revenue is over tens of millions of yuan annually, and tax evasion and smuggling are also over one or two tens of millions of yuan. The outflow of huge amounts of silver every year is even more uncompensated. How much wealth do the people have? How can they not go bankrupt? If this continues without a solution, the national economy will be completely beyond repair in two or five years for a shorter period, or ten years for a longer period. Where would there be a place for national products? Therefore, promoting national products and using national products today is a work of saving the national economy, a work of seeking survival and saving life. It can be said to be the most important work of the country today. If one does not think that promoting national products is important, it is better to seek oneself than to seek others, it is better to save oneself than to beg for help, especially needing everyone to have a sense of public spirit, to be able to be self-aware, and to eliminate the ideas of the small self, to extinguish the thoughts of selfishness, and to unanimously dedicate their abilities and contribute to the national economy, to make strict protection, to avoid the attack of foreign goods. In my personal opinion, Chinese people today should have four ways of working hard for national products from the standpoint of the national economy.</p>
<p>(1) Unite the Strength of the Same Industry. The most important work for the survival of national product industries is the unity of the same industry. Therefore, uniting the strength of the same industry is essential for the self-rescue of the national products sector. Since ancient times, the biggest fatal wound in the failure of national products has not been external enemies but internal enemies, not foreign merchants but the same industry. Obviously, an industry with great promise, after many difficult creations or hard inventions, before long everyone imitates and emulates, without asking whether the supply and demand are corresponding, whether the needs are increasing, confused by the great profits, competing in groups, producing crudely and poorly, and lowering prices with each other. As a result, they feel the same difficulties and perish together, ultimately causing a certain industry to be completely wiped out, giving foreign goods a chance to sell well. Thinking about it afterward, it is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, today's cooperation between the same industry is a way for each individual to save themselves. Each person should join the same industry association, respect the regulations and resolutions of the same industry association, and go further to seek cooperation in the purchase of raw materials, cooperation in the sale of products, and in all aspects of production, the same industry should give full play to their strengths everywhere, for the development of the division of labor, in order to achieve effective cooperation, and the life of national products may be maintained or not abolished.</p>
<p>(2) Pay Attention to Improving Products. Our national products have indeed made progress compared to the past, but there are still many that are not satisfactory. Are the machinery and equipment excellent? Is the factory management proper? Is the personnel aspect comprehensive? Have all products reached the goal of standardization? Are the goods sold overseas welcomed by people? Those engaged in the national products business should always have a spirit of innovation, constantly research, and constantly improve, so that the quality of products can surpass others, and the future of national products will naturally feel bright.</p>
<p>(3) Find Ways to Reduce Costs. If we think that today the self-rescue of the national products sector means that the same industry should only help each other and save each other, and not kill each other in competition, then all competitive power between individuals does not lie in the promotion of value, but in the quality and cost. If we can strive to reduce costs in terms of cost and strive to make products exquisite in terms of production, we can be sure of victory, take the upper hand, and not worry about losses or failures. Therefore, today's national products sector should implement scientific management, conduct cost accounting, eliminate unnecessary waste, and eliminate unnecessary equipment and personnel, so that it can compete with the dumping of foreign goods.</p>
<p>(4) Study Buyer Psychology. A major problem with our national products is closing the door to build a car and sticking to one's own opinions without catering to the psychology of general users, so that all products are sold in area A but cannot be sold in area B. Selling products at the factory becomes easy to accumulate and stagnate, and capital is stagnant and turnover is poor, which is also a shortcoming of today's national products sector. If we can make the manufacturers study buyer psychology, focus on the preferences of users in various places, and strive for the modernization and simplification of products in order to promote the production of products as much as possible, then the difficulties of the past may be reduced.</p>
<p>The above refers to the manufacturers themselves. At the same time, sellers should also adhere to the idea of only selling national products, strive to promote sales, and do their best to serve, so that national products that have come from struggle and hard work have the opportunity to develop and promote. This is the most effective way to help the national economy. Furthermore, in terms of the government, the government does not need to say more, but to follow the essential methods: (1) improve the organization of the same industry and use gradual control, (2) reduce donations and taxes, abolish unreasonable special donations and special taxes in various provinces, (3) improve the transportation organization and reduce its costs at the same time, (4) join with the financial sector to organize an industrial loan syndicate as a backing for the national products industry and provide security for the financial sector, (5) lead the provinces, cities, and counties to connect the transportation and sales of machine products and local products so that machine products are transported internally and local products are sold externally, not only achieving the goal of barter but also inducing the purchasing power of inland rural areas and expanding the field of local products and national products, (6) assist rural sideline occupations in various places to enrich the lives of farmers, so that everyone has the ability to purchase national products, which is a basic work to promote national products.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also have advice for the general public: national products have today's achievements, and I don't know how much brainpower, how much effort, and how much blood and tears have been spent to get such a price. If national products are equal to foreign goods, use national products. If national products have the same value as foreign goods, use national products. Even if the quality of national products is inferior to foreign goods, use national products. If the value of national products is more expensive than foreign goods, use national products. National products should be forgiven everywhere, applied with guidance, supported, and determined. It is right and proper for Chinese people to use Chinese goods, there is nothing to doubt, there is nothing to consider. The Japanese who live in China use their own national products for everything, even a cigarette, a match, a piece of paper, a drink, a needle, and a thread. If they use foreign goods, they consider it a great disrespect and a lifelong shame. Is there any nation in the world that takes pride in using foreign goods? I love fashionable people who are happy to use foreign goods. Why not think about it, why not be self-aware? This alone is the way out for the national economy, in factories, in businesses, in the government, and in the people, and all can do it. If this is not done, it is equivalent to sitting and waiting for the country to perish, there is no excuse for it, and there is no escaping responsibility.</p>

<p>National products are especially vibrant in summer! As the fiery canopy hangs high, the heat is steaming people! If one returns home from public duties, barefoot, waving a cattail fan, living in a small home, and facing national products, how happy! The various fruit dew of Guan Sheng Yuan are fine wines and jade liquids! Red and green are distinct! The Star perfume of the China Pharmaceutical Factory is fragrant! The Samsung mosquito coils and Samsung toothpaste of the China Chemical Industry Society, the body powder of the Family Industry Society, the Zhuluo tents and Qingqi tents and towel quilts of the Sanyou Society, the medicated soap and insecticide water of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and the Ya Pu'er blue electric bulbs, electric fans, and the Wu Sa La soy sauce, Meilin fruit jam, and Sanle honey peaches and candied fruit of other companies... Everything, national products in summer, are especially vibrant! Moreover, snow lotus root is used to mix ice, and plums and watermelons float! Reading national product publications is another kind of fun! Why bother entering the whisky-smelling dance hall, going up the volcano! And going to the air-conditioned!

<p>Short Message</p>
<p>The purpose of Meixing toothpaste is to develop abroad, so it is not very common in the market. It has a long and commendable history, which is worth mentioning. Three or four years ago, the South Seas Islands was the most popular time for Meixing toothpaste because of its pure quality and low price, which was welcomed by the local officials. But this also aroused great jealousy from foreign merchants, who used their special power to devise various methods to sabotage and encroach. However, Meixing toothpaste still struggled in the difficult environment, and at the same time, it also occupied a large position in Guangdong and Guangxi.

<p>(Reuters, Lima, Peru, 10th) Today, General Pina Videz ordered the Peruvian delegation to withdraw from the Berlin World Games to protest the cancellation of Peru's victory over Austria in soccer.

<p>Peruvian Athletes Leave Berlin</p>

<h3 id="e147">Our Entire Army Was Defeated; The Reason Was Arriving in Germany Too Late; Exhaustion from the Journey Prevented Recovery of Strength; Hoping the Countrymen Will Strive to Erase Today's Shame; Basketball Tournament Enters Fourth Week <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, August 11th, via Wireless Broadcast. Yesterday's basketball games included four matches: (1) Poland vs. Latvia, halftime score 14-12, final score 28-23, Poland wins; (2) Mexico vs. Egypt, halftime score 16-8, final score 32-10, Mexico wins; (3) Brazil vs. China, halftime score 16-5, final score 32-14, Brazil wins; (4) Czechoslovakia vs. Germany, halftime score 11-6, final score 20-9, Czechoslovakia wins. Therefore, Poland, Brazil, Mexico, and Czechoslovakia have entered the third week. Today's schedule is (1) Estonia vs. Philippines, (2) Chile vs. Italy, (3) Mexico vs. Japan, (4) Sweden vs. Canada, (5) Czechoslovakia vs. Uruguay, (6) Poland vs. Brazil. The United States has a bye. The winners will advance to the fourth week, and the losers will compete against each other again. In yesterday's basketball game between China and Brazil, the Brazilian team's skills were quite good, especially the center, who was the most excellent. Whether it was long shots or close-range shots under the basket, they were all successful. Therefore, Brazil's victory yesterday must be attributed to the center. Conversely, our team was the complete opposite. Not only were long shots unsuccessful, but also close-range shots under the basket did not go in. It seemed that all the players could not exert their strength. Lack of training was one of the reasons, but physical inferiority was indeed a major factor in the failure. As a result, we lost with a score of 14-32. In other competitions, we were also completely defeated. Overall, our country's participation in this World Games can be said to be a complete defeat. The reason was that we arrived in Germany too late. The athletes were exhausted from the long journey, and their physical strength could not be restored. After arriving in Germany, they were not acclimatized to the environment, which affected their health. Therefore, they could not compete with other countries. The most fundamental reason was the lack of physical strength, training, and experience. Compared with other countries, the gap was vast. This is greatly related to the health of the nation. However, it is somewhat comforting that although the football team lost to England, all parties praised them highly. The basketball team was also able to fight fiercely in several games, leaving a deep impression on various countries. Therefore, this trip cannot be said to be a complete failure. However, compared with our neighboring country Japan, the difference is immeasurable. It is hoped that the countrymen will work hard to strengthen their bodies in the future to erase today's shame.</p>

<h3 id="e160">On the Deck of the Kontor Float (5) From Bombay to Madenwa <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for this Newspaper Yu Yi Sends</p>
<p>Around 2 PM on July 9th, after arriving in Bombay, India, since there was a six-hour stopover, the team members split into groups, three to five in a group, and went ashore to various places to visit, to relieve the boredom of sea life. Those who boarded the ship from Bombay included Li Huitang, Bao Jiaping, Huang Jiliang, Li Tiansheng, Tan Jiangbai, Mai Shaohan, Cai Wenli, Huang Meiyi, Xu Yahui, Chen Zhenhe, Li Guowei, Liang Rongzhao, Liang Shutang, Zheng Jiliang, Yang Shuiyi, Zhuo Shijin, Feng Jinxiang, Zhang Xianyuan, Sun Jinshun, Ye Beihua, Cao Guicheng, and Jia Youliang, 24 members of our country's World Games football delegation who had fought in various parts of Southeast Asia for a long time, as well as director Rong Qizhao and manager Huang Jiajun. Coach Yan Chengkun will remain in the port, and it is heard that he will take a plane to Berlin in the near future. Our football team fought against the Bombay Essence Team on July 8, resulting in a 3-3 draw. According to local Western newspapers, our team's attacking and defending connection technology cooperation is above Bombay's, especially Li Huitang, Cao Guicheng, and Sun Jinshun, who performed well, but the opponent's defense was tight, and our team was tired from the journey, so we were unable to deeply wound the enemy. After the floating platform left Bombay at 8:00 PM on the 9th, it encountered storms when it lingered in the Arabian Sea on the 9th, 10th, and 11th for three days, and the vibrations were quite strong. More than half of the team members suffered from seasickness, and all activities were temporarily suspended. It was not until noon on the 13th that things calmed down, and the team began to resume their activities. The Weiqi championship competition began at 10:00 AM on July 13th, with more than ten participants including Hao Gengsheng, Feng Youzhen, Li Zhou, Qian Yiqin, Wang Shoufang, and Liu Yunzhang. The final was held on July 18th, with Wang Shoufang having the highest voice for the championship.</p>

<p>(6) From Massawa to Venice</p>
<p>Arrived in Massawa around 3:00 PM on July 14th. Massawa is an important town in Italian Eritrea, Africa, and was a key transportation route for the Italian army during the invasion of Abyssinia. The entire town is very small. Aside from the stationed Italian army, there is no trade and nothing worth seeing. Several hundred Italian soldiers boarded the ship from here, presumably returning home in triumph. The weather in Africa is extremely hot, and quite a few passengers on the ship fell ill. Three Westerners died on the ship while passing through the seas. Several members of our delegation also became sick, with Wu Bixian's condition being more serious. Fortunately, he fully recovered after four days. Due to the accompanying doctor's inability to fulfill his duties, many members of the delegation became ill. It is regrettable that they had to voluntarily pay for medical treatment from the ship's doctor.</p>
<p>The floating platform arrived at Port Said at 3:00 PM on July 17th. Except for a very few members who joined the China Travel Service's organized tour of Cairo, Egypt, and disembarked at Suez, the rest of us stayed on the ship to pass through the canal. Although this port of Said is small, it is quite clean and tidy. Many members of the delegation purchased Egyptian products and returned to the ship. The ship set sail directly for Italy at 7:00 PM that afternoon. At 10:00 AM on July 18th, our delegation held a plenary meeting, chaired by Shen Siliang. It was said that countries must first become members of the World Games Federation in order to participate. The organization of the Games is actually composed of various international sports federations. Any country wishing to participate in a particular sport must first become a member of the international federation for that sport. The World Games Federation has a committee, and it is a great honor that Mr. Wang Zhengting, our country's representative, is also an official of that organization. This time, our country is participating in seven events: (1) Athletics, (2) Basketball, (3) Football, (4) Weightlifting, (5) Swimming, (6) Cycling, (7) Art. Our country had already joined the above-mentioned international sports federations in advance. The significance of our delegation's participation in this World Games is as follows: (1) From the perspective of the inspection team, its mission is to learn from others' strengths and make up for its own shortcomings. (2) From the perspective of the athletes, our country's athletes in general are quite arrogant and conceited. They need to learn humbly and must not think that running and jumping is the end of it. They must take the initiative to learn. Even after the Games are over, they must continue to work hard to practice. Ma Dehan gave a speech, roughly saying that we are "representatives." The word "representative" means responsibility, duty. You must understand what you represent. (1) Others see a representative as representing all Chinese people. (2) When dealing with competition referees and perceived injustices, never lose your temper. Pay attention to spiritual cultivation and have "youthful spirit." The so-called youthful spirit is (1) agility, (2) liveliness, (3) spirit of service, (4) discipline. We, as instructors, administrators, and athletes, should all "love our country." At the very least, "what I do should not disgrace my country." Hao Gengsheng said (1) We can fail in skills, but we must never fail in spirit. Even if we lose, we must lose honorably and show that our country has promise. (2) Remember not to let people make fun of us, because enemies and friends alike will expose our weaknesses and let people all over the world know. (3) We must have national consciousness. When Chinese people learn from others' strengths, we must not forget that we are Chinese. It is truly commendable that we can still go abroad to compete when the domestic situation is so difficult. Each representative should pay attention to (1) protecting your own body, (2) maintaining the spirit of a great Chinese citizen, (3) preparing to fight for the country in the international arena.</p>
<p>The German consultant, Kautz, then delivered a speech to welcome our delegation, translated by Ms. Mei Fuxiang. He roughly said that soon we will arrive in Berlin, Germany, and the people of all of Germany are very honored to be able to receive such an excellent Chinese delegation. I (Kautz speaking of himself) take this opportunity to represent the German government and its leaders in expressing twelve points of sincerity in welcoming you all. I believe that the German people will do their best to ensure that your stay is a great success and comfort. However, if there are any shortcomings, please consider the great difficulties that Germany is undertaking for this conference. In Berlin alone, there were originally four million residents, and it is expected that there will be eight million guests from various countries attending this World Games. You must know that the wishes of the German people are purely good. From the lowest person on the street to the highest leader, all will do their best to satisfy guests from all countries, without a doubt. This sentiment is especially directed towards our Chinese friends. The relationship between China and Germany has always been friendly. All Germans who have lived in China and returned to their country cannot forget your great nation. The German people are striving to deepen the friendship between the two countries. This time, your country has sent such a fine delegation to Germany, which can be said to be the beginning of a historical era. Your country's culture is superior, which is not only deeply understood by Germany, but also known to all of Europe. Therefore, it increases the responsibility that you bear for your country's people and nation. Not only the people of Germany, but also the people of the world are watching closely at this time. Therefore, even the slightest of your actions is related to the reputation of your country and people. May you not fail the mission of your country in sending you to Germany, bring glory to the country, and open your eyes, then honor and victory, perhaps there will be, perhaps there will not be, but success ultimately belongs to you and your country. After the speech, Xu Minhui led everyone in cheering before dismissing the meeting. The delegation's Go (Weiqi) championship, organized by the Entertainment Committee, has been underway since July 13th. All contestants have been competing in an orderly manner. The final between Feng Youzhen and Wang Shoufang took place on July 18th. As a result, Wang won the championship with a score of two to one.</p>
<p>In recent days, the inspection team has held multiple meetings and has properly assigned personnel to each group to facilitate future inspections. The list of personnel in each group is as follows:</p>
<p>(Administrative Group) Wu Bangwei, Li Zhou, Xu Yingchao, Xu Minhui, Fu Jingru, Zhang Huilan, Shao Rugan. Secretary: Xu Minhui. (Conveners) Wu Bangwei, Shao Rugan.

<p>The ship Conti di Savoia arrived in Brindisi, Italy, at 10:00 PM on July 19th. Due to the late hour, members of the delegation did not disembark. The ship continued its journey at 2:00 AM that night. The Conti di Savoia arrived safely in Venice at around 10:00 PM on July 20th. The entire delegation disembarked, thus ending the life on the floating platform. The sea voyage totaled 8,473 miles. After landing, we spent the night in a hostel and then took a special train to Germany at 11:45 AM on July 21st, passing through Austria. We will enter German territory at 9:38 PM that afternoon (the train may be changed upon arrival in Germany). We will arrive at Berlin Station at 8:47 AM on July 22nd. The Chinese Ambassador to Germany, members of the World Games Preparatory Committee, and over 300 overseas Chinese students will be waiting at the station to greet us. After disembarking, the entire delegation will proceed to the Berlin City Hall to attend a welcome rally. After the meeting, the staff and athletes of each team will go directly to the Olympic Village dormitory. The male members of the inspection team will go to the International Sports Academy Camp, and the female members who will be attending the Hamburg Recreational Society and staying at the women's dormitory will depart that afternoon. Before the opening of the Games, the athletes will continue to train to restore their usual skills in preparation for a fierce competition in the Games.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Prohibition of Female Teachers from Perming Hair and Applying Rouge: Small Education Federation Petitions the Municipal Education Bureau <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai News Agency) The Shanghai Primary School Staff Federation, yesterday, in view of the fact that the perming of hair and application of rouge by female teachers in various schools in the city hinders the promotion of the New Life Movement, specially submitted a petition to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting rectification. The original petition stated, "It is found that the purpose of the New Life Movement is to train the public to develop habits of cleanliness and simplicity, and to cultivate the spirit of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Although the specifics are minor, the results are substantial. Once promoted, it is being implemented nationwide. Various agencies in this city have repeatedly received orders and instructions from higher authorities to proceed with the steps. The prohibition of perming hair, applying rouge, heavy makeup, and flamboyant clothing has been effectively implemented for female students in various schools. Recently, it has been observed that female teachers in various schools hold teaching positions and are listed as teachers. Observing their appearance, one only sees hair like monstrous waves and faces like fortified walls. Their attire includes bare feet in leather shoes and short-sleeved thin shirts. Using this to serve society and educate children, is this not a strange thing in the world? In recent years, international trade has seen women's cosmetics as a major import. How can the country bear to engage in such wasteful and expensive endeavors? This Association feels apprehensive and dares to petition your esteemed bureau to first rectify the female staff within the bureau and then issue a notice to all female teachers in various schools to comply uniformly. As an ancient person said, 'Please start with me,' so that the future of the New Movement can be promoted and developed through the efforts of the female community, and the future of education can advance without limit through the rectification of female teachers. If this is appropriate, we humbly beseech your review and approval for implementation, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<h3 id="e172">A Radical Cure for "Nocturnal Emission" Caused by Masturbation <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The commonly recognized effects of masturbation include: high-level neurasthenia, weak constitution, gastrointestinal disorders, and poor development of reproductive organs. These are all caused by the direct causes of the bad habit or by its indirect relationship.</p>
<p>In addition, men who still have a foreskin after reaching a certain age are very likely to induce masturbatory behavior due to the stimulation of secretions accumulated in the foreskin. In other cases, due to the improvement of living standards, marriage problems have become more difficult, and prostitution requires money, which is difficult for young people feeling economic pressure. The impulse of temporary lust can only be resolved by masturbation. This is the reason why the bad habit of masturbation is becoming increasingly prevalent!</p>
<p>The first symptom after masturbation is nocturnal emission. Nocturnal emission is the most drastic and fastest thing that damages the human body. It can quickly turn a strong young man into a patient with neurasthenia. Therefore, most scholars unanimously believe that there is a close relationship between neurasthenia and nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>In short, after nocturnal emission caused by masturbation, obstacles will occur in the nervous system because the sperm gate is loose, losing the ability to control ejaculation. Therefore, the method of radical cure must start with consolidating the essence and treat it with "Hemet's Sperm Consolidation Tablets," and at the same time take "Reproductive Essence," which is the most potent for nourishing the reproductive glands. Because prolonged nocturnal emission causes excessive consumption of energy and semen, the body is inevitably weak, so it is necessary to restore its weakness with "Reproductive Essence" before a radical cure can be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Reliable Ways to Treat Leukorrhea <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>There are countless reasons for infertility, the most direct of which are naturally sexually transmitted diseases and hidden illnesses, especially leukorrhea, premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, and nocturnal emission are the most common. "Reproductive Essence" is available to treat premature ejaculation and kidney atrophy, and "Hemet's Sperm Consolidation Tablets" are used to treat nocturnal emission, which will not be discussed here. Now, in terms of leukorrhea, there is much value in studying its treatment methods.</p>
<p>Vaccine therapy is the newest theory, the deepest knowledge, and the most effective. It is not something that ordinary people can know. For example, oral vaccines have long been appreciated and used by medical circles and famous doctors in various countries to prevent and treat typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, leukorrhea, etc. As for the preparation method of gonococcus vaccine, it is not always necessary to prepare the vaccine from the bacteria itself, just as humans need to get vaccinated with cowpox vaccine. Please do not easily believe the ignorant and absurd remarks of those with shallow knowledge, deceiving the world and misleading people. However, leukorrhea cannot be cured with just one type of vaccine. It must be based on purified oral yellow pigment, which has the rapid and effective effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria. "Antilin" uses these two methods to complement each other, so its effect on eliminating gonorrhea and clearing turbidity is unparalleled for a time. As for women's leukorrhea and uterine inflammation, in addition to the external use of "Band-Relief Spirit," taking "Antilin" internally at the same time will speed up the treatment. Those in the world who suffer from leukorrhea and other symptoms, leading to prolonged marriage and infertility, should pay attention!</p>
<p>One Medical Case of Leukorrhea</p>
<p>Recently, a patient named Xu Shuntai, from Jiashan, Zhejiang, suffered from leukorrhea for three years. Initially, due to improper treatment, it turned from acute to chronic. Although he took many kinds of medicine in between, it was still ineffective. Sometimes he felt superficially cured while taking the medicine, but he was repeatedly infected within a few months. After a year of this, the disease gradually worsened. Not only was he thin and emaciated, but his spirit was also weakened. He had suffered from gonorrhea for too long, and his body's vitality had been almost completely damaged. It was not until this spring that he was introduced by his cousin, Mr. Jin Zhouli, to take the oral medicine "Antilin," which is made of yellow pigment and vaccine. After that, the symptoms improved. After taking four boxes, the turbidity stopped. However, his body was still weak, so he also took "Reproductive Essence" at the same time to replenish his physical weakness. In less than two months, his spirit was strong, his complexion was rosy, and his appetite had increased, and his weight had increased by as much as twelve pounds. In total, Mr. Xu suffered from leukorrhea for three years before he was able to be radically cured this spring, which can be said to be extremely fortunate. It also proves the miraculous effect of "Antilin."</p>
<p>It is truly not comparable to other inferior medicines.</p>

<h3 id="e174">An Excellent Example for Those Suffering from Reproductive Dysfunction <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Mr. Luo Guida has been doing business in Shanghai for seven years. He is from Guangfu Town, Suzhou, and is now twenty-eight years old. His body was originally weak, and four years ago, after developing a habit of masturbation, he often suffered from nocturnal emissions. Last winter, he married a Miss Wang in his hometown. After the wedding, his weakened body was unable to cope, and after two months, he suffered from premature ejaculation, followed by impotence. He was panic-stricken and took various medications, but with little effect. At the end of April this year, he was introduced to me by a friend, Mr. Chen Zhenyuan, for treatment. I diagnosed that Mr. Luo's reproductive glands had been damaged, so I used "Reproductive Essence" as my main medication. Because "Reproductive Essence" is purely refined from the reproductive glands of strong animals, it is indeed effective in restoring health to those with weakened reproductive function. Therefore, after Mr. Luo received "Reproductive Essence" to nourish his body, his condition improved. After taking two boxes, he felt his vitality strengthened and his interest doubled. He took about half a dozen boxes, and all his reproductive dysfunction was completely and thoroughly cured. Not only did his muscles become firm, but his complexion became rosy, and he also gained weight. Now he is able to enjoy a fulfilling and satisfying sex life, it is said.</p>
<p>Another patient suffered from the harm of gonorrhea, resulting in the loss of sexual ability. His condition was extremely serious, and he also had headaches, tinnitus, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, and exhaustion, among other symptoms. He had nocturnal emissions at least five times a week and was addicted to smoking. He thought he would never recover his health. Unexpectedly, I used several powerful and effective medicines to save him from the brink of death. His name is Lin, from Changxing, Zhejiang. He is thirty-four years old and has been married for nearly eight years. In addition to using "Reproductive Essence" to restore his sexual function and regulate his addiction to smoking, I also injected him with 20 CC of "Yuwei Cibaoming." At the same time, I used "Anti-Gonorrhea," a gonorrhea treatment drug made from yellow pigment and Vaksin, to eliminate his chronic gonorrhea of many years in one fell swoop. Because he still suffered from severe nocturnal emissions, I used "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to treat it. He took four boxes of "Reproductive Essence," four boxes of "Anti-Gonorrhea," and two boxes of "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Pills," and completely cured Mr. Lin, who was suffering from a multitude of diseases. It can be said that he was fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Three Short-Term Treatments for Premature Ejaculation <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<p>……The three categories of cerebral, spinal cord, and peripheral, and their treatments……A thorough understanding of the fundamental treatments and points to note……An overview of the harms of premature ejaculation and the pain suffered by the partner.</p>
<p>Premature ejaculation is a functional neurological disorder, but it is different from neurasthenic impotence. Hypersensitivity of the ejaculatory nerve center and the conduction glands is the cause of this disease. The main factors that contribute to this cause are entirely due to systemic nutritional disorders, or bad habits of masturbation during the developmental period, and congenital deficiencies and acquired maladjustments. It can also occur when other serious illnesses have not fully recovered, or from opium or morphine poisoning. Therefore, treatment must pay attention to each of these causes and the method of fundamental eradication.</p>
<p>(1) Symptoms of Cerebral Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>This type of premature ejaculation occurs in the first stage of neurasthenic impotence. The erectile center of the spinal cord is damaged. When an erection is not sufficient or there is no erection at all, the ejaculatory center becomes excited first, resulting in the act of ejaculation.</p>
<p>According to the ordinary phenomenon, the erectile center is extremely excited first, which then causes the excitation of the ejaculatory center, and then there is the act of ejaculation. However, when the erectile center is damaged, it is not yet excited, but the ejaculatory center becomes excited first, resulting in ejaculation. At this time, if the excitation of the mental center is added, the phenomenon becomes even more severe, even leading to nocturnal emissions without an erection during the day. This type is called cerebral premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>(2) The Pathway of Spinal Cord Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Early ejaculation, in addition to the above, can also be caused by the action of the mind, that is, when strong sexual concepts are felt in the brain, the stimulation of the senses can also excite the ejaculatory center, resulting in premature ejaculation, which is also a common occurrence.</p>
<p>(3) Peripheral Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>The cause of peripheral premature ejaculation is mostly swelling and hypersensitivity of the seminal vesicles. The inflammation of the seminal vesicles is mostly due to masturbation, or contracting gonorrhea during intercourse. The inflammation of the seminal vesicles then harms the ejaculatory center. Among the above types of premature ejaculation, the most effective treatment is the method of supplementing the reproductive glands. At this time, "Reproductive Essence" should be taken, which will revitalize the body and replenish energy, and the partner can deeply gain a strong sense of pleasure. Otherwise, the partner's feelings will be like chewing wax.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Bone Pain</p>
<p>— (Physician Wang Shiying)</p>
<p>Treatment of Long-Term Bone Pain</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Ge: A businessman from Changsha, aged forty-six. Mr. Ge traveled extensively and was exposed to the elements, resulting in cold and dampness accumulating internally, developing into bone pain. When the pain was severe, it was like being pierced or tortured, causing extreme suffering and inexplicable distress. Later, through the introduction of his close relatives, he took the famous medicine "Strongton's Stomach Pain Pills." After taking the pills, the effect was significant, and he continued to take five boxes with peace of mind. His joints immediately felt relaxed. Although he continues to work tirelessly, he has not felt any pain. According to him, "I have suffered from bone pain for eight years. I have taken more than a dozen kinds of medicines for treating bone pain. Although some of them were effective after taking them, they relapsed after stopping the medication, so the results were difficult to guarantee thoroughly. Now, after taking five boxes of 'Strongton's Bone Pain Pills,' the situation is very different. Since I stopped taking the medicine after recovering this spring, it has been more than eight months and has not relapsed. This is why I am so surprised."</p>
<p>Rejuvenation from Smoking Addiction and Bone Pain</p>
<p>Another patient is a woman who is addicted to smoking. Her bone pain started before she became addicted. She was deceived by the claim that smoking could reduce the pain, so she became addicted to smoking. Just this spring, her sister introduced her to "Strongton's Bone Pain Pills." After taking three boxes, she felt her joints relaxed and recovered quickly. At the same time, she used "Reproductive Essence" to quit her smoking addiction. Therefore, before the age of forty, her smoking addiction and bone pain were swept away by two effective medicines. It has been five months since then, and she has never relapsed.</p>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Nocturnal Emissions and Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Patient surnamed Bao, from Hangzhou, aged twenty-six, has been in Shanghai for seven years, working as a metal broker. (Chief complaint) – Not yet married. Sexual function is normal, but when urinating or during erection, a large amount of seminal fluid flows out of the urethra. After urination, a viscous, transparent liquid is always seen outside the urethral opening. After sleeping, he wakes up with seminal fluid all over his pants. Especially after hard work during the day. Recently, he has been experiencing palpitations, extreme fatigue, a sharp decline in memory, mental depression, and occasional tinnitus and headaches. (Current symptoms) – Symptoms of neurasthenia, enlarged and congested prostate. Examination of the viscous substance reveals prostatic fluid and a large number of sperm. (Treatment method) – After diagnosing his condition, in addition to electrotherapy, I cooled his posterior urethra and massaged his prostate. I used "Reproductive Essence" to nourish his depleted body, and at the same time used "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" to cure his nocturnal emissions. After taking about three boxes of each, he was completely cured in less than six weeks.</p>
<p>(2) Underdevelopment and Phimosis</p>
<p>Patient Xu Xiaoquan, aged twenty, resides at No. 3, Yuqing Lane, Dong Tangjia Lane, in this city. His father is a clerk in a silk shop, and he is also learning the trade in the silk shop. (Chief complaint) – He has been masturbating since the age of fifteen and still cannot completely quit. His penis is thin and his testicles are very small. Even when he uses his fingers to retract the foreskin, the glans cannot be exposed. The tip of the foreskin has only a small opening. When urinating, the urine first flows into the space between the foreskin and the glans, and then is discharged from there. The same is true during ejaculation, which is extremely unpleasant. Frequent erections. Nocturnal emissions and spermatorrhea are quite painful. (Current symptoms) – Underdevelopment of the penis, testicles, and prostate. Increased reflexes, complicated by neurasthenia. (Treatment method) – First, local anesthesia was administered, and a small amount of the constricted ring-shaped portion of the tip of the foreskin was removed, forming a ring. Suturing was painless. Then, "Reproductive Essence" was used to restore his energy, eliminate his neurasthenia, and aid his development. "Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Pills" were used to strengthen his spermatic duct and cure his nocturnal emissions. His spirits gradually became refreshed, his neurasthenia disappeared, and after two months of medication, he fully regained his development and his nocturnal emissions were cured early.</p>
<p>Experiments with Famous Medicines</p>
<p>Successful Beauty</p>
<p>Due to congenital deficiencies, even at the age of sixteen, which is the developmental period, I still had no satisfactory development. My breasts were shriveled, and my waist, hips, and other areas lacked beautiful curves. In addition, my menstruation was irregular, and I was constantly frowning with worry. It wasn't until last winter, after taking a "Female Reproductive Essence," that the situation changed dramatically. My muscles developed immediately, and my breasts became high and full, with elasticity. I have fully achieved my beautiful figure. After appearing in public swimming pools several times this summer, I received much envy and praise from others. This was truly the most prominent day of my life. Zheng Zhijie</p>
<p>Experience with Stomach Problems</p>
<p>I am forty years old, and although I am in my prime, due to my weak constitution, my stomach and intestines are not very healthy. Not only do I have frequent stomach pains, but my digestion is also very weak, so my whole body is malnourished, and I feel that both my energy and semen are withering. This April, through the introduction of a friend, I took "Stomach Pain Pills" and "Stomach-Strengthening Essence," and unexpectedly eliminated my stomach problems of many years. It can be said that I am fortunate. Xu Zhongda</p>
<p>Secret Treatment for Leukorrhea</p>
<p>I am a physically weak woman, twenty-two years old this year. I have been married for four years and have not yet conceived. I also suffer from leukorrhea, which causes me great mental distress. I really have no way to think of anything. The flow is gradually increasing and emitting a strange odor. This summer, my husband and I bought a box of "Leukorrhea-Curing Elixir" to use. The leukorrhea decreased immediately. In less than two months, my lower body was unusually clean. I only used about two boxes, which shows that its effect is remarkable. Xia Suxin</p>
<p>Bone Pain and Limb Pain</p>
<p>Several years ago, I suffered from joint pain and numbness in my limbs. Although I sought medical treatment and took various medications at that time, there was no obvious effect. Last winter, the symptoms became severe, to the point where it was inconvenient to move half of my body, and my limbs also felt faintly numb. I was very afraid. Later, through the introduction of a friend, I took "Strongton's Bone Pain Pills." After taking three boxes, my bone pain and limb pain were completely cured. It has been six months since then, and it has never relapsed.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Grains: Japanese Still Buying Wheat <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was generally flat after the opening in the morning. Although the price of foreign wheat continued to fall sharply, the demand for spot wheat from factories suddenly became active, unlike the dullness of the previous week. The goods were also purchased at higher prices, and the Japanese traders also made transactions every day, which made people more confident. Therefore, although the price of foreign wheat was slightly lower, the market atmosphere remained stable. Only the prices for this month to November were slightly lower by one cent, and the prices for December and January were also flat at the beginning. Then, as buying interest increased, the prices rebounded by three cents. According to the current trend, it is difficult to predict a decline in the short term. The spot wheat market was active due to the mutual buying interest of factories and Japanese traders, and the demand was very strong. Each supplier secretly raised prices by five cents. Chen wheat from Yaowan was quoted at four yuan and ninety cents, Zhangbaling Yaowan wheat at four yuan and ninety cents, Jiehe wheat at four yuan and ninety-five cents, Gaoyou wheat at four yuan and seventy cents, Wuhu wheat at four yuan and sixty-eight cents, second-grade at six cents, Wuyi wheat at four yuan and seventy-eight cents, Yangzhou wheat at four yuan and fifty-five cents, Shiying wheat at four yuan and sixty-seven or eight cents, Liuhe wheat at four yuan and sixty-seven, eight, or nine cents, Huaian wheat at four yuan and seventy cents, Hankou wheat at four yuan and sixty-eight cents, settled at six cents, second-grade at five cents. Fuxin purchased 10,000 bags, Fufeng purchased 9,000 bags, and Shenda purchased 3,000 bags. It is said that the highest-quality goods have been sold to the Japanese traders for five yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Future of the Flour Market Still Holds Changes <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a trend of softening first and then rising. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago continued to fall by forty or fifty cents, and in Canada, the near-term fell by one yuan and the far-term fell by ninety-seven cents. Therefore, people were very calm when the prices opened. The opening price for this month was only one cent and two points, and the prices for September to December were also slightly lower by one or two points. However, the price for January did not fall but rose instead. Therefore, after the opening of these two rounds of trading, people's confidence immediately rose. At that time, actual sales customers from the north and south also traded spot flour, and futures were also being purchased, so people's confidence suddenly became firm, jumping by two or three points compared to the initial round. After the third round, the prices were relatively flat, and buying and selling transactions were still active. According to estimates by those in the industry, the market value of foreign wheat is difficult to agree on for the time being. If they gradually approach, there will be huge changes in the future.</p>

<p>Since the recent two months, the price of flour in this city has soared. However, the Tianjin suppliers are not deterred by the high prices and are actively competing to purchase flour, and the factories are largely unable to meet the demand. Since the turmoil in Guangdong and Guangxi, Nan Hua has also shipped large quantities of flour and rice to those areas. Yesterday, the British company's "Sumandri" steamer set sail for Europe with 4,000 bags of flour destined for Singapore. The reporter heard this and considered that flour exports have been rare in recent years. I made a special inquiry, and the company stated that flour exports have indeed been rare recently, but they were common during the European war twenty years ago. This is the first time for this export, and it is feared that there will be more in the future. It is also heard that several thousand more bags will be shipped to Medan, Dutch East Indies, tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Zhuangqiao New Early Rice Has Been Launched <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>—Sluggish Sales…Prices Fall Gradually— (South Shanghai) Yesterday, various suppliers arrived with about fifteen or sixteen consignments, totaling nearly 3,000 shih. Sales in the street market were slack, and even the Qingdao suppliers only purchased a little over 300 bags. Therefore, the market situation was weak, and the price of thick early rice fell by five cents. Due to the drastic drop in new early rice prices, the price of thin rice continued to fall by one or two corners. Du Yangjian has not yet opened for trading, and the market is uncertain. A total of 1,500 shih arrived at the Dongxin North and South markets, causing the prices to fall further by two jiao. Zhuangqiao new early rice has been launched, and the quality is quite good. A little over one hundred shih arrived, and the price opened at ten yuan and three jiao.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fifteen or sixteen consignments arrived from various sources downstream. The various destinations in the market were still sluggish. Early-market prices for white polished rice were stable, and evening prices were slightly volatile. The prices for Yuan Bian and various Xian rice were stable. The price of thin rice was slightly lower by nearly one jiao. A large quantity of Dongxin Japonica rice arrived, and sales were poor, causing the price to fall by another two jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Jiangxi Rice Arrivals Still Expected <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of guest Xian early rice remained active. New rice, such as that from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Jiangxi, continued to arrive. However, yesterday's guest purchases were very strong. In addition to a small amount of domestic demand, suppliers from Quanzhou were newly purchasing late rice from Jiaying. Although the quantity traded was small, the situation had improved. The Quanzhou suppliers and local businesses absorbed the Zhongguan Jiwan late rice, and the price was secretly raised by five or six cents. The total amount of Jiangxi rice sold was 2,350 bags, Hunan rice was 1,000 bags, and Taizhou new rice was 200 bags. Except for a slight increase in the price of Jiwan late rice, other prices were also slightly strong.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Shantou Suppliers Suddenly Increase Soybean Cake Purchases <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Soybean cake sales are usually abandoned by those who are planning for the autumn season, so the overall market situation is stable. However, yesterday, Shantou suppliers suddenly increased their purchases, so most factories had no spot goods to sell. As a result, they made orders for future delivery, which also boosted the domestic sales of autumn cakes. Therefore, the prices rose by two or three cents. The total transaction volume was 2,000 pieces of current output four brand, 30,000 pieces for delivery in five to ten days, 18,000 pieces for delivery in fifteen days, 3,000 pieces of three brand for delivery in ten days, and 1,100 pieces of genuine brand for delivery in five days. Afterwards, due to the past-peak sales season, it is difficult to predict whether prices will rise or fall.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Yarn and Cotton: Profit-Taking and Offsetting Purchases Occur One After Another. Yarn Re-Enters the 200 Yuan Level This Month <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>After the sharp decline in the yarn market the day before, it became stable again yesterday and tended to rise. The reason is that the solid decline in American cotton was not as much as expected, so a rebound occurred suddenly, causing profit-takers to offset their positions. Market prices rose slowly, and the price for this month re-entered the level above 200 yuan. However, Ruida continued to sell off in large quantities, but the surface was not significantly affected. In fact, the inventory in Shanghai is shrinking, and the yarn market itself can be consolidated temporarily.</p>
<p>Tendered Yarn Ruida Sells Off in Large Quantities</p>
<p>The price of tendered yarn opened lower in the pre-market trading session. The sharp decline the day before was too severe, but yesterday the decline in American cotton was still good, which led to profit-taking and offset purchases. In addition, the gold industry suppliers did not relax their efforts, and the market situation became stable. Although the selling was strong, it was not significantly affected. Prices for all months rose by seven or eight jiao. The prices for the near-term months fell slightly in the second round of trading, while the prices for the far-term months were firm and unmoved. By the third closing, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were still quite good, and the inventory in the warehouses was gradually flowing. People's confidence was revived, and as a result, the prices for all months rose by one yuan to one yuan and twenty-four, five, or six jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. It was found that Ruida sold 4,500 bales, Tongji 950 bales, Dafeng 1,650 bales, Daji 1,300 bales, Zhenda 900 bales, Senkang 1,150 bales, Shenji 750 bales, Weifeng 2,400 bales, Yongyu 600 bales, and Xincheng 550 bales. Gengfeng purchased 2,700 bales, Jifeng 900 bales, Yukang 900 bales, Hexing 1,000 bales, Yuanyi 1,100 bales, Taichang 1,700 bales, Runkang 650 bales, Xiecheng 800 bales, and Tonghe 1,150 bales. The highest and lowest prices for half a day are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market is stable because although the news about American cotton is bad, the decline is still peaceful, so people's confidence is turning from danger to safety. However, most people believe that the weather is good, and the cotton harvest is bountiful, and the new cotton sales are higher than the October tendered cotton, so the pressure is still heavy. Old cotton is experiencing stronger price increases due to short covering.</p>
<p>Scattered Investors Slightly Offset Tendered Cotton Positions</p>
<p>The price of tendered cotton opened lower in the pre-market trading session. Although the estimate from American cotton telegrams was beneficial to short positions, the degree of price decline was not as strong as expected the previous day. People's confidence in the market was slightly calm, and scattered investors actively offset their positions. At the same time, Osaka Sanpin cotton also rebounded by three, four, and five jiao. However, the decline in Indian cotton was severe, and prices fell back again in the second round of trading. By the third closing, it was heard that the yarn market was good, and it was said that American cotton might rebound tomorrow, so people's confidence improved again. As a result, the prices for all months rose by two, three, and jiao to three and a half jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day, except for August, which rose by six jiao. It was found that Dafeng sold 1,400 dan, Yuanda 1,200 dan, Yixing 6,000 dan, Shenji 1,300 dan, Changfeng 6,000 dan, Runkang 4,200 dan, Xincheng 1,000 dan, Changhe 5,200 dan, and Chengji 6,300 dan.

<p>(1) The prices of wheat, peanuts, sesame, etc., published in the newspaper are all in units of 100 market catties and are calculated inclusive of the bag.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the market prices of various goods, such as wheat, which is currently in the new crop season, there are daily market prices. Peanuts, sesame, etc., are sometimes available and sometimes not. Market price increases and decreases are based purely on whether buying and selling can come close and what the inventory is like. There are no specialized publications for these goods. If you want to understand, you can refer to the commercial section of this newspaper, which is published daily.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the issue of selling goods, all wheat and other goods shipped to Shanghai must be entrusted to miscellaneous grain merchants for resale. Their handling commission is 1% of the total price of the goods. As for the Flour Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Association, they are places for gatherings of the respective industries and do not accept consignment sales in principle. Even flour factories, apart from self-operation, distant customer goods are handled by miscellaneous grain merchants, and there are no direct transactions. In general, entrusting merchants to sell goods can be pre-designated, or sold upon arrival of the goods, or sold at a limited price. The merchants will follow the customer's intentions. This method of entrustment can be done by letter or telegram. Therefore, once a merchant is entrusted, problems such as unfamiliarity with the area and difficulty in promoting sales are readily solved.</p>
<p>(4) One market catty is equal to half a kilogram.</p>
<p>(5) After the arrival of through transport goods, they are naturally stored in the railway warehouse. Warehouse rent is collected after five days. However, the railway warehouse is slightly larger than the bank's storage area. Merchants who accept entrustment can arrange for transshipment. As for freight, it can be paid at the delivery station or at the arrival station. Bank warehouse fees are four cents per bag per month. If it is less than one month, it is also calculated as one month.</p>
<p>(6) There are currently no taxes on wheat, peanuts, sesame, etc.</p>
<p>(7) For freight, if the railway through transport is used, there should be rules at the delivery station that can be inquired about nearby. If you entrust a transfer company to transport, from a practical point of view, it will be slightly higher than railway through transport. This can be discussed and compared with the local railway or transfer company.</p>
<p>(8) Shipping losses are unavoidable. If you entrust through transport, it is relatively less troublesome and leakage may be slightly less.</p>
<p>(9) Unloading fees After the goods arrive in Shanghai, unloading the car and entering the warehouse costs two jiao per ton. The same applies when leaving the warehouse.</p>
<p>(10) For bulk transportation, regardless of the quantity, the railway has regulations and there are no preferential treatments. A full carload is 40 tons, and other tons can also be consigned, but it is more difficult to consolidate cars.</p>
<p>(10) (1) Transportation and sales, of course, various goods can be transported and sold to various places, but you still need to entrust local merchants. For example, after the goods arrive in Shanghai, there must be a merchant to receive the bill of lading before they can be sold. For goods from afar, you can pledge at a local bank, between 60% and 70% of the market price of the goods. The remaining payment will be remitted by the handling merchant after the goods are sold. In addition to receiving a 1% commission, the handling merchant is also responsible for overdue warehouse rent, loading and unloading fees, transfer fees, insurance fees, sales weighing fees, and pledge interest remittance fees, telegraphic fees.</p>
<p>(10) (2) Loading time: After various goods are shipped by the starting station, if there are no special circumstances, there should be a scheduled arrival time. It takes about four or five days to load from your place to Shanghai. However, it is difficult to predetermine whether the goods can get a freight car immediately at the starting station.</p>
<p>(10) (3) As for the trend of market prices, the so-called morning and evening are different and it is difficult to predict, because the various items listed are related to international trade. You can check the daily commercial information in this newspaper, and you will be able to infer from one thing to another. If you want to know the exact market price of the item, you may wish to send a sample to this newspaper, and we will be happy to introduce someone in the industry to clarify the real situation, so that you know the difference between good quality and ordinary, and you cannot purely use market prices as a standard.</p>

<p>Sour plum soup is like people competing for face, superficially well-dressed, but in fact, it is full of holes inside. That sour and sweet taste is just like the sour plum soup of the old capital of Beiping!</p>
<p>When a round watermelon is divided, I think of the future re-division of the world's colonies, isn't it the same?</p>
<p>People fanning fans give off a graceful air, just like a benefactor in the summer, but once it gets cool, they have to retire!</p>
<p>Ice cream, Hōlan water, shaved ice are like heroes of an era, who are forgotten once they lose power. Peaches are like women with different styles, graceful in demeanor. Lotus leaves and lotus flowers stand gracefully in the center of the water in summer. Looking at them, it's like taking a refreshing medicine, like a refined scholar, free and easy, making people eliminate all worldly worries!</p>
<h3 id="e197">Tight Lotus Breeze, Cool Moon Rising <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Lake Beggar</p>
<p>The coolness of West Lake in June is only in the deep night. During the day, the water vapor rises, causing stifling heat that does not dissipate. Those floating waves licking the shore are all due to the hot wind. The furnace pants for breath, and the palm-leaf fan is useless. Only those who have lived here for a long time can understand this suffering. The lake is a lotus root swamp, red smiling and white weeping, most beautiful in midsummer, but confined by the scorching sun, it is pitiful to see it wilt in the middle of the day. Therefore, I once wrote in a miscellaneous poem: "Ten thousand trees suffer from heat and cry, a wisp of fragrance sustains the lake and mountain's life." Towards evening, fireflies glow red, and there is a slight coolness in the Wushan area. But the wind on the lake still makes people feel sick in bursts, so living in a floating boat, you must wait for the dew to nourish the grass and the midnight bell to ring clearly in the forest. Because the dew is heavy, the residual heat lingers, and the moon rises and the hidden heat dissipates. At that time, the chaotic mountains stretch their heads, the wind blowing through the trees sends coolness, and ten thousand lotus flowers straighten their backs, sharing fragrance and shaking green. It feels as if the surrounding clouds and water all understand human intentions. The lake is clear and fertile, as transparent as a琉璃瓶 (glass bottle?), with red and white flowers growing in a chaotic mix, like a natural masterpiece of 清供 (pure offering?). Besides the solitary guest, there are also those who bring their families and whisper among the翠盖 (green canopies), looking like nothing less than immortals. "Clouds embrace, quiet and without a sound, it is the night to raft on the Silver River. Thirty-six mandarin ducks under the moon, fragrant saliva falling into the water activates the lotus flowers." I am used to drifting and have erased my delusions. But carefully appreciating the pure plants, I suddenly feel a sense of sorrow: I have always said that the lotus is the gentleman of flowers, and it can also be compared to a short-lived talent. The appearance is beautiful, and the heart is full of bitterness. It blooms and withers in a summer, who is it for? Thinking of the ignorance of things, it moves my sadness even more. The wind is tight on the萍末 (duckweed ends?), and the accumulated dew falls like tears. Taking advantage of the sparse stars hanging the oars, the 葛薄 (thin kudzu cloth?) seems unable to withstand the cold.</p>
<h3 id="e198">White Hair <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>After discovering a single white hair for the first time, I want to lament that the days are numbered and feel that I am getting old and dying, although I am not yet thirty years old, but the past years are like a dream in an instant.</p>
<p>Running around and shouting all day long, jumping like a dog, calling like a cat, thinking, depressed, calculating for a family's food, clothing, and shelter, white hairs will grow out one by one without end. Those who have tea in hand, food in mouth, embracing charming wives and concubines, without a thought in their heads, and no scheming, the white hairs do not dare to show themselves at all. It not only teases people, but also is very snobbish.</p>
<p>There are famous white hairs in history, one is Wu Zixu from the Li State period, who was so anxious after stealing through Zhaoguan overnight that his beard and hair turned white, and the other is Wang Lang, from the Three Kingdoms period, who was scolded to death by Zhuge Liang for being a "old thief with gray beard and an old man with white hair!" The former, because of his white hair, later established many great undertakings, avenged his father and brothers, and created the temporary strength of the Wu State, while the latter could not bear the scolding of white hair and sacrificed his life alive.</p>
<p>The transformation of hair into white and the role of nerves are indeed very related. After Louis XVI's queen received the death sentence, she was so depressed that her golden hair turned white by the next day. This is a famous historical fact. Also, in a certain place in Germany, a woman had her hair and eyebrows turn white because of excessive panic when a house collapsed. So, Wu Zixu's hair turning white overnight does not seem to be entirely unfounded.</p>
<p>Qing Dynasty, Qian Muzhai married Liu Rushi, one with grizzled white hair and the other with a bright red face, quite like an old cow eating young grass, but the two were very fond of each other. One day, Muzhai stared at Rushi, and Rushi asked, "Why do you love me?" He said, "I love your black hair and white face, so why do you love me?" Rushi said, "I love your white hair and black face." Unexpectedly, white hair, after thousands of years, actually got a confidante of a generation of beauties, and did not do little to give voice to the white hair.</p>

<p>Menglan said: Why do you always say half sentences? Xiaoju said: It's just that someone from the Liu family came to discuss... As she spoke, she smiled slightly at Menglan. Hearing these words, his face immediately turned purple. He pressed his hands on his thighs, lowered his head, and said nothing. Xiaoju said: I said you couldn't tell you, right? If I told you, you would be angry. Menglan was still silent, just sitting like that. Xiaoju was also stunned, not knowing how to comfort him. Just as she was hesitating, she heard someone downstairs calling, "Xiaoju, you thing, where did you run off to again?" Xiaoju stuck out her tongue at Menglan, turned around and ran away. Menglan sat on the edge of the bed with his head down, not knowing for how long. Later, the old nanny came upstairs and asked him to go downstairs to eat, asking, "Miss, there is a letter on the table, did you see it?" He suddenly realized, went forward and took the letter, put it in his pocket, and answered lightly, pretending to be nonchalant: This is an old letter, which was found on the bookshelf, it doesn't matter. You say I won't go downstairs, I want to do my homework, make a bowl of rice with boiling water and bring it up to eat. No vegetables are needed, just cut a piece of大头菜 (mustard tuber?) to eat. In ordinary times, the old nanny would definitely have dragged him downstairs. Today, he didn't say anything and went downstairs as instructed. Menglan quickly sent the letter to the second box and locked the box. After locking it, he even pressed a small box on top of it. Then he found a letter in the drawer, the same style as Zhang Guoqi's letter, and threw it on the table, leaning his head diagonally on the table, towards a small mirror by the window. For some reason, the poem wishing to be a mirror came to his mind again. He just pondered. Later, the maid brought the food, and he only ate a little bit. Of course, that night added to his endless worries. He was thinking on the bed, now that this letter has been sent, Guoqi's hopes will inevitably take another step forward. When he goes to school tomorrow, should he smile at him? Should he politely salute him? Should he ignore him? After thinking about these three methods for a week, he felt that they were all wrong. Only from tomorrow on, will he open another path to school, and temporarily avoid meeting him. After thinking about it all night, he felt that this method was appropriate. Because they don't see each other, there is no need to manage the attitude of whether or not to ignore. The next day, after washing up upstairs, he carried his schoolbag downstairs, intending to go to school. Unexpectedly, when he walked into the main room of the main building, he received a very heavy shock. (60)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Notes on What I Saw <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— (Meng Zhao)</p>
<p>One day, I went to visit Mr. Qian Weijun, the inventor of economic lighting, and met many Japanese elementary school students on the route 8 tram, who were lively and strong, and each had a martial spirit! What was particularly commendable was that each person had a volume in hand, reciting diligently. I caught sight of one of the elementary school students sitting next to me, who was constantly studying a volume, which was our Chinese geography lecture notes, what the Yellow River basin of North China, what the terrain is like, what the abundant products are, the coal mines of Shanxi Province, the cotton of Shaanxi Province... the iron and antimony of Hunan Province... as well as the Yangtze River basin, the Pearl River basin, etc... He read while comparing the map, with great interest! It was as if he was taking something out of a bag! China is going to belong to them! What a shock that their young minds are absorbing impressions of our Chinese resources! Our elementary school students, after reading literature, what do they think? And those college students who only know how to pursue the opposite sex and talk about love, after reading literature! I don't know what they think even more?</p>
<h3 id="e201">A Badge of Shame <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhenru</p>
<p>This year's summer, following the shifts between storms and strong sunlight, alternates between coolness and heat. This symbolizes the warmth and coldness of human emotions, offering young people entering society for the first time a most obvious lesson.</p>
<p>In the past couple of days, the mercury in thermometers has been rising again, soon approaching one hundred degrees. Consequently, the number of bare-chested people has also increased. Although going shirtless is a bad habit of our people, the discomfort of laborers when they get hot is just as unbearable as a wealthy person urgently needing to relieve themselves but being denied access to a toilet.</p>
<p>Liyang is located at the center of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway. The administrative authorities are vigorously promoting the New Life Movement. Naturally, going shirtless must be prohibited. Persuasion might not be effective, and punishment seems too harsh. Therefore, they adopted a stamping method. Police officers, carrying ink and a "Shame" stamp, patrol the streets. When they encounter shirtless individuals, they stamp the words "Shame" on their skin. This is carried out swiftly and decisively, and the display of semi-naked bodies has decreased somewhat. However, some bewildered villagers perceive this as an insult and have started conflicts. At the same time, stores selling Guang-style goods reported a shortage of undershirts and tank tops.</p>
<p>Someone jokingly said that stamping the "Shame" mark on shirtless people is somewhat similar to tax collectors stamping "Inspected" on pork. However, laborers, torn between caring for their shame and needing to eat, have no choice but to save money on food and spend it on clothing, buying a tank top to wear, which ends up soaked in sweat all day long, with no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>Police officers, while chasing shirtless individuals to stamp them, overheard the sound of mahjong tiles from a rice shop upstairs and unintentionally caught gamblers. This is another amusing incident caused by the stamping campaign. It shows that some of our people still have leisure time and know how to enjoy themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Ping Pong Opera in Shanghai <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The birthplace of Ping Pong Opera is in Rehe, but its popularity lies in Shenyang. Therefore, the melodies of Ping Pong Opera are most pleasing to the taste of people from outside the Great Wall. The Ping Pong Opera venues in Shenyang are always packed with listeners every day.</p>
<p>Since Zhang Zuolin entered the customs, the Feng army has been stationed all over Pingjin. To cater to the Communists, Pingjin has Ping Pong Opera theaters. In the past, Ping Pong Opera was very simple. Except for the lead actress, there were not as many supporting roles as there are now. After invading Pingjin, it gradually improved. The plays performed also became complete stories, roughly forming a scale.</p>
<p>The southward invasion of the Ping Pong Opera force came to Shanghai. The first was the Zhu Baoxia and Zhuxia sisters, performing at the New World Hotel. It was also because of the exquisite skills of Baoxia and Zhuxia that they received praise from people in Shanghai. Ping Pong Opera in Shanghai has a superior position like today, so the Zhu sisters are the only heroes to promote Ping Pong Opera to Shanghai.</p>
<p>After Zhu Baoxia left, the Ping Pong female actors who came to Shanghai were Furonghua, Ailianjun, Bai Yushuang, Zhang Cailan, Yu Lingzhi, and Xicaiyun, who came to Shanghai recently. Although each person’s acting skills are commendable, compared with the color and skills of Zhu Baoxia, it always feels that there is a difference between a small witch and a big witch. This is a sign that Zhu's talent and skills are better than others.</p>
<p>Now, the power of Ping Pong Opera has almost filled Shanghai. No major amusement park does not regard Ping Pong Opera as a pioneer to attract tourists. The Great World occupies the top spot, sparing no expense, and hired the Zhu Baoxia Zhuxia sisters. Xianshi Amusement Park, Yu Lingzhi, Zhang Cailan, and Bai Yushuang also said that they will come again in the autumn. Recently, Xicailian has come to Shanghai and auditioned on the Tianchan Stage. There is no doubt that the Ping Pong teams in Shanghai have surpassed Pingjin. Among these Ping Pong female corners, their acting skills, except for Xicailian, have been seen by Shanghainese, and the following comments can be obtained.</p>
<p>The plays performed by Bai Yushuang are only of the kind of Ma Widow's Shop, Indecent Mirror, Pan Jinlian, and Yan Xijiao. The rest of the actors are not first-class talents among the Ping Pong female actors. The most satisfying one is naturally Zhu Shixia. Her expressions, singing skills, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are all excellent. Sometimes when performing lewd plays, she can also be happy without being obscene, and the implications are endless. Therefore, Zhu has fascinated many audiences in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Xicailian, who is coming now, has not seen her color and skills by Shanghainese. It is said that she is very qualified, and her age is only second to Bai Yushuang, and the older one is between twenty-seven and eight. Her husband, named Li Xiaofang, sings on the same stage and never leaves. If the Tianchan trial performance has the power to call, it may be possible to enter the Dasing Amusement Park.</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<h3 id="e203">Japanese Children's Toys <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Toys are children's treasures, and no child dislikes them. Japan's toy industry has already occupied the first place in the world. Eighty to ninety percent of the toys purchased by children in our country are Japanese goods. The Japanese themselves also say that no matter how much countries around the world increase tariff barriers or exclude Japanese goods, innocent children only know that they are fun and have no economic or political effect. The reason why Japanese toys can be popular around the world is that their toys can grasp the psychology of children. Now, the most popular Japanese toys are militarized things, which is also due to the environment. Airplanes, tanks, and guns, imperceptibly make children's psychology gradually have a tendency to like war, and only know how to obey and believe in the Emperor of the Motherland. Most of these toys are made of tinplate, which is very similar to the real thing, and is rotated by springs. Tanks and guns are equipped with calcium carbide, which can emit light and sound. Although the wooden ones cannot move, they are not easily damaged and are cheaper. Our country often wants to imitate Japanese toys, and Japan also imitates our country's toys such as bamboo dragons and sound-producing cicadas, and then transports them to the South Pacific Islands.</p>
<p>Celluloid dolls and rattles are toys for three- or four-year-old babies, and not as popular as tinplate toys that can make sounds and move automatically. Rubber-made cattle and horses are gradually decreasing in sales, and our country can also manufacture them. The value of toys exceeding one yuan is not very suitable. Things that cost a dime or two, on the other hand, can be popular everywhere. The toys made in our country are large in price, and the types of products are small, and it is still difficult to compete with Japanese goods. All parts of Japan have local toys, using shells and conch shells to make stationery toys, which has also become a sideline.</p>
<p>Japanese children can have many cheap picture books, which are all materials of militarism. Such as the stories of the Russo-Japanese War and the Sino-Japanese War, as well as ideal pictures of future wars. Therefore, Japanese children's loyalty to the emperor and patriotism does not fall behind adults. These kinds of pictorials already have Chinese explanations and will be promoted in the three eastern provinces and North China. Another kind is attached with the native language of the South Pacific, which is specially sold in the area of the South Pacific Islands. Parents who care for children should pay attention to the implications of toys when purchasing toys, and it is appropriate to contain educational significance. On the one hand, I hope that toy companies will manufacture toys that meet our current needs, and do not specialize in blind imitation to satisfy themselves.</p>

<p>— (Jiang Gong)</p>
<p>The famous national doctor Feng Shanyi is from a famous family in Siming. He studied Qihuang in his youth and was proficient in treating men, women, children, typhoid fever, fright diseases, menstrual irregularities in women, infertility after marriage for many years, and all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. He can always bring back the spring and respond like a god. He set up a clinic in Shanghai and his reputation has long been established. He has long been known to all walks of life. Recently, I learned that Dr. Feng cured Mrs. Jiang in West Shanghai, who suffered from severe blood collapse and was in critical condition. Dr. Feng was invited to diagnose and treat her, and after only a few doses of medicine, the disease was suddenly cured. There is also Mr. Xian, who lives on Yalv Road in Hongkou and suffers from damp fever, and Miss Xue in Nanshi who married many times but has never been pregnant, and suffers from menstrual disorders and has a pale complexion, and has sought treatment from famous doctors to no avail. She was very anxious, and also after Dr. Feng's careful diagnosis and treatment, her dysmenorrhea was also cured and did not recur, and her menstruation was also regulated. In just a few months, she became pregnant. The whole family was extremely happy. They praised Dr. Feng endlessly. Over the years, he has cured countless diseases. A few are listed to inform the patients. It is true that Dr. Feng is not inferior to Hua Tuo's Changshi. Dr. Feng is not a good minister and is willing to be a good doctor. His principle is to save the world with medical skills. Regardless of the rich or the poor, those who seek diagnosis from Dr. Feng are treated equally. He examines the symptoms in detail and carefully. Even the general poor who cannot afford medical treatment and medicine, Dr. Feng often takes out his own money to provide diagnosis and medicine, and there is never a complaint. He has been responding to consultations and giving medicine to the poor and needy for thousands of years. Those who have benefited from him all praised him and praised him. His morality, treatment of others, and amiability can be imagined. He is truly a good doctor in the world. I have a deep friendship with Dr. Feng and know the details. Now Dr. Feng's original clinic is not enough. It is specially relocated to Building 3, Yuyangli, Bai'erbu Road, Xiahfei Road, French Concession, and will be moved in and start consultations on the 18th of the month. (Route) The French Concession Lines 2, 4, 7, and 10 trams get off at Luban Road and walk a few steps west to the corner. The phone number of the institute is 81373. The daily consultation time is from 9 am to 4 pm. The consultation fee for outpatients is one yuan and two jiao. The consultation fee for house calls is four yuan and four jiao. House calls after 4 pm. Please register before the time to avoid hugging each other. The number is doubled. The route is discussed separately. Consultations are held as usual on Sundays. If you are really poor and unable to afford medical treatment and medicine and have proof documents. Diagnosis and medication can be sent completely free of charge. If schools, groups, and factories are entrusted to introduce them to seek medical treatment. A preferential treatment method is given. Charged at half price. I hope you pay attention to it. I will specially write a few words to introduce it. So that patients in the world can ask about it.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Chen Jitang's Taboo Number Thirteen <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>After Chen Jitang stepped down, he originally lived at No. 13 Mai Chang Nu Road. Chen believed that Western customs tabooed the number 13, so at 3 pm on the 8th, he moved to the Buddhist Association in Li Garden with Chen Weizhou, Mo Xiuying, and others. In fact, Chen was originally unlucky, so he went to live at No. 13 Mai Chang Nu Road. It was not because he lived at No. 13 that he was unlucky. Therefore, what relationship does the number 13 or 14 have with the luck or misfortune of personnel matters?</p>
<p>The unlucky number of thirteen also has this saying in our country. The thirteenth and twenty-first days of the first month are Yang Gong's taboo days. If a son is born on this day, he will definitely beg for food. This is the unlucky number of thirteen. The patterns of tortoise shells also have thirteen sections, so people often use thirteen pieces as a source of ridicule. In fact, the spirit turtle has existed for a thousand years, why is it an evil thing? Even if it is born on the thirteenth day of the first month, and the result is not begging for food, this is everywhere. There are more people who are not born on the thirteenth day of the first month, but specialize in begging for food as a way of life. The depth of our people's superstition can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Therefore, Chen Jitang's misfortune has nothing to do with No. 13. Chen Jitang's first major misfortune was that he did not accept the orders of the central government and became a separatist situation. The second major misfortune was that he plundered the people's wealth and made all of it his personal property. The third major misfortune was that he imposed exorbitant taxes and cruelly treated our people. The fourth major misfortune was that he listened to rumors and was arrogant. Chen Jitang's misfortune lies in the above four things, what does it have to do with No. 13?</p>
<p>The most ridiculous thing is that Chen, as a Chinese person, believes in Western superstition, which is even more foolish. Assuming that Indian and South Pacific customs include bowing to crows and kneeling to long snakes, will Chen follow their customs? There are more houses with the number 13 in this city than anywhere else. There are 13 roads and 13 alleys. I have never heard of a house with the number 13 being uninhabited, nor have I heard of anything unlucky after living there.</p>
<p>In short, Chen Jitang's downfall this time was due to superstition. After the downfall, the idea of superstition has not been eliminated, and it is still superstition. Chen is really a man who does not wake up until his death. And the next day's telegram said that Chen Jitang had taken a foreign ship to go abroad, then the saying that No. 13 is unlucky was originally a false name, just to take this opportunity to slip away. However, Chen was originally a cunning old fox, and he deceived the eyes of the world a lot.</p>
<h3 id="e206">A Visit to the Puyi Vocational Training Institute (Part 2) <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Zhou</p>
<p>Apprentices in the institute cannot request to leave the institute without a reason, nor can they leave the institute a step without permission. If they want to go to the back to urinate or defecate, they must also obtain a certificate before being allowed to go out. However, if they are sick, they are also allowed to take leave and be taken back by their family members for treatment. Apprentices who are sick are sent to the hospital if they are seriously ill, and if they are nearby, they are asked to seek medical treatment in the institute and notify their family members.</p>
<p>The procedure for entering the institute is extremely simple. As long as they are poor children between the ages of twelve and sixteen, they can request to enter the institute, but they must be really poor and able to find a substantial guarantor in this city to be qualified. However, the institute has a fixed quota, and when the quota is full, the institute can reject the request.</p>
<p>The administrator, Mr. Xing, talked with me for a long time in the reception room. I looked up and saw a portrait of Mr. Shi Liangcai on the wall. After Mr. Shi passed away, a sum of money was transferred to the institute.</p>
<p>After the class bell in the workshop rang, Mr. Xing accompanied me to visit each department for a week. The first is the metalworking department, which is a manufacturing plant for machine parts and materials. There are dozens of motors there, and each motor has three or four apprentices working next to it. In addition, there is also a technician and several teaching assistants to guide and teach. The second is the electrical materials department, which produces lead money feet, round wood, and box boards. The third is the clay sculpture department. There are more than a dozen apprentices carving various clay figures in the models; some are making hand-mounted feet, some are opening their faces and drawing eyebrows, some are applying powder and oil, and some are adding beards and matching clothes. Everyone is working together. It is said that the mud they use is also shipped from Wuxi. The fourth is the bamboo ware department, and the products here are various bamboo wares of different thicknesses. The fifth is the rattan ware department. In addition to rattan beds and rattan chairs, there are also modern rattan appliances. The sixth is the sewing department, which specializes in making clothes for the apprentices in the institute and small clothes for the clay figures. The seventh is the mounting department, which specializes in mounting paintings and other works. The eighth is the Western music department, which is in a room upstairs and studies for only two hours a day.</p>
<p>The classrooms for Chinese, arithmetic, and bookkeeping are upstairs. Their highest grade is the sixth grade, but the level is uneven, because some of the apprentices who enter the institute already have high school levels, while others are illiterate. The teachers in the institute can only take on some ordinary courses.</p>
<p>After visiting these places, Mr. Xing led me to visit the dining room, bedroom, and storage room.</p>
<p>The bedroom is upstairs, and it is a large floor with one hundred and forty single iron beds arranged. The air and light are very sufficient. A small room outside is for people with infectious diseases to live in. Further forward is the bedroom for the staff. Next to the classroom is the storage room, which is full of clothes for the apprentices.</p>
<p>The dining room is in the back; this dining room is very large, and it is enough to accommodate more than a hundred people eating at the same time. Next to it is a tiger stove.</p>
<p>The air in the whole institute is very good. The open spaces everywhere are full of flowers and trees, especially on several wisteria frames, which are covered with green grapes, which is very cute.</p>
<p>When I left, I asked Mr. Xing for a copy of the institute's charter.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Apprentice Xiaowei <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Rui Fa</p>
<p>"You little devil, you are not careful when doing things, can you eat? If you get burned to death, no one will care. You little pig..."</p>
<p>Xiaowei, an apprentice at a carpenter's shop, had just finished cooking lunch. He took a water ladle to the tiger stove to make boiling water for the boss's rice. The water in the ladle was just boiled, and a stream of hot air rushed up from the lid. Xiaowei was not careful and put his hand a little bit, and the water ladle fell off the table. The hot pot of water just poured on his left foot, which aroused the boss's anger. He glared fiercely and started scolding. If he hadn't been holding a bowl of rice in his hand and eating, he might have slapped him. At this time, Xiaowei had to endure the pain, picked up the water ladle with red, round eyes and went to the tiger stove again.</p>
<p>Xiaowei's feet, which had frostbite in winter and scabies in summer, were poured on by such a pot of boiling water, and blisters immediately floated up. Although he secretly applied a little bit of lard in the afternoon when the boss went out to work, the lard seemed to have lost its effect in this hot weather. The blisters broke one by one, and the five little toes were swollen like pig tails. An unbearable pain went straight from the soles of his feet to his head, but he could only endure it, his small eyes filled with tears, and he dared not say a word. He still worked as usual until eleven o'clock in the evening before climbing to the reading room and lying down.</p>
<p>"Does it hurt? Xiaowei. Go get some medicine to apply tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>The boss does not live in the shop at night. There are only Xiaowei and another apprentice, Ah Hui, who has completed his apprenticeship, in the shop. He saw Xiaowei lying on the floor crying softly like that, and sympathetically comforted him.</p>
<p>Xiaowei is only fourteen years old this year, and he has been an apprentice in this carpenter's shop for two years. When he first came to be an apprentice, Xiaowei's mother asked someone to intercede with the boss. Although being an apprentice will not have a good future, Xiaowei's mother still sees it as a good job. As long as the child suffers for a few more years, he can become a carpenter and earn money to support the family. Xiaowei was also happy, being an apprentice is always better than following his mother and starving.</p>
<p>Xiaowei came here to be an apprentice. Every day he cooks, sweeps the floor, opens and closes the shop door, buys things... Those jobs were originally done by Ah Hui. As soon as Xiaowei came, everything was passed on to him. For two years, he only watched the boss and the carpenter master doing work, but no one ever taught him how to learn this craft.</p>
<p>"To make a child good, you have to let him suffer more," this is the golden rule for bosses teaching apprentices, which is also the so-called philosophy of life of "enduring hardship to become a superior person." Xiaowei came to the carpenter's shop and went through two years of training, turning a fourteen-year-old child into a skinny monkey. The shadows of laughter and crying have disappeared from that small face, and it is always that blank expression.</p>
<p>With such two years of experience and lessons, he naturally knows how to endure being scalded on a foot like this. He got up early the next morning to work again. The foot was more swollen than yesterday, and pus was flowing, but he had to let the pain go on its own. The work will not be reduced because of this. At the same time, he has to pretend that he is not in pain in front of the boss, so as not to get another scolding from the boss. The masters asked him how his foot was? He only replied: "It's okay," but the voice of that answer was a little trembling.</p>
<h3 id="e208">That Night <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuo Er</p>
<p>After finishing rehearsing a play for some children in a night school, it was almost eleven o'clock. Although I was tired and sleepy, I didn't feel anything because I was walking and talking with them. Later, they gradually smiled and said "See you tomorrow" and turned to other roads and disappeared. At that time, I really had a kind of unspeakable feeling in my heart, lonely, lonely, like an old man in his later years abandoned by happiness. I resolutely wanted to say: Can't you walk with me for a while longer? - Just a little bit, or walk a few more steps with me! But they were all smiling brightly on their faces, resolutely turning their bodies...I was tired.</p>
<p>Let's go, let's go by myself!</p>
<p>The asphalt road stretched quietly to the distant front, disappearing into the darkness. There was no commotion on the wide street, and it was as quiet as a piece of iron, and I didn't think about anything, even how to walk. Just two shoulders carrying a heavy head, walking inexplicably. Turning every street that I was familiar with, they were all wearing a cold face, as if saying: Get out! This world doesn't belong to you</p>
<p>What does this have to do with me? I smiled slightly.</p>
<p>I walked onto a gravel road, which was a road leading directly to the alley I passed through. It pricked my feet, and every time I resolutely regarded it as a kind of torture inflicted on me. The sidewalks on both sides of the road had long been occupied by the hardworking brothers as happy sleeping beds.</p>
<p>The closer I got to home, the more distant the road felt, and the fatigue doubled. When I got to the door, I actually felt that sleeping on the ground would be more comfortable than going upstairs and falling in the pavilion room.</p>
<p>I slowly and gently walked into the door.</p>
<p>I am glad that I did not see it wrong, there was indeed a stranger shrinking there at the entrance of the stairs "Who are you?..." I asked the man weakly, and he did not answer. At this time, I felt a bit of fear. When I realized that I did have the strength to deal with a person, I felt at ease "What are you doing?" I asked loudly, and at the same time I turned on the light</p>
<p>The man stood up slowly. He was a thin old man with gray hair and a beard, pale face, hunched over, and the arms exposed in his tattered clothes were so thin and trembling violently. He opened his mouth, but he couldn't say a word because of excessive panic</p>
<p>"Who are you looking for?"</p>
<p>"Boss...boss" the old man said in a trembling voice as he bowed, "I'm not a bad person,...I came here to find someone with the surname Liu,...I don't know he moved, I..." He almost knelt down. As he spoke, he lifted his clothes to show that he had not stolen anything</p>
<p>I knew what kind of good person he was, and I hated his despicable appearance even more. I didn't feel sorry for him at all. I was silent for a while, and ordered him in a cold voice: Get out, as long as you dare to come again..." He quickly slipped out, and I heard him running away in the alley with a thud.</p>
<p>Walking up the stairs, I saw at a glance that my door was open. I went in to check. A set of clothes and five dimes placed on the desk were gone. The window facing the street that I had closed was already opened.</p>
<p>I hurried downstairs, passed through the alley, what else was there besides dead silence?</p>

<h3 id="e209">In the Temple of the Mountain Gorge <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>—Miscellaneous Mountain Writings, No. 2</p>
<p>We rushed from Xingwen County to the foot of the southern side of Dalong Mountain, and it was already dusk. On a narrow path, we watched from afar as the setting sun reflected its last rays of the day on the peaks of Dalong Mountain. We were all anxious, unsure of where we would spend the night.</p>
<p>Finally, we found lodging in a mountain gorge, a dilapidated monk's temple. From the outside, it looked small, but stepping through the temple's gate shocked us. The emptiness, height, and darkness made our hair stand on end. A Buddha with a blue face and fangs, more than ten feet tall, stared at us with a pair of terrifying, fierce eyes. The four of us standing before him seemed so insignificant! Looking up, we couldn't see the roof beams. The walls were blackened by years of incense smoke. There was no one in the main hall. We looked around, east and west, and no one could say a word.</p>
<p>After a while, a bald little monk came out from behind the main hall, looking at us with surprise and trepidation. After we told him our purpose, he led us to a room in the back courtyard. This courtyard was even more gloomy and terrifying than the main hall. In several rooms, there were large, black coffins. Looking through the small windows covered with cobwebs, each coffin had a vegetable oil lamp with a terrifying flame flickering in front of it.</p>
<p>The little monk brought us a pot of tea and a kerosene lamp and then left. We heard him close the door of the front room with a 'snap', leaving us alone in this large courtyard. At this moment, we couldn't help but feel frightened. It was our first time staying overnight in this ancient temple in the remote mountains and wilderness. We almost suspected that we had entered a demon's lair or a bandit zone. We sat under the dim kerosene lamp, afraid to go to bed. Old Li, the oldest and strongest among us, held a double-barreled shotgun, aiming it at the door, ready to fire if anything seemed amiss. The other two and I each tightly held a small bread knife.</p>
<p>Outside, a gust of wind occasionally swept through, rustling the leaves of the trees. The large courtyard was enveloped in an atmosphere of gloom and terror. From the mountain gorge, we sometimes heard frightening cries. One of us reminded us: "Listen, that's the sound of a tiger in the mountain gorge!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, we became even more frightened. The night was not yet deep, and the dim moonlight outside the window was just reaching the treetops. I wondered how we would get through this long, sorrowful night! Moreover, we had to travel tomorrow. Without sleep, we would be in poor spirits when climbing over the mountains early in the morning. So Old Li suggested: "Why don't we knock on the front door and ask the little monk to find us a room to stay in the front? We can give him some extra incense money tomorrow. Otherwise, sleeping in the main hall would be fine!"</p>
<p>We knocked on the door for more than half an hour before there was any movement inside the room. The little monk asked in a trembling voice: "Sirs, sirs, what do you want?"</p>
<p>After we told him why we were knocking, the little monk insisted: "Sirs, please forgive us, forgive us. Guests are not allowed to stay in the front rooms. He was almost too anxious to speak: "Our abbot has gone to Nanchang to solicit donations. He instructed us this way when he left."</p>
<p>We stopped knocking and pleaded with him in a gentle voice, telling him that we were good people.</p>
<p>"Sirs, sirs, I know you are good people," he said, a little bolder now. "A month ago, three guests robbed our temple clean. Our abbot was injured in the arm. This time, the abbot went to Nanchang both to solicit donations and to have his injury treated." His voice was close to tears: "Sirs, we really can't allow guests to stay in the front rooms. Please forgive us, forgive us."</p>
<p>Having no choice, we returned to the room in the large courtyard. We faintly heard the little monk adding another bolt to the star gate in the front.</p>

<p>But hear the sound of the drum on the building. Hong Niang moves out of the room. She wanders under the moon and in front of the flowers. She sees a little zither boy coming. He grabs her and says, "Sister, please save my Zhang, the young master." Since that day at the West Chamber, his golden body has been invaded by wind. Now he is sick in the study. He spits fresh blood every morning. "Sister, please deliver this letter to your Miss. Is there a wonderful medicine to save my Lord?" Hong Niang listens and becomes furious. She scolds the little zither boy. "Although your master is sick, he should quickly seek treatment and medicine from a doctor. It has nothing to do with my Miss. How can she have a spiritual pill to save your Lord?" "Sister, this illness must be cured by the Miss. I'll go with you to the study to see my master. I guarantee his body will be relaxed immediately."</p>

<h3 id="e214">A Special Feature The Reason Why the Italian-Abyssinian War Film is Delayed (Part 1) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Costing More Than 3.3 Million A Total Failure</p>
<p>Before Abyssinia and Italy started the war, the American film industry was already organizing a film news network. The first footage of the Abyssinian Royal Palace and the Abyssinian Emperor's oath was captured by Loichey of Paramount Pictures. Later, Universal Pictures took the lead, uniting several companies, pooling financial and human resources, and assigning groups to undertake the filming work. All war-related areas, even in the remote mountains and forests, were equipped with cameras. The security was stricter than the front lines of both Abyssinia and Italy. However, from the official declaration of war between the two countries to the ceasefire, several months have passed, and such news has not been shown on screens around the world. What exists, such as Paramount Pictures' "Abyssinian Winds," only introduces Abyssinia's internal customs, the Abyssinian Emperor's meetings, military parades, troop movements, and the private lives of important officials. As for the actual combat between the two countries, it is completely absent. Other film companies, such as 20th Century Fox, also independently organized an Abyssinian expedition by Fox-British News Department. Led by Director of Photography Lan Hameng, only fragments of material from the company's newsreels, such as the departure of Italian troops, boarding ships or land travel, and Mussolini's speeches, or the departure of Abyssinian troops, exist to this day. In short, no company has footage of combat scenes in the Italian-Abyssinian news.</p>
<p>Of course, filming real scenes on the battlefield is extremely dangerous. However, when Universal Pictures organized the Italian-Abyssinian war news photography team, it was prepared for all sacrifices, vowing to show the狰狞 face of war to the movie audience. However, the result was a disgrace to the mission. As for why the photography team spent a huge amount of money and manpower, yet the result was nothing?</p>

<h3 id="e215">"Carnival Night" Should Not Be Underestimated <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>"Carnival Night" has already completely finished filming. It is one of the national films that will be released after the autumn coolness and has attracted much attention. Shi Dongshan said that dozens of beloved colleagues have put in a lot of effort for this film. If this film receives a lot of praise in the future, the credit belongs to everyone. Indeed, "Carnival Night" shows a very serious attitude in its production, and none of the actors and actresses did not take themselves seriously. Everyone almost forgot everything to engage in the work of this film. For example, Gu Eryi plays a county old man of sixty or seventy years old in "Carnival Night", but he himself is a young man of twenty-two years old. Therefore, every time he films, he arrives six hours earlier than others. This makeup, in the hands of makeup director Xin Hanwen, has to be carefully研磨 for six hours before it can be successful. If he films every day, you can imagine the suffering that Gu Eryi has endured on this. However, Gu Eryi is very excited and very happy, and has never complained, because Gu Eryi has forgotten everything for his work. From this example, thinking about the efforts of everyone else for "Carnival Night" is enough to prove that "Carnival Night" is really not a national film that can be underestimated. Now that the release date is approaching, please pay attention to it.</p>

<p>The company allocates funds for compensation Colleagues offer sacrifices and hold funerals</p>
<p>Wu Xinkang, an electrician at the second photography studio of Pengxing Film Company on Ben Erpei Road, accidentally fell from the awning frame while installing red and green lights outside the photography studio on the morning of the 9th, suffering serious injuries. He was immediately rushed to the Guangci Hospital on Father Jin Road for treatment, but eventually died due to his injuries. It is heard that the Star authorities specially convened a meeting to discuss the aftermath, deeply felt that the worker sacrificed himself on duty, and expressed deep condolences.
