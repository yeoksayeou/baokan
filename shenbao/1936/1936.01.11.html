<p>南京　立法院十日會議、通過兩財政要案、原文如次、</p>
<p>一、輔幣條例　　輔幣之鑄造、專屬於中央造幣廠、其發行由中央銀行專司之、　輔幣之種類如左、鎳幣三種、二十分鎳幣、總重六公分、成色純鎳、十分鎳幣、總重四·五公分、成色純鎳、五分鎳幣、總重三公分、成色純鎳、銅幣二種、一分銅幣、總重六·五公分、成色銅九五、錫鋅五、半分銅幣、總重三·五公分、成色銅九五、錫鋅五、　輔幣以十進訐算、其台法幣一元之枚數如左、二十分鎳幣五枚、十分鎳幣十枚、五分鎳幣二十枚、一分銅幣一百枚、半分銅幣二百枚、　輔幣之型式、由財政部擬定、呈經行政院轉呈國民政府造頒布之、　輔幣授受數目、鎳幣每次授受、以合法幣二十元爲限、銅幣每次授受、以合法幣五元爲限、但賦稅之收受及中央銀行之兌換、不適用此種限制、　舊有通用輔幣、由財政部收回銷燬改鑄之、但於規定期限內、仿准各照市價行用、前項辦法及期限、由財政部以命令定之、　輔幣因行使日久、自然磨損、致法定重量减少至百分之五者、得向中央銀行兌換新幣、但係故意毀損或鏨蓋戳記致重量减少形式改變者、卽失其流通效力、不得行使及請求兌換、　僞造輔幣及妨害輔幣信用者、依法懲治、　本條例自公布日施行、</p>
<p>二、偸漏貨物稅處罰法　　本法稱貨物稅者、謂對於貨物依法徵收之國稅、　漏納貨物稅之處罰、除關稅適用海關緝私條例外、均依本法之規定、　漏納貨物稅者、按其情節輕重、科以一倍以上十倍以下之罰鍰、其未遂者、科以三倍以下罰鍰、　漏納貨物稅、其金額在一百元以上、而其情節重大、除依前條科罰鍰外、得併處二年以下有期徒刑·或拘役、　意圖漏納貨物稅、而犯妨害公務罪妨害秩序罪凟職罪殺人罪或傷害罪者、依刑法數罪併罰章之規定處斷、　公務員爲前三條之行爲者、依各該條之規定、加重其處罰至三分之一　公務員包庇他人爲前四條之行爲者、依各該條之規定、加重其處罰至二分之一、　漏納貨物稅之貨物、得沒收之、　依本法規定應科罰鍰者、由徵收機關處分、其應處刑者、應卽移送法院、　關於漏納貨物稅事件之勘騐詢問搜索或扣押、凖用海關緝私條例第一條至第八條之規定、　　私鹽治罪法於本法施行之日廢止之、　　、本法自公布施行、（十日中央社電）</p>
<p>南京　立法院十日會審議偸漏貨物稅處罰法時、各委曾發生激辯、爭論焦點集中標題與廣止私鹽治罪法兩問題、緣中政會擬定該案原則、係以偸漏國稅爲罪名、側重故意、立院財政刑法兩委員會審查結果、將該案標題改爲漏納貨物稅處罰法、一部立委認爲不妥、主將漏納仍復名爲偸漏、結果經主席提付表决、多數主改爲偸漏、至在本案中另設、「私鹽治罪法、於本法施行日廢止之」條文、有認爲不合立法體例者、經馬寅初等激烈反對、謂要求施行新鹽法爲本院一貫主張、私鹽治罪法係專爲保護鹽商利益所訂、與新鹽法抵觸之處甚多、貨物種類甚多、鹽僅其一、果有漏稅事、本法儘可援引處罰、似母庸有此單行法規之存在、結果一致贊成馬議、又審議造幣條例時、黃右昌起立質問、謂新貨幣政策之實施、旣未經立法程序、木案似應俟將實施新貨幣政策案追認後再議、馬寅初起立答稱、此决新貨幣政策之實施、係由中政會授權　融問題緊急委員會所處理、該會委員爲蔣中正·宋子文·孔祥熙·及本院孫院長四人、手續上雖未經立法程序、事實上已由立法當局最高首腦參加、吾人對本案似應體察目前實際環境需要、卽予審議、結果遂一致無異議通過（十日中央社電）</p>
<p>南京　財部發言人談稱、現因市面銅元缺乏、各地需用甚切、及現行輔幣紊亂、易爲奸商操縱、故本部不得不呈請政府、從速制定輔幣條例、以爲鼓鑄新輔幣之張本、在二十二年三月間實行廢兩改元、以爲整理幣制基礎時、因輔幣情形複雜、必須另案規定、故未列入銀本位幣鑄造條例中、數年以來、迭經研究、博採各國新制、並衡酌國民生計情形、本十進原則、妥擬方案、復派遣中央造幣廠鑄造處處長、前往美國費城造幣廠實地監鑄輔幣幣模、以利鑄造、原擬與法幣案同時公佈施行、乃以幣模　鑄需時、未及如期辦竣、現該項幣模業已全數鑄竣、陸續運到、經交由中央造幣廠試行鑄造、成續尚佳、時已正式開鑄、卽將流通市面、（十日中央社電）</p>

<p>— 黃馥</p>
<p>在觀察非常時財政之前，我們不能不先看一看成為這問題中心的所謂軍事費的比率，第一表第二表就表示了日本最近軍事費激增形勢，和世界各帝國主義國家中，日本軍事費的龐大。</p>
<p>（「朝日年鑑」昭和十一年度·頁一五三）</p>
<p>從上面數字，可以知道本年度頂算（閣議通過）軍事費，已經比一九一三年增加了五倍半，而歲入則祇增加了三倍點九，而且，這里所說的軍事費祇限於陸海軍省所管轄的直接費，此外間接軍事費譬如退伍軍人恩給，年金，軍事團債費，靑少年團訓練費，軍事敎育費，軍需工業補助費，軍事國道費，船舶改善補助費，航空路施設費，滿洲事變及拓務省關係費用等等，假使也加算在內，那麼實質上要「占有國家總預算額的八〇％以上」（社會評論」本年九月號頁八六）。這種龐大的軍事費除出下述的從殖民地去括削之外，主要的來源是赤字公債。在這兒，懂得經濟常識的人就能明白，一個國家的發行公債必然的有一個限度，超出這個限度，就會引起惡性膨脹或者公債利息不付的危險，過去四年之內，日本國債從一九三一年九月以前的五十九億五千萬圓增加到一九三五年八月的九十二億二百萬圓，驟然地增加了五十多億，假使再將其中的外債匯兌率差額計算在內，國債總數當在九十七億六千萬圓以上，那麼這五十餘億的公債從那兒來的呢？問題很明白，述年的農業恐慌，一般民衆的貧窮，和中流資產階級的拮据，使口本公債的大部分收容在銀行的保管庫裹面；一九三一年底在銀行保管庫中的國債是十八億一千一百萬圓，到一九二五年六月底巳經增加到四十一億四千六百萬圓了，此外，還有四億四千三百萬圓的地方　還未加算在裏面。</p>
<p>存欵部的情形，更加黯淡；最近四年間存欵部的存欵，增加五億圓而到了三十二億圓的數目。可是在這四年之內存欵部保有的國債和地方債，却激增到第三表所示的程度：</p>
<p>第三表最近四年間有欵部保有偵券</p>
<p>（國債）（地方債）　計</p>
<p>一九三一年九月　一、〇〇三（百萬圓）五九〇　一、五九三</p>
<p>一九三五年六月　一、七一七　九五〇　二、六六七</p>
<p>除出國債地方債之外，存欵部保有的半官企業債券（如勸業·興業銀行及其他）也有八億五千五百萬圓之鋸，那麼存欵總額三十二億圓，而投入政府有價證券的金額已經到了三十五億二千二百萬圓，換句話講，就是連準傭金也巳經被流用了。</p>
<p>上面所引數字，表示了國債及地方債合計一百二十七億圓之內，有八十億以上固定在金融團體的保管庫裏面！</p>
<p>公債的大部分偏存在金融機關，這正表示了日本公債消化力的狹隘，和預示着公債消化力在目前已經到了枯涸的境地，同時也明白地說明了日木國家權力依存於金融資本的程度。</p>
<p>赤字公債的繼續發行已經顯著地感到了困難，而非常時」的軍事費還是沒有止境地擴大，一方面呢，農業恐慌非特沒有緩和而且日益深刻，對外貿易也因為匯兌下落的飽和和各國實行輸入防遏而漸趨鈍化，在這種拮据的情形之下，金融界總代理人的高橋藏相發出「假使囚為惹起惡性膨脹而破壞了信用，那時候國防也决不能鞏固的」聲明，在他的立場可以說是極自然的事情。他說：「對於萬一的時候，該有一點準備和餘裕才好」，這句話是帶有很深的含蓄的，一旦日本和外國（主要的當然是蘇聯）發生戰爭的時候，現在的時機和日俄戰爭當時已經不同，對外舉債的希望已經很微薄了，關於這件事情在日俄戰爭當時親自在倫敦舉過債的高橋是非常地明瞭的。</p>
<p>兩種不很調和的政治勢力，一種是强行軍事冒險全義的軍部，其他一種主張在適應國力的範圍之內漸進的金融資本家。這兩種勢力的爭執，是倫教海軍會議以來日本國內政治鬥爭的中心，也就是日本對外的所謂二重外交的基點，每年以頂算問題為中心而展開的政局，祇是這兩種勢力爭持的表面現象罷了。</p>
<p>現在讓我們來看一看來年度（昭和十一年一九三六）頂算的特徵吧。一方面，在大藏相當局，提出的主要方針依舊是　確立赤字公債漸减主義；和　國防費與一般行政費的調和，而軍部當局，還是依據着「軍部獨自的對世界情勢的觀點，」而提出了十三億三千萬元的要求。據大藏相頂算原案，（十一月二十七日「東京朝日新聞）來年度歲入總算二十二億三千八百萬元，比本年度的二十二億一千五百萬祇增加二千三百萬元）其中赤字公債六億六千六百八十萬元（比本年度的七億七千一百六十萬元减少一億零四百八十萬元）；歲出總額二十二億四千三百萬元，其中軍事費——陸軍四億八千九百萬元（本年度四億九千二百萬元，）海軍五億三千九百萬元本年度五億二千九百萬元，）共十億零二千八百萬元，已經占有了全歲出的百分之四十六弱，但是和軍部要求還是相差了三億一千萬元以上。照例，軍部兩相提出了猛烈的復活要求，經過了長時期的所謂「政治的衝折」，和超記錄的通宵，二十一小時的閣議，方才表面上貫澈了赤字公債漸减」的主張，而成立了包含着十億五千萬元之軍事費的日本史上未會有的二十二億七千二百萬元的頂算！下列的第四表就表示了來年度預算的輪廓：</p>

<p>從上面數字，我們看到赤字公債從本年以七億七千萬减到六億六千萬，不能不說大藏相已經貫澈了「漸减」的主張，但是當我們仔細地分析一下公債之可以漸减的原因，那就可以知道在這「漸减」的樂觀的背面，依奮隱藏着不容樂觀的成因，和許多人工的做作。第一，使來年度赤字公債减少的原因，主要的是下列的三種，　租稅收入的增加，　特別會計的援助，和　為着打開軍部與財政當局之僵局而臨時拼凑的所謂「各省的協力頂算」。現在，讓我們來逐一地分析一下這些原因的是否穩固和有吾存續的可能？</p>

<h3 id="c92">師範敎育之趨勢　（中） <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 中央大學敎育系主任常道直</p>
<p>我國之有近代師資訓練機關可追溯到光緒二十七年（公元一九零一年之欵定學堂章程。其中，將造就小學敎習」之師範學堂附設於中學堂，修業期間四年。至光精二十九年，奏定學堂章程中之初級師範學堂，則定為單獨設置修業期間五年。民國元年修訂學制，規定師範學校之修業期間為預料一年，本科四年，較普通中學多一年。迄至民國十一年，學制系統改革案公布以前，我國師範學制均係大體上仿自日本；師範生之學歷皆始於初等小學，中經高等小學，然後升入師範學校：詳考此種直接仿自日本之學制，實以法國制度為其原始的模型</p>
<p>現行學制之構造完成於民國十一年之學校系統改革案，中小學兩階段之編制仿行美國所謂六·三·三制；中學敎育期間延長，師範學校之程度亦隨而提高，其設置或為高級中學之師範科，或為六年制之單設師範學校，但亦得單設後二年或三年，收受初級中學（三年或四年）之畢業生。國民政府定都南京以後，學制上無重大變更，惟十七年三月大學院公布之中學暫行條例，規定高級中學分設普通。師範。職業各科，而單獨設置之師範學校，遂失其法律的依據。至二十一年十二月國民政府公布師範學校法，始再獲得法定的獨立地位。</p>
<p>依現行師範學校法，師範學校收初中　業生，修業期間三年，並得附設「特別師範科」，　高中畢業生，修業期間一年。所謂特別師範科，實即民元學制上師範學校正科之第二部，原係仿自日本者。按現制師範學校之程度比於高級中學，而高級中學乃由高等學校及大學頂科演化而來，可見自從民國十一年以來，師範學校在學制上之地位，實巳顯然較前提高，不過始終容身於中等敎育階段，其年限（包括先前的敎育及師範敎育之合併年數）較蘇聯略長，與法。意相伯仲，但已在美國一般標準之下，較諸英國之訓練學院已覺「瞠乎其後」，至於與德國現制之師資大學與英國之大學訓練部相形之下，更是望麈莫及了。</p>
<p>又現行師範學校加設所謂簡易師範學校及簡易師範科；前者之入學資格為小學畢業，修業年限四年，後者之入畢資格為初級中學畢業，條業年限一年。衡以現代各國師資敎育，皆力謀提高其敎育程度，充實其訓練內容，則此種簡易師範學校，似乎只可視為「急需造就義務教育師資起見」之一種權宜的設置。</p>
<p>就各方面情勢觀察，我國師範學校的程度，在目前尙無提高之可能，且亦無其必要。現代各國中，師範敎育程度最高者，首推英。德兩國，蓋因其小學敎育之年限較長，（英為五至十四歲，德為六至十四歲）故其敎師自需較長期間之準備。我　小學為六年，而義務敎育期間僅有四年；將來需耍最多之師資者，自為初級小學，現制師範學校所造就之師資已足勝任愉快。</p>
<p>英德現時已實行就大學中，或在單設之大學程度的敎育機關中訓練小擊師資，法國敎育專業界中亦時有主張廢除現行師範學校，使所有將來之小學敎師於修畢完全中學以後，更就大學受一年之專業訓練者，此類主張之動機，僅一部份在於增廣小學敎師之學識，其大部份，乃在提高小學敎師之社會的身分。在各國，要求提高師資訓練機關使立於大學同等地位者，多出於敎育專業界之主張，其用意蓋欲突破此種傳統的階級敎育之堡壘，矯正一般以小學敎師僅為「敎書匠」之偏見，而使之進於與醫師，律師，工程師相類之專業的地位。然在我國，所有小學校從始即非如歐洲小學之專為社會下層階級而設，故算師範敎育亦不具有保持現前社會階級分野之功能。我國師範學校表面上與法國現制雖有近似之點，然實有所不同。我國一般師範生吿需經歷初中敎育階段，與法國師範生之大多來自高等小學並不經由中學者不同：而且我國師範生之升入大學機會亦較多，因此師範敎育制度本身，不致全然與外界絕緣，而得免於成為社會某一特定階級之敎育機關。此為我國師範學制上値得保存之一優點。</p>
<p>前面已將師範敎育之史的起源，及其社會的功能，現代各國與我國之師範學制，作一概括的比較的說明。我們從各國師範教育的實際上，可以發見其全部精神所表著的幾個要點，以下依個人的管見所及，逐一叙述如决。</p>
<p>師範敎育從始即為推進國家文化政策之一種有力的手段。</p>
<p>在歐洲各　，飾範敎育較中學及大學敎育之歷史為短，當其創立之始即具有明晰的國家目的。法國大革命，發動於一七八九年，其革命領袖從始即見及師範敎育之重要，在一七九四年已着手創設模範的師範學校於巴黎，令全國各地選派學生入學，俾將來各返原籍舉辦同樣之師資訓練機關。拿破崙對於師資之重要，允有深切的認識，他在一八〇五年會說過：「在一切政治問題中敎育可說是最重要的了；除非有了一羣堅守確定信念之敎授人員，决不能有穩定的政治的國家」。他已經看淸民族國家之基礎在於共同的文化，共同的信心，與共同的理想，而師資之訓練叉為一切之根本。</p>
<p>普魯士旣被拿破崙所征服，其哲學者費希特氏於一八〇七到一八〇八年各季，在柏林作「對德意志民族演講」大意認德意志民族政治的再生之關鍵，乃在道德的與精神的復活；他認為必須以新的敎育培養一輩新的國民；此輩兒童當聽其自營共同生活，除少數敎師以外，與成人完成隔絕，以免被其董陶而致墮落。費希特氏雖然沒有提出一個具體的師資訓練計劃，但敎師之重要已於所分數語內充分表白。十九世紀初葉，普魯士政府於師資之訓練，為極堅决之努力，世人共認普魯士之設置敎師學院，造成訓練澈底且富於專業熱誠之敎師，在近代各國中，不愧為先進者，由此等師資所訓練的民衆，乃德民族之復興運動中之主力軍，是一件不容置疑的事寶。</p>
<p>法國之師範學校乃為養成適於革命後新政制卞之公民而設，德國之師範學院乃為挽救民族危亡運動中之創造物；兩者均足以表現近代師資訓練制度之產生，是挟着偉大的國家目的以俱來的。我們若是把師範學校僅看作造就意子之師的塲所，那就未免見小遺大了！</p>

<h3 id="c174">敎育行政之回顧與展望（上）　一月九日下午五時三十分　在中央廣播電臺講演 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>今天我是民國二十五年第一次到廣播電臺來演講、在這新年度剛剛開始的時候、我們自然應當回溯一下上年度的工作、根據過去的經騐、再作將來的計劃、在過去一年中間、敎育部對於敎育行政的設施、在這短時間內不能詳細叙述、現在祗就比較重要的新設施、作一簡略的報吿、</p>
<p>（一）整理專科以上學校</p>
<p>敎育部年來對於高等敎育整理、不遺餘力、整理的原因與方法、並不是憑主觀的意見、完全是憑客觀的事實、在未整理之先、曾按年派遣大批視察專員分赴各地視察專科以上學校、視察的人員、都是專家、視察的方法、是採取分科視察制度、二十三年曾視察四十餘校、視察結果、均已分別令飭改進、二十四年春復派多員馳赴各地視察一年來各校改進之實際狀況、計被視察之學校達九十餘校、統觀視察報吿、各校對於部令前示改進各要點、如整理院系、充實設備、取締缺課、嚴格招生、注重訓育及硏究、厲行職敎員專亦任制各端、大致均有相當改進、惟間有少數學校、困於環境、尚少成績表現、業經敎部重行指示、分飭遵辦、至院系之整理、根據兩項原則、一為重複或超過需要之院系的裁倂、二為師資設備缺乏發展無望之院系的整理、前者大都為文法科、後者大都為實科、年來大學院系的整理、已逐漸趨於合理化、非若數年前之裝作亂複雜、</p>
<p>（二）注重實用科學</p>
<p>敎育部為防止文實兩科畸形發展、及救人才過剩與缺乏的流弊起見、特規定大學各院系招生比額、以糾正文法科過分發展、使實用科學人才逐漸增多、以應國家建設之需、年來實科人數、較前數年已逐漸增多、同時文法科新生、亦已逐漸减少、增加與减少的數量、目前雖不甚大、但確已有增减的趨勢、同時對於實科院系的增加、亦在積極進行中、如以人力財力有限、事實上不能擴充者、則令飭增設講座、以期灌輸實用科學、年來實科之增設、計有六學院三學系二科六講座、即私立專科以上學校之補助、亦頗注重於實科之充實、</p>
<p>（三）施行學位授予法</p>
<p>學位授予法的制定、完全為提高學術程度、現已經立法院議决、呈奉國民政府明令公布、其最重要之點、為學位採取學士碩士博士三級制旅行日期、並由敎育部擬定呈奉國民政府明令規定、自二十四年七月一日施行、並經由部令飭各大學學院及各敎育廳局知照、至學位分級細則、及碩士學位考試細則、亦已由敎育部訂定公布施行、</p>
<p>（四）舉行未立案及已停閉之私立專科以上學校學生甄別試騐</p>
<p>該項試騐、過去曾舉行數次、均經由部考覈成績、分別年級、發給轉學證書、惟未立案之私立學校學生仍多、觀望不前、自失機支、事後又紛紛呈請救濟、二十四年冬乃再在北平上海兩處舉行一次、並令飭公立及已立案私立專科以上學校、自二十四年度起絕對不得再收未立案及已停閉之私立專科以上學校轉學生、曁未立案及已停閉之高級中等學校升學生、以示限制、現該項試騐、已舉辦完竣、參加試騐學生、計北平一百八十餘人、上海一千五百餘人、正在評閱試卷、不久即可揭曉、</p>
<p>（五）實施義務敎育</p>
<p>義務敎育之實施、在敎育部已計劃多年、此次遵照第四屆五中全會議决案、制定實施義務敎育暫行辦法大綱及施行細則、於上年五月奉行政院修正公布、施行內容、分三期進行、第一期自民國二十四年八月至二十九年七月、辦理一年制短期小學、第二期自二十九年八月至三十三年七月辦理二年制短期小學、第三期自三十三年八月起、義務敎育期間為四年、除辦理短期小學外、並施行推廣初級小學、充實原學級學額、厲行二部制、改良私塾、試行巡迴敎育等事、在施行義務敎育時期、短期小學不收學費、學生課本亦由學校免費供給、各地健全學齡兒童、均由地方敎育行政機關、督令其家長強迫入學、經費方面、由地方負担籌集、中央酌量補助、本年度中央補助各地之義敎補助費為二百四十萬另、加邊疆敎育經費及庚機關補助費、全計為三百二十萬元、現第一期義敎業已開始、各省市辦理情形均有報吿到部、甚為順利、</p>
<p>（六）實施兒童年</p>
<p>敎部為喚起全國民衆、注意兒童敎養、保障兒童身心健康、及圖謀兒童福利、使完成兒童之肉體精神、及社會的能力、故有兒童年之實施、實施期間為二十四年八月一日起、至今年七月三十一日止、中央由敎育部內政部實業部會同中華慈幼恊會、組織全國兒童年實施委員會、各省市縣由敎育行政衛生行政各機關、曁兒童事業團體、分別組織各省市縣兒童年實施委員會、已經成立向總會報到者、計有二十五省市、關於工作計劃、訂定實施辦法大綱及實施程序其重要工作、大約為兒童敎育·兒童健康、兒童保護及救濟兒童幸福團體組織四種、按照實施程序分別進行、在此一年中重要之兒童展覽會計有四個、　全國兒童讀物展覽會、一月三十一日在京舉行約一週、　全國兒童玩具敎具展覽會、四月在京舉行、　全國兒童衛生展覽會、五月在京舉行、　全國兒童繪畫展覽會、在滬舉行、日期未定、（未定）</p>

<p>終點紀錄之高速度活動摄影机</p>
<p>此次柏林大會之各種速度終點紀錄、决議採用一種最新式之高速度攝影機、作審判之標凖　、此種攝影機、同時兼備有秒記時之機件、在紀錄時兩種機件皆可同時發動週轉、乃用交流電周波數之特殊器調整者、速度分六級、最快為千分之一秒、次為百分之一秒、十分之一等、在紀錄應需時間上、可全無浪費云、</p>

<p>再優勝者、在每一事之成功與否、宜有十回百回之反覆試練、方得其效、至散步也、快樂也、名譽也、思考也、種種一時之幸福、亦不得不隨之放棄、以增強自己之性格、履行首先之條件、如是則勝也油然而堅矣、</p>

<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>多數的童子都冷酷地不去理睬他，不過唐恩，雖然他說他沒勇氣所以厭惡他，可是他兇很很地保護他，有敢凌辱他或使他懼怕的，他就立刻要享他以老拳的。他對朋友的義氣是不讓於小梅的，不過表示方法的精粗有不同罷了。</p>
<p>一天下午唐恩坐在溪邊，正專心硏究小蜘蛛家居的各種習慣，忽然聽見短　就那邊的一小段的談話。原來內達最近覺得有如芒刺在背，必欲確知誰為眞犯而後快；因為有一二個童子開始疑心他們或者是錯誤的，乃德繼續否認，又低首下心受人家的冷落。這疑點直使內達不能直使內達不能再忍，他私下不惜違背了裴先生的明白的誥誡，詰問乃德巳經有好幾次。這次瞧見乃德獨自個兒在牆陰下看書，又禁不住停下來，在那個忌諱的題目上，再來嘗探一下。在唐恩未到以前，他已盤詰着乃德至十分鐘之久，那蜘蛛學者首先聽到的幾個字，係是乃德以忍耐而哀訴的聲調說着的：</p>
<p>「莫如此，内達！啊莫如此！我不能告訴你，因為我不知道，你私下一直來麻煩我，是不應該的，裴伯伯早要你們不許為難我的。假如唐恩在這裏，你就不敢如此。」</p>
<p>『呸「我怕唐恩嗎？」他只是個惡草包，我想韜摩的錢，不是別人，却即是他拿的，你道的，只是不肯說，現在說罷！』</p>

<p>近三四年來，我國即盤旋於列強此種政策之下，作其傾銷政策之對象，為其過剩商品之尾閭，與我國經濟有密切關係之主要國家英，日，美，等三國，貨幣之貶値無不在百分之四〇至六〇之間，美國提高銀價，為提高我國貨幣購買力更進一步之策動，而使我國陷於近二年中極端困難之境地。</p>
<p>上表數字，吾人設欲分析其所代表之意義，則可知民國十八年（一九二九）各國旣未放棄金本位，而銀價亦未跌落，我國外匯保持常態，一九三〇年銀價開始急劇之下落，而我國外匯亦隨之傾墜，英匯十八年為二〇·五二四便士，至十九年即降為一四·七六九便士（美日匯亦然），至二十年達於極點，英匯僅合十二便士有零，美匯二二元二角，日匯四五元二角，為十餘年來所從未見之低價。（未完）</p>

<p>— 柳亞子</p>
<p>自從我被選爲中國國民黨第四屆中央監察委員以來，便很少講話。因爲照本黨的紀律，黨員對外不得自由發表言論，何况我還是個掛名的中委呢？不過這一次瘦鵑寄萍兩兄要我爲申報婦女專刋寫稿，事出特殊，情在難却，只好破例一次了。、</p>
<p>我先得說明，對於一切的一切，我是主張進化論的。但我的進化論，却並不是完全來路貨，而包含着道地國貨的成份在內。我不懂經學，也不很崇拜孔二先生，但對於禮運大同公羊三世之說，我是極端贊成的。自然，不管它究竟是孔門嫡說，抑是漠儒附會了。我對於孫先生的三民主義，沒有深切的硏究，我却以爲民族主義民權主義民生主義是應該分爲三個階段的。這樣，融會古今，參和新舊，可以說公羊的據亂世，就是孫先生的民族主義階段，也就是近代西方學者所稱爲封建制度社會的一階段。公羊的昇平世，禮運的小康世，就是孫先生的民權主義階段，也就是西方學者所稱爲資本主義社會的一階段。公羊的太平世，禮運的大同世，就是孫先生的民生主義階段，也就是西方學者所稱爲社會主義社會的一階段。以上所說，便是我所主張的進化論的骨幹了。</p>
<p>應用到婦女問題上面去，內言不出，外言不入，嫁雞隨雞，嫁狗隨狗，當然是封建制度的社會了。組織小家庭，參預生產事業，脫離了封建的桎梏，却又從金錢制度下面從金錢制度下面生活，出賣勞力不足，繼之以出賣性器官，這是資本主義社會所不能避免的。以後，各盡所能，各取所需，打破婚姻制度，提倡自由戀愛，便非達到社會主義的社會不興了。孫先生叫我們迎頭趕上去，當然要推翻封建社會的制度，但也並不以追隨資本主義爲滿足，一切的一切，都是如此，婦女問題何獨不然？</p>
<p>講到這裏，我要看看現世界的實際情形了。希特勒要婦女還到廚房去，這是担心着資本主義没落的現象，索性想把倒車開還到封建社會的老家去，其如此路不通何？在我們貴國，更有畸形的狀況；一方面鄉村婦女還在過十八世紀的地獄生活；一方面都市婦女，却已走上了資本主義沒落的道路上去了。海關進口化妝品的激增，女性的甘以玩物商品自居，哪裏是她們的罪惡，只是世紀末的病症，已潰爛到不可收拾的徵象罷了。男性在苦悶不堪的時候，以醇酒婦人來陶遣，難道女性便不能夠探取同一的態度嗎？所以提倡新女德，提倡新的賢母良妻主義，用心非不良苦，恐怕還是藥不對症吧！</p>
<p>要解決婦女問題，便要解決整個的社會制度問題。公羊的太平世，禮運的大同世，孫先生的民主主義階段，西方學者所稱的社會主義社會，都在等候着我們呢。</p>
<h3 id="c202">發刋辭 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>婦女專刋經了兩個月的籌備，終於在今天和讀者相見了。自恨不為女兒身，對於婦女問題。並沒有深刻的認識；因此本刋之於婦女界，也不敢負荷指導的使命，僅僅以男子的立塲，來與諸姑姊妹作深切的硏究，希望以後能將婦女的地位逐漸提高起來，打倒因襲的重男輕女的觀念。</p>
<p>自從德意志獨裁者希特勒氏高唱了「婦女回到家庭中去」的論調以後，一時非難之聲，譁然四起，婦女界尤其反對，以為希氏不懷好意，他打算把婦女埋沒在家庭裏，對於社會和國家的大事無權過問，便可由男子們把持一切，任所欲為了。</p>
<p>獨裁者的主張，當然不免有自私自利的偏見，夾雜在內，這是萬萬要不得的。在編者瞧來，婦女們的出處，還須採用折衷辦法，就是社會和國家有事時，便當挺身而出，為社會為國家直接服務，社會和國家沒事時，那麽不妨退守在家庭中，做伊們的賢妻良母。</p>
<p>諸姑姊妹不要以為家庭中的範圍太狹小了，任務太瑣屑了，不屑去一一躬親。古人有言，治國必須齊家，家齊而後國治，這話實在是不錯的。為家庭服務，其重要性正不在為社會與國家服務之下。譬如一家主婦，整天的不在家中，將兒女交與乳媽敎養，將家政任由婢僕處理，其所得的結果，一定不會良好。兒女智識初開，就養成了種種惡劣的習慣；其影響於社會和國家最為重大。家政不自過問，由婢僕們胡作胡為，勢必弄得雜亂無章，甚至弊端百出；使為夫者常常有後顧之憂，那裏能專心為社會為國家服務？所以我以為婦女們離不了家庭，家庭中實在需要一位賢妻良母。</p>
<p>婦女們倘以為家庭中的事情太簡單了，要不了多少時間，那麽大可於理家之暇，從事於學術的探討。法國的居禮夫人，以發明雷錠造福世界，這是一個最好的榜樣。有為者亦若是，願大家共同努力吧！</p>
<p>座談</p>
<h3 id="c203">對於申報創辦「婦女專刋」的感想 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 詹詹</p>
<p>申報於二十五年度開始的時候，每週六特輯「婦女專刋」足見該報同人思慮的周到。這個曾經一度引人注意的婦女問題，現在已經連婦女自身都不去注意的婦女問題，該報特去舊事重提以移轉社會人士的眼光，自婦女立塲而言，不可謂不是一種十分可喜的事！</p>
<p>有許多人說，現在男女已站在平等的地位，婦女並無任何特殊的問題。如有問題，就是種種男女共同的問題—如職業敎育，經濟等等—而非婦女獨有的問題。婦女須在非常狀況之下，才會發生問題。現在再談婦女問題，似已是明明白白黃花了。</p>
<p>驟看起來，好像婦女已無特殊問題，可供討論。仔細一想，才知道婦女切身的問題正多着呢！不但在特殊狀況之下婦女有許多問題，就是男女的地位完全平等，而婦女的問題仍然存在—而且是永遠的存在。</p>
<p>一個女子在法律上，經濟上，敎育上，政治上，都可以與男子平等，但女子自身仍有他特殊的任務。為母為妻的職責，同為父為夫的職責，是不是能完全一致的。因此，就有許多問題是做母親同做妻子所應當注意的了。若以實際情形而言，現在中國的女子，無論是知識階級或是無知的婦女，大部的人生活狀況，是與一般男子不同的。伊們的範圍多限在家庭之內；伊們的職務，多為理家育兒。事實旣是如此，我們斷斷不能不顧事實去唱高調。為提高伊們生活的效率起見，婦女的專門刋物，更有它的特殊價值了。</p>
<p>至於今日我國—以至於全世界—的男女，是否完全站在平等的地位呢？這是無論什麽人都知道其不然。至多我們可以說一句一般人正在一部份的人正在反對男女平等呢。若以實際情形而論，這個世界至今還是男子為政的世界，也是無論什麽人都要承認的。站在這種地位的婦女，她們的問題尤其多了。「婦女專刋」的創辦，不但為母為妻者可以當它做一個喉舌，一伸其不平之鳴。婦女在家庭中的問題，同在社會上的問題，都要借它的篇幅去發表，去討論。能夠這樣，「婦女專刋」才有它實際的貢獻呵。</p>

<h3 id="c204">聶曾紀芬印象記 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 黃寄萍</p>
<p>本刋出版的計劃定當以後，我們便進行着兩樁事：一是特約婦女先進撰述文稿，一是搜羅關於婦女問題的材料。很想把這園地展拓出來，使國內婦女界有共同探討的機會；不過我們這個心願，能否切實做到，却未敢預斷。要如婦女界能通力合作的話，這小小願望，或許不成幻想。至於我個人預備每週發出一部分時間，分訪女界領袖，紀其偉論，以為凖綱，疏漏之處，還望讀者指正！</p>
<p>就上海市而言，女界人才輩出，會發議論，寫文章的人，不計其數，然而智德兼全，以發揚母敎著稱的，倒也不可多覯。想來想去，最先想到的，便是聶老太太——曾紀芬。她是曾文正公的女兒，聶雲台先生的母親，今年高壽八十五歲，一生勤儉持家，努力家庭敎育，要說眞的賢妻良母，堪稱當代第一人！</p>
<p>我訪問聶老太太的時間，是一月九日的早晨，當走進遼陽路崇德堂的時候，那一幢洋房裏，寂然無聲，雲台先生正在佛堂誦經，家人引入客室少待，見壁間所懸肖像三，左右並立的是曾文正公及夫人，另一幅便是聶老太太了。一會兒雲台先生邀入書房，他非常謙和，有士君子風度，一口湖南話，不忘本色。在我以前的想像中，雲台先生是實業界泰斗，豈知一談之下，纔知道他也是博古通今，學術超羣的人；近年來閉門謝客，於古今書籍，無所不窺。於是，我們從中國古代文化談起，一直談到泰西的文化，日本的維新；蘇聯的政情；中國的婦女，他的話匣一開，滔滔不絕，問題愈談愈大，離我所要問的便越來越遠了。最後他對梁漱溟先生推崇備至，把梁著「中華民族自救運動中之最後覺悟」一書，認為靑年必須一讀的名著。兩小時一瞬過去了，我說現在要談談本題，請介紹老太太出見，因此我們就緩步登樓。</p>
<p>崇德老人很輕快的出來，一副溫厚慈祥的笑容，使人肅然起敬，精神壯健，好像六十許人。我為節省老太太的時間，不敢多談，只問了下面幾句話：</p>
<p>老太太治家六十年來，所得經騐怎樣？</p>
<p>我向來本廉潔，勤儉，和平的宗旨，訓導兒輩，大家同心同德，互助互勉，所以家庭之間，從無閒言閒氣，兒孫輩都能奮發上進，到如今，依然不變初志。據我的經騐，只要家長能尊重禮義，家敎便不致頹廢的。（雲台先生說：家母秉性溫慈，從無疾言厲色，故其所言，兒孫輩無不樂從。）</p>
<p>老太太對於小家庭與大家庭制度的意見怎樣？</p>
<p>我以為各有利弊，照現在的趨勢，大家庭沒有存在的可能。即是我家也採取小家庭制度，但彼此互相聯繫，休戚相關，仍不失大家庭的樂趣。就一般情形來說，小家庭不顧長上的贍養，是極大的缺點，我吿訴你幾件事實：海關某高級人員月薪八百，他父親是稅務司，母親老了，父子都不理會，母向子借十元八元，老是一副神氣，這是一樁事。某老乞丐到某公館求乞，主人掏出一元，由窗口丟出，老丐取銀含淚而去，人家問他何獨得一元之賜？他說這是我兒子的別墅呀！又是一樁事。海上某名人，擁資巨萬，而他的父親，還在紐約街上趕馬車，你想這些事，是合理的麽？</p>

<p>聽說府上曾刋行過家言旬刋，並有家族集會，請賜吿其經過。</p>
<p>這是往事了，我們因為一家八十餘人，分散各方，不易集中，便由吾兒雲台，主編「聶氏家言週刋」，後改旬刋，家人自由發表意見，五六年中，發行由百餘份而至三千餘份。起初只供家人閱讀，後來親友素閱，甚至各省市縣亦來素閱，每年出彙刋一集，共出五六集，七八年前，雲台體病，家報停刋了。當時每星期日開「聶氏家庭集益會」一次，少長咸集，的是盛舉。每次紀錄，也專刋小冊，以示不忘。</p>
<p>老太太現時如何消遣？</p>
<p>我不常坐馬車上街，見見市面，選製各種藥丸，或散放銀錢，以周濟貧病的人，聊盡素願，此外便沒有什麽了。至此時已响午，我便吿辭而退。</p>

<h3 id="c207">關於中國的女子留學日本 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— 一髮</p>
<p>當去年日金低落的時候，便有許多女學生，乘此機會到日本來求學，現在中日貨幣價格，雖近乎相等，而女學生的來日求學的，仍舊不少。日本女子的敎育宗旨，和男子的截然不同，故女學校大都只分家事及縫紉等科。普通女子以中學及高等女學畢業爲度，入女子大學或和男子同學受大學敎育者不多。我國留日女學生中，大都硏究醫科。入產科齒科眼科等專門學校。其他入各私立大學，學習文科法科經濟科的也不少，學敎育農業工業的，便很顯著的佔着少數。</p>
<p>到日本來求學的女學生，因大都要入專門以上的學校，所以在國內至少要得着高中以上的畢業證書，才得入校。日本私立學校，雖常有無試騐而招收我國的學生。但是入學考騐極難的學校　，亦未嘗沒有。我國女學生在國內聽得日本學校，入學很易　，於是有未帶證明文件而來日本的，結果常陷於進退兩難之途。</p>
<p>我國男女學生的社交，素來是公開的。尤其是留日女學生，因生居異國，舉目無親，至少有幾個男朋友，得互相照應。但是在舊禮敎極重的日本，對於留日女生的和男友往來　，常引起懷疑的。而難免有少數女學生因受男同學的追逐而荒廢了學業，是十分可嘆的。事實上男學生獨居異邦，對居室的整理，衣襪的</p>
<p>綴補，都要自己動手。而女生却常有不肯做此種瑣屑事情，而雇着日本下女奉侍着。因此日本人又誤認了全中國的婦女，都和留學女生一樣的不肯管理家務的，一面便更顯得日本女子的勤勞，關於治家了。</p>
<p>我國留學生到了國外，總是終年穿着學生裝和西裝。卽使有人帶了幾件中國衣服，忽然穿着出來，常受朋輩譏笑，這是一種特殊的心理。但西洋人和日本人的來我國內地的，又從未見過他們穿起中國的長袍短褂。所以要問留學生為什麽不穿中裝，是誰也不能答覆的。獨有留日的女學生，除了有時因好奇心而穿着和裝玩玩之外，都是穿着旗袍，和國內一樣，這一點値得使人欽佩，她們還是保存着我國的國粹。</p>
<p>女學生在中國，已有養尊處優，不屑處理家務的現象。自從留學之後，此種心理或者要更進一層。她們時常鄙視日本女子的甘為奴隸，以奉侍男子為榮。而一方面觀察日本女子的勤於家務，夫婦間的和靄相親的現象，心裏未嘗不在欽佩羨慕着。所以我國留日女學生對日本女子的觀察，是在相對狀態之下的。</p>
<p>常看見成羣的日本婦女，遠涉重洋的嫁給海外僑居，或是和各地的土民通婚。有時為生活所迫，隨着男子，出外墾殖。不辭千里之遙到國外留學，為學業而遠離祖國，未嘗不為日人所尊敬的。</p>

<p>— 秦王茵玖</p>
<p>這眞是一件怪可怕的故事，雖然並不曾有飛機投炸彈，以及老虎吃人等等的流血的勾當，但是我一想起，就不免要心跳，而且還有無限的傷感；為的是這事變中的犧牲者——秋雲姊到如今還是不知道飄零在何處呢！</p>
<p>秋雲姊在我們同學中原是最幸福的一個，伊有着天所賦予的美貌，健康，和聰明，在在比別人勝過幾分；我們往往要懷疑天是和校裏的Mrs.　Nuttall一樣地偏愛着伊的，否則何以伊在學業上的成績旣是這樣的好，而伊的軀壳又是那樣的優秀呢？尤其惹人妒羨的是伊還有一個極快樂的家庭：伊父親雖不曾做什麽大官，但因久在银行界服务，地位颇高，经济比较很充裕，却又不是擁資數十萬數百萬的大銀行家，可以無需担心什麼綁票；伊母親是一位前輩的師範畢業生，性情當然極慈愛，頭腦也很新；伊有三個哥哥，第一第二兩位已有着相當的職業，第三位還在讀書，對於伊都是非常的友愛；而在父母方面，因為先有了三個男孩子，方始得到伊這個女孩子的緣故，更是鍾愛得伊比三個哥哥更甚。伊在這種稱心如意的環境中漸漸地長成起來，眞像天鵝一樣的逍遙，舒暢。在學校裏，更受着敎師們的一致的稱譽，同學方面，卽使因為伊似乎略略驕傲了些，不免有一部份人敵視着伊，這一些不相干的障礙，絕對不致影響到伊的美滿的生活，伊終於很幸福地在大學部畢業了，並且還得到第一句的甲等榮譽獎。當我們在禮堂口握手道別的時候，伊提着伊表姊送給伊的一個花籃，笑嘻嘻地向我說道：</p>
<p>原來伊父親深受伊這一個獨生的女兒，當伊未畢業的一個月之前，已在給伊凖備留學的手續了。伊自己當然是十二分的興奮，幾乎每次逢到一個人，就要告訴這件事。</p>
<h3 id="c209">標凖婦人　黑衣宰相夫人的儉樸 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>伊很可以住在一所高大的官邸裏，但是伊情願住在鄕間質樸的家庭裏。</p>
<p>伊很可以僱用成羣的僕役，過養尊處優的生活，但是伊喜歡躬自處理家庭裏的一切事務，甚至於入廚房操作。伊很可以和當朝一般貴人交往，但是伊願意和尋常人閒談。</p>
<p>假使旁人處在伊的地位，一定是目空一切，但是伊呢，依然和藹可親，亳不擺出貴婦人的架子。</p>
<p>這位貴婦人是誰？便是全世界大名鼎鼎的意大利狄克推多黑衣宰相墨索里尼的夫人賴謙爾。</p>
<p>墨索里尼現方殫心竭慮，和阿比西尼亞作戰，假使此次戰爭，意軍能大獲勝利，迫令阿國割讓巨土，加入意國版圖，那末，墨氏的地位，比前更為鞏固，將成意大利人民崇拜的偶像，假使兵連禍結，久無結局，戰士的赤血，不斷地濺污疆場，財庫的黃金，源源地輸送外國，一旦國內發生恐慌，墨氏的權威，或不免墜落，墨氏的長子白魯諾，次子維多利沃，現都在阿國前綫空軍中服役，他的女婿齊亞諾伯爵，也任空軍敢死隊的指揮。</p>
<p>意大利全國人民對於意阿戰爭，都願表示愛國熱誠，同時對於戰爭的勝敗，都異常關切，但是沒有一人比墨索里尼的夫人賴謙爾更關切的，因為伊丈夫一生的幸福，和伊兩位公子一位女婿的生命，都和戰爭有密切的關係，伊呢，雖憂心如焚，却只密藏在胸中，不願向世人表現些微，伊的起居常度，依然不變，他生在卑微的環境中，從不抱養尊處優的願望，伊避免一切社會交際，從不參加任何大禮節，伊不求分沾丈夫的光榮，伊曾久住在米蘭一所平凡的屋子裏，現在呢，一年中的大部分，仍隱居在鄕間。</p>
<p>伊避免公衆注目，而圖安享家庭生活，是出於伊的本性，並非有所勉強，但是伊縱然想變更境况，也沒有這種機會，因為墨索里尼向來主張婦女的地位應該在家庭之中，這是意大利和全世界所稱道的。</p>
<p>墨夫人還有幾種特點，伊選擇肥嫩的雛雞，更勝於了解國家的政治，伊烹調美味的魚膾，更勝於招待會中的周旋，伊愛聽小兒的呀呀學語，更勝於交際社會中的攀談，伊對於一切時裝衣着，貴重飾品，和其他奢侈物，都不屑一顧。</p>
<p>假使墨索里尼明日失權下野，又成一個貧漢，他的夫人能夠和他安然再過若干年前他倆年靑貧苦時的儉約生活，亳不感覺痛苦，假使到那時，伊有所嘆息，决非因為伊的好夢已破，却只因為伊丈夫要使意大利成一無上強國的雄圖，中途失敗，這是可以斷言的，伊的願望，不過和伊丈夫子女安居在一所平凡的屋內，享那天倫之樂，到那時，伊正成了那種婦女。</p>
<p>按賴謙爾做了宰相夫人，正好養尊處優，並可大出其風頭，受大衆的恭維，雖伊丈夫主張婦女的地位是在家庭之中，但伊也未嘗不可你說你的，我幹我的，現在伊却隱在鄕間，躬操臼，不脫鄕婦的氣味，在一般摩登官太太眼光中，伊簡直是一個傻女人，然而摩登官太太的乖巧，有誰人稱道呢？</p>

<p>稱頌為重生父母</p>
<p>（上略）余自結婚以後。更覺衰弱不堪。精神萎靡。肌肉消瘦。罹有頭目暈眩。腰背痠疼等症。服藥多種。全無影響。藥爐茶灶。消磨歲月。而腎虧症象。頻見增加。近年以來。更形肢冷體顫。心悸盜汗（中略）承詹念曾醫師施以電療。並囑向中英藥房購服斯丹那氏生殖素。服後霍然而起。衰弱症象。逐一消失。連服數盒。卽覺頭腦淸健。腰背有力。肌肉豐盈。精神煥發。追念囊昔。宛如一塲春夢。若詹醫師妙手回春。生殖素靈丹起疴。誠不營重生之父母也。</p>

<p>— 喬文彬</p>
<p>本症病源。係消化不良所致。以致胃內食積不化。見食輒厭。</p>
<p>凡患胃口不開者。食慾旣减。攝取營養亦自感不足。每致釀成衰弱等症。考其所以呆滯不化及食慾不振者。皆緣胃內胃液之缺乏。如投以胃液製劑。則自胃健食消。而胃口旺開也。</p>
<p>「健胃素」服入後。卽能化為多量之胃液。消化積食。輔助營養。連服數日。卽覺食慾大增。胄口大開矣。但如罹有胃炎胃疼者。則宜先服「胃痛靈」去其病患。</p>

<h3 id="c221">中國電影與「非常時」的一九三六年 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>不是武斷，也不是預言，而根據現實的事態的發展之觀察，一九三六年將是一個「非常時：」它繼着一九三五年之後、在危機四伏的世界中，將更顯得共危難和動亂。一九三五年雖在戰雲密佈，千瘡百孔之中度過，然而一九三六年能否坦然度此巨艱，在這年代剛開始的陽春正月，我們也就很難說。回首過去，剛溜走的這一九三五年，東菲已繼遠東之後，同樣發生了帝國主義侵略半殖民地的戰爭，所不同者，僅前者的政府在人民的敦促之下，奮起抗戰；而後者因為要維護和平，以至迭連損失了數百萬平方公里的省區。但是帝國主義者在危機緊迫之中，去掠奪弱小民族的利益，以謀自己的出路，則二者都是相同的。</p>
<p>際九一八事變發生之時，我國的電影曾因受這時局的刺戟，無論質或量皆為之一振。題材的選取，已不再因循以前那種封建型的義俠故事，以及荒唐的低級趣味的小說，不少以反帝民族戰爭為題材的片子在市塲上出現，而且，幾乎中國電影的生產技術之改善，也同時以這時期為一個最大的轉機。但實際上說，到底還是中國民衆對於要求民族獨立解放的情緒的高漲之表現，因為我們旣不能否認電影與戲劇同樣是教育的工具，是戰鬥的武器之一，那末，中國民衆之擁護以反帝為題材的片子之出現，而至影響一般電影從業者之兢相出產這類影片，自然不是偶然的。可是事態一轉移，反帝的高潮在環境阻遏下低沉下去，投機的電影從業者於是又轉向了，觀乎這兩年以來，各電影公司多數出了一些遠離現實的片子，甚至還有人把女人的大腿搬到銀幕上去，做着他們底甜蜜的，迷醉的，粉紅色的夢。而這一兩個年頭，我國的危難却比諸九一八事變的那年代還要加深，敵人更乘危一再侵佔華北，以完成其大陸政策的迷夢。然而電影作者不把握住當前這種題材，倒反向頹廢的路上去鑽，企圖間接的替敵人麻醉國人的神經，這是何等可悲的事！</p>
<p>現在又交上了「非常時」的一九三六年，危難只有比上一個年代更增無已，萬難當前，中國的電影又將往何處去呢？難道還好在陰霾的世界里，在敵人的砲火澆煉之下，重做那綺麗的迷夢麽？我想，卽使大衆們不明白地表露出他們對於電影題材的新要求，但是在目前的景况中，電影的作者也該深刻的自省了。自然，在去年，比較有進步性的片子未嘗是沒有的，只是以合部的數量相較起來，也就未免差太遠了。</p>
<p>展開了一九三六的年代，這個「非常時」的多事之秋為了自救，也為了救這行將帝國主義分裂，破壞的世界，我們也得展現一下中國的電影，看他將如何反映這個動亂之年？</p>

<p>當時顓頊和他的黨徒，追到了不周山的斷處，見共工的黨散在那里，便一聲呌喊，殺將過來，共工也集了黨徒，與顓頊作生死之决鬥、一時喧聲振天，流血遍地。（十九）</p>
<h3 id="c223">橋 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 家人</p>
<p>有一座長長的木板搭起來的高橋，把市鎭和鄕村連絡着。它是重要的，彷彿人體上的骨絡那樣。有着它，一座橋，兩端的人們於是開始繁密的來往了。想着從前沒有橋的時候，雖然有舟子可以代替橋，運載兩端的人們，總是花去了太多的時間和人力。</p>
<p>為着這一邊那一邊都覺得它的需要，於是由兩把尖兒入物唱頭，向有錢人捐款，向店家攤派。……結果的數目有多少，是一個謎！但總是一個大數目的吧。</p>
<p>於是橋造成了，可是是那樣潦草——：</p>
<p>打幾隻木樁進河底里，在木樁上架幾根橫木，又舖上三大塊木板，呌鐵丁子釘牢着。一條橋完成了。兩個月的工程還不夠的。而橋上的兩旁的欄杆呢，却是用薄弱的竹竿子圍起來，人打橋上走過，還沒把胳膊擱着，那欄杆搖搖振動了。</p>
<p>然而，總算有那樣一條橋讓人們做點道兒，一種新的快樂的感覺也會浮上人的腦子。</p>
<p>—像不着地的懸在半空似的。夠危險啊！</p>
<p>跟着却有人從腦子上浮上這樣的念頭。因為從上面走過，木板便嗦嗦的作響，似乎會一下子掉落去的樣子。而從橋下，坐在舟子上往下望，瞧着那木樁接着木樁的中間，因為當河水漲了的時候，被水力冲擊着，一次又一次，那啣接着的地位便漸漸移開，如同放上去似的，人從橋上走，動着動着，會坍下來的，幾乎使人隨時隨地發生一種可怕的預感。</p>
<p>而每天在橋上經過的人，是熙熙攘攘，數也數不淸的。</p>
<p>終有一天出亂子的，從橋下來往的船上人會往往替橋上的人擔心着。</p>
<p>春天的雨水特別多，常常一連淋子幾天不停，於是河水漲了，水緩緩朝上湧，水平面差不多跟橋岸相齊，伸手可以浸進水里去，木樁是掩沒在水中看不見了。於是那橋，更彷彿浮在水面上。</p>
<p>而春天，在橋的這端是城市，那端是村莊的區域，照例子，每逢春天，是舉行賽龍舟的盛大的季節，因為有了那橋，人站在橋上瞧是夠味的，於是地點從別地方改在這里，橋的那面了。</p>
<p>那天下午，從村莊的，從城市的兩面來到橋上赴會的人不知有多少，橋的兩邊欄杆自頭至尾是擠了滿滿的人了。龍舟在滔滔的水波上飛奔着，一隻對一隻，擂着鼓，打着銅鑼，互相競爭。橋上無數的人們看到高興的時候，都鼓着掌，放開嗓子呌着，仗助勁兒。有人給推在後面，瞧不大淸楚，便用力往前軋，而前面的人又往後軋，大家都忘記自己是踩在浮在水面上似的橋，軋來軋去的結果，由開頭被軋斷的欄杆起，其餘的欄杆都連帶地側下去，於是人也一個個滾到水底去，而橋下的河流的湍急的，深不可探底，滾進去的卽刻給捲進怒吼的大漩渦里去，沉了；歿了。</p>
<p>沒有滾下去的，看見自己同來的人呌水浪吞了去，於是一片偉大的呌喊聲充滿空間。</p>
<p>亦成為賽龍舟偉大的祭禮。</p>
<p>那一回的事是距離橋落成後的三個月。這罪過到底讓給誰呢？也許只有讓無知的橋，和人們無知的詛咒。</p>
<p>而繼着，雨還滂沱的傾瀉下來，十天或者半月綿綿無休止，河水是一步一步高上來，連全座橋給浸在濃濁的黃色的水中了。最後城市的城門也落着水閘，舟子同樣駛到江邊縛了根粗繩子在岸上的大橋幹，籠緊起來，於是兩端的人們暫時只好斷絕關係。呌一片茫茫的大水分開着。等過了一些日子，雨停，河水逐漸退落，可是橋幾乎全部被毀了。而一座橋是不能少的，自然得重要造作，但這回為了前次賽龍舟悲劇的教訓，大家感到要求永久安全一點，最好是用士敏土地合鐵筋來鑄造，可是須有一筆很不小的工程費……</p>
<p>大規模的募捐與攤派開始了。</p>
<p>數個月過去後，聽說收穫是滿意的，兩端的人是異樣歡躍高興着。一邊兒造新橋也開工動土了。又不久新橋是成功了。却跟老底子的橋還是一模一樣，潦草的。不同的是稍為寬敞些。</p>
<p>人們是失望了：有着要造士敏土鐵筋的橋的錢，為什麽又是一座拼七搭八的木橋呢？</p>
<p>造橋的錢是大家集凑的，以往沒有橋雖是往還很跋涉，可是亦無為着修　橋造橋的意外的負担，而現在，橋有了，同時多了一種想不到近於強制地攤派，至於一座安全的橋，倒是直直不曾產生出來。看到　座橋，人是會不禁忿然和詫異的。</p>

<p>唐白居易曾作長恨歌，詠明皇寵愛貴妃事，纏綿悱惻，使天下多情人讀之，為之涕下，惟字裏行間，頗有譏諷明皇重色輕國之不當。導演史東山為新華編導長恨歌，描寫現社會有志靑年為生活努力，未遑獻殷勤於床頭人，致生誤會，造成莫大之悲劇，其意義雖與白居易之長恨歌逈異，而悲慘痛恨則同，正似白居易所謂天長地久有時盡，此恨綿綿無盡期！且史導演諷刺工商業中人之險惡奸詐，嫉妬競賽；不知自關門徑，獨樹一幟，只知影戤仿效，爭相貶價賤售，置成本信用於不顧，於是整個之工商業，遂至一敗墜地，不可收拾，史導演旣有如此意識，復採羅曼斯古事，以成此絕大悲劇，主角王人美在片中所唱之長恨歌，凄絃欲絕，婉轉動聽，視漁光曲尤勝一籌也。</p>

<p>Tokyo: Ambassador Hachiro Arita arrived in Yokohama at 6:00 AM on the 10th aboard the Chichibu Maru. On board the ship, he said, "I have returned to the country this time on the order of the Foreign Minister and will serve as the Ambassador to China. I have been away from my country for two years, and I am not familiar with the recent situation in China and Sino-Japanese relations, so I cannot express an opinion. I have served as a secretary in Beijing and Tianjin, and as the Director of the Asian Bureau, but the knowledge I gained in the past cannot be applied now. According to my speculation, when dealing with the China issue, we must not only treat China as an opponent. Diplomacy with China should be carried out in conjunction with diplomacy with Europe and America. We must make Europe and America understand that Japan is working for the stability of East Asia and has no intention of annexing China." (10th Allied Telegram)</p>

<p>Nanjing - The Legislative Yuan passed two important financial bills at its meeting on the 10th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>I. Supplementary Coinage Regulations</p>
<p>The minting of supplementary coins is the exclusive responsibility of the Central Mint, and their issuance is the exclusive responsibility of the Central Bank. The types of supplementary coins are as follows: Three types of nickel coins: 20-cent nickel coin, total weight 6 grams, made of pure nickel; 10-cent nickel coin, total weight 4.5 grams, made of pure nickel; 5-cent nickel coin, total weight 3 grams, made of pure nickel. Two types of copper coins: 1-cent copper coin, total weight 6.5 grams, made of 95% copper, 5% tin and zinc; 1/2-cent copper coin, total weight 3.5 grams, made of 95% copper, 5% tin and zinc. The supplementary coins are calculated decimally. The number of coins per legal tender yuan is as follows: five 20-cent nickel coins, ten 10-cent nickel coins, twenty 5-cent nickel coins, one hundred 1-cent copper coins, two hundred 1/2-cent copper coins. The design of the supplementary coins shall be drafted by the Ministry of Finance, submitted to the Executive Yuan, and then submitted to the National Government for promulgation. The number of supplementary coins accepted in each transaction is limited to 20 legal tender yuan for nickel coins and 5 legal tender yuan for copper coins. However, this restriction does not apply to the collection of taxes and the exchange by the Central Bank. Existing circulating supplementary coins shall be withdrawn, destroyed, and re-minted by the Ministry of Finance. However, within a specified period, they may continue to be used at market prices. The specific measures and time limit shall be determined by the Ministry of Finance by order. If supplementary coins are naturally worn out due to prolonged use, causing the legal weight to decrease by up to 5%, they may be exchanged for new coins at the Central Bank. However, if they are intentionally damaged or stamped, causing the weight to decrease or the appearance to change, they shall lose their circulation validity and may not be used or exchanged. Counterfeiters of supplementary coins and those who harm the credit of supplementary coins shall be punished according to law. These regulations shall take effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>II. Law on Penalties for Tax Evasion on Goods</p>
<p>In this law, "goods tax" refers to the national tax levied on goods according to law. The penalties for evading goods tax, except for customs duties which are subject to the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, shall be in accordance with the provisions of this law. Those who evade goods tax shall be fined from one to ten times the amount of tax evaded, depending on the severity of the circumstances. Those who attempt to evade tax but fail shall be fined up to three times the amount of tax evaded. Those who evade goods tax, where the amount involved is 100 yuan or more and the circumstances are serious, may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to two years or detention, in addition to the fine prescribed in the preceding article. Those who intend to evade goods tax and commit the crime of obstructing official duties, disturbing public order, dereliction of duty, murder, or assault shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the chapter on concurrent punishment for multiple crimes in the Criminal Law. Public officials who commit the acts described in the preceding three articles shall have their penalties increased by up to one-third in accordance with the provisions of each article. Public officials who protect others who commit the acts described in the preceding four articles shall have their penalties increased by up to one-half in accordance with the provisions of each article. Goods on which goods tax has been evaded may be confiscated. Those who are to be fined in accordance with the provisions of this law shall be dealt with by the collecting agency. Those who are to be criminally punished shall be immediately transferred to the court. The provisions of Articles 1 to 8 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations shall apply mutatis mutandis to the inspection, questioning, search, or seizure of matters relating to the evasion of goods tax. The Law on Punishing Private Salt shall be repealed from the date of implementation of this law. This law shall take effect from the date of promulgation. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - During the review of the Law on Penalties for Tax Evasion on Goods at the Legislative Yuan on the 10th, the members engaged in heated debates. The focus of the dispute was concentrated on two issues: the title and the prohibition of the Law on Punishing Private Salt. The principle drafted by the Central Political Council was to use the evasion of national taxes as the name of the crime, emphasizing intent. The review by the Finance and Criminal Law Committees of the Legislative Yuan resulted in the title of the bill being changed to the Law on Penalties for Evading Goods Tax. Some members of the Legislative Yuan believed this was inappropriate and insisted on restoring the term "evasion" to "tax evasion." As a result, the chairman put it to a vote, and the majority voted to change it back to "tax evasion." As for the article "The Law on Punishing Private Salt shall be repealed from the date of implementation of this law" included in this bill, some believed it was not in accordance with legislative practice. Ma Yinchu and others vehemently opposed it, saying that demanding the implementation of the new salt law was a consistent position of the Legislative Yuan. The Law on Punishing Private Salt was enacted specifically to protect the interests of salt merchants and was in conflict with the new salt law in many places. There are many types of goods, and salt is only one of them. If there is tax evasion, this law can be cited for punishment, and it seems unnecessary to have this separate law. As a result, Ma's proposal was unanimously approved. During the review of the Coinage Regulations, Huang Youchang stood up and questioned, saying that since the implementation of the new monetary policy had not gone through legislative procedures, this case should be discussed after the implementation of the new monetary policy case is ratified. Ma Yinchu stood up and replied that the decision to implement the new monetary policy was handled by the Emergency Committee on Financial Issues authorized by the Central Political Council. The members of the committee were Chiang Kai-shek, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, and President Sun of the Legislative Yuan. Although the procedure has not gone through legislative procedures, it has in fact been participated in by the highest leaders of the legislative authority. We should consider the current actual environmental needs of this case and review it immediately. As a result, it was unanimously passed without dissent. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>Nanjing - A spokesperson for the Ministry of Finance stated that the current shortage of copper coins on the market and the urgent need in various places, as well as the disorder of the current supplementary coins, which are easily manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, have made it necessary for the Ministry to request the government to formulate the Supplementary Coinage Regulations as soon as possible to serve as the basis for minting new supplementary coins. When the abolition of taels and the adoption of yuan was implemented in March of the 22nd year of the Republic of China as the basis for organizing the currency system, the supplementary coin situation was complicated and had to be stipulated separately, so it was not included in the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations. For several years, research has been conducted repeatedly, drawing on new systems from various countries and weighing the circumstances of the national economy and people's livelihood. A plan was carefully drafted based on the decimal principle. In addition, the director of the Minting Department of the Central Mint was dispatched to the Philadelphia Mint in the United States to supervise the casting of supplementary coin molds in order to facilitate minting. It was originally planned to be promulgated and implemented at the same time as the legal tender bill, but the molds took time to cast and could not be completed as scheduled. Now that the molds have all been cast and shipped one after another, they have been handed over to the Central Mint for trial minting, and the results are good. Minting has now officially begun and will soon be circulated on the market. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<h3 id="e23">The Issue of Japanese Currency Amidst the Improving Sino-Japanese Trade <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese trade has gradually returned to its former state in recent years. By way of example, the Japan Mail Steamship Company transported 345,900 tons of Japanese goods to Shanghai last year, an increase of 65% compared to the 215,430 tons in the previous two years (1933), nearly equivalent to the import volume of the year preceding the Shanghai War (1931). Given the similarities in customs and habits between the two countries, the development of trade should be a natural occurrence. However, the fact that the United States, Britain, and other countries still take precedence in China's foreign trade is attributed by some Japanese to the result of Chinese anti-Japanese sentiment. In our view, this is a flawed interpretation that reverses cause and effect. Chinese industry cannot compete with Japan and relies on the supply of Japanese industrial goods. Furthermore, Japanese goods can be sold at relatively low prices that align with the living standards of the average Chinese person. Japanese merchants also operate in a way that takes into account the convenience of Chinese customers in all aspects, such as setting prices in national currency rather than Japanese currency, which protects Chinese ordering merchants from the risks of exchange rate fluctuations. Their attitude towards people is also not as arrogant as that of Western merchants. Therefore, Chinese people should welcome Japanese goods and have no reason to be hostile towards them. However, the Japanese still do not understand the reasons for the Chinese people's dissatisfaction with Japan and continue to rely on coercion as a means to advance their goals. They may believe that this is the only way to increase exports to China, but they fail to recognize that, in addition to the quality of their goods, stores should also pay attention to the attitude of their staff in treating customers. If they display a "fierce" demeanor, even good products will be avoided. International trade is the same; there is no reason to force people to buy. Now, amidst the gradual improvement of Sino-Japanese trade, Japan continues to maintain its style. For example, the Japanese residents in Shanghai are even trying to further promote the use of Japanese currency, which is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Do Japanese residents not remember that the main customers of industry and commerce in Shanghai are still Chinese? If prices are set in Japanese currency, Chinese people will find it inconvenient to make purchases, and even Japanese stores will have the added burden of temporary currency conversions. If the intention is to avoid losses from Japanese exchange rate fluctuations, this could be considered a valid reason before the exchange rate was stabilized, but in today's era of foreign exchange controls, it is akin to worrying about something that is unlikely to happen. If they intend to circulate old-head tickets in the three northeastern provinces as an example, then it is even more illogical. The circulation of old-head tickets in South Manchuria is similar to the circulation of turnip tickets in North Manchuria, both of which are the result of the excessive issuance of bills and notes in the three provinces. Now that China's currency reform is neither a paper money policy nor inflation, Japanese currency has no chance to take advantage. Moreover, foreign merchant banks in Shanghai have also issued banknotes in Chinese currency, but how many of them are still in circulation today? This shows that although the Chinese are weak, they can love and use their own national currency and will not allow further economic encroachment. It is deeply hoped that the Japanese will abandon their narrow-minded and selfish views and open up today's frustrating situation from a position that benefits both themselves and others. Then, the development of Japanese trade with China will not be difficult to achieve and can leap to the forefront.</p>

<p>Moscow - Recently, several officers who defected from the Manchurian army crossed into Soviet territory. The details are as follows: On December 26, a Soviet border patrol detained a non-commissioned officer serving as an adjutant in a Manchurian guard unit near the village of Burutayev, northwest of Soviet territory. He carried a rifle, wore a Japanese military uniform, and was riding a horse near Burutayev and the Chinese village of Luzhuang, infiltrating Soviet territory. He claimed that he was unwilling to serve the Japanese and therefore entered Soviet territory. On December 31, in the Novoyelesiyevka district, one kilometer from the border within Soviet territory, Su Ren, a squad leader of the detachment, was also detained. When they were detained, they stated that the reason for crossing the border was to escape punishment from the Japanese. It is claimed that the Japanese were already aware of their anti-Japanese attitude and anti-Japanese actions. They claimed that they had participated in the intrusion into Soviet territory in the Novoyelesiyev district on December 12. On December 27, a Soviet border patrol detained a Chinese man in the Aigard Nokorsk area. He claimed to be surnamed Liu and named Haihe. He crossed into the Soviet Union from Manchuria. He claimed that he was the commander of the 1st Division of the Northeast People's Army and was conducting anti-Japanese Manchurian military operations. All of the above-mentioned personnel are imprisoned in the usual manner. (TASS dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<p>Moscow - Today, a Japanese military plane landed in the Pokrovka district. The location was 30 kilometers northwest of Voroshilov (Nikolsk-Ussuriysk), 35 kilometers from the Soviet border. The plane carried two armed Japanese, one of whom, after landing, immediately walked towards the road. He happened to encounter a farmer driving a cart, whom he tried to stop and force to walk to the landing site of the plane. The farmer fought back, and the result was that the Japanese man was detained. Now he is being transported by cart to Pokrovka. The Japanese man beat the farmer on the road. The two men fought fiercely. The farmer seized a knife from the Japanese man and stabbed him. He then drove the cart towards Pokrovka and pointed out the landing site of the Japanese plane to the border guards along the way. When the border guards were 100 meters from the plane, the other Japanese man opened fire on them. The border guards did not return fire and continued to approach the plane. The Japanese man then fired shots and attacked with a bayonet. The border guards then returned fire, and the Japanese man was wounded. The two wounded Japanese men were both sent to Pokrovka. Voroshilov immediately sent doctors to treat them. The case is currently under serious investigation. (TASS dispatch from the 10th)</p>

<p>Paris - According to a diplomatic correspondent for the newspaper L'Œuvre, some people in the British naval circles are now advocating the restoration of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, believing that since the United States is mired in an isolationist policy and has failed to advise on Far Eastern affairs, China and Japan can establish a general understanding themselves. Therefore, if the Anglo-Japanese Alliance can be restored, Britain's interests in China can be maintained, and even the position that Britain held in China before the war can be restored.

<h3 id="e36">The Naval Conference Will Establish a New Organization; The Five-Power Conference Will Expand to Six Powers <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>If Japan Withdraws, Russia and Germany Will Join; The Conference Will Again Hear the Japanese Representative's Arguments Next Monday; A Qualitative Limitation; Britain and the United States Have in Fact Reached a Compromise</p>
<p>London - The Five-Power Naval Conference will soon become a Six-Power Conference, with Japan withdrawing and Russia and Germany joining. Japan's withdrawal is now a widely recognized fact, but the date has not yet been determined because the Japanese representative, for the sake of prestige, wants to choose the date of withdrawal himself. It will probably be within a few days. The British delegation has accepted the Japanese side's request and decided to ask the conference on Monday to hear Japanese chief delegate Nagano's arguments on the common upper limit. At that time, Nagano will be asked to elaborate on concessions regarding adjustments based on the extent that they do not cause damage. Whether this situation can be extended to Monday depends on the attitude of other delegations. However, judging from the opinions of the delegations, most will announce their opposition to the common upper limit and end this situation. Therefore, the Japanese representative will inevitably withdraw from the conference. As a result, the naval conference will establish a new organization. Quantitative limitation is impossible without Japan's participation. Therefore, it is expected that the conference will focus on the following two points:</p>
<p>Re-discuss the plan for exchanging naval construction procedures in order to eliminate future secret suspicions in the relationship. Begin to implement qualitative restrictions. On this point, the British and American representatives have in fact agreed to limit the tonnage of battleships to 32,000 tons, rather than the 35,000 tons permitted by existing treaties.</p>
<p>It is expected that any agreement reached will contain the hope that Japan can join in the future. However, some delegations now have a feeling that a sliding scale clause should be inserted in the new treaty, so that signatory countries can expand this procedure without restriction when Japan builds ships.</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility of Russia and Germany joining the naval conference, British Secretary of the Admiralty Monsell already mentioned it in the House of Lords last November. Yesterday's talks between the British and Japanese representatives in the Foreign Office have already caused various rumors, but official circles have not acknowledged them. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Eden, in yesterday's talks, mentioned the text of the Mid-Pacific Defense Project in Washington and hinted at the possibility of Britain building forts in Hong Kong and the United States building forts in the Philippines. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>It is reported that the results of the discussions between the British and Japanese chief delegates to the naval conference last night led to the decision to conclude the London Naval Conference. At the plenary session on January 13, the representatives of the five major powers attending will be asked to approve the suspension resolution of the British and Japanese representatives. (Reuters dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>As a result of the private consultations between the British and Japanese representatives on the 9th, the British government can, after obtaining the consent of the delegations from the United States, France, and Italy, schedule a discussion on the Japanese proposal for a common maximum limit at the committee meeting on the 13th and intend to adopt it as soon as possible. However, as a result of the adoption, it will be defeated by a four-to-one situation, and the withdrawal of the Japanese delegation will be realized. In fact, the private consultations between Britain and Japan on the 9th have already decided on the general trend of the breakdown of the conference on the Japanese side. However, the Japanese plenipotentiary must request final instructions from the authorities in his home country in advance and intends to report the process and situation of the private consultations between Britain and Japan on the 10th and request instructions separately, so it is necessary to wait quietly for instructions. As for exercising the vote on the 13th, it is intended to avoid it as much as possible, so this vote is often held at the next decision-making meeting. From this point of view, the Japanese plenipotentiary will attend the meeting at most twice. (Domei News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>London - The remaining issue of the disarmament conference, which is on the verge of collapse, is how to conclude the conference in what form. It is expected that the delegates will propose the following declaration to conclude the conference: "Unfortunately, the disarmament conference has failed to reach an agreement and will wait for other opportunities to reconvene the conference. Before this, please countries to be cautious in rebuilding naval competition and strive to maintain friendly relations." (Electric Communication Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e37">Anglo-Japanese Private Talks; Britain is Willing to Accommodate Japan in Order to Leave Room for the Far East Issue <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>London - The Japanese delegation to the naval conference visited the British representatives at the Foreign Office at 4:30 PM today to discuss the situation of the naval conference. The talks ended at 6:30 PM. The spokesperson for the delegation then claimed that the meeting of the General Committee would be postponed. According to what our reporter knows, during today's talks, the Japanese representatives insisted that the quantitative restriction of the navy should be implemented by the common upper limit system and explained to the British representatives that if this issue cannot be resolved in a day, the country cannot continue to participate in all negotiations based on the exchange of naval construction program information. The British representatives replied that the issue of the common upper limit had been repeatedly discussed in the previous meetings, and all parties had exhausted their efforts but to no avail. If it is proposed again now and formally rejected by the countries, the naval conference will inevitably completely fail and must be cautious, etc. The Japanese representatives still insisted on their statement, saying that it is useless to continue negotiations if the issue of quantitative restrictions is not resolved in a day. As a result, Britain reluctantly agreed to change the agenda of the naval conference and re-propose the issue of the common upper limit for discussion, but solemnly stated that Britain's acceptance of this method does not contain the intention of granting naval equality rights to Japan. After the Anglo-Japanese talks were completed, Britain contacted the delegations from the United States, France, and Italy. It was decided that the General Committee would be postponed until Monday of next week, so that the delegations could have ample time to exchange opinions. According to what our reporter learned tonight, the delegations from the United States, France, and Italy will generally accept the change in the agenda. However, they believe that there is no hope of reaching an agreement on the common upper limit system. The American delegation does not want to bear the responsibility for the failure of the naval conference, so it will not oppose the method of changing the conference agenda. However, it is considered that it is unusual for Britain to accept Japan's requirements without any difficulty. In some respects, it is said that Britain is eager to avoid conflicts between Britain and Japan in order to reserve room for resolving various issues in the Far East in the future, so it is willing to accommodate Japan's requirements. According to what our reporter knows, people in British diplomatic circles have already requested the Ministry of the Admiralty to try to avoid a break with Japan, and even if the naval conference unfortunately fails, do not exclude Japan and continue negotiations with the United States, France, and Italy.

<p>London: Foreign Secretary Eden recently held a banquet at the Carlton Hotel to entertain the U.S. representatives attending the Naval Conference, namely, U.S. Undersecretary of State Norman Davis, along with other U.S. representatives, British representatives, and other dignitaries. It is generally believed that Eden has already informed the U.S. chief representative, Davis, of yesterday's meeting with Japan's Nagano and explained the reasons for Britain's agreement to Japan's request to re-discuss common maximum limits. Regarding Japan's request, which was once shelved years ago, it was rumored that Britain had given the U.S. representatives a promise not to consider it again in the future. The British authorities suddenly agreed yesterday to re-discuss the case, which surprised the U.S. delegation themselves. However, according to information obtained by our reporter, the U.S. delegation will still accept Britain's proposed changes to the agenda, so that the responsibility for the failure of the Naval Conference will be attributed to Japan. People in naval circles believe that Japan's move is due to the trend of Britain, the United States, France, and Italy forming a united front. Therefore, it re-proposed the issue of common maximum limits, hoping to create division. The British government is prepared to deal with this strategy of the Japanese delegation, and the joint method is for Britain, the United States, France, and Italy to jointly respond to Japan's request. The British government has also been in contact with the delegations of the United States, France, and Italy, and has not yet decided whether to temporarily delay or explicitly reject Japan's request.

<p>Paris: The Associated Press learned today from reliable non-official German sources that Germany considers the newly established military agreement between Britain and France to be very serious.

German leader Hitler may declare that this agreement violates the Treaty of London and may not agree to continue maintaining the demilitarized zone on the Rhine, so as to resist the French northern artillery line.

<p>Military Alliance to Protect Western Borders is Necessary</p>
<p>Cairo: The leader of the Egyptian National Party is paying closer attention to the actual difficulties due to the Italian-Abyssinian War, so the atmosphere of British-Egyptian relations has now improved. The British representative in Cairo, Miles Lampson, today made a clear statement to the Egyptian government that Britain is willing to sign the 1930 treaty in good faith. However, Lampson made another statement regarding military issues, because according to this treaty, 8,000 British troops are limited to the Canal Zone, which is far from sufficient to protect the western border from sudden attacks. Air attacks are more dangerous than land attacks. Unless Egypt has a sufficient air force, the British Air Force is indispensable for protecting the western border. Lampson also said that the expansion of the Egyptian army requires an expenditure of 15 million pounds and cannot be achieved in a short period of time. Therefore, a British-Egyptian military alliance is necessary for Egypt's own protection. (Reuters, 10th)</p>

The yuan price in November last year increased by only 12.5 percent compared to November of the previous year, which proves that the quantity and value of some export goods have increased. Items specifically mentioned in the imports were eggs, leather, cottonseed oil, sesame seeds, raw silk, silk cotton, and tungsten sand. U.S. imports from Shanghai in the first eleven months of 1935 were worth US$15,779,564, compared with US$10,594,694 during the same period in 1934. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Washington: It was learned here today that the Mexican government has begun to explore the attitude of Western Hemisphere silver-producing countries towards the International Silver Conference. It is understood that when the finance ministers of Mexico and the United States spoke, the United States expressed its intention to participate. As for whether Mexico has made the same proposal to the third largest silver-producing country in the Western Hemisphere, Canada, it is not yet certain today. However, this conference must have Canada's participation to have any hope of success. The most suitable country to initiate a silver conference is Mexico, because Mexico not only produces the most silver but also occupies a key position in North and South America. Officials at the U.S. State Department are unwilling to discuss this matter, but some Senate silver faction members said that they support this conference and hope that its results can prevent Britain from manipulating the international monetary system with its currency management policies. Some observers believe that although this conference has value, it is extremely difficult to convene, and it requires a great deal of preparation to succeed. However, as a result of current discussions, if it is decided to convene the conference in Mexico City, the United States is willing to participate. Doubts have been expressed here about Canada's attitude due to the recent victory of the Liberal Party. Officials do not know what attitude the Canadian Liberal Party will take towards general silver issues and the silver conference. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>

Ships in the English Channel and flights to and from the mainland have been temporarily suspended.

<p>London: Foreign Secretary Eden will depart for Geneva on January 19 to participate in the League of Nations Council meeting to be held on the 20th. Before departing, he will deliver a speech in his elected district of Leamington on the 17th. This is his first public foreign policy speech since taking office as Foreign Secretary. (Reuters, 9th) The League of Nations Committee of Eighteen is scheduled to meet in Geneva on the 20th of this month to discuss the oil embargo issue. It is unlikely to take a serious decision, or even postpone the decision again. The reason for this is that the U.S. Congress has not yet passed a new neutrality law to give President Roosevelt full power. In addition, even if the Committee of Eighteen wants to make a clear decision on the oil embargo issue, Britain will try to ease it. According to the U.S. proposal, the equal amount of oil exported to Italy in the past five years should be used as the basis to limit the export amount as a compromise. There are several reasons for this: As far as the situation in East Africa is concerned, Mussolini's plan to conquer Abyssinia may fail. However, Britain is still willing to maintain its original power in Europe and make peace with it. Japan's attitude at the Naval Conference is very tough. After the failure of the Naval Conference, its impact will inevitably extend to the Far East issue. Therefore, Britain is cautious about Italy. Germany's rearmament is on a large scale, and the British government has many concerns. In addition, someone rumored yesterday that Sweden intends to propose to the Committee of Eighteen to implement an oil embargo against Italy because Italian aircraft bombed a Swedish rescue team in Abyssinia. Swedish people here have now corrected this, saying that the country does not want to be suspected of retaliation and does not want to propose this method. Although the Soviet Union may propose an oil embargo, the country's ambassador to Britain, Maisky, did not show any signs of acting hastily when he spoke with Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday. From this point of view, the oil embargo issue will not cause major waves. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London: The League of Nations Committee of Eighteen is scheduled to meet on the 20th of this month to discuss the issue of an oil embargo. The U.S. attitude is very important in this matter. Although U.S. President Roosevelt made some announcements in his message to Congress on the 3rd of this month, he did not elaborate. According to the Daily Telegraph, the British and French governments are now planning to inquire about the true meaning of Roosevelt's speech so that they can be well-prepared before the Committee of Eighteen meets and be able to deal with it easily.

Harvard University Professor Bowser, originally an authority on international law and consulted by the government, declared that the new Neutrality Bill implements an arms embargo against belligerent countries, regardless of aggressor or victim. As a result, it only helps the strong and suppresses the weak, and the so-called neutrality has become nominal. Bowser also advocated that the United States should invoke the rights of neutral countries to maintain maritime freedom. In addition, Columbia University Professor Hyde also believes that the power granted to the president in this bill is too great. (Havas, 9th)</p>

There was also fierce fighting near Dolo. It is reported that both sides suffered heavy losses. It is now believed that the Abyssinian army has advanced several miles.

Countless weapons were captured, and a radio station was occupied. Gelaile is located on the Cheb Chiberi River.

According to other news received by Innsbruck, a large number of Tyrolean conscripts have fled across the border into Bavaria, Austria, and Yugoslavia. This news has also been denied by Roman officials, who said that border defenses are tight and that the high mountains are currently covered with snow, making them impassable to non-mountaineering experts. However, according to news from the Yugoslav capital, 2,000 Italian deserters are currently housed in Yugoslav barracks. The authorities are currently considering establishing concentration camps in Pusla and Bosnia. Recently, an Italian woman was detained and charged in Maribor in southern Yugoslavia for investigating the news of Italian soldiers deserting.

According to Abyssinian customs, every celestial change is a sign of God's anger, implying that the country is facing a tragedy of bloodshed.

According to customs, if the situation is favorable to the country, the lion seen must be quiet and peaceful. Last night, groups of people marched in the streets, shouting or singing, and when they arrived in front of the palace, they prayed in unison.

<p>Gold and Silver: London gold price today is 141 shillings exactly, slightly higher by half a penny.</p>
<p>London silver market today is quiet, spot prices unchanged, remaining at 20.5 pence. Indian purchases are in progress; speculators engage in both buying and selling.</p>
<p>Mount Isa Silver: Today, the Mount Isa silver market opened unchanged.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates: British-American: The US dollar price in the London foreign exchange market has stabilized this morning after the US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement yesterday denying further devaluation of the US dollar. At 10:30 AM, the British-American exchange rate was $4.944375, lower than yesterday's closing rate by 0.0005625. At 1:00 PM, it rose by 0.000125 to $4.945625.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat: New York Cotton: Although Liverpool cotton prices fell today, the New York cotton market did not fall at the opening. Instead, there were increases of several points, especially in the near term. The price then soared due to purchases by peers and speculators borrowing under the Bankhead Act to finance cotton purchases. After the price increase, the market stabilized with the January contract price at 5.81, down 11 points.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: The opening today was stable because Australia sold two batches of wheat to the Far East last night. Australian transporters are engaging in hedging to offset this. Although weekly shipments of wheat from around the world to the UK have increased significantly, the amount shipped to Liverpool for resale is not large, so it is still favorable to the bulls. At 1:00 PM, the March contract price rose by half a penny to 6 shillings 5.875 pence. The opening for miscellaneous grains was stable with a slight tendency to recover.</p>

After the opening, other stocks also rose slightly, with department stores, automobiles, and public utility stocks rising more. Later, there was a consistent upward trend.

<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Minister of Railways Zhang Jia'ao, after inspecting the PingSui Railway, boarded a special train at 8:15 AM on the 7th and returned to Fengtai, then transferred to Tianjin. He was accompanied by Chen Yanjiong, Director of the PingHan Railway Bureau, Yan Dedu, Director of the ZhengTai Railway Bureau, Shen Chang, Advisor to the Ministry of Railways, Yang Jizhi, Secretary, and others. Chen Juesheng, Director of the BeiNing Railway Bureau, Deputy Directors Xu Chengyu, Zheng Baozhao, Feng Hewu, Director of the Tianjin Office of the JinPu Railway Bureau, and Deputy Director Zhou Songyao boarded a special train at 7:00 AM and traveled to the Beicang Station to welcome him. Xiao Zhenying, the mayor of Tianjin, made a special trip to the station to greet Zhang. After disembarking, he went to the Palace Hotel on Zhongjie in the British Concession for rest. At 10:30 AM, he was invited by Chen Juesheng to inspect the BeiNing Railway Bureau, touring the various sections of the bureau. Chen gave a speech, and then gathered all the railway staff in the auditorium, inviting Zhang to speak. Zhang said that the BeiNing Line had the longest history among the national railways, and many of the bureau's staff were highly skilled. Since the September 18th Incident, the BeiNing Railway had suffered significant losses, and the environment was very harsh, yet it was still able to operate as usual. He said that the spirit of the employees was admirable and he hoped they would continue with the same spirit, working hard and diligently. Director Chen had been commissioned by Guo Mingling. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council and the Ministry of Railways were both Chinese government entities. The relationship between the BeiNing Railway and the Ministry of Railways remained unchanged. He urged everyone not to easily believe rumors, lest they be misled and it affect their work. After speaking, he left the bureau at 11:00 AM and went to visit the Ningyuan Garden. At 11:30 AM, he made a brief inspection of the Tianjin office of the JinPu Railway Bureau and then went to the Beiran Reception Center at No. 30 in the French Concession to attend a welcoming banquet hosted by Chen Juesheng. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Tianjin banking community held a tea party to welcome him at the Astor Hotel. At 7:00 PM, Xiao Zhenying hosted a dinner at the Dengyinglou Restaurant in the French Concession. At about 8:00 PM, Zhang, along with Shen Chang, Chen Yanjiong, and Chen Juesheng, went to the official residence of the Japanese Army Commander Tada in Zhangyuan, the Japanese Concession, to exchange views on the maintenance of traffic on the eastern section of the BeiNing Railway and the traffic on the various railways in North China. They spoke for about an hour before leaving. At about 6:00 AM on the 8th, he and Shen Chang, Chen Yanjiong, and others took off from the Dongjuzi Airport in Tianjin to meet Han Fuqu in Jinan. After staying for a day, they traveled to Qingdao on the 9th to inspect the Jiaoji Railway, and returned to Jinan on the 10th, before heading south. Inspections of the Zhengtai and Longhai Railways were canceled due to time constraints. The main purpose of Zhang's visit to the north was to meet with Song Zheyuan and Tada in the Tianjin area and to discuss methods to maintain transportation. Regarding the interception of railway funds from the Yutang stations by the pseudo-Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Government, Chen Juesheng was tasked with resolving the diplomatic difficulties and finding ways to stop it. However, it is still undetermined whether this matter will be negotiated separately or resolved as part of the entire Eastern Hebei issue. According to Secretary Yang Jizhi, who accompanied Minister Zhang, during this visit to the north, he visited Suiyuan and Datong, and inspected the PingSui Railway's operations. In the current situation in North China, the transportation of passengers and goods was surprisingly booming, which was truly commendable. The Minister was deeply impressed and sought to increase transportation capacity. The Minister also felt that the personnel arrangements were appropriate. As for how to reorganize the BeiNing Railway administration and the interception of railway funds by the pseudo-XinYu management office, which affected the overall revenue of the railway, the Minister received a telegram from the Ministry today, reporting that the stations east of Tangshan were being held up and the funds were being withheld. The original telegram was forwarded to Director Chen.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Situation in Guangdong's Commercial Market Approaching the Lunar New Year: Poor Performance Across All Sectors, Tight Credit; Request to Government to Improve Commercial Lending Methods <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: With the Lunar New Year approaching, Guangdong's commercial market traditionally settles accounts at the end of the year. However, the past year has been marked by widespread economic downturn and a bleak commercial environment. The situation is particularly dire for real estate and construction companies. Bankruptcies have been reported daily even before the twelfth month. In recent years, Guangzhou's land prices have plummeted, and there is little interest in the properties acquired. As the year ends, funds must be found to repay the debts, but the properties cannot be sold in a timely manner, resulting in numerous bankruptcies and the transfer of assets to creditors. As for the banking sector, commercial banks with strong deposits have benefited greatly from the government's announcement of currency management and the implementation of legal tender last year. Private banks with large cash reserves have also seen profits sufficient to offset losses from the first half of the year. However, most other businesses have seen poor performance and have collected profits in advance. Those who are barely managing feel an extreme shortage of funds. Although the government has recently introduced year-end commercial lending, the interest rates are slightly high and the repayment period is too short, leading to calls for revisions to the lending regulations. Therefore, the Guangzhou Industrial Associations has drafted an opinion and submitted it to the Provincial Government, requesting improvements to the lending methods. The association proposes the following six supplementary measures: 1. The original repayment period is limited to six months. It is proposed to divide it into two types: Type A, with the original six-month term, and Type B, extended by three months to nine months. 2. If borrowers deposit funds in the designated Provincial Bank account during the repayment period for the purpose of repaying the principal upon maturity, the bank should provide a monthly interest rate of 0.6% or 0.5% to show preference. 3. If borrowers sell the mortgaged property before the deadline and repay the loan early, they should be allowed a rebate on the interest at a rate of 0.6% or 0.5% to show special consideration. 4. If multiple businesses with separate licenses mortgage the same property to the Provincial Bank for loans, approval should be granted if the property is deemed adequate, in order to fulfill the purpose of assisting businesses. 5. Businesses that have previously taken out private loans that are about to expire should be allowed to refinance with the Provincial Bank. If the value of the mortgaged property is deemed sufficient, they should be allowed to increase the loan amount. If the mortgage has been transferred to the Land Bureau in accordance with the regulations, and the procedures are clear, re-publication in the newspaper should be waived to avoid complications. 6. For the issuance of Provincial Bank promissory notes, only 50 yuan and 100 yuan denominations should be issued to facilitate commercial transactions and reduce difficulties. It is best to reduce the monthly interest rate on the loan by 0.2% to 0.3%. (January 6)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Guangdong Industrial Bank Established, Total Capital of Five Million Yuan, Commenced Operations on the Sixth of This Month <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Industrial Bank has been in preparation for several months and was officially established on the fourth of this month. As the new headquarters is under construction, a temporary location has been selected at No. 70, Three-Entrance Alley, Yide Road (the former site of the Ri-Hwa Bank). The bank's operating staff has been transferred from the Municipal Bank. After its opening on the fourth, it was a Saturday holiday, and the following day was also a day of rest, so it officially commenced operations on the sixth. The bank has an authorized capital of five million yuan, jointly operated by the government and private investors. Government shares will be gradually allocated from the Provincial Government's revenue. It focuses on providing loans for provincial factories, land reclamation, water conservancy, and cooperative ventures. The head office is located in Guangzhou, and branch offices or representative offices will be established in counties and cities related to its business. If it is deemed necessary to issue banknotes, it may apply to the government for approval to do so. Of the annual profits, at least one-tenth of the total surplus will be allocated to the public reserve fund, and the remainder will be distributed as dividends to shareholders. Its main business operations include secured loans, with repayment terms ranging from three months to ten years, in installments, fixed terms, and revolving terms, secured by real estate or movable property. The mortgaged property is valued at no more than one-half of its market value, with first mortgages as the principle. Unsecured loans are provided to various cooperatives or public organizations after the bank's investigation confirms their creditworthiness, but the total amount of unsecured loans shall not exceed 10% of the total paid-up capital. Also, overdrafts shall not exceed 10% of the total paid-up capital. Regarding revenue collection, it conducts various savings and deposit operations. Its secondary business includes: Acting as an agent for property purchase, rental collection, and various trusts; Discounting various reliable bills of exchange and promissory notes; Various insurance businesses; and Various remittances. The bank's board of directors consists of 13 members, with 6 official members appointed by the government and the remaining 7 elected by private shareholders. The term of office is temporarily set at three years. The board of directors has five standing directors, elected by the directors from among themselves. The standing directors then elect one person as the chairman to carry out all business operations of the bank. In addition, the bank has one president and one vice president, appointed by the board of directors to handle all matters related to the bank's operations. (January 5)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Overview of the Daokou-Qinghua Railway in the Past Four Years - The Ministry of Railways Has Merged This Railway with the PingHan Railway <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Daokou-Qinghua Railway Administration recently released a report on the railway's operations in recent years. According to the report, although the plan to extend the railway line has been completed, it has not been implemented due to difficulty in raising funds. Now, in order to save expenses, the Ministry of Railways has merged this railway with the PingHan Railway, and it is hoped that the future development will be more secure. The report details the organization's activities in the past four years: Income: More than 1.57 million yuan in 1932, more than 1.67 million yuan in 1933, more than 1.79 million yuan in 1934, and more than 1.95 million yuan in 1935, an increase of more than 100,000 yuan each year. Expenditure: More than 1.38 million yuan in 1932, more than 1.44 million yuan in 1933, more than 1.47 million yuan in 1934, and more than 1.49 million yuan in 1935, an average increase of about 30,000 yuan each year. However, in 1921, the maintenance expenses were only more than 160,000 yuan. In 1932, this increased to more than 270,000 yuan, and in 1935, it increased to more than 290,000 yuan. It can be seen that road maintenance engineering is the main reason for the increase in expenditure. Debt Repayment: The railway has two debts, one being the 5% redemption loan, totaling 800,000 British pounds, and the other being the 7% rolling stock loan, totaling 126,838 British pounds 18 shillings 7 pence. Before 1925, principal and interest were paid annually. After 1925, due to the impact of military affairs, the principal and interest were not paid between the years of war. After Director Fan took office, the accumulated surplus from operations was used to repay a total of 24,846 pounds 19 shillings 4 pence in interest on the redemption loan, and a total of 24,384 pounds 9 shillings 1 pence in principal on the rolling stock loan. Negotiations were also held with the creditors to waive compound interest on the rolling stock loan of 16,983 pounds 14 shillings 5 pence, for a total reduction in debt burden of 66,215 pounds 2 shillings 10 pence, equivalent to more than 958,000 yuan in national currency. The Zhongfu Company still owes 600,000 yuan in freight charges this year. After allocating 300,000 yuan for freight charges to other railways, the remaining 300,000 yuan is sufficient to pay one installment of debt interest. Replacement of Sleepers: From 1926 to 1931, only more than 28,000 sleepers were replaced in six years. As of the spring of 1932, the number of damaged sleepers on the entire line reached more than 60%. Since 1932, maintenance expenses have been increased as much as possible. By the end of 1935, a total of more than 113,000 new sleepers had been replaced in four years. The roadbed is stable, and the speed of trains has also gradually increased. Increase in Rolling Stock: At the end of 1931, the railway had 125 freight cars, totaling 3,563 tons. Since 1932, cars scattered on other railways have been gradually recovered, and the Ministry of Railways has allocated new cars, increasing the total number of freight cars by 153, totaling 3,173 tons. The total number of freight cars is now 278, totaling 8,225 tons. In addition, three locomotives and six passenger cars and guard cars have been added. Business Improvement: 1. Passenger fares have been reduced from 1.7 cents per kilometer for third-class tickets to 1.5 cents per 100 kilometers. 2. First and second class passenger transport has been restored. 3. The railway has assumed responsibility for freight transport and joint transport. Savings in Materials: The railway's original material factory was separated from the material section. Since 1933, in order to save expenses and streamline procedures, the material factory has been merged into the material section. A new public system has been established for the purchase of materials, striving to purchase the most practical materials at the lowest prices. In the past four years, the prices of bulk materials such as bituminous coal, wood, and oil have been more than 70% lower compared to the prices of the same materials purchased previously, saving a total of more than 270,000 yuan in material costs. Afforestation Plan: The railway has approximately 340,000 sleepers on the entire line, which need to be replaced every six years. This requires the replacement of 40,000 new sleepers each year. Assuming that one 15-year-old elm tree can be used to make two sleepers, then 20,000 trees must be planted each year so that there will be enough sleepers in 15 years. Since 1932, the railway has been gradually afforesting according to this plan, creating 2,000 hectares of forest land in four years and planting a total of 497,000 trees of various sizes. Expansion Plan: In order to develop business and clear debts, the railway plans to extend the line from Daokou to Damingfu. Over the years, numerous studies have been conducted, and an estimate has been compiled for the extension of the line from Daokou to Damingfu, requiring 3.25 million yuan. In the summer of 1935, a survey team was organized to conduct on-site surveys and draw detailed route maps. Once the funds are raised, construction can begin. Other projects, such as the establishment of a library, an employee club, staff housing, a Daokou-Qinghua public cemetery, and the accumulation of 18,000 yuan in rebates from locomotive coal, are being used for the construction of an auditorium, the opening of a sports field, and the purchase of books. Significant progress has been made on all these fronts. The merger will not undermine the integrity of this railway line.</p>

<p>Before observing the extraordinary wartime finances, we must first examine the proportion of the so-called military expenditure, which is at the heart of the problem. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the recent surge in Japan's military expenditure and the enormous size of Japan's military expenditure compared to other imperialist countries in the world.</p>
<p>(From the "Asahi Yearbook," Showa 11th Year, page 153)</p>
<p>From the figures above, we can see that this year's budget (approved by the cabinet) has increased five and a half times compared to 1913, while revenue has only increased by three and nine-tenths. Moreover, the military expenditure mentioned here is limited to the direct expenses under the jurisdiction of the Army and Navy ministries. In addition, indirect military expenses, such as pensions for veterans, annuities, military bond expenses, youth corps training expenses, military education expenses, subsidies for military industries, military national highway expenses, ship improvement subsidies, aviation route construction expenses, expenses related to the Manchurian Incident and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, etc., if they are also included, then in reality it will "account for more than 80% of the total national budget" ("Social Review," September issue of this year, page 86). The main source of this enormous military expenditure, apart from the aforementioned scraping from the colonies, is deficit public bonds. Here, anyone with economic common sense can understand that a country's issuance of public bonds inevitably has a limit. Exceeding this limit will lead to the danger of malignant inflation or failure to pay public bond interest. In the past four years, Japan's national debt has increased sharply from 5.95 billion yen before September 1931 to 9.202 billion yen in August 1935, a sudden increase of more than 5 billion yen. If we also include the exchange rate difference of foreign debt, the total national debt should be more than 9.76 billion yen. So where did these more than 5 billion yen of public bonds come from? The problem is clear. The agricultural panic of recent years, the poverty of the general public, and the strain on the middle class have caused most of Japan's public bonds to be stored in bank vaults. At the end of 1931, the national debt in bank vaults was 1.811 billion yen, which had increased to 4.146 billion yen by the end of June 1935. In addition, there are 443 million yen of local bonds that have not yet been added.</p>
<p>The situation of the Deposit Bureau is even gloomier. In the past four years, the deposits of the Deposit Bureau have increased by 500 million yen to 3.2 billion yen. However, the national debt and local bonds held by the Deposit Bureau during these four years have surged to the extent shown in the third table:</p>
<p>Table 3: Bonds Held by the Deposit Bureau in the Past Four Years</p>
<p>(National Debt) (Local Debt) Total</p>
<p>September 1931 1,003 (million yen) 590 1,593</p>
<p>June 1935 1,717 950 2,667</p>
<p>In addition to national debt and local bonds, the Deposit Bureau also holds 855 million yen of semi-official enterprise bonds (such as the Hypothec Bank of Japan, the Industrial Bank of Japan, and others). Therefore, the total deposits are 3.2 billion yen, and the amount invested in government securities has reached 3.522 billion yen. In other words, even the reserve funds have been diverted.</p>
<p>The figures quoted above indicate that out of the total of 12.7 billion yen of national debt and local bonds, more than 8 billion yen is fixed in the vaults of financial institutions!</p>
<p>The fact that most of the public bonds are concentrated in financial institutions precisely indicates the narrow digestion capacity of Japan's public bonds and foreshadows that the digestion capacity of public bonds has reached the point of exhaustion. It also clearly illustrates the extent to which Japan's national power depends on financial capital.</p>
<p>The continued issuance of deficit public bonds has been felt to be significantly difficult, while the military expenditure of the "extraordinary times" is still expanding without limit. On the one hand, the agricultural panic has not only not eased but has become increasingly profound. Foreign trade has also gradually slowed down due to the saturation of exchange rate depreciation and the implementation of import restrictions by various countries. Under these strained circumstances, Finance Minister Takahashi, the general agent of the financial world, issued a statement saying, "If credit is destroyed by causing malignant inflation, then national defense cannot be consolidated at that time." From his standpoint, it can be said to be a very natural thing. He said, "It is better to have some preparation and leeway for emergencies." This sentence has a very deep implication. Once Japan goes to war with a foreign country (mainly, of course, the Soviet Union), the current situation is already different from the time of the Russo-Japanese War. The hope of borrowing from abroad is already very slim. Takahashi, who personally borrowed money in London at the time of the Russo-Japanese War, is very clear about this matter.</p>
<p>Two not very harmonious political forces: one is the military, which strongly advocates military adventurism, and the other is the financial capitalists who advocate gradual progress within the scope of national power. The conflict between these two forces has been the center of Japan's domestic political struggle since the London Naval Conference, and it is also the basis of Japan's so-called dual diplomacy. The political situation that unfolds every year with the budget issue as the center is only a superficial phenomenon of the struggle between these two forces.</p>
<p>Now let us take a look at the characteristics of the budget for the coming year (Showa 11th year, 1936). On the one hand, the main policies proposed by the Ministry of Finance are still: 1. Establishing a gradual reduction in deficit public bonds; and 2. Harmonizing national defense spending with general administrative expenses. On the other hand, the military authorities still put forward a request of 1.33 billion yen based on "the military's own view of the world situation." According to the original draft of the Ministry of Finance's budget (November 27th, "Tokyo Asahi Shimbun"), the total revenue for the coming year is 2.238 billion yen, an increase of only 23 million yen compared to this year's 2.215 billion yen (of which deficit public bonds are 666.8 million yen (a decrease of 104.8 million yen compared to this year's 771.6 million yen)); the total expenditure is 2.243 billion yen, of which military expenditure—489 million yen for the army (492 million yen this year) and 539 million yen for the navy (529 million yen this year)—a total of 1.0028 billion yen, already accounts for slightly less than 46 percent of the total expenditure, but it is still more than 310 million yen short of the military's request. As usual, the two military ministers put forward fierce revival requests. After a long period of so-called "political compromise" and a record-breaking all-night, twenty-one-hour cabinet meeting, the claim of "gradual reduction in deficit public bonds" was only superficially implemented, and a budget of 2.271 billion yen, including 1.05 billion yen of military expenditure, was established, unprecedented in Japanese history! The following Table 4 shows the outline of the budget for the coming year:</p>
<p>Table 4: Estimated Budget for Showa 11th Year (Unit: Million Yen)</p>
<p>1. Revenue (Ministry of Finance) (Cabinet Decision Amount) (Increase/Decrease)</p>
<p>Regular Department 1,448 1,450 2 (Increase)</p>
<p>Temporary Department 789 820 31 (Increase)</p>
<p>Including:</p>
<p>Ordinary Revenue 123 141 18 (Increase)</p>
<p>Public Bonds 666 680 14 (Increase)</p>
<p>Total 2,238 2,271 33 (Increase)</p>
<p>2. Expenditure</p>
<p>(Original Draft) (Decision Amount) (Increase/Decrease)</p>
<p>Imperial Household Expenses 45 45 0</p>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs 29 31 2 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Home Affairs 178 179 1 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance 494 490 4 (Decrease)</p>
<p>Ministry of the Army 489 508 19 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of the Navy 539 551 12 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Justice 39 39 0</p>
<p>Ministry of Education 141 142 1 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 89 90 1 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Commerce and Industry 16 19 3 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications 195 196 1 (Increase)</p>
<p>Ministry of Colonial Affairs 18 19 1 (Increase)</p>
<p>Total 2,243 2,272 29 (Increase)</p>
<p>From the figures above, we see that the deficit public bonds have been reduced from 770 million yen this year to 660 million yen, and it must be said that the Minister of Finance has implemented the claim of "gradual reduction." However, when we carefully analyze the reasons why public bonds can be gradually reduced, we can know that behind this optimistic "gradual reduction," there are still pessimistic causes hidden, and many artificial manipulations. First, the main reasons for reducing the deficit public bonds in the coming year are the following three: 1. Increased tax revenue; 2. Assistance from special accounts; and 3. The so-called "cooperative budget of various ministries" temporarily pieced together to break the deadlock between the military and financial authorities. Now, let us analyze one by one whether these reasons are solid and whether they have the possibility of continued existence.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Hubei Province Actively Carries Out Labor Relief to Repair People's Dikes. 3 Million Public Bonds Pledged for 1.2 Million Yuan. The Flood Relief Association Holds a Special Meeting to Discuss Distribution. <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After last year's flood, the authorities discussed relief to address the symptoms with urgent relief and agricultural relief, and to address the root cause with labor relief. Urgent agricultural relief has already been decided and implemented. As for labor relief, from autumn to winter, there has been no solution. The dikes that were breached by the flood in the entire province numbered four to five hundred, and the construction costs required silver tens of millions, which was beyond the ability of the authorities. Later, the Anhui labor plan was adopted, thinking of completing this major task with the service of the people. However, the dike breach areas are the most heavily affected areas. The disaster victims cannot survive without relief. It is not permissible to order complete compulsory service. Therefore, the Flood Relief Association allocated 400,000 yuan from the relief funds donated by various parties and distributed it to 34 cities and counties with the most severe disaster conditions, such as Songzi, Hanchuan, and Hanyang, and designated the most urgent dike repairs to start work first. At the same time, an appeal was made to the central government to subsidize a large amount of relief funds for labor relief. However, because the relief funds were too small, the counties did not distribute them. So far, after a month, no place has started work. The disaster victims are eagerly awaiting relief, still a pie in the sky. On the central government side, the Economic Committee initially reviewed and approved the allocation of 1.5 million yuan of labor relief bonds. A member, Wang Kaihua, was sent by the Flood Relief Association to receive them. The additional 1.5 million yuan of public bonds allocated by the Hubei Central Account Association has not yet been issued. The members of the Flood Relief Association have determined that this money will be used to repair people's dikes for labor relief and have pre-arranged with Finance Director Jia Shiyi to contact the banking syndicate for a pledge. Negotiations have already begun and it is said that 1.2 million yuan can be pledged. It is planned to sign the handover within this month and hand it over to the Flood Relief Association for proper distribution. The Flood Relief Association believes that labor relief is a fundamental work and everything should be carefully planned. A special meeting was specifically convened at 3 pm on the 11th to discuss the progress. It is thought that the labor relief problem, which has been delayed for a long time, will soon be resolved.

<h3 id="e86">Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou Troops Encircle Communist Bandits Fleeing in Guizhou. Guangxi Army Units Have Already Arrived at the Guizhou Border. The Border Anti-Bandit Headquarters Will Be Established. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Xiao He Communist bandits have recently been wandering between western Hunan and eastern Guizhou. In the Hongjiang Suining battle at the end of last month, they were pursued by the Hunan army's Fan Fengchi's troops and suffered heavy casualties. A part of the Communist bandits fled to the Guizhou border through Tongdao and took the road to Liping. On the 30th of last month, they fled to Tianzhu and then divided into San Sui Qingxi Jinping to invade. The Guizhou army's Gan Lichu's troops stationed in Qingxi immediately met them head-on and engaged in a fierce battle for three hours. The bandits relied on their strength and stubbornly resisted. On the 31st, another part fled to San Sui, attempting to contain the Guizhou army. Fortunately, the Guizhou army and De Pei's troops stationed there sent teams to outflank the bandits from the rear, resulting in hundreds of bandits killed and prisoners captured. At present, the Guizhou army has not only reinforced its troops to defend its territory but has also telegraphed the Hunan and Guangxi armies to enter the Guizhou border to encircle them. Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, the commander and deputy commander of the Guangxi army, were recently appointed by the central government as the commander and deputy commander of the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou border anti-bandit area. It is said that Li and others consider suppressing bandits and pacifying the people to be the long-cherished aspiration of the Guangxi army and will not shirk their responsibility. They are preparing to set up the anti-bandit headquarters for the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou border area near the Fourth Group Army headquarters in Nanning. As for the anti-bandit personnel, they will be concurrently filled by the staff of the Fourth Group Army headquarters to save expenses. It is planned to start work on the 15th of this month. Once the anti-bandit headquarters for the Hunan-Guangxi-Guizhou border area is established, a joint meeting will be telegraphed to the anti-bandit armies of various provinces to send representatives to discuss the overall plan to encircle the Xiao He Communist bandits in the three provinces, so as to fundamentally eliminate them and avoid future troubles. It is expected that the date of the large-scale encirclement by the armies of the three provinces will be realized in the latter half of this month. (January 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e87">Recent Situation in Kulun: The Ruling Authorities Are the Mongolian Youth Faction; Russians Have Freedom of Movement in the Territory. <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence: Recently, someone who returned to Zhangjiakou from Kulun spoke about the general situation there, stating that after the interruption of transportation between Zhangjiakou and Kulun, trade between the two sides was disrupted and Zhangjiakou was greatly affected, resulting in a depressed scene. As a result, the number of businesses that closed down was countless. Although China and Russia resumed diplomatic relations, there was still no hope of smooth trade and it was mostly manipulated by foreigners. It was difficult to restore the old outlook. Since the tenth year of the Republic of China, the ruling authorities in Kulun have been the Mongolian youth faction, most of whom have studied in Russia. They have made improvements in administration, customs, construction, and education. However, their various measures are mostly imitated from Russia. Regarding transportation, there is a military airfield near Kulun, which is quite large. Groups of airplanes often fly in the sky for training. There are more than three thousand cars in the city, constantly traveling back and forth on the Ri-Cha-Ku (Chakhtu) road, making transportation fairly convenient. The municipal situation has made significant progress compared to before. Buildings are lined up, the roads are flat and clean, and electric lights and telephones are readily available. However, agriculture is not prosperous and there is a shortage of food. The local wheat is black in color and expensive, and the supply cannot meet the demand. If it is transported from Russia and the three northeastern provinces, the distance is long and the freight is high. All other daily necessities rely on external supply, so there is no possibility of reducing the cost of living for the people. As for the thousands of miles of land, they are all pastures, with herds of cattle and sheep in large numbers. The population is mostly Mongolian and Han, followed by Russians. Due to environmental factors, Mongolians and Hans must be proficient in Russian. Hans who operate businesses in the area have mostly become small workers since the tenth year of the Republic of China. They must carry work permits to work, which must be renewed every year. Due to various harsh treatments, many Hans abandon their businesses and take the opportunity to escape secretly. Moreover, Hans entering the country are also strictly prohibited. Therefore, the number of Hans in the area has decreased by more than half compared to ten years ago. However, Russians can come and go as they please and many are workers. This is the recent situation in Kulun.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Anhui Province, Guizhi Dong San Counties: Post-War Reconstruction in the Border Areas, the Province Sends Personnel to Train the Militia Corps <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Anqing Dispatch: Previously, due to the bandit atmosphere still raging in the border areas of Guichi, Zhide, Dongliu, and other counties in Anhui Province, the provincial government dispatched the Security Director, Hui Ji, to supervise the suppression. Later, Hui reported that the remaining bandits had been completely suppressed and drafted several post-war reconstruction proposals, which were signed and sent to the Provincial Government for review by the Department of Civil Affairs. Now, the Department of Civil Affairs, recognizing the deep and immense suffering of the people in the recovered bandit areas, is actively organizing militia corps to defend them. However, merely organizing without training, lacking knowledge of defense methods and combat, is practically useless. It is proposed that the recovered areas of Guizhi Dong San Counties select two military trainers for each district to specialize in training these militia corps. In addition to military skills, they will also teach general knowledge, ensuring everyone recognizes the correct political path and establishing a foundation for people to enlist in military training. The goal is to achieve effectiveness in two months, and if successful, extend it to neighboring counties and other districts, so that the same education and progress can be achieved, and they can connect with each other as a whole defense plan. Then, the tranquility of the border areas of the three counties can be expected to last permanently. As for these trainers, it is proposed to provide each person with a living allowance of 30 yuan per month. Considering the wider bandit area in Guichi, it is proposed to send four trainers, two to Zhide, and two to Dongliu, requiring a total of eight trainers. The total cost for two months will be 480 yuan. It is proposed that this expense be covered from the anti-banditry funds or the unspent budget for martial arts instructors in the local defense teams of the county. Furthermore, regarding the firearms needed by the militia corps, in addition to each district raising funds to purchase them independently, it is also requested that the Eighth District Special Commissioner be ordered to send all collected discarded firearms to the province for repair, and each district will pay the repair costs to claim and use them. After inspecting the old, discarded Lee-Enfield rifles stored in the Provincial Armory, it was found that 300 of them can still be repaired. Leaving them discarded like this risks decay. If they are issued to the people to guard the blockhouses, it seems that their strength can be slightly increased. It is proposed to repair them all at once, and order each district to pay a certain amount of repair material costs to claim and use them. The gunpowder needed is still abundant in the armory's storage, and it can also be ordered to be purchased in appropriate quantities. The above methods have already been signed and submitted to the Provincial Government for review in a meeting. (January 5th)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Financial Department Committee Member Arrives in Songjiang to Withdraw Funds</p>
<p>Chen Qixiang, a specially appointed secretary of the Department of Finance, arrived in Songjiang in a private car from Shanghai at noon today, to visit the county magistrate. However, the county magistrate was out on official business, and the section chief was also attending a meeting elsewhere, so they did not meet. Secretary Shen Zongliang received him. The mission to Songjiang was to withdraw 120,000 yuan in taxes for the 24th year. However, since the second installment of taxes for the 24th year had not yet been collected, which was indeed the case, the funds could not be obtained for the time being. Committee Member Chen excused himself and went to Shixian County to discuss official business.</p>
<p>Changshu: Automobile on the Xihu Road Injures a Person</p>
<p>He Zhangshi, the wife of He Yongfu, a farmer from Zhangjiaba, Hongqiao Township, Second District, went to the city to pay rent at noon on the 6th. While walking along the Yinhu Highway, she was unexpectedly run over and killed by a car heading west from Shanghai near Bridge No. 43 in Guli Village, her head shattered, the scene was extremely tragic. The woman had originally intended to take a boat to the city, but changed her mind to walk due to a headache. Unexpectedly, she became a ghost under the wheels. After the accident, the car fled westward. When the station received the news, the pursuit was too late. According to eyewitnesses, the car was a new streamlined car with paint, Shanghai license number 1136, Beijing Market number 13. After the county government received the report, it sent personnel to the township for inspection on the morning of the 7th, instructing the family to collect the body and wait for the vehicle that caused the accident to be found before further investigation. It is reported that the woman was 47 years old and had a husband and many children at home. She is said to be the first person to die after the opening of the Xihu Highway.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Lake Bandits Continuously Rob Manshan Village</p>
<p>Manshan in Guangfu Township is isolated in the middle of Taihu Lake. The mountain has three villages: Nanshan, Beishan, and Zhongcun, with over 100 households who live by farming. Because the land is located in Taihu Lake and the defenses are weak, theft cases occur from time to time. Unexpectedly, at dawn on the 7th, three bandit boats suddenly arrived at the mountain, carrying more than 30 lake bandits. Their clothes were mixed, some wearing old uniforms, and most held firearms. After climbing the mountain and firing shots as a show of force, they began to rob. Because there were no stationed troops in the township, they did whatever they wanted, searching house by house. It is estimated that they robbed for about two hours, looting a total of seventeen farmhouses in the three villages before leaving, fully loaded. The mountain is quite far from Guangfu Town, so the district office and others did not hear about it until the 10th, when the mountain town office reported it to the district office, which in turn reported it to the county government, requesting the arrest of the bandits. County Magistrate Wu paid close attention to this case. In addition to immediately ordering the security team to rush to search and arrest the lake bandits, he also ordered the Public Security Bureau to have the detective team investigate closely. If there are no clues, a joint suppression will be carried out to maintain security. It was also learned that the Sun family, a farmer living along the edge of Taihu Lake behind Dengwei Mountain in Guangfu Township, was robbed by bandits on the night of the 9th, with minor losses. The bandits escaped into Taihu Lake.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Murderer in Third District Arrested</p>
<p>Chen Agou, a resident of Shenjiawan Township, 64th Tu, Third District, was brutally beaten by his neighbor Chen Afo on April 12th of last year and died from his injuries. At that time, the murderer fled in fear of punishment. The court issued an arrest warrant with a reward of 50 yuan. The reason for Chen Agou's death was that Chen Afo was having an affair with Shen Meisheng's wife, who lived next door. On that day, Chen Afo went to Shen's house for a secret meeting, which was discovered by Chen Agou, who shouted "Catch the adulterer!" As a result, he was severely beaten by Afo and died from his injuries. Recently, Afo, believing that the matter had passed, secretly returned to his hometown. Someone reported this to Zhong Jihe, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, requesting his arrest. After receiving the report, Captain Zhong ordered detective Luo Shaoqing to go to the countryside to arrest him the day before yesterday. He successfully arrested Afo and transferred him to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he was transferred to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Wuxi Road to First Operate the Wuxi Section</p>
<p>Wang Baosheng and others from Wuyi had previously initiated the organization of the Wujiao Road Long-Distance Bus Company, which was submitted to the county government for approval and contract signing, and the deposit of a guarantee fund was required in order to start construction. Later, they received an order from the Construction Department to change the name to Wuxi Road, and representatives should be sent to contact the county government. The company originally planned a capital of 100,000 yuan, temporarily raising a share capital of 50,000 yuan, with half of it subscribed by the initiators. A board of directors, supervisors, and managers were appointed, and it was decided to first operate the Wujin to Henglin section, which was submitted to the county for record on the 9th in order to proceed soon and operate the buses.</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Setting Up an Agricultural Warehouse in Youchegang</p>
<p>Since the pawnshops in Wangjiangjing, Nanhui, and other places in Jiaxing were closed, the villagers near Youchegang felt quite inconvenient for pawning and other matters. Now, merchants Chen Jingxian, Ni Beipian, and others in Youchegang have raised 2,500 silver dollars and deposited them in the County Farmers Bank as a fund for establishing the Youchegang Agricultural Warehouse. They have obtained the consent of Shen Xianheng, the manager of the Agricultural Bank, and appointed Yang Zaihao as the director of the Youchegang Agricultural Warehouse. The Chen family mansion in Gangnan was selected as the warehouse site and officially opened on the 7th. Each person is limited to mortgaging two dan of grain, which is very convenient for poor farmers. Over two hundred refugees who have difficulty with the county arrived at the Shen family ancestral hall in Yangmiao Town on the 8th, relying on violence to occupy it and piling up rice straw like a mountain in hopes of lighting a fire for warmth. This was discovered by the Shen family, who intervened with the refugees. However, the refugee leader Zhang Jinhuo refused to intervene and ordered the use of force, with a threatening posture. Even more barbaric refugees used burning rice straw to randomly burn the beams and pillars. The Shen family urgently telegraphed the County Police Brigade and the Fourth Public Security Bureau of Tianning to send police to drive them out of the area.</p>
<p>Nantong: Dongsheng Police Team Repels Bandits</p>
<p>Bandits are rampant in the area of Dongsheng in the east of Tongyi. The security team went to suppress them. The bandits stubbornly resisted, injuring one police officer. After a heavy blow from the team, the bandits retreated north, capturing bandit criminals Huang Xu and others, as well as the bandit woman Huang, a widow, and they were handed over to the District Security Command for interrogation on the 9th.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: County Government Changes the Field Tax System</p>
<p>After the land declaration in this county was completed, the county government was ordered to completely reform the field tax for the 24th year. Based on the results of the land declaration, the procedures for checking and listing were complicated, resulting in delays in the collection period. Now, the first and second installments of field tax will be collected at the same time to remedy this. However, this is the beginning of land reform in Jiangdu, and all systems have been changed. Hereby, special regulations are made for matters that should be noted, and notices are issued to all districts. It is also learned that the county government has scheduled a meeting of district chiefs at 10:00 AM on the 10th to discuss methods for urging and completing payments. Furthermore, all districts are ordered to summon township and village chiefs in advance and gather them at their respective district offices by 10:00 AM on the 13th to be trained. It is rumored that the county government will also send personnel to attend and instruct everything at that time.</p>
<p>Gaoyou: Long-Distance Bus Overturns into Canal – Ten People Drowned in Unprecedented Tragedy</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Highway Administration's Qing (Jiang) Yang (Zhou) long-distance bus, passenger car No. Su-1208, left Qingjiang on the 6th. At around 2:00 PM, while traveling on the Yun embankment outside Fengshen Temple Qigong Palace north of this county, the driver was careless, and one of the wheels fell off, causing the car to overturn into the canal, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. For a time, the whole city was shocked, and over ten thousand people watched. After the accident, 16 passengers (including two women who broke the car windows to escape) were rescued, avoiding the disaster. Later, eight dead passengers were salvaged, and two others were missing. They were carried to Qigong Palace. At around 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, the county government's adjudicator, En Pei, led the coroner and clerk to conduct an inspection and prepared coffins for collection and burial. Li Zhengshu, a staff member of the Second Section of the County Government, was visiting relatives in Huai'an during his annual leave and was returning to Youyou on this bus. He tragically died. The others were surnamed Sun (from Hebei, Huai'an), Jiang Ruizhi, Yin Yisan (both cloth merchants), Zhuang Zian (residing in Lianshui City, former chairman of the Lianshui Chamber of Commerce five years ago), Du Huan (serving in the Tax Police Corps), and the names of the remaining two people are unknown. This car had a total of 26 passengers. Among those who escaped were two assistants from the Sixth Technology Department of the Aviation Committee, one being Yan Mengqin (from Shanghai, 27 years old) and the other being Cheng Yong (from Anhui Province, 30 years old. When escaping, his head hit the car window glass and he suffered abrasions to the head and went to Datong Hospital for treatment, his life is safe). Ma Jingxuan, an employee of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council (from Huaiyin, 39 years old), Chen Daoqing, a soldier from the Nanjing Training Headquarters (from Siyang), Fei Xiushan (a businessman from Shiying, 24 years old), and 14 others, as well as two women, one old and one young. After escaping, everyone went to the nearby Tubakou Bathhouse to warm up and change clothes, as their clothes were completely wet. The driver and co-driver of the car, Chuan Xingfa, have been arrested and sent to the county government for handling. In addition to the damage to the car, the clothing and banknotes of the passengers were lost. The wrecked car has been raised out of the water, but has not yet been brought ashore.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Zhejiang Highway Bureau Implements Austerity</p>
<p>The newly appointed Director of the Highway Bureau, Jiang Jia_, went to the bureau at 9:00 AM on the 10th to take over. After Deputy Director Li Yu completed the handover, Jiang issued a special order to appropriately merge the management offices of each district for the sake of implementing austerity. Five districts were merged into four districts, and the business offices were merged into one district. Unfinished highway projects, such as the Jiahu Road, Lishan Road, and Yongrui Pingdeng Road, are planned to be continued, and staff will be appropriately reduced to cut expenses.

<p>Ningbo: Hefeng Yarn Factory Announces Closure</p>
<p>The Hefeng Yarn Factory in Jiangdong, Ningbo, stopped production on the 1st of this month. It was originally planned to resume production in the short term. Now, due to prolonged rainy weather and difficulty in collecting raw materials, the factory has officially announced its closure. The workers, believing that the factory's closure without reason is related to their livelihoods, have elected representatives to request the factory to maintain the agreement mediated by the Party and government agencies in September of last year and continue operations until the end of the Lunar New Year. Otherwise, they will return 10% of the wages deducted during peacetime. The factory did not accept this request, and the union has submitted the case to the Party Headquarters and the government for mediation.</p>
<p>Xiaoshan: Extended Hours for Qianjiang Ferry</p>
<p>The Qianjiang Ferry is an important route for counties in eastern Zhejiang. Recently, the Yugan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been completed and will soon be fully operational.

<p>Funing: Dispute over First Prize in Aviation Lottery</p>
<p>Sun Yangting, Hu Cunfeng, Xia Shoukun, and Pei Fenggang, partners of the Hengyu Silk Shop in Yilin Town, and four partners of the Shixing Oil Mill in the town each contributed one yuan to purchase eight tickets for the 13th aviation lottery from Shanghai, stating that the prize money would be distributed proportionally. Unexpectedly, Sun Yangting returned to his hometown of Jiancheng due to a matter and did not return for a while. Pei Fenggang then copied the lottery ticket numbers and sent them to Sun Yangting. After the draw, the first prize was 233781, which matched the copied number. Sun, seeing that he had won the prize, immediately returned to town to negotiate with Pei and others. However, Pei and others had privately exchanged the winning ticket and firmly denied it. Sun filed a lawsuit with the county government, which opened a trial on the 5th. Adjudicator Gao questioned them one by one, ordering the defendant Pei Fenggang to pay a deposit of 3,000 yuan and Hu Cunfeng to pay a store deposit, and to wait for the investigation before further investigation.</p>
<p>Education Broadcast Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e92">Trends in Normal School Education (Middle) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Daozhi, Director of the Department of Education, Central University</p>
<p>The modern teacher training institutions in our country can be traced back to the Regulations on Schools issued in the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu (1901 AD). Among them, normal schools "to train primary school teachers" were attached to middle schools, with a four-year study period. By the twenty-ninth year of Guangxu, the elementary normal schools in the Regulations on Schools were designated as independently established, with a five-year study period. In the first year of the Republic of China, the school system was revised, stipulating that the study period for normal schools was one year of preliminary training and four years of undergraduate studies, one year more than ordinary middle schools. Until the promulgation of the School System Reform Plan in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, our country's normal school system was largely modeled after Japan; normal school students' education began in elementary school, passed through higher elementary school, and then entered normal school. A detailed examination of this school system, directly imitated from Japan, actually takes the French system as its original model.</p>
<p>The current structure of the school system was completed in the School System Reform Plan of the eleventh year of the Republic of China. The organization of the primary and secondary school stages imitated the so-called six-three-three system in the United States; the duration of secondary education was extended, and the level of normal schools also increased accordingly. They were either established as normal departments of senior high schools or as six-year single-setting normal schools, but they could also be established independently for two or three years, accepting graduates from junior high schools (three or four years). After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, there were no major changes in the school system. However, the Interim Regulations on Middle Schools promulgated by the University Council in March of the seventeenth year stipulated that senior high schools should have general, normal, and vocational departments, and the independently established normal schools lost their legal basis. It was not until the Normal School Law promulgated by the National Government in December of the twenty-first year that they regained their statutory independent status.</p>
<p>According to the current Normal School Law, normal schools accept junior high school graduates for a three-year study period and may also establish "special normal departments" for senior high school graduates for a one-year study period. The so-called special normal department is actually the second part of the regular department of the normal school in the school system of the early Republic of China, which was originally modeled after Japan. According to the current system, the level of normal schools is comparable to that of senior high schools, and senior high schools are evolved from higher schools and university preparatory courses. It can be seen that since the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the status of normal schools in the school system has obviously been raised compared to before, but it has always been confined to the secondary education stage. Its duration (including the combined number of years of prior education and normal education) is slightly longer than that of the Soviet Union, comparable to that of France and Italy, but it is already below the general standards of the United States, and it feels "far behind" compared to the training colleges in the United Kingdom. As for comparing it with the current German system of teacher colleges and the university training departments in the United Kingdom, it is even more beyond reach.</p>
<p>In addition, the current normal schools have added so-called simplified normal schools and simplified normal departments. The entrance qualification for the former is elementary school graduation, with a four-year study period, and the entrance qualification for the latter is junior high school graduation, with a one-year study period. Considering that modern teacher education in various countries strives to raise the level of education and enrich the content of training, this kind of simplified normal school seems to be only a temporary setting "for the sake of urgently training teachers for compulsory education."</p>
<p>Judging from the situation in all aspects, it is neither possible nor necessary to raise the level of normal schools in our country at present. Among the modern countries with the highest level of teacher education, the first is the United Kingdom and Germany. This is because the duration of their primary education is longer (5 to 14 years in the UK, 6 to 14 years in Germany), so their teachers need a longer period of preparation. Our primary schools are six years, and the compulsory education period is only four years; the teachers who will be needed the most in the future will naturally be for elementary schools, and the teachers trained by the current normal school system are already more than competent.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and Germany have now implemented training elementary school teachers in universities or in independently established educational institutions at the university level. Education experts in France also advocate abolishing the current normal schools and having all future elementary school teachers receive one year of professional training in universities after completing full secondary school. The motivation for this kind of advocacy is only partly to broaden the knowledge of elementary school teachers; most of it is to raise the social status of elementary school teachers. In various countries, the demand to raise the status of teacher training institutions to the same level as universities mostly comes from the advocacy of education experts. Their intention is to break through the fortress of this traditional class education, correct the general prejudice that elementary school teachers are merely "teaching craftsmen," and advance them to the professional status similar to doctors, lawyers, and engineers. However, in our country, all primary schools from the beginning were not exclusively set up for the lower classes of society like European primary schools, so the teacher education system does not have the function of maintaining the current social class division. The normal school system in our country has similar points to the current French system on the surface, but it is actually different. Normal school students in our country generally need to go through the junior high school education stage, which is different from the fact that most French normal school students come from higher elementary schools and do not go through middle schools. Moreover, normal school students in our country have more opportunities to enter universities, so the normal education system itself is not completely isolated from the outside world, and it can avoid becoming the education institution of a certain specific class in society. This is a merit of the normal school system in our country that is worth preserving.</p>
<p>In the preceding paragraphs, I have given a general comparative explanation of the historical origins of teacher education, its social functions, and the teacher education systems of modern countries and our country. From the actual practice of teacher education in various countries, we can discover several key points that its entire spirit embodies. I will now describe them one by one as far as my personal views allow.</p>
<p>Teacher education from the beginning has been a powerful means to promote national cultural policy.</p>
<p>In European countries, the history of normal education is shorter than that of secondary and university education. When it was founded, it had clear national purposes. The French Revolution, launched in 1789, saw the importance of teacher education from the beginning by its revolutionary leaders. In 1794, it had already begun to create exemplary normal schools in Paris, ordering students to be selected from all over the country to enroll, so that in the future, each could return to their original place to run the same teacher training institutions. Napoleon had a deep understanding of the importance of teachers. In 1805, he said: "Education can be said to be the most important of all political issues; there can never be a stable political country without a group of professors who uphold definite beliefs." He had already seen clearly that the foundation of a nation-state lies in a common culture, a common belief, and a common ideal, and that teacher training is the root of everything.</p>
<p>After Prussia was conquered by Napoleon, its philosopher Fichte gave a "Speech to the German Nation" in Berlin in the seasons from 1807 to 1808. He believed that the key to the political regeneration of the German nation lies in moral and spiritual revival; he believed that a new generation of citizens must be cultivated through new education; this group of children should be allowed to run their own common life, completely isolated from adults except for a few teachers, so as not to be corrupted by their deeds. Although Fichte did not put forward a specific teacher training plan, the importance of teachers has been fully expressed in a few words. In the early nineteenth century, the Prussian government made extremely resolute efforts in teacher training. It is generally recognized that Prussia's establishment of teacher colleges created teachers who were thoroughly trained and full of professional enthusiasm, and they were worthy of being pioneers among modern countries. It is an unquestionable fact that the people trained by these teachers were the main force in the German national revival movement.</p>
<p>The normal schools in France were set up to cultivate citizens suitable for the new regime after the revolution, and the normal colleges in Germany were the creations in the movement to save the nation from danger; both are enough to show that the emergence of the modern teacher training system comes with great national purposes. If we only regard normal schools as places to train teachers, then we will have overlooked the greater significance!</p>

<h3 id="e93">Song Ziwen's Remarks Yesterday on the Sino-Japanese Problem: The Silence of the People Represents a Deep Understanding of the Government's Difficulties; Friendly Relations Should Not Be Discussed Before Relations are on the Right Track <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Our reporter visited Song Ziwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Council and chairman of the Bank of China, yesterday to inquire about the Bank of China's business situation last year and future plans. According to him, the Bank of China has a significant responsibility to society, considering the interests of the general public, and assisting the government in improving financial policies. Since taking office, he has been cautiously proceeding with this approach. Fortunately, thanks to the efforts of colleagues and the trust of society, deposits have increased significantly. The year-end settlement showed a surplus of four million yuan, with two million four hundred thousand yuan in official interest and over one million yuan in accumulated public reserve. New business plans for this year are currently under detailed discussion. He is currently preparing a detailed business report for last year to be presented at the shareholders' meeting this spring. When the reporter inquired about his views on the Sino-Japanese problem, Song replied that the recent tense pressure in North China has caused unbearable pain to our people. Except for the patriotic expressions of the young intellectual class, the rest remain silent. This is not the passive silence of the people, but a deep understanding of the government's difficulties. In the extremely dark situation in North China, they still hope to find a way to restore relations between the two countries to a normal track. Finally, the reporter asked about his thoughts on Sino-Japanese friendship. Song pondered for a moment and replied that when relations between the two countries have not yet entered a normal track, the word "friendship" seems rather difficult to explain. At this point, guests arrived one after another, and the reporter took his leave.</p>

<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Those who attended yesterday included Zhang Yichen, Liu Zhongying, Zheng Dongshan, Ge Futian, Wang Xiaolai, Li Aokui, Chen Jiufeng, Hu Fengxiang, Wei Langxuan, Qiu Jialiang, Luo Zheng, Ren Nongxuan, Zheng Xiaolin, Zheng Jianbo, Wang Manyun, Lu Wenzhong, Xu Boliang, Yu Yaoqiu, Shao Xubai, Xiao Tuizhi, Gu Wensheng, Ye Jiaxing, Mao Yun, Sun Choucheng, Zhu Zhichun, and others, totaling over twenty people.

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the meeting began as scheduled, Chairman Wang Manyun reported, stating that Shanghai is the premier commercial port in East Asia, and various industries are very developed. However, the global economic downturn has affected the port, causing the market to decline and become depressed. The Shanghai Telephone Company, ignoring the market situation, is using the tool of communication to make arbitrary decisions as an enterprise. First, it used the excuse of losses to request a price increase, but failed. Then, it changed its approach, using the beautiful name of billing by call to achieve its purpose of increasing prices. In order to take into account the actual situation, the affordability of the citizens, and to restore the original prosperity, he hopes that all attendees will offer their opinions to find a solution. Society would be fortunate, and the citizens would be fortunate.</p>

<p>Important Cases Resolved</p>
<p>1.

<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, due to the agreement between the First Special District Court of this city and the concession, opium cases are still adjudicated according to the opium crime clauses of the Criminal Code. The Anti-Opium and Anti-Drug Regulations are ineffective in the concession. It is learned that Guo Yun'guan, President of the First Special District Court, has consulted with the concession authorities several times and has decided that from now on, when opium and drug cases are uncovered in the concession, the prosecution will be based on the Anti-Opium Regulations promulgated by the Director-General of Anti-Opium. However, the point in the regulations that opium and drug cases should be subject to military trial will not be applied in the concession for the time being. They must be handled as ordinary criminal cases according to the statutory procedures of the three-level three-trial system. It is also learned that the implementation date has been agreed upon by President Guo and the Public Works Department and will begin today (the 11th). Therefore, from now on, opium smokers residing in the International Settlement will also be severely punished if arrested.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Bureau of Social Affairs and Bureau of Public Health Yesterday Hosted Representatives from Designated Hospitals to Discuss Methods for Investigating Injured and Sick Workers, Aiming to Commence on February 1st <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs and the Bureau of Public Health, for the sake of protecting the health of laborers and promoting industrial economy, are jointly organizing a worker injury and illness investigation. To promote this effort, they specially hosted representatives from the designated hospitals of the bureau yesterday afternoon at the YMCA in Ba Xian Qiao, engaging in detailed discussions. Attendees included Zhang Ziyan from Shanghai Hospital, Shen Fusheng from the First and Second Hospitals of the Chinese Red Cross Society, Sheng Qingcheng from Hudong Hospital, Lu Yingen from Sacred Heart Hospital, Yan Peizhang from the Wusong District Health Office, Wang Shiwei from the Bureau of Public Health, and Tian Heqing, Wang Lianyu, Shen Risheng, and Jiang Zhiyong from the Bureau of Social Affairs. Chaired by Tian Heqing, the chairman first reported the purpose of the gathering, stating that the city has many factories, and many workers are injured or suffer from various occupational diseases due to their work in these factories. However, factories often conceal and fail to report such incidents, making investigations very difficult. In light of this, the bureau has drafted measures for investigating worker injuries and illnesses in order to promote this work. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>*   Select several larger hospitals in the city as designated hospitals to assist in this investigation.</p>
<p>*   Invite those responsible for the designated hospitals to a tea party to discuss the implementation of the project together.</p>
<p>*   Draft two report forms, one for "Worker Injury" and one for "Occupational Disease," to solicit opinions from those responsible for the hospitals and to determine the final form of the two tables.</p>
<p>*   The above two record forms will be printed as postal card types and distributed to the designated hospitals and other major hospitals.</p>
<p>*   Request each designated hospital to designate one person from its existing staff to be responsible for filling out the forms. If a worker is injured or ill and seeks treatment, the form should be filled out promptly and mailed to the bureau. If a worker is seriously injured, the Bureau of Social Affairs should be notified immediately by telephone so that staff can be dispatched to the factory for investigation.</p>
<p>*   The bureau will provide appropriate remuneration to the form fillers mentioned above.</p>
<p>*   The designated hospitals are tentatively set as follows: Shanghai Hospital, Binlong Hospital, Hudong Hospital, Renji Hospital, Guangci Hospital, Pudong Hospital, Wusong Health Practice Area, Sacred Heart Hospital, Orthopedic Hospital, Shanghai Labor Hospital, Shanghai Public Assistance Hospital, the First Hospital of the Red Cross, and the Second Hospital of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>The discussion then began, and the measures proposed by the Bureau of Social Affairs were accepted one by one. Finally, Chairman Tian announced that the bureau would do its best to carry out this work and hoped that it could begin on February 1st. Afterwards, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>China's shipping industry has been severely affected by the overall economic downturn. Only the cooperative lines can barely sustain operations. The Shipping Guild is seeking to save the industry. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guild Seeks to Save Industry</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Council of the China Shipping Cooperative Society originally intended to establish shipping business offices in the Yangtze River, coastal, and inland ports to handle shipping cooperation matters. However, due to the inability of state-owned and private enterprises to fully cooperate, private director Yu Qiaqing resigned in anger, leading to the suspension of council affairs and the cessation of the implementation of concrete cooperation plans. Currently, only the various shipping companies belonging to the six routes of Taipei, Shentai, Shensha, Huyong, Yangtze River, and Tongyang have independently carried out cooperation and can barely sustain operations. The remaining routes are extremely declining. The Shipping Guild has resolved to increase freight rates by 20% across the board and is currently seeking to implement this separately in an effort to save the declining shipping industry.</p>
<p>Cooperation on Various Lines Takes Effect</p>
<p>Shentai Line: Shanghai to Taizhou. The cooperators are Taizhou, Zhoushan, Chuanshan, Daxing, Pingan, and other five shipping companies, jointly leasing the Lian'an Shipping Bureau. Shentai Line: Shanghai to Pingyang. The cooperators are Ruian, Hixing, Daxing, Zhejiang, and other four shipping companies, organizing the Shenping United Bureau. Shensha Line: Shanghai to Qidong. The cooperators are Sanbei, Yuxing, Jufeng, Binji, Pingan, Dada, Daxing, Maoli, and other seven shipping companies. Tongyang Line: Shanghai to Yangzhou. The cooperators are Dada and Datong, two shipping companies. Huyong Line: Shanghai to Ningbo. The cooperators are China Merchants, Taikoo, Sanbei, and Ningshao, four shipping companies. Yangtze River Line: Shanghai to Hankou and Yichang. The cooperators are China Merchants, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Sanbei, Ningshao, and Nissin, six shipping companies. Since the cooperation of the above six routes, they have been able to barely sustain operations during this time of decline in various industries, especially the Tongyang and Huyong lines, which are the best. This proves that the effectiveness of cooperation cannot be ignored.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, which had previously telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to lodge a strong protest against the planned issuance of banknotes in Shanghai by the Japanese Bridge Company on December 30th of last year, as reported in this newspaper, has now learned that the association has received instructions from the Ministry of Industry under Commerce Letter No. 40346, stating, "We have received the telegram and have reported the matter to the Ministry of Finance for verification and handling. We will issue further instructions upon receipt of a reply. Please be informed." This instruction is from Minister Wu Dingchang.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Rent Reduction Committee Petitions Executive Yuan to Promptly Instruct Shanghai to Reassess Land Prices to Facilitate Rent Reduction <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, in order to request that the central government reassess land prices in accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth National Congress in order to facilitate rent reduction, yesterday specially petitioned Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan to promptly instruct such reassessment. The original petition stated, "Regarding the petition to promptly instruct the Shanghai authorities to reassess land prices in order to facilitate rent reduction:</p>
<p>Our country's economic decline has reached its extreme today. The rural economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, and urban commerce is also declining daily. The prosperous Shanghai is no longer what it once was. In addition, the January 28th Incident completely damaged its vitality. Its surface prosperity masks its actual emptiness. During this time of chaos and famine, those in power and those out of power are unable to seek revitalization in order to recover. The only fundamental relief lies in increasing income and reducing expenditure, and increasing income is best achieved through self-reliance, while reducing expenditure is most important through reducing rent. Based on this humble view, we previously presented a petition to the Fifth National Congress, which resolved to refer it to the responsible authorities for verification and handling. However, after much anticipation, no formal document has been issued.</p>
<p>Although the association has repeatedly appealed loudly, the result is that for every foot of progress, the forces of obstruction grow by ten feet, and the results are meager. What is the situation of real estate today, and what is its trend? Failure to reduce rent will make it impossible to seek revitalization, a fact that is already obvious in the market. Land prices exceeding actual value are a major obstacle to reducing rent. In the golden age when real estate was increasing daily, the authorities frequently assessed prices at any time. Today's real estate situation is very different from the past, but we have not yet heard of the authorities taking action to reassess land prices in accordance with reality.</p>
<p>Your Excellency presides over the central government and is concerned about the people's livelihood. You will not ignore this issue, which concerns the entire social livelihood. Therefore, we have described the situation below.</p>
<p>Please, considering the decline of Shanghai's commerce and the crisis in the social economy, promptly order the Shanghai authorities to implement a reassessment of land prices, so that rent can also be reduced accordingly. More than three million people are looking forward to it. This is respectfully submitted for your consideration. To the President of the Executive Yuan."</p>

<p>Ma Chijun and others, tenants of Zhongbei Gongyi Lane on Menggu Road, Zhabei, suffering from high rents due to the impact of the current situation, obtained the consent of all the tenants in the previous year and organized a Rent Reduction Branch, submitting it to the Shanghai Zhabei District Rent Reduction Committee and joining as members, starting a campaign to reduce rent and alleviate the burden on all the tenants in the lane. After repeated negotiations with the owner, Sun Lianfang, the owner, agreed to a rent reduction, charging 87.5% of the original rent based on the rent reduction amount of Nan Gongyi Lane, starting from November of last year. All the tenants in the lane are satisfied, and the rent reduction matter can be said to be concluded. It is heard that the branch has been approved for registration by the district committee, and all expenses should be borne equally by each member, with the district-issued branch seal as proof when collecting the fees.</p>

<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the large-scale Central Machinery Manufacturing Factory, which the Ministry of Industry is constructing in Beixinjing, has completed 70-80% of the building portion since construction began on New Year's Day of last year. According to the reporter's inquiry with the factory's preparatory office yesterday, the factory is currently actively installing machinery at the same time. If there are no obstacles, it is expected to be completed by the end of this month. In addition, the steel casting and iron casting plants are expected to be completed soon. However, the installation of internal parts will take quite some time. The official date of production should be in June of this year. In addition, the factory invited bids in Shanghai last month for the construction of the engineering test building and the seamless tube factory. The bids were opened a few days ago and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. Once approved, it will be decided which company will undertake the construction and begin work immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Request for Correction: Business Tax Bureau Sets Up Card to Intercept Ships, Essentially a Disguised Form of Old Tax, State Formulates Tax Law <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, stating, "To the esteemed Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 8th of this month, we received a letter from the Lacquer Industry Association stating that since the government eliminated and reformed taxes and established the Business Tax Bureau in Laohekou Town, Guanghua County, Hubei Province, several years have passed without incident. However, since the newly appointed Director Gu Shan took over, he has changed the ministry's regulations, setting up sentry posts and cards, ordering all buying houses to report and register when transporting goods down the river and inspecting documents. Furthermore, passing merchant ships must also pay taxes before being allowed to pass. All ships, both upstream and downstream, are detained, and forced to pay taxes and make up for taxes, resulting in various difficulties and exactions for merchants and inconvenience for merchants. Transactions throughout the town have been halted. After repeated consultations and discussions on relief measures by the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Tax Bureau ultimately did not take them into consideration and abolish the ship cards. Under duress, they had to write to your association for assistance. Upon approval, we checked that our firms have been sending water passengers to Laohekou Town to handle raw lacquer for many years. Now that the Business Tax Bureau has set up sentry posts and cards, it is particularly disadvantageous for the water passengers. It is appropriate to call out in unison. We specially write to your association to examine and approve, and promptly transfer it to the Ministry of Finance, ordering the Hubei Provincial Department of Finance to strictly order the Laohekou Town Business Bureau to abolish the ship cards in order to relieve merchants from their difficulties. It would be a virtuous deed. We learned that the collection of business tax is legally aimed at commercial firms, with business capital or business income as the tax base. Stores operate according to regulations, and there are accounts to check. There is no reason to set up cards along the way and check the goods. According to reports, the Laohekou Business Tax Bureau's handling is essentially a disguised form of the old tax. Although the state has formulated a business tax law, the handling of business tax by various provinces often differs from the law. The general merchants often resent that the elimination and reformation of taxes has only been a few years, and the old ways have reappeared. The associations report to the department and cable to the respected department to correct them. It is not only Hubei Province. As the saying goes, 'Block the small streams, and they will become rivers.' It seems that such malpractices are emerging daily and should be rectified early. It is appropriate to report the situation to the respected department for examination and approval, humbly requesting you to quickly inform the Hubei Department of Finance and strictly order the bureau to abolish the sentry posts and cards and stop intercepting ships and checking goods along the way in order to maintain the tax law and for the sake of fairness. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3 id="e119">American Tea Association Concerned about Packaging of Chinese Tea, Inspection Bureau Has Paid Close Attention <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau previously discovered that many tea chests from tea merchants exporting tea did not have paper lining in the lead shells, resulting in lead mixing in from time to time, hindering hygiene. It had sent a letter to the Tea Industry Association to inform various tea merchants and published a notice in the newspaper. Since then, various tea merchants must line the tea with thick paper between the tea leaves and the lead shell when packing the tea in order to emphasize hygiene. The bureau recently received a letter from the American Tea Association, expressing considerable dissatisfaction with the poor packaging of Chinese exported tea and requesting that measures be taken to improve it as soon as possible. After receiving the letter, the bureau found that the packaging of tea coming to Shanghai for inspection from Anhui and Zhejiang was generally strong, but the packaging of black tea from Hubei was indeed extremely poor and easily broken. Those shipped to Europe and the United States also had the same shortcomings. It was found that this type of tea chest mostly came from Hankou and was transshipped in Shanghai. Although it is not within the scope of the bureau's inspection, since the American Tea Association has made this statement, it should pay close attention to improvement. Therefore, it sent a reply to the American Tea Association to thank them and planned to forward it to the Ministry of Industry for review and approval and send letters to the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Municipal Tea Merchants Association for attention. The translated text of the original letter from the American Tea Association is attached below for the common viewing of tea merchants in various places. (The following is a transcription of the letter from the American Tea Association)</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau: We are writing to you as we have read the "Inspection Administration and Commerce Monthly" and are greatly impressed by your bureau's enthusiasm for the promotion of Chinese tea. However, there is one important issue that your bureau may not have considered. In order to express our assistance and cooperation, we are specially raising it for your attention. The poor packaging of your country's exported tea is undoubtedly the worst of all kinds of goods imported into the United States. This is indeed an important obstacle to the development of trade. Since the regulation that paper must be lined between the lead shell and the tea leaves, most of your packagers or tea producers have used inferior paper to stuff the shells. This inferior paper quickly breaks into pieces and mixes into the tea, which must then be removed, which is very troublesome and uneconomical. The tea chests themselves are also not strong and cannot withstand the hardships of long-distance transportation. Moreover, each chest now contains 70-75 pounds of black tea. All of these are true facts. Most merchants shipping Chinese tea to the United States are trying to reinforce the tea chests with iron hoops. Although this has a considerable effect, it cannot completely solve this difficulty. For several years, exporters have used triangular wooden strips nailed to the four corners inside the tea chests to increase support. However, based on experience, we deeply feel that this method cannot make the weak and unsecured poorly made tea chests strong. This kind of private effort to improve the packaging of Chinese tea has been going on for many years, but it has no effect. Therefore, our association has reported the above facts, hoping that your bureau can formally pay attention to them. Our association knows that your bureau's business lies in the entire Chinese industry, but tea is one of China's earliest and largest industries. Our association hopes that this letter can arouse your bureau's deepest consideration. Our association is the only representative of various tea industry groups in the United States. Our association is willing to cooperate with your bureau to correct this fundamentally important event. Your bureau may already know that the International Tea Promotion Committee has begun to promote its teas produced in Ceylon, India, Java, and Sumatra in the United States.

The original letter from the company to the Mining Association is excerpted below: "Mr. Ding Zaijun of Taixian County is the leader of the geological community in our country, with profound knowledge and extensive writings. He recently inspected coal mines in Hengyang, Hunan, and died of coal poisoning on the 6th of this month at Xiangya Hospital in Changsha. The news of his death shocked the whole country. Mr. Ding, who was not yet fifty years old, dedicated his life to geological research, enduring hardship and toil. His direct and indirect benefits to our mining industry are great and significant. In order to commemorate Mr. Ding and encourage future generations, our company requests that your association initiate a memorial method, funded by fundraising from various mines, so that Mr. Ding's spirit of dedication to academic research will be passed on permanently. Our company will commit 2,000 dollars to initiate the effort.

<h3 id="e128">Dispute Over Eight Pieces of Jewelry - Comprador Accused of Fraud - Wang Xiaobiao Denies Purchase - Sang Quan San Can Only Sue - Whereabouts of Jewelry Urgently Need to Be Investigated <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiaoliang, a Ningbo native also known as Shenghe, who works as a comprador at Hongsheng Foreign Firm at No. 40 Ningbo Road in this city, has recently, for unknown reasons, incurred the resentment of others, resulting in a villain throwing feces at him. However, the perpetrator escaped on the spot and has not yet been caught. Unexpectedly, misfortune does not come alone, and unpleasant events follow one after another. Recently, Sang Quan San, a Ningbo native residing at No. 5, Lane 217, Tongfu Road, who is engaged in military uniform business, suddenly sued Wang in the First Special District Court for fraud. Previously, Sang Quan San had a friend named Xu Zhiliang who mortgaged eight pieces of jewelry worth several tens of thousands of yuan to him, with an agreed redemption period. However, Xu was unable to redeem them on time, and Sang Quan San confiscated them according to the agreement. However, Xu Zhiliang's jewelry was originally borrowed from Xu's younger sister for mortgage. Since he was unable to redeem them, he naturally often quarreled with his brother, demanding the return of the original items. However, Xu was ultimately unable to raise the money and failed to return the pearl to its rightful owner. Around June of last year, Wang Xiaoliang, a comprador from Hongsheng Foreign Firm who was familiar with Xu's sister, suddenly visited Sang's residence. Since they were not acquainted with each other, Chen Shanrong, the manager of Xinchang Woolen Store, introduced them. Soon after, the two parties discussed the jewelry, and Wang expressed his intention to purchase it. After both parties agreed, the price was set at 21,000 yuan. Wang said that he would pay 5,000 yuan in foreign currency within one or two days, and the remaining amount would be paid in full upon delivery of the jewelry. On June 12th of last year, Sang delivered the eight pieces of jewelry to Wang at Hongsheng Foreign Firm. However, Wang suddenly said that he could not raise the full amount at the moment and could only pay 4,333 yuan first, with the remaining amount to be paid on the 14th. At that time, Sang believed that Wang Xiaoliang was a comprador and had always kept his promises, so he agreed without hesitation and did not ask for any written evidence. Who knew that from then on, Wang repeatedly postponed the agreement. At first, Sang thought that he was unable to raise the money in time, but after repeated urging, Wang denied purchasing the jewelry, saying that the jewelry was mortgaged to Sang by Xu Zhiliang. Since Xu was unable to redeem it, he had paid more than 4,300 yuan to redeem it on Xu's behalf, and that he had already returned the precious items to Xu's sister. Therefore, a dispute arose between the two parties. Although intermediaries mediated several times, it was difficult to resolve the dispute. Sang had no choice but to retain lawyer Chen Rui to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Wang Xiaoliang of fraud, and attached a civil suit, demanding that he be ordered to return the eight pieces of jewelry. This case was once tried by Judge Dai Rongduo, who instructed them to wait for a rescheduled joint trial. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the continued hearing. Because the original judge Dai was on leave due to illness, the case was reassigned to Judge Yang Guanchang of the Ninth Court. After a hearing, they were again instructed to wait for a rescheduled trial.</p>

<p>Room 622 on the 6th floor of the Hamilton Mansion at No. 170 Jiangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, is rented by a Western woman named Miller. Miller is only 24 years old and usually has a very peaceful demeanor and only associates with proper people. Unexpectedly, at around 10:30 AM yesterday, Miller suddenly swallowed sleeping pills in her room and committed suicide. When the building attendant entered the room to clean, she was discovered. It was found that she was barely breathing and her complexion was purplish-blue. Greatly shocked, the attendant immediately telegraphed the Central Police Station to send a car to rush her to the General Hospital for treatment. Due to the deep poisoning, her condition is extremely critical. The police station has started investigating the cause.</p>

<p>The Taihe Xiaoyan Paper Store in Zhangjiazhai, west of Hongzhen East Xiao Wang Temple in East Shanghai, is opened by Chen Shitai (25 years old) from Chongming. He employs an apprentice, Chen Heshang, 17 years old, also from Chongming. At around 7:00 PM last night, while they were having dinner, six or seven bandits suddenly arrived. Two bandits stood guard at the door, while the remaining bandits rushed into the shop, threatening and intimidating the shop owner and others. Coincidentally, the fifth group of the Xiao Wu Temple security regiment, which was assigned to the area by instructor Gong, was patrolling nearby. When they reached the entrance of the Taihe Tobacco and Paper Store, they noticed two people looking around. The two security guards suspected their behavior and ordered them to stop. After a thorough search, they found an iron bar about a foot long. They were then detained in the security post for strict questioning. According to the report, there were several other people robbing the shop. Instructor Gong personally led several security guards to pursue and capture them, but the bandits had already escaped with the stolen goods. However, shop owner Chen Shitai and apprentice Chen Heshang were both injured by knives, groaning on the ground, bleeding profusely. Chen's abdomen was severely injured, and his large intestine protruded, making his condition very serious. Heshang's chest was injured, but fortunately, it was minor. Later, the security guards hired a car to send them to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The police station in charge is tracking down the escaped bandits. As of 9:00 PM, two bandits had been arrested and were being interrogated separately.</p>

<p>Wei Songfeng (also known as) Zhongxiu, a native of Zhenjiang who once served as a division commander, along with Dong Yinxuan and Wu Acai, both from Ningbo, and Zhang Xixiang, from Tongzhou, were arrested by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Public Concession Police Station at No. 3 An'nafang, An'na Road, No. 23 Lixianli, East Zilaihuo Street, and No. 160, Beihutang Road, Pudong, for committing serious crimes. Wei and the others were apprehended along with two pistols and fifteen rounds of ammunition, and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted them under Article 187 of the Criminal Law. Court President Feng Shide announced the verdict, sentencing Wei Zhongxiu, Dong Yinxuan, and Zhang Xixiang to two years of imprisonment each, and Wu Acai to one year of imprisonment. The pistols and ammunition were confiscated. The Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office sent a letter requesting that they be transferred for further investigation. After the investigation is completed, they will be sent back for execution. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Bouncing Checks Used to Defraud Goods - Amounting to More Than 74,000 Yuan - Yu Chunlin Wanted, Chen Qingyu Released on Bail <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yu Chunlin and Chen Qingyu, both from Ningbo, opened Xieyuan Shenzhuang at No. 13 Qinghefang, Guangdong Road. In September of last year, they successively purchased goods from 89 merchants, including the Greater Shanghai Rubber Factory, Zhongnan Woolen Mill, Hualun National Goods Store, Datong Industrial Company, and Huacheng National Goods Store, amounting to 74,658 yuan, one cent, and five li. On November 10th, they issued checks to the merchants with a date of 25 days. However, on the 23rd of that month, Yu Chunlin suddenly fled without a trace, and all the checks issued could not be cashed. After investigation by the merchants, it was discovered that Yu had already mortgaged all the goods to the Salt Industry Bank for a loan. The merchants then realized they had been deceived and jointly retained lawyer Tong Yuwen to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court against Yu Chunlin and Chen Qingyu for fraud, requesting that they be punished according to Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and attached a civil suit, demanding that they be ordered to repay the plaintiffs the price of the goods, 74,658 yuan, one cent, and five li. The First Special Court approved the request and issued summonses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Fifth Criminal Court for trial. Yu Chunlin was on the run and could not be summoned. Only Chen Qingyu surrendered and claimed that he was formerly Yu's apprentice. After completing his apprenticeship, he was promoted to accountant. Yu Chunlin operated many businesses, and Xieyuan was originally opened as a partnership by three people. Only in the 24th year did Yu operate it solely. He had no prior knowledge of Yu's departure, and all matters were done by Yu, and he was only an accountant. Upon hearing Chen's defense, the plaintiffs insisted that Chen was also one of the shareholders. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Zhan, he ordered them to wait for a rescheduled trial. Yu Chunlin was wanted for issuing the checks. Chen was released on bail. The civil suit was first transferred to the Civil Court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Record of Continued Trial of Salmon Smuggling Case - Court Retrieves Customs Signature Certificate - Defendants Still Released on Original Bail for Retrial <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>In the autumn of last year, Zhu Xusheng, Zhao Lianfang, Chang Junfa, and others jointly filed a self-report with the Local Court Prosecutor's Office, accusing Xianyu merchants Zhenchang, Weng Zhaofang, Zheng Yunsheng, Zhang Benhua, Ye Zhenqin, and others of stealing salmon shipped from Soviet Russia by fraudulent means, amounting to more than 6,700 dan worth more than 70,000 yuan. Zhu Xusheng and others stated that the theft was a minor matter, but it harmed national tax revenue and was not a trivial matter. Fearing that they would be jointly suspected if the matter came to light, they had no choice but to come forward and report themselves. After the court received the report, Prosecutor Xiao Jinying investigated and verified the facts, and ordered Ye Zhenchang, Weng Zhaofang, and others to be released on bail and prosecuted under Article 339, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wu Deying conducted several trials, but the case was not concluded due to its complexity. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that this case was continued by Judge Wu at 3:00 PM yesterday. The plaintiffs Zhu Xusheng and others retained lawyer Zhu Ya Kui to appear in court and present their case. The defendant Ye Zhenchang retained lawyer Zhang Shizhao to appear in court and defend him. First, Ye Zhenchang testified that he was 36 years old, a native of Zhenhai, and the manager of Zhen Da Company. He denied any fraudulent activities. After the interrogator examined Ye Zhenchang's account books and the two customs signature certificates, he found a discrepancy of 134,452 pounds. The interrogator then instructed Ye Zhenchang to submit another customs signature certificate and the original certificate from the American Mellingden Public Firm (i.e., the weigher) for verification. Next, Weng Zhaofang testified that he was 53 years old, a native of Ningbo, and a street vendor at Jieshun Fish Shop on Xianyugua Street outside Xiaodongmen. Zheng Yunsheng testified that he was 41 years old, a native of Ningbo, and the manager of Shengji Fish Shop at the 16th Pier. The remaining testimonies were evasive. At this point, lawyer Zhu Ya Kui stated that the court should pay attention to the fact that the Xianyu Industry Market Price Maintenance Association was a legitimate organization. However, the defendants were very organized in their salmon smuggling and had meeting minutes that could prove it. The meeting minutes were stored at Xu Runsheng's, the manager of the Xiemao Fruit Shop at the intersection of Dongmen Road, 16th Pier. He requested that the court retrieve the minutes, which would make the inside story clearer. Recently, the defendant Ye Zhenchang and others, fearing that the situation would escalate, had begged Huang Zhensheng, the general manager of the Ice Fresh Association, to mediate with the informants Zhu Xusheng and others, with Ye and others offering 350 yuan to instruct Zhu Xusheng and others not to appear in court. At that time, Zhu Xusheng and others refused. He requested that the court order Huang Zhensheng to appear in court to clarify the truth about the mediation. The interrogator stated that the case still needed to be testified. On the one hand, he strictly instructed Ye Zhenchang to submit the customs signature certificate and the original certificate from the American Mellingden Foreign Firm at the next hearing. Ye replied that it would be difficult to submit the case and requested that an official document be issued so that he could obtain it. The interrogator did not allow it. The defendants were still released on their original bail, and then the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The Funing Shipping Co., Ltd., which operates the Shanghai-Fujian route, failed in business in May of last year. The person in charge of the company appointed lawyer Sun Zhongyao (34 years old, native of Wuxi, joined the Shanghai Bar Association in April of the 22nd year, and has an office on the second floor of No. 39 Shouduya Road, formerly a bookkeeper) to liquidate the company's accounts. Later, disputes arose with the company's shareholders, Chen Yongyuan, et al., over the disposal of the company's property. The two parties were involved in litigation in the First Special Court, which has not yet concluded. Recently, Zhuang Wenpei (also known as Qiupei, 42 years old, native of Hui'an, Fujian, currently residing at the Tai'an Inn on Minguo Road), a Xiamen native from the Funing Shipping Co., Ltd., retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court on December 31st of last year, accusing Sun Zhongyao of obstructing freedom and requesting an investigation. According to the complaint, the plaintiff came to Shanghai from Fujian and was staying in Room 74 of the Tai'an Inn, handling miscellaneous affairs, and was planning to return to Fujian. At 11:00 AM yesterday, the defendant led several people to search arbitrarily and forced him to go with them. The plaintiff refused to go because he did not speak the language. After the defendant summoned Ye Qinghua from Xiamen Bank to translate, he had no choice but to follow. They took the defendant's car to a large building, which was said to be a police station. He was forced to sign before he could regain his freedom. Ye Qinghua (37 years old, Xiamen native, manager of the bank at No. 11 Tianzhutang Street) was also present as a witness. After receiving the complaint, the court, led by Judge Xiong Huiping, conducted a hearing at the Second Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff and his representative lawyer arrived at the court and stated the intent of the lawsuit. It was stated in the Min dialect, and it was unclear what they meant. Only that the other party pointed at the defendant saying they called four or five people to pull me out, and even forced me to the police station and executed it. The witness can be the tea boy at the Tai'an Inn. When the defendant Sun Zhongyao was questioned, he denied that he had forced the plaintiff to sign and obstructed his freedom. He had now filed a counter-suit, falsely accusing him of defamation. The plaintiff published in the newspaper that I forced him to sign, and there was no truth to it. The judge also questioned the witness Ye Qinghua once, and then instructed that the court had already investigated with the police station in this case, and had not yet replied, and ordered that the trial be rescheduled.</p>

<p>Arrested Rickshaw Pullers - 19 Released</p>
<p>Of the rickshaw pullers arrested in the Jiading Road incident with the Mutual Aid Association, a total of 42 people were arrested. Yesterday morning, the head of the Jiading Road Police Station questioned the truth separately. As a result, 19 people, including Shu Huajin, Xue Yuquan, Xing Hongyi, Luan Zhenzhao, Yin Yongshan, and Zhu Richang, were found to be unrelated to the case and were released immediately. The remaining 23 people, including Cang Gongsen, Zhu Dekun, Luo Deguang, Ma Taizhi, Dai Zhugui, Ji Decai, Li Youfu, Zhu Xitong, Cheng Shuangquan, Wang Guangtian, Han Ruben, Ji Songgao, Sun Yicai, Wang Yuehong, Han Rugen, Chen Hengkuan, Yu Zhijiang, Yin Yonggui, Chi Haishan, Huang Amao, Xu Fuchang, Xing Riqing, and Bao Degao, were all detained.</p>
<p>23 People Sent to Court</p>
<p>They were sent to the First Special District Local Court yesterday morning, where Judge Jiang Shuzi conducted the trial. First, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the circumstances of the incident, requesting an investigation of the defendants for violating Article 150 of the Criminal Law for disrupting order and Article 354 for property damage. Next, the Western head of the Jiading Road Police Station reported the results of the investigation. The officials of the Mutual Aid Association, with the exception of Zhang Dengying, who was still in the hospital, Deputy Secretary-General Chen Chunbao, Hu Kangning, a teacher at the association's affiliated elementary school, Gu Bufan, Zhou Pengnian, and the doorman No. 1327, all successively arrived in court to identify the perpetrators among the defendants and presented the photos taken after the destruction of the items and the slips of paper found on the walls of the association with the rickshaw pullers' request for loans to get through the New Year. Judge Jiang then interrogated each of the defendants one by one, and the defendants' statements generally said that they went to the association to request the announcement of the accounts for 17 months and to borrow the auditorium to hold a memorial service for Yang Binshan, who was beaten to death by rickshaw owners, and all denied destroying property or assaulting people. They retained two lawyers, Zhu Shuzhen and Xi Shichang, to defend them, arguing that four of the defendants were also injured in the assault and requested that a forensic doctor be allowed to examine them. Judge Jiang stated that it was noon and ordered each of the defendants to pay 50 yuan bail and rescheduled the trial. As for the defendants' lawyers' request to examine the injuries, he orally instructed the defendants to obtain bail and then legally submit for examination on their own.</p>
<p>Fear of Defendant's Destruction - Vehicles Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>At 10:00 PM the night before, in the Zhabei area, more than 40 unemployed rickshaw pullers blocked vehicles in a cold and quiet place and had a dispute with the rickshaw pullers on duty. As a result, more than 30 vehicles were damaged. The rickshaw owners, contractors, and rickshaw pullers were all worried about the incident. Therefore, only 50% of the vehicles were released in Zhabei yesterday morning, 20% in Nanshi, and 80-90% in Husi, Hozhong, and Hodong. It is estimated that about 3,000 vehicles were suspended from operation, while the remaining 7,000 vehicles were operating as usual. However, many unemployed rickshaw pullers continued to go out and deflate tires.</p>
<p>Authorities Protect - Suspension of Petitions</p>
<p>More than 10,000 rickshaw pullers were on strike yesterday morning, and together with more than 2,000 unemployed rickshaw pullers, they were all causing trouble. The police authorities of the Chinese Concession have strictly ordered their subordinates to protect the operation of rickshaws along the way to maintain local peace and tranquility, and to arrest those who destroy them at any time. The Rickshaw Pullers Association originally planned to petition the party and government organs yesterday morning, but because the arrested rickshaw pullers had to be sent to the court and needed to be present to observe the proceedings, it was temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Taxpayers, etc. - Agree to Provide Assistance</p>
<p>The Special District Rickshaw Pullers Association sent representatives Cang Gongwen and Zhou Weigao at 2:00 PM yesterday, preparing documents to petition Zhong Si, the local affairs manager of the Ministry of Public Works, and He Dekui, the co-manager, reporting on the process. Zhong and He agreed to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter in accordance with the law. They then went to the Taxpayers' Chinese Association, where Tao Leqin met them and agreed to provide legal assistance. They then went to the First Special District Citizens' Federation, where Liu Zhongying met them and agreed to negotiate. The representatives then supplemented the petition to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and scheduled to petition the Municipal Government and others this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Ms. Chen Speaks On: Gender Equality in Soviet Russia Allows Women to Attain Men's Status <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>A mainland newspaper reports: Miss Chen, daughter of former Foreign Minister Chen Youren, who resided in Soviet Russia for many years, is soon to travel to Russia to participate in the Moscow International Dance Conference. On Thursday, she delivered a speech at the International Art Theater in this city about the status of women in Soviet Russia. She stated that there are certain absolute truths that must be understood: The economic structure of Soviet Russia is completely different from that of capitalist countries, and therefore the social system that arises from it is also completely different from those of other countries. In Soviet Russia, women have absolute equality of opportunity with men. There is complete equality between the sexes in all respects. In fields such as science, the Red Army, aviation factories, and various other industries, there are many women occupying important positions. If a woman's talent surpasses that of a man, she can attain the man's position. Salaries are determined based on talent. If a woman's work ability exceeds that of a man, her salary will be higher than the man's, without any difference due to her gender. Marriage in Soviet Russia is very simple. Marriage never involves financial matters. Even students can get married, because their expenses are provided by the government during their studies. Divorce is now more difficult than before. Each divorce case requires a fee of ten rubles. If there are children, they are always raised by the mother, and the father must pay one-third of the children's maintenance expenses. There is no alimony system in Soviet Russia. Soviet women do not need to be skilled in household management. The Western view of women's position in the family is scorned by Soviet Russia. The aim of Soviet Russia is to free women from the shackles of household drudgery and enable them to engage in more beneficial social work. Pregnant women are entitled to two months of rest before and after childbirth, while receiving full pay. In addition, the state provides a monthly allowance of fifty rubles for a certain period, followed by twenty rubles for a certain period. Pregnant women receive good care from doctors without charge. Therefore, Soviet women are not afraid of pregnancy. Contraceptive methods can be inquired about from doctors. If one wants to have an abortion, it must be discussed with a committee, explaining the reasons for wanting to do so. If the reasons are sufficient, it can be carried out; otherwise, it cannot be done without permission. There are no brothels or prostitutes in Soviet Russia. Former prostitutes have been sent to correctional institutions to be taught how to become good citizens. Criminals are also treated this way, without discrimination, and are not dismissed as uncivilized.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Assaulting a Tram Conductor: Perpetrators Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment, Chen Huaxiang and Chen Genbao Detained for One Year Each, Liu Zhen Given a Three-Year Suspended Sentence and Initially Allowed Bail <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Chen Huaxiang, a 24-year-old local resident, lives at No. 41 Luban Road, Huajie, and works as an auto coppersmith. Chen Genbao is the same age as Huaxiang, lives in a bungalow without a number in the Lu Family Lane, Xujiahui Road, French Concession, and works as a painter. On December 21st of last year, at 7 p.m., the two men boarded tram No. 40 on route 6 of the French Tramway Company from Xiaobeimen, French Concession, heading towards Xieqiao. They refused to purchase tickets. Mu Xiaoshan (32 years old, from Nanjing), the No. 218 conductor on the tram, reprimanded them and insisted they buy tickets, leading to a verbal altercation. The Chens harbored resentment. After getting off the tram at Xieqiao, they gathered accomplices and thugs to wait at the intersection of Xujiahui Road and Beile Road. When the tram returned from Lujiawan and arrived at Beile Road, Mu Xiaoshan, the conductor, got off to switch the red and green lights. The two Chens immediately led the thugs to swarm over, dragging Mu into Huajie and beating him severely, with fists and feet. They also stabbed him in the head, face, lower abdomen, and other places with knives. Mu cried out loudly for help. No. 87 of the French police heard the commotion and rushed to intervene, but Chen and his gang threatened and stopped them with handguns, preventing them from approaching. The police officer then called the Lujiawan Central Police Station, and a large number of detectives rushed to the scene. The perpetrators had already scattered and fled. Only the injured Mu Xiaoshan was lying on the ground, moaning incessantly. Mu was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The police then initiated negotiations, and by 4 p.m. the next day, the French police arrested the two Chens, took them back to the police station, and sent them to the Special No. 2 Court for interrogation and detention. The investigation was postponed for further questioning. Details of the situation were published in this newspaper on December 25th of last year. Later, another accomplice, Liu Zhen (who runs a bicycle shop in Gaochang Temple), was apprehended and brought to the court to be investigated in conjunction with the case. The court also appointed a forensic doctor to go to Guangci Hospital to examine the victim's injuries. The French Police Department filed a public prosecution against the defendants on charges of assault. After careful investigation by Judge Wang Wangxu, head of the Criminal Court, at 10 a.m. yesterday, Judge Wang went to Criminal Division One to order the defendants to be brought before the court for sentencing. Chen Huaxiang, Chen Genbao, and Liu Zhen were each sentenced to one year of imprisonment for jointly injuring a person's body. Liu Zhen was given a three-year suspended sentence. During the appeal period, his father was responsible for bailing him out. The two Chens were returned to the detention center.</p>

<p>Wu Jinbao (also known as Wu Jinbo), a laborer from Anhui, obtained a coffin from the Anhui Guild Hall last August. To his surprise, his father's coffin had gone missing and could not be found anywhere despite extensive searches. Zhang Wu's family repeatedly negotiated with the Guild Hall, but to no avail. They were forced to hire lawyer Huang Menggang to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Local Court, accusing Tang Haizhou, the director of the Anhui Guild Hall, of stealing the coffin and abandoning the body, requesting legal action. After receiving the complaint, the court, presided over by Judge Zhang Shao, summoned and questioned the parties once without resolution. Details of this were previously reported. It is now learned that the case was continued yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. by Judge Zhang. The plaintiff, Zhang Wu's family, was unable to attend due to illness and was represented by lawyer Huang. The defendant, Tang Haizhou, also hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to appear in court to defend him. He stated that Wu Jinbao's coffin had been claimed on November 14th of last year by his nephew, Zhang Zikui, who entrusted Wu Zheng'en to take it back to their ancestral home for burial, with a receipt as proof. Witness Zhang Wu's family testified: "I am 68 years old. Wu Jinbao was my younger brother. He never married or adopted a daughter. The plaintiff, Zhang Wu's family, is my eldest daughter-in-law, Zhang Zhang's family, a widow for many years, who has abandoned my family and remarried."</p>

<p>The Shanghai French Concession Police Department has traditionally sent sick prisoners from the Concession to Guangci Hospital on Kimpather Road for treatment. There was no separate prisoner ward. Upon the request of the French Municipal Council, the French Concession Charity Association took on the task of building a prisoner ward in Guangci Hospital last year, with the Association subsidizing construction costs of 7,000 French francs. The ward has now been completed. The Association has sent a letter to the French Municipal Council thanking them for their enthusiasm for public welfare.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Traveler Commits Suicide by Poison Due to Hopeless Situation <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Due to unemployment and economic pressure, a traveler named Hu Ri, 31 years old from Guangdong, checked into the Juxingxin Inn at No. 434, North Zhejiang Road (North of Hua'anfang), Zhabei, the night before. He paid two jiao for a bed. The inn's regulations stipulate that guests staying in the bed-only section are not allowed to linger in the inn during the day. Therefore, at 10 a.m., any guest who has not gotten up must be urged to do so. Tea server Cao Bingsheng went to the bed at the designated time and saw that the traveler surnamed Hu had not gotten up. He called out several times but received no response. He opened the curtain and was shocked to see Hu's face was pale. Knowing he had taken poison, he immediately reported to the innkeeper Cao Zhupei, who reported to the Tianbaoli Sub-Station of the Menggu Road Police Station. Officer Pan immediately instructed the innkeeper to send the traveler to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road. However, too much time had passed, and he died before treatment could be administered. A bottle of liquid was found on the deceased's bed. It was a four-ounce bottle of Lysol. It is believed that this was taken, making it impossible to save him. The deceased had over ten pawn tickets and a note written in pencil on his person. It generally stated that because he was unemployed, suffering from economic pressure, and had repeatedly borrowed money from relatives and friends, he had run out of options and had resorted to this extreme measure. The body is currently at the hospital. The deceased had a shaved head and was wearing a black cotton-padded jacket with a velvet lining and striped white velvet pants with yellow and black socks. The local bailiff will report to the Shanghai Local Court today to request an autopsy.</p>

<p>At 9:45 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out at the Tongjuyong felt factory, No. 4, Dapu Lane, Dapu Bridge, Nanshi. Due to the dry weather and wind, the felt materials were highly flammable, and the fire spread rapidly, quickly bursting through the roof and spreading to Nos. 5, 3, and 2 on either side. Fire brigades from the northern districts of the city rushed to the scene to put out the fire. However, the wind aided the flames, and they could not be extinguished for some time. After over an hour, the fire was finally put out. As a result, four rooms were burned down. During the fire, a factory worker named Xu Damao, 37 years old, from Hunan, was injured on the head and face while trying to save his belongings. He was immediately taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Further News on the Drug Case Uncovered at the South Railway Station <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>On November 23rd of last year, a large quantity of drugs, weighing over a hundred pounds and disguised as the medicinal herb "Yu Zhu," was discovered at the South Railway Station. It was packed in six burlap sacks and transported by Wang Changgen to the South Railway Station, where it was entrusted to the Daxing Transportation Company for transport to Zhejiang. At that time, the Daxing Company's representative at the station asked Wang Changgen for an invoice and a letter from the consignee. Because the language was unclear, the company sent someone to accompany him to retrieve them. Wang Changgen attempted to escape midway, but the accompanying person called for the police and he was apprehended. Sensing something was amiss, they took him to the Second District Bureau. The bureau sent Shen Wenda to the station to inspect the goods. Upon opening the sacks, they discovered small packages inside the Yu Zhu, which, upon inspection, turned out to be raw drug materials. While Shen Wenda was supervising the inspection, he noticed a man loitering nearby who looked suspicious. The police detained him. Wang Changgen then identified Hu Shimo as the mastermind behind the transportation. The police took him to the bureau for questioning. He confessed that the ultimate boss was Ye Zicai, who was also arrested and brought to justice. Various Shanghai newspapers have reported on this. However, there are conflicting accounts of the truth of the matter. Some say that only three packs of drug materials were found in the entire shipment, mixed with over a hundred pounds of Taikoo sugar. Based on current drug prices, the total value is no more than three hundred yuan. Calling it a large quantity refers to the combined weight of the Taikoo sugar. Others say that since Hu Shimo saw Wang Changgen being escorted by the police to open the sacks at the station, why didn't he escape? It shows the retribution for trafficking in drugs and harming people. Others say that Ye Zicai's family fortune is less than modest, so where did he get the large sum of money to purchase and traffic in drugs? It is puzzling.</p>

<p>Since the Golden Grand Theater in the French Concession's Baxianqiao began staging Peking opera, it has repeatedly invited famous actors such as Mei Lanfang, Ma Lianliang, Shang Xiaoyun, Zhou Xinfang, Cheng Yanqiu, and Tan Fuying to perform, resulting in packed houses. Currently, the contracts of Cheng Yanqiu, Tan Fuying, Yu Zhenfei, and others have expired, and they originally planned to return north immediately. However, due to the flood relief efforts, they were asked to continue performing charity shows for three days. Last night was the last day. The program included Cheng Yanqiu, Yu Zhenfei, Jin Shaoshan, and others performing the complete "The Red Maid" and "Three Heroes of the Dust." Tan Fuying, Gao Xueqiao, Li Baokui, and others performed "Eight Great Hammers" and "Breaking Zhuxian Town," starting with Wang Zuo's storytelling. The proceeds from the tickets will be used for disaster relief. It is also heard that after Cheng and Tan return north, the theater has hired Qingyi and Huashan singer Jin Biyu, and veteran actor and comedian Yu Xiaonong, and other famous actors to come to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Wang Xuecheng, a 34-year-old man from Pudong, used to work as a messenger in an agency but is now unemployed. While he was feeling bored and at his wits' end, he found out that Zhang Ziliang, who lives in the Zhu Family Residence in Pudong, had been detained two months ago for committing a crime. Thinking that Zhang's family could be easily deceived, he had a strange idea. Yesterday, he went to Zhang's sister, Wang Zhang's family, in Zhuhang Lane, Nanshi, and claimed to be a close friend of Zhang Ziliang. He said that he had heard that Zhang had been detained for something, and he had tried his best to get him released. He had negotiated with the Garrison Headquarters and would have Zhang released, but he needed 80 silver dollars. Zhang's sister believed him and, together with her sister-in-law, Lu's family, scurried around raising 35 silver dollars and clothes, which they handed over to Wang Xuecheng. They went to the detention center together. As they approached the Taiping Bridge, Wang suddenly said that the journey was too far and that they needed a car. The women, deeply trusting him, also gave him three dollars for the fare. As they travelled to Wuma Road in the Public Concession, Wang took the opportunity to escape. The two women then realized they had been deceived and went home to report to the Dongjiadu Police Station, asking them to investigate. Wang was caught on the road yesterday and taken to the police station for questioning.</p>

They requested a thorough investigation. The police chief ordered detective Li Zhaogeng to arrest Lu. According to Lu, he had met Ding Wenhua six months ago through his cousin Lu Suzhen. This time, Ding sent a letter inviting him to Shanghai. The Huishan Inn was also opened by Lin. After the intimacy, he gave Ding two yuan. Shen Zhinan said that both the man and woman were shameless and, since they had both admitted to adultery, requested that they both be punished. The police then detained Lu and Ding separately.

<p>Huang Hao, a Cantonese man, 23 or 24 years old, came to Shanghai last spring and worked as a staff member at the Renji Sugar Factory, which was run by his fellow villagers. He was honest and sincere and was praised by his colleagues in the factory. At the end of last year, on November 5th, Renji closed down due to poor business. When the factory staff were preparing to return south together, Huang left for an errand and suddenly disappeared. He has been searched for for a long time, but there is still no trace of him. His family in Guangdong is very worried. If there are any kind people who know of his whereabouts, please notify the owner of Yuanchenghao at Zhengjia Muqiao, Fada Road, this city, who will forward the message. There will be a generous reward. Huang has a square face and is of medium build. He wears Guangdong-style short clothes and speaks with a Shantou accent.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Letter Requesting Temporary Suspension of Photography Requirement for Domestic Servants: Sixth Division of the Second Special District Citizens' Association Writes to the French Inspector General <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department stipulates that all domestic servants must have three photos taken: one to be submitted to the police station, one to be submitted to the employer, and one to be kept by the domestic servant placement agency, i.e., the "broker's shop," to prevent abuses. All "broker's shops" within the concession were notified to implement this requirement. This caused many domestic servants to flock to placement agencies in the Public Concession to seek employment. Employers also went to placement agencies in the Public Concession to hire domestic servants. The police department was unable to interfere. This led to a sharp decline in the business of placement agencies in the French Concession. Yesterday, more than ten agencies, including Jinguiji, Wang Lao Broker, Hong Lao Broker, Hongji Li Piao Broker, Yifeilin Zhe Broker, Shanghai Domestic Servant Placement Agency, and Liu Lao Broker on Julida Road, jointly wrote to the Sixth Division of the Second Special District Citizens' Association for assistance. The Association then wrote to Faber, the French Inspector General of the French Concession Police Department, requesting a temporary suspension of the requirement. The original letter stated: "We have received a joint letter from more than ten member placement agencies, including Jinguiji. They state that the French authorities recently stipulated that all domestic servants introduced must have three photos taken: one to be deposited with the police station, one to be deposited with the employer, and one to be kept by the placement agency. However, the Public Concession has no such regulation. This has caused many domestic servants to regard the French Concession with fear and flock to the Public Concession. This has caused the members' businesses to be unusually slow, but the monthly rent and taxes cannot be reduced. Therefore, we request that you transfer to the French Inspector General that the photography requirement is difficult to implement and request that it be rescinded. Even if the French authorities must implement it, please suspend it temporarily and wait until the Public Concession has the same regulations before implementing it at the same time. This will avoid domestic servants seeking employment in the Public Concession and employers hiring domestic servants from placement agencies in the Public Concession. This will ensure uniformity and maintain business." Based on this, the claims made by Jinguiji and others are indeed true. Currently, most domestic servants are seeking employment at domestic servant placement agencies in the Public Concession, and most employers are hiring domestic servants from placement agencies in the Public Concession. Therefore, we are writing to the Inspector General to request a temporary suspension of the photography requirement. If it must be implemented, then please wait until the authorities in the Public Concession have the same regulations before proceeding at the same time, in order to maintain the business of the domestic servant placement agencies in the French Concession. We deeply appreciate your understanding and hope to hear from you. Sincerely, To Mr. Faber, French Inspector General, French Concession.</p>

<p>To the esteemed Editor: In the special issue of your newspaper yesterday on the Da Sun Company, a section of my conversation contains discrepancies with the facts. I joined Fu Ji Construction Company in 1932 (Republican Year 21). At that time, the Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall had already been completed, and the people in charge were Huang Ziqiang, Zhou Jingxi, Zhou Shuzhi, and Pan Zhihao. The Nanjing Cemetery of Martyred Soldiers began construction in February 1931 (Republican Year 20), and the people in charge were Qiu Xianming, Zhou Jingxi, and Weng Cunlin. The projects I have managed include the 22-story building of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society and the Da Sun Company. Moreover, the company does not have the title of "Chief Engineer of the Entire Company." All important plans, etc., are the responsibility of Mr. Tao Guilin, the owner and general manager of the company. I am sending this letter specifically to clarify this and hope that you will make the correction. Respectfully, Jin Fulin, Fu Ji Construction Company, January 10.</p>
<p>To the esteemed Editor: I am writing on behalf of my client, Mr. Zhang Guanlin, who claims that he read in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on January 10th an article entitled "Son Makes Things Difficult for Old Father, Father Commits Suicide in Anger." After reading the article, he was extremely shocked. After investigation, the reported details are completely unfounded and far from the truth. Guanlin is the eldest son of Zhang Ronghua and his second wife, Yu, and he is a law-abiding businessman who does not involve himself in external affairs. Furthermore, he has no disagreements with his father at all. This sudden death is completely unexpected. The stepmother, Zhou, did not inform Guanlin to attend the funeral and fulfill his filial duties according to etiquette. The inside story is clearly suspicious. Moreover, the original report stated that Guanlin had bullied him to death, that he was born to an outside woman, and that he was adopted into the family of Cha Jiren as a son-in-law. These claims are all baseless rumors and are extremely damaging to Guanlin's reputation and credibility. Therefore, he has commissioned this lawyer to write to your newspaper to request a correction. Accordingly, I am writing this letter on his behalf and requesting that you investigate and make a correction to avoid further disputes and maintain our friendly relations. Respectfully, Chen Xuelu, Lawyer, January 10.</p>

<p>Since its founding, Shimin Primary School at Dongxinqiao, Gongguanma Road in this city has been striving for practicality in everything, without seeking empty fame. All the male and female teachers employed are graduates of universities and middle schools, and they are conscientious in their teaching methods and strict in their management, which has earned the trust of parents. It has now expanded to include a table tennis room, a library, a games room, and classrooms for both senior and junior levels. It is learned that the school has begun enrolling students, and the number of people registering and requesting information has been very enthusiastic in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e174">A Retrospective and Prospect of Educational Administration (Part 1) - 5:30 PM, January 9, Lecture at the Central Broadcasting Station <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Today is the first time in the 25th year of the Republic of China that I have come to the broadcasting station to give a speech. At the beginning of this new year, we should naturally look back on the work of the past year, and based on past experience, make plans for the future. In the past year, the Ministry of Education's facilities for educational administration cannot be described in detail in this short period of time. Now, I will give a brief report on the more important new facilities:</p>
<p>(1) Reorganizing Schools Above the Specialized Level</p>
<p>In recent years, the Ministry of Education has spared no effort in reorganizing higher education. The reasons and methods for the reorganization are not based on subjective opinions, but entirely on objective facts. Before the reorganization, a large number of inspectors were dispatched annually to various places to inspect schools above the specialized level. The inspectors were all experts, and the inspection method was to adopt a departmental inspection system. In the 23rd year, more than 40 schools were inspected. The results of the inspections have been ordered to improve. In the spring of the 24th year, more staff were dispatched to various places to inspect the actual situation of the schools' improvement in the past year. More than 90 schools were inspected. Looking at the inspection reports, the schools have made considerable improvements on the Ministry's instructions on various key points for improvement, such as reorganizing departments, enriching equipment, cracking down on absenteeism, strict enrollment, focusing on moral education and research, and strictly implementing the system of full-time teachers and staff. However, a few schools, limited by the environment, have shown little achievement. The Ministry of Education has re-instructed and ordered them to comply. The reorganization of departments is based on two principles: one is the merger of duplicate or excessive departments, and the other is the reorganization of departments that lack teachers and equipment and have no hope of development. The former are mostly liberal arts departments, and the latter are mostly practical science departments. In recent years, the reorganization of university departments has gradually become rationalized, unlike the chaotic situation of a few years ago.</p>
<p>(2) Emphasizing Practical Science</p>
<p>In order to prevent the abnormal development of liberal arts and practical science, and to remedy the drawbacks of talent surplus and shortage, the Ministry of Education has specially stipulated the enrollment ratio of various departments in universities to correct the excessive development of liberal arts and gradually increase the number of practical science talents to meet the needs of national construction. In recent years, the number of practical science students has gradually increased compared with the previous few years, and at the same time, the number of liberal arts freshmen has also gradually decreased. Although the amount of increase and decrease is not very large at present, there is indeed a trend of increase and decrease. At the same time, the increase of practical science departments is also actively underway. If manpower and financial resources are limited and cannot be expanded in fact, then orders are given to establish lectureships in order to instill practical science. In recent years, the increase of practical science has included six colleges, three departments, two subjects, and six lectureships. The subsidies for private schools above the specialized level also pay considerable attention to the enrichment of practical science.</p>
<p>(3) Implementing the Degree Granting Law</p>
<p>The formulation of the Degree Granting Law is entirely to improve academic standards. It has now been resolved by the Legislative Yuan and presented to the National Government for promulgation. The most important point is that the degree adopts a three-level system of bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. The travel date is also planned by the Ministry of Education and presented to the National Government for promulgation, which has been implemented since July 1935, and the Ministry has ordered all universities, colleges, and educational halls and bureaus to be informed. The detailed rules for degree classification and the detailed rules for the master's degree examination have also been formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(4) Holding Qualification Examinations for Students of Unregistered and Closed Private Schools Above the Specialized Level</p>
<p>This examination has been held several times in the past. The Ministry of Education has examined the results, classified them by grade, and issued transfer certificates. However, there are still many students in unregistered private schools who are waiting and unwilling to move forward, losing their opportunities. Afterwards, they have repeatedly requested relief. In the winter of the 24th year, another examination was held in Beijing and Shanghai. It was ordered that public and registered private schools above the specialized level must not accept transfer students from unregistered and closed private schools above the specialized level, as well as students from unregistered and closed senior secondary schools, from the 24th year onwards, in order to show restrictions. The examination has now been completed. A total of more than 180 students in Beijing and more than 1,500 students in Shanghai participated in the examination. The test papers are being graded and will be announced soon.</p>
<p>(5) Implementing Compulsory Education</p>
<p>The implementation of compulsory education has been planned by the Ministry of Education for many years. This time, in accordance with the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fourth National Congress, the outline of the provisional measures for the implementation of compulsory education and the detailed rules for implementation were formulated and promulgated by the Executive Yuan in May of last year. The implementation content is divided into three phases: the first phase is from August 1935 to July 1940, running one-year short-term primary schools; the second phase is from August 1940 to July 1944, running two-year short-term primary schools; the third phase is from August 1944, the compulsory education period is four years. In addition to running short-term primary schools, it also implements the promotion of junior primary schools, enriches the number of original classes, strictly implements the two-part system, improves private schools, and pilots itinerant education. During the period of compulsory education, short-term primary schools do not charge tuition fees, and student textbooks are also provided free of charge by the schools. Healthy school-age children in various places are supervised by local educational administrative agencies to force their parents to enroll. In terms of funding, it is borne and raised by the local government, and the central government provides appropriate subsidies. This year, the central government's subsidy for compulsory education in various places is 2.4 million yuan, plus border education funds and Gengzi compensation funds, for a total of 3.2 million yuan. The first phase of compulsory education has now begun, and the provinces and cities have reported the situation to the Ministry, which is very smooth.</p>
<p>(6) Implementing Children's Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education aims to awaken the national masses, pay attention to children's education, protect children's physical and mental health, and seek children's welfare, so as to complete children's physical, mental, and social abilities. Therefore, there is the implementation of Children's Year. The implementation period is from August 1, 1935, to July 31 of this year. The central government is composed of the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Interior, and the Ministry of Industry, together with the China Children's Welfare Association, to organize the National Children's Year Implementation Committee. The provinces, cities, and counties are composed of educational administrative and health administrative agencies, as well as children's career groups, to organize the Children's Year Implementation Committees of the provinces, cities, and counties. There are 25 provinces and cities that have been established and reported to the General Association. Regarding the work plan, the outline of the implementation measures and the implementation procedures are formulated. The important work is roughly divided into four categories: children's education, children's health, children's protection, and the organization of children's happiness groups. They are carried out separately according to the implementation procedures. In this year, there are four important children's exhibitions: The National Children's Book Exhibition will be held in Beijing for about a week on January 31; The National Children's Toys and Teaching Aids Exhibition will be held in Beijing in April; The National Children's Health Exhibition will be held in Beijing in May; The National Children's Painting Exhibition will be held in Shanghai, date to be determined (undetermined).</p>

<p>High-Speed Motion Picture Camera for Finish Line Records</p>
<p>For all speed finish line records at this Berlin convention, it has been decided to adopt a state-of-the-art high-speed camera as the standard for judging. This camera also comes equipped with timing components, both of which can be activated simultaneously during recording. It is adjusted using a special device based on the alternating current frequency, offering six speed levels with the fastest at one-thousandth of a second, followed by one-hundredth of a second, one-tenth, and so on, ensuring no wasted time in recording.</p>
<p>This device is a small, variable machine that can operate continuously, capturing between a hundred to sixteen photographs per second. Matters like determining race rankings, which were previously difficult to observe in detail at slow-motion speeds, can now be distinctly judged. This camera underwent various trials at last year's European Athletics Championships, yielding very positive results. As such, judging errors in the sports world can be entirely eliminated from now on.</p>
<p>Convention Car Advertising</p>
<p>Since last fall, the advertising train planned by the 11th Aryan Olympics Advertising Committee has appeared in various German cities and neighborhoods, conducting domestic public advertising. This train consists of two freight cars, each equipped with four-wheeled trucks, with a large curtain stretched between the two cars. Visitors can freely enter and exit, finding within them various models and films related to sports, as well as historical items about the Aryans, allowing the public along the route to immediately grasp the historical significance of the Aryan Olympics. This train does not stay long in any location, with the entire route planned to cover over ten thousand miles or seven thousand miles, starting from major cities.</p>
<p>The Aryan Olympics Giant Bell, Symbol of Peace</p>
<p>This bell, cast by the Bocbhum Steel Forging Company on August 14th of last year, weighs seventeen tons. The casting requires several weeks for cooling. It is now complete and will be transported to the top of the memorial tower at the convention site, to be permanently hung. The tower is approximately two hundred and sixty feet high, and from August 1st of this year, the massive bronze mouth will resonate deeply in our ears.</p>
<p>During the 1855 World Exposition held in Paris, three giant bells manufactured by the same company were displayed, selected from a large number of bells made of "cast steel plates," worth more than double today. Since then, the company has manufactured and exported over one hundred thousand giant bells to countries around the world, including industrially developed nations like England, France, America, and Italy, further demonstrating their superior sound quality as the best in the world. As a friendly nation, we are participating in the grand event. The resonance of the Aryan Olympics on August 1st, combined with the simultaneous ringing of giant bells from around the world, creates a harmonious sound akin to that of brothers, making the symbol of peace all the more joyful.</p>
<p>The True Winner</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Aryan Olympics Committee of the South American Argentine Republic broadcast a radio speech on the true spirit of winning in the Aryan Olympics, the gist of which is as follows:</p>
<p>A winner must be persevering, capable of enduring hardship, full of fighting spirit, and also possess self-reasoning, correct mistakes, blame failures on their own faults, and discover and heal their weaknesses. If one desires greatness, then one must work hard to improve oneself, take the strengths of others to make up for one's own shortcomings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a winner should repeatedly practice each task ten or even a hundred times to achieve its effect, and be prepared to give up temporary happiness such as walks, pleasure, fame, and contemplation to strengthen their character and fulfill the primary conditions, so that victory will naturally be solid.</p>
<p>The so-called winner is one who pursues an ideal undertaking, but instead of resting in a dream realm, should work hard in that dream realm to make it a reality.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Most of the boys coldly ignored him, but Dan, though he said he hated him because he had no courage, protected him fiercely, and would immediately punish anyone who dared to insult him or frighten him with his old fists. His loyalty to his friends was not inferior to that of Xiao Mei, but the refinement of the way he expressed it was different.</p>
<p>One afternoon, Dan was sitting by the creek, intently studying the various habits of a small spider's home, when he suddenly heard a short conversation over there. It turned out that Nada had recently felt like he had thorns in his back, and wanted to be sure who the real culprit was; because one or two boys had begun to suspect that they might be wrong, Naide continued to deny it, and humbled himself to accept people's neglect. This suspicion made Nada unable to bear it any longer. He privately disobeyed Mr. Pei's clear admonition and questioned Naide several times. This time, seeing Naide reading a book alone in the shade of the wall, he could not help but stop and try again on that taboo topic. Before Dan arrived, he had been interrogating Naide for ten minutes. The first few words that the spider scholar heard were Naide saying in a patient and pleading tone:</p>
<p>"Don't do this, Nada! Ah, don't do this! I can't tell you, because I don't know. You shouldn't bother me privately. Uncle Pei told you not to make things difficult for me. If Dan was here, you wouldn't dare do this."</p>
<p>"Bah! Am I afraid of Dan?" He's just a bad sack. I think the money of Taomo was not taken by others, but by him. You know it, but you just don't want to say it. Say it now!"</p>

<h3 id="e187">Finance. The Gold Market Continues to be Suppressed by the Foreign Exchange Market, Briefly Breaking 40 Yuan Before Stabilizing. Ultimately, it Fell Slightly by Six Cents, and the Situation Remains Uncertain. <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was influenced by the sharp rise in British and American exchange rates, Chinese merchants dumping US dollars, a hardening foreign exchange market, increased selling pressure, and consistently weak sentiment. The market briefly retreated below 40 yuan, with short sellers also covering their positions, ultimately stabilizing. In the morning, overseas silver markets saw the British market shrink and the American market remain flat. Major players indicated that after the market closed, there were some buyers at slightly higher prices than the listed prices. It was widely believed that American buyers were limited, and there were a few informal forward transactions below the recent listed price of 25. London forward silver prices remained unchanged or fell by up to half a point. Exchange rates rose, and London spot gold fell by one penny. Sentiment remained difficult to boost. Off-exchange preliminary trading opened at 43.4 yuan, but lacked support, resulting in very few transactions. The Central Bank announced that the listed prices for British and American currencies remained flat, and the Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 1146.3 yuan, dropping to around 42 yuan. Subsequently, Wing Lee, Fook Hing, and Wing Chun took advantage of the low prices to buy in slightly, causing a slight rebound. However, the opening price in the morning remained unchanged, and the market immediately showed weakness and a downward trend. However, due to buyers taking advantage of the low prices, the Hang Seng Bank announced that the listed prices for British and American currencies remained flat, maintaining stability, but with limited fluctuations, hovering around 42 yuan. The hardening foreign exchange market easily triggered increased selling pressure, leading to gradual weakness, with only small fluctuations remaining. The silver equalization tax was announced to have fallen by 1.75 points. Chinese merchants actively sold off, and the domestic US dollar market remained loose, leading to an oversupply in the market, breaking the 40 yuan mark and suddenly falling. However, due to banks seizing the opportunity to buy at low prices, strong buying support emerged after the decline, allowing the price to rise above 40 yuan again, gradually stabilizing sentiment and the overall situation. The market remained relatively stable at noon, and the afternoon market also opened steadily. Although there was a slight downward trend after the opening, banks remained willing to make exchange transactions and buy US dollars for the end of January, and buyers continued to take advantage of the low prices, gradually pulling the price up. However, optimism remained difficult to achieve, and many people were selling off their holdings. The initial report for Indian silver was unchanged or up one anna, followed by a second report of a five-anna increase, leading to renewed selling pressure and another decline, but the 40 yuan mark was not broken. After the decline, the market entered a period of consolidation, ultimately being forced to close due to floating positions. The swap spread fell to 5 yuan yesterday. The market situation for today will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 114 yuan and 70 cents, down 40 cents from the previous close. Retail investors Qian Yuan, Wing Wai Cheung, Fook Hing, and Wing sold immediately. Sassoon bought February shillings at half a penny, falling to 1.5 yuan. When Wing Lee came, it rose to 2.1 yuan. Wai Cheung sold to 1.7 yuan. Fook Yu and Heng Yu further rose to 2.1 yuan. Wai Cheung and Deli sold to 1.7 yuan again. Heng Yu continued to rise to 2.2 yuan. Tai Tak Shing Lai sold, falling to 1.6 yuan. Hang Seng Bank listed, both British and American currencies were flat, and sentiment stabilized. Tung Tai Cheung, Heng Yu, Yu Sun Cheung, Wai Cheung Lai bought, rising to 2.7 yuan. February US dollars were at 6.875, with supply exceeding demand. Tai Tak Shing, Heng Yu, Wan Fung, Yuan Mao, Wing Lai sold, falling to 1.2 yuan. Shun Lee Tung Tai Cheung took advantage of the low price to settle accounts, rising to 1.6 yuan. The foreign exchange market remained tight, and Chinese merchants actively sold silver. The silver equalization tax was announced to have fallen by 1.75 points. Fook Hing, Wing Heng, Tai Tak Shing, and Wing Lee competed to sell, falling to 0.5 yuan. Fook Hing, Wing took advantage of the low price to buy, rising to 1 yuan.

<p>— Ci</p>
<p>In the past three or four years, our country has been hovering under this kind of policy of the great powers, becoming the object of their dumping policies, the tail-end of their surplus commodities. The main countries that have a close economic relationship with our country, such as Britain, Japan, and the United States, have all seen their currencies depreciate by between 40% and 60%. The United States' increase in the price of silver is a further step to increase the purchasing power of our country's currency, but it has put our country in an extremely difficult situation for the past two years.</p>
<p>If we want to analyze the meaning represented by the numbers in the table above, we can see that in 1929 (the 18th year of the Republic of China), the countries had not yet abandoned the gold standard, and the price of silver had not fallen, so our country's foreign exchange remained normal. In 1930, the price of silver began to fall sharply, and our country's foreign exchange also fell with it. In the 18th year, the British exchange rate was 20.524 pence, but in the 19th year it fell to 14.769 pence (as did the American and Japanese exchange rates). It reached its extreme in the 20th year, with the British exchange rate only being a little over 12 pence, the American exchange rate at 22.2 yuan, and the Japanese exchange rate at 45.2 yuan, the lowest prices seen in more than ten years.

<h3 id="e190">Securities. Reaction After Frequent Falls in Public Bonds. Market Sentiment Rebounds at Closing. Market Prices Rise Slowly. <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange did not show a strong market situation. Although there was a sign of recovery after a period of fatigue in the afternoon market, it was only due to gold speculators covering their short positions and retail investors buying in following the trend. No. 4 initially lay dormant, taking the opportunity to raise prices when they rose. The low-pressure atmosphere in the market has not subsided. Large investors continued to sell, with Nos. 48, 54, and 78 consistently selling. Rumors circulated about reducing interest rates on bonds, or extending the principal repayment period, or issuing new bonds to recall old bonds to achieve unification. According to investigations, these rumors had some basis. Therefore, the current focus of market price fluctuations is whether there will be any changes to these bonds, and whether the situation in Suiyuan will expand, both of which are sufficient to influence the market situation. The future is not optimistic. When the market opened yesterday morning, there seemed to be a rebound initially, with the top stocks rising by 12 cents to half a yuan. Since the gold market shortened, the selling pressure in No. 48 was extremely strong. Nos. 3, 14, 49, and 54 also sold, and sentiment immediately softened. The bottom stocks then turned weak by 12 cents. The bearish trend continued in the second round, with No. 4 temporarily lying dormant to avoid the brunt. Nos. 11, 21, 35, and 48 were all selling. The biggest drop was 70 cents in the 22nd of this month, and the rest also fell uniformly by 3, 5, and 60 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, Nos. 16, 17, 21, and 51 saw some scattered buying, mostly by gold speculators and retail investors covering their short positions. Although there were many sellers, demand was seen to exceed supply, and prices rebounded by 12 cents to half a yuan. At the close, No. 4 sharply raised the reorganization price, soaring by 75 cents, boosting market sentiment, and market prices slowly rose. This was also a reaction to the two consecutive days of decline. The biggest rebound was 65 cents in the 20th district. The high pressure remained heavy after entering, and Shanghai was weaker. As a result, except for the 22nd district in this month, which was still down by 25 cents, and No. 96, which was down by 10 cents, the rest all rebounded uniformly by 5 cents to 55 cents. The total number of transactions was 18.93 million yuan. The results of the rises and falls are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New Feng Yanghang reported that yesterday (the 9th), the New York stock market rebounded and fell. Small stocks in the morning rose straight up due to rumors, and leading stocks were slightly loose. Traders, considering the unfavorable situation, sold off in large numbers, and the price could not be supported. Oil stocks were the strongest due to the rise in kerosene prices in Texas. The National Federation Committee proposed that President Roosevelt increase the price of gold to 41 yuan per ounce. Europe discussed this matter quite seriously, and speculators felt as if they had fallen into a fog, but felt that the words of Finance Minister Morgenthau were more reliable. According to Morgenthau's words, there is no need to overemphasize the devaluation of the US dollar. Railway stocks were very strong at noon, and then rebounded. Silver stocks were very active, hoping that silver coins would be devalued, and if so, the price of silver would be increased. Small exchange stocks fell. In the bond market, railway and kerosene rose first, and then rebounded. The full-day transaction was 3 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the decline is rapid. The US cotton futures broke the 1-cent mark, and the yarn market followed closely, causing more panic. The general retail market is wavering, and the end of the account period is approaching, so buyers are even more uneasy. However, the bulls in the financial sector have not taken any action, and Da Kee's short positions continue to increase. How the future will change depends on the US cotton market.</p>
<p>Morning Market Plunges</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market in the morning saw a uniform decline in each month, and the market was extremely alarmed, because the US cotton three-piece yarn fell sharply, the bulls were hit hard, and the selling pressure was very strong. Da Kee's short positions continued to sell, Geng Feng cut positions, and Yu Da Shen Kee greatly bought back positions. As a result, each month fell by 1.9 yuan, 2.2, 2.4, and 2.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon market, those who profited made slight offsets, with each month rising by 4, 5, and 6 cents. The second and third shifts were flat. By the time the market closed, it was heard that Osaka's three-piece yarn was not strong, and market sentiment loosened and fell back. As a result, each month rose or fell by 3 cents compared to the morning market closing price. 3,600 bales were sold by Da Kee, 1,500 bales by Geng Feng, 500 bales by Chang Yu, 1,350 bales by Da Chang Cheng, 800 bales by Run Kang, 500 bales by Sheng Yuan, 750 bales by Jin Kang, 450 bales by Zhen Da, 650 bales by Yuan Yi, 650 bales by Yi Chang, 1,350 bales by Xin Cheng. 800 bales were bought by Tong Kee, 400 bales by Da Fu, 1,950 bales by Yu Da, 600 bales by Jin Chang, 650 bales by Chang Kee, 1,450 bales by Shen Kee, 950 bales by Tai Chang, 750 bales by He Xing, 500 bales by Ming Hua, 800 bales by Chang Feng, and 800 bales by Run Kang.

<p>The cotton market has fallen sharply and the situation is extremely serious, because although US cotton spot prices have fallen by 5 pounds, futures have broken the 1-cent mark. US Merchants and US Ann Yanghang have sold off in large quantities, and market sentiment is even more panicky. Xin Cheng has turned from long to short, but the bulls in the financial sector have not taken any action. This month has broken the 40-yuan mark. Xin Cheng has sold off 17,200 dans alone.</p>
<p>Xin Cheng Turns From Long to Short</p>
<p>The opening of the spot cotton market in the morning saw a uniform collapse in each month, with the US cotton October futures price at 9.83 cents, the December futures price at 9.76 cents, and Indian cotton also falling by 3 rupees 7 bis. Osaka three-piece cotton fell by 1 yuan. As a result, market sentiment shook, selling pressure was extremely strong, and prices fell across the board. This month broke the 40-yuan mark. As a result, each month fell by 9.5 cents to 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon market, those who profited on near-term contracts bought back short positions, rising by 2-4 cents, but the rise in far-term contracts was weaker. The second and third shifts turned loose again. As a result, each month rose by 5 cents to 4 cents compared to the morning market closing price. 7,700 dans were sold by Mei Kee, 17,200 dans by Xin Cheng, 2,600 dans by Tong Kee, 3,200 dans by He Xing, 3,100 dans by Sen Kang, 2,100 dans by Da Chang Cheng, 3,800 dans by Chang Feng, 2,300 dans by Yuan Hing Chang, 1,400 dans by Hing Chang, 1,700 dans by Yi Chang, and 1,000 dans by Rui Da. 1,200 dans were bought by Shen Chang, 4,100 dans by Da Fu, 2,900 dans by Shen Kee, 4,400 dans by Yuan Yi, 1,600 dans by Yi Chang, 3,700 dans by Sheng Yuan, 9,300 dans by Chang He, 6,200 dans by Yi Kang, 3,100 dans by Sen Kang, and 1,700 dans by Run Kang.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened weakly, with each month falling by 8 to 12 pounds. Traders are reluctant to act before the government proposes a new plan. However, the government may not issue it until after the High Court decides on the Louisiana Rice Mill case. In the morning, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, bulls closed positions, foreigners sold off, and market prices fell slightly. Then, the market rebounded due to traders buying in and covering short positions. Finally, the bulls closed positions, the South and the public sold off, and the old bulls painfully spit it out, and the market was soft. January was firm due to few deliveries, and the pressure on the distant months was heavy due to the inability to limit production. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 pounds, and futures fell by 23 to 35 pounds. English cotton spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 14-5 points. Indian cotton was bought by Japanese traders and European exporters, buying headers, but futures traders sold off in large quantities, and speculators and buyers also sold off. As a result, Ping Guoer fell by 2 rupees, and Aomura and Bai Luoxi fell by 3.75 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (9th electric).</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market showed the continued support of Wu Xian Ping. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were 8/8 to 13/8 of a cent lower for Chicago wheat and 12/12 cents lower for Canada. The market was cautious, and because the end was near, all parties made few new purchases, so transactions were weak, and prices fluctuated, with no change from the previous day. In the afternoon, the market still opened weakly, but later because customers in this month withdrew slightly, and the factory's chips were only one week away from the market closing, they were gradually withdrawn, so the far-term months were held up. According to industry insiders, it is speculated that this month may be raised to the 1-cent mark.</p>

The afternoon market was more active, and the second and third month's contracts changed hands. The June contracts for new wheat were originally small at 42 cents. After the flour market improved, it came back. At this time, due to the imminent end of the market, there was little room for development in the market. The spot wheat market was slightly better, and the high-priced goods were 12 cents better than the previous day. Opening price of Bengbu Mingguang wheat was 4.94 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat was 4.92 yuan. A total of 3,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin, Fufeng, and Shenda.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of each gang were slightly scarce, with a total of more than 30 vendors arriving (goods totaled more than 6,000 stones). The street was not smooth, and the Su Tung Keng increased the price due to the scarcity of goods. However, the South Port early rice was only seen as a settled situation.

<p>Yesterday, the Kehsiang rice market saw active sales and arrivals, leading to a resurgence in the market. Although the arrival and storage quantities have been high in recent days, digestion has been slow, leading to a bearish outlook. Previously,囤户 (speculators) inquired, giving the market a slight boost. Today, with speculators hesitant, the market was initially seen as weak. However, actual sales in the local market were brisk, and firms also planned to purchase stock while prices were low. Consequently, trading picked up, and the market regained strength. If sales continue to be robust today and tomorrow, rice prices may gradually increase again. The total daily sales included 3,090 bags of Jiangxi rice, 239 bags of Ningbo rice, 1,000 bags of Hunan rice, 600 bags of Hankou Shashi rice, 2,500 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, and 100 bags of Yuan rice, all purchased by local firms.

According to a telegram from Shantou, Chaozhou-Qingdao production prices rose by twenty to thirty cents. However, local firms, citing weak sales, remained hesitant. Over 300 bags were sold yesterday at prices ranging from 9.9 to 10 yuan. Refined brown sugar was also sluggish, with about 400 bags sold at prices ranging from 12 to 12.23 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e201">My Views on Women's Issues <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yazi</p>
<p>Since being elected as a Central Supervisory Committee Member of the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang, I have rarely spoken. According to the Party's discipline, members should not freely express opinions externally, especially since I am only a nominal committee member. However, this time, due to the special circumstances and the request of brothers Shoujuan and Jiping to write for the Shenbao Women's Special Edition, I have to make an exception.</p>
<p>First, I must state that I advocate the theory of evolution in everything. However, my theory of evolution is not entirely imported but includes native Chinese elements. I don't understand classical studies, nor do I greatly admire Confucius, but I strongly agree with the theories of the Great Harmony in the Book of Rites and the Three Ages of Gongyang. Naturally, regardless of whether it is truly a doctrine of Confucius or a fabrication by scholars of the Han Dynasty. I have not deeply studied Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, but I believe that nationalism, democracy, and the people's livelihood should be divided into three stages. Thus, integrating the past and present, and combining the old and new, we can say that Gongyang's Age of Disorder corresponds to Sun Yat-sen's stage of nationalism, which is also what modern Western scholars call the stage of feudal society. Gongyang's Age of Ascending Peace, the Age of Moderate Prosperity in the Book of Rites, corresponds to Sun Yat-sen's stage of democracy, which is also what Western scholars call the stage of capitalist society. Gongyang's Age of Great Peace, the Age of Great Harmony in the Book of Rites, corresponds to Sun Yat-sen's stage of the people's livelihood, which is also what Western scholars call the stage of socialist society. The above is the backbone of my advocated theory of evolution.</p>
<p>Applying this to women's issues, the idea that women should not speak outside the home, should not hear opinions from outside, and should follow their husbands no matter who they are, is, of course, a feature of feudal society. Organizing small families, participating in productive enterprises, and breaking away from feudal shackles, yet living under the money system, selling labor power insufficiently, followed by selling sexual organs, is unavoidable in capitalist society. Later, the ideal of everyone contributing according to their ability and receiving according to their needs, breaking down the marriage system, and advocating free love can only be achieved in a socialist society. Sun Yat-sen urged us to catch up head-on, of course, to overthrow the system of feudal society, but not to be satisfied with simply following capitalism. Everything is like this, and women's issues are no exception.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I want to look at the actual situation of the current world. Hitler wants women to return to the kitchen, which is a concern about the phenomenon of capitalist decline. He simply wants to reverse the car back to the old home of feudal society, but how can this road lead anywhere? In our country, there is an even more deformed situation: on the one hand, rural women are still living the hellish life of the 18th century; on the other hand, urban women have already embarked on the path of capitalist decline. The surge in imported cosmetics and the willingness of women to regard themselves as playthings and commodities are not their sins, but merely symptoms of the end of the century, which have already festered beyond repair. When men are in extreme distress, they use alcohol and women to escape. Why can't women adopt the same attitude? Therefore, advocating new female virtues and new principles of being a virtuous wife and good mother, though well-intentioned, is probably still the wrong medicine.</p>
<p>To solve women's issues, we must solve the entire social system. Gongyang's Age of Great Peace, the Age of Great Harmony in the Book of Rites, Sun Yat-sen's stage of democracy, and what Western scholars call socialist society are all waiting for us.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Inaugural Message <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>The Women's Special Edition, after two months of preparation, finally meets its readers today. I regret not being a daughter myself, and I do not have a deep understanding of women's issues. Therefore, this publication does not dare to take on the mission of guiding the women's community, but only from a male perspective to conduct in-depth research with the sisters and hope to gradually improve the status of women in the future and overthrow the inherited concept of valuing men over women.</p>
<p>Since the German dictator Hitler chanted the tune of "women returning to the family," a storm of criticism arose, and the women's community especially opposed it, believing that Hitler had ill intentions. He intended to bury women in the family, so they would have no right to ask about social and national affairs, so that men could control everything and do whatever they wanted.</p>
<p>The dictator's claims, of course, inevitably contain selfish and self-serving prejudices, which are absolutely unacceptable. In the editor's view, women's comings and goings must still adopt a compromise method, that is, when society and the country have events, they should stand up and directly serve society and the country, and when society and the country have nothing to do, then they may as well retreat to the family and be their virtuous wives and good mothers.</p>
<p>The sisters should not think that the scope of the family is too narrow and the tasks are too trivial to bother with personally. The ancients said that to govern a country, one must first manage one's family, and only when the family is managed well can the country be governed. This is indeed true. Serving the family is no less important than serving society and the country. For example, if a housewife is not at home all day, entrusts her children to a nanny for education, and leaves the housework to the maids, the result will certainly not be good. When children first open their minds, they develop all kinds of bad habits, which have a major impact on society and the country. If housework is not personally attended to and the maids act recklessly, it will inevitably lead to chaos and even countless problems, causing the husband to always have concerns and be unable to concentrate on serving society and the country. Therefore, I believe that women cannot leave the family, and the family really needs a virtuous wife and good mother.</p>
<p>If women think that the affairs in the family are too simple and do not take much time, then they can engage in academic research in their spare time. Madame Curie of France, who invented radium and benefited the world, is the best example. Those who have the ambition should do the same. May everyone work together!</p>
<p>Symposium</p>
<h3 id="e203">Thoughts on the Shenbao's Launch of the "Women's Special Edition" <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Zhan</p>
<p>The Shenbao's special "Women's Special Edition" every Saturday, starting in the 25th year, shows the thoughtfulness of the newspaper's colleagues. This women's issue, which once attracted attention, but now even women themselves do not pay attention to it, is brought up again by the newspaper to shift the eyes of the social community. From the perspective of women, this cannot be described as a very gratifying thing!</p>
<p>Many people say that men and women now stand on an equal footing, and women do not have any special problems. If there are problems, they are various problems shared by men and women—such as vocational education, economics, etc.—rather than problems unique to women. Women have problems only under very special circumstances. Talking about women's issues now seems to be like yesterday's news.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seems that women have no special problems for discussion. Upon careful consideration, we realize that women's personal problems are still numerous! Not only do women have many problems under special circumstances, but even if men and women are completely equal, women's problems still exist—and will always exist.</p>
<p>A woman can be equal to a man in law, economics, education, and politics, but a woman herself still has her special tasks. Are the responsibilities of being a mother and a wife completely consistent with the responsibilities of being a father and a husband? Therefore, there are many problems that mothers and wives should pay attention to. In terms of the actual situation, the living conditions of most women in China today, whether they are intellectuals or ignorant women, are different from those of general men. Their scope is mostly limited to the family; their duties are mostly managing the household and raising children. Since the facts are so, we absolutely cannot ignore the facts and sing high-pitched tunes. To improve the efficiency of their lives, women's specialized publications have their special value.</p>
<p>As for whether men and women in our country today—and even in the whole world—are completely standing on an equal footing, this is something that everyone knows is not true. At most, we can say that some people are opposing gender equality. In terms of the actual situation, this world is still a world ruled by men, which everyone must also admit. Women in this position have even more problems. The launch of the "Women's Special Edition" not only allows mothers and wives to use it as a mouthpiece to express their grievances. Women's problems in the family and in society can all be published and discussed in its pages. If it can do this, the "Women's Special Edition" will have its actual contribution.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e204">Impressions of Nie Zeng Jifen <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiping</p>
<p>After the publication plan of this journal was determined, we carried out two things: one was to specially invite female pioneers to write articles, and the other was to collect materials on women's issues. I really want to expand this garden, so that the domestic women's community has the opportunity to discuss together; however, I dare not predict whether our wish can be effectively achieved. If the women's community can work together, this small wish may not become an illusion. As for myself, I plan to spend part of my time every week to visit female leaders, record their great theories as a guideline, and I hope readers will correct any omissions!</p>
<p>In Shanghai, female talents emerge in large numbers, and there are countless people who can express opinions and write articles. However, those who combine wisdom and virtue and are known for promoting mother education are not easy to find. After thinking about it, the first person I thought of was Mrs. Nie—Zeng Jifen. She is the daughter of Zeng Wenzheng Gong and the mother of Mr. Nie Yuntai. She is 85 years old this year. She has been diligent and thrifty in managing her family and has worked hard in family education throughout her life. To say that she is a true virtuous wife and good mother, she can be called the first person of the contemporary era!</p>
<p>The time I visited Mrs. Nie was on the morning of January 9th. When I walked into Chongde Hall on Liaoyang Road, the Western-style building was silent. Mr. Yuntai was chanting scriptures in the Buddhist hall. The family led me to the living room to wait. I saw three portraits hanging on the wall. On the left and right were Zeng Wenzheng Gong and his wife, and the other was Mrs. Nie. After a while, Mr. Yuntai invited me into his study. He was very humble and had the demeanor of a gentleman. He spoke Hunan dialect and did not forget his roots. In my previous imagination, Mr. Yuntai was a tycoon in the industrial world. Who knew that after talking to him, I realized that he was also knowledgeable and had outstanding academic skills? In recent years, he has closed his doors to guests and has been studying ancient and modern books without omission. So, we started talking about ancient Chinese culture and went all the way to Western culture, the Meiji Restoration of Japan, the political situation in the Soviet Union, and Chinese women. Once he started talking, he was eloquent, and the problems became bigger and bigger, farther and farther away from what I wanted to ask. In the end, he praised Mr. Liang Shuming to the highest degree, and regarded Liang's book "The Last Awakening in the Chinese National Salvation Movement" as a masterpiece that young people must read. Two hours passed in a flash, and I said that I wanted to talk about the topic now and asked him to introduce me to the old lady, so we slowly went upstairs.</p>
<p>The Chongde old man came out very briskly, with a kind and benevolent smile that made people respectful. She was healthy and looked like she was in her 60s. To save the old lady's time, I didn't dare to talk too much and only asked the following questions:</p>
<p>How has the old lady managed the family for sixty years?</p>
<p>I have always followed the principles of integrity, diligence, thrift, and peace to guide my children. Everyone is united in mind and heart, helping and encouraging each other, so there has never been idle talk in the family, and the children and grandchildren have been able to work hard and make progress. Even now, they still do not change their original aspirations. According to my experience, as long as the parents can respect etiquette and morality, family education will not be decadent. (Mr. Yuntai said: My mother has a gentle and kind nature and has never spoken harshly, so her words are always happily followed by her children and grandchildren.)</p>
<p>What are the old lady's opinions on the small family and the large family system?</p>
<p>I think each has its advantages and disadvantages. According to the current trend, large families have no possibility of existence. Even my family has adopted the small family system, but they are interconnected and closely related, and still do not lose the fun of the large family. In general, the biggest shortcoming of small families is that they do not care about the support of the elders. Let me tell you a few facts: a senior official of the Customs has a monthly salary of 800, and his father is a tax officer. His mother is old, and neither father nor son cares about her. The mother borrows ten or eight yuan from her son, and he always acts high and mighty. This is one thing. An old beggar went to a mansion to beg, and the owner took out one yuan and threw it out the window. The old beggar took the silver and left in tears. People asked him why he only got one yuan. He said, "This is my son's villa!" This is another thing. A celebrity at sea owns huge sums of money, but his father is still driving a horse-drawn carriage on the streets of New York. Do you think these things are reasonable?</p>

<p>I heard that your house used to publish a family quarterly and hold family gatherings. Please tell me about the process.</p>
<p>This is a thing of the past. Because our family of more than 80 people was scattered in all directions, it was not easy to gather them together. So, my son Yuntai edited the "Nie Family Quarterly", which was later changed to a quarterly. Family members freely expressed their opinions. In five or six years, the circulation increased from more than one hundred copies to more than three thousand copies. At first, it was only for family members to read, but later, relatives and friends asked to read it, and even provinces, cities, and counties came to read it. A collection was published every year, for a total of five or six collections. Seven or eight years ago, Yuntai became ill, and the family newspaper stopped publishing. At that time, the "Nie Family Benefit Meeting" was held every Sunday, and young and old gathered together. It was a grand event. Each record was also specially published in a small booklet to show that it was not forgotten.</p>
<p>How does the old lady spend her time now?</p>
<p>I don't often sit in a carriage and go to the streets to see the market, select and make various medicinal pills, or distribute money to help the poor and sick, to fulfill my wishes. Besides, there is nothing else. At this time, it was already noon, so I said goodbye and left.</p>

<h3 id="e207">On Chinese Women Studying in Japan <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Fa</p>
<p>When the Japanese currency fell last year, many female students took this opportunity to study in Japan. Now, although the price of Chinese and Japanese currencies is almost equal, there are still many female students coming to Japan to study. The educational purpose of Japanese women is completely different from that of men, so most girls' schools only offer courses such as housekeeping and sewing. Ordinary women graduate from junior high school and higher girls' school. Not many enter women's universities or take university education with men. Among the Chinese female students studying in Japan, most study medicine. They enter specialized schools of obstetrics, dentistry, and ophthalmology. Others enter various private universities to study liberal arts, law, and economics. Very few study education, agriculture, and industry.</p>
<p>Because female students who come to study in Japan mostly want to enter schools above the specialized level, they must obtain a high school diploma or above in China before they can enter school. Although Japanese private schools often enroll Chinese students without exams, there are also schools with extremely difficult entrance exams. Chinese female students hear in China that it is easy to enter Japanese schools, so some come to Japan without a certificate, and as a result, they often fall into a dilemma.</p>
<p>The social interaction between Chinese male and female students has always been open. Especially female students studying in Japan, because they live in a foreign country and have no relatives, they must have a few boyfriends to take care of each other. However, in Japan, where the old etiquette is extremely important, there is often suspicion about the interaction between female students studying in Japan and their boyfriends. And inevitably, a few female students neglect their studies because they are pursued by male students, which is very regrettable. In fact, male students living alone in a foreign country have to do the work of tidying up their rooms and mending their clothes and socks themselves. However, female students often refuse to do such trivial things and hire Japanese maids to serve them. Therefore, the Japanese mistakenly believe that all Chinese women are like female students studying abroad who are unwilling to manage housework. On the one hand, it makes Japanese women even more hardworking in managing the family.</p>
<p>Chinese students studying abroad always wear student uniforms and Western suits all year round. Even if someone brings a few pieces of Chinese clothing and suddenly wears them, they are often ridiculed by their peers. This is a special mentality. However, Westerners and Japanese who come to our inland areas have never been seen wearing Chinese long robes and short jackets. So, if you ask why students studying abroad don't wear Chinese clothes, no one can answer. The only exception is female students studying in Japan. Except for sometimes wearing Japanese clothes for fun out of curiosity, they all wear cheongsams, just like in China. This is admirable. They still preserve the essence of our country.</p>
<p>In China, female students already have the phenomenon of being well cared for and disdainful of handling housework. Since studying abroad, this mentality may be even more advanced. They often despise Japanese women for being willing to be slaves and taking pride in serving men. On the one hand, they observe the diligence of Japanese women in housework and the harmonious relationship between couples, and they cannot help but admire them. Therefore, the observation of Japanese women by Chinese female students studying in Japan is in a relative state.</p>
<p>We often see groups of Japanese women crossing the ocean to marry overseas residents or marry local natives in various places. Sometimes, forced by life, they follow men to cultivate abroad. It is not uncommon for Japanese people to be respected for going to study abroad far away from their motherland for the sake of learning.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Drifting (Part 1) <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wang Yin Jiu</p>
<p>This is really a terribly frightening story. Although there was no bombing by planes or tigers eating people and other bloody deeds, I can't help but feel my heart beat faster and feel infinite sadness when I think about it; because the victim in this incident—Sister Qiuyun—still doesn't know where she is drifting to this day!</p>
<p>Sister Qiuyun was originally the happiest one among our classmates. She had beauty, health, and intelligence endowed by heaven, which were several points better than others; we often had to suspect that heaven was favoring her in the same way as Mrs. Nuttall in school, otherwise, how could her academic performance be so good, and her body be so excellent? What was especially enviable was that she also had a very happy family: her father was not a high official, but because he had been working in the banking industry for a long time, his position was quite high, and his economy was relatively affluent, but he was not a big banker with hundreds of thousands or millions of assets, so there was no need to worry about kidnapping; her mother was a veteran normal school graduate, and of course her temperament was extremely kind and her mind was also very modern; she had three elder brothers, the first and second of whom already had considerable occupations, and the third was still studying, and they were all very friendly to her; and in terms of her parents, because they had three boys first before they got her, this girl, they loved her even more than the three elder brothers. She grew up gradually in this satisfying environment, as carefree and comfortable as a swan. In school, she was even praised by the teachers, and in terms of classmates, even if she seemed a little proud, and inevitably a part of the people were hostile to her, these irrelevant obstacles would never affect her beautiful life. She finally graduated very happily from the university department, and also received the first-place A-level honor award. When we shook hands and said goodbye at the door of the auditorium, she carried a flower basket given to her by her cousin and said to me with a smile:</p>
<p>It turned out that her father deeply loved this only daughter. A month before she graduated, he had already prepared the procedures for her to study abroad. She herself was of course very excited and would tell everyone she met about this.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Standard Woman - The Simple Life of the Blackshirt Prime Minister's Wife <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>She could live in a grand official residence, but she prefers to live in a simple country home.</p>
<p>She could hire a throng of servants and live a life of ease and luxury, but she enjoys handling all the household affairs herself, even going into the kitchen to cook. She could socialize with the nobles of the court, but she prefers to chat with ordinary people.</p>
<p>If others were in her position, they would certainly be arrogant and condescending, but she remains kind and approachable, never putting on airs of a noble lady.</p>
<p>Who is this noble lady? It is none other than Mrs. Rachele, the wife of the world-famous Italian dictator, the Blackshirt Prime Minister Benito Mussolini.</p>
<p>Mussolini is currently devoting all his efforts to the war with Abyssinia. If the Italian army can achieve a great victory in this war, forcing Abyssinia to cede vast territories and join the Italian domain, then Mussolini's position will be more secure than ever, and he will become an idol worshipped by the Italian people. If the war drags on with no end in sight, with the soldiers' blood constantly staining the battlefields and the treasury's gold continuously being sent abroad, once panic breaks out at home, Mussolini's authority may inevitably fall. Mussolini's eldest son, Bruno, and his second son, Vittorio, are currently serving in the air force on the front lines in Abyssinia. His son-in-law, Count Ciano, is also the commander of the air force's suicide squad.</p>
<p>The entire Italian people are willing to express their patriotic fervor for the Italian-Abyssinian war, and they are all extremely concerned about the war's outcome. But no one is more concerned than Mussolini's wife, Rachele, because her husband's lifelong happiness and the lives of her two sons and one son-in-law are all closely related to the war. Although she is worried sick, she keeps it hidden in her heart, unwilling to show the world even a hint of it. Her daily life remains unchanged. Born into humble circumstances, she never harbored any desires for a life of ease and luxury. She avoids all social engagements and never attends any grand ceremonies. She does not seek to share in her husband's glory. She lived in an ordinary house in Milan for a long time, and now, she still spends most of the year in seclusion in the countryside.</p>
<p>She avoids public attention and seeks to enjoy family life out of her own nature, not out of any compulsion. But even if she wanted to change her situation, she would not have the opportunity, because Mussolini has always maintained that women's place is in the home, which is praised by Italy and the world.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mussolini also has several other distinctive traits. She prefers choosing plump young chickens to understanding national politics. She is better at cooking delicious fish dishes than at socializing at receptions. She loves listening to her children's babbling more than engaging in social chit-chat. She disdains all fashionable clothes, expensive jewelry, and other luxuries.</p>
<p>If Mussolini were to lose power and step down tomorrow, becoming a poor man again, his wife would be able to live with him peacefully in the same simple, frugal life they had many years ago when they were young and poor, without feeling any pain. If she were to sigh at that time, it would certainly not be because her good dreams had been shattered, but only because her husband's grand ambition to make Italy an unsurpassed power had failed midway. It can be asserted that her wish is only to live with her husband and children in an ordinary house, enjoying the joy of family life. At that time, she will truly become that kind of woman.</p>
<p>In short, Rachele, as the prime minister's wife, could well have lived a life of ease and luxury and shown off her status to the public, enjoying the flattery of the masses. Although her husband advocates that women's place is in the home, she could still do as she pleases. But now, she hides in the countryside, personally grinding grain and still retaining the flavor of a country woman. In the eyes of the average modern official's wife, she is simply a foolish woman. However, who praises the cleverness of modern officials' wives?</p>

<p>The source of this disease may be due to pulmonary tuberculosis, syphilis, malaria, typhoid fever, dysentery, surgery, or blood loss from trauma, resulting in insufficient blood, diluted blood, withered blood, or yellow blood. The face is pale, the lips are white, the spirit is depressed, the muscles are thin, health is lost, and all kinds of diseases appear. If not treated early, it will eventually lead to wasting away and death.</p>

<p>Patient Zhao Qinsheng suffered from pernicious anemia. He had undergone repeated medical treatments without any improvement. His body became increasingly thin, and symptoms of weakness appeared repeatedly. Last autumn, he was introduced by his cousin Zhao Fugeng to see me for diagnosis and treatment. After I administered gonadotropin, his blood gradually became thicker, and his face and lips turned red. His blood and energy were replenished, his muscles developed, and all his previous ailments disappeared. He became stronger and healthier than ever before.</p>

<p>Common Bad Habits and Venereal Diseases Among Young People</p>
<p>Young people are full of vigor and should abstain from lust. However, due to the great divide between men and women, they are driven by desire, tempted by pornographic books, and led by bad friends, resulting in many people committing the bad habit of masturbation. The body gradually weakens, the spirit gradually depletes, leading to nocturnal emission, weakness, and other symptoms. Health disappears, diseases multiply, happiness is extinguished, and life is shortened. It is truly lamentable that such promising young people are harmed by this invisible axe.</p>
<p>Patient Shi Linian suffered greatly from masturbation, resulting in nocturnal emission. His essence was depleted, his body was thin, and he suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness. He had undergone repeated medical treatments without being cured. After marriage, he also experienced premature ejaculation. Last autumn, he came to me for treatment. I prescribed Himito's sperm-strengthening pills to treat his nocturnal emission and instructed him to purchase and take gonadotropin from Zhengwei Pharmacy to treat his premature ejaculation and weakness. After taking about five boxes, his body quickly recovered and became stronger. He was completely different from before.</p>

<h3 id="e214">My Wife Regained Her Health and Beauty, I Feel the Same <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— (Manuscript from Xu Jianbing)</p>
<p>My wife, Ms. Cen, comes from a distinguished family and has always been delicate. Since marrying me, we have been very happy. Three years after our marriage, she gave birth to a son, further increasing our love. However, my wife suffered from postpartum imbalance, resulting in kidney deficiency, back pain, weakness, and frequent illnesses. The most troubling thing was her irregular menstruation and profuse leucorrhea, which could not be treated. Later, she was introduced by our relative, Mr. Cen Yongchang, to Dr. Zhan Nianhui for diagnosis and treatment. Thanks to the external application of "Leucorrhea Remedy" and the oral administration of "Female" Gonadotropin, her ailments disappeared as if lost. Her body quickly became stronger, her back became strong, and her blood and energy were replenished. Remembering that my wife was able to regain her health and beauty, thanks to Dr. Zhan and his effective medicine, I feel the same. I am writing these words to express my gratitude and will introduce others to him.</p>

<p>— (Dr. Zhan Nianceng)</p>
<p>(1) Premature Ejaculation Cured, Smoking Addiction Also Broken</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Jihong, 39 years old, local resident, businessman. Mr. Zhang was born weak and had been ill since childhood. He lacked proper care, making his body even thinner. As he grew older, he was seduced by a neighboring woman and lost his virginity early. After several years of intimacy, he became extremely depleted and suffered from premature ejaculation. He then started smoking to compensate, which seemed to help at first. However, as his addiction grew, his premature ejaculation worsened. It was difficult to quit and difficult to get rid of. After marriage, he was effectively celibate with his wife, only holding the empty title of husband. He consulted doctors and took medicine without finding a cure. He tried to quit smoking in every possible way, but always failed halfway. Last year, fearing the severity of the ban on smoking, he finally sought a cure. He was introduced by his brother-in-law, Mr. Xu, to see me for diagnosis and treatment. I performed the latest scientific surgical radiofrequency therapy and prescribed "Gonadotropin" to remove his nicotine addiction, break his smoking habit, restore his weakness, and treat his premature ejaculation. After a month or so, his addiction was broken and his illness was cured. I met him last month, and he said that his wife was already pregnant.</p>
<p>(2) Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea Cause Great Suffering</p>
<p>Patient Jin Shengzu, 24 years old, Zhejiang native, businessman. Eight or nine years ago, Mr. Jin was poisoned by pornographic books and mistakenly committed the bad habit of masturbation. He indulged in it daily, causing great depletion. He often felt dizzy, had headaches, and suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness. He realized the harm and stopped. Unexpectedly, his body was too depleted, leading to nocturnal emission. Whether he had colorful dreams or was in a daze, he would ejaculate. Upon waking up, he felt extremely frustrated. His nerves became increasingly weak, and he often suffered from back pain, night sweats, and heart palpitations. He tried various tonics, but they were ineffective. Last autumn, he heard from a friend and sought a sex disease doctor. He came to me for treatment. I observed that his reproductive glands were severely declining. In addition to performing radiofrequency surgery, I also prescribed "Himito's" sperm-strengthening pills to treat his nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea, and "Gonadotropin" to replenish his deficiencies. After five weeks, all his symptoms disappeared, and he regained his health.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is located on the second floor of the China Trust Company at the corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road. Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Another Treatment for Nocturnal Emission and Insomnia</p>
<p>Patient Kong Shangxian, 20 years old, local resident, student. Early in life, Mr. Kong was seduced by bad friends and mistakenly committed the bad habit of self-pollution. He wasted his essence in secret. Relying on his strength, he did not take it seriously. Later, due to excessive depletion, he developed nocturnal emission and insomnia. He consulted doctors and took medicine without any effect. Moreover, his wedding date was approaching, and he was afraid of affecting his fertility and future happiness. He wrote a letter asking about his illness. After I replied, he came for a face-to-face consultation a few days later. After a detailed examination, I prescribed "Himito's" sperm-strengthening pills to strengthen his sperm reservoir and treat his nocturnal emission. I also instructed him to purchase "Gonadotropin" from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company to replenish his deficiencies and treat his insomnia and weakness. After taking five boxes continuously, his nocturnal emission stopped, and he became strong and healthy, as never before.</p>
<p>A Case of Kidney Deficiency and Back Pain Treatment</p>
<p>Patient Xia Jingchang, 46 years old, tailor, worker. During his youth, Mr. Xia was ignorant of the principles of health preservation and did not take care of himself. He had many girlfriends and frequented brothels, leading to venereal diseases. Although he was cured, his body was weak. He often suffered from dizziness, blurred vision, and back pain. He took medicine all year round with little effect. Before the age of fifty, he was already old and decrepit, with a sallow complexion and no blood and energy. His spirit was depressed and listless. In early autumn last year, he asked his colleague, Mr. Lu, to introduce him to see me. Mr. Lu had suffered from incomplete development and had been cured by me using Gonadotropin. After examining him, I instructed him to purchase Gonadotropin from the Chinese and Western pharmacy to replenish his spirit, energy, and blood. His aged appearance disappeared, and his weakness was also cured.</p>

<p>— (Manuscript from Ma Chaoran)</p>
<p>Praised as Rebirth Parents</p>
<p>(Omitted above) Since getting married, I have felt even weaker. My spirit was sluggish, and my muscles were thin. I suffered from dizziness, back pain, and other symptoms. I took many kinds of medicine without any effect. I spent years brewing medicine and boiling tea, but the symptoms of kidney deficiency kept increasing. In recent years, I have also experienced cold limbs and tremors, heart palpitations, and night sweats (omitted in the middle). I received electrotherapy from Dr. Zhan Nianceng and was instructed to purchase Stanna's Gonadotropin from the Sino-British Pharmacy. After taking it, I suddenly felt much better. The symptoms of weakness gradually disappeared. After taking several boxes continuously, I felt clear-headed, strong in my back, with fuller muscles, and a refreshed spirit. Recalling the past, it was like a spring dream. Dr. Zhan's skillful hands brought me back to life, and Gonadotropin's miraculous elixir cured my ailments. You are truly like parents who gave me a second life.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>The source of this disease is indigestion, resulting in undigested food accumulation in the stomach and aversion to food upon seeing it.</p>
<p>Those suffering from loss of appetite have a reduced appetite, and their nutrient intake is naturally insufficient, often leading to weakness and other symptoms. The reason for sluggish digestion and loss of appetite is the lack of gastric juice in the stomach. Administering gastric juice preparations will naturally strengthen the stomach, promote digestion, and stimulate appetite.</p>
<p>After taking "Stomach-Strengthening Essence," it can be converted into a large amount of gastric juice, digesting accumulated food and supplementing nutrition. Taking it continuously for several days will greatly increase appetite and open up the stomach. However, those suffering from gastritis or stomach pain should first take "Stomach Pain Remedy" to treat their ailments.</p>

<p>This column is answered by renowned doctors Wang Shiying, Ren Guoxiang, Yu Bofu, Qiao Wenbin, Jia Zhizhong, Zhan Nianceng, and the editor. Due to the large number of inquiries, we will answer them on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking and Breaking Addiction</p>
<p>MR. MR from Avenue Albert asks: I have a deep smoking addiction. I have repeatedly resolved to quit, but I always give up due to the frequent pain. I have long admired your publication for its rich experience and believe that it must have a good method for quitting addiction without pain. I hope you will provide an answer to your publication so that those who suffer from the same illness can learn from it.</p>
<p>(Answer) Treating disease, curing weakness, removing toxins, and breaking addiction are all necessary to quit smoking and achieve the best results. Only Stanna's "Gonadotropin" has all the above conditions. It can be purchased from Wuzhou, Sino-Western, Huamei, Sino-French, Zhengwei pharmacies, and the Western medicine department of Wing On Company.</p>
<p>Leukorrhea and Abdominal Pain</p>
<p>Xu Genyuan asks: My wife suffers from abdominal pain during her menstrual period and persistent leukorrhea. She has taken various medicines without being cured. Please advise on a good remedy.</p>
<p>(Answer) Your wife's illness should be treated both internally and externally. Taking female Gonadotropin internally and using Leucorrhea Remedy externally can cure it.</p>
<p>Another Question About Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Zhu Shangsheng asks: I now understand that my illness was caused by mistakenly taking inferior medicine. In the future, I will only take genuine sperm-strengthening pills with the "Himito's" label to avoid further mistakes. However, I know that my deficiencies are very severe. I am now planning to supplement them. I don't know what dosage I should take.</p>
<p>(Answer) Please provide a detailed address in future letters, as our publication receives a large number of letters, making it difficult to review them. Also, our publication's space is precious. We will reply to letters as much as possible. Only when it is absolutely necessary or there is a need for publication will we answer in this column. Taking "Gonadotropin" is the best way to supplement your deficiencies.</p>

<p>Gratitude After Curing Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Recalling two months ago, I was in deep water and fire. Now I feel like I am re-entering the nuptial bed. Initially, I suffered from weakness and kidney deficiency, leading to nocturnal emission. I consulted doctors and took medicine without any effect. The frequency of nocturnal emission gradually increased, and my strength was exhausted. It was difficult to support myself. I suffered from insomnia and night sweats almost every night. Later, I accidentally read in this publication that nocturnal emission can be cured by taking Himito's sperm-strengthening pills. Unexpectedly, the first batch I bought was cheap and did not have the "Himito's" label. Taking it not only had no effect but also increased my headaches and loss of appetite. Later, I specifically purchased those with the "Himito's" label. After taking them, my illness was completely cured and did not recur. I am now taking "Gonadotropin" to replenish my deficiencies. I am strong and healthy, as never before. Alas, these two medicines are truly a lifeline for patients suffering from nocturnal emission and weakness. However, the ordeal of mistakenly taking other medicines still makes me shudder to think about it.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Chinese Cinema and "Extraordinary Times" in 1936 <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Lv Gang</p>
<p>This is not an arbitrary assertion, nor a prediction, but an observation based on the development of the current situation. 1936 will be an "extraordinary time." Following 1935, in a world full of crises, it will be even more dangerous and turbulent. Although 1935 was spent amidst dense war clouds and numerous wounds, it is difficult for us to say, at the beginning of this new year, whether 1936 can pass through this great difficulty unscathed. Looking back, in the recently passed 1935, East Africa, following the Far East, also experienced a war of imperialist aggression against a semi-colonial country. The only difference is that the former's government, under the urging of the people, rose up to resist, while the latter, in order to maintain peace, repeatedly lost provinces covering millions of square kilometers. However, the two are the same in that the imperialists, in the midst of urgent crises, plunder the interests of weak nations in order to seek their own way out.</p>
<p>During the September 18th Incident, China's cinema was stimulated by the situation, and both its quality and quantity were greatly improved. The selection of themes no longer followed the previous feudal-style chivalrous stories and absurd low-level novels. Many films with the theme of anti-imperialist national war appeared on the market. Moreover, the improvement of Chinese film production technology also took this period as a major turning point. But in reality, it was ultimately a manifestation of the Chinese people's rising emotions for national independence and liberation. Because we cannot deny that cinema, like drama, is a tool of education and a weapon of combat. Therefore, the Chinese people's support for the appearance of films with anti-imperialist themes, which influenced general film practitioners to compete in producing such films, was not accidental. However, as the situation changed, the anti-imperialist climax declined due to environmental obstacles. Speculative film practitioners then turned to producing films far removed from reality, and some even moved women's legs to the screen, pursuing their sweet, intoxicating, and rosy dreams. However, in these past two years, China's crisis has deepened compared to the era of the September 18th Incident, and the enemy has taken advantage of the danger to repeatedly occupy North China to complete its daydream of a continental policy. Yet, film authors do not seize on this current theme, but instead delve into the path of decadence, attempting to indirectly anesthetize the nerves of the people for the enemy. How tragic is this!</p>
<p>Now, we have entered the "extraordinary time" of 1936. The crisis will only increase compared to the previous year. With countless difficulties ahead, where will Chinese cinema go? Is it still good to be in a cloudy world, forging beautiful dreams under the enemy's gunfire? I think that even if the masses do not explicitly express their new demands for film themes, in the current situation, film authors should also deeply reflect on themselves. Naturally, there were progressive films last year, but compared to the total number of films, the difference is too great.</p>
<p>Opening up the era of 1936, this eventful autumn of "extraordinary times," in order to save ourselves and to save this world that is about to be split and destroyed by imperialism, we must also showcase Chinese cinema and see how it will reflect this turbulent year.</p>

<p>At that time, Zhuanxu and his followers chased to the broken part of Buzhou Mountain, saw the party of Gonggong scattered there, and shouted and killed. Gonggong also gathered his party and made a life-and-death battle with Zhuanxu. For a time, the noise shook the sky, and blood flowed everywhere. (19)</p>
<h3 id="e223">Bridge <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>There is a long, wooden plank bridge that connects the town and the village. It is important, like the bones of the human body. With it, a bridge, people on both ends begin to come and go frequently. Thinking back to the time before the bridge, although there were boatmen who could replace the bridge, carrying people on both ends, it always took too much time and manpower.</p>
<p>Because both sides felt its need, two sharp-tongued individuals took the lead, soliciting donations from the rich and apportioning contributions to shopkeepers. ... The resulting amount is a mystery! But it must have been a large sum.</p>
<p>So the bridge was built, but it was so crude:</p>
<p>Driving a few wooden piles into the riverbed, placing a few horizontal timbers on the piles, and laying three large planks, nailing them firmly with iron nails. A bridge was completed. Two months of work was not even enough. As for the railings on both sides of the bridge, they were simply made of weak bamboo poles. People walking across the bridge couldn't even rest their arms on them before the railings swayed and vibrated.</p>
<p>However, there was finally such a bridge for people to use, and a new, happy feeling would float into people's minds.</p>
<p>—Like hanging in mid-air without touching the ground. How dangerous!</p>
<p>But then some people had thoughts like this come to mind. Because when walking on it, the wooden planks rustled, as if they would fall down at any moment. And from under the bridge, sitting on a boat and looking up, looking at the middle of the piles connecting to each other, because when the river water rose, it was impacted by the water force, again and again, the connecting position gradually moved away, as if it were just placed there. People walking on the bridge, moving and moving, it would collapse, almost making people feel a terrible premonition at any time.</p>
<p>And the people who pass by on the bridge every day are bustling and countless.</p>
<p>One day there will be trouble, and the people on the boats coming and going under the bridge will often worry about the people on the bridge.</p>
<p>Spring rains are especially heavy, often raining continuously for days, so the river water rises, and the water slowly surges upwards, with the water level almost level with the bridge bank. One can reach out and dip into the water, and the wooden piles are submerged in the water and cannot be seen. Thus, the bridge seems even more like it is floating on the water.</p>
<p>And in the spring, on this end of the bridge is the city, and on the other end is the village area. As usual, every spring is the grand season for holding dragon boat races. Because there is that bridge, people standing on the bridge can get a good view, so the location was changed from another place to here, to that side of the bridge.</p>
<p>That afternoon, there were countless people who came to the bridge from both sides, from the village and from the city, to attend the event. The railings on both sides of the bridge were crowded with people from beginning to end. The dragon boats sped on the turbulent waves, one against the other, beating drums and gongs, competing with each other. Countless people on the bridge clapped and shouted at the top of their lungs when they were happy, cheering them on. Some people were pushed to the back and couldn't see clearly, so they pushed forward hard, and the people in front pushed back, everyone forgetting that they were standing on a bridge that seemed to be floating on the water. As a result of pushing back and forth, starting from the railings that were pushed broken, the rest of the railings all collapsed together, and then people rolled into the water one by one. And the river under the bridge was turbulent and bottomless, those who rolled in were immediately swept into the roaring whirlpool and sank; perished.</p>
<p>Those who did not roll down, seeing their companions swallowed by the waves, a great cry filled the space.</p>
<p>It also became a great ritual for the dragon boat race.</p>
<p>That incident was three months after the bridge was completed. Who should be blamed for this? Perhaps only the ignorant bridge, and the ignorant curses of the people.</p>
<p>And then, the rain continued to pour down heavily, endlessly for ten days or half a month, the river water rose step by step, even submerging the entire bridge in the thick, turbid yellow water. Finally, the city gates also lowered the water gates, and the boatmen also sailed to the riverbank and tied a thick rope to the large bridge trunk on the shore, securing it tightly, so the people on both ends had to temporarily sever relations. Separated by a vast expanse of water. After some days passed, the rain stopped, and the river water gradually receded, but the bridge was almost completely destroyed. And a bridge is indispensable, naturally important to build, but this time, because of the lesson of the previous dragon boat race tragedy, everyone felt the need to demand permanent safety, it is best to use cement and steel bars to cast it, but it requires a very large construction fee...</p>
<p>Large-scale fundraising and apportionment began.</p>
<p>Several months passed, and it was said that the harvest was satisfactory, and the people on both ends were unusually excited and happy. The construction of the new bridge also started. Soon after, the new bridge was completed. But it was still exactly the same as the old bridge, crude. The only difference was that it was slightly wider.</p>
<p>People were disappointed: There was money to build a bridge with cement and steel bars, why is it still a makeshift wooden bridge?</p>
<p>The money for building the bridge was collected by everyone. In the past, although it was very difficult to travel back and forth without a bridge, there was no unexpected burden of repairing and building the bridge. But now, there is a bridge, and at the same time, there is an unexpected and almost compulsory apportionment. As for a safe bridge, it has never been produced. Seeing that bridge, people can't help but be angry and surprised.</p>

<p>Opening "Peach Blossom Spring"</p>
<p>Where is the immortal source to avoid the Qin? In the past, a Wuling man explored the secluded place. He, fishing for a living, was leisurely and carefree. He often traveled on the misty waves. He forgot how far he had gone, only caring to go forward along the stream. Suddenly, he saw peach blossoms on both banks, redder than brocade. Fragrant grass filled the embankment, greener than turf. At the end of the forest, a beautiful mountain rose up in front of him. Then the cave entrance revealed light. The fisherman, leaving his boat and going ashore, entered. He walked through the peach blossoms and saw a village. Fields and paths intersected, with lush mulberry trees and bamboo. The crowing of chickens and barking of dogs could be heard in the distance. The men and women in the fields wore ancient clothes. Suddenly, they met and greeted each other with smiles. The elderly and the young were all joyful. They killed chickens and made food to feast the guests. They said that their ancestors had come here to escape the chaos of the Qin Dynasty. They had come to this isolated place to live. Today, they did not know what world it was, as if they were cut off from the mundane world. The fisherman fully described the events of the present day. They sighed together about the changes in the world. They prepared wine and food and invited him to stay. They treated him warmly and earnestly. The fisherman lingered for several days before returning. They all said, "Do not tell the outside world about this encounter." The fisherman returned to his boat and marked the original road. He told the governor of the county when he arrived at the shore. The governor sent people to follow him to explore again. The entrance of the cave was lost in the mist and could not be found. The noble scholar Liu Ziji of Nanyang went there in person with joy, but it was also in vain. From then on, no one asked about it again.</p>

<p>Opening Thought</p>
<p>Changchun has beautiful scenery. Peach and plum blossoms compete in beauty and are especially fragrant. The peony, the color of the country, blooms with wealth and honor. They compete with the herbs and gather fragrance. Thousands of reds and purples welcome the spring. They attract butterflies to fly around busily. The cuckoo on the branch does not stop singing. It teaches me to be lazy to dress up in front of the mirror. The cherries unintentionally dot rouge. The dejected hibiscus has long green eyebrows. The spring silk clothes have not been changed. The light skirt is tied with fluttering ribbons. The double lotus is noble. Who will paint it? Suddenly, I stop embroidering, thinking of you. I secretly divine under the lamp. Every night my soul crosses the ocean in dreams. After the cold plum is separated from the clouds, the moment passes and the begonias are released to the sea. The weaver girl and the cowherd are separated by the Silver River. It is difficult to send red beans to the heart. My confidante is a small clove. She smiles and advises me to put on makeup. I only hope that he will achieve fame early and fulfill his ambition. Returning home for farming, we will reunite on the bed of joy. At that time, the sea beauty will often accompany the crape myrtle man.</p>

<p>The old hero is the frugal retail merchant. It is Guan Shoufeng, with white hair and a wrinkled face. Only to see soldiers escort him in a motorcycle. Unexpectedly, his daughter has returned home gloriously. That Xiugu, smiling and carrying a bag in both hands, enters. She tells the twists and turns of the situation in detail. Shoufeng, listening, is secretly pleased in his heart. He is worthy of being a Huangshan knight. Xiugu is majestic. What a magnificent sight. It is very different from before. She is only saying goodbye to her neighbors in the same courtyard.</p>

<p>Said that I have entrusted my life to a red silk. Today I am leaving Beijing with a lost expression. That is why I am not waiting to say goodbye. Those neighbors in the same courtyard are all surprised to see her. They envy her for entering the clouds and rising to the ninth heaven. Waiting to see the girl's car driving away. Shoufeng smiles calmly and is filled with joy. I really can't bear to let my daughter go. It is only because the road is long and there are thousands of miles of mountains. I don't know when we will meet again. That is why I am sending a flying wild goose with a long gaze. Although I have been living with you day and night for a long time, I can only say goodbye to you like parting swallows. I will entrust you with the silver money cloth bag. This trip is all said in silence. Furthermore, the Fan family's son and the old man have agreed to be companions in the restaurant today. It is nothing more than a temporary farewell to talk about old times. It is good that I have no companions to wander around the world. I am only used to walking east and west with my daughter. Today I advise you to drink one more cup of wine. It is only because the beauty is suffering from a disease of infatuation. You must never mention the old things and keep her in your heart.</p>

<h3 id="e229">A Brief Discussion of "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River" <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>From the completion of "Pear Blossoms in the Rain" to "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River"</p>
<p>About two years have passed between them, and director Ma Xubang has spent all this time on the preparation of the script, and the preparation and production work. Moreover, this script was specially written for Chen Yanyan. If we say that it is an exceptionally excellent work, you will not disbelieve it.</p>
<p>This amazing work of art</p>
<p>It has a lively and strong life. You say it is like a fragrant and rich flower; but it is also like a raging fire of struggle burning in the hearts of every young person.</p>
<p>The poison of feudal remnants still hovers in the human world like a man-eating beast. Here, it has clearly told us how modern young people who have been harmed can eliminate the poison and obtain happiness in life!</p>
<p>This should be said to be a world-class tragedy</p>
<p>Because its plot is tortuous and moving, its depiction is detailed, and its style is fresh and beautiful; therefore, watching this film is like reading a novel with great literary value. We dare to guarantee this.</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Release Date of "Wedding Night" is Not Far Away <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Yue Feng, who was praised as a so-called rough-line director for the film "Escape", changed his style and still used Yuan Meiyun and Wang Yin, who had excellent achievements in "Escape", to star in an all-sound dialogue film that takes marriage problems as the main theme, dissecting the love problems between young men and women in the current society, "Wedding Night", has been fully completed with extremely outstanding results after more than two months of hard work; it is now stepping up the editing work, and it is expected that it may meet with the ladies of society in a joyful atmosphere in the latter half of this month.</p>

<p>You Xingzhao plays a pastor in "Brothers' Walk", and a set of pastor's clothes are specially made for him. Because Lao You is obese, there is no suitable clothes to wear.</p>
<p>The location scenes of "Brothers' Walk" are very beautiful. The scenery of Putuo and Zhaopu are included in the lens.</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen plays a professor in "Brothers' Walk". Shu's performance is quite sophisticated and calm. She is an actor who can play many different personalities.</p>
<p>The first issue of the fourth volume of "Star Semi-Monthly" is a collection of "Brothers' Walk" and "Peach Blossoms After the Calamity". Zhang Jinxing took many beautiful photos of "Brothers' Walk".</p>
<p>"Brothers' Walk" started showing at the Jincheng Grand Theater yesterday. All three shows on the first day were sold out. The film market is still prosperous.</p>
<p>"Brothers' Walk" is a tragedy. It was secretly screened at the Central Grand Theater the other day. Most of the viewers were tearful.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Comparison of Ancient and Modern Song of Everlasting Regret <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>One is a poet and the other is an artist. Shi Dongshan is not inferior to Bai Xiangshan</p>
<p>Bai Juyi of the Tang Dynasty once wrote the Song of Everlasting Regret, praising the Tang Emperor's love for his concubine, Yang Guifei. The entanglement and sadness caused many sentimental people in the world to read it and shed tears. However, in the lines, there was quite a bit of sarcasm towards the Tang Emperor for valuing women and neglecting the country. Director Shi Dongshan wrote and directed the Song of Everlasting Regret for Xinhua, describing how aspiring young people in modern society work hard for their lives and have no time to offer hospitality to their bedside companions, causing misunderstandings and creating great tragedies. Although its meaning is very different from Bai Juyi's Song of Everlasting Regret, the tragedy and hatred are the same, just like what Bai Juyi said, "Heaven and earth will eventually come to an end, but this hatred will last forever!" Moreover, Director Shi satirizes the sinister and treacherous nature of people in industry and commerce, jealousy and competition; they do not know how to close their own doors and create their own unique style. They only know how to imitate and compete to lower prices and sell cheaply, disregarding costs and credit. As a result, the entire industry and commerce falls to the ground and cannot be recovered. Director Shi has such awareness and also adopts the romance of ancient stories to form this great tragedy. The protagonist Wang Renmei sings the Song of Everlasting Regret in the film with a desperate and moving voice, even better than Fishing Light Serenade.</p>
<h3 id="e233">New Song of Everlasting Regret <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>

<p>The first rehearsal of "Flowers and Plants" started yesterday.</p>
