<p>（東京）據此間獲悉、英政府已决定指派衆議院保守黨議員柏特里克氏Pntrick為駐滬特派員、以促進英國對中國之貿易、柏特里克氏卽將取道日本赴華、聞英政府準備允許與中國以輸出信用放欵、（十三日中央社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外傳英國政府曾與中國政府代表開始談判、俾中國得在倫敦市塲覓獲借欵、此項消息頃由官塲人士予以否認、政界人士則謂、中英兩國金融界正在談判中、但尚未商之各該國政府云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— 宜</p>
<p>中日國交上最大的障碍。無疑的就是日本軍人在華北所造成的一切『旣成事實』了。現在兩國外交當局正在絞着腦汁。圖謀國交的調整。日本軍人似乎還要加緊製造新的侵略事實。使兩國的裂痕加深。這是我們不能不覺得遺憾的。據綏遠電訊。日本軍人日前又嗾使了察匪王英部。進犯綏東興和。这次侵擾雖因傅作義部的奮勇防禦。仍未得逞。但是就此可見日本决計要在短期內侵占綏遠。以完成併呑內蒙計畫的最後階段了。</p>
<p>日本併呑內蒙的野心。早就表現於興安劃分四省的時候。此後日本一面覇縻着內蒙的封建王公。一面收買着士匪和漢奸。竭力要使察綏兩省跟我國分離。去年德王受了日人的挾制和利用。在比錫廟實布獨立。偽軍李守信部又佔領了察北六縣。在張北設立軍政府。把縣制改為盟制。於是我國的內蒙領土實際上已經淪亡了大半。現在連僅存的綏遠和察南。也在日本軍事布置的嚴重的威脅之下了。</p>
<p>然而便是到了今日。我們却也不能對內蒙的前途絕粱的。我們須知內蒙人民不但在國際法理上。决不能跟中華民族分離。而且由於他們自身的覺悟。也還要竭力抵抗侵略勢力的壓迫。這從以往的事實就可以得到不少的證明。日本挾制了德王。來號召各盟旗。反而促成了蒙古政委會的解體。和百靈廟敎導隊的反正。此其一。興安偽政府高級官吏凌陞等四人。因為當地蒙人反對徵兵和沒收牧塲的緣故。被日人槍决。這事件使各盟旗蒙人深感到日本『善隣』宣傳的虛偽。綏境蒙古各盟旗政委會的成立。據說就是因此促成的。此其二。今年偽軍李守信部擁有日本所。供給的現代武器。屢次進犯陶林。都被綏遠蒙軍擊退。此共三。</p>
<p>蒙古人的反抗的情緖。顯已使日本併蒙政策遭遇了不少的波折。現在日本奪取綏遠的工作。也因此規畫得很巧妙很周密。最近小隊匪部的遊擊式的侵擾正是日後大舉進犯的準備。平綏路日軍的活動。正是要使綏遠防軍陷於孤立的布置。而月初德王在嘉卜寺召開的軍事會議。也有着嚴重的意味。</p>
<p>今日的情勢。愈加證實着日本為要完成併蒙政策。對淤綏遠。是志在必得的。日本併蒙的目標。在一方面固然在包圍外蒙。以威脅蘇聯。在另一方面還在奠定華北的根據地。進而染指於我國中原。所以綏遠的存亡對於世界和平和中國前途是有莫大的關係的。為了世界的和平。為了不可侵犯的領土主權。我們非盡全力來保全垂危的綏遠不可。我們深信只要全國人民有着共同的决心。那麽殘破的內蒙還是可以挽救的。</p>

<p>大連通訊、日人之所以亡東北者、以滿鐵為生命錢、以關東州為根據地、自中日及日俄戰後、關東州卽完全淪於日人統治下、日人舉凡對滿蒙有何企圖曁侵略、均由關東州策源發動、如九一八事變、卽其一例、今東北淪亡五載、而日人統治關東州已垂三十年、現在州內情形、已完全日本化、茲將州內各種人口·產業·等狀况、分誌如後、以告國人、</p>
<p>人口</p>
<p>關東州之人口、據日人然去年（日本昭和十年）調查為一百十三萬四千零七十四人、內日本人為十六萬三千七百九十六人、朝鮮人為四千三百八十九人、華人為九十六萬三千八百七十五人、外國人為二百零四人、視三十年前（日本明治三十八年）之調查、人口三十七萬四千七百八十五人、其中日本人五千零三十五人、中國人三十六萬九千七百二十六人、外國人三十四人於此比較下、總人口殆增加三倍、其中日本人加三十四倍之多、中國人僅增二倍有餘、</p>
<p>農業畜產業</p>
<p>自日本統治後之主要農業、卽落花生·及果樹、落花生栽植面積為三萬四千餘町步、收穫額四百萬元、其大部分皆輸出、果樹栽培面積五千一百餘町步、收穫額五百六十萬貫、價額二百八十萬元、主要者乃蘋果、現在長成稚樹者、收穫額有達四倍之希望、至於栽培棉花、又為日本國策上重要產業、多年來、關東農事試騐塲研究結果、關束州及南滿洲之栽培、適於陸地棉早熟種「關農一號」改良品種、可告完成、此種為普及州內及南滿洲一帶、又今日州內之家禽、日人大肆宣揚讚美、認為已變優良種、就中豚·牛·馬·改良、尤為顯著、</p>
<p>鹽業</p>
<p>關東州之鹽業、亦為最特色之重要產業、關東州之氣像狀態、恰適於日晒鹽、且凡治岸所到之處，隨地均可製造、自古以來、卽為產鹽區域、後於日人始政時、共規模不大、存有中國鹽田一千二百町步、現據日人宣稱、已達八千六百五十餘町步、（內九成為日人經營）至於產鹽額、去年（日本昭和十年）收達八億四千萬斤、卽四十七萬噸生產之多</p>
<p>工商業</p>
<p>關東州內之工業、中產額者、為線系·蔴袋·洋灰·硝子·豆油·曁油類製材等、據日人昭和八年底之工塲統計數、（五人以上之職工使役者）為五百五十七、總　資本金七千二百餘萬元、年產　為六千九百萬元、</p>
<p>水產業</p>
<p>關東州三面臨海、而圍繞之海岸綫、總畏達七百餘浬、島嶼之數、大小有四十餘、且沿岸富於灣澳、舟楫之便、魚產允為豐富、考其沿革、於日本明治三十八年九月、日俄戰役之結果、關東州乃為日本帝國强迫租借地、於是易俄房產移住日人者甚多、故對於魚類需要亦頓增、當時為此供給日人行漁者、通年不下一千三百人、又據日人官稱、日人慣於漁法者加多、而大正十四年、渤海·龍口海峽、以鯛業為目的之日本內地機船、大舉下底曳網漁以來、現在日人獲漁額占八成、皆依此漁業法、今關東州租借後、卽明治三十九年與昭和八年之水產比較觀之、可以窺斯之進展、（漁獲額為貫）</p>
<p>日本明治三十九年　三七五、五三八</p>
<p>日本昭和八年　一三、五二〇、〇〇〇</p>
<p>又日人漁業者、以大連旅順二港為根據地、並以近海島嶼相互七百餘浬、槪為漁塲、又日淸戰役有名之海洋島、在長山列島之東端、擁有天然良港、現在成捕魚者之根據地、其重要水族、為鯛·鱈·太刀魚　·　·平目鰈·鱸·鯔·鯖·　·　·穴子·鰻·石首魚等數十種、又關東州內對於水產業之指導、亦極完備、</p>

<p>— 兪慶棠主編</p>
<p>泰興農村守望所（下）　啟鳳</p>
<p>我暑假期中在家鄉親身經歷的是如此。據家中人告訴我，他們除掉不明不白的敲詐鄉民外，還有公然立出許多剝削的名目，使老百姓哭笑不得的。例如做壽募捐等就是很顯明的例子。聽說我鄉做壽的人，每年眞不知有多少。鄉長要做壽，保長要做壽，國董要做壽，其中要以「局長」做壽做得最勤，和最合算。「局長」每年做壽至少要有三四决，自己做了壽，再替兒子做壽，兒子做了壽，再替死掉一二十年的母親做冥壽。「局長」每决做壽時，不是等候人家自由登門慶賀，是要由保甲長挨村攤派賀儀送去的。每次壽儀的收入，少說也有五六百元！除掉做壽是募捐，開始是槍械捐，槍械捐過去了就是冬防捐，冬防捐每年都有一次，每决五百元。貧苦的農民大衆那裏負擔得起追筆欽子呢？</p>
<p>暑假一結束，我就走到外鄉來了。關於守望所的種種德政，除掉在報紙上偶見一二記載外並沒有在家時那樣曉得詳細了。最近，家裏的來信說，我們的「局長」犯了通匪罪，被縣政府捉住解到鎭江去了。並說當「局長」被捉進城去的一天。「局長」的徒子徒孫起了一個極大的紛擾，他們深恐「局長」將一去不能回來，大家都到各村莊上威脅着許多鄉民丟開鋤頭，帮助他們到城裏去請願，鄉民心裏雖然慶幸地方上少了一個壞人，但是受着這班黨羽的威脅，他們又不得不跟到城裏去，七百餘人擠在城隍廟裏餓了大半天，後來也沒有聽到頭緒，又一個個的私下逃回去了。</p>
<p>上面所說的完全是我們家鄉守望所的種種情形，至於其他各處的守望所是不是也是如此呢？我可不敢說，但我在九月裏的江北某縣的地方報紙上，看見一段「頃聞各鄉守望所有私借槍械給匪行刦之事殊屬非法……」的布告，可見和我鄉的也差不多。至於守望所接到這種皇皇布告後有沒有歸正，下面有兩段新聞可以答覆。</p>
<p>一、五區杜鞠鄉財神廟住持僧福祥，前年有該區張鳳鄉管家莊之戴裕壽，拜該僧為義子，故僧將裕壽介紹至杜家莊小學讀書，上月底裕壽因事回家，多日未曾去校，日前該校校長葉榮賓，卽着該僧前去催喚，甫至裕壽家中，大雨驟至未克回歸，該且守望所所丁管太幷肖正新等持槍至裕壽家內。聲謂爾家有異鄉人到家，為何不向保長報告，非重罰不可。當鳴槍兩下，恫嚇百般，後經該保保長肯映光與村民肖映書等調解，由戴裕壽寫出十元憑票，始行放罷。</p>
<p>二、一區耿戴鄉蕭灣莊蕭德參因吸烟成癮，昨着决女珍女往城購土，回家時路過房家莊守望所，忽被强人將十搶去，珍女以年幼無力抵禦，遂大哭而回。</p>
<p>關於我們江北守望所的非法行動，現在也不願再寫下去了。我們辦理守望所的目的，顧名思義，統是要他們相助，要他們保衛鄉里，現在他們不但不能帮助鄉里，保衛鄉里　反而變成一個敲詐剝削民食的機關，遝有何話可說？有人說：江北守望所所以為害地方如此，其因不外三點，一是主任不是正正當當的人充任的；二是所丁不是地方上的農民自己擔任的；三是所丁每月只有三塊錢的收入，待遇太少了，這話我們也承認。但守望所所以這樣的組織，還是地方上封建惡勢力所釀成，我們勰為地方封建惡勢力是一禍根，而守望不過是這禍根表現出來的一種姿態；如禍根不去，守望所將永遠成為剝削農民大衆的工具！</p>
<p>註一，「局長」是農民對於守望所主任的稱謂，主任也往往以「局長」自稱的。</p>
<p>註二，「烟燈」是農對於雅片吸食所的俗稱</p>

<p>— 吳城</p>
<p>十月十二日在市立體專開學禮訓詞</p>
<p>（中央社）各位來賓、各位同學、今天是上海市立體育專科學校舉行開學典禮、本人兼任本校校長、覺得非常榮幸、</p>
<p>上海市政府所以要設立這個驟育專科學校、其用意是很深切、很遠大的、雖然、現在上海市地方財政是如此拮据、但是我們為何在目前這種情形之下、竟毅然决然的來創辦這個體育專門學校呢、這個動機、我是很早就有了、在上海市政府計劃建築運動塲的時候、我已經有道個意思、那是就想在運動塲裏附設一個體育學校、來充分的利用這個大運動塲、因為這個運動塲、不但在中國是最大的一個運動塲、同時至今日為止、也是遠東的一個最大的運動塲、我們旣然建築了這樣大的一個運動場、我們就不能使這個運動塲空虛着、而不去利用他、並且在這樣偉大而設備比較完備的一個運動塲、來附設一個體育學校、將來辦理、也可較為便利、所以在前年市政府迎築運動塲的時候、我已經有了這個意思、但是為什麼到今日才來設立這個體育學校呢、第一就是經費問題、第二是時局關係、今日的經濟、當然還是和從前一樣的困難、今日的時局、也不見得比從前好、那麼我們究竟為什麼令日毅然來設立這個體育學校呢、是有一個最大的衝動在、就是此决中國代表隊參加世界運動大會、使我們受到一個最大的羞恥、給了我們一個最大的敎訓、我們所認為羞恥的、並不是因為中國代表隊得不到分數、而是我們的體格、與世界各國來比較、相差實在太遠、幾不可以道里計、這一點、實在可說就是中國亡國滅種的隱憂之所在、就是沒有外患、如果我們全國人民的體格如此衰弱下去、我們這個民族、就將不能和人家競爭、將不能適存於今日的激烈競爭的世界之上、這一點、給我們的刺激最大、所以使我們不顧一切、無論財政怎樣困難、時局怎樣惡劣、我們仍毅然决然把這個體育學校成立起來、</p>
<p>我們這個體育學校、是有其特殊精神的、現在一般人的謬見、以為辦體育學校、其目的在造就運動選手、來標榜學校、這種觀念、是非常錯誤、非常危險的、我們所以要提倡體育、其月的並不單純在造就選手，更不　在參加運動會、才辦體育學校、我們要用種種方法、　　方面來鍜鍊健全的體格、使全國人民的體格同樣的健全起來、全國人民的體格都健全了之後、我們再在全國人民的健全的體格當中、來挑選出優秀的選手來參加運動會、絕對不是倒因為果的為參加運動會、才來造就選手、而且嚴格的說、我們的選手、應當要從全國人民無論那一個職業當中挑選出來、這樣產生的選手，才足以眞正代表道樣强大的民族、因此我們對於時下錯誤的體育方針、不能不力加糾正、因為我們提倡體育的最大目的、就是要鍜鍊全體國民個個人都有一個健全的體格、使全國人民可以各自的以其健全體格、去從事各自的事業、使他所從事的事業、有成功的把握、如果全民族各個份子的體格健全事業又能成功、則整個民族、又何患不能復興發展、外國人常常譏笑我們中國人為「東亞病夫」、為什麽外國人譏笑我們中國人為「東亞病夫」呢、為什麼我們給人家來譏笑之後、我們不知恥辱、不知振作呢、因為我們始終看不淸楚自已的病、究竟何在、中國古代本來是文武兼重的、所以狩獵與讀書並重、騎射與禮樂同工、到了宋朝以後、六藝盡廢、專習文字銓註之學、從此以後養成了一種重文輕武的風氣、人民體格日衰、所以被人稱為「東亞病夫」了、而我們自己還不知道我們自己的病在什麼地方實在危險、一般淺見的人、以為中國及有强有力的海軍，沒有精銳的空軍、沒有新式的大砲、與堅固的要塞、所以被人家稱為「東亞病夫」、因此天天要求政府擴充軍備、抵抗外侮、當然、軍備很要緊、但是飛機能够自己飛的麼、軍艦能够自己行駛嗎、軍械堡壘能够自己充分發揮戰鬥能力嗎、這些都是要有人去駕駛和使用的、可是人在那裏呢、是不是體格虛弱不健全的人可以去駕駛呢、會有精神有勇氣去、耐勞指揮呢、所以倘使人的體格不健全、飛機軍艦與大砲也是無用的、現在我們大多數人民還是不以被人家稱為「東亞病夫」為恥辱、還是不知道如何的去振作、如何的去求自拔實為民族莫大的隱憂、蔣委員長憂心及此、所以要提倡新生活運動、來振發全國民衆的精神、從根本上來去掉這個「東亞病夫」的名稱、現在我們全國人民的生活、充分的表現出傲慢苟安·怠惰·懦怯·散漫·凌亂·自暴自棄、自私自利、等秤種病態、這樣生活的民族、怎麼樣不弱、怎麼樣不亡怎麼樣不遭人家的欺侮、勵行新生活最主要最根本的工作、應當從體育着手、因為敎育部規定體育的目標、是在養成服從耐勞·自治·勇敢·團結·互助·守紀律等各種美德、如果能够養成服從的美德、就可以一掃過去傲慢的病態、如果能够養成耐勞的美德、就可以一掃過去苟安怠惰的病態、如果能够養成自治的美德、就可以一掃過去自暴自棄的病態、如果能够養成勇敢的美德、就可以一掃過去懦怯的病態、如果能够養成互助的美德、就可以一掃過去自私自利的病態、如果能够養成守紀律的美德、就可以一掃過去凌亂的病態、總之我們要將過去的種種病態一起從根拔去、而代之以服從·耐勞·自治·勇敢·團結·互助守紀律等美德、如果我們全民族的每一個份子都能具備了這種種美德、我們的民族定能够很快的復興起來、這是我們體育的最高目標、此外各位應注意的、就是今後的體育應與軍事打成一片、歐戰以後各國體育方針、與前不同、共敎材與方法、均着重在激勵民挨奮鬥的精神、除强健靑年及民衆的身心外、復有寓兵於體育的目的、如意大利則以體育為復興民族的急務、如蘇俄、則以運動會、視為全國民衆的「生產與國防的考試、」所以本校的設立、並不是僅僅在造就幾個優秀的運動員、而是要造就體育與軍事合一的師資、並且要進而謀普及體育於民衆、使全國人民的體魄都很健全、使本校的將來、能够成為一個民衆體育的中心、今天開學以後、希望校長敎職員與全體學生、大家澈底明瞭政府之所以要設立此校的意思認淸我們的目標、共同努力、以完成其所負的使命、（完）</p>

<p>決定辦法</p>
<p>昨日下午四時在寗波同鄕會開會、計到秦潤卿·傅彼庵·虞洽卿·竺梅光·孫衡甫·俞佐廷·金廷蓀·徐聖禪樂振葆張繼堯·方椒伯·毛和源·等十餘人、由虞洽卿主席、報告購辦積穀宗旨畢、當經商定辦法如下、（一）購備積穀之數量、約計國幣一百五十萬元、（二）以購進之穀向銀行（未定）折抵押、利息（未定）釐、由省政府保息、（三）除以穀抵押外、應須熱欵三十萬元、由協會各會員向某某銀行借入墊付、各按其所借之數、分別負責、其利息公定為（未定）釐、（四）積穀賣出後、如有虧蝕、由省政府與墊欵人各半負擔、卽於其墊欵中經算淸償、</p>

<p>應須塾欵三十萬元、卽席認定者、計有虞洽卿五千元、徐聖禪五千元、張繼堯五千元、樂振葆五千元、金廷蓀五千元、傅筱庵五千元、俞佐廷五千元、孫衡甫五千元、毛和源五千元、竺梅先五千元、秦潤卿五千元、方椒伯五千元、瞻園五千元、共計六萬五千元尚餘二十三萬五千元决向旅滬同鄉勸認、</p>

<p>新聲社云、上海市社會局為穩定民食價格、訓令荳米業公會等防止高漲、並呈報市府、轉中央禁止出口、各糧食　體、已自動防止高漲及出口、並條陳限制運往各地辦法、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>禁止出口</p>
<p>社會局自召集各糧食團體會議穩定米價後、除訓令荳米業同業公會等、飭屬防止米麥麵粉等高漲外、並將會議經過及所决定之兩　穩定辦法、由局長潘公展向市政會議提出報告、同時呈報市政府、轉呈中央、對米麥麵粉等禁止出口、以維民食、一面由該局第四科民食股、隨時派幹員赴各處監視、對故意抬高者、决予嚴懲、</p>
<p>制止飛漲</p>
<p>上海市社會局訓令荳米業同業公會等團體海字第三六二號云、查近日食糧價格飛漲、影饗本市民食非淺、據查本年各地糧食豐收、產量增加、且連日到貨並未减少、値此新貨登塲時期、不應有此現象、本局為維護平民生計起見、未便漠視、除派員澈查有無投機操縱情事、一經查實、卽予懲處外、合亟令仰該公會遵照、切實制止糧價飛漲、以重民食、切切此令、</p>
<p>糧價穩定</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晨往訪雜糧業領袖顧馨一氏、據談、自社會局召集各糧食團體議决穩定辦法後、雜糧荳米等業同業公會、卽飭各會員制止糧價高漲、目前糧價已回跌、較最高時每石約低四五角、以前高漲之原因、實為時局謠言所致、此係一時現象、因我國今年各地、晚稻均告豐收、不致發生缺乏之虞、所以實無飛漲之理、</p>
<p>同盟拒絕</p>
<p>並為防止我國米麥麵粉等出口起見、今雜糧荳米麵粉等同業、均已自動拒絕外商購買、如最近某商又於滬埠採辦大批小麥、因我國商人均拒絕出售、以致無法收買、至於目前小麥及麵粉之價格、較前為高、原因為洋麥價格高漲、以致我國小麥隨之提高、</p>
<p>調節民食</p>
<p>又雜糧業為調節國內民食及防止出口起見、主張如需將糧食運出、必須經同業公會之證明、發給運貨憑證、方准起運、如遇供不應求時期、公會得停止發給准運憑證、此項辦法、將由公會呈請管官署、希望批准云云、</p>

<p>糾紛原因</p>
<p>據記者探悉、該會此次糾紛確為新會員之資格問題、惟其實質則為政商之衝突、緣該會成立時、會員僅二十餘人、其組織之性質、側重於技術之研究、本次舉行大會時、報到入會者、增加至百餘人、彼等對政府於年來施行之紅茶運銷政策、向頗不滿、擬在該會中指定議案、加以反對、故問題之發生、卒形成政商術突之局面</p>

<p>依該會簡章之規定、新會員經會員兩人之介紹、並經理事會之通過、始得為會員、此次同時加入者達百餘人、因理事會之疏忽、故未加審查、而第一次討論時、由到會會員全體表决、且新會員亦有被推為審查委員、旋理事會見將發生意外之變化、乃援用簡章、以為補救之意、竟遭新會員之指責、而使會議中止進行、</p>

<p>—公安局飭屬嚴緝兇犯—</p>
<p>本報新聞活版部工友戈關福、昨日下午三時許、突遭淫妻姦夫、用菜刀砍斷喉管、當塲斃命、迨樓上房客聞聲、急奔下樓、鳴同崗警追趕、但兩兇手卒被兎脫、詳情分述如下</p>
<p>少年老誠</p>
<p>戈關福、一名福昌、江蘇吳縣人、現年三十五歲、在本報新聞活版部為排字、已歷九年之久、家住南市大吉路三多里第十一號單幢石庫門住房、自為二房東、住於樓下客堂、樓上則分租於人、戈天性純懦、少年老誠、平時待人接物、尤和靄可親、服務迄今、同事中從無間言、更因勤於工作、勇於職守、故每月所入、尚堪溫飽、</p>
<p>戈關福君遺影</p>
<p>續娶淫婦</p>
<p>戈之亡父、於去歲見背、後母同居一處、有三妹、兩已字人、一尚年幼、戈髮妻張氏、於民國二十二年正月間亡故、遺一女、名根弟、現方七歲、四年前戈續娶武進女子劉祥寳為偶、氏年三十一歲、兇狠悍潑、天性淫蕩、微聞與戈未婚之前、卽已姘人、而戈因一時受泳人巧言所朦蔽、遽續鸞膠、乃締婚未幾、家庭中迭起風波、同事中均代為惋惜、</p>
<p>逐姑姘漢</p>
<p>劉氏自適戈之後、竟欺戈之懦弱、時常反目、稍不愜意、卽發雌威、但戈始終忍受、不加抵抗、初不料謀殺之機、卽種因於此、前月二十日、劉氏又爆發淫威、將戈之後母毆辱一番、戈母震於兇燄、隨卽遷居於附近林蔭路三號暫住、戈因館中職務關係、每晚七時、卽須到館工作、翌晨方可工畢返寓、乃氏竟乘此機會、由氏之胞弟劉志生（現在法大馬路昇平里十一號大達布號為學徒、已於一星期前停歇、）之勾引、得與老北門附近一眼鏡店供職之武進人名林亞口者私通、終日出入於戈宅之門、並向戈僞稱為表兄妹、</p>
<p>控夫傷害</p>
<p>姦夫林某、乃一身着蹩脚式西裝拆白之流亞也、年的三十餘歲、每晚待戈到館工作之際、則林某卽作入幕之賓、戈固茫然弗知也、本月六日、戈與氏又因細故、發生爭鬥、氏於翌日卽逕赴南陽醫院騐傷、對戈提起傷害之訴、並要求每月三十元之贍養費於上海地方法院、戈亦儗提起反訴傳票業已接到、將於今日下午二時開審、但同居鄰人、均願為戈作公正之瞪人、不料慘劇竟於昨日午後三時發生、而九日上午、戈與妹夫兩人、尚同至醫院勸氏出院、氏卒未允、</p>
<p>來館四囂</p>
<p>迨至十一日晚八時許、劉氏忽親來報館尋戈、當時同至三馬路亞洲旅社寄宿一宵、翌日氏仍欲續住一夜、惟戈因工作攸關、力持不允、遂於下午四時、一齊返家、至七時許、戈擬到館工作、詎氏竟糾纏呌囂不休、不讓戈出門一步、戈無奈、遂滯留在家、致館中未曾請假、而遭犯規、同時工作同人、甚加疑慮、蓋素稔戈平日向不無故怠工也、</p>
<p>突下毒手</p>
<p>在前日戈與氏自亞洲旅社返家時、戈之兩妹、已向各方尋訪多時、一見兄嫂歸來、且細察劉氏面帶愉色、遂不疑有他、乃各自返家、至昨晨八時許、戈與氏一同出外、至下午三時回寓、並購得新履兩雙、詎未及一刻鐘之久、樓上房客周大同、正在午寢、突聞樓下發現異響、自夢中驚起、趕奔下樓、惟樓下闐無一人、乃入戈之臥室、祗見戈身穿白布衫袴白襪新履、已倒臥血泊中、</p>
<p>死者慘狀</p>

<p>—檢視官論吿應從重處刑—</p>
<p>兆豐路二百九十號虹口女科醫院醫生上海人張文華、年廿七歲、及其姘婦助手看護陳小寳（卽梁梅玉、又名許淑珍、年廿五歲、上海人、）因於本年九月四號、將打胎女子四川人陸愛　及男子兪根生二人謀斃、埋尸於地下、案發被匯山捕房華探長周桂森、探目崔誠克·黃福根·等、於本月二號、在法租界　悌路四五五弄十三號樓上亭子間內、將張文華·陳小寳·</p>
<p>二人拘獲解送第一特院、捕房依照刑法二七一條殺人罪提起公訴、業經特院一度訊問、兩被告均承認因張文華代陸愛麗打胎時、因心中受氣、故手術路重、致子宮破裂、血流不止、病勢垂危、同時俞根生向張交涉、遂起殺心、將俞用麻醉針注入、並用紗布將男女兩人勒斃不諱、諭候傳證再訊各情、已詳誌本報、昨晨此案又經鍾淸推事偕張宗儒檢察官蒞刑三庭續訊、到庭</p>
<p>旁聽男女仍極擁擠、兩被告則同延范剛·俞恩良·兩律師到庭代辯、卽據捕房律師張師竹起稱、上决奉庭諭飭傳之各證、今除女傭費王氏已回無錫外、其餘均已到案、請訊、乃據證人陳鵬飛投稱、年二十三歲、上海人、家住北四川路仁智里七〇四號、被告陳小寳、係我胞姊、張文華為我之東家、我在張處為汽車夫、於本年八月二十九號起、在張處服務、張原名老王、故我平日</p>
<p>呼為老王虹口女科醫院、卽係兩被告所開、又據證人楊裕富供、在兆豐路一八八號禮拜堂為更夫、虹口醫院之餘屋、係張文華來租借、陳小寳為張之妾、又據塘山路二〇三號匯元祥五金店經理任立金證明陳小寳於九月四號淸早、到來購買鉛皮六張、共計五元三角、又據新記洪路八十九號泰肥石灰店出店譚錫泉證明、九月四號上午九時、陳小實偕一十一二歲之女孩同來</p>
<p>購買石灰一百五十磅、計一元四角、又據兆豐路三一四號陳林記木匠店之陳林昌證稱、虹口女科醫院、卽在我店之斜對面、故與張文華相識、某日晨、張來借鐵梗一根、謂用以撬木板、我乃借給、至翌晨歸還各等語、詰之張文華等、對於各證所言、均無異議、惟稱抄案之鈔幣九百餘元、均係平日積蓄所得、且分存於銀行中、自案發後、卽向浙江興業銀行提去</p>
<p>三百餘元金城銀行提去百餘元、合計四百五十元、以作生活之用、查該男女兩死者、確為四川人、惟來自何處、則因打胎、事關秘密、不肯言明、女尸身畔共有四十元、除付去打胎費三十五元外、尚餘五元、故實非謀財害命、此點盡可調查、自埋尸後、即於九月七號遷至敏體尼蔭路敏邨六號門牌、因我之診所、除虹口醫院外、尚在南京路</p>
<p>大陸商塲三樓三一五號、向侯光迪醫生租得餘屋、月租二十元、專治普通病症、另在法租界八里橋路三七〇號設立診所、故自案出事後案發前、仍至八里橋應診、大的於九月十號、有一女子到來打胎、收得手續費五十元、現捕房在我處抄出之全部木器等物、請交南市高昌廟廣東街維德里三十九號父親張金生收云云、此際捕房律師張師竹卽起稱、上次庭訊時、兩被告雖供認</p>
<p>用麻醉針打死俞·陸·二人後、再以紗布勒斃、但據法醫之報告、騐得兩死者委係被勒身死、故究竟被勒而死、抑係已死再勒、應請訊問、鍾推事乃詢據張文華、詎張忽然翻供、謂女子陸愛麗、確因於打胎時我略一不愼、將子宮弄破、血入肚中、形成貧血之現象、昏迷不醒、勢已垂危、其時俞根生在樓下打鈴、我下樓、卽向我大起交涉、我以如欲補救、須</p>
<p>抽血灌入女體、乃乃至樓上用針抽血、不料拉抽血時、略不經心、將空氣吸入俞之血管中、致俞身死、迨下樓則見隨亦已死去、為防臭氣及流質冲出、乃用紗布繞頸、幷非勒死、如當時果有勒死情事、則俞等當然須加抵抗、更夫楊裕富卽睡在隔室、豈有不聞聲響之理、故對於該兩人之死、實因一時不愼、</p>
<p>幷非故意謀死、我今日所供、均屬眞實、毫無虛僞、上次所供、因被捕時受驚胡供云云、持之陳小寳、亦稱陸愛麗因打胎而死、俞根生為抽血而死、我昔在金神父路廣慈醫院實習看護三月、與張姘識二年有餘等語、庭上核供、以本案事實已經明瞭、乃諭開始辯論、先由捕房律師張師竹起稱、查兩被告專以打胎為常業、且此種行為、使人</p>
<p>毫無抵抗而加以謀害、手段毒辣、應請處以極刑、末由被告律師范剛·俞恩良·起而辯稱、按照本案歷次審理情形、兩被告實無故意殺人行為、且本案係由墮胎起因、應請依照業務過失墮胎罪判斷且陳小寳懷孕在身、亦請於生養後執行刑期云云、而張檢官</p>
<p>論吿意見云、照本案情形、非比普通殺人案、被告等非但以滑頭醫生殺人以人命為兒戲、核其行為、竟同盜匪之開設黑店、在殺人以後、復毀尸滅跡、手段殊屬毒辣若不嚴重處刑、殊不足以維社會之人心及法律之保障云云、鍾推事諭本案辯論終結、定本月二十日上午宜判、兩被告仍分別還押、</p>

<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>誰也知道，這幾年來我國龐大的入超，那是造成我們民族經濟破產的致命傷，而在現下，當這我國經濟的國難，這樣嚴重的時候，我們必需要「消滅入超」和「提倡儉的，」那是挽救國民經濟危機的唯一要圖，在整個國民經濟的建設運動中，我們是必定要一面發展國產，來消滅入超，一面實行節的，來增加國力，這是富國强民的基本的條件。</p>
<p>然而，在過去，每年龐大的入超，其中却正包含着許多的舶來奢侈品，像香水，脂粉化妝品，眞假首飾，捲烟，雪茄烟，各種酒類，汽水，糖果，魚翅，燕窩等類，這許多高貴的東西，在民窮財盡的今日，本來是不應該再有這樣大量的消耗了，但事實勝於雄辯。在最近——九月三十日的申報上，我們就還看到本年八個月，單是烟酒兩項的進口，就達一千二百餘萬元之鉅，捲烟輸入，且較去年很見激增，我想這是無論誰也不會滿意，而覺得國貨運動的前途，尚須更大的努力吧！</p>
<p>所以在同日的報上，我們又看到實業部吳部長本月廿九日在首都中央廣播電台發表的「節的運動」演講辭，我覺得十分首肯的，他很扼要地明白地指出中國每年關於衣食住物品的消耗，要達三萬六千萬元，就此一點而論，已足見中國經濟的危機，而今後，我們務須人人節省物力，以蓄積國力，物力能省若干，卽增加國力若干，並說明假使每年每人能節省一元，全年就可增添四萬萬元國民經濟的活力云云，這許多話，是十分沉痛，肯切，値得我們每個人的猛省的。</p>
<p>最後，我抱着熱烈的希望，要當前的「節的運動」，先從拒用舶來奢侈品做起，並與整個的提倡國貨運動，聯槃起來，要大家認識時艱，痛下决心，省吃儉用，努力生產建設，以「减少入超」，而至完全「消滅入超」，為國貨前途，開一新的路綫，這纔是救國救自己的根本計劃呵！</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>芥視千金語，如公合鑄金，覇陵卅載業，藥錄一生心。慘澹塞巵漏，思量起陸沈，是眞不龜手，艱鉅力能任。夜半干戈起，鶯花慘不春，纓冠蹈虎尾，抗節犯龍鱗，已遂成仁志，難忘創業辛。報崇留永念，忠勇史常新。</p>
<p>此筆者詠松茂紀念堂落成詩也。吾人祝五洲之三十周紀念，祝十層新厦落成，孰若紀念松茂先生殉國之紀念，為最有意義，最有價値。松茂先生遺留於國家社會一腔愛國精神，其偉大無可與比，更永永不可磨滅也。黃任之先生謂「五洲十層大厦之基礎，建築於松茂先生忠勇兩字之上，卽建築於忠勇殉國之精神」。王曉籟先生謂「今日數萬人來此，感念非歆於十層大厦，亦非羨茲三十載之大事業，實為松茂先生殉事業與殉國精神所吸引而來」。均屬至有價値之言。松茂先生從事國貨事業三十年，至性過人，一介不苟，視公司中人如家人子弟，一聞公司中人被捕，劍及屨及，躬往營救，卒罹於難，而視死如歸臨難不苟免之精神，允可以風末俗勵後生。五洲事業發揚光大，能有今日之成績者，謂先生心血之結晶也可，謂先生之志勇精神所瀰滿也可。先生平日有自勵語三十字，允可傳誦，而永永不滅。句云：</p>
<p>平居宜寡慾養身，臨大節則達生委命。</p>
<p>治家須量入為出，徇大義當芥視千金。</p>
<p>卽此三十字，可以見松茂先生之為人，而五洲事業之發皇光大，正未有艾也。所願在事者以先生之志為志，以先生之存心為心，並以先生之待人處世為法則，則先生死而不死也。不但此也，此後五洲之事業，宜如何改進出品，以勝於舶來，如何减低成本，以嘉惠病人，如何就中藥而研究之，以精益求精，融合中藥西藥於一爐，而益神其用，此皆先生未竟之志，而有待於今之當局完成之。能如是，豈僅五洲之幸，國貨界之光，亦中華民國之榮也。</p>

<p>— 清波</p>
<p>中國火柴梗片廠，不止一處，所用木材亦不止一種，但均利用券刨，其外層鄭下之皮，及內心鄭剩之木棍，向來祗充燃料之用，甚為可惜。民國二十一年間，曾由利用造紙廠發起人陳蝶仙，（別號天虛我生）特向浙省光華火柴廠經理馮錫之，商請以前項廢料供給為該廠造紙之用，並經造出紙樣，寄示馮君，一為漂白料，一為本色料，均可以代木漿之用。惟因帶濕含水甚多，所得成分，不過百分之十三至十五，由杭運錫，川資殊不合算，故未實行，現因陳蝶仙已受浙省建設廳聘任，為改良紙料設計專員，在梵村着手建設爐灶灘塘，除采用竹料及野麻樹皮等外，因念火柴廢料，正可就近取材，爰託馮錫之君，重提舊議，業於本月二十五日，在西湖定香橋之蔣莊，議定價格，及月額數量，全由省立改良紙料廠承包消受。並由陳蝶仙允以製造方法，公開傳習，以便各地火柴廠同業同人，得以就地製成木漿，並得收買柴行及本行中，剝下樹皮，搭配成分，以資補充。而各處燒炭之木，亦得先去其皮，以製木漿銷售與各紙廠云。</p>

<p>— （徐小庭）</p>
<p>廣大的原野上，不描下優美的穀種，得不到豐滿的收穫，茫茫的人海裏，不求得高深的知識，做不出超絕的事業。</p>
<p>沒有偉大的勇氣，怎能使人們信仰？沒有優越的功績，怎能使歷史留名？環境可以轉變人生，人生也可以轉變環境，畏難，苟安，只能在環境周遭徘徊着，奮鬥，勇敢，方可跳出環境去做事。</p>
<p>試看歷史上的偉人，只會役使命運，却不會被命運役使。人生不是為享樂，是要在極平凡的過程上，留下幾點使後人景仰的史跡。</p>
<p>地球是不息的轉動，人生在地殼上，是平息的生長。有閒階級的朋友，是地殼上一粒霉爛的種子，吃苦耐勞的靑年，方是一顆充實的子粒。</p>
<p>社會是頹廢，人生是霉爛，享樂的仍然去享樂，畏難苟安的仍然是畏難苟安。這可憐寄生性質的生活，終有一日，要崩决潰裂，振作，改造，補救，我們不要希望人來帮助，我們要自己去設法拯救。</p>
<h3 id="c176">英雄 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>西方人，是被中國人在數十年前，譏嘲為野蠻人的，因為西方人，是英雄主義的崇拜者。獵人，騎士，都被視作英雄，甚至於海盜，也被列入於英雄之列。在那時候，我們中國，究竟還是文物之邦，同樣品級的武職，見了文官，還得爬下地去叩響頭。萬般皆下品，惟有讀書高。文質彬彬的，才是書香門第人家的子弟。拳頭大，臂膊粗的，不是販夫走卒，便是不安本份的强梁。</p>
<p>時至今日，英雄主義者，是抬頭了，叩開了文物之邦的大門了，於是乎大家才知蒙古式的騎士丰度，是靑年們所不該沒有的。灰白着顏面，傴僂着身體的書生公子，雖然會得筆尖兒橫掃五千人，但這不過是紙上空談而已，不吃香。惟有具有着蒙古式的騎士丰度的靑年，才可負起復興民族的重任</p>
<p>中國，本來也並不是一個甚麼文物之邦。在古代，我們的祖宗，也曾茹毛飲血過，也曾征服過毒蛇猛獸，也曾征服過遲開化的蚩尤。自從周代以後，歷史昭告着我們，歷朝的始祖皇帝，是沒有以搖筆桿，而得天下的。得天下的，都是抗着槍桿兒的出身。同時，任何一朝，要維持祖宗基業的，沒有不修武備的。惟有修着武備的，才可以內足以壓平反叛，外足以征服强鄰。末代君王，總都是只會吟詩作賦的好好先生。剛以克柔，這本是格物之至理。國家民族的盛衰興亡，自然也是逃不出這麼一個公式的。在這年頭兒大家都該覺悟着這已不是揖讓而治天下的時代了。</p>
<p>古語說，成則為王，敗則為寇。成王成寇，總還左右不失為英雄。拿破崙雖然兵敗而事業未成，但是拿破崙，是任誰都承認為是歷史上的英雄的。威廉二世，雖然兵敗而被放孤島，但也不失為英雄之一。到了最近，英雄主義，是瀰漫於整個地球了。而依歷史所昭告我人的，也惟有具有英雄主義的民族，才有發揚光大的希望。大家努力吧，惟英雄，乃可以身立而圖存。我們現在所需要的，是蒙古騎士式的，拳兒大，臂兒粗，能負衛國干城之責的靑年。</p>
<h3 id="c177">標準丈夫 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>「自己耐勞耐苦，只求妻子享福受用」。這類的標準丈夫，在我們人羣中是常常找得到的，可是在其他動物中很難尋覓。因為許多公性動物除了配偶繁生時盡了丈夫責任以外，其他事情，一槪抱着不聞不問主義。所以我常和友好掉着文說：「人之所以異於禽獸者，便是丈夫能盡責於妻子而已」，可是我近來見到兩件事情，竟把這句話攻破，因為禽獸中間也自有其標準丈夫，不信，且看下面所記的事：</p>
<p>友人某君的家裏，蓄着猴子一對，那是照着現行制度一夫一妻配合的，所以它們倆日常相倚相偎，倒也稱得起「賢伉儷」三個字。後來那牝猴紅潮不至，肚子膨脹，看上起是有弄璋之喜了。那時的公猴，緊守在旁，替伊剝菓子，捉蚤蝨，克盡慇懃侍奉的能事。後來小猴子出世，母猴除了哺乳以外，其他提携抱負，那位猴子爸爸着實盡了許多責任。我想這時的猴太太，一定在歡喜伊的丈夫能服侍和忠心咧！</p>
<p>近來在邑廟裏買了一對鴿子回來，也算家門有幸，不多幾天，那雌鴿子居然孵下了一雙小蛋。日常見到的禽類，孵蛋總是雌的責任，而那鴿子呢，倒是雙方共担：而孵蛋的時間，又是雄的居多。後來小鴿出來了，起先的半個月，不會自己啄食，一定要它的爸爸把吃下的食物，從喉中嘔出來，喂給孩子們吃；而鴿太太呢，却很逍遙自在，在日光裏洗刷羽毛，預備出一下風頭咧！</p>
<h3 id="c178">月餅式的命運 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 芝雲</p>
<p>月餅這東西，不知是誰發明的，裏面包着甜甜的饀子，意義眞是深長到了一百二十分，似乎在若干年前，已預知每一靑年男女，都愛着Sweet　beart也似的，豈非可怪。</p>
<p>月餅象徵着戀人，果然是再也確當不過的。但是現在的愛情的結合，幾乎十之八九，都不免於走上凶終隙末那一條路的。所謂甜甜蜜蜜，不可是在戀愛時期中的理想，以及在初結婚的時期中的一些兒感覺而已。日子一久，便都把愛情丟了，再各自去找新的戀人，新的刺激。</p>
<p>吃月餅，也正和這一回子事，掉在一個方式裏。未到嘴時，理想着月餅之甜，饑涎欲滴。正在吃的時候，甜得心花都開了，其味無窮。待到一枚旣盡，於是對此有深嗜的，便不得不再拈一個，送進嘴去。對於月餅的嗜好平庸的，那麼，一枚旣盡，便撂開手了。總之，月餅這東西，旣被咽下肚，便一切都完了。</p>
<p>於是我更佩服發明月餅的祖師爺的先見之明，竟把月餅製造得沒一些不合於數百年後之今日的男女戀愛關係的一切條件。</p>
<p>同時，月餅的形式，是圓圓的，滿像中秋晚上的明月。但明月豈能常圓？過了中秋，月是一天虧似一天了。月餅的外形像月，內心像愛情，無怪乎愛情也總是不能永久像中秋之月，而不能不像中秋月那麼的過中秋而漸晦。</p>
<p>花不能常好，月不能常圓，愛情不能歷久而不衰，——凡此種種，都可名之曰月餅式的命運」！</p>

<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>在日本最景氣的現在，各種娛樂，當然擁　不堪。歌舞伎座是東京最大的　院，和寳塚的歌舞，對峙着。平時表演古劇為多，有時以話劇為調劑。日本古劇和我國的京劇極像，詞句深奧，表演抽象，年輕的人便看不懂。我國人只能看他們的話劇，否則古劇中的鬼臉和長刀赤足的醜態，眞使人頭痛的。歌舞伎座的價格自五角起至四元不等，較電影貴十倍以上，前觀衆都是中等以上人。日本中流家訂婚前，男女必先看親，於是歌舞伎座的休息室，便成了的會的地方。</p>
<p>歌舞伎座的建築，外表完全是日本的宮殿式。最起碼的五角票，只能從側門出入，十足表演其階級觀念。票子在一星期前便出售的，顧客可以自己選擇座位，按號入座。節日星期，無不滿座。舞台淺而闊。和我國相反，座位因此較多。擊梆啟幕，台上以電光照明，表示晝夜時間。表演談話時，常佐以音樂及擬聲，如有聲電影。話劇以喜劇悲劇為多，表演動人較易。觀衆靜聽不譁，建築又極合理，故台上一詞一語，均能使觀者瞭然。休息時並無音樂，觀者都藉此出席休息吸烟。幕內搭配佈景時，仍鎚聲不絕，時間亦殊耗費。日本演劇習慣，凡每夜表演若干齣，名角必須屢决出塲。有時因勞苦太甚，只得扮些配角，聊以充數。所以在日本做名角。是十分辛苦的。還有顧客如若和演員有一面之交的，在看戲時，送了一張名片到後台去訪問一次。便有茶點糖果送出來，以答捧角之情，也是十分別緻的。</p>
<p>溥儀曾於去年遊日時，至歌舞伎座觀劇。於是院方替他佈置了一間臨時休息室，至今保存着，名之曰御座，大有廣告趣味，休息室帝，附有商店，宛如百貨公司，中國西洋及日本飯菜均全。因日本演戲自下午四時起，直至深夜為止，非在院中進餐不可。以前均吃飯盒，現在附設食堂，很便利了。食堂之外，各商店出售各種雜物，以化妝品女優照片為紀念。另有展覽會，陳列劇本底稿，揷圖，作者生活，舞台佈置，劇情片斷等，於是觀衆又得一個消閑的去處了。地下室中附設臨時托兒所，照相館等。托兒所內　有兒童床褥，由看護監護。帶有嬰孩的婦女，很感便利。我國戲院中的喧譁嘈雜，使身心不得舒服，是必須改良與防止的。</p>

<h3 id="c181">沙面風景綫 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 王珍</p>
<p>廣州的沙面，自從民國十四年沙基慘案發生時開始給世人注意以來，距今又十多年不受人提起了，最近因為蔣委員長從黃埔　艦到沙　云拜會英領，這塊地方，才重新喚起人們的回憶。</p>
<p>由於沙基慘案的發生，使一般人們對於沙面引起非常恐怖惡劣的印象，其實，假如我們摒除一切政治上的見解，專就它——沙面的本身說來，却可以得到一個相反的結論。</p>
<p>眞的，沙面這塊地方，是够動人的。它是沙基側旁的一個個沙洲，面積至多不過一二百畝，它和沙基長堤相距僅造咫尺之遙，中間隔着一條不很闊的河浜，在平時，這河浜裏佈滿着專給人們享樂的遊艇。</p>
<p>「遊河呀！」坐在岸上的船孃含着誘惑的目光在兜攬着如流水般的行人。</p>
<p>沙基和長堤完全是一條繁盛的巿街，不慣煩囂的人到這裏來散步也許會覺得氣悶，可是你如果踱過那橫跨在河浜上的精緻的石橋，到對面的沙面云，準定會得到另一種的感覺。</p>
<p>這裏有平坦如砥的柏油路，茸綠的草地散佈在馬路的兩旁，接近河浜的岸邊，勻整地植着幾十株巨榦的灌木，枝葉茂盛時，那亭亭的濃蔭，遮蔽到馬路上，陽光從枝葉的隙縫裏射下來，結成無數個小圓形，活像一幅美麗的圖案，偶而有一二陣微風拂過，樹葉簌簌地作響。對岸沙基和長堤的喧囂，給這種天籟掩蓋了，就在這麼十多丈的短短的距離中間，劃分了二個截然不同的天地。</p>
<p>馬路的兩旁，安置着不少的休息椅，疲乏時可以在這裏坐下來，在那綠陰深處，時時可以看見露出紅墻一角，這些有的是西人開設的銀行，有的是西人的住宅。</p>
<p>再走過去？便到另一邊的堤岸，前頭一片浩闊的河面，這便是民國以來很著盛名的白鵝潭。潭水很深，不少的外國商船和軍艦，都在當中停泊。</p>
<p>每到傍晚時分，可以看見一對對的情侶在網球塲上興盡歸來，互相挽着手臂，揮動着輕快的球拍，口裏哼着流行的情歌，合拍的步伐聲漸漸地隨着一雙倩影而消逝。</p>
<p>在這時，你也許另外感受到一種異國的情調了。</p>
<p>無論如何，沙面是美麗的，是够動人的。</p>

<h3 id="c200">特載日本棉布輸出减退（續十日報） <a href="#c200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— 汪警石</p>
<p>半年內向荷屬東印輸出者，為一六七，九六千碼，已减少二八，八八四千碼，卽百分之十四也，此為日本棉布之第二最大出路，其地處位僅次於英屬印度。但此種貿易之變化，係激烈之性質存在。乃由日荷交惡以來所造成有。至埃及者計四七，八六八千碼，較去年問期减退為二八，六一三千碼，或百分之三七·四。埃及政府在去年七月，曾公布與日本貿易條的，從九月二十日起，對日本貨品課以百分之四十之平衡稅，嗣後日埃於去年十月二十日在埃京開羅談判，對於平衡稅取消或改變，但其結果終於失敗，而埃及之棉布市塲，實為日本第四最大出路，其地位僅在東北四省之下。</p>
<p>向哥倫比亞輸出者，在本年間竟至斷絕，蓋日本與哥倫比亞間之商的，自去年四月卅日廢止後，此後對相互間之利益，卽各相限制，遂至貿易不通。他如伊蘭克自日本進口之棉布，去年為二三，八二千碼，亦减　三，五〇七千碼，或白分之三六·二，此則由於去年五月二十二日，該地頒布新律，此後凡由日本輸往之貨品，須課按値白分之十五之進口稅，因此對於　國貿易之前途，亦無過分之望。對古巴輸出者，共百分率竟减至百分九七，九，其數量　九，六三六千碼，不可為不鉅，　古已於去年三月間，亦曾宣布對日本棉布進口，課以百分之二十五之傾銷稅，人造絲為百分之　〇〇，最近由雙方談判，大致日貨進口之最低稅率，或可同意，惟日本應由古巴輸入其出口價値之半。</p>
<p>再以南美之阿根庭屬國而論、日本棉布半年間輸出數量為四五、三五三千碼、减白分之十六、較英國為不利、而該國之出口恊會、更規定對於進口貨、須課以百分之五之統制稅、以為輔助出口之用、至如輸往北美之海地亦减少百分之七十五、其最大原因、亦由稅率提高百分之一百所致、在廿年薩爾瓦多尚有九百萬碼棉布、由日本輸入、此後卽以有效之方法、以限止其輸入、故此後卽减至十七萬碼、此種方法、當歸功校嚴課百分之二百之進口稅、同時對常地輸出物、則减低百分之二十五、此為過去兩年之事實也、</p>
<p>再就澳洲方面論、過去半年間尚無若何更動、惟五月間新稅則規定棉布進口、須從價征百分之七零至一一零、是日本在澳洲又將失去極大銷路、故目前日本亦抵制澳洲羊毛以為報復、</p>
<p>至莫屬東印本年六個月輸出，共計二四九·五八九千碼、　往者　較尚無變更、　自去年十月至本三月止之第　貿易年期內、由日本出口及復出口尚超過七、四二零千碼、但前年之商的於三月間曾中斷、迨去年七月復繼續進行談判、當時英國極注意日本棉布之進展、結果由印度當局提高稅收百分之五、他如香港本為自由貿易港輸入無所限制、半年間進口共四零、三九九千碼、較去年問期驟增百分之六五·三、但其中一部分係復向他處出口者、由日本輸入東北者達一零六、八九五千碼、較同期增二一、九八二千碼、或百分之二五·九、同時關東租偕地亦增百分之四四、共中所增加者自屬輾轉運入我國中部無疑、</p>
<p>總上所述、日本棉布之輸出、大部均有退减之趨勢、惟歐洲尚有增加、但歐陸各國、各因其不同之性質而增加關稅、以資保護、日本則各別票訂特惠之待遇、故其結果、除德國外、前途似有增加之望焉、</p>

<p>— 原文載Archives　d'ophtalmologie,　Janvier　No.18俄國勞働醫科大學畢業楊道南醫師節譯</p>
<p>……婚前均宜及早治愈勿貽後悔　……難告隱病秘密自療法術精進</p>
<p>淋病的一個最普遍的現象，便是倂發精囊炎和攝護腺炎的遺精症。在急性的時候，尿道灼熱瘙癢，容易舉陽，所以遺精倂現的很多。到了慢性期，後尿道發炎，由攝護腺的腫脹，精囊的弛張，於是也有遺精症。往往濃汁淋漓，精濁不分，如果僅僅服以利尿或是消炎的淋藥，那根本無濟於事。年深日久，睾丸也發起炎來，精液頻洩，虧憊更甚，悲慘的結果，因之迫在眉睫了。即使抵抗力強，然而生殖的技能，已給毀損不堪，這一生就沒有結婚的機會。如果是結了婚的，不消說便永遠不會生育。</p>
<p>故淋病的弊害，不但關乎本身，並且影響到妻室兒女，為了這個緣由，要想結婚的青年患者，婚前應該迅速治愈。以求永久的幸福！</p>
<p>一九三四年全歐著名的淋病權威者德國淋病防治所所長Scherber　M.　D.博士及英國倫敦花柳病學校教授R.　M.　Mucha與美國Lenz　Hoffmann　M.　D.（性病學專家）等證實，患者處應注意攝養及飲食外，最要緊的，便是須用蛋白體治療，因為只有淋藥中的蛋白體才能夠彌補攝護腺睾丸精囊等部分因炎症而喪失之機能。所以博士切實推崇蛋白體黃色素合製劑「克淋儂」為最可靠。且絕無副作用。倫敦一地，去年一年中曾用「克淋儂」治愈十二萬〇〇七十一人，（白帶病女子佔三萬多人）至於淋病的遺精，則宜合用「耐而斯遺精片」，收效最確。</p>

<h3 id="c202">早洩腎萎為久婚不育者之癥結 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 法國Perseus博士原著　日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯譯</p>
<p>我們的生殖腺，平常都在十五六歲，即漸達於發育，如有性智識的，他對於這個時期有深刻而異常的注意。所以一切自瀆和早婚這兩件事。他們絕對是不犯的。但這等青年，可說僅有百分之一，而其餘的的九十九人，皆有自瀆的惡癖。手淫（即自瀆）之所以有如此可驚者，以其對生殖腺的機構，最容把牠弄壞，因而不能達執行生殖的任務了，牠的最著的症狀，就是局部及全身發育不全，早洩腎萎。這實在是久婚不孕最正確的病原。但是這病應當採如何的治療呢？那末，我們且把法蘭西的Saint　Laurence教授說的話來做久婚不育者的參考。他說每個青年人的手淫都難逃免的。但有多因覺悟得早或者先天稟賦甚厚，但這樣的人也很少。治療手淫或房事過度而來的久婚不育，我們可用德國梅倫氏發明的「補體康」為內服藥，以補給缺乏性發育不全，及早洩腎萎等要素的內分泌。因「補體康」是少壯期動物荷爾蒙所製成的。</p>
<p>俄國和德國備戰甚劇。所以他們努力鼓勵生育，於是「補體康」遂為兩國醫家所激賞，大事採用，結果人口與日俱增，尤其是石爾曼名族的增多，更有長足之進步。故「補體康」實為執各大國醫界之大　，余用此藥治愈久婚不育者，數亦在五六千人矣。（法國保族雜誌第七期。譯者按，余在日本帝國大學醫科畢業後，即在該校研究院內實地將「補體康」試騐。在百人中患早洩腎萎服「補體康」而獲效者，計九十四人，實為效率最高之荷爾蒙製劑也。）</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師</p>
<p>父母患淋·兒子失明。</p>
<p>患者陶錫暢君。年廿七歲，人頗風流自賞，喜狎邪遊。故所患淋病，荏苒多年。但平時如不受十二分刺戟，尿液瑩潔異常。惟會陰及下腹時有鈍痛之感。故亦不之注意。詎陶君夫人產一子，變目未幾失明。診斷結果，始知為淋毒性風眼者。因此前年二月間由葛平祥君介紹，始至余處治療，初行普通檢查，亦並無淋菌踪跡。嗣用特殊檢查法，取其受刺戟後所泌出之濁液，用顯微鏡檢查之下，有無數之淋菌，附緣於上皮細胞，（如第一圖），隨投以「克淋儂」使體內發生抗淋喰菌作用，先後復診四次，服至五星期，即告肅清，毫無淋菌。（如第二圖）雖行種種重大刺戟，仍無反應。此為「克淋儂」克服舊淋病之證明。其夫人之白帶，囑其外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」為坐藥，以滌淨白帶。仍已「克淋儂」為內服藥，以清淋解毒殺菌。至四星期即告全治。未幾其夫人仍占態罷，獲一麟兒，肥胖可愛。陶君夫婦，深為感謝，曾登報鳴謝，內中對於「克淋儂」一藥，尤揄揚備至云。</p>

<p>— 武鍾麟醫師</p>
<p>凡是吸煙的人，誰都有這樣一個疑問：就是自從中央頒布了五年計劃的戒煙運動，法令昭然，而何以吸者仍是徘徊觀望，不肯徹底解決癮毒？但是，他們也誰都有着親身經歷的答案：便是到現在，還沒有發明最有效的戒煙法的緣故！那些戒煙的藥物，多半有名無實，因了服用後在戒煙期中，仍不免種種痛苦，像失眠·腰　悲痛·盜汗·遺精·精神萎頓等症，在在使戒煙者繼續不起勇氣，所以怕於戒煙了。</p>
<p>自最新穎最進步的梅倫博士補體戒煙法在德國實行後，戒煙者從此可不必顧慮到種種痛苦了。只要進服梅氏「補體康」以「補」全「體」的細胞機能和蛋黃素，便可在短期內毫無痛苦的完全戒除煙毒·如最近胡嘉禾君，有六年煙癮，經用此法戒絕後，體重大增云。</p>

<p>睾丸炎腫之適應療法</p>
<p>淋毒性睾丸炎在淋毒病患中極為易見，但亦最易破滅性的機能。因之吾人對於淋毒性睾丸炎，實不可不早作徹底之治療也。何謂最易破滅性的機能。則因睾丸為製造精子，以為生殖之要素者。此種要素，必須絕對的健全及純潔。然後始合生殖之條件。但因淋病之關係，其淋菌毒由前尿道侵入攝護腺復由攝護腺而入輸精管，而達副睾丸，遂發生副睾丸炎。睾丸漸次腫脹，患者恒覺疼痛。劇者即續發精高系炎。自副睾丸炎，至鼠蹊部之輸精管，腫脹成索狀，疼痛逐日增加。製造精子之機能，恒在此等病狀之經過中而破壞，結果遂成絕孕。在精密之統計中，患副睾丸炎者百分之三十五·七無子。兩睾丸同時發炎者則幾占百分之九十五六無子云。</p>
<p>余年來以臨床上之實地統計，上述淋毒性絕孕，頗為正確。但在副睾丸炎時能及時治療者，則可保其恢復生殖力。有住麥根路之金子發君，年卅一歲。在廿六歲時患淋病。後轉睾丸炎。遷延未愈。痛楚不堪，小便頻數。睾丸偏　作痛。自患此病後，其妻從未有孕。且妻亦染着淋毒性白帶。懇余醫治。乃以長短波電氣交互治療。同時進服「克淋儂」，以抗淋喰菌，腿腫鎮痛。連服四星期，睾丸炎全愈。惟晨起時初次小便，尚略有溷濁，續服一星期而愈。其夫人白帶，亦用「克淋儂」為內服藥，外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥。旋亦治愈。最近欣獲一子。夫婦歡忭異常云。</p>
<p>肺癆常識</p>
<h3 id="c208">久咳成癆之原理 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 前南洋醫科大學教授滬南平民醫院院長鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>（診所）四川路甯波路口　（診時）下午四時至六時　　　肺癆嫌疑犯之福音　科學補救大收成效</p>
<p>先哲云：「防病于未然」，何如曲突徒新？故肺癆前驅症之咳嗽問題，最堪注意。</p>
<p>我們要曲突徒新，先就得明白久咳何以會成肺癆的原理。關於這點，瑞典的「肺病之預防」上面說得非常明白，今轉譯於下：</p>
<p>『咳嗽雖不一定是肺癆，可是咳嗽有引起肺癆的魔力，原來在傷風之後，肺臟受了打擊，器官發生炎症，而咳嗽便頻起不絕。由於咳嗽的連續震蕩肺部，肺的抵抗力處弱了，癆菌於是乎乘機侵蝕肺組織，這樣，就成功肺癆第一期的肺尖加答兒症。因此防止咳嗽，實際上正是防滅肺癆，患傷風及久咳的人尤應牢記着』。</p>
<p>以上是J．M．Rieger　M．D．（肺病專家）的論述，證明了中國『傷風不醒變成癆』那句話並不錯。近據調查，奧大利每週新聞記者B．L．Villemin氏增加訪紐約肺病療養院院長約瑟巴克維博士，據說在住院二千六百餘人中，有二千另四十人都是由傷風久咳而釀成肺癆的。根據英國Dr．Reichenbach博士的實騐，證明近世各國一直推崇具有偉力的肺癆特效藥「補肺拿爾」，因內含有Kresol膠油質，為肺癆第一期之前驅症（咳嗽多痰）最對症良藥。紐約肺病療養院不但以此藥治療乾咳，並施於重病的吐血潮熱胸痛盜汗等，效果更著。至於肺病人有神經衰弱的，那就該兼服男用「補體康」或女用「補女容」作有力的挽救了。</p>
<p>健美秘訣</p>
<h3 id="c209">乳房豐腴為獲得曲線美之先鋒 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 南通醫科大學畢業武鐘麟醫師</p>
<p>婦女的曲綫美，她最大的條件，就是乳房豐腴，臀部高聳，這才是人體美的標準。不但是人體美的標準，而且也是畢生幸福的很重要的要素了。因為乳房和臀部的發達，她的青春腺是健全的。換言之她有賢妻良母的資格了。我們時見青春腺不發育的女子，往往有月經參差不整，頭痛失眠，腰酸脚弱，玉容憔悴，乳　臀削，心悸健忘，發枯皺紋覆額，她的青春已完全消逝了。留下的僅有悲痛的心情，一切人生的幸福，她都沒有份了。</p>
<p>我們根據瑞士Rodriguez婦科博士的研究，說女子有前述的症狀，都由於排卵機能的底下，卵巢是青春腺的大動脈，假如這枝大動脈失調，那末全身的機能都不能正常發達了。惟一的治療，必須調整卵巢機能，而能担得起這重任的，那祗有「補女容」了。歐美各大著名的婦科醫院，都一致採用「補女容」為婦科聖藥。牠有調整卵巢機能，所以乳萎，臀削的病，遂獲全愈而達正常的發育了。一切神經衰弱和早老的症，也可治愈而恢復青春。但如有白帶病，那一方還須外用『卡氏陰道片』為坐藥。尤為標本兼治之方。</p>

<p>— 原文載Des．Perte　Seminales，1933，s留日陳敏伯醫師譯</p>
<p>發育被阻婚後焉能盡天職　陰萎早洩人生痛苦應消除</p>
<p>老實說：性慾原是一種本能，一個人到了相當的年齡，他自然需要一種發洩。然而性的感觸，是可用理智來克服的，所以我們可以這樣說：一個人如果結了婚，夫妻度着適當的甜密性生活，是應該的—因為這是本能的正常的生活，但，倘若是青年人，發育還不齊全，却天天想找刺激，居然施行手淫起來，那就是犯了變態的淫亂症，將來來不幸的厄運，真是無窮呢！</p>
<p>英國的大生理學家愛耳潑氏說：患強迫性手淫的，結果患不眠，勞動不能，性的精神衰弱的很多。性的衰弱是什麽呢。第一就是遺精，病勢激烈時，一星期有遺洩五次以上的。綺夢紛披，勾魂奪魄，輸精管鬆弛了，便會更進一步在白天發生精滑症。有時小便後，也有二三滴精液流出。一度患過本病，若沒有根本的治療，發育必受阻害，陽痿，早洩，子嗣艱難，都是必然的結果。據法人弗利尼博士及德國青年病學家赫加耳博士實騐，遺精只有服「耐而斯遺精片」最為安全有效。如同服「補體康」培補衰弱，那就可以兼助發育，遺精却好得更快了。</p>

<p>— 留俄楊道南醫師</p>
<p>欲求根本的治療　應循醫藥的正軌</p>
<p>胃病所以延成慢性，一則由于患者不自覺，以為無關重要。二則以前的醫藥家，墨守舊法，不肯作深切的研究，故迄無法對症的藥物發明。而患者遂日增多，其危機也就更大。</p>
<p>最近德國馬枯那孟博士，因鑒于患胃病者，胃痛胸灼，腸胃氣脹，或時而翻嘔，時而噯酸，於是對症配製「強胃精」治胃聖藥；因效果確實，莫不譽為二十世紀僅有之發明。</p>
<p>余在俄國時，曾用「強胃精」治愈很多重篤之胃痛與消化不良症，所以彼邦消化障碍的患者，如獲大赦，歡欣若狂？不過此藥還有一個特點，就是因內含為他藥所無之馬枯那孟氏營養鹽，故對於久病虛弱之胃呆，習慣性便秘，多屁症，及缺乏維他命B之脚氣，均具特效！</p>

<h3 id="c212">國慶後感 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 方克文</p>
<p>今年國慶日各地的情形，似乎比往年來得熱鬧，鼓舞歡忭，頗見普天同慶之象，以親眼見到的上海來說，那　形就和往年兩樣，往年因國難嚴重而停止慶祝的。今年則牌樓，宴會等等，又頓復舊觀了，雖然因為，嚴防反動份子乘機搗亂起見，提燈會之類依舊　有舉行，但是見了滿街掛着的都是「標準國旗」，那一種昇平氣象，也够使你好受的了。</p>
<p>但國座日方面雖是普遍的「懸旗誌慶」，而於嚴重的國難却似乎依舊遮掩不過去，「圖綏益急」的新聞且不說它，就所見到的上海來說吧，為避難而搬家的也在在皆是，滿街「帶着行李而走路」的人們，你瞧瞧他們陰沉的臉色，們所告訴你的便是倉皇和憂鬱，要從他們臉上看到國慶日的「太平世界一的反，那是不可能的。</p>
<p>有人或許會訕笑他們的胆小如鼠，庸人自擾，以致使愉快的國慶日不能表示愉快：這訕笑從某一個角度來看，自然是對之又對的，國為；任憑你怎樣的去避」，如果你不把敵人消滅了，它還是會跟蹤而來的，况且，要是一旦戰事不幸而爆發了，則在這次殖民地的中國，將不會有一片避難的桃源的。但市民們旣遭逢過一二八的敎訓，越界駐防又成為家常便飯，這呌驚弓之鳥的市民們，除了「避」之外，又那裏有更好的辦法？</p>
<p>由於「避難」，我們更是想起前幾天（怕就是是雙十節的報上？）報上刊過的一則年靑女郞蹈海自殺的新聞，那位年靑的小姐因為怕××人的蹂躪，更想到遲早總要一死，於是在「避難」之中，就慷慨向海裏一跳，算保留他的「淸白之身」。這位小姐的行為，自然是我們所反對的，而她致死的原因，除了國難」之外，背後還有對建餘孽在作巢，但因之，我們也可以看出，在國難嚴重中，人民在現實苦痛的煎熬下，是愉快不起來的，他們自然更沒有心緒去强作歡顏。所謂「挨了耳光再陪笑臉」。</p>
<p>也或許有人會說偉大的事業是要有愉快的情緒才能來完成的，像現在這樣的無事已惶惶不可終日的庸人自擾，那祗有自亂步伐：在目前的非常時期中，我們該非常沉着的來應付一切事變，原是對的，但這並不是說貪歡作樂，更不是粉飾太平，貪歡作樂粉飾太平的結果，那祗有比缺乏自信更糟，因為缺乏自信至少還見到目前嚴重的局面，而貪歡作樂和粉飾太平，則祗是想掩飾和躱避嚴重的局面。</p>

<p>「你問她幹嗎」？</p>
<p>「小氣幹嗎？還不是空鷄巴硬」？</p>
<p>還是昨天晚上，宿在東口井那家馬店裏。那店老闆的女兒長得怪標緻的，那雙脚是小得那麼地有樣，眼珠子烏溜溜的怪迷人的，還梳上一頭好髮髻呢。不知怎的給老李上了手，今早晨走的時侯，她問老李幾時再來？老李自己也沒有知道幾時再來這裏，於是那個小娘兒哭了，老李把她那塊濕透了的手帕要了來，算是個紀念呢！</p>
<p>那個滿頭是汗的賭氣的睡了，老李也沒趣地睡了。</p>

<p>— 牧野</p>
<p>淸早起，三麻子的茶館里老早的坐滿了人，每個人的臉上都是那麼緊綳綳的，顯得怪不得勁兒似的，又像是大夥兒都在給誰嘔氣，都悶在那兒，一動不動，一聲響不，大家都像是一段木頭，只有一對對的眼睛珠子，楞怔怔地互相溜幾下，別的便沒有什麼了。</p>
<p>平常，三麻子總是吱呀怪呌的，今朝他也改了常，像是第一天開茶館似的，一切都硬手硬脚的老別扭，他自己也莫明其妙為什麼一勺水會有一半要澆在壺外頭，他肚子里給別人一樣的懷着個鬼胎，他担心着有朝一日××的飛機眞的飛到了這鄉下來，說不定扔下個「一千磅」的大炸彈來專門炸他這個小茶館，都就糟蛋了！</p>
<p>「喂，賈掌櫃來了，那不是……」</p>
<p>靠東墻的窗下坐着的光頭悄聲的說了，看光景，他像是怕人聽見似的竭力的把聲音放低，可是大家已經都把視錢射到那振興米號的賈掌櫃身上了，大家又互相以目示意。三麻子向着光頭挑了挑下巴，癟了癟嘴。</p>
<p>就那樣的在衆目睽睽之下，賈掌櫃匆忙的步進來了，他一面用袖頭擦着汗，那隻手就在臉前比劃着，一開口就：</p>
<p>「糟了，糟了，…這可他媽的糟了……」</p>
<p>大家都預感到「糟了」是怎麼一回事，光頭差一點兒沒有哭出來，三麻子腿只打哆嗦，他預計着「一千磅」的大炸彈一定是脫不過了，他慢慢地走攏去，賈掌櫃正比手劃脚的講着：</p>
<p>「……這還有什麼話講呢，聽說不是今天，明天就要開火了，反正至多不出五天了！這一次不比那一次啦！……昨天我到城裏去，店舖都關了，街上連個鬼影子都沒有了……」</p>
<p>「是不是要給他幹一下子呢？」一個年靑人這樣的問了。</p>
<p>「這個咱家哪裏曉得呢？我看是……反正這事很難說呵！人家那兵隊天天來，海口上人家的兵船也擺滿了……」。</p>
<p>「飛機要扔炸彈——「一千磅」的嗎」？三麻子忍不住的問了。</p>
<p>「哼，一千磅！告訴你，那還是孫子輩上的呢！總而言之了吧！這次要比上次利害到百倍還不止哩！」</p>
<p>大家都呆住了，沉默里泛起了無數的歎息聲聲，大家都給賈掌櫃的話來懾服了。</p>
<p>「咳！別的先別管，弄點兒吃的是正經！打也吧，不打也吧，飯總是要吃的呵！費了九牛二虎的力氣，我才弄了五百石米來……」賈掌櫃又把聲音提高了向大家講着：「諸位要是預備下點吃的東西時要請早呵！」說着他便離開了這小茶館去了。</p>
<p>光頭第一個忙亂的跟了出去。</p>
<p>於是大家都把這個驚心的，不出五</p>

<p>天要開火的消息帶到了這鄉村的四面八方去。</p>
<p>第二天，三麻子實在無心再做生意了，天沒亮他便把那個懸得高高地淸心茶館的牌子摘下來。吃中飯的時候，他便趕到了振興米店去找賈掌櫃。</p>
<p>「喂，買掌櫃，咱也弄一包米，幹起來別撈不到東西吃……」</p>
<p>「是不是，說呌你們早來，這不是已經賣空了嗎？等着吧，我已經派人到城裏去接治買米的事了，憑天由命的等着吧！賈掌櫃指着米倉這麼說。聲音裏邊夾着笑。</p>
<p>五天很快的過去，已經是第七天的早晨了，大家像是出洞的耗子到處溜着探聽消息，三麻子第一個先碰見了賈掌櫃：</p>

<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>—山行雜記之六</p>
<p>在大龍山半月的山行，使我們最忘記不了的，是離開老馬夫家的那一天。我們因為感到路途短少，只須半天就可以到達山脚下。於是大家又要步行而不願騎馬了。而且我們的騎術都不大高明，說不定在下山坡的當兒，馬一失足，我們的繮繩拉不住，就有連人帶馬一起垂到山谷裏去的危險。</p>
<p>當我們離開老馬夫的家的時侯，天色是那樣地爽朗；血紅的太陽從東方的山嶺的背後，冲出來的時候，就用着它那强烈的光芒，緊緊地捉住了這條山路，彷彿要將一塊一塊的土地蒸出了油似的。從山峯上望下去，每一塊山石都給陽光反映得明亮刺眼，小路兩邊的山谷都烟　騰騰。因為是淸晨的原故，但不時地還可以從山峯上飄下來了絲絲的凉風。我們不感到絲毫的威脅，一面行着，一面就輕輕地唱着山歌。</p>
<p>不知不覺地；我們漸漸地行到半山腰中來了。陽光也漸漸地離開了我們，望着山脚下的一切漸漸地明朗化了起來，我們大家的心中都樂了。不知在什麼時候，天色突然地變了，烏雲滾滾，彷彿一隻魔鬼的巨大的黑手，就要伸過來緊緊地握碎了這山峯似的，我們意識到暴風雨，就要降臨了。於是我們加緊了我們的步伐，但山脚下又離得我們很遠，而兩旁的山谷更現得陰深空洞得可怕起來。山腰中除了我們四人之外，又無有一個生物，顫慄着的不止我們的心，就是路邊的樹呀！山石呀！也好像漸漸地被山峯上捲下來的風摧殘得而顫慄起來，瑟縮起來了。在這陰深的山腰中，它們大慨也和我們一樣恐怖的發抖的吧！全山腰是跌在恐怖的手握中了。</p>
<p>這時，我們就積極地想在路邊尋一個藏身的地方，但可憐連一塊大山石都沒有。我們又只好提起軟弱的步子向前行了。突然，在山腰的轉灣處，靠着一面山邊的地方，出現了一個茅草小屋了。看模樣那是一間賣茶的小店，屋門外搭着一個凉棚。一個二十歲模樣的婦人向一個打着兩根小辮子的六七歲的小女孩，站在路的中間，竚立着望着山脚下，彷彿在焦急地在等待一個歸來的人。</p>
<p>我們像發現新大陸似的那樣地愉快，急急地走上去。中年婦人聽着脚步響趕忙地回轉了身子，吃驚地望了我們一下，大槪看我們不是怎樣的壞人，就定了一定神問道：「先生；您家們是下山的吧？天色不好，馬上暴風雨魷要來了，您家們在這裏喝杯茶再去吧？」說着，他魷回轉了身子，又對山脚下望了一眼，一面就走到凉棚下來，為我們每個人泡了一壺茶。然後，她可走到路中間去望着山脚下。</p>
<p>剛坐下來，猛的暴風雨就降臨了。它們怒吼和哀號着，挾着威脅和恐嚇，山谷中轟轟地響，山谷中瀑布傾盆地瀉着，好像天地要角力了。凉棚以及凉棚中棹子給牠吹得呼呼地響，彷彿沉重的脚步踏過似的，我們都趕忙地躱到屋中來了。中年婦人牽着那六七歲的小女孩的手，站在門口，對我們哭訴道：「先生；這樣地大風大雨，常常地要將行路人捲到山谷中去的，這丫頭的爹」，她望望那個欲哭的女孩子一眼：「一大早，他就下山去賣柴去了，到現在還沒有回來，該不會要發生意外吧？說着，她便隱隱地啜泣起來了。</p>
<p>我們聽了她的話，大家都驚慌地面面相歔，我們將身體擠得更緊。</p>
<p>屋外風雨聲勢更加强了。我們心中都默默地祝那個行路人平安！</p>

<p>駱駝的背上，袋着一袋袋的煤塊，牠們一步步踱着，在頭頸裏的響鈴，擺動得響了起來。</p>
<p>駱駝惺松的眼睛，顯得格外的鬱結，在眼光裏，似乎有着幾十代在沙漠裏掙扎，遺傳下來的影子，牠們的駝峯上，厚厚披着的鬃毛裏，積朦了無數的風沙。牠們瘦瘦的腿上，有着被鞭撻的創痕，牠們彷彿忍住着許多的悲憤，蹈着沙土搖擺地走着。</p>
<p>一羣駱駝，遲頓地在高高古城旁踱着，牠們踏着地上的瓦礫，搖擺地走着。牠們似乎在沉想着，想着在往昔，在沙漠裏過着撤野的生活，想着被人束縛時，凶暴的被鞭打，想着駝起着許多笨重的東西，被人家索着鼻子跑……</p>
<p>一個漢子，拉着領頭一只駱駝的頭，一羣負重的駱駝，向着壯嚴的城門走去。</p>
<p>天色明亮起來，晨曦的陽光，在浮雲間透射出來，那溫暖的光，照着一羣駱駝，在地上隱隱斜橫着它們被拉長了的影子。</p>
<p>駱駝慣在陰暗裏的眼睛，被陽光射得有些眩昏，牠們竭力睜大着眼睛，望着在暮秋裏，那暖和明朗的光……。</p>
<p>牠們被陽光刺激得激動了，牠們全身消逝了的勇氣，又重湧上來，牠們的身子，感到暖溫起來，牠們高舉着脚步，激奮地走着。</p>
<p>牠們似乎想着，在沙漠裏，那激動的生活，那自由的日子，那同風沙撲鬥的情况……牠們彷彿被迷住了，一種渴望滋生着，牠們在渴望着那自由，那沙漢，那風！……。</p>
<p>駱駝在掙扎了。</p>
<p>駱駝猴面一樣的頭擺動着，牠們張開着唇皮欲咬起來，一陣熱氣冒出來，水沫在牠們嘴裏流出，牠們擺脫起背上笨重的負擔，在陽光裏，倔强地吼着……。</p>
<p>牠們勇敢地昻抬起頭，向着陽光裏奔去。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>素仰先生是熱心宣揚電影文化事業的。我想，現在我有一個要求，你先生一定會替我轉達的吧！</p>
<p>在不久之前，蘇聯駐華人大使曾柬邀上海各界參觀蘇聯軍事紀錄影片『為基也夫而戰，』那時我也曾去看過。先生。當我看見銀幕上的紅軍為了保衛祖國而作英勇的戰爭時，我的幾乎冰冷了的血立刻沸騰起來了。</p>
<p>『基也夫』是蘇聯接近西歐帝國主義的一個城市，它是各帝國主義進攻蘇聯的一個目標地。『為基也夫而戰』是蘇聯假想帝國主義進攻『基也夫』而紅軍奮起抗爭的影片，全片指示了一個國家在被侵略時唯一的路——祗有抗戰，因為祗有抗戰才能保衛領土。</p>
<p>中國在×帝國主義的眼光中到處是『基也夫』，中國的『基也夫』在他們威脅利誘下日斷送了不少。但還留着不少的『基也夫』，×帝國主義食而無厭的野心自然還得進攻的，我們為了自己的生存，國家的生存，我們怎樣使未失去的『基也夫』保留着，或者怎樣使已失去了的『基也夫』從×帝國主義手裏奪回呢？我認為，『為基也夫而戰』所指示我們的是再正確也沒有了。</p>
<p>中國已到了生存死亡的嚴重關頭，我們將發動一切足以抗×救亡的力量，文化界，文藝界，都已担負起非常的重任，電影這一宣傳的武器，我們自然不能不去利用它的。那麼，像這樣能够促起民衆一致起來的抗戰的『為基也夫而戰』，我們是有理由要求把它公映的。</p>
<p>希望先生把這信發表在報端。希望專映蘇聯電影上海大戲院能够設法在短時期內，映出『為基也夫而戰』，我想，有這樣期望的人，不會是我一個人吧！</p>
<p>祝安！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Britain Grants China Huge Loan: Millions of Pounds in Export Credit, Concerned About China's Future Revival, No Less Than a Sharp Warning to Japan <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(London) Today, sources from responsible circles revealed that China and Britain have reached an agreement in principle for Britain to provide China with export credit loans amounting to millions of British pounds. The agreement stipulates that China may purchase large quantities of British goods under the guarantee of the British government, in a manner similar to the £10 million credit loan granted by Britain to Soviet Russia in July this year. The authorities will issue a formal statement on this matter on Thursday. It is rumored that an important appointment regarding the agreement may also be announced within the week, but this has not yet been confirmed. It is widely rumored that Mr. Patrick, a Conservative Member of Parliament and former private secretary to Sir Samuel Hoare, will be appointed to this position. According to a diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph, the details of the agreement were established through negotiations between the Export Credits Guarantee Department (which negotiated the £10 million credit loan with Soviet Russia) and representatives of the Chinese government in London. This loan will greatly enhance Britain's prestige in China. This is the result of months of negotiations, largely due to the efforts of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, who recently returned from China. The correspondent also stated that this loan is no less than a sharp warning to Japan, indicating that although the British government previously held a pro-Japanese attitude, it is not indifferent to the future of the Republic of China. Once the agreement comes into effect, China will order a large quantity of goods from Britain, so Britain's export trade will soon be booming. The agreement may have far-reaching international consequences. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information received here, the British government has decided to appoint Mr. Patrick, a Conservative Member of Parliament, as a special envoy to Shanghai to promote British trade with China. Mr. Patrick will soon travel to China via Japan. It is reported that the British government is preparing to grant China export credit loans. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the British government has begun negotiations with representatives of the Chinese government to enable China to seek loans in the London market. This news was recently denied by official sources. Political figures said that financial circles in China and Britain are in negotiations, but have not yet consulted with their respective governments. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The State Department officially announced today that the United States has not been invited by any signatory nation of the Nine-Power Treaty to jointly protest against Japan's demands on China.

<p>(Nanjing) As of the evening of the 13th, the date for Kawagoe's fourth meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang has not yet been determined. According to Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the date for Kawagoe's meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang has not yet been determined. If time permits this week, a meeting may be held, otherwise it may be postponed until next week. The scope of the negotiations will not be known until after the meeting. It is also learned that the time for Kawagoe's visit to Zhang is awaiting new instructions from Tokyo. (Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3:00 PM today, Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, visited Consul-General Suma at the Japanese Embassy Residence to conduct the first preliminary negotiations, lasting two and a half hours. The content is unknown because neither China nor Japan has made any announcements. It is reported that the negotiations, which had already caused disturbances, do not seem to have produced any concrete results. Therefore, the official negotiations between Zhang Qun and Kawagoe cannot begin, and the preliminary negotiations will temporarily continue between Gao and Suma. (Domei dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of War Terauchi returned to Tokyo on the 12th after visiting the large-scale maneuvers in Hokkaido. A three-minister meeting was held on the morning of the 13th, and Foreign Minister Arita reported on the meeting between President Chiang and Ambassador Kawagoe, as well as other recent intelligence. As a result of the discussion, it was generally agreed that a fundamental principle of resolving the Sino-Japanese problem through diplomatic channels should be adopted, actively advancing to achieve progress. It is reported that the Japanese government is now expressing serious concern about the attitudes of Britain and the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sangshima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, who returned to Tokyo on the morning of the 13th, immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report in detail to Foreign Minister Arita. The government will hold a joint conference of the Foreign, Army, and Navy ministries in a day or two, based on the local situation brought back by Director Sangshima, to further negotiate. However, what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be most vigilant about at this time of Sino-Japanese negotiations is the intervention of foreign countries and irresponsible propaganda. At the same time, Japan must also work to eliminate it. It is said that the three-ministry joint conference to be held within the day under this policy will discuss countermeasures. (Domei dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the regular cabinet meeting on the 13th, the Foreign, Army, and Navy ministers remained at the Prime Minister's official residence. Prime Minister Hirota also attended and participated, holding a long-delayed four-minister meeting centered on the China issue. Regarding the border dispute between "Manchukuo" and Russia, the international situation in Europe and the United States, and other issues, each presented information and held various important discussions. In particular, regarding the Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations, Foreign Minister Arita explained in detail the talks between Chiang and Kawagoe, as well as the local report of Sangshima, Director of the East Asia Bureau, who had been dispatched to Nanjing and had already returned to Tokyo. He requested the understanding of the cabinet members of the Army and Navy departments and discussed future negotiation policies. As a result, a consensus was reached that Japan would move forward in accordance with the already decided fundamental policy of not moving forward. The meeting adjourned at half past midnight. (Domei dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 13th, newspapers in Nanjing and Shanghai published Tokyo dispatches stating that Foreign Minister Zhang and Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe would continue their fourth meeting on the 14th. According to diplomatic circles, Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe have not yet scheduled a meeting. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sangshima Kazue, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Tokyo on the morning of the 13th. He immediately gave a statement, saying that the general atmosphere in Beijing and Shanghai has gradually become more moderate. What is particularly noteworthy is that Sino-Japanese trade is more prosperous than before, and there is no sign of boycotting Japanese goods. The officers, including the Capital Garrison Commander, Gu Zhenglun, are doing their best to prevent terrorist activities. Almost every day, a police officer protects each overseas Chinese, which shows that they are extremely cautious. Japanese officials in China are neither optimistic nor pessimistic about the future of the negotiations. The declarations of Chinese newspapers are sufficient to reflect President Chiang's true intentions. Britain's concern about the Sino-Japanese negotiations can be seen from the speech of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, the editorials of The Times and the North China Daily News, and the fact that British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, paid a visit to President Chiang and met with Ambassador Kawagoe. The Soviet Union is now also quite active, secretly engaging in damage to the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. We must pay close attention to this. The National Government's opinions on specific issues must go through a lengthy period of time before they can be clearly understood. According to observations by the Central News Agency's special correspondent, the current negotiations have reached a complex stage. If both sides can show full sincerity and prevent terrorist activities, then a solution can be successfully obtained through diplomatic channels. In addition, foreigners should remain calm so as not to increase the difficulties. (Central News dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Sangshima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, submitted a report on the results of his visit to Nanjing to Foreign Minister Arita this morning. It is reported that the Navy, Army, and Foreign Affairs ministries will convene a meeting within the day, based on Sangshima's formal report, to determine Japan's future policy towards China. It has recently been widely rumored that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently seeking safe ways to avoid the possibility of any third party interfering in the formal Sino-Japanese negotiations, and intends to draw the attention of the Nanjing government to this plan. During today's cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Arita presented a formal report on the current situation in China and the entire diplomatic situation. After the cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Arita, Minister of War Terauchi, and Minister of the Navy Nagano held a meeting to exchange opinions on the Chinese situation, the recent accidents on the "Manchukuo" border, and the European situation. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The regular cabinet meeting, which had been postponed twice due to the ministers' trip to Hokkaido to accompany the inspection of the army's large-scale maneuvers, resumed at 10:00 AM this morning. Prime Minister Hirota, Foreign Minister Arita, Minister of War Terauchi, Minister of the Navy Nagano, Minister of Finance Baba, and other cabinet members all attended. First, Foreign Minister Arita reported on the results of Kawagoe's meeting with President Chiang and the general situation between China and Japan. Then, focusing on the China diplomacy issue, concrete countermeasures were discussed. The meeting lasted for more than an hour before it ended. Finally, Minister of Finance Baba reported on the budgets of various provinces, which can be reviewed and completed next month. The meeting then adjourned. After the meeting, Ministers Baba, Ogawa, and Maeda held a meeting to discuss the issue of nationalizing electricity. It is said that the bill may be finalized in the second half of this month. (China United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of War Terauchi returned to Tokyo yesterday. The conflict of opinions within the Japanese government regarding China policy will become more acute due to Terauchi's return to Tokyo. While the Minister of War was previously in Hokkaido, after repeated reports by Director of Military Affairs Bureau Isogai and Officer Umezu, he expressed firm support for the Navy Ministry's proposal. After meeting and discussing with the Navy Minister after arriving in Tokyo, his attitude will become even stronger. Foreign Minister Arita and Prime Minister Hirota and Minister of Finance Baba, etc., have repeatedly argued for a gradual approach due to international isolation and financial difficulties, but this view has apparently been "dismissed" by the military authorities who insist on the principle of national defense first. General observations are that although peace talks are currently underway, the possibility of them suppressing the military's warlike ambitions is very slim. (China United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The preliminary negotiations between Suma, Consul-General in Nanjing, and Gao Zongwu began at 3:00 PM today at the Consul's residence. The central issue of today's preliminary negotiations was the issue of the starting point for the resumption of negotiations between Kawagoe and Zhang. Both sides must have had considerable discussions on this point. However, it is doubtful whether Kawagoe and Zhang will begin formal negotiations within the day. Temporarily, it is feared that preliminary negotiations will continue. (Domei dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Sangshima, Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived at Tokyo Station at 8:00 AM on the 13th. Sangshima told reporters that he only acted as a telegraph agent and did not meet with any important people in China, so he could not explain what the current situation is in Sino-Japanese relations. You can understand everything by referring to the statement issued after the Chiang-Kawagoe talks. Sangshima also could not say whether Sino-Japanese relations had improved as a result of the Chiang-Kawagoe meeting. He had not heard what Chiang and Kawagoe would discuss at their second meeting.

<h3 id="e48">The Crisis in Suiyuan <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle in Sino-Japanese relations is undoubtedly all the "established facts" created by the Japanese military in North China. Now, the diplomatic authorities of the two countries are racking their brains to adjust their relations. The Japanese military seems to be intensifying the creation of new facts of aggression, deepening the rift between the two countries. This is something we cannot help but regret. According to Suiyuan telegrams, the Japanese military recently instigated the Chahar bandit Wang Ying's troops to invade Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan. Although this intrusion did not succeed due to the brave defense of Fu Zuoyi's troops, it shows that Japan is determined to occupy Suiyuan in the short term to complete the final stage of its plan to annex Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>Japan's ambition to annex Inner Mongolia has long been manifested in the division of Xing'an into four provinces. Since then, Japan has been monopolizing the feudal princes of Inner Mongolia and buying off bandits and traitors, trying to separate the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan from our country. Last year, Prince De, under Japanese coercion and exploitation, declared independence in Biximiao. The puppet army of Li Shouxin occupied six counties in northern Chahar and established a military government in Zhangbei, changing the county system to a league system. Thus, most of Inner Mongolia's territory has actually fallen. Now, even the surviving Suiyuan and southern Chahar are under the serious threat of Japan's military deployment.</p>
<p>However, even today, we cannot despair of the future of Inner Mongolia. We must know that the people of Inner Mongolia not only cannot be separated from the Chinese nation under international law, but also, due to their own awareness, they will also try their best to resist the oppression of aggressive forces. This can be proven by many past facts. Japan coerced Prince De to summon the various leagues and banners, which in turn led to the dissolution of the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and the rebellion of the Bailingmiao Training Corps. This is one. Four senior officials of the Xing'an puppet government, including Ling Sheng, were executed by the Japanese because the local Mongols opposed conscription and confiscation of pastures. This incident made the Mongols of various leagues and banners deeply feel the falsehood of Japan's "good neighborliness" propaganda. The establishment of the Suiyuan Mongolian Leagues and Banners Political Affairs Committee is said to have been prompted by this. This is two. This year, the puppet army of Li Shouxin, armed with modern weapons supplied by Japan, repeatedly invaded Taolin but was repelled by the Suiyuan Mongolian army. This is three.</p>
<p>The anti-Japanese sentiment of the Mongols has clearly caused many twists and turns in Japan's annexation policy. Japan's work to seize Suiyuan is therefore planned very skillfully and carefully. The recent guerrilla-style intrusions by small bandit troops are preparations for a large-scale invasion in the future. The activities of the Japanese army on the Ping-Sui Railway are arrangements to isolate the Suiyuan defense forces. And the military conference held by Prince De in Jiabusi earlier this month also has serious implications.</p>
<p>Today's situation increasingly confirms that Japan, in order to complete its annexation policy, is determined to acquire Suiyuan. Japan's goal in annexing Mongolia is, on the one hand, to surround Outer Mongolia to threaten the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, to lay the foundation for North China, and then extend its reach to the Central Plains of our country. Therefore, the survival of Suiyuan is of great importance to world peace and the future of China. For the sake of world peace and inviolable territorial sovereignty, we must do everything we can to preserve the endangered Suiyuan. We firmly believe that as long as the people of the whole country have a common determination, the ruined Inner Mongolia can still be saved.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Tripartite Currency Agreement of England, America, and France Takes Effect: The Establishment of a So-Called New Gold Standard Controls Exchange Rates and Eliminates Speculation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau declared today that the tripartite currency agreement is a new type of gold standard. Its main effect is to transfer the power to buy and sell gold from irresponsible speculators to the government. From the American point of view, the purpose of the agreement is to protect commerce from the impact of drastic exchange rate fluctuations without affecting the value of the dollar. The agreement took effect today. From now on, the sale of gold will be managed by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as the agent of the U.S. government, at a price of $35 per net ounce, plus a handling fee of 0.025%. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Ministry of Finance announced today that the technical cooperation arrangements agreed upon by the British and American financial authorities have been completed. As a result, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury will issue new regulations allowing any country that provides reciprocal convenience to purchase gold in the United States to exchange for U.S. dollars. The British government has allowed the U.S. authorities to enjoy this convenience in London. This daily operational approach will be of great benefit to the technical movement and control of exchange rates. Similar arrangements have now been agreed upon with the Bank of France, enabling effective cooperation between the three centers of London, Washington, and Paris. Reuters has learned that this approach is purely reciprocal and aims to facilitate technical movements without changing policies. The pound sterling remains a free currency and is not affected in any way. If there are surplus funds in New York due to exchange control intervention, they will be converted into gold at a fixed price. The same will be done when there are surplus funds in London and Paris, depending on the daily situation and at mutually agreed prices. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced today that the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will adopt a "new gold standard" starting on Tuesday, allowing mutual exchange of cash for banknotes. This measure can be cancelled at any time within 24 hours. The difference from the previous gold standard is that the new measure only allows governments to move cash and does not allow speculative profiteering. The Secretary also said, "We now welcome other countries to participate." The new measure also stipulates that the names of countries that can engage in cash transactions will be announced daily. Currently, the Federal Reserve sells cash at a price of US$35 per ounce, plus a handling fee of 0.025%. After the implementation of this new plan, foreign banknotes can be exchanged for cash, private speculation can be avoided, and exchange rates can be stabilized. The Secretary also said, "This is the second step in the government's implementation of world monetary policy, which has not been effective domestically," but its impact only affects the price of the dollar abroad and not domestically. If its implementation hinders the recovery of the United States, the United States can cancel it. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>The Basis for International Currency Stability</p>
<p>(New York) Commerce Newspaper editor Paul Boden declared today that the "new gold standard" of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States is convincing enough to make people believe that the world's leading countries are indeed planning to revive world trade by stabilizing currencies and reducing commercial barriers. There have been many questions recently about the value of the tripartite currency agreement. Now we have the government's answer. This agreement may become the basis for currency stability around the world in the future. Although it may not have significant immediate effects, its benefits will be seen over time, just as after the stabilization of the German mark in 1924, world commerce flourished until it was interrupted in 1929. The new tripartite agreement may also have the same effect. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

<p>(New York) Regarding the mutual freedom of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States to purchase gold, financial experts on Wall Street have recently commented that the United States originally prohibited the transport of gold to the United Kingdom and France. Now that the exchange equalization funds of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France can purchase gold from each other to prevent huge fluctuations in the exchange market, the above ban has been virtually lifted. When the authorities of these countries established the currency agreement, they must have already discussed it, but they waited for the financial legislation of the countries concerned to be harmonized with this new approach before announcing it today. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) British officials are unwilling to comment on the "new gold standard" agreed upon by the United Kingdom, France, and the United States. Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain only said that "the pound sterling is already free" and solemnly declared that the agreement is "purely technical and does not change policy." Local newspapers today all carried similar arguments, and between the lines, it can be seen that the United States has completely or partially lifted the ban on cash exports.

<p>There is No Need to Devalue the Japanese Yen Again</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the establishment of a free gold movement agreement between the exchange equalization funds of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, the Ministry of Finance authorities observed as follows: the tripartite exchange stabilization agreement that occurred as a result of the devaluation of the French franc is expected to be followed by some kind of stabilization work. The Secretary of the Treasury's statement can be regarded as the first step in realizing this work. The result is to stabilize the exchange rates between the three countries without transporting cash. Only by transferring the amount to the counterparty country can the fluctuation of exchange rates be prevented. In the past, the United States allowed gold to be transported to gold standard France. The result of this time recognizing it for the United Kingdom as well is that the exchange rates between the three countries can temporarily find a stable point. Also, when the tripartite agreement was established, Japan was asked for understanding and hoped for support. Japan has expressed its approval, because there is no intention to depreciate the value of the Japanese yen again.

According to Catholic leaders preparing for the Congress, an estimated 5,000 to 10,000 Catholics from all over the world will gather in Manila by sea and air. At least 300,000 of the Philippines' 11.5 million Catholics will also attend the meeting. Radio broadcasting has already been tested today. At that time, Pope Pius XI's blessing will also be broadcast by radio from the Vatican to the Congress venue. In the United States, the entire country will be rebroadcast by radio networks.

<p>Moscow Correspondence - Soviet hero Vasily Molokov has arrived in Moscow, completing his great flight, passing through all the important locations in the Soviet Arctic region. Under extremely difficult climatic conditions, Molokov flew over 26,000 kilometers, from Krasnoyarsk via Ayan (Okhotsk Sea Port), Petropavlovsk (in Kamchatka), Commander Islands, Bering Strait, Wrangel Island, Cape Schmidt, Tiksi Bay, Cape North, Dickson Island, Vaigach Island, Arkhangelsk to Moscow. Thus, Molokov has for the first time completed a miracle of flying the entire Great Northern Air Route, proving that regular east-west exchanges can soon be carried out along the entire Arctic coast.</p>
<p>The aircraft Molokov was on was: USSRN2, a twin-engine all-metal flying boat, motor "M17" type, equipped with the latest aviation instruments, with a lifeboat, a rubber boat for five people, and a complete set of utensils for the crew.</p>
<p>In addition to Molokov and his assistant pilot Bobby and Mov, co-pilot Mishchenko, navigator Ritzren, the plane also carried the Deputy Director of the Northern Sea Route Administration, Bugarvinov, two officials from the shipping line, and a special reporter from the Truth Daily.

<p>(London) A partial reorganization of the British Cabinet may take place in the near future, and is currently being discussed by politicians. The reason for the cabinet reshuffle is that the Secretary of State for Scotland, Collins, is recuperating in a Zurich hospital in Switzerland due to illness and cannot return to his post for a while. A replacement must be found. However, Collins belongs to the National Liberal Party. The National Cabinet is organized jointly by the Conservative Party, the National Liberal Party, the National Labour Party. Now, if Collins leaves his post, the original distribution of cabinet seats among the three parties will lose its balance. Some politicians are now planning a remedy, that is, to promote the Minister of Transport, Sir Ballysher, to the rank of cabinet member, either to continue to serve as Minister of Transport, or to change his position to Secretary of State for Scotland. After all, it is not easy to find another National Liberal Party member to take on the post of Secretary of State for Scotland, and Sir Ballysher was originally a member of the National Liberal Party. Therefore, some people advocate grafting to maintain the original balance of the various parties in the cabinet. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>Cleveland, USA - Republican presidential candidate Landon gave a speech here today, vigorously attacking the waste of the New Deal, saying that the current government, in times of serious depression, still has the energy to edit guide books and analyze geological fossils. Although Landon did not criticize the New Deal's disaster relief funds, he claimed that the government used the funds to create a huge political organization to preserve its regime and to make one-sixth of the nation's population live in another economic world, controlled by a hopeless federal bureaucracy. In fact, the solution to the disaster relief problem lies entirely in recovery, and the way to recovery lies in the government stopping controlling people's lives. If I am elected, the Republican Party will first collect the facts of the unemployment problem, and then the local authorities will handle the disaster relief, with the federal government only providing economic assistance. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Denver, USA - Republican presidential candidate Landon severely criticized President Roosevelt's New Deal, accusing him of wasting national funds. Today, President Roosevelt gave a campaign speech here, responding, saying that when he took office, the nation's economic activity was completely stagnant, and he had to take strong action. "The government allocated funds to enable unemployed workers to obtain work, and provided loans to people in various industries. It is true, but the government's actions were based on the opinions provided by technicians and specialized institutions in various regions of the country, especially in the agricultural and mining centers, not reckless. Later, the industries were revived thanks to the government's efforts." President Roosevelt then said that the government now has sufficient gold reserves to redeem all circulating banknotes. "The stability of our country's currency system is unparalleled in the world." Finally, the President reiterated the declaration he made ten days ago in Pittsburgh, saying that the government will save expenses and increase revenue, and the budget can be balanced and the national debt can be reduced in one or two years. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Denver - President Roosevelt gave a speech to the crowd here today, emphasizing the progress of the U.S. economy, believing that the government budget can be balanced in one or two years, and saying that if elected for the job again, he will continue agricultural policies and relief plans. The President's speech did not mention Republican presidential candidate Landon, but this was a response to Landon's speech in Chicago, saying that Republican leaders called our great plan a waste, which is ridiculous, because their states and local governments had financial panic and first asked the federal government for relief.

<p>(London) The German Chargé d'Affaires in Britain, Bismarck, submitted a note to the British Foreign Office today, expressing opposition to the Anglo-Russian naval treaty draft because it deviates from the principles of the 1936 Anglo-French-American naval treaty, believing that the British side has made excessive concessions to Russia in the Anglo-Russian draft treaty. The most important of these is the provision that if Japan violates the qualitative restrictions of the tripartite naval treaty, the Soviet Union can also use it as an example. Although the German note did not mention revising the Anglo-German naval treaty, foreign naval circles fear that Germany's move may be a sign that if Britain's concessions to Russia are not changed, Germany will also propose a revision request. Since the Anglo-Russian naval restriction treaty cannot be signed without Germany's approval, the Soviet Union has stated that Germany should also accept any qualitative restrictions. If Germany and Russia cannot compromise on qualitative restrictions, then Britain's efforts to promote the principles of the tripartite naval treaty to the Baltic Sea and Scandinavian countries will be in vain. Even the tripartite naval treaty itself will lose its effectiveness due to the escalator clause. The only hope is that all parties can reach a satisfactory solution. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The German government today delivered a new note to Britain, stating that if the Anglo-Russian naval agreement is signed, the German government will have to consider expanding its navy. The German government believes that the Anglo-Russian agreement will overturn the naval balance of power in Europe, especially will disrupt the balance of power in the Baltic Sea, so it requires a revision of the Anglo-German naval treaty signed in London in June 1935 to remedy this.

<p>(Washington) Most observers here believe that Britain's proposal to maintain the status quo of Pacific fortifications may promote a general naval disarmament understanding between Britain, the United States, and Japan. Some semi-official circles here initially opposed the British proposal because it would make the United States give up the cheapest and safest way to deal with Japan's expansion of its navy, but it was learned today that the United States may consider this proposal if Japan can reliably guarantee not to expand its navy. According to non-official sources, if Japan is willing to announce its three-year, five-year, or ten-year naval construction plan in advance, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan may be able to reach a tacit understanding on fleet strength. This tacit understanding will be a gentleman's agreement between the three countries on naval and Pacific defenses, without mentioning a ratio system, so as to avoid Japan's dislike and achieve the effect of avoiding naval competition. The mutually beneficial points in the London and Washington treaties should be retained. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>

Regarding this matter, naval circles also said that the British government also intends to invite countries other than the signatories of the 1930 and 1936 two naval treaties (i.e., the United Kingdom, Japan, the United States, and France), especially Germany, Russia, and the Scandinavian countries, to sign and participate together.

<p>(London) After Britain and Russia recently reached a naval agreement in principle, the German government lodged a protest with the British Foreign Office yesterday. German and Russian sources here believe that Germany's actions are due to a secret agreement between Japan and Germany. The Anglo-Russian naval agreement contains a clause stipulating that if Japan violates the restrictions in the Anglo-French-American naval agreement in the future, the Soviet Union in the Pacific will not be bound. However, the German protest was made to Britain, and it will naturally be answered by Britain, so it has nothing to do with the Soviet Union. Therefore, the Soviet Union has no intention of changing the Anglo-Russian naval agreement. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Japan's Attention <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Navy is paying close attention because the Anglo-Russian naval agreement is about to be concluded and the Soviet Union will expand its unlimited military preparations in the Far East. According to a London dispatch on the 12th, Germany sent an important note to the British government regarding the agreement. The Navy's general view on this is as follows: Germany has a superior navy in the Baltic Sea. If the Soviet Union is allowed to maintain a new naval force there according to the Anglo-Russian agreement, Germany will inevitably feel a major threat. Once the agreement is concluded, if the German navy is 35% of the Central Navy according to the Anglo-German naval agreement, it will obviously be difficult to maintain superiority over the Soviet navy. Therefore, Germany has asked Britain to reconsider the Anglo-Russian agreement, and when the Anglo-Russian agreement is concluded, it will also demand that the Anglo-German agreement be made public, which must be said to be a matter of course.

<p>(Moscow) At 7:00 AM (Boli time) on the 11th of this month, 35 armed Japanese soldiers crossed the border at a place 3.5 kilometers south of Bashikeri Village in the southernmost border of the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo."

The Foreign Affairs authorities are currently awaiting clarification of the local situation before transferring it to diplomatic negotiations.

Cudahy also strongly urged the people to re-elect President Roosevelt to guarantee the peace of the United States. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e75">Japan Develops North China's Economy: Mining Issues Settled in Two Steps; Li Szu-hao's Whereabouts Are Secret <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence. The current focus of Sino-Japanese issues in North China is economic development, which includes mining, cotton planting, and the establishment of a transportation network. Currently, concrete negotiations have not been made on cotton planting and transportation. The mining issue has been decided. The first step is for the Hopei-Chahar Political Council to issue an order on the 12th to the Lungyen Iron Mine Company to expedite the settlement of matters. The council will order the Construction Committee to take the mine under state ownership. The second step is to conduct detailed exploration and planning. The Construction Committee is currently drafting a plan. It is likely that the mine will be jointly operated by Chinese and Japanese investment. The headquarters of the mine company will be located in Shihchingshan, west of Peiping. It has been closed for ten years, and the chimneys have rusted. The funds for repairs will be substantial. Funds are reportedly being raised. The mining area is located between Hsuanhua and Lungkuan in Chahar province. Since the establishment of the company, it has not been mined. It is decided that mining will resume immediately after the company takes over. Cotton planting and railway construction issues will be negotiated after the mining project is completed. Regarding the navigation issue, discussions were held once before, and opinions are being exchanged based on the original plan. However, because the views of both sides are still far apart, no concrete conclusions have been reached. In the past ten days, no further discussions have been held on this issue. As for the Hopei-Chahar Political Council, according to Japanese newspapers, a Standing Committee will be established with five members. This statement is indeed true. A few days ago, Sung Che-yuan invited key figures in Peiping, such as Chin Teh-chun, Chang Tzu-chung, and Liu Ju-ming, to exchange views several times at his private residence in the Wu-i-ku. He also visited Hsiao Chen-ying to discuss everything frankly. However, the selection of personnel to the Standing Committee requires considerable consideration. It is also difficult to predict whether the establishment of the Standing Committee will be more effective than the current one. If there is no such guarantee, then there is no need to establish it. It is now known that this issue has been temporarily shelved. As for Li Szu-hao's arrival in Peiping, there will be negotiations on the economic front. He has met with Sung several times. There is also a rumor that Li will succeed him as chairman of the Economic Committee. Li is currently staying at the Beijing Hotel and is refusing to see visitors. His whereabouts are very secretive.

<h3 id="e76">Overview of Kwantung Leased Territory under Japanese Rule: Managed for Thirty Years as a Base for Aggression against Manchuria and Mongolia <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Dairen Correspondence. The reason why the Japanese seized the Northeast is that they regard the South Manchuria Railway as their lifeline and the Kwantung Leased Territory as their base. Since the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, the Kwantung Leased Territory has completely fallen under Japanese rule. All Japanese plans and aggressions against Manchuria and Mongolia are launched from the Kwantung Leased Territory. The September 18th Incident is one example. Now that the Northeast has been lost for five years, the Japanese have ruled the Kwantung Leased Territory for thirty years. The current situation in the territory is completely Japanized. The population, industry, and other conditions in the territory are recorded below for the information of the people of the country.</p>
<p>Population</p>
<p>The population of the Kwantung Leased Territory, according to a survey conducted by the Japanese last year (Japanese Showa 10th year), was 1,134,074. Of these, 163,796 were Japanese, 4,389 were Koreans, 963,875 were Chinese, and 204 were foreigners. Compared with the survey thirty years ago (Japanese Meiji 38th year), the population was 374,785, of which 5,035 were Japanese, 369,726 were Chinese, and 34 were foreigners. Under this comparison, the total population has almost tripled, and the Japanese population has increased by more than 34 times. The Chinese population has only increased by more than two times.</p>
<p>Agriculture and Animal Husbandry</p>
<p>The main agricultural products since Japanese rule are peanuts and fruit trees. The area planted with peanuts is more than 34,000 chōbu, with a harvest of 4 million yuan. Most of it is exported. The area planted with fruit trees is more than 5,100 chōbu, with a harvest of 5.6 million kan, valued at 2.8 million yuan. The main fruit is apples. The harvest of young trees now growing is expected to be four times as much. As for cultivating cotton, it is an important industry in the Japanese national policy. After years of research by the Kwantung Agricultural Experiment Station, the early-maturing variety of upland cotton, "Kwanno No. 1," which is suitable for cultivation in the Kwantung Leased Territory and southern Manchuria, has been improved and is about to be completed. This variety will be popularized in the territory and southern Manchuria. Today, the domestic poultry in the territory is heavily promoted and praised by the Japanese, who believe that it has become a superior breed. The improvement of pigs, cattle, and horses is particularly noticeable.</p>
<p>Salt Industry</p>
<p>The salt industry in the Kwantung Leased Territory is also the most distinctive and important industry. The climatic conditions of the Kwantung Leased Territory are suitable for sun-dried salt, and it can be manufactured anywhere along the coast. It has been a salt-producing area since ancient times. Later, at the beginning of Japanese rule, the scale was not large. There were 1,200 chōbu of Chinese salt fields. According to the Japanese, it has now reached more than 8,650 chōbu (90% of which are operated by the Japanese). As for the amount of salt produced, last year (Japanese Showa 10th year) the harvest reached 840 million catties, which is a production of 470,000 tons.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce</p>
<p>Among the industries in the Kwantung Leased Territory, the ones with medium output are yarn, hemp bags, cement, glass, soybean oil, and lumber. According to the statistics of factories at the end of Showa 8th year (Japanese), (those employing more than five workers) there were 557 factories, with a total capital of more than 72 million yuan, and an annual output value of 69 million yuan.</p>
<p>Fishery</p>
<p>The Kwantung Leased Territory is surrounded by the sea on three sides, and the coastline is more than 700 miles long. There are more than 40 islands of various sizes, and the coast is rich in bays, making it convenient for boats. Fish production is abundant. According to its history, in September of the Japanese Meiji 38th year, as a result of the Russo-Japanese War, the Kwantung Leased Territory became a forced leasehold of the Japanese Empire. Therefore, many Japanese people moved into the Russian properties, so the demand for fish increased sharply. At that time, there were no fewer than 1,300 Japanese people who supplied fish for this purpose throughout the year. According to Japanese officials, the number of Japanese people accustomed to fishing has increased. Since 1925 (Japanese Taisho 14th year), when Japanese domestic motorized vessels aiming at the sea bream industry began large-scale bottom trawling in the Bohai and Longkou Straits, Japanese fishing now accounts for 80% based on this fishing method. Now, looking at the comparison of aquatic products between Meiji 39th year and Showa 8th year since the lease of the Kwantung Leased Territory, we can see its progress. (Fishery catch is in kan)</p>
<p>Japanese Meiji 39th year 375,538</p>
<p>Japanese Showa 8th year 13,520,000</p>
<p>Japanese fishermen use Dairen and Lushun as bases, and the islands near the sea, which are 700 miles from each other, are generally used as fishing grounds. Haiyang Island, famous for the Sino-Japanese War, is located at the eastern end of the Changshan Islands and has a natural harbor. It is now the base for fishermen. The important aquatic species are sea bream, cod, hairtail, flatfish, sea bass, mullet, mackerel, eel, conger eel, sea bass, and dozens of other species. In addition, the guidance of the Kwantung Leased Territory for the aquatic products industry is also very complete.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Anhui Highway Construction Status: Over 5,000 Kilometers of Highways Have Been Completed and Opened to Traffic; Railways Connect Chekiang-Kiangsi, Peiping-Hankow, Peiping-Canton, and Peiping-Pukow <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence. In addition to the trunk and branch roads determined by the Three Provinces Highway Conference and the Seven Provinces Highway Conference, and the provincial, county, and township connecting routes set by the province itself, Anhui province is also actively expanding trunk roads. At present, the province has 1,300 kilometers of paved highways and 4,000 kilometers of dirt roads open to traffic. In southern Anhui, there are the Wuhu-Tunxi, Hsuancheng-Changxing, Hangzhou-Huizhou, Sheng-Ying, Gu-Tunxi, Ching-Chien, Chun-Tunxi, and Tunxi-Chingde highways. Except for Nanling, Chingte, Tungling, and Fanchang counties, all other counties have direct or indirect connections with the trunk roads. The province is now supervising the above five counties to expedite the construction of county roads to facilitate connections. The important trunk roads in central Anhui include the Anqing-Hofei, Hofei-Liuan, Hofei-Chaoxian, Shu-Liuan, Kao-Chien, and Chien-Tai highways. Limited by financial resources, there are many dirt roads open to traffic in northern Anhui, which can directly reach Jiangsu and Henan provinces. Plans are underway to add paved surfaces and repair related routes to facilitate widespread connections. In addition, a section of the important Kueisui trunk road in northern Anhui is being paved and prepared for opening to traffic. In the future, from Hao County in northern Anhui, via the Kueisui road to Fuyang, then to Liuan, connecting with Liuhe, An-Hofei, Sheng-Tunxi, and Tun-Chi highways, it will be possible to reach Chi-men in southern Anhui and reach the Kiangsi province, completing a major trunk road running through the entire province from north to south. The important routes belonging to western Anhui include the Liu-Yeh, Liu-Huo, Huo-Yeh, Huo-Chu, Ta-Ma, and Ma-Liu highways, which can be used to reach Henan province directly. As for the Ching-Wu highway in eastern Anhui, because it has been open to traffic for several years, the ones currently being expedited include the Chu-Liu, Yu-Chiang, Ming-Chiang, Chuan-Pu, Tan-Lai, and Ho-Wu highways. After some time, the entire project will be completed. The railways in Anhui province are divided into three types: state-owned, provincial, and commercially operated. In the past, the only state-owned railway passing through the province was the Peiping-Pukow Railway, which facilitated foreign trade and transportation in Pengpu and Fengyang in northern Anhui. The provincial and commercially operated railways have only started in the past two or three years. For example, the Chiangnan Railway Company, which is commercially operated, completed the Ching-Sun section (170 kilometers long) last year. After it opened to traffic, inland transportation in Anhui province could directly reach Nanking and connect with the Peiping-Shanghai-Hangchow-Ningpo, and Peiping-Pukow, Lunghai, Peiping-Hankow, and Chiaochow-Tsinan Railways. Therefore, this year, the Ministry of Railways started to connect the Ching-Sun section of Chiangnan from Hsuancheng Sunchiapu, and built the Ching-Chi Railway, running through the counties of southern Anhui to Kweiki in Kiangsi, and connecting with the Chekiang-Kiangsi Railway and the Canton-Hankow Railway. There are now tens of thousands of workers starting construction from the provinces of Anhui and Kiangsi, and the survey work in Anhui has progressed from Hsuancheng beyond Ningkuo County towards the Hui district, reaching Chingtechen in Kiangsi. The total length of the entire route is 500 kilometers. The general engineering bureau is located in Hsuancheng. According to the director, Cheng Hua-yun, the entire route can be completed and opened to traffic by the end of next year. Also, the Huainan Railway of the state-owned Huainan Coal Mine Bureau, which is 220 kilometers long, has been completed and opened to traffic. It passes from the Tienchiuan mining area in Huaiyuan, western Anhui, through Hofei, Chaoxian, and Hanshan to Yuchiukou across the river from Wuhu. All sectors in the town of Changchiang utilized it, because the town originally belonged to an important town in western Anhui. The railroad transportation is crucial to the prosperity of rural commerce. The town is only ten kilometers away from Tienchiuan, so it has submitted a request to the Huainan Mining Bureau to extend it slightly and reach the town directly. However, the state-owned railway has its own fixed plan, which is not easy to change. Therefore, it was decided that the railway bureau would assist in the surveying and planning, and the merchants and residents of the town would raise funds and build it themselves. As for the ones that Anhui province plans to build, there is the section from Hofei to Yehchiachi of the Hsinyang-Pukow Railway. The road extends westward through Hsinyang in Henan and connects with the Peiping-Hankow Railway. Extending it southward from Hofei can reach Luochuan Town in Huaiyuan, Anhui, so that it can connect with the Huainan Railway. If it can be extended by another hundred miles, it can be connected to the Peiping-Pukow and Peiping-Hankow Railways and directly reach the capital. However, the construction cost is very large. There was a proposal for the central government to provide 8 million yuan and the provinces of Anhui and Henan to each raise 4 million yuan, so Anhui province is currently negotiating with the central government and the Henan provincial authorities to plan to start work as soon as possible.

<p>Levy of the First Phase of Land Tax</p>
<p>This year, the rice fields in various townships of Wuhsien County have had a very good harvest due to the even distribution of rainfall. Although the issue of the quality of rent grains has been investigated by officials sent by the Finance Department to Soochow, it has not yet been determined. The actual collection is roughly 92.3%. The Finance Department is currently being consulted, and the merchants are also carefully deliberating to facilitate the opening of warehouses for rent collection. As for the collection of the first phase of the 40% land tax by the county government, all the registers have been completed and will be distributed as tax payment receipts. The collection of the first phase of the land tax is scheduled to begin on the 16th.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Air Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>The Wuhsien County Air Defense Sub-district Headquarters, which was initiated and organized by the Wuhsien County Government and other agencies, has been prepared and will hold an inauguration meeting at the county government at 9:00 a.m. on the 13th. The commander will be the county magistrate, Teng. In addition, the Wuhsien County Air Defense Branch will convene representatives from all walks of life on the morning of the 14th to discuss effective methods of air defense propaganda. As for the Air Defense Exhibition, there is no date for it to be held.</p>

<p>Robbery at Lung-hsing Yehchia-wei</p>
<p>At about 11:00 p.m. on the 12th, the home of Yeh Chin-liang, a farmer in the 7th bao, 5th chia, and 4th household of Lung-hsing Village, District 1, was visited by seven or eight bandits speaking a northern Kiangsu dialect. Each held pistols, sharp knives, ropes, candles, etc. They broke the back door and entered, tying up all the men and women in the Yeh family. Only Chin-liang hid behind the back door and was not tied up. He went out the back door to call for help, but was quickly shot twice by the bandit guarding the door, hitting his right leg. One bullet went through, and one did not, causing him to bleed and fall to the ground. The bandits whistled and fled east. After the victim inspected the losses, it was found that Yeh's mother, Shen, was robbed of 20 yuan, and his sister-in-law, Wang, was robbed of 50 yuan. Before leaving, the bandits carelessly dropped a sharp knife, a hemp rope, and two pairs of shoes. The victim reported the incident to the Second Police Station on the morning of the 13th to pursue the bandits. It was heard that when the bandits fled, they robbed Yeh's small ferry boat. It was not discovered until dawn in the Kuantang River, about half a mile away.</p>

<p>Red Cross Branch Organizes Malaria Eradication Team</p>
<p>This autumn, malaria has been found to be very serious in the eastern townships of this county, with successive deaths. Some people even die within three to five days, and it is spreading very rapidly and is everywhere. According to the statistics report of the district office, on average, one person in every two households suffers from this disease, which is a serious situation. However, the villagers are misled by superstition, do not seek fundamental treatment, and turn to the superstition of ghosts and gods, so the situation is not alleviated. The local Red Cross branch, seeing the rampant malaria in the township, plans to organize a malaria eradication team. It will depart soon with doctors from the local Western Medical Association to various areas, either to provide injections or to donate quinine pills, so that the malaria germs can be eradicated as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The Rural Sentinel Station in Taixing (Part 2)  Qi Feng</p>
<p>What I personally experienced in my hometown during my summer vacation was like this. According to my family members, in addition to unclear and inexplicable extortion from the villagers, they openly established many forms of exploitation, leaving the common people in a state of mixed emotions. For example, birthday fundraising is a very obvious example. I heard that there are countless people in my hometown celebrating birthdays every year. The township head wants to celebrate his birthday, the bao head wants to celebrate his birthday, and the guo dong wants to celebrate his birthday. Among them, the "Bureau Chief" seems to celebrate birthdays the most diligently and profitably. The "Bureau Chief" celebrates birthdays at least three or four times a year. After celebrating his own birthday, he celebrates his son's birthday. After his son's birthday, he celebrates the death anniversary of his mother, who died twenty years ago. When the "Bureau Chief" celebrates a birthday, he does not wait for people to voluntarily come to congratulate him. Instead, the baojia leaders are required to distribute congratulatory gifts from village to village. Each birthday celebration brings in at least five or six hundred yuan! In addition to celebrating birthdays to raise money, there is also the firearms donation, and after the firearms donation, there is the winter defense donation. The winter defense donation happens every year, costing five hundred yuan each time. How can the poor farmers afford such exorbitant taxes?</p>
<p>As soon as the summer vacation ended, I went to another village. Regarding the various virtuous policies of the sentinel station, I didn't know as many details as when I was at home, except for occasionally seeing one or two records in the newspaper. Recently, a letter from home said that our "Bureau Chief" had committed treason and was arrested by the county government and taken to Zhenjiang. It also said that on the day the "Bureau Chief" was arrested and taken to the city, the "Bureau Chief's" followers caused a great disturbance. They were deeply afraid that the "Bureau Chief" would never return, so they threatened many villagers in various villages to put down their hoes and help them petition in the city. Although the villagers were happy that there was one less bad person in the area, they had to follow to the city under the threat of these partisans. More than seven hundred people crammed into the City God Temple, starving for most of the day. Later, they didn't hear any news, and one by one, they secretly fled back.</p>
<p>What I have said above is entirely about the situation of the sentinel station in my hometown. As for whether the sentinel stations in other places are also like this, I dare not say. However, in a local newspaper in a certain county in Jiangbei in September, I saw a notice stating that "Recently, it has been heard that some sentinel stations in various villages have privately lent firearms to bandits for robbery, which is extremely illegal..." It can be seen that it is similar to what happens in my hometown. As for whether the sentinel station has corrected itself after receiving this solemn notice, the following two news items can answer that question.</p>
<p>1.  Fu Xiang, the abbot of the God of Wealth Temple in Du Ju Township, Fifth District, had a godson, Dai Yushou, from the Guanjiazhuang Village in Zhang Feng Township of the same district, two years ago. Therefore, the monk introduced Yushou to study at the Dujiazhuang Elementary School. At the end of last month, Yushou went home due to some matters and did not go to school for many days. The principal of the school, Ye Rongbin, immediately asked the monk to urge him to return. As soon as he arrived at Yushou's home, a heavy rain suddenly fell, preventing him from returning. The sentinel station's Ding Guan Tai and Xiao Zhengxin and others went to Yushou's house with guns. They claimed that a stranger had come to his home, and why had he not reported it to the bao head? They said that he must be severely punished. They fired two shots to intimidate him in every possible way. Later, after the Bao head Ken Yingguang and villagers Xiao Yingshu and others mediated, Dai Yushou wrote a ten-yuan voucher before they were released.</p>
<p>2.  Xiao Decan from Xiaowan Village, Gengdai Township, First District, was addicted to smoking opium. Yesterday, he sent his daughter Zhennv to the city to buy tobacco. On her way home, she passed the Fangjiazhuang Sentinel Station and was suddenly robbed of ten yuan by a strongman. Zhennv was too young to resist, so she cried and went home.</p>
<p>I don't want to write any more about the illegal actions of our Jiangbei sentinel stations. The purpose of establishing sentinel stations, as the name suggests, is to have them assist and protect the villages. Now, not only can they not help and protect the villages, but they have also become an agency that extorts and exploits the people. What else is there to say? Some people say that the reason why the Jiangbei sentinel stations are so harmful to the local area is due to three reasons: First, the director is not a proper person; second, the sentinel station workers are not local farmers; and third, the sentinel station workers only receive three yuan a month, which is too little pay. We also agree with this. However, the reason why the sentinel station is organized in this way is still caused by the local feudal forces. We believe that the local feudal forces are a source of disaster, and the sentinel station is just one manifestation of this source of disaster. If the root of the disaster is not removed, the sentinel station will forever become a tool for exploiting the masses of farmers!</p>
<p>Note 1: "Bureau Chief" is the term used by farmers to refer to the director of the sentinel station. The director often calls himself "Bureau Chief."</p>
<p>Note 2: "Smoke Lamp" is the common name used by farmers for opium smoking dens.</p>

<p>The late painter Zhang Xian had studied in France twice. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to art tirelessly for twenty years. His recent works, including line drawings of ladies and oil paintings of landscapes, are particularly moving in their lines and colors and have a unique style. Unfortunately, he was talented but short-lived, and died with unfulfilled ambitions. His friends have selected more than 300 fine works from Zhang's more than 2,000 posthumous works and are holding a public exhibition for five days in the hall on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company. Mr. Cai Jiemin will personally hold the opening ceremony this afternoon.

There were four major groups arriving in September, including 52 people on the Grand President of the Dollar Steamship Company on the 2nd, 87 people on the Empress of Japan of the Shipia Steamship Company on the 8th, 40 people on the President Jefferson on the 16th, and 30 people on the Empress of Asia on the 21st, totaling 214 people. Prior to this, the Consul in Seattle, Lu Shiyin, contacted the US Immigration Bureau, Customs and other authorities, and went to Victoria to secretly explain the procedures for dealing with immigration and customs inspections of luggage and passports, in order to avoid unexpected problems. In order to facilitate the students' landing and save time, Consul Lu also requested the Immigration Bureau to send personnel to Victoria to check passports on the ship. The students all felt convenient, and no one was detained. After landing, Consul Lu accompanied them to the Madeng Hostel opened by overseas Chinese for rest. The owner of the hostel offered preferential rates for students, with rent of only 2.5 jiao per person. After the students arrived, the Consul also specially prepared tea and snacks to entertain them.

<p>After the first sentence of Article 1 of Chapter 7, add the words "Directly kick out of the penalty area." The full sentence reads as follows:</p>
<p>If the ball is kicked over the end line by a player of the opposing team, any player of the team to which that end of the goal belongs shall place the ball within the goal area closer to where it went out of bounds and kick it directly out of the penalty area, which is called a goal kick.</p>
<p>(Referee's Note) When taking a goal kick, the goalkeeper shall not use the example of holding a ball kicked up by a teammate with his hand and then kicking it out again.</p>
<p>The goal kick must be kicked directly out of the penalty area from within the goal area. If the ball fails to kick out of the penalty area, it shall be retaken.</p>
<p>Add the words "between the two goalposts" to the first sentence of Chapter 10. The full sentence reads as follows:</p>
<p>When taking a free kick, the players of the opposing team, except those standing on the end line between the two goalposts of their own side, shall not stand within a radius of ten yards from the ball before the ball is kicked out.</p>
<p>(Note) The above sentence is only a revision of the wording, and the meaning of the text has not changed.</p>
<p>The first sentence of Chapter 12 is changed as follows:</p>
<p>The iron nails used on the players' football shoes must be nailed into the leather, and the players shall not wear football shoes or shin guards with metal plates or other protrusions or rubber.</p>
<p>(Old Rule) Players shall not wear football shoes or shin guards with nails (excluding those with nail heads exposed on the leather) or metal plates, or other protrusions or rubber.</p>

<h3 id="e99">The Guiding Principles of Physical Education for National Revival <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Cheng</p>
<p>Address at the Opening Ceremony of the Shanghai Municipal School of Physical Education on October 12th</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Distinguished guests, fellow students, today is the opening ceremony of the Shanghai Municipal School of Physical Education. I am deeply honored to serve concurrently as the principal of this school.</p>
<p>The reason why the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to establish this school of physical education is that its purpose is profound and far-reaching. Although the financial situation of Shanghai is currently very strained, why did we resolutely decide to establish this specialized physical education school under such circumstances? I had this idea a long time ago. When the Shanghai Municipal Government planned to build a sports field, I already had this idea, which was to attach a physical education school to the sports field to make full use of this large sports field. Because this sports field is not only the largest in China, but also the largest in the Far East to date. Since we have built such a large sports field, we cannot leave it empty and unused. Moreover, it will be more convenient to run a physical education school attached to such a magnificent and relatively well-equipped sports field in the future. Therefore, when the Municipal Government built the sports field two years ago, I already had this idea. But why is this physical education school only being established today? The first is the issue of funding, and the second is the situation. Today's economy is, of course, still as difficult as before, and today's situation is not necessarily better than before. So why are we resolutely establishing this physical education school today? There is a major impetus, which is the decision of the Chinese delegation to participate in the World Games, which caused us the greatest shame and gave us the greatest lesson. What we consider shameful is not because the Chinese delegation did not get any points, but because our physique is so far behind compared with those of other countries in the world that it cannot be measured by miles. This can indeed be said to be the hidden worry of China's national subjugation and racial extinction. Even without external troubles, if the physique of our people continues to decline, our nation will not be able to compete with others and will not be able to survive in today's fiercely competitive world. This has given us the greatest stimulus, so we disregard everything. No matter how difficult the finances are or how bad the situation is, we still resolutely establish this physical education school.</p>
<p>Our physical education school has its own unique spirit. The common misconception among people is that the purpose of running a physical education school is to train athletes to promote the school. This view is very wrong and very dangerous. The reason why we promote physical education is not simply to train athletes, let alone to run a physical education school only for participating in sports meets. We must use various methods and aspects to forge a healthy physique so that the physique of the whole nation can be equally healthy. After the physique of the whole nation is healthy, we will select outstanding athletes from the healthy physique of the whole nation to participate in sports meets. It is definitely not putting the cart before the horse to train athletes just for participating in sports meets. Moreover, strictly speaking, our athletes should be selected from people of any occupation in the country. Only athletes produced in this way can truly represent such a powerful nation. Therefore, we must vigorously correct the current wrong physical education policy, because the greatest purpose of our promoting physical education is to forge a healthy physique for every individual of the whole nation, so that the people can use their healthy physique to engage in their respective careers and have the confidence to succeed in their careers. If the physique of every member of the nation is healthy and their careers can be successful, then why should the entire nation worry about not being able to revive and develop? Foreigners often ridicule us Chinese as "sick men of East Asia." Why do foreigners ridicule us Chinese as "sick men of East Asia"? Why do we not know shame or strive to improve after being ridiculed by others? Because we have never been able to see clearly where our illness lies. In ancient China, both literature and martial arts were equally emphasized, so hunting and reading were equally important, and horsemanship and music were equally valued. After the Song Dynasty, the six arts were completely abandoned, and people specialized in studying and annotating texts. Since then, a trend of valuing literature over martial arts has developed, and the physique of the people has declined day by day, so they are called "sick men of East Asia." But we ourselves do not know where our illness lies, which is really dangerous. People with superficial views believe that China lacks a strong navy, a sophisticated air force, modern artillery, and strong fortresses, so it is called "sick men of East Asia." Therefore, they demand that the government expand its military equipment every day to resist foreign insults. Of course, military equipment is very important, but can airplanes fly by themselves? Can warships sail by themselves? Can military equipment and fortresses fully exert their combat capabilities by themselves? These all require people to drive and use them, but where are the people? Can people with weak and unhealthy physiques drive them? Will they have the spirit and courage to endure hardship and command? Therefore, if people's physiques are not healthy, airplanes, warships, and artillery are useless. Now, most of our people are still not ashamed of being called "sick men of East Asia," and they still do not know how to strive for improvement or how to extricate themselves, which is a great hidden worry for the nation. President Chiang Kai-shek is worried about this, so he wants to promote the New Life Movement to stimulate the spirit of the people across the country and fundamentally remove the name of "sick man of East Asia." Now, the lives of our people fully display morbidities such as arrogance, complacency, laziness, cowardice, sloppiness, disorder, self-abandonment, and selfishness. How can a nation living like this not be weak, not perish, and not be bullied by others? The most important and fundamental work of implementing the New Life Movement should start with physical education, because the Ministry of Education stipulates that the goal of physical education is to cultivate various virtues such as obedience, endurance, self-government, courage, unity, mutual assistance, and discipline. If we can cultivate the virtue of obedience, we can sweep away the past morbidity of arrogance. If we can cultivate the virtue of endurance, we can sweep away the past morbidity of complacency and laziness. If we can cultivate the virtue of self-government, we can sweep away the past morbidity of self-abandonment. If we can cultivate the virtue of courage, we can sweep away the past morbidity of cowardice. If we can cultivate the virtue of mutual assistance, we can sweep away the past morbidity of selfishness. If we can cultivate the virtue of discipline, we can sweep away the past morbidity of disorder. In short, we must eradicate all the morbidities of the past and replace them with virtues such as obedience, endurance, self-government, courage, unity, mutual assistance, and discipline. If every member of our nation possesses these virtues, our nation will surely be able to revive quickly. This is the highest goal of our physical education. In addition, what you should pay attention to is that physical education in the future should be integrated with military affairs. After the European War, the physical education policies of various countries are different from before. Their teaching materials and methods all emphasize stimulating the spirit of the people to struggle. In addition to strengthening the physical and mental health of young people and the people, they also have the purpose of incorporating military training into physical education. For example, Italy regards physical education as an urgent task for national revival. For example, the Soviet Union regards sports meets as a "production and national defense examination" for the people across the country. Therefore, the establishment of our school is not just to train a few excellent athletes, but to train teachers who integrate physical education and military affairs, and to further seek to popularize physical education among the people so that the people across the country can have healthy physiques. We hope that our school can become a center for mass physical education in the future. After the opening of school today, I hope that the principal, faculty, and all students will thoroughly understand the government's intention in establishing this school, recognize our goals, and work together to fulfill its mission.

<h3 id="e111">Social Affairs Bureau Petitions the City Government to Prohibit the Export of Our Country's Food, Ordering the Suppression of Soaring Food Prices and the Crackdown on Speculation; Various Trade Associations Voluntarily Refuse to Sell to Foreign Merchants, and Propose Measures to Regulate Domestic Food Supply and Transportation <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to stabilize the price of food for the people, instructed the Soybean and Rice Trade Association and others to prevent price increases, and reported to the Municipal Government, which forwarded the request to the Central Government to prohibit exports. Various food organizations have voluntarily prevented price increases and exports, and have proposed measures to restrict transportation to various regions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Prohibition of Exports</p>
<p>Since the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting of various food organizations to stabilize rice prices, in addition to instructing the Soybean and Rice Trade Association and other related organizations to prevent the increase in prices of rice, wheat, flour, etc., the bureau also submitted a report on the meeting's proceedings and the two stabilization measures decided upon by Director Pan Gongzhan to the Municipal Council meeting. At the same time, it reported to the Municipal Government, which forwarded the request to the Central Government to prohibit the export of rice, wheat, flour, etc., in order to maintain the food supply for the people. Meanwhile, the Food Supply Division of the Fourth Section of the bureau dispatched staff members to various locations to monitor the situation, and those who deliberately raised prices would be severely punished.</p>
<p>Suppressing Soaring Prices</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Instruction to the Soybean and Rice Trade Association and other organizations, Hai Zi No. 362, states: "It has been found that the recent surge in food prices has had a significant impact on the food supply for the residents of this city. According to investigation, this year's food harvest in various regions is abundant, and production has increased. Furthermore, the daily arrivals of goods have not decreased. At this time when new goods are entering the market, such a phenomenon should not occur. In order to protect the livelihood of the common people, this bureau cannot ignore the situation. In addition to dispatching personnel to thoroughly investigate any speculative manipulation, once verified, those responsible will be punished. The association is hereby ordered to comply and effectively suppress the soaring food prices in order to value the people's food supply. This order is issued."</p>
<p>Stabilizing Food Prices</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Gu Xinyi, a leader in the grain industry, yesterday morning. According to him, since the Social Affairs Bureau convened various food organizations to discuss and decide on stabilization measures, the various trade associations of miscellaneous grains, soybeans, rice, etc., immediately instructed their members to stop raising food prices. Currently, food prices have fallen back, approximately 40 to 50 cents per dan lower than the highest point. The previous price increase was actually caused by rumors about the current situation. This is a temporary phenomenon because this year's late rice harvest in various regions of our country has been plentiful, and there is no concern about a shortage. Therefore, there is no reason for a surge in prices.</p>
<p>Trade Association Refusal</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to prevent the export of our country's rice, wheat, flour, etc., various trade associations of miscellaneous grains, soybeans, and flour have voluntarily refused to sell to foreign merchants. For example, recently a certain merchant was procuring a large quantity of wheat in Shanghai, but because Chinese merchants refused to sell, they were unable to purchase it. As for the current prices of wheat and flour, they are higher than before because the prices of foreign wheat have risen, which has led to an increase in the price of domestic wheat.</p>
<p>Regulating the Food Supply</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to regulate the domestic food supply and prevent exports, the grain industry advocates that if it is necessary to transport food out, it must be certified by the trade association, and a shipping permit must be issued before transportation is allowed. In the event of a period of short supply, the trade association may stop issuing shipping permits. This measure will be submitted by the trade association to the government authorities for approval, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Two Native Place Associations Plead for the Salt Farmers of Daishan <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Returning Stacks and Color-Changing Salt for Fishery Use</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Native Place Association, and Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Dinghai Native Place Association, jointly telegraphed President Chiang yesterday, stating: "Respectfully submit this matter: Based on a letter jointly signed by salt farmer representatives Liu Linzhao, Chen Chifu, Tang Xinian, Chu Kaiyou, Yu Danqiu, Zou Renyi, Xia Jichang, Wang Shengzhao, Yu Mingshen, Wang Chuntang, Chen Xianglin, and Wu Moyou of Daishan salt farm, stating: 'Daishan is a solitary island surrounded by dozens of miles. There are many mud flats and few fields. There are more than 10,000 households with a population of over 70,000. 70-80% are engaged in salt production, and 20-30% are engaged in agriculture, fishing, and commerce. However, merchants from other regions are not included. The prosperity or decline of commerce depends on the abundance or scarcity of salt production. In recent years, there have been continuous poor harvests, and all industries have declined as a result. Therefore, the entire Daishan Island relies on the salt industry as its core. Recently, the Daishan Salt Farm Office has been handling the return of stacks and color-changing salt for fishery use. All our salt farmers should comply with this, but there are special circumstances in Daishan farm, which are different from those in Lianghuai, Changlu, Hedong, and other places. The representatives have no choice but to present the following information: It has been found that the Daishan produces salt in mud flats, totaling more than 25,000 mu. The current measurement of returning the base of the stack is more than 100 places, and the central mud flats have been divided into 400 to 500 mu. 5000 to 6000 mu of mud flats have been wasted out of thin air. If each family of several people has 50 drying boards and needs 5 to 6 mu of mud flats, there are still more than 1,000 families whose mud flats have been designated as stack bases, resulting in the loss of livelihood for thousands of salt farmers. Therefore, the return of the stack should be temporarily postponed. First, an investigation reveals that the cost of salt production is lowest in Qingdao and Fujian, because the seawater is salty and labor is saved. Compared with Daishan farm, the opposite is true. Daishan farm has excessively diluted seawater, and salt production requires more than 100 transfers of shoulder carrying to make the salt. Therefore, the cost is heavier than any other salt farm. If free trade is allowed in the future after the return of the stack, Daishan farm will inevitably be ignored, and Daishan farm will perish without being abolished. Therefore, the return of the stack should be temporarily postponed. Second, the return of the base of the stack has occupied more than one-fifth of the mud flats, and the annual salt production will be shorted by more than 110,000 dan (Daishan farm has 250,000 drying boards, and each board produces 4 dan of salt per year, totaling 1 million dan). Even in terms of taxation, at 7.1 yuan per dan, the tax revenue will be reduced by 1.5 million yuan. It seems that it is neither beneficial to the people nor necessarily beneficial to the country. Therefore, the return of the stack should be temporarily postponed. Third, after the stacks are completed, the salt farmers must return the salt to the stack at 4 PM. This is the normal office hour for various agencies and is not surprising. However, for salt farmers, this is the time when they are working hard and cannot be interrupted. Moreover, at the turn of summer and autumn, the stacking of salt (referring to stacking and gathering on drying cups) must be done at 6 or 7 PM. During these three hours, approximately 2 jin of salt can be produced, which is a direct loss to the salt farmers and an indirect loss to the national tax revenue. It is even more difficult to return the stacks after 7 PM, as both parties will be hungry and working for the public interest. Therefore, the return of the stack should be temporarily postponed. Fourth, as for the color-changing salt for fishery use, the intention is to crack down on smuggling, but genuine salt farmers are determined not to engage in smuggling. The reasons have been widely seen in various newspapers and do not need to be repeated. However, the harm of color-changing salt for fishery use and the great impact on fishing boats, fishing factories, fishing merchants, and various fishing industries will not be discussed here for the time being. Even the suffering of our salt farmers is already considerable, but the cost has increased and the procedures are cumbersome. One party prepares the harvest, and the other party prepares the sale. White salt cannot be stained red, and red salt cannot be added to white. The small houses are cramped, the utensils are dilapidated, and leaks are everywhere. The old and young sigh. Carrying a load of red salt to exchange for a liter of rice, they are worried about uneven mixing and violating the law. The state of their distress is difficult to describe. Reading the new salt law, the simple provisions regarding fishery salt are only in Articles 3, 5, and 25, and there is no clear text on color-changing salt for fishery use. Only industrial and agricultural salt is subject to denaturation and color change, but under Article 6, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 6, the salt required may require the purchaser to provide a corresponding guarantee or collateral without denaturation or color change. This is the tax-free industrial salt that can be exempted from color change when necessary, but the fishery salt does not necessarily need to be changed. Why is this in the salt law? The denaturation or color change of salt is carried out by the salt quality inspector in the warehouse. Now, the salt farmers are ordered to do it themselves, which often leads to mistakes, which is not unfair. Therefore, the exemption of color-changing salt for fishery use should be requested. Fifth, Daishan is the second largest farm in Zhejiang, with a large output. The food for the people and the national tax revenue are very important. Of course, it is not included in the list of abolition and merger. Moreover, our salt farmers are concerned with life and death and are deeply affected. They have no choice but to weep and appeal, and directly state the advantages and disadvantages. We hope that your association will consider the circumstances and plead on their behalf. The return of salt stacks should be temporarily postponed, and the color change of fishery salt should be exempted in order to maintain the livelihood and relieve the suffering of the people. ' etc. After investigating the salt farmers' statements, there are indeed various difficulties. According to the above, the above situation is specially forwarded to your office for review and approval, and we hope that you will consider the suffering of the salt farmers and promptly order the Ministry of Finance and the Salt Affairs Administration to handle it carefully in order to relieve the suffering of the people."</p>

<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the dispute at this meeting was indeed due to the eligibility of new members, but in essence, it was a conflict between politics and business. When the association was established, there were only 20-odd members, and the nature of its organization focused on technical research. At this conference, the number of people who registered and joined the association increased to more than 100. They were quite dissatisfied with the government's policy on the marketing of black tea in recent years and intended to designate a motion in the association to oppose it. Therefore, the occurrence of the problem eventually formed a conflict between politics and business.</p>
<p>Meeting Suspension</p>
<p>According to the association's articles of association, new members can only become members after being introduced by two members and approved by the board of directors. More than 100 people joined at the same time this time. Due to the board of directors' negligence, they were not reviewed. During the first discussion, all members present voted, and new members were also nominated as review committee members. Subsequently, the board of directors saw that an unexpected change was about to occur and invoked the articles of association as a remedy, but were criticized by the new members, causing the meeting to be suspended.</p>
<p>Mediation Approaches</p>
<p>After the board of directors held a meeting first yesterday afternoon, representatives of the Municipal Party Department, Mao Yun, and the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu Huanru, invited the board of directors and one representative from each region to participate and mediate tactfully, asking them to focus on the business and release their emotional disputes. According to the results released, both parties have gradually approached an agreement and have scheduled to continue the meeting today, and it is expected that the General Meeting will be reopened tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Nanjing Ministry of Finance: It is hereby requested that the Ministry of Finance issue an order to the Shanghai New Medicine Trade Association stating that the types of imported goods inspected by the Ministry of Finance at the beginning did not include Western medicines and that Western medicines should not be included in the types of imported goods inspected, etc. After investigation, the items listed in the amended types of imported goods to be inspected include both Chinese and Western medicines. There are as many as 50,000 to 60,000 types of items, and Japanese goods only account for one-tenth, which is less than Chinese medicines. Even if there is a fear of smuggling, several types should be designated as inspection standards, so that both officials and merchants can feel convenient in handling matters, and it is more conducive to preventing smuggling. If the category of medicines is included in a general way, the scope is too broad, which is not only difficult for merchants to handle, but also causes unnecessary work for anti-smuggling agencies. It has been found that the union has established an anti-smuggling branch, and has made considerable preparations for preventing smuggling work. There is absolutely no possibility of smuggled goods being active. The request to exempt Western medicines from being included in the types of imported goods to be inspected is not excessive. We hereby telegraph the Ministry to review and approve the request, which is for the public good. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully presents this matter."</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau is quite large, and its expenses are also extremely high. Therefore, whenever business is slow, it feels the pain of not having enough income to cover expenses. After the reorganization this spring, in addition to making great efforts to develop business and increase income, the authorities also tried their best to reduce various expenditures. After the bureau publicly tendered for the various dock labors, it is expected to save more than 100,000 yuan per year, which has been published in the newspapers. According to reports, since February of this year, after the general bureau of the bureau screened and laid off employees, the number of staff in the departments has been reduced from 234 to 125, and the monthly salary has been reduced from more than 26,000 yuan to more than 16,000 yuan, saving an average of about 10,000 yuan per month. In addition, the bureau spent more than 230,000 yuan on ship repair costs from February to August of this year, which is approximately 110,000 yuan less than the 340,000 yuan spent in the same month last year. The materials and supplies used by ships and the maintenance costs of tugboats are much less than before. If it can continue to work hard to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, the future is immeasurable.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Shen Liren Establishes the Accounting System Research Association <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The two types of income tax, namely, public servants' salaries and public bond interest, were levied from October 1st. Other parts will also start on New Year's Day next year. The time is short, but the levy of income tax on profitable enterprises and freelancers must rely on a precise accounting system as the standard. At the time when the new and old accounting systems are being replaced in our country, there are no prescribed standards for the names of accounts, the method of recording, and the calculation of depreciation and bad debts. If these problems are not resolved, it will be extremely difficult to collect income tax. Accountant Shen Liren has realized this, so he used his accounting system class taught at the School of Business of National Jinan University to organize an accounting system research association, with the students of the class as the basic members. The association is divided into four groups: one is the investigation group, specializing in investigating the characteristics of various industries and the old accounting system; one is the detailed research group, drafting accounting subjects applicable to various industries; one is the account design group, compiling the styles of account books and forms for various industries; and the fourth is the fraud prevention method research group, designing the organization of internal control to prevent fraud and increase work efficiency. At the same time, professors from the School of Business in the school are hired as review committee members to review the students' research results and publish them in journals for the reference of the industrial and commercial circles across the country. It will be of great help to the collection of income tax. Principal He and Dean Cheng Ruilin of the College of Commerce have greatly approved of the organization and have agreed to allocate funds for publishing and other expenses.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the situation of the Japanese troops in North Sichuan Road and the urban area yesterday was more relaxed than the day before. There were still a small number of Japanese troops stationed in front of the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road and the Japanese Elementary School, but there were no traces of Japanese troops at the remaining intersections. However, patrol teams and military vehicles still came and went from time to time and still crossed into the urban area. The number of Japanese troops in the Japanese distillery behind No. 63 Garden also decreased. However, around 5 PM yesterday, more than 500 newly arrived Japanese sailors, divided into about ten teams, were led by officers from the Marine Corps Headquarters, paraded along North Sichuan Road, Old Bazi Road, Zha Pu Road, and Haining Road, and stopped from time to time along the way. The officers gave instructions on the direction of the streets and the roads they lead to.</p>
<h3 id="e127">]Light and Bulky Goods: Revised Freight Calculation Method by the Ministry of Railways, Effective from the 1st <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency states: The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration recently received an order from the Ministry of Railways stating that the current freight calculation method for light and bulky goods, stipulated in the Telex No. 3162, Ye Zi, dated May 31st of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), has been convenient for full carloads of light and bulky goods since its implementation. However, for less-than-carload (LCL) shipments, the weight obtained from both measurement and weighing must be compared and then selected to calculate freight based on either the converted weight or the actual weight. This not only makes it difficult for merchants to know the amount of fees in advance but also makes the measurement procedures cumbersome. Furthermore, the volumes obtained from measurement by various railway lines often differ, adding difficulties to intermodal transport. The 9th National Railway Transportation Conference last year discussed the measurement system in detail and generally agreed that it needed improvement. Therefore, the Ministry has revised the freight calculation method for light and bulky goods, along with a list of special light and bulky goods and a list of ordinary light and bulky goods, which have been reviewed and approved by various railway lines. The revision of the light and bulky goods charging method does not significantly change the existing method for full carloads of light and bulky goods, as it is deemed quite suitable. However, for LCL shipments, the current measurement-based charging method will be abolished, and charges will be based on actual weight plus a surcharge, to simplify the process and benefit merchants. The newly revised freight calculation method for light and bulky goods is listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Goods with a weight of one kilogram and a volume exceeding three cubic decimeters but not exceeding four cubic decimeters are defined as ordinary light and bulky goods and listed in the "List of Ordinary Light and Bulky Goods." Goods with a weight of one kilogram and a volume exceeding four cubic decimeters are defined as special light and bulky goods and listed in the "List of Special Light and Bulky Goods."</p>
<p>(2) For full carloads of ordinary light and bulky goods, two-thirds of the car's carrying capacity is used as the minimum weight for calculating freight. For full carloads of special light and bulky goods, one-half of the car's weight is used as the minimum weight for calculating freight. If the actual weight exceeds the minimum weight, freight is calculated based on the actual weight. If open wagons are used for transportation, the loading height should at least be the same as that of covered wagons of the same tonnage, but it must not exceed the provisions of Article 79 of the Detailed Rules for the Transportation of Goods. When using covered wagons, the wagons must be fully loaded. If they are not fully loaded or do not reach the height of covered wagons of the same tonnage, freight should be calculated based on the car's weight.</p>
<p>(3) For LCL shipments of ordinary light and bulky goods, freight is calculated based on the actual total weight plus 20%. For LCL shipments of special light and bulky goods, freight is calculated based on the actual weight plus 50%.</p>
<p>All of the above three methods and the list of light and bulky goods will be implemented from October 1st of the 25th year of the Republic (1936). The current method will be abolished at the same time. Except for the relevant clauses of the General Rules for the Transportation of Goods, which will be revised separately, you are required to comply with and implement the above. After receiving the order, the railway line has implemented it from the 1st of this month. The names and grades of special and ordinary light and bulky goods are listed below (the numbers in parentheses are the grades):</p>

<p>—Public Security Bureau Orders Strict Apprehension of the Murderer—</p>
<p>Ge Guanfu, an employee in the typesetting department of our newspaper, was suddenly attacked by his adulterous wife and her lover around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. They used a kitchen knife to sever his throat, killing him on the spot. When tenants upstairs heard the commotion, they rushed downstairs and alerted police officers on duty to give chase. However, both murderers managed to escape. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Young but Prudent</p>
<p>Ge Guanfu, also known as Fu Chang, was a native of Wu County, Jiangsu Province. He was 35 years old and had been working as a typesetter in the typesetting department of our newspaper for nine years. He lived in a single-unit shikumen house at No. 11, Duoduo Lane, Daji Road, in the Nanshi district, acting as a second landlord. He lived in the living room downstairs, while the upstairs was rented out to others. Ge was naturally gentle and prudent, and he was known for his kindness and approachability. Throughout his service, he never had disagreements with his colleagues. Moreover, due to his diligence and dedication to his duties, his monthly income was sufficient for a modest living.</p>
<p>Portrait of the Deceased Ge Guanfu</p>
<p>Remarriage to a Loose Woman</p>
<p>Ge's late father passed away last year, and his stepmother lived with him. He had three sisters, two of whom were married, while one was still young. Ge's first wife, Zhang, passed away in January of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), leaving behind a daughter named Gengdi, who is now seven years old. Four years ago, Ge remarried a woman from Wujin named Liu Xiangbao. She was 31 years old, fierce, and naturally promiscuous. It was rumored that she had a lover even before she married Ge. Ge, blinded by flattery, hastily remarried her, and soon after the marriage, domestic troubles arose, causing his colleagues to feel sorry for him.</p>
<p>Ousting the Stepmother and Cohabiting with a Lover</p>
<p>After marrying Ge, Liu bullied Ge's weakness and often turned against him. She would unleash her shrewish temper at the slightest dissatisfaction, but Ge always endured it without resistance. Little did he know that the seeds of murder were being sown. On the 20th of last month, Liu again displayed her shrewishness and abused Ge's stepmother. Terrified by her ferocity, Ge's mother immediately moved to No. 3, Linyin Road, nearby. Due to his duties at the newspaper, Ge had to go to work at the newspaper at 7:00 PM every night and could only return home after finishing work the next morning. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Liu, through the instigation of her younger brother Liu Zhisheng (who is currently an apprentice at Dada Cloth Shop at No. 11, Shengping Lane, Fada Avenue, and stopped working a week ago), began an affair with a man from Wujin named Lin Yakou, who worked at an eyewear store near the Old North Gate. They entered and exited Ge's home all day long and falsely claimed to Ge that they were cousins.</p>
<p>Accusation of Spousal Abuse</p>
<p>The adulterer, Lin, was a poorly dressed gigolo. He was in his thirties. Every night, when Ge went to work at the newspaper, Lin would become an intimate guest. Ge remained completely unaware. On the 6th of this month, Ge and Liu had another dispute over a minor matter. The next day, Liu went directly to Nanyang Hospital for a medical examination and filed a lawsuit against Ge for assault, demanding 30 yuan per month in alimony at the Shanghai Local Court. Ge also intended to file a counterclaim, and the summons had already been received and was scheduled to be heard at 2:00 PM today. However, neighbors were willing to testify truthfully for Ge. Little did they know that the tragedy would occur at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. On the morning of the 9th, Ge and his brother-in-law went to the hospital to persuade Liu to be discharged, but she refused.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Newspaper and Raising a Ruckus</p>
<p>On the evening of the 11th, at around 8:00 PM, Liu suddenly came to the newspaper to look for Ge. They then spent the night at the Asia Hotel on Sanma Road. The next day, Liu wanted to stay another night, but Ge, concerned about his work, firmly refused. They returned home together at 4:00 PM that afternoon. At around 7:00 PM, Ge intended to go to work at the newspaper, but Liu started to make a scene and refused to let Ge leave. Helpless, Ge stayed at home, causing him to be absent from work without leave, which was a violation of the rules. His colleagues were very worried, as they knew that Ge never neglected his work without a reason.</p>
<p>Sudden Murderous Attack</p>
<p>When Ge and Liu returned home from the Asia Hotel the day before yesterday, Ge's two sisters had been searching for them everywhere for a long time. When they saw their brother and sister-in-law returning, and noticed that Liu looked happy, they did not suspect anything and returned to their respective homes. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Ge and Liu went out together and returned home at 3:00 PM, buying two new pairs of shoes. Little did they know that less than a quarter of an hour later, a tenant upstairs, Zhou Datong, was taking a nap when he suddenly heard a strange noise downstairs. He woke up in shock and rushed downstairs. However, there was no one downstairs. He entered Ge's bedroom and saw Ge lying in a pool of blood, wearing a white cloth shirt, trousers, white socks, and new shoes.</p>
<p>The Horrifying Scene of the Death</p>
<p>Ge was lying on the floor with his head resting on the side of the bed. Blood was gushing from his neck like a spring. The wound was about an inch deep and three inches long, and his throat was severed. He was barely breathing. The contents of the room were in disarray. At the same time, a kitchen knife was found near the door, covered in blood. Seeing this, Zhou rushed out to give chase. However, Liu was extremely cunning and, while fleeing in a panic, calmly carried a copper pot and hired a rickshaw to escape without a trace. The tenants reported the incident to the Ximen Branch of the Public Security Bureau, and Director Yao Guangnai immediately sent police officers to investigate.</p>
<p>Strict Apprehension of the Murderer</p>
<p>On the one hand, he instructed the local bailiff to report to the Shanghai Local Court to send personnel to conduct an autopsy. On the other hand, he ordered his subordinates to strictly apprehend the murderer and bring them to justice. At the same time, Ge's mother and two sisters rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and wept over the body. The colleagues of our newspaper also rushed to the scene one after another to inspect and express their deep condolences. The neighbors all sighed in distress. According to eyewitnesses, when Liu fled, she was seen carrying a copper pot and hastily hiring a rickshaw. When the police officers and neighbors chased after her, they saw the rickshaw she was in moving away quickly in front. However, at that time, many vehicles happened to pass by, blocking the view of the pursuers, causing Liu to disappear in an instant, which was truly regrettable. As to whether Ge Guanfu was murdered by the adulterous woman Liu Xiangbao alone or together with her lover Lin, it remains to be rigorously investigated when the murderer is apprehended.</p>

<p>Since the National Goods Promotion Association of this city launched its home visit campaign a dozen days ago, the work has been quite smooth. At the same time, the Women's National Goods Consumption Association organized by the association is also scheduled to be established this month. As for the national goods broadcasting, leaders in the national goods industry will continue to be invited to give lectures. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting Areas</p>
<p>The National Goods Promotion Association of this city, recognizing that women are the managers of the household and that their relationship with the promotion of national goods is very close, resolved to conduct home visits. To ensure seriousness, it also conducted strict examinations and selected Xu Chengqing, Xu Songzi, Chen Yingfen, Lin Wen, Shen Wenxian, etc. as visiting staff. The visiting staff had previously visited famous national goods factories in this city to study the production sequence of various national goods to provide a basis for implementing the visits. On September 25th, the visits officially began, starting from the Public Concession and the French Concession. The areas of Jing'an Temple Road, Yuyuan Road, Avenue Foch, Rue de Luynes, and Route de Ghisi have been completed. The second phase of visiting routes has been assigned as follows: Avenue Joffre (Shen Wenxian), Route Cardinal Mercier (Lin Wen), Route de Koukine (Chen Yingfen), Avenue Edward VII (Xu Songzi), Route Lafayette (Xu Chengqing).</p>
<p>Visiting Situation</p>
<p>Visiting staff depart on visits with badges and cards issued by the association to ensure formality, and they carry samples, gifts, and discount coupons from major national goods factories to distribute to housewives when inquiring or take out temporarily for identification. Since the visits began, the results have been quite good. Housewives in various families have warmly received the visiting staff and provided thoughtful comfort. They mostly approve of and are willing to use various national goods. If there are any dissatisfactions, they frankly express them and instruct the female visiting staff to inform the manufacturers to make improvements.</p>
<p>Scheduled Establishment</p>
<p>In order to promote the consumption of national goods by women, the association is preparing to form the Shanghai Women's National Goods Consumption Association. The wives of the association's committee members and the family members of managers and staff of various national goods factories have successively joined as members. Recently, when visiting staff made visits to various families, they also took the opportunity to persuade them. The housewives also recognized that consuming national goods is a duty that women should fulfill, and many filled out application forms on the spot and handed them over to the visiting staff to submit for membership. Therefore, even during the preparation period, the number of members has reached more than 500. It is heard that the association has scheduled its formal establishment this month.</p>
<p>National Goods Broadcasting</p>
<p>The association's national goods broadcasting lectures held every Tuesday afternoon from 5:20 to 5:40 PM on the Ministry of Communications Radio Station have been held thirteen times with great success. The association has now decided to continue until the end of this year. The list of continuing appointed speakers and dates is recorded below: Wang Jie'an, October 7th; Wang Hanqiang, October 27th; Zai Xingyi, November 3rd; Chen Yiting, November 10th; Jiang Xiaoqian, November 17th; Lu Lusha, November 24th; Li Aokui, December 1st; Zhong Zhaolin, December 8th; Chen Jiufeng, December 15th; Shao Daren, December 22nd; Gu Wensheng, December 29th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, last month, apprehended a suspect named Zhu Jinchang at the Yan Hai Lou teahouse in the Old North Gate, who confessed to manufacturing counterfeit banknotes of a certain bank in this city. He stated that the manufacturing operation was located inside No. 12 Dunrenfang, Wangzhi Road in the French Concession. Detectives, along with the suspect Zhu, reported to the French Police Station and dispatched detectives to the address, arresting the operation's owner, Chen Xinchang, and manufacturing workers Yu Kunshan, Liu Zhongde, Xiao Weibin, Zhu Lixing, and suspects Fan Shushan, Fan Wangshi, and Li Wangshi, a total of eight men and women. Two printing presses, a large quantity of counterfeit banknote paper blanks, 99 printed one-yuan counterfeit banknotes, and printing molds were seized. After investigation by the French Police Department, the five suspects Chen, Yu, Liu, Xiao, and Zhu were sent to the Special Second Court and prosecuted for counterfeiting currency. Fan Shushan, Fan Wangshi, and Li Wangshi were found to have no evidence of a crime and were not prosecuted. After interrogation by Judge Wang Gangxu, the Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the court, requesting the transfer of the case. Because the Police Department had already filed charges, they opposed the transfer. The court ordered a postponement of the interrogation. This matter has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Wang continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. The Municipal Public Security Bureau again sent personnel to the court, requesting the transfer of the three suspects, Fan Shushan, Fan Wangshi, and Li Wangshi. After the court questioned the defendants one by one, they all confessed to privately manufacturing counterfeit currency. The court determined that the investigation and evidence were complete and ordered the opening of arguments. First, the Police Department's lawyer Gu Shouxi argued that the defendants had already confessed and should be severely punished according to law. For the defendants who were not prosecuted, he requested their release. After the defendants were defended by lawyer Zhu Dianqing, the court announced the conclusion of the arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the 20th. The five defendants, Chen, Yu, Liu, Xiao, and Zhu, were returned to custody. Fan Shushan, Fan Wangshi, and Li Wangshi were allowed to be taken by personnel from the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The Ningxing Steamer of the Sanbei Company, on a trip from Ningbo to Shanghai, had another passenger jump into the sea and commit suicide. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea Late at Night</p>
<p>The Ningxing Steamer was sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo. In Cabin No. 25, there was a middle-aged passenger who was also traveling to Ningbo on the steamer. It was decided that when the steamer arrived in Ningbo in the morning, the passenger did not disembark, claiming to have forgotten belongings in Shanghai and needed to return to Shanghai to retrieve them. Therefore, the steamer sailed from Ningbo to Shanghai the following afternoon, and the passenger still took the same cabin back to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, around 11 PM that night, the tea server Dai Alian noticed that the cabin door was ajar. Upon entering to check, the passenger was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Details of the Deceased</p>
<p>The tea server then inspected the passenger's berth and discovered a package of belongings and a letter. The envelope was addressed to the Shanghai Charity Hospital at No. 97 North Chengdu Road, Shanghai, with a request to the tea server to deliver it on their behalf. It was then realized that the passenger had committed suicide by jumping into the sea. The steamer returned to Shanghai yesterday, and the tea server delivered the belongings and letter to the address. It was learned that the deceased was a Shanghai native named Xu, a registration clerk at the Charity Hospital. The cause of suicide was said to be due to an excessive family burden and economic hardship.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Hongkou Women's Hospital Corpse Burial Case: Sentencing Scheduled, Witnesses Summoned to Testify Yesterday, Zhang Wenhua Changes Testimony, Claiming It Was Due to Surgical Carelessness <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>—Prosecutor Argues for Severe Punishment—</p>
<p>Zhang Wenhua, a 27-year-old Shanghai native and doctor at the Hongkou Women's Hospital at No. 290 Zhaofeng Road, and his concubine assistant nurse Chen Xiaobao (also known as Liang Meiyu and Xu Shuzhen, 25 years old, Shanghai native) were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for allegedly killing a woman from Sichuan named Lu Aili and a man named Yu Gengsheng on September 4th of this year and burying their bodies underground. The case was discovered by Chinese Detective Zhou Guisen and Detectives Cui Chengke and Huang Fugeng of the Huishan Police Station, who arrested Zhang Wenhua and Chen Xiaobao at No. 13, Lane 455, Tiyuan Road, French Concession, on the 2nd of this month. The police station filed charges of murder according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law. After the Special Court's initial interrogation, both defendants admitted that Zhang Wenhua had performed an abortion on Lu Aili, but due to anger, the surgery was rough, causing the uterus to rupture, resulting in unstoppable bleeding and a critical condition. At the same time, Yu Gengsheng negotiated with Zhang, leading to a murderous intent. Zhang injected Yu with an anesthetic needle and strangled both the man and woman with gauze. The court ordered further interrogation after summoning witnesses, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing and Prosecutor Zhang Zongru continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 3.</p>
<p>The number of men and women in the audience was still very crowded. Both defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. The police station's lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that all the witnesses summoned by the court, except for the maid Fei Wangshi who had returned to Wuxi, had arrived in court. He requested to question them. The witness Chen Pengfei testified that he was 23 years old, a Shanghai native, and lived at No. 704 Renzhi Lane, North Sichuan Road. The defendant Chen Xiaobao was his sister, and Zhang Wenhua was his employer. He worked for Zhang as a driver from August 29th of this year. Zhang's original name was Lao Wang, so he usually</p>
<p>called him Lao Wang. The Hongkou Women's Hospital was opened by the two defendants. The witness Yang Yufu testified that he was a night watchman at the church at No. 188 Zhaofeng Road. The remaining rooms of the Hongkou Hospital were rented by Zhang Wenhua. Chen Xiaobao was Zhang's concubine. Ren Lijin, the manager of the Huiyuanxiang Hardware Store at No. 203 Tangshan Road, testified that Chen Xiaobao came to his store early in the morning on September 4th to purchase six sheets of lead, totaling five yuan and three jiao. Tan Xiquan, a clerk at the Taifei Lime Store at No. 89 Xinji Hong Road, testified that on the morning of September 4th, Chen Xiaobao came with an eleven or twelve-year-old girl to</p>
<p>purchase 150 pounds of lime, totaling one yuan and four jiao. Chen Linchang, a carpenter at the Chen Linji Carpentry Shop at No. 314 Zhaofeng Road, testified that the Hongkou Women's Hospital was diagonally across from his shop, so he knew Zhang Wenhua. One morning, Zhang came to borrow an iron bar, saying he needed it to pry open a wooden board. He lent it to him, and it was returned the next morning. When questioned, Zhang Wenhua and the others did not object to the witnesses' statements. However, they claimed that the more than 900 yuan in cash seized was accumulated savings and was deposited in the bank. After the incident, they withdrew</p>
<p>more than 300 yuan from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and more than 100 yuan from the Jincheng Bank, totaling 450 yuan, for living expenses. The male and female victims were confirmed to be from Sichuan, but their origin was not disclosed because the abortion was a secret. The female corpse had 40 yuan on her, of which 35 yuan was paid for the abortion, leaving 5 yuan. Therefore, it was not a case of murder for money. This point can be investigated. After burying the bodies, they moved to No. 6 Min Village, Mintiniyin Road, on September 7th, because Zhang's clinic, in addition to the Hongkou Hospital, was also located at Room 315, 3rd Floor, Dalu Commercial Building, Nanjing Road,</p>
<p>rented from Dr. Hou Guangdi for 20 yuan a month, specializing in treating common illnesses. Another clinic was established at No. 370 Balibridge Road in the French Concession. Therefore, from the time of the incident until before the case was discovered, he continued to provide consultations at Balibridge Road. On September 10th, a woman came for an abortion and paid a fee of 50 yuan. He requested that all the wooden objects seized by the police at his location be sent to his father, Zhang Jinsheng, at No. 39 Weide Lane, Guangdong Street, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi. At this time, the police station's lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that although the two defendants had confessed during the previous trial that they had</p>
<p>killed Yu and Lu with anesthetic needles and then strangled them with gauze, according to the forensic report, the two victims were indeed strangled to death. Therefore, it should be determined whether they were strangled to death or strangled after death. Judge Zhong then questioned Zhang Wenhua. Unexpectedly, Zhang suddenly changed his testimony, claiming that the woman Lu Aili had indeed suffered a uterine rupture during the abortion due to his carelessness, causing blood to enter her abdomen, leading to anemia, unconsciousness, and a critical condition. At that time, Yu Gengsheng was ringing the bell downstairs. He went downstairs and</p>
<p>negotiated with him greatly. He thought that in order to remedy the situation, he needed to draw blood and infuse it into the woman's body. So, he went upstairs to draw blood with a needle. Unexpectedly, he carelessly sucked air into Yu's blood vessels while drawing blood, causing Yu to die. When he went downstairs, he saw that Lu had also died. To prevent odor and fluid from escaping, he wrapped gauze around their necks, but he did not strangle them to death. If there had been strangulation at the time, Yu and the others would have naturally resisted, and the night watchman Yang Yufu, who was sleeping in the next room, would have heard something. Therefore, the deaths of the two were due to momentary carelessness,</p>
<p>not intentional murder. His statements today were all true and without any falsehood. The previous statements were made in a confused state due to being frightened during the arrest. Chen Xiaobao also stated that Lu Aili died from the abortion, and Yu Gengsheng died from drawing blood. She had practiced nursing at the Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road for three months and had been living with Zhang for more than two years. The court verified the statements and determined that the facts of the case were clear. The court ordered the start of arguments. First, the police station's lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that the two defendants specialized in performing abortions as a regular business and that this type of behavior</p>
<p>involved harming people without any resistance and was extremely vicious. He requested that they be sentenced to the most severe punishment. Finally, the defendants' lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang argued that, according to the circumstances of the previous trials, the two defendants did not intentionally commit murder. This case originated from an abortion, and they should be sentenced according to the crime of abortion due to professional negligence. Chen Xiaobao was also pregnant and requested that her sentence be executed after she gave birth.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Zhang's concluding remarks stated that, according to the circumstances of this case, it was not like an ordinary murder case. The defendants not only killed people with slippery medical skills and treated human lives as a game, but their actions were also like bandits running a black shop. After the murder, they destroyed the corpses and eliminated the evidence, which was extremely vicious. If they were not severely punished, it would be insufficient to maintain public morality and the protection of the law. Judge Zhong ordered the conclusion of arguments and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 20th of this month. Both defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Monk Bingnan Accused of Assault Again <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Bingnan, a monk from Zhenjiang and the abbot of Zhulin Temple at 109 Longmen Road, aged 61, was previously sued in the First Special District Court by his widowed sister-in-law, Yuan Ge, for raping her and her daughter-in-law, Zhao Cuizhen. After a special trial, Bingnan was found not guilty. The court's judgment was appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Now, Yuan Ge has hired lawyer Huang Xiubo to file an assault lawsuit against Bingnan in the First Special District Court. The facts are that on October 3, the plaintiff went to the defendant's residence to retrieve clothing. Unexpectedly, the defendant used a wooden clothes-beating stick to strike the plaintiff's right ribs, left arm, right waist, and head, causing bruises all over the body. The plaintiff cried out, and Chinese constable No. 3026 arrived before the defendant released her. Subsequently, the Chengdu Road police station was notified and sent detectives to arrest the defendant and take him to the police station. The plaintiff was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. The chief constable instructed the plaintiff to file a lawsuit in court, so she went to the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court to have her injuries examined and then filed a lawsuit, requesting punishment under Article 277, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Ninth Criminal Court to hear the case, and Chinese constable No. 3026 was also summoned to testify. Bingnan claimed that Yuan Ge attacked him first, slapping him in the face. After the court verified the statements, it adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Counterfeit Coin Operation Busted on Connaught Road; Mastermind at Large, Two Accomplices Arrested <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Xu Zhengting, a Chinese detective from the Sinza Police Station, recently discovered that someone was secretly manufacturing Central Bank one-dollar counterfeit coins for profit at No. 30, Lane 580, Connaught Road. He applied to the First Special District Court for Search Warrant No. 233. The previous morning at 11:00 AM, he and a Western detective went to No. 30 and arrested Song Qing, a native of Shaoxing, without raising suspicion. No evidence was found. However, the house had a partition connecting to No. 32. They entered and found the counterfeit coin manufacturing operation. Yang Jiazhen, a native of Pinghu, and Sun Baohua, a native of Wuxi, were unable to escape and were arrested. They were taken to the police station along with three manufacturing machines, two wooden molds, one small printing machine, and a large bundle of banknote paper. Yesterday morning, Wang Yaotang, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution in the Eighth Criminal Court under Article 199 of the Criminal Law for counterfeiting currency. He stated that the mastermind was Wang Amao, who was at large, and the three defendants were hired accomplices. He requested a postponement, and the three large printing machines were temporarily stored at the police station because it was inconvenient to bring them to court. Subsequently, Detective Xu reported the details of the bust, and the small machines and paper were presented for inspection. When questioned, Sun Baohua confessed that Wang Amao had invited him to work at the operation during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The banknotes had not yet been printed, and Wang Amao had purchased the machines. He pleaded for leniency. The two defendants, Yang and Song, claimed that they had recently received a letter from their friend Tang Qianming from their hometown, introducing them to the operation to help out. Their other statements were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company, in order to improve transportation between the city center and the Special District, decided to extend Route No. 6 south from Shanghai University to Liping Road, and first extended it from the Municipal Government to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant. The Liping Road section was extended on the first of this month and connected with the Special District's Wan Road Public Bus routes. However, the section from the Municipal Government to the Water and Electricity Plant was not implemented as scheduled due to incomplete preparations. It is now reported that all preparations for the entire Route No. 6 have been completed, and permission has been granted to extend the route to the Water and Electricity Plant from October 15th. The entire fare to stations such as Jiaduo Zha Yin Road, Yin Xing Road, and Zhendong Road is 1,011 copper coins.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women and Children's Welfare Home on Xiangyin Road in Jiangwan, founded by the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, is the pioneer of Chinese women-run charitable organizations. Its purpose is to rescue women and children beggars, maids, abandoned women, and other unfortunate women. Its economic sources, in addition to a portion of the institution's production, are subsidies from the competent authorities of the membership fees collected from members. When this is insufficient, it solicits donations from the outside world. Over the past fifteen years, thanks to the efforts of the administrators and the support of the outside world, no less than several thousand women and children have benefited from it. This autumn, the Temperance Association plans to celebrate the past and encourage the future by holding its 15th anniversary this month. Mao Kelun, Wu Chengyu, Li Zhongdao, and their wives have been publicly elected to prepare everything.</p>

<p>The three Xiong sisters, sent by the Ministry to the pre-exhibition art exhibition, held at the Daxin Company's fourth-floor art gallery, was originally scheduled to close on the 12th. Now, because there are so many visitors, breaking the previous record, it has been extended to the 18th. Yesterday (the 13th) was the first day of the extension. More and more Chinese and Western guests came. From 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, they demonstrated calligraphy on the spot, and many people surrounded them to watch. Dean Cheng of the Business School of Jinan University immediately commissioned two paintings. The Xiong sisters wrote poems and titles with flying brushes and cooperated to create the paintings. Each was extremely exquisite. Dean Cheng greatly appreciated them and said that the Xiong sisters were famous in the art world and admired at home and abroad. Although they are not yet adults, their works have reached the highest level. The poems and titles written by the sisters were in the same handwriting, like those of Mr. Lu Fengshi Runxiang. If he had not seen it with his own eyes, it would have been difficult to tell who wrote them. Later, it was learned that Mr. Lu was the Xiong sisters' father's teacher. Their learning had a source, not accidental. Also, the German, English, Far Eastern, Continental, and Taimes newspapers have all had detailed reviews in recent days, praising them as an opportunity to promote and develop Chinese and Western culture, which is very different from those who are not as good as they are said to be.</p>

<p>Chen Yunsheng, a native of Shaoxing, and Cheng Guanglu and Liu Jinshuan, who are at large, jointly established a counterfeit currency operation at No. 46, Lujiazhai, Xiaodongmen, manufacturing counterfeit Central Bank banknotes. Zhou Yongtian, Liu Qinghua, and Zhuang Hongfu were assigned to transport and perform various other tasks. Tianjin, Yancheng, and other places were their largest sales outlets. This was discovered by the Nanjing Branch of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, which sent police to search the premises on the 26th of last month. They seized 1,000 yuan in Central Bank counterfeit banknotes, copper plates, chemicals, and other items. Chen Yunsheng, Zhou Yongtian, Liu Qinghua, and Zhuang Hongfu were arrested on the spot, while Cheng and Liu escaped. The Public Security Bureau transferred the suspects and evidence to the local court's prosecutor's office. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang filed a public prosecution, stating that Chen Yunsheng, Cheng Guanglu, and Liu Jinshuan had counterfeited Central Bank banknotes, as Chen Yunsheng had confessed, and the seized counterfeit banknotes and copper plates were proof. Zhuang Hongfu admitted to cooking for Chen and knowing that he was counterfeiting banknotes. Liu Qinghua admitted to transporting counterfeit banknotes. It was clear that they were jointly counterfeiting and sharing work. Zhou Yongtian cunningly denied it, but he was arrested at the counterfeit currency operation and claimed that he had just arrived in Shanghai from Yantai and was staying at Chen's residence. He also claimed that a girl was being fostered there, but he did not know her name. When questioned, Chen Yunsheng claimed that the girl was his niece, and her mother's family name was Wang. Zhou Yongtian claimed that the girl did not live there. It was clear that Zhou Yongtian and Chen Yunsheng were accomplices in the case, so they lived in the same room. Otherwise, how could others live in a place that was a counterfeit currency operation? The defendants' actions constituted a crime under Article 28 and Article 195, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The prosecution was filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. He requested the court to punish them according to law. Yesterday, Judge Miao opened the court for a hearing. The defendants hired lawyer Xu Heling to defend them. Because they all denied their guilt, the court ordered that the case be investigated further and reheard.</p>

<p>Chen Qingxing, an overseas Chinese, 51 years old, a native of Yongjia, recently returned from abroad and plans to return to his hometown. Yesterday at 10:10 AM, he inquired at the Nanshi 16th Pier about purchasing ship tickets. A wharf swindler named Zhu A Ming (a 42-year-old native of Ningbo) noticed him and offered to buy the tickets for him, saying that he could get them for half price. Chen was fooled and handed Zhu five silver dollars. Zhu led Chen to the entrance of the Fuan Amusement Park and told him to wait, falsely claiming that he would go inside to buy the tickets. Chen felt that Zhu was not a good person and followed him inside. He did not know that Zhu had escaped through the back door. Chen immediately grabbed him and reported him to police officer Zhao Ziling, who took him to the Yemiao Police Station. After questioning, the defendant admitted to defrauding the plaintiff, who was unfamiliar with the area, by falsely promising to get him tickets cheaply. He was ordered to be sent to the headquarters for interrogation.</p>

Yesterday morning (the 13th) around 6:00 AM, while they were opening the store to receive goods, four robbers armed with knives, axes, and pistols suddenly broke into the store. First, they put the store under surveillance, and then two robbers entered the room and forcibly took two leather suitcases, carried them to the store door, hired a car, and fled northeast accompanied by the robbers. Song was afraid of the weapons and did not dare to follow, allowing them to take the loot away, resulting in a loss of two hundred yuan.</p>

Chen Ziliang, seeing the indifference of his children and daughters-in-law, felt that life was worse than death, so he hanged himself in bed the night before. It was discovered in the morning, but it was too late to save him. The local bailiff reported to the local court for an inquest.

Sparks ignited the wooden walls, and the fire quickly spread, breaking through the roof and spreading to the Zhang family's building across the street in Yuanyuli (源裕里). The Hongzhen Fire Brigade arrived with pump-driven hose carts and worked hard to extinguish the fire. The fire starter, Chen Xiaocheng, was arrested by the police for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e171">"Eliminating Import Surplus" and "Frugality Movement" <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that our country's huge import surplus in recent years is the fatal injury that has led to the bankruptcy of our national economy. At present, when our country's economic crisis is so serious, we must "eliminate the import surplus" and "promote frugality," which is the only way to save the national economic crisis. In the entire national economic construction movement, we must develop national products to eliminate the import surplus and implement frugality to increase national power. These are the basic conditions for enriching the country and strengthening the people.</p>
<p>However, in the past, the huge annual import surplus included many imported luxury goods, such as perfume, cosmetics, genuine and fake jewelry, cigarettes, cigars, various alcoholic beverages, soda, candy, shark fin, bird's nest, and the like. These many expensive things should not be consumed in such large quantities today when the people are poor and resources are exhausted, but facts speak louder than words. In the recent - September 30th Shenbao, we still saw that in the first eight months of this year, the import of tobacco and alcohol alone reached more than 12 million yuan, and the import of cigarettes has increased significantly compared to last year. I think no one will be satisfied with this and feel that the future of the national goods movement still requires greater efforts!</p>
<p>Therefore, in the same day's newspaper, we also saw the "Frugality Movement" speech delivered by Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry on the 29th of this month at the Central Broadcasting Station in the capital. I think it is very agreeable. He succinctly and clearly pointed out that China's annual consumption of clothing, food, housing, and articles reaches 360 million yuan. This alone is enough to show the crisis of the Chinese economy. From now on, we must all save materials to accumulate national power. The more materials we save, the more we increase national power. He also explained that if everyone can save one yuan per year, the vitality of the national economy can be increased by 400 million yuan throughout the year. These many words are very poignant, earnest, and worth our every person's deep reflection.</p>
<p>Finally, with fervent hope, I want the current "Frugality Movement" to start with refusing to use imported luxury goods and be linked with the entire national goods promotion movement. We must all recognize the difficult times, make a firm decision, save and spend carefully, and work hard on production and construction to "reduce the import surplus" and even completely "eliminate the import surplus," opening a new path for the future of national goods. This is the fundamental plan to save the country and ourselves!</p>

<h3 id="e172">Thinking of Mr. Xiang Songmao from the 30th Anniversary of Wuzhou <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Like mustard seeds, regard money as gold,</p>
<p>Like the public, together forge gold,</p>
<p>The cause of Baling for thirty years,</p>
<p>The medicine records a lifetime's heart.</p>
<p>Diligently plug the leakage of the zhi,</p>
<p>Thinking about rising and falling,</p>
<p>This is truly not cracking the hand,</p>
<p>Difficult tasks can be undertaken.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, the sound of war rises,</p>
<p>Orioles and flowers are sadly not spring,</p>
<p>With hat and crown, step on the tiger's tail,</p>
<p>Resisting the rhythm, offending the dragon's scales,</p>
<p>Already achieved the will to become benevolent,</p>
<p>Difficult to forget the hardship of starting a business.</p>
<p>Report respect and leave eternal thoughts,</p>
<p>Loyalty and courage are always new in history.</p>
<p>This is the poem written by the author for the completion of Songmao Memorial Hall. As we celebrate the 30th anniversary of Wuzhou, and the completion of the new ten-story building, it is most meaningful and valuable to commemorate the martyrdom of Mr. Songmao. Mr. Songmao left a patriotic spirit to the country and society, which is unparalleled in its greatness and will never be erased. Mr. Huang Renzhi said that "the foundation of Wuzhou's ten-story building is built on Mr. Songmao's loyalty and courage, that is, on the spirit of loyalty, courage, and martyrdom." Mr. Wang Xiaolai said, "Today, tens of thousands of people come here, admiring not the ten-story building, nor envying the 30-year great career, but attracted by Mr. Songmao's spirit of sacrificing his career and his country." All of these are valuable words. Mr. Songmao engaged in the national goods business for thirty years, with extraordinary nature, meticulous, and regarded the people in the company as family members and disciples. Upon hearing that someone in the company was arrested, he immediately went to rescue them, and his spirit of regarding death as home and not avoiding danger can inspire future generations. The development and growth of Wuzhou's business to today's achievements can be said to be the crystallization of Mr. Songmao's efforts, and can also be said to be filled with Mr. Songmao's will and courage. Mr. Songmao has always had self-encouraging words of thirty characters, which can be recited and will never be extinguished. The sentence says:</p>
<p>In ordinary times, one should reduce desires to nurture the body,</p>
<p>When facing great events, one should accept fate and entrust life.</p>
<p>When managing a family, one must live within one's means,</p>
<p>When pursuing great righteousness, one should regard money as mustard seeds.</p>
<p>These thirty characters can show the personality of Mr. Songmao, and the development and prosperity of Wuzhou's business is indeed without end. What is desired is that those in charge take Mr. Songmao's will as their own, take Mr. Songmao's heart as their own, and take Mr. Songmao's way of treating people and dealing with the world as their rule, then Mr. Songmao will not die but live on. Not only that, but in the future, Wuzhou's business should improve its products to surpass imported goods, reduce costs to benefit patients, and research Chinese medicine to improve it and integrate Chinese and Western medicine into one furnace to enhance its effectiveness. These are all Mr. Songmao's unfinished ambitions, which are waiting for today's authorities to complete. If this can be done, it will not only be the luck of Wuzhou, the glory of the national goods industry, but also the glory of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Tianxu Wosheng Invents Method of Manufacturing Wood Pulp from Match Waste <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Qingbo</p>
<p>There is more than one Chinese match stick factory, and more than one type of wood is used, but all use planing, and the outer layer of the Zheng and the inner core of the remaining wooden sticks have always been used as fuel, which is a pity. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, Chen Diexian (alias Tianxu Wosheng), the founder of the paper mill, specially consulted with Feng Xizhi, the manager of the Guanghua Match Factory in Zhejiang Province, to request that the aforementioned waste materials be supplied for the factory's papermaking, and paper samples were made and sent to Mr. Feng, one for bleached material and one for natural color material, both of which can be used as wood pulp substitutes. However, due to the high moisture content, the obtained composition is only 13 to 15 percent, and the cost of transportation from Hangzhou to Tin is not cost-effective, so it was not implemented. Now that Chen Diexian has been hired by the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department as a special commissioner for improving paper material design, he is starting to build stoves and ponds in Fancun. In addition to using bamboo material and wild hemp bark, he is also considering using match waste materials, which can be obtained nearby. Therefore, he entrusted Mr. Feng Xizhi to re-propose the old proposal. The price and monthly quantity were agreed upon on the 25th of this month at Jiangzhuang, Dingxiang Bridge in West Lake, and all were contracted and consumed by the provincial-run improved paper material factory. Chen Diexian also agreed to publicly teach the manufacturing method so that colleagues in the match factory industry in various places can locally produce wood pulp and purchase tree bark stripped from firewood shops and this industry to supplement the composition. The wood used for charcoal burning in various places can also have its bark removed first to produce wood pulp for sale to various paper factories.</p>

<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>On the vast wilderness, without sowing excellent seeds, you cannot get a full harvest. In the vast sea of people, without seeking profound knowledge, you cannot create outstanding careers.</p>
<p>Without great courage, how can you make people believe? Without excellent achievements, how can you make history remember your name? The environment can change life, and life can also change the environment. Fearing difficulties and living in ease can only hover around the environment, while striving and being brave can jump out of the environment to do things.</p>
<p>Looking at the great men in history, they only employed fate, but were not employed by fate. Life is not for enjoyment, but to leave some historical traces on the extremely ordinary process that future generations admire.</p>
<p>The earth is constantly rotating, and life on the earth's crust is growing peacefully. Friends of the leisure class are rotten seeds on the earth's crust, while hard-working and hard-working young people are full grains.</p>
<p>Society is decadent, life is moldy, those who enjoy life still enjoy life, and those who fear difficulties and live in ease are still fearing difficulties and living in ease. This pitiful parasitic life will eventually collapse and break. Revitalize, transform, and remedy. We do not want to hope for people to help, we must find ways to save ourselves.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Hero <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>Westerners were mocked as barbarians by the Chinese decades ago because Westerners are worshipers of heroism. Hunters, knights, and even pirates are regarded as heroes. At that time, our China was still a land of culture. Military officials of the same rank had to crawl on the ground and kowtow when they saw civil officials. All professions are inferior, only reading is high. Only those who are gentle and refined are the children of scholarly families. Those with big fists and thick arms are either peddlers or unruly rogues.</p>
<p>Today, heroism has raised its head and knocked open the door of the land of culture. Then everyone knows that the Mongolian-style knightly demeanor is what young people should have. Pale-faced, hunched-over scholars may be able to sweep away five thousand people with their pen tips, but this is just empty talk on paper and is not popular. Only young people with the Mongolian-style knightly demeanor can shoulder the heavy responsibility of reviving the nation.</p>
<p>China was never a land of culture in the first place. In ancient times, our ancestors also drank blood and conquered poisonous snakes and beasts, and also conquered the late-developing Chi You. Since the Zhou Dynasty, history has told us that the founding emperors of all dynasties did not obtain the world by wielding pens. Those who obtained the world all came from carrying guns. At the same time, any dynasty that wants to maintain the ancestral foundation must not fail to cultivate military preparations. Only by cultivating military preparations can they suppress rebellions internally and conquer strong neighbors externally. The last emperors are always good gentlemen who only know how to write poetry and compose lyrics. Strength overcomes softness. This is the supreme principle of physical examination. The rise and fall of a country and nation naturally cannot escape such a formula. In this era, everyone should realize that this is no longer an era of governing the world by yielding and persuading.</p>
<p>The ancient saying says, "Success makes you a king, failure makes you a bandit." Whether you become a king or a bandit, you are always a hero in the end. Although Napoleon was defeated and his career was not successful, Napoleon is recognized as a hero in history by anyone. Although Wilhelm II was defeated and exiled to an isolated island, he is still one of the heroes. Recently, heroism has permeated the entire earth. According to what history tells us, only nations with heroism have the hope of developing and growing. Everyone, work hard, only heroes can stand upright and survive. What we need now are young people with Mongolian knight-style, big fists, thick arms, who can bear the responsibility of defending the country.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Standard Husband <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"Enduring hardship and hardship himself, only seeking happiness and enjoyment for his wife." This kind of standard husband can often be found in our human group, but it is difficult to find in other animals. Because many male animals, in addition to fulfilling the responsibilities of a husband during mating and reproduction, generally adhere to the principle of not hearing or asking about other things. So I often tell my friends in a literary way: "The reason why humans are different from animals is that husbands can fulfill their responsibilities to their wives." However, I have recently seen two things that have broken this statement, because there are also standard husbands among animals. If you don't believe it, look at the following:</p>
<p>A certain friend's house has a pair of monkeys, which are matched according to the current system of monogamy, so they lean on each other every day and can be called "virtuous couple." Later, the female monkey did not have a menstrual cycle, and her belly swelled, looking like she was going to have a son. At that time, the male monkey kept watch by her side, peeling fruits for her, catching fleas, and doing everything to serve her diligently. Later, the little monkey was born, and in addition to breastfeeding, the mother monkey, that monkey father, really fulfilled many responsibilities. I think at this time, the monkey wife must be happy that her husband can serve and be loyal!</p>
<p>Recently, I bought a pair of pigeons at the Yimiao and counted myself lucky. In just a few days, the female pigeon actually hatched a pair of small eggs. It is usually seen that in birds, hatching eggs is always the responsibility of the female, but what about the pigeons? Both sides share the burden, and the male pigeon takes up more of the hatching time. Later, the little pigeons came out. For the first half month, they could not peck food by themselves, and their father had to vomit the food he had eaten from his throat to feed the children; while the pigeon wife was very carefree, washing her feathers in the sun, preparing to make a splash!</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Mooncake's Fate <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Zhiyun</p>
<p>Who invented the mooncake, a thing filled with sweet stuffing, I don't know, but its significance is truly profound, reaching 120 points. It seems that many years ago, it was foreseen that every young man and woman would love a "Sweet Heart," which isn't that strange.</p>
<p>The mooncake symbolizes lovers, which is indeed very apt. However, in modern love unions, almost eight or nine out of ten inevitably end up on the path of a bitter end. The so-called sweetness is only an ideal during the courtship phase and a fleeting feeling in the early stages of marriage. As time passes, love is abandoned, and each goes off to find new lovers and new stimulation.</p>
<p>Eating mooncakes is exactly the same thing. Before it reaches the mouth, one imagines the sweetness of the mooncake, and one's mouth waters. While eating it, one's heart blossoms with sweetness, and the taste is endless. But once one is finished, those who deeply love it cannot help but pick up another and put it in their mouth. For those with a mediocre fondness for mooncakes, once one is finished, they let go of it. In short, once the mooncake is swallowed, everything is over.</p>
<p>Therefore, I admire even more the foresight of the founding ancestor of the mooncake, who actually made the mooncake perfectly fit all the conditions of the love relationships between men and women of today, hundreds of years later.</p>
<p>At the same time, the shape of the mooncake is round, resembling the bright moon on the night of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But how can the bright moon always be full? After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the moon wanes day by day. The mooncake's outer shape resembles the moon, and its inner filling resembles love. No wonder love can never last as long as the Mid-Autumn moon and cannot help but wane like the Mid-Autumn moon after Mid-Autumn.</p>
<p>Flowers cannot always be beautiful, the moon cannot always be round, and love cannot last forever without fading – all of these can be called "the fate of the mooncake"!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Brotherly Affection Conceals a Letter, Pitying a Weak Sister; Heavy with Poetic and Scholarly Air, Peeking Shadows Laugh at a Poor Scholar</p>
<p>His brother's face showed anger, sadness, and distress, but it was impossible to know for sure. Wuxuan waited for him to calm down for a while before saying, "Elder sister, don't misunderstand. I called you here to give you this letter because it was purely out of good intentions." Menglan remained silent. Wuxuan said, "I'm sorry, I opened the letter and read it. But based on the language in the letter, it seems that you haven't met this Mr. Zhang yet." Menglan used all her strength and barely managed to utter a "yes." Wuxuan said, "Weren't you out yesterday afternoon? Wang Ma received this letter and took it directly to Father. I was dozing nearby and saw clearly that it was a letter for you, so I lied and snatched it away. Fortunately, this letter didn't fall into Father's hands, or it would have been terrible." Menglan slightly bowed her waist and seemed to murmur a "thank you, elder brother." Wuxuan said, "I sympathize with your situation, but I can't help you much. So, since you are only corresponding with him, I can't bring myself to object. Moreover, I know this Mr. Zhang, and he is a mature scholar for his age. If you befriend him, his literary expression will surely comfort you. And I also believe he won't have any immoral behavior. I congratulate you on having such a friend." Menglan didn't know if he was speaking ironically or sincerely, and her heart was still pounding wildly. But quickly, she looked up at Wuxuan and saw that his expression was very calm and didn't seem angry. So, she said in a low voice, "Although what I did was wrong, I had no choice. Because Mr. Zhang keeps writing to me, and I can't refuse. The words in his letters are very generous, and we, as women with new knowledge, can't completely dismiss him. Besides, what he says really touches my heart. Elder brother, please forgive me." (85)</p>

<h3 id="e180">A Glimpse of the Kabuki-za Theater in Tokyo <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>In Japan's current economic boom, various forms of entertainment are naturally beyond imagination. The Kabuki-za is the largest theater in Tokyo, competing with the Takarazuka Revue. It usually performs classical plays, sometimes interspersed with modern dramas. Japanese classical plays are very similar to China's Peking Opera, with profound lyrics and abstract performances, which young people cannot understand. Chinese people can only watch their modern dramas; otherwise, the grotesque masks and the unsightly appearance of long swords and bare feet in the classical plays are truly a headache. The prices at the Kabuki-za range from fifty cents to four yen, more than ten times more expensive than movies. The audience is mostly from the middle class and above. In Japan, before a middle-class family gets engaged, the man and woman must first meet each other, so the Kabuki-za's lounge has become a place for meetings.</p>
<p>The architecture of the Kabuki-za is completely in the Japanese palace style on the outside. The cheapest fifty-cent tickets can only enter and exit through the side door, fully demonstrating its class concept. Tickets are sold a week in advance, and customers can choose their seats themselves and enter according to the number. There are no empty seats on holidays and Sundays. The stage is shallow and wide. Contrary to China, there are therefore more seats. The clapper sounds to open the curtain, and the stage is lit with electric lights to indicate the time of day and night. During performances and dialogues, music and onomatopoeia are often used, like in sound movies. Modern dramas are mostly comedies and tragedies, and the performances are more moving and easier to understand. The audience listens quietly without making noise, and the architecture is very reasonable, so every word and phrase on stage can be clearly understood by the audience. There is no music during breaks, and viewers use this time to attend to rest and smoke. When scenery is being set up inside the curtain, the sound of hammering is constant, and it is very time-consuming. In Japanese theatrical customs, famous actors must appear on stage repeatedly every night, performing several scenes. Sometimes, due to excessive fatigue, they have to play some supporting roles to make up the numbers. So, being a famous actor in Japan is very hard work. Also, if a customer has met an actor before, they can send a business card to the backstage during the performance for a visit. Then, tea, snacks, and candies are sent out to reciprocate the customer's support, which is also very unique.</p>
<p>Pu Yi visited the Kabuki-za to see a play when he traveled to Japan last year. So, the theater set up a temporary lounge for him, which has been preserved to this day and is called the "Imperial Seat," which is great for advertising. The lounge is attached to a shop, like a department store, with Chinese, Western, and Japanese food available. Because Japanese plays start at 4:00 PM and last until late at night, it is necessary to have meals in the theater. In the past, people ate lunch boxes, but now there is a dining room, which is very convenient. In addition to the dining room, various shops sell all kinds of sundries, with cosmetics and actresses' photos as souvenirs. There is also an exhibition displaying manuscript drafts of scripts, illustrations, the author's life, stage settings, and plot fragments, so the audience has another place to relax. A temporary nursery and a photo studio are located in the basement. The nursery has children's beds and is supervised by caregivers. This is very convenient for women with babies. The noise and chaos in Chinese theaters, which make people feel uncomfortable, must be improved and prevented.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Scenery of Shamian <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhen</p>
<p>Guangzhou's Shamian has not received much attention in the decade or so since the Shameen Incident occurred in 1925, but recently, because Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek visited the British Consulate on Shamian from the Whampoa gunboat, this place has rekindled people's memories.</p>
<p>Due to the Shameen Incident, Shamian has left a very frightening and negative impression on people in general. However, if we put aside all political views and focus on Shamian itself, we can come to the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p>Indeed, Shamian is quite moving. It is a sandbar next to Shameen, with an area of no more than one or two hundred acres. It is only a short distance from the Shameen Embankment, separated by a narrow river channel. In peacetime, this river channel is filled with yachts exclusively for people to enjoy.</p>
<p>"Take a river cruise!" the boat women sitting on the shore entice passersby with seductive glances.</p>
<p>Shameen and the embankment are completely a bustling street. People who are not used to the hustle and bustle may feel suffocated when they come here for a walk, but if you stroll across the exquisite stone bridge that spans the river channel to Shamian on the other side, you will definitely get a different feeling.</p>
<p>Here, there are smooth asphalt roads, and green lawns are scattered on both sides of the road. Near the riverbank, dozens of huge-trunked shrubs are neatly planted. When the branches and leaves are lush, the graceful shade covers the road. The sunlight shines through the gaps in the branches and leaves, forming countless small circles, like a beautiful pattern. Occasionally, a breeze blows, and the leaves rustle. The noise of Shameen and the embankment on the opposite bank is covered by this natural sound. In this short distance of ten or so feet, two completely different worlds are divided.</p>
<p>Many benches are placed on both sides of the road. When tired, you can sit down here. In the depths of the green shade, you can often see a corner of red wall, some of which are banks opened by Westerners, and some are Westerners' residences.</p>
<p>If you walk further, you will reach the embankment on the other side. In front of you is a vast river surface, which is the famous White Swan Pond since the Republic of China. The pond is very deep, and many foreign merchant ships and warships are anchored in the middle.</p>
<p>Every evening, you can see couples returning from the tennis courts, arm in arm, waving their light rackets, humming popular love songs. The sound of their synchronized footsteps gradually disappears with their figures.</p>
<p>At this time, you may also feel a different foreign atmosphere.</p>
<p>In any case, Shamian is beautiful and quite moving.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Yarn and Cotton Price Rises Again, New Companies Spring Up Like Mushrooms; Marked Yarn Price Soars; October Peak at 216.9; Long-Term Rise Slower, Transactions Very Active <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to be strong and the price increases are fierce, because yarn sales are brisk, spot goods are tight, the short sellers are in a panic to cover their positions, and the longs take advantage of the opportunity to be active. The market surges forward. The October futures open and jump, and the atmosphere of tightness reaches its peak. The frequency of transactions in the southern market is said to be a new record recently. The morning session closes at 1:30 PM, the afternoon session is extended and opens at 4:00 PM, and closes at 7:00 PM late at night.</p>
<p>This Month Jumps 3.8 Yuan</p>
<p>The marked yarn market opened today because the spot yarn market is surprisingly strong. Although sales volume from customers is less than the previous day, there is a shortage of spot goods everywhere. Therefore, people's hearts are unusually hot, and buying is strong. The floating shorts start to cover their positions, and the trend for October is urgent, rising step by step. The high price closes at 215.9 yuan. The long-term upward momentum is slightly moderate, and both the long and short sides have considerable moves. According to investigations, Gengfeng, Xingchang, Changyu, Fengtai, Shenji, Renfeng, Taichang, etc. sold in large quantities, while Tongji, Hengyi, Hexing, Changji, Changfeng, Dachang, and Fukang purchased in bulk. As a result of the marked yarn, this month rose 3.6 yuan, and the long-term rose 1.12 yuan. The afternoon opening was slightly lower in the near term, but when it came to the long term, many short sellers covered their positions and turned tight. In the second session, the near term jumped 1 yuan, and the far month followed suit. At the time of closing, most people took profits. At the same time, the evening news was unfavorable, and the selling pressure suddenly increased and fell back 7 or 8 cents to 1 yuan. As a result, each month rose another 2.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. According to the investigation, Gengfeng sold 5,950 bales, Xingchang 2,700 bales, Fengtai 3,050 bales, Shenji 5,950 bales, Renfeng 2,300 bales, Yicheng 1,850 bales, Yichang 2,100 bales, Run Kang 1,100 bales, and Shengyuan 1,000 bales.

<p>The cotton market has been sluggish due to pressure from short sellers for several days. Now, with the help of brisk yarn sales, people's hearts are greatly shaken, floating accounts cover their positions, and the longs suddenly pull up the price. The market price is also skyrocketing. The current cotton mills need good quality, and the October futures have risen out of the 40 yuan range.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Opens and Rises</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened today. The price increase this month is fierce. Although the short sellers used coarse cotton to put pressure, it was found that their short positions were huge. In addition, yarn sales are brisk and the mills need a lot of cotton. People's hearts are therefore turning stronger. However, large households still instructed to sell continuously. Therefore, the price increase is not as strong as the yarn market. According to the investigation, Juxing, Yuda, Hexing, Shenchang, Changfeng, Shengyuan, Yikang, etc. sold in large quantities, while Jifeng, Gengfeng, Xingchang, Changyu, Dachang, Yuanxingchang, and Xincheng also covered their positions in large numbers. As a result of the marked cotton, this month rose by 8.5 cents compared to the previous day's closing price, and the long-term rose by 4.56 cents. The afternoon opening, except for a small 5 cent dip in the current month, all other months jumped 3 or 4 cents. The households that used to sell cotton and buy yarn have already switched. Therefore, the market price is rising higher and higher. However, at the time of closing, it became softer again. As a result, each month rose another 5 cents to 1.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. According to the investigation, Xincheng sold 13,000 dan, Yongda 4,000 dan, Zhenda 8,000 dan, Yikang 3,100 dan, Shengyuan 15,700 dan, Changfeng 14,500 dan, Shenji 6,500 dan, Shenchang 7,500 dan, Hexing 8,300 dan, Dafeng 4,800 dan, Yuda 7,700 dan, Juxing 9,200 dan, and Dafu 7,500 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was fueled by the still-raging yarn market, and spot yarn and thread were out of stock. Because cotton cloth sales are surprisingly brisk, the various weaving mills need more and more raw material yarn and thread, and they are now inevitably very panicked. The selling prices of various goods are therefore rising even more. In a short period of time, the market conditions are inconsistent. In total, the price of each piece of coarse cloth, light and heavy weight, rose another 5 cents to 1 dime. The price of each piece of Dong goods fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, and coarse twill rose 5 cents. The price of each piece of local factory fine twill and coarse twill rose 1.2 cents. The price of blue cloth dyed twill also rose 1 dime, while the price of each piece of natural color twill velvet, Zhigong, Biji, and woolen cloth rose 2.3 cents. This is because the expansion of Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong is becoming more and more prosperous, and the Northwest, Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong are also doing their best to absorb them. The situation is becoming more and more tight, and the relationship between supply and demand is very different, resulting in this situation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market was extremely excited, and the market had already reached its peak. The price of each month's product has been forced to halt price changes in the afternoon, because the stock exchange, based on the previous rule, dictated that the price could only be raised by 10% each day. This situation, not seen since last June, is now happening again. When the price was opened, due to the price of dripping wheat, it was also up 3 or 4 cents. Outside the industry, expectations were all unified, and this month's opening price was up 34 cents, and the long-term opening price was also up 23 cents. Afterward, due to greater buying, prices also rose slightly. By the time the afternoon session had opened, the situation changed drastically again. News had spread that customers were active, factories were compensating, and moreover prices on yarn and cotton as well as the exchange rate had risen. This led to enormous enthusiasm for buying. At the beginning, near term was only up two or three cents, but finally in March it hit three yuan, seven jiao, one fen, and seven li and a half (up a tenth from the day before). Thus, since the opening of this month, prices were all inflated to the point of maxing out the dime increase each time. The market has thus been set, and the stock exchange will wait until further resolution of the matter, and will thus reopen when possible.</p>

<p>Yesterday's period wheat market, after the morning opening, saw all months of trading rise. With the price of foreign wheat having risen two, three, or four cents more, both the foreign wheat market was surging, and international currency was affecting the transfer of wheat to China. Domestically, wheat stockpiles would reportedly only last less than a year, and due to this, consumer sentiment was strong and purchases were high. The opening price for this month was up six or seven cents, with November also up between three or four cents to six or seven cents. As the afternoon opening began, due to soaring wheat prices, and outsiders also continuing to drive up the price, the market repeatedly surged wildly, with no end in sight. Ultimately the price result rose from one tenth to one and seven tenths. Watching future steps, if the government is unable to create an affordable method, it is feared the price increase will not be stoppable. Current wheat prices, due to standardized price increases, are also up a tenth. Opened Dalisheng Shandong wheat is 5 yuan and 6 and a half jiao, Yanghe wheat is 5 yuan and 6 jiao, Huai'an wheat is 5 yuan and 4 and a half jiao, second is a tenth less, Jiangbei wheat is 5 yuan and 2 and a half jiao, second is one and a half tenths less, Gaoyou wheat is 5 yuan and 4 and a half jiao, second is four tenths and one fen less, Zhuzhen wheat is 5 yuan and 2 and eight fen jiao, second is two tenths less, Nanjing wheat is 5 yuan and three jiao, Dachang wheat is 5 yuan and one jiao and seven fen, Daorenqiao wheat is 5 yuan and two jiao and eight fen, a second less, Hankou wheat is 4 yuan and 7 and a half jiao.

<p>Hakka xian has been bought again and again by northerners and southerners for several days. The market is gradually expanding. Nanyang, especially Guangzhou and Shantou, is the most greedy, and northern ocean Tianjin is also quite active. Yesterday, there was a trend of continued increase in the market. As the day reached its end, there were hot spots, and northerners actively bought He Xia geng rice, and Cantonese also competed to buy at high prices. The market began to stabilize. However, Shantou's consumption remains active. Northerners and Cantonese also continued to buy slightly, so the market's mood remained positive. A total of 3,460 packages of Gan rice were sold, 5,158 packages of Xiang rice, 220 packages of Jing xian, and 100 packages of factory xian, still totaling more than 10,000 packages.</p>

<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the sources from He Xia and other places continued to arrive, with a total of about 43 or 44 boats. The new japonica and Yang Dubu tip sold well in the market, while damaged japonica, old new Bian Yuan, and other goods were bland. The market price of damaged japonica continued to rise by several points to about a dime. The new japonica high-quality goods were fatigued by several points, and the middle position remained stable. There was no rise or fall in the new Yao species Yang Du tip. The old new Bian Yuan was bland and fatigued. The customer tip was firm.</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were similar to before, with a total of 54 or 55 boats arriving, totaling 11,3400 shi of goods. The new japonica market condition initially showed signs of fatigue, but by noon, after the Tianjin gang took action and bought 1,5600 packages, the situation turned around and the price rose back by a dime. As for the new thin rice such as Yaozhong Baige, etc., due to sluggish sales, although the buyers from Qingdao, Yantai, and Dalian bought 1,6700 packages, and the thin damaged rice was over 100 packages, the resulting price was lower by a dime. The supply and demand of Du Jian was similar, with no rise or fall. The price of foreign Jian continued to fall by 1.2 dimes in the opposite direction. Thick and thin damaged rice showed slight signs of softening. The old new Bian Yuan was short of goods and had no market.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Special Feature: Decline in Japanese Cotton Cloth Exports (Continued from the 10th Day Report) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jingshi</p>
<p>Exports to the Dutch East Indies in the first half of the year amounted to 1,679,960,000 yards, a decrease of 28,884,000 yards, or 14 percent. This is the second-largest outlet for Japanese cotton cloth, second only to British India. However, the changes in this trade are of a drastic nature, resulting from the deterioration of relations between Japan and the Netherlands. Exports to Egypt totaled 47,868,000 yards, a decrease of 28,613,000 yards, or 37.4 percent, compared to the same period last year. In July of last year, the Egyptian government announced a trade agreement with Japan, imposing a 40 percent countervailing duty on Japanese goods starting from September 20th. Subsequently, Japan and Egypt held negotiations in Cairo on October 20th of last year regarding the cancellation or modification of the countervailing duty, but the outcome was ultimately unsuccessful. The Egyptian cotton cloth market is actually Japan's fourth-largest outlet, its importance only falling behind the four Northeastern provinces.</p>
<p>Exports to Colombia were completely cut off this year, as the commercial agreement between Japan and Colombia was abolished on April 30th of last year. Subsequently, mutual benefits were restricted, leading to a cessation of trade. As for cotton cloth imported by Iran from Japan, the figure for last year was 23,820,000 yards, also a decrease of 3,507,000 yards, or 36.2 percent. This was due to the enactment of a new law in that region on May 22nd of last year, stipulating that all goods imported from Japan would be subject to an import duty of 15 percent ad valorem. Therefore, there is not much hope for the future of trade with that country. Exports to Cuba saw a percentage decrease as high as 97.9 percent, with a quantity of 9,636,000 yards, which is not insignificant. Cuba had also announced in March of last year the imposition of a 25 percent dumping duty on imports of Japanese cotton cloth and 100 percent on rayon. Recent negotiations between the two parties may lead to an agreement on a minimum tariff rate for Japanese goods, provided that Japan imports half the export value from Cuba.</p>
<p>Furthermore, concerning Argentina, a South American country, the quantity of Japanese cotton cloth exported during the first half of the year was 45,353,000 yards, a decrease of 16 percent, which is more unfavorable compared to England. Moreover, the country's export association has stipulated that a 5 percent control tax be levied on imported goods to subsidize exports. Similarly, exports to Haiti in North America have also decreased by 75 percent, mainly due to a 100 percent increase in tariff rates. In El Salvador, 20 years ago, 9 million yards of cotton cloth were imported from Japan. Subsequently, effective measures were taken to limit its import, thus reducing the figure to 170,000 yards. This method is attributed to the strict imposition of a 200 percent import duty, while simultaneously reducing the tariff on local exports by 25 percent. These are the facts of the past two years.</p>
<p>Regarding Australia, there has been no significant change in the past six months. However, the new tariff regulations in May stipulate that cotton cloth imports are subject to a 70 to 110 percent ad valorem tariff. Consequently, Japan is set to lose a significant market in Australia. Therefore, Japan is currently boycotting Australian wool in retaliation.</p>
<p>As for exports to the Dutch East Indies, a total of 249,589,000 yards were exported in the six months of this year. The amount to date has not changed much. During the previous trade year, from October of last year to March of this year, exports and re-exports from Japan exceeded 7,420,000 yards. However, the commercial agreement of the previous year was interrupted in March, and negotiations resumed in July of last year. At that time, Britain paid close attention to the progress of Japanese cotton cloth, resulting in the Indian authorities increasing taxes by 5 percent. As for Hong Kong, a free trade port with no import restrictions, imports totaled 40,399,000 yards in the first half of the year, a sharp increase of 65.3 percent compared to the same period last year. However, a portion of this was re-exported elsewhere. Imports from Japan to Northeast China reached 106,895,000 yards, an increase of 21,982,000 yards, or 25.9 percent, compared to the same period. At the same time, the Kwantung Leased Territory also saw an increase of 44 percent, with the increase undoubtedly being transshipped to central China.</p>
<p>In summary, the exports of Japanese cotton cloth are generally trending downwards. However, there has been an increase in Europe, although various countries on the European continent have increased tariffs due to their different characteristics to protect their own industries. Japan, on the other hand, has separately signed preferential treatment agreements. Therefore, the prospects for further increases, except for Germany, seem promising.</p>

<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a slight increase in pure gold, but ultimately remained suppressed. Despite swap pressures, buying interest was still strong, with frequent rebounds mid-course. However, the stock market weakened, leading to a final decline. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London level, the U.S. halt, and New York and Montevideo commercial markets all suspend trading. Exchange rates opened slightly higher, with London's raw gold rising half a penny. The Central Bank's listed prices showed both British and American currencies unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained stable. The standard bid price was listed as rising to 1154 yuan. Off-exchange pre-market trading opened at around 574 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, Decheng, Yuanmao, Yongheng, and others were selling, leading to a weakening trend. The morning opening was slightly higher, but due to increased bullish activity, it briefly rebounded. However, sellers remained crowded, and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) listed prices showed both British and American currencies unchanged, gradually declining. However, there was some support after the initial drop. Silver balancing tax was announced as unchanged. At this point, there was a slight rally, but buying interest was only temporary, and it remained difficult to rally. In the afternoon, large bearish investors increased their positions, leading to a continued weakening. However, due to the closing price being suppressed, there were buyers taking advantage of the low prices. Although swap rates still required bullish investors to pay over one yuan, the annualized rate was not high enough to affect market sentiment. After the initial drop, there was a gradual stabilization, with bullish investors closing out their positions. The final result was still not optimistic. The Indian silver price remained unchanged twice, making it difficult to change. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1153.2 yuan, a rise of 0.1 yuan compared to the previous close. Hengchang, Yongji, and retail investors entered the market, rising from 3.1 yuan to 3.8 yuan. Qiafeng, Yongcheng, Dayuan, Yuanmao, and Yongda Decheng took advantage of the high prices to sell, retreating to 2.9 yuan. Hengyu, Fuxing, and Yongshang were still accepting, rising to 3.4 yuan. Yuanmao and Yongshengyuan sold, retreating to 2.8 yuan. After fluctuating, the noon close was 1152.9 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was 1152.9 yuan. Daheng sold, retreating to 2.7 yuan. Wanxing, Yuanmao, Yong, and Qiafeng bought, rising to 3.3 yuan. Bullish investors took some profits, leading to a slight decline, forcing the close at 1152.9 yuan. After the close, Da Decheng sold, continuing the weakening trend.</p>
<p>The closing price was based on the Central Bank's standard bid price, listed as rising to 1154 yuan, indicating a suppression of 1 yuan compared to the closing price. The accounting price for this month is 1148 yuan, and for November is 1153 yuan. The morning make-up water was 1148 yuan, and the red gold was increased by 8 yuan to 1161.2 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were increased by 14 yuan. The price of cooked red was 12 yuan but no transaction was made, the selling price was increased by 17 yuan and a half, more than one hundred taels were sold by Tongfeng, Hengshengyuan Yong.</p>
<p>There were not many transactions in the market. In total, Zhi, Yongwan, Tongtaichang, Dingkang, Xiangfeng, Hengchangyong, and others were buyers, while Yuanmao, Yong, Fuxing, Yong, Shengyuan, Yongda, Decheng, Daheng, and others were sellers. Shenda Yong advanced before retreating, and Qiafeng, Yongqian, Yuanmao Yong, Fuxing Yong, and Hengyu retreated before advancing.</p>
<p>The day's market conditions were peaceful, with the morning opening at 1153.2 yuan and the afternoon closing at 1152.9 yuan. The highest was 1153.8 yuan and the lowest was 1152.7 yuan, with a range of 1.1 yuan. The final result was a slight decrease of 0.2 yuan compared to the previous close. This month's low certificates have 462 remaining besides the public orders. The total number of monthly chips is 7791, with a total of 35 bullish investors and 30 bearish investors. The total number of transactions was 861 in the first half and 357 in the second half.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 28 public orders were released by Yongfeng. Those due to be received today include Qiafeng, Yongda, Changxiang, Dadecheng, Futai Heng, and others, each with an amount to be received, with a closing price of 1148 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's stock market saw a hardening due to the selling of Chinese and Japanese businesses. Certain banks were buying shillings. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that London's major contracts were close to leveling. New York market conditions were paused. London's raw gold rose half a penny. The British currency rose 125 against the American currency, and the British currency rose 3 pounds against the French currency. The Central Bank's listed prices showed both British and American currencies unchanged, and the customs gold unit remained stable. The stock market's morning opening saw recent selling prices, with the British currency at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4375, and the American currency at 29.5 yuan, or 53125, slightly loosening compared to the previous close. After the opening, people were unsettled. Japanese banks sold British and Japanese currencies, doing foreign exchange swaps. Japanese banks also sold American dollars, and many banks were still buying. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) listed prices showed both British and American currencies unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was also unchanged. At this point, things were still peaceful. After entering the market, banks sold shillings, and Chinese businesses were still buying, resulting in a fluctuating situation. Certain banks were still buying shillings. By noon, things had gradually stabilized, and trading was limited in the second half. Foreign banks continued to sell shillings, and some were still buying. The Indian silver price was reported as unchanged twice. The final situation was stagnant. The closing selling price for the spot British currency was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 4375, and the American currency was 29.5 yuan, with the British currency slightly loosening and the American currency unchanged compared to the previous close. For the forward currency, the British currency loosened by 03125 and the American currency loosened by 1875. Chinese and Japanese businesses slightly sold American dollars. The day's transactions are recorded below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange's market conditions were extremely stable. Both sides were in a wait-and-see mode, anticipating new developments after Mr. Sangshima's return to his home country. However, they were unable to discern the advantages and disadvantages, so people were uneasy, and buying and selling were both flickering and uncertain. Trading was therefore greatly reduced. Changes are expected within one or two days. The day largely saw fluctuations with a slightly soft trend. Only this month's Wu type opened slightly firmer by one jiao, while the rest gradually weakened due to the rush to sell the No. 11 bond, dropping by 0.1 to 0.2 jiao. The closing saw stronger selling pressure, with 43 and 53 both being sold, and the market price falling slightly by 0.1 to 0.25 jiao. In the afternoon, fluctuations intensified, with different opening highs and lows, completely fluctuating within 0.05. Several types of closing prices were unchanged, while the rest were still fluctuating, varying by about 0.1 jiao to the left. The final market price was slightly weaker by 0.1 to 0.3 jiao. Wu type this month was still good by 0.05. The total number of transactions was only 3.36 million yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The new goods of Nantung yellow euryale seeds have been entering the market one after another. The initial arrival reached 67-68 yuan, but recently it has gradually loosened. Yesterday, the market sold high-quality goods for 55-56 yuan, and the pond euryale net goods for 17-18 yuan, with a slight reduction. The raw sun-dried dried longan is now rare, and the market price in the production area has risen, so yesterday's market has already opened up to about one yuan. Today's market sales are bound to increase accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Sugar Market Dutch and Red Sugar Arrival and Inventory Both Scarce <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The Association's market price was 21.8 yuan for No. 24 raw sand white spot goods, 6.33 yuan for transit goods, 21.7 yuan for Dongbai No. 4 spot goods YP mark, 6.5 yuan for transit goods, 21.45 yuan for No. 8 spot goods YRO mark, 6.3 yuan for transit goods, and 21.15 yuan for No. 9 YRO mark, 6.05 yuan for transit goods. Due to the scarcity of Dutch and red sugar arrivals and inventory, the prices rose by 0.3-0.4 yuan. Yesterday, the price was 16.8 yuan. Ben, Mian, Rangzhen, Jinxin, Dahua, and others all remained at the original price. The market cargo of the Chao gang opened for more than 200 bags of provincial branch ocean, the higher price was 17.6 yuan, the second highest was 17 yuan, and the Qilin red was 130 bags, 15.45 yuan, and the Huanggang was dozens of bags at 14 yuan. The trend of miscellaneous Lu Qing was weaker, with no continuation of the opening.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the New York market was closed due to the Christopher Columbus holiday. In the Yokohama silk market, spot sales were still stagnant, and silk prices fell slightly by 3 yuan. The forward price was slightly higher by 3.5 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, only Guangdong silk sales rose by 3 francs, while other silk products remained at the original price. Observing the recent domestic and foreign silk markets, both are lifeless, and market price changes lack stimulation. Both the American and French markets lack interest, and users also have little purchasing interest, so the silk market is becoming increasingly desolate.</p>

<p>Yesterday's green tea market was still sluggish. Although Shanghai's various merchant houses and vendors repeatedly lowered prices to seek sales, and many telegrams were sent out last week, there were mostly no replies. Furthermore, due to the abundant overseas inventory, they are still planning to postpone the shipment of previously ordered goods. Green tea sales currently seem to have no hope of turning around. Yesterday, only Xiehe Jinlong and other firms bought more than 300 boxes of Zhenmei pearl tea. The market sentiment is said to be falling with no rise.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Seminal Emission and Gonorrhea Cannot Be Married <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Original text from Archives d'ophtalmologie, Janvier No.18, abridged translation by Dr. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian University of Labor Medicine</p>
<p>...Premarital treatment should be done as soon as possible, do not leave regrets... Difficult to disclose hidden illnesses, secret self-treatment techniques advanced</p>
<p>One of the most common phenomena of gonorrhea is the concurrent seminal vesiculitis and prostatitis seminal emission. In the acute phase, the urethra burns and itches, and it is easy to get an erection, so seminal emission is very common. In the chronic stage, the posterior urethra becomes inflamed, and seminal emission also occurs due to the swelling of the prostate and the relaxation of the seminal vesicles. Often, thick pus drips, and it is difficult to distinguish between semen and pus. If you only take diuretic or anti-inflammatory gonorrhea medicine, it will be of no use at all. Over time, the testicles also become inflamed, and frequent semen loss makes you even more exhausted, and a tragic outcome is imminent. Even if the resistance is strong, the reproductive function has been damaged beyond repair, and there will be no chance of marriage in this life. If you are married, it goes without saying that you will never have children.</p>
<p>Therefore, the disadvantages of gonorrhea not only concern the person themselves, but also affect their wives and children. For this reason, young patients who want to get married should be cured quickly before marriage in order to seek permanent happiness!</p>
<p>Scherber M.D., Director of the German Gonorrhea Prevention Institute, a famous European authority on gonorrhea in 1934, and Professor R. M. Mucha of the London Venereal Disease School in England, and Lenz Hoffmann M. D. (Venereal Disease Expert) in the United States, etc., confirmed that patients should pay attention to recuperation and diet. The most important thing is to use protein therapy, because only the protein in gonorrhea medicine can compensate for the loss of function due to inflammation in the prostate, testicles, and seminal vesicles. Therefore, the doctors strongly recommend the protein chromophore preparation "Kelinong" as the most reliable and has no side effects. In London alone, "Kelinong" was used to cure 120,071 people in the past year (more than 30,000 women with leucorrhea). As for seminal emission caused by gonorrhea, it is best to use "Nairis Seminal Emission Tablets" together for the most effective results.</p>

<h3 id="e202">Premature Ejaculation and Renal Atrophy are the Crux of Long-Term Infertility <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Original work by French Dr. Perseus, translated by Chen Minbo, graduate of the Japanese Imperial Medical University</p>
<p>Our reproductive glands usually gradually develop at the age of fifteen or sixteen. Those with sexual knowledge pay deep and unusual attention to this period. Therefore, they absolutely do not commit the two things of masturbation and early marriage. However, these young people can be said to be only 1% of the population, while the remaining 99% have the bad habit of masturbation. The reason why masturbation (i.e., self-abuse) is so alarming is that it most easily damages the reproductive gland's structure, thus preventing it from performing its reproductive task. Its most obvious symptoms are incomplete local and systemic development, premature ejaculation, and renal atrophy. This is indeed the most accurate pathogenesis of long-term infertility. But what kind of treatment should be adopted for this disease? Then, let us take the words of French Professor Saint Laurence as a reference for those with long-term infertility. He said that every young man inevitably masturbates, but many are due to early awareness or thick congenital endowments, but there are very few such people. To treat long-term infertility caused by masturbation or excessive sex, we can use "Buitikang" invented by German Merlin as an oral medicine to supplement the lack of endocrine elements such as incomplete sexual development, premature ejaculation, and renal atrophy. Because "Buitikang" is made from hormones of young animals.</p>
<p>Russia and Germany are preparing for war very fiercely. Therefore, they are working hard to encourage childbirth. As a result, "Buitikang" was praised by doctors in the two countries and widely adopted. As a result, the population is increasing day by day, especially the increase of the Sherman ethnic group, which has made great progress. Therefore, "Buitikang" is actually in charge of the medical circles of major powers. I have used this medicine to cure five or six thousand people with long-term infertility. (French Baotu Magazine, Issue 7. Translator's note: After graduating from the Department of Medicine of the Japanese Imperial University, I conducted a field test of "Buitikang" in the graduate school of the university.

<h3 id="e203">Gonorrhea and the Danger to Wife <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Parents with gonorrhea, son blinded.</p>
<p>The patient is Mr. Tao Xichang, 27 years old, who is quite romantic and self-admiring and likes to visit brothels. Therefore, the gonorrhea he suffered from has been lingering for many years. However, normally, if he is not stimulated by 12 points, his urine is abnormally clear. However, he occasionally has a dull pain in the perineum and lower abdomen. Therefore, he did not pay attention to it. Unexpectedly, after Mr. Tao's wife gave birth to a son, his eyes changed and he soon went blind. After diagnosis, it was learned that it was a gonorrheal ophthalmia. Therefore, in February of the year before last, introduced by Mr. Ge Pingxiang, he came to me for treatment. At first, a normal examination was performed, and there was no trace of gonococcus. Later, a special examination method was used to take the turbid fluid secreted after stimulation and examined it under a microscope. There were countless gonococci attached to the epithelial cells (as shown in the first picture). Then, "Kelinong" was administered to make the body produce an anti-gonococcal effect. After four follow-up visits, the medicine was taken for five weeks, and it was completely cleared, with no gonococci at all (as shown in the second picture). Even after various major stimulations, there was still no reaction. This is proof that "Kelinong" can overcome old gonorrhea. For his wife's leucorrhea, she was instructed to use "Karl Xuedishi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories to cleanse the leucorrhea. She was still given "Kelinong" as an oral medicine to clear gonorrhea, detoxify, and kill bacteria. It was completely cured in four weeks. Not long after, his wife became pregnant again and gave birth to a fat and cute baby. Mr. and Mrs. Tao were very grateful and published a thank-you note in the newspaper, in which they praised the medicine "Kelinong" very much.</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Most Advanced Method of Quitting Smoking <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>All smokers have such a question: since the central government promulgated the five-year plan for the anti-smoking campaign, the law is clear, but why are smokers still hesitating and unwilling to completely solve the addiction? However, they all have firsthand experience of the answer: it is because the most effective method of quitting smoking has not yet been invented! Most of the anti-smoking drugs are nominally real, because after taking them, there are still various pains during the quitting period, such as insomnia, back pain, sadness, night sweats, seminal emission, and mental weakness. These symptoms make the smoker unable to continue with courage, so they are afraid of quitting smoking.</p>
<p>Since the newest and most advanced Merlin's Body Anti-Smoking Method was implemented in Germany, smokers no longer have to worry about all kinds of pain. As long as you take Merlin's "Buitikang" to "supplement" the cell function and egg yolk pigment of the "body", you can completely get rid of the smoking addiction without any pain in the short term. For example, Mr. Hu Jiahe recently had a six-year smoking addiction. After quitting with this method, his weight has increased greatly.</p>

<p>Adaptive Therapy for Orchitis</p>
<p>Gonorrheal orchitis is very common in gonorrhea patients, but it is also the most likely to be destructively functional. Therefore, we must treat gonorrheal orchitis thoroughly as early as possible. What is the most likely to be destructively functional? Because the testicles produce sperm, which is the element for reproduction. This element must be absolutely healthy and pure before it meets the conditions for reproduction. However, due to the relationship of gonorrhea, the gonococcal toxin enters the prostate from the anterior urethra, and then enters the vas deferens from the prostate, reaching the epididymis, and then epididymitis occurs. The testicles gradually swell, and the patient always feels pain. Severe cases will continue to develop spermatic cord inflammation. From epididymitis to the spermatic cord in the groin, it swells into a cord shape, and the pain increases day by day. The function of producing sperm is always destroyed during the course of these diseases, and the result is infertility. According to precise statistics, 35.7% of those with epididymitis are childless. Those with inflammation of both testicles account for almost 95.6% of those who are childless.</p>
<p>Based on the clinical statistics of my years, the above-mentioned gonorrheal infertility is quite accurate. However, those who can be treated in time during epididymitis can maintain their reproductive capacity. There is Mr. Jin Zifa, who lives on McGain Road, and is 31 years old. He suffered from gonorrhea at the age of 26. Later, he developed orchitis. It lingered and did not heal. The pain was unbearable, and he urinated frequently. The testicles were partially painful. Since suffering from this disease, his wife has never been pregnant. Moreover, his wife was also infected with gonorrheal leucorrhea. He begged me to treat him. He was treated with alternating long and short wave electricity. At the same time, he was given "Kelinong" to fight gonococci, reduce swelling, and relieve pain. After taking it for four weeks, the orchitis was completely cured. However, the first urination in the morning was still slightly turbid. He continued to take it for another week and it was cured. His wife's leucorrhea was also treated with "Kelinong" as an oral medicine, and "Carl Xuedishi Vaginal Tablets" as suppositories. It was also cured soon. Recently, he was pleased to have a son. The couple was extremely happy.</p>
<p>Common Sense about Tuberculosis</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Principle of Prolonged Cough Turning into Tuberculosis <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Former Professor of Nanyang Medical University, Director of Shanghai South Civilian Hospital, Physician Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>(Clinic) Sichuan Road Ningbo Road Intersection (Consultation Hours) 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM Gospel for Suspects of Tuberculosis Scientific Remedies Achieve Great Results</p>
<p>The ancient sages said: "Prevent disease before it happens", how can you bend a chimney and change to a new one? Therefore, the cough problem of the precursor symptoms of tuberculosis is the most worthy of attention.</p>
<p>If we want to bend the chimney and change to a new one, we must first understand the principle of why a prolonged cough will turn into tuberculosis. Regarding this point, Sweden's "Prevention of Lung Disease" is very clear. I will now translate it as follows:</p>
<p>"Although a cough is not necessarily tuberculosis, a cough has the magic power to cause tuberculosis. After a cold, the lungs are hit, and the organs become inflamed, and the cough becomes frequent and unremitting. Due to the continuous shock of the cough on the lungs, the lungs' resistance becomes weak, and the tubercle bacillus takes the opportunity to erode the lung tissue. In this way, it succeeds in the first stage of tuberculosis, apical catarrh. Therefore, preventing cough is actually preventing and eliminating tuberculosis. People with colds and prolonged coughs should especially keep this in mind."</p>
<p>The above is the discussion of J.M. Rieger M.D. (lung disease expert), which proves that the Chinese saying "a cold that does not get better turns into tuberculosis" is not wrong. According to recent investigations, B.L. Villemin, a reporter for the Austrian weekly newspaper, increased his visit to Dr. Joseph Bakvie, director of the New York Lung Disease Sanitarium. It is said that among the 2,600 inpatients, 2,040 were caused by prolonged colds and coughs. According to the experiment of Dr. Reichenbach of England, it proves that "Bu Fei Naer", a powerful anti-tuberculosis drug that has been promoted in various countries in recent times, contains Kresol gum oil, which is the most effective medicine for the precursor symptoms of the first stage of tuberculosis (coughing up a lot of phlegm). The New York Lung Disease Sanitarium not only uses this drug to treat dry cough, but also applies it to severe symptoms such as hemoptysis, fever, chest pain, and night sweats, with more significant effects. As for lung patients with neurasthenia, they should also take "Bu Ti Kang" for men or "Bu Nv Rong" for women as a powerful remedy.</p>
<p>Secrets to Beauty</p>
<h3 id="e209">Abundant Breasts are the Vanguard to Obtain Curvaceous Beauty <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Zhonglin, graduate of Nantong Medical University</p>
<p>The greatest condition for a woman's curvaceous beauty is abundant breasts and high buttocks. This is the standard of human beauty. It is not only the standard of human beauty, but also a very important element of lifelong happiness. Because the breasts and buttocks are developed, her puberty glands are healthy. In other words, she has the qualifications of a virtuous wife and loving mother. We often see women whose puberty glands are underdeveloped, often having irregular menstruation, headaches, insomnia, backaches, weak feet, pale faces, thin breasts, thin buttocks, heart palpitations, forgetfulness, dry hair, and wrinkles on their foreheads. Her youth has completely disappeared. What is left is only a sad mood. She has no share in all the happiness of life.</p>
<p>According to the research of Swiss gynecologist Rodriguez, women with the aforementioned symptoms are due to the underlying ovulation function. The ovaries are the aorta of the puberty glands. If this aorta is out of order, then the functions of the whole body cannot develop normally. The only treatment is to adjust the ovarian function, and the only thing that can bear this important task is "Bu Nv Rong". Major famous gynecological hospitals in Europe and the United States all unanimously use "Bu Nv Rong" as a gynecological holy medicine. It has the function of regulating ovarian function, so the diseases of breast atrophy and buttock thinning are completely cured and reach normal development. All symptoms of neurasthenia and premature aging can also be cured and youth can be restored. However, if there is leucorrhea, then you must also use "Ka's Vaginal Tablets" as a suppository. It is a formula that treats both the cause and the symptoms.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Masturbatory Neurosis that Shakes Performance <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Original Article from Des. Perte Seminales, 1933, Translated by Dr. Chen Minbo, who Studied in Japan</p>
<p>Development is Hindered, How Can One Fulfill Marital Duties After Marriage? Impotence and Premature Ejaculation are the Pain of Life That Should Be Eliminated</p>
<p>To be honest: Sexual desire is originally an instinct. When a person reaches a certain age, he naturally needs a release. However, sexual feelings can be overcome with reason. So we can say this: If a person is married, and the couple lives a proper and sweet sex life, it is appropriate—because this is the normal life of instinct. But, if it is a young person whose development is not yet complete, but thinks about seeking stimulation every day and actually practices masturbation, then he has committed a perverted debauchery, and the future misfortune will be endless!</p>
<p>The great British physiologist Earl Po said: Those who suffer from compulsive masturbation often suffer from insomnia, inability to work, and sexual neurasthenia. What is sexual weakness? The first is seminal emission. When the condition is severe, there are more than five emissions a week. Erotic dreams are prevalent, captivating the soul, and when the vas deferens is relaxed, spermatorrhea will occur further in the daytime. Sometimes, after urination, two or three drops of semen will also flow out. Once you have suffered from this disease, if there is no fundamental treatment, development will inevitably be hindered. Impotence, premature ejaculation, and difficulty in having children are inevitable consequences. According to experiments by French Dr. Frini and German youth disease expert Dr. He Gaer, "Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Pills" are the safest and most effective for seminal emission. Just like taking "Bu Ti Kang" to nourish weakness, it can also help development, and seminal emission will be cured faster.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Secrets to Curing Stomach Problems <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, who Studied in Russia</p>
<p>If You Want a Fundamental Cure, Follow the Right Path of Medicine</p>
<p>Stomach disease becomes chronic because, firstly, patients are not aware of it and think it is unimportant. Secondly, previous medical practitioners adhered to old methods and were unwilling to conduct in-depth research, so there was no way to invent drugs that treat the symptoms. As a result, the number of patients is increasing day by day, and the crisis is even greater.</p>
<p>Recently, German Dr. Maguna Meng, seeing that patients with stomach disease suffer from stomach pain, chest burning, gastrointestinal bloating, or occasional vomiting and belching with acid, prepared "Qiang Wei Jing" (Strong Stomach Essence), a sacred medicine for treating stomach problems. Because the effect is real, it is praised as the only invention of the 20th century.</p>
<p>When I was in Russia, I used "Qiang Wei Jing" to cure many serious stomach pains and indigestion. Therefore, patients with digestive disorders in that country were as if they had received amnesty and were ecstatic? However, this medicine has another characteristic, that is, because it contains Maguna Meng's nutrient salts, which are not found in other medicines, it is particularly effective for long-term weakness, stomach sluggishness, habitual constipation, excessive gas, and beriberi caused by a lack of vitamin B!</p>

<h3 id="e212">Reflections After National Day <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Fang Kewen</p>
<p>The situation in various places on this year's National Day seems to be more lively than in previous years. The encouragement and joy show a scene of universal celebration. Taking Shanghai, which I saw with my own eyes, as an example, the situation is different from previous years. In previous years, celebrations were suspended due to the severity of the national crisis. This year, arches, banquets, etc., have returned to their old appearance. Although lantern shows and the like are still not held due to strict precautions against reactionary elements taking the opportunity to cause trouble, seeing that the streets are full of "standard national flags" is enough to make you feel better.</p>
<p>However, although National Day is a widespread "flag-raising celebration," the serious national crisis still seems to be impossible to cover up. Not to mention the news of "plotting for immediate relief," just looking at Shanghai, those who are moving to avoid disaster are everywhere. The streets are full of people "walking with luggage." Look at their gloomy faces. What they tell you is panic and憂郁. It is impossible to see the "peaceful world" of National Day from their faces.</p>
<p>Some people may scoff at their timidity, self-disturbance, and inability to express joy on a happy National Day. From a certain perspective, this scoff is naturally correct, because no matter how you "avoid," if you don't eliminate the enemy, it will still follow you. Moreover, if the war unfortunately breaks out, there will not be a safe haven in this Chinese colony. However, the citizens have experienced the lessons of January 28th, and the stationing of troops across the border has become commonplace. What better way do these frightened citizens have other than "avoiding"?</p>
<p>Due to "avoiding disaster," we are even more reminded of the news published in the newspaper a few days ago (perhaps it was the newspaper on Double Ten Day?) about a young girl committing suicide by jumping into the sea. That young lady was afraid of the ravages of the ×× people, and thought that she would die sooner or later, so in the midst of "avoiding disaster," she generously jumped into the sea to preserve her "pure body." The behavior of this young lady is naturally opposed by us, and the cause of her death, in addition to the "national crisis," also has remnants of the Jianyu rebellion nesting behind it. However, because of this, we can also see that in the serious national crisis, the people are unable to be happy under the torment of real pain, and they naturally have no mood to force a smile. It is like "being slapped in the face and then smiling."</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will say that great undertakings must be completed with a happy mood. Like the current self-disturbing ordinary people who are panicked all day long, they can only disrupt their steps. In the current extraordinary period, we should calmly cope with all incidents. This is correct, but it does not mean indulging in pleasure, let alone whitewashing peace. The result of indulging in pleasure and whitewashing peace is only worse than lacking self-confidence, because lacking self-confidence at least sees the current serious situation, while indulging in pleasure and whitewashing peace only wants to cover up and evade the serious situation.</p>

<p>"Old Li, where's that handkerchief?" It was still the sweaty one asking.</p>
<p>"Why are you asking about her?"</p>
<p>"Why be stingy? Isn't it just an empty cock?"</p>
<p>It was still last night, staying at the horse inn in Dongkoujing. The daughter of the innkeeper was very pretty, her feet were so small and stylish, her eyes were dark and charming, and she even had a beautiful bun. Somehow, Old Li got his hands on her. When he left this morning, she asked Old Li when he would come again. Old Li himself didn't know when he would come here again, so the young girl cried, and Old Li took her soaked handkerchief as a souvenir!</p>
<p>The sweaty one went to sleep angrily, and Old Li also went to sleep boredly.</p>
<p>They surrounded the cargo shelves in a circle, people slept close to the shelves, and firewood was collected in the middle, burning all night. This is called "fire group" (Note 3), watched over by the brothers in turn.</p>
<p>Fatigue brought them one by one into dreamland, a sweet sleep;</p>
<p>The next day, before the sky was bright and refreshing, the lead-blue sky was hanging with residual stars, and the earth was dark and gray. They had already tied up their horses and embarked on their distant journey again.</p>
<p>Still that dark group, they were still singing happily:</p>
<p>"Going from Sichuan to Guizhou,"</p>
<p>"Seen so many young girls,"</p>
<p>Note: In the mountains of Southwest China, there are owners of thousands of tall mules and horses who hire those strong young men from declining rural areas. Those young men run east and west with those mules and horses every day, earning money for their owners. These young men are called "muleteers."</p>
<p>Note two: "Kai Shao" they call rest as kai shao.</p>

<p>— Mu Ye</p>
<p>Early in the morning, San Mazi's teahouse was already full of people. Everyone's face was so tense, looking very uncomfortable, as if everyone was angry with someone, all depressed there, motionless, without a sound. Everyone was like a piece of wood, only pairs of eyeballs, staring blankly at each other a few times, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Usually, San Mazi always squeaked and screamed. Today, he also changed his usual habits, as if it was the first day he opened a teahouse. Everything was stiff and awkward. He himself couldn't figure out why half of a spoonful of water would be poured outside the pot. He had a ghost in his stomach like everyone else. He was worried that one day ××'s plane would really fly to this village, and maybe drop a "thousand-pound" bomb specifically to bomb his small teahouse, which would be terrible!</p>
<p>"Hey, Shopkeeper Jia is here, isn't that..."</p>
<p>The bald man sitting under the window by the east wall said quietly. Judging from his expression, he tried to lower his voice as much as possible, as if he was afraid of being heard. But everyone had already focused their attention on Shopkeeper Jia of the Zhenxing Rice Store. Everyone gestured to each other with their eyes. San Mazi raised his chin at the bald man and pursed his lips.</p>
<p>In this way, under the gaze of the crowd, Shopkeeper Jia hurried in. He wiped his sweat with his sleeve, and gestured with his hand in front of his face, and said as soon as he opened his mouth:</p>
<p>"It's over, it's over,...it's damn over..."</p>
<p>Everyone had a premonition of what "it's over" meant. The bald man almost didn't cry. San Mazi's legs were shaking. He expected that the "thousand-pound" bomb was definitely unavoidable. He slowly walked over. Shopkeeper Jia was gesturing and talking:</p>
<p>"...What else is there to say? I heard that the fighting will start not today, but tomorrow, anyway, it won't be more than five days at most! This time is not like that time!...Yesterday I went to the city, the shops were all closed, and there wasn't even a ghost on the street..."</p>
<p>"Are we going to give him a hard time?" a young man asked like this.</p>
<p>"How would our family know? I think it's... Anyway, this matter is hard to say! Their troops come every day, and their warships are full of people on the harbor..."</p>
<p>"The plane is going to drop bombs - "thousand-pound" ones?" San Mazi couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Hmph, thousand-pound ones! Let me tell you, those are still the grandchildren's generation! In short! This time it will be a hundred times more powerful than last time!"</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned, and countless sighs rose in the silence. Everyone was intimidated by Shopkeeper Jia's words.</p>
<p>"Hey! Don't worry about anything else, it's important to get something to eat! Whether we fight or not, we still have to eat! I spent a lot of effort and only got five hundred shi of rice..." Shopkeeper Jia raised his voice and said to everyone: "If you want to prepare something to eat, please do it early!" Saying that, he left the small teahouse.</p>
<p>The bald man was the first to follow out in a hurry.</p>
<p>So everyone took this shocking news that the fighting would start in five</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>days to all directions of this village.</p>
<p>The next day, San Mazi really had no intention to do business anymore. Before dawn, he took down the Qingxin Teahouse sign that was hanging high. At lunchtime, he rushed to the Zhenxing Rice Store to find Shopkeeper Jia.</p>
<p>"Hey, Shopkeeper Jia, let's get a bag of rice too, so we don't have nothing to eat when we fight..."</p>
<p>"I told you to come early, didn't I? Isn't it already sold out? Just wait, I've already sent someone to the city to pick up rice. Just wait and see what happens!" Shopkeeper Jia pointed to the rice warehouse and said like this. There was a smile in his voice.</p>
<p>Five days passed quickly. It was already the morning of the seventh day. Everyone was like a rat coming out of its hole, sneaking around everywhere to inquire about news. San Mazi was the first to bump into Shopkeeper Jia:</p>
<p>"Ah, why isn't, isn't the fighting starting!"</p>
<p>Shopkeeper Jia touched his shaved chin and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Probably, probably it's a rumor...!"</p>
<h3 id="e215">Storm <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>—Mountain Walking Notes Six</p>
<p>During the half-month of mountain walking in Dalong Mountain, what we can't forget the most is the day we left Old Ma Fu's house. We felt that the journey was short, and it would only take half a day to reach the foot of the mountain. So everyone wanted to walk again and didn't want to ride horses. Moreover, our horsemanship was not very good. Maybe when going down the slope, if the horse lost its footing, we wouldn't be able to hold the reins, and there would be a danger of falling into the valley with the horse.</p>
<p>When we left Old Ma Fu's house, the sky was so clear; when the blood-red sun rushed out from behind the eastern mountain range, it used its strong light to tightly grasp this mountain road, as if it was going to steam oil out of the land piece by piece. Looking down from the mountain peak, every mountain stone was reflected by the sunlight so brightly that it was dazzling, and the valleys on both sides of the path were smoky. Because it was early morning, wisps of cool breeze could still drift down from the mountain peaks from time to time. We didn't feel any threat at all, and we sang mountain songs softly as we walked.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, we gradually reached the middle of the mountain. The sunlight gradually left us, and everything at the foot of the mountain gradually became clear. Everyone's hearts were happy. At some point, the sky suddenly changed, and dark clouds rolled over, as if a giant black hand of a demon was about to stretch out and tightly crush the mountain peak. We realized that the storm was about to come. So we quickened our pace, but the foot of the mountain was still far away from us, and the valleys on both sides seemed even more gloomy and empty. In the middle of the mountain, except for the four of us, there was no other living creature. Not only our hearts were trembling, but also the trees and mountain stones by the roadside seemed to be gradually destroyed by the wind rolling down from the mountain peaks and trembled and shrunk. In this gloomy mountainside, they were probably shivering in terror like us! The whole mountainside was caught in the grip of terror.</p>
<p>At this time, we actively wanted to find a place to hide by the roadside, but unfortunately there was not even a large mountain stone. We had no choice but to lift our weak steps and move forward. Suddenly, at the turning point in the middle of the mountain, a thatched cottage appeared near one side of the mountain. Judging by its appearance, it was a small teahouse. Outside the house, a woman who looked about twenty years old and a little girl with two braids, who was six or seven years old, stood in the middle of the road, looking anxiously at the foot of the mountain, as if waiting for someone to return.</p>
<p>We were as happy as if we had discovered a new continent, and walked up quickly. The middle-aged woman heard the footsteps and hurriedly turned around. She looked at us in surprise. Probably seeing that we were not bad people, she calmed down and asked, "Gentlemen, are you going down the mountain? The weather is bad, and the storm is coming soon. Why don't you have a cup of tea here before you go?" Saying that, she turned around again and glanced at the foot of the mountain, and then walked down to the shed and brewed a pot of tea for each of us. Then, she went to the middle of the road to look at the foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>As soon as we sat down, the storm came suddenly. They roared and wailed, carrying threats and intimidation. The valleys echoed with a booming sound, and waterfalls poured down in the valleys, as if the heavens and the earth were competing. The shed and the tables in the shed were whistling in the wind, as if heavy footsteps were passing by. We all hurried to hide in the house. The middle-aged woman took the hand of the six- or seven-year-old girl and stood at the door, complaining to us, "Gentlemen, such a strong wind and rain often blow travelers into the valley. This girl's father," she glanced at the girl who was about to cry, "He went down the mountain early in the morning to sell firewood, and he hasn't returned yet. Could something have happened?" Saying that, she sobbed softly.</p>
<p>When we heard her words, everyone looked at each other in panic. We squeezed our bodies even closer.</p>
<p>The sound of the wind and rain outside the house became stronger. We all silently prayed in our hearts that the traveler would be safe!</p>
<h3 id="e216">Camel <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Lu</p>
<p>In the early morning of the northern country, the sky is hazy, and the blue sky is boundless, covering the silent and dead earth.</p>
<p>In the hazy mist, a group of camels walked slowly, beside them a man holding a whip, holding a rope tied to the camel's nose, walking step by step, leaving a trail of hoof prints in the sand.</p>
<p>The camels' backs were loaded with bags of coal, they plodded step by step, and the bells in their necks rang as they swung.</p>
<p>The camels' sleepy eyes looked particularly depressed. In their eyes, there seemed to be shadows of dozens of generations struggling in the desert, inherited from generation to generation. In their humps, the thick manes were covered with countless winds and sands. On their thin legs, there were scars from being whipped. They seemed to be enduring a lot of grief and indignation, swaying and walking in the sand.</p>
<p>A group of camels plodded slowly beside the tall ancient city, swaying as they stepped on the rubble on the ground. They seemed to be thinking, thinking about the wild life they had lived in the desert in the past, thinking about the brutality of being whipped when they were bound, thinking about carrying many heavy things, being led by the nose by others...</p>
<p>A man, pulling the head of a leading camel, led a group of burdened camels towards the solemn city gate.</p>
<p>The sky brightened, and the sunlight of the morning glow shone through the floating clouds. The warm light shone on a group of camels, casting long shadows diagonally on the ground.</p>
<p>The camels' eyes, accustomed to the darkness, were somewhat dizzy by the sunlight. They tried their best to open their eyes wide, looking at the warm and bright light in the late autumn...</p>
<p>They were excited by the stimulation of the sunlight. The courage that had disappeared from their whole bodies surged up again. Their bodies felt warm, they raised their steps high and walked excitedly.</p>
<p>They seemed to be thinking about the exciting life in the desert, the free days, and the situation of fighting against the wind and sand... They seemed to be fascinated, and a kind of yearning was growing. They were yearning for that freedom, that sand man, that wind!...</p>
<p>The camels were struggling.</p>
<p>The camels' monkey-like heads shook, they opened their lips to bite, a burst of heat came out, and saliva flowed from their mouths. They got rid of the heavy burden on their backs, and roared stubbornly in the sunlight...</p>
<p>They bravely raised their heads and ran towards the sunlight.</p>

The painting resembles my parents. Could it be that they resemble the sages Yang Huo? I quickly ask my wife. I don't know why it's hanging in the study. Husband, if you want to know the meaning of the painting, carefully examine the inscription above. One line at a time, each line resonates with my wavering feelings. People call out for elder sister. Please ask Wu Niang to come from the inner chamber. Why is she wearing</p>

<p>Several enthusiastic theater movement comrades have come together. The Wireless Drama Society was formed, but due to the increasing decline of wireless telephone dramas, they will be abandoned by the general audience. The failure to improve the broadcasting methods and the unrealistic dubbing technology are the two major fatal injuries. The society can use the latest broadcasting methods, and hire professional dubbing talents who are fluent in Mandarin and have rich experience. Having been hired by your esteemed station, starting from the 16th of this month, we will begin broadcasting the debut masterpiece "Thunderstorm" by modern writer Cao Yu at the Zhongxi Broadcasting Station (frequency 1040). The plot is full of twists and turns, the descriptions are delicate and detailed. When performed by the China Traveling Drama Troupe, it was enthusiastically received and caused a sensation for a while. So the greatness of this play is beyond doubt.</p>
<p>Mr. Bao Mingshan, a famous harmonica expert in our country, previously accepted an invitation from the Anding Radio Station to teach and play world-famous songs on the station every Sunday. He was warmly welcomed by harmonica enthusiasts from home and abroad. Unfortunately, the station temporarily stopped broadcasting at the end of last month due to certain reasons. During this suspension period, Mr. Bao repeatedly received letters from listeners in various places requesting to continue broadcasting. Now, starting from this Sunday (the 18th), he will continue to teach and play the harmonica at the Youlian Radio Station (frequency 880) every Sunday morning from 10:30 to 11:30. At that time, please pay special attention to our beloved readers.</p>

<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I have always admired your enthusiasm for promoting the film culture industry. I think that I have a request now that you, sir, will surely convey for me!</p>
<p>Not long ago, the Soviet ambassador to China invited people from all walks of life in Shanghai to watch the Soviet military documentary "Fight for Kiev." I also went to see it at that time. Sir, when I saw the Red Army on the screen fighting bravely to defend their motherland, my almost frozen blood immediately boiled.</p>
<p>"Kiev" is a city in the Soviet Union close to Western European imperialism. It is a target for all imperialists to attack the Soviet Union. "Fight for Kiev" is a film about the Soviet Union simulating an imperialist attack on "Kiev" and the Red Army rising up to resist. The entire film shows that the only way for a country to be invaded is to resist, because only resistance can defend the territory.</p>
<p>In the eyes of X imperialism, China is full of "Kievs." Under their threats and temptations, China's "Kievs" have been lost one after another. But there are still many "Kievs" left. X imperialism's insatiable ambition will naturally have to attack. For our own survival and the survival of the country, how can we keep the "Kievs" that have not been lost, or how can we take back the "Kievs" that have already been lost from the hands of X imperialism? I think that what "Fight for Kiev" tells us is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>China has reached a critical juncture of survival and death. We will launch all forces that can resist X and save the country. The cultural world and the literary and artistic world have all taken on extraordinary responsibilities. Film, this weapon of propaganda, we naturally cannot fail to use it. Then, we have reason to demand that "Fight for Kiev," which can promote the unity of the masses to resist war, be shown publicly.</p>
<p>I hope that you, sir, will publish this letter in the newspaper. I hope that the Shanghai Grand Theater, which specializes in showing Soviet films, can find a way to show "Fight for Kiev" in a short period of time. I think that there are more people who have such expectations than just me!</p>
<p>Wishing you peace!</p>

<h3 id="e224">The Successful Struggle of German Industrial Giant Bosch Over Fifty Years <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>The German city of Wu-tun-bao has beautiful scenery. The mountains and rivers are picturesque. It is difficult to count the great figures from all walks of life who have been produced there throughout history. If one must briefly mention their names, they are Schiller, Zeppelin, and Daimler. Since Wu-tun-bao is blessed with the spirit of its mountains and rivers, and produces outstanding people, it is not surprising that the name of a farmer's son by the Swabian River changed in the late nineteenth century into a household name. However, the reason why this farmer's son achieved such a great reputation was not due to any unprecedented invention or any great achievement. The only reason was that the goods he sold to the world were all outstanding and of the highest quality. This is truly remarkable. Who is this farmer's son? It is Robert Bosch, who is known throughout the world. Bosch was born seventy-five years ago, on September 23, 1861, in the village of Albeck on the Swabian River. The new thoroughfare from Stuttgart to Ulm to Munich passes through Bavaria.</p>
<p>The childhood anecdotes of famous figures throughout history are almost always fascinating. But Bosch had no special traits in his youth that would indicate that he would achieve such great fame in the future. The town of Ulm, located on the banks of the picturesque and mirror-like Danube River, has a small school. It was where he studied as a child. Ulm has a famous craftsman named Meyer. He apprenticed with him and became a fine mechanic. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked as a plumber, machinist, and mechanical engineer for several years. Then he joined the Ulm Pioneer Corps and served in the military. After his discharge, he returned to his old profession. During this period, he worked as an electrical mechanic at the Escherich factory in Nuremberg, and diligently studied electrical engineering at the Stuttgart Advanced School. Then he went to the United States and was hired by the Bergmann factory as an electrical engineer. It was at this time that he became acquainted with Edison. He then left his job and was hired by the London branch of Siemens for six months. Later, in 1886, when Bosch was twenty-five years old, his workshop in Stuttgart was successfully established. There was one skilled assistant and one apprentice in the workshop, so the scale was small. However, this was the starting point of Bosch's life's work. He had a firm goal and worked diligently and consistently to achieve it. Throughout his life, he never relied on publicity, and there was no need to rely on publicity. His hard work and arduous efforts resulted in achievements that were his best advertising material.</p>
<p>Everything starts simple and ends great. Bosch's success was no different. A mechanical engineer needed an electrical igniter for a gas-powered engine. He asked Bosch to find a way to make one. So he started to make it to meet his needs. And his amazing progress and success in the industrial world began with this. When gasoline-powered engines became popular all over the world, Bosch's name also became well-known. At that time, the electrical magneto that Bosch had carefully created for this type of engine was in high demand and indispensable. So even if people didn't want Bosch's name to be known, it was impossible. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Small Cars Are Popular in Europe Due to the high price of gasoline in Europe, several types of small cars are popular this summer. One of the best is said to be the "Flying Fox 500." It is the latest model. It can travel 47 miles per gallon of gasoline. The most expensive gasoline in Europe sells for $1.16 per gallon. It is most economical to buy this new type of fuel-efficient car. Even in places where the price of gasoline is the lowest, at 40 cents or more per gallon, it is still a good deal. The new Flying Fox has a streamlined shape and sells for $700. The whole body is made of metal. It is equipped with safety glass and four-wheel hydraulic brakes. Much thought has been given to safe driving.</p>
<p>July Sales of American Cars The sales of American cars in July were very strong. Both production and sales improved. Chevrolet sold a total of 3,926 passenger cars and trucks in New York City in July, a record high. In the same month of 1935, the number was 2,542. The July sales of the Lincoln Zephyr were 1,503, the second-best sales month since the new car was launched ten months ago. Sales in April were 1,607, and sales in May were 1,500. From January 1 to August 10, the retail sales of Walters Mabe were 133,155, a record high. This is an increase of 27% over the same period last year. Studebeck sold 5,348 passenger cars and trucks in July, bringing the total sales for the first seven months of this year to 43,512, which is more than the sales for the twelve months of 1935. The sales of Cadillac LaSalle increased by 33% compared to July of last year. The retail sales of Graham in July increased by 20% compared to the same month last year.</p>
<p>Dodge's Used Car Promotion Plan Dodge, a division of Chrysler Corporation, recently announced a used car promotion plan. This plan includes both passenger cars and trucks. This plan is called "Blue Seal of Approval." Any used car that has been inspected by the dealer and guaranteed for its appearance, mechanical parts, and fairness of price will be marked with a blue seal on the car. According to Mr. Xilin, director of Dodge's used car sales department, the company's dealers sold a total of 371,237 used cars in the first seven months of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Songjiang-Songjiang-Sijing Road is Open for Passenger Transport <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Wenhai</p>
<p>The Brick-Yu Branch Line Also Opened on the 10th</p>
<p>The Songjiang-Songjiang Automobile Company was founded by Mr. Niu Yongjian and Mr. Yin Shisheng. The company has been established for five years. Passengers have praised its convenience. Four years ago, the company opened another Songjiang-Sijing Road and started construction. It has now been opened to traffic after three years. However, passengers must travel to the Xindongmen Station in Songjiang. To get to Shanghai or Sijing, you need to change cars. The original plan was to go directly from "Sijing, Qibao" to "Shanghai." Then, the distance between Songjiang and Shanghai can be shortened by one-third compared to the current route. It only takes less than an hour to get there. According to the records, Songjiang County was called Songjiang Prefecture during the Qing Dynasty. It governed the territory of seven counties. Its elegant scenery is best known for the Nine Peaks and Three Rivers. And the best of the Nine Peaks is "Yu Mountain." Farmers build houses and live around the foot of the mountain in the forests of trees, forming a small market. The shops also have "teahouses, restaurants, and grocery stores," etc. However, their scale is not large. There are no hotels. On the top of the West Mountain, there is a Catholic church. Every year in May, the church holds a grand ceremony to welcome the Virgin. At this time, Catholics from far and near come to the mountain to pray. But this road can only be accessed by water. Taking a small boat takes a lot of time. Round trips are not very convenient. Mr. Yin Shisheng, the owner of the Songjiang-Shanghai Automobile Company, for the convenience of travelers, opened a branch line at the "Brick Bridge" station in Qingxian after the opening of the Songjiang-Sijing Road (Songjiang to Sijing). It goes directly to "Yu Mountain." The road has now been opened to traffic on National Day. The timetables for the two routes are listed below for passengers' reference.</p>
