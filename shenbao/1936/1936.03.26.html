<p>雖然出版事業固負有推進文化之責者非純粹之工商業所可比擬彼出版家於其官言或廣吿之中亦罔不鄭重以推進文化爲言苟其言出於誠卽當作如下之省察印刷用之機械與紙張大多數採自外國就資財之流出以言稽諸海關統計數量不可謂不鉅然綜合是類物質供給以言按諸我國之幅員與人口印刷能力不可謂不薄在如是情况之下宜若何利用此甚薄之印刷能力以收推進文化最大之功效乎假定全國之印刷能力爲十分苟耗共五分於不甚急要之途卽於推進文化减却五分之成果如是在出版家卽爲未遂初衷而就全盤觀之其影響允非細小其决宜加省察者卽古書之是吾亟待翻印是也夫生於今之世而謂對於過去文化可以絕對絕綠苟非愚妄任何人不敢主此謬論然今日所翻印之古書或則一再重印版本已多求諸舊書肆訪諸藏書家均可立致或則徒矜罕見無裨實用化秘本爲恒品破藏家之炫耀如是而已圖書館購之耗其經常費用而閱者寥寥有餘財者購之惟以點綴書齋而終歲塵封若此翻印古書誠不可以已乎方今中小學生有選書惟艱之歎大學生之課業用書參考用書往往求之外籍一般人處此空前變動之時代羣欲取得新知以爲立身應事之資古書固非無用而允爲普遍需要者實爲特行編撰之新書乃出版家傾其大部之力量從事翻印古書甚至招致古書年之品評一若示人以無須向前瞻矚但能返顧古昔卽足以安身立命者其於推進文化豈不顯相違背耶</p>
<p>出版界不乏才智之士我人冀其認定出版事業之專責不徒以推進文化爲口頭禪而務求實踐推進文化之諾言雖曰社會環境之限制不得不顧出版事業之爲一種企業亦不容忽視然苟一念及我國薄弱可憐之印刷能力必當於可能範圍之內珍重而善用之則古書年之不能再令延續實必至之結論也</p>

<p>中國本是龐大的民族　中國雖稱漢滿蒙回藏五族共和，但就文化方面看來，除極端少數稍有宗敎及語言的差別外，實際全國已是同一語言文字，同一信仰，同一風習，所以是一個統一的大民族。就人口論，達叫萬七千五百餘萬，實佔全世界四分之一。以這樣的大民族，統治地大物博的國家，實爲世界有史以來所僅見。這是我們應該表揚的第三點。</p>
<p>綜上三端，悠久的歷史，龐大的民族，自成系統的特性文化，實爲我中國社會固有的光榮事蹟，是値得我們表揚的。我靑年人認識此固有的光榮事蹟，應如何努力，以謀發揚光大，這是第一種責任。</p>
<p>第二，對於社會的未來，負建設的貨任。靑年不僅對於社會固有的光榮事蹟，負發揚的責任；即對於社會固有的缺點，亦負矯正的責任。要矯正固有的缺點，自須採取歐美特色的文化，以適應時勢的需要。所以孫中山先生說：『恢復我一切國粹之後，還要去學歐美之所長，才可以和歐美並駕齊驅。」</p>
<p>中國自與歐美交通以來，歐美文化，源源輸入。於是社會發生急劇的變遷。中國固有的文化，在從前視爲社會唯一的標準的，近已漸漸發生動搖的現象。歐美文化，幾已貫澈國人生活的各方面。不僅我國向所缺乏的新文化，遍輸全國；即我國優良的精神文化，亦受極大的影響。長此以往，如不挽此歐化的在瀾，中國勢將全部歐化，以巷代我固有的特殊文化。我們必須知道，大凡一個國家，如不能保留其固有的特殊文化，那末國家的生命是非常危險的。因爲一國同有的特殊文化即爲其國魂之所寄託。况且我國有如此悠久的歷史，如此龐大的民族，如何可使國魂所寄託的特殊文化，受外來文化的撼動呢？固然，我們應該學歐美之所長，以補我們之所短，但同時我們應該保存我們固有的長處，使其發揚允大。這是靑年應負的責任。大槪說來，中國的長處，是在道德，哲學，藝術，文字等等。而我上面所提出的固有的特性文化，就是以固有的道德哲學爲骨幹，而成的「國魂」文化。歐美的長處，是在科學。由自然科學以產生近代機器文化；由社會科學以產生近代政治，經濟，敎育等組織文化。中國未來社會的新建設，是要以中國固有的特性文化爲骨幹，爲根本，而以歐美的科學文化，機器文化，組織文化爲枝葉，爲養料。蔣院長提倡的新生活運動，與國民經濟建設運動，正是發揚固有文化，與發展科學文化的建設運動。負此種新建設運動的中心責任者，就是我們的靑年。</p>
<p>三、靑年應有的修養</p>
<p>從上講來，靑年在社會的地位，如此的重要；靑年對於社會的責任，如此的重大；那末，應該如何修養，始可無愧於所處的地位，始能負此重大的責任呢？據我看來，第一，應該養成健全的人格，第二，應該鍛鍊健全的身體，第三，應該嫻習專門的知能。</p>
<p>第一，養成健全的人格健全的人格是一切事業的始基。偉大事業的成就，必基於健全的人格。這健全的人格，是有眞實價値的。自己旣不可以虛飾，他人亦不能毀壞，固然處　濁之世，往往因爲是非不明，正人君子，反常受他人詆毀。但是一個人果具有眞實價値的健全人格，那末，即使一時備受他人詆毀，終久有是非大明的一日。所以靑年應該養成有眞實價値的健全人格。詳細說來，一個健全的人格，至少須有八種精神。</p>
<p>自治精神　人必須有自治的精神。這種精神，就是古人所謂克己的功夫。人的一切德性，多半是從克己的功夫中陶治出來的。</p>
<p>自强精神　人必須有自强不息的精神。這種精神，使人不爲現實環境所屈服，而能向前奮鬥，人生一切的進步，都是靠這種精神得來的。</p>
<p>科學精神　人必須養成科學家的精神。科學家是最富於堅忍耐久，審愼，勇敢，以及專心致志等精神。這種精神，爲一切事業成功的原素。</p>
<p>勞動精神　人必須有刻苦耐勞的精神。人生一切的成功，未有不從勞動來的。</p>
<p>正義精神　人必須有爲正義而奮鬥的精神。正義所在，不容苟且。孟子所謂「富貴不能淫，貧賤不能移，威武不能屈。」這便是正義精神的表現。</p>
<p>團體精神　人必須有與社會團結一致的精神。因爲個人在社會中，與全社會同休戚，故必須合作互助，精誠團結，庶能促成社會的進步。但如不正常的團結，足以危害社會秩序與社會道德者，那末，爲維持正義計，便不應與之同流合汚。</p>
<p>服務精神　孫中山先生說：「人生以服務爲目的』。又說：『服務是世界新道德』。所以一般靑年應該有爲社會服務的精神，以增進人羣的福利。</p>
<p>立志——一種基本精神　立志是事　成功的基礎。人若不能立志，那末即使有了上述各種精神，還是不能成就偉大事業的。所以曾國藩說：『人生第一　有志』。</p>
<p>第二，應該鍜鍊健全的身體人必須　全的身體。身體健全，再加以人格的陶治，知能的嫻習，而後可以擔常大事。俗語說：「健全的精神，寓於健全的身體」。這句話確實趁對的。</p>
<p>第三，應　嫻習專門的知能人必須有專門的知能，而後小則可以謀一正當的職業，大則可以爲國家社會做一番大事業。至於應該嫻習何種專門的知能，那就全在自己的抉擇了。</p>
<p>靑年有了健全的身體，健全的人格，與專門的知能，然後乃能負起對於社會的責任。這種責任就是：一方面發揚吾國固有的特性文化，和光榮歷史。一方面吸收歐美特色的文化，以建設一種適應時代需要的新文化。如是乃可促成整個中國民族的復興。從前孫中山先生告同志說：「革命尚未成功，同志仍須努力」。我現在倣照這句話，敬告靑年：民族正待復興，靑年允須努力。」（完）</p>

<p>江大助救</p>
<p>兩民船舟子落水後、於水中狂呼救命、此際江大輪適經過該處、得聞呼號之聲、乃立卽停車、急放舢板下江撈救、經過種種困難、始將落水之舟子五人完全救起、其中一人因天寒入水較久、救起時已凍死、其餘四人均得救活、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信可主編</p>
<p>三，上海市經售米糧業同業公會該會創立於民國六年冬季，由前滬北滬南經售米糧公會及一部份客帮販戶共同級織。會址在閘北光復路長安路口。經售米糧者，業中稱爲賣頭，與雜糧包子經手賣買之掮客相仿。惟其組織完備，勢力偉大，業務穩固，遠非稍博微利之雜糧掮客所可比擬。該業共有五六十人，均以個人爲單位，以經售米糧產區之地域分帮別：計有常帮（常熟），錫帮（無錫），蜆帮（江陰），崑帮（崑山），溧帮（溧陽），丹帮（丹陽），澄帮（常州），蘇帮（蘇州），南帮（松江，吳江一帶（。皖帮（專營安徽來貨者）。江北帮，以及來貨不多之散帮等。往年以滬北經售公會之勢力較大，因客貨均集於閘北，而發米行亦以北市爲多；且北市之發米行均專營發米，不如南市行號多以洋米爲主要貨品。惟近年以來，北市米行衰落，滬南又有米碼頭之設立，勢力叉有移歸南市之趨勢，而經售人亦不復再分滬南滬北矣。該會昔以范和笙最具聲望，范氏故後，蔣石稚，章松濤，等諸氏略有名望。現任主席委員，即有章松濤氏。會中經費，初由各會員認捐，後乃於售米時附加微抽云。此外，尚有類似之團體，有已併入該會者，有尚屬新創者，茲略述如左：</p>
<p>一　常昭，南帮，北帮等公所在經售米糧公會成立之前，早有常昭公所，南帮公所，北帮公所，等之設立。常昭及南帮兩公所在業中頗占地位；其他尚有各地駐滬米商之團體，或稱公會，或稱公所，亦有稱聯合會。其組成分子，則不外經售人，內地米商，販戶，自買船戶，承儎船戶，以及與上述之有關係者等。以前成立者，曾經立案註册，近年組織者，均未經法定手續；蓋與同業公會之註冊條例，或有衝突之點云。</p>
<p>二　滬南運米客商聯益會　該會係臨時所組織，由販米船戶，運商，及一部份經售人集合而成。在米斛斛米輕重糾糾中，報章上時見之。當時由同里帮（即南帮）販運船戶所發起，繼則邀集他帮加入，得有力者扶助，勢遂擴大。然業中有識及怕事者，均迴避之。，因有發生某種行動，引起社會之厭惡與責難。現雖漸循正軌進行，惟因內部組織上之缺陷，故至今尚未立案。</p>
<p>三滬北運米客商聯益會該會組織與滬南聯益會相同，成立未久。蓋亦滬南聯益會促成之也，其中主持人，多經售人而少船販云。</p>
<p>四，上海市米號業同業公會該會創設已久，即由嘉穀堂米業公所改組而成。嘉穀堂成立於前淸光緒戊申年，先稱公墅，後名公所；至宜統庚戍年，叉改稱爲嘉穀堂米業商會。時南北同業入會者祗一百四十八家，民國十六年後，民衆運動勃發，該業中亦有米業商民恊會之新組織，與嘉穀堂相對立。民國十八年，經市商會飭令合併，遂改組爲上海市米號業同業公會。會址在新開河丹鳳街，南北兩市各設分會，現任主席委員爲陸文韶氏，有會員一千家左右，已六七倍於前矣。該會在市內各同業公會中占有重要地位，蓋以會員衆多，而攸關民食故也。米號業之嘉穀堂與米行業之仁穀堂，各有組織，並不相混，業外人目之爲一，實則不然。所謂米號，乃門市零售而用升斗者；米行爲批發業，躉進躉出，使用斛子，向政府領有牙行部帖，直接向各路產地貨主購貨，加上佣金，轉售與米號。米號則不能向客帮等直接躉批，亦須與行商說妥，繳納相當佣金，方可實行。此即米號與米行之重大區別。惟行商中，間有兼營門市另售者，而號商中亦有兼營躉數批發者；蓋均同時加人上述二同業公會爲會員者云。</p>
<p>二。麵粉麩皮業之商　團組織</p>
<p>一，上海市麵粉廠同業公會該會成立於遜淸來葉，原名上海機器麵粉公司公會，所以有機器字樣者，以當時尚多舊式磨坊，用以區別，即廠商亦有機製麵粉公司之名稱，會員除上海全體廠家外，無錫各廠亦附屬於該會，最盛時，共有會員三十家以上，惟最近則僅有福新，阜豐，華豐，申大，與無錫之茂新，九豐，等廠而已。裕通祥新二廠，早經由阜豐承租接辦，華豐停業已久，目下正在微求接辦中。信大自去年停業後，現經阜豐承租，加早記經營之。中華亦於去秋收歇，與信大曾經租辨之信記（立大）廠，迄今尚無人接手經營。故目下該會會員已不過二十家矣。會址在民國路新開河，主席委員爲榮宗敬氏。該會曾與米糧行商合組一辦麥公會，並在內地設立分會，惟近日會務似在暫停狀態中。</p>
<p>二，蘇浙院內地麵粉廠業同業公會　該會簡稱內地麵粉公會，創立於民國元年，由江蘇浙江安徽三省內地廠家所組織，會址在白克路，現任主席委員爲蔡兼三氏，內地廠家資力與產量之不及滬廠，無可諱言，且散處各方，不易連絡，其地位不及滬廠同業公會之重要，即公會之組織與辦事，亦均不及滬會之健全：然內地各廠則多維護之，其中較爲著名之各廠，如南京之大同揚子，蚌埠之寶興，信豐，徐州之寶興，燕湖之益新，常州之恒豐等廠，均有一度或數度之改組。</p>
<p>三，上海麵粉交易所經濟人公會　該會為麵粉交易所組織中之一部份。該所正式開幕於民國九年一月十一日，麵粉經紀人之定額爲五十五，不得隨意增减，對於資格方面，限制綦嚴，須經所中呈報實業部核准後，始得更動。經紀人公會之宗旨，一方面在謀全體經紀人業務之推進，一方面在輔助交易全部之發展。初採會長制，後改爲委員制，楊錦臣朱鑑生兩氏惟該會正副主席。</p>
<p>上海麵粉教育所之職員，前會組織上海麵粉交易所所員同人會，此乃類於職工會之性質，專以聯絡感情及互助保障爲宗旨，　與營業上之集團不同。旋該會內部發生糾紛，自動解散。</p>
<p>四，上海市麩皮業同業公會　該會前稱麩皮公會，並非製造廠家及牙行之集團，乃係經售人性質之麩菜掮客所組織。昔年組織時，以個人爲單位，由沈春江翁効庭及已故之在明甫等十餘人所發起；其後逐步擴充，並由個人單位而改爲字號。荳米雜糧行號之兼營麩皮者亦多加入。麵粉字號及雜糧麵粉二交易所之經紀人亦有參加。故其勢力頗爲雄原。且該業掮客與別業掮客不同，大多均資產充實，營業廣大。共內部組織，與行號相似，祇當初以個人出面，故即以姓名改作商號。又以其行業之不同，而分爲兩派：一則專營東洋莊，一則專營內地貨；惟多數則係二則兼營者云。總會地址在荳市街棉陽里，分事務所設在上海麵粉交易所內。前主席委員沈春江氏，於今春去世，繼由同業推選翁効庭氏主持之。（未完）</p>

<p>二·校舍一瞥</p>
<p>在富有國際性的上海環境中該校校舍的各部建築却能表現美國學校建築的色彩，校舍的四週滿佈綠茵的草地，內部的設備多屬富麗堂皇，頗能引起參觀者的美感。</p>
<p>辦公室　辦公室朝貝當路，是全校最大的建築，第一層是各部辦公室，小學一部份的敎室與木工敎室，第二層是中學敎室，大禮堂，圖書室，以及化學，物理，家事實騐室。第三層雖有幾個敎室，但是多半是作爲學生課外活動的辦公處，如學生出版處，女童子軍團部，學生體育部，學生自治會等。</p>
<p>小學校舍　在學校的東北角，有一所校舍是專爲小學年幼的兒童。裏面有幼稚園與一年級的敎室，外面有遊戲場與兩操塲爲年幼兒童遊戲之用。</p>
<p>宿舍　宿舍有男女生二處。男生宿舍是在一九三三年一月完成的，內分二部，一部爲初中學生，一部爲高中學生。宿舍第一層是有家眷敎師的住室，並有敎師的會客室。女生宿舍的第一層是作病房，體格檢查室，和診療所的用途。</p>
<p>飯廳與音樂室這座建築的第一層有音樂室，鋼琴室和練習室，都用實牆和雙玻璃門隔開，並有學生交誼室，洗衣室與儲藏室。第二層是學生飯廳，廚房，與敎師飯廳等。</p>
<p>健身房與雨操場健身房內有籃球房，男女生蓮篷浴室，更衣室以及體育指導辦公室。另有雨操場一所，是在一九三三年九月建築的。雨操場建築新穎，朝北有牆，其他三面通風，頗合戶外活動的原則。</p>
<p>運動場　校中場地寬大，各種運動場地，如足球場，棍球場，網球場，都設備齊全。最近又完成了一個的四分之一英里長的新跑道，可算是在中國學校中最好的跑道。</p>
<p>其他建築水汀間是位在飯廳後面，供給全校水汀熱氣。尚有衣帽間，厠所，水塔，抽水間，自由車寄存間，水匠室，校工寢室，校園指導室，門房等分散在校舍各處。</p>
<p>行政組織　該校行政權根據學校法則係集中在校長身上，全校校務均由校長負責。但據該校校長一再切實聲明，他雖然有獨斷的權限；然而他却根據民主的精神來行使他的權限。在組織方面，校長之下設有註册主任，事務主任，分部視導員及男女宿舍舍監，襄助校長處理校務。註冊主任與我國學校敎務主任相似；同時兼理較小的訓導事項。事務主任管理全校整潔，購置與膳宿等事項，分部視導員襄助校長視導敎學。男女宿舍舍監負責指導男女宿舍寄宿生並處理宿舍中發生事項。全校敎職員每月舉行會議一决。敎職員會並非行政會議的性質，乃是研究會議的性質，是全體敎職員討論敎學問題及交換研究心得的會議。其他各種委員會集會不定期；所建議的事項均須經過校長的核准後方可施行。</p>
<p>經費收支情形該校本年度預算爲三十萬元。收入方面，全年學膳雜費的二十五萬元，佔全部收入六分之五。，因此該校學生所繳學費爲數頗鉅；詳細數目各級學生不同，且日校學生與寄宿生所繳數額亦有差別。尚有其他五萬元，則由駐滬美國社團及僑民自由捐助。該校本學期有學生的五百人，代表三百七十個家庭；假定全年有學生的一千人，代表七百四十個家庭，則每生每年所耗之敎育費平均的三百元，每個家庭每年平均爲其子弟所負擔的敎育費的四百元。但據該校校長報告，實際上每生每年之平均敎育費及每個家庭每年平均爲其子弟負擔的敎育費並未到如此鉅大的數目；因爲在全年總支出之三十萬元數額中有一部份是寄宿生的膳宿費，是不應計算在敎育費之內的。支出方面，除寄宿生的膳宿費外，敎職員薪金的佔其餘總支出百分之七十。其餘經常費及設備費均經按照預算支出。</p>

<p>許承基　六…三　六…三　六…一　卡遜</p>
<p>雙方表演</p>
<p>因時非網球季節、疏於練習、故兩人似均非在原然之中、允以卡遜爲甚、第一盤變方俱隨意打來、極少精彩、出球亦不如平日之穩、第二盤開始、許承基漸入佳境、小許之妙球、開始在拍下出演、卡遜亦竭力追隨、但每心與頤違、第三盤爲最情彩之處、許之正手對角重抽、時見特效、且時時聲東擊西、卡遜顧此失彼、昨日裁判員時有錯誤、亦使兩人减少若干興趣也、</p>
<p>比賽情形</p>
<p>開賽後、許承基出手順利、卡遜極力掙扎、數成平局、終被卡遜以八對六先獲首局、嗣許氏扳回一局、卡遜再勝第二局、至第四局時卡遜頓形得手、以滑叫獲勝、第六局輪至許氏發球、即照樣奉還、此後雙方競爭甚烈、許連獲兩局、結果以六比三勝第一盤、决盤卡遜仍先勝第局、許追成平手，並以滑四勝第三局、於雙方各得二局後、許連抽帶壓、瞬即以六比三結束第二盤、第三盤開始、卡遜已現疲態、而許氏則愈戰愈勇、攔網高壓與對角長抽、使卡遜疲於奔命、卡遜除獲得第二局外、全盤爲許氏所操縱、許一帆風順、連獲五局、以六比一再勝、至此許氏已連勝二盤、雙方握手停戰、</p>
<p>今午出國　許氏定今午十一時搭意郵維多利亞輪離滬出國、該輪泊於招商第三碼頭、此决同行者有自費赴法之林寶華夫婦，至蔡惠泉已於前日返港、料理私事、候許等過港時、同輪赴法、另一台盃選手鄭兆佳、則直接由美橫渡大西洋、在法國與許氏會合云、</p>

<p>— 賀光</p>
<p>我們提起鄭成功，就不得不先說說鄭芝龍。因爲假使沒有這樣一個精明强幹的父親來訓練他，培植他，恐怕鄭成功也不是現在我們要提到的鄭成功。</p>
<p>鄭芝龍原來是一個海盜。爲人仗義疏財，急公好義。所以和一般海盜大不相同。</p>
<p>他結交了好些道義朋友，在福建一帶海面搶刦。後來聲勢漸漸的大了，官軍也奈何他不得。明朝也知道這條好漢是不能以力屈服的。便改用柔和手段招撫了他。呌他做福建的總兵。</p>
<p>鄭芝龍旣做總兵，便着手整理海上治安。可是那時臺灣被紅毛人－就是現在的荷蘭人－佔據。中國的海盜就跑去求他們保護。所以沒法肅淸。鄭芝龍見這情形氣得了不得，便馬上調齊海軍，親自指揮着。浩浩蕩蕩的發向臺灣，去打紅毛人。</p>
<p>等到上陣的時候，他的兵士莫不以一當百，奮勇直前。可是紅毛人的軍械非常厲害：盡是些大砲火槍之類的東西。明兵那里見過這個，早着了慌。自相踐踏，陣勢大亂。紅毛人乘機猛攻。把鄭芝龍打得大敗。他祇好逃回福建。</p>
<p>鄭芝龍每提起這决敗仗，便咬牙切齒的引爲終身恨事。他常常對他兒子說！「成功！你記着這决的失敗，將來努力報仇」！</p>
<p>鄭成功雖然是個小孩子，可是他明白父親的意思。立志報仇。</p>
<p>等他長大了，果然比父親更勇敢；而且足智多謀。於是便率兵去打臺灣。任那紅毛人的大砲多麼凶猛，他一點也不怕，身先士卒的衝上去。那些兵丁見大帥尚且這般不顧性命，那個還敢後退？全像猛虎一般的殺上前去。到了近前，那大砲便同廢物了。一陣肉搏大戰，把紅毛人殺得落花流水，抱頭鼠竄而去。－這都是鄭成功後來的偉績。現在且讓我們述一述他明末愛國的經過吧！</p>
<p>當明末的時侯，天下大亂，盜賊　起。李自成從陜西殺到北京。崇禎帝吊死在煤山。吳三桂因李自成的部將劉宗敏搶了他的愛妾，便請淸兵來平定李自成。可是亂平以後，淸兵却不肯退去。把明朝江山完全佔領。於是全中國人都做了亡國之民。但是人心不死，就紛紛起來立明朝的後裔，爲皇帝：在福建的有唐王。在南京的有福王。在浙江的有魯王。最痛心是他們自己不能聯合，反到互爭王位。因此被滿淸用各個擊破的戰略，完全滅掉了。</p>
<p>那時鄭芝龍就在唐王的部下。唐王大敗後，他被淸兵擄走，幽囚在北京。鄭成功眼見這種亡國的慘狀，心里好不難過。他立誓要恢復明朝。</p>
<p>他招集了許多人馬，佔據沿海一帶。預備做興兵北伐的基礎。</p>
<p>鄭成功鑒於以前的許多敗仗，就是因爲軍隊缺乏訓練，和紀律不嚴。所以他便積極的訓練海陸軍。得功夫就對兵士演說一些國家大義，呌他們知道國家不是皇帝的；而是國民大家的，人人應負起救國家責任。因此他的兵士，全都愛國，愛民。又加賞罰分明，部下沒有一個不順他的。眞稱得起兵强將勇。</p>
<p>他自稱忠伯招討大將軍。佔據厦門，改稱思明州，招討大將軍的行轅就設在這里。</p>
<p>那時明朝的後裔，佔了廣西。稱爲桂王。成功更和他聯合，聲勢愈發大了。四海豪傑，聞風來歸的不可勝數。鄭成功見根基已固，遂興兵北伐。</p>
<p>這時候淸廷大局已定，正在論功行賞。所以一點準備也沒有。鄭成功用迅雷不及掩耳的手段，由福建直趨浙江。如入無人之境。不多日，已追至江蘇境內。下瓜州，破蘇州，直搗鎭江。所向一無敵。</p>
<p>鄭成功經過這幾次大戰，知道淸兵騎隊特多，若用步兵和他對敵，多少有些不利。他便想了一個法子：特別訓練了一隊兵士，呌他們穿了鐵製的衣服，拿着短刀，伏在地下，專砍騎兵的馬腿　。這個戰略一出，淸兵簡直無法應付，莫不望影而逃。因此鄭成功一帆順風的來到鎮江。</p>
<p>鎭江是長江南岸的重鎭。牠的西邊便是南京。鄭成功佔鎭江後，便移師西向，圍了南京。南京一下，則渡江北上，長驅直入，那怕他不勢如破竹呢？</p>
<p>這天鄭成功正在豫備攻城的時候，忽然來了一個使者樣的人，對他說：「元帥！我們打早就想投降您；不過我們的家眷在北京，恐怕受了連累。假使一個月後再降，就沒多大干係了。元帥肯答應我們嗎」？成功正在躊躇，他的將官全都說：「南京已像釜底之魚，難道他還跑了不成？元師就答應了他吧」！成功原是個寬宏大量的人，聽了這些話，就慨然的答應了。那里知道這是他們的緩兵之計呢！</p>
<p>轉眼就是一個月的工夫。第廿九這天，鄭成功發下羊羔美酒，大犒士卒。預備明天進城。</p>
<p>晚上，兵士們全喝得醉薰薰的，回營安息了。那知禍事便在這時降臨了呢</p>
<p>原來援軍已到，早和城內的定好了，裏外夾攻。等鄭軍從睡夢中驚醒，那里還有抵抗的能力？四散奔逃，狼狽得不成樣子了。</p>
<p>鄭成功傷心的了不得。好幾年的心血計劃，只因一時粗心大意，一旦盡廢。這樣的功績幾時才能再恢復過來？他怎麼會不傷心難過呢？</p>
<p>可是他畢竟是個意志堅强的人，一點也不灰心。退到厦門後，就把殘軍整理了一番：淘汰老弱，補充壯丁。東渡台灣海峽。驅走紅毛人，佔據台灣。一者做海外根據地。二者替他父親雪了那一敗之辱，償了他的宿願。－至於他打紅毛人的事情，前面已經說過，此處不必再提。</p>
<p>鄭成功自佔台灣後，振興實業，開發礦產，創辦敎育，不上幾年工夫就治理得兵强民富。可是他恢復明朝的心，沒有一時忘掉。然而那時滿洲的勢力愈發興盛起來，又加以他手下的將官，暗地投降滿淸：因此成功不但不能攻擊淸朝，反而將受淸朝的攻擊。話雖如此，但成功深溝高壘，淸兵也只得望洋興嘆罷了！</p>
<p>鄭成功依舊用着明朝的年號。可惜他不久便溘然長逝了！後來傳至他的孫子鄭克爽才被滿淸滅掉。這時離開明朝亡國已經三十多年了。</p>
<h3 id="c194">巴斯脫Louis　Pasteur（1822-1895） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭侃</p>
<p>十九世紀初期，法國有一位中年的製革匠，常常自己一個人躱在暗裹嘆氣。有一天，他給一個慈善的老人發覺了。老人看見他衣衫襤褸，以爲他一定爲着貧窮發愁，有心解囊助他，很誠懇地問他道：「朋友請你恕我唐突，你有什麼困難？能讓我帮助你嗎？」他聽見老人的話，忙起來很恭敬的對老人鞠一個躬，臉紅紅的半天說不出話來。老人看出他是一個老實人，以爲他一定有不可告訴人的苦衷，更加憐惜他，對他說道：「朋友，你只管告訴我你所需要的數目就得啦。」他知道老人誤會了，只得把實在的理由說出來道：「先生，謝謝你！我離然窮，但我不想錢。我是恨我年長失學，太不中用了！我在這裏納悶，因爲我想找讀書的機會找不到呢。」老人看見他這樣好學，非常起敬，就答應自己來敎他。他拜了老人做老師，從此不再嘆氣了。他天未亮使起來製革，趁早把工作做完到老人家裏念書去。他常常念書到了夜深還不肯回來，晚飯多數是忘記吃了。他這樣用功，當然進步得很快，不上一年，他便能不靠老師而自修了。</p>
<p>那時他住在阿波愛（Arblis）已經是四個孩子的父親了。他的工錢收入得很少，一家六口，過着很苦的日子。和他同境遇的工人，小孩都送到工塲去當童工，有人勸他也這樣幹，他推辭道：「我相信我是一個有用的人，可惜不學無術，就這樣誤了一生。我怎忍再誤我的兒女呢？我寗可吃一頓，餓一頓，也要讓他們上學去。」他眞的吃一頓餓一頓，省出錢來，送兒女上學交學費。他還在百忙中抽出工夫，把自己所認識的字都敎授他們。因爲他的苦心，結果把他的第四個兒子，巴斯脫路伊斯，造就成十九世紀最偉大的一個科學家。別的科學家大都只能給人類以便利，但他的發明是救了整個人類的生命。</p>
<p>巴斯脫是個很有志氣的孩子，他看見父親這樣辛苦送他去念書，非常感激，立志做個大人物來報答他的父親，因此他特別的用功，在校裏他是個著名的好學生。一八四三年，巴斯脫已經是一個二十一歲了，一天，他對父親說道：「爹，你老人家辛苦了幾十年，爲兒的如今長大了，該替爹分些負担，不該儘讓爹做工，兒子讀書，不久，他就考入巴黎的師範學校，半工半讀。他的父親怕他過勞，常常寫信勸他道：「兒呀，大器往往是晚成的，你不要焦急，太用功害了身子。每天你要睡足，不要忘了運動：因爲有了健全的身體，才能幹偉大的事業呵。」</p>
<p>巴斯脫聽父親的話，注意健康與修養。他曉得在考塲裏和人競爭分數，是有害無益的。他不管這一套，專心在研究室裏做科學實騐，他很忍耐精細，用長時間一步一步借試騐來證實眞理，許多急功淺見的同學，都笑他沒用，替他取一個綽號呌個「試騐室的柱。」只有他的朋友沙布（Chappuis）懂得他，沙布常常對那些譏笑巴斯脫的人說道：「你們是有眼無珠的，你們將來會知道巴斯脫是什麼樣的人。」</p>
<p>巴斯脫不管人家讚他也好，駡他也好，只知埋頭苦幹。他很喜歡研究結晶學，漸漸試騐出道理來了。一八四八年，公共敎育部長薦他到斯屆拉斯堡Strasburg當化學敎授。他在那裏認識一位愛好科學的女士，就在這一年和她結婚。結婚後，他問他的太太道：「愛，我們該到那裏去渡蜜月呢？」太太很誠懇的答道：、「還有什麼地方比試騐室更適宜呢！」她輕輕吻着巴斯脫的額角，眼裏含着幾分羞意，低聲說道：「愛，我最愛看你在試騐室工作時的樣子。」她閉着眼睛，一面追憶，一面接着說道，「臉上充滿熱誠，雙眼閃閃發亮，正正經經對着面前的結晶體，無論精細的試騐，或者深沉的考慮，都能看出你心中深處的愉快來。……還有，但不一是言語可能形容了。愛，總之你在一試騐室裏，好像魚在深淵一樣，又是快一樂，又是美麗！」</p>
<p>巴斯脫得到太太的鼓勵，更加努力，把蜜月旅行的光陰，都消磨在試騐室裏了。現在他的工作，一天一天的有驚人的成績，越發放不下手，索性夜以繼日來試騐了。有時他太晚回來，看見秉一燭久待的妻子，有些過意不去，笑着安一慰她道：「愛，我馬上就有空前的偉大一發明。請你暫時忍耐，我快能使你聞名一於世呢。」果然不久，他因爲研究釀酒一成功，法國政府賞賜他尊榮的勵位，又一委他做黎爾（Lille）科學會的敎授兼敎務一長。</p>
<p>那時全世界都相信「物必先腐也，然後蟲生之，」誰也不懂得防範外來的微生物，因此病菌隨處滋生，不知枉死了多多少少。甚至當代的科學家，汝昂（Rouen）博物院院長，包謝（Pouchet），也相信微生物是由死的物質，變成活的，是在人造空氣和氧氣裏自然發生的。可是巴斯脫研究酵母時，已經看出這「自生說」是錯了。他主張「物必先有蟲（卽微生物）也，然後腐。」他相信空氣裏一定有不少使物質腐化的微生物。於是他費盡心機，要做一個試騐來推翻這「自生說」。、</p>
<p>他趁着假期有空的時候，拿幾十個瓶子，每個封藏着容易腐爛的物質。把牠們分組放在不同的地域裏，過了幾天，他把那些瓶子收回來，他發現，在他的老家鄰近的山路上放着的二十個瓶子；打開時，有八個腐化了；在山上放着的二十個瓶子，有五個腐化了；在冰海上放着的二十個瓶子，只有一個腐化了；在滿着人的講堂裏放着的二十個瓶子，統通都腐化了。後來他又做一個試騐，拿兩個瓶子載着易腐化的流質，用高熱殺死流質裏和瓶裹的微生物，然後開着瓶口，讓空氣入瓶去，結果到了第二天，一個瓶的流質腐化了，一個瓶的流質像新鮮時一樣。原來那不腐的瓶子，在未燒熱以前，巴斯脫設法把瓶頭彎下了使空氣能進瓶裏，微生物則及瓶頸而止。未有微生物作怪，所以裏面的流質沒有壞。他反覆試騐，百試不爽，大家才相信使物質腐爛的確是一種微牛物——病菌；把牠隔絕，物質便不會腐爛了</p>
<p>他利用他的新發明，證明病菌會侵入人身的有生組織（Living　tissue），所以施行外科手術要絕對淸潔，應用器械也要消毒。他根據他的原理，又發明種痘法。等到巴斯脫的病菌學說通行後，西洋的醫學才有長足的進步，世界枉死的人數也大大减少了。</p>
<p>那時法國的工業，正在一落千丈的時候，忽然，得到復興，全賴巴斯脫釀酒法和蠶病預防法的發明。赫胥黎說：「巴斯脫一種發明之所得，够補償一八七一年普法戰爭的賠欵五千兆法郞有餘。」</p>
<p>巴斯脫的父親得享上壽，他親眼看兒子一件一件大發明的成功。平常兒子在做試騐研究的時侯，他也跟兒子學，因此他的學識也與年俱增，到了老年，他不但能懂得兒子的學問，並且他自己也成爲一個學者了。</p>

<p>— 則夫</p>
<p>「普及敎育」的呼聲已經有數十年了，然而直到現在爲止，中國敎育之不普及也依然如故。唯其高唱普及敎育而敎育仍不普及，於是一般聰明太過度的人們，便懷疑到中國文字之太艱深，於是始有簡體字之提倡，繼有拉丁化之宣傳。在表面上講，提偶簡體字或拉丁化的人們，也許有其一部份理由，而且目前少數的定期刊物上，已有在應用這簡體字了，但是以作者個人而論，說也慚愧，簡體字竟認識不了幾個，閱讀時反而發生了相當的障礙，因此我常常發生這樣的感想：在受過高等敎育的人們，當然並不困亂，祇須把簡體字表看過幾通就可以記得了，不過，一個字而必須懂得兩種寫法，也不無「庸人自擾」之感。在初識字的人們，那就要發生許多的問題，第一，倘僅讀簡體字，那麼連簡體字的字典也沒有，要查一個字，豈非難如登犬？第二，粗識字的人，假定要多讀幾種書報，祇識簡體字勢必是不够的，那麼還是要懂得原來的字體；第三，中國文字之構造，原有其一定的法則，稍涉文字學之藩籬者，莫不深悉，簡體字則不然，牠是各地商界方面的俗寫，唯其字體構造之凌亂而無一定的標準，那麼學者也就難於記憶。所以簡體字的提倡，在表面上，似可便利於普及敎育，而實際上，反增加一層困難吧了。致於漢字拉丁化那更不必說了，要知道以中國地域之大，人口之衆，言語之龐雜，而所以能在同一文化帶內孕育者，就靠了這文字的統一。現在提倡拉丁化，先要把數千年來辛苦經營的文字工作全部摧毀，而單靠拼音的拉丁文，要使全中國的人民都會寫，都能懂，這不是做夢嗎？譬如說，一位蘇州人拼成的拉丁文，常州人便不能懂，不要說杭州或南京人了。這種與其說是帮助中國普及教育，不如說是企圖滅絕中國的文化，所以作者認爲中國敎育之所以沒有普及，並不在文字工具之有問題，而在於普及敎育工作之沒有努力推進。無論怎樣一件簡單輕易的事情，不加一點心血，而希望不　吹毛之力能够成功，天下决沒有如此傳奇式的事理。掃除文盲運動亦然，喊了數十年「普及敎育」的口號，可是祇是喊，不去幹，於是在雜誌上，報章上，刋物上，盡管發了數十年的牢騷，中國的文盲還是不會掃除一個的。此次上海市識字運動委員會自從去年起，發動了識字運動以後，祇不過半年的時光，雖然還沒有看到芷式的工作報告，但據該會內部工作人員說，已經有十二萬左右的文盲掃除了。這就可以證明，普及敎育的工作不在說而在做。推進了道工作，總有辦法，總有效果，總有希望；不推進這工作，而偷乖取巧的提倡什麼簡體字，拉丁化，那麼這普及教育的工作，是永遠有希望的。</p>
<p>我們旣瞭解這識字運動的關鍵不在說而在幹，然而祇是負責識字運動的人們去幹還是不够的。要知道讀了二三個月書，識了一二千個的字，在學的時候，也許可以出人意料，成績斐然，但是一旦離校，隔了半載一年以後，恐怕還是會全部忘記而依舊變成文盲的。爲什麼呢？因爲應用的機會太少了，讀一般的報章刊物，程度還够不上，祗靠寫信或寫帳的機會，那是萬萬不行的，倘使老是讀這本識字課本，也决不會溫故而知新。也許有人要說，那麼把兒童讀物給初識字的人讀就可以了，其實，事實上也不可能，因爲兒童讀物的內容，往往順應了兒童的心理和生理編造的，給兒童閱讀的一隻故事，給成年人去讀，一定不會發生興趣。所以作者認爲在政府當局努力推准識字運動之今日，出版界方面是應該竭力予以協助的。怎樣恊助呢？以上海而論，就是給十二萬剛掃除的文盲，以一種適宜而良好的讀物，出版一種定期刋物也好，出版一套常識　書也好，總之，拿這剛掃除文盲的成年人爲對象，就他們所認識的一二千字，竭力運動，編撰各種論文故事小說等，倘使定期刋物，那麼當然可以挿入許多時事的材料。這種出版物有二種好處，在學的文盲可以當作課外讀物和補充讀物，剛畢業的可以增加閱讀的機會，而不致荒廢。</p>
<p>出版界方面倘能低兼其定價，完善其內容，那麼一方面可以恊助這識字運動，使更能收到切實的效果，同時又可獲得廣大的讀者。作者深信，上海一隅已掃除的文盲即以十二萬人計算，至少也可有一萬二千本的銷路，倘與上海市識字運動委員會合作，那麼經識字學校校長敎員的宣傳，其銷路之廣大，更非數萬册已也。</p>

<p>也該來一次整飭運動</p>
<p>說中國出版界是帶有誇大意味的，實在中國有的只是書買。</p>
<p>出版界誠然是以讀書界爲對象，可是出版界總不能像巴黎的香粉裝飾市塲，純然迎合一般摩登趣味。</p>
<p>所謂中國出版界犯着的弊病，便是讀書界並不由於出版界的誘引敎益而上進，相反地出版界郤因投合讀書界的趣味而墮落。</p>
<p>中國出版界對讀者的懷抱怎樣呢？　爲着把握了讀者一般的低級趣味，××奇俠傳××因緣之類，荒唐淫穢的小說筆記充滿着中國的出版市塲，而期刋方面十之七八是以漫畫詼諧小品爲骨幹，歷溯出版界對於讀書界的貢獻，自然以改頭換面大同小異的各級敎科書爲營利的中心，此外，七湊八扯翻印編輯一些某某叢書，某某全集，某某選集之類，弄來弄去還是這些換湯不換藥的舊東西。五四運動算介紹了一些科學的起碼知識，搬來了些近代皮毛，新文藝運動，不加選擇，亂雜雜地出了一些花花綠綠的詩歌小說，接着是社會科學運動，所貢獻的是生吞活剝一知半解馬克斯主義ABC，社會科學大綱類的書本，這還是就光明方面誇說的，至於競編一些投考試題解答，爭着翻印幾折幾扣的古書，前者旣導靑年學子以偸假苟且之方，於學術研究不願再下克苦功夫爲精湛一的研究，後者選擇旣傾向於低級趣味，印刷的惡劣，校讐的舛謬，更是不足多尚了。（未完）</p>

<p>現在德國覆文，雖未曾送達，但看近二內，希特勒所表示，和國內的言論，已可見其去題萬里也。德國首席代表李朋特洛夫，告英外相艾登，謂「德國如不能享受平等待遇，則不能接受解决萊茵問題之任何建議，」希特勒在耶恩台爾脫演說，謂「德國民族，現方要索完全自主權，無論何種觀念，苟欲橫加威脅吾人，决不甘退讓，梵爾賽條的，譬諸墓前碑碣，徒足供憑吊，不足爲世界新秩序之礎石，」二十一日德外交部某要人之談論，更是滑稽，「謂此項文件，乃以梵爾賽和的精神爲歸宿，各國政治家，昨在倫敦集議時，殆已認錯日期，以爲自身仍在十七年之前。」若照以上德國諸要入的表示，這樣的價錢，恐怕德國不肯還價，卽使還價，亦必是仰天討價，着地還錢，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>照這樣看來，這件買賣，一定生意做不成麼？不英國早知此種條件，德國决不肯接受，故英相艾登，昨又表示謂「羅卡諾方案中所開一切，不過爲四國之建議，如德國另提方案，以維持開會成立新解决前中間時期之大局，而能獲得四國同意，則未始不可以更動，」其意若日，我們的討價是這樣，你們如要還價，只要我們彀得上本錢，儘可削本賤賣，以廣招來。又二十一日倫敦各報，一致揭露英下院反對四强協定草案消息，允其關於　德國邊陲，暫由國際軍隊駐守。　英國對於軍事及政治上担負義務之規定，」由這樣看來，所謂四國成立之新方案，非但德國不會接受，就是自己，亦尚未一致，怎能可以收到一些效果。我不料所謂歐洲高明的外交家，何至不度德不量力若此，非但看不出德國的風頭，並且看不到世界的局面，日本之侵華，意國之攻阿，國際間雖曾一度作仗義執言之舉，然而不久，卽銷聲匿跡，到底無法糾正，現在德國要求平等待遇，收回自國主權，反欲拼命遏制，不特顯違公道，又悖事理，並日對德裁制，旣非易事，亦勢所不能，可見歐洲外交家的手段，亦不過如是如是而已，故我爲四國着想，惟有將已成的事實不問，已經破碎的條的不問，而重新　立一集體安全的新方案，到是必要。</p>
<h3 id="c198">風波 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>淸早，太陽高高地照在牆上，在熱鬧中顯示着一種嚴肅而恬靜的空氣。於是，小弄裏便開始熱鬧起來了；這小弄，在它底外表的簡陋上，是恰好地表現了其中二十多家住戶的地位的：店夥，車夫，小職員，秘密職業者……所有的被世界所遺忘，被都會之金色的歡笑所拋棄了的人們，擁擠地，蕪雜地，在這沒有日光浴塲與舞廳的，汚穢而簡陋的住房中，在這苦難而憂急的日子巾，天天地生活下去……</p>
<p>淸早的小弄中是熱鬧的：男人們絡續地在生活的奔忙中趕着勞動的路程。於是，女人們，聚在公共自來水旁邊，洗一點菜，洗一點衣服，談些別人的與自己的瑣事，發洩一些對生活的憤懣與憂傷：咀咒着，嘆息着……</p>
<p>小孩子們，哭喊着滿弄地奔跑，大人們縐一縐眉頭：「那種生活，那種日子！」</p>
<p>於是，有人指了指第三個後門，像洩露一件珍寶似地，對身傍的一個淘着米的老婦人說了：「你瞧，阿毛家，男的沒有了事情，整天要死要活的。昨天又哭了一夜！夫妻倆一起哭，把我們鬧得一夜沒好睡，眞是……噯，眞是…………」</p>
<p>「這年頭，過日子可不是鬧着玩的啊，耍是——」</p>
<p>突然，被指過的那個「阿毛」家的後門，像被暴風所襲擊了似的，猛地給打開了，一陣尖銳的，憂急的哭聲像箭一般地直射出來，把所有的入們底眼光全拉過來了；人們懷着一種好奇的，嘆息的心情對了那個低矮的門腔子發呆。一切的聲音也暫時的靜下去了，靜寂巾，有人低低地說：「你看，這種日子，這種……」</p>
<p>尖銳的哭聲依然向每個人底耳朵裏，心腔要直刺。接着，像瘋了一般地，年輕的「阿毛」的妻子突然從屋子衝出來了，衝撞着像一頭瘋狂的猛獸，連哭的聲調，也可怕得成了呼號了。</p>
<p>女人們走去拉住她，圍住她，也有人帶着最大的興味在探聽，像讀一本有趣的故事畫。</p>
<p>「阿毛……他吞鴉片死了！這日子……呌我……怎麼過下去呀……死了吧！死了吧！天…天……</p>
<p>「怎麼？阿毛死了嗎？」聲音是驚奇與恐怖的。</p>
<p>「要去報一報呀，是尋死的，不是玩的啊。」</p>
<p>入聲，又頓時雜亂起來了，許多人從那所矮矮的門裏走進去，爬到烏黑的擱樓上去看、死入躺在地舖上，帶着一副可怕的芥黑的臉：「眞可憐，還是年紀靑靑的入哩，這日子……</p>
<p>另一些人在安排着年靑的阿毛的妻子：勸慰着，或捐一點稀少的錢出來…</p>
<p>於是，有人去報了局，局裏來子屍車與警察，敏捷地把死屍抬了去，把活着的人呌來問了一些話，「過去的已經過去」，一切都完了……</p>
<p>響午的時候，人們又開始忙着煮飯，所有的紛擾已經平靜，這小小的風波也完全過去了，小弄裏是死沈沈地，恢復了原來的樣子。祇留着一些黑黝黝的愁慘的影子，不自覺地在一些人的心中出沒。</p>
<p>「生活是這樣可怕的啊。」</p>
<p>然而，事實上，正如一切平凡的事精一樣，幾天之後，這已經過去了的小小的風波，也漸漸地被忘懷了……</p>

<p>— 白玲</p>
<p>那是好久好久以前了，當我還在靑島的時候。有一决，我被一個婦女團體派到離。島不遠的四方的小村莊去幹了一點事情。偶然從都市衝出去，我的被煤烟窒息的鼻孔立刻浮動着一種新的感覺：春天的田野給我送來一陣噴香的黃士的氣息。</p>
<p>我沿着一條靑草茸茸的小道向前走。那時眞有些使我狂笑得說不出來的一種恬心的滋味。這雖是離都市不遠，而映在我的眼睛裏的一切，已經是另一個世界的東西了。我走進一個小村莊，我的眼睛被一些可愛的樸素的人影子佔滿了。因爲我想知道他們的生活情形，我沒有徵求得到人家的同意，我就忙亂的而且活潑的穿進一個破落的小家庭裏。門是低得非讓我灣下腰不能進去的樣子。這一家剛剛在吃中飯，吃的是：地瓜乾子煮稀飯，再就是高梁麵弄成的饃饃。他們和氣的耍我坐下，於是我滿面笑容的就一屁股坐在他們吃飯的桌旁。那家的女入看樣子是一個寡婦，家裏沒有男人，只有五個年紀不同的男孩和女孩子。其中有三個大一點的姑娘，瘦得簡直不像人樣。我曾經這麼問過那個有十五六歲的頂大的：「你姊妹們都在家裏做什麼」？</p>
<p>她小聲的說：「不。我們都在工廠裏做工」。</p>
<p>她的話已經使我再有問下去的必要，於是：</p>
<p>「你們都在一個工廠嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我在大康紗廠，是日本入開的。我兩個妹妹在英國烟草公司。」</p>
<p>「都做些什麼？」我又問。</p>
<p>「做工那有好事情做！還不是苦到家！我在紡紗間。她們在……」正想往下說她兩個妹妹異口同聲的搶着挿上嘴：「俺給人家弄碎烟」。</p>
<p>談了一些別的話，我又這麼問她：「你們工頭，是女的還是男的，厲害嗎？</p>
<p>她把嘴一撅，就道：「那是女的是一個厲害的男傢伙，那東西老欺負我們女工，他好喝酒，一喝醉了酒，就發脾氣，再不就是跑到漂亮的女工面前說壞話！我們眞聽够了！唉，有什麼法。」</p>
<p>「你們每天多少工錢？」</p>
<p>她笑了笑，現出躊躇的樣子，說：「不一樣，嗯，太少了，我每天合算起來才兩毛大洋。」</p>
<p>這時，從隔牆那家人家送過一聲急迫的女人的呼喊來：「春美姐，你吃完飯了？我們走吧。」</p>
<p>這被呌做春美的，却就是和我談話的那個女孩子。她經人一呌，趕快的站起來，用手擦了擦嘴角，笑嘻嘻的對我說：「眞對不起你呵，我們還等着去上工呢，我不能和你多說了。</p>
<p>當她慇懃地走出大門去，我便向坐在我身旁的那兩小女孩問：「你們倆呢」？</p>
<p>兩個女孩子用陰鬱的眼珠子瞧了瞧我，又瞧了瞧她嗎，但倒底沒有對我說一句話。這時，她的媽張開一張悲哀的嘴唇，微微的：「唉，她們兩個都沒有工做了。一個生病生了半月，剛下地。一個被工頭騐工騐下來了，說她年紀小，不能做什麼。</p>
<p>我的心沉重的落上一個陰影。</p>
<p>那個女人不一回又說：「這就有那個大女孩子每日能拿默錢來家養活我們。我們也指着她。這些短命的鬼，他們的爹爹早死了……</p>
<p>忽然從火門外跑進一個三十上下歲的女人來，她張着大嘴，哈哈的：「春美她媽，你們快不必再呌春美去做工吧，你不知道呀，西頭王貴的柳姐在家裏哭，從工廠剛跑回來，她說今天沒有撈着工做，呌廠子裏一個工頭騙到山上去，嗯，嗯，弄得那孩子衣服也撕破了！說是末後又呌那工頭打了，打得從嘴裏往外吐血……</p>
<p>這種野火似的消息，燃燒着我的心。</p>
<p>然而沒有幾分鐘，這個小的村莊已沉在悽慘的哭聲中了。呵，那個被工頭蹂躪過的王貴的女孩子終於犧牲在强暴的勢力的手裏頭。</p>

<p>英法比意四國簽定和平新方案，協定全文，倫敦巴黎同時公佈，該和平新方案大意，不追究德國現成事實，惟杜絕未來戰禍，譚老三曰，語云，「亡羊補牢，未爲晚也，」但是羊到底已經亡去，不過較羊亡而牢不能補，的確較勝一籌耳。</p>

<p>— 新野</p>
<p>在那條修長底砂條路上，他每天用着那枝細竹底行杖，篤篤地敲着那每一塊砂條；一步又一步地，沿着張家院子的牆跟走去。雖然，他底雙目已經失明，但這條路他是很熟稔的；不但熟稔，在這條路上舖着幾塊砂條，這里幾塊斷的，張家院子的盡頭有一條小橋，他都記得十分淸楚。</p>
<p>夏天里，天空中懸着如火一般底驕陽，晒得他底額上暴着一點一點底汗珠，一身又髒又破底衫褲上透着一陣一陣底穢氣，他却每天照例地從那條修長底砂條路上經過，走入了每一個村莊每一條巷子——</p>
<p>冬天，西北風刮着，大雪花飄着，雖然他身上祇穿得一襲人家送給他的薄薄底破棉襖，身子儘像受震底琴弦似底在西北風里打顫慄，可是他仍舊每天會從這一條修長底砂條路上經過，走入了每一個村莊，每一條巷子。</p>
<p>他是一個孤獨底盲目底歌者，在他底週遭沒有歡樂，沒有安慰，他也不會想到有所謂人生底幸福。他只像一個枯廟里底孤佾，度着凄凉而悲悽底歲月；每天，他要爲了生活而歌唱。</p>
<p>每次，當他走過了梅花橋頭，細竹底行杖敲進了百歲巷，發出了一些異樣底迴聲時，他就會拉長了那帶點幽怨而顫抖底調子，唱了起來：</p>
<p>人生是一個夢，一個灰色而短促底夢；</p>
<p>在這夢境里，我沒有見到過一些兒光明。</p>
<p>我不相信世界上有什麼幸福和懽愉，</p>
<p>只知道爭取一點淺薄底權利與功名！</p>
<p>爲了我再不願見世界汚濁，人類底醜態，</p>
<p>所以情願做一個盲目底歌者；</p>
<p>我要喊開宇宙底秘密，我要呌破人生底啞謎，</p>
<p>但是喲，春去秋來年復一年，</p>
<p>長天茫茫，大地悠悠，</p>
<p>永遠，永遠，宇宙還是閉着口……</p>
<p>歌着，唱着，他並不希望有更多底人能够瞭解這歌里說些什麼，但是他只想把一些悲哀吐在這廣漠無涯底宇宙里。</p>

<p>— 蕭雯</p>
<p>「街景」並不是車馬往回一樣簡單。</p>
<p>自從吾搬入了高樓，當然是件偶然的事，凭窗俯視，前面是一條熱鬧的街，各式樣的事情；全收入眼簾，這不是亨受，往在高樓的人，不一定是物質的主人，看到外面行人大步的跨，威到自己的靈魂像籠鳥，縱然籠子裏有好食糧，而且籠栅是閃目的金色。我不再希冀住高樓，牢獄不也是高大的屋子嗎？雖則高了，可是攀不上天堂，住了低屋子不就會入地獄的。</p>
<p>我閒望街頭的時候，已算是空閒的餘興，在重肩上偸卸一份力。每一决我默默地忖想，行人一個個走過的背影，不論年歲的長幼，一個孩子，一個有鬍鬚的，在我看來感到一樣的有陣悲傷，不是他們的，就該是吾自己的哀傷。</p>
<p>早晨，街上很淸靜，早起的有工人，學生，販者——些同運命的人，怪有精神的，不論是春天或是冬天，精神的雄豪不一定是本身的，也許爲了生活的鞭子抽在背上，像馬驢一般盲目地走條走不盡的路，前進！前進！誰說得定是「康莊大道」？學生們挾着書包的態度是貞誠的，人力車夫挾着車柄，拖着空車，沒有顧客的躑躅，是一樁空閒的憂惱，賣報者沙喉嚨戇樣地直喊：像受傷者的嗥鳴。全深印在我的眼裏，一幅勞力勞心出賣汗血的畫。</p>
<p>每一條熱鬧的街道，它具有一部社會的史料，從早晨到夜裏，從春季到冬天，演出小姐們「時裝」的進步，少爺們流行的「漂亮，女的男的，俏的蠢的，傷心的，失意的，還有從「出胎」到「出喪」的故事，這裏全流露着。我立着窗口不特看一部史書，史書裏還有多量的敎訓。</p>

<p>明月東昇</p>
<p>靜，晚上，星月異樣的皎潔。一個海港市鎮的碼頭一角，鐵鏈與木椿躺着，邊沿的大木桶像倦了的牛蹲在那裹，二個警察跟一　巡長走過來　走過來</p>
<p>他們是沿途來張貼　　，一百金鎊緝拿一個越獄要犯的佈告的。這裏是個可以脫逃的要口，也就是個張貼佈告的好地方。</p>
<p>警察打開紙包，拿出佈告來，請示他們的巡長；巡長略微遲疑了一會：「好，你貼一張吧！」就在那倘像倦了的耕牛一樣　着的木桶—貼上一紙「…髮黑，目黑。身高五尺五寸…」的　賞佈告了。</p>
<p>三個人心坎中間懷着愉悅，不，也許懷着苦痛。他們雖然明白越獄犯是一個奇才，有時候，他們痛恨着爲什麼沒有機食見見他—那個越獄的犯人啊！但是，他們的職守，把他　得緊緊的。</p>
<p>於是，三個之中的一個又得到其他的地方去貼他們的佈告。</p>
<p>靜，剩着巡長個人，他來同的踱着，星月的光把他的視綫帶到那紙紙糊未　的佈告上：「一百鎊，並且可以昇官……的迷惑在他的眼前幌動。他意識地想起「許多的誠實人，還沒有見過這樣大的數目哩！」……</p>
<p>一個黑影從左邊移過來，他知道喝住他。是一個褸人　流浪者。他一面在告訴巡長他是可憐地賣曲子的人，一面儘往前面走。</p>
<p>可不是嗎？窮人是誰都可以欺侮的。，他給巡長命令的止住了。</p>
<p>然而，他很機智，他裝傻，他沒有得到巡長的同意。他唱，……</p>
<p>「生活像泥河樣的流，</p>
<p>機器吃我們的肉！</p>
<p>煤烟燻黑我們的臉，</p>
<p>火酒燒焦了心窩。</p>
<p>……」的歌兒。</p>
<p>自然，那個是不願聽下去的，叫他住口了。</p>
<p>他——流浪者暫時地不唱，却做了個說敎者，和那個談着談着。當巡長感到他自己也是一個弱小，被命令派去做危險的差事，連「有家室」也不顧的時候，他不覺對於眼前的這個流浪人，內心嚮着同情的共鳴他又繼續唱下去，……</p>
<p>可是這歌，是暗號。</p>
<p>當二個貼佈告的警察回來的時候，巡長毫不猶豫地讓那個流浪人藏起來了。他叫着兩個警察先走。……</p>
<p>「再會吧！朋友謝謝你。你今夜對我有恩，我感激你。將來扶起弱小，打倒强權的時候，我也許以同樣的報答你……將來我們的位置都要改變的，等到明月東昇……」流浪者從木桶中走出來，向巡長揚着手走下梯階，跟着暗號去了。——從一百鎊的懸賞中脫險了。</p>
<p>巡長大聲的讀着「一百鎊，一百鎊，」的告白，醱過來似的，懷疑「我果眞像我自己所想的那樣蠢嗎？」</p>
<p>你們猜！就是懸賞一百鎊緝拿的越獄要犯呀！</p>

<p>Tianjin Japanese Ambassador Arita arrived in Tianjin by the Pinghu train at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 25th. Embassy Councilor Wakasugi, Secretary Kondo, and Consul Nishida stationed in Jinan followed. After getting off at the East Station, they went to the annex on Furong Street in the Japanese Concession to rest. Then, they separately received Chinese and Japanese journalists. At 10:00 AM, they went to the Japanese Consul's residence in the British Concession to meet with Japanese consuls from Tianjin, Jinan, Zhangjiakou, and other places to listen to reports on the situation in various regions. At 2:00 PM, he visited Tada and met with Nagami, a staff officer of the stationed army, Chief of Staff Kubota, and Naval Captain, etc. At 7:00 PM, he attended a welcome meeting for Japanese residents. He is scheduled to leave Tianjin by night train on the 26th to go east. (25th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin Arita spoke to reporters, asking when the ambassador would leave Tianjin. He replied that he was scheduled to take the train to Xinjing at 11:55 PM tomorrow night. Asked how many days he would stay in the Northeast, he replied that he planned to stay in Xinjing for one day and then return home via Korea, arriving in Tokyo on the 31st. Asked if he would take over as foreign minister after returning home, he replied that he had not yet received an order and only saw it in the newspaper. Perhaps this would happen after returning home. Asked if the ambassador had been to China before, he replied that he had been to Pingjin and other places two years ago, and had worked in Tianjin seven or eight years ago, and had traveled to various parts of China many times, all of which were of a travel nature. Asked what his impression was of meeting with key Chinese figures in Nanjing, he replied that he stayed in Nanjing for many days and met with President Jiang, Minister Zhang, and ministers of various Yuan, and had some exchanges. Asked about Sino-Japanese diplomacy, what the results of the talks in Nanjing were, and whether there was a concrete outline, he replied that in the talks with President Jiang and Minister Zhang, they exchanged views in a free manner because they wanted to adjust Sino-Japanese relations. First, China must understand the past relationship between China and Japan, Second, the general trend of the world, and Third, the situation of the League of Nations. There was no so-called formal negotiation, but rather preparation for the future. Asked whether the ambassador would report to his government based on the results of the talks in Beijing and convene a meeting to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, he replied that in the exchange of views in Nanjing, it was found that there were many points of agreement and disagreement with each other. After returning home, he will naturally report to the government. It is difficult to determine when to convene a meeting at the moment, but the exchanged views will be used as reference materials. Asked what his views were on North China's diplomacy, he replied that this matter would be discussed together when the Sino-Japanese adjustment issue is discussed in the future. Asked whether the consular conferences convened in Shanghai and Tianjin were to study Sino-Japanese issues, he replied that the gathering of consuls in Tianjin and Shanghai was not a meeting. Because after I came to China, I intended to meet with various consuls to listen to their reports on the overall situation. Due to time constraints, I could not go to various places for inspection in person, so I specifically set a date to meet. Asked according to the ambassador's intention, what path could be taken to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, he replied that this depends on the efforts of both parties. If both parties are sincere and work hard, it will be easier to improve. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin Those who attended the North China Japanese Consular Conference on the 25th included Tianjin Consul-General Kawagoe, Consul Kishi, Zhangjiakou Consul Nakane, Yuguan Consul Harada, Consul-General Nishida, Secretary Muto of the Ping Embassy, Consul Endo, Counselor Wakasugi, and Secretary Ogihara, totaling more than ten people. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin Ambassador Arita, accompanied by Third Secretary Ogihara, arrived in Tianjin via the Jinpu Railway at 7:05 this morning. Many Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians went to the station to welcome them. At 10:00 AM, he convened a North China Consular Conference at the Consul-General's residence, gathering Tianjin Consul-General Kawagoe, Secretary Muto, Zhangjiakou Consul Nakane, and others to listen to the North China situation and discuss various matters. At 3:00 PM, he met with Commander of the Garrison Army Tada. After speaking with Chinese officials and civilians tomorrow, he is scheduled to travel to Changchun via Shenyang via the Beining Railway. Ambassador Arita made the following remarks upon arriving in Tianjin: "I met with Chiang Kai-shek, Zhang Qun, and others in Nanjing and exchanged views frankly. Initially, I did not expect to reach a conclusion, but it seems that progress has been made on the foundational work of adjusting relations between the two countries. The situation in Central China and North China are different, and we must make efforts gradually and unhurriedly in future relations with China. However, depending on how those efforts are made, the future may be optimistic or pessimistic. Regarding the issue of communist bandits invading North China, we must fully listen to the actual situation and measure its development before we can discuss countermeasures. It seems too simple to say that the three principles toward China will immediately enter into concrete agreement." (25th Dentong Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin Colonel Ota, Chief of the Military Affairs Division of the Japanese Naval Ministry, arrived in Tianjin by plane from Dalian at 11:00 AM on the 25th to meet with Tada and Kubota. He brought a port development plan for North China from the central naval department to consult with relevant parties. He will go to Ping to meet with Navy Officer Kuwahara in the morning of the 26th and then return to his country. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing Foreign dispatches say that the Japanese government has internally decided that Shigemitsu will succeed as ambassador to China. The reporter inquired from relevant parties today and learned that the Japanese side has not yet submitted a request for consent to our government. It is likely that this will be formally proposed after Arita returns home and takes office as foreign minister. (25th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e9">A Word for the Publishing Industry <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Commentators on the publishing industry in the recent year or two often suggest that, following the examples of the National Products Year and the Children's Year, these years should be called the Ancient Books Year. This is because classics, histories, philosophical works, and literary collections have been reprinted in large numbers, replacing woodblock printing with new bindings, reducing bulk, and creating abridged editions. This has become a trend, seemingly the main current of the publishing industry. Calling it the Ancient Books Year is truly to speak of its actual state. To this day, this trend has not abated. The items displayed on shelves and promoted in advertisements reveal that printing presses are still largely focused on this. The Ancient Books Year may continue for three, four, or even nine or ten years.</p>
<p>Reprinting ancient books has become a common practice in the publishing industry, and there are reasons for this, not just coincidence. The Chinese people are generally poor and have little surplus to spend on books. Publishers may find that new manuscripts published at great expense become unsold inventory in warehouses. It is better to reprint ancient books, which do not require manuscript fees or copyright costs, and have a certain number of sales. This is because there are still many people today who know and want to obtain ancient books, and libraries everywhere serve as their outlets. Furthermore, the political authorities once had a system of setting up committees to review books and magazines, which was later abolished, but news of banned books still appears from time to time. Moreover, if a text touches upon a religion, that religion will rise up to protest; if it denigrates a certain country, that country will file a complaint. Publishers are already careful when publishing a new book, doing their best to read, review, and edit it, but it is still unknown whether the product will circulate safely in society and be considered pure and flawless. It is better to reprint ancient books, which, due to the distance of time, do not offend internally or externally. Their absolute safety can be guaranteed without divination. Furthermore, various industries have felt the difficulty of capital turnover in recent years, and the publishing industry has not been an exception. Reprinting sets of ancient books with advance orders is like soliciting goods from readers. Promoting them with low prices allows for quick sales. It is not as easy to estimate the value of other books, nor is it as cheap. From the above, it can be seen that publishers, considering their own interests, find reprinting ancient books as natural as water flowing downhill. The social environment also limits the publishers' decisions.</p>
<p>However, the publishing industry has the responsibility of promoting culture and cannot be compared to purely industrial and commercial enterprises. Publishers often solemnly declare the promotion of culture in their official statements or advertisements. If their words are sincere, they should reflect as follows: the machinery and paper used for printing are mostly imported from foreign countries. Judging by the outflow of wealth, the quantities recorded in customs statistics cannot be said to be small. However, considering the supply of these materials in general, and judging by the size and population of our country, our printing capacity cannot be said to be large. Under such circumstances, how should we utilize this thin printing capacity to achieve the greatest effect of promoting culture? Assuming that the national printing capacity is ten parts, if five parts are wasted on less urgent matters, the results of promoting culture will be reduced by five parts. In this case, the publisher has not fulfilled their original intention, and the impact on the whole picture is not small. The ancient books that are urgently in need of reprinting must be carefully considered. Living in the present world, no one dares to advocate the fallacy that one can be absolutely cut off from the past culture. However, the ancient books that are being reprinted today are either repeatedly reprinted, with many versions already available, easily found in second-hand bookstores and collectors' homes, or they are merely rare and of no practical use, turning secret books into common goods and shattering the collector's ostentation. Libraries purchase them at the expense of their regular expenses, but few read them. The wealthy buy them only to decorate their studies and they remain dusty all year round. Reprinting ancient books in this way cannot be allowed to continue. At present, middle and primary school students lament the difficulty of selecting books. University students often seek textbooks and reference books from foreign countries. In this era of unprecedented change, people generally want to acquire new knowledge to establish themselves and deal with matters. Ancient books are not useless, but what is generally needed is newly written books. However, publishers devote most of their efforts to reprinting ancient books, even inviting criticism for the Ancient Books Year, as if to show people that they do not need to look forward, but can live and work in peace by looking back at the past. Does this not clearly contradict the promotion of culture?</p>
<p>The publishing industry is not lacking in talent and wisdom. We hope that they will recognize their specific responsibility in the publishing industry, not just pay lip service to the promotion of culture, but strive to practice the promise of promoting culture. Although the limitations of the social environment must be considered, and the publishing industry as a type of enterprise cannot be ignored, if we think of our country's weak and pitiful printing capacity, we must cherish and make good use of it within the possible scope. Then, the conclusion that the Ancient Books Year cannot be allowed to continue is inevitable.</p>

<p>Nanjing The Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court decided to publicly hear the case of the assassination of former President Wang at the Capital District Court on the 30th. It has designated Criminal Court President Lu Wenlan, Judge Long Canya, and Wu Yuheng to form a collegiate panel, with Lu as the presiding judge.

<p>Rome: General Valle, the head of the Italian Air Force, recently declared in the Chamber of Deputies that the Italian Air Force will be rapidly strengthened and modernized. "Italy is now building a new type of aircraft capable of carrying a ton and a half of bombs, which can fly from Rome to any point in the Mediterranean in one go. It is expected to be completed by the end of May. Due to Italy's geographical location, we must control any point in the Mediterranean and not allow any sense of being out of reach." General Valle then described the current state of air force personnel training, stating that eighteen aviation schools have been established nationwide to train pilots. The air force conscription system will also be established immediately. As of yesterday, the number of aircraft squadrons has doubled, and two new air force squadrons have been formed. A new air force battalion has also been established, commanded by Prince Savoy, the king's nephew, and a fourth air defense zone has been designated. Regarding air force materials, Valle stated that the percentage of aircraft materials purchased from foreign countries has been reduced from 23% to 8%. New reconnaissance aircraft will soon be test-flown, and bombers will be completely modernized. Fuel depots have also been completed since March 1, making it possible to cope with all contingencies. General Valle concluded by saying that the aviation department has also made many facilities in East Africa, such as new airfields, with twenty-five in Italian Eritrea and fifty-four in Somaliland. Some airfields in Eritrea are located at altitudes of 2,400 meters above sea level, a great achievement. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>

The Locarno Pact negotiations have been temporarily prevented from collapsing.

(24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>London: The Council of the League of Nations held a closed-door meeting this afternoon, passing a resolution thanking the Locarno powers (Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy) for their efforts to maintain peace and expressing the opinion that while the Locarno signatory states are still in talks, the Council should suspend action. It then requested that the Locarno powers keep the Council informed of the progress of the talks at any time, before adjourning indefinitely. It was also decided that as soon as the situation is suitable for further consideration of the issues raised by the Belgian and French governments, the chairman should convene a meeting of the Council in Geneva. Dr. Dikhoff, a foreign ministry advisor, attended today's meeting as the German representative. (25th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Judging from various indications, the discussion among the Locarno signatory states regarding the Rhineland issue seems likely to be stalled until mid-May. German representative Ribbentrop will meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon to reiterate Germany's position. Ribbentrop will depart for Berlin on Friday but is expected to return to London next Tuesday with Hitler's counterproposal to the four-power memorandum. However, France will hold elections on May 3, and before the results of these elections are known, the various countries may not seriously study the German counterproposal. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini must wait until the efforts of the Spanish Prime Minister and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations regarding an Italo-Abyssinian settlement have yielded results before announcing Italy's position. Therefore, the various countries will not immediately seriously study the German counterproposal until Mussolini announces his position, which is why the discussion of the situation may be postponed until mid-May. French Minister Without Portfolio Flandin had a beneficial conversation with Eden this morning before returning to Paris, and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov will also meet with the British Foreign Secretary this afternoon.

<h3 id="e23">Content of German Reply: Rejection of Proposals Harming German Sovereignty <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London: German representative Ribbentrop arrived here by plane from Berlin at 6:00 PM tonight. After a brief rest, he went to the office of the British Foreign Secretary to deliver the "Interim Reply" drafted by the German government to British Foreign Secretary Eden. The reply is divided into four parts, rejecting all proposals in the four-power draft that harm German sovereignty and damage German honor. The first section of the reply restates the German government's conclusion that the Franco-Soviet pact conflicts with the Locarno Pact in both legal and political terms. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to seek the restoration and integrity of its sovereignty within its borders. Germany's dispatch of troops into the Rhineland is not merely to reoccupy the region but is a preliminary preparation for building peace in Europe. This act of restoring sovereignty within its own borders cannot be separated from Germany's peace plan for a moment.</p>
<p>The second section of the reply solemnly states all the preliminary necessary conditions for building peace in Europe that the German government deems necessary. European countries should conclude a permanent agreement to guarantee peace in Europe, proceeding in a spirit of mutual understanding and respect for the principle of equal sovereignty of all countries. Governments should understand that the establishment of unequal treaties is naturally considered justified from the point of view of the beneficiary, but those who are harmed will certainly regard this as a portrayal of partiality and injustice and will do their best to abolish them. It is universally acknowledged that such treaties cannot last forever. Therefore, any treaty or agreement must be based on the principle of equality, concluded by the free will and awareness of each country, in order to hope for the support or sacrifice of the governments and peoples of each country. All countries must recognize this point, and then it will be easier to start solving future events. Germany has already completed this preliminary preparation by restoring the integrity of its sovereignty within its borders.</p>
<p>The third section of the reply states that, based on the above two sections, it can be seen that all the proposals in the four-power draft cannot contribute to building peace in Europe. If the German government accepts such proposals that harm German sovereignty, it will undoubtedly be condemned by the people. The German government will certainly not do so. Historical facts have already shown us that peace built on an unstable foundation will collapse. Therefore, the German government will refuse to accept all the proposals put forward by the Locarno powers, firmly believing that unless the peoples and their leaders of all countries have a sense of unconditional and lasting security and peace, all attempts to improve international social conditions will be ineffective. The peace plan put forward by Germany is based on this feeling.</p>
<p>The fourth section of the reply states the wishes of the German government and its people, saying that although Germany has refused to accept the proposals in the draft, it still hopes that the British government can put forward other more reasonable proposals to help resolve and clarify the current chaotic situation in Europe. Germany will naturally follow suit to do its part.</p>
<p>The reply concludes with a statement that the German government will have more concrete proposals and counterproposals to explain Germany's position in detail to the British government after the general election on March 31. (24th National Telegram)</p>

<p>London: The White Paper on national defense plans, submitted by the government on the 3rd of this month, was passed by the House of Commons on the 10th of this month by a vote of 371 to 153.

(24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London: French Ambassador to Britain Corbin recently visited Foreign Secretary Eden, lodging a protest on behalf of French Foreign Minister Flandin regarding the following two matters: 1. The draft agreement established at the Locarno Conference was disclosed by Britain before it had been approved by the countries concerned. 2. Eden explained this draft agreement in the House of Commons, saying that it was of a suggestive nature. Regarding the second point, Eden replied that his explanation only meant that the part of the draft agreement concerning the proposals to Germany was not of a definite nature, while the promise that Britain had made to France and Belgium, that if future negotiations broke down, Britain would come to the aid of France and Belgium, was unchangeable. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Since the Locarno Treaty was rejected by Germany, French Minister Without Portfolio Flandin visited Foreign Secretary Eden this morning and issued a statement to him, saying that any expression of compromise that would endanger France's security in the future is not what France desires. It is unwilling to hear of Germany building defensive fortifications in the Rhineland region, which is no different from Britain's inability to recognize Germany having a base in the North Sea. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris: The French political community believes that after Germany's entry into the Rhineland, the London Agreement of March 19 remains valid between Britain, France, and Belgium. Therefore, the general staffs of these three countries can begin consultations because countries that have not abandoned the Locarno Pact are still bound by its obligations and guarantees. The London Agreement stipulates: 1. The International Court of Justice in The Hague should determine whether the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty undermines the Locarno Pact as Germany claims. 2. An demilitarized zone should be established on the German side of the Franco-German border. 3. The British, French, and Belgian general staffs should consult on plans to protect this border.

<p>Paris: Foreign Minister Flandin left for Yonne Province at 5:00 PM this afternoon to rest briefly. (Flandin will contest the general election in that province when the Chamber of Deputies holds its reelection on the 26th of next month.) He will continue to communicate with the Foreign Ministry during his absence from the capital so that he can rush back to the capital if necessary. Before his departure, Flandin paid a visit to Prime Minister Sarraut at 3:15 PM to discuss the attitude that France should adopt after Germany submitted its reply, a discussion that lasted an hour and a half. It was decided that France's attitude would not change, namely: 1. The Locarno Conference draft agreement is a whole; Germany must accept or reject it in its entirety. 2. France will not begin negotiations with Germany until this agreement is implemented. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Since the Locarno Four-Power Agreement was rejected by Germany, French figures believe that the British and Italian representatives had previously sent letters to France and Belgium, declaring the mutual assistance measures that Britain and Italy, as guarantors of the Locarno Pact, should take, and that these should now be implemented. According to official sources here, the British government has never sent such letters to France and Belgium and will not do so until the Italian government has ratified the Locarno Four-Power Agreement. They said that the urgent task is to conduct negotiations among the countries concerned. On the one hand, Britain and Germany should conduct negotiations, and on the other hand, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium should finalize the interim measures that have already been agreed upon. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Since the German government rejected all the proposals in the draft Locarno Agreement, British officials commented on the German reply, believing that Germany's willingness to submit concrete proposals on March 31 proves that it has no intention of acting rashly, and that it is still possible for the country to show compromise after the House of Commons election. Foreign Secretary Eden has notified the delegations of Belgium, France, and Italy of the contents of the reply tonight. French Minister Without Portfolio Flandin is scheduled to meet with Eden tomorrow and fly back to France that afternoon to seek instructions from his government. (24th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Hitler's Doctrine: 1.5 Million Listeners <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Berlin: Today, 20,000 people gathered in the newly completed "German Hall" in this city to listen quietly to Führer Hitler's election speech. The speech was also broadcast by radio to other gatherings with 200,000 listeners. The authorities also installed hundreds of loudspeakers on the streets and public squares of Berlin to broadcast Hitler's speech. It is estimated that the number of people gathering to listen in various places was around 1.5 million.</p>
<p>Hitler's speech began by recounting the domestic difficulties and hardships that Germany has suffered in the seventeen years since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, as well as the oppression it has endured in foreign affairs. He then explained the current foreign policy adopted by the government, the purpose of which is to seek freedom and equality among nations and the integrity of domestic sovereignty. Any country that does not want Germany to achieve this goal is not worthy of talking about peace, because they do not want peace and do not trust peace. What they need is to exploit the interests of others to satisfy their own greed. He then explained Germany's current position on the issue of building peace in Europe, saying that it is impossible to seek temporary stability on the current foundation, and that it is necessary to thoroughly promote genuine understanding among nations and seek a fair adjustment of various disputes. He does not believe that there is truly a country in the world that wants its neighbors to be in a state of oppression forever. The reason is nothing more than that general dazzling and ostentatious opportunistic politicians mix the happiness of the entire nation with their personal feelings. As for the rejection of the four-power draft proposal, Hitler also declared that what we have lost in the past, we are now doing our best to recover. I am very grateful to God for enabling me to undertake this arduous task of fighting for the entire nation, but the countries of the world should understand that it is not that I personally am dissatisfied with the proposal and refuse to accept it, but that it is the trend of the public opinion of the entire German nation. We certainly do not want Germany's honor to suffer the slightest damage. Since we do not want to interfere in the affairs of others, nor do we want others to interfere in our affairs, we will naturally reject all oppressive and insulting demands without hesitation. Hitler then said that we have already offered a plan for peace to the world, and next Tuesday we will reiterate our proposals in the most perfect and clear way, so that the people of the world can know that what they think is impossible, we are now working hard to do. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the German people will show the people of the world in the general election on March 29 that this effort of Germany has the backing of the entire nation. At the end of his speech, Hitler reiterated the main point of his entire speech in the most concise words, saying, "Germany is willing to seek genuine peace with other countries, but any request by other countries to restrict Germany's freedom is absolutely unacceptable to Germany."</p>
<p>During Hitler's speech, every passionate and moving sentence aroused applause and cheers from the general audience, like an echo, the grandeur of which was unprecedented. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Turkey Follows Germany's Lead: Demands Restoration of Sovereignty; Wants to Fortify the Dardanelles Strait <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>London: Turkey, in its capacity as a member of the Council of the League of Nations, formally notified the League of Nations today, demanding the right to fortify the Dardanelles Strait, the Bosphorus Strait, and the Sea of Marmara. These three places were previously Turkey's strategic areas before the European War. Now Turkey will abandon the annex to the Treaty of Lausanne that stipulates that Turkey will establish a demilitarized zone in the waterways for communication with Europe. The reason is that Germany has re-stationed troops in the Rhineland region, and Turkey can also follow suit and abandon the Treaty of Lausanne. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<p>London: The News Chronicle reports that since Germany abolished the Locarno Pact on the 7th of this month and dispatched troops into the Rhineland region, the situation has greatly changed. The Turkish government, in view of this, has decided to raise the issue of re-fortifying the Dardanelles Strait at any moment. Turkey has long been concerned about the Dardanelles Strait, which was stipulated by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 as not allowed to be fortified. When the Italo-Abyssinian dispute occurred, the British government contacted the countries along the Mediterranean coast in December of last year to discuss naval cooperation, and Turkey was also among them. At that time, Turkey believed that this was a rare opportunity and planned to take the opportunity to demand that the clause in the Treaty of Lausanne stipulating that the Dardanelles Strait should not be fortified be abolished. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü Aras also discussed this matter with former French Prime Minister Laval, hoping that France would support Turkey's request. Later, because Germany already had the intention to demand the re-fortification of the Rhineland, the Turkish authorities believed that it would be inappropriate to raise the issue of the Dardanelles Strait and temporarily put the matter on hold.

<p>Rome: As a result of continuous consultations among the authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary, three protocols have been signed to supplement the shortcomings of the Three-Power Agreement of March 17, 1934. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(First item) The three governments decided to establish a permanent consultation mechanism to further strengthen cooperation among their countries.</p>
<p>(Second item) The three governments mutually agree that if any signatory state of this protocol conducts political negotiations with other countries on the Danube River basin issue, it should consult with the other two signatory states in advance. Otherwise, these negotiations shall not be conducted. The three governments also agreed that the economic relations between each signatory state and other countries in the Danube River basin should be further strengthened. Although this is expected, at present, other countries in the Danube River basin may not directly join the Italo-Austro-Hungarian Three-Power Agreement, but may only conclude bilateral agreements with it in order to develop mutual economic relations.</p>
<p>(Third item) The above-mentioned permanent consultation mechanism is composed of the foreign ministers of the three countries and should meet periodically at a time deemed appropriate by the three governments. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome: According to reliable sources here, the treaty established by Italy, Austria, and Hungary has indirectly involved Czechoslovakia in the diplomatic network in Central Europe planned by Prime Minister Mussolini.

Italy also promises to strongly encourage Hungary to participate in the future coordination of the people of the Danube River region. (24th National Telegram)</p>

<p>London: Reliable sources indicate that the US Chief Delegate to the London Naval Conference, Davis, and British Foreign Secretary Eden exchanged documents today, continuing to uphold the principle of naval equality between the two countries. The significance of this statement is seen as an expression of cooperation between the US and UK amidst Japan's isolation. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>The London Naval Conference held a plenary session at 4:15 PM today in Queen Anne's Room at St. James's Palace. The chief representatives of the UK, France, and the United States signed the naval treaty. Italy, the various British Dominions, and India sent representatives to participate. Japan also sent Counselor Fujii and Naval Captain Fujita from its embassy in the UK as observers. The 1930 London Naval Conference and the recent extraordinary meeting of the 91st League of Nations Council were also held in this room, making it a place of historical significance. The room's pillars were painted white, complemented by deep red decorations, enhancing the clarity of the colors. The huge fireplace was filled with burning logs and coal smoke, creating a warm atmosphere. Paintings of George I through George III, along with many famous paintings, hung on the walls. Bright lights were suspended from the ceiling by golden chains, surrounded by forty candle-shaped electric lamps. Many wall lamps were also installed, creating a soft light. The conference table was horseshoe-shaped, with the chairman's seat in the middle, occupied by British Foreign Secretary Eden, the same seat that British Prime Minister Baldwin used during the opening of the naval conference. Seated opposite Eden, starting from the left end, were, in alphabetical order by country name, US Chief Delegate Davis, Delegate Rear Admiral Stanley, followed by representatives from Australia, Canada, France, the UK, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa. Other experts and advisors from each country sat behind the representatives in the second row. Japanese observers Fujii and Fujita sat behind the French experts. Only a few journalists were allowed to listen in the room, so microphones were placed on the conference table to transmit the speeches of each country's chief representative to the adjacent room for the majority of journalists to record. The agenda for today's meeting was divided into five items: The Chairman, British Foreign Secretary Eden, delivered a speech. The chief representatives of each country delivered speeches in alphabetical order by country name. They then signed the treaty in alphabetical order. The chief representatives of each country could express further opinions after signing. The Chairman announced the adjournment of the conference, using the phrase "the naval conference is now adjourned" rather than "closed," the same situation as at the end of the 1930 London Naval Conference, so that the naval conference would nominally remain in existence and could be reopened at any time in the future. The naval treaty signed was divided into three parts. The first part concerned the procedures for exchanging shipbuilding programs and other information among the signatory countries. The second part concerned the qualitative restrictions on various types of ships. The third part concerned safeguard clauses.

<p>Tokyo: Premier Hirota met with the foreign press corps at the Prime Minister's official residence at 4:00 PM on the 25th. In a conversational manner, he clarified the Japanese government's foreign policy as follows: "Regarding the current cabinet's domestic and foreign policies, these were announced some days ago, and I believe you are all very familiar with them. The foundation of Japan's foreign policy was made clear in the Imperial Rescript when we announced our withdrawal from the League of Nations on March 27th of Showa 8 [1933]. In short, we must first ensure the stability of East Asia, and at the same time, in the spirit of harmony among all nations, conduct friendly relations with friendly countries. We sincerely hope to contribute further to the progress of international peace and the well-being of mankind. Relations between Japan and China will also gradually deepen. Therefore, we will establish normal relations between Japan, China, and Manchukuo, and promote their cooperation and collaboration. At the same time, we will further strengthen our long-standing goodwill with the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries. We wish to fully implement our mission regarding the stability of East Asia. As for trade and economic issues, we must enhance Japan's economic needs and eliminate trade barriers and make adjustments. Therefore, in order to promote full progress in trade, we intend to work very hard." (Domei News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Premier Hirota, accompanied by Director of the Information Bureau, Amano, met with the press corps from the UK, US, France, Germany, and the Soviet Union on the 25th for forty minutes, discussing foreign and domestic policies. In addition to issuing a statement in a conversational style, the following is a record of the question-and-answer session:</p>
<p>(Press Corps Question) What is meant by independent and proactive diplomacy?</p>
<p>(Premier Hirota Answer) The so-called independence refers to exercising independent diplomacy. In the past, there has been a tendency to be slow in resolving pending issues. Therefore, in the future, we intend to work on proactive measures to resolve pending issues with various countries.</p>
<p>(Question) Regarding the importance of Japan-China relations, what policies will be adopted in the future?</p>
<p>(Answer) This remains the most important foreign policy issue. Therefore, the Japanese government intends to be extremely cautious in adjusting relations between the two countries.</p>
<p>(Question) Does the Premier still intend to promote the Three Principles for China presented at the 68th Diet as before?</p>
<p>(Answer) My speech in the Diet cannot be changed. The Three Principles are the fundamental policy for adjusting Japan-China issues, and they are not only for the benefit of Japan but also take into account the interests of friendly countries. Therefore, the policy is aimed at adjusting the interests of both sides.</p>
<p>(Question) Mr. Molotov recently told the foreign press corps in Moscow that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union have improved. What is the situation?</p>
<p>(Answer) I have seen this in news articles and I feel it is good. Japan has always worked to maintain friendly relations, but the Soviet side sometimes says that Japan-Soviet relations are dangerous, and sometimes they say they are improving. In short, this is their point of view. Japan's attitude has not changed in any way. Now that Mr. Molotov is gradually understanding Japan's attitude, it is very gratifying.</p>
<p>(Question) Was the issue of purchasing Northern Sakhalin also mentioned? (At this point, the Premier looked at Mr. Nagi, the correspondent for the Soviet TASS news agency, and replied) Mr. Nagi knows this very well, please ask him.</p>
<p>(Press Corps Question) The current cabinet is said to be implementing domestic reforms, but the road ahead is difficult.</p>
<p>(Premier Hirota Answer) This issue is extremely difficult, but it is like walking the path of life, there will inevitably be ripples. We intend to make great efforts to break down accumulated malpractices.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the content of the so-called renewal of education? Is it intended to suppress foreign ideas?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the future, we should certainly absorb foreign culture, but we must review whether it is truly suitable for the conditions in Japan. (Domei News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Finance Minister Baba held a meeting of local tax bureau, supervisory bureau, customs, and monopoly bureau chiefs at the Central Conference Hall at 9:30 AM on the 25th, expressing the following about financial policy: "The traditional financial policies have not been able to adapt to the current era, so they must be changed. In my opinion, due to the implementation of national policies, it will not be possible to reduce expenditures in the future, and state expenses are likely to expand further. Relying on a deficit bond policy is definitely not a good method. Therefore, it is necessary to revise the tax system and implement tax increases to strengthen the financial foundation. However, the method of implementation should avoid rapid changes that would damage the national economy, which is the foundation of finance. Furthermore, the tax increase plan must be carried out in conjunction with policies to promote trade and industry, in order to restore the national economic power in other areas." (Domei News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: In response to the Hirota cabinet's renewal of national policy, the naval authorities have newly established a Naval System Investigation Committee, which convened its first general meeting on the 23rd. Within this committee, three subcommittees were established for policy, institutional reform, and budget, and they have begun active investigation and research. Navy Minister Nagano convened the head of the Investigation Committee, Director General Hasegawa, Bureau Chief of Naval Affairs, Toyoda, and Bureau Chief of Accounting, Murakami, in the ministry conference room at 1:30 PM on the 25th, to instruct the members on the policy of the Investigation Committee. He stated in brief: "In light of the domestic and international situation, we must take a cautious attitude and attempt to reform the naval system. Therefore, investigation and research must be carried out meticulously, and we must strive for comprehensive plans. At the same time, concrete plans must be implemented according to their urgency." The three subcommittees, centered on the two committee chiefs Toyoda and Murakami, are first collecting basic data to establish concrete plans, and will adjust them as soon as possible, aiming to start formal activities as early as April to promote their success. (Domei News Agency, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The first conference of army commanders and division commanders since Land Minister Terauchi took office will be held at the Land Minister's official residence for five days starting on the 7th of next month. At that time, Land Minister Terauchi will explain in detail the entire picture of the 上决事伴 [likely a typo, should be 上级指示事項 Superior Instructions] and instruct on the army's highest policies for the future. Therefore, all quarters are paying close attention. The main points of the important instructions are as follows: "The 上决 [likely a typo, should be 上级 Upper Level] rebellion and the violent acts of the rebel army have greatly disrupted the unified command and violated military discipline. For the sake of building the Imperial Army's guiding principles and prestige, it is deeply regrettable. The army must now overcome all difficulties, eradicate such incidents, and reassure the Emperor. To make a fresh start and rebuild the Imperial Army, the entire army must unite with the greatest determination, stake their lives, and move forward together. Therefore, we expect the strengthening of the spiritual education of each unit and the thoroughness of moral education. Subordinates must not be confused by rumors and gossip, and we must strictly prohibit reckless actions. As for disciplinary actions and punishments, the laws are strict and impartial, and there will be no leniency. However, when applying the law, we must pay attention to the current domestic situation, which needs to be corrected and reformed. The military central department, together with the reform of national policy, will move forward together within the Control Department." (Dentsu, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">US Election Campaign; Republican Party Nominates Presidential Candidates <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Washington: The Republican Party today launched a campaign in the Midwest to select presidential candidates, attacking the New Deal and protecting the interests of the business community and private individuals. Judging from the situation in the eastern states, it seems that the large commercial sectors on the Atlantic coast are eager to support the Republican Party and believe that Kansas Governor Landon is the most promising presidential candidate. At the same time, the capitalists who provide the party's election expenses all believe that Landon is more likely to defeat President Roosevelt than Chicago publisher Knox. However, if Knox can make a final effort before the party holds its election convention, those in the East who support Landon may be willing to switch their support to Knox as a candidate. According to knowledgeable observers, the eastern states do not show much enthusiasm for Senator Borah's radical opposition to the New Deal. The northeastern states on the Atlantic coast are not very concerned about the Republican Party's presidential candidate, but their desire for President Roosevelt to leave the White House is very urgent. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington: The movement to nominate Republican presidential candidates has two very distinct developments: 1. Borah has entered the primary campaign in New Jersey. 2. The position of Kansas Governor Landon is also becoming clearer. Although Landon has stated that his state affairs are busy and that he has decided to abandon participating in the campaign in order to maintain party harmony, the faction led by Republican Senator Pope has decided to support Landon as the presidential candidate. Therefore, the divisions within the Republican Party are now very clear. Borah's faction is the progressive faction, while Landon is the conservative faction. It is reported that the Republican primary campaign in New Jersey will be held on May 19th. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Song Zheyuan Discusses the Recent Situation of North China Diplomacy <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Always Uphold Sincerity and Peace in Dealing with Friendly Nations.  Determined to Exert Utmost Efforts to Defend Territory and Interests.  Determine a Plan to Seek National Salvation from Ourselves.</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council and concurrently Chairman of Hebei Province, recently delivered an important speech, frankly discussing issues such as North China's diplomacy. He stated, "Because I have been away from the province for a long time, I have returned to Baoding to preside over all government affairs. I originally planned to stay in Baoding for a few days before going on tour to various counties in southern Hebei to inquire about the suffering of the people. However, due to time constraints, it is difficult to go, and I have decided to suspend the tour for the time being. After questioning the county magistrates in Baoding, I will return to Ping, or go on tour again when I come to the province next time. Since recent years, various undertakings in Hebei Province have been extremely corrupt. Everything from telephones to road administration has become unusable. When I decided to go to Shandong, I reached the border between the two provinces and saw that the roads in the two provinces were very different. The Shandong territory was flat and wide, while the Hebei territory was rugged and uneven. Telephone poles in Shandong were as high as thirty or forty feet, while those in Hebei were only a little over ten feet. Such things must be thoroughly revitalized and realistically rectified. I have now ordered the Department of Construction to take charge of the matter in order to facilitate transportation and enhance the appearance. After the rampancy of the communist bandits in western Shanxi, the military situation for suppressing bandits has become tense day by day. The communist bandits also have the intention of infiltrating Taiyuan. The Shanxi army has now deployed solid defenses in Taiyuan, so they will probably not succeed. If the Shanxi bandits fail to infiltrate Taiyuan, they may flee north to the Sui territory and will not flee east to Hebei Province, because the province is a vast plain where bandits cannot hide. Moreover, heavy troops are stationed at various passes on the western border of Hebei, so even if they come, it will be difficult to invade. Red Spear Society bandits and communist bandits in southern Hebei have been surrounded by troops, and political forces have been used to actively eliminate them. It is hoped that there will be no worries. The issue of North China diplomacy has not progressed since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, and all kinds of issues are in a state of stagnation. It seems that the Japanese side has not clearly decided on a definite diplomatic policy towards North China. Recently, the Japanese officials responsible for North China have also been transferred, so all issues have become unresolved. As for our North China authorities, we have decided to exert our utmost efforts in everything under the principle of defending territory and interests, and we have formulated appropriate steps to decide to seek national salvation from ourselves. We hope to create a new atmosphere within five years, so that the main policies of politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and construction can be brought into line. Then there is hope for self-rescue and national salvation. The diplomatic policy of North China is still to deal with everything with an attitude of 'peace and sincerity.' I will meet with Japanese Ambassador Arita after he comes to North China, but it has not been decided. If it is necessary to have a meeting at that time, I also plan to express to him the North China authorities' ardent hope for maintaining peace in East Asia, hoping that both sides will achieve genuine mutual assistance and cooperation. The issue of abolishing the puppet organization in eastern Hebei is also in a state of stagnation. In short, I am responsible for defending the territory of North China. Internally, I must thoroughly rectify everything and realistically revitalize the national spirit in order to seek self-determination. Externally, I will always uphold the principle of sincerity and peace and maintain peace in East Asia with friendly nations. In addition, in order to strengthen the local capacity to defend against bandits in Hebei Province, it has been decided to divide ten security zones, each with a commander, to effectively lead the people to overcome difficulties and defend themselves. The Baojia system is a facility to build the ability of the people themselves organization, so it was decided to order all counties to still apply the mandatory system, no longer set up additional recruitment officer, causing additional people's burden, and the province is financially strapped, and the people's economy has also become bankrupt. At present, in order to reduce the burden on the people, it has been decided to exempt all additional donations. Strict orders have been issued to all counties to handle the matter conscientiously, and it is estimated that additional donations can be reduced by as much as 2 million yuan per year. As for the provincial treasury itself, there have been huge deficits over the years. The province's annual income is only over 14 million yuan, while the annual expenditure budget is over 19 million yuan. Income cannot cover expenditure, and there is always a shortfall. I have decided to allocate and apply the province's budget based on the original income item of over 14 million yuan, and strive to do so on the principle of economizing expenditures. The Poor People's Association in western Hebei is harassing the local area. According to investigations, most of them are salt farmers who are unable to pay taxes and go astray. The tax police in the Pingxiang area have now been withdrawn, and personnel have been sent to study the geology of the area, hoping to scientifically improve the barren salt land so that it can be used to grow farmland. Once the people have fields to cultivate, they will naturally not embark on dangerous paths again. Regarding the dispute over the exchange of counties between Hebei and Henan, the local people in this province have been arguing fiercely, and for the sake of the safety of North China, we cannot ignore the river defenses along the river. Therefore, I have forwarded the petition of the people of this province to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Interior to revoke the previous proposal. If it is inconvenient to change due to the fact that the Executive Yuan has already passed the resolution, we must also take the Yellow River as the boundary and seek a compromise." (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Dongzhuang Yellow River Breach Expected to Close Soon <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Closing Project is Extremely Rapid. Water from the Breach Flows into the Old River.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The closing project of the Dongzhuang Yellow River breach is progressing rapidly even in the dead of winter. The encroachment project began on January 1 and was completed on the 19th of this month. A total of 31 sections of the west dike, 62 meters in length, and 9 sections of the east dike, 174 meters in length, were constructed. The breach is now only 39.3 meters wide. Side dikes are also being built, each 10 meters shorter than the main dikes on the east and west sides. Since the evening of the 19th, willow mattresses have been thrown from the heads of the two dikes, and earth cabinets have been filled between the two dikes. The willow mattress workers work in shifts, day and night, without rest. Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, along with all the staff, Wang Yujun, etc., are supervising the work on the dam day and night, under great tension. A willow mattress can be thrown every ten to fifteen minutes. Three hundred willow mattresses are thrown from the heads of both dikes day and night. As of the evening of the 23rd, the west dike had been thrown 8 meters out of the water, and the east dike had been thrown 6.5 meters. The breach is now only 25 meters long. The river water in the breach is about 10 meters deep at the deepest point. That evening, the northeast wind was very strong, which was quite beneficial to the work. Therefore, Kong accelerated the work by taking the opportunity, and it is expected that all the water can be discharged by the evening of the 24th, and the side dikes will be used to occupy and close the gap. Ten cabinets will be built on the dam, and then hemp bags filled with stone and earth will be thrown in front of the willow mattresses to seal the air, and the closing will be successful. If there are no special changes, it can be completed as scheduled on the 25th. A total of six diversion channels are being controlled, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, above the breach, to divert the water from the breach. The fourth channel is the Lishun Village North Diversion Channel, below the breach, directly opposite the lower mouth of the third diversion channel. Removing the river bend can make the river water flow smoothly. After starting to throw willow mattresses on the evening of the 19th, the water in the breach gradually increased. On the morning of the 20th, the five and six diversion channels were opened, and the water situation stabilized immediately. It rose again in the afternoon, and when the second diversion channel was reopened, a southwest wind blew strongly, which was in the right direction for the fourth diversion channel. Soldiers and laborers were mobilized, and the channel was opened by taking the opportunity. The riverhead had already automatically washed away a part, so it was opened smoothly. Then the third diversion channel was also opened. The water was surging and the situation was very good. On the 22nd, the total river flow was measured to be 670 cubic meters per second. The breach still flowed 520 cubic meters per second, while the old river and diversion channel flowed 150 cubic meters per second. On the 23rd, the water in the diversion channel increased even more. The fourth diversion channel has reached a depth of four meters. Therefore, although the breach is gradually narrowing, the water level has not risen. The first diversion channel was opened the earliest, and it has recently merged with the old river to form a river surface more than 100 feet wide. According to the evaluation of the Engineering Office, the completion of this diversion channel not only fundamentally reduces the water in the breach but also straightens the river channel, and the improvement of the river course has also achieved considerable success in the fundamental river management plan. Kong Xiangrong has now sent a telegram to Minister Kong, Secretary-General Qin Fen of the Economic Commission, Inspector Fang Juehui, and Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu, reporting on the opening of the diversion channel and the preparation for the breach closing project.

<h3 id="e75">Gansu Provincial Government to Repair the Yellow River Iron Bridge <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>—Simultaneously Construct the Qin-Tao Branch Line of the Gansu-Sichuan Road—</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong has been actively implementing measures to clarify officialdom, rectify tax collection, and promote various construction projects. Because the Yellow River Iron Bridge has been in disrepair for many years and is only two years away from its insurance deadline, if repairs are not promptly sought, it is feared that a disaster will occur, and the losses will be great. He ordered the Department of Construction to send personnel to survey and estimate the cost, which is estimated to require over 17,988 yuan in temporary repair expenses. Later, Wu Boqiong and Li Shiduo, technical specialists from the provincial government, were sent to re-survey and confirm the cost, which was submitted to the 386th meeting of the provincial affairs conference for resolution. Approval was granted for the repairs, and the labor and material costs were allocated as requested. The Gansu-Sichuan Highway is an important thoroughfare for transportation between Gansu Province and Sichuan Province. Although the Department of Construction has sent teams to survey, it has not been built due to a lack of funds. Chairman Yu resolutely raised over 140,000 yuan from the very tight funds to first repair the Qin-Tao branch line of the Gansu-Sichuan Highway in order to lay a foundation. This was also approved by the provincial affairs conference, and the Finance Department was ordered to allocate the funds.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Jiangxi Province Land Consolidation Plan <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Divide into Nine Zones, Five Phases, Scheduled to Be Completed in Eight Years. Total Funding of Over 10,680,000 Yuan Required.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The land consolidation plan in this province has been adopted since May 21st with the use of aerial surveys, starting with a pilot project in Nanchang County. By January 23rd, the aerial surveying of all fields and mu in the county was completed, and 8,615 original land maps were produced. The Land Bureau sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that the aerial surveying test had achieved considerable results. The Land Bureau then formulated a land consolidation plan for the entire province to promote it throughout the province. The 82 counties including Xinjian were divided into five zones and consolidated in five phases. The first zone is Xinjian and 9 other counties, the second zone is Ji'an and 10 other counties, the third zone is Poyang and 14 other counties, the fourth zone is Pengze and 22 other counties, and the fifth zone is Guangze and 22 other counties. It is estimated to be completed in eight years, requiring a total of 10,681,195 yuan in land consolidation fees. This has now been approved by the Provincial Affairs Conference. The contents of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>Division of Zones</p>
<p>The province's 83 counties, excluding Nanchang County, which has completed operations during the aerial survey pilot project, are divided into five zones: Zone 1: Xinjian, Anyi, Jinxian, Qingjiang, Dongxiang, Fengcheng, Gao'an, Linchuan, Xingan, Jinxi, and ten other counties; Zone 2: Ji'an, Jishui, Yongfeng, Xiajiang, Xinyu, Taihe, Chongren, Yihuang, Le'an, Anfu, Wan'an, and eleven other counties; Zone 3: Poyang, Yugan, Shangrao, Guixi, Yiyang, Yujiang, Hengfeng, Leping, Dexing, Fuliang, Yushan, Guangfeng, Qianjiang, Wannian, Wuyuan, and fifteen other counties; Zone 4: Pengze, Hukou, Jiujiang, Xingzi, Duchang, Ruichang, De'an, Yongxiu, Wuning, Jing'an, Fengxin, Xiushui, Tonggu, Yifeng, Shanggao, Wanzai, Fenyi, Yichun, Pingxiang, Lianhua, Yongxin, Ninggang, Suichuan, and twenty-three other counties; Zone 5: Guangze, Zixi, Lichuan, Nancheng, Nanfeng, Guangchang, Shicheng, Ningdu, Ruijin, Xingguo, Lingdu, Ganxian, Nankang, Xinfeng, Shangyou, Chongyi, Dayu, Xunwu, Huichang, Anyuan, Dingnan, Qiannan, Longnan, and twenty-three other counties.</p>
<p>Aerial Survey Operations</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Aerial Survey Team will first photograph the shapes of each land plot on the film within each county's area, and then measure the longitudinal and transverse triangulation locks to correct the re-photographs and enlarge them into 1/1000 photo maps. They will then take them to the field for drawing, creating the original land map. The Jiangxi Provincial Land Bureau will conduct field surveys based on the original land map, including area measurement, map production, and record creation. The land registration offices in each county and the land registration offices in each district will then handle land registration. The various types of operations are described separately below: (A) Aerial surveying is divided into the following five items: Aerial photography uses an aerial camera with an 18 cm square film to capture 1/10,000 scale negatives, overlapping by 1/3 from front to back and 1/2 from side to side, to provide the basis for enlarging the original land map. Large mountains and lakes without farmland will not be photographed to save time and money. Control uses theodolites and multi-image cameras to measure longitudinal and transverse triangulation locks, with a distance of 10 kilometers between each lock. The entire area is divided into several small areas according to natural boundaries such as large mountains and rivers. Each small area starts counting from a new point to avoid accumulating errors. Correction corrects the 1/10,000 negatives with control points and enlarges them into 1/2,500 scale photos. The negatives without control points are corrected based on ground features. The map outlines are then divided and map numbers are assigned. Re-photography enlarges the corrected 1/2,500 scale photos to 1/1,000 scale photo maps using the straight-line re-photography method. Drawing takes the photo maps to the field to identify the boundaries, land categories, and names of cities, towns, villages, roads, mountains, and rivers of each land plot, and records them in detail. The forests, shaded areas, and unclear parts of the photos are then surveyed and mapped to create the original land map. (B) Land registration is divided into the following five items: Surveying first determines the boundaries of the county, district, and village near the local area based on the scope of the county, district, and village determined in the original aerial survey map. Then, based on the original land map, it divides the land price zones, determines the standard land price, and submits it to the land price estimation committee for estimation, creating and publishing a land price zone map. Area measurement uses a planimeter or the three-oblique method to measure and determine the area of each land plot and compiles the total area to create various statistical tables. Mapping copies the original land map to create the land map and reduces the total map, as well as a list map of counties, districts, and villages. Record creation compiles the land register and land tax household register based on the registered land ownership and estimated land price. The land register records the name, address, land category, area, land price, and annual tax payable of the owner of each land plot. Registration establishes a county land registration office in the county where the surveying and compilation have been completed to manage land registration matters throughout the county. Land registration offices are established in districts where surveying, area measurement, and mapping have been completed. Land registration is handled within a time limit, and land ownership certificates are issued for each land plot, with land maps attached.</p>
<p>Consolidation Period</p>
<p>The consolidation period required for each zone is estimated as follows: Zone 1, aerial surveying started in July 23rd of the Republic of China, completed in June 25th, and consolidation completed in June 26th; Zone 2, aerial surveying started in July 25th, completed in June 26th, and consolidation completed in June 28th; Zone 3, aerial surveying started in July 26th, completed in June 27th, and consolidation completed in June 29th; Zone 4, aerial surveying started in July 27th, completed in June 28th, and consolidation completed in June 30th; Zone 5, aerial surveying started in July 28th, completed in June 29th, and consolidation completed in June 31st. From July 23rd of the Republic of China, when aerial surveying of the land maps of the eleven counties including the first zone, Xinjian, began, to June 31st, when the farmland repair of the entire province was completed, a total of eight years are required.</p>
<p>Funding Required</p>
<p>Based on the needs of the operations, the estimated amount of funding required for each zone is as follows: Zone 1, Xinjian, and ten other counties have a land area of 74,584 square li, including 6,793,224 mu of farmland, requiring 2,052,702 yuan for consolidation fees and 466,000 yuan for aerial surveying start-up fees, for a total of 2,518,702 yuan. Zone 11, Poyang and fifteen other counties have a land area of 110,962 square li, including 6,753,853 mu of farmland, requiring a total of 2,026,117 yuan for consolidation fees. Zone 4, Jiujiang and twenty-two other counties have a land area of 131,813 square li, including 6,484,361 mu of farmland, requiring a total of 1,992,019 yuan for consolidation fees. Zone 5, Ganxian and twenty-two other counties have a land area of 142,453 square li, including 1,330,245 mu of farmland, requiring a total of 1,921,617 yuan for consolidation fees. The total land consolidation fee required for the eighty-two counties including Xinjian (excluding Nanchang County) is 10,681,195 yuan. This funding will be paid from the land registration certificate fee revenue of each county.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Guangdong Provincial Department Requests Funds to Run Relief Programs <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>—Allocated to Eighty-Two County Bureaus—</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In Guangdong's three-year administration plan, great emphasis is placed on relief programs. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. However, there have been cases where, due to local poverty and difficulty in raising funds, the relief homes and civilian hospitals that should be established urgently have been delayed for a long time. Because rural areas are on the brink of bankruptcy, industry and commerce are struggling, disasters have not ceased, and there are more and more poor people in need of relief in various counties, the Provincial Civil Affairs Department Minister Lin Yizhong, in view of this, previously requested approval from the provincial treasury to allocate 100,000 yuan, and together with the Department's saved relief funds of more than 60,000 yuan, distribute them to the poorer counties, with 4,000 yuan to the larger ones and 1,000 yuan to the smaller ones, ordering them to be saved as a relief fund. Since then, after deciding to allocate supplementary subsidies, the Civil Affairs Department has continued to urge the effective implementation of the program. The relief homes and civilian hospitals in various counties have been prepared and established one after another, but it is still not universal. Recently, it was again requested that the provincial government allocate as much as possible 200,000 yuan from the Civil Affairs Department's saved funds and the saved funds of the surveying team when it was also handling land administration to be distributed to various county bureaus to enrich the relief fund, so that the income from interest is increased, and the power of relief is greater. It is planned to allocate 4,000 yuan to each of the eleven counties, including Lianping, for a total of 44,000 yuan; 3,000 yuan to each of the twenty-one counties, including Rao Ping, for a total of 63,000 yuan; 2,000 yuan to each of the thirty-six counties, including Haifeng, for a total of 72,000 yuan; and 1,500 yuan to each of the fourteen counties, including Guangning, for a total of 21,000 yuan, for a total allocation of 200,000 yuan to eighty-two county bureaus.</p>

<p>The case of Zhou Gu, the adoptive grandmother of Zhou Xinzhen in the Third District, Xiaoyuan Village, poisoning her four-year-old adopted grandson Zhou Tianrong, was publicly tried in the criminal court yesterday. Zhou Gu and Zhou Xingdi, who were in custody, were brought in to await trial. The plaintiff, Zhou Hexi, hired lawyers Lian Oujin and Yu Fan to defend him. Magistrate Liu opened the court. First, Zhou Hexi testified regarding the charge of restricting freedom, stating that Chunxiang was a regular employee and there was no transaction of selling her. The prosecutor's charge of enslaving a person was unacceptable. He further testified that Zhou Gu indeed poisoned Tianrong and requested the court to impose the death penalty according to the law. Next, Zhou Gu and her daughter Zhou Xingdi testified, firmly denying any intention to harm the child. They claimed that Tianrong fell and became ill on July 23rd of last year and died from fright. Subsequently, Zhou Gu's defense lawyers, Sun Xicheng and Tang Ying, stood up and argued that Chunxiang's testimony regarding the poisoning was contradictory and unreliable and should not be adopted. After vigorous debate by the plaintiff's lawyers, Jin and Lian, the court announced the closing of arguments and scheduled the verdict for 2 PM on the 31st of this month. The defendants, Zhou Gu and Zhou Xingdi, were returned to custody.</p>

He was handed over to the county court for interrogation yesterday. As a result of the interrogation, he was ordered to repay in installments. Since Cheng was unable to pay the first installment of the embezzled funds, he was taken into custody. It was found that Cheng used to be a member of the county party headquarters' supervisory committee and had been expelled from the party for a previous case.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Youth and Society (Part 2) - Professor Sun Bentu, College of Liberal Arts, National Central University <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>China is fundamentally a vast nation. Although China is nominally a republic of five ethnicities – Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan – in terms of culture, aside from a small minority with some differences in religion and language, the entire country shares the same language, writing system, beliefs, and customs. Therefore, it is a unified, vast nation. In terms of population, it reaches 475 million, accounting for one-fourth of the world's population. Such a large nation governing a country with vast territory and abundant resources is unprecedented in world history. This is the third point we should commend.</p>
<p>In summary, a long history, a vast nation, and a self-contained, distinctive culture are inherent glorious achievements of Chinese society and are worthy of our praise. Our youth, recognizing these inherent glorious achievements, should strive to promote and carry them forward. This is the first responsibility.</p>
<p>Second, they bear the responsibility of building the future of society. Youth not only bear the responsibility of promoting the inherent glorious achievements of society but also the responsibility of correcting the inherent shortcomings of society. To correct inherent shortcomings, it is necessary to adopt the characteristic cultures of Europe and America to adapt to the needs of the times. Therefore, Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "After restoring all our national essence, we must also learn from the strengths of Europe and America to be able to compete with them."</p>
<p>Since China's communication with Europe and America, European and American culture has been continuously imported. As a result, society has undergone rapid changes. The inherent Chinese culture, which was previously regarded as the sole standard of society, has gradually begun to waver. European and American culture has penetrated all aspects of Chinese life. Not only has the new culture that our country lacked been widely introduced, but our excellent spiritual culture has also been greatly affected. If this trend continues without reversing the tide of Europeanization, China will be completely Europeanized, replacing our inherent special culture. We must know that if a country cannot retain its inherent special culture, then the country's life is very dangerous, because a country's unique special culture is where its national soul resides. Moreover, how can we allow the special culture in which our national soul is rooted to be shaken by foreign cultures when our country has such a long history and such a vast nation? Of course, we should learn from the strengths of Europe and America to compensate for our shortcomings, but at the same time, we should preserve our inherent strengths and allow them to flourish. This is the responsibility of youth. Generally speaking, China's strengths lie in morality, philosophy, art, writing, and so on. And the inherent special culture that I mentioned above is the "national soul" culture formed with inherent morality and philosophy as the backbone. Europe and America's strengths lie in science. Natural science has produced modern machine culture; social science has produced modern political, economic, and educational organizational cultures. The new construction of Chinese society in the future should take China's inherent special culture as the backbone, as the foundation, and the scientific culture, machine culture, and organizational culture of Europe and America as branches and leaves, as nutrients. The New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement advocated by President Chiang are construction movements to promote inherent culture and develop scientific culture. The central responsibility for this new construction movement lies with our youth.</p>
<p>Third, the cultivation that youth should have</p>
<p>From the above, youth are so important in society, and youth have such great responsibilities to society. Then, how should they cultivate themselves so that they can be worthy of their position and bear this great responsibility? In my opinion, first, they should cultivate a sound personality; second, they should strengthen their physical health; and third, they should master specialized knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>First, cultivating a sound personality is the foundation of all endeavors. The achievement of great undertakings must be based on a sound personality. This sound personality has genuine value. It cannot be falsely decorated by oneself, nor can it be destroyed by others. Of course, in a turbulent world, upright people are often slandered by others because right and wrong are unclear. However, if a person truly has a sound personality with genuine value, then even if they are temporarily slandered by others, there will eventually be a day when right and wrong become clear. Therefore, youth should cultivate a sound personality with genuine value. In detail, a sound personality must have at least eight spirits.</p>
<p>The spirit of self-governance. People must have the spirit of self-governance. This spirit is what the ancients called self-restraint. All human virtues are mostly cultivated from the effort of self-restraint.</p>
<p>The spirit of self-improvement. People must have the spirit of continuous self-improvement. This spirit enables people not to be subdued by the reality of the environment but to struggle forward. All progress in life comes from this spirit.</p>
<p>The scientific spirit. People must cultivate the spirit of a scientist. Scientists are most full of the spirits of perseverance, caution, courage, and dedication. This spirit is the element of success in all endeavors.</p>
<p>The spirit of labor. People must have the spirit of hard work and endurance. All success in life comes from labor.</p>
<p>The spirit of justice. People must have the spirit of fighting for justice. Where there is justice, there is no room for complacency. Mencius said, "Wealth and honor cannot corrupt him, poverty and meanness cannot move him, and power and force cannot subdue him." This is the manifestation of the spirit of justice.</p>
<p>The spirit of solidarity. People must have the spirit of unity with society. Because individuals in society share weal and woe with the whole society, they must cooperate and help each other and unite sincerely in order to promote social progress. However, if abnormal solidarity is sufficient to harm social order and social morality, then, for the sake of maintaining justice, one should not associate with it.</p>
<p>The spirit of service. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said, "The purpose of life is service." He also said, "Service is the new morality of the world." Therefore, the general youth should have the spirit of serving society to increase the welfare of the people.</p>
<p>Aspiration—a fundamental spirit. Aspiration is the foundation of success. If a person cannot set aspirations, then even if they have the various spirits mentioned above, they still cannot achieve great undertakings. Therefore, Zeng Guofan said, "The first thing in life is to have aspirations."</p>
<p>Second, one must cultivate a healthy body. People must have a healthy body. With a healthy body, coupled with the cultivation of personality and the mastery of knowledge and skills, one can undertake great things. As the saying goes, "A sound mind resides in a sound body." This sentence is indeed correct.</p>
<p>Third, one must master specialized knowledge and skills. People must have specialized knowledge and skills, so that they can either seek a proper profession on a small scale or do great things for the country and society on a large scale. As for what kind of specialized knowledge and skills should be mastered, it is entirely up to one's own choice.</p>
<p>Only with a healthy body, a sound personality, and specialized knowledge and skills can youth shoulder the responsibility for society. This responsibility is to promote our country's inherent special culture and glorious history on the one hand, and to absorb the characteristic cultures of Europe and America to build a new culture that meets the needs of the times on the other hand. In this way, the revival of the entire Chinese nation can be promoted. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once told his comrades, "The revolution has not yet succeeded, and comrades still need to work hard." I am now imitating this sentence to respectfully tell the youth: "The nation is waiting to be revived, and the youth must work hard." (The End)</p>

<p>Inauguration Ceremony Scheduled for the 28th</p>
<p>Since Mayor Wu Tiecheng resigned from the concurrent post of Songhu Garrison Commander of this city, Chairman Chiang has selected Yang Xiaotian, the Director of the Municipal Security Office, to succeed him. The official order has already arrived in Shanghai. After receiving the order, Yang has scheduled the inauguration ceremony for the 28th of this month. The details are reported as follows:</p>
<p>Yang Hu Succeeds</p>
<p>The post of Songhu Garrison Commander has always been held concurrently by Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Now, Mayor Wu, considering the heavy municipal affairs of Shanghai and his inability to attend to both, specially telegraphed Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission to earnestly resign from the concurrent post, so as to concentrate on the prosperity of Greater Shanghai. His request was approved, and Yang Xiaotian, the Director of the Municipal Security Office, was selected to succeed him. The official order arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Yang's Remarks</p>
<p>After the news of Yang's succession as Songhu Garrison Commander was released, the reporter interviewed Yang at the Security Office headquarters in Fenglinqiao. He was granted an audience and said that he deeply felt the importance of his duties as Songhu Garrison Commander. During Mayor Wu's concurrent term, the order was maintained and the people lived in peace, all thanks to Wu's skillful management. He expressed his deep admiration for Mayor Wu's leadership as the director of the Security Office. Now that he has been ordered to succeed to the important task of Songhu Garrison Commander, he will follow Mayor Wu's intentions and continue his policies, hoping not to fail in his duties, etc.</p>
<p>Yang's Brief Biography</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Yang Hu, also known as Yang Xiaotian, is 49 years old and hails from Ningguo, Anhui. He is a veteran revolutionary general who has served alongside the late Premier, Martyr Chen Yingshi, and Chairman Chiang for many years, participating in numerous military operations.

He has excellent relationships with both Chinese and foreigners, and is highly praised by all parties. Now, he has once again been appointed as Garrison Commander, and with his experience, his merits will surely be even more evident.</p>
<p>Hurry to Complete</p>
<p>The original Security Office, it is heard, will be reorganized into a Security General Corps. The candidate for the post of General Corps Commander has been confirmed. According to the reporter's inquiry, it is said to be Ji Zhangjian, who is currently in Beijing and has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the departments of the Security Office began to rush to complete the preparations.</p>

<p>The Committee for Raising Donations to Purchase Aircraft for Chairman Chiang's Birthday, jointly organized by various circles, organizations, and individuals in this city, has received numerous responses from participants in recent days. Yesterday, it received responses from dozens of people, including the China Cultural Construction Association, the Finance Bureau, the Education Bureau, Ge Jichen, Tang Shoumin, Shen Tilan, and Sun Zhendong, expressing their participation as initiators. This shows the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life in celebrating.</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association received a telegram from its Jiangxi Provincial Branch, stating that the branch had resolved the day before to calculate based on the population of Nanchang city and assign responsibilities to the citizens, civil servants, military police, commercial, academic, and industrial circles. In accordance with the branch's regulations and the provisions of membership fees at all levels, it will actively solicit donations and plans to raise 80,000 yuan within half a month and send it to the headquarters for review and collection. It has also sent letters to various organizations, actively soliciting donations, so that everyone can participate in paying fees or donations within the deadline, in order to jointly celebrate the event.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Wu Tiecheng, the captain of the solicitation team of the China Aviation Association, yesterday received a telegram from Li Sen of the Special Party Department of the 33rd Division in Yangxin, Hubei, expressing sympathy for raising funds to purchase aircraft to celebrate the birthday. Due to his limited strength, he initiated a birthday blessing chain, advising friends from all sides to offer one yuan of national currency and send it to you for collection to purchase aircraft. He asked for receipts to be issued. Enclosed is one yuan of national currency and the chain, please check and accept. It has been heard that receipts have been sent to thank them for their enthusiasm. Please make more efforts. The birthday blessing chain is as follows: This year is the 50th birthday of Chairman Chiang, the sole revolutionary leader of the country and family. Various places are raising funds to purchase aircraft to present as a birthday gift. We plan to offer one yuan of national currency to express our humble intentions. By gathering a little, we can achieve a lot. By combining the strength of the group, we can also raise funds to purchase aircraft to convey our birthday wishes. We hope that after receiving this chain, comrades will copy fifteen copies within twenty-four hours, keep one copy, and send one copy with one yuan of national currency to Mr. Wu Tiecheng of the China Aviation Association in Shanghai. The remaining fourteen copies should be sent to the comrades and friends of the comrades. It is easier to lift a tripod with many hands, and a handful of soil can become a mountain. We hope that comrades will show their enthusiasm for believing in the leader and jointly celebrate the grand event. This is what we hope for. The respondents to this chain include Ruan Chao of the First Battalion of the Sixth Security Regiment of Hubei and Li Shixi, who each sent one yuan and one dime of national currency.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Mayor Wu received 4 yuan of national currency sent by Hua Hanchun from Zhenjiang, with a note saying that it is admirable that Your Worship initiated the gift of revolutionary transformation on the occasion of President Chiang's fiftieth birthday this year. The savings from the Spring Festival brushwork income are offered. Gu Youcheng from No. 9 Ruyuan Lane, Zhenjiang, remitted 10 yuan of legal tender from the Zhenjiang Bank of China, please combine it for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebrations. It has been heard that they have all been handed over to the fundraising and aircraft purchase committee for counting and letters of thanks have been sent. (Above by Central News Agency). The Shanghai Marine Engineers Association, because this year is the celebration of President Chiang's grand birthday, but in view of the national crisis, the association specially proposed by the chairman of the committee, Feng Yuming, to follow the example of various groups in Shanghai, also勉集 500 yuan, and sent it to Yang Hu of the Seafarers Party Department, asking him to transfer it for military construction. The款 was approved by the committee yesterday and was sent out immediately. The original letter said,窃以蒋公中正, esteemed at home and abroad,德迈羣伦,既坚贞卓强,复刻苦耐劳, 文治武功,作中枢之砥柱, 内安外攘, 树民族之荣光, 受命于危难之中, 万民瞻仰, 应付见经纬之富, 举国同钦,顷阅报载, 今岁适逢蒋公五秩寿辰, 属会欣聆鹊报, 颂扬曷极,兹特备代仪五百元正, 送呈钧处, 请即联络各海昌团体, 共起庆贺, 幷商筹鉅欵, 以海员社团名义, 购买飞机或军用汽车等, 以作祝嘏之礼品, 旣可表示海员社团, 对于国家领袖之坚决信仰, 又可利我军事建设之进行所需, 区区微忱, 敬先奉献, 是吾有当,理合附同交通银行礼劵法币五百元, 备文呈送, 仰祈鉴核查收, 幷予示遵, 不胜感戴之至, 谨呈中华海员党务特派员杨, 附交通银行礼券法币五百元, 中国轮机员联合总会谨呈.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Industry orders the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau</p>
<p>Should notify relevant merchants</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry approved the consultation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, approving the British Ambassador Jardine's statement that the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries of the United Kingdom issued the 1935 revised plant import order, which came into effect from February 1, 1936. For beetroot (Sugar beet and mangold beta vuigais Linn) transported from foreign countries, all raw vegetables, whole or in part, except for vegetable seeds, are prohibited from being unloaded in England and Wales without the permission of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The Scottish Agriculture Board and the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture have also issued similar orders, so the same regulations also apply in Scotland and Northern Ireland, etc. After the Ministry of Industry approved the consultation, it has ordered the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to be notified and also instructed relevant merchants to pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Imported Cotton Seeds Limited to Shanghai for the Time Being <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Must be inspected and qualified before import is allowed</p>
<p>The National Economic Commission's Cotton Industry Control Committee believes that in order to improve cotton production in recent years, our country has often purchased cotton seeds from the United States. However, imported seeds sometimes contain dangerous insects and bacteria that our country does not have. If disinfection procedures are not carried out at the time of import, the attached insects and bacteria will inevitably enter the country and spread everywhere, and the harm will be unimaginable. A special letter was sent to the Ministry of Industry, requesting that before the implementation of plant pest and disease inspection by the commodity inspection bureaus in various places, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau should be responsible for the inspection and disinfection of imported cotton seeds. After receiving the letter, the Ministry of Industry expressed its approval in matters of inspection administration. However, plant pest and disease inspection by inspection bureaus other than Shanghai must wait until preparations are complete before they can be opened. The inspection and disinfection of imported cotton seeds should first be handled by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. All imported cotton seeds should be temporarily limited to import through Shanghai and must be inspected and qualified before import is allowed. The bureau has been ordered to comply and contact the Jianghai Customs for handling.</p>

<p>No Difficulties Encountered</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a letter from the Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Batavia, reporting on the situation of Chinese goods imported into the Dutch East Indies. The Chamber of Commerce has issued a circular to all relevant industries for their information. The original letter is as follows: According to the minutes of the second annual general meeting of the standing directors of our association on the 6th of this month, one of the matters discussed concerned the Dutch East Indies government. Since implementing restrictions on the import of goods from various countries, the Import Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs has granted special preferential treatment to formally registered import firms importing Chinese goods, allowing them to import additional quantities. However, reports in domestic newspapers state that there are various difficulties in importing national products into the Dutch East Indies, which is not in accordance with the facts. The current situation regarding the transit of national products here can be divided into three categories: 1. National products not subject to restrictions in the Dutch East Indies can be freely imported, the same as before. 2. National products that are subject to restrictions can still obtain additional special import permits, provided they have an official permit and export documentation. 3. National products are subject to the same import taxes as goods from other countries, with no exceptional difficulties. We should send letters to chambers of commerce and industrial associations in various parts of the country to clarify the situation regarding the import of national products here. It was resolved to proceed with this matter and to send a letter to inform you and request that you forward the above information to national product manufacturers in your area to correct any misperceptions and benefit national products.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Flood Relief Association: Yesterday's Reception for All Sectors <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Purchase of "Fortune Fruit" Tickets</p>
<p>Extremely Warm Response to Donations of Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces, for the purpose of issuing "Fortune Fruit" tickets, held a tea party yesterday at 4:00 PM on the ninth floor of the YMCA, inviting leaders from all sectors of the city. Mr. Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Association's Committee, made a special trip from Beijing to attend and receive guests from all walks of life. Leaders from all sectors were very enthusiastic about purchasing "Fortune Fruit" tickets and donating goods. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Those present yesterday included Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee and Chairman of the Association's Committee; Wang Zhen, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Fund Custody Committee; Mayor Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao); Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Wang Xiaolai, Speaker of the Municipal Council; Zhu Shaoping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Gazetteer Office; and more than 70 others, including Cheng Jingsheng, Qu Wenliu, Huang Qinglan, Wen Lanting, Mao Yun, and Xiong Xiling.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Around 4:00 PM, leaders from all sectors had gathered, and the tea party began. After refreshments were served, Mr. Zhu Qinglan gave a report, saying: "I am extremely honored that all of you great philanthropists and local leaders have graced us with your presence today. I just returned from Nanjing today. Minister Kong could not attend due to important official duties in Beijing and asked me to apologize to you on his behalf. Last year's floods in various provinces were already mitigated by your efforts, and the lives of the disaster victims were extended to this day through various methods such as emergency relief and winter relief. This is truly not easy. But now spring plowing is critical. Many disaster victims are returning after fleeing, and if we don't rush to save them, all our previous efforts will be in vain. I believe all sectors will not bear to see this happen. However, the economy is sluggish, and raising funds is extremely difficult. At this moment, our Shanghai Relief Association for Flood Disasters in Various Provinces, because Ms. Yao of Suzhou destroyed her home to help those in need and donated all her property to our association, we and our colleagues initiated this Goods Relief Association, following the example of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, soliciting relief funds and giving away "Fortune Fruit" tickets. The significance of this is that, on the one hand, it allows those who donate goods to do good deeds, and on the other hand, it allows those who contribute to the relief funds to do good deeds on their behalf, while also giving each individual a small commemorative gift. Therefore, the task of this association is to solicit goods and solicit relief funds to give away "Fortune Fruit" tickets. The two tasks must be carried out simultaneously. The value of the gifts we have already received has reached 80,000 to 90,000 yuan, but the number of items is still less than 3,000. There are not enough gifts to cover all the tickets. This is why we need all of you to help us a lot. Any kind of thing can be donated as a gift first. As for the matter of giving away tickets, in addition to those who have already taken on the responsibility, there are still 4,000 tickets that we need to rely on all of you here to work hard on. As for the method of solicitation, please give us as much guidance as possible. I am certainly one of them, but I hope that we can all work together to give away all 12,000 tickets so that the disaster victims can receive a final relief, which will bring immeasurable blessings to all of you."</p>
<p>Support from All Sides</p>
<p>After Mr. Zhu's report, Mr. Xiong Xiling expressed his opinion, saying: "In recent years, the disaster situation in the country has been serious, and the people are suffering in water and fire. Fortunately, philanthropists have been running around and appealing on behalf of the disaster victims. Now that spring plowing is about to begin, and with Ms. Yao's donation of her family property, issuing 'Fortune Fruit' tickets to help the disaster victims, we should really work hard to complete this good deed." Then, Qu Wenliu reported, saying: "The number of 'Fortune Fruit' tickets issued this time is 120,000 yuan, of which 80,000 yuan will be used to relieve the disaster victims in Subei. The disaster in Subei occurred later, and the disaster situation is more serious than in other provinces. The disaster relief funds allocated at that time have mostly been distributed, so the funds received for emergency relief and winter relief in Subei were particularly small at that time. This time, it should get more, but because of the large number of disaster victims, this small amount is still a drop in the bucket. Therefore, everyone should work hard to save more lives and create more blessings. Of the 120,000 yuan of 'Fortune Fruit' tickets, 80,000 yuan have already been pledged, and the remaining 40,000 yuan should not be difficult to obtain and can hopefully be fully donated in the near future." Then, Li Dachao expressed his opinion on behalf of Mayor Wu, saying: "Mayor Wu expresses his deep sympathy for the issuance of 'Fortune Fruit' tickets this time and hopes to do his best to promote this matter as soon as possible, and hopes that all of you will also work together."</p>
<p>Number of Purchases</p>
<p>Cheng Jingsheng reported on the situation of the "Fortune Fruit" ticket purchases, saying: "The Jiangsu Provincial Government has already pledged 3,000 tickets, Qu Wenliu pledged 2,000 tickets, the Bankers Association pledged 200 tickets, Wang Yiting 200 tickets, Zhu Ziqiao 1,000 tickets, Cheng Jingsheng 300 tickets, and Chairman Liu of Anhui, Chairman Song of Hebei, and Mayor Xiao of Tianjin have also pledged certain amounts. Yu Baoqing 50 tickets, Xiong Xiling 50 tickets, Zhu Shaoping 20 tickets, Deng Xingwu Zhenji Factory combined 10 tickets, totaling about 80,000 yuan. Therefore, it is expected that the total amount of 120,000 yuan can be fully pledged in the near future."</p>
<p>Donations</p>
<p>During yesterday's tea party, donations of goods from all sectors were also very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, there were 50 pieces of Wang Xian's calligraphy and paintings and antiques, 30 pieces of Ding Monong's vertical scrolls, 15 pieces of Zhu Jingqi's calligraphy and paintings, 15 pieces of Yan Ganyuan's calligraphy and paintings (plus mounting), 20 pieces of Zhu Jia, 10 pieces of Tao Lengdan's calligraphy and paintings, 30 pieces of Xiong Xiling, 100 pieces of Wang Yiting's paintings, 20 pieces of Ma Gongyu's calligraphy and paintings, 5 pieces of Lu Danlin's calligraphy and paintings, 10 pieces of Yu Jianhua's calligraphy and paintings, 5 pieces of Ma Qizhou's calligraphy and paintings, 30 volumes, 50 pieces of Wu Dongmai's calligraphy and paintings, 20 pieces of Xu Muru's photography and calligraphy and paintings. Qin Qingzeng 5 pieces and 5 volumes of painting albums, Shen Yi 5 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Xiong Songquan 5 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Li Wuyun 20 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Zhao Hengyang 20 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Xie Gongzhan 20 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Yu Baochun 10 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Liu Haisu 20 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Tian Jidong 30 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Sun Xueni 20 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, Ji Jue 200 pieces of calligraphy and paintings, etc.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhu's conversation with a reporter from the Central News Agency after the meeting, he was deeply gratified by the enthusiastic participation of leaders from all sectors in today's tea party, and he was deeply grateful to the disaster victims for the enthusiasm shown in donating goods and purchasing "Fortune Fruit" tickets. "When I was in Beijing before, I talked with key figures in the central government about issuing 'Fortune Fruit' tickets and donating goods, and they were all very enthusiastic. Chairman Lin promised to personally donate calligraphy and paintings, for which I am very grateful. I left Beijing this morning and only arrived in Shanghai this afternoon. After staying in Shanghai for a while, I will go to Beijing again when the 'Fortune Fruit' tickets are properly handled, and then go to the disaster area to handle spring clothing matters."</p>

<h3 id="e99">Shanghai Municipal Council: Number of Votes for Elected Foreign Councilors <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Oversight Led to 300+ Votes Being Omitted; List of Elected Councilors Unchanged</p>
<p>The results of the election for foreign councilors of the Shanghai Municipal Council were published in Chinese and foreign newspapers yesterday. However, the number of votes announced on that day was inaccurate due to a temporary oversight, with 323 votes omitted. After discovering this yesterday morning, a recount was immediately conducted. The names of the elected foreign councilors and the number of votes they received are listed below: Name (Nationality) Votes Macnaghten, E.B. (British) 2012 Keswick, W.J. (British) 1988 Mitchell, G.E. (British) 1988 Poter, H. Calhoun (British) 1949 Calhoun, A.D. (American) 1902 Franklin, C.S. (American) 1896 Arnhold, H.E. (British) 1893 (Japanese) 880 Yamamoto Takeo (Japanese) 875 The above nine councilors were elected. Although the number of votes each received increased slightly, the order of election remained unchanged. The Japanese candidate councilor, Urabe Takue, received 874 votes, only one vote less than Mr. Yamamoto. The total number of votes cast was 2,799, with 19 invalid votes.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Municipal Council Announces: Investigation of Errors <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Side Demands Re-Election</p>
<p>Regarding the error in counting votes in the recent election of foreign councilors of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Municipal Council issued the following statement yesterday: "This year's election of councilors of the Municipal Council was conducted in accordance with the established practice for many years as stipulated in Article 18 of the Land Regulations. After the closing of the poll, the supervisors of the election, appointed by the Board of Directors, personally secured the ballot boxes at the training room of the Municipal Council Chamber of Commerce and the Hongkou Police Station, and brought them to the meeting room of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council. Then, the two vote counters appointed by the Board of Directors personally opened them and inspected the ballots obtained. At that time, after the vote counters counted the votes, they reported that a total of 2,482 election ballots and 13 invalid ballots had been obtained, and announced the names of the nine candidates with the most votes. At that time, the vote counters believed that the number of votes counted was accurate, and the list of elected persons was signed by the vote counters and announced by order of the Director-General of the Municipal Council. Afterwards, the election ballots that had been counted were immediately destroyed in accordance with the usual practice to prevent the leakage of the confidentiality of the vote. At this time, the ballot boxes were deemed to be empty and were locked in the Director-General's office. Unexpectedly, the next morning, it was discovered that some election ballots were left in the ballot box sent by the Hongkou Police Station. These election ballots, due to an unexplained error, were left in the box and were not counted. After this matter was discovered, the ballot box was properly kept in custody to await the arrival of the vote counters for a recount. After the vote counters re-inspected the ballots, a total of 323 election ballots were obtained, of which six were invalid. The numbers for the next day were immediately revised, and a new report was issued, signed by the vote counters, and the names of the nine candidates with the most votes were announced."</p>
<p>The Japanese-language Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun Evening Edition published yesterday stated that the international election battle had come to an end, and as a result, Japan had suffered a defeat. However, the Japanese Election Committee had doubts about the number of votes received and unanimously advocated for clarification. Today, Chairman Lin, along with the head of the Japanese Residents' Association and others, visited Mr. Fessenden and Secretary Johnson of the Municipal Council to question why the number of votes received by the Japanese side was so small, suspecting there were omissions. Mr. Fessenden replied that on the first day of the election, 323 votes from the Hongkou voting station were placed in the machine when they were sent to the office and were forgotten to be counted, so the actual number of votes did not match. Thereupon, Chairman Lin, considering the matter to be bizarre, visited Consul-General Ishii at the Consulate-General for the sake of investigation, and discussed emergency countermeasures with the candidates. At the same time, the attitude of the Japanese community suddenly hardened, because such a scandalous election must be investigated, and it is questionable whether it is fair to open the 323 votes in accordance with the statutory conditions. From the perspective of rectifying the election, the election should be corrected, because the Japanese side cast 2,808 votes, but only 2,483 votes were announced, and it is feared that the number is not even this high. It is argued that the election should be re-held in accordance with the Land Regulations. Mr. Fessenden said that the 323 votes were burned on the spot and could not be checked. If the Japanese side wants to re-hold the election, they can only comply.</p>

<p>The Victoria Ship Departs at 11:00 AM</p>
<p>According to the Xinshi News Agency, Mr. Gu Weijun, the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to France, was originally scheduled to leave the country on the 21st of last month to take up his new post, but his departure was postponed due to illness. After more than a month, he was scheduled to take a ship to France yesterday (the 25th), but was unable to do so due to other matters. It has now been decided that he will set sail on the Italian ship Victoria this afternoon, together with his wife, Ms. Huang Huilan, and his secretary, Shi Zhaokui, to go directly to France to take up his post. Mr. Liu Wendao, the Ambassador to Italy, has been in Shanghai for several days taking care of private matters and attending various social gatherings, which has kept him quite busy. Yesterday morning, he also visited Mr. Wang Chonghui at Hongen Hospital. He has now boarded the Italian ship Victoria this morning with his wife and others, and will set sail at 11:00 AM to return to Italy to take up his post.

<p>There Are Approximately 600,000 Overseas Chinese in Vietnam; Mr. Xu Met with Gu Weijun Yesterday Morning to Report on Everything</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Nianceng, the Consul-General stationed in Hanoi, returned to China from his post a few days ago, passed through Shanghai, and went to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang to report on the establishment of the consulate. After finishing his business, he returned to Shanghai by car at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. After getting off the car, he went to his hotel to rest. Then, at around 9:00 AM, he drove to the private residence of Ambassador to France Gu Weijun to report on the situation in his area of responsibility, and only left after talking for more than an hour. A reporter from the Xinxin News Agency interviewed Mr. Xu at his hotel yesterday and learned a great deal about the establishment of the consulate in Hanoi and the lives of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam. The details of his conversation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Establishment of the Consulate</p>
<p>According to Mr. Xu, there are a large number of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam. In order to promote Sino-Vietnamese commerce and protect the interests of Overseas Chinese, the government has long considered setting up consulates in Vietnam. The revision of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty was delayed and not agreed upon, so it could not be realized earlier. It was not until May of last year that the Sino-French-Vietnamese Treaty was officially signed and promulgated. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then decided to open a consulate-general in Hanoi, Vietnam, and a consulate in Saigon. I was ordered to be the first Consul-General stationed in Hanoi, and immediately returned to China from Russia. After receiving instructions from the Ministry, I went to Hanoi and arrived at the end of November last year. After everything was prepared, the consulate was officially opened on December 18th.</p>
<p>Current Situation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The entire territory of Vietnam is divided into five parts: Cochinchina, Annam, Tonkin, Cambodia, and Laos. Tonkin occupies an important position in politics and commerce because it is located in the center of Vietnam and is very close to our country's border. There are more than 600,000 Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, mostly from Guangdong. Among them, more than 200,000 live in Cochinchina, and the rest are scattered in various parts of Annam, Tonkin, and Cambodia. In terms of the occupations of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, there are many who work as coolies, but there are also many who occupy important positions in commerce. In addition, the scope of the businesses operated by Overseas Chinese in Vietnam is vast and far beyond the reach of local people. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of their businesses is closely related to Vietnamese commerce. It can be imagined how important the position of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam is.</p>
<p>Returning to Post Within a Week</p>
<p>The Vietnamese government authorities treat Overseas Chinese in Vietnam fairly well, so Overseas Chinese can live and work in Vietnam in peace. Now that the consulate has just been established, I have been ordered to be stationed in Vietnam and will naturally follow the government's will and work hard to promote the improvement of relations between the two countries. I will do my best to protect the legitimate interests of Overseas Chinese. As for the business situation of Overseas Chinese in Vietnam, in recent years, due to the impact of the world's economic downturn, there has been a downward trend. However, this situation is prevalent in countries around the world, not just Vietnam, etc. Mr. Xu's return to China this time was to go to Guangdong for negotiations and took the opportunity to pass through Hong Kong to Shanghai and then to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang to report on the establishment of the consulate. Now that his business is completed, he plans to return to his ancestral home in Wuxi after bidding farewell to Ambassador Gu before he leaves the country. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai within a week to return to his post.</p>

<p>Since the passing of Huang Chu'er, the various businesses he operated have also successively collapsed, resulting in numerous lawsuits. Several years have passed, yet the repercussions remain unresolved. The Gongfa Company, being one of Huang's key ventures, is no exception. Its debts amount to over three million yuan. Although creditors pursued the outstanding payments and the court executed auctions for compensation, the remaining amount was still eight-tenths of the total debt. Last year, a group of Gongfa's creditors, including Xu Peiyuan, noticed the names of Huayang Pharmacy and others listed in the company's shareholder register. They filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court to confirm partnership. The first instance court ruled in favor of Xu and the others. Huayang Pharmacy, feeling unjustly implicated, hired three lawyers, Li Guozhen, Lü Shifang, and Li Yujun, to file an appeal to the High Court Third Branch. Consequently, the original judgment was overturned, and Xu's claims in the first instance were rejected. Xu Peiyuan and the others, dissatisfied, appealed to the Supreme Court. Now, having reviewed the Supreme Court's Civil Judgment No. 2177 of the 24th year, the court rejected Xu's appeal, stating that "Huayang Pharmacy invested in Gongfa Company mistakenly believing it to be a joint-stock limited company, as determined by the original trial court. Therefore, they cannot be held liable for Gongfa Company's debts as partners." Since the implementation of the New Civil Code, the courts have often ordered joint and several liability for debts incurred by companies claiming to be joint-stock limited companies but not properly registered, regardless of the investor's intentions. This has been not only unfair but also led to financial ruin for some. With this precedent now established, it can be cited for support, thus preventing further unexpected losses.</p>

<p>Mr. Xia Li of Nanhui, after being recommended by Mr. Wang Yiting following Ambassador Xu's order to visit Japan, intended to travel east with them. Unexpectedly, someone made anonymous accusations. After investigation, none of the names listed in the letter existed. Nanhui's various organizations issued a joint statement, asserting that Mr. Xia was enthusiastic about public welfare, always diligent and prudent, and never engaged in the conduct described in the letter, to rectify the situation. County Magistrate Yuan also sent a letter to Mr. Wang, requesting him to convey Mr. Xia's character to Ambassador Xu. Mr. Xia disregarded this kind of senseless attack. Currently, due to other matters requiring organization, the date of Mr. Xia's departure remains uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Branches Supplying Goods to Headquarters: No Stamp Tax Required on Allocation Lists <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce replied to the Tongchang Car Company's Branch Management Department regarding stamp tax issues, stating that it received your letter of February 4th inquiring about the use of stamp tax. Now, the reply is as follows: Regarding the allocation lists used by branches to obtain goods from headquarters, if the relationship between the branch and the headquarters is not as described in the Ministry of Finance's Tax Ruling No. 7213, where "although the names are the same, the capital and operations are entirely independent," then according to Article 3, Clause 8 of the Stamp Tax Law, these allocation lists are internal audit documents and do not require stamp tax. Furthermore, Ministry of Finance's Tax Ruling No. 7137 also states that the allocation lists used by branch factories to report required materials to headquarters are exempt from stamp tax according to Article 3, Clause 8 of the Stamp Tax Law. This can be consulted for exemption. When branches remit funds to headquarters, the drafts issued by the remitter to the entrusted payer should be taxed according to Rate Table Clause 4. However, the remittance stubs used for internal bookkeeping are also exempt from stamp tax according to Article 3, Clause 8 of the Stamp Tax Law.</p>

<p>A small number of Communists incited students to form vigilante groups to prohibit and obstruct, shooting and wounding the police captain and two policemen from outside the school.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Songhu Garrison Command received reports that a small number of communists among Fudan University students were plotting to incite unrest, posing a significant threat to public security. In order to enforce the Emergency Law for the Maintenance of Security, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to send police to the university on the night before last (24th) to arrest six communists: Huang, Mo Zixin, Bao Yi, Jiang Wenzheng, Zheng Tongzhi, and Jiang Nanjun. Another suspect, Yang Bopeng, was apprehended yesterday afternoon (25th). Unexpectedly, a few communists at the school incited student vigilantes to strictly guard the front and rear gates, prohibiting students from entering or leaving. They also fired over twenty shots from inside, wounding Li Beiwu, the captain of the third company of the Public Security Bureau's Police Corps, and two policemen from outside the school. Captain Li's injuries were more serious, and they were immediately sent to Jiangwan Hospital for treatment. The Garrison Command, considering the rampant nature of a small number of communists among the students, has instructed the university authorities to hand over the communists who fired the shots immediately in order to maintain public security, and to persuade well-meaning students not to be exploited by the communists, to concentrate on their studies, and to prevent the situation from escalating.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council Correcting the Behavior of the Electricity Company <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Zhong Chunjie Was Forced to Sign, Requesting the Municipal Council to Provide Protection</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Settlement sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that, according to a letter from Zhong Chunjie Barber Shop at 799 Huade Road, on the morning of March 24th, the Shanghai Electric Power Company ordered people to invite me to the company for a discussion. I went to the office on Feilun Road before 2:00 PM that afternoon. There were two Westerners and a Chinese employee named Zhu at the scene. They said that the fire wire of my shop would be cut off. If I couldn't afford the fine, I could pay half to settle the matter, and ordered me to sign immediately on a paper slip written by a certain Wang from the company. While someone was reading the contents of the slip to me, there were sentences such as admitting to privately changing the lead seal. Although I do not understand either Chinese or Western languages, I refused to sign. Mr. Zai from the company then replaced it with another slip for me to sign, but did not read out the sentences, only saying that if I didn't sign, they would restrict my freedom of movement and send someone to cut off the fire wire at my shop, making it impossible for me to do business. At the same time, a Westerner raised his fist as if to strike. Fearing physical abuse and the inability to do business, I was forced to sign and leave. At that time, they declared that by the morning of tomorrow (March 25th), I must pay 47 silver dollars, otherwise they would still cut off the wire and I must not report to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association or publish it in the newspaper. I was subjected to this forced coercion and have no way to appeal, so I can only report the truth. I hope your association will quickly forward a letter to the Municipal Council to rectify the illegal actions of the company impartially. Furthermore, because I do not know either Chinese or Western languages, I do not know what the contents of all the above-mentioned sentences are. The document I was forced to sign under duress is completely invalid, I hereby declare." Upon investigation, legally exercising rights is the attitude that people under the rule of law should have. Even if there is an occasional emotional impulse and lack of control, one should admit mistakes in the face of the law when reason is restored. This is the great spirit of the Anglo-Saxon people and the maxim of the ancient Chinese philosophers, "do not hesitate to correct mistakes." Now, the electric power company has not only lost the spirit of the rule of law, but also tries to cover up its mistakes and even bully the weak, intending to interfere with freedom, threatening to cut off wires, and forcing signatures afterwards. Under the supervision of an impartial authority based on the rule of law, the company has engaged in such constant illegal behavior, which is extremely shameful. Accordingly, we request that your bureau severely correct the illegal behaviors of the Shanghai Electric Power Company in self-reporting, self-adjudicating, and self-executing, and stop all bullying actions in order to protect the legal rights and interests of taxpayers. Respectfully addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Settlement.</p>

<p>Over 100 Representatives from Various Organizations Attended</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Yang Weiyu, and others all gave speeches</p>
<p>Mr. Lin Aimin, the former manager of the Singapore Sin Chew Jit Poh, returned to China to serve at the invitation of various parties in the country and took the opportunity to inspect the Beijing-Shanghai area. The various public organizations in the city held a banquet at the YMCA last night at 7:00 PM to welcome him. Over 100 representatives and individuals from various public organizations attended. The details of the event are described below.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives</p>
<p>Representatives from public organizations included Zhu Bowen of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Ren Jinping of the Local Association, Ma Yinliang of Shen Bao, Lu Ganchen of the YMCA, Yang Weiyu of the China Vocational Education Society, Zhang Yuliang of the China Aviation Association, Xie Nanguang of the Fujian Association, Zhu Shaoping of the Chinese Global Student Association, Chen Zongshan of the China-South Cultural Association, Su Yaozhen of the New Yongding Construction Association, and Li Gongpu of the Liangcai Library. Individuals included Wang Xiaolai, Pan Gongzhan, Ma Chonggan, Sun Daosun, Liu Shimu, and Ma Gongyu, totaling over 100 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>First, Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the entire group, stating that Mr. Lin has devoted himself to the newspaper industry in Southeast Asia with great success, making a significant contribution to strengthening the national consciousness of overseas Chinese. His return to the country to serve, with his past experience and achievements, will undoubtedly make many contributions and add a unique color to the domestic press. I hope that Mr. Lin will maintain his enthusiasm for caring for the motherland, which he had when serving in Southeast Asia, and will not forget the overseas Chinese in order to make contributions to the country and the nation. On behalf of the entire group, I raise my glass to wish Mr. Lin a bright future and good health.</p>
<p>Mr. Lin's Reply</p>
<p>Mr. Lin then rose to reply, stating that he was extremely grateful for the welcome banquet hosted by the various public organizations and gentlemen tonight. I have lived in Southeast Asia for over ten years, and only recently returned from overseas. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly report on the situation of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. Over a hundred years ago, Southeast Asia was still a desolate land. Our overseas Chinese ancestors first ventured there to do business, enduring countless hardships before achieving today's prosperity. However, in recent years, the status of overseas Chinese has been greatly reduced. The global economic downturn is one reason, but the political environment of the location, which places restrictions on overseas Chinese everywhere, is the biggest reason. Currently, the Japanese are using their superior political and economic power to squeeze out overseas Chinese in all aspects. In the future, if the overseas Chinese themselves do not have a sound organization, they will inevitably find it difficult to resist. I sincerely hope that our government and farsighted compatriots will provide guidance and assistance so that our overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia can restore their past glory.</p>
<p>Founding a New Newspaper</p>
<p>Mr. Lin also reported on his future work. He stated that I and various friends have decided to create an ideal newspaper in South China, based on the principle of high quality, small quantity, and high sales, in order to connect the voices of China and Southeast Asia. Preparations have already begun, and it will be named the "Dahua Daily." It will be launched in three or four months. In addition, Mr. Ma Xiangbo advocated organizing a Southeast Asian Research Society to publish yearbooks and other publications on Southeast Asian issues. I have always been committed to cultural undertakings, so I have accepted the invitation and started preparations. This trip to Shanghai, in addition to inspection, is also to set up the headquarters in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang's Speech</p>
<p>Yang Weiyu, the representative of the Vocational Education Society, then gave a speech, stating that welcoming Mr. Lin has two more meanings. First, domestic compatriots have always admired overseas Chinese compatriots, and the contributions of overseas Chinese to the motherland have always been great. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution and the January 28th Anti-Japanese War received more support from overseas Chinese in terms of material and spirit than from the country. Overseas Chinese who provide material assistance are worthy of praise, but without cultural figures like Mr. Lin to advocate, how could this be achieved? Secondly, foreigners have always looked down on our country, slandering it as a culturally backward country. In their impressions, they believe that Chinese people only know how to do business and make money. With overseas Chinese cultural figures like Mr. Lin to promote, foreigners will have a new understanding of us, and understand the great personality and strength of our people, bringing honor and dignity to the country. The national achievements are much greater than those who only provide material assistance to the motherland. Subsequently, Li Chonghou, a professor at the College of Law and Political Science, and others gave speeches in succession. The event ended happily at about 9:00 PM.</p>

<p>Orders Have Been Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>Effective April 1st</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's combined water-land transport only involves the mutual connection of cargo with various railways. However, the passenger transport between trains and ships has not been realized due to various factors such as time and schedules. Since Cai Zengji took office, in addition to reorganizing the internal and external personnel of the bureau and reforming the systems of wharves and warehouses, he has also negotiated with the Nanxun Railway to launch a combined passenger transport service for the Nanxun Railway and Yangtze River ships. Both parties have reached an agreement, and the method will be temporarily based on the first passenger train departing from Nanchang to Jiujiang. Passengers from all stations along the Qianjiang River from Nanchang to Jiujiang who wish to go to Anqing, Wuhu, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai can connect with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's downriver ships. Passengers do not have to wait for ships when they arrive at Xun, wasting time. The Nanxun Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have agreed that every ship departing from Hankou to Shanghai will not leave the Xun port wharf until 1:00 PM after arriving in Jiujiang, regardless of whether there are connecting passengers. (That is, after the first train from Nanxun arrives in Jiujiang). Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, led by Deputy Directors Chen Zhaoji and Zhou Houkun of the Shipping Department and Director Shi Yixuan of the Business Department, issued an order to all Yangtze River ship captains and telegraphed the Nanxun Railway to comply. The combined passenger transport of trains and ships is the first record, which will be implemented on April 1st.</p>

<p>Effective April 1st</p>
<p>Pilot Program for One Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the Jiangnan Railway are connected at Yaohuamen Station to operate combined passenger transport. After both parties worked together to complete the construction of the connecting tracks and bridges, it was decided to implement it on April 1st. The existing Shanghai-Nanjing Railway's No. 4 upbound express train and No. 21 downbound express train will be used for the joint operation. Each party will provide one first-class car, one second-class car, one third-class car, and one baggage car. As the stopping time at the station must be at least seven minutes to complete the shunting work, the total travel time of the train will be extended by ten minutes. At the request of the Jiangnan Railway, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway will also add stops to the No. 3, No. 6, and No. 22 trains at Yaohuamen Station for the convenience of connecting passengers getting on and off, and will slightly change the departure times of each train. A pilot program will be implemented for one month first.</p>

<p>Disaster Victims Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young</p>
<p>The cries were heartbreaking</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 5:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out in the thatched shacks near Zhonghua Xin Road in Zhabei Gonghe Xin Road. Because the thatched shacks were entirely made of grass, once they caught fire, they spread rapidly and were unstoppable. Although the police officers from the Xin Zha Branch in charge immediately notified various fire brigades to rush to the scene, all the thatched houses were close together, making it difficult to extinguish. It was not until around 6:00 AM that the fire was extinguished. Over 100 thatched houses were destroyed, totaling over 200 households. When the fire was raging, the victims carried quilts and suitcases, supporting their wives and children, with a chorus of crying, which was heartbreaking. Afterwards, Liao Jiongren, the director of the Xin Zha Branch, sent police to take Sun Liu, an old woman from Yancheng who started the fire, to the bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 10:30 AM, Chen Xiaoma, a seven-year-old girl from the Chen Jinren family, who are immigrants from Jiangbei and live in a nameless thatched house near East Sports Association Road in Jiangwan, was scavenging nearby when she found a bomb in the bushes. At the time, Xiaoma did not know what it was, thinking it was a toy, and happily brought it home to show her mother, Chen Dong, who was 43 years old. However, Chen Dong also did not recognize it, thinking it was scrap metal. At that time, she was cooking rice, and she put the bomb into the fire. Before long, the bomb exploded, with a loud bang and flying shrapnel, injuring Chen Dong's left foot. Xiaoma's face and limbs were also seriously injured. Mother and daughter were immediately covered in blood and fell to the ground. Fortunately, the nearby police officers heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, and took the mother and daughter to the hospital for treatment. Their condition is critical.</p>

<p>Husband Believes She Has Committed Adultery</p>
<p>Files a Lawsuit in Court for Divorce</p>
<p>Wei Jiashan, a 36-year-old from Anhui, who lives at No. 33 Nianwu New Village, Fuxu Road, recently hired lawyer Li Ming to file a lawsuit with the Second Special Court against his wife, Sun (33 years old, also from Anhui), accusing her of adultery and suffering from an incurable disease, requesting a divorce and confirmation of custody rights. The lawsuit alleges that the plaintiff and defendant have been married for many years and have two children, Sheng Yuan, 12 years old, and Er Shan, 6 years old. In 1931, the defendant returned to her hometown from Shanghai and lived there. In May 1934, she left privately without telling anyone. It was not until December 13th last year that she suddenly came to the plaintiff's place and took Er Shan away, claiming that she would return to her hometown. After investigation, the plaintiff learned that she was working as a wet nurse in the home of a Mr. Liu. The plaintiff and defendant have not lived together for several years, and she is now working as a wet nurse, which clearly shows that she has committed adultery. Moreover, the defendant suffers from syphilis, which is in its third and most serious stage and cannot be cured. There is a risk of infection, and the affection between husband and wife has been severed. Therefore, a divorce should be granted according to the law. Yesterday, the court summoned the defendant, but she did not appear. Judge Chen instructed that the hearing be rescheduled. However, it is learned that Wei Sun has also hired a lawyer to file a civil lawsuit against her husband Wei Jiashan in the Second Special Court for abandonment, requesting alimony. The trial is expected to begin soon.</p>

<p>Chen Xuezhen is she a mute?</p>
<p>Sent to Forensic Institute for Further Examination</p>
<p>Chen Hongfu, a farmer from Yanjiachengjiao, Gaoqiao, Pudong, and originally from Chongming, was beaten and had two ribs broken on the night of the twenty-sixth day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, resulting in his death. The local court prosecutor's office detained Chen Huang, the wife of the deceased, and Lu Zhiliang, the uncle of the deceased's mother, on suspicion of being heavily involved in the case. According to witness Zhang Qianlang, Chen Hongfu was actually choked by Lu Zhiliang, with Chen Huang pressing down on his feet, and three other people using benches to beat him to death. He also stated that this testimony was based on the information conveyed by the deceased's six-year-old daughter, Chen Xuezhen, to their neighbor, the blind man Yang. Prosecutor Li Erfen examined the injuries on the deceased and found them to be consistent with the testimony. He also repeatedly ordered Chen Qiufu, the deceased's brother, to bring the girl Chen Xuezhen for questioning. However, Chen Xuezhen never arrived, leading to the belief that a public prosecution should be initiated. The criminal court held several sessions of inquiry without reaching a conclusion. The day before yesterday afternoon, presiding judge Cai Dingcheng opened the court for renewed trial. The details of the questioning have already been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that Judge Cai, considering the significant discrepancies in this case, summoned Chen Xuezhen for questioning. Surprisingly, Xuezhen remained silent throughout. When questioned, eight-year-old boy Chen Jinxiang stated that Xuezhen called him "second brother," leading to the deduction that Xuezhen was clearly not a mute. Therefore, it was ordered that Xuezhen be temporarily handed over to her mother, Chen Huang, to be taken to the detention center for care. Yesterday afternoon, a letter was sent to the police to bring Chen Qiufu, the deceased's brother, along with Chen Xuezhen, to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to examine the truth behind Chen Xuezhen's unwillingness to speak, and perhaps there are other hidden circumstances, and will be verified again.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Boatman Claimed to Leave Shanghai, Suddenly Returned Home to Catch Adultery <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Extorting the lover</p>
<p>The person was also detained</p>
<p>Wang A'yu from Ningbo, forty years old, previously married Pu A'mao (twenty-six years old), also from Ningbo, and lived together in the kitchen of No. 52 Chengqing Lane, Baille Road, in the French Concession. Wang worked as a boatman and was often away from home due to his work, which led to Pu not being accustomed to sleeping alone. Recently, she became acquainted with Cao Genbao (thirty-one years old, from Haimen, working as a chauffeur for Ren Xingqing at No. 262 Beller Road).  The husband, Wang A'yu, found out about this and returned home the day before yesterday, claiming he wanted to leave Shanghai because he had something to do. His wife was very happy. After dinner, Pu waited for her husband Wang A'yu to leave before inviting her lover, Cao Genbao, to their home for a secret rendezvous. At 5 AM the previous morning, Wang A'yu suddenly returned home, knocked on the door, and caught the adulterer and adulteress red-handed. Wang immediately attempted to extort 600 yuan from the lover Cao Genbao, but failed. In the evening, he reported it to the French police station, which ordered detectives to bring both parties to the police station. After the police chief learned the details, he ordered them to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police lawyer explained the situation and stated that the plaintiff, Wang A'yu, was also guilty of fraud and intimidation, while the defendants, Cao Genbao and Pu A'mao, were guilty of adultery. He requested an adjournment for further verification. When questioned, Wang A'yu stated, "Because my wife was demanded compensation from Cao Genbao, I dared not extort him." Cao Genbao testified, "I have been acquainted with Pu for over a year. Usually, because she didn't have enough money, I subsidized her monthly. Her husband first asked me to hand over 600 yuan, then reduced it to at least 200 yuan. I really couldn't afford it, so I was arrested." Judge Wang ordered an adjournment for thirty days for further verification.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Angry that His Wife Was Seduced, He Was Arrested for Seeking Revenge with a Gun <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Ji A'da Remained Bitter</p>
<p>Sun Genan Admitted to Seduction</p>
<p>Ji A'da (also known as Ji Zhubao), a tinsmith from Jiangyin, thirty-four years old, was found to be privately harboring two handguns at his residence at No. 165 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession in 1933, and was arrested by the French police station. He was transferred to the Shanghai Local Court, where he was convicted and sentenced to one year of imprisonment, and sent to prison. After Ji's wife, Tao, after her husband was imprisoned, was seduced by Sun Genan, the owner of the Xintai Tinsmith Shop at No. 1204 Xiaoshadu Road, Wuxi, and became adulterous, enjoyed frequent rendezvous and even</p>
<p>had a child</p>
<p>who has since died. However, this scandalous affair was discovered by Ji A'da in prison. Ji became extremely angry, believing that his imprisonment was actually a malicious setup by Sun Genan. Because Sun Genan wanted to seduce his wife, he had to find a way to frame him and harm him so that Ji would be imprisoned and could act as he pleased without any jealousy. Last year, after Ji was released from prison, he hated Sun to the bone, vowing to</p>
<p>kill Sun</p>
<p>and Sun also learned about the situation from his colleagues and had a sense of caution. Therefore, in addition to severing ties with Ji's wife Tao, he was also careful to guard against it. At about 10 AM the day before yesterday, Ji A'da went to the Xintai Tinsmith Shop alone to negotiate with Sun. At that time, Sun was still sleeping on the loft in the store. Shop assistants Xu Jinlong and apprentice Shen Huikang saw Ji arrive and, realizing his intentions were not good, immediately stopped him from going upstairs. They also reported to Chinese police No. 239, who came to arrest him. Ji also</p>
<p>fled in fear</p>
<p>but was later caught by the patrol police and taken to the Putuo Road police station. Under questioning, Sun Genan and shop assistants Xu and Shen suddenly claimed that Ji A'da had a gun in his hand when he arrived at the store. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to the Xintai Tinsmith Shop and found a gun and five bullets on Sun's bed in the loft. They then arrested Ji A'da. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, accusing him of</p>
<p>attempted murder</p>
<p>according to Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. He said that the defendant confessed in the police station that this was because his wife was about to give birth again, so he went to Sun to demand 100 yuan. The handgun was found when repairing water pipes in the French Concession one day, and it was old, so it was rubbed with sandpaper. The case still needs investigation, and he requested permission to postpone the hearing. According to Sun Genan, he has been having an affair with the defendant's wife for four years. The defendant also came to demand money and make trouble from time to time. If he didn't deal with it, he would kill me. Yesterday morning, I was sleeping in the loft when the defendant came upstairs with a gun, forcing me to settle the matter. I immediately got up and</p>
<p>grabbed his hands</p>
<p>and the gun fell on the bed. The shop assistants then called the police to arrest him. Xu Jinlong and Shen Huikang, the witnesses, also testified that they saw the defendant arrive with a gun. When questioned, Ji A'da stated that after I was arrested for the case, I was released on January 15th last year, and Sun seduced my wife at this time. On the 19th of this month, because my wife was about to give birth, I negotiated with Sun. Sun voluntarily subsidized 20 yuan, telling me to come to the store at 10 AM yesterday to collect the money. Therefore, I</p>
<p>went on time</p>
<p>but was arrested by the police. The gun was not mine, or Sun used his old tricks to frame me. Sun is cunning by nature, and everyone in the industry knows this, which can be investigated. Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the statements and ordered the defendant to post 300 yuan bail and be responsible for being available for questioning at any time. The case was postponed to the 30th for further questioning.</p>

<p>Inheritance Disputes Lead to Endless Litigation</p>
<p>Discovery of False and Fraudulent Deeds</p>
<p>After the death of Zhu Baoyuan, the owner of Zhenhe Tea Shop from Haining, all his inheritance was managed by his adopted sons, Yanqing and Shunqing. Zhu Baoyuan's married daughters, Zhu Jun and Zhu Meizhen, etc., had repeatedly litigated with their two brothers in the First Special District Court over the division of the inheritance, which was later settled with each receiving 80,000 yuan. However, Zhu Baoyuan's youngest daughter, Zhu Lizhen, also sued her brother Yanqing in the Haining County Court for forging a will. After investigation by the prosecutor, a decision was made not to prosecute. Subsequently, after mediation, she received property worth 80,000 yuan, the same as Zhu Jun and others. This was on September 8th of last year. However, Lizhen was only seventeen years old at the time, so in December of the same year, a custody deed was signed, stating that all property due to Lizhen would be temporarily kept by her two brothers until Lizhen came of age. Now, Zhu Lizhen, on the grounds that her brothers did not fulfill the deed, transfer the real estate, and obtained a letter from He Chongnan, discovered that the deed signed at the time was based on falsehood and fraud. Therefore, she hired lawyer Gao Danhua to file a complaint with the First Special District Court, suing Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing, requesting the cancellation of the signed property division deed. Yesterday, presiding judge Zhang Yuhai of the First Special District Court opened the Fourth Civil Court for questioning. The two defendants hired lawyers Zhang Zhengxue and Jiang Yiping for defense. First, lawyer Gao explained the process and presented He Chongnan's letter as evidence. Then, the defendant's lawyers argued that there was no so-called falsehood or fraud when the deed was signed. The plaintiff had previously been seduced and fell in love with a partner of the Zhenhe Tea Shop opened by the defendant. The plaintiff intended to marry him, but the defendant refused. The partner then instigated the plaintiff to sue for forging a will in the Haining Court, which resulted in no prosecution. After the settlement was reached, due to the restrictions of the custody deed, the plaintiff could not dispose of the property, hence today's lawsuit. Therefore, they requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. Judge Zhang, considering that the case still required investigation, ordered an adjournment for further questioning and ordered both parties to appear in court in person.</p>

<p>Factory Owner Yang Xinan Flees Without a Trace</p>
<p>Recent Three Months of Business Reached Tens of Thousands of Gold</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xu Shixun Was Ordered to Return to Jail Awaiting Sentencing on the 30th</p>
<p>Puda Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 73, Lane 432, Maybelle Road, specializes in producing various pills and liquids containing highly toxic substances, claiming to be brain tonics and selling them everywhere. Recently, after testing by the Nanjing Central Health Laboratory, it was found that the drugs contained a lot of morphine, which was enough to replace opium addiction. At this time of strict drug prohibition, such counterfeit drugs should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, the Shanghai Health Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which informed the First Special District Local Court, ordering the police to investigate the facts and dispatched detectives to the factory to</p>
<p>arrest employees</p>
<p>Xu Shixun and Yang Shouzhang, the nephew of the factory owner Yang Xinan (also known as Yang Jifang), seized more than 90 boxes of pills and liquids, and seven books of accounts from Puda and the Ruixin Pharmaceutical Factory formerly opened on North Henan Road, and sent them to the Special Court. Xu and Yang were ordered to be detained. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the seized drugs include 6 boxes of "Dwarf Gourd Pills," which have been verified by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department to contain 53% morphine, 12 boxes of "Annao Bupills,"</p>
<p>containing morphine</p>
<p>0.77%, 62 boxes of "Dwarf Gourd Extract," containing 31% morphine, and 18 boxes of "Annao Sleeve Juice," the toxic ingredients contained in them are considerable. In May last year, the factory's production and sale of the above-mentioned drugs were searched by the police, and the drug seller Liu was sentenced to imprisonment. Factory owner Yang Xinan fled without a trace at that time. Until recently, when Xu Shixun and others were arrested, they fled again. The police authorities, in addition to</p>
<p>strict investigation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Xu and Yang were sent to the court. Judge Liu Yugui interrogated them. First, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the circumstances of the case, saying that when Puda was searched last year, the criminals had confessed that Yang Xinan and Xu Shixun were shareholders of the factory. Xu Shixun now confessed in the police station that he had previously opened the Ruixin Pharmaceutical Factory and that "Annao Bupills" were produced by Ruixin, but this decision was also found in the Puda account books.</p>
<p>wrote Ruixin</p>
<p>It was found that from January to March 15 of this year, the amount of various drugs produced by Zuida reached more than 15,000 boxes, and its recent three months of business has reached tens of thousands of gold. They should be punished according to law to avoid endless harm. Xu Shixun admitted that he had previously opened Ruixin and said that he was temporarily staying in Puda because he was looking for a job. Yang Shouzhang said that Puda was</p>
<p>Uncle Yang Xinan</p>
<p>opened. Last year, it was sold to Yang Zhenyuan. He lived in Puda in order to read at night. The court asked him why he printed the Puda brand name on his business card since he was not an employee of the factory. Yang said that it was only for communicating with friends. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. The court then ordered Yang to be released on bail, and Xu was detained pending sentencing on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Jiangda Steamer Rescues Drowning Boatman at Huangshiji <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Two Civilian Boats Capsized by Huge Waves</p>
<p>Four People Rescued, One Frozen to Death</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River steamer Jiangda, was sailing from Hankou to Shanghai. On the way, it encountered a civilian boat capsized by wind and waves. It rescued four people and one was frozen to death. Yesterday, the ship arrived in Shanghai and reported to the Shipping Administration Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Civilian Boats Encounter Wind</p>
<p>The Jiangda steamer was sailing downstream near Huangshiji in Jiujiang when it encountered two civilian boats, which were traveling together with intertwined ropes, fully loaded with firewood and other items, traveling upstream. It was 3 PM at that time, and the wind and waves were very strong that day. One of the two boats was overturned by the wind and waves, and the other boat intertwined with it was dragged down and sunk. As a result, the two civilian boats capsized one after another, and all the boatmen fell into the water.</p>
<p>Jiangda Helps Rescue</p>
<p>After the boatmen of the two civilian boats fell into the water, they shouted for help in the water. At this time, the Jiangda steamer happened to pass by the area and heard the shouts. The ship immediately stopped and quickly released a sampan into the river for rescue. After various difficulties, all five boatmen who fell into the water were completely rescued. One of them had been in the water for a long time due to the cold weather and had already frozen to death when he was rescued. The other four were rescued.</p>
<p>Collecting Money for Relief</p>
<p>After the four rescued people were asked by the captain of the Jiangda steamer, they learned that the civilian boats were loaded with firewood from Anqing to the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Unfortunately, they encountered wind in the middle of the journey, and both boats capsized. Fortunately, they were rescued by the noble ship, but all their money, clothes, and belongings had been lost. How could they return to Anhui? The captain had a compassionate intention. In addition to providing them with clothes and food, he also solicited donations from various crew members and passengers on the ship, totaling seventy or eighty yuan, which was handed over to the four boatmen and sent to Jiujiang. The boatmen were instructed to disembark, and the donated money was used as travel expenses for their return to Anhui.</p>
<p>Almost Ran Aground</p>
<p>When Jiangda stopped to assist in the rescue, the area happened to be a shoal. After the civilian boats capsized, the river surface was also covered with the reeds they were carrying. Some of them were already rolled into the engine leaves of the Jiangda steamer. As a result, the movement of the ship lost its flexibility. Fortunately, the captain and chief engineer found a way to avoid retreating and removed the reeds from the propeller, which turned the danger into safety and prevented the ship from running aground. Yesterday, when Jiangda arrived in Shanghai, the captain had reported the matter to the General Bureau and the Shipping Administration Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Wang Shulou's Trial Record of the Major Robbery Case at the Post Office <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Wang Directly Admits Going to Robbery for the Booty</p>
<p>Jih Wears Monk's Robes and Still Tries to Evade</p>
<p>The major robbery and bloody case at the North Sichuan Road Postal Administration occurred on September 9th last year. Subsequently, the police arrested a group of men and women from Jiangbei, including Jih Rentang (also known as Wukong Monk), and sent them to the First Special District Court. Jih Rentang was sentenced to life imprisonment, Wang Chen and Jih Chen were sentenced to three years each, and Qiu Guobin was sentenced to two years and six months. Jih Rentang was dissatisfied with the sentence and appealed to the Second High Court, awaiting sentencing. The leader of the case, Wang Shulou (also known as Chen Yuren) from Funing, was still at large. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, at 1 PM, Chinese detective Huang Yufu and detective Pan Yunlong of the Yulin Road police station learned that he had been hiding at No. 7 Zhifu Road recently. They cooperated with Western detectives to secretly go to the address and arrest him. He was sent to the court for questioning and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi came to the Third Criminal Court to conduct a trial. Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu claimed that the two gangs were behind the robbery of the post office. One gang was headed by Zhang Lao Jiao, and the other gang was headed by the main offender Jih Rentang. He belonged to Zhang Lao Si's gang. They discussed the matter before the robbery, and the firearms were borrowed from a certain place in Jiangbei. Zhang Lao Si accompanied him to the post office to see the location. Then, they drank tea at the tiger stove on Linping Road, Zhabei. They had a car ready for the robbery, with a Li Jiao as the driver. Jih Rentang also went. At that time, they were carrying Mauser pistols and handguns. At about 9 AM, they saw the security guard and the old quartermaster who was carrying the banknotes in a hemp bag coming down from the building. The gang opened fire and robbed them. After the incident, they divided the spoils in a Jiangbei guild hall in a remote area of Qimei Road. He received 12,000 yuan. Later, he lived with a Jiangxi woman named A'xiang and fled to Nanchang. He came to Shanghai recently and was arrested. Now, Jih Rentang, Qiu Guobin, Wang Chen, and Jih Chen have been determined to be accomplices and have testified in the case. He asked for strict punishment according to law. Judge Jiang ordered the Wang criminal to confront the determined accomplices separately. Wang Chen said that at that time, he lived at No. 1227, Siwen Lane, Dongxinqiao. Wang Shulou and Jih Rentang had come to the place several times. Jih Chen said that he had also seen the defendant and Jih Rentang come to Wang Chen's place to discuss the matter. Qiu Guobin initially said that he did not know the Wang criminal. The court asked him to tell the truth, and he said that he had seen him at Wang Chen's place. Jih Rentang, wearing a monk's robe, said that he did not know the defendant at all, hoping to reduce his crime in the appeal. He testified cunningly. When questioned, Wang Shulou confessed without denying. He said that he had received 9,000 yuan, and his lover A'xiang had taken 3,000 yuan, which he had spent. At that time, he had divided the spoils in the Jiangbei guild hall. Zhang Lao Jiao had received 230,000 yuan, and Jih Monk had received 34,000 yuan. Two groups went to the post office to rob, and there were more than a dozen accomplices. Judge Jiang appointed lawyer Lin Yingqing to provide free legal assistance to the defendant, and then ordered Wang Shulou to be returned to prison for a scheduled sentencing. It was noon when the court adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Notifies Opium Smokers to Exchange Second-Term Smoking Cessation Permits <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>From April 1st to the End of May. Failure to Register Within the Deadline Will Result in Permit Cancellation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau will process the exchange of second-term smoking cessation permits, starting from April 1st and ending on May 31st. Failure to register within the deadline will result in the cancellation of the first-term permits. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>The case of exchanging permits for the second term on April 1st. In accordance with Article 9 of the Regulations on Strictly Enforcing Smoking Cessation and Suppressing Opium Users, the limited-term smoking cessation permits must be exchanged every six months. The registration of opium smokers in this city began in July 1935 and ended in December. The limited-term smoking cessation permits issued in the first term at the end of December are about to expire and must be exchanged to comply with the law. With the approval of the Municipal Government, the bureau will begin the exchange registration on April 1st. All opium smokers who have registered and obtained permits at the bureau and its various sub-bureaus must go to the sub-bureaus and teams in their respective areas to register for the permit exchange procedures starting on April 1st. Those who do not register by May 31st will have their old permits invalidated. Hereafter, smoking opium without a permit will be considered private smoking without a permit and will be sent to military tribunals for prosecution and punishment according to law. Do not delay and bring trouble upon yourselves. As for the first-term smoking cessation permits, a small number of opium smokers either registered under false names or borrowed the addresses of others, which aroused the suspicion of the investigators, who considered them to be using counterfeit permits and arrested them. Although they were released after verification, they were subjected to a short period of detention. Although this was their own fault, their situation is somewhat understandable. In order to make the registration more accurate, opium smokers are allowed to apply for changes if the names, occupations, ages, and addresses they previously reported do not match those listed in their household registrations. After the police have verified the facts, the changes will be made. In addition to the notice, the following are the instructions for exchanging smoking cessation permits. Please abide by them and do not violate them. This is a special notice.</p>
<p>Instructions for Exchanging Limited-Term Permits</p>
<p>The registration date for the second-term permit exchange is from April 1st to May 31st of this year. Failure to register within the deadline will result in the invalidation of the first-term permit. The bureau has obtained approval to not increase the burden on opium smokers. The fee for exchanging ordinary limited-term smoking cessation permits is still 5 yuan, and the fee for exchanging limited-term smoking cessation permits for the poor is still 6 jiao. Opium smokers must submit their first-term permits and second-term permit fees to the bureaus and teams in their respective areas during the permit exchange registration period to apply for permit exchange registration and report their accurate names, ages, birthplaces, occupations, addresses, and other items. After the bureaus and teams that handle the permit exchange have verified and registered the information, they will issue temporary receipts for safekeeping and temporary use. Opium smokers who have registered for the permit exchange must bring their temporary receipts to the bureau or team where they registered to exchange for the official second-term permits within half a month after registration. Opium smokers who hold first-term registration receipts must go to the bureau or team where they originally registered to exchange for the first-term permits and then apply for permit exchange registration in accordance with the procedures.</p>

Gao devoted himself to art and the national revolution in his early years. He served as the chairman of the Tongmenghui and the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Allied Forces in 1911. Since the founding of the Republic of China, he has retreated to devote himself to the art movement. He went to various countries to promote Chinese painting. Last year, he held a solo exhibition in Beijing, which caused a sensation. Central University specially hired him as a professor, but he was unable to take the position due to illness. Recently, Central University repeatedly urged him, so Gao came to Shanghai with his illness to go to Beijing. The Shanghai literary and art community will hold a grand welcome.</p>

<p>Family Still Unaware</p>
<p>Sun Jinshui, a 22-year-old native of Shaoxing, resides in the Houganfang area of Junli, Shaoxing. His father's name is Sun Fengshan. Sun Jinshui has been working as a traveling salesman at the Nanyuan Dananhuo Store, number 38 Laiyi Wharf, for many years. He has generally been diligent and conscientious. However, starting around November of last year, he suddenly changed his ways, spending lavishly. As a result, he embezzled funds from the store, amounting to over 554 yuan. He also pawned a bicycle belonging to the store for 20 yuan in national currency, spending all of it. The store owner eventually discovered this and entrusted lawyer Fang Junjie to report the matter to the Dongjiadu Police Station according to the law. Sun was arrested and transferred to the local court. Judge Wu Zongyu concluded the trial and sentenced him to six months of imprisonment. The store owner's accompanying civil suit was also ruled in his favor, with Sun ordered to pay a total of over 574 yuan in compensation. After the sentence was handed down, Sun, aware of the irrefutable evidence against him, immediately entered prison to serve his term. However, his family, residing far away in Shaoxing, remains unaware of his arrest and imprisonment, or that he requires rescue.</p>

<p>3.  Shanghai Rice and Grain Dealers Association: This association was founded in the winter of the sixth year of the Republic of China (1917) by the former Shanghai North and Shanghai South Rice and Grain Dealers Association and a portion of the kebang (merchant group) vendors. The association is located at the intersection of Guangfu Road and Changan Road in Zhabei. Rice and grain dealers are called "maitou" (sellers) in the industry, similar to the brokers who handle the buying and selling of miscellaneous grains and steamed buns. However, its organization is complete, its power is great, and its business is stable, far surpassing the miscellaneous grain brokers who only seek small profits. There are a total of fifty to sixty people in the industry, all operating as individuals, divided into gangs based on the region of the rice and grain producing area: including Changbang (Changshu), Xibang (Wuxi), Xianbang (Jiangyin), Kunbang (Kunshan), Libang (Liyang), Danbang (Danyang), Chengbang (Changzhou), Subang (Suzhou), Nanbang (Songjiang, Wujiang area), Wanbang (specializing in Anhui goods), Jiangbei Gang, and Sanbang, which has little cargo coming. In the past, the Shanghai North Dealers Association had greater power because cargo was concentrated in Zhabei, and rice distributors were mostly in the North. However, distributors in the North mainly specialized in rice distribution, unlike businesses in the South, which mostly used foreign rice as their main commodity. However, in recent years, the rice businesses in the North have declined, and rice wharves have been established in the South, and the power has tended to shift to the South. The dealers are no longer divided into Shanghai North and Shanghai South. Fan Hesheng had the most prestige in the association in the past. After Fan's death, Jiang Shizhi, Zhang Songtao, and others have become slightly well-known. The current chairman of the committee is Zhang Songtao. The association's funds were initially donated by each member, but later a small fee was added to the sale of rice. In addition, there are similar groups, some of which have been merged into the association, and some of which are newly created. Here is a brief description:</p>
<p>I. Changzhao, Nanbang, Beibang and other public offices: Before the establishment of the Rice and Grain Dealers Association, the Changzhao Public Office, Nanbang Public Office, and Beibang Public Office were already established. The Changzhao and Nanbang Public Offices occupy a considerable position in the industry. Other groups of rice merchants stationed in Shanghai, sometimes called public associations or public offices, are also called federations. Its constituent members are nothing more than dealers, mainland rice merchants, vendors, self-purchasing ship owners, carrier ship owners, and those related to the above. Those who were established earlier have been registered, and those who have been organized in recent years have not gone through legal procedures. This is because there may be points of conflict with the registration regulations of the trade association.</p>
<p>II. Shanghai South Rice Transporters and Merchants United Association: This association is temporarily organized and consists of rice shipping households, transporters, and a portion of the dealers. It is often seen in newspapers in the midst of rice price disputes. At that time, it was initiated by the Tonglibang (i.e., Nanbang) vendors and shippers, and then invited other gangs to join, and with the support of powerful people, the power expanded. However, those in the industry who are knowledgeable and afraid of trouble avoid it, because some actions have occurred that have aroused social disgust and criticism. Although it is gradually proceeding on the right track, it has not yet been registered due to internal organizational defects.</p>
<p>III. Shanghai North Rice Transporters and Merchants United Association: The organization of this association is the same as the Shanghai South United Association, and it has not been established for long. It was also promoted by the Shanghai South United Association. Most of the organizers are dealers and few are ship vendors.</p>
<p>4.  Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association: This association has been established for a long time and was reorganized from the Jiagutang Rice Industry Association. Jiagutang was established in the year of Xushen (1908) during the Guangxu period of the former Qing Dynasty. It was first called the public villa and then the public office. In the year of Gengxu (1910) of the Xuantong period, it was renamed the Jiagutang Rice Industry Association. At that time, only 148 North and South counterparts joined the association. After the civil movement broke out in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), there was also a new organization of rice merchant people in the industry, the Rice Industry Merchant People's Association, which stood opposite Jiagutang. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929), the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce ordered the merger, and it was reorganized into the Shanghai Rice Shop Trade Association. The association is located on Danfeng Street, Xinkaihe, with branches in both the North and South cities. The current chairman of the committee is Lu Wenshao, and there are about 1,000 members, which is six or seven times more than before. The association occupies an important position in various industry associations in the city, because it has many members and is related to people's food. The Jiagutang of the rice shop industry and the Rengutang of the rice industry have their own organizations and are not mixed. Outsiders regard them as one, but in reality, they are not. The so-called rice shop is a retail store that uses sheng and dou (measuring units); the rice business is a wholesale business, buying and selling in bulk, using hu (another measuring unit), obtaining a brokerage license from the government, directly purchasing goods from cargo owners in various producing areas, adding commissions, and reselling to rice shops. Rice shops cannot wholesale directly from kebangs, etc., and must agree with the distributors and pay a considerable commission before they can implement it. This is the major difference between rice shops and rice businesses. However, among the distributors, there are those who also operate retail sales, and among the shop merchants, there are also those who also operate wholesale sales; because they are all members of the above two trade associations at the same time.</p>
<p>5.  Trade Organization of the Flour and Bran Industry</p>
<p>I. Shanghai Flour Mill Trade Association: This association was established during the late Qing Dynasty and was originally named the Shanghai Machinery Flour Company Association. The reason why it had the word "machinery" was to distinguish it from the old-fashioned mills that were still in use at the time. The manufacturers also had the name of a machine-made flour company. In addition to all the factories in Shanghai, the factories in Wuxi were also affiliated with the association. At its peak, there were more than 30 members. However, recently, there are only Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Shenda, and Maoxin and Jiufeng in Wuxi. The Yutongxiangxin and Erchang factories have long been leased and operated by Fufeng. Huafeng has been closed for a long time and is currently seeking takeover. Since Xinda closed down last year, it has now been leased by Fufeng and operated by Zaoji. Zhonghua also closed down last autumn, and the Xinji (Lida) factory, which Xin Da once rented, has not yet been taken over. Therefore, there are currently only about 20 members in the association. The association is located on Xinkaihe, Minquan Road, and the chairman of the committee is Rong Zongjing. The association once formed a Wheat Office with rice and grain distributors and established branches in the mainland. However, it seems that the association's affairs are currently suspended.</p>
<p>II. Su, Zhe, and Wan Mainland Flour Mill Trade Association: This association, abbreviated as the Mainland Flour Association, was founded in the first year of the Republic of China (1912) and was organized by factories in the mainland of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The association is located on Baker Road, and the current chairman of the committee is Cai Jiansan. It is undeniable that the mainland factories' assets and output are not as good as those of the Shanghai factories, and they are scattered in various places and are not easy to contact. Their status is not as important as that of the Shanghai Factory Trade Association, and the association's organization and management are not as sound as those of the Shanghai Association. However, most of the factories in the mainland maintain it. Among the more famous factories, such as Datong Yangtze in Nanjing, Baoxing and Xinfeng in Bengbu, Baoxing in Xuzhou, and Yixin in Yanhu, Hengfeng and other factories in Changzhou, have been reorganized once or several times.</p>
<p>III. Shanghai Flour Exchange Brokers Association: This association is a part of the Flour Exchange organization. The office officially opened on January 11th of the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920). The quota of flour brokers is 55, which cannot be increased or decreased at will. The restrictions on qualifications are very strict, and they must be reported to the Ministry of Industry and approved by the office before they can be changed. The purpose of the Brokers Association is to promote the business of all brokers on the one hand and to assist the development of the entire transaction on the other hand. The president system was initially adopted, but later changed to a committee system. Yang Jinchen and Zhu Jiansheng are the chairman and vice chairman of the association.</p>
<p>The staff of the Shanghai Flour Education Institute formerly organized the Shanghai Flour Exchange Members Association. This is similar to the nature of a trade union, specializing in contacting feelings and mutual assistance and protection, which is different from a business group. Later, internal disputes occurred in the association and it was automatically dissolved.</p>
<p>IV. Shanghai Bran Trade Association: This association was formerly known as the Bran Association. It is not a group of manufacturers and distributors, but is organized by bran brokers who are in the nature of dealers. In the past, when the organization was formed, it was based on individuals and was initiated by more than a dozen people including Shen Chunjiang, Weng Xiaoting, and the late Zai Mingfu. Later, it gradually expanded and changed from individual units to business names. Many soybean, rice, and miscellaneous grain firms that also operated bran joined the association. Flour business names and brokers in the Miscellaneous Grain Flour Exchange also participated. Therefore, its power is quite strong. Moreover, brokers in this industry are different from brokers in other industries. Most of them have abundant assets and operate on a large scale. The internal organization is similar to that of business names. It was just that individuals came forward in the beginning, so they changed their names to business names. Also, due to the different industries, it is divided into two factions: one specializes in Dongyang Zhuang (Japanese goods), and the other specializes in mainland goods; however, most of them operate in both. The address of the head office is in Cotton Yangli, Dou City Street, and the branch office is located in the Shanghai Flour Exchange. The former chairman of the committee, Mr. Shen Chunjiang, passed away this spring, and Weng Xiaoting was elected by the industry to preside over it. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Hu Zuyin</p>
<p>2.  A Glimpse of the School Buildings</p>
<p>In the international environment of Shanghai, the buildings of the school are able to express the color of American school architecture. The buildings are surrounded by green lawns, and the interior is mostly luxurious, which can evoke the aesthetic sense of visitors.</p>
<p>Office The office faces Avenue Petain and is the largest building in the school. The first floor houses the offices of various departments, a portion of the elementary school classrooms, and the woodworking classroom. The second floor houses the secondary school classrooms, the auditorium, the library, and the chemistry, physics, and home economics laboratories. Although there are a few classrooms on the third floor, most of them are used as offices for student extracurricular activities, such as the student publishing house, the Girl Scout troop headquarters, the student sports department, and the student self-government association.</p>
<p>Elementary School Building In the northeast corner of the school, there is a building dedicated to young elementary school children. Inside are the kindergarten and first-grade classrooms, and outside are playgrounds and two exercise fields for young children to play.</p>
<p>Dormitories There are two dormitories, one for boys and one for girls. The boys' dormitory was completed in January 1933 and is divided into two parts, one for junior high school students and one for senior high school students. The first floor of the dormitory houses the living quarters of faculty members with families and a faculty lounge. The first floor of the girls' dormitory is used as a sickroom, a physical examination room, and a clinic.</p>
<p>Dining Hall and Music Room The first floor of this building has a music room, piano rooms, and practice rooms, all separated by solid walls and double glass doors, as well as a student lounge, laundry room, and storage room. The second floor houses the student dining hall, kitchen, and faculty dining hall.</p>
<p>Gymnasium and Covered Playground The gymnasium has a basketball court, male and female shower rooms, locker rooms, and a physical education instructor's office. There is also a covered playground, which was built in September 1933. The covered playground has a novel design, with a wall facing north and ventilation on the other three sides, which is in line with the principles of outdoor activities.</p>
<p>Sports Field The school grounds are spacious, and various sports fields, such as football fields, lacrosse fields, and tennis courts, are fully equipped. Recently, a new quarter-mile-long running track has been completed, which can be considered the best running track in Chinese schools.</p>
<p>Other Buildings The water heater room is located behind the dining hall and provides hot water and heating for the entire school. There are also cloakrooms, toilets, water towers, pumping rooms, bicycle storage rooms, plumber's room, school worker's dormitory, campus guidance office, and gatehouse scattered throughout the school.</p>
<p>Administrative Organization According to the school's regulations, the school's administrative power is concentrated in the hands of the principal, who is responsible for all school affairs. However, according to the school principal's repeated and sincere statements, although he has the power of absolute discretion, he exercises his power in the spirit of democracy. In terms of organization, the principal is assisted in handling school affairs by a registrar, a business manager, division supervisors, and male and female dormitory supervisors. The registrar is similar to the academic affairs director in Chinese schools and is also responsible for smaller disciplinary matters. The business manager is responsible for the cleanliness, procurement, and accommodation of the entire school. The division supervisors assist the principal in supervising teaching. The male and female dormitory supervisors are responsible for guiding the boarders in the male and female dormitories and handling matters that occur in the dormitories. All faculty and staff hold monthly meetings to make decisions. The faculty and staff meeting is not an administrative meeting but a research meeting, where all faculty and staff discuss teaching issues and exchange research ideas. Other committees meet irregularly, and the matters they recommend must be approved by the principal before they can be implemented.</p>
<p>Financial Income and Expenditure The school's budget for this year is 300,000 yuan. In terms of income, tuition and miscellaneous fees for the whole year amount to 250,000 yuan, accounting for five-sixths of the total income. Therefore, the tuition fees paid by the school's students are quite high; the exact amount varies depending on the grade level and whether the student is a day student or a boarder. The remaining 50,000 yuan is freely donated by American community groups and expatriates in Shanghai. The school has 500 students this semester, representing 370 families. Assuming that there are 1,000 students throughout the year, representing 740 families, the average cost of education per student per year is 300 yuan, and the average cost of education borne by each family for their children per year is 400 yuan. However, according to the school principal's report, the actual average cost of education per student per year and the average cost of education borne by each family for their children per year are not as high as these figures, because a portion of the 300,000 yuan in total annual expenditures is board and lodging fees for boarders, which should not be included in the cost of education. In terms of expenditures, in addition to board and lodging fees for boarders, faculty salaries account for 70% of the remaining total expenditures. The remaining operating expenses and equipment costs are all spent according to the budget.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Qu Qiu Bo, Xu Chengji, Wins Three Straight Sets Against Carson <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Six to Three, Six to Three, Six to One. Leaves Shanghai for France on Italian Mail Steamer This Afternoon</p>
<p>Xu Chengji, the representative of our country in this year's Davis Cup tennis team, is scheduled to leave the country on the Italian mail steamer Victoria this afternoon. The Chinese Tennis Club specially invited Xu and Carson to play a singles exhibition match at the club's tennis courts on Singapore Road yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM. Xu defeated Carson three to one the day after his arrival in Shanghai. It was expected that Xu would win again yesterday. The result was six to three, six to three, and six to one. Xu won three straight sets.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji Six…Three Six…Three Six…One Carson</p>
<p>Both Sides Perform</p>
<p>Because it is not tennis season, they lack practice, so both of them do not seem to be at their best, especially Carson. In the first set, both sides played casually, with very little excitement, and the shots were not as steady as usual. From the beginning of the second set, Xu Chengji gradually got into the swing of things. Xu's wonderful shots began to appear under his racket. Carson also tried his best to follow, but every time he failed to achieve what he wanted. The third set was the most exciting part. Xu's forehand diagonal heavy draw was often effective, and he often used feints to distract Carson, who was overwhelmed. The referee's occasional mistakes yesterday also reduced their interest somewhat.</p>
<p>Match Situation</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Xu Chengji shot smoothly, and Carson struggled hard, with several draws. Carson finally won the first game with eight to six. Xu then pulled back a game, and Carson won the second game again. In the fourth game, Carson suddenly became successful and won with a slide. In the sixth game, it was Xu's turn to serve, and he returned the favor in the same way. After that, the competition between the two sides was very fierce. Xu won two consecutive games, and as a result, won the first set with six to three. In the decisive set, Carson still won the first game first, and Xu tied the score and won the third game with a slide. After each side scored two games, Xu continued to draw and press, and quickly ended the second set with six to three. At the beginning of the third set, Carson was already showing fatigue, while Xu became more and more courageous. The volley and diagonal long shots made Carson run around. Carson only won the second game, and the whole game was controlled by Xu. Xu sailed smoothly and won five consecutive games, winning again with six to one. At this point, Xu had won two consecutive sets. The two sides shook hands and stopped fighting.</p>
<p>Leaving the Country This Afternoon Xu is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the Italian mail steamer Victoria at 11:00 AM this afternoon. The ship is berthed at the China Merchants Third Wharf. Lin Baohua and his wife, who are traveling to France at their own expense, will be traveling with him. Cai Huiquan returned to Hong Kong the day before yesterday to take care of personal matters and will wait for Xu and others to pass through Hong Kong before traveling to France on the same ship. Another Davis Cup player, Zheng Zhaojia, will cross the Atlantic directly from the United States and meet Xu in France.</p>

<p>Thirty-Seven to Twenty-Six, Chih-Chih Takes Third Place. Championship Final Rescheduled to Later This Week in Zhenru.</p>
<p>The third Jiangda Men's Basketball game was originally scheduled to be held at Zhenru Rushui Electric Road yesterday afternoon. The match with Fudan, the outcome of which was related to the championship, was one of the most exciting scenes in the Jiangda competition. However, Fudan suddenly had a special event, which prevented the players from leaving the school to participate in the match. With the approval of the association's committee, it was rescheduled to 3:00 PM on Saturday (the 28th) this week and will still be held at Jiaoda. Yesterday, fans, attracted by the fame of the two teams, went to Zhenru to watch the game. In order to reward the audience's enthusiasm, the Jiaotong University authorities temporarily invited the Patriotic Girls' School basketball team to play a friendly match with the Jiaotong University girls. As a result, the Patriotic team won Jiaotong University with twenty-one to thirteen. In another Jiangda game, Chih-Chih defeated Guanghua with thirty-seven to twenty-six. Chih-Chih had two losses and one win, winning the third place. Guanghua had three losses in three games, ranking last. As for the champion and runner-up, it is still up to the Jiaoda-Fudan match to be resolved later this week. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e168">Chih-Chih Wins Over Guanghua <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Start of the Battle Chih-Chih Takes the Lead</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Guanghua took the lead. After three or five rounds, Chen Qiheng broke out from the crowd and made a shot, opening the scoring. Chen Qiheng added to the score on the middle line, and the long shot hit the target again, taking the lead. However, Chih-Chih was not willing to show weakness. Chen Yunwan received assistance from Zhang Jiaqi, raised his arm and shot from afar, and immediately retaliated. Zhou Cheng circled the field at the baseline and suddenly jumped up, also making a contribution and creating a tie of four to four. After that, the situation was extremely tense, with you coming and going. After six to six and eight to eight, Chih-Chih changed its strategy and gained momentum. Chen Yunwan, He Zheng, and Zhang Jiaqi hit three shots in three, and the score soared, taking the lead by fourteen to eight. Guanghua then resisted forcefully. Zhou Hongyi and Pan Weichun contacted and attacked, each scoring a goal. Before long, the first half ended, with Chih-Chih taking the lead with fourteen to twelve.</p>
<p>Counterattack Ineffective Guanghua Suffers a Miserable Defeat</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, Chih-Chih transferred Lin Qiming to serve as left guard, Zhou Cheng changed to serve as left forward, replacing He Zheng, and Guanghua also transferred reinforcements Wang Jipei to the field to assist. Wu Baolin was able to retire. The two sides then began to fight again. Guanghua's Pan Weichun ambushed under the basket, received the ball from Zhou Hongyi, and made a contribution under the basket, opening the scoring again. Chih-Chih's Chen Yunwan, seeing his position being trampled on, was unwilling to give up, and immediately made a great contribution. From then on, the entire Chih-Chih army contacted and performed brilliantly. Lu Zhou Zhang successively hit the target, and the score plummeted. Guanghua only scored three points with one shot and one penalty by Zhou Hongyi. The score was sixteen to five. At this point, Guanghua was cautious and tried hard to avenge itself, and there was indeed a major turning point. Pan Weichun, Wang Jipei, and Dong Shuzhao shot repeatedly, and the score was extremely close, at fourteen to eighteen. Unfortunately, Guanghua's strength was insufficient, and Chih-Chih took the opportunity to counterattack. At the end of the second half, it was defeated again with fourteen to twenty-three. As a result, Chih-Chih won with a total of thirty-seven to twenty-six. The lineup is as follows:</p>

<p>Result: A Decline of $1.90</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw an excess of sellers from defaulting accounts. Although abundant, it was difficult to rally. The exchange rate hardened, with multiple parties in disarray. Supply exceeded demand in the market, resulting in a drop of $1.90, marking a cumulative decline of $1.90. Early morning saw a rise in the British silver market overseas, with rumors from brokers stating Chinese sales and some Indian purchases were observed according to the postings.

<h3 id="e177">Public Bonds: May Bonds Launch Today <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange only traded April bonds for one month. The May futures will be allowed to be launched early today. However, only types A and B of the May futures have remaining ballots. Types C, D, and E do not have a lottery draw period within May. Therefore, the price of the May futures will clearly be different. Because these five types of unified public bonds were issued at the same time, the lottery draw months are uneven due to different terms. However, the Ministry of Finance has not yet announced the matter, leading to speculation that the five types of public bonds will be unified in the May 10th lottery draw. What will happen in the future remains to be seen. However, according to the regulations, the principal and interest are repaid every six months, and since the bonds were issued in February, the first principal and interest should be paid in July. Trading was sluggish again yesterday. Only number 35 sold within the market, so there were transactions. Other than number 11 having a slight purchase of 100, most were retail transactions. It is expected that trading will remain difficult to be lively temporarily after the May launch. Yesterday's market price hovered between 5 fen and 1 jiao, failing to escape this narrow range. Transactions were still extremely scarce. Today's transaction volume was only 425,000 yuan in the morning. The market price also only saw 5 fen and 1 jiao high and low. Here is a table comparing the results of the ups and downs: (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>The yarn market was calm, with the situation showing slight fatigue. Because the March yarn was the last day of trading, the market was threatened by the ample new delivery chips, and suffered setbacks.

However, this month was the last day, and the market discussion stated that deliveries were sufficient and sentiment was soft. But as the banking sector prepared to accept all deliveries, the market tightened and rebounded by 4, 5, and 6 jiao. The third session saw the market entering a fatigued state again due to quiet spot yarn trading. As a result, the current month rose by 5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and the distant month rose by 1 jiao. The afternoon opening saw the market more firm in the current month where the short positions were severely pressured, and the distant month declined. Subsequently, Osaka Sanpin yarn gradually declined, and the decline was fierce, affecting sentiment. As a result, each month fell by 1, 2, 5, 6, and 9 jiao compared to the morning closing price.

<p>Continued Decline Due to Arrival of Indian Cotton in the Future</p>
<p>The cotton market initially rose and then fell, with the market condition being normal.

<p>Marked Cotton Rose by 4 Jiao This Month Alone</p>

Indian cotton rose by 0.5 to 1 rupee, but the April contract was extremely firm due to enthusiastic buying, jumping up by 3 jiao. The distant month rose by 2 or 3 jiao. The second and third sessions saw the market falling back down due to the yarn market's weakness and the Osaka Sanpin cotton market's sluggishness. As a result, each month rose by 5 fen to 1.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, but the current month rose by 4 jiao due to hedging on the receipt of goods. The afternoon opening saw the current month market being quite firm, while the distant month was flat and weak because Sanpin cotton gradually declined.

<p>Existing Wheat Inventory Not Abundant, Continuous Rise of 2 Fen</p>
<p>Flour Market: After the morning opening, the various months of the market uniformly exhibited a decline. Foreign wheat quotes showed Chicago good at approximately 2 jiao and Canadian small at 4 fen. The market sentiment was due to the Shanghai festival on the previous day and the exceptionally good weather. According to custom, this is related to the wheat harvest. Therefore, sentiment turned lax, and the bearish atmosphere prevailed. Long positions were continuously selling off, so the near term was down a small amount, and the distant term was down 2 fen. By the afternoon opening, trading remained active, and the market slightly stabilized. Due to the gradual decline in market sentiment, floating shorts were also taking positions, so the market did not continue to fall. However, industry insiders observed that if the weather remains sunny, the market should be expected to weaken slightly.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Market: After the morning opening, the various months of the market exhibited a stable near term and a declining distant term. The delivery of this month was approaching, and the spot market was not abundant. Short positions were taking positions, so market sentiment was good. From June onwards, because it was the third day of the third month of the lunar calendar, good weather caused distant customers to sell off significantly. The market uniformly sharply declined, falling by 3 to 5 fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the current month continued to be good by 5 fen due to short positions thinking of covering. The trading of June and onwards was slightly quiet, and the price was similar to the morning. It is observed that if the weather does not change, the market may continue to weaken. The spot wheat market was good by 2 fen again due to the small existing inventory. 2,300 packages of Shandong wheat were quoted at 5 yuan, 3 jiao, and 2 fen, and were handled by Fu and Liang firms.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the various groups arrived from over ten sources (approximately 4,000 shi of goods in total). Late rice accounted for 12 or 13 sources. However, the sales market in this street was dull, and Bao and Xiao from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other groups handled over 3,000 packages in total. Therefore, although the arrivals were sparse, the market conditions were difficult to see improving. Late rice was unremarkable, and thick japonica rice was similar to the previous day. Early Nanyang rice saw even fewer transactions, and the price depreciated by nearly 1 jiao. North Ocean sharp and overcast yuan were settled.</p>
<p>Arrivals Never Cease, Hoarders Depreciate Prices to Sell</p>

<p>Yesterday's customer rice market condition saw arrivals never ceasing, and hoarders continued to sell off, causing the market to continue to soften. The various ports along the Yangtze River and the roads of Eastern Zhejiang continued to load goods, especially the merchants who hoarded rice last month. Because the weather is turning good, the international situation is stable, and there is hope that foreign rice will continue to be determined. Therefore, they want to sell off early, and many are depreciating prices to settle. Therefore, the market gradually declined. Fortunately, Quanzhou absorbed Jiangxi and Hunan machine rice, and this street continued to handle business, so the market was able to stabilize. However, the bone marrow was still flat, soft, and lifeless. Throughout the day, 2,350 packages of Jiangxi rice, 200 packages of Hunan rice, 800 packages of Shaohan unpolished rice, and 300 packages of Hunan rice were opened.</p>

However, because Chunchun was less than 10 yo packages on the matter, there were occasional inquiries at Xichang car shops, so this fall is also unknown. Yesterday, a total of 1000 packages of Luohe beans and 200 packages of Bangcheng beans were opened. The door of the Du bean Sand Yellow Taiwan street oil continued to be not , and the transaction was more than 1200 packages of each bean, and the bean turned up by 34 points .</p>

However, Heongxi green tea and Indian sales have seen slight sales. Yesterday, Meishen, Ruixiang, and other firms purchased over 400 boxes, and the market price was made at 17 yuan. In addition, the flower and fragrant end pieces of red and green tea also had sporadic sales in store villages.</p>

The premium for lively colors has opened to 31 yuan and 5 jiao, the ordinary ones are kept at 30 yuan, and the thick colors are sold at 28 or 9 yuan. According to the continuous opening, approximately 30 or 40 barrels have been opened, and most of them have been purchased by battery factories.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Zheng Chenggong <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— He Guang</p>
<p>When we mention Zheng Chenggong, we must first talk about Zheng Zhilong. Because if there wasn't such a shrewd and capable father to train him and cultivate him, Zheng Chenggong probably wouldn't be the Zheng Chenggong we are mentioning now.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhilong was originally a pirate. He was righteous and generous, and eager to help others. Therefore, he was very different from ordinary pirates.</p>
<p>He made friends with many righteous people and robbed ships on the seas around Fujian. Later, his influence gradually grew, and the government troops couldn't do anything about him. The Ming Dynasty also knew that this hero could not be subdued by force. So, they changed to a gentle approach and recruited him, appointing him as the General-in-Chief of Fujian.</p>
<p>Once Zheng Zhilong became the General-in-Chief, he began to improve the maritime security. However, at that time, Taiwan was occupied by the Red Hairs—that is, the Dutch. Chinese pirates ran to them for protection. So, it was impossible to eliminate them. Zheng Zhilong was extremely angry at this situation and immediately mobilized his navy, personally leading the charge. A mighty fleet sailed towards Taiwan to fight the Red Hairs.</p>
<p>When they went into battle, his soldiers all fought with the strength of a hundred men each, bravely advancing forward. However, the Red Hairs' weapons were very powerful: they were all cannons and guns and things like that. The Ming soldiers had never seen anything like this before and were immediately flustered. They trampled on each other, and the formation was in great disarray. The Red Hairs took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, defeating Zheng Zhilong severely. He had no choice but to flee back to Fujian.</p>
<p>Every time Zheng Zhilong mentioned this crushing defeat, he would grind his teeth and consider it a lifelong regret. He often said to his son, "Chenggong! Remember this defeat and strive to take revenge in the future!"</p>
<p>Although Zheng Chenggong was a child, he understood his father's meaning and vowed to avenge him.</p>
<p>When he grew up, he was indeed braver than his father and also resourceful. So, he led troops to attack Taiwan. No matter how fierce the Red Hairs' cannons were, he was not afraid at all, and he charged forward, leading by example. When the soldiers saw that their commander was risking his life like this, who would dare to retreat? They all charged forward like fierce tigers. Once they got close, the cannons became useless. A fierce melee ensued, and the Red Hairs were utterly defeated and fled in disarray. —These are all Zheng Chenggong's later great achievements. Now let us talk about his patriotic actions at the end of the Ming Dynasty!</p>
<p>During the late Ming Dynasty, the country was in chaos, and bandits rose up everywhere. Li Zicheng marched from Shaanxi to Beijing. Emperor Chongzhen hanged himself on Coal Hill. Wu Sangui, because Li Zicheng's general Liu Zongmin seized his beloved concubine, asked the Qing troops to quell Li Zicheng. But after the rebellion was put down, the Qing troops refused to leave and completely occupied the Ming Dynasty's territory. As a result, all Chinese people became citizens of a conquered nation. But the will of the people did not die, and they rose up one after another to establish the descendants of the Ming Dynasty as emperors: there was Prince Tang in Fujian, Prince Fu in Nanjing, and Prince Lu in Zhejiang. It was most heartbreaking that they could not unite themselves and instead fought for the throne. Therefore, they were completely destroyed by the Manchus using a strategy of divide and conquer.</p>
<p>At that time, Zheng Zhilong was under Prince Tang. After Prince Tang was defeated, he was captured by the Qing troops and imprisoned in Beijing. Zheng Chenggong was greatly saddened by this tragic situation of national subjugation. He vowed to restore the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>He gathered many troops and occupied the coastal areas, preparing to build a foundation for a northern expedition.</p>
<p>Zheng Chenggong realized that the many defeats in the past were due to the lack of training and strict discipline of the troops. So, he actively trained the army and navy. Whenever he had time, he would give speeches to the soldiers about the great righteousness of the nation, telling them that the country did not belong to the emperor, but to all the people, and that everyone should take responsibility for saving the country. Therefore, his soldiers all loved the country and the people. In addition, rewards and punishments were clear, and no one under him disobeyed him. He could truly be called having strong soldiers and brave generals.</p>
<p>He called himself the Loyal Earl Grand General of Pacification. He occupied Xiamen, renamed it Siming Prefecture, and the headquarters of the Grand General of Pacification was located here.</p>
<p>At that time, the descendants of the Ming Dynasty occupied Guangxi and were known as Prince Gui. Chenggong further allied with him, and their influence became even greater. Countless heroes from all over the world came to join them, drawn by their reputation. Seeing that his foundation was solid, Zheng Chenggong launched a northern expedition.</p>
<p>At this time, the Qing court had already stabilized the situation and was in the process of rewarding meritorious officials. So, they were completely unprepared. Zheng Chenggong used swift and decisive tactics to march straight from Fujian to Zhejiang, as if entering an uninhabited land. In a few days, he had already reached the territory of Jiangsu. He took Guazhou, broke through Suzhou, and marched straight to Zhenjiang. He was invincible wherever he went.</p>
<p>After these several major battles, Zheng Chenggong knew that the Qing army had a lot of cavalry, and it would be somewhat disadvantageous to fight them with infantry. He then devised a plan: he specially trained a team of soldiers, having them wear iron clothes, hold short knives, lie on the ground, and specialize in cutting the legs of cavalry horses. With this strategy, the Qing soldiers simply couldn't cope and fled at the mere sight of them. Therefore, Zheng Chenggong came to Zhenjiang smoothly.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang was an important town on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Its western side was Nanjing. After occupying Zhenjiang, Zheng Chenggong moved his troops westward and besieged Nanjing. Once Nanjing fell, he could cross the river northward and drive straight in, who could fear he wouldn't be unstoppable?</p>
<p>On this day, Zheng Chenggong was preparing to attack the city when suddenly a messenger-like person came and said to him, "Marshal! We have wanted to surrender to you for a long time, but our families are in Beijing, and we are afraid they will be implicated. If we surrender a month later, it won't matter much. Will the marshal agree to us?" Chenggong was hesitating, and his generals all said, "Nanjing is already like a fish in a pot, is it possible for it to run away? Marshal, agree to them!" Chenggong was originally a magnanimous person, and after hearing these words, he readily agreed. Little did he know that this was their delaying tactic!</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. On the 29th, Zheng Chenggong distributed lamb and fine wine and generously rewarded his soldiers, preparing to enter the city the next day.</p>
<p>In the evening, the soldiers were all drunk and returned to camp to rest. Who knew that disaster would strike at this time?</p>
<p>It turned out that reinforcements had arrived and had already made arrangements with those inside the city to attack from both sides. When the Zheng army woke up from their dreams in shock, how could they have the ability to resist? They scattered and fled, looking like a complete mess.</p>
<p>Zheng Chenggong was heartbroken. The plans he had worked so hard on for several years were ruined in an instant due to a moment of carelessness. When would such achievements be able to be restored? How could he not be heartbroken and sad?</p>
<p>But he was, after all, a person of strong will and was not discouraged at all. After retreating to Xiamen, he reorganized the remnants of his army: eliminating the old and weak and replenishing them with strong men. He crossed the Taiwan Strait to Taiwan, drove away the Red Hairs, and occupied Taiwan. Firstly, to make it an overseas base, and secondly, to avenge his father's defeat and fulfill his long-cherished wish. —As for his battle against the Red Hairs, it has already been mentioned earlier, so there is no need to mention it again here.</p>
<p>After Zheng Chenggong occupied Taiwan, he revitalized industry, developed mineral resources, and founded education. In a few years, he had governed it into a place of strong soldiers and wealthy people. However, his heart for restoring the Ming Dynasty never faded. However, at that time, the Manchus' power became increasingly prosperous, and in addition, the generals under him secretly surrendered to the Manchus. Therefore, Chenggong not only could not attack the Qing Dynasty, but would instead be attacked by the Qing Dynasty. Even so, Chenggong built strong fortifications, and the Qing troops could only sigh in vain!</p>
<p>Zheng Chenggong still used the Ming Dynasty's reign title. Unfortunately, he soon passed away! Later, it was passed down to his grandson Zheng Keshuang before being destroyed by the Manchus. At this time, it had been more than thirty years since the fall of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Kan</p>
<p>In the early 19th century, there was a middle-aged leather craftsman in France who often hid alone in the dark and sighed. One day, a charitable old man noticed him. The old man saw that he was poorly dressed and assumed that he must be worried about poverty, so he intended to help him and sincerely asked him, "Friend, please forgive my intrusion, what difficulties do you have? Can I help you?" When he heard the old man's words, he quickly stood up and bowed respectfully to the old man. His face was red, and he couldn't speak for a long time. The old man saw that he was an honest man and assumed that he must have an unspeakable secret, so he felt even more pity for him and said, "Friend, just tell me the amount you need." He knew that the old man had misunderstood him, so he had to tell the real reason and said, "Sir, thank you! Although I am poor, I don't want money. I hate that I am old and uneducated, and too useless! I am troubled here because I want to find an opportunity to study, but I can't find it." When the old man saw that he was so eager to learn, he was very respectful and promised to teach him himself. He took the old man as his teacher and never sighed again. He got up before dawn to make leather and finished his work early to go to the old man's house to study. He often studied until late at night and was reluctant to come back. He often forgot to eat dinner. Because he worked so hard, he naturally made progress very quickly. In less than a year, he could study on his own without a teacher.</p>
<p>At that time, he lived in Arblis and was already the father of four children. His wages were very low, and a family of six lived a very hard life. The workers in the same situation as him sent their children to the factory as child laborers. Some people advised him to do the same, but he declined, saying, "I believe I am a useful person, but unfortunately I am uneducated and have wasted my life. How can I bear to waste my children's lives? I would rather eat one meal and starve one meal than let them go to school." He really ate one meal and starved one meal, saving money to send his children to school to pay tuition. He also took the time out of his busy schedule to teach them the words he knew. Because of his hard work, he ended up making his fourth son, Louis Pasteur, into one of the greatest scientists of the 19th century. Most other scientists can only provide convenience to mankind, but his invention saved the lives of all mankind.</p>
<p>Pasteur was a very ambitious child. He saw that his father worked so hard to send him to school and was very grateful. He vowed to become a great man to repay his father. Therefore, he studied especially hard. He was a famous good student at school. In 1843, Pasteur was already 21 years old. One day, he said to his father, "Dad, you have worked hard for decades. Your son is now grown up and should share some of your burden. He shouldn't just let Dad work and his son study." Soon, he was admitted to the Paris Normal School, where he worked part-time and studied part-time. His father was afraid that he would overwork himself and often wrote to advise him, "Son, great talents are often late bloomers. Don't be anxious. Working too hard will harm your body. You must get enough sleep every day and don't forget to exercise. Because only with a healthy body can you do great things."</p>
<p>Pasteur listened to his father and paid attention to his health and self-cultivation. He knew that competing with others for scores in the examination hall was harmful and useless. He didn't care about this and concentrated on doing scientific experiments in the laboratory. He was very patient and meticulous, using a long time to gradually prove the truth through trial experiments. Many students who were eager for quick success and superficial understanding laughed at him for being useless and gave him the nickname "the pillar of the laboratory." Only his friend Chappuis understood him. Chappuis often said to those who ridiculed Pasteur, "You are blind. You will know what kind of person Pasteur is in the future."</p>
<p>Pasteur didn't care whether people praised him or scolded him, he only knew how to work hard. He liked to study crystallography very much and gradually experimented with the truth. In 1848, the Minister of Public Education recommended him to Strasburg as a professor of chemistry. There he met a lady who loved science, and they got married that year. After the wedding, he asked his wife, "Love, where should we go on our honeymoon?" His wife replied sincerely, "What place is more suitable than the laboratory!" She gently kissed Pasteur's forehead, with a few points of shyness in her eyes, and said in a low voice, "Love, I love to see you working in the laboratory." She closed her eyes, recalling and continuing, "Your face is full of enthusiasm, your eyes are shining, you are seriously facing the crystal in front of you, whether it is a meticulous experiment or a deep consideration, I can see the joy in the depths of your heart... and there is more, but it may not be possible to describe in words. Love, in short, you are in a laboratory, like a fish in a deep pool, both happy and beautiful!"</p>
<p>Pasteur was encouraged by his wife and worked harder, spending all his honeymoon time in the laboratory. Now his work was making amazing progress day by day, and he couldn't let go of it more and more, so he simply experimented day and night. Sometimes he came back too late and saw his wife waiting for him with a candle, he felt a little sorry and smiled to comfort her, "Love, I will soon have an unprecedented great invention. Please be patient for a while, I will soon be able to make you famous." Sure enough, soon after, because of his successful research on winemaking, the French government awarded him the honorable Legion of Honor, and also appointed him as professor and dean of the Lille Science Society.</p>
<p>At that time, the whole world believed that "things must rot first, and then insects are born," and no one knew how to prevent external microorganisms. Therefore, germs bred everywhere, and I don't know how many people died in vain. Even contemporary scientists, the director of the Rouen Museum, Pouchet, also believed that microorganisms are transformed from dead matter into living ones, and are naturally generated in artificial air and oxygen. However, Pasteur had already seen that this "theory of spontaneous generation" was wrong when he studied yeast. He advocated that "things must first have insects (i.e., microorganisms), and then rot." He believed that there must be many microorganisms in the air that cause substances to rot. So he worked hard to do an experiment to overthrow this "theory of spontaneous generation."</p>
<p>During his vacation, when he had time, he took dozens of bottles, each containing a substance that was easy to rot. He put them in groups in different regions. After a few days, he took the bottles back. He found that of the 20 bottles placed on the mountain road near his hometown, 8 had rotted; of the 20 bottles placed on the mountain, 5 had rotted; of the 20 bottles placed on the ice sea, only 1 had rotted; of the 20 bottles placed in a crowded lecture hall, all had rotted. Later, he did another experiment. He took two bottles containing easily rotten liquids, used high heat to kill the microorganisms in the liquids and bottles, and then opened the bottle mouths to let air into the bottles. As a result, the next day, the liquid in one bottle rotted, and the liquid in one bottle was as fresh as ever. It turned out that in the bottle that did not rot, before it was heated, Pasteur devised a way to bend the bottleneck so that air could enter the bottle, but the microorganisms stopped at the bottleneck. Without microorganisms causing trouble, the liquid inside did not spoil. He repeated the experiment again and again, and it always worked. Everyone then believed that what made substances rot was indeed a microorganism—bacteria; if it was isolated, the substance would not rot.</p>
<p>He used his new invention to prove that germs can invade the living tissue of the human body, so surgery must be absolutely clean, and the equipment used must also be disinfected. Based on his principles, he also invented vaccination. After Pasteur's germ theory became popular, Western medicine made great progress, and the number of people who died in vain in the world was greatly reduced.</p>
<p>At that time, French industry was declining sharply, but suddenly it was revived, all thanks to Pasteur's invention of winemaking and silkworm disease prevention methods. Huxley said, "The income from one invention of Pasteur is enough to compensate for the indemnity of the Franco-Prussian War of 1871 by more than 5,000 trillion francs."</p>
<p>Pasteur's father lived to a ripe old age. He saw his son's great inventions succeed one by one with his own eyes. Usually, when his son was doing experiments, he also learned from his son. Therefore, his knowledge also increased with age. In his old age, he could not only understand his son's knowledge, but he himself became a scholar.</p>

<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>The call for "universal education" has been around for decades, but until now, the lack of universal education in China remains the same. Precisely because universal education is advocated but education is still not universal, some overly clever people have begun to suspect that Chinese characters are too difficult. Thus, the promotion of simplified characters began, followed by the promotion of Romanization. On the surface, those who advocate simplified characters or Romanization may have some reasons, and some current periodicals have already applied these simplified characters. However, as an author, I am ashamed to say that I cannot recognize a few simplified characters. On the contrary, I encountered considerable obstacles when reading. Therefore, I often have the following feelings: People who have received higher education are certainly not confused. They only need to read the simplified character table several times to remember it. However, knowing two ways of writing a character is not without a sense of "busybodying." For people who are just learning to read, many problems will arise. First, if you only read simplified characters, then even a simplified character dictionary is not available. Isn't it as difficult as climbing to heaven to look up a character? Second, if people who are roughly literate want to read more kinds of books and newspapers, it is definitely not enough to only know simplified characters. Then they still have to understand the original font. Third, the structure of Chinese characters originally has its own certain rules, and those who have dabbled in the field of philology are very familiar with it. Simplified characters are not like that. They are the vulgar writing of business circles in various places. Because the font structure is chaotic and there is no certain standard, it is difficult for scholars to remember. Therefore, the promotion of simplified characters may seem to be conducive to universal education on the surface, but in reality, it adds another layer of difficulty. As for the Romanization of Chinese characters, there is no need to say more. You must know that China's ability to nurture within the same cultural sphere, despite its vast territory, large population, and complex languages, relies on the unification of this writing system. Now, advocating Romanization means first destroying all the hard work of the past thousands of years in the field of writing. And relying solely on the phonetic Latin script to make all Chinese people able to write and understand it, isn't this a dream? For example, a Latin script spelled by a Suzhou person cannot be understood by a Changzhou person, let alone a Hangzhou or Nanjing person. This is not so much helping China's universal education as it is an attempt to destroy Chinese culture. Therefore, the author believes that the reason why education in China has not been popularized is not because there is a problem with the writing tool, but because the work of promoting universal education has not been vigorously advanced. No matter how simple and easy something is, if you don't put in a little effort and hope to succeed without any effort, there is absolutely no such legendary truth in the world. The same is true for the anti-illiteracy movement. The slogan of "universal education" has been shouted for decades, but it is only shouted, not done. As a result, despite decades of complaining in magazines, newspapers, and publications, China's illiteracy will not be eliminated by one person. Since last year, the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Movement Committee launched the literacy movement, and after only half a year, although there is no formal work report, according to internal staff of the committee, about 120,000 illiterate people have been eliminated. This proves that the work of universal education is not in saying but in doing. Promoting this work will always have a way, always have an effect, and always have hope. Not promoting this work, but stealing and tricking to advocate simplified characters and Romanization, then the work of universal education will always be hopeful.</p>
<p>Since we understand that the key to this literacy movement is not in talking but in doing, it is not enough for only those responsible for the literacy movement to do it. You must know that after reading for two or three months and knowing one or two thousand characters, you may be unexpectedly successful and achieve remarkable results when you are learning, but once you leave school, after half a year or a year, you may still forget everything and become illiterate again. Why? Because there are too few opportunities to apply it. It is not enough to read general newspapers and periodicals. It is absolutely impossible to rely solely on the opportunity to write letters or write accounts. If you always read this literacy textbook, you will never review the old and know the new. Some people may say that children's reading materials can be given to people who are just learning to read. In fact, it is also impossible because the content of children's reading materials is often created in accordance with the psychology and physiology of children. A story for children to read will definitely not be of interest to adults. Therefore, the author believes that in today's world where the government authorities are working hard to promote the literacy movement, the publishing industry should do its best to assist. How to assist? Taking Shanghai as an example, it is to provide 120,000 newly eliminated illiterate people with suitable and good reading materials, publish a periodical, or publish a set of common sense books. In short, taking these newly eliminated illiterate adults as the target, using the one or two thousand characters they know, work hard to compile various essays, stories, novels, etc. If it is a periodical, then of course you can insert many current affairs materials. This kind of publication has two advantages: illiterate people who are studying can use it as extracurricular and supplementary reading materials, and graduates can increase their reading opportunities and avoid wasting their studies.</p>
<p>If the publishing industry can lower its pricing and improve its content, then on the one hand, it can assist this literacy movement, so that it can achieve more practical results, and at the same time, it can obtain a wide range of readers. The author firmly believes that if only 120,000 illiterate people have been eliminated in a corner of Shanghai, there can be at least 12,000 copies of sales. If we cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Movement Committee, then through the publicity of the principals and teachers of the literacy schools, the extent of its sales will be far more than tens of thousands of copies.</p>
<h3 id="e197">The Publishing Industry and the Reading Community <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Zhuang Xin Zai</p>
<p>It's time for a rectification movement</p>
<p>To say that the Chinese publishing industry is an exaggeration. In reality, China only has book selling.</p>
<p>The publishing industry is indeed aimed at the reading community, but the publishing industry cannot be like the Parisian perfume market, purely catering to general modern tastes.</p>
<p>The so-called problem with the Chinese publishing industry is that the reading community does not improve due to the inducement of the publishing industry. On the contrary, the publishing industry falls by catering to the tastes of the reading community.</p>
<p>What kind of embrace does the Chinese publishing industry have for readers? In order to grasp the general low-level tastes of readers, absurd and obscene novels and notes such as "The Strange Adventures of ××" and "The Karma of ××" are filling the Chinese publishing market. And 70% to 80% of periodicals use comics, witty sketches, and short essays as the backbone. Looking back at the contribution of the publishing industry to the reading community, it is naturally taking the revamped and largely similar textbooks of various levels as the center of profit. In addition, piecing together and reprinting some kind of series, some kind of complete works, some kind of selected works, and so on, after messing around, they are still these old things with new wine in old bottles. The May Fourth Movement introduced some basic knowledge of science and brought some modern superficialities. The New Literature Movement, without selection, chaotically published some colorful poems and novels. Following that was the social science movement, which contributed the undigested and half-understood ABCs of Marxism and books such as the Outline of Social Science. This is still an exaggeration in terms of the bright side. As for competing to compile test question answer keys and scrambling to reprint ancient books with several discounts, the former guides young students to cheating and opportunistic methods, making them unwilling to put in hard work for in-depth research in academic research, and the latter's selection is inclined towards low-level tastes. The poor printing and many errors in proofreading are not worth mentioning. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Yang</p>
<p>The new peace plan signed by the four countries of England, France, Belgium, and Italy was announced simultaneously in London and Paris on the 20th. It consists of nine articles, the most important of which are: "Condemnation of Germany's unilateral abolition of international obligations; The Locarno Treaty remains effective; The area within 20 kilometers east of the border between France and Belgium will be guarded by international troops." In presenting this new plan, the four countries also clearly knew that Germany would not accept these conditions. However, they first opened a price to see how Germany would counteroffer.</p>
<p>Although Germany's reply has not yet arrived, based on what Hitler has expressed and the domestic opinions in the past two days, it is clear that it is far from the issue. The German chief representative, Ribbentrop, told British Foreign Secretary Eden that "Germany cannot accept any proposals to resolve the Rhine problem if it cannot enjoy equal treatment." Hitler said in a speech in Jena that "the German nation is now seeking complete autonomy. We will never give way to any concept that attempts to threaten us. The Treaty of Versailles is like a tombstone, only enough for mourning and not enough to be the cornerstone of a new world order." An important figure in the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs said more ridiculously on the 21st, "This document is based on the spirit of the Treaty of Versailles. When politicians gathered in London yesterday, they almost got the date wrong, thinking they were still 17 years ago." According to the above statements from various important German figures, Germany may not be willing to counteroffer at such a price. Even if they do counteroffer, it must be a high price and a low payment, without any doubt.</p>
<p>Does this mean that this deal will definitely fail? No. Britain knew early on that Germany would not accept such conditions. Therefore, British Prime Minister Eden said again yesterday that "everything in the Locarno plan is just a suggestion from the four countries. If Germany proposes another plan to maintain the overall situation during the interim period before a new solution is reached and can gain the agreement of the four countries, it may be changed." The meaning is, our asking price is like this, if you want to counteroffer, as long as we can make back our costs, we can sell at a loss to attract more business. Also, on the 21st, London newspapers unanimously revealed news of opposition to the draft four-power agreement in the British House of Commons, allowing the temporary stationing of international troops on the German border. The regulations on the military and political obligations borne by Britain. From this point of view, the so-called new plan established by the four countries will not only be unacceptable to Germany, but it is not even consistent within itself. How can it achieve any effect? I did not expect that the so-called high-minded European diplomats would be so reckless, not only failing to see the momentum of Germany, but also failing to see the world situation. Japan's invasion of China and Italy's attack on Abyssinia, although there was a time when the international community made righteous speeches, soon disappeared without a trace, and there was no way to correct them. Now, Germany is demanding equal treatment and reclaiming its own sovereignty, but they want to desperately contain it, which is not only clearly unfair, but also contrary to reason. Moreover, sanctions against Germany are neither easy nor possible. It can be seen that the methods of European diplomats are just so-so. Therefore, for the sake of the four countries, the only thing to do is to ignore the established facts and the broken treaties, and re-establish a new collective security plan, which is necessary.</p>

<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the sun shone high on the wall, displaying a solemn and tranquil atmosphere amidst the hustle and bustle. As a result, the small alley began to liven up; this small alley, in its outward simplicity, perfectly reflected the status of the more than twenty households living in it: shop assistants, rickshaw pullers, small clerks, clandestine workers... all those who were forgotten by the world, abandoned by the golden laughter of the metropolis, crowded, jumbled, in this dirty and simple housing without sunbathing lawns and dance halls, living day after day in these days of suffering and anxiety...</p>
<p>The small alley in the early morning was lively: men successively rushed on the road to labor in the busy life. As a result, women gathered by the public tap, washing some vegetables, washing some clothes, talking about other people's and their own trivial matters, venting some resentment and sorrow about life: cursing, sighing...</p>
<p>Children cried and ran all over the alley, and the adults frowned: "That kind of life, that kind of days!"</p>
<p>So, someone pointed to the third back door, as if revealing a treasure, and said to an old woman washing rice beside her: "Look, at A'Mao's house, the man has lost his job, and he wants to die all day long. He cried all night again yesterday! The couple cried together, making us unable to sleep well all night, really... alas, really..."</p>
<p>"In this day and age, living is not a joke. If it is—"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the back door of the "A'Mao" house that had been pointed at was suddenly opened as if it had been hit by a storm, and a sharp, anxious cry shot out like an arrow, pulling all the people's eyes over; people stared blankly at the low door frame with a curious and sighing mood. All the sounds were also temporarily quiet, and in the silence, someone said in a low voice: "Look, this kind of life, this kind of..."</p>
<p>The sharp cry still pierced straight into everyone's ears and hearts. Then, like a madman, the young wife of "A'Mao" suddenly rushed out of the house, crashing like a mad beast, and even the tone of crying became a terrible roar.</p>
<p>The women went to hold her, surrounded her, and some people listened with great interest, like reading an interesting picture story.</p>
<p>"A'Mao... he swallowed opium and died! These days... how am I... going to live... die! Die! God... God..."</p>
<p>"What? A'Mao is dead?" The voice was surprise and terror.</p>
<p>"You have to report it. It's suicide, not a joke."</p>
<p>The voices suddenly became chaotic again, and many people walked into the low door to climb up to the dark loft to see. The dead person lay on the bunk, with a terrible dark face: "So pitiful, still a young person, these days..."</p>
<p>Others were arranging for the young A'Mao's wife: comforting her, or donating a little scarce money...</p>
<p>So, someone went to report to the bureau. The bureau came with a corpse cart and policemen, and quickly carried the corpse away, and called the living person to ask some questions. "The past is the past", everything is over...</p>
<p>At noon, people began to cook again, all the disturbances had calmed down, and this small disturbance had completely passed. The small alley was deathly silent, restoring its original appearance. Only some dark and sad shadows remained, unconsciously appearing and disappearing in some people's hearts.</p>
<p>"Life is so terrible."</p>
<p>However, in fact, just like all ordinary things, after a few days, this small disturbance that had already passed was gradually forgotten...</p>

<p>— Bai Ling</p>
<p>That was a long, long time ago, when I was still in Qingdao. Once, I was sent by a women's group to a small village in Sifang, not far from the island, to do some work. Accidentally rushing out of the city, my nostrils, which had been suffocated by coal smoke, immediately felt a new sensation: the spring fields sent me a fragrant smell of yellow soil.</p>
<p>I walked forward along a small path covered with green grass. At that time, there was really a kind of heartwarming taste that made me laugh uncontrollably. Although it was not far from the city, everything reflected in my eyes was already something from another world. I walked into a small village, and my eyes were filled with some lovely and simple people. Because I wanted to know their living conditions, I did not ask for anyone's permission, so I rushed into a dilapidated small family in a busy and lively manner. The door was so low that I had to bend down to enter. This family was just eating lunch, which was: sweet potato dried porridge, and sorghum noodles made into steamed buns. They asked me to sit down in a friendly manner, so I sat down happily at the table where they were eating. The woman in the family looked like a widow, and there was no man in the house, only five boys and girls of different ages. Among them were three older girls, who were so thin that they didn't look like human beings at all. I once asked the oldest one, who was fifteen or sixteen years old, "What do your sisters do at home"?</p>
<p>She said in a low voice: "No. We all work in factories".</p>
<p>Her words made it unnecessary for me to ask any further questions, so:</p>
<p>"Are you all in one factory?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm in the Dakang Yarn Factory, which is opened by the Japanese. My two sisters are in the British Tobacco Company."</p>
<p>"What do you all do?" I asked again.</p>
<p>"There's no good work to do in the factory! Isn't it just suffering to the extreme! I'm in the spinning room. They are in..." Just as she wanted to continue, her two sisters interrupted and interjected in unison: "We shred tobacco for others".</p>
<p>After talking about some other things, I asked her again: "Is your foreman female or male? Is he strict?</p>
<p>She pouted and said: "He is a terrible male guy. That thing always bullies us female workers. He likes to drink alcohol. Once he gets drunk, he loses his temper, or he goes to the pretty female workers to say bad things! We've really had enough of it! Alas, what can we do."</p>
<p>"How much do you get paid every day?"</p>
<p>She smiled, showing hesitation, and said: "It's not the same. Um, it's too little. I only get two dimes a day after counting."</p>
<p>At this time, a woman's urgent call came from the family next door: "Sister Chunmei, have you finished eating? Let's go."</p>
<p>This one who was called Chunmei was the girl who was talking to me. After being called, she quickly stood up, wiped the corners of her mouth with her hand, and said to me with a smile: "I'm really sorry, we're still waiting to go to work, I can't talk to you anymore.</p>
<p>As she walked out of the gate courteously, I asked the two little girls sitting next to me, "What about you two"?</p>
<p>The two girls looked at me with gloomy eyes, and then looked at her, but they didn't say a word to me after all. At this time, her mother opened a sad mouth and said slightly: "Alas, neither of them has a job. One was sick for half a month and just got out of bed. One was rejected by the foreman's inspection, saying that she was too young and couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>My heart fell heavily into a shadow.</p>
<p>The woman said again: "That's why the older girl can bring money home every day to support us. We also rely on her. These short-lived ghosts, their father died early..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman around thirty years old ran in from outside the gate. She opened her mouth wide and laughed loudly: "Chunmei's mother, you don't have to call Chunmei to work anymore. Don't you know that Wang Gui's Liu Jie in the west is crying at home. She just ran back from the factory. She said that she didn't get a job today and was tricked by a foreman to go to the mountain. Um, um, the child's clothes were also torn! It is said that she was beaten by the foreman in the end, and she vomited blood from her mouth..."</p>
<p>This wildfire-like news burned my heart.</p>
<p>However, within a few minutes, this small village was immersed in miserable crying. Oh, Wang Gui's daughter, who had been ravaged by the foreman, finally sacrificed in the hands of violent forces.</p>

<p>— (Blow)</p>
<p>The four countries of England, France, Belgium, and Italy signed a new peace plan. The full text of the agreement was announced simultaneously in London and Paris. The general idea of ​​the new peace plan is not to pursue the established facts of Germany, but to prevent future wars. Tan Lao San said, "It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep are lost," but after all, the sheep have already been lost, but it is indeed better than not being able to mend the fold after the sheep are lost.</p>
<p>The British Foreign Secretary declared that he would strive to rebuild European peace, stating roughly that the infantry squads of the Locarno Public Kingdom, formed into an international army, should be stationed on the borders of France, Germany, and Belgium. During the negotiation period, Germany should be responsible for not increasing the garrison in the Rhine. Tan Lao San said that the German army has already been stationed in the Rhine region. How can it be withdrawn and allow international troops to be stationed? Germany has stationed troops in the Rhine. So how can the increase or decrease of troops be limited? Foreigners like to sign blank checks, mostly like this.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Blind Singer <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>On that long sandy road, he used that thin bamboo cane every day, knocking on each sandy strip, step by step, along the wall of Zhang's courtyard. Although his eyes were blind, he was very familiar with this road; not only familiar, he remembered very clearly which sandy strips were laid on this road, which ones were broken, and that there was a small bridge at the end of Zhang's courtyard.</p>
<p>In the summer, the scorching sun hung in the sky like fire, shining beads of sweat on his forehead, and a stench permeated his dirty and tattered shirt and trousers. But he still passed through that long sandy road every day as usual, walking into every village and every alley -</p>
<p>In winter, the northwest wind blew, and snowflakes fluttered. Although he only wore a thin, tattered cotton-padded jacket given to him by others, and his body trembled in the northwest wind like a vibrating string, he still passed through this long sandy road every day, walking into every village and every alley.</p>
<p>He was a lonely, blind singer. There was no joy or comfort around him, and he never thought of so-called happiness in life. He was like a lonely statue in a dilapidated temple, spending desolate and tragic years; every day, he had to sing for a living.</p>
<p>Every time, when he passed the Mei Hua Bridge and the thin bamboo cane knocked into the Bai Sui Alley, making some strange echoes, he would lengthen that slightly melancholic and trembling tune and sing:</p>
<p>Life is a dream, a gray and short dream;</p>
<p>In this dreamland, I have not seen a ray of light.</p>
<p>I do not believe that there is any happiness and joy in the world,</p>
<p>I only know to strive for a little superficial rights and fame!</p>
<p>Because I no longer want to see the world's filth and humanity's ugliness,</p>
<p>So I am willing to be a blind singer;</p>
<p>I want to shout open the secrets of the universe, I want to shout out the dumb riddle of life,</p>
<p>But oh, spring goes and autumn comes year after year,</p>
<p>The long sky is vast, the earth is vast,</p>
<p>Forever, forever, the universe is still silent...</p>
<p>Singing, singing, he did not hope that more people could understand what this song was saying, but he just wanted to pour out some sorrow into this vast and boundless universe.</p>
<h3 id="e203">High-rise Building <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>"Street scenes" are not as simple as the coming and going of vehicles and horses.</p>
<p>Since I moved into the high-rise building, it was certainly an accidental thing. Looking down from the window, there is a busy street in front, and all kinds of things are taken into view. This is not enjoyment. People who live in high-rise buildings are not necessarily the masters of material things. Seeing the pedestrians outside stride forward, I feel that my soul is like a caged bird, even if there is good food in the cage, and the cage bars are dazzling gold. I no longer hope to live in a high-rise building. Isn't a prison also a tall building? Although it is high, it cannot climb to heaven. Wouldn't living in a low house go to hell?</p>
<p>When I idly look at the street, it is considered a leisure pastime, stealing a bit of strength from the heavy burden. Every time I think silently, the backs of the pedestrians passing by, regardless of age, a child, a bearded man, all feel the same sadness to me. It's not theirs, it should be my own sorrow.</p>
<p>In the morning, the street is very quiet. Those who get up early include workers, students, and vendors - some people with the same fate, strangely energetic. Whether it is spring or winter, the spirit of heroism is not necessarily their own. Perhaps it is because the whip of life is drawn on their backs, like horses and donkeys blindly walking a road that cannot be finished, forward! Forward! Who can say for sure that it is a "broad road"? The attitude of the students carrying their schoolbags is sincere. The rickshaw pullers carry the handles of their cars, dragging empty cars, without customers wandering, which is a leisure annoyance. The newspaper sellers shout hoarsely like injured people howling. All of this is deeply imprinted in my eyes, a picture of labor, hard work, and the selling of sweat and blood.</p>
<p>Every busy street has a social history. From morning to night, from spring to winter, it shows the progress of the "fashion" of the young ladies and the popular "handsome" of the young masters. Both women and men, the pretty and the stupid, the heartbroken and the frustrated, and the stories from "birth" to "funeral" are all revealed here. Standing at the window, I not only read a history book, but there are also a lot of lessons in the history book.</p>

<p>Bright Moon Ascends to the East</p>
<p>Quiet, at night, the stars and moon are unusually bright. A corner of a pier in a port town, iron chains and wooden stakes lying there, and large wooden barrels along the edge squatting there like tired cows. Two policemen and a patrol leader walk over.</p>
<p>They are pasting notices along the way, offering a reward of one hundred pounds for the arrest of an escaped convict. This is a key point for escape, and therefore a good place to post notices.</p>
<p>The police opened the paper bag, took out the notice, and asked their patrol leader for instructions; the patrol leader hesitated slightly for a moment: "Okay, post one!" On that wooden barrel that looked like a tired ox squatting there, a "…hair black, eyes black. Height five feet five inches…" bounty notice was posted.</p>
<p>The three people had joy in their hearts, no, maybe they had pain. Although they understood that the escaped convict was a genius, sometimes they hated why they didn't have the opportunity to see him - that escaped convict! But their duty held him tightly.</p>
<p>So, one of the three went to other places to post their notices.</p>
<p>Quiet, with only the patrol leader remaining, he paced back and forth, the light of the stars and moon brought his gaze to the notice that was not yet pasted tightly: "One hundred pounds, and a promotion…" the temptation fluttered before his eyes. He consciously thought of "Many honest people have not seen such a large sum of money!"…</p>
<p>A dark shadow moved from the left, and he knew to shout at him to stop. It was a ragged beggar, a vagrant. While telling the patrol leader that he was a poor song seller, he kept walking forward.</p>
<p>Isn't that right? The poor can be bullied by anyone. He was stopped by the patrol leader's order.</p>
<p>However, he was very witty, he played dumb, he did not get the patrol leader's permission. He sang…</p>
<p>"Life flows like a muddy river,</p>
<p>Machines eat our flesh!</p>
<p>Coal smoke blackens our faces,</p>
<p>Liquor scorches our hearts.</p>
<p>…" Song.</p>
<p>Naturally, that one didn't want to listen anymore and told him to shut up.</p>
<p>He - the vagrant temporarily stopped singing, but became a preacher, and talked and talked to that one. When the patrol leader felt that he himself was also a weak person, being ordered to do dangerous errands, even disregarding having a "family", he couldn't help but feel a resonance of sympathy in his heart for this vagrant in front of him. He continued to sing,…</p>
<p>But this song is a code.</p>
<p>When the two policemen who posted the notices returned, the patrol leader let the vagrant hide without hesitation. He told the two policemen to go first.…</p>
<p>"Goodbye! Friend, thank you. You have been kind to me tonight, I am grateful to you. When we raise the weak and overthrow the strong in the future, I may repay you in the same way… Our positions will all change in the future, until the bright moon rises in the east…" The vagrant walked out of the wooden barrel, waved his hand to the patrol leader, walked down the stairs, and followed the code. - escaped from the one hundred pound reward.</p>
<p>The patrol leader loudly read the "one hundred pounds, one hundred pounds" confession, like being struck by thunder, doubting "Am I really as stupid as I thought I was?"</p>
<p>Guess! That is the escaped convict wanted with a one hundred pound reward!</p>

At the foot of the Great Barren Mountain, it emitted light.  Vast and boundless, the Immortal pointed the way. A Mysterious Real Person carried it back. The stubborn stone became spiritually enlightened and entered a mother's womb. It was born into the Jia family's noble lineage. The bestowed childhood name Baoyu was not without meaning. Because, at birth, he came out of the womb holding jade. Lady Dowager Jia cherished him like a treasure. Often worrying about heavy rain and strong winds. His comings and goings were taught by female servants. Then came the exceptionally beautiful Lin Daiyu. She was the first among the Twelve Beauties. They were childhood sweethearts with mutual affection. They spent their days together intimately. Picking flowers and touching grass for joy. Playing with powder and rouge by her eyebrows. Accompanying her in meditation in the embroidered pavilion. What a romantic and suave young master Jia. Speaking of studying, he would frown. Alas, strict family rules forced him to pursue his studies. Xiren and Sheyue often persuaded him, saying, "Stepping on the golden鳌 will bring thunder in spring on flat ground." To obtain the glory of bringing honor to ancestors and revitalizing the family. But he disdained many scholars, saying. Falling leaves and seeds are not for me. Ever since I dreamt of entering the Red Chamber. I have let the ambitions of wealth and fame turn to ashes. Only Miss Lin knows my heart. I willingly die and become flying ashes. Better than monopolizing the鳌's head and enjoying the spring breeze. After enjoying a few years of a young master's fortune. He repaid the effort and reluctantly went to the autumn exam.

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The screening of "The Story of Louis Pasteur", starring Paul Muni, took place at 11 a.m. yesterday at the Grand Theater (another screening will be held at the Cathay Theater on the 29th at 11 a.m.). "It seems pretty good."</p>
<p>Confucius said: Mr. Shao Zuiweng should see it once, because this is an educational film.</p>
<p>Someone once said that I would be going to "Northern Shanxi" "soon". Not long after, another newspaper specializing in wholesale and retail "Red Stickers" said that "because the Communist bandits suffered a crushing defeat, he decided to stay in Shanghai temporarily".</p>
<p>This trap is really very clever. Knowing that I am "staying in Shanghai", they arranged this set-up. Isn't it "proof" enough in every way?</p>
<p>However, I am silent. Because people have gone to so much trouble to put on this "act", if I were to make a statement again, that would be too "shameless".</p>
<p>A friend once advised me that someone was going to pay a few gangsters ten dollars to "teach" me a lesson. Later, I met Brother Ye Cha, who declared that there was absolutely no such thing. If there is absolutely no such thing, I will avoid a "lesson", which is naturally even better.</p>
<p>Recently, I read Mr. Wu Cun's "self-criticism" and saw the words "old man" in it again, so I couldn't help but think of my friend's words again.</p>
<p>"Teach" me a lesson, okay, let me be "taught" a lesson. As for "jottings", I will still continue to write. Although this seems to make the term "old man" even more applicable.</p>

<p>Some people advise the editor, and some people offer suggestions to the editor. In short: they all don't want the jottings to be so "miscellaneous" anymore (the charge is probably that it's too damaging to the dignity of prominent figures, right?)</p>
<p>Advice and suggestions were not enough, so they went a step further and came up with a clever plan while drinking tea at Xinya: calling the advertising department in the name of the ×× Film Company.</p>
<p>Who is the designer, who is the "practitioner", everyone knows in their hearts. "To avoid expanding the dispute and the trouble of correction, I will not discuss it." In short, although this clever plan took a lot of effort, it was not necessarily "brilliant." First, Tianyi Company had used such a clever plan before, this is an old trick. Second, this is still done under a false name, which is inevitably a bit evasive. Third... going on would give the impression of "practicing the art of climbing the dragon". Better not to say it.</p>
<p>Confucius said: "Brilliant"? "Brilliant"?</p>
<p>Confucius said: Mr. Anonymous, after seeing yesterday's Silver Jottings, reportedly went to Mr. Lin at the Datong Apartment on Beile Road without eating breakfast, asking Mr. Lin why he had taken down such a rotten, dirty thing. Mr. Anonymous should know better than anyone who took it down. Thanks to Brother Cunren's introduction, we seemed to nod to each other when we met, even if we weren't quite "friends" yet, it didn't seem necessary to use such not-so-"brilliant" means. If you have any new "gimmicks", please give me a call, and I will definitely go to Xinya to listen to your advice.</p>

<p>People in the inland areas still hold illusions, thinking that Shanghai is paved with gold and everyone rushes to Shanghai to make a living. Little do they know that the Shanghai market is deteriorating every day, and it is more difficult than ascending to heaven to find even a half-time job, resulting in wandering around the city, suffering unspeakable hardships. The "National Beauty" sound film by Shanghai Company, starring Yuan Erchun and Bai Hong, exposes the various economic downturns and difficulties of life in Shanghai to the fullest extent, enough to shatter the dreams of people in the inland areas. The film is released today at the Carlton Theater.</p>
