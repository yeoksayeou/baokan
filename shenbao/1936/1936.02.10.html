<p>華聊社特稿　在倫敦軍縮會議中、日本要求英美予以軍備平等、但英美止認其兩國間之軍備平等、而對於日本則出以保持軍備優勢之態度、於是英美對日發生正面衝突、日本乃至脫退軍縮會議、日本退出軍縮會議後、關於日英美對華問題、殊有重大之影響、此吾人所應注意老也、從來日本對華問題、首在避免英美之共同抗議、對於華北問題更然、故此决日本極力使華北問題與軍縮會議老劃分為二、蓋亦因懼英美藉軍縮會議之共同制日立塲、轉而為共同干涉日本之對華政策、亦未可知、故日本急於脫退軍縮、</p>
<p>最近甚有人相信、對華問題日英可以提携、但就事實以言、日英對華同盟、殊難實現蓋英欲在華發展、雖以與日勾結為有利、與美聯合無必要、但英若因對華問題勾結日本、日本亦勢必藉此向英要求在南洋菲洲南美等英殖民地之開放、而該各處英日之利益對立甚深、如是英之所得、殊難償其所失、故在對華問題上央與日結訂協定、可云毫無可能、但英國自身欲與日本孤軍奪取中國市塲、又為力所不許、因而一般人俱深信英美將必合力應付日本、求得以共同之力瓜分中國、然則定有人以為英國對於日本之侵略中國、猶如意大利之奪取阿比西尼亞、將亦必抱同樣之讓步態度、如前英國外相之提議分讓阿比西尼亞案、必亦將提議分讓中國、但其實不然、因美國若由中國退卻、則立卽影響於印度之安全、至今英已失去　羅之市塲、為日本所取而代之矣、故英國若由中國退却、結果卽不啻由東亞退卻、譲日本奪去、</p>
<p>準上以言、英美對華問題實有聯合共同制日之共同要求、然其所以不能實現者、卽緣於英美在華之白銀問題相衝突之故、於是反予日本以有利之機會、前决美國採取購　白銀政策、對於中國經濟打擊極大、而立於中國背後之英國、亦因之受美國白銀政策之打擊、此决中國改革幣制、廢除銀本位、據傳中國貨幣已加入英鎊集團、而根本上推翻美國之白銀政策、亦卽為英對美報復之表現、查銀價由以前之三更士、一跌為二便士、卽的跌三成、美國於是不得不　認英在華之優勢、今後或上能仍採取對華門戶開放主義、以維持其固有之遠束政策、而向英妥恊之色彩、於是轉而漸濃、况英國為維護其在華之既得權益計、今後捨與美提携、亦不能單獨制日、故將來英美對華北問題殊有共同對日之可能性、尙有因對華為中心問題之另一要素、卽為準備競爭、今後日英美間、允以日美間之擴軍競爭、乃為必至之事實、</p>
<p>至於擴軍競爭之情形、則英主小艦多數主義、美三一三萬五千噸以上之日艦主義、日本亦計劃建戰鬥艦五萬噸、以示對抗、查日本本年預算為一十二億七億元之巨數、卽單就其軍事費之增加言、近兩三年間勢亦必達二十五億元左右、其影響於財政支出之膨脹者甚大、結果自不免更增加赤字公債耳、結果日本為對華政策與英美對抗、不得擴張海陸軍備、軍需工業雖有崎形之發展、但「兵農兩全」之幻想、必不能達到、勢非犧牲一般產業之平均發展不可、而日本經濟危機今務勢將更加深也、</p>

<p>— 俞慶棠主編　企之</p>
<p>久違了的故鄉宜興</p>
<p>一個農村貧乏的分析</p>
<p>一，</p>
<p>多謝我這塲病—它使我有機會，回到鄉間（幷且是故鄉）小住。爲了讀書（我到現在還不了解我在中學大學所讀的那些書對我有什麼用處，除掉混到一個資格之外。所以只是『爲讀書而讀書』了。），爲了吃飯，不得不在各都市中漂流着。因爲看慣了整齊的馬路，高大的建築，美麗的橱窗，華貴的紳士，以及器宇軒昂的洋大人，回去看到生長於斯的故鄉的一切，似乎和童年的回憶中的景象大有不同，引起了我新奇的注意。</p>
<p>二，</p>
<p>也不完全因爲我的「眼界高」了，故鄉的一切，在這六七年中，却有許多地方是變了，第一從前回去一定要趁火車到無錫，再趁小輸船到宜興，然後再換趁民船，一共要化兩天的時間。現在只要化大半天就行。無論從南京，上海或杭州回去，都可以自京杭公路，錫宜公路及宜常（常州）公路趁長途汽車回家。這對於放假回去的學生，趕路的商人以及假期返里的職員，有說不出的方便。不過到底還沒有能代替了輪船和民船。趁長途汽車每一里差不多要化一分大洋一分大洋就等於三個銅板，三個銅板就等於一塊大餅，趁十多里汽車所費就可以維持鄉下一天的生活。三四十里（或者再多一點）路程在鄕下人只要動動脚就到。如果再遠些，化幾百文便可以趁船去，在這上面還好喝茶，攀談，，假睡。許多農產品如稻，紅薯，蔬菜，山貨，陶器等，以及從都市中來的油鹽布疋等等，還依靠船運。南方有的是河道，而「五湖四海」都是「任舟行」的不要化錢。幷且船運所費也省得多。所以輪船，班船仍舊有，不過設備得更適合鄉下人的需要一些。至於鄉下人出了田地，出了人工築成的公路的代價，只是添了些「眼福」：地老虎似的汽車，嗚嗚亂呌，牽着洋狗的洋婆，帶着她的丈夫來來去去，春秋佳日，成羣的小汽車（鄉人呼自備車爲小汽車以別於長途汽車）載滿端莊華麗的先生和婷婷娉娉的太太或小姐；不時的，還有整隊的軍旅，全副武裝的走過或老在卡車上馳過。</p>
<p>看慣了南京那高大雄偉的古城牆，宜興城垣好像一道北方村落所有的「圍子」。在這城圈裏以前初由鄉間進城時覺得非繁盛的大街—寬大平正的石皮路齊整劃一的金字招牌；紅漆櫃台；，貨橱裏五光十色的商品—現在却顯得十分冷落。金—紅輝煌的顏色已退了光，是經過長期風雨的剝蝕沒有能加以粉漆：店堂裹幾個人影在昏黑的幽暗中交易着。大街中熙熙攘攘摩踪接背的鄉下人也不見了許多。一切都顯現得零訊，幽暗淸閒，甚至有些悽凉了·走盡了幾條街，只發現幾個例外：幾家洋貨店（有如上海的小百貨公司）則頗發達，完全以最新式的門面橱窗裝飾着：法國的西蒙蜜，可的香粉，英國的冷毛織物等等都用最足以引人的圖色和光綫陳列着。此外，有三四家銀行的分行也出現了。這是新來的但是很有勢力的「商店」，所以它的房屋也是黑白鮮明，雄糾糾地聳立着。如上海銀行，江蘇省農民銀行等以農產品的抵押爲主要營業，它們在四鄉交通便利的地方還設了好多處倉庫，盛受鄉下人的抵押品。還有些職業是從前沒有的，如報館，律師各有好幾家，起初以爲這是家鄉文化程度和法律知識的提高，但到我出來時已不得不完全加以吾定了。</p>
<p>三，</p>
<p>一回到故居的P村，那依舊的影物允其是那種生活方式，立刻提起了我童年代的經騐，使我感覺到十二分熟悉：隨時序的進展而做各種耕作，揷秧，收穫，種麥，樵柴，一點也沒有更變；甚至那一塊秧田，桑園，菜地，甚至一個灰堆都是照舊。人口是增加不少，允其是小孩子，一羣軍十幾個從三四歲到十來歲的孩童在向陽的塲角裏嬉戲着。戶口也增加了。有些一向在外跑碼頭和做廠的，也因爲工商業的倒閉而趕回農村了。</p>
<p>貧窮的顏色灑遍這有三四百戶，從前是豐足有名的大村落。雖然附近就是石灰的產地，牆壁被剝蝕一塊黃一塊黑。多年未粉刷了，茅草修補了瓦屋上的漏洞，菜園也不再用度或竹枝編籬，而是用向日葵桿，桑枝以及一切不耍化錢買的東西。每一個人都是蓬着頭或留着長髮，因爲這樣可省着剪頭錢。衣服是無所謂單的夾的，能抓到就穿上。所謂整齊淸潔在他們是從未想到的。前年大旱之後，去年（一九三五）春夏二季，全村吃米飯的只有十餘家。其餘却吃雜糧或者餓肚子。這是從來未曾有的事情。村上的小學是不收費的，但是學生一天天的减少，因爲支出一二元錢的書籍費對他們是極大的奢侈（甚至是有點浪費），何况上十歲的孩于也可以在田裏帮父親收收草，送送飯了呢。</p>
<p>村邊宅旁，本來有不少樹木和竹林，現在都不見了。離村不遠的南山，記得小時候常在春天到山界的密林深處找掘蘭花，有風的時侯，可以聽到滿谷的松濤，嚇得小的伙伴以爲是虎嘯而驚號起來。現在都變成了濯濯的童山！山上的樹木都伐光了。不用說，鄉下人窮到迫不及待把一切可以變成現錢的東西都變成錢了。</p>
<p>鄉下人因爲期，信用完全破產。鄉問店家絕對不再放賬，通融借貸需要十二分面情或者二分以上的利息。的確，錢是鄉間最缺乏的東西。窮，窮，就是它的全貌。想不到我的故里—而山背水，「阡陌縱橫」，「屋舍儼然」，「怡然自樂」的P村，在這幾年中，已破落得如此了。</p>

<p>— 衛生署技正　金寶善</p>
<p>各位聽衆，今天所要講的，還是繼續上次未講完的「疾病的發生和預防」，這個題目，記得上次我們將疾病的發生已講完了，現在我們便耍說到在病未發生前應如何預防以及預防的方法了。</p>
<p>上决已經說過，現在因為社會的演進，人類健康被刦奪的機會愈多，所以我們為要保持我們的生命，維護我們的健康，我們就該竭力設法去適應這種新環境，醫學的設施，就是替人類謀適應指新環境的一個方法。醫學從極幼稚而暗昧的程度，漸漸進展到今日的科學醫學，對於除病的效力，亦由此逐漸的增加，從前患了梅毒的病人，祇有聽他自然的十年八年的爛去，現在已有特效藥可以注射了，只要治得早，便可把病根除去，從前有許多沒有藥治的疾病，得了病，就得備着棺材等死，現在則有藥可以醫治了，這就是現代科學醫學給與社會人類的福利。但是我們對於這種除病法，還是不能滿意，因為有病求醫，是第二步不得已的辦法，我們姑且不論藥石之煩，刀圭之苦，和有病期閒的經濟損失，就使有法可治的疾患，還是免不了有相當的危險，因為有許多疾病，雖有醫生治療，還須賴牠自然良好的經過，如果經過不良，醫生　竭盡智力，也是難以救濟，所以與其臨渴掘井，莫如未爾綢繆，注意於事先的預防，事實上多數的疾病，都有方法可以預防的，「一兩預防勝於一磅治療」的一句西諺，已經成為醫界的金科玉　，這種積極的除病法，就是現代聲學中最佔重要部份的「預防醫學」。預防醫學底目的，是在消除各種致病的內因。藉以提高民衆的健康，防避由外部向身體發生作用或由外部侵入體內而生作用的外因，俾得防止疾病的發生，牠的最終、目的，就是在使全人類都能夠享受最豐富的生活，而予社會以最大的貢獻——獲得眞正的健康。</p>
<p>預防疾病的根本方法，就是個個人都要有健康的生活和合乎衛生的環境：努力促進個人的健康，同時還要接受科學所賜予吾人特殊的防病方法——就是「打預防針」。但是我們要知道人在社會上，並不是孤立的，一個人生了病，就能夠影饗到第二個人，社會上的環境不合衛生，個人的環境也自然要受累的，因此我們還要再進一步的推求，這便是努力協助公共衛生事業的建設了。現在就把這幾方面很簡的陳述在後面。</p>
<p>個人的健康生活個人的健康生活，包括身體的和心理的兩方面，我們要得到這種的健康生活，第一步先要具有維持身體健康的知識—就是普通的醫藥衛生常識，第二步再根據這些知識來養成正確的理想和態度，切實的把我們整憫的生活，變成衛生化。在個人健康生活上最重要的，有下列幾點：第一，要注意營養，因為人體的構造和各種機能助作，都是溯源於食物，所以教們劉於食物的選擇，應該支配當得，使能供給身體上各種的需要，對於食物的質是道樣，對於量的方面也是一樣的要注意，第　點，要注意休息，我們終日的工作，致身體各部疲乏，自然要有適當的休息，才能夠保持身體的健康，睡眠是休息的最好方法，失眠的人，因為身體祗有消耗而無補償，所以日漸消瘦，健康就此墮落，疾病也就容易發生，普通每人每日至少耍睡足八小時。第三，應注意淸潔，因為不淸潔是健康的最大障礙；食物不淸潔，不但阻礙消化，還有釀成腸胃病的可能性；牙齒不淸潔，易患蛀牙，還能引起其他的重病如腎炎等；皮膚不清潔，就直接會誘生各種的皮膚病，間接影鄉到體內的新陳代謝作用——就是生理作用。第四，應注意正常的排洩，人體因各種生理作用所產生的廢物，以及食物經消化後所剩餘的殘屑，必須排出體外，才能夠保持身體的健康。這些廢物的排泄，取道於肺，皮膚，大腸，和腎臟等處，我們　要促進肺部的排泄，應使室內空氣時常的流通，還要常到戶外去享受新鮮空氣的利益；對於皮膚，就要時常沐浴，注意淸潔；欲促進大腸的排泄，應於每日按時去大便，使能成為習慣，多吃水菓靑菜，也是很有益處的；至於促進腎職的排泄，最要緊的就是要多喝開水，每日至少六大杯，其决就是要運動，因為適宜而適度的運動，能夠促進血液的循環，使內分泌的水份和熱力，能夠均勻的分佈全身，同時遺能增加身體的排洩作用，促進全身的營養。第六，應注意養成美滿的精神生活，就是耍訓練個人，使其對於各種的環境情形以及生活上的各種問題，都能應付裕如，要想達到這種目標，就要培養個人的自恃力，自尊心，和不自私而有寬敞的心地，在業餘還要注意從事於正當的娛樂。我們前天所說的「糖尿病」，是一種「新陳代謝」機能失常的病，主要的緣故，是因為胰腺所生的「胰島紫」不足用，有了這種糖尿病的人，如果能夠愼飲食，少吃澱粉質和糖類的食物，同時把整個生活保持正常狀態，不興健康原則背馳，最低限度也可以滅輕病勢。至於對於外來致病的原因，如同我前天所舉的「肺　病」一例，我們知道，講究衛生體質　健的人，病菌是難以發作的，況且癆菌是由於患癆病者的痰唾或患處的排洩物而來的，假使我們不隨地唾痰，還能於談笑咳嗽打噴嚏的時候，都用手巾掩蓋口鼻，分開病人的用具，再將病人的痰唾和患處的排洩物，放在一定的地方，而隨時加以消毒的處置，這樣，簡直就是把癆菌的進出口完全斷絕，，傳染的途徑既斷絕了，病自然就不會傳染，如果我們能冉進一步把所有患此病而帶有傳染性的人，都送到醫院裹或療養院裹去隔離起來，那就更加安全了。</p>
<p>預防注射預防注射，普通叫作打預防針，這是科學賜給我們的一種特殊的防病方法很是可靠。我們前天已經說過，人體內有一種免疫力，能夠抗禦傳染病，這個免疫力有天然的，也有後天的，現代的醫學，已經能夠應用人工方法，使人體組織發生後天性的免疫力，以抵抗某種的傳染病，這種人工的方法，就是用少量的已死病菌或病毒注入人體，足以刺戟人體組織，以生免疫質而不足致人於病，現在已經確實證明有價值的預防注射，有種牛痘以防天花，注射白喉類毒素以防白喉，注射傷寒霍亂疫苗以防傷寒和霍亂，注射陪斯忒疫苗以增加對鼠疫的抵抗力等等。我們在這危險百出的環境中過活的人們，對於這個科學方法，應當盡量去接受，不可稍事忽略。</p>
<p>環境的衛生注意環境衛生，是杜絕病菌傳達途徑的最好方法，有許多疾病的傳染，都是由於環境不合衛生所致的。譬如腸　傳染病——如傷寒，霍亂，痢疾，都是山帶有這些病菌的糞便沾染了水源，或由蒼蠅或其他病菌者的媒介，把糞便中的病菌傳達到食物上面，而致傳染蔓延的。所以我們如果能注意改良供水的裝置，保護水源的淸潔，廚房飯廳的設置紗窗紗門，則所亦裝置防蠅設備，棄置糞便先加消毒，或裝設下水道，然後將所有的糞便導入一個公共的養　塲所，而加以消毒處置，這樣就不但蒼蠅無從孽生，而水源食物亦不數為病菌所染，病就不會傳染了。至於個人居住的房屋，房屋周圍的環境，和一切公共娛樂塲所等等，都能嚴格符合衛生法則，對於健康上和防病上都有莫大裨益，允其是對於呼吸系傳染病，如傷風，感冒，肺炎等等，更屬有效，他如流通積水池，水溝，剷除雜草，俾使蚊蟲無從孽生，就可預防瘧疾，回歸熱，象皮病等等，因為這些病都是由於蚊蟲的媒介而傳染的，所以環境衛生在防病上實佔有重要之地位。</p>
<p>總括以上防止疾病發生的各種設施方法，不外先使一般民衆能明瞭疾病發生的原因，而由個人健康生活做起，再進而接授各種預防注射改善環境衛生等等，都是很重耍的。不過個人的能力有限，我們需要整個社會合作的能力，使收衆擎易舉之效。因此到了一八四八年以後，凡是進化的國家，求人類幸福的社會，都有一種叫作公共衛生的組織，所以我現在就把這種公共衛生的組織，略為介紹來作個結束：公共衛生是一種社會的組織，用以預防疾病，延長壽命，促進人類的健康，由這種的組織去講求環境的衛生，制止傳染病，灌輸個人衛生的知識，組織公共的醫事衛生機關，以期達到早期診斷及防止各種的疾病，並使個人可得有適宜的生活狀況，以維持健康，簡單的說來，公共衛生就是為人類防疾病謀幸福的一種社會組織，牠的範圍很廣，包括醫藥的管理醫療的救濟各種傳染病的抑制和預防，工業衛生，學校衛生，婦嬰衛生，環境衛生，衛生化騐，生命統計，衛生教育的實施，公共衛生事業上的研究，衛生工作人員的訓練等等，由上述種種的設施，直接就可以減少人口的死亡率和社會上的疾病率，閒接可以增進社會的生產力，充裕社會的經濟。我現在祇要舉出幾個較明顯的例子，便可証實公共衛生的確可以替社會人類謀幸福。</p>
<p>人壽的增進——在十六世紀的時候，歐洲各國的平均人壽，只有二十一歲左右，但是現在有幾國——如澳大利和新西蘭——平均人壽已增加到六十歲，其中一大部份都是在最近五十年中跟着科學醫學的進展而增加的。我國科事醫學還未有相當的發展，平均人壽大的還在三十歲左右，這就可以明白醫學的發展與人壽的關係了。</p>
<p>巴拿為運河的成功——這就是以人力戰勝　疾的一例，當法國人起始開掘巴拿馬運河的時候，因為瘧疾盛行，每十萬工人中，罹病而死的有一千五百人之多，因為人命和經濟兩方面的損失太大，只得停工，後來發明了瘧疾的傳染法，美國就實施預防瘧疾的各種方法，繼續開掘巴拿馬運河，結果道偉大的工程竟告成功。</p>
<p>傷寒——在三十年前的歐美各國，每十萬人中，每年得此病而死的，總有三十幾個，但是自經發現了此病傳染的媒介物為水與蒼蠅以後，他們就極力改善環境衛生，最注意於糞便的處置，供水設置的改良和滅蠅等項，到了現在，得此病而死的，在美國每十萬人中祗有三人，英國就只有一人，但是這病在中國，現在還是很盛行，每年每十萬人中，因此病而死的總不下三十人，這不是公共衛生能減少疾病很顯著的一個例麼？</p>
<p>鼠疫——鼠疫會盛行於福建廣東及歐洲各國，在十四世紀的時候，歐洲全人口的四分之一（約二百五十萬）都患此病面死，自經採用各種預防方法後，目下歐洲各國幾乎沒有鼠疫存在了。但是我國的福建新疆，今年還有一决的大流行，這又可証明預防醫學的價值。</p>
<p>上述四例很明顯的告訴我們：要為社會人類除疾病謀幸福，就該竭力從事於各種公共衛生的設施，現在我國政府對於衛生事業的推進，已具决心正在陸續發展之中，不過還要希望全國上下一心，共同努力去研究提倡，俾能普遍的推及全國各地，這樣一來，不但疾病可以剷除，民族的地位也可蒸蒸日上而與世界列強並駕齊驅。（完）</p>

<p>經濟專刊美元下跌之剖視  蔣裕聲　　　穩定已達六個月以上之英美滙率，一個月來突轉浮動，美元趨軟，計自一月一日每英鎊合四。九三美元，至二月四日合五。〇二六二五美元，三日以前尚徘徊於五。〇一以內，至四日驟然升高，致影響吾國中央銀行自改制以來久已穩定之對美滙率，因防止投機者乘機在上海拋售美元，而將滙率由國幣每百元合二九。七五美元，升至每百元合三〇·二五美元。其他對英日法各國之滙率則仍維原狀。　　北次美元下跌，實為美國默許之事實，其結果不惟有利於美國之對外貿易，且可暫弛美國金準備之過剩問題，並因此而維持法郎之地位。緣跌價以後，美國即為黃金之外流，二月四日，美財部已准許價值八，五〇〇，〇〇〇美元之黃金運往法國，一，一二〇，〇〇〇美元之黃金運往荷蘭，爲數月來第一次之倒流，使金集團國家减少存金枯竭之恐慌。而美法滙率亦同時提高，最近一週間，自一月三十日每法郞合美金六。六七分，升至二月四日之六。六九五分。然則此後美元是吾將繼續下跌，循至形成通貨膨脹，抑將轉趨堅挺，吾人應先行考查此决跌價之原因。　　（二）　　此决美元下跌之主要原因，一爲由下列數端所造成之膨脹空氣：　　　國會吾定羅斯福總統對於恩給金案之吾决，使政府即須支付的美金二十二萬萬兀之巨欵。　　　最高法院判决農業調整法爲違憲，故手續稅之徵收發生問題，而政府對農民尚有五萬萬美元以上之津貼仍須付給。　　　預算不能平衡。　　美政府必須籌割巨欵，應付上述三端，乃當然之事。而目下選舉之期已近，爲政治生命之立塲計，此時當局徵收新稅，頗不相宜，所剩其他之計劃，直接間接皆有膨脹之可能。　　其决爲美元跌價之原因者，爲歐洲黃金之大量流入。過去一年，美國準備差額增加一，四六八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元，超過法定準備率二，七〇〇，〇〇〇〇〇〇〇美兀，發生嚴重之過剩準備問題，並使金三銀一之準備比例永難達到，而一方面歐洲用　　　則存金有枯竭之虞，法郞危機不絕如縷，如一旦法荷被迫放棄金本位，則英美供蒙不利。美國兼顧國內外之悄勢，自願美兀下跌，此外尚有中國最近售於美國之巨量白銀，據美國商業金融週報之記載，中國無意購進美兀而傾向於英鎊之獲取，此於美兀下跌亦不無關係。　　（三）　　吾人於審察美元下跌之原因以後，深信此種凶素一時未必能解决，而美儿低價之現狀亦尚有相當時間之延續。然認美國目前之膨脹空氣即足以使美元貶值，則未免過當，美國此時儘可以發行新公債以應付巨欵之支出。以美國之人口與財富爲比例，其現有之國債額尚遠遜於歐洲谷國，新公債之發行不能即謂爲膨脹。此外羅斯福各項統制計劃之取消，正爲私人企蒙抬頭之機會，表面上且可以省去此後巨額經費之支出。故膨脹　空氣促成一時美兀之低落則有之，因而至於貶值則不然。美元貶值，並非必不可能，第其時期未至耳。此時美國正以黃金倒流援助法郞之地位。惟金本位之最後命運殊難逆料；世界通貨一旦重陷於新的鬥爭之時，美國始應刖此最後之通貨貶值之手段也。據英國經濟週報之覜察，世界通貨重定運動當在今年底與明年首之間也。恐慌過程下之儲蓄事業  魏友棐　　　一　恐慌過程下之儲蓄事業　　依據中國銀行經濟研究室去年六月底爲止的統計，全國銀行總數一百五十九家，上海却佔據了百分之三十八，計六十家。如果加入了漢口，北平，天津，南京，杭州，重慶，廣州，靑島八市區合併計算，那末總計有九十八家，佔據總數百分之六十二。其决，是江浙兩省，一共有三十家，佔總數百分之十九弱。至於其他二十一省跟國外的銀行呢，也不過三十家，佔總數的百分十九强。這足見我國銀行事業在都市琦形發展的一般形態了。　　銀行在都市的發展，是不是山於需要方面的激增呢？據實際考查下來，道猜想是錯誤的。因爲照上面所分地區的人口而論，那末，上海等九市不過佔百分之二，江浙兩省佔百分之十五，共他各地佔百分之八十三，跟銀行的多少是正在相反的比例之下的。　　銀行的發展狀况，可以說是偏於交通較便利的幾個省份，易言之，即是偏於與各資本主義國家有較多通商關係的區域，亦即是　集於許多所謂「條的口岸」。就是從各銀行的性質而論，也可以知道商業銀行是佔着最多數，而佔總人口大多數的工農銀行，反在决要地位，這足以看出我國銀行事業跟實際的經濟生活是發生怎樣的一個關係了。　　向來我國的金融形　，是都市榨取農村，而在各資本主義國家勢力統治下的條的口岸，又榨取於內地的小都市。榨取的過程，是發生於大部市將商品輸到內地，而內地將土貨輪到大都市的逆態人超上。在夏季絲茶上市，秋季秋收時間，向例都市的資余流到內地去等到內地收買都市商品時候，資金就流到上海來，如此一來一往，金融機關就利用這一些資金的融通而榨取一些利潤，所以假定這一種季節的金融流通能够順利，那末，這許多　集於都市的許多商業銀行就可以得到利潤，而共立足地於根本不能脫離都市，允其是所謂條的口岸」，這是各市區銀行事業特別發呈的一個主要原囚。　　但不幸，由於各資本主義國家的過分榨取，這在惡勢力下存活的次殖民地經濟，就發生了裂痕，面寄生於這種畸形發展而獲得利潤的都市金融機關，也就感到阻滯。農村經濟的極度衰落，工商業的破產，打破了歷來故常的所謂金融季節，在都市的許多銀行，感到此路不通，於是大多數都改換了營業目標，其改換的方向，就是一般人所知道的經營投機事業。其中最爲一般人所樂趨的，大概有三條路，其一是買地產，其二是買公債，其三是買外匯。　　在那時，農村巳在恐慌的掙扎中，而都市的表面形態還存在，尚未有顯著的變化。地產在當時，一方擁有都市上許多人口的需要，一方又有許多洋商的屯買，他的利潤在一般的商業放欵以上，而穩固似又過之。至於證劵跟外匯的套買，也是厚利所在，於是這　者，就成爲銀行的主要業務之一，所謂放欵一項，簡直可以說有「存闕」之疑了。所以無論工商業如何慘沮，金融業的獲利，依然是首首屈一指。　　一二八的砲聲下，恐慌隨之而深刻化，素來流通於金融社會之間的道契，頓時成了廢紙，擁有多量地產的銀行，在從前地產值錢的時候，尚可以左之右之，而現在則頓成了周轉不靈的狀態下。不久，美國施行購銀政策，想把中國從恐慌中跳出來去承受其剩餘商品，結果是相反的使中國通貨格外緊縮，而顯示恐慌的演進。銀行在雙方夾攻之下，於是乃有去年六月間的全國金融機關的總崩潰。　　所謂儲蓄蓄事業，也是在銀行事業發皇中聯帶崛起的一種事業。銀行爲要加厚其力量起見，不得不吸收存欵，而儲蓄事業呢，就是用高利吸收存欵，及化零爲整的力法，來增殖利潤的一種業務。從過去的事實上看，頗有許多利用高利以及「大贈品」的方法來吸收存欵的，但道一些銀行，所運用的方法旣然不合理，多數是在恐慌過程中犧牲了，而其影響所及，則是妨害正見的儲蓄業務的進展。　　　　事　是收集社會游資，培養國民富力，發展生產事業的種事業，所以儲蓄事業的發展狀况，就可以分析出來社會經濟的大概悄形。我們對於正規的儲蓄事　發達的意義，是不應該忽視的。　　我國最初有儲蓄機關，當以光緒三十二年（一九〇六）上海的信成銀行爲原始。到現在爲止，全國的儲蓄總機關，包括儲蓄會，信託公司在內，大的有九十幾家，上海方面也佔到四分之三。其總數照二十二年底的統計，只有四萬萬元，每人不足一元，與先進各國相比，眞耍美得很遠，不用說，還是一個雛型。　　辦理儲蓄的銀行，其儲蓄部份的基金，在全機關中的實收資本中，祇佔到一小部份，自二十三年儲蓄銀行法頒布以後，凡是經營儲蓄的銀行，都得另繳儲蓄存欵保證準備於中央銀行，同時嚴格地規定儲蓄存欵的用途與責任，對於儲戶方面，方才有確實的保陣。去年秋間，中國銀行開辦儲蓄部，規定基金五百萬元，交通也增加儲蓄基金爲二百五十萬元，未幾，中央銀行信託局成立，劃撥基金一千萬元，公務員的儲蓄及有彩儲蓄，亦爲其主要業務，可見儲蓄事業已爲一般銀行界之重視了。　　儲蓄存欵在存欵總額中的地位，據民國十年的統計，不足百分之三，二十二年則增加至百分之十七，增加的比例，在五倍以上。其本身的指數增加，則幾至二十三倍，在這十餘年來銀行方面對於儲蓄方面的突進，是足可自慰的。　　從去年金融恐慌風潮勃發之後，儲蓄事業，當然是要受到相當的打擊。現在上海的儲蓄銀行，經去年一度淘汰之後，存者的　十家，這裏所搜集的二十四年末决算公告，只有一小份。對於整個的觀察，爲事實上所難能，也只能得到　個的略情形，測知儲蓄銀行在恐慌過程中是怎樣進展的一個概念而已。　　二　存款的减退狀况　　要明瞭儲蓄銀行槪况的，首先明瞭其存欵的增减情形。照去年六月底的統計，在六個月中，總額略有增加，但就現在所搜集的二十一家的年末統計，則顯有下落的傾向，我們若以過去十二年來增加二十三倍的基念來觀察，則數字的减退，誠足驚人了。（單位千元）　　各行的儲存蓄欵表　　（註）上述二十三年的總數爲排印上便利計，巳經略去。浙實浙興是浙江實業浙江興業的縮寫。　　上面二十一家中，跟去年同期總額相比，的减退百分之四光景。但最重要的中國銀行，尚未得到統計，若根據去年六月底的統計，則是九百幾十萬元。我們計算這二十一家比去年同期所减下的存欵數字，是一千二百萬元，假定內除中國銀行儲蓄存欵一千萬元，則所减少的大的有二百萬元。但是這一個數字是不足爲據的。因爲儲蓄存欵在一年度之後，應該隨時有利息發生，那末二十三年末的二千八百萬的存欵，以通常長年六厘低利計算，也應有一百七十萬的利息，則此一年來所减退的儲蓄額，實還不止此數。而允以去年下半期的减退，較上半期爲甚。　　這一年中存欵的减少，是在我們的意想中的，若以一年中的事實做相當的例證，則可得到下列各項的分析：　　　第一種緣由，是上海人民富力的减退。這一年來，工商業紛紛宣告破產，失業者日有增加，在平時，一般有職業者，多以工作能力，加入儲蓄生利，但在失業之後，無論離　都市，或仍在上海，至多是儲蓄　字的維持原狀。而提出儲蓄以維持生計者，一定不在少數。　　　第一種緣由，可以說由於資本逃避。自秋季金融風潮勃發以來，銀行錢莊相繼破產，一般入對於金融業已不能有向來的信任。同時，因各國貨幣權爭奪關係，我國的匯市已不能安定，忽上忽下，市上發生關於通貨膨脹的流言。這種流言發生之後，允其是施行新幣制之前的十月份中，標金突然漲落不一，投機的風氣日甚。一般擁有儲金者，又深恐儲蓄機關的不可恃，父深恐貨幣的貶值影響於存欵利息的收入，於是不得不將存欵提出來購買外幣，或外國股票，以爲外幣的匯價可以穩定，不致使儲金减值。又一般迷信通　膨脹論者，以爲實行了膨脹之後，物品的市價于定有顯著的向上。其必需的商品，允是利潤豐厚的一種投資。所以關於米穀布匹方面，頓然平添了許多出路。而這一些存欵呢，就變成外幣或物品了。這一種趨勢，就到現在幣制改　　匯市穩定之後？還是沒有消滅。　　　在幣制革新以後，音份人是絕對信仰政府的，市面顯著的感到良好的影響。而又有一般迷信硬幣者，以爲停止了硬幣以後，所流行的都是紙幣，而對於紙幣上叉深刻地印上馬克廬布及漢鈔的印象，以爲非保持硬幣不可。儘有許多人寗願受了損失將存欵變成硬幣，保藏起來，自以爲得到一種安慰。但這一種行動是頗容易認爲對新幣制的一種破壞行爲的，因此那些硬幣保有者，除了用上述方法購置外幣或外國股票以外，就直接地大量購買現金或輔幣，以實現其理想。　　　上海方南儲金的突然　積，是由於內地農村破產，以及政治上，軍事上，社會治安上種種的不安寗。都市的資金　積，在恐慌現象未爆發以前，就增加季節上金融的流通，等到金融的季節發生裂痕之後，又為增加投機事業的原素，在那時，一般資產保有者，還能夠維持相當的利潤，已如上述。但自恐慌爆發以後，許多儲蓄銀行在恐慌下現出了原形，是被犧牲了，犧牲的結果，儲戶方面儘有得不到什麼保障的。儲戶對於儲蓄銀行旣然印下了這深刻的不良好的印象，於是對於正規的許多儲蓄銀行，也發生了疑慮。這一些人旣不能如一般通貨膨脹論者的預測物價及匯價，又不能如硬幣的保有論者的堆積現貨，就將那些由農村搬到都市的資金，依然搬回了農村，或者存入外商銀行，此又爲存欵减少的一個原因。　　三，資金運用概况　　現在我們試觀察這一個年度中的儲蓄銀行對於欵項的運用方面。就向來情形說，除了專設的儲蓄銀行以外，若是商業銀行附設的儲蓄機關，是一種附屬的收欺機關。這一種儲蓄部，除將吸收的存欵直接交與本行運用，即在所謂「本行往來，」「商業往來」「存放同業」的科目掩護下進行著，是無所謂運用的。自從去年儲蓄銀行法裏規定，應該將百分數如何支配以後，那些儲蓄銀行方才有一致的具有規模的收支情形。這裏仍是上面所搜集的二十一家銀行的統計。　　存欵的支配方法，以抵押放欵及有價證券購置所佔的數字爲最大，先看抵押放欵的統計。（單位千元）　　各行的抵押放欵　　就上面二十一家的統計，抵押放欵數字比同期增加二千三百萬，差不多近乎四分之一那一種數字，跟從前相比，於支配方而顯有進步。推測增進的理山，不外乎儲蓄法的制限關係。但就一般人購買金條的理想來測知，則刖金條或其他物品向銀行抵押放欵的，恐怕不在少數，其因恐慌的關係，也有足使存單存摺押欵增加的趨　的，　　同時，根據上海銀行對於抵押放欵性質的報告加以分析，則是房地產押欵佔百分之三五，有價證劵押欵佔百分之三，農產品押欵佔百分之一八，存單及農村貸欵各佔百分之八。　　其次，再　購買有價證券的數字上來看。　　各行的有價證券投資　　公債套利，素是銀錢　資金的唯一出路，自地產沒落以來，公債在營業上所佔的地位更佔重要。我們翻閱了去年下半期的公債成交數，不是超越了歷年的紀錄嗎？這裏所舉的有價證券，可以說全是公債庫券。因爲在現在金融組織下，商業債券同公司股票，可以說一些沒有地位的。銀行家肯投資於有價證券，如果公司債券信用樹立以後，間接即與工商界有利。不幸我國銀行家所關於這一方面獲得的利潤，直接取之於政府，間接即取之於人民，仍不脫於自掘墳墓的範圍裏。要改善這一方面的進展情形，關於健全證券市塲的急於樹立，似乎不應該獨賣金融界的。　　除了公債之外，有價證券中還包含國外的證券投資數目，據四行儲蓄會的報告，關於有價證券一項中，國外證券的佔百分之四五，上海銀行的報告，的佔百分之八，至其他各行的統計，則不詳。　　公債在銀行所佔的地位，這一年度中，可以說無甚增加或减退，因爲在去年度，公債的市價雖有漲上，折扣雖略有减下，但仍不失爲厚利的投資，因此始終把握着重要地位。就數字上論，只增加了千分之七光景。　　就上面所得的印象，可以知道上海的儲蓄事業，也同各種生產事業在同一步驟中顯示衰落。其資金的支配情形，一年來依然不脫畸形狀態進展着，其所支配於生產事業者，仍不過少數罷了。　　總之，大都市榨取於小都市，小都市榨之於農村的金融特質，即以區區儲蓄事業一部而論，已可知現代尚未能脫離道一個畛域。而大量吸收的存欵，還依然靠着利潤的厚薄上想出路。要眞正能够完成統制的銀行制度的作用，一方固應實現到農村去的口號，脫離了「條的口岸」的特殊余融；一方還在於各金融機關的自動將資金運用於生產投資，以奠定其自己的根基的。二五·二·三商業新聞金融　雙毫又加起二釐　　　暗盤爲十二角二分六釐　　昨金融行市、仍持原態、惟星期銀行例假、市場形勢、較爲淸淡、拆息開七分、較前日回小一分、同業拆票轉賬二百三十餘萬、新交易三十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解票欵二千九百餘萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、輛幣交易、成交廣事小洋四萬五千角、其暗盤行情較前日又加起二釐、爲十二角二分六釐、銅元成交二萬零四百串合法幣六千八百元、證券　紐約股市升降沒尚微　　新豐洋行報告昨（八日）紐的股市、參差微升、高級股票堅定、航空股回漲甚勁、煤油股需要良好、交通與鋼鐵股頗爲挺秀、小交易所股票上落互見、債市步漲、半日成交一百二十五萬股、道瓊斯紐的指數列左、紗花　美棉同業限價購進　　昨美棉開盤、市况呆滯、各月漲一至四磅音、利物浦消息良好、同業限價買進近期、空戶抵補、故市勢尙形穩定、有若干官員預言、農田案將於下週初在參議院通過、收盤平穩、計現貨不動、期貨漲二至四磅音、英棉現貨不動、期貨漲二三點、印棉先因投機家及期貨商買進而漲、旋以多方買進爲套賣及歐洲出口商賣出所抵銷、計平果爾漲一·二五至一·五羅比、奧姆辣漲二·五羅比、白羅溪漲一·七五至三羅比、原電錄左、（八日電）　　又據孟買電、十日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲一百九十六羅比、較上日收盤跌一羅比、糧食　薄稻厚粳北銷轉暢　　（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到二十餘號、（貨共四千餘石）、銷塲略動、靑島天津等帮包胃、採去厚粳一千餘包、薄稻近二千包、故疲憊市况、遂以到稀而拔起、蘇同粳回上五分、南港早稻升一角、薄稻更以供不數求、高料　提角半、中市者允增二角外、杜洋尖則定、陰變元仍以胃香見好尺許、　　（滬北）來源二十七八號、市上各貨去胃、白粳早市店銷平常、午市轉佳、市形定立、早稻平定、薄稻津胃續化、價形定勢、羊尖零化滯細、市價高定、中决疲小近角、客尖交易呆木、陰變元銷路滯弱、價亦疲軟、其餘各貨與前市相仿、　　又本市米號業同業公會九日公議米價列左、糖市　本市洋糖存底續減五金　鎳格爾市況堅挺　　雲南造幣廠來滬採辦　　鎳格爾市面、因四川、福州諸帮停辦、本埠爐坊作不進、市象異常呆滯、故業此者頗爲悲觀、惟自新幣制實行之後、鎳格爾銷路、遂於無形中帶起不少、前昨兩日、雲南造幣廠託本埠某洋行購辦數百擔、故市况頓佳、行情亦比前挺硬、計每擔開二百八十五元、惟市貨不多、執貨者心意堅硬、後市行情、大有續漲之勢云、專件　　棉種法及施行條例草案（續）　　第四條）一切　用棉籽、在國內銷售者、無論數量大小、皆需在包裝外或繫之牌上註明售品標識、其形式另以條例規定之、並說明以下各點、　售種者姓名及住址、　種子產地、　品種名稱、　品種等級、　檢定合格證書號數、　檢定結果、一、純度、二、發芽率、三、品種混雜、四、受損種子、（第五條）自法令公布之日起，凡出售種用棉籽者、必須向各該省棉產改進所或相等機關請領執照、吾則不得出售、（第六條）請領執照者、須在收穫之後、將所種品種植株及種子之樣品送交檢定、必要時並舉行繁殖試騐、經檢定合格、並確定品質名實相符者、始得發給執照、（第七條）出售棉籽、如有作偽朦混致與所稱品種之性狀及檢定合格標準不符者、查出立即撤銷執照、不准出售、（第八條）凡種用棉子規定分爲特等檢定種及頭等檢定種兩級、其品質經檢定後、認爲較劣於頭等檢定種之最低標準者、列入劣級、不得出售、（第九條）凡發芽率低於法定標準檢定及不合格之棉籽、概不得用作種子、（未完）啟事　　王宗培·李衡之·何冰·陳鴻根·森禹·祠森諸君鑒、一月份稿費、業已結淸、請自本月十六日起至廿日止、每日下午二時至四時憑本部寄上之酬金單向本館會計處具領爲荷　　經濟專刋編輯部啟</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言亡國的心理  皮　　　　近據某報載，華北風雲，日益緊急，冀察當局，雖嘗逞一時意氣，作分崩離析之事，但環境與良心主宰，不容其脫離母體，卽負責首腦，亦雅不願冒天下之大不題，大有進退維谷，騎虎難下之勢云云。　　我謂天下之孽，多由自作，鄰國雖强，决不足以亡我國家，所能亡我國家者，卽畏首畏尾，偷安茍且的心理，每遇一事，往往因循坐誤，取巧弄乖，只知個人權利，不願大局安危，只知四面討好，不惜委曲求全，旣無判斷能力，又乏奮勇决心，如此心理，遍於一社會，則一社會亡，遍於一種族，則一種族亡，遍於一國家，則一國家亡，國家之亡，猶可挽救，而此種性習之亡，則永世而不能超生。　　華北情形，已到如此局面，而華北當局，猶依違兩可，進退失據，語曰，當斷不斷，反受其亂，一個人處世立身，當識大體，不能專以狡猾取巧，爲能盡一己之責任也。為巧格力姑娘公演覆幾位劇評家並宣布我的計劃  向培良　　　增刊因沒有固定的篇幅，往往指定的稿子不能如願刊出，譬如李一先生的「巧格力姑娘」評是三日送來的，却遲至六日見報，所以當接到了向培良先生的「爲巧格力姑娘公演覆幾位劇評家並宣佈我的計劃」的文章後，就直接寄李一失生，如果有何答辯，可以一並付刊，在時間上是反而提早一點的。現在李一先生的「答向培良君」亦送來了，他們兩位要說的話似乎也止於此了，是非曲直，自有公論，以後任何方面關於「巧格力姑娘」的文章，爲增刋篇幅計，不擬再登，祈原宥是幸。　編者　　巧格力姑娘公演以後幾位劇評家似乎都找着了好材料，仗義執言，以盡其口誅筆伐的責任，這原來是一椿好現像，假如他們是能夠再看淸楚一點戲劇，再少發一點空議論。　　這幾位先生的一致要求，或者可以說是一致的命令，似乎要我站到舞臺上去喊「怒吼罷中國」，或者喊「打倒帝國主義」。這也是一正當之至，好聽之至的說法，問題都是，我是一個從事於戲劇工作的人，我假如有什麼要表現的，我希望用戲劇表現出來。至於在紙上面喊，口頭上喊，究竟有什麼效力，那就只有那幾位劇評先生們可以知道了。　　他們比我聰明得多，永遠明白「看報的人總此看戲的人多」這一條眞理。所以他們要把演劇的成績搬到紙上面去，所以他們連舞臺監督，舞臺裝置，領袖演員等類的名詞都不知道也可以寫劇評，劇本沒有看過也可以寫劇評。因爲一切是非黑白都可以任意搬到紙上。他們又非常聰明知道可以用任何筆名在報紙上發表文字，以避免負任何責任。所以我很希望能够和那些不躲在紙背後的人們談談戲劇。　　我的態度，很顯明地宣佈出來，是「一貫」地反對以「觀念」的見地來議論戲劇。我希望從舞臺的見地來議論戲劇。但是這些劇評先生們的眼光却不見得比少數毫無學識的檢查員之類高明。他們好像要强迫人家「一貫」地遵從他們的意旨。否則便極盡其口誅筆伐之能事。但是可惜他們僅能在氏面上「反」和「吼」。也不得不向我要一張贈券好坐到池座裏也好，「笑」也好，「哭」也好！請在舞臺上拿出成績來。　　十八年有人提議把劇團聯盟加入爭自由大同盟，首先反對的就是我。這歷史，這些劇評先生們恐怕不及知道了。而且，因爲這一議案未曾通過，那幾位提倡意識的老前輩就不惜破壞這一個組織。而上海的戲劇界至今沒有組織。戲劇界內情，我可以說沒有不知道的。一些買空賣空的口頭話，似乎不再拿到我面前來賣弄了。　　卽如，這次上演的成績，以佈景爲最不能使我們自己滿意。因為承包佈景的人掉了一點槍花，以至色彩，圖案，形式都不如原來的計畫，而這些劇評先生們偏偏十分贊美，其淺薄可想而知了。他們說不知道「巧格力姑娘」劇本的意義，甚至於以爲「沒有諷刺」甚至於同時說這劇本不能演，又在數行之後特別提出他的一位名人朋友的意見來，說是「劇本」。這無非是笑得太多，把腦經笑掉了。又沒有人耳提面命，說是巧格力姑娘一方面描寫四個女性的典型，一方面描寫都市生活之不合理。其中也有對於印像畫派的頗爲刻薄的諷刺，因爲原作成功時正當印像畫派之初興。愛克多，保羅，惠理湘三個，是多麼顯明地諷刺了上海的一班靑年呀（但是我抱歉得很，要求這幾位劇評先生們反省一下，是否屬於這三個典型中的那一個。）不過著者巧妙地來了一個喜劇的結尾，沒有大聲疾呼地告訴劇評先生們說：「這也許就是諷刺你們的。」於是他們都在笑聲中忘記一切了。　　我前面說過反對所謂意識之類的話。不過我有時候也談到，那就是徘戲之先，告訴學生們那是屬於那一類的劇本，使他們腦經裏有點記憶的綫索而已。所以，我不久（大約在一個月以內）以後，要再公演我自己所寫的三個獨募劇：從人間來，黑暗中的紅光，他們四個。第一個是無論什麼先生們用極巧妙的說法也找不到半點意識的。不過我在排演之先也許要拼命找到一種藉口，以便學生們易於瞭解。第二個是藝術劇社以爲最有意識的劇本，因此才想到找我加入的。第三個是我自認爲在我的劇本中技巧最完成的一個，那可以說最有意識，也可以說最沒有意識，全待這幾位劇評先生們去替我編造。但是我還有一點最低限度的請求，請先看了我的劇本再開口，莫又弄出笑話來。答向培良君  李一　　　日間，在報上讀到一篇向培良君的「爲巧克力姑娘公演答莫思君」。晚上，我又接到由申報轉來的向培良君的大作：「爲巧克力姑娘公演覆幾位劇評家並宣佈我的計劃。」並附短信，說是：「足下所寄之「巧克力姑娘」評，刻已引起向培良君之反嚮，茲特奉上。設足下有甚一答辯，請於日內擲下！庶可一併發刊，以利讀者。」</p>

<p>我的那篇「巧克力姑娘」既已闖了禍，引起了儼然以「戲劇前輩」自居的向培良君的反響，自然，我是應該來申辯幾句的。　　說向培良君儼然以「戲劇前輩」自居，那我並沒有絲毫冤枉他，不信，且看吧——　　「莫思君少年英俊，有志於戲劇，這是很好的」。「十八年有人提議把劇團聯盟加入爭自由大同盟，首先反對的就是我」。——這一段是非但自我宣傳爲「戲劇前輩」，更且是有（丑表功）的意義的，理宜得賞，以昭大功。但是抱歉得很，向培良君雖然儼然以「戲劇前輩」自居，而不知進退的後生小子，却還是想答辯幾句。明知這是罪該萬死，未免有使「戲劇前輩」（？）難堪，然而在「戲劇前輩」（？）四字還沒有就是等於「絕對的對」之前，我還是要答辯幾句的。　　向培良君的那篇大作，除了想給批評「巧克力姑娘」的人，戴上一頂帽子之外，歸納起來可以分爲下面幾點：　　　向培良君是主張「假如有什麽要表現得，我希望用戲劇表現出來。至於在紙面上喊，口頭上喊，究竟有什麽效力，那就只有幾位劇評先生們可以知道」。所以「無論「吼」也好，「反」也好，「笑」也好，「哭」也好，——請在舞臺上拿出成績來」。（向培良君是明知道「幾位劇評先生」「在舞臺上」拿不出「成績來」的。）　　　「劇本沒有看過也可以寫劇評」？（據說是「因爲一切是非黑白都可以任意搬到紙上」。）　　　據向培良君說是「這次上演的成績，以佈景爲最不能使我們自己滿意。因爲承包佈景的人掉了一點槍花，（以一個「戲劇前輩）自居的人居然會被承包佈景的人「掉了一點槍花」，那眞是莫測高深之至）。以至色彩，圖案，形式，都不如原來的計劃，而這些劇評先生們偏偏十分贊美」，於是證明「其淺薄可想而知了」。　　　向培良君「耳提面命」（好一個「戲劇前輩」的架子。）說是「巧克力姑娘劇本的意義」不是「沒有諷刺。「說是巧克力姑娘一方面描寫四個女性的典型，一方面描寫都市生活之不合理。其中也有對於印象畫派的頗爲刻薄的諷刺」。　　關於牽涉到列位寫「巧克力姑娘」劇評的文字，這裏不談。這裏要說的是一些與我那篇「巧克力姑娘」有關的話。　　關於第一點，我不想再拿「要批評烹調好壞，先得自己會做廚子」的老例來再舉。這裏我祗是看到，主張「用戲劇表現出來」的向培良君，原來是這麼一個人物。我眞是把以前的向培良君佔價得太高了。　　第二點，向培良君是一個「沒有看過劇本，」就「不准寫劇評」論著。（根據「命令」，寫影評就得設法看了分幕脚本再寫，不然都是把「是非黑白任意搬到紙上」。）照向培良的意思，「劇本沒有看過」，就「寫劇評」，那正是和沒有看遍天下的一切書做編輯而登載了抄襲稿件同樣，是殺不可赦的罪惡。　　固然，我們並不否認讀過了劇本以後，對於那個劇本是更能詳盡地加以批判。　　至於說「用任何筆名在報紙上發表文字」，便可以「避免負任何責任」。那大概祗有向培良君非常「聽叨知道」，也大概祗有向培良君是「用任何筆名」以「避免負任何責任」的。　　「劇本沒有看過就不准寫劇評論著」兼「巧克力姑娘舞臺監督」向培良君，以及「巧克力姑娘改編者」兼「巧克力姑娘導演者」陳大悲君，對於「巧克力姑娘」這個劇本，想來是一定研究有素的了。根據「劇本沒有看過就不准寫劇評」這項命令，寫「巧克力姑娘劇評」的，自然是祇好讓向培良君或陳大悲君來寫，這樣，可以「宣佈出「戲劇前輩」的「一貫」的主張來。　　不過，「舞臺監督」的向培良君和「改編兼導演」陳大悲君，雖然說遺憾的沒有寫「巧克力姑娘劇評」，而他們的「一貫」的意見都依舊不難看出來，那就是把「巧克力姑娘」搬上舞臺。而把「巧克力姑娘」搬上舞臺，原來還是「盡力之所能」的。　　「盡力之所能」的「巧克力姑娘」，在儼然以「戲劇前輩」自居的向婄良君雖說是在「耳提面命」的（其實「耳提面命」這四個字，到不如用「面紅耳赤」這四個字，來得妥當貼切。我們所能隱隱地看到的，也正是自以爲是「戲劇前輩」的那種「面紅耳赤」一直紅到耳根的窘態呀。）「說是巧克力姑娘一方面……刻薄的諷刺」。（引文已見上文，茲從略）而眞實實實讓觀衆所見到的是什麼呢？是「她倦於這種生活。要找一個剛強的男子」，是「注意會發生愛情」，是「罵是歡喜打是俏」（見說明書），是……是向觀衆宣示：丟了小職員的位置不要緊，祇要向有錢的小姐低頭，因着裙帶關係，那是會榮任賴丕斯多糖廠的副經理的。是小姐們祇要有錢，再恁性些也不要緊，倔強的保羅結果是不是也做了玩物嗎？　　這些，這些正是「戲劇前輩」們所「耳提面命」的。（也正是「盡力之所能」的。）這些，也正是「戲劇前輩」們認爲並不是「沒有諷刺」的。——這些就是「諷刺」嗎？　　照過去一般論戰的慣例，被批評者最聰明的戰術是「忍痛犧牲」一部份的「癩痢頭兒子」。這樣，把批評爲「比較」好的部份自己「忍痛犧牲」，忍着眼淚說是那是「最不能使自己滿意」的部份，而「劇評先生們偏偏十分贊美」（「十分贊美」？）於是用以證明，「其淺薄可想而知」。　　向培良君也正是那一手，他把別人批評爲「比較可提的到是佈景的顏色」，輕輕地說是「劇評先生們」「十分贊美」「佈景」：而這些，他自己却正是認爲「這次上演的成績，以佈景爲最不能使我們自己滿意」的。這是多巧妙，也多陳舊的手法呀！　　「空議倫」無過，那麼抄一段「十分贊美」的在下面吧：　　「比較可提的到是佈景的顏色，那種淺靑淡黃的顏色，配着這樣輕鬆的劇本，是很合適的。雖然第一二幕的顏色太土，而別的方面也欠眞實一些，不過以淺的顏色來配輕鬆的戲，使人有一種輕盈的感覺，這一點終究是好的。」　　這眞是「十分贊美」的了。不是嗎？上面八十個字裏面，便有一句很合適「和一個「好」」字。　　向先生大概求勝之心太切，所以除了給寄巧克力姑娘劇評者戴上一頂帽子之外，（這戰術也是已經很陳舊的了。）這不知從何說起的說是「也不得不問我要一張贈券好坐到池座裏去」。（這也正是最「聰明」的戰術，較之「投稿不取，用以報復」還要高明，因爲它還能暗示出得了「贈券」者的忘恩負義。可是抱歉得很，這些對我却都是撲了空的，因爲到現在爲止，我還沒有見過「戲劇前輩」向培良先生過。）好像這次指正「巧克力姑娘」的幾個劇評者，都是得了向先生的「贈券」的忘恩負義之徒，或是贈券無券，挾嫌報復。這，向先生正是太高明了。　　至於向培良君的以後「計劃」，這裏爲了篇幅關係，也爲了向先生是主張在舞臺上拿出成績來的關係，讓以後「用戲劇裏現出來」時再談吧。（對不起，義務宣傳是不做了。）　　過去我有一個錯悮的觀念，以爲向先生平常對戲劇是至少有過一番研究的」，這次看了他的「負責作的」，並且是「盡力之所能」作的「巧克力姑娘」之後，我才恍然以前未免把向培良君估價得過高。所謂「戲劇前輩」也者，本來原祇有這麼一套（這一次祇是現了原形而已。）和另一「戲劇前輩」陳大悲君比較起來，是高明不了多少的。這樣，這兩位「戲劇前輩」的合作，自然還有誰會說是「罪孽深重」呢！向培良君請放一百二十個心罷。播音口琴　　中華口琴會　　福音（八四〇）下午七時至七時半　　奮起救國　（大合奏）　　太湖船變奏曲　（二重奏）（張肇熙）　　思鄉曲　（顧龍泉）（大合奏）　　　諾波城小夜曲（短調）　南歐民謠（加魯利）　（王慶隆）　　大軍進行曲　（大合奏）歌唱　　夜鶯藝社　　富星（九二〇）下午五時到五時三刻　　鮮花新婚　（曼娜）　　賣花女　（流朗）　　晚香玉　（露茜）　　滿目凄涼　（曼娜）　　畢業歌　（流朗）　　鐵蹄下的歌女　（露茜）　　明梅團　　華美（一〇六〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　梅娘曲　（雨焚）　　賣花女　（純美）　　儉德歌　（張素貞）　　飄泊者　（雨焚）　　晚香玉　（純美）　　孤兒淚　（張素貞）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Following the Smooth Transition of the Hebei-Chahar Negotiations, Preliminary Discussions Will Commence <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Song Briefly Discussed Negotiation Procedures Yesterday; Xiao Stayed in Tianjin to Inquire About the Japanese Perspective; Watada Departed Beiping for Shenyang, Then Traveled to Lushun</p>
<p>The Liaison Method Between the Japanese Army and Navy in North China Has Been Largely Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Beiping: Regarding the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue, representatives from both China and Japan have repeatedly exchanged views in Tianjin, leading to substantial progress. After Doihara arrived in Beiping yesterday, it was decided that preliminary discussions would continue in Beiping with us. Chen Zhongfu, Chairman of the Diplomatic Committee, is scheduled to visit Doihara tomorrow for the first round of discussions. Once satisfactory results are achieved, formal negotiations can commence. The scope of these discussions will initially focus on the Hebei Eastern issue. After resolving this, negotiations on the Chahar Northern incident will continue. Xiao Zhenying originally planned to come to Beiping with Zhu today, but due to unforeseen circumstances, it has been rescheduled for the day after tomorrow. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Although key figures from China and Japan have traveled to Beiping for negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar incident, shifting the center of attention superficially, differing opinions from certain factions and the moderate stance of the Tianjin Military Department still hold significant importance. Lieutenant Colonel Ishii, a senior staff officer of the Tianjin Japanese Military Department, traveled to Guanwai on the 5th to meet with Commander Minami Jiro of the Kwantung Army to exchange views. He returned to Tianjin by plane on the 9th. A clear statement is expected from Japan soon, which Xiao Zhenying will convey to Song. Whether the two sides' opinions can converge immediately, leading to the start of negotiations, remains uncertain. Therefore, it is premature to hold overly optimistic views at this time. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar issue will begin in Beiping soon. Song Zheyuan and Chen Zhongfu briefly discussed the extent of the negotiations with Doihara and others during a banquet on the 9th. Chen Zhongfu is scheduled to visit Doihara on the 10th for the first meeting in Beiping. It is reported that Song has telegraphed Xiao Zhenying, ordering him to come to Beiping soon to take charge of the proceedings. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Xiao Zhenying is scheduled to go to Beiping on the 12th to convey the opinions of the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters on the Hebei Eastern matter. He plans to visit Nagami, the Chief of Staff of the Garrison, on the 10th to inquire about everything. There is no definite date for the formal negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar issue in Beiping. Chen Zhongfu will still engage with Doihara in a private capacity to bring their opinions closer before proceeding with formal discussions. However, Yin Rugeng opposes the cancellation of the puppet government and is keen to remain the "King of Hebei Eastern" permanently. He has recently been actively drafting laws for the puppet organization, several of which have already been promulgated. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: After arriving in Beiping last night, Song Zheyuan went to the Political Committee this morning to handle official business. Guo Zhihan, Director of the Finance Department, and Ge Dingyuan, Secretary-General, paid separate visits to report on recent government affairs. At noon, Song hosted a banquet at the committee building for Watada, Commander of the Japanese Naval Port in Lushun, and invited Imai, Military Attaché of the Japanese Embassy, Kuwahara, Naval Attaché, and Qin Dechun and Chen Zhongfu to accompany him. The guests and hosts parted on good terms around 1:00 PM. Watada is scheduled to leave Beiping for Shenyang tonight. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: At 12:00 noon on the 9th, Song Zheyuan hosted a banquet for Watada at the Diplomatic Building, inviting key figures from China and Japan, including Doihara, Imai, Kuwahara, Qin Dechun, and Chen Xigeng, to accompany him. They engaged in lively discussions on Sino-Japanese issues, and the gathering concluded happily at 1:30 PM. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Rear Admiral Watada, Commander of the Japanese Naval Port in Lushun, is scheduled to leave Beiping on the night of the 9th via the Beiping-Shenyang train. He will not stop in Tianjin and will return to Guanwai directly. (9th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Watada came to Beiping and Tianjin to discuss with Tada, Nagami, Doihara, and others the liaison methods between the Japanese Army and Navy stationed in North China. It is reported that a general agreement has been reached. With this matter concluded, he is scheduled to go to Shenyang at 9:15 PM on the evening of the 9th, then travel to Lushun.

<p>Beiping: Zhang Zizhong visited Song this morning to report on the recent situation in Chahar Province. It is reported that Zhang will stay in Beiping for two or three days before returning to Zhangjiakou. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Beiping: Due to financial issues, the Hebei-Chahar authorities recently deemed it necessary to engage with the Central Government. They specially dispatched Lei Sishang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau of Beiping City, and Xu Shiying, Group Leader of the Finance Department of the Political Committee, to Nanjing yesterday, carrying a personal letter from Song to Kong, to present their case. Lei and his party are scheduled to return to Beiping next week. (9th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanjing: According to an economic scholar, at the beginning of the implementation of the new monetary policy, Minister of Finance Kong announced the entire plan, which includes not only monetary reform but also the transformation of finance and the reorganization of finances. The success of these three elements is mutually beneficial and inseparable. If the silver standard is not abandoned, the state of financial tightening cannot be changed. If financial institutions cannot be transformed, the financial situation will inevitably deteriorate. Recognizing this, the government will follow monetary reform with the unification and revitalization of two public bonds: one to postpone the principal repayment period of old debts, making the state treasury revenue and expenditure suitable and facilitating financial reorganization, and the other to increase funds, enabling the support of production and sound financial organizations, making it easy to start transforming finance. At the same time, the Central Bank Law will be revised as the basis for improving the banking system. All of these measures are indeed to complete the new monetary policy and work hard to implement the entire plan. The people of the country should sincerely support it in order to seek national economic revival. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance has completed its investigation into the speculative craze on the stock exchange and has decided to allow it to resume trading soon.

<h3 id="e15">Song Zheyuan's Attitude and the Situation in North China <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Hebei-Chahar Political Committee Chairman Song Zheyuan's attitude has become the focus of national concern in recent months. Since December of last year, Song has repeatedly declared (1) not to submit to others, (2) to absolutely obey the Central Government, and (3) to have no secret agreements with foreign countries. These declarations should certainly be regarded as Song's declaration of self-love and patriotism after shouldering the heavy responsibility of Hebei and Chahar. However, there are also many people who suspect that he is seeking understanding from the people of the country in aspects that are contrary to this. This is because the public opinion circles, considering Song's heroic battles at Xifeng two years ago and understanding the hardships of his position, are unwilling to make accusations. However, the people of society, witnessing the daily deterioration of the situation in North China, cannot avoid various speculations spreading among them. Facts are like this, so why be silent? Recently, Song returned to Beiping after visiting his ancestral home in Leling and made a statement to our newspaper reporter on Sino-Japanese negotiations, saying that "the problem between China and Japan is a matter of equality. If one side is a weak country and the other oppresses, it will be difficult to proceed," and so on. If these few words can be regarded as Song's policy for dealing with the situation in North China after the Han-Song meeting, then the people of the country can not only dispel their doubts about Song himself but also slightly reduce their anxiety about the future of North China.</p>
<p>The activities of the military personnel of neighboring countries in North China take the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan, and Shandong as a whole target. These five provinces have a total area of 1.02 million square kilometers, accounting for one-eleventh of the total land area, and a population of 81 million, accounting for one-sixth of the national population. Although the area is slightly inferior to the four northeastern provinces, the population is nearly three times that. If such a vast land and numerous people are threatened, the relationship with the life of the country need not be said. For several months, the whole country has been in panic. The people of the country are clear about the seriousness of this situation. However, according to the recent situation, Shandong Province is struggling to the east, and Shanxi and Suiyuan are barely holding on to the west. The future depends on how the Hebei-Chahar authorities finally deal with it to determine the situation. Those who now regard North China as hopeless are inevitably falling into excessive pessimism. In fact, although the pressure on Shandong, Shanxi, and Suiyuan is great, if the authorities can continue to support themselves with the attitude they have maintained for the past few months, it is hoped that the Hebei-Chahar area can be preserved. If Chairman Song has facts to prove what he says, then the words "equality" and "difficult to proceed if one side oppresses" are vague in wording but of great importance in their relationship. Those who dance awkwardly and try to show off may not even be able to satisfy their desires. The reporter dares not be overly optimistic about the situation in North China, but the current situation is not impossible to reverse. Those who are responsible should make efforts now, and things can still be done. Therefore, based on Song's talks, I have elaborated on my observations, hoping that those who have the responsibility to reverse the situation will not miss the opportunity again.</p>

The Allied Powers' seizure of German colonies violated the International Congo Treaty. This must be clearly understood before talks on raw materials can achieve satisfactory results. Germany's restoration of its old colonies is a matter of German honor. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris: The issue of re-allocating resources and colonies raised by the British House of Commons has aroused great attention here. Nationalist newspapers have severely criticized it.</p>
<p>The "Atari" newspaper said that the redistribution of resources is the redistribution of colonies, so the economic and political aspects of this issue are closely related. Therefore, the newspaper completely opposes this plan and said that Britain still holds the world's raw material resources and can still be called a hegemon at sea, so Britain wants to block the coast, and Britain can do it alone. The "Navru" newspaper said that the fair redistribution of resources or colonies must take into account the needs of each country and the position of each country. If this point cannot be implemented, then the issue of redistributing world resources and colonies cannot be implemented. The rest of the newspapers are largely the same, all ending with this point, but many take this opportunity to attack Germany's imperialist ambitions. (8th National News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Washington, Today it was learned that President Roosevelt is preparing to convene representatives of all democratic nations of North and South America for a meeting here soon, to "organize a peace mechanism for the Western Hemisphere." The main purpose of this decisive meeting will be to adjust existing peace treaties in order to implement President Roosevelt's "Good Neighbor Policy" and to prevent Western Hemisphere nations from being dragged into wars elsewhere.

<p>Washington, Assistant Secretary of State Welles (in charge of Latin American affairs) met yesterday with the ambassadors of various Latin American countries to the United States (Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Guatemala, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Panama) to discuss the convocation of a Pan-American Peace Conference. People generally believe that the scope of this conference will be broad, not merely limited to resolving the Chaco dispute and delineating the borders between Ecuador and Peru. President Roosevelt believes that, with the threat of war in Europe, it is necessary for the nations of the Americas to unite. Therefore, he advocates convening a Pan-American Conference to discuss this matter. According to some observers, President Roosevelt believes that once war breaks out, trade between Europe and the Americas will inevitably be affected. Therefore, he advocates that South American nations should cooperate closely to find new markets for American goods so that business activities will not be interrupted. South American diplomats also believe that the Pan-American Conference will boost American commerce and allow American nations to form a united front, thereby safeguarding their maritime trade and neutral rights in the event of war in Europe. Regarding the timing of the conference, some suggest holding it in the spring or summer of this year. However, most believe that it would be better to wait until mid-August after the new presidents of Paraguay and Bolivia have taken office, as the terms of the current presidents are expiring and elections will soon be held. The United States will be represented by Secretary of State Hull at that time. (8th, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e43">Parisian Newspaper Comments on the International Situation: Franco-Soviet Treaty Maintains Collective Security, Believes Anglo-French Understanding is Essential <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The newspaper published an editorial commenting on the international situation and emphasizing the need for an understanding between Britain and France. Referring to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, it stated, "The conclusion of this treaty, from the perspective of France's policy, is neither an innovation nor does it represent a novel trend. Its purpose is to strengthen the structure of the security system, not to target any particular nation. This system, although subject to criticism from various quarters, is the cornerstone of French foreign policy. However, even if this system is based on the principles of the League of Nations and gains solid support within a broad framework, it will still be difficult to achieve anything without a solid understanding between Britain and France. In this dense fog of the international situation, Anglo-French understanding is like a ray of dawn, breaking through the heavy fog. The more Britain strengthens its military, the stronger this understanding becomes. All peace-loving people should hope for close friendship between Britain and France, so that peace may be within reach." (8th, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e44">On the Far East Question: Delicate Relations Between Britain, Japan and America; Anglo-American Alliance to Restrain Japan Possible, US-Japan Naval Arms Race Intensifies <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Special dispatch from the Huazhao News Agency. In the London Naval Disarmament Conference, Japan demanded military equality from Britain and the United States, but Britain and the United States only recognized military equality between themselves, while maintaining military superiority over Japan. Thus, a head-on collision occurred between Britain and the United States and Japan, leading Japan to withdraw from the disarmament conference. After Japan's withdrawal, the issue of Britain, America, and Japan's relationship with China has a significant impact, which we should pay attention to. Japan's priority in China affairs has always been avoiding joint protests from Britain and the United States, especially regarding the North China issue. Therefore, Japan resolutely separated the North China issue from the disarmament conference, perhaps fearing that Britain and the United States would use the joint stance of restraining Japan from the disarmament conference to jointly interfere in Japan's China policy. This is why Japan was eager to withdraw from disarmament.</p>
<p>Recently, many believe that Britain and Japan can cooperate on the China issue. However, in reality, a British-Japanese alliance on China is difficult to achieve. Although Britain desires to develop in China, it may seem advantageous to collude with Japan, making an alliance with the United States unnecessary. But if Britain colludes with Japan on the China issue, Japan would inevitably demand the opening of British colonies in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America. The conflicting interests of Britain and Japan in these areas are deep, and Britain's gains would hardly compensate for its losses. Therefore, it is virtually impossible for Britain to conclude an agreement with Japan on the China issue. However, Britain is also unable to seize the Chinese market alone, making it impossible for it to compete with Japan single-handedly. As a result, people are convinced that Britain and the United States will inevitably join forces to deal with Japan, seeking to divide China through their combined strength. Some believe that Britain will take the same accommodating attitude towards Japan's aggression in China as it did towards Italy's seizure of Abyssinia, as suggested by the former British Foreign Secretary, and propose partitioning China. But this is not the case. If the United States withdraws from China, it will immediately affect the security of India. Britain has already lost the market of the Roman Empire to Japan. Therefore, if Britain withdraws from China, it will, in effect, withdraw from East Asia, allowing Japan to seize it.</p>
<p>Based on the above, Britain and the United States have a common need to jointly restrain Japan on the China issue. However, this cannot be achieved because of the conflict between Britain and the United States over the silver issue in China, which creates a favorable opportunity for Japan. The United States' policy of purchasing silver has severely damaged the Chinese economy, and Britain, standing behind China, has also suffered from the impact of the US silver policy. China's currency reform and abolition of the silver standard are reportedly an addition to the Sterling bloc, which is Britain's response to the US silver policy. The price of silver has fallen from three pence to two pence, a drop of 30%. The United States has had to recognize Britain's advantage in China. In the future, it may continue to adopt the Open Door policy in China to maintain its inherent Far East policy and show increasing signs of compromise with Britain. Furthermore, to protect its vested interests in China, Britain cannot restrain Japan alone without cooperating with the United States. Therefore, Britain and the United States are likely to jointly confront Japan on the North China issue. Another factor centered on China is the preparation for competition. In the future, an arms race between Japan and the United States will be inevitable.</p>
<p>As for the arms race, Britain advocates a "small warship, large number" policy, while the United States favors a "35,000-ton or greater" Japanese warship policy. Japan also plans to build 50,000-ton battleships to show resistance. Japan's budget for this year is as high as 1.27 billion yuan. Even if we only consider the increase in its military spending, it will inevitably reach around 2.5 billion yuan in the next two or three years. This will have a significant impact on the expansion of financial expenditures, inevitably leading to a larger budget deficit. As a result, Japan, in order to confront Britain and the United States with its China policy, must expand its naval and land forces. Although its military industry may experience distorted development, the illusion of "both soldiers and farmers" will not be achieved. It will inevitably sacrifice the balanced development of general industries, and Japan's economic crisis is now bound to deepen.</p>

<p>Tokyo, After withdrawing from the naval disarmament conference, Japan fears that Britain and the United States will cooperate to interfere in Japan's actions in China. It is therefore making every effort to separate Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East. Since the end of last year, Foreign Minister Hirota has repeatedly instructed Ambassador Saito in the United States to discuss the issue of concluding a political agreement between Japan and the United States with US Secretary of State Hull to ensure the division of power between Japan and the United States in the Pacific. US Ambassador to Japan conveyed Secretary of the Navy Swanson's theory of dividing the Pacific between Japan and the United States to Japan. Japan is now negotiating with the United States, proposing to use the 180-degree meridian as the dividing line between the spheres of influence of Japan and the United States, in order to prevent Anglo-American cooperation in the Far East.

<p>Tokyo, As tensions rise in the Far East, Tokyo is abuzz with rumors that Britain will lend money to the Soviet Union and the United States will assist the Soviet Union with armaments. However, the increasing enthusiasm of Britain and the United States in studying the Soviet Union is directly proportional to the increasing severity of the situation in the Far East, with the United States showing the most enthusiasm. The most obvious example is that, although American Hollywood films, the kingdom of capitalist movies, sell well worldwide, Soviet films with a new ideology are selling very well in the United States. Major cities such as New York, Washington, Baltimore, and Pittsburgh are showing Soviet films, and attendance is setting unprecedented records. In addition, the American-Soviet Association is exhibiting Soviet art, such as new works and paintings, in Washington and other cultural cities. Famous universities such as Columbia and Harvard are offering Russian language courses. Every year, intellectuals, educators, and writers are constantly visiting the Soviet Union. Furthermore, elementary and secondary schools in various American cities are showing Soviet films on natural science, hygiene, and industry as educational tools. US-Soviet relations are also becoming increasingly prosperous. (9th, Hualian News)</p>

<p>Tokyo, The Japanese and "Manchukuo" governments have lodged strong protests with the Soviet government regarding the Jinchan Gou incident on the eastern Soviet border, where Manchurian troops were disturbed. At the same time, the relevant authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army, and the Navy have carefully discussed measures to avoid border disputes between Russia and "Manchukuo." It is believed that to prevent border disputes, the borders must be demarcated. Japan and "Manchukuo" have proposed to the Soviet government to establish a border demarcation committee in order to demarcate the border line and conduct consultations. However, the Soviet government issued a reply at that time, stating that the border had already been demarcated by treaty and that there was no need to establish a committee to carry out demarcation. As a result, the establishment of the committee failed. However, the recent frequent disputes in the border area are clearly due to the unclear border line, which has led to various ominous incidents. Therefore, the Japanese and "Manchukuo" governments reiterated the above situation, stating that if the Soviet government has sincerity in preventing border disputes, it should first erect signs or barbed wire, etc., in the border areas where disputes frequently occur, clearly demarcating the border line between the two countries to prevent the recurrence of disputes. They will urge the Soviet side to reconsider this matter. (9th, Domei News)</p>

<p>Tokyo, Promoting cultural diplomacy is one of the major items of Japan's diplomatic policy for 1936. Foreign Minister Hirota has strongly advocated this point in his diplomatic address to the 68th Diet. In order to determine the specific details of promoting cultural diplomacy, since the beginning of this month, Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira, Ambassador to China Arita, and Ambassador to Germany Mushanokoji have been at the center of careful discussions. As a result, it has been decided to allocate 1 million yen for international cultural projects, and the main points of the major projects for this year have been decided as follows:</p>
<p>"Cultural Work in the Americas" In early April, Envoy Matsunaga will be dispatched to North America to tour Canada, Mexico, and Central and South American countries to conduct specific investigations into cultural cooperation and friendship between these New World countries and Japan. "Cultural Work in Europe" Ambassador Matsudaira, who will return to London in March, will convene the second meeting of ambassadors and ministers to Europe in London to conduct various adjustments in political and economic matters. At the same time, he must also implement friendship and cooperation with various countries in culture to make further efforts. Japanese cultural libraries should be established in major cities around the world. There is a strong desire in major cities of various countries to study Japanese culture, so Japanese cultural libraries should be established to facilitate research and enable people to thoroughly explore the essence of Japanese culture. All preparations should be made. The cities currently planned for the opening of libraries are as follows: New York, San Francisco, Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris, Berlin, Bangkok, Sydney, etc. (9th, Domei News)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Ambassador to Britain Tsuneo Matsudaira has returned to his post after his home leave. In order to adjust Anglo-Japanese relations after the breakdown of the naval conference, he has decided to go to London to assume his duties. He has consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other related authorities. After returning to his post, he plans to promote active measures towards Britain and will meet with former Ambassador to China, Arita, and Sir Otto Niemeyer, who will visit Japan on his way home, to communicate his intentions. He will return to his post in London in mid-March with Foreign Minister Hirota's instructions for Anglo-Japanese harmony. After returning to his post, the ambassador will convene the second meeting of European ambassadors in London to convey Japan's recent fundamental foreign policy and establish mutual communication. He will also represent Japan in the coronation ceremony of Edward VIII. As for the Minister Eden, he will gradually conclude an Anglo-Japanese agreement on trade areas and request British recognition of Japan's East Asian policy. The naval conference must remain unchanged from beginning to end, and the traditional friendly relations between Britain and Japan must be strengthened and expanded. (9th, Domei News)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Oil Embargo Against Italy is Likely to be Implemented: Observations of London Insiders <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>However, the approach taken may not be too severe. The report of the League of Nations experts will be published soon.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of an oil embargo against Italy, according to observations from oil industry and banking experts in London, it is inevitable that discussions will soon turn into action. However, it is predicted that the implementation will not be too severe, so as not to cause the Italian army's supplies to run out. According to technicians with well-informed sources known to this reporter, this is the first time that there is such clear evidence. They also said that the League of Nations, at this time, must implement embargo measures to maintain its prestige, which is not only entirely possible but also its bounden duty. As for the implementation of the oil embargo, it is generally believed that the United States will continue to supply Italy with oil. Therefore, Italy should not regard the embargo as a cause for declaring war and immediately take military action. Furthermore, several organizations supporting the League of Nations in London today issued a declaration demanding that the League of Nations implement an oil embargo, be decisive and not be constrained by the resolutions of the US Congress regarding new neutrality laws, and hesitate. Political figures believe that, judging from the current situation, the cabinet will definitely satisfy the wishes of these organizations. However, people generally believe that if an embargo is implemented, Mussolini can tacitly agree to it within certain limits. Beyond these limits, he will become furious and cause unforeseen disasters. Therefore, there will probably be no resolution until the sanctioning nations understand these limits. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>Geneva, The report on the oil embargo against Italy, compiled based on the opinions of the small subcommittees on the benefits and harms of the oil embargo, will be published by the Committee of Eighteen next week. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Geneva, The committee of experts on the oil embargo, appointed by the Committee of Eighteen of the League of Nations, is currently drafting a report, which is expected to be released in early next week. At that time, it will be sent to the member states of the League of Nations, and a separate copy will be sent to the United States. According to people in the League of Nations, the expert committee is not an official body of the League of Nations, and there is no other intention in this move. It should not be interpreted too harshly. Because the United States is the world's largest oil producer, it is necessary to notify it. This reporter also believes that notifying the United States should not be seen as an invitation for the United States to participate in the embargo, as the US Congress is currently discussing neutrality issues. If it were to immediately invite it to participate in the embargo, it would inevitably be seen as clumsy. (8th, Havas)</p>

<p>The Ah Emperor is Safe and Sound</p>
<p>Seven Italian bombers from Taishe flew to Taishe, where the headquarters of the Ah army is located on the Northern Road, and bombarded the city and nearby houses with incendiary bombs and bombs for over an hour. Their purpose was to kill the Ah Emperor. Several bombs fell near the imperial palace, but the Ah Emperor refused to take shelter and remained safe. It is reported that several holes were shot in the Italian planes, but none crashed. The extent of the damage is currently unknown. There have been no reports of any casualties among foreigners. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome, According to a government communiqué issued here, General De Bono, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in Africa, is consolidating the Italian army's already occupied areas. At the same time, the Italian army is pursuing the enemy in the Southern Road towards the River, while there are no reports from the Northern Road front. (8th, Guomin News)</p>
<p>Ah Capital, The Ah army is very strange about the continuous reconnaissance of Italian planes near Doria in recent days. The Italian planes fly to low altitudes without dropping a single bomb. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the Italians want to obtain situational photographs. The Italian planes pay more attention to the situation along the railway line, so they circled in that area for a long time. As the rainy season approaches, King Ah has ordered 30,000 workers to build a road along the railway line from left to right. The Italian troops near Magal are focused on building roads and strengthening defenses. (8th, Guomin News)</p>

<p>Vienna, Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg visited the capitals of Britain and France to discuss the issue of the restoration of the Habsburgs with the authorities of those countries. He has now returned. According to what this reporter has learned, the restorationists here had high expectations for the Deputy Chancellor's trip. They initially believed that Yugoslavia's opposition to the Austrian restoration was deeply rooted. The Vice-Chancellor's meeting with Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the regent of that country, might soften the country's attitude. At the same time, Archduke Otto, the heir to the Habsburgs, is living in exile in Steenokkerzeel, Belgium. The Deputy Chancellor was supposed to visit Belgium to have a face-to-face discussion with the Archduke. However, things turned out unexpectedly, greatly disappointing them. Not only did Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, the regent, avoid meeting with the Deputy Chancellor in Paris, but Archduke Otto also did not meet with the Deputy Chancellor when he visited Paris, believing that a meeting between the two would be inappropriate at this time. In addition, Chancellor Schuschnigg also holds different views on the immediate restoration of the Empire. On the one hand, Archduke Otto is still young, and if he suddenly ascended to the throne, his every word and action would be controlled by the former Queen Zita. On the other hand, Austria's economic difficulties have not yet been overcome, and hasty changes would lead to anger. Yesterday, a restorationist told this reporter that "Archduke Otto should exercise patience at this time," indicating that the Austrian restoration movement has suffered a setback.</p>
<p>Vienna, Today it was learned that after Deputy Chancellor Prince Starhemberg held a series of political meetings in Paris and returned to Austria, the Austrian police immediately launched a nationwide search for communists and National Socialists. Thirty-two National Socialists were arrested here, one of whom was Dr. Kohl, an assistant prosecutor. In addition, several postal and tax officials were arrested. In the Genendau area, twenty communists were arrested. (8th, Guomin News)</p>

It is said that the treasury needs a total of 7,000,000,000 francs in expenses until June of this year. Although treasury bills can continue to be issued to provide funding, it will be difficult to reach this amount, so it is necessary to resort to borrowing. Negotiations are currently underway in London, and their nature is purely technical. He cannot provide a report at this time, but in any case, Parliament will be notified before the loan is finalized. Régnier also said that investors in the domestic financial market are currently taking a wait-and-see attitude, so the government's recent bond issuance has not been enthusiastically subscribed. The government, aware of this, fears that the continued issuance of treasury bills will not be successful. In addition, the Bank of England can lend to the Bank of France at low interest rates, so negotiations are being held with London to borrow. As for the rumors that Britain is using economic interests as an exchange condition, it is completely untrue. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<h3 id="e64">North Atlantic Aviation Route: Plan About to be Realized; Northern Ireland MP to Question British Government <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>London: The plan to open a North Atlantic aviation route is about to be realized. A Northern Ireland MP in the House of Commons will question the government on this matter. As early as 1931, the "Transatlantic Airways" of Northern Ireland attempted to open a commercial aviation route across the North Atlantic to connect air traffic between North America and Northern Ireland. Most countries have spared no effort in researching and designing for their own interests. Countries such as the UK, US, Germany, and the Netherlands were involved in the above plan. In 1933, Germany and the Netherlands withdrew first, leaving only the UK and the US closely monitoring the matter. The Northern Ireland airline originally believed that it would be able to obtain the support of the British Air Ministry to realize its plan. However, the Air Ministry later favored a certain British company, intending to have it undertake the matter and refusing to provide the necessary facilities to the Northern Ireland company. Therefore, the company recently issued a booklet attacking the government, saying that the so-called British company neither possesses seaplanes capable of flying across the Atlantic on schedule nor has the facilities for landing sites. On the contrary, the Irish company has been preparing for the route for a long time, and its formal opening is expected to be realized. Why does the Air Ministry refuse to provide assistance? It is said that the Northern Ireland MP has threatened to raise this issue to the government. (Havas, 8th)</p>

<p>Beirut, Capital of French-controlled Syria: After several days of calm, disturbances have reoccurred. Demonstrations broke out in Damascus today, and the authorities had to use police force to intervene. Students from the National Party-affiliated local university rioted, and the authorities have ordered an indefinite suspension of classes. Hama is currently still peaceful. In Homs, demonstrators attacked the military, throwing stones and shooting. The military did not retaliate, but was eventually able to disperse the demonstrators on the streets and arrest many people. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: Regarding the unrest in the Syrian mandate, the "Petit Parisien" newspaper received news from the capital of Egypt stating that, in addition to the ten deaths in Hama, twelve police officers, fourteen French cavalrymen (including one officer and one adjutant), and many demonstrators were injured in places such as Homs and Damascus. More than fifty people were arrested in Homs. In Damascus, Arab students from the university threw stones at the funeral procession of Christians. Afterwards, they visited the Christian elders to express their apologies. Yesterday morning, many university students threw stones at the residence of Syrian Republic President al-Abid, demanding that the president dismiss several senior officials. In addition, Jerusalem is also experiencing extreme unrest. A group of Arab university students, carrying school flags, paraded through the city, which was intercepted by the police, who seized the flags and arrested the leaders of the student strike committee and many demonstrators. University students have decided to strike in protest. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<p>Capital of Chile: The Chilean government declared a state of siege today. Within ten hours, it had arrested nine hundred people engaged in sedition and strike activities. The local authorities deeply feel that the recent disturbances in the capital and provinces are all due to the activities of the Communist Party. Because the strike movement is spreading rapidly and there are many riots, workers in coal mines, armaments, bread, printing, construction, textiles, etc., all went on strike without warning. Then, without notice, they immediately resumed work, which greatly hindered the country's industry. Although railway workers are still on strike today, the severity has been slightly reduced, as the number of workers returning to work has gradually increased. However, the losses suffered by the railway industry are very significant. There are 31 places where the tracks have been destroyed, 13 trains have been derailed, and there have been two collisions. Other incidents, such as cut power lines, are countless. Today, it is said that seven leaders of the Communist movement were arrested in secret dens and have all been imprisoned. The police claim that they have found evidence that these people were acting on the orders of Moscow. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The government expects a thorough cleanup for the general election, which has entered the third decisive phase, and directs the Interior and Justice ministries to do their utmost to maintain it. This is because the result of this general election will determine the fate of the Okada Cabinet. If the Seiyukai can still obtain an absolute majority, then the cabinet will be in a position where it must resign en masse without convening a special parliament. Therefore, it has a major determination for this decisive election. However, the situation in the electoral districts for the third decisive phase is extremely chaotic, and it is extremely difficult to predict. However, government officials believe that even if the Seiyukai becomes the largest party as a result of the election, the difference in the number of seats from the Minseitō will only be a few, and in fact, the two parties have similar strengths. If they cooperate with parties such as the Showakai and the Kokumin Domei, they can ensure an absolute majority in the parliament and there is no need to worry. They have gradually become reassured by this optimistic speculation and have begun preparing for all situations in the special parliament, ordering the Ministry of Finance, Interior, Agriculture and Forestry, and Commerce and Industry to quickly sort out the bills they will submit to the parliament.

<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtang, Written by Qi Zhi</p>
<p>Long-Absent Hometown Yixing</p>
<p>An Analysis of Rural Poverty</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>I am grateful for this illness of mine—it gave me the opportunity to return to my hometown (and it is my hometown) for a short stay. For the sake of studying (I still don't understand what use those books I read in middle school and university have for me, except for getting a qualification. So it was just 'studying for the sake of studying'.), for the sake of eating, I had to drift around in various cities. Because I was used to seeing neat roads, tall buildings, beautiful shop windows, noble gentlemen, and imposing foreign dignitaries, when I went back to everything in my hometown where I grew up, it seemed very different from the scenes in my childhood memories, which aroused my novel attention.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>It's not entirely because my "horizons are high." Everything in my hometown, in these six or seven years, has changed in many ways. First, in the past, going back always meant taking a train to Wuxi, then a small steamship to Yixing, and then changing to a private boat, which took two days in total. Now it only takes half a day. Whether going back from Nanjing, Shanghai, or Hangzhou, you can take a long-distance bus home from the Jinghang Highway, the Xiyi Highway, and the Yichang (Changzhou) Highway. This is unspeakably convenient for students returning for vacation, merchants rushing on the road, and employees returning to their homes during the holidays. But after all, it has not been able to replace steamships and private boats. Taking a long-distance bus costs almost one cent of silver per mile. One cent of silver is equal to three copper coins, and three copper coins are equal to one large pancake. The cost of taking the bus for more than ten miles can maintain a day's life in the countryside. Thirty or forty miles (or a little more) can be reached by the villagers just by moving their feet. If it is further away, a few hundred cash can be used to take a boat, and on it you can drink tea, chat, and take a nap. Many agricultural products such as rice, sweet potatoes, vegetables, mountain goods, pottery, etc., as well as oil, salt, cloth, etc. from the cities, still rely on shipping. The South has plenty of rivers, and "the five lakes and four seas" are all "free for boats to travel" without spending money. And shipping costs are much lower. Therefore, steamships and scheduled boats still exist, but the equipment is more suitable for the needs of the villagers. As for the price the villagers pay for leaving the fields and leaving the man-made highways, it is just adding some "eye candy": cars like ground tigers, roaring and screaming, foreign women leading foreign dogs, coming and going with her husband, on fine days in spring and autumn, groups of small cars (villagers call private cars small cars to distinguish them from long-distance buses) are full of dignified and gorgeous gentlemen and graceful ladies or young ladies; from time to time, there are entire teams of troops, fully armed, walking or always speeding by on trucks.</p>
<p>Having become accustomed to the tall and majestic ancient city walls of Nanjing, the city walls of Yixing seem like a "fortress" found in northern villages. Inside this city circle, the once seemingly prosperous street when I first entered the city from the countryside—the wide and flat stone-paved road, the neat and uniform gold-lettered signboards, the red lacquer counters, the dazzling array of goods in the display cases—now seems very deserted. The golden and red brilliant colors have faded, because of the long-term erosion of wind and rain without being able to be painted: a few figures in the store are trading in the dim darkness. The bustling villagers who were crowded and shoulder-to-shoulder in the main street are also gone. Everything appears scattered, dim, quiet, and even a little desolate. Walking through a few streets, only a few exceptions were found: several foreign goods stores (like small department stores in Shanghai) are quite developed, completely decorated with the latest style of storefront windows: French Simon cream, Coty perfume, British cold wool fabrics, etc. are displayed with the most attractive patterns, colors and light. In addition, three or four branches of banks have also appeared. This is a newly arrived but very powerful "store," so its buildings are also distinctly black and white, towering majestically. Banks such as Shanghai Bank and Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank mainly operate on agricultural product mortgages, and they have also set up many warehouses in places with convenient transportation in the surrounding countryside, which are used to hold the collateral of the villagers. There are also some occupations that did not exist before, such as newspapers and lawyers, each with several. At first, I thought this was an improvement in the cultural level and legal knowledge of my hometown, but by the time I came out, I had to completely deny it.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>As soon as I returned to the P village where my old residence was, the same old things, especially that way of life, immediately evoked my childhood experiences, making me feel very familiar: doing all kinds of farming, transplanting seedlings, harvesting, planting wheat, and chopping firewood according to the progress of the seasons, without any change; even that piece of rice paddy, mulberry garden, vegetable garden, and even a pile of ashes are the same as before. The population has increased a lot, especially the children. A group of ten or twenty children from three or four years old to ten years old are playing in the sunny corner of the threshing ground. The number of households has also increased. Some who have been running docks and working in factories have also returned to the countryside because of the closure of industry and commerce.</p>
<p>The color of poverty has spread throughout this large village, which has three or four hundred households and was once known for its abundance. Although the nearby area is a place of lime production, the walls are eroded with patches of yellow and black. They have not been plastered for many years, thatched grass is used to repair the holes in the tiled roofs, and vegetable gardens are no longer fenced with bamboo strips or bamboo branches, but with sunflower stalks, mulberry branches, and everything that does not require spending money to buy. Everyone has disheveled hair or long hair, because this can save money on haircuts. There is no such thing as single or lined clothes, they wear whatever they can grab. So-called neatness and cleanliness are never thought of by them. After the great drought the year before last, in the spring and summer seasons of last year (1935), only a dozen families in the whole village ate rice. The rest ate coarse grains or went hungry. This had never happened before. The village elementary school is free of charge, but the number of students is decreasing day by day, because spending one or two yuan on books is an extreme luxury (even a bit of a waste) for them, not to mention that children over ten years old can also help their fathers in the fields to cut grass and deliver meals.</p>
<p>Originally, there were many trees and bamboo forests beside the village houses, but now they are all gone. Nanshan, not far from the village, I remember going to the dense forest in the mountains in spring to find orchids when I was a child. When there was wind, I could hear the pine waves filling the valley, scaring my young partners who thought it was a tiger's roar and screaming. Now they have all become bare, denuded mountains! The trees on the mountains have all been cut down. Needless to say, the villagers are so poor that they can't wait to turn everything that can be turned into cash into money.</p>
<p>The villagers have completely lost their credit due to delays. The village shops will absolutely no longer extend credit, and accommodating loans requires extreme favour or more than 20% interest. Indeed, money is the most lacking thing in the countryside. Poor, poor, that is its whole appearance. I never thought that my hometown—with mountains behind it and water in front of it, "fields crisscrossing," "houses neatly arranged," and "happily self-sufficient" P village—has become so dilapidated in these few years.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Japan-Philippines Association and China-Philippines Association　Philippine Correspondence <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese side is proceeding very rapidly, while we are extremely neglected</p>
<p>The most essential claim of the United States' approval of the Philippine Islands Independence Act is to protect the interests of American farmers. Therefore, the Tydings-McDuffie Independence Act stipulates that "Philippine sugar can be transported to the United States duty-free, not exceeding 850,000 tons per year, coconut oil 200,000 tons, abaca 3 million pounds... After independence is realized, American goods can be shipped to the Philippines, and the United States can collect all import taxes." Sugar, coconut, and abaca are important local products of the Philippine Islands and also the basic source of wealth for the Philippine economy. Judging from the 1933 statistics, these three local products accounted for 88% of the total exports, that is, out of 211,542,105 Philippine pesos, they accounted for 187,550,125 pesos. After the Philippine Islands becomes independent, the United States will adopt a tariff protection policy, and these various local products will be subject to tariff restrictions. How can they be sold to the United States as much as possible? They will inevitably have to find new markets. The targets for finding new markets are China and Japan, because China has a large population and huge consumption, and Japan has a booming industry and a lack of raw materials, both of which can absorb local products from the Philippines. Currently, Filipinos are planning how to transport agricultural products to China and Japan. In the future, in order to realize this plan, it is necessary to vigorously promote China-Philippines friendship and Japan-Philippines friendship, or even conclude a most-favored-nation trade treaty with the two countries, so that China and Japan can absorb their local products as much as possible. If our country's authorities can take this opportunity to contact the Philippine Islands, the status of overseas Chinese in the Philippines can also be slightly consolidated. The Japanese are paying very close attention to this. The Japanese side has always been actively committed to developing Nanyang trade. Now that it encounters this opportunity, how can it easily let it go? Therefore, in the past year, personnel dispatched by the Japanese government and the private sector have come to the Philippines one after another. Their purpose is to connect feelings and communicate culture, and they have established the Japan-Philippines Association in Tokyo, with Duke Tokugawa as the president. When the Philippine autonomous government was established, Japan originally planned to send Duke Tokugawa as a special envoy to the Philippines to celebrate, but it was later stopped because the United States did not want to overdo it. The intentions of both parties can be guessed. Not long ago, the former Japanese ambassador to the Philippines, Horibuchi, went to Australia to return the visit. When he passed through Manila, he mentioned this matter to President Quezon. Quezon said, "After the establishment of the Japan-Philippines Association, preparations will also be made here." Therefore, recently, Japanese residents in the Philippines, together with some Philippine celebrities, jointly organized the Philippine branch of the Tokyo Japan-Philippines Association in Manila. The preparatory office is located at the Japanese consulate, and personnel from the Japanese consulate are in charge of organizing matters. It is expected that after the branch is established, it will communicate information about Japanese-Philippine cultural institutions from time to time, and promote each other's organized tourist groups to visit and investigate education and investigate economic conditions. It is also heard that a few years ago, Japanese residents in the Philippines established the Greater Asia Association Philippine Branch, and in addition to Filipinos and Japanese, there were also Indians joining. In January of this year, the Greater Asia Association hosted a Japan-Philippines friendship New Year banquet in Manila. The Japanese military attache stationed in Taipei, Takeo Ota, who came to the Philippines to inspect Japanese residents in Davao, Mindanao, specially attended the banquet and gave a speech on Japan-Philippines friendship. Their method of contacting Filipinos can be said to be consistent from the government to the private sector, proceeding vigorously, and their ambition is certainly not small.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, although the political, business, and academic circles organized a Philippine tour group to the Philippines last year, staying for more than a week, the Chinese and Philippine sides had banquets and receptions every night. When they were about to return home, they proposed to political and business celebrities to organize a China-Philippines Association, the purpose of which was to connect China and Philippine feelings and promote commerce between the two sides. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines hoped that it would be quickly realized, and held two or three meetings to decide on the articles of association and sent them to Shanghai, but so far there has been no news of any progress. The so-called China-Philippines Association proposal is probably indefinitely shelved.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Ice Floes Outside Dagukou　Frozen for Over Two Hundred Li <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Shipping in Bohai Bay Completely Suspended　Countless Ships Trapped Outside the Port</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The weather in North China has been unusually cold for nearly half a month. The normal air pressure is constantly below fourteen or fifteen degrees. The water route from Tianjin to outside Dagukou was already heavily frozen from the beginning of last month. The river channel is sealed by ice and snow. Although it slightly bursts during high tide, it still freezes as before after cracking. The Haihe River between Tianjin and Tanggu is about two feet thick with ice. Ling ice accumulates on the black gully side of the sand barrier outside Tanggu to Dagukou, freezing to six or seven feet to one zhang. Small passenger and cargo boats and powerful tugboats of various companies are blocked and cannot travel. From Dagukou to the north along the coast of Bohai Bay for two or three hundred miles, all is frozen solid. The ports of Qinhuangdao are also frozen like a pond. Looking as far as the eye can see, there is no end in sight. It feels as if the world of the Arctic water has been moved before your eyes. Chinese and foreign passenger and cargo ships all suffer when they travel outside Dagukou. For over a week, no ships have entered or exited the port. Powerful ships such as Swire's Shuntian and New Shengjing, Osaka Company's Changan Maru and Changjiang Maru, Dalian Company's Changping Maru and Tianjin Maru, Zhengji Company's Tali and Fuli, and Tongshun Company's Xintai, totaling dozens, are all frozen and stranded inside and outside the port. As of the 7th, a total of seventeen large ships were trapped outside Dagukou, and thirteen large ships were trapped between Dagukou and Tanggu inside Dagukou. Countless sailboats and small steamers were frozen and unable to sail. Ruikang, an agent of Tianjin Shipping Company, was frozen outside Dagukou and urgently telegraphed the Tianjin Customs Port Director for help, hoping to send coal and grain as soon as possible. Zhengji Company's Tongli ship tried to risk sailing from outside the port, but the rudder was broken and could not be turned. Other ships of various companies trapped outside the port were panicked because food and fuel could not be supplied. Small vendors near Dagukou went to sell eggs and bread on the ice because the ships outside the port could not move. Eggs cost one yuan each, and bread costs six or seven yuan per pound. Each vendor makes a profit of three times. The Tianjin Customs Port Authority and the Haihe Engineering Bureau recently sent five icebreakers to try to break the ice outside the port. As a result, three were destroyed and the remaining two froze as they broke the ice. The route was still impassable. On the 6th, Tianjin Shipping Company's new icebreaking tugboat Tianxing arrived at Tanggu after breaking through the ice outside the port, carrying small workers from Tianjin barges. One rudder and wheel of the ship was damaged. The flow of Ling ice at Dagukou Gate is becoming more rapid. Ships without strong horsepower and a sturdy hull will inevitably be pushed onto the ice mountain by the water when passing through. Dalian Company's Yijin Maru was frozen in the ice mountain on Dagukou North Port and has been there for two weeks. I don't know if it has fallen. According to the captain of the Tianxing tugboat, which went outside the port to rescue the Tianjin barge on the 6th, at 10 am today, the ship departed from Tanggu Wharf. Before arriving at Dagukou Wharf, it encountered the Haihe Engineering Bureau's icebreaker Qingling going out of the port at the same time. This ship was in front. By the time it reached Heigou, the Qingling had fallen behind by two li. This ship was about one li away from the Tianjin barge and could not move forward. The ice there was very thick, six or seven feet, and endless, over two hundred li. Seventeen ships were trapped by the water outside the port that could be seen with the naked eye. This ship ultimately failed to rescue the Tianjin ship, etc. Yesterday (the 6th), various shipping merchants in Tianjin held a meeting at Jardine, Matheson &amp; Co. to discuss ways to rescue the ships trapped outside the port. It lasted a long time, but no decision was made. In the end, they had to let nature take its course. Since the ships did not enter the port, the prices of imported goods in Tianjin have risen sharply in recent days. Fresh fruits, etc., mostly come from Japan. Due to the shortage of goods, prices have risen even more severely. The Tianjin Customs Port Director is deeply concerned that various ships will recklessly enter the port regardless of the danger and has issued Notice No. 1, stating that the ice situation in Bohai Bay and outside the Haihe estuary is extremely bad. Local water vessels cannot help. All ships that pass through the bay in the future shall be responsible for any accidents. In addition to being submitted to the Port Affairs Division, this notice is hereby issued to all Chinese and foreign shipping merchants for compliance. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Liu Guitang Bandit Troops Fled to Henan and Were Defeated <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Bandits' Ammunition is Exhausted and They Are Weak, and They Can Be Eliminated Soon</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: After Liu Guitang's bandit troops fled to Henan Province, they raped, looted, and disturbed the people. After being intercepted and attacked by the 32nd Army and the 95th Division, as well as the militia teams of various counties, they all fled to the Shunping area of Hebei. Several hundred of Liu's bandits were severely suppressed by the 95th Division in Jiangjiaji in the southeast of Shexian County. On the 4th, they fled to Paihuai Town in the southwest of Wu'an County, and were intercepted by the Huang Guanghua unit of the 32nd Army. Liu's bandits then fled north to the Hundred Officials River Bottom and other places, and were again intercepted by the Wu'an militia team, killing more than ten bandits, capturing eight alive, and seizing three guns. The remaining bandit troops turned to flee east from the northeast of Wu'an to Furun Village, and continued to flee towards the North Shahetou direction. At present, there are very few bandit troops left. Some fled into the mountains, trying their best to avoid contact with the army. The bandits' ammunition is exhausted and they are weak and not worth attacking. Shang Zhen received a telegram from Huang Guanghua on the 5th, stating that Liu's bandits had taken the opportunity to flee back from the east and west Jiaojing to Paihuai Town via Guzhen, and arrived near Tongle. The division's Zhang regiment and others will use machine guns and mules to form a cavalry of 70 men to search and suppress them with all their strength. It is not difficult to eliminate them. In addition to ordering the division to quickly dispatch teams to transport them by rail to Yulian Town, Linluo Guanxi to suppress and block them, so as to prevent them from fleeing east, Chairman Shang also ordered the militia groups in various counties in northern Henan to conduct a thorough investigation of the scattered bandits, so as to avoid them hiding among the people and making a comeback.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Xiamen　Smuggling is Still Rampant <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Although Customs Destroys Smuggling Ships, It Still Cannot Be Slightly Curbed　Sugar is Almost All Smuggled Goods, and Matches Are Also Affected</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Southern Fujian and Taiwan are only separated by a narrow strip of water, and sailboats can reach it overnight in narrow places. The wind of tax evasion and smuggling is extremely prevalent along the coast. Although the customs has increased anti-smuggling ships and strictly suppressed smuggling, news of cracking down on smuggling is heard every day. In addition to setting up ships to collect smuggled goods, the crew members are also severely punished, but it still cannot be curbed. The wind of smuggling is due to the fact that the seized smuggled goods and smuggling ships are auctioned in Xiamen, and they are usually bought at a low price by the original owners. Therefore, since last autumn, the Xiamen Customs has transported all seized smuggled goods to Shanghai for auction, and the smuggling sailboats are sacrificed by being dismantled and sold as broken wood, and the engines of motorboats are dismantled and transported to Shanghai for auction, and the hulls are also sacrificed by being dismantled. The customs now has a large shipyard on Gulangyu Island, specializing in dismantling these ships, selling the wood to people as fuel. The waste wood is piled up like a mountain, and sometimes it is felt that the money from selling the wood is not enough to cover the demolition wages, so they open fire and sink them. However, although the anti-smuggling is strict, the smugglers are the same as before. From this, it can be seen that the coastal fishing industry is declining and the freight of civil ships is sluggish, causing fishermen and shipworkers to have no work to do, and many of them take risks. On the other hand, it shows that there are many private merchants along the coast, and their role is to directly monopolize the market, making it impossible for legitimate merchants who operate honestly to do anything, and indirectly using the customs to gradually eliminate coastal fishing boats, and to catch them all in one fell swoop. Their plan is truly poisonous and harsh. Ordinary shipworkers do not consider the pros and cons, and sacrifice the entire ship at the cost of one or two hundred yuan. The poverty of the society can be imagined. It is found that sugar is the largest smuggled product in southern Fujian, followed by kerosene and matches. In January, the sugar officially taxed and imported by Xiamen Customs was only 30 packages transported from Taiwan by Shunmei. In January, the customs cracked down on smuggled sugar, totaling 1,070 packages. 1,171 packages were transported to Shanghai for auction. The number of smuggled sugar that can be surveyed at Xiamen alone is 684 packages. As for the inland, the private sugar that is transported from Jiuzhen Founan Bridge in Zhangpu to the counties under Zhangzhou, from Wuyu in Haicang to Shima, from Shenqu in Yongning to Quanzhou, and from Daxiaodeng in Lianhe to Tong'an cannot be counted. As for matches, in Fujian Province, in addition to Japanese matches, the domestic Great China Company also sells a lot. In the past two years, the sales in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou inland reached more than 7,000 boxes per month. For tax-paid imports, each box must be sold for 42 yuan, while Japanese matches, which are smuggled in, only sell for 26 yuan per box, which is a profit of three or four yuan. As a result, domestic products have been severely hit. In the 24th year, the Great China Company's business lost 400,000 yuan. Therefore, if the government does not crack down on smuggling, not only will merchants not be able to support it, but the country's tax revenue will also be affected. Recently, the Ministry of Finance has paid close attention to cracking down on the smuggling of matches. In addition to approving the establishment of branches in Jiuzhen and Fotanju, Zhangpu, where the Fujian Unified Tax Office is located, it also telegraphed the Xiamen Customs to pay attention to anti-smuggling. In the past, the auction prices of the customs' cracked and auctioned goods were often cheaper than those of tax-paid imports, and domestic goods were still hit. Now the auction prices of foreign matches are reviewed and determined by the Unified Tax Office, and they are not sold at reduced prices. This year, domestic matches have begun to improve. Great China has increased from 3,000 boxes sold per month last winter to 4,000 boxes. (February 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e99">Fujian　Survey of the Banking Industry <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>There are a total of twenty-two banks</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: According to a survey by the Statistics Office of the Provincial Government, there are currently twenty-two banks in Fujian Province, which can be divided into three types:　Foreign merchants' banks, there are three in total: Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, located in Fuzhou and Xiamen; Bank of Taiwan, located in Fuzhou and Xiamen; and Banque de l'Indochine, located in Xiamen. In the past, both Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Bank of Taiwan issued notes, but they have now been withdrawn.　Chinese-run banks with headquarters in Shanghai and branches in this province, there are twelve in total: Central Bank of China, located in eight places: Fuzhou, Xiamen, Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Yanping, Pucheng, Jian'ou, and Sandu; Bank of China, located in three places: Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Quanzhou; Bank of Communications, located in two places: Fuzhou and Xiamen; Farmers Bank of China, located in four places: Fuzhou, Xiamen, Pucheng, and Yanping; China Industrial Bank, located in two places: Fuzhou and Xiamen; China Merchants Bank, located in Xiamen; Chung Nan Bank, located in Xiamen; Sin Tai Bank, located in three places: Fuzhou, Yanping, and Pucheng. The above eight banks all issue notes. The National Commercial Bank, located in Xiamen; Overseas Chinese Bank, located in Xiamen; Chung Hing Bank, located in Xiamen; Xinhua Bank, located in Xiamen. The above four banks do not issue notes.　Banks run by Fujianese, there are seven in total: Provincial Bank of Fujian, located in Fuzhou and Xiamen; Hua Nan Bank, Commercial Bank, Hui Nan Bank, Yu Nong Bank, Fu Feng Bank, all located in Fuzhou; Putian Industrial Bank, located in Putian. The above banks, except for the Provincial Bank of Fujian, do not issue notes. In terms of commercial status, the Bank of China and Chung Nan Bank are the most important. In terms of agricultural status, the Farmers Bank of China is the most important. In terms of political status, the Central Bank and the Provincial Bank are the most important. The Central Bank originally concurrently handled the two functions of the national treasury and the provincial treasury. Since the Provincial Bank of Fujian opened in October last year, the provincial treasury has been transferred to the bank to act as an agent. Now the Central Bank is changing its organization to become a reserve bank for national banks, specializing in adjusting finance and stabilizing currency, and does not engage in ordinary commercial bank business. There is no need to set up offices everywhere, so it has been decided to abolish the Yanping, Jian'ou, Pucheng, and four offices under the jurisdiction of the Fuzhou branch, and the Zhangzhou and Quanzhou offices under the jurisdiction of the Xiamen branch. The Provincial Bank of Fujian, on the other hand, is developing its business day by day, and plans to set up offices in Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, Tingzhou, Xianyou, Changle, Fuqing, Fuan, Tong'an, Zhangpu, Chong'an, Putian, Yanping, and Longyan in the near future. The heads of each office have been appointed and ordered to go to prepare immediately. It is found that the bank's capital was originally set at one million yuan, and the provincial government first allocated 500,000 yuan and issued one million yuan of fractional notes. It is now planned to raise another 500,000 yuan and issue another one million yuan of fractional notes to meet the needs. (February 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Lu Province's 108 Counties Divided into Administrative Regions <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing the Experimental Zone Name, Restoring the Commissioner System, Initially Establishing Three Zones: Ji'ning, Heze, and Linyi</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In order to increase administrative efficiency, the provincial government established an administrative region last year in Ji'ning, encompassing fourteen counties. Wang Shaochang was appointed as the administrative inspector commissioner. Later, the name was changed to the County Administration Construction Experimental Zone. Over the past year, significant progress has been made in public training and organization. Therefore, the Provincial Chairman, Han Fuqu, has decided to expand the initiative to the entire province of 108 counties, dividing them into twelve zones. Recently, Heze and Linyi have been added, totaling three zones including the one established last year. Regarding the name, it is proposed to abolish the name "Experimental Zone" and restore the title of Administrative Inspector Commissioner. In addition to Wang Shaochang continuing to serve in Ji'ning, Liang Zhonghua is internally designated for the Heze zone, and Zhang Liyuan for the Linyi zone. Currently, Liang Zhonghua, Liang Shuming, Zhang Liyuan, Sun Zherang, and Wang Shaochang have all been summoned to Jinan to discuss everything. Today (the 6th), Han hosted a banquet at the provincial government for Liang Zhonghua and others, inviting the secretary-general, department heads, and commissioners to attend. During the banquet, there was considerable discussion about the functions and powers of each zone. Han offered many opinions. After the banquet, key figures gathered in the secretary-general's office for detailed talks. A general outline for the organization has already been fully agreed upon. The Administrative Inspector Commissioner will be a senior position, appointed by the provincial government's political affairs meeting and submitted to the Ministry of Interior for forwarding to the Executive Yuan for record. The method remains the promotion of rural agricultural studies and the integration of politics and education, with no major changes from the previous County Administration Construction Experimental Zone. However, there are minor conflicts in functions and powers with various departments, and it is scheduled for Saturday (the 8th) at 8:00 AM for Liang Zhonghua and others to discuss further details with department representatives. If a solution is reached, a final decision can be made, and it may be submitted to the provincial government's political affairs meeting for implementation next week, possibly established around March. As for the regional issues, they are still under study. Chairman Han previously divided the County Administration Construction Experimental Zone into fourteen counties, which was considered too large, and it is proposed to reduce the scope. The Ji'ning zone will be set at ten counties, the Heze zone at nine counties, and the Linyi zone at eight counties, totaling twenty-seven counties. In addition to the original Ji'ning, Wenshang, Dongping, Yuncheng, Yucheng, Heze, Jiaxiang, Juye, Dingtao, Yutai, Jinxiang, Shanxian, Chengwu, and Caoxian, thirteen new counties will be added. The names of the counties have not yet been announced, but the authorities have previously indicated that Linyi, Tancheng, Yishui, Feixian, Mengyin, Rizhao, Juxian, Zou, Teng, and Yi counties, etc., would be included. Calculating, there are already twenty-four counties, leaving only three more needed. The larger Qufu, Ningyang, Ziyang, and Sishui counties may be included.</p>

<p>The government is strictly banning opium smoking with a four-year plan for complete eradication, showing strong determination. At the beginning of the general registration of opium smokers, many were hesitant and evasive, resulting in many omissions. According to the law, those who smoke privately without a license will be punished. Considering carefulness and leniency, the government has specially organized self-renewal registration as a way for unlicensed opium smokers to self-reflect and awaken. The provincial department specially appointed Inspector Ren Yingcang to Songjiang to supervise. Under County Magistrate Li's leadership, starting from the first of this month, they have been dispatching daily to each district to urge the district, township, and baojia heads to screen and investigate. Simultaneously, armed police are being led to screen and investigate door-to-door. As of yesterday, over four thousand people have been registered, with over three thousand having obtained licenses. However, district and township chiefs are still screening and investigating, with possibly over a thousand still remaining. Now that the self-renewal registration deadline is approaching, the county magistrate has specially called a meeting of the township chiefs of the first district at 1:00 PM on the ninth to urge them to expedite and ensure no omissions. It is reported that County Magistrate Li will still need to go to each district to supervise starting from the thirteenth.</p>

The remaining over 800 yuan will be allocated after the dissolution.</p>

<p>Five robbers, including Lu Aweng, detained in Wujiang County Prison, were banned from gambling by Warden Cheng Gou. Dissatisfied, they instigated over 140 inmates to go on a hunger strike starting at 3:00 PM on the eighth to intimidate. Warden Cheng, upon hearing the news, immediately tried to persuade them himself, but to no avail. He immediately reported to County Magistrate Xu for instructions. County Magistrate Xu immediately dispatched a security brigade for defense to prevent any accidents. At the same time, he personally went to persuade them, explaining the advantages and disadvantages, and brought out Lu Aweng and others, shackling them and transferring them to another prison. By about 6:00 PM, the turmoil subsided. On the ninth, the details of the incident were reported to Chief Judge Zhu of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Yangzhou: Salt Transport Deputy's Instruction to Maintain Embankment Works <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Over a hundred workers, including boat laborers and salt shore employees from Twelve Embankments and Eighteen Gangs, came to Yangzhou to petition various party and government agencies and the Huainan Salt Transport Deputy, expressing their wish to address the critical situation. The representatives, including Yang Yusheng, petitioned the Salt Transport Deputy's Office, stating the urgency of the situation and requesting the immediate allocation of transport to alleviate the suffering. The following instruction was received: "The petition is noted. According to the representatives' presentation to this office, temporarily considering the extenuating circumstances, the four-shore office of this office will convene relevant shore transporters as soon as possible within a feasible range to provide maintenance and relief. The representatives must maintain order and not make excessive demands, which may disrupt local security and violate the law. It should be known that the allocation of transport is the responsibility of the Lianghuai Salt Transport Envoy, who has a unified adjustment plan. Transporters cannot make arrangements at will, nor can they solely consider the needs of the boat laborers. If there are necessary petition matters, they can only be submitted in writing to the transport envoy for review and compliance. Repeatedly gathering crowds to negotiate with transporters is akin to causing disturbances and is undesirable. In addition to informing the office, you should be informed accordingly."</p>

<h3 id="e110">The Occurrence and Prevention of Diseases (Part 2) <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Baoshan, Technical Official of the Ministry of Health</p>
<p>Dear listeners, today I will continue to talk about the "Occurrence and Prevention of Diseases" that I didn't finish last time. Regarding this topic, remember that last time we finished talking about the occurrence of diseases. Now we will talk about how to prevent diseases before they occur, as well as prevention methods.</p>
<p>I have already said above that now, because of the evolution of society, there are more and more opportunities for human health to be robbed. Therefore, in order to maintain our lives and protect our health, we should try our best to adapt to this new environment. Medical facilities are one way to help mankind adapt to the new environment. Medicine has gradually progressed from an extremely naive and obscure level to today's scientific medicine, and the effectiveness of disease elimination has also gradually increased. In the past, patients with syphilis could only let it rot naturally for ten or eight years. Now there are special medicines that can be injected. As long as it is treated early, the root of the disease can be removed. In the past, there were many diseases that could not be cured. Once you got sick, you had to prepare a coffin and wait to die. Now there are medicines that can be cured. This is the benefit that modern scientific medicine gives to society and mankind. However, we are still not satisfied with this method of disease removal, because seeking medical treatment when sick is the second and last resort. Let's not talk about the trouble of medicine and the suffering of surgery, and the economic losses during the illness period. Even if there are diseases that can be cured, there are still considerable risks, because many diseases, although treated by doctors, still depend on their natural good course. If the course is poor, even if the doctor exhausts his wisdom, it is difficult to save him. Therefore, it is better to repair the house before it rains than to dig a well when you are thirsty. Paying attention to prevention in advance. In fact, most diseases can be prevented. The Western proverb "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" has become the golden rule of the medical community. This proactive disease elimination method is the most important part of modern acoustics: "Preventive Medicine". The purpose of preventive medicine is to eliminate various internal causes of disease, thereby improving the health of the people, preventing external causes from acting on the body or invading the body and causing effects, so as to prevent the occurrence of diseases. Its ultimate goal is to enable all mankind to enjoy the richest life and give society the greatest contribution - to obtain real health.</p>
<p>The fundamental way to prevent disease is for everyone to have a healthy life and a hygienic environment: strive to promote personal health, and at the same time accept the special disease prevention methods given to us by science - that is, "vaccination". However, we must know that people are not isolated in society. One person gets sick, and it can affect the second person. If the environment in society is unhygienic, the personal environment will naturally suffer. Therefore, we must go further. This is to work hard to assist in the construction of public health services. Now I will briefly describe these aspects below.</p>
<p>Personal healthy life Personal healthy life includes both physical and psychological aspects. To obtain this kind of healthy life, the first step is to have the knowledge to maintain physical health - that is, common medical and health knowledge. The second step is to use this knowledge to develop correct ideals and attitudes, and earnestly transform our whole life into hygiene. The most important points in personal healthy life are as follows: First, pay attention to nutrition, because the structure of the human body and the work of various functions all originate from food. Therefore, when choosing food, you should distribute it properly so that it can supply various needs of the body. The same is true for the quality of food as for the quantity. Second, pay attention to rest. Our daily work causes fatigue in various parts of the body, so there must be appropriate rest to maintain the health of the body. Sleep is the best way to rest. People with insomnia, because the body only consumes and does not compensate, gradually become thin, health deteriorates, and diseases are prone to occur. On average, each person should sleep at least eight hours a day. Third, pay attention to cleanliness, because uncleanliness is the biggest obstacle to health; unclean food not only hinders digestion, but also has the possibility of causing gastrointestinal diseases; unclean teeth are prone to tooth decay and can also cause other serious diseases such as nephritis; unclean skin directly induces various skin diseases and indirectly affects the body's metabolism - that is, physiological functions. Fourth, pay attention to normal excretion. Waste products produced by the human body due to various physiological functions, as well as the remaining residue after food is digested, must be excreted from the body in order to maintain the health of the body. The excretion of these wastes takes place through the lungs, skin, large intestine, and kidneys. In order to promote the excretion of the lungs, the indoor air should be constantly circulated, and you should often go outdoors to enjoy the benefits of fresh air; for the skin, you should bathe often and pay attention to cleanliness; to promote the excretion of the large intestine, you should have a bowel movement at a fixed time every day, so that it can become a habit. Eating more fruits and vegetables is also very beneficial; as for promoting kidney excretion, the most important thing is to drink more boiled water, at least six large glasses a day. The key is to exercise, because appropriate and moderate exercise can promote blood circulation, so that the water and heat of endocrine can be evenly distributed throughout the body, and at the same time, it can increase the body's excretion and promote the body's nutrition. Sixth, pay attention to cultivating a fulfilling spiritual life, which means training individuals to be able to cope with various environmental situations and various problems in life with ease. To achieve this goal, you must cultivate personal self-reliance, self-esteem, and a broad mind that is not selfish. In your spare time, you should also pay attention to engaging in legitimate entertainment. The "diabetes" we talked about the day before yesterday is a disease of abnormal "metabolism". The main reason is that there is not enough "islet purple" produced by the pancreas. People with diabetes, if they are careful in their diet and eat less starchy and sugary foods, and at the same time keep their entire life in a normal state and not contrary to health principles, can at least reduce the disease. As for the external causes of disease, such as the "lung disease" example I gave the day before yesterday, we know that bacteria are difficult to attack people who pay attention to hygiene and have a healthy constitution. Moreover, tuberculosis bacteria come from the sputum of people with tuberculosis or the excretions of the affected area. If we do not spit everywhere, and cover our mouths and noses with a handkerchief when talking, laughing, coughing, or sneezing, separate the patient's utensils, and place the patient's sputum and the excretions of the affected area in a fixed place and disinfect them at any time, this is simply cutting off the entry and exit of tuberculosis bacteria completely. Since the route of infection is cut off, the disease will naturally not be transmitted. If we can take a step further and send all people who have this disease and are contagious to hospitals or sanatoriums for isolation, it will be even safer.</p>
<p>Vaccination Vaccination, commonly known as vaccination, is a special disease prevention method that science has given us and is very reliable. As we said the day before yesterday, the human body has a kind of immunity that can resist infectious diseases. This immunity can be natural or acquired. Modern medicine has been able to use artificial methods to make human tissues develop acquired immunity to resist certain infectious diseases. This artificial method is to inject a small amount of dead bacteria or viruses into the human body, which is enough to stimulate human tissues to produce immunity but not enough to cause disease. It has now been proven that there are valuable vaccinations, such as vaccination against smallpox, injection of diphtheria toxoid to prevent diphtheria, injection of typhoid cholera vaccine to prevent typhoid and cholera, injection of Pasteur vaccine to increase resistance to plague, and so on. We people living in this dangerous environment should try our best to accept this scientific method and not neglect it in the slightest.</p>
<p>Environmental hygiene Paying attention to environmental hygiene is the best way to eliminate the transmission route of bacteria. Many diseases are transmitted due to unsanitary environments. For example, enteric infectious diseases - such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery - are caused by feces containing these bacteria contaminating water sources, or by flies or other carriers of bacteria transmitting the bacteria in the feces to food, leading to infectious spread. Therefore, if we can pay attention to improving the water supply equipment, protecting the cleanliness of the water source, installing screens on the doors and windows of kitchens and dining rooms, installing fly-proof equipment, disinfecting feces before discarding them, or installing sewers, and then introducing all the feces into a public breeding site and disinfecting them, this will not only prevent flies from breeding, but also prevent the water source and food from being contaminated by bacteria, and the disease will not be transmitted. As for the houses where individuals live, the environment around the houses, and all public entertainment venues, etc., if they can strictly comply with hygienic rules, they will be of great benefit to health and disease prevention, especially for respiratory infectious diseases, such as colds, flu, pneumonia, etc., it is more effective. Eliminating stagnant pools of water, ditches, and removing weeds to prevent mosquitoes from breeding can prevent malaria, relapsing fever, elephantiasis, etc., because these diseases are transmitted by mosquitoes. Therefore, environmental hygiene occupies an important position in disease prevention.</p>
<p>In summary, the various facilities and methods to prevent the occurrence of diseases are nothing more than first making the general public understand the causes of diseases, starting with a healthy personal life, and then proceeding to accept various vaccinations and improve environmental hygiene. All of these are very important. However, individual ability is limited, and we need the ability of the entire society to cooperate, so that we can achieve easy success. Therefore, after 1848, all advanced countries and societies seeking human happiness have an organization called public health. So now I will briefly introduce this public health organization as an ending: Public health is a social organization used to prevent disease, prolong life, and promote human health. This organization seeks environmental hygiene, prevents infectious diseases, instills personal hygiene knowledge, and organizes public medical and health institutions in order to achieve early diagnosis and prevention of various diseases, and to enable individuals to have suitable living conditions to maintain health. Simply put, public health is a social organization for preventing disease and seeking happiness for mankind. Its scope is very broad, including medical management, medical relief, suppression and prevention of various infectious diseases, industrial hygiene, school hygiene, maternal and child hygiene, environmental hygiene, hygienic experiments, vital statistics, implementation of health education, research on public health undertakings, training of health workers, etc. The above-mentioned facilities can directly reduce the mortality rate of the population and the disease rate in society, and indirectly increase social productivity and enrich the social economy. I only need to cite a few more obvious examples to prove that public health can indeed seek happiness for society and mankind.</p>
<p>Increased life expectancy - In the sixteenth century, the average life expectancy in European countries was only about 21 years old, but now several countries - such as Australia and New Zealand - have increased the average life expectancy to 60 years old. A large part of this has been added in the last fifty years following the progress of scientific medicine. The average life expectancy in our country, where scientific medicine has not yet developed, is still around 30 years old, which clearly shows the relationship between medical development and life expectancy.</p>
<p>The success of the Panama Canal - This is an example of overcoming disease with human power. When the French started digging the Panama Canal, because malaria was rampant, 1,500 out of every 100,000 workers died from the disease. Because the losses in terms of both human lives and economy were too great, they had to stop work. Later, the method of malaria transmission was invented, and the United States implemented various methods of preventing malaria and continued to dig the Panama Canal. As a result, the great project was a success.</p>
<p>Typhoid - In European and American countries 30 years ago, every year 30 several people out of 100,000 died by this illness. But after the finding this illness's spreading material is water and flies, they improve environment sanitation by force. The most important things are to settle faeces, improve water supply, and wipe off flies. In today, only 3 Americans die by this illness in every 100,000, just one British. But this illness still prevails in China, and nearly at least 30 people die by this illness. Can this show public health can reduce illness is a good example?</p>
<p>Plague - Plague will prevail in Fujian, Guangdong, and countries in Europe. In 14 century, one-quarter of people in Europe (near 2.5 million) die with this illness. Today the plague near doesn't exist in all the countries of Europe after using many kinds of preventive method. But a large pandemic happened in Fujian and Xinjiang in our country this year, and this can verify the value of preventive medicine.</p>
<p>The four examples above clearly tell us: To eliminate diseases and seek happiness for society and mankind, we should try our best to engage in various public health facilities. Now our government has the determination to promote health undertakings and is gradually developing them. However, we still hope that the whole country will work together to study and promote them, so that they can be widely promoted throughout the country. In this way, not only can diseases be eradicated, but also the status of the nation can rise steadily and be on par with the world's great powers. (End)</p>

The former General Manager Liu Hongsheng has decided to go to the company to handle the handover. The Ministry of Communications has specially appointed Chief Accountant Lu Rongguang of the Ministry to supervise the inventory. The Shanghai Chinese and foreign press have expressed their welcome. The New New Press reporter has translated the following comments from the Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury and the China Press: The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury stated that Cai Zengji, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau and Director of the Land Bureau, and Tan Boying, Manager of the Shanghai Trust and Savings Society, are scheduled to take over the most important shipping agency in China, the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, on Monday. The appointment of Cai and Tan as General Manager and Deputy Manager of the company is warmly welcomed by the Chinese and foreign business and shipping circles. It is believed that under their leadership, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which has been around for decades, will see a new look, and its development can be expected. The China Press stated that Cai has a high reputation in Chinese and foreign business circles and has long been trusted by Chinese and foreigners. He served as Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau for several years. (During the city's extremely difficult financial situation, the city's revenue and expenditure were balanced, largely due to Cai's efforts. Since the January 28th Incident, the city's revenue has decreased, while the post-war reconstruction and the construction of the city center require a lot of money. However, Cai planned and responded to each project, and each project was carried out one after another. A few months ago, he also served as Director of the Municipal Land Bureau. Since taking office, he has spared no effort to rectify the bureau's affairs, eliminate all previous bad habits, and publish and adopt many new measures. The atmosphere has been completely renewed. His decision to head the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will undoubtedly make a contribution to the company's policies.</p>
<p>Ministry of Communications Commends General Manager Liu: The Ministry of Communications issued instructions, stating that since General Manager Liu has been in charge of the company's affairs for three years, he has achieved outstanding performance. The Ministry originally intended to rely on his talents to jointly develop the state-run shipping industry, but as he has repeatedly insisted on resigning, it is inconvenient to refuse his request. His resignation is hereby approved, and the matter has been reported to the Executive Yuan. He is hereby ordered to be informed.</p>

<p>According to New New Press, the Ministry of Finance previously believed that the trading prices of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange had fallen sharply, and immediately sent personnel to investigate thoroughly, and ordered the exchange to temporarily suspend trading.

Therefore, this case has come to an end.</p>
<p>Waiting Quietly for Ministerial Orders: The Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange has been temporarily suspended since the third of the month upon instruction from the Ministry of Finance, and it has been a week until yesterday. Now that the investigation by the Ministry of Finance has come to an end, the Unified and Reconstruction Bond Regulations will be officially promulgated by the National Government, and after the Ministry of Finance's instructions arrive in Shanghai, trading can resume as usual. The chairman of the exchange, Zhang Weiru, and the staff of each section have been going to the exchange as usual to work, waiting quietly for the Ministry's orders to open the market. As for the brokerage firms, in addition to submitting guarantees and customer names and true name and address forms to the Ministry for verification, the rest are continuing to fill them out in preparation for resuming business as usual after the market opens.</p>

After being assigned to the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company for printing, they are now rushing to print them, aiming to complete the printing completely before the end of March. At that time, the Ministry of Finance will announce the start of the recall.

<p>Trial Report Satisfactory After Three Months</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Press, the Shanghai Telegram Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in order to facilitate users, specially launched a telephone telegraph service on a trial basis from November 16th of last year. For all business hours after 6:00 PM every day until 7:00 AM the next morning, and after 12:00 PM on Saturday, telegraphs can be sent. The telephone telegraph service is open all day on holidays. When sending a telegram, users can dial the telephone number 13082. After receiving a reply from the telegraph bureau, they must report their telephone number and account name clearly, hang up the phone, and wait for the telegraph bureau staff to notify them to send the telegram. After the user has finished transmitting the telegram, the telegraph bureau staff will repeat it once for confirmation. If the proofreading is correct, the recorded telegram will be handed over to the machine for transmission, and a copy will be prepared, indicating the amount of telegraphic charges to be collected, and a receipt will be issued, which will be delivered by the telegraph messenger to the original sender's address the next morning for personal review, signature, and stamping, and the telegraphic charges will be collected. Telegraphic account users of the telegraph bureau who use their residential telephone to send telegrams after business hours and include the telegraphic charges in the bill for monthly settlement must apply to the telegraph bureau in advance and start transmitting telegrams only after approval. Since the start of the trial reporting, users have felt very convenient, and for more than two months, telegram senders have been extremely enthusiastic. The bureau originally set the trial reporting period for three months. If the trial results are excellent, it will officially start reporting. According to reporters from the bureau yesterday, since the trial report started on November 16th, it has been three months as of the 16th of this month, and the trial results are very satisfactory. Therefore, the bureau will officially implement the telephone telegraph service starting on the 16th of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Qingdao Industrial Observation Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Starting Today to Visit Factories <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Intended to Visit Five Areas Divide into Groups to Conduct - According to Talks, Impressions Obtained in Beijing and Wuxi Were Excellent</p>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Social Bureau and the industrial safety and hygiene observation group organized by the industrial sector went to Beijing at the beginning of this month to visit the Central Factory Inspection Office and the industrial safety and hygiene exhibition jointly organized by the Ministry of Industry, and went to Wuxi to visit various factories. After completing their work, the entire group arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 PM the night before last. A New New Press reporter specially interviewed group member Chen Keyao yesterday morning. According to reports, the group's impressions and feelings obtained in Beijing and Wuxi were very detailed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Purpose of the Qingdao Industrial Group Organization: According to Mr. Chen, in the infancy of industry in China, all factories are only slightly rudimentary. If one wants to find a factory with comprehensive safety and hygiene equipment, there are not many to see. However, this equipment is extremely important to the factory itself and the welfare of the workers. The Central Factory Inspection Office, in view of this, specially launched an industrial safety and hygiene exhibition in Beijing to promote the attention of factories across the country. In order to seek sound factory organization, the Qingdao Municipal Social Bureau and industrialists originally had an industrial safety and hygiene association. This decision was made to improve facilities and specially organized an observation group to visit Beijing, and went to the most industrially developed areas in the country, Shanghai and Wuxi, to investigate the actual facilities of the factories, so as to learn from them.</p>
<p>Visiting the Industrial Safety Exhibition: After the members of the group arrived in Beijing to visit the exhibition, they gained excellent impressions. Most people's ideal is that without huge amounts of money, it is difficult to expect comprehensive safety and hygiene equipment. What we saw in Beijing are all easy and inexpensive, and can make the factory safe and worry-free. Each factory can imitate and carry out. Not only can many unfortunate accidents be reduced, but also the welfare of workers is not shallow. However, the exhibition is only held in Beijing, which is quite insufficient. After the factory has the above-mentioned equipment, the workers must also understand and cooperate in order to achieve perfection. Although it is not impossible for workers from various places to go to Beijing to visit, the number is limited. Most of them have not seen this actual phenomenon, which is difficult to popularize. Therefore, when we were in Beijing, we suggested to Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry to hold the exhibition in various important industrial areas in order to achieve universality and achieve practical results. Minister Wu has already nodded in agreement and is planning to proceed. Once it can be put into practice, the national industry will definitely benefit a lot.</p>
<p>Impressions Gained from Various Factories in Beijing and Wuxi: In addition to visiting the exhibition in Beijing, the group went to various factories to conduct on-site inspections. They felt that the factories had considerable safety and hygiene equipment. It is agreed that the Jiangnan Automobile Company has the most comprehensive equipment and personnel management, which is highly commendable. After completing the work in Beijing, the group took a car to Wuxi on the 5th. After inspecting various factories in Wuxi, they had excellent impressions of the Huatong Silk Factory, the Shenxin Third Yarn Factory, and the Tongyi Machine Factory. It is agreed that Shenxin's labor autonomy has been particularly effective.</p>
<p>Visiting Shanghai Factories Today: When reporters asked about the itinerary in Shanghai, the answer was that today (i.e., yesterday) happened to be a regular Sunday holiday, and the colleagues were temporarily resting due to the fatigue of traveling. It was decided that tomorrow (starting today, we will contact various places to visit. The purpose of the visit is divided into five items, namely: A. Safety matters, building style of the factory, Taipingmen fire equipment training, the structure of boilers, the installation and protection of the engine, the installation and management of electrical money switch, the installation of power transmission, the protection of working machinery gears, B. Hygiene matters, about the factory's lighting ventilation temperature and humidity adjustment, about the processing and storage of toxic materials, about the absorption and cleaning of dust and powder, about the canteen, drinks, dormitory, toilet, medicine, and first aid, about epidemic prevention, vaccination, physical examination, and other hygiene, C. Worker welfare matters, worker working hours, rest holidays, and worker education, the treatment of female workers before and after childbirth, the work of female workers, child workers, and apprentices, worker savings insurance and cooperative entertainment, worker bonus distribution and worker injury, illness, and death allowances, about female workers' breastfeeding rooms, nurseries, and other welfare, D. Personnel management matters, the recruitment or employment of workers and apprentices, the contract regulations of workers and apprentices, the examination and rewards and punishments of workers, the job changes and layoffs of workers, the records of workers and apprentices, the training management of workers and worker organizations, E. General matters, about the history of the factory, and the current operating conditions, various organizations, manufacturing and production and sales, taxation, insurance, others, after the group completes the observation in Shanghai, they will gather the materials obtained from the visit, hold a meeting to discuss, and then decide what to do.</p>

<h3 id="e125">The Special District Telephone Price Increase is Near - Citywide Users are Resolutely Fighting - The Telephone Committee Sends Letters Requesting Separate Meetings - Vowing to Persist Until a Satisfactory Resolution is Achieved <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: The Special District Telephone Issue Committee of this city, considering that the implementation period for the Special District telephone price increase is approaching, has sent letters to both Chinese and foreign taxpayer associations, requesting that a taxpayer meeting be convened to discuss fundamental cancellation methods. However, no news has been received as of yet. In preparation for the final struggle, the committee has scheduled an executive committee meeting for the 12th of this month to discuss countermeasures. In addition, the committee has sent a letter to the Citizens' Federation, requesting that it instruct its district branches to convene joint meetings of telephone users separately, to adopt the same steps to facilitate progress. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Willing to Sacrifice if a Resolution is Not Achieved</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee sent a letter to the First Special District and Second Special District Citizens' Federations the other day, stating: Respectfully, the Shanghai Telephone Company is effectively increasing prices in disguise, and the collection of fees is imminent. However, as it concerns the economic interests of citizens and affects the entire business community, all citizens are rising up in opposition. It is understood that telephones are a public utility intended to facilitate society. Therefore, the remuneration obtained from business operations cannot be equated with profit-generating commerce. The company uses the agreement with the Municipal Council to charge an official interest rate of one percent as an excuse to arbitrarily increase prices, disregarding the interests of the public, which is a grave mistake. Shanghai's commerce, since January 28th, has declined to its lowest point. The expensive houses in the concessions of the past are now unwanted. Although the number of telephone users has not decreased, it is due to business relationships and they dare not dismantle them easily. The company is acting monopolistically and selfishly, oppressing the citizens, which is not permissible in terms of reason and emotion. In addition to scheduling an executive committee meeting to discuss the final countermeasures, this committee is writing to your association to inform all citizens that, until a satisfactory resolution is achieved, they are willing to sacrifice everything and persist to achieve the final goal. Furthermore, we request that you promptly notify the district branches to convene users throughout the district to discuss resistance measures, in order to take the same steps. Time is of the essence. We hope you will investigate and act accordingly. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Sending Letters to Various Organizations to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee sent letters to various trade associations in this city yesterday, stating: Respectfully, the Shanghai Telephone Company, in order to satisfy its desire for an annual interest rate of one percent, has formulated new fee regulations that will be implemented starting March 1st. In this autumn of economic downturn and industrial and commercial stagnation, how can we bear further burdens? All of our trade organizations should consider the situation from the perspective of their members and users, and work together to resist. Your association is a group of merchants in a certain industry and should actively seek benefits for all members to gradually reduce the economic panic so that recovery can be hoped for and restoration can be expected. Moreover, telephones are a tool to improve commercial communication, and once restricted by per-call fees, they will be an invisible constraint, and the intangible losses to the industry will be incalculable. This committee witnesses this with heartache and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are sending this letter to solicit your opinions, so that we can gather wisdom and unite to make the most resolute expression and forceful resistance. (Guowen News Agency)</p>
<p>Telephone Committee Discussing Countermeasures Again</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Issue Committee, considering that the telephone price increase is approaching, has scheduled the third board of directors meeting for 3:00 PM on the 12th of this month at the City Merchant Association in Tianhougong Bridge to prepare countermeasures, and has invited all advisory committee members to attend to discuss the matter together. A Dagong News Agency reporter met with committee member Mr. Yu Yaoqiu yesterday, who stated that all sectors are paying close attention to the telephone price increase issue. However, the committee's responsibilities are heavy and difficult to handle. In addition to sending letters to various legal entities requesting that they uphold justice, the committee will convene a joint meeting of representatives from various organizations to solicit public opinion, as the committee is formed by various organizations, and its advocacy must comply with the public opinion of those organizations. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>District Branches Preparing for Resistance</p>
<p>The forty-one district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to oppose the telephone price increase issue, jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers Association the other day, requesting that a taxpayer meeting be convened to discuss the overall solution. They also received instructions from the Special District Telephone Issue Committee to convene telephone users in each district to discuss countermeasures. Branches in the Second, Fifth, Seventh, Thirtieth, and Twelfth Districts, among others, have scheduled meetings for this afternoon (Monday) at their respective branch locations to gather telephone users separately and prepare for the final resistance. Other district branches and citizen branches in the French Concession will also hold meetings starting tomorrow to take the same steps. (Dagong News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e130">Jiangsu Province Actively Improving Sericulture <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Ordering High-Quality Silkworm Eggs for Distribution to Farmers for Breeding - Ordering 850,000 Mulberry Saplings and Instructing Various Counties to Plant Them</p>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee believes that farmers have been following outdated practices in silkworm rearing for years, resulting in low cocoon prices and economic hardship for farmers. Therefore, it has established a sericulture experiment station and sent personnel to Japan to order spring silkworm eggs for sale to farmers. It has borrowed 160,000 yuan from the Jiangsu Bank and other sources for distribution to farmers, enabling them to obtain high-quality eggs and improve rearing methods. This is now actively underway. The committee believes that most of the mulberry trees planted by farmers in various places were planted more than a decade ago, resulting in dry and old mulberry leaves, which has an impact on the future of silkworm rearing. The reason for this is the collapse of the rural economy and the drastic drop in cocoon prices, leaving farmers unable to afford to purchase mulberry saplings and plant new mulberry trees. If improvements are not sought, the sericulture industry will be completely bankrupt. Therefore, it has purchased 800,000 high-quality mulberry saplings from Zhejiang Province and received 50,000 improved mulberry saplings from the National Economic Commission for distribution to farmers in various counties for planting. The committee will also send personnel to guide planting methods, ensuring improvement. Once successful results are achieved, it plans to completely replant all old mulberry trees, gradually bringing the sericulture industry in our country onto a bright path.</p>

<h3 id="e137">The Special Second Court Tried the Case of Guo Yuzhou's False Accusation <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Closing Arguments Concluded - Sentencing on the 14th</p>
<p>Guo Yuzhou, a Cantonese businessman from Chaozhou who was twice kidnapped for ransom, is 57 years old this year and resides at No. 1 Yuyang Lane, Berville Road, in the French Concession, which is his own property. He previously opened the Xiafei Apartment at the entrance of Yuyang Lane and hired Zhong Xin, a local, as manager. Last winter, Guo discovered that Zhong had embezzled 500 yuan and reported Zhong to the French police station for embezzlement. The police department filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court. After the trial, the defendant Zhong Xin was found not guilty. The police department, dissatisfied with the verdict, appealed to the Third High Court. After deliberation, the collegial panel dismissed the appeal. During the Third High Court's trial, the complainant Guo Yuzhou repeatedly failed to appear in court. The prosecutor considered that the original complainant Guo Yuzhou was indeed suspected of making a false accusation and transferred the case to the Special Second Court Procuratorate for investigation and prosecution to deter frivolous lawsuits. After the prosecutor Wang Ren of the Special Second Court summoned the defendant Guo Yuzhou to court for investigation, he determined that Guo's false accusation was true and ordered Guo to pay 300 yuan in cash bail to be released pending further investigation. He then filed a public prosecution with the criminal court of the same level for the crime of false accusation under Article 169, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The trial was held the other day in the Second Criminal Court by Judge Xiong Hui Ping together with Prosecutor Wang. First, the prosecutor stated the intent of the prosecution. The defendant Guo Yuzhou appeared with his defense lawyer. Guo stated that Zhong Xin had been working as a merchant for seven or eight years, and he had always trusted him. On August 29th of last year, he gave him money to purchase goods. Unexpectedly, on September 3rd, Zhong suddenly announced his separation from the merchant, and the accounts were not handed over. After checking, he discovered that Zhong had embezzled more than 500 yuan, so he reported it to the police station and did not make a false accusation. His lawyer then made a defense. The court declared the closing arguments concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 14th. The defendant was ordered to remain on the original bail.</p>

<p>Three Defendants Arrested Successively - Li Xushi Recounts the Incident</p>
<p>Li Xushi, a 39-year-old woman from Yangzhou living at No. 4 Rongshen Lane, Menggu Road, Zhabei, previously reported to the French police station that her husband, Li Yuanshou, was arrested and sent to the Nanshi District Court on May 13th of last year for a murder case. On June 7th, two fellow villagers, Zhang Guangxi (27 years old, employee of the Samsung Barber Shop at No. 491 Kangti Road) and Luo Laosan (39 years old, employee of the Dong'an Barber Shop at No. 656 Xipushi Road), together with Liu Changgui, a fellow villager living at No. 36 Ning'an Lane, Haining Road, came to her house. Zhang and Luo claimed that Liu was a bailiff of the court and held a court warrant to arrest her for questioning. She was shocked and pleaded with them. Zhang and Luo then claimed that they could settle the case if she paid 420 yuan. She agreed and scraped together 200 yuan and wrote an IOU for 220 yuan. On July 27th, she borrowed 100 yuan from Wang Xiaolaizi at the South Wharf and gave it to Zhang and Luo. On August 3rd, she borrowed another 120 yuan from Zhou Wenliang on Sanma Road and gave it to Zhang, Luo, and Liu. However, they did not return the IOU after receiving the money. Recently, she went to the Nanshi District Court to find Liu Changgui and ask for the IOU back. People in the court replied that there was no one named Liu Changgui in the court serving as a bailiff. She then realized that Zhang, Luo, and Liu had colluded to defraud her of money and requested their arrest for investigation. The detective approved her request and sent investigators to arrest the two defendants Zhang and Luo and escort them to the Special Second Court for detention. Liu fled upon hearing the news. The court issued a warrant for his arrest. Recently, investigator Zhou Qingfang arrested Liu and escorted him to the court, where he was joined to the case. The case was continued in the Eighth Criminal Court the other day by Judge Sun Pengxian of the Special Third Court. The complainant Li Xushi recounted the defendants' fraud. The three defendants Zhang, Luo, and Liu confessed that they had committed the fraud. They also claimed that the plaintiff lived by working as a domestic helper. How could she have such a large sum of money to be defrauded? They requested an investigation. The court verified the statements and, as the case required further detailed investigation, ordered that they be detained pending investigation and rescheduled the hearing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>All Related Parties Were Prosecuted</p>
<p>Shen Er Nian, a woman from Jiaxing who is now 18 years old, was sold to Xu Abao, a woman from Suzhou who operated a brothel at No. 17 Yingchun Lane, Hubei Road, for 250 yuan in August of last year at the Shenjiang Hotel on Hankou Road to work as a prostitute. From then on, Shen fell into a fiery pit, suffering endless trampling and misery. Sometimes, because she could not receive patrons, she was whipped by Xu, no different from a living hell. Recently, Shen, unable to bear the suffering, took advantage of Xu's negligence and secretly escaped the other day, seeking relief at the Old City Gate police station. Western detective Fang Tai'er and Chinese detective Chen Shanji went and first arrested Xu Abao. Then, they went to No. 23 Hongfu Lane, Xinzha Road, and arrested the original introducer, Ni Guicai from Jiangbei, and brought them back to the police station. Yesterday, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Police attorney Wang Yaotang stated the details and filed a prosecution under Article 241 of the Criminal Law. Then, Shen Er Nian submitted a petition describing her being sold and abused. Judge Qian Hongye questioned the two defendants and ordered them to be detained, pending rescheduling of the hearing.</p>

<p>Around 6 PM the day before yesterday, four burglars speaking the local dialect and wearing blue short jackets suddenly broke into Yixing Rice Store at 20 Ouyang Road, Zhabei (owned by Mao Guangcai). Two of the burglars took out pistols to intimidate the staff and prevent them from making noise, while the other two ransacked the place, eventually stealing 20 National Currency dollars, 114 double dimes, and a tin briefcase. After the robbery, the four burglars fled with their loot, running towards Qimei Road. The store owner reported the robbery to Niu Jingjian, the chief of the Linping Road Police Station, requesting that the criminals and stolen goods be investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Major Drug Trafficking Suspect Qin Cainan Ordered to Find Bail <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Former Guarantor Requests Withdrawal</p>
<p>Qin Cainan, a Wuxi native involved in an international drug trafficking case, was arrested by the French police in the summer of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933] and brought before the Special District Court, which sentenced him to imprisonment and a fine. During the appeal period, he was released on bail with a 5,000 yuan cash deposit and a 10,000 yuan joint guarantee from three businesses. After being released on bail, Qin appealed the verdict to the Higher Third Branch Court, but the appeal was rejected. His father then appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned the original verdict and sent the case back to the Higher Third Branch Court for retrial. As previously reported, the Higher Third Branch Court has issued documents to various relevant government offices to assist in the investigation. However, during the appeal period, two of the original three guarantor businesses closed due to the poor economy. The remaining guarantor, Pan Chicheng, the owner of a cosmetics factory, requested to withdraw his guarantee due to the large sum involved. Qin claimed illness and did not appear in court. As a result, Hong Xiangtao, the owner of Yushun Rice Store on Rue Garafilo, and a coal store jointly guaranteed 5,000 yuan and Qin paid a 5,000 yuan cash deposit. Pan Chicheng, the original guarantor who withdrew, alleged that Qin's family had made extortion attempts, leading to a lawsuit in the Special District Court's criminal division for defamation. Recently, the new guarantors, Hong Xiangtao and others, heard rumors that Qin was liquidating his assets and leaving Shanghai. They filed a petition with the Higher Third Branch Court requesting to withdraw their guarantee. The court ordered Qin to find new guarantors within a specified period. Qin only managed to deposit 1,000 yuan, and could not find any new guarantors. The Higher Third Branch Court summoned Hong Xiangtao for questioning and the next day summoned Qin for questioning. Qin arrived at the court accompanied by his concubine and defense lawyer. After questioning by Judge Sun, Qin was ordered to quickly find guarantors within three days, or else the 4,000 yuan deposit would be confiscated. Qin complied and left.</p>

<p>Borrowed Clothes Pawned and Not Redeemed for a Long Time: Fang Baoqing Stabbed by a Friend</p>
<p>Fang Baoqing, a local Shanghainese, 34 years old, residing at 282 Youyi Lane, Balizhao Road, French Concession, has no occupation. Recently, since it was the New Year, he had been going to his friend's room in the Central Hotel on Wuma Road every day to hang out. Another friend, Mr. Jia, had recently pawned Fang's overcoat for eight yuan due to financial difficulties, promising to return it by a certain date. However, the deadline had long passed, and Mr. Jia had not redeemed it. Yesterday afternoon around 6:30 PM, Fang and Mr. Jia met again at the entrance of the staircase on the second floor of the Central Hotel. Fang immediately demanded repayment, and the two got into an argument. Unexpectedly, in a fit of anger, Mr. Jia suddenly rushed to the barber shop on the second floor, grabbed a pair of scissors, ran out, and without asking any questions, stabbed Fang in the right waist. Fang was unable to dodge in time and was stabbed, falling to the ground in pain. The assailant fled in the chaos. By the time the hotel staff arrived, the assailant had already escaped. They immediately reported to the police station. The head detective immediately led Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene and sent Fang to Renji Hospital for treatment. They also took a barber to the police station for investigation. Afterwards, they captured a suspect and took him to the hospital for Fang to identify. According to Fang, although this person was not the actual assailant, he was definitely an accomplice. Fang's injuries are said to be very serious.</p>

<p>According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, after the Public Concession and French Concession municipal councils approved the implementation of the new pay-per-call telephone rates on March 1, users generally want to understand the economic impact. On the surface, the new rates seem like a general price increase, but this is not the case. The telephone company has conducted detailed surveys of monthly call volumes for residential and business users over the past two years to serve as a standard for the new rates. Based on the survey results, nearly half of the residential and business users will reduce their telephone expenses due to the new rates. Furthermore, the pay-per-call method is not a new experiment. Since 1925, ten years ago, hotels, clubs, tea houses, and other institutions that serve many citizens have been charged per call. The new rates will also benefit these users, because the basic rate has been reduced, and the overage rate has been cut in half to three cents per call, whereas it was previously six cents.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Li Dijun, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Information Department, arrived in Shanghai by express train from Beijing at around 7 AM the day before yesterday for official business. He stayed at the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road. After completing his business, he returned to Beijing on the 11 PM express train last night. Former Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Information Department, Zhang Sixu, hosted a banquet for Li Dijun the night before last, with Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city and others in attendance, and invited reporters from various foreign newspapers in Shanghai to meet Mr. Li. Yesterday morning, Li Dijun told a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs currently has two important tasks: one is to revise the diplomatic dictionary, and the other is to compile all of the treaties that our country has signed with various countries over the years. The former task has a special committee for revising the diplomatic dictionary, which will handle comparisons in Chinese, English, and French, making it relatively easy. The latter task is more troublesome because it must be compiled into separate volumes. Except for the Sino-American and Sino-Japanese treaties, which have already been compiled and only need to be supplemented, the others, such as the Sino-British, Sino-French, and Sino-Belgian treaties, must be traced back to their origins and compiled. It will inevitably take a long time to complete.</p>

<h3 id="e154">New Price List Implemented by Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry, Monthly Billing <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Association recently raised raw material prices and old dyeing prices which are calculated per piece cannot offset the material prices, resulting in large losses. Moreover, the length of silk pieces varies daily and the unlimited expansion should be abolished to save the industry. At the last general meeting, it was resolved that from this year, the dyeing prices for all silk pieces will be calculated in municipal meters, and a new price list will be established based on municipal meter calculations. During the revision of dyeing prices, the current socio-economic conditions were carefully considered, the policy of price control and equalization was implemented, and the corrupt habit of price competition among the same industry in the future was eliminated. At the same time, dyeing was carefully improved, and the interests of both the silk and dyeing industries were promoted. Recently, various industries have been advertising "monthly billing" to facilitate the flow of finance and materials. The silk industry is handling acceptance bills of exchange to cope with the recession, opening a source of motivation. The dyeing industry and the silk industry are closely related, and in this economic trend, it was decided to adopt monthly billing to promote cooperation. This suggestion has been voted on, a consent form has been prepared, and the price list has been printed. A general meeting will be convened tomorrow to distribute the forms, which will be forwarded to various silk shops for approval. If any silk shop disregards these regulations and hesitates to postpone the discussion, the association will take emergency measures and implement a dyeing suspension policy.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our clients, Zhong Changyuan, et al., who have stated that the news item regarding a labor dispute in the military cap industry published in the Shen Bao on the 9th of this month contains details that are inconsistent with the facts. Our clients have been adhering to the labor contract established by the bureau and have repeatedly sent letters urging the labor side to return to work. However, the labor side has created numerous obstacles and engaged in excessive extortion. Due to the urgency of the delivery deadline, and in order to maintain credibility and avoid liability for damages, the contractors were compelled to employ legitimate methods to recruit workers and complete production, thereby fulfilling their contractual obligations. However, the labor side, disregarding criminal laws, collectively engaged in violent and coercive behavior, leading a crowd to storm the factory, causing intentional disruption and issuing threatening language, resulting in temporary chaos. Upon receiving the news, the French police dispatched officers to arrest the principal offenders and seize the instruments used for the crime. The other offenders took the opportunity to flee. The report in the newspaper appears to be inaccurate. We have been entrusted to write to clarify the situation to prevent confusion. We respectfully request your newspaper to promptly issue a correction. Sincerely,</p>
<p>To: Shen Bao Newspaper Office,</p>
<p>Lawyer Wang Xintang, February 9th,</p>
<p>主筆先生台鑒、閱七日貴報有「無名男子輾死一節、與事實不符、特此函懇更正、該男子係本行工人、工作已有十二年之久、姓何、名大徵、平日行為謹慎、此决被十路公共汽車輾斃、係該路公共汽車駛行太速之故、然是非自有公論、不願多贅、但請更正如上、且該工人上有老母、下有妻女、境况十分悽慘云、此請撰安、</p>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read your newspaper's report on the 7th regarding the "unidentified man run over and killed," we find it inconsistent with the facts. We are writing to request a correction. The deceased man was a worker at our firm, having worked here for twelve years. His surname was He, and his given name was Dazheng. He was usually very careful. He was killed by the Number 10 bus, which was traveling too fast. Right and wrong are clear to all, so we will not elaborate further. Please make the correction as stated above. Furthermore, the worker leaves behind an elderly mother, a wife, and daughters, and their situation is extremely dire. We wish you peace.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Scott Cup Semi-Finals: Donghua Defeats Xishang Six to Two; Scoring Record: Sun Jinshun Four Goals, Cao Qiuting Two Goals; Donghua and Portugal to Compete in the Finals at the End of This Month</p>
<p>上屆史考托盃冠軍東華隊、作與西商作史盃復賽、於申園球場、春雪初溶、濘滑異常、兩隊健兒、跌仆連連、個個變成錫山泥佛、開幕後西商矯健異常、送往迎來、兩成平局、東華賴孫鐵腿之三箭、以三對二佔先、下半時東華健兒、虎虎驚人、連獲三球、西商則一蹶不振、絲亳無成、遂以二對六之比數、被東華所淘汰、昨日申園座上、觀衆殊不若上週西葡複賽之擁擠、四座看台、空座大半、爲數僅千餘人左右、昨賽西商出場戰士、宿將過半、輔以新進、戰來尚堪一觀也、兩隊陣容如下、</p>
<p>The defending Scott Cup champion Donghua team played against Xishang in the Scott Cup semi-finals at the Shenyuan Stadium. The spring snow had just melted, making the field extremely muddy and slippery. The players from both teams stumbled and fell repeatedly, each becoming a clay Buddha. After the opening, Xishang was exceptionally agile, trading blows and achieving a tie. Donghua, relying on Sun's "Iron Leg" for three goals, took a 3-2 lead. In the second half, Donghua's players were incredibly fierce, scoring three more goals in a row. Xishang, however, collapsed and achieved nothing, ultimately being eliminated by Donghua with a score of 2-6. Yesterday, the stands at Shenyuan were not as crowded as the previous week's semi-final match between Spain and Portugal. The four stands had mostly empty seats, with only about a thousand spectators. More than half of Xishang's players in yesterday's match were veterans, supplemented by newcomers, making the game still worth watching. The lineups for the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>錦順霍威　投桃報李</p>
<p>Jinshun Huo Wei Reciprocity</p>
<p>昨賽兩隊在法官何春輝號令之下、開始接觸、西商發球先攻、從左路進展、尚勷截交前綫、東華右翼聯袂前進、亦以地滑被阻、旋西商得一角球機會、亦交臂失去、兩隊屢進屢退、六分鐘時、賈幼良得球傳中、李義臣略一撥動、孫錦順加上一脚、首開紀錄、中綫開球、西商全軍猛撲、東華門前、雑杳異常、李寗迫成角球、愛格萊夫開來、恰到好處、李寗又以頭頂出險、一轉瞬間、東華門前、又紛亂萬狀、西商中堅、傑克頭攻、中左柱彈回、霍威再加一頂、長脚鹿趕忙挽救、僅着邊際、球已的溜溜在門柱綫上盤旋、一對一時針恰指九分鐘、</p>
<p>Yesterday's match began under the command of referee He Chunhui. Xishang kicked off and attacked first, advancing from the left. Shang Xiang intercepted at the front line. Donghua's right wing advanced together but was also hindered by the slippery ground. Soon, Xishang had a corner kick opportunity, which they also failed to capitalize on. The two teams repeatedly advanced and retreated. At six minutes, Jia Youliang got the ball and crossed it. Li Yichen flicked it slightly, and Sun Jinshun added a shot, opening the scoring. From the center line, Xishang launched a fierce attack, creating chaos in front of Donghua's goal. Li Ning forced a corner kick. Aigraifu kicked it perfectly, and Li Ning headed it out of danger again. In an instant, there was another chaotic situation in front of Donghua's goal. Xishang's central defender, Jack, headed the ball, which bounced back off the left post. Huo Wei headed it again, and Changjiao Lu hurriedly saved it, barely touching the edge. The ball spun around the goal line. The clock showed nine minutes at one to one.</p>
<p>十九分鐘　兩度和局</p>
<p>Nineteen Minutes Two Ties</p>
<p>東華受此意外損失、全軍奮勇反攻、仍以右路開展、家球幼良並騎進迫、勃琪司阻攔不及、鬧成反戈、孫錦順在人叢中穿出、鐵腿飛處、紀錄又開、距西商攻入之球、為時僅兩種鐘、可稱神速之至、東華四座在歡呼中、孫鐵腿又得良機、惜擦柱高越、不勝扼腕、詎禍不單行、秋亭角球、開到好處、李義臣頭攻未凖、西門司惠登漢遠傳前綫、左路三將、捲地而至、搿來忙裏偷射、低而且急、鐘恩撲地挽救、已從臂下漏進網內、距開賽時祇十九分鐘、兩隊各獲兩球、又成二對二平局、</p>
<p>After suffering this unexpected loss, Donghua launched a brave counterattack, still developing from the right. Jia Youliang and Jialiu advanced together, and Boqisi failed to block them, resulting in an own goal. Sun Jinshun broke through the crowd, and the "Iron Leg" struck again, opening the scoring. It had only been two minutes since Xishang's goal, which can be called extremely fast. Amidst the cheers from Donghua's supporters, Sun "Iron Leg" had another good opportunity, but unfortunately, it grazed the post and went over, causing great regret. As if misfortune never comes singly, Qiuting took a corner kick, and it was perfectly placed. Li Yichen's header was inaccurate. Ximen Si Huideng Han passed the ball far to the front line. Three players on the left rushed in, and Hei Lai hurriedly took a shot, low and fast. Zhong En dived to save it, but it leaked into the net from under his arm. Only nineteen minutes had passed since the start of the match, and the two teams had scored two goals each, resulting in another 2-2 tie.</p>
<p>鐵腿飛處　金石為開</p>
<p>Where the Iron Leg Flies, Even Metal and Stone Will Yield</p>
<p>兩隊進展神速、爽脆異常、四座空氣、亦為之緊張白熱、東華反攻令下、球被錦順管束、傳給義臣、射成野逸、俄而秋亭在邊綫得球、渡過義臣、錦順脚頭起處、又中網角、距前球又僅兩分鐘、三對二東華又以一球超前、錦順此球、低而且急、竟被網角絡住、急切不得出、鐵腿英名、可稱當之無愧、兩隊旋進旋退、各得不少良機、義臣頭攻被接、秋亭中柱彈回、霍威脚下失漏、東華幸未遭算、最可惜者、西衛勃琪司犯規、秋亭主罰、幼良衝出一脚、銳急異常、西商門側無人、滿擬必中、詎又中柱彈回、</p>
<p>The progress of the two teams was rapid and crisp, and the atmosphere in the stands was tense and heated. Donghua launched a counterattack, and Jinshun controlled the ball, passing it to Yichen, who shot it wide. Soon, Qiuting got the ball on the sideline, passed Yichen, and Jinshun's foot struck again, hitting the corner of the net. It had only been two minutes since the previous goal. Donghua took the lead again with a score of 3-2. This shot by Jinshun was low and fast, and it actually got caught in the corner of the net, making it difficult to retrieve. The fame of the "Iron Leg" is truly well-deserved. The two teams advanced and retreated, each getting many good opportunities. Yichen's header was caught, Qiuting's shot bounced back off the post, and Huo Wei lost the ball at his feet. Fortunately, Donghua was not scored upon. The most regrettable moment was when Xishang's defender, Boqisi, committed a foul, and Qiuting took the penalty. Youliang rushed forward with a fierce and rapid shot. There was no one on Xishang's side of the goal, and it was thought to be a certain goal, but unexpectedly, it bounced back off the post again.</p>
<p>鍾恩被困　幸未差池</p>
<p>Zhong En Was Trapped, But Fortunately, There Were No Mistakes</p>

<p>Under Donghua's extreme threat, Xishang repeatedly attempted counterattacks, and indeed, where there is a will, there is a way. They besieged Donghua's goal three times. Fortunately, the defense was as solid as a fortress, and Changjiao Lu bravely defended, preventing any surprise attacks. However, although Donghua's momentum was strong, they ultimately found it difficult to maintain their grip due to the slippery field. Once, luck sent the ball to Jinshun and Youliang, who advanced together, but ultimately fell short. Xishang again sent troops, reaching only the foot of the goal. Qiuting hooked the ball from the baseline, but unfortunately, it rolled along the crossbar. Subsequently, both Youliang and Qiuting had excellent opportunities, but the ball either bounced back off the post or flew wide, turning them into pipe dreams. Xishang desperately counterattacked, and Donghua's goal was repeatedly in danger. Zhong En was besieged again, repeatedly fumbling and recovering. Fortunately, luck shone upon them, and they escaped from danger each time. Jia Youliang and Qiuting advanced successively, but Yichen's movements were slow, and the good opportunity was missed again in vain. Xishang revolved three times in Donghua's territory, and the whistle blew.</p>
<p>秋亭錦順　棣蕚雙輝</p>
<p>Qiuting and Jinshun, a Brilliant Pair</p>
<p>迨下半時開始、西商銳氣頓挫、東華進至中途、即被霍威截去、單騎直闖、旁若無人、幸脚頭稍偏斜掠成野球、西商右鋒再射、鍾恩揮臂拍出、李寗加上一脚、送出未遠、再被迫成角球、愛格來扶爾開未逞、混戰達五分鍾、家球幼良、連袂直達西商復地、司惠登漢奔出營救、麥克勞不愼犯規被罰、略一盤旋、錦順之勢一撥、秋亭奔上斜射入網、爽脆之至、掰來亦襲、一瞥即逝、幼良傳中錦順家球、相繼失漏、勃琪司踢成角球家球在十二碼處射門、越橫半寸許、尚勷遠射、以成畫餅、東華又兩失良機、西商兩次反攻、鍾恩營救險球、表演極佳、幼良在邊綫得球、渡過家球、司惠登漢離防出迎、錦順避過、輕輕一撥、送進網中、二十二分鐘時、東華已以五對二勝利在握、</p>
<p>When the second half began, Xishang's vigor was diminished. Donghua advanced to the midway point, but Huo Wei intercepted the ball, charging straight in alone, as if no one else was there. Fortunately, his shot was slightly off and became a wild ball. Xishang's right forward shot again, but Zhong En waved his arm and batted it out. Li Ning added a kick, sending it not far away, and they were forced into another corner kick. Aige Lai Fuer failed to open the scoring. After a chaotic five minutes, Jia Youliang advanced together to Xishang's territory. Si Huideng Han rushed out to rescue, and Mike Lao inadvertently committed a foul and was penalized. After a slight hesitation, Jinshun flicked the ball, and Qiuting rushed up and shot it diagonally into the net, very crisply. Hei Lai also attacked, but it was fleeting. Youliang crossed the ball to Jinshun and Jia Qiu, but they missed successively. Boqisi kicked a corner kick. Jia Qiu shot from the twelve-yard mark, going about half an inch over the crossbar. Shang Xiang shot from far away, turning it into a pipe dream. Donghua missed two more good opportunities. Xishang launched two counterattacks, and Zhong En's performance in saving dangerous balls was excellent. Youliang got the ball on the sideline and passed Jia Qiu. Si Huideng Han left the defense to meet him, and Jinshun dodged past, gently flicking the ball into the net. At twenty-two minutes, Donghua had a firm grip on victory with a score of 5-2.</p>
<p>秋亭一脚　奠定河山</p>
<p>Qiuting's Kick Settles the Game</p>
<p>東華前鋒綫活躍異常、西南亦伺機待發、關李兩衛、防守一無暇隙、復以勝利在握、攻取守勢、秋亭得機、單騎前進、幼良趕上射門、被司惠登漢臥地掰住、尚勷再在四十碼處遠射、恰切橫木、惜被接住　、西商幾度反攻、終未得逞、是時距終場僅兩分鐘、幼良又衝至敵門被拒、一度盤旋排送中央、錦順失漏、秋亭加上一脚、建功而返、遂以六對二奠定大局、西商拼命反攻、李寗迫成角球、愛格來扶方舉足揚鑣、終場笛聲已長鳴矣、</p>
<p>Donghua's forward line was extremely active, and the southwest side was also waiting for opportunities. The two guards, Guan and Li, defended flawlessly. With victory in hand, they adopted a defensive stance. Qiuting seized an opportunity and advanced alone. Youliang caught up and shot, but Si Huideng Han stopped it by diving to the ground. Shang Xiang then shot from 40 yards, hitting the crossbar perfectly, but unfortunately, it was caught. Xishang launched several counterattacks, but ultimately failed. At this time, there were only two minutes left until the end of the match. Youliang rushed to the enemy's goal again but was rejected. After a period of circling, the ball was sent to the center. Jinshun missed, Qiuting added a kick, scoring and returning triumphantly, thus securing the overall victory with a score of 6-2. Xishang desperately counterattacked, and Li Ning forced a corner kick. Aiger Lai Fu was about to kick, but the final whistle had already sounded for a long time.</p>
<p>西聯足球甲組賽　優游力失挫西捕　三比一</p>
<p>West League First Division Soccer Match: You You Defeats Xi Bu Three to One</p>
<p>優游合作佳妙小黑炭尤見神勇　西捕長力不濟僅海爾射中一球</p>
<p>You You's Cooperation Was Excellent, and Little Black Coal Was Especially Courageous; Xi Bu Lacked Stamina, with Only Hair Scoring a Goal</p>
<p>西聯會甲組足球聯賽、優游對西捕、昨日下午三時在膠州路膠州公園交鋒、優游出題以來、每戰皆捷、對於甲組錦標、虎視眈眈、西捕亦係滬上強隊之一、在本屆史高托盃中、曾以三對　淘汰優游、昨日仇人重逢、雙方均出全力相爭、故慕名前往作壁上觀者、約三四千人、實開公園開賽足球以來、未有之紀錄、上半時優游全軍合作、由小黑炭在終了前約三分鐘攻入一球、以一對〇佔優、下半時、西捕抱破斧沈舟决心、反攻甚烈、惜長力不濟、及遭優游諸將趁虛而入、又以二對一再勝、總結果三對一優游凱旋、雙方陣容如下、</p>
<p>In the West League First Division soccer league, You You faced Xi Bu at Jiaozhou Park on Jiaozhou Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Since its debut, You You has won every match and is eyeing the First Division championship. Xi Bu is also one of Shanghai's strong teams and eliminated You You in this year's Scott Cup with a score of 3-0. Yesterday, the rivals met again, and both sides fought with all their might. Therefore, about three to four thousand people came to watch, setting a record for the most spectators since the park started hosting soccer matches. In the first half, You You cooperated well, and Little Black Coal scored a goal about three minutes before the end, taking a 1-0 lead. In the second half, Xi Bu was determined to win and launched a fierce counterattack. Unfortunately, they lacked stamina and were taken advantage of by You You's players, who won again by a score of 2-1. The final result was 3-1, and You You triumphed. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>西捕隊姗姗來遲</p>
<p>The Xi Bu Team Arrived Late</p>
<p>優游隊首先上場、試練脚頭、比賽時間已屆、仍未見西捕隊降臨、迨三時一刻、始姗姗遲來、裁判員陳吉祥銀角聲起、兩隊佈陣而戰、優游隊先取攻勢、鍾育祥脚下撥動阿斗、輸運前敵、小黑炭旁敲側擊、連闖三關、番將克勞福眼看形勢不佳、斜裏竄出、攔住去路、鐘育祥崛起中原、繞道逼入西捕腹地、阿崙躍起揮出、鐘被吉勃生搿位踣地、致未命中、敵將漢萊中路率兵來犯、盤運至相當地域、舉脚攻門、張榮才手脚玲快、振臂盤出、安渡難關、透納東山再起、兵臨優游陣前、海爾強弩冷放、張榮才躍起一托、擊中自己門柱、幸未吿失守、亦云險哉、</p>
<p>The You You team was the first to take the field, practicing their kicks. The game time had arrived, but the Xi Bu team had not yet appeared. It was not until 3:15 PM that they arrived late. The referee Chen Jixiang blew the whistle, and the two teams lined up to fight. The You You team took the offensive first, with Zhong Yuxiang dribbling the ball and passing it to the front line. Little Black Coal attacked from the side, breaking through three barriers in a row. Seeing that the situation was not good, the foreign general Crawford darted out diagonally to block the way. Zhong Yuxiang rose from the Central Plains, detouring and forcing his way into the heart of Xi Bu's territory. Alun jumped up and swung, but Zhong was tripped by Jibson, causing him to miss. The enemy general Hanlai led his troops to attack from the middle, dribbling to a suitable area and kicking the ball at the goal. Zhang Rongcai was quick with his hands and feet, waving his arms and batting the ball out, safely weathering the storm. Turner made a comeback, and his troops approached the front of You You's position. Hair fired a cold arrow, and Zhang Rongcai jumped up to block it, hitting his own goalpost. Fortunately, they did not lose the goal, which was also a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>小黑炭首開紀錄</p>
<p>Little Black Coal Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>劉矮子始讚、邊陲揭竿起義、與許竟成搭擋、三傳五遞、已入西捕深地、許竟成射來、過高越門飛過、此時西捕聲勢大盛、前鋒諸將勢如風捲殘葉般殺奔優游陣地、何奈江陳兩將、保衛如銅牆鐵欄、致三過茅蘆而不入、威利因賣力過甚、受傷出塲、優游隊乘隙反攻、鐘勇森邊陲入寇、銳不可當、風陷西捕防地、立傳中央、王南珍趕之不及、良機坐失、威利乃負傷重行上塲、此後勢常在西捕境內徘徊、優游諸將活躍異常、圍攻敵門、險象環生、惜兩度越位、無功而返、鐘勇森再接再厲、運兵邊域、轉傳敵軍深地、小黑炭迎之以頭、頂上開花、紀錄首開、未三分鐘時間吿終、優游以二對〇佔先、</p>
<p>Liu Aizi began to praise, and the border uprisings rose up, partnering with Xu Jingcheng. After three passes and five deliveries, they had entered deep into Xi Bu's territory. Xu Jingcheng shot, but it flew too high and over the goal. At this time, Xi Bu's momentum was strong, and the forward generals rushed to the You You camp like a whirlwind sweeping away fallen leaves. However, the two generals Jiang and Chen defended like copper walls and iron fences, preventing them from entering. Willie was injured and left the field due to excessive effort. The You You team took the opportunity to counterattack, and Zhong Yongshen invaded from the border, unstoppable, falling into Xi Bu's defense and establishing a central position. Wang Nanzhen failed to catch up, and the good opportunity was lost. Willie returned to the field with injuries. After this, the momentum often lingered in Xi Bu's territory. You You's generals were extremely active, besieging the enemy's goal, creating dangerous situations, but unfortunately, they were offside twice and returned without success. Zhong Yongshen continued to work hard, transporting troops to the border and transferring them to the enemy's deep territory. Little Black Coal greeted them with his head, opening the scoring. Before three minutes had passed, the time was up, and You You led 2-0.</p>
<p>海爾力射成和局</p>
<p>Hair's Powerful Shot Results in a Tie</p>
<p>檸檬過後、易地再戰、西捕抱破斧沈舟决心、謀雪前恥、故全軍奮發、戰來有聲有色、尤以軋許搶球欄刦、別具功夫、不塊為大將之才、奈前鋒諸將所任職位、都未能發展、致失却聯絡、遂至一蹶不振、廻顧優游諸將聲勢凌人、鐘育祥統領三軍、浩浩蕩蕩、侵略西捕內地、兩捕境內乃敵騎滿佈、橫遭蹂躪、鐘勇森見機、由邊疆帶球繞道而進、匹馬單鎗、不計利害、深入虎穴、阿崙出阻擋互撞、兩人同時倒地、球由門前越過、向左滾去、王南珍不忙不慌、趕上命中、惜越位作廢、西捕難期旣渡、傑克邊境謀反、大刀闊斧、連闖三關、乃施調虎離山計、瞞過江善敬、立傳中軍、張榮才不該衝出搶球、海爾枕戈以待、從容踢入網角、構成和局、</p>
<p>After the intermission, the two teams changed sides and fought again. Xi Bu was determined to avenge their previous defeat, so the entire army was invigorated and fought vigorously. In particular, Zhaxu was skilled in stealing the ball, and was a talented general. However, the positions held by the forward generals were not able to develop, resulting in a loss of contact, and they were unable to recover. Looking back, You You's generals were aggressive, and Zhong Yuxiang commanded the three armies,浩浩蕩蕩, invading Xi Bu's inland. The two captured areas were filled with enemy cavalry and were ravaged. Seeing the opportunity, Zhong Yongshen took the ball from the border and detoured, advancing with one horse and one gun, regardless of the consequences, deep into the enemy's lair. Alun came out to block and collided, and the two fell to the ground at the same time. The ball crossed the goal from the front and rolled to the left. Wang Nanzhen was not in a hurry, caught up, and hit the goal, but unfortunately, it was offside and invalid. It was difficult for Xi Bu to cross over. Jack conspired against the border, advancing with great strides, breaking through three barriers in a row, and implementing a plan to lure the tiger away from the mountain, deceiving Jiang Shan Jing, and establishing a central army. Zhang Rongcai should not have rushed out to grab the ball. Hair waited with his spear and calmly kicked the ball into the corner of the net, creating a tie.</p>
<p>三比一優游獲勝</p>
<p>You You Wins 3-1</p>
<p>造成平手後、不啻是雙方緊急關頭、但西捕至此已戰得人困馬疲、不若先前之勇猛、然精神始終一貫、全軍仍努力奔跑、殊堪欽佩、鐘勇森截獲後方來球、帶球直闖、鐘育祥狼狽為奸、左右進逼、在西捕前據作一團、列始讚從人叢中穿出、挑動毛腿、敵鬥再破、陳鎭和接草運糧、鐘勇森捲土重來、一路勢破竹、連破敵軍駐兵、在邊綫十五碼叩門、清脆可觀、又吿中的、兩球之人、前後僅三分鐘、此後西捕雖作困獸之鬥、極力掙扎、奈時不我待、未幾、銀角長鳴、雙方鳴金息戈、結果優游三對一奪得勝利而歸、</p>
<p>After creating a tie, it was undoubtedly a critical moment for both sides, but Xi Bu had fought to the point of exhaustion and was no longer as brave as before. However, their spirit remained consistent, and the entire army continued to run hard, which was admirable. Zhong Yongshen intercepted the ball coming from the rear and dribbled straight in. Zhong Yuxiang acted as an accomplice, pressing in from the left and right, occupying a group in front of Xi Bu. Lie Shizan broke through the crowd,挑動毛腿, and the enemy'</p>

<p>The transmission of Yuan Dynasty songs has been limited to only one type, "Selection of Yuan Songs". Over the past few centuries, those studying the songs have occasionally made discoveries. Mr. Dong Shoujing has compiled supplements, but the gains have been minimal. Lu Qian from Jiangning has spent ten years collecting Yuan and Ming Dynasty Zaju dramas and Sanqu poems, compiling them into two major collections. One of them is the "Complete Collection of Yuan Dynasty Zaju Dramas", consisting of eight volumes, with one volume published each month, included in the "Chinese Literature Rare Book Series". After the publication of the first volume, it was highly praised by readers. Mr. Wu Mei, a contemporary expert in the study of songs, even wrote an article recommending it, and its sales were very wide. Now, the third volume is being published, containing the works of Zheng Tingyu and Ma Zhiyuan, with more than 460 pages and nearly 400,000 words, printed in one thick volume. The retail price is only 60 cents for the popular edition and 80 cents for the special edition. Next week's publication will be the "Selection of Poems from Eminent Women of the Ming Dynasty, Cui Lou Ji", proofread by Shi Zhecun. It is also reported that the Shanghai Magazine Company, in response to requests from readers in various places, will continue to accept pre-orders for one month. Those who pay the pre-order price of seventeen yuan and a postal fee of one yuan and fifty cents can still be accommodated until the end of February.</p>
