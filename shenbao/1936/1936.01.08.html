<p>「做人革命與建國之大道」</p>
<p>我們每一思想、每一言行、必須根於善念、發於誠心、愼所獨處、迭决勿離、要知道天下萬事萬物、都由此誠心所生、都靠此誠心維繫、如果一念不成、則萬物皆假、一切皆歸於虛無、所謂「誠者物之終始、不誠無物」、我們一定要體認得這個至理、並且以戒愼恐懼之心、時刻身體力行、然後才是正心誠意的道理、才可以完成修身的工夫、所謂「誠意　的工夫、最要緊的是「接善固執、」所以我們在誠意之先、必須對於事事物物之是吾善惡、能加以明確的辨別、例如我們必先確切認識並相信三民主義、是救國救世唯一盡善盡美的革命主義、然後可以赴湯蹈火、犧牲自己的一切來實現主義、反之如果不能分明白三民主義是盡善盡美的革命主義、便不能篤信力行、到處要怕危險、怕犧牲了、所以說、「欲誠其意者先致其知」總理對我們一般革命精神、也就是我們一般革命黨員的敎訓、首先就是講「軍人之智」一耍「別是非」第二要一明利害」第三要「識時勢」第四要「知彼己」此外總理還說過、革命的基礎、在高深的學問、這些寳貴的遺敎、就是要我們努力致知、必須致知、然後能誠心誠意來奉行主義、完成革命、至於「致知　的方法、就其中的道理、程子解釋這個道理、最爲明白、他說「所謂致知在格物者、言欲致吾之知、在即物而窮其理也、蓋人心之靈、莫不有知、而天下之物、莫不有理、惟於理有未窮、故其知有不盡也、是以大學始敎、必使學者、即凡天下之物、莫不因其已知之理、而益窮之、以求至乎其極、至於用力之久、而一旦豁然貫通焉、則萬物之表裏精粗無不到而吾心之全體大用、無不明矣、此謂物格、此謂知之至也、我們讀了他這幾句話、便可知所謂致知在格物」者、就是要　即物窮理、比方我今天到中央黨部來、沿途便到處可以看到很多應當改進的事物、我們要做一個革命家—就是要做一個政治家、要治理好衆人和國家的事、最要緊的根本修養、就是要隨時隨地、留心　察硏究一切事物、尤其是一切社會現象、否則你根本就不會知社會國家的事、更如何可以談得上治理好社會國家、完成革命呢、所以「格物」又是我們一切修養與事業之始、「物格而后知至、知至而后意誠、意誠而后心正、心正而后身修、身修而后家齊、家齊而後國治、國治而后天下平、」以上就是大學的八項節目、其中最要緊的一項、就是修身、因爲修身居八目之中、是本末相建、內外相關的樞紐是心物交織、德業交成的關鍵萬、而又是一切人生修養與事業之基本、所以孔子說、　自天子以至於庶人、壹是皆以修身爲本、其本亂而末治者吾矣、」所謂天子」從前是講皇帝、現在我們應當推廣其意、泛諸「領袖、我們一個家庭有家長、一個軍隊有長官、一個團體有領袖一個國家有元首、從國家的最高元首、以至全國國民、都是以修身爲本、身不能修、不僅不能做齊家治國平天下的革命事業、亦不能算是達到了格物、致知誠意正心的目的、所以不能修身、不僅不能做事、根本就不能做人、大學之道的內容、就是「明德「親民」「止於至善」之三個綱領、和以上「格致誠正修齊治平」八個節目、我們要做人必知做人的道理、就是在此、我們要革命要治國平天下、必知革命和治國平天下的道理、革命治國平天下的道理、也就在此、這個精微開展完整一貫的道理、不僅是我們中國政治哲學中獨有的寶貝、而且是我們做人和辦事業之基本的科學方法論、所以我說大學之道、完全是科學的、完全是科軍的大學、我們照大學之道去做、什麼事業都可以成功、不照大學之道去做、不僅一切徒勞無功、而且一定要做到失敗爲止、過去我們一般同志、革命未　不努力、而且非常有犧牲、但是何以到現在革命五十年還沒有成功、甚至國家還弄到如此危急存亡呢、這個道理我們一定要切實反省、澈底覺悟、吾則國家亡了、我們都不知道是什麼道理、如果我們大家能反省覺悟、及時努力、從此以後、大家同心一德、照着革命的道理去做、我們還來得及國家一定可救、革命一定可以完成、兄弟從前在十八歲的時候、大學中庸不知道唸過多少遍、但是並不知道其中道理的重要、甚至因爲革命思想發達、以爲這些陳腐的東西、，完全無用、後來直到了二十八歲的時候聽到總理告訴我大學中庸的重要、，自已還不甚注意、直到三十八歲的時候、自已一切經騐閱歷增加了、再拿這部書來硏究、才覺得眞是重要、差不多一切做人和做事業的道理、統統都在此、以後再每年至少看一遍、愈看愈覺得其中有無限的道理、無窮的奧蘊、直到現在四十八歲、一方面由於不斷的硏究一方面又不斷的反省過去革命不成功的道理、與懺悔過去沒有早照着大學之道來完成革命、自己深覺有得於心可以自信、所以今天在新年第一决總理紀念週中、早將這一番意思貢獻給各位同志、如果我不說、那就對不起總理和各位同志、對不起自己的良心、旣說了就希望各位同志要照着這個中國固有至當不移的大道理來實行、吾則革命便不能成功、國家也就要亡了、那時我們悔悟不及、眞對不住總理、對不起全國四萬萬同胞、對不起我們民族五千年以來之列祖列宗、所以從今以後、我們全黨同志務必互相勸勉、並以身作則、遵奉總理的遺敎、照着這個革命的道理來做、然後才可以爲民衆的模範、不愧爲總理的信徒、也才能使我們黨的生命日新又新、完成救國救民的使命、我們一切做人和革命治國平天下的道理都在此、希望大家努力實行、並祝各位新年健康、（六日中央社電）</p>

<p>— 唐慶增主編</p>
<p>生活標準與生活費用——　趙人</p>
<p>按照個人能力及習慣而需要之事物名為生活標準，為維持此項標準而支出謂之生活費用。</p>
<p>生活標準為現時現地各人所需之事物，其他未及滿足慾望之事物正多，是以生活標凖隨時隨地均可依各人能力之推進而提高擴充。自個人觀之，事物需要之擴充，為個人努力之結果。自全體觀之，社會進步之原動力，卽基於個人努力以求現時現地生活標準以外事物需要之滿足。過去的歷史，目前的社會，工商軍政各界人士之經營競爭，無論其方法正當與吾，何莫非不滿意於現時現地所採取之各人生活標準，而希圖更進一步享受歷來未曾享受之事物。國際間之紛爭離合，自經濟觀點言之，又莫非為提高本國之一般生活標準，擴充事物需要而努力之象徵。</p>
<p>但在一定時期與一定區域內，生活標準中所包括之事物，顯有精粗美惡多寡之不同。究其决定之原素的有三端。一為社會階級，階級二字之界說，向極籠統，俗有分上中下三級，有分為貧富兩級，有分為勞資兩級，又有分為勞心與勞力兩級等等。雖意義懸殊，而大要則隱涵高尙卑劣之別，此實為不當，吾人以為階級二字旣久用而不便放棄，其在經濟學字典中，應專就職業為區別。因職業不同，及由職業而所處之環境不同，故需要之事物亦異。例如銀行中夥計工廠內工頭及中學敎員，按其收入，則大致相等。但銀行夥計要以外觀漂亮應酬便給為常例，故衣履必特別注意。中學敎員之需要在書籍。而工頭短衣便袴毫不為異，其所需要者又另有所在。蓋不獨為職業而逼其如此，其環境隨職業而變，潛移默化，不知不覺間亦隨化矣。二為收入，收入愈多則所見愈廣而慾望愈增。飲食固不能激增，而品質必較前精細。共他向不在現時生活標準中之事物必漸决引入。收入縮小，則悄耗之事物，無論質與量必須减低。三為物質文明之進步，向所無者今有，向力所未逮者，今以機械之大量製造，水陸交通之便利，而價格跌落，可以購買。今日之西式房屋，其舒適遠勝於高大陰寒之皇宮，二十年前之汽車，三十年前之話機，有幾家能得置備。內地城市之電燈電話，十年前何嘗夢見，今則雖非普及，要不致詫為奇談。以是所謂生活標準，不獨量與質時在變遷，卽其包括之事物本身亦時在改變交替中。</p>
<p>然則生活標準，亦有如俗所謂高與低之別乎？吾人以為高之一字，無論其釋作高尙或高貴，均不妥適。彼居必洋樓，出必汽車，動作均需僕役，可謂高貴矣，陋室靜坐，蔬食布衣，不問榮辱，與世無爭，可謂高尙矣，而吾人僅認前者為奢侈，後者為怪僻，為個人之奇特行為。生活標準最足以影響國家前途者，却有最低生活標準與適當之生活標凖兩種。所謂最低生活標準，必須包括食衣住三者，使其有最低之數量與品質，以保持其生存及工作之效率。而適當之生活標準除適當之營養溫暖與起居外，必須有其他事物，如敎育圖書及良好之社交與娛樂等，　激促進共智力體力與文化上之貢獻。量低生活標準不能維持，則幸而存，其子，孫必衰弱呆鈍，不幸而死，則人口减少。適當之生活標準不能保持，則不流於驕奢淫佚，卽失於孤陋自苦，兩者均非改進民族之道。</p>
<p>抑生活標凖一經個人及其環境决定後，欲繼續維持或進一步求擴充以往之生活標準，其勢力可影饗人口之增减，蓋吾人所談之標準非僅個人而實包括受其供養之家屬。結婚而生育為自然之理，但子女之敎養需時，而個人之收入增加有限，卽使個人在世，能維持以往生活標準，甚或大有擴充，而難保其子孫各得維持目前之標準，不墮家聲。故稍具遠見者，或慮共自身晚量堪虞，或慮身後之子孫流落貧賤，而事先節制生育。英國貴族之爵位財產僅傳長子，中國舊俗長子分佔遺產獨多，法國普遍之晚婚與節育，雖方式不同，而用意在保持某種生活標凖歷世而不墜則一。共影饗於人口，則以法國長期停頓在四千萬人左右最為顯著。反之如中國近數十年來，因國內外政治經濟之變亂，社會收入顯有縮减，而人口增加仍如往昔，故一般的生活標準，遂不得不長期的繼續的跌落。今日一般農民之生活，實瀕於或已降至饑餓錢以下，此則人所共知，而農村救濟之說紛起之原由也。</p>

<p>記者以民國二十四年十一月二十日。乘赴歐遊學之便。到錫蘭遊覽半日。其地為佛敎聖地。古稱師子國。景蹟文物。頗多足紀之處。爰分述如下。</p>
<p>錫蘭為印度半島東南之一島。與大陸隔峽相望。峽中多珊瑚島散布如橋。稱亞當橋。其地的為束經八一度。北緯七度半。處熱帶中。氣候甚熱。無所謂四季之分。人口五三〇三〇〇〇多棕黑色。蓋印度歐羅巴種也。現為英國直轄殖民地。首邑哥倫波（Colombo）在島西南岸。為歐亞航路要衝。島中重要物產。如樹膠，椰子，茶葉，烏木，黑鉛等均從此出口。舊都堪地（Kandy）在島中心之山上。距哥倫波七二英里。古剎名蹟甚多。相傳釋迦嘗到此傳敎。有菩提樹一株。係從印度第一聖樹（釋迦曾於樹下悟道。故稱菩提。菩提者梵音覺悟也）分枝生長者。今印度原樹已亡。此二千餘年之老幹仍巍然獨茂。又有佛齒一枚。存佛殿中。傳為釋迦所遺。</p>
<p>記者因與錫蘭高僧衲羅達（hikkbuNarada）同舟。故到哥倫波登岸遊覽。卽由彼介紹一當地施主名查牙華登那（JR.Jayawerdena）者。招待一切。計先赴佛敎圖書館。次參觀數佛寺。决遊覽市街。最後在查宅午餐。餐畢。因查君另有公事。略坐小談。盡歡而散。</p>
<p>佛敎圖書館所在地。名跋夷拉拉瑪（Vajirarama,Bambalapitiya）中有一年約五十許之大師主持。法號似為賽薩達（Sasada）。藏書以佛敎及佛學為限。的數千本。以梵文及英文為多。住僧多能盡心研究。衲羅達（Narada）法師著書多種。其佛學研究一種。在滬佛敎凈業社有譯本。衲師此决東行。遍歷華日星加坡瓜哇等地。其主要目的為護送錫蘭菩提聖樹嫡傳嫩芽一枝。移植中國。俾宏佛法。順道視察東方佛敎現狀。在滬備受佛敎同道歡迎。臨別贈詩甚多。</p>
<p>錫地習俗。見法師必須合十跪拜。入寺必須就門外除卸鞋帽。禮拜如來必須供奉生摘香花。瞻仰菩提聖樹不得採摘生葉。記者前赴數寺巡禮致敬。如俗奉行維謹。因之得遍觀聖跋。頗足慶幸。查佛殿巾所見聞者。多與中土逈異：　殿之建構。均作八角形。絕無樓閣。惟作同心八角形數層。繪塑佛像。其規模狹小。殊無我靈隱佛殿所表示之雄大風度。　如來佛像均姣好如女子。且雙耳有穿珥痕跡。耳被拉長。而洞亦拉長。　以如來佛為信仰中心。絕無所謂彌勒，羅漢，觀音，韋陀，文殊，普賢之類塑像。　壁畫甚多。均屬油彩。查所繪示乃如來佛一生之經歷及靈蹟。栩栩如生。所塑像亦均表示佛之傳道靈異事蹟。人物逼眞。且像後方及左右均加壁繪。益覺生動。像及畫俱有西歐作風。　生花供奉。淸香整潔。絕無香燭楮箔之混濁氣味。　只有巨鐘。而無木魚，罄，鼓，及其他嘈雜法器。　入廟必須先在門外脫鞋除帽。　講經時公開。任人可聽。　西人信佛甚多。有西人捐建之佛殿（有一名佩特立斯D.Ddward　H.Pedris者。因任職政府。而又信佛。被人謀害。死於一九一五年七月七日。其父母為專建宏偉之佛寺一區。中有佛殿。經堂，佛塔，齋堂，僧舍，聖樹等。殿中其他西人所捐供之雲石祭桌允多。）來頂禮者多屬西人。只有兩三點。與中國相同。　合十跪叩。　空門巾亦有不守淸規。偷食肉類者。　光頭着袈裟（實則纏身布一條而已）頭上亦無火灼戒痕。</p>
<p>查釋迦牟尼佛生於紀元前六二三年。為中印度迦比羅國Nepal王子。族剎其安人Sakyan名悉達多喬答摩Siddbattha　Gotama年十六。娶公主耶輸陀羅Yasidhara處於安富尊榮中者十有三年。至年二十九始出家。苦行六年。一日坐菩提樹下。恍然有悟。遂成涅槃。然佛敎雖發祥於印度。而在印度今日不盛行。反於錫蘭·緬甸·中國·日本·頗占勢力。所謂禮失而求諸野者非歟。</p>
<p>錫蘭街道均甚整潔。道旁隨在多有椰棕。及葉多斑點之園景小樹。居屋極小巧玲瓏之能事。且屋必有園。已成不易之事實。查君之住宅允佳。在我人目中。可稱作一淸凉別墅。屋雖僅地面一層然佈置井然。陳設美觀。查君同居母妻弟妹各一。見客恭敬有禮。蓋均曾入校受中等敎育者。食前查君先飲余以擰檬水。椰心水。並贈余菩提葉數片。The　Life　of　Buddha"（衲法師著查君出資印行）一本。食時嘗試印錫土人風味。葷素均加咖唎。用指廢刀叉。搏飯菜入口。歸眞返樸。頗覺有趣。食後飽啖木瓜及香芽蕉。痛飲瓦壼雙蒸水（法以開水置瓦壺中。待冷連壺再煮。因之富於泥土味及火烟氣。却之不恭。只得皺眉下咽。）一餐異味。於是吿畢。</p>
<p>錫蘭男子服裝。上身線紗汗衣。下身繫裙。赤足。間有裸體繫三角布者。中上流人士多改西裝。婦女上身只着乳兜式短衣。露肩甚闊。雙臂全裸。兩乳高聳衣外。富曲線美。下身彩裙。赤足。所着屐或拖鞋式如中日合璧。中上流改着西服則與男子同趨勢矣。</p>
<p>錫蘭市政尙佳。在英政府經營之下。建設亦大有可觀。至於行政。昔嘗苛待土著。今則因印度甘地努力之影饗。已較前寬弛矣。華人在此經商者不多。大都絲販。錫幣盧比與華幣時價的平換</p>
<p>記者到錫蘭之前一日。意船郵康悌羅素亦到。該船因國聯實行經濟封鎖之故。寄艇時。徵租檢貨限制購油。諸多留難。聞一時頗有狼狽之象。（二十四年十二月一日徐震池寄自蘇彝士Suez）</p>

<p>羅斯福新政又一打擊</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國最高法院今日已將新政全部農業計劃所寄之農業調整法、判爲不合憲法、該法已繼復興法而失敗、實爲美國司法歷史上最重要之一頁、上訴人爲胡薩克棉織廠、訴稱棉產物之營業稅不合憲法、最高法院法官九人、僅向稱自由派之三人、意見不同、多數方面爲院長休士及法官提望德等六人、法官羅伯茲平日亦抱自由主張、今日竟由彼宣讀多數方面之意見、聲稱控制農產、雖爲自由協定、並由政府償付津貼、然究屬不合憲法、因此項計劃、係利用聯邦政府之經費、而「購買人民之服從」云、羅氏並稱、如此種理論可以維持、則政府卽能用其徵稅之權力至任何一州、重新支配當地之實業人口矣、羅氏亦言及尚待判决之彭海德棉產統制法、謂該法較之農整法、更有强制執行之權力、現在農整法旣被判無效、於是所有麥米·烟草·糖·紙等等農產品之營業稅、及全部農產控制之統系、皆已成爲非法、至於胡薩克廠所提控案之外、全國各處之棉麥廠家向各地法院攻擊營業稅者、共有一千三百五十六起之多、此間一般人之意見、以爲最高法院此决之判决、對於羅斯福總統之復興計劃、較之推翻復興法允爲嚴重、因判决之後、政府卽不能徵收基本稅品之營業稅、其對於農人所負千萬債欵亦將無法淸償、而農業調整局亦將如復興行政局之必須解散矣、判决書宣布之後、白宮方面卽稱、總統一時並無批評、觀察者謂、此决之判詞非常堅决、政府當難於另立他法、以爲替代云、（六日國民電）</p>

<p>穩定外匯頗收成效</p>
<p>國外銀價慘落後、外商銀行限制買賣外匯、中中交三行外匯買賣驟增、幸經竭力穩定、始收成效、昨日中央銀行掛牌倫敦為一先令二辦士半、紐約二十九美元七五、巴黎四百五十一法郞、與前定標準數相等、匯豐銀行掛牌倫敦一先令二辦士三七五、紐的二十九美元五、巴黎四百四十七法郞、外匯平市委員會、昨晨公佈之平衡稅率、已降至百分之七·七五、已恢復十一月四日以前之行市、各外商銀行均允繳出現銀掉換法幣、故納稅運銀出口者已絕、</p>
<p>銀行行市委會撤消</p>
<p>自中中交三銀行無限制買賣外匯後、銀行業同業公會、將業規第七條公佈國內外行市條文刪去、並於一月四日起、停止公佈國內外行市、將行市委員會組織撤消、至於國外匯兌委員會、曁核定國外匯兌之各經紀員及章程、雖未撤消廢止、但事實上凡經營國外匯兌之銀行、如浙江興業·浙江實業等、以後對於買賣外匯、均照中央銀行掛牌辦理、僅取佣金而已、</p>

<p>虹口產科醫院院長被控玩忽業務　原吿瀝陳醫士需索手術費之經過</p>
<p>口產科醫院、設於海寗路九百十三號、係南通人沈兆荃所創、沈自任院長、上年十二月一日夜半、住居北河路三十七弄十二號寗波日報館職員鄭太慈之妻分娩、當請該醫院產科醫生男女兩人到家接生、經兩醫施用手術、將胎兒取出、業已斃命、而產婦亦從此臥病、雖經該院連續派醫治療、但延至是月七日、產婦</p>
<p>依然身死　鄭太慈旣悲兒殤、復悼妻亡、卽認定由於該醫院醫生玩忽業務所致、遂向第一特區地方法院對其院長沈兆荃提起傷害及詐財之刑事自訴、而沈則不願尸此咎、故亦控訴鄭太慈妨害名譽等情、昨日下午、由楊推事開庭、傳集兩造研訊、當據原吿鄭太慈訴稱、十一月一日夜半、往虹口醫院延醫、該院卽派</p>
<p>何姓女醫　與張姓醫生到家、先將產婦打一針、仍不產下、該醫生遂言須施手術、並謂手術費分有等級、大概由七十元至三百元、我以經濟困難、一再求减、結果减至三十五元、並着我立據書明、不負生命危險責任、而手術費更須先付、我當時祗付四元、且値深夜、無從籌餘欠三十一元、該醫復命立據、限决日二時交付、所有兩紙字據、均</p>
<p>着我覔保　祗得轉挽二房東蔡姓簽字作保、該翳生始行施術、直至三時半、方將胎兒取出、彼等卽稱、小孩生命、不能擔保、產婦由彼負責、臨去則索車資、我乃給予小洋兩角、銅元二十四枚、自决日起、該院連續遣人來索所欠之手術費、聲言何姓女醫生將他往、應結淸手績、更命我繕一報吿書致院長、聲明產婦</p>
<p>已無關礙　第四日我往面見院長、並告以何張兩醫當夜之態度、乃被吿則稱彼這醫院院董、俱屬海上名人、並否認何張兩醫有強索舉動、一面又親偕韋醫生到我家、開示兩種藥名、經我購就、復為產婦打針、詎至七日產婦竟死、死後尙仍血流不止、我曾遍叩諸醫、方悉被吿所打之針、僅能</p>

<p>受傷靑腫　發育阻碍、上年十一月十四日深夜、鍾叉將來發毒打、二房東即法捕房探員李連生發現小孩來發身有重傷、以鍾慘無人道、遂報告法捕房、將鍾其昌逮捕、並搜出鴉片烟具、及用以毆打小孩之籐條木捧等物、解送特二法院、由法警務處依妨害自由、使人為奴隸、傷害、吸食鴉片、等四罪、提起公訴、經王綱煦庭長開庭</p>

<p>鴉片烟具　父親在日吸用、故後未拋棄、我有時發胃病、偶爾吸用、幷供孩父褚阿龍、昨日來滬、今日亦到案、請求傳訊等語、繼傳證人小孩褚來發至案前、供述被鐘供、年四十四歲、平湖人、業廚房、來發是我决子、因家貧託成衣匠蔡萬順介紹、寄在鍾家、當時未取錢、决子因大兒病、向少爺借洋十七元、此决因得悉發生此事、來滬探望小孩、餘詞</p>
<p>均屬袒護　上訢人之語、但小孩見其父立在身傍、忽嚶嚶哭泣、向訊何故哀哭、則不答一言、官查閱法醫診斷書上詳列被害人身上傷痕、據以訊鍾、鍾絕口否認傷害、而小孩稱即被用案上之籐條毆打的、官乃怒向上訴人、爾是讀書人有高尙智識的、何如此慘無人道、訊至此、庭上認為案情已明、即命開辯論後、即宣告終結、定於十四日下午二時宣判、上訴人仍交原保、</p>

<p>— 中國徵信所主編</p>
<p>（一）沿革　橡膠之在吾國，亦新興工業之一，始於廣州，盛於上海，寖假而至今日，上海一埠，幾為該廠集中之區，故言橡膠業之興衰者，僅及上海，可概其餘，考該業在國內之始創者，當推廣東兄弟樹膠公司，民六設廠於廣州之河南，（今日已有港粵滬三廠）為南洋華僑歸國創辦，次之則民九開辦之江灣模範工廠之橡皮工塲，其時該項工業，不為人所注意，該廠後亦因經費支絀而停辦，直至民國十六年，始有義昌橡膠廠之設立，即今日之正泰，翌年更有大中華廠崛起，規模宏大，執今日同業之牛耳，自是以往，三年中如雨後春筍，先後成立者，不下五六十家，瀋變滬變以後，新設者逐漸减少，間有移動，大都係改組接盤，降至近日，倒閉停工，時有所聞，新創者似已絕無僅有，故吾人言上海之橡膠業，可分為三期，自大中華廠開設後數年，為橡膠業全盛時期，瀋滬變後，市面衰落，都會農村，購買力同時减低，同業旣多，生產過剩，不得不貶價求售，五相傾軋，資本較大者尙可支持，小者則不免於淘汰，於是此仆彼繼，險象環見，是為該業掙扎時期，洎乎最近，國民經濟枯竭日甚，日貨復大量傾銷，本國產品，雖售價跌至成本以內，亦不足與抗，最後一着，祇有停工或倒閉，蓋已及於極度衰落之期矣。</p>
<p>（二）現有各廠　根據最近調查，現在上海之橡膠廠，正在開工者，計南華·大中國·永和·大中華·交通·中國工商誼記·義生·大中央·正泰信肥·宏大·大安·世界·義源·大中興記·大陸·上海寳業·華興·益昌·華通·正大·永大·大上海·民生·春華發記·義和·協康·利亞·大生·永茂·等二十九家，暫行停工者，計廣東兄弟·南陽·德員·華商·等四家，正式宣告停業者，計大用·大德·意大利·大來·大新·江南·等六家，在籌備中尙未開門者，計閘北·寰球二家，以尙在開工及暫時停工者而論，當以大中華橡膠廠範圍為最大，資本計國幣二百萬元，餘廠多者二三十萬元，少者僅一二萬元，在五萬元左右者為最普通，其組織方面，最早以獨資或合夥所佔成份較多，人後情形轉變，新設者固多股份有限公司，舊有者改變為公司組織，亦不乏其例，蓋一方由於人材資本較易集中，而投資者所負責任，亦可較輕，此固一般工商之趨勢，不僅該業為然也。</p>
<p>（三）原料　上海各橡膠廠，除大中華外，資本均未見充實，已如前述，故原料一項，完全依賴廠外供給，即以範圍最大之大中華而言，亦祇主要原料炭酸鈣·鋅養粉·及染織可以自給，欲求如外商鞋廠之一釘·綫之微，亦不外求，實非易事，但原料品中種類甚多，雖取給於廠外，尙非完全舶來貨品，其中國內自有者，如上海順昌石粉廠·肇新化學公司。及興業化工廠之炭酸鈣，寗波五峯廠·鎭江家庭工業社之炭酸鎂，上海大豐工業原料公司之亞鉛華，上海開林油漆公司之胡麻子油，以及各織布廠出品之襯布，但基本原料橡皮，及有機性這硫化促進劑，與夫各色顏料，仍不能不惟外貨是求，故自新幣制推行以來，該業出品，已一度聲明漲價，蓋原料受外滙影響，成本增高，有以致之，各項外貨原料，橡皮以嗬囒橡皮公司及好時洋行經手最巨，顏料則德孚下內門二洋行，汽油則美孚亞細亞德士古光華等，供給最多，其他物品，則魯麟洋行及好華公司等亦有供給。</p>

<p>春秋說遊  （陳建華）　　「為什麽要出遊呢？因為出遊是一件樂事，可以玩玩不做事。」這是通常一般人對於「遊」的見解。但是「遊」也有它相當的價值，雖然化了錢累了人，而所得是倍於所失的。在長時期的工作之下，實在覺得悶人，所以我們時常憧憬着新的境界的發現；在無量數的方法之中，以「遊」為最樂。古人秉燭夜遊，這不是十足表示出「遊」的樂趣嗎？然而遊的益處，並不止這一點：當我們遊覽某一個地方，或是山，或是水，總有一些勝蹟，這些勝蹟，往往有聖賢豪傑孝子忠臣的史實，足以動人觀感，流連憑弔之餘，我們的心理上德上，已受了它的陶冶，或是學問在無形中已得了進步。退一步說，至少也可以吸得一些新鮮空氣，使我們身心上舒適一下。便是飛禽走獸，花木草右平時雖常常看見，但是都如困在「象牙塔中」，那能像自然抱懷中的那般自然呢？我們若能用心一考究，一玩味，也有特殊的情趣的。由此看來，「遊」之益，那可盡言呢？龍井阻雨  叔範　　薄宦歸來，，兩載不入西湖深處。聽曉窗鳥鳴，輒憶胡公嶺下不止，心以造象，若有樵斧溪聲和焉。會去秋復於役錢塘，略拂塵裝，亟理舊遊。循花港觀魚折入三台山，吊於公祠華；入門，丐者聚而炊，薰壁作　　色，　水殘山，留此破廟，誦我來何處哭英雄之句，浩歎無浩歡無已！傍祠，有賣栗翁，舊曾向乞飲，與話山居生活，輒自方為世外人；今則龍鍾頹喪，若深隱憂。詢之，謂為栗荒柴賤，日資漸虞不給矣！念孰具乾坤轉旋手，重為足衣而足食之？陟風　嶺，天晦，白雲離松頂不盈尺，釀疎雨絲絲下，着業，　綠氣如烟，望四山都如此，宛然靑蓮花世界也。過二老亭，傴而登，入寺小憇，擬雲開深入獅峯，而上窮天門。顧淅瀝未已，茗坐以待。考龍井碑刻，舊以淮海詩為最完好。數叩寺僧，都未有對，吾疑堦前積疊之亂碑中，雜此片石，或未可知？然無力役香伙起之，一快我摩挲也。龍井水味，纖野不及理安，而清　則過似虎跑。在一勺亭內，幽坐冥索，有松火熊熊活，石泉涓涓響：東望斷嶺缺處，西湖露半規匳影，幻水氣為烟為雲，若白袷御風不定者。蓋雨勢猶甚勁也。亭有　茶者，列葉十餘種，標値每斤自四角至十六元不等。最貴者為五棵茶，產獅峯，遜淸高宗幸浙時，疆吏採以進，飲之，以為太和之氣，瀰滿齒頰，無味之味，味之上者，因錫是者。猶泰岱之大夫松也。市茶者謂五老樹，今猶在峯頂：顧余曩歲三探雲峯，何嘗見一樹苦檟哉？大抵杭茶，採自靑草台萬年背一帶者為多，冠以獅峯，沿舊傳也。是處環山茶戶，的百數十家，最多者，可採至百許擔，故全山產額，年不下四五十萬金，用是生活頗為優裕，的略桃源洞裏人也。坐久，濕雲不褪，寺鐘催歸，念胡公嶺近在咫尺，竟無山再至，一切如是觀，　徒飲啄關前定哉？蠡湖冬泛  陳亮　　滿抹了鉛灰的天慕反映在旅者的心坎裏是沉　的。從蠡　出來，踐着新築的泥沙路，迎着充溢陰蠡之氣的冷風前進。雯淑嘴裏噓出伏爾加的拍子。枯焦的葉片盡在破皮靴邊打旋兒。前面沒有行人，後面亦祇剩白蘆在嘆息。寂寞的行程呵。在寳界橋畔我把伊扶上了蝦船。　　蝦船仍是阿大的，半年的違別，他那健康的深赭色的肌膚如今已被靑色布襖遮蔽了，脚可依然赤露着，薄而短的玄色布單褲飄零在船梢，時日眞和流水一般，回憶夏天和　淑一同在船上問阿大有吾婚娶，而他祗是會着羞意的微笑，望着我倆不作回語的時候，幾乎如在昨日。快呵，快呵。在蠡湖滾滾的水浪上，想要撩起或凝住一個暫短的追念都是不容易的。　　沿路山脚下開石子的工人亦稀少了，一條黃犬在那灘邊的茅屋　下彳亍，嗅着光赤的，連一支小籐萆都已死了的地面。船經過孤淸的獨山天更陰黯了。從更陰冷的湖風中傳來了萬頃堂朱色寺門內古老的銅鐘聲。眞太幽靜了呵，鼋頭渚上山木的紅葉那麼悵惘地望着外太湖點點的白灰色帆，深黯棕色帆。這種天氣那裏還有登山的呢，山門口躺着一輛少了後輪的壞汽車。　　小箕山的木板埠頭冷落而充溢着悽感，夏天，春天，和明爽的初秋，這裹常常是船夫爭生意的所在。如今，除掉我和雯淑的瘦影外，只有兩三株紅楓，幾行翠色冬靑樹，和幾座寳塔松的差强人意的點綴了·為着不忍受寂寞和肅殺的過量刺激，我們終於仍在蠡湖上泛着暇船回去。寂寞的行程呵。清風弔古  白華　　當新蒿公路還沒有開始通行的時期，我們上省坦杭州？都得坐一夜「櫓聲　乃」的烏篷船。從劍溪的上流，緩緩地，輕舟一掉，打灘聲水色裏盡過，跟着再行的速率，鄕村，田野，慢慢地移動着落向後面去，溪面漸漸廣闊起來，大概在夕陽將快西斜的辰光，面前展開深沉浩渺的水波，便駛過淸風嶺的底下了。淸風嶺距離曹娥江不到三十多里，同孝女曹女為尋你屍葬身江流的一樣被後世人敬仰崇拜，相傳是王烈殉難的地方。　　　峻高聳的峯嶺後面，隱現出猪紅色的廟宇。在峯端，凌空飛峙着一塊岩石，據說就是淸風娘娘（後世稱為清風娘娘）殉難時最後一步的站立處，故事是如此開展的。　　宋朝在內憂外患文迫下傾覆了，那時遍山野都被胡兒的鐵騎蹂躪着，王烈婦本是天台縣人，給元兵一部份的頭目擄來了，路過淸風嶺上，大概因為人馬的疲乏需要休息的緣故，王烈婦想到遲早終不免受辱，就趁這時候，潛逸出外面，望着狂湧的浪　裏跳下去了。常伊預備要縱身跳下的頃刻，還咬破了手指，　出指頭的血，靠岩壁寫上了一首七律詩：「君王無道妾當災，素女拋兒逐馬來」。但現在，顯詩的地方只剩斑爛的苔痕，巳經不能够摩認了，只記得結末是這樣的一句：一存亡兩字亦哀哉」！　　為耍保留這壯烈的　蹟，後人在伊站脚過的岩石邊築起了一個亭來，並且立廟以示紀念。廟的左右，掩映着幾業碧竹，幾樹丹楓，還有　　蒲和落的幾家人家。蠡山探幽  汪敏　　蠡山在浙省德淸縣治千金鄕？據說是春秋時范蠡泛五湖之後，曾經隱居過的，距離我鄉約有三十多里光景，扁舟一葉，輕輕的盪去，沒兩三個鐘點，也就到了。　　這次往蠡山去玩，已是第二次了。早晨，太陽才露臉，我們巳都上了預　的船，因為去的人多，一葉似的扁舟，擠不下許多人，就雇了一艘燕尾船，這船的艙中，容積很寬廣，那梢頭却像剪子似的燕尾一般。一路上櫓聲咿啞，外加人多，談談說說，一點不覺沈悶。船艙外叉都是迎人的靑嶂，在兩岸遠處，好似輾着笑顏。波平如鏡，沒一絲掠過的風。　　從早晨七點鐘開船，慢呑呑地航着，這三十多里的水程，走了整整四個小時，才把船泊在蠡山脚下。哀我察東！  江敉　　我們飽餐一頓，上岸走去，一忽兒已到了西施橋，橘上留廣西子的屐痕，這雖是後人附會上去的點綴，但，我們到了那裏，只聽見淙淙的泉聲，從橋下流過，便把俗　囂撥去了許多。　　一串人帶着喘氣，慢慢從石　一步爬到蠡山頂上了。大家都透了一口氣；覺得山固不高，也很費力，那兒有所廟，我們也得進去，祗向四邊望望，但見山下炊烟紛起，那些人家，都把屋子隱在靑葱的樹木裹面。沒有囂塵，也沒有喧嘩，祗約略聽得一些鷄鳴犬吠之聲，這情景眞可說是避世的桃源哩。　　我們又從廟傍一條羊腸似的小路，爬下山去；一路上只是管自把眼前認為幽勝的所在尋着方面走，我們在路上，有時也給我們碰到幾個樵夫，他們提着柴枝，口裹唱着山歌，大家沒理會，，各自在身傍掠過。誰說我們不是置身在盡圖中呢？　　蠡山的勝境，像劍池，　潭，日月淵，石屋等等，都給我們走遍了，我們尋到了嵯峨的怪石，削立的山壁，巖巖下面的泉潭，楊柳聞着的大池子，池子裏給山風吹得如縠紋般的碧波，竹林深處山洞似的石屋子，終於在一座尼庵裏，休息了片時，才大夥兒下了船，趁着晚發的東風，掛帆歸去。蘭溪選勝  軼劉　　蘭溪居浙江之上游，扼金　之衝，閩北贛東皖南諸鎭，佔舶咸集於此抱布貿絲，恃為轉　樞紐，故向來市肆特盛一。自浙湘路成，陸運便捷，水輪代謝，而蘭溪貿易，遂渝同僻壤，人事遷徙，信不可知也。蘭溪之城無雉堞，高如通巷短垣，隍池逈異他處、蓋不繞城外而環城內。穿城入，巨　赫然當前，殊關大，對岸皆石駁，軒窗四敝，人影如潮，蓋皆市樓也。渡橋前行，越短卷始為通衢，石平如砥，密無機罅，履之堅穩爽潤，街街　廣，遠勝二十年之上海，內地小邑，乃逾通都，亦異事也。商肆宏儘整潔，比戶列櫃，凈若明鏡，絕無織座，肆中人衣履樸潔，不染微垢。水脈縈帶，淸澈明漪，小山四繞，爽秀朗潤，故廣民皆肌理瑩潔，　比朝霞，樂令中年，衛玠章角，徧地皆然，允以巾　為最，豐若有餘，柔若無骨，枇杷花下，復護門前，回眸一睞中，不知有多少銷魂種子。其地密邇江山，九姓之後連檣比翼而居，土名菱白船，不知何所取義，予旣久醉竹坡之遇，甫下車，便作問津漁父。先就飯於酒家樓，淺沼一泓，危樓半角，有略徇通其堂，登樓，玻窗環翠，四山送靑，內饍堂而外茶寮，精潔明凈，倚檻看山，憑軒聽水，疑非市居，飽飲瀹茗，進侍者而叩之，遂得其門而入。下樓出水西關，即大江，沿江行，帆檣無數，有巨艘六七，展翼如雁行，瞰之有人亭亭，媚波欲流，遽引身下，舟中人出艙欵接，眉以語，目以笑者十餘輩，坐定獻花，蕭醇有異味，遠勝紹屬尼菴之鴛鴦茗，茶罷進燜，紅錫包而已。旣而瓜果糖點，雜然紛呈，有粲者手剝瓜仁而以舌進之，香唾未乾，樓榔入口，洋洋乎欲罷不能矣，少選笑謔交作，宛轉嬌啼，伺喜怒如不經意者眞允物也。稍間起行，泥人若不勝，與以錢，轉作薄嗔，擲不受，蓋其例並不取茶圍金，僅恃宴客博資也。船艙極大，區為四五格，自　首而入，首為房間，銅床綃　，方桌圓椅，潔　特甚，中為客堂，可容五六十人，飲啄歌舞胥在是，决為更衣室，再决廚房，量後司舵所居，井然不紊。宴客肴核　美，侑酒者淸歌可達旦，不足則益以他一船，一席之需，連下脚僅十二元，碰和亦取十二元為止，以視蘇錫船菜之浪費無度，相去奚啻霄壤，殆由於生活困難所致歟？船例禁　暱，非積稔特殊者，不能眞個銷魂，年來商市蕭寥，縣令解放，率改他圖，異時來者，必有人面桃花之感矣。黃山雜記  瘦鵑未是草　　匡廬為隱士，黃山是劍仙，俠骨撐天表，神光照大千。　　脚踏黃山石，飄然便是仙，蒲團松上坐，打睡一千年。　　抱衾上高岡，坐待朝陽出，四山睡未醒，哀猿叫殘月。　　瓣瓣出奇秀，萼萼自橫斜，凌波寒海上，一朶妙蓮花。　　峯礙肩頭過，雲從脚底生，李白成仙去，金鰲背上行。　　松如翡翠林，峯似珊瑚船，西海門前立，心驚天地妍。　　攀葛上山坡，峯頭日已暮，羣烏忽驚飛，爭馱斜陽去。　　峯頭雲所宅，峯腋松之家，翠屏千　立，百萬杜鵑花。　　（右五十二首之八）小西天  張恨水著　　第二十三回　繞宇發高談奮將起訴　傾壺聯舊好利可忘嫌　　屋子裹的賈多才，却是越罵越起勁，在罵的當中，還不住的誇着自己是不怕事的。可是他儘管駡，並無人理會他，他駡完了，反是感覺到這旅館寂寞下來。心裏這就想着，他們對我，完全用那不理會的手段，那倒很毒，我若跑到樓上去追着要人，專員不專員，不必怕他，只是那些婦人們，不容分說，又打又鬧，敎人沒有法子可以對付他們。可是不去追問的話，難道就讓這些不相干的人，把自己女人霸佔去了不成？在這種進退兩難的當兒，只管背了兩手，在屋子裏來回的走着。先是在床面前一綫空地上，踱個四五步上下，後來不知不覺，把這地方放寬，由那邊桌子角落，踱到這邊床角落，彷彿這踱着步子的地方大些，心裏也跟着寬慰些，就在這一點上，可以想出法子來。然而他踱了很久很久的時間，依然不知道要怎樣着手。後來索典不想了，向床上橫倒下去，把枕頭疊得高高的，仰着身體睡覺。眼睛望了帳子頂幻想着那上而出了個美人臉，又幻想着不是美人臉，是個獅子頭。停一會，那獅子　幻成了一副倪雲林的山水了。自己忽然一轉念道：我這人到底有些傻病，丟了正經事不去想法子，我當小孩發痴病幹什麽？於是一個翻身，側了睡去，不去看這帳頂。帳頂是看不到了，一切知覺，也跟着消失了，等到自己醒了過來，桌子上已經放了一盞煤油燈，趕快一個翻身跳了起來，便見桌子上放了兩張名片，一張是公安局人員的銜名，一張是法院人員的銜名，自己拿到手上看了一看，却不由得一怔。只管望了名片沉吟着，不能够放下。探首向窗子外張望着，却見茶房由樓上下來，於是向他點着頭又招着手。茶房走進來，賈多才就摸着名片道：有這樣兩個人來拜會我嗎？（三八九）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言一九三六年的語言  夢若　　以前曾預言世界大戰等重要大事的法國著名預言家佛蘭雅夫人，頃又發表其一年一度的語言了。据夫人的猜測，今年一年中，戰爭恐慌，將終年籠罩全歐，惟戰事未必發生，遠東方面，將頗多紛擾，俄滿邊境，將起嚴重事件，印度將有暴動，東菲戰事，不久卽將停止，希臘將有政治擾亂，奧國將復辟，惟難於持久，中美諸國，將有革命，阿根廷將有政變，世界各國，暗殺事件甚多，英法關系，將時呈緊張，惟兩國將維持友好態度，英美二國，將為最與盛的國家。此外，關於各國政治人物的成敗，世界經濟狀況的盛衰，以及人民的生活，戀愛和疾病等，也有所揣新。觀其所作預言，眞是鉅細靡遺，應有盡有，可作為一九三六年的世界大事表看。　　邇來世界大局的紛亂，可謂達於極點，因是語言就應運而生了。東也有人作預言，西也有人作預言。使一班關心時事者，聞之乍優乍喜。預言本為一種揣測這詞，不足取信。蓋世事一日萬變，非易觀察。尤以今日的國際關系，其錯綜複雜，斷非任何人所能預料。他們語言家之作預言，用意不過也只是說說吧了，所言是否能應騐，恐怕連自己沒有半分的把握。　　然預言也非全不可靠者，至少有根據的預言，有時也能成為事實。例如以佛蘭雅夫人這决所作的預言，加以研究，目前的歐洲，正如一所火藥庫，導火錢一燃，隨時都有炸發的危險。法德的對立，英意的交惡，這狀態是極明顯的。故夫人說，今年戰爭恐慌，將終年籠罩全歐，這話確有見地。僅管各國和平之聲，高唱入雲，它們和平越喊得響，便越覺得戰事之愈緊迫。至若遠東方面的增加紛擾，也是必然的形勢。看摟來獨霸主義者那樣蠢動，和太平洋風雲的漸呈險惡，便可以想像到未來的多事了。　　惟關於暗殺的預言，在政局不安之時，暗殺事件的發生，本屬常事？但佛蘭雅夫人的解釋，却極玄妙之至，說各國今年暗殺之所以多，是因為今年為土星和海王星的勢力，火星也有聯絡之故。這就太無稽了。　　對於這項一九三六年的預言，我們只好姑妄聽之　，橫竪事實就能給我們作證明的。鄉村女學  艾美　　當么叔的大女兒，淑姊十四歲的那一年，我們底村里才第一决有一個女學。是一個在街上開南貨店的村里人出來提倡辦的。七嬸婆生氣地敲着拐杖，說是三十年來僅有的奇事。　　這學校設在村祠堂內，敎員宿舍也附設在裏面，先生是一個初從省里什麽女學出來的學生，面孔圓圖的，身材瘦弱得幾乎要使人懷疑她是剛從病榻里起來不久‘的截髪，短裙，現着一付十足省派的摩登樣兒。初來的那一天，她便上　叔家去，　叔慨然地答應了，於是又上另外的幾家去接合，但都碰了壁回來。後來總算靠了　叔的鼓吹才勉强凑了十幾個學生開班，那時我還只有十三歲，每回從學堂外經過，聽見那嘹然的書聲也着實羨慕，因此有一回我便對母親提起，她也是七嬸婆一邊人，便生氣地敲着拐杖呌道：「姑孃們要讀什麽書！」　　日子平穩地像流般的過去，學堂放了年假，七嬸婆為着怕學堂明年再開，她說有許多女孩子都因為學堂的關係而學得壞了，有些為着要求上學竟胆敢和父母吵鬧：於是便帶着拐杖在村里團團的跑，和着六根娘，大興嫂等四五個老太婆到鄕里老大那兒去請求公道，老大答應了她們，說等大衆考慮考慮再說，於是她們便滿意地回家。　　第二年春天，學堂馬先生又趕着一輪驢車，滿載着衣箱舖蓋到村里去，要貼招生廣告開學，七嬸婆聽到又急的去找六根娘商量，六根娘正和六根紅腫着眼睛吵鬧，厚來是六根想呌自已那個十二歲的女兒上學堂去，他說現在的氣運不同了，姑娘家也得認認字，六根娘則抵死不肯，於是乎吵鬧便發生了，六根拍着桌子，六根娘便顫巍巍的死命把頭撞過去：　　「老娘命不要，跟你拚！」頭沒撞過去，早吃七嬸婆在後面拖住，往外面大踏步跑着。五分鐘後，她們又在老大的屋子里，老大在搔着頭，很感困難地擺着手道：　　「這有什麼辦法呢，是公衆的意思啊！」　　「但是，我們村里幾十年來沒有辦女學，不都也是這麼過去？——」　　「七嬸婆你老人家，恐怕也有好些年頭沒上街去走走，現在的年運是大和從前不同了理！……」　　「咱就不相信什麼時運不同的鬼話，千千萬萬的日子也都過去，偏偏換來了個什麽民國的撈什子喊時運不同，這是從那兒說起？「騙騙光屁股的小孩子……」　　七嬸婆生氣了，於是便拉起拐杖，拖着雲根娘連辭別的話也不說一句便走，到門外回過頭來望大門輕蔑地一看，又憤憤的吐了幾口涎沫。　　馬先生的招生廣吿已經貼上了，有不少人跑去報名，六角釘的那個十三歲姑孃也去，七嬸婆的大孫女兒也整天價地在家里吵嚷着，吵的她爸沒辦法，只好答應。七嬸婆聽到了，念的從後房門起出來，拐杖在地底下敲的得得地響，鳴聲咽氣的哭駡着：　　「沒良心的行貨，你敢答應她！呌她也去學街上那些斷尾狗！（註）　　兒子沒去理會她，反大步的跛着脚出門去，大孫子女兒可已躱進母親底房子里喊死呌活了。碰到這些不肖的兒孫，七嬸婆很感苦氣，想起二十五歲那年起，好容易守到現在，才成了這個雖說不上富有，但却也還能在村里馬虎地過去的家，指望這一家大大少少能够來奉承她底晚境，不想却碰在這些不肖兒孫的身上，怎好不呌人氣苦？想着，她於是更覺傷心了，便眼淚直流拐着拐杖上街去，揚言要上區去控吿馬先生，說她來村里煽惑人心，關於兒子，也要上一狀，吿他忤逆，但是被人把她拖回來，於是她只好氣屈地沿着途哭皇天。　　晚上，六根娘和大興嫂上得家來看看嬸婆，這三個老太婆便關在一個房子里咕嚕若，直到九點半大家才散回去。　　第二天早上，村里風傅着一個可怕的消息，說馬先生的學堂門在夜晚被人塗滿了便溺，幷在屋頂上拋打着石塊。當天下午，便有人看見馬先生仍坐着來時的那輪驢車滿載着衣箱和舖蓋，悄然地出村去了。　　註：斷尾狗是指那些剪頭髪的女學生孤雁  耳禾　　離了都市來到鄉間，已有兩個多月了。這兩個月中不知怎的對都市的懷戀愈來愈濃了。在這裏，雖然有三百多人常在我的週遭，可是我正戚到孤寂，每當黃昏的陰影襲來時，我躺在椅子裏側着眼望着天際的糢糊的雲影，我疑惑自己是一隻孤雁了。孤雁，是的，我該是一隻孤雁。我們的「羣」是在都市裏，可是我已經離「羣」了，我獨自在北地孤飛。這騷動的都市常常給人咀咒，可是我把它作為「羣鶯亂飛，雜花生樹」的美麗的江南看的。因為我們有我們的「羣」呵</p>

<p>。我相信，某一人懷念某一地方，並不是單單在某一地方的景物好，一定某一地方的人和他有相連的關係。譬如一湖水，一朵花，本來也沒有什麽大不了，但假若曾和某人划過小艇的，曾和某人在花旁有過美麗的故事的，於是覺得一湖水，一朵花有令人特別懷戀的地方了。所謂「風景依稀似去年」，並不是單單着眼在風景上，實有「物是人非」之感的　　因此，我知道自己的對都市的懷戀並不是無因的。同時在這裏的感到孤寂也並不是無因的。都市究竟有什麼給我懷戀呢，除了「羣」之外？這裏究竟有什麽使我討厭呢，除了沒有我的「羣」之外？只要有自己的伴侶，滿眼的沙漠可變作滿眼的春光的：沒有自己的伴侶，滿眼的春光會變作滿眼的沙漠的。　　當我剛剛離開都市時，心想「換換空氣也好」，所以當船由十六浦慢慢兒駛出吳淞口時，我看着無際的長空，覺得自己的前途是十分闊大，十分遼遠，我幾乎想說：『我，「新生」了』！可是到了這裏，我漸漸感到孤寂，漸漸感到自己是一隻離「羣」的孤雁了。我望着南方的長天，我的心像星夜的孤雁那樣，是十分凄苦的。　　我是孩子，都市是母親。孩子常久在母親的懷裏了，不免想向外撒野一會。等到倦怠了，他又想起他的母親。此刻我正感到倦怠，我在想着我的母親是——都市。　　盲目詩人愛羅先珂初到北京時喊着：「寂寞呀！哦，寂寞呀！」如今，我彷彿也要喊起來了。其實，北京有什麽寂寞呢？北京不是有許多人嗎？同樣，我這裏有什麽寂寞呢？這裏不是也有許多人嗎？啊，寂寞，只是為了我是一隻離「羣」的孤雁所以感到寂寞了。一隻孤雁，就是在整千整萬的人羣中牠也始終是一隻孤雁呵。　　老是上講堂，老是埋首在課卷裏，老是在偏僻的臥室裏躺着，我眞有些厭倦了。當黃昏在老柏樹邊，老銀杏邊旋轉着，旋轉着，旋轉到我的屋際來時，我是怎樣的難耐呵。又是冬天，又是並不向陽的屋子，我蟄伏着，像蝸牛那樣的畏首畏尾……冬天的太陽老是南偏得很遠很遠，上午九十點鐘身子正需要暖暖的時候，可是抬頭望去，一眼就看見孔廟的很大的陰影橫在我的屋前。看着牆角裏的一株永久見不到陽光的菊花，我有些可憐我自己了。我不能找一個人來談談，我只孤雁那樣嘗着孤寂的滋味。有時小雀子也在我的面前放肆，牠常常從孔隙裏飛進我的屋子來，吱吱喳喳的呌着，牠的「如入無人之境」的態度的確使我懊惱，我喊着「嘶」，可是牠不以為意，還是吱吱喳地呌，直等到我立起身來，拿了什麼物件作打牠的姿勢時，牠纔迅捷地飛出去，站在孔廟的椽柱問又是吱吱喳喳的，像是訕笑，像是嘲諷。　　然而只要有人來談談，也可稍解稍解寂寞的。但，人呢？啊，「雁羣」原是在都市裏。此間儘有百靈烏，無奈不能和我飛成一個「一」字，飛成一個「人」字呵！我是一隻孤雁，的確離「羣」得太長久了，我要展一展翅膀向都市去找我的「雁羣」。出城  羅之華　　整個的小城陷進混亂的狀態里，城門緊緊地關閉着，只在中午時分開，一次，但是，在這開放的時間，對於行人的限制也非常嚴厲，——只准出，不准進，對於出城的人的檢查又是那樣地認眞。　　圍城很久了，敵人因戰略的關係，不再顧這城市，我們才能出去的。聽說檢查得那樣嚴，我就對母親說：「我們單身走吧！」　　街上好像冬天的野外外一樣，非常地冷淸。北國的靑色的天空，依然愉快地閃着光輝。一切都好像生澀多多了，對那黃葉子的槐樹，平板的石座，都好像見了依稀認識的友人一樣，充滿了回味的熱情。允其是年靑靑的妹妹，她被炮聲，鎗聲束緊的天眞的心展開了，跳着無决序的舞步在人羣前面走。她吵着母親，看着母費力的步伐，好像很難過似的，又用圓潤的嗓子問母親：　　「八里地得走多少時間呢？」　　母親急燥地支唔開她，回頭問我似的說：　　「不知道你舅舅來接不來接，……這遠的路！……」　　「誰知道呢？聽說還抓車。」　　走在這種冷淸的路上，自己雖然放慢了脚步，也還得走兩步，等等他們，不然，那是會把她們丟開的。母親和同來的幾位，就對我說：　　「你先同你妹妹頭里走吧，俺們後面趕！」　　携着妹妹的手，我們很快地轉到另條街上，回頭看她們，她們好像在議論着什麽，很緩慢地走着。　　這條街，離我們所要經過的西門已不遠了，所以行人也就不少，大家都帶着歡欣的心情走着談着，有的在詢問這些天的情况；有的就偷偷的而又用大聲的吵着誰家的姑娘被强姦了：還有些，就　嚓着許多瑣碎的新聞。更有些人，說他們到親戚家去住是多麼舒服。他們被火藥的空氣燻染了的心，得到一種淸新的味素。被絕望，死亡，籠罩着的神經又回復到原來的活躍。雖然，出城還有許多困難，也都滿不關心。你看他們的豐度吧，他們活了！　　我同妺妺用快的步，代穿過他們談論的隊伍，城門馬上頭現在眼前了。　　城門樓殘缺了東南角，城廂兩旁堆積着麻袋，木板，和其他部下的防御物。無秩序地擺在那里。路兩旁的店鋪還關着門，有一兩個閑人站在那里看熱閙。他們注意着這里的情景，像看一慕劇似的。　　我和妹妹站在一家店舖門口，等母親來。　　「你先在這兒，我看看檢查的嚴不嚴。……　　檢查的並不嚴，因為他們新接到命令說：明天再檢查，因為相信走出去的都是良民，等待明天准許進內的時候再說。因此，我們很快地就出來了。　　一出城，景像就又是一樣，在關廂的兩旁，站立着許多人，都是從西鄕趕來接親戚的。他們的焦燥的神氣，全浮現在臉上。眼睛盯着每一個走出來的人　　舅父看到我們的時候，歡喜得像小孩子似地過來抱起妹妹，顯出無限的親愛。母親更是喜悅。他問舅父許多話，舅父好像很疲倦了似的沒有多回答。　　街道被馬糞，馬尿，佔有了。脚一不小心就會弄汚了鞋子。在中午的太陽下，氣味濃原地擁向人的鼻管。許多孩子們在收拾馬糞，也有些孩子　　砲皮，遺留下的麥　桿草，破爛的衣服。　　舅舅領着我們走。　　太陽巳經偏西了。光綫已經弱些。　　出來關廂，野外的地上，凌亂地遺留着馬蹄的痕跡。　　我向舅舅說：人馬走的很慌嗎？」　　「聽說還來呢！就在這兩天」　　舅　充滿了微笑地，對着妹妹說。　　母親又被我們遺留在後邊了。播音節目歌曲介紹　　少爺家里眞富有，良田千頃地萬畝，吃的油，著的綢，心里永世不擔憂。出外有眼班，回家有丫頭，飯來開口筷來伸手；三餐魚肉還說不適口，服侍不週全，打罵不羆休；他說貧家兒女富家狗，你去我不留，扳着面孔向外走，跳舞場里逛逛，賭場里走走，堂正里跑跑，鴉片烟抽抽，胡調朋友，馬屁滴溜，引得少爺上了鈞；即使爹娘死，鴉片還是抽，月照西山神初醒，日上三竿夢里遊，家務休提起，人事少開口。他不管，禍難臨頭，火燒脚跟後，祗管着吱吱差差，差差吱吱，儘把鴉片抽！　　少爺從前衣綾羅，今朝貧困衣襤褸，鞋無跟，衣無袖，蓬頭垢臉誰招留？肚子沒得飽，鴉片沒得抽，東無路去，西無路走，挖空心思，轉出壞念頭，白天變化巧，晚上設法偷，，賊心虛寒身子瑟瑟抖，事機怕洩漏，回頭捉捉香烟頭，門樓下做窠，廢紙當被頭。一旦北風起，寒冷怎樣過？前情思量，苦自招受，悔不應該網自投！黑飯心着急，白飯更要愁，異想天開巧計籌；吿吿地狀磕磕頭，眼淚沾衣襟，鼻涕滿地流，這時候，長吁短嘆，橫臥沿街口，他如今臉黃肌瘦，皮包骨頭，活像一骷髏！歌唱　　夜鶯藝社　　富星（九二〇）下午二時至三時　　夜半的私語　（曼娜）　　花想容　（綠茵）　　戰地之花　（露茜）　　愛情是什麼　（流朗）　　關外高歌　（曼娜）　　姑娘你聽見嗎　（綠茵）　　一身都是愛　（露茜）　　良辰美景　（曼娜）　　大陸（八二〇）下午四時至四時三刻　　空中音樂　（國莉）　　漁村之歌　（國霞）　　城市之光　（國蓓）　　不能忘記你　（國雯）　　丁丁當太太　（國斌）（國莉）　　明梅團　　華美（一〇六〇）下午五時一刻至六時　　秋夜蕭聲　（純美）　　慢牛快馬　（莉玲）　　和尙離婚　（張素貞）　　關外高歌　（純美）　　山中美人　（莉玲）　　新小放牛　（張素貞）　　華美（一〇六〇）下午九時至十時　　大地行軍曲　（飛亞）　　我不能忘記你　（飛虹）　　鮮花新婚　（文仙）　　南海美人　（飛亞）　　我們的皇后　（飛虹）　　因為你太美　（文仙）　　城市之光　（飛亞）　　光明之路　（全體）美術　　毛執中美術講習座　　航業（一一八〇）下午五時半至六時一刻批評相對性（中）　失望與失　，對於素不相識的，初以不足注意，忽然受感點意外的刺激，就不免逾格傾倒。　阿好與避嫌。　雷同與立異。對於盛名人，不知覺從崇拜說好。彈詞　　夏荷生三笑　　敦本（八〇〇）下午七時至八時　　開篇　「春色」　　春回大地氣象新。拂拂和風陶醉人。你　那，桃花紅。紅　　。　　綠。　　　　更有　　碧波請，寒梅開放　將　　　　含苞　吐芬。</p>

The Japanese version of events is that at 10:30 PM on Sunday, after Chaoyangmen had been closed, a car carrying five Japanese soldiers and one officer arrived from Tongzhou and requested the gate guards to open the gate and let them in. The gate guards asked their superiors for permission and then opened the gate. As soon as the car entered the street, the Chinese soldiers opened fire, firing at least thirty rounds. Yesterday, Chinese and Japanese authorities negotiated this case but failed to reach an agreement.

<h3 id="e14">The Chahar-Northern Negotiation, Worthy of Great Attention <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The successive incidents in Eastern Hebei and Northern Chahar are manifestations of a planned and step-by-step northward-offensive and southward-defensive policy directed by a certain party. The reporter has already made some comments on this matter (see the current commentary in this newspaper on December 27 of last year). Now, after a lapse of ten days, the development of the situation has exceeded expectations. After the pseudo-army of Li Shouxin occupied the six counties of Guyuan, Kangbao, Baochang, Shangdu, Zhangbei, and Wanquan in Northern Chahar, it even attempted to intrude into eastern Suiyuan. The remnants of the bandit Liu Guitang, entrenched in Yanching in the Chahar territory, also took the opportunity to flee westward. As a result, the five counties of Fengzhen, Jining, Taolin, and Helingcheng in eastern Suiyuan felt the threat of the western invasion of the Northern Chahar pseudo-army and were quite alarmed. Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan Province, had no choice but to actively increase defenses in eastern Suiyuan. As for the diplomatic aspect, in addition to the central government's submission of negotiations to the Japanese side, Song Zheyuan and others have also recently negotiated with Tanaka Ryuichi, staff officer of the Japanese Kwantung Army, and have made several decisions. Recently, it was heard that a principle of resolution was roughly agreed upon on the 5th of this month. The content is: The five counties of Zhangbei and others will be jointly defended by the provincial security team and the Mongolian banner security team. The administration will still be directly under the jurisdiction of the Chahar provincial government. The pseudo-army of Li Shouxin will all withdraw to Doron. According to the Japanese side, the reason for insisting that the Mongolian banner security team enter the counties of Zhangbei and others is to prevent communism. However, if this negotiation becomes an established fact, then although the Chahar provincial authorities still possess the nominal integrity of the territory, half of the Chahar province will in fact be reduced to a co-managed area. The impact will not only be a serious threat to the entire Suiyuan Province, but also to the provinces of Ningxia, Shaanxi, Xinjiang, and Shanxi. The severity of its nature cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Japanese side's active westward work has been no less than its southward invasion. For example, the construction of the Doron airfield, the activities of the intelligence team, the anesthetization of Inner Mongolian youth, the training of the Mongolian banner security team, the seduction of Mongolian princes, and the coercion of local authorities are all worthy of deep attention. The Japanese side's intention is to use Doron as a center to control all of Chahar and Suiyuan, while simultaneously penetrating the northwestern provinces of China through the Chahar and Suiyuan provinces. When the Zhangbei dispute was being negotiated in July of last year, the Japanese side proposed demarcating the area of Doron, Guyuan, Dushikou, Chicheng, Yanching, and Huailai in eastern Chahar as a non-garrison area. This was a concrete manifestation of its active westward invasion, and it is regrettable that our side readily accepted it. Since then, the gateway of Chahar Province has been wide open, and the power of the invaders has been able to enter directly. This decision on the occurrence of the Northern Chahar incident is a consistent action. The so-called anti-communism is only a means to cover up its aggression.</p>
<p>Recently, the Northern Chahar negotiations have aroused the deep attention of foreigners, who believe that this is a major issue concerning the territorial integrity of China and the Russo-Japanese War. From the standpoint of the nation, we sincerely feel that the Northern Chahar incident is not a common local incident and must be dealt with carefully. Under this serious situation, what is hoped for from the North China authorities conducting the negotiations is: first, to carefully examine the relationship of interests and its future impact; second, to abandon nominal gains and value actual results and not delay and procrastinate due to the difficulty of the problem. Otherwise, the new situation that will arise after the Northern Chahar incident is resolved is not what we want to imagine.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Vice Chairman Chiang’s Report at the Memorial Week (Continued from Yesterday) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>"The Great Path of Revolution and Nation-Building as a Person"</p>
<p>Every thought, every word, and every action of ours must be rooted in good intentions, originate from sincerity, be cautious in solitude, and never deviate from decisions made. We must know that all things in the world are born from this sincerity and sustained by it. If a single thought is insincere, then all things become false, and everything returns to nothingness. As the saying goes, "Sincerity is the beginning and end of things; without sincerity, there is nothing." We must deeply understand this profound principle and practice it with caution and reverence at all times. Only then can we achieve rectitude of mind and sincerity of intention, and complete the work of self-cultivation. The most important thing in the work of "sincerity of intention" is to "accept good and hold fast to it." Therefore, before we can be sincere in our intentions, we must be able to clearly distinguish between what is good and evil in all things. For example, we must first firmly recognize and believe that the Three Principles of the People are the only perfect and flawless revolutionary ideology for saving the country and the world. Only then can we go through fire and water, sacrificing everything to realize the ideology. Conversely, if we cannot clearly understand that the Three Principles of the People are the perfect and flawless revolutionary ideology, we cannot firmly believe and practice them, and we will be afraid of danger and sacrifice everywhere. Therefore, it is said, "Those who wish to be sincere in their intentions must first extend their knowledge." The Premier's teachings to us in general about revolutionary spirit, which are also the teachings for our general revolutionary party members, first emphasize "the wisdom of a soldier": first, "distinguish right from wrong"; second, "understand advantages and disadvantages"; third, "recognize the times"; and fourth, "know oneself and the enemy." In addition, the Premier also said that the foundation of revolution lies in profound knowledge. These precious posthumous teachings are meant to encourage us to strive for knowledge. We must extend our knowledge, and then we can sincerely and wholeheartedly carry out the ideology and complete the revolution. As for the method of "extending knowledge," the principle behind it is explained most clearly by Cheng Zi. He said, "The so-called extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things, which means that to extend our knowledge, we must investigate things and exhaust their principles. For the human mind is inherently capable of knowing, and all things in the world have their principles. However, because the principles have not been exhausted, our knowledge is incomplete. Therefore, when the Great Learning begins its teachings, it must require students to investigate all things in the world, exhausting their principles based on the knowledge they already have, to seek the ultimate understanding. When they have exerted themselves for a long time, and suddenly one day they achieve a breakthrough and comprehensive understanding, then the external and internal, refined and coarse aspects of all things will be known, and the entirety and great function of our minds will be clear. This is called the investigation of things, and this is called the perfection of knowledge." When we read these words of his, we can understand that the so-called "extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things" means "investigating things and exhausting their principles." For example, today, when I came to the Central Party Headquarters, I could see many things that need to be improved along the way. To be a revolutionary—that is, to be a statesman—and to govern the affairs of the people and the country well, the most important fundamental cultivation is to pay attention, observe, and study all things at all times and in all places, especially all social phenomena. Otherwise, you will not know the affairs of society and the country at all, let alone talk about governing society and the country well and completing the revolution. Therefore, "the investigation of things" is the beginning of all our cultivation and undertakings. "When things are investigated, knowledge is extended; when knowledge is extended, intentions are made sincere; when intentions are made sincere, the heart is rectified; when the heart is rectified, the person is cultivated; when a person is cultivated, the family is regulated; when the family is regulated, the state will be rightly governed; when the state is rightly governed, the whole world will be at peace." The above are the eight steps of the Great Learning, among which the most important is self-cultivation, because self-cultivation is at the center of the eight steps, serving as the pivot that connects the beginning and end, the internal and external, and the key to the intertwining of mind and matter, and the integration of virtue and achievement. It is also the foundation of all personal cultivation and undertakings. Therefore, Confucius said, "From the Son of Heaven down to the common people, all must regard self-cultivation as the root. It has never been the case that when the root is in disorder, the branches can be well governed." The so-called "Son of Heaven" used to refer to the emperor. Now, we should extend its meaning to refer to "leaders." A family has a head, an army has an officer, a group has a leader, and a country has a head of state. From the highest head of state to the people of the whole country, all must regard self-cultivation as the root. If one cannot cultivate oneself, one cannot only not carry out the revolutionary cause of regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world, but also cannot be said to have achieved the goals of investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, and rectifying the heart. Therefore, if one cannot cultivate oneself, one cannot only not do things, but also cannot be a person at all. The content of the Great Learning lies in the three guiding principles of "manifesting illustrious virtue," "renovating the people," and "resting in the highest excellence," and the eight steps of "investigating things, extending knowledge, making intentions sincere, rectifying the heart, cultivating the person, regulating the family, governing the state, and bringing peace to the world." If we want to be a person, we must know the principles of being a person, which are found here. If we want to make a revolution, govern the country, and bring peace to the world, we must know the principles of making a revolution, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world, which are also found here. This refined, comprehensive, and consistent principle is not only a unique treasure in our Chinese political philosophy, but also the basic scientific methodology for being a person and conducting business. Therefore, I say that the Great Learning is entirely scientific and entirely a scientific university. If we act according to the principles of the Great Learning, we can succeed in any undertaking. If we do not act according to the principles of the Great Learning, not only will all our efforts be in vain, but we will certainly end in failure. In the past, our comrades did not lack effort in the revolution, and they were very willing to sacrifice themselves. But why has the revolution not succeeded even after fifty years, and why has the country been brought to such a critical state of crisis? We must sincerely reflect on this reason and thoroughly awaken to it. Otherwise, the country will be lost, and we will not even know why. If we can all reflect and awaken, and make timely efforts, and from now on, everyone works together with one heart and one mind, acting according to the principles of the revolution, we will still have time to save the country, and the revolution can certainly be completed. When I was eighteen years old, I had read the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean countless times, but I did not know the importance of the principles contained therein. I even thought that these antiquated things were completely useless because of the development of revolutionary thought. Later, when I was twenty-eight years old, I heard the Premier tell me the importance of the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean, but I still did not pay much attention to it. It was not until I was thirty-eight years old, when my own experiences and knowledge had increased, that I took this book out again to study, and I realized that it was truly important. Almost all the principles for being a person and conducting business are contained therein. Since then, I have read it at least once a year, and the more I read it, the more I feel that there are infinite principles and endless mysteries within it. Now that I am forty-eight years old, on the one hand, I have been constantly studying it, and on the other hand, I have been constantly reflecting on the reasons for the past failures of the revolution and repenting that I did not complete the revolution earlier according to the principles of the Great Learning. I deeply feel that I have gained something in my heart that I can be confident in. Therefore, today, in the first Premier Memorial Week of the new year, I am presenting these thoughts to all comrades early on. If I did not say it, I would be letting down the Premier and all comrades, and letting down my own conscience. Now that I have said it, I hope that all comrades will act according to these inherent, proper, and unchangeable principles of China. Otherwise, the revolution will not succeed, and the country will be lost. At that time, we will not have time to regret it, and we will truly be letting down the Premier, letting down the 400 million compatriots of the country, and letting down our ancestors of the past 5,000 years. Therefore, from now on, all comrades in our party must encourage each other and lead by example, following the Premier's posthumous teachings and acting according to these revolutionary principles. Only then can we be models for the people, be worthy disciples of the Premier, and enable our party's life to be renewed day by day, and complete the mission of saving the country and the people. All the principles for being a person, making a revolution, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world are contained herein. I hope everyone will strive to put them into practice, and I wish you all a healthy New Year. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>London - Today, the naval conference resumed after a recess. Foreign Secretary Eden was elected as chairman, replacing former Foreign Secretary Hoare. Members continued to discuss the UK's proposal for each nation to unilaterally declare the number of warships they plan to build within a certain number of years. The Japanese representative criticized this proposal, stating that it was tantamount to maintaining a proportional system and would not reduce armaments. The British chief representative, First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell, replied that the idea of proportionality need not be overemphasized, and that the British plan could achieve reductions based on qualitative guidelines. The French chief representative, Roubier, put forward a new proposal, advocating that all signatory countries, including Germany, should report the types and armaments of all warships they plan to build to the League of Nations for dissemination to all countries six months in advance. He also advocated reducing the size of battleships and cruisers. The Italian delegation's spokesman put forward a similar proposal to Roubier's, advocating reporting shipbuilding programs annually as a general procedure, rather than the actual construction emphasized in the French plan. The US chief representative, Davis, spoke next, offering a general critique of the British, French, and Italian proposals. When the French representative Roubier mentioned that some countries might advocate a six-year period, Davis stated that any decided timeframe must be universally applied to all countries. He also stated that the work of the previous month's meeting was to consolidate the three proposals into one, or to select one of the three as a mechanism for seeking qualitative restrictions. The meeting was then adjourned to Wednesday to allow representatives to discuss the details of each proposal. Judging from the situation at today's meeting, the hope of reaching a qualitative restriction agreement has virtually disappeared. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>London - After a sixteen-day recess, the naval conference resumed this afternoon. Before the recess, the UK had put forward a plan for quantitative restrictions (advocating that naval powers notify each other of their shipbuilding programs within a certain number of years, roughly set at six years). This proposal has failed. This is the most noteworthy event of today's meeting. France proposed that naval powers notify each other of their shipbuilding programs within a shorter period, which has been accepted by the UK for discussion. It is generally believed that the UK's purpose is to prolong the discussion of quantitative restrictions so that the naval conference does not completely fail due to Japan's opposition to the British plan.

<h3 id="e50">French Representative's New Proposal: Advocates Annual Notification of Shipbuilding Plans <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>London - The First Committee of the Disarmament Conference held its first meeting of the year at Clarence House at 3:16 PM. The Japanese delegation, including plenipotentiaries Nagano and Nagai, Rear Admiral Iwashita, Captain Inagaki, secretaries Fukumoto, Yamagata, and Terasaki, and official Inoue, attended. The US was represented by plenipotentiary Davis and Secretary Stanley. The UK was represented by First Lord of the Admiralty Monsell and Secretary Chatterfee, Councilor Craigie, etc. After Monsell announced the opening of the meeting, he proposed electing new Foreign Secretary Eden as chairman of the conference, which was unanimously approved. Next, discussion began on the British government's proposed shipbuilding declaration. French representative Vice Admiral Roubier spoke first, stating that pre-determining a long-term six-year shipbuilding plan would not be able to cope with changes in the international situation, and that the French government absolutely could not agree to a shipbuilding plan based on the current ratio. Therefore, the French representative presented the French government's shipbuilding notification proposal, the content of which is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The signatory governments shall annually report their shipbuilding plans to all countries of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Shipbuilding plans shall be decided independently by each government.</p>
<p>The participation of the German government in this notification proposal is a necessary condition. The French representative also mentioned qualitative restrictions and advocated reducing the size of battleships and cruisers. The US representative did not present any specific proposals. (Domei, 6th)</p>
<p>London - The General Committee of the Naval Conference continued its meeting at Clarence House this afternoon. Prior to the meeting, a certain French representative, at the urging of the UK, visited Fujii, an expert of the Japanese delegation, to inquire about Japan's attitude towards the British proposal. It was determined that Japan's opposition was firm and irreversible. According to recent news, the Japanese delegation had received instructions from the government during the recess to reject the British plan and any other proposals that did not grant Japan equal rights. After the General Committee meeting began, the British representative spoke first, defending his country's proposal. After a short debate, he accepted the French proposal for discussion. The French representative then explained his country's proposal, stating that a long-term quantitative restriction agreement was no longer possible because it would require establishing a permanent ratio of naval power for each country. Therefore, the naval conference should now seek to establish an agreement in which naval powers exchange information on their shipbuilding programs within a short period of time to understand each other's intentions. Since the financial capabilities of each country are different, this approach is actually sufficient to achieve the goal of restriction. Moreover, since the timeframe is short, each country can make modifications as needed to adapt to changes in the international situation. This is the advantage of the French proposal, he said. The Italian representative advocated a one-year limit for the exchange of shipbuilding information, as the budgets of each country are also based on one-year periods. The US representative said that the French proposal was worthy of consideration, but the Japanese representative adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The General Committee then adjourned. Tomorrow, France, the UK, and Italy will submit concrete proposals based on various data for each delegation to study, so that they can be submitted for discussion at the General Committee meeting on Wednesday. It is generally believed that if the French proposal is adopted, the shipbuilding programs of each naval power will be subject to the limitations of their national budget capabilities, and Japan will definitely express strong opposition. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - In order to cope with the breakdown of the Naval Conference, British Foreign Secretary Eden plans to divert the situation with a British-Japanese agreement on China. This has been reported repeatedly by two or three foreign dispatches. Japanese foreign affairs authorities attach great importance to this news, because the formal meeting to be continued is still in progress, and the appearance of the word "breakdown" is a cause for great concern. No matter what happens at the Naval Conference, it is limited to discussing naval disarmament issues. If political issues are added, it will be rejected, as this is the fundamental policy that has always been adhered to. Therefore, the following views are expressed:</p>
<p>Since the preliminary naval conference, the British government has hoped to conclude a British-Japanese agreement on China, solely for the purpose of ensuring British interests in China. However, the Japanese government has decided to avoid delving into this issue because the agenda of the naval conference has long been limited. In particular, the Japanese side believes that the true intention of the British government to limit the British-Japanese agreement to China is not its intention. The area most desired for agreement in British-Japanese commerce and trade is not China, but British territories outside of China. (Domei News Agency, 7th)</p>

<p>London - The UK has suddenly changed its plans today to increase its military strength in the Philippines. While re-discussing the implementation of the oil embargo against Italy, it is scheduling ships to transport troops to the Mediterranean. The steamer Siesia has now been ordered to stop its Pacific service and will probably carry troops and guns to Alexandria on January 8.

<p>Rome - General Badoglio, High Commissioner of East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, issued a communique today stating, "The northern and southern front lines are calm and uneventful today." (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Italian Somaliland Front Line - The long-awaited Italian general offensive has been launched on the southern front. It was learned here today that the Italian army has launched an offensive in the densely forested Ganoduri Basin. The basin is located between Dolo and Merca and is about thirty-five miles long. There are currently no Ar army traces. According to late news received here, the Italian army occupied Alili Village on January 2 after two days of fierce fighting. In this battle, 150 Ar army were killed and many were injured. The Italian army reported two white people and two Asgari native soldiers killed, and five people injured. (Guomin, 6th)</p>
<p>Tai Xi City, A Country - Our special correspondent La Fuyate reports that Italian planes recently dropped poisonous gas bombs in the Tangbian area, which spread white smoke upon landing. There has been torrential rain here in the past few days, making the roads to the capital difficult to travel. Military personnel believe that this is extremely beneficial to the Ar army because: First, this year is expected to be a three-decisive harvest, and food supplies will definitely be sufficient. Second, the muddy roads are enough to prevent the mechanized Italian army from advancing. The Ar army's military operations are not affected by the weather or terrain, and the necessary food can also be transported by camel for supply. Several American newspaper visitors originally planned to take cargo cars to the Ar capital, but abandoned their cars and walked because the muddy roads prevented them from passing through the mountains.

(Guomin, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome - Regarding the front-line battles in Somaliland, the newspapers recently received news that the Italian army had occupied Ar country's Alili area. On New Year's Day, the Italian army commander of Dolo City ordered his troops to quickly reconnoiter the area within 60 kilometers of the city. A small team of indigenous troops encountered the Ar army in battle. Fifteen Ar army and one Italian Tuba commando were killed. The next day, a large number of Tuba commandos set off again in armored vehicles. About 500 Ar army resisted with machine guns. Although the Tuba commandos charged with bayonets, they were still unable to succeed. After several hours of fierce fighting, a team of Asgari tribal native soldiers patrolling on the other side of the Ganarduia River crossed the river to join the battle. Finally, together with the Tuba commandos, they occupied the Ar army's position, destroyed it, and then returned to their original defense. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Economic Review <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Tang Qingzeng</p>
<p>Living Standards and Living Expenses—Zhao Ren</p>
<p>Things needed according to individual abilities and habits are called living standards, and the expenditure to maintain this standard is called living expenses.</p>
<p>Living standards are the things that each person needs at the current time and place. There are many other things that have not yet satisfied desires, so living standards can be raised and expanded at any time and place according to the promotion of each person's ability. From an individual point of view, the expansion of the need for things is the result of individual effort. From the perspective of the whole, the driving force of social progress is based on individual efforts to satisfy the needs of things beyond the current living standards. In the past history and current society, the operation and competition of people from all walks of life, whether their methods are proper or not, are all dissatisfied with the current living standards and hope to enjoy things that have never been enjoyed before. From an economic point of view, the disputes and separations between countries are nothing more than a symbol of striving to improve the general living standards of their own countries and expand the needs of things.</p>
<p>However, within a certain period and a certain region, the things included in the living standards have obvious differences in fineness, roughness, beauty, ugliness, quantity, and quality. The elements that determine it are three points. One is social class. The definition of the word "class" has always been very general. There are common divisions into upper, middle, and lower classes, into rich and poor classes, into labor and capital classes, and into mental and manual labor classes, etc. Although the meanings are very different, the main idea implicitly contains the difference between high and low, which is actually inappropriate. We believe that since the word "class" has been used for a long time and is not convenient to abandon, it should be distinguished in the economic dictionary exclusively according to occupation. Because of different occupations and the different environments in which they are located due to their occupations, the things needed are also different. For example, the clerk in the bank, the foreman in the factory, and the middle school teacher have roughly the same income. However, the bank clerk must take looking good and being able to socialize as the norm, so clothing must be paid special attention to. The needs of middle school teachers are in books. The foreman's short clothes and trousers are not different, and what he needs is somewhere else. It is not only because of his occupation that he is forced to do so, but his environment changes with his occupation, and he is transformed imperceptibly. Second is income. The more income, the wider the horizons and the greater the desires. Food and drink cannot be increased sharply, but the quality must be more refined than before. Other things that are not currently included in the living standards must be gradually introduced. When income shrinks, the things that are quietly consumed, regardless of quality or quantity, must be reduced. Third is the progress of material civilization. What was previously unavailable is now available. What was previously unattainable is now available for purchase at a lower price due to the mass production of machinery and the convenience of land and water transportation. Today's Western-style houses are far more comfortable than the tall and cold palaces. How many families could afford cars twenty years ago or telephones thirty years ago? How could you dream of electric lights and telephones in inland cities ten years ago? Now, although they are not popular, they should not be surprised as a strange story. Therefore, the so-called living standards are not only changing in quantity and quality, but also the things included in it are constantly changing and alternating.</p>
<p>Then, are there differences between high and low in living standards, as commonly said? We believe that the word "high," whether interpreted as noble or noble, is inappropriate. Those who live in Western-style houses, go out in cars, and need servants for all their actions can be said to be noble. Sitting quietly in a humble room, eating vegetables and wearing cloth clothes, not asking about honor or disgrace, and not fighting with the world, can be said to be noble. However, we only recognize the former as luxury and the latter as quirky, as personal peculiarities. What is most likely to affect the future of a country is the lowest living standard and the appropriate living standard. The so-called lowest living standard must include food, clothing, and housing, so that they have the lowest quantity and quality to maintain their survival and work efficiency. In addition to proper nutrition, warmth, and daily life, an appropriate living standard must have other things, such as education, books, and good social and entertainment, to stimulate intellectual, physical, and cultural contributions. If the low living standards cannot be maintained, the children and grandchildren will be weak and dull, and if they die unfortunately, the population will decrease. If appropriate living standards cannot be maintained, they will either flow into arrogance, luxury, and debauchery, or they will lose themselves in ignorance and hardship. Neither is a way to improve the nation.</p>
<p>In addition, after the living standard is determined by the individual and its environment, the force to continue to maintain or further expand the previous living standard can affect the increase or decrease of the population. The standards we are talking about are not only for individuals but also include family members who are supported by them. Marriage and childbirth are natural principles, but the education of children takes time, and the increase in individual income is limited. Even if the individual can maintain the previous living standard, or even expand it greatly, it is difficult to guarantee that their children and grandchildren can maintain the current standard and not fall into disgrace. Therefore, those with a little foresight are either worried about their own old age or worried that their children and grandchildren will fall into poverty and lowliness, and they will control childbirth in advance. The titles and properties of British aristocrats are only passed on to the eldest son, the old custom in China is that the eldest son occupies a larger share of the inheritance, and the universal late marriage and birth control in France, although in different ways, are intended to maintain a certain living standard throughout the generations. The impact on the population is most evident in France, which has been stagnant at around 40 million people for a long time. On the contrary, in China in recent decades, due to domestic and foreign political and economic turmoil, social income has obviously shrunk, but the population has continued to increase as in the past. Therefore, the general living standards have to continue to fall for a long time. The life of ordinary farmers today is actually on the verge of or has fallen below the starvation line. This is well known and is the reason why the talk of rural relief is so prevalent.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Roosevelt's Message to Congress: New Budget Revenues and Expenditures Do Not Offset, Agricultural Adjustment Act Ineffective, Tax Revenue Greatly Reduced, Silver Coinage Tax Reflects Future Silver Purchase Policy <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Expansion of the Air Force Requires Expenditures of 80 Million</p>
<p>Washington - Roosevelt's 1937 budget was already unable to offset revenues and expenditures before it was submitted to Congress. After the Agricultural Adjustment Act became ineffective, the President's original estimate of $547,000,000 in business tax revenue was no longer based on anything. Even the $529,000,000 included in the 1936 budget only collected $64,000,000. (Guomin, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - The government is about to submit the 1937 budget, in which, regarding the air force, the government proposes to build 884 warplanes with an expenditure of 58 million US dollars, of which 507 are for the army and 377 are for the navy. It is generally believed that part of these planes are to replace old planes, so the total number of US military planes in 1937 will not increase much compared to the past. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt's budget message to Congress today stated that the government predicts that the Treasury's silver coinage tax in the 1937 fiscal year will be sharply reduced compared to this year. Experts here therefore speculate that the US Treasury will purchase less silver than before, and that the silver price paid will be lower than the average price this year. According to the President's estimate, the Treasury's coinage tax is sufficient to reflect the amount of silver purchased under the Silver Purchase Act and the Silver Nationalization Act. In 1937, it will only increase by $600,000,000, compared to $161,088,000 this year and $140,110,000 last year. According to the budget estimate, $370,000,000 in coinage tax will be available by the end of 1937, compared to $310,000,000 by the end of 1936. The coinage tax paid for most of the new metal ore being silver will yield $19,000,000, compared to an estimated $20,000,000 this year and $58,000,000 in 1934. (Guomin, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Opposition Faction Greatly Rejoices Upon Hearing the News <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Washington - The Republican Party and the New Deal opposition faction were very satisfied with the Supreme Court's recent ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act violated the Constitution, believing that the Roosevelt government had suffered another fierce blow. It is generally believed that various laws related to the Agricultural Adjustment Act, such as the Bankhead Cotton Act, the Smith Tobacco Act, and the Warren Potato Act, will be declared invalid by the Supreme Court next week. According to observations from some people, President Roosevelt had previously considered proposing an amendment to the current Constitution when the Supreme Court declared that the regulations of the Economic Recovery Bureau violated the Constitution (in June last year), but then gave up. Now that the Agricultural Adjustment Act has been declared invalid, it will inevitably be brought up again and require major amendments. Even the message that the President read to Congress yesterday stated that the "privileges" enjoyed by Congress can be protected by devising a way. This statement was aimed at the Supreme Court. In addition, government spokespersons have recently repeatedly declared that the American people are free to amend the national fundamental law if they wish to do so, indicating the President's intention to request an amendment to the Constitution. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Authorities Discuss Remedial Measures <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Washington - President Luo declined to criticize the Supreme Court's verdict and is currently discussing it with Agriculture Secretary Wallace and Attorney General Cummings. It is widely expected that President Luo will use financial assistance to persuade the states to adopt their own laws to replace the current law that has been ruled invalid in order to achieve the original purpose of supporting rural villages. After hearing the verdict of the Supreme Court, General Johnson, the initial administrative commissioner of the new measures, said that if the court ruled that all methods of the US government to relieve rural areas were illegal, the authorities would have no other choice but to fight on the constitutional issue. According to government sources, the income of American farmers in 1935 increased by 110 million yuan, which was due to the Agricultural Adjustment Act. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - After the Supreme Court announced its verdict that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was invalid, there was much speculation about President Luo's upcoming movement, but it was widely expected that the authorities were well prepared and could act immediately. However, judging from the phenomenon, there may not be any action immediately. Although President Luo did not express his opinion on this verdict, he will consult with the leaders of the government on everything, and there may be a concrete announcement in three or four days. It is reported that the government owes farmers 500 million yuan in subsidies in accordance with existing contracts. Government lawyers say that this expenditure must be paid regardless of the fate of the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It is reported that President Luo and his staff have now planned to request the allocation of funds to pay off the funds that farmers should receive under the existing Agricultural Adjustment Act contract up to the date of the court's verdict.</p>
<p>At the same time, political observers are now quite doubtful about the fate of the Social Security Act, the Guffey Coal Act, and the Wagner Labor Disputes Act, etc., because these bills are all based on Congress's unlimited authority. Agriculture Secretary Wallace and his staff are all in their offices studying the extent to which the Agricultural Adjustment Act has been irreparably destroyed. Republican Senator McNani is currently planning a new rural bill, the main purpose of which is to restore the subsidy method for agricultural product exports. At the same time, several members of parliament advocate amending the Constitution. Business people, in view of today's verdict of the Supreme Court, believe that the Peng Head case and the Tobacco case being ruled invalid is expected, and cotton merchants are now extremely anxious about the handling of the cotton stored by the US Cotton Reserve Agency after the Peng Head case is ruled invalid in the future. Agriculture Secretary Wallace and Agricultural Adjustment Bureau Director Davis are prepared to immediately submit a new bill to Congress. It is reported that the authorities plan to provide central assistance to the states so that each state can establish its Agricultural Adjustment Act and achieve its original purpose. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Impact on the Future Presidential Election <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Some members of Congress today predicted that this session of Congress will be extended to Christmas this year due to the Supreme Court's ruling that the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA) is unconstitutional, pending the conclusion of the presidential election. Many supporters of the New Deal measures said that most of the New Deal policies have lost their vitality. The new Social Security Act, which provides for unemployment insurance, old-age pensions, and work relief programs, will also be ruled invalid for the same reasons. Politics is now in great chaos. Funding for assisting farmers in limiting production, totaling 113 million yuan, ceased flowing last night, and office staff will therefore be laid off. Officials at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) have not yet commented on this situation, but it is rumored that the AAA is now considering the following three temporary alternative measures:</p>
<p>* Domestic distribution program that insures prices for farmers based on the amount of production.</p>
<p>* Establishing 48 small-scale state AAAs under central coordination.</p>
<p>* Providing subsidies to farmers who properly use their land.</p>
<p>Political leaders generally say that the Supreme Court's decision will have a significant impact on the presidential election campaign. Even if Congress can levy new taxes to meet the current expenses of agricultural production restriction contracts, Congress is very reluctant to do so in light of future elections. Those who generally welcome the Supreme Court's decision are now unusually silent, because the issue of rural relief is extremely important, and farmers' votes are considered extremely important by both the Republican and Democratic parties. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">The Constitution Needs Amendment More Than Ever <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Washington - After the Supreme Court's ruling, Agriculture Secretary Wallace immediately held a closed-door meeting with his staff, and then announced the cessation of collecting donations based on the AAA. According to opinions from Congress, if the government wants to preserve the social order created by President Roosevelt and prevent its complete demise, it will have to use amending the Constitution as a tool for competitive elections. Many Democratic members believe that the repeated blows to the agricultural and industrial sectors from the Supreme Court's rulings on the New Deal measures will inevitably lead to increased anxiety. American Federation of Labor President Green stated that the Constitution now needs amendment more than ever. The Supreme Court's decision has made the agricultural and industrial sectors aware of the difficulties under the limitations of the Constitution. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>New York - After the Supreme Court's decision on the AAA was announced, the national securities and commodities exchanges were in great turmoil. Initially, there was a frenzied buying of cotton and wheat, but then, in a sudden change of heart, people sold them off one after another, and the market situation was very chaotic. Wheat initially rose by two points, and cotton rose by more than one yuan per bale, but before long, most of the gains were lost. Grain stocks on the New York Stock Exchange initially rose by one to three pounds, but sales of farm equipment and commodity stocks soon rose, fearing that rural purchasing power would be weakened by the decision. The majority opinion of Wall Street merchants is that the government will soon propose new legislation to prevent rural purchasing power from being greatly affected. At the same time, merchants of gold, silver, food, and cotton textiles welcomed the Supreme Court's decision, believing that prices could be reduced and consumption increased as a result. Wall Street insiders predict that the recovery movement will not suffer a major setback as a result of this, because the people will be able to quickly adapt to their environment.

<p>Washington - A local authority on Far Eastern trade issues predicted today that the Supreme Court's blow to the U.S. agricultural control program may increase U.S. cotton, wheat, and tobacco exports to Eastern countries. This increase in exports is due to the reduction in costs after the abolition of the processing tax, which allows Far Eastern importers to obtain cheap goods. Experts claim that there has been a substantial decrease in U.S. exports of cotton, wheat, and tobacco to China and Japan from 1932, when production was unrestricted, to 1935, when agricultural production was controlled and processing taxes were levied. However, officials indicated that prices could have fallen more quickly, but this was due to the accumulation of large stockpiles three years ago, which were largely consumed during the control period. The United States has abundant production capacity and will soon be able to produce large quantities of food, but only if the government finds a way to limit its output can this be prevented. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Philippine Commerce Not Expected to be Affected <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Washington - Responsible businessmen in the Philippines declared today that the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that the AAA is invalid will not harm the Philippines. On the contrary, after the situation calms down, it may generate commercial benefits. It is generally believed that the authorities should quickly correct the chaos in the situation. As a result of this chaos, the current procedures may be shelved because they favor Cuba more than the Philippines. The question now is whether we will restore the tariff on sugar that existed before the establishment of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration after the processing tax is ruled illegal, because this tariff had been reduced in order to offset the processing tax. Responsible parties believe that the Supreme Court's decision will not hinder the transfer of coconut oil tax revenues to the Philippine government, because the basis for this tax is a tax law rather than the AAA. However, the issue of collecting this tax is currently under review by the Colombian Supreme Court. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e66">Ceylon, a Sacred Buddhist Land <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>On November 20th, 1935, the reporter took advantage of a study tour to Europe and visited Ceylon for half a day. This place is a sacred Buddhist land, anciently known as the Lion Kingdom. There are many historical sites and cultural relics worth recording. Here's my account:</p>
<p>Ceylon is an island southeast of the Indian peninsula, separated from the mainland by a strait. Many coral islands are scattered in the strait like a bridge, called Adam's Bridge. Its location is 81 degrees east longitude and 7.5 degrees north latitude, in the tropics. The climate is very hot, with no so-called seasons. The population is more than 5,303,000, mostly brown-skinned, of Indo-European descent. It is now a directly administered British colony. The capital, Colombo, is on the southwest coast of the island, a key point on the Europe-Asia sea route. Important products of the island, such as rubber, coconuts, tea, ebony, and graphite, are all exported from here. The old capital, Kandy, is in the mountains in the center of the island, 72 miles from Colombo. There are many ancient temples and famous sites. Legend has it that Sakyamuni once came here to preach. There is a Bodhi tree, which is a branch from the first sacred tree in India (Sakyamuni attained enlightenment under the tree, hence it is called Bodhi. Bodhi is a Sanskrit word meaning enlightenment). The original tree in India is now gone. This old trunk, more than two thousand years old, still stands majestically. There is also a Buddha tooth, kept in the Buddha hall, said to have been left by Sakyamuni.</p>
<p>Because the reporter was on the same ship with the Ceylonese High Monk Narada (Hikkbu Narada), he disembarked in Colombo for a visit. He was introduced by him to a local benefactor named JR. Jayawerdena, who took care of everything. We first went to the Buddhist Library, then visited several Buddhist temples, decided to tour the city streets, and finally had lunch at Jayawerdena's house. After the meal, because Mr. Jayawerdena had other business, we sat and chatted briefly and parted happily.</p>
<p>The Buddhist Library is located in Vajirarama, Bambalapitiya. There is a master in charge, about fifty years old. His Dharma name seems to be Sasada. The collection is limited to Buddhism and Buddhist studies. There are thousands of books, mostly in Sanskrit and English. The resident monks are mostly able to devote themselves to research. Master Narada has written many books. One of his Buddhist studies has a translated version in the Shanghai Buddhist Pure Land Society. Master Narada decided to travel east this time, traversing China, Japan, Singapore, Java and other places. His main purpose was to escort a branch of the Bodhi sacred tree of Ceylon to China for transplantation, so as to promote Buddhism. He also inspected the current state of Buddhism in the East. He was well received by fellow Buddhists in Shanghai. He was presented with many farewell poems.</p>
<p>In Ceylonese customs, one must put one's palms together and kneel down to pay respect to the Dharma Master. One must take off shoes and hats outside the door before entering the temple. One must offer freshly picked fragrant flowers when worshiping the Tathagata. One must not pick fresh leaves when admiring the Bodhi sacred tree. The reporter went to several temples to pay respects and followed the customs meticulously. As a result, I was able to see the sacred sites and feel very fortunate. What I saw and heard in the Buddha hall was very different from what I've seen in China:</p>
<p>* The construction of the hall is octagonal. There are no pavilions or lofts. Only concentric octagonal layers, painted and sculpted with Buddha statues. The scale is small, lacking the majestic style represented by our Lingyin Buddha Hall.</p>
<p>* The Tathagata Buddha statues are as beautiful as women, and the ears have traces of earrings. The ears are elongated, and the holes are also elongated.</p>
<p>* The Tathagata Buddha is the center of faith. There are no statues of Maitreya, Arhats, Avalokiteśvara, Skanda, Manjushri, Samantabhadra, etc.</p>
<p>* There are many murals, all oil paintings. The paintings depict the life and miracles of the Tathagata Buddha, lifelike. The statues also represent the Buddha's preaching and miraculous deeds. The figures are realistic, and the back and sides of the statues are painted on the walls, making them even more vivid. The statues and paintings all have a Western European style.</p>
<p>* Fresh flowers are offered, clean and tidy, with no turbid smell of incense, candles, or paper money.</p>
<p>* There is only a giant bell, but no wooden fish, chimes, drums, or other noisy instruments.</p>
<p>* One must take off shoes and hats outside the door before entering the temple.</p>
<p>* Lectures on the scriptures are open to the public and anyone can listen.</p>
<p>* There are many Westerners who believe in Buddhism. There are Buddhist halls built by Westerners (one named D. Ddward H. Pedris, who was a government official and a Buddhist, was murdered on July 7, 1915. His parents specially built a grand Buddhist temple area, including a Buddha hall, lecture hall, pagoda, dining hall, monks' quarters, sacred tree, etc. There are many marble offering tables donated by other Westerners in the hall). Most of those who come to worship are Westerners.</p>
<p>There are only two or three points that are the same as in China:</p>
<p>* Palms together and kneeling.</p>
<p>* There are also monks in the empty door who do not abide by the rules and secretly eat meat.</p>
<p>* Bald head wearing a cassock (actually just a piece of cloth wrapped around the body), with no burn marks on the head.</p>
<p>Sakyamuni Buddha was born in 623 BC, a prince of the Kapilavastu Kingdom of Central India. His clan was Sakyan, his name was Siddhartha Gautama. At the age of sixteen, he married Princess Yasidhara and lived in peace and prosperity for thirteen years. At the age of twenty-nine, he began to practice asceticism for six years. One day, he sat under the Bodhi tree and suddenly had an epiphany, thus attaining Nirvana. However, although Buddhism originated in India, it is not prevalent in India today. On the contrary, it occupies a considerable influence in Ceylon, Myanmar, China, and Japan. Is it not true that what is lost in the rites is sought in the wilderness?</p>
<p>The streets of Ceylon are very clean. There are coconut palms and small landscaped trees with many spotted leaves along the roadside. The residences are extremely small and exquisite, and every house must have a garden. Mr. Jayawerdena's residence is excellent. In our eyes, it can be called a cool villa. Although the house is only one story high, the layout is well-organized and the furnishings are beautiful. Mr. Jayawerdena lives with his mother, wife, brother, and sister. They are all respectful and polite to guests, as they have all received secondary education. Before the meal, Mr. Jayawerdena first offered me lemonade and coconut water, and gave me a few Bodhi leaves and a copy of "The Life of Buddha" (written by Master Narada and published by Mr. Jayawerdena). During the meal, I tried the local Ceylonese flavor. Both meat and vegetarian dishes are added with curry. Using my fingers instead of knives and forks, I put the rice and dishes into my mouth. It was quite interesting to return to simplicity. After the meal, I ate papaya and fragrant bananas and drank double-steamed water from a clay pot (the method is to put boiled water in a clay pot and wait for it to cool, then boil it again in the pot, so it is rich in earthy and smoky flavors. It would be impolite to refuse, so I had to frown and swallow it). After this meal of exotic flavors, I said goodbye.</p>
<p>Ceylonese men's clothing: a cotton yarn shirt on the upper body, a skirt on the lower body, and bare feet. Some are naked with a triangular cloth. The middle and upper classes mostly wear Western suits. Women wear only a halter-style short shirt on the upper body, with wide shoulders, bare arms, and high breasts exposed outside the clothing, with a rich curvy beauty. The lower body is a colored skirt and bare feet. The clogs or slippers are a combination of Chinese and Japanese styles. The middle and upper classes who wear Western clothing have the same trends as men.</p>
<p>The Ceylon municipal administration is good. Under the British government's management, the construction is also quite remarkable. As for the administration, they used to treat the natives harshly, but now, due to the influence of Gandhi's efforts in India, it is more relaxed than before. There are not many Chinese businessmen here. They are mostly silk merchants. The Ceylonese currency, the rupee, is approximately equal in value to the Chinese currency at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>The Italian ship Conte Rosso also arrived the day before the reporter arrived in Ceylon. Because the League of Nations implemented economic sanctions, there were many difficulties in renting boats, inspecting goods, and restricting the purchase of oil. It is said that they were quite embarrassed for a while. (Xu Zhenchi from Suez, December 1, 1935)</p>

<h3 id="e67">U.S. AAA Ruled Unconstitutional <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Agricultural Controls Also Completely Overturned</p>
<p>Another Blow to Roosevelt's New Deal</p>
<p>Washington - The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled the AAA, on which the entire agricultural program of the New Deal was based, unconstitutional. The law has failed following the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA), marking one of the most important pages in American judicial history. The appellant was Hoosac Mills Corporation, which claimed that the processing tax on cotton products was unconstitutional. Only three of the nine Supreme Court justices, those known as liberals, dissented. The majority opinion was led by Chief Justice Hughes and Justice Van Devanter, among six others. Justice Roberts, who usually holds liberal views, surprisingly read the majority opinion today, stating that controlling agricultural production, even through voluntary agreements and with government subsidies, is ultimately unconstitutional. The court said that this plan uses the federal government's funds to "purchase the obedience of the people." Roberts also said that if this theory can be maintained, then the government can use its power to tax to any state and redistribute the local industry population. Roberts also mentioned the Bankhead Cotton Control Act, which is awaiting judgment, saying that the law has more enforcement power than the AAA. Now that the AAA has been ruled invalid, all processing taxes on agricultural products such as wheat, rice, tobacco, sugar, and paper, and the entire system of agricultural control, have become illegal. In addition to the Hoosac case, there are 1,356 other cases nationwide where cotton and wheat mills are attacking processing taxes in local courts. The general opinion here is that the Supreme Court's decision is more serious for President Roosevelt's recovery program than the overturning of the NIRA, because after the ruling, the government cannot collect processing taxes on basic commodities, and its debts of millions of dollars to farmers will be impossible to pay off, and the AAA will have to be dissolved like the NIRA. After the judgment was announced, the White House said that the president had no comment for the time being. Observers said that the wording of the decision was very firm and it would be difficult for the government to find another alternative. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - The AAA, promulgated by the government on May 12 last year, has recently been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. The verdict states, "This law endangers the rights of each state." According to the Constitution, although the government may collect taxes to promote the general welfare of citizens, it has no right to use special means to assist agriculture. The verdict also states that the court's task is to judge whether the government is executing the law according to law, and not to question whether the law is wise. It said, "If voters think that a certain law is not very good, they can advocate its abolition." Regarding the agricultural problem, Congress allowed the government to collect agricultural product processing taxes in order to "achieve an illegal and unconstitutional purpose," which is a means to "use federal public funds" to win over farmers and make them comply with federal law. In fact, this kind of problem belongs to the legislative scope of each state, not to be handled by the federal government. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - The AAA was promulgated on May 12 of last year. Its purpose was to allow the government to help farmers during agricultural panics, thereby increasing their purchasing power. On the one hand, it also supplemented the relief fund so that it could cope with all difficulties during economic changes. The specific method was for the government to establish the AAA to limit the planting area of various agricultural products. All farmers who reduced their production were given subsidies. Since the establishment of the AAA last May, the subsidies and relief funds allocated to farmers have reached 100 million U.S. dollars. Processing taxes on agricultural products are levied on farmers receiving subsidies in order to compensate for part of the expenditure. Although farmers and the AAA have signed contracts to accept production restriction measures, they have mostly expressed opposition to the processing tax and have filed lawsuits in court, claiming that what the government is doing violates the Constitution. As of last July, there have been more than 160 such cases. The Boston Court of Appeals once ruled that this tax was unconstitutional. At that time, in addition to appealing to the Supreme Court, the government also sent Senator La Follette to Congress to propose an amendment to the AAA, advocating that the power of the Minister of Agriculture to control the production and distribution of agricultural products be expanded in order to prevent the people from accusing the government of violating the Constitution again. This amendment was passed separately by the House and Senate, but the Supreme Court recently ruled that the AAA violates the Constitution, so the processing tax, which the AAA relies on as its only source, must be abolished. As for the contracts signed by the AAA with farmers to restrict production, the subsidies that should be paid to the farmers must still be paid, and the government only needs to find new sources of funding to cope with it. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - Since the Supreme Court ruled that the AAA is unconstitutional, the AAA has recently stopped collecting processing taxes on agricultural products and has temporarily stopped paying subsidies to farmers. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington - Observers claimed today that after the Supreme Court ruled the AAA invalid, the Bankhead Cotton Control Act and the Kerr Tobacco Control Act, among other agricultural control bills, have been completely overturned. However, the government has signed various agricultural control contracts with farmers across the country, and must pay subsidies of 60.2 million U.S. dollars. Now that the processing tax cannot be collected, other taxes must be raised to pay off this debt. (National Telegram, 6th)</p>

<p>Addis Ababa - Our correspondent, O'Chana, reports that the name of the new American advisor recently hired by the Abyssinian Emperor, which had been kept secret, has now been announced. He is named Spencer and arrived here from French Djibouti last night. He began his duties this morning. Spencer is only 28 years old. This decision to accept the appointment was recommended by Colson, the American financial advisor to the Abyssinian government. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa - Our correspondent, O'Chana, reports that palace officials in Abyssinia expect that an American, only 28 years old, will arrive here from French Djibouti tonight. It is rumored that he has been hired by the government as a specialized diplomatic advisor. However, the government is keeping his name and past qualifications a strict secret. It is expected that a detailed announcement will be made tomorrow. The Abyssinian government's original foreign diplomatic advisor was General Vilqin of Sweden, who had been working in Addis Ababa since before the Italo-Abyssinian War. He recently left his post and returned to his country due to ill health. It is rumored that the newly hired American gentleman will fill the vacancy left by General Vilqin. The legal advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor was originally Auberson of Switzerland, who also left Abyssinia last November to serve as a liaison between the Abyssinian delegation to the League of Nations and the Abyssinian Emperor. Currently, the only foreign advisor working in Addis Ababa is the American financial advisor Colson. (Havas dispatch from Havas News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - At today's cabinet meeting, the Japanese cabinet, because the Seiyukai, its largest opponent, is also divided into factions for and against dissolution, and its content is quite complex and difficult to predict, decided to adopt a two-pronged approach of both war and peace, and to respond flexibly. The routine cabinet meeting opened at 11 a.m. and adjourned at noon. All cabinet ministers attended. First, Foreign Minister Hirota reported on the progress of negotiations with the Chinese government authorities since the end of last year and the North China issue, as well as the opening of the new consulate in Abyssinia.

<p>Harbin - Seven students from Kyoto Imperial University set off from Hailar on the morning of the 2nd to travel to the Greater Khingan Mountains.

The winter in northern Manchuria is extremely cold, and the average temperature near Hailar is often minus 42 degrees Celsius. Even the Mongols rarely travel there, so local people advised them not to go, but the students said that they had conquered Mount Paektu in Korea last winter and had experience, so they decided to set off. They brought two Mongolian guides, ten horse-drawn carts, sufficient fuel, and other necessities, as well as Mongolian yurts and other items. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Chicago Maru and two other ships begin service</p>
<p>From Tokyo, Taiwan, Xiamen to Philippines</p>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: Japan's southward routes, in the past five or six years, only had the Taiwan-Keelung-Takao route via Xiamen, Shantou to Hong Kong, operated by Osaka Company's two ships and one ship between Taiwan and Fuzhou. Since last year (1935) it gradually expanded. During the Taiwan Exposition in the second half of the year, Osaka Company added four ships, Fengshan Maru, Di Li Maru, Guangdong Maru, and Twenty-Six Kyodo Maru, between Taiwan, Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong. Another route was set up between Taiwan, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, using Daikyu Maru. At the same time, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha resumed its Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou route, using Songshan Maru and Tangshan Maru. Since the winter, the Japanese military and the Governor-General of Taiwan convened a conference on tropical industries and a joint conference of the army, navy, and overseas Chinese in Taiwan, and decided to carry out a southward policy with Taiwan as the center, develop South China and Nanyang trade and shipping, and assist the economy of resident overseas Chinese. Regarding shipping, a new Nanyang route has been opened, first to Japan and the Philippines. The Xiamen branch of Osaka Shosen Kaisha recently received an order from the Japanese government to develop the Nanyang route. The head office has allocated three ships, Chicago Maru, Hikoji Maru, and Mexico Maru, with a deadweight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons. The route is from Tokyo via Osaka, Taiwan, Xiamen, to Manila, Cebu, Davao, and Legazpi in the Philippines as the final destination. Then, the return voyage from Legazpi will return to Japan. It is scheduled to start sailing at the beginning of this year. The first ship is Chicago Maru, which is scheduled to arrive in Xiamen on January 6 and then go to Manila. Hikoji Maru will pass Xiamen and open to the Philippines on January 22, and Mexico Maru will pass Xiamen and open to the Philippines on February 7. However, the three ships will pass through Xiamen on their southward voyage, while the northward voyage will return to Japan directly from the Philippines via Taiwan, without passing through Xiamen.

<h3 id="e100">Wuhu Public Accuses the Police Chief of Illegal Activities <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Arbitrary Extortion of Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>All Sectors Telegraph Requests for Severe Punishment Wuhu correspondence: Zhang Zongfen, the chief of the Wuhu Public Security Bureau, has implemented measures since taking office that are quite unsatisfactory to the citizens. Since the government issued the smoking ban, all sectors have assisted in its implementation because it is an important policy for national recovery. However, Zhang often forced non-smokers to obtain licenses or exceeded the prescribed amount of fines and arbitrarily imposed punishments. He even detained and punished non-smoking people with some assets at any time and place, causing everyone to be in danger. Last month, the Henan Hongda Chang Sauce Garden was burned down, killing eleven men, women, and children. However, Zhang actually detained Zhang Taisong, the young owner of the shop who had suffered a great disaster, and forced him to pay a fine of 600 yuan. At the same time, Li Zhizhi, the head of the Second Branch of the Bureau, also arrested Li Peizhi, the son of the former Wuhu Customs Superintendent Li Baoling and a committee member of the Hunan Fellow Villagers Association, falsely accusing him of smoking and fining him 220 yuan. A few days later, he was ordered to pay a reward of 30 yuan. Li painfully complied because he was told that if he did not comply, he would be paraded through the streets and sent to the head office, but because he did not smoke and had suffered such humiliation, he filed a complaint with the county party headquarters. As a result, public sentiment was aroused, and the party headquarters, the lawyers' association, and all industries in Wuhu elected representatives and held joint meetings at the county chamber of commerce. Each meeting was attended by hundreds of people. The first resolution of the conference was to report the facts of Zhang's corruption and the imminent civil unrest to the central government and departments, requesting them to send personnel to investigate and order the bureau chief to publicly announce all the fine accounts. Gao Tiejun, the former commissioner, Tao Yutang, a standing committee member of the chamber of commerce, Fang Dingzhong, the president of the lawyers' association, and other twelve people were elected as general representatives to petition the administrative commissioner's office and other institutions. At this point, Zhang, realizing that he could not offend public anger, immediately ordered Chief Li to run around asking for mediation and returned the illegally fined amount of 400 yuan from Hongda Chang and a promissory note for 200 yuan that had already been collected. Upon receiving the news, all sectors became even more resentful and held a general meeting at the county chamber of commerce on the afternoon of the fifth. Even more people attended. First, lawyer Hu Jiaxin reported the truth about the public security bureau chief's cruel and unreasonable fine on Hongda Chang and the recent return of the promissory note, saying that the lawyers' association had decided to file a lawsuit according to law to uphold human rights. At that time, the whole venue applauded. It was resolved to ask Administrative Inspector Gao Wenbo to report in public. He said briefly that after interviewing the petition representatives and reading the newspapers, he had summoned Zhang to the office to inquire about Zhang's disturbance of the people with the smoking ban. Zhang replied that the fire fine for Hongda Chang was 400 yuan, and the fine for smoking was 400 yuan. He had just heard that the promissory note had been returned. He did not understand this matter yet. In short, corrupt officials should be severely punished according to law, and Wuhu had caused public resentment due to the smoking ban, which was extremely rare among officials. Today, the people's sentiment is so enthusiastic, and he strongly agrees, but there must be concrete methods to do it so that this matter will never happen again in the locality, etc. After deliberation, the meeting passed resolutions to send telegrams to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Henan-Anhui Pacification Headquarters, the Anhui Provincial Government, the Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy's Office, the Nanjing Smoking Ban Inspection Headquarters, the National Smoking Ban Committee, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing. The original text of the telegrams is recorded below: "Nanjing: Separately reported to Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, Yu, President of the Control Yuan, Feng, Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, the Smoking Ban Headquarters, the National Smoking Ban Committee, Gu, Director of the Chongqing Executive Headquarters, Liu, Director of the Kaifeng Henan-Anhui Pacification Office, Liu, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government, Miao, Anhui-Jiangxi Supervisory Envoy, Fang Zhi, Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing, and all fellow villagers for their consideration: We respectfully observe that the banning of smoking and drugs is an important policy for national recovery, and the people should respectfully and diligently follow it. However, after Zhang Zongfen, the director of the Wuhu Public Security Bureau, took office, he condoned the police, arbitrarily arrested people, and imposed arbitrary fines, all outside the scope of the law. Taking the implementation of tobacco household registration as an example, if someone is privately smoking drugs, they should be dealt with according to the law. However, the bureau chief has extorted large sums of money from families with some assets in the city who do not smoke, arbitrarily forcing them to obtain licenses, using the smoking ban as a tool for extortion. The fines collected have never been issued a receipt, causing travelers to hesitate and everyone to be in danger. On December 31, local organizations held a joint meeting at the chamber of commerce and unanimously resolved that, in addition to the citizens who have been wronged collecting evidence and waiting for investigation, we should jointly report to you for your consideration and ask the Anhui Provincial Government to remove the bureau chief from office and investigate him to warn against corruption and reassure the people. We cannot help but pray. The rest are detailed in the report. Wuhu Lawyers' Association, County Chamber of Commerce, 58 Industry Associations, Chiefs of All Security Teams, Representatives of Real Estate, etc." Also, Li Peizhi, who was unjustly punished by the Second Branch for 250 yuan, has had his Hunan Fellow Villagers Association telegraph all parties, indignant and unable to calm down, requesting that justice be upheld. The local departments of the first, second, third, and fourth districts of Wuhu also held a joint meeting on the fifth and resolved that Cui Songgu, a comprador of the Sanbei Company, attended the smoking ban meeting previously convened by the Public Security Bureau. They ordered him to publicly announce what happened at that time and sent a letter to all parties' meetings, urging them not to compromise midway. Therefore, at the general meeting of all sectors, someone proposed that Commissioner Gao should first take custody of Zhang. (6th)</p>

<p>Bandits Send Letters to Scare and Extort Wealthy Households</p>
<p>Xiaokunshan in the fourth district of the county is near the Liuhe River, where bandits often appear. Now that it is severe winter, more than a dozen wealthy households have received threatening letters from bandits. The letters claim that funds are insufficient, and demand one or two hundred yuan or dozens of yuan. If they do not comply, they will use guns and bombs. Those who are brave ignore the letters, but those who are timid go to the meeting place specified by the bandits and pay the money to seek peace. It is heard that more than a dozen households in Xiaokunshan Town have been robbed because of their timidity.</p>

Yang Yongqing, the president of Soochow University in Suzhou, will of course attend the meeting at that time. On the student side, the law, science, and liberal arts colleges of the university have elected representatives and submitted them to President Yang for approval.

<p>Police and Militia Force Refugees to Leave the Territory</p>
<p>In Tangping Township, Yinqiao area, the tenth district of the county, more than 160 refugees from Hunan arrived on New Year's Day and disturbed the peace. They went to the home of villager Zhou Yichun and robbed him of more than 320 yuan in silver, two gold buttons, and destroyed the door. Villagers sounded the gong to call for help, and the refugees fled in a panic, drowning Zhang Xiaofu and Zhang Xiaoqing. The court verified that they had fallen into the river and died. However, the refugees used this as an excuse to occupy the area. Feng Junyan, the chief of the mountain area, and the patrol officer of the Seventh Police Station of Yuqi reported to the county government's public security bureau. The bureau sent Inspector Wang, but his attempts to suppress the refugees were ineffective. A few days ago, the county government dispatched 72 soldiers from the Fourth Security Brigade, together with the Shijiuwan, Luoshe, and Zhou militias, the Yuqi Security Police Station, and Wang, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Ge, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, the patrol officers of Yong Police District, and others, to suppress the refugees. The refugees insisted on demanding a court hearing before any action was taken, and then elected representatives Zhang Youcai and Yang Sien to meet with Long, the county magistrate, and Chen, the chief of the Public Security Bureau. County Magistrate Long persuaded them to leave the territory immediately and sent political police to accompany the refugee representatives, take a car to the countryside, gather more than a hundred strong men from the village to carry the luggage, and escort them to the city overnight. They stayed overnight at the Yansheng Temple, and were escorted out of the territory yesterday morning. The coffins of the two drowned refugees have been temporarily buried in the Shitouwan cemetery.</p>

<p>The banks issuing banknotes whose head offices are located in Shanghai are the Four Banks Reserve Vault (i.e., the China &amp; South Sea Bank, the Continental Bank, the Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, and the Kincheng Banking Corporation), the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Commercial Bank of China, the Pih Ming Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the Agricultural and Commercial Bank of China, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and the Reclamation Bank. As for the total amount of issuance and reserves, the Issuance Reserve Management Committee has already sent committee members such as Ye Zhuotang to complete separate inspections and completely handed them over to the vaults of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications designated by the committee for safekeeping. All procedures have been completely completed before the end of December 1935.</p>
<p>Handling the Closing</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Qian Xinzhi, Deputy General Manager of the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, yesterday morning. According to him, the Four Banks Reserve Vault was established for the issuance of banknotes by the four banks. Since the government reformed the currency system and centralized issuance, it complied with the ministerial order and handed it over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping. There is no need for this vault to exist anymore, and it should be closed immediately. Moreover, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and other banks issuing banknotes are handling it in the same way. As for the Four Banks Joint Savings Society, it will continue to operate as usual. According to reporters' inquiries at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the bank and others have handed over the banknotes and reserves they issued to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping, and the personnel of the issuance department have been either laid off or transferred to other departments.</p>
<p>Inspecting Legal Tender</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the inspection rules of the Issuance Reserve Management Committee, the committee has complied with the rules and implemented the inspection of the legal tender issuance amount and reserves of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, inspecting once a month, in addition to submitting reports to the Ministry of Finance for record and publicly announcing them monthly to demonstrate great faith. It is decided that after the Central Bank is reorganized into the Central Reserve Bank, it will specifically keep the reserves of various banks, manage the national treasury, and store all public funds, and will not engage in ordinary commercial banking business. After two years, it will enjoy the exclusive right to issue banknotes and become the bank of banks.</p>
<h3 id="e107">During the Final Closing Period, Monetary Conditions Were Relatively Loose <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Banks to Announce Last Year's Profits Today</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Applications for Industrial and Commercial Credit Loans</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the final closing period for various industries in 1935 is approaching. Qian Zhuang and others are prepared, and monetary conditions are looser than in previous years. There has been a sudden increase in credit loan applications to the Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee. Banks will announce last year's profits today, which will be announced by the Guild. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Monetary Conditions Looser</p>
<p>The Qian Zhuang Guild decided that after January 23 is the final closing period for 1935, all industries have prepared. Qian Zhuang tightened up all kinds of loans, such as credit mortgages, and paid attention to collection matters. They set the 15th as the settlement date for all business transactions. At the same time, due to the government's implementation of the new currency system policy and the bank's annual closing period, the market's monetary conditions are looser than in previous years. The Shanghai Qian Zhuang market's overnight interest rate was still 9% yesterday, that is, 9% daily interest per thousand yuan. The bank's reserve will yesterday's public bill interest rate was 10%, and the public bill discount rate was 15%.</p>
<p>Applying for Loans</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Loan Review Committee has been handling small credit loans since August 1 last year. At the end of last month, during the bank's annual closing period, there was a sudden increase in applications for loans from domestic industrial and commercial firms. Now, because the final closing of various industries for 1935 is approaching, the number of applicants to the Loan Review Committee in recent days has increased compared to the bank's annual closing period. The Committee is very busy investigating. After the Standing Committee of the Committee approves, the loans will be approved.</p>
<p>Bank Profits After the banks closed their books for 1935, in the midst of this economic depression, all banks that are members of the Banking Association made profits. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications made the most. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with Secretary-General Lin of the Banking Association yesterday. According to him, the Association has sent letters to various members to investigate last year's profits, and many have reported to the Association one after another. After gathering the information, it will be published for unification. It is scheduled to collect all the information tomorrow (i.e., today) and officially announce it.</p>
<h3 id="e108">After the Method for Exchanging Legal Tender Was Agreed Upon, Foreign Banks Paid in Silver <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The total is 30 million yuan, with Japanese banks accounting for 15%</p>
<p>The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications Stabilize Foreign Exchange with Good Results</p>
<p>The Banking Association's Market Committee Has Been Abolished</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the Ministry of Finance allowed the silver and money industries to obtain legal tender from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications with 60% silver and 40% guarantee, the method for foreign banks to pay in silver and exchange legal tender has been agreed upon, and various banks have complied with the regulations. Stabilizing foreign exchange has achieved good results, and the equalization tax has fallen. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Methods for Foreign Banks to Exchange Legal Tender</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance agreed on the method for foreign banks to exchange silver for legal tender, various foreign banks exchanged their silver reserves for legal tender at par with the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Now, Citibank, the Netherlands Bank, and the Deutsche Bank have all paid in. Citibank paid in another 2.5 million yuan yesterday. HSBC, McCallum, and other banks will also pay in within days. As for Japanese banks, such as Yokohama Specie Bank, it is said that they have also agreed to pay in. The total amount of silver deposited by foreign banks is more than 30 million yuan, with Japanese banks accounting for 15%.</p>
<p>Stabilizing Foreign Exchange Has Achieved Good Results</p>
<p>After foreign silver prices plummeted, foreign banks restricted the buying and selling of foreign exchange. The foreign exchange trading of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications increased sharply. Fortunately, after strenuous efforts to stabilize it, good results were achieved. Yesterday, the Central Bank quoted London at one shilling two pence and a half, New York at twenty-nine dollars seventy-five, and Paris at four hundred and fifty-one francs, which was equal to the previously determined standard number. HSBC quoted London at one shilling two pence three seven five, New York at twenty-nine dollars five, and Paris at four hundred and forty-seven francs. The equalization tax rate announced by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee yesterday morning has fallen to 7.75%, which has returned to the market conditions before November 4. All foreign banks have agreed to pay in silver to exchange legal tender, so taxpayers who transport silver for export have disappeared.</p>
<p>Bank Market Committee Abolished</p>
<p>Since the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications unconditionally traded foreign exchange, the Banking Association deleted Article 7 of the industry regulations, which published domestic and foreign market prices, and stopped publishing domestic and foreign market prices from January 4, abolishing the organization of the Market Committee. As for the Foreign Exchange Committee and the brokers and regulations for verifying foreign exchange, although they have not been abolished, in fact, banks that operate foreign exchange, such as the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, will handle the buying and selling of foreign exchange according to the Central Bank's quotation in the future, only taking commissions.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Taikoo Company's Rescue Ship Still Aground After Six Days of Rescue <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Taikoo Company's new Yangtze River ship Wuxue departed from Shanghai on the 31st of last month. On the afternoon of New Year's Day, while traveling near Shierxu above Zhenjiang, there was heavy rain and dense fog on the river, and the river water receded. The Wuxue ship suddenly ran aground. Due to the large amount of cargo and heavy draft, the bottom of the ship was deeply mired in shallow sand. For days, the company's upstream and downstream river ships have repeatedly towed it, but because the ship is grounded too deeply, it cannot get out of the shallow water. After receiving the telegram, the head office dispatched two iron barges to Shierxu on the 2nd of this month to prepare to gradually unload the cargo from the ship's various cabins. Yesterday, because there was more cargo and fewer barges, it dispatched another iron barge from Shanghai to the site to assist in unloading the cargo, so that the load could be reduced and the ship could float to the surface. Then, it could be towed again. Otherwise, if the river water continues to recede, it will be more difficult to escape. The cargo that has been unloaded will be transported to Wuhu by the upstream Changsha ship today and loaded with Wuhu cargo. Tomorrow, the export Juhu ship will go to load Hankou cargo.</p>

The luncheon did not end until about 2 p.m., when everyone dispersed happily. The details of the situation at that time are as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Agencies</p>
<p>The participants in yesterday afternoon's municipal government luncheon included all municipal government staff, officials above the director level of various departments, officials above the company commander level of the security team, chiefs and directors of various branches of the Public Security Bureau, directors and chiefs of police training centers, officials above the company commander level of the police corps, personnel above the detachment leader level of the detective team, officials above the director level of the municipal defense committee, members of the municipal council of each district, members of the National Military Training Committee and trainers, members and advisors of the Municipal Central District Construction Committee, officials above the director level of the municipal treasury, officials above the department chief level of the headquarters, important officials of the municipal bank and the industrial trust company, officers of the garrison regiment, and the director and deputy director of the municipal gazetteer, totaling more than 400 people.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's speech was as follows: "Today is the municipal government's New Year luncheon. In addition to the municipal government colleagues, we have also invited comrades from the Shanghai Garrison Command and the garrison regiment to participate. The significance of the luncheon is twofold: First, comrades serving in various positions in the city usually focus on their duties and cannot gather together often. On the occasion of the New Year, we have this opportunity to meet each other. Second, I have been in Shanghai for four years. The past four years, with the severity of national disasters and the many troubles in the region, have been the most difficult times since the establishment of the city. Since the Shanghai War, the city has not recovered its vitality, and the local finances have been extremely difficult. Fortunately, the municipal government colleagues and talented people from all walks of life have shouldered the heavy burden together. Not only have the local difficulties been resolved, but the local cause has also been built. I cannot but take this opportunity to express my admiration and gratitude. On the occasion of the New Year, what should we do to establish a direction and work together? I remember that President Chiang gave a broadcast speech to the people of the country on New Year's Day, in which he put forward two major goals: one is the New Life Movement, and the other is the National Economic Construction Movement. The former is spiritual construction, which aims to cultivate the people's sound personality, and to strive forward with the spirit of constant improvement to enrich the driving force for national revival and development. The latter is material construction, which aims to improve the people's livelihood, establish the foundation of the national economy, and seek to coexist with the advanced countries of the world. Therefore, the New Life Movement is the spiritual foundation of national revival, and the National Economic Construction Movement is the material foundation for enriching national strength. I would like to work with all comrades to implement these goals, each striving to practice them from the position of daily life and work, in order to save the country and revitalize the nation. Finally, the garrison regiment has made great achievements in maintaining law and order in Shanghai in recent years, and I should also take this opportunity to express my gratitude and wish all comrades present a Happy New Year." The speech was quite enthusiastic and moving.</p>
<p>Pan and Yu's Speeches</p>
<p>Director Pan's speech was as follows: "The international situation is fluctuating and critical, and the crisis ahead is unpredictable. We should calmly respond to the crisis of 1936 and strive to implement the New Life Movement and the National Economic Construction Movement to prepare for survival." Secretary-General Yu's speech was as follows: "The direction of saving the country has been earnestly instructed by the Mayor, and the international crisis has also been detailed by Director Pan. I am deeply moved and can only hope that the municipal government colleagues will unite sincerely, work hard in the public interest, and jointly shoulder the heavy burden to overcome this difficult time."</p>
<p>Photographic Commemoration</p>
<p>After the luncheon, it was already past 2 p.m. They left their seats and gathered in front of the municipal government to take pictures as a memento, and then dispersed happily. It is said that yesterday was the fourth anniversary of Mayor Wu's inauguration, and the New Year's luncheon was also the first, and it was also the fourth anniversary of the Mayor's inauguration.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 5 PM, the Shanghai Municipal Local Association held a New Year tea party. Attendees included Du Yuesheng, Qin Runqing, Yang Zhixiong, Jiang Wenyu, Shen Zengkuan, Chen Bin, Wang Kui Sheng, Huang Renzhi, Hu Yunqiu, Zhang Peinian, Zhu Ziqiao, Zhu Xuefan, Huang Zongxun, Liu Hongsheng, Hua Runquan, Xu Zhiyi, Zai Boqi, Wang Yansong, Pan Yangyao, Chu Huiseng, Qu Yue, Xu Jiluo, Yang Weiyu, Tao Leqin, Yan Ese, Xu Yongzuo, Luo Qinghua, Gui Yanfang, Qian Xinzhi, Xu Caicheng, Zou Bingwen, Qi Yunqing, Xu Xinliu, Wang Boyuan, Xu Fengshi, Yan Fuqing, Li Zukui, Yao Yongli, He Dekui, Zhang Weiru, Pan Zhiwen, and more than 40 others. Chairman Du Yuesheng began by saying that the association had moved to a new location and was holding its first gathering on the occasion of the New Year. He wished everyone good health, noting that while the association was housed in a four-story building, it should not forget the suffering of the majority of the city's populace and that future work should start from the grassroots level to seek the welfare of the people. Vice Chairman Qian Xinzhi stated that he had previously heard Mayor Wu say that several hundred thousand yuan would be allocated from the municipal bonds to build a "People's Village" for common people to live in. He also mentioned that there were 150,000 rickshaw pullers and that it was necessary to build a certain number of vehicles and rent them to rickshaw pullers at a low price so that they could eventually own their own vehicles. The association should do its best to help make this happen. He also noted that he saw in a foreign newspaper that a survey in November of the 24th year showed that Shanghai's population was 3,544,455 in 424,113 households, an increase of more than seven times the population of Shanghai during the Qing Dynasty's Daoguang tenth year. Shanghai should be a very prosperous city, but since the January 28th Incident, things have been deteriorating, and the increase in population has not been proportional. Colleagues should study and work harder. Member Wang Yansong said that the difficulties of the national environment are increasing year by year, and that for the sake of the country, for the sake of our careers, and for our own survival, we should be more united and work harder. Guest Leng Yuqiu stated that the local association was reorganized from the local maintenance association. In these four years, the national crisis has become even more serious than before. Every day, he hears the groans of suffering from all over the country. To try to save the situation, the whole people must work together. He still hopes for the efforts of everyone in the association. Member Jiang Wenyu stated that he had just heard Chairman Du and Qian speak about the association's work this year, which would start with the lower-level people. This is the common feeling of the colleagues. He secretly thinks that if there are things that can benefit the general public without spending money, it may be good to do a few things first, such as: providing legal counsel for those who cannot afford to litigate; and providing medical and pharmaceutical advice for those who cannot afford medical treatment and medication. If the association can invite lawyers and doctors from among its members, or the backbone of the pharmaceutical industry, to form a committee to provide defense and medical treatment to the public, even for just one day, it would be an immeasurable blessing. Mu Ouchu said that if we want to serve the public, we should first fill our own spirit, strengthen our physique, endure hardship, and achieve the realm of being able to do what we say. Chu Huiseng said that he hopes that his colleagues will continue to fight with the spirit of the past and deal with the current environment. If we want to survive, we must seek it from death. Then, Chairman Du announced the formation of the 25th Year Work Plan Committee. After Wang Yan, Xu Caicheng, Wang Yansong, Pan Yangyao, and Huang Zongmian, the meeting concluded with cheers for "Long live the Republic of China, long live Shanghai, long live the Shanghai Municipal Local Association."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Black Fever Has a Tendency to Spread to the Jiangnan Region; Chairman of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce Leng Yuqiu Came to Shanghai to Discuss Eradication Methods; Zhenjiang Hongren Hospital and Other Institutions Spent a Large Sum of Money to Engage in Eradication <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Black fever has been found in the Jiangbei area and is spreading to various places. The disease is quite severe and has a tendency to affect the Jiangnan area. Leng Yuqiu, Chairman of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, recently came to Shanghai to discuss eradication methods. It is heard that the local Hongren Hospital and other institutions have already spent a large sum of money to engage in eradication. The situation has been explored from the relevant aspects of this port, as follows. Black fever originated in the tropics. Patients have enlarged spleens. It was discovered in India and the Mediterranean coast in the 18th century. It then spread to Annam, Siam, the Philippines, the Caucasus, Turkestan, Asia Minor, the Americas, Panama, and North Africa. This disease was discovered in Hebei, Shandong, and other provinces in my country 30 years ago. At first, it was not noticed by the general public. In the 12th year of the Republic of China, it had already invaded Jiangsu Province, and the Xu, Huai, and Hai regions of Jiangbei were all affected. After the great flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the epidemic spread even wider. Patients with the disease are not easy to cure, and the number of deaths is increasing day by day. The harm is extraordinary. The central and provincial governments and other departments have successively organized investigation, research, and treatment institutions to actively carry out eradication. In recent years, although many people have been cured, the epidemic area has expanded, and the number of treatment institutions is limited. The spread has not been effectively controlled. In the future, the methods of prevention should be given extra effort. According to the investigation of the Black Fever Research Team, the disease spreads very quickly, increasing as much as 24 times in four years. Recently, the number of black fever patients diagnosed and treated by Zhenjiang Hongren Hospital has also been increasing day by day. Judging from this situation, the disease has crossed the Yangtze River to the south today. If this continues without being stopped, it will be easy for it to spread to Shanghai, where people from all over the world live, due to the convenience of the Beijing-Shanghai traffic. From Shanghai, it will spread to other places, which is truly frightening. For the sake of the present, in order to prevent the disease from affecting places where it has not yet been found, it is necessary to first eliminate the source of the disease in places where it has already occurred. In particular, it is necessary to widely publicize the transmission routes, symptoms, and treatments of the disease so that all places know how to take precautions.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Overseas Radio Telephone Communication; The International Telecommunications Bureau Is Actively Carrying Out; China-Japan Communication Is Scheduled to Be Implemented on February 15 <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matters of radio telephone communication between China and Japan, China and the United Kingdom, etc., the reporter learned the following from the International Telecommunications Bureau yesterday:</p>
<p>China-Japan Communication Next Month 15th</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications and the Japanese Ministry of Communications signed a contract last year, they have been actively carrying out communication for China-Japan radio telephones. It is now scheduled to be formally launched on February 15th. However, if preparations are not completed by then, the person in charge of the Telecommunications Bureau said that the date will be slightly delayed.</p>
<p>Principles for Deciding on Charging Methods</p>
<p>As for the charging methods for China-Japan communication, the principles have already been decided, that is, the charging for communication will generally be based on a three-minute standard. Regardless of whether the communication is one minute or two minutes, it will be charged according to three minutes. However, after three minutes, four minutes, five minutes, etc., will all be counted as four minutes and five minutes. Also, one second over three minutes will be counted as four minutes, and so on for four minutes, five minutes, six minutes, etc.</p>
<p>China-UK and China-US Are Actively Underway</p>
<p>As for communication with France, the UK, Italy, the US, and the Philippines, China-UK is actively underway and is in the testing phase. China-US and China-Philippines are also actively carrying out communication procedures, but have not yet been tested. China-France was tested once last year, and the results were very good, but it was temporarily suspended due to a lack of equipment. The Bureau is still actively preparing for communication with various countries and will communicate as soon as possible. The reason for the temporary suspension of communication with a certain country is actually due to insufficient equipment or other ongoing matters that have not yet been completed, so it has to be temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e128">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Instructs on Methods for Replacing and Affixing Stamps on Account Books; The General Closing Date Is the Principle; The Accounting Year Is the Exception <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce issued two letters yesterday regarding the annual replacement and affixing of stamps on account books, providing some explanations. Reply to Yong Sheng Yi Fertilizer Radio Company: "I received your letter on the 6th of this month, inquiring about the methods for replacing and affixing stamps on account books. I am now replying as follows: According to Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law, regardless of when various account books subject to stamp tax begin to be used, the validity period of the stamp tax tickets affixed shall end on the date of the annual commercial closing of the year. If the accounts are closed according to the accounting year, the validity period shall end at the end of the accounting year. If they are continued to be used after the expiration date, new stamp tax tickets shall be affixed. The period for replacing and affixing stamp tax tickets on account books shall be based on the date of the commercial closing in principle and the accounting year as an exception. The two methods are at the discretion of the merchants and are not fixed. If your company's accounts are based on the accounting year from the Gregorian calendar New Year's Day to the end of December of the Gregorian calendar, at the end of the accounting year, either new account books are replaced, or old account books are continued to be used, and new stamps are affixed, which is not inconsistent with the provisions of Article 10 of the regulations." Reply to the Nanhui Town Business and People's Municipal Promotion Association: "I received your letter on the 6th of this month, inquiring about the matters of affixing stamp tax. I am now replying as follows: If the 24th year account books were opened before September 1 of the Gregorian calendar and the stamp was fully affixed at one corner in accordance with the old regulations, they can be used until the date of the commercial closing in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Implementing Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law. If the old books are continued to be used after the expiration date, a stamp of two corners should be added in accordance with the law. The commercial closing date was originally January 31 according to the decision of the Executive Yuan, but the actual closing date this year is January 23, so there is no conflict with the statutory provisions to replace or add stamps from January 24. If the 'disclosure slip' mentioned in the letter is the collection slip used for the New Year's Festival, which only lists the amount of the outstanding balance and does not list the name, quantity, and price of the goods, it is not necessary to affix a stamp in accordance with Article 3, Section 9 of the Stamp Tax Law and Article 5 of the Implementing Regulations of the Stamp Tax Law. The 'disclosure book' mentioned in the letter is not known to what it refers. If it refers to the disclosure book for borrowing goods or accounts receivable and payable at ordinary times, then this disclosure book, whether it was opened before September 1 of the 24th year or after that date, cannot be exempted from affixing stamps in accordance with the old regulations and the new tax law. Therefore, the statement in the letter that it can be exempted from affixing stamps is a fundamental misunderstanding. The date for replacing stamps every year has been answered in detail in the first item above."</p>

The original telegram is recorded below: Sent to Jiang (Chiang) of the Executive Yuan, Jiang of the Minister of Interior, and Wu of the Minister of Industry, Shengsi Islands are the gateway to the Yangtze River and have always been governed by Jiangsu. All is well. Recently, because Chongming County established a district for rectification and cracked down on fishermen collecting money, these people's livelihoods were cut off and they made alarming statements. Residents of the islands have telegraphed the provincial government to oppose it. The recent armed detention of ships and extortion of flag fees by Shi Jincheng and others on the island is enough to see the situation. We respectfully telegraph and urge the leaders to investigate and not be deceived, maintain the status quo, and reassure the good people. We await orders with extreme urgency.

<h3 id="e138">Notice from the Local Court: Important Information for Criminal Self-Suits <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin of the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office issued a notice yesterday stating that the Jiangsu High Court had forwarded a directive from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, emphasizing that the new Criminal Procedure Law has been in effect for some time, and the scope of self-suits has been greatly expanded compared to the past. However, people often cling to old habits and are unfamiliar with the new law, with many still filing complaints with the prosecutor's office when they should be initiating self-suits. Therefore, when local court prosecutor's offices receive cases that qualify for self-suits, they must follow previous orders, promptly instruct the complainants to file lawsuits directly with the court, and allow them to correct the original complaints and submit them directly to the court. The court must not refuse to accept the cases simply because the written complaint has been temporarily changed. This will make the self-suit system more effective and streamline the litigation process. In addition to instructing the prosecutor on duty when accepting cases, this notice is hereby issued to inform all litigants. Furthermore, the Local Court, to facilitate the understanding of the scope of self-suits for parties concerned, has separately recorded "Important Information for Self-Suits," listing each item in detail for easy reference. If any party concerned is unclear about self-suits, they can request a copy from the court's filing office. The full text of the "Important Information for Self-Suits" is recorded below: Anyone who is a direct victim of a crime and has legal capacity may file a self-suit. (This includes any individual who is a direct victim of a crime. For example, if an individual is directly victimized by a crime, even if their family or society is also victimized at the same time, the victimized individual may still file a self-suit.) To file a self-suit, a self-suit complaint must be submitted to the competent court, along with a copy of the complaint for each defendant. The self-suit complaint should include: (1) the defendant's name, gender, age, occupation, and characteristics; (2) the facts of the crime and evidence. If a complaint has already been filed, the words "complaint" can be changed to "self-suit," and the words "prosecutor" can be changed to "Criminal Division of the Court." A self-suit may not be filed against a direct ascendant relative or spouse. If a crime that is subject to prosecution or request is no longer eligible for prosecution or request, a self-suit may not be filed. (The phrase "no longer eligible for prosecution or request" refers to cases where a crime subject to prosecution has had the prosecution withdrawn, or a crime subject to request has had the request withdrawn after the six-month period for filing a request has expired.) A self-suit may not be filed if the same case has been concluded by the prosecutor's office. A person who withdraws a self-suit may not file a self-suit again.</p>

<p>Xu Shoufeng, a 37-year-old unemployed photographer from Zhenjiang, lured unemployed men and women with financial incentives to photograph large quantities of sexually explicit images. He then wholesaled them to others for profit. This was discovered by Dong Mingde and Xu Yaoting, leaders of the 16th Precinct Detective Squad of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. Yesterday, they secretly dispatched team leaders Liu Jinsheng and Wu Songshan, detectives Yuan Zhigang, Pan Qifu, and Li Guisheng, along with police officer Wang Yunshan from the Laobeimen Police Station, to secretly investigate the address at the kiosk at No. 23 Dajing Street, Dajing Road. They found Xu Shoufeng and his assistant Qian Xiao-hai, as well as a suspect named Chen Yanzhi, and arrested them all. They also confiscated a camera, 13 boxes of large glass negatives, six boxes of small glass negatives, 500 sexually explicit photos of men and women, 15 rolls of black-and-white paper, over 70 sets of sexually explicit samples, and photographic chemicals. According to Xu Shoufeng, he is 36 years old, from Zhenjiang, and was employed at the Rongxin Photo Studio on Jiaotong Road in the Public Concession in June of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), earning a wage of 70 yuan. One of the women in the photos, named A-Liu, was a prostitute who worked for a company. Another woman was hired by A-Liu for 20 yuan. He moved to his current address on Dajing Road in March of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), where he developed photos. Qian Xiao-hai, 28 years old, stated that he was a photographer by trade but was unemployed. He was recruited by Xu to help him. Chen Yanzhi, 26 years old, from Nantong, stated that he was a carpenter and had come to watch, which is why he was arrested. The squad leader immediately submitted all the evidence and confiscated items to the 16th Precinct Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

In order to find solace and continue his lineage, Chen rented a house with a woman named Wang Nanzhen at No. 6, Lane 11, Beihe Road. However, he continued to provide living expenses for Qi. In January of that year, Wang became pregnant, and was three months along when Qi found out and went to make a scene, leading to a conflict. As a result, Wang miscarried. With the mediation of friends and relatives, a lawsuit was avoided. In the winter of that year, Chen and Qi both took sleeping pills in an attempt to commit suicide together. Fortunately, they were rescued in time. From then on, the animosity between the couple deepened. On the morning of the fourth of this month, Qi, accompanied by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Xinzha Police Station, went to No. 6, Lane 11, Beihe Road to catch Chen and Wang in the act of adultery. Both were arrested and sent to the criminal division of the First Special Court for interrogation. They were released on bail of 800 yuan each pending sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce of the First Special Court issued a verdict in the Second Criminal Court, sentencing Chen Zongyu to two months imprisonment for adultery while married, and Wang Nanzhen to two months imprisonment for committing adultery. Both sentences were suspended for two years. Chen declared in court that he was not satisfied with the verdict and would appeal.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Russian Concierge Commits Suicide: Post-Mortem Examination; Body Claimed by the Russian Veterans Association <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>An old man by the translated name of Wulaoluofuluofu, 28 years old, the concierge of the Ruizhi Iron Factory at No. 516 Yangqiao Road, was known for his diligence and thrift, and was therefore highly trusted by the factory. At around 7 AM the day before yesterday, the Russian returned to the factory and walked to his bedroom. He suddenly raised his own pistol and fired a shot into his right temple, collapsing unconscious. After those in the factory heard the gunshot, they reported it to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. An ambulance was called to the scene and rushed him to Gongji Hospital, where he died without effect. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Tang, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. According to Western patrol leader Sidiwens, the deceased had been working at the Ruizhi Iron Factory since 1931, and his diligence was clear to all. However, he was fond of drinking. When the Meifeng Bank collapsed last year, the deceased lost over 700 yuan. The factory employs several Russian police officers, all of whom were under his management. On the 5th of this month, the factory issued 160 yuan for the Russian police officers' meals, which was given to him to distribute. However, he did not go on duty that night, but went out alone. He returned at around 7 AM the next morning and, while changing into his uniform in the bedroom, he suddenly told two other Russian police officers that he had used up not only his own money last night, but also the money for the other police officers' meals. Shortly after the two officers left, they heard a gunshot and immediately returned, finding him dead. According to Russian Yalishan Daofu, who works as a patrol leader at the Huishan Police Station, he had known the deceased for 18 years. They had served in the Russian army together. After the war broke out in Russia, they came to Shanghai together. They had formed a Russian Veterans Mutual Aid Association, with over 20 members, all of whom worked as bodyguards, watchmen, and other professions in Shanghai. As a committee member of the association, he knew that the deceased had no relatives in the world, so he represented the association and wished to claim the body for burial. Tang, having heard the statements, ordered that the deceased, Russian Wulaoluofuluofu, male, died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The body was handed over to Yalishan Daofu, a committee member of the Russian Veterans Mutual Aid Association, for burial. The pistol and four bullets were returned to the factory owner. The deceased's belongings were handed over to the Russian Veterans Mutual Aid Association for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Jin Yaokang, 26 years old, from Yangzhou, had studied at Great China University in Shanghai. However, he dropped out of school after his parents passed away last summer. He was currently living with a classmate when he suddenly became despondent and bought six small silver coins' worth of opium from a friend. After swallowing it, he went outside and walked to Zhongshan Road on the west side of the Central Mint in West Shanghai. The poison took effect, and he collapsed on the ground. After a passerby saw him, they immediately reported it to the police station, which summoned an ambulance to rush him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road. It is reported that he had ingested a large amount of poison and his life was in grave danger.</p>

<p>The dredging of the Hengli River in the first and third districts of Shanghai County, scheduled to begin on January 5th, has already been reported in the news. According to reliable sources, building the dam to start work will still take some time, and the water draining work will have to wait until the end of the month to begin. The original plan was to complete it in May, but there is a fear that it will not be completed on schedule, which will affect spring plowing. The sacrifice of the soybeans and wheat planted on both sides of the river will also be inevitable. Therefore, the township heads of Beiqiao Town, Yuqi Township, Shouhua Township, and Dashu Township, as well as gentry along the river, all sent telegrams to the provincial government and the county party headquarters and county government, requesting that preparations be delayed until the fall. However, the county government considers dredging the Hengli River as one of the central tasks of this year, and it must be carried out. Half of the provincial subsidy of 5,000 yuan for dredging the river has already been received.</p>

<p>Pushan Villa organizes charitable activities such as providing coffins for the exposed dead and dispensing medicine, but it has never had sufficient funds. As the market is depressed and fundraising is difficult, and the work is enormous, the need for funds is pressing. Therefore, directors Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, and Yuan Ludeng initiated a fundraising performance at the Grand Theatre on Erma Road on January 9th. All participants are famous figures, ladies, and well-known amateurs from Shanghai. For example, the Hua Rong Dao by Layman Mude, the Lianhuan Tao by Master Hezhai, and the Fenghuang Shan by Yuan Senqi are all outstanding performances. The Twelve Taibao by Wang Detian, the Qu Chengdu by Yao Mulian, the Zhuo Fang Cao by Tang Shizhen, and the Huanghelou by Qian Juyou are all famous actors in the opera world, unlike anything else. Ladies from prominent families, such as Misses Gui Fen and Gui Fang, daughters of Lu Liankui, performing Wu Jia Po, Miss Shen Yuanyu's Deyiyuan, and Miss Chen Meiyin's Jin Suo Ji, are all enthusiastic about public welfare, which is commendable. In addition, the 70-year-old Chen Liangyu will perform Da Deng Bao Dian, which is also rare. It is expected that the red stage will be adorned with flowers, and the roads near Jiujiang Road will be bustling with traffic. Gentlemen who enjoy music will not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued Notice No. 1 Tong of the 25th year stating that members who serve as legal counsel to clients must issue consultant certificates. Some members design and prepare these certificates themselves, while others purchase them from vendors. The engagement contracts signed with clients are also prepared by the members themselves, resulting in inconsistent formats. This urgently needs to be improved for convenience. Therefore, a standard legal consultant certificate and engagement contract have been created, with a focus on solemnity and elegance, using only the finest materials. They will be sold at cost starting on January 1, 1936. Legal consultant certificates will be sold at 1.10 yuan per book of 25, and engagement contracts will be sold at 2 fen each. This notice is hereby issued, and all members must use these standardized forms.</p>

<p>The Suzhou Pinghua and Tanci industry originally had the Guangyu Society. In recent years, the number of members has grown to reach a thousand. After the popularity of Shanghai radio stations, many famous artists came to Shanghai. There is also a local organization in Shanghai called the Runyu Society. Recently, in order to expand its scope, the Guangyu Society specially obtained approval from the local party and government authorities to establish the Shanghai Pinghua and Tanci Research Association. The former president of the Guangyu Society, the famous Three Kingdoms artist Huang Zhaolin, has been running around for months preparing for the establishment of the Research Association, which finally held its inaugural meeting at the People's Education Center on the 5th of this month. At that time, Huang's intention in expanding the organization was to jointly operate with the Shanghai Runyu Society, inviting the society to join at the same time, so that they could cooperate in different ways, standing on the same starting point. The association's affairs are handled by a committee system, so that they are jointly responsible. However, no members of the Runyu Society attended the founding meeting, and the association still welcomes their participation. It is largely hoped that this will become a reality. The meeting held a vote to elect members and the results were: Executive Committee - Huang Zhaolin, Wei Yuqing, Jiang Yifei, Li Boquan, Jiang Ruting; Supervisory Committee - Han Shiliang, Wu Jun'an, Xia Hesheng; Alternate Executive Committee Members - Zhu Yaoting, Zhu Jiesheng. The resolutions proposed and decided at the meeting with the agreement of the public were: Members performing, except for charitable obligations, disaster relief, and for the association's expenses, other performances are generally rejected; Following the central government's clear provisions, it is forbidden for men and women to perform storytelling together, in order to maintain morality; Following the instructions of the Education Bureau, the Runyu Society is welcome to join. In addition, the Guangyu Society runs the Yucai Primary School in Suzhou, which has always been maintained by the society's appropriation of funds. Tuition fees are waived for poor students, benefiting the local area and being pragmatic. Now, Committee Member Huang plans to rectify it to improve the organization, and plans to have the association raise funds to make it last longer. Mr. Huang will be hired by Wuxi next year, and the association's affairs will be temporarily presided over by the committees in Shanghai at that time. The Guangyu Society has come to this point today, and Mr. Huang's contribution is the greatest.</p>

<p>Professor Jackson lectured again yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM in the engineering building of Jiaotong University. About 300 people attended. The topic was Engineering and Vocational Education in the United States. The main point was that the engineer's duty is to study theory and invent new instruments to promote the progress of material civilization. Therefore, engineering and vocational schools in the United States can be divided into three types: Apprentice schools, whose purpose is to train skilled craftsmen; Vocational schools, which are specifically for training foremen and managers. Most states have this type of school; Engineering schools, of which there are 150 in the country, with one-third affiliated with provincial universities, and the remainder funded by private donations. There are tens of thousands of students. After graduation, they engage in research, design, and senior management, and many create their own businesses. The purpose of training is to cultivate talents who invent new methods, create new industries, and promote engineering progress. In addition to basic sciences and engineering academics, the school places particular emphasis on research work, and does not neglect common sense of social sciences. After the lecture, many important issues were discussed until 7:00 PM. Professor Jackson will stay in Shanghai for a few more days before going to Beijing. This lecture tour in China was initiated by the Chinese Institute of Electrical Engineers. The travel expenses were donated by the Capital Power Plant, Qixi Yandi Power Plant, Hangzhou Electric Company, Jiaotong University, Tsinghua University, National Central University, Peiyang University, Zhejiang University, Jinling University, the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and other organizations.</p>

<p>Recognizing the great harm caused by opium, the central government is determined to ban it in stages and has specially appointed Military Affairs Commission Chairman Chiang as the Director-General of Opium Suppression. At the same time, the previously promulgated Opium Suppression Law and the articles on the treatment of opium crimes in the new Criminal Code have been abolished. All opium and drug cases will be handled seriously in accordance with the opium and drug prohibition regulations promulgated by the Director-General of Opium Suppression. However, due to the agreement made when the First Special District Court of this city recovered jurisdiction over the concessions, the court still applies the articles on opium crimes in the Criminal Code to opium cases after the abolition of the Opium Suppression Law. The Opium and Drug Prohibition Regulations have not yet taken effect in the concessions. Director Guo Yunguan of the court deeply regrets this and has recently negotiated and consulted with the Municipal Council several times. Fortunately, the foreigners also understand the importance of opium prohibition and should cooperate fully to achieve the effect of banning it within the time limit. Therefore, they have agreed to Director Guo's proposal. In the future, opium and drug cases cracked in the concessions will be prosecuted in court in accordance with the Opium and Drug Prohibition Regulations. However, the provision in the regulations that opium and drug cases should be subject to military trial will not be temporarily applied in the concessions. They must be handled as ordinary criminal cases in accordance with the statutory procedures, with a three-level, three-trial system. As for the date of implementation, it is said that Director Guo has also agreed with the Municipal Council that it will be from the 11th of this month. After that, anyone residing in the Public Concession who has an opium addiction will be subject to more severe punishment once arrested.</p>

<p>The Director of Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital is Accused of Negligence. The Plaintiff Eloquently Recounts the Doctor's Extortion of Surgical Fees.</p>
<p>The Hongkou Obstetrics Hospital, located at 913 Haining Road, was founded by Shen Zhaoquan from Nantong, with Shen himself serving as the director. On the night of December 1st of last year, the wife of Zheng Taici, an employee of the Ningbo Daily newspaper residing at 12 Lane 37, Beihe Road, went into labor. Two obstetricians, male and female, from the hospital were invited to the home to assist in the delivery. After the two doctors performed surgery, the fetus was extracted, already dead. The woman was ill from that point on, and although the hospital continually sent doctors to treat her, she still died on the 7th of that month. Zheng Taici was saddened by the loss of his child and mourned the death of his wife. He was convinced that it was due to the negligence of the hospital's doctors, and he filed a criminal self-prosecution with the First Special District District Court against its director, Shen Zhaoquan, for injury and fraud. Shen, however, was unwilling to accept this blame, so he also sued Zheng Taici for defamation, etc. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang held a court hearing, summoning both parties for investigation. According to the plaintiff Zheng Taici's statement, on the night of November 1st, he went to the Hongkou Hospital to request a doctor. The hospital immediately dispatched</p>
<p>a female doctor surnamed He and a male doctor surnamed Zhang to his home. They first gave the woman an injection, but she still did not give birth. The doctor then said that surgery was necessary and that the surgical fee had different grades, roughly from 70 to 300 yuan. Because of my financial difficulties, I repeatedly asked for a reduction, and the result was reduced to 35 yuan, and I was asked to sign a statement stating that I would not be responsible for the danger to life, and the surgical fee had to be paid first. I only paid four yuan at the time, and it was late at night, so there was no way to raise the remaining 31 yuan. The doctor then ordered a statement to be written, limiting the</p>
<p>deadline to 2:00 PM, and both documents required me to find a guarantor. I had to turn to the second landlord, surnamed Cai, to sign as a guarantor, and the doctor then performed the procedure. It was not until 3:30 that the fetus was extracted. They then said that the child's life could not be guaranteed, and they would be responsible for the woman. When they left, they asked for car fare, so I gave them two small dollars and 24 copper coins. From the deadline day on, the hospital continually sent people to ask for the remaining surgical fee, claiming that the female doctor surnamed He was going elsewhere and the procedures should be settled, and ordered me to write a report to the director, stating that the woman</p>
<p>was no longer in danger. On the fourth day, I went to see the director and told him about the attitude of the two doctors He and Zhang that night. The defendant then claimed that the hospital's directors were all famous people in Shanghai, and denied that the two doctors He and Zhang had extorted money. On one hand, he personally accompanied Doctor Wei to my home, prescribed two kinds of medicines, which I purchased, and gave the woman an injection. Unexpectedly, the woman died on the 7th. Even after her death, blood continued to flow. I had consulted with various doctors and only then learned that the injection given by the defendant could only</p>
<p>relieve pain and reduce fever, and not replenish blood or stop bleeding. Based on this, the woman was actually killed by the doctor, etc. When questioned, the defendant Shen Zhaoquan admitted that because the female doctor surnamed He was going elsewhere, the accounting department went to ask for the remaining fee. He then said that Zheng had never mentioned bleeding in the notes he wrote repeatedly. When I went to see the patient, I saw that her fever had increased to 41 degrees, and the symptoms were dangerous. I blamed him for not using a midwife first. Zheng then begged me to do my best to treat her, and I prescribed two medicines. However, Zheng only purchased one of the fever-reducing medicines, so I ordered Doctor Wei Yueyuan to give an injection. On the deadline day, Doctor Wei went again, and the woman had already entered a</p>
<p>comatose state. Wei did not want to continue the treatment. Zheng was immediately angry and said, "You can leave." When Zheng heard Shen's testimony, he immediately argued that he had never trusted midwives, and had not asked for a midwife this time either. As for the two medicines prescribed by the defendant at the time, I purchased them simultaneously from the Sino-American Pharmacy on Haining Road. Unexpectedly, the defendant did not know why and only used one medicine for injection, and did not use the medicine that could save lives. When he spoke, he also presented the pharmacy's invoice as proof. Judge Yang said that the case still needed to be investigated and ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>

<p>Book Boy Suddenly Sobbed When He Saw His Biological Father, Recounting the Horrific Details of Abuse Vividly.</p>
<p>-Judge Rebukes Appellant for Being Inhuman-</p>
<p>Zhong Qichang, a 23-year-old college student from Pinghu residing at 36 Baokang Lane 315, Xiafei Road, French Concession, bought Chu Along's son, Lai Fa (now 9 years old), a villager outside the South Gate of Pinghu, as a book boy two years ago. He brought him to Shanghai, making him do adult work. In the evening, he made him serve Zhong while he smoked opium, and only allowed him to sleep at 2:00 or 3:00 AM. If he was careless in his work or dozed off at night, he would be beaten with sticks. He also restricted his food intake, causing Lai Fa to be covered in</p>
<p>injuries and bruises, hindering his development. On the night of November 14th of last year, Zhong beat Lai Fa severely. The second landlord, Li Liansheng, a detective from the French Concession police station, discovered that the child Lai Fa had serious injuries. Considering Zhong to be inhumane, he reported it to the French Concession police station, who arrested Zhong Qichang and searched out opium smoking paraphernalia and rattan and wooden sticks used to beat the child. He was sent to the Second Special Court, where the French Concession Police Department filed a public prosecution against him for four crimes: obstructing freedom, enslaving someone, injury, and opium use. After a trial by Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu,</p>
<p>Zhong Qichang was sentenced on November 28th of last year to six months in prison for inflicting abuse on a man under the age of sixteen, thereby obstructing his natural physical development; one year in prison for enslaving someone; and a fine of six qian for opium use. Zhong refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>
<p>The Third Branch of the High Court, based on the appeal, held a hearing yesterday by Sun Honglin, Wang Yue, and Li Changnian, three judges, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, in the Third Criminal Court. Judge Sun presided over the trial. Attorney Gu Shouxi appeared in court on behalf of the French Concession Police Department. The appellant Zhong Qichang arrived with his defense attorney. After questioning Zhong about his age and place of origin, he stated the reasons for his appeal, saying that he was currently studying in the Literature Department of Chi Chih University in Jiangwan, and had never committed a crime before. The claim that he had enslaved someone was simply not true. Lai Fa was taken in because his father was</p>
<p>very poor. Lai Fa was fostered in my home. At that time, I was studying in Shanghai, and my father took him in. The next year, the child's father came to borrow 17 yuan, and a note was written. He also presented a red paper note (which stated that the note was written by Chu Along, because his eldest son Xingguan was sick and had no money for treatment, so he asked Young Master Zhong to borrow 17 yuan, with no interest, to be repaid in five years. It was signed Chu Along on the first day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar in the 23rd year of the Republic of China). As for the injury, I did not beat him. The child was very naughty and playful, and was injured falling down the stairs.</p>
<p>The opium smoking paraphernalia was used by my father in the past, so it was not discarded. I sometimes had stomach problems and occasionally used it. He also stated that the child's father, Chu Along, came to Shanghai yesterday and was also in court today, requesting to be summoned, etc. Then the witness, the child Chu Lai Fa, was summoned to the front, stating he was forty-four years old, a chef from Pinghu. Lai Fa is my son. Because of poverty, I entrusted him to a tailor named Cai Wanshun to introduce him to the Zhong family. At that time, I did not take any money. I borrowed 17 yuan from Young Master because my eldest son was sick. I came to Shanghai to visit the child after learning about this incident. The rest of his words</p>
<p>were all to protect the appellant's words. But the child suddenly sobbed when he saw his father standing beside him. When asked why he was crying, he did not answer a word. The judge examined the forensic report, which listed in detail the injuries on the victim's body. Based on this, he questioned Zhong. Zhong flatly denied the injury, but the child said that he was beaten with the rattan on the table. The judge then angrily said to the appellant, "You are an educated person with high intelligence, how can you be so inhumane!" At this point, the court believed that the facts of the case were clear, and immediately ordered closing arguments, and then announced the adjournment, setting the sentence to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 14th. The appellant was still released on his original bail.</p>

<p>The tomb of Mi Fu of the Song Dynasty, located next to Helin Temple in the southern suburbs of Zhenjiang, had not been rebuilt for hundreds of years after the Ming Dynasty repair. It was extremely desolate. When Magistrate Ye Zhendong of Shanghai County served in Zhenjiang, he requested permission from the Construction Department to rebuild it. Subsequently, Liu Yongnian, Director of the Zhenjiang Construction Bureau, connected the tomb road to Xingye Road and Lin Yin Road. Magistrate Ye also used the old stone archway to inscribe the horizontal plaque "Tomb of Mi Fu, Vice Minister of Rites of the Song Dynasty," and hung a couplet: "The soil is enough for a thousand autumns, Xuanhe's literature and history, Xiangyang's brush; The forest is only a few mu, the Song Dynasty's official residence, the Mi family's mountain," to commemorate the relics of the past.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Shanghai's Rubber Industry <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Compiled by the China Credit Information Service</p>
<p>(I) Origin and Development: The rubber industry in our country is also one of the emerging industries. It started in Guangzhou and flourished in Shanghai. Gradually, Shanghai has become the center of these factories. Therefore, when discussing the rise and fall of the rubber industry, focusing solely on Shanghai can represent the overall situation. The Guangdong Brothers Rubber Company can be considered the pioneer of this industry in the country. It was established in Henan, Guangzhou, in the sixth year of the Republic (now with three factories in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shanghai) and was founded by overseas Chinese who returned from Nanyang. Next was the rubber workshop of the Jiangwan Model Factory, which opened in the ninth year of the Republic. At that time, this industry did not attract much attention, and the factory was later closed due to financial difficulties. It was not until the sixteenth year of the Republic that the Yichang Rubber Factory, now Zhentai, was established. The following year, the Da Zhonghua Factory rose up with a grand scale, leading the industry today. Since then, numerous factories, no less than fifty or sixty, sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain in the following three years. After the Shenyang Incident and the Shanghai Incident, the number of newly established factories gradually decreased. Occasionally, there were relocations, mostly reorganizations and takeovers. Recently, closures and shutdowns have been frequently heard, and it seems there are hardly any new startups. Therefore, we can divide the rubber industry in Shanghai into three periods: the years after the opening of the Da Zhonghua Factory were the heyday of the rubber industry; after the Shenyang and Shanghai Incidents, the market declined, and the purchasing power of both urban and rural areas decreased simultaneously. With many businesses in the same industry, overproduction forced them to lower prices to sell. They competed against each other, and those with larger capital could still survive, while smaller ones were inevitably eliminated. Thus, one fell after another, and dangerous situations were frequently seen. This was the struggling period of the industry. Lately, the national economy has become increasingly depleted, and Japanese goods have been dumped in large quantities. Even when the prices of domestic products dropped below cost, they could not compete. As a last resort, they could only shut down or go bankrupt, which has reached the point of extreme decline.</p>
<p>(II) Existing Factories: According to the latest survey, the rubber factories currently operating in Shanghai include Nanhua, Da Zhongguo, Yonghe, Da Zhonghua, Jiaotong, Zhongguo Gongshang Yiji, Yisheng, Da Zhongyang, Zhentai Xinfei, Hongda, Daan, Shijie, Yiyuan, Da Zhongxingji, Dalu, Shanghai Baoye, Huaxing, Yichang, Huatong, Zhengda, Yongda, Da Shanghai, Minsheng, Chunhua Faji, Yihe, Xie Kang, Liya, Dasheng, Yongmao, etc., totaling twenty-nine factories. Those temporarily closed include Guangdong Brothers, Nanyang, Deyuan, Huashang, etc., totaling four factories. Those officially declared closed include Dayong, Dade, Italy, Dalai, Daxin, Jiangnan, etc., totaling six factories. Those still in preparation and not yet opened include Zhabei and Huanqiu, totaling two factories. Among those still operating and temporarily closed, the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory has the largest scope, with a capital of 2 million national currency. The capital of other factories ranges from 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, with the most common being around 50,000 yuan. In terms of organizational structure, most of the earliest ones were sole proprietorships or partnerships. Later, the situation changed, and many new establishments were limited liability companies, and there were also examples of old ones changing to company organizations. This is because it is easier to concentrate talent and capital, and the investors bear less responsibility. This is a general trend in industry and commerce, not just in this industry.</p>
<p>(III) Raw Materials: As mentioned earlier, except for Da Zhonghua, the capital of Shanghai's rubber factories is not sufficient. Therefore, the supply of raw materials completely depends on external sources. Even for Da Zhonghua, which has the largest scope, only the main raw materials such as calcium carbonate, zinc oxide powder, and dyeing materials can be self-supplied. It is not easy to obtain even a nail or thread like foreign shoe factories without relying on external sources. However, there are many types of raw materials. Although they are obtained from outside the factory, they are not entirely imported goods. Among them, some are produced domestically, such as calcium carbonate from Shanghai Shunchang Stone Powder Factory, Zhaoxin Chemical Company, and Xingye Chemical Factory; magnesium carbonate from Ningbo Wufeng Factory and Zhenjiang Family Industry Cooperative; zinc oxide from Shanghai Dafeng Industrial Raw Materials Company; linseed oil from Shanghai Kailin Paint Company; and linings produced by various weaving factories. However, the basic raw material, rubber, organic vulcanization accelerators, and various colors of pigments still depend on foreign goods. Therefore, since the implementation of the new currency system, the products of this industry have once declared price increases, because the cost of raw materials is affected by foreign exchange, which led to this situation. Among the various foreign raw materials, rubber is mainly handled by the Horan Rubber Company and Hoshing Foreign Firm, while pigments are mainly handled by Defu and Inner Door Foreign Firms. Gasoline is mainly supplied by Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, Texaco, and Guanghua. Other items are also supplied by Lulin Foreign Firm and Hao Hua Company, etc.</p>

<p>Next annual meeting to be held in Jinan; resolution to establish a Guangdong branch in Guangzhou</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) The opening of the 12th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society in Guangdong was reported yesterday. The annual meeting was held for three consecutive days before closing. On the fourth day, attendees toured various scenic spots. On the fifth day, a banquet was held to thank local communities. By the end of the year, members had departed from Guangdong. The most important matters decided at the annual meeting were the discussion of members' papers, the location of the next annual meeting, and the organization of a Guangdong branch. It was decided that the next annual meeting would be held in Jinan, Shandong. The establishment of the Guangdong branch was also approved by the congress and entrusted to Hu Jixian, Ling Ji, Huang Yuanbin, Zheng Yanfen, Huang Yinfu, Huang Dianyuan, and other Guangdong members to be responsible for the preparations. Guangdong members have drafted the bylaws and methods for soliciting members for the branch. It is planned to start soliciting Guangdong branch members in January. The most important paper presented at this annual meeting was Liu Dajun's "Economic Control Policies that China Should Adopt in the Future." During the discussion, member Fu Zechu proposed several supplementary opinions to the paper, namely: 1. Control should increase production; otherwise, control is meaningless. 2. Control should make consumption economical. 3. Restrictions should increase prices to make them suitable. 4. Government procurement should be based on economic rationalization. The majority of the members decided that the above points were necessary additions. In addition, the papers presented in recent days include He Haoruo's "Conditions for National Defense Economic Construction," Huang Yuanbin's "China's Exchange Rate Method After Concentrating Silver Reserves," Gu Jigao's "China's New Monetary Policy and International Economic Equilibrium," Yao Qingsan's "Several Opinions on the Central Bank," Zhang Naiqi's "Economic Policy and National Liberation," Tang Qingzeng's "Observing China's Future Economic Policies from History," Dong Xiujia's "Highway Policy," Li Quanshi's "Discussion on China's Tariff Policy," Zhu Tongjiu's "Review of Land Policy and Critique of the Land Village Ownership System," Chen Changheng's "Monetary and Banking Policies that China Should Adopt in the Future," Tong Zhi's "Land Finance Policies that China Should Adopt in the Future," and Wu Kenyuan's "Lectures on the Results of Discussions at the Nanjing and Wuhan Members' Symposium." There were also more than ten other papers that could not be discussed due to the agenda. They will be published in the society's quarterly journal in the future. The annual meeting concluded at 11:00 a.m. on the 28th, without a closing ceremony. In the following two days, members attended banquets hosted by various schools and organizations, or visited factories or toured. On the 30th, at 12:00 noon, the Chinese Economic Society hosted a banquet at the city guesthouse in the name of the Chinese Economic Society to thank all sectors. Representatives from various agencies, organizations, and schools attended the banquet that day. During the banquet, President Liu Dajun delivered a speech, representing all members to express gratitude to local organizations and agencies for their hospitality. Then, President Junlu of Zhongda University delivered a speech, raising the following questions: 1. Should China's current situation provoke the Chinese people to resist foreign wars? 2. How should the dumping of foreign goods be restricted? 3. The problem of low production education. Mr. Yun's speech lasted for an hour before everyone took their seats. The banquet was very enjoyable and ended at around 2:00 p.m. On the 31st, all members</p>

<p>— Written by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"I didn't! I didn't!" Niede cried, his head buried in his knees, because in the many eyes that were staring at him, he felt the suspicion and displeasure expressed there, which was really unbearable.</p>
<p>"I hope you didn't." Mr. Pei said, paused for a moment, as if to give the criminal, whoever he was, another chance to confess, but no one spoke, only a few children's sympathetic sighs broke the boring silence. Mr. Pei then shook his head and said regretfully:</p>
<p>"Then now there is no other way to think about it, I only have one sentence to say: that is, I don't want to mention this matter again, I want you all to follow my example. I certainly can't expect you to treat the person you suspect, whoever he is, as well as before this matter was discovered, but I do hope and wish you not to give the suspected person the slightest bit of suffering—he has suffered enough already. Now everyone, do your homework."</p>
<p>So they took out their books, while Nada said to Aimi in a low voice: "Uncle Pei is too forgiving of Niede."</p>
<p>"Don't be verbose." Aimi roared at him, feeling that this matter had tarnished the honor of them all.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>Bond Market Weakens and Recovers</p>
<p>Positive Six Twenty-Three Gains Over One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock exchange market initially continued to weaken, but soon rebounded. No. 23, although still selling, was surrounded by bullish forces, and the market price weakened and recovered. No. 4 and No. 11 were bought the most, but sellers were also quite enthusiastic. In terms of the market situation, the bullish forces were quite keen to raise prices, as there were previous long positions that had been suppressed. The bearish forces sold off at high prices, without suppressing the market, which shows that the bullish forces were anxious, while the bearish forces were calm. Although the future may slightly improve, it will be difficult to continue to rise. In terms of environmental news, the North China incident has not yet been resolved, and the talk of reducing interest rates on deposits has made the financial community guard against further cash flight, making it difficult to boost morale. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a weak atmosphere, and No. 23's selling pressure was extremely high. Numbers 34 and 54 also saw selling. Although Numbers 4 and 11 had a strong appetite, they were unable to struggle, and the market price uniformly weakened. The military cuts plummeted by eight jiao, and the rest fell by a small three, five jiao to seven jiao. In the second round, the top ranks still felt sluggish, and the military cuts continued to fall by another four and a half jiao. After entering, they gradually strengthened, as No. 23 temporarily stopped selling, and the back ranks rose by one or two jiao to half a yuan. After the afternoon opening, although the military cuts recovered by six jiao, the 19th checkpoint still fell by a small one or two jiao. After this, Numbers 2, 4, and 11 continued to have a strong appetite, and the rise was very strong. Gold shorts suddenly improved by seven and a half jiao. At the close, retail investors covered shorts and made scattered purchases, which was extremely lively. The market price rose again by one or two jiao to half a jiao, except for 96, which fell by a small one jiao. As a result, the market price mostly increased by two or five jiao, except for military cuts, which fell by about four or five jiao. However, the 23rd checkpoint rose sharply by one yuan, and the positive six improved the most by one yuan and one jiao. The results of the increase or decrease are compared in the table on the left.</p>
<p>Chaotic New York Stock Market</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (6th) the New York stock market was mixed and slightly down. The government's budget and the Supreme Court's ruling on the Agricultural Adjustment Act were announced at the same time, leaving speculators at a loss. Trading was extremely active, and prices diverged, with extreme fluctuations. The market opened fairly flat, and rose back high by noon, led by utility stocks. After the announcement of the Agricultural Adjustment Act's ruling, stocks and goods advanced in unison. Taking advantage of the rise, bullish forces sold off in droves, and prices were suppressed again. Trading gradually quieted down before the close. Several stocks rebounded from their lows. The public generally viewed the government's budget proposal as positive, but the calculations were overturned after the announcement of the Agricultural Adjustment Act's ruling. Companies that benefited from the cancellation of the handling fee were able to maintain some of their price gains. However, railways, automobiles, mail-order stores, and agricultural implements were quite sluggish. The small exchange market was mixed, and trading was quite active. The bond market moved in and out smoothly, and prices fell slightly. The total trading volume for the day was 3.73 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<p>Three Products Report a Decline</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton Suffer Another Setback</p>
<p>Futures Are Especially Weak</p>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, with the situation tight in the near term and stable in the far term. This is because the end of the overall settlement period is approaching, and the January futures yarn is nearing the Lunar New Year, and has already been brought forward six times, changed to the 20th, so trading is smoother. The majority of the psychology of the futures is bearish, and Gengfeng's bullish forces are releasing large quantities of files, making the market weaker.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Gengfeng Bullish Forces Release Files</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened in the morning, and the market situation was still scattered, and the virtual wind of the previous day had not subsided. The near months were flat, and the far months saw weakness. After the second round, Osaka's three products yarn telegrams showed a continuous decline. The original text stated that spot business was lacking and falling. By the close, it was heard that Sichuan, Changsha, inland and other gangs were entering, and retail investors were taking advantage of the low prices to make up for the losses and rise slightly. However, Gengfeng's bullish forces came out in large numbers, and the market was oppressed. As a result, each month's standard yarn fell by 8 jiao to 1.13 yuan compared to the previous day's close. After the afternoon opening, the market situation continued to be sluggish, and Changfeng's bullish forces also came to release files, and the market chips were still loose, mostly because of the poor three products yarn market. By the close, near-month short covering returned tight, and as a result, each month rebounded by 1.4.6 jiao compared to the morning close, but the June period fell by 5 jiao. 4,700 bales were sold by Gengfeng, 1,550 bales by Yuan, 1,800 bales by Dachangcheng, 500 bales by Changfeng, 400 bales by Tongfu, 500 bales by Minghua, 300 bales by Shenji, and 500 bales by Runkang. 1,400 bales were bought by Hexing, 550 bales by Jinchang, 350 bales by Shenyi, 500 bales by Senkang, 500 bales by Shenji, 1,550 bales by Yichang, 550 bales by Yongda, 650 bales by Xincheng, 750 bales by Yuda, 450 bales by Gengfeng, and 400 bales by Taichang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Hunan and Sichuan Gangs Purchase Spot Yarn</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still developed, and the Sichuan and Hunan gangs are purchasing diligently. The inland is also not bad. The total number of bales purchased by each gang throughout the day is 1,852, and the market is firm. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>The cotton market continues to fall, and the situation is getting weaker. The fact is that the US cotton trend is sluggish, Indian cotton merchants and operators are selling, and the market is getting weaker. However, US merchants are still buying, and Japanese merchants are selling exclusively, so the two are equalized. The current cotton mill demand is still good, but the market is still sluggish.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Sell Uninterruptedly</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened in the morning. Due to the poor US cotton market, the market fluctuated up and down 3 to 10 points, Indian cotton fell 2 Robbie 25, and the standard gold trend hovered. The market is still bleak. The first round of each month saw setbacks, and the second round of decline was even more intense. The market was quite virtual, because Japanese merchants sold three products of cotton, and the market continued to decline. The popularity was further hit, but the current month did not move. US merchants purchased far-month, and each month fell by 1.2.3.4 jiao compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening was still not good, because the spot cotton business was calm, and Yuan Yi Changhe continued to sell, and the market was even more frustrated. As a result, the near month did not move, and the far month fell by 5 fen to 1.5 jiao. 1,900 dan was sold by Gengfeng, 3,900 dan by Yuan Yi, 1,800 dan by Dachangcheng, 1,400 dan by Tonghe, 3,400 dan by Changhe, 1,500 dan by Changyu, 1,200 dan by Shenji, 1,000 dan by Yichang, and 1,000 dan by Changfeng. 1,300 dan was bought by Dafu, 1,100 dan by Hexing, 3,700 dan by Taichang, 2,500 dan by Yichang, 4,200 dan by Xincheng, 1,200 dan by Tongfeng, 1,200 dan by Runkang, 1,100 dan by Shengyuan, and 1,100 dan by Yuanxingchang. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Mill Appetite Expands</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption has suddenly become smooth, with 1,600 bales of Yao cotton and 2,100 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>US Cotton Market Fluctuation Up and Down</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was uncertain. Both sides were engaged in settlement as the High Court's ruling was imminent (according to the ruling), and then the industry and brokers were active in buying, and the market price rose sharply. However, some parties believed that this ruling was beneficial to the sellers, and at the same time, the bulls settled and the South sold short, and the price fell again. The industry was confused, and after a brief excitement of buying, there was a tendency to consider the words of the ruling. At the close, the short covering was still firm, and the spot price rose by 5 points, the near-month rose by 3 to 6 points, and the far month fell by 6 points. The Cotton Exchange estimated that the worldwide cotton consumption in November was 2,261,000 bales, compared with 2,256,000 bales in the same period last year. British cotton spot fell 2 points, futures fell 1 to 3 points, Indian cotton merchants and operators sold, and European exporters slightly bought, with Pingguoer falling 1.25 Robbie, Aomula falling 2 to 2.25 Robbie, and Zi Luoxi falling 2 Robbie. The original telegram is recorded on the left (6th telegram).</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening forecast for the 7th Bai Luoxi flower was 216 Robbie, down half a Robbie from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Last Week's Rangoon Cotton Export Volume</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai on the 6th, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 910 bales, all to Hamburg.</p>
<p>Tianjin Yarn and Cotton Are Quite Active</p>
<p>The Tianjin cotton yarn market has an unusual upturn, and business in the Northeast is very active, and the market is booming. The prices and packages of Tianjin spot yarn sold are listed below (the unified tax for opening yarn is included):</p>
<p>Also, cotton sales are becoming increasingly good, with 540 bales of coarse velvet cotton sold, and Japanese merchants purchased smoothly, and 2,700 bales of fine velvet cotton were sold. The cotton inventory there is a total of 138,510 bales of coarse and fine velvet cotton, of which 71,787 bales are coarse velvet cotton and 65,723 bales are fine velvet cotton.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<p>Factories Rarely Sell and Flour Prices Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market uniformly presented a good image, and foreign wheat quotations were Chicago small eight points to two or three corners, and Canada good four points. When the price opened, the market did not show any lag due to the small foreign wheat, because the current sales were not very strong, but the factory chips were not abundant. In this silence, the goods were rarely sold, so the foreign buyers turned active again, so the opening price increased by one point and zero. When the afternoon market opened, the market was very firm, and the short positions were covered again, so the market flew very high, with transactions of more than 300,000 bales, and each month was close to the previous morning's point. In June, the new flour also increased by two or three points due to the factory's low output and the market's old residence.</p>
<p>Futures and Spot Wheat Are Consistently Solid</p>
<p>However, There Is Still No Improvement In Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was stable in the afternoon, and although foreign wheat was weak, there were very few short positions in the market, and the buying air was slightly tight, and it was easy to hold up. The morning trading was very quiet, and the price was good two or three minutes. When the afternoon market opened, there was still no improvement in trading, but because the flour market was high, the market was brought to a halt, and the quotations for each month were one or two minutes. After the afternoon rise, it will be transformed into the flour market. The spot wheat market is still stable. There is no abundance of deposits on the market, and the factory taste is also very flat. The opening of the river wheat is four yuan nine corners, and the Xianghu wheat is four yuan four corners seven fen, a total of four thousand bags, and the city office went to do it.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat, if prices rise again, flour sales will be purchased in large quantities, and the estimated supply reduction last week was approximately 1.587 million bushels, with Canada's reduction being 971,000 bushels.</p>
<p>Du Geng continued to be firm and glutinous rice remained stable</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 40 Ji Qun brands arrived at the various gangs, (totaling over 9,000 dan of goods), the retail sales were still active, and 3,000 bags were wrapped, so the market saw a show. If the price of thick early Geng increased by several minutes to one corner, the thin rice middle section was superior, rising by nine minutes, and the high material only increased by three minutes. The Du Yang Jian brought high near one corner, and the Yin Bian Yuan goods were scarce and the market was fixed.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday was overcast and rainy, with 47 or 48 sources of the river down the road, and there were very few white gengs on the market for the shopkeepers, resulting in light retailing, and the hoarding households lacked transactions, and the market was soft. Early rice and thin rice were stable, and there was limited appetite for Yang Jian passenger and Bai Yuan, and the price did not rise or fall, and the price of other goods was peaceful.</p>
<p>(Passenger Xian) Arrivals are still surging, but only the actual sales outlets in this street remain, and the hoarding by the warehouses in this street has also stopped. The rising winds have ceased, and the market is in a stable position, but the back taste of this street is still strong, and the passenger hoarding may need to be asked again, so the market can still insist and will not immediately plummet. The total daily opening was 4,360 bags of Gan rice, 646 bags of Xiang rice, 400 bags of Shashi machine rice, 1,526 bags of Wen Yongtai rice, and 200 bags of Min late rice, all processed by the street. The foreign rice stocks arrived were small, and the trade had persisted for a long time. The rice merchant opened yesterday with a small each of 100 bags, and the price was one or two corners lower than last month.</p>
<p>Foreign Sesame Opened at Eleven Yuan Eight</p>
<p>Soybeans Have Inland Oil Mills</p>
<p>Office</p>
<p>Foreign sesame, because the sales market is not prosperous, the market is less excited. The standards have been raised for nearly two days, and the market has stabilized. Foreign firms have slightly traded two or three hundred tons, so the market has risen slightly by five fen compared to the price of the year. Yesterday, 200 tons were traded at a price of 11 yuan and 8 corners, still ordered for February delivery. The way to sell soybeans, in addition to the factories in this city, has many inland car factories. Therefore, the market is tight in the stability, and the number of transactions has surged to more than 7,000 bags, and the other Zha beans, Du beans, and Shahuang sales are also lively, and the Wen Tai Guang Gangs in this street deal with more than 2,000 bags of each bean, and the market will therefore be raised by three or four minutes.</p>

<p>North-South Goods</p>
<p>There Is Not Much Stock of Dried Lychee</p>
<p>Recently, such as Jinshan Zhi and Lanzhu Zhi, etc., there have been no more arrivals of dried lychee, and the number of goods will also be exhausted. Therefore, although it is now the time of light sales, the market is hard to see hard, and it is found that the number of Lanzhu Zhi has been cut off, and the goods are also limited, and it has increased by two or three yuan. The Jinshan Zhi number is thin, and the market is also tight, such as the spring sales starting, and it is expected to be good.</p>
<p>Silk Tea</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk Transport to the United States Has Increased Slightly</p>

<p>Thirty-Two to Thirty Victory Over Guoguang – Group A Pirates and Xie Xing Win –</p>
<p>Yesterday's Western Youth Basketball Tournament featured two Group A matches, both one-sided affairs. The situation between Hujiang and the Pirates was far from expected. When the Pirates scored fifteen points, Huang Lifu of Hujiang finally opened the scoring. The first half ended with a score of thirty-three to eight. In the second half, the Pirates casually coasted, and Hujiang began to show some improvement. The final score was fifty-four to thirty. The match between Qingguang and Xie Xing also lacked competition. Xie Xing, with its strong players and energetic spirit, became more and more vigorous as the game progressed, while Qingguang paled in comparison. The first half ended with a score of thirty-nine to ten. The final score was sixty-two to thirty. The Group B match between Guoguang and Mai Ling was a de facto final, with fierce competition. The first half ended in a tie at fourteen to fourteen. The final score saw Mai Ling emerge victorious with thirty-two to thirty. Guoguang suffered a narrow defeat by two points.

<p>(Tokyo Correspondent) Japan's radical advancement in sports technology this year cannot be ignored. For example, in gymnastics, at last year's student sports meet, Keio University of Tokyo independently sent a team of eight apparatus gymnasts to Europe. Even Germany, traditionally strong in gymnastics, was overwhelmed, and the Japanese team won the championship. Their intense training and technological advancements are truly astonishing. At the sports performance conference hosted by the Tokyo Youth Association last month, this reporter personally attended and witnessed athletes who would be attending the World Games performing various techniques. The mastery of their movements and the ingenuity of their routines cannot be compared to those who merely talk the talk. It is said that there are over a hundred candidates for the World Games representative team in calisthenics. They plan to concentrate them in the spring, conduct special training, and then select the final team.</p>
<p>The Japanese winter athlete delegation attending the Games has already departed in batches on the 21st, traveling through Siberia to Europe via Fengtian. However, fifteen ski athletes will depart on the 24th. On the afternoon of the 21st, the delegation's General Manager, Hirota, and the President of the All-Japan Ski Federation, Inada, accompanied the team to pay their respects to Prince Asaka and Prince Chichibu. The ceremony was extremely solemn.</p>
<p>The ice hockey representative team departed on the afternoon of the 21st. En route to Kyoto, they had a practice match against a Kyoto mixed team as a send-off. The result was a decisive victory for the representative team, with a score of fourteen to one. The crew members of the two rowing representative teams, from the Imperial University and Meiji University, held a first public practice and social gathering on Shiratori Island on the afternoon of the 21st. They also trained in the waters between Choshi and Shiratori Island on the 27th and 29th, respectively, which was their last practice of the year. Afterwards, they will go to Sahara for joint training.</p>
<p>Other athletes in various ball sports, track and field, swimming, and other events will all gather in Nagoya and other places in the early spring for joint training. With their excellent skills in each event, they all harbor ambitions to win medals at the upcoming Berlin Games. Our country's sports community, listen to this!</p>
