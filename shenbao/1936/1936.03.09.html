<h3>墨索里尼爲什麽要戰爭</h3>
<p>— Loius　Fisher作賓符譯</p>
<p>殺氣籠罩下的歐局觀察之四　（中）</p>
<p>在羅馬，那意大利帝國主義的歌手非常多，而且都振振有辭。「我們是一個年靑的國家，」他們說：「法西斯蒂才喚起了我們的力量。只是意大利很貧窮。人口又擁擠得不堪，我們不能聽憑永久的處在困厄之中而不想掙扎。外國，尤共是美國，現在都拒絕我們的移民，在從前，向外移民不但可以减輕人口的壓迫，，而且還可有大量的財富匯回祖國。加之，關稅璧壘的高築，又限制了我們的輸出；世界的恐慌更加深這種形勢的困難。我們必須爲我們的過剩人口，爲我們的貨物，爲我們的勞力，找求出路！」</p>
<p>但是爲什麽法西斯蒂一定要把對外發展奉爲信條呢？難道對內發展是不可能的嗎？這個問題曾由墨索里尼回答過，他不時又回復到他現在所吾决的早年硏究馬克斯主義時的理論。在一九二七年五月廿六日下院的演說中，他說：</p>
<p>諸位，要使意大利成爲强有力的國家，她必須在二十世紀的下半期有六千萬的人口。你們一定要問：「六千萬這許多的人口怎麽能容納在這個國境中呢？」但是在一八一五年意大利還只有一千六百萬的人口時，也有過同樣的責難。那時侯恐怕也有好多人相信在我們的疆界中要傷現在這樣容　四千萬人口而且在更高的生活標準下簡直是沒</p>
<p>有辦法的吧。</p>
<p>黑衣相從沒有過更聰明的言辭。這種反馬爾薩斯的學說已爲各國的經騐所證實了。正同意大利的人口，沒有殖民地的帮助，在一百十二年中由一千六百萬增加到四千萬一樣，那全世界的人口因着資本主義生產量的增大和公衆衛生的改善（這也是由於生產量增大的系數）的結果，也有了大量的增加。對於這一繼續不斷的發展，可曾發生什麽阻礙呢</p>
<p>我拿了這個問題去問意大利農業部長羅索尼，値得注意的他是大法西斯十八人會議的會員。談話完畢後我把他的言辭紀錄下來交他簽了字。他最先講到意大利農業的進步，她的小麥的收穫，以及每一公頃的多量生產。在原則上我們同意小農的各自墾殖是比替在大地主工作可有更大的收穫，而且可僱用更多的人工。於是我對他說：一你們現在是獨裁的。爲什麽不把土地化爲國有呢，」？「獨裁」，那部長答道，「是政治上的事，不是經濟上或社會上的事。我們不能從大地主手中把土地收回。我們也不能代定我們向地主收買的地價。在意大利所定的地價跟法國美國和其他各國是沒有兩樣的。我們將依照過去的程序收買未經開墾的荒地。如果地主願意將全部地產出賣，那是對的；如果他只願出賣一部分而留餘下的自己墾植，那也是對的。那些農夫收受了地主出賣的土地耍經過十五年到二十年的時間才能償淸。有時他們成爲地主的共同種植者。這樣我們五年以後可開墾二百萬公頃的荒地分配給四十萬的農戶。法西斯政府正爲那些新的居民準備住宅，設備和牲畜呢。他們在二十年中也可以償還了。」</p>
<p>這種辦法一定是弛緩而不適當的，因爲牠在政府的財政上加上了一筆重大的負担。許多地主以虛構的高價出賣他們全部或部分地產而暴富了。而且，也有許多的農民在那困難的新事業的開端，不敢貿然担負這樣巨大的債務。也許就是爲了這個緣故，「人口稠密」的意大利還有許多尙待開墾的荒地吧。據去年十二月七日羅馬敎的日報所載各省的法西斯農民協會領袖在羅馬開會要求七地分配。我於是堅持着，對羅索尼說，「你們要補救意大利人口的過剩爲什麽不打國內的土地改良入手，而偏要征服阿比西尼亞呢？」</p>
<p>「戰爭」，他回答說，「也許是有經濟原因的，但是主要的原因却還是道德的和政治的。法國獲得殖民地並不是因爲她的人口過剩，英國也是這樣。經濟問題雖屬重耍，可是國家也不能單獨地依附經濟條件而存在。意大利在文化方面將有新的貢獻。一種新的制度一定能改良阿比西尼亞的現狀的。墨索里尼已手創了一個負有文化使命的新國家。」</p>
<p>這些話不能使我滿足，於是我又說道：「你們是獨裁的，你能把人民送到戰塲上去或者呌他們死。你們却爲什麽不能把地主所有的荒蕪的田地拿來給農民呢？」</p>
<p>羅索尼先生，使我發生很大的興味，他也以一樣坦直的態度回答着：「那就是所謂奸雄政治啊。農人們是一定要有指導的。「把土地給農民」，那不過是一句話罷啊！那應該要有組織的。然而我們是法西斯主義者，不是社會主義者。」但羅索尼原是跟墨索里尼一樣常彼稱爲社會主義者和工人的。這使我對這次會談感到特別有興味。隨後我們又談到關於合作社的事情。他說：「意大利的合作社是由資本家技術家和工人組合起來的。技術家責在創造並指導實業。他們必不許作爲資本家的工具，他們必須領導工人。技術家實是工人和僱主間的橋樑，（這些使我想起了美國的「推克諾克拉西」制工人自己是沒有執行能力的，如果他有才幹，他便以昇到資本家的水平綫上。我知道社會主義的領袖，當他們發現了自己的才能時，便去和資本家站在一起了。工人們應該好好地組織起來，別讓他們自由放縱。罷工是一種愚笨的舉動。我不是布爾喬亞。我們是反布爾喬亞的。」</p>
<p>墨索里尼是合作部的總長。而實際上總長是由决長拉底尼代理着。拉底尼也曾和我隨意談到合作社的性質。他肯定地說：「合作社要想在廠主和工人之間找一個共同的立塲，可是結果廠卞還有廠主，工人還是工人。……合作社的制度不是友資本主義的。」這最後一句話他說了好幾决，並想設法證明牠，爲了要使我相信。</p>

<h3>德議訂不侵約　荷蘭處之冷淡　仍維持中立傳統政策</h3>
<p>荷京　德國元首希特勒建議、遜精荷蘭祟加締結不侵倏的、此間對之置若罔聞、美聯社訪員自消息靈通方面得悉、荷蘭大概不致接受此項建議、惟願襯續遵守其完全獨立及完全中立之傳梳政策公州七日國民電）</p>
<h3>莫斯科之重視　認德此舉威脅歐洲和平</h3>
<p>莫斯科穗國希特勸元首廢北羅卡諾公的、并進兵佔領萊茵河非武裝區域之援、此間政界方面、以為此共所為、縱將既成事實加以確認、亦必發生重大影饗、際茲東京發生事雄、舉世徬穆、意大利既為意阿爭端所筆制、怯國眾議院又復改選在即、希特勒乃悍然不顧、而破壞現行條的、實即一糧敲詐行為、未可漠然視之、要之時局如何演他、當以英國政府態度為轉移云、（八日哈兀斯電）</p>
<p>莫斯科吠界對於希特動演說宣佈派兵佔據萊茵地不設軍備區域及否認洛迦諾公的之舉、尚未加以評論、惟非政界為希氏此舉、志在恫嚇伕國不批淮互助協定、但料犢氏之演說結果將共反偽該協定終可保由法國批准、至氏所倡和平之說、及締結互不侵略公的之議編眾覺不屑嚴重注意、因德國之片面吾認其義務、已層見疊出、而非守信之國也、觀察家對於希氏演說听睡很嚇抬階克主義等、殊為不安、以為德國有對俄作戰之志也、（七臼路透電）</p>
<p>莫斯科曉京人士、聞訊之餘、深為震動、成認此舉、足以危害歐洲和平、負責方面以為、希特動提出建議嗡當由昆鄰各國、締結互不侵氾條的、而對於捷克國、并無一語及之、共對於捷克、別有懷抱、自可推測而知、綠捷克業與俄國綸有互助條的也、（八滷哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國不受影響　表示不欲與聞歐洲事　紐約軍用品股票騰漲</h3>
<p>華盛頓官方今日聲稱、歐洲方面因德國廢棄羅卡諾條的所引起之爭端、對禁美國並無影饗、據稱德美和的中、並無類於凡爾賽和的第三嶔之條文、故美國政府大概將絕不卑聞因德國重新駐兵萊茵河區所引起之緊張局勢云（七日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓政府對德國宣布廢止羅卡諾公的及進佔萊茵地事、未即有何反饗、故今日一般觀察家對於此事、亦未加以肯定之批評、但觀察家之意見、以為希特劫之舉動、實為直接對沃挑戰、此間人士以為法國決不致接受穗國所倡談判互不侵肥公的之議云、（七日路透覽）</p>
<p>紐約今日此問得希特載決意廢且羅卡諾公的及進兵萊茵地消息援、物品交易所之軍用品股稟買風在熾、飛機公司之股稟價格騰漲不已、而法國佛郎則幾跌二磅有奇、（七日路透爾）</p>
<h3>英法報紙評論</h3>
<p>倫敦觀察報評論德國吾認洛迦諾公的派兵進佔萊茵地之舉動、謂希特勒已將一九三五年二月英伕綏靖垂歐建議之成續、完畢抹煞、吾人對此當具冷靜之頭腦、公正之胸襟、英國第一需要、首先修治其國防之缺陷、决為以同情與好意之精神考慮希特勒之建議、希特勒所提出之新要點、為國聯盟的不得與凡爾賽和的相混淆、萊茵地應誠實承韶共完全屬於德國、而不加以妨礙、希氏此二點殊為正當、今非有基本之公道與常識，助無和平之可莖誠、屋期時雜謂先兵而援薇、仍為普魯士　歲主義可佩的原則、曦戰前穗外交部之外凌手婉已將此轉成瀉國際壇玷、但此舉使任何國際親警為之枯萎、希特動所倡之全部制度、今眞視共他各國對於德國守的之價任而定其成敗、希氏目前之行動、已於此信任加一賈大打擊，但並非教命的打盤、此點須平心靜氣以權衡之、但在權衛之際、不難想見自一九三二年以還歐洲最危險之風潮中、昨臼之事端實為最嚴重最可驚且恐為不能挽回之一慕萬、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦德國一兀首希特常魔北羅卡諾公的、並向各簽字國銀議另訂蜘載之機，壯間各報所作評論極不一致、黑期快報觀察報人民報是期紀事報均以為前途未始無望、前財政大臣史諾登頃在星期快報發表一文、略謂「希特勒所發表之演說、已使歐洲局勢為之改觀、歐洲各國人民對於希特勒所提建議、未可任人加以漠視、共或如以拒絕、惟一應付之伙、厥在立即召開歐洲會議、覓求解抉之道、」著作家吉白斯爵士則在星期紀事報發表論文、略謂「希特勒此决所為、係以一種新希望給予人類、共所提出之七項原則、亦以和平精神為歸宿、此項原則若能予以接受、則世界各國所有恐懼心理均當一掃而空、反之、如或予以峻拒、則對於全人類乃係一種罪行也云云、（八甘哈瓦期電）</p>

<p>右派小巴黎人報稱、「時局已到嚴重關頭、各國人民當知之、而希特撾所建議各節、亦未可遽信其有誠意、」</p>
<p>右派日報載稱、「英伕意三國現已威受離間策略之影響、不無互相齟齬之處、希特勒廢止羅卡諾公的之舉、乃突然發生、歐洲各國原以維持歐洲治安為風志之集團、或因而重行團結亦一幸事、</p>
<p>左派事業報載稱、德國所謂重返國聯會、究以何種態度出之、殊不可知、「羅卡諾公的簽字各國此際對於德國廢的行為、應即予以答復、不可稍存姑息」、</p>
<p>左派社會黨人民報載稱、德國廢的行為、應由日內瓦予以答復、世界和平已瀕絕境、惟有英法俄三國始能予以保垂、極左派共產黨人道報則謂羅卡諾公的簽字各國對於希特勒所提建議、當堅抉予以拒絕以云、（八日哈瓦斯社吩巴</p>

<p>南斯拉夫此間政界人士對於德國政府廢止羅卡諾公的之舉、拒不加以評論、南國政府頃待該公的各簽字國有所表示之援、始乃抉定態度、（八甘陪瓦電社斯）縫克官編人士無所批評、情魚，通人士則稱、注俱兩國鑰結互助公的之舉、未可由穗國引為咸實而片面廢止羅卡瞞公的、輿國官聯人上、因德國一兀餐聆躺黨屆翻表之澹設、弁未澤戲奧國、不顯加以評論、奪顯等痔羅卡諾公的各簽字國之反應、匈國官傷人士、對於德國兄首希特動所發表之演說、弁不表示鸞異、反馴假槍國廢止擁卡諾公的之舉、實與飼國有利、黃切魚國嚴製修正機荊韭農媾和條的之要求、可於此畢、得一進矛故也、（八日吟兀斯電）</p>

<h3>軍部態度强硬　日本新內閣難產　廣田寺內繼續進行折衝　組閣工作成敗未可逆料</h3>
<p>東京日本今日雖騰開會議、內閣迄未產田、廣田首相午前與其所礙羅致入閣之諸人會商良久、午援又接見拒長陸軍之寺內與擬任海相之永野、傍晚應陸與政界各領袖赴廣田腐所、密談四小時互換意見、定明甘再行集議、屆時或可决定內閣人選、海陸軍領袖今陣已各自開會、討論其應採之態度、（八甘路透腎）</p>
<p>東京廣田外相與寺內永野兩大將之重要會議、自八日午後三時四十分至七時五十分、達四小時有奇伐對於時局之認識、畢竟彼此之意見尚未達到完全一致之境地、組閣工作亦未得到任何進展、故移至明日再行討論、寺內永野兩大將訂於九日午前九時復與廣田外相會見、（八日同盟社靄）</p>
<p>東京自昨日廣田寺內再會見援、形勢已呈好轉之組閣工作、共從因軍部態度逐漸硬化、全面的吾認廣田內閣之空氣比較濃厚、致寺內大將亦不得不追隨、故今日之第三决會見突然逆轉、將顛落至最惡之惰勢、（八甘電通甫）</p>
<p>東京自今日下午三時四十分開始之廣田外相與寺內永野兩大將等之會見、至七時五十五分方告終、寺內大將於辭出時面色似芸緊張、其時對記者謂、余猶未接受陸相、明日此狀態或仍機續、至於是吾抉裂抑或組閣成功、前途猶難逆睹、（八日電通電）</p>
<h3>陸軍幹部　要人往來頻繁　寺內永野偕訪廣田</h3>

<p>變更之閣員人選既無新味、又無積極味、係糊塗的偽瞞的、　如斯人選難望袒當非常時、</p>
<p>一方陸軍省及參謀本部方面超越人選問題、以為廣田外相之梱人態度乃一種擬裝、而為企圖徽續抑制陸軍、在現下非常時欲一新國政之勢力之自由主義、故頗瞋不滿、若廣田外相之態度認識及人選不根本趁更、則問題之解抉恐不可能、（八日胃通電）</p>
<p>東京廣田外相與寺內大聽之會見、孵陸軍部內對於組閣方針之要求、大致已經明白表示、故央計根據陸軍方面之要求、將組閣方針加以變更、其决則以集合於紐閣本部之吉田·永田·馬壩·川崎·小原等人、以廣田外相為中心、經長時問協議之結果、大致怏定如左、</p>

<p>內務大臣須以政黨以外之人物充之、</p>

<h3>漢粵紀行（四）</h3>
<p>— 趙君豪</p>
<p>（本報記者旅行通信）</p>
<p>在南嶽與凌局長談話</p>
<p>五日晨九時，余儕仍乘手搖車自第七總段出發，至淥河大橋，渡河後，更步行里許，方達停車之處。車係株韶局自製之車，乃以鋼板貨車改裝而成，座位均為橫列，淸　簡單，切於實用，車行後，異常平穩，與京滬路初無二致。沿途掛接石子車，需時較長，故行駛稍緩，凭　外矚，湘江烟水，一望迷茫，時有茂林修竹，　眼而逝，風景之美妙，如在錢塘江上。一時許，達衡山站，尚無月台，仍以扶梯下車。下車後卽乘竹輿，向南嶽進發，一路溪光山色，宛然雲棲道上。行的二十分鐘，至湘江江邊，以竹輿置舟中渡江，仍乘之前進，再的半小時，始至湘省公路衡山站，自此以汽車循公路前進，湘省公路，四通八達，夙馳盛譽，卽此短程，彌覺穩適矣。三時許，抵中國旅行社南嶽招待所，預定於今夜在此休息。四時許，株韶段工程局局長凌鴻勛氏，因公赴長沙，過招待所小憇，因得晤談。余以工程方面之事，為社會人士所不易知者，因舉普通問題相詢，茲略誌如决：</p>
<p>粵漢路現分湘鄂株韶及廣韶三段，為世人所共知，三段併計，共長若干公里？</p>
<p>自廣州黃沙站起，至武昌徐家棚站止，共長一千零九十六公里。</p>
<p>將來如全綫整個通車，自廣州至武昌，應需幾小時？</p>
<p>粵漢路此平漢路尚短一百餘公里，如全綫通車，當需三十餘小時。惟特別快車，須經過一年後，方可開行。</p>
<p>株韶段對於客車之設備如何？</p>
<p>已向英國訂購新客車五套，的今年十一月可到。每套客車中均有頭二三等臥車及飯車，車內一切設備，係最新式者，大致與津浦路藍鋼車相仿。至於普通客車，則湘鄂廣韶兩段，各以其原來車輛，開行區間車。</p>
<p>機車訂購多少輛？</p>
<p>向英國訂購大機車二十四輛，均係最新之四八四式，每車拖力一千噸，至速度在平地每小時可走六十公里，現在已運到十輛。</p>
<p>與平漢路聯運之計畫如何？</p>
<p>擬仿照津浦京滬聯運辦法，在漢口，武昌間計畫長江輪渡。</p>
<p>株韶段最艱鉅之工事如何？</p>
<p>在郴州與樂昌間，凡一百二十公里之長，共地為長江與珠江之分水嶺，地形崎嶇特甚，崗巒錯雜，溪澗迂迴，中間亘以高低不一之大小山脈，蜿蜒縱橫，趨向無定，故勘定此段路錢，最為困難，據據英國人測量，至少須闢山洞六十六個，但經本局縝密研究，减至十四個山洞，如照英國人計畫施工，恐至現在還不能完竣。</p>
<p>施工期內，有無匪患？</p>
<p>二十三年八月至十一月間，朱毛大隊共匪，的七八萬人，自江西竄入湘境，本路公事房被毀三處，有工程師二人，監工一人被綁，後工程師逃歸，監工亦幸釋放，惟本路工程終因是停頓至二月之久。但最戚困難者，共時湘省集中糧食與現洋，本路工人數萬，無錢無食，何以為生，故調度異常困苦，所幸工人大半為北方人，未曾散開。</p>
<p>工人均來自北方歟？</p>
<p>吾，土方工人，多就地徵工，均為湘人，架橋工人，來自上海，其餘舖軌及做橋墩等等，以北方人為最多。</p>
<p>工人最多時有多少人？現在多少人？</p>
<p>二十四年工作最緊張時間，有工人十八萬人，現在有六萬人左右。</p>
<p>此路完成後，對於中國交通上，究竟有若干影響？</p>
<p>最要緊者，廣東至內地，向無陸路，只有水路，取道香港，一切受共鎮斷，甚至商家交易，均以港洋為本位。將來粵漢路通行，廣東大商家，可與內地接觸，而內地之出產，如四川，廣西，貴州等省以及長江各地之土貨，均可由此路出口，以湖南一省土產而論，關係允為重要。湖南出產桐油，去年値二千萬，佔出口額第一位，將來由粵漢路運出，何等便利。</p>
<p>華中華北一帶及長江上游旅客，往昔赴粵，必取道上海，航海以行，此後當取道此路矣。惟上海一帶之旅客，如不乘海輪赴粵，溯江西上，從粵漢路南下，不知經濟及時間，比較乘海輪如何？</p>
<p>車價絕對不貴，至於時間，則本路全綫，需時不過三十餘小時，似亦無若何影響。惟自滬至漢之輪船，如何縮短時間，是又另一問題矣。</p>
<p>全路通車後，車票價格如何？</p>
<p>三等車的定為十四元左右。</p>
<p>珠韶段全部完工，共用欵項若干？</p>
<p>現欵計國幣三千八百餘萬，料欵一百六十四萬鎊。</p>
<p>開工以後，僱用洋員計劃吾？</p>
<p>工程無一個外國人，包工亦無一個外國人。</p>
<p>將來全路以貨運抑以客運為主，株韶段收支預計，能吾相抵？</p>
<p>自以貨運為主。株韶段收支方面預計至三十年後，可望將債務淸償。本路建築欵項，係借自中英庚欵董事會，有契約規定，將來營業收入，只許用百分之六十五，其餘均用以還債。</p>
<p>株韶段究竟何時可以接軌？現在工程是吾告竣？</p>
<p>截至二月底止，　土石方完成百分之九十八。　隧道已完工。　禦土墻及小橋涵渠已完工。　大橋完成百分之九十二。　舖軌工程，全段四百〇五公里，已舖三百四十一公里，現祇餘六十四公里。本年五月十五日接軌，當不致有誤。</p>
<p>株韶段預定何時完工？現在縮短若干時？</p>
<p>二十二年七月，鐵道都與中英庚欵董事會簽訂借欵合同後，始大舉動工，當時預定四年完成，應為明年六月間接軌。現在自開工時計算，至五月間接軌，計共三十五個月，較原定四年，提前一年一月，換言之，卽四年計畫，以三年完成之而已。</p>
<p>余與凌局長談話半小時，深以此項鉅大工程，外界不及詳知為憾，凌謂本人實事求是，施工時期，朝夕忙迫，但求早日完成，其他均非所計，故實在情狀，非到路勘視後，不易明瞭云云，凌局長談畢，仍乘車前進，余是夕宿南嶽招待所，明日上午游山，午後赴衡陽。</p>
<p>記者又按株韶段自本年一月一日起已開區間車，計分三段，　自株州至衡山，　衡州至棲鳳渡，　坪石至樂昌，惟此車係工程車，僅掛三等客車一輛，在車上售票。</p>
<p>至粵漢路全路，由武昌至長沙，乘湘鄂車，中段由長沙至坪石，乘公共汽車，坪石至樂昌乘株韶車，樂昌至廣州，乘廣韶車，亦可由漢口直達廣州，惟途中須歷時三日夜耳。</p>

<h3>美國提倡節育家　山額夫人昨午抵滬　今晨原輪赴檀香山　馬丁夫人亦將續來</h3>
<p>美國節育家馬格利德山額夫人MargaetSanger此决重作世界之遊、道經印度、作多决演講後、於上月到港、因酬酢及感冒數度展期來滬、現已於六日、在港乘昌興輪船公司日本皇后號輪啟程北來、該輪於昨日下午一時碇泊公和祥碼頭、夫人在滬勾留一宵、明晨原輪東航、茲誌各情如决、</p>
<p>昨日抵滬</p>
<p>山額夫人　承該輪輪一〇七　號頭等艙、同行者僅有其秘書費立潑小姐、夫人年的四十許、衣黑色常服、豹皮大衣、因病後面色似不甚健康、但其行動舉止、猶不失為一婦女運動家之本色夫人原定在上海作一度演講、惟現已作罷、定今晨仍乘原船東航、擬往檀香山小遊、昨日因為國際婦女節、原擬往碼頭歡迎者、均因參加集會未到、僅有婦女節制會周鍾慧卿及顏福慶率其女公子前往迎迓、</p>
<p>節育理由</p>
<p>據山額夫人語中央社記者、本人提倡節育、肇自一九一四年、自一九一六年至今歲、此二十年中、固無日不以提倡節育爲職志、惟世人對本人主張、不甚明瞭者、頗多不諒、甚至有人起而反對、實則本人節育主張、亦有其七大原因在、　使患有隱病或花柳病者免遺傳、　　婦女之患肺病胃病及心病者、免受孕後卽難醫治　　使身體表面甚健康之男女、免生育愚蠢之兒童、　使健康婦女、得有生產與生產間之休息、以保其健康、　經濟能力僅能養育若干（如一二）子女者、不使過多此數、使父母及子女兩受痛苦、　若干男女發育未全而實行兩性生活者、可避免生育不健强兒童、　在新婚以後、兩性間尚未深切了解者、應避免生育、以减少家庭紛爭、總之、本人主張决非絕對節制生育、而為視每一家庭情形而節制生育子女數量、</p>
<p>節育方法</p>
<p>至於節有方法、大別有三、　卽絕對節制生育、消滅婚姻、　永久避孕、　用各種科學方法節育、所有節育方法、均由醫生指導、</p>
<p>登岸赴宴</p>
<p>山額夫人及其女秘書費立潑女士、由周鍾慧卿引導登岸後、卽乘祥生汽車赴白利南路王逸慧醫生寓所之茶會、到者有顏福慶。駱傅華。周鍾慧卿。周自培夫人·梁福連女士·胡竹君·吳景奇夫人等、均係醫生及研究節制生育者、晚宴後、始登輪、待今晨八時啟椗、（按據另一消息、山額夫人、九月間將再來華、）</p>

<h3>江浙沿江海魚商　請發公債救濟</h3>
<p>臚陳振興漁業要點多端魚產每年可獲萬餘萬</p>
<p>申時社訊、本市漁輪業同業公會、上海魚市塲籌備委員會、寧波旅滬同鄉會委員長虞和德、定海旅滬同鄉會委員長劉鴻生、以及蘇省常熟·鹽城·南通·崇明·南匯·東台·松江·海門·等沿江海二十餘縣漁會等、以我國沿江海各省市地方人民、直接間接恃漁業為生者、不下千餘萬人、每年漁產價値達三萬萬元以上、近年農商凋敝、社會金融枯竭、漁村組織亦隨之崩潰、如果不籌商救濟辦法、則將來不特漁船不能出海作業、益將任外輪任意侵漁、危害地方安甯、影響社會經濟、故紛起呈請實業財政兩部、特請中央發行漁業公債、或妥謀一根本救濟之方、茲探誌各漁會及各公團所擬辦法及意見如次、</p>
<p>浙省漁業經濟狀況</p>
<p>浙省定海漁業、冠於全國、而沈家門地方、允為漁民薈萃之區、每屆冬汛、有大對船一千二百餘對、放洋採捕、每對生產平均以五千元計算、統計所獲、不下六百萬元、惟在放洋之先、必須籌集漁本、如人工。船租。柴米。桐油。蔴拷。繩網等物、每大對船需用漁本一千五百元、共計的需一百八十餘萬元、此項漁本、向由甬沈兩地銀錢兩業、貸予漁棧、再由漁棧轉貸漁民、俟漁獲物售出後、算還本息、已成慣例、</p>
<p>公團集商貸款救濟</p>
<p>邇來銀錢兩業、因遭受現社會不景氣影響、金融停滯、放欽緊縮、漁棧無從周轉、漁汛因而坐失、數百萬元之漁作生產、遺棄海中、數十萬戶貧苦漁民、末由生活、甚至為飢寒所迫、淪為海盜、流禍地方、故經各公團集商之下、擬仿照財部救濟工商業辦法、請中央籌撥公債、或漁業公債二百萬元、組織貸欵基金保管會、貸予漁商、貸放期間、限定一年、暫以黃花魚生產金三百萬元為保證金、到期由魚棧負責收回貸放之時、除以市區動產不動產為抵押品外、並取殷實舖保、務使基金穩固、欵不虛糜、</p>
<p>貸款漁民不憂損失</p>
<p>又各地漁會等、則主張請由政府就已發行之公債、或準備待發之何項公欵項下、提撥數百萬元、分存辦理農村貸欵之各銀行、貸給漁民、以作漁船出海捕漁之資本、至於漁村生活、不比農民安定、每歲出海漁船、不免間有遇風遇盜之險、此類損失、貸欵者當謀抵償、此則擬請財部於鹽稅項下、每擔加收一角、或九分、以便抵補漁民貸欵損失之用、此蓋為救濟之穩妥辦法、且可為漁民貸欵者、保留一信用之立塲、</p>
<p>護漁弭盜有賴海關</p>
<p>關於漁業衰落之總因、固不僅漁撈方面之一端、卽如運輪製造等等、亦極關重要、似亦應由政府設法救濟、方能謀澈底之振興、擬請政府仿照水災附加辦法、於海關水產物進口稅項下、帶徵附加百分之一二、以作沿海漁村振欵、以作救濟及改進漁業技術之用、如此、則不特漁民旣可安居樂業、利賴滋生、亦卽無形中消　海盜、維護沿海貿易安全、海關諒亦樂予贊助、聞財實兩部、以如上所陳、純爲現時救濟漁業之切要方策、故庸派員會同計劃辦法云、</p>

<p>通告各用戶</p>
<p>逕啟者、據本會委員酈　奎君建議、以每具電話機、均須負祖基本話費、商店五元五角、住宅三元五角之多、譬如某一弄內、計有電話十具、此十家茍能合用一具、拆去九具、便可减少基本話費三十一元五角、而十家商店、减裝一具、更可節省基本話費四十九元五角之多、以此項節省之費用、專門僱一司話人員、自屬綽有餘裕、等情到會、查此項方法、實足以為一時權宜之計、相應函請貴用戶、與臨近鄰居、磋商節省辦法、便宜行事、為荷云云、</p>

<h3>全浙公會建議　糧食自給自食</h3>
<p>昨呈行政院貢獻辦法三項　農民無力施肥請根本救濟</p>
<p>本埠全浙公會、昨呈國民政府行政院文云、國民政府行政院鈞鑒、我國</p>
<p>以農立國</p>
<p>民食向賴自給、民國初元、尚有餘米出售、供給鄰邦、乃自近年以來、糧食漸感不足、每年輸入米麥甚鉅、據海關報告、去年食糧進口、達一萬五千五百九十一萬餘元之多、佔入超總額十分之四、殊堪驚駭、若不帶籌補救、在平時開此大宗　　、難以期國際收支之平衡、設遇非常事變、海上交通或遭阻塞、則米麥來源斷絕、都市居民、恐將</p>
<p>盡成餓殍</p>
<p>軍糈　成問題、瞻念前途、危險莫有甚於此者、當今米糧之缺乏、決非由於食之者眾、探索其　結所在、水旱偏災、固為原因之一、然民國二十一、二十二、兩年、各省均告豐收、何以米麥仍有進口、可見最大原因、實在農村破產、農民無力施肥、良田漸成　　、產量因之銳減、查全國</p>
<p>水田旱田</p>
<p>總計有十三萬三千二百餘萬畝、以七成種稻麥估計、假使每畝少收一斗、積算共少九千餘萬石、無怪昔盈而今絀、根本經濟之道、應以科學方法、改良種籽·農具·肥料·及管理、不難使產量倍增、通盤計劃、每畝貸以五元、供上述各項改良之用、便需六十七萬萬元、屬會前曾建議六全大會、請發行鈔票五十萬萬元、救濟農村、非好為大言也、倘以</p>
<p>幣制改革</p>
<p>之初、通貨　形膨脹、深恐引起社會之恐慌、似可暫行治標之策、先就水田部份、按畝貸以約值二元之肥料、據老農經騐、每畝施豆餅一枚、可增收糙米五斗、全國水田共有三萬三千餘萬畝、總計可增一萬六千餘萬石、今每年所缺者、不滿二千萬石、一轉移間、便可變不足為有餘、足食方可足兵、自衛必先自給、事關救亡圖存大計、用敢不揣譾陋、</p>
<p>謹擬辦法</p>
<p>如下、　貸欵總額、定為六萬五千萬元、按各省水田、除東四省及新疆鞭長莫及不計外、共有水田三萬二千七百餘萬畝、每畝貸以二元、需欵如上數　所需欵項以左列各欵充之　中國農民銀行新發行鈔幣一萬萬元、　撥復興公債二萬五千萬元、抵換中央銀行鈔票、　中國農民銀行發行農民流通券二萬萬元、此項流通券加蓋地名、限於當地使用、不能直接</p>
<p>購置外匯</p>
<p>但須每年收回一次、　貸欵方法、一、購買人造肥料、照原價與農民、二、農民自辦天然肥料、如河泥·水草·人糞·獸骨·之類、按其所需之本、貸以現欵、（其詳細辦法、請採用褚輔成所著貨幣革命第五節第九欵之貸欵辦法）、際此國難日亟、民族存亡之秋、屬會認為救國之根本大計、莫急於增加農民生產、謹此提呈建議、務祈採納施行、不勝切迫待命之至、上海全浙公會叩、</p>

<h3>世界貿易漸趨繁榮之檢討</h3>
<p>— 王乃賡</p>
<p>與我國今後之對外貿易</p>
<p>世界貿易轉好之朕兆</p>
<p>二三年來，各國國內經濟因一時無從恢復，以致世界貿易現象，依然萎縮。至去年（一九五年）第三四季，世界之貿易趨勢，已漸有回復轉好之兆。據德國之帝國統計局調查，（以五十二國之外國貿易折換馬克計算）去年第三四季之世界貿易總額為二百十七億馬克，比前年同期增三億馬克，的增百分之一·九。又據國際聯盟之調查，（以七十六國之外國貿易而折換法郞計算者）亦的增百分之二·四。茲將帝國統計局與國際聯盟之調查列表於后：</p>
<p>世界貿易價額指數（以一九二九年為基數）</p>
<p>前年　法郞指數　馬克指數第一季　三四·〇　三三·五第二季　三三·五　三三·九</p>
<p>第三季　三三·九　三三·三</p>
<p>第四季　三五·九　三五·〇去年（一九三五年）</p>
<p>第一季　三三·一　三二·三第二季　三三·四　三二·二第三季　三三·七　三二·七</p>
<p>此種貿易轉好之現象，據德國景氣研究所之新指數所示，（占世界總貿易額百分之九〇以上之三十五國調查所得）同樣比較，增加百分之六·三。若以上列一九二九年為基數之新指數觀之，則世界貿易目一九三二年之第三季之四二·四至三五年之第三季之五二·二，已回復百分之二三·一。然自一九二九年之水準觀之，則猶止百分之四七·九，其全體之回復，則為期尙遠。</p>
<p>工業國貿易發展新姿態　　去年第三季世界貿易轉好之趨向，若就工業國與農業國之類別以論其發展傾向，略有不同。姑先將工業國從歐洲與非歐洲之兩方面觀察之，以見外國貿易之為如何。</p>
<p>歐洲之工業各國，在一九三五年之上半年，幾全呈普遍增加之勢。例如英國，斯堪第那維亞諸國，奥大利，及捷克斯拉夫等國，其國外貿易皆有相當改善之跡可尋；他方金集團諸國（法，荷，瑞士及至一九三五年三月止之比利士）之貿易，因國內之經濟狀况繼續惡化，及意，德因國外滙兌之困難日漸加重，所以其貿易狀况略呈减退。但從大貨上觀察，則歐洲工業各國之國外貿易似在决第增加也。</p>
<p>去年第二季以來，在歐洲之工業國，曾幾經重要之變化，第一，為比利士之截止平價，該國自三月底之平價截止後，其國外貿易，顯著增加。例如比國之輸出入合計額與前年同期之比較，第一季减少百分之九·三，第二季即增百分之二二·八，至第三季已增加百分之三二·八。第二，德國之外國貿易自一九三四年以來，幾處於入超常態，至三五年五月以降，即轉為輸出增輸入减之結果。其出超額已自第三季後逐漸增加。最後即為意大利，因與阿國紛爭結果，其貿易允其是軍需品之輸入，顯著增加。其另一例為美國之對意貿易，一九三五年一月以降之十個月貿易為五千五百萬金元，與前年同期比較，增加百分之八·三。不僅此也，對南非之意國殖民地之輸出，其變動有更足驚人者，在同期間已自二十五萬四千萬金元增至三百五十九萬七千萬余元，為十六倍以上之激增。僅十月一個月，石油對意之輸出，自三四年十月之三十四萬增至百七十萬元，銅之輸出自十九萬增至五十五萬元，飛機且自四千激增至二十萬金元。</p>
<p>以上各種變動，歐洲工業國之外國貿易，除金集團諸國之貿易依然萎縮外，其餘入第三季以來，大體是增加的。茲列表如左：</p>
<p>其次，歐洲以外之工業國對外貿易，亦同樣在邁步發展中，日本之外國貿易，在已往四年中已連續的上昇，去年尤為顯著，母待說明。美國之外國貿易，因係承一九三三年及三四年之輸出極度激增之後，所以至三五年反轉輸入增加之態，以致形成其一月以降之十一個月之原有出超，一變為自三四年之四億三千九百萬元至三五年激减為一億九千七百萬金元。美國輸入之所以增加，農產品係因國內旱荒，致使農產物收成减少，原料品輸入增加，則係年來景氣回復，國內產業界需要增加所致。至輸入之增加，即製造品亦所不免，允其為上述國內景氣之回復，為其更大之一因，促成比利士，瑞典等之與其他各國締結新通商條約，即其一例。</p>
<p>農業國之外國貿易趨勢</p>
<p>農業國之國外貿易，亦可與工業國同樣的以歐洲與非歐洲分別觀察之。</p>
<p>歐洲農業國之外國貿易，除丹麥始終陷於不振外，其他如英國，西班牙，波蘭，及巴爾幹諸國，在一九三三年三四年因輸人累有增加，而輸出亦仍然减退，結果入超增加，所以此等國家之金融係，亦會一度陷於惡化，其債務方面之困難，自屬當然之事。然而自一九三五年以來，則情形轉變，就中如巴爾幹諸國及愛爾　等即得輸出增　人減之好結果，其外國貿易，顯然呈改善之氣象。匈牙利及其他二三國家，因意大利之需要增加，於是輸出步增，亦形成貿易出超之局。所以歐洲之外國貿易自三五年來已得相當回復。</p>
<p>歐洲以外農業國之外國貿易，如中國，荷印，及法領等國，至去年仍有發展之傾向。此種貿易狀態之改善，第一因工業國之景氣逐漸回復而原料品之需要增加所致，因此此等農業國之貿易亦漸見出超，債務狀態亦得以因此改善，一部分的國外匯兌於是增加，惟其如此，農業國之國際淸算能力亦為之增厚不少，因此而又往往招致大量輸入之循環結果。最近各國貿易現象，輸出方面雖然增加，而同時他方面輸入之增加更大，此其貿易趨向頗有冉人惡化之可能！另一方面之工業國如英，美，日等國之製造品輸出，反形活躍。但是此等農業國若因見於貿易狀况之日趨惡化，則其輸入，早晚必思有以使其减退，此實為世界貿易發展之一障碍，頗堪憂慮。若一究今後之農產品及原料品之價格必趨　貴之特，則此等農業國之貿易</p>
<p>大　已趨回復步調</p>
<p>從以上之說明解答，則顯然的世界貿易之所以轉好，大體上係基於工業國之景氣回復與原料市塲之活躍所致。允其是原料生產國之最近好况以觀，則對於世界貿易改善之期待，似非為過分之妄想也。良以現在農業國之輸出增加及農業地域之對於製造品購買力增加，皆為事實。而且一九三四年來美國政府新訂之貿易政策，從其足以緩和與特殊國間之貿易障碍與乎經約國之增加之一點以觀，則其予世界貿易</p>
<p>當此世界貿易正在改善之際，最近國聯諸國對意施以制裁一問題，論者頗以此種制裁足以影響世界貿易為慮，其實此種觀察，實　過慮，因意大利占世界貿易之百分率僅不過百分之三而已。加之此種制裁之程度其實行力如何，　成疑問。　相　索里尼於去年十二月卅日之閣議席上曾宜稱：「最近意大利政府與奥大利·匈牙利·瑞士·及德意志各政府之間已締結金融協定」。然則聯盟對意制裁之效果，終屬期待而已！總之，世界貿易無論其制裁之手段如何，其已徐徐步入發展之新途為無疑矣。</p>
<p>我國今後之對外貿易</p>
<p>上文所述，以我國劃入　業國這類，此雖在向來「以農立國」自號之我國，初無可非義，但一究其對外貿易之事實，則我國之僭稱為農業國，殊有愧色！因農業國與工業國之別，往往可於其對外貿易之出超與入超之商品如何以為表現。通常之貿易形態，農業國大抵以飮食物及原料為巨額的出超，而製造品為巨額的入超；工業國大抵以飮食物及原料為巨額的入超，而製造品常為巨額的出超。但我國情形則逈異於是。例如民國廿三年我國製造品之輸入為百分四九，其入超數為三〇一，三四六千元，但同時其原料及半製品之輸入亦為百分之二六，入超為九五，五三二千元，飮食物之　入亦為百分之二一，其入超為六五，七〇八千元，由此可知我國之所謂農業國，不僅製造品須仰給外國，而同時農產品亦仍須仰給於外國，大非農業國應有之常態。僅糧食一項，我國自供不足額達生產量百分之十四。自民國十年以來，每年進口洋米平均的在一千六百六十萬公担以上，去歲承前年大旱之後，各省雖豐歉不一，從大體上觀，為差吿稔熟之年，但是洋米之進口仍有一千二百九十餘萬公担之鉅，佔入口貨之首位！較前年增百分之五十二。豐年猶且如此，則其爲國家之一極　姑不論，即以一旦國家有事而言，則洋米來源告絕，其勝負之間，不待交綏，已足以制吾人之死命而有馀！此其意義，不僅為入超出超之問題，蓋亦關係民食與國防之問題也。據最近中央農業實騐所調查，全國荒地統計，有二千餘萬畝之多，此在地盡其材之一點上言，為完全未會解决。</p>
<p>所以吾人於討論貿易之入超與出超之時，應就其商品之性質及貿易之是否平衡發展以爲喜憂之標準也。吾以爲人超雖可憂，但如果其入　大部分爲機器材料等等直接或間接之生產具，則以其爲助於國內生產事業之發　故，實爲有利之入超。反之，出超雖爲可喜之現象　但如果其出超爲畸形之發展，則仍爲不　全之出超情勢。例如我國號稱以　立　，而　有制造品之鉅額出口，此項出口若眞正爲國內工業發展所致，固亦值得可　，惜乎實際上並不　然，例如民國二十三年我國出口商品以制造品爲最多，佔百分之三九，但日本在華紗廠棉紗棉布之出口，佔其中百分之七十以上。又如我國出口商品向以絲茶爲主，近牢來一變爲桐油芝蔴等易為人倣植而又無獨佔性之農業副產。又如其進出口貿易之水準若為斜趨向下之出超者，皆為不健全之出超情勢。（如本年一月份上海出口為三千七百餘萬元，入口為三千五百餘萬元，皆不及旺盛時每月入超水準四千萬元之數；又如二十二年入超為七萬萬三千三百餘萬兀，至前年即减為四萬萬九千四百餘萬元，去年更減至三萬萬四千三百馀萬元，數年來之入超水準皆爲　趨向下之勞。）</p>
<p>所以吾人以爲我國今後之對外貿易，似應採取：　力求其農業之能自給自足，允其是米·麥·棉之不假外求。　改良絲茶，桐油等特產以謀海外市塲之推廣，　一般工商業之出品應以先奪取共外貨在國內市塲之銷路為第一步，然後審度市場之需要逐漸以謀海外之出路。良以謀本國貨之暢銷於本國，本國人用本國貨，較之於外國人之用本國貨，而謀國貨之暢銷於外國，其輕而易舉，難易不同，甚為顯然。若以我國今日之國際地位及國內工商業如此凋敞之秋，欲國貨之對外輸出擴展，實爲費力多而獲利少之舉。查我國對外貿易之總值雖年趨衰落，但是其入口貨物與入超數景仍甚鉅，足見國內之銷行力沿強，此在貨暢其流，物　其用之一點上言，幾完全未會做到。</p>
<p>雖然，去年十二月份全國貿易出超五百餘萬元，本年一月出超九百七十餘萬元，其為數雖微，然而以歷年處於入超地位之我國言，則此種轉換貿易形態之繼續發見，無論其為新貨幣政策之影響或為國民購買力之薄弱所致，要不失為値得注意，或足以興奮產業之事態。</p>
<h3>中國貿易出超原因之探索</h3>
<p>— 莫湮</p>
<p>出超的結果好壞</p>
<p>幣制改革之後的二個月，即去年的十二月份與今年的一月份，我國貿易史上竟開了六十年來出超的新紀錄。據海館報告，十二月份的出超數為五百萬元，出口總數為七〇·五七五·七二八元，較去年十一月份及前年俱增。至於人口方面比上有及去年同期均減。又一月份之出超額雖略見減少，亦沿達一百三十九萬元之多，這一事實不能不說是關關以來的廳蹟。</p>
<p>什麽原因使得貿易出超，這一問題固然需要研究；同時出超之後，對於我國經濟上有些影響，是好的方面多呢，還是壤的方面多，這個問題也是値得吾人注意的。</p>
<p>就一般的意義上說來，似乎貿易出超則國際的收支得能平衡，同時因輪出激增則產業例能發達，而促進國民經濟的繁榮。並且在幣制改革之後，有許多人都認為從此之後，因我國幣値跌落關係，我國商品只能在海外屯併，因此經濟上昇可以計日以待。似乎現在貿易的出超是合了這個預言。可是事實並不如此簡單，在輸出貿易品上去分析，則這二個月的輸出品仍以農產品的桐油，棉花，絲茶為主，而輸入的商品仍是礦砂金屬品紙，煤油等為主要品。這表示我國民族工業並無轉機的現象，同時農產品的輸出，究竟有多少利益給農民，也是成問題的。而最顯著的惡影響，到是關稅收入因此大减，這是有最重要的關係。下面先來討論一下出超的原因，然後再來談到出超後的諸影響。</p>
<p>貿易出超的原因</p>
<p>我國近二月來貿易的出超原因，旣是因為輸出的增加與輸入絕對的减少所致，所以為要研究這個出超的原因不能不把輸人與輸出二方面，分開來討論。</p>
<p>第一輸入方面：——</p>
<p>根據海關出入口的統計，無疑的近幾年來輸入中國的貿易額逐年的是在激减中而去年與前年之入口額的减少更為明顯。從民國二十年以來，我們入口貿易之减少如左表：（單位為千元）</p>
<p>民國年別　輸入額　指數　　二〇　二、二三三、三七六　一〇〇·〇</p>
<p>二一　一、六三四、七二六　七三·二</p>
<p>二二　一、三四　、　六七　六〇·三</p>
<p>二二　一、二二九、六六五　四六·一</p>
<p>二四　　九一九、二一〇　四一·二　　由上表看來，可　我國從二十一年度中經濟發生恐慌以後，人中貿易額即形激減。而二十三年度與二十四年度輸入貿易之减少，仍是繼被的。蓋在一九三四年全國輸入額為十億零二千九百六十萬五千二百二十四元，但去年則僅減少約五億一千九百二十一萬元，共計減少一億一千〇四十五萬九千零元，即約減百分之十五·六强。至最近　個月來其减少之數字已如上述，足見這種减少不是純屬幣制改革之後方然，而是中國經濟恐慌以來一貫的趨勢。所以對外貿易入口量的减少其最大原因之一，不能不說是　為中國人民購買力的絕對的相對的减少所致。</p>
<p>耍證明中國人民購買力的減少問題。在輸入商品的性質上也可以得到一個證明。我們知道去年十二月份與今年一月份入口商品中估最主要地位的是金屬和礦砂。要知道金屬與礦砂的用處，用於工業上甚少，用在軍需品亦不少，軍需品之有加無已，當然誰也知道與國民生計是毫無關係的。</p>
<p>另外一個反證便是在於進口商品中米穀之進口額所佔比率甚大，蓋去年十二月份進口之總數額為二，九五七，三三〇關金元（一關金合國幣二，二六八）而米穀一項則佔四〇七，一九六關金元，即約占百分之十三·七十強。米毅進口道樣多，這第一表示中國農村的破產，故生產不足，不得不向外購米以補充之，第二，米積為人生必需品，故米穀之進口增加，只能表示中國農村經濟之沒落，而不足以示人民購買力的增加。</p>
<p>第二，使人口減少另一重要原因，是中國幣制改革的前後，日體在華紗廠大大地擴充，因此紗布之進口遂見减少。日本在華棉織及紡織廠究竟擴充了若干，我們雖不得而知。但據近日報紙所傳消息，上海的日廠多改紡細紗，及擴大生產是事實。故一向占進口很重要部分之棉紗布類之减少，乃極屬可能的事。由此可以知紡織品輸入的减少，也不見得吾國的輕工業即有發展的可能。日本在華紗廠之擴大，因其可免關稅之負担，則其壓迫中國之紡織業只有加深。</p>
<p>第二，出口方面：——</p>
<p>出口方面的所以增加使得國家貿易差額順調的一個重大原因，與最近我國向美國售出大批白銀有關。據各報所載之消息，中國白銀在紐的市場拋售者的為六千萬左右云，銀子出售對於國民經濟之關係，這也是誰都知道的，用不着再說了。</p>
<p>其次在這二個月輸出品中占最主要地位的，十二月份為棉花與桐油，一月份為桐油。芝蔴·麻·絲·等等。而我國重要工業生產品之棉紗一項則僅為一百三十萬餘元，足見原料品之輸出是仍然是絕對多數，工業品之出口者眞是渺乎其微。這種情形如與輸入商品多為製成品相比較，則我國經濟的殖民地性昭然若揭了。同時桐油之輸出增加之原因，不說與各國軍備競爭有關。因為桐油應用於軍艦及軍器上的最為廣大，故吾國貿易出超與各國之軍備熱不無關係。這也是出口增多之原因。</p>
<p>再次爲許多人所重視的，我國幣制改革對於輸出關系究竟如何？亦應當加發討論的，一般學者往往認爲國中幣制改革規定了貨幣的價値後，則對外貿易因吾國幣値　定故亦能增加，同時在國外市場上，因吾國商品可以比較廉價出售，則銷路必增。前一理由，在一定條件下還有可說的道理，至於第一理由則吏有問題的。因爲吾國是一個次殖民地的國家，並不能在列强市場上允許我們有屯併的餘地，而且中國的原料根本是决定於宗主國之需要與吾，絕對不如殖民地市場上可以有競爭力量。按諸事實亦是如此，這二個月　最主要輸出品爲棉花與桐油，棉花的最主要市場是在日本與德國。道是因爲該　國根本產棉不足之故，每年需要由中國輸入棉花，並非由於一時之故。至於桐油則百分之八十以上是輸入到美國去的，原因亦因為美國無桐油之生產，一向的情形都是如此，與幣制之改革可說無甚關係。即此一端即足見並不是由競爭得來的利益。至於最有競爭可能性的商品如絲與茶葉兩項（競爭對手主要是日）輸出情形就不同了。茶葉在這二個月中間輸出量並不很多，十二月份為一，九三五，〇三七元一月為一，五八八，五三六元。占輸出品之比率並不見有增加之勢。至於絲的出口在幣制改革之前，倒曾呈過活躍之現象，但在幣制改革之後反而不見得有特別加多之事實，祗退居輸出品中之第三位。至且一月份的出口額，祇値三，一八九，三四七元，比諸十二月份値五，八五六，〇八六元的反見减少。</p>
<p>由此數端即足證明許多人的熱望是不合實際情形的。不過幻想而已！</p>
<p>給中國經濟什麼影響</p>
<p>由上面的分析，可見出超之原因是很偶然的，而且最重要點是在於國內市場的激烈縮小，故相對的呈為出超。同時許多學者一致地認為幣制改革後貿易即將出超，出超後則振興實業即可指日以待，按諸事實，亦不見得是眞理。</p>
<p>這是爲什麼呢？第一，貿易出超直接的使得關稅收入為之大减，因為關稅主嬰的來源為輸入商品，而其大宗的支出則為內外債基金及賠欵等各項用途。大家都知道公債投資是我國銀行及紙幣基金中之重要部分，債信如有動搖，則其影響於整個金融信用是如何的嚴重，這還用說明嗎？自從去年以來因關稅收入短少，每月的絀四百萬兀，這明顯地表示着中國財政基礎與國民經濟的矛盾。因為繩以常例，出超似乎是國內生產的增加，但是我國的情形是很特殊的，出超非但說不到有振與實業之可能，而財政却成為問題了。</p>
<p>第二，貿易出超出對於民族工業的影響怎樣呢？事實上也一樣的不如我們所祈望的有利。因為輸出品旣是廉價的原料，同時輸入的却是旣製品，這便是人家拿了我們廉價的原料做成高貴的製成品再到中國市場上來出售，一　手間我們將損失多少呢？這是誰都明白的。而且情形因出超也許要更甚一些。</p>
<p>第三，輸出的旣以農產品爲大宗，則似乎對於吾國農村有利了。相對的說來也許有些利益可說，不過我們要注意，中國出口貿易品是經過輸出商及買辦之手而輸柱海外的，農民的生產物價格能不能因輸出多而抬高呢？這是靠不住的。證之以往價格提高受其利者往往是中間商人等，這種情形現在顯然還是一樣。其决抬價格，形成不等價之交換，則促進中國農村之沒落，亦是理所必然。</p>
<p>由上述數端看來，吾國貿易忽然出超，也用不到沾沾自喜，對於國民經濟的轉變是差不多沒有什麽關係，所以决不能貿貿然下結論說貿易的出超便是中國經濟復興之象微。</p>
<p>而且這二個月的出超根據上述的原因，以後仍會有逆轉的可能，這是因為中國農產品的輸出多少是完全决定於列强經濟的發展如何，在目下世界經濟恐慌道樣慢性的惡化現象中，除了與軍需品有關之商品外，輸出要想擴大，這是毫無指望的。而且有許多商品如茶，絲，紗，棉花，小麥之類國際競爭本巳很劇烈，而列強之關稅壁壘與競爭之有力亦足以壓倒中國。中國的絲茶出口逐年減少，顯然是受日本的排斥所致，今或能不能使輸出增加道是很成問題的。</p>
<p>其次天津海關一向是輸出人之重要關口之一，華北方面某國勢力日益增長，而利用各種手段使其商品輸人激增，起來，影響吾國貿易平均的一定很大，這又是目前貿易上一個很嚴重的問題。</p>
<p>所以無論從那方面看來，這一次貿易之出超，爲我國經濟發展前途着想，均不足發樂觀，反而這正是中國經濟恐慌與殖民地化加甚過程之表現而已。</p>

<h3>街頭的孩子</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>近來我時常在靶子路，寶山路，乍浦路，湯恩路，這幾條馬路上走過的時侯，總會同樣地看見有兩個中年男女和一個纔四五歲的孩子，坐在冷僻的牆隅下，只要遇到有一個比較體面點的人走過那裏，他們便對這孩子說了一聲什麼，於是那孩子也就受了什麼傳諭似的，跑過來跟着那過路人，將一隻骯髒的小手伸了出來說：</p>
<p>「先生少爺給我一個銅板！好先生好少爺給我一個銅板……」假如你給了他一個銅板，那末他就飛也似的去交給那個中年男子或婦人—也許就是那個孩子的父母吧？—接着，他又照樣地去跟另一個過路人要了。</p>
<p>這年頭正是一切都再翻新花樣，我還記得從前走江湖的變把戲，有猴子討錢，狗兒向入跪拜的玩藝兒，這樣就可逗得看熱鬧的人發一下笑，銅板自然也會別別卜的丟了下去，固然，那走江湖的想得到，比了自己去伸手向人乞錢要有效得多，後來那些市儈們在一種營業上要想吸引主顧，或使收入豐富一點，所以也偶然會使用那類似的技巧，可是想不到如今這班討錢的，居然也想容易博得人們憐憫，而敎孩子來幹這種勾當了，這雖然也是討錢人的聰明，但我却應該爲那些不幸的孩子們憂慮，這究竟是社會敎他們這樣來幹呢？還是家庭要他們那樣幹，我相信照這樣下去，在不久之將來，社會上一定會產生一大批小呌化來。</p>
<p>沒有飯吃的，在目前的農村裏或都市裏實在太多了，只是在馬路上慷慨解囊的給幾個銅板是不濟事的，允其是在無形中去養成許多乞丐，那似乎也太不值得，所以我自己也不能明白，到底還是給他銅板好呢！還是不給的好？我有時看了只是爲這些無知的小生命悲哀！</p>
<p>末了，希望那些關心兒童敎育而在高喊着「救救孩子」的先生們，先來「救救這些街頭的孩子吧」。</p>

<p>一個晴天的下午，在馬路散步的當兒，忽地裏　聲鏜鏜由遠而近的響起來了，有些腰束白布，頭戴白帽的騎着脚踏　，在前引路；後面是一隊音樂隊，吹着喇叭，鼓聲鼕鼕的相諧和；三十二人抬着一具上面罩着繡花大紅緞棺罩的靈柩，慢慢地走着，孝子孝孫執着竹杖，涕泗滂沱的隨在柩後，產眷和來賓是坐在馬車中，隨後又有十多輛乘着汽車送葬的人，汽車後面，頭戴白帽，身穿白衣，手執綫香的送葬人，累累不知其數，這是一個富人的出殯；生前繁榮，死後亦繁榮，兩旁人山人海的看熱鬧，也在歎送這當人到天國去！</p>
<p>隔了不久的時候，富人的喪禮已全消逝了，遺下的景象是冷淸濟的，遠遠地又有二人抬着一副白森森未　過的棺材，急促的隨着富人出殯的路徑走去，後面只有一個白衣白巾白鞋的婦人，和兩個小孩子嗚咽的隨在後面，連引路的人也沒有一個，光景是凄凉極了，馬路兩旁沒有一個人圍聚而觀，遇着的人也急忙的避開，這個寂寞的死者，生前是寂寞的奮鬭，死後也是寂寞的同到地獄去！</p>

<h3>世故人情</h3>
<p>— （胡德先）</p>
<p>一般人的口頭禪，都有所謂「世故」人情」這句話，看去是兩個名詞，解釋起來，意思實在差不多。</p>
<p>常常聽到老人家批評，某某人很好，很懂得世故人情，可是我却始終懷疑着這句話，懷疑着這句話是怎樣的解釋。</p>
<p>現在我可以拿一件事來顯示，譬如有一個人提着一籃水果，拿來給你評估，買價吃虧不吃虧，當然那人要隨便取幾個給你嘗嘗，因爲這是一種人情世故，誰都是要有此一舉的。可是世界上也有些怪人，就是拿出幾個水果給你看看以後，會將它取回，提着就走。這種人，有人說：是不懂得世故人情，我認爲，並不這樣簡單，還有許多原因要我們去探究呵！</p>
<h3>漁父詞拾遺</h3>

<p>乃聞友言。。此詞計有五闋，今佚其四；渠曾於抄本中誦之錄示我曰：「釣台漁父褐爲　，兩兩三三舴艋舟：能縱棹，貫垂流，長江白浪不須憂。」「雲溪灣裹釣魚翁，舴艦爲家西復東；江上雪，沛邊風，笑看荷花不嘆窮。</p>
<p>「松江蟹舍主人歡，菰飯蒓羹亦共餐；楓葉冷，荻花乾，醉宿漁舟不覺寒。」「靑草湖中月正圓，巴陵漁父棹歌還。，釣車子，撅頭船，樂在風波不覺寒。「似較原傳一首，工力神韵，兩俱未逮；不諗是吾後人假託者。姑記之，以備考。</p>
<h3>貝葉經</h3>
<p>— 蔡蟄存</p>
<p>西藏古多貝樹，葉如芭蕉，可以代紙，寫經文每用之，又稱經文爲梵莢，宋人有「貝葉應多此處繙」之句；然貝葉經後多偽造，眞迹絕少。吾鹽提督軍門祁公子修，與海州蘇提督德海爲兒女姻親，蘇氏舊藏有古貝葉經一部。袁項城秉政時，曾懸重金購求，並派員物色至蘇府，請一觀，認爲眞迹，願出價增至五萬元，蘇氏堅不肯售。原經先曾寄存祁氏，予乘機亦往一觀，後仍歸蘇氏。貝葉計八十餘貝，其色灰黃，長的尺餘，寬的二寸餘，原只葉未必如此，想係當時加以剪裁，故能一律。葉質厚而軟，向日照之，內有細紋，絡繹如蕉扇狀，决其爲生就植物，非出自人工也。經詞係用西藏文橫寫，究竟有何用處，而寶貴若此，予固不解藏文，亦不留心內典，不敢漫加評論也。</p>

<p>我黟桃源洞下五里，地產修竹。其異處：葉葉均着墨痕雖經雨淋日炙，色皆不褪；相傳爲當日李靑蓮曾遊此地，題詩石壁，揮筆所染。又云：爲附近蘊藏煤礦所致。然以余所知，則實因該處（過此則杏）地近石墨嶺，係平日受其氣質薰染，致有此異。故李白會有句云。。「磨盡石墨岑，潯陽釣赤魚，靄峯尖似筆，堪畫不堪書」。（　山雜咏）孫簡庭亦云：「峻岑鑿重重，黟山擅勝蹟，靈氣多所鍾，於斯產墨石，石墨何以珍，文房配玉册。」…：且微州爲產墨名區，滿夷堅志。。所謂「黟歙之間，有李廷坯製墨尤佳！」查　墨之能佳，實因有天然墨石爲其作原料也。觀此則我黟桃源洞下墨痕竹葉，亦爲石墨岑之連關係，叉有何奇之可言哉？</p>
<h3>戀的主權</h3>
<p>— （徐小庭）</p>
<p>一個老頭子，仗余錢的魔力，可以戀上一個靑春少女。個老太婆，裹着鷄皮似的皮膚，却不能使小夥子施以恩愛。戀的主權，是厲於男子的，不是屬於女子的。</p>

<h3>老年痰喘</h3>
<p>— 鄧源和</p>
<p>老年之痰喘症，俗呼爲哮喘，恒發於四十歲以上之人，咳嗽喘息，防碍睡眠，其原因多由傷風得來，死亡甚多，</p>
<p>此症病理爲氣管痙攣，與小兒百日咳相仿，故須服用鎭咳除痰特效藥，舒張其痙攣，即能迅速治愈，據余臨床實騐，獨推「補肺拿爾」卓著神效，藥到病除，惟小兒百日咳，每决藥量可服半片至一片，日服三决，成人依仿單進服，迭經治愈多人，傷風作欽，允有奇騐，且此藥不但因含鱉魚熊鹿之肝肺膵荷爾蒙，以健胃增食，壯補虛弱，防治各期肺癆，並因係蛋黃素複製劑，用於煙客咳嗽及戒癮，更爲對症良藥，購時請認明「補肺拿爾」四字。原料純凈，常服且得防癆强身。</p>
<h3>營養與健康</h3>
<p>— 黎福民</p>
<p>食慾與胃納，常人多數忽視，實則危險最多，如用腦過度，過事勞動，或無故發生胃口退减，食慾不振，均爲致胃潰瘍胃癌等險症之原因，夫食慾强大，則營養佳良，終身健康，試觀農夫及勞力之人，每飯數碗，故能筋肉發達，神氣虎虎，常人欲享此種健康之福，惟有購服「强胃精」，促增胃納，如住江灣之郭金榮君，瘦弱萎黃，夢遺失眠，胃弱食少，噯酸頻頻，食後作脹，見食輒厭，每逢宴會，停箸不舉，遷延八載，迭藥難效，嗣自投余處求診，余先用德國「補體康」治愈其失眠夢遺，隨囑服「强胃精」半月，作根本治療，藥未數瓶，食量大增，血色轉紅，今事隔年半，前在杏花樓聚餐會上相值，見其狼吞虎嚥，杯盤縱橫，且壯健突過常人，被深深向余道謝不置云。</p>
<h3>肺病臨床實驗錄</h3>
<p>— 戴德</p>
<p>欬嗆痰血生機復萌</p>
<p>患者金仲持君，廿六歲，商界。病原——早歲傷於手淫，致身體困瘦，遂染肺癆。病狀——初則忽視，旣而欽嗆頻頻，痰中帶血，胸脇刺痛，腰背痠楚，失眠遣精，眩暈食少，精神萎靡，各藥罔效，因循四載，始由同事彭思、永君介紹來余處求治。處方）余診得其肺病已至第二期，非普通療法所能愈，即嚴囑購服「補肺拿爾」二星期，則欽嗆自止，血痰必瘳，同時合服德國「補體康」以治腦弱失眠，而止精洩，果獲奇效，且胃納大增，精神煥發，彼因欲赴粤經商，來余診所，即以　光檢視，肺患已愈七八，以尚未斷根，囑暫宜休養，然彼迫於生計，堅請指示旅途療養，經告以攝生法，並囑續服以上二藥，保可根治，月前忽得其自粤中來書申謝，謂愈後近三載，體重已增至—百三十五磅，雖大勞不裏倦，近將返申完婚云。盜汗欽痰　然而起</p>
<p>盜汗欬痰　然而起</p>
<p>患者兪益壽君，四十三歲，文界。病原——終日伏案，用腦旣過度，調理叉失當，致起咯血。病狀—熱高三十八度，咯血盈盂，咳嗆多痰，氣息短促，多夢少眠，心跳盜汗，身虧體削，精疲力乏，迭治雖告血止，終難根治，直至去春始投余求治。處方。處方——診斷肺有空洞，檢痰癆菌甚多，病入末期，囑亟服「補肺拿爾」，凝血退熱，而除欽痰，一方面兼服德國「補體康」，即可夜得安眠，的共服四瓶，所患盡失，沉疴霍然而起，乃囑其安心連服前藥各月餘，必保不發，以後即母須來所診療，果獲痊治，精旺神足，大勞不畏倦，大寒不畏冷，倚馬千言，曾至衛生處騐痰十餘决，確無癆菌痕跡，證明斷根，前旬以事來余處，因爲余備述如上。</p>
<h3>不孕者之喜訊</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>柏林麥克林雜誌云：女子月經失調，經來腹痛，血色黯淡，久婚不孕等症，多由女子卵巢之疾息而來，此種疾息又每見於卵巢本身之發育不全，或　　　　而致受傷，）如　淫，房事過度等）於是　胞成熟之　轉中途受其障碍，遂有子宮發育不全，及黃體與　胞缺乏或消失，或者因卵巢荷爾蒙之刺戟不足。凡此等等，均爲女子月經病及久婚不孕之主要原因，</p>
<p>關於此種療法，近來頗多主張臟器的治療，然因此種臟器製法之繁難，每多失敗。近來梅倫博士發明之荷爾蒙製劑「補女容」一藥。足彌以往缺恨。此劑係採取靑春期女性動物之　卵荷爾蒙。功能改造卵細胞，促其機能旺盛，曾歷試卵巢發育不全之動物多次，結果皆甚圓滿，遂用於人類，仍獲同一之優異效果，凡女子各種月經病及久婚不孕，神經衰弱，失眠，頭痛，眼花，腰脊　痛，白帶下等，均能一掃而除云。</p>
<h3>姚菊巖醫師淋病床報告</h3>
<p>診所：四川路寗波路轉角。診時：上午十時至下午六時</p>
<p>最難治療之淋病獲愈</p>
<p>淋病中之難以治愈者，要爲慢性之副尿道炎。</p>
<p>此症所以難根治者，良以吾人之副尿道管甚深，而其開口之小孔，又細如毛髮，淋菌一旦由後尿道中轉實此處，輕易難於擒獲，且息副尿道炎之人，其小便大多　潔，此亦使患者失於注意之一原因。但如用顯微鏡檢查，則往往有許多淋菌混入其中者，故患副尿道炎之人往往於無意中將淋菌傳染其妻子，此尤可長懼之事也。　有住河北路張壽屛君，亦患此病傳染其夫人，其夫人會服「克淋儂」治愈。但張君自信其病業已完全治愈。疑夫人之病非其傳染者。乃懇余爲之檢查，余先用顯微鏡檢查多决，其尿中果發現淋菌。復用血淸檢騐，果亦呈淋毒性反應。診察多時，始知病灶在副尿管中。乃用　線及電氣療法後。又用「克淋儂」之內服藥。前後經治一月有餘，始全部根本肅淸。再用各種剌　及血淸檢騐等方法，始終無淋毒反應。遂確保其根治也。</p>
<h3>治淋專藥　克淋儂之實驗寫眞</h3>
<p>— 文靜生</p>
<p>（一）尿道狹窄</p>
<p>患者薛永光君，住西藏路，息慢性淋已六七年，初因生活問題東西奔走，未遍根治，致病毒日深；尿道口狹窄不容一粟，故排尿異常因難，平日小便時，非用橡皮管插入不可。因此時現尿中毒癥；後始來余處治療，乃為之施用手術以排淸其索尿後，即以德國淋病聖藥「克淋儂」使其內服，二星期後，　　全消，放尿通暢，乃　其續服二星期，果獲尿色　　，約月餘而根治。聞薛君自經此次根治之後，雖房事飲酒等高度之刺　，從未再發，足證「克淋儂」功效非常藥可比，無怪其位世界著名醫院醫師一致推許可。</p>
<p>（二）尿道中有如蟻走狀</p>
<p>患奢王雲蟠君，年廿一崴，住北京路，於宿娼後之第四日，即感淋病，陰都發痒灼熱，易舉陽而遺精，睪丸腫痛，小便見血，尿意頻數，旋即尿道發腫，膿濁封口，以致排尿益感困難，即來我處治療，乃爲之行前尿道洗滌後，囑其購服「克淋儂」僅服二瓶，諸症霍然，續服三星期卽告根治。經血淸檢查，確證斷根，昨得其來函，據云愈後雖飲酒運動，逢春亦未復發，今已歷兩年，誠不勝路感云。</p>
<h3>如何回復靑春</h3>
<p>— 周有仁</p>
<p>手淫自瀆，已成兩性靑年時公開秘密，其當等於放血，靑春腺內分泌損傷，身日以殉，肌肉消瘦，或因父母血氣虧耗，房勞過度，所生子女，賦禀不足，凡此皆使身體發育不全，體格矮弱，或貌似强壯，而頭昏腦暈，未老先襄，腰痠背痛，失眠健忘，心悸貧血，皮膚蒼白而粗糙，在男子則遺精早洩，陽萎不堅，女子月經不調，白帶不孕，乳房瘦癢，此實人類日趨衰弱之原因，德國人種改良所鑒於普通內分泌製劑治療無效，乃發明採取靑春期之海狗猩猩獅虎等雌雄二性內分泌，以極科學方法分別煉成男女二大補藥「補體康」與「補女容」，最能增生靑春腺細胞，根本改造先天不足後天斵傷之衰弱機能，使肌肉壯實，皮色美嫩，於是失眠羸弱，立歸痊愈，而男性遺洩陽萎，生機短小，女性經病不育，乳部平坦，得此無不根治，又因含有大量蛋黃素，用於男女戒烟時期，斷癮迅速，並根治宿疾，免致重吸，藥內無不良劣質，若連服一月，腰背有力，精神煥發，可日行數十里不倦云，</p>
<h3>淋藥之最新大發明</h3>
<p>一月五日德讓醫學研究會，舉行全國年會，一時參加者均係德國醫界著名學者，中有淋病專家傳斯柏博士特別提出之治淋論文，全會場空氣爲之震動。據謂淋藥必須具有全身抗毒作用，若單獨局部透膜殺菌，體內他部及血中之淋菌固仍不能全滅，終難根除，惟近頃德國發明之淋病聖藥「克淋儂」，則兼有此種多方面偉效，因其初係以新鮮淋菌，注射於牛羊體內，使發生一種天然抗毒素，然後將產生此種抗毒素之類脂肪質，用特殊科學方法製爲內服片劑「克淋儂」，即以此藥液灌飲會受淋菌接種之其他牛類（即人工傳染），而取其小便以顯微鏡檢之，則見尿中混有多量自血內泌出之血球，呈游走覓食淋菌之活躍狀態，同時尿內死亡之淋菌甚多，經過一星期，該牛行血淸檢查即無淋毒性反應，百試不爽，乃投服人類之淋病患者，竟無論急慢性淋濁與睪丸關節等炎症，均能迅起透膜殺菌，發生全身抗毒偉力，迅速斷根，俾斯柏氏以此藥施治之兩千餘人中，愈後或結婚，或房勞及飲酒，無一復發，實爲最澈底之藥品云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「公理」的老家</h3>
<p>— 李汶</p>
<p>在一般人眼中，「公理」這名詞共實是不存在的，祇是騙人的東西。故有「强權卽公理」之說，常爲一般人所念誦。其實事實並不如此。佔住世界的，也並非全是强權。强權祇是很少部分。强權之外，還有廣大的好人在。所謂公理，原存在世界廣大的好人羣中；過去所謂「公理卽强權」之說，其錯誤就是要在强權中去找公理，而忘却强權外去找公理。</p>
<p>三月二日哈瓦斯社電云：各國和平主義派靑年在白爾塞爾開會，代表三十二國靑年一千二百萬人，對日本在遠東之侵略行動，提出抗議，又對於意國侵阿，提議應加緊對意制裁。這是存在於世界廣大好人羣中公理的一面。</p>
<p>再查上月二十九日紐的路透電云：美國反戰民衆在日領署前示威，「警告日本軍閥對外蒙蘇俄中國之侵略行動」，謂此種行動，「將引起數百千萬人贊助被侵略之民族」云。這是存在於世界廣大好人中公理的又一面。</p>
<p>再查上月二十五日倫敦路透電云：「上海各學校學生，前於去年十二月二十四日，舉行示威，反對華北所謂自治運動時，曾與公共租界警察發生衝突，下議院本日開會時，共產黨員伽拉却當就此事，質問艾登外相云，當時學生受傷者究有幾人，被捕者究有幾人，受傷學生年齡在十六歲以下者，又有幾人，抑英國人所控制之警察，對於中國普通人因反抗日本對華政策所舉行之示威運動，是吾有權加以取締」。這又是同情於我們的公理的一角。</p>
<p>此外，在報上屢屢看到世界同情於我們的公，理表示，歷來很多很多，記不勝記。誰說世界無公理，公理是存在於世界廣天的好人羣中。若到强盜羣中找公理，結果自然碰到一鼻子灰。</p>
<p>要接受世界同情於我們的公理也不易。「天賜黃金」，决無其事。接受公理，也必須付出必需的代價。歸根結蒂，公理還得在血中去找！</p>

<h3>病</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>——寫給以後的自己——</p>
<p>我以爲這世界光剩下自己。</p>
<p>亭子間里除了躺在床上發楞的自己，沒有別人。我眞有點發氣：如果再讓自己埋在這荒墓樣的房問里，也許便是這樣地了結了一生。亭子間里的一切，如那剝蝕得斑駁的牆壁，那堆着書和什麼零碎東西的檯子，那給一時氣憤和不小心弄番了的滿地的雜誌和舊報紙，那骯髒的不知是誰替自己蓋上的棉被，那在床前預備吐痰而又給黑色的黃色的痰塊沾染得很汚穢的報紙，那報紙上刋載着一段殺人放火之類的新聞，……諸如此類，都使自己不安和憤怒。</p>
<p>我眞想勉强支持起來毀了這一切，這一切。</p>
<p>房子一時大得象一個戈壁，戈壁里沒有水，也沒有玫瑰花。——不過，從來我便不愛玫瑰花，甚至什麼花我也不愛；同樣地從來我便沒有設備一個熱水瓶，凖備着自己有時或者需要一點什麼水的。這時候，眞有點反常了。（可以說簡直有點反常了。）我需要水，我需要玫瑰花，或者共他什麼花也好。正因爲這樣，自己所需要的，永遠是幻想，於是，才可以引起了自己過份的不能自制，和容易憤怒。</p>
<p>這時候，我相信——一點也不需要到說謊——什麼人走了進來，也許他便會得到了一個極不好的運道。因爲，我一定會瘋了一樣起來打他，很象要把自己的一切悶氣全發洩在他一個人身上似的，那才安樂。但是，我沒有那樣子做，這不特因為永遠在我的悠長的孤獨的病的時候沒有人走進來，而且，這以後我想到：我如果這樣做一定不成功，多半的原因是爲了我這時候一點力氣也沒有，少半却是爲了我馬上會後悔，不斷地後每。</p>
<p>這，爲了我明白病之所以沉重，完全是爲了留給自己去想的時間太多，使自己越發越發麻煩自己，變得更可怕，而且孤僻。</p>
<p>的確，我之所以埋怨病，完全是爲了它給予我以孤獨，把我隔離了一切人。把我關在這麼的一個可以說完全沒有空氣的房間里，讓自己仔細地整理這幾天所受到的感觸和懲罰。——</p>
<p>「我可以說，」自己又極不願意地這樣開始浸在痛苦的理想中了。「一個人如果有一件痛苦侵擾了他的時候，其餘的痛苦都會一起兒地走來找他，煩他，正如一班討債的人對於一個破產者那麼地。又很象浮士德給魔鬼迷惑了以後，完全是爲了他自己一時的不小心，以後魔鬼便沒有離開或停止騷擾了他。</p>
<p>「這一切，譬如吧。一切都拿來譬如吧，願意他永不會成為事實。——</p>
<p>「一條路，或者一件事，或者一樣什麼的，快要，也許馬上便使他得到了結果，而這結果又可以如他的願地使他得到了無上的安慰，同時這結果也是他自己最認爲少不了的和吃飯一樣重要的，也可以這樣說，這結果是他的責任，是他的途徑，或者甚麼再沒有比這更重要的。……但是，這便被失敗在一個說不出的原因里了。這痛苦是不可形容，而又不能够形容的。這些侵蝕了他，使他受着「懲罰」，者比之他的「罪」大一千倍，一萬倍。</p>
<p>「這樣，一切不如意的事都來侵擾他了，乘了這機會，可以說是千載難逢的機會。同時，一切凡他所認識的鬼魂都來麻煩他，使他沒有一個夜晚可以安寗地睡；使他沒有一個空閑的時候不想到這一切痛苦。——明顯地，當然地，一點也不會弄錯：這便是自己。」</p>
<p>這一趟，我勉强地撑持起來了。無論如何，無論那一個時候，自己也沒有想到病，或者希望過病。祇有埋怨病，詛咒病，甚至諷刺着一切在病着的朋友，而相反地自己相當跨耀着自己，象幾何公式那麼地肯定的認定自己决不會爲病累倒。</p>
<p>現在，這一切都變成了諷刺，無論一個怎樣愚蠢的，甚至以痴的人，他也不會把我誤成一個完全沒有病的健康者。雖然或者我會，甚至强迫他說出和他相反的話。，</p>
<p>忽然，也可以說是突然，自己望着自己茵哭了，而且是大聲，凄屬地笑。自已感覺到：如果不是發了瘋，便一定不會這樣糟榻自己。在病中還要茵氣的，那才是天下第一個蠢子。那里來的一股勇氣，或者可以說是給一個朋友的說話鼓勵了，扒了起來，一點兒沒有勉强，整齊的，有條理的，在把這戈壁般的亭子間改造着，使自己滿意而是舒適。</p>
<p>心里想：如果時間不容許自己作無聊的瞎想，一切病都不會侵擾。我又笑了，我聽到這笑聲是溫和的。</p>
<h3>娜拉（七）</h3>
<p>— 萬超塵忻炘合作</p>
<p>娜拉：你當眞不愛你的丈夫嗎？旣然如此，當初你爲什麽要嫁給他？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：當時我母親還在世，躺在床上不能動了。並且我還照顧兩個兄弟，所以我覺得不應該拒絕他。</p>
<p>娜拉：那時候他有錢嗎？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：日子很過得去。不過他的事業却靠不住。他死了就一敗塗地，一些東西也不曾留下。——後來我開了一爿店，立了一個小學堂，想盡方法，支撑着過日子。</p>
<p>娜拉：你一定覺得你的生活十分自由了！</p>
<p>林敦夫人：娜拉，並不見得，我但覺得說不出來的空空洞洞，活在世上並不爲了什麼人，却又不能不一天到晚的勞碌，並且因爲要活命，所以就變成自私自利，衹顧着自己了。當時我聽見你們交了好運——本你信我的話不信？——我替自己高興此替你們高興還利害。</p>
<p>娜拉：你這話怎樣講？哦，我明白了！你盼望滔佛帮你一點忙？姬婷，我一定呌他帮你的忙。</p>
<p>林敦夫人：娜拉，你待我眞好，這樣出力帮助我！况且你又是個不曾經過多少艱難困苦的人，更是格外難得。</p>
<p>娜拉：我嗎？我不曾經過多少——？</p>
<p>林敦夫人：（微笑）唔——不過懂得一點輕巧女工一類的東西。——娜拉，你還是個小孩子呢。</p>
<p>娜拉：你和他們都一樣。你們都以爲我這人是不能做什麼正經事的——</p>

<h3>青陽港的初冬（十二）</h3>
<p>— 秋原</p>
<p>——這簡直不是冬天，瞧，北方那有這景色。</p>
<p>——可不是，倒底是江南。</p>
<p>火車一站站的，從南翔，黃渡，飛了過去，將卓民及秋華在靑陽港驅逐了出來，跨越過了鐵橋，就是那鐵路所經營的花園飯店。一走進門，就看見有那中豎有石碑，刋着「蓮開並蒂」四字的荷花塘。雖則已經沒有了荷花，但就是這四個字已經够了。</p>
<p>——瞧，「蓮開並蒂」，我們到那兒，仿佛就有這種天作之合的布景。趕火車，不是只差了一點點，座位，不只騰了剛才坐的兩個，到了靑陽港，又是「蓮開並蒂」，這樣好的一塊地方就謄下我們倆個。</p>
<p>——可不是，這地方是太好了。</p>
<p>午飯是預備好了，三樣菜，一樣湯，兩個人。膳廳是那麼寂靜的。興其說這是飯店，母寗說是私人的別墅。卓民呌侍者端上了兩杯法國的Vermouth，那爽口的酒啊！只要想想，閉起眼，在寂靜的食堂裏，兩個相愛的人，一點酒，這在卓民，是怎樣的一種意外的遭際。他覺得，人的聚合是眞不可測度的。兩年前，當他初次遇見他的時候，雖然她的活躍多姿，對於他不是沒有深刻的印象，爲了友誼，爲了人情，他一點思緒也沒有，這印象早就在無可奈何中消失了。那知兩年後的今日，他們會在這幽靜的別墅裏Tete．a．tete的在一起呢！這眞是什麽也沒有辦法的，這旣不是Love　at　first　sight，又不是做的調情：他終於無法使他不得不走上這條路。在秋華，也何嘗不是如此呢？她並不一見就愛了他，她也想不到她會這樣的愛他的。然而，這又有什麼辦法，使她吾定了自己。在卓民，他覺得他的存在只是爲了秋華，除了秋華，他就彷彿沒有生了　的　　。</p>

<p>我們是人間的棄兒，</p>
<p>我們是社會上的剩餘者；</p>
<p>我們沒受過爸媽的撫愛，</p>
<p>我們沒遇着黃金的時代，</p>

<p>我們整日祗是在街頭　躅徘徊，</p>
<p>我們永違祇是飄泊在海角天涯，</p>

<h3>Expert Talks About Interest Rate Reduction</h3>
<p>Regarding the quiet issue of interest rate reduction, the Minister of Finance has entrusted the Shanghai banking industry to study it. Recently, a financial expert stated that the highest deposit interest rate for Chinese banks is 1%, and the highest loan interest rate is 1.23%. Private lending often exceeds the stipulated interest rate. At a time when rural areas are declining and industry and commerce are bankrupt, interest rate reduction is indeed an essential plan. However, reducing the loan interest rate requires a reduction in deposit interest rates as a prerequisite, and the Central Bank's rediscount rate is the root cause of the interest rate reduction problem. It is hoped that the authorities will pay attention to this. (Eighth Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Wunghsi Paper Mill Loan Problem Unresolved</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The issue of a Sino-British Boxer Indemnity loan for the Wunghsi Paper Mill is that all of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds are education funds for cultural and academic institutions and cannot be compared with ordinary commercial and financial institutions. Therefore, the loan is being investigated in all aspects, and the amount of the loan and the timing of payment will be discussed after a definite result is obtained. Furthermore, the original plan of the factory was to use water power, which is economical and effective, but after detailed inspection by experts, it was believed that the existing water power was insufficient to meet the needs, which is a question. If the factory is completed but the water power is insufficient, it will inevitably be changed to coal power, which would cause changes in the original plans. Therefore, long-term consideration is required. (Eighth Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>German Troops Enter the Rhineland</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to a European dispatch on the 7th, German troops began to enter the Rhineland area from 5:00 AM that day, and a large number of troops will be stationed there the following day. The significance of this event surpasses the Abyssinian issue of today. According to the Treaty of Versailles, the area east of the Rhine River, 50 kilometers wide, has always been designated as a demilitarized zone, in which "Germany shall not maintain or construct any fortifications" (see Article 42), nor "shall it station or permanently station any troops, nor shall it prepare for mobilization in this area" (see Article 43). Therefore, Germany's decision is a direct tearing up of the Treaty of Versailles regarding the left bank of the Rhine. What consequences will arise after the breach of contract? Please examine the various international treaties related to this. According to Article 44 of the Treaty of Versailles, "If Germany unfortunately violates the above two clauses, it shall be regarded as a hostile act against the signatory countries and a disturbance to world peace." Therefore, Germany's current action is absolutely intolerable, at least in the eyes of France. Furthermore, the Locarno Pact, signed in October 1925, has even clearer stipulations. Clause 2 states that after France and Germany agree not to invade each other, it continues, "If Articles 42 or 43 of the Treaty of Versailles are violated (such as a sudden act of aggression or the concentration of troops in the armed zone), immediate action must be taken." According to this clause, France can certainly respond to Germany with action. The article also stipulates what this action is: the implementation of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, with the action to be determined after a resolution by the General Assembly or the Council of the League of Nations. If the General Assembly or the Council of the League of Nations cannot reach a unanimous resolution, the parties involved retain the right to take necessary action according to Article 15, Paragraph 7 of the Covenant of the League of Nations (see Clause 2, Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the Locarno Pact). Therefore, regarding France's actions, it will ultimately resort to economic or military sanctions by the League of Nations or autonomous military action. This coping method has also been stipulated in the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact recently approved by the French Parliament. Therefore, if the League of Nations has no solution, France may take free action with Russia, Czechoslovakia, and other countries, which is not impossible. However, according to recent news, France's actions are still awaiting a resolution from the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Although the stipulations of the treaty may not be fully and effectively implemented, the violation of the Treaty of Versailles has not been a one-time occurrence. For example, the cancellation of reparations is inconsistent with the original stipulations of the treaty, but it was ultimately canceled due to the Lausanne Conference. Another example is Germany's military expansion, which is a direct violation of the military clauses of the treaty, but France could only cry out in vain. Britain is also a signatory country to the treaty, but its naval agreement with Germany is tantamount to helping Germany violate the military clauses of the treaty. Such so-called violations are very serious in France's eyes, but they have not triggered severe action against Germany by France. Therefore, although there are stipulations in the treaty, actual actions are not determined by international relations. Now, let us elaborate. Germany dares to send troops brazenly into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland because the international relations in Europe are too complicated. Just think about the fact that Italy's invasion of Abyssinia has been going on for five months, and various countries have not yet found an effective way to deal with it, which shows that cooperation among countries is not easy. Furthermore, since British-Italian relations have deteriorated, it is difficult to work together to deal with Germany. This is one of the difficulties in cooperating against Germany. Moreover, the British have already fallen out of favor with Italy, and it is also a noteworthy question whether they would like to fall out of favor with Germany again to increase their own difficulties and disputes. Thirdly, Italy, in a state of isolation, suddenly has a like-minded comrade, which can at least strengthen its own momentum and will naturally be happy to sympathize and echo. Britain and Italy are the main signatories of the Treaty of Versailles and the Locarno Pact, and their attitudes are so hesitant, which is unfortunate for France. Therefore, France can rely on the recently wooed Soviet Russia, but since Soviet Russia in the East has Japan watching for an opportunity, it is a big question whether it can act boldly in the West. Therefore, the military sanctions of the League of Nations and the direct action of France and Russia may all be difficult to achieve. As for economic sanctions, with the precedent of Italy, it is doubtful whether they can be thoroughly implemented.</p>
<h3>Germany Unilaterally Declares Treaty Abolished - French Government's Response - Decides to Submit to the League of Nations - German Memorandum Rejected - Authorizes Naval, Land, and Air Ministers to Take Necessary Measures - Signatory Countries to Convene Emergency Meeting in Paris Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Paris - Today, the French Cabinet held a special meeting and rejected the memorandum from German leader Hitler to the French government declaring the abolition of the Locarno Pact. It considered the memorandum's claims that the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was directed against Germany and conflicted with the Locarno Pact to be unacceptable. After the Minister of War detailed the security plans adopted, the Cabinet authorized the Naval, Land, and Air Ministers to take other necessary measures when the environment requires. The Cabinet also approved the resolution to immediately submit Germany's actions to the Council of the League of Nations for discussion. At the same time, it was decided to hold a meeting of the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact (excluding Germany) in Paris on Sunday. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - Regarding Germany's abolition of the Locarno Pact, the French Cabinet recently held a state council meeting and passed four resolutions: 1. The memorandum sent by the German government cannot be accepted. 2. In accordance with the original provisions of the Locarno Pact, the case will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for handling. 3. It is decided to convene a meeting of the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact (Britain, Belgium, and Italy) in Paris on Tuesday, the 10th of this month, to consult each other. 4. The Ministers of the Navy, Land, and Air are authorized to take necessary steps as appropriate, and the Chief of Land, General Maurin, has already mobilized some troops and taken preventive measures, which are also approved. The French government also decided to submit a report to the Chamber of Deputies next Tuesday afternoon, and Prime Minister Sarraut is scheduled to deliver a broadcast speech this afternoon at 7:30 PM to inform the people of the country. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - France is determined to reject the rearmament of the Rhineland and demands military assistance from the other signatory countries to the Locarno Treaty, which has been confirmed by the Foreign Ministry spokesperson today. France has today demanded that Britain respond quickly to France's recent inquiry about what actions Britain will take if German troops march into the Rhineland. The spokesperson said that Germany has decided to oppose the re-stationing of troops in the Rhineland, and the background of this matter is Germany's preparation to deal with Central and Eastern Europe with imperialistic actions. France does not believe that Hitler's claim of a new start is sincere because he abandons treaties he does not like too easily. According to the provisions of the Locarno Treaty, France can request military assistance from other signatory countries until the German troops withdraw from the demilitarized zone. France will also ask the League of Nations to try economic and financial sanctions, as well as military actions. At that time, Germany signed the Locarno Treaty out of free will so that the Allied forces could withdraw from the Rhineland as soon as possible. Now, France will do its best to make Germany respect the treaty. If necessary, it will submit it to the League of Nations and request the Hague Court to inquire about Germany's reasons for dissatisfaction with the Franco-Soviet treaty. In any case, France will never sacrifice its security and will fight to the end with Britain within the scope of the League of Nations. After the Saar plebiscite, Hitler repeatedly stated that there were no more differences of opinion with France. Therefore, France is at a loss to explain his tearing up of the treaty. Before the Foreign Ministry issued this statement today, the authorities had consulted with senior officials of the Navy, Land, and Air forces for a long time, and the diplomatic representatives of the other signatory countries to the Locarno Treaty were also consulted. It is believed here that this statement is very important because the signatory countries are bound by the treaty and have the obligation to provide military assistance, so military action is possible.

<h3>Flandin Issues Declaration - Germany's Opposition to Franco-Soviet Agreement Unjustified - Unilateral Treaty Abandonment Cannot Be Recognized</h3>
<p>Paris - At the Cabinet meeting last night, Prime Minister Sarraut, Minister of War Maurin, Minister of Navy Pietri, and Minister of Air Denain all attended. Foreign Minister Flandin announced that Germany's actions have shocked the whole of Europe, and France will submit the matter to the League of Nations for adjudication. Flandin said in a speech in the famous clock room of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that after the French Ambassador in Berlin heard the news that Germany was planning to deny the Locarno Pact and send troops to the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, he visited German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath on February 18. At that time, it was decided to keep the matter strictly confidential, and then the French Ambassador was ordered to discuss with Hitler the best way for the two countries to achieve friendship. Flandin also said that Germany's opposition to the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Agreement is unjustified. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - Prime Minister Sarraut convened another cabinet meeting at 6:15 PM to study the issue of Germany's re-fortification of the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland. Foreign Minister Flandin then issued a declaration to the press, saying, "The government now submits the decision taken by Germany for public opinion to judge. This is the government's responsibility, but it is also not enough to bind the measures that the government may take in the future. France has been in constant contact with the countries concerned, planning a common response to Germany's unilateral treaty abandonment and submitting the matter to the Council of the League of Nations for handling." Flandin further explained that recently, German leader Adolf Hitler made a statement to a reporter from a French newspaper, advocating that France and Germany should cooperate with each other. The French government instructed Ambassador Ponsot in Germany to visit Hitler on the 29th of last month to inquire on what basis the cooperation should be carried out. Hitler immediately replied that he would provide an answer later, but asked France to keep the statement confidential. German Foreign Minister Neurath was also present at the time. When Hitler summoned the ambassadors of the signatory countries to the Locarno Pact this morning to announce the abolition of the treaty, Ponsot asked whether the abolition of the treaty was the answer he had previously mentioned. Hitler replied, "Yes, yes." Flandin then criticized Hitler's speech in the Chamber of Deputies, saying that the German government believed that the purpose of the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty was to target Germany, which was completely inaccurate. Moreover, the other signatory countries to the Locarno Pact all supported the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, which Hitler did not mention. "If Germany has any dissatisfaction with the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, it should have conducted negotiations through diplomatic channels, or it should have consulted through reconciliation procedures in accordance with the Locarno Pact. Why didn't Germany do this but rushed to abandon the treaty?" Regarding Germany's suggestion of negotiating a new treaty among the countries concerned, Flandin said, "The Locarno Pact was freely signed by Germany, and its purpose was to make Germany and France abandon their grievances. Now, the German government says that the starting point for Germany and France to reconcile should be this unilateral act of abandoning the treaty, which is absurd. On the contrary, the German government disregards its obligations, sends troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, puts France in a fait accompli, and wants France to recognize it and negotiate at the same time. How can France accept this?" (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris - Before the Cabinet meeting, Flandin visited the French, Italian, Russian, and Polish ambassadors one after another in the afternoon. The French political circles are making every effort to remain calm about the overall situation, and the Chamber of Deputies has not shown any signs of outrage. The political circles believe that Hitler's recent actions are more serious than the denial of the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles. However, this is a natural development of Hitler's policy, and its only consequence will be to consolidate the unity of France and Britain. The people of eastern France were very calm when they heard the news of Hitler's actions. The return of German troops to the Rhineland was broadcast to the public by radio. Several German officers have arrived in Saarbrücken, and German troops will arrive there within days. Those responsible in various circles said that Hitler's proposal to establish a demilitarized zone on the border is unacceptable because if it is accepted, France will destroy the defense works built with huge sums of money to replace the withdrawal of German troops from the illegally occupied demilitarized zone. The German leader's actions have made the French and German armies only a bridge apart between Strasbourg and Kehl, compared to 31 miles away before. This will force France to change its defense and mobilization plans. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to well-informed sources, since the obligation of the demilitarized zone concerns the overall situation in Europe, Germany's unilateral action to abandon it has been decided by France not to be accepted. That is, the various proposals put forward by German leader Hitler, from France's point of view, are no different from recognizing the unilateral abandonment of the treaty and replacing it with a new one. This kind of act of stealing the day and changing the sky cannot be rewarded. In addition, another proposal put forward by Germany advocates that France should also划出 demilitarized zone within its own territory, while Germany deploys defenses along the Rhine River. Responsible persons believe that France will never accept this. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>France Increases Troops - Strengthens Eastern Defenses - Belfort Implements Alert - Military Personnel All Stop Giving Leave</h3>
<p>Paris - General Maurin's aides recently announced that all troops stationed in border fortresses have been ordered to enter the fortresses to strengthen defenses, and other troops have not been mobilized on a large scale. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - Troops will be deployed to the French territory in the Rhine River basin today to strengthen defenses, and the city of Belfort in southern Lorraine has implemented alert measures since last night. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris - According to responsible sources, after Germany refortified the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River, France will immediately take military measures to guard against it. Minister of War Kang Leng will order the troops stationed on the eastern border to return to their original defenses tomorrow, allowing them to defend the newly completed defense works. By the end of this week, all officers and soldiers will be stopped from giving leave, and those who are currently on leave must cancel their leave and return to defense. However, according to a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, the Cabinet does not intend to recall soldiers who have now retired, and new recruits will be enlisted as usual next month. The Cabinet is scheduled to meet at 10:00 AM tomorrow to approve the above measures. As for other military measures, they will be taken after the Council of the League of Nations has made a decision at its meeting. The spokesperson also said that Britain, France, and Italy held a meeting in Stresa in April last year and passed a resolution, which was subsequently approved by the Council of the League of Nations. The resolution condemned all unilateral acts of abolishing treaties and decided to implement economic and financial sanctions against the treaty-breaking country. France is now working to implement sanctions. In addition, according to responsible sources, the significance of the German troops entering the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River is not only symbolic. The demilitarized zone along the Rhine River originally had police forces, and these police officers were all included in the national defense forces. If they are combined with the troops that entered today, their number is as large as the number of French border guards on the left bank of the Rhine, so precautions must be taken. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Paris - This agency's diplomatic reporter believes that after the German troops entered the demilitarized zone of the Rhine River, the strategic position of the eastern border of France has suddenly changed. When the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the establishment of a demilitarized zone was the origin of the various provisions contained in Articles 42 and 43 of the treaty. Later, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium signed the Locarno Pact in 1925, which further guaranteed it. At that time, after free negotiations, Germany signed this pact, and it also promised to respect the demilitarized zone. Until now, France has always thought that the border on the Rhine River will not be threatened, so it has not paid much attention to the defense works and mobilization measures there. Now that the German troops have entered the demilitarized zone, France's defense works and mobilization measures must be changed. As for the impact of this move by Germany on the overall situation in Europe, military experts here believe that the Rhine River has always been known as a natural barrier. Once defenses are deployed, it is as solid as a soup made of gold, as long as a small number of troops are stationed there. If so, Germany can draw large troops and move towards Eastern and Central Europe. Therefore, the re-establishment of defenses on the Rhine River is not only a danger to France alone but also a hidden danger to the whole of Europe. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Get Rid of Treaty Shackles - German Troops Open Rhine District - Calculated Infantry Artillery 25,000 - Flags Flying, People Excited</h3>
<p>Cologne - German troops have returned to the Rhine River area today. Germany has been shackled by the Treaty of Versailles for seventeen years, and today it has finally broken free. This evening, 19 infantry battalions and 23 artillery squadrons entered the Rhineland, totaling 25,000 people. General Kluge is inspecting the incoming soldiers in the city, seeing that they are all proud and determined to die, with a strong military appearance and accompanying field equipment and air defense equipment. The people in the city are also welcoming them with all their hearts, with flags flying and the streets empty. Everywhere the troops pass through the streets, women, children, and the elderly cheer in unison, with only the tips of guns visible. Behind the infantry are armored vehicles. City officials and National Socialist Party authorities are formally addressing and welcoming them. It is reported that the situation in other cities in the Rhineland is roughly the same. (National News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>Berlin - From today onwards, the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland will be stationed with 19 infantry battalions and 13 artillery detachments. Most of the troops will be stationed along the Rhine River and in the Rhine Valley between the Black Forest and the Rhine River. Small detachments will also be stationed in Aachen, Trier, and Saarbrücken. Two air force detachments arrived today at the new defense posts in Cologne, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, and Mannheim. Two high-altitude artillery detachments will be stationed in Cologne and Mannheim. Thousands of soldiers passed by the Prime Minister's Office tonight holding searchlights high, expressing the public's welcome for Hitler's recent actions. The residents of Cologne were caught off guard by the German troops' reoccupation of the demilitarized zone in the Rhineland and were surprised. At 9:00 AM this morning, nine planes flew in formation over the city, which was the first sign of the German troops' occupation of the Rhineland. The news spread as quickly as lightning. When General Kluge arrived by car at the famous church square to inspect the passing of the troops at 2:15 PM in the afternoon, the public gathered there with great excitement, and the mayor welcomed him as usual. The troops were mostly presented with flower bouquets by the public, and a team of drummers led the way, marching in goose steps. Infantry regiments followed, with three people in a row, and the entire team had 800 officers and soldiers. Today, flags are flying all over Mainz, and they are everywhere. The cafes are full, and the public is celebrating the return of the German troops to the Rhine, holding a grand lantern festival. The entry of German troops into the country caught the soldiers off guard. The news spread like wildfire, and the streets were filled with people in an instant. When the troops passed through the old fortress of Kastel on the right bank of the Rhine, the public cheered enthusiastically. It has been eighteen years since the end of the Great War, and Mainz now has defensive forces again, and the public is very happy. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Blomberg's Speech - The Wishes of the New Germany - Do Not Use War as a Policy Tool</h3>
<p>Berlin - Minister of Defense General Blomberg recently gave a speech saying, "The wishes of the new Germany are not to use war as a tool to pursue national policy, but if the causes of war are not eliminated, the scourge of war will not be stopped. One-sided military alliances, sanctions, and intolerable status quo are all hidden threads for future wars. The Germany ruled by Leader Hitler is stronger than any time in the past. If the Treaty of Versailles can be revised in a peaceful manner in a timely manner, we will be grateful." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Meeting Today - Decides Stance on German Issue</h3>
<p>London - The Cabinet is now scheduled to hold an emergency meeting on Monday (the 9th) to study the current situation. The House of Commons was originally scheduled to discuss the government's white paper on national defense policy on that day (the 10th), so Foreign Minister Eden is expected to request the House of Commons to postpone the discussion for two days so that he can rush to Geneva to attend. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>London - Reuters has learned that the British government has not yet reached any agreement on Germany's occupation of the Rhineland demilitarized zone. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>London - After Germany abolished the Locarno Pact, Foreign Office officials here stated that the British government will formally protest against Germany, but if it is based on the suggestions made by German leader Hitler and engages in negotiations, Britain is also in favor. Foreign Minister Eden has already lodged a verbal protest during his meeting with German Ambassador von Hoesch this morning. The second step of the British government is to have the League of Nations take normal procedures to revise the current system in the Rhine River area, so as to avoid Germany's treaty abandonment from becoming a fait accompli. Regarding this point, Leader Hitler stated in his memorandum to the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact that Germany is prepared to return to the League of Nations, which is highly valued by British political circles. Therefore, it is hoped that Germany's lightning-fast posture can be replaced by the normal procedures of the League of Nations. As for the suggestion made by Germany in the memorandum to conclude a new Locarno Pact (limited to 25 years, including the Netherlands, and with Britain and Italy as guarantor countries), people here are also quite in favor, but they believe that it is difficult to reason with France if it wants to promise to划出 demilitarized zones within its own territory. In addition, the proposal to conclude a Western European Sky Pact is expected to have no obstacles in the future and is extremely favored here. As for Germany's proposal to divide the Treaty of Versailles and the Covenant of the League of Nations as conditions for returning to the League of Nations, high-ranking officials here have held this view for some time, so it will not cause resentment. In short, the shape of future negotiations will depend on France's attitude. People here understand that the country is worried about Germany's actions and agree with the country's decision to file a lawsuit with the Council of the League of Nations. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Russia and Czechoslovakia Guarantee France Willing to Provide Strong Support to Jointly Confront Germany</h3>
<p>Following the news of Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact reaching Paris, Foreign Minister Flandin immediately held consultations with the British, Italian, Russian, Polish, and Czechoslovakian ambassadors to France, starting from 4:05 PM and concluding at 6:05 PM. Soviet Ambassador Potemkin and Czechoslovakian Minister Osuský had discussions in the Foreign Ministry's reception room before meeting with Flandin. Subsequently, both provided guarantees to Flandin, stating that the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia would fully support France's request to the League of Nations Council. Flandin is scheduled to hold talks with the ambassadors of the countries that signed the Locarno Pact on Monday, immediately after the British cabinet meeting, to determine collective action to be taken in Geneva to jointly confront Germany.

<h3>Why Does Mussolini Want War?</h3>
<p>— By Louis Fisher, translated by Bingfu</p>
<p>Observations on the Clouded European Situation, Part 4 (Middle)</p>
<p>In Rome, there are many proponents of Italian imperialism, and they are all very articulate. "We are a young nation," they say, "and Fascism has awakened our strength. But Italy is very poor, and its population is unbearably crowded. We cannot allow ourselves to remain in perpetual distress without struggling. Foreign countries, especially the United States, now refuse our immigrants. In the past, emigration not only alleviated population pressure but also brought a large amount of wealth back to the motherland. Moreover, high tariff barriers restrict our exports, and the global panic has deepened these difficulties. We must find outlets for our surplus population, our goods, and our labor!"</p>
<p>But why must the Fascists enshrine foreign expansion as a creed? Is internal development impossible? This question was answered by Mussolini, who occasionally reverts to the theories he studied in his early years of Marxism. In a speech to the Chamber of Deputies on May 26, 1927, he said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, to make Italy a strong nation, she must have a population of sixty million in the second half of the twentieth century. You must ask, 'How can such a large population of sixty million be accommodated within this territory?' But in 1815, when Italy had only sixteen million people, the same criticism was made. At that time, many people probably believed that it was simply impossible to accommodate the current population of forty million within our borders, and at a higher standard of living."</p>
<p>The Blackshirt leader has never spoken more wisely. This anti-Malthusian doctrine has been proven by the experiences of various countries. Just as Italy's population, without the help of colonies, increased from sixteen million to forty million in one hundred and twelve years, the world's population has also increased significantly due to the increase in capitalist production and the improvement of public health (which is also a coefficient of increased production). What obstacles have arisen to this continuous development?</p>
<p>I took this question to Italian Minister of Agriculture Rossoni, who is worth noting as a member of the Grand Fascist Council of Eighteen. After the conversation, I recorded his words and had him sign them. He first spoke of the progress of Italian agriculture, her wheat harvest, and the high yield per hectare. In principle, we agreed that independent cultivation by small farmers yields a greater harvest than working for large landowners and employs more labor. So I said to him: "You are now dictators. Why not nationalize the land?" "Dictatorship," the minister replied, "is a political matter, not an economic or social one. We cannot take land back from large landowners. We also cannot set the price at which we buy land from landowners. The land price set in Italy is no different from that in France, the United States, and other countries. We will follow past procedures to buy uncultivated wasteland. If the landowner is willing to sell the entire property, that is fine; if he only wants to sell part of it and keep the rest for himself, that is also fine. Those farmers who receive the land sold by the landowner will have fifteen to twenty years to pay off the debt. Sometimes they become co-cultivators with the landowner. In this way, we can reclaim two million hectares of wasteland in five years and distribute it to four hundred thousand farming households. The Fascist government is preparing houses, equipment, and livestock for those new residents. They can also repay the debt in twenty years."</p>
<p>This method must be slow and inadequate because it places a heavy burden on the government's finances. Many landowners have become rich by selling all or part of their property at fictional high prices. Moreover, many farmers dare not rashly shoulder such a huge debt at the beginning of that difficult new venture. Perhaps that is why "densely populated" Italy still has much uncultivated wasteland. According to the Roman Catholic daily newspaper of December 7 last year, the leaders of the Fascist Farmers' Associations of various provinces met in Rome to demand land distribution. So I insisted, saying to Rossoni, "Why do you want to conquer Abyssinia to remedy Italy's overpopulation, instead of starting with domestic land improvement?"</p>
<p>"War," he replied, "may have economic reasons, but the main reasons are still moral and political. France acquired colonies not because of its overpopulation, and neither did England. Although economic issues are important, the state cannot exist solely dependent on economic conditions. Italy will make new contributions in culture. A new system will surely improve the current state of Abyssinia. Mussolini has created a new country with a cultural mission."</p>
<p>These words did not satisfy me, so I said again: "You are dictators, you can send people to the battlefield or tell them to die. But why can't you take the barren fields owned by the landowners and give them to the farmers?"</p>
<p>Mr. Rossoni, who aroused my great interest, answered with the same frankness: "That is what is called rogue politics. Farmers must have guidance. 'Giving land to farmers' is just a slogan! It should be organized. However, we are Fascists, not Socialists." But Rossoni, like Mussolini, used to be called a Socialist and a worker. This made me particularly interested in this conversation. Later we talked about cooperatives. He said: "Italian cooperatives are composed of capitalists, technicians, and workers. Technicians are responsible for creating and guiding industries. They must not be allowed to be tools of capitalists; they must lead the workers. Technicians are really the bridge between workers and employers. (These reminded me of the American 'Technocracy' system.) Workers themselves are not capable of executing; if he has talent, he will rise to the level of the capitalist. I know that socialist leaders, when they discover their talents, go to stand with the capitalists. Workers should be well organized, and not let them be free and unrestrained. Strikes are a foolish act. I am not bourgeois. We are anti-bourgeois."</p>
<p>Mussolini is the Director-General of Cooperatives. In reality, the Director-General is represented by Director Radini. Radini also spoke to me casually about the nature of cooperatives. He asserted: "Cooperatives want to find a common ground between factory owners and workers, but in the end, the factory owner is still the factory owner, and the worker is still the worker... The cooperative system is not against capitalism." He said this last sentence several times and tried to prove it in order to make me believe it.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Council to Convene Tomorrow to Discuss Germany's Treaty Abandonment Issue, Invoking Article 17 of the Covenant</h3>
<p>Geneva The League of Nations Council will convene an extraordinary meeting on Tuesday to discuss the situation caused by Germany's announcement of abandoning the Locarno Pact and occupying the Rhineland. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Geneva Regarding the German government's abandonment of the Locarno Pact, the League of Nations Council is expected to address the issue on Thursday, the 12th of this month. Representatives from all signatory countries of the Locarno Pact are expected to attend, and Belgium, as a signatory country, will also send representatives. League of Nations officials believe that the Council may accept the request of the signatory countries of the Pact and demand that the German government withdraw its troops from the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River and request that it fulfill the obligations stipulated in Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant (which states that if there is a dispute between a member state and a non-member state, the non-member state should be requested to accept the obligations of the member state and resolve the dispute based on conditions deemed just by the Council). If Germany refuses this request, the Council will formally declare that Germany has violated the Locarno Pact and automatically implement Article 16 of the Covenant, and the member states will jointly execute appropriate sanctions until Germany complies. Before the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact make a decision in the Council, they will not take any military action other than taking necessary precautionary measures. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Belgium Takes Military Measures to Cope with Tense Situation, Special Committee Established to Consider Defense</h3>
<p>Beijing In response to the tense situation caused by Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland, the Belgian government has established a special committee to deal with this emergency. The committee includes members of parliament and senior military officers, and its responsibility is to design Belgium's border defenses and prepare the necessary war supplies. (National News Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Beijing Prime Minister Janson successively met with the British, French, and Italian ambassadors and the Dutch minister this afternoon to hold discussions on the situation arising from Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact. The cabinet has ordered the troops stationed in the east to suspend all leaves. It is reported that the cabinet will also take other military measures. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Germany Negotiates Non-Aggression Pact, Netherlands Treats It Coolly, Maintains Traditional Policy of Neutrality</h3>
<p>The Hague German Chancellor Hitler suggested that the Netherlands join in concluding a non-aggression pact, but this has been ignored here. An Associated Press reporter learned from well-informed sources that the Netherlands is unlikely to accept this suggestion but will continue to adhere to its traditional policy of complete independence and complete neutrality. (National News Agency Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Moscow's Emphasis: Recognizes Germany's Move as a Threat to European Peace</h3>
<p>Moscow Regarding Chancellor Hitler's abandonment of the Locarno Pact and the dispatch of troops to occupy the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, political circles here believe that this act, even if it confirms an accomplished fact, will have a significant impact. At a time when incidents are occurring in Tokyo, and the world is panicking, and Italy is being constrained by the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and the French Chamber of Deputies is about to be re-elected, Hitler brazenly disregards this and destroys the existing treaty, which is essentially an act of extortion and should not be ignored. In short, how the situation will evolve depends on the attitude of the British government. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Moscow Circles have not yet commented on Hitler's speech announcing the dispatch of troops to occupy the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland and the rejection of the Locarno Pact. However, non-political circles believe that Hitler's move is intended to intimidate France into not ratifying the mutual assistance agreement, but it is expected that the result of Hitler's speech will be to force France to ultimately ratify the agreement. As for his advocacy of peace and the proposal to conclude mutual non-aggression pacts, many feel it is not worth paying serious attention to because Germany's unilateral denial of its obligations has repeatedly occurred and it is not a trustworthy country. Observers are particularly disturbed by the portions of Hitler's speech regarding pan-Germanism, believing that Germany intends to wage war against Russia. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Moscow People in the capital were deeply shocked upon hearing the news, acknowledging that this move is enough to endanger European peace. Responsible parties believe that Hitler's proposal should be for neighboring countries to conclude mutual non-aggression pacts, and since he did not mention Czechoslovakia at all, it can be inferred that he harbors other intentions towards Czechoslovakia, as Czechoslovakia has a mutual assistance treaty with Russia. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>The United States Is Not Affected, Expresses No Desire to Interfere in European Affairs, New York Military Supply Stocks Soar</h3>
<p>Washington Officials stated today that the dispute in Europe caused by Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Treaty has no impact on the United States. It is said that the German-American peace treaty does not contain provisions similar to the third clause of the Treaty of Versailles, so the US government will probably never get involved in the tense situation caused by Germany's reoccupation of the Rhineland. (National News Agency Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Washington The government did not immediately respond to Germany's announcement of the abandonment of the Locarno Pact and the occupation of the Rhineland, so general observers today did not make any affirmative criticisms of the matter. However, observers believe that Hitler's actions are a direct challenge to the status quo, and people here believe that France will not accept Germany's proposal to negotiate a mutual non-aggression pact. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>New York Today, upon learning of Hitler's decision to abandon the Locarno Pact and dispatch troops to the Rhineland, the market for military supply stocks on the commodity exchange was booming, the prices of aircraft company stocks soared, and the French franc fell nearly two pounds. (Reuters Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>British and French Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>The London Observer commented on Germany's refusal to recognize the Locarno Pact and the dispatch of troops to occupy the Rhineland, saying that Hitler has completely erased the achievements of the Anglo-French appeasement of Europe proposal in February 1935. We should approach this with a cool head and a fair mind. Britain's first need is to first repair its national defense deficiencies and consider Hitler's proposals with a spirit of sympathy and goodwill. The new points put forward by Hitler are that the League of Nations Covenant should not be confused with the Treaty of Versailles, and that the Rhineland should honestly acknowledge that it belongs entirely to Germany, without hindrance. Hitler's two points are quite justified. Now, without basic justice and common sense, there can be no peace to speak of. "Advance in force and then aid with virtue" remains the admirable principle of Prussian militarism. Before the war, the Foreign Office's outward handiwork had already turned this into an international stain. But this move makes any international vigilance wither. The entire system advocated by Hitler now truly depends on whether other countries value Germany's trust and commitment to the treaty. Hitler's current actions have dealt a major blow to this trust, but not a fatal blow. This point must be weighed calmly. But in the process of weighing, it is not difficult to imagine that among the most dangerous trends in Europe since 1932, yesterday's incident is the most serious, most alarming, and perhaps an irreversible step. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London German Chancellor Hitler abandoned the Locarno Pact and suggested that the signatory countries negotiate another treaty. The comments made by various newspapers here are extremely inconsistent. The Daily Express, Observer, People's Report, and Daily Chronicle all believe that the future is not without hope. Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden recently published an article in the Sunday Express, stating, "Hitler's speech has changed the European situation. The people of European countries should not allow others to ignore the proposals put forward by Hitler. If they refuse, the only way to deal with it is to immediately convene a European conference to seek a solution." Writer Sir Gibbs published an article in the Sunday Chronicle, stating, "Hitler's decision has given mankind a new hope. The seven principles he put forward also aim at the spirit of peace. If these principles can be accepted, all fears in the world should be swept away. Conversely, if they are rejected outright, it is a crime against all mankind." (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris The newspapers here, regardless of party affiliation, are all indignant at Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact and urge the people to remain calm. However, many demand that the government adopt a firm attitude to deal with Germany. Su Jiang's reports from various newspapers are as follows:</p>
<p>The right-wing Le Journal published an article by renowned reporter Bertina, stating, "A partial or national mobilization order will not be issued by the French government for the time being, but active safety measures should be taken, such as recalling all officers and soldiers on vacation to their original defenses." It also stated that France should request the League of Nations Council to implement economic and financial sanctions, as socialist Germany's economic structure is extremely fragile and difficult to sustain under sanctions. To implement sanctions against Germany, countries should also conclude military agreements to form a security network to express solidarity.</p>
<p>The right-wing Le Petit Parisien stated, "The situation has reached a critical juncture, and the people of all countries should be aware of this. The various proposals put forward by Hitler should not be readily believed to be sincere."</p>
<p>Le Jour stated, "Britain, France, and Italy are now under the influence of divisive tactics, and there are not a few disagreements among them. Hitler's abandonment of the Locarno Pact was a sudden occurrence, and it is fortunate if the groups that originally aimed to maintain European security are reunited as a result."</p>
<p>The left-wing L'Ere Nouvelle stated that it is unknown in what attitude Germany will return to the League of Nations. "The signatory countries of the Locarno Pact should immediately respond to Germany's act of abandonment and should not be complacent."</p>
<p>The left-wing Socialist Le Populaire stated that Germany's act of abandonment should be answered by Geneva. World peace is on the verge of extinction, and only Britain, France, and Russia can preserve it. The far-left Communist L'Humanité stated that the signatory countries of the Locarno Pact should resolutely reject Hitler's proposals. (Havas Dispatch, Paris, 8th)</p>
<h3>Attitudes of European Countries</h3>
<p>Paris Regarding the German government's abandonment of the Locarno Pact and the dispatch of troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, people from various European countries have made various comments. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Belgium The entire Belgian nation is shocked, but able to maintain composure.</p>
<p>Poland Responsible Polish officials declared that Germany's move is a reaction to the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact. Judging from the most recent statements made by German authorities, this was already within expectations. As for Poland, when it signed the Locarno Pact in 1925, it already considered it unfavorable.</p>
<p>Warsaw Regarding the German government's abandonment of the Locarno Pact, Polish political circles believe that Poland and Germany have concluded a mutual non-aggression treaty to regulate mutual relations. Germany's decision to abandon the treaty is not directly related to Poland, but the European situation may be seriously affected, and the Polish government must be vigilant. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Yugoslavia Political circles here refused to comment on the German government's abandonment of the Locarno Pact. The Yugoslavian government will decide on its attitude after the signatory countries of the pact have expressed their views. (Geneva News Agency Dispatch, 8th) Officials of Czechoslovakia made no criticisms. Well-informed people said that the conclusion of the mutual assistance pact between France and the Soviet Union should not be used by Germany as an excuse to unilaterally abandon the Locarno Pact. Due to the German Chancellor Hitler's recent announcement, Austrian officials have not explicitly commented on Austria. Hungarian officials did not express any dissent regarding the speech delivered by German Chancellor Hitler. They instead claimed that Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Pact was beneficial to Hungary, and that Hungary's demand to revise the Trianon Peace Treaty could thus be advanced.

<h3>Ethiopian Minister of War Passes Away, Participated in the Battle of Adwa Forty Years Ago, Re-established the Ethiopian Army and Was Respected by the People</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa Ethiopian Minister of War General Mulugeta Yeggazu passed away today. According to official sources, he died of pneumonia at the age of seventy. Mulugeta was one of Ethiopia's most famous generals, and he participated in the Battle of Adwa in 1896, re-establishing the Ethiopian army, and was therefore respected by the people. Mulugeta was an aristocrat with considerable wealth and was said to hold xenophobic views. It is said that at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian War, he advised the Ethiopian Emperor to cleanse the country of foreigners. In January of the opening of the war, Mulugeta led an army of 100,000 to the front, and was known for his military skill. He had two sons, one of whom was a military officer.

<h3>Italian Aircraft Reconnaissance in the Sky, Panic in Addis Ababa, Residents Flee, City Presents a Scene of Death</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa Since Italian military aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights in the Addis Ababa sky yesterday, the people of the capital believed this to be a prelude to bombing, and were greatly terrified and fled in droves. Yesterday, 2,200 government-employed messengers went to the streets and alleys of the capital to read out a palace order, stating that all residents of the city should evacuate the city by 6:00 AM this morning to prevent Italian military aircraft from dropping bombs. The orders were such that cars, trucks, horses, donkeys, etc. were constantly traveling back and forth on the streets, carrying residents out of the city to hide, and the sound of trampling never ceased. By the time the east was white this morning, half of the residents in the city had fled to the countryside, including many foreigners. Shops were closed and markets were closed, and they had not reopened until after noon. No one was in the palace. The stored aircraft gasoline was also moved out, so the whole city was silent and lifeless. Those wandering the streets were only firefighters, soldiers wearing long swords, newspaper reporters, and paparazzi. These people held binoculars and looked up at the sky, hoping to see Italian military aircraft soaring, but the sky was filled with clouds and fog, and there was nothing to see. At the same time, rumors were rife that there were six aircraft circling in the sky above the railway station, dropping many leaflets. As for the hooligans, they took the opportunity to make a fortune. These people have traces in some shops, but the villains were arrested and sentenced to whipping, and one of them will be hanged as a warning. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Military's Firm Stance: New Japanese Cabinet Fails to Materialize; Hirota and Terauchi Continue Negotiations; Success of Cabinet Formation Still Uncertain</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Japan – Despite holding a meeting today in Tokyo, a new cabinet has yet to be formed. Prime Minister Hirota conferred at length this morning with individuals he wanted to bring into the cabinet but faced obstacles. This afternoon, he met with Terauchi, who refused to accept the position of Army Minister, and Nagano, the prospective Navy Minister. In the evening, he, along with leaders from the army and political circles, went to Hirota's residence for a four-hour confidential discussion, exchanging opinions and agreeing to convene again. A decision on the cabinet lineup may be reached at that time. The leaders of the Navy and Army held their own meetings today to discuss their respective stances. (Eighth, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The crucial meeting between Foreign Minister Hirota and the two generals, Terauchi and Nagano, lasted from 3:40 PM to 7:50 PM on the eighth, exceeding four hours. Despite their efforts to understand the current situation, their opinions did not fully align, and no progress was made in forming the cabinet. Therefore, the discussion was postponed until tomorrow. Generals Terauchi and Nagano are scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Hirota again at 9:00 AM on the ninth. (Eighth, Dōmei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Since the renewed meeting between Hirota and Terauchi yesterday, the situation seemed to have improved for the cabinet formation. However, due to the military's increasingly firm stance, a general consensus on the Hirota cabinet has become stronger, compelling General Terauchi to follow suit. Consequently, today's third meeting unexpectedly took a turn for the worse, potentially leading to a very unfavorable outcome. (Eighth, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The meeting between Foreign Minister Hirota and Generals Terauchi and Nagano, which began at 3:40 PM this afternoon, concluded at 7:55 PM. General Terauchi appeared tense when he left, telling reporters, "I have not yet accepted the position of Army Minister, and this situation may continue tomorrow. As for whether there will be a rupture or a successful cabinet formation, the future remains difficult to foresee." (Eighth, Dentsu telegram)</p>
<h3>Frequent Interactions Among Army Officers; Terauchi and Nagano Visit Hirota Together</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Despite the critical period today, there has been much activity among army officials from morning to night, displaying a very tense situation. This morning, Imakawa, the director of the Army Affairs Bureau, visited General Terauchi at the Kaiikansha to report on the general situation. Afterward, he visited the residence of Director-General Kosho at the Army Ministry to discuss the developments of yesterday and today for an hour and a half. The director of the Military Investigation Department, Yamashita, and the commander of the Tokyo Military Police, Sakamoto, also went to the Kaiikansha to report on the situation. Then, Chief of Military Affairs Sugiyama, Director-General Kosho, and Director of the Army Affairs Bureau Imakawa gathered to discuss the matter repeatedly, focusing on General Terauchi. On the other hand, Suzuki Soroku, president of the Veterans Association, General Abe, Personnel Bureau Director-General Awamiya and former aides held discussions with General Terauchi and other officers. It is reported that the army's stance remains firm. (Eighth, Dōmei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – At 1:20 PM on the eighth, after discussing with Navy General Nagano at the Naval Ministry, General Terauchi returned to the Kaiikansha and conferred with army officers on various matters. He then visited General Nagano at his official residence again at 3:20 PM to discuss the military's policy towards the Hirota Cabinet. Therefore, somewhat later than planned, the two generals, Nagano and Terauchi, together visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 3:40 PM to listen to his true intentions regarding the understanding of the current situation and the cabinet's policy. Only then can the issue of joining the cabinet or not be decided. (Eighth, Dōmei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Generals Terauchi and Nagano visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Cabinet Headquarters from 3:40 PM on the afternoon of the eighth. At that time, Foreign Minister Hirota presented a plan and requested their understanding. General Terauchi, in order to explain the army's opinions in detail, invited Director of the Army Affairs Bureau Imakawa, Military Affairs Section Chief Lieutenant Colonel Muto, and Major Takashima to participate. On the naval side, Director-General Hasegawa participated. Their important discussions are currently underway. (Eighth, Dōmei News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>Changes in Cabinet Member Selection; Military Still Expresses Dissatisfaction; Future of Cabinet Formation Not Optimistic</h3>
<p>Tokyo – This morning, General Terauchi summoned Director-General Okabe of the Army Ministry, Director of the Army Affairs Bureau Imakawa, and other leaders at the Kaiikansha. After discussing the general situation centered on the Cabinet Formation Headquarters and the changes made to the candidates, they reached the following consensus:</p>
<p>The changed cabinet member selections lack novelty and are not proactive, appearing to be a perfunctory cover-up. It is difficult to expect such candidates to handle this extraordinary time properly.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters, beyond the issue of personnel selection, believe that Foreign Minister Hirota's evasive attitude is a disguise, an attempt to continue suppressing the army, and a manifestation of liberalism that seeks to renew the nation's politics during this extraordinary time. Therefore, they are quite dissatisfied. If Foreign Minister Hirota's attitude and personnel selection are not fundamentally changed, the problem may not be resolved. (Eighth, Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo – At the meeting between Foreign Minister Hirota and General Terauchi, the army's demands regarding the cabinet formation policy have been largely and clearly expressed. Therefore, it is planned to change the cabinet formation policy based on the army's demands. The decision was made after a lengthy discussion centered on Foreign Minister Hirota with Yoshida, Nagata, Baba, Kawasaki, and Obara gathered at the Cabinet Headquarters. The broad outlines determined are as follows:</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister's position will be temporarily held concurrently by the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>The Minister of Home Affairs must be filled by someone outside of political parties.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Obara has decided not to remain in office. Mr. Shimomura's entry into the cabinet has been dropped as he voluntarily declined. No further discussion is anticipated.</p>
<p>In addition, it has been decided to weigh fresh faces and revise the initially agreed-upon cabinet members, concentrating the final efforts to promote the work of the new cabinet. If the army gives its consent, new candidates from political parties can be invited today to the Cabinet Headquarters, where Foreign Minister Hirota will begin discussions with them about joining the cabinet. If the process proceeds smoothly, the enthronement ceremony is expected to be held in the evening of the eighth. However, the army's dissatisfaction with Foreign Minister Hirota's cabinet formation policy does not seem easily alleviated. The renewed meeting between Hirota and Terauchi today is generally considered unlikely to yield a pleasant resolution. Therefore, although there is a glimmer of hope in the cabinet formation, there are still unsettling shadows looming over it. (Eighth, Dōmei News Agency dispatch)</p>

After the meeting, President Matsuoka told people the following: "General Minami, with whom I have a close relationship, is about to leave Manchuria, which I deeply regret. I personally wished to advance and retreat with General Minami, but as a public servant responsible for the South Manchuria Railway, it is inappropriate for me to resign lightly. Moreover, General Minami has also encouraged me, and I also have a close relationship with General Ueda, so I will continue to serve the country in Manchuria," and so on. (Eighth, Dōmei telegram)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province's Various Industrial Control Measures; Rubber and Match Industries' Control Has Been Effective; Sericulture Industry Control Plan Recently Drafted</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province's various emerging industries have recently faced setbacks due to the domestic economic downturn and the weak purchasing power of the people, resulting in sluggish sales. Secondly, competition among businesses and price cutting have led to losses for all in the same industry, causing business to decline daily. Therefore, various industrial groups have voluntarily requested the Construction Department to implement control measures to save their dwindling livelihoods. Industries that have already implemented controls include the rubber products industry and the match manufacturing industry. These two industries will no longer face excessive competition, and their businesses will be slightly protected. Recently, in light of the sericulture industry revival movement in the province, and the successive establishment of new-style silk reeling factories, in order to prevent overproduction and sales, as well as crude and substandard production, the Sericulture Improvement Bureau has specially drafted a sericulture control plan for the province and submitted it to the provincial government for inclusion in the second phase of the three-year administrative plan, so that it can be implemented on schedule, thereby establishing a solid foundation for the revival of the sericulture industry in the province. The control plan is roughly as follows: Year 1 (1936): Target silk merchants for control, first conduct foreign raw silk trade control. Step 1: 1. Dispatch specialists to foreign silk weaving industry areas for inspection, 2. Establish foreign silk market intelligence agencies, 3. Subsidize high-quality raw silk exports, 4. Establish foreign promotion agencies. Step 2: 1. Encourage direct foreign raw silk trade, 2. Establish raw silk public warehouses, 3. Implement raw silk quality inspection, 4. Offer low-interest silk pledge loans, eliminate inferior silk exports. Step 3: 1. Establish raw silk trading agencies in suitable silk sales locations, 2. Specifically promote Guangdong silk to foreign silk weaving factories, 3. Public operation of raw silk foreign trade. Year 2 (1937): Target silk factories for control, implement silk reeling statistics. Step 1: 1. Silk factory registration, 2. Training of silk reeling core personnel, 3. Improvement of cocoon purchase methods, 4. Hold silk quality assessment meetings, 5. Rewards for high-quality raw silk. Step 2: 1. Promulgate standards and restrictions for the establishment of new silk factories, 2. Subsidies for high-quality silk factories, 3. Promulgate grading standards for exported raw silk, 4. Export raw silk quality inspection, 5. Inspection of silk factory equipment, 6. Examination of silk reeling technicians, 7. Hold joint silk factory events. Step 3: 1. Crackdown on inferior silk factories, 2. Adjustment of raw silk production prices, 3. Standardization of raw silk quality, 4. Unified management of silk factories throughout the province. Year 3 (1938): Target silkworm farmers and breeders for silkworm seed control. Step 1: 1. Hold silkworm cocoon assessment meetings, 2. Conduct silkworm seed quality registration, 3. Reward excellent breeders, 4. Determine provincial standard silkworm seed, 5. Train silkworm disease inspection personnel, 6. Train core silkworm breeding technicians. Step 2: 1. Organize and improve breeder contract groups, 2. Implement silkworm seed inspection, 3. Assist excellent breeding grounds, 4. Examination of breeding personnel, 5. Inspection of breeding ground equipment, 6. Hold breeder registration, 7. Promulgate provincial breeding laws. Step 3: 1. Crackdown on inferior silkworm seed, 2. Original silkworm seed will be issued uniformly by the government, 3. Standardization of silkworm seed hatching periods, 4. Standardization of silkworm seed values, 5. Unified management of professional breeding throughout the province. (February 29th)</p>
<h3>Qingdao Coastal Fishing Conditions</h3>
<p>--Fishermen Can Be Divided into Nine Categories--</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Farmers along the coast of Qingdao have traditionally been engaged in fishing. In recent years, with the strong advocacy and protection of the municipal government, the fishing industry has become increasingly developed. The fishing area along the coast is based on Yin Island, while the outer sea is centered on Shazikou and Jianggezhuang, extending east past Baxiandun to Qianli Island, and south to Talian Island, Shuilingshan Island, and Shidao in Laoshan Bay. Fishing seasons are divided into spring and autumn. The coastal spring fishing season runs from mid-March to mid-May according to the lunar calendar, and the autumn fishing season runs from mid-June to early September according to the lunar calendar. The offshore fishing season is longer, with the spring fishing season running from mid-January to mid-May according to the lunar calendar, with April being the best month. The autumn fishing season runs from early September to early December according to the lunar calendar, with September being the best month. However, whether coastal or offshore, the spring fishing season is the most important. During the fishing season, the Qingdao municipal government routinely orders the Public Security Bureau to protect fishermen, and the Third Fleet of the Navy also dispatches warships to protect them, so fishermen can work in peace without worries. Not only that, the municipal government allocates special funds to assist fishermen with capital shortages and avoid the oppression of high-interest loans, so the environment for Qingdao fishermen is superior. Fishermen can be divided into nine categories: 1. Round net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker, swallow fish, hairtail, and prawns, the fishing grounds are Daxiao Gong Island and Zhucha Island and Lingshan Island. 2. Hook net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker, swallow fish, hairtail, and white croaker, the fishing grounds are the ocean and Lingshan Island in this sea. 3. Drift net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker, swallow fish, hairtail, and white scale fish, the fishing grounds are Talian Island, Rongshan, Qingdao Port, and Dagong Island. 4. Silk net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker, hairtail, and yellow croaker, the fishing grounds are the ocean and Lingshan Island in the East Sea. 5. Seine net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker, swallow fish, hairtail, and yellow croaker, the fishing grounds are the ocean and Zhucha Island in this sea. 6. Stationary net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker, swallow fish, hairtail, and prawns, the fishing grounds are the ocean and Donghai in this sea. 7. Lift net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow croaker and yellow croaker. 8. Eye fish and others, the fishing ground is Qingdao. 9. Suspended net fishing, the main fish caught are yellow fish and sea eels, the fishing grounds are Qingdao Port and shallow coastal areas. 10. Gill net fishing, the main fish caught is white scale fish, the fishing grounds are Shazikou. Damai Island, In all nine areas, one to six enter the sea for fishing during the spring fishing season, seven to nine can generally enter the sea for fishing in both spring and autumn, fish merchants and fish brokers purchase the fish caught by fishermen and resell them in large quantities for export or supply them for local sales. Next month will be the peak of the fishing season, which is the golden age for fishermen.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Petty Thief Beaten to Death, Assailant Sentenced to Prison</h3>

<h3>Wu County Anti-Opium Society Secretary Accused</h3>
<p>Huang Heng, who resides at No. 2, Neitaohua Wu, Xiamen, and who served as the secretary of the Wu County Anti-Opium Society and the head of the fourth section of the Wu County government, was recently accused to the Jiangsu Supervisory Envoy's Office. Supervisory Envoy Ding dispatched investigator Zhu Chunli to Wu County to investigate. The Wu County government then dispatched personnel to Suzhou to invite Huang Heng to Wu County and temporarily detained him at the Wu County Hotel. After interrogation by County Magistrate Xu and investigator Zhu, and after strict questioning of soil merchants such as Cai Zhenqian, who bribed him, it was confirmed that Huang Heng was suspected of accepting bribes and committing corruption. Therefore, he has been handed over to the security team for custody and awaiting investigation. Investigator Zhu returned to the province yesterday (eighth) to report and seek instructions.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Hubei and Guangdong (4)</h3>
<p>— Zhao Junhao</p>
<p>(Special Correspondent for This Newspaper)</p>
<p>Talking with Director Ling at Mount Heng</p>
<p>At nine o'clock on the fifth morning, I and my companions again took the hand-cranked car from the seventh section and arrived at the Lu River Bridge. After crossing the river, we walked for about a mile to reach the parking place. The car was made by the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Railway Bureau, converted from a steel flatcar. The seats were arranged horizontally, simple and practical. After the car started, it was exceptionally stable, no different from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Along the way, it was hitched to stone cars, which took a long time, so the driving was a bit slow. Leaning against the window, the misty waters of the Xiang River stretched as far as the eye could see. Occasionally, dense forests and tall bamboos flashed by. The beauty of the scenery was like being on the Qiantang River. After about an hour, we arrived at Hengshan Station, which had no platform, so we got off the train using a ladder. After getting off the train, we immediately took a bamboo sedan to Mount Heng. Along the way, the streams and mountains were just like the road to Yunqi Temple. After twenty minutes, we reached the Xiang River, crossed the river in a boat with the bamboo sedan, and continued to move forward. After another half an hour, we arrived at the Hunan Provincial Highway Hengshan Station. From here, we took a car along the highway. The Hunan Provincial Highway, which extends in all directions, has long enjoyed a high reputation. Even this short journey felt stable and comfortable. At about three o'clock, we arrived at the China Travel Service Mount Heng Guest House, planning to rest here tonight. At about four o'clock, Ling Hongxun, Director of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan Section Engineering Bureau, was on his way to Changsha on official business and took a short break at the Guest House, so I had the opportunity to meet and talk with him. Since matters related to engineering are not easily understood by the public, I raised some common questions to inquire about them. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway is currently divided into three sections: Hubei-Hunan, Zhuzhou-Shaoguan, and Guangzhou-Shaoguan, as is well known. What is the total length in kilometers of the three sections combined?</p>
<p>From Huangsha Station in Guangzhou to Xujiapeng Station in Wuchang, the total length is 1,096 kilometers.</p>
<p>In the future, when the entire line is fully open to traffic, how many hours will it take from Guangzhou to Wuchang?</p>
<p>The Yuehan Railway is more than one hundred kilometers shorter than the Pinghan Railway. When the entire line is open to traffic, it should take more than thirty hours. However, special express trains will not be available until after one year.</p>
<p>What are the facilities for passenger cars on the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section?</p>
<p>We have already ordered five sets of new passenger cars from England, which are expected to arrive in November this year. Each set of passenger cars has first, second, and third class sleeping cars and dining cars. All the equipment inside the cars is the latest style, roughly similar to the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's Blue Steel cars. As for ordinary passenger cars, the Hunan-Hubei and Guangzhou-Shaoguan sections will each use their original vehicles to operate local trains.</p>
<p>How many locomotives have been ordered?</p>
<p>We have ordered twenty-four large locomotives from England, all of which are the latest 4-8-4 type, with a towing capacity of 1,000 tons per car. The speed on flat ground is 60 kilometers per hour. Ten of them have already been delivered.</p>
<p>What are the plans for joint transportation with the Pinghan Railway?</p>
<p>We plan to imitate the joint transportation method of the Tianjin-Pukou and Beijing-Shanghai Railways and plan a Yangtze River ferry between Hankou and Wuchang.</p>
<p>What is the most difficult construction project on the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section?</p>
<p>Between Chenzhou and Lechang, a length of 120 kilometers, the area is a watershed between the Yangtze River and the Pearl River. The terrain is extremely rugged, with a complex mix of hills and valleys, and meandering streams. In the middle, there are large and small mountain ranges of varying heights, winding and crisscrossing in no particular direction. Therefore, surveying this section of the road was extremely difficult. According to British surveyors, at least 66 tunnels would have to be built. However, after careful study by our bureau, the number was reduced to 14 tunnels. If we had followed the British plan, the project might not be completed even now.</p>
<p>Was there banditry during the construction period?</p>
<p>From August to November of the 23rd year [1934], the Zhu-Mao bandit gang, numbering seventy to eighty thousand, fled from Jiangxi into Hunan. Three of our offices were destroyed. Two engineers and one supervisor were kidnapped. Later, the engineers escaped, and the supervisor was also fortunately released. However, the construction of our road was suspended for as long as two months as a result. But the most difficult thing was that Hunan Province concentrated food and silver dollars. Our road had tens of thousands of workers, with no money and no food, how could they survive? Therefore, the coordination was extremely difficult. Fortunately, most of the workers were from the north and did not disperse.</p>
<p>Are the workers all from the north?</p>
<p>No, most of the earthwork workers were recruited locally, and they were all Hunanese. The bridge builders were from Shanghai, and the rest, such as laying tracks and building bridge piers, were mostly northerners.</p>
<p>What was the maximum number of workers? How many are there now?</p>
<p>During the most intense period of work in the 24th year [1935], there were 180,000 workers. Now there are about 60,000 workers.</p>
<p>After this road is completed, what impact will it have on transportation in China?</p>
<p>The most important thing is that there has never been a land route from Guangdong to the interior, only waterways, taking the route through Hong Kong, all of which is monopolized by the British. Even merchants trade with Hong Kong dollars as the standard. In the future, when the Yuehan Railway is open to traffic, large Guangdong merchants can connect with the interior, and the products of the interior, such as Sichuan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces, as well as local products from all over the Yangtze River, can be exported through this road. Taking Hunan Province's local products as an example, the relationship is certainly important. Hunan produces tung oil, which was worth 20 million last year, accounting for the largest share of exports. In the future, it will be so convenient to transport it out via the Yuehan Railway.</p>
<p>In the past, travelers from Central and Northern China and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River had to go to Shanghai and travel by sea to reach Guangdong. In the future, they should take this road. However, for travelers from the Shanghai area, if they do not take a sea route to Guangdong, but travel upstream along the Yangtze River and then south on the Yuehan Railway, I wonder how the cost and time compare to taking a sea route?</p>
<p>The train fare is definitely not expensive. As for the time, the entire line of this road takes only more than thirty hours, so it does not seem to have much impact. However, how to shorten the time for ships from Shanghai to Hankou is another question.</p>
<p>After the entire road is open to traffic, what will be the ticket price?</p>
<p>The third-class fare will be set at about fourteen yuan.</p>
<p>What is the total cost of the entire Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section?</p>
<p>The current funds are estimated at more than 38 million national currency, and the material costs are 1.64 million pounds.</p>
<p>After the start of construction, were there any plans to hire foreign personnel?</p>
<p>There are no foreigners in the engineering, and there are no foreigners in the contracting.</p>
<p>In the future, will the entire road focus on freight or passenger transport? Can the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section expect to break even?</p>
<p>Freight transport will naturally be the main focus. On the revenue and expenditure side of the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section, it is expected that the debts can be cleared after 30 years. The construction funds for this road were borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees. There is a contract that stipulates that only 65% of future operating income can be used, and the rest must be used to repay debts.</p>
<p>When exactly can the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section be connected? Is the current project near completion?</p>
<p>As of the end of February, 98% of the earthwork has been completed. All tunnels have been completed. The retaining walls and small bridges and culverts have been completed. 92% of the large bridges have been completed. In the track laying project, 341 kilometers have been laid out of the entire 405 kilometers, leaving only 64 kilometers. The connection of the tracks on May 15 this year should not be in error.</p>
<p>When is the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section scheduled to be completed? How much time has been shortened now?</p>
<p>In July of the 22nd year [1933], after the Ministry of Railways signed the loan contract with the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board of Trustees, construction began on a large scale. At that time, it was scheduled to be completed in four years, which should have been in June of next year [1937] for the track connection. Now, calculating from the start of construction to the track connection in May [1936], it takes a total of 35 months, which is one year and one month ahead of the original four years. In other words, the four-year plan has been completed in three years.</p>
<p>I talked with Director Ling for half an hour, and I deeply regret that the outside world does not know the details of this huge project. Ling said that he is pragmatic and realistic, and during the construction period, he is busy from morning to night, only seeking to complete it as soon as possible. Everything else is not considered. Therefore, the actual situation is not easy to understand without on-site inspections. After Director Ling finished talking, he continued on his way. I stayed at the Mount Heng Guest House that evening, toured the mountain the next morning, and went to Hengyang in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The reporter also added that the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan section has been operating local trains since January 1 this year, divided into three sections: Zhuzhou to Hengshan, Hengzhou to Qifengdu, and Pingshi to Lechang. However, this car is an engineering car with only one third-class passenger car attached, and tickets are sold on the car.</p>
<p>As for the entire Yuehan Railway, from Wuchang to Changsha, take the Hunan-Hubei train. In the middle section, from Changsha to Pingshi, take a public bus. From Pingshi to Lechang, take the Zhuzhou-Shaoguan train. From Lechang to Guangzhou, take the Guangzhou-Shaoguan train. You can also go directly from Hankou to Guangzhou, but it will take three days and nights on the way.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Dongda Pond Builds a Swimming Pool</h3>
<p>Dongda Pond is one of the famous scenic spots in Wuxi, located in the fourth district, surrounded by mountains and natural scenery. Its back end is high. In the past, it was developed by Mr. Lu Peizhi, who also ran a primary school there. The pond is surrounded by peach and willow trees, which is as beautiful as Shangri-La. The owner, Xu Yanmou, in order to expand construction, and seeing that the local educational authorities still lacked a swimming pool, specially used it to build a swimming pool. Construction started in the early autumn of last year and has lasted for half a year. The entire project is about to be completed. The pool is five zhang long and two zhang wide, with a novel style. It is said that it will be opened for swimming this summer.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prohibit Welcoming Gods and Holding Temple Fairs</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau held its 64th police affairs meeting yesterday, chaired by Chen Yuchu. It was decided: High-and-low ball stalls in urban and rural areas are actually a type of gambling and should be strictly prohibited and punished according to the Regulations on Penalties for Violating Police Regulations; The telephone company should be requested to not delay calls to public security agencies; Welcoming gods and holding temple fairs are superstitious and violate the purpose of the New Life Movement, and have been repeatedly prohibited by provincial orders. Every year from March to April of the lunar calendar, there are temple fairs in urban and rural areas in this county. Incidents arising from temple fairs are not uncommon. The period for temple fairs will arrive in a blink of an eye this year, and it is necessary to strictly prohibit them. It was decided that the bureau should submit a request to the county government for approval.</p>
<h3>Meningitis Found at Jiangsu Wuxi Normal School</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Normal School has been in session for five weeks this semester. Unexpectedly, three first-year junior high school students suddenly suffered from meningitis in succession last week. One student died in the hospital due to ineffective treatment. After the school discovered the disease, it paid special attention to it and immediately hired several doctors to conduct diagnoses of all students and disinfect all dormitories. However, because the school is a place for group living, and there are no less than 600 staff and students in the school, this kind of epidemic infectious disease is very dangerous. In order to ensure the safety of everyone, they specially consulted with the Puren Hospital for guidance on prevention measures and held an emergency school affairs meeting to solicit the opinions of all faculty and staff. The meeting believed that it was necessary to temporarily suspend classes and order all students to return home for isolation. Therefore, the school reported to the Jiangsu Department of Education for approval, and the department has already approved it. Starting from the 7th of this month, it should announce a suspension of classes and order all students to return home so that the school can carry out thorough disinfection. The date for resumption of classes will be notified to the school later.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement by Warehouse Committee Members Discovered</h3>
<p>The County Food Management Committee, in order to have the granaries in various townships established, especially notified the first district of Wenyu, Wanghong, Xingqian, and Jiaqi townships from January 6 this year to collect and distribute storage. Unexpectedly, the stored grain collected by each township was found to contain fine yellow sand, with more than 20 jin in every 100 jin, averaging more than two-tenths. At the same time, it was discovered that there were no grains in the Eastern Township storage. It is estimated that the embezzlement of grain funds amounted to more than 42,000 yuan. County Magistrate Yang immediately convened the committee members to discuss remedies, but because the amount was quite large, it was difficult to resolve it immediately.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Surveying Team for New Canal Will Depart</h3>
<p>The surveying team for the coastal reclamation area in northern Jiangsu, after completing the preliminary reconnaissance last winter, originally planned to depart this spring to conduct an on-site survey of the new river line. However, due to frequent rain and snow since the beginning of spring, and the ground freezing, it was inconvenient to work. Now that spring is warm and the ice has melted, the head of the team, Xu Nanzhou, has specially ordered his subordinates to divide into two teams, engineering and land, with fifteen or sixteen members in each team, divided into seven classes each, to implement the work. The surveying targets of the engineering team are guide lines, benchmarks, cross-sections, water patterns, soil quality, and other items to be used as a plan for future construction. The land team specializes in clearing land, and its clearing scope is temporarily limited to three kilometers near the river. It will be expanded later. The engineering team is currently scheduled to depart for on-site surveying on the 10th of this month, and the land team will depart a week later. The surveying location starts from Dongchuan Dongzha in Dongtai and extends north to the Daohuai estuary, with a river line length of 170 kilometers. It will take about four months to complete the survey. After the first part of the survey is completed, the second part of the northern end will be extended to the southern end of Chenjiagang, passing through Rugao and Nantong, and reaching the north bank of the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Luhe: Workers Disturb Market, Leading to a Strike</h3>
<p>Several hundred road construction workers in Guabu Town, the third district of the county, have been causing trouble for local residents and merchants, snatching food and creating disturbances. As a result, all the shops in the town went on strike the other day (the 5th) and stopped doing business. After the county government received the news, it immediately dispatched a large number of fully armed security team members to the town overnight to suppress the situation and persuade the merchants to reopen their shops. By the morning of the 6th, business had returned to normal. Fortunately, the storm subsided.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Commissioner Ge Visits Subordinate Districts to Inspect</h3>
<p>Nantong District Commissioner Ge Tan, after taking office, instructed the Nantong County chiefs, hoping that they would first assist in eliminating the three evils: addiction, banditry, and bad people. Commissioner Ge will visit the six counties under the district within days to determine the district policy.</p>
<h3>Two Husbands Sue Over Child Custody</h3>
<p>Zhai Jifu, a Yangzhou native residing in Tongcheng, divorced his wife Chen because she repeatedly gave birth to daughters. Chen remarried to Huang Lansheng, a grain merchant in Tangzha. At the end of last year, she gave birth to a baby boy. Recently, Zhai Jifu learned of this and claimed that the baby boy should be returned to him. Huang and Chen refused. Zhai and Huang argued, and the Gang police took Chen and the baby boy to the Public Security Bureau and transferred them to the court. Because the case was a civil matter, the prosecutor instructed them to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Zhejiang Education Community Celebrates March 8th Women's Day</h3>

<h3>Bengbu: Anhui Province Will Immediately Release Emergency Relief Funds</h3>
<p>In recent years, various counties in northern Anhui have suffered from successive years of famine, and the people are struggling to survive. Last year's severe drought has made the disaster even worse. In the depths of winter, starving people are crying out, and relief is urgently needed. The Provincial Relief Committee, seeing this, has recently allocated emergency relief to various counties to alleviate the spring famine. It is learned that in addition to the counties in northern Anhui that have already released funds, Shou County and Huoqiu, which are the most severely affected by the drought, have each been allocated an additional 3,000 yuan, totaling 6,000 yuan. Fuyang, Linquan, Gantai, Tianchang, Quanjiao, and Hefei counties each received 3,000 yuan, totaling 18,000 yuan. Hao County, Jiashan, Chuxian, and Lai'an counties each received 2,000 yuan, totaling 8,000 yuan. 1,500 yuan was also allocated to help children in disaster areas (12 counties). After the spring relief numbers were allocated, staff were sent to various counties to expedite the distribution of the funds in order to save the people in the disaster area. In addition, the provincial government re-allocated 100,000 yuan of the national flood relief public debt, which was continuously allocated by the central government, to exchange for cash, allocated 90,000 yuan for work relief to subsidize the dredging of rivers in northern Anhui, and 10,000 yuan for agricultural relief to lend to the people to purchase seeds to maintain agriculture.</p>

He Xiangning, Zhu Canzhi, Wang Xiaoying, Liu Wang Liming, Mrs. Lei Sai, and representatives from women's organizations and schools throughout the city, about a thousand people, attended. Chen Lingyi, Wang Ruizhu, Qiang Manjun, Bu Zhenhua, Xie Zuyi, Shi Liang, Zhang Zhixue, and seven others served as the presidium.</p>
<p>The Presidium Reports on the Significance of the Commemoration</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chen Lingyi of the presidium first reported on the significance of the commemoration, saying in brief: Today is International Women's Day. We are holding a commemorative meeting here. Now I will briefly explain the origin and significance of Women's Day. Before 1910, women in various countries around the world were regarded as slaves by men and suffered all kinds of oppression. Their lives were simply inhumane. It was not until March 1909 that women in the United States, dissatisfied with the unequal treatment of men, united women's organizations in various cities to hold a Women's Day, which was the precursor to Women's Day. In 1910, at the Socialist Women's Congress in Copenhagen, Denmark, Ms. Clara Zetkin proposed to set an International Women's Movement Day, and everyone decided that March 8th of each year would be Women's Day. At that time, the goal of the women's movement was to seek improvement in the status of men and women, but the main thing was to obtain political power, and economic and social liberation was still in the future. Although the status of women in our country has been stipulated by law to have the same enjoyment as men, in fact, only a very small part has been achieved, and most of them are still bound and have not achieved equality. Even the entire country has not achieved equality. Therefore, we are holding a commemorative meeting here today. We must base ourselves on the original spirit of the struggle of women in the international community, work hard to seek true liberation, and further seek the liberation of the country, so that the international community can enjoy freedom and equality. This is the significance of holding a commemorative meeting. I hope that female compatriots all over the country will work harder to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>He Xiangning Encourages Women to Work Hard</p>
<p>He Xiangning then gave a speech, saying in brief: When we commemorate the "March 8th" Festival, we think of the immaturity and backwardness of the women's movement in our country, but I believe that the future of our women's community is very promising, because the meaning of commemorating Women's Day is to demand freedom and equality between men and women. As long as we have firm perseverance and a solid spirit, and work hard to move forward, we will naturally achieve our goal. Finally, I wish all my sisters health. After He's speech, Wang Canzhi, Shi Liang, and Mrs. Leisai from the United States successively delivered speeches (details omitted).</p>
<p>Marching in Formation After the Meeting</p>
<p>At a quarter past four, after the meeting was adjourned, the team was organized to march, with the "March 8th" Commemorative Meeting flag leading the way, shouting various slogans along the way. The procession was solemn. First, they set off from Sichuan Road, and there were a large number of police officers maintaining order along the way. The march route was from the YMCA on Sichuan Road, passing through Nanjing Road, Hubei Road, Guangdong Road, Fujian Road, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, south to Minguo Road, Zhonghua Road, Yingxun Road, along Lujiabang Road, straight to Xieqiao Road Plaza for concentration. By the time it was past 7:00 pm, they shouted slogans and dispersed. When passing through the French Concession, there was a slight disturbance, and two people were injured.</p>
<p>Departing in Groups to Townships for Propaganda</p>
<p>In order to celebrate the "March 8th" Festival, the Municipal Women's Federation sent all directors, including Lin Keting, Jin Shiyin, Shu Huizhen, Luo Guangyang, Wang Wenjian, Wang Qiusi, Jin Guangmei, Jin Qingfen, and Zhang Sujun, in ten groups yesterday morning at 7:00 am to various townships to carry out propaganda for women in rural areas. The departure locations included Caojiadu, Pudong, Jiangwan, Wusong, Xujiahui, Beixinjing, Zhenru, Gaochangmiao, Chuansha, Nanhui, Longhua, Caohejing, Yinxianggang, Pengpu, Qingsong, Miaohang, and other places, as well as factories to carry out on-site propaganda on the relationship between the March 8th Festival and society, the country, and the world. The listeners were quite moved. At 1:00 pm, they all returned to Shanghai. At the same time, Mrs. Wu [Mayor's Wife] and Mrs. Cai Yuanpei were invited to broadcast speeches on radio stations such as Yaxing and Da Zhonghua.</p>
<h3>Wood Merchants Along Kuangfu Road, Zhabei, Resume Business This Morning Following Persuasion; Timber Association Sends Letter to Public Security Bureau Requesting Temporary Suspension of Collection; Construction Association Petitions the Mayor for Lenient Handling</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the wood merchants along Kuangfu Road in Zhabei, due to their opposition to the additional housing tax imposed by the Zhabei Collection Office of the Finance Bureau and the detention of the manager of Futai Timber Company, jointly went on strike starting from the 6th of this month. The Timber Trade Association, following the instructions of the Party Headquarters yesterday, persuaded all wood merchants to resume business from today and await resolution. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Trade Association Issues Notice Urging Resumption of Business</p>
<p>More than ten wood merchants, including Yuanxing, Fuji, Xiesheng, Hengxiang, Futai, Ruid, Dachang, Zida, Yuanshun, Yongda, Dafeng, Xianmao, and Xiemao on Kuangfu Road in Zhabei, jointly went on strike starting from the 6th of this month due to their opposition to the additional housing tax imposed by the North Shanghai Collection Office and the detention of merchants, which caused public discontent. They also submitted petitions to various authorities. The Party Headquarters has instructed the trade association to order all wood merchants to resume business first and await resolution. The Timber Trade Association specifically notified all wood merchants to resume business as usual this morning. The notice stated: "We have received instructions from the Shanghai Party Headquarters and a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (details omitted), etc. Having received this, and considering that the illegal actions of Li Shaobin, the director of the North Shanghai Collection Office, are being handled by the Party and government authorities according to law, we should comply with the aforementioned instructions and letter and resume business immediately, awaiting legal action. This is hereby notified."</p>
<p>Letter to Public Security Bureau Requesting Temporary Suspension of Collection</p>
<p>Xu Zuoliang, the acting lawyer of the Timber Trade Association, sent a letter to Cai, the Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, yesterday, stating: "Regarding the case of Li Shaobin, the director of the North Shanghai Collection Office, overcharging donations and abusing detention against Chen Qizhang, the manager of Futai Timber Company, which has aroused public anger and caused more than ten wood merchants in Zhabei to suspend business and submit petitions for correction and punishment, it has been found that Director Li Shaobin's various actions do constitute crimes under Article 302, Paragraph 1, and Article 129 of the Criminal Law. This lawyer has been entrusted by the victim to draft a complaint to the competent court to file a private prosecution, requesting punishment. This letter is to request that the pursuit of donations from Chen Qizhang be suspended pending the court's judgment in order to maintain the rule of law. Respectfully yours to Cai, Director of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau."</p>
<p>Construction Association's Letter to the Mayor</p>
<p>Zhang Xiaoliang, the chairman of the Construction Factory Trade Association, wrote to Mayor Wu yesterday, stating: "Honorable Mayor Wu, respectfully, the wood merchants along Kuangfu Road in Zhabei are unable to bear the North Shanghai Collection Office's retroactive collection of housing taxes and illegal arrests, which has caused public outrage and a collective suspension of business. It is said that they have gone to your office to petition and await resolution. I also belong to the wood industry and am well aware that the market is declining year by year, and all industries are in recession. Construction has stopped, and the wood industry has plummeted. The fellow merchants all have difficulties maintaining their businesses. Moreover, the law should not be retroactive, and benevolent governance should not be demanding. Paying taxes is indeed the duty of the people, but increasing taxes should be adjusted according to the prosperity or decline of the market. If it is too hasty, it may not be practically helpful but may instead shake the foundation. If the wood industry dispute cannot be resolved for a time, it may indirectly cause panic among civil engineering laborers, which is of great importance to social stability. Our mayor has always been concerned about promoting market prosperity and revitalizing people's livelihoods, and should be able to see this clearly. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble suggestions and respectfully request that you consider and instruct the Finance Bureau to handle the matter leniently and not be too strict, so that the citizens will be grateful forever. I am in fear and await your orders." The Timber Trade Association also submitted another request to the Party and government to thoroughly investigate, the original text of which is lengthy and omitted.</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Addresses the True Situation of Housing Taxes for Wood Merchants</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike of wood merchants in Zhabei in opposition to the additional housing tax, a person in charge of the Finance Bureau said yesterday: "Most of the wood merchants along Kuangfu Road are operating on leased land. They have always concealed 70-80% of their rental income when reporting and paying housing taxes. This time, the citywide investigation of rents revealed the true rents of these wood merchants. The recorded rent amounts exceeded the declared rent amounts by several times, and many were signed and certified by the landlords. Therefore, the Finance Bureau corrected the tax collection based on these rent amounts. Naturally, the numbers are quite different from the previous tax amounts paid by the wood merchants. However, the smallness of the previous tax amounts paid by the wood merchants was due to concealment and was not legitimate. The largeness of today's tax amounts is due to correction and not an increase. Many people in the wood merchant community understand this, so many have voluntarily signed and acknowledged that the corrected tax amounts are fair. Only a few are advocating opposition because they cannot maintain their improper gains from concealing taxes. The North Shanghai Collection Office received an order from the bureau to strictly pursue the matter in December of last year, and has repeatedly advised them, but they all remained hesitant. In February of this year, the Timber Trade Association sent representative Huang Shouji to the North Shanghai Collection Office, requesting an extension, until the end of February, for everyone to resolve the matter together. However, by the beginning of March, there was still no response. The North Shanghai Collection Office had no choice but to issue summons separately. Futai Sen leased land from Renhe Company in March of the 23rd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1934] to build houses, with an annual land rent of 2,000 yuan, as certified by Renhe Company. The average monthly land rent is 166 yuan and 67 cents. Four two-story buildings were built, each estimated to have a monthly rent of 8 yuan, totaling 32 yuan. The total monthly rent is 198 yuan and 67 cents. Collecting taxes based on this is extremely fair. However, Futai Sen previously falsely claimed self-production and concealed the rented land, paying taxes based on an estimated rent of 50 yuan per month. Comparing the two, they naturally feel a difference between the past and the present. They do not realize that the past was concealment and tax evasion. The concealed portion is being pursued to be paid retroactively from the date of establishment in the 23rd year, and a penalty should be imposed for failing to come to the bureau to correct the tax amount within the prescribed deadline. All of these are stipulated in the measures for investigating rents and are not inappropriate. When Chen Qizhang, the manager of Futai Sen, was summoned to the office, he initially agreed to sign a ten-day promissory note to pay, but then went back on his word. This was too unreasonable. As a last resort, the police were sent to coerce payment. This is the usual procedure for handling tax resistance and is nothing special. The wood merchants are using this as a pretext to suspend business, which is close to unreasonable coercion. It is said that the Finance Authorities have already established normal methods to resolve the matter, etc."</p>

<h3>Three Types of National Bonds to Be Drawn for Redemption Tomorrow; At the Banking Association at 10:00 AM</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation issued 10 million yuan of the 24th Year (of the Republic, i.e., 1935) Telecommunications National Bonds in October of last year. 6 million yuan in cash has been borrowed from the China Communications and Postal Bank Consortium to improve and expand telegraph and long-distance telephone services. According to the regulations, March, June, September, and December of each year are the periods for principal and interest redemption. The drawing will be held at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month at the Shanghai Hong Kong Road Banking Association. The Ministry of Transportation has sent Wen Qing, the Director of the Telecommunications Department, and Shen Shuyu, the Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, to supervise. Mr. Wen is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing tomorrow. According to regulations, the principal and interest redemption for this period is 12%, which is 1.2 million yuan. Winning bonds will be redeemed for principal and interest by the Ministry of Transportation's Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau starting at the end of this month. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has also scheduled the redemption drawing for the 24th installment of the Post-War Short-Term National Bonds and the 5th installment of the 17th Year (of the Republic, i.e., 1928) Long-Term Financial National Bonds to be held at 10:00 AM tomorrow at the Shanghai Banking Association. However, since the Post-War Short-Term National Bond redemption is the last installment, there is no need for a drawing. Representatives from various agencies will be present to supervise to ensure solemnity.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special District Court Agreement to Expire Twice This Year</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News Agency, inquiring about the truth of the impending expiration of the agreement, learned from judicial circles yesterday that since the Opium War, the legal rights of the Shanghai Concession had been lost due to consular jurisdiction. In the 7th year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1868), the Mixed Court was established, but all judicial powers were entirely in the hands of foreigners. It was not until the years of the Republic of China from the 1st to the 15th year that the government, after several negotiations, signed the Provisional Court Agreement for the Shanghai Concession. On January 1st of the 16th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1927], the Mixed Court was renamed the Provisional Court, with a valid term of three years. When it expired in the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929], the Ministry of Judicial Administration continued negotiations and established the Special District Court Agreement. On April 1st of that year, in accordance with the agreement, the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Shanghai Special District Local Court. In April of the 22nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1933], it was extended for another three years. Until now, the agreement has expired twice.</p>
<h3>American Birth Control Advocate Mrs. Sanger Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; To Sail to Honolulu on the Same Ship This Morning; Mrs. Martin to Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>American birth control advocate Margaret Sanger is on another world tour. After giving several lectures in India, she arrived in Hong Kong last month. Due to banquets and colds, her trip to Shanghai was postponed several times. She finally departed from Hong Kong on the Changxing Steamship Company's Japanese Empress liner on the 6th. The ship docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 1:00 PM yesterday. Mrs. Sanger will stay in Shanghai for one night and sail east on the same ship tomorrow morning. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanger occupied first-class cabin number 107 on the ship. Her only companion was her secretary, Miss Phillip. Mrs. Sanger is in her forties and wears a black regular dress and a leopard-skin coat. Due to illness, her complexion did not appear very healthy, but her demeanor still retained the true nature of a women's movement activist. Mrs. Sanger originally planned to give a lecture in Shanghai, but she has now canceled it. She is scheduled to sail east on the original ship tomorrow morning, planning to take a short trip to Honolulu. Yesterday was International Women's Day, and those who originally planned to welcome her at the wharf did not arrive due to attending meetings. Only Zhou Zhonghuiqing of the Women's Temperance Association and Yan Fuqing led his daughter to greet her.</p>
<p>Reasons for Birth Control</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Sanger, speaking to the Central News Agency, I started advocating birth control in 1914. From 1916 to this year, for these twenty years, I have been dedicated to advocating birth control. However, there are many people in the world who do not understand my views and misunderstand them, and some even oppose them. In fact, my birth control advocacy has seven major reasons: To prevent those with hidden diseases or venereal diseases from passing them on to their children. To prevent women suffering from lung disease, stomach disease, and heart disease from being difficult to treat after pregnancy. To prevent men and women with healthy appearances from giving birth to foolish children. To allow healthy women to rest between births to maintain their health. To prevent those with limited economic ability to raise only a certain number of children (such as one or two) from having more than this number, causing pain to both parents and children. To avoid unhealthy children being born when some men and women have not fully developed and engage in sexual activity. After marriage, couples who do not yet have a deep understanding of each other should avoid having children to reduce family disputes. In short, my advocacy is by no means for absolute birth control, but for controlling the number of children born according to the circumstances of each family.</p>
<p>Birth Control Methods</p>
<p>As for birth control methods, there are three main categories: Absolute abstinence from reproduction, eliminating marriage. Permanent contraception. Using various scientific methods of birth control. All birth control methods are guided by doctors.</p>
<p>Landing for a Banquet</p>
<p>Mrs. Sanger and her female secretary, Miss Phillip, landed under the guidance of Zhou Zhonghuiqing and took a Xiang Sheng automobile to the tea party at the residence of Dr. Wang Yihui on Bailinan Road. Those present included Yan Fuqing, Luo Fuhua, Zhou Zhonghuiqing, Mrs. Zhou Zipei, Ms. Liang Fulian, Hu Zhujun, Mrs. Wu Jingqi, etc., all of whom are doctors and researchers of birth control. After the evening banquet, they boarded the ship to await departure at 8:00 AM this morning. (According to another message, Mrs. Sanger will come to China again in September.)</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin to Arrive Soon</p>
<p>According to Mrs. Sanger, Mrs. Martin, a famous British birth control advocate, is currently in Hong Kong and will soon travel north to Shanghai, where she may give a public lecture.</p>

<h3>Fish Merchants Along the Yangtze and Coastal Areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Request Issuance of Public Bonds for Relief</h3>
<p>Enumerating Many Key Points for Revitalizing the Fishing Industry; Annual Fish Production Can Reach Over 100 Million</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, the Shanghai Fishing Vessel Industry Association, the Shanghai Fish Market Preparation Committee, Yu Hede, the Chairman of the Ningbo Shanghai Association, Liu Hongsheng, the Chairman of the Dinghai Shanghai Association, and the Fishery Associations of more than 20 counties along the Yangtze and coastal areas, including Changshu, Yancheng, Nantong, Chongming, Nanhui, Dongtai, Songjiang, and Haimen in Jiangsu Province, stated that in the provinces and cities along the Yangtze and coastal areas of China, no less than ten million people rely on the fishing industry for their livelihoods, either directly or indirectly. The annual value of fish production reaches over 300 million yuan. In recent years, agriculture and commerce have declined, and social finance has dried up. The organization of fishing villages has also collapsed. If no relief measures are planned, not only will fishing boats be unable to go out to sea for operations, but foreign ships will also be allowed to fish arbitrarily, endangering local stability and affecting the social economy. Therefore, they have jointly submitted a request to the Ministries of Industry and Finance, specifically requesting the Central Government to issue fishery public bonds or devise a fundamental relief plan. The proposed methods and opinions of the various fishery associations and public organizations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Economic Situation of the Fishing Industry in Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>The fishing industry in Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, is the best in the country, and Shenjiamen is considered to be the gathering area for fishermen. During each winter fishing season, there are more than 1,200 pairs of large boats that go out to sea for fishing. With an average production of 5,000 yuan per pair, the total catch is no less than 6 million yuan. However, before going out to sea, it is necessary to raise fishing capital, such as labor, boat rental, firewood, rice, tung oil, hemp rope, nets, etc. Each large boat requires 1,500 yuan of fishing capital, totaling more than 1.8 million yuan. This fishing capital has traditionally been lent to fish merchants by the silver and money industries in Ningbo and Shenjiamen, and then lent by the fish merchants to the fishermen. After the catch is sold, the principal and interest are repaid. This has become a common practice.</p>
<p>Public Organizations and Merchants Gather to Loan Money for Relief</p>
<p>Recently, due to the impact of the current social depression, financial stagnation, and tight lending, the silver and money industries have been unable to circulate funds, and the fishing merchants have been unable to turn around funds. The fishing season has been missed as a result. The production of fishing operations worth millions of yuan has been abandoned in the sea, and hundreds of thousands of poor fishermen have no way to live, even being forced by hunger and cold to become pirates, causing disaster in the local area. Therefore, after gathering discussions with public organizations and merchants, it is proposed to follow the Ministry of Finance's relief measures for industry and commerce, requesting the Central Government to allocate public bonds or fishery public bonds of 2 million yuan to organize a Loan Fund Management Committee to lend to fish merchants. The loan period is limited to one year. The production of yellow croaker worth 3 million yuan will be temporarily used as collateral. When the loans are collected by the fish merchants at the end of the term, in addition to mortgaging movable and immovable property in the urban area, reliable shopkeepers will also be taken as guarantors to ensure the stability of the fund and prevent the funds from being wasted.</p>
<p>Fishermen Do Not Worry About Losses When Borrowing Money</p>
<p>The local fishery associations advocate requesting the government to allocate several million yuan from the issued public bonds or any public funds to be issued and deposit them in various banks that handle rural loans to lend to fishermen as capital for fishing boats to go out to sea. As for the life in fishing villages, it is not as stable as that of farmers. Every year when fishing boats go out to sea, there are inevitable risks of encountering wind and theft. The lender should seek compensation for such losses. It is proposed that the Ministry of Finance add one dime or nine cents per dan [a unit of weight] to the salt tax to offset the losses of fishermen's loans. This is a safe way to provide relief and can preserve a position of credit for those who lend to fishermen.</p>
<p>Protection of Fishermen and Elimination of Pirates Rely on Customs</p>
<p>Regarding the general causes of the decline of the fishing industry, it is not limited to the fishing aspect. Transportation and manufacturing are also extremely important. It seems that the government should also find ways to provide relief in order to fundamentally revitalize the industry. It is proposed that the government follow the example of the flood relief surcharge and levy an additional 1-2% on the import tax of aquatic products at customs to be used for the revitalization of coastal fishing villages and for relief and improvement of fishing technology. In this way, not only can fishermen live and work in peace and benefit, but also the sea pirates will be eliminated and the safety of coastal trade will be maintained. The customs are expected to be happy to support this. It is heard that the Ministries of Finance and Industry believe that the above-mentioned are essential measures for the current relief of the fishing industry, so they will send personnel to jointly plan the measures.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company Notifies Users to Save on Basic Telephone Charges; Sends Letter to Bar Association to Inquire About Measures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special District Telephone Problem Committee sent a letter to the Bar Association yesterday, inquiring about the measures to deal with the telephone per-call charging method, and notified telephone users of the measures to save on basic telephone charges. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Letter to the Bar Association</p>
<p>With respect, having read the newspaper, we learned that the telephone installed in the lawyers' lounge of the Bar Association makes as many as 70 calls per day, and that the Bar Association will discuss measures to deal with this, etc. Telephones are a public utility and not a private profit-making institution. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company relies on the franchise contract signed with the Municipal Council to take whatever it wants, regardless of public anger, and running counter to the market situation, in order to satisfy its own official profit. When others infringe on our rights, we have no room to resist. In addition to requesting the government to estimate the company's assets and issue telephone public bonds to evaluate and recover the company, we are still contacting various public organizations in the city to persevere to the end and deal with this together. If your association has discussed effective measures, please inform us. Our associations are in the same boat and should work together to overcome this.</p>
<p>Notice to All Users</p>
<p>With respect, according to the suggestion of our committee member Li Kuikui, each telephone is subject to a basic telephone charge of 5.5 yuan for businesses and 3.5 yuan for residences. For example, if there are ten telephones in a certain alley, if these ten households can share one telephone and remove the other nine, they can reduce the basic telephone charge by 31.5 yuan. If ten shops reduce one telephone, they can save as much as 49.5 yuan in basic telephone charges. With the money saved, it is more than enough to hire a telephone operator. The suggestion has been brought to the committee. This method is indeed a temporary expedient. We hereby request your users to discuss cost-saving measures with nearby neighbors and act accordingly.</p>

<h3>Jiaotong Bank Promotes Rural Loans</h3>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Jiaotong Bank has recently attached great importance to rural loans and is actively promoting them. The relevant news is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Qimen Tea Farm</p>
<p>The Agricultural Department of the National Economic Council, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, and the Anhui Construction Department have jointly established the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm to improve Qimen black tea. It is reported that the director of the farm, Hu Haochuan, and Ling Jinsong, the section chief of the Agricultural Department of the Economic Council, specialist Zeng Bangxi, Zhang Peishen, the business manager of Jiaotong Bank, and Wu Linbai, the agricultural loan specialist, jointly discussed the loan methods for the Qimen Tea Cooperative. The total amount is 400,000 yuan for production loans and 600,000 yuan for transportation and sales loans, and it is stipulated that they will cooperate with each other. (A) In terms of production technology, the Qimen Tea Improvement Farm will be responsible for guidance. (B) In terms of transportation and sales, the Agricultural Department will appoint four specialists to be responsible for handling it. Jiaotong Bank will be responsible for lending and will set up a temporary office in Qimen to coordinate. It is reported that the loan interest rate is only 8% per month, and this plan has been approved by the Board of Directors of Jiaotong Bank for a trial run.</p>
<p>Xishi Experimental Area</p>
<p>More than 20 newly established rural cooperatives in the Huibei Mass Education Experimental Area of the Wuxi Education College have been established recently. Gao Yang, the president of the Education College, and Yu Rensheng, the director of the Experimental Area, have sent a letter to the head office of Jiaotong Bank in this city, requesting loans. Tang Shoumin, the general manager of the bank, has agreed to provide loans. It is reported that the total amount is about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan, which will be lent directly by the Shanghai head office.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton Planting</p>
<p>Agricultural loans in various counties of Shaanxi Province are handled by various banks separately. Jiaotong Bank is responsible for lending to five rural credit cooperatives, namely Dali, Ganyi, Xianyang, Wugong, and Xingping. Last year, the investment was about 300,000 yuan. The Shaanxi Cooperative Affairs Bureau is responsible for guidance. The opium in the five counties has been banned and replaced by cotton planting. The cotton seeds are supplied by the Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute, and the loans are provided by Jiaotong Bank, totaling about 200,000 yuan. The detailed methods are being discussed and implemented.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Baxianqiao YMCA originally scheduled a speech on "The European Situation and the Far East Question" the night before last, inviting Mr. Zhang Mingyang to be the speaker. Beforehand, the political department of the French Concession police sent personnel to stop it. The association temporarily announced a change of topic and postponed the event. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the association invited Zhang Shizhang, the editor of the Youth Association, to give a speech on "Myth and Superstition in Religion." Mr. Zhang, with a scientific, objective, and scholarly attitude, without any prejudice, explained in detail the definitions of religion, myth, and superstition, as well as the evolution of religion, the causes and categories of myth and superstition, and the myths and superstitions of various religions. He said that the existence of religion cannot rely on superstition and myth, but on psychological, social, and ethical foundations.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Public Association Suggests Food Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Three Methods of Contribution were Submitted to the Executive Yuan. Farmers Lack the Ability to Fertilize, Please Provide Fundamental Relief.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association submitted a document to the Executive Yuan of the National Government yesterday, stating: "To the Honorable Executive Yuan of the National Government,</p>
<p>Our country</p>
<p>is founded on agriculture.</p>
<p>The people's food has always relied on self-sufficiency. In the early years of the Republic of China, there was even surplus rice for sale, supplying neighboring countries. However, in recent years, food has become increasingly insufficient, with significant annual imports of rice and wheat. According to customs reports, food imports last year reached more than 155,591,000 yuan, accounting for four-tenths of the total import surplus, which is alarming. If measures are not taken to remedy this, it will be difficult to balance international payments in peacetime. If an emergency occurs and maritime transportation is blocked, the source of rice and wheat will be cut off, and urban residents may</p>
<p>all starve to death.</p>
<p>Military supplies will become a problem. Looking ahead, there is no greater danger than this. The current lack of rice and grain is definitely not due to the large number of eaters. Exploring the root cause, natural disasters such as floods and droughts are indeed one of the reasons. However, in the years of the Republic of China 21 and 22, all provinces reported bumper harvests. Why are rice and wheat still being imported? It can be seen that the biggest reason is the bankruptcy of rural areas. Farmers cannot afford to fertilize, and good farmland is gradually becoming barren, resulting in a sharp decline in production. According to national</p>
<p>paddy and dry fields,</p>
<p>the total is more than 133.2 million mu. Assuming that 70% is planted with rice and wheat, if each mu yields one dou less, the total reduction is more than 90 million shi. No wonder what was once abundant is now deficient. The fundamental economic solution should be to use scientific methods to improve seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, and management. It is not difficult to double the yield. A comprehensive plan, with a loan of five yuan per mu for the above-mentioned improvements, would require 670 million yuan. The association previously suggested to the Sixth National Congress that banknotes worth 500 million yuan be issued to relieve rural areas. This is not an exaggeration. However, in the</p>
<p>currency reform,</p>
<p>the currency may inflate, which may cause social panic. A temporary solution may be implemented first. Focus on the paddy field portion, loaning fertilizers worth about two yuan per mu. According to the experience of old farmers, applying one soybean cake per mu can increase the yield of brown rice by five dou. There are more than 33 million mu of paddy fields in the country, which can increase the total by more than 160 million shi. What is currently lacking each year is less than 20 million shi. With a shift, the deficit can be turned into a surplus. Sufficient food leads to sufficient soldiers, and self-defense must start with self-sufficiency. This is a major plan for saving the nation and ensuring survival. We dare not hesitate to present our humble suggestions.</p>
<p>The proposed methods</p>
<p>are as follows: The total amount of the loan is set at 650 million yuan. According to the paddy fields in each province, excluding the four northeastern provinces and Xinjiang, which are too far to reach, there are a total of more than 32.7 million mu of paddy fields. Loaning two yuan per mu requires the above amount. The required funds are provided by the following sources: The Agricultural Bank of China issues new banknotes worth 100 million yuan; Transfer 250 million yuan of the National Reconstruction Bonds to exchange for Central Bank banknotes; The Agricultural Bank of China issues agricultural circulation notes worth 200 million yuan. These circulation notes are stamped with place names and can only be used locally, and cannot directly</p>
<p>purchase foreign exchange,</p>
<p>but must be recovered once a year. Loan methods: 1. Purchase artificial fertilizers and sell them to farmers at the original price. 2. Farmers who make their own natural fertilizers, such as river mud, aquatic plants, human manure, and animal bones, are loaned cash according to the cost they need. (For detailed methods, please refer to the loan methods in Section 9 of Chapter 5 of Chu Fucheng's "Currency Revolution"). At this time of national crisis and the survival of the nation, the association believes that the most urgent and fundamental plan for saving the country is to increase farmers' production. We hereby submit our suggestions and earnestly request their adoption and implementation. We await your orders with the utmost urgency. The Shanghai Zhejiang Public Association kowtows.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Zhang Replies to the Xiuning Fellow Countrymen Association</h3>
<p>The Xiuning Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai, due to repeated reports of bandits frequently appearing and causing great harm in their hometown, recently telegraphed the General Command of Bandit Suppression in the Border Area of the Four Provinces, ordering the stationed troops to work hard to eliminate the bandits and ensure the people's livelihood. Yesterday, they received a reply from Commander-in-Chief Zhang, stating: "To the Xiuning Fellow Countrymen Association in Shanghai, I have read your telegram. The bandit situation in the Xiuning and Wuyuan areas is still rampant. I feel deeply concerned about the suffering people. As it is my duty, I will do my best to work hard on this. I hope that the gentlemen of Xiuning in Shanghai will not worry. I am writing to inform you. Zhang Fakui, Jiang Can's seal."</p>

<h3>Lawyers' Association Submits Resolutions for Adoption - Advocates for Probation, Exemption of File Inspection Fees, and Reduction of Paper Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association submitted many proposals at the 7th National Lawyers' Association Congress of the Republic of China. The important resolutions passed by the Congress are now being jointly submitted to the Legislative and Judicial Yuan by the standing committee members and the secretary-general for adoption and implementation. The details of each case are as follows:</p>
<p>Please advise all courts to pay attention to the probation system in Article 74 of the Criminal Law. Article 74 of the new Criminal Law stipulates that probation may be granted to those who have not been sentenced to imprisonment. In recent years, very few courts have granted probation, making this article practically non-existent. A request should be submitted to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, instructing all courts to pay special attention. For those who do not grant probation, the reasons should be stated in the judgment.</p>
<p>The court should not charge application fees for lawyers' requests to inspect files. Lawyers, prosecutors, and judges are the three major duties in the judiciary. A lawyer's right to inspect files is just like a judge or prosecutor's right to inspect files. Both are duties that should be performed, just like a lawyer's appearance in court for civil cases to present opinions, and appearance in court for criminal defense, are of the same nature and duty. Now, the court uniquely charges an application fee of 75 cents each time for the act of file inspection, which is theoretically unacceptable.</p>
<p>Suggest ordering all courts in the country to sell litigation documents at the actual cost price. The prices of litigation documents issued by courts in our country vary from province to province. For example, in Jiangsu Province, civil litigation documents are sold for 90 cents, and criminal litigation documents are sold for 45 cents. In Zhejiang, civil litigation documents are sold for 60 cents, and criminal litigation documents are sold for 30 cents. This not only places an unfair burden on the people, with differences within a short distance, but also shows the lack of unity in our country's politics. Even with the sanctity of the judiciary, even such trivial matters as litigation documents cannot be standardized. Moreover, the cost of the litigation documents is estimated to be only four or five cents. The court should not operate for profit. It does not seem appropriate to sell a litigation document that costs four or five cents for 90 cents or 60 cents, or 45 cents or 30 cents. Even if the judicial funding is insufficient, the government should find a way to allocate it. If absolutely necessary to collect from the people, it should be clearly stipulated in laws and regulations and officially collected. It does not seem appropriate to borrow the name, raise the price of the paper, and engage in acts close to commodity patents, arbitrarily increasing prices, leaving a stain on the judicial organs. This should be corrected. (The above three items) were proposed by the Shanghai Lawyers' Association.</p>
<p>The five lawyers' associations of Hang County, Yongjia, Jinhua, You County, and Xiaoshan proposed an urgent motion to request the Congress to assist Lawyer Huang Weishi, a member of the Jinhua Lawyers' Association's Legal Aid Association for the Poor. The relevant authorities have been requested to adopt and implement the proposal.</p>
<h3>Li Tingan to Arrive in Shanghai on the 12th</h3>
<p>Li Tingan, the Director of the Shanghai Health Bureau, went abroad to conduct inspections and traveled extensively to various European and American countries for several months. He collected detailed information on the health facilities of various countries. Mr. Li has now completed his work and is returning to China on the North German Company's mail ship Scharnhorst. It is expected that he will arrive at the port on the 12th of this month. It is reported that after arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Li will cancel his leave and resume his duties, and will compile the inspection materials and submit them to the competent authorities as a basis for improvement.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Postpones Trip to Henan and Shaanxi</h3>

<h3>Eurasia Company - The Nanjing-Yunnan Line Still Needs a Trial Flight - The Details of This Trial Flight Have Been Submitted to the Ministry for Review</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's newly opened Nanjing-Yunnan line, since the company's aviation team dispatched Ren Henzhou to drive the Junkers Ju 52 aircraft for a trial flight and returned to Shanghai on the 4th of this month, has been several days. According to the company's news, this trial flight was unable to travel to Nanjing via Guiyang, Changsha, and Nanchang on the original route due to bad weather in Guiyang, and returned to Shanghai via Chengdu and Xi'an. The details of the trial flight have now been submitted to the ministry for review. It is said that when the weather on that side improves, another trial flight will be scheduled.</p>

<h3>Korean Anarchists Form the South China Korean Youth League</h3>
<p>According to the Foreign News Agency, the Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News reported that a group of Korean anarchists in Shanghai organized the "South China Korean Youth League," striving to obtain comrades and promote their ideology. In 1932, they organized a terrorist group called the "Black Terror Group." In March 1933, they attempted to assassinate Akira Ariyoshi, the Japanese Ambassador to China at the time. In August of the same year, they assassinated Yu Guabin in the French Concession. In 1935, they shot and killed Li Yonglu, the President of the Korean Association in Shanghai. Recently, they contacted a certain person who infiltrated Nanjing and others to organize the "Mengbei Corps," extorting money from powerful Koreans. After receiving this information, the Japanese Consulate General Police had already been on alert. On February 22, the captain of the Mengbei Corps ordered a gun to be smuggled into Zhang Douzhie's residence on Jing'an Road. As a result, he was arrested by the French Concession police and sent to the Japanese consulate for questioning. Their secrets were completely exposed. It is said that the Japanese Consulate will soon take concrete actions to eliminate these unstable elements.</p>
<h3>Ink-Making Workers' Strike in Wuyuan - Part of Them Resumed Work Yesterday - The Unresolved Are Waiting for Party and Government Mediation</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, all 60-plus ink-making workers from Wuyuan in Shanghai announced an automatic strike four days ago to protest the employer's reduction of wages. The Party and government authorities were deeply concerned about the expansion of the strike and ordered the Ink-Making Workers' Union to persuade them to resume work. After receiving the order, the union proceeded to mediate. It is learned that the employers of ink shops such as Lang Guishan and Shi Yongyou, out of consideration for the workers' difficulties, have agreed to continue paying wages at the original rate. Therefore, the workers of these two shops resumed work as usual yesterday. The other unresolved shops are waiting for mediation by the superior authorities in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Goods Relief Association Established Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Jiangyin Compatriots: Yesterday's Memorial Service for Liu Yongkang Attended by Over 1,000 Compatriots and Guests; Three Shanghai-Based Organizations Held Separate Tributes</h3>
<p>Liu Yongkang of Jiangyin, courtesy name Shanpu, resided in Shanghai for nearly 30 years. He started his career in industry and commerce and was known for his generosity and philanthropy. He readily assisted compatriots in distress to the best of his ability and was especially enthusiastic about public welfare, such as the construction of the Jiangyin Guild Hall and the organization of the Jiangyin Shanghai Compatriots Association, contributing significantly to these endeavors. He also provided substantial support to the World Red Swastika Society. Sadly, fate did not favor this benevolent man, and he passed away in Shanghai last winter at the young age of 52, deeply mourned by his fellow villagers. This spring, the Jiangyin Guild Hall, the Jiangyin Shanghai Compatriots Association, and the Jiangyin Shanghai Students Association jointly initiated a memorial service. Representatives from the three organizations were selected to form a memorial service preparation committee, which included general affairs, documentation, and public relations divisions. Xi Rungeng, Cui Fuzhuang, Guo Boliang, Xue Jinquan, and Zhang Yaozong were appointed to handle general affairs; Cao Yinfu, Zhuang Xiangsheng, Xu Zhengji, Xu Juezi, and Zhu Mingfei were in charge of documentation; and Li Zhiyun, Yao Yongping, Yu Weiqing, Tang Jisheng, and Sun Yucai managed public relations. After more than a month of preparations, the memorial service was held yesterday at 1:00 PM in the grand auditorium of the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. The venue had been decorated two days prior, with lanterns and colorful decorations adorning the entrance, and a banner reading "Memorial Service for Mr. Liu Yongkang of Jiangyin" prominently displayed on the archway. Inside, couplets, scrolls, horizontal banners, and other items were lavishly displayed, creating a beautiful spectacle. A portrait of the deceased was hung in the center of the stage, flanked by memorial texts and other inscriptions. An altar was set up in front, adorned with fruits and sacrificial dishes. Six large wreaths and one small wreath were placed in front of the altar, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. Over 1,000 people attended the memorial service, including dozens of representatives from Jiangyin such as Chen Meichu, Lu Junxiu, and Han Xuean, the entire faculty and students of Jiangyin schools in Shanghai, various Jiangyin organizations in Shanghai, and Zhang Lanbin, a representative of the World Red Swastika Society. The gathering was a grand spectacle. The order of the meeting was as follows: The bell rang to commence the meeting. The entire assembly stood at attention. Mournful music was played. The memorial song was sung. The assembly paid their highest respects to the portrait of Mr. Liu. Chairman Xi Rungeng reported on Mr. Liu's life. Speeches were given by fellow villagers Li Zhiyun, Xia Sunhuan, Lu Junxiu, Guo Qiyuan, Ge Fengchi, Xue Jinquan, and Zhang Lanbin, a representative of the World Red Swastika Society. Lu Junxiu's speech was particularly insightful, stating that Mr. Yongkang's enthusiasm for public welfare and generosity were well-known, but his investments in public welfare and charitable endeavors paled in comparison to those of the late compatriot Xue Fengquan. However, after Xue's death, his fellow villagers remained silent, while they mourned Mr. Liu to the fullest extent. Although both performed good deeds, one was passive, and the other was active. One relied solely on financial resources, while the other combined financial resources with human effort. Thus, Xue only experienced glory in life, while Mr. Liu experienced both glory in life and sorrow in death. Tributes were offered. First, Xi Xian (representing Shao Fu) of the Jiangyin Guild Hall presided over the tribute, with Ge Fengchi, Guo Boliang, Xia Sunhuan, and Cui Fuzhuang as attendants, and Cao Yaoqin read the memorial text. Next, Xi Rungeng of the Jiangyin Shanghai Compatriots Association presided over the tribute, with Guo Qiyuan, Zhang Yaozong, Yu Weiqing, and Tang Jisheng as attendants, and Xu Juezi read the memorial text. Finally, Li Zhiyun of the Jiangyin Shanghai Students Association presided over the tribute, with Xu Zhengji, Sun Yucai, Gu Zenghua, and Wu Jize as attendants, and Xu Butang read the memorial text. The family gave a response, with Yongkang's younger brother, Jikang, delivering the reply. Mournful music was played. The ceremony concluded.</p>

<h3>Special Mausoleum Trains to Be Added Starting Today; Personnel Dispatched from the Nanjing Station to Take Care of Everything</h3>

<h3>Ding Jinhai Has Malicious Intentions; Copper Apprentice Lured Away; Zhu Lansheng Reports to the Police for Search; Arrested and Handed Over to the Bureau for Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhu Lansheng, 31 years old, a coppersmith from Pudong who runs his business at No. 9, Nanri Lane, Guohuo Road, Nanshi, took in an apprentice last year named Yin Lianbao, 18 years old from Changzhou. He was diligent in his work and highly appreciated by Zhu. A few days ago, he suddenly disappeared. Zhu searched everywhere but could not find him. Later, he learned that Ding Jinhai, 23 years old from Changshu, had used sweet talk to lure him away and was hiding him at No. 49, Mutao Lane, Lujiabang, Nanshi. He reported this to the local police station, which dispatched officers to arrest Ding at the address. At the same time, the apprentice Yin Lianbao was found inside. They were both taken to the station for questioning. According to the apprentice, on the third night of this month in the old calendar, at about 9 o'clock, Ding suddenly came to find me and said, "You work very hard here. I have a good friend who can introduce you to the Yidong Foundry. You only need to study for two months, and then you can get paid." At that time, I believed him and went with him to the place, but there was no such thing in the factory. He then went out to gather hooligans to scare and confine me, not letting me leave. When questioned, the defendant cunningly refused to admit it. Since the matter concerned conspiracy and deception, he has been handed over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

After nearly an hour, they finally looted to their fill and left. After the bandits left, the occupants immediately tracked them down to the nearby police post and reported the incident. The officers at the Linping Road Nos. 28 and 29 police post, Jia Hongkui and Xu Zhiren, received the report and immediately joined forces with special gun-carrying officers to pursue them. In desperation, the bandits opened fire on the police. Officers Jia and Xu immediately returned fire and bravely chased after them, capturing one bandit alive.

<h3>Song Quansheng and Others' Assault Case; Zhang Jinhai Dies from Serious Injuries</h3>
<p>Qian Yinsheng, who runs a teahouse in Niqiangquan, Pudong, has long had a feud with Yang. At 2:00 PM on the 16th of last month, Yang and a group of people including Song Quansheng, each wielding weapons and handguns, stormed into the teahouse seeking revenge. They fired shots as a warning, and a bullet hit Zhang Jinhai (from Yangzhou), the barber in the teahouse, in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground injured. Qian Yinsheng was also struck in the left foot with an ax. Realizing they had caused trouble, they scattered and fled. The family members immediately sent the injured to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Afterwards, the local police station arrested Song Quansheng and handed him over to the prosecutor's office of the District Court. The case was tried publicly by Judge Zhang Peiming in the criminal court, but no verdict was reached. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Zhang Jinhai's injuries were in the abdomen. Doctors found that his intestines were pierced, and his injuries were extremely dangerous and irreparable. He died in the hospital the day before yesterday. The local bailiff, Qin Defang, reported this to the District Court, requesting an autopsy.

As they were leaving with the loot, Hu Jinlian, the daughter of the hotel owner Hu Shunliang, shouted "Thief!" in desperation, angering the robbers. They pulled out sharp knives and stabbed the woman in the left shoulder and back, causing blood to flow profusely. In extreme pain, she fell to the ground. The robbers then fled through the door and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, Hu immediately reported to the local police station and requested them to pursue the robbers.

<h3>Ma Houtian Splits Auxiliary Currency in Half; Police Station Orders Him to Demonstrate Alteration Skills; Judge Sentences Ma to Two Years and Six Months</h3>
<p>Ma Houtian, a beggar from Yangzhou, recently racked his brains and devised a way to split the auxiliary currency issued by the Central Bank into two halves. He then pasted a piece of newspaper onto each half, using each bill as two. Shopkeepers and vendors, if not careful, were often fooled. Recently, Detective Li Chunrong of the Des Voeux Road Police Station and Western officer No. 93 apprehended Ma at Hengbang Bridge on North Sichuan Road. They found a torn auxiliary currency bill with newspaper pasted on it next to him. They took him back to the police station and ordered Ma to demonstrate the method of tearing it open. According to Ma, only the old Central Bank two-dime bills could be torn open. The other bank notes could not be torn. The detectives then gave Ma an old two-dime bill from the Central Bank. After two minutes, Ma immediately split the bill in half and was taken into custody. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Qian Xunjiu, the police station's lawyer, charged him with altering valuable bank notes under Article 195, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. When questioned, Ma confessed without hesitation that he would tear the dime bills into two, paste newspaper on one side, and use them to fool people. Judge Ye Shengchao sentenced Ma to two years and six months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Detective Team of the Ximen Sub-Bureau Arrested a Bandit Yesterday</h3>

He knew that they often robbed earth and had broken off relations with them long ago, resulting in a feud. In July of last year in the old calendar, Li Asan and others were arrested at the Yanhai Teahouse and falsely accused him of being an accomplice. He was actually wronged.

<h3>Ni Gongwei Sues for the Deposit of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway. The Bank of Communications Defends on Grounds of Subjectivity. The Court Orders a Temporary Stay Pending an Interim Ruling.</h3>
<p>During the Guangxu era of the late Qing Dynasty, the Governor-General of Sichuan petitioned for the establishment of the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company to construct the Sichuan-Hankou Railway. In the 34th year of Guangxu (1908), the company deposited 1 million taels of Kuping silver with the head office of the Bank of Communications, with an annual interest rate of 7%, payable every six months. After the success of the revolution, the railway was nationalized and incorporated into the national railway trunk line. The Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company was subsequently dissolved and reorganized into a merchant-run Sichuan Railway Company. However, due to non-compliance with legal procedures, it was not approved, registered, or recorded by the government ministries. Nevertheless, the company's name remained. Now, Ni Gongwei, the legal representative of the merchant-run Sichuan Railway Company, acting as the successor to the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company, has hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against the Bank of Communications, demanding the repayment of the deposit, totaling 1,398,741.26 yuan in national currency, plus interest. The Bank of Communications has also hired lawyers Wang Youling and Liu Chun to respond, arguing that the Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company was dissolved after nationalization, and the subject no longer exists. Ni Gongwei has filed the lawsuit in the name of the merchant-run Sichuan Railway Company. However, this company was not legally established. The Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Railways have rejected its establishment on June 9, 1915, and February 11, 1931, because it does not comply with the regulations for private railways. Therefore, after the dissolution of the former Sichuan-Hankou Railway Company, no legal successor has been established. The plaintiff's lawsuit lacks the capacity to sue. How the assets of the former Sichuan-Hankou Company should be handled has been clarified by the Ministry of Communications and should be handled through proper procedures and cannot be resolved by establishing another company. Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways has already decided to handle the funds in question separately and has issued a public notice stating that no one may use the deposit slip to mortgage or pledge to any party, domestic or foreign. Any such mortgage or pledge will be invalid. The Executive Yuan's resolution on August 16, 1934, at its 173rd meeting, decided that the funds should be used for Sichuan railway construction. The plaintiff has no right to interfere with the funds and has no standing. Ni Gongwei's lawsuit against the defendant in the capacity of legal representative of the Sichuan Railway Company does not create any legal relationship and should be dismissed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Gongdian of the First Special Court held a hearing in Civil Court 14. The Bank of Communications' lawyer raised the issue of the subject of the lawsuit, arguing that the plaintiff had no right to sue, and presented the instructions from the Executive Yuan and the two ministries of Communications and Railways as evidence. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the ministry instructions were administrative actions and could not restrict legal relationships and that the plaintiff had the right to sue. Judge Xu stated that this issue should be resolved first and ordered a temporary stay of the case pending an interim ruling.</p>
<h3>The Detective Squad of the Xin Zha Sub-Bureau Continues to Recover Abducted Girls</h3>
<p>Having Already Rescued Three Abducted Boys and Girls</p>
<p>Two Female Kidnappers Were Still Holding Two Children, a Boy and a Girl</p>
<p>Families of Missing Children Flocked to the Squad Yesterday to Identify Their Children</p>
<p>The Detective Squad of the Xin Zha Sub-Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, originally handled by Detective Xiao Huaiyu, received a tip-off at 11:30 pm on the 6th of this month that kidnappers were hiding in Lane 57 of Hanzhong Road and that the kidnappers who abducted the five-year-old boy of Huang Zhiqing, a coppersmith, were hiding in Damuqiao in the Southern District. The detective immediately reported to Deputy Squad Leader Shi Zuhan and dispatched leading detectives to break up the gang of male and female kidnappers Zhang Wenliang (Zhang Xiaosizi), Zeng Can, Zeng Ye, and Wang Li, and rescued the five-year-old boy, Huang Zhangwanzi. They also rescued a four-year-old girl from the home of Pan Feng in Lane 19, Shengsheng Li, Qiujiang Road. The boy, Zhang Wanzi, was immediately identified and taken back by his father, Huang Zhiqing. There was still a four-year-old girl, accompanied by Pan Feng, and temporarily kept at the station, as her family could not be identified. The female kidnappers, Zeng Ye and Wang Li, were still holding a boy and a girl. It was reported that the squad dispatched detectives Sun Youzhi and Zhang Shuwen, along with female kidnapper Zeng Ye and police officer Bai Guozhen of the Yongxing Road Police Station, to rescue an eleven-year-old girl, Ma Xiaohuzi, at 368 North Sichuan Road. Ma Xiaohuzi claimed that her parents were deceased, and she had an older brother and sister-in-law living at 3954 Daxu Li, Robert Road, in the Public Concession, named Ma Qinggen. The squad summoned Ma Qinggen yesterday evening, and he identified her as his sister, who had gone missing at the beginning of this month. Ma Xiaohuzi had been sold to 368 North Sichuan Road by Wang Li, introduced by Ye, for 75 yuan. The squad leaders Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan reported to the squad leaders Ji Yuanpu and Wang Huibai of the Detective Brigade. Given the recent surge in kidnapping cases in Shanghai and the frequent disappearance of boys and girls, and in consideration of the suffering of families with missing children, the case must be investigated thoroughly so that families can be reunited. It was also learned that the families of missing children flocked to the squad yesterday to identify their children from morning until dusk. Most were from the concessions and some carried small "missing person" advertisements to inquire. Some examples are as follows: Ni Fuqing of No. 15, Lane 168, Shanhai Pass Road, Public Concession, had a six-year-old girl, named Xiaomao, and a four-year-old boy, named Peiying, go missing on the 3rd of this month. Wang Demao's family at No. 116 West, intersection of Beile Road and Xujiahui Road, French Concession, also lost a seven-year-old boy, named Yinsheng, on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month. He was wearing a striped cotton robe, a black cloth jacket, an aviator cap, and running shoes. He had a small knife scar under his left eyebrow. A reward of 20 yuan or 50 yuan will be given to whoever reports or sends him back.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Telephone Company Employees to Swindle. Fortunately, Citizens Are Paying Attention.</h3>
<p>Recently, some people have been impersonating telephone company employees, falsely claiming to be repairing or using other methods to swindle money from users. There have been several such cases in recent weeks. Genuine telephone company employees must carry a license booklet with their photo, number, name, and the signature of the department head, and the date in both Chinese and English, as well as the telephone company logo. If payment is required, a temporary receipt will be issued as proof. If not, it is an impersonator. If users allow these impersonators to repair, they will not receive proper repair work from the telephone company and will definitely be fooled. It is hoped that all citizens will pay close attention to avoid being deceived.</p>

<p>Dashengfu Silk Store, Nanjing Road, Shanghai, has been established for many years, and has been well-received by customers for its high-quality goods at low prices. However, due to competition in the same industry and the decline of the market, it has suffered excessive losses. The store still has more than 500,000 yuan worth of high-quality silk, fine fur goods, woollen cloth, and embroidered lace in stock. Due to temporary financial difficulties and the pursuit of debts from various parties, it has had to close down for liquidation. With the mediation of a prominent figure in Shanghai, it has been decided to auction off the inventory within a limited time to repay the debts of the various creditors. In this time of extreme difficulty, the store has had to temporarily use the former site of the Shanghai National Goods Company opposite the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road to hold an unprecedented and shocking auction of all high-quality silk, woollen cloth, fine fur goods, and embroidered lace for the purpose of liquidating goods and raising funds, and to pay off debts. All goods are discounted by 90%. Yesterday was the first day of the auction, and customers were very crowded. People in Shanghai, aware of the high quality of the store's goods and the current low prices, have increased the number of new and old customers by more than a hundred times. Despite the extreme chaos, the auction staff are still very attentive to the customers, which is a rare sight at a store closing auction in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>20,000 Meter Long Distance Race: Li Du'an Wins Championship; Time is 74 Minutes 47.4 Seconds; Wang Zhenglin Performs Excellently, Breaking Previous Record</h3>
<p>The 4th 20,000-meter long-distance race organized by the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education started at 9:00 am yesterday in front of the Mudan University in Jiangwan. A total of 155 people participated, with 11 temporary absences. A total of 119 people reached the finish line, and 5 people participated in the performance. Except for Zhang Liang, who was absent due to other matters, the "Four Heavenly Kings" such as Wang, Wu, Ling, and Niu all performed on the field. As a result, the championship in the open group was won by the up-and-coming young general Li Du'an, with a time of 74 minutes, 47 and two-fifths seconds. The runner-up was Ma Riji, and the third place was Wang Rulin. The top three in the performance group were monopolized by the Yousheng Cross-Country Team. Wang Zhenglin also won first place with an excellent score of 73 minutes and 58 and two-fifths seconds, breaking the previous record of 74 minutes and 8 and one-fifth seconds held by He Doushan. The second and third places were Wu Yuanlin and Ling Xuewen, only 18 feet behind Wang. Niu Hongquan was unlucky and finished behind the two young generals Li and Ma. Finally, the award ceremony was held in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium, bringing a successful conclusion to a grand cross-country race. The details of yesterday's race are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Du'an takes the lead. At 8:30 am, all the athletes lined up at the starting point, ready to go. At 9:00 am sharp, the starter fired a shot, and all 288 swift-footed athletes scrambled to be the first, running like flying. The young general Li Du'an immediately stood out from the crowd and took the lead all the way. Ma Riji followed closely behind. Qian Zenglong, Song Bin, and Gu Huiyuan squeezed together. Niu Hongquan and Wang Rulin advanced side by side. Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, and Ling Xuewen were confident, so they started the slowest. After running Xiangyin Road, they turned into Kongjiang Road and entered the cinder road avenue. Fine sand flew everywhere as the wind rose, and the soldiers complained endlessly. The two young heroes from the Xu family, Li and Ma, were calm and advanced side by side. Wan Jinsheng, Wu Xuecheng, and Qian Zenglong followed closely. Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, and Ling Xuewen caught up within the top ten, but they were still 200 meters away from Li Du'an.</p>
<p>Wang, Wu, and Ling are inseparable. On the Ma Yushan Road, the general situation did not change much. After passing Guanyintang Road to the front of the Far East Racecourse, Li and Ma were ambitious and accelerated their advance. Wan Jinsheng fell behind by 100 meters. Wang, Wu, and Ling were inseparable, surpassing each other one after another. Wu Xuecheng, Qian Zenglong, Gu Huiyuan, Yang Linfa, and Guan Youwen followed closely. Niu Hongquan also caught up to 80 meters behind the twelfth place, followed by generals such as Pan Gongshi and Tang Xianlin Chen Zhiming.</p>
<p>Wu Wenlin suddenly rises. Turning left from Guanyintang Road into Jungong Road, the Huangpu River was vaguely visible. The road was quiet and elegant. Wan Jinsheng was panting and gradually fell behind. Seeing an opportunity, Wang, Wu, and Ling immediately accelerated their pace and went their separate ways. After running the long Jungong Road, the journey was already halfway over. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant in Zha Yin Road was already in sight. Wang Zhenglin led the two generals Wu and Ling, approaching Li and Ma with a grand momentum, only 50 meters away. Wan Jinsheng was 300 meters behind. Niu Hongquan caught up. Yang Linfa and Gu Huiyuan were chatting and laughing. When passing the Water and Electricity Plant for 1,000 meters, Wu Wenlin suddenly rose up, coming on fiercely, chasing past the two generals Li and Ma. Wang Zhenglin and Ling Xuewen tracked closely behind.</p>
<p>Wang Zhenglin reports first. On Minqing Road and Shiguang Road, the competition between generals Wu and Wang was fierce, forcing Li and Ma to cross over again. Wu Wenlin and Wang Zhenglin showed their prowess and took the lead. They reached the front of the security guard at the West Gate. The distance was too far, causing the athletes to stray onto a fork in the road. By the time they realized it, they had already run 20 or 30 meters. After crossing the Shuimenting Bridge, Wang Zhenglin, Wu Wenlin, and Ling Xuewen all surpassed Li and Ma on Songhu Road. They turned left into Guohe Road. Wang, Wu, and Ling ran faster and faster. Li Du'an and Ma Riji seemed powerless, falling behind by 200 meters. When they were about 500 meters away from the finish line, Wang Zhenglin became more and more excited, with a graceful posture and a calm attitude. He was the first to report and reached the finish line with a time of 73 minutes and 58 and one-fifth seconds, breaking the record. 20 meters behind was Wu Wenlin, a famous long-distance runner from Hebei, and Ling Xuewen also followed closely. 300 meters further behind was Li Du'an, the champion of the open group, with a time of 74 minutes, 47 and two-fifths seconds. Ma Riji was 200 meters behind, and it took a minute before Niu Hongquan, a famous long-distance runner from Shandong, arrived slowly. After that came Wang Rulin, Wan Jinsheng, Yang Linfa, Gu Huiyuan, and the ranking is as follows: Wang Zhenglin (performance group, time 73 minutes 58 and one-fifth seconds), Wu Wenlin (performance group), Ling Xuewen (performance group), Li Du'an (open group champion), Ma Riji, Niu Hongquan (performance group), Wang Rulin, Zhou Ruquan, Wan Jinsheng, Gu Huiyuan, Yang Linqing, Qian Zenglong, Song Bin, Xu Yaoming, Guan Youwen, Pan Gongbao, Tang Xianlin, Chen Zhiming, Wu Xuecheng, Xu Longgen, Jin Zhaosheng, Zhang Jinfa, Pei Qi, Yang Weixin, Le Kangnian, Lin Xingshui, Chen Guanghua, Lu Mei, Bao Chunlin.</p>

<h3>Six Wins in Six Games: Youyou Defeats Shakor; Result is Two to One; Shakor's Performance is Not Bad</h3>
<p>In the Western League First Division Football League, Youyou and Shakor met at Yiyuan yesterday afternoon at 3:45 pm. Youyou has been undefeated in five games since its debut, with results no less than those of the French Concession team. Shakor, on the other hand, has lost eight and drawn one in nine games, currently ranked last. In yesterday's game, it was widely expected that Shakor would be vulnerable to Youyou's attack. Surprisingly, after the start of the game, Shakor fought vigorously, with sharp forwards and solid defenders, actually competing with Youyou. Youyou's players were average, and although the forwards were not weak, their cooperation was not perfect. Neither side scored in the first half. In the second half, Shakor had a penalty kick opportunity and opened the scoring. Youyou worked hard to counterattack, with Liang Shutang scoring two long-range shots, resulting in a 2-1 victory. There were 300 spectators, and the scene was not lonely. The lineups of both sides are as follows: Youyou: Zhang Rongcai, Chen Zhenxiang, Jiang Shanjing, Yun Yi, Xu Jingcheng, Liang Shutang, Wang Nanzhen, Xi Qiaosheng, Chen Zhenhe, Liu Shizan, Zhong Yongsen. Shakor: Bao Weiqu, Sailuoke, Ge Bituofu, Yiersheng, Gu Fulov, Mai Nuoski, Bo Lining, Siyeyefu, Aibigefu, Mi Tailuofu, Xiesijin. Referee: Ma Lisi. At the sound of the silver whistle, both sides began to engage. Little Black Coal led the three armies straight to the enemy camp. Zhong Yongsen took a long-range shot, which was gently palmed out by Bao Weiqu and passed to the front. Fulov coordinated in the middle, and Xiesijin invaded from the periphery. Ronoski shot as soon as he got the ball. Zhang Rongcai calmly held the ball and passed it far to Xi Qiaosheng, then to Little Black Coal, and then to Wang Nanzhen. Wang raised his foot for a shot, but it went slightly wide. The enemy army peered in, and Chen Zhenxiang lost his footing twice, with Eniyev and Xiesijin knocking on the door one after another. Rongcai saved the danger by diving and parrying. After that, they advanced and retreated repeatedly, and the stalemate persisted. Then, Liu Shizan, with the help of Black Coal, dribbled past two defenders and shot with all his strength, but it was still unsuccessful. The enemy army tilted its troops forward, and Chen Zhenxiang defended too hastily, violating the rules and being penalized with a penalty kick. Eniyev, the left inside forward, took the kick, and the ball flew like an arrow, straight into the corner of the goal. Zhang Rongcai dived and palmed it out, earning thunderous applause. Not long after, the first half ended, with no goals scored by either side. Changing sides to fight again, Youyou changed its formation, with Liu Shidu changing to center forward and Little Black Coal and Xi Qiaosheng taking the positions of left and right inside forwards respectively, joining forces to attack. Xu Jingcheng transported the ball to the front, Xi Qiaosheng received the ball and gently lobbed it to the middle. Little Black Coal greeted it with his head, and Bao Weiqu jumped to catch it. Then, Shakor came to attack again, and Bo Lining scored with one kick. Zhenxiang and Jingcheng each headed one, and the ball reached the center line. Chen Zhenhe dribbled to the left side and sent it to the middle. Jingcheng fired a long shot, but it was slightly higher than the crossbar. Not long after, Little Coal was sent off, and Youyou fought with ten men. Shakor took advantage of the situation to attack fiercely, and Zhenxiang rushed to save the ball, but inadvertently fouled and was again penalized with a penalty kick, which was scored by Ge Bituofu. The Youyou team then lost the goal. After this setback, the generals of Youyou gritted their teeth and vowed to avenge this shame. Liang Shutang took over as center forward, issuing orders. Zhong Yongsen started a rebellion on the right flank, Wang Nanzhen responded on the left, and Xi Qiaosheng rose up in the Central Plains, frightening the enemy army. Yongsen found an opportunity to pass the ball, and the shot was accurate and urgent, but it was blocked by the enemy goalkeeper. Then, Liang Shutang took a long-range shot from 30 yards, and Bao Weiqu was now unprepared. The ball flew straight into the net. After Youyou gained the advantage, their courage was multiplied. The enemy general fouled, and Xu Jingcheng took the penalty kick, passing it to Liang Shutang. Liang jumped up for a header, but it missed. Then, Qiaosheng passed to Liang Shutang again, and he raised his foot for a long-range shot, which Bao Weiqu held. Liu Shidu was like quicksilver, dribbling past Bao and kicking the ball into the net. Youyou then won the second goal. After that, the enemy army tilted its troops to counterattack, but fortunately Jiang Shanjing guarded well and did not lose an inch of ground. Before long, time ran out, and Youyou triumphed with a score of 2-1.</p>

After the start of the game, Tung Wah's forwards were unusually fierce, appearing and disappearing in the enemy's formation from time to time. Lux's defense was strict, but Tung Wah's Feng Nian'ao received a pass from Chen Dehui and scored a goal, opening the scoring. Cao Qinfang was also unwilling to lag behind, constantly threatening the enemy and taking the opportunity to score. The first half ended with Tung Wah leading 2-0. In the second half, they engaged in a fierce battle again. The generals of Lux were already exhausted from fighting and unable to fight. The defense was lax, and Tung Wah launched a major offensive. The iron hooves of the three knights, Chen Dehui, Cao Qinfang, and Qian Jingyong, ravaged the enemy's formation from time to time. Qian Jingyong scored a goal in the chaos, and Chen Dehui added the finishing touch. After that, there were no more achievements. When the trumpet sounded, both sides withdrew, with Tung Wah winning.

<h3>The City Temporarily Postpones the Compilation of the Teaching Progress Schedule for All Subjects in Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Last autumn, Director Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, in view of the uneven level and inconsistent curriculum of middle schools in the city, decided to improve the level by unifying the teaching progress of all subjects. He invited 39 experts to form a committee to compile the teaching progress schedule for all subjects in middle schools, with Director Pan serving as chairman and Chen Duanzhi, the principal of Xinya Middle School, serving as secretary. Since the first drafts of each subject were almost completed, a joint meeting of the heads of each group was held to discuss the date of compiling the drafts. After discussion, it was decided that the educational goals in the extraordinary period might differ from the original curriculum standards. Therefore, the committee requested instructions from Chairman Pan, asking whether to continue compiling according to the original goals or to postpone the process. The Education Bureau has now approved the postponement of the progress schedule. However, all initial drafts must still be preserved. After receiving the approval, the secretary, Chen Duanzhi, has sent letters to the directors of each subject committee to inform them of the decision.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Raochang</p>
<p>After everyone exchanged greetings, Mrs. Shu said, "The program must begin, or the actors will fall asleep." So everyone went to the classroom, and each sat in place in front of a curtain made of two large sheets. The children were nowhere to be seen, but the suppressed laughter and strange little cries behind the curtain had already revealed their whereabouts. The opening performance of the entertainment was a display of gymnastics, which was very energetic. Six of the older children, wearing blue pants and red shirts, led by Fulang, used dumbbells, sticks, etc., showing a lot of strength. All the movements were in accordance with the rhythm of the piano, and the music was provided by Mrs. Shan Shu from behind the curtain. Donn did so diligently that he almost knocked down the people on his left and right, or whistled the beanbag through the seats of the audience, because he saw Mr. Ha's arrival and was so excited that he burned with a strong desire to fully show the achievements of his teacher.</p>
<p>"A strong, good boy. If I were to go to South America in the next year or two, I would be greedy to ask you to lend him to me for a while, Mr. Pei," Mr. Ha said, his interest in Donn now further increased because he heard Mr. Pei's report on him.</p>
<p>"You can ask him to go, and you are welcome to do so, but we will naturally feel sad when we lose our young warrior. This will be of great benefit to him, and I dare say he will be loyal to his friends."</p>

<h3>A Review of the Gradual Prosperity of World Trade</h3>
<p>— Wang Nai-geng</p>
<p>And Our Country's Future Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Signs of Improvement in World Trade</p>
<p>For the past two or three years, the domestic economies of various countries have been unable to recover for the time being, resulting in the continued contraction of world trade. However, in the third and fourth quarters of last year (1935), the trend of world trade has gradually shown signs of recovery and improvement. According to a survey by the German Imperial Statistical Office (calculating foreign trade of 52 countries converted into Marks), the total value of world trade in the third and fourth quarters of last year was 21.7 billion Marks, an increase of 300 million Marks compared to the same period of the previous year, a percentage increase of 1.9%. According to a survey by the League of Nations (calculating foreign trade of 76 countries converted into Francs), there was also a percentage increase of 2.4%. The surveys of the Imperial Statistical Office and the League of Nations are listed below:</p>
<p>World Trade Value Index (Base year 1929)</p>
<p>Previous Year 　Franc Index　Mark Index</p>
<p>First Quarter　34.0　33.5</p>
<p>Second Quarter　33.5　33.9</p>
<p>Third Quarter　33.9　33.3</p>
<p>Fourth Quarter　35.9　35.0</p>
<p>Last Year (1935)</p>
<p>First Quarter　33.1　32.3</p>
<p>Second Quarter　33.4　32.2</p>
<p>Third Quarter　33.7　32.7</p>
<p>According to the new index of the German Business Cycle Research Institute (based on a survey of 35 countries accounting for more than 90% of total world trade), this phenomenon of improved trade shows a similar increase of 6.3%. Viewing the new index with 1929 as the base year, world trade has recovered from 42.4 in the third quarter of 1932 to 52.2 in the third quarter of 1935, a recovery of 23.1%. However, compared to the level of 1929, it is still only 47.9%, and the overall recovery is still a long way off.</p>
<p>New Posture in the Trade Development of Industrialized Nations</p>
<p>The trend of improved world trade in the third quarter of last year showed slightly different development tendencies when categorized by industrialized and agricultural nations. Let us first observe the industrialized nations from both European and non-European perspectives to see how foreign trade is developing.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1935, almost all the industrialized countries in Europe showed a general trend of increase. For example, the United Kingdom, the Scandinavian countries, Austria, and Czechoslovakia all showed considerable signs of improvement in their foreign trade. On the other hand, the trade of the Gold Bloc countries (France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Belgium until March 1935) showed a slight decline due to the continued deterioration of their domestic economic conditions, and the increasing difficulties in foreign exchange in Italy and Germany. However, from a general perspective, the foreign trade of European industrialized countries seems to be generally increasing.</p>
<p>Since the second quarter of last year, there have been several significant changes in the industrialized countries of Europe. First, Belgium ended its parity. After the parity ended at the end of March, the country's foreign trade increased significantly. For example, comparing the total value of Belgian imports and exports with the same period last year, the first quarter decreased by 9.3%, the second quarter increased by 22.8%, and the third quarter increased by 32.8%. Second, Germany's foreign trade had been in a state of constant import surplus since 1934, but since May 1935, it turned into a result of increased exports and reduced imports. Its export surplus has gradually increased since the third quarter. Finally, as a result of the dispute with Abyssinia, Italy's trade, especially the import of military supplies, increased significantly. Another example is the trade between the United States and Italy. The trade in the ten months since January 1935 was 55 million gold dollars, an increase of 8.3% compared to the same period last year. Not only that, but the changes in exports to Italy's colonies in South Africa are even more alarming. During the same period, it increased from 254,000 gold dollars to more than 3,597,000 dollars, a surge of more than 16 times. In October alone, oil exports to Italy increased from 340,000 in October 1934 to 1.7 million, copper exports increased from 190,000 to 550,000, and aircraft soared from 4,000 to 200,000 gold dollars.</p>
<p>Based on the changes above, the foreign trade of European industrialized countries, except for the continued contraction of the trade of the Gold Bloc countries, has generally increased since the third quarter. A table is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Secondly, the foreign trade of industrialized countries outside Europe is also developing in the same way. Japan's foreign trade has been rising continuously in the past four years, and it was particularly significant last year, which needs no further explanation. The United States' foreign trade, because it inherited the extreme increase in exports in 1933 and 1934, turned to an increase in imports in 1935, resulting in its original export surplus in the eleven months since January changing from 439 million dollars in 1934 to a sharp decrease to 197 million gold dollars in 1935. The reason for the increase in US imports is that domestic droughts caused a reduction in agricultural harvests, and the increase in raw material imports was due to the recovery of the economy in recent years and the increased needs of domestic industries. Even the increase in imports of manufactured goods is unavoidable, especially due to the recovery of the domestic economy mentioned above, which is a major factor. The conclusion of new trade treaties between Belgium, Sweden, and other countries is an example.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade Trends of Agricultural Nations</p>
<p>The foreign trade of agricultural nations can also be observed separately in Europe and outside of Europe, just like industrialized nations.</p>
<p>Among the European agricultural countries, except for Denmark, which has been consistently sluggish, other countries such as England, Spain, Poland, and the Balkan countries have seen cumulative increases in imports in 1933 and 1934, while exports have continued to decline. As a result, the import surplus has increased, so the financial systems of these countries have also been in a state of deterioration, and the difficulties in their debt are a matter of course. However, since 1935, the situation has changed. Among them, countries such as the Balkan countries and Ireland have achieved good results with increased exports and reduced imports, and their foreign trade has obviously shown signs of improvement. Hungary and other countries have also formed a trade surplus due to the increased demand from Italy, resulting in increased exports. Therefore, Europe's foreign trade has recovered considerably since 1935.</p>
<p>The foreign trade of agricultural countries outside of Europe, such as China, the Dutch East Indies, and French colonies, still had a tendency to develop last year. The improvement of this trade situation is primarily due to the gradual recovery of the economies of industrialized countries and the resulting increase in demand for raw materials. As a result, the trade of these agricultural countries has gradually seen a surplus, and their debt situation has been improved accordingly. A portion of foreign exchange has thus increased. However, the international settlement capacity of agricultural countries has also increased considerably as a result, often leading to a cycle of large-scale imports. Recently, the trade phenomenon in various countries is that although exports have increased, the increase in imports is even greater at the same time. This trend in trade may worsen. On the other hand, the export of manufactured goods from industrialized countries such as England, the United States, and Japan is active. However, if these agricultural countries see a trend of deterioration in their trade situation, they will inevitably consider ways to reduce their imports sooner or later. This is indeed an obstacle to the development of world trade and is quite worrying. If one studies the future trend of agricultural products and raw materials, which will inevitably become more expensive, then the trade of these agricultural countries</p>
<p>Greatly Has Been on the Road to Recovery</p>
<p>From the above explanation, it is clear that the improvement in world trade is largely based on the recovery of industrialized countries' economies and the activity of raw material markets. Especially considering the recent good situation of raw material producing countries, it does not seem to be an excessive delusion to expect improvements in world trade. It is a fact that agricultural countries' exports have increased, and the purchasing power of agricultural regions for manufactured goods has also increased. Moreover, since the new trade policy formulated by the US government in 1934 is sufficient to ease trade barriers with special countries and the increase of treaty countries, it will give world trade</p>
<p>At a time when world trade is improving, the recent issue of sanctions against Italy by the League of Nations has caused concern that such sanctions would affect world trade. In fact, this observation is too much of a concern, as Italy accounts for only 3% of world trade. In addition, the extent of these sanctions and how effective they will be is questionable. It is reported that Sorini stated at the cabinet meeting on December 30 last year: "Recently, the Italian government has concluded financial agreements with the governments of Austria, Hungary, Switzerland, and Germany." So, the effect of the League's sanctions against Italy remains to be seen! In short, regardless of the means of sanctions, world trade is undoubtedly entering a new path of development.</p>
<p>Our Country's Future Foreign Trade</p>
<p>In the above article, our country is classified as an agricultural country. Although there is nothing wrong with this at first glance in our country, which has always called itself an "agricultural nation," a closer look at the facts of our foreign trade reveals that our claim to be an agricultural country is quite shameful! The difference between agricultural and industrialized countries is often expressed in the type of commodities that make up their export and import surpluses. In the usual trade pattern, agricultural countries generally have a large export surplus of food and raw materials, and a large import surplus of manufactured goods; industrialized countries generally have a large import surplus of food and raw materials, and manufactured goods are usually a large export surplus. However, the situation in our country is very different. For example, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, the import of manufactured goods in our country accounted for 49%, and the import surplus was 301,346,000 yuan. At the same time, the import of raw materials and semi-finished products also accounted for 26%, with an import surplus of 95,532,000 yuan, and the import of food also accounted for 21%, with an import surplus of 65,708,000 yuan. From this, it can be seen that our so-called agricultural country not only relies on foreign countries for manufactured goods, but also still relies on foreign countries for agricultural products, which is very different from the normal state of an agricultural country. For grain alone, our country's self-sufficiency deficit reaches 14% of production. Since the 10th year of the Republic of China, the average annual import of foreign rice has been more than 16.6 million hectoliters. Last year, after the severe drought of the previous year, although the harvests of each province varied, from the overall perspective, it was a year of relatively good harvests, but the import of foreign rice was still as high as more than 12.9 million hectoliters, ranking first among imported goods! An increase of 52% compared to the previous year. Even in a good year, it is still like this, so it is not only a major problem for the country, but also, in the event of a national crisis, the source of foreign rice would be cut off. The outcome would be decided before the battle, and it would be enough to control our lives. The significance of this is not only a question of import and export surpluses, but also a question of people's food and national defense. According to a recent survey by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, there are more than 20 million mu of wasteland in the country. From the point of view of making the most of the land, this has not been completely resolved.</p>
<p>Therefore, when discussing the import and export surpluses of trade, we should base our joy and sorrow on the nature of the commodities and whether the trade is developing in a balanced way. I believe that although an import surplus is worrying, if most of the imports are machinery, materials, and other direct or indirect means of production, then it is a beneficial import surplus because it helps the development of domestic production. On the other hand, although an export surplus is a welcome phenomenon, if the export surplus is an abnormal development, it is still an unhealthy export situation. For example, our country claims to be an agricultural nation, but it has a huge export of manufactured goods. If this export is truly caused by the development of domestic industry, it is indeed worthy of joy, but unfortunately, this is not the case in reality. For example, in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, manufactured goods accounted for the largest share of our country's exported goods, accounting for 39%, but the export of cotton yarn and cotton cloth from Japanese-owned yarn factories in China accounted for more than 70% of this. For example, our country's exported goods have traditionally been dominated by silk and tea, but recently, they have changed to tung oil, sesame, and other agricultural by-products that are easily imitated and do not have exclusivity. Also, if the level of import and export trade is an export surplus that tends to decline, it is an unhealthy export situation. (For example, in January of this year, Shanghai's exports were more than 37 million yuan, and imports were more than 35 million yuan, which were both less than the monthly import surplus level of 40 million yuan during the peak period; another example is that the import surplus in the 22nd year of the Republic of China was more than 733.3 million yuan, but it decreased to more than 494.4 million yuan in the previous year, and further decreased to more than 343.3 million yuan last year. The level of import surplus in recent years has all tended to decline.)</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that our country's future foreign trade should take the following measures: Strive for agricultural self-sufficiency, especially in rice, wheat, and cotton. Improve special products such as silk, tea, and tung oil to seek the expansion of overseas markets. The products of general industry and commerce should first aim to seize the sales of foreign goods in the domestic market, and then gradually seek overseas outlets based on market needs. It is obviously much easier to promote the sales of domestic goods in our country and for our people to use domestic goods than to promote the sales of domestic goods in foreign countries and for foreigners to use domestic goods. Given our country's current international position and the decline of domestic industry and commerce, it is a laborious and less profitable endeavor to expand the export of domestic goods. Although the total value of our country's foreign trade has been declining year by year, the amount of imported goods and the import surplus are still very large, indicating that the domestic sales force is still strong. From the point of view of goods flowing smoothly and things being used to their full potential, this has not been completely achieved.</p>
<p>Although the national trade surplus in December of last year was more than 5 million yuan, and the export surplus in January of this year was more than 9.7 million yuan, although the amount is small, for our country, which has been in an import surplus position for many years, the continued discovery of this kind of transformation in trade patterns, whether due to the impact of the new monetary policy or the weakness of national purchasing power, is still a noteworthy or even exciting industrial situation.</p>
<h3>An Exploration of the Reasons for China's Trade Surplus</h3>
<p>— Mo Yan</p>
<p>The Good and Bad of a Trade Surplus</p>
<p>In the two months following the currency reform, specifically December of last year and January of this year, China's trade history unexpectedly recorded a new surplus record unseen in sixty years. According to reports from the Maritime Customs, the surplus for December was five million yuan, with total exports amounting to 70,575,728 yuan, an increase compared to both November of last year and the previous year. Imports, on the other hand, decreased compared to both the previous month and the same period last year. Although the surplus amount for January slightly decreased, it still reached as much as 1.39 million yuan. This fact cannot be said to be anything other than a rare occurrence since the establishment of customs.</p>
<p>The reasons for this trade surplus are certainly worthy of study. At the same time, it's also worth noting what economic effects the surplus has on our nation, specifically whether it has more positive or negative effects.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it seems that a trade surplus would balance international payments. Also, increased exports would lead to industrial development, thereby boosting the national economy. Furthermore, after the currency reform, many people believed that, due to the devaluation of China's currency, Chinese goods would only be hoarded overseas, and therefore economic growth could be expected daily. It seems that the current trade surplus aligns with this prediction. However, the reality is not so simple. Analyzing the exported goods, it becomes apparent that the exports of these two months mainly consist of agricultural products such as tung oil, cotton, silk, and tea, while the imported goods are mainly minerals, metals, paper, and kerosene. This indicates that there has been no turnaround in China's national industry. Moreover, the extent of benefits that agricultural exports bring to farmers is also questionable. The most obvious negative impact is the significant reduction in customs revenue, which is of paramount importance. We will first discuss the reasons for the trade surplus and then talk about the various effects after the surplus.</p>
<p>Reasons for the Trade Surplus</p>
<p>The trade surplus in China in the recent two months is caused by the increase in exports and the absolute decrease in imports. Therefore, to study the reasons for this surplus, we must discuss the import and export aspects separately.</p>
<p>First, Imports:——</p>
<p>According to the statistics of customs imports and exports, there is no doubt that the trade volume imported into China in recent years is decreasing year by year, and the decrease in import volume last year and the year before is even more obvious. The following table shows the decrease in our import trade since 1931 (unit: thousands of yuan):</p>
<p>Year (Republic of China)　Import Volume　Index</p>
<p>1931　2,233,376　100.0</p>
<p>1932　1,634,726　73.2</p>
<p>1933　1,346,067　60.3</p>
<p>1934　1,229,665　46.1</p>
<p>1935　919,210　41.2</p>
<p>From the table above, it can be seen that after the economic panic in China in 1932, the volume of import trade has decreased sharply. The reduction in import trade in 1934 and 1935 continued to be significant. In 1934, the total national import volume was 1,002,960,524 yuan, but last year it decreased by about 519,210,000 yuan, with a total decrease of 110,459,000 yuan, or about 15.6%. In recent months, the decrease in the number has been as mentioned above, indicating that this reduction is not purely due to the currency reform, but a consistent trend since the economic panic in China. Therefore, one of the biggest reasons for the decrease in the import volume of foreign trade must be said to be the absolute and relative decrease in the purchasing power of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Proof of the decrease in the purchasing power of the Chinese people can also be obtained from the nature of imported goods. We know that the most important position in imported goods in December last year and January this year is occupied by metals and minerals. It should be known that metals and minerals are rarely used in industry and quite often used in military supplies. The increase in military supplies is certain, and of course everyone knows that it has nothing to do with the national economy.</p>
<p>Another indirect proof lies in the fact that the import volume of rice accounts for a large proportion of imported goods. The total import volume in December last year was 2,957,330 Customs Gold Units (one Customs Gold Unit is equivalent to 2.268 National Currency), while rice alone accounted for 407,196 Customs Gold Units, or about 13.7%. So much rice is imported, which first indicates the bankruptcy of the Chinese countryside, so production is insufficient and rice must be purchased from abroad to supplement it. Second, rice is a necessity of life, so the increase in rice imports can only indicate the decline of the Chinese rural economy, and is not enough to indicate an increase in people's purchasing power.</p>
<p>Secondly, another important reason for the decrease in the population is that before and after the currency reform in China, Japanese cotton mills in China greatly expanded, so the import of yarn and cloth decreased. We don't know exactly how much Japanese-owned cotton and textile mills in China have expanded. However, according to recent news reports, it is a fact that Japanese factories in Shanghai are mostly switching to spinning fine yarn and expanding production. Therefore, the reduction of cotton yarn and cloth, which has always occupied an important part of imports, is very likely. From this, we can know that the reduction in textile imports does not necessarily mean that our country's light industry has the possibility of development. The expansion of Japanese yarn mills in China can avoid the burden of tariffs, which will only deepen the oppression of China's textile industry.</p>
<p>Second, Exports:——</p>
<p>An important reason for the increase in exports, which made the national trade balance favorable, is related to the recent sale of a large amount of silver to the United States. According to news in various newspapers, about 60 million silver coins were sold by sellers of Chinese silver in the New York market. Everyone knows the relationship between silver sales and the national economy, so there is no need to say more.</p>
<p>Secondly, among the exports in these two months, the most important position in December was cotton and tung oil, and tung oil in January. Sesame, hemp, silk, etc. The cotton yarn item, which is an important industrial product of our country, is only more than 1.3 million yuan, which shows that the export of raw materials is still an absolute majority, and the export of industrial products is really insignificant. If this situation is compared with the fact that most imported goods are manufactured products, the colonial nature of China's economy is obvious. At the same time, the reason for the increase in tung oil exports is undoubtedly related to the arms race among various countries. Because tung oil is most widely used in warships and military equipment, our country's trade surplus is related to the military fever of various countries. This is also the reason for the increase in exports.</p>
<p>Again, what many people value is how China's currency reform affects exports? It should also be discussed. Generally, scholars tend to believe that after the currency reform in the country stipulates the value of the currency, foreign trade can increase because the value of our country's currency is fixed. At the same time, in foreign markets, because our country's goods can be sold at relatively low prices, sales will inevitably increase. The former reason still has some validity under certain conditions, but the first reason is more problematic. Because our country is a sub-colonial country, we are not allowed to have room for hoarding in the markets of the great powers, and China's raw materials are fundamentally determined by the needs of the suzerain states, and we are definitely not as competitive as we are in the colonial market. The facts are also like this. The most important exports in these two months were cotton and tung oil. The most important markets for cotton are Japan and Germany. This is because that country's own cotton production is fundamentally insufficient, and it needs to import cotton from China every year, which is not a temporary situation. As for tung oil, more than 80% is imported to the United States, also because the United States does not produce tung oil, and the situation has always been the same. It can be said that it has nothing to do with the currency reform. This alone is enough to show that it is not an advantage gained from competition. As for the most competitive commodities such as silk and tea (the main competitor is Japan), the export situation is different. The export volume of tea in these two months is not very high. It was 1,935,037 yuan in December and 1,588,536 yuan in January. The ratio of tea exports does not seem to have increased. As for silk exports, there was a phenomenon of activity before the currency reform, but after the currency reform, it was not particularly increased, but only retreated to the third place in exports. Moreover, the export volume in January was only 3,189,347 yuan, which was less than the 5,856,086 yuan in December.</p>
<p>These points are enough to prove that many people's hopes are not in line with the actual situation. It's just a fantasy!</p>
<p>What Impact on the Chinese Economy?</p>
<p>From the above analysis, it can be seen that the reason for the surplus is very accidental, and the most important point is that the domestic market is shrinking sharply, so it is relatively presented as a surplus. At the same time, many scholars unanimously believe that trade will soon have a surplus after the currency reform, and that after the surplus, the revitalization of industry can be expected soon. According to the facts, it is not necessarily the truth.</p>
<p>Why is this? First, the trade surplus directly leads to a significant reduction in customs revenue, because the main source of customs revenue is imported goods, and the bulk of the expenditure is used for various purposes such as domestic and foreign debt funds and reparations. Everyone knows that public debt investment is an important part of our country's banks and banknote funds. If credit is shaken, how serious will its impact on the entire financial credit be? Since last year, due to the shortage of customs revenue, the monthly deficit has been 4 million yuan, which clearly shows the contradiction between China's financial foundation and the national economy. Because according to common practice, a surplus seems to be an increase in domestic production, but the situation in our country is very special. The surplus not only says that there is a possibility of revitalizing industry, but also that finance has become a problem.</p>
<p>Secondly, how does the trade surplus affect national industry? In fact, it is not as beneficial as we hoped. Because the exported products are cheap raw materials, while the imported products are finished products. This means that others take our cheap raw materials and make them into expensive finished products and then sell them in the Chinese market. How much will we lose in one hand? Everyone understands this. Moreover, the situation may be even worse due to the surplus.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the exports are mainly agricultural products, so it seems to be beneficial to our country's rural areas. Relatively speaking, there may be some benefits to be said, but we must pay attention to the fact that China's export trade is exported overseas through exporters and compradores. Can the price of farmers' products be raised due to more exports? This is unreliable. It is proved that in the past, those who benefited from higher prices were often middlemen, etc. This situation is obviously still the same. It is inevitable to raise prices and form an unequal exchange, which will promote the decline of the Chinese countryside.</p>
<p>From the above points of view, there is no need to be complacent about the sudden trade surplus in our country. The change in the national economy has almost nothing to do with it. Therefore, we must not rashly conclude that the trade surplus is a symbol of China's economic recovery.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the reasons mentioned above, this two-month surplus may still be reversed in the future. This is because the export of Chinese agricultural products is entirely determined by how the economies of the great powers develop. In the current chronic deterioration of the world economic panic, there is no hope of expanding exports except for commodities related to military supplies. Moreover, international competition for many commodities such as tea, silk, yarn, cotton, and wheat is already very fierce, and the tariff barriers and competitive power of the great powers are also enough to overwhelm China. China's silk and tea exports have been decreasing year by year, which is obviously due to Japan's exclusion. It is questionable whether exports can be increased now.</p>
<p>Secondly, Tianjin Customs has always been one of the important ports for export. In North China, the power of a certain country is increasing day by day, and it is using various means to make its commodity imports increase sharply. It is bound to have a great impact on China's average trade. This is also a very serious problem in trade at present.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter from which aspect, this trade surplus is not enough to be optimistic about the future of our country's economic development. On the contrary, it is a manifestation of the process of China's economic panic and the increasing colonialization.</p>

<h3>Finance: Interbank Loan Interest Rate Remains Unchanged, Silver Dollar Recedes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market remained stable. The interbank loan interest rate did not change, staying at eight percent in both the morning and afternoon, the same as the previous day. In the interbank bill market, over 3.4 million was transferred in the morning, with over 500,000 in new transactions, and over 200,000 in afternoon transactions. Money shops cleared over 36 million in silver dollar public orders, and over 600,000 in remittances from various regions. The subsidiary currency market saw little activity, with only 35,000 jiao of small Guangdong silver dollars traded in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Its black market price retreated slightly by 0.02 from the previous day, to 12.08. Copper coins remained at 305,000 wen, with 25,010 units traded, amounting to 8,200 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Securities: Investment is Cautious, Bond Market Trading is Slow... Market is Stagnant</h3>
<p>From March 2nd to 7th last week, the market situation of the Chinese Securities Exchange tended to stabilize. Market prices were seen to hover, and trading also decreased accordingly. The stagnation of market prices was common in the past, but at that time, the total amount in circulation was only half of the current amount in circulation. The current minimum transaction volume is less than 2 million, which is vastly different from the past maximum of 40 to 50 million. In the past, the amount was small but there were many transactions, while now the amount is large but there are few transactions. The reason is nothing more than suspicion. Those who want to go long suspect that the outflow of spot goods cannot be contained, and the amount is much larger than in the past. Those who want to go short suspect that the Equalization Committee's suppression will not be profitable. Therefore, they are in a dilemma, which makes speculators wait and see. Investors are afraid that the amount is too large and easy to fall, so they tend to trade in a sluggish market under natural conditions. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon, because about half of the 146 million yuan in unified public bonds are in the hands of retail investors, and they are bound to surge out. To prevent this dangerous surge, it was the original intention of the equipment Equalization Committee. Judging from this, the future of market prices may be low first and then high, and transactions can only be prosperous if they are accurate. Last week, on Monday, there was a rumor that the issuance of circulating coupons would recover gold, and those who wanted to go long raised prices at the same time. Numbers 43 and 52 were purchased quite a bit, and each bond rose by more than 1.5 yuan to 3.3 yuan. Number 96 gradually turned down. The rumor subsided. On Tuesday, there was a slight outflow of spot goods, and numbers 6, 16, 20, 34, 35, etc. were all sold, falling by a few cents to 1.56 yuan. After this rise and fall, market prices gradually stabilized, and transactions gradually decreased. On Wednesday, it started well at about 0.5 yuan. On Thursday, it fell back by about 0.5 yuan. On Friday and Saturday, trading was the slowest, and only number 73 was purchased slightly, but it was already satisfied. Market prices all rose back by 0.3 or 0.4 yuan, and transactions decreased even more. At the end of the week, prices rose by 1.4 yuan to 1.8 yuan, while number 96 fell by about 1 yuan. The total number of transactions was only 34.11 million, plus 4,000 in spot goods, with a price of only 49 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Farmland Case Undeveloped, American Cotton is Firm Near, Weak Far</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, and colleagues and foreign companies bought in. The Far East bought in far-month contracts. Each month rose by one to six pounds. Then, when the cotton hoarding was at 11.25, the March contract was sold, and the market price fell back. Later, colleagues and foreign companies bought in again, and the market price rebounded. Colleagues are still waiting and watching in view of the European political situation and the undetermined development of the farmland case. The Smith China case has been compromised. 10,000 to 40,000 bales of borrowed cotton are sold every week. The closing was very firm. The spot price rose by two pounds, and the futures price rose by one to fifteen pounds. The spot price of British cotton rose by four points, and the futures price fell by one point. Indian cotton merchants hedge sold, which was offset by the replenishment of empty accounts and the purchase of July contracts by speculators. The price of Pingguoer rose by 0.75 rupees, Aomula rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi rose by 1 to 1.25 rupees. The original telegraph record on the left (7th telegram): 193.5 rupees, up 2 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grain: Cloudy Change, Yuan Rice Rises Another 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 30 shipments arrived from various sources (more than 7,000 shi of goods). The sales market in this street is still good. Wholesalers did not open due to eating plate problems, so although the market was fresh in the afternoon, the prices of thick japonica rice and thin indica rice did not fluctuate much. Duyang pointed rice has no distinction. The price of hard-changed yuan rice is firm, and the central market is stable. Changbang white japonica rice is 10.6, Jiashan late indica rice is 9.70, Songjiang Lu sharp rice is 9.8, Youbaiyuan rice is 9.6, Youyinyuan rice is 9.45, Youyin rice is 9.45, Chuanmiao early indica rice is 9.7, Xitang late indica rice is 9.50, Hangchuan late indica rice is 9.90, Youyinwu rice is 9.75, and Ku late indica rice is 9.65.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 23 shipments arrived from various sources in Hexia. The market demand for various goods was good. White indica rice was shouted tightly in the morning market, but turned stable in the afternoon. The price of thin indica rice rose by 7 or 8 cents. The changed yuan route saw activity, with a price increase of 2 jiao. The price of special customer rice was tightened by about 1 chi. The price of Yangdubu indica rice was also tightened by a few cents. The prices of other colors were fixed.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Among them)</p>
<p>Men and women are equal, so men treat women as playthings, and women treat men as beasts of burden. If someone says that men treat women as playthings and trample on women, then men can also say that women treat men as beasts of burden and trample on men.</p>
<p>Cangjie created the character "男" (man) as composed of "田" (field) and "力" (strength), meaning that men use their strength to cultivate the fields. Probably Cangjie had never been to southern Fujian. If he had gone to southern Fujian, he would have known that the character "男" (man) he created was wrong, because in southern Fujian, women mostly work in the fields, and men enjoy happiness at home. (Ping notes: There is no such situation in southern Fujian?)</p>
<p>Men are as gentle as lambs to women before marriage, but become authorities after marriage. Women are inviolable saints before marriage, but become captive slaves after marriage.</p>
<p>A popular saying goes: "Foolish girls and unfaithful men." In fact, the unfaithfulness of men is frivolous love, and the foolishness of women is blind love. Both are not right.</p>
<p>Men and women mostly hold the same mentality, that is, they may have many lovers, but the other party should maintain unique chastity.</p>
<h3>The Children in the Streets</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Recently, when I often pass through Bazilu, Baoshan Road, Zhabu Road, and Tangen Road, I always see the same two middle-aged men and women and a child of only four or five years old sitting in the cold corners of the wall. Whenever someone relatively well-dressed walks by there, they say something to the child. Then, the child runs over like he's been instructed, follows the passerby, stretches out a dirty little hand, and says:</p>
<p>"Sir, young master, give me a copper coin! Good sir, good young master, give me a copper coin..." If you give him a copper coin, he will fly away to give it to the middle-aged man or woman—perhaps the child's parents?—Then, he asks another passerby in the same way.</p>
<p>This year, everything is being renovated with new tricks. I still remember the street performers from the past who used to perform tricks. There were monkeys begging for money, and dogs kneeling to enter. This would make the audience laugh, and the copper coins would naturally be thrown down. Of course, those street performers thought that it would be much more effective than asking people for money themselves. Later, those merchants wanted to attract customers in a certain business or make their income richer, so they would occasionally use similar techniques. But I didn't expect that now these money-beggars would actually want to win people's pity easily and teach children to do this kind of trick. Although this is also the cleverness of the money-beggars, I should worry about those unfortunate children. Did the society teach them to do this? Or does the family want them to do that? I believe that if this continues, a large number of small beggars will be produced in the society in the near future.</p>
<p>There are really too many people who don't have enough to eat in the current rural areas or cities. It is useless to give a few copper coins generously on the road. It seems too unworthy to cultivate many beggars invisibly. So I myself can't understand, is it better to give him copper coins? Or is it better not to give? Sometimes I just feel sad for these ignorant little lives!</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that those gentlemen who care about children's education and are shouting "Save the children" will first "Save the children in the streets."</p>
<h3>In Memory of Zhu Qingyun</h3>
<p>— Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Zhu Qingyun, a colleague at this newspaper, styled Qingyun, and I have been friends for over a decade, understanding each other deeply and treating each other with sincerity. Now, he has prematurely passed away in the prime of his life, a feeling akin to the sorrow of losing a sibling. He was skilled at writing novels, having produced several Yang Zhifang detective stories, scattered across newspapers and magazines in Shanghai and Suzhou. He once presided over the editorial duties of the Daguangming Daily in Suzhou, his writing sharp and incisive, yet his personality was straightforward, disregarding consequences, which often led to setbacks, but his character remained unchanged. He relied on writing to support himself, but his health was weak and unable to endure hardship. Our friend Shoujuan often helped him, but it was still sometimes insufficient. Yet, he was upright and cherished his integrity, refusing to take even a single straw if it wasn't earned through his labor. Fortunately, his wife, Madam Gu, was virtuous and frugal, ensuring the household didn't fall into destitution.</p>
<p>Last year, he changed to managing the editorial affairs of the Minsheng Daily, and his income decreased, often making him sad and unhappy. I comforted him and sought help from a close friend, who was also a man of emotion and readily agreed, only saying it would take a little time. On February 17th, a letter arrived from this friend, saying things were settled and asking me to convey the message. I was overjoyed and immediately sent a letter to him on the 18th. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 19th, he sent someone to report his illness and summoned me to visit. I happened to have injured my leg and had difficulty walking, but I still forced myself to go to his residence. I saw that he had a severe cough, and although his fever wasn't very high, he was breathing rapidly and sweating profusely. I tried my best to comfort him and talked about the new job to cheer him up. His wife told me the cause of his illness: he had received a letter from Mei Qingchu the day before, saying that Zhang Shuliang had invited him to the Mingbao to manage the editorial affairs, probably out of sympathy for his situation and to offer assistance. At that time, his health was already not very good, and his wife feared he wouldn't be able to handle staying up late working, so she tried to dissuade him. He sighed and said, "I want to live. As long as there's a breath left, how can I not work?" Alas! The whip of life is cruel and merciless. Who knew he would eventually sacrifice his life for it? It turned out that he had worked all night and came home with an illness, from which he never recovered!</p>
<p>Two days later, his wife came and said his illness had worsened, with profuse sweating and constant hiccups. Doctor Gu Furu had already been asked to join forces with Doctor Chen Luzhen to treat him. I was bedridden due to my injured leg, so I asked my wife to visit and introduced my friend Tao to examine his sputum, which revealed it was a severe case of pneumonia. For several days, I sent a young servant to inquire, who reported that Doctors Gu and Chen were visiting his residence every day, providing meticulous treatment, and the hiccups had subsided slightly, seeming to indicate some improvement. I was greatly relieved, hoping he would recover without the need for further medication. Unexpectedly, on the morning of March 1st, my wife went to visit again and found him in his final moments. Alas! He often called my name during his illness, saying he wanted to see me, but I was bedridden and couldn't visit him again. By the time I could go with a cane today, he had already left this world, his eyes closed forever! How tragic! (He has no descendants, and his funeral arrangements are simple. Fellow writers, if you can contribute funeral donations, please send them directly to No. 10, Xiansi Lane, Suzhou. Also, Doctors Gu and Chen were not acquainted with him, but they sympathized with his situation and waived all consultation and medication fees. Their righteous hearts and noble character are truly admirable, so I specially mention them.)</p>

<h3>Observations</h3>
<p>— (Xie Yun)</p>
<p>One sunny afternoon, while strolling along the road, I suddenly heard the distant clang of gongs approaching. Some people with white cloths tied around their waists and white hats on their heads were riding bicycles, leading the way. Behind them was a music band, playing trumpets and drums in harmony. Thirty-two people carried a coffin covered with embroidered red satin, walking slowly. Sons and grandsons, holding bamboo staffs and weeping, followed behind the coffin. Relatives and guests were seated in carriages, followed by more than a dozen cars carrying people to the funeral. Behind the cars, countless mourners wearing white hats and white clothes, holding incense sticks, followed. This was a rich man's funeral: prosperous in life, and prosperous even in death. Crowds lined the streets, watching the spectacle and lamenting as the deceased went to heaven!</p>
<p>Not long after, the rich man's funeral had completely disappeared, leaving behind a desolate scene. In the distance, two people carried a stark white coffin, not yet painted, hastily following the path of the rich man's funeral. Behind them was only a woman in white clothes, a white headscarf, and white shoes, sobbing, along with two small children. There wasn't even a single person to lead the way. The scene was extremely bleak. No one gathered on the sides of the road to watch. Those who encountered them hurried to avoid them. This lonely deceased person had struggled alone in life and went to hell alone in death!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Greed Values Nothing Lightly; Husband Reluctantly Parts Ways; High Aspirations Show in Shuangzu’s Journey to the Wilderness</p>
<p>Like Zhiqian, Beihai also put his hands in his pockets, standing with his head down, just smiling. When he smiled, he kept tapping his toes on the ground. Then he dropped his heels, tapping on the ground like hitting a board. Zhang Lao Han watched from the side, at a loss, just staring at the two of them blankly. Zhiqian smiled: If you don’t answer, I’ll take it that you have no intention of going forward with this marriage, and I'm going to back out of the agreement in front of this old man. Beihai hurriedly pulled his hands out of his pockets, making a ripping sound as he pulled at the pockets, as if he had torn a hole. He didn't bother to check if his clothes were torn, and waved both hands wildly, saying: Why is Mr. Cheng so impatient? Zhiqian smiled: What's my rush? We know there's someone who's very anxious. Let me tell you, that Miss Zhu and her grandmother and mother can leave the Hu family and move to Zhang Lao Han's house, he doesn't want any rent. According to the tea boy, that Mr. Jia's one hundred and fifty yuan, they also divided up some, so I think there's no problem for the money for sesame cakes right now. In this way, there's at least three months' hesitation time, can't you think of a way in Xi'an? I just personally went to the Hu family and discussed it with all three generations. It's just that this Hu woman lost such a cash cow of a relative, and is very sad, she's still asking people to mediate. Beihai listened, smiling and listening with his head down, saying nothing. After thinking for a while, he suddenly clapped his hands several times and said: I completely understand this matter, I completely understand this matter, it's easy to deal with Old Jia. I need to find my family once, Mr. Cheng, if you have anything to tell me, I'll find you tonight for guidance. He grabbed the hat on the table, put it on his head, and jumped out, saying: See you tonight, see you tonight. The words he said, were either repeated twice, or repeated more than once, and he disappeared in the farewell sounds. Zhang Lao Han looked at this situation, he was from another century, but he didn't quite understand, just standing there blankly. Zhiqian smiled: Old man, do you think this young man is very promising? He nodded his head and said Yes, he will definitely become an official in the future. Zhiqian said: Why must being an official count as promising? (412)</p>

<h3>Worldly Wisdom and Human Affairs</h3>
<p>— (Hu Dexian)</p>
<p>The common catchphrase people use is "worldly wisdom" and "human affairs". On the surface, they are two nouns, but when explained, their meanings are actually quite similar.</p>
<p>I often hear old people say that someone is very good and understands worldly wisdom and human affairs, but I have always been skeptical of this phrase, questioning what it actually means.</p>
<p>Now I can use an example to illustrate. Suppose someone brings you a basket of fruit and asks you to assess whether the price is a good deal. Of course, that person will let you sample a few, because this is a matter of human affairs and worldly wisdom, and everyone is expected to do it. But there are also some strange people in the world who, after showing you a few fruits, will take them back, pick up the basket, and leave. Some people say that this kind of person doesn't understand worldly wisdom and human affairs. I don't think it's that simple. There are many reasons that we need to explore!</p>
<h3>Leftovers from Fisherman's Lyrics</h3>
<p>— (Ai Mei)</p>
<p>From a young age, I studied rhymes and particularly enjoyed Zhang Zhihe's Fisherman's Lyrics. The poem goes:</p>
<p>"White herons fly before Mount Xisai,</p>
<p>Peach blossoms flow with mandarin fish so plump;</p>
<p>Blue bamboo hat, green raincoat,</p>
<p>In the slanting wind and fine rain, there's no need to return home."</p>
<p>The imagery is serene and the scenery is like a painting, which always captivates me.</p>
<p>But I heard from a friend that this poem actually has five verses, and the other four have been lost. He once recited them from a manuscript and showed them to me, saying:</p>
<p>"A fisherman on the fishing platform wears a brown robe,</p>
<p>Two or three small boats are drifting along;</p>
<p>Capable of rowing, connecting the flowing stream,</p>
<p>There's no need to worry about the white waves of the Yangtze River."</p>
<p>"A fisherman is angling in Yunxi Bay,</p>
<p>Taking a small boat as his home, wandering west and east;</p>
<p>Snow on the river, wind beside Pei,</p>
<p>Smiling at the lotus flowers, not lamenting poverty."</p>
<p>"The host in the crab shed on the Songjiang River is happy,</p>
<p>Wild rice and water shield soup are shared together;</p>
<p>Maple leaves are cold, reed flowers are dry,</p>
<p>Sleeping drunk on the fishing boat, unaware of the cold."</p>
<p>"The moon is perfectly round in Qingcao Lake,</p>
<p>The fisherman from Baling returns singing with his oar,</p>
<p>Fishing cart, upturned boat,</p>
<p>Happy in the wind and waves, unaware of the cold."</p>
<p>They seem inferior to the one originally passed down in terms of workmanship and charm. I don't think they were faked by later generations. I will record them here for reference.</p>
<h3>Palm-Leaf Sutra</h3>
<p>— Cai Zhezun</p>
<p>The ancient palm-leaf tree of Tibet has leaves like banana leaves, which can be used instead of paper. Scriptures are often written on them, also known as "Brahma pod." A Song dynasty poem says, "There must be many palm leaves for translation here." However, many palm-leaf scriptures are later forgeries, and genuine copies are extremely rare. General Qi Gongzi Xiu, the salt commissioner of Wu, has a marriage connection with General Su Dehai of Haizhou through their children. The Su family used to have an ancient palm-leaf scripture in their collection. When Yuan Shikai was in power, he offered a large sum to purchase it and sent staff to the Su residence to request a viewing. They recognized it as a genuine copy and offered to increase the price to 50,000 yuan, but the Su family firmly refused to sell. The scripture had previously been stored at the Qi residence, and I took the opportunity to view it as well, but it was later returned to the Su family. The palm leaf scripture consisted of over eighty leaves, yellowish-gray in color. The long ones were over a foot long, and the wide ones were over two inches wide. The original leaves were probably not this size, and I suppose they were trimmed at the time to make them uniform. The leaf material was thick and soft. When held up to the sun, fine veins could be seen, intertwined like a banana leaf fan, confirming that it was a naturally grown plant and not man-made. The scripture was written horizontally in Tibetan script. I don't understand Tibetan and I don't pay attention to the Inner Canon, so I dare not make any casual comments on its purpose and why it is so valuable.</p>
<h3>On Ink-Stained Bamboo Leaves</h3>
<p>— Wang Chunbo</p>
<p>Five li below the Taoyuan Cave in my Yi County, there is a local product of tall bamboo. Its peculiarity: the leaves all have ink marks, and the color does not fade even after rain and sun exposure. Legend has it that Li Qinglian (Li Bai) once traveled here and wrote poems on the stone wall, and the bamboo was stained by his brush. Another saying is that it is caused by the coal mine buried nearby. However, as far as I know, it is actually because the area (past this is only apricot trees) is near the graphite ridge, and the bamboo is usually affected by its quality, resulting in this anomaly. Therefore, Li Bai has the line: "Grind the graphite peak, catch red fish in Xunyang, the tip of the misty peak is like a brush, suitable for painting but not for writing." (Miscellaneous poems of 　Mountain) Sun Janting also said: "Steep peaks are chiseled again and again, Yi Mountain has a famous site, the aura is concentrated, and ink stone is produced here. Why is ink stone precious? It is matched with jade slips in the study." Furthermore, Weizhou is a famous area for producing ink. The "Man Yi Jian Zhi" says, "Between Yi and She, Li Tingpi made ink especially well!" The ability of Hui ink to be so good is actually because it has natural ink stone as its raw material. In view of this, the ink-stained bamboo leaves below the Taoyuan Cave in my Yi County are also related to the graphite peaks, so what is so strange about it?</p>
<h3>The Sovereignty of Love</h3>
<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>An old man, relying on the magic power of money, can be in love with a young girl. An old woman, wrapped in chicken skin-like skin, cannot make a young man bestow love upon her. The sovereignty of love belongs to men, not to women.</p>

<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>Old Age Phlegm and Asthma</h3>
<p>— Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>The phlegm and asthma disease of old age, commonly known as asthma, usually occurs in people over forty years old, with coughing and wheezing that disrupt sleep. It is often caused by colds and results in many deaths.</p>
<p>The pathology of this disease is bronchial spasm, similar to pertussis in children, so it is necessary to take special cough-suppressing and phlegm-removing medicine to dilate the spasm, which can quickly cure it. According to my clinical experience, I highly recommend "Bufei Nare" as remarkably effective, the medicine cures the disease. For infant pertussis, each dose is usually taken half a pill to one pill, three times a day, adults take it according to the instructions. Many people have been cured. Colds turning into asthma are truly miraculous, and this medicine not only contains hormones from the liver, lung, and pancreas of turtles, bears, and deer to strengthen the stomach, increase appetite, strengthen the body, and prevent and treat all stages of tuberculosis, but also because it is a lecithin replica, it is a good medicine for smokers' coughs and addiction treatment. Please make sure to look for the words "Bufei Nare" when purchasing. The raw materials are pure, and regular consumption can prevent tuberculosis and strengthen the body.</p>
<h3>Nutrition and Health</h3>
<p>— Li Fumin</p>
<p>Appetite and stomach capacity are often overlooked by most people, but in fact they are the most dangerous. For example, excessive use of the brain, excessive labor, or unexplained loss of appetite are all causes of dangerous conditions such as gastric ulcers and stomach cancer. A strong appetite leads to good nutrition and lifelong health. Consider farmers and laborers, who eat several bowls of rice per meal, so their muscles are well-developed and their spirits are vigorous. For ordinary people to enjoy this kind of health, they can only purchase and take "Qiangwei Jing" to promote appetite. For example, Mr. Guo Jinrong, who lives in Jiangwan, was thin and withered, suffering from nocturnal emission and insomnia, weak stomach and poor appetite, frequent acid reflux, abdominal distension after eating, and aversion to food. He suffered for eight years, and repeated medications were ineffective. Later, he came to me for diagnosis and treatment. I first used German "Butikang" to cure his insomnia and nocturnal emission, and then instructed him to take "Qiangwei Jing" for half a month for fundamental treatment. Before he had finished a few bottles, his food intake had greatly increased, his complexion had turned red, and now, half a year later, I met him at an Apricot Blossom Restaurant gathering. I saw him devouring food greedily, the dishes scattered about, and he was even stronger than ordinary people. He repeatedly thanked me deeply.</p>
<h3>Clinical Experiment Record of Lung Disease</h3>
<p>— Dai De</p>
<p>Coughing, sputum, and hemoptysis, the spark of life restored</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Jin Zhongchi, 26 years old, businessman. Cause: Early years were harmed by masturbation, leading to a thin and weak body, which then contracted tuberculosis. Symptoms: Initially ignored, then frequent coughing and sputum, with blood in the sputum, stabbing pain in the chest and ribs, soreness in the lower back, insomnia and spermatorrhea, dizziness and poor appetite, and a listless spirit. Various medications were ineffective. After four years of delay, he was introduced to me by colleagues Peng Si and Yongjun for treatment. Prescription: I diagnosed that his lung disease had reached the second stage and could not be cured by ordinary treatment, so I strictly instructed him to purchase and take "Bufei Nare" for two weeks, which stopped the coughing, and the blood sputum was cured. At the same time, he took German "Butikang" to treat brain weakness and insomnia, and to stop spermatorrhea, which produced miraculous results. His appetite greatly increased and his spirits were reinvigorated. Because he wanted to go to Guangdong to do business, he came to my clinic, and I used 　 light to examine him. His lung condition had improved by 70-80%, but because it was not completely eradicated, I advised him to rest temporarily. However, he was forced by livelihood and insisted on asking for guidance on recuperation during the journey. After informing him of the regimen, I also instructed him to continue taking the above two medicines, which would guarantee a radical cure. Last month, I suddenly received a letter from him from Guangdong thanking me, saying that it had been nearly three years since his recovery, and his weight had increased to -135 pounds. He was not tired even after heavy labor. He will soon return to Shanghai to get married. Night Sweats and Phlegm Suddenly Arise</p>
<p>Night Sweats and Phlegm Suddenly Arise</p>
<p>Patient: Mr. Yu Yishou, 43 years old, writer. Cause: Working at his desk all day, using his brain excessively, and improper conditioning, which led to hemoptysis. Symptoms: High fever of 38 degrees, hemoptysis filling the basin, coughing and excessive sputum, shortness of breath, excessive dreams and little sleep, palpitations and night sweats, physical weakness and emaciation, exhaustion, and repeated treatments that stopped the bleeding but failed to eradicate the root cause. He did not come to me for treatment until last spring. Prescription: Diagnosis showed cavities in the lungs, and the sputum contained many tuberculosis bacteria, indicating the disease had reached the terminal stage. I instructed him to take "Bufei Nare" to coagulate blood and reduce fever, and to eliminate cough and sputum. At the same time, he took German "Butikang", which allowed him to sleep peacefully at night. After taking a total of four bottles, all his ailments were gone, and his chronic illness suddenly disappeared. I then instructed him to continue taking the previous medicines for more than a month to ensure that it would not recur. After that, he would not need to come to the clinic for treatment. He recovered completely, his essence was strong and his spirit was sufficient, he was not afraid of hard work, and he was not afraid of the cold. He could write thousands of words while leaning on his horse. He had been to the health department more than ten times to test his sputum, and there were no traces of tuberculosis bacteria, proving that the root cause had been eradicated. He came to my office a few days ago for something and told me the above.</p>
<h3>Good News for the Infertile</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Berlin's McLean Magazine says: Irregular menstruation, abdominal pain during menstruation, dark blood, and infertility after prolonged marriage in women are often caused by diseases of the ovaries. This disease is also often seen in incomplete development of the ovaries themselves, or 　　　　　　 due to injury (such as 　 masturbation, excessive sexual activity, etc.). As a result, 　　 the maturation of eggs is interrupted, resulting in incomplete uterine development, and lack or disappearance of corpus luteum and 　 cells, or insufficient stimulation of ovarian hormones. All of these are the main causes of menstrual diseases and infertility in women.</p>
<p>Regarding this treatment, there are many advocates for organ therapy recently, but due to the difficulty of manufacturing this kind of organ preparation, many failures occur. Recently, Dr. Mellon invented a hormone preparation called "Bu Nü Rong," which makes up for the previous shortcomings. This agent is extracted from the 　 ovarian hormone of young female animals. Its function is to transform egg cells and promote their vigorous function. It has been repeatedly tested on animals with incomplete ovarian development, and the results have all been very satisfactory. It was then used on humans, and the same excellent results were obtained. It can sweep away all kinds of menstrual diseases and infertility, neurasthenia, insomnia, headache, blurred vision, back pain, leucorrhea, etc. in women.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Bed Report by Dr. Yao Juyan</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road. Hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>The Most Difficult to Treat Gonorrhea is Cured</p>
<p>Among the difficult-to-cure gonorrhea cases, the most important is chronic paraurethritis.</p>
<p>The reason why this disease is difficult to cure is that our paraurethral glands are very deep, and the small holes where they open are as thin as hair. Once the gonococci spread to this area from the posterior urethra, it is difficult to capture them easily, and most people with paraurethritis have clean urine, which also causes patients to lose their attention. However, if examined under a microscope, many gonococci are often mixed in, so people with paraurethritis often unknowingly transmit gonococci to their wives, which is a matter of long-term fear. 　 Mr. Zhang Shouping, who lives on Hebei Road, also suffered from this disease and transmitted it to his wife. His wife was cured after taking "Ke Lin Nong". However, Mr. Zhang was confident that his disease had been completely cured and suspected that his wife's disease was not transmitted by him. Therefore, he earnestly asked me to examine him. I first examined multiple times under a microscope, and gonococci were indeed found in his urine. Re-examined with serum, and the result also showed a gonococcal reaction. After examining for a long time, I finally learned that the lesion was in the paraurethral tube. So after using 　 line and electrical therapy. I also used the internal medicine "Ke Lin Nong". After more than a month of treatment, it was completely and fundamentally eradicated. Then, after using various 　 stimulation and serum tests and other methods, there was no gonococcal reaction from beginning to end. Therefore, he can be assured of a radical cure.</p>
<h3>Experimental Photographs of Ke Lin Nong, a Special Medicine for Treating Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wen Jingsheng</p>
<p>(1) Urethral Stricture</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Xue Yongguang, residing on Xizang Road, had suffered from chronic gonorrhea for six or seven years. Initially, due to livelihood problems, he ran around, and had not completely cured the disease, which caused the virus to deepen day by day; the urethral opening was so narrow that it could not hold a grain of rice, so urination was unusually difficult. Usually, when urinating, it was necessary to insert a rubber tube. Because of this, symptoms of uremia appeared; later, he came to me for treatment. I performed surgery to drain his urine, then used the German gonorrhea miracle drug "Ke Lin Nong" for internal use. After two weeks, the 　　 completely disappeared, urination was smooth, and he was 　　 to continue taking it for two weeks, and his urine color was 　　. About a month later, he was radically cured. I heard that since this radical cure, Mr. Xue has never relapsed, even after high stimulation such as sexual activity and drinking, which proves that the efficacy of "Ke Lin Nong" is not comparable to other drugs, no wonder it is unanimously recommended by world-renowned hospital doctors.</p>
<p>(2) The sensation of ants walking in the urethra</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Wang Yunpan, 21 years old, residing on Beijing Road, felt gonorrhea on the fourth day after prostitution, with itching and burning in the yin, easy erection and spermatorrhea, testicular swelling and pain, blood in the urine, frequent urination, and then the urethra became swollen, pus blocked the opening, making urination even more difficult. He came to me for treatment, and after washing the anterior urethra for him, I instructed him to purchase "Ke Lin Nong". After taking only two bottles, all the symptoms disappeared. He was radically cured after continuing to take it for three weeks. After a blood test, it was confirmed that the root cause had been eradicated. I received a letter from him yesterday, saying that he has not relapsed even after drinking alcohol and exercising, and that it has been two years since then. I am truly grateful.</p>
<h3>How to Recover Youth</h3>
<p>— Zhou Youren</p>
<p>Masturbation has become an open secret in both male and female youth. It is equivalent to bloodletting. The secretion of the youth glands is damaged, and the body deteriorates day by day. Muscles become thin, or because the blood of parents is depleted, and they are sexually exhausted, the children born are insufficient. All of this causes incomplete physical development, short stature, or seeming strength, but dizziness and headache, premature aging, sore back, insomnia and forgetfulness, palpitation and anemia, pale and rough skin. In men, nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, impotence and hardness, women have irregular menstruation, leucorrhea and infertility, and the breasts become thin and itchy. This is the reason why mankind is becoming weaker day by day. The German Institute for Race Improvement, in view of the ineffectiveness of ordinary endocrine preparations, invented the collection of endocrine secretions from the two sexes of sea dogs, orangutans, lions, and tigers in their youth, and refined them separately into the two major tonics for men and women, "Butikang" and "Bu Nü Rong", which can best regenerate youth gland cells, fundamentally transform the weak functions of congenital inadequacy and acquired damage, make muscles strong and the skin beautiful and tender, so insomnia and weakness are cured immediately. Male leakage and impotence, short vitality, female menstrual diseases and infertility, flat breasts, can all be cured. Also, because it contains a large amount of lecithin, it can be used during the quitting period for both men and women, quickly breaking the addiction and curing old diseases, avoiding relapse. There are no bad or inferior qualities in the medicine. If taken for a month, the back will be strong, the spirit will be refreshed, and you can walk dozens of miles a day without fatigue.</p>
<h3>The Latest Great Invention in Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>On January 5th, the German Medical Research Association held its national annual meeting. All attendees were well-known scholars from the German medical community. Among them, Dr. Transberg, a specialist in gonorrhea, presented a paper on the treatment of gonorrhea, which caused a stir throughout the conference. It was stated that gonorrhea medication must have a systemic antitoxic effect. If it only kills bacteria locally through the membrane, the gonococci in other parts of the body and in the blood cannot be completely eradicated, making it difficult to cure the disease completely. However, the "Clinon," a new wonder drug for gonorrhea recently invented in Germany, has these multifaceted effects. Initially, fresh gonococci were injected into cattle and sheep to produce a natural antitoxin. Then, the lipids that produced this antitoxin were processed into an oral tablet called "Clinon" using special scientific methods. This medicine was then administered to other cattle inoculated with gonococci (i.e., artificially infected). When their urine was examined under a microscope, it was found to contain a large number of blood cells excreted from the blood, actively migrating and feeding on the gonococci. At the same time, there were many dead gonococci in the urine. After a week, blood tests of the cattle showed no gonotoxic reaction. After repeated tests without failure, the drug was administered to human gonorrhea patients. Regardless of acute or chronic gonorrhea and inflammation of the testicles and joints, it can quickly penetrate the membrane, kill bacteria, exert a systemic antitoxic effect, and achieve a rapid cure. Dr. Bisberg treated more than 2,000 people with this drug, and none relapsed after recovery, whether they got married, engaged in sexual activity, or consumed alcohol. It is truly the most thorough medicine, it is said.</p>
<h3>Letter from Mr. Jiang Xiaoxian of Nanjing</h3>
<p>Five Years of Arthritis and Orchitis Cured Suddenly</p>
<p>(Omitted above) I have suffered from gonorrhea for many years. Doctors, both Chinese and foreign, in Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, have treated me extensively, but the disease has not improved. Instead, my joints and testicles became swollen, making it difficult to bend and stretch, causing severe pain and sleepless nights. Later, introduced by Dr. Huang Muhan, I went to Dr. Yao Juyan in Shanghai for treatment. After the first week of shortwave electrotherapy, the pain was reduced. In the second week, I was treated with X-rays, and I could move freely. In the third week, I received injections of the latest German anti-gonorrhea serum, which completely eliminated the swelling and pain, and the gonorrhea was quickly cured. In the fourth week, I underwent surgical massage, which made my bones and joints feel exceptionally comfortable throughout my body. In total, the treatment lasted only a little over a month, and the old gonorrhea of five years was completely cured. I feel as though I was given a new lease on life and am deeply grateful. Now, more than a year later, I am strong and healthy. If it were not for Dr. Yao's skill, I would not have been able to express my gratitude to the world. Patients with the same disease cannot hope for a complete cure without Dr. Yao's treatment.</p>

<p>Semen Leaks Out</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Keming asks: In my youth, I masturbated, and semen leaked out. Starting half an inch from the base of the glans, there is an inch that is slightly thicker than the rest of the penis. Please advise on how to cure this persistent illness.</p>
<p>Answer: This is because masturbation has damaged your prostate during adolescence, leading to incomplete development of your reproductive organs. You can take "Buti Kang," which should stop the sperm leakage and ensure complete development.</p>
<p>Lung Disease with Night Sweats</p>
<p>Mr. Yin Renjie asks: I have been suffering from lung disease since I was 21 years old, and it has been five years now. I am emaciated and have night sweats every evening. My appetite has decreased, and I have taken various medications without improvement. What medicine is the best for me?</p>

<p>Involved with Prostitutes</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Boying asks: I was previously involved with prostitutes and contracted gonorrhea. Taking medicine and injections have had little effect. What steps should I take to treat it?</p>
<p>Answer: It is best to seek treatment from Dr. Yao Juyan first. Before receiving treatment, you may want to take "Clinon," which is also very effective.</p>
<p>No Dreams of Bears</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Runpu asks: My wife has abdominal pain every time her period comes, and she has a lot of vaginal discharge. We have been married for five years and have not had any children. What medicine can cure this?</p>

<h3>The Home of "Justice"</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>In the eyes of most people, the term "justice" simply does not exist; it is merely something to deceive people. Hence, the saying "Might makes right" is often recited by people. However, the reality is not so. What occupies the world is not entirely might. Might is only a small part. Beyond might, there are a vast number of good people. So-called justice originally exists among the vast number of good people in the world. The error of the past saying "Might makes right" lies in seeking justice within might and forgetting to seek justice outside of might.</p>
<p>A Havas news dispatch from March 2nd states: Peace-loving youths from various countries held a meeting in Brussels, representing twelve million youths from thirty-two countries, to protest against Japan's aggressive actions in the Far East. They also proposed intensifying sanctions against Italy for its invasion of Abyssinia. This is one aspect of justice that exists among the vast number of good people in the world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Reuters reported from New York on the 29th of last month: American anti-war protesters demonstrated in front of the Japanese consulate, "warning the Japanese warlords against their aggressive actions towards Outer Mongolia, Soviet Russia, and China," stating that these actions "will cause hundreds of millions of people to support the invaded nations." This is another aspect of justice that exists among the vast number of good people in the world.</p>
<p>Moreover, Reuters reported from London on the 25th of last month: "Students from various schools in Shanghai held a demonstration on December 24th of last year to oppose the so-called autonomous movement in North China. During the demonstration, they clashed with the police of the Public Concession. During a meeting of the House of Commons today, Communist Party member Gallacher questioned Foreign Secretary Eden about the number of students injured and arrested, and the number of injured students under the age of sixteen. He also asked whether the British-controlled police had the right to suppress demonstrations by ordinary Chinese people protesting against Japan's policy towards China." This is yet another aspect of justice that sympathizes with us.</p>
<p>In addition, the expression of world sympathy for our justice is repeatedly seen in newspapers and has been very, very many times, too numerous to record. Who says there is no justice in the world? Justice exists among the vast number of good people in the world. If you go to a gang of robbers to find justice, the result will naturally be a smack in the face.</p>
<p>Accepting the world's sympathy for our justice is not easy either. "Heaven bestows gold" is simply not true. Accepting justice also requires paying the necessary price. Ultimately, justice must still be sought in blood!</p>

<h3>Illness</h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>——Written to My Future Self——</p>
<p>I thought the world was only me left.</p>
<p>Besides myself lying in bed, spacing out in this tenement room, there was nobody else. I really felt irritated: If I keep burying myself in this tomb-like room, maybe that would be the end of my life. Everything in the tenement room, like the peeling and mottled walls, the table piled with books and other random stuff, the magazines and old newspapers strewn all over the floor due to a moment of anger and carelessness, the dirty quilt that I don’t know who covered me with, the newspaper in front of the bed stained with black and yellow phlegm because I was preparing to spit into it, the news of murder and arson printed on the newspaper... all this made me uneasy and angry.</p>
<p>I really wanted to force myself to get up and destroy everything, everything.</p>
<p>The room was suddenly as big as a desert. There was no water and no roses in this desert – but I never liked roses, I didn’t even like any flowers. Similarly, I never had a thermos bottle, in case I needed some water. At this moment, I was a bit abnormal (You could say I was completely abnormal). I needed water, I needed roses, or any other kind of flower. Because of this, what I needed was always a fantasy. Thus, I could easily get overly uncontrollable and angry.</p>
<p>At this moment, I believed – no need to lie – if anyone walked in, they would probably have really bad luck. Because I would definitely go crazy and beat them, as if venting all my frustration on that one person would make me feel better. But I didn’t do that, not just because no one ever walked in during my long, lonely illness, but also because I thought afterwards: If I did that, I definitely wouldn’t succeed, mostly because I didn’t have any strength at that time, and partly because I would immediately regret it, constantly regret it.</p>
<p>This is because I understood that the heaviness of the illness was entirely due to having too much time to think, making me trouble myself more and more, becoming more terrifying, and isolated.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reason I resented illness was entirely because it gave me loneliness, isolating me from everyone. Confining me in a room that could be said to have no air at all, allowing me to carefully sort out the feelings and punishments I have received these past few days——</p>
<p>"I can say," I unwillingly plunged into painful ideals again. "If a person is disturbed by one pain, the other pains will come looking for him together, annoying him, just like a bunch of debt collectors to a bankrupt person. Just like after Faust was bewitched by the devil, it was entirely due to his momentary carelessness, and the devil never left or stopped harassing him.</p>
<p>"All of this, for example. Let's use everything as an example. I wish it would never become reality——</p>
<p>"A road, or a thing, or something else, that is about to, maybe will immediately make him get the result, and this result can happily give him supreme comfort, and at the same time this result is what he thinks is the most indispensable and as important as eating. It can also be said that this result is his responsibility, is his path, or nothing is more important than this… But this failed due to an unspeakable reason. This pain is indescribable, and also cannot be described. These eroded him, made him receive ‘punishment,’ which is a thousand times, ten thousand times greater than his ‘crime.’</p>
<p>“Like this, all the unsatisfactory things come to disturb him, taking advantage of this opportunity, which can be said to be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. At the same time, all the ghosts he knows come to bother him, making him unable to sleep peacefully for even one night; making him think of all these pains whenever he has free time——Obviously, of course, there’s absolutely no chance of mistaking it: This is me.”</p>
<p>This time, I forced myself to stand up. In any case, no matter what time, I never thought about illness, or hoped for illness. I only complained about illness, cursed illness, and even ridiculed all the friends who were ill. On the contrary, I quite boasted about myself, and as surely as a geometric formula, I asserted that I would never be brought down by illness.</p>
<p>Now, all of this has become a mockery. No matter how foolish, or even idiotic a person is, they would not mistake me for a healthy person who is completely free of illness. Although maybe I would, and even force them to say the opposite of what they think.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you could say suddenly, I looked at myself and cried, and laughed loudly and miserably. I felt that if I wasn't crazy, I definitely wouldn't treat myself this badly. To still be angry when you are sick, that is the world's biggest idiot. Where did the courage come from, or you could say it was encouraged by a friend's words, I got up, not forced at all, neatly, methodically, and began to transform this desert-like tenement room, making myself satisfied and comfortable.</p>
<p>I thought to myself: If time doesn't allow me to have idle fantasies, all illnesses will not disturb me. I laughed again, I heard that the laughter was gentle.</p>
<h3>Nora (7)</h3>
<p>— Wan Chao Chen and Xin Xin Cooperation</p>
<p>Nora: Do you really not love your husband? If that's the case, why did you marry him in the first place?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: At the time, my mother was still alive, lying in bed unable to move. And I was taking care of my two brothers, so I felt I shouldn't refuse him.</p>
<p>Nora: Was he rich at that time?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: He was doing alright. But his career was unreliable. When he died, it all fell apart, and he didn't leave anything behind. Later I opened a shop, started a small school, and tried everything I could to support myself.</p>
<p>Nora: You must have felt your life was very free!</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: Nora, not necessarily. I just felt an indescribable emptiness. Living in the world wasn't for anyone, but I still had to work hard all day long. And because I had to live, I became selfish, only caring about myself. At the time, I heard you were doing well – do you believe me? – I was happier for myself than I was for you.</p>
<p>Nora: What do you mean? Oh, I understand! You were hoping Torvald would help you? Christine, I'll definitely get him to help you.</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: Nora, you're so good to me, putting in so much effort to help me! Especially since you haven't been through much hardship, it's even more rare.</p>
<p>Nora: Me? I haven't been through much –?</p>
<p>Mrs. Linden: (Smiling) Well – but you know a little bit about light handywork and things like that. – Nora, you're still a child.</p>
<p>Nora: You're just like them. You all think I'm someone who can't do anything serious –</p>

<h3>Early Winter in Qingyang Port (12)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>——This is simply not winter, look, the north doesn't have this scenery.</p>
<p>——That's right, it is still Jiangnan after all.</p>
<p>The train rushed past station after station, from Nanxiang, Huangdu, driving Zhuo Min and Qiu Hua out of Qingyang Port. Crossing the iron bridge, was the Garden Hotel run by the railway. As soon as one stepped in, one saw a lotus pond with a stone tablet erected in the middle, inscribed with the four characters "Lotus Blossoms in Pairs". Although there were no lotus flowers anymore, these four characters were already enough.</p>
<p>——Look, "Lotus Blossoms in Pairs", we went there, as if there was such a backdrop of a match made in heaven. To catch the train, it was just a little short. The seats, not only were the two we just sat in freed up. When we arrived at Qingyang Port, it was "Lotus Blossoms in Pairs", and such a good place was set aside for the two of us.</p>
<p>——That's right, this place is too good.</p>
<p>Lunch was prepared, three dishes and one soup, for two people. The dining hall was so quiet. Rather than saying this was a hotel, it might as well be said that it was a private villa. Zhuo Min asked the waiter to bring two glasses of French Vermouth. That refreshing wine! As long as you think about it, close your eyes, in the quiet dining hall, two people in love, a little wine, what an unexpected encounter this was for Zhuo Min. He felt that the gathering of people was truly immeasurable. Two years ago, when he first met her, although her liveliness and grace had left a deep impression on him, because of friendship, because of human feelings, he did not have any thoughts, and this impression had already disappeared helplessly. Who knew that two years later, they would be Tete．a．tete in this quiet villa! This was really helpless, this was neither Love at first sight, nor doing flirtation: He finally had no way to make her but go on this road. For Qiu Hua, wasn't it also like this? She didn't love him at first sight, she didn't expect that she would love him like this. However, what could she do, making her confirm herself. For Zhuo Min, he felt that his existence was only for Qiu Hua, except for Qiu Hua, he seemed to have never been born.</p>

<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Blowing)</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng flew to Tianjin by plane on the 3rd to meet with Japanese military officers. On the evening of the 4th, he held a banquet at Fukushima in the Japanese concession. Tan Lao San said: Yin has forgotten that he is Chinese, forgotten his ancestors, forgotten his country. How can this kind of person be considered Chinese? It is really wrong to recognize this kind of person as Chinese.</p>
<p>In the case of Mrs. Liu Shao's elopement, chauffeur Wu Wenxiang appealed to the High Court. The trial opened the day before yesterday, and Liu Xi appeared in court. Tan Lao San said that there are originally many such romantic cases of master-servant adultery in Shanghai. Some have been discovered, some have not been discovered, and some have been discovered and covered up. In this kind of case, you can't blame the young lady, and you can't blame the chauffeur. Most of them are due to the worship of money.</p>

<p>Opening "Baoyu Cries for Qingwen"</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>A standout among the maids in Grand View Garden,</p>
<p>Jade broken, fragrance vanished, buried underground.</p>
<p>Please, young master, wail loudly,</p>
<p>A belly full of complaints, all thoughts turned to ash.</p>
<p>An ignorant maid speaks foolish words,</p>
<p>Saying that she, a sprite of twenty-eight years, roamed the human world.</p>
<p>A celestial maiden descended to earth from the ninth heaven, crying for you,</p>
<p>Serene, dignified, virtuous, and prudent.</p>
<p>Suitable for anger and laughter, learning my ways.</p>
<p>Crying for you, clever and intelligent beyond compare,</p>
<p>A heart with exquisite sensibility, a great talent.</p>
<p>Crying for you, upright and straightforward, a man's ability,</p>
<p>Playful and innocent, like a child.</p>
<p>Qingwen, who among the four great beauties can compare to you,</p>
<p>Whom can be hailed as the first among women of all time.</p>
<p>Morning and evening together for only a few years,</p>
<p>How can a muddy jade be accompanied by a female immortal.</p>
<p>Qingwen, sometimes reciting in the cold winter days,</p>
<p>Only you, accompany me all night without fear.</p>
<p>Qingwen, sewing a fur coat while sick,</p>
<p>A thread is meticulously crafted with care.</p>
<p>Qingwen, that old woman Wang deserves to be killed,</p>
<p>Stirring up trouble, daring to advance accusations.</p>
<p>Qingwen, Madam listened to slanderous words,</p>
<p>Forcing you to return home, burning the zither and boiling the crane.</p>
<p>I stood by and watched silently, wrongly so.</p>
<p>Like, forcing Yang Guifei to death at Ma Wei.</p>
<p>Qingwen, you pleaded in vain and left in sorrow,</p>
<p>Saying how, a beautiful face is a cause of trouble.</p>
<p>Qingwen, your wronged soul returns to the ranks of the immortals,</p>
<p>Still being, a happy flower goddess returning to uncarved jade.</p>
<p>Qingwen, the desolation in the garden goes unnoticed,</p>
<p>Only I, the master of the Yihong Courtyard, knows the sorrow.</p>
<p>After crying, I burn paper money,</p>
<p>The cold wind howls through the night, chilling the garden.</p>
<p>Hair-raising, I quietly return.</p>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>Mao Zhizhong Art Training Class</p>
<p>Navigation Industry (1180) 5:30 PM to 6:15 PM Art and the Masses (1) The masses need bread. If they do not receive the nourishment of art spiritually, their inspiration is scorched by fireworks, and their intelligence is poisoned by the stench of fish. Recognizing the low taste, ordinariness, emptiness, and disappointment in life leads to pessimism, and the loss of courage leads to numb living corpses.</p>
<p>Echoes</p>
<p>Today at 6:15 PM, the Transportation Radio Station will broadcast Mr. Lin Leyi's speech "Youth Problems"</p>
<p>In today's most tense period of striving for national liberation and saving the country, the broadcasting industry has yet to show any activity. Singing groups are still offering songs like "Love is Like a Rose" and "I Love You" to the market. Drama groups are still catering to the audience with comedies like "The Proposal." Not to mention Suzhou ballad openings? Or do people in the broadcasting industry have their own paradise?</p>
<p>The Bug Sound Society plans to publish a new type of ten-day magazine, with content divided into sections such as "Drama," "Broadcasting," "Music," "Film," and "Literature and Art," with particular emphasis on news reports from various departments. Contributions and photos from all walks of life are welcome. The address of the society is No. 11 Yongqing Lane, North Railway Station Boundary Road.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Fan, who recently performed on stage for the Tianyi film "Two Brothers," her father is the "Saturday" school writer Zhang Xunzi, who is currently editing the Star Daily. (Above, Yu Yun)</p>
<p>Zhang Yingjun, the leading actor of the Mingmei Troupe, has recently organized the Qingge Art Society.</p>
<p>Chen Chushan of the Silver Star Singing Society and Miss Yin Lin, a member of the society, seem to have an unusual attitude.</p>
<p>Miss Xiao Daheng Liying has been extremely quiet for a while since leaving the Rose Garden. Recently, she has suddenly become very active again and has joined the Modern Society, the Lianyi Society, and the Chunxiao Troupe, a total of three groups.</p>
<p>It is expected that they will sprout and grow like spring bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>Miss Zhang Suzhen, the director of the Mingmei Troupe, has been eating Guanyin vegetarian food these days.</p>
<p>Xiao Wu Xu Qi, she wore a leather cheongsam and looked much fatter. (Above, Meng Ying)</p>
<p>The Yunyun Opera Society is now seeking six basic female members and four male members. Applicants should have at least a junior high school education, a love for singing art, no bad habits, and be between the ages of sixteen and thirty. After being accepted, the society will provide some travel expenses. Please send letters to Zhao Xin, No. 115 Zhejiang Road, Shanghai. If suitable, you will be notified by letter for an interview. No walk-ins please.</p>
<p>The Flying Rainbow Monthly, published by the Flying Rainbow Amateur Music Society, has released its second issue of the second volume. The supplement "Freedom" is edited by Mr. Wang Shiying, and the content is more exciting than before. It can be called the authoritative publication in the singing world. It is said that the publication welcomes subscriptions from other places for expansion purposes. The retail price is two cents per issue, and the annual subscription including postage is six jiao. The address of the society is No. 153 Yaozhu Road, Shanghai. (Wanxiang)</p>

<h3>Silver Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>"Two Brothers" claims to be a sexy film centered on sex, but according to those who have seen it, it is a "reformed Martial Ten Chapters."</p>
<p>(Confucius said: Isn't Martial Ten Chapters "sexy" enough?)</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Hua's leading stage performance of wonderful songs and dances includes the following programs: Jazz Dance, New Fisherman's Song, Fengdian Woman, and City Light.</p>
<p>If we had not forgotten the three public performances of Xinhua News Agency to attract movie stars, we would have been too disappointed in "Song Saint" Mr. Yan.</p>
<p>(Confucius said: If we hadn't forgotten Mr. Yan's other honorific title, it is said that his "peach blossom luck" is increasing daily.)</p>
<p>Carlton specially screened Xiang Xuehai for the anniversary of Ruan Lingyu's death. Mr. Jin Qingyu wrote a classical骈文in advance. The meaning is very good, but is it enough to screen a work as a memorial to a generation of artists?</p>
<p>(Yu said: My emotions are coming again... I might as well not say it.)</p>
<p>The "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" scene in the ice cream store</p>
<h3>Yi Hua News</h3>
<p>— Songzi</p>
<p>"A Flower" is Xu Suling's first directorial work, and it is now being actively filmed after "Incarnation Girl." This film depicts private love between men and women and has unique features. With Xu Gong's unique delicate technique to deal with this kind of plot, there is no doubt that it will have super-new achievements.</p>
<p>There are several songs in "A Flower," which have been made by singers such as Mr. Liu Xuechang. The tunes are sonorous and pleasant, and the lyrics are sad and flamboyant. Recently, the company's actors have praised it, humming and humming, and it is very popular.</p>
<p>It is said that Wang Cilong's "Father and Son Heroes" will adopt more horror shots to make the plot tense and fascinating.</p>
<p>Set designer Bao Tianming is very busy creating the dilapidated temple set in "Father and Son Heroes." He is now collecting information separately to make it as realistic as possible.</p>
<p>According to photographer Yao Shiquan, "He wishes he could be divided into two people, because he is in charge of the photography for the two films "Incarnation Girl" and "Father and Son Heroes," and he has been working hard on them at the same time recently, so no wonder he feels that the supply cannot meet the demand."</p>
<p>Yue Feng's new script "Little Tiger" has been decided to be abandoned due to review problems. A new script has now been written, tentatively named "Broken Heart Flower," which is a thorough new-style love tragedy. The preliminary script was sent to Beijing yesterday, and Hu Ping will be the performer.</p>
<h3>Silver Film Company is Preparing to be Established</h3>

In addition to using new talents for all the male and female protagonists, new talents will also be used for directors, set designers, etc. in the production, which will completely create the newest record in the history of Chinese film in a brand new posture. It is said that the first feature film to be produced is "Flood of Water."</p>
