<p>— 星</p>
<p>近者美國總統羅斯福訪問加拿大於奎白克城向歡迎者致辭謂美國與加拿大和平相處已逾百年兩國接壤三千餘里不設防禦而百餘年來未演流血之慘劇此良足為黷武世界之模範且謂最近美國與加拿大簽訂之互惠商的卽二國人民實施「善鄰政策」之明證此雖外交辭令語多粉飾然美國加拿大之國交殊可稱為國際關係史上之光榮部份睦鄰政策之成功亦不無事實之根據其原因及效果有足言者</p>
<p>美國之所以能推行「睦鄰政策」於加拿大蓋有二因卽美國對於加拿大政治上之不干涉及在經濟上之積極合作是也政治自主與經濟互助為和平之二大柱石非互尊互重兩國之感情何由和睦無互供互求則兩國之關係。何由深切美國對於拉丁美洲各國素主侵略於古巴及尼加拉瓜等或出兵勦亂或擅行廢立然結果衆怨沸騰徒年耗軍費及民力於政治經濟上均無所得反之美國之於加拿大除少數狂妄議員時有吞併加拿大之呼聲外一般負責領袖不存干涉加拿大內政之心故兩國得相信相賴相與合作互信旣立懷疑掃除雖有軍備亦失其作用矣</p>
<p>經濟合作必具政治獨立之條件不然則此合作類似殖民地與母國之關係不能謂為雙方眞正之合作僅能稱為單方之掠取耳美國對於菲列濱及中美諸國積極推行其經濟帝國主義然所得之經濟利益不若其得於加拿大者之十一此何故歟以合作為方式雙方受利其利乃宏以掠奪為手段雖有所獲亦不永久而易生反作用今之帝國主義國家如意如日勞師襲遠殘殺他國之人民吞併他人之土地而所得亦不足償其所失侵略及戰爭之無補於事安祺爾等已剴切言之矣吾東鄰之日本歐洲之意大利猶窮兵黷武以利刃巨艦為推銷其貨物之廣告術可謂不智之甚者矣</p>
<p>日本人士屢以敦睦中日邦交為口頭禪吾人再切實為彼邦人士告曰領土之完整主權之獨立為共存共榮之唯一基礎彼國如能以美國之遇加拿大者過我則經濟合作容有可能如僅以我為古巴之續則威脅之下必有反抗睦鄰何有哉共榮何有哉</p>

<p>— 本報記者胡仲持　胡一臧</p>
<p>這時候要去參觀另一個新聞王國——大阪每日新聞社－已經欠早了。我們直到次日下午三點鐘才去。</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞的社屋是一所近世復古式的七層大厦。在這內部，我們承東亞通信部記者上沼健吉的招待，參觀了兩個鐘頭。編輯窒圖齊室和活版工塲設在二樓，會議室貴賓室日本室攝影工塲和英文每日編輯室設在三樓，大阪每日慈善團事務所和點字每日編輯室設在四樓，營業室遞送塲和鉛版印刷兩工塲設在樓下，電氣室，機關室，紙庫浴室和公衆食室設在地下層，氣象觀測所和鳩舍則設在屋頂。主要各部門的機械設備在我們看來，跟朝日是大同小異的。電送攝影機和眞空運送機在那里都齊備着。印刷機共有二十三架，其中幾架速度最高的每小時可印報十八萬張。專用的長途電話綫通到東部的東京西部的福岡，這種裝置聽說是大阪每日所首創的。</p>
<p>我們在參觀的時候，向上沼君詢問了一切。從他的談話上，我們不但明白了大阪每日的組織系統（註），還知道了它的過去歷史的大要以及它所具有的種種特色。</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞是明治九年（一八八六）所創刊的「大阪日報」的後身。一大阪日報」辦了六年改稱「立憲政黨新聞」，到明治二十一年（一八九八）才又改稱「大阪日新聞」。明治四十四年（九二。）它跟東京「每日電報」合併起來，復改稱「東京日日新聞」作為「大阪每日新聞」的支社。於是大阪每日聲勢大盛。它和大阪朝日在日本新聞事業的最前綫並駕齊驅了。</p>
<p>大正十一年，（一二九二）大阪每日新聞社創辦了兩種特殊的報紙，英文每日和點字新聞。英文每日是日本人在國內自辦的唯一的英字日刊，請有名的學者新渡戶稻造博士主編着。點字新聞是專給盲人讀的週刊。全份共十六頁。文字用厚洋紙上凸起的點子組成不幸的瞎子可以在這上面摸着讀的。現在担任主編的是一個從英國康橋大學畢業的盲學者中村享太郞。</p>
<p>近年來每日王國的驚人的發展，有一大部分應當歸功於前社畏本山彥一。他說過一句有名的話：「新聞的權威是和記者的人格成正比例的」。</p>
<p>大阪飪日同大阪朝日一樣也宣稱着它是從皇室中心主義出發，對任何問題都取公平穩健的態度的。它聘請了一位「德高望重」的日本新聞界老前輩德富蘇峯（本名猪一郞）做報上的幌子。這位老頭子除給大每和東日的夕刊常作小品文和時事評論以外，還把一生的大著作「日本國民史」在大每和東日的朝刊上連續發表。他在這個報館里受着特別優厚的待遇。他的名義是社賓，他的年薪是日金三萬元。這樣的尊稱和這樣的巨薪在日本新聞界是少有的。</p>
<p>大阪每日新聞社現今取消了社長的名目。最高負責者是董事會長法學博士岡實。主筆是高石眞五郞。全社職工連東京日日在內共計三千三百六十餘人，比朝日還多。（朝日職工人數是三千三百人）</p>
<p>大阪每日及其所屬的東京日日的總銷數已經超過兩百萬了。可是比起大阪東京兩朝日來，銷數上似乎還差些。這兩個新聞王國現正用着全力互爭雄長。最近大阪每日用一百萬元的資本在甲子園開了一次盛大的博覽會，主要目的就在對於本身的宜傳。接着大阪朝日召開了一次關西體操大會，目的也一樣。大阪朝日在各大都市設立了宏麗的朝日會館，聯絡讀者社會的感情，大阪每日則備有日本唯一的有聲電影攝影汽車，收攝各處的新聞電影，租給一切公共機關映演，從旁面來宜揚「每日」的聲勢。</p>
<p>我們根據着浮面的觀察，可以就每日和朝日這兩王國粗略地來比較一下：朝日似乎比每日年靑些，每日似乎比朝日老成些。年靑的精神和老成的精神是各有各的長處的。</p>

<p>新家庭與衛生</p>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師主編</p>
<h3 id="c176">父母愛子女者應注意……　掠奪小兒生命之消化障礙 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— （沈兆荃）</p>
<p>消化障礙，為小兒最多之疾病，且甚危險。因消化障礙者，榮養必衰弱，各種疾病即容易發生，實為各種疾病發生之源。其原因大概為食物不適當，例如專用牛乳哺育一歲以內之小兒，及離乳以後，即給難消化之食物等。過度之飲食，亦足誘發本症。故小兒食物之種類與食量，最須注意！</p>
<p>本病之症狀無一定，輕者惟有極輕之泄瀉，常人概不注意之，重者則可致死。其普通症狀為泄瀉，綠便腹痛，嘔吐，腹部膨脹，腹鳴，不能安眠等。重者全身更發熱，食量漸漸减少，身體漸漸瘦弱，（亦有消化雖障礙，而食量並不减少，或反增加者。）</p>
<p>成人之消化障礙，固無危險，而小兒則因身體之發育未完全，往往奪其生命。據泰西學者之統計，小兒之死亡原因中，胃腸病實占五分之二。常人多以為小兒之消化障礙，與成人同，亦無甚危險每輕視之，致誤喪小兒生命者，不知幾許，育兒家可不愼之哉。</p>
<h3 id="c177">兒病之安全療法 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>凡小兒消化障礙，吐乳，下痢，綠便，腸內異常酸酵及腐敗，腹部膨脹，赤痢，霍亂，以及消化不良，食慾不振，身體消瘦，發育不良等。服用『敵腸痢」藥片Dysefrin　Tab．有著效。本品之完全無毒，對於兒體，安全無害。此尤為各國醫家所稱賞，認為病家自療有百利而無一弊之良藥。父母愛子女者，當此夏令，亟宜置備。以保兒童之健康。</p>
<h3 id="c178">母乳不足問題 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>乳汁之多少。對於小兒之榮養發育。關係至大。產婦於分娩之後。往往有乳汁之分泌不足－或竟涓滴全無者。是在醫學上名曰「乳汁缺乏症」，其原因或由於乳房發育不全。或由於疾病。或由於萎黃病及貧血症等虛弱體質所致。</p>
<p>OTAMNAM</p>
<p>其療法。應使母體全身之榮養佳良。精神安靜。宜多攝取含有蛋白質之食料。（或服用滋養强壯劑中之「康氏生活素」Conbour's　Sar-Vita-Cell一藥。補效允著）。他如行適當之運動。通理大便。多飲開水。牛乳。肉湯等物。近有生乳新藥「媽媽多」Mammato用於乏乳症。功效甚著。依據臨床經騐。大都於服用後三日內。即見乳汁之分泌旺盛。乳汁濃厚.滋養力尤為增大。故乳兒更見活潑壯健。發育滋長。較常兒佳良。且本品不特為生乳聖藥。對於母體之榮養。方得助力亦多云。</p>

<p>— 章元楨醫師</p>
<p>痢疾之病原。係一種細菌感染後所起。於夏末秋初間。流行甚廣。其主要之症候。為頻頻如廁。一日中少者十餘决。多則數十次。排便之時。腹痛如絞。裏急後重。病人輒蹙額咬牙。苦惱萬狀。排泄之物。或如膠。或如膿。或則純血。量祇少許。其臭甚惡。此外則嘔吐·呃逆·食思減退·舌苔枯燥。小便極少。重症則面色慘白。四肢厥冷。脈搏細數。體溫低降。聲音嘶嗄。全身痠痛。倘變成慢性。終必羸擭而死。</p>
<h3 id="c180">痢疾之家庭療法 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>（衛生）第一須安靜身體。就褥最佳。切忌勉强動作。飲食祇可食牛乳·鷄卵等無刺戟性之流動食物（米湯亦可）。且須溫熱者。一切米飯·麪包·肉湯等。概須嚴禁。飲料宜用淸開水。煩渴嘔吐者。可含碎冰塊或冷開水。除勵行一切衛生方法外。須內服「敵腸痢」藥片Dysentrin　Tab.　　（治療）最近新醫界盛行吸着療法。即服用「敵腸痢」Dysentrin　Tab.一日三四次。每决吞二至三片。對於下痢·腹痛等症候。均可迅速見效以至治愈。對於腸內細菌等有害物質。有極强大之吸着力。同時對於巳吸着之細菌。旣能制阻其發育增殖。幷有化學的殺菌作用。故為最新極合理而且安全之腸痢特效藥也。</p>

<p>— （編者）</p>
<p>女性之月經不調。足以損害健美。及促成不孕症。治療月經不調之藥物。市上雖汗牛充楝。但其有效者眞如鳳毛麟角。頗屬少數。茲有新藥「美奴寗」Menorrin曾經各國醫師實騐證明。專治月經不調各症。如月經閉止，月經疼痛，月經過多或過少。經期過早或落後。以及氣血虧損。赤白帶下等症。均有特著之效果。若常患小產之孕婦。服此藥亦可安胎保產。毫無流弊。故世界醫師公認「美奴寗」Menorrin為婦女之福星也。</p>
<h3 id="c182">觸目驚心之淋病 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 徐生章醫師</p>
<p>白濁又名淋病，為花柳病中傳染最易，而流佈最廣之惡疾患也。此症不僅足以危及我個人之健康，且能斷絕生宵之能力。近就新醫家調査報吿，謂今世之絕嗣者雖多，而因本病造成者，實佔百分之七十以上，其故蓋因生殖器被害，以致不能受孕故也。卽幸而成孕，亦易流產（小產）或姙娠期滿，其於分娩之時，胎兒經過產道，其產門部之白濁病原菌，甚易侵入胎兒之眼目中，而引起白濁性結膜膿漏眼（即風眼），三日不治，必至失明，遺恨終身，故此症為患之烈，較之梅毒，有過之而無不及，洵可畏之亡國病也。</p>
<p>然我國同胞，多因鮮有科學常識，每有因本病不發現於身體之外部，莫不以為在花柳病中，係最輕者。加以一般初息者羞愧人知，不受醫治，或旣受醫治，尙未痊愈，即中途停止醫治者，再或因購用不正賞之藥品，以致遷延時日，急性變為慢性，輕症變為重症，病毒升堂入室，痛苦莫甚於此，是時雖欲求治也，難乎其難矣。茲特將關係木症之攝生與治療法，略述于後，用吿讀者諸君，深望閱後，廣為宣傳，務求此症，日益减少，非完全撲滅此病不已，則亦我社會之幸焉。</p>
<h3 id="c183">經濟有效之白濁自醫法 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>（一）　生法白濁之治法，首重攝生，患者不可過勞，禁止遠行及劇烈之運動，其所食物品，亦宜選擇富於滋養料，而易於消化者，倘富於脂肪性及刺戟性之食物，如猪肉，烟酒，辣椒，生　，胡椒之類，概須禁絕不食。整理通便，而對於房事，更不可行。</p>
<p>（二）內服藥療法近今巿上治淋之藥，日出不窮，其中良莠不齊，故選擇甚覺困難，今依據各醫師之實騐，及多數病家之報吿，咸認“918，”Anti-Cono-Tab.（九一八白濁片）之功效最佳。且售價較為低廉，頗適合於經濟病家之購服云。至於服用方法，可參閱其說明書，本篇不贅述焉。</p>
<h3 id="c184">疰夏與神經衰弱 <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>一般人因天氣炎熱。感覺疲勞，四肢乏力，精神萎頓，作事懶惰，思想散亂，食慾減退等現象。此及俗有「圭夏」之謂。研究其原因。實為人體虛弱。缺乏活力之故。以致神經受其影響。而新陳代謝之機能衰退。遂以發生種種疲勞症候。</p>
<p>若體力強健之人、雖至炎熱天氣。絕不感覺疲勞及衰弱病態。倘體質　餿。素有神經衰弱症者。在此盛夏炎暑之際。愈覺神志困頓，肢力倦怠，頭重，失眠，頭痛，耳鳴，目花，腰　背痛，思想支墩，記憶減退等。凡此種種皆為神經衰弱趨於嚴重之象。因此，患者須勵行修養。採用適當方劑。以滋補其神經。恢復精力。是為至要</p>
<p>然通常之補藥。多性熱而不宜於暑天。若患者服用不當之補劑。則流弊滋多。往往反招致損害胃之　。故於夏期服用補藥。可不慎乎？</p>
<p>茲據多數醫師臨床實騐之報吿。此種神經系補劑中以「米美面補腦汁」Memory　Neurotic有百利而無一弊。因本品之調製合理。效力顯著。尤其藥性和平。無燥膩滯積之弊。對於胃腸絲毫無害。</p>
<p>『米美爾補腦汁』MemoryNeurrotic為補腦，造血，強精等名貴藥劑所精製。對於人體各部之　損，腦弱，貧血，神經衰弱等症。確有面面顧到之補充能力。故極宜於夏令調補。其效益之大。非任何補劑所可冀及。凡有「圭夏」之苦者。一經服用本品之後。能立刻恢復其神經活力。血液旺足。思想　敏。精神愉快。上述各種疲勞症候。均見迅速消失。全體生活現象佳良而健壯異常云</p>

<p>— 上海愛多亞路馬霍路西首均樂邨六號　肺病專家沈兆荃醫師撰述</p>
<p>罹患肺癆者。有易治。有不易治。一般樂觀之人易治。悲觀之人難治。總之，多憂慮者。終陷不治。然肺病在近世新醫學而言。本為易治之疾病。决不可自己預存悲觀。須以堅强之意志作為療養之秘訣。嘗觀信仰宗敎頗深者。豫後較良。亦屬此理。概以彼之意志堅决。務與病魔相奮鬥而征服之之故也。尙須注意老。切勿迷信虛偽的治療法。如採用丹方或其他不正當之藥品。以致妨害眞正之療養。往往因此而功虧一　者甚多。是不可不切戒也。</p>

<p>喘息－俗有氣喘，痰喘等名稱。凡患此症者。其呼吸多不暢。呼吸之時。每發出一種聲響。有若吹笛。常病未來之前。先覺全身違和。肢體僊怠。心悸亢進之預兆。亦有毫無預兆。猝然於夜間發作者。初時病人突然醒覺。胸內苦悶。或於半睡半醒之間。自驚夜魘。於是呼吸乃漸惑困難。皮膚蒼白。面色靑紫。眼球突出。喘鳴頗著。不能言語。因苦悶而跪坐於臥上。冷汗淋漓。如此經二三點鐘。得以漸趨和緩。各症消失。遂覺爽快。因疲勞而熟睡。此後全復健康。有時症候並不全消失。而反復至數星期之久者。本病當發作時雖無危險。惟因肺之機能衰弱。久之必續發肺氣腫。於是難保無生命之虞焉。</p>

<p>（國民海通社）八月六日柏林電、德國報界對於美國運動健將歐文思之成功、均有詳細紀述、據報界意見、歐文在一屆世運能獲金牌三枚、及創立大會兩個新紀錄、此種威風、將在運動史上永留不朽、據說芬蘭長跑家瑙密亦曾雄旺一時、曾奪獲金牌四枚、但歐文思如能四百公尺接力賽獲第一名、尙有機會平等瑙密之紀錄、</p>
<p>記者對歐文思問彼成功之秘訣何在、歐氏答曰「吾以體育家之生活為生活、此是否成功秘訣、」德國跳遠健將郞格、此次曾獲跳遠第二、彼曾謂「歐文思祇跳彼所需之　　遠度、如彼能遇對手則彼可跳過八公尺、無論如何、彼必能改良自已紀錄、彼舉動輕快、技術上亦甚有心得、故在跳遠方面、能得如許成功、」</p>
<p>哈瓦斯五日柏林電、男子二百公尺决賽、於本日午後舉行、觀衆極多、歐文思以二十秒七獲得冠軍、打破大會紀錄、（二十一秒六）</p>
<p>二百公尺决賽時、適遇順風、且風力頗勁、奧氏遂又得風伯之助、但渠善於短跑、起步之後、始終居首、其奪獲錦標也、如探囊取物、毫不費力、歐文思之為短跑第一能手、又於此項决賽中、獲一明證矣、</p>
<p>（國民海通社）八月五日柏林電、美國黑人短跑健將歐文思、今日二百公尺决賽復打破世運紀錄、歐文思在大會中所獲金牌此為第三枚、（一）歐文思（美）二十秒七、（二）羅賓遜（美）二十一秒一、（三）奧生達普（荷）二十一秒三、</p>
<p>歐文思在百公尺及跳遠之成功、巳成為此次世運之注目綫、彼之令名在運動史上永不失為英雄、在二百公尺决賽時、歐文思之雄姿復呈於十萬觀衆之前、從發步起、歐氏卽列前茅、壓倒羣敵、歐洲健將奧生達普、最後努力祗趕回若干距離、但卒不能與第二名美選手比肩、</p>
<p>前世運紀錄為二十一秒一、為美國黑人吐侖在一九三二年所創、現時世界紀錄為美國洛基在一九二六年所創二十秒六、</p>
<p>歐文思在十一屆世運個人在田徑賽中獲三金牌、為前此所未有、故祗此一點、已成為世界運動史中之一頁光榮史、芬蘭之瑙密（Nurmi）曾在世運獲四金牌、但瑙密是在三屆世運之總成績、故與歐文思在一屆所得者不同、</p>

<p>（二）（六）紅海中一幕　悲劇</p>
<p>十三日夜裏郵船穿過亞丁灣、航進紅海、碧落的海水、平靜得幾乎不現一點波紋、大家於飽受驚濤駭浪之餘、走到　樣一個安逸的境界、眞是非常舒適、</p>
<p>紅海長達千一百餘英里、最闊處的二百英里、最狹處祗十六英里、兩岸都可在望、紅海的南岸是阿拉伯沙漠、北岸是非洲大沙漠、在兩大沙漠蒸　之中、氣候非常炎熱、據說就是因為炎熱的緣故、才給把「紅海」這個名字、與海水的顏色、是沒有絲毫關係的、</p>
<p>十四日的早晨、一碧晴空，火傘高張、甲板上張起帆布蓬、仍不能抵拒炎日的燄威、吸烟室裏的電扇、加速度的開着、但是坐在裏面、亮晶晶的汗珠、就如泉水般的湧了出來、海面上吹過來的微風、滿蓄着熱氣、一切器具摸上去都有點炙手、下午到了馬蘇河、船停風止、沙漠中的熱氣、蒸騰得更使人頭痛腦脹、就在這樣熱流襲擊之中、萬想不到竟會發生一幕悲劇、有一位在爪哇政府任職的荷蘭人、因吿老退休、同了他夫人和一子一女、由新加坡登輪歸國、這位先生、年約五十許、體重二百磅、態度很和靄可親、同輪十多天、同我們相處得很熟悉、尤其是他的十五歲的女兒、與十三歲的兒子、天眞爛漫、同大家玩得更親熱、他們也住在經濟二等艙位、鄰近機器間、更為悶熱、十四日的夜裏、他到甲板上納凉、感覺有點不舒服、回到房間裏、沒有多久、竟突然與世長辭了、十五日早晨、大家聽到這個悲慘的消息、都覺得異常悽惻、而感着人生的虛渺、照船上的規矩、旅客在中途辭世、是應該舉行海葬的、下午六時船上下了半旗、開了慢車、船長穿了禮服、為他舉行一個簡單的追悼儀式、就把遺體裝在木箱中、慢慢的沉到海底裏去、聽說船上還有四個工人、都做了熱流的犧牲者、遺體都悄悄的投入海中、與波臣為伍、葬身魚腹了、</p>
<p>（二）（七）馬蘇阿的印　象</p>
<p>十四日下午二時、輪次馬蘇阿、雖然火傘高張、汗流浹背、但是因為這個地方、是義阿戰事中一個重要的軍事根據地、所以下去觀光的人、仍是很多、</p>
<p>馬蘇阿是義屬以里特里亞Eritrea的首邑、也是唯一的商港、地當紅海的斜面、為歐亞交通的要道、其重要不亞於英屬亞丁、與法屬吉布的Jebute、以里特里亞本來是阿比西尼亞的國土、後來割讓義大利、現在義大利就以以里特里亞為根據地、連阿比西尼亞都完全呑併下去了、當義阿戰爭正在進行的時候、所有義國開往非洲去的軍隊、北路方面、就是以馬蘇阿為入口的要道、我們現在親臨其地、一面瞻識了帝國主義者猙獰兇惡的面目、一面回想到祖國破碎的河山、與困苦艱厄的國運、眞是不禁心驚胆裂、　郵船走近馬蘇阿海岸的時候、我們老遠就看見許多軍艦與商輪、停泊在那裏、這些軍艦與商輪、都是義大利的、因為其他各國的船隻、在馬蘇阿是從來不停泊的、郵船靠停的時候、看見許多有色的與無色的勞苦工人、在幾個軍官指揮之下、很忙碌的在做着運輸的工作、幾十輛運輸汽車、往來得也很頻繁、這顯然表示義阿戰事雖已吿一段落、但是軍事上的布置、仍然方興未艾、</p>
<p>馬蘇阿這個地方、可以用「沙漠的地帶、軍事的重鎭」、兩語盡之、全鎭範圍很小、至多同我國大一點的鎭市相彷、完全建築在沙漠上、房屋都很破舊、氣候異常炎熱、我們在所有的街道上走了一遍、祗看見一個電報局、（郵局附設在內）和不到十家極小的店舖、其餘的房屋、除住宅外、都是軍用、</p>
<p>街道上塵灰飛揚、齷齪不堪、且奇臭刺鼻、令人作嘔、除掉幾株棕樹外、看不見共他的綠葉、這樣一個荒凉的地方、好像是不値得人留戀的、但是因為牠是阿比西尼亞的門戶、義國把牠看作生命的源泉、無怪沃地千里的我國、要為人覬覦了、</p>
<p>土人皮膚黑得眞如鍋底、而且狀貌猙獰、印度人與之相較眞是小巫之見大巫、男女上身都赤膊露體、下身圍了一塊顏色的布、在無色人種指揮之下、很勞苦的做着牛馬的生活、渾渾噩噩一望而知其為無知無識、這樣的民族，除非沒有人去宰割他、才能獨立生存、我這樣的寫、决沒有為帝國主義者張目的意思、不過處在這弱肉强食的時代、一個民族要想生存、是非講求生存之道不行的、我們在馬阿蘇看了這幕尖銳化的對立的現象、想想自己的現狀、眞是不寒而慄、</p>
<p>郵船於下午八時離馬蘇阿、繼滬前進、船上又增加了六百名旅客、他們都是義國的工人、在義阿戰爭中、都是為他們的國家盡過一份責任的、所以他們雖然規定在三等艙、但是經濟二等的甲板及吸烟室、頃刻間都玻他們佔領、我們的選手們、幾無挿足之地、所幸航程已為日無多、預計十七日可抵博賽（PortSaid）、十日可抵威尼斯（Venice）登陸了、</p>
<p>（二）（八）三等艙裏的</p>
<p>記者在第一信裏、曾提到三等艙艙裏幾十位同胞、昨天我去訪問了他們、在汚濁的統艙與甬道中、他們在地板上舖了一條蓆子、遠渡重洋、我們與之相較、眞有天壤之別了、</p>
<p>他們都穿短衫短褲、是十足的農村代表、一共有一百卅名之多、都是浙江人、其中一百多是溫州人、二十多靑田人、據他們說都是到歐洲去經商謀生的、究竟到那一國、現在還沒有定、大的要到了歐洲闖着再說、我問他們到歐洲究竟做什麼生意、除很少幾個人說帶了一點茶葉和其他的土產外、其餘都說到了歐洲再看、我又問他們為什麽一定要到歐洲去、他們的回答是國內不能生活、但是據他們自己說、每個人的旅費、至少要四五百元、在中國的社會裏、有四五百元資本、並不是一定不能開闢一條生活的道路的、所以我除掉佩服他們的男氣、與冒險精神外、對於他們到歐洲去的動機、眞是有點莫測高深、有一位吿訴我設，他們的船票是托人代辦的、計十七鎊、上船後、才知道祗要十二鎊、船上的伙食、每日兩餐、規定一鎊、但是郵船公司祇給廚子八元、而據他看來、這樣的伙食、由上海到威尼斯、一共要不到兩塊錢、這雖不免過甚其詞、但是這班飄泊的可憐虫、到處被人剝削、這是鐵一般的事實、</p>
<p>靑田人之在歐洲、巳有很長久的歷史了、據說在光緖末年、有一個靑田人、帶了一點靑田特產的石子、不知如何偷偷的到了法國、居然發了財、以後一個傳一個、去的人一天一天多了、最盛的時候、全默洲竟達三四萬人、現在尙有三萬人、幸運好一點的能在國外成家立業的固然也有、但是大多飄流異土、生活仍是毫無辦法、因此他們無所不為、在國外不知製造了多少笑料、為國體不知遺留了多少汚點、駐在歐洲各國的使領館、無時不在想法把他們遣送回國、可是有冒險精神的靑田人、仍是一批一批源源而去、我對於這枝新出去的生力軍、唯有祝禱幸運之神、能隨時隨着他們為我們國家多少保留一點體面、（七月十七日寄自博賽）</p>

<p>— 美國紐約巿大學敎育家敎授梅戈登著　劉伍夫譯</p>
<p>金家巷農村念二社經濟活動報告、將這種計畫的具體功用說明了、在這區域內的工人、大多是紡織·洗衣·種植·籐工·手工紡織團的工人裏面有二十個年老的和二個年輕的婦女、從事手車紡織、那是新式紡織發明筆就被遺忘了的、籐工合作團設在一個團員的家中、那裏的工作就在一個有技巧的工人管理之下進行的、成人們只在晚上工作、小孩子則在白天從事製造籐具的實際工作、或從事閱讀·游戲·運動·講故事、以及其他的普通集會、種植合作團管理四十畝的耕地、耕地的百分之二十五種小麥、其餘是種蔬菜的、他們已用科學的方法來改良種子和實行輪種、就是對於昆虫管理也實行了、洗衣合作團有一百五十多家、所洗的衣服都是參加合作的大學生供給的、要繼續從事這種工作、須得學習指定的工課、</p>
<p>附近念二社的分子都有幾種固定的計劃、他們規定時間舉行全體大會、特的路旁的房子、改進公共衛生、時事報告討論、並處理臨時醫藥診斷等等、他們訂定公共契約、不奉教、不花費金錢去從事迷信、每天要學習讀寫五個生字、早晨起來、很有規律的工作及早餐、</p>
<p>很明顯的、這種敎育計劃是中國民眾所需要的、念二運動創立者的文化敎育程度、與美國的智識階級是一樣的、他們是領導者、他們指示民衆、成為現代學生的模範、他們又指示中國民衆的需要、這些、我們美國人早就從賽珍珠的小說裏知道了的、中國的民衆、大多數是農民、他們住在鄉間、每人每年只有三十到四十元的進款、他們的生活、只是依賴最簡單的最節儉的生活為標準、西方的教育、不僅超過他們的需要與理解、而且是超過他們的經濟意識、由於西方教育的急運輸入、對於社會的傷損、有些地方已經很明顯了、這種計劃礎很好的、因為他是計劃整個民族的發達、而且是逐漸進行的、</p>
<p>從念二運動的發展上是值得我們注意的、牠是依據進步教育的良好路綫從事於強有力的建設、牠的使用、基於個人的需要與興趣的方法、舉個例子、從事領受　具的工人、就可用做算學教育的基礎、收獲的良好與否就可導入太最光的性質與效能的硏究、這種運動是戶外的、他規定學生參加公共的社會經濟生活的實際工作的方法、用經濟活動貫穿文化與社會的敎育、這已經迅速的傳播了、謹在三年前建立的運動、已經普及了六省、設了一〇五個合作團體及其他組織、會員有二一五二〇人、無疑的、這種鄉村教育運動的方式已經被中央敎育部很關心的注意到了、他們對於中國社會改造的工作將要引起全世界的興趣呢、（釋自本年六月」亞細亞」雜誌）</p>

<p>昨日粉市、已呈一番新局面、因交易所奉令撤銷限價、一月份亦如期開價、惟沉悶已及一月、且洋麥之漲勢劇烈、是以市場情形、橫跳之後、又難免業外之投機、遠期漲六八角不等、坎拿大近漲一元零、遠漲八九角、故大部分人心、一致狂熱、惟本月份開價、尙覺近情、初價祗一角四分、升至四分七釐半、較前日不過漲三分、不料九月份開價卽漲六分、後又升一分半、故至十月份遂狂提一角、（交易所規定每日之漲跌、不得超過隔日收盤角）、十一、二月份亦均漲一角、無復其他開價、良以業外仍有吸收、所以漲勢邁前、毫無回顧、一月份係初次開始、曾開至三元四角零七釐半、二盤開始、本月份亦狂提至三元二角、後則多頭回出、漸漸反跌二三分、九月份則依然高昂、距一角限盤、祗差半分、十月份至十一月份、均漲至限盤、一無動靜、一月份則廣方略出、亦回跌二三分、觀於粉市發展之狂特、已不得就常理相推測云、</p>

<p>昨華商證券交易所、因三十三及五十二號止賣、五十二號且轉有買進、大戶進出靡定、人心亦隨之混沌、場上謠傳、復興公債、行將登場、向無大交易之十五號、忽有大批買進、五十二號轉賣為買、三十三號則不再出籠、不過十號之一貫賣出不已、惟昨日祗質出、均係限價脫手、比較稍緩、查十號卽以前之七十八號、交易極鉅、故前途縱不上漲、亦不過盤旋而已、昨日經過、開盤初拍、散戶賣出、戊種頗軟、經十五號吸收而穩定、此後卽見由堅定而轉漲、四號十號十六號均有賣出、三十四·四十七及五十三號等均有買進、丁種起一律上漲、甲種漲六角為最多、次盤一致上漲、惟堅而不俏、大都好一二角左右、市價結果、一致回漲二角至八角不等、成交總數、共計四百四十九萬五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）、</p>

<p>公餘金菜公司自組織成立以來本為同業謀互利起見、但為時未及一閱月、現因各行意見相左、故由昨日起已決定解散、仍由各行各自為政、詎料公司一經解組、號方貨價立趨堅挺、昨市鎮帮開盤、如大興菜等開十九元半至十八元半、比前漲起元許、各帮聞訊均起爭辦、市勢為之大振、後防續緊、</p>

<p>新蟶干、今庚國內、各地收穫、均報鹽稔、今日各貨來源、甚為踴躍、且貨品絕佳、非但色光黃亮、而身骨尤燥、故頗為客帮所歡迎、現市行盤兜售中隻建蟶九十元、小隻八十元、安東大中蟶五十二元、中隻四十二元、烟台中隻蟶三十七元淮河中隻蟶四十元、次者三十二元　江北竹蟶三十元、至二十五六元、後如到貨不絕、各橋市均看跌、</p>

<p>昨日棉布雖紗花突又回昂、但因棉產旺盛、現紗存額孔多、期貨紗花趨勢軟弱、在棉布銷塲雖甚賣好、然僅囿於一隅、川蜀長江陝諸路略見增　、而北略　津烟　銳減、月日商銳意　北　、已見實施、目下北路去貨、日少一日、少數　貨中以本廠綫呢嗶嘰直　最占多數、昨各　平穩、本廠細斜微落每疋五分左右、　人中　細斜紅百合加官等牌五六十包、　四五十包、及細布嗶嘰直貢花絨等貨百餘件、川帮　、昨　怕和三桃三　白絨念餘箱、花素嗶嘰直　五十餘箱、長江沿　各埠　續均有添辦、獨江浙內地生意最形清閒、</p>

<h3 id="c244">從潼關到首陽山 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 宗人</p>
<p>站在黃河邊，風陵渡口的山頭上俯瞰對岸，　關全市似乎就廻旋的擺在眼底。倘從隴海路車站那一叢紅房子起，則路旁的樹林，全烟雲樣的一直迤邐着貫穿過那古老的城市，直聳遠山，而隱入一朶似隱似現的山洞裏。</p>
<p>再遠處，距潼關三十里，是華山。五老峯靑蒼的疊立在雲霧裏，山腰的寺院也還依稀可辨。潼關脚下，便是滾滾激流着的黃河；不時有一兩聲打水聲，和渡船上老船夫的吆喝聲，靜靜地　上來；在寂寞的山灣裏，彷彿更　出了睡夢樣的空氣。</p>
<p>風陵渡距首陽山，山路只得三十里。我們從潼關擺渡，在渡口乘預置的汽車，行程也只需四十分鐘。但在這四十分鐘裏，現實的遭遇和懷古的幽情，倘是詩人，實在要幾十首詩也描述不完的。我想到當年李白在這地方醉後吟詩的事，不禁也默默地有些感慨了。</p>
<p>這晋陜交界處，並沒有十分顯著的分別。倘從細微處想：則在潼關的街道上，可以聞到烟土香；可以看見天九牌，和細磁茶碗什麽的一起，擋在街道上。而走入山西境，則這些就全換上了一個樣式。譬如烟土改名為藥餅，零碎的發行；賭具被藏在櫃底，悄悄的出賣。如斯而巴！</p>
<p>兩地的氣息，在感覺上，是一樣的。</p>
<p>我們這次的旅行，是受了同蒲路局的招待的，所以汽車一直沿着同蒲路的路基走。而同蒲路的路基，則多半是靠了黃河，——往下去是汾河的邊岸。</p>
<p>據路局派的招待員吿訴我，說這同蒲南路的全綫，要趕在十月十號通車的。所以那工程，處處全加緊。從各路調來的軍隊參加築路的，也就漸漸地多起來了。</p>
<p>汽車爬上一個山頭，再直駛下來。那情勢：就像要一瀉而入浩蕩的黃河似的，是頗增加人們的冒險性，而不時使我們發一兩聲駭呌的。沿路，那孤立在一層斷崖上，或竟是頺坍在一座廢墟前的　收的石像，也頗增加了我們的興緻。</p>
<p>所以我們這一夥，儘管是在暑熱的天氣下攢路，也全不感覺到疲倦，時間在大家的驚呌和感喟裏，就慢慢的溜過去！而汽車去了異外迅速的停在首陽山脚下了。</p>
<p>我們預計，在首陽山，是要有一兩點鐘的停留的。因為這兒，正是兵工築路的要站，也正是我們這個新聞攝影隊所必需攝制的處所。</p>
<p>但我們的工作却進行的不十分順利，那築路的兵士和長官，對於把他們收入　顛的事，全主張愼重。他們說，事前沒準備，所以衣服不整齊。「不整齊，拍出來像什麽樣？有損名譽。等下午換齊了衣服再拍吧，現在請你們先到下處坐坐！」那指揮築路的團副堅持的說。以致我們的工作不得不有些躭擱了。但大家却全不願意接收他們的招待，希望利用這空餘的時間，拜訪一下在記憶裏很熟着的「二賢祠。」</p>
<p>首陽山並不高，佔的面積也不大。並且看起來，疏疏落落，連個像樣的樹林子也沒有，很有些禿頭禿尾，像凋敗的破落戶一樣。但因為有古蹟可尋，所以大家也就不覺得牠那窮酸的面孔可憎了。</p>
<p>山半腰，汽車路旁邊，有兩座不十分高的塔，塔旁的一塊岩石刻着民國九年刻下的「伯夷叔齊之墓」幾個字。從這塔後灣過去，灣到山後，一塊荒落的草地上，才是眞正的二賢祠。</p>
<p>也許是今人不敬古吧，祠是已經破落得只剩下幾　坍毀的殿房了。而那殿房裏，如今也被第　軍　團的團本部所佔據。祠前的牌坊也和那枯了頭的柏樹一樣，顯得十分的沒出息。至於石人石馬之類，則多半缺頭少腿，甚至是只有半截，蹲在沙土裏。</p>
<p>祠旁一跨院，在荒草的埋沒裏，有弟兄兩個的墳。上首是伯夷，下首是叔齊。全祠只有一樣栢樹孤立在伯夷的墳頭上。據傳說，這也是為了「義」。叔齊離不開哥哥，所以把自己墳頭的一棵樹枯死，聯附在哥哥的墳頭上來。但看來那樹也很小，像是新生，所以這種節義的傳說，也就很　　了。</p>
<p>「愚乃大義」在所有的題字裏，全含這個意思。我想，伯夷叔齊的哲學，大　是很中了他們的意吧。因為那不食周粟，以至餓死的抵抗方式，在有些人的眼裏，是最合式不過的。</p>
<p>時間還早，大家離開二賢祠，就又　步到山腰的村落裏。這村落的房屋，倒是多半在古樹的掩映下的。奇怪的是，這村子裏似乎並沒有一個男人，只有些女人，和閃在女人身後夾着尾巴的狗，對我們的襲擊，睜着驚奇的眼睛。</p>
<p>我們全體，因為好奇，便全闖入一家私塾裏。私塾裏只有一些孩子，在搖頭幌腦的「子曰」，看見我們，便全停住了！</p>
<p>「你們老師呢？」</p>
<p>「老師跑了！」</p>
<p>「去築路了！」</p>
<p>直到這時，那路局的招待員才恍然大悟，為我們解釋着：</p>
<p>「哦，工程所到的地方，公家不但要收賣人民的田地，同時還要派附近的居民去做工，他們的老師大槪被　去做工了。」</p>
<p>「那　錢呢，有錢嗎？田地的錢和做工錢！」</p>
<p>「有是有，但還不知什麽時候才領到呢？」</p>
<p>那招待員意味深長的說。</p>
<h3 id="c245">憂鬱 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 捷克　Karel　Copek作</p>
<p>一會兒以前，你還在閒談和說笑話，任何事物都使你感覺興味和快樂。現在你却在凝視着地上；你願意你得禱吿一下，但為何而禱吿，對誰而禱吿，你可不知道。憂悒，疲倦，冷淡，你認為那是很奇怪，你幾分鐘前你會對任何事物感覺快樂，而更其奇怪的的明天起來去做你的事。而其中最為壞的，你的喉頭感覺緊閉，你似乎背上負了一個重担，你的眼睛是像鉛一樣，因此你不能把牠們抬起來離開地上。</p>
<p>什麽事你碰着了呢？沒有什麽，眞的沒有什麽。只不過一二件無關重要的不如意事吧了。比如一件東西阻碍我的路，但這是卑微不足道的——一件出乎我意料之外的事，一些少許傷害我的事，我不能把牠從我的心頭驅除開去，事實上，那是不算什麽，當你把這些事緊攏來；牠甚至不足夠當為一個可以憂愁的正當理由，就是把牠一五一十地加起來的話。那是不算什麽的，不過凑在一起，它就太多了一點——實際上牠還是不足道的，但你曉得生活是一個可怕的事物。</p>
<p>我很舌頭那一個日子，當所羅門五寫那一切悲觀者的信條約時候——那就是他寫「空虛的空虛，凡事都是他空虛」——那一個日子，沒有什麽特別的事，他曾碰着；他的王國沒有傾圮，他的寵妻沒有死，他也沒有感覺到在他的多病之身死的來臨。事實上那天所羅門王沒有碰見什麽事！不過也許他在他的寵妻的眼中體味出愚蠢與狡詐，在牠的朋友身上體味出冷淡，在他的侍役身上體味出卑鄙；或者有一件東西他遺失掉，那東西也許極不重要的；或者他的一件事業失敗，一件事使他失望；他看許多事件比平常要稍許暗淡無光些，那些人民也卑微而更其討厭些，生活也較困難些。這一切眞不算什麽，如果佻把它緊攏來看。可是所羅門王在那天却被這些不相干的事的重壓所打擊而戰憟了；厭倦得要死，他在他的書中寫下「萬事皆空」。</p>
<p>因為，你得注意，在命運深重打擊當前，是不能做一個英雄的。死亡，毀滅，船翻，據有些人說，能夠硬着頭皮遭受；在最後頭頭，一個人還能掙扎而後死滅。但一個人切不能在一根針尖面前做一個英雄。你實際上能夠滿不在乎被針戳兩次以上；而且還可以再勉强忍受這末幾次而不在乎；但當刺了十次或十五次，你的一切英雄氣槪就會溜走。人是對於小的痛苦一無辦法。他能在斷絕了一條腿的當兒感覺一種驕傲，可是在他碎了一片指甲，他感覺不到什麽驕傲。他能能夠忍受他的妻子死亡而漠然無動於中，但他不能英勇地忍受她那種笨頭笨腦的凡庸。他可以有某種遭逢災害的安慰，如果他的房屋是倒坍了，但他却沒有安慰，如果他的房屋是極其簡陋。</p>
<p>憂鬱，生活當中最嚴重愁苦，是一種由小原因而引起的痛苦。牠的所以嚴重，由於牠的不屈服於英雄行徑之前；世上沒有憂鬱的英勇的犧牲者。牠在任何情形之下，是一種柔弱無能，或者更確切地說，是一種當着小的不幸事件前面而毫無辦法的狀態。</p>
<p>我甚至要說現代差不多沒有悲劇。拿易卜生說：他的現代悲劇（甚至包括他的帬鬼在內）實際上都是憂鬱的喜劇；劇中英雄的悲劇，都由於他們是些可悲憫的人物，他們不可避免地走上不幸的道路，也就因為這樣，他們根本上帶可笑的成分。古典英雄反抗神的意旨，那是悲劇的，現代英雄反抗人間事物，那帶些喜劇性，但主要是悲慘的。莎氏比亞的英雄常是死亡，這樣的結局，可以使他們免去了不願意有的荒謬舉動。現代英雄大都是仍舊活下去，這樣一來，使他們旣可笑又可悲憫。如果奧塞羅不自殺，而被發覺他有可以减輕罪名的條件的殺人罪，並且還可以像一個退休的將軍一樣，支一半退俸金，度着老年生活，他就變為一個現代英雄——那就是說，一個憂鬱的打了一半折扣的英雄。那就是為什麽一個人他要寫一部眞正的悲劇必須在劇本的結局來一個大屠殺的原因。並不是死的自身是悲劇的與崇高的，而是這樣以後，你的英雄就不能再做一件事可以損毀他的英雄行徑了。</p>
<p>飽受痛苦是一件憂鬱的事。如果世界有所謂現代英雄主義這樣東西的，那末牠應該不是英雄的死，而是英雄的樂觀主義。但，現代戲劇一直還沒有達到這一境界。（絡緯譯）</p>
<h3 id="c246">揚子江夜潮 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 超軼</p>
<p>我緘默着，他也不作聲。</p>
<p>夜是黑的。我看不見他的臉和手，可是我仍舊看得淸他。比夜還黑的他的眼睛，張開在我身邊。</p>
<p>那是他的眼睛，靜止的時候淡漠而略帶鬱悶；此外便變幻不公平地閃着痛楚，憤怒，絕望，和决死戰的顏色。這黑色的深　，建着牢不可破的苦惱的世界；但是當你自己痛楚的時候，你可以看出它的痛楚比你還稅利，建陽地你便感到稍為减少了些寂寞，得到些溫熱。可是它本身不是不溫熱的，它祗把痛楚來溫熱你的痛楚；憤怒來拯救你的絕望。那時我正陷在萬分落漠的苦惱中，偶然我闖入了這個境界，我不知道，也許這正是我所夢想的，總之我留下了。我在裏面已經　得很外，却永遠沒有希望與它熟稔，也永遠無法認淸它眞正的顏色。在那裏面我時常感到咬痛的感覺，有時還嗅到血腥和死的氣味。但是我無法走開，這是一種病，固執地留在一個苦惱中間，成了我治不好的病。</p>
<p>我常常覺得這是沒有理由，為什麽闖進去擾亂這裏的世界呢？</p>
<p>張開在我身邊的眼，顯得與平常稍有不同一些。還是惱恨的，而且又是疲倦的，却仍帶着不安；這黑的世界看去更加大到沒有邊際，深到沒有底。忽然灼熱，忽然又凍住。包裹着我，使我與外面的世界完全隔絕。在那黑的深處，漸漸響出風和水的聲音，放射出草木的香味。我突然感到甜蜜的眩暈。我有點明白，這不過是一個幻象的世界，馬上便會湮滅。可是我還閉着眼抓住它，求它讓我多呼吸一點這種近乎死去的幸福。</p>
<p>風和水的聲音漸漸響起來，從糢糊得淸晰，從遠處漸漸走近。我弄不淸這是幻象還是眞實了。於是問他：</p>
<p>「什麽聲音？」</p>
<p>「潮水。」</p>
<p>是潮水，從遠處呼嘯着捲過來。我赤着脚跥下地，躡足跑去打開通露台的窗。露台正對着滔滔的大江，好使人看望遼遠的水和烟。窗一打開，風首先進來，接着便是　　的水聲。潮水像一條白的蛇，從遠處拖着疲倦和憤怒的步子邁過來，撞到岸上，便發出呯嗙的絕呌。</p>
<p>薄暗的天光下，一艘艘扯滿了帆的船，做夢般的在水面上滑過去。</p>
<p>我埋在風和水的聲音中間，埋在沉鬱的薄暗中間，埋在呯嗙的絕呌中間。我分不淸那裏是我，那裏是我以外世界。</p>
<p>「　　，來。」一個聲音喊着我。</p>
<p>大槪是那潮水的聲音。</p>
<p>「來！」隔一下又喊。</p>
<p>不是潮水，那雙黑眼睛望着我。</p>
<p>我們大家不作聲，靜靜地聽着風的呼嘯和水的衝擊。我明白潮水是恨這個陸地，要衝走它，呑沒它。</p>
<p>漸漸的，潮水，黑眼睛和我，都混到一個聲音裏去了。</p>
<p>天上慢慢的發着亮。</p>
<p>我老聽見那風和水的聲音，人家却不許我說。好，我不說：可是我還聽得見。</p>
<h3 id="c247">無産者之 <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3 id="c248">不說話的證人 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>「他是不說話的一個。」</p>
<p>徐嘉——我底很熟的朋友，這樣說。他給我丟下一捲報紙就走掉了。那是申報。我依從着他底指示，在「本市新聞」欄裏找到了那段記事：有一個年約四十左右的無名苦力男子，因患病無處棲宿，夜臥於法租界馬斯南路空地上工部局安放的水門汀瓦筒中，病重竟死在瓦筒裏，無人發覺，致屍體發胖腐爛，臭氧四溢……</p>
<p>像這樣明晰的社會容貌底描寫之一，在報紙上是很難得看見的。我把牠下來包裹一本小書擱在籐架上，但無意中竟發現那則新聞仍然光閃閃地呈現在我眼前。我沒有把牠摺在不呌牠外露的朝裏的一面。</p>
<p>那是一具被夏天的炎熱蒸得發胖了的腐臭的屍體，躱在瓦筒裏不發一言，牠底四週是光輝燦爛的陽光。關於牠的一切，牠拒絕吿訴我們。他曾經掙扎過來麽？他臨終的時候沒有什麽吩咐我們的麽？和他有關係的人們不曾知道他底遭遇麽？——誰也不能夠曉得。明天，這張舊報紙被放在廢紙堆裏，於是牠就被人們忘却，在沒有惋惜也沒有嗟嘆的平靜裏，和人類永遠斷絕了關係。事情是很簡單的。</p>
<p>但不簡單的地方得以安置在那樣的假定上。那假定卽是說一個人底出生和死亡，個人底生存在或消滅，緊緊地關聯着全人類底災禍，幸福，或進步，退落；從一個或若干個人底死亡消息上常常可以觀察人類底命運，推測牠底文化的正負里程和潰滅的時期。假如是這樣，我和我底朋友徐嘉底受感動是有所根據的。</p>
<p>在上海，對於這樣的事情不過跟路上看見一頭死鼠一樣，卽使驚呌走避，然而全無感動，我相信一部份人底反應是如此。從最初對一個卽令是活着的無名苦力也不過如此，或把他看成天生的奴隸，或把他看成下賤的同胞。</p>
<p>但有一部份人將會把這一具屍首看做人類底野蠻和羞辱的符號，以為牠是惡徒口中吐出來的骨渣，他們底兄弟被魔鬼呑嚥了之後的排洩物，測量自己的未來的命運的準星，因而永遠不會忘記牠，在一切談話和論證的時候提到牠——使牠經過若干世紀，比埃及的皇族的屍體更長壽地存在着。這也是完全可能的。</p>
<p>我以為並不是我們擯棄了他。試問我們之中誰有了擯棄別人底生存的勇氣呢？是他擯棄了我們。他比我們具有更强健的身體，更勇壯的氣力。做着更多的工作，然而他把我們拋離了。</p>
<p>這是我們底恥辱。牠證明了我們底自私，猶疑，和不能跟他協力。牠甚至證明了我們不過是比牠更低等，更需要姑息的存在。</p>
<p>「不說話的證人是最有力的。」我記起這句話起來了。</p>
<h3 id="c249">夜哨 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>

<p>高爾基在論劇一文里，說過這樣的話：</p>
<p>「藝術底基本使命，必須超拔於現實之上，從新人類底創造者——勞動階級所建樹的光輝的目的的底高處，來看今日的事業……英雄的事業，必須有英雄的語言。」</p>
<p>在另一個地方，他又說：</p>
<p>「對於現代的英雄——學者，發明家，建設者，Komsomol　Ploneer，詩人還沒有注意到，就是注意到了，也還是祗用無靈魂的語言把他們粉飾着。</p>
<p>高爾基常常在呌蘇聯的靑年作家，要寫出一個創造第二自然的新英雄的典型。</p>
<p>在現階段的中國，我們所要求於文學的，是什麽樣的新英雄的典型呢。我們的英雄，必須是秉有巨大的民族的靈魂，能對一切壓迫者作堅强不屈的反抗。——我們底英雄，必須是民族的堅强的性格。</p>
<p>近來讀了幾篇舒帬所作的小說，我看到這樣堅强的性格底表出。第一篇發表於文學里沒有祖國的孩子，果里和果里沙有同樣的堅强的性格的一面，一個顯出沒有祖國的堅忍，一個顯出對於一匹老鼠樣活着的人底賤視。然而果里終於把一把小刀放進魔鬼的胸中，在路上受了檢查，却又願意承認自己是高麗人而受縛，獻出了民族的壯烈的靈魂。接着，他又在文學界里發表了一篇沙漠中的火花，他也跟前篇一樣，寫出了一個堅忍的强硬的薩達爾圖，寫出了一個粗暴的强硬的阿虎太，他們種種誤解與容忍下，終於在出征蒙匪時，爆發了火花。而在蒙古之夜里，（見光明第一期）他又寫出了一個抗戰的靑年的堅强，與一個女人底沉着應變的堅毅。那女人直到死期，還奪了敵人底刺刀，顯示了不屈的反抗的精神。這從果里到薩達爾圖以至這蒙古女人，作者都付予他們一顆，堅忍，沉着，然而又極其勇敢的靈魂，阿虎太雖然暴躁了一點，但在他底戇直與英勇處，也一樣具有了中國大眾的可寳貴堅强的性格。</p>
<p>於是作者又把這堅强的性格，擴張到另一面去。在文學界第二期里的蕭苓，一個跳蚤似的活潑的女生，對於封建勢力的反抗，作者以非常活潑的筆調寫了出來。接着而來的「事變」，又使她成為一個積極反帝的分子。而有封建思想的溫和主義的張訓育員却在事變下盡了走狗的任務，在這塲合，兩個民族的性格的對照，是非常有意義的。在文學七月號里，作者在已死的與未死的一篇中，也寫出了跟蕭苓有同樣堅强的性格的李金，跟蒙古女人有同樣固執的李金的女人。——這女人，在丈夫被綁出「陪殺」的時候，她竟把刀子刺入自己胸頭死了。雖然她不能解脫舊思想的束縛；以生命去繼續丈夫的事業；但以她那樣壯烈的行為，去跟那些淫婦似地出賣民族的生命的漢奸比較她還是値得佩服。</p>
<p>總之，所有在舒帬筆下寫出的人物，性格都是非常堅强的，而這非常堅强的性格，却都在民族的整個危機下發露出來。却都統一在反帝的精神下顯露出來。這是否是作者有意這樣寫出的，我們可不知道。然而這是作者親身參加過東北義勇軍的抗戰的實踐中的感應，那是我們可以推想的。我們以為在中國這時候，文學上民族的堅强的性格底創造，將比一切都感重要。國防文學在這一點上，將有它光輝的基礎。</p>

<h3 id="c251">談談扦脚 <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>語云，「剃頭浴身小有趣」，其實剃頭浴身，並不甚麽有趣，而有趣的便是扦脚，因為生理的須要，和時勢的進展，扦脚之後而有刮脚，刮脚之後而有捏脚，花樣翻新，技巧百出，這種扦脚的歷史，若使請考據家頭頭是道，一一考究起來，不是可成一部偉大的着作麽？</p>
<p>近據某報載，我駐日大使許世英氏，在國內時，素有扦脚的習慣，赴日後，忽然脚，忽然脚指大癢，無法解决，鬧得日夜不安，適遇從上海去的某君，熟悉日本情形，就請他物色一扦脚匠，某君覓得日本理髪師一名，但手段不大高明，弄得許大使脚指皮破血流，懊喪不止。</p>
<p>扦脚原是一種小小藝術，本非容易的事，卽如我國素以善於扦脚着名，然而欲求眞正扦脚的好手，到也不易多得，並且理髪師是專做上層工作的，扦脚匠是專做下層工作的，其素習旣各有專門，而地位亦不相等，今許大使欲張冠李戴，使理髪師而去做扦脚工作，眞是「造屋去請箍桶匠」，宜乎其犧牲血本大拍賣也。</p>
<p>並且從人類平等的大原則上說，一個是睡在榻上寫意，一個是坐在傍邊扦脚，似乎違反人道主義太遠，其實世界上違反人道主義的事例正多，何止扦脚，所以現在政府發表明令禁止，使浴室中不准有此種絕無人道的行為，這原是對的，若照此種說法，許大使已不免有違反命令之嫌，但是從生財有道的原則言，這也的確是一種生財之道，假定要想主顧的法幣，情情願願從他們荷包袋裏掏出來，除剝猪羅玀之外，非用這種手段，是無法達到目的，故假定欲取消這種下層工作，若老實說句話，便是絕其生路。</p>
<p>因此我覺悟生財之道，祇有硬幹和軟騙兩種方法，剃頭所用的是刀，扦脚所用的也是刀，並且這種刀，是愈快愈好明明表示威嚇手段，一方面是用手來替他捏，捏得你骨酥神疲，無法抵抗，這是軟騙手段，威嚇和軟騙，二者並施，則主顧的金錢，自情自願迅速從皮夾中取出來了。</p>
<p>現在日本的對付中國，也多用扦脚手段，彼所謂外交一元化者，便是用軟硬兼施的方法，始而東三省，繼而東四省，又繼而冀東察北，現在更進一步欲將華北完全統制了，這樣扦脚式的政治手腕，一步一步的扦進來，令人安得而流，懊喪不止，這事如何了得呢。</p>
<h3 id="c252">雨 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 夏里斯</p>
<p>雨又瀟瀟地在下着了。</p>
<p>要是知道今年底夏天是多雨的，早就應該籌幾塊錢去買一件新的雨衣才好。那一天，楚子自南方來，特地上太古碼頭去迎他，半途竟遇着雨。豆大的水點打在電車窗的玻璃上，然後往下流，蜿蜒着，把街頭底一切都弄得迷糊了。車廂裏稀疏地沒有幾個人，是黃昏時候了，賣票人把車里底電燈開亮以後，就楞在一邊哼起京腔來。到達外灘的時候，雨下得更大了，沙沙地打着柏油馬路。我一點防雨的東西也沒有，在站臺上躊躇了一下，因為電車馬上又要開行了，只得跳下去，奔向碼頭那里去。</p>
<p>在碼頭那里等了約莫二十分鐘，飽看了黃浦江上底雨景，一點親情也沒有，我只感到異樣的悶鬱和煩惱。我在想：楚子將帶給我一點什麽呢？他是從故鄕來的，而我在外漂泊却足足八年了。</p>
<p>楚子底臉上浮起為友情所溫暖了的微笑；但是僕僕風塵，漂過南邊底海而來的，他終竟現出勞頓之色，而急於找一個安身的旅舍。看見我底全身差不多為雨打濕了，楚子一定感於我冒雨相迎的熱情吧，執着我底手一連道謝了幾聲。我連忙向他說着：</p>
<p>「為什麽忽然客氣起來了呢？難道是因為分別了三年的緣故麽：…剛才我出來的時候不過是烏陰天，是半途才遇了雨的哩。」</p>
<p>於是，楚子在赴旅舍的車上，淅瀝的雨聲里，帶來了故鄕多雨的消息。「家鄕今年眞是多雨呢，」他這樣也開始說了，「春天」有過七天繼續不停地下雨的時候。田裏插的秧全給浸壞了，田滕也給淹浸了，分不出界綫來。池塘裏底水溢到外面，放魚的三伯愴忙得飯也來不及吃。水災！啊，你相相水災之後的家鄕吧！」</p>
<p>家鄕是凄凉而且破碎了！楚子帶來的就是這些。夜裏我回來獨自臥在床上，熄了燈，外邊點雨聲更加地淸晰。一大串回憶浮現起來了，那是我和楚子都是還在童年的時候。春來時桃花芬芳地開放在原野，點綴着綠色一片的草坪。黃鶯兒歌唱着，啾啾的聲音一早就把我從睡夢中喚了醒來。田野是綠的，天空是明朗的，燕子在簷前呢喃，屋前洒滿了溫和的太陽光。每天，用一顆無憂慮的心在這南國底天野里生活着。不懂得人世底躱在屋簷下看池塘底蓮葉，扇面一般在打了開來，托着晶珠似的水點。到了夏天，荷花開了，引來了蜜蜂嗡嗡地在飛翔，也使我們孩子底心活躍起來。那時節的那樣地　暖與美麗，那樣地使人留戀…</p>
<p>家鄕底懷戀苦惱着我；瀟瀟的夜雨苦惱着我。</p>
<p>漂泊在都會裏邊，孤獨地彳亍於人生底旅途上，我是多麽缺少溫煦的陽光，而總是顚沛在雨天底泥潭裏啊。楚子是明瞭我，並且同情我的，他用一股可感謝的溫情撫慰過我，鼓勵過我。</p>
<p>而又是雨天了，多麽傷感的，灰色的雨天啊！</p>
<h3 id="c253">包車夫 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 費向東</p>
<p>我們家裏那包車夫走的時候，介紹了亞祥來，並且這樣地說道：「我因為年紀老了，拉車子恐怕不能够了，所以才向你才爺辭職。現在，我呌阿祥來拉老爺的車子；你相這傢伙；年靑而且力大，老爺一定喜歡他的！」</p>
<p>被呌着老爺的是我的父親。這時阿祥的衣衫穿得很襤褸，樣子很難看，你若是仔細地往他身上瞧瞧，那末，你可以看出他的臉上還有不太顯明的麻皮。身體到是很强健的，個子相當高，力氣是不成問題的。我父親問了他幾句簡單的話，比如上海街路熟悉不熟悉等等，然後就接受了他，並且馬上給了他二塊錢，呌他做兩套衣裳去。這使他感激得連忙道謝着，就退出去了。</p>
<p>第二天，他就開始拉了父親到寫字間去，吃中飯時又拉他回來。我們很優待他，呌他住在亭子間裏。父親是不善於交際的人；除了一天四趟出入以外，其餘難得到別的什麽地方去。我是不坐包車的，但是和阿祥却有時也得到接近的機會。那就是夜裏我們都留在家裏的時候，人們都把精神放到麻雀牌或是閑談中去，而我却愛在門邊站着，靜靜地相着一些事，看看天上的星星。亞祥也常常在那裏整理包車，有時還用水去洗着呢汚的車輪。發現我站在他的身邊時，他就很有禮貌地呌我做少爺，問我為什麽還不到房間裏去安息。起先我祇和他談到天氣很熱，或是車夫的生活過得怎麽樣這一些；雖然也是很苦的工作，不塓比起牛馬一樣的黃包車夫來，他不能不呌道：「我是幸福得多了。」</p>
<p>漸漸相熟起來以後，我們所說的話也更多。我知道亞祥。原本有一個很過得去的家，也有一個妻子。他們勤快地給地主耕田，也還可以謀一家的溫飽。然而近年的，天災人禍相逼而來，地主的租又逃不掉，不得已只好去借債。於是，除了種種農民逃不掉的剝削之外，亞祥又負了債，為利息所侵蝕着，一天一天地窘迫起來，幾乎不能生活下去了。後來，他把一家的担子放到他的哥哥身上去，獨自流浪到都會來。他現在每一個月的收入，大部份都得寄回家去。</p>
<p>「少爺，你們享慣了福的人，那裏想得到我們鄕下人的苦處呢？」他搖頭太息了一聲，結束了他的說話。</p>
<p>每一次家裏來了信，他都捧着給我看，要我把信裏的意思解釋給他聽。由於我的發問：「要不要寫一封回信去？」他就表示那裏敢勞我做這種了？不過我把他帶到父親的書房裏，打開信紙，呌他把要說的話說出來。</p>
<p>「少爺你吿訴她：我在這裏很平安。每個拿到錢就寄家。…問她孩子大了點沒有？要好好地照顧他們才好。還有李八爺那裏的債，我準定負責還淸，呌哥哥放心。…就這樣，沒有別的話說了。」</p>
<p>「眞的沒有話說了麽？」</p>
<p>「是產。我們鄕下人的話一句就算一句！」</p>
<p>亞祥的老實，忠厚，是顯然連父親也很喜歡他了。但是，我們之間總有什麽隔膜似地，每一次聽到他那顫動的聲音呌着我少爺，我都感到不安。而且，亞祥在都會裏混久之後也慢慢覺悟了，這種牛馬的生活和我們的安適是如何地不同。有一次我聽到他在和別人說了這樣的話：「我們也是人呵，為什麽別人可以坐包車，而我却必需拉車子呢？」一背轉臉來看見我在走過，他便立卽停住了。我沒有責備他，我簡直沒有別的話說：我走進門去，亞祥一定目送着我的吧。</p>
<p>這樣過了兩年，亞祥也向我門辭職了。他不是為了年老，而是要到一家工廠做工去。他沒有給我們介紹新的包車夫來，父親也不再坐包車了。</p>
<h3 id="c254">種西瓜的農人 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>種西瓜也是農村中的一種副業，而且有的地方，那些農人，竟不願種稻，祇種西瓜，為的是種西瓜，如果年成好，瓜賣得起錢，那獲利之多，為種稻麥所遠遠的及不上的；這原因，有很多地方的農人，是靠種西瓜活命的。</p>
<p>不過種西瓜，所下的肥料，比稻麥多，萬一收成不好，瓜賣不起錢，那虧起本來，也比種別的東西來得厲害；所以穩健的農人，是再不會多種西瓜的，就是種也不過沒有幾畝，當做一種附屬品而已。</p>
<p>西瓜是過了淸明下種的，畦子要挑得高，兩面做溝，這樣下了雨水，可以很暢快的排出去。據說種西瓜倒是乾燥的生地好，更有人說這一塊土地，今年種了西瓜，明年不能再種，至少要隔</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>十年。倘然在同一的田裏，今年種了明年再種，那瓜便會淡而無味。不過普通的農人，他種十畝西瓜，如果每年要種十畝，而種過了的田隔開十年再去種瓜，那他非得要有一百畝田才得輪流交替，事實上他那裏會有一百畝田呢？所以决不會隔了十年再種。至多間隔三五年而已。不過這一塊田裏，今年種了西瓜，明年種稻，那是很好的，所以有經騐的農人，都把瓜和稻間，交替種的。</p>
<p>種了西瓜之後，最重要的一部分工作，就在壓藤，因為西瓜藤長了就要一直綫的用泥　子壓住，否則這一顆和那一顆的藤交叉了就會結壞的或變種西瓜。在霉雨的時節，天氣如何，便可决定種西瓜者命運因為每天下雨或是水發，便會使瓜藤爛掉，瓜實不甜的。種西瓜的方法，也各有不同，山東人種瓜是有名的，他們每一顆西瓜上祗留一個，其餘是摘去的。至於近上海一帶的農民，那每顆要留二三個，所謂頭藤瓜，二藤瓜，末藤瓜，所以山東人種的西瓜，碩大無比，最重的一個有三四十斤呢！</p>
<p>農人種熟了西瓜之後，拿到市上來求售，在我們鄉下，那他就不能直接向吃戶兜售的，非得要經過地貨行的手不可。然而地貨行的一轉手，却要從中取什一之利，所以賣去十塊錢瓜，農人祗到手九塊，地貨行主的不勞而獲，祗使種瓜的農入多受一種剝削而已。</p>
<p>就上海說來，十六舖，新閘橋，老閘橋，也不是都有地貨行麼？所以種西瓜的人，把西瓜運到上海來，照例也要上地貨行的，由地貨再賣給大販子，小販子，或吃戶，中間地貨行當然也可取得什一之利，而且西瓜販子幾個轉手，都要賺錢的，農人的重重剝削，說來也够可憐了　加着近年來上海方面，淋淇淋，汽水充斥市塲，西瓜的售價，祗是不會高，祗使得種瓜的農人，辛苦了三月，結果是難能獲利而已。</p>
<h3 id="c255">迷香賊 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>—山行雜記之一</p>
<p>一九三五年的夏天，我們幾個年青的夥伴，鼓着勇氣，到贛北一帶深山荒野中去旅行。翻過了大龍山的獅子嶺，我們幾個夥伴，都感到非常地疲乏了，因為每個人的身上都揹着將近廿斤的乾糧袋，已經走過了半天廿餘里的路了。一根十餘斤的雙管獵槍，又不時地輪流地移到每個人的掮上，它是我們在這人煙稀少的深山中，防禦野獸和土盜的利器。</p>
<p>獅子嶺上沒有濃陰叢蓬的大樹，紅日吐着酷烈的火焰，籠罩整個的山嶺。更沒有路徑，也沒有風尖石子與野草亂生着，令人不敢拔足向前，彷彿那裏儘蜿蜒着毒辣的火舌蛇。我們其中的兩個友人都縐緊了眉毛，發起怨語來了；「早曉得山嶺上沒有樹躱陰，我們不該不在山谷中多休息一會兒的，更不應該走得那麽快！」</p>
<p>我們只好伸直了腰桿子，拔步向前了，把揹着的乾糧袋了掉了一個肩。抬起腦袋來，對面那聳入雲間的山峯，又擺在我們的眼前了。那上面瀰漫着白霧，冒着火熱的靑煙，空氣中彷彿飛揚着黃沙。大家都不禁打了一個寒噤，汗毛孔中冒出了一陣熱汗。</p>
<p>在這蜿蜓着數百里的大龍山中，是沒有人家的，我們要剩着太陽未落之前，趕到星子縣才有下宿的地方。獅子嶺離星子縣，大約有卅餘里的模樣，雖然，太陽吿訴我們時間還早。</p>
<p>下了獅子嶺，就是一條陰深的山谷，一股消凉的氣息鑽進了我們的心肺，大家都不禁神魂飛舞了。我們在澗邊坐下來，泉水緩緩地流着，「嚓嚓」有聲，澗中高低不平，泉水猛的冲上去，又突的流下來，敲在靑石板上的聲音，彷彿在替我們　着愉快的音樂。</p>
<p>大家都將乾糧袋中的麵包拿出來充氣，用手捧起泉水向口中灌着，那水淸凉得猶如冰。我們吃着，飲着，簡直忘記趕路了。</p>
<p>不知在什麽時候，在我們去路的山峯上下來了兩個人，待到這兩人將走近我們的身邊的時候，才被我們年靑的夥伴小王發覺了。他們都穿着一套黑布短掛袴，手上都提着一隻沉重的竹籃子。其中一個用着粗野的嗓子問我們；「喂，老表，（註）到南昌府，是走這條路嗎？」用手指了一指前面谷邊的一條小路。</p>
<p>我們吿訴他後，便揚長而去了。年靑的夥伴小王吃驚地說道；「唉，我赫死了！這兩個傢伙一定不是好人，你看，那一對凶橫的發尖的眼晴多麽可怕呵！」</p>
<p>可是，我們都沒有覺得，滿不介意的大家立起身來，把糧袋依舊放到肩上去，我們也預備趕我們的路了。這時太陽已偏了一點西。</p>
<p>一路上，我們年靑的夥伴小王，嘮嘮不休地溜着那兩個傢伙不是好人。</p>
<p>剛踏上高峯，猛的前面跑來了十幾個人，手中握着扁担的，拿着長矛的都有，一跑到我們的面前，就驚慌地問道；「幾位先生，看見兩個手中都提着竹籃子的人嗎？」</p>

<p>開篇「怨夫」（咪咪集剏刊號）</p>
<p>月朗星佈天未明。佳人房內等夫君。對銀燈緊把雙眉鎖。低頭不語暗呻吟。想昔年嬌養深閏內。閒來無事把詩吟。有時來了諸姊妹。編歌唱曲共彈琴。自從嫁到夫家裏。屈指光陰已三春。堂上翁姑都去世。操勞家務費精神。可恨良人終日昏昏睹。費錢失業誤青春。有時賭到深更後。有時連日未歸程。我是苦口常相勸。誰知良言逆耳怒生嗔。他是全不思年來經濟困。也不思樓頭嬌妻恨聲聲。奴是通宵不睡常等候。如坐針毡怨萬分。只落得錦被空舖無人睡。鴛鴦枕上冷淒清。月照紗窗形伴影。肺腑之言向誰云。獨坐無聊聲寂寞。一腔心事悶沉沉。青春夫婦如畫餅。三生石上誤簽名。嚓嘆紅顏多薄命。倒不如削髮入空門。那佳人此刻愁如海。錦鷄三唱已天明。忽聞丫鬟前來報。太夫人送禮在前廳。抬身起。步輕行。微飄俏目看分明。原來是萱堂送我無綫電。收音機消遺解愁悶。待我歸寗謝娘親。</p>

<p>這是開電影界未有的空前紀錄，藝華公司近因為開拍「廣陵潮」一片，特在公司內部闢了一片成衣鋪，並由外邊請進了三十多名裁縫匠，日夜不停地在趕製着「廣陵潮」中的服裝。</p>
<p>我們知道「廣陵潮」是一部描寫清朝末葉時代的官塲中人的腐敗，以及革命先進們的為爭取民族解放，不辭勞瘁視死如歸的大無畏的奮鬥精神，故事是悲壯熱烈的，情節又是驚泣鬼神的。</p>
<p>因為它的背景是在清朝，所以服裝等是非適合時代性不可了。因此藝華的服裝間，就宛如開了一個古裝展會，形形色色的，由現在的眼光視來，頗覺新奇的，各種各樣的服裝是一襲襲地效三十多名成衣匠的手裏完成着，結掛上衣櫥中去了，像這種呌裁縫匠到公司製服裝，的確是前所未有的創舉，而「廣陵潮」耗在服裝上面的金錢，至少是需要三千金哩。</p>

<h3 id="e12">Wang Yongbin Discusses Plans to Reform Prisons <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Establish six prisons nationwide, each accommodating 5,000 people. Wang Yongbin spoke to reporters on the 6th about the important work currently being carried out by the Ministry of Justice. It is said that since July 1 this year, the Ministry has been urging the high courts of each province to change the trial system to county judicial offices. All provinces are in the process of reforming, with Shandong, Hubei, and Gansu making the most effort. As of today, more than 500 county judicial offices have been established nationwide, accounting for one-third of the total number of counties nationwide. It is estimated that by the end of next year, the reform can be completely completed. After the implementation of the three-level, three-trial system, the second-instance courts urgently need to be increased. Now the Ministry of Law stipulates that every ten counties will have a high branch court, and has instructed the existing high courts to comply in order to facilitate people's appeals. There will be a major reform in prisons. The planned prisons are prisons directly under the Ministry of Law, and it is planned to establish six in important areas nationwide, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Pingjin, Guangzhou, and either Xijing or Luoyang. The scale is extremely grand, with each prison accommodating 5,000 people, specifically for criminals sentenced to more than three years in prison. The second is the intermediate prisons under the jurisdiction of the high courts and branch courts, where criminals sentenced to two to three years are sent for execution. As for the old prisons in the counties, most of them are corrupt and irreparable, and it is planned to replace them all with detention centers to detain defendants awaiting trial and criminals sentenced to short-term imprisonment of less than two years. The Ministry of Law believes that sending criminals sentenced to short-term imprisonment to prisons not only makes it difficult to see the effect of remorse and reform, but also poses the danger of spreading bad habits. Therefore, it has repeatedly instructed courts at all levels to reduce sentences of short-term imprisonment and to encourage bail. In this way, the general public will suffer less from imprisonment, and the prisons will not be overcrowded. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Good Neighbor Policy and Diplomatic Relations <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Recently, US President Roosevelt visited Canada and addressed the welcoming crowd in Quebec City, saying that the United States and Canada have lived in peace for more than a century. The two countries share a border of more than three thousand miles without defenses, and there have been no tragic bloodshed events in more than a hundred years. This is a good model for the warmongering world. He also said that the recently signed reciprocal trade agreement between the United States and Canada is clear evidence that the people of the two countries are implementing a "good neighbor policy." Although this is diplomatic rhetoric with much embellishment, the diplomatic relations between the United States and Canada can be called a glorious part of international relations history. The success of the good neighbor policy is not without factual basis, and there are reasons and effects worth mentioning.</p>
<p>There are two reasons why the United States can implement a "good neighbor policy" in Canada: the United States does not interfere in Canada's politics and actively cooperates in the economy. Political autonomy and economic cooperation are the two pillars of peace. How can the feelings between the two countries be harmonious without mutual respect? How can the relationship between the two countries be profound without mutual supply and demand? The United States has always advocated aggression against Latin American countries. It has either sent troops to suppress rebellions or arbitrarily abolished and established governments in Cuba and Nicaragua. However, the results have been resentment and the wasting of military expenses and manpower without any gain in politics or economy. On the other hand, the United States, aside from a few arrogant congressmen who occasionally called for annexing Canada, general responsible leaders did not harbor the intention of interfering in Canada's internal affairs. Therefore, the two countries can trust, rely on, and cooperate with each other. Once mutual trust is established and doubts are eliminated, even military preparations lose their effect.</p>
<p>Economic cooperation must have the conditions of political independence; otherwise, this cooperation is similar to the relationship between a colony and its mother country and cannot be said to be true cooperation between the two parties. It can only be called one-sided plunder. The United States actively promotes its economic imperialism in the Philippines and Central American countries, but the economic benefits it gains are not even one-tenth of what it gains in Canada. Why is this? Because taking cooperation as a method benefits both parties, and the benefits are great. Taking plunder as a means, even if there are gains, it is not permanent and is prone to backlash. Today's imperialist countries, such as Italy and Japan, exhaust their people and send troops far away to kill the people of other countries and annex their land, but the gains are not enough to compensate for their losses. Angell and others have already earnestly stated that aggression and war are of no use. Our eastern neighbor Japan and Italy in Europe are still pursuing military expansion and using sharp swords and giant ships as advertising techniques for selling their goods. It can be said that they are extremely unwise.</p>
<p>Japanese people repeatedly use "promoting friendly relations between China and Japan" as a cliché. We will earnestly tell the people of that country that the integrity of territory and the independence of sovereignty are the only basis for coexistence and co-prosperity. If that country can treat us like the United States treats Canada, then economic cooperation may be possible. If we are only treated as a continuation of Cuba, then there will be resistance under threat. How can there be good neighbors? How can there be co-prosperity?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In the case of Liu Ruiheng being accused of embezzling public funds, the Capital District Court has scheduled the second public hearing for the 11th. Regarding the part involving the Ministry of Health, a preliminary investigation hearing was specially held on the 6th, with Presiding Judge Gao Weijun presiding over the trial. Liu's defense lawyer, Di Kan, appeared in court to perform his duties. The presiding judge summoned witnesses one by one. Jin Tai, section chief of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Health, Zheng Hong, a staff member, and Chen Yuhua, the landlord of the staff dormitory of the Ministry of Health, testified. According to Jin Tai's testimony, No. 314, Molu Road, Nanjing, is the Ministry of Health's dormitory. Minister Liu and his wife currently live there, and Liu's brother-in-law, Wang, also lives there. Sometimes, foreign advisors to the Ministry of Health also live there when they come to Nanjing. The house is rented by the Ministry of Health for the purpose of providing accommodation for the Ministry of Health. According to Zheng Hong's testimony, as far as I know, Moling Road is the dormitory of the Ministry of Health, but Minister Liu and his wife and his brother-in-law all live there. Sometimes, foreign advisors to the Ministry of Health are entertained. The rent, electricity, and telephone bills for the Ministry of Health's dormitory have always been paid by the Ministry of Health. From January of the 21st year of the Republic of China to July of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, a total of 12,176.36 yuan has been paid. As for the matter of the words "Liu's Residence" on the September telephone bill of the 23rd year of the Republic of China being crossed out and changed to "Ministry of Health Dormitory", it is not known who crossed it out, or it may be because the minister lived there, so people mistakenly thought so. Later, according to the testimony of witness Chen Yuhua, the house was rented by the Ministry of Health in the 18th year of the Republic of China. The rent was formerly paid by the Ministry of Health, and after the change of ministry, it was paid by the Ministry of Health. As for whether the house is Minister Liu's residence or the Ministry of Health's dormitory, he claimed not to know. At this point, the presiding judge asked Zheng Hong when Liu Ruiheng could return to Nanjing. According to the testimony, he has not recently received a report on the minister's whereabouts, and the Secretariat of the Ministry of Health moved to Lushan last week to work. Whether the minister is in Lushan and when he will return to Nanjing is not known. The presiding judge then asked the defendant's lawyer, Di Kan, that in the past, you applied to check the accounts to show the credibility of the case. The court, together with the defendants, made a detailed calculation in the middle and lower ten days of last month. The result was that the total amount of the accounts was not different from that stated in the indictment. It seems that there is no need to invite an accountant to calculate together. If you make this application again, it will inevitably be rejected. As for the defendant Liu Ruiheng, he must be summoned to court during the next public hearing. Lawyer Di replied that he would immediately call Minister Liu and ask him to attend the court hearing. Regarding the calculation of the accounts, he also intends to solicit his opinion. At this point, the court ordered that the second public hearing of the case be scheduled for the 11th in the Criminal Court of this court. Witnesses should wait to be summoned to court. The court adjourned at 12 o'clock. (6th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In the case of Liu Ruiheng embezzling public funds, the Capital District Court continued to hear the part involving the staff dormitory of the Ministry of Health on Gonghoushan Mountain on the 6th. Because Liu Ruiheng was in Lushan and had not returned, he had ordered the defense lawyer Di Kan to urge Liu to come to Nanjing to surrender himself for questioning. (6th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Flying Flower Industry Association sent Xie Zhongle and Bao Guoliang as representatives to Nanjing to petition. Xie and others arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 6th. According to them, the Ministry of Finance ordered the Jianghai Customs to prohibit the export of waste wadding, mistakenly prohibiting the export of flying flowers as well. The industry was greatly panicked because waste wadding is commonly known as banana flower wadding, also known as broken wadding, which is taken out from banana cotton and worn-out cotton quilts. Flying flowers are various kinds of flying flower scraps produced by spinning mills, which are a major export of our country with considerable annual sales. After the ban, the industry will inevitably be greatly affected, so a meeting was held to decide to send us to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting that the export of flying flowers be exempted from the same prohibition. After arriving in Nanjing, we have petitioned the Ministry of Finance, and the result is good. We will then petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for relief. (6th Dispatch)</p>

According to the institute's recent trial, the larger machine can thresh one dou of wheat per minute, and about sixty shi of wheat per day, using only three cans of kerosene. The wheat grains produced have very few impurities, and the results are excellent. Moreover, in addition to threshing wheat, the machine can also thresh beans, sorghum, and millet, etc. The institute plans to build five or six more units within the year for trial use in Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces next year to facilitate promotion.

On the same day, Mr. Bayart received a reply from the Soviet government. The Soviet government agreed to the principle of non-interference in Spanish internal affairs and is prepared to participate in the non-interference agreement.

<p>(Rome) Regarding the French proposal for relevant countries to conclude an agreement on non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, it is reported that the Italian government will also submit a reply soon, expressing its acceptance in principle. Government officials stated that the Spanish situation has become an international issue because the Third International is now engaging in insidious activities around the world, inciting unrest, not only in Spain but also in Greece, Czechoslovakia, Argentina, and other countries. Therefore, the position adopted by the Soviet Union deserves special attention. In general, the Italian reply will divide the policy of non-interference and the policy of neutrality into two because the Spanish incident has now developed into a genuine civil war and is not a simple rebellion. Therefore, the solution should be based on the provisions of international law regarding neutral countries. During the American Civil War, Britain and France recognized both the North and the South as belligerent groups and immediately declared neutrality. There is a precedent. The Spanish situation is the same. All countries should adopt a neutral attitude. (According to the principle of non-interference, countries should not assist the rebels, but they can provide assistance to the legitimate government.) (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The international situation is becoming increasingly complex. Therefore, Lord Halifax, the Minister of the Crown who is acting as the British Foreign Secretary, has ended his vacation and returned to London today. In the afternoon, he met with various officials to discuss the temporarily suspended negotiations between Britain and Egypt, as well as the overall situation in Spain and the shocking developments in Greece, where Prime Minister Metaxas has established a dictatorship. Developments on the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War are progressing rapidly and seem to be going smoothly. Those responsible believe that there will be no obstacles from Russia and Portugal. However, everyone is anxiously awaiting the Italian government's response to the French note. However, all parties are currently acting in good faith, so it is expected that a compromise can be reached soon. The French government will inform the British government of the results of its inquiries with other capitals at any time. The British government's response to the French note has been welcomed by all newspapers. It is reported that the note clearly stated that the French government is deeply concerned about the consequences that will be caused by foreign support for any side in the Spanish war. The British government also shares this concern. The British government welcomes the immediate establishment of a compromise to save this danger, and does not oppose the major powers most closely related to this issue jointly declaring that they will first secretly prevent the shipment of arms and ammunition from their territories to Spain before engaging in negotiating a general agreement on this issue. All actions of the British government adhere to the principle of non-interference. Therefore, if other governments are prepared to make this statement, the British government is very willing to join.

<p>Two Italian planes, which were forced to land in Woran and Lamoroa in Spanish Morocco last week, were thoroughly investigated by French authorities. It was found that they had taken off before July 20th, belonging to the Italian Air Force. It was also discovered that a total of five planes departed at the same time. Due to the hurried preparations, the traces on the planes could not be completely erased, and the pilots did not have time to conceal their real names. The planes were piloted by civilian pilots and air force personnel. Documents found on one of the deceased revealed his real name. The maps carried by the two planes were all made in Italy. The destination of the planes was Mirira and Xiuta. Two planes have now fallen into the hands of the Spanish rebel army. It is now known that after one plane crashed in Woran, a Spanish plane flew above the Italian plane and dropped a package containing the uniforms of Spanish foreign legionnaires and a note written in Italian, which read, "Put on these uniforms and tell the French authorities that you are stationed in Nador as foreign legionnaires. We will send technicians and two barrels of oil to help you take off again. Do not enter the lion's den."

<p>(Moscow) "Krasnaya Zvezda" commented on the Spanish incident, saying, "On July 23rd, the government forces occupied Xilagadala Ma and Xiaerbasaituo in the southeast, which is a turning point in the position of the Spanish government. Madrid was thus able to connect with the seaport and food supply. The war was mainly participated by workers and militias. In the workers' struggle, the National Confederation of Labor of Anarchist Trade Unions also occupied a very important position. Until the outbreak of the rebellion, they were still slacking off on the United Front of the working class, but after the outbreak of the rebellion, they not only urged workers to participate in the anti-fascist war, but also announced their support for the government. Anarchist trade unionists adhered to the principle of 'not asking about politics.' This may be the first time in Spanish history that they have announced their support for the government. Not only in Madrid, but also in Barcelona, anarchist trade unionists closely cooperated with the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, and also participated in the workers' committee with the latter, cooperating with the government through this committee. Therefore, the rebellion of the warlord Fascist Party has become a huge driving force for the unity of all factions of the proletariat. Young people across the country have rushed to serve the government. Not only Catalonia, but even Baskonia, which has always been a stronghold of royalists and counter-revolutionary priests, is also leaning towards the government. Farmers who stood by in the October 1934 rebellion are now also rising up to participate in the war.</p>
<p>"General Franco of the rebel army, in order to obtain military assistance from Germany and Italy, is willing to give Minoerga Island to Italy and the port of Mahan on the island to Germany, in order to prevent French troops from being transported from Africa to France. Obviously, this action by the Spanish counter-revolutionaries endangers the interests of Britain and France. Franco gave Kota Fortress in northern Morocco to Italy, which is directly opposite the Strait of Gibraltar in Britain. Giving Kota to Italy will make Gibraltar no longer the western gateway to the British Mediterranean. Therefore, if this plan is realized, Britain will lose its control over the Mediterranean and the shortest sea route between Asia and Australia. Of course, the interference of Italy and Germany in Spain will inevitably cause panic in Britain and France. The Spanish civil war is increasingly developing into an international conflict. The outcome of the struggle between Spanish democracy and fascism will largely depend on whether peace or war will prevail in the near future." (Tass dispatch, 5th)</p>

According to a Spanish rebel officer there, 3,000 soldiers have now been transferred from Spanish Morocco to the interior of Western Arabia. The troops were divided into two merchant ships and one gunboat, including regular troops, foreign legionnaires, and Moroccan soldiers. The three ships also carried 200 machine guns, thousands of grenades, and many heavy vehicles.

<p>Madrid A reporter from this newspaper recently learned about the war situation in various regions as follows: (1) A team of government troops on the northern route, under the command of Captain Bulilo, launched an attack on Gordu Ba Province, has arrived between the Gelangya River and Navasailada, and built fortifications there. (2) The rebel army on the front line of the Somo Mountain Pass north of the capital once attacked Qiasige Village yesterday afternoon, but failed. They attacked again today. After the government troops in the village fought bravely, they finally repelled the rebel army, killing 16 enemies, injuring 30, and capturing many. When the rebel army attacked, they encountered an armored vehicle belonging to the government troops, immediately surrounded it, and planned to break through the armor, hoping to kill the government soldiers in the vehicle. However, the government soldiers in the vehicle refused to be captured and immediately fired out through the small holes next to the vehicle, killing a rebel captain on the spot, as well as the Fascist leader of Qiasige Village, Fu Nieer. When the government reinforcements arrived, they dispersed the rebel army, and all the soldiers in the vehicle were able to escape safely. (3) Although the government troops north of the Leong Mountain Pass have not completely controlled Saint Raphael Village, they have been able to prevent the rebel army from advancing south to attack the Guadarama Mountains. The government troops have also attacked the village of Saisididia twice, and the rear reinforcements have also arrived in the village to strengthen their position. Currently, the rebel army is erecting cannons on the high ground of the Leong Mountain Pass to bombard the government troops' positions, and at the same time sending planes to strafe the government troops' headquarters with machine guns in an attempt to resist stubbornly. The government troops there are now dividing their troops to advance towards the Yamada Mountains. The roads are rugged and the march is quite slow, but their morale is very high, believing that they will definitely win. As for the supply of food to the residents of the capital, it has been handled in accordance with the precedents of the European War. The food that each militiaman can receive per day has also been stipulated as follows: 630 centimeters of bread, 20 centimeters of vegetables, 60 centimeters of fat, 20 centimeters of coffee, 50 centimeters of white sugar, 250 centimeters of meat or pork intestines, 200 centimeters of rice, or 500 centimeters of sweet potatoes (which can be exchanged for 100 centimeters of vegetables), and 2.5 liters of wine.

<p>Barcelona A special dispatch from our reporter: The war situation today, especially on the Aragon Province front, has seen great progress for the government forces. The various news items are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The rebel army's "Black Team" of 9,500 men recently emerged from the city of Zaragoza and was defeated by the regular army and militias belonging to the government near Quindo Village. Countless military supplies and bullets were seized, and many soldiers of the team were captured.</p>
<p>(2) The government army defeated the fascist party army and the restoration party members in Teidiontuo Village (southeast of Zaragoza City) yesterday.</p>
<p>(3) Colonel Santi Wo, commander of the Catalonia Air Force, reported that the government army on the Aragon Province front surrounded a column of rebel army in Sarnaina City (near Huesca City) yesterday and captured 2,000 people. These people immediately turned against the rebels and joined the government army. The government army has now advanced 15 kilometers towards Zaragoza City.</p>
<p>Except for the Xu Aragon Province, there has been no significant change on other fronts, especially in the area of the Zhua Dalama Mountains north of the capital, where the two armies are still guarding their original positions. As for the Gibushiguya Province in the northwest, the war has been quiet for many days, and it is said that it has now resumed, but neither side has made any progress. It is also said that Navarre Province has entered a state of terror. Wherever the rebel army's power reaches, the residents are in danger of their lives at any time. Especially in Yega City, many members of the People's Front have been brutally executed by shooting. In addition, news came from Burgos City, the seat of the rebel pseudo-government, claiming that Prince Asturias, the third son of the deposed King Alfonso XIII, recently joined the rebel army, but the "National Defense Military Government" refused to recruit him. The prince has returned to France in disappointment. Political figures here criticized this move, saying that it shows that General Mula, the rebel commander on the northern route, is not aiming to carry out a restoration, but to create a personal military dictatorship.

Foreign Minister Basiya recently told our reporter in detail about the war situation there, saying that because Sastigo City is important, the rebel army specially dispatched two columns from Zaragoza City to the city, attempting to occupy it.

As a result of the battle, the government army won, capturing 1,300 rebel soldiers and seizing 20 machine guns and 15 cannons. The second column encountered the government army near Pina City and also retreated after being defeated, with 70 people being captured and 3 cannons and countless ammunition being abandoned. Afterwards, three officers and forty-five soldiers of the rebel army were killed. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

According to the government's announcement that government troops captured the rebel stronghold of Sangrafaer in the Zhua Dalama area, the army immediately intercepted a wireless telegram from the rebel headquarters in Burgos, ordering the rebel army on the Liang Plateau not to hesitate to sacrifice to capture Zhua Dalama Village in order to open the road to Madrid, and ordering them to quickly capture the Zhaoya Reservoir north of the capital, which Madrid relies on for its water source. Today, the rebel army used cavalry for mountain warfare for the first time, but the terrain was unfavorable, and the cavalry team was driven away by the government army's rifles and machine guns. The rebel army claimed that the former royalists in Panpoluna in northeastern Spain had formed a column of 12,000 men and were heading towards Madrid. It also claimed that they had seized 15 trucks full of soldiers and ammunition in Zaragoza, and annihilated a team of government soldiers in Granada, consisting of 250 militiamen loyal to the government. Three cannons, four machine guns, trucks, and ordinary vehicles were all owned by the revolutionary army. The government side claimed that the government army advancing from Barcelona towards Zaragoza surrounded a column of rebel army in Salinina, 35 miles from the city, and captured 2,000 people.

<p>Guadarama Rebel Front When Mr. Picard, a reporter for the Associated Press, arrived in Rafir today, the government army was attacking the city. Mr. Picard was detained by the rebel army for four hours. He was released only when the battle ended. According to Mr. Picard's report, the government army suddenly attacked from both wings, intending to encircle the entire Zhua Dalama area. The government troops were all left-wing youths, wearing blue workers' uniforms. They rushed down from Mount Soma. The rebel side was a formal infantry and artillery army, backed by well-trained fascist soldiers, who swept the government army like mowing grass and were all repelled. However, the government army had planes dropping hundred-pound bombs in the air, so the rebel army also suffered heavy losses. The residents of the city all came out in their pajamas to help the fascist army defend the city, using bedding as sandbags or climbing up chimneys to shoot at the enemy. Although the battle has not been decided, the rebel leader told Mr. Picard that Madrid could be occupied this week. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<p>Northern Route Rebel Headquarters Colonel Alanda, commander of the rebel army in Oviedo, is now surrounded by government troops. Today, he sent a telegram without money to General Mula and General Franco, the commanders-in-chief of the rebel army, asking for help, saying that if he cannot get help immediately, he will not be able to resist any longer. General Mula replied that a large team of rebel army has attacked the northern route to relieve the siege of Oviedo. General Franco telegraphed an order to stand firm. Judging from the fragmentary news obtained here, the position of the rebel army in Oviedo is very critical, and their food is running out. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Madrid The Ministry of Military Affairs announced today that the government army is now attacking Kodubai with aircraft and heavy artillery. The city is in danger of falling at any time. Furthermore, a team of rebel army went to Oviedo to lift the siege there, but it has been dispersed by the government army. At the same time, the vanguard of the government army in Sulia Province has also defeated the rebel army and is now preparing to advance towards Zaragoza. (National Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Recent Political Developments in Japan: The Current Cabinet Encounters Reefs; Fate to be Decided Between September and October; The Minsei Party Advocates Formulating a Policy Towards China <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recent political developments in Japan are making the reefs of the Hirota Cabinet more and more obvious. It is generally believed that the decision of its fate will be made between September and October. In the general budget for the next fiscal year, the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of the Army requested expenditures of more than 1.5 billion yuan, bringing the total budget to 3 billion yuan. However, the financial authorities estimate that they can only obtain a maximum income of 2.7 billion yuan. Therefore, how to find a way to balance income and expenditure is the biggest problem facing the Hirota Cabinet. Whether its life can be extended depends on this. The military also requested that all the army's demands should be funded by issuing new public bonds, and that all national income and increased tax revenue should be used to improve people's livelihoods. However, the financial authorities believe that, given the current economic situation, it is absolutely impossible to issue public bonds indiscriminately. At most, only 100 million yuan can be issued in the coming fiscal year. This is the main point of disagreement within the cabinet. There are also many disputes among the cabinet members regarding national policies. The Ministry of Communications' national electricity industry state-owned enterprise plan is supported by the military, but the Ministry of Education is strongly opposed to it. Private electricity business owners have attacked it even more fiercely. Minister of Education Ping Sheng Pa Sanlang has publicly stated that the electricity state-owned enterprise plan contains elements of state capitalism and yesterday urged Hirota not to adopt it. However, if this plan is rejected, the ministers involved will inevitably resign, and a great upheaval will be unavoidable. At the same time, the proposal to extend compulsory public education is also attracting a lot of attention. If it cannot be passed, the Minister of Education will probably submit his resignation. In short, the cabinet crisis will be difficult to avoid when the National Policy Discussion Council resumes its meetings. Recently, there have been demands in various quarters in Japan that foreign policy should be determined first, and then defense policy. In addition, the Seiyukai and the Minsei Party have repeatedly stated that the cabinet should carefully decide on its foreign policy first so that it can serve as a compass for defense policy. This proposition is becoming more and more powerful. The statement of the Minsei Party is worth noting. The party firmly believes that the government should carefully examine the actual internal and external situation of China, and formulate a strong and effective policy towards China based on realistic considerations, so as to build the necessary fundamental relationship between the two countries and fulfill the common mission of maintaining peace in the Far East. It also urged the government to strive to implement its policy towards China in accordance with the principle of co-existence and co-prosperity that it has always advocated. The Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun has always advocated an active policy. Today's editorial also advised the government not to expand its military too hastily, so as not to make Soviet Russia feel uneasy, and advocated that Japan should first determine its foreign policy so as to avoid unnecessary arms competition. This kind of opinion has recently become more and more popular and will probably attract great attention. (Central News Agency dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Minister of War Terauchi Juichi feels deeply displeased with Prime Minister Hirota's slow progress in fulfilling his promise of reforming the government. He is determined to use personnel changes as an opportunity to spur the government to vigorously implement reform policies. These include national policies regarding national defense, aviation, raw materials, fuel, steel production, and public health, all of which should be thoroughly implemented to strengthen broad national defense. If Prime Minister Hirota ignores these demands, Terauchi will resign, according to a Hualian telegram dated the 6th.</p>

<p>(London) A London correspondent for the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun recently revealed that British First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare is involved in the Anglo-Japanese compromise plan. Responsible parties in London are discussing this rumor with extreme caution, pointing out that Sir Hoare's current position makes it unlikely that he would actively promote such an initiative. Although British opinion is as described above, some Japanese share the desire to improve Anglo-Japanese relations. However, the British are well aware of the many difficulties ahead, especially the power of Japanese extremists, as exemplified by smuggling in North China and the abuse of British Indian Mr. Hu Xin by "Manchukuo" police authorities. Currently, London is not considering recognizing "Manchukuo," as this matter should be decided by the League of Nations. There has also been no discussion regarding the possibility of Anglo-Russian naval talks to extend the principles of the London Naval Treaty to the Far East. According to various Soviet circles, political relations between the two countries must first be improved before such negotiations can begin, according to a Reuters telegram dated the 6th.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Pacific Aviation: Plans to Extend from the Philippines to the Chinese Coast; Preparing to Negotiate with Chinese Authorities <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Reports from Guangzhou claim that Pacific Aviation will extend its service from Manila to Macau on September 1st. American airline officials stated today that this information is incorrect, according to a Guomin telegram dated the 4th.</p>
<p>(Washington) Since opening the Pacific air route, American Airlines now hopes to finalize landing locations with Chinese authorities in early autumn, extending the air route from Manila to the Chinese coast, a distance of approximately 700 miles. Connecting this segment will not only complete the Pacific air route but also link global air routes. American Airlines previously negotiated with the Chinese, British, and Portuguese authorities to select a terminal station for the Pacific air route from Guangzhou, Hong Kong, or Macau. However, due to Japanese interference in China and the unwillingness of the British and Portuguese to grant rights to American businesses, negotiations failed and the matter has been shelved until now. It is recently rumored that China may agree to allow American Airlines to establish an airport on a certain section of the coast, indicating that the previous difficulties may soon be resolved, and global flights are imminent. In the future, mail and packages can circle the globe in sixteen and a half days. If passenger service is implemented, the 60 days, 13 hours, and 28 minutes it took to set the world travel record 35 years ago can now be reduced to one-tenth of that time. The speed of progress is astonishing. The global flight routes are listed below:</p>
<p>New York to Frankfurt, Germany: 3,200 miles, 2 days (German company)</p>
<p>Frankfurt to Amsterdam, Netherlands: 225 miles, half a day (German company)</p>
<p>Amsterdam to Penang: 7,625 miles, 5 days (Dutch company)</p>
<p>Penang to Hong Kong: 1,650 miles, 1 day (British company)</p>
<p>Hong Kong to Manila: 700 miles, 2 days (currently by mail ship)</p>
<p>Manila to New York: 2,190 miles, 6 days (American company) Total: 24,560 miles, 16 and a half days, according to a Guomin telegram dated the 5th.</p>

<p>Istanbul, Turkey. Regarding the new convention on the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, which was previously signed at the Montreux Convention and subsequently approved by the Turkish Parliament, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has notified the diplomatic representatives of all countries that this new convention will provisionally come into effect on the 5th of this month. It also stipulates the following facilities and measures along the coasts of the two straits:</p>
<p>(1) Radio stations and navigation beacons will be established at Seddulbahir in the Dardanelles Strait and Büyükliman in the Bosphorus Strait. Warships of all countries passing through the straits in accordance with Articles 10 and 14 of the new convention may communicate with these stations;</p>
<p>(2) Saluting battery emplacements will be established at Kumkale in the Dardanelles Strait and Anadolu Kavağı in the Bosphorus Strait;</p>
<p>(3) Pilot stations will be established at Mehmetçik and Saribayir in the Dardanelles Strait and Büyükliman and Haydarpaşa in the Bosphorus Strait;</p>
<p>(4) Commercial land aircraft of all countries may fly over the straits along the Midye to Enez line. Seaplanes may also fly over the Erikli area when necessary. The government will soon issue a notification to all countries regarding prohibited flight zones;</p>
<p>(5) When foreign warships and auxiliary vessels pass through the straits, the captains of these ships shall notify the stations on both sides of the entrance to the straits of the ship's name by radio, and hoist the flag representing the ship's name on the mast;</p>
<p>(6) Any warships that have suffered damage while passing through the straits shall immediately notify the nature and extent of the damage and repairs by radio, and shall comply with the orders issued by the stations at the entrance to the straits, according to a Havas dispatch dated the 5th.</p>

<p>Athens. The generals of the nation telegraphed Premier Metaxas today, congratulating him on implementing dictatorial politics to cope with the Red Peril, saying that the national army pledged to support the government to maintain tranquility, according to a Guomin telegram dated the 5th. The martial law decree issued yesterday and the order to dissolve parliament have been posted throughout the city. Newspapers were not published today. The middle class generally expressed sympathy for the government's actions but feared that the communists might incite civil unrest.</p>
<p>(London) The newspapers are paying close attention to the situation in Greece, saying that this matter is completely unrelated to the Spanish Civil War. The Daily Telegraph reports, "The stringent measures taken by Greek Premier Metaxas are being carried out under the orders of the King, and the army and navy are both under government control. This is completely different from the situation in Spain. It is also difficult to believe that the Communist Party has great power in Greek politics. Since the accession of George II, the political situation has been unstable, and the King has made many efforts to stabilize the democratic system. Unfortunately, the anti-democratic faction has made a comeback, causing the King's efforts to end in failure." The Morning Post reports, "The people of the United Kingdom all hope that Greece will quickly return to tranquility, because Greece has always been an allied nation of the United Kingdom, and its strategically important position in the Mediterranean is of utmost importance. Therefore, from the British perspective, maintaining the stability of the political situation in Greece is beneficial," according to a Havas dispatch dated the 6th.</p>

<p>— Reporter of this newspaper, Hu Zhongchi, Hu Yizang</p>
<p>By this time, it was already too late to visit another news kingdom—Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. We didn't go until 3 p.m. the next afternoon.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun's building is a seven-story building in a modern retro style. Inside, we were received by Kami Numa Kenkichi, a reporter from the East Asia News Agency, and visited for two hours. The editorial office and block making room are on the second floor, the conference room, guest room, Japanese room, photography workshop, and English Mainichi editorial office are on the third floor, the Osaka Mainichi Charity Association office and braille Mainichi editorial office are on the fourth floor, the sales office, delivery area, and two stereotype printing workshops are downstairs, and the electrical room, machine room, paper storage, bathroom, and public dining room are in the basement. The meteorological observatory and pigeon house are on the roof. The mechanical equipment in the main departments, in our opinion, is largely the same as that of Asahi. Telephoto cameras and vacuum transport machines are all equipped there. There are a total of 23 printing presses, some of the fastest of which can print 180,000 newspapers per hour. Dedicated long-distance telephone lines connect to Tokyo in the east and Fukuoka in the west, which is said to be the first such installation created by Osaka Mainichi.</p>
<p>During the visit, we asked Mr. Kami Numa about everything. From his conversation, we not only understood the organizational system of Osaka Mainichi (note), but also learned the general outline of its past history and the various characteristics it possesses.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun is the successor to the "Osaka Daily News," which was founded in the Meiji 9th year (1886). The "Osaka Daily News" was renamed "Constitutional Political Party News" after six years, and then renamed "Osaka Daily News" in the Meiji 21st year (1898). In the Meiji 44th year (1911), it merged with the Tokyo "Mainichi Telegraph" and was renamed "Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun" as a branch of the "Osaka Mainichi Shimbun." As a result, the Osaka Mainichi became very powerful. It kept pace with the Osaka Asahi at the forefront of the Japanese news business.</p>
<p>In the Taisho 11th year (1922), the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun Company founded two special newspapers, the English Mainichi and Braille News. The English Mainichi is the only English-language daily newspaper run by Japanese people in the country, and the famous scholar Dr. Nitobe Inazo is the editor-in-chief. Braille News is a weekly newspaper dedicated to the blind. The entire copy is 16 pages long. The text is made up of raised dots on thick paper that unfortunate blind people can touch and read. The current editor-in-chief is Nakamura Kyota, a blind scholar who graduated from Cambridge University in England.</p>
<p>The astonishing development of the Mainichi Kingdom in recent years is largely due to the former president, Motoyama Hikoichi. He once said a famous sentence: "The authority of the newspaper is directly proportional to the personality of the reporter."</p>
<p>Osaka Mainichi, like Osaka Asahi, also claims that it starts from the centrism of the imperial family and takes a fair and stable attitude towards any problem. It hired a "highly respected" senior veteran of the Japanese news industry, Tokutomi Soho (real name Inoichiro) as a front for the newspaper. In addition to writing occasional essays and current affairs commentaries for the evening editions of Daimai and Tonichi, this old man also continuously published his life's great work "History of the Japanese Nation" in the morning editions of Daimai and Tonichi. He received particularly favorable treatment in this newspaper. His title was a company guest, and his annual salary was 30,000 yen. Such a title and such a huge salary are rare in the Japanese news industry.</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun Company has now abolished the title of president. The highest responsible person is Board Chairman and Doctor of Law, Oka Minoru. The chief writer is Takaishi Shingo. The total number of employees in the company, including Tokyo Nichi-Nichi, is more than 3,360, which is more than Asahi (the number of employees in Asahi is 3,300).</p>
<p>The total circulation of Osaka Mainichi and its affiliated Tokyo Nichi-Nichi has exceeded two million. However, compared to the Osaka and Tokyo Asahi, the circulation seems to be a little lower. These two news kingdoms are now using all their strength to compete for supremacy. Recently, Osaka Mainichi opened a grand exposition in Koshien with a capital of one million yen, mainly for the purpose of propaganda. Following this, Osaka Asahi held a Kansai gymnastics competition, also for the same purpose. Osaka Asahi has established magnificent Asahi Halls in major cities to connect the feelings of the reader community, while Osaka Mainichi has Japan's only sound film photography car, collecting news films from various places and renting them to all public institutions for screening, to promote the momentum of "Mainichi" from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Based on superficial observations, we can roughly compare these two kingdoms, Mainichi and Asahi: Asahi seems to be younger than Mainichi, and Mainichi seems to be more mature than Asahi. The youthful spirit and the mature spirit each have their own advantages.</p>

The 2nd Submarine Squadron, 1st Destroyer Flotilla, and 7th and 8th Squadrons anchored between Hulishan Fort, Dianyuwei Fort, and Dadeng Lighthouse. The fleet anchored 10 miles outside the port, between Qingyu and Jinmen.</p>
<p>Main Fleet Officers: (1) Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet and Commander-in-Chief of the 1st Fleet, Admiral Sankichi Takahashi; (2) Commander-in-Chief of the 2nd Fleet, Vice Admiral Viscount Takayoshi Katō; (3) Commander of the 3rd Squadron, Vice Admiral Keitarō Hara; (4) Chief of Staff of the Combined Fleet and Chief of Staff of the 1st Fleet, Rear Admiral Naokuni Nomura. Commanders of the other squadrons are all Rear Admiral rank, not listed.</p>
<p>After the arrival of the Japanese main fleet in Xiamen, at 11:00 AM, the Japanese Navy dispatched the destroyer Wakaba to Xiamen to welcome Mayor Shilin Li, Xiamen Fortress Commander Guogeng Lin, City Government Advisor Hongsheng Chen, Japanese Military Attaché Suga, Japanese Consul Ryōtarō Yamada, important merchants and gentry of Japanese and Taiwanese descent, etc., to the flagship Nagato. Li Shilin immediately represented the provincial government in hosting the fleet, and visited Takahashi together with Lin Guogeng, and also visited Katō on the Myōkō. At 12:00 PM, Takahashi hosted a banquet for Li Lin and the Japanese Consul, etc., on the Nagato. All important generals attended the banquet. During the banquet, Takahashi delivered a speech, stating, "The majority of this Combined Fleet is here for training purposes. Although it is a very short time to anchor in Xiamen, we are honored and delighted to be visited by Mayor Li, representative of Chairman Chen, and Commander Lin and other officials and civilians of your country. In these times of global unrest, ensuring peace in East Asia and promoting the civilization of the Orient is the greatest task of both China and Japan. We must share this great responsibility. To this end, China and Japan must strengthen cooperation, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and fully understand each other. Just as China and Japan cannot, geographically, leave the current state, so too, spiritually, we believe there is a greater need for integration. The peace of the Orient must be maintained by the Oriental peoples themselves, and we have this firm resolve. However, we absolutely do not want to close the economic doors of the Orient to Europe and America, or trample on their vested interests. Not only do we not think that way, but we advocate an open-door policy for the entire world, not just for the Orient.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the navies of both countries will always maintain a special friendly relationship. This unique atmosphere of friendship between the two navies can be transferred to the atmosphere of Fujian Province and extended to the whole of China, so as to improve relations between the two countries. We hope to cooperate with each other and advance our mission endlessly.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a word to the Japanese and Taiwanese residents in Fujian: Our fleet is carrying out the above-mentioned national policy of Japan and is working day and night to support the prosperity of the country. You, in this region, should be the driving force for the co-existence and co-prosperity of Japan and China." After the banquet, Li Lin and others returned to Xiamen. At 2:00 PM, Takahashi, Katō, and others landed, first visiting Japanese Consul Yamada on Gulangyu. At 3:15 PM, they crossed to Xiamen and visited Li Shilin at the Municipal Government. At 4:00 PM, they visited Lin Guogeng at the Fortress Headquarters. Afterwards, they toured the city. At 5:00 PM, the Japanese Consul held a tea party at the consulate, hosting Takahashi and more than 20 other important generals, and invited Li Shilin, Lin Guogeng, and representatives from various organizations, communities, gentry, and merchants, as well as Japanese and Taiwanese gentry and merchants, and foreign consuls, to attend. At 7:00 PM, Li Shilin hosted a banquet for Takahashi and other important military officers at Nanputuo Temple. Takahashi and others returned to their ships after 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Returning to Port: According to Suga, the Naval Attaché at the Japanese Consulate-General in Fujian, the Combined Fleet exercise is being held for the first time in 20 years. The strength of the Japanese Navy today is incomparable to what it was 20 years ago. Therefore, this exercise can be said to be unprecedented. The Japanese Combined Fleet is formed by drawing forces from various fleets. The essence of the Japanese Navy is almost entirely gathered here. Furthermore, the propaganda materials distributed by the Japanese fleet in Taiwan and Xiamen call the Empire the "Invincible Fleet." Their ambition to dominate the seas is evident. In the implementation phase of the "North Defense, Southward Advancement" policy, the "Surface of the South Seas" and "Behind the South Seas" policies have placed the entire South Seas, Australia, and South China within their purview. Moreover, there has been a month-long grand exercise in the South Seas, and the return journey involves a show of force in the Fujian Sea. It cannot be said that this is meaningless. Although the Japanese side strongly denies that there is any intent, the Japanese-language newspapers here published a statement by a Japanese Navy official on the 3rd, stating, "The movement of the Combined Fleet to the Taiwan area is an opportunity for training. Visiting South China, which has close relations with us, is the mission of the fleet. In addition to security duties, we will engage in friendly exchanges with local officials and civilians, and enable fleet soldiers to personally see and deeply understand the Republic of China. Similarly, we hope that Chinese people will take this opportunity to approach and accurately understand the reality of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Those who engage in malicious propaganda are committing a serious insult to the Japanese Navy." This is a statement to dispel rumors, while 76 ships are scattered like stars inside and outside the port of Xiamen, with warships connected end to end and masts in sight, making one almost suspect that the Egret River has become the Red Cliff. When the fleet was in Taiwan, aircraft carriers and aircraft formations soared. The Japanese-language newspapers here also stated that because Xiamen is considered foreign territory, the aircraft of the aircraft carriers were inconvenient to take off and soar, fully displaying their heroic posture. Their words seem to contain regret, and also seem to contain some meaning. (August 6)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Further Progress in Anti-Smuggling in North China: Li Tonghua Comes North to Investigate the Situation, Inspection Offices to Be Set Up on the Ping-Sui Railway <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Li Tonghua, Deputy Director of the Railway Transportation Anti-Smuggling Inspection Office, arrived in Tianjin from Jinan on the evening of the 3rd to investigate the smuggling situation here. He visited Customs Commissioner Xu Liya and Anti-Smuggling Commissioner Spru the morning of the 4th at 10:00 AM to exchange opinions on the anti-smuggling efforts on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Xu Liya and Spru described the current situation of ronin smuggling centered on Tianjin. At noon, they accompanied him to inspect the Jindong Station of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway so that he could practically understand the current situation of smuggled goods being transported from Jidong by train. At 9:00 AM on the 5th, Li and Xu went to the Beijing-Shenyang Railway Bureau to visit Director Chen Juesheng and exchange methods for intercepting goods from Jidong, intending to request the Railway Bureau to assist in order to completely eradicate the problem. In the afternoon, he visited Feng Heming, Director of the Tianjin Office of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, to discuss anti-smuggling efforts in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in detail. Li stayed in Tianjin for two days and was scheduled to go to Ping on the 6th, first investigating along the Ping-Sui Railway, and then returning south after investigating the Beijing-Hankou Railway. According to Li's inquiries from Jinan to the north along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, the trend of smuggling on passenger trains on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway has almost completely disappeared. Only ronin continue to secretly transport small batches of goods on freight trains, but the situation south of Dezhou is not as rampant as before. However, smuggled goods landed from Qingdao still occasionally pass through Jinan to the south. Smuggling on passenger and freight trains on the Beijing-Hankou Railway is said to be more stringent than on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway due to the establishment of inspection offices along the line. Smuggled goods have almost ceased to be transported on this route for a month. However, the ronin, due to the mountains of goods piled up in Tianjin and the excessive losses, have no choice but to risk smuggling. Therefore, there has recently been the organization of a death squad, carrying weapons, to transport goods to the hinterland of southern Hebei by car and sailboat. In addition, they load goods in Fengtai and transport them to the northwest along the Ping-Sui Railway. The Inspection Office believes that it is necessary to set up inspection branches in the area north of Dezhou on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, east of Zhoucun on the Jiaoji Railway, and along the entire Ping-Sui Railway. If anti-smuggling efforts in this area are strict, although there is no immediate solution to smuggling in Jidong, North China can temporarily achieve a slight improvement. The Dezhou Inspection Branch has been established for a long time and will soon exert its powers. The Ping-Sui and Jiaoji Railway Branch Offices will be arranged in the field by Ansier after Li himself completes the investigation and returns to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Finance. In the future, anti-smuggling efforts on the Jiaoji Railway will focus on Zhoucun, while anti-smuggling efforts on the Ping-Sui Railway will focus on Zhangjiakou and Pingdiquan.</p>
<p>The reason why the General Inspection Office believes that there is no need to set up an inspection branch in Tianjin is that there is a Tianjin Customs here. Therefore, the personnel of the Inspection Office who worked in Tianjin before, including Englishman Archie, have all been ordered to return to Pukou to serve. Although Tianjin Customs is making every effort to implement anti-smuggling work, smuggled goods transported daily from Jidong to Tianjin Station still cannot be directly detained. Although smuggled goods transshipped from Tianjin to the south are not transported via the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, ronin charter civilian ships and long-distance buses to transport them along the Ziya River, Daqing River, North-South Grand Canal, and the Jinji and Jinbao Highways. The time of smuggling is mostly at midnight. Customs officers are afraid of provoking accidents if they forcibly intercept them because many ronin carry weapons. Customs Commissioner Xu Liya recently visited Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong, Security Commander Liu Jialuan, and Liu Yanquan, Director of the Wuhe Water Police Bureau, one after another for this matter, requesting assistance from the military and police agencies to intercept them. Various agencies have agreed that since August 3, armed military and police checkpoints have been set up at key intersections in the suburbs of Tianjin, such as Xiyingmen, to assist Tianjin Customs anti-smuggling personnel in interception. Those who are engaged in this business in the Japanese Concession have suffered excessive losses. More than a dozen smuggling firms that could not support themselves and went bankrupt last week.

<h3 id="e85">Hurricane and Heavy Rain Cause Disaster in Zhangzhou: River Water Surges 15 Feet, Upstream Counties Also Report Flooding <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: This hurricane from the South Pacific struck the Philippines, arriving near Dongsha Island on the 1st of this month. At about 2:00 AM on the morning of the 2nd, it landed between Shantou and Xiamen, accompanied by heavy rain. The wind direction was northeast, moving at 35 kilometers per hour, so the wind force was very strong. It lasted for 24 hours and completely left Xiamen after 2:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd. As a result, all maritime transport and small ferries traveling to and from the inland areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou were suspended throughout the 2nd. All highway buses in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou were also suspended. Even the small boats crossing between Xiamen and Gulangyu were forced to stop, and transportation was completely cut off. The Zhangzhou-Xiamen telephone line was also blocked. In Zhangzhou, from the night of the 1st to 5:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, there was torrential rain, which was extremely violent. Mountain torrents poured down from the upper reaches of the Zhang River and the Jiulong River. At the same time, the wind stirred up the sea tide, which flowed back into the river mouth from the port of Xiamen, so that the river water could not be discharged. The river water rose 15 feet in 48 hours. The fields and gardens along the banks of the Zhang River and the Jiulong River were turned into a swamp. The Zhangsong, Zhangfu, Longzhao, and Zhanglong highways were all submerged and suspended. On the night of the 1st, there was heavy rain. On the morning of the 2nd, the water level in the South River had risen five or six feet. In the afternoon, Honglou Society, Xiyao, Xialiao, and Longyantang along the river in the West Gate were all submerged. Punan, Aopu, Pengzhou, Guokeng, Zhangbin, and other places in the Jiulong River basin were also flooded. The waves were raging. Dameixi, Wuqitang, and Xintang in the southern countryside were all flooded. On the evening of the 2nd, the river water had landed in the southern market of Zhangzhou. By 9:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd, the water depth in Yanglaozhou, Chengguan Road, and Xingmin West Road in the southern market of Zhangzhou reached three or four feet. The water depth in Nanshi Street, Longyanying, Xiuwen West Road, and Shiwei reached the knees. At this point, the water level had risen 15 feet compared to before the wind and rain. On the afternoon of the 3rd, the water continued to rise. The deepest points in Longyanying, Shaositu, Guangnan Road, Dingwei South Road, Xiasha, and Yanglaozhou reached four feet, and the shallowest points were also a foot or so. On the night of the 3rd, the water level stabilized and did not rise any further. On that day, floating corpses floated down from the upper reaches of the South River, coming with the mountain torrents from the upper reaches. Therefore, it is known that Nanjing, Pinghe, Changtai, Hua'an, Longyan, and Yongding will also report flooding. This time, the water force in the West Stream was greater than that in the North Stream, so the impact on the villages along the West Stream was also greater. Fortunately, Zhangzhou is a subtropical region, and the autumn rice matures early and has just been harvested, so although there is a disaster, it is not very serious. When Jinshan and other villages in the first district of Nanjing County were hit by the hurricane, dozens of large trees were knocked down and many houses collapsed. Wu, a villager in Jinshan, was crushed to death by a tree. On the 3rd, land and sea transportation resumed. On the 4th, the Zhangsong and Zhangfu highways were damaged and closed for repairs. They did not resume traffic until the 5th. The water in Zhangzhou and along the river began to recede on the morning of the 4th and had completely receded by the morning of the 5th. (August 6)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Li Bai Actively Prepares for War: Central Army and Guangdong Army Arrive at the Guangxi Border, Merchants and Residents of Wuzhou Evacuate, Traffic Obstructed <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: It is recently heard that Li Bai in Guangxi Province is developing a new situation in Nanning. According to visitors returning from Wuzhou yesterday, Li Bai's attitude is quite firm. He held an oath ceremony for anti-Japanese war officials in Nanning on the 1st of this month. More than 200 Guangxi army division and regiment commanders attended. Li Zongren presided over the meeting. After the meeting, the division and regiment commanders returned to their defenses on the same day to preside over military affairs. Therefore, for a time, Guangxi Province was filled with a wartime atmosphere. The Guangxi armies and militias will be divided into four columns to respond to the war. Each column has two divisions of troops and a number of militias. A commander is appointed. Liao Lei, Commander of the 7th Army, serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the First Route, responsible for guarding the Liuzhou, Qingyuan, and Baise areas. Li Pinxian, Commander of the 8th Army, serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route, responsible for the defense of Guilin, Liuzhou, Fuchuan, and Hexian. Xia Wei, Commander of the 15th Army, serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Third Route, guarding Wuzhou, Yulin, and the border adjacent to the southern part of Guangdong. Wei Yunsong serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route, guarding the Baise and Huanglubba areas on the Yunnan border. Li Bai initially planned to concentrate heavy troops in Wuzhou. Later, because Wuzhou had no defensible terrain, he decided to abandon Wuzhou and make Teng County the first line of defense on the eastern route. The Zhou Zhaohuang Division stationed there has withdrawn from Wuzhou to the Jieshou, Pingnan, and Teng County areas. At present, all large and small civilian ships in Wuzhou have been chartered clean. All bamboo rafts and wooden rafts berthed in Wuzhou have also been moved to Jilongzhou on the opposite bank of Wuzhou to block the river surface. Merchants and residents in Wuzhou have now been completely evacuated. Cargo transportation has completely stopped. Strong men from various villages near Wuzhou have returned to their units one after another. The situation is very busy. At present, all ferries from Wuzhou to Guangdong have been suspended. Only the Hong Kong-Wuzhou steamships operate as usual. However, they are crowded with evacuees and there is no room to stand. There have been no battles yet. The rumor that the two armies in Fengchuan have been in contact is completely false. However, the Guangxi government's preparations for war are still meticulous. All wartime highway construction in the province, automobile transportation, telephone pole replacements, registration of helmsmen and drivers, and collection of bamboo, wood, and food in various villages have been properly arranged. In addition, defensive fortifications are being built as quickly as possible. Based on this situation, Li Bai's attitude can be seen. (August 9)</p>

<p>Since the beginning of this year's Great Heat solar term in summer, there have been consecutive days of showers, interspersed with gales. Although the climate is cooler, the rural fields are in the midst of fertilization, and those that have been flooded will inevitably affect the autumn harvest. Farmers are worried. This morning at about 4:00 AM, a storm and rain came together. Half of the rural sheds were destroyed by the wind. Many peaches and plums in the orchards were blown down. The house next to the east side of the county government hall, which was previously the barracks of the 12th Security Brigade, also collapsed in the heavy rain on the evening of the 3rd, with beams and wood collapsing with a crash. Fortunately, no one was injured. After the heavy rain this morning, the rear beam of the Second Hall sank, and the building was about to collapse. After Secretary Shen and Section Chief Chen surveyed the area, they ordered the servants to temporarily block the road passing through the area, and at the same time hired workers to survey and estimate the cost, and reported to request funds for repairs. Summer-like actions in autumn, with continuous rainy weather, the losses in various parties are quite substantial.</p>

<p>Fu Wenhe, the second son of Fu Yangshan, a resident of Liuhe Town in the county, is only 14 years old and is a fifth-grade student at Liuhe Elementary School. He usually likes to read newspapers, cares about national affairs, and is full of patriotic thoughts. During the Guangdong Incident, he left a letter and fled, walking along the Shanghai-Taicang Road to Shanghai to join the army. Because of his short stature, he was sent away. He went to Pudong and other places, but all failed. He then returned home, feeling regretful that his ambitions had not been fulfilled. He once told people that he would seek activities when the time was ripe. Unexpectedly, it became a reality. On the morning of the 4th, he fled for the second time, and was accompanied by Enfu, the youngest son of Wang Zhengji of the Tongchuntang Guoyue shop. After Fu and Wang disappeared from their respective families, they were extremely anxious and have entrusted people to search everywhere.</p>

<p>Recently, hooligans have been rampant in Suzhou, and bloody cases have occurred repeatedly. The authorities have paid great attention to this. At 7:00 PM on the evening of the 5th, in the Shuanglong Teahouse in Lianxi Lane in the city, a tea guest named Xu Amao had a conflict with Zhu Agen over a trivial matter. They were arguing at the teahouse. Unexpectedly, with a disagreement, Xu immediately used a sharp chisel to stab Zhu Agen four times in a row. Zhu was seriously injured and immediately fell to the ground. Later, the police on duty arrived, arrested the murderer Xu Amao, and took him to the station. At the same time, the injured person was sent to Boxi Hospital for treatment. Due to excessive blood loss, his life was in danger. After Xu Amao was arrested, he was sent to the Public Security Bureau on the 6th and then transferred to the Local Court for interrogation.</p>

The vacancy was filled by Dong Zhongsheng. After Director Zhao received the order, he immediately complied with the handover. Various public legal groups such as the Wuxian Agriculture, Commerce, and Education sectors sent telegrams to the provincial government requesting him to stay, but to no avail. The new director, Dong Zhongsheng, arrived in Suzhou on the 5th and took office at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 6th. He also gave instructions to the staff, ordering them to work with peace of mind. After Zhao Tinggan handed over his post, he went to Jiading to take up his new position on the same day.</p>

<p>The field tax office of the county government in this county sent personnel to collect fishing taxes from fishermen on the shores of Taihu Lake. A total of more than 500 yuan was collected each year. After retaining 171 yuan for the county, the rest was remitted to the provincial government. Recently, the provincial government found that the amount of this tax was very small, tantamount to extortionate levies, so it instructed the county government to abolish it. After County Chief Long received the order, he issued a public notice yesterday that the fishing tax collected would be abolished from the 25th year onwards. However, old debts from before would still need to be collected. In addition, the County Fishery Association was also notified by the county government to all fishermen to organize and establish it before the end of August.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the burden on the people, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has repeatedly abolished various extortionate levies. It is now known that the fifth batch of extortionate and miscellaneous levies from various counties has been submitted to the provincial government for record and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance.

<p>The commerce of this county relies on the grain merchants outside the South Gate as its lifeblood. Since the beginning of summer this year, the wheat harvest has been abundant, and manufacturers from Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, and other places have dispatched specialists with postal orders to set up shops and purchase grain. There are over thirty such firms, each using the grain merchants as agents to purchase grain. The larger ones purchase thirty to forty thousand piculs each day, while even the smaller ones purchase around ten thousand piculs. As a result, the grain merchants have finally begun to see a slight turnaround in their fortunes. However, the head of the Business Tax Bureau, Zang Langxuan, suddenly received an order to impose a nutrition tax starting on August 1st, taxing at a rate of five per mille based on value, which is 1.5 fen per picul. Neighboring counties have not implemented this, and its impact is extremely large. On the first day, all grain merchants specially requested the County Chamber of Commerce to negotiate with Bureau Chief Zang, but to no avail. On the second day, all visiting merchants sought to sell their grain elsewhere, and all firms and companies stopped buying. The entire market suspended business for the day, affecting the livelihoods of thousands of people. All the grain merchants decided to send representatives to the Finance Department to petition, and will not stop until their goal is achieved. On the afternoon of the third day, at 4:00 PM, forty to fifty grain merchant firms and over five hundred porters gathered and went to the Party and government organs to petition. Business has now been suspended for three days, causing extremely large losses.</p>

<p>Zhu Hongquan, a bill collector for the Yuansheng Rice Shop in Tanghui, Jiaxing, collected payments from Chang'an, Xiashi, and other places on the fourth day. He arrived in Jiaxing on the night train. After getting off the train in the seedling nursery area, he was robbed of 800 yuan in paper money and 17 yuan in coins. He also suffered a head injury from a club. After immediately reporting to the detective agency, the police squad began investigating separately, but without any trace. On the fifth day, Wang Qiqing, a member of the Public Security Bureau, along with Detective Li Zhankui and Patrol Officer Chen Bingwen, conducted investigations in various places. Finally, they went to Zhu's home on Zhaqian Street to investigate. Zhu's statements were inconsistent. Therefore, that afternoon, the police were ordered to bring Zhu in for interrogation. After Shen Ziqi, the manager of the Jinhongxing Rice Shop in Chang'an, went to the bureau to testify, Zhu confessed that he had embezzled private funds and resorted to this scheme. The wound on his head was also self-inflicted. The truth of the case was thus revealed. The Public Security Bureau is now preparing to transfer this case to the county government for review and handling.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Hangzhou: Bandits Burn and Loot Kaihua County <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Kaihua County was captured by bandits on July 8th, who indulged in looting and plunder. Although the province sent teams to increase defense and suppress the bandits, the bandit forces were slightly restrained. However, the bandit atmosphere soon intensified again. On August 3rd, at 8:00 PM, over two thousand bandits, divided into six groups, harassed the major villages of the fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, eleventh, fifteenth, sixteenth, and thirtieth du (districts) of Xianhua. They burned down forty to fifty civilian houses, took away over thirty residents, and caused property losses exceeding 30,000 yuan. They began to retreat successively on the morning of the fourth day, returning to their old nest in the Jiulong Mountains. The security team, with its disparity in numbers, shortened its defense line to protect the county town. The bandits are currently occupying the Dashan area of the county's fourth du, threatening to invade Suian, Changshan, and Qu County. The situation is critical. Over four hundred refugees from Kaihua, including Zhang Baoshu, jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, requesting the dispatch of a large army to suppress and pacify the bandits. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan, Most Urgent: Red bandits are rampaging through Kaihua County and other counties in southern Zhejiang. Fully equipped with firearms, they are scattered throughout the countryside, burning, looting, and occupying the Dalong Mountains to form a county-level Soviet government. They are actively distributing food, managing the baojia system, and training militiamen. It is estimated that the total number of pro-bandit civilians in the county has reached 30,000. One part of the bandits is currently occupying the Taishan area in the eastern countryside, threatening to invade Suian, Changshan, and Quzhou counties, seeking to establish connections. Rumors are rampant. However, the provincial troops are weak and unable to provide rescue.

<h3 id="e98">Ningbo: Seizure of Smuggled Goods at Shenshi Bridge <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Shen Yongfa, the former village head of Shenshi Bridge in Cibei, along with his clansmen Shen Wenzhao and Shen Jinzhang, smuggled Japanese goods to Ningbo, evading national taxes. They formed a close-knit group with local porters. Therefore, since last year, they have smuggled countless goods, making it impossible to seize them all. At dawn on the fourth of this month, Shen and others transported a large ship of cigarette paper, rayon, white sugar, kerosene, and other goods from Dalian, worth over 20,000 yuan. The ship docked at the Puhai Beach directly below Shenshi Bridge. The local porters routinely move the goods ashore. However, this time, because there were too many goods, the original agreed-upon porterage fee of one hundred yuan was insufficient. Several ruffians demanded four hundred yuan before they would move the goods. This led to a conflict, almost resulting in violence. Shen Yongfa and others, seeing the dispute unfold and fearing the worst, fled. At this time, over a hundred porters and four hundred private vendors were at a stalemate. One person went to the Guanhaiwei Public Maritime Sub-bureau to report the smuggling and seek a reward. The bureau immediately telegraphed the Zhejiang Maritime Customs Tax Affairs Department, the Zhejiang Maritime Customs Supervision Office, the Yin District Security Command, and the headquarters of the Ministry of Finance's 72nd Tax Police Team. Upon receiving the report, each agency dispatched teams to rush to investigate. They intercepted two hemp sacks of cigarette paper and one barge of white sugar. The remaining smuggled goods and smugglers had all escaped without a trace. The Shenshi Town baojia authorities have been ordered to surrender them within a limited time. As for the rumors circulating that porters and vendors clashed, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries, these are not true.</p>

<p>Xie Awei, a resident of Xixie in Ronghu Street, Sixth District of Fenghua, was a mountain goods vendor. Late last month, he returned home from Ningbo with 160 yuan in paper money. After arriving home, he placed it in the bedside and dresser drawers, preparing to distribute it to various goods suppliers the next day. Unexpectedly, three bandits, armed with wooden-cased guns, broke into Awei's bedroom that night. Awei, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately fled. His wife, Wang, was seized by the bandits, and after a disagreement, she was fatally shot by the bandits. Their three-year-old daughter, who was being held, suffered a serious leg wound from a bullet. The bandits then looted all the hidden paper money and left. The military police were notified to pursue and arrest the bandits, but they had already fled far away without a trace.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Industrial Federation Asks the Ministry to Organize Guangdong's Industry <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese General Federation of Industry held a standing committee meeting yesterday. Those in attendance included Guo Shun, Hu Xiyuan, Zhu Gengtao (representing Hu Xiyuan), Cai Shengbai, and Wang Qiyu. The general manager, Qian Chengxu, was present as an observer. The meeting was chaired by Guo Shun. Cai Shengbai proposed ideas for organizing Guangdong's industry, and it was resolved to prepare a document to submit to the Ministry of Industry for review and action.</p>
<p>Petition</p>
<p>Submitting this petition to enumerate opinions on organizing Guangdong Province's industry, respectfully requesting review and adoption. Guangdong is a southern Chinese industrial region, an area where production urgently needs to be developed. In recent years, thanks to the efforts of local individuals, many industries have been actively managed and are showing a thriving atmosphere. However, inappropriate distribution of types of industries or inappropriate decisions on business policies often easily leads to uneven distribution of market areas, reducing production strength. This federation organized the Liangguang Industrial Inspection Group this spring, going to conduct on-site inspections. What was seen and heard led to the deep realization that provincial operation policies, based on the local situation, seem not to be entirely appropriate. Moreover, provincial self-sufficiency and self-supply, if improperly used, can easily lead to economic division, affecting China's entire production. We respectfully enumerate our opinions for your ministry to adopt and implement, as this would be truly convenient for the public. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Industry, Wu.</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Proposed methods for the Ministry of Industry to organize Guangdong Province's industry are as follows: A. In the current situation, Guangdong's industry should be judged separately based on the advantages of climate and geography to determine the principles of expansion and abandonment. (1) For any industry where there is an abundance of naturally endowed raw materials, unique labor advantages, and the quality of its products can be manufactured to be superior compared to foreign products, this industry should be expanded, such as Guangdong's sugar, hemp spinning, steel refining, and silk reeling factories, etc. (2) For any industry where there are no suitable local raw materials, the skills of the workers are not as good as foreign workers, and the manufacturing cost is higher compared to foreign countries, this industry should be abandoned immediately and should not compete with foreign countries in manufacturing to consume the province's wealth, such as wool spinning and cotton weaving industries. B. Due to differences in economic conditions, the suitability of each industry itself should be studied to determine the principles of provincial operation and private operation. (1) For any industry that requires a large amount of capital or sophisticated technology, is highly international trade-oriented, or is a specialized industry whose products are not in high demand domestically and must be promoted with special efforts, this type of industry should be operated by the state or province. (2) For any industry whose nature is ordinary consumables, is light and easy to produce, and does not require mass production or large amounts of capital, Guangdong's existing industries, in whole or in part, should be classified as privately operated, promoted for development under government guidance, and improved for output, with the government's established experimental institutes, inspection institutes, and standards institutes guiding, organizing, and supervising. Where should what kind of factory be established, and what kind of factory should be state-operated or privately operated? Therefore, central planning is urgently needed. One aspect is to differentiate their trends, and the other aspect is to establish a foundation. Otherwise, it may be that the location and the people are not suitable, thus wasting resources and manpower, or that officials and people operate separately, arousing suspicion of competing for profits, or even that the production and sales areas cannot be unified, leading to chaos. These are all foreseeable facts. If everything is determined by the central government, then there will be a model to follow, and development will proceed rapidly and abundantly according to its program, time, and needs, regardless of whether it is state-operated or province-operated.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Concurrent Acting Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan Assumed Office Yesterday Afternoon, Convening All Staff for Instructions in the Afternoon, Handling the Takeover, No Changes to Bureau Members <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, after being ordered by the municipal government to concurrently act as Social Affairs Bureau Director, went to the bureau yesterday at 12:00 PM, accompanied by Social Affairs Bureau Assistant Secretary Chen Baohua, to assume office. After meeting with Social Affairs Bureau Secretary Li Suixian, Second Section Chief Wu Huanru, Third Section Chief Xu Yefu, and Fourth Section Chief Zhang Binghui, he received congratulatory guests such as Luo Qinghua and Ye Jiayu in the reception room, and issued a notice saying, "Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Notice No. 1: Case received Municipal Government Order No. 1548, which stated, 'Now appoint Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan to concurrently act as this city's Social Affairs Bureau Director. This order.' Therefore, I arrived at the bureau today to assume office. In addition to reporting and issuing separate letters, this notice is hereby issued for general knowledge. This notice, Republic of China, June 6, 25th year, Concurrently Acting Director Pan Gongzhan."</p>
<p>Calling Together for Instructions</p>
<p>Director Pan convened all staff in the bureau's auditorium yesterday at 2:00 PM for instructions, the gist of which was: Former Director Wu had a long history of engaging in revolution for the Party and the country, and he was also an old friend of mine for many years. This time, he passed away unfortunately due to overwork and illness, which is very regrettable. Yesterday, the mayor gave me face-to-face instructions, delegating the affairs of the Social Affairs Bureau to me as a concurrent role. As I already have many affairs in the Education Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau is also very complicated and demanding, with limited energy, it is difficult to take care of both. I requested the mayor to select other capable people. However, the mayor said that the Social Affairs Bureau is important and cannot be without someone in charge for even a day, and that I had previously held this position, and am a colleague of many years with the people in the bureau. It is my duty to concurrently maintain it, and I cannot refuse. Therefore, I only obey the order to temporarily come to the bureau to preside over it. All facilities in the bureau will remain as they are, and I hope the bureau's secretaries and section chiefs, as well as all colleagues, can uphold the spirit of former Director Wu and continue to work hard. At the same time, I hope the mayor can find capable people as soon as possible to formally take over, so that I can be relieved of my concurrent position and avoid overstepping my bounds.</p>
<p>Handling the Takeover</p>
<p>After Director Pan assumed office yesterday afternoon, he immediately announced Chen Baohua as full-time Assistant Secretary (formerly concurrently Chief of General Affairs), Assistant Secretary Hu Xianqiao (formerly Chief of Accounting), Accounting Section Chief Shen Shouchang (promoted from First Section staff), General Affairs Section Chief Zou Zhixian (promoted from First Section clerk), Dispatch Section Chief Fu Yinian (transferred from Fourth Section staff), First Section Documents Section Chief Shao Tongxuan (transferred from Fourth Section Documents Section Chief), Seal Custodian Shen Baozhen (transferred from Education Bureau First Section clerk), and Fourth Section Documents Section Chief He Jingyuan (promoted from First Section statistician and translator). There were no other changes. The new chiefs of the Accounting, General Affairs, and Dispatch sections immediately took over, and reported to the municipal government.</p>
<p>Deadline for Handling Backlogged Cases</p>
<p>Director Pan immediately issued an order at 3:00 PM yesterday, instructing Secretary Li Suixian to relay to First Section Chief Zhou Renlong, Second Section Chief Wu Huanru, Third Section Chief Xu Yefu, and Fourth Section Chief Zhang Binghui, to order their respective sections to complete at least half of the cases they are handling by August 15th, and to complete all cases by the end of August. If there are special reasons that make it impossible to complete them, they should state their reasons.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, at the second general meeting of the Second National Cotton Industry Inspection Conference on the 5th, because there were many proposals, it was not able to conclude. Therefore, the third meeting was continued from 9:00 AM yesterday morning until adjournment at noon. In the afternoon, the meeting continued, discussing 22 proposals, and passed them separately after amending them according to the review opinions. In accordance with the Ministry-promulgated Regulations for the Prohibition of Adulteration of Cotton, detailed inspection rules were formulated, which can be announced and implemented after being submitted to the Ministry for approval.

<h3 id="e103">Baoshan County Dike Works: No Worries About Autumn Floods, Temporary Emergency Engineering Established, Rushing to Repair Hurricane Damage <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, Baoshan County is located on the coast, connecting Shanghai and Taicang counties, and is in the path of the confluence of the East Sea, Yellow Sea, and Yangtze River. The seawall project is the most important area in Jiangnan. Every autumn, the tides are especially strong. If it encounters a storm, the impact will be even greater. Last year, the Jiangsu Province Jiangnan Water Conservancy Engineering Office prepared for flood prevention work in a relatively thorough manner. However, due to funding constraints, before universal repairs were made, emphasis was still placed on emergency work. Currently, the Xiaosabei, Chenhuabin, and Wuyuedun sections all have temporary emergency engineering equipment such as sack filling and stone throwing to prevent any accidents. Therefore, the flood prevention work is relatively thorough. This year's autumn floods should be free from danger. The hurricane on the 3rd of this month struck Japan from the East Sea, with Wusongkou directly in the hurricane's left wing. Therefore, at that time, the wind and rain were violent, and the sea waves were turbulent and abnormal, causing slight damage to the dike works in various sections of the county. Five or six places in the Shidong section were destroyed by the waves. Zhang Mingjing, the county magistrate of the county, went to each section to conduct a detailed inspection the day before yesterday, accompanied by Secretary Bai Mingdao and Third Section Chief Qi Yunzhong. He supervised the Dike Works Office to repair the places that were slightly cracked, and is currently sending additional workers to rush the repairs on the collapsed sections of Shidong.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Sichuanese in Shanghai Oppose Establishment of Consulate in Chengdu, Telegraphed Various Sectors in Sichuan, Prevented Japanese Consul from Assuming Office, Municipal Federation Submitted a Request for Serious Negotiations <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Japan established a consulate in Chengdu. Its consul, Iwai Eiichi, has already passed through Beijing from Shanghai, amidst the opposition of our countrymen, and has taken a ship to Chengdu. Various Sichuanese sectors in Shanghai, opposing the establishment of a consulate in Chengdu, urgently telegraphed various Sichuanese groups yesterday, preventing Iwai from entering the country and assuming office, and sent Zhou Junshi as a representative to Beijing, to submit a request to the National Government instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to achieve the purpose of negotiating for cancellation. At the same time, they contacted fellow countrymen in Beijing to act together.</p>
<p>The Municipal First Special District Citizens' Federation submitted a request to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating that they were submitting a request for negotiations regarding the establishment of a Japanese consulate in Chengdu to maintain sovereignty. Chengdu is not a commercial port or a major trading center. According to international law and treaties historically signed by our country, there is no reason to set up a consulate. Currently, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is disregarding international law and ignoring the facts, appointing Iwai Eiichi, the China Information Director of the Embassy, as the Consul of Chengdu. Iwai has already gone to Beijing on the second of this month and has transferred to the Luoyang Maru to go to Chengdu to take up his post. The news has spread, and we are very alarmed. Japan's sudden establishment of a consulate in Chengdu is nothing more than an attempt to use this to invade our hinterland, with other purposes. This federation, with matters concerning national sovereignty, cannot remain silent. After submitting it to the sixth executive committee meeting, it was decided, in addition to sending letters to all public groups in this city to unanimously advocate, to also request that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seriously negotiate, record it in the minutes, and specially submit it to your ministry, promptly negotiate seriously with the Japanese Embassy in China to maintain sovereignty and avoid causing other disputes. The country will be fortunate. Also, the association sent letters to various public groups in this city, briefly stating that Japan has violated international law and is establishing a consulate in Chengdu. In addition to requesting that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs negotiate seriously, we also hope to advocate unanimously to maintain sovereignty.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Wang Kemin Discusses Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation, No Specific Measures Yet <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, Wang Kemin, Chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, has been repeatedly rumored to be taking office in the north, but has not yet done so. What is his attitude? The outside world urgently wants to understand. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Wang at his private residence on Yuyuan Road yesterday to inquire about the situation. We were granted an audience and made the following remarks. Wang first described his recent visit to Beijing, saying that he received a telegram from Foreign Minister Zhang on the 31st, inviting him. He went to Beijing on the evening of the 1st. In Beijing, he only met with Minister Zhang (Qun) and Minister He (Yingqin). Zhang wanted him to go to Lushan, but Wang said that everything was uncertain. Zhang then telegraphed Wang's intentions to President Chiang. Then, the reporter asked about the previous rumors that he had offered his resignation. Wang replied that this statement was incorrect. He had not resigned, but he would not go north for the time being. The reporter then asked what difficulties there were. Wang replied that there were difficulties in many aspects, but he was unwilling to disclose the details to avoid causing misunderstandings. Recently, there have been no telegrams between him and Chairman Song (Zheyuan). He only sent a letter after returning to Shanghai from Beiping, describing the details of the talks in Beijing. Later, Song replied, urging him to go north. Last Friday, Wang asked a friend to take another letter, reporting the situation after the previous letter. Regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, there are no so-called specific measures at present, because this cannot be achieved in a day or two. There is currently not much contact between China and Japan. As for the situation in North China, it is currently stable on the surface. How it will be in the future is difficult to predict. There is always the possibility of danger, but the Japanese side does not seem to intend to take any action. Finally, Wang said that he met with Finance Minister Kong on his trip to the capital. At that time, Kong only urged him to go north and did not express any other opinions.</p>

<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, due to the soaring and plummeting prices of the Flour Exchange last month, and the unprecedented increase in trading volume, which clearly indicated speculation by certain elements, imposed price limits twice, on July 8th and July 18th, to restrict such activities. Recently, trading volume has decreased from over 12.4 million bags to over 5.1 million bags. The Exchange applied to the Bureau of Social Affairs to abolish the price limits, which was approved. The price limits were abolished yesterday, and January futures opened for trading.</p>
<p>Prices Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Trading Volume Not High. After implementation yesterday, opening market prices were: August at $3.14, September at $3.18, October at $3.25, November at $3.28, December at $3.31, and January at $3.40. Closing prices were: August at $3.1775, September at $3.21, October at $3.25, November at $3.28, and January at $3.37. Compared to the previous day, August rose by 6 cents, September rose by 9 cents, October rose by 10 cents, and November rose by 10 cents. Trading volume remained low.</p>
<p>Additional Margin Call for Sellers</p>
<p>Because the Exchange abolished price limits and prices rose, it announced yesterday that sellers must provide additional margin. The additional margin for August is calculated as follows: (1) if the price is below $3.0525, (2) if the price is below $2.9275, (3) if the price is below $2.80025. For September: (1) if the price is below $3.09, (2) if the price is below $2.965, (3) if the price is below $3.84. For October: (1) if the price is below $3.125, (2) if the price is below $3.00, (3) if the price is below $2.875. For November: (1) if the price is below $3.155, (2) if the price is below $3.03, (3) if the price is below $2.9005. For December: (1) if the price is below $3.185, (2) if the price is below $3.06.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith Hilder, an Australian amateur aviator, flew from Fuzhou to Longhua Airport at 2:40 PM on the 5th. He originally planned to fly to Nanjing yesterday to visit the Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Mr. Bogomolov, to request the Soviet Russian government to allow him to fly to Europe via Russian territory. However, after learning that Mr. Bogomolov was resting in Qingdao, he cancelled the trip and invited Sir Brenan, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, to visit Mr. Spilvanyk, the Soviet Russian Consul-General in Shanghai, to discuss methods of flying over Russian territory. Mr. Hilder's trip to Europe requires passing through Manchuria and Soviet Russia. The Manchurian side has already given its permission, but the Russian side has not yet agreed, citing military reasons for not approving. Mr. Hilder believes that it may be possible to negotiate a detour route that does not interfere with military affairs. However, according to experts in this city, detours are very dangerous and this should be carefully considered.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Deadline for Supplementary Registration Approaching; Cracked Down on Opium Dens and Smokers; 88 People Arrested in the Old North Gate Area <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>88 People Arrested in the Old North Gate Area Since the Municipal Public Security Bureau began accepting supplementary registration of opium smokers on May 10th of this year, all unregistered smokers have been allowed to register. The deadline of August 10th is fast approaching. If anyone still intends to evade registration, once the deadline has passed, any unregistered smokers found will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and punished according to the anti-opium laws, without leniency. In recent days, the various branches have received many requests for supplementary registration. However, during the registration of opium smokers reported by the various branches, many cases of opium dens, unlicensed smoking, and illegal use of permits have been uncovered. In recent days, the Old North Gate Police Station has cracked down on several opium dens within its jurisdiction, arresting a total of 88 opium smokers. All have been sent to the headquarters for interrogation according to the law.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Dada Steamship Company in this city, which owns the Dada, Dahe, Daqing, and Guangxiang ships, operates services between Shanghai and various ports along the Yangtze River, including Tongzhou, Yangzhou, and Chongming. To facilitate transportation in northern Jiangsu and develop shipping, the company has reorganized the river vessel bureaus in northern Jiangsu and implemented joint river transport on six routes: Shanghai-Yangzhou-Tongzhou-Taizhou-Haian-Dongtai. Mr. Zai Xianglun and Yi Yingfu, directors of the Nantong Tianshenggang Port, have been appointed to be responsible for handling the matter. The takeover of six vessels operating on the inland rivers, including the Da Xiang, Da Xun, Da He, and Da Jin, as well as four barges, has been completed. The Tangzha Vessel Bureau has been abolished and is now under the unified management of the company. Two vessels will be dedicated to the Dongtai-Haian route, and the other four will be dedicated to the Tonghai (Nantong to Haian) route. The first step is to implement joint transportation between Nantong and Haian, and then decide on the joint transportation of Huai'an, Dongtai, and Taizhou, to connect with the Shanghai-Yangzhou and other outer river routes. Northern Jiangsu is known for its abundant cotton and wheat production. After the implementation of joint transportation, products can be directly transported from the production areas to Shanghai for sale, avoiding the complexity of transshipment and reducing transportation costs significantly. This will greatly facilitate transportation in northern Jiangsu.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Large Number of Tax Police Stationed on Daishan Island; Fishermen Dare Not Venture Out to Sea to Fish; Zhuang Songfu and Others Telegraph the Ningbo Hometown Association for Assistance to Recall Tax Police, Soothe Refugees, and Eliminate Hidden Dangers <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Hometown Association telegraphed the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating, "According to a telegram from Zhuang Songfu, Wang Boxian, Lin Shouting, Mi Youzan, Chen Zhan'ao, Lin Hairui, Shen Yiben, and others from Fenghua, (the above is omitted). This is a decisive matter for the Daishan Island in Dinghai County. Due to the salt authorities' failure to adapt to the situation and lead by example in handling the change in fisheries and the consolidation of salt supervision, and due to the various forms of harassment and extortion by the tax police, the disaster of July 13th was triggered. The detailed circumstances have been reported by Commissioner Zhao of the Yin County District. We invite you to examine the reports, which are widely published in newspapers. We, Zhuang Songfu and others, will not go into unnecessary detail. Those who initiated the incident are undoubtedly guilty, but those who are law-abiding should be clearly distinguished. The livelihood of fishermen along the coast of eastern Zhejiang depends on the spring and autumn fishing seasons. Now is the beginning of the autumn season. Fishing firms are collecting capital and issuing loans, fishing factories are manufacturing and selling fishing nets, and fishing boats are venturing out to sea to fish. However, the salt authorities of Daishan have greatly increased the number of tax police, several times the usual amount. They indiscriminately threaten and intimidate fishermen and merchants from other regions who come to the island, and search ships. The atmosphere of terror has not been dispelled, and there is concern about being falsely accused. People are anxious and do not know what to do. Therefore, good fishermen dare not venture out to sea to fish, and fishing firms are hesitant to proceed. Their livelihoods are cut off, and they are forced into a difficult situation. If they take risks, the consequences are unimaginable. The most important task for the aftermath is not to arrest the perpetrators, but to reassure the good people. To reassure the good people, the tax police must first be withdrawn so that fishermen can safely venture out to sea and fishing firms can operate as usual. Then, the judicial authorities can arrest and punish the perpetrators, and those who were coerced should be pardoned. It is not appropriate to implicate too many people. This is in line with the principle of eliminating violence and reassuring the good people, and of giving the benefit of the doubt to the accused. It is also a way to protect the livelihoods of fishermen and eliminate hidden dangers. Zhuang Songfu and others feel that the situation is critical and cannot remain silent. Therefore, they dare to take the risk of speaking out and asking for assistance. We hope that your association will care for the homeland and speak out for justice. We are sending this telegram in the hope that you will all advocate for this. Fisheries and fishermen will be fortunate. The details of the unfortunate incident in Daishan are detailed in the telegrams that our association has sent. According to the telegram, the local authorities have dispatched a large number of tax police to be stationed, and the people are afraid of the past and deeply fear that they will take the opportunity to retaliate. They do not dare to work and live in peace. If this continues, the local area will be in a dire situation. The fellow villagers advocate that the key to the aftermath is not to arrest the perpetrators but to reassure the good people, which coincides with the views of our association. In light of the situation described in the telegram, we are urgently sending a telegram to request your review and support in order to eliminate hidden dangers and stabilize the people's hearts. We eagerly await your instructions. Qi Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Shanghai Hometown Association."</p>
<h3 id="e119">National Match United Company to Be Officially Established in October; Match Manufacturers to Voluntarily Control Production and Sales; More Than 80 Chinese and Japanese Factories Support <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, match manufacturing is a light industry, and a small-scale match factory can be operated with a capital of four to five thousand yuan. Therefore, since 1933, many new factories have been established. By the second half of 1934, due to overproduction and pressure from foreign forces and competition from fellow manufacturers, the entire Chinese match industry was in a state of bankruptcy and unable to struggle.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Promote Controlled Matches</p>
<p>On January 9th of this year, Chinese and Japanese match factories jointly proposed to establish a match united association, with match manufacturers voluntarily controlling production and sales. Most manufacturers expressed their approval of this principle. In March of this year, the Ministry of Industry approved the organization. For several months, the leaders of Chinese and Japanese manufacturers, Liu Hongsheng and Ueda, have been working tirelessly, and by the end of last month, the organization began to take shape.</p>
<p>More Than 80 Manufacturers Join</p>
<p>More than 80 match manufacturers have joined the United Company, including over 70 Chinese factories from 22 provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Shandong, Hunan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hubei. The Japanese side has joined with eight factories from Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places. The American-owned Meiguang Match Company in this city, after the earnest persuasion of both Chinese and Japanese sides, is also planning to join.</p>
<p>Continuous Negotiations on Implementation Matters</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reporter learned that Chinese and Japanese match merchants, in order to carry out the United Company, have been continuously represented by Liu Hongsheng, Xu Zhiyi, and other manufacturers, along with representatives from the Japanese factories, including Takawa, Kanayama, Hirajima, and Taniguchi, and secretary Ueda, negotiating the organization of controlled matches. It is reported that the name of the National Match United Association will be changed to National Match United Company.</p>
<p>Establishment Expected in Mid-October</p>
<p>As for the organization of the company, Liu Hongsheng will be the manager, and eight directors and two supervisors will be elected. The capital will be 5 million yuan, with Chinese merchants accounting for 75%, or 3.75 million yuan, and Japanese merchants accounting for 25%, or 1.25 million yuan. It is expected that the company will be officially established in mid-October of this year.</p>

<h3 id="e121">State-Owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Report on Reorganization (Continued) C. Personnel Reorganization <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>(1) Qualification Examination of Employees of the General and Branch Bureaus After the reorganization of the Bureau, the organizational structure changed, and the existing number of employees was excessive and had to be reduced. In order to eliminate the inferior and retain the superior and improve efficiency, a qualification examination for employees of the General Bureau was conducted in February of this year. In late February, an order was issued announcing the qualified employees who would be retained, and they were assigned to work in their original sections and units as section members and assistants. Those who failed the examination were given severance pay in accordance with the approved methods and dismissed. The qualification examination for personnel of the branch bureaus was also held in March. Those who had not taken the examination in the various bureaus and offices were allowed to take a supplementary examination at the Bureau in late April. Those who passed the examination were all announced in May and retained as clerks and assistants in accordance with the approved number. Those who failed the examination were also given severance pay and dismissed. (2) Implementation of Inspections for Shipboard Employees It has been found that shipboard employees often suffer from serious illnesses, physical disabilities, and mental decline, which has a significant impact on work efficiency and public health. Unless inspections are carried out, there is no way to distinguish between good and bad. Except for the engine room staff who have passed the qualification examination by the Maritime Affairs Bureau and are exempted from re-examination, all other shipboard staff are subject to inspection. For example, service staff (formerly tea attendants) and boiler stokers, as well as business staff, have all been examined in turn, and measures have been established. In addition to retaining those who are qualified, those who suffer from serious illnesses or have bad habits have been dismissed or suspended with pay for a period of time to receive treatment and return to service. This inspection work was carried out by doctors assigned by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and assisted by doctors from the Chinese Red Cross Hospital. After this inspection, not only did the employees themselves become more vigilant, but the efficiency of their work also indirectly increased, resulting in considerable intangible benefits. (3) Implementation of Employee Training In order to train employees' physique, increase their knowledge, and implement military training, the Bureau established an Employee Training Committee on May 29th of this year in accordance with the Ministry's order to be responsible for the work. All training plans and academic subjects, as well as schedules, were prepared in detail. Training was first carried out for service staff on the various ships, starting in July. Subsequently, training will be carried out in turn for other employees, such as dock porters and watchmen, until all employees have completed training. (4) Promotion of the New Life Movement It has been found that the old customs and bad habits of the Yangtze River ships are deeply ingrained. In the past, the Bureau's Yangtze River ships were not able to completely eliminate them. Now, the New Life Movement Promotion Association has dispatched two members to each of the Bureau's Yangtze River ships to guide the New Life Movement. Matters stipulated in the New Life Movement are being implemented, with particular emphasis on hygiene, cleanliness, work order, and convenience for passengers. It is expected that the old habits of the Yangtze River ships will be completely eradicated, and the New Life Movement regulations will be fully implemented. (5) Reorganization of Ticket Inspection Matters The Bureau's ships have been required to sell tickets on shore since the reorganization. Therefore, more attention should be paid to ticket inspection on board to prevent abuses and omissions. Currently, in addition to the Bureau's original ticket inspectors performing their duties, the Ministry has also assigned one ticket inspector per ship to assist in the inspection. Since implementation, not only has it been beneficial to the increase in business and passenger revenue, but also the other shipboard affairs have been inspected and improved. (6) Production and Issuance of Employee Uniforms, Badges, and Service Certificates</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for passengers to identify employees and to facilitate work assessment, the Bureau has produced and issued uniforms and badges for the service staff on each ship, and ordered them to wear them. In addition to registering all employees of the Bureau, branch offices, and ships, each employee is issued a service certificate. The certificate states the employee's name, origin, age, position, etc., and includes a photograph of the employee. The employee's service record and commendation and punishment records are recorded by the supervisor and reported to the Bureau for filing. The certificate must be carried at all times while on duty for inspection. The Bureau has now paid for the production of the certificates, which will be printed soon and issued separately. (7) Military Police Escorting Ships Since the reorganization of the Bureau, it has been ordered to dispatch military police to escort the ships and crack down on passengers without tickets. Since implementation, it has been quite effective. At the same time, except for special circumstances, wooden fences and rain shelters have been installed at the wharves of each port for ticket sales in order to facilitate inspection and convenience for passengers. (8) Restricting Vendors from Boarding Ships Vendors often board the ships at various ports along the Yangtze River to sell goods, causing a great deal of noise and affecting the peace and order on board. In order to ensure cleanliness, peace, and order on board, the Bureau has restricted vendors from boarding ships. Each branch bureau has been ordered to implement this measure and maintain the principle of not allowing vendors to board ships. Since implementation, not only has order on board been maintained, but also the number of quarrels and disputes has been reduced. (9) Holding Registration for Porters Dock porters have never been subject to management, which has had various adverse effects on the transportation of goods and luggage. In order to facilitate management, the Bureau has formulated plans to hold a registration for porters and ordered each branch bureau to comply. Currently, the branch bureaus have either not held registration due to the lack of porters, or have had to develop separate measures for handling the situation. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e122">After a Smoker Quits: The Problem of Punishment for Having the Addiction Without the Vice. The Shanghai County Government Explains Following Provincial Order, Stating That if One Has Already Quitted, It is Difficult to Impose Criminal Responsibility. <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai County Government received an order from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Provincial Government which stated: “Regarding the case where it was previously reported to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently Director-General of the Anti-Opium Bureau, Order No. 1574, based on the submission from Jian Minglong, Chairman of the Wujiang County Chinese Medicine Association, that smokers who have quit are being tested and found to have the addiction without the vice, yet are still being sentenced, which is a great loss of legal and moral fairness. Please order a correction, and investigate and report whether this province sentences smokers who have quit and are found to have the addiction without the vice, or whether there are other handling methods, for verification and approval.”</p>
<p>The response stated, "Regarding the matter of sentencing those found to have the addiction without the vice after testing, there is no definite standard, and we are experiencing difficulties during review. We request instructions on how to proceed."</p>
<p>The explanation is as follows: "Regarding initial opium use and initial drug use, if one has voluntarily quit or voluntarily entered a rehabilitation program before being discovered, even within the implementation period of the Anti-Opium Law, according to Article 16 of the Implementing Rules of the Anti-Opium Law, they 'may be exempted from punishment.' According to Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a notice of exemption from punishment may be issued. However, since the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Offenses of Opium and Drug Suppression do not have this provision, in the aforementioned circumstances, unless the prosecution has been reduced due to the statute of limitations, a decision not to prosecute should be made according to Article 231, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. However, they may only be granted exemption from punishment, non-prosecution, reduced punishment, or probation according to Articles 61, 293, and 232 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and Articles 59, 63, or 74 of the Criminal Law. In the case of smokers who have quit and have the addiction without the vice, the initial offense of opium use and the initial offense of drug use, if voluntarily quit or entered rehabilitation before discovery, are not expressly punishable by law and cannot be convicted. This has been repeatedly explained in previous cases. Although it cannot be determined when those with the addiction without the vice stopped using, it is clear that they voluntarily quit before being discovered. Therefore, it is difficult to impose criminal responsibility."</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders, this order is for the county magistrate to comply with.</p>

Subsequently, the Chengdu Road Police Department successively apprehended nine men and women, including Cao Chunbao, Lu Laisheng, Zhang Heshang, Zhang Xushi, and others, and rescued the hostage Xu Wenliang. They were sent to the First Special Court. The interrogation revealed that defendants Cao Chunbao and Shen Tingyan were injured and in the hospital, so the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>
<p>As reported in this newspaper, at around 9:00 PM the night before, Chinese Detective Feng Baishun and Detective Sun Wenxi of the Chengdu Road Police Department, together with the Municipal Public Security Bureau, apprehended Lu Zhifeng (nicknamed "Headless Ghost A-Liu"), a native of Ningbo and accomplice in the case, in Yanjiabao, Pudong. Yesterday morning, Du Haisheng (aka "Shaoxing A-Da"), also from Ningbo, was apprehended at the New New Inn at No. 138 Rue des Soeurs, French Concession. Both were brought back to the police station for detention.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated the case, saying that defendants Chen and Du had admitted to participating in the kidnapping of Xu Wenliang at the police station. As Cao Chunbao and Shen Tingyan had not yet recovered from their injuries, he requested permission for indefinite detention. After Judge Tan Xinzhen briefly questioned Chen and Du, he granted permission for detention and ordered that Cao Chunbao and others be interrogated together after their recovery.</p>

<p>Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, decided to recruit female police officers from the Police Officer Training School. After receiving the order, the school immediately issued a recruitment notice and stipulated the examination rules. Since registration began on the 25th of last month, it closed on the 5th of this month. A total of 273 people applied, mostly aged 19 to 28. The school has scheduled the examinations to begin at 9:00 AM today (the 7th). Today's test includes an oral exam in the morning and a physical exam in the afternoon.

<h3 id="e127">Shanghai South National Goods Exhibition Opens Mid-Month; Liyuan Cemetery Designated as Venue; Booth Locations to be Drawn on the 10th <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The National Goods Movement Association of Shanghai decided to hold a national goods exhibition in the South Shanghai district to promote the national goods industry and increase the production and sales power of national goods factories. The aim is to deeply imprint the slogan of "National Goods Save the Nation" on the minds of all Chinese people. The association decided that the North Shanghai National Goods Exhibition has already closed, so they designated Liyuan Cemetery at the intersection of Zhaozhou Road and Kangti Road in Shanghai as the venue, naming it the South Shanghai National Goods Exhibition, with an attached temporary commercial center. Registration has begun, and preparations are actively underway. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Active Preparations</p>
<p>Since the opening of registration for the South Shanghai National Goods Exhibition, manufacturers participating include Yongyu Industrial Company, Nanyang Soap Factory, Shixin Leather Factory, Baili Cosmetics Factory, Kaiming Cotton Weaving Factory, Minglai Cotton Weaving Factory, Sino-French Pharmacy, Shenxin Factory, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, and Meili Shoe Factory, among others. To expand the scope of the organization, the association has issued another notice to member factories to actively participate and construct booths. The association has dispatched staff members Ma Pingyuan, Wu Gechang, and Chai Guojun to supervise the construction daily to complete it as soon as possible so it can open on the 15th.</p>
<p>Novel Architecture</p>
<p>Because the exhibition venue faces the Second Special District, the association decided that the architecture of the venue should be novel and unique to attract the attention of the people in the Special District. The archway of the main entrance is made of wood, similar to the Qianmen gate in Beiping, with exquisite paint and active electric lights at night. To avoid mud, the sidewalks are paved with wood, and the entire venue is surrounded by reed fences with air vents to ensure air circulation. It is said that the design was planned by engineering expert Chen Kuan, but the cost is slightly expensive. The association has allocated funds to subsidize it without increasing the venue fees for manufacturers.</p>
<p>Opening on the 15th</p>
<p>The association originally scheduled the opening for the 10th of this month, but due to the time-consuming construction and the need to solicit manufacturers, preparations were not enough, so the opening has been changed to the 15th of this month. Booth locations will be drawn on the 10th. National goods factories in Shanghai who wish to participate can directly contact the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association at No. 4 Yongji Lane, Xizang Road, to obtain the charter and participate.</p>

The association's office is still located at No. 3, 2nd Floor, Hua'e Lane, Erma Road.</p>

It is said that there is no decision yet on when North Xizang Road will be renamed Xizang Road. Changing names is a major matter. Although the Municipal Council has notified the post office and public utility companies, the change in people's habits still takes time. Therefore, the renaming of North Xizang Road to Xizang Road must wait until the end of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Invention of Reed Pulp Paper Making Material; Submitted to the Ministry for Patent <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Bian Liangbo, a native of Huai'an, Jiangsu, realized that the purchase of foreign wood pulp for paper making materials resulted in a great loss of rights. He personally visited the production area of reeds and conducted investigations and research, inventing a kind of reed pulp for paper making materials. He previously applied to the Ministry of Industry for a patent, but it was not approved due to omissions. He is now reapplying to the Ministry of Industry, stating: "Submitting to supplement the omissions in the previous submission, requesting another review and special patent approval. The reed pulp invented by the applicant has also been tested by experts, and its nature and function are no less than that of foreign wood pulp. Recently, a detailed investigation was conducted in the reed production area, and it was found that there are as many as 3 million dan produced annually. If it is used for pulp making, 1.5 million shi can be obtained. To recover the lost rights, a joint venture has been agreed to set up a paper mill. If the patent part is not favorably considered, the future of the joint venture will collapse. The loss of personal spirit is limited, but the outflow of national rights is infinite. Furthermore, the Ministry has specially granted patents for the recently invented multi-filament light bulbs and three-way light bulbs. Considering their operation methods, they are nothing more than button rotations and the contact relationship with filaments. They were recognized as inventions because of their different characteristics, not the patent of the method. In accordance with Article 15 of the Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology, I am supplementing the reasons and submitting a document for review, hoping that you will grant special patent approval. It would be a great kindness. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry."</p>
<h3 id="e134">New Regulations for Licensing Public and Private Rickshaws and Rickshaw Pullers Announced <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The conditions for licensing public rickshaws and rickshaw pullers (public and private) have recently been revised and announced by the Municipal Council. The key points of the revision are described below:</p>
<p>The most important new regulations for licensing public rickshaw pullers are that licenses and armbands must not be lent to others. In addition, it is stipulated that if a rickshaw puller leaves Shanghai for more than half a month, the license and armband should be returned to the licensing office for temporary storage to prevent misuse by others. On the other hand, the rickshaw owner or contractor should be notified so that they can find a temporary replacement.</p>
<p>For private rickshaw pullers, the license and armband must not be lent to others. Furthermore, the rickshaw owner's license number and name must be noted on the rickshaw puller's license for frequent inspection. A new clause has also been added to the public rickshaw license, which aims to distinguish the rent paid by the rickshaw puller to the rickshaw owner from other items of money so that it is easier to investigate abuses such as overcharging rent. In addition, there are strict regulations regarding the installation of rickshaw lamps, the rickshaw puller's uniform, and raincoats. The name and address of the rickshaw contractor must also be reported to the Municipal Council by the rickshaw owner at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e142">City Federation Asks the French Municipal Council to Cancel the Deadline for Shack Relocation, and Expresses Gratitude for Accepting the Principle of Planning Low-Income Housing; Dispatching Personnel for Secret Investigation to Prevent Illegal Money Collection <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to fundamentally solve the problem of shacks, had previously suggested that the French Municipal Council plan low-income housing to gradually eliminate shacks and prevent the poor from being displaced. Now, as the French Municipal Council has agreed to this principle, the Federation has sent a letter expressing gratitude and requesting the cancellation of the relocation deadline for shacks to reassure residents. Furthermore, personnel have been dispatched for a secret investigation to prevent unscrupulous individuals from collecting money from the poor. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, upon reading the news on August 5th, it was reported that the First Special District Citizens' Federation, in order to completely solve the problem of low-income housing, had previously written to the French Municipal Council requesting the construction of low-income housing within the French Concession to accommodate the poor. According to a spokesperson from the French Municipal Council, the Council has always paid close attention to the issue of low-income housing within the French Concession. Upon receiving the suggestion from the Chinese side to build low-income housing, it was deemed appropriate and timely. The construction plan has been handed over to the Housing Committee, which is responsible for studying and handling housing issues, for thorough consideration. During the Board of Directors' summer recess, the Committee will conduct a detailed study and then submit a specific plan to the Board of Directors for discussion and resolution. During this year's taxpayers' annual meeting, the French Municipal Council specifically established a Housing Committee, demonstrating its concern for the people's hardships and its emphasis on housing issues. Now, it is extending its benevolence to the common people, which is deeply admirable. Regarding the relocation of shacks, it is heard that the Board of Directors has decided to postpone the relocation date to the cool autumn season. Now that the prior planning of low-income housing is a prerequisite for eliminating shacks, it is requested that the deadline be publicly announced and cancelled to avoid anxiety among shack dwellers. Furthermore, according to reports, there are unscrupulous individuals who are wantonly collecting money from the poor. The Federation is deeply indignant about this and has instructed the investigation department to dispatch personnel for a secret investigation. If there are indeed cases of greed and extortion, the Federation will coordinate with the police authorities to stop them. Addressed to the French Municipal Council of the French Concession.</p>

<p>Yan Yongxiao Requests the Water Police Bureau to Dispatch Elite Police Officers to Arrest the Dagong Society: Yan Yongxiao, director of the Shanghai Joint Office of the Zhejiang Lugang Shipping Industry, reported that ships under his jurisdiction have been repeatedly robbed before and after Jiangyin. Although reports were immediately submitted to the relevant officials, no cases have been solved to date. On the 30th of last month, the Qian Shunxing ship, also under his jurisdiction, was robbed again at midnight. The ship's crew member, Shi Acheng, was shot and injured by the robbers. After the ship returned to Shanghai, it was reported to the joint office. The director of the office, believing that the robberies were repeated and related to the navigation of ships, submitted a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Bureau yesterday, requesting a thorough investigation to reassure ship merchants. The original report is recorded below: Submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Bureau, the report states that bandits are rampant and robberies are repeated, requesting strict investigation and arrest to reassure ship merchants. The office has repeatedly received reports from Jin Shunrui ship, Wu Taixing ship, Zhou Xiangyuan ship, Xin Kaitai ship, Xin Heng ship, Shen Zhengxing ship, Xinhua Xing ship, Qian Shunxing ship, etc., stating that these ships are transporting goods from Shanghai to Nanchang and Zhenjiang. Every midnight, they encounter a small sand boat carrying seven or eight bandits dressed in gray uniforms and wielding weapons. They jump on board under the pretext of inspecting contraband, but in reality, they rob the ships and then leave. In one case, the Qian Shunyu ship was robbed on the 30th of last month, and the ship's crew member Shi Acheng was shot and seriously injured, with the bullet piercing his finger. He is currently being treated at a hospital in Zhenjiang. According to this, the area before and after Jiangyin has always been known for its peace. However, since December of last year, robberies have occurred repeatedly. Furthermore, the robbers are wearing gray uniforms and carrying firearms, daring to act blatantly within the jurisdiction of the army. Whether they are bandits or not is unknown. However, their actions and attire are suspicious. Therefore, it is requested that you, the commander, review and approve this request and promptly dispatch elite police officers to strengthen defenses in the area before and after Jiangyin, especially at midnight. By combating the banditry, ship merchants will be reassured, which would be a great deed. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team.</p>

<p>A young woman named Bao Ruizhen, 26 years old, residing at No. 8 on Pudong Police Station Road, recently filed a lawsuit with the local court against Zhang Shigui, 46 years old, a local residing at No. 1 Huadongfang, Dongchang Road, Pudong, for abandonment after seduction. She claimed that in April of the 24th year of the Republic [1935], she was courted and deceived in every way by the defendant, who used deceptive tactics such as promising to marry her. She fell into his trap, and in October of the same year, they began cohabiting. Recently, he disappeared and neglected her livelihood, which constitutes a violation of Article 294, Paragraph 1, and Article 229, Paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code. The defendant, Zhang Shigui, hired lawyer Cheng Zhengping, who argued that he had never met the plaintiff and had not seduced her into cohabitation. He claimed that the plaintiff was intentionally trying to extort money, falsely reported her household registration at the Pudong sub-bureau's household registration office, and hired a lawyer to demand a huge sum of 3,000 yuan. Then, she used criminal threats. The defendant claimed that he was peaceful by nature, over fifty years of age, and his vitality was weakening, so he would never engage in flirtatious behavior, let alone fraud or seduction.

<p>Lu Wenying, the female flower gambling boss also known as Lu Laoqi, was wanted for two years based on a warrant issued by the French Concession Police to the Special Court No. 2. Lu hid in the Hujia Pavilion of Fahua, West Shanghai. Last winter, she came to Shanghai and went to the Wusheng Hall on Xiyanglou to offer incense to Buddha. She was discovered by the French Concession Police at a friend's house surnamed Yang in Yuren Lane on Yunnan Road. The French Concession Police dispatched detectives together with the Laozha Police to arrest her and transfer her to the Special Court No. 2. The police attorney of the police department filed a public prosecution based on the crime of gambling. After the trial, she was sentenced to two years in prison and fined 1,500 yuan. Lu refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court No. 3. The judgment reduced the prison term by six months, but the fine was still executed according to the original judgment. However, Lu was released on bail of 6,000 yuan after the first trial. After the appeal judgment was finalized, she still claimed to be ill and requested a postponement of execution. The High Court No. 3 issued a warrant to arrest Lu and send her to the Special Prison No. 2 to serve her prison term. A few days ago, Zhu, the acting criminal court judge of the High Court No. 3, held a court session to bring Lu to court and execute the fine, as previously reported in this newspaper. However, Lu was unable to raise funds in prison, so no amount of the fine has been paid. Yesterday morning, acting Judge Zhu held a court session again to bring her to court and continue the execution of the fine. Lu still claimed that she was unable to raise funds and was willing to serve jail time instead. The judge announced that after the court session, the court received an anonymous letter stating that fines were converted to jail time in other cases. However, your case is different from other cases, so it cannot be converted. The court is now giving you a deadline to pay the fine in three installments. The first installment must be paid within ten days, otherwise the court will have its own way to deal with it. Lu heard the announcement, lowered her head, and remained silent. As a result, the court ordered the bailiffs to take Lu away and send her back to prison to serve her sentence.</p>

<p>Due to heavy rains in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the water level at ports such as Chongqing rose sharply. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 5th, the water level has receded. However, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Customs Office learned yesterday morning that the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been affected by the discharge of floodwaters from the upper reaches. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Water Level Surge</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Customs Office learned yesterday morning that the water level in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River has suddenly increased due to the discharge of floodwaters from the upper reaches. The water level in Yichang has suddenly increased by fourteen feet in the past four or five days. The customs office's water level reports from Yichang from the 1st to the 5th are as follows: The water level in Yichang on the 1st was 24 feet 7 inches, on the 2nd it was 23 feet 7 inches, on the 3rd it was 23 feet 4 inches, on the 4th it suddenly rose to 28 feet 4 inches (a sharp increase of 5 feet), and on the 5th the rise was even more rapid, with the water level increasing to 37 feet 5 inches (a sharp increase of 8 feet 9 inches). As of the 6th, the customs office had not yet received a report on the water level.</p>
<p>Downstream Gradually Affected</p>
<p>As for the water level in Hankou in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the customs office's record is still the report from the 1st of this month, with a quantity of 31 feet 2 inches (at the end of last month it was only 29 feet 9 inches), which is also a slight increase. As the floodwaters from Yichang discharge downstream in recent days, it is feared that the water level will continue to increase. It is also learned that the climate in the Yangtze River basin has remained unstable in recent days, so the customs office is paying attention again and will determine appropriate navigation facilities based on the development of the flood situation in the next few days.</p>

The family had not yet arrived, so the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for collection.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Parents Who Love Their Children Should Pay Attention To... Digestive Disorders That Plunder Children's Lives <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— (Shen Zhaoquan)</p>
<p>Digestive disorders are the most common and very dangerous diseases in children. Because those with digestive disorders will inevitably be weakened, various diseases are likely to occur, and they are the source of various diseases. The reason is probably inappropriate food, such as exclusive use of milk to feed children under one year old, and giving difficult-to-digest foods after weaning. Excessive eating can also induce this disease. Therefore, the type and amount of food for children must be paid the most attention!</p>
<p>The symptoms of this disease are not fixed. Mild cases have only very mild diarrhea, which ordinary people generally do not pay attention to, and severe cases can be fatal. The common symptoms are diarrhea, green stools, abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, borborygmus, inability to sleep, etc. In severe cases, the whole body becomes feverish, the amount of food gradually decreases, and the body gradually becomes thin (there are also cases where digestion is impaired, but the amount of food does not decrease, or even increases.)</p>
<p>Digestive disorders in adults are not dangerous, but in children, because the development of the body is not complete, they often take their lives. According to statistics from Western scholars, gastrointestinal diseases account for two-fifths of the causes of death in children. Ordinary people mostly think that digestive disorders in children are the same as those in adults, and they are not very dangerous. Many people underestimate them, leading to the death of children, which is unknown. Can parenting families not be careful?</p>
<h3 id="e177">Safe Therapy for Childhood Diseases <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>

<p>The amount of milk is of great importance to the nutrition and development of children. After childbirth, women often have insufficient milk secretion - or even no drops at all. This is medically called "milk deficiency", the reason may be due to incomplete breast development, or due to disease, or due to chlorosis and anemia and other weak constitution.</p>
<p>OTAMNAM</p>
<p>The treatment should be to make the mother's body have good whole-body nutrition and mental tranquility. It is advisable to eat more foods containing protein. (Or take the drug "Conbour's Sar-Vita-Cell" in the nourishing tonic to make up for the deficiency). Other methods include appropriate exercise, unobstructed bowel movements, and drinking more boiled water, milk, meat soup, etc. Recently, the new milk-producing drug "Mammato" has been used for milk deficiency, and its efficacy is very significant. According to clinical experience, milk secretion is seen to be vigorous, milk is thick, and its nourishing power is greatly increased within three days of taking it. Therefore, breastfed babies are more lively, stronger, and better developed and growing than ordinary babies. Moreover, this product is not only a holy medicine for milk production, but also greatly helps the mother's nutrition.</p>

<p>— Dr. Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>The pathogen of dysentery is caused by a bacterial infection. It is very prevalent in late summer and early autumn. The main symptoms are frequent bowel movements. In a day, there are more than ten bowel movements for few cases, and dozens for many cases. When defecating, there is abdominal pain like twisting. The patient always frowns and grinds his teeth, suffering extremely. The excreted matter may be like glue, like pus, or pure blood. The amount is only a little, and the smell is very bad. In addition, there is vomiting, hiccups, loss of appetite, dry tongue coating, and very little urine. In severe cases, the face is pale, the limbs are cold, the pulse is thin and numerous, the body temperature is low, the voice is hoarse, and the whole body is sore.

<p>— Dr. Xu Shengzhang</p>
<p>Leukorrhea, also known as gonorrhea, is a venereal disease that is most easily transmitted and most widely spread. This disease is not only sufficient to endanger my personal health, but also can cut off the ability to reproduce. According to a recent survey report by new doctors, although there are many people who are extinct today, those caused by this disease account for more than 70%, because the reproductive organs are damaged, so that they cannot conceive. Even if they are fortunate enough to conceive, they are prone to miscarriage or at the end of pregnancy, when the fetus passes through the birth canal, the pathogenic bacteria of leukorrhea in the birth canal are very easy to invade the fetus's eyes, causing leukorrhea purulent conjunctivitis (ie, wind eye), if it is not treated for three days, it will inevitably lead to blindness and lifelong regret. Therefore, the severity of this disease is more than that of syphilis, and it is a terrible disease that can destroy the country.</p>
<p>However, most of my compatriots have little scientific knowledge, and think that it is the lightest of venereal diseases because this disease is not found on the outside of the body. In addition, the general beginners are ashamed to let people know, and do not receive medical treatment, or after receiving medical treatment, they are not cured and stop treatment halfway, or because they purchase unauthorized medicines, resulting in prolonged time, acute to chronic, mild to severe, and the virus ascends to the hall and enters the room, the pain is greater than this. At this time, even if they want to seek treatment, it is difficult. Now, I will briefly describe the health and treatment methods related to wood evidence for the readers. I hope that after reading it, they will widely publicize it, and strive to reduce this disease day by day, and will not completely eliminate this disease. It is also the good fortune of our society.</p>

<p>Havas dispatch from Berlin, 5th: The men's 200-meter final was held this afternoon, with a large audience. Owens won the championship with 20.7 seconds, breaking the Games record (21.6 seconds).</p>
<p>During the 200-meter final, there was a favorable wind, and the wind was quite strong. Owens was assisted by Aeolus. However, he is good at sprinting. After the start, he was always in the lead. His winning the championship was as easy as taking something out of a pocket. Owens' status as the number one sprinter was further confirmed in this final.</p>
<p>(Kuomintang Hai Tong News Agency) Berlin, August 5th: American black sprinter Owens broke the World Games record again in today's 200-meter final. This is the third gold medal Owens has won at the Games. (1) Owens (USA) 20.7 seconds, (2) Robinson (USA) 21.1 seconds, (3) Osendarp (Netherlands) 21.3 seconds.</p>
<p>Owens' success in the 100 meters and long jump has become the focus of attention at this World Games. His fame will never cease to be heroic in sports history. In the 200-meter final, Owens' heroic posture was once again presented to an audience of 100,000. From the start, Owens was in the lead, overwhelming the crowd. European athlete Osendarp made a final effort to make up some distance, but ultimately could not match the American athlete in second place.</p>
<p>The previous World Games record was 21.1 seconds, set by American black athlete Tolan in 1932. The current world record is 20.6 seconds, set by America's Locke in 1926.</p>
<p>Owens won three gold medals in track and field events at the Eleventh World Games, which is unprecedented. Therefore, this alone has become a glorious page in the history of world sports. Finland's Nurmi won four gold medals at the World Games, but Nurmi's were the total achievements of three World Games, so they are different from those won by Owens in one Games.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Pole Vault Final Results, 4.35 Meters, American Athlete Meadows Sets Games Record <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Berlin, 5th: The pole vault final began at 3 p.m. today and lasted until 9 p.m., lasting six hours. Later, it was already late, and the stadium lights were all on, illuminating the stadium as if it were daytime, so that the athletes could still show their skills in the evening. As a result, the champion was an American athlete, followed by Nishida and Ooe. The score was four feet twenty-five. The two competed with American athletes Meadows, Gralund, and Sefton. At first, they were evenly matched, but when it was up to two feet twenty-five, Gralund was exhausted and could not pass. When it was up to 4.35 meters, Sefton and the two Japanese athletes also failed to pass. Only Meadows had the remaining courage to sell, and jumped over it. When it was up to 4.45 meters, Meadows did not pass either, but the difference was only a fraction of an inch, so 4.35 meters was the final score he achieved.</p>
<p>According to the Games record, it was 4.3 meters. 5.1932 was created by American Miller and has been broken. As for the world record of 4.37 meters, it was also created by Gralund (USA) in 1930.</p>
<p>Dōmei News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 5th: The rankings for the pole vault final are below.</p>
<p>This final, held at 4 p.m. on the afternoon of the 5th, was indeed a battle for supremacy between Japan and the United States. When the height reached 4.35 meters, only four athletes from Japan and the United States remained, competing for the final victory in the twilight. American Meadows failed in the first attempt, but jumped over it on the second try, setting a new Games record. Japanese Nishida, Ooe, and American Sefton all failed to cross after three attempts. The supremacy was therefore given to American Meadows. The 40,000 spectators in the stands applauded thunderously and did not stop for a while. After that, the three selected athletes competed for second place. As a result, American Sefton was disqualified, and the two Japanese athletes occupied the second and third places. However, the time had passed the time for the game to stop, and the sun had set. The referees announced the end of the game and judged Sefton in fourth place and Gralund in fifth place.</p>

<p>The Kuomintang Hai Tong News Agency dispatched from Berlin on August 5th: After four days of the World Games, the positions occupied by the participating countries are gradually being revealed. It is still too early to make predictions of victory, but the United States' hegemonic power in the World Games cannot be slightly reduced by the efforts of various countries. On the other hand, Germany's success can be said to be the result of years of continuous effort, while the victories of other countries are still in the future. The second characteristic of this Games is that although British colonies have been cultivated and trained for decades, they have not made any achievements in the Games. Overall, Canada has won one silver medal and two bronze medals.</p>

<p>(2)(6) A Scene in the Red Sea: Tragedy</p>
<p>On the night of the 13th, the mail ship passed through the Gulf of Aden and sailed into the Red Sea. The azure seawater was so calm that it was almost without a ripple. After everyone had suffered through the stormy waves, arriving at such a peaceful state was truly very comfortable.</p>
<p>The Red Sea is over 1,100 miles long, 200 miles at its widest point, and only 16 miles at its narrowest. Both shores are visible. The southern shore of the Red Sea is the Arabian Desert, and the northern shore is the African Desert. Amidst the evaporation of these two great deserts, the climate is extremely hot. It is said that it is because of the heat that it was given the name "Red Sea," but it has absolutely nothing to do with the color of the seawater.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, the sky was azure and clear, and the sun blazed fiercely. Canvas awnings were erected on the deck, but they still could not resist the scorching heat of the sun. The electric fans in the smoking room were turned on at full speed, but even sitting inside, bright beads of sweat flowed like a spring. The breeze blowing over the sea was filled with heat. Everything felt a bit scorching to the touch. In the afternoon, we arrived at Massawa. The ship stopped, and the wind ceased. The heat from the desert evaporated, causing even more headaches and mental fatigue. Amidst such heat waves, it was unimaginable that a tragedy would occur. A Dutchman who worked for the Javanese government was retiring and returning home with his wife, son, and daughter. He boarded the ship from Singapore. This gentleman was about 50 years old, weighed 200 pounds, and had a very amiable and approachable demeanor. We had been on the ship together for more than ten days and were very familiar with each other. In particular, his 15-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son, innocent and lively, played very affectionately with everyone. They also lived in the economical second-class cabins, which were even more stifling as they were near the engine room. On the night of the 14th, he went to the deck to cool off and felt a bit unwell. He returned to his room, and not long after, he suddenly passed away. On the morning of the 15th, everyone heard this tragic news and felt extremely saddened and a sense of the fleetingness of life. According to the ship's regulations, if a passenger dies mid-journey, a burial at sea should be held. At 6 p.m. that afternoon, the ship lowered its flag to half-mast and slowed down. The captain, dressed in formal attire, held a simple memorial service for him, and then the body was placed in a wooden box and slowly lowered into the sea. It is said that there were also four workers on the ship who were victims of the heat wave. Their bodies were quietly thrown into the sea, becoming companions to the waves and buried in the bellies of fish.</p>
<p>(2)(7) Impressions of Massawa</p>
<p>At 2 p.m. on the afternoon of the 14th, the ship arrived at Massawa. Although the sun was blazing and sweat poured down our backs, many people still went ashore to sightsee because this place was an important military base during the Italo-Ethiopian War.</p>
<p>Massawa is the capital of Italian Eritrea and its only commercial port. It is located on the Red Sea coast, serving as a vital transportation hub between Europe and Asia, its importance second only to British Aden and French Djibouti. Eritrea was originally part of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) but was later ceded to Italy. Now, Italy uses Eritrea as a base, and even Abyssinia has been completely annexed. When the Italo-Ethiopian War was in progress, Massawa was the key entry point for Italian troops heading to Africa via the northern route. Now that we are here in person, as we witness the hideous and ferocious face of imperialism, we cannot help but think back to our motherland's fragmented rivers and mountains and the hardships and difficulties of our nation's fate. It truly fills us with shock and dismay. As the mail ship approached the coast of Massawa, we saw from afar many warships and merchant ships anchored there. These warships and merchant ships were all Italian because ships from other countries never dock at Massawa. When the mail ship docked, we saw many colored and colorless laborers, under the command of several officers, busily engaged in transportation work. Dozens of transport vehicles were also traveling back and forth frequently. This clearly shows that although the Italo-Ethiopian War has come to an end, military arrangements are still in full swing.</p>
<p>Massawa can be summarized in two phrases: "a desert area, a military stronghold." The entire town is very small, at most comparable to a slightly larger town in our country. It is entirely built on a desert. The houses are very dilapidated, and the climate is extremely hot. We walked through all the streets and only saw a telegraph office (with a post office attached) and less than ten extremely small shops. Apart from residences, all other buildings are for military use.</p>
<p>The streets are dusty, dirty, and unbearably smelly, making one want to vomit. Apart from a few palm trees, there is no other greenery. Such a desolate place seems unworthy of anyone's attachment, but because it is the gateway to Abyssinia, Italy regards it as the source of life. No wonder our country, with its fertile lands for thousands of miles, is coveted by others.</p>
<p>The skin of the natives is as black as the bottom of a pot, and their appearance is ferocious. Compared to them, the Indians are insignificant. Men and women are bare-chested, wearing only a piece of colored cloth around their lower bodies. Under the command of the colorless race, they lead a laborious life like beasts of burden. Their ignorance and lack of knowledge are evident at a glance. Such a nation can only survive independently if no one seeks to slaughter it. I write this not to advocate for imperialism, but in this era of survival of the fittest, a nation must seek a way to survive. As we witness this stark contrast in Massawa, we think about our own situation and cannot help but feel a chill down our spines.</p>
<p>The mail ship left Massawa at 8 p.m., continuing towards Shanghai. Another 600 passengers boarded the ship. They were all Italian workers who had fulfilled their responsibilities to their country during the Italo-Ethiopian War. Therefore, although they were assigned to third class, they quickly occupied the decks and smoking room of the economical second class. Our athletes barely had a place to stand. Fortunately, there are not many days left in the voyage. It is estimated that we will arrive in Port Said on the 17th and disembark in Venice on the 19th.</p>
<p>(2)(8) Inside the Third Class</p>
<p>In my first letter, I mentioned the dozens of fellow countrymen in the third-class cabins. Yesterday, I visited them. In the filthy steerage and passageways, they had laid a mat on the floor for their long voyage. Compared to them, we are worlds apart.</p>
<p>They all wear short shirts and shorts, representing the epitome of rural life. There are a total of 130 of them, all from Zhejiang, with over 100 from Wenzhou and over 20 from Qingtian. According to them, they are all going to Europe to do business and make a living. They have not yet decided which country to go to. Some will figure it out once they get to Europe. I asked them what kind of business they would do in Europe. Apart from a few who said they brought some tea and other local products, the rest said they would see once they got to Europe. I also asked them why they insisted on going to Europe. Their answer was that they could not make a living in China. However, according to them, each person's travel expenses were at least 400 to 500 yuan. In Chinese society, with 400 to 500 yuan in capital, it is not necessarily impossible to find a way to make a living. Therefore, apart from admiring their masculinity and adventurous spirit, I am truly puzzled by their motives for going to Europe. One person told me that their tickets were purchased through an agent and cost 17 pounds. After boarding the ship, they found out that it only cost 12 pounds. The ship's meals are set at 1 pound per day for two meals, but the mail ship company only gives the cook 8 yuan. According to him, such meals from Shanghai to Venice would cost less than 2 yuan in total. Although this may be an exaggeration, it is an undeniable fact that these wandering, pitiful people are being exploited everywhere.</p>
<p>People from Qingtian have a long history in Europe. It is said that at the end of the Guangxu era, a person from Qingtian secretly brought some stones, a special product of Qingtian, to France and surprisingly made a fortune. After that, one person told another, and more and more people went. At its peak, there were as many as 30,000 to 40,000 people in all of Europe. There are still 30,000 people now. Some are fortunate enough to start a family and build a career abroad, but most drift in foreign lands, and their lives are still hopeless. Therefore, they will do anything. They have created many jokes abroad and left many stains on the national image. The embassies and consulates in various European countries are constantly trying to send them back to China, but the adventurous Qingtian people are still going in batches, one after another. For this newly emerging force, I can only pray that the goddess of fortune will always be with them, preserving a bit of dignity for our country. (Sent from Port Said on July 17)</p>

Detailed plans for selection and training will be determined separately by the Ministry of Education." Upon receiving this, it is understood that the training of teachers for compulsory education and mass education and the training of personnel who organize the training of teachers for compulsory education and mass education are extremely important for the implementation of compulsory education and mass education and should be actively carried out.

<p>— Written by Professor Mei Gordon, Educator at New York University, USA Translated by Liu Wufu</p>
<p>The economic activity report of the Nianer Cooperative in Jinjiaxiang Village illustrates the specific function of this plan. The workers in this area are mostly textile, laundry, planting, rattan craft, and hand-textile cooperative workers. Among the workers in the hand-textile cooperative, there are 20 old and two young women engaged in hand-spinning, which was forgotten by the invention of new textiles. The rattan craft cooperative is located in a member's home, where work is carried out under the management of a skilled worker. Adults only work in the evenings, while children engage in the actual work of making rattan tools during the day, or engage in reading, games, sports, storytelling, and other common gatherings. The planting cooperative manages 40 acres of farmland, with 25% of the farmland planted with wheat and the rest planted with vegetables. They have used scientific methods to improve seeds and implement crop rotation, and they have also implemented insect management. The laundry cooperative has more than 150 households, and the laundry washed is supplied by the college students participating in the cooperative. To continue to engage in this work, one must study the designated coursework.</p>
<p>The members of the nearby Nianer Cooperative have several fixed plans. They hold general assemblies at fixed times, renovate roadside houses, improve public health, report and discuss current events, and handle temporary medical diagnoses, etc. They have established public contracts, do not believe in religion, do not spend money on superstition, and learn to read and write five new characters every day. They get up in the morning and work and have breakfast in a very orderly manner.</p>
<p>It is clear that this kind of education plan is what the Chinese people need. The cultural education level of the founders of the Nianer Movement is the same as that of the intellectual class in the United States. They are leaders, they instruct the people, and they become models for modern students. They also indicate the needs of the Chinese people. We Americans have long known this from Pearl Buck's novels. The Chinese people are mostly farmers. They live in the countryside, and each person only has an income of 30 to 40 yuan per year. Their lives only rely on the simplest and most frugal standard of living. Western education not only exceeds their needs and understanding, but also exceeds their economic awareness. Due to the rapid import of Western education, the damage to society is already evident in some places. This plan is a good foundation because it plans for the development of the entire nation and is carried out gradually.</p>
<p>The development of the Nianer Movement is worth our attention. It is engaged in strong construction based on the good route of progressive education. Its use is based on the methods of individual needs and interests. For example, workers engaged in rattan tools can be used as the basis for mathematics education, and the quality of the harvest can be introduced into the study of the properties and effects of light. This movement is outdoor, and it stipulates that students participate in the practical work of public socio-economic life, using economic activities to connect cultural and social education. This has spread rapidly. The movement, which was established just three years ago, has spread to six provinces and established 105 cooperative organizations and other organizations, with 21,520 members. Undoubtedly, this rural education movement has been closely watched by the Central Ministry of Education. Their work on the transformation of Chinese society will arouse the interest of the whole world. (Translated from this year's June issue of "Asia" magazine)</p>

<h3 id="e213">After the Removal of Grain Price Limits, Flour Prices Increase Wildly by Ten Cents <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a new situation. The exchange was ordered to remove price limits, and the January prices were opened as scheduled. However, the market had been sluggish for a month, and the rise in foreign wheat prices was drastic. Therefore, the market situation, after a sharp jump, could not avoid speculation from outside the industry. Forward prices rose by six to eight cents. Canadian prices recently rose by one yuan, and forward prices rose by eight to nine cents. Therefore, most people were unanimously enthusiastic. However, the opening price for this month was still reasonable, with an initial price of only one dime and four cents, rising to four cents and seven and a half mils, only three cents higher than the previous day. Unexpectedly, the opening price for September immediately rose by six cents, and then rose another one and a half cents. Therefore, the October price wildly increased by one dime (the exchange stipulates that the daily rise and fall cannot exceed the previous day's closing price). The November and December prices also rose by one dime each, without any other opening prices. Because there was still absorption from outside the industry, the rise moved forward without any looking back. The January price was the first time it started and had reached 3.4075 yuan. At the beginning of the second session, the price for this month wildly rose to 3.20 yuan. Later, the bulls exited, gradually falling back by two to three cents. The September price remained high, only half a cent away from the one-dime limit. The October and November prices rose to the limit, without any movement. The January price was released on a broad scale and also fell back by two to three cents. The wild and special development of the flour market cannot be predicted by common sense.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Wheat Futures Rise Sharply Following the Flour Market, Japanese Merchants Still Purchasing Spot Goods <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, the prices for all months rose by five, seven, or eight cents due to the repeated rebound in foreign wheat prices. The briskness of the transactions and the frenzy of buying were rare recently. After the second session, the price for this month did not continue to surge due to large-scale continuous exits by profitable bulls due to the sharp rise in the flour market. The January price had fewer chips and also increased by seven to eight cents. In the spot wheat market, due to the continued rise in foreign wheat prices, Japanese merchants continued to purchase. The price of high-quality wheat increased by another six to seven cents, medium and secondary quality by three to five cents. Shandong Yaowan wheat opened at 4.80 yuan, Wuxi wheat at 4.71 yuan, Huaian wheat at 4.73 yuan, secondary to six cents, Puzhen wheat at 4.62-3 yuan, Suqian wheat at 4.77 yuan, Daqiao wheat at 4.65 yuan, Hankou wheat at 4.45 yuan, secondary to two cents, vehicle wheat at 4.67 yuan, secondary to five cents, Hefei wheat at 4.70 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.60 yuan, and Caishi wheat at 4.64 yuan. Shenda went out for 1,000 bags. Japanese merchants purchased slightly less yesterday, only opening Hankou wheat for over 1,000 bags, with the price opening at 4.65 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market turned sluggish again, while the source of supply was active. New early rice also continuously arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, another 600 bags of new Wenzhou machine rice arrived, with the price opening at 9.03 yuan. Due to the imminent influx of new rice, cargo owners and hoarders were even more eager to sell, while local buyers were not eager to buy. The market immediately weakened by a few cents to a dime or so. Compared to the highest price two or three days ago, it has decreased by a dime to two dimes. Although oil and northern gangs inquired, these two gangs only purchased 300 bags of Hunan Jinglai rice. The mainland only purchased 240 bags of Shashi rough rice and hundreds of bags of secondary Jiangxi late rice. Local demand was also weak, with total transactions of less than 3,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Du Jian Rice Price Falls, Sales Slightly Brisk <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various sources was more than before, with a total of 25 to 26 boats and over 5,000 shi of goods. Local sales were flat, and only Wei Hai Shu and other gangs purchased over 600 bags of thin paddy rice. Therefore, the market situation was difficult to turn around and remained flat and weak. In addition to the slightly supportive fresh, high-quality early japonica rice, medium and stored rice depreciated by about a dime. The thin paddy rice remained unchanged. After the price of Du Yang Jian rice fell completely, sales were slightly more brisk, so the price increased by one or two chǐ. Yinyang rice, due to shortages and brisk sales, also rose by one dime. Shenda and Dongxin machine rice arrived with a total of ten shi, and the price remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 15 to 16 boats arrived from various routes downstream. High-quality white japonica and Yang Jian rice had some transactions, medium quality rice was slightly sluggish, and thin paddy rice was scarce and still good. The remaining goods were stagnant. The market price of high-quality white refined rice was barely maintained, and medium quality rice was weak by a few cents to a dime or so. Yang Du, Bu Ke, Jian Yuan, and other types of rice were all soft, decreasing by a few cents to nearly a dime. Thin paddy rice was firm. 7.5 shi of Dongxin refined rice arrived, and the price rose by two dimes compared to the previous market, opening at 11 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Cotton Yarn Prices: Japanese Merchants Covering Short Positions, Cotton Prices Rebounding Strongly, But Cotton Merchants Still Selling <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Cotton prices have been steadily declining, but yesterday there was a slight rebound, mainly because some cotton fields were feared to be affected by damp weather, boosting confidence. Some short positions were covered, and market prices were firm. However, general cotton merchants, due to the expansion of cotton stocks, are said to be pessimistic about future prices.</p>
<p>Up Six Jiao This Month Alone</p>
<p>The cotton market opened with a near-term weakness because of the sharp drop in American cotton prices, followed by a slight rebound, rising by a small margin of five to nine points. Spot prices rebounded only slightly by four points. Indian cotton rose only 0.25 to 1 rupee. Osaka's Three Grades of Cotton rebounded by 3.4.6 jiao. Market confidence did not appear weak. Forward contracts were actively traded. Near-month contracts jumped by three jiao in the second session, due to many traders covering short positions, and it was said that Japanese merchants were covering. However, cotton merchants competed to sell, and the market was able to maintain stability. As a result, all months rose by 2.5 to 3.4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, but August rose by six jiao. Sold: Mei Ji 2,400 dan, Da Feng 3,000 dan, Yuan Da 1,400 dan, Ming De 2,100 dan, Rui Da 2,300 dan, Xing Chang 1,700 dan, Sen Kang 1,400 dan, Chang Feng 1,500 dan, Tong He 1,300 dan, Xin Cheng 2,000 dan, Chang He 2,000 dan.

<h3 id="e218">Standard Yarn Cheaper Than Spot Goods: Yarn Market Showing Signs of Recovery Yesterday, Bulls Not Entirely Emerging, Market Price Rising by More Than One Yuan <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>After several days of sharp decline, the yarn market showed signs of recovery yesterday, and the situation stabilized slightly. In fact, the sharp drop of 16 or 17 yuan compared to the high price attracted profit-takers to cover their positions. At the same time, spot yarn sales were still maintained. As standard yarn prices are cheaper than spot yarn, the rebound occurred abruptly after the decline stabilized. However, bullish companies emerged one after another with huge volumes, and with new cotton soon to be on the market, there were even more who were bearish on the yarn market.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Market Turns Tight</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened with a slight increase in each month. After the sharp drop in Blue and above, it triggered profit-takers to cover their short positions, rising by five to seven jiao. However, as forward contracts were traded, bullish traders came out to sell again, and the selling pressure was strong, turning weak, falling by three to five jiao. After the second session, due to the strength of raw cotton, the Three Grades of Yarn market hardened, and the market became tighter, with prices rising slowly. As a result, each month rose by seven jiao to one yuan and four jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. Sold: De Da 1,100 bales, Da Fu 3,050 bales, Yu Da 800 bales, Da Feng 1,350 bales, Ming De 3,850 bales, Geng Feng 1,350 bales, Yong Yu 950 bales, Rui Da 950 bales.

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with each month rising by one to three points. Private cotton estimates varied greatly, causing buyers to wait and see, and the market was stagnant. In the early morning, the Liverpool news was good, and there was a lack of rain in Oklahoma. Traders bought in, and there were few sellers, so the market price rose. Later, because the weekly weather report was favorable, bulls closed their positions, and local traders sold, turning weak. Before the close, short positions were covered, and the market rebounded again. Spot prices fell by four points, while futures rose by six to nine points. British spot cotton fell by three points, and futures rose by three or four points. Indian cotton initially rose due to lack of rain and purchases by European exporters and speculators, but later declined due to sales by operators. Píng Guǒ Ér rose by 0.75 rupees, Ào Mǔ Lā was unchanged, and Bái Luó Xī rose by 0.25 to 0.5 rupees. According to a telegraphic report (dated the 5th).</p>

The HSBC posted exchange rates showed both British and American markets flat, and although the silver balance tax rose by 0.25, it had no special impact.

<p>Yesterday, on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, due to the selling of numbers 33 and 52, and number 52 even turning to buying, the movements of large traders were uncertain, and market sentiment also became chaotic. Rumors circulated in the market that the Fuxing public debt was about to be launched. Number 15, which had no major transactions, suddenly saw a large amount of buying, number 52 turned from selling to buying, and number 33 no longer emerged. However, number 10 continued to sell incessantly. However, yesterday's pledges were all sold at limited prices, which was relatively slower. Number 10 was formerly number 78, with extremely large transactions, so even if the future does not rise, it will only fluctuate. In yesterday's proceedings, retail investors sold at the beginning of the opening, and Ding category bonds were quite weak, but they were stabilized by the absorption of number 15. After that, the market was seen to turn firm and rise. Numbers 4, 10, and 16 all sold, while numbers 34, 47, and 53 all bought. Ding category bonds all rose, and A category bonds rose the most by six jiao. In the second session, the market rose across the board, but it was firm rather than active, mostly up by about one or two jiao. As a result, market prices rebounded across the board by two jiao to eight jiao. The total transaction volume was 4,495,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>The purpose of the Jin Cai Company, since its establishment, has been to seek mutual benefit for the industry, but it has not been even a month since it was established. Now, due to differing opinions among the various firms, it has been decided to dissolve the company from yesterday, and each firm will continue to operate independently. Unexpectedly, as soon as the company was dissolved, the prices of goods from the numbered firms immediately became firmer. Yesterday, the city market opened with prices such as Da Xing Cai opening at 19.5 yuan to 18.5 yuan, up about one yuan from the previous price. The various firms all rushed to purchase, and the market势势 was greatly boosted. Subsequent defense was tight.</p>

<p>After the Lanxi white lotus production price rebounded by one yuan, the market suddenly turned down yesterday. According to telegraphic reports, it has fallen to 44-45 yuan, down about 3-4 yuan. The trend seems to be due to an increase in the number of goods coming onto the market. The rebound in the market was actually a temporary squeeze, and it may continue to decline in the future.</p>

The current market price is: large dried clams from Jian are 90 yuan, small are 80 yuan, large and medium clams from Andong are 52 yuan, medium are 42 yuan, medium clams from Yantai are 37 yuan, medium clams from Huaihe are 40 yuan, and lower grade are 32 yuan. Bamboo clams from Jiangbei are 30 yuan to 25-26 yuan. If the goods continue to arrive, the market prices in the various markets are expected to fall.</p>
<p>35 packages of new second grade squid from Duidong arrived yesterday. The goods were damp and soft, the slices were not very large, and they were only of medium quality. The list price was 84 yuan, and they were distributed and sold by the various firms. Improved Duidong squid was sold at 85 yuan. The new goods of Xiangguan squid have not yet arrived at the port, and there are few Chen Qiushui goods in stock, currently selling at 89 yuan, and the market trend is firm. Large slices of high-quality Jinshan bucket squid are 83 yuan, and mixed are 81-82 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Sales Limited to a Corner, More Additions in the Yangtze River Basin, Fewer and Fewer Routes to North China <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>Although yarn and cotton prices suddenly rebounded yesterday, due to the strong cotton production and the large amount of yarn in stock, the trend of yarn and cotton futures was weak. Although cotton cloth sales were very good, they were only limited to a corner. The Sichuan, Yangtze River, and Shaanxi routes saw slight increases, while the northern routes (Tianjin, Yantai, etc.) saw sharp decreases. The Japanese merchants' efforts to focus on North China have already been implemented, and the number of goods going to the northern route is decreasing day by day. Among the few goods going north, the woven flannel from the factories accounts for the most. Yesterday, the prices of various types of cloth were stable. Fine twill from the factories fell slightly by about 5 cents per piece. Traders shipped 50-60 packages of fine twill (Red Lily, Jiaguan brands, etc.), 40-50 packages of fine cloth, woven flannel, Zhigong, and flower velvet, etc., and over 100 pieces of other goods. Traders shipped over 10 boxes of fine and plain woven flannel and Zhigong to the Sichuan route. The various ports along the Yangtze River continued to add goods, but business in the inland areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang was the most sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Goods Lacking in Arrival, Yuanfang Piece Goods Quite Firm and Expensive <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 301st auction of Yuanfang. There were four types of goods on display: Western satin, Yuan Yu silk, Yuan velvet, and Gong cloth, totaling 35 brands and 52 boxes. There were originally seven types of goods such as red and blue cloth, bleached fine cloth, white yarn, and Yuan white silk, but they were not included due to a lack of arrival. Most of the auction prices were higher than in the previous period. Jiuyingqi was added to the Western satin, and because it had not been included for a long time, merchants competed to buy it, and the price was particularly outstanding. The price of each yard of the other brands increased by 3 cents, Yuan velvet and Zhigong each increased by 4 cents, the price of the Andian brand added to the Yuan Yu silk was still outstanding, Diexian brand rose by 8 jiao and 25 cents, and the others fluctuated by about 2 jiao, but there were more increases than decreases.</p>
<h3 id="e230">Woolen Cloth Customers Gradually Starting to Move <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>The woolen cloth market has been sluggish in this street recently, but the demand from customers has been quite strong, especially the Shanghai offices of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Changsha, which have been purchasing more frequently. Transactions have been active in the warehouses of Yi Ji, Xie Ji Xing, Hui Ji Xing, Xiang Yu Gong, Da Chuan Tong, Zhi Chang Xiang, Tai Gu Yu, Yi Xin, Fu He, Ju Yuan Fang, and Taiping Fang. Yuan silk velvet camel hair, shoe felt, Mao Di, melanite plain thick cloth, suit cloth, domestic wool cloth, woven flannel, Zhigong, and Tete cloth have all been negotiated and traded at standard prices.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Quotes Lower, Shanghai Silk Trading Becoming More and More Sluggish <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk prices, except for Lyon which was relatively firm (Lyon Japanese silk rose by 2 francs, Shanghai silk A character remained at the original price, B character rose by half a franc, Guangdong silk was unchanged), the prices of silk in New York and Yokohama all fell. New York September fell by 1.5 points, far-term futures fell by 0.5 points, Japanese silk was 83.75, Shanghai silk was 78 even, and Guangdong silk all fell by 1 point. Yokohama spot fell by 10 yuan, futures fell by 11 yuan. Silk sales in the central port became more sluggish. Yesterday, only Xinfu foreign firm entered Jili Qian Jing 15 dan, users entered Chuanlu Jing 18 dan. Other white factories, etc., had high silk prices, and there were few transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Needle Eyebrow Green Tea Sales to Europe Turn Active, Chezhen Price Drop Stimulates Sales <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's green tea market situation was mixed. The needle eyebrow green tea from the Lailu estates, especially those with inferior body quality, suddenly became active in sales. Yihe, Xiehe, Jinlong, and Tongfu, etc., all bought in large quantities, with a total transaction volume of over 800 boxes, priced at 16 yuan to 20 yuan. However, the trading of Zhenmei green tea was still sluggish, and the market continued to fall by 3-4 yuan. As for Qining black tea, there were not many sales. Only Huaxiang was purchased by Yihe foreign firm in succession for over 500 boxes, with no price increase or decrease.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, there have been no formal transactions of Zhenmei from various routes for more than ten days. After the slight price drop of Zhenmei yesterday, trading moved slightly. Baolong purchased about 500 boxes, and Tianyu purchased over 100 boxes, both priced at 61 yuan, about 6-7 yuan lower than before. Other Zhenmei transactions were still few. Qiantian entered 60 boxes of Tunzhen, priced at 72 yuan. Baochang continued to enter goods from Duishui Men of Haichao, priced between 112 and 114 yuan. A certain large Ping Shui brand was still stagnant, and retail transactions were also sluggish. However, low-grade Zhucha with rolled ends and Chinese tea had over 400 boxes purchased, priced at 18 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Hardware: Narrow Strip Tinplate Is Being Searched for Actively <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>Since narrow strip tinplate has been used by cigarette factories and can factories, the spot goods on the market have decreased significantly. Small can factories and printing factories use this product for the bottom and lid of small cans, so they are also competing to buy it. The market price has increased from 23.5 yuan to 24.5 yuan per box. If single large-size stocks are priced, they are opened at 27-28 yuan or more. Overseas orders are also very scarce.</p>

<h3 id="e244">From Tongguan to Shouyang Mountain <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>By: Zongren</p>
<p>Standing by the Yellow River, on the mountain at Fengling Ferry, overlooking the opposite bank, the entire city of Tongguan seems to be displayed at the bottom of your eyes. Starting from that cluster of red houses at the Longhai Railway Station, the trees along the road stretch out like smoke and clouds, running through the ancient city, towering into distant mountains, and disappearing into a mountain cave that seems to be there and yet isn't.</p>
<p>Further away, thirty miles from Tongguan, is Mount Hua. The Five Elders Peaks stand verdant in the clouds and mist, and the temples on the mountainside are still faintly discernible. At the foot of Tongguan is the Yellow River, with its turbulent rapids; from time to time, the sound of splashing water and the shouts of the old boatmen on the ferry quietly rise up; in the lonely mountain bay, it seems to evoke an air of slumber.</p>
<p>Fengling Ferry is only thirty miles from Shouyang Mountain by mountain road. We took a ferry from Tongguan, and boarded a car that had been pre-arranged at the dock, and the journey only took forty minutes. But in these forty minutes, the encounters with reality and the nostalgic feelings, if one were a poet, would truly require dozens of poems to describe. I thought of Li Bai composing poetry in this place after getting drunk in the past, and I couldn't help but feel some silent emotion.</p>
<p>There is no particularly obvious distinction at this border of Shanxi and Shaanxi. If one thinks about it in detail: one can smell the scent of opium in the streets of Tongguan; one can see the dominoes game of "Ten-Nine" and fine porcelain teacups blocking the streets. But upon entering Shanxi territory, all of these change their appearance. For example, opium is renamed "medicinal cake" and issued in small quantities; gambling tools are hidden at the bottom of cabinets and sold secretly. Such is the case!</p>
<p>The atmosphere in both places feels the same.</p>
<p>This time, our trip was sponsored by the Tongpu Railway Bureau, so the car followed the base of the Tongpu Railway the whole time. And the base of the Tongpu Railway mostly relies on the Yellow River - going down, it relies on the banks of the Fen River.</p>
<p>According to the receptionist sent by the Railway Bureau, the entire Tongpu South Railway is scheduled to open to traffic on October 10th. Therefore, the construction is being accelerated everywhere. More and more troops transferred from various places are participating in the road construction.</p>
<p>The car climbed up a mountain and then drove straight down. The situation was like plunging into the vast Yellow River, which greatly increased people's sense of adventure and made us cry out in fright from time to time. Along the way, solitary stone statues standing on layers of cliffs, or even collapsed in front of ruins, greatly increased our interest.</p>
<p>Therefore, even though we were traveling on a hot day, we didn't feel tired at all, and time slowly slipped away in everyone's shouts of surprise and sighs of emotion! The car stopped surprisingly quickly at the foot of Shouyang Mountain.</p>
<p>We expected to stop at Shouyang Mountain for an hour or two. Because this place is an important station for the military to build roads, and it is also the place that our news photography team must film.</p>
<p>But our work did not go very smoothly. The soldiers and officers building the road all advocated caution when it came to including them in the photographs. They said that they were not prepared beforehand, so their clothes were not neat. "If it's not neat, what will it look like when it's photographed? It will damage our reputation. Let's wait until we change our clothes in the afternoon before taking pictures. Please sit down and rest first!" The deputy regiment commander in charge of road construction insisted. As a result, our work had to be delayed somewhat. But everyone was unwilling to accept their hospitality, hoping to use this free time to visit the "Two Worthies Shrine" that was so familiar in our memories.</p>
<p>Shouyang Mountain is not high, and the area it occupies is not large. And it looks sparse, without even a decent forest. It is somewhat bald and tailless, like a declining ruined household. But because there are historical sites to be found, everyone no longer finds its poor and sour face hateful.</p>
<p>Halfway up the mountain, next to the car road, there are two not very tall pagodas. A rock next to the pagodas is engraved with the words "Tomb of Bo Yi and Shu Qi" carved in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Bending around behind this pagoda, on a desolate grassy area behind the mountain, is the real Two Worthies Shrine.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is because people today do not respect the ancients, but the shrine has already fallen into disrepair, leaving only a few dilapidated temple buildings. And those temple buildings are now occupied by the headquarters of the [Number] Corps of the [Army]. The memorial arch in front of the shrine, like the withered cypress trees, looks very unpromising. As for the stone figures and stone horses, most of them are missing heads and legs, or even only half of them, squatting in the sand.</p>
<p>Next to the shrine, in a courtyard buried in weeds, are the graves of the two brothers. Bo Yi is at the top, and Shu Qi is at the bottom. Only one cypress tree in the entire shrine stands alone on Bo Yi's grave. According to legend, this is also for "righteousness." Shu Qi could not leave his elder brother, so he let a tree on his grave die and attach itself to his elder brother's grave. But it seems that the tree is very small, like a newborn, so this kind of legend about moral integrity is very questionable.</p>
<p>"Ignorance is great righteousness" all the inscriptions contain this meaning. I think the philosophy of Bo Yi and Shu Qi probably suited their intentions very well. Because that method of resistance of not eating Zhou millet, even to the point of starving to death, is, in the eyes of some people, the most suitable.</p>
<p>It was still early, so everyone left the Two Worthies Shrine and walked to the village on the mountainside. Most of the houses in this village were hidden under ancient trees. The strange thing is that there did not seem to be a single man in this village, only some women and dogs with their tails between their legs, hiding behind the women, staring at our intrusion with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>Because of our curiosity, we all broke into a private school. There were only some children in the private school, shaking their heads and reciting "Confucius said", and they all stopped when they saw us!</p>
<p>"Where is your teacher?"</p>
<p>"The teacher ran away!"</p>
<p>"He went to build the road!"</p>
<p>Only then did the receptionist from the Railway Bureau suddenly realize and explain to us:</p>
<p>"Oh, wherever the project goes, the government not only buys the people's land, but also sends the nearby residents to work. Their teacher was probably conscripted to work."</p>
<p>"What about the money? Is there any money? The money for the land and the wages for the work!"</p>
<p>"There is, but I don't know when we'll get it?"</p>
<p>The receptionist said meaningfully.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Melancholy <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— By Karel Čapek (Czech)</p>
<p>A moment ago, you were chatting and joking, everything making you feel interested and happy. Now you are staring at the ground; you want to pray, but you don't know why or to whom. Sadness, fatigue, indifference. You find it strange that just a few minutes ago you felt happy about everything, and even stranger that you have to get up tomorrow and do your work. And worst of all, your throat feels tight, you seem to be carrying a heavy burden on your back, and your eyes are like lead, so you can't lift them from the ground.</p>
<p>What happened to you? Nothing, really nothing. Just one or two trivial, unpleasant things. Like something blocking my way, but it's insignificant—something unexpected, something that hurt me a little. I can't drive it from my mind. In fact, it's nothing when you put it all together; it's not even enough to be a legitimate reason for sorrow, even if you add it all up. It's nothing, but put together, it's a bit too much—actually, it's still insignificant, but you know life is a terrible thing.</p>
<p>I envy that day when Solomon wrote that pessimistic creed—when he wrote, "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity"—that day, nothing special had happened to him; his kingdom hadn't fallen, his beloved wife hadn't died, and he didn't feel death approaching in his ailing body. In fact, Solomon didn't encounter anything that day! But perhaps he sensed foolishness and cunning in his beloved wife's eyes, indifference in his friends, and baseness in his servants. Or maybe he lost something, something perhaps utterly insignificant; or a project of his failed, something disappointed him; he saw many events as slightly dimmer than usual, the people were baser and more annoying, and life was more difficult. All this really amounts to nothing if you put it all together. But Solomon that day was struck and trembled under the weight of these irrelevant things; tired to death, he wrote in his book, "All is vanity."</p>
<p>Because, you must understand, in the face of profound blows of fate, one cannot be a hero. Death, ruin, shipwrecks, some say, can be endured with a stiff upper lip; at the very end, one can still struggle before dying. But one can never be a hero in the face of a pinprick. You can actually not care about being pricked more than twice; and you can barely endure these few more times without caring; but after being pricked ten or fifteen times, all your heroism will slip away. Man is helpless against small pains. He can feel pride in losing a leg, but he feels no pride when he breaks a fingernail. He can endure the death of his wife with indifference, but he cannot heroically endure her stupid, commonplace ordinariness. He may have some consolation in the event of disaster, if his house collapses, but he has no consolation if his house is extremely simple.</p>
<p>Melancholy, the most serious suffering in life, is a pain caused by small reasons. It is serious because it does not yield to heroic actions; there are no heroic victims of melancholy. In any case, it is a weakness, or more precisely, a state of helplessness in the face of small misfortunes.</p>
<p>I would even say that there are hardly any tragedies in modern times. Take Ibsen: his modern tragedies (even including his *Ghosts*) are actually comedies of melancholy; the tragedy of the heroes in the plays is due to the fact that they are pitiful characters, inevitably heading down the path of misfortune, and because of this, they are fundamentally comical. Classical heroes rebel against the will of the gods, which is tragic; modern heroes rebel against human affairs, which is somewhat comical, but mainly miserable. Shakespeare's heroes often die, a conclusion that saves them from unwanted absurd actions. Modern heroes mostly continue to live, which makes them both comical and pitiable. If Othello hadn't killed himself, but it was discovered that he had conditions that mitigated his crime of murder, and he could even live his old age like a retired general, receiving half a pension, he would become a modern hero—that is, a melancholy, discounted hero. That is why one must create a massacre at the end of the play to write a true tragedy. It is not death itself that is tragic and sublime, but that after that, your hero can no longer do anything to undermine his heroic actions.</p>
<p>To be overwhelmed with suffering is a melancholy thing. If there is such a thing as modern heroism, it should not be a heroic death, but heroic optimism. But modern drama has not yet reached this level. (Translated by Luo Wei)</p>
<h3 id="e246">Yangtze River Night Tide <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— By Chao Yi</p>
<p>I was silent, and he was silent too.</p>
<p>The night was black. I couldn't see his face or hands, but I could still see him clearly. His eyes, darker than the night, were open beside me.</p>
<p>Those were his eyes, indifferent and slightly melancholy when still; otherwise, they changed unfairly, flashing with pain, anger, despair, and the color of a desperate battle. In this black abyss, a world of unbreakable suffering was built; but when you yourself are in pain, you can see that its pain is sharper than yours, so sharply that you feel a little less lonely and get some warmth. But it itself is not warm; it only warms your pain with pain and saves your despair with anger. At that time, I was trapped in extreme desolation and suffering. By chance, I broke into this realm. I don't know, maybe this is what I dreamed of. Anyway, I stayed. I have been there for a long time, but I never hope to be familiar with it, and I can never recognize its true color. In it, I often feel a stinging sensation, and sometimes I smell blood and death. But I can't walk away. It's a disease, stubbornly staying in the middle of suffering, and it has become a disease that I can't cure.</p>
<p>I often feel that this is unreasonable. Why break in and disturb this world?</p>
<p>The eyes open beside me seem a little different from usual. They are still resentful, and tired, but still uneasy; this black world looks even bigger to the point of being boundless, and deeper to the point of having no bottom. Suddenly hot, suddenly frozen. Wrapping me, completely isolating me from the outside world. In the black depths, the sounds of wind and water gradually rang out, releasing the fragrance of grass and trees. I suddenly felt a sweet dizziness. I understood a little that this was just a world of illusion, which would soon disappear. But I still closed my eyes and grabbed it, begging it to let me breathe a little more of this near-death happiness.</p>
<p>The sounds of wind and water gradually rang out, from blurred to clear, gradually approaching from a distance. I couldn't tell whether this was an illusion or reality. So I asked him:</p>
<p>"What sound?"</p>
<p>"The tide."</p>
<p>It was the tide, whistling and rolling in from afar. I took off my shoes and stepped down to the ground, tiptoeing to open the window leading to the terrace. The terrace faced the滔滔(towering) river, making it easy to look at the distant water and smoke. As soon as the window opened, the wind came in first, followed by the rushing sound of water. The tide was like a white snake, dragging its tired and angry steps from afar, crashing onto the shore, and making a 呯嗙 (peng bang) desperate cry.</p>
<p>Under the dim light of the sky, boats with their sails full slipped across the water like dreams.</p>
<p>I was buried in the sounds of wind and water, buried in the沉鬱(melancholy) dimness, buried in the 呯嗙 (peng bang) desperate cry. I couldn't tell where I was and where was the world outside me.</p>
<p>"　　, come." A voice called to me.</p>
<p>It was probably the sound of the tide.</p>
<p>"Come!" It shouted again after a while.</p>
<p>Not the tide. Those black eyes were looking at me.</p>
<p>We all didn't speak, quietly listening to the howling of the wind and the impact of the water. I understood that the tide hated this land and wanted to wash it away and swallow it.</p>
<p>Gradually, the tide, the black eyes, and I all merged into one sound.</p>
<p>The sky was slowly lighting up.</p>
<p>I always hear the sounds of wind and water, but people don't allow me to speak. Okay, I won't speak: but I can still hear it.</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Silent Witness <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— By Long Gong</p>
<p>"He is a silent one."</p>
<p>Xu Jia—a very close friend of mine, said this. He left me a roll of newspapers and walked away. It was the Shen Bao. Following his instructions, I found the news in the "Local News" column: An unnamed coolie man, around forty years old, died in a cement tile pipe placed by the Public Works Department on an open space on Route Massenet in the French Concession because he had no place to live due to illness and slept there at night. He was seriously ill and died in the tile pipe, and no one noticed, causing the corpse to become fat and rotten, and the ozone was overflowing...</p>
<p>Such a clear description of social reality is rarely seen in newspapers. I put it down and wrapped a small book, placing it on the rattan shelf, but unintentionally found that the news was still shining brightly in front of me. I didn't fold it so it wouldn't be exposed.</p>
<p>It was a fat, rotten corpse steamed by the summer heat, hiding in a tile pipe and not saying a word. Around it was bright sunshine. Regarding everything about it, it refused to tell us. Had it struggled? Did it have anything to tell us when it was dying? Didn't the people related to it know about its fate?—No one can know. Tomorrow, this old newspaper will be placed in the waste paper pile, and then it will be forgotten by people, in a calmness without regret or sigh, and it will be forever disconnected from humanity. The matter is very simple.</p>
<p>But the non-simple place can be placed on that assumption. That assumption is that a person's birth and death, an individual's existence or disappearance, is closely related to the disasters, happiness, or progress and decline of all mankind; from the news of the death of one or several individuals, we can often observe the fate of mankind and speculate on the positive and negative mileage of its culture and the period of its collapse. If that is the case, my friend Xu Jia and I were moved for a reason.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, such a thing is just like seeing a dead mouse on the road. Even if you scream and avoid it, there is no emotion. I believe that is the reaction of some people. From the beginning, they treat even a living, nameless coolie the same way, either seeing him as a born slave or as a lowly compatriot.</p>
<p>But some people will see this corpse as a symbol of humanity's barbarism and shame, thinking it is the bone residue spat out by villains, the excrement after their brothers were swallowed by demons, and the aiming star for measuring their future destiny. Therefore, they will never forget it, mentioning it in all conversations and arguments—so that it will exist for several centuries, more long-lived than the corpses of Egyptian royalty. This is also entirely possible.</p>
<p>I think it is not that we abandoned him. I ask, who among us has the courage to abandon the survival of others? It was he who abandoned us. He had a stronger body and more courage than us. Doing more work, yet he abandoned us.</p>
<p>This is our shame. It proves our selfishness, hesitation, and inability to cooperate with him. It even proves that we are existences that are inferior to him and more in need of appeasement.</p>
<p>"The silent witness is the most powerful." I remembered this sentence.</p>
<h3 id="e249">Night Watch <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— By Huo Bao</p>
<p>It's my turn to stand watch on the night shift line,</p>
<p>I stand in the middle of the graveyard, looking around;</p>
<p>There are countless sentinels,</p>
<p>Who have died for us;</p>
<p>Countless lives have died in the ancient无间(Avici hell),</p>

<h3 id="e250">The Strong Character of the Nation <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— By Qu Yi</p>
<p>Gorky, in his essay "On Drama," said this:</p>
<p>"The basic mission of art must transcend reality, and look at today's cause from the height of the glorious goal built by the creators of the new mankind—the working class... Heroic deeds must have heroic language."</p>
<p>In another place, he said:</p>
<p>"The modern heroes—scholars, inventors, builders, Komsomol Ploneers, poets—have not yet been noticed, and even if they are noticed, they are still decorated with soulless language."</p>
<p>Gorky often called on young Soviet writers to write a typical new hero who creates a second nature.</p>
<p>In the current stage of China, what kind of typical new hero do we require of literature? Our heroes must possess a huge national soul and be able to make strong and unyielding resistance to all oppressors.—Our heroes must be the strong character of the nation.</p>
<p>Recently, after reading several novels by Shu Qun, I saw the expression of such a strong character. The first article published in "Literature" *The Child Without a Homeland*, Guoli and Guolisha have the same aspect of a strong character, one showing the perseverance of not having a homeland, and the other showing contempt for people who live like mice. However, Guoli finally put a knife into the devil's chest. He was checked on the road, but he was willing to admit that he was Korean and be bound, dedicating the magnificent soul of the nation. Next, he published "Sparks in the Desert" in the literary world. Like the previous article, he also wrote a tough and persevering Sadartu and a rough and tough A Huta. Under their various misunderstandings and tolerances, sparks finally broke out when they went on an expedition against the Mongolian bandits. And in "Mongolian Night" (see "Guangming" Issue 1), he wrote about the strength of a young man resisting the war and the calm and adaptability of a woman. Until her death, the woman also snatched the enemy's bayonet, showing an unyielding spirit of resistance. From Guoli to Sadartu and even this Mongolian woman, the author has given them all a persevering, calm, but extremely brave soul. Although A Huta was a little irritable, in his honesty and bravery, he also possessed the precious and strong character of the Chinese masses.</p>
<p>Then the author expanded this strong character to another side. In "Xiao Ling" in the second issue of "Literature," the author wrote about a lively female student's resistance to feudal forces with a very lively tone. The ensuing "Incident" made her an active anti-imperialist element. However, Zhang Xun, a mild-mannered instructor with feudal ideas, fulfilled his dog's role in the incident. In this combination, the contrast between the characters of the two nations is very meaningful. In "Dead and Undead" in the July issue of "Literature," the author also wrote about Li Jin, who has the same strong character as Xiao Ling, and Li Jin's woman, who has the same stubbornness as the Mongolian woman.—This woman, when her husband was tied out to be "executed with," stabbed herself in the chest and died. Although she could not get rid of the shackles of old ideas; continuing her husband's cause with her life; but with her magnificent behavior, compared with those traitors who sell the life of the nation like prostitutes, she is still worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>In short, all the characters written by Shu Qun are very strong in character, and this very strong character is revealed under the entire crisis of the nation. However, they are all unified and revealed under the spirit of anti-imperialism. We don't know if this is what the author intended to write. However, this is the author's personal participation in the anti-Japanese war in the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, which we can imagine. We believe that at this time in China, the creation of a strong national character in literature will be more important than anything else. National defense literature will have its brilliant foundation on this point.</p>

<h3 id="e251">Talking About Pedicures <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— By Me</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Haircuts and baths are slightly interesting." In fact, haircuts and baths are not very interesting. What is interesting is pedicures, because of physiological needs and the progress of the times. After pedicures, there are foot scrapings, and after foot scrapings, there are foot massages. New patterns emerge and skills abound. If we invite textual researchers to examine the history of pedicures meticulously and one by one, wouldn't it be possible to create a great work?</p>
<p>According to a recent report in a certain newspaper, Mr. Xu Shiying, our ambassador to Japan, had a habit of getting pedicures when he was in the country. After going to Japan, his feet and toes suddenly became very itchy, which he couldn't solve, causing him to be restless day and night. Coincidentally, he met a certain gentleman from Shanghai who was familiar with the situation in Japan, so he asked him to find a pedicurist. The gentleman found a Japanese barber, but his skills were not very good, causing Ambassador Xu's toes to bleed and be broken, and he was extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>Pedicures are originally a small art, and it is not an easy task. Even in our country, which is famous for its good pedicures, it is not easy to find truly skilled pedicurists, and barbers are specialized in doing upper-class work, while pedicurists are specialized in doing lower-class work. Their habits have their own specializations, and their positions are not equal. Now, Ambassador Xu wants to张冠李戴 (put a hat on someone else's head), using a barber to do pedicuring work. It's really like "asking a cooper to build a house." It is appropriate that he should sacrifice his blood and make a big sale.</p>
<p>Moreover, from the great principle of human equality, it seems too far against humanitarianism for one person to be sleeping leisurely on a tatami and another person to be sitting next to him giving a pedicure. In fact, there are many examples of violating humanitarianism in the world, not just pedicures. Therefore, the current government has issued a clear order prohibiting this kind of inhumane behavior in bathrooms, which is originally correct. According to this statement, Ambassador Xu is inevitably suspected of violating the order, but from the principle of making money, this is indeed a way to make money. Assuming that you want customers' legal tender to willingly take it out of their pockets, in addition to剥猪罗玀 (skinning pigs), there is no way to achieve the goal without using this method. Therefore, assuming that you want to eliminate this lower-level work, to be honest, it is cutting off their livelihood.</p>
<p>Therefore, I realize that there are only two ways to make money, hard work and soft deception. Haircuts use knives, and pedicures also use knives, and these knives are better the sharper they are, clearly indicating a threatening method. On the one hand, they use their hands to massage you, massaging you until your bones are tired and you can't resist. This is a soft deception method. Threat and soft deception are used together, and the customer's money will naturally be willingly and quickly taken out of their wallet.</p>
<p>Now Japan's approach to China also mostly uses pedicuring methods. What they call "diplomatic unification" is to use both hard and soft methods. First the three northeastern provinces, then the four northeastern provinces, and then the eastern Hebei and northern Chahar. Now they are taking it a step further to completely control North China. This kind of pedicuring political wrist is coming in step by step, making people feel at ease and frustrated. How can this be done?</p>
<h3 id="e252">Rain <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Harris</p>
<p>The rain is drizzling again.</p>
<p>If I had known that this summer would be so rainy, I should have saved a few dollars to buy a new raincoat. That day, Chu Zi came from the south, and I made a special trip to Taikoo Wharf to meet him, only to encounter rain halfway. Raindrops the size of beans hit the glass of the tram window, then flowed down, winding and blurring everything on the street. There were only a few people sparsely in the carriage. It was dusk, and after the ticket seller turned on the electric lights in the carriage, he stood blankly to the side, humming a Peking opera tune. When we arrived at the Bund, the rain was even heavier, pattering on the asphalt road. I had no rain gear at all. I hesitated on the platform, and since the tram was about to leave, I had to jump off and run towards the wharf.</p>
<p>I waited at the wharf for about twenty minutes, taking in the rainy scenery of the Huangpu River. There was no feeling of affection, only an unusual sense of depression and annoyance. I was wondering: what will Chu Zi bring me? He came from my hometown, and I have been wandering abroad for eight whole years.</p>
<p>Chu Zi's face showed a smile warmed by friendship; but covered in travel dust, having crossed the southern sea, he ultimately showed signs of fatigue and was eager to find lodging. Seeing that I was almost completely drenched by the rain, Chu Zi must have felt my enthusiasm in welcoming him in the rain, holding my hand and thanking me repeatedly. I quickly said to him:</p>
<p>"Why are you suddenly being so polite? Is it because we've been separated for three years? ...When I came out just now, the sky was only overcast, and it only started raining halfway."</p>
<p>So, on the carriage to the hostel, amidst the pattering rain, Chu Zi brought news of the abundant rain in our hometown. "It's really been raining a lot in our hometown this year," he began, "In the spring," there were seven consecutive days of rain. The rice seedlings planted in the fields were all ruined by the flood, and the field ridges were submerged, with no clear boundary. The water in the ponds overflowed, and Third Uncle, who raises fish, was so flustered that he didn't even have time to eat. Flooding! Ah, can you imagine our hometown after the flood!"</p>
<p>Our hometown is desolate and broken! That's what Chu Zi brought. At night, I came back and lay alone in bed, turned off the lights, and the sound of raindrops outside was even clearer. A whole series of memories surfaced, back when Chu Zi and I were both still children. In spring, peach blossoms bloomed fragrantly in the fields, dotting the green lawns. Orioles sang, their chirping voices waking me up from my dreams early in the morning. The fields were green, the sky was bright, swallows murmured under the eaves, and the front of the house was bathed in warm sunlight. Every day, I lived in the southern countryside with a carefree heart. Not understanding the ways of the world, I hid under the eaves to watch the lotus leaves in the pond, spread out like fans, holding crystal-like water droplets. In summer, lotus flowers bloomed, attracting buzzing bees, and also enlivening the hearts of us children. That time was so warm and beautiful, so unforgettable...</p>
<p>The longing for my hometown tormented me; the pattering night rain tormented me.</p>
<p>Wandering in the metropolis, walking alone on the journey of life, I lack so much the warmth of sunshine, and I am always stumbling in the mud of rainy days. Chu Zi understands me and sympathizes with me. He has comforted me and encouraged me with a grateful warmth.</p>
<p>And it's raining again, such a sad, gray rainy day!</p>
<h3 id="e253">Rickshaw Puller <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Xiangdong</p>
<p>When our family's rickshaw puller left, he introduced Ya Xiang and said, "I'm afraid I can't pull the rickshaw anymore because I'm getting old, so I resigned to your master. Now, I'm calling Ah Xiang to pull the master's rickshaw; look at this guy; he's young and strong, the master will definitely like him!"</p>
<p>The one being called "master" was my father. At this time, Ah Xiang was dressed in very tattered clothes, and his appearance was very unsightly. If you looked at him closely, you could see that his face still had not-so-obvious pockmarks. His body was very strong, his height was quite tall, and his strength was no problem. My father asked him a few simple questions, such as whether he was familiar with the streets of Shanghai, and then accepted him, and immediately gave him two dollars, telling him to make two sets of clothes. This made him grateful and thanking him repeatedly, and he left.</p>
<p>The next day, he began to pull my father to his office, and then pulled him back for lunch. We treated him very well, letting him live in the attic room. My father was not good at socializing; except for the four trips in and out a day, he rarely went anywhere else. I didn't take the rickshaw, but I sometimes had the opportunity to get close to Ah Xiang. That was when we were both staying at home at night, people were putting their minds into mahjong or chatting, but I liked to stand by the door, quietly thinking about things, looking at the stars in the sky. Ah Xiang often tidied up the rickshaw there, sometimes even washing the dirty wheels with water. When he found me standing next to him, he politely called me "young master" and asked me why I hadn't gone back to my room to rest. At first, I only talked to him about how hot the weather was, or how the rickshaw puller's life was; although it was also very hard work, compared to the rickshaw pullers who were like cattle and horses, he couldn't help but say, "I am much happier."</p>
<p>As we became more and more familiar, we talked more. I knew Ah Xiang. Originally had a very decent family and a wife. They diligently cultivated the land for the landlord, and they could still make a living for the family. However, in recent years, natural and man-made disasters have come together, and the landlord's rent cannot be escaped, so they had to borrow money. So, in addition to the various exploitations that farmers cannot escape, Ah Xiang also owed debts, eroded by interest, and became more and more embarrassed day by day, almost unable to live. Later, he put the burden of the family on his brother's shoulders and wandered alone to the city. Most of his current monthly income has to be sent home.</p>
<p>"Young master, you people who are used to enjoying blessings, how can you imagine the suffering of our villagers?" He shook his head and sighed, ending his speech.</p>
<p>Every time a letter came from home, he would hold it to show me, asking me to explain the meaning of the letter to him. Because of my question, "Do you want to write a reply?" he indicated that he wouldn't dare to trouble me to do such a thing. However, I took him to my father's study, opened the letter paper, and told him to say what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>"Young master, tell her: I am very safe here. I send money home every time I get it. ...Ask her if the child has grown up a bit? Take good care of them. Also, the debt at Uncle Li Ba's place, I will definitely be responsible for paying it off, tell my brother to rest assured. ...That's it, there's nothing else to say."</p>
<p>"Really nothing else to say?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Our villagers' words count as one word!"</p>
<p>Ah Xiang's honesty and kindness were obviously liked by my father as well. However, there was always some kind of barrier between us. Every time I heard his trembling voice calling me "young master," I felt uneasy. Moreover, Ah Xiang slowly realized after mixing in the city for a long time how different this cattle-and-horse life was from our comfort. Once I heard him say such words to others: "We are also people, why can others sit in a rickshaw, but I must pull the rickshaw?" Turning around to see me walking past, he stopped immediately. I didn't blame him, I simply had nothing else to say: I walked into the door, and Ah Xiang must have watched me go, right.</p>
<p>Two years passed like this, and Ah Xiang also resigned from my home. He wasn't doing it because he was old, but because he was going to work in a factory. He didn't introduce a new rickshaw puller to us, and my father didn't take the rickshaw anymore.</p>
<h3 id="e254">The Farmer Who Grows Watermelons <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Growing watermelons is also a sideline in the countryside, and in some places, the farmers are unwilling to grow rice and only grow watermelons, because if the year is good and the watermelons sell for a good price, the profit is far greater than growing rice and wheat; for this reason, many farmers rely on growing watermelons to make a living.</p>
<p>However, the fertilizer used to grow watermelons is more than that used for rice and wheat, and if the harvest is bad and the watermelons don't sell for a good price, the loss is more severe than growing other things; therefore, prudent farmers will never grow too many watermelons, and even if they do, it will only be a few acres, as an accessory.</p>
<p>Watermelons are sown after Qingming. The ridges must be picked high, and ditches must be made on both sides, so that rainwater can be discharged very smoothly. It is said that dry soil is good for growing watermelons, and some people even say that a piece of land that has grown watermelons this year cannot be grown again next year, at least not for</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>ten years. If the same field is grown this year and then again next year, the watermelon will be bland and tasteless. However, ordinary farmers, if he grows ten acres of watermelons, and if he wants to grow ten acres every year, and the field that has been grown is separated by ten years before growing watermelons again, then he must have one hundred acres of land to be able to rotate, but in fact, where would he have one hundred acres of land? Therefore, it will never be separated by ten years before planting again. At most, it is separated by three to five years. However, it is very good to grow watermelons in this field this year and rice next year, so experienced farmers alternate between watermelons and rice.</p>
<p>After planting watermelons, the most important part of the work is to press the vines, because when the watermelon vines grow long, they must be pressed down with mud in a straight line, otherwise the vines of this one and that one will cross and the watermelons will be bad or mutated. During the plum rain season, the weather can determine the fate of watermelon growers, because every day of rain or flooding will cause the watermelon vines to rot and the watermelon fruit to be not sweet. The method of growing watermelons also varies. Shandong people are famous for growing watermelons. They only leave one watermelon on each plant and pick the rest off. As for the farmers near Shanghai, they leave two or three on each plant, the so-called first vine watermelon, second vine watermelon, and last vine watermelon, so the watermelons grown by Shandong people are huge, with the heaviest weighing thirty or forty catties!</p>
<p>After the farmer grows the watermelons and brings them to the market for sale, in our countryside, he cannot sell them directly to the consumers, but must go through the hands of the local goods store. However, the local goods store takes a profit of one-tenth in the process, so the farmer only gets nine dollars for every ten dollars of watermelons sold, and the local goods store owner makes a profit without labor, only making the watermelon-growing farmers suffer more exploitation.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, aren't there local goods stores in Shiliupu, Xinzha Bridge, and Laozha Bridge? Therefore, people who grow watermelons also have to go to the local goods store when they transport watermelons to Shanghai, and then the local goods store sells them to wholesalers, retailers, or consumers. Of course, the local goods store can also get a profit of one-tenth in the middle, and the watermelon dealers have to make money through several turnovers. The farmer's multiple layers of exploitation are quite pitiful to say. In addition, in recent years, ice cream and soda have flooded the market in Shanghai, and the selling price of watermelons will not be high, only making the watermelon-growing farmers work hard for three months, and the result is that it is difficult to make a profit.</p>
<h3 id="e255">The Incense Thief <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>—One of the Mountain Travel Notes</p>
<p>In the summer of 1935, a few young companions and I mustered up our courage and traveled to the remote mountains and wilderness of northern Jiangxi. After crossing the Lion Ridge of Dalong Mountain, my companions and I all felt very tired, because everyone was carrying nearly 20 catties of dry food bags, and had already walked more than 20 li for half a day. A double-barreled shotgun weighing more than ten catties was also constantly moved to everyone's shoulders in turn. It was our weapon to defend against wild beasts and local bandits in this sparsely populated mountain.</p>
<p>There are no large trees with dense shade on Lion Ridge. The red sun spits out fierce flames, covering the entire mountain ridge. There is no path, and sharp stones and wild grass grow in disorder, making people afraid to move forward, as if venomous fire-tongue snakes are winding all over the place. Two of our friends frowned and began to complain; "If we had known that there were no trees on the mountain ridge to hide from the shade, we shouldn't have rested in the valley for a while longer, and we shouldn't have walked so fast!"</p>
<p>We had no choice but to straighten our backs and move forward, shifting the dry food bag on our shoulders. Lifting our heads, the mountain peak towering into the clouds opposite was placed before our eyes again. It was filled with white mist and emitting hot green smoke, and yellow sand seemed to be flying in the air. Everyone couldn't help but shudder, and a burst of hot sweat poured out of their pores.</p>
<p>In this Dalong Mountain, which winds for hundreds of miles, there are no houses. We had to rush to Xingzi County before the sun set to find a place to stay. Lion Ridge is about 30 li away from Xingzi County, although the sun tells us it is still early.</p>
<p>After descending Lion Ridge, it is a dark and deep valley, and a cool breath drilled into our hearts and lungs, and everyone couldn't help but have their souls flying. We sat down by the stream, the spring water flowed slowly, making a "嚓嚓" sound. The stream was uneven, and the spring water rushed up violently, and then suddenly flowed down, the sound of knocking on the bluestone slab seemed to be playing pleasant music for us.</p>
<p>Everyone took out the bread from their dry food bags to fill their stomachs, and poured the spring water into their mouths with their hands. The water was as clear and cool as ice. We ate and drank, simply forgetting to hurry on our way.</p>
<p>At some point, two people came down from the mountain peak on our way. It was not until these two people approached us that they were discovered by our young companion, Xiao Wang. They were all wearing a set of black cloth short jackets and trousers, and they were carrying a heavy bamboo basket in their hands. One of them asked us in a rough voice; "Hey, folks, (note) is this the way to Nanchang Prefecture?" He pointed to a small road on the side of the valley in front.</p>
<p>After we told him, they strode away. Our young companion Xiao Wang said in surprise; "Alas, I was scared to death! These two guys must not be good people, look, how terrible those fierce, pointed eyes are!"</p>
<p>However, none of us felt that way, and without caring, everyone stood up, put the food bag back on their shoulders, and we were also preparing to hurry on our way. At this time, the sun had already slanted a little to the west.</p>
<p>Along the way, our young companion Xiao Wang kept chattering that those two guys were not good people.</p>
<p>Just stepping on the high peak, more than a dozen people suddenly ran in front of us, some holding shoulder poles in their hands, and some holding spears. As soon as they ran to our front, they asked in panic; "Gentlemen, did you see two people carrying bamboo baskets in their hands?"</p>

<p>Green trees are lush and shady in the long summer days. The gentle breeze stirs the scent of water chestnuts and lotus. The summer is hot like fire. Sweat beads wet the thin silk dress. Gently shake the silk fan and sit in the pavilion. The clear shadow of green bamboo shines in the quiet window. (But see that) overlapping green lotus leaves are infinitely blue. Reflecting the sun, the lotus flowers send fragrance in the wind. Lotus flowers pass through the water, and dragonflies dot them. Butterflies fly diagonally over the short wall. Mandarin ducks float on the water with their necks intertwined. Pairs of white rabbits hide in the grass. Yellow orioles sing on the green locust branches. The sound of cicadas never stops, clamoring in the evening sun. Fallen flowers drift with the water. No one crosses the wild ferry, and the boat is horizontal by itself. Thin twilight clouds cover the red sun. The jade rabbit rises in the east and shines on the flower wall. And see that fireflies dance and flicker. Frogs croak and fill the pond. Sitting for a long time, suddenly startled by the movement of cool shadows. A burst of evening breeze blows all over the body. Suddenly I heard the cuckoo crying in the night moon. Causing sad people to want to break their intestines. Alone and lonely, the most desolate.</p>

<p>Opening "Complaining Husband" (Mimi Collection No.)</p>
<p>The moon is bright and the stars are scattered, and the sky is not yet bright. The beautiful woman waits for her husband in the room. Facing the silver lamp, she locks her brows tightly. Low head silently moaning. Thinking back to the past when she was spoiled and raised in the inner room. In her spare time, she recites poetry. Sometimes sisters come. Compose songs and sing songs together and play the piano. Since marrying into her husband's house. Counting the time has been three springs. The elders in the hall have passed away. Hard work and effort to manage the family affairs. It is hateful that the good man is always dimly gambling. Wasting money, losing his job, and wasting his youth. Sometimes gambling until late at night. Sometimes not returning home for days. I often persuade him bitterly. Who knows that good words are offensive and anger arises. He never thinks about the economic difficulties of the past year. Nor does he think about the sad voices of his delicate wife upstairs. I often wait all night without sleeping. Like sitting on pins and needles, complaining. I only end up with a brocade quilt spread out and no one sleeping. The mandarin duck pillow is cold and desolate. The moonlight shines on the gauze window, and the shadow accompanies the shape. To whom can I say my heartfelt words? Sitting alone and feeling lonely. A heart full of thoughts is sullen. Youthful couples are like painted cakes. Wrongly signed on the Three Lives Stone. Sighing that red face is too thin. It is better to shave her hair and enter the empty door. That beautiful woman is now as sad as the sea. The brocade chicken sings three times, and the sky is bright. Suddenly, the maid came to report. The madam is sending gifts in the front hall. Raise your body and walk lightly. Slightly glancing and seeing clearly. It turns out that my mother sent me a wireless. Radio to relieve my troubles. Wait for me to return to visit my mother.</p>

<p>Pan Wenxia and her sister Wenjuan, who were once rumored to be engaged to Yan Hua, reorganized the Rose Dance Troupe and went to India and Southeast Asia to perform after finishing "Song of the Rose." After nearly a year, they have started their return journey north from Annam. They will stay in Hong Kong for about one or two days and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 9th of this month. This is specially announced for those who love Miss Pan.</p>
<p>The Da Zhonghua Dance Troupe, reorganized from the Bright Moon Society led by Li Jinguang, took a French mail ship to Annam for performance at 10:00 AM on June 28. It is said that there is a great risk of running aground.</p>

<h3 id="e260">"Guangling Tide" Rushes to Produce Costumes <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>This is an unprecedented record in the film industry. The Yi Hua Film Company, due to the filming of "Guangling Tide," has specially set up a garment workshop within the company, inviting more than 30 tailors from outside to work day and night to rush-produce the costumes for "Guangling Tide."</p>
<p>We know that "Guangling Tide" is a depiction of the corruption of officials in the late Qing Dynasty, as well as the fearless struggle of revolutionary pioneers who spare no effort and regard death as home in order to fight for national liberation. The story is tragic and passionate, and the plot is shocking and moving.</p>
<p>Because its background is in the Qing Dynasty, the costumes and other items must be suitable for the era. Therefore, Yi Hua's costume room is like an ancient costume exhibition, with all kinds of costumes, which seem quite novel from today's perspective. Various costumes are being completed one after another by the hands of more than 30 tailors, and then hung in the wardrobe. This kind of practice of asking tailors to the company to make costumes is indeed an unprecedented initiative. The money spent on costumes for "Guangling Tide" is at least three thousand gold pieces.</p>

<p>— Lai</p>
<p>An artist with a solitary personality</p>
<p>Among the many busy people in Hollywood, he is one of them. In addition to running back and forth between Hollywood, New York, and London, busy filming and acting, he also writes screenplays. "Murry Hill" was a sensational screenplay written and performed by him. In addition, he also frequently contributes to many publications, magazines, and monthly publications such as Vanity Fair and New York, mostly discussing theories or dramas. He hopes to become a film director, and he collects all materials related to film.</p>
<p>Thus, his free time is very little. Sometimes he is seen playing with his two children, whom he loves more than his wife. He loves taking pictures. Whenever he is free, he always has a camera in his hand.</p>
<p>He plays tennis very well, and he is also a strong swimmer. However, he likes polo the most. He raises four or five trained horses himself, and his heroic figure is often seen on the wilderness field. He also likes raising dogs, and has many, but they don't have any real use.</p>
<p>Living a very simple life, he and his wife and two children live in a just barely adequate house. He doesn't care about clothes at all. He usually loves to wear an old-fashioned pair of flannel pants, a short plaid top, and a floral scarf, looking very unlike a "sharp-headed guy." He loves to dance, but he dances badly. He also likes to sing, but he always sings in the bathroom, never opening his mouth in front of people. He loves to eat beef steak, the fattier the better, but he is as thin as a monkey, with a long face. He likes to take walks, and is often seen wandering alone in the woods for the whole afternoon. He has light reddish-brown hair, is five feet ten inches tall, and weighs one hundred and forty-five pounds.</p>
<p>"The Martyrdom of a Famous Scholar" is a play he co-starred with Bette Davis, the影后 of 1935. He also performed this play on stage. His new film is Shakespeare's masterpiece "Romeo and Juliet," starring Norma Shearer, produced by MGM. It is currently being actively filmed and will soon be completed. (Guang)</p>
<h3 id="e262">Random Notes <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Five Star Film Company hosted the press and "screenwriters" at the Dengtuomo Hotel. Zhou Jianyun gave a long speech at the banquet, which has been recorded in the newspaper, so it is omitted here. However, the final "entertainment" can still be recorded for everyone's amusement. He talked about Gao Zhanfei leaving Star, and some people think it is Star's "violent storm." What is this saying? Regarding the love dispute between Pan Zinong and Shu Xiuwen, Zhou always stood in the position of reconciliation. The newspaper reported something about Yao Xinnong, and Zhou Jianyun said that I am not their parent. What is this saying? Although the "entertainment" made some people "unhappy again," the laughter was very high at the time.</p>
<p>Regarding the filming of "The Bewildered Lamb," Ge Zuo Zhi, who had been growing his hair for nearly a year, has completely shaved his head, like a little monk.</p>
<p>The Star Film Company's music department has hired four professors to train singing and music theory. Training has already begun in recent days. In addition to four hours of basic music theory together each week, there is also individual training for actors. Star employees also have a choir.</p>
<p>The young Ye Fenjun has recently formed a "Drama Movement Society" and will soon perform the play "Who is a Traitor." He has also formed a singing group to broadcast patriotic songs, and has been contacting various radio stations in recent days.</p>
<p>In Jin Yan's "Waves Washing Sand," he played A Long, drifting to a deserted island, and eventually his white bones were abandoned on the ground. Now in "Go to Nature," he plays Ma Long, also doing the same thing, drifting to a deserted island. But in this film, he survives from a dead end and becomes a hero of the times.</p>
