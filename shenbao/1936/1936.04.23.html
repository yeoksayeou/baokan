<p>— Dr．RalphW．Chaney原著　陳紹燕譯</p>
<p>因為在北京城附近發現的緣故？他被稱為「北京人」。科學的名稱是：Sinaothropus　Pekingensis。「北京人」的技巧，也可以從尋得的粗製石英片段來證明。因為這些石英片段就是用以切割和刻刮的工具。「北京人」已能用火，可以在幾尺厚的灰燼裹看出來，這些灰燼深深地靠洞壁堆積着，當時「北京女人」也許懶得搬出洞外，便馬馬虎虎掃在那兒罷。</p>
<p>這些堆積着的灰燼層裏已經有幾種很有意味的發現了。從並未完全燒過的柴塊，可以認明和現在中國北部或別處乾寒地帶所產生的植物是相同的。還有大量燒焦的骨殖斷塊，也可以指示此處曾經烹煮過馬肉，野牛，犀牛，和其他生產於西山或附近平原的過去獸類。這些獸類，現在中國北部已不生存了。</p>
<p>這許多獸類，都被「北京人」選作食料，可以證明當時這裹是一片平原廣野，或者還有生存溪傍的樹林，好像現在半乾燥地帶一樣。「北京人」住在洞裹必須生火取煖，或燒煮他所食的東西，這事實就可解釋當時是低溫度的氣候。在同一地質學的時代，北美洲大部分和歐洲全是一片冰河，因此這個時代，在地球歷史上，通稱為冰河時代。那時亞洲東北部是沒有泳河的，因為天氣比較乾燥的緣故。</p>
<p>離這古代人類最原始的住所二十英尺以上，在角礫石裏面，發見許多各種手工製造的石英工具和骨骼斷片，還有幾英寸厚的一層，全是許多果核的硬壳的碎片所結成的。從壳面上紋理看來，可斷定是朴（Celtis）核的壳，是一種小球形，小得比豌豆還小的實體。，那麽這些種子如何會搬進到這山洞裹來，並且會搗成碎塊呢，這倒是一個重大而緊要的問題。</p>
<p>現代的朴樹為森林中一種小樹，生於北美洲和亞洲，它最大的特性，為生在半乾燥山麓和溪流近旁，風和流水，這兩種最普通的轉運的媒介，想來都不會把這些果核帶進洞裹去的。同樣，要臆斷這些朴樹生在山洞裹面也不可能，因為直接的太陽光綫，為各種高等植物生長的必需條伴。</p>
<p>似乎無疑的，這大量的朴核，是從洞外帶進去的，而且被吃着的時候，那硬壳是壓碎了的。現在引起的問題是：誰將這些硬核帶進周家店的山洞裹去？究竟是最早的人類呢？還是別種獸類呢？</p>
<p>朴實的外形，很像小的櫻桃，外皮和果肉包住一粒堅核，核內就是他的種子。在美國極乾燥的地方，這些果實是被烏類，　齒類，和印第安人當作食物的。有好幾種樹和灌木，凡是生有大而甘美的果實的，常被西南部的印第安人按時採取。</p>
<p>通常這果實的吃法，和吃櫻桃一樣，皮和果肉都吞下去，至於那整個的核當然是要都棄去，或是嚼成碎塊，大一點的就從嘴裹吐出來。</p>
<p>這果實最普通的用途，就是使肉類和麵包增加香味，將果實軋碎，液汁榨去以後，與別種食物同煮，最後將剩餘的硬核碎塊棄去。假使「北京人」食用朴實的方法和上述一樣，那麽，我們希望在他的窟洞內所堆積的碎核裏面，能够尋究出眞實的情形來。</p>
<p>周家店山洞裹也尋到齧齒類的化石骨骼，因此疑心那把朴實帶到山洞裹面，將核留下而存積起來的，是這些齧齒類而不是「北京人」，這或許是可能的。有了這樣的可能性存在心裏，費了不少心力，來研究現時生存的相同的齧齒類，用何種方法　開朴實硬核，從裏面取得那可食的種子。</p>

<p>中央社云、昨日為禁烟拒毒宜傳週播音宣傳日、下午四時至四時半、本市公安局長蔡勁軍特派第四科稽核股主任夏仲明代表前往中西電臺播音、對於禁烟意義、有極詳盡之解釋、茲將</p>
<p>播音原詞　錄下、本市的民眾們、本月二十日起、至二十六日止、是禁烟拒毒擴大宣傳週、為什麽要規定這個禁烟拒毒擴大宣傳週呢、就是要把烟毒的禍害、擴大宣傳、使全市的居民、明瞭烟毒對於國家民族生存的威脅、引起市民的注意、與烟民的覺悟、共同努力、肅淸烟毒、以鞏固國家民族的生存、</p>
<p>其意義是　很重要的、中國受烟毒的禍害、已經有幾百年的歷史、近百年來受害更深、幾乎斷送整個國家和民族的生存、凡有識之士、奠不痛心疾首、說起中國禁烟的歷史、可說也有三百　了、自前淸乾隆年間開始、而至民國成立、北洋軍閥掌政時期、都有禁烟命令的頒布、其中以道光時林則徐在廣東禁烟所取的方法為最厲、因之引起了鴉片戰爭、訂立不平等條的、其影饗於我國家地位為最大、所以考我國過去禁烟之結果、都是失敗、失敗的原因何在呢、因過去主張禁烟的人士、只知道鴉片應當禁绝、而不知講求禁绝的方法、因為禁炯的方法不妥善、所以沒有成效、結果是失敗了、蔣委員長因鑒於鴉片之禍、較前更烈、若不從速禁绝、將陷國家民族於萬刦不復之地位、所以規定了</p>
<p>六年禁烟　計劃、並詳定禁绝的方案、採取妥善的方法、使易於推行而收限期完成之效、現在禁烟的方法、是種運吸售四方面兼籌並顧、因為只禁吸不禁種運售三者、那末、種者自種、運者自運、售者自售、而禁吸成效也被其打消了、反之亦然、所以種運售吸四者、同時並進、而以禁吸為中心、禁烟的第一步就是先登記烟民、使所有吸鴉片的人、都登記了、那末、我們可以知道各省市吸烟的烟民有多少、吸量是多少、得到一個統計、知道烟民的總數、作為分年施戒的標準、知道吸量的總數、才可以作為統制種運售的辦法、所以有了烟民分年施戒的標準、也就有了種運售三者分年遞减的辦法、等到烟民完全戒绝、那末、種運售三者也就可完全禁绝了、所以禁烟必須種運售吸</p>
<p>四者並進　才能得到效果、上面已經說過、梵吸為禁烟的中心、而禁吸的第一步為烟民登記、登記辦法、現在全國業經積極推行、本市已於去年七月起、開始登記、至十二月底截止、登記的烟民、是三萬〇八百三十三人、但據調查與特業公會的估計、未登記的烟民、為數　多、茲以未登記的烟民因為登記截止、無法領照時、有被拘判罪的憂慮、雖由於烟民不明瞭登記的意義的緣故、且亦影響梵政的前途、肉為烟民不依法盡數登記、則烟民總數與吸量總數、無法統計精確、那末、對於種運售三者的統制、也無法進行了、蔣委員長兼禁烟總監、因為各省市登記烟民未臻普通、所以最近令飭各省市實施烟民總檢舉、特派專員、會同各省市辦理、又頒佈了一種檢舉烟民、</p>
<p>登記辦法　檢舉烟民登記辦法的內容、一面派員警挨戶檢舉烟民之檢查、有未登記烟民、則勒令登記、一面准許未登記之烟民補行登記、暫不辦罪、這種辦法、可說政府為體卹烟民寬大處置、而予燜民自新之機、在烟民方面的利害上設想、能得此機會、補行登記免蹈法網、實是一種最難得的機會、倘使失掉了這决補行登記的機會、以後想再求一個登記的機會、恐怕比登天還難了、所以希望未登記的烟民、在檢舉烟民准許補行登記期內、趕快向公安局及分局所隊去聲請登記、如再因循觀望、不遵章登記、等到三個月期限完了以後、無照吸烟、一被查獲、就解司令部照禁烟治罪暫行條例法辦、無所寬容了、烟民們注意、這是</p>
<p>最後一次　的登記機會、趕快去補行登記、勿再自誤、以致後悔莫及、登記的烟民及吸量、照章是應常分期施戒的、分期遞减的、規定以六個月為一期、就是登記烟民中、有一部份應當在第一期六個月中戒绝、而一般未能在第一期六個月中戒絕的、亦應當將吸量酌减、故未能戒绝的燜民、應換領戒烟執照、暫時吸食、將烟量再行遞减、以至於戒绝、所以在厲行戒烟取締吸章程中、有限期戒烟執照、每一個月換領一决的規定、本市自二十四年七月開始登記、至十二月底截止、所有發出的戒烟執照六個月的有效期間、巳經屆滿、照章須調換新照、所以自四月一日起至五月三十一日止、為本市烟民換領第二期執照之期、如其過</p>
<p>五月卅一　日、還沒有來登記換照領新照、那末、以前所領的舊執照、就一律作廢、以後吸食鴉片、就作無照私吸論、几無照私吸的熾民、如被本局查緝員警查到、就加以拘捕、依法解送司令部訊辦、其科刑處罪、依照禁烟治罪暫行條例第八條之規定、處六月以上二年以下的有期徒刑、得併科三百元以下的罰金、希望領有第一期執照的烟民們、遵照規定的限期、速即自動到局、聲請換照登記、至於換照的手續、早經在報章中公布了、</p>
<p>辦理烟民登記和發給限期戒烟執照的主旨、為得燜民總數、以為分年施戒的標準、其目的還是</p>
<p>分年戒烟　以達禁絕的目的、不過年老癮深、一時不能戒绝的烟民、發給執照暫時吸食、使其吸量逐漸減少、以至戒绝、故戒绝的方法、比較和綏、時間較長、這是政府體諒年老癮不能即時戒绝者一種苦心、並非一領執照、就可以永久吸烟、不用戒绝、倘烟民存了這種意思、那就完全誤會了政府的苦心與用意所以烟民們能够明瞭政府的禁烟决心、自投公安局請求送戒的、不但為我們所嘉許、而且還極端歡迎的、本市設有市立戒烟醫院三處、臨　戒毒所一處、設備都很完備、技術亦甚純熟、而</p>
<p>一切費用　均由市政府負擔、烟民無須納費的、所以烟民們願意立即戒绝的、可自請投戒、這為烟民戒烟最好的機會、倘使烟民自願納費戒烟的、衛生局和公安局、會指定設備完善技術優良的醫院十七處、亦可人院戒烟、得到戒绝證明書後、呈繳公安局備案後、即可認為戒绝烟癮、所以烟民能够認識政府的禁烟政策、和决心、能够立即戒烟的、實為政府所嘉許、</p>
<p>我在設明了政府的禁烟政業禁烟方法以後、希望吸食鴉片的烟民們、有澈底的了解、市民有澈底的、</p>
<p>了解認識　我們要使中華民族永久生存於世界、中華民國永立於國際間、我們對於危害我們永久生存的烟毒、要作猛烈的功擊、澈底的消滅、並希望烟民們遵照政府所定的法令奉行、以謀早日戒绝、完全人格、仍為國家一個良好的國民、這是我熱烈期望的、市民們、我們一致起來、努力禁烟拒毒運動、市民們遵照政府的法令奉行、消滅一生痛苦、挽回後來的幸福、</p>

<p>（上海工商業槪况之二十三）</p>
<p>法商：法商保險公司在滬者其少，多歸保太保險公司Assurance　France-Asiatizne</p>
<p>管理，至法美保險公司，Comragnie　France　Americaine　Dassmances雖係向法領事署註冊，但實際上美國人投資較多，　非純粹法國公司，茲將兩公司內容分述於下</p>
<p>一，保太保險公司　該公司創立於一九一八年，係有限公司，資本總額七百萬法郎，實收資本亦如上數，至一九三四年度止公積金達二二·六二三·八七二法郎，資產總額達三六·〇九五·九三〇法郎，專保水火汽車，意外等險，總公司設於巴黎，上海分公司　於天主堂街一號，董事長為Fano　R.君，總經理為Breen　J.君，每年營業收入達二千餘萬法郎，一九三一年盈餘達六一·〇〇一·三六法郎，一九三二年盈餘達二四·五六三·三八法郎，</p>
<p>二，法美保險公司　該公司創立於一九三〇年，總公司設於上海愛多亞路七號，執行部在上海外灘一七號，其經理處在安南者有Seigon，Hanoi，Haiphong，及Pnompenh，四處，在中國者有天津，青島，漢口等處，資本實收三百五十萬法郎，至一九三四年底止，法定公積金針一〇七·一三一·八七法郎，各項賠欵凖備金計九六二·五八〇·五〇法郎，其資產總額約五百萬法郎，但其半數均係美亞保險公司所投資，該公司營業，注重於安南各埠，專保水火汽車玻璃繭鈔等險，一九三四年共收保費二·四六八·一五九法郎，　事長兼監察人係Siganl　M.E.法國人，建業地產公司董事，Stan　C.V.美亞保險公司董事長，紅理為Obakiewicg　M.W.副經理為朱繼聲君，</p>
<p>D，嗬囒商：嗬囒保險公司，多歸上海保險行Shanghai　Insurance　Office及望麥保險公司Java　Sea　&amp;Fire　Msurarice　Co.Ltd.，兩公司代理，茲將兩公司內容概述於下</p>
<p>一，上海保險行，總行設於上海四川路二九九號，分行設於天津，漢口兩處，經理水火保險，資本華幣五萬元，其股東為Roelof　anton　Rrentan，嗬囒人，曾任該國駐滬領事現為北美洲保險公司遠東總經理，嗬囒人，曾任該國駐滬領事現為北美洲保險公司遠東總經理，嗬囒商會　事等職，其另一股東並兼經理為L.J.Klaili君，該行營業，完全成代理性質，每年保費收入平均達華幣二十萬，每年凈盈自二三萬至五六萬元不等，其代理行家有British　America　Assnr　Co，Century　Ins，Co.Ltel，Eagte　Insurance　Co　Ltd，等十四家，</p>
<p>二，望賫保險公司　該公司成立於一八六一年，為有限公司組織，資本一百二十萬法郎，總公司設於巴搭維亞，Baavis上海分公司設於新康路三號，其上海經理為Van　Somern　H.C.A.君，每年保費收入約五十萬法郎，一九三〇年盈餘三·九六八·四三法郎，一九三一虧鈍二〇·九二三·二七法郎，一九三二，盈餘六〇·八四七·一五法郎，</p>
<p>E，日商及其他：日本保險公司，在滬係歸三井，三菱及康泰The　Cornhill　Ins.Ltd.代理，三井三菱兩公司內容不詳，至康泰在名義雖為英人所設立，但實際上係日人所主持，其資本總額五十萬金磅，實收二十五萬金磅，總公司設於倫敦，上海分公司設於外灘一八號，每年保費收入約八十餘萬金磅，其幕後支持者則為日商東京保險行Jokyo　Ins.Co.Ltd.</p>
<p>上海經理　Aaki</p>
<p>至其他意瑞奧等國籍之公司，在滬勢力極為薄弱，茲不多贅，</p>
<p>三，華商保險公司之慨觀</p>
<p>近數年來，國人因感受外力之壓迫，對於保險之投保，漸有傾向於華商保險公司之趨勢，復因年來農村破產，資金急速集中都市，銀行界以資本過剩，除競投於地產公債等投機事業外，復以鉅量休聞資本，投之於保險業，以是華商保險公司，乃得勃興，若干金融家，洋商保險公司之買辦及有保險經騐之事務員，均聯合有資力者競設保險公司，故最近華商保險公司竟多至二十餘家，茲將在滬各分總公司列表於下，</p>

<h3 id="c171">中英國際擊彈　中華連勝錦標第四年　得點總計——二八八五比二七一七 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>李公潁昨勝貝納爾六百比四九一　貝納爾創造七十九點這最高紀錄</p>
<p>第四屆中英國際擊彈錦標賽、昨日最後一塲、經彈王李公潁之最後努力、以六百點比四百九一點擊敗英人貝納爾、中華隊繼續保持第四年連勝之錦標、兩隊得分之總數爲二八八五比二七一七點、中華隊計得勝一百六十八點、雙方相去不遠、比賽興趣、亦彌覺濃厚也、昨日貝納爾在第二十八槍時、突創造七十九點之本屆最高紀錄、獲得仁記洋行所贈之銀杯、賽畢由徐均益夫人行給獎禮、第四屆中英擊彈、遂於歡呼中閉幕、昨日銀行俱樂部擊彈室中、濟濟一堂、觀者滿座、亦盛事也、</p>
<p>盛衰不同　先由林康侯致詞畢、比賽隨之開幕、貝納爾首先開槍、李公頴繼之、三槍結果、貝納爾竟一無所得、至第五槍尙未開紀錄、李則於第三槍即得五十四點之鉅數、成七十三與四之比、貝納爾仍鬱鬱不得志、至第十槍、李又獲五十八點之一槍、積成一百七十二與三十二點之比、相差達一百四十點之鉅、可謂兩人極度盛衰不同之時代、</p>
<p>創新紀錄　貝納爾在此鉅創之下、雖奮起有心、上進無術、至第二十八槍時、兩人之比數爲二百九十六比二百二十九、貝納爾之機會、初見蒞臨送紅自落、在非常巧妙之槍法下、遂一氣呵成擊出七十九點之最高紀錄、而以二百九十六點比二百六十九點、相差二十七點之極小數下、一躍而趕上、是爲比賽最緊張之一時期、</p>
<p>勝利確定　貝納爾雖得此鉅點、惜乎以後、即不能繼續、而李公穎則接連又得四六與三十六之兩槍、又躍居前茅、第三十六槍李得六十點、比數成四五八與三六三、、相去又遠、貝於四十一槍得六十五點、仍落後四十留分、旋李亦努力冀創最高之紀錄、惜乎决槍得六十四點而止、此時中華隊之勝利已吿確定、中華隊所差之分數亦微、彈王新紀錄之希望、亦祗能俟諸日後矣、最後比數爲六百比四九一、共擊四十九槍、</p>

<p>六·體育設施</p>
<p>該校體育館的設備在我國中藥中可稱是首屈一指了。就是有許多國內大學的體育館恐怕也沒有像該校那樣完美的設備。體育館內部面積很大，所有窒內各種體育敎學活動或籃球運動等均可在其中舉行。體育館旁邊尚建有體育指導辦公室，急救處，學生浴室，更衣室，厠所等。各室均接有水汀管，可通熱氣；所以就是在嚴寒的冬天，該校學生均可換着單薄的運動衣，到體育館中參加各種的體育活動，而不致受寒。</p>
<p>體育館內部的設備實屬新穎完善。進門靠右手的牆壁旁裝着一排固定的室內耐用肋木，下面放着爲肋木用的長櫈。另一排放着許多三尺左右體操用的長棒。再前面裝置一種爲銀鍊身體平衡用的大梁木：不用時可折合起來，不佔地位，需要時可移出使用。。另一角，裝置一種高低自在的鐵楨。後面尙有兩副爲練習手臂握力和攀登的垂直長梯。左面另有一扇通達操塲的門。門的兩旁裝置兩副爲練習手臂與胸部划運動作的機器。另有一角裝置一種爲練習拳擊的皮袋和大皮球。靠大門旁放着一副邁羅氏舉重鐵器，自五磅重起至三百磅重止，各種重量均備。體育館的四周樓上建有室內跑道。沿樓上跑道向外的圓柱上分配地吊着六根長的吊繩和吊環。其他各種移動的設備，如跳箱，跳馬，雙槓，棍棒，席墊等一應齊備。</p>
<p>該校因有完備的體育館，所以各種的體育活動均可教學進行。據該校體育指導說，該校學生平時所參加的體育活動包括：器械運動。機巧運動，球類運動，田徑運動，拳術，日本柔道，改正體操，以及其他臨時編定的遊戲活動與基本動作練習等。對於學生體育進展的成績常有記載，並在定時報告學生家長。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c212">藺相如和廉頗 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭侃嬨</p>
<p>藺相如和廉頗都是戰國末期的趙國人，一個出身貧賤，一個牛而貴顯。他們同生於七雄（秦·整·齊·趙·韓·魏·燕）並立的戰國時代。那時各國都要人才來開疆拓土或拒敵救亡，因此誰是能手，可誰便以因緣時會，得做卿相。</p>
<p>趙自武靈王死（周赧王二〇年，公元前二九五年）後，雖然多少還有一點積威餘烈留給後人。無奈此時「縱」散的解，強秦的積勢已成，趙國免不了要受秦國的脅迫。趙國的國民，弱者想媚秦以求苟安，強者則以媚秦為恥，臥薪嘗膽，努力想救國的方法。那時的藺相如和廉頗都是趙國的強者，只因處境不同，兩人救國的方法也不一樣。</p>
<p>廉頗是趙國一位戰勝攻取的良將，當然他有的是救國的機會。藺相如因為家境貧難，從少便寄養在太監繆賢的家裹。繆賢很得趙惠文王（武靈王的兒子）的寵愛，他有錢有勢，也學當時的顯赫卿相養起許多門下士來，不過他整天忙着去服侍惠文王，誰好誰壞他也沒法知道了。藺相如年長時便覺得做太監的門下士是羞辱的事，無如當時的社會太壞，不容易找出路；同時他愛國心切，急於替國家做點事情，不得不卑屈自己求達目的。他常常自己解嘲道：『個人名節事小，救國救民事大，如果我能學商鞅的興秦而興趙，卽使像他功成身滅，卽使後入鄙我鑽太監的門路出身，我也甘心呢』。但是他怎能使繆賢看得上他，把他介紹給惠文王呢？這確是一個難解决的問題。</p>
<p>有一天，他給繆賢賞識的機會到了。繆賢無意得罪了惠文王，他怕惠文王治他的罪，忙回家收拾細軟打算逃亡到燕國去。門下客聽見這個消息，怕擔干係，紛紛逃散去了，等到繆賢使人請他們商量，只有藺相如一個人出來應命。繆賢覺得他還有肝膽，於是將打算逃亡至燕國去的計劃告訴他。相如聽完繆賢的話，便阻止他道：『您老人家怎樣知道燕王一定收留您呢？如果他拒絕您，或者不以恩禮待您，到了此時，您走頭無路，追悔晚了！』繆賢答道：『我知道燕王一定會好待我的。我也曾跟從大王（指趙王）和燕王相會於邊境上，燕王得便悄悄地拉着我的手，說願和我結交，因此我知道燕王喜歡我，所以今日想去依他』。相如搖頭道：『您老人家弄錯了，因為趙國強燕國弱，而您老人家得到趙王的寵倖，所以燕王想和您結交。今兒您是得罪了趙王，逃難到燕國去。燕國怕趙國，一定不敢收留您，把您拘囚着送回來，這才是一條死路呀！您現在不如光着臂，背着刑具，向趙王請罪。趙王是一個仁柔的，他一定憐您而赦您的罪呢』。繆賢聽了相如的話，果然得着赦免，從此他認定相如是一個有識見的人，把他放在心上。</p>
<p>趙惠文王十四年，秦國有心滅亡韓國和吞併東周她曉得列國恨齊，因此拿齊國來做香餌，誘令趙·韓·魏·燕去打齊國。她計算等到打破了齊國，各國也就精疲力倦，更不能抵敵秦國，此時秦國可以為所欲為了。惠文王不知是計，不斷興兵去打齊國。打了兩年，輪到廉頗做大將，他非常的勇敢善戰，果然大破齊國，攻取了晋陽城。惠文王非常的高興，拜廉頗做上卿。</p>
<p>趙國久戰之後需要休養生息，不懷好意的秦，特地利用這個機會來和趙國搗亂。恰好那時惠文王得到楚國的和氏璧給秦昭王知道了，便想把牠詐取來。他使人送一封信給趙王，說願拿十五個城來換這塊璧。趙王接到信，馬上和大將軍廉頗等各位大臣商議。他們想拿這塊璧給秦國，怕得不到秦國的十五個城，白白受秦國欺負；想不給，又怕秦國興兵來強討，不知道怎樣才好。於是决定先找一個智勇雙全的使者去回報秦國一時找不得這樣的合式人才，趙王聽繆賢的介紹，召見藺相如趙王問相如道：「秦王要拿十五城來換寡人的璧，可以給他嗎？」相如答道！「秦強趙弱不能不答應他。」王又問道★「他拿了我的璧不給我城，怎麼辦呢？」相如解釋道：「秦國拿城來要求換璧，而趙國不答應，是趙國不對；趙國給了璧，而秦國不給趙國城，是秦國不對。兩方面比較一下，寗可答應了秦國，讓她受欺詐的罪名。」趙王也和相如同意，問他誰可以出使秦國。相如答道：「王一定找不到合宜的人，臣願意帶璧去。臣耍使趙國得到城才把璧留給秦國；吾則必定把整塊的壁完好地帶回來。」當時有許多看不起藺相如的人，都說他大言不慚，呌趙王不要聽他的話，趙王力排衆議，好容易才打發了相如出國。</p>
<p>相如辭了趙王，藏好璧，帶着幾個可靠的壯士，向西取道入秦去。相如在路上一壁走一壁想對付秦王的方法，樣子很嚴重，跟隨他的人，還以為他因為入虎豺的強秦，怕遭不測的禍，暗裹笑他胆兒小。其實他早已置生死於度外，此時她一心所關懷的只有「怎樣能不辱國」的問題。</p>
<p>他們來到秦國，秦王以為他的欺騙計策已經成功，看見送璧來的是一個文縐縐的使者，更令他一點戒備心都未有。相如來到的時候，他正坐在章臺和一羣美人娛樂，也就在那裹接見相如。相如親自捧着璧遞給秦王，秦王一見晶瑩的玉光，翠碧的異彩，非常歡喜，忙傳給美人和左右鑑賞，大衆都驚羨，圍着秦王歡呼萬歲。相如站在這裹像多餘了一個人，誰也沒空理會他。相如看出秦王無意給趙國換璧的城，他於是走上秦王的面前來說道：「璧有瑕呢，請讓臣指出來給王看。」秦王馬上拿璧給他。相如接璧，牢牢地握着退十幾步倚柱站着，面色變得非常可怕，額上佈滿靑筋，頭脹髮指，帽也戴不牢了。他就在這盛怒之下把頭抵柱，挺着腰，大聲指責秦王說道：</p>
<p>「大王您想得到這塊璧，差人送信給趙王。趙王接到您的消息，馬上召集全體羣臣商議，大家都說「秦國貪心，倚恃她兵力強，托辭來騙我們的璧，應許交換的十五城，恐怕不會得着的。」因此商議不給秦國璧。臣獨有異議，說，「布衣之交，還可相欺，何况大國嗎？而且只因為一塊璧，這樣小的事得罪大國是不應該的。」趙王才聽了臣的話，齊戒了五日，把璧和回信在朝庭裏鄭重地交給臣。幹嗎他要道樣幹？因為他尊重大國，特別表示恭敬。今兒臣到來，大王隨隨便便在章臺引見臣，禮節傲慢得很：得到璧，傳給美人看來戲弄臣，臣看大王無意給趙王的交換城邑，因此再取回璧。如果大王一定要迫臣，臣的頭和璧馬上在這條柱上撞碎給大王看。』相如說完雙手捧着璧，，眼斜看着柱，做成要撞柱的姿勢。</p>
<p>秦王怕相如眞的把璧撞破了，忙起來謝過，堅請他不要這樣幹。此時膽小的美人，驚得手忙脚亂，不等秦王下令已經狼狽地逃回後宮去了。秦王於是呌管版圖的官吏拿秦國的地圖進來，指定從這裹到那裹的十五城是給趙國的。相如猜出秦王是騙他的，當然不肯上當；但為着實踐他對趙王「全璧歸趙」的的言，和貫澈他的「不辱國」的中張，他不得不假意週旋秦王。他對秦王說道：『和氏璧是世所共知的寶貝，趙王因為怕大王，不敢不獻給大王。趙王送璧那時，齋戒了五天：現在大王也應該齋戒五天，在朝庭裹設九賓的禮，恭恭敬敬來接璧。這樣臣才敢把璧獻上。』秦王知道不能從相如手裹強把璧搶來，只得答應了，請相如住在廣成傳舍等候</p>
<p>相如回到客舍，得了自由，他猜想秦王雖然答應他齋戒，將來一定負的不給趙國城邑的。於是他使跟他來的一位壯士，穿着褐布的衣服，扮作小客商的模樣，把璧藏起來，從小道逃回趙國去。</p>
<p>秦王齋戒了五天，在庭裹設九賓禮引見趙使者藺相如。相如看見秦王，一點也不害怕，先謝了秦王的盛禮然後很率直的對秦王說道：『秦自從繆公以來，一直經過二十多個人君，未曾有一個實實在在履行國際信義的。臣很怕受了王的欺騙，對不住趙國，因此差人把璧先送回趙國去。您看，秦強趙弱，大王差一個使者去求換璧，趙國馬上就把璧獻來，完全不怕上了大國的當。現在以秦國這樣強，先割十五城給趙國，趙國那裹敢留着璧得罪您大王呢？臣知道騙了大王罪當誅戮，特地親來請死，望大王和羣臣好好地計議一下。『秦王和他的羣臣，出乎意外聽見這樣的話，面而相覷，又驚又怒，各人都切齒發恨聲。相如神色自若，回頭看，看跟他同來笑過他膽小的壯士，已經嚇到面無人色了。</p>
<p>過了一會，秦王氣也平了，他的左右要處死相如，秦王對他們說道：『現在殺了相如，終竟也得不到璧，反而絕了秦趙兩國的交情，不如厚待他，使他好好地牛回趙國，趙王那裏肯因一璧的緣故來騙秦國呢？』結果以禮引見相如，送他回國。相如回到趙國來，趙王因他出使不辱國，以為他賢德，拜他做上大夫。後來秦國不給趙國城，趙國也不給秦國璧。</p>
<p>過了幾年，秦王使人來告訴趙王，要在西河之外澠池和趙王相會，藉以聯絡感情。趙王怕秦，想不去，相如和廉頗以為王不去是表示怯弱，大辱國攛掇趙王成行，趙王只得和相如一塊出國。廉頗親送他們來到國境，和王訣別道：『王這决出行，臣計算過連走道和聚會的時間也在內，不過三十日就該回到國裹來，如果三十日還不見王回來，臣請立太子做國王，使秦絕望。』趙王曉得這是保國固權的最好方法，當然答應他</p>
<p>秦王這决請趙王相會，實在也是不懷好意的，他本來想等趙王說一個「不」字，好借端興兵去打趙國，想不到趙王居然敢來赴會，反使他自己難為起來。他决定改換方針，在會塲裹借事來羞辱趙王一塲，使趙王沒臉回國。不想趙王的丞相是藺相如，他萬事合禮，一點破綻也不露出來。但是秦王一定耍找一個機會來羞辱趙王。秦王飲酒到了將醉的時候，裝成很和善的對趙王說道：『寡人聽聞趙王很好音樂，請賜奏瑟！』左右承機獻瑟給趙王，趙王不知秦王有心開他的玩笑，以為逢塲作興未有什麽關係，便順手接着瑟彈起來。趙王鼓瑟完，秦御史走上前寫着『某年月日，秦王與趙王會飲，令趙王鼓瑟。』藺相如知道趙王中了計，忙走上前來說道：『趙王聽說秦王長於秦聲，請取盆缻來，讓秦王和趙王互相娛樂。』秦王生氣，不答應，於是相如自己去拿缻跪送給秦王，秦王不肯擊缻。相如扳着面孔大聲地對秦王說道：『大王若不肯擊缻，表明大王存心侮辱趙國，旣是那樣，相如就要在這五步之內，把頸上的血洒在大王身上了！』秦王左右想殺相如，相如睜大眼睛怒叱他們，他們都驚退了。泰王非常難過，沒有法子，祇得勉強為他打一下缻。相如回頭呌趙御史寫道：『某年月日，秦王為趙王擊缻。』秦的羣臣請趙王以十五城為秦王壽，相如也請秦王以秦的國都咸陽為趙王壽。針鋒相對，趙始終不示弱。秦王又看見趙王盛設兵衛，知道趙國早已有備，也不敢輕舉妄動，祇得自認晦氣，讓趙王平安回國去。</p>
<p>趙王回到趙國來，因為相如有大功，拜他做上卿，位高過廉頗，廉頗不服道；『我做趙將，有攻城野戰的大功，藺相如不過靠一點口舌之勞，現在他的職位居然高過我，那裹有這樣的道理！而且相如本來是一個賤人，我反在他之下，我怎能不羞呢？』他又宣言道，『我看見相如，一定凌辱他。』</p>
<p>相如聽見廉頗這樣說，不肯和他相會。每輪到朝見時，相如總是托病，不想和廉頗爭位置。相如外出，如果遠遠地看見廉頗，馬上就改道避他。相如門下中人覺得相如這樣怕廉頗是奇恥大辱，勸諫相如道：『我們之所以離別親戚來服侍您，不過是仰慕您的高義。現在您和廉頗同列，廉君說您閒話，您魷躱避他，怕到了不得。這樣幹就是平常人也覺得羞恥，何况是將相嗎？我們不肯，受不了，特地來和您告辭。』相如問他們道：『諸君看廉將軍和秦王誰利害呢？』他們異口同聲地答道：『廉將軍比不上。』相如於是進一步對他們說：『你看，以秦王的威勢，相如敢當廷叱他，凌辱他的羣臣。相如雖然不中用，那裹會獨怕廉將軍一個人呢？不過我想，強秦之所以不敢加兵於趙國，祇因為有我們倆在，今兒兩虎相鬭，勢必不能俱生。無論我們倆之中死傷了誰，秦兵早晚就會來到趙國的邊境。我之所以寗可自己吃虧，不肯和廉將軍打架，是想先國家的急難，而後私仇呢。』相如的門下士到了此時才恍然而悟，驚嘆相如的偉大。</p>
<p>相如的話，很快便傳到廉頗那裹。廉頗聽見羞愧到無地自容，不斷的自責道：『我才是眞小人呢！我才是眞小人呢！』。於是他托賓客和相如疏通，赤着膊背着荊條，親自上門到相如那裹謝罪道：『鄙賤的人，不知道先生寬厚到這樣呢！『相如聽見廉頗這樣痛悔的話，也不覺感動到流淚。後來兩人非常相好，趙國也因為他們的合作而蒸蒸日上，沒有誰再敢來欺壓了。</p>

<h3 id="c213">貧非罪劇本之修改 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 向培良</p>
<p>上海劇院這决公演貧非罪，是根據鄭振鐸的譯本而修改的。修改的地方，計有三類。</p>
<p>語句的修改，幾於到處都是的。因為鄭氏的譯文，多不合於口語。欲求在舞臺上說得明白流暢，勢非於詞句之間，隨時加以修改不可。並且，有時候詞句雖合於口語，而恰恰已合於演那角色的說話，也非修改不可。我不懂俄文、故只能以　譯為根據、力求不失原意而巳。人的名姓，也都修短了。</p>
<p>歌詞都完全編過了，因為原譯太長，字句累贅，無法製譜。原劇歌也太多，不能不略加刪併，以求在舞臺上不太冗漫。經過刪併之後，約省去了三分之一的歌，只留了了十支歌，以第二幕為多，第三幕則只有　個大合唱。</p>
<p>重要的修改還是在第二幕情節之變動，第一幕除了刪去兩個歌之外，無所更改；第三幕幾乎绝無更動；第二幕即不刪去了一段，也增加了一段。刪去的部份為客人中的兩個老夫婦，唱歌的老人，帶熊來耍把戲的人等。增加的部份　為開幕以後不久郭平上場的一段。原劇第二慕郭平並沒有上場。</p>
<p>阿斯成洛夫期基寫這個劇本，除了主題之外，還特別注意表現聖誕節的地方風味，他極力造成一種村鎮裹過聖誕節的空氣，在作者意思，或者是和幾個老婦人同情的，愛好那些古老的素樸的東西，而與徒慕虛榮的郭台，何理嘉之流相抗，就民族的意義來說，則郭和他那浪費了一切的弟弟恰恰相似，所以作者要把他挽回來。</p>
<p>只是這一層意義在我國舞臺上是無法表現的，這一種地方性的聖誕夜的空氣，莫說我們無法造成，就能辦到，仍然於我國的觀衆是隔膜的。那些歌，在俄國是盡人皆知的民歌，故聽來親切有味，不厭其多，到我國就不然了，例如要把戲的人及熊，縱然能找上舞臺，但除破壞全劇空氣之外，不會再有什麼結果的，所以我們大膽把這一部份刪除去了。</p>
<p>剛才已經說過，原作者之所以極力描寫聖誕的空氣，决不是僅圖舞上的熱鬧，而是表現一種鄉村原有的素樸風味與羨慕外來的虛浮的文明之對立。鄉間熱情的天眞歌舞與莫斯科的樂隊家製的甜酒與香檳酒，故鄉誠篤的少年與專裝門面的偽商人—這一切的對比。我們旣然把創造空氣的一部份情節去掉了，必須設法把這損失彌　起來，以期不至减少原作的力量，所以加了郭平上場的一段。</p>
<p>這一段是根據第一幕最後的一段對話寫的，郭平會向米德亞說得他要求哥哥收容他，不見採納，所以我們就拿夾在舞上實際表演，把郭台何理嘉的集團與另一集團，郭太太，她的女兒，郭平，以至奶媽等人，相互之間的對立性更強化兩方面的衝奕更加顯明，則作者的原意，或者可以多表一點。</p>
<p>至於米德亞和郭葉的　愛事件，本來不過是穿揷起故事的綫索而已，並不重要。所以我們也仍期舊貫，就在導演上也不對這一部份特別表張，而多注意於兩集團的對立。</p>
<p>我們希望這種改動，不至於使原劇受到太多的損失。</p>
<h3 id="c214">奧斯特洛夫斯基不朽的特點 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 謝天</p>
<p>在各方面，我們感覺到奧司特洛夫斯基氏獨特的價值，他所著的東西凡四十部中，都有其超越手腕的戲劇性，每個劇裹的人物，都是很自然的出現於適合的空間，每個故事也是那樣的純樸而緊凑的發展着，最顯著的一點，是透明地給觀衆以每個人物自始至終一貫的個性，及其充份而活潑的表現方式，我們勿庸贅言，這是他在劇作界不朽的特點。我認為他才是一個為舞臺而戲劇的人才，這些優點絕不能與一般僅有文學性的如梅特林克，蕭伯納等所能一概而論的。</p>
<p>從他的優處，我又想到我國水滸傳的優處是一樣的。水滸傳的一百零八條梁山好漢，每人有每人的語調，看到誰的話就曉得是出於誰的嘴裹，奧氏的脚本也就是這個樣子，每個角色在故事的需要及觀衆理想中出現，也就巧妙的以每個人的個性來對付劇的環境，絕無張冠李戴，揷不進的意識隨便放在某一個入的身上的弊病。如「貧非罪」中何理加與郭平兩個型卽是一個顯明的例：何理加：我决不讓我自己無故受辱，你要來跪在我的面前，求我娶你的女兒，是的，哈哈哈，你會這樣做的，我知道你，你祇要有一個好的結婚禮，嚇嚇鄉下人，你連吊死你自己也願意，但是，沒有人要她，多麽不幸呵！哈哈！」郭平；「我應該怎麼樣在大風雪雪裏自立呀」與「讓路！郭平走了！」</p>
<p>奧氏的確是把人物描寫到刻骨入微的境地了。</p>
<p>「貧非罪」整個劇也是誧張的那麽熨貼，更如第一慕中少年們愛的衝動時之細膩，第二三幕中郭台於資本家生活之追求，以米地亞，郭太太，及郭葉娜等之受封建制度之重壓下的痛苦，整個揭露俄國虛偽社會之罪惡（中國現社會似如此）。是啊，何况奧氏不是一個以藝術至上之主義者，我們更應怎樣來結定他的價值呢？這位可貴的人才的著作，在中國我們這一决「貧非罪」的演出，尚是第一次的介紹，我們感價到是多麽的合適同榮耀啊！</p>

<h3 id="c215">桃汛緊迫 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 筱山</p>
<p>俗語說過：禍不單行」，中國連年受到內戰的兵災，受到列強的壓逼，民生經濟，已走到絕路的時候，我們穩可以看得到，農村都市經濟的破產，失業　·餓，到處皆是，如今，水災旱災，又更為緊迫的來臨了。</p>
<p>這是很值得我們注意的問題，過去黃河的水災，波及西北和北方的幾省，滿目荒凉，如今，黃河的水位又高漲，治河委員會如何的努力的去設法施救，那巴朝夕不保的狀况了。而我們所看到的，除了治標的一種方法以外，根本的辦法，還是沒有，在不幸的大衆們眼前出現這種「墨守舊法」的治河的方針，簡直沒有一點兒的希望，而大衆們只有待斃而已。</p>
<p>在長江，我們更感到危機，去年湖北及其他的地方大水災，所給我們的痛苦，已到了萬二分的程度了。我們日把數日來看一看——被災面積四萬四千八百七十萬公里，被災農田七千零二十七萬三千一百五十九畝，被災人口七百一十四萬九千七百一十二名，損失糧食價值九百零六萬三千元，棉花價值五千零一十二萬二千元。——這個數目是單單湖北一省而言。如果說及其他相關的省份，那數目眞是不敢設想的。然而，長江——允其是湖北一省——現在桃汛又來了。而且非常緊逼的來臨了。我們記得，去年漢口，武昌，漢陽三埠的防堤工作，在數月的努力中，而仍不能抵得過水災。今年，桃汛都是一樣的危機，連日漢口方面的電載，水位高漲，水標記載在八·三公尺以上。由此可見，去年的水災，又將來一决了。</p>
<p>然而，這無數的在死亡錢上的人們，是希望着當局者不能老是用一種舊方式來處理，應從整個的改造上去着想。而目前過渡的防堤工作，更希望特別注意！</p>
<h3 id="c216">一個人的失敗 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 舒芒</p>
<p>初春了：太陽悠閑地鋪在村子裹的被翻笆過了的鬆鬆的土地上，讓烏兒自在地在裹面跳躍，讓孩子們呌囂地在裹面嬉戲，讓白了頭髮的老人們出神地在裹面追憶陳舊的過往的日子：那眼淚，那歡笑，那困苦與艱難……</p>
<p>老人們是有着那種僻性，那種習慣的：在日光中，在陰雨的天氣之午後，在昧旦與薄暮，在午夜的夢裏一决决反復不斷地，去翻過往的生活之書頁—追憶它，想像它，咀嚼它，像一個貪吃的孩子那麽地，狂吞那過去的生命！</p>
<p>「過去有那麼久了啊…」一聲嘆息，把日光裹憇息着的烏雀驚得四散地飛去，五阿爹又想起那些不可解的，在他看來是頂眩迷的事情—那命運，那生活—來了：「自己是快死的人了，命運仇恨了我一生，而日子依舊是那麽的難過…</p>
<p>「日子依舊是那麽難過」，那倒是眞的。譬如說，二年前五阿爹還在當一個催租吏，雖然白了頭髮，耳朶也有一點兒聾，然而靠着他的「年老」，靠着他認識的人多，春上秋上往這小小的村落裹跑跑腿，日子也就那麼苦苦地過去了。「命運總是跟他作對，」誠如他所堅信的：「好的日子是不會來的啊。命苦，運氣壞，那有什麼辦法呢？」</p>
<p>「命運！」對於這六十歲的五阿爹，那始終是一個神秘的，偉大的，不可解的東西。他信任了一生的命運，可是，命運對他却始終是那麼的殘酷：「命苦，沒有法子呀！」</p>
<p>就在這「命苦，沒有法子」中，他底陰暗的一牛像　牛一般地，緩緩的爬過了。他信仰着命運，他畏懼艱苦的努力，他一開頭，就對世界退讓了。年靑的時候，不敢用力量來爭取愛過的鄉女做妻子「婚姻也是命裏註定了的」，於是，甘心地讓父母給他對了一門糊塗的親，那時五阿爹曾在夜裹哭過二决，可是以後，也很快的把一切忘懷了，因為：那也是「命」，人同命運是鬥不來的—是沒有法子的啊。（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c217">國防電影之完成 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>昨天，中宣部諸公召集上海電影界的負責人員，在市政府舉行第三次談話會，會塲的空氣很嚴肅，興奮，主賓之間的談話也很接近，懇切，使得會塲中無形間流露着精誠合作的精神。為中國電影前途着想，這自然是非常值得人高興的。</p>
<p>讀今天（二十一日）的報紙，知道「關於國產影片今後中心作風，决定三原則如下：　發揚民族意識，以完成國防電影之使命；　愼重採擇適合時代性之電影題材，以推廣國難時間電影教育之功效；　電影劇情之現實描寫，應充分協助新生活運動之推進。」</p>
<p>從國難發生以來，進步的有良心的藝人雖然在極艱苦的環境中，還是在「發揚民族意識，以完成國防電影之使命」這個目標下製作，這是顯見的事實；然而在這個目標下艱苦地製作着的，很遺憾地却祇有幾個進步的有良心的藝人，而那些被「冰淇淋論」所蠱惑的電影製作者，他們却拚命價地在所謂「生意眼」上用功夫，雖然，結果，所謂充滿「生意眼一的影片，還是不見得有「生意」。</p>
<p>現在，電影談話會有這樣三個原則的規定，那自然是非常之好的，至少，讓那些「冰淇淋論」者也可以知道，中宣部對於「國難時間電影教育之功效」，是如何的注意到，而對於「發揚民族意識，以完成國防電影之使命」，是如何迫切地希望電影界同入擔負起來！同時，也是證明，上海電影界的負責人員，是如何希望他們的編劇，導演，以及其他的工作人員，來「完成國防電影之使命」</p>
<p>本來，在國難日漸加深的今日，「國防電影」之迫切需要，旣成為不爭的事實了，那麽我們應該怎樣進一步的來完成呢？</p>
<p>提起「國防電影」，一定會有人會提出光明的義勇軍的尾巴來作為反對的口實，以為「國防電影」，盡於此矣。於是歸納到結論說，我們的「國防電影」早已有了，其效果還是並不見到，可見「國防電影」是不存在的。——或者，用反對「國防文學」那樣的理由來反對「國防電影」。</p>
<p>用光明的義勇軍尾巴來非難「國防電影」的存在，那顯然是「病急亂投醫」的說法。公式的地硬揷上一個義勇軍的尾巴，那固然是很可笑的，那固然是不瞭解藝術作品應該有內容和形式手法上的多樣性，然而要硬抓住這個弱點就作為「國防電影」不能存在的理由，那無論如何是不成立的。</p>
<p>而一個進步的藝術家？他不會死抓住一個題材不放，他懂得在為民族爭生存的原則下，藝術的地正確地去反映這個目標，我想這個也是不必我們多費說明的。</p>
<p>在談話會上，歐陽予倩先生提出了「劇本的審查，希望中央有一個審查範國及寫作的原則，使劇作者有所遵循」的問題，我以為也正可以成為中央推進「國防電影」的完成的問題，在談話會上决定的三項「原則」，不是正好作為以致審查範圍及寫作的「原則」嗎？</p>
<p>從這决談話會裹，我們是不僅看到「國防電影」的迫切需要，並且是可以看出中央及電影界的負責人員都很想「完成國防電影之使命」的，我們除希望「國防電影」不要成為這决談話會的點綴品，而成為「紙上談兵」之外，還希望中央對於「國防電影」的劇本和影片審查，能够從速從寬來處理，而對於外埠的雙重檢查，也有辦法來補救！</p>
<p>除「冰淇淋論」者及其被蠱惑者外，我相信每一個有良心的藝人，將都集中在為民族爭生存的原則下，來向我們的目標行進。</p>

<p>Kunming: President Chiang Kai-shek flew from Chengdu to Kunming at 1:10 PM on the 22nd. Earlier, on the 20th, various circles of the Yunnan Party, military, government, and academia had received news of President Chiang's visit to Yunnan and initiated a grand welcome. This morning, all officials from various circles, troops, students, and the public turned out en masse to greet him near the airport. It wasn't until 2:30 PM that they learned that the President had not made the trip, so they returned to the city. On the morning of the 22nd, they received definite news again. Long Yun decided that all military and government officials, party affairs personnel, and section chiefs of various agencies, more than a thousand people in total, should arrive on time at Wujiaba Airport to greet him.

<p>(Tianjin) More and more oil and gasoline are being smuggled into Tianjin. A total of 4,000 boxes arrived in the three days of the 20th, 21st, and 22nd, and the selling price is extremely low. British and American oil merchants Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco are greatly shocked and have sent personnel to Cangyan, the estuary, and Hebei East to investigate and propose a solution, requesting customs to stop it. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council has established inspection offices at various ports along the Cangyan coast. The authorities do not believe that this is happening. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Japanese sources, Qikou Zhaojiagouzi has no equipment, the coast is silted up, and ships cannot dock near the shore. There are many bandits on the Cangyan coast, and cargo owners are worried about security when unloading goods ashore. It has been decided to rebuild the Tanggu Wharf, with plans to build five berths and deepen the river channel to allow 450-foot warships and merchant ships to turn around, and to accommodate giant ships with a draft of 24 feet. This matter is being handled by the Tianjin Office of the Japanese Naval Base Department. Commanders of various warships in Lushun will come to Tianjin within days for a meeting to decide on the plan. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggled oil and gasoline are now being transported by the Changli Hebei East Company and wholesaled by a Hebei East Company on Taoshan Street in a certain concession in Tianjin. British and American oil companies believe that this is crucial to their main commercial interests in North China. If large quantities are imported, the British and American markets will be seized, and drastic changes will occur. (22nd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) British and American oil industry insiders have protested to the customs authorities because those engaged in smuggling in North China are importing large quantities of gasoline and kerosene without paying customs duties, which is greatly affecting their interests. It has been found that smugglers are transporting kerosene and gasoline to the "autonomous region" of Hebei East, where they only need to pay a quarter of the normal customs duty. It is said that most of these smuggled goods come from Dalian, and smugglers are making huge profits. It is said that 4,600 boxes of Japanese kerosene have been landed at Puhekou (transliteration), 10 miles from Changli, and another 700 boxes of kerosene have been landed at Donglizhuang (transliteration) near Qinhuangdao. These goods have been handed over to the headquarters in Qinhuangdao and Changli, who are in contact with exporters in Dalian. It is said that 2,000 boxes of kerosene and 1,000 boxes of gasoline have been transported to Tianjin, and it is heard that large quantities of oil will continue to arrive on the Hebei East coast.

<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke returned to Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd and spoke to reporters about the process of revising the constitutional draft. He first stated that the "President's overall administrative power" was originally stipulated in the draft, but some advocated changing it to "President's overall governing power," while others advocated changing it to "President's overall political affairs power." In his opinion, to avoid the five powers becoming one power, it is best not to stipulate it in the constitution. Vice President Chiang entrusted Chen Bulei to bring letters to Liang Chou, Ji Tao, Chu Cang, and himself, also advocating this. The Central Constitutional Draft Review Committee has deleted this article, and the Standing Committee can make a concrete decision on the 23rd. Later, he spoke about how some people believe that since the Legislative and Supervisory Yuans are governing power organs, the members of the two Yuans should not be elected by the people. Sun said that the President is also exercising governing power, so why is he elected by the people? He also said that if all members of the two Yuans are appointed by the government, they will become a government-used group. If all members are elected by the people and the two Yuans are not placed in the governing power system, then they will become a people's group. The current constitutional draft stipulates that the members of the two Yuans are elected by the people, precisely to communicate the opinions between the government and the people and avoid separation. Finally, the reporter asked if the reasons for some people's advocacy that another body representing public opinion should be established during the adjournment of the National Assembly were sufficient. Sun said that the purpose of this suggestion is to prevent the interruption of political power after the National Assembly adjourns. In fact, no parliament in the world meets all year round, and their political power has not been interrupted during the recess. Moreover, temporary meetings can still be convened to resolve important matters, so there is no need to establish another body representing public opinion. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Standing Committee is scheduled to hold its tenth regular meeting on the 23rd. Because Vice President Chiang is not in Nanjing, one of the standing committee members in Nanjing will be mutually elected to serve as chairman. It is heard that the most important item on the agenda is to discuss the revised constitutional draft. According to the constitutional draft, after several months of review and chapter-by-chapter discussion by the Central Constitutional Draft Review Committee, the entire review committee has already met on the 18th to prepare a review report to be submitted for discussion. If the Standing Committee can pass it on the 23rd, it will be sent to the Legislative Yuan for further textual organization and then presented to the National Government for announcement on May 5.

It is said that the population of the area is one million, and 90% are on the verge of death. The tragedy is not entirely due to natural disasters. In addition, in the 51 counties of the Longdong, Longnan, and Taohexia areas, those affected by disasters last year included 17 counties affected by floods and hailstorms, 7 counties affected by banditry, 3 counties affected by black frost and drought, and 1 county affected by landslides, with losses of 2,449,463 yuan, affecting 76,080 households and 439,673 people.

<h3 id="e34">SMUGGLING AND TAX REDUCTIONS <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— LIU</p>
<p>Smuggling in North China is becoming increasingly rampant, and its impact has already extended to Shanghai. The sale of sugar has always been distributed from Shanghai to various provinces. Now, the northern sales route has been cut off, and tax-evading sugar is being imported back to Shanghai, and the sugar industry is almost unsustainable. Woolen cloth and flour have also traditionally been sold in large quantities to the north. Recently, Japanese flour has flooded the Tianjin market, and the price of flour has plummeted. The sales route for woolen cloth has long since declined. In addition, the import of artificial silk, cotton cloth, sundries, etc., is all being hit by tax-evading goods from North China. If the Japanese succeed in buying the three textile mills in Tianjin, they will absorb as much raw material such as cotton as possible, and it will be difficult for our industry and commerce to gain any foothold in the North. If smuggled goods flow freely, the entire industry and commerce will be destroyed.</p>
<p>Observing that the suppression of smuggling is often obstructed, many commentators believe that this is a bargaining chip for demanding lower import taxes on certain goods and for seizing important positions for customs officers. The so-called development of the North China economy is nothing more than an attempt to monopolize the economy. Therefore, smuggled goods are imported from Eastern Hebei, gathered and distributed in Tianjin, and echo Yanqing. In the south, Shantou and Xiamen are used as bases, importing from Taiwan and affecting Guangdong and Guangxi. Central industry and commerce is already in the midst of this takeover and is threatened at any time. Even the normal trade of merchants from various countries has lost its room for development and is declining day by day. International commerce is based on the spirit of treaties. Merchants who evade customs duties are punished according to regulations. Even if some believe the punishment is too severe, it can only be done through consultation. There is no reason to use armed protection to interfere forcibly and not punish. Although the situation in North China today cannot be viewed as normal, if international status and dignity are valued, one should not be willing to ruin one's credibility.</p>
<p>Preventing smuggling lies in suppression, but suppression can only be used for smuggling without a political background. If we investigate and suppress too strictly, disputes will arise. On April 6 of this year, customs implemented a method of storing imported foreign goods at the wharf, intending to slightly restrict the mixing of smuggled goods. Some foreign merchants believed that the procedures were too complicated and expressed their dissatisfaction, openly stating that smuggling was the result of excessively high tariffs and that it was better to amend the tariffs than to prevent smuggling. The fact that China's customs duties are high or low and can protect its own industry and commerce does not need to be debated in depth. Even merchants from European and American countries do not believe that it is inconvenient. Therefore, those who quibble about the level of tax rates, their intentions can be imagined. We know that to achieve effective suppression of smuggling, the greatest effort is still needed.

<p>(Nanjing) This year is President Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. Leaders from all walks of life in Nanjing and Shanghai believe that President Chiang has dedicated himself to the revolution for more than 30 years. Since he led the Northern Expedition from Guangdong in the 15th year of the Republic, unified China, and established the capital in Nanjing, he has been troubled by the Communist Party's rebellion, internal troubles, and external troubles. President Chiang has worked tirelessly and is unparalleled in the world. Fortunately, the Red Bandits have gradually been suppressed, and the fate of the country has been preserved. There must be something to commemorate this. Therefore, a donation was initiated to purchase aircraft as a birthday gift. There have been various rumors about the donation method. In order to understand the truth, the reporter specially visited Mr. Ong Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, who made the following statement. President Chiang did not accept the birthday celebration from the beginning. His intention was that the age of fifty is the time when a person's energy is full and experience is rich, and it is a period for serving the country and society. Many politicians and military figures in various countries have served their countries after the age of fifty. In ancient Chinese etiquette, fifty is called "Ai," meaning "serving officialdom and politics," which is also this intention. Later generations were weak and often declined early. Before reaching middle age, they considered themselves old and no longer invigorated themselves. This trend should be changed urgently. As for the habit of extravagance, celebrating birthdays with music and wine, indulging in desires, and wasting useful wealth, this kind of bad custom should be corrected. However, aviation construction is currently an urgent matter. This is a major event, and the government and the people should work together to catch up quickly. People from all walks of life should recognize the importance of national defense, raise funds to purchase aircraft, and serve the country. This is different from private gifts and receiving gifts. For the people, it is an expression of patriotism, and the government can only go along with its beauty. Although the donation method is decided by the people's organizations themselves, the government definitely does not want to see any disturbances. The President has repeatedly warned that there should be no extravagant or coercive actions. Even the method of donating salaries for public officials is to be voluntary and not mandatory. (22nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Provincial Aviation Association plans to use communities and villages as units to raise funds in four categories of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 30 yuan, and 10 yuan to purchase aircraft for Chiang's birthday, with the deadline for reporting the amount to the association before the 10th of next month.

<p>(Hangzhou) Zhejiang Province's plan to issue 60 million yuan in public bonds for reorganization has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The bonds are divided into four categories, with 100 tickets in each category. Principal and interest will be repaid every six months. The annual principal and interest repayment period is set for April and the end of October each year. Because the issuance period of May 1st is insufficient, pre-dated tickets will be used first. The expenditure on debt expenses for the 24th year is more than 6.61 million yuan. In the future, due to the extended repayment period, the amount can be reduced to around 5.1 million yuan in the 25th year, saving 1.5 million yuan annually. (Special telegram, 22nd)</p>

<p>(London) It is learned that the new Romance of the Western Chamber, written by Xiong Shiyi, will premiere in Shanghai in August. All roles in the play will be played by male and female actors who can speak English. They will go to New York in October, where the play will be directed by Mr. Guest. Xiong recently went to New York to watch Guest direct the Wang Baochuan play. The success of the play in New York was the same as in London, so Guest hopes that the new Romance of the Western Chamber will premiere soon. After Xiong returned to London, he announced the news of the new Romance of the Western Chamber. Someone asked Xiong where he could find actors who speak English. Xiong replied that it would not be difficult to find them in universities in Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai, and Beiping. Mei Lanfang has agreed to assist, so it is possible to train a troupe as desired. After the training is complete, the play will be performed in English with Chinese flavor. Songs will occupy a large part of the Romance of the Western Chamber, and the music will be specially composed, incorporating old Chinese music. Therefore, a Chinese orchestra will accompany the troupe to New York. After the performance in New York, it is planned to premiere in London. This is currently being negotiated. Xiong has received many souvenirs in his theatrical life in London. The most valuable of these is a postcard of George Bernard Shaw's portrait, with Shaw's small calligraphy on the back, which reads: I am very fond of the Romance of the Western Chamber, which is far better than Wang Baochuan, because the latter is an ordinary musical drama, while the former is a lovely dramatic poem, comparable to the best dramas of our country's Middle Ages. However, this play requires delicate performance art, which only China can perform in the 20th century. Xiong is currently writing another play, the plot of which is a young Chinese student in a new era who joins the revolution and wields great power, then feels ashamed of the development of the revolution, and retires to the countryside to become a scholar again. This play will be performed in London before the end of this year. Xiong has also translated several Chinese stories into a collection, which will be published in London this autumn.

<p>Abyssinia: It is heard that the Abyssinian King is now gathering a large army in the mountains to the west and southwest of Taixi, trying to make a final effort to prevent Italian troops from peering into the Abyssinian capital. The public sees this army as a major threat to the Italian base camp in Taixi. According to unconfirmed news, Abyssinian pickets once rushed down from the hillside at night, killing Italian soldiers guarding the Taixi airfield and destroying 17 Italian aircraft. Italian troops failed to reach the Abyssinian capital on April 21. The public in the capital has calmed down slightly, and many people have moved back. The news from the southern front is very unfavorable to the Abyssinian army.

<p>(Geneva) The proposal for Mexico to withdraw from the League of Nations has already been received by the Standing Committee of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies and is scheduled for discussion today. League of Nations officials are extremely concerned upon hearing this news, believing that the motion will certainly be passed. Mexico joined the League of Nations on September 8, 1932, and was warmly welcomed by all member states. Subsequently, in 1932, it announced its withdrawal due to financial difficulties but later retracted the proposal. After the Italo-Ethiopian dispute arose, the Mexican government advocated implementing the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, agreeing to the oil embargo. The League of Nations failed to implement this effectively, leading to disappointment in most of Mexican public opinion, and a majority of its parliamentarians advocated withdrawing from the League of Nations.

<p>Britain Decides to Follow the League of Nations' Actions; Blocking the Suez Canal Considered. The House of Commons discussed the Italo-Ethiopian dispute last night. Liberal MP Mr. Mander rose and spoke in fervent terms, urging the cabinet to adopt a firm attitude towards Italy, stating that if the League of Nations were to yield to Italy, it would be tantamount to Britain yielding to it. For now, Britain and France should cooperate sincerely. Britain should provide France with concrete assurances that it is prepared to support France when the League of Nations Executive Council meets next month to discuss the Rhineland issue, and then ask France to agree to intensify sanctions against Italy, including implementing the oil embargo and blocking the Suez Canal. If France refuses, Britain will have no choice but to withdraw from the League of Nations. Several opposition MPs then spoke in succession. Finally, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne responded on behalf of the government, expressing disagreement with Mr. Mander's assertion that Britain would yield to Italy, saying, "Britain is acting in accordance with the League of Nations. If Italy wins, it is the League of Nations that yields, not Britain. Regarding the use of asphyxiating gas by Italian troops, if it is proven true, then the sanctions against Italy should not be relaxed. Britain is prepared to implement all economic and financial sanctions decided by the League of Nations. However, blocking the Suez Canal, although a bold move, is not comparable to collective action and may not be suitable for the current situation." After Lord Cranborne finished speaking, the House of Commons adjourned. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>

This request will naturally be made through diplomatic channels. Rumors that British Foreign Secretary Eden intends to visit Berlin are unconfirmed, as it is inconvenient for Eden to travel long distances in the current international situation. The British government also intends to continue active negotiations with Germany only after the French parliamentary elections conclude in early May. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) Renowned journalist Madame Tabouis recently published an article in the newspaper *L'Oeuvre*, stating that a British Foreign Office official believes that Foreign Secretary Eden intends to go to Berlin in the coming days to inquire into the German government's true intentions regarding European and colonial issues. The four points that the signatories of the Locarno Treaty should demand clarification on regarding the German memorandum have been drafted into questions by the British Foreign Office and have reportedly been sent to Berlin. Although this news has not been confirmed in London, Berlin claims it is true. German leader Hitler reportedly studied them the night before and stayed up all night, so he did not get up and attend to affairs until 11 o'clock yesterday morning. Madame Tabouis then said, "According to news from Berlin, foreign figures there believe that the merger of Germany and Austria may soon become a reality. The steps they plan to take are to have National Socialist Party members initiate actions in Linz, Austria, to create a stir, causing the Schuschnigg cabinet to be intimidated and invite some National Socialist Party members to join the cabinet. Then, the National Socialist Party can demand a referendum to put the issue of merging Germany and Austria to a vote. According to these figures, Germany does not want to participate in a general European agreement at this time, but if France can abandon the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact, as well as the treaties of alliance it has concluded with Balkan and Central European countries, then it will be another matter."

<p>(London) Prominent Conservative right-wing figure and former Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill recently published an open letter in *The Times*, defending France's adopted position, stating that Britain has placed France in a dilemma. Germany spent a huge sum of 800 million pounds on military expenditures last year, and it can attack France with heavy troops at any time. This is why France is in a state of anxiety. Its agreement with Italy at the beginning of last year allowed it to withdraw 15 divisions of troops from the southern border defense line and station them in the east, also to defend against Germany. If France now has a dispute with Italy, it will inevitably have to redeploy defenses on the southern border. However, the strength of the 15 divisions cannot be summoned instantly, and whether Britain is prepared to send several divisions to help France in times of need is uncertain. Is there a reason why the French government has adopted a compromising attitude towards Italy on the issue of sanctions? (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>

<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented the 1936-37 budget to the House of Commons today, with expenditures totaling £798,970,000, including £20,000,000 for temporary defense expenses. Revenues totaled £798,381,000. The budget has been passed in its entirety by the House of Commons. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain presented the budget to restore armaments, Labour leader Attlee and Liberal leader Sinclair both spoke out against it, but the House of Commons passed the budget and adjourned.</p>
<p>Labour's Attlee stated that the budget would lead to war and was unacceptable to the Labour Party. The Chancellor said that business was improving and things were going well, but this progress had been wasted on armaments. Increasing the tea tax was inappropriate. The budget was unwelcome and did not reflect the government's success in handling foreign affairs, but only its complete failure. Liberal's Sinclair stated that the financial outlook was more serious than at any time since 1931. Three years ago, the Chancellor described his budget as very promising, but now all that remains is a budget that eliminates hope.</p>
<p>Labour's Maxton criticized the tea tax and said that funds were allocated for military spending but not for social programs, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>While the sound financial principles on which the bill was based were widely recognized, not everyone in Parliament welcomed it. Many Conservative MPs, while recognizing the need for defense, admitted that such a budget was unavoidable but opposed the increase in income tax and tea tax. Key figures in the Labour Party expressed pessimism about future budgets after hearing the Chancellor's remarks on the cost of defense, anticipating that future armaments programs would require even heavier donations to cover them.</p>
<p>The Chancellor gave an 87-minute speech, outlining the results of the previous fiscal year. Everyone sat quietly and listened. The Chancellor estimated that total expenditures for the current fiscal year, including a supplementary estimate of £25,000,000, would total £797,897,000. He then explained his methods for raising new revenue to cover the increased spending: Raising the standard income tax rate by three pence per pound; increasing the tea tax by two pence per pound; applying the remaining £5,250,000 from last year's road fund. At the same time, the Chancellor made slight concessions to taxpayers with lower incomes, namely increasing their allowances. The Chancellor said that the government had decided to continue the tax rates for various major industries for ten years. He expected to eventually borrow to cover a portion of the increased costs on defense. He also said that the proposed tax increase should not be seen as unreasonable, nor would it harm the progress of commerce and industry or cause excessive hardship. He believed that the government's policy was an essential foundation for financial revenue and economic progress, enabling the country to cope with the large increase in expenditures without the need for large tax increases. The two major characteristics of the government's policy were the promulgation of tax regulations and the establishment of a low-value currency, which had made both British industry and agriculture stable. In the previous year, customs duties and domestic taxes totaled £303,342,000, £8,500,000 more than the original budget and £13,750,000 more than the previous year. Internal taxes were £404,899,000, £13,500,000 more than the budget. Death duties were £88,000,000, the highest revenue from this tax ever. This was not due to the size of the deceased's estate, but due to the high value of capital. This alone shows the restoration of confidence. As for the national debt, it decreased by £4,500,000 in the previous year, and liquid debt also decreased by £51,250,000. The exchange equalization fund continued to operate profitably. In the past three years, the cleaning fee for fixed debt has consistently been £224,000,000. Over these three years, he saved £32,000,000 from this fee to reduce the debt amount. Although he would have liked to increase the prescribed expenses for debt repayment, he ultimately felt that it was inappropriate. Estimated expenses for the current year: Civil expenditure £378,746,000; defense expenditure £158,251,000; supplementary defense expenditure £20,000,000; public subsidies £5,600,000; fixed debt clearing fee £224,000,000; other funds £11,300,000,000, totaling £797,897,000.

<p>(London) The *Financial Times* called it a "Spartan finance" budget. Londoners have understood the seriousness of the defense needs. However, the public regards this as a cheap insurance premium to prevent the dangers arising from the arms race. Except for government securities, which took the brunt and were slightly weak, the rest of the securities market can still be supported. The general public is satisfied that Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain has consistently maintained his orthodox fiscal policy. People in the financial community infer from the Chancellor's decision not to raise long-term debt that the government will rely on short-term borrowing to meet its needs until the source of short-term borrowing is exhausted.

<p>(London) The announcement by Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday that the tea tax would be increased by two pence per pound is not expected to result in a reduction in tea consumption. However, it is expected that demand will shift to lower-grade teas. As a result, the price of cheap tea has already risen by one farthing. It is speculated that the rise in the price of low-grade tea will reduce the preferential treatment enjoyed by imperial tea from one-half to one-third of the tax paid by foreign tea. Therefore, countries that do not restrict tea production, such as China and Japan, will feel excited and invade the British tea market with their cheapest teas, which is detrimental to countries that strictly restrict tea production.

As far as Foreign Secretary Eden knows, Russia and Manchukuo are now planning to establish a mixed committee to study the border issues between Russia and Manchukuo and Manchukuo and Mongolia in detail." Lord Cranborne also mentioned the mutual assistance agreement signed between Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia. He also said that the Foreign Minister of Siam recently issued a statement declaring that the country will maintain good relations with Britain, adhere to the principles of the League of Nations, and embrace the policy of international cooperation, which the British government is very satisfied with.

<p>(Tokyo) The *Hochi Shimbun* disclosed today that an espionage case involving an embassy. After being monitored by the police authorities since February 26, the embassy has arrested 17 undesirable Japanese elements to date. It is reported that they are all Communists. After interrogation by the police station, they will be sent to the prosecutor's office within days. These people are suspected of violating the Public Security Preservation Law and the Military Secrets Protection Law. This case can be regarded as a good example of the special plan taken by the embassy to prepare for the war of resistance against Japan. The embassy organized an espionage network, with Inoue, a Japanese translator in the embassy, managing everything under the order of the director of the information office of the embassy. The translator hired five people to copy various news about Japan's internal affairs and policies from newspapers and books during the Russo-Japanese War at the Imperial Library. Another arrested Japanese, named Kono, obtained a passport from former captain Ando, the leader of the recent Tokyo military coup, on February 26, to investigate the actions of rebellious and loyal troops and report to the embassy. The rest of those arrested provided various news about rural social religious issues in exchange for remuneration. All 17 people arrested are related to Communist activities.

<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, Conservative MP Mr. Hayes asked the government to make a firm statement that it would never consider returning any trust territory. Colonial Secretary Thomas replied that his and Chamberlain's recent statements on this issue referred to both imperial colonies and trust territories. Britain has no more interests or privileges than other countries in the trust territories. If the issue of transferring any trust territory arises, then the issue concerns more than just Britain, as Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa also have trust territories. The British government will never consider transferring any trust territory unless the entire issue of imperial trust territories is discussed at the same time. Moreover, this issue also involves France and Belgium. Furthermore, if there is a transfer, it must be discussed with the local residents and their interests must be taken into account.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance held a meeting at the Finance Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 21st to review the content of Finance Minister Baba's financial speech to be delivered at the special parliament, and decided on its principles. Because the financial speeches of past finance ministers have focused on explaining the budget and have failed to fully state the financial policy, Finance Minister Baba intends to avoid using detailed figures and statistics, strive for simplicity, and place its emphasis on clearly stating the fundamental financial policy. However, the method of presentation will adopt abstract explanations, and specific matters will be explained in committees and other meetings. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Baba is determined to implement the financial and economic policies of the emergency period through the unity of government and the private sector. He went to Kansai to discuss this issue with influential figures in the financial world. As the special parliament is about to open, he hopes to meet with financial tycoons in Tokyo. Under the mediation of Kosaku Shingo, he met with influential figures in the Tokyo financial world at the Hoshigaoka Tea House in Akasaka Ward at 7 p.m. on the 21st. Finance Minister Baba spoke of the seriousness of the current situation and expressed his determination to serve the country with his own body. Afterwards, he described his aspirations regarding various financial and economic issues. In this conversation, the Finance Minister mentioned the strengthening of national defense and continental policies, and public debt policies. Regarding the limits of national defense expenditure, the development of Manchukuo policy, the issuance of public bonds, and other policies, he expressed his opinions.

We are convinced that the prosperity of industry and the development of trade are the foundations for the progress of national fortune and the necessary conditions for stabilizing the lives of the people. We will devote our efforts to this area in the future, consider methods to adapt to the new era, and improve various undertakings in order to implement them quickly. If this new policy is implemented properly through the cooperation of government and the private sector, so that the Japanese financial world is not subject to drastic changes, then we are confident that the Japanese economic world will enter a new era that suits the national conditions and continue to operate and develop the national fortune."

<h3 id="e110">London *Times* Reports: Japanese Invasion of Mongolia Fails; The Case of the Rebellion of Pseudo-Officials Can Be a Clear Indication <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>(London) *The Times* reported today that four important officials in North Hinggan Province were executed for being discovered plotting a rebellion. This is the first clear indication that the Japanese have tacitly admitted that their Mongolian policy has failed. The fundamental reason for the failure of this policy is that it is implemented by Japanese who have little affection for the Mongols. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Agency said that North Hinggan Province of Manchukuo is mostly inhabited by Mongols. This province was originally part of Heilongjiang Province and originally belonged to Outer Mongolia. Therefore, although this place was changed to belong to Manchuria during the Qing Dynasty, the folk customs are completely Mongolian and enjoy considerable autonomy. After the creation of Manchukuo, the Japanese wanted to gain the cooperation of the Mongols, so they changed Hinggan to a province and appointed Ling Sheng and others as its leaders.</p>
<p>According to sources from the Kwantung Army, Ling Sheng not only colluded with Soviet Russia to overthrow Manchukuo, but also had a tacit understanding with Russian General Blucher during the Zhang Xueliang era due to the China Eastern Railway issue. According to reports, Ling Sheng, in his capacity as a representative last year, negotiated with Outer Mongolia regarding the border conflict in Belnur. This negotiation ultimately failed due to disagreements between Manchu and Mongolian opinions. According to the Japanese, Ling Sheng had a tacit understanding with the governments of Kulun and Moscow at this time. Since then, Ling Sheng has often secretly reported the movements of the Japanese and Manchu armies in Manchukuo to Outer Mongolia and Soviet Russia, which has caused great losses to the Japanese border troops. The Kwantung Army has imposed the death penalty and shot Ling Sheng and others without hesitation because their crimes are obvious. However, from the case of Ling Sheng, the difficulty of the Japanese ruling the Mongols can also be seen. After all, they have not yet been able to find a way to cooperate with the Mongols.

<p>(Washington) The government's tax bill, after being amended for the second time and debated for several weeks, was submitted to the House today. It is largely similar to the initial draft, with the difference being a reduction in the processing tax of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration from 90% to 80%. The full text of the bill is lengthy, totaling 249 pages and 62,000 words. The chairman of the Tax Subcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee, Hill, estimates that the bill will collect between 700 and 800 million yuan in taxes annually, which is 345 million yuan less than President Roosevelt's budget for the next three years. There are currently six factions in the House opposing the bill, indicating that it will face strong opposition. However, government leaders today predicted that the bill is expected to pass the House next week without any substantial changes. The bill will be presented to the House for open debate on Thursday, with progressives launching the initial attack in order to increase individual income taxes and lower the standard for tax exemption.

<p>(Tokyo) Dr. Umetaro Suzuki of the Japanese Institute of Physical and Chemical Research has been diligently researching the fuel shortage problem, and a glimmer of a solution has been found. It has long been considered that one solution to the fuel problem is to mix alcohol with gasoline. However, research has shown that producing suitable alcohol on an industrial scale is quite difficult. Japan has abundant and inexpensive raw materials that can be used to make alcohol, such as molasses, surplus rice, sorghum, and wood. Therefore, the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research and other research laboratories have been enthusiastically dedicating themselves to research using these resources. On the afternoon of the 20th, technician Yoshimura and others from Dr. Suzuki's research laboratory achieved excellent results in an experiment extracting alcohol from molasses. The alcohol produced was very pure, and it can be said that complete success was achieved. Furthermore, the production cost is very low. Following the examples of Germany and the United States, a bill to quickly propose the use of mixed gasoline is forthcoming. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Cleveland, USA) The Republican National Committee today nominated Senator Steiwer of Oregon to deliver the keynote address at the party's national convention in mid-June. The committee is currently meeting here to prepare for the national convention. Steiwer's selection to deliver the keynote address indicates that this year the Republican Party's presidential election campaign will focus on rural areas. The party believes that it has already secured a strong base of support in the industrial areas of New England and the Mid-Atlantic states. Therefore, it has decided to compete with the Democratic Party in the Western states. Although Steiwer is a lawyer, he has been involved in rural activities for many years and is a leader of the Republican rural faction in the Senate. Observers familiar with the situation also believe that this decision to select Steiwer is intended to avoid disputes between the liberal and conservative factions within the party. While Steiwer is not a progressive, he is known to hold relatively liberal views and does not belong to any particular faction within the party. However, he is quite close to Senator Vandenberg, who is considered a potential Republican presidential candidate. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e121">The Food of the Zhoukoudian Ancient Peking Man (Middle) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Original by Dr. Ralph W. Chaney, Translated by Chen Shaoyan</p>
<p>Because he was discovered near Beijing, he is called "Peking Man." The scientific name is: *Sinanthropus pekinensis*. "Peking Man's" skill can also be proven by the crude quartz fragments that have been found, because these quartz fragments were used as tools for cutting and scraping. "Peking Man" already knew how to use fire, as can be seen from the several feet of ashes, which were deeply piled against the cave wall. Perhaps the "Peking Women" were too lazy to move them out of the cave, so they just casually swept them there.</p>
<p>Several very meaningful discoveries have already been made in these accumulated ash layers. From the incompletely burned firewood, it can be recognized that they are the same as the plants that grow in northern China or other dry and cold areas today. There are also a large number of charred bone fragments, which indicate that horse meat, bison, rhinoceros, and other past animals produced in the Western Hills or nearby plains were cooked here. These animals no longer exist in northern China today.</p>
<p>The fact that these many animals were selected by "Peking Man" as food proves that this area was once a vast open plain, or perhaps there were woodlands alongside surviving streams, just like the semi-arid areas today. The fact that "Peking Man" lived in the cave and had to make fire to keep warm or cook what he ate can explain the low temperature climate at that time. During the same geological period, most of North America and all of Europe were covered by glaciers. Therefore, this era is generally referred to as the Ice Age in the history of the earth. At that time, there were no glaciers in northeastern Asia, because the weather was relatively dry.</p>
<p>More than twenty feet away from the most primitive residence of this ancient human, many various man-made quartz tools and bone fragments were discovered in the breccia. There was also a layer several inches thick, all made up of fragments of the hard shells of many fruit pits. From the texture on the shell surface, it can be determined that it is the shell of the *Celtis* pit, a small spherical entity, even smaller than a pea. So, how did these seeds get moved into this cave and crushed into fragments? This is a major and important question.</p>
<p>The modern *Celtis* tree is a small tree in the forest that grows in North America and Asia. Its greatest characteristic is that it grows on semi-arid foothills and near streams. Wind and running water, the two most common means of transport, would not bring these fruit pits into the cave. Similarly, it is impossible to assume that these *Celtis* trees grew inside the cave, because direct sunlight is an essential condition for the growth of various higher plants.</p>
<p>It seems undoubtable that this large number of *Celtis* pits were brought in from outside the cave, and the hard shells were crushed when they were eaten. Now the question that arises is: Who brought these hard pits into the Zhoukoudian cave? Was it the earliest humans or some other kind of animal?</p>
<p>The *Celtis* fruit has a plain appearance and looks like a small cherry, with a skin and pulp covering a hard pit, which contains the seed. In extremely arid areas of the United States, these fruits are used as food by birds, rodents, and Native Americans. Several kinds of trees and shrubs that bear large and sweet fruits are often harvested by the Native Americans in the Southwest at specific times.</p>
<p>Usually, the fruit is eaten in the same way as cherries. The skin and pulp are swallowed, and the whole pit is either discarded or chewed into fragments, with the larger pieces spit out of the mouth.</p>
<p>The most common use of this fruit is to add flavor to meats and breads. The fruit is crushed, the juice is squeezed out, and then it is cooked with other foods. Finally, the remaining hard shell fragments are discarded. If "Peking Man" ate *Celtis* fruits in the same way as described above, then we hope to find out the truth by studying the accumulated fragments in his cave.</p>
<p>Fossilized bones of rodents were also found in the Zhoukoudian cave. Therefore, it is suspected that it was these rodents, rather than "Peking Man," who brought the *Celtis* fruits into the cave, leaving the pits behind to accumulate. This is a possibility, and much effort has been spent on studying how similar rodents that live today open the hard shells of *Celtis* fruits to obtain the edible seeds inside.</p>
<p>Burnt firewood remains in the ash layer of the cave.</p>

Since construction began, more than 2,000 *li* of dirt roads have been completed. However, it was inconvenient to handle affairs with various parties in his personal capacity. After several meetings of the Political Council, it was decided to establish a construction committee to jointly promote progress. Currently, the construction projects in Hebei and Chahar provinces include water conservancy, agriculture, and mining in addition to highways. In the future, they will be gradually implemented within the scope of economic feasibility, and so on.</p>
<p>First Meeting: The first meeting was convened at 10:00 AM this morning. Matters reported: Committee member Wang Jingru reported that the project to dredge the central waterway and build embankments in the Yongding River Delta had been agreed upon with the North China Water Conservancy Commission, and a joint engineering office had been established to take charge. Preparations were complete, and work had begun. A record should be filed. Matters discussed: Men Zhizhong proposed that the detailed rules for the committee's work be submitted to the committee members for review. Wang Jingru proposed that the flooding of the lower reaches of the Jiutuo River in Hebei Province was harmful. Could the committee take overall planning responsibility and submit a request to the National Economic Council to allocate funds to mitigate the water disaster? Resolution: Approved in principle, to be submitted to Ji Liang, Fu Baoheng, and Wei Shaowu for review. Wang Jingru proposed to loan money for sinking wells to alleviate the drought disaster.

<h3 id="e123">Sharp Decline in Guangdong Province's Silk Exports: Rayon Fabrics Seize Market Share, Further Restricted by Heavy Foreign Tariffs <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) The black silk and gauze manufactured in Guangdong Province are excellent products for summer wear and are used both domestically and abroad. In previous years, when sales were brisk, they amounted to no less than several million yuan annually. Domestic sales extended as far as Hubei, Shanghai, and North China, while overseas sales were mainly in Southeast Asia. Tens of thousands of households were engaged in the weaving of silk gauze, with more than 100,000 weavers in Nanhai and Shunde counties. The shops that traded in silk gauze also had strong capital, ranging from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of yuan. Since the global economic downturn began, overseas sales have plummeted, while domestic sales have also shrunk due to weak purchasing power. Therefore, most silk gauze shops in Guangzhou have suffered losses in recent years. An investigation into the reasons for the decline in the silk gauze industry in recent years reveals several factors. First, foreign rayon is dumped into the market, and rayon fabrics seize market share. Second, foreign tariffs restrict exports, preventing them from flowing freely as they did in the past. Recently, the Southeast Asian market has been dominated by foreign rayon products, and Guangdong silk gauze has not found a way to restore its former sales volume. In Vietnam, since the establishment of the Sino-French-Vietnamese Commercial Treaty, not only have the previous harsh taxes not been removed, but they have become even more severe. According to a letter recently received by silk gauze shops here from their counterparts in Annam, detailing the situation, which has drawn the attention of those concerned about foreign trade. The letter from Vietnam stated briefly that since the promulgation of the Commercial Treaty, the customs duties levied by the Vietnamese authorities on Chinese silk have not only not been reduced, but have even increased compared to when there was no treaty. Various names are invented to impose arbitrary taxes. Taking Chinese silk as an example, under the old treaty, only the regular tax was levied. Later, when there was no treaty, it was collected at the regular tax rate, with a capital levy added in addition to the regular tax. Now, since the new treaty has been established, the capital levy should be abolished in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit. However, recently, the Vietnamese customs authorities have not only not removed the capital levy, but have also imposed a balancing tax, levied at 25% of the estimated value. For example, the comparison of old and new tax rates for every 100 kilograms of lightweight, dyed, pure silk fabric imported into Annam is as follows: (A) Under the old treaty, the tax rate was 1,360 francs in regular tax. (B) When there was no treaty, the tax rate was 10,000 francs in regular tax and 900 francs in capital levy, totaling 10,900 francs. (C) The recent tax rate after the promulgation of the Commercial Treaty is 8,500 francs in regular tax, 537.5 francs in capital levy, and 2,250 francs in balancing tax, totaling 12,287.5 francs. According to the above examples, it can be seen that after the signing of the new treaty, the import tax rate on Chinese silk in Vietnam is not only higher than under the old treaty, but is also considerably increased compared to when there was no treaty and the ordinary tax rate applied. Although the added balancing tax is said to be levied at 15% of the value, it is estimated according to the exchange rate, which is essentially arbitrary and has no standard. Sometimes, it even reaches 50%. The capital levy, on the other hand, is estimated after compiling all costs and taxes paid, which is essentially taxing taxes. Therefore, the amount of tax paid on imported Chinese silk generally ranges from 100% to 150% of the value. Currently, the Vietnamese market is almost devoid of Chinese silk due to these heavy tax restrictions. Silk gauze merchants hope that the authorities will negotiate with the French and Vietnamese governments to improve the situation, for the sake of business, the national economy, and foreign trade.

<p>(Special Correspondent Cheng Jun) Yangxin's Farms and New Villages</p>
<p>Yangxin suffered a great calamity; its fields were desolate. Recruiting farmers to cultivate the land is indeed a crucial plan. When this reporter arrived in the county seat, I immediately heard that a large-scale collective farm was established fifteen miles from the city. Due to the rain, it was not possible to inspect it earlier, but today's visit was satisfactory. The farm began preparations in August of the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935]. It repaired the houses that had been burned but not collapsed and established an office to manage affairs. The entire farm has approximately 1,400 mu of land, divided into ten districts, which began cultivation in December of the 24th year. This reporter went to conduct an on-site investigation, traversing each district. The section in Yanglinpu is where the office is located, with three earthen houses enclosed by bamboo fences. A small farmer with a knife guards the entrance. More than twenty disaster-stricken farmers are engaged in digging a pond. Inside the houses are offices, lecture halls, disaster-stricken farmer dormitories, dining halls, cattle pens, etc. Although the area is not large, the arrangement is well-organized. The farm currently has ninety-four disaster-stricken farmers, five female farmers, and four disaster-stricken children, divided into livestock rearing, kitchen staff, and special duty teams. The disaster-stricken farmer teams are divided into six teams, each with ten people, each with a team leader responsible for cultivation. The livestock rearing team has eight people, responsible for herding cattle. The kitchen staff team has five people, responsible for cooking. The special duty team has ten people, responsible for guarding and patrolling, all under military management. The farm grows rice, wheat, beans, hemp, sweet potatoes, etc., varying according to the suitability of the soil. The planned park also plants vegetables, fruits, and trees. When the reporter arrived at the garden, it was the height of peach blossom season, contrasting with the deep green vegetable plots. The lake and mountain scenery felt particularly serene. Beside it, dozens of disaster-stricken farmers were working diligently, building a road. These disaster-stricken farmers mostly come from the Mu Shi Gang and Pai Shi areas. Their parents and brothers were all slaughtered by the Red bandits. They survived the calamity and rely on this place for shelter, avoiding starvation. Their clothing, food, and shelter are all provided by the farm. Each month, they are paid wages of one to two yuan according to their diligence, eight yuan for team leaders, and twelve yuan for foremen. To prevent them from wasting money, a savings department has been established. In terms of education, they have two hours of classes on sunny days and six hours on rainy days, using the Thousand Character Classic as a textbook, primarily focusing on literacy, as well as basic arithmetic, abacus, general knowledge, agricultural common sense, and New Life Movement guidelines. At the same time, military training is emphasized. They conduct morning exercises at dawn and practice martial arts. According to the farm director, the farm has now reclaimed six to seven hundred mu of wasteland, with three to four hundred mu sown. The wasteland reclamation plan has now been changed, and it has been decided to reorganize into a new village, with the disaster-stricken farmers currently cultivating the land as the village masters, allocating land to each household and providing grain according to the number of people. Previously, it was for disaster relief, but now it is for a permanent plan. The current steps for building a new village are divided into three phases to be completed, each phase lasting one year. In the first phase, for the first season, they will still live a collective life, cultivate as much land as possible, and diligently practice military training. Disaster-stricken farmers' families are also allowed to come to the farm to work and be given food and work. After the autumn harvest, twenty excellent individuals will be selected, each given ten mu of land, provided with housing, and lent farming cattle and agricultural tools to help them become self-sufficient and start a family. At the beginning of the second phase, forty disaster-stricken farmers will be recruited. The disaster-stricken farmers who were not allocated land in the previous season will continue to live a collective life, reclaim wasteland, learn to cultivate, be taught etiquette, and be trained in military affairs. After the autumn harvest, forty of the most capable of becoming self-sufficient from the first phase and the best from the second phase will be selected. According to the method of the previous phase, land and housing will be granted, seeds and cattle will be lent, and families will be established. In the third phase, the residents within the transformation area will be tamed to avoid becoming obstacles to the new village. After the autumn harvest, forty households will be separated. In three years, a total of one hundred self-reliant households will be established, meeting the requirements of one bao of a political organization, and the governance will be returned to the bao chief, completing the organization of the new village. The total area of land collectively reclaimed in the three phases is 1,400 mu. Except for the thousand mu divided among the hundred households, the remaining four hundred mu will be collectively cultivated and planted by the villagers of the new village. The income will be used for the support of the elderly and weak in the former collective farm, as well as for the public welfare and education of the village. When the children in the former farm reach adulthood, they will also be allocated land from the four hundred mu according to their names. The important work in progress is, first, the construction of village houses, stipulated to be built purely with thatched wheat and rice straw and rammed earth walls, one house for each household, ten households forming a lian. Next is the purchase of equipment and agricultural tools, which will be given or lent. As for the handling of land rights, the government is requested to issue a notice requiring land owners to register their deeds within a certain period to confirm ownership, giving them a price of one yuan per mu. Those who are willing to join the new village will be allowed to work and enjoy the rights of villagers. Those who are unwilling will be recognized as landlords within three years. If they are unwilling to join and unwilling to rent, a wasteland reclamation fee of ten yuan per mu will be charged. After that, the land will belong entirely to the village. The crops planted in the fields are stipulated to be mainly barley, wheat, and soybeans, supplemented by vegetables. The four hundred mu planted this year will be barley, wheat, broad beans, and peas. In the autumn, sweet potatoes, mung beans, sesame, corn, sorghum, buckwheat, peanuts, and cotton will be the main crops, supplemented by early rice, late rice, dry rice, yams, and tobacco. In addition, because Yanglinpu was formerly used for vegetable gardens, it has been decided to develop a fixed nursery here, dredge wells and ponds, and create new irrigation canals around the garden, planting trees everywhere to arrange roads and support trellises. In front and behind the houses in the new village, attention will be paid to afforestation, mainly with [phase xiang?], all expected to be completed in three years. This kind of farm and new village is the only one of its kind in southern Hubei. It has already achieved preliminary results. Whether it can become a model new village for the entire province depends on the continued efforts of those in charge. (April 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e125">Anhui Province, Northern Anhui. Shouxian Experiences a Severe Spring Famine with Over 300,000 Disaster Victims. The Provincial Government Plans to Offer Agricultural Loans. <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Shouxian in northern Anhui has always been an impoverished area. The great flood of the 20th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1931] severely damaged the region's vitality. Furthermore, the disturbances by bandits and Reds have caused frequent unrest. The people have already suffered greatly, and their livelihoods are becoming increasingly difficult. In recent years, due to severe drought, the harvest of grains has been poor, and the rural areas have declined to the extreme. This year's spring famine is extremely severe. Most of the food relies on external sources, but neighboring counties mostly restrict exports. Therefore, the food problem has become even more alarming. Areas that previously hoarded grain have often experienced food grabbing incidents. Now, there is nothing left to grab. The total number of disaster victims in the county is estimated to be over 300,000. Elm bark, mulberry bark, cottonseed, and similar items have already been consumed. During the spring, people mostly use green grass, wild vegetables, neem fruit, locust beans, and sweet potato leaves to fill their stomachs. The areas with the most severe disaster conditions include Yaokouji and Yankouji in the first district; Zhuangmuqiao, Dashunji, and Chewangji in the second district; Shuangmiaoji, Yanliumiao, Lisanjiao, and Sanyiji in the third district; Yinxianji, Chongxinji, Yuji, Sanjuesi, and Shiji in the fourth district; and Banqiaoji, Gouqiyuan, and Suwangba in the fifth district. The provincial disaster relief committee has allocated over ten thousand yuan in relief funds, and expatriates from Shouxian have also donated over ten thousand yuan, which has been handed over to local officials and gentry for distribution. However, the disaster area is too vast, and it is a drop in the bucket, unable to provide widespread relief. Recently, with the gap between seasons, people are dying of starvation almost every day. According to local elders, the drought disaster in the sixth year of Xianfeng during the late Qing Dynasty was not as severe as this year. Recently, the Anhui provincial government plans to experiment with offering loans secured by farmland in the county, with an amount of fifty thousand yuan, to be handled by the local bank, as a plan to regulate the rural areas and relieve the disaster-stricken farmers. The local people of Shou eagerly hope for its early implementation to benefit the remaining survivors.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Chen Yi Tours Western and Southern Fujian to Inspect Party Affairs, Politics, Education, and Judiciary. The Round Trip Will Take Approximately Three Weeks. <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Provincial Chairman Chen Yi believes that since the Red bandits in western Fujian have been suppressed and the politics of southern Fujian are also very important, he has decided to personally tour the area to plan for restoration measures and arrange local security matters. On the morning of the 18th, at 7:00 AM, he, along with provincial government senior advisor Li Zeyi, staff member Lin Sixian, secretary Shen Mingxun, director Ye Zhongyun, adjutant Chen Zhuolin, and deputy director of the security office She Nianci, accompanied by a platoon of military police and a platoon of security forces, departed from the provincial government in nine cars of various sizes along the Fuxing Quanzhou Xiamen Highway. It is reported that Chen's inspection matters are divided into party affairs, security, civil administration, finance, education, and judiciary. Party affairs are the responsibility of Tang Demin, security is the responsibility of She Nianci, civil administration is the responsibility of Li Zeyi, finance is the responsibility of Lin Sixian, education is the responsibility of Shen Mingxun, and judiciary is the responsibility of Ye Jingyun. The counties to be inspected are Fuqing, Putian, Xianyou, Hui'an, Jinjiang, Nan'an, Yongchun, Anxi, Tong'an, Xiamen, Haicheng, Zhangpu, Longxi, Nanjing, Longyan, Liancheng, and Changting. The time is set for three weeks. He may stay overnight in important counties, while the rest will be visited on the same day. He will not accept welcoming receptions or supplies from local organizations or communities and will decline all banquets. During the tour, the provincial government affairs will be handled on his behalf by Civil Affairs Director Gao Dengting. After the tour, he will travel to Beijing to report the situation in Fujian Province to the central authorities. The recent situation in southern Fujian has attracted considerable attention from the outside world. Jinjiang and Hui'an counties, in order to prevent disturbances by traitors and bandits, have declared martial law, with the militia teams cooperating with the stationed troops to deploy defenses and inspect travelers and households very strictly. However, the local area is still quite peaceful. (April 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e127">Songjiang: Reckless Bicycles Cause Accidents <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the young son of Zhao Ayun, a resident of Huayang Bridge, was only four years old. While playing in front of his house, he was tripped by a bicycle ridden by a certain Jia from Jiangbei. The child's hand was caught in the spokes of the wheel, but the rider did not stop, dragging him for five or six feet. A screw on the wheel came loose and pierced the child's arm, about seven or eight tenths of an inch deep. He fainted from the pain, and the Jiangbei man finally stopped. It is reported that after the child was awakened by his family, he had a high fever, and his life is precarious. In the bustling market area around Kuatang Bridge, there have also been many people learning to ride bicycles, recklessly dashing around, causing accidents due to a lack of avoidance. Local people are hoping that the public security authorities will strictly crack down on this to ensure the safety of pedestrians.</p>

<p>Wu County Magistrate Deng Xianghai, in light of the fact that tenant farmers in Guo Xiang, Xiang Cheng, Xie Tang, Yin Shan, and other townships have, on the pretext of last year's poor harvest, refused to pay rent, and that last winter, a rent resistance riot occurred in Yin Shan and other places, causing the county's land rent collection to fall short, with a total collection of only slightly more than 50%, specially formulated a rent payment method, assigning Pan Renxian, Zhang Yijun, and others as rent collection committee members to go to Xie Tang and other townships, assisted by the security team, to urge the collection of land rent. Magistrate Deng also met with Renxian and the rent collection committee members in Guo Xiang on the 21st to summon and instruct the baojia chiefs, urging the farmers to pay rent, and returned to the city that evening. However, the farmers in the Xiatang Village area of the township misunderstood that the county government was using armed force to collect rent. At about 8:00 PM on the 21st, Wu Shengcun and over three hundred other farmers from the township gathered, each carrying torches and reporting to neighboring villages by banging gongs, inciting a riot to resist rent. Captain Shen of the First Squadron of the Security Team stationed in the township immediately led the team to suppress the riot upon seeing the torchlight illuminate the sky. He immediately sent a telegram to the county government to request instructions. The team captured Wang A'jin, the leader of the riot. The farmers became greatly dissatisfied, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Public Security Bureau." Lu En, the eighth district chief of the township, immediately notified the Public Security Bureau to send the water patrol team to rush to the scene overnight to strictly prevent accidents and continued to capture six farmers involved in the incident, including Wang A. Jin. Magistrate Deng reported the situation that night and specially sent the second platoon of the Second Company of the Seventh Battalion of the Security Team and the First Company of Mortars to the township overnight to suppress the riot, ordering them to act appropriately if persuasion was ineffective. The team arrived in the township at 1:00 AM on the 20th and fired a volley of shots into the sky as a demonstration. The farmers gradually dispersed and returned home. Small riots also occurred in Jintang Township, Jin Chen Township, and other places that night, but they were quickly quelled after suppression by the Security Team. Wang A'jin and the other seven people arrested in Guo Xiang Township were escorted to the city on the 22nd. It is reported that Magistrate Deng has decided to severely punish the stubborn farmers who incited the riot and were arrested to warn against lawlessness. As for the three violent farmers, Zhao Huquan and others, arrested in [Only, Wei?] Township, they were also transferred from the Public Security Bureau to the County Government for interrogation on the 12th.</p>

<p>The Wu County river and land police and the security team, due to the rampancy of bandits in various townships, held a large-scale patrol on the 15th of this month, but no traces of bandits were found. However, recently, lake bandits have become rampant again, and robbery cases have been frequently reported. Moreover, a robbery case occurred in the home of Mo Dasheng in Yuexi Huxi Township, Wujiang County, on the 20th. The bandits even used torture, pouring water into the victim's nose and burning their breasts. In addition, a robbery case also occurred in the home of Wu Yongxiang in Yanli, Huangdai Township. Zhou Weilie, the district chief of the second district of the river public security, believes that a joint suppression is necessary. A large-scale joint suppression will be held by the river and land police teams of the five lakeside counties of Wujiang, Wuxi, Yixing, etc., on the 28th, 29th, and 30th of this month.

<p>The Xicheng opium den outside Guangfu Gate, Hanchang Road, was accused to the Public Security Bureau of adulterating private soil. Director Chen sent police officers from the Supervision Department to search and seize various account books, receipts, and notebooks. The number of opium recorded in the account books was inconsistent, with many discrepancies. The evidence was sent to the county government for review. Subsequently, the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to subpoena Zhang Yinglin, the manager of the den, and Xue Xiajun, the accountant, for interrogation and bail. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau, by order of the county government, announced the closure of the den's building, revoked its license, and ceased operations. Inspector Li was sent to execute the order with the police. At that time, the opium smokers in the den were indulging in their habit. Upon seeing the police arrive, they fled in all directions. The den's Suzhou character Fifth Class A license, four account books, ten opium pipes, twenty-one opium lamps, opium paste with a tank weighing nineteen taels, and one hundred and thirteen paper-wrapped opium paste packets, weighing three taels and eight qian, were taken back to the bureau and transferred to the county government for review.

He specially submitted a report to District Chief Qian, requesting to resign. District Chief Qian persuaded him to stay. At the same time, all the township chiefs in the First District jointly submitted a report to the county government, requesting that the accuser be subpoenaed and punished according to Article 10 of the Provisional Regulations for the Prohibition of Opium and Punishment of Crimes of the National Government and Article 169, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, to warn against troublemakers and ensure the safety of the good and honest.</p>

<p>The traffic police at the railway station had a clash with postal workers yesterday.</p>
<p>Four passengers arrived at the Kai Tong [Open Traffic?] Bus Company and hired a car to go to Meiyuan Xiaojishan for sightseeing. A dispute arose over the car fare. Xia Ruyao, a police officer from the local police section, stepped in to mediate. It is not known how, but the police officer and Zhang Shihong, a driver from the company, had a conflict. At that time, postal worker Yu Wen was on duty outside the bureau and was riding a bicycle to deliver express mail when he was suddenly knocked down in the center of the road. Yu Wen immediately confronted the traffic police, leading to another clash. Police officers Zhu Jinfu and Yang Heng from the section heard of the conflict and came out to mediate, resulting in a direct conflict with Sun Yongchun, You Shiquan, Yu Guisheng, Yu Shousheng, and many other postal workers. As a result, both sides were injured. Five postal workers were taken to the section by the police and then released. They went to the local court to have their injuries examined. After examining the injuries, Prosecutor Shen ordered them to be sent back to resolve the matter themselves. The postal workers' union has decided on three principles for mediation: 1. Medical expenses; 2. Covering wages for workers replacing the injured; 3. Publishing an apology. However, the traffic police section has not accepted the above principles, resulting in a lack of resolution. The postal workers' union convened an emergency meeting of all committee members that day, chaired by Mi Fengyi, to discuss countermeasures. The atmosphere was tense. It was decided to send an official letter to the National Postal Workers' Federation and the general union's Beijing office for support. At the same time, a report was submitted to Du Jiahua, the postal director of the capital, and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police Department, appealing for fair treatment. It is reported that postal worker Yu Guisheng suffered injuries to his head and lower abdomen, and Yu Shousheng suffered injuries to his waist and other places. Their injuries are serious, and there may be a danger to their lives.</p>

<p>The labor-management dispute at Runfeng Rice Mill, after the labor side's overnight petition, the authorities tried their best to mediate, but due to conditions, the two sides have broken down. Currently, all rice mill workers in the county are on strike, and white rice production has stagnated for three days, and the market situation has been trending higher, affecting the entire society. The Runfeng Rice Mill dismissed four workers, including Zhang Yinchang, and hired non-union members to work, and the union protested, and the dispute lasted for more than eight months without resolution. The night before last, some workers went to the county government to petition, requesting the implementation of the worker's reinstatement, but the section chief of the county government was unable to resolve it, so the workers stayed overnight without dispersing. A telegram was sent to Chief [surname missing] Chen Fu, who was training in Beijing, to return to Changshu for negotiations. Chen returned on the 21st and urgently convened a meeting of labor and management representatives. According to the county magistrate's intention, three points were decided: 1. Runfeng Mill will reimburse Zhang Yinchang 200 yuan, ordering him to resign voluntarily; 2. The hired workers will be introduced to the union by the factory; 3. The machine workers' union will select one more member to be employed by the factory. On the one hand, the machine workers' union will apologize to the factory. However, the labor representatives believed that they were not satisfied, and representatives Zhang Tongyuan, Xu Jianhao, and others left in anger on the spot. The county magistrate believed that the representatives had no sincerity in mediation and suspected that they had incited a strike, so he ordered the representatives to be detained. As a result, the problem became even more serious, and all rice mills in the county went on strike. Subsequently, the Party Department temporarily released those who were detained on bail, but it is expected that the unrest will not subside for the time being.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Tea Leaf Business of Foreign Firms: Suspension of Draft Acceptance Commences Today; Trade Association Issues a Heartfelt Declaration Explaining the Situation; Yu Qiaqing Cables the Chairman of Anhui Province to Intercede <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Following the decision by the Foreign Tea Firms Association of Shanghai to suspend draft acceptance from April 21st due to the Anhui Province's control over the transportation and sale of Qimen tea, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce persuaded them to postpone the measure by two days. Simultaneously, urgent telegrams were sent to Anhui Province, requesting the swift adoption of the tea industry's suggestions, and a report was submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government for relaying an urgent appeal to Anhui Province for relief. Yesterday, after receiving a reply from Anhui Province, an emergency general meeting was held at 2 PM, resolving to issue a declaration and implement the suspension of draft acceptance to awaken the authorities. Starting today, all tea firms in the city, including Zhongxin Chang, Hongyuan Yong, Yongxing Long, Zhenhe, Yitai, Yuanfeng Run, Gong Sheng Yong, Shenyuan, Rende Yong, Shengchang Sheng, Yilong, Xietai, Tongtai, Xielong, and others, will suspend draft acceptance and close their businesses. The association's declaration and the exchange of correspondence between Yu Qiaqing and others advocating for the industry are recorded below in their original form:</p>
<p>Association Declaration: A Heartfelt and Urgent Declaration from the Entire Tea Firms of the Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association Regarding the Suspension of Draft Acceptance. To Whom It May Concern: Foreign tea leaf business is a major export trade. Since the opening of trade, our industry colleagues have been managing it diligently for over seventy years without interruption. In February of this year, the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Council convened a tea technology discussion conference. The Anhui Provincial Department of Construction suddenly proposed a plan for the transportation and sale of Qihong tea. The result was only a general approval, with the stipulation that the unemployment and debts of export tea merchants, i.e., tea firms, must be taken into consideration. This confirmed that our industry colleagues' business should be maintained. However, to ensure certainty for the future and to avoid unexpected issues, our association again requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward a telegram to the Anhui Provincial Government to inquire about the situation. Subsequently, we received a reply telegram from Anhui, stating that it would not hinder the tea firms from extending loans, and asking us to convey that there was no need for excessive concern. Upon hearing that, the tea firms actively raised funds and advanced loans into the mountains, amounting to over one million yuan. Unexpectedly, on April 1st, the Anhui Provincial Government, together with representatives from the Jiangxi Provincial Government, established the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee in Anqing, agreeing on a plan to control the transportation and sale of black tea from both provinces, ostensibly to provide relief but in reality aiming for provincial management. After reading the newspaper reports, our association immediately, based on the aforementioned approvals and stating that the tea firms had already lent a large sum of money, thus being closely linked to the tea merchants, and that their own interests were tied to the transportation and sale of tea leaves, so that the debt could be guaranteed, it was imperative that the tea leaves be returned to the firms for sale. If the provincial government, on the one hand, clearly permitted the tea firms to extend loans, and on the other hand, controlled the transportation and sale, it would violate the premise of not hindering tea firms from extending loans and the original intention of building credibility and showing compassion for the merchants' difficulties. Therefore, we submitted a formal request to exempt us from the plan, so as to demonstrate credibility. However, we did not receive a reply. Subsequently, we dispatched representatives, Sun Zifu, Zhuo Jingcheng, and Zhuo Huapu, to Anhui to petition, and personally presented the position of the tea firms, the circumstances of the loans, and all our opinions to the heads of the Finance and Construction Departments. Considering both the government's credibility and the merchants' business, we tentatively drafted a compromise plan, presented the draft clauses with sincerity for negotiation. Secretary Chen of the Construction Department and Section Chief Lu of the Finance Department conveyed that the clauses were fully accepted. If we could obtain the agreement of our colleagues upon returning to Shanghai and submit a formal report, approval would be telegraphed immediately and the government would not extend loans separately, nor would it compete with the people for profit. Subsequently, on the 9th, our association listened to the representatives' report and immediately submitted a formal report by mail. To date, ten days have passed without a reply, yet the provincial government is sending personnel to handle the registration of tea merchants and randomly extending loans. This is a general outline of the development of the industry. In summary, the policies implemented by the provincial government cannot be explained by reason or confirmed by official correspondence. For example, they said that it would not hinder tea firms from extending loans, but now they are extending loans themselves to merchants who have already received loans, which is obviously a hindrance. They said that there was no need for excessive concern, yet the written request was not approved, the representatives were in the province, a plan was drafted and approved in person, and the association's formal report was not approved, which obviously caused people to be very concerned. They said that they were not competing with the people for profit, yet the loan procedures mostly followed the old rules of the tea firms, and the examination of guarantees was even stricter, which was obviously competing for profit. Our colleagues originally had reason to speak of and provincial telegrams to rely on, especially since the tea season has arrived, appeals have been exhausted, and we cannot force the provincial government to show special consideration and give an immediate response. Suspecting the provincial government's intention and the ruthlessness of its methods, all tea firms are in a state of fear. Today they control black tea, tomorrow they will control green tea, and we will all perish together. We have no choice but to consider our lives and property and urgently seek self-preservation measures. We have made clear our situation to the central authorities and decided unanimously to suspend draft acceptance and cease business from April 21st until a proper solution is obtained. Subsequently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu Qiaqing strongly urged us to postpone the implementation by two days. At the same time, urgent telegrams were sent to Anhui Province, requesting the adoption of the tea industry's request, and telegrams were sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government to relay the message to Anhui Province. However, as of 5 PM on the 22nd, we had not received a reply from the Anhui Provincial Government. Our association has cried out in vain, without being pitied. Forced by circumstances, we held an emergency meeting and resolved that, starting from April 23rd, under the condition of business suspension, all loan drafts for all export black and green tea in the city, regardless of whether they have been signed or not, will be suspended, to show our determination. We have also sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward to the banking and finance industries, stating that if this causes disputes, the authorities of Anhui Province must bear full responsibility. Tea firms extend loans mostly by borrowing at interest, stipulating that payment is due upon the sale of tea. Now that there is no tea to sell and the news has spread, who would be willing to lend to tea firms? The bitterness of this situation, where we are facing insurmountable difficulties, is also the result of the Anhui Provincial Government's actions. Alas, the long-standing history of tea firms for decades, and the free business protected by legal guarantees, is like crows wailing in mourning. Is it not fate? The matter is urgent and the change is extraordinary. We have described the whole situation and respectfully request all national industrial and commercial organizations to uphold justice. We will be eternally grateful. This declaration is made with due respect for your consideration.</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Reply: The Ministry of Industry telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Regarding the Anhui Province's plan to control the transportation and sale of Qimen tea, we have repeatedly consulted the Anhui Provincial Government regarding the telegrams. We will immediately telegraph them to expedite a solution and request them to reply with the control and sales plan for handling. Ministry of Industry, Yang.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Telegram: Yu Qiaqing telegraphed the Chairman of Anhui Province: Urgent, Anqing, Provincial Government, Chairman Liu Junjian. Your telegram is respectfully acknowledged. I immediately persuaded the gentlemen of the Foreign Tea Firms not to suspend draft acceptance or close business, which would cause a huge disturbance. However, all tea firms insisted that the document submitted on the first day was accepted by your government and that it was a final concession. If a decision already approved is reversed, it would not only fail to demonstrate credibility but would also force tea merchants to have no way out. In order to preserve the remaining capital, they are permitted to stop accepting drafts and cease business uniformly on the 23rd. All tea firms have signed. The annual value of foreign black and green boxed tea is 30 million yuan. You love the country and the merchants. I beseech you to follow the will of the people and immediately telegraph your approval of the document submitted on the first day. My ability has been exhausted. Awaiting a reply telegram. Yu Hede bows.</p>
<p>Song's Reply: Zhu Ziwent replied to Yu Qiaqing: Mr. Qiaqing, I have received your letter of April 9th and am fully aware of the situation. The Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Transportation and Sales Committee is organized by the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces. The Economic Committee has no records of it. Having received telegrams from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Foreign Tea Firms Association, requesting the cancellation of the committee, the committee has telegraphed the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi Provinces to consider the business of the tea firms to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. I am writing to inform you of this matter. Respectfully, Song Ziwent bows.</p>

<p>Since Jiangsu Bank switched to a system in the 24th year whereby transactions between branches were routed through the head office, the regulation of capital and management of business have proven very convenient. Currently, there is an urgent need to increase branches, open communication lines, and promote business development. In order to facilitate the planning and implementation of strategies, the supervision of personnel, and the planning and coordination of resources, considering the current transportation situation and commercial trends in Jiangsu Province, all counties in the province are divided into eight districts. One bank in each district is designated as the district management bank, responsible for the planning and guidance of all branches within that district. If it is necessary to establish branches in counties where no branches exist, the district management bank will prepare for and implement the establishment. The division of regions within Jiangsu Province, directly under the head office, consists of eight districts: The Shanghai District, with Shanghai as the district management bank, overseeing Doushan, Chuansha, Nanhui, Fengxian, Songjiang, Jinshan, Jiading, Taicang, Qingpu, Kunshan, Suzhou, Changshu, and Wujiang.

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai Shunxing Fishing Boat Company owns two fishing boats, Hali and Haiyong, which catch fish in the waters of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The company received a telegram yesterday from Wu Xinglin, captain of the Hali fishing boat, from Shengshan, stating that at 1:10 AM on April 17, while anchored for rest in the waters northeast of Haijiao, it was suddenly struck by the Japanese fishing boat Jiu Liu Bozhou Maru. The hull was pierced, and within five minutes, the boat sank, with only the mast light visible on the surface. All eleven crew members were rescued by the Japanese fishing boat Jiu Liu Bozhou Maru and sent back to the Haiyong boat. They lost all their clothing and belongings, and the situation was extremely miserable. The loss of the Hali, including the boat price and fishing equipment on board, is estimated to be 20,000 yuan. The company is arranging for the aftermath while awaiting the return of the captain and crew to Shanghai to hear the details of the disaster. Based on the certificate of collision issued by Okato Kanjuro, captain of the Japanese fishing boat Jiu Liu Bozhou Maru, they will negotiate for compensation.</p>

<p>Rear Admiral Leader, the newly appointed commander of the British Fleet in China, has been cruising around Southern China since taking office. It has been learned that Leader is scheduled to pass through Shanghai and travel to Nanjing on the 5th of next month aboard his flagship, HMS Kent, to pay a visit to our country's authorities.

<h3 id="e145">Promotion of National Products in the Northwest: Shanghai National Product Merchants Raise Several Points; Products Can Be Collected Once Agreement Is Reached <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia Province, came to Shanghai a month ago and contacted local national product manufacturers, requesting them to organize a product exhibition delegation to display their goods in the province during the annual trade fair in order to promote national products in the northwestern border province. Chairman Ma has now returned to the province. The matters concerning the exhibition are being discussed between Zhou Fanwen, owner of the Hezong Trading Company, which manages import and export trade in the province, and the China National Product Promotion Association. According to Wang Weiyao, director of the association, in recent years, authorities in various provinces have paid close attention to and promoted national products. Manufacturers strongly support Chairman Ma's proposal. However, the province is located in the northwest, and transportation is very inconvenient. After large quantities of goods are transported from Shanghai to Xi'an or Baotou, they may be rented cars through Guyuan to reach the destination. The road has only been built the base, and the road surface has not yet been paved. Therefore, there are few merchants traveling back and forth, and adequate protection is required to ensure safety. If camels and horses are hired from Baotou to follow the old commercial roads, it will take a long time, and the transportation costs will be very high. If the products cannot be sold out during the period, they will have to be transported back to Shanghai, which is very uneconomical. Therefore, according to the manufacturers' opinion, if all the products cannot be sold, the provincial government or local merchants must purchase them to avoid losses. The provincial government must provide effective protection for the transportation of goods to ensure safety and exemption from all taxes. Furthermore, the exchange rate between the two places should also be stipulated, as there is no usual exchange relationship between the province and Shanghai, and the provincial government must arrange for exchange from within the government expenses. The above points have been communicated in writing for consultation. If a satisfactory result is achieved, products can be collected in order to rush to the exhibition before the annual trade fair before the old lunar May.</p>

Of the tens of thousands of performers in this city, about three thousand will be mobilized today.

Such as performance venues, theater broadcast platforms, singing and dancing troupes, and various Tanghui gatherings, are all publicity areas for these people.</p>
<p>Actively Preparing the Lantern Parade: The preparatory committee believes that many people will participate in the lantern parade, and the general public also pays great attention to it. It is indeed the best publicity method. Therefore, in addition to the participating institutions and groups providing their own lamps, a large number of five-color lanterns with pictures and slogans are being made, which are very eye-catching. Other items such as flags are currently being rushed to manufacture.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is Film Publicity Day</p>
<p>Cinemas Add Films: Tomorrow is the fifth day of Publicity Week and belongs to Film Publicity Day. The preparatory committee has specially pre-made a large number of anti-smoking and anti-drug slides and distributed them to major cinemas in the city, such as Jincheng, Mingxing, Zhongyang, Kade, Guanghua, and Gonghe. After the opening advertisement news of each showing and before the feature film is shown, these slides will be added to make the audience aware of the terrible nature of smoking. It is now heard that the authorities of each cinema feel that it is necessary to vigorously promote the prohibition of smoking and drugs, so this film has been added to the screenings since the beginning of Publicity Week.</p>

A discussion meeting was specially convened at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the various procedures for command and discipline. More than ten chief and deputy commanders and chief and deputy disciplinarians from the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Farmers' Association, and the Boy Scout Council, etc., discussed matters related to command and discipline during the lantern parade.</p>
<p>Du Discusses Punishment and Reformation: The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters held a broadcast publicity campaign to ban smoking and drugs. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Du Yuesheng was specially invited to give a speech on "The Punishment and Reformation of Smoking Prohibition" at the Guohua Radio Station. The time was from 3:15 to 4:00 p.m. Mr. Du has always studied the smoking ban policy, so his speech was very thorough. The reporter of the Shen Shi News Agency found and recorded his speech as follows: People from all walks of life, ladies and gentlemen, today, I am honored to be invited by the members of the Municipal Party Headquarters to say a few words for the broadcast promotion of banning marriage and rejecting drugs, so that I can have the opportunity to talk with people from all walks of life. I feel very honored. However, I have little research on this issue and I am not good at words, so I dare not say it is a speech, but just talk to you about my personal feelings. Speaking of the issue of smoking prohibition, there is a long history in our country. The predecessors have made many theories and methods for this problem. In the middle of November last year, I was also invited by the Municipal Bureau of Education to speak at the Zhongxi Radio Station. Once gave a brief report on the situation of the Shanghai Smoking Prohibition Committee. What I want to talk to you today is about the punishment and reformation of smoking prohibition. It is really just a commonplace. Our country's society has always been maintained on morality, and the people's concept of the legal system is very weak. Therefore, it seems not easy to achieve full effect by starting from the strictness of punishment in smoking prohibition. It must be assisted by reformation to complete this work, which is also the purpose of this Publicity Smoking Prohibition. The power of reformation is active and universal, but without the high-hanging punishment in front, the power of reformation may have a day of exhaustion, and there is no way to save it. The government certainly does not want the people to break the law and be punished. It is best to get a rational self-awareness, or be awakened by reformation and automatically eliminate this bad habit. However, the people's attention to the concept of the legal system is an indispensable condition in the voice of smoking prohibition. Now I will talk about the temporary regulations on punishing smoking and the regulations on strictly enforcing smoking cessation and eliminating smokers, and select the important ones. In addition, there are various regulations and regulations. If you propose to talk about it, you can't finish it in a short time. In the future, the Municipal Smoking Prohibition Committee plans to summarize various laws and regulations on smoking prohibition and print them into a separate booklet for people from all walks of life to study. Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Smoking states that those who intend to manufacture opium and plant poppy shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years. Article 4 states that those who gather crowds to resist the eradication of tobacco seedlings shall be punished as follows: The principal or on-site commander shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment; the rest of the crowd shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years but less than ten years. Those who privately sell and transport opium shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for more than three years (and may be fined up to 3,000 yuan). If the quantity is more than 500 taels, they shall be sentenced to death. Those who sell and transport poppy seeds shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year but less than seven years and may be fined up to 1,000 yuan. Those who import from foreign countries shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years and may be fined up to 5,000 yuan. The same applies to those who export to foreign countries. Those who open houses for people to smoke opium shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or imprisonment for more than five years and may be fined up to 3,000 yuan. Those who use smoking cessation permits to provide people with smoking for profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years but less than seven years and may be fined up to 1,000 yuan. Those who smoke opium shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than six months but less than two years and may be fined up to 300 yuan. Those who are addicted shall also be ordered to see a doctor within a time limit and be ordered to quit. Those who smoke again after quitting shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year but less than three years and may be fined up to 500 yuan and ordered to quit. Those who commit three offenses shall be sentenced to death. All school teachers and students who commit the above three crimes of opening houses, using permits to provide people with smoking for profit, or smoking opium shall be punished with the heaviest sentence in the original articles. Article of the Provisional Regulations on Drug Prohibition states that the drugs referred to in this regulation refer to morphine, cocaine, and other compounds or various colored pills, caffeine, milk powder, quinacrine, etc., which are compounded or found to be used for manufacturing drugs, shall be treated as drugs. Article 3 stipulates that those who manufacture or transport drugs shall be sentenced to death. Article 4 stipulates that those who sell or possess drugs with the intention of selling them shall be sentenced to death. Article 5 stipulates that those who intend to make a profit by administering morphine to others, or use a house for people to use drugs, shall be sentenced to death. Article 6 stipulates that those who administer morphine or use drugs within the year of the Republic of China shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than one year but less than three years, and shall be ordered to see a doctor within a time limit and be ordered to quit. Those who re-offend after quitting shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years but less than seven years, and shall be ordered to quit within a time limit, and those who re-offend after re-quitting shall be sentenced to death. Article 7 stipulates that those who commit the crimes in the previous article within the year of the Republic of China shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than three years but less than seven years, and shall be ordered to see a doctor within a time limit and be ordered to quit. Those who re-offend shall be sentenced to imprisonment for more than seven years and shall be ordered to quit. Those who re-offend after re-quitting shall be sentenced to death. Article 8 stipulates that those who commit the crimes in Articles 3 to 7 of this regulation from the 26th year of the Republic of China shall be sentenced to death. This kind of severe punishment, smoking compatriots, can really realize and wake up. Fortunately, during the period of self-renewal registration, go to register as soon as possible, and start to quit, not only for your own recovery, but also to increase efficiency for the country's revitalization of the nation. Today, leader Chiang Chairman is doing his best to rescue compatriots who have fallen into the sea of ​​suffering. I hope that smoking compatriots will not abandon themselves to the country and not be reformed. This is what I pray for very much.</p>

<h3 id="e153">The Association of Northeastern University Students in Shanghai Requests an Increase in the Number of National Representatives <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The Draft Constitution Review Committee has stipulated that the total number of national representatives nationwide is 1,200, and the number distributed to the five northeastern provinces and cities is limited to only 23, which seems to be disproportionate compared with other provinces. Zhang Xueliang, commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, previously telegraphed Beijing to request on behalf of the association. It is now heard that the Association of Northeastern University Students in Shanghai also sent a fast telegraph to Beijing, requesting the Central Party Headquarters and the Draft Constitution Review Committee to increase the number of representatives to show fairness. The original telegram is as follows: To the Central Party Headquarters and the Draft Constitution Review Committee in Nanjing: The number of national representatives for the five northeastern provinces and cities totals only 23, which seems to be disproportionate compared with other provinces. It is understood that the standard for allocating the number of representatives is based on the size of the population, and the total population of the five northeastern provinces and cities is indeed more than 34 million, which does not seem to warrant such a small number. Moreover, for the northeastern puppet organization, our entire country insists on a non-recognition attitude. Then, the number of northeastern representatives, like other provinces, is proportional to the population, and there is no need to make a fuss. It is enough to show the world that we have always recognized the Northeast as a part of our territory, which is no different from other provinces. On the one hand, it is enough to slightly prevent someone from demanding recognition of the puppet organization, and at the same time, it is also to strengthen the inward feelings of the northeastern people. As for the land being occupied and the election being difficult, there is no remedy for referring to the examples of Mongolia, Tibet, and overseas Chinese. It does not seem to be a reason to reduce the number of representatives. It is inappropriate to set the number of northeastern representatives to 23, which is contrary to legal and human feelings. We dare to appeal to increase the number of northeastern representatives in proportion to other provinces, in order to comfort public opinion and show fairness. In the face of the telegram, we are overwhelmed with anticipation. The Northeastern University Students in Shanghai: Cui Jiuqing, Pu Yutian, Ding Fenghui, Jia Enchao, Lu Zhenzhong, Jin Qingsan, Wang Xuehai, Tian Yulin, Ma Jiming, Zhang Guoren, Ye Guanghui, Yang Zhixin, Ma Suxin, Li Changjian, Li Qingfang, Wu Ronghe, Zhao Enlun, Wang Yawen, Guo Yulin, Zhang Wanlin, Liu Hongdian, Li Zhihou, Ma Junde, Ma Baolong, Guo Xiaofen, Xiao Dinghua, Sun Jijie, Tie Guangtao, Cao Shujun, and others kowtow.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week: Cai Jingjun's Broadcast Speech, Xia Zhongming Represents the Broadcast <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report: Yesterday was the broadcast propaganda day for Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week. From 4:00 PM to 4:30 PM, Cai Jingjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, specially sent Xia Zhongming, Director of the Audit Section of the Fourth Division, to represent him at the Zhongxi Radio Station to broadcast a very detailed explanation of the significance of anti-smoking. The original script of the broadcast is recorded below.</p>
<p>Fellow citizens of this city, from the 20th to the 26th of this month is the expanded Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week. Why is this expanded Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Propaganda Week designated? It is to expand the propaganda about the scourge of opium and drugs, so that all residents of the city understand the threat of opium and drugs to the survival of the nation and the people, arouse the attention of citizens, and awaken opium addicts, work together to eliminate opium and drugs, and consolidate the survival of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>Its significance is very important. China has suffered from the scourge of opium and drugs for hundreds of years, and in the past hundred years, the harm has been even deeper, almost jeopardizing the survival of the entire country and nation. All people with knowledge and insight are heartbroken. Speaking of the history of opium prohibition in China, it can be said to be three hundred years old. Since the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty and up to the establishment of the Republic of China, and the period when the Northern Warlords were in power, opium prohibition orders have been promulgated. Among them, the methods adopted by Lin Zexu in Guangdong during the Daoguang period were the most severe, which led to the Opium War and the signing of unequal treaties, which had the greatest impact on our national status. Therefore, examining the results of our country's past opium prohibition efforts, they have all failed. What is the reason for the failure? Because the people who advocated opium prohibition in the past only knew that opium should be prohibited, but did not know how to seek methods to prohibit it. Because the methods of prohibition were not proper, there was no effect, and the result was failure. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in view of the disaster of opium, which is more severe than before, and that if it is not prohibited as soon as possible, the country and the nation will be plunged into a position of no return, so he stipulated a</p>
<p>Six-Year Opium Prohibition plan, and detailed the prohibition plan, adopting appropriate methods to make it easy to implement and achieve the effect of completion within a limited time. The current method of opium prohibition considers all four aspects of planting, transportation, smoking, and selling. Because if only smoking is prohibited but planting, transportation, and selling are not prohibited, then the planters will plant, the transporters will transport, and the sellers will sell, and the effectiveness of smoking prohibition will be offset. The reverse is also true. Therefore, planting, transportation, selling, and smoking should all be carried out simultaneously, with smoking prohibition as the center. The first step in opium prohibition is to register opium addicts, so that all people who smoke opium are registered. Then, we can know how many opium addicts there are in each province and city, and how much they smoke. We can get statistics, know the total number of opium addicts, and use it as a standard for phased rehabilitation. Knowing the total amount of smoking can be used as a method for controlling planting, transportation, and selling. Therefore, with a standard for phased rehabilitation of opium addicts, there is also a method for phased reduction of planting, transportation, and selling. When opium addicts are completely rehabilitated, then planting, transportation, and selling can be completely prohibited. Therefore, opium prohibition must involve planting, transportation, selling, and smoking</p>
<p>simultaneously in order to achieve results. As mentioned above, smoking is the center of opium prohibition, and the first step in smoking prohibition is the registration of opium addicts. The registration method is now being actively promoted throughout the country. This city started registration in July last year and ended at the end of December. The number of registered opium addicts is 30,833. However, according to the investigation and the estimates of special industry associations, the number of unregistered opium addicts is large. Because unregistered opium addicts are worried about being detained and sentenced when they cannot obtain a license after the registration deadline, although this is due to the fact that opium addicts do not understand the significance of registration, it also affects the future of opium prohibition, because if opium addicts do not fully register according to law, the total number of opium addicts and the total amount of smoking cannot be accurately counted, then the control of planting, transportation, and selling cannot be carried out. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is also the Opium Prohibition Commissioner, because the registration of opium addicts in various provinces and cities has not been widespread, has recently ordered the provinces and cities to implement a general inspection of opium addicts, and has specially appointed commissioners to handle it jointly with the provinces and cities, and has also promulgated a kind of reporting opium addicts,</p>
<p>Registration Methods. The content of the registration methods for reporting opium addicts includes sending police officers to inspect households to check for opium addicts. If there are unregistered opium addicts, they will be ordered to register. At the same time, unregistered opium addicts are allowed to register retroactively and will not be prosecuted for the time being. This method can be said to be a compassionate measure taken by the government to show consideration for opium addicts and give them a chance to start anew, thinking about the interests of opium addicts. Being able to get this opportunity to register retroactively and avoid the law is a very rare opportunity. If you miss this opportunity to register retroactively, it will be more difficult to find another opportunity to register than to reach the sky. Therefore, it is hoped that unregistered opium addicts will quickly apply to the Public Security Bureau and branch offices to register during the period when reporting opium addicts is allowed to register retroactively. If you continue to delay and fail to register according to the regulations, after the three-month deadline expires, smoking opium without a license will be treated as illegal private smoking. If illegal private smokers are found by the inspectors of this bureau, they will be arrested and sent to the headquarters for trial according to the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Prohibition Offenses, without leniency. Opium addicts, pay attention, this is the</p>
<p>Last Time for registration, hurry up to register retroactively, don't make a mistake and regret it later. The registered opium addicts and the amount of smoking should be rehabilitated in phases and reduced in phases according to regulations, with six months as one phase, that is, a portion of the registered opium addicts should be rehabilitated in the first six months, and those who cannot be rehabilitated in the first six months should also appropriately reduce the amount of smoking, so those who cannot be rehabilitated should exchange for an opium cessation license and temporarily smoke, and then gradually reduce the amount of opium until rehabilitation. Therefore, in the strict implementation of the opium cessation regulations, there is a provision for a limited-term opium cessation license, which must be exchanged every month. This city started registration in July 24 and ended at the end of December. The six-month validity period of all opium cessation licenses issued has expired. According to regulations, new licenses must be exchanged. Therefore, from April 1st to May 31st, it is the period for opium addicts in this city to exchange for the second phase of licenses. If it passes</p>
<p>May 31st and you have not come to register to exchange for a new license, then the old license you previously obtained will be invalidated. Smoking opium in the future will be considered illegal private smoking. Opium addicts who smoke illegally and privately will be arrested if found by the investigators of this bureau and sent to the headquarters for trial according to law. The penalty and punishment will be in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Prohibition Offenses, which stipulates imprisonment for not less than six months and not more than two years, and may be subject to a fine of not more than 300 yuan. It is hoped that opium addicts who have obtained the first phase of licenses will comply with the prescribed time limit and quickly go to the bureau to apply for license exchange registration. As for the procedures for license exchange, they have already been announced in the newspapers.</p>
<p>The main purpose of handling opium addict registration and issuing limited-term opium cessation licenses is to obtain the total number of opium addicts as a standard for phased rehabilitation. The purpose is still</p>
<p>Phased Opium Cessation to achieve the purpose of prohibition. However, opium addicts who are old and deeply addicted and cannot be rehabilitated immediately will be issued licenses to smoke temporarily, so that their amount of smoking will gradually decrease until they are rehabilitated. Therefore, the method of rehabilitation is relatively gentle and the time is longer. This is a kind of painstaking effort of the government to show understanding for those who are old and whose addiction cannot be rehabilitated immediately. It does not mean that once you obtain a license, you can smoke opium permanently without having to rehabilitate. If opium addicts have this kind of idea, then they have completely misunderstood the government's painstaking efforts and intentions. Therefore, if opium addicts can understand the government's determination to prohibit opium and voluntarily go to the Public Security Bureau to request to be sent to rehabilitation, not only will we praise them, but we will also welcome them extremely. This city has three municipal opium cessation hospitals and one temporary drug rehabilitation center. The facilities are very complete and the technology is very proficient, and</p>
<p>All Expenses are borne by the municipal government, and opium addicts do not need to pay fees. Therefore, opium addicts who are willing to rehabilitate immediately can voluntarily request to be sent to rehabilitation. This is the best opportunity for opium addicts to quit opium. If opium addicts voluntarily pay for opium cessation, the Health Bureau and the Public Security Bureau will designate 17 hospitals with complete equipment and excellent technology, where they can also be admitted to the hospital for opium cessation. After obtaining a certificate of rehabilitation, they can submit it to the Public Security Bureau for record, and it can be considered that they have successfully quit opium addiction. Therefore, opium addicts who can recognize the government's opium prohibition policy and determination and can quit opium immediately are truly praised by the government.</p>
<p>After I have explained the government's opium prohibition policy and opium prohibition methods, I hope that opium addicts who smoke opium will have a thorough understanding, and citizens will have a thorough understanding,</p>
<p>Understanding Recognition. We must make the Chinese nation survive permanently in the world, and the Republic of China stand permanently among nations. We must make a fierce attack on the opium and drugs that endanger our permanent survival and completely eliminate them. We also hope that opium addicts will abide by the laws and regulations set by the government and strive to rehabilitate themselves as soon as possible, have a complete personality, and still be a good citizen of the country. This is my fervent hope. Citizens, let us unite and work hard to promote the anti-smoking and anti-drug movement. Citizens, abide by the government's laws and regulations, eliminate lifelong pain, and regain future happiness.</p>

<p>The British-owned York Refrigeration Plant at No. 29 Quanji'an Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Zhabei, has a factory next to it at No. 13 Lane. When machine parts are damaged, they are repaired by hired craftsmen using electric ironing methods at any time. Yesterday at 3:30 PM, a craftsman from the factory, Zhu Tingbao, 26 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 255 Qipu Road, was using a current device to repair a refrigeration iron machine part. Suddenly, the refrigeration cylinder burst with a loud explosion like thunder. Iron fragments flew everywhere. Zhu was working with his head lowered and was knocked to the ground by the explosion. Both arms and legs were severed from his torso, and blood and flesh splattered, a truly tragic sight. He died on the spot. Those who were injured in the head, face, hands, feet, chest, abdomen, etc., included Yan Qianlang, Yang Xiaodi, Wang Asan, Lin Quansheng, and Zhao Mugen, a total of five people. They were bleeding profusely and moaning in pain. The police officer on duty found out and reported to the Linping Road Police Station. An ambulance was called to send the five injured people to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Their injuries were not serious. The police station sent police officers to investigate the scene and ordered the local bailiff to report to the local court, which dispatched a prosecutor to the scene today to examine the body of Zhu Tingbao, who was killed in the explosion. At the same time, the factory will provide generous compensation to the family of the deceased.</p>

<p>Yu Shunxing Foundry at No. 19 Changnan Road, East City, Wusong, specializes in casting copper sheaves for sailboat rigging. Yesterday, the owner of the shop went to Shanghai to sell goods. Only two apprentices were left in the shop. At around 3 PM, an old goods vendor brought a copper box shaped like a cigarette can for sale. Lu Xiucheng, a 15-year-old apprentice from Taizhou, gave him four small dollars and accepted it, but he did not know that the box was a bomb. Lu was dismantling the box at the door when the bomb suddenly exploded with a loud bang and sparks flying everywhere. The apprentice was the first to be hit, and a hole the size of a silver dollar was blown into his abdomen. An old woman named Pan Liu, 59 years old, who was setting up a fruit stall next door, was injured in the hand. Li Zhanglin, a clerk at Yuanshun Pig Bank, which was three or four doors away to the south, was injured in the leg. Xu Xinshun, a tax reporting agent, and Xu Baotang were injured in the leg. The farmer Yang Fulang was injured in the leg. After the incident, the five injured men and women were sent to the sanitation hospital. After the doctor bandaged them, they were discharged from the hospital because their injuries were minor. It is said that the explosive power of the bomb was not very strong, otherwise it might have caused a major disaster.</p>

<p>According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Wai Lun News Agency, a reporter from the Continental Daily obtained information yesterday afternoon from reliable sources that, since the arrest of three suspects in the case of the shooting death of Japanese sailor Nakayama Hideo, and after secret interrogation by the First Special Court, more suspects would be arrested. Yesterday, this newspaper published a news item stating that two suspects, said to be directly related to the Nakayama shooting, had been arrested by the police and sent to the Special District Court for secret trial. One of them was reportedly arrested in Tianjin and sent to Shanghai. The news in yesterday's newspaper also indicated that the police officers handling the case were keeping all details strictly confidential. It is now heard that a third person was arrested in Qingdao a few days ago and sent to Shanghai on Sunday. He was interrogated in court yesterday morning. Therefore, the secrecy of this case seems to have increased another layer. This third person and the two suspects arrested a few days ago were tried in the First Special Court at around 11 o'clock yesterday, presided over by Judge Feng Shide. No one was allowed to attend the hearing. Apart from the presiding judge, clerk, police officer, bailiff's lawyer, and the suspects, there were no other people. Zhang Tingrong, secretary of the municipal government, was present as an observer but refused to release any information about the case. The police authorities are keeping the case extremely secret. To avoid leaks, only a few police officers directly involved in the case know the progress of the case, but they are also keeping it strictly confidential. As for other police officers, most of them have no knowledge of the contents of the case. After the above three suspects were interrogated yesterday, they were escorted back to the Central Jail under strict guard in a car. When the suspects left the court, the crowds of onlookers were dispersed, and efforts were made to prevent reporters from seeing the faces of the suspects. Because it is only known that the above-mentioned arrested people are related to the Nakayama shooting case, and no other direct information has been leaked to the outside world, it has aroused a kind of speculation that the three arrested people are not Chinese. The reporter of the Continental Daily had a glimpse of the arrested suspects when they stepped out of the court after the trial on Monday and yesterday. In this glimpse, the reporter had an idea that there might be jurisdictional issues mixed in this case, so the trial was so secret. But this is just speculation and cannot be taken as fact. The Public Concession Engineering Bureau established a special investigation department in November last year after the case occurred to investigate the case, but the staff of the department refused to discuss the case with reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>According to our newspaper, at around 10 PM last night, the Japanese Police Department specially dispatched two Japanese police officers to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request assistance in arresting two Chinese women. At that time, Inspector Chang Zhu Dasui of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Captain Zhang Datong of the Detective Squad, and Director Liang Fuchu of the North Railway Station Branch jointly went to the Yuegong Dance Hall below the Yuegong Hotel on North Sichuan Road to arrest Ye Lin (also known as Ye Eying), a female shareholder of the hall from Guangdong, and Chen Guizhen, a dancer who had just come to Shanghai from Qingdao. They were taken back to the headquarters and temporarily placed under guard. As for what kind of suspicion the two women were guilty of, it was impossible to find out because all parties were keeping it strictly confidential. However, after the two women were arrested, the Japanese Consulate repeatedly requested extradition from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, but all were rejected. Therefore, the two Chinese women are still in the VIP room of the headquarters. Director Cai also returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning, and has also asked the municipal government for instructions regarding the request made by the Japanese Consulate.</p>
<p>According to the Greater Shanghai Evening Post, there are now six suspects detained and awaiting trial in the case of the Japanese sailor Nakayama who was killed on Binle Road in November last year. Three of them are Chinese, currently believed to be Cantonese, and are detained by the General Patrol Room of the Public Concession. Two other Chinese are detained by the Nanshi Public Security Bureau. There is also a Korean detained by the Police Department of the Japanese Consulate. The patrol room still does not want to release any information about the case, and the Chinese and Japanese authorities are also keeping their mouths shut. The reason is that the Chinese, Japanese, and Public Concession Police authorities are still cooperating to apprehend other suspects, and the true culprit in the case is also on the list of those being apprehended. According to reliable sources this morning, one of the three Cantonese was arrested in Tianjin last week and sent to Shanghai, one was arrested in Qingdao at the same time and also sent to Shanghai, and the third was arrested by the Dixiwei Road Patrol Room a few days ago. The first two were questioned by the First Special District Court on Sunday, and it was decided that the three would be interrogated together again. It is said that the hearing will continue on May 1. The Korean detained by the Japanese Consulate, nicknamed Jia Ke, is said to have come to China from Vladivostok and was arrested in Qingdao by the Public Concession detectives on April 15 along with the first two Cantonese. He was sent to Shanghai on Sunday and handed over to the Japanese Consulate for detention. It is said that all of them are accomplices, while the true culprit has not yet been arrested and is believed to be hiding in Qingdao. Yesterday, two women related to the case were arrested at the Yuegong Dance Hall on North Sichuan Road. One is a dancer named Chen, from Ningbo, 28 years old, who recently came to Shanghai from Qingdao. The other is a married Cantonese woman named Ye, 45 years old, who is involved in the operation of the Yuegong Dance Hall and Hotel. At around 5 PM yesterday afternoon, two Japanese officers went to the Nanshi Public Security Bureau to visit the director. Because the director had gone to Nanjing on official business, they were received by the secretary. The Japanese officers requested assistance in arresting the above-mentioned two women, but did not specify their names or addresses. So, the police chief and the detective chief led a team with the Japanese officers to the North Railway Station Branch and asked the director to go with them to arrest the suspects. They first went to a middle school in Zhabei but did not see anyone. Then, they traced their steps to the Yuegong Dance Hall and finally arrested the two women. The Japanese officers wanted to take the two women to the Japanese Consulate, but the Public Security Bureau officials refused. Later, at around 10 PM, the two women were taken to the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, and the Japanese officers still followed. They insisted on taking the two women to the Japanese Consulate, and finally left the bureau around midnight. The crimes committed by the two women are unknown, but it is known that their nature is very serious. It is believed that the two women hid the criminals in the case, hence their implication.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Bandits Indulge in Pleasure <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Their location was discovered by the Patrol Room. Two bandits were arrested in a brothel. The home of Mrs. Yang Lu, a local woman at No. 6 Dongbai Lao Road, was invaded by several bandits at 7:30 AM on the 18th of this month. They used guns to threaten her into silence and robbed her of gold jewelry and leather clothes worth 465 yuan, including 250 yuan in legal tender, and fled with a whistle. The Huishan Patrol Room was notified and sent Chinese Detective Zhou Guisheng and Detective Huang Fugen to investigate. It was discovered that the bandit gang, Zhang Heshang and Hua Agen, from Changzhou, were enjoying themselves in a brothel at No. 5 Yinyu Lane, Mintini Yin Road, in the French Concession, living outside the law. They secretly went there at 6 PM the day before yesterday and, together with detectives from the French Patrol Room, quietly entered the premises and arrested the two bandits, Zhang and Hua, and took them back to the Patrol Room for detention. Three stolen items, including a leather robe, were recovered. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, described the case and requested an extension. Then, Detective Zhou and Detective Huang gave a detailed account of the investigation and presented the clothes for inspection. According to Mrs. Yang Lu, the two defendants were present at the scene and robbed her with guns. When asked, Zhang and Hua admitted that the idea was initiated by a small tailor who was still at large. Judge Xiao Xiebin ordered them to be remanded in custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<p>The Nanjing New Life Movement Association recently read a news item in a Shanghai Western newspaper about someone impersonating the name of the association to solicit donations in Shanghai. According to a report from the inspection team in Shanghai, a person named Li Changchun, who had a business card with the title of Interview Director of the New Life Movement Association, was swindling in Shanghai. Upon receiving the report, the association believed that Li was not only damaging the reputation of the New Life Movement but also affecting international hearing. It has sent a letter to the military and police agencies in this city to investigate and arrest him, and will also notify all sectors of society to avoid being fooled.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Bizarre Dice Gambling Dispute; Same Numbers on Both Sides, All Throws Are the Same; Friends Quarrel Over Gambling, Request Court Investigation <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Yun'an, owner of the Shaoxing Xiang Board Box Shop at No. 46 Jiya Lane, Shandong Road, Wang Jinkun, owner of the Wang Shunxing Board Box Shop at No. 53 Jinlong Street, and Chen Baosheng (also known as Bao Sheng), owner of the Xianyilou Lamb Shop at No. 504 Fujian Road, were very good friends. In the first month of the lunar calendar this year, Chen opened a room at the Shanxi Road Nanjing Hotel for gambling Pai Gow. By March 18 of the solar calendar, Zhu owed 745 yuan, of which 700 yuan was in cash and 45 yuan in checks. Wang Jinkun owed 1,900 yuan in cash and 350 yuan in checks. At around 7 PM on the 18th of last month, they gathered again at the 703 room of the Nanjing Hotel to gamble Pai Gow, with Chen Baosheng as the dealer. A total of six Pai were pushed, and the dice thrown were all numbers such as three, seven, and eleven, without numbers such as two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, five, and nine. Zhu and Wang became suspicious and took the dice off to investigate. Chen then forcibly snatched them, resulting in a dispute. In the end, Zhu and others took the dice and, upon inspection, found that the dice were different from ordinary ones. The numbers on both sides were the same, and any throw would result in numbers such as three, seven, and eleven. They were about to negotiate when Chen suddenly reported to the Patrol Room that Tang and Fang were extorting 30 yuan from him and wanted to detain these two people. To investigate, they had to question Zhu Yun'an and Wang Jinkun. The detectives then arrested Zhu and Wang and sent them to the First Special Court. After questioning, the Patrol Room did not prosecute Zhu and Wang and released them. At that time, the Patrol Room suspected Chen of fraud and reported to the court to take them back for investigation, but the result was also not to prosecute. Zhu and Wang, feeling very unhappy about being deceived, hired lawyer Tao Wuzhi to file a criminal lawsuit against Chen Baosheng for fraud in the First Special Court, requesting that he be punished for the crime under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, and filed a civil lawsuit demanding the return of the money owed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Qianchang opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. The defendant hired lawyer Wang Shizong to defend him. According to his statement, there were only mahjong games at the time, not Pai Gow. Because the plaintiff had cheated, he argued with them, which led to today's incident. Judge Yang said that further investigation was needed and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Zhang Xiaogen Secretly Possessed a Handgun and Bullets; The Bullets Were Identical to Those Used in the Assassination Case; The First Special Court Sentenced Him to Two Years for Possessing Gun and Bullets; The Assassination Case Was Approved for Transfer to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for Investigation <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Ruan Yao, a Chinese detective of the Xinzha Police Station, arrested Zhang Xiaogen, a native of Changzhou, on the 16th of this month on Avenue Edward VII in Xinle Lane for secretly possessing firearms. A handgun and twenty bullets were confiscated and sent to the First Special Court, where he was prosecuted for the crime of possessing firearms. After an initial interrogation, he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation. It has now been learned that during the adjournment, the police station sent the confiscated gun and bullets to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Firearms Inspection Office for examination. It was discovered that the bullets were identical to those found on the body of Lu Rukang, who was shot and killed in an assassination on January 14th at No. 5 Renxing Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei. It was therefore determined that Lu Rukang was killed by the gun. Now that Zhang Xiaogen possessed the gun, he was suspected of involvement in the Lu Rukang murder case. The police station notified the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to send officers to take custody. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Zhang Xiaogen to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court for further interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated the above situation, and Gu Liancheng, the squad leader of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, arrived at the court, submitting an official document stating that Zhang Xiaogen was found to be related to the Lu Rukang assassination case, requesting permission to transfer him for interrogation. When questioned, Zhang Xiaogen claimed that he had found the handgun in Nanxiang during the January 28th Incident. He denied committing the assassination. Judge Tan Xinzhen ruled that Zhang Xiaogen was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for possessing military firearms and ammunition without permission. He was first handed over to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to be taken back for investigation. The gun and bullets were sent back to the police station for execution after the interrogation was completed.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Residents of Xujiahui Request the Municipal Government to Fill in the Zhaojiabang River; The River Water Turns Black – The Stench Reaches the Sky <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Chengxiang and others, representatives of the Notre Dame Convent of the Catholic Church in Xujiahui, Shanghai, and all merchants and residents of Xujiahui Town, submitted separate petitions to the Municipal Government's Health and Social Affairs Bureaus yesterday, stating that the stench in the Pu Zhaobang River in the town was affecting public health. They requested that officials be sent to inspect the area as soon as possible and find ways to fill in the river to prevent epidemics. The petition stated, "We, the residents of the Notre Dame Convent of the Catholic Church in Xujiahui Town and along Xujiahui Road, live on both sides of the Zhaojia Hong River. Since the Pu Zhaobang River was dredged the year before last, the foul water from the east has flowed in. We have built a dam west of the Tian Bridge to block the foul water and divert clear water from the south, which has greatly benefited the residents of the western countryside. However, outside the wall of the Notre Dame Convent, there is a place where the foul water is blocked. Since the river is cut off here, the foul water from the east cannot be discharged and accumulates over time, turning the water black as ink. It has now become a storage place for all kinds of filth. Even though the weather is still cold, the stench is already unbearable. It is conceivable that in the hot summer, the foul air will be overwhelming, and epidemics are to be feared. Moreover, the foul mud and water are where mosquitoes and flies breed. This area is at the intersection of the Chinese and foreign concessions. At a time when new initiatives are being promoted, leaving this stain not only hinders the appearance of the city but also damages international credibility as foreigners spread the word about it. Therefore, we specifically request that your bureau approve sending specialists to the town to inspect the area and fill in the 30-odd zhang of river from the Tianyao Bridge to the Li Zongjing port, turning it into a level ground. This would keep the foul water from the east far away, and residents would be less likely to throw their waste into the river. The public's health and the elimination of epidemics would depend on this. Moreover, filling in the river surface would create a useful area. The funds would not be wasted, and the people would receive tangible benefits. We are eagerly awaiting your order."</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Tofu Industry in This City Will Raise Prices Starting May 1st <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Tofu Industry Guild of this city stated that due to the recent soaring prices of raw materials and increased costs, the old wholesale market prices were causing huge losses. At the same time, the draft industry regulations also needed to be discussed. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, at 2:00 PM, the guild convened a general meeting of all members at the Tofu Industry Guild in Qiaojiazhai, Nanshi. Because the number of members present did not reach two-thirds of the total, the industry regulations could not be passed according to the law, so a discussion meeting was held instead. Tan Yueming, the chairman, reported that due to the soaring prices of soybeans recently, the costs had increased, and the old wholesale market prices were causing huge losses. As a result, no fewer than dozens of businesses in the same industry had ceased operations. At the same time, the guild's draft industry regulations had been prepared and urgently needed to be passed and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for record. For this reason, a general meeting of members was convened to discuss the matter together. Subsequently, the members present expressed their opinions separately and set new prices, which will be implemented uniformly by all businesses in the same industry starting on May 1st. The new price list is as follows: Tofu skin, 3 cents per sheet; old tofu, 100 wen per block; soft tofu, 1,200 wen per board, minimum 30 wen; coarse fried tofu, 24 cents per catty, minimum 60 wen; fine fried tofu, 32 cents per catty, minimum 60 wen; dried tofu skin, 22 cents per catty, 20 wen per sheet; fragrant (stinky) dried tofu, 30 cents per catty; fried tofu puff, 20 wen each; small square block, 10 wen each; fermented bean curd brick, 5 jiao per board; square cut, 3 jiao per board.</p>
<h3 id="e166">The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Explains the Accountants Ordinance; Handling Related Commissioned Matters in Different Locations Should Not Be Restricted by Article 16, Paragraph 1 of the Ordinance <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Accountants Association stated that Article 8 of the Accountants Ordinance stipulates that "Before an accountant begins to practice, he shall submit an application form, together with his certificate, to the local industrial and commercial administrative authority for verification and registration in the Accountants Register," and Article 16, Paragraph 1 stipulates that "An accountant may not practice in a province or city without joining the Accountants Association of that province or city." According to these regulations, in addition to applying for registration with the local industrial and commercial administrative authority, an accountant must also join the Accountants Association of the province or city where he practices, otherwise he may not practice. This is clearly stipulated in the ordinance and is not open to doubt. However, sometimes an accountant in Location A is commissioned by a company in that location to be an auditor or liquidator, and the company has branches in Locations B, C, D, and E. After being commissioned, the accountant needs to go to the branches in Locations B, C, D, and E to handle matters related to the commission. It is doubtful whether he should join the Accountants Associations in each of these locations. The association submitted a request for clarification, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued an instruction (Shang Zi No. 42998) explaining that "Since the accountant's business office is located in Location A, and the commissioned relationship with the company also occurred in Location A, then going to the branches in Locations B, C, D, and E to audit the accounts due to the related relationship is part of the work of handling the commissioned matter, and cannot be considered as practicing in each of these locations. However, establishing an office in a place other than the place of registration and membership in the association, soliciting commissioned matters, and handling them is different from the above situation and is still subject to the restrictions of Article 8 and Article 16 of the Accountants Ordinance," and so on.</p>

<p>Watanabe Tensho of the Toa Seigakuin in Kojimachi Ward, Tokyo, Japan, initiated and organized a Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Group, consisting of twenty members. They arrived in Shanghai at 3:50 PM yesterday aboard the Japanese Mail Steamship "Shanghai Maru." More than thirty male and female monks from the Japanese Buddhist Pilgrimage Group in Shanghai, holding small Japanese flags, went to the Wayside Wharf to welcome them. After arriving in Shanghai, the group stayed at the Bansai-kan Inn on Minhang Road in Hongkou. The group attended a Japanese Buddhist banquet last night and then went to visit various places in the city. They are scheduled to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Hangzhou from the North Station at 8:25 this morning. Tomorrow, they will visit Tiantai Mountain's Xiangguo Temple and other places. From the 25th to the 27th, they will visit Mt. Putuo and Ningbo's Yuantong Temple and Tiantong Mountain. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 28th, and on the 29th, they will visit Buddhist organizations in this city. On the 31st, they will take the next "Shanghai Maru" back to Japan. The purpose of this group's visit to China is to understand the essence of the Sui and Tang Dynasties in China, and to investigate the Buddhist holy sites along China's coast. At the same time, in view of the fact that Buddhist research in China is quite extensive, this trip was undertaken to strengthen the ties between the Buddhist communities of China and Japan. All of the members are prominent figures in the Japanese Buddhist community.</p>

<h3 id="e168">This Year's Total Solar Eclipses in Japan and Russia; Our Country Will Send Personnel to Participate in Observations; Yu Qingsong and Others Will Go to Japan, Zhang Yuzhe and Others Will Go to Russia; Participating in International Solar Eclipse Observations for the First Time <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Observing a total solar eclipse is of great importance to sciences such as astronomy, geography, and meteorology. When France was surrounded by Germany in the Tenth Century, French scientists flew in a balloon to break through the encirclement and observe the solar eclipse. The importance of this matter can be seen from this. On September 21st of the 30th year of the Republic of China, there will be a total solar eclipse passing through the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins of our country. At that time, various European countries will definitely come to China to observe it. Therefore, the Academia Sinica, Tsinghua University, the Astronomical Society, the Central Astronomical Observatory, and other organizations formed the Chinese Solar Eclipse Observation and Research Committee last year to prepare everything. This year, on June 19th, there will be a total solar eclipse in Japan and Russia. The committee has decided to send personnel to participate in the observations in order to practice and prepare for the observation of the total solar eclipse in the 30th year of the Republic of China. It is now learned that the Astronomical Observatory and the Chinese Astronomical Society have decided to send Yu Qingsong and Zheng Zungui to Hokkaido, Japan, and Zhang Yuzhe and Li Heng to Boli, Soviet Union, to participate in the observations. The observation items are divided into capturing solar corona images, solar radiation, meteorology, and geomagnetism. This is the first time that our country has sent representatives to participate in international solar eclipse observations. The four representatives are now preparing and will leave for Japan and Russia in the middle of next month. Because the mission is only to observe the solar eclipse, the time spent outside the country will not be very long.</p>

<p>The YMCA is preparing a novel mobile summer camp for boys, which is an emerging educational undertaking that aims to use the summer vacation to help boys develop their physical and mental well-being. Last summer, the Shanghai YMCA held one in Xikou, Fenghua, which was quite successful. This year, they plan to continue to organize it. Recently, Mr. Tian Xingen, the director of the YMCA's boys' department, went to Hangzhou to contact Mr. Qi Guangzi, the director of the Hangzhou YMCA's boys' department. This time, the Shanghai and Hangzhou YMCAs will cooperate to try to run a mobile boys' camp. The plan is to travel upstream along the Qiantang River in July for more than ten days, while still maintaining the camp's usual activities, such as learning typing, photography, swimming, and discussion. They will also take the opportunity to study the rural conditions along the coast and teach rural children proper group games, singing, and civic knowledge. This kind of approach is still a pioneering effort, and it is expected that the number of participants this year will be large, and the interest will be greatly increased.</p>

<h3 id="e172">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Ministry of Finance, Requesting a Modified Method for Collecting the Full Tax on Broken Rice <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance of the Nanjing Executive Yuan's Customs Administration yesterday, stating, "On the 20th of this month, the Mixed Grain and Oilseed Cake Industry Guild sent a letter stating that the Jianghai Customs had issued a notice that starting on April 11th of this year, broken rice imports would be subject to the full tax, and those who had already declared imports and paid taxes on that day would not be exempted. We believe that the government has been collecting half tax on broken rice imports in order to benefit the common people. The lives of the common people are difficult to make ends meet. The quality of domestic rice is good, but the price is expensive, and their ability to buy grain is limited. Broken rice is light and cheap, so it provides a source of food. This year, the domestic rice production does not seem to be lacking, so there is no need to increase the tax. The reason why merchants continue to order broken rice is to meet the needs of the common people. When they ordered it, they all calculated based on the half tax, and after the order was placed, the goods were sold to various households at the half tax price. In short, the merchants' cost calculations are all based on the half tax. Now, the amount ordered, according to the registered number of the same industry, is 12,300 tons. After hearing the news, in addition to the approximately 7,000 to 8,000 tons that have already been sold to foreign producers at a loss, there are still 4,000 to 5,000 tons that are about to be imported, have already been shipped, or have not yet been shipped. If the full tax is paid on all of these, each bag will increase by about 1.9 yuan in domestic currency. The merchants' estimated losses are huge and unbearable given the current economic downturn. We believe that the merchants originally ordered broken rice to provide food for the common people, but the sudden increase in the import tax will lead to losses, which is unbearable from a humanitarian point of view. Moreover, the broken rice was ordered before the customs issued the notice, and according to the law, it should not be applied retroactively. Therefore, we specifically ask the association to quickly telegraph the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Customs Administration, and instruct the Jianghai Customs to continue to collect half tax on broken rice imported before April 11th of this year in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties." Upon arrival, it was found that the import of broken rice is exclusively for the daily needs of the common people and has a wide sales range, so rice merchants import a large quantity of goods. Now, the change from half tax to full tax will increase the price per bag by nearly two yuan, making it difficult to sell and impossible to compensate. It is impossible to sell all of the imported or shipped goods abroad. If the full tax is suddenly levied according to the regulations, the rice merchants will face the risk of unbearable compensation, which may lead to difficulties in turnover and have a huge impact. Ningbo rice merchants have previously requested the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to appeal. This time, the Shanghai mixed grain industry has followed suit with a request. The association, in light of the merchants' situation, believes that it is necessary to make a modification. It is appropriate to report the situation by telegram and request the Ministry (Department) (Administration) to review and approve the request of the guild. All imports of broken rice ordered before April 11th should be permitted to continue to be subject to half tax by the Jianghai Customs in order to give rice merchants a slight breather and ease the urgent situation. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits.</p>

Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer first recounted the circumstances, stating that the hospital examination revealed that the girl was covered in injuries and burns and should be dealt with in accordance with Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. The judge ordered the bailiff to immediately send the girl to the forensic doctor for examination, which confirmed the presence of injuries. When questioned, Zhang Chen admitted that she had beaten Caiqin because Caiqin had stolen a cake from the table. She hired a lawyer to defend her.

<p>The blockbuster "Human Hell" has been advertised for a long time. "Human Hell," a Warner Brothers blockbuster in the same vein as "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," will be shown at the Shanghai Grand Theater on Beisichuan Road and Qiujiang Road starting today. It is rumored that the film is a shocking production of Warner Brothers this year. Because the company saw that "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang," starring Paul Muni, broke all records when it was released, and that such films are popular, it spent a lot of money to produce this extremely tense, terrifying, stimulating, and shocking blockbuster "Human Hell," a greater contribution than "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang." It is directed by the famous director Lois King and stars the young overlord, important character Donald Huaizhi, and the important female character Kailin Naik, who co-starred in "Iron-Blooded General." The performance of the entire cast in the film adds a lot of color to it. Yesterday, the theater invited reporters from all Shanghai newspapers to a preview screening, which was unanimously praised. The theater will show the film today at 3:00 PM, 5:15 PM, 7:15 PM, and 9:15 PM. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion with a lot of traffic.

<p>As for companies of other nationalities such as Italian, Swiss, and Austrian, their influence in Shanghai is extremely weak, so I will not go into detail.</p>
<p>3. Overview of Chinese Insurance Companies</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the oppression of foreign forces, Chinese people have gradually tended to take out insurance with Chinese insurance companies. Furthermore, due to rural bankruptcy in recent years, funds have rapidly concentrated in cities. With the excess capital of the banking industry, in addition to competing for speculative businesses such as real estate and public bonds, they have also invested a large amount of idle capital in the insurance industry. As a result, Chinese insurance companies have been able to flourish. Some financiers, compradors of foreign insurance companies, and insurance clerks with insurance experience have all joined forces with those with financial resources to compete in establishing insurance companies. Therefore, there are as many as twenty Chinese insurance companies in recent times. A list of the various branch head offices in Shanghai is given below:</p>

<p>Li Gongying Defeats Bernal 600 to 491 Yesterday - Bernal Creates New High Score Record of 79 Points</p>
<p>In the final match of the Fourth Sino-British International Billiards Championship, the billiards king Li Gongying made a final effort and defeated the Englishman Bernal with 600 points to 491 points. The Chinese team continued to retain the championship for the fourth consecutive year. The total score of the two teams was 2885 to 2717 points. The Chinese team won by a total of 168 points, the difference between the two sides not being too great, the game thus considered quite interesting. Yesterday, Bernal created a new high score record of 79 points on the 28th shot, and won the silver cup presented by Renji Foreign Firm. After the game, Mrs. Xu Junyi presented the award, and the Fourth Sino-British Billiards Championship came to a close amidst cheers. The billiards room of the Bank Club was packed with spectators yesterday, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Different Fortunes: After the opening speech by Lin Kanghou, the game began. Bernal took the first shot, followed by Li Gongying. As a result of the first three shots, Bernal scored nothing, and had not recorded any points by the fifth. Li, on the other hand, scored a large number of 54 points on the third shot, leading by 73 points to 4 points. Bernal was still dejected. By the tenth shot, Li had scored another 58 points in one shot, accumulating a score of 172 to 32 points, a difference of 140 points, reflecting the extremely different fortunes of the two men.</p>
<p>New Record Created: Despite Bernal's determination to fight back under this huge deficit, he was unable to make progress. By the 28th shot, the score was 296 to 229. Bernal's opportunity was beginning to appear. With a very skillful shot, he scored a record 79 points in one go, catching up with a score of 296 to 269, with a difference of only 27 points. This was one of the most tense periods of the game.</p>
<p>Victory Confirmed: Although Bernal scored this large number of points, he was unable to continue in the same vein. Li Gongying then scored 46 and 36 points in two consecutive shots, once again taking the lead. On the 36th shot, Li scored 60 points, bringing the score to 458 to 363, widening the gap again. Bernal scored 65 points on the 41st shot, still lagging behind by 40 points. Then Li also tried to create a new high score, but his final shot only scored 64 points. At this point, the Chinese team's victory was confirmed. The Chinese team's remaining deficit was also small, and the hope of a new record for the billiards king could only be left for the future. The final score was 600 to 491, with a total of 49 shots.</p>

The preliminary selection was previously scheduled for May 5th in Shanghai, the reselection for May 10th, and training was scheduled to begin on May 15th. Now, because the period between the preliminary selection and the training period is too long, resulting in excessive expenses for accommodation and food for personnel from various places staying in Shanghai, and to allow for sufficient preparation for the preliminary selection in various places, the selection dates have been rescheduled to May 11th for the preliminary selection and May 14th for the reselection. Training will still begin on May 15th. In this way, personnel staying in Shanghai will save time and money, and athletes from various places will have ample time to prepare.</p>

<p>(Beiping Special Dispatch) Registration for the track and field training class for China's participation in the World Games closed in Shanghai yesterday. However, the news about the track and field training class in recent days has been confusing and inconsistent. To obtain accurate information, the reporter went to Tsinghua University to inquire about everything. It turns out that those participating in the track and field training class had registered in Shanghai a few days ago, and registration only closed yesterday. According to a telegram from the National Sports Association to Mr. Ma Dehan, there were thirteen participants, but as of yesterday, only Peng Yongxin and Zhang Lingjia, who are at Tsinghua, and Liu Changchun and Zhou Changxing from Nanjing, Dong Shuzhao from Shanghai, and Zhang Yinming from Australia, Hebei, had registered in Beiping. Training was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, but Mr. Ma Dehan and Xia Xiang, the deputy instructor of the track and field training class, discussed that if training took place before the athletes' results were tested, the athletes would be too tired and the results would be affected. Therefore, it was decided to begin training after the results were tested. As for the date of the results test, if a large number of athletes who registered in Shanghai today (21st) can arrive in Beiping, then the test will be held on the 24th. If the athletes cannot arrive in Beiping today, the test will be postponed. The date for the start of training may be on the 27th of this month. The Tsinghua University Spring Sports Meeting is on the 25th, and the Tsinghua Commemoration Meeting is on the 26th, so it is difficult to start training then. The athletes who have already registered at Tsinghua, except for Zhang Lingjia, such as Liu Changchun, Dong Shuzhao, Zhou Changxing, Peng Yongxin, and Zhang Yinming, have been practicing on their own at the Tsinghua University field since yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e196">The China Physical Education Federation Basketball League: Hujiang High School Affiliated Middle School Victorious over Minli Yesterday; Score 23 to 17. Fuzhong Defeats Fushi: Score 35 to 33. Guanghua Defeats Private Shang: <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The China Physical Education Federation's men's basketball league, this year's competition, began the day before yesterday at the Shenyuan basketball court. Yesterday was the second day, with a total of three matches. The first match was Fuzhong versus Fushi, a brotherly competition. Both sides were evenly matched, so the competition was exceptionally intense. In the first half, Fuzhong relied on coordinated teamwork to take the lead with a score of 12 to 9. In the second half, although Fushi had renewed vigor, their shooting accuracy was lacking, and they frequently missed good opportunities, losing again with a score of 8 to 11. The final result was 23 to 17, with Fuzhong winning. The second match was Guanghua versus Private Shang. The two teams were evenly matched, and the game was hard-fought. In the first half, Guanghua had a strong momentum, taking the lead with a score of 16 to 9. In the second half, Private Shang changed their strategy, and the entire team worked harder, winning with a score of 24 to 19. However, they still lost with an overall score of 35 to 33. The third match was Hujiang versus Minli. Hujiang's strength was formidable, and Minli was far from their match, so the game became one-sided. In the first half, Hujiang used deceptive tactics and had a blazing momentum, taking the lead with a huge score of 29 to 6. In the second half, Hujiang brought in a large number of fresh troops, and Minli took the opportunity to attack. However, due to their weaker overall strength, they still lost. The result was 55 to 21. Today, because the Shenyi Yuan ball court is hosting a Melling's boxing match, the league will be suspended for one day. Yesterday's results and tomorrow's schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Fuzhong defeats Fushi: 23 to 17</p>

<p>The third day of the China-West handball competition featured four singles matches. National team players Zhu Kuan and Sun Jialu participated. Handball king Zhu Kuan lived up to his reputation. In the first match against Anagavov, Mr. An was also a fierce competitor. In the first game, he fought tenaciously, but the result was still a victory for the handball king by a score of 21 to 15. In the second game, Zhu unleashed his might, and An's skills were exhausted. After a fierce battle, Zhu won 21 to 4, and An was almost completely defeated. The second game was F. Smith against Ti Quek Kay Ling. Mr. Ti did not give way, winning two games in a row with scores of 21 to 10 and 21 to 12. The third game was Sun Jialu against Campbell (temporarily switched with Smith against Bainat). The situation was lopsided.

<p>VI. Sports Facilities</p>
<p>The equipment of the school's gymnasium can be called the best in China. Even many domestic universities probably do not have such perfect facilities. The interior of the gymnasium is very large, and all kinds of indoor physical education activities or basketball games can be held in it. Next to the gymnasium, there are also sports instructor's offices, first aid stations, student bathrooms, changing rooms, toilets, etc. Each room is connected to water heating pipes, which can provide hot air; so even in the harsh winter, the school's students can change into thin sportswear and participate in various physical activities in the gymnasium without getting cold.</p>
<p>The equipment inside the gymnasium is really new and complete. Next to the wall on the right hand side of the entrance is a row of fixed indoor durable wall bars, with a long bench for the wall bars placed underneath. Another row is filled with many three-foot-long gymnastic bars. In front of it is installed a kind of large beam for silver chain body balance: it can be folded up when not in use, does not take up space, and can be moved out when needed. In another corner, there is a kind of iron frame with adjustable height. Behind it, there are two vertical ladders for practicing arm grip and climbing. On the left, there is another door leading to the playground. On both sides of the door, there are two machines for practicing arm and chest rowing movements. In another corner, there is a kind of leather bag and large ball for practicing boxing.

<h3 id="e215">Securities: Some Are Buying This Month; Bulls of Public Bonds Are Becoming More Solid <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, because the April futures contracts only had two days left, many shorts for this month were buying to cover positions due to the recent use of legal tender by various groups, feeling constrained. Generally, those without goods to deliver had to cover or roll over. Although the method of using legal tender seemed profitable, the deadline was approaching, ending on May 3. Therefore, those buying to cover in April could still manage to do so, but after that, it would be invalid. Therefore, the May futures were no longer restricted by this. The future market price may only see a larger change after the April futures cease. The trend was relatively stable yesterday, but there were still no signs of relaxation. It briefly retraced slightly the day before, then immediately bounced back. The strength of the bulls was evident and still solid. The market was initially flat in the morning, then gradually turned firm by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. The closing was still stable. Class C bonds rose another 0.0025 yuan, and the rest also rose by about 0.001 yuan. Numbers 4, 16, and 35 were mostly bought, and Number 11 had already emerged.

There were mixed gains and losses, with only a difference of about 0.0005 or 0.001 yuan. As a result, the market price, except for Class D long-term bonds which were down 0.0005 yuan, the rest rose by 0.001 to 0.003 yuan. The total transaction volume was only 3,765,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the downtrend is gradually emerging. Due to the April delivery, there are only two trading days left, and there is sufficient delivery volume. Generally, floating long positions that do not intend to take delivery are cutting losses according to the market. The market has revealed gaps, and long-term contracts are also affected. The September contract broke the 210 yuan mark and then entered within 9 yuan.</p>
<p>Standard yarn fell 1.34 yuan. The standard yarn market opened weak across all months, and trading was sparse. It rose by 0.001 or 0.002 yuan. After the second session, it turned weak, but selling pressure was not strong, and it declined slowly. This was because there was sufficient volume for delivery this month, and buyers were lacking. The market sentiment worsened. As a result, each month fell by 0.002, 0.005, and 0.007 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The market opened lower in the afternoon, and this month was quite weak. The situation was unstable, breaking the 3 yuan mark.

<p>The cotton market, which had been firm and high for many days, will also tend to decline, and the downtrend is also strong.

The May and June contracts have all broken the 5 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Standard cotton fell by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. The standard cotton market opened lower across all months. Indian cotton, which had risen for many days, retraced by 1 rupee. US cotton was still down previously and up yesterday, with little effect, rising by 0.02 to 0.07 pounds. Osaka Sanshin cotton rose by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. The market price was suppressed because the goods approved by the cotton inspection office for delivery this month had already exceeded 100,000 bales, and people's confidence was slightly shaken. As a result, each month fell by 0.001 or 0.002 yuan compared to the previous day's close. When the market opened lower in the afternoon, Tongji sold a large amount this month, and the market price turned weak. Sellers were active, and the market price was unstable.

Afterwards, colleagues absorbed old cotton, and Liverpool and the Far East bought new cotton, and the market turned higher.

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai silk market was quiet, and foreign silk prices fell again. Lyon daily silk fell by 2 French francs per kilogram, causing French sales in Shanghai to be sluggish. New York Shanghai silk also fell by 0.03 yuan, so there was no hope of transactions. The export of raw silk has to wait. The intake of domestic silk factories also has no improvement.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the market for each month was initially stable, then slightly returned to a flat state. The quotation for foreign wheat was down 0.016 yuan in Chicago and up 0.004 yuan in Canada. At the time of opening, it was rumored that Tianjin merchants imported more than 200,000 bags of spot flour, priced at the previous day's closing price, or increased by 0.0005 yuan. Therefore, people's confidence was boosted, and each month was up by 0.00075 to 0.001 yuan. Later, the market was slightly down again due to long positions selling. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was still smooth, and there was no change in price. It was said that reports from various places on the wheat seedling situation were quite smooth, so people's confidence could not be excessively suppressed. However, the transition between new and old crops in June made people's confidence relatively stable.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Wheat Merchants Are Mostly Watching; Little Progress in Wheat Futures <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for wheat futures presented an initial flat and then stable state in the morning. The quotations for foreign wheat fluctuated, and the weather was suitable, so the confidence of people inside and outside the industry was relatively relaxed. Therefore, the initial price was slightly soft, but the quotation was slightly better and rebounded slightly due to the transfer of sellers. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading turned sparse, and the price fluctuated a lot. Because most wheat merchants from various routes were watching, both sides were guarding and there was little progress. The spot wheat market was slightly weak, but the goods were more decisive, and the quotation was 0.002 yuan lower. More than 900 bags of Kaiyao Bay Nansu wheat, priced at 5.3 yuan, were handled by Fuxin Shen Da.</p>
<p>US wheat: There was sporadic light rain in Kansas, which was beneficial to the crops, but insufficient. The weather forecast is clear. Factories are buying the May contract. Winnipeg market is firm and exports are very strong.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources from various groups, with a total of more than 7,000 stones of goods. The sales market in this street was still weak, so the market situation was still stable. The price of thick early japonica rice had no honor or disgrace. Although there were still some Tianjin and Yantai groups buying, the intake was not as smooth as before, so the high-quality Bo rice was not sold. However, the situation seemed to be still tight. The price of Duyangjian Yinyuan remained flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived from Hexia. Due to the rain, the market opened with customers bidding tightly for Baijing rice. The market closed weakly, and the price was irregular. The price of Bianyuan goods was mostly sluggish. The price of high-quality goods was soft and decisive, with a difference of 0.06 or 0.07 yuan. The prices of other types of rice were firm.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for customer indica rice was even more tired and lifeless. Because the customer stockpiles have been stagnant in Mu Street for a long time, and a new batch of Saigon rice has been imported, most people in the market are weak, so the stockpilers are very firm and unwilling to sell easily. Therefore, the market can still be supported, but there were no transactions at all in the morning. In the afternoon, there were more than 200 bags of Jiangxi rice and 400 bags of Wenzhou rice in this street for socializing. Although the market was similar to the previous market, it was still soft in essence.</p>

<p>There are three types of black fin: the tail fin is called black hook, the fin on the back is called black skin, and the fin under the neck is called black sheep. The goods from the origin are usually sold as a whole set, that is, the hook, skin, and sheep are packaged together. The merchant sells them at a negotiated price. Occasionally, they are shipped in separate grades, but the number is small. The quality of those produced in the Hokkaido area of Japan is the best, because its roots are lighter and the fins are soft and glutinous and easy to swell in water, called Xiangguan goods. The goods from Kobe, Yokohama, Nagasaki, etc. have particularly heavy meat roots and reduced fin volume, so it is difficult to compare with Xiangguan, and the market price is also very different. There are also Taiwanese goods, the meat roots are light, but the slices are very small. Compared with Japanese goods, they are almost one to three. The sales of customer groups are also different. Therefore, no one has been heard to purchase whole goods. The original goods purchased by the experts must be selected and graded for sale. For example, black hooks are mostly sold in Tianjin, Hankou, Guangdong, and this street. Black skins are most popular in Nanjing and Suzhou. Black sheep are sold in various ports in Jiangbei. The current market price for top-grade Xiangguan black hooks is 210 yuan, 180-190 yuan for large pieces, and 150-160 yuan for medium pieces. Top-grade black skins are 160 yuan, large pieces are 130 yuan, and medium pieces are 100 yuan. Top-grade black sheep are 80 yuan, large pieces are 65 yuan, and medium pieces are 40 yuan. Goods from Yokohama, Kobe, and Nagasaki can be reduced by about 30 yuan for each grade. The price of Taiwanese top-grade black hooks is 120 yuan, top-grade black skins are 50 yuan, and top-grade black sheep are 20 yuan.</p>

<p>According to a telegram from Shantou, the Chaoshan sugar price has fallen by more than 10 yuan to 1,150 yuan due to the decrease in exchange rates. Therefore, the production price has loosened, with green sugar falling by 0.03 yuan and red sugar falling by 0.05 or 0.06 yuan. Therefore, the Shanghai market has also weakened, with only 36 bags of ordinary cotton red sugar opened at 12.6 yuan, slightly lower than before. In addition, the Jian group continued to open 300 bags of Tianjin Diao green sugar at 9.8 yuan.</p>
<p>The public association's pricing trend is still tired. 22 bags of No. 24 coarse white sand sugar spot are 6.9 yuan for re-export, and MS are 15 yuan, with no changes. Spot Dongbai No. 4 is 21.8 yuan, No. 8 is 21.5 yuan, both down 0.005 yuan. No. 9 is 21.3 yuan, down 0.01 yuan. Re-export No. 4 white is 6.85 yuan, No. 8 is 6.5 yuan, and No. 9 is 6.3 yuan, down 0.006 to 0.01 yuan. The prices of cotton white sugar from this factory, such as Zhenji, Dahua, and Jinxin, are all at the original price with no changes, and the market is weak.</p>

The Hankou group imported more than 30 boxes of Meihong Guangzhong Factory striped plain Fuji silk, and the Hengzhou group imported more than 20 boxes of Guangzhong plain Fuji silk. Because the bandit situation in Yunnan has subsided slightly, all goods have been telegraphed for price inquiries.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Lin Xiangru and Lian Po <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Kan Tzu</p>
<p>Lin Xiangru and Lian Po were both from the state of Zhao during the late Warring States period. One came from a poor and humble background, while the other was a prominent and powerful figure. They lived during the Warring States period, when seven powerful states (Qin, Chu, Qi, Zhao, Han, Wei, and Yan) coexisted. At that time, each state needed talented individuals to expand its territory or defend against enemies. Therefore, whoever was capable could seize opportunities to become a high-ranking official.</p>
<p>After the death of King Wuling of Zhao (295 BC), although Zhao still possessed some residual power and influence, the "vertical alliance" had disintegrated, and the strength of Qin had accumulated. Zhao could not avoid being coerced by Qin. The people of Zhao were divided: the weak sought to appease Qin for temporary peace, while the strong considered it a disgrace to appease Qin and strived to find ways to save the country. Lin Xiangru and Lian Po were among the strong in Zhao, but due to their different circumstances, their methods of saving the country also differed.</p>
<p>Lian Po was a skilled general in Zhao, capable of winning battles and capturing territory. Naturally, he had opportunities to save the country. Lin Xiangru, on the other hand, came from a poor family and was raised in the household of the eunuch Miao Xian from a young age. Miao Xian was favored by King Huiwen of Zhao (King Wuling's son). He was wealthy and powerful, and like other prominent officials of the time, he supported many retainers. However, he was busy serving King Huiwen and could not discern who was good and who was bad. As Lin Xiangru grew older, he felt ashamed to be a retainer of a eunuch. However, the society at the time was corrupt, making it difficult to find a way out. Moreover, he was eager to serve his country and felt compelled to humble himself to achieve his goals. He often comforted himself, saying, "Personal reputation is a small matter, saving the country and the people is a great matter. If I can emulate Shang Yang and strengthen Zhao as he strengthened Qin, even if I die after achieving success, even if later generations despise my humble origins as a retainer of a eunuch, I would be content." But how could he impress Miao Xian and get him to introduce him to King Huiwen? This was a difficult problem to solve.</p>
<p>One day, an opportunity for him to be appreciated by Miao Xian arrived. Miao Xian unintentionally offended King Huiwen and, fearing punishment, hurriedly packed his belongings to flee to the state of Yan. When his retainers heard this news, they feared being implicated and fled. When Miao Xian sent someone to ask them for advice, only Lin Xiangru came forward. Miao Xian felt that he still had courage and told him his plan to flee to Yan. After listening to Miao Xian, Xiangru stopped him and said, "How do you know that the King of Yan will definitely take you in? If he rejects you or does not treat you with respect, you will have no way out and regret it too late!" Miao Xian replied, "I know that the King of Yan will treat me well. I once accompanied the King (referring to the King of Zhao) to meet the King of Yan on the border. The King of Yan secretly held my hand and said he wanted to befriend me. Therefore, I know the King of Yan likes me, so I want to go and rely on him today." Xiangru shook his head and said, "You are mistaken. Because Zhao is strong and Yan is weak, and you are favored by the King of Zhao, the King of Yan wanted to befriend you. Now that you have offended the King of Zhao and are fleeing to Yan, Yan, fearing Zhao, will certainly not take you in. They will detain you and send you back, which would be a dead end! You should rather bare your arms, carry the instruments of punishment on your back, and plead guilty to the King of Zhao. The King of Zhao is kind and gentle and will surely have mercy on you and pardon your crime." Miao Xian listened to Xiangru's words and was indeed pardoned. From then on, he recognized Xiangru as a man of vision and held him in high regard.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth year of King Huiwen of Zhao, the state of Qin intended to destroy the state of Han and annex the Eastern Zhou. Knowing that the states hated Qi, Qin used Qi as bait to lure Zhao, Han, Wei, and Yan to attack Qi. Qin calculated that after defeating Qi, the states would be exhausted and unable to resist Qin. At that time, Qin could do as it pleased. King Huiwen, unaware of the plot, constantly sent troops to attack Qi. After two years of fighting, it was Lian Po's turn to be the general. He was very brave and skilled in battle and indeed defeated Qi and captured the city of Jinyang. King Huiwen was very pleased and appointed Lian Po as High Minister.</p>
<p>After prolonged warfare, the state of Zhao needed to rest and recuperate. The state of Qin, with malicious intentions, took the opportunity to create trouble for Zhao. At that time, King Huiwen obtained the He Shi Bi jade from the state of Chu, which King Zhaoxiang of Qin learned of and wanted to obtain through deception. He sent a letter to the King of Zhao, saying he was willing to exchange fifteen cities for the jade. After receiving the letter, the King of Zhao immediately discussed it with General Lian Po and other ministers. They feared that if they gave the jade to Qin, they would not receive the fifteen cities and would be deceived by Qin. If they refused to give it, they feared that Qin would send troops to forcibly demand it. They did not know what to do. Therefore, they decided to find an envoy with both wisdom and courage to reply to Qin. Unable to find a suitable person at the time, the King of Zhao summoned Lin Xiangru upon Miao Xian's recommendation. The King of Zhao asked Xiangru, "The King of Qin wants to exchange fifteen cities for my jade. Can I give it to him?" Xiangru replied, "Qin is strong and Zhao is weak. We cannot refuse." The King asked again, "What if he takes my jade and does not give me the cities?" Xiangru explained, "If Qin asks to exchange cities for the jade and Zhao refuses, Zhao is in the wrong. If Zhao gives the jade and Qin does not give Zhao the cities, Qin is in the wrong. Comparing the two, it is better to agree to Qin and let them bear the blame for deceit." The King of Zhao agreed with Xiangru and asked him who could be sent to Qin. Xiangru replied, "Your Majesty cannot find a suitable person. I am willing to take the jade. I will only leave the jade with Qin if Zhao obtains the cities. Otherwise, I will definitely bring the entire jade back intact." At that time, many people who looked down on Lin Xiangru said he was boasting and urged the King of Zhao not to listen to him. The King of Zhao overcame the opposition and finally sent Xiangru as an envoy.</p>
<p>Xiangru bid farewell to the King of Zhao, hid the jade, and took several reliable warriors, heading west to Qin. On the way, Xiangru thought of ways to deal with the King of Qin, looking very serious. His followers thought he was afraid of entering the powerful state of Qin, fearing misfortune, and secretly laughed at his cowardice. In fact, he had already disregarded his own life and death. At that time, his only concern was "how to avoid humiliating the country."</p>
<p>They arrived in Qin. The King of Qin thought his deceptive scheme had succeeded. Seeing that the envoy who brought the jade was a bookish scholar, he became even less wary. When Xiangru arrived, he was sitting in the Zhangtai Palace, entertaining himself with a group of beautiful women. He received Xiangru there. Xiangru personally held the jade and presented it to the King of Qin. The King of Qin, upon seeing the crystal-clear jade and its emerald-green luster, was very pleased. He immediately passed it to his beautiful women and attendants for appraisal. Everyone admired it and cheered "Long live the King!" Xiangru stood there like an extra person, and no one paid attention to him. Xiangru realized that the King of Qin had no intention of exchanging the cities for the jade. He then walked up to the King of Qin and said, "The jade has a flaw. Please allow me to point it out to Your Majesty." The King of Qin immediately gave him the jade. Xiangru took the jade, held it firmly, and retreated a dozen steps, leaning against a pillar. His face turned terrible, his forehead was covered with veins, his hair stood on end, and his hat was about to fall off. In his great anger, he pressed his head against the pillar, straightened his back, and loudly rebuked the King of Qin, saying:</p>
<p>"Your Majesty wanted to obtain this jade and sent a letter to the King of Zhao. Upon receiving your message, the King of Zhao immediately summoned all his ministers for discussion. Everyone said, 'Qin is greedy and relies on its military strength, using the excuse to deceive us for our jade. The promised fifteen cities will probably not be obtained.' Therefore, they considered not giving the jade to Qin. Only I disagreed, saying, 'Even between commoners, there can be deception, let alone between great states? Moreover, offending a great state for such a small matter as a piece of jade is not advisable.' The King of Zhao then listened to my words, fasted for five days, and solemnly handed the jade and a reply letter to me in the court. Why did he do that? Because he respected the great state and showed particular respect. Today, when I arrived, Your Majesty casually received me in the Zhangtai Palace, with very arrogant etiquette. After obtaining the jade, you passed it to the beautiful women to mock me. I saw that Your Majesty had no intention of giving the cities in exchange for the jade. Therefore, I took back the jade. If Your Majesty insists on forcing me, my head and the jade will immediately be smashed on this pillar for Your Majesty to see!" After Xiangru finished speaking, he held the jade in both hands, looking askance at the pillar, posing as if he were about to smash it.</p>
<p>The King of Qin feared that Xiangru would really break the jade. He hurriedly got up to apologize and earnestly asked him not to do so. At this time, the timid beautiful women, frightened and flustered, fled back to the inner palace before the King of Qin could even give the order. The King of Qin then ordered the officials in charge of maps to bring in the map of Qin and point out the fifteen cities from here to there that would be given to Zhao. Xiangru guessed that the King of Qin was deceiving him and would not be fooled. However, to fulfill his promise to the King of Zhao to "return the jade intact" and to uphold his principle of "not humiliating the country," he had to feign compliance with the King of Qin. He said to the King of Qin, "The He Shi Bi jade is a treasure known to the world. The King of Zhao, fearing Your Majesty, dared not refuse to offer it to Your Majesty. The King of Zhao fasted for five days when he sent the jade. Now Your Majesty should also fast for five days and set up the nine-guest ceremony in the court to receive the jade with respect. Only then will I dare to offer the jade." The King of Qin knew that he could not forcibly snatch the jade from Xiangru's hands and had to agree. He asked Xiangru to stay in the Guangcheng Inn to wait.</p>
<p>Xiangru returned to the guesthouse and regained his freedom. He guessed that even though the King of Qin had agreed to fast, he would definitely break his promise and not give Zhao the cities in the future. Therefore, he sent one of the warriors who had come with him, dressed in coarse cloth, disguised as a small merchant, to hide the jade and escape back to Zhao via a side road.</p>
<p>The King of Qin fasted for five days and set up the nine-guest ceremony in the court to receive the envoy of Zhao, Lin Xiangru. Xiangru, upon seeing the King of Qin, was not afraid at all. He first thanked the King of Qin for the grand ceremony and then frankly said to the King of Qin, "Since the time of Duke Mu of Qin, there have been more than twenty rulers who have never truly fulfilled international promises. I fear being deceived by Your Majesty and betraying the state of Zhao. Therefore, I sent someone to send the jade back to Zhao first. You see, Qin is strong and Zhao is weak. If Your Majesty sends an envoy to ask for the jade, Zhao will immediately offer the jade, not afraid of being deceived by a great state. Now that Qin is so strong, if you first cede fifteen cities to Zhao, how dare Zhao keep the jade and offend Your Majesty? I know that deceiving Your Majesty is a crime punishable by death. I have come here to ask for death, hoping that Your Majesty and your ministers will deliberate carefully." The King of Qin and his ministers, unexpectedly hearing these words, looked at each other, both surprised and angry. Everyone gnashed their teeth in hatred. Xiangru remained calm, looking back to see that the warriors who had laughed at his cowardice had been frightened to the point of being pale.</p>
<p>After a while, the King of Qin's anger subsided. His attendants wanted to execute Xiangru, but the King of Qin said to them, "Now that we have killed Xiangru, we still cannot obtain the jade, and we will sever the relationship between Qin and Zhao. It is better to treat him well and send him back to Zhao. Would the King of Zhao deceive Qin for the sake of a piece of jade?" As a result, he received Xiangru with courtesy and sent him back to his country. Xiangru returned to the state of Zhao, and the King of Zhao, because he had served as an envoy without dishonoring the country, considered him virtuous and appointed him as a high minister. Later, the state of Qin did not give the cities to the state of Zhao, and the state of Zhao did not give the jade to the state of Qin.</p>
<p>After a few years, the King of Qin sent someone to tell the King of Zhao that he wanted to meet with the King of Zhao at Mianchi, outside the western He River, to strengthen their relationship. The King of Zhao feared Qin and did not want to go. Xiangru and Lian Po thought that the King's refusal to go would show weakness and greatly humiliate the country. They urged the King of Zhao to go. The King of Zhao had no choice but to go with Xiangru. Lian Po personally escorted them to the border and bid farewell to the King, saying, "Your Majesty, I have calculated that, including the time for travel and gathering, you should return to the country within thirty days. If you do not return after thirty days, I will request that the crown prince be made king to disappoint Qin." The King of Zhao knew that this was the best way to protect the country and consolidate his power, and of course, he agreed.</p>
<p>The King of Qin's invitation to the King of Zhao was actually made with malicious intentions. He originally wanted to wait for the King of Zhao to say "no" so that he could use it as an excuse to send troops to attack the state of Zhao. Unexpectedly, the King of Zhao dared to attend the meeting, which made it difficult for him. He decided to change his approach and use the occasion to humiliate the King of Zhao, making him lose face when he returned to the country. But the prime minister of the King of Zhao was Lin Xiangru, who handled everything according to etiquette, without revealing any flaws. However, the King of Qin was determined to find an opportunity to humiliate the King of Zhao. When the King of Qin was drinking and becoming slightly drunk, he pretended to be very amiable and said to the King of Zhao, "I have heard that the King of Zhao is very good at music. Please grant us a zither performance!" His attendants seized the opportunity to present the zither to the King of Zhao. The King of Zhao, unaware that the King of Qin was intentionally making fun of him, thought that playing along with the occasion would not matter and readily accepted the zither and began to play. After the King of Zhao finished playing the zither, the Qin historian stepped forward and wrote, "On such and such a day, the King of Qin and the King of Zhao met and drank, and the King of Qin ordered the King of Zhao to play the zither." Xiangru knew that the King of Zhao had fallen into a trap. He quickly stepped forward and said, "The King of Zhao has heard that the King of Qin is skilled in Qin music. Please take out a basin and jug and let the King of Qin and the King of Zhao entertain each other." The King of Qin was angry and refused to agree. So Xiangru himself took the jug, knelt, and presented it to the King of Qin. The King of Qin refused to strike the jug. Xiangru frowned and loudly said to the King of Qin, "If Your Majesty is not willing to strike the jug, it shows that Your Majesty intends to humiliate the state of Zhao. In that case, Xiangru will splatter the blood from my neck on Your Majesty within these five steps!" The King of Qin's attendants wanted to kill Xiangru, but Xiangru glared at them and rebuked them, and they all retreated in fear. The King of Qin was very upset and had no choice but to strike the jug reluctantly. Xiangru turned around and ordered the Zhao historian to write, "On such and such a day, the King of Qin struck the jug for the King of Zhao." The Qin ministers asked the King of Zhao to offer fifteen cities to the King of Qin as a birthday gift. Xiangru also asked the King of Qin to offer the capital of Qin, Xianyang, to the King of Zhao as a birthday gift. Tit for tat, Zhao never showed weakness. The King of Qin also saw that the King of Zhao had a strong military presence and knew that the state of Zhao had been prepared for a long time. He dared not act rashly and had to acknowledge his bad luck, allowing the King of Zhao to return to his country safely.</p>
<p>The King of Zhao returned to the state of Zhao, and because Xiangru had made great contributions, he appointed him as a high minister, with a higher position than Lian Po. Lian Po was unconvinced and said, "As a general of Zhao, I have made great contributions in attacking cities and fighting in the field. Lin Xiangru only relied on his eloquence. Now his position is actually higher than mine. There is no such reason! Moreover, Xiangru was originally a lowly person. I am actually below him. How can I not be ashamed?" He also declared, "If I see Xiangru, I will definitely humiliate him."</p>
<p>When Xiangru heard what Lian Po said, he refused to meet him. Every time it was his turn to attend court, Xiangru would always claim illness, not wanting to compete with Lian Po for position. When Xiangru went out, if he saw Lian Po in the distance, he would immediately change his route to avoid him. Xiangru's followers felt that Xiangru's fear of Lian Po was a great shame and urged Xiangru, saying, "The reason we left our relatives to serve you is only because we admire your high moral character. Now that you and Lian Po are colleagues, and Lian Po speaks ill of you, you actually avoid him, fearing him to such an extent. Even ordinary people would feel ashamed of this, let alone generals and ministers? We are unwilling to endure this and have come to bid you farewell." Xiangru asked them, "Who do you think is more formidable, General Lian or the King of Qin?" They answered in unison, "General Lian is no match." Xiangru then further said to them, "You see, with the King of Qin's power, Xiangru dared to rebuke him in court and humiliate his ministers. Although Xiangru is useless, how can I be afraid of General Lian alone? However, I think that the reason why the powerful Qin dares not send troops against Zhao is only because there are the two of us. If the two tigers fight, they will inevitably not both survive. No matter which of us is injured or killed, Qin troops will come to the border of Zhao sooner or later. The reason why I would rather suffer losses myself and not fight with General Lian is to prioritize the country's crisis over personal feuds." Xiangru's followers then realized the truth and marveled at Xiangru's greatness.</p>
<p>Xiangru's words quickly spread to Lian Po. Lian Po, upon hearing them, was ashamed and constantly reproached himself, saying, "I am a true villain! I am a true villain!" So he asked a guest to mediate with Xiangru, bared his upper body, carried thorns on his back, and personally went to Xiangru's residence to apologize, saying, "I, a lowly person, did not know that you, sir, were so generous!" Xiangru, hearing Lian Po's remorseful words, could not help but be moved to tears. Later, the two became very good friends, and the state of Zhao prospered because of their cooperation, and no one dared to bully it again.</p>
<p>Publishing World</p>
<p>A Special Publication for the "Poverty is Not a Crime" Performance</p>
<p>At the invitation of the Shanghai Theatre, this association has compiled the position of the current "Publishing World" into a special publication for the "Poverty is Not a Crime" performance, to be presented to the audience of "Poverty is Not a Crime." We respectfully request that readers pay attention to it!</p>
<p>Respectfully presented by the Publishing Affairs Committee of the China Cultural Construction Association.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Revision of the Script for "Poverty is Not a Crime" <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Peiliang</p>
<p>The Shanghai Theatre's decision to perform "Poverty is Not a Crime" is based on Zheng Zhenduo's translation and has been revised. There are three types of revisions:</p>
<p>Revisions of wording are almost everywhere. Because Zheng's translation often does not conform to colloquial language. To make it clear and fluent on stage, it is necessary to revise the wording at any time. Furthermore, sometimes the wording may conform to colloquial language, but it may not be appropriate for the way the character speaks, and it must be revised. I do not understand Russian, so I can only base my revisions on the translation, striving not to lose the original meaning. The names of people have also been shortened.</p>
<p>The lyrics have all been completely rewritten because the original translation was too long, the sentences were cumbersome, and it was impossible to set them to music. There are also too many songs in the original play, so it was necessary to slightly delete and merge them to avoid being too lengthy on stage. After the deletion and merging, about one-third of the songs were removed, leaving only ten songs, with the most in the second act and only one large chorus in the third act.</p>
<p>The most important revisions are the changes in the plot of the second act. The first act was not changed except for the deletion of two songs. The third act was almost completely unchanged. The second act, in addition to deleting a section, also added a section. The deleted parts were the two old couples among the guests, the old man singing, the person bringing the bear to perform tricks, etc. The added part is Guo Ping's appearance shortly after the opening. Guo Ping did not appear in the original second act.</p>
<p>Ostrovsky wrote this play, paying special attention to expressing the local flavor of Christmas, in addition to the theme. He tried his best to create an atmosphere of Christmas in a village. In the author's intention, he sympathized with the old women and loved those ancient and simple things, contrasting them with the vain Guo Tai and He Lijia. From a national perspective, Guo and his brother, who wasted everything, were very similar, so the author wanted to bring him back.</p>
<p>However, this level of meaning cannot be expressed on the Chinese stage. This kind of local Christmas Eve atmosphere, not to mention that we cannot create it, even if we could, would still be foreign to the Chinese audience. Those songs are folk songs that everyone in Russia knows, so they sound intimate and pleasant, and no one gets tired of them. But it's not the same in China. For example, even if we can find a person and a bear to perform tricks on stage, it will only disrupt the atmosphere of the entire play and will not have any other results. Therefore, we boldly deleted this part.</p>
<p>As I have already said, the original author's efforts to describe the Christmas atmosphere were by no means just to create a lively scene on stage, but to express a contrast between the original simple flavor of the countryside and the superficial civilization that is admired from abroad. The enthusiastic and innocent singing and dancing of the countryside versus the homemade sweet wine and champagne of the Moscow band, the sincere youth of the hometown versus the pseudo-merchants who only pretend to be important—all these are contrasts. Since we have removed the part of the plot that creates the atmosphere, we must find a way to make up for this loss, so as not to reduce the power of the original work. Therefore, we added the scene of Guo Ping's appearance.</p>
<p>This section is based on the last dialogue of the first act. Guo Ping tells Mi Diya that he asked his brother to take him in, but his request was not accepted. So we actually put this into the performance on stage, making the opposition between Guo Tai's and He Lijia's group and the other group, Guo's wife, her daughter, Guo Ping, and even the nanny, more intense, and the conflict between the two sides more obvious. Perhaps the author's original intention can be expressed a little more.</p>
<p>As for the love affair between Mi Diya and Guo Yena, it was originally just a thread to connect the story and was not important. So we still follow the old practice and do not particularly emphasize this part in the direction, but pay more attention to the opposition between the two groups.</p>
<p>We hope that these changes will not cause too much loss to the original play.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Ostrovsky's Immortal Characteristics <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Tian</p>
<p>In all aspects, we feel Ostrovsky's unique value. Among the forty works he wrote, each has its own dramatic quality that transcends skill. The characters in each play appear naturally in suitable spaces, and each story develops in a pure and compact manner. The most significant point is that the audience is transparently given each character's consistent personality from beginning to end, and their full and lively expression. We don't need to elaborate, this is his immortal characteristic in the world of playwriting. I believe that he is a theatrical talent made for the stage, and these advantages cannot be compared to those of purely literary figures such as Maeterlinck and Shaw.</p>
<p>From his strengths, I also think of the strengths of China's Water Margin. The 108 heroes of Liangshan in Water Margin each have their own tone. When you see whose words, you know they came from whose mouth. Ostrovsky's script is also like this. Each character appears in the needs of the story and the ideals of the audience, and skillfully uses each person's personality to deal with the environment of the play. There is absolutely no misplaced, unsuitable consciousness casually placed on someone's body. For example, He Lijia and Guo Ping in "Poverty is Not a Crime" are two obvious examples: He Lijia: "I will never let myself be insulted for no reason. You will come and kneel in front of me, asking me to marry your daughter, yes, ha ha ha, you will do this, I know you, you just want a good wedding ceremony, to scare the villagers, you would even be willing to hang yourself, but, no one wants her, how unfortunate ah! Haha!" Guo Ping: "How should I support myself in the big snowstorm?" and "Make way! Guo Ping is gone!"</p>
<p>Ostrovsky has indeed described the characters to a deeply penetrating level.</p>
<p>The entire play of "Poverty is Not a Crime" is also so fittingly portrayed, such as the delicacy of the young people's emotional impulses in the first act, Guo Tai's pursuit of capitalist life in the second and third acts, and the suffering of Mi Diya, Guo's wife, and Guo Yena under the heavy pressure of the feudal system, completely revealing the sins of Russian hypocrisy. (China's current society seems to be like this). Ah, what's more, Ostrovsky is not an artist-for-art's-sake advocate, how should we better determine his value? In China, this decision to perform "Poverty is Not a Crime" by this valuable talent is the first introduction. We feel how appropriate and glorious it is!</p>

<h3 id="e233">The Peach Flood is Pressing <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoshan</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Misfortunes never come singly." China has suffered from the ravages of civil war for years, and is subjected to the oppression of the great powers. The people's livelihood and economy have reached the end of their rope. We can see that the rural and urban economies are bankrupt, and unemployment and hunger are everywhere. Now, floods and droughts are coming even more urgently.</p>
<p>This is a problem worthy of our attention. In the past, the Yellow River flood affected several provinces in the Northwest and North, leaving devastation everywhere. Now, the water level of the Yellow River has risen again. No matter how hard the River Management Committee tries to find ways to rescue the situation, the dam is in a precarious state. What we see is only a palliative method; there is still no fundamental solution. The masses are presented with this "sticking to the old methods" of river management policy, and they have no hope at all. The masses can only wait to die.</p>
<p>In the Yangtze River, we feel the crisis even more. Last year's floods in Hubei and other places caused us immense pain. Let's take a look at the figures: the affected area was 44,870,000 square kilometers, the affected farmland was 70,273,159 mu, the affected population was 7,149,712, the loss of grain was worth 9,063,000 yuan, and the value of cotton was 50,122,200 yuan. This figure is for Hubei Province alone. If we talk about other related provinces, the numbers are truly unimaginable. However, the Yangtze River—especially Hubei Province—is now facing the peach flood again. And it is coming very urgently. We remember that last year, the dike defense work in Hankou, Wuchang, and Hanyang took months of effort, but still could not withstand the flood. This year, the peach flood presents the same crisis. News from Hankou in recent days indicates that the water level is rising, with the water mark recorded above 8.3 meters. From this, it can be seen that last year's flood is likely to occur again.</p>
<p>However, countless people on the brink of death hope that the authorities will not always use the old methods to deal with the situation, but should consider a comprehensive transformation. And for the current transitional dike defense work, it is hoped that special attention will be paid!</p>
<h3 id="e234">The Failure of a Person <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Shuman</p>
<p>It's early spring: the sun leisurely spreads over the loose soil in the village that has been ploughed, allowing the crows to jump freely inside, allowing the children to shout and play inside, and allowing the white-haired old people to be lost in thought, reminiscing about the old days: those tears, those laughter, those hardships and difficulties...</p>
<p>The old people have that kind of eccentricity, that kind of habit: in the sunlight, in the afternoon of rainy weather, at dawn and dusk, in midnight dreams, they repeatedly and constantly turn the pages of the book of past life—reminiscing about it, imagining it, chewing on it, like a gluttonous child, greedily swallowing the past life!</p>
<p>"The past has been so long..." A sigh startled the crows resting in the sunlight, causing them to scatter and fly away. Fifth Uncle thought again about those incomprehensible things that seemed dizzying to him—that fate, that life—came: "I am a dying man, fate has hated me all my life, and life is still so difficult..."</p>
<p>"Life is still so difficult," that is indeed true. For example, two years ago, Fifth Uncle was still a rent collector. Although his hair was white and his ears were a little deaf, he relied on his "old age" and the many people he knew, running errands in this small village in the spring and autumn, and life passed by bitterly. "Fate is always against him," as he firmly believed: "Good days will not come. Life is hard, luck is bad, what can be done?"</p>
<p>"Fate!" For this sixty-year-old Fifth Uncle, it has always been a mysterious, great, and incomprehensible thing. He trusted fate all his life, but fate has always been so cruel to him: "Life is hard, there is no way!"</p>
<p>In this "life is hard, there is no way," his dark life crawled slowly like an ox. He believed in fate, he feared hard work, and he retreated from the world from the beginning. When he was young, he did not dare to use his strength to fight for the village girl he loved to be his wife. "Marriage is also destined," so he willingly let his parents arrange a confused marriage for him. At that time, Fifth Uncle had cried twice at night, but later, he quickly forgot everything, because: that was also "fate," people cannot fight against fate—there is no way. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Completion of National Defense Films <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Xinxin</p>
<p>Yesterday, the officials of the Central Propaganda Department summoned the responsible personnel of the Shanghai film industry and held the third discussion meeting in the municipal government. The atmosphere of the meeting was very serious and enthusiastic. The conversation between the host and guests was very close and sincere, making the spirit of sincere cooperation invisibly revealed in the meeting place. For the sake of the future of Chinese films, this is naturally very gratifying.</p>
<p>Reading today's (21st) newspaper, I know that "Regarding the central style of domestic films in the future, the three principles are determined as follows:　Promote national consciousness to fulfill the mission of national defense films;　Carefully select film subjects suitable for the times to promote the effect of film education during national crisis;　The realistic depiction of film plots should fully assist in the advancement of the New Life Movement."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the national crisis, progressive and conscientious artists, although in extremely difficult circumstances, have been producing under the goal of "promoting national consciousness to fulfill the mission of national defense films." This is an obvious fact; however, it is regrettable that only a few progressive and conscientious artists are working hard under this goal, while those film producers who are bewitched by the "ice cream theory" are desperately working on the so-called "business vision." Although, in the end, the so-called films full of "business vision" are still not seen to have "business."</p>
<p>Now that the film discussion meeting has such three principles, that is naturally very good. At least, let those "ice cream theorists" also know how much the Central Propaganda Department pays attention to the "effect of film education during national crisis," and how urgently it hopes that the film industry will jointly shoulder the responsibility of "promoting national consciousness to fulfill the mission of national defense films"! At the same time, it also proves how much the responsible personnel of the Shanghai film industry hope that their screenwriters, directors, and other staff will "fulfill the mission of national defense films."</p>
<p>Originally, in today's situation where the national crisis is deepening day by day, the urgent need for "national defense films" has become an indisputable fact, so how should we further complete it?</p>
<p>Speaking of "national defense films," some people will definitely bring up the tail of the Bright Volunteer Army as an excuse for opposition, thinking that "national defense films" are limited to this. So it is summarized into the conclusion that our "national defense films" already exist, but their effect is still not seen, which shows that "national defense films" do not exist. -- Or, use the same reasons for opposing "national defense literature" to oppose "national defense films."</p>
<p>Using the tail of the Bright Volunteer Army to criticize the existence of "national defense films" is obviously a "desperate doctor seeking random treatment" argument. It is certainly ridiculous to formulaically insert a tail of the Volunteer Army, and it is certainly not understanding the diversity of artistic works in terms of content and formal techniques. However, it is not tenable to insist on grasping this weakness as a reason for the non-existence of "national defense films."</p>
<p>And a progressive artist? He will not cling to one subject matter, he understands that under the principle of fighting for national survival, art can correctly reflect this goal. I think this also does not need much explanation from us.</p>
<p>At the discussion meeting, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian raised the issue of "the review of scripts, hoping that the central government has a review scope and writing principles so that screenwriters have something to follow." I think this can also become a problem for the central government to promote the completion of "national defense films." Aren't the three "principles" decided at the discussion meeting just the "principles" to be used as the scope of review and writing?</p>
<p>From this discussion meeting, we not only see the urgent need for "national defense films," but also can see that the central government and the responsible personnel of the film industry both want to "fulfill the mission of national defense films." In addition to hoping that "national defense films" will not become a decoration of this discussion meeting and become "empty talk," we also hope that the central government can handle the script and film review of "national defense films" as quickly and broadly as possible, and also has a way to remedy the double inspection of foreign films!</p>
<p>Except for "ice cream theorists" and those who are bewitched by them, I believe that every conscientious artist will focus on the principle of fighting for national survival to move towards our goal.</p>

<p>The bandit suppression is successful and returns in glory. Zhu Chundeng is ordered to return to his hometown. Who knows? He doesn't see his wife's face. He hurriedly asks his aunt for her whereabouts. The wolf-hearted woman is eloquent. She says that the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have gone to the afterlife. Hearing this, he feels as if struck by lightning. He cries his heart out and is filled with hatred. He holds a funeral to help the poor and does good deeds to help the souls of the dead. Who knew? The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are still alive. They have suffered family disasters and fled to the deep mountains. They live with the shepherds and their flocks. They look at their family but dare not return. They endure tears and beg for food. Husband and wife meet at the tomb. Looking at each other's faces, they are surprised. After a thorough questioning, the truth is revealed. Only then did he know that his aunt had lost her conscience, causing his mother to cry bitterly. On the spot, he changed into official robes and bestowed titles. Hardship is over and sweetness comes, and he can finally smile. The evil woman is anxious at this time. She kneels in the center and makes a vow to dispel suspicion. Who would have thought? Before the vow was finished, a blue dragon arrived. In an instant, her bones turned to ashes. One cannot escape the consequences of one's own evil deeds.</p>

<p>Silver silk hangs around the fragrant bed. The young widow skillfully dresses up. Suddenly, she sees a servant arrive. Her eyebrows brighten and her face beams. Madam, let me tell the virtuous young master. I admire Madam's kindness. First, put away the filial veil. Choose an auspicious day for the marriage. Old man, it's better to hit the day than choose it. What's wrong with getting married tonight? I am satisfied to be frivolous early. I will arrange it hastily and enter the bridal chamber. Hurry to the boudoir to put on auspicious clothes. Let this old servant be the master of ceremonies and invite the groom. Bow down to heaven and earth and enter the bridal chamber. Sit shoulder to shoulder and cover your face with a fan. The infatuated Madam Tian steals a glance. She sees him frowning and tears in his eyes. She cries out and falls to the ground. Madam Tian is startled and flustered. Old man, why is your young master like this? Quickly help the young man into bed. The young master has a heart condition. There is no miracle cure in the world. China has a living brain. Taking it can make him healthy. There is no brain juice here. It is inevitable that the scholar will die. Old man, the newly dead can use it. If it can be used, there is still room for discussion. Madam, it can still be used before the seventh day. Taking it can also strengthen him early. Hearing this, Madam Tian split the coffin.</p>

<p>Color film stocks soar instantly. The film is released today at the Grand Theater.</p>
<p>The long-awaited natural color blockbuster, "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine," premiered at the Grand Theater at 9:15 last night. The invention of sound films has already established an immortal miracle in the art of film; and the release of this "The Trail of the Lonesome Pine" will open a new chapter for color films, because this is a natural color film completely shot outdoors, which is different from the dyed films of the past. Other film companies, seeing the success of this experiment, are preparing to shoot important films in color for release. And the colorful film stocks on the New York Stock Exchange soared instantly. The success of this film can be proved by this. Moreover, according to foreign newspaper reviews, this film, even if it is not in color, is a miracle on the screen, because the story is sad and beautiful, and the performances of Sylvia Sidney and others have also achieved great success.</p>
<h3 id="e242">United China Film Company News <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>The first sound and dialogue film of the United China Film Company, "Waves Washing Sand", which is about to be released, was screened privately at the Carlton Grand Theater on the evening of the 16th. Because this film is also a work that is highly valued by colleagues, all the actors of the United China Film Company were present that night.</p>
<p>The special work of the United China Film Company, "The Prodigal Lamb", is currently being dubbed by Mr. Ren Guang and Ms. An E.</p>
<p>Sun Yu's work "The Road" contains a new Fengyang song, and the recent work "Go to Nature" also has an old Fengyang song, but although the song is old, the singing method is very novel and unique, which can be called old songs sung in a new way.</p>
<p>The underwater photography of "Waves Washing Sand" used as much as 180 yuan of water.</p>
<p>"Song of the Loving Mother" is a moral film with the highest meaning of Chen after "Tianlun", which can be used as a mirror for modern families.</p>
<p>During the filming of the deserted island log cabin for "Go to Nature" a few days ago, Han Langen and Zhang Zhizhi performed a nude dance, causing all the staff to laugh.</p>
<p>Fei Mu's new work can start shooting in mid-May. The script is written by Fei Mu and Shen Futai, and the actors have been internally decided.</p>
<p>After "Waves Washing Sand", Wu Yonggang's new work is titled "Swallows Fly Together". The leading actors are Jin Yan and Chen Yanyan.</p>
<p>Han Langen plays a mute in Fei Mu's new film.</p>
<p>"The Prodigal Lamb" contains the Great Wall.</p>
<p>In addition to directing "Crying Remnant Red", Wang Jielong will star in a film for the United China Film Company.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhi was not originally among the actors of "Song of the Loving Mother", but now Zhang has been specially added to the lineup.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan's recent work "Crying Remnant Red" and "Swallows Fly Together", which she will co-star with Jin Yan, are both sound films. These two films can be completed by the second half of this year.</p>
<p>Tan Youliu's new work will start shooting in mid-next month. It is said that this film is set against the backdrop of an amusement park of a large company.</p>
<p>The news film department of the United China Film Company recently sent a photographer to capture "Huangshan Scenery", which will be released with "Waves Washing Sand".</p>
<p>Zong You plays the poet Niu Ziran in "Go to Nature", with long hair and a dignified appearance. Later, when he drifted to the deserted island, his hair and beard were shaved, and he covered himself with animal skins, just like an African native.</p>
<p>After the marriage of Liu Qiong and Ms. Yan Fei, Tan Youliu and Ms. Huang Shuzhen announced their marriage on the 12th at the Nanjing Hotel. After Tan and Huang, there will be a wedding banquet for set designer Zhang Hanchen in a few days.</p>
<p>Yan Renying, the famous Tianjin sea monster, has recently been appointed as the sports editor of the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao. Yan and Jin Yan were classmates in Nankai in the old days. They came to the headquarters to visit the filming of "Go to Nature" a few days ago, and Jin Yan and others laughed and talked strangely.</p>
<p>The United China Film Company's basketball team recently played basketball against the Water Company and won with a score of 68 to 35. The game against the freshman team of Jiaotong University ended in a tie with a score of 36 to 36. In the football game, they lost to the China Aviation Company football team with a score of 3 to 1. In the basketball game against the National Sports Team, the score was 103 to 77, breaking the world's worst defeat record.</p>
