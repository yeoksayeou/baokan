<p>自二中全會决議撤消西南兩機關。並以余漢謀為粤省綏靖主任。負整理全省軍事之責。消息騰布以後。西南方面卽準備由留粤各中委召開非常會議。以示與二中全會相對抗。同時陳濟棠李宗仁並着手組織救國聯軍。分就正副司令。復極意慫恿蔣光鼐蔡廷鍇等加入合作。甫就消弭之危機。顯有復燃之可能。當時人心之緊張。蓋可想見。其後韶關方面。一再傳已接觸。而桂軍之分批開粤。亦益見兵事之終難倖免。曾幾何時。局勢驟變。粵軍將士旣不欲操同室之戈。航空人員亦復全體歸順中央。遂令孤掌難鳴之陳濟棠。不得不於徘徊咨嗟聲中。戢翼鎩羽以走港。而一時劍拔弩張之局面。倏焉如風雲噓散。歸於杳渺。此誠非吾人始料所及。要亦舉國股願之克相感孚歟。</p>
<p>基於此次粤變之經過。吾人可得兩重感想。第一。處今日情勢之下。和平統一實為上下一致之要求。任何懷抱野心者不能違反此鐵般之原則。故中央雖欲保持威信。不能不走政治解决之途徑。而粤方亦唯有藉對外名義以洩憤。始終未聞兩粤對中央有公然指斥之言詞。中央對兩粤下明白討伐之命令也。卽在最後數幕。蔣陳間之西電往復。亦儘採委宛之態度。保私誼於勿淪。所謂絕交不出惡聲。乃得於今回行動覘之。此可證明各方懍於國難之深刻。尊重團結之意旨。均在竭力避免鬩牆之口實。第二。一向頭腦簡單之軍人。今日已知以捍衛邦國為前提。而服從長官有限度。悟本身為國家之干城。非私人之爪牙。故在消弭內亂之必要立塲上。不憚以釜底抽薪之辦法。師迴矛倒戟之故智。由此可令一般軍人獲得一種急遽之認識。凡直屬長官一有驅戰之命令。果其動機為出於捍禦外侮。自當赴湯蹈火。恪盡天職。反之。其目的只在攘奪權利。便應止殘去殺。靜候覺悟。誠使每一軍人。均能根據靖亂之觀念。激發衛國之精神。則今後內戰之機緣。自可根絕於無形。</p>
<p>乃者入粤桂軍。旣已自動返旆。而負責整理軍事之余漢謀。亦復遄稈返省。留粤將頒如繆培南張達輩。並已分別與余漢謀商洽接收事項。預計粤局奠定之期。當不在遠。中央且已决定乘此時機。澈底整理粤省財政。由財部派宋子良為廣東財政特派員。唐海安代兩廣鹽運使。並將由財次鄒琳躬自入粤視察。以便劃分稅收。統一幣制。則是此次事變之結果。匪特恢復異動前之狀態。且能進一步。並夙昔貌合神離之局面。亦已盡撤其藩籬。而歸於胹合。吾人旣幸隱憂之消釋。復覩統一之形成。今後睽睽屬目之點。唯在於國防會議之如何展開矣。</p>

<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>廣田首相，對這「歷史的演詞」的答辯，是「確立憲政」，而寺內陸相呢？他公吿齋藤：「對於論旨，有同感。此後現役軍人參政，經不肖之身行之。」一般人們，以為齋藤的演說，僅僅是口頭上的勝利，這頗有誤解，廣田內閣的任務，不是採用高壓的手段去制伏軍部，而使軍部稍微走上正軌的力量那却是有的。因為，他的政權，是過渡的。在過渡期中，他鎭壓左傾也糾正右傾。從史的發說來軍部的抬頭，决不是荒木男爵和眞崎大將的個人意志，乃，擁有不可忽視的潮流是在他的背後，這就是承若槻內閣之後日本資本主義的危機，和軟弱的外交。目前，少壯軍人所認為奇恥大辱的倫敦條約，成為廢紙，所抱的大陸政策，逐一完成；而且對華意料之外的勝利，滿洲的開發，非獨暫時地緩和了日本資本主義的危機，而且連素來不滿於政權的小資產階級，對急進法西斯，也失去了贊助的熱忱。除非無產階級的運動，刺激着牠；除非廣田內閣所站立的平衡點破壞，急進法西斯目前的登臺，是非常困難。也為着上述原因，廣田內閣時代的軍部，取着寺內型，而不是荒木型。在荒木大將不可一世的當兒，「五·一五」的行動者，豈但逍遙法外，還載着愛護皇國的榮冠；寺內大將的執權，「二·二六」的政變者，不獨受重刑的處分，尙在額頭刻着無復以加之叛徒的罪名。這些的區別，可由齋藤演說的翌日（五·九），軍法會議當局，宣吿相澤中佐的死刑，得着證明。這時候為相澤辯護的滿井，被黜為參謀本部員，鵜澤博士，則早已消聲匿跡。</p>
<p>軍部的暫時退却，也就是政黨某一部份集團的歿落。這裏我們應該為讀者指出久原房之助。這位田中義一大將的股肱，日本產業財閥的政治家，是齋藤隆夫所謂與軍部相結托的人物。他在政變之前，一舉手之勞，從股票中獲得了三百萬元的大金，政變之後，忽然報紙和刊物，稱為「行方不明」。一個鼎鼎大名的急進法西斯的政治家，會「行方不明」，這在「支那匪國」（大谷光瑞對於我國的形容詞）裏，或有可說，而在自稱為東亞文明擁護者的國家，那簡直要成為不可思議了。但是，上海日日新聞，在當時，曾登過一段消息，就是久原係與七十餘名的賄選議員同時入獄。如果僅為着這個芝麻似的事情，陷於縲絏之中，决不會「行方不明」的。而且「再起大概不可能」的情况，可料想是非常重大的。他的歿落，在政友會中失去一位善於搗蛋的督軍；在政治舞臺上，缺少了時與荒木們興波作浪的健將。然而道只能算做「國體明徵派」的歿洛，而不能認為是他所代表之財閥的覆亡。就不說久原所有的股票全部由野村財閥承擔，而鮎川義介所統治的日產，賴着軍部「汽車國策」等的贊助，還是欣欣向榮。這究為何故呢？原來久原的活動，除代日產財閥謀利益外，另參雜了個人的動機，他要推翻鈴木總裁，不惜在政友會中，弄成黨內有派；他要勾結荒木，起而奪取政權，遂高揭反重臣集團的旗幟，甚至他尙以「立憲政治家」的身分，和直接行動的少壯軍人携手；這些是個人行為，和日產沒有多大的關係。但從另一角度看來，日產財閥，軍需工業的發展，不能缺乏軍部，而負溝通責任的，就是久原們。現在，久原由僩人的動機和行為而歿落，日產財閥的軍需工業，為適合現階段日本資本主義的需要，還是擴大下去。</p>

<p>（倫敦）上議院今日辯論華北走私局勢、反對黨領袖馬萊勳爵曾評詆上海英商之態度、謂彼等不能將非法不公允競爭使英國在華貿易為之低落一事、悉歸咎於日人、上海英商亦須稍負其咎、此項困難、或可由國聯解决之、如日本對華侵略繼續不已、中國必將依賴俄國之友誼、以抵抗日本、馬萊繼引述上海字林西報近載諷刺畫、上繪中國正在接通東京與柏林間之電話、上海地方人土以為日人佔據工部局、乃一尋常事、英人亦多以為然云、</p>
<p>今日之辯論、乃由前印度事務大臣皮爾勳爵開始、據稱、華北局勢現需常加注意、繼乃詳述該處走私事、謂近嘗運到子彈與軍械兩批、而販賣毒藥者、當然乘此機會、以毒藥傾入中國、此項物品、日本製造者佔數甚巨、今可隨意運輸、其影響中國財政之處不難預料、當知此不特擾亂中國之貿易、更將妨害以關稅為抵之中國外債、中國整個行政制度與中國之貨幣、將受何種不利之影饗、此大可想見者也、已往十週中、英美駐日大使屢請日政府遏止華北走私、日政府殊少或絕不注意及之、日人今以猜疑經濟壓迫及與世界隔離而孤立之一般情戚為根據、日人因英人之利益、妨害其自己利益、似圖與之爭鬭、惟邇來亦有許多日人有所感覺、欲與英國獲一般諒解、</p>

<p>— 本報特派記者石英</p>
<p>衢縣、是浙東山地區昆鄰閩贛皖的一個要地、它在浙東的形勢、略與金華麗水成犄角、金華麗水、本來也是浙東的要地、但不若衢縣的含有省際重要性、將來京衢鐵路築成、與浙贛路相會於此、遙望南京上海、這裏恰占在一個狹長等邊三角形的頂點、形勢將愈增重要、這是可用直覺想像得到的、</p>
<p>該縣舊稱衢州府治、又因閩贛皖三省大道、集中衢縣、故別稱三衢、轄江山常山等五縣、今設專員公署兼保安司令部、轄境且較前增兩縣、清初、大軍克衢州、八閩以次而下、後三藩告變、總督李之芳、趕快跑來守住此城、耿精忠卒不得逞、洪楊之亂、左宗棠徵調各省軍、也以這裏做進攻洪楊的根據地、民國二十二年閩變之役、因杭江路星夜展築、通車江山、形勢雖略有轉移、但衢縣地勢關贖、通車較早、在軍需上、預作充分的準備、也無異替前方將士聲勢、打了不少的氣、</p>
<p>衢縣的城、是唐御遲敬德監造的、三面環水、一面靠山、城裏有很多水田、洪楊亂時、被圍三年、百姓種地、接濟軍糧、卒未失陷、以故有「鐵衢州」這稱、但城並不很高、當此立體戰爭的時代、舊時金城湯池、多已不足為恃了、駐軍十八軍司令部、適應時世的需要、除軍工修築馬路、新開城門、並積極提倡民眾衛生外、最近還熱熱烈烈的舉行過一次防空演習、借用提燈游藝大會的號召、連鄉下人都被轟引來看個底細、此在浙東山地區各縣、恐怕還是極有意義的創舉的吧、</p>
<p>十八軍軍長羅卓英氏、勇戰善謀、向為一般高級宿將所器重、至譽為後起之秀、記者承老友現任該司令部中校秘書楊幸之兄的引見、得閒羅氏關於對外勦匪、兩廣異動諸問題、滔滔暢談一點多鍾的寵論、殊為欽佩、茲擇其可述者、約略述之、羅氏認為對外方面、這一拳不打去則已、打去必定要有把握、有力量、連年勦匪、損减國家力量、誠一大憾事、並以該軍調駐浙東為喻、任傷本不在清勦殘匪、然忽忽一年中、所屬部隊、蓋亦很少與清勦工作、實際絕緣、這雖不無小牽制、但對於主要任務、還依然一點一滴的埋頭準備着此次兩廣異動、倘在二中全會、不能以政治手段解决、中央為貫澈統一計、戡亂止叛、恐不免耳、言下不勝慷慨唏噓之至、嗣為秘書處長荘明遠氏招飲、邀朱參謀處長毓林等作陪、供給材料甚多、盛意良可感也、後記者離開衢縣、聞該軍旋亦出調贛南、翹首嶺南風雲、日益黯淡、願以誠意、寄語雙方將士、此次倘不能化干戈為玉帛、不得已弟兄蕭牆相見、能少打一粒子彈便少打一粒、能保存一分元氣便保存一分、因為雙方的這兩筆大開　銷、並非慷他人之慨可比、結果都要記在一家人的總賬上、須緊防清理破產之末日光臨呀、</p>
<p>衢縣人口總數、約三十萬左右、內江山幫及江西幫、幾乎各占三分之一、耕地因各七十二溝的水利、並有高地與低田的調劑、縱遇旱澇荒年、也不過小災而已、業權當年全屬於土著人、因好吃懶做、僱用外籍人為佃戶、他們勤儉勞作、積至多年、於是地主手裏的業權、多已轉移於佃戶之手、而隱然成為耕者有其田、目前因錢糧附加太重、並實行二五减租、田地價格跌落、極少買賣成交、惟二五减租、曾鎮壓一部份貧農之崩潰、雖不不利於地主、然完不失其為善政、物產以米糧紙張為大宗、柴炭大紅橋木材等次之、</p>
<p>有地名「十里荒山」者、浙建廳會墾地一萬畝、植油桐一百三十餘萬株、由區公署接辦管理、俟三年後出油、年可得利六七十萬元、真是一大利源、聞現在每月須四百元的管理費、很難籌措、想把各縣囚犯、提去做種地工作、因為他們請不到保人、又難實現、殊為可惜、可是天下事、絕不能盡利而無幣、囚犯墾殖、利大弊小、何必拘拘乎要保、何况植桐成利、給他們一些好處、囚犯非頑石、焉有不彼感格之理、事實上果不免有疎虞之處、為了成全植桐的大計、讓幾個幸運的囚犯、漏網只當大赦、也是值得的、</p>
<p>附近各縣匪患、不曾澈底肅清、有三五成羣的、也有數十人一股的、狼奔豕突、流竄無定、大軍進剿、却無顯著的目標、兼不通匪、便暗中怕匪、至少也不敢得罪匪、甚至連保甲長都不敢當、官軍欲想他通報匪情、好像從猴猻口裏奪胡桃一樣的難、匪之綁架富人、襲擊團隊、事先無臭無聲、無蹤無影、暗號一聲暴發、往往匪民莫辨、敵我不分、倉猝不知所措、本月八日清晨、開化縣城、還一度突破四百餘匪攻陷、事先亦毫無線索可尋、故目前清剿工作、政治更比軍事要緊、卽施行所謂「九分政治、一分軍事」、積極從事組織保甲、訓練壯丁、推行積谷各事、特別積谷一項、當新收糧價遺跌落、農民可向積谷倉抵押借欵、俟糧漲時另行作、對農村經濟大有調劑之益、而國防食糧、也可預作充分的準備、故推行頗力、成績較著、可知目的又僅限於清勦殘匪的一方面了、</p>
<p>衢縣城中、有孔氏南宗奉祀官府、內供孔子及夫人兀官氏像傳係子貢用楷木手刻、宋南渡時、由衍聖公孔端友抱負來衢、珍藏至今、記者投刺參觀、二像各高尺餘、並排端坐、孔子朝股執圭、顏色蒼黑、刻劃遒勁、扣之作金石聲、大約已成為楷化石了、現在這位奉祀官、還大北宗孔德成一代、曾入日本士官學校、縱情嫖賭、為族人所不滿奉祀官原定應由政府、月支薪四百元、但迄今兩三年、連銅元都不曾收到一枚、</p>
<p>記者在衢所宿鉅章旅館見壁間縣有幾幅蒼老清逸的畫圖、看署名是錧主汪氏的指筆指頭也好畫畫、雖聽過、却不曾見過、好在這位老指畫家、過去他是同業中人、十數年前、在上海辦小報、他說那時日報公會、卽附設申報館、他常到那裏去過、此時去看他、一見面就好像熟人、此老旣知記者來意、就舒開一張宣紙、用中指醮墨、很快的畫送我一圖雪松、而且畫成時、就讀之相映成趣、據稱、畫指畫、貴用奇筆險筆、且用生紙（無　性者、）畫成、始歷久不變、清初大學士高其佩（號且圓）均能之、故為指畫家所師法、然能用生紙者則甚少、而落墨清俗亦各不同、記者嘗試畫幾筆、指禿苦不能削尖、中實又無法灌墨、善指畫者、濃淡向背、獨能得心應手、可謂藝林中的另一絕技、</p>

<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>提倡國貨推廣國貨，最要緊的辦法，莫如促進一般人的購買力，而所以促進購買力的原動，允在於一般人具有消費的力量。怎樣使人人有消費的力量，便是養成人人有生產力。</p>
<p>目下生活在水準以下以人，都沒有消費力量，怎樣可以有購買力？吾推究原因，便是內地農村破產，工商不發達，人人沒有生產力量。</p>
<p>因為沒有生產力，所以無論衣食住行，只好將就一下，那裏有力量來供給消費。便是無論貨物怎樣優良，怎樣適用，更那裏有力量來購買？消費力薄弱，購買力愈衰退，而生產的東西，更沒有出路，因果相生，彷彿是含有循環性的。所以要使人人有消費力，有購買力，便是怎樣鼓起內地一般人的生產力。</p>
<p>最近國民經濟運動，注意提倡國貨，尤其注意提倡內地的種種副業。這便是促進生產力的最好方法。農人一年實際耕種時間，不到二分之一，還有二分之一，便是利用來發展副業，使人人的生產力加增，則購買力量，當然增進。這是提倡國貨的先决問題，很値得注意的。</p>
<h3 id="c142">望學生們努力暑期國貨工作 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>讀上期本刊仰堯先一一文後，我覺得非常地生「暑期學生國貨運動」感動，的確，在這國難日念，特別是走私嚴重，把國民經濟的危機，使整個的產業界，一天天走上總崩潰的時候，我們對全國學生們，提出利用著假，努力國貨運動的建議，自是萬分地迫切和重要。同時，我想全國各地的學生們，在這非常時期的現下，也一定不願把大好的光陰，讓它白白地逝去，而要趁這時機，做些很有意義和價値的事情。那末。對於這救國的基本工作——國貨運動，當然一定會義不容辭地幹去，而去努力進行的。</p>
<p>最近，上海國貨運動聯合會，就在上星期招待敎育界和新聞界，商討暑期學生國貨工作的實施、並成立了一個暑期學生勸用國貨會，通過章則及工作綱要。這是自一個値得大家欣喜的消息，我們希望全國各地大·中·小學的敎師們，學生們，都立刻來響應它，擴大它。而每個學生回到各該家鄉的，尤其要注意能適應每個地方環境的需要，分別做去。在下面，我還要寫出幾點，自己認為工作中最重要的，列在下面，以供參考：</p>
<p>一。在本鄉努力宣傳服用國貨和走私危機，洋貨傾銷的利害，用最警惕的言詞或文字，去勸導全體鄕人，於早晨或晚上，最好能利用鄕人餘暇，在各公共集會處，如茶館，酒店，寺院等，舉行國貨演講</p>
<p>二。在本鄉詳細調查國貨推銷情形，與走私侵害本國工商界情形</p>
<p>三。搜集各種精美國貨出品，在本鄉舉行流動國貨展覽會。</p>
<p>四。往本鄉各販賣商店，勸導店主一律販賣國貨，勿再進洋貨，以應市面。</p>
<p>五。在本鄉調查國貨與洋貨銷路的比較，走私充斥的程度，用數宇統計出來，一方在當地宣示大衆，使知警戒，一方面再作詳細記錄，以便彙集報吿會中。</p>
<p>總之，這樣有意義的救國工作，我們可敬可愛的全國學生們，一定肯會很奮勇地去幹，而使　市民國貨年的前途，放一異彩。</p>
<h3 id="c143">談談宜興的陶器 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 萬乃君</p>
<p>國人對於國產，可以說不論大小，委實是太不愛護！現在指摘出宜興的陶器來談談吧。關於牠的性質，功用，美觀，價値都是合乎經濟原則的。論次述下：</p>
<p>陶器的出品種類頗多，有茶壼，茶杯，茶盆，花瓶瓶，花盆，古瓶，鼎，文具，玩具等等。就是每種品物的色樣大小，至少有二三十種，多則有四五十種。並且品名如茶壼，花瓶鼎，花盆這幾種，就够有意義，大都是具有歷史而評定的。土質黏純而耐用，絕不如外貨之裏外不統一製作而易於破裂。</p>
<p>功用方面，年久卽成古董，且有難於破碎之說。他如茶壺之年久，茶水置於壼中，能够永遠不生異味！花盆有了相當年月，種植花卉易於長大伏盆。餘不勝舉。</p>
<p>顏色有紫，黃，墨綠，紅四種，顏色光澤且鮮明，尤以墨綠為貴，他如特製之碎瓷面茶壼花盆，更為雅觀。無論色樣大小，比擬東西洋貨之陶瓷，却要遠勝</p>
<p>每種品物之價値，雖也有高貴到幾拾元的，當然，這類是屬於名貴的；但是也有一角起碼之價廉且物美者。能够適宜於購買力的强弱</p>
<p>國人們：了解罷。購了外貨不但是失了國民的責任與義務。並且要曉得，自己何苦掏了腰包去給外國烟囱，帶來許多槍砲打我們的祖國呢！不，說是打自己罷。</p>
<p>這裏我勸吿同胞們，樂用國粹陶器，樂用一切所有國產。不致利權外溢；也就是一種美德。</p>
<h3 id="c144">從提倡國貨做起 <a href="#c144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>浪人長期走私！形勢愈趨嚴重！已至有敵無我，有我無敵的地步！讀書生活上某君說得好！不管牠私貨與否？對於劣貨一概抵制！纔是有效辦法！可謂一語中的，愛國者人同此心！心同此理！</p>
<p>吾錫聞人錢孫卿先生，曾作緝私問題的播音演講，題為「關於緝私應有之認識」頗注意於「提倡國貨救國」略謂「緝私責任，非政府所應獨負，走私事件之性質，至為嚴重！關係國家存亡！故凡屬國民，均應共負此責，惟過去任何民衆運動，如抵貨之能，類皆無嚴密組織類出於感情衝動，故不，持久，亦無大效！希望今後國民對於緝私，上下一心，嚴密組織，從提倡國貨做起……」黃炎培先生亦謂「為救國而提倡國貨，非為推銷盈利，而提倡國貨」云云。賢者卓見相同，不佞以為隨時隨地，都應「從提倡國貨做起。」幸勿悔不早用國貨，而噬臍於後也</p>

<p>— 慧健</p>
<p>語云：「百病從口入」，尤其是夏天，許多種流行症大都是由飮食不潔所傳染！所以要特別注意，如像露攤上陳列的瓜菓冰洪淋酸梅湯等，因為有病菌留在上面，都不可吃。</p>
<p>盒裝冰淇淋和瓶裝的汽水是比較淸潔些，但大多數又是外國貨，推銷得多了未免浪擲國幣！</p>
<p>可是在這樣的大熱天，人們不免隨時要進飮料，假使喝了不潔的飮料，就有患霍亂時疫的危險，喝了洋貨汽水鮮橘水，又使利權外溢</p>
<p>要解决這解渴的問題嗎？那麽我就介紹五洲藥房特製的各種新鮮菓子汁，是用上等水菓和蒸溜水做成的，味美可口，止渴生津，經濟衛生一舉兩得，這是値得提倡的國貸飮料。</p>

<p>昨糖市趨勢略平、公會划盤二四粗砂白現貨呌二十二元、轉口貨六元八角、均乏上落、東白四八九號以及本廠綿白、振記金心大華等均呌原價無更動、號盤有廣潮帮開出普通枝洋白數十包、十四元六角半、又華光赤十四元、次十三元八角、成交二百餘包、又惠州赤一百數十包、十三元二角、比前日再升二角、聞汕匯略回、上午電為一千二百二十六元、而前日一千二百元之價、亦係客方約報、實際並未到過二百元云、</p>

<p>威士鐵本埠市甚俏俐、故市塲開出為數頗夥、標準開價因供不敷求節節上升、刻市每箱價三十三元、倘大箱薄貨每箱可開至三十四元五角、查昨市成交有四五百箱之多、惟存底奇薄、故人心良佳、况海外定價昨亦飛漲至八金元、比前提加四金角、是以執貨者心思更高云、</p>

<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>有些好談時局老，嘗把時局比成瘧疾，又從廬疾說到蚊子的遺禍，而主張撲滅蚊子，蓋思過半矣。如今我談蚊子，性質不同。</p>
<p>其實蚊子用螫刺叮人，不統會變瘧疾的。根據病理學的分折，蚊子有兩種，一種是常蚊，西文名Culex，一種是瘧蚊，西文名Anphelex，在我們庸俗的眼光中，原只知嗡嗡而飛者蚊子也，罪大惡極，格殺勿論，决不讓它叮在皮膚上而再加以細細研究。但是洋鬼子既費了工夫認別出來，我們同胞，為着趣味問題，亦不妨樂得現成知道一些。</p>
<p>只要略微留意一下，使可剌別，因為瘧蚊棲壁時，其頭向壁，尾向外，作斜立勢，常蚊棲壁時，卻頭尾直垂，與淺並行．瘧蚊的翅翼有紋，並有斑點，體形自喙至尾，成一直綫。常蚊的翅翼是透明的，有紋而無斑點，體形頭及胸部屈，與腹部作鈍角狀。講到瘧蚊的動止，專在夜裏黑暗中出世，趁人們瞧不見或睡着的時候，以刼掠血液市自肥，其飛甚低，有鬼頭鬼腦之神氣。陰險乖戾，令人可怕，不但劫掠人們的滋養原素，更把一種耀疾原蟲MallaliaePlaxmodium輸送到人體血液中去，破壞血球的組織，正和搗亂份子破壞秩序一樣的可惡。至於常蚊，雖亦吮吸人血，但態度較好，務不歟大禍</p>
<p>假使按罪論刑，我們當然光設瘧蚊。</p>
<p>不過中國同胞，大夥多懷著一種「好生之德」，行路低頭，以免踏死蟲蟻，所以死水中的孑孓、一任共自然生長變化，等到自身被叮痛了，隨手一拍，死，則以為因果還報，不死飛去，則以為蚊也命不該絕、而歐美人士，就有一種固執的成見，主張「殺蚊務盡」，聰明人肚裏想；這還不是「愚公移山」的笨事嗎？</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>在十二個石庫門的一個里弄裏，最是引人注目的，是末一家二上二下的那幢屋子裏所住的大學生家。里弄裏提起了這末一個石庫門，總不說某姓或是某公館，而總是說「大學生家」。</p>
<p>大學生的父親，是一位投機商人。大學生，便是他父親的獨生子。他的父親，做投機買賣連年頗為得手。本來他所住的二上二下屋子中，合住看九家人家，自從四年前買賣得手之後，把共餘八家三房客，都趕掉了，獨家居住着。窮人一旦有了錢，甚麼都是兩樣了，對於鄰居們，都是不怎麼愛理睬了。那時的大學生，才在中學畢業，他的父親反正是有錢，便决心的把他送進了某大學去。鄰居們，見他家，漸和四鄰，斷絕往來了，於是也懶得說某姓家，而遂相率的呼之為「大學生家」。</p>
<p>說起了這個大學生家，也真是夠使其他十一個石庫門中的鄰居們，一半兒羨，一半見妬的。二上二下屋子中，統共不過住看大學生的父母，和大學生本人，但卻用看車夫娘姨大姐等五個人。這些下人們，也是每天吃大魚大肉的。主人吃的甚麼？自然不問可知。總之，生活的優越，是全里弄中，沒有－家想夠得上其－半。</p>
<p>匆匆地過了三年，在某一次投機市塲的天風浪之下，大學生的父親，一博再博，全軍覆沒了不算，更虧負了不少，無法彌補，而破產了，大門上便黏上了址字對條。一家人帶了幾條毛毯，在第八號裏，借了一個亭子樓暫避着。禍不單行，大學生的父親，又氣又急，竟一病不起了。草草成殮之後，母子二人，愁眉相對著，一籌莫展。大學生也沒有從前邪麼的倜儻風流了。住了三個月，大學生因找不到職業，母子二人，孤孤悽悽的回鄕去了。</p>
<p>但是在那弄底的一個石庫門裏，現在雖已由別家居住着，弄裏的人們，還是呼之為「大學生家」。</p>

<p>一個憑人在吃蠅子停留過的食物，別的一個人勸他道：「你不要吃那食物，恐怕它上面已經有了微生蟲菌！」那個愚人卻說道：「你說有微生蟲菌，我的眼睛怎麼沒有看慝」？</p>
<p>以上的故事實在是個笑話，機菌的形態極小，决不是人目所能察見的；祇有在顯微鏡下染色觀之，那才點點曲曲，頓陳眼前。但是正因為牠是自力所能察視的微物，人於是常常在大意中受了牠的毒害。</p>
<p>微菌的種類很多，單就傳染病菌說就有幾十種，如像「結核桿菌」必梁上就是癆病，「餐亂蝶菌」染上就是虎列拉，「腦膜炎重球茵」染上就是腦謨炎，……據衛生工作處調查，但些傳染病菌，每年要殺人幾千萬！</p>
<p>不過傳染的鍋害雖烈，預防的收效也很宏。近年國產的殺菌藥劑，有「亞林自水」「亞林沙而」，（五洲藥房出品，）一種專供澆酒牆邊屋角，肅清微菌積集的地方。一種專供沐浴洗滌，以防菌毒間接的傳染。這也可說是微菌的勁敵啊、</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>再版就再版了，還有什磨感不感呢？</p>
<p>其實卻是無論那一個從事寫作的人所不能不有的！因為我們寫成－本書，眞不管生了一個兒子一樣，而且是父濟母血，一身兼之，更比生兒子要費力得多。待它完成問世，那更他期之彌殷，望之彌切，幸而得邀一部份人的稱賞，居然再版起來，你說，怎能沒有什亦感觸呢？</p>
<p>此番輪到我啦！雖然我的作品巳經再版過的，也還不止這一本御香縹緲錄，但這次的情形是比較有些不同的：第一因為現在市面還在鬧不景氣，出版界尤其悽慘，而「御香縹緲錄」竟能在初版兩個月之後，立卽再版，可說是很難得的事；第二這本書的格局和作派，都很特別，原作甚如此，譯作也是如此，這種特殊的風味，是否適合於現代的一般讀者，起手時候是絕對沒有把握的，如今雖不敢說已經成功，但也未至慘敗，初次嘗試而有此結果，的確有些徼倖。所以當申報經理馬蔭良先生通知我木苦卽刻要再版的時候，我心上眞有些驚嚞交集的情景。</p>
<p>驚的是本書內容實在還算不得怎樣完美，譯筆尤其平凡，要是再無限止的傳佈開去，那眞要弄到「好事不出門？惡事傳千里」了！喜的是這一類性質的小說，我自己固然很愛謫，而別人也未見討厭，正好我還在打算要繼績再介紹一兩部德齡的作品，藉此便增加了幾分勇氣。</p>

<p>唳天先生文席：拜讀來書，母任惶悚。蘭守身如王，素寡交際。雖常讀鴻文，許為當代作者。而瓜李多嫌，未敢引為畏友也况森嚴家節，墨守書風。憂患餘生，徒多難貢之痛。此中曲折，非片紙所能盡。伏維君子自愛，勿陷人於罪惟，幸甚幸甚。柔腸百轉，不稪成文，專此奉答，卽頌文祺。江夢蘭再拜。</p>
<p>在這八行信將中，還有一行多空白，上面贅了一行小字，萬請勿再惠書矣。在猛然一看這信之物，覺得是遭了人家一番拒絕了。（五一）</p>

<h3 id="c203">國際神秘的橫濱 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>從我國到日本，第一個埠頭，不是長崎便是橫濱。我國僑民住在橫濱的最多，所以和我國的關係最深。況且歐美船隻都以橫濱為日本的泊船所，各國人士，凡是路過日本，一定要在橫濱上岸一次，聆略些東洋趣味，因此橫濱自開港以來，便成為國際港灣，直到現在。據說從我國的出使大臣到日本的時候，也帶着護衛侍從，同本國一樣的呼喝開道的前進着，日本人只好趨避散走。和現在的情形，眞有天壤之別了。就是不平等條約，日本也是締結着不少。至今橫濱市內，還有英法諸國的租借地，沒有收回，雖然不像我國的租界，但是也不納租稅的佔據着。</p>
<p>當外國船泊在橫濱靠船的時候，外國人大都要上岸遊覽，購些什物。而附近的日本小販，常運了貨物，在船上兜賣，甲板走廊，便成了他們的臨時商店。貨物以日用品，人造絲綢，玩具為多。市街上的商店，亦以外來顧客為唯一的坐顧，因此橫濱市內的貨物，都由外人的心理而轉變的。最多的是古董店，郵船公司和國際匯兌店。人力車也比東京多，常有外人架起長腿坐在車上遊玩著。他們並非想借此代步，乃是嘗試東洋趣味而已0</p>
<p>橫濱之夜是神秘的，市內有無數的異態旅館，全靠着外人維持的。外人上岸之後，大都不肯回船，便在旅館中住夜，長途旅行者的煩悶，都可以在舞塲和旅館中消去。橫濱市內的娼妓，秘密職業，都是十分發達的。大才營便是舞塲咖啡館和旅館。此種女子都能說得一口流利的外國話，英法德俄各國言語都有。有許多是到過上海巴黎久經風霜的老手，和外國交際，是十分上手的。去年報載東京某大學的外國敎授，在橫濱攝着桃色電影，便楚被洩的一縷春光而已</p>
<p>住留橫濱的外人旣多，國籍人種，複雜異常。不良的外人，更學做着神秘的營業。喜歡神秘的東京人，都乘着汽車電車的趕到那裏去，賭塲，妓院，旅候都比東京强。橫濱好像是另－天地，確是神秘的國際港灣。否則為什麼其他各地沒有的事情，在橫濱都可以公然的呢。最近又發現三個美貌的外人，終日打扮得女子一般的在旋館裏出人，不用說又是桃色事件了。</p>
<p>在橫濱的我國僑民，都是正實的商人。南京街上全是我國的菜館。櫃窗裏滿放着酒壺暖鍋魚翅干貝之類。外國的觀光者和日人都很喜歡的。而雜貨店裏，連我舊式的宮粉和祭祀的錫箔都有，眞是包羅萬象的。此種純潔的商人，不入神秘旋渦，很足令人欽佩。</p>

<p>— 其中</p>
<p>我每次走進浴堂去洗操，擦背者總是抱了十二分的希望跑到我面前來；但因我不需要的緣故，所以終於使他抱了十－一分的失望而退回去。最近，因為不當心，在酒精燈上燙傷了手，、所以走進浴堂裏去，擦背的走來，不使他再失望了。</p>
<p>擦背的一面為我擦背，一面和我搭訕着談話，於是，我也就一詢他們的生活情形了。現在；我把擦背者的一段談話記錄如下·。</p>
<p>「先生：我們這碗飯眞是嘸吃頭。看來為客人擦一次背有、一角錢，其實我們祇能拿四分，還有六分是老闆拿的。浴堂裏擦背的人有十多個，平均每人每天做到十多個生意那就好極了，所以最多一天祇能拿到半元光景。有的人沒有法子，對客人私下說了，呌客人把一角錢直接給擦背的，這種事情被老闆知道了飯碗立刻打破。所以小心的人是不敢的。再有，現在生意，也已大不如昔，最大的原因是按摩院士耳共浴太多了，差不多每條街上都有。他們又為競爭而大喊價，什麼沐浴擦背以及美女什麼祇有五角錢。你想到港堂裏洗操，最講究的也得化上半元錢，．而現在他們也只有半元錢，誰都願意到他們那裏去了！因為一個男人，沒有不喜歡女子在他身上東摸西模的，而我們的生意，也就被按摩院奪完了。唉，現在眞是女人世界，女人處處佔便宜呢！</p>

<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超特撰</p>
<p>淋病是由一種變球菌之肆虐，純係由不潔性交傳染而來。為最頑固之花柳病。故患者每一疏忽，或為庸醫所誤，或為劣藥蒙蔽，則能引起尿道炎，睾丸炎，攝護腺炎，膀胱炎之危險，蓋治療上常識，有非人人所知也。治療之最易敗效者，莫如在爭急性期內，卽施以頓挫療法。急性期雖為病者最痛苦之時期，然亦為病者治療絕好之機會，不宜錯過，此時若治療得宜，卽可脫離苦海，因此時之淋菌尙叢集於尿道前段，不難應用藥力，一綱打盡。惟因市上出售之劣藥，種類過多，致使病者無所適從，且新近又有未經學校畢業之醫師以「最後成功」四字為號召病家之非特異性藥出售，此種藥誤人非淺，蓋余於診病時，每出患者之口述，多為此種劣藥所誤，致病势轉劇，竟有服此爆發併發病者，亦有服此而急性化慢者。近自色素內服劑治淋大吿成功之後，醫藥界所殘留之劣藥，盡在淘汰之例。奸僞之藥商，為欲保持其最後之殘喘，仍拚命鼓吹其效力，企圖作最後之掙扎，醫藥常識薄弱之病家，往往無法鑒別，隨其彀中。吾輩醫師祗可為之補救於事後，如欲防患於未然，須視患者之鑑別力如何為斷耳。</p>
<p>頃近自德國Jadassohn博士悉心研究以色素滲入伐克辛製成之內服劑「安敵淋」問世之後，治淋上遂有一嗚驚人之成功，蓋該藥集有黃色素（Cacridin）誘導體之大成，並含有多量之（Vaccin）菌苗，可增加患者之抵抗力，故結果之佳良，儘合於吾人之理想。作為欲研究其配製之成分，曾集醫界第一流富有多量之（Vaccin），誠為淋病無上對症之良藥，絕無副作用，不損腸冐，並不刺激腎臟而能透膜殺菌，在最短期內將淋菌一鼓蕩平，舉凡慢性淋病，睪丸炎，尿道炎，攝護腺炎，婦人淋病，慢性腎盂炎，均可藉「安敵淋」偉大之藥力，迅速治愈。該藥所含之成分，均由德國Jadassohn博士在實騐室中試騐確效後所配製，無一不有其醫學上之價値，自非仿冒之劣藥所可同日而語，故患者在購服時宜指明眞下「安敵淋」，萬勿為僞藥所誤，以自伊戚也！</p>

<p>不論任何一個壯健的男子，一旦染上手淫惡癖之後，每能積習難戒，久之遺精之症難免，本病之特徵，在夜間入夢能將精液恍惚流出，病象之惡化者，竟無夢亦能滑出，又有在白日稍受色情之感觸與過度愛急操勞之後，也會流出。患者勢必身體虛弱，精神不振，心悸苦悶。頃近接得福煦路姜君之函吿云：余因患劇烈之咯血，致面色枯黄，形容消瘦。后咯血踓多方治癒，然因失血過多致患體虛之症，今春復患遺精，瘦弱愈覺不堪言狀，蒙友介紹至性病專家詹念曾醫師處，承其今服「希答脫氏固精片」不到兩月，遺精完全治癒，當時詹醫師並介紹余向中西藥房購服「生殖素」，以補虛弱之體，刻果見起色，不但意志較前增强，且巳氣血充盈，精神飽滿，此兩藥之神效，誠可復得推崇也云云。</p>

<p>骨節疼痛一症，國人之患之者甚衆，老年人幾並遍罹患。考其骨痛一症，多出風濕內蘊及餘毒未凈而起。更有因梅毒性與淋濁性之關係。如投藥未能兼顧，則根治較難。他若血份不潔，動脈硬化，亦為促成骨痛之主要因素。蓋人之全身動脈，須柔軟而有彈性，如一旦硬化，則易引起全身麻木，關節酸痛，筋絡索疼，四肢拘攣，若不即時治愈，必至猝然倒地，罹患中風症，可使神經及言語中慪失常，甚至半身不遂，亦有因此死亡者，幾為習見之事實。</p>
<p>去冬有謝允平君，來訴有骨節疼楚，手足麻木之苦，且謝君年巳四旬，雖未至暮年，而已感腰駝背曲，步履艱難，據渠云：彼之骨痛病，歷有數年，每於交節氣時，則發作較烈，竟至手足不能高舉，余察得謝君實因餘毒內蘊所致卽以强斯登氏「骨痛片」治之，連服三盒，　不惟毒除瘋去，且骨節輕鬆，筋絡舒暢，雖屆節氣時期，全不感覺若何痛苦矣。</p>
<p>夫婦智識</p>

<p>增進健康……藉以保障伉儷間之幸福基礎　灌智識……以消除兩性間之性機能障碍　澈底研究……如何可使男女间之青春常留</p>
<p>夫婦的基礎，最重要的一件事，便是雙方間身體的健康。雙方有了健康的身體，才可以構成美滿的家庭生活。不然總沒有良好的結果，甚至於弄成惡果。</p>
<p>不論在男方或屬女方，身體上如有發現了缺點，確實是含有重大危險性。現代的夫婦們，應該懇切地把自身來檢查仔細考慮一下。屬於男子者：如性的障碍，神經衰弱症，遺精，早洩，陰萎，不良嗜好，身體衰弱及染有傳染性的花柳病等是。屬於女子者：如月經不調，身弱不孕，及神經衰弱症亦為女子習見之病症，均宜及早治愈。蓋此不但影響伉儷閒之幸福，抑且與本人之生命，發生直接之關係。其次為性的障碍，就不應該結婚。</p>
<p>竟有在結婚前，毫無顯出絲毫之性機能障碍，一旦結婚之後，始會感覺性的不滿。這就是因了遠在結婚前，已經有了性障碍的素質，再因结婚后房事過度，或精神障碍，突然顯現。倘仍悍然不顧，則危險性愈陷深刻。考促成本症之原因，最主要的不外手淫與淋症，致生殖腺遭受摧殘，久之久之，則頭痛，耳鳴，失眠，心悸，等症勢必暴發。而腰酸背痛，精神衰頹，自難避免。同時，腦力，記憶力，記銘力，均感遲鈍。此病之唯一補救，厥為生殖腺素配製而成之「生殖素」良藥，始可使生殖腺加復壯健，並促進新陳代謝之機能，故一切遺精，早洩，陰萎，神經衰弱症，均能藥到病除，而女子方面，宜服女用「生殖素」，以資調整月經，易於生育，且服後女子之臀部及乳房發育美滿，健美畢露，如男女常服，可使疾病不生，保駐靑春，不易衰老，洵為男女間不可多得之滋補聖品也。</p>

<p>— 兪伯符醫師</p>
<p>身體衰弱，煙癮久遠的人們，欲求安全斷癮，確屬是因難萬分。所以戒煙者每有中途復癮，功虧一簣者。惟有「生殖素」以戒除久遠之煙癮，確有特殊之功效，因其具有培補之成分，能繼續不斷的增加全身抗毒之能力，此種偉大的藥力，實所罕有。講參閱下例一位煙癮戒除者的經過情形，便可明瞭其藥力之一斑。</p>
<p>陶家雄浙之杭州人，現年四十有二，彼之吸煙歷史，已有二十年矣，我問實行戒煙之嘗試者，曾有十四次之多，最長之時期為四閱月，然均吿失敗，失敗之原因，因體弱不支，疾病百出，為其主要之原因。近年因年齡關係及煙癮深久之故，故體弱愈增，戒除愈覺心憚意怵，更屬困難矣。今年營菐失敗之後，經濟頓吿拮据，不得不抱破釜沉舟之决心，拚命戒除，用培補戒煙之方法，服「生殖素」矢志不移，先前之兩星期，祗覺煙量渐少，然精神並不衰弱，再兩星期，覺見煙自厭，由每日四次，减至兩次，兩月未到，逐漸减至斷絕，其中经經過亳無痛苦，不過起先略為感覺不自然而已，故同時注射「育維賜保命」數次，卒至克竣全功，現陶君已有半年未吸鴉片，身體胖壯，精神振作，食量亦加，體重菐由九十磅增至一百十九磅矣。「生殖素」培補戒煙之功效有如是者。</p>

<p>當病家經著名醫師或經騐至友介紹指購名藥時，每有不肖之陡，竭力慫恿其改購他種次藥。詐稱可以代替名藥。以售其中飽及混朦之欺。此中必有黑幕，姑不揭破，但請病家加以注意。購時旣當堅决指索，絕對抱定宗旨，弗被誘惑，則黑幕雖險，何致入彀。否則藥物關係健康與生命，耗金錢，誤療期，其提失輕重要非明眼而後知也。</p>

<h3 id="c213">日軍演習與通令讀經 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 翔</p>
<p>在十九日申報上，同在一個地方，登載着以下兩則交相輝映的的新聞：一則是報告天津日軍，於十九日起，又在南大寺作大規模演習五天，「日軍騎兵百六十名，砲四門，馬百六十匹，專車開南大寺，九時復有步兵百八十名，搭四十一次快車，携機關槍六挺，載重軍用車三輛，亦開南大寺」。一則是報告：「冀政會通令冀察平津兩省市，轉令各中小學增設讀經」，聞於下學期開學卽行增設。這兩條新聞同時登在一起，其實是再妙不過的一幅諷刺畫面。</p>
<p>關於「讀經」，在國內鬧了已很久。過去平津正吃緊時，我們曾從報上看到，冀政會通令平津各機關公務員，於辦公時間之外，應一律研讀「四書五經」。這一件故事，它包涵着什麽一種意義，這已不必再為解說，眞所謂「司馬昭之心，路人皆知」。此刻冀政會又來幹這一件「風雅」事了。我們看了，眞覺太使人神經上戚到一種異樣的刺激。</p>
<p>同時在一個地方，一邊是坦克車大砲，在我們的土地上大規模作軍事演習、，而一方太「好整以暇」的人，却在靜氣凝神，曼聲朗誦其「詩云子曰」，這未免是古往今來少見的滑稽喜劇，但也正是一幕太可傷心的悲劇。不久以前，在華北担任着重要任務的蕭振瀛氏，曾為共父作大規模的慶壽，車水馬龍，為「北京政府」以後第一次盛會。一時平津商市，頓形熱鬧，到處是「昇平氣象」，只覺天下太平。古詩有謂「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花一，正可與那時情况後先媲美。現在冀政會通令平津學校讀經，和這事正是一脈相承。我們委實不能不感謝蕭振瀛等一輩人，對於怎樣使平津人民可以忘記了此刻切身受到的最大的痛苦，而安居樂業，他們確實是費了一番甚多的心血的。</p>
<p>然而，眼前的痛苦，雖可竭力使之忘記，但事實最會玩弄人們，它却不時會給你一個更大的刺激。這將如之何？</p>
<h3 id="c214">學校放假了 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>學校放假了。學期試騐已結束。</p>
<p>義務敎員小陳忙得活像不個孫行者，恨不得平空地長出了三頭六臂來。他的責任是敎務處的全權，二百多個學生的積分都要絞他的枯燥了的腦汁，還有學校「三大巨頭」發下來的命令：為保證下學期的學生人數增加起見，趕快辦理一個「學生成續展覽」，和籌備一個「遊藝會」，跟學生家長聯絡聯絡感情情。於是——等因，奉此。我們的小陳先生可更忙得透不過氣來了。他整天地在跳來跳去，從校務處到課堂，又從課堂跳回到他睡覺的地方——說漂亮一點，是：敎員宿舍。那整天看不到太陽，和地牢不相上下的宿舍，翻呀翻的找尋他幾年來經騐纍積下來的參攷品，在凖備着這一切，這一切。</p>
<p>校務室裏變成了一個墟塲鬧市了。學生們的小頭顱儘在起起落落地竄動着，幾十對小眼睛都渴望而且貪餽地死朝着那掛積分簿的地方瞧着，也許在他們和她們的小心靈裏，正在跳動着，焦急而害怕地想在最短的時間知道他的成績——及格，還是不及格。小陳先生的頭有點昏了，眼睛也帶點花，看見這一大堆小頭顱，便像海裏的波濤——不，更切當一點來說，便是他自己常常盼望着的那可以解他的悶渴的小西瓜吧！於是，一個不留神，手和腦袋便不調和起來，算盤上算的珠子已不聽他的調動！錯了。忍着性子，他又得重新趕着。日曆在案頭張開了口嘻皮笑臉地嘲笑他——為了一天兩頓和晚上睏覺的地方便這樣出賣了。——媽的，還不快一點，明天，明天……</p>
<p>「明天？」</p>
<p>他吃了一驚。——明天便是懇親會。下午二時便開會，到那時候他便要把全部積分弄好，而且——遊藝；替學生們預備的唱歌節目；請朋友周來導演的那幕「秋陽」；歌唱表演；化裝演講；雙簧；獨脚戲……還有，那學生的成績；圖畫，勞作，作文，各科的問答卷</p>
<p>他的腦袋混亂起來了。最近，他的神經衰弱症給他帶來了暴燥的脾氣。他也想到了——難道眞的為了一天兩頓，晚上睏覺的地方，便把自己全部時間出賣了嗎？你看——</p>
<p>校長的愛人，中級的級任，臉蛋搽得怪難看，正在那裏伴着琴，唱着——「乖乖，特別…快，呀呀呀呀……」</p>
<p>多肉麻的淫調。還有一羣敎員——都是皇親國戚吧，他們（夾着一個她）在那裏輕聲軟語地開玩笑，打哈哈。他們如果給新派詞人看見了，少不免又要歌頌——「學校事，管他娘！」</p>
<p>至於，校長和那位架子十足的總務主任，那是蠻用勁的，不過他們用勁的地方和小陳不同，他們想盡了方法去籠絡，甚至收買學生，裝煌點綴學校的外表，計劃着——下學期招生四百，每人十二洋，四得四，四二如八，四千八百，那多末寫意。然而——</p>
<p>「我小陳咧，從早上忙到晚上，為的是一天兩頓，晚上睏覺的地方。媽的，操你祖宗十八代的！……」</p>
<p>有時，小陳先生眞的願意放棄了這一切的，雖然生活的惡魔。常常對他扳起了猙獰的臉孔。可是，當他的眼光又落着在這一夥小朋友的蘋菓似的臉孔上時，他的焦急又緩下來了，他的怨恨也都消滅了。他常常對自己說——為了他們，便犧牲了自己吧。</p>
<p>他又提起了勁來算積分了。在他的眼底下溜過了一大堆一大堆蘋菓般的臉孔，他們和她們總算在他和他兩個朋友在這幾個月來的努力下，從那商人的金錢孔裏鑽了出來，又活潑潑地跳着呌着在這大自然的太陽光下了。雖然——他小陳自己，和那兩個朋友終天是過活着在這沒太陽光下的生活。</p>
<p>「陳先生，來！看我們這最後一次練習，看看排得熟練不？」</p>
<p>於是，他又掉下了他的工作來到了圖書室來看他們排戲了。當他看見他們演至父親很沉痛地槍殺他的小漢奸兒子那種嚴肅的塲面時，他也給感動了。他拍着他們的小肩背：</p>
<p>「你們很努力！下學期要周先生多替你們排幾個戲。」</p>
<p>「陳先生，」一個很微弱的細聲低沉地問着小陳先生：「聽說你下學期不在這裏敎書了，是嗎？」</p>
<p>突如其來的問訊，把小陳先生也駭着了，這小風波他自己是曉得的。他眼前黑黑地一大片，他象看見自己幾個月來努力的一點兒成績都變成了肥皂泡，很快地又將給惡劣的環境吹破了時，他落下幾滴淚了。他提起了腿走出圖書室，他聽到了那背後嗡嗡的哭聲了。</p>
<h3 id="c215">荷 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>長久要寫一篇關於蓮花的文章，終於沒有寫出，事先並且把這意思吿訴了一位朋友，所以當他善意的詼諧着說：「荷花快謝了」，我實在說不出的慚愧。</p>
<p>恐怕在一切花卉中我最早看到的是荷花罷。在我們家裏的院子中，不曉得從什麽時候起就能整齊的放着四隻荷花缸，每到夏夫終開着十幾朶花，紅白兼有，雖則疲得很，但是小時候我並沒有看到肥大的荷花，所以總是很歡喜的。</p>
<p>其實荷花並不美，他的唯一的好處是「大」。種在缸裏，零亂槎枒，花葉之間的「章法」實在不好，何况汚泥上面的茂水中更有無數的紅孑孓在那裏游泳呢。但我終於歡喜荷花的原因，說出來當然可笑，不過也沒法，我的歡喜荷花，就因為牠的花瓣可以塗着麵粉油炸着吃；所以院子裏的荷花只要等牠一開，我就馬上人工的把牠零落了。</p>
<p>眞正懂得荷花的好處，是在十六歲的那年。我們學校附近有一個園，園已經快廢了，夏天草長得很高，一進門我們就聽到什麽蟲類在草裏唱歌的聲音，再走幾步，一條很大的池就橫在我們的面前；這池有十多丈闊，長大概有半里罷，所以微風吹來已經很能起些漣漪了。池的兩旁一列種着高柳，別的雜樹一株也沒有，可見主人當時是很不凡的。一條有欄杆的小橋，平平的橫在水面。橋的顏色已經變成灰黑的了，當時我想大概是朱紅的。近橋的池面，是稀疎的浮着幾片槐葉萍，稍遠的所在就有一些荷葉。假使我們再向遠處看過去，那末四分之一里的水面就完全給荷花佔領，那花至少當有兩三千朶以上罷，一例都是粉紅的，陣陣淸芬一陣濃一陣的撲來，使人心魂俱醉，在橋的左近，也有一兩朶孤零的開着，雲影波光益顯牠淸間美麗，這時候我方始懂得「亭亭」兩個字形容荷花的美妙，接着就暑假開始了</p>
<p>秋天了，高柳間的嗚蟬，曳着斷續的殘聲，我帶了舊游的心再去探望這一池荷花，眞是「不到園庭，怎覺秋光如許？」（恕我學一句還魂記杜麗娘小姐的話）一進園門，就覺得高柳濃蔭已經疎得不少，碎石的小徑上，已經問或有了梧桐的落葉，忽忽走上小橋向前望了，當時兩三千朶荷花差不多完全落盡了。在連天的翠蓋中間，只有幾十個蓮房，還帶一二瓣沒有脫下的殘花，但是撩人的輕紅已經變成了可憐的慘白了。這時侯我忽想到南唐中主的「菡蓞香消翠葉殘，四風愁起綠波間」二句詞。微風飄拂一樣是水面漣漪，一個目前還是增嬌助艷，而現在是「着意做成愁」了。王靜安先生解釋這兩句詞是「衆芳蕪穢，美人遲暮」，假使沒有看到這上邊所說</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>的境界是不會知道的。</p>
<p>不看見那池荷已經八九年了，就是不看見院子裏的盆荷也三四年了。院子的盆荷，接到家中的信說早已不開花了，每年只長着幾個瘦小到可憐的葉子，而那個荷池呢，大概也和那個園庭一同荒廢了；只有那幾株柳樹一定長得更高了。</p>
<h3 id="c216">太平捐 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>五月二十，龍王老爺生日，俗例這天演水龍，小街上行人比較平常熱鬧些</p>
<p>三里廟—那個僻靜的鄉鎭。今天，不知是誰攏了頭，鑼聲一早便震醒了人們的淸夢，闔鎭人聲喧囂了，連一隻荒野的狗，也會瘋狂地跳了起來。</p>
<p>鎭西，在龍王廟附近曠塲上，二隻水龍，那麽光輝地排列得嶄齊的，旁邊大羣皮膚赤黑的漢子圍集着，形勢顯得非常緊張和嚴肅。</p>
<p>阿貴是一員中年的武士，高個兒的，他具有天生過人的臂力，仗此在鎭中有了些威名。往年，逢着演龍的時節，他就是充當槍手（一）的，老是一馬當先肩荷着沉重的槍頭，跨起大步子，從這邊到那邊，吹着嘹亮的口嘯，親自統帶那班非常粗魯的人羣，指揮他們動令，正有似臨陣殺敵般的饒勇。</p>
<p>因為這樣獲得了大衆的崇仰，一年一度的太平捐（二），漸漸由他獨掌了。每次，幾十千大錢的油水，儘可不加顧慮的捲進腰包去，就此龍王節他視為一筆專利的買賣似的。</p>
<p>今年呢，阿貴並未棄權，連任發起人。</p>
<p>可是年歲荒蕪了！從淸晨鑼聲嚮，他照例循環提着籐筐挨户去收捐，十家竟九户如此；要費盡千百遍唇舌的翻覆，還不滿足他的慾望呢。</p>
<p>的確年歲愈弄愈糟了！但誰想得到會應饗他所掌握的「太平捐」……？</p>
<p>「阿貴！咱們年常八百八，今年……今年祗有待虧龍王爺爺……五百五……咱們……」那是糟坊裏毛掌櫃當着阿貴的推諉：</p>
<p>「毛大叔！我阿貴脾氣最爽快，喏！七百七……就算給衆兄弟們的份子！」帶着和平的笑臉，阿貴向他爭執着：</p>
<p>「六百六吧……！」</p>
<p>「高升……」</p>
<p>「要待明年了！明年年歲過得好……咱補情……哈，如何！」</p>
<p>阿貴不再要求加，錄入了捐簿，揚個手勢兒便跨進食糧店的門——那是一家更冷落寥靜的舖子。</p>
<p>店主朱鬍髭細密地在掃着米屑和麥壳。</p>
<p>「叨光，今年太平興隆……望爺爺多進一批貨，多賺幾個錢……」阿貴巴結上去：</p>
<p>「三百文……請入册子吧！」朱鬍髭歪着臉，露出苦鬱的笑容，瞟了他一眼，遞過一堆已經發了淸黃的銅幣。</p>
<p>「請高升！……爺爺。」</p>
<p>「這已是一升米價呢！……」他憎怨地楞着，兩眼望着笆籮裏的米粒，聲音像蚊虫那麽低瘖不暢亮：</p>
<p>阿貴被那沙嗓子感動了！也呆板地瞧着倉廩裏的米，半嚮才回過氣來。　　　　年一度啦！……爷爷……好了</p>
<p>「荒年　……」升米價呢。」老闆終於喉頭說話悲酸的，接着重重還哼了幾下：</p>
<p>他們對望着……荒年……一升米……太平捐……在兩個頭腦裏，同是這樣的起了不知多少次數的翻覆。</p>
<p>阿貴祇能輕步溜出了舖門——</p>
<p>照樣如此的，捐募了幾十家，那籐筐的重量依然沒有增加，阿貴太少興了；他回憶到往年，往年募捐的簡便，獨有今年，荒了！</p>
<p>他心口愁悶着，脚步變得蠕慢而彷彿上了鐐，那麽沉重和酸軟。遠處的鑼聲還是震響着。</p>
<p>在穿過一條寗靜的深巷的時候，阿貴重重地咒駡了！——咒駡那「荒年」：　　「入她媽媽的！……天爺爺。」　　註　（一）槍手　舊式水龍上裝着水槍，指槍的人，就稱他為——槍手。</p>
<p>（二）太平捐　每户納了捐稅，可保平安，這捐費給掌管水龍的人們，在發生禍災時，也就當作他們的勞資，鄕鎭上俗名「太平捐」的。</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）上午十時至十時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「紅樓夢紫娟哭林」　　風雨瀟瀟欲斷魂。花枝冷落嘆飄零。紫娟小婢多情女。晨昏侍奉伴顰卿。他是，想起姑娘腸欲斷。禁不住。一陣傷心兩淚盈。小姐呀，想你是，嬌軀常帶三分喘。懨懨藥石竟無靈。雖然，寳二爺生小多相愛。他是，水中明月鏡中人。惟有奴，殷勤小婢深關切。煢煢疎冷孰關情。常言道，紅顏自古遭天忌。曇花一現竟歸陰。到而今，茜紗窗下何人在？只落得，黃土　中葬玉人。小姐呀，可憐你，香魂一縷隨風散。愁緒三更入夢頻。藥燼餘香遺嗅在。菱花月冷被封塵。窗前千個琅　竹。幾幹斑斑帶淚痕。冷凄凄一座瀟湘館。寂寂香閨深閉門。聽那，鸚哥不管人憔悴。喃喃弄舌葬花聲。小姐啊，你泉台渺渺歸何處。臨逝可囑兩三聲。到如今，人亡物在香魂渺。秋雨秋風愁煞人。奴是，漫漫長夜眠難穩。疊疊傷心到五更。覩物思人腸欲斷。夢魂中，不見你女東君。奴是孤零零，寄跡榮寗府。宛如，人去樓空巢亦傾。看那，落紅滿地無人掃。埋香塚，有誰肯去葬花魂。紫鵑哭到傷心處。緊咬銀牙嘆幾聲。他是，聲聲哭泣淋淋淚。小姐你陰靈慢慢行。與你，黃泉路上伴晨昏。</p>

<p>麟記（一二三〇）下午二時一刻至三時</p>
<p>開篇『夢裏前塵』</p>
<p>宵來懨懨臥書房。想入非非入睡鄉。恍恍忽忽游園去。巧巧恰遇美紅妝。此時是，初收炎炎長夏暑。纔迎蕭蕭早秋凉。信步徐徐過廊下。驚見姣姣美嬌娘。見他是，春色淡淡粉黛畫。秩水盈盈秀髮藏。身御薄薄短羅襖。手提輕輕小綫囊。脈脈含情艷似玉。嬝嬝多姿麗如鳳。她見我，翩翩年少風流貌。殷殷常將秋波飄。低低遂把卿卿喚。陣陣又聞口脂香。我原是悠悠本虛中饋願。她也是，忡忡又無如意郞。二人是，猩猩相惜心心印。雙雙並肩過橫塘。塘內是。潺潺碧水鴛鴦滿。交頸依依樂洋洋。我們是，鶼鶼願效于飛樂。戀戀但望學鴛鴦。怎奈是，滴滴已盡銅壼漏。忽忽好夢終不長。醒來已出杲杲日。空空原是夢一塲。</p>
<p>周振玉又妖傳</p>
<p>元昌（一一二〇）午夜零時三刻到一時半</p>
<p>大觀園景十分幽。疑是蓬萊小九洲。目前草堂開幽雅。分明佳景伏紅樓。中藏絕代如花女。人說如花花尙羞。潚湘館外琅　影。苦雨酸風盡是秋。父偏遠外娘偏苑。倚偏雕欄恨不休。園林暢。曲景幽。往來只有衆了頭。懶於梳洗尋常慣。只怕黃昏時星月宛如勾。鈎起胸中萬斛愁。不幸慈娘先去世。伶仃孤女在外家留。老祖宗愛惜如珍寳。姊妹情深意氣投。遠隔椿庭千里外。夢魂兒常繞過揚州。巴得一封欽詔旨。舞斑衣聊把孝心酬。幾時慰我平生願。蓮坐焚香日夜修。最苦憐一段關心事。兩字終身不自由。雖然日後成佳偶。又未曾將月老謀。此情羞向外人說。對月臨風空淚流。自家痴念自家謀。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) At the provincial government meeting on the 21st, Lin Yunjie proposed and passed a motion to ban opium and gambling throughout the province. Hu Jixian, Jin Zenceng, and Xie Yingzhou were tasked with drafting detailed implementation measures. It was also resolved to reorganize finances and stabilize foreign exchange rates. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to an official announcement today, the provincial government has decided to ban opium and gambling in Guangdong Province. Provincial Chairman Lin Yunjie stated that this measure was planned to be implemented earlier, but due to the fact that most of the Guangdong province's military expenditures came from opium and gambling revenues, the restriction plan was not implemented. Lin told a Reuters reporter today that opium and gambling are the two major ills of Guangdong province, and their tax revenue is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Under Chen Jitang's rule, he could not ban these two ills. Now that unification has been achieved, the political and tax systems will be reformed, and opium and gambling will be banned as soon as possible. The Provincial Council has now been entrusted to draft a detailed plan to ban these two ills as soon as possible. (21st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Kong Xiangxi Discusses Reorganizing Guangdong's Finances, Resolves to Abolish All Extortionate Taxes, and Establish a Branch of the Central Bank in Guangdong <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi stated that the Central Government has decided to simultaneously reorganize Guangdong's finances and currency. He dispatched Zou Lin, Song Ziliang, and Wu Jiantao to Guangdong to first reorganize Guangdong's finances and currency. He had detailed discussions with Yu Hanmou in Nanjing and the ministry decided on a plan, to be implemented after further inspection of the situation in Guangdong. Regarding the reorganization of the currency system, he separately dispatched Li Tiaosheng, Deputy Director of the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun, Manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, to Guangdong to assist. They are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 22nd. Zou, Song, Li, and Bei have considerable experience in Guangdong's finances. Upon arrival in Guangdong, they will consult with Chairman Lin Yunjie to draft concrete measures for early approval by the ministry. The principles for reorganizing Guangdong's finances this time will be to clearly delineate central and local tax revenues and abolish all former extortionate taxes to restore the economic vitality of the people of Guangdong and further develop its original construction, ensuring that supply and demand are balanced. In terms of finance, it has been decided to replace the local currency with the central legal tender to achieve unification and establish a branch of the Central Bank in Guangdong to handle national treasury revenue and expenditure. Based on the local financial situation in Guangdong, the province's revenue will be used for the province's expenses. Due to the chaotic state of finances in the past, considerable subsidies from the central government are still needed. Guangdong's finances are of great importance to the entire national finances. In the past, remittances from overseas Chinese reached tens of millions, which helped balance international payments. Due to the unsound financial and currency system in Guangdong, these remittances gradually decreased. After reorganization, they should be considerably restored. Wu Jiantao recently returned from an overseas inspection and has many insights on tax reorganization. He was also specially appointed to be responsible for the development of tungsten mines in the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Yunnan border region. Tang Haian has telegraphed that he assumed office as the Liangguang Salt Commissioner on the 21st. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing from Lushan on the 21st to preside over the Executive Yuan meeting. He met with Suma, the Japanese consul in Nanjing, at the ministry at 6:00 PM. He went to Shanghai that evening to handle affairs at the Central Bank and is scheduled to fly to Lushan from Shanghai on the 23rd. His wife, sons, and daughters are scheduled to travel from Nanjing to Lushan on the Customs cruiser "Wenxing" at 4:00 AM on the 22nd. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the reorganization of Guangdong's finances, the Ministry of Finance has dispatched Zou Lin and Song Ziliang to coordinate everything. Regarding the current state of Guangdong's finances and the issue of changing the silver dollar system, Kong gave a brief report at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 21st. Concrete discussions on the overall reorganization plan will await the detailed reports from Zou and Song upon their arrival in Nanjing. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Hanmou, upon learning that the Ministry of Finance had dispatched Vice Minister Zou Lin to Guangdong to inspect finances, telegraphed Kong Xiangxi on the 21st, expressing his welcome and requesting that Zou be directed to fly directly to Shaoguan for consultations. In addition, Li Shuzong, the Guangdong Gendarmerie Commander, telegraphed the Ministry of Finance on the 21st, stating that he had dispatched troops to supervise and strictly prevent the smuggling of silver reserves, which are related to the financial lifeline of Guangdong Province. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Financial circles have learned that Chen Jitang previously sent Feng Rui to Nanjing, who stated to the ministry that the amount of silver dollar notes issued by Guangdong was 170 million yuan. It is now reported that the amount issued has reached as high as 250 million yuan, with only about 100 million yuan in silver cash reserves, a significant shortfall. During Chen Jitang's upheaval, the cash reserves related to Guangdong's financial lifeline were fortunately not lost due to the Central Government's dispatch of warships to blockade the waters of Guangdong and Hong Kong and the close monitoring by Guangdong's financial circles. However, Chen took away 7 million yuan in silver dollar notes and 3 million Hong Kong dollars from the Guangzhou Main Branch. Chen also took away 800,000 Hong Kong dollars from the Hong Kong branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank. Li Zongren also withdrew 2.2 million yuan in silver dollar notes from the Guangzhou Main Branch. The cash reserves for the Guangdong notes were already insufficient. Now that Chen and Li have taken away such a large sum, everyone is outraged. Now, Li Tiaosheng, Deputy Director of the Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun, Manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, will soon travel from Shanghai to Guangdong to consult with Yu Hanmou, Lin Yunjie, Song Ziliang, and Guangdong's financial circles to discuss reorganization, which should lead to concrete and appropriate measures. Zou Lin, accompanied by Song Ziliang and Wu Jiantao, is flying to Guangdong and is expected to arrive on the 21st. Tang Haian also assumed office as the Liangguang Salt Commissioner on the 20th and can immediately begin reorganization with Yu and Lin of the central national tax agencies and local finances in Guangdong Province. In the past, Chen Jitang intercepted customs, salt, and consolidated taxes in Guangdong, and Chen Weizhou openly smuggled goods with warships, causing incalculable losses to the national treasury. This should be thoroughly reformed from now on. In addition, Guangdong is known for its numerous and miscellaneous taxes, which should be gradually abolished in the future.

<h3 id="e7">Various Circles in Jiangxi Welcome Guangdong Air Force Personnel with Great Enthusiasm: Students and Citizens Offer Flowers and Gifts; After the Assembly, the Entire Group Marches in Formation <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang) At 8:00 AM on the 21st, various circles in Nanchang held a welcome assembly for the Air Force comrades who came to Jiangxi at the public stadium. Approximately 50,000 people from all walks of life attended, with unprecedented enthusiasm. Cheng Shigui presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the welcome. Fan Zhengbo gave a speech, and students and citizens offered flowers and gifts. Five resolutions were passed on the spot: (1) Telegram of comfort to Chairman Chiang; (2) Telegram of comfort to Chairman Yu and all officers and soldiers; (3) Request the Central Government to commend the Air Force comrades who came to Jiangxi; (4) Request Chen Jitang to go to Nanjing to participate in the National Defense Conference; (5) Circular telegram to the whole country supporting thorough unification of military and political commands, and forever eliminating internal strife. Xie Mang, the representative of the Air Force, replied, stating that the recent upheaval in Guangdong and Guangxi was extremely unfortunate. With the nation facing such a grave crisis, civil war must not be allowed to recur, leading to self-destruction.

<h3 id="e15">Reflections After the Guangdong Situation is Settled <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Since the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to abolish the two Southwest Agencies and appointed Yu Hanmou as the Pacification Commissioner of Guangdong Province, responsible for reorganizing the military affairs of the entire province, the Southwest prepared to convene an extraordinary meeting by the Central Executive Committee members remaining in Guangdong to show their opposition to the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session. At the same time, Chen Jitang and Li Zongren began organizing the National Salvation Allied Army, with Chen and Li taking on the roles of commander and deputy commander, respectively. They also tried their best to encourage Jiang Guangnai, Cai Tingkai, and others to join in cooperation. The crisis that was about to be quelled seemed likely to reignite. The tension in the hearts of the people at that time can be imagined. Afterwards, it was repeatedly reported that contact had been made in Shaoguan, and the batch-by-batch entry of the Guangxi army into Guangdong further showed that military affairs would be difficult to avoid in the end. Before long, the situation suddenly changed. The officers and soldiers of the Guangdong army did not want to fight among themselves, and the aviation personnel also completely surrendered to the Central Government, leaving Chen Jitang, who could not achieve anything on his own, with no choice but to fold his wings and flee to Hong Kong amidst hesitation and lamentation. The tense situation that was about to erupt disappeared like dispersing wind and clouds, returning to nothing. This was truly beyond what we had expected at the beginning. It was also due to the shared wishes of the entire country that were able to inspire each other.</p>
<p>Based on the course of this Guangdong Incident, we can gain two important reflections. First, under the current circumstances, peaceful unification is truly the unanimous demand of those above and below. Anyone harboring ambitions cannot violate this ironclad principle. Therefore, although the Central Government wanted to maintain its authority, it had no choice but to take the path of political resolution. Guangdong could only vent its anger by using the pretense of resistance to foreign invaders. From beginning to end, there was no public denunciation of the Central Government by Guangdong and Guangxi, nor were there clear orders from the Central Government to suppress the two regions. Even in the last few scenes, the telegrams between Chiang and Chen adopted a tactful attitude to preserve personal friendships. The so-called "severing relations without using harsh words" can be seen in this action. This proves the profound awareness of the national crisis and the respect for the principle of unity on all sides, all of whom are making every effort to avoid giving any justification for internal conflict. Second, the simple-minded soldiers of the past now know to take defending the country as a prerequisite, and that obedience to superiors has limitations. They realize that they are pillars of the nation, not the henchmen of private individuals. Therefore, on the premise of the necessity of eliminating internal strife, they do not hesitate to use the method of undermining the foundations, turning their spears and reversing their swords. This can enable the general military to gain a kind of rapid awareness: whenever a direct superior gives an order to fight, if the motive is to defend against foreign insults, they should go through fire and water and faithfully fulfill their duties. On the contrary, if the purpose is only to seize power and profit, they should stop the killing and wait for enlightenment. If every soldier can be based on the concept of suppressing chaos and inspire the spirit of defending the country, then the opportunity for future civil wars can be eliminated without a trace.</p>
<p>Now, the Guangxi army that entered Guangdong has automatically returned, and Yu Hanmou, who is responsible for reorganizing military affairs, has also returned to the province. The generals remaining in Guangdong, such as Miao Peinan and Zhang Da, have respectively consulted with Yu Hanmou on the matters of taking over. It is expected that the date for the settlement of the Guangdong situation will not be far off. The Central Government has also decided to take this opportunity to thoroughly reorganize Guangdong's finances, dispatching Song Ziliang as a special financial commissioner to Guangdong and Tang Haian to replace the Liangguang Salt Commissioner. Zou Lin, the Vice Minister of Finance, will personally inspect Guangdong to divide tax revenues and unify the currency system. The result of this incident is not only a restoration to the state before the turmoil but also a step forward. The situation of superficial harmony in the past has been completely dismantled, returning to a situation of true unity. We are fortunate that the hidden worries have been dispelled and that the formation of unity has been witnessed. The only point of keen interest in the future lies in how the National Defense Conference will unfold.</p>

According to news from Tangier Port in North Africa, there are currently ten warships in the port that are loyal to the Spanish government, waiting for orders to depart. (21st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to a report from Kings Lisbon, the Spanish rebels have issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding that the government submit, otherwise they will bomb the government offices with airplanes. It is reported that the ultimatum was issued from the Guatelos Weiantos airfield, only a few miles away from the capital.</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday, the troops stationed at the Monta Na camp in the capital rioted and attacked the post office. The sound of rifles was like a string of beads. They were then fought for three hours by troops loyal to the government. The government claimed that it had suppressed the rebels. Riots also occurred at two airfields near the capital. Subsequently, the government issued a wireless broadcast, saying that the rebellion throughout the country had been quelled, but this statement was widely believed to have been made too early. Currently, a large number of rebels are advancing towards the capital. A large team of miners once took freight cars south to stop their advance, but after a brief engagement, they were defeated and retreated. However, the government seems to have succeeded in Seville Province. A team of submarines has sailed from Algeciras to the area. (21st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tangier A reporter from the Associated Press of this place once crossed the border to talk to the rebels. It is claimed that they participated in this rebellion because there was a Communist Party uprising in Spain and they needed their assistance to contain it. (20th, National Telegram)</p>

<p>French Andaye The momentum of the Spanish rebels attacking the Chipucoa region in the north of the country is becoming increasingly obvious. Sixty-five rebels in the Falla area were disarmed this morning. In addition, a huge explosion occurred in this Hopia city at 12:00 noon. It is said that the Dal La Chai Bridge has been destroyed, and road traffic from the city to Bon Jin Lona City has also been cut off as a result. Everywhere, one can see troops with strange colors, armed militias, and Red Cross ambulances, constantly passing by, which proves that the future conflict is just beginning. The French border authorities have taken various measures and sent armed gendarmes to guard the bridges in Bijo Hopia City for vigilance. (21st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>French Andaye The authorities in the city of Irun in Navarre Province, northern Spain, recently received intelligence that the rebels are attacking through the border mountains, so they issued an alert and took strict precautions. The situation in the city is therefore tense. It is expected that the rebels will attack the city this afternoon. The city's police. Militia, and youth volunteers, etc. have prepared everything. In addition, many journalists originally planned to go to Spain to cover the news, but because the country's border has been sealed off and they cannot enter the country, they are still stranded in this city.

<h3 id="e32">Locarno Issue: Britain, France, and Belgium Issue Declarations; Meeting to be Held in London Tomorrow; Plans to Solve Problems Comprehensively; Achieve Consolidation of European Peace <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Locarno Conference, the governments of Britain, France, and Belgium recently issued a public announcement at 2:40 this afternoon in their respective capitals, stating: "The representatives of Britain, France, and Belgium held the first Locarno Conference in London on March 19 and established a draft agreement. Now, after exchanging opinions, it has been decided to hold another meeting in London on the 23rd of this month to discuss the current international situation and to consider what appropriate methods should be used to realize the aspirations of each country to comprehensively solve problems and consolidate peace." (21st, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Locarno Conference, the French Ambassador, Gorpine, recently visited Foreign Secretary Eden again this morning and agreed to publish the first joint declaration of Britain, France, and Belgium before the meeting, in accordance with the suggestions made by France. The second declaration will only be issued after the meeting. The British government also requested the French government to undertake the drafting work to limit the scope of the three-nation conference and stated that this meeting is of a preparatory nature. Once it is over, a five-nation conference should be convened so that Germany and Italy can come out and participate. (21st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The highest British diplomatic authority recently issued a declaration to the press in the afternoon, roughly saying that the three-nation conference of Britain, France, and Belgium must avoid discussing various issues related to general policies and focus on preparing for the five-nation conference as its main purpose. The initiators of recent diplomatic problems have been countries promoting dictatorial systems, while democratic countries have mostly followed behind. The convening of this three-nation conference allows democratic countries to take diplomatic initiative again and restore their original position. After the three-nation conference is held, the five-nation conference will be convened, with Italy and Germany participating, and then a broader European conference will be convened. As far as the five-nation conference is concerned, its main purpose is to conclude a new Western European convention to replace the Locarno Convention. In addition, the issue of resolving the general situation in Europe should also be mentioned. The location of the last Great War was not in Western Europe. If you want to appease the situation, the various problems in other parts of Europe should also be discussed. In the current state of Europe, democratic countries and dictatorial countries will be divided into two major groups, confronting each other. In the eyes of the British government, this trend should be avoided by the five-nation conference. According to what our reporter knows, the British government wants to strictly limit the scope of discussion of the three-nation conference to avoid causing a backlash from Italy and Germany. However, the three-nation conference will definitely be held as scheduled. Even if Italy and Germany have criticisms, they are not acceptable to Britain. (21st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Where is the Hirota Cabinet Going? (4) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota's response to this "historical speech" is "establishing constitutional government", and what about Army Minister Terauchi? He publicly announced to Saito: "I have the same feelings about the purpose of the speech. From now on, active-duty soldiers will participate in politics, and I, an unworthy person, will carry it out." People generally believe that Saito's speech was only a verbal victory, which is quite a misunderstanding. The mission of the Hirota Cabinet is not to use high-pressure means to subdue the military, but to have the power to put the military slightly on the right track. Because his regime is transitional. During the transition period, he suppresses leftists and corrects rightists. From a historical point of view, the rise of the military is by no means the personal will of Baron Araki and General Masaki. Instead, there is an undeniable trend behind him, that is, the crisis of Japanese capitalism after the Wakatsuki Cabinet and weak diplomacy. At present, the London Treaty, which the young officers consider a great shame, has become waste paper, and the continental policy they hold is being completed one by one; moreover, the unexpected victory over China and the development of Manchuria have not only temporarily alleviated the crisis of Japanese capitalism, but even the petty bourgeoisie, who have always been dissatisfied with the regime, have lost their enthusiasm for supporting radical fascism. Unless the proletarian movement stimulates it; unless the equilibrium point on which the Hirota Cabinet stands is broken, it is very difficult for radical fascism to take the stage at present. For the above reasons, the military during the Hirota Cabinet era took the Terauchi type, not the Araki type. When General Araki was rampant, the actors of the "May 15th" incident were not only at large, but also carried the crown of protecting the imperial country; during General Terauchi's tenure, the coup leaders of the "February 26th" incident were not only severely punished, but also engraved on their foreheads with the crime of traitors. These distinctions can be proved by the military court authorities' announcement of Lieutenant Colonel Aizawa's death sentence the day after Saito's speech (May 9). At this time, Manui, who defended Aizawa, was demoted to a member of the General Staff Headquarters, and Dr. Uzawa had already disappeared.</p>
<p>The temporary retreat of the military is also the demise of a certain group of political parties. Here we should point out to the reader Fusanosuke Kuhara. This loyal supporter of General Yoshikazu Tanaka, a politician of the Japanese industrial chaebol, is the person whom Takao Saito called linked to the military. Before the coup, with a single effort, he gained three million yen from the stock market. After the coup, suddenly newspapers and publications called him "missing". It is said that a prominent radical fascist politician would be "missing" in the "China bandit country" (Dalian Mitsui's description of our country), but in a country that claims to be a defender of East Asian civilization, it would simply become incredible. However, the Shanghai Japanese Daily News published a piece of news at that time that Kuhara was imprisoned with more than seventy members of parliament who were bribed. If it was only for this sesame-like matter that he was imprisoned, he would never be "missing". Moreover, the situation that "re-emergence is probably impossible" can be expected to be very serious. His demise meant that the Seiyukai lost a director who was good at making trouble; on the political stage, there was a lack of a strong general who would stir up trouble with Araki and others from time to time. However, this can only be regarded as the demise of the "National Polity Clarification Faction", and cannot be regarded as the demise of the chaebol he represents. Not to mention that all the shares owned by Kuhara were taken over by the Nomura chaebol, and Nissan, which was controlled by Yoshisuke Aikawa, was still thriving with the support of the military's "national automobile policy." Why is this so? Originally, Kuhara's activities, in addition to seeking benefits for the Nissan chaebol, also mixed personal motives. He wanted to overthrow President Suzuki and did not hesitate to create factions within the Seiyukai; he wanted to collude with Araki to seize power and raised the banner against the group of senior officials, even to the point where he, as a "constitutional politician", joined hands with the young officers who took direct action; these were personal behaviors and had little to do with Nissan. But from another perspective, the development of Nissan chaebol's military industry cannot lack the military, and the people who are responsible for communication are the Kuhara. Now that Kuhara has fallen due to personal motives and behaviors, Nissan chaebol's military industry is still expanding to meet the needs of Japanese capitalism at this stage.</p>

<p>Istanbul, Turkey – The new Straits Convention was officially signed in Montreux today. The Turkish government ordered General İsmet İnönü, the Prime Minister, to personally lead troops and enter the Straits zone at midnight to garrison. The demilitarized zone of the Dardanelles Strait after the European War has been abolished. The Turkish government, in celebration of the restoration of sovereignty, has designated this day as a national day of celebration. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>The Capital of Turkey – According to the new Straits Convention, Turkey can immediately re-establish fortifications in the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits. A large contingent of the country's army formally entered the Straits zone last night. Flags were raised everywhere this morning to mark the celebration. Loudspeakers were installed everywhere to broadcast the Montreux Conference’s signing of the new convention and various patriotic songs. A torchlight parade was held in the capital last night, with soldiers and the public participating. They circled once in front of the statue of President Kemal Atatürk and were reviewed by government officials in front of the Ministry of National Defense. Istanbul, being within the demilitarized zone, had all its streets with flags flying and electric lights illuminating as if it were daytime. The public cheered as the troops passed by. Several warships, adorned with lanterns, slowly entered the Bosphorus Strait, followed by many small boats, to show that under the leadership of President Kemal Atatürk, Turkey has restored sovereignty over the two straits. The local residents cheered thunderously, marking a grand occasion. (21st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Montreux – The Montreux Conference held its final meeting tonight at 10:15 PM for the signing ceremony of the new Straits Convention and adjourned at 11:00 PM. From its opening on the 22nd of last month, excluding a ten-day recess in the middle, it lasted a total of nineteen days before coming to a conclusion. At tonight's meeting, representatives from each country signed the treaty in turn, followed by the Turkish chief representative, Foreign Minister Rüşdü, who delivered a speech saying, "For those countries that have not sent representatives to participate in today's conference, I hope that they will either sign and join directly in the future, or provide moral support for the new convention signed today." After his speech, Lord Stanley, the British representative, Mr. Litvinov, the Soviet representative, and Mr. Titulescu, the Romanian representative, successively spoke, all stating that the results of this conference were extremely important. The Japanese representative, Mr. Sato, also rose to speak, saying, "Japan is currently not a member state of the League of Nations, which is where our difficulty lies. In this situation, we cannot but raise reservations about certain points of the new convention. However, apart from this, our government will fully respect the provisions and spirit of this convention and provide convenience for its implementation. The measures established by the Montreux Conference aim to safeguard peace in the Near East, and its positive impact may also extend to the distant Asian continent. This is what I sincerely pray for." Then, representatives from other countries, including the French representative Mr. Boncour, also spoke, and the meeting was then declared adjourned. (20th Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Montreux – After the signing of the new Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits Convention, political figures have all attached great importance to it, saying that it is the first time that one of the peace treaties of the European War has been amended through legal means. It is also the first time that Japan has signed an international treaty after withdrawing from the League of Nations. It is also said that although Italy did not participate in the Montreux Conference, it will contact Turkey directly as soon as possible to join the new convention. Both Turkey and the Soviet Russia, which are most concerned about the new Straits system, have felt satisfied. According to news from Turkey, the government and the public have celebrated the restoration of the right to arm the straits and the restoration of complete sovereignty over part of their territory. The situation is very enthusiastic. As for Soviet Russia, the benefits it can obtain according to the new convention are even greater than those it had during the Tsarist era. If war breaks out in the future, it can both block the Black Sea and control it, and its fleet can freely enter and exit the Black Sea. Although other countries have made many concessions on this level, the main interests of these countries are not in danger as a result. In short, the sincere cooperation of the countries in the Black Sea region has been fully realized due to the establishment of the new convention. This is something that all the delegations are happy about. (21st Havas Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e36">British House of Lords Discusses Far East Issues; Smuggling in North China Harms All Countries; British Embassy in Peiping Does Not Give Up; British-Japanese Relations Have Not Reached a Compromise <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(London) The House of Lords debated the smuggling situation in North China today. Opposition leader Lord Marley criticized the attitude of British merchants in Shanghai, saying that they cannot entirely blame the Japanese for the decline of British trade in China due to illegal and unfair competition; British merchants in Shanghai must also bear some responsibility. This difficulty may be resolved by the League of Nations. If Japanese aggression against China continues unabated, China will inevitably rely on Russian friendship to resist Japan. Marley then cited a recent satirical cartoon in the Shanghai North-China Daily News, depicting China connecting a telephone between Tokyo and Berlin. Locals in Shanghai believe that the Japanese occupation of the Municipal Council is commonplace, and many Britons also think so.</p>
<p>Today's debate was initiated by former Secretary of State for India, Lord Peel, who said that the situation in North China now needs constant attention. He then elaborated on the smuggling situation there, saying that recently two batches of bullets and armaments have been transported, and those who sell drugs will of course take this opportunity to pour drugs into China. A significant number of these goods are manufactured in Japan and can now be transported at will. The impact on China's finances can be easily foreseen. It should be known that this not only disrupts China's trade but also hinders China's foreign debt secured by tariffs. It is conceivable what kind of adverse effects the entire Chinese administrative system and China's currency will suffer. In the past ten weeks, the British and American ambassadors to Japan have repeatedly asked the Japanese government to curb smuggling in North China, but the Japanese government has paid little or no attention to it. The Japanese are now basing their actions on suspicion, economic oppression, and the general feelings of isolation from the world. The Japanese seem to be fighting the British because the British interests interfere with their own. However, recently many Japanese have felt the need to reach a general understanding with Britain.</p>
<p>Lord Peel then asked whether the British government could not carefully test the value of this feeling and sincerely ask Japan to explain its needs and negotiate an agreement that not only suits Japan but also includes the rights and happiness of China. He believes that this move can dispel all the clouds of suspicion in the Far East.</p>
<p>Lord Peel then mentioned the Soviet Russia's control of Outer Mongolia, asking whether Russia truly has an aggressive attitude. He believes that Japan's fear of Russia is partly hereditary and partly due to reality. One thing is clear now: the Japanese military's aggression against China is equivalent to driving China into Russia's arms. Lord Peel then described the extraordinary progress made by the Nanjing government in the past four years, saying that Japan can secure its market in China through friendly agreements. He was followed by former Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Newton, who spoke in support of Japan, saying that Japan had been treated badly in Europe in the past forty years. The cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance and the misinformed intervention in Manchuria affairs, attempting to expel the Japanese from Manchuria, are particularly regrettable.</p>
<p>Next, Minister of Public Works Lord Stanhope rose to speak, saying that Japan has now increased its garrison in North China, making it extremely difficult for China to take action there. The situation in North China is very unstable, leading to a surge in smuggling. This is not only unfortunate for China but also harms all countries that trade with China. The British government has no intention of abandoning the British Embassy in Peiping but will maintain it. Another office of the embassy will be established in Nanjing. The British government is now focused on strengthening friendly relations with Japan. However, the current level has not yet reached the point where an agreement can be established because it is currently difficult to conclude a treaty that truly suits British policy in China. British policy in China is to maintain the Open Door Policy so that everyone has freedom of trade. The British desire to strengthen friendly relations with Japan has not been achieved due to recent incidents. "Manchukuo" has closed its doors and prohibited British trade. Other incidents, such as the mistreatment of Indian merchant couples in Changchun and the accusation of two British soldiers in Peiping, are all obstacles to the friendship between the two countries and prevent it from progressing. As for concluding a treaty, it is even more difficult. Now, in order to promote friendly relations with Japan and conclude a treaty that satisfies all three parties—China, Britain, and Japan—these incidents must be investigated to determine their cause. What Britain emphasizes is that China should have a strong and stable government. If it can be obtained, with the support of Japan and the United States, it will not only benefit China and Britain but also benefit Japan the most. Japan's trade with China accounts for a very large share. Lord Marley recently advocated that the League of Nations convene a conference to resolve the Sino-Japanese issue. He believes that the time is not yet ripe today. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords held a meeting today to discuss the Far East issue and the relations between Britain and Japan. Conservative Party member Lord Peel was the first to speak, saying that Britain has important interests in the Far East, so Britain must pay close attention to the changes in the situation there. He also said that when Sir Leith-Ross recently visited Japan, he heard the Japanese government provide assurances that Japan does not intend to interfere with China's international status. Conservative Party member Lord Newton spoke after Marley, defending Japan.</p>
<p>Minister of Public Works Lord Stanhope responded on behalf of the government, saying, "The situation in North China is very insecure, and as a result, smuggling has increased even more. This is unfortunate for both China itself and the countries engaged in trade with China. As for Japanese-Russian relations, the two sides have recently tried to demarcate the boundary between 'Manchukuo' and Outer Mongolia, and between 'Manchukuo' and the Soviet Union. If this work can be successful, the border disputes that have occurred repeatedly recently and are enough to cause danger can be expected not to be seen again. This also means that if we want to enhance the friendship between Britain and the countries in the Far East, we cannot allow these disputes to continue to occur. We should now try to establish a solution that not only satisfies us and Japan but also satisfies China," and so on. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) The House of Commons met this afternoon to discuss the government's request for additional funding for the defense budget (totaling about 19 million pounds). First, Minister for Coordination of Defence Sir Thomas Inskip gave a long statement on the defense coordination work currently being carried out by the government, saying, with regard to the navy, the House of Commons can feel satisfied, and no party needs to be worried. With regard to the army, the reform started later than the air force, but since Sir Brown, the Director-General of Munitions Manufacture, took office, it can be accelerated. He also said that the sources of munitions have been discovered one after another, and the government has submitted contracts to 52 new factories to manufacture various munitions. Among them, 14 have accepted the contracts, and the production capacity of the remaining factories is being studied. He believes that seven-eighths of what the British army needs can be supplied by domestic factories. The government will set up a new arsenal in Nottingham, and the large arsenal in Woolwich will set up branches in Wales and Scotland. All these new factories will be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry for Coordination of Defence. With regard to the air force, some of the aircraft currently being manufactured are very fast. If they had been used in the Schneider Trophy race five years ago, it would not have been difficult to win the championship. After Inskip finished his speech, Labour Party member Smith spoke to criticize him, saying that the existing organization of the army, navy, and air force still lacks coordination and only increases waste. Conservative Party member Churchill also used his sharp words to criticize him severely, but his criticism was not directed at Inskip himself but at the powers exercised by Inskip, saying that once a war breaks out, the British economic system will collapse. The composition of this power is extremely absurd. The original initiators had no fixed opinions and no foresight. What they have achieved, although called the Ministry for Coordination of Defence, is actually a kind of committee, its internal complexity is like a maze. Even if Sir Thomas Inskip has talent, how can he display it? He (Churchill himself) believes that the government should urgently set up a Ministry of Munitions, but fears that this will not be realized until it is too late. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e40">International Intellectual Cooperation; Our Representative Speaks to the Committee <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the plenary meeting of the League of Nations International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation today, when discussing the issue of cooperation with China, the Chinese representative, Zhang Pengchun, stated that in order for any form of cooperation with China to be effective, it is imperative to understand China's intellectual habits and its recent trends. The two most important points are: (1) the form of China's cultural changes; (2) the new emotions of the Chinese student class. Regarding the first point, although opinions differ on China's cultural changes, all are deeply convinced of the complexity of the process. The lives of people of all classes in China are rapidly progressing in complexity, which cannot be stopped by narrow conservatism. The so-called "modernization" and "Westernization" are even less able to generalize this change. The forms that can be said to be obtainable are: (1) the concrete needs of reality can now be closely analyzed; (2) the historical facts of China, the West, ancient and modern, can seek what they jointly reveal; (3) creative aspects are rich in invention. All these forms are becoming increasingly apparent. In the past, international reports stated that the reforms in Chinese education seemed to be influenced by only one country. Fortunately, this situation has now become a thing of the past. As for the emotions of the Chinese student class, the most important points are: (1) the tense international situation has made students pay great attention to the country's military preparations. Chinese students are vigilant about the current crisis of the country, and their thinking is becoming more concrete, and they are prepared to receive strict training and take unified action at any time. (2) Chinese students are very interested in the farmers who account for 80% of China's population. Many educational institutions are directly active in various rural areas in the interior, and students all wish to go deep into the countryside and struggle from the bottom to create a new China. This is the most important trend, and there is no doubt about its profound impact. Zhang's speech was greatly praised by all parties, and the US representative was particularly impressed. After the meeting, he sent a letter expressing his admiration, saying that China's self-reliance and struggle have made the so-called silent transformation and beautification a thing of the past. Zhang is scheduled to give five lectures at the Geneva International Graduate Institute, then go to England, and then from England to the United States to participate in the annual meeting of the Pacific Cultural Association held in California.

<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin Rickshaw Association opposes the British Municipal Council's rickshaw inspection and tax collection methods. Starting on the morning of the 21st, the association issued a notice to all rickshaw factories to remove the British Concession tax licenses and refuse to operate in the concession. From morning to night, there was not a single rickshaw in the entire concession, causing great inconvenience to transportation. The connection between Special District One and the French Concession in Hebei Hedong was completely severed. Those who went to the British Concession for business had to walk. The British Municipal Council temporarily added vehicles and routes to the public bus line to maintain services. The Rickshaw Association submitted a petition to the municipal government on the 21st, stating that the rickshaw tax affects business, and they had no choice but to unanimously decide to resist the tax, urging the British Municipal Council to reflect and hope to withdraw the order. They will resume operations in the evening. The municipal government sent personnel to visit the British authorities, hoping they would not insist on their opinion. There are about 2,000 rickshaws in the British Concession. In the past, rickshaw owners paid the tax and obtained a tax license at any time, nailed it to the rickshaw, and could operate. The British authorities now feel this is cumbersome and have specified that starting from August 1st, each rickshaw factory will have to pull the rickshaws to the bureau once a day to inspect the vehicles and issue licenses, to avoid abuses and eliminate trouble. The Rickshaw Association has appealed for many days without effect, and finally decided to use the negative strategy of resisting the tax. It is said that there are 5,000 rickshaw drivers in the industry. Officials are paying close attention to this. The attitude of the British authorities is still firm and there is no sign of change.

To the east are the Panying, Luohan, Tianqiao, and Five Fingers Mountains; to the west are the Fengyun and Guangren Mountains; to the south are the Sengguan, Qingsong, and Fenghuang Mountains; and to the north are the Lion Ridge and Daheishan Mountains. The city is surrounded by mountains. The Rehe River flows from the southeast end of the city to the southwest end, meeting at the Dahe River three miles southwest of Rehe. The cultural capital that has been cultivated for many years is the unique composition of Chengde. Since the Japanese occupation, the Japanese have actively developed industries. According to Japanese surveys, the population and number of households are as follows:</p>
<p>Number of Households Population</p>
<p>(Relationship with Japan) After the Northeast Incident, the Japanese army actively sought to invade the Rehe region. After the conflict broke out, many Japanese soldiers died. The Japanese now consider this to be a place with a deep impression on the Japanese army. The Japanese Kwantung Army considers Chengde to be the most important place. Since last year, a large loyal spirit tower has been built using the latest architectural style, scheduled to be completed in Showa 12 (1937). The main institutions of the Japanese side, such as the consulate and group headquarters, are concentrated here. The main ones are: (1) Consulate, (2) Same Police Department, (3) Group Headquarters, (4) Military Police Headquarters, (5) Special Affairs Agency, (6) Mantetsu (South Manchuria Railway) Office, (7) Resident Association, (8) Elementary School, (9) Telecommunications Company, (10) Joseon Bank Branch Office, (11) Aviation Company Branch Office, (12) International Transportation Company Branch Office, (13) Rehe New Newspaper Office. Transportation in and near the city includes rickshaws, camel litters, railway bureau automobiles, and airplanes. The General Bureau operates automobiles connecting Fengning, Weichang, Gubeikou. Airplanes connect Lingyuan, Chaoyang, Jin County, etc., which is even more important than Mudanjiang in eastern Manchuria.</p>
<p>(Industrial Value) The composition of the Chengde industrial market has a very close relationship with the establishment of the Rehe provincial government. In the past, the products of Rehe were concentrated in Chengde. To give an example: (1) Phoebe wood is transported through Gubeikou, Pingquan, Chaoyang, and Beipiao, using the transportation of the Yan River, and exported to Pingjin and Fengtian, with an annual output of 1.47 million yuan. (2) White pears are moved in from Maogou Gongfu in Longhua and exported to Weichang, Chifeng, and Linxi. (3) Charcoal is imported from Shangbancaizhuang and Zhuangtouyingzi. (4) Leather is imported and exported to China through Gubeikou. Although it is produced near Chengde, it is mostly a collection and distribution center for leather from various places. (5) Carpets and rugs are transported through Pingquan, Chaoyang, and Gubeikou as transportation hubs. (6) Coal is produced within the county and is only used to meet the needs of the county. The importance of the industrial market is not difficult to infer.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Lu Province's Third Phase of Abolishing Exorbitant and Miscellaneous Taxes, and Reducing Additional Land Taxes in Wudi and Eight Other Counties <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Shandong Province government, following orders to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, has already abolished two phases, totaling over 329,000 yuan. Now, starting from July 1st, the third phase, amounting to nearly 200,000 yuan, is being abolished. The additional land taxes in Wudi and eight other counties, which were excessively heavy, are also being reduced. For every yuan of regular tax, the shortfall will be compensated by 40% of the stamp tax revenue allocated to the province by the central government. The remaining amount to be abolished is over 790,000 yuan, which will be abolished when compensatory funds become available in the future. In addition to issuing public notices to inform the public about the abolition of the third phase of exorbitant and miscellaneous taxes, the provincial government has also submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance for record-keeping. The Ministry of Finance has replied, approving the record-keeping and expressing commendation. The following is a list of the counties where the additional land tax exceeds the regular tax by the largest amount, showing the amount to be reduced progressively: Wudi, with a tax rate of 1.713 li per yuan, should levy 89.076 yuan, should reduce 1.400 yuan. Feixian, with a tax rate of 1.849 li per yuan, should levy 91.229 yuan, should reduce 17.219 yuan, and after reduction, should levy 74.010 yuan. Mengyin, with a tax rate of 1.558 li per yuan, should levy 56.885 yuan, should reduce 2.118 yuan, and after reduction, should levy 54.767 yuan. Fanxian, with a tax rate of 1.620 li per yuan, should levy 69.336 yuan, should reduce 5.136 yuan, and after reduction, should levy 64.200 yuan. Puxian, with a tax rate of 2.428 li per yuan, should levy 59.768 yuan, should reduce 22.844 yuan, and after reduction, should levy 36.924 yuan. Rongcheng, with a tax rate of 1.798 li per yuan, should levy 67.466 yuan, should reduce 11.182 yuan, and after reduction, should levy 56.284 yuan. Dingtao, with a tax rate of 1.529 li per yuan, should levy 103.129 yuan, should reduce 1.956 yuan, and after reduction, should levy 101.173 yuan. The total amount to be levied is 598.289 yuan, the amount to be reduced is 72.931 yuan, and after the reduction, the amount to be levied is 525.358 yuan. The additional land taxes levied in the first and second phases in the above eight counties, as included in the local budget案 for the 24th year of the Republic, exceeded 1 yuan and 5 jiao per yuan of regular tax. That is, the additional tax levied per tael of Dingyin (poll tax silver) exceeded 6 yuan. The burden on the people was indeed too heavy. It is now proposed to follow the regulations promulgated by the Ministry and adopt a progressive reduction policy, temporarily reducing it to 1 yuan and 5 jiao additional tax per yuan of regular tax, i.e., 6 yuan additional tax per tael of Dingyin. If compensatory funds become available in the future, further reductions will be considered.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Songjiang: Investigating a Male Corpse with Knife Wounds <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>On the 18th of this month, an unidentified male corpse with knife wounds was discovered behind the Gu Family's Righteous Burial Ground in Huayang Bridge. The cause of death has been the subject of much speculation and uncertainty. Investigation revealed that the deceased, Sun Xinquan, was married to a woman named Huang. Last year, Huang had an affair with Yao Youcai, and Sun exercised his marital rights by reporting the affair to the court. The court found Yao Youcai and Huang guilty of adultery and sentenced them to imprisonment. They have now been released after serving their sentences. The sudden murder of Sun Xinquan is highly suspicious. After the incident, his wife, Huang, and her lover, Yao Youcai, fled together, further increasing suspicion. The prosecutor's office has dispatched judicial police chief Xue Bingzhang to the location of the coffin to open it in the presence of the Fourth Police Station to photograph the deceased for investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Jingruo, residing in Yihua Fang in the city, hired a rickshaw at around 2 PM on the 20th, carrying over a hundred yuan in coins, intending to sell them in Shanghai. While the rickshaw was passing the wooden bridge south of the road, police detective Zhou Zhide, finding his movements suspicious, stopped him for questioning. Wang, in desperation, threw all the coins he was carrying into the river. Upon receiving the report, the First Police Station immediately dispatched police to arrest Wang and ordered people to retrieve the coins from the river for investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Recently, bandits have been rampant in the four rural areas of this county, looting and injuring people. It has been heard from time to time. At around 2 AM yesterday morning, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived at the home of Pui Sunquan, the chief of the village in the open-air temple area of the county's second district. Speaking in mixed accents and wielding weapons, they broke down the front door and forced the family members into one room, tying them up one by one and warning them not to make any noise. The homeowner and his wife resisted the robbers and were severely beaten. The robbers looted clothing, jewelry, and cash totaling over 3,000 yuan and left with a whoosh. Afterwards, family members reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau and requested a thorough investigation. The robbers have already fled without a trace.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Jiading: The Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Against Income Tax <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>To the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of each province, and the Chambers of Commerce of each city, county, district, and town: It is reported that the Legislative Yuan has passed the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, which will be implemented soon. Income tax is considered a good tax system in Western countries, using the surplus of the people to supplement the needs of the state. There is no need to be stubborn when the people and the state are mutually supportive. If the people are rich, how can the state not be rich? There is no need to question this any further. However, among the scholars, farmers, workers, and merchants in our country, those who can be considered wealthy because of the country's advocacy, maintenance, and protection are few. Considering the balance, we are still in a transitional period where scholars cannot find employment, workers have no jobs, businesses are sluggish, and the countryside is bankrupt. However, if the state cannot delay the collection of this income tax, then compassion must be incorporated into the collection process. The purpose of Premier Sun's ambition to relieve the people's suffering must be considered in this tax collection. The main points are as follows: Regarding the first category, income from profit-making businesses, considering the small shops in the interior, assuming that they only have 5% to less than 10% of their actual capital as annual income, but considering the expenses of their family life, the business surplus is not enough to offset it. (According to the interior shop, this type is actually more common) Then, comprehensively speaking, the result is still that income does not offset expenses. Even if the tax is small, it still increases the people's debt. Regarding the second category, income from salaries and remuneration, the average starting point for taxation is 30 to 60 yuan per month. This is only considering the individual's perspective, but who does not have a family? Assuming a family of five or seven, with women, children, and the elderly all relying on one person for livelihood, occasional illnesses and deaths, social interactions, and temporary mandatory donations from the state and local governments, those who have even a little public spirit and decency must borrow to make ends meet. Their suffering is unspeakable. Collecting income tax is truly beyond their means. Regarding the third category, income from savings deposits, having savings deposits seems to indicate affluence. However, the actual situation in the country is that many orphans, widows, and impoverished people cannot support themselves and rely on a small amount of inherited savings or the support of relatives and friends to pool funds, forming savings societies to earn interest to subsidize their livelihoods. (If these savings deposits encounter bankruptcy, they are likely to die) Taxing this is equivalent to taking away their food. In short, it is easy to legislate, but there are many obstacles. The state's income from taxation should not deviate from the principle of using surplus to help the needy. May we ask for your agreement on the following: the first category, income from profit-making, should be taxed only on those that exceed 20% of its actual capital. As for the second category, those with a monthly income of less than 100 yuan should be taxed. The third category, interest on savings deposits, should be taxed only on those with an annual income exceeding 500 yuan. The percentage ratio of the tax rates for these three categories should be earnestly requested to be reduced as much as possible, so that the state's good tax can be collected, and the people will happily contribute. Today, the people are all aware of their obligations, but their ability to bear the burden is too weak. This is but a humble opinion. If it is deemed appropriate, please consider and adopt it, co-sign it to be presented to the superiors, so that the people's desires can be heard. Wang Wangnong, Chairman of the Jiading County Chamber of Commerce in Jiangsu, Jin Boqin, Pan Jisong, Wu Bingshen, and Song Hexing, Standing Committee Members, respectfully request.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Anecdotes of the Southern Inspection Tour: Qu County, an Important Town in Eastern Zhejiang <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Shi Ying of this Newspaper</p>
<p>Qu County is an important place in the mountainous area of eastern Zhejiang, bordering Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui. Its position in eastern Zhejiang is somewhat like an outlying corner with Jinhua and Lishui. Jinhua and Lishui are also important places in eastern Zhejiang, but not as important as Qu County in terms of inter-provincial significance. In the future, when the Beijing-Quzhou Railway is built and meets the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway here, looking towards Nanjing and Shanghai, this place will be precisely at the apex of a narrow equilateral triangle, and its position will become increasingly important. This can be imagined intuitively.</p>
<p>The county was formerly known as the Quzhou Prefecture Seat, and because the major roads of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces converge in Qu County, it is also known as Sanqu. It governs five counties, including Jiangshan and Changshan. Now, a commissioner's office and security command are established, and its jurisdiction has increased by two counties compared to the past. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the large army conquered Quzhou, followed by the Eight Min regions. Later, when the Revolt of the Three Feudatories broke out, Governor-General Li Zhifang rushed to guard this city, and Geng Jingzhong was ultimately unable to succeed. During the Taiping Rebellion, Zuo Zongtang mobilized troops from various provinces and also used this place as a base for attacking the Taiping rebels. During the Fujian Incident in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, although the situation slightly changed due to the overnight expansion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road and its opening to traffic in Jiangshan, Qu County's strategic location meant it had earlier access to transportation. Adequate preparations were made in military supplies, which also boosted the morale of the soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>The city of Qu County was built under the supervision of Tang dynasty imperial guard Chi Jingde. It is surrounded by water on three sides and backed by mountains on one side. There are many paddy fields inside the city. During the Taiping Rebellion, it was besieged for three years, and the people cultivated the land to supply the army with food, and it was never lost. Therefore, it is known as "Iron Quzhou." However, the city is not very high. In this era of three-dimensional warfare, the golden cities and moats of the past are no longer sufficient to rely on. The headquarters of the 18th Army, stationed in the city, adapted to the needs of the times. In addition to military engineering, building roads, and opening new city gates, they also actively promoted public health. Recently, they also held a grand air defense exercise, using the appeal of a lantern festival to attract even people from the countryside to come and see what was going on. This is probably a very meaningful pioneering effort in the counties of the mountainous area of eastern Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Luo Zhuoying, the commander of the 18th Army, is brave, good at strategy, and respected by senior generals. He is praised as a rising star. Through the introduction of my old friend Yang Xingzhi, a lieutenant colonel secretary in the command, I had the opportunity to chat with Luo about issues such as external bandit suppression and the movements in Guangdong and Guangxi. He spoke eloquently for more than an hour, and I was very impressed. I will select what can be mentioned and briefly describe it. Luo believes that in terms of foreign affairs, once a punch is thrown, it must be done with certainty and strength. Years of bandit suppression have reduced the country's strength, which is a great regret. He used the army's deployment in eastern Zhejiang as an example, stating that its main purpose was not to suppress the remaining bandits. However, in the past year, the troops under his command have rarely been completely isolated from suppression work. Although this is a minor distraction, they are still diligently preparing for the current movements in Guangdong and Guangxi. If the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee cannot resolve the matter through political means, the central government, for the sake of national unity, may have to suppress the rebellion. His words were filled with emotion. Later, I was invited to dinner by Zhuang Mingyuan, the director of the secretariat, with Zhu Yulin, the chief of staff, and others as companions. They provided a lot of information, and their kindness was appreciated. Later, I left Qu County and heard that the army was also transferred to southern Jiangxi. Looking up to the situation in Lingnan, the clouds are becoming increasingly dark. I would like to sincerely say to the generals on both sides that if this time they cannot turn hostility into friendship, and if brothers are forced to meet on the battlefield, they should fire as few bullets as possible and preserve as much strength as possible, because these two large expenditures are not like spending someone else's money. The results will all be recorded in the family's accounts, and they must be vigilant against the final days of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The total population of Qu County is about 300,000, of which the Jiangshan and Jiangxi groups each account for almost one-third. Due to the water conservancy of the 72 ditches and the adjustment between highlands and lowlands, even in years of drought or flood, it is only a minor disaster. The ownership of the land originally belonged entirely to the local people, but because they were fond of eating and lazy, they hired foreigners as tenants. They worked diligently and frugally, and after many years, the ownership of the land in the hands of the landlords was mostly transferred to the tenants, and it implicitly became "farmers own their land." Currently, due to the excessive surcharges on taxes and the implementation of the "25% rent reduction," the price of land has fallen, and very few transactions are completed. However, the "25% rent reduction" has suppressed the collapse of a part of the poor farmers. Although it is not unfavorable to the landlords, it is still a good policy. The main products are rice and paper, followed by firewood, charcoal, Dahongqiao timber, etc.</p>
<p>There is a place called "Ten Mile Barren Mountain" where the Zhejiang Construction Department has reclaimed 10,000 mu of land and planted more than 1.3 million tung trees. The district office took over the management, and after three years, when the oil is produced, it can yield a profit of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan per year, which is a great source of wealth. It is said that the monthly management fee of 400 yuan is difficult to raise, and they want to transfer prisoners from various counties to do the farming work, but because they cannot find guarantors, it is difficult to realize, which is a pity. However, in this world, there can never be only benefits without disadvantages. Prisoner reclamation has great benefits and few disadvantages. Why be so particular about guarantees? Moreover, if the planting of tung trees is successful, giving them some benefits would move even the most stubborn prisoners. If there are inevitably shortcomings in the implementation, in order to complete the great plan of planting tung trees, letting a few lucky prisoners slip through the net should be regarded as a general amnesty, which is also worthwhile.</p>
<p>The banditry in the surrounding counties has not been completely suppressed. There are groups of three or five, and there are also groups of dozens of people, running around like wolves, wandering aimlessly. The large army's suppression has no obvious target, and because they do not communicate with the bandits, they are secretly afraid of them, or at least they dare not offend them. Even the baojia chiefs dare not take the position. It is as difficult to get them to report bandit activities to the government troops as it is to snatch walnuts from a monkey's mouth. The kidnapping of wealthy people and attacks on local militias by bandits are silent and invisible beforehand. With a single signal, it erupts, and often it is impossible to distinguish between bandits and civilians, and it is impossible to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves. In a hurry, they do not know what to do. On the morning of the 8th of this month, Kaihua County was once attacked and captured by more than 400 bandits, and there was no clue to be found beforehand. Therefore, at present, political work is more important than military affairs in the suppression work, that is, implementing the so-called "90% politics, 10% military affairs," actively engaging in organizing the baojia, training the militia, and promoting grain storage. In particular, the item of grain storage, when the price of newly harvested grain falls, farmers can pledge to the grain storage to borrow money and sell it when the grain price rises, which is of great benefit to adjusting the rural economy, and national defense food can also be fully prepared in advance, so the promotion is quite vigorous and the results are obvious. It can be seen that the purpose is only limited to suppressing the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>In the city of Qu County, there is a Southern Lineage Confucius Temple, where the portraits of Confucius and his wife Guan Shi are enshrined. It is said that they were hand-carved by Zigong from ebony wood. During the Southern Song Dynasty, they were brought to Quzhou by Kong Duanyou, the Duke Yansheng, and have been treasured to this day. I submitted a card to visit. The two statues are each more than a foot high, sitting side by side. Confucius faces forward, holding a jade tablet, with a dark complexion and vigorous carving. When tapped, it makes the sound of metal and stone. It is said to have become petrified ebony. The current sacrificial official is one generation older than Kong Decheng of the Northern Lineage. He once entered a Japanese military academy and indulged in prostitution and gambling, which was dissatisfying to the clan. The sacrificial official was originally supposed to receive a monthly salary of 400 yuan from the government, but to date, for two or three years, not even a copper coin has been received.</p>
<p>In the Juzhang Hotel where I stayed in Qu County, I saw several old and elegant paintings on the wall. The signature was Wang, the owner of the hotel. I had heard of finger painting, but I had never seen it. Fortunately, this old finger painter used to be in the same industry as me. More than ten years ago, he ran a small newspaper in Shanghai. He said that at that time, the Newspaper Association was attached to the Shen Bao, and he often went there. When I went to see him at this time, we seemed like old acquaintances as soon as we met. Knowing my intentions, the old man spread out a piece of rice paper, dipped ink with his middle finger, and quickly painted a picture of a pine tree and sent it to me. Moreover, when it was finished, it was read to add to the fun. It is said that in finger painting, it is important to use unusual and risky strokes and to use raw paper (without sizing) for painting, so that it will not change for a long time. Gao Qipei (号且圆), a Grand Secretary of the early Qing Dynasty, was able to do this, so he was imitated by finger painters, but very few can use raw paper, and the elegance of the ink is also different. I tried to paint a few strokes, but my finger was bald and could not be sharpened, and there was no way to pour ink into it. Those who are good at finger painting can freely control the shading and perspective, which can be said to be another unique skill in the art world.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Guangdong Natives in Shanghai Telegraph the Central Government, Requesting a Renewal of Guangdong Politics; Separate Telegrams to Director Yu and Fellow Natives, Unanimously Assisting in Reforming Various Corrupt Practices <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that since Chen Jitang's escape, a ray of light has appeared, and the domineering aura has completely disappeared. With Li Bai losing his base of support, decline is imminent. However, Guangdong has been occupied by Chen Jitang for eight years, and his crimes of harming the country and the people are overflowing. The people of Guangdong deeply resent him and wish to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. Although Chen has left, his party's corruption still pervades the province. If it is not thoroughly purged and reformed, then politics will not be clear, and the people of Guangdong will still find it difficult to live. The Guangdong Natives Association in Shanghai and others, thinking of their hometown, have telegraphed the central government, requesting a thorough renewal of Guangdong politics, and telegraphed native leaders and various groups to unanimously advocate for it. At the same time, they replied to Director Yu Wuqi, expressing their patriotic sincerity and determination to eliminate evil, which shows a glimpse of Chen's harm to Guangdong. The original telegrams are recorded below: (1) Chairman Lin of Guling, President Jiang, President Sun of Nanjing, Mr. Tang Shaochuan, Mr. Wang Liangchou, Mayor Ma, Mayor Wu of Shanghai, Mr. Xu Ruwei, the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, various newspapers, and fellow natives: During the Guangdong-Guangxi Incident, fortunately, most of the generals in Guangdong obeyed the central government, Chen's withdrawal, and the situation in Guangdong has temporarily stabilized. All of us natives are overjoyed. Now, there is something that cannot be left unsaid. Since Chen Jitang took power, he has appointed villains and openly engaged in bribery. His corruption and tyranny, exploitation, and extortion are rare among warlords in history. Such as excessive taxes and levies, violent extortion, and sheltering opium and gambling, selling official positions and titles, smuggling and tax evasion, enriching oneself at the expense of the people, all kinds of corrupt practices are countless. Even using pawns to compete with the people for profit is called construction. The people of Guangdong are cautious and dare not criticize. In addition, with years of recession and the decline of all industries, the solemn and splendid Five Years Plan is almost equal to being at the end of one's rope. The suffering of the people under tyranny has never been greater than at this time. Now, although Chen Jitang has left, the corruption of his party is still there. If it is not thoroughly reformed, then politics will not be clear, and the people of Guangdong will still find it difficult to live. For this reason, we jointly telegraph the Chairman and President, taking the suffering of the people of Guangdong to heart, thoroughly renew Guangdong politics, and beg all fellow natives to unanimously advocate for it, so that the birthplace of the revolution will not be stained by old habits. The people of Guangdong love the central government wholeheartedly. The telegram is respectfully submitted, and we implore you to examine it. The Guangdong Natives Association in Shanghai, the Shanghai Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Jiaying Five Counties Natives Association, the Chaozhou Natives Association, the Zhongshan Natives Association, the Huizhou Natives Association, the Panyu Yiguan, the Shunde Guild Hall, the Dapu Natives Association, and the Wuyang Natives Association respectfully. (2) To Director Yu Wuqi of the Shaoguan Guangzhou Scouting Office: During the resolution of the Guangdong Incident, you have made outstanding contributions, promoting Bo Nan's awareness, preventing local devastation, and leading the way with respect. Now, there is something that cannot be left unsaid. Since Chen Jitang took power, he has appointed villains and openly engaged in bribery. His corruption and tyranny, exploitation, and extortion are rare among warlords in history. Such as excessive taxes and levies, violent extortion, and sheltering opium and gambling, selling official positions and titles, smuggling and tax evasion, enriching oneself at the expense of the people, all kinds of corrupt practices are countless. Even using pawns to compete with the people for profit is called construction. The people of Guangdong are cautious and dare not criticize. In addition, with years of recession and the decline of all industries, the solemn and splendid Five Rams (Guangzhou) are almost equal to being at the end of their rope. The suffering of the people under tyranny has never been greater than at this time. Now, although Chen Jitang has left, the corruption of his party is still there. If it is not thoroughly reformed, then politics will not be clear, and the people of Guangdong will still find it difficult to live. We specifically telegraph you, based on your love for your hometown and your love for the country, to thoroughly renew Guangdong politics. It is said, "Cultivating virtue requires growth, and eliminating evil requires thoroughness," and "Like a farmer removing weeds." We hope that you will consider this. The Guangdong Natives Association in Shanghai, the Guangdong Overseas Chinese Business Federation, the Jiaying Five Counties Natives Association, the Chaozhou Natives Association, the Zhongshan Natives Association, the Huizhou Natives Association, the Panyu Yiguan, the Shunde Guild Hall, the Dapu Natives Association, and the Wuyang Natives Association respectfully.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Song Ziliang and Zou Lin Fly to Guangdong This Morning <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Guangdong's Finances and Banking</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance has specially appointed Song Ziliang as the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner in order to thoroughly organize the finances and banking of Guangdong Province. He is scheduled to fly there this morning (the 22nd), and Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin will accompany him. Tang Shoumin, Bei Songsun, and Li Tisheng, the Deputy Director of the Treasury Bureau of the Bank of China, will also go separately. According to the details obtained by the reporter from various parties,</p>
<p>Song Convenes Discussions</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance appointed Song Ziliang as the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner, Song went to the China Construction Bank at about 9:00 a.m. yesterday to handle important matters. Then, he convened Finance Vice Minister Zou Lin, Ye Zhuotang, the Director of the Central Bank, Xi Demao, the Director of the Business Bureau, Tang Shoumin, the General Manager of the Bank of Communications, Bei Songsun, the Manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, and others to discuss the organization of the finances and banking of Guangdong Province. The establishment of a branch of the Central Bank was also discussed. They dispersed at about 10:00.</p>
<p>Flying to Guangdong This Morning</p>
<p>According to Song Ziliang, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, he is scheduled to hire a special plane from China National Aviation Corporation to fly to Guangdong on the morning of the 22nd. After arriving in Guangdong, he will investigate the current financial situation of Guangdong Province in detail. Once he has a clue, he will return north to report, and then go to Guangdong again at a scheduled time. Those who will accompany Song include Bei Songsun, the manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, Zhao Jiyan, the assistant manager of the China National Products Bank, and Zhuang Yongling, Song's secretary. Wu Jiantao, the newly appointed Director of the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Regional Unified Tax Bureau, flew from Xun to Beijing yesterday morning, visited Finance Minister Kong to ask for instructions, and took the night train to Shanghai to catch the same plane.</p>
<p>Zou Lin Issues a Statement</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specially visited him at his residence on Gaoen Road last night and was received. He answered various questions from the reporter, saying that his task this time in going south was to inspect the general financial situation of Guangdong Province, because at the beginning of a thorough reform, it is necessary to first understand the actual situation. All the detailed methods of the reform plan have not yet been determined. Although the method of reforming the currency system had been largely decided before, it is now different because the political situation in Guangdong Province has changed. As for the reorganization of tax revenue, the central government has long had unified orders, which are the same in all provinces. Furthermore, although the establishment of a Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank and a Guangzhou branch of the Issuance Reserve Committee can be done with a single order, it is necessary to understand the actual situation there before a plan for implementation can be determined. In the future, when it is implemented, the new Director of Finance Song will be responsible. It is impossible to predict how long I will stay here. I will return north at any time after the work is completed. When the reporter asked if he also had to go to Guangxi, Zou said that it would depend on the political situation at that time.</p>
<p>Tang Sets Off This Morning</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of reorganizing Guangdong's currency system, the Ministry of Finance had previously sent Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, to Guangdong twice to make contact. Tang Shoumin and Bei Songsun were said to be going soon, but because Chen Jitang did not cooperate, it was never completed. Now that the political situation in Guangdong Province has stabilized, it has been decided to proceed immediately. Tang is still staying in Hong Kong, while Tang Shoumin is scheduled to take the North German Company's Boston liner this morning. The Bank of China sent Li Tisheng, the Deputy Director of the Treasury Bureau, and Zhou Shouliang, the Deputy Director of the Business Bureau, to accompany him. According to Zhou, speaking to a reporter yesterday, he has decided to take the same plane as Song Ziliang, while Li will travel on the same ship as Tang, along with three Bank of China staff members. The ship is berthed in the Huangpu River and will set sail at about 8:00.</p>
<p>Bank of China Establishes a Branch in Guangdong</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Central Bank, Song Ziliang has been appointed to go to Guangdong to investigate and organize the general financial and banking affairs of Guangdong Province. He will act in accordance with the will of the Central Government and handle matters in a practical manner in order to relieve the suffering of the people of Guangdong. He will report to Finance Minister Kong at any time by telegram. Song and Zou are scheduled to fly to Guangdong on the same plane on the 22nd. Wu Jiantao, the Director of the Guangdong-Guangxi-Fujian Regional Unified Tax Bureau, has reportedly passed through Beijing, asked for instructions from Minister Kong, and will come to Shanghai to discuss progress as soon as Song, Tang (Hai'an), Bei, and others arrive in Guangdong. In terms of Tang and Bei, their trip is aimed at planning for reforming the currency system. The Bank of China has also decided to send staff to investigate the plan to establish a branch in Guangzhou, with the expectation of realizing it in the short term.</p>

<p>Yang Yongzhai took the night express train to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi took the night express train out of Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, came to Beijing this time to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee and to report to President Chiang on the political situation in Fujian Province. After completing his official duties and arriving in Shanghai, he stayed for four days and left Shanghai for Fujian by China National Aviation Corporation plane at 6:30 yesterday morning with his wife and entourage. It is reported that during his stay in Shanghai, Chen met with the banking community to discuss the regulation of finance in Fujian Province.</p>

<p>Telegrams Xiao Focheng to Go to Beijing</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Wang Quansheng departed from the Philippines to return to the country to attend the Second Plenary Session of the Kuomintang's Central Executive Committee. He has completed his official duties. Yesterday morning, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing. According to Wang, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter, at this time the Central Government convened the Second Plenary Session, and all the members were able to attend on time with a unified will to realize sincere unity and jointly seek national salvation. Guangdong and Guangxi can be stabilized, and the future of national unity is extremely optimistic. I will return to the Philippines soon to convey the central government's intentions to overseas Chinese, and I learned that Wang is scheduled to board the Dollar Steamship Lines' President McKinley last night, and leave Shanghai on the 22nd to return to the Philippines. Before Wang's departure, he telegraphed Committee Member Xiao Focheng in Hong Kong, urging him to come to Beijing immediately. His original telegram read: "To Mr. Xiao Focheng of Hong Kong: My heart misses you after a long separation. I am deeply gratified to know that you have arrived in Hong Kong, both for public and private matters. I sincerely urge you to come to Beijing immediately to jointly plan for national salvation. Yours respectfully, Wang Quansheng."</p>
<h3 id="e86">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Organize Private Inspection Branches <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all industry associations under its jurisdiction to organize private inspection branches for each industry, taking a unified approach. The two notices are recorded as follows: (1) Respectfully announcing that, in order to assist the government in investigating and suppressing smuggling, the Chamber has already organized a Private Inspection Committee that has begun its work. According to Article 11 of the committee's organizational charter, which states, "After the establishment of this committee, the municipal chamber of commerce shall notify relevant industry associations to formulate separate regulations and organize branches, which shall be submitted to this Chamber for public deliberation and implementation," all organizational rules and inspection rules for private inspection branches in various industries have been approved by the second committee meeting. All trade associations related to smuggling should immediately follow the aforementioned resolution, formulate separate regulations based on their respective industry situations, organize private inspection branches, and actively proceed. We are accordingly sending along copies of the organizational rules and inspection rules for private inspection branches in various industries for your reference and action. It is essential that your esteemed association examine and handle this matter, and submit draft branch organizational charters, formulated in accordance with the regulations, to this Chamber for record and implementation within ten days of receiving this letter. (2) Respectfully announcing that, regarding the matter of assisting the government in investigating and suppressing smuggling, the methods of implementation for various industries in this city have already been determined by the Private Inspection Committee established by this Chamber, which has also notified various industries to organize private inspection branches to be led and managed by the committee. As member associations of this Chamber, trade associations in various industries should maintain a unified approach and avoid discrepancies in handling private inspection matters. Fearing that various industries have not paid attention to this matter, it has been resolved at the second Private Inspection Committee meeting to notify all industry associations that matters related to private inspection should be handled in accordance with the resolutions of this Chamber, so as to ensure uniformity. We are accordingly issuing this notice and request your esteemed association to take note and act accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e87">A Beggar from the Northeast Donates Money to Purchase an Airplane <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Accumulated One Yuan Through Three Months of Saving</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Fundraising Committee of the China Aviation Association's Expanded Aviation Patriotic Movement to Purchase Airplanes as a Gift to the Government for Chairman Chiang's Fiftieth Birthday received a letter yesterday from a beggar in Hexi Xinxiang, Northeast, who signed his name. He stated that he was disabled in the war of resistance, his left arm was broken, and he could not serve, so he begged for a living. Now that he learned of the purchase of airplanes to present to the government to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, he expressed his deep sympathy. However, feeling that his heart was willing but his strength was insufficient, he specially donated one yuan, accumulated through three months of begging and saving, along with nine jiao, one fen, and eight li in national currency, with the remainder used for postage and remittance fees. Please accept it. The beggar's wartime injury and begging for a living, not forgetting his patriotism, and raising funds for three months to donate for the purchase of airplanes to celebrate the birthday, is truly commendable. Compared to the general wealthy and unbenevolent, who do not contribute a single penny, only know their own comfort, and have no enthusiasm for saving the country, there is a world of difference. It is said that the association has already accepted the donation and thanked him.</p>
<p>Also, the Airplane Commemoration Society continued to receive donations of one hundred yuan from Mr. Zhang Rangzhi, thirty-one yuan from Zhu Yulu and Xu Yongsheng, twenty yuan from the gentry, merchants, and people of Rushankou, Shandong, seventy-two yuan, one jiao, and five fen from Lin Liangeng, He Huan, and Mao Jiu'an of the Dalai Company's Harrison ship, thirty yuan each from the Yimiao stallholders association and the Qixing Copper Smelting Plant, and twenty yuan from the Qixing Copper Plant's workers' union. The enthusiastic support from all walks of life is evident.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Hai Zhen and Gong Ping to Resume Sailing to Shantou and Guangzhou Today <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Both Cargo and Passengers are Full</p>
<p>The Zhaoshangju's Sihai steamer stopped operations on the 11th of this month and announced it would sail to Shantou and Guangzhou, and stopped selling passenger tickets to Shantou and Guangdong from Shanghai. After more than ten days, because the Guangdong affairs have been peacefully resolved, Zhaoshangju has received instructions from the Ministry of Communications to have the Sihai steamer resume its Shantou-Guangdong route as soon as possible to avoid losses from the suspension. The bureau immediately decided to have the Haizhen steamer be the first to resume the Shantou-Guangdong route, starting today. Passengers, upon hearing the news, rushed to buy Shantou-Guangdong passenger tickets, and they were sold out in a short time. As for the goods of the Guangdong and Shantou merchants that had been suspended due to exchange rates, there was too much accumulated in Shanghai. Now that the Guangdong exchange rate has risen again and the overall situation has been settled, a large batch of goods was rushed to be loaded to Shantou and Guangdong. After the Haizhen was fully loaded, the Gongping steamer was also specially used to transport export goods to Shantou and Guangzhou, and it was also fully loaded. Both ships are going to Guangdong today. This is the first national ship to go to Guangdong after the suspension of Shanghai national ships.</p>
<h3 id="e89">National Products Factory Joint Association Cables Chen Li Bai <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Joint Association yesterday cabled Chen Li Bai separately, requesting them to obey the central government and jointly resist foreign aggression to achieve unity. The message read: (1) Hong Kong, respected Committee Member Chen Bonan, we admire your resignation for national affairs, returning power to the central government, eliminating the ravages of war, consolidating military power, and completing the unification of the country. Your contribution is very great and admired by the whole country. Now the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee has appointed you as a member of the National Defense Conference, and Chairman Chiang has telegraphed to urge you to go to Beijing, which shows the national respect and the central government's reliance on you. Therefore, we specially send a telegram to congratulate you and hope that you will follow your original intention and leave immediately so that national plans can be decided as soon as possible. Our thoughts are with you through this telegram. We hope for your clear understanding. (2) Nanning, respected Director Li and Director Bai of the Guangxi Pacification Headquarters, we believe that our country's situation is so critical that the whole country should work together to overcome national difficulties and revive China. It is even more necessary to unify government orders and military power to strengthen and consolidate the central government, concentrate the lineup, and unite as one to confront foreign enemies, so that the victory of the national revolutionary war can be achieved. You and others swore an oath to launch the Northern Expedition, laying the foundation for the Southeast, and your achievements will be recorded in the party and the country, occupying the most glorious page in the history of the revolution, and all our countrymen are deeply grateful. Now the government is relying heavily on you, specially appointing you to pacify the country and participate in national defense, and we expect that your achievements will be remarkable, establishing the work of ancient times and leaving a name for all generations.

Our thoughts are with you through this telegram. We hope for your clear understanding. The Shanghai National Products Factory Joint Association respectfully.</p>

<p>Overview of Association Affairs</p>
<p>Huang Renzhi reported on the overview of association affairs and work: (1) Membership changes: There are currently 186 members, including 25 specialized members and 6 correspondent members. (2) Meeting status. (3) Relocation of the association's premises: In order to save money and provide a service location for members, most of which are located in the Bund area, for the sake of convenience, it was resolved at the 50th board meeting on December 10, 1935, to move to the fourth floor of the China Exchange Bank on Avenue Edward VII. (4) Work overview: 1. Investigating specialized talents: After this work was carried out in 1934, more than 2,000 cards have been made, and they have been classified by name to create a general register for easy checking. 2. National products movement: Last year, the association joined other groups to organize the Student National Products Year Promotion Joint Association to host the national products movement work, which has now ended. The progress of the work is reported separately by the association in a special book. This year, the association initiated and invited national product groups in Shanghai to jointly organize the Shanghai National Products Movement Joint Association, which is divided into general affairs, domestic, and foreign groups, each with its own work outline. The work is now being actively promoted. In addition to subsidizing 200 yuan for expenses, the association also provides contact and assistance at any time. 3. Rural improvement: Since the Gaoqiao Dengcun Improvement Association was officially established in September 1934, all work has been carried out step by step according to the planned schedule. In the middle of this year, such as carrying out literacy campaigns, holding children's health competitions, assisting the Public Security Bureau in promoting drug resistance, assisting Tunliang Alley in establishing a defense group, handling production mutual aid societies, establishing busy farming nurseries, and repairing Jienan, Zhang Xu, She Gao, Duwan, and Xiguan roads, there have been quite a few rewards. It is now focusing on training cadres so that this improvement work can be handed over to local party members in the near future. 4. People's education and rehabilitation: (A) The Zhabei People's Education and Rehabilitation Center is still entrusted to the China Children's Welfare Association for operation. Since the association re-appointed Mr. Wang Zhenchang as director, he has been determined to reorganize it, and it has greatly improved. Monthly work reports are sent to the association. The number of students in the hospital at the most was 106, and at the least it was 80+. Everyone received education and meals, and all departments of agricultural and industrial work were able to work hard. In addition to the family members taking them back and sending them to the Jiangwan Nursing Home, the hospital introduced 75 vocational elders from July last year to June this year. (A detailed report of the hospital is available separately.) (B) The Songhu Memorial Guangci Hospital has established a vocational training class since the second semester of last year without increasing the budget, and the hospital's industry continues to be reorganized to increase income. This year, Dean Tao Xiaodong resigned, and the board of directors resolved to change the hospital system, recommending three presidents and vice-presidents and hiring a director to handle education and care matters. Jiang Wenyu was publicly elected as the president, and Pan Zhiwen and Zhishi Chun were elected as vice-presidents. Pan Baoyi was hired as the director, and all matters proceeded as usual. (5) Shanghai Statistics: After the association compiled and printed Shanghai Statistics in October 1933, it published Shanghai Statistical Supplementary Materials in April 1935. It was found that the longer the statistical work lasted, the higher its value became. Therefore, it was decided to start compiling the second supplementary material in January of this year, which was still carried out by the staff of the Secretariat. Research on the grain problem: In recent years, the amount of foreign rice imported has been very large. Therefore, in June last year, a grain committee was specially organized to study it, and Director Xie Jiasheng of the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute, Chief Technician Shen Zonghan, and Director Zhao Lianfang of the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Council were invited to the meeting to guide the production and sales plan, and a summary was made on July 13 ( Yuan) Telegraph Chen government adoption, on August 7, that is, by the Executive Yuan approved the National Rice and Wheat Self-sufficiency Plan, and improve the outline of measures, participated in the project, the total number of this year to participate in the various economic and other matters of the secret group is 12, the amount of sponsorship matters, the total number of this year to donate industrial and commercial loan funding and other matters is 5, economic summary, this Association's funding, always relying on membership dues for use, when insufficient, another plan to subsidize, the amount of revenue and expenditure deficiency in the twenty-fourth year, by the Association members respectively responsible for or raise special donations, a total of 11,600 national currency received successively, after moving into the new Association premises from the twenty-fifth year, all expenses, are more economical, this year's budget for the first half of the year, has now been set at 8,529 yuan and 6 jiao national currency, (compared to the second half of last year, a reduction of 2,656 yuan and 4 jiao) assuming the whole year, it should be 17,059 yuan - jiao, (compared to the whole year of last year, a total reduction of 5,312 yuan and 8 jiao) based on past experience, estimated membership dues revenue, to offset the expenditure, still feel insufficient, still follow the usual practice of collecting special donations, is in the process of separately contacting the solicitation.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Gold Exchange Opened Yesterday Morning. Brokers Held a General Meeting <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Gold Exchange's issue of increasing handling fees was settled after Chairman Xu Busheng of the board of directors and Chairman Zhan Liansheng of the Brokers' Association reached an agreement. It was stipulated that a handling fee of one jiao would be levied on each lot, and a bonus of two fen and five li would be given to the brokers. However, the transaction on that day would be levied at half price, and it would be trialed for three months. The Brokers' Association issued a notice yesterday morning, advising all brokers to operate as usual. The brokers accepted the advice and started operating as usual from 9 am. The opening price for September futures was 1,132.4 yuan, and the closing price was 1,132.3 yuan. The Brokers' Association held a temporary general meeting of all members at the association on North Wuxi Road at 2 pm yesterday. More than 60 brokers attended. Chairman Shan Liansheng reported on the agreement reached with Chairman Xu Busheng of the board of directors on the remedy for handling fees. The discussion began immediately. The case of handling fees of one jiao per lot and a bonus of two fen and five li to brokers, but the transaction on the day will be levied at half (person per share) and the broker's bonus will also be calculated as half (one fen and two faces per person) was resolved and approved. A broker made a transaction on the standard gold customer case of each trade, and each broker expressed his opinion. After a long period of discussion, there was no result due to divergent opinions. Finally, the speaker Zhang asked the brokers to handle it themselves. It was not dismissed until about 5 pm.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Czech Astronomer Hujer Arrives in Shanghai from Japan to Talk About the Philosophical View of Astronomy <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Czech astronomer Dr. Hujer recently went to Hokkaido, Japan, with Czech and other foreign scientists to observe the solar eclipse. Now he is passing through Shanghai on his way home. Although the doctor has not been famous for long, he has already given lectures in the United Kingdom, the United States, Mexico, India, Soviet Russia, and other countries in Europe. His specialty is the philosophical view of astronomy. In the past four or five years, he has lectured on this issue no less than 400 times in various places. The doctor told customers that astronomers cannot support themselves by traveling, but it is enough to combine the work and speech. So he can travel to all parts of the world to observe our noisy world. Today's world is in a terrible turmoil, especially in the so-called civilized countries. Science today has the task of fulfilling its obligations, especially astronomy. In the past, scientific knowledge has focused on destructive work. Scientists in the new era must now realize this and use their great power to engage in construction work. Science, as a thing, has only been used casually so far, just like children playing with new toys. However, I have learned the secret of the long-term existence of ancient civilization on this trip to the East, and the so-called civilization of Qin and West is now gradually reaching a precarious point. There are various misnomers in Qin and West's civilization. They certainly know how to invent objects to enjoy many pleasures and conveniences, but this so-called civilization actually contains barbarism everywhere. For example, Japan has certainly mastered the essence of industry and machinery. Japanese people love skyscrapers and complex industrial structures very much and imitate them very hard. Try to do bizarre skills, but Japanese people have not yet captured the essence of Western civilization. India lives under philosophy, and this philosophy is almost incomprehensible to Westerners. Mahatma Gandhi's passive resistance is completely inconsistent with the grand tone of Western culture, so many people cannot understand it. Gandhi and other leaders of Jiadu's failure to rashly adopt Qin-Western civilization is enough to be considered. What is literature? Many people do not yet know that the Earth is a very small part of a large universe. Science can make us realize that people in the entire game and structure of the universe are actually relatively unimportant. The legend that the doctor lived in India for a year and had close ties with Juxiong Gandhi, philosopher Tagore, and other Indian leaders. Before going to India, he studied Sanskrit. After arriving in India, he widely used this knowledge. His book about India will be published soon. During the 1932 solar eclipse, Professor Mitchell of the University of Virginia invited the doctor and American experts to Quebec, Canada, to observe together. Four years later, he lived in the United States and often engaged in research at the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago. He was also invited by the Mexican government to study the astronomy of the ancient civilization of Zhongxiwan. Before going to the United States, he gave a lecture for a year at the Imperial College of Science in England. Now he plans to stay in Shanghai for a few days, then go to Beijing to inspect the Observatory of the new capital, and then go to the old capital to inspect the Observatory in the southeast corner of the ancient city. After completing his official duties, he will return to his country via Manchuria and Soviet Russia.</p>

We will do things, goods work, and we can also be candidates for the era of political ideology, like former US President Hoover, who was also a worker." After the meeting, there were various performances to help the fun, and the exhibition of various achievements was quite colorful.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West People's Livelihood Education Experimental District, jointly established by the Municipal Education Bureau, Daxia University, and the Nian Er Movement Promotion Association, has been established for one year since its inception.

<h3 id="e99">Japanese Merchants Buy Wheat from Exchange, Sell for Profit; No Recent Purchases of Rice Reported <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of Japanese merchants buying and selling grain, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency yesterday morning revisited Mr. Huanxin, who stated that Japanese merchants purchasing rapeseed from China and transporting it to Japan for oil extraction is a common occurrence every year. The Japanese Mitsuyoshi Trading Company purchases wheat from Wuhu and transports it to Qingdao and other places to supply flour mills, because Chinese wheat is cheaper than foreign wheat, involving about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The Japanese Toyoi Trading Company purchased wheat from the Shanghai Exchange and has already made a profit, selling it back on the exchange. As for buying rice, there have been no recent reports of such activity.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Number of Overseas Chinese Expelled in Half a Year Totals 199; Mostly from Japan and Canada <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Due to the global economic downturn and the exclusion of overseas Chinese in various countries in recent years, many overseas Chinese have experienced business failures, and the number of unemployed is particularly high. As a result, many have been forced to pack their bags and return home. In the first six months of this year, a total of 199 expelled overseas Chinese landed in Shanghai, including 119 men and 17 women. The largest number returned from Japan, totaling 117. The next largest group returned from Canada, totaling 33. This was followed by 14 returnees from Vancouver, British Columbia, 9 from Victoria, British Columbia, and 1 each from Mexico, the Soviet Union, and Taiwan. It is also reported that a larger number of overseas Chinese are landing in Xiamen.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Ministry of Communications Orders Telegraph Bureau to Maintain Long-Distance Telephone Lines; Instructs on Line Repair Methods to Avoid Impeding Long-Distance Calls <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications issued an order to the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau stating that when telegraph lines experience blockage, the temporary use of thin wires for connection should be replaced immediately with the original type of wire.</p>
<p>Repair and reinforce the lines properly. The Ministry had previously issued order No. 4692 on September 27, 1935, and instruction No. 4718 on September 30 of the same year, promulgating the "Methods for Repairing Obstructions on Telegraph Lines," which clearly stipulated the relevant regulations.</p>
<p>The Ministry's long-distance telephone lines are gradually increasing, and the security of military communications is extremely important, requiring diligent maintenance. If the line balance is slightly off, problems such as induced noise will occur, making clear communication difficult. Therefore, special attention should be paid to the above-mentioned repair methods, and no negligence is allowed. Also, the</p>
<p>crossing positions and methods of each telephone line have been properly configured and should not be changed in any way. Detailed diagrams should be provided to instruct the workers in charge of each section to be familiar with the number of pairs and the crossing positions and methods of the telephone lines under their jurisdiction to avoid errors. When line workers test the lines, they must do so on the</p>
<p>test line poles equipped with test line clamps, and after the test, the test line clamp must be thoroughly cleaned and tightened. Do not arbitrarily cut the lines. Furthermore, the Ministry has long-standing regulations regarding the locations where long-distance telephone lines enter the bureau. Other intermediate bureaus must not arbitrarily cut the lines or connect other single lines to avoid hindering long-distance calls. All are expected to comply and instruct others to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Guangdong-Guangxi Inspection Group Releases Findings <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Xinxin News Agency reports that the inspection report of the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group, organized by the business community of this city this spring, has been compiled and was officially released yesterday. Excerpts of the key points are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong's Industry</p>
<p>In Guangdong, large-scale factories are all within the scope of provincial operation. Industrial construction in Guangdong is the most important part of the three-year plan. The factories established in Guangdong over the past two years aim to meet the needs of society while also considering the original artisans, so that their livelihoods are not taken away by the rise of mechanical industry. The industries established in Guangdong in the past two years have all adhered to this principle. The Xicun First Industrial Zone includes chemical industries such as sulfuric acid, sodium bicarbonate, ammonia, phosphate fertilizer, potash fertilizer, cement, beer, and soda factories. Henan is the Second Industrial Zone, including textile industries such as cotton spinning, woolen weaving, silk spinning, and ramie silk spinning factories. Guangdong is a unique sugar-producing region in the country. To achieve national self-sufficiency in refined sugar, the entire province has been divided into five sugarcane cultivation zones, dedicated to revitalizing the sugar industry, starting with Guangdong, Huizhou, Chaozhou, and Shantou, and then expanding from there. Each sugar factory will also establish a distillery to replace gasoline, a paper mill to manufacture newsprint and various stationery, a beverage factory to produce beer and soda, and a wood gas generator factory to save fuel for vehicles. A hemp bag factory will also be established to supply packaging for cement, rice, and other grains. Other projects, such as the steel factory, the Wengjiang Hydroelectric Plant, and the Huangpu Shipyard, are all in the planning stages. All of the above factories are able to meet the needs of the province and were established for the people who lack the resources to create them themselves. The total cost is over 40 million yuan. Taking the cement factory as an example, between 1930 and 1931, the average daily import of cement was 50 barrels, with a selling price of 13.5 yuan per barrel, resulting in an annual loss of 24.3 million yuan. Since the establishment of the Xicun Cement Factory, it initially produced 1,200 barrels per day, and now, with expanded machinery, it can produce over 3,000 barrels per day, priced at 10 yuan per barrel. As a result, the price of imported cement has also decreased. It is estimated that the Xicun Cement Factory can recover 30,000 yuan in lost profits per day, or 10.8 million yuan per year. The users enjoy the 6.3 million yuan in profits from the price reduction. Therefore, the Xicun Cement Factory alone can prevent the outflow of over 17 million yuan annually. Additionally, the annual import of foreign sugar into Guangdong is approximately 30 million yuan. It is currently estimated that the sugarcane cultivation zones in Guangzhou, Chaozhou, and Huiyang can collectively produce over 6,000 dan of sugar per day, or over 2 million dan of sugar per year, which is more than enough to meet the needs of the entire province. This will recover 30 million yuan in outflowing funds annually. Furthermore, in recent years, Guangdong's mulberry and silk industries have declined, leaving people with no means of making a living. If the sugar industry is revived, there will be a greater need for sugarcane, and farmers can convert their mulberry fields to sugarcane cultivation. If they lack capital, the provincially operated sugarcane cultivation zones can provide loans. Based on an annual output of 2 million dan of sugar, with 10 dan of sugar requiring one mu of sugarcane, a total of 200,000 mu of sugarcane will be needed. With each household cultivating ten mu of sugarcane, this can support 20,000 households. With five people per household, this can support 100,000 people. If all five cultivation zones are fully established in the future, in addition to meeting Guangdong's own needs, they can also be sold throughout the country, and the annual recovery of outflowing funds will be over 30 million yuan. Moreover, the number of farmers who can rely on this for a living will be even greater. Furthermore, after the establishment of the various factories, they will accommodate many workers. It is estimated that the Xicun Cement Factory and its affiliated Henan Kiln Factory, as well as the three sugarcane cultivation zones, can accommodate approximately 5,000 workers. If we include other workers involved in quarrying and transportation, with an average of five people per household, this can support 40,000 people. This does not include other factories.</p>
<p>Guangxi's Agriculture</p>
<p>Guangxi is located in the southwest of China, on the frontier, with obstructed transportation. Agriculture accounts for 70% to 80% of the economy, and industry remains in the handicraft era. Work is simple and only for use in the province. In recent years, the import of industrial goods from home and abroad has increased sharply. The methods are sophisticated, and the prices are low, which has made the province's only nascent handicraft industry unable to compete, and it is gradually being eliminated. In order to seek self-reliance and save the backward industry, the Guangxi authorities have established sulfuric acid plants, tung oil plants, alcohol plants, tannery, printing plants, and machinery plants, which have modern tool scale. Guangxi has a vast land, humid climate, and is suitable for planting. It is indeed an agricultural province. Food crops include rice, wheat, corn, etc. Rice can be harvested two to three times a year in Guinan. Corn can also be planted twice. Root crops include sweet potatoes and water chestnuts. Legumes include black beans, soybeans, broad beans, etc. Fibers include jute, ramie, and cotton. Other special crops include peanuts, rapeseed, sugar cane, indigo, and tobacco. In terms of fruits, there are pomelos, chestnuts, oranges, tangerines, lychees, longans, cantaloupes, pineapples, etc. In terms of forest products, pine, fir, tea, tung, cassia are suitable for planting in northern Guangxi, and camphor, star anise, cinnamon, Phoebe zhennan, etc. are suitable for planting in the south. There are industrial raw materials and medicinal plants with economic value. Camphor can be extracted from camphor trees, which are the most widely used products in modern chemical industry and are also excellent raw materials for manufacturing explosives. Its relationship to national defense is also very important. Guangxi's natural environment for agriculture is so superior, and agricultural and forestry products are so abundant. However, due to the backwardness of farmers' production technology and the limitations of social capital, it has not been fully developed. For example, rice can be harvested twice a year in central Guangxi, but due to the lack of water conservancy facilities, irrigation in autumn is extremely difficult, so few farmers plant late rice. In the northwest mountainous areas, due to transportation difficulties, surplus grains cannot be exported, and even if they are exported, it is not economical. As a result, farmers' cultivation is extremely crude, and they fail to make full use of the land. At present, the provincial government is making every effort to promote agricultural affairs. It has established an agricultural experiment station in Liuzhou. Wen Anhua will go to the injury to watch. The scale is grand and the results are remarkable. There is also a forest reclamation area that was formerly held by Mr. Wu Tingfang, and there are also achievements. Another agricultural and forestry demonstration area is located at the headquarters of eight militia district cadres schools, and it is expected that the results of the total injury experiment, such as seed selection, cultivation, fertilization, processing, and breeding, will be gradually transmitted from the demonstration injury to the militia cadres students. These students, after leaving school and returning to their hometowns, will serve as village chiefs and principals of national basic schools, and they will transmit it to farmers, which is convenient and easy to popularize. In recent years, livestock, rice, grain, and tung oil have been the main commodities for small exports. If they can be good at promoting charcoal and increase production, the export volume will increase day by day. Guangxi is most lacking in cotton, and combing cloth and cotton yarn are the main imports every year. A cotton cultivation experiment injury has been established to try to restore the inherent cotton production. Iron ore and hardware are quite valuable. Coal is available but not produced. The mines that have been opened, such as tin in Fuchuan, He County, Zhongshan, Hechi, and Nandan, crane in Gongcheng, Fuhe, and Duan, money in Guixian and Hechi, gold in Youjiang, Wuming, Daling, and Jiejiang, are increasing in output every year. Therefore, although Guangxi is known as a poor province, the underground minerals and the agricultural crops on the ground are both sources of wealth. If we can recruit technical talents on the one hand and utilize foreign capital on the other hand to engage in development, then in a few years, why is it difficult to turn a poor and barren area into a rich province?</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi Commerce</p>
<p>The commercial construction in Guangdong includes the Tungsten Ore Monopoly Bureau and the Provincial Products Management Office. Tungsten ore production is concentrated in Guangdong, Hunan, and Jiangxi. The tungsten ore used in various countries in the world is supplied by these three provinces, accounting for nearly 70% or more. Its use in manufacturing tungsten steel is important. The Guangdong provincial government considers tungsten to be important for foreign trade and of great importance to national defense, so it is specifically nationalized and implements a controlled policy to prevent merchants from competing freely, causing prices to fall, and profits to accrue to foreign merchants. Moreover, the selling power is controlled by the government, which can adapt to the times and not affect national defense. Since the implementation of the monopoly, the price of tungsten has increased by four or five times to seven or eight times compared with the past. The government uses the profits to carry out production projects, and merchants also enjoy the benefits of increased convenience. The Guangdong government believes that if the provincial factories were to take on both manufacturing and sales, it would not only be distracting but also lead to many drawbacks. Therefore, it has specifically established the Provincial Products Management Office as a sales organization, dividing it into four departments: spinning, cement, sugar, and fertilizer, each with its own responsibilities. The collection and payment of funds are handled by the bank, with each department cooperating and sharing responsibilities, which can avoid malpractices. In addition, the Management Office can also act on behalf of merchants to sell domestic goods. Although the city's commerce is in a slump, it is still better than Shanghai. The China National Goods Company has a turnover of 3,000 yuan per employee, and the turnover of Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun is also not bad. In the future, with the unification of the currency system and convenient remittances, Guangdong's commerce will have even more hope. Guangxi is a province with an import surplus. Its position in foreign trade is equivalent to that of China in the world market. Its exports are mostly agricultural products and raw materials, and its imports are all industrial products or semi-finished products. Wuzhou is located in the lower reaches of the Xijiang River, reaching Qi and Qian upstream, and connecting Hong Kong and Guangdong downstream. Goods come and go through this place, holding the total trade of the province. Its location is the same as that of Shanghai. All cities in the interior of Guangxi have an import surplus to Wuzhou, while Wuzhou has an import surplus to Hong Kong and Guangdong. On the other hand, due to the slump in the world market and the decline of rural Guangxi in recent years, Guangxi's total trade volume has not only failed to grow naturally, but has also declined to some extent. However, the degree of decline in exports is more severe than that in imports, so the amount of the import surplus has increased significantly. In general, an increase in the import surplus does not necessarily indicate economic decline, but in Guangxi, the import surplus not only indicates the depth of foreign goods, but also because the province has no intangible income to offset it, the result of the import surplus is the outflow of silver and the depletion of finance, which is a major obstacle to Guangxi's economic development.</p>

<p>Zhou Shaoqing, a 65-year-old farmer from Zhoujiazhai, Sanlintang, Pudong, had a grandson named Zhou Baixing, 19, who was a habitual gambler. On the night of June 1 of this year, he returned home after losing money gambling and demanded money from his grandfather, Zhou Shaoqing. When his grandfather rebuked him, Baixing became enraged and beat his grandfather. Unfortunately, the injuries were fatal, and Shaoqing died immediately. Baixing fled to Shanghai, seeking refuge at the home of his father-in-law, Zhou Xuegen, at 139 Luxue Lane, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai. His wife reported him to the police, who arrested him and handed him over to the local court. The prosecutor charged him with causing the death of a senior relative through assault and battery and brought a public prosecution. After the debate concluded, presiding Judge Chen Kangsun sentenced Zhou Baixing at 12 noon yesterday for causing the death of a senior relative through assault and battery. Considering that he was under 18 years old, the sentence was reduced according to the provisions of the criminal law, and he was sentenced to six years of imprisonment as a warning. After the sentencing, he was taken back into custody to await the expiration of the appeal period before being sent to prison.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Representatives of Shanghai East and West Slum Dwellers Petition Various Parties Yesterday <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Slum dwellers in the East and West districts of Shanghai have been ordered to demolish their homes within a limited time by the Municipal Council in order to improve the city's appearance. Following a joint meeting, Tang Anping, Wang Gongfeng, Liu Huairen, Hu Yumen, Xu Yiqun, and 24 others were selected as representatives. At 2 PM yesterday, they went to the First Special District Citizen's Association at Tianhougong Bridge to request relief. Chen Jiufeng, the executive member of the association, received them. The representatives stated their intentions, saying that in this time of economic downturn, they have no way to make a living and no ability to return to their hometowns. They have been forced to build sheds as temporary shelters, and the hardship of their lives is self-evident. The municipal authorities should quickly seek to revive the economy and provide relief to workers so that the common people can live in peace. However, the Municipal Council has not only failed to show compassion but has taken advantage of people's desperation, forcing slum dwellers to demolish their homes within a limited time to improve the city's appearance. The news has spread, causing panic among the old and young. They requested that the association uphold justice and advocate for the slum dwellers, asking the Municipal Council to withdraw its order and allow them to avoid demolition in order to reassure the people. They are willing to guarantee that they will not build any more additions in the future and requested that the Municipal Council quickly construct civilian housing so that slum dwellers will have a place to live when landlords take back their land or the Municipal Council builds roads. In this way, the Municipal Council can achieve twice the results with half the effort in improving the city's appearance. Mr. Chen then expressed his acceptance of the representatives' opinions and promised to be responsible for negotiating with the Municipal Council. If it can be guaranteed that no further additions will be built, it may not be difficult to resolve the issue. He asked them to wait patiently and not take any actions outside of the proper channels. The representatives left satisfied. They then petitioned the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, where Secretary Tao Leqin received them and promised to argue their case reasonably and strive to achieve their goals. He also advised the slum dwellers to wait patiently for a resolution. The representatives then went to the Municipal Council to petition, where Director He Dekui received them. He replied that the Municipal Council had tentatively decided to demolish the slum dwellings in various districts, but the overall plan would be decided after further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Lodger Turns Robber: Ms. Ai Ai Robbed; Losses of Clothing, Diamond Rings, and Cash Exceed 10,000 Yuan; Live-in Lodger Also Tied Up and Robbed <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Ai Ai (Fu Wenhao), a famous socialite from Sichuan, was robbed at her home yesterday morning at around 6 AM by four lodgers renting the attic room on the fourth floor, who made off with clothing, diamond rings, and cash worth over 10,000 yuan. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Enjoyed Great Fame</p>
<p>Fu Wenhao, a Sichuan woman, is currently 35 years old. Ai Ai is her pseudonym. More than ten years ago, Ms. Ai was a famous socialite in Shanghai, and she once appeared on the silver screen, gaining great fame. Afterwards, she gradually disappeared from the public eye. However, when people in society occasionally mentioned Ms. Ai Ai, they could all recall her vividly.</p>
<p>Renting Out Remaining Rooms</p>
<p>Ms. Fu currently resides in a Western-style house at 72 Avenue Albert, French Concession, occupying the second floor. Because she has few family members, she rented out the attic room on the second floor to Ms. Li Anna (32 years old) and the third floor to Ms. Huang Chen (45 years old) from Fujian. A week ago, Ms. Fu, seeing that the room on the fourth floor was also unused, posted a rental advertisement in order to save money and attract tenants.</p>
<p>Four Lodgers</p>
<p>The day after the rental ad was posted, two young men in Western suits claiming to be students at the Dapuqiao Political Science College went to rent the room. Ms. Fu thought the young men looked like students and immediately agreed, and they moved in that day. However, two more people came along, making a total of four (three in Western suits and one in Chinese attire). Ms. Fu did not suspect anything.</p>
<p>Robbery in the Early Morning</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, at around 6 AM yesterday morning, when Ms. Fu and the other tenants were still asleep, the four young men on the fourth floor suddenly rushed downstairs. Three of them were holding pistols. They tied up Ms. Fu and each of the tenants and robbed them at will. After about 45 minutes, they fled with their loot without a trace.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Police for Investigation</p>
<p>When Ms. Fu and the other tenants realized that the bandits were gone, they shouted for help. Neighbors heard the cries and rushed over to untie them. They immediately reported the incident to the French police station. The police chief sent Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. It was estimated that clothing, diamond rings, and cash worth about 10,000 yuan had been stolen, with Ms. Fu suffering the greatest losses. The French police are currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>

<p>Notice was given yesterday to all factories to complete their setup by today. The National Goods Exhibition in the Special District at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shilu Road has been extremely busy since preparations began. Participating manufacturers have also been very enthusiastic, as the location is central, the market is thriving, and it is the best in Shanghai. It is a good opportunity to promote the products of each factory and advocate for national goods. The exhibition was originally scheduled to open on the 22nd of this month, but due to incomplete internal arrangements, the date was delayed. It has now been decided to open on the 23rd of this month, and notice was given to all manufacturers yesterday to complete all arrangements by the 22nd in order to open the next day.</p>

<p>550 Nautical Miles from Shanghai; Direction Indicates it Will Pass Outside Daji Mountain</p>
<p>Of the two typhoons that originated in the South Pacific, one has already dissipated, while the other is heading towards the Chinese coast. If its current direction remains unchanged, Shanghai may be affected by the typhoon, and the situation is gradually attracting attention. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, yesterday a reporter inquired with the Xujiahui Observatory and learned that the typhoon originated east of the Philippines (north of Yap Island). At 6 AM yesterday, it had advanced to within a 60-nautical-mile radius of 127 degrees east longitude and 23 degrees north latitude (550 nautical miles from Shanghai, and 360 nautical miles east of Taiwan Island). However, its direction is towards the north-northwest. If this remains unchanged, the typhoon will likely pass outside Daji Mountain near the Wusongkou harbor, and Shanghai may be affected by the edge of the typhoon. The strength of the wind is still unclear.</p>

<p>The China National Goods Maintenance Association had previously requested a preferential rate for industrial electricity from the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, citing the high prices, in order to revive the market and save industry. The Association received a reply yesterday indicating that this was difficult to implement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reply to Maintenance Association</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, We have received your letter requesting a 30% discount on electricity and water rates for Zhabei industries in order to maintain commerce, etc. Our company has always paid close attention to assisting commercial and industrial enterprises. The water rates we set are already lower than those in the British and French concessions. Recently, in light of the economic downturn, we have revised our business electricity sales regulations, reduced electricity prices, and adopted a tiered billing system, which is particularly beneficial to industrial electricity users. We have enclosed a copy for your reference. Regarding the merchant's request, it is difficult to comply due to cost limitations. We hope you will understand and inform the association.</p>
<p>New Electricity Rates</p>
<p>In order to benefit businesses, the company has made the following new rules (1) Electric motors that consumers install, up to 50 horsepower, will be billed on a monthly basis depending on the amount of horsepower connected. Lower prices are available for those who use more electricity with the following rates (a) The first 50 kilowatt hours (kWh) is ¥.06 per kWh; the next 100 kWh (51-150 kWh) is ¥.055 per kWh; the next 100 kWh (151-250 kWh) is ¥.04 per kWh; the next 100 kWh (251-350 kWh) is ¥.03 per kWh, and any kWh over 350 is billed at ¥.025 per kWh. For factories with over 50 horsepower usage, a separate contract will be drawn up and prices can be negotiated (2) Deep-well pumps, irrespective of horsepower or amount used, will be billed at ¥.08 per kWh (3) Electric vehicle charging will be calculated according to the tiered rates listed above (4) Use of alternating current cranes and hoists will be billed according to the tiered rates listed above.</p>

<h3 id="e112">The Two Cases Against Liu Huizhi to be Merged for Trial; If Found Criminally Liable, Liu Will Be Deemed a Repeat Offender <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Liu Huizhi, former general manager of the China Industrial Bank, has been repeatedly criminally prosecuted by shareholders of the bank for embezzlement and breach of trust since his resignation. Recently, five shareholders, including He Jiechun, Weng Pengnian, Yan Xiaoquan, Zhu Ruping, and Yan [], jointly filed a lawsuit against Liu, listing eight instances of Liu's misconduct, involving embezzled funds amounting to as much as four to five million. Two court sessions had been held to summon and question him, as previously reported. Now, because presiding judge Tan Xinzhen found that five of the eight charges brought by He and others were related to the facts alleged in Zhang Chongfu's lawsuit, the criminal part of that case had been temporarily suspended by the presiding judge and transferred to the civil court to resolve the civil issues first. Since He's lawsuit had similarities with Zhang's, for the sake of clarifying the facts, it was deemed necessary to cross-reference them. Therefore, yesterday morning, both plaintiffs and defendants were summoned to inquire about the progress of the civil part of Zhang Chongfu's lawsuit in the civil court. Liu Huizhi's defense lawyer stated that the civil part of the case had already concluded with two trials and was now final. Therefore, the criminal part of the case could proceed, and the civil court's judgments from both trials were submitted for review. Judge Tan then informed both parties that the only matter to be examined today was this, and the case itself would be investigated on a separate date. However, it is said that the court, in order to emphasize procedure and facilitate future trials, intends to merge the lawsuits filed by Zhang Chongfu and He Jiechun for trial. If the defendant is found criminally liable, he will be considered a repeat offender, and separate judgments will not be necessary.</p>

<p>Cultural Groups Performing Non-Commercial Shows; Regulations Do Not Require Licenses</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Society reports that the Public Concession Municipal Council has illegally interfered with the performance of patriotic dramas. The Ant Society's Experimental Small Theater Group sent a letter of protest to the Municipal Council and received a reply stating that it was based on the regulations for music academy licenses. Since the Ant Society did not sell tickets for the performance, the Council's citation of the regulations was inappropriate. Yesterday, they specially requested assistance from Chinese directors Jiang Yiping and Zhang Yichen of the Citizens' Association. The National Drama Association also convened a meeting for this purpose and decided to issue a declaration of support. The Ant Society yesterday also entrusted lawyers Sha Qianli and Yang Tianxun to send a letter of negotiation to the Municipal Council, the original text of which reads: "Dear Sirs, we have received your letter K417 of the 6th of this month, stating that according to Article 8 of the regulations for theater and music academy licenses, all licensees must submit detailed programs to your office before the performance to determine whether the performance complies with the license. The Ant Society, which our clients belong to, is a cultural organization registered with the Shanghai Municipal Government's Education Bureau and filed with the Ministry of Education of the National Government's Executive Yuan and is not a commercial organization. On June 23 of this year, the society gave a dramatic performance as a guest at Lake Society, this was merely an annual event to invite members and their families, in order to strengthen relationships and raise funds, and the performance date was only one day, so it cannot be compared with commercial theaters. Our clients are one of the taxpayers in the Public Concession, and are bound to comply with the relevant regulations within the Concession, namely the Shanghai Public Concession Land Regulations and its appendices, but after searching these regulations, there is no requirement to obtain a license for a non-commercial cultural group like our clients putting on a theatrical performance once a year. Even in terms of Appendix 34, opening a theater requires a license, and since our clients are not opening a theater, there is no obligation to obtain a license. Therefore, Article 8 of the theater and music academy license regulations mentioned in your office's reply cannot be applied to our clients. Furthermore, our clients performed dramas in the Public Concession on June 3, 1934, and June 16, 1935, without obtaining licenses beforehand, and your office not only did not prohibit the performances but also sent personnel to the venue for protection. Your office has completely acknowledged in the past that these public welfare and entertainment performances do not require licenses. This time, you have suddenly prohibited them, illegally imposing restrictions beyond the provisions of the Public Concession Land Regulations, depriving our clients of their freedom to perform, and violating the law. This is beyond belief. Our clients have entrusted us, the lawyers, to lodge a serious protest with your office. As for all the losses suffered by our clients due to your office's illegal prohibition, we reserve the right to demand compensation. At the same time, we hereby notify your office that our clients will exercise the rights of taxpayers on August 2 and continue to perform in the Public Concession, and your office must not prohibit them again illegally. Whether your office can comply with the Land Regulations will be determined by this. We are hereby sending this letter on behalf of our clients, hoping for your attention and a clear reply. Addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council."</p>

Lu and others, dissatisfied, hired lawyers Wu Linkun and Lang Peng to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. After repeated hearings, the final judgment was delivered yesterday morning by Presiding Judge Yu and Judges Nie and Jiang. The main text stated that the original judgment regarding the guilty verdict was revoked, and Lu Xihou, Lu Mengxiang, and Lu Zutong were found not guilty.

<p>The National Society reports that businessmen in the French Concession have long been suffering from the forced power outages and fines imposed by the French Water and Electricity Company. Some believe the amount is small, while others succumb to the power and remain silent. Recently, the Xiaoyao Pond Bathhouse on Xinqiao Street and Zhang Wensheng Noodle Shop on Xujiahui Road were again subjected to unreasonable penalties by the company and suffered grievances. They appealed to the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession for assistance. Yesterday, the Association, based on facts and legal principles, sent a letter to the Municipal Council, requesting that it instruct its subordinates to handle the matter impartially.</p>

<p>Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng was arrested for instigating murder. Dissatisfied with the Second Special Court's sentence of imprisonment, he appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. During the trial period, while detained in the external ward of Guangci Hospital due to illness, he bribed the head guard to smoke opium. He was reported by a prisoner and prosecuted by the French Police Affairs Department, sentenced to eight months' imprisonment. Gu, dissatisfied, appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. Later, the High Court merged the murder case and the opium case for trial. On the 26th of last month, the court ruled that he was innocent in the murder case, but maintained the original eight-month sentence in the opium case. In addition, according to the newly promulgated regulations on prohibiting opium and drugs, he was sentenced to one year's deprivation of civil rights and ordered to quit opium addiction within two months. Subsequently, Gu submitted a petition to the Third Branch of the High Court, claiming that his opium addiction had been broken, with a certificate from a medical officer, requesting exemption from being sent to a rehabilitation center. After the opium case was finalized, he was sent to prison for execution. Gu submitted two more petitions to the Third Branch of the High Court, requesting the court to suspend his personal custody during the appeal period for the murder case and allow him to post bail, and to exempt him from the sentence in the opium case. As previously reported, Acting Presiding Judge Zhu of the High Court held a hearing some days ago, bringing Gu to the court for questioning and informing him of the requested points. Now, it has been learned that Gu, while serving his sentence, had his progress in breaking his opium addiction examined by prison medical officers, who reported it to the Third Branch of the High Court. After receiving the report, the High Court consulted the Zhenru Forensic Institute, requesting them to send personnel to re-examine Gu Zhuxuan's opium addiction to determine whether he had indeed broken it. A forensic officer surnamed Chen from the Forensic Institute came to Shanghai yesterday morning and went to the Second Special District Prison on Avenue Massenet to take Gu Zhuxuan for examination and assessment. The results are expected to be revealed soon.</p>

<p>As previously reported, around 9:00 AM on the morning before yesterday, a fire broke out suddenly at the Xietai Leather Goods Factory at No. 288, Lane 3, Haifang Road, burning to death two apprentices, Chuan Alian (17 years old, from Pudong) and Yuan Haiqing (18 years old, from Ningbo). It has been learned that the Gordons Road Police Station ordered Chinese Detective Cui Jinchuan to investigate and determined that the fire was caused by the two apprentices igniting a bottle of industrial alcohol used to make leather goods when using an automatic lighter. It was also learned that the factory had a total of three rooms, one of which was destroyed by fire, which was where the two apprentices worked. The bodies were taken to the forensic examination institute on Avenue Petain. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang, assigned by the First Special Court, arrived at the institute to confirm the identities of the bodies. He then ruled that the deceased apprentices, Chuan Alian and Yuan Haiqing, had indeed died from burns caused by industrial alcohol. The bodies were handed over to Fu Xuesheng and Yuan Futang, who signed the necessary documents to claim the bodies.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association Building Clubhouse Committee (members: Shen Junru, Jiang Yiping, Chen Tingrui, Sun Zuji, Xu Zuoliang, Yu Chengxiu, Yu Chuiluo, Tan Yigong, Qu Yue, Zha Renwei, Wang Weizhen) submitted a written report to the Executive Supervisory Committee regarding the progress of the committee yesterday. The original report is transcribed below: "Since the committee was commissioned by the Executive Supervisory Committee at the zero-five meeting and established on September 1 of last year, it has actively carried out the work of building the clubhouse, holding a total of thirteen meetings. Initially, it was planned to purchase land separately for construction. Therefore, advertisements were placed to solicit land. Although more than 30 submissions were received, after review, only three locations were considered slightly suitable: (1) Between Weihaiwei Road and Rue Massenet; (2) Behind the Huaan Company on Rue Amiral Bayle; and (3) Rue Luzon. However, due to the high prices during inspections and negotiations, it was difficult to meet the budget. The association had too much debt and could not make a decision. Therefore, it was proposed at the 210th meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee on October 23 of last year that the construction should still be carried out at the original site. Subsequently, according to this resolution, we began soliciting architectural drawings and hired architectural experts Zhang Xiaoliang, Zhang Jiguang, and Jiang Changgeng as architectural consultants to the committee. They attended the meetings. A total of 27 architectural drawings for the clubhouse were received and publicly displayed at the association for seven days. Subsequently, the selections were made according to the legal methods. Only fourteen were selected in the first review, six were selected in the second review, and the selections were reduced to three in the third review. In the fourth meeting, through voting, the drawing prepared by the Dingzhong Engineering Office was selected at the eleventh meeting of the Building Committee on April 9 of this year. It was approved by the 222nd joint meeting of the Executive Supervisory Committee on April 15 of this year. On April 17, the twelfth meeting of the Building Committee resolved to hand over the architectural project details to the original applicant for the tender, so that the project could be advertised. At present, the applicant, Dingzhong Engineering Office, is working overtime to rush the engineering details. According to reports, most of the more than forty architectural details have been completed and will be delivered in the coming days. This is the past work situation of the committee, and a summary report is submitted as above. Addressed to the Executive Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association."</p>

<p>Gu Bingjun (also known as "Big Hook"), a foreman at the Shanghai West Public Welfare Yarn Factory, was suddenly shot and killed in November 1927 in front of the Kouweiyu Sauce Garden in Cunshan Lane, Caojiadu. The perpetrators remained at large for several years. It was not until September of last year that the accomplices of the perpetrators, Yuan Aliang, revealed the matter after drinking, which was learned by the family members of the deceased, Gu Bingsong and Gu Cui. They reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, who, together with Public Concession detectives, arrested the perpetrators, Zhao Chunquan (also known as "Little Overlord"), the chief foreman of the Public Welfare Yarn Factory, and his brother Zhao Bingquan (also known as "Maomao"). They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and handed over to the Shanghai Local Court for trial. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau arrested two more accomplices, Gu Fafa and Lu Xisheng, and handed them over to the Local Court. In the first trial, all four defendants, Zhao Chunquan and others, were acquitted. Prosecutors Tang Ruxiu and Lei Binzhang, expressing their dissatisfaction, appealed to the High Court, listing their reasons. The family of the deceased also hired lawyers Chen Xingmin and others to appear in court. Judge Siwen of the High Court began investigating the case and, after three months of investigation and trial, issued a verdict on the morning of the 20th of this month, overturning the original judgment regarding the acquittal of Zhao Chunquan and others. Zhao Chunquan and Zhao Bingquan were each sentenced to sixteen years' imprisonment, and Gu Fafa and Lu Xisheng were each sentenced to ten years' imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Rickshaw Puller Dies After Fight Over Two Cents in Debt. External Examination of the Body Unable to Determine Cause of Death. Judge Orders Autopsy by Forensic Doctor for Further Review <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Gu Chuncai, a 48-year-old man from Funing residing at No. 10 Yuxing Lane, Gujiawan, Zhabei, earned his living by pulling a rickshaw, but he was not registered with the authorities. Therefore, he was not supposed to pull a rickshaw, but Gu usually waited for others to hand over their shifts and then continued pulling the rickshaw in order to make a living. However, around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Gu was waiting for rickshaws to hand over their shifts on the side of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road with four companions. At this moment, Gu suddenly asked one of the four companions to return the two cents he was owed. A quarrel ensued, followed by a brawl. Gu, being weak, was unable to resist and fell to the ground. The assailant and the other three people fled the scene. Subsequently, Officer 238 of the Dixwell Road Police Station, passing by, noticed the situation. In addition to sending his rickshaw to Tongren Hospital for treatment, he also reported to the police station, which ordered Chinese Detective Fan Defu and Detective Mu Chunrong to investigate the scene. Gu died at 6:40 PM due to the ineffectiveness of the treatment. The body was taken to the forensic examination institute on Avenue Petain. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru, assigned by the First Special District Court, accompanied by two forensic doctors, Wei Zhang and Wang Zuyi, and court clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the institute to examine the body. He then took the bench in the public hall. First, the detectives reported the details of the incident. Then, the deceased's wife, Li Shen, and her son, Da Kouzi, reported to the court, claiming that the deceased had gone out around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon and suddenly died. They requested that justice be served by arresting the perpetrator and bringing him to justice, adding that their family was poor and unable to afford to claim the body. Witness Pan Zhu, a small vendor, testified that she was selling socks near the scene on that day and only saw the deceased wrestling with another person. Later, she did not see it because someone bought something. Because the external examination of the body was unable to determine the cause of death, Zhang ordered the forensic doctor to perform an autopsy on the body and then review the case. Because the family was unable to claim the body, the body was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial after the examination.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Last Month, Three Deaths from Malaria in the Public Concession - Special Circumstances in Shanghai Make Mosquito Eradication Difficult <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's health report for June, malaria was the most noteworthy infectious disease in the Concession that month. Worryingly, three people died from malaria. The increase in gastrointestinal diseases, such as typhoid fever and dysentery, was also higher than the previous month. Fortunately, cholera had not yet broken out, and preventive measures were still being diligently implemented. There were also many measles cases, but the number decreased by fifty-eight compared to the previous month. Although summer had just begun, there seemed to be fewer flies this year compared to last year, but mosquitoes were extremely rampant, especially in the eastern and western suburbs. In June, there were eleven foreign malaria cases, with six residing in the eastern district and five in the Zhaofeng Garden and Hongqiao area. There were twenty-one Chinese malaria cases, with sixteen residing in the eastern district and the rest in the western district. All deaths from malaria were Chinese. Mosquito eradication efforts were more difficult in Shanghai due to conditions different from other major cities. For example, the outskirts of Shanghai were full of rice paddies, and the standing water in the fields was a breeding ground for mosquito larvae. The Public Works Department's release of fish fry into rice paddies was an important part of mosquito eradication efforts, but when the rice paddies dried up, the small fish had to be collected. Unfortunately, farmers often let them die. Furthermore, the pits created when digging foundations for buildings in Shanghai also provided breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. There was no immediate solution to these special circumstances. Among the reported cases of typhoid fever, there were ten foreign cases and sixty-four Chinese cases. Over ninety percent of those affected had not been vaccinated, and the three or four who had been vaccinated had received the vaccine more than two years prior. Therefore, typhoid fever vaccinations should not be neglected. Fortunately, citizens were becoming increasingly aware of this, and the health department was overwhelmed with vaccination requests. It was reported that 47,786 people were vaccinated in mid-June.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read a news item in your newspaper on July 11 in the Shanghai news section, about the case against the director of Puan Hospital, which included the statement that "The defendant confessed that the plaintiff's attorney had also inquired this month and said that the family was in great distress and asked for some money." After investigation, there is no such fact. The defendant did not make any such confession during the court hearing. It is obvious that the reporter's inquiry was inaccurate. As the plaintiff has appointed our firm as the litigation agent, this matter concerns reputation and cannot be ignored. Please publish this letter in the letter column and make corrections as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gu Jirong, Attorney</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in the Shanghai news column of your newspaper on the 20th, that twenty-one stapler workshops made some requests to the World Book Company and sent us as representatives to negotiate, after investigation, this matter is completely fabricated. It is assumed that the interview was inaccurate. Please make corrections in your newspaper as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3 id="e141">Productivity and Consumption <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The most important way to promote and popularize national products is to increase the purchasing power of the general public, and the driving force behind increasing purchasing power lies in the consumption power of the general public. How to ensure everyone has the power to consume means fostering everyone's productivity.</p>
<p>Those living below the poverty line do not have the power to consume, so how can they have purchasing power? After investigating the reasons, it is because of the bankruptcy of rural areas and the underdevelopment of industry and commerce, resulting in everyone lacking productivity.</p>
<p>Because there is no productivity, people can only make do with clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so where is the power to supply consumption? No matter how good or suitable the goods are, where is the power to buy them? Weak consumption power leads to decreased purchasing power, and the things produced have no way out. Cause and effect are mutually generated, as if containing a cycle. Therefore, to enable everyone to have consumption power and purchasing power, we must stimulate the productivity of the general public in the interior.</p>
<p>Recently, the National Economic Movement has focused on promoting national products, especially various sideline occupations in the interior. This is the best way to promote productivity. Farmers spend less than half of the year actually cultivating the land, and the remaining half can be used to develop sideline occupations, increasing everyone's productivity and naturally increasing purchasing power. This is the prerequisite for promoting national products and is worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Hoping that Students Will Work Hard on National Products during the Summer Vacation <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yang Yao's article in the last issue of this journal, I feel very moved by the "Summer Vacation Student National Products Movement". Indeed, in these days of national crisis, especially with severe smuggling, which has put the national economy at risk and caused the entire industrial sector to move towards total collapse day by day, it is extremely urgent and important to propose to students across the country to use their vacation to work hard on the national products movement. At the same time, I believe that students across the country will certainly be unwilling to let the great time pass by in vain in this extraordinary period, but will take this opportunity to do some very meaningful and valuable things. Therefore, they will definitely not hesitate to work hard on and diligently promote this basic work of saving the country—the national products movement.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai National Products Movement United Association hosted the education and news circles last week to discuss the implementation of summer student national products work and established a summer student national products promotion association, which passed its regulations and work outline. This is a piece of news that is worth everyone's joy. We hope that teachers and students in elementary, middle, and high schools across the country will immediately respond to it and expand it. In particular, every student returning to their hometown should pay attention to being able to adapt to the needs of each local environment and carry out their work accordingly. Below, I would also like to write down a few points that I consider most important in the work for reference:</p>
<p>1. In your hometown, work hard to publicize the benefits of using national products and the dangers of smuggling and the harm of dumping foreign goods, using the most alerting words or writing to persuade all the villagers. In the morning or evening, it is best to use the villagers' spare time to hold national products speeches at various public gathering places, such as teahouses, hotels, temples, etc.</p>
<p>2. Conduct a detailed survey of the promotion of national products and the encroachment of smuggling on the country's industrial and commercial sectors in your hometown.</p>
<p>3. Collect various exquisite national product exhibits and hold mobile national product exhibitions in your hometown.</p>
<p>4. Go to various retail stores in your hometown to persuade store owners to sell only national products and no longer import foreign goods to meet market needs.</p>
<p>5. Investigate the comparison of national and foreign product sales and the degree of smuggling prevalence in your hometown. Compile numerical statistics and publicize them to the public locally to raise awareness. At the same time, make detailed records for compilation in the report.</p>
<p>In short, we believe that all the respectable and lovable students across the country will be willing to work hard on this meaningful work of saving the country, and will make the future of the Citizen National Products Year shine with a different color.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Talking About Yixing Pottery <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Wan Naijun</p>
<p>It can be said that the Chinese people do not love and protect domestic products enough, regardless of their size! Now, let's point out and talk about Yixing pottery. Regarding its nature, function, aesthetics, and value, it all conforms to economic principles. These are described below:</p>
<p>There are many types of pottery products, including teapots, teacups, tea bowls, flower vases, flowerpots, antique bottles, tripods, stationery, toys, and so on. Even for each type of product, there are at least twenty to thirty color and size varieties, and as many as forty to fifty. Furthermore, product names such as teapots, flower vases, and tripods are meaningful and mostly historically evaluated. The soil is sticky, pure, and durable, and will never be as easily broken as foreign goods, which are not uniformly made inside and out.</p>
<p>In terms of function, they become antiques over time and are said to be difficult to break. For example, teapots, after many years, can keep water in the pot from ever developing a strange taste! Flowerpots, after a considerable number of years, make it easier to grow flowers and plants in the pot. There are too many to list.</p>
<p>The colors are purple, yellow, dark green, and red. The colors are glossy and bright, especially dark green, which is more valuable. Furthermore, specially made tea bowls and flower pots with broken porcelain surfaces are even more elegant. Regardless of color or size, they are far superior to the ceramics of Western goods.</p>
<p>The price of each product, although there are also expensive ones worth several tens of yuan, of course, these are precious ones; but there are also cheap and beautiful ones starting from one dime. They can be suitable for the strength of purchasing power.</p>
<p>Chinese people: Understand this. Buying foreign goods is not only losing the responsibility and obligation of a citizen. You should also know, why bother to spend your money to bring many guns to hit our motherland for foreign chimneys! No, let's say hitting yourself.</p>
<p>Here I advise my compatriots to happily use the quintessence of national pottery, happily use all domestic products, and not allow rights to leak out; it is also a virtue.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Starting with Promoting National Products <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>Smuggling by ronin has been long-term! The situation is becoming increasingly serious! It has reached the point of having the enemy but not me, having me but not the enemy! Someone in Reading Life said well! Regardless of whether it is smuggled goods or not? We must resist all inferior goods! This can be said to hit the nail on the head. Patriots share the same heart! Hearts share the same principle!</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Sunqing, a celebrity in Wuxi, once gave a broadcast speech on the issue of suppressing smuggling, entitled "Understanding of Anti-Smuggling Should Be Had", paying attention to "promoting national products to save the country", saying that "the responsibility of anti-smuggling should not be borne solely by the government, the nature of smuggling incidents is extremely serious! It is related to the survival of the country! Therefore, all citizens should share this responsibility. However, in the past, any mass movements, such as boycotting goods, were generally lacking in strict organization and out of emotional impulse. Therefore, they are not lasting, nor very effective! It is hoped that the people of the country will be of one mind on anti-smuggling in the future, with strict organization, and start with promoting national products..." Mr. Huang Yanpei also said that "to promote national products for the sake of saving the country, not for the purpose of promoting sales and profits, but to promote national products". The sages have the same insightful views. I believe that we should "start with promoting national products" anytime and anywhere. Do not regret not using national products earlier, and gnaw at your navel afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="e145">National Product Fruit Juice <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Hui Jian</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "All diseases enter through the mouth," especially in summer. Many types of epidemics are mostly transmitted through unclean food and drink! Therefore, we must pay special attention to this, such as watermelons, fruits, ice cream, and sour plum soup displayed on street stalls, because there are germs left on them, so they should not be eaten.</p>
<p>Boxed ice cream and bottled soda are cleaner, but most of them are foreign goods. Promoting them too much will inevitably waste national currency!</p>
<p>However, on such hot days, people inevitably need to drink beverages at any time. If they drink unclean beverages, they are in danger of contracting cholera and epidemics. Drinking foreign soda and fresh orange juice will cause rights to leak out.</p>
<p>Want to solve this problem of quenching thirst? Then I will introduce the various fresh fruit juices specially made by the Wuzhou Pharmacy, which are made with high-quality fruits and distilled water. They taste delicious, quench thirst, and generate fluid. They are economical and hygienic, killing two birds with one stone. This is a national product beverage worth promoting.</p>

<h3 id="e147">The Olympic Torch Relay Begins: Solemn and Grand Ceremony Reaches Unprecedented Heights; Expected to Arrive in Bulgaria on Thursday <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Athens, July 20th (Reuters) – The first ceremony of the Olympic Games, the lighting of the sacred flame in ancient Olympia, commenced today. After the flame was lit, the 3,000-mile torch relay race across six European countries also began. The final runner will arrive in Berlin on August 1st, the opening day of the Games, to light the Olympic fire.</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM this morning, the flame was lit using sunlight, and twelve maidens carried it to a special altar, chanting Pindar's Olympic oath. The first runner, a resident of Mount Olympia named Condylis, repeated the oath once more. After lighting his torch from the flame on the altar, he began the first stage of his journey. Each runner will run approximately one kilometer. More than 3,000 runners will participate, and the relay is expected to reach the Bulgarian border on Thursday.</p>
<p>King George of Greece also attended the solemn ceremony at the Olympic stadium, which was lavishly decorated to welcome the participating runners.</p>
<p>Unprecedented Grandeur</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, July 20th, Ancient Olympia – This morning, crowds thronged the road to the Temple of Ars to witness the torch relay. The torch relay, from Mount Olympus to the Berlin Olympic Games, began at 10:00 AM this morning. The first torch was lit using a concave mirror to focus sunlight. Long before the start, students from various schools, government officials, and other spectators had gathered at the designated locations to wait. The commemorative plaque presented by Baron de Coubertin in 1934 was also hung beside the Temple of Ars. A special altar was built next to the temple, where the first relay runner began his run.</p>
<p>Baron's Speech</p>
<p>This morning, Baron de Coubertin, the founder of the Olympic Games, delivered a speech at the start of the torch relay here. He briefly stated that fifty years ago, he planned a youth education system, but he firmly believed that political or social methods were inferior to physical education methods. Hence, this great movement was initiated. "Physical training not only makes a great contribution to public health but also greatly helps in personal outlook on life. The most notable effect is making young people smile often, thus conquering difficulties becomes effortless."</p>
<p>Bishop's Blessing</p>
<p>While celebrating the first torch relay race at Mount Olympus, Earl de Coubertin recited a speech and led the athletes in taking the Olympic oath. Following this, Bishop Apikagos stood up to give a blessing, saying, "May God's will, which is the light of the people, follow this torch to Germany. Furthermore, may the spirit of Christianity be transmitted to the friendly German people. At the same time, may the burning of this torch represent the enthusiasm of the world's national athletes in their pursuit of God's glory."</p>
<p>Berlin Celebrations</p>
<p>National Maritime News Agency, July 20th, Berlin – This afternoon, a grand gathering was held in the Berlin City Hall to celebrate the start of the torch relay in ancient Olympia.</p>
<p>Dr. Lewald, President of the Olympic Organizing Committee, presented a beautifully carved wooden torch to Berlin Mayor Lippert, expressing gratitude for the Mayor's contributions to the preparations for the Olympic Games. Subsequently, the Greek flag was raised in the main hall of the City Hall, and the Greek national anthem was played. Other athletic events were participated in.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Grass Court Tennis Doubles League: Conaty Club Wins Championship; Completely Defeated South Grass Court 15-0 Yesterday; Chinese Team Wins Championship for the Second Time <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>——Japan Club Ranked Second——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Conaty Athletic Club completely defeated South Grass Court with a score of 15-0, thus winning this year's Shanghai Grass Court Tennis Association Doubles League Championship. Conaty played a total of 104 sets, winning 74 sets. The Japan Club, which is second to Conaty, still has a match against Portugal. The Japan Club currently has a score of 56 points, so even if they completely defeat Portugal, they would only get 71 points. Conaty used Yan Rongsheng, a veteran tennis player who recently returned from the Soviet Union, making their strength even more substantial. It is noted that the Chinese team has only won the Grass Court Doubles League Championship once, in 1931. Afterwards, the French Business Club continued to maintain it for two years. Unexpectedly, at a time when talent is scarce this year, they were able to win the championship, which is very commendable. As for Conaty and Portugal, there is still one set that has not been played, but it is no longer relevant to the overall situation, so it has been abandoned. The results of yesterday's game are as follows:</p>

<p>London, July 20th (Reuters) – In today's Davis Cup Inter-Zone Final held at Wimbledon, Australia is already leading Germany 2-1. Australia originally planned for Quist to play late, but because of an ankle injury, the decision to replace him with McGrath was only made before the start of the match. The singles match against Henkel tomorrow will inevitably be hindered.</p>
<p>Today's game was interesting but lacked brilliance. Crawford's strategic hitting method enabled the Australians to win. Australia is now leading 2-1. In the last two singles matches, they only need to win one to seize the ruling power against Britain. The results of the first two singles matches are as follows: Crawford defeated Henkel 6-2, 6-2. Kramm defeated Quist 4-6, 6-4, 4-6, 6-4, 11-9.</p>

<p>The National Committee for Children's Welfare, initiated by the host organization of the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, the three ministries of Interior, Education, and Industry, and the Department of Health, was formed after the conclusion of Children's Year. A draft of "Organizational Regulations for the National Committee for Children's Welfare," consisting of fourteen articles, has been prepared. A discussion meeting was held at the Ministry of Education on the 20th to discuss this draft and other related matters. Present were Wu Shizhong and Chen Lunmin from the Ministry of Interior, Tang Jianfei and Fan Shouzang from the Ministry of Industry, Zhu Zhanggeng and Jin Baoshan from the Department of Health, and Gu Shusen, Lei Zhen (represented by Zheng Yanghe), Wu Yan Yin, and Xue Tianhan from the Ministry of Education, totaling ten people. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yan Yin, and the following decisions were made: (1) After the conclusion of National Children's Year, it was unanimously agreed that there was a need to establish a permanent organization to address the welfare of children nationwide. (2) The draft organizational regulations for the committee should be revised, and the Ministry of Education was requested to revise it and send it to the various departments for review. (3) Regarding children's welfare initiatives, work should begin in the Beijing area, using the remaining funds of over ten thousand yuan from the National Children's Year Implementation Committee over the past year to fund children's welfare projects in Beijing.</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the revision of the organizational regulations, those present unanimously advocated for three key points: (1) In terms of organization, the Ministry of Education should be the primary organizing body, with the Ministries of Interior and Industry and the Department of Health playing a participating and jointly organizing role. (2) The committee should have one full-time Secretary-General and several full-time staff members. (3) Expenses should be jointly borne by the three ministries and the department, with extreme frugality in administrative expenses, and the majority of funds should be used for children's welfare projects.</p>
<p>The tasks of this Children's Welfare Committee are fourfold: (1) Promoting children's education; (2) Addressing children's health; (3) Protecting and providing relief for children; (4) Organizing, guiding, and improving children's welfare organizations. Once the three ministries and the department jointly approve the organizational regulations, and each appoints personnel and invites several committee members with expertise and experience in children's welfare, the committee will be formally established.</p>

Now that the government is focusing on forests, how could the school abolish the forestry department? Therefore, it was unanimously decided that the Chinese Forestry Society should petition Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Education to order the university to pay attention to forestry. More than ten people, including Ling Daoyang, Li Yingong, Hui Jikuan, Yao Chuanfa, Pi Zuoqiong, Chen Rong, and Liang Xi, jointly wrote to Dean Wu, requesting that he jointly value forestry.</p>

<p>Unauthorized Use of the Name of Engineering School for Enrollment; Strict Crackdown If Not Corrected</p>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Education, due to the China Wireless Radio Engineering Training Institute's failure to comply with bureau orders and unauthorized use of the name "Engineering School" for enrollment in newspaper advertisements, causing confusion among young people, issued a special order to the school, stating that the registered name of the institute in the bureau is the Shanghai Private China Wireless Radio Engineering Training Institute. However, the institute has been using the name "Engineering School" externally. The bureau has previously sent personnel to correct this. However, recent newspaper advertisements for enrollment by the institute still unauthorizedly use the name "Engineering School." This is a blatant violation of bureau orders and causes confusion among young people, which is highly inappropriate. The institute is now given three days from the receipt of this notice to revise the enrollment advertisements. If such incidents occur again in the future, strict punishment will be imposed. Compliance is expected. It is reported that the Municipal Bureau of Education has recently noticed that various supplementary schools, two-session schools, and training institutes in the city frequently fail to comply with the Bureau of Education's regulations and unauthorizedly change the names approved for establishment or registration. Some even use the name "XX Vocational School" in newspaper advertisements. All such cases will be strictly cracked down upon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for each month suddenly changed drastically.

The situation was naturally surprising at first glance, but it was normal in the speculative market. Because the current inventory of each factory is sufficient, selling began with the August contracts. It is rumored that the outside bull group had broken apart. The initial price was still one dime and two cents, but sellers were very active and the price fell continuously. The August price closed at only 3.0825 yuan. The prices for September and later months also uniformly plummeted from the second round, with December being the most severe. The closing price was only one dime and three cents, a drop of eight cents from the fixed limited price, and it seemed to fall by more than one dime compared to the dark market a few days ago. By the time the afternoon market opened, the current month could no longer resist and slightly dropped by half a cent from the limited price. The sentiment for August to November remained poor, and the prices fell another one, two, or three cents. Fortunately, bears actively covered, and prices rebounded slightly. From this, it can be inferred that the market's rise in the past month was mostly driven by speculation. Now that the situation has changed and unexpectedly turned downward, it is a good sign after the previous high prices.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Slight Decline in Wheat Prices <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was generally calm after the opening in the morning. Although foreign wheat quotations from Chicago rose by three, four, or five cents, and Canadian quotations rose by four or five cents, the market sentiment was poor because grain merchants, considering the excessively high standards, were actively hedging their physical stocks. This is the environment that should have existed in reality, which the profit-seeking bulls naturally did not expect. Therefore, the market sentiment for each month was flat. By the time the afternoon market opened, the market sentiment for each month remained soft, but the decline was not very large, with a maximum of eight or nine cents. If the rumors of a flour bull breakup are true, the subsequent situation is likely to be repeated. Currently, the wheat market sentiment is stable, and the opening prices for each grade are similar to before: Kai Mingguang Shaheji Guandian Wheat is 4.55 yuan, and Daqiao Wheat is 4.45 yuan. Fuxin handled 5,000 bags, and Shenda and Fufeng handled 1,000 bags each.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Active Arrivals and Sales of Ke Xian Rice <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of Ke Xian rice were very active, and the market continued to be strong. However, the strong arrivals still controlled the rising trend. More than 20,000 bags arrived in the past few days, and more than 10,000 bags arrived in the past two days. With strong arrivals, it is difficult for the rice market to rise. Fortunately, the current sales of local Ke rice are exceptionally active. If the future supply slightly decreases or the sales volume increases further, the price will also need to rise. Yesterday, 4,243 bags of various Jiangxi rice, 1,201 bags of Hunan rice, 300 bags of Sha rough rice, and 63 bags of Anhui rice were released, and were distributed by local, Benjie, Beiyang, Xiamen, and Ningbo traders. Local traders had the most greed, and the rice they and the Ningbo traders took were of medium and lower quality. Beiyang and Xiamen traders took Hunan rice, while Benjie traders picked the high-end rice.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from various traders still only arrived at the 13th and 14th (a total of 2,600-2,700 piculs). The sales market on Benjie Street was slightly worse than before, with only the Nanyang traders moving 200-300 bags, so the market situation turned flat. However, Su Tong Japonica and Nangang Changbang and other goods, especially those of high quality, were really scarce and were still marked up by 5 cents to 1 dime. Medium-quality goods were flat. Bo Dao was also a done deal. Du Yangjian had no honor or disgrace. Bian Yuan goods were scarce and fresh.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, goods arrived from the 16th and 17th from the He Xia and other routes. The various sales channels in the market were sluggish. The market price of white japonica slightly decreased by nearly 1 dime, and Bian Yuan also fell slightly by one-four cents. The price of Bo Dao was weak, and the price of Yin Yuan and Bu Ke Jian fell by seven-eight cents. The arrival of Yang Jian was still strong, and the high price was close to 1 dime. Medium-quality goods fell by 2 dimes, and the price of other goods was generally weak.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Yarn and Cotton: Bulls Selling off in Large Quantities; Decline of Old Cotton is Frightening; Market Prices Plummet Without Turning Back; July-August Prices Fall by 2.5 Yuan; The Effect of Restricting Trading <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The price of old cotton in the cotton market plummeted, with a sharp decline. After the cessation of new trading, the market lacked balanced trading volume. At the same time, rumors were rampant, and the yarn market continued to decline. Market confidence weakened, and bulls sold off in large quantities. Market prices then trended downward, with the July-August prices falling sharply by 2.45 yuan to 2.75 yuan. The decline of new cotton was slower.</p>
<p>The Decline of New Cotton is Slightly Slower</p>
<p>In the forward market for marked cotton, although American cotton rebounded by 11 to 15 points, Indian cotton fell sharply by 1.5 to 3.75 rupees, and Osaka's three-grade cotton erroneously rose by 2 yuan. This was later corrected by telegram, so there was no change. Market confidence was mediocre, and the opening prices for July-August old cotton fell by 9.5 to 8 dimes, and new cotton fell by 1 dime. The momentum of old cotton was still weak, and new cotton fell sharply by 2.3 dimes. At the close of the third session, the decline of old cotton intensified, and the prices for distant months did not change. The reason for the sharp decline was the large-scale selling by various parties. As a result, old cotton fell by 1.3 to 4.5 dimes compared to the previous day's closing price, and new cotton fell by 4.5 dimes. In the afternoon opening, the price of July-August old cotton gradually decreased, falling straight down without turning back. This situation was frightening. As a result, the price of the July-August contracts fell by 1.1 to 3 dimes compared to the morning closing price, and new cotton rose by 5 cents to 1.5 dimes. It was learned that Jifeng sold 2,700 dan, Chengji sold 3,700 dan, Meiji sold 2,000 dan, Tongji sold 3,100 dan, Mingde sold 3,000 dan, Hexing sold 3,800 dan, Shenji sold 3,200 dan, Dachangcheng sold 4,300 dan, Changfeng sold 4,900 dan, and Dachang sold 2,000 dan, Daji sold 2,600 dan.

<h3 id="e184">After the Sharp Fall in Old Cotton, the Yarn Market Also Becomes Unstable; Prices for Each Month Fall Below 10 Yuan; The Trend is a Straight Decline <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the decline continues to intensify. The prices for each month are falling in a straight line because rumors are rampant in the market. After the military understanding in Guangdong, financial stability led to a large number of sellers, and bulls suddenly closed out their positions in bulk. The market price then fell without support. However, current yarn trading is gradually improving. At the close, the price rebounded slightly by 6-7 dimes.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn Declines are Stronger</p>
<p>In the forward market for marked yarn, the prices for each month varied, fluctuating by 3-5 dimes. In the second session, due to the instability of old cotton and the securities and financial sectors selling off in large quantities, Dachangcheng, Yichang, Changfeng, Mingde, and others sold off one after another, leading to an overflow on the table and a sharp decline. The prices for each month fell by 1.7, 8, and 9 dimes. The second and third sessions remained weak, and rumors continued to spread, saying that a certain important person was being transferred to Guangdong Province, and many parties lacked leadership. Retail sellers became increasingly eager to sell. At the close, the decline remained strong. Except for December, the prices for all months broke through the 10-yuan mark. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 1.7, 9 dimes, and 2.8 to 3.9 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the sharp price drop in the morning caused some profit-takers to buy back in. The prices for distant months rebounded by 3-4 dimes. In the second session, rumors did not stop, and prices still fell by 6-7 dimes. By the time of the close, it was heard that current yarn trading had improved again, and Tianjin and Guangdong traders were buying a lot, rebounding by 6-7 dimes. The closing result was that the current month fell by 6 dimes compared to the morning closing price, and the distant months rose by 2, 3, and 4 dimes. It was learned that Dafu sold 7,450 bales, Mingde sold 1,350 bales, Senkang sold 2,850 bales, Fengtai sold 1,550 bales, Yuanyi sold 2,150 bales, Dachangcheng sold 6,350 bales, Yichang sold 2,200 bales, Changfeng sold 4,400 bales, Yukang sold 800 bales, and Dachang sold 800 bales.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. The prices for each month fluctuated by 1-2 points, and there were not many sellers. Then, as fellow traders and Liverpool bought, the market price rebounded. It was reported that 20,000 bales of stockpiled cotton were sold on Saturday, leading to hedging in the market and bulls closing out positions. However, this was absorbed by Wall Street purchases. Some believe that the bulls have finished closing out their positions, and the market is now entirely dependent on hedging. The current cotton spot prices are extremely firm, and textiles are quiet and soft. Before the close, bull closing and cotton farmer hedging led to renewed weakness. Spot prices rose by 15 points, and futures prices rose by 10 to 15 points. English cotton spot prices fell by 9 points, and futures prices fell by 3 to 8 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to large-scale bull closing and futures traders selling, but later rebounded due to large-scale purchases by European exporters and spot traders. Pingguoer fell by 1.5 to 3.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 2.5 to 3.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 2.75 to 3.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 20th).</p>

The price for cotton futures rose by 5.5 to 9 dimes, with the near month at 70.05 yuan and the distant month at 65.45 yuan.</p>

The HSBC Bank's listed price announcement was flat for both British and American currencies. Although the price rose at this time, it was still limited.

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced a sudden and dramatic change in market conditions. Initially, due to positive sentiment, the long positions were firm, forming a short squeeze. Market prices rose sharply, with Class A bonds for the current month breaking through to a new high price of 69 yuan 2 jiao, reaching 69 yuan 7 jiao. Because many short positions were swaps, the forward market prices were inverted in each round. Subsequently, rumors of instability emerged during the day, and the long positions exited, causing a large drop. Market conditions changed rapidly. High market prices are particularly prone to unexpected declines. Due to the approaching settlement, it is said that the Sichuan bankers have temporarily stopped using legal tender, and may also exit the market. Yesterday's process began with extremely high morale. Everyone believed that the environment was peaceful, and many remained firm and unmoved. The short positions panicked again, hedging or swapping positions one by one. Therefore, the recent surge was particularly strong. Except for numbers 4, 35, and 48, most buyers were retail investors. The market price improved by 2-3 jiao to 8.5 jiao. Class A bonds for the current month reached a new high price. The forward market was less strong, with each item showing inverted prices. In the first round of the afternoon auction, morale remained firm. Types E and D rose by another 1.5 to 4.5 jiao. When auctioning Type C, number 4 suddenly changed its style and tended to sell. Those who followed included numbers 11, 14, and later 13 and 47, etc., all selling one after another. Type C was suppressed by number 4, and the forward market turned down by 3.5 jiao. The Type B forward market even fell by as much as 7 jiao. Type A also fell by more than half a yuan. Market sentiment changed very quickly. The trend was that the continuous short squeeze may turn into a long squeeze. As a result, market prices varied greatly. The Type B forward market fell by 1 jiao, while the Type D spot market rose by 1 yuan and 5 fen. The rest mostly improved, rising by 1.35 jiao to 6.8 jiao. The total volume of transactions was 11.127 million yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of raw yarn for the near month was falling. However, the cloth market was able to maintain its position due to thin inventory. Sentiment has already seen downstream effects, and sales of all goods were very stable. East Asian fine cloth, fine twill, and market cloth also showed a recovery of 2.5 fen per piece. The market for fine cloth and fine twill from this factory was quite strong due to the strong demand from the Yangtze and Cantonese merchants. Yesterday, the Cantonese merchants bought more than 500 pieces of fine twill for next month's futures for each brand, as well as more than 30 boxes of straight tribute, serge, crepe, etc. spot goods. The Changsha merchants bought more than 200 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from this factory. More than 100 boxes of printed straight tribute serge and printed cloth, etc., from factories such as Lun Chang. The Sichuan merchants bought more than 100 pieces of Lun Chang's "Heroic Figure" blue cloth, Dacheng blue cloth, etc., as well as 70-80 pieces of serge, straight tribute, crepe, etc. Sales were also seen in Wuhu.

<p>Yesterday, transactions in wool were almost non-existent. The prices of goods did not fluctuate significantly. However, old fat leather in rough rice yellow color has been selling exceptionally well recently, showing signs of a renewed interest from tailors. As a result, the market price suddenly rose by 2-3 jiao. In addition, there is a shortage of goods in the market, and new goods are very scarce this summer. As a result, after a day of popularity, they were almost completely collected. There is a shortage and prices have soared. Fat leather that was initially sold for 2 yuan and 4 jiao per yard is now selling for 2 yuan and 7.5 jiao. Rice-colored ones require an additional 1 jiao. Those in the trade who have stock are quite regretful that they lack it.</p>

The Japanese firm Abeshi Yoko set the price for 20 boxes of 150 "Gold Three Horses" brand glossy rayon at 126 yuan, excluding tax. The goods were loaded immediately. Japanese 120 rayon spot goods are extremely scarce. The "Tianqiao" brand is priced at 430 yuan. There are no "Sun Beauty" brand goods. The "Tiantan" brand is 425 yuan. A total of 25 boxes were sold. The price of Italian 120 rayon also turned high. The 2 number "Sine Ai" stack order is priced at 115 yuan, and the spot price is 395 yuan. The 3 number stack order is priced at 110 yuan, and the spot price is 390 yuan. A total of more than 50 boxes were sold. Also, Japanese prices have risen again. Both 120 and 150 "Tianqiao" brands are priced at 135 yuan, for delivery in Shanghai this month.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Fine Eyebrow Green Tea Sales Slightly Slow <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market was slightly quiet. European firms have all taken a wait-and-see attitude due to the recent outbreak of war in Morocco. Yesterday, a total of more than 970 boxes of black and green tea were traded. Sales of fine eyebrows saw a decrease of 3-4 yuan. Sales of needle eyebrows saw a decrease of 1-2 yuan. Transactions in Qi Duo black tea were particularly slow. However, British and Russian firms have shipped no less than 5,000 boxes of black tea, flower tea, and other goods in recent days, which is quite strong compared to before.</p>
<p>According to a report from the Tea Industry Association, transactions in fine eyebrows from various regions were still not numerous yesterday. However, Tianyu bought a total of more than 400 boxes of fine eyebrows from Yushan and local merchants. Mid-grade Tun Wu fine eyebrows were 75-76 yuan, and high-grade were more than 80 yuan. Yihua Jinlong and other firms had sporadic transactions. Bai Tou firm was still able to offer 104 yuan for high-grade Wu Zhen, but the goods were quite rare. Transactions in needle eyebrows priced at 30-40 yuan were considered quite good. It is said that the Gui Xi Wen Xie Association also intends to start buying, so the future is still optimistic. Due to mismatched prices offered by foreign firms, large merchants of Pingshui tea have not been able to transact this week, with only Gai Lu Zhen Mei Xiehe purchasing about 200 pieces at a price of 31 yuan to 33 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was slightly flat. The association's plate for 24 coarse sugar white spot goods was called at 22 yuan, and transshipment goods were 6 yuan 8 jiao, with no increases or decreases. East White 489, as well as local factory soft white, Zhenji Jinxin Dahua, etc., were all called at the original prices without changes. Guangchao merchants offered dozens of bags of ordinary Zhiyang white at 14 yuan 6.5 jiao, as well as 200 bags of Huaguang Red at 14 yuan and Sub Red at 13 yuan 8 jiao. Also, more than 100 bags of Huizhou Red were 13 yuan 2 jiao, 2 jiao higher than the previous day. It is said that Shantou exchange rates have slightly recovered, with the morning telegraph at 1,226 yuan. The previous day's price of 1,200 yuan was only a reported price from the buyer, and did not actually reach 200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e195">North-South Goods - Haikou Branch Goods Sold Out <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>New wood ear fungus in the Hankou market had previously risen to 93 yuan, then fell back to 88 yuan. It has tightened again in recent days, with yesterday's telegraph at 92 yuan, up 3-4 yuan. New Sichuan ear fungus had been offered at 110 yuan, but there have been no recent arrivals. The airline brand small package ear fungus is called at 100 yuan, with other prices slightly lower.</p>
<p>A total of more than 1,600 boxes of Haikou branch and Shuidong branch arrived on the previous Qingyuan wheel. Due to active sales recently, most were offered at the original plate prices. Some of the staggered ones had slight changes, with lower grades increasing by a few jiao. All were opened for sale. However, the asking price for Shuidong Haikou flat branch turned down due to sluggish sales.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Metals  Westhay Iron Price Soars <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Westhay iron is selling well in this port.  A considerable amount has been offered on the market, and standard asking prices are rising steadily due to insufficient supply.  The current market price is 33 yuan per box.  Large boxes of thin gauge iron can fetch as much as 34.5 yuan per box.  Yesterday's market saw transactions of 400 to 500 boxes, but inventories are remarkably low, boosting confidence.  Moreover, overseas prices soared to 8 gold yuan yesterday, an increase of 4 gold jiao from the previous level, further encouraging holders to hold onto their goods.</p>

<p>— (Ming Ran)</p>
<p>Human Behavior  One can compare the Abyssinia to the sheep, Italy to the tiger, and England and France to the fox!  The cicada and the weaver bird can be compared to China, the tirelessly working ant can be compared to Germany, the American dollar diplomacy can be compared to the praying mantis... Perhaps one can think of another country, but what about the snake!</p>
<p>In the summer, men and women who are good at swimming can be compared to the amphibious frog—blood-sucking mosquitoes can be compared to usurers, flies that disturb the peace can be compared to vagrants—</p>
<p>People pursuing urban careers, whether they are graduates or unemployed students, can be compared to bees and butterflies!</p>
<p>The hardworking farmers in the fields can be compared to the water buffalo dragging the plow—traitorous and depraved collaborators, self-inflicted harm, can be compared to moths flying towards the fire at night. People who enlighten and guide society can be compared to fireflies flashing their lights in the summer night, preventing people from getting lost and wandering astray!</p>
<h3 id="e198">On Mosquitoes <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Some old fellows who like to talk about the current situation often compare the current situation to malaria, and from malaria, they talk about the scourge left by mosquitoes, and advocate wiping out mosquitoes, which is already more than half the way to thinking about the problem. Now, my discussion of mosquitoes is of a different nature.</p>
<p>In fact, mosquitoes use their stingers to bite people, but they don't always cause malaria. According to the analysis of pathology, there are two kinds of mosquitoes, one is the common mosquito, with the Western name Culex, and the other is the malaria mosquito, with the Western name Anopheles. In our vulgar eyes, we only know that the buzzing flying creatures are mosquitoes. They are extremely evil, and should be killed without mercy. We will never let them bite on our skin and then study them carefully. But since the Western devils have taken the trouble to identify them, our compatriots, for the sake of fun, may as well be happy to know some readily available information.</p>
<p>With a little attention, they can be distinguished, because when malaria mosquitoes perch on a wall, their heads face the wall and their tails face outward, in a diagonal position. When common mosquitoes perch on a wall, their heads and tails hang straight down, parallel to the wall. The wings of malaria mosquitoes have patterns and spots, and their bodies form a straight line from the proboscis to the tail. The wings of common mosquitoes are transparent, with patterns but no spots, and the shape of the body, head, and chest is bent, forming an obtuse angle with the abdomen. When it comes to the movements of malaria mosquitoes, they only appear in the dark at night, taking advantage of the fact that people cannot see them or are asleep, to plunder blood and fatten themselves. They fly very low, with a ghostly air. They are sinister and perverse, making people afraid. They not only plunder people's nourishing elements, but also transmit a kind of malaria protozoa, MallaliaePlaxmodium, into human blood, destroying the tissue of blood cells, which is as hateful as troublemakers disrupting order. As for common mosquitoes, although they also suck human blood, their attitude is better and does not cause great disasters.</p>
<p>If we are to judge and punish according to the crime, we will of course only punish malaria mosquitoes.</p>
<p>However, Chinese compatriots mostly harbor a kind of "virtue of loving life," walking with their heads down to avoid trampling ants to death, so they let the mosquito larvae in stagnant water grow and change naturally. When they themselves are bitten painfully, they slap them to death, thinking that it is a karmic retribution. If they do not die and fly away, they think that the mosquito's life should not be cut short. However, Westerners have a stubborn prejudice, advocating "killing all mosquitoes." Smart people think to themselves: isn't this still the stupid thing of "the Foolish Old Man Removing the Mountain"?</p>
<h3 id="e199">University Student's Home <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>In a lane of twelve shikumen (stone gate) houses, the most eye-catching is the university student's home, which is in the last two-story house. In the lane, when this shikumen is mentioned, people never say someone's surname or mansion, but always say "the university student's home."</p>
<p>The university student's father is a speculative businessman. The university student is his father's only son. His father has been quite successful in speculation for many years. Originally, nine families lived together in the two-story house. Since he made a fortune four years ago, he drove away the other eight tenant families and lived there alone. Once poor people have money, everything is different. They don't care much about their neighbors. At that time, the university student had just graduated from middle school. His father had money anyway, so he decided to send him to a certain university. The neighbors, seeing that his family gradually broke off contact with the surrounding neighbors, became too lazy to say someone's surname, and then called it "the university student's home."</p>
<p>Speaking of this university student's home, it really made the neighbors in the other eleven shikumen houses half envious and half jealous. In the two-story house, there lived only the university student's parents and the university student himself, but they employed five people, including a rickshaw puller, a nanny, and a maid. These servants also ate big fish and meat every day. What did the master eat? Naturally, it goes without saying. In short, the superiority of their life was something that no family in the entire lane could hope to achieve even half of.</p>
<p>Three years passed quickly. In a speculative market storm, the university student's father gambled again and again, not only losing everything but also incurring a lot of debt that could not be repaid, and went bankrupt. A notice of seizure was pasted on the door. The family took a few blankets and temporarily took refuge in a pavilion in House No. 8. To make matters worse, the university student's father became ill from anger and anxiety and died. After a hasty funeral, the mother and son faced each other with furrowed brows, at a loss. The university student was no longer as carefree as before. After living there for three months, the university student could not find a job, and the mother and son returned to their hometown alone and forlorn.</p>
<p>However, in a shikumen at the end of that lane, even though another family now lives there, the people in the lane still call it "the university student's home."</p>
<h3 id="e200">Germs <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shan</p>
<p>One person was about to eat food that flies had landed on, and another person advised him, "Don't eat that food, I'm afraid it has microorganisms on it!" The fool said, "You say there are microorganisms, why can't my eyes see them?"</p>
<p>The above story is really a joke. The morphology of germs is extremely small, and it is definitely not something that human eyes can see. Only when viewed under a microscope with staining can the dots and curves be clearly presented before our eyes. But precisely because it is a minute object that cannot be observed by oneself, people often suffer its harm in carelessness.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of microorganisms. Just talking about infectious bacteria, there are dozens of kinds. For example, "tubercle bacillus" will cause tuberculosis, "cholera vibrio" will cause cholera, "meningococcal coccus" will cause meningitis, etc. According to the investigation of the Health Work Department, these infectious bacteria kill tens of millions of people every year!</p>
<p>However, although the harm of infection is severe, the effect of prevention is also great. In recent years, domestically produced bactericidal agents include "Yalin Zishui" and "Yalin Shaer" (produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy), one specifically for watering walls and corners to eliminate places where microorganisms accumulate, and one specifically for bathing and washing to prevent indirect transmission of bacterial toxins. This can also be said to be a formidable enemy of microorganisms.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Thoughts on the Reprint of Imperial Incense Drifting Record <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>A reprint is just a reprint, what is there to feel or not feel?</p>
<p>In fact, it is something that every person engaged in writing cannot help but have! Because when we write a book, it is really like giving birth to a son, and it is both father and mother, taking on both roles, making it even more laborious than giving birth to a son. When it is completed and published, we have even more expectations and hopes for it. Fortunately, it is praised by some people and actually gets reprinted. Tell me, how can we not have some feelings?</p>
<p>This time it's my turn! Although my works have been reprinted more than just this Imperial Incense Drifting Record, the situation this time is a bit different: first, because the market is still sluggish, especially in the publishing industry, and Imperial Incense Drifting Record can be reprinted immediately after the first edition in two months, it can be said to be a very rare thing; second, the structure and style of this book are very special, both the original and the translation are like this. Whether this special flavor is suitable for modern readers, I had absolutely no confidence at the beginning. Now, although I dare not say it has been successful, it has not been a complete failure. It is indeed a bit lucky to have this result after the first attempt. So when Mr. Ma Yinliang, the manager of Shenbao, notified me that it would be reprinted immediately, I really had a mix of surprise and joy in my heart.</p>
<p>I was surprised because the content of this book is really not very perfect, and the translation is especially mediocre. If it is spread indefinitely, it will really lead to "good things don't go out the door, but bad things travel a thousand miles!" I was happy because I like this kind of novel very much, and others don't seem to hate it. It's just that I'm still planning to continue to introduce one or two works by Deling, and this will increase my courage a bit.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Swapping the Nest with the Luan Phoenix <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Sight and Hearing Are Not Floating Dust, Reassuring Reply Sent, Life and Death Can Be Generous, Expressing Sadness in Poetry</p>
<p>He bowed deeply to his mother and said, "Please rest assured, Mother, I will definitely not delay my studies." After saying this, he took his textbooks and hurried out. As he was leaving, he heard his mother tell the maid Zhou, "I knew he was very anxious, afraid of delaying his studies. But he was afraid of making me anxious, so he didn't say a word. Later, the meal should be earlier, don't let him worry." Guoshi listened, and a kind of gratitude he couldn't express came over him. He thought that his pursuit of a young lady was something his mother didn't expect. It's good that Jiang Mailan rejected my request, so that I wouldn't be so distraught. With this thought, he didn't go around the bend to meet Miss Jiang, but took the direct road to school. If he couldn't get her reply, then there was no need to wait for her reply. In this way, he cooled down his thoughts for more than a day. When he came back for lunch that day, he saw a letter on his desk. The letter had his name on it, and the postscript said "details inside." Seeing the beautiful handwriting, it was clearly a woman's handwriting. Before he even opened the letter, his heart was already pounding. So he slowly took the letter in his hand, first sat down on the chair, and calmed himself down. Then he opened the letter. It was just an ordinary eight-line letter, which read:</p>
<p>To Mr. Litian's esteemed seat: Having read your letter, Mother and I are frightened. Lan guards herself like jade, and rarely associates with others. Although she often reads great articles and admires you as a contemporary author, there are many suspicions, and she dare not regard you as a close friend. Moreover, our family rules are strict, and we adhere to the style of books. In the remaining years of hardship, I only have the pain of many difficulties. These twists and turns cannot be fully explained in a single letter. I hope you, a gentleman, will cherish yourself and not implicate others in sin. I am very fortunate. My tender heart is turning a hundred times, and I cannot complete the writing. I send this reply specially, and wish you well. Jiang Menglan bows again.</p>
<p>In these eight lines, there was also more than one line of blank space, with a small line added above, please do not send any more letters. At first glance, he felt that he had been rejected by someone. (51)</p>

<h3 id="e203">The Internationally Mysterious Yokohama <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>From our country to Japan, the first port is either Nagasaki or Yokohama. The most overseas Chinese from our country live in Yokohama, so the relationship with our country is the deepest. Moreover, European and American ships all use Yokohama as the docking port for Japan, and people from all countries who pass through Japan must disembark in Yokohama once to listen to and appreciate some oriental interests, so Yokohama has become an international port since its opening, until now. It is said that when the envoy from our country went to Japan, he also brought guards and attendants, advancing with the same shouts and clearing the way as in his own country, and the Japanese had to avoid and disperse. The difference from the current situation is like heaven and earth. Even with unequal treaties, Japan has also concluded many. To this day, there are still leased lands of various countries such as Britain and France in Yokohama City that have not been recovered. Although they are not like the concessions in our country, they occupy them without paying taxes.</p>
<p>When foreign ships dock in Yokohama, foreigners mostly go ashore to visit and buy some things. The nearby Japanese vendors often transport goods and peddle them on the ships, and the decks and corridors become their temporary shops. The goods are mostly daily necessities, rayon silk, and toys. The shops on the streets also rely on foreign customers as their only patrons, so the goods in Yokohama City are transformed by the psychology of foreigners. The most numerous are antique shops, postal shipping companies, and international exchange shops. There are also more rickshaws than in Tokyo, and foreigners often sit on the cars with their long legs to play. They don't want to use it as a means of transportation, but to try oriental tastes.</p>
<p>Yokohama's night is mysterious. There are countless exotic hotels in the city, all maintained by foreigners. After foreigners go ashore, most of them are unwilling to return to the ship, so they stay overnight in hotels. The boredom of long-distance travelers can be eliminated in dance halls and hotels. Prostitution and secret occupations are very developed in Yokohama City. Dacaoying is full of dance halls, cafes, and hotels. These women can all speak fluent foreign languages, including English, French, German, and Russian. Many of them are veterans who have been to Shanghai and Paris and have experienced the world, and they are very skilled in dealing with foreigners. Last year, it was reported that a foreign professor at a university in Tokyo was filming a pornographic movie in Yokohama, which was a leak of a wisp of spring light.</p>
<p>Since there are so many foreigners staying in Yokohama, the nationalities and races are extremely complicated. Unscrupulous foreigners are also learning to do mysterious business. Tokyoites who like mystery all rush there by car and train. The gambling dens, brothels, and hotels are all better than in Tokyo. Yokohama seems to be another world, indeed a mysterious international port. Otherwise, why can things that are not available in other places be openly available in Yokohama? Recently, three beautiful foreigners were discovered who dress up like women all day long and go in and out of the revolving halls, not to mention another pornographic incident.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in Yokohama are all honest merchants. Nanjing Street is full of Chinese restaurants. The cabinets are full of wine pots, warm pots, shark fins, and dried scallops. Foreign tourists and Japanese people like them very much. And in the grocery stores, even my old-fashioned palace powder and sacrificial tin foil are available, truly all-encompassing. These pure merchants, who do not enter the mysterious vortex, are very admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Words of a Back Scrubber <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Among them</p>
<p>Every time I go into the bathhouse to wash up, the back scrubbers always run up to me with twelve points of hope; but because I don't need it, they finally retreat with eleven points of disappointment. Recently, because I accidentally burned my hand on an alcohol lamp, I went into the bathhouse, and the back scrubber came over, so I didn't let him be disappointed again.</p>
<p>While the back scrubber was scrubbing my back, he chatted with me, so I asked about their living conditions. Now, I will record a passage of the back scrubber's conversation as follows.</p>
<p>"Sir: this bowl of rice of ours is really not profitable. It seems that we get a dime for scrubbing a customer's back, but in fact we only get four cents, and the boss takes six cents. There are more than a dozen back scrubbers in the bathhouse. On average, each person does more than ten businesses a day, which is extremely good, so at most we can only get half a yuan a day. Some people have no choice and secretly tell the customers to give the dime directly to the back scrubber. If the boss knows about this, the rice bowl will be broken immediately. So careful people dare not. Furthermore, business is not as good as it used to be. The biggest reason is that there are too many massage parlors and co-ed baths. There are almost massage places on every street. They also shout big prices for competition, such as bathing, back scrubbing, and beautiful women for only half a yuan. You think, going to the bathhouse, the most exquisite thing is to spend half a yuan, and now they only have half a yuan, everyone is willing to go there! Because no man doesn't like women touching him all over, and our business has been taken away by the massage parlors. Alas, now it's really a woman's world, women have all the advantages!"</p>

<h3 id="e205">What You Should Know About Gonorrhea – Common Sense for Choosing Medicines <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Special article by Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is caused by the rampant growth of a kind of coccus, and is purely transmitted by unclean sexual intercourse. It is the most stubborn venereal disease. Therefore, every neglect by the patient, or being misled by quack doctors, or being deceived by inferior medicines, can cause the danger of urethritis, orchitis, prostatitis, and cystitis. It is common sense in treatment, which is not known to everyone. The most likely to fail in treatment is to apply the frustrating therapy in the acute phase. Although the acute phase is the most painful period for the patient, it is also an excellent opportunity for the patient to be treated, which should not be missed. If the treatment is proper at this time, one can get rid of the sea of suffering, because at this time, the gonococci are still clustered in the front part of the urethra, and it is not difficult to use the power of medicine to wipe them all out. However, because there are too many kinds of inferior medicines sold on the market, patients do not know what to do. Recently, there are also doctors who have not graduated from school who sell non-specific medicines with the words "last success" to appeal to patients. This kind of medicine is very misleading, because every time I diagnose a disease, most of the patient's descriptions are that they were misled by this kind of inferior medicine, which caused the condition to worsen. Some even have their disease erupt and develop complications after taking this medicine, and some have their acute disease turn into chronic disease after taking it. Since the successful treatment of gonorrhea with internal pigment preparations, the inferior medicines left in the medical field are all being eliminated. Cunning and hypocritical drug dealers, in order to maintain their last gasp, are still desperately touting their effectiveness, trying to make a final struggle. Patients with weak medical common sense often cannot distinguish them and follow their trap. We doctors can only remedy the situation afterwards. If we want to prevent it before it happens, we must see how well the patient can distinguish.</p>
<p>Recently, since Dr. Jadassohn of Germany carefully studied and made an internal preparation "Ant淋" (Antilin) with pigment penetrating vaccine, there has been a startling success in the treatment of gonorrhea. The drug contains the great achievements of yellow pigment (Cacridin) derivatives and a large amount of (Vaccin) vaccine, which can increase the patient's resistance, so the excellent results are in line with our ideals. As a medicine to study its preparation, it has gathered the first-class and a large amount of (Vaccin) in the medical field. It is truly an excellent medicine for gonorrhea without any side effects, does not harm the intestines, does not stimulate the kidneys, and can penetrate the membrane to kill bacteria. In the shortest time, it will wipe out the gonococci in one fell swoop. All chronic gonorrhea, orchitis, urethritis, prostatitis, and women's gonorrhea, chronic pyelonephritis, can be quickly cured by the great power of "Ant淋". The ingredients contained in the drug are all prepared by Dr. Jadassohn of Germany after testing and confirming their effectiveness in the laboratory. Every ingredient has its medical value, which is not comparable to inferior counterfeit drugs, so patients should specify the real "Ant淋" when purchasing and taking it, and must not be misled by counterfeit drugs to cause themselves sadness!</p>
<h3 id="e206">Root Treatment of Spermatorrhea Due to Weakness <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>No matter how strong a man is, once he is addicted to the bad habit of masturbation, it is difficult to get rid of it after a long time, and the disease of spermatorrhea is inevitable. The characteristic of this disease is that sperm will flow out vaguely in dreams at night. If the disease worsens, it can even flow out without dreams. Also, it can flow out after being slightly touched by erotic feelings or excessive physical labor during the day. The patient will inevitably be physically weak, listless, and feel palpitations and depression. Recently, I received a letter from Mr. Jiang of F煦 Road, who told me: I suffered from severe hemoptysis, which caused my face to be sallow and my figure to be thin. Later, although the hemoptysis was cured in many ways, I suffered from weakness due to excessive blood loss. This spring, I suffered from spermatorrhea again, and my weakness became even more unbearable. A friend introduced me to Dr. Zhan Nianzeng, a venereal disease expert, who prescribed "希答脫氏固精片" (Hitatol's Sperm-Strengthening Pills) for me. In less than two months, the spermatorrhea was completely cured. At that time, Dr. Zhan also introduced me to purchase "生殖素" (Reproductive Essence) from the Chinese and Western Pharmacy to replenish my weak body. Now, I have seen improvement. Not only is my will stronger than before, but my qi and blood are also full, and my spirit is full. The miraculous effect of these two medicines can truly be praised.</p>
<h3 id="e207">The Process of Curing Bone Pain <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The disease of bone and joint pain is very common among Chinese people, and almost all elderly people suffer from it. Examining the disease of bone pain, it mostly arises from the internal accumulation of wind and dampness and the incomplete removal of residual toxins. Furthermore, it is caused by syphilis and gonorrhea. If the medicine is not comprehensive, it is difficult to cure. Furthermore, unclean blood and arteriosclerosis are also the main factors contributing to bone pain. The arteries of the human body must be soft and elastic. Once they harden, they can easily cause numbness throughout the body, joint pain, tendon pain, and limb contracture. If they are not cured in time, they will suddenly fall to the ground and suffer from stroke, which can cause neurological and speech abnormalities, and even hemiplegia. Some people even die from it, which is a common occurrence.</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Xie Yunping came to complain of bone and joint pain and numbness in his hands and feet. Moreover, Mr. Xie was already in his forties. Although he had not reached old age, he already felt hunched over and had difficulty walking. According to him, his bone pain had been around for several years. Every time the seasons changed, it would flare up more severely, even to the point where he could not lift his hands and feet high. I observed that Mr. Xie was actually caused by the internal accumulation of residual toxins, so I treated him with Strong's "骨痛片" (Bone Pain Pills). After taking three boxes in a row, not only were the toxins and madness removed, but also the bones and joints were relaxed, and the tendons were smooth. Even during the changing of seasons, he did not feel any pain at all.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Sweeping Away the Gloom Between the Sexes <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Enhance health... to protect the foundation of happiness between couples. Instill knowledge... to eliminate sexual dysfunction between the sexes. Thorough research... how to keep the youth of men and women forever.</p>
<p>The most important thing for the foundation of a couple is the health of both parties. Only when both parties have healthy bodies can they form a happy family life. Otherwise, there will never be good results, and may even lead to bad results.</p>
<p>Whether it is the man or the woman, if there are any defects found in the body, it is indeed containing major dangers. Modern couples should earnestly check their own bodies carefully. For men: such as sexual dysfunction, neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, bad habits, physical weakness, and contagious venereal diseases. For women: such as irregular menstruation, weakness and infertility, and neurasthenia, which are also common diseases in women, should be cured as soon as possible. This not only affects the happiness between couples, but also has a direct relationship with one's own life. Secondly, if there is sexual dysfunction, one should not get married.</p>
<p>Some people have no signs of sexual dysfunction before marriage, but once they get married, they begin to feel sexual dissatisfaction. This is because there was already a tendency for sexual dysfunction long before marriage, and then excessive sex or mental disorders after marriage suddenly appear. If one still ignores it, the danger will become more and more serious. Examining the causes of this disease, the most important is masturbation and gonorrhea, which destroy the reproductive glands. Over time, symptoms such as headaches, tinnitus, insomnia, and palpitations will inevitably erupt. And lower back pain, mental decline, and difficulty avoiding. At the same time, brain power, memory, and memorization are all slow. The only remedy for this disease is the "生殖素" (Reproductive Essence), a good medicine made from the reproductive gland extract, which can strengthen the reproductive glands and promote the function of metabolism, so all spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia can be cured with medicine. For women, it is appropriate to take female "生殖素" (Reproductive Essence) to adjust menstruation and make it easier to give birth. After taking it, the woman's buttocks and breasts will develop fully, and her health and beauty will be revealed. If men and women take it regularly, it can prevent diseases and maintain youth, making it a rare tonic for men and women.</p>
<p>Common Sense for Self-Treatment</p>
<h3 id="e209">"Germinal" has surprising effects on weakness and smoking cessation <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>For those who are physically weak and have a long-standing smoking habit, seeking a safe way to quit is indeed extremely difficult. Therefore, many who attempt to quit smoking relapse midway, ruining their efforts. However, "Germinal" has proven to have a special effect in quitting long-standing smoking habits, because it has nourishing ingredients that can continuously increase the body's ability to resist toxins. This kind of great medicinal power is truly rare. By reading the experience of a smoker who quit below, one can understand a glimpse of its medicinal power.</p>
<p>Tao Jiaxiong is from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, and is currently forty-two years old. He has been smoking for twenty years. I asked him about his attempts to quit smoking, and he had tried more than fourteen times, with the longest period being four months, but all ended in failure. The main reason for the failure was physical weakness and various illnesses. In recent years, due to age and the deep-seated smoking habit, his physical weakness has increased, and he has found it more and more difficult to quit. This year, after business failure, his finances were suddenly strained, and he had to make a do-or-die determination to quit smoking. Using the method of nourishing while quitting smoking, he took "Germinal" with unwavering determination. In the first two weeks, he only felt that the amount of smoking was gradually decreasing, but his spirit was not weakened. After another two weeks, he felt a dislike for smoking, reducing from four times a day to twice. Before two months, he gradually reduced to complete abstinence. There was no pain during the process, but he initially felt slightly unnatural. Therefore, he also injected "Yu Wei Si Bao Ming" several times, and finally achieved complete success. Now Mr. Tao has not smoked opium for half a year, his body is plump and strong, his spirit is invigorated, his appetite has increased, and his weight has increased from 90 pounds to 119 pounds. The nourishing effect of "Germinal" in quitting smoking is like this.</p>

<p>When a patient is introduced by a famous doctor or an experienced friend to purchase a famous medicine, there are often unscrupulous people who try their best to persuade them to buy other inferior medicines, falsely claiming that they can replace the famous medicine, in order to sell and profit from it through deception. There must be a conspiracy behind this, which we will not expose for now, but please pay attention to it. When purchasing, you should firmly insist on what you want, absolutely adhere to your purpose, and not be tempted. Then, no matter how dangerous the conspiracy is, you will not fall into it. Otherwise, medicine is related to health and life. Wasting money and delaying treatment is a serious loss, which can only be understood by those with discerning eyes.</p>

<p>(1) Three Years of Gonorrhea Successfully Cured</p>
<p>Patient: Ou Wenhua, male, 27 years old, from Hubei, has been working in the tobacco industry in this port for four or five years. (Chief Complaint) — Chronic gonorrhea, has lasted for three years, although many treatments have been tried, it cannot be completely cured. Now I feel unwell and get dizzy and tinnitus after a little work. (Medical History) — Mr. Ouyang came to Shanghai in the winter of the 20th year of the Republic of China to take office. In the late spring of the following year, he was persuaded by a friend to spend the night with a prostitute, which led to gonorrhea. However, due to face, he dared not announce it publicly, and only secretly purchased inferior medicines. This continued and delayed, turning from acute to chronic. Now that it is summer, it is very inconvenient. After consulting with his close friend, he came to me for diagnosis. I observed that in addition to gonorrhea, he was also suffering from neurasthenia. I knew that it would be difficult to achieve significant results without considering both aspects. I immediately prescribed a prescription and instructed him to purchase "Anti-Gonorrhea" from Taihe Pharmacy, which was made by infiltrating pigment into Vakesin to treat his chronic gonorrhea, because this medicine is necessary to cure it completely. At the same time, I prescribed "Germinal" to treat his neurasthenia and specified that he must firmly insist on purchasing this medicine to avoid mistakenly taking inferior medicines. In less than two months, the gonorrhea that had been lingering for three years was completely cured. He said: "If I had known about this magical medicine earlier, why would I have suffered for three years?"</p>
<p>(2) Multiple Diseases Make Smoking Cessation Difficult</p>
<p>Patient: Bao Wangshi, female, 36 years old, from Jiaxing, Zhejiang, has been living in the French Concession of this port for fourteen years. (Chief Complaint) — Amenorrhea, leucorrhea, sallow and thin face, heavy smoking habit, frequent stomach pain, difficult to quit, repeated use of smoking cessation drugs, completely ineffective, and even aggravating, physical strength is insufficient, so her husband accompanied her to my clinic to seek smoking cessation. I instructed her to purchase the gynecological holy medicine "Female Germinal" from the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company to nourish and quit smoking, regulate menstruation and treat diseases, and externally use "Leucorrhea Relief" to eliminate inflammation and purify leucorrhea, and then use the stomach pain holy medicine "Stomach Pain Relief" to control her stomach pain. Now all her diseases have been cured, her spirit is sufficient, and her smoking habit has been safely quit. According to Bao Wangshi's own description of the quitting process: she did not feel any hardship at all. After taking "Female Germinal" for less than two weeks, she automatically felt a dislike for smoking. First, the amount of smoking was sharply reduced, and then completely quit.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Japanese Military Exercises and the Order to Study the Classics <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>In the Shen Bao of the 19th, the following two news items that echoed each other appeared in the same place: One was a report that the Japanese army in Tianjin would conduct large-scale exercises at Nanda Temple for five days starting on the 19th. "160 Japanese cavalrymen, 4 cannons, and 160 horses arrived at Nanda Temple by special train. At 9 o'clock, another 180 infantrymen, with 6 machine guns and 3 heavy military vehicles, also arrived at Nanda Temple on the 41st express train." The other was a report that "the Jizheng Council issued a notice to the two provinces and cities of Ji, Cha, Ping, and Tianjin, ordering all primary and secondary schools to add the study of classics," which is expected to be implemented when school starts next semester. These two news items published together are actually a perfect satirical picture.</p>
<p>The issue of "studying the classics" has been going on for a long time in China. In the past, when Tianjin was in a critical situation, we saw in the newspapers that the Jizheng Council ordered all civil servants in Pingjin to study the "Four Books and Five Classics" outside of office hours. The meaning of this story need not be explained further. It is truly a case of "Sima Zhao's heart is known to all." Now the Jizheng Council is doing this "elegant" thing again. When we see it, we feel an unusual stimulation on our nerves.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the same place, on one side, tanks and cannons are conducting large-scale military exercises on our land, while on the other side, people who are too "relaxed" are calmly and attentively chanting "poetry says, Confucius says." This is a rare comedic farce in ancient and modern times, but it is also a heartbreaking tragedy. Not long ago, Xiao Zhenying, who held an important position in North China, held a large-scale birthday celebration for his father. The traffic was heavy, making it the first grand event since the "Beijing government." For a time, the commercial market in Pingjin was lively, and there was a sense of "peace and prosperity," as if the world was at peace. An ancient poem says, "The merchant girl does not know the hatred of a fallen country, and still sings 'Backyard Flowers' across the river," which can be compared to the situation at that time. Now the Jizheng Council's order for Pingjin schools to study the classics is in the same vein. We really cannot but thank Xiao Zhenying and his generation for their painstaking efforts to help the people of Pingjin forget the greatest pain they are currently suffering and live in peace and contentment.</p>
<p>However, the current pain, although we can try our best to forget it, but reality is most likely to play tricks on people, and it will give you a greater stimulation from time to time. What will happen then?</p>
<h3 id="e214">School is on Holiday <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Laoxin</p>
<p>School is on holiday. The semester exams are over.</p>
<p>Obligatory teacher Xiao Chen is as busy as Sun Wukong, wishing he could have three heads and six arms out of thin air. His responsibility is the full authority of the academic affairs office. The scores of more than 200 students have to drain his dry brain, and there are also the orders issued by the school's "three giants": In order to ensure the increase in the number of students in the next semester, quickly organize a "student achievement exhibition" and prepare a "fun fair" to connect with the parents of the students and communicate feelings. So—— and so on, by order. Our Mr. Xiao Chen is even busier. He jumps around all day, from the school office to the classroom, and from the classroom back to the place where he sleeps—— to put it beautifully, it is: the teachers' dormitory. In that dormitory, which does not see the sun all day and is not much better than a dungeon, he flips through the reference materials he has accumulated over the years, preparing for all this, all this.</p>
<p>The school office has become a market. The students' small heads are constantly rising and falling, and dozens of pairs of small eyes are eagerly and greedily staring at the place where the scorebooks are hung. Perhaps in their little hearts, they are jumping, anxiously and fearfully wanting to know their grades in the shortest possible time—— pass, or fail. Mr. Xiao Chen's head is a little dizzy, and his eyes are a little blurry. Seeing this pile of small heads, he feels like the waves in the sea—— no, to be more precise, it is the small watermelon that he often longs for that can quench his boredom and thirst! So, without paying attention, his hands and brain become uncoordinated, and the beads on the abacus do not listen to his command! Wrong. Enduring his temper, he has to catch up again. The calendar on the desk opened its mouth and smiled mockingly at him—— for two meals a day and a place to sleep at night, he sold himself out like this. —— Damn it, hurry up, tomorrow, tomorrow……</p>
<p>"Tomorrow?"</p>
<p>He was startled. —— Tomorrow is parents' day. The meeting will start at 2 pm, and by that time he will have to finish all the scores, and—— the fun fair; the singing program prepared for the students; the scene "Autumn Sun" directed by friend Zhou; singing performances; costume speeches; ventriloquism; one-man show…… Also, the students' grades; drawings, handicrafts, compositions, and questions and answers for each subject.</p>
<p>His brain became confused. Recently, his neurasthenia has brought him a bad temper. He also thought—— is it really for two meals a day and a place to sleep at night that he has sold all his time? Look——</p>
<p>The principal's lover, a middle-level class teacher, with a strangely ugly face, is playing the piano and singing—— "Good baby, special… fast, ya ya ya ya……"</p>
<p>What a nauseating lewd tune. There is also a group of teachers—— all relatives of the emperor, they (with a her) are joking and laughing softly. If they were seen by the new school of lyricists, they would inevitably praise—— "School affairs, who cares!"</p>
<p>As for the principal and the imposing director of general affairs, they are quite energetic, but the place where they put their energy is different from Xiao Chen. They try their best to win over, or even bribe, the students, decorate the exterior of the school, and plan—— to enroll 400 students next semester, 12 oceans per person, 4 times 4 equals 4, 4 times 2 equals 8, 4,800, how comfortable. However——</p>
<p>"I, Xiao Chen, am busy from morning to night, for two meals a day and a place to sleep at night. Damn it, fuck your ancestors for eighteen generations!……"</p>
<p>Sometimes, Mr. Xiao Chen really wants to give up all this, although the demon of life often shows him a hideous face. However, when his eyes fall on the apple-like faces of these children, his anxiety slows down, and his resentment disappears. He often says to himself—— for them, sacrifice yourself.</p>
<p>He cheered up again to calculate the scores. A large pile of apple-like faces slipped through his eyes. They and she, thanks to him and his two friends' efforts in the past few months, have emerged from the money hole of the merchants, and are lively jumping and calling under the sunlight of nature. Although—— he, Xiao Chen, and those two friends are living in a life without sunlight all day long.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen, come! Watch our last rehearsal and see if the arrangement is familiar?"</p>
<p>So, he dropped his work again and came to the library to watch them rehearse. When he saw them performing the solemn scene where the father sadly shot his little traitor son, he was also moved. He patted their small shoulders:</p>
<p>"You are working hard! Ask Mr. Zhou to arrange a few more plays for you next semester."</p>
<p>"Mr. Chen," a very weak voice asked Mr. Xiao Chen in a low voice: "I heard that you will not be teaching here next semester, is that true?"</p>
<p>The sudden question shocked Mr. Xiao Chen. He knew about this small disturbance himself. Everything in front of him was dark, he seemed to see that the little achievements of his efforts over the past few months had turned into soap bubbles, and soon it would be blown away by the harsh environment, and he shed a few tears. He raised his legs and walked out of the library, and he heard the buzzing crying behind him.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Lotus <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>I have wanted to write an article about lotus flowers for a long time, but I finally haven't written it. I even told a friend about this idea in advance, so when he jokingly said, "The lotus flowers are about to wither," I was really ashamed.</p>
<p>I'm afraid the earliest flowers I saw were lotus flowers. In the yard of our house, I don't know when, there were four neat lotus tanks. Every summer, more than a dozen flowers would bloom, both red and white. Although I was very tired, I didn't see fat lotus flowers when I was a child, so I was always very happy.</p>
<p>In fact, lotus flowers are not beautiful. Their only advantage is "big". Planted in a tank, they are messy and uneven, and the "composition" between the flowers and leaves is really not good, not to mention that there are countless red mosquito larvae swimming in the lush water above the mud. But the reason why I finally like lotus flowers is of course ridiculous to say, but there is no way. I like lotus flowers because their petals can be coated with flour and fried; so as soon as the lotus flowers in the yard bloom, I will immediately artificially scatter them.</p>
<p>I really understood the benefits of lotus flowers when I was sixteen years old. There was a garden near our school. The garden was almost abandoned. The grass grew very high in summer. As soon as we entered, we heard the sound of insects singing in the grass. After walking a few more steps, a large pond lay across our path; this pond was more than ten feet wide and about half a mile long, so a slight breeze could already cause some ripples. On both sides of the pond, there was a row of tall willows, and there were no other miscellaneous trees, which shows that the owner was very extraordinary at the time. A small bridge with railings lay flat on the water. The color of the bridge had already turned gray and black. At the time, I thought it was probably vermilion. Near the bridge surface of the pool, there were a few sparse floating locust leaves, and a little further away, there were some lotus leaves. If we looked further into the distance, a quarter of a mile of the water surface was completely occupied by lotus flowers, and there must have been at least two or three thousand flowers. They were all pink, and bursts of fragrance came in waves, making people feel drunk. Near the bridge, there were also one or two lonely blooms, and the shadows of the clouds and the light of the waves made them look more clear and beautiful. At this time, I began to understand the beauty of the word "graceful" to describe the lotus flower, and then the summer vacation began.</p>
<p>It was autumn, and the cicadas in the tall willows dragged their intermittent remnants. I took the heart of the old tour and went to visit this pond of lotus flowers again. It was really "without seeing the garden, how can you feel the autumn light is so much?" (Forgive me for learning a sentence from Miss Du Liniang's "Returning Soul Record") As soon as I entered the garden gate, I felt that the shade of the tall willows had thinned a lot, and there were already fallen leaves of paulownia on the pebble path. Suddenly I walked up the small bridge and looked forward. At that time, almost all of the two or three thousand lotus flowers had fallen. In the middle of the continuous green canopy, there were only dozens of lotus seedpods, still with one or two petals of residual flowers that had not been taken off, but the tantalizing light red had turned into a pitiful pale white. At this time, I suddenly thought of the two lines of words by Li Yu, the lord of the Southern Tang Dynasty, "The fragrance of the lotus seed pod disappears, the green leaves remain, and the four winds cause sorrow between the green waves." The breeze is still rippling on the water, one is still adding beauty, and now it is "intentionally creating sorrow." Mr. Wang Jing'an explained that these two lines of words mean "all the flowers are dirty, and the beauty is late in life." If you haven't seen the above</p>

<p>I haven't seen that pond of lotus flowers for eight or nine years, and I haven't even seen the potted lotus flowers in the yard for three or four years. The letter I received from home said that the potted lotus flowers in the yard had long since stopped blooming, and only grew a few thin and pitiful leaves every year. And that lotus pond, probably, was abandoned along with that garden; only those few willow trees must have grown taller.</p>

<p>— Zhifu</p>
<p>May 20th, the birthday of the Dragon King, according to custom, a water dragon is performed on this day, and the streets are more lively than usual.</p>
<p>Sanli Temple—that quiet rural town. Today, I don't know who started it, the sound of gongs woke people from their dreams early in the morning. The whole town was noisy, and even a wild dog would jump up crazily.</p>
<p>In the west of the town, in the open space near the Dragon King Temple, two water dragons, so brilliantly arranged and neat, were surrounded by a large group of dark-skinned men, and the situation seemed very tense and serious.</p>
<p>A Gui is a middle-aged warrior, tall, and has innate superhuman strength. Because of this, he has gained some prestige in the town. In the past, during the Dragon performance season, he would act as a gunman (1), always taking the lead, carrying the heavy spearhead on his shoulder, taking big strides, from this side to that side, blowing a loud whistle, personally leading that very rude crowd, and directing their movements, just like bravely killing the enemy in battle.</p>
<p>Because of this, he gained public admiration, and the annual peace tax (2) was gradually taken over by him alone. Each time, tens of thousands of large coins could be rolled into his pocket without hesitation, and he regarded the Dragon King Festival as a patented business.</p>
<p>This year, A Gui did not give up his right and continued to be the initiator.</p>
<p>But the years have been barren! Since the sound of the gong in the morning, he has routinely carried a rattan basket door-to-door to collect donations. Nine out of ten households are like this; he has to repeat thousands of times to satisfy his desires.</p>
<p>Indeed, the years are getting worse and worse! But who would have thought that it would affect the "peace tax" he controls...?</p>
<p>"A Gui! We always donate 880 cash, this year... this year we can only rely on Grandpa Dragon King... 550... we..." That was Mao, the shopkeeper of the distillery, pushing back at A Gui:</p>
<p>"Uncle Mao! A Gui has the most refreshing temper, here! 770... it's considered a share for the brothers!" With a peaceful smile, A Gui argued with him:</p>
<p>"660!"</p>
<p>"Promotion..."</p>
<p>"We have to wait until next year! If the years are good next year... we'll make up for it... ha, how about that!"</p>
<p>A Gui no longer asked for an increase, entered it in the donation book, waved his hand and stepped into the door of the food store—a more deserted and quiet shop.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper, Zhu Hushizi, was meticulously sweeping up rice crumbs and wheat husks.</p>
<p>"I'm bothering you, this year is peaceful and prosperous... I hope Grandpa will bring in more goods and make more money..." A Gui flattered:</p>
<p>"300 coins... please enter it in the book!" Zhu Hushizi twisted his face, showing a bitter smile, glanced at him, and handed over a pile of copper coins that had turned clear yellow.</p>
<p>"Please promote!... Grandpa."</p>
<p>"This is already the price of a liter of rice!..." He stared resentfully, his eyes looking at the rice grains in the basket, his voice as low and hoarse as a mosquito:</p>
<p>A Gui was moved by that hoarse voice! He also stared blankly at the rice in the granary, and it took him a long time to recover. Once a year! Grandpa... Alright.</p>
<p>"Barren year..." the boss finally spoke sadly, followed by a heavy hum:</p>
<p>They looked at each other... barren year... a liter of rice... peace tax... in the two brains, the same thing was repeated countless times.</p>
<p>A Gui could only slip out of the shop lightly——</p>
<p>Similarly, after donating dozens of households, the weight of the rattan basket still did not increase, and A Gui was too bored; he recalled the convenience of donating in previous years, only this year, it was barren!</p>
<p>His heart was depressed, and his steps became slow and seemed to be shackled, so heavy and sour. The sound of gongs in the distance was still shaking.</p>
<p>When passing through a quiet and deep alley, A Gui cursed heavily! —— Cursing that "barren year": "Fuck her mother!... Grandpa Heaven." Note (1) Gunman The old-fashioned water dragon is equipped with a water gun, and the person who points the gun is called——the gunman.</p>
<p>(2) Peace Tax Each household pays the tax, which can ensure peace. This donation is given to the people in charge of the water dragon, and it is also regarded as their labor cost when disasters occur. The township is commonly known as "Peace Tax".</p>

<p>We sell our songs everywhere, we offer our dances everywhere. Who doesn't know that the nation is about to perish? Why are we treated as mere courtesans? Driven by hunger and cold, we sing mournful songs everywhere, tasting the bitterness of life. Dancers are forever adrift. Who willingly becomes a slave? Who wants to see their homeland fall? Pitiful are the songstresses under the iron heel, whipped and bruised all over.</p>

<p>Opening "Dream of the Red Chamber: Ziyuan Cries for Lin" The wind and rain are torrential, wanting to break the soul. The flower branches are desolate, lamenting their drifting and withering. Ziyuan, the little maid, is a sentimental girl. She serves day and night, accompanying Sister Pin. She is, thinking of her mistress, her heart is about to break. She can't help it. A burst of sadness fills her eyes with tears. Miss, thinking of you, your delicate body always carries a three-part pant. You are listless, and medicine is ineffective. Although, Second Master Bao has loved you since childhood. He is, the moon in the water, the person in the mirror. Only this servant, a diligent little maid, cares deeply. Lonely and neglected, who cares? As the saying goes, beautiful women have always been envied by heaven. A fleeting moment of glory turns into darkness. Now, who is under the gauze window? Only the jade beauty is buried in the yellow earth. Miss, alas, your fragrant soul scatters with the wind. Sadness enters dreams often at midnight. The scent of leftover medicine remains. The reflection in the mirror is cold, covered in dust. A thousand bamboo trees in front of the window. Several trunks stained with tear marks. Cold and desolate is the Xiaoxiang Pavilion. Quiet and lonely, the boudoir is deeply closed. Listen, the parrot doesn't care about people's haggardness. It mutters the sound of burying flowers. Miss, where does your spirit go to in the underworld? Can you tell me a few words before you die? Now, the person is gone, but the things remain. The autumn rain and autumn wind sadden people. This servant, I can't sleep soundly on long nights. Grief piles up until the fifth watch. Seeing things and thinking of people, my heart is about to break. In my dreams, I don't see you, my Lady of Spring. I am all alone, taking refuge in the Rongning Mansion. It's as if, the building is empty, and the nest is overturned. Look, fallen petals cover the ground, and no one sweeps them. Who will bury the flower soul in the Tomb of Buried Fragrance? Ziyuan cried to the point of heartbreak. She bites her silver teeth and sighs a few times. She is, her cries and tears are profuse. Miss, may your spirit walk slowly. I will accompany you on the road to the underworld, morning and evening.</p>

<p>Opening "Past Life in a Dream"</p>
<p>Last night, I was lying in my study, feeling listless. I had wild and fanciful dreams. I wandered around the garden in a daze. I happened to meet a beautiful woman. At this time, the scorching summer heat had just ended. And we just welcome the chilly early autumn. I strolled slowly past the corridor. I was surprised to see a beautiful lady. Seeing her, her face lightly made up. Her hair shiny and thick. She wore a thin, short silk jacket. She held a light needlework basket in her hand. Her eyes were full of affection, as beautiful as jade. Her posture was graceful, as beautiful as a phoenix. She saw me, a handsome young man with a charming appearance. She often cast amorous glances at me. She softly called me softly. A whiff of lipstick fragrance wafted in the air. I was originally just idly wanting to find someone to support me at home. She also, was troubled, without a satisfactory husband. The two of us, cherished each other, our hearts were in sync. We walked side by side across the horizontal pond. In the pond, clear blue water was filled with mandarin ducks. They nestled together intimately, happily. We, wished to emulate the joy of flying together, like mandarin ducks. How could we have known, that the time in the copper clepsydra was up. The beautiful dream ended abruptly. I woke up, the bright sun was shining. It was all just a dream.</p>

<p>The Grand View Garden scenery is very secluded. One might think it's a small isle of Penglai. The current thatched cottage is elegant. Clearly, the beautiful scenery is hidden in the Red Chamber. It hides unmatched flower-like women. People say they are flower-like, but flowers are still shy. Outside the Xiaoxiang Pavilion, the shadows of 琅玕 bamboo trees. Bitter rain and sour wind fill the autumn. Her father is biased and far away, her mother is partial to the garden. Leaning on the carved railing, she cannot stop her hatred. The gardens are wide. The scenery is secluded. Only the crowds of attendants come and go. She's lazy to comb her hair and wash her face. She fears the stars and moon at dusk are like a hook. Hooking up the ten thousand loads of sorrow in her heart. Sadly, her kind mother passed away first. The lonely girl is left at her maternal family's house. The old matriarch loves her like a precious treasure. The sisters' deep feelings throw themselves into her. Far apart from her father, thousands of miles away. Her dream soul often circles over Yangzhou. She hopes for an imperial edict. She will dance in colorful clothes to repay her filial piety. When will she comfort my lifelong wish? She burns incense and prays day and night. The saddest thing is a matter of concern. The two words "lifelong happiness" are not freely decided. Although a good match may be made in the future. Yet, the matchmaker has not been consulted. This feeling is embarrassing to tell outsiders. She sheds tears in the wind under the moon. Her own obsession, her own planning.</p>

<p>The night before, during the filming of "Little Sisters," Yuan Meiyun accidentally triggered a mechanism in the "Map of Treasures" set, causing her to fall into a tunnel eight feet deep. By the time she was rescued, her face was ashen. Fortunately, she only suffered abrasions to her legs and was not seriously injured.</p>
<p>More than half of "Map of Treasures" has been completed. The crew will depart for Wuxi and the surrounding areas in the coming days to shoot outdoor scenes, and are expected to return in five days.</p>
<p>Bao Tianming has been designing the set for "Guangling Temple" recently, without a break.</p>
<p>"Little Sisters" is expected to be completed in mid-next month, and a special issue is being actively edited and will be published before the premiere of "Little Sisters."</p>
<p>Art-China magazine is very popular with readers. The two special issues that have already been published, "Incarnation Girl" and "The Newlywed Massacre," have both sold out.</p>
<p>Recording engineer Gu Zongyi has recently made major improvements to the recording equipment, so the sounds in "Little Sisters" are clearer than in previous films and have reached a state of perfection.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin's new work, "Mysterious Flower" (tentative title), will soon be completed. It is said to be "a serious theme with a humorous performance," and the story is said to be novel.</p>
<p>Yao Shiquan's cinematography in "Little Sisters" made a huge contribution.</p>
<p>"Map of Treasures" is a thrilling and exciting detective film with humor and seriousness, entertainment and education, starring Wang Yin, Zhou Xuan, Wang Cilong, Guan Hongda, Jiang Xiu, Liang Dusheng, Zhao Manna, and others.</p>
<p>The dog actor, Peili, in "Map of Treasures" performs so "beautifully" that it is worthy of applause.</p>
<p>Xu Qinfang and You Guanren both have excellent performances in "Little Sisters."</p>
<p>The list of successful male actors who were recruited by Art-China will be announced soon.</p>

<p>Since "The Light of Motherhood," Jin Yan has had many works, but in these works, he has never been seen wearing a beautiful suit or a handsome bow tie. In the recent "Go to Nature," he simply doesn't wear any clothes.</p>
<p>Qin Tong's son, Qin Haiyou, has a round face and smiling eyes. One look at him and you know he's a mischievous child. In "The Lost Lamb," he plays a student teasing the old tutor (played by Hong Jingling), driving the old tutor crazy. That hilarious performance is even more interesting than Qin Guanbao's闹學 [making a scene at school] in "Baolian Lantern."</p>
<p>Bai Lu, who played a maidservant in "Metropolitan Landscape," is still playing a maidservant in "Go to Nature." However, the maidservant in "Go to Nature" is a little more flirtatious and passionate. In the play, Han Langen proposed to her.</p>
<p>"The Lost Lamb" is all-encompassing, with chickens, cats, dogs, cows, sheep, and even two tiny butterflies all giving good performances.</p>
<p>Ge Zuozhi, the protagonist of "The Lost Lamb," likes to paint cow snouts. Entering his bedroom is like visiting an exhibition of cow snout paintings.</p>
