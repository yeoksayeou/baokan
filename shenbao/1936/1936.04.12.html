<p>在今日局勢之下操縱國聯之大國如英法等其眞能出而仗義執言經濟制裁而外繼以武力制裁乎此等大國卽無羅卡諾條約宣吿廢除事件發生卽無德國國防軍開入萊茵不設防區域亦且不願爲其所輕視之有色人種盡此任務况當此歐洲多事之秋耶</p>
<p>英國保守黨政府之態度當意阿戰爭之始卽極曖昧保守黨去年末所以一變其以往態度而竭力對意制裁者實爲大選期屆英國國內民情一致反對侵略戰爭保守黨爲迎合輿情以求選舉獲勝不得不主張對意制裁故保守黨此舉非有愛於和平更非有愛於阿比西尼亞也大選勝利保守黨目的已達而保守黨之出賣國聯出賣阿國亦肇其端霍爾外相竟與法總理賴伐爾共同草定和平方案承認意國占有在侵略戰爭中所獲得之阿國士地並另劃一大部分阿國土地作爲意國移民及經濟開發之用和平天使之面目一變而爲猙獰宜其引起國人之不滿而不得不出於辭職一途保守黨雖經此挫折而其根本政策並無改變假如意國之態度不過甚其慾望亦不過奢東菲軍事行動亦能適可而止不侵入査那湖流域內英人勢力範圍可料英國保守黨人必將擇一適當時機出而慷他人之慨以求所謂和平也</p>
<p>英國之態度如斯法國又如何</p>
<p>吾人未討論法國政策以前吾人必先知法國左右兩派對意政策之區別當英人之主張制裁也法國右派報紙認爲此舉足以毁損斯脫萊柴陣綫驅使法國與意對立而使德國國社黨人有其餘裕挿足於奧匈及米美爾左派報紙持論則異是謂法國必與英合萊茵河岸之安全始能保障羅卡諾之精神始能保持兩派之意見雖大有出入然其防德之再起而維護法國在大陸之安全則一也賴伐爾內閣如斯薩勞內閣亦如斯故自前兼外長賴伐爾至現外長佛蘭亭其外交政策願與英保持其歐戰以來之恊調關系亦願與意保持斯脫萊柴陣綫及羅馬恊定後所發生之意法親密</p>
<p>迨至最近英法意之相互關系已有急驟變化德國軍隊開駐非武裝區法國對意之態度有一突變意國軍隊進佔阿境之貢達城前鋒將及査那湖流域而英國之態度有一突變蓋法國在歐洲大陸之敵乃德而非意而英國在地中海及菲洲之敵乃意而非德利害不同向背自異法國爲防制德國復仇極願維持羅卡諾傳統由英國担保其安全無如英國保守黨人始終無確切之表示則法自必有轉與同爲拉丁民族而足爲其有力奧援之又一大國拉攏之必要法國如何始能得意之歡心至目前遂爲法國政治家首應考慮之問題在此情勢之下法國不敢公然開罪意國自屬意中事而意國亦必藉此居奇亦理所必然意之挾奧以自重也聯德以壯聲勢也皆所以明示法人苟加緊制裁吾將去而之他爲法國敵矣法爲拉攏意國亦安得不與英人背道而馳提出中止制裁辦法以見好於意國耶法與意國沆病瀣氣則必召英人之不快英之所重視者乃藍尼羅河之水源今意軍進達査那湖境査那湖爲意國所控制則吳屬蘇丹種棉地帶之水利將有失其調劑之虞吾人曾見意國當局對於埃及利益表示尊重之消息而意人對於査那湖流域英人利益之尊重則尙未之聞意軍之進展意人之野心在在皆與英人利益衝突則英人之焦慮可知矣英外相艾登在十三國委員會指摘意人之慘酷與努力以</p>
<p>今後歐洲大局苟無特殊之發展則阿國之將被諸大國置諸國聯壇玷上宰割定可預卜所不可知者乃意國至如何限度卽能滿足共領慾而英國退讓至如何限度卽甘罷休耳</p>

<p>藝術漫談</p>
<p>赤欄橋外柳千條（下）</p>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>綠象徵和平。故車站上允許火車前進時用綠旗，馬路上允許車首前進時用綠燈。這些雖然是人爲的記號，其取用時也不無自然的根據。設想不用紅和綠而換兩種顏色，例如黃和紫，藍和橙，就遠不及紅和綠的自然，又不容易記憶，駕車人或將因誤認而肇事亦未可知。只有紅和綠兩色，自然而易於記憶。駕車人可從燈的色彩上直覺地感到前途的狀况，不必牢記這種記號所表示的意味。人的眼睛與身體的戚覺，巧妙地相關聯着。紅色映入眼中，身體的感覺自然會緊張起來。綠色映入眼中，身體的感覺自然會從容起來。你要見了紅免强裝出從容來，見了綠免强裝出緊張來，固無不可；然而不是人之常情。從和平更進一步，綠又象徵親愛。故替人傳達音信的郵差穿綠衣。世界語學者用象徵和平親愛的綠色爲標識。都是很有意義的規定。大槪人類對於綠色的象徵力的認識，始於自然物。像今天這般風和日麗的春天，草木欣欣向榮，山野遍地新綠，人意亦最歡慰。設想再過數月，綠樹濃陰，漫天匝地，山野中到處結人張着自然的綠茵與綠幕，人意亦最快適。故凡歡慰，和樂，平靜，親愛，自然，快適等性狀，都可由自然所有的色彩而聯想。總之，綠是安靜的象徵。</p>
<p>紅和綠並列使人戚到美觀，由上述的種種用例和象徵力便可推知。紅象徵生動，綠象徵安靜。旣生動而又安靜，原是最理想的人生。自古以來，太平盛世的人，心中都有這兩種感情飽和地融合着。目前的「赤欄橋外柳千條」的色彩，正是太平盛世的象徵。</p>
<p>這也可從色彩學七解說：世間一切色彩，不外由紅黃藍三色變化而生。故紅黃藍三者稱爲「三原色」。三原色各有其特性；紅熱烈，黃莊嚴，藍沉靜。每兩種原色相拼合，成爲「三間色」，卽紅黃爲橙，紅藍爲紫，黃藍爲綠。三間色亦各有其特性；橙是熱烈加莊嚴，卽神聖：紫是熱烈加沉靜，卽高貴；綠爲莊嚴加沉靜，卽和平也。如此屢决拼合，卽可產生無窮的色彩，各有無窮的特性。今紅與綠相配合，換言之，卽紅與黃藍相配合。對比中三原色俱足，換言之，卽包含着世間一切色彩。故映入人目，戚覺飽和而圓滿，無所偏缺。可知紅綠對比之所以使人感覺美滿，根本的原因在於三原色的俱足。然三原色俱足的對比，不止紅綠一種配合而已。黃與紫（紅藍），藍與橙（紅黃），都是俱足二原色的。何以紅與綠的配合特別美滿呢？這是由於三原則性狀不同之故。色彩中分陰陽二類，紅爲陽之主；色彩中分明暗二類，紅爲明之主；色彩中分寒暖二類，紅爲暖之主。陽强於陰，明强於暗，暖强於寒。故紅爲三原色中最强者，力强於黃，黃又力强於藍。故以黃藍合力（綠）來對比紅，最爲勢均力敵。紅藍（紫）對比黃决之。紅黃（橙）對比藍又决之。從牠們的象徵上看，也可明白這個道理：熱烈，莊嚴，與沉靜，在人的感情的需要上，也作順决的等差。熱烈第一，莊嚴决之，沉靜又决之。重沉靜者失之柔，重莊嚴者失之剛。只有重熱烈者，始得陰陽剛柔之正，而合於人的威情的需要，允適於生氣蓬勃的人的心情。故朴厚的原始人歡喜紅綠；天眞的兒童歡喜紅綠；喜慶的人歡喜紅綠；受了麗日和風的薰陶，忘懐了時世的憂患，而徬徨於西湖濱的我，也歡喜「赤欄橋外柳千條」的色彩的飽和，因此暫時體騐了盛世黎民的幸福的心情。</p>
<p>可惜這千條楊柳不久就要搖落變衰。只恐將來春歸夏衋，秋氣肅殺，和平的綠色衋歸烏有，單讓赤欄橋的含有保險性的色彩獨佔了自然界，而在灰色的環境中猖獗起來。然而到那時候，西湖上將不復有人來欣賞景色，我也不會再在這裏榜徨了。　十五年三月十八日</p>

<p>（本報特寫）近年來不景氣的潮流、震盪了整個的世界、允共是遠東的中國、從九一八·和一二八以後、商業的衰落、農村的破產、失業羣的增加、工商業牛產量的减少在在是反映着社會金融的枯竭、顯出了百業蕭條的底層、這眞是世界不景氛圍中、今日中國的眞相、</p>
<p>上海是遠東的第一個商埠、是中國的水陸交通的總　、且爲世界各國推銷商品的唯一大市場、計算東西各國、每月到吳淞、進浦口的輪船、最少有四五百艘、航仃江海綫的尙不在內、每年外貨的輸入、其數量亦可想見、但是近三年來、進口貨額、亦銳减得可驚、允其是去年與今歲、輸入的外貨、更一落萬丈、我國六十餘年來、未曾遇見過的海關出超、今年居然打破紀錄、這是好現象嗎不、道正是反映着我國購買力的沒有、洋貨輸入的减少、眞因還是在市面的不景氣、</p>
<p>中國出口貨物旣可超越進口貨、在理是好現象、但細檢　關報吿的字數、尙還不及往年入超月度時的數量、因整個的進口貨衰落、便直接影響到各大輪船公司、在最近的數年中、凡經營遠洋和外海的輪船公司、不論歐洲班·或美國班·百分的九十九、是虧本的、要是能够維持開支、已經算是鳳毛麟角了、所以在遠東的藍星公司船、首先停航、經營數十年根深蒂固的怡泰格林輪、亦歸併藍烟囱、</p>
<p>因整個航運的衰落便引起在遠東歐洲航商極大震恐、起先尙各用競爭的方式、以暗放回佣、爲多載貨件的條件、但是這種舉動、總是不規則的搗亂行爲、而且中國的輸出貨、一天一天的减少、由是上海的英·法·日·美·意·德·荷·及那威·丹麥」力國的航商、集議了多時、始商定了一個救濟遠東「歐洲航運的安善辦法、廢除放佣貶價的各個競裝、實施大同盟的運貨「公派」、由全體航商、公聘一公證人主辦這事、</p>
<p>上海運往歐洲出口貨、現在已較前减少到三分之二、（主因是東北大荳雜糧沒有裝了）全年的輸出、照目前的調査、至多在十一萬至十六萬噸、而輪船公司之競裝的、英國有五家、法國有一家、德國有兩家、美國一家、日本一家、那威·丹麥·荷蘭·意大利·亦各一家、公攤的主張、就自從不息寡而患不均轉到「均無貧和無寡」的原則上、</p>
<p>公攤POOL在外國各鐵道、早有成例、凡屬平行綫的、均有公攤制、我國長江六公司、亦有公攤制、但辦法與這會歐洲航運公攤、似乎相同而有不同的地方、歐洲公攤、是經主辦道事的「湯笙洋行」、先將每月從上海（即是全中國）的出口貨總數、調査明白、再把十四家輪船公司的船隻和噸位、加以統計、然後用百分率的比例、來支配裝貨的數額、一經攤定、便不准再行競攪、就是客家裝貨、亦得先向湯笙接洽、領取一張公攤邋貨證、方可以去報運、</p>
<p>十四家輪公司的公攤比率、經記者群細的調査，茲分列在下、　大英輪公司占十四分、　藍烟囱公司占十三分又四、　日本郵船會社占十二分又二五、自美最時洋行占十分、　亨寳輪公司占九分又五、　法國郵船公司占五分又一○、　意郵公司占四分二五、　荷蘭渣華公司（歐洲班）占五分、　順亨洋行占五分、　實隆洋行占三分又五○、　　怡泰（現婦怡和）占四分、　　怡和洋行（歐洲班）占二分、　　滙昌洋行占三分、　　大來洋行占一分、</p>
<p>公攤現已實行貨雖少、亦均派、每噸的運費、從此可以維持到至少收七十五個先令的制度、回佣限給一成、但須一七兩月、方可結算、這種辦法、在裝貨上的便利與否、是另一問題、可是在這航運不景氣中、歐洲航輪界、總算得到了一個深切而穩固的解决辦法了、從此以後、無畸輕畸重了、</p>

<p>— 江問漁</p>
<p>（九）</p>
<p>我們再來看一看一般職工罷、我們絕不能說大多數職工中沒有天才出衆的人、因為人數太多了、當然就要有特殊人物、這些特殊天才、旣然無力升學、已經是萬分委屈了、若再沒有補習敎育機會給他、那不是更對不起人麽、我很相信倘有各級職業補習學校、以供給他們訓練、其中有一部份特殊天才、一定可以表現出來、路出頭角、蔚成大器、可憐一班舊式農工商界、因無補習敎育、已不知埋沒了許多天才、這一層、眞是十分要緊啊、這是從特殊天才方面看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>（十）</p>
<p>還有一層、我要附帶說的、天地間辦理一切事業、皆要以經濟爲貴、你能用費少、效力大、那就是成功的價値比較高、普通辦敎育的、要造校舍、購儀器、買標本、種種設備、花費許多、結果物力耗了不少、而實際成效、未必能眞如所期、並且就設備來說、也未必眞能充分利用、這是多麼可惜、若職業補習學校、可以借用已有的校舍、已有的儀器標本、不必另有設備、而敎育的目換已達、若是在農塲工廠內設置補習學校則便利更多、那末、旣有正式學校以及其他農場工廠可以利用、又何樂而不為呢、並且這樣辦法、　方皆有利益、學校農塲工廠有了補校、旣可得着許多帮助、而補校不必另行設備、便可以多多設立、這還不是十分經濟麼、並且我更希望以後凡是公共塲所、皆可設職業補習學校、這是就辦理便利上和經濟效能上看出職業補習敎育的重要性、</p>
<p>職業補習敎育、旣有了這樣十種重要性、我們還不應該大大提倡、大大鼓吹、大大推廣一下麽、（完）</p>

<p>— 史紀法</p>
<p>（五）對於安徽茶葉改良之意見</p>
<p>在死亡綫上掙扎着的安徽茶葉，第一是生產大减茶　荒蕪，茶商倒閉（蝕本）茶市凋敝，例如婺源及屯溪兩地原有製茶棧號三百餘家，年來受金融壓迫的影響停歇　百餘家，對外銷路日蹙，農民因茶葉無處銷售，亦紛紛廢棄茶田，別謀生產，各產茶區域因多山之故，如徽州各縣及皖北六安英山霍山等縣數年來均遭匪共蹂躪以至茶園荒蕪。再則多山各縣交通梗塞，外運不便，茶市更見蕭條。整頓及改良安徽茶葉方法如次：</p>
<p>（一）調查　調查國內各省縣產茶之區域，毬類，値價，年出額之比較多寡，則茶業之盛衰情形可知一般。對於窳劣製造裝璜等項，得隨時調查改良倣效。至於國外產茶國如印度錫蘭爪哇日本等亦須調查其茶種試騐優劣，擇其優良者設法購値，廣傳國內產茶省縣，一律改良種植。共他與茶葉關係重大之土壤地質氣候等亦須加以詳細調查研究。國內外各商埠須設華茶分銷處，俾　零星躉發，以期銷路擴充，並設專門調查人員，專箏調查各銷路情况，隨時報吿政府（省縣）轉達各實業機關以便運輸，而廣銷路。</p>
<p>（二）指導　皖省產茶素負盛名，惟缺乏指導。茶葉日衰，今後多設茶務之講習所，招收實習者若干名，從事研究　門技術，卒業後分發各產茶區域，指導農民，或共同組織公司，合作社，以期茶改良與普及，發展茶業前途</p>
<p>（三）宣傳　每屆茶季，　茶業機關（公司合作社農材試騐場農科　門學生，民衆敎育館農民敎育館等）應派講演員若干人至產茶各地，宣傳改良茶葉種植，種子，施肥，製作諸方法，並須聯絡各茶號及茶商討論具體辦辦，組織製茶公司，購買機器，從事根本改良。合資出版刋物小冊及種種宣傳傳單標語廣告向外宣傳，久之而能普及，利益實非淺鮮。此外茶葉之裝璜精緻，商標美麗，亦可用文字圖畫宣傳之憂點而廣銷路。</p>
<p>（四）試騐　茶事之研究與試騐其重要者不外種子，肥料，土壤，化學，氣候，雨量，蟲害，……等。惟値此財政困窮，又加以科學不甚發達之故，試騐當不能完備，應擇其不可緩奢提先試騐研究如苗圃，繁殖，移植，剪枝，條播，輪播，壓穗及其他改良製法（科學的）均依照步驟，先决仿效時印度，有良好成結之試騐。</p>
<p>（五）改良　（甲）我國茶農素不注意栽培法，即注重亦完用採用舊法。皖北六安霍山舒城等縣之種茶，每年耕耘一次，施肥一次，間有不耕耘不施肥，簡直與野生無異不用人工栽培者。皖南之祁門婺源秋浦等縣亦多興皖北相同。且山高之區，不易整理栽培，但一經雨水，則土中養分流出，遂致茶樹早衰，生葉减少，所以茶園及茶業機關管理必須注意。於坡形地區，宜多用條播法適合茶樹生育，且可保留土中養分，易於暢達旣便工作，又便管理，平原悉劃為苗圃區，以備移置，及他場徵集之用。（乙）我國茶戶中施肥　者僅百分之二三，其所用之肥料大概不外人糞尿，豆粕，油粕，木灰，堆肥，草肥，稻稈等。查祁門一縣，無處不種油菜，其目的用製食油所餘之渣滓，俗名枯，油枯當有蛋素，且價値低廉，用作施肥於茶樹頗爲適宣。此種施肥法應多推廣之。（　）製法紅綠茶之製造，以前純用足揉法，今須改良革新，紅茶借日光萎凋與發酵，不甚良好，因熱度過强大，用沸永泡冲時，不免生日光臭味，目乏香氣，須改用屋內萎凋法。綠茶製造，所用機器最佳，惟經濟困難，一時不便購置，可擬做效　本手揉作法，用蒸氣蒸菁，蒸畢，置冷却台，使水分稍减後，將揉床內置炭火烘焙，乾後，形狀色澤香味，極其優美。（丁）裝璜皖北以篾簍內蒲葉貼之以裝茶葉，粗劣不堪，久之於色澤香味均大有衰减，皖南之茶號雖用木箱裝盛，亦不能引起外人之美感，且箱板極薄，海關車輪上下搬運，每多破裂，外人採購極爲麻煩。改良裝璜擬製彩色鐵瓶罐之類分半斤一斤五斤十斤或磅之罐頭多種，形如今日之罐頭食品餅乾等，以投外人之歡迎，及旅行車船携帶之便利，至海外出品，採用五十磅或百磅富麗堅固之木箱以便遠途運銷。</p>
<p>（六）銷路之推廣　（甲）隨時刊佈關係茶業之調查統計，外人之嗜好，貿易之情况，金融之狀况，改良之方策，及專家研究所得討論介紹及枇評，俾國內茶商及茶農有所借鏡，此外發行專書小冊均可推廣其銷路。（乙）聯絡京滬漢閩平津魯各地茶商及茶棧組織茶業交易所合作社公司之類，作整個推銷計劃。（丙）皖業茶者，少習外國語言文字，且乏國際貿易智識，故於外人直接交易不易，不得不仰茶棧之鼻息，聽通事之指揮，外受洋商之壟斷，內受茶棧之欺弄，種種痛苦不可言狀。且對於發展茶業不易，今後如能於外國各埠，廣設分銷處，零售　發，直接運銷，則挽回茶商之損失，數當甚大。</p>
<p>（七）整頓之步驟　（甲）多設植製分場，或研究機關，聘請專門人才指導一切。（乙）組織茶業有限公司共同營業，發展茶業，擴充海外國內商埠市場。（內）籌設茶業銀行或其他金融機關流通金融，活動市場。（丁）設茶業檢查所，取締製造不良之出品，並防奸商個昌雜加劣貨以致失却外人信用，頒佈取締法規，嚴格檢查，不使奸商舞弊或操縱市場。（戊）設學校培植茶業專門人材，用研究實習之方法，發展茶業前途。（己）集資採購機器，科學化改良茶葉生產，製造等。（庚）設置茶園的管理，除害，灌溉，施肥等，以增產量，改良茶品質。（辛）開發交通，以利茶葉的運輸。（完）</p>

<p>小朋友們！奮起吧！莫再那麼撒嬌地躺在你媽的懷裏過着那甜蜜（？）的生活吧！要知道糖菓雖然很甜，可是結果口裏總有點酸溜溜不大好受的。讓你們起來，打破這個錯誤的觀念吧！</p>

<p>這個小朋友名字呌瑪丁，他住在美國塔干蔭斯洲奧斯汀地方，今年才十歲，已於前年夏季升入奧斯汀高級中學裏讀書，預料明年就可升入塔千薩斯大學了。</p>
<p>他的天資，特別聰敏，不到兩歲就能讀英文短句，三歲能記淸美國各州間邊境地名，四歲他自己能够學習天文地理，成續很好，五歲才入奧斯汀某私立中學讀書，兩年跳進初中，又兩年就再跳進高中了。</p>
<p>他的讀書速率，每分鐘平均能讀一千六百字，在他讀書最快的時候，一分鐘內竟能讀二千一百字，這是他學校裏田「科學眼」的測騐方法測騐出來的。</p>
<p>從這個科學眼裏，又發現瑪丁所以讀書能有這樣快的原由，是因他看書看在第一行的時侯，他的眼睛，已斜向左方，倒看到二行三行……接着連續的並看下去了，正合成語「一目十行「的話，是常人所做不到的。</p>
<p>大凡聰敏絕頂，多不肯用功，但瑪丁是將讀書作他的唯一嗜好。又凡看書過快，每難領會，但瑪丁讀過之後，記憶力也不弱，說給人家聽，也能够說得很詳細並很週到的。還有人旣是聰敏，又肯用功，却不喜歡運動，身體每多虛弱，但瑪丁非常愛好運動，騎馬和游泳，他是最喜歡的，所以他的身體，非常健壯，體重有九十磅，高有四呎八吋，外表好似十三歲的模樣了。</p>
<p>瑪丁特別聰敏，常人雖是勉强不來的，他那樣努力學業，鍜鍊身體，一般小朋友，是人人能做到的啊！</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>『敏兒你的身體不十分强健，將來怎能爲國效勞呢？所以你一方面要時時注意運動，運動是唯一的健身良方，不過不要太劇烈，只要每天有一刻多鐘的運動，就够了。一方面吃些補品，這就是所謂外修內補，身體當然會强健的。』敏兒的爸爸時時這樣叮囑着。所以在一天的下午，他老人家買了一瓶魚肝油回來。敏兒覺得這魚肝油又腥氣又難吃，所以他不願意吃，不過爲了要强健自己的身體，只得勉强的吃下去了。他不懂他爸爸爲什麼給他吃這樣不適口的東西？</p>
<p>『爸爸，你爲什麼不給我好吃的東西，偏要給我這不適口的魚肝油吃呢？到底這魚肝油有什麼好處？』</p>
<p>『我們生活上有一種物質是必不可缺少的，就是維太命又呌生活素。這種物質起初發現在米和牛乳中，不過數量很少，而魚肝油中比較是多些，如果我們缺少了這維太命，就是不能畏成身體也不康健了。』</p>
<p>『這魚肝油是什麼東西做成的？』</p>
<p>『魚肝油是在太平洋和大西洋中的一種海魚，這海魚呌鰵魚，產在太平洋和大西洋的北部。這鰵魚有大有小，大的平均有二十磅和三十磅左右，大約合我國十五斤到二十多斤左右，小的也有十二磅，你看這魚肝油瓶上的畫圖就知魚的大小形態了。它在海底下一百五十英尺到五百英尺之間，所以捕捉鰵魚也不是容易的事。鰵魚富有脂肪質，魚肝油就是從它身上提取出來製成的。它的肉也可以吃，新鮮的，醃的，曬乾的，不過我國市塲上沒有這種魚出賣。</p>
<p>『經營這漁業的，有英，法，美，日，紐芬蘭等國，紐芬蘭（在北美洲）沿海一帶，魚的出產更多，所以在西曆一七一三年，英國就把紐芬蘭成爲殖民地了。』</p>

<p>井中的寳物</p>
<p>一個商人帶着許多珍珠寳貝，走夜路，一個不小心，跌到一個枯井裏去了。這井有十多丈深。耍爬出來，比上天還難。於是他急得滿頭大汗，喊道，『救命！救命！』</p>
<p>附近有四五個人聽到他的喊聲，跑過來了。但是其中有一個最强橫的人，援出刀來，指着其餘三四入說道：『我來救，你們不准救！他是我的堂兄弟，只有我可以救他，滾開！』</p>
<p>別的人看到他那麼兇狠，便站在一旁，暫時旁觀着。他於是靠着井邊俯下去對井中人說道：『你瞧，剛才那些人都是搶你東西的强盜呢。那裏是眞心來救你的。現在，我來救你。』他一面說，一面取了一根繩子，從上面宕下去。井中人以爲眞的是救星來了，急忙搶住了繩子，往自己的腰裏圍了一轉，希望上面的人馬上拉他上去。</p>
<p>不料那人叱道：『且慢，先把你的珍珠寳貝吊上來，我替你收藏着。這兒强盜多，你是沒有力量對付他們的！』井中人也不仔細忖忖，糊糊塗塗聽了他的話，把珍珠寳貝繫在繩子上，吊了上去。那個人得到了珍珠寳貝，取了一塊大石頭，只聽見『碎』的一聲，如泰山壓頂，可憐愚蠢的商人，全個身體給壓扁了。</p>
<p>那個人心花亂放地拿了搶得的東西回家，不料剛才那幾個旁觀的人，突然出來攔住他，喝道：『喂，朋友，識相點！有好處大家分分，不要獨吞！』於是，這一批人都顯出兇惡面孔，打起來了，誰也想把那商人的東西搶到手。</p>
<p>搶去了的孩子</p>
<p>張家有一個孩子，很聰明，很俊秀，却給！的鄰居李家看中了。有一夜，居然被李家派了幾個僕人，闖入了這孩子的臥室，一抱就抱了去。而目硬作主張何公超，呌他改了姐，認自己作爸爸，張家勢力不及李家，又不肯振作，一味的忍氣吞聲耐着。那孩子住在李家，受着壓迫，痛苦不堪。父子倆雖然分居兩地，可是他們在心裏，總是日夜想念着。兒子的心裏這樣想：『爸爸，我現在雖則給人搶去了，遲早，我總要重新回到你的懷裏的。』爸爸的心裏這樣想：『可憐的孩子，我眞對不起你，因爲我不中用，使你這樣吃苦。不過，我是永遠不忘記你的，我總有一天要收回你』</p>
<p>可是，世界上的事情，眞是有氣得死人的：這一對不幸的父子的願望還沒有實現，那强橫的李家却早已有進一步的行動了。有一天，他提了一把刀，又跑到張家，惡狠狠地對張家的說：『這孩子是我的了，從今以後，他姓李，我是他一切的事情，不准你過問，如果你不他的爸爸，我要你承認這件事。以後，承認我的話，請你先吃我這一刀！』</p>

<p>— 子系</p>
<p>大家知道人們不可吸汚濁的空氣，須要常吸新鮮的空氣。其實空氣的所謂汚濁，不過空氣中多着炭酸氣一類的東西罷了：所謂新鮮也不過是空氣中少炭酸氣一類的東西罷了。汚濁空氣吸了有害，新鮮空氣吸了有益，　原是大家早已知道的。很多人以爲樹林裏，早晨的空氣是非常新鮮，吸了很是有益身體。可是這種見解，倒未見完全正確。因爲植物在日裏行一種光化作用，吸收炭氣，吐出養氣；在夜間却行一種呼吸作用，吸取養氣，吐出炭氣。所以早晨的樹林裹，光化作用尙未盛行，昨夜行呼吸作用時所放出的炭酸氣，還存留在樹林之中，這樣早晨樹林裏的空氣，好算新鮮的嗎？但是，只要一過盛行的光化作用以後，那就確很新鮮而乾净啦。所以小朋友別太早到樹林裏去呼吸，這是很重要的。</p>

<p>那古老的紅磨坊，他本來當作是當地的唯一目標的，每天來來往往，總得在磨坊前停一停脚，往往有一個卷髮如雲的小女郎的頭探出來歡迎他，伊那紅噴噴的小手中，往往拿着一根肉骨或一個硬麵包給柏德希吃。</p>
<p>如今他們每回經過時，柏德希總得失望似的向那關閉着的門瞧一下，而小甫洛也不再在門前停脚了，心中懷着滿腔的苦痛，急急地走了過去。可憐那屋子裏的小愛洛坐在壁爐旁的小凳上，淚珠兒撲簌簌地掉落下來，沾濕了伊手中的編織物；而伊的父親柯甘士在磨輪和粉袋旁邊工作着，仍然不變他的堅强的决心，暗暗地對自己說道：「還是這樣的好！那孩子老是想幹那沒出息的事情，化子是做定的了。我要是放他們厮守在一起，將來不知要惹起甚麼煩惱來哩。」</p>
<p>小南洛雖受了這樣的冷待，却並不抱怨：因爲他生性是很靜默的；他的祖父老達士曾屢次對他說：「我們是窮苦的人，一切都麼當順從上帝的意旨，無論給我們好的和壞的，我們都該接受，因爲窮人是不能挑選的。」</p>
<p>小南洛靜靜地聽着這些話，因爲他是很尊敬他的老祖父的：然而他是一個有天才的孩子，因此就有一種甜蜜而沒有把握的希望，在他的心中低低的說：「但是窮人有時也可以挑選的—挑選着做一個偉大的人物，旁的人也不能說他的不是吧。」</p>
<p>他老是這樣在靜默中想念着；有一天小愛洛偶然在運河邊的稻田中撞見了他，跑到他身旁和他擁抱，悲哀的嗚咽起來，因爲明天是伊的命名日，伊的父母預備舉行祝宴，可是並不請小南洛去參加，因此使伊傷心落淚。小南洛和伊接了一吻，很有自信力的悄悄地向伊說道：「愛洛，總有一天事情會變化過來的。到了那天你父親所帶回去的那塊松板，會和銀塊的一樣有價値：他可就不會將我關在門外了。你只要常常的愛我，親愛的愛洛：你只要常常的愛我，我一定會做成一個偉大的人物。」</p>
<p>小愛洛在淚眼糢糊中問道：「要是我不愛你呢？」</p>
<p>小南洛的眼睛離開了伊的臉，遠遠地望將出去，直望到那金紅色的斜陽所照射着的大禮拜寺塔尖。他的臉上現出一副甜蜜而又憂鬱的笑容來，小愛洛見了，暗暗吃驚。他在呼吸中迸出一句很堅決的話來道：「我終於要做成一個偉大人物的，愛洛，我要是做不成，那只有死」</p>
<p>小愛洛推開了他，努起了嘴說道：「那麽你是不愛我了」。小南洛搖着頭，微微地笑，穿過了黃色的稻草，很得意的走去，面前似乎起了一個幻像，好一片錦繡似的前程，好像自己已興高彩烈的回到故鄉，向小愛洛的父母提出求婚的話。</p>

<p>— 葉恭綽</p>
<p>以民生最大四種問題之一之住的問題，近年在我國之地位與其關係，日趨重要。尤其近日生產不振，百業銷沉，而住的需要，仍未十分减少。且因新建設的進展，各大都市之建築日益增多，每年全國所費，至少達數千萬元，而原料之外來者，殆達百分七十以上。故已與米麥紗布之湧進，同形爲極度之嚴重，應如何速謀補救，國民固皆有責。然終不如專門家及事業家之能明瞭而親切。又我國建築有數千年之歷史，其能代表遠東，固不待言。而處此學術日新時代，且環境時時演變，應如何方能發揮固有之優點，吸取外來之精神，以產生劃時代之作派‘此二者固皆急待解答者也。</p>
<p>然近年以來，各專門家事業家皆埋頭於所担負經營之業務，無復有餘裕爲較根本之研究。故上述之現狀，日日逐漸演進，卒無人爲之提撕警覺以謀挽救者，此其危險，殆亦不下於衣食二事。抑衣食二事，比較簡單，不如住之繁複而耗費。故住之一事，在今日我國，可謂特殊重要，而且嚴重。同人有鑒於此，因有建築展覽會之發起，意在集合全國之專門學者及建築同業共謀改進之策，期於學理上事實上觀摩攻錯，獲取新智識新方法，以適合時宜。同時於我國固有之優點，令大衆有充分之認識，而逐漸咀嚼融化，以應用之於現代之事物上，以成爲一國之作風，樹立東方之新規範。故徵求出品，分模型，圖樣，材料，工具，書報五大類，務使適合本會之需要，以供觀衆之研求。並邀請各專家分日講演建築上之各重要問題，以期交換智識。鄙人敢信此决展覽，必能給予觀衆以較深之印象，成爲一新的動力，以推進有關建築之諸般技能與事業，固非僅侈美觀通聲氣已也。</p>
<p>以人生刻不可離之事物如建築者，國中各界似未曾爲深切之注意，此不能不謂之可怪。但及今圖之，猶未爲甚晚。抑國內年耗數千萬金，從事建築，統計需要建築師監工，當逾數千，而國內養成此類人才，年不能逾百。全國大學有建築科者不過三數處，設備更多未完，未知是否各敎育當局以此爲已足。因一時漏未憶及。但此種現象之需要改良，固無疑義。此則深望各當局予以特別注意者也。</p>
<p>至於建築有關之事業如鍊鋼製鐵，製銅，造林，製木材，製油漆，顏料，玻瑯，陶磁，水泥，磚瓦，石，以及諸般裝飾，直接間接均與國民生計有關，亦卽利權消長所繫。默察一般心理，未嘗不知漏巵之可懼，但國內產物實未足供其需要。有時國產雖有可用，而經營不善，拙於運銷，遂致無從取給。而工師與建築業畏難取便，轉成習慣，因愈以杜塞國產發展之途。因果相乘，江河日下；不能不希望有關係者之速爲覺悟，及當局之竭力提倡者矣。</p>
<p>抑吾國建築之學，本非落後；專門馳譽，代有聞人。乃海通以還，旣不能墨守舊規，遂不免拾人餘唾。二十年來國內之大建築用費，不爲不巨，酬資不爲不豐，而能獨出心裁，表現其特有之意匠者，殆寥寥無幾，此亦我學術界事業界之恥也。試觀各國建築學與業如此發達，而研求我國建築之書籍，尙層出不窮，易地相衡，能無自媿。目下世界建築圖案，頗趨重東方式，爲整個建築學前途計，爲發揚我國固有特長計，均應有采擷菁華，提供世界之計劃，抑其責任係無可移易的。又我國今後建築，如何方始能產生一種新作風，爲世界上之中國的，現時代之中國的，同時並能顧及固有習慣及經濟現狀兩方面，不致與國民現實生活相背馳，且含有維持及發展國民生計之意義。此皆我建築界所應苦心焦慮，以謀解答者：蓋此種責任，舍我建築界以外，固無人能以擔負。故我建築界同人今日之責任，决非係能以取得自身之名利，卽可認爲滿足，卽可認爲對得住此時代與國家社會。深盼同人於此次集合之機會，十分注重於此點焉。茲因開幕伊始，敢直貢所懷如上，願大衆有以敎之。</p>

<p>一建築物不問共種類性質若何，均具有三大目的，卽經濟，適用，美觀是。歐美各國，因物質發達，文化進步，所以大戰前的建築，很少顧及上述三項原則，但戰後受着一種非常的敎訓，建築作風，幡然改轍。如昔日蠢大的台口綫，呆板的窗框或門框，週圍之外門頭綫等，全都摒棄不用，易以簡單整潔的平面及度頭角等，力求經濟美觀，適用耐久；不若已往之累贅而不切實用，靡費而惹入厭惡了。</p>

<p>日本在數年前，各種建築工程刋物及報章等，曾經有過一度劇烈的筆戰。前進的一派主張日本建築現代化，而守舊的則主保守。最後的結論，則主張保守日本建築式的一派，漸被淘汰。去年因傾向法西斯蒂運動，又一度創議日本式的建築，希圖死灰復燃。但不旋踵間　　　倫又被撲滅，　　築物　人類文化進程中之表徽；式樣的演化，都有着社會經濟等各種複雜的原因，共潛勢力非常偉大，决不能保守着門羅主義，停滯不進。所以日本建築界之主張保守日本建築的一派，卒因不適合時代的需要，屢起屢仆，不能存在。他的失敗是勢所必然的。</p>
<p>吾國自鼎革以還，各種建設都積極進行。自革命吿成，奠都南京後，一切行政設施，漸上軌道，政府當局，更努力建設，備具規模。試觀南京的各院部會官署，均先後修建，此外待建的公署爲數尤多，大可乘此時機，創造一種新的建築作風，適合上述經濟，適用與美觀的三原則。因爲現在一般建築作風，深感富於模倣性，失去了獨特的創造能力。我們雖不能數典忘祖，但把封建時代的產物如式搬演，亦失去了新時代的精神。新中國的精神亟應用劃時代的建築來表顯，若依舊以宮殿式樣爲建築之準則，姑不問其是吾經濟美觀，耐久適用，但故步自封不謀進取之嫌，是難以推辭的。猶憶報載覃振先生旅德考察司法時，遇法學名敎授某君，詢問覃先生，謂中國自革命完成後，法律之頒訂是吾依據三民主義之精神，覃先生突聞之餘，一時無以作答。設現有外籍建築學敎授，以中國建築現時之作風與趨向相詢，中國之名建築師一時對此恐亦難有切實之答辭，或卽直說中國現代之建築，係具兩重模倣性，一為模倣西洋作派，一卽中國的古代建築。至若新中國的新建築作風，現在尙未胚胎，何時孕育，更難臆測。</p>
<p>但一時代藝術精構的產生，全恃在該一時代藝人的努力與社會的督促。如果當今建築界的明哲，能下全力於中國建築新作風的研究，苟有所獲，述之為文，公開討論，彙集羣見，所得結論，對於中國的新建築作風，必能多所啟示及貢獻，或藉此力量，產生某種作風，使中國建築界現着新的曙光。</p>
<p>富於模倣性的建築，每易感覺到它祇具着蠢然的外表，沒有心靈的寄託。這也許因爲過趨模倣，專重抄襲，望之興味索然，令人有　腸盪氣之感，眼前祇覺實現一堆實體物，缺少富於創造的新精神。一般人對此容或不解眞相，祗覺富麗矞皇，美輪美奐；但當事者應知中國處境瀕危，物力維艱；最後生存，惟有求諸刻苦耐勞，磨勵以須。若把這種富於封建思想，靡費人力財力的建築，一再搬演，在此國難嚴重之時，建築人未免太不知趣了！</p>

<p>然此歷史悠久，幅員廣大之建築系統，乃爲數千年來其產生地之士大夫學者所不屑道；遺物雖多，而文獻無考者衆；整理每苦不得其門徑。故對其歷史及技術，欲加以澈底之研究，勢必徵之文獻，符之實物然後可。故本社暫設文獻法式二組，分工合作。爲工作便利計，先自研究淸式宮殿建築始。俟淸式旣有相當暸解，然後追溯明元，進求宋唐，以期迎刃而决。爲求達到上項目的，工作多以實物調查爲主。其餘整理舊籍，與編製圖書，均傾重實用方面。並以研究所得，爲國內各團體計劃古建築之修葺，及供給敎學用或設計用參考資料</p>

<p>。數載以來，社中工作，漸為社會一般所認識，而本社亦漸獲貢獻服務之機會，此同人等引為欣幸者也。</p>
<p>二　沿革及工作槪况</p>
<p>民國七年，朱桂辛先生道經南京，於江蘇省立圖書館，瀏覽圖籍，發現宋李明仲營造法式鈔本，乃商取當局同意，以石印本刋行。嗣與陶蘭泉先生，集四庫文淵文津諸本。悉心校　，於民國十四年，重刋仿宋本營造法式，海內學子，始漸知我國古代亦有營造之學。其後朱先生又致力於淸工程做法則例之整理。至民國十八年，先生以研究範圍日廣，深感個人獨立工作之不易，遂商請中華敎育文化基金董事會，每歲補助研究費一萬五千元，以三年為期；於是組織營造學社，由私人研究，進而成學術團體。其後又賡續補助，至今（民國二十五年）已七載於茲。</p>
<p>民國十九年三月，中國營造學社在北平寶珠子胡同七號正式成立。當時研究範圍，側重古籍整理，及外籍之譯述。除淸工部工程做法則例之整理，由民國十六年開始，尙須續繼工作外，並整理園治，及搜集哲匠錄與營造大事年表之資料。又本年度內，刋印彙刋第一卷一二兩期，其中要目有中國營造學社綠起並開會演詞，李明仲八百二十週忌之紀念，仿宋重刋營造法式校記，元大都宮苑圖考，及譯述數種。其時工作人員未逾十人。</p>
<p>民國二十年三月，舉行圓明園文物展覽於北平中山公園，引起社會之注意。第二年度中，除繼續蒐集文獻資料外，彙刋第二卷增為三期，其中要目有仿建熱河普陀宗乘寺誦經亭記，營造算例，及校印工段營造錄等文。</p>
<p>二十年七月，學社改組為文獻法式兩組。文獻組工作，側重史料之蒐集，主任由朱先生自兼。法式組重實物測量，及法式則例之整理，聘梁思成先生為主任。工作人員，增至十餘人。重要工作，計有編著哲匠錄，與明北京宮苑史料之蒐集，及測量河北薊縣獨樂寺遼建觀音閣，山門，賓坻縣遼廣濟寺三大士殿等。自是而後，每歲春秋二季，社員分組出發調查，成為本社主要之工作。而彙刋自本年度起，定為季刋，每年出版四期，稿件限於社員研究論文。</p>
<p>二十一年七月，因賓珠子胡同社址不敷應用，商得中山公園董事會同意。遷至天安門內西朝房，為本社社址。聘劉敦楨先生為文獻組主任。工作人員，增至二十餘人。本年度主要工作，有調查正定古建築，及編著營造法式新釋，搜集明實錄營造史料，并參加北平故宮文淵閣等處修葺計劃，及供給國內外團體學校參考用標本模型多處。</p>
<p>二十二年九月，調查山西大同應縣及河北正定趙縣元氏等處古建築，並收集淸代營造史料，梁思成先生所著淸式營造則例，亦於本年度出版。</p>
<p>二十三年夏，管理中英庚欵董事會議决補助本社圖籍編製費二萬元，分兩年撥付。是年秋，調查山西太原文水汾陽孝義介休靈石霍縣趙城及浙江杭州金華宣平，河北定興淶水，易涿等縣遺物，並應浙江建設廳之邀，計劃杭州六和塔修理計劃。翌年春，故都文物整理委員會聘本社為技術顧問，修葺北平古建築。又受內政敎育二部之聘，籌劃曲阜孔廟重修計劃。五月，調查河北安平曲陽定縣，及河南安陽等處古物，整理淸宮式橋座做法。</p>
<p>二十四年秋，測量故宮文淵閣文華殿內閣大庫，與蘇州古建築，北平喇嘛塔遺蹟。編輯中國建築設計參考圖集，古建築調查報告，文淵閣藏書全景，及明代營造大事年表等。</p>
<h3 id="c170">上海市建築恊會略史 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 漸</p>
<p>上海市建築恊會，成立迄今已有七年的歷史。建築界同志最初在浙江路迎春坊，原有一個集會，後因意見紛歧，解體為二，最後復合而為一，並賃平望街的榮陽里為會所。不數年間，因人事的變遷，環境的轉移，盛極一時的會務，歸到淸淡不振的境地。雖有幾個熱心者按日到會，但不幸恰於此時，又有某會員在弄口遭匪綁架，於是其餘幾個會員，咸惴惴自危，不敢蒞臨，把會所視為畏途，於是祇得將這集會暫告結束。</p>
<p>我們因為執業的關係，常能有機會聚在一處。自從會務停頓，疎散略久，於是更感到團體的組織，對於交誼的促進，業務的切磋，與精神的修飬等，都具有極大的潛勢力。我們更感覺到先前無目的無組織的集會，雖有團結的功能，但無中心的目標。於是經過多時的醖釀，與多次的討論，直到民國十九年春季，纔有上海市建築恊會的發起。公推作者起草會章，並設籌備處於九江路十九號三樓。除榮陽里時代舊有會員外，並徵得新進者多人，共同列名發起。此時各發起人對於會務的進展，分為兩派意見。一為急進的，一次徵求會員一千人，每人繳納會費二百元，總計可得二十萬元，如此可以購地建築會所，日後的經常費用，便可取給於會所餘屋租費的收入，庶幾會務前途，得立於安定久遠之基。主張此議者，為陳壽芝君，附和者為竺泉通，盧松華，王法鎬諸君是。與這派對峙的，以為本會尙在籌備時期，會務工作尙少，明瞭本會發起宗旨者亦復不多，先宜廣事宣傳並大規模徵求會員，待正式成立，取得一般人信仰後，再行實現前述的主張。主持此見者，為陶桂林君，附和者有江長庚，湯景賢諸君。著者的主張，處於緩急之間，只求會務能向前進展，兩者都是善策。所有我的見解是中庸的而又為前進的。</p>

<p>— 董大酉設計</p>
<p>久泰錦記營造廠承造</p>
<p>經過相當時期的籌備，各方的贊同與鼓勵，更激發了積極前進的精神。會務旣略具規模，唯一的工作便在完成向黨政主管機關備案的手續。經上海特別市黨部民訓會數度派員視察，認為合格，頒給許可設立證書。復遵照規定，向上海市敎育局呈請備案，經數次派員視察，始得邀准。十九年夏季在籌備時期，並編行會報一種，每週出版一次，專載籌備消息，傍及專門譯著等，分送各建築工程團體機關及個人，藉以宣傳會務，並使一般人知道我們的旨趣。現時的建築月刋，便種因於這雛形的會報。同年秋季，敵備諸委鑒於中等建築工程人才的缺乏，更設立職業補習夜校一所，公推湯景賢君為校長。授課時間每日下午七時至九時，編制分初級高級二部，每部各三年，修業年限共六年。開辦之初，先行招收初級部三班，入學者多為營造廠學徒，及建築工程事務所的繪圖員練習生等，在日間各有專職。</p>
<p>在籌備期內。先行編印會報舉辦夜校，這種工作是切合實際需要博得外界同情的。這時籌備會務，順利進行，各方請求加入為會員者，亦極為踴躍。備案的手續旣已成功，亟待結束籌備事宜，定期正式成立。當經籌備委員會議决，定期於二十年二月二十八日，假座西藏路寗波同鄉會，舉行成立大會。事前並呈請市黨部及市敎育局，派員出席指導及監選。</p>
<p>二十年二月二十八日下午二時，西藏路上，行人絡續，車轂相接，這些人都向寗波同鄉會進發，很顯明的是參加上海市建築恊會成立大會的。是日到會者，黨政機關有市黨部代表李寂然，市敎育局代表李大超，來賓有市工務局局長沈君怡董大酉吳邁，及全體會員等共到三百餘人。公推王臯蓀謝秉衡陳壽芝陶桂林杜彥耿五君為主席團。由主席王臯蓀致開會辭，杜彥耿報告本會籌備經過，次由市黨部市敎育局代表相繼致詞，繼為來賓演說。最後討論並通過會章，照章選舉職員，計執行委員九人，候補執行委員三人，監察委員三人，候補監察委員二人。執行委員當選者，為陶桂林，王臯蓀，江長庚，盧松華，湯景賢，杜彥耿，陳士範，陳壽芝，謝秉衡。候補執行委員當選者為孫德水，桂蘭蓀，徐虎臣。監察委員當選者為竺泉通，陳松齡，王法鎬。候補監察委員為方祥和，張裕田。當選執監委員繼卽宣誓就職，攝影散會。當日時事新報並出版上海市建築恊會成立大會特刋一大張。（我們本在那天計畫出版特刋一厚册，因編印不及，致延期一月出版。）當日晚並假座大東酒樓全廳，舉行盛大之歡宴，中外來賓及會員到者共五百餘人。席間有滬上建築界先進江裕生先生的哲嗣江長川君及吳邁律師等之演講，並殿以餘興，至深晚始盡歡而散。</p>
<p>三月二日舉行第一屆第一次執監委員會聯席會議，當經照章選舉王臯蓀江長庚湯景賢三君為常務委員，常委中並互選王臯蓀為主席。並分九股辦事，以專責成，計（總務）江長庚，（會計）陳壽芝，（調查）盧松華，（敎育）湯景賢，（學術及宣傳）杜彥耿，（材料）陶桂林，（設備）謝秉衡，王臯蓀，（介紹）陳士範等。同年七月，因會務進展，原有會所不敷應用，故遷至法租界蒲石路三一六號三一八號為會所。這年秋季，整個的中國，遭遇了歷史上稀有的水災，各省汜濫，幾成澤國，哀鴻遍野，慘不忍觀。這時本會大部份的精神，幾全費在籌欵救災的工作，這是個人及各團體應盡的責任，也是當時最急切的舉動。詎料救災未已，呼籲方殷，九月十八日邊省告警，於是又須兼顧到救國的工作。在這內憂外患，交相煎迫的環境中，欲求會務的進展，實感困難，保持現狀，已屬大幸了。</p>
<p>二十一年一月二十八日，本埠又發生不幸的衡突事件，經此騷動，號稱全國商業金融中心點的上海，陷於百業蕭條一厥不振的狀態中，謀利的生產機關，尙感不易維持，消費的團體事業，更有無從進行之感。附設夜校也因戰事關係，晚間宣佈戒嚴，師生往來不便，暫告停課，靜候時局敉平，再行恢復。這時的恊會，便入於無形停頓的境地，在進展的過程中，飽嘗着慘酷的滋味。</p>
<p>負責同人因承受全體會員的付旗，雖在極艱苦的環境中，仍在朝夕擘劃着會務的進行；同時因任期已滿，亟待照章改選。復以會所僻處法租界蒲石路，諸多不便，故於二十一年夏遷至南京路大陸商塲六樓六二○號現在會所，並闢六一六號至六一八號兩室為交誼廳，以供會員來會憇遊及招待之所。同時附設夜校亦遷至牯嶺路長沙路十八號，自秋季起召集學生，照常復課。</p>
<p>本會自二十一年夏遷至南京路大陸商塲辦事後，會務進行，重趨復興之象。同年九月，接奉上海市敎育局訓令，復由上海市政府轉咨國民政府敎育部，准予備案。於是向主管機關之立案備案手續，乃告大成，上海市建築恊會便列在全國合法團體之一。執監委員會當局復以任期已滿，亟應照章召集第二屆會員大會，報告會務狀况，討論進行事宜，並改選職員等，當經决議定期於十月九日在本會交誼廳舉行。屆期出席者，除全體會員外，並有市黨部代表毛霞軒，市敎育局代表聶海帆，蒞臨指導監選·本屆當選者，執行委員計為湯景賢，陶桂林，江長庚，謝秉衡，孫德水，杜彥耿，盧松華，王岳峯，陳壽芝，等九人。候補執行委員計為殷集之，賀敬第，陶桂松等三人。監察委員計為竺泉通，陳松齡，陳士範等三人。候補監察委員計為孫維明，王法鎬等二人。並於第一次執監委員會當會，推選陶桂林，謝秉衡，杜彥耿為常務委員，常務中並推陶桂林為主席。本屆職員自就任後，為欲多謀聚首機會，交換會務意見計，除按時舉行常會外，並每週舉行敘餐會，由執監委員十二人分別順序輪値。同年十一月，建築月刋創刋號問世。迨後服務部圖書室等相繼成立，增添了不少會務工作。</p>
<p>二十三年十月二十日，假座八仙橋靑年會九樓西廳，照章舉行第三屆會員大會，報告會務狀况，討論進行事宜，並改選職員等。出席者除會員外，有市黨部代表毛霞軒，市敎育局代表聶海帆，蒞會指導監選。主席湯景賢。行禮如儀後，報告會務修訂會章相繼完畢，最後改選職員結果，計執行季員為竺泉通，姚長安，陳松齡，應興華，陳壽芝，駕敬第，殷信之，孫德水，孫維明第九人。候補執行委員三人，為汪敏章，陳士範，王法鎬。監察委員三人，為江長庚，陶桂林，盧松華。候補監察委員二人，為湯景賢，杜彥耿。當晚並舉行聚餐會，到有來賓上海市敎育局局長潘公展，江亢虎，謝福生，許嘯天，及全體會員等。席間有潘江諸君演說，並殿以建築電影及大同樂會奏樂等餘興。第三屆第一次執監委員聯席會議，產生常務委員三人，為殷信之，盧興華，賀敬第；常務中並推殷君為主席。後以殷君常赴外埠公幹，未能常川駐滬，故懇辭常務委員兼主席職務，另行推選陳松齡為常務委員兼主席。並為增進會務工作效能起見，設立建築月刋刋務委員會與附設夜校校務委員會。推舉陳松齡，江長庚，竺泉通為刋務委員。應興華，賀敬第，姚長安為校務委員。本屆職員自就任後，服務精神較前更為煥發，一切設施也都上了軌道。但因為整個社會陷在不景氣的陰霾中，經濟衰落，民生凋疲，各種事業，同感着一蹶不振的煩悶。本會經費收入，僅能供給恊會本部一部份的開支，尙段籌措巨萬的經費，來維持月刋夜校等各種附屬事業。所以本屆職員除負責處理會務外，對於經濟的籌措，也着實費了不少的苦心。</p>
<p>截至現在止，本會附設正基建築工業補習學校（奉市敎育局令，加題專名。）舉辦畢業一次，畢業生七人，為劉家聲，王成　，黃榮芳，張善祥，吳浩振，朱運鈞，張瑤忠。畢業證書亦已由上海市敎育局騐印發還。各生均各有專職，學能應用，尙不失本會年斥鉅資數載培植的苦心。本年夏季舉辦第二屆畢業，學期尙未結束，成績未經審核，故畢業人數此時未能决定。建築月刋已出版至四卷二期。建築叢書方面，如建築辭典於本年六月底可以出版，聯樑算式付印完竣，現已發售。而負有國際盛譽的工程專家林同棪先生，在建築月刋陸續發表的克勞氏連架計算法等專著，祇須加以整理，亦可卽時付印。他如工程估價及營造學建築史等，迨在月刋發表完畢，亦擬單獨印行，列為叢書之一，在建築文化上勉盡些微的責任。</p>
<p>本會成立迄今，已有七載的歷史；成績如何，局外人自有評定，不便多所曉述。但作者認為前途的收穫，尙待現時的努力耕種，至於收獲的成績是否豐盛，我們且慢發問吧！</p>
<h3 id="c172">建築師應具之特點 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 袁宗燿</p>
<p>設計能力</p>
<p>建築師對於設計一途，頗關重要。彼積長時間之研究，對於各種建築之式樣，與夫各種建築之方法，能獲得專門之學問，而不為他人所佔者，亦其宜也。建築師對於任何建築物空間之分配，均使其利便：故其分配之每一空間，於形式上，於大小上，皆能盡善盡美。至於各部份之建築，如何分配，始可佔得最利益之地位，而其全是部計畫，亦始可達到，又建築師所應知也。再者，彼繪圖所建之屋，出入口方便，屋主實深受惠，凡缺乏智巧之建築師則不然矣：常使一建築之某部多佔空間，或某部少佔，或某部之位置與計畫不符，或使通行處多佔空間，或少佔：如此種種均予使用者之不便，或不適合。技術優良之建築師則對於各方面皆加盧及，故上說缺點，均可免去也。</p>
<p>從認為重要之經濟立塲而言，則一方有限制之地位，建築師能為佔有者解决一切疑難，而能精密計畫所需之容積；不使一立方尺之面積，稍有不顧，而不使其達於最有用處之途徑。蓋增加一立方尺之空間，則費金錢，若棄置而不施於正用，則正與耗費金錢相等。今建築師能運用空間而不使之棄廢，則授吾人之利大矣。</p>
<p>應具觀察材料及建築法之知識</p>
<p>採用比較優良之材料與用具於建築中，並用良法以建築之，此二者在建築</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>師應時時表出其特色與獨到也。此種特色與獨到，對於建築師之重要，固無待言矣；要之當其受訓練時，及入製圖室開始製圖時，卽須研習此種特色與獨到。如彼觀察各種　築之材料，察其外形如何，考其能否經久，然後再思索若一富有經騐者在此，則將如何　擇並特定之各種建築材料，以實現其原有計畫。建築開始時，彼應監督並觀察材料如何放置，如克適當；日後當復核對前所用之方法，與所取之材料，是否相符。</p>
<p>材料商常供給各種材料與貨樣，則建設築師亦可常與彼業或其他代表時相接觸。暇時亦可參觀工廠，對於泥磗磁磗，木料大理石汕布等之製造方法，亦得領略於胸中。此外復從新聞報，建築刋特及當時關於建築之談話中，彼亦可得一切專門事業之菁華，卽如吾國（指美國）標華試騐局，（U.S.B.of　Standard）與其他之著名工業學校實騐室所傳出之比較試騐，彼亦可取其精粹，作為參考。總之，彼須如販買最優良之材料商，吾人僱用之，彼卽為吾人之販買商，使吾人得優良之材料，並使吾人節省經濟。</p>
<p>建築師所定之材料與用具，增色為優良而合用者，彼必通知材料商以何種材料，在建築時始可收預定之效果。彼按其方針，監督工程，有時亦有請可靠之助手代之者。當建築成就時，吾人必滿意建築特之牢固與經入，而他日卽命名或須修理，其費亦微。蓋其基礎鞏固，天花板乾燥，屋　牢固，墻壁不傳寒熱濕氣，地板常乾而並不縫裂，天花板經久而不退色，樓梯便於上下，而無鬧聲。總之，建築注意一切事項，而得如此效果者，無非為吾人之享樂與平安，並使吾人節省經濟，無需時時修理也。</p>
<p>應具審美觀念</p>
<p>關於建築之第三要點，卽為美觀。建築師應以優良之計劃，而作建築適宜，及如何恃其關於建築材料上之知識，而可担何在築成之後，堅牢經久，已詳上述。現欲討論者，乃為建築師之圖樣。凡一完成之建築，必須具有美質：而此種美質，亦卽建築師所獨佔，藉使其特出於其他以營建築事業者。良工程師與建築師，能知如何建築優良，甚至亦可發展其能力，而達經濟的與選　輯的計畫；然建築師能具有充分之美的觀念，則未之見。此種美的觀念；余不敢斷定每個建築師皆能佔有，而並能達最高程度；然余敢寂靜每個建築師，對於美的觀念到少亦須有相當之程度。故有志於建築師者，當須具有製圖與愛美之觀念。彼平時所思，大槪為比率，平均，準合，音各，色調，光綫，經　等各種槪念：終日又沉湎於古代之　築，丹青，雕刻，音樂，文學，戲曲之　，此　事者，皆有「美」字在其中間，久之，則建築師佔有美的觀念，固無定　也。建築師能區別優良美惡，並能運用此理於建築之中，則　其　樣所成之建築，宜乎能　出一般無訓練及無智巧職工之建築也。</p>
<p>關於美之觀念，吾人至少亦可領略一點。設有二物於此，任吾人選擇，吾人必選春較優者，蓋無疑義。若吾人選擇衣服什器或汽車時，雖各類物件之各點相同，而結果吾人所選者，率為較美觀者。選擇物件旣如此，則屋字何獨不然；蓋華屋美椽，吾人所願具也。建築師若於建築特上加以美的點綴，則屋宇價値之增高，隣舍之住房亦將興盛，此屋宇之租價，亦因是而增加。故由優良圖樣築成之屋宇，與一較劣圖樣築成之住房，雖處同一位置同一地點，若出售時，其價必較昂，可斷言也。銀行家對於有美觀的屋宇，常作抵押放頂交易，蓋彼等深知良建築師經手之屋宇，其價値必有可觀，一朝賣出時，亦必易售。經營地產業者，常曰在同一便利地點之房屋，在出租時，建築美觀者必較易於劣者，由上言之，則美之特質，具有商業上之價値，並可超過牢固與便利之特質。此種特質之供給，除建築師外，其誰能知。</p>
<p>應具建築法規之知識</p>
<p>美國各州邦，有若干法律與常規，均有關於建築者。故為築師者，對於此等法規，必當瞭解，使業主不致受無論何種捐失也。</p>
<p>現今各州設立建築註册與領照之法律，其所以如此者，乃使一船冒充建築師之徒，不得冒名頂替，致公衆蒙其弊害。此法載明建築師須受相當之訓練，並禁止一般無相當資格者，不得稱為建築師。故一般建築師，須經註册而認為合法。在註册法中，常載有各城鎭村之建築法規，如建築費計畫費等，不得超過某數之外；若有超過，則建築師必須呈報。現在各州之無此法規者，亦多採用之。</p>
<p>所謂建築法規者，卽指各地之舊規，而各地亦互不相同。故甲地欲建築房屋，必須甲地之法規；乙地若建築房屋，同時亦須合乙地之法規。此外仍有分區或地段法，亦與建築房屋有關者。再如各州法，保險法，契約法，及各州各地之公安法，建築皆當充分瞭解。此外如聯邦專利法，亦當研習之；蓋遇採用某種式樣時，而此種式樣為某人所發明，並操有專利權者，必先納專利費，然後始可採用。比如欲建一低式櫃台之　行房屋，建築師當知此為專利式，非納專利費者不能採用之。若欲建築若干　之汽車房　，上下不用電梯，而　　　之須沿法，不知此式又為專利，卽專利者　此建築無直接關係，業主亦非　某專利不可。付專利費者，雖屬業主之債任；而使業主知此現任者，則建築師之　也。故為建　師者亦須明瞭建築法規如各　專利制度等。</p>
<p>應具承攬者之知識</p>
<p>建築師如有承攬者之知識，則吾人招工投標時，彼决可定何者合格，何者不合格。若吾人听其規勸，則一切關於不良工程，惡劣材料及發生糾紛之事，皆可避免。建築師恃其知識與經騐，能為吾人介紹誠實之承攬者。此等人對於工作均負責任，並不願敗壞自身之名譽。為建築師者，在此等人索價中，擇其可靠而價較低者，使其承造之，則產主一方面對於建築師無庸絲毫顧慮，卽可得圓滿之結果；而他方面又可節省經濟，甚至所省之數，超出給建築師之報酬。由是觀之，則建築師對於吾人，其　不亦大哉！（譯　美國Pencil　Poinl雜誌）</p>
<h3 id="c173">建築師之職務 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 宗</p>
<p>凡一　築之成功，其　　　程序，非常　　，茲從　　築　　　商酌建築之進行以到於完成，將　中步驟，略陳述之。</p>
<p>吾人如谷建築某種工程，當先至建築師　，告以建築式樣，建築位置，內室佈置：並確定建築工程之多少，最喜之式樣，以及所預備之建築費等種種問題，總之關於一切建築情形，皆當明白告知。建築之大體，固需與之商量，而建築上之微末問題，亦當與之討論；蓋彼之本分，在使屋主方面滿意其工作，若不巨細皆知，曷能盡其職守？若在恊商計宜時，吾人所需之要為年或事物，若在建築師感覺並不重要或不宜者，此時當以其知識經騐，解釋究竟，並詳述其利弊；同時屋主方面能聽其忠告，一若醫師或律師然，則亦不失為知者矣。</p>
<p>當建築師商權進行時，必能提議多件事物，出吾人臆料之外者，此種提議，皆為吾人所需求者，亦卽最完善最新穎之建築方案也，故吾人當樂從之。建築師對於建築位置情形，現在與將來之地租價値，運輪關係問題，旁及清渠，煤氣，自來火，熱度，電氣，均得從長討論。若認為必要時，彼卽可偕同業主觀察段之位置，則彼可直接知其究竟。總之，在彼能繪構圖樣之前。彼與業主必有多次之接觸與討論，然後始行着筆。最初者亦僅作一草創計畫，及一外形圖（Exterior　Design）而已。此外形圖與原計畫相府，而其形式美觀，調色勻和，能使見者同意歡悅；而業主在此時亦可窺見及評定建築師之　學矣。</p>
<p>如若欲估計建築達完成後究竟需價若干，在此草創計畫時期，其確數殊雖逆料。卽或建築師能算出每立方尺之需價，而再預測建築完成後全立方尺數相計逄，而得一估計之數目；但在建築完成後，與其實在支出之價値相比較，能與先後之預算相符合者，實未多覲。一般承攬者已有精細圖樣及各各說明書，於其投標索價時，欲便其標價皆不出百分之十或百分之二十之互相差額，已不可能，况事先无精细圖親及說明書乎？此種草創計畫及外形圖，僅堪供給吾人參看，以知吾人是否贊成其原有計畫，抑有所改變而已！</p>
<p>吾人觀此草創計畫及著色草圖，則可於腦際得一全部建築之印象，並指出各種建築式樣之利弊，共同討論。直至草圖修改完善，合乎　主之意而後已。如是，則雙方同意，而建築師亦可定　進行之趨向。在討論之時期中，吾人關於此建築，如在合理範圍內，可隨吾入之必向而有所　　，　至若干次數，亦無　碍。若一切之最初商　　能切實施行，　對於某完全計畫之實現，可减許多　煩　不　？總之，吾人當　　於先，不可　率從事，蓋事人之所　　，均欲付　工作圖樣與說明書也。</p>
<p>不在工作圖　內之　　，名之　「額外條件」。建　師與承攬者，　不　此種條件之存在，蓋他日之參　　由　而起。故吾人當商權時，最好顧慮　　，無微不至，不使條件中有所　列，而免後患也！</p>
<p>及至吾人贊同此項計畫，而由計畫而成之建築，其所坱之費，適在吾人本意所定者範圍之內時，則建築師始進行其最後工作圖樣與說明書。此二者極為重要，蓋承攬者卽根據此而標價也。</p>
<p>在此工作圖樣與說明書中，載有怕以給承攬者。此種文件頗為重要，並須明白表示，否則承攬者不能計算精確，勢必至索價較高；蓋恐他日爭執，致遭　失也。如是則　者金錢，不無耗費。故一切工作文件，必　　過工程師　　考核，並可免去索債太高之　。</p>
<p>吾人對於建築之責任，不僅通知建築關於建築之地位　合理之建築條件，卽最初之草圖，工作圖樣，說明書，及各種建議，與承攬者所訂之合同，及其他關於建築師及屋主之文件，均須加意　　，耐心從事。要之，建築師絕不以無關係之事與業主相煩擾：彼所欲　討論者皆彼受吾人之託而欲為吾人服務者也。彼之工作圖樣及說明書，卽建築師對承攬所表示之言論，亦卽建築師自已之思想也！</p>
<p>工作圖樣旣非學科，又非草圖，亦非圖畫，乃為作之圖樣。優良之工作圖樣，其給承攬者之各種指示，直與所需者相同，絕不稍差。此種力樣必須清潔簡明，尤須精確而無虛泛條件；雇者與承攬者之合同，均基於此。其中包括最小而易見之規樣，如基礎，地板，　，四邊高度，以及期全建築各部之描寫。由此規樣中，承攬者可估計各種之價値，而作一精確之材料價値表，及彼須付之一切工作價値，則彼可索一最低之價値。此種索價，大槪除料與工價外，可獲利十分之一。若此工作圖樣不良，內中條件不明，為防他日之捐失及不明材料之價値起見，索價必高。改良建築師所備之工作圖樣與說明書，可省吾人之金錢不少。</p>
<p>說明書為一種文字表明一切指示主針之文件；此種文字之表示在工作圖樣中所付闕如者。此英說明書必須簡明而無狐疑處，其中之一切名詞，當與工兒圖樣內之名詞一致；關於材料之品質及工作之程度，必須明白表示。當擬此種說明書時，須參看各種材料目試騐，各種材料樣本，並與材料商接見，比較市塲價値，决定何種材料對於此建築最為合宜；總之彼卽充吾人購買材料之經理者也。</p>
<p>工作圖樣與說明書之繁簡，恒與建築式樣成正比例。譬如醫院住宅或敎堂貨棧與汽車站等建築費雖同，而圖樣則前者繁複而後者簡易。故建築師需費之多少，常以建築之形式為準則。同為一千元之建築物。若其形式複雜，則索費必多，反之則索費低廉：故依照圖樣之簡複而定索價之多少，實為最公允之辦法也。</p>
<p>當吾人對於工作圖樣旣　贊同，卽行招工承攬。按普通情形，建築師旣為吾人之代表，彼常招致五人或五人以上之承攬者，來此預備投標。通常彼提出若干位可靠之承　者，吾人如有熟識包工，亦可　入，將工作圖樣與說明書，用藍色印就分發各投標者。各投標者卽以此為根據而估計之，此建築總價（包括包工者對此建築應會之　本及應獲之利益）於特定期前，將此標價封好，投入標箱，則建築師為表明公正起見，請業主同來開標檢騐。旣開之後，吾人常見彼等有精詳之工作圖樣與說明書，而其標價則互各縣殊，相差甚巨。究其原因，蓋由於工作之經濟辦法，作工之方法及材料之購買能力等，有以致之。再則普通承攬者之索價包括一切小包商對彼之索價；承攬者包其全部工程，而將此建築之各部份另行損毀標於小包商，如建築內之鐵管，電氣，熱水管等，故彼等標價，卽大不相同。普通承攬者卽承攬　水兩工，兼鑒地穴與根脚等，共他工作則由小包商等承攬之。此等小包商亦與之訂立合同，同負工作上之責任者也。</p>
<p>關於投標一事已詳述之。惟猶有一事不得已於言者，卽投標者不願以較劣之材料混用於建築之中，則其索價無論低至若何程度，吾人亦可任期承攬。然吾人以為彼之標價太低，而投標者似不懷好意，由拒絕其標價亦吾人權力所及也。標價議定之後，則建築師為吾人與投標者立一合法之建築合同，使吾二造之問，毫無疑問，對於一切工作情形與條件，均能明白瞭解，則他日不致發生任何爭執矣。有時建築師亦使承攬者必須履行特種條件，否則卽加以罰欵：此種事實成可影響工作之價値，而使之稍有高昂，然可免去承攬乾不負責之弊。總之，若承攬者　于此種特殊條件之下，則吾人對於建築之各方面可以無慮矣！</p>
<p>迨此等事務辦妥後，則將此項圖樣交與地方政府之建設處，請求考核，並請頒給建築執照。然後承攬者招齊工人，並　集材料，開始工作，而建築師同時亦須預備詳細圖樣矣。</p>
<p>工作圖樣大槪包括一切關於建築之條件。然為求承包商小包商工作人員等確實明瞭此建築所需各種條件起見，則建築師仍需補充詳細圖樣，用以分給此建築之當事者，如是則彼等對於材料之供給，材料之形成等，無絲毫錯誤與延　。此種圖樣之數目與範圍，以該項建築之繁簡大小為依歸。此如建築一小規模之屋，則補充詳細之圖樣，其數目必較少；若建一公共之　書樓等，則此種圖樣必較多矣。當建築時行詳細分類圖樣時，對於木質之收縮與膨脹，建築中之移動部分以及其他等顯示不良情形時，建築師必籌劃如何免除此種弊病。在此圖樣中，伊對於雕刻之裝飾品若能繪製精確，必能使建築物增加美觀。有時建師於事先預備一木製模型之裝飾品，然後再令工匠按照模型仿製之，以求精確美觀也。</p>
<p>建築圖樣可以明白解答一切建築上之疑雖問題。此種圖樣不僅可减少製造工價，亦且可增加建築上之便利與安適。比如樓梯壁橱書架及其他用具等，若將其形式與位置明白顯示，則造成之後，必能利便與舒適。各項用具之裝置雖云在圖樣上明白表明，然究因埁模太小，在實行裝置時仍須由工作者自行精算。然如各項裝置均由建精詳計算，則亦不致發生錯誤矣；且一切均可用比例計算，更覺便利也。至於窗飾檐　烟囱等等必须能久经風雨而不剝蝕。當此建築工程進行時，在詳細圖樣中，各事皆有預備，可免臨時忽促，故金錢與時間兩者均不致浪費也。</p>
<p>建築者雖有說明書及詳細圖樣，以及一切關於建築之細微問題之解說，若欲擔保其進行工作時毫無問題發生，總不可得。故建築時或其代表仍須在工作進行時，常常監督。若在大工程進行時，建築師必須請一監工者常川監督。如此工程為幾個承攬者包辦，而無一總承攬者時，則此監工者更不可省去，在雇主雖屬多費金錢，然工作効率太增，不無給雇主以便利。在小工程中，承攬者之監督代表，其責任必察看工過中之各項事件之進行是否與建築時之表册相符，或建築师或其代表時來核會所用之材料，與進行之工作。當來視察時，有時亦稍加修正：而此種修正處除建築師之受過若干年訓練者外，他人恐難以知道也。又此種修正，若建築師不加提出，則工作者亦卽忽略也。</p>
<p>建築師察看材料與工作是否合於本來工作規定，此種服務對于吾人實最有價値與功效。蓋各承攬者忠實為懷，不願作欺騙行為與忽略工作然自私為人之恒情，總之用較劣材料參用期問，以謀獲利，猶如賣者之與買者也。建築師則不然：彼所處之地位與吾人　。彼竭望建築成功，能盡　盡美，與吾人之初旨相同。蓋此建築物能影響彼之　用，故彼亦不願發生許多枝節，而有不滿意之結果也。以是彼督促承攬者盡其能力以完此工程。視察並不能擔保免除不良工作，故必監督。無經騐之雇主常給建築工程與標價最低者，並聲言該承攬者能給其優良之工作，而藉此不聽建築師之忠告也。</p>
<p>顧建築師因期他職務，僅能負視察之責，而不能負監督之責，吾人知之詳矣。照普通習慣，該工程埁模較小，僅須視察，則建築師可依照習慣而行。惟必須監督時，則須請一監工者，其薪金雖由雇圭支付，而建築師同時亦須　視</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>寨之責也。</p>
<p>一切建築工程，除規樓極小者外，監工者决不可缺。建築師必勸吿雇主招請該項人員，建築師所以如此者，無非爲欲造福于雇主也。在雇主與承攬者起初訂立合同時，卽須規定付標價之方法。若有一部份工作完成，而承攬者如求付價時，則建築師當出證明書，證明該部份工作已獲圓滿效果，則雇主始行付發。令當承攬者要求付價時，建築師當視察此次工作是否滿意，是否按照所規定各條件進行，然後始加發給證明書。在起初承攬者卽將材料與工作之標價，通盤籌算，而分做幾期，使雇主支付，於是彼亦可付其他小承攪者。此張計算單交建築師，而現在建築師出立證明書使雇主付欵，亦卽根據此單。當彼呈此單于建築師時建築師當審愼周詳，並使最初及中部付欵不可太多，以防不測；彼所以如此行者，亦卽爲謀雇主之利益而已！（譯自美國Pencil　Point雜誌）</p>
<h3 id="c174">對於改進中國式建築的商榷 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 杜彥耿</p>
<p>屋面　中國式建築最顯著的地方，厥惟屋面。輝煌的琉璃瓦，獨特的獸吻，　脊上裝着立的臥的走獸人物：屋面四邊的撓角與簷下的斗拱等，在在都表示着十足的中國作風。所以在這民氣消沉的時候，應把中國固有的文化特別的搬演出來，這是含有醍　灌頂喚起民衆的意思，而與各大書局的翻印古版書及民族掃墓等，有着同樣的意義。但是食洋不化與食古不化，同爲世之詬病。因之處今之世，一方固要保持吾們文化素有的精神，一方更要趨合世界潮流，才是正當的途徑。試以中國式屋面而論，屋下本用木架，便是簷際的斗拱，也用木構。現在因爲木質不能持久，又易着火，所以悉取鋼筋水泥代之。但是昂橡斗拱等的式樣，依舊與木製的完全相同。外面並施髹漆彩繪，甚或貼金。更因水泥容易發潮，兼含鹼性，故於未施彩繪之前，先塗避水膠漆等重牀疊架削足適履的工作。此單就鋼筋水泥出面部份而論，他如當作屋架與屋板的鋼筋水泥。中國屋面因爲坡度少了不好看，所以務要陡峻，才能顯出端莊的儀態。比如中國廟宇的屋面，遠遠望去，不見得怎樣高，但是踏進殿門，要看端坐中央的大佛頭面時，非把　子昻酸不可。於此可以想見這屋面是高得可以了。現在因爲屋架與屋面，改用鋼筋水泥，更因鋼筋水泥本身的載重關係，與中國式房屋應廡的跨度寬大，故屋架的構造猶如一座橋梁，屋面的工艱費巨，於此可以想見。但是這不過是鋼筋水泥屋架與屋面的一欵。他若琉璃瓦屋脊，獸吻，走獸等，又是一番加工費料重牀疊架的工作，殊背建築的三項原則，卽經濟美觀與實用是。中國式屋面的不經濟，已如上述。中國式屋面，自簷口以至屋脊，因爲坡度高峻，所以屋下的地位很大。但是這很大的地位，不能派作正當的用處，便是不實用的鐵瞪。購到中國式屋面的不美觀，一定有人不服氣，要責難作者，則且聽分解。凡美觀云者，一定要有一個時代性，在後再論在這一時代中所謂美或不美。簡單的說，以前中國的婦女要纏足，纏得越小越不能走路，便算是美。試問現在見了小足，要起怎樣的感想？更如婦女頭上的珠頭面，身上的補服，腰下的百襇裙，裙上繫着一倏一條的繡帶，繡帶下端更繫着響鈴。試問現在見了這種裝束的婦女，又要興起怎樣感想？這都是幾十年前的事，不去提他。現在且說吾們蒙古同胞婦女頭上的挿戴，拖拖累累，琳琅滿目的東西，吾們見了雖不能直截說他不美，但是美的疑問，是一定要加上去的。那末綜上數說，美是要隨時代進退的話，是確定了。然則中國式屋面的所謂美，在現世界頃刻萬變的汹潮中，能姑定脚跟到千年不變麼？非難者至此，也必日不能。是故已知不能厮守，終至改變，那末不要再被傳統思想拘泥着不向前進，應當急起直追。凡是大建築，一律改用鋼筋水泥平屋面，因爲平屋面實在是經濟又復實用。更加所需材料完全可用國貨，如水泥則國產豐富，鋼筋則已有國貨。雖然出貨不多，但一經共同提倡，出貨定可增加。黃沙同石子，不容說不必向外洋購辦，在國內各處，幾於俯拾卽是。用爲壳子板的木料，只要建築師在說明書內，規定用建松或是其他中國木料作壳子板，撑頭用桶木，則外國木材雖較中國爲賤，但經說明書規定，自必樂採國材。建築師對於這點，想來終可盡責。如此平屋面的構築，不必需用外材。惟平屋面上要舖牛毛毡與柏油，必用外貨。其實這些全可不用，祗要於澆搗水泥時，稍加注意於混拌均勻，澆製緊密，中間無一絲隙縫。並於澆平後當卽用水泥細沙粉光，則此平屋面可不用牛毛毡，也無滲漏之慮。若因水泥平屋面傳熱的利害，那問題更容易解决，祗消在粉光的屋面上，舖一層黃沙，壘砌一皮空心磚，磚面澆煤屑水泥，再加水泥細沙粉光。如此熱炎被空心磚所隔，不能直傳屋下室中，室內自屬凉快。經過上面的說明，平屋面的經濟實用，諒已明瞭。只有美觀同中國式的作風，當另加解說。關於美觀這一點，上而旣已說過，是要依時代作進退的。現代的趨向，是側重在淡裝素抹，那些濃艷盛飾，是已不合時宜了。故欲求美觀，可於壓簷墦上稍加點飾，並用中國圖案，則美觀與中國式作風，於此都已迎刃而解。他如在立體的建築物上，加蓋一頂中國屋面，全是裝腔作態般不自然的表現。希望建築同人痛下革命精神，不再拘囿一隅才是。</p>
<h3 id="c175">建築工業 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 上海市建築恊會</p>
<p>建築工業較諸其他任何工業爲扼要偉大，自不待言。然常人每不見此，致使生產落後，而向外購置大宗建築材料，歷年漏巵，其數驚人。單就洋松一項，運銷滬地，及由滬轉運內地者，年達三萬萬尺，價値國幣一千九百餘萬之巨。他如鋼鐵，玻璃，水管，暖氣片，爐子及電料等建築所需之材料，不勝枚舉。蓋建築者，集合各種工業之大成，非特於工商業獨具權威，抑且於一民族之健康，繁榮，曆史，文化等，關係綦切。茲試舉數端，以槪其餘。</p>
<p>建築之於民族健康　國人能享受居室之美者，百不一二。一般平民，多蟄居陋室，僅堪容膝。至若赤貧之家，甚有巢居穴處者。此自係若輩經濟能力薄弱所致，此種陋室，外面旣無排洩汚水之溝渠，又乏暢亮之窗　；至於高爽之地板，不滲雨水之屋面，不透風雪之牆垣，更無論矣，而貧民侷居於此種不良之環境中，其生活幾非人類所能忍受，影響其智慧健康，自不待言。加以嚴冬之季，雨雪交加；旣屆夏令，蚊蚋叢生；疫癘以起，死亡相繼。此種禍害，表面觀之，雖貧民首當其衝；然國家元氣，因此亦受重大之喪失。蓋民爲邦本，古有明訓：貧富貴賤，同屬人倫，對於此種赤貧無吿之人民，憐惜不暇，何可遺忽。故歐美當局對於貧民居屋，特別注意。若英之剷除陋屋運動，別建新屋以相撫容。美之建設無烟區域，全村四千餘戶，或藉電熱舉炊。是皆以國家之力量，改善貧民之生活者也。吾國當局，年來對此亦漸加注意，如平民邨之興建等，皆爲惠及庶黎之明徵也。</p>
<p>至於稍有資產者，營建居室，莫不以龐大是尙。九開間以及較進深之房屋，不足爲奇。是以人少屋犬，室內淸潔秩序，自屬不能顧及。蛛網密結，蛇鼠藏匿，陰氣森沉，有　於蒙庭衛生者殊大。究其　結，構建此種大厦，無非爲欲便利婚喪喜事計，得以舖張揚厲，藉此炫耀，至若圖謀安適，非其初顧也。至若通都大邑，因地價較貴，遂有所謂西式住屋者。然究其內容，則非中非西，不倫不類，形成一種畸形之建築物。有時謹防盜賊，鐵楞森嚴，儼若囹　；幽居其中，雖得保障却失自由。故國人多數之居處，非簡陋難堪，卽笨拙異常。欲求一樸素雅潔，切合實用之住屋，實不多覯。民族之健康，繫於居室之安適，國人對此，宜三加注意焉。</p>
<p>建築之由工商業　建築者，集各種工業之大成，前已言之。試觀鋼鐵工業之熔冶，鋼梁鋼筋錮板鋼網及其他鋼料等，此種工業雖極偉大，然就大體言，亦不過屬於建築工業之一部耳。他若開採石礦，鑿取石灰石，燒鍊石灰，水泥；又如花崗石雲石之採取等，此種工業不可不謂爲偉大，然大部份除供應建築一業外。無發展之可能。此外如森林鋸木廠水陸運輸交通等，無不與建築工業唇齒相依，攸關利害，工商業與建築具有不可分離之關係，可見一斑。若建築事業呆滯不振，此種工商業卽首受打擊也。</p>
<p>建築之於歷史　建築之於歷史，關係最切。我人考查史蹟，亦惟徵之建築，最屬信確。前代之建築，可作今人之史實，而今人之建築，更可留諸後人之借鑑。萬里長城之堅固雄偉，於此可知秦時禦敵之設施。現在一般考古家在斷碣殘碑中過其生活，無非欲從此得信實之史料也。</p>
<p>建築之於文化　一國文化之表微，有藉書籍圖畫者，有藉戲劇音樂者；雖能各盡其表現文化之功能，但表現之方法，究以建築物爲顯著，易於引人注意。他如彫刻彩繪等，在在顯示建築文化之結晶者也。</p>
<p>總之，建築爲一種綜合之技藝，與各方面有多角之關係。試以戲院一項而論，容集電氣，冷熱氣，聲，美術，土木，溝管，水渠，光綫，衛生及安全等設備而成，於此可見其組合之複雜與工價之偉大。從事建築業者，均應慶幸自已爲偉大事業之一員，同時亦應明瞭已身之責任，不辱所負之使命也。</p>

<p>— 緝</p>
<p>年來建築事業之發達，誠有一日千里之勢，而對於各種建築物外觀之雄偉內部裝璜之都麗，種種設計，旣周且密，日新月異，靡有止境。惟有建築物上觀瞻所繫之外圍，迄無改良方法，歷觀海上諸大公共館舍，私人住宅，精美絕倫之大廈，古木陰深之園林，凡需用建築外圍者，類皆墨守舊法，上焉者砌以水泥磚牆，下焉者仍以竹籬圍之。前者不甚經濟，後者旣不美觀，又不耐用，然則欲求一替代之物，而無二弊者，舍鐵絲網籬莫屬。</p>
<p>鐵絲網籬在歐美各國，舉凡公共館舍，私人住宅，運動球塲，車站，機器，工廠，貨棧，門窗等，均採用已久，因其質料之耐用，外表之美觀，裝置可隨形變化，兼可防禦意外，合乎建築物上外園及保障之用者，實無過於斯。惜乎國內建築家，罕有注意及此，推其原委不外乎向外洋訂購，室礙綦多，蓋其籬眼之大小，鐵絲之粗細，尺度之高低，裝置式樣之變更以其籬柱材料之配置，在在均須於事前有精確之計算，少有錯誤，卽不合需用或所需太少，洋行又不願訂辦，而其價値之昻貴，更出人意料之外耳。</p>
<p>上海楊樹浦臨靑路，公勤鐵廠，已有此項出品，如有需用該項網籬者，可直接向該廠詢問。</p>
<h3 id="c177">華親水泥地磚之特點 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>一室之組成，須具有鮮明之天頂，柔和之牆壁，美　之地面，理想中之地面，應具有下列五特點，　地面應具誘人性，凡人一入室內，必先與地面接觸，且接觸較任何部分爲多，故地面所用材料，應與牆壁天頂顏色調和，具有藝術意義，使人一入室中，頓覺心神怡快，不生倦容，　地面所舖材料，須有抵抗外來磨擦之能力，務使用之愈久，則地面愈堅，數干年後視之，與新鋪時無分軒輕，　地面材料，應有永不退色之優點，凡劣等材料，一經鋪用，卽有變色之虞，雖四壁裝潢美麗，但全室美觀，已爲之减色不少，　地面宣採容易淸潔之材料，如有汚垢，可以隨時洗灌，長保衛生，　地面應鋪用耐久之材料，使一次所付之值，永遠不再增加，簡言之，卽以後不須再付修理地面之費也。</p>
<p>上述五特點，爲理想地面所必需，而能應此需求者，則華新磚瓦公司所出水泥地磚（俗稱花磚）尙焉。</p>
<p>華新公司所出水泥地磚，興市上所銷花磚，質地花色，均不相同，華新地磚，原料採用上等，所需機器，壓力最高，花紋顏色，澆入甚厚，用之愈久，磚面愈見光潔，卽數十年後觀之，仍不改其美麗鮮艷，用華新地磚，其費用除水泥地面外，較之任何舖地材料爲低，而共耐久性，容或過之。</p>
<p>我國水泥地磚，製造雖不久，但在歐美，早已風行各處歷數十年，閉在古巴哈代那等處，有在一百年前舖用者，至今面同全新，毫無損壤，近今歐美大建築中，採用水泥地磚，此之他種材料爲多，是可見水泥地磚之用，較之任何舖地材料，並不多讓，至粗製濫造之花磚，則又當別論矣。</p>
<p>上海一埠，自有水泥地磚以來，亦已二十年，市塲銷沉，銷路呆滯，實受粗製濫造之影響，今華新地磚，於不景氣中，崛起發行，得建築界之推行，行銷之速，殊堪驚異，不有其立塲，焉得如是。</p>
<p>華新地磚，製造採用不退色之顏料，及最佳之白水泥，用新式之汽壓機，最光滑之模型，極美觀之花模，每方需壓力二噸餘，以如是新頴之方法，始製成尺寸準確，磚面光潔，質地堅實，色澤鮮明，花紋淸朗。省費耐久之地磗，然後浸入水中，以相當時間，再放入相當溫度中，待其乾燥，便成理想中之地磚。</p>

<p>創辦</p>
<p>振業石棉製造廠，創於民國二十三年，廠址設天津特別二區大昌與胡同，廠址佔地一畝半，資本二十萬元，係股份公司性質經理爲周錦庭副理李興輔王星九，全廠工人一百二十餘名，機器大小各種有四十部，爲中國規模最大之石棉製造廠，二十四年春接盤天津石棉公司，中華石棉公司，及魁業隆石棉廠，實力越發充足，周李二君鑑於以往國產石棉物品，大都乖劣，又兼舶來品，年來傾銷日甚，每年漏巵，數極可觀，故悉心研究，添設機械，改良各種製品，所製各品，與外貨毫無軒輊，頗蒙各廠所，全國各鐵路及建築界所贊許。</p>
<p>礦區</p>
<p>礦區在河北省淶源縣，產量頗豐，全國石棉原料，除四川一小部未開採外，完全仰住振業石棉礦供給，領有礦照，自行開採，常常有三百名，除供給全國需要外，出口數量也是很大，全國也只有這一個礦開採的。</p>
<p>工廠</p>
<p>廠址寬大，全廠分造紙科，織布科，織繩科，磚管科，紡綫科，礦科，彈軋科，考工科等餘如成品科，化騐科，裝璜科等，寫字間方面分會計科，庶務科，採購科，批發科，出口科衛生科等，各科設料長一人，辦事員數人，工師八十名工徒四十名，分日夜工兩班，全廠工人職員均穿中山服裝，一切設備頗具規模，很足以表現工廠之精神。</p>

<h3 id="c183">廣吿的戰術 <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 傅學勤</p>
<p>凡是工商界中的人都會知道廣吿在生意競爭中是佔着極重要地位的。每一個商品製造所，每一家公司·洋行·商店，廣吿費都要佔其支出的最大部分。我們曾聽到許多富有經騐的商家說，如果要做兩萬元的生意，那便應該拿出一萬元來作廣吿費。這的確是經騐之談。因爲目前無論那一種貨物都有許多類似的種類，假使你有某一種很好的貨品，如在廣吿方面宣傳不普遍，那一般人是不會知道的，當然也就更不會來買你的這種貨品了。</p>
<p>然而，廣吿宣傳也必須要做得得法，才能以最低限度的廣吿費，獲得最大的效果。同時，業務的是吾能繁榮，也往往要以廣吿宜傳是吾得法來判定，有時貨品的優劣甚至都是决要的；現代的工商業競爭，主要的便是在貨物的品質和廣吿的宣傳上來競賽。所以，各工商業家對於廣吿的宣傳法都用盡心機，特別講求；一般規模比較大一點的工商業幾乎都特別設有廣吿科，不惜以重金聘請了許多專門的技術人材來特別研究廣告的宣傳法。</p>
<p>廣吿的種類是很多的，它的作法更是千差萬別，我們在這里當然無法詳談，只能大概的舉幾點重要的來講。</p>
<p>首先，廣吿的作用當然第一是要一般人知道你所要賣出的貨品。這除了多化廣吿費，在各處作廣吿，以各種方法宣傳外，主要的是當用簡短有力的文字表現出貨品的特質，使一般人在不知不覺中對這貨品發生很深的長久的印象。依據人們一般的性情，大概都不高興看過長的文字，特別是與國家社會無大關係的廣吿，過長了允其少人看；所以，沒有萬分必要時，廣吿文字是不宜多的；最好是能選定幾個字的標語來表明貨品的特質，使一般人都能很容易的記下它。如「百齡機有意想不到之效力」，「明星花露香水越陳越香」，……便是很好的例證。</p>
<p>復决，在廣吿中，圖畫也和文字一樣重要。一個美好的廣吿必然是以能引人注意的圖畫將貨品具現出來，更以簡短適當的文字加以解說。但廣吿畫的種類也很多？一般用的，我們可以看到平面的和立體的兩種。這兩種當然都各有優點，但在大體上我們可以說立體的較平面的更能使人發生具體的印象。德國某烟草公司出了一種香烟，他們對於這香烟起先作了一個平面的廣吿畫，那廣吿畫是將這種香烟的盒子打開，使內中的香烟露出半身來，這樣平面的表現在人的眼前；隨後他們又作了一個立體的圖畫，特別在一盒烟中抽出兩支來，將它在畫中立體的表現着。結果，據考察，後者給與人的印象是更深的。這種情形，如果我們能注意新聞紙上以及馬路旁邊的廣告畫，也能感到。</p>
<p>當然，廣告畫不僅有圖畫的表現，而且還有文字的說明。因此，在文字圖畫並有的廣吿中，便發生了排列的决序問題。究竟文字應該放在上面呢？還是圖畫應該放在上面呢？這當然不能死板的規定，而是要看情形說話的。不過，一般說來，因爲圖畫更能具現物品，更能引人注意，所以在一般塲合還是把圖畫放在上面，文字放在下面的好；如果除了主要的文字表現外，還要用幾句簡單的話來補充說明，以增加廣吿的效能，那這幾句補充的說明便當放在圖畫的旁邊，字當然也要比較的小，而那主要的表現不消說是當用較大的字，安置在廣吿下面或其他能收最大效果的地方。</p>
<p>無論是文字的或圖畫文字並有的廣吿，都當特別注意貨物需要者的對象。這里我可以舉出一個有趣的事實來：某酒店由內地運來了一種酒，有人先主張將這酒命名爲貴妃酒，意思是楊貴妃能號召羣衆；但有人反對這名稱，並主張名爲太白酒，理由是楊貴妃不及太白善飲，「太白斗酒詩百篇「是一般好酒者引以爲慰的；結果是採用了後者，並且作了一個醉意濃原的太白像來作廣吿。這便是注意到了廣吿宣傳的對象的。此外，對於老入，靑年，孩子，各種社會的人，在廣吿宣傳上也都應有區別，不能一概而論。拿一般人所愛吸的香烟來說，就中如下層乃至中層社會的入，不</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>僅只能吸十幾個銅板一盒的香烟，而且還想在這中間取點小利回來，所以近來有許多這一類的香烟都有點小獎（如火柴，肥皂之類），這是很對的；某此這類的香烟不採取這種辦法，在廣告宣傳中表明不願作這種濫費，據我看來，這是沒有認淸對象。反之，高貴的人所吸的高貴烟當然用不着採取吸烟有獎的辦法，因為高貴的人並不企圖那些小利，他們主要的是要貨色美好和高貴。</p>
<p>此外，在廣告的競賽中，要切實注意商塲的情形；要知道與已競爭者的優點和弱點；要穩重而又要不怕犧牲，這和賭錢一樣；……如此在商塲中進出，更輔以巧妙的廣告技術，那勝利的可能是很多的。</p>

<h3 id="c184">怎樣研究音樂？ <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 魯萍</p>
<p>據一般市俗的見解，音樂乃是一種消遣品，所以喜歡彈琴鼓瑟，吹簫弄笛者大都被認為是愛好玩耍的人。然而，誰都知道，悲哀的音樂會使人心傷欲淚。歡樂的歌曲會使人暢快發狂，激昂的調子也能令人興奮緊張：這些事實充分證明了音樂和別的藝術一樣，它具有組織人類的感情和思想的功能，在我們的生活中它人類生積極的作用。如宗敎的利用音樂來傳敎，軍隊的利用音樂來鼓勵將士，國家的利用音樂來敎育國民；更具體的，如馬賽曲在法國大革命中所起的偉大的作用，蘇聯的從各方面利用音樂來提高其人民的文化水平，基督敎徒的利用唱歌來集合羣衆，以宣傳「耶穌愛我，我愛耶穌」的敎義，這些都是實際的明證。因此，我們要研究音樂，首先就不當將它當作消遣品來玩弄，而是應該把它作為是服務於我們生活的藝術來研究的。</p>
<p>再說，普通以為研究音樂不外是學習音樂的技能，如怎樣彈鋼琴，怎樣奏梵啞鈴等是。但是，即使是鋼琴和梵啞鈴等彈奏得很好的，如果不懂音樂的理論的話，那也只能算是高强的技師，不得稱為音樂家。一個眞正的音樂家不僅具有某些音樂的技能，而且懂得音樂的理論，或者能作歌曲，樂譜。所以，我們研究音樂不是偏於技術的，主要地是研究它的理論怎樣研究音樂的問題，不能細碎地作技術的考究；學習音樂的技能是須要依據許多機械的法則長期練習的。</p>
<p>我們要理論地研究音樂，首先就當明白音樂是什麼，明白它和人類生活的關係。上面已經說過，音樂是一種藝術；它的特質是在以調和的聲音來組織人類的思想和感情。如果聲音是自然界和社會中的物質的一種現象，思想和感情又是人類生活的產物了，並不是虛渺神奇的東西。據歷史家，藝術家　考察，在原始時代，音樂還沒有獨立的形態，僅是人類在勞動過程中所發生的簡單的歌唱或一種組織勞動的諧和的呼聲，這在根本是還不能和勞動本身分開的。及至人類生活相當地脫離了原始狀態，比較複雜時，音樂才得隨之形成；而其開花時期更是在社會巳有了集團的劃分的希臘時代。就這個事實看來同，當可知道音樂的起源就是和人類的勞動生活分不開的，是隨人類生活的發展而發展的。所以，我們研究音樂的中心意立場，是當從人類生活的見地，社會的見地去研究它；要這樣，才能理解一切音樂現象。如中世紀封建貴族的音樂是和神，宗敎結合着的，它的形式是以荘嚴為特點；又如自文藝復興以來的古典主義，浪漫主義和自然主義等的音樂，其內容與形式的特點則是與文學上的這些流派相同的；但這些現象，如果不從中世紀的封建貴族和文藝復興以後的發展着的市民之生活去研究，那便沒有辦法理解了。</p>
<p>這兒我們還可舉出一個更實際的現代的例證來說時問題。即是依據常識的判斷，音樂是重調和與韻律；所謂騷音向來為一般音樂家所鄙棄的。但在二十世紀的新時代中，隨着文學上的未來主義的產生也出現了音樂的未來主義，前者在創作中破壞了一般的文法，後者在音樂中便完全地無視了調和與韻律，努力的探求着騷音。他們宣言道：「音樂藝術為欲以優柔的調和娛樂我們的聽覺，曾經探求了透明的純粹性與甜蜜性。但現在的音樂藝術，則探究着最雜亂的，最怪異的，而且最銳利的音之混合」。為什麼呢？因為他們覺得：「在我們生活之一切發現中，都伴隨着騷音，騷音有着一種把我們導向生活的力。反之，與生活無緣的，平常的音樂之音，一種互相分離的音——便成為較對於眼睛更熟悉的，對於耳朶的過於熟悉的面影了。不成腔調的不規則的騷音為我們秘藏着無限的驚異。我們確信着逕分騷音（一切），使之互相應答，會從目不能見的歡悅中使人生豐富的。」這樣的奇怪現象恐怕會要使你吃驚吧。但是，假使我們能社會地去考究未來主義音樂產生的時代和國土，那這奇怪現象便是不難明白的。事實上，這樣的未來主義的音樂是出現於二十世紀新時代的意大利的一個藝術上的流派。因為這時的意大利是年輕的資本主義的國家，在那里有機械的嘈雜聲，電車，汽車等的雜亂聲，都會的人羣的喧囂聲，所以未來主義的音樂家才有了「不規則的騷音」的對象；又因為年輕的資本主義意大利的知識份子生活條件是意外的壞，大市民又抱着進攻的雄圖，所以作為知識份子的集團的示來派音樂家便追隨在意大利的市民之後，受着錢口袋的支配，站在市民的立場上努力讚美機械，表現它的進攻雄圖。這樣，就是那樣的未來派的音樂，不是也為我們所明白了嗎？</p>
<p>其次，便當研究音樂本身的樂理。因為音樂雖是社會的產物，但並未因此就喪失了它的特性，獨立性；反之，要它有特性，獨立性即是要有它的存在意義，才可社會地理解牠，不然便無從捉摸了。所以，我們在知道社會地研究音樂後，還須依據音樂的特性去研究樂理，樂式，和聲學等。自然，就是樂理等的研究也是要社會地研究，因為就是音樂的特性也存在於其社會性中的；但是，為了不發生混亂，為了要顯明問題的特點，將音樂本身的樂理等的研究特別提出，仍是必要的。</p>
<p>所謂樂理，乃是樂譜上的知識，如符號，節奏，樂語，音程地，音階等等。所謂樂式即是音樂的歌曲的各種形式，如祭曲，交響曲，奏鳴曲等等。至於和聲學，則是研究音的組織及弦的使用法的。此外，還有各種樂器的構成，樂器本身的發達史等等，都須特別研究。這些研究，雖然有些近於技術理論，但要作一個音樂家，假使不懂音樂的節奏，形式，音的構成以及許多樂器的名目和構造，那是不行的。</p>
<p>同時，因為音樂是藝術的一個分野，一時代的藝術潮流與當時的音樂都有不可分離的關係，如上述的未來主義的文學和未來主義的音樂之特點和傾向完全相同，便是顯明的例證；所以，我們研究音樂不僅要考究這的特性和社會性，考究它的發達史，以明白藝術中的地位，以明白各時代所發生的音樂傾向之根源。不然，對於許多音樂現象便無法在一般藝術傾向中去求理解，結果使音樂的研究成為孤立，成為與研究藝術沒有關係，因而在研究中所得的知識也必然是不完善的。</p>
<p>然而，以上所說只是一般研究音樂應注意之點。在這下面，還有許多更特殊更專門的研究，那是必要有更特殊的知識和法則的。譬如研究提琴（即梵啞鈴）吧，那除具有上述的一般音樂的知識外，更當去研究提琴的起源和構造以及它在音樂中的地位，去研究為什麼在一雙木箱上裝上四條絲綫就成為這樣的樂器，為什麼提琴的發音是那麼圓潤柔和等等。他如學習鋼琴等也當一樣。</p>
<p>如此說來，研究音樂，要想成為一個音樂家不是很不容易嗎？的確，這是比一般藝術的研究都要難的；事實上，從古至今有幾個悲多芬呢？由此可見一個偉大的音樂家之產生的困難。不過，我們研究音樂不必一定就希望成為悲多芬，主要地是當學習一點音樂的知識和技能，以服務社會，以推廣音樂敎育。而且，如果要想有新的悲多芬產生，也非普及音樂敎育，提高一般音樂的知識水平不可。如現在的蘇聯，由於一般音樂敎育很普及，盡力使每一個國民都具有一些音樂知識和技能，所以在那里就出現了許多少壯的音樂天才。現在，我們要想有音樂天才出現，也當努力普及音樂敎育纔好。</p>

<h3 id="c185">談「常」 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— 陶望</p>
<p>世間沒有「常在」的事物的。</p>
<p>人們以為人的個體還能在活動的時節是為生，世人多以生為「常」，故其對向之死為「無常」。其實據着所謂細胞的新陳代謝說一檢點，就可知非僅去年之我非今年之我，且昨日之我亦非今日之我，不僅昨日之我非今日之我，就是前一秒鐘的我也非此一秒鐘的我。個體中的細胞隨時在前仆後繼，這裏面永遠發現不出一個「常」。所以人死了，其戚友或其他較有關係的人，常為了這一點「無常」的景緻所震悼，而其人時時刻刻的死滅，則不再有人為之留神了。</p>
<p>天下無不散的筵席，物時換兮星已移，百年內，昔日之滄海，今且耘為桑田。自然如斯，人事何能獨外？所以看了這些佛家所謂「無常」的事事物物，任憑你是最富於感情的詩人墨客，也當趕不及唏噓感嘆的了。</p>
<p>人類的感情終究是平易的時候多，人生多少不平凡的刺激都因為看慣了花花草草紅紅綠綠，而終至平靜的心湖不再揚起汹湧的大浪了。然而這是潛隱，不是消失，只要看深沈練達的人，每逢勝會，亦輒不免愄惘感慨，就可以知道了。曹孟德固一世之雄，然在積槊賦詩時，亦終不免悲從中來呢？</p>
<p>雖然，人世上混混噩噩且度今宵的人畢竟多。在Great　Hotel　一劇中、普天下的旅客熙往攘來，蠅營狗茍，悲歡離合，使大飯店有如大劇塲，而一幕幕悲劇或喜劇演過了，大飯店的門前固依然車如流水馬如龍，熱鬧如故，可是在這熱鬧如故的狀態中，正孕育着第二幕的悲劇或喜劇的排演，而緊接的演出，層出不窮。這偌大的大飯店中，人數無慮千百，對此無常的人世慨嘆不已者，僅一冷靜旁觀的神秘怪醫生而已。</p>
<p>因人世無常，故有「人間苦」，唯其人世不免種種痛苦，非物質所能治療，故有藝術與宗敎的產生，所以廚川白村說：文藝為苦悶的象徵。</p>
<p>一個國家的政治經濟也常在無常的過程中變幻着，事實至顯，我們無須遠徵唐虞，卽隨掇時事，亦不無好例子：營正常商業的商店，在無常的漩渦裏冰塊般的倒塌子，而唯有營獎券業類的公司商號，方有繼往開來的盛况，所以國人向視為銖錙較量的商業，其前途亦至為無常。</p>
<p>然而，照上所述，殊多語病的，因為政治經濟在歷史的過程上是有正當的軌道可循的，這些僅能視為「反常」現象罷了。</p>
<p>據說此時又是「非常時」了。非常時正是我們的貴鄰所整日高呼的。為了非常時的準備，不惜毀綱敗紀，那是如何的尖厲的呼聲啊！然而環視周側，猶如是脫軌的列車，從反常反常的深淵里墮下去！</p>
<p>「非常」，「反常」，均屬「無常」，因其相對待之「常」則一。</p>

<h3 id="c186">說書先生 <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 顧鄔</p>
<p>「說書」，本也是一種民間的藝術，不過因牠不十分投士大夫階級的所好，所以就被視為「雕虫小技」「無足稱道」的了；其實我們只要走進任何一處「書塲」去看看那些聽衆，便可知道牠的潛勢力却足夠使你說一聲「偉大」啊！</p>
<p>「說書」一道，最盛行的地方要算江浙兩省，而上海和蘇州兩地更為熱鬧。其次，如長江流域及北方一帶也極盛行，「書迷」當然也不少，可是比起江浙兩省來，似乎還有點遜色。說書在蘇州稱「彈詞」，上海和京，滬，杭，甬各地都稱「說書」，在北方一帶却叫「相聲」，至於長江流域一帶如贛，鄂，湘等省，則有的稱「說書」，有的稱「說古」。說書名稱旣因地而異，所以「說技」也就各有不同。</p>
<p>蘇州的「說書」多用「琵琶」幫腔，說書的人有時是「雙檔」，有時是「單檔」，說的書詞有照原本直說，也有自編的新詞。在說書的技巧方面，却全在各人天才的施展，揷科打　，運用得適宜，使聽衆如身歷其境，忘記了自身，等到「一回」書說完了，還自覺得「猶有餘味」，不想走開，像這種說書的人材，在蘇州的確是不在少數。在上海，如「東方書場」以及各茶園，雖有些說書的人材是各重一時，但都還是由蘇州來的，究竟算不得什麼稀奇。</p>
<p>北方的「相聲」和南方的彈詞略有不同，就是一個祇「說」和「做」而不「唱」，一個祇「說」和「彈唱」而不「做」。北方的「相聲」雖也如蘇州的說書一樣盛極一時，但人才却不及蘇州那樣的「輩出」；不過據蘇州說書界的前輩們說來，南方的說書一道，雖比從前更加普遍，但在人材方面也不免有「一代不如一代」的趨勢。因為從前學說書的人大都是在舊學方面下過苦功，所以說起書來，在詞句上頗能運用自如；而且有許多人起初並沒打算把「說書」當做職業，因此多數就「不尙師傅」，祇憑各人的天才從事演唱而已。不過，現在的情形可不同了。最近一班後起的說書人，有的連書本上還有許多的字都沒有弄清楚，也竟然不自量力的要「出道」了。這一方面是因為有些說書界前輩鑒於自已年事漸高，恐一生的心血不能「傳人」，便胡亂收一兩個徒弟承繼「衣鉢」；另一方面是因為有許多不得意的說書人雖然學得一肚子「本事」，可是命運不濟，一生都是那麼寂寂無聞的沒有人來欣賞他，於是才想造就一兩個出色的徒弟，好替自己「揚眉吐氣」，帮回一點面子；可是還有一種說書人，因自身生活不易解决，便也收一兩個徒弟，藉以收取一筆「蟄敬禮」。</p>
<p>學說書拜師，也像學京劇一樣，多數是從小就學起，「　　　　家」的雖　　有，但是　對的少數。我有一個朋友的孩子，曾經人介紹拜了一個說書的做「師父」，「蟄敬禮」是一百元，還備了一桌酒請「師父」；在席上就由介紹人替那朋友立了一張「投師字」，手續就是這麼完了。受業的期限是三年，期滿便由師父介紹「出道」或跟師父「搭檔」；不過也有學了三年而「本事」仍沒有「到家」的，那師父就可以不過問徒弟的出路了。另外還有一種說書人，收徒弟並不必要什麼「蟄敬禮」，而敎授徒弟也還是一樣，可是這種徒弟就沒有什麼自由，所謂「一日為師，終身如父」，拜師之後的一切行動，都得聽師父作主。花錢拜師的徒弟，那不過等於買「本事」，行動極其隨便，師父對他一點也不加拘束。每天「學藝」，先由師父規定一個時間，而且大多數都在下午，因為說書的人都有一種以畫作夜的習慣，每天不到下午三時是不肯起牀的。學時，先是由徒弟抄好一部「藍本」，把上面的詞句像在學堂裏唸書那麼地唸熟，然後才由師父一句一句像敎京劇似的有板有眼地敎起來。說書的人大多數都有許多嗜好，除喜睏晏覺外，吃鴉片也是不可少的，所以敎徒弟學說書大都就在鴉片舖前，吃一口鴉片敎幾句；等到敎完了十幾句書，差不多已經費了一兩點鐘的時間了。這種遲鈍而又漫不經心的敎授法，往往一個徒弟跟他學了三年，肚子裏却還沒有裝到三部書進去；現在有許多不高明的說書人材，便都是這麼造就出來的。</p>
<p>說書剛「出道」時多半是跟着師父「搭檔」，猶如京劇裏的「掃邊老生」一樣，祇唱些不繁劇的書詞，無非是趁機會練習練習而已。也有剛「出道」就獨當一面「開場」，不藉師父的聲望的，不過有這種魄力的徒弟例底還是少數。</p>
<p>一個剛「出道」的說書的人，如果有一次能在某一個「書塲」裏「叫了座」，那他在三五年內，是不愁沒地方聘請的。一個「走紅」的說書人，他每個月的收入最少也有一二百元，有時兼任三數處「書塲」的說書，那就更不止此數。他們的收入來源，有的是凈拿月薪，有的是做「拆賑」。拿薪水的標準，那是要看說書人的聲望怎樣而定，最高薪水約有六十元到八十元，其餘如四十元上下的却很普遍；做「拆賑」的都是對拆，照門券的收入計算，據說有時比拿薪水的收入還要豐富一點，不過有時是沒有把握的。像上海的東方，吳園等「書塲」，差不多都是做「拆賑」；據場子裏人說，生意好時，一個說書的竟能到手二三百元。上海近年來說書的人材比較發達，大半也就是因為賺錢比在蘇州還要容易的緣故。在蘇州聽一次書，最多不過花一二百錢，　連茶錢也包括在內，茶園除掉茶錢，其餘便交給說書的，一個說書的一天能收入多少，由此便可以想見的了。所以蘇州的一些說書的名家，近年來差不多都朝這鋪滿了黃金似的上海奔來。</p>
<p>再說到長江一帶的說書人的生活，那更是比蘇州說書人淸苦得可憐。我在九江住過一些時，看到那裏說書人淸苦得可憐。我在九江住過一些時，看到那裏說書的就在江邊找一塊空塲子，橫七竪八地擺了十幾條長板櫈，一條櫈子大約可坐十多個人，塲的中間放着一張測字攤似的竹架，上面有一把茶壺和一聲「戒方」，另外還有一個蹦　，這便是一個「書塲」的佈置。聽書的人都是靠山吃飯的搬運工人，搬完了貨便來聽一回書。這個說書的是一個長條子，臉上的氣色差不多像鴉片一樣的黝黑，一顚一跛地走到那張竹架支起來的桌子旁，吃了兩口茶，拿一根細竹桿望着那面蹦鼓叮隆地敲了一陣，便對一些聽衆說了一點「引子」，然後又吃了幾口茶，這才「言歸正傳」的把以前沒有說完的書接續說下去。聽衆都一個個地低着頭凝神靜聽，塲子裏真是「鴉雀無聲」。說了還不到半個鐘頭，祇聽得戒木突的響了一聲，說書的便停住不說了，手裏拿一雙篾籮走下塲來，笑嘻嘻地向每個聽衆說了聲叨光，祗見許多人都向口袋裏摸索了一陣，一時就祇聽見銅板叮叮噹噹的響聲。一會兒把錢收了，又重行說起來，過不了半個鐘點，又「如法泡製」了一次。我在那裏聽到他說到一處緊張的地方便戛地停住了，一共是說了四個鐘頭，看看那張竹架桌子上的銅板，還不到二百枚，要是合算起當地的大洋來，却祇有五角多錢呢。</p>

<h3 id="c187">十八世紀的生物學 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 約行</p>
<p>遠在十七世紀，昆虫學的生物學，就可說是頗精密的了；但在生命的科學中，並未因此發生很大的變動。及至十八世紀時，才有人進行生物的分類，在生物學上才有進化觀點出現，近代的生物學在大體上才可說是形成。所以，我們要研究近代的生物學乃至一般自然科學，便非知道十八世紀的生物學不可。</p>
<p>首先進行生物的分類的，當推林勒（Linneus一七〇七—一七七八）。他的最大的功績卽在將當時已有的許多材料加以整理，給與統一的命名；現行的動植物學的命名法便是由他確立的。他主張對於生物的種類以二語來命名：卽以第一語來表示其所屬（Genus），以第二語來表示其種族（Species）。一七四九年他開始採用了這樣的命名法；在一七五三年的Species　plantarum及一七五八年的「博物大系」第十版中，他更一般地實用了他的主張。</p>
<p>林勒的分類是帶着人工性質的。如克爾勒（Kerner）所說，林勒並不以為他的植物界中二十四族的分類是其自然的分類；他以為植物學研究之最高目的，是基於由構造的特性所顯示的植物之種類而完成自然體系。但他除僅僅遺下了一些斷片之外，並未將這所謂自然體系完成。</p>
<p>他的研究的第二特點是在於種的意想之强調。本來勒伊（Ray一六二八—一七〇五）在博物學中曾首先導入了種的槪念，而且考究了它的變化。林勒的研究便是在勒伊的研究上構成的，但他在初期的著作中認為種是一定不變的。他以為當地球構成時各種動物就被創生了，現在的種便是原來的種的未變的直接的後裔。他的這個種的固定不變的立塲卽是反進化的立塲，直到他那「博物大系」續版時才略有幾分改變。</p>
<p>這樣的生物不變說，是與宗敎的神話相結合着的。從古代到文藝復興乃至十八世紀以前，一般學者差不多都是站在這樣的神學的立塲，以為現在生存着的一切生物都是過去生物的純然的後裔，不是由進化而來的。自然，就在古代也有進化的觀點，但那是沒有實際基礎的；進化論的理論之確立不能不說是在十八世紀乃至十九世紀的事。我們知道，近代意義上的進化理論首先當推拉馬克（Lamarck一七四四—一八二九）的變異說，用進廢退說，但拉馬克乃是活動於十八九世紀的人物；他的先驅者，我們可以舉出愛拉斯姆士，達爾文（Erasmus　Darwin一七三一—一八〇二）和詩人歌德（Goethe一七四七—一八三二）來，但這兩人也是生活於十八世紀到十九世紀之初的人物。因此，我們說進化思想之發端是在十八世紀：這是我們在談十八世紀的生物學時非特別注意不可的。</p>
<p>進化思想的萌芽首先可在與林勒同時代的布封（Buffon）的著作中見到。他從研究許多動物中，得到了生物會因氣象的，地理的種種原因而變化的暗示，他由其體制上比較各種生物的結果，知道了有一種共通於各生物全體的普通規劃存在，人類當然也不能例外。這便是說自然環境能影響生物的組織變化；現</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>今的　　　　　　的生命　　　　化而　，不是從古就是這樣的形態。</p>
<p>其次是偉大的詩人歌德在一七九〇年時，於他的」植物的變態」中提不了進化的思想。他在研究生物的器官時特別將各生物的諸器官加以比較的考究，這樣，他便得出了各生物器官之因環境的影響而逐漸變眞的結論；最後他暗示出了一切稦之起源都是合於進化論的理論的。</p>
<p>但在這個時代中，集進化論之大成的可以說是加爾茲，達爾文的祖父愛拉斯姆士，達爾文。他在一七九四年著作了“Zoonoma”說明了生物在起初並不是和今日的完全一樣，今日生物的形狀乃是逐漸進化的結果。他以爲生物是隨環境變化的；各種生物都　密切的血緣關係，在人類的腕和鳥類的羽翼之間表示出的類似，便顯示出了各生物間的這個血緣關係，顯示出了各生物是同一祖先的。</p>
<p>最後　應該說的，是與十八世紀的生物學有密切關係的，當時的生理學的發展。</p>
<p>生理學可說是由解剖學發展而來。解剖學能顯示動物和植物的複雜構造，但是，在我們了解這些複雜的　造時，必會發生這樣的疑問：這些器官及組織是爲什麼的呢？在實際上它們有什麼作用呢？回答這個疑問的便是生理學。所以生理學可說是補足解剖學的。</p>
<p>本來動物及植物的生理學從亞里士多德時候起就被研究的，但是，生理學之離解剖學而成爲一獨立學科的，乃是十八世紀的事情。這里値得注意的人物，是哈拉（Haller　一七〇八—一七七七）。他基於自己的觀察，實騐，組織了龐大的生理學體系，在所謂刺戟性中發見了生命的根本現象；他實騐的結果更發見了刺戟性是在筋肉中，感覺性是在神經要素中。這樣，他便被認爲是認識生命之自律性的先驅者了。</p>
<p>以上所說是十八世紀生物學之大概。當然近代生物學的眞正完成和發展，嚴格說來是在拉馬克出世以後的十九世紀，但是，如上所說的十八世紀的生物分類學，進化思想以及生理學等之成長，在近代生物學乃至自然科學的發展過程中是站着極重要的位置的。</p>

<h3 id="c188">說話不扯謊 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 光晨</p>
<p>所謂說老實話，就是說我們說話不扯謊，完全能够照事實說事實，絕對忠實地照事實表現出來，而不加一點杜撰和僞造。像這樣的說話似乎是社會一般的認爲最好而合於道德的，並且也是人人都容易辦到的。其實不然，如果你從哲學的觀點來考察這一問題，說老實話是很不容易的一件事，卽從社會科學的觀點來考察這一問題，也不是說老實話盡是合於道德律的。</p>
<p>理由非常顯明，如果說只就主觀的觀點立論，所謂說老實話就是把自己心裏所見所想的東西照實說出來，這就算是說老實話了，也算容易辦到的事。然而若從客觀的觀點來看，所謂老實話必須要能表現現實的眞情實况，能說明現實的客觀事物之本眞，吾則不能算是老實話。照這樣的老實話來講，在哲學的領域內說去，自來只有唯物論的哲學是相當的講過老實話的，而能完全講眞正的老實話的，則又只有近代的新唯物論。至於一切主觀的，客觀的乃至二元論的觀念論哲學，都不是在講老實話。因爲在現實的眞正宇宙觀上，卽能表明眞實的宇宙本眞和共發展過程的宇宙觀上，物原是有自存的現實體的，人類和他的思維是以客觀的物質爲基礎，思維是由感覺的道路經過經騐的方法，才反映客觀的現實事物而產生的。因爲思維是現實世界的物質之發展，運動及其作用所暈禮形成的，存在於思辦中的原環　法則甚至事物的概念，如果它們都是正確的能够解釋現實的東西，那麼它們必然是現實的客觀之反映和轉換與移置，而不是主觀上自己虛構的幻想。可是能作這樣的觀察和說明的，只有唯物論的哲學，在觀念論者看來，它就恰恰和這相反。在他們講起來，原來自存於客觀世界的物，他們偏認這只存在於主很的心理上或感覺上，沒有我的心就沒有物，外物是不存在的。原來是物爲心之母，存在產生思維，他們却說心爲物之母，思維產生存在，或者說心與物無關而獨立存在，物心是兩個獨立的世界因棄，心並不產生於物。思維本來是要經過鳳覺通逃於外界，由經騐的方法去獲得，他們偏要說思維是自足的先天觀念之復活，或至多只是主觀感覺灣內之感覺要素的綜合，並不是外界的反映，一切原理，法則和事物概念都是在內心中　行生長起來的。如此看來，觀念論的哲學所講的話已經是不能表現世界的眞實情形，不能表明宇宙之發展那積自然經過社會再最後產生思維的眞實過程了。把物存在說成物不存在；把物可知說成物不可知：把思維產生於存在說成在在奮生於思維，或思雜獨自存在：把從客觀世界獲得的原理，法則，觀念說成是心理的自我創造的東西，這都不是說的老實話，而是一種幻想，是揑造的謊語。</p>
<p>至於玄學的唯物論者，他們雖然在根本前提上也承認物自身之與實存在的客觀性，承認思維產生於存在，這算是能表明世界本眞的一種老實的哲學講話，並沒有說謊。但他們的老實話也是不大完全的，因爲他們只能老老實實地說明靜態的個別的現實事物，却不能把字宙之辯證的發展的歷史過程那種眞實狀况說出來。在新的唯物輪則不然，它不但承認物自體是存在的，是可知的：承認思維產生於存在，主觀從屬於客觀：一切原理，法則和概念都是要經過感覺和經騐才能獲得，成爲外界的反映和轉換；而且現實世界是辯證的發展的，它卽以辯證的思維方法去認識和說明它。因爲如此，所以如果說說老實話是在能眞實地說明現實的眞像，不揑造也不增不减地恰恰如現實世界之原樣去加以說明的話，那麼觀念論的哲學講話就不是說的老實話，依它的思想和方法也不能說出老實話來。玄學的堆物論哲學只是說了一部分老實話，依它的思想和方法也說不出完全的老實話來。只有新唯物論，它的本身是說得最完全的老實話，也只有依它的觀點和方法才可以說出完全美滿的老實話來。</p>
<p>自然，我們也不能說人類自來就不曾說過一點老實話的，同時也不能幻想一個任意的時代就能說出永遠完美的老實話。因爲說老實話也要受時空的限制，並不能由於我們主觀上想說任何樣的究全老實的話，就可以說得出來。在歷史的過程中，人類要能說些眞可以表明客觀世界的本眞的老實話，首先就是和人類之正確的科學知識的發展相關聯的。原始的和半開化的人類，他們對於自然和社會都認識不淸楚，所以對萬物都說它們是神造的，或說日，月，風，雲，雨等的本身就是神；人類的社會生活的幸與不幸都是冥冥中的命運所决定的。像這樣的說法就是些神話，是說謊，不是說的老實話。然而到了近代科學發達了，人們對於日，月，是，辰巳不再說它們是神物，而說它們是自然物；有些人已能在他的生活過程中，分析出他們所受的痛苦是由於經濟的社會關係，而不再說它是命運所决定的。像這樣的說法就比較能表朋眞實的事態之實情些</p>

<p>Yesterday Delivered to the Soviet Embassy, Pointing Out Factual Errors</p>
<p>Solemnly Declaring That We Still Maintain the Attitude of the First Note</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Following the establishment of the Soviet-Mongolian protocol and our lodging of a second protest with the Soviet Embassy on the 11th, we refuted point by point the Soviet confirmation that the Sino-Russian Agreement remained valid, and declared that we still maintained the attitude expressed in the first protest note. The Foreign Ministry also notified Wu Nanru, Counselor of our Embassy in the Soviet Union, of this matter on the 11th via telegram. Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, did not wish to express personal opinions on the matter and did not mention it to visitors. On the 11th, the Soviet Embassy had telegraphed our second protest to its government. It is expected that the Soviet government will issue a further reply within a day or two. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On March 12, the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia signed a military mutual assistance protocol. On April 7, our country lodged a first protest, declaring that it could not be recognized and was not bound by it. The Soviet side replied on [date], using evasive language regarding territorial sovereignty, but stated regarding the Russo-Chinese Agreement that no protest was made by China at the time of its signing thirteen years ago, which is factually inaccurate. After receiving this reply, our Foreign Ministry immediately drafted a second protest and delivered it to the Soviet Embassy in China on the 11th. In addition to acknowledging receipt of the Soviet confirmation that the Sino-Russian Agreement remained valid, it further refuted it and pointed out its factual errors, and solemnly declared that our side still maintained the attitude expressed in the first note. The full text of these exchanges (three in total) is disclosed below:</p>
<h3 id="e2">China's First Protest Note <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of the note: Earlier this month, your Excellency the Ambassador personally delivered a copy of a document claiming to be a protocol signed between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia. Article 5 of the "Outline Agreement for the Settlement of Outstanding Issues between China and Russia," signed on May 31, 1924, stipulates that "the Soviet Government recognizes Outer Mongolia as an integral part of the Republic of China and respects China's sovereignty within that territory." Outer Mongolia is a part of the Republic of China, and no country can conclude any treaty or agreement with it. Now, the Soviet Government, disregarding its statement to the Chinese Government, has unilaterally signed the aforementioned protocol with Outer Mongolia. This act infringes upon China's sovereignty and violates the provisions of the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement. There is no doubt about this. This Minister hereby lodges a serious protest with your Excellency the Ambassador and declares that the protocol signed between the Soviet Government and Outer Mongolia is illegal, and the Chinese Government will not recognize it and is not bound by it. I request your Excellency the Ambassador to take note and convey this to your government for a satisfactory reply. This note is hereby issued.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Soviet Side's Reply Note <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month, your Chargé d'affaires, acting on instructions from your government, delivered a copy of a note to this Commissioner, which your side also personally delivered to the Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, on the same day. The reason given in the note is that the Soviet government signed a protocol with the "Mongolian People's Republic" on March 12 of this year, which is considered an infringement of Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the Sino-Soviet Agreement of May 31, 1924. Therefore, the Nanjing government believes it can lodge a protest. The reply to this note is as follows: The Soviet government cannot agree with the interpretation of the Soviet-Mongolian protocol contained in the note, and it cannot consider the protest made by the Chinese government to be justified. The signing of the protocol, and all the articles within it, do not in any way harm Chinese sovereignty. The protocol does not allow for, nor does it include, any territorial claims by the Soviet Republic against China or the "Mongolian People's Republic." The signing of the protocol does not alter the formal or actual relations that currently exist between China and the Soviet Republic, and between the Soviet Republic and the "Mongolian People's Republic." The Soviet Union, in signing the mutual assistance protocol, believes that the Sino-Soviet Agreement signed in Beijing in 1924 is not impaired and remains fully effective. The Soviet government hereby reaffirms the aforementioned agreement and, as far as the Soviet side is concerned, it remains in effect, and in the future, as for the question of whether we are formally entitled to sign agreements with autonomous parts of the Republic of China, it is only necessary to mention that the Soviet government signed an agreement with the government of the Three Eastern Provinces in Fengtian on August 20, 1924. This matter did not elicit any protest from the government of the Republic of China and was recognized by it. The Fengtian-Russian Agreement has the same effect as the Beijing Agreement. At the same time, it should be noted that the Soviet-Mongolian protocol does not oppose the interests of third countries, as it only takes effect when the Soviet Union or the "Mongolian People's Republic" becomes the victim of an aggressor and has to defend its own territory. Based on the above reasons, the Soviet government believes that it has no choice but to reject the protest of the Chinese government, considering it to be unfounded. At the same time, it expresses its deep conviction that the government of the Republic of China will surely be convinced that the Soviet-Mongolian protocol does not violate the Beijing Agreement and is in accordance with the interests of the Chinese and Mongolian people. I request that your Chargé d'affaires accept the most sincere respects of this Commissioner. Chargé d'affaires of the Republic of China (signed) Litvinov.</p>
<h3 id="e4">China's Second Protest Note <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of the note: Regarding the matter of the Soviet Republic signing a mutual assistance protocol with Outer Mongolia, this Minister delivered a protest note to your Excellency the Ambassador on April 7, declaring that the signing of the protocol infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and violates the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement, which the Chinese government cannot recognize. On the 9th of this month, your Excellency the Ambassador delivered a copy of a note from the Soviet Foreign Minister to the Chargé d'affaires of the Republic of China in the Soviet Union, replying to the above-mentioned note from this Minister. The note stated that "The Soviet government hereby reaffirms the aforementioned agreement (the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement) and, as far as the Soviet side is concerned, it remains in effect, and in the future..." The Soviet government hereby reaffirms that Outer Mongolia is an integral part of the Republic of China and respects China's rights within that territory. This Minister has taken note of this assurance from the Soviet government. However, after reviewing the Soviet government's explanation of the matter of the Soviet Union signing the protocol with Outer Mongolia, this Minister believes that there is no sufficient reason. The Fengtian-Russian Agreement concluded in Fengtian in 1924, which was cited, cannot be taken as a precedent. The note stated that the signing of the Fengtian-Russian Agreement did not elicit any protest from the government of the Republic of China, which is contrary to the facts. After the local authorities there had submitted the agreement to the central government for approval, and before it became an annex to the Sino-Soviet Agreement, the former Beijing Foreign Ministry repeatedly protested to your country's ambassador to China on August 25 and September 11 of 1924, and the Chinese diplomatic representative in Moscow also protested to the Soviet government. Subsequently, the agreement was approved by the central government, completed legal procedures, and was only then notified to the Soviet government in March of 1925 as an annex to the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement. This incident was originally an illegal act by your side that violated international norms and was corrected by the Chinese government. Therefore, it cannot be cited as a precedent for your side's right to sign any agreement with local governments in China. The aforementioned protocol signed between the Soviet government and Outer Mongolia infringes upon the sovereignty of the Republic of China and fundamentally contradicts the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement. The Chinese government has no choice but to reiterate its protest against the protocol and maintain the attitude expressed in the above-mentioned note. I request your Excellency the Ambassador to take note and convey this to your government. This note is hereby issued. To: Bogomolov, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to China. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Reports state that British troops forcibly occupied Jingmao, in the second district of Lancang County, and established a wireless telegraph and other military facilities. After the local authorities sent a letter of inquiry, the British side only sent a copy of a joint committee notice. The Lancang side believes that the notice was fabricated by the British side and has sent a telegram calling for action. The Foreign Ministry considered this news to be bizarre and telegraphed our boundary survey commissioners to investigate thoroughly. A reply has now been received, stating that the reported events are a misunderstanding. At the time, another British survey team was surveying north from Bangsang, with the permission of the committee, and our side had telegraphed Yang, the Director of Pu'er, to instruct Lancang to provide protection. When the British survey team first arrived, there were slight misunderstandings in Menglian, Ximeng, and other places, but after explanations, everything was fine. Outsiders were unaware of this, leading to this misreporting. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Measures for Anti-Smuggling in North China <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The Customs Administration and the Inspector General of Customs Have Agreed; To Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Approval and Implementation After Discussion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of anti-smuggling in North China, it is now learned that the Customs Administration and the Inspector General of Customs have agreed on measures. After the Ministry of Finance convenes a meeting of relevant departments for discussion, they can be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. It is reported that the nature of these anti-smuggling measures will be applicable to other areas with rampant smuggling. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Groups of Japanese ruffians are building warehouses in Changli, Beidaihe, Nandasi, and Liushouying as temporary storage places for smuggled goods unloaded from the shore. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 11th, a train carrying smuggled goods arrived in Tianjin from Nandasi and Changli and was unloaded at the East Station and transported into a certain concession. The smuggled goods included 3,000 bags of sugar and 400 pieces of rayon cloth. The customs estimates that from the 4th to the 11th, over 4,300 tons of smuggled sugar and over 8,000 tons of rayon cloth were transported to Tianjin within a week. On the 11th, Du, the Deputy Commissioner of Customs in Tianjin, visited Chen Juesheng, the Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and requested that the East and General Stations assist in anti-smuggling and prevent smuggling. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because the customs is unable to seriously combat smuggling, Japanese ruffians are taking advantage of the reward system for providing information on smuggling to report to the customs. Even if the customs does not seize smuggled goods, they are demanding rewards, making it impossible for the customs to cope. Recently, a notice was issued stating that for reports of smuggled goods accepted and seized by the customs, one-quarter of the proceeds from the sale of the smuggled goods will be awarded to the informant. If the report is accepted but the smuggled goods are not seized, no reward will be given. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures for Exporting Surplus Salt to Japan <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Merchants Must First Apply for Review: Circular Telegrams Sent to the Four Regional Transport Commissioners</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of exporting surplus salt from various regions to Japan for industrial use, the Ministry of Finance is currently reviewing it and has established four measures to suit the current actual situation:</p>
<p>1. If there is surplus salt in various regions, it may be exported to Japan for industrial use, but only after certification by the Japan Monopoly Bureau.</p>
<p>2. Merchants requesting to export must first submit a request to the local salt affairs authority, which will conduct a thorough review to ensure that they are purely Chinese merchants with genuine capital and shares. The request will then be submitted to the Ministry for review and approval, and the merchant will be officially designated as an exporter. Those who directly submit requests to the Ministry will be instructed to submit them to the relevant regional authority for review and reporting before final approval. The number of exporters will be limited to three or more in each region, on a trial basis for one year.</p>
<p>3. The tax rate for industrial salt exported to Japan from each region will be temporarily set at one yuan per metric ton, and a cash deposit or a reliable bank guarantee will also be collected according to the highest tax rate in each region.</p>
<p>4. When salt is exported, all procedures, including inspection and verification, shall still be handled in accordance with the measures for exporting Chinese salt. The above measures were telegraphed by the Ministry of Finance to the Transport Commissioners of Changlu, Shandong, Lianghuai, and Fujian early on the morning of the 11th. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ministry of Finance believes that the issue of exporting Changlu salt is too serious and has ordered the Changlu Transport Office to handle it directly. The Changlu Salt Export Bureau and the Beach Industry Management Bureau will be abolished, and the regulations will be repealed. The Transport Office will formulate new measures for exporting salt, which will be changed. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Changlu Salt Export Bureau and the Changlu Beach Industry Management Bureau began closing down on the 11th. Director Liang Zhaoyuan went to Beiping to report to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The bureau was established two weeks ago, and the operating expenses totaled 3,000 yuan, which has been allocated by the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Recently, Qingdao has been producing a lot of salt, and the Japanese are actively buying it there. They are no longer actively buying and transporting Changlu salt. Therefore, the export of Changlu salt to Japan has been effectively postponed. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">A Perspective on the Attitudes of Britain and France Towards Italy <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>When the League of Nations, based on Article 16 of the Covenant, passed the economic sanctions plan against Italy, people around the world did not believe that it could achieve the practical effect of sanctions. However, they also did not expect that the result would be the same as the Manchurian Incident. Now we know what the so-called peace, justice, and humanity in the mouths of imperialists really mean.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, can the major powers that control the League of Nations, such as Britain and France, truly stand up for justice, impose economic sanctions, and follow up with military sanctions? Even if the Locarno Treaty had not been declared abolished, even if the German armed forces had not entered the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland, these major powers would not be willing to fulfill this task for their despised colored races. Moreover, at this time of European turmoil?</p>
<p>The attitude of the British Conservative government was extremely ambiguous at the beginning of the Italo-Ethiopian War. The reason why the Conservative Party changed its past attitude at the end of last year and tried its best to impose sanctions on Italy was actually because the election period was approaching, and British public opinion was unanimously opposed to the war of aggression. In order to cater to public opinion and win the election, the Conservative Party had no choice but to advocate sanctions against Italy. Therefore, this move by the Conservative Party was not out of love for peace, nor out of love for Abyssinia. With the victory in the election, the Conservative Party's goal has been achieved, and the Conservative Party's betrayal of the League of Nations and the betrayal of Ethiopia also began. Foreign Secretary Hoare actually jointly drafted a peace plan with French Prime Minister Laval, recognizing Italy's occupation of Ethiopian land acquired in the war of aggression, and demarcating a large part of Ethiopian land for Italian immigrants and economic development. The face of the angel of peace suddenly changed into a ferocious one, which is why it aroused dissatisfaction among the people of the country and had no choice but to resign. Although the Conservative Party has suffered this setback, its fundamental policy has not changed. If Italy's attitude is not too excessive, its desires are not too extravagant, and military actions in East Africa can be kept within limits and not encroach on the British sphere of influence in the Lake Tana basin, it can be expected that the British Conservative Party will choose an appropriate time to generously give away other people's property in order to achieve so-called peace.</p>
<p>If the attitude of Britain is like this, what about France?</p>
<p>Before we discuss French policy, we must first know the difference between the left and right wings of France on Italian policy. When the British advocated sanctions, the French right-wing newspapers believed that this move would be enough to destroy the Stresa Front, drive France and Italy into opposition, and allow the German National Socialists to have the leeway to intervene in Austria-Hungary and Memel. The left-wing newspapers held a different view, saying that France must unite with Britain to ensure the safety of the Rhine River and maintain the spirit of Locarno. Although the opinions of the two factions differed greatly, they agreed on preventing the resurgence of Germany and maintaining France's security on the continent. The Laval cabinet was like this, and the Sarraut cabinet was also like this. Therefore, from former Foreign Minister Laval to the current Foreign Minister Flandin, their foreign policy is willing to maintain their coordinated relationship with Britain since the European War, and they are also willing to maintain the Stresa Front and the Franco-Italian intimacy that arose after the Rome Agreement.</p>
<p>Until recently, the mutual relationship between Britain, France, and Italy has undergone rapid changes. German troops are stationed in the demilitarized zone, and France's attitude towards Italy has undergone a sudden change. Italian troops have occupied the city of Gondar in Ethiopia, and the vanguard is approaching the Lake Tana basin, and Britain's attitude has undergone a sudden change. The enemy of France on the European continent is Germany, not Italy, while the enemy of Britain in the Mediterranean and Africa is Italy, not Germany. Different interests lead to different orientations. In order to prevent German revenge, France is extremely willing to maintain the Locarno tradition. Britain guarantees its security, but the British Conservative Party has never made a clear indication. France will inevitably have to turn to another great power, both Latin and a powerful support, for support. How can France please Italy? This has become the primary consideration for French politicians at present. Under this situation, France does not dare to openly offend Italy, which is to be expected. Italy will also take advantage of this opportunity, which is also natural. Italy's use of Austria to assert itself and its alliance with Germany to strengthen its voice are all meant to show the French that if they intensify sanctions, Italy will go elsewhere and become an enemy of France. In order to win over Italy, how could France not go against the British and propose a suspension of sanctions to show favor to Italy? France and Italy are colluding with each other, which will inevitably cause displeasure to the British. What Britain values is the source of the Blue Nile. Now that the Italian army has reached the Lake Tana area, if Lake Tana is controlled by Italy, the water conservancy of the cotton-growing area in the Sudanese part of Egypt will be disrupted. We have seen news that the Italian authorities have expressed respect for Egyptian interests, but the Italian respect for British interests in the Lake Tana basin has not yet been heard. The progress of the Italian army and the ambition of the Italians are all in conflict with British interests. The anxiety of the British can be imagined. British Foreign Secretary Eden pointed out the cruelty of the Italians and the efforts of the Thriteen-Nation Committee to [missing words].</p>
<p>If there are no special developments in the overall European situation in the future, it can be predicted that Ethiopia will be placed on the altar of the League of Nations and divided by the major powers. What is unknowable is to what extent Italy will be able to satisfy its territorial desires and to what extent Britain will retreat and be willing to give up.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Draft Articles and Schedules of the National Assembly's Two Laws <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The Central Standing Committee's Principles and Key Points for Amending the Two Laws: Media Representatives May Account for Ten Seats</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The principles for the organization law and the representative election law of the National Assembly, amended by the Central Standing Committee, were submitted to the Legislative Yuan on the 11th. The special 24-member committee of the Legislative Yuan decided to hold its first meeting next week to review the draft articles and schedules of the two laws drafted by the five members including Lin Bin, in accordance with the original and amended principles set by the Central Government. After thorough investigation, the key points of the amendment principles are as follows: The number of National Assembly representatives will remain at 1,200, including 687 regional representatives, 322 professional group representatives, 58 free professional group representatives, 40 overseas Chinese representatives, 40 Mongolian and Tibetan representatives, 23 Northeast representatives, and 30 military representatives. However, Dai Chuanxian and Yu Youren have expressed opinions on the allocation of free professional group representatives and the quota allocation of a certain province for regional representatives. These have also been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review and appropriate adjustments within the stipulated numbers for each category. Since there is no clear distinction between professional groups and industrial groups, the term "industrial groups" has been deleted from the original principles. The candidates recommended by each electoral district originally had to be reduced by one-fifth after review by the provincial government, but this has now been changed to allow the provincial government to submit opinions, and the Central Government will designate three times the number of representatives to be elected from each district. It is reported that the so-called professional groups refer to chambers of commerce, trade unions, and business associations, while free professional groups refer to associations of lawyers, journalists, accountants, engineers, and medical practitioners. The national media community can occupy about ten seats within the quota of 58 free professional group representatives, and Dai Chuanxian has advocated for an appropriate increase. In addition, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Industry have separately submitted population statistics tables for various provincial districts, as well as the number of people in various professional groups and their business conditions, to the Legislative Yuan for reference.

<p>(Nanjing) After the implementation of the monetary policy last year, the Ministry of Finance drafted nine fundamental banking regulations, divided into exchange, industrial, trust, savings, real estate mortgage, farmer, provincial bank, and county and city bank regulations. The Legal Affairs Committee recently completed all drafts and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. After legislative procedures, the Ministry of Finance plans to reorganize the Exchange Bank and the Industrial Bank into the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, respectively. However, since the banknotes issued by these two banks and the banknotes of the Central Bank are both designated as currency, the two banks will first gradually improve their business operations in the short term, and there will be no nominal changes. The Real Estate Mortgage Bank is currently being prepared by the Construction Bank Corporation. There are still several points regarding mortgage methods that are being requested from the Ministry of Finance, so the date of establishment has not yet been determined. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e21">The Ministry of Finance Requests an Order to Transfer the Management Rights of Hunan Paste Salt <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance submitted to the Executive Yuan that many paste salt companies have been established in Xiangtan, Hunan, which produces paste salt. The Hunan Department of Finance only ordered the Xiangtan Business Production and Sales Tax Bureau to collect taxes on a per-pot basis and issue licenses, allowing them to sell in Xiangtan County, but never went through the supervision and inspection procedures of the local salt affairs agencies, which is contrary to the unified system of the salt law. It is urgent to take over management to comply with the new salt law. However, according to the Hunan Provincial Government, the Xiangtan Paste Salt Mining Industry Association stated that the Hunan paste salt industry is in its early stages, with heavy profits and low margins, and requested a postponement of the takeover and tax increase to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants. The Ministry of Finance reviewed that although Hunan paste salt has gradually developed (a paste salt company has also been established in Liuyang County), the commercial strength is still weak, which is also true. It seems that the Management Bureau should take over, and the salt tax to be levied should still be collected at the original business production and sales tax rate levied by the Hunan Provincial Government, without increasing it. Furthermore, the average income of the Hunan Provincial Government from the business production and sales tax levied on these merchants in the past three years should be determined as the annual amount of the central government's non-resident expenses, which will be allocated to the Hunan Provincial Government by the national treasury on a monthly or quarterly basis, so as to eliminate the merchants' concerns about increased burdens, and the provincial government will not have to change the budget. Moreover, since Hunan paste salt is still in its early stages, the management affairs should not be too complicated, and the Xiang'an salt affairs agencies should handle it concurrently, without setting up a special bureau to save expenses.

<p>(Beiping) Imai returned to Beiping from Tianjin yesterday. According to his talk, he has met with Yan and other important people in Shanxi and inquired about the bandit suppression situation in Shanxi. The military affairs of bandit suppression in Shanxi are going smoothly. Except for the remnants in the Xingxian and Linxian areas of northern Shanxi, most of the bandits are scattered in the four rural areas near the Fencheng-Datong-Puzhou Railway line in southern Shanxi. In total, there are no more than 10,000 bandits in southwestern Shanxi. The authorities have ample capacity to prevent and suppress them. However, it will still take time to completely eliminate them. The morale in Taiyuan is stable, and the farmers in the suburbs have also started spring plowing. The statement that communist bandits were found in Suiyuan and Baotou is not accurate. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Hunan Department of Finance plans to levy a business tax on banks opened in Hunan, except for the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Hunan Provincial Bank. The Department of Finance was asked for instructions by telegram, and the Ministry of Finance replied that the Ministry is planning to implement a tax on bank business income. The original telegram proposed that a business tax be levied on banks opened in Hunan, except for the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Hunan Provincial Bank. This is not in line with the provisions of the Business Tax Law and the Bank Business Income Tax Law, and it is difficult to approve. However, recently, some money shops in Hunan Province have arbitrarily changed their names to banks in an attempt to evade taxes, which is also inappropriate. They should be ordered to promptly comply with the current banking laws and regulations and submit statutory documents to the Ministry for registration. If they delay in complying, they should be immediately banned in order to prevent trickery and emphasize tax revenue. (Special Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The four signatory countries of the Locarno Treaty, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, held a meeting yesterday and have reached an agreement to study various opportunities for reconciliation, so that the situation caused by Germany's entry into the Rhine can be resolved satisfactorily. The meeting started at 3:00 p.m. and ended at 8:00 p.m. It reconvened at 9:15 p.m. and decided to hold another meeting during the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council on May 11. The Italian representative reserved his opinion on this agreement. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today's meeting of the Locarno signatories decided to authorize British Foreign Secretary Eden to continue negotiations with German leader Hitler in order to resolve the Rhine issue. Although French Foreign Minister Flandin believed that negotiations with Germany could not be conducted, this opposition was not adopted by the meeting, so it can be said that British diplomacy has won another victory. The Locarno Conference then adjourned until the middle of next month, when the French general election should be revealed. (National News Agency Dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the news from the special correspondent of this agency, after the second decision-making meeting of the Locarno signatories, the opinions of Britain and France have become very close. Originally, France thought that the hope of reaching a compromise with Germany had failed, so it advocated implementing the various measures contained in the Locarno Treaty. Now, it has accepted the British opinion and allowed the country to continue its efforts to persuade Germany to accept the principle of collective security. Britain, on the other hand, accepted the French opinion that once Germany builds defensive fortifications in the Rhine region, it should come out to assist France and resist. In addition, the British also based on the memorandum submitted by the French government on April 8 and asked Germany to explain the four points contained in the German memorandum of March 31 in order to know the true intention. The so-called four points are: How can the non-aggression treaties proposed by Germany be integrated with the basic principles of the League of Nations Covenant, that is, the principle of collective security? What is the intention of separating the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles and making it an independent chapter? What is the content of the equal rights demanded by Germany regarding the colonial issue? Regarding the current situation in Austria, the Free City of Danzig, and the Memel Autonomous Region, are there any immediate demands? Is it necessary to immediately change the current borders of Europe? (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The second decision-making meeting of the Locarno Treaty countries (Britain, France, Belgium, and Italy) was held here at 3:30 p.m. British representatives included Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord Privy Seal Halifax; French representatives included Foreign Minister Flandin and Minister Without Portfolio Peng Gu; Belgian representatives included Prime Minister Jilange and Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Su Yilun; and Italian representatives included the Chief Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office Araya West and Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Rocco. Among them, only the Italian representative attended the meeting as an observer. After the meeting began, French Foreign Minister Flandin first read out the confidential memorandum he had submitted to British Foreign Secretary Eden a few days ago, and then began the discussion. There were two recesses in the middle, so that the representatives of each country could consult with their own experts. The meeting ended at 7:40 p.m. After that, the meeting continued at the office of the British delegation at 9:15 p.m. and adjourned at 11:25 p.m.</p>
<p>The following press release was issued: "The Locarno Treaty countries believe that in order to conclude a new treaty to replace the existing treaty, it is necessary to restore credibility first. Regarding this, if the German government can do its best, the countries concerned can immediately conduct general negotiations so that Article 7 of the draft Locarno Treaty can be implemented. (Article 7 states that the various proposals put forward in the German memorandum of March 7 should be participated in by Germany when negotiations begin in the future, but the proposals for non-aggression treaties with Eastern European countries and Germany's return to the League of Nations are not included in this negotiation. The four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium should conduct negotiations to conclude mutual assistance treaties to replace the Locarno Treaties, including the agreements to be concluded by the respective general staffs. The new construction of defensive fortifications in the Rhine region should be prohibited or restricted.) Unfortunately, Germany has failed to do so. However, all attempts to reach a compromise must be tried. For this reason, Germany should explain certain points contained in the German memorandum, which the French memorandum requested to be clarified. This should be contacted by the British government with the German government, allowing it to raise questions with Germany on the following two points, namely: What is the scope of the non-aggression treaties proposed by Germany? How can these treaties be compatible with the principles of collective security and mutual assistance stipulated in the League of Nations Covenant? The French representative stated during the meeting on Thursday that if a major change occurs in the current system of the Rhine River during the future negotiations, France reserves the right to take free action on all possible steps, whether collective or unilateral. The Locarno Treaty countries immediately decided that once such a change occurs, the countries should immediately meet to review it. In addition, the signatories decided to submit the French peace plan to the Executive Council of the League of Nations for discussion. As for whether the German plan can be submitted to the Executive Council together, the consent of the German government should be sought," and so on.</p>
<p>The Italian representative reserved the right to decide in the future whether to approve the above resolution. (Havas Dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) According to this newspaper's diplomatic correspondent, the second Locarno Conference held its meeting today. The discussion was very earnest, and thanks to the mediation of Belgian Prime Minister Janson between British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Flandin, they were able to reach a harmonious understanding. Four points of compromise were established:</p>
<p>Britain believes that the process of reaching a compromise with Germany is not yet complete. Regarding certain points in the German peace plan, Britain will request explanations from Germany on these points, namely: (A) equal rights, (B) the colonial question, and (C) the excision of the Covenant of the League of Nations from the Treaty of Versailles to become an independent chapter.</p>
<p>Talks between the general staffs of France, Belgium, and Britain will begin on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>The signatory powers of the Locarno Treaty will hold a third meeting during the regular session of the Council of the League of Nations next month. However, if an unexpected event occurs, the meeting may be convened earlier.</p>
<p>France reiterates that if Germany builds defensive fortifications in the Rhineland region, France reserves the right to take any measures it deems appropriate.</p>
<p>In addition, this newspaper's correspondent has learned that Italian representative Aloisi raised questions to Britain, France, and Belgium on behalf of the Italian government during the afternoon meeting, stating that British Foreign Secretary Eden's repeated declarations never mentioned Italy. Therefore, he urgently wanted clarification as to whether Britain, France, and Belgium genuinely desired Italian participation in the talks. French Foreign Minister Flandin immediately replied that, personally, he hoped for full Italian cooperation and would welcome the Italian government's approval of the draft agreement decided at the Locarno Conference on March 19. Foreign Secretary Eden said that the crux of Aloisi's question did not lie with the British government but entirely with the Italian government. At that point, Aloisi did not leave the meeting, and the meeting continued. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At yesterday's meeting of the second Locarno Conference, Italian representative Aloisi issued a statement on behalf of the Italian government. The full text of the statement has now been released by the Italian delegation, stating in brief: "Italy was an original signatory and guarantor of the Locarno Treaty. Having made a commitment, it should be respected. However, after Germany abolished this treaty and sent troops into the Rhineland region, the countries involved, one after another, found themselves in special circumstances in London and Paris, and had to adopt a reserved attitude. Unexpectedly, the British government completely ignored Italy. Therefore, the Italian government has instructed its representative to ask: Regarding the reconstruction of Europe, is Italy still needed for cooperation? If Italian cooperation is not necessary, then Italy need not risk danger and bear responsibility for this issue, and should know how to plan for the future." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian representative Aloisi departed for home at 10:15 PM tonight to report the results of the discussions of the Committee of Thirteen and the Locarno Conference to Prime Minister Mussolini. British Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to return home tonight. French Foreign Minister Flandin and Cabinet member Peng Gu are scheduled to return home tomorrow. When the Committee of Thirteen meets next Thursday, the French government will be represented by Peng Gu. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Turkish Chargé d'Affaires to France, Durasi, recently sent a note to Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Léger on behalf of the Turkish government, requesting a revision to Article 18 of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, namely the clause concerning the demilitarization of the Dardanelles Strait. The note stated that since Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty and sent troops into the Rhineland region, the international situation has changed, and the provisions of Article 18 of the Treaty of Lausanne can no longer be effectively implemented. The Turkish government also sent the same note to the other signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne, namely Britain, Italy, Japan, Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Yugoslavia. This move by the Turkish government was already foreshadowed in 1934. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Turkish government recently sent a note to the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne, requesting a revision to Article 18 of the Treaty, namely the clause concerning the demilitarization of the Dardanelles Strait, and sent a copy to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol. The note stated that the Turkish government is prepared to sign a new agreement in the near future to amend the current system in the Dardanelles Strait, to protect Turkish security and ensure freedom of navigation. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Turkish government has also sent a message to the League of Nations, requesting that this matter be included on the agenda of the League of Nations Council meeting beginning on May 11. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Turkish government's request to re-militarize the Dardanelles Strait, responsible figures recently stated that Britain's previous objections were due to fears that Germany would use it as an excuse. Now that the Turkish government has formally submitted a request to the relevant countries in accordance with legal procedures, it is commendable. Moreover, after Germany unilaterally abolished the Locarno Treaty, this request is fully justified. However, the British government must wait until the Rhineland issue is resolved before discussing this matter. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Britain and France have significant differences of opinion regarding the Italian-Ethiopian War, causing great anxiety among the smaller nations. Many criticize the attitude of French Foreign Minister Flandin. At yesterday's meeting of the Committee of Thirteen, which considered methods for immediately starting peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia, Chairman Madariaga first reported on his discussions with Italian representative Aloisi, stating that the Italian side only said that Italy intended to send a special envoy to Geneva after Easter and requested that Madariaga and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol visit Rome. British Foreign Secretary Eden then declared that negotiations should begin immediately and should not be delayed by a trip to Rome, and that the Italian government should be asked to send a representative to Geneva as soon as possible. The committee endorsed Eden's proposal. Chairman Madariaga then proposed that the committee should continue to meet in order to ascertain everything, which Eden strongly supported, saying that Geneva would inevitably involve serious issues. Flandin then rose to object, saying that the committee's staying in session might make the negotiations more difficult. After further discussion, the committee decided to adjourn until April 16, so that the chairman would have time to contact the Italian government and know whether there was hope for a successful negotiation. The committee also approved Eden's motion, resolving that the Committee of Eighteen should be prepared to convene at any time, possibly on Friday. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini telegraphed General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, ordering him to take rapid action on all fronts in Ethiopia. It is believed here that the peace efforts of the League of Nations Committee of Thirteen will soon collapse, and that a critical period in the Italian-Ethiopian conflict is approaching again. Attacks on Britain by the Italian press have also resumed. At the same time, news from the East African front stated that 22 Italian bombers have cleared out the remaining enemy forces between Goran and Taesi, and that the Italian army's advance towards Taesi is now unimpeded. According to eyewitness accounts from pilots, Taesi may have been demilitarized, as many roofs are covered in white cloth. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, 22 Italian aircraft bombed the Ethiopian army positions at Narda Gabo and Sasabana on the southern front yesterday. It is widely believed that this is the prelude to an Italian offensive on the southern front. The telegram also stated that after the Italian air raid, the Italian army occupied positions directly south of Sasabana. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Asmara - According to this newspaper's special correspondent, Baal, the Italian army on the northern front has advanced into the city of Gopo, which is located on the main road to Taesi and is of utmost strategic importance. The Ethiopian Emperor, who was previously supervising the troops on the northern front, has fled south since the defeat of his Imperial Guard at Lake Ashangi. It is known that he was stationed in the city of Adio Uda on April 3. At midnight that day, he went to the city of Guaran and arrived there the next morning. After resting there for two hours, he led over a hundred Imperial Guards on mules southward. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources recently stated that foreign reports that the Ethiopian army has only 5,500 men left since the Battle of Lake Ashangi are completely unfounded. The report that the Ethiopian Emperor has again appealed to the British government for assistance, while alarming, is also without foundation. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The statement by British Admiral Keyes, "The Royal Navy is fully prepared to respond to any action by Mussolini," has aroused extreme dissatisfaction among political figures here, who consider it a most unfriendly expression. The Italian Foreign Ministry mouthpiece, *Il Giornale d'Italia*, published an editorial today targeting this statement, stating in brief: "Italy has never threatened any civilized nation in the world. At the same time, if other countries threaten or provoke us, Italy will use all its naval, land, and air forces to resist them without any hesitation. The Italian expedition to Ethiopia is solely to maintain the safety of its colonies and does not seek to infringe on the interests of other countries. This has been repeatedly stated solemnly by the authorities in recent days and should dispel the doubts of other countries." It is noted that the editor of *Il Giornale d'Italia* was summoned by the Prime Minister yesterday, so this comment can be considered a warning from the Italian government to the British naval authorities. Since the Italian forces in East Africa cleared the Lake Tana area, anti-Italian sentiment among the British has become particularly strong. The attitude of the British representative at the recent meeting of the Committee of Thirteen has also become more assertive, deeply angering Mussolini, who issued a firm statement at the cabinet meeting that "we must annihilate all Ethiopian forces." The Italian delegation was instructed not to participate in the Committee of Thirteen before departing for Geneva. British opinions are becoming increasingly extreme, and the efforts of the Committee of Thirteen will be even more futile. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>

Financiers here claim that if China can maintain a trade surplus with the US, the current exchange rate between the Chinese currency and the US dollar can be maintained. According to commercial experts, China's trade surplus with the US is largely due to the strong sales of tung oil in the US. As for US trade with Japan, Japan also achieved a trade surplus in February. The total value of US exports to Japan was US$13,215,000, while US imports from Japan were $14,531,000. In January, the total value of US exports to Japan was $18,753,000, while imports were $15,383,000. As for silver imports, their source has changed greatly. In February, imports came entirely from Mexico, Canada, Peru, Soviet Russia, and Chile. Although Britain was previously a major supplier, it now has almost no silver imports to the US. Chen Guangfu, representative of the Chinese banking community, consulted with experts from the Department of the Treasury again today, but did not meet with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. Guo Bingwen studied tung oil sales with officials from the Department of Commerce. (National Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>(New York) *The New York Commercial* published an editorial today stating that the US is very concerned about China's new currency system, not only because the US silver purchase policy has greatly affected China, but also because China is an important market for American goods. The Chinese government has also sold a large amount of silver to the US at prices exceeding the world market price, which is sufficient to consolidate the credit of the Chinese currency. Now that the Bank of China has established a branch in New York, it can freely purchase silver dollars here, causing a linked relationship between the Chinese currency and the US dollar. Chinese representatives Chen Guangfu and others are currently negotiating with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau. If this matter is successful, then China will be the first country in the dollar bloc.

<p>(Moscow) On April 10, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov received Japanese Ambassador Ota and protested that armed forces from Manchuria had invaded Soviet territory in the Grodekovo area and opened fire on Soviet border guards 1,000 meters inside Soviet territory. This is according to a report from the Khabarovsk Telegraph Agency on April 9. Ota, representing the Japanese government, protested the same incident, saying that the conflict occurred in Manchurian territory and was caused by Soviet border guards firing on Japanese troops. According to Ota's report, three Japanese soldiers died. (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Khabarovsk reports that at 2:30 PM on April 9, five border guards from the Sosnovoye outpost discovered that someone had invaded 1,000 meters into Soviet territory north of Razsipnaye from Manchuria. The number of intruders is unknown. The border guards signaled them to stop, but the intruders opened fire. After a 20-minute exchange, the intruders retreated back into Manchurian territory. (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Fukuoka) For the sake of guarding northern Manchuria, the Shimizu unit, which received a very enthusiastic send-off, departed for its first assignment yesterday. Now, the Second Advance Regiment, consisting of the Yakiyama, Iizuka, Hattori, and Tajiri units, are following in its wake and are scheduled to depart by ship on the 16th for their assigned posts. At a time when Soviet troops are recklessly committing acts with impunity on the Soviet-Manchurian border and conflicts are frequent, the departure after the First Advance Regiment is under a state of very high alert.

<p>(Harbin) This city's Japanese military intelligence agency previously discovered a powerful radio station sending secret codes to Vladivostok by detecting radio waves. Immediately concluding that it was being done by Soviet spies, it immediately mobilized a large number of personnel to investigate. It discovered a suspicious house in this city and surrounded and searched it on the night of the other day. Unexpectedly, the other party escaped from the area just one minute before the Japanese surrounded it. The Japanese are currently actively searching for them. (Hualian Telegram, 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e47">Japan's peacetime army plans to increase to 25 divisions. This is the hope of the Ministry of the Army. <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Considering the international situation after the Manchurian Incident and the state of military preparations of various powers, there are many who hope to increase the peacetime strength of the Japanese army. Minister of the Army Terauchi is resolved to clearly state this policy at a special session of parliament, indicating the future goals for strengthening the army's armaments. After the European war, various countries around the world, based on their experiences in the war, have been focusing on strengthening their armaments and modern equipment, and are steadily implementing plans. Japan is the only country that is going against this trend, still maintaining the old-fashioned equipment from before the European war. Furthermore, in the first resolution for army reduction in Taisho 10 (1921), five divisions were reduced, and in the second resolution for reorganization in Taisho 14 (1925), three divisions were reduced. The army's peacetime strength plan planned after the European war, the hope for a standing army of 25 divisions, was suppressed and never implemented. It was with the Manchurian Incident as an opportunity that the situation in East Asia changed, and the empire, as a stabilizing force in East Asia, shouldered even greater responsibilities, so the army's arguments were gradually recognized. However, while European and American powers are strengthening their armaments, the equipment of the Japanese army, which is proceeding in the opposite direction, is far inferior to that of European and American countries. Therefore, the proposal to increase to 25 divisions is the unanimous wish of the Ministry of the Army and can be said to have become apparent. Minister of the Army Terauchi will explain in detail the aforementioned historical context in a future speech on strengthening armaments at a special session of parliament, frankly stating the true intentions of the military.

<h3 id="e48">The Hindenburg Airship Safely Flies Back to its Home Country; Closely Monitored While Passing Through France <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Friedrichshafen - The German airship *Hindenburg* safely flew back to its base here after noon today, amidst cheers from 5,000 spectators singing the national anthem. As the airship descended here, Director Eckener leaned out of the window, his face pale and anxious. Those who saw him cheered even louder. Locals were initially concerned about the safety of the crew and 18 passengers after hearing news that one of the airship's engines had been damaged and that it was struggling against the wind off Gibraltar. They were greatly relieved to see it return safely. The French Aviation Ministry granted permission for the airship to pass through French territory on its return journey, but stipulated that the airship must not cross more than ten kilometers beyond the banks of the Rhone River. According to a Reuters correspondent on board the airship, the engine located on the front of the port side malfunctioned on Wednesday evening and was dismantled. As it flew off the French coast, a French airplane circled around the *Hindenburg*. Seeing that its propulsion system was not moving, it knew that its engine was indeed damaged. After the French aircraft returned to the coast, a seaplane also flew in to investigate. Soon after, another plane from Mimes also came to inspect. Captain Lehmann stated that the damaged engine had been repaired, but could only be used in an emergency. This was not the result of poor construction, as such damage is unavoidable when motors are actively tested and new oil is used. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The airship *Hindenburg* returned from Brazil, encountering wind and damaging its machinery on the way, forcing it to shorten its journey and pass through France. It safely arrived at Friedrichshafen at 6:40 PM. The round trip between Germany and Brazil took 11 days, covered 21,260 kilometers, the actual flight time was 216 hours, the average speed was 100 kilometers per hour, it passed through 10 countries on three continents, crossed the vast Atlantic Ocean, carrying 73 passengers, 53 crew members, 1,500 kilograms of cargo, 3,000 kilograms of food, and 60,000 kilograms of fuel. The airship itself weighed 112,000 kilograms. The journey from Germany to Brazil was smooth, but on the return journey, it suddenly encountered a storm off the coast of Africa, damaging one of the four engines it was equipped with. Although the ship's engineer immediately repaired it, it was never used. Captain Lehmann stated that this misfortune was not unusual, and that the advantages of the new diesel heavy oil engine were not diminished by it. All of the engines started and ran continuously for 330 hours, which shows their durability. As for the economy of fuel, it was also amazing. The two trips covered more than 21,000 kilometers, and the fuel consumed was less than 40,000 liters. On the return journey, some passengers requested to fly over the Alps, but I refused the request because the wind direction and weather conditions there at that time were unfavorable for flight. As for requesting permission from the French authorities to pass through their airspace, it was due to the engine damage and weather conditions. After we entered French territory, we followed the Rhone River, passing through the cities of Bourg-en-Bresse, Besançon, and Basel in Switzerland, before returning here. I am very satisfied with this trip, and I hope that all the passengers are also satisfied. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>

<p>Alps Tunnel to be Excavated, Committee to be Established by France, Italy, and Switzerland</p>
<p>(Paris) Mont Blanc in the Alps is the highest peak in Europe, located at the intersection of France, Italy, and Switzerland. Until now, there has been no tunnel, and travelers must detour, which is quite inconvenient. It has recently been learned that people from France, Italy, and Switzerland have jointly established a committee to plan the excavation of a tunnel, which will begin this summer. According to the "Industry Daily" magazine, the three-country committee sent geological experts to the vicinity of Mont Blanc to conduct on-site investigations and compile a report for review. It is understood that construction there is not difficult. There are no hot springs in the granite rock walls to hinder construction. The northern entrance of the tunnel is in Chamonix, France, at an altitude of 1,035 meters. The southern entrance is two kilometers away from Entreves, at an altitude of 1,305 meters. The total length of the tunnel is 12 kilometers and 600 meters, with a width of eight meters. After completion, cars can pass through. However, when cars are driving, they emit a lot of carbon gas. If there is no equipment for circulating air, this carbon gas will fill the tunnel and harm travelers. This problem can also be solved by excavating a small tunnel below the tunnel to transport fresh air and discharge turbid air. Carbon gas detectors will also be installed in the large tunnel. If the carbon gas content is too high and affects breathing, these detectors will automatically detect it. Then the alarm bell will ring, so that the management personnel can open the fresh air circulation mechanism to achieve a regulating effect. Also, an exit will be set every 200 meters, so that cars in the tunnel can drive to a passageway filled with fresh air. As for the problems of regulating light and setting up traffic signals, they will also be solved by scientific methods. Therefore, cars do not need to turn on lights when driving in the tunnel. The signals are all lit with lights to direct traffic. As for the funding, at the beginning of the construction, two-thirds of the basic funds will be borne by French banking groups. This amount can be repaid in installments over 50 years. It is estimated that after the tunnel is completed, a toll can be charged according to the weight of the car and the number of people carried, and it is expected that at least 120,000 cars will pass through each year.

<p>Koreans are a part of the puppet organization, the increasing number of immigrants are often arrogant and lawless</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence, Before the September 18th Incident, the number of Koreans who came to the Northeast to make a living gradually increased. There were some illegal acts, but under the Chinese regime, they did not dare to be too presumptuous. However, after the incident, the puppet organization was established, and the Koreans also considered themselves to be a part of the puppet organization. Therefore, arrogant and lawless incidents were often heard. The local people were oppressed by them and could do nothing about it. Also, the Koreans regarded the Northeast as a rich agricultural area. Korean farmers were directed by the Japanese to move there, or they came to the Northeast on their own. The number of them was countless. The following is a brief record of the activities of Korean farmers in the Northeast last year and their cultivation status.</p>

<h3 id="e67">Peiping, Incident of Two Newspapers Being Destroyed <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Resolved After Mediation and Earnest Discussion, Muslims Will Celebrate with the Press</p>
<p>Peiping Correspondence, On the 5th and 6th of this month, the Peiping World Evening News and Citizen News successively reprinted a correspondence about Xinjiang customs titled "Hami Produces Beautiful Women". Local Muslims believed that it insulted the Islamic faith. On the 7th, they sent letters to the two newspapers, issuing a warning. The World Evening News immediately corrected the article on the 7th according to the publication law. However, the Citizen News did not receive the letter and was therefore unable to respond. As a result, on the morning of the 8th, at around 9:00 AM, members of the Muslim community gathered at the Qingzhen Mosque in Tianqiao. It was raining lightly, and the Muslims gathered in the rain to reach more than 300 people. They marched in formation to Xuanwu Gate and then to the Citizen News office at No. 7 Xianglai Street, where they carried out the destruction. All 24 rooms of the building were completely destroyed. The printing presses, lead type, and equipment in all departments were also completely ruined. At 12:30 PM, they went to the World Evening News on West Chang'an Street to carry out the destruction. At around 1:00 PM, because the goal had been achieved, they dispersed.</p>
<p>The losses suffered by the two newspapers were astonishing because there was no preparation in advance and no resistance. In addition to the fact that the Citizen News was temporarily unable to resume publication, the World Evening News was able to continue publishing because the printing factory was fortunately not affected. At the time, the attitude of the authorities of the two newspapers was very cautious and unwilling to make any statement. However, the local authorities were fair in their handling of the matter, but paid close attention to the issue of responsibility for the incident. When the Muslims departed from Tianqiao, the two newspapers telegraphed the Second District Police Department to send police to protect them. As a result, the director of the department, Zhu Dezhi, only sent three policemen to the scene, which made it impossible to prevent the unfortunate incident. The authorities also attached great importance to this point because it concerned public security and stated that they would thoroughly investigate it as a warning to those who neglected their duties. As of now, one patrol officer has been dismissed.</p>
<p>After the two newspapers were destroyed, the Muslims established a temporary joint association of various Muslim organizations at the West Temple in Niujie at around 2:00 PM that afternoon as an agency dedicated to dealing with this incident. On the morning of the 9th, they held an emergency meeting and passed six resolutions, including requesting the authorities to ban the recurrence of similar incidents in various newspapers and demanding compensation for reputational damage of 140,000 yuan (calculated at one yuan per person for the 140,000 Muslims in Peiping). At around 1:00 PM on the same afternoon, they gathered in front of Tiananmen Square, preparing to go to the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee and the Peiping Municipal Government to petition for protection. Fearing that the situation would escalate, the authorities immediately ordered Ma Yulin, the captain of the Detective Brigade, to rush to persuade them, promising to discuss the matter in the long term. The Muslims then dispersed and waited for a solution. That night at 8:00 PM, the Municipal Government sent Commissioner Wu Lengzhai, together with Qian Zongchao, the Chief Inspector of the Public Security Bureau, Ma Yulin, the Captain of the Detective Brigade, and Guan Yixian, the representative of the Journalists Association, to meet with Muslim representatives at the Northwest Middle School. After earnest discussions, a mediation plan was decided. The authorities instructed that the measures of the Five Races and One Family promulgated by the Central Government should be followed, and Muslims should not be discriminated against. A circular was issued to all newspapers stating that there should be no more insulting words about Islam.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed not to pursue each other's losses. The two newspapers published notices apologizing to the Muslims. The two newspapers punished those responsible. After the above plan was agreed upon, the mediator informed the two newspapers. The Citizen News, because it was still in suspension, decided to comply when it resumed publication. The World Evening News received a reply from its president, Cheng Shewo, in Shanghai after sending a telegram and published a notice in its evening newspaper on the 10th. The original text stated, "This newspaper published an article titled "Hami Produces Beautiful Women" on April 5th. It was done in haste and without careful review. After it was discovered by Muslims, they believed that it was inconsistent with the facts. Islam is the largest religion in the world, and its teachings are peaceful and its beliefs are pure. It attaches great importance to ethics and morality, and ethnic equality and freedom of religion are enshrined in the Provisional Constitution. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the National Government reiterated the ban, strictly prohibiting discrimination against any religion. Due to a temporary oversight, this unfortunate incident occurred. This newspaper has always respected laws and regulations, and respects and admires Islam. In addition to punishing those responsible, it is necessary to correct the error and sincerely apologize to all Muslims. We hope for your understanding."</p>
<p>The Peiping Municipal Authorities instructed the Public Security Bureau on the same afternoon to assist and instruct all newspapers to earnestly respect religions, not to harbor any discrimination, and not to arbitrarily belittle them. The original order stated, "Ethnic equality and freedom of religion are enshrined in the law. The government has always respected, supported, and protected all ethnic groups and religions in the country, and the Executive Yuan has issued a circular to this effect. However, it has been found that various newspapers have recently reprinted articles related to Islam, which were either carelessly reviewed or were close to insulting, affecting local order. It is hereby ordered that the bureau be directed to instruct all newspapers to strictly abide by the circulars and resolutions of the Executive Yuan, not to discriminate against any religion, and not to arbitrarily belittle them. This order is of utmost importance."</p>
<p>Therefore, the incident between the Muslims and the two newspapers was completely resolved. The World Evening News is currently working hard to handle the aftermath. On the Muslim side, it is planned to host a gathering for the press in the city next week to remove past grievances and restore good relations. (April 10th)</p>
<p>All Counties in Jiangxi Province Completely Lift Blockade</p>
<p>The Last Batch of 50 Counties</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, After the extermination of the Red bandits in Jiangxi Province, some of the counties that were blockaded during the bandit suppression period had already lifted the blockade and restored the freedom of the people to trade. However, parts of eighteen counties, including Pengze, and all of thirty-two counties, including Xingguo, were still under public sale of oil and salt because the scattered bandits had not been completely eliminated and the Baojia system had not been completed. Only those with good citizen certificates could obtain the supply of edible salt and kerosene. The provincial government has successively approved the lifting of the blockade in the above-mentioned areas based on the reports from the garrison commissioners and county governments of each area that the clearing of the countryside has been completed and the Baojia system has been completed. It has specially requested the approval of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to lift the blockade in the above-mentioned areas so that merchants and people in the province can freely trade. It is heard that a reply has been received approving it. These are the last counties to have the blockade lifted. The names of the counties are as follows: Pengze, Ruichang, De'an, Yongxiu, Wuning, Xiushui, Jing'an, Fengxin, Tonggu, Pingxiang, Shangrao, Guangfeng, Qianshan, Guixi, Guangze, and other sixteen counties, and parts of Yichun and Wanzai counties, Fuliang, Poyang, Wuyuan, Leping, Deyu, Wannian, Yushan, Hengfeng, Yiyang, Anyi, Yifeng, Fenyi, Anfu, Lianfan, Yongxin, Ninggang, Suichuan, Ji'an, Jishui, Taihe, Wan'an, Le'an, Yongfeng, Yuguo, Yihuang, Nanfeng, Guangchang, Liandu, Shicheng, Yudu, Ruijin, Huichang, and other thirty-two counties.

<h3 id="e68">Rice Prices in Guangdong and Guangxi Still Rising <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Expedites Construction of Warehouses Everywhere, Guangxi Levies Export Duties on Rice</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence, Recently, in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, due to the period between the exhaustion of old crops and the ripening of new crops, the demand for rice and grain exceeds the supply. Merchants in various places have been purchasing them one after another to hoard and speculate. Therefore, the two provinces have prohibited the export of rice and grain for the past month to maintain the people's food supply. In order to regulate the supply of rice and grain, Guangdong Province has implemented a reduction of one-fourth of the import tariff rate on foreign rice to compensate for the high price of foreign rice due to the rising foreign exchange rate. Also, the Provincial Food Regulation Association, considering the shortage of rice and grain in the interior and to prevent famine, has requested the authorities to order the counties and cities to expedite the storage of grain for famine relief and to submit a statement on building general warehouses everywhere for hoarding grain. After receiving the statement, the provincial government has forwarded the case to the relevant agencies for review. On the 1st of this month, the provincial government resolved to allocate 150,000 yuan from the provincial treasury to build three major grain storage warehouses in Xingning and Yangyang in the East River and Qujiang in the North River. Each warehouse will cost 50,000 yuan and will be constructed within a month. It is heard that eight grain storage sub-warehouses will be established in various counties. The locations for establishing the sub-warehouses have been selected as Wengyuan, Yingde, Nanhai, Zengcheng, Maoming, Qinzhou, Haifeng, Huiyang, and other eight counties. If the counties cannot raise the funds to build the sub-warehouses in time, the Food Association will provide subsidies as appropriate to ensure that they are fully established within three months.</p>
<p>Guangxi Province, which was originally a surplus rice area, has unexpectedly experienced a phenomenon of rising rice prices since the beginning of spring. It is heard that this is due to unscrupulous merchants purchasing and hoarding. Wuzhou Port implemented a ban on rice exports at seven yuan per unit last month. Recently, it has risen to ten yuan per hundred catties, and the livelihood of the poor people is becoming more and more difficult. At present, the Guilin Chamber of Commerce and the local defense army commander have discussed relief measures. It is heard that it is planned to release 150,000 stones of rice stored in the Guilin granary and hold a fair distribution to benefit the people's livelihood. At the same time, the Guilin County Government has strictly controlled the export of grain and rice. The Guangxi Provincial Government has recently received reports of high rice prices from various places and has implemented the collection of export duties on rice to prohibit exports through taxation. Yesterday, it ordered the Guangxi Taxation Bureau to comply. After receiving the order, the bureau issued a notice at the beginning of the month to start collecting taxes. The notice stated, "According to the telegram from the Provincial Government, it was reported that rice prices in Cangwu, Guilin, Wuxuan, He County, Xindu, and other counties were soaring and requesting a ban on rice exports. The Wuzhou Taxation Bureau was instructed to investigate and found that the export of white rice has accounted for one-third compared with last year, brown rice accounted for one-fourth, and rice accounted for one-sixth. White rice is mostly exported, which is because it is currently the peak month and there are more foreign sales. The export is not indicative of famine. In order to prohibit exports through taxation, it has been verified that the export of brown rice and rice will be subject to a tax of five cents for every hundred city catties, except for white rice, which will continue to be exempt from export duties to show restriction. You should immediately comply with the notification to the public and instruct your subordinates to comply with the report." (April 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e70">Wuxi, Refugee Robbery <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, more than 80 refugees from other provinces suddenly arrived in the Taoji Township, Tao Dian Bridge area of the Second District, east of the railway outside the East Gate. They were in a disheveled state and not only forcibly asked farmers for food, but also took the opportunity to rob rice and livestock. Fifty to sixty chickens and ducks were robbed. When the villagers saw this, they chased after them. When they chased to Yinjia Bridge, the refugees took out sharp knives and sticks, intending to use force. Zhao, a patrol officer from a branch station of the Public Security Bureau, heard about it and immediately sent policemen to suppress it, which prevented the incident from escalating. A refugee named Han Zhuolai was arrested and six chickens were found. He was taken to the station for investigation. Also, the families of Feng Ronglin and Feng Amao, villagers in Chenxiang Village, Wangzhuang Town, Sitou Town, Fifth District, were robbed by ninety-six bandits, and a villager named Ge Quanpei was injured.</p>

<p>The term of office of the executive and supervisory committee members of the Wuyi County Chamber of Commerce has expired. The members' general meeting was originally scheduled to be held on March 15th of this year for re-election. The meeting was postponed because the re-election of the various industry guilds had not been completed. The association held a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees on the afternoon of the 10th to discuss the date of the third general meeting of members. Because the re-election of various guilds has not been completed, it should be re-scheduled. Please decide on the case.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Yangzhou: Concerns Over the Melon Causeway Lead to a Petition from Dike Residents <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Resolution: The meeting is scheduled to be held on May 15th. The second district of the county mostly borders the Yangtze River. During the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic, the dikes of Guazhou and Six Dikes nearby were destroyed, causing the collapse of many dike fields. Subsequently, in the 21st year of the Republic, officials and civilians cooperated to shorten the dike by more than 100 feet and build a new bank to protect the undamaged fields. Unexpectedly, recently, the new embankment in the Guadong area has once again approached the collapsed area. Moreover, the current year's river water is flowing with great force, and there is a risk of further collapse. The district head of the area, Zang Liuqi, learning from the past experience of the 20th year of the Republic, requested the county government to appoint Xu Kuan-yu, Liu Shi-zong, Chen Yu-shu, and others, the township heads of the collapsed sections, as the chief and deputy directors in charge of preparing for repairs and defenses. However, the project is difficult and requires huge sums of money, which cannot be completed in a short time by a small number of people. Therefore, the chief and deputy directors have been unable to come up with a solution. Local people such as Liu Changchun and Ma Yunqing have stated that the peach flood is approaching soon. If work is not started quickly before the busy farming season arrives, the tragedy of the past will be repeated this year. It is said that these people have repeatedly jointly petitioned the county government and plan to send representatives to the city to appeal, hoping to build a new bank as soon as possible to avoid an irreversible collapse. It is reported that the county government is also paying special attention to this matter and has ordered the Construction Bureau to send personnel to Guadong and the Ji Jia Port area to conduct on-site surveys.</p>

<p>Lei Runqin, a merchant from the Xin Sheng Paper Shop in Bengbu, purchased a plot of land on Second Ma Road in the 14th year of the Republic at a certain price. The contract he held had already been verified according to law. Lei Shi-rong, a shop assistant from the paper shop, was suddenly summoned by the head of the Fengyang County Deed Tax Bureau a month ago and subsequently transferred to the Fengyang County Government for detention. He was detained for more than 40 days. Later, the county government sent personnel to investigate and verify the land contracts, which were found to be legal documents. The Deed Tax Bureau then sent a letter to the county government requesting the release of Lei Shi-rong. Unexpectedly, the county government recently issued another summons for Lei Runqin, ordering him to appear in court within three days for interrogation. Lei expressed great indignation because the contract had already been verified. He requested the Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to the provincial government and the Ministry of Finance to stop the illegal actions of Fengyang County. The Chamber of Commerce, based on the letter, telegraphed separately on the 10th, requesting a swift order to stop the actions in order to protect human rights.</p>
<p>Artistic Musings</p>
<p>Thousands of Willows Outside the Red Railing Bridge (Part 2)</p>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>Green symbolizes peace. Therefore, green flags are used at train stations to signal that trains are allowed to proceed, and green lights are used on roads to indicate that vehicles are allowed to move forward. Although these are man-made symbols, their selection is not without natural basis. Imagine if red and green were replaced with two other colors, such as yellow and purple, or blue and orange, they would be far less natural than red and green, and would be more difficult to remember. Drivers might cause accidents due to misidentification. Only the two colors, red and green, are natural and easy to remember. Drivers can intuitively feel the situation ahead from the colors of the lights, without having to memorize the meaning of these symbols. The human eyes and body's senses are cleverly interconnected. When the color red enters the eyes, the body's senses naturally become tense. When the color green enters the eyes, the body's senses naturally become relaxed. It is certainly possible to force oneself to appear calm when seeing red, or to force oneself to appear tense when seeing green; however, it is not human nature. Moving further from peace, green also symbolizes love. Therefore, postmen who deliver messages wear green uniforms. Esperanto scholars use the color green, which symbolizes peace and love, as their symbol. These are all very meaningful stipulations. Generally speaking, humanity's understanding of the symbolic power of green began with natural objects. Like today, on a sunny spring day, the grass and trees are thriving, the mountains and fields are covered in new greenery, and people's hearts are most joyful. Imagine in a few months, the green trees are dense, covering the sky and earth, the mountains and fields are filled with natural green lawns and curtains, and people's hearts are most comfortable. Therefore, all qualities such as joy, harmony, peace, love, nature, and comfort can be associated with the colors of nature. In short, green is a symbol of tranquility.</p>
<p>Red and green together create a sense of beauty, as can be deduced from the various examples and symbolic powers mentioned above. Red symbolizes vitality, and green symbolizes tranquility. Being both vibrant and tranquil is the most ideal life. Since ancient times, people in prosperous times have had these two emotions saturated and blended in their hearts. The colors of the current "Thousands of Willows Outside the Red Railing Bridge" are precisely a symbol of a prosperous time.</p>
<p>This can also be explained from the perspective of color theory: All colors in the world are created by variations of red, yellow, and blue. Therefore, red, yellow, and blue are called the "three primary colors." Each of the three primary colors has its own characteristics: red is passionate, yellow is solemn, and blue is serene. When two primary colors are combined, they become "three secondary colors," that is, red and yellow become orange, red and blue become purple, and yellow and blue become green. The three secondary colors also each have their own characteristics: orange is passionate plus solemn, that is, sacred; purple is passionate plus serene, that is, noble; green is solemn plus serene, that is, peaceful. By repeatedly combining them, countless colors with countless characteristics can be produced. Now, when red and green are combined, in other words, red is combined with yellow and blue. In contrast, all three primary colors are present, in other words, all colors in the world are included. Therefore, when it enters the eyes, the sensation is saturated and complete, without any deficiency. It can be seen that the reason why the contrast between red and green makes people feel satisfied is fundamentally due to the presence of all three primary colors. However, the contrast of all three primary colors is not limited to the combination of red and green alone. Yellow and purple (red and blue), blue and orange (red and yellow), are also combinations of all three primary colors. Why is the combination of red and green particularly satisfying? This is due to the different characteristics of the three primary colors. Colors are divided into two categories, yin and yang, with red being the leader of yang; colors are divided into two categories, light and dark, with red being the leader of light; colors are divided into two categories, warm and cold, with red being the leader of warm. Yang is stronger than yin, light is stronger than dark, and warm is stronger than cold. Therefore, red is the strongest of the three primary colors, stronger than yellow, and yellow is stronger than blue. Therefore, using the combined force of yellow and blue (green) to contrast red is the most evenly matched. Red and blue (purple) against yellow is not as balanced. Red and yellow (orange) against blue is even less balanced. From their symbolism, this principle can also be understood: passion, solemnity, and serenity, in terms of the needs of human emotion, also form a diminishing difference. Passion is first, solemnity is second, and serenity is last. Those who emphasize serenity lose their gentleness, and those who emphasize solemnity lose their strength. Only those who emphasize passion can achieve the correctness of yin and yang, strength and gentleness, and meet the needs of human vigor, suitable for the mood of a vibrant person. Therefore, simple primitive people like red and green; innocent children like red and green; people celebrating like red and green; and I, wandering along the West Lake, basking in the warm sun and gentle breeze, forgetting the worries of the times, also like the saturation of the colors of "Thousands of Willows Outside the Red Railing Bridge," and therefore temporarily experience the happy mood of the people in a prosperous age.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these thousands of willows will soon wither and decline. I fear that in the future, when spring returns to summer, and the autumn air is bleak, the peaceful green will disappear, leaving only the insurance-like color of the red railing bridge dominating the natural world, and running rampant in the gray environment. However, at that time, no one will come to the West Lake to admire the scenery, and I will no longer wander here. March 18, Year 15 [of the Republic].</p>

<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, received a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency yesterday afternoon at 6:30 p.m. at the Central Bank and made the following important statements:</p>
<p>Effectiveness of Monetary Policy</p>
<p>It has been half a year since the implementation of the new monetary policy. Fortunately, with the support of the people, it has been very effective, which is gratifying. Recently, foreign exchange has stabilized, export trade has increased significantly, and domestic industry and commerce have gradually become active due to the easing of credit. In the future, the government should follow the established guidelines and implement them effectively, so that the country's finances and social economy will become more stable.</p>
<p>Establishing County and Township Banks</p>
<p>After the implementation of the legal tender policy, the Central Bank system is currently undergoing legislative procedures. The Central Reserve Bank will soon be established. The Ministry of Finance is currently drafting commercial and local banking laws and plans to establish county and township banks. In the future, the Ministry of Finance and the people will jointly organize these banks, so that the government and the people can work together to fully promote the great effect of promoting national economic development.</p>
<p>Organizing Financial Plans</p>
<p>As for organizing financial plans, preparations have also been completed. The most important thing is to seek a balance in the national budget. The total budget for the next fiscal year should still be based on the total expenditure for this fiscal year in order to achieve a balance between income and expenditure, maintain the credit of legal tender, pay attention to the development of national production, determine an economic policy of self-reliance and regeneration, and put the country on the path to prosperity. It is hoped that the people will all base themselves on patriotism and give the government sincere and close cooperation. The revival of the nation depends on this.</p>

<p>Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, Discusses His Thoughts on the Anniversary of the Purification Campaign</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Today is the anniversary of the Purification Campaign. The reporter interviewed Yang Hu, the current commander of the Songhu Garrison, who was the first garrison commander on this day 16 years ago, about his feelings on this anniversary. Yang Hu made extraordinary efforts and contributed to the Party. He responded as follows: The Purification Campaign was to eliminate the Red bandits who harmed the country and the people and to consolidate the Party's lifeline. It was a concrete manifestation of the Party's saving the country, saving the nation, protecting the interests and peace of the people. At that time, people's hearts were fluctuating and many were lured by the Reds. All fences were removed, and people wanted to return to a primitive world. Farmers, workers, merchants, and young students all went astray. The survival of the Party and the country was at stake. Shanghai was a place where Chinese and foreigners lived together, making reconnaissance difficult. The Red bandits, who had lost their minds, often used this as a hiding place, creating elements of rebellion. During this period, I was responsible for punishing the wicked and maintaining law and order. I dared not but work hard to thoroughly purge them. Fortunately, with the help of the concessions and friends, I achieved considerable results and did not fail to meet expectations. This is my duty, and there is no merit to speak of. In recent years, the Red bandits have been rampant. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the armed comrades have worked hard to complete the task. However, the times are difficult, even more so than in the past. I have a great responsibility for the security of the people of Shanghai. I should still uphold the spirit of the Purification Campaign in the past, eliminate bandits, and strive to maintain law and order. However, my personal abilities are limited, and I still rely on the help of all sectors. I also hope that the press will express their great opinions from time to time and be generous in their teachings, so that I can achieve the goal of protecting the Party and the people.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Silk Manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Discuss Borrowing Large Sums to Purchase Cocoons: An Amount of 20 Million Yuan, Guaranteed by the Purchased Cocoons; Bank Meeting Decides on Principles and Agrees <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>In order to purchase spring cocoons, silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly discussed borrowing large sums of money from banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Banks have expressed their agreement in principle. The silk factories have scheduled a joint meeting for 4 p.m. today at the Shanghai Silk Cocoon Association on North Shaanxi Road to discuss the number of cocoons each factory needs to purchase and the amount of money they need to borrow. Then, they will continue to contact the banks for further negotiations. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>No Extension Allowed</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Silk Control Committee's interim measures for the control and management of cocoon collection for the spring of the 25th year have been announced and implemented. The regulations are quite strict. All silk factory merchants inside and outside the province who purchase improved cocoons and local cocoons in the cocoon-producing areas of Zhejiang Province must apply to the committee for registration before April 15th. Otherwise, they will be refused to purchase in Zhejiang Province. The silk factory associations of Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Wuxi believe that the committee's restrictions are too strict and the deadline is too short, and the procedures for raising funds are not enough to handle. They jointly applied for an extension of the deadline, but yesterday the committee issued a decision not to allow it. It was decided that the registration deadline would be April 15th, and no further extension would be granted.</p>
<p>Joint Borrowing</p>
<p>Silk manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have generally borrowed money from banks to purchase cocoons in previous years, or the banks have automatically purchased them and resold them to the silk manufacturers. This spring, the silk factories have decided to jointly borrow from banks and have already started negotiations. According to Chu Hui-seng, a leader of the silk cocoon merchants, the silk manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have jointly borrowed a large sum of money from banks such as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Representatives have been sent to contact Song Hanzhang, General Manager of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, several times. The amount of the loan ranges from 15 million to 20 million yuan. According to past practice, the purchased cocoons are used as collateral. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and other banks held a joint meeting on the 8th of this month. As a result of the discussion, they decided to accept the principle of the loan. The exact amount and all other methods are still to be decided. It is generally hoped that it will be successful.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Sino-French International Trade Has Greatly Developed Recently <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Translated by the Foreign Press Agency from the French Chamber of Commerce Monthly in China: According to the French Commercial Counselor's Office, trade between China and France has greatly developed in recent years, and the future prospects are even better. Since the beginning of trade between China and France, China has always been in a surplus position, which is extremely beneficial to China. According to French statistics for 1935, Chinese goods imported into France amounted to 141 million francs per year, ranking 27th in the French import list. According to French statistics for 1935, French goods imported into China amounted to 88 million francs per year, ranking 22nd in the French export list. According to the French business authorities, there are four reasons why commercial measurement between China and France has failed to be developed: 1. Chinese and French goods are not essential goods in the eyes of both parties, so they cannot arouse the desire to purchase. 2. China and France are too far apart. 3. Chinese and French merchants lack in-depth research on the needs of each other's markets. 4. There are too many privately manufactured counterfeit goods in China and France, which cannot gain market credibility. According to the statistics of the Chinese Customs in 1935, trade between China and France in 1935 was indeed an increase compared to 1934, and China was still in a favorable position. The following table clarifies: (Gold Units)</p>
<p>From its total, the trade between China and France in 1935 was really an increase compared to 1934, and the most notable point is that the number of Chinese goods transported to France increased and the number of French goods transported to China decreased. From this, it can be seen that the purchasing power of the Chinese people has been greatly reduced. As for the trade between China and the French colonies, China is once again a country that has been surpassed, but this is true only in the case of Indochina, while the other French colonies are different. The following table clarifies separately:</p>

<h3 id="e83">Wang Zhengting Discusses筹赎 Redemption of the Jiaoji Railway <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Also Discusses Sino-Japanese Relations and the Soviet-Mongolian Agreement</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Wang Zhengting, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Government, recently went to Nanjing to negotiate the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway. After returning to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he received a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency at his residence yesterday morning. He discussed the progress of the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway and his observations on the Sino-Japanese situation. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiaoji Railway Expires Next Year</p>
<p>Wang said in response to a reporter's question that, regarding the redemption of the Jiaoji Railway, after the Washington Conference, the Shandong Case Committee decided to use public debt and roadbed as collateral to Japan. After five years to fifteen years, 40 million would be used to redeem it from Japan. This year is the fourteenth year, and next year is the expiration date. It should be redeemed, so I have come forward to prepare for it. I am currently discussing the redemption funds with the railway and finance departments. Japan originally bought this road from Germany. Since the Shandong Conference to date, in the past thirteen years, it has earned a surplus of more than 20 million. The operating situation can be said to be not bad.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese War Imminent</p>
<p>The reporter then asked Wang about his observations on the Sino-Japanese pseudo "Man" Mongolian border dispute. Wang said that this area has become a point of contention between China and Japan, and it can even be said that it is where the Sino-Japanese War will break out. The pseudo-Mongolian border stretches for more than a thousand miles. Whoever occupies it will gain an advantage, naturally forming a must-contested area. At present, both sides have stationed heavy troops there, and the situation is very tense. A major war is very likely to break out.</p>
<p>Soviet-Mongolian Agreement to be Submitted to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Wang continued, "This decision by the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia to sign a mutual assistance agreement ignores our country's sovereignty. Our foreign affairs authorities are continuing to protest to the Soviet Union. Some advocate that our country can appeal to the League of Nations. In principle, this is not impossible. However, we are still protesting at the moment. If it is deemed necessary in the future, we can submit it to the League of Nations. The League of Nations is originally a peacemaker for all countries. When there are disputes, as a last resort, we can only appeal to the League of Nations. But whether the League of Nations is powerful is another question."</p>
<p>Wang Denies He Will Be Sent to Soviet Russia</p>
<p>It was previously rumored that Ambassador Yan Huiqing to the Soviet Union will return to China in the future. Because of his old age, he is not suitable for living in cold regions for a long time, and he intends to retire. Wang Zhengting will succeed him. The reporter specifically asked Wang about this. He replied, "I have not heard of this. I only know that Ambassador Yan will return to China because Foreign Minister Zhang is newly appointed and needs to be consulted or reported to. Therefore, he will definitely return to China."</p>
<h3 id="e84">Fudan President Li Summoned Students Yesterday for Admonishment <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that the seven students of Fudan University in Jiangwan who were arrested have been bailed out by Du Yuesheng and Qian Xin-zhi, members of the school board. The municipal authorities, in view of the fact that no further action should be taken after their release to prevent disputes, President Li Denghui of the school summoned some students for a talk at 2 p.m. yesterday, hoping that the students would continue to attend classes as usual and seek a solution.</p>
<p>Regulations of the Antiquities Preservation Association: Procedures for Exporting Antiquities: Shippers Must Apply for an Export Permit, and the Ministry of Finance Will Order the Customs to Inspect and Release</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Antique Industry Association stating that the Jianghai Customs Notice Department's order on restricting the export of antiquities did not have specific standards. It requested that the government authorities conduct a detailed review and formulate standards. After submitting the matter to the government, the Ministry of Finance issued an instruction stating: "The matter has been presented and referred to the Ministry of Interior for review and discussion, and then sent to the Ministry for compliance." Later, it was approved by the Ministry of Interior on March 23, Year 25, with the reply that when the Executive Yuan issued the aforementioned outline, it ordered the Central Antiquities Preservation Committee to formulate detailed rules and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. At present, these detailed rules have not yet been drafted, and the committee has been ordered to conduct detailed research and formulate standards for reply, so that they can be transferred and complied with. It has also been ordered to comply with the previous order of the Executive Yuan to quickly draft the aforementioned outline details and submit them to the Ministry for review, approval, and implementation. According to the committee's report on March 13, Year 25, it was submitted to the 12th Regular Meeting of the committee for detailed discussion. It was unanimously agreed that there are many types of antiquities in the country, which are too numerous to list. China is a country with 5,000 years of cultural development. All things left by our ancestors, such as broken bricks and short slips of bamboo, contain historical, scientific, or artistic value and are worth preserving. Therefore, it is necessary to examine the value of antiquities, regardless of whether they are works of art or modern products, and only after confirming that they meet the principles suitable for preservation should they be restricted from leaving the country to avoid loss. Moreover, China has a unique abundance of buried antiquities, which are often discovered. The art of imitation has gradually improved over the years. If antiquities leaving the country are not clearly identified one by one, there is a great concern that misrepresentation will increase and restrictions will become mere formalities. The outline of the scope and types of antiquities that the committee previously submitted for approval and promulgation was originally intended to be general in order to avoid omissions and prevent abuses. If specific standards are formulated only within the current scope of research, it will still be difficult to be comprehensive and applicable. As a result of the deliberation, it is proposed to waive the drafting. However, for the convenience of merchants, in the future, those who wish to transport antiquities from all over the country out of the country should first submit them to the committee for appraisal by experts or academic institutions before shipment and issue a certificate of permission to leave the country. At the same time, the committee will inform the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to inspect and release them so that both customs and merchants can slightly reduce difficulties in procedures. This will not lose the purpose of preservation while considering the business situation. As for the details of antiquities, the committee is inviting experts to study and draft them. In addition to waiting for the details and the rules for the implementation of the certificate of permission to leave the country, they will be submitted for review and promulgation separately. Before receiving the order, the reasons are presented in writing, and it is hoped that they will be reviewed and instructed, etc." Accordingly, the notification is hereby given for reference and compliance. This approval.</p>

<p>According to New News Agency, more than ten Qing Tiao Pi Si tobacco shops in the French Concession's New Kai He area, including Xinfutai, Yongshengrui, Xiehesheng, Yilinfeng, Sutai Xiang, Lindasen, Linsanhe, Gonghexiang, Sudekang, and Tongxingtai, were suddenly subjected to an additional "Categorized Business Hygiene Fee" of ten yuan per month by the French Concession Public Works Bureau's Donation Office, on top of the tobacco tax. This was deemed an unbearable burden. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the Taxpayers' Association to negotiate for its cancellation. After the association lodged a protest, a satisfactory resolution was reached. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Increased Tax Repercussions</p>
<p>The Qing Tiao Pi Si tobacco shops specialize in selling Lanzhou Qing Tiao and Fujian Pi Si tobacco. In the past, their business was quite good, with annual transactions exceeding one million. However, with the popularity of cigarettes, the industry has suffered a major blow, and sales have been declining daily. In addition to paying the tobacco tax to the French Public Works Bureau, there are no other taxes. Unexpectedly, last month, the French Public Works Bureau's Donation Office suddenly sent personnel to collect a "Categorized Business Hygiene Fee" of ten yuan per month, with penalties for violations. The businesses in the industry believed that with the current sluggish business, it would be impossible to bear the additional burden. They jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau to cancel this exorbitant tax, to alleviate the burden and benefit commerce.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, the association immediately sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the situation. They immediately sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau to express their opposition. Furthermore, the association's secretary, Zhang Shishi, met with Mr. Blandin, the acting director of the Public Works Bureau, and explained that these businesses only sell tobacco and do not sell other goods. The additional "Categorized Business Hygiene Fee" seemed unreasonable and unwarranted, and should be quickly cancelled to reduce the burden on merchants and residents and promote the restoration of prosperity within the concession. Mr. Blandin agreed to investigate and respond later.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Resolution</p>
<p>Mr. Blandin, the acting director of the French Public Works Bureau, replied to the Taxpayers' Association in a letter yesterday, stating, "Having read your letter of March 23, we understand the matter. On the 7th of this month, your association's secretary came to the bureau for discussion. It has been verified that ten Qing Tiao and water pipe tobacco shops, including Xinfutai, are still only required to pay the tobacco tax each month and do not need to pay for a categorized business license, as these shops only sell Qing Tiao and Pi Si tobacco used for water pipes. As for tobacco shops that retail tobacco used for cigarettes, they are not included in this exemption and are still required to pay ten yuan per month." After receiving the letter, the association immediately forwarded it to the respective shops for their information.</p>

<p>Mr. Tan Dingfen, who recently returned to China after completing his studies in Europe, went to the United States several years ago to study at the Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of Chicago, where he devoted himself to studying wireless electricity and gained considerable insights. Two years ago, he transferred to England and interned at the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. He recently returned to China due to personal matters and originally planned to go to France and Belgium for further studies. However, the government is recruiting talent for the telecommunications administration and has already appointed him, so his intention to go abroad has been cancelled. Mr. Tan suffered from a minor illness on his way back to China due to exhaustion. After arriving in Shanghai, he was admitted to the hospital for rest. After two weeks, he was discharged from the hospital and immediately went to Beijing. Before taking office, he also plans to visit various parts of the country to investigate the telecommunications administration. According to Mr. Tan, speaking to a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, he had invented a lightweight wireless electrical machine in England, based on his experience, that can simultaneously send and receive telegrams and broadcasts, making it ideal for use on ships and vehicles. He has already assembled one machine and will take it to Beijing for field testing. Mr. Tan has also written two books, "Experiments in Wireless Electricity" and "Internal Combustion Engines," which will be published soon and contain rich content.</p>
<h3 id="e87">All Sectors Respond to Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Celebration, Rice and Grain Industry Ningbo Association Resolves to Purchase One Aircraft Each <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Aviation Association's "Expanding Aviation to Save the Nation Movement" and the "Committee to Raise Funds for Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Celebration" began their work, people from all walks of life have been supporting and enthusiastically contributing to endorse the leader. Details have been reported in various newspapers. The association received a letter yesterday from Shi Meigang and Chuan Yougang at 711, Fourth Road, expressing their deep sympathy for the purchase of aircraft for birthday celebration. However, due to their weak financial situation, they could not contribute much, so they purchased five tickets of the 22nd National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery, No. 115815, hoping to win the first prize to purchase an aircraft to present. The association also received one national currency each from Chen Peide and Hangzhou Wang Jingxuan, who responded to the birthday celebration solicitation at 49 Pubofang. It is said that they have been accepted and thanked by letter.</p>
<p>The association is soliciting organizations, institutions, and individuals from all sectors of the city to serve as initiators for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebration. Various sectors have been quite enthusiastic in agreeing to join. It is now reported that the Shanghai Local Association, the Shanghai Education Bureau, the Architectural Society of China, the Rice Merchants' Association, and other groups, as well as leaders from all sectors, including Lu Wenshao, Xu Xiaochu, Yu Bao'e, Yang Linshu, Huang Zukang, and Wang Zhaoqi, have also agreed to participate and work together to complete the mission as soon as possible. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Rice and Grain Industry Association and the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, visited Li Dachao, the Director-General of the Fundraising Committee for Purchasing Aircraft for Birthday Celebration, yesterday to discuss raising funds for purchasing aircraft for birthday celebration. It was decided to undertake the purchase of one aircraft for the food and grain businesses, with a budget of 90,000 to 100,000 yuan, and to actively proceed with the project immediately. Yesterday, Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Ningbo Association, stated that the Ningbo Association had decided to undertake the fundraising for purchasing one aircraft, with an estimated cost of 100,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Navigation Industry Association decided at a meeting yesterday to send a special birthday greeting gift certificate of 1,000 yuan, which demonstrates the enthusiasm of all sectors in supporting the cause.</p>
<p>Also, according to news, the Chinese Aviation Association is actively promoting the expansion of aviation to save the nation and to respect and support the leader, and launched the initiative to purchase aircraft for birthday celebration. A person in charge of the association stated that this initiative is meant to expand the movement to save the nation through aviation, and to commemorate the anniversary of the Chairman's birthday. The name of the fundraising activity in Shanghai to purchase aircraft for birthday celebration is defined as "Chinese Aviation Association, Expanding Aviation to Save the Nation Movement, Shanghai Fundraising to Purchase Aircraft to Present to the Government, in Commemoration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th Birthday." According to a further report, Mr. Huang Jinrong sent Wang Wenkui and Chen Peide to the association yesterday to discuss fundraising for purchasing aircraft to present to the government in celebration of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. Huang Jinrong personally invited famous performers such as Li Shengzao, Zhao Xiaolan, and Yang Shengchun to perform in a charity performance tomorrow (the 13th) evening at the Huang Jin Grand Theater. All proceeds, as well as the wages of all actors and staff, will be donated to purchase aircraft for birthday celebration. The association has sent a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Nine Shipping Companies Seek to Salvage Far East-Europe Maritime Transport, British Ships Account for the Largest Share of the Pooling Ratio, American Ships the Least <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report by This Newspaper) The economic recession in recent years has shaken the entire world, especially in China, where the "September 18th" and "January 28th" incidents have led to commercial decline, rural bankruptcy, increased unemployment, and reduced industrial and commercial production, all reflecting the exhaustion of social finance and revealing the bottom layer of economic depression. This is truly the reality of China today amidst the global recession.</p>
<p>Shanghai is the leading commercial port in the Far East, the hub of China's land and water transportation, and the only large market for countries around the world to sell their goods. Counting ships from the East and West, at least four to five hundred ships arrive at Wusong and enter the Huangpu River each month, not including those sailing on inland waterways. The volume of foreign goods imported each year is imaginable. However, the value of imports has also decreased sharply in the past three years, especially last year and this year, when foreign imports plummeted. This year, China has surprisingly broken the record for trade surplus, something that has not been seen in over sixty years. Is this a good phenomenon? No, it reflects the lack of purchasing power in our country. The decrease in imports is truly due to the sluggish market.</p>
<p>The fact that China's exports can exceed imports is theoretically a good phenomenon, but a detailed examination of the customs report shows that the amount is still less than the amount during the months with an import surplus in previous years. The overall decline in imports has directly affected major shipping companies. In recent years, shipping companies operating on ocean and foreign routes, whether European or American, have been losing money in 99% of cases. If they can maintain expenses, it is already considered rare. Therefore, the Blue Star Line ships in the Far East were the first to suspend operations, and the E-Tai-Gelden Line, which had been operating for decades and had deep roots, was also merged into the Blue Funnel Line.</p>
<p>The overall decline in shipping has caused great alarm among European shipping merchants in the Far East. At first, they used competitive methods, such as secretly offering rebates, as conditions for carrying more goods. However, these actions were always irregular and disruptive, and China's exports were decreasing day by day. As a result, shipping merchants from England, France, Japan, the United States, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Denmark in Shanghai held discussions for a long time and finally agreed on a safe method to rescue Far East-Europe shipping: abolish the competitive practice of offering rebates and discounts, implement a "public dispatch" of goods based on a grand alliance, and have a public notary hired by all shipping merchants to handle the matter.</p>
<p>The volume of export goods from Shanghai to Europe has now decreased by two-thirds compared to before (mainly because soybeans and miscellaneous grains from the Northeast are no longer being shipped). According to current investigations, the total annual exports are at most between 110,000 and 160,000 tons. There are five British shipping companies, one French shipping company, two German shipping companies, one American shipping company, one Japanese shipping company, and one each from Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Italy competing for the shipping. The principle of pooling has shifted from "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality" to "no equality and no scarcity."</p>
<p>Pooling has long been established for foreign railways. All parallel lines have a pooling system. The six companies of the Yangtze River in our country also have a pooling system, but the method seems similar to and different from this European shipping pool. In the European pool, "Thomson &amp; Company", the agency in charge, first investigates and clarifies the total number of export goods from Shanghai (i.e., all of China) each month, and then statistically analyzes the ships and tonnage of the fourteen shipping companies. The amount of cargo loaded is then allocated using a percentage ratio. Once allocated, no more competition is allowed. Even for passenger loading, Thomson must be contacted first to obtain a pooling cargo certificate before reporting for shipment.</p>
<p>After detailed investigation by the reporter group, the pooling ratio of the fourteen shipping companies is listed below: British India Steam Navigation Company accounts for fourteen shares; Blue Funnel Line accounts for thirteen shares and four tenths; Nippon Yusen Kaisha accounts for twelve shares and twenty-five hundredths; American Mostyn Yanghang accounts for ten shares; Hempel Line accounts for nine shares and five tenths; French Post Office Steamship Company accounts for five shares and one tenth; Italian Post Office Company accounts for four shares and twenty-five hundredths; Netherlands Java Company (European class) accounts for five shares; Shunheng Yanghang accounts for five shares; Shilong Yanghang accounts for three shares and fifty hundredths; E-Tai (now E-He) accounts for four shares; Jardine Matheson (European class) accounts for two shares; Huichang Yanghang accounts for three shares; and Dalai Yanghang accounts for one share.</p>
<p>Pooling has now been implemented, and although there is less cargo, it is allocated evenly. From now on, the freight rate per ton can be maintained at a minimum of seventy-five shillings. Rebates are limited to 10%, but can only be settled after one or two months. Whether this method is convenient for loading is another question, but amidst this shipping recession, the European shipping industry has finally found a deep and solid solution. From now on, there will be no more favoring of some over others.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Zhejiang and Shanghai Purchase Foreign Rice, Jiangsu Chamber of Commerce Jointly Cables to Stop It <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to Shanghai Times News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce United Council telegraphed the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "According to a letter from the Wuxian Chamber of Commerce, a member of this council, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce is colluding with Shanghai merchants to request the Executive Yuan to issue free passports to purchase foreign rice, harming the country and its people, which is outrageous. Eastern Zhejiang had a great harvest last year, but the province's officials and merchants falsely claimed a poor harvest and, under the pretext of stabilizing rice prices, petitioned the government to issue tax-free passports for foreign rice to handle hundreds of thousands of bags of rice for sale in Shanghai. This year, farmers in both provinces are seeing a slight increase in rice prices, which can alleviate their hardship slightly. Unexpectedly, the province's officials and gentry have relapsed into their old ways and are again requesting tax-free passports, and Shanghai merchants are also being swayed, showing signs of following suit. If they are deceived and the request is approved, the reduction in national tax revenue is a minor matter, but the rural areas, which are already on the verge of bankruptcy, cannot withstand further destruction and pain. The matter is of great importance. We should telegraphically request the government to stop the transportation of foreign rice to relieve the people's livelihood," etc. Upon receiving the letter, the council investigated and found that the original purpose of transporting foreign rice to relieve famine was a necessary measure for Qin disasters and Jin rice sales. However, rural areas in Jiangsu still have 50-60% of rice in storage, and rice prices are currently rising slightly. If foreign rice is allowed to be dumped and deprives us of rice sales, rice prices will inevitably plummet to an irreparable level. This matter concerns the rural economy and cannot be ignored. We should truthfully submit this document and telegraphically request your review and approval to stop the transportation of foreign rice to relieve the people's livelihood," etc.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Silk and Satin Industry Association Asks the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to Arbitrate the Debt of Dashengfu <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Tianfu and Dashengfu, two silk and satin stores associated with the Quan Tuan [權團 - a business guild], have debtors who have not fully complied with the agreed-upon terms. Therefore, F康 [Fu Kang], 大豐 [Da Feng], 同章 [Tong Zhang], 雲章 [Yun Zhang], 協與 [Xie Yu], 麥成 [Mai Cheng], 麗華協 [Li Hua Xie], 鼎康 [Ding Kang], and sixty other silk stores have jointly sent a letter to the Silk and Satin Industry Association, requesting them to forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for arbitration. The letter reads: "Respectfully, after the bankruptcy of Tianfu Silk and Satin Store, the owed money to the staff and for goods amounts to more than 80,000 yuan. We should pursue Dashengfu, the associated store, for payment. However, the debtor, Wu Zhihao, who bears the same responsibility, has disappeared without a trace. The manager of the associated store initially completely denied any responsibility, attributing everything to Tianfu and refusing to deal with the matter. Subsequently, our members pursued legal action and the court ordered the inspection of the books. Wu Zhihao, realizing his position was untenable, then appointed Liang Shigui as his full representative to negotiate. After several rounds of discussions, he finally agreed to pay 35% of the total loan amount first, with the remaining balance to be paid after Dashengfu's autumn inventory, after repaying the loans with collateral, the remaining amount will be distributed among the members. A lawyer certified this agreement, and each party kept a copy for record. Later, the representative Liang sent Dashengfu's autumn inventory statement, which our members, after reviewing, found to be suspicious. We immediately sent representatives to inspect the store's books and found that there was a large amount of inventory that did not match the reported statement. We then appointed an accountant to re-examine the books, but the accountant found that the inventory listed in the books was mostly stamped with the words 'to be returned.' After the accountant studied the handwriting of the stamp, it seemed newly engraved and obviously not factual. When questioned, the person in charge of the store replied that the inventory had been returned to Tianfu. Upon investigation, Tianfu's goods were always collected by Dashengfu on its behalf. If suitable, Tianfu would issue a receipt. According to the person in charge of the store, if this were considered factual, then Dashengfu's goods would still rely on Tianfu. If unsuitable, they would be returned to Tianfu. Although separate in appearance, they are one in substance, indicating that they had a fraudulent intention from the start. Our members, unaware of their deceit, fell into a trap. We were in the process of legally pursuing them based on the agreement and the false accounts when Dashengfu suddenly announced liquidation, which halted our planned response. Now, the store is openly auctioning off its remaining goods, with large advertisements in major newspapers claiming to have over 500,000 yuan worth of inventory and a shocking promotion of selling two chi [尺 - a unit of measurement] of real silk spinning fabric for one fen [分 - a unit of currency]. We ask, is this inventory the remaining 65% owed to our members? And is selling two chi of silk fabric for one fen spending other people's money generously? This is obvious even to the unwise. However, one person opened two associated stores. When one store went bankrupt, the other store continued to operate calmly, without bearing the debt responsibility, and even selling off inventory at low prices, treating the creditors' capital like dirt. No one but a fool would willingly accept this. Therefore, at 7:00 PM on March 31st, we held a meeting of creditor representatives and invited Wu Zhihao to attend and report on how to resolve this case, in order to avoid accusations from all the creditors. Wu replied with a letter, still denying responsibility. Unexpectedly, the next day, the original site of the Dashengfu inventory auction officially opened as the 'Fuxing Guohuo Company' [復興國貨公司 - Revival National Products Company]. Interpreting the meaning of the word 'revival,' it is clearly Dashengfu's disguised resumption of business. Such rampant fraud is about to destroy commercial ethics completely. If not strictly suppressed, not only will the public anger of our members be difficult to quell, but also others who open associated stores may follow suit. The future of commerce is unimaginable. We have previously sent a letter to your association, requesting that it be forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for arbitration. Now, our members have suffered significant losses and are unwilling to accept this. Moreover, your association is promoting commercial ethics and strictly punishing industry outcasts. We dare to jointly write this letter again, hoping that your association will forward it to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, asking them to consider our commercial difficulties and promptly convene both parties for a fair arbitration based on reason. At the same time, we also request that you forward it to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, asking them to order a thorough investigation and strict suppression of such pests who destroy commercial ethics, in order to deter fraud and prevent others from following suit. We are deeply grateful." The association, after receiving the letter, has already forwarded it separately.</p>
<h3 id="e94">In the Gu Zhuxuan Bribery Case, Zhang Tinggui and Zhao Guangfu Were Interrogated Yesterday <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Testified About the Handover of the Bribe</p>
<p>Zhao Claimed His Mind Was Unclear</p>
<p>In the case of Gu Zhuxuan instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, he was detained by the Special Second Court and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Later, during Gu's appeal period, the case of him bribing prison guards Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui (also known as Xiao Sizi) and others to give false testimony to overturn the verdict was revealed. After a clear investigation by the prosecutor, Gu Zhuxuan, his brother Gu Songmao, prison warden Wu Lu, guard Ma Xianxiang, and fugitive prison guards Ma Xianxian, Ma Xiancai, and Wang Yushou were prosecuted by the Criminal Court of the same court for the crime of instigating perjury. After Judge Li Changnian once interrogated them, all the defendants vehemently denied the charges. The trial was suspended by order, pending further questioning and verification. This has been reported in previous newspapers. Now, the presiding judge, Li Changnian, deemed it necessary to interrogate the complainants in this case, Zhang Tinggui and Zhao Guangfu. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he and Prosecutor Wang Ren sat in the Second Criminal Court and first brought up Zhang Tinggui for questioning. Zhang testified that the warden Wang Yushou first said to him, "It's no use for you to accuse Boss Gu. If you want money, we can discuss it." Zhang replied, "We are in prison, what's the use of money?" Later, the guard Ma Xianxiang told him to retract his testimony, saying, "Everything has been taken care of elsewhere. It's useless for you to accuse him. You might as well take some money to use." Zhang asked how much money there was. Ma said 3,000 yuan, from which he would deduct 500 yuan as commission, leaving 2,500 yuan for Zhang. However, the money could not be given to Zhang temporarily and had to be deposited in a bank. Ma also said that Zhang's name could not be used and Ma would use a name on his behalf, Wang Chunhua. The official asked who deposited the money in the bank. Zhang replied that according to Ma Xianxiang, it was Gu San (Gu Songmao), Ma Xianxiang, and Zheng Jian three people who went to the Daya Bank to deposit the money. When Ma showed Zhang the bankbook, Zhang noticed that the account name on the book was Zhang Senyu. Zhang felt strange and asked why the account name changed from Wang Chunhua to Zhang Senyu. Ma said he had taken the wrong one, that the bankbook belonged to Zhao Guangfu, and then took out a bankbook with the account name Wang Chunhua from his pocket. At this point, Zhang managed to snatch the bankbook. Ma Xianxiang wanted to get the bankbook back, saying he would deposit it elsewhere. Zhang refused, and as a result, he asked fellow prisoner Cao Shida to keep it for him. Cao issued a receipt to Zhang (the receipt had already been submitted). At that time, Ma Xianxiang said to Zhang, "Just say in the appellate court that Zhao Guangfu asked me to testify." The official asked how Zhang testified in the appellate court. Zhang replied, "I said that Wang Jinkui, who is on the run, told me that the fourth boss asked him to do it, but I did not say Gu Si Laoban [顧四老闆 - Fourth Boss Gu]. I also said that Zhao Guangfu asked me to come out to testify." Zhang thought he would temporarily change his testimony in order to get the remaining money the next day. Unexpectedly, Ma and others abandoned their posts and fled with the money. The official asked what Zhang's initial testimony about Gu Zhuxuan was. Zhang replied that he had always testified that Gu Si Laoban instigated the crime. Only after obtaining the bankbook did he retract his testimony. He also asked if Warden Wu and Ma Xianxiang had spoken to him. Zhang replied no. At this point, Zhao Guangfu was brought to the court. The official asked if he had initially accused Gu Zhuxuan. Zhao replied yes. He also asked if his testimony had changed. Zhao replied that he could not remember clearly what he said during each interrogation. When asked if Gu Zhuxuan had instigated the killing of Tang Jiapeng, Zhao replied that he had never seen Gu Si Laoban. When asked if the guard Ma Xianxiang had given him a bankbook and asked him to retract his testimony, Zhao replied that there was no bankbook and he did not know Ma Xianxiang, only a guard named (Xiao Ma). When asked if Ma Xiancai and Wang Yushou had spoken to him, Zhao replied that he did not know these two people either. When asked if Gu Zhuxuan had sent anyone to persuade him to retract his testimony, Zhao replied that no one had spoken to him. He really wanted to borrow money from Gu Zhuxuan, but because Gu refused, he had this idea. Unexpectedly, he made a false thing true and was sentenced to 15 years. Later, he had a change of heart, so he explained in the appellate court that it was not him. The official asked why Zhao admitted that Ma Xianxiang asked him to retract his testimony during the prosecutor's investigation, but denied it today. Zhao replied that his mind was really unclear. The rest of his testimony remained evasive and cunning. Judge Li ordered that both prisoners be returned to prison to serve their sentences.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Female Thief Zhou Wangshi Confesses to Robbery and Murder Cases <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Case Is Very Complex</p>
<p>Nine Robbers and Another Woman</p>
<p>Thieves Zhou Yitong and others, gathered a gang of Jiangbei robbers, specializing in robbery and murder. The firearms they used for robbery were carried by Zhou's concubine Zhou Wangshi, in order to conceal them from the attention of detectives. Unexpectedly, in January of this year, she went out to engage in robbery again. She was still carrying two pistols and 30 bullets when she passed through the Gonghexin Road area. A police officer noticed her, suspicious of her behavior, and searched her, finding the above-mentioned pistols and bullets. After investigation by the detective team, she confessed that she was from Yancheng, living on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. On January 1st of this year, Zheng Xiaoshouzi took away two pistols and went with Li Yizhi, Wang Shaoqing, Xia San, etc. to Nanshi Dapu Bridge to shoot and kill Wu Fugui. On the 6th of the same month, Zheng Xiaoshouzi colluded with Yang Defu and others to rob a certain cigarette paper shop on Xinqiao Road. They also colluded with Xiao Mao, Xu Xueqing, etc. to rob Liu Fengqi's jewelry store on Haichang Road. On the 8th of the same month, Zheng Xiaoshouzi also colluded with her husband Zhou Yitong, Sun Jiaoyou, Zhang Bao, Wang Liangyu, Zhang Yihong, Xiao Kuzi, Xu Defu, Ni Xiaoyouhan, Xu Yaowu, Tian Guisai, etc. to rob Chen Shunxing Bamboo Shop on Fangxie Road of legal currency, clothing, etc. On the 11th of the same month, Zheng Xiaoshouzi went out to rob again, resulting in the woman being arrested. The detectives then arrested Zhou Yitong, Xu Heshun, Xia San, Sun Jiaoyou, Wang Xiaoqing, Zhang Bao, Li Yizhi, Wang Liangyu, Zhang Yihong, etc. one after another, and together with the woman, they were handed over to the local court. After verification by Prosecutor Xiao, one pistol with serial number 169 matched the gun used in the Wu Fugui case. Therefore, a public prosecution was initiated for robbery and murder. Yesterday, Judge Chen interrogated them for a long time. Due to the complexity of the case, he ordered them to be interrogated again later. The defendants were returned to prison.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Where Did the Head Come From in the Fields of Zhoujiaqiao, Huxi? <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Bloodstains Were Obvious, Indicating It Had Been Separated from the Body Not Long Ago</p>
<p>The Reason Was Traced and Sent for Examination to Determine the Time of Death</p>
<p>A strange head was found in the fields of Zhoujiaqiao, Huxi, yesterday. The local bailiff reported it to the Shanghai Local Court, which appointed Prosecutor Kong Xianglin and Medical Examiner Xuan Zhiming to conduct an on-site examination. The head was found to be in the form of a skull, making it impossible to distinguish gender or age. However, the skull's blood color had not faded, and there were still bloodstains at the neck. It was determined that the head had been separated from the body for a maximum of three or four days, and that the murderer had used artificial methods to scrape off the skin, flesh, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, etc. from the head, making it into a skull shape in order to conceal the official investigation. This shows careful planning. It is evident that a tragic case occurred. Because there were no clues at the time, it was learned from the investigation that when the head was discovered, a passerby saw it being thrown out from inside a wall and reported it to the police, who took the reporter to the police station for questioning. Therefore, the prosecutor, exercising his authority, began to question the reporter while sending the head to the Zhenru Forensic Examination Institute to determine the sex and the time of death in order to thoroughly investigate the matter.</p>
<p>It was also learned that a farmer in the area claimed that at 5:00 PM on the 9th of this month, while picking vegetables in the field, he suddenly saw a paper package thrown out from inside the wall of a house. He immediately went forward to open it and saw a human head without skin or flesh. He was shocked and had to report it to the police station in charge. The detective then went to investigate the house, but everyone in the house said they did not know anything.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Jiang Xingjie's Youngest Son Asks for the Partition of a Million Yuan Estate <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Account Books Were First Submitted for Inspection</p>
<p>The Hearing Was Postponed for Two Weeks</p>
<p>Jiang Xingjie, a wealthy merchant from Nanjing who lived in Shanghai, passed away on January 22nd of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], leaving behind a large estate. Jiang had four sons and six daughters, but all the assets were not divided, but was managed by Yang, Jiang's concubine. Now, his youngest son, Jiang Guopei, claims that his father's estate is estimated at 3 million yuan, and since he is now of age, he should be entitled to a portion according to the law. He therefore hired lawyer He Shimei to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against his mother Jiang Yang, and his brothers Jiang Guoyou and Jiang Guozhang, requesting a partition of the estate. He demanded that the 3 million yuan estate be divided into three parts, with himself receiving one-third, amounting to 1 million yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Peng Shi opened the Fourth Civil Court for the hearing. The defendants also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Wang Fuchang to defend them. They claimed that they had just been appointed and were not prepared. Moreover, the assets of Jiang Xingjie were not as much as the plaintiff claimed. Furthermore, Jiang Xingjie had made a will before his death, which clearly stated the assets. His six daughters were each given 10,000 yuan, relinquishing their right to inheritance. The plaintiff was not a son born in wedlock, but was recognized as a son in the will, so he has the right to receive a portion and should be given according to the will. However, the plaintiff's lawyer, He, claimed that the plaintiff had never seen the will and that the estimation of the assets must be based on the defendant's general accounting books. These books were kept at the residence at No. 1 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road. To avoid any changes, he requested that the defendant be ordered to submit the books to the court for sealing. The defendant's lawyers insisted that there was no concealment or alteration and that such a measure was unnecessary. The plaintiff's lawyer insisted on this request, leading to a long debate. Finally, it was decided that the defendant would submit the books to lawyer Wang's office on Monday, and lawyer He would jointly review and seal them. Judge Peng Shi then announced that the case would be postponed for two weeks for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Female Counterfeiter from Sichuan, Wang Lei Shi Suspected <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Fang Tianjiexuan Confessed in Sichuan</p>
<p>The Police Searched the House but Found Nothing</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank of China received a telegram from the Hongxian branch in Sichuan the night before, stating that they had detained a female counterfeiter who used Bank of China counterfeit currency. Her name was Fang Tianjiexuan and 990 yuan in counterfeit currency was found in her possession, each bill worth 5 yuan. She had been sent to the county for investigation and had confessed that she purchased the counterfeit currency from Wang Lei Shi, a 50-year-old Sichuan woman at No. 8 Sanqing Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, Shanghai. Therefore, the bank's deputy manager, accompanied by a representative lawyer, went to the French police to report the situation. The police chief verified the confession and ordered a detective to go to the address and arrest the woman, Wang Lei Shi. However, a search of her residence yielded nothing. Yesterday, Wang Lei Shi was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The police lawyer first explained the situation, stating that the police were prosecuting under Article 196 of the Criminal Law. The bank's representative lawyer then requested a postponement because the bank was currently closed for the holidays and did not understand the details. When questioned, Wang Lei Shi confessed that her husband, Wang Jizhi, had passed away eight years ago. She came to Shanghai last winter to collect debts and visit relatives. She had stayed at the Wuling Apartment and met a fellow Sichuan woman, Fang Tian, introduced by a fellow villager, Ou Huiyu. She had never sold counterfeit currency and requested a thorough investigation. The plaintiff's lawyer also requested a postponement in order to telegraph Sichuan to clarify the details before proceeding with the investigation. Judge Li Changnian ordered Wang Lei Shi to be returned to prison and postponed the hearing to the 18th.</p>

<p>Xue Jinzhai and Xue Chunrong Were Found Not Guilty and Released on Bail</p>
<p>Weng Kelong, the young owner of the Dehe Pawnshop on Qiwu Pu Road, was kidnapped on the morning of December 12th of last year at around 7:00 AM while riding in his private car to Donghai School on Liaoyang Road. He was kidnapped and hidden in the Shanghai Plantation Garden on Xiangyin Road, where a large ransom was demanded. His father, Weng Jingqing, sent people to the Xiaobai Ferry area in Pudong to negotiate several times and paid 9,500 yuan, with the promise that the hostage would be released in a remote area on Xinmin Road, Zhabei. However, he was not returned home and was still confined in a small room in the garden. On February 23rd, the Central and Western Detectives of the General Inspectorate solved the case, rescued Weng's child, and arrested accomplices Dong Xuezeng, Zhang Sheng, Dong Da, and others from Yancheng, who were sent to the First Special District Court. After interrogation and judgment, they were sentenced to nine years and six months imprisonment each. Subsequently, the Yulin Road Police Department arrested Tang Yaodong, the principal culprit in the case, as well as suspects Xiao Jun Da, a blind man, and Xue Jinqi and Xue Chunrong, a father and son. They were sent to the Third Criminal Court. The two Xues hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend them. It was ordered that the debate be concluded and await sentencing. Xue Jinqi and Xue Chunrong were each released on bail of 500 yuan. Yesterday, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the court and sentenced Tang Yaodong to life imprisonment. Zhao Junda, Xue Jinzhai, and Xue Chunrong were all found not guilty and released. The Municipal Council lawyer Zhang Shizhu requested that the two Xues remain on original bail during the appeal period, which was approved by the court.</p>

<p>Firefighters Bravely Rescued a Young Girl</p>
<p>The Chen Yongxing Noodle Shop at No. 246 Dajing Road, Xiaobeimen, Nanshi, was opened by Chen A'gen from Jiangyin. The attic upstairs was rented to Gu Qiaohe from Chongming. The front building was rented to Jiang Changlin from Huzhou and his wife, Shi. At around 11:40 AM yesterday, a fire broke out in the attic due to Gu's carelessness while cooking lunch, igniting the bedclothes. The flames spread rapidly and became uncontrollable. Soon, the entire room was red with flames, and the stairs were cut off. Jiang Changlin and his wife, as well as a friend, Yang Aqin, were unable to escape and jumped out of the window, injuring their waists, legs, and arms. Jiang's three-year-old child, Xiao Mao, was sleeping soundly when the fire broke out and was forgotten for a moment, resulting in severe burns and barely any breath left. Firefighters bravely rushed into the fire and managed to rescue him. Jiang and the other three were rushed to Renji Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The fire spread to the neighboring buildings, No. 248 Yudai Meat Shop and No. 244 Zhu Shunxing Tofu Shop, each consuming one floor. The fire brigade arrived with the pump car and worked hard to put out the fire, which was extinguished after 40 minutes. It was heard that Zhu Shunxing had fire insurance with the Ning Shao Insurance Company for 2,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e102">The Shanghai News Resolves to Actively Rectify the City Appearance at the New Life Movement Conference <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Calling for Charity Organizations to Discuss Relief for Beggars and Attention to Hygiene Facilities in Public Places</p>
<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association held its eleventh executive meeting at the Fenglin Bridge Municipal Party Headquarters conference room yesterday at 9:30 AM. Instructor Wu Tiecheng, executives Yu Hongjun, Cai Jinjun, Jiang Wen, Yang Hu, Zhang Shouyong, and Sui Jingshi were present. Hu Tianseng, Chen Cong, Wu Kecheng, Zhu Jiarang, and others were in attendance. Wu Tiecheng chaired and Hu Tianseng recorded. Chairman Wu Tiecheng first reported on the association's affairs, followed by resolutions on cases such as rectifying the city appearance and improving public health, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Banning Welcoming Gods and Temple Fairs</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters sent a letter stating that temple fairs and welcoming gods should be strictly prohibited. Resolution: (Merged into the third case for discussion.) Regarding our association holding Cleanliness Movement Week, a method has been drafted, and it is requested to be approved. Resolution: Passed. Executive Jiang Hao proposed three items regarding the method for banning welcoming gods and temple fairs. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting them to convene relevant parties to discuss the banning method in detail.</p>
<p>Actively Rectifying the City Appearance</p>
<p>Executive Cai Jinjun proposed: (1) Beggars are spread throughout the city, not only hindering the city appearance but also being a serious social problem. It is proposed to request the Municipal Government to provide relief to benefit the New Life Movement. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the Public Security Bureau requesting them to convene local charity organizations to find ways to provide relief. (2) Most lower and middle-class residences in the city do not have balconies or backyards, so residents often dry clothes in the street, which is most detrimental to the city appearance. However, it is difficult to prohibit this in the short term. It is proposed that from a fundamental perspective, the Public Works Bureau should not approve new building plans without balconies. From a symptomatic perspective, if it is not due to limited space and there is a possibility of installing balconies, the Public Works Bureau should investigate and encourage installation. Resolution: A letter will be sent to the Public Works Bureau for handling.</p>
<p>Attention to Public Health</p>
<p>(3) The sewers in the streets of the South City are often in disrepair, and some densely populated areas still lack sewer facilities, resulting in sewage filling the streets. This not only hinders the city appearance but also violates hygiene standards. It is requested that the Public Works Bureau actively investigate and repair this. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Public Works Bureau for handling.) (4) Since the city started using garbage cans, residents have generally found it convenient. However, the existing cans are mostly damaged, and many residents have not replaced them, often dumping garbage on the streets, which is very unsightly. It is proposed to request the Health Bureau to actively investigate and reorganize this. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Health Bureau and the Public Security Bureau for handling.) (5) Public toilets and urinals in the city are insufficient, and their facilities are mostly simple and crude. This not only hinders the city appearance but also harms public morals. It is proposed that the Health Bureau actively investigate and reorganize this. Protective walls must be installed on both sides of urinals in the street to emphasize public morals. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Health Bureau and the Public Security Bureau for handling.) (6) Disorderly posting of advertisements and slogans is most detrimental to the city appearance. However, except for the Pudong Branch's jurisdiction, most other areas in the city do not have enough advertisement posting locations. It seems necessary to investigate the needs and urgently add more to improve the city appearance. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Public Security Bureau.)</p>
<p>Improving Bathhouses and Teahouses</p>
<p>(7) Bathhouses in the city charge high fees, and the general poor cannot widely enjoy them. It is proposed to request the Municipal Government to establish public bathhouses or instruct bathhouses to reduce bathing fees to achieve universality and emphasize public hygiene. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Health Bureau and the Public Security Bureau, jointly convening bathhouse owners in the city to discuss reducing bathing fees and jointly establishing public bathhouses.) (8) Most teahouses, taverns, and bathhouse attendants in the city do not receive wages and rely on tips for income. They spare no effort to beg from customers, and some even extort money. This not only insults their personality but also fosters a bad and despicable social atmosphere. Three reform measures are proposed for resolution (attached measures): Request the Municipal Government to order the Public Security Bureau to instruct shop owners to determine the wages of attendants, and the walls of each room must have a solid slogan saying "No Tipping" signed "By the Owner." Stipulate penalties. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Social Affairs Bureau.)</p>
<p>Specifying the Work of Scavengers</p>
<p>(9) Scavengers in the city work too late, often not finishing until after 9:00 AM. Residents' chamber pots are lined up in front of their doors, which not only hinders the view but also violates hygiene standards. In addition to the Public Security Bureau urging residents not to place chamber pots outside their doors before the scavengers come and to bring them indoors after they are emptied, it is proposed that the Health Bureau specify the working hours of scavengers according to the seasons. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Health Bureau and the Public Security Bureau for handling.) (10) Please decide on the liaison method for the city's military police and New Life Movement to facilitate the work. Resolution: (A letter will be sent to the Garrison Headquarters to convene a meeting.) (11) The promotion of the New Life Movement in the city is complicated by the environment, and there are many things that need to be organized, which cannot be completed simultaneously. It is proposed to detail a plan for phased implementation to facilitate the work. Resolution: (Transferred to the association's design department for planning.) (12) Executive Zhang Shouyong proposed to investigate and do our best to eliminate accumulated habits in prisons and strive for cleanliness. Resolution: (Convene prison officials for discussion and invite the Public Security Bureau to participate.) The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e103">The Commercial Bank and Ningbo Money Shops Resolve the Issue of Using Secretly Marked Coupons <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Each Shop Also Sends a Letter to the Siming Bank Requesting Fulfillment of the Contract</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times News Agency reports that twenty-eight money shops, including Ningbo Baoda and Dakang, previously had a dispute with the Commercial Bank over the issue of obtaining secretly marked coupons. Now, Yu Zuoting, Wang Wenhan, and others have resolved the issue through consultations with Du Yuesheng, the chairman of the bank's board of directors. Yesterday, the twenty-eight money shops also sent a letter to the Siming Bank, requesting them to consider the contract and continue to pay interest as before. Details of each situation are noted below:</p>
<p>Commercial Solution</p>
<p>Twenty-eight money shops, including Ningbo Dakang, jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai headquarters of the Commercial Bank, stating that the Ningbo branch of the Commercial Bank canceled the agreement to receive secretly marked coupons without the consent of both parties. They requested the maintenance of the contract's credibility. They also sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, relayed to the Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association, Yu Zuoting of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Yu Qiaqing, and others, asking for their assistance. At the same time, they requested Wang Wenhan, the chairman of the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, to come to Shanghai to negotiate with the Commercial Bank headquarters. Now, Chairman Du Yuesheng of the bank and Wang Wenhan have reached a consensus. The Ningbo branch of the Commercial Bank will subsidize interest, from December 21, 1935, until the expiration of the contract, totaling 20,320.69 yuan. Both parties expressed their agreement and announced a solution.</p>
<p>Siming Negotiation</p>
<p>Also, the money shops in the area have not resolved the issue of obtaining secretly marked coupons from the Ningbo branch of the Siming Bank. Therefore, they jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai headquarters, requesting the maintenance of contractual obligations and the continuation of interest payments. The original letter stated: Respectfully, in the case of the coupon contract established between your bank and our shop, all clauses have been clearly determined and both parties have complied. Our shop has also worked hard to promote sales, even if it means subsidizing premiums. However, it concerns our vital interests, ensuring smooth circulation without assuming responsibility. We believe that this difficult situation will be clearly understood. Even though the Ministry of Finance has ordered centralized issuance, we have not heard any orders to stop the circulation of paper money. The matter is clear, so how can we take this opportunity to cancel the contract? Now that the Commercial Bank's coupon issue has been resolved, we believe that your bank will remember past efforts and continue to honor the original contract, including continuing to pay interest to relieve business difficulties and emphasize credibility. Correspondingly, we request that you investigate and reply.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Masts of the Jiang'an and Jiangxin Steamships Were Damaged by Lightning <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Both Will Be Repaired After Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Yangtze River transport ships, Jiang'an and Jiangxin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The masts of both ships were struck by lightning in Hankou at the same time. This matter is quite interesting. Our reporter went to the Jiang'an ship to meet Captain Chen and inquire about the truth. According to him, at 7:00 PM on the 8th, the ship was docked at the company's pier in Hankou. The crew members were having dinner in the cabin. There was a strong wind and heavy rain that day. Suddenly, there was a clap of thunder, and a flash of lightning struck the Jiang'an's rear mast. The ship shook as if it were about to capsize. The magnitude of the impact was immense. The metal on the pier clanged loudly, and pedestrians scattered. Fortunately, no one was on deck, and there were no accidents. Afterwards, an inspection revealed that the upper half of the mast had been struck in the center, as if split by a knife. After arriving in Shanghai, efforts will be made to repair it. Fortunately, there was a large iron ring on the mast, and the lightning stopped there, otherwise the deck would have been damaged as well. After striking the Jiang'an's mast, the lightning flew diagonally to the Jiangxin steamship (at that time, the Jiangxin and Jiang'an were docked at the same pier, bow to stern). Where the lightning struck, the outer layer of the Jiangxin's rear mast was also etched away, leaving only a wooden core. The etching of Jiangxin, which left only a wooden core, was the opposite of the Jiang'an's, which had its core removed. Truly a strange tale. No one on the Jiangxin was injured either. After arriving in Shanghai, the mast will also need to be repaired, he said.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Four People Died from Puffer Fish Poisoning <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Fan A'quan...Fan A'da...Pan Lansheng...Zhao Lao'er</p>
<p>Around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday, an unknown man and Fan A'quan (30 years old) and Fan A'da (40 years old) each rode three rickshaws to the Shanghai Sanatorium. The unknown man claimed to the hospital that the two Fans had been poisoned by eating puffer fish and requested treatment. He also said that he did not bring any money and would return home to fetch it. However, he never came back. The hospital then summoned an ambulance to transfer the two Fans to the Renji Hospital because the beds were full. The treatment was ineffective, and they died one after another. The Hongkou Police Station was notified and ordered Detective Shi Guichun to investigate. The two bodies were then taken to the Filon Road morgue for examination.</p>
<p>Also, Pan Lansheng, 49 years old, from Nanhui, Jiangsu, opened a butcher shop at No. 742 West Zha, Yinxiang Port. On the 9th of this month, Pan bought several puffer fish and brought them home. After cooking them, he and four members of his family used them as dishes for lunch. The family members only ate the fish meat and were fine afterwards. However, Pan ate all the fish organs, causing severe abdominal pain shortly afterwards. He was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The Yangshupu Police Station was notified and ordered detectives to investigate. Pan's body was also taken to the morgue. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Song Genshan from the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuji, arrived at the morgue. All three bodies were examined and determined to have died from puffer fish poisoning. After the two police stations reported the previous situation, Mr. Song instructed that the bodies of the two Fans be buried by the Pushan Villa, and Pan's body was given to his wife, Pan Zhang, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>
<p>Yesterday in the Gaolangqiao East Wangjiazhai thatched shed, Zhao Lao'er, 41 years old, from Tongzhou, picked up puffer fish eggs the day before yesterday afternoon and cooked them at home. He died of poisoning from the meal. Local guarantor Wang Dachang reported this to the local court, which dispatched Prosecutor Kong and others to examine the scene.</p>

<p>After going through liquidation due to the impact of the depression last year, all debts of the Nanjing Road Chinese-British Pharmacy were distributed at 7.5% by the Chamber of Commerce convening a creditors' meeting. The City Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting for April 25th to resolve the matter a second time. The pharmacy has decided to pay the second installment of the debt at that time. The notice from the City Chamber of Commerce reads: It is hereby scheduled to convene the second full creditors' meeting of the Chinese-British Pharmacy at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on April 25th. All creditors of the pharmacy are requested to bring their debt instruments and attend on time. In addition to separate notices, this notice is specially issued. The Chinese-British Pharmacy's notice reads: This pharmacy is scheduled to convene a creditors' meeting at the Shanghai City Council on April 25th of this year and will begin to repay the second installment of the debt of 7.5% after the meeting (i.e., the amount of the first resolution). At that time, creditors are requested to bring their debt instruments to attend and participate in the meeting at the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce and receive the money on the spot. Those in the silver money industry and the upper ranks who receive the money should each provide a receipt for the same amount as the first installment to facilitate record keeping.

<p>Bandit Drought for Seven Years...Bark Stripped...Extremely Heavy Disaster...Awaiting Relief with Utmost Urgency, Hundreds of Starving People...Women Sold in Human Markets...Soup Kitchens Maintain the Status Quo. Tang Zongguo, Director of Anhui Urgent Relief of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces, telegraphed the association yesterday: To Mr. Cheng Yiqing of the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Water Disasters in Various Provinces and all benefactors: Huoqiu and other counties have suffered from bandit droughts for seven years, and the reserves have been exhausted for a long time. The drought last year was particularly severe, with no harvest. Starving people are seen on the roads every day. The surviving people are thin and weak, as if about to fall in the wind. Those selling women, doors, windows, and furniture are seen on the roads. The bark of elm trees along the roads has been stripped bare. Where our colleagues inspected the disaster in person, more than 100 people starved to death in one district of Lianhua Temple, more than 70 people starved to death in one district of Changtang Shao, and more than 200 people starved to death or were sold in one district of He Kouji. There are human markets in Gaotang Town, Sanhejian, and other places, where women sit in rows for sale. The government strictly prohibits this, but cannot stop it. The tragic situation is unprecedented, except for the Shaanxi disaster in 1929. We will first allocate 20,000 yuan from the Relief Committee to Huoqiu for inspection and release to alleviate the urgent situation. However, it is a drop in the bucket and difficult to provide comprehensive relief. The wheat harvest will be more than two months away. Even if we provide one yuan per person, it is difficult to extend it until the wheat ripens. Those who do not receive relief are uncountable. The county officials and gentry in the city have set up a soup kitchen with a limit of 1,200 people receiving soup, which is quite effective. We are now planning to persuade them to set up soup kitchens in Wulong Temple, He Kouji, Sanliuji, Panji, and Yejiji to prolong their lives and supplement the inspections that have not been completed. We have allocated 5,000 yuan, but we do not know where it has been remitted. We will use this money to subsidize six soup kitchens in Huoqiu. Please instruct us to comply. The lottery ticket is worth 10,000 yuan. Please do your best to support it and make a decision on relieving Anhui as soon as possible, and ask the bank to borrow cash to facilitate inspection and release. Once we receive a definite indication, we will dispatch to Shouzhou and other counties for inspection and release. Mr. Li Tianzhen has gone to Hefei for inspection and release. Please keep this in mind. Guo is currently in the Corruption Property Committee and hereby reports. Tang Zongguo bows and sings.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Sauce and Wine Industry Rectifies Industry Rules and Fines are Donated to Aviation for National Salvation <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The products sold in the sauce and wine industry are essential for people's daily life. Therefore, the industry's shops are located throughout the streets and alleys. Five years ago, statistics showed that there were more than 2,500 shops in the city. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn and the infighting among the industry, those with weak capital have been squeezed out. Currently, there are only more than 2,000 shops left in the city, and only a few can make a profit at the end of the year. Zhang Dalian and Han Xingwei, members of the Shanghai Sauce and Wine Industry Association, in view of this, publicly formulated industry rules in 1933. In June of the same year, they were approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for implementation, and earnestly rectified the industry. However, over time, people became lazy, and a few industry members still disobeyed in secret. The association convened a general meeting of members in February of this year, and after strict discussion, decided to implement the industry rules, dividing the city into five districts, each district divided into several groups, and elected group leaders. The group leaders mutually elected district leaders. The association hired Liu Dingji as the general director, and negotiated with the Aviation Association for approval. If anyone deliberately violates the industry rules, the penalties will be determined according to the industry rules and sent to the Aviation Association, which will then request the Public Security Bureau to enforce them, and the money will be donated to the Aviation for National Salvation. The industry rules state that all industry members should join the association. The concession is also preparing a proper solution. The South District will start investigating on April 1st and gradually extend to other districts. It is believed that the sauce and wine industry will be rectified. It is also heard that the association's market quotation sheets are difficult to distribute due to the large area of the city. It has now negotiated with various newspapers to add sauce and wine industry market quotations in the economic news.</p>

<p>Raising a Son in the Flying Snow on New Year's Eve. Nothing Happened After Meeting at the Dance Hall</p>
<p>Luo Sen, 29 years old, from Siyang, owner of the Sen Sen Chemical Glass Factory at No. 17 Tailai Lane, Maigen Road, previously cohabited with Wang Qinhua (21 years old), a woman from Changzhou, in the Ruihua Rice Cake Shop in Baoxing Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei. Last New Year's Eve, she gave birth to a son. Because it was snowing heavily at that time, he was named Xuesheng. At that time, Luo paid Wang 150 yuan per month for living expenses. Now that Luo has a new love, he abandoned Wang, causing Wang to hire lawyers Ling Qihong and Liu Liang to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court based on Article 229 and Article 294 of the Criminal Law, which pertain to offenses against morality. Luo Sen, on the other hand, claimed that Wang was a dancer in the former Liangyou Dance Hall and that they met through dancing. He admits that Wang's allegations are true. Yesterday morning, Feng Shide, the chief judge of the criminal court of the First Special District Court, summoned Luo Sen and his lawyer to court. After Feng inquired about his age and origin, he announced that the hearing was adjourned because the case concerned morality and bystanders were prohibited.</p>

<p>Shi Jimin, 23 years old, from Nanjing, and Shen Deming, 22 years old, live near Singapore Road in West Shanghai, but they are not acquainted. Shi Jimin likes to flirt and had an affair with Da Genzi, a woman from the Yunji Barber Shop at No. 584 Xiaoshadu Road. Unexpectedly, Shen Deming is also an idler who wanders around all day. He accidentally saw Shi's lover and was struck by her beauty. The woman is also fickle, and they flirted with each other. Soon, Shen was also able to become a guest in her boudoir. However, the affair was not secret and was discovered by Shi. Therefore, Shi ambushed near the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Singapore Road yesterday afternoon. When Shen Deming passed by, he confronted him. The two sides disagreed and started fighting. However, Shen was no match for Shi. His head was beaten and he suffered the most serious injuries, collapsing on the side of the road. Shi's face was also scratched a little by Shen's fingers. The incident was noticed by a police officer, who rushed to the scene and took both parties to the police station for investigation.

<p>Wang Pan, a young widow living in Jingxing Lane, No. 2 Aiwunyi Road in the British Concession, is in her thirties and has some wealth. She has been a widow for six years and hires Xu Zhao from Yangzhou as a servant. Yan Zhaoying (living at No. 58 Chuaxinhe Bridge), who has known her for a long time, coveted her. At noon on the 9th of this month, he suddenly went to Wang Pan's house, falsely claiming that he had a quarrel with his wife and wanted Wang Pan to go and mediate. She was unaware of his plan and went with him. Unexpectedly, Yan Zhaoying led her to the Anle Inn on Sanyangjing Bridge, where he closed the door and used coercive and violent means to attempt to rape her. She resisted desperately and escaped. After returning home, she tried to commit suicide but was dissuaded by the servant and roommate. However, she was unwilling to submit. The day before yesterday morning, she took her servant to the city and turned Yan Zhaoying over to the Lao Beimen Police Station for investigation. After interrogation, there was no corroborating evidence, and the case occurred in the French Concession. She was instructed to file a lawsuit with the French Concession Court.</p>

<p>Li Zhang is Weak-Willed, What is Wu Zhenlong's Intention?</p>
<p>Li Chaofeng, 22 years old, from Hebei, was a police officer in Beiping and was very capable. Therefore, he was highly valued by the Beiping police chief. After the January 28th Incident, the city made great efforts to reorganize the police force and transferred capable police officers from Beiping and Tianjin to Shanghai. Li was one of them and was assigned to the Linping Road Police Station of the North Station Branch. In November of last year, Li, through the mediation of Wu Zhenlong (41 years old), a carpenter from Nantong who lives at No. 51 Yuhua Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei, married Zhang, a woman from Changzhou. After the marriage, the relationship between the couple was harmonious and they enjoyed each other's company. A month ago, Li received an order to go to the First Phase Police Concentration Training Team for training. When Li returned home after completing the training, he suddenly learned that Zhang had disappeared. He immediately searched everywhere but found no clues. It was not until about 10:00 AM yesterday that he found her at the home of the matchmaker, Wu Zhenlong. Li believed that Wu was suspected of abducting and concealing her. He immediately twisted him into the police station. After the police station briefly interrogated them, the case involved allegations of abducting and concealing a woman, which was a criminal case. Therefore, they prepared a document and sent all three defendants to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Lu Ronghua, who had accumulated thefts, stole property in Pingmin Village, Pushan Road, Zhabei, around 8:00 PM on the 1st of this month. He was arrested by Wang Zufufu, the director of Pingmin Village Housing Management, and sent to the Tanmiaoqiao Police Station for interrogation. The thief took advantage of the inattentiveness of the guarding police officer, Song Jinghui, and escaped without a trace. Later, the Xinzha Branch sent police officer Song to the Public Security Bureau for punishment. He has not been released yet. A few days later, Detective Sun Youzhi of the Xinzha Detective Team suddenly received a tip that the escaped thief Lu Ronghua and others were hiding at No. 19 Guoqing Road and so on. Detective Sun immediately reported to the chief and deputy captains and dispatched squad leader Li Shouchang, leading the original detectives Sun Youzhi, Zhong Yun, Zhang Shuwen, Xiao Huaiyu, and others to go there. They separately captured Lu and his accomplice Zhang Gaojin (also known as Xiao Ningbo) and copied out stolen goods and weapons. After being brought back to the team, the two thieves confessed that in addition to stealing property from Pingmin Village, Pushan Road on the evening of the 1st of this month, they had previously committed many crimes at No. 38 Chongde Lane, Hengfeng Road and other places in the Chinese Concession. After the team verified the confession, they transferred the thieves Lu Ronghua (aka Jin Sheng), 27 years old, from Ningbo, Zhang Gaojin (aka Xiao Ningbo), 24 years old, also from Ningbo, together with the stolen goods and weapons to the Xinzha Branch and then to the Public Security Bureau for distribution yesterday.</p>

At about 3:20 PM yesterday, a fire broke out in the factory's drying room, ignited by the flammability of the cloth. The fire blazed up instantly, piercing through the roof and threatening to spread widely. Fortunately, various fire brigades rushed to the scene with water pumps and extinguished the fire after some time. It is estimated that two bungalows and cloth were destroyed by the fire, resulting in losses exceeding a thousand gold pieces. The factory's accountant, Zhang Ruyuan from Taixing (35 years old, residing at No. 66 Sanyang Road), was arrested by the police dispatched from the West Baoxing Road Police Station and taken to the North Station Branch Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Huining Fellow Townsmen Association's Dispute Over Commercial Rights Regarding the Wutun Road Route <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Huining Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai researched the dispute over the northeastern and southwestern routes of the Wutun Highway. A telegram was sent to Director Liu of the Anhui Construction Department, Commissioner Shi of Xiuning, and County Magistrate Chen of Wuyuan. The original telegram stated: "Since the proposal to build the Tunwu Highway, both Wuxiu counties have sent personnel to survey and actively proceed. This is good news. However, recently, people from the two counties have been mutually contesting the northeastern and southwestern routes, each sticking to their own opinion and unable to reach a decision. Our association believes that this issue is greatly related to the prosperity of the entire Huizhou and the development of transportation. Furthermore, it is important for the convenience of suppressing remnant bandits. The matter is important and should not be viewed from only one perspective. We should weigh the pros and cons fairly and discuss it calmly, so that it can be completed as soon as possible. We have consulted familiar fellow townsmen regarding the terrain of Wuxiu and the essential points of commercial transportation, and considered them to serve as an accurate balance. However, according to the majority of opinions, Wuyuan's massive production of tea and various goods has always been concentrated in Jiangwan, exported via Longwan in Xiunan. Other goods such as salt and kerosene are also imported via Longwan to reach the entire Wuyuan. Carrying goods on shoulders and backs fills the roads. Taking the highway through Wudong, via Longwan in Xiunan to Tunxi, would not only be convenient for travelers, but also greatly facilitate commercial transportation. Furthermore, from the perspective of suppressing remnant bandits, the majority advocate using the eastern route. If one takes the western route through the Qinhua Boundary and Jieshou in Beixiang to connect with the Tunjing Road Post, it is not only inconsistent in name but also seems far-fetched. To make a fair judgment, the eastern route is still preferable. In conclusion, for the sake of both counties' transportation interests, it is best to adopt the majority's opinion as the decision. Be impartial and let it be completed as soon as possible. Do not obstruct the progress of the road due to disputes over route benefits. Therefore, we earnestly request that Your Excellency accept the majority's public opinion, consider the overall situation, and resolutely decide to order the engineers to conduct surveys and construction to benefit the transportation of both counties and create benefits for the local area. We await your orders anxiously. The Huining Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai bows."</p>

<p>Respected Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper's local news column about a bloody fight at the Dalu Ballroom, the facts are completely inaccurate. Although there was a dispute between dancers at our ballroom last night, it was quickly resolved. Furthermore, our ballroom's patrons are all upper-class guests, and our staff members treat customers with utmost sincerity. There is no way we would collude with gangsters. This is clearly based on misinformation. We are afraid that outsiders do not know the truth. Therefore, we are writing to request an immediate correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dalu Ballroom</p>
<p>April 11th</p>
<p>Regarding the news item on page 9 of the third edition of your newspaper on the 2nd of this month about the resignation of Lu Weipu, director of the Central Machinery Factory of the Ministry of Industry, which stated that the main reason for his resignation was due to our association's satire, this statement is completely untrue. We hereby issue a special letter to clarify this matter. We hope that your newspaper will make the necessary correction to avoid confusing the public.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Shen told reporters at Tsinghua University that the football team has decided to select 22 players. After the selection, they will go to Shanghai for training on the 23rd of this month. On the 2nd of next month, the football team will embark on a journey to Southeast Asia, competing in over 20 matches. After the matches, they will not return to China but will go to London, England, to board a ship with the Chinese delegation to the World Games and travel to Germany to attend the World Games. Yang Xiuqiong and Guo Zhenheng are considered to be promising swimming athletes. The performance of the other two is still under detailed review. The list will be announced in early June. The track and field association has been entrusted to select one representative for the walking race in Shanghai. Due to budget constraints, it is difficult to accommodate the request to send one more person. Yan Chengkun has been appointed as the football coach. Boxing athletes have been training in Shanghai recently with excellent results. The training steps are progressing from basic methods. This month, there will be a friendly match with Westerners in Shanghai. Germany's preparations for the Games have been exceptionally active recently. The rumors of postponement are likely speculations. The summer training courses and discussions will not be held this year. These three events were originally supposed to be organized by the Ministry of Education. The Standing Committee will convene again this month to discuss various methods for participating in the World Games, methods for centralized training of athletes, and other issues that need to be decided for the trip. A full board meeting may not be held again. If necessary, the third full board meeting will be held in Shanghai before the athletes leave the country. In addition to the 20 members of the association and the Ministry of Education who will go to Germany to observe sports, there may be several people who will travel at their own expense to visit with the delegation, but they must also have the appropriate qualifications.</p>

<h3 id="e127">National Martial Arts Southern Expedition Results <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Experienced 32 Matches in Singapore, the Philippines, and Hong Kong</p>
<p>The Southern Seas Touring Troupe, which returned to the country with honor the day before yesterday, was composed of the martial arts team from the Central National Martial Arts Academy and the basketball team from the National College of Physical Education. Wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by the local people. The martial arts performance has awakened the attention and recognition of the overseas Chinese there. The basketball team has fought in 32 matches in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Hong Kong, winning 30 matches. Their ball skills have improved significantly, and they have won glory overseas. According to Tang Baokun of the team, the team first went to Singapore and fought for six consecutive days starting on February 1st. The opponent with stronger strength was the Singapore United Team. They fought 18 matches in Jipolong, Jinbao, Yibao, Taiping, Penang, and all won. The above-mentioned places have only started promoting basketball in recent years, so the skills of each team are mediocre and the venues are also poor. The team then went to the Philippines, where basketball has a strong foundation. The Far Eastern Championship has been seized by the island many times. The individual performance of the players on the island is better than our team. However, in terms of cooperation, it does not seem to be as coordinated as our team. The key to victory or defeat is based on this. They fought in eight matches in the Philippines, losing only twice. The San Beda University, the All-Philippines Basketball Championship team, did not get a chance to compete with them, resulting in the loss of viewing opportunities. In the game against the YCO team, the team gathered the elite of the Philippines and prepared very thoroughly in advance. Our team was also defeated by two points. (In this game, the San Beda team was awarded 18 free throws, and our team only had 7 free throws). As for the game against the Letran team, the coach of the two teams was amazed at our team's achievements and expressed admiration. When returning to the country via Hong Kong, they fought four matches against South China and others. South China's movements were agile, no different from the Philippine team. It is heard that American coaches have been hired for instruction. In the future, the strong basketball team in our country should be in South China. However, the actions of the Hong Kong team members were sometimes rude, and the venue was poor. The people of Hong Kong's interest in basketball is not as strong as in football. In total, the team has played 32 games since its expedition, and the results are still satisfactory. The full results are as follows:</p>

<p>Lin Jing scored three goals, Wen Kui scored two goals, Poseley and Xing Fuen each scored one goal. The competition between the two sides was fierce. When the score was 4:00 PM, Poseley was kicked in the shin by a British soldier, almost leading to a fight. The left back of the Military United team, Mataier, was seriously injured. In less than ten minutes of the second half, it was completely a brawl. The Military United team responded with ten men, and their actions became even more brutal.</p>
<p>The First Half was 2-2</p>
<p>Five minutes after the start of the game, the defender of the Military United team committed a penalty of 12 yards. Lin Jing took the penalty kick and scored. After 15 minutes, Wen Kui received a corner kick and swept it in. Shanghai won two goals, and the momentum was strong. Then, the defense was empty, and the right forward of the Military United team scored one goal. Soon, Wen Kui scored one goal in the midst of the chaos. The Military United team counterattacked and kicked in two goals, creating a tie in the first half.</p>
<p>Grand Victory with 7-4</p>
<p>Not long after the start of the second half, the Military United team passed effectively and scored one goal, and the momentum increased. Lin Jing received assistance from Poseley and headed in one goal, creating another tie. Soon, the five forwards of the Shanghai team connected and attacked in front of the goal, and Poseley poked in one goal. Lin Jing rushed past the defender and shot in one goal. Finally, the Shanghai midfielder shot a long shot, and the ball landed 15 yards from the enemy's goal. The goalkeeper of the Military United team ran out to catch the ball, and Fu En rushed up and kicked it hard, and the ball flew into the net. Afterwards, they held each other to the end, and nothing was achieved.</p>

<p>Now, the baseball movement is booming in late spring, just as it should be. It is known that the company will continue to host the second Junior Baseball League. In addition to inviting the four teams that joined last year, it will begin recruiting immediately and solicit other strong teams to join to add interest. It is scheduled to begin competition in mid-May. Those who wish to participate can contact the Huadong Company on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>

However, the results were not able to be compared because the results of each district were excellent. This year, it was decided to follow the educational administrative district regulations and hold preliminary meetings by district first (the educational administrative districts total 22 districts, but it was decided that the downtown area and Yinhang district will be held jointly, Yinxiang district and Jiangwan district will be held jointly, and Luru district and Pengpu district will be held jointly, for a total of 19 districts). Each district will hold a preliminary selection in advance to select representatives, and then attend the city-wide joint sports meet. It is heard that the date of the joint sports meet has been set for May 14-16 and will be held at the municipal sports field in the city center for three consecutive days. According to the examples of previous sessions, it will be divided into male and female groups A, B, and C. Weight will be measured according to the regulations of the previous session, but the maximum weight of group A must not exceed 105 pounds.

<p>Fourth, Summary of Implementation Methods</p>
<p>Work Items:</p>
<p>1. Regular classes; 2. Morning exercises; 3. Extracurricular sports; 4. Organization of various extracurricular activities: (A) Intra-school competitions; (B) Inter-school competitions; (C) Excursions and trips; (D) Various designs and performances.</p>
<p>Key Teaching Points</p>
<p>Regarding senior high school physical education teaching methods, in addition to the principles of junior high school, attention should be paid to leadership training to prepare students to lead social sports after leaving school. The key teaching points are listed below: 1. Apply as much as possible the complete learning method and analytical learning method of ordinary teaching methods, as well as the law of readiness, law of exercise, and law of effect of educational psychology.</p>
<p>2. Regular classes, morning exercises, and extracurricular sports should be interconnected to avoid repetition and student boredom. (A) Regular classes should focus on basic training and the teaching of methods and rules for each sport. The teacher's work is heavier. (B) Extracurricular sports should focus on students' actual practice. At this time, the teacher is only responsible for management. (C) Morning exercises or recess activities should focus on gentle physical activity, and their function is to regulate life, with natural activities as the main focus. 3. Adopt group competition methods as much as possible, pay attention to universal sports, and avoid the competition system of a few athletes. 4. Hold skill tests at least once per semester. At the beginning of the semester, announce the test methods in advance to encourage students to work hard in practice. 5. Traditional Chinese martial arts should focus on application. 6. Schools without indoor sports facilities should make full use of ordinary indoor facilities for special sports activities. 7. Sanitary facilities, such as bathrooms, should be fully equipped. 8. According to the environment of each school, formulate various standards for skills, health, and common sense. 9. Use holidays to create large group sports design activities, such as celebrations and joint sports meets. 10. Unite with other groups in sports to compare and promote progress. 11. Conduct health checks of all students within three weeks after the start of each school year. 12. Adopt ability grouping methods as much as possible. Physical education grading cannot be based on general intelligence. Because students of different regions are of different ages and have different degrees of physical development, students of the same grade may not be suitable for the same type of teaching materials. Therefore, ability grouping should be adopted as much as possible within the scope of possibility. In addition to the grade level, the following five types should be used as standards (see appendix). 13. Gymnastics (using basic movements of ball sports, track and field, and apparatus exercises for analytical practice as preparation for various sports).</p>
<p>Appendix: Grading Methods</p>
<p>In addition to the original grade division method, divide into the following five types: 1. Gender; 2. Results of physical examination; 3. Age, height, and weight; 4. Physical fitness; 5. Skills. The five types of grading methods are briefly explained below: 1. Gender: After the age of twelve or thirteen, boys and girls develop differently and have different interests. Therefore, physical education in ordinary senior high schools should be taught in completely separate classes. 2. Results of health examination: Health examination is one of the most important events in school administration. At least one examination should be conducted for each student every year. The results of the examination should be used as a reference for physical education grading. Students with poor physical development or defects should be given special instruction. 3. Age, height, and weight: Students of different ages and with different development are difficult to teach together in physical education classes. Many schools use age, height, and weight for grading, some use only one type, some use two types in combination, and some use three types in combination, with the combination of three being the best. McCloy's athletic skills standard score table can be used for application. A simple method is listed below for application and can still be changed during use. As shown in the table, it is divided into seven levels. During application, the index obtained by senior high school students can be divided into two or three levels according to the actual situation.</p>

The fees to be raised by each county and city should be notified to each province and city to instruct each county and city to include the newly added free education fees in the 25th year budget and detail the funding methods. (B) Regarding free education administration: Each local book should be divided into elementary school districts and uniformly divided within this year. Each district should have at least one short-term elementary school, and its funding should be based on self-raising by each joint guarantee or elementary school district. Poor districts may be subsidized by the central government and provinces. Each district should immediately establish a school board to handle district affairs, and the county magistrate should formulate reward and punishment measures for the school board and implement them at the end of each year. The ministry will formulate reward and punishment measures for county magistrates for handling free education, and at the end of this year, each education department will assess and report to the ministry, and submit it to the Executive Yuan for rewards and punishments respectively, and implement the resolution within this year. The above four proposals were passed. The responsible officials who have effectively implemented free education this year will be submitted by the ministry to the Executive Yuan for rewards at the end of the year. (C) Regarding free education teachers: Educational administrative personnel in each county and city should be centrally trained by the central government in batches. The country will be divided into several inspection areas, with inspections assigned by the ministry and provincial inspectors. Provincial inspectors should live in the designated area. Starting from the 25th year, the central government will concentrate on training rural normal school principals, 500 to 600 people each year, with a period of one year. Starting from the 26th year, rural teachers will be established in each county, aiming to achieve at least one rural teacher in each county within three years. Resolutions: The above proposals were passed in principle, and the ministry will detail the training methods, as well as the ministry inspector and provincial inspector's district inspection methods.</p>

<p>The Finale of the 40th Anniversary Celebration of Jiaotong University: President Li Speaks on the Next 40 Years</p>
<p>The 40th anniversary celebration ceremony of Jiaotong University was completed yesterday and classes have already begun the day before yesterday. At 7 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 10th), the Science Society, Management Society, and Engineering Society organized by the students of the school invited Zhu Kezhen to speak on National Rejuvenation and History, Mao Yisheng to speak on Bridge Engineering, and Chen Bozhuang to speak on How to Develop Freight Transportation. All gave thorough explanations, and many people listened. At 7 p.m. yesterday (the 11th), the school's student union held a dinner in Wenzhi Hall, with more than 200 attendees. The scene was unprecedented. During the dinner, the president of the union, Zhang Gongjiu, the former supervisor of the school, Fu Kaicheng, and other alumni gave speeches successively. President Li also reported and dispersed happily. After President Li's report, he also gave a speech on "The Next Forty Years," generally meaning that it is better to look forward than to look back. How Jiaotong University will move forward depends on whether the environment changes. Not only should we seek progress in a favorable environment, but we should also promote it in an adverse environment. The so-called environment includes natural and man-made environments, and the latter can be divided into hereditary and current environments. Both of these have world or international and national or local aspects. In the future, whether our country's environment is natural or man-made, in the next forty years, it will change more and faster than in the past forty years. The biggest problem of change is considered by modern people to be world war and peace, and its advantages and disadvantages to our country are unpredictable. Even if it can be predicted, it cannot be determined. For the sake of national security, we should seek more welfare for mankind. For the sake of mankind's welfare, we should seek the invention of invention and the creation of creation. How will the changes or advances and retreats in the next forty years affect our school? It is worth thinking deeply about and planning for a long time. I believe that the gains and losses of our school in the next forty years depend on how we work hard. The following four major issues must not be ignored: How can we make the talents we create meet the needs, so that the name and reality can be consistent? How can we make the prepared personnel transform the environment, so that groups and individuals can coexist? Can we feel the expectations of society and can we promote our responsibilities? Can we value the honor of alumni and can we take on our responsibilities?</p>
<h3 id="e142">Ten Important Aspects of Vocational Supplementary Education (Part 3) <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Wenyu</p>
<p>(9)</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the general workers. We can never say that most workers don't have outstanding geniuses, because there are too many people, so there must be special people. These special geniuses are already very wronged because they have no ability to go to school. If there is no opportunity for supplementary education for them, isn't that even more unfair to them? I am very confident that if there are vocational supplementary schools at all levels to provide them with training, a part of these special geniuses will definitely be able to show themselves, stand out, and become great talents. Unfortunately, a group of old-fashioned agricultural, industrial, and commercial circles have buried many geniuses because they have no supplementary education. This is really very important. This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of special geniuses.</p>
<p>(10)</p>
<p>There is one more point that I want to add. All undertakings in the world should be valued for their economy. If you can use less cost and have greater effectiveness, then the value of success is relatively high. Ordinary education requires building school buildings, purchasing instruments, buying specimens, and various equipment, which costs a lot. As a result, a lot of material resources are consumed, and the actual results may not be as expected. Moreover, in terms of equipment, it may not be fully utilized. This is so regrettable. If vocational supplementary schools can borrow existing school buildings and existing instruments and specimens without additional equipment, and the educational goals have been achieved, it would be much more convenient to set up supplementary schools in farms and factories. Then, since there are formal schools and other farms and factories that can be used, why not do it? Moreover, this method is beneficial to all parties. Schools, farms, and factories can get a lot of help with supplementary schools, and supplementary schools can be set up in many places without additional equipment. Isn't this very economical? Moreover, I hope that in the future, vocational supplementary schools can be set up in all public places. This is seeing the importance of vocational supplementary education from the perspective of convenience and economic effectiveness.</p>
<p>Now that vocational supplementary education has these ten important aspects, shouldn't we greatly promote it, greatly advocate it, and greatly popularize it? (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e143">Finance: Long-Term Transactions Opened in Various Industries Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, long-term transactions were opened in the money houses, with more than 200,000 yuan made by foreign firms, sugar firms, Jianchao pawnshops, and others. The interest rates were 8.75 yuan for Jianbang, 9.25 yuan for pawnshops, and 9 yuan for other miscellaneous gangs. As for maturing loans, this decision will have to wait until the 15th before they can be summarized, so the current situation is still quiet and silent. For tea and cocoon uses, tea merchants loaded more than 100,000 yuan of silver dollars yesterday. There is no news about cocoon loan uses.</p>

<p>Yesterday was still during the customs closure. There was no news from the banks. Although the money houses were operating as usual, there were still few ins and outs. Bank transfers were not possible, so there was no receipt or settlement. The market's foreign exchange rate remained unchanged. It opened at eight points in the morning and afternoon. For ticket transactions, more than 3.2 million yuan was transferred in the morning market, with more than 400,000 yuan in new transactions and more than 300,000 yuan in afternoon transactions. More than 450,000 yuan was traded in the Small General Association. As for the situation of coordination in other commercial aspects, it can be said that there is nothing that can be done, let alone the simplicity and complexity of remittances and overdrafts. The money houses received and settled more than 4.1 million yuan in foreign public bills. As usual, there was no receipt or settlement of foreign exchange transfers. Remittances from various routes amounted to more than 500,000 yuan. The market price of subsidiary coins in Jiangnan had no rise or fall. The price of Guangdong subsidiary coins was raised by 0.2%, with the dark plate at 11 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li. In the morning market, 20,000 transactions were made, and there were no changes in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins remained the same, at 302,000 wen. Transactions of 6,946 strings were made, totaling 2,300 yuan.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of sources from various gangs still only reached more than 20. The total amount of goods was nearly 5,000 shi. However, sales in this street turned sluggish, so the market situation was stable. The price of thick early japonica rice had no major fluctuations. More than 1,000 packages of thin rice from Dalian and Yantai were handled, and the market situation was also stable. Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan are all settled.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the ships carrying sources from various routes downstream arrived. Various goods on the market went to the stomach. Because of the cloudy rain in the morning, there were few listings by the stores, and retail sales were flat. The price of white japonica rice was stable. Thin rice arrived sparsely and sales continued to decline, and the price was also tightly held near the ruler. Yang Jian and He Ping were stable, and the port tips were fixed. Yin Bianyuan was stable. The other goods had no major fluctuations.</p>

<p>The heated price surge of soybean cake is rare in recent years. Soybeans are showing a trend of exceeding the six yuan mark, so the market price of oil cake is even more remarkable. The market continuously reported tension yesterday. The soybean demand of oil pressing plants in this city and inland workshops is very strong, resulting in an opportunity to throw off soybeans in Dong Province. It is estimated that eight carloads of spot beans on Siping Street and fifty carloads of road goods were ordered, as well as nineteen carloads of second-class beans and one carload of spot beans on Tongliao Street and seven carloads of road goods. More than 2,000 packages of other yellow, Du, and late beans were also opened.</p>

<p>The appearance of new dried scallops is still far off. The old goods at the bottom are about to run out. According to current investigations, the total number of each grade in the hands of the firms is less than fifty boxes. However, the Hunan gang is not keen on handling them. The destinations such as Jiangxi, Hankou, and this street are even more limited. If the business of each gang turns around, there is a risk of a shortage of goods on the market. Therefore, those with existing goods are waiting for the price to sell well. The current market price of large machine-dried scallops is 125 yuan, medium-sized Nagasaki scallops are 115 yuan to 110 yuan, medium-sized Fushan scallops are 92 yuan to 75 yuan, domestic medium-sized Jian scallops are 88 yuan, small-sized ones are 78 yuan, rice scallops are 75 yuan, Jiangbei bamboo scallops are 36 yuan, medium-sized Ning scallops are 85 yuan, and medium-sized Yantai scallops are 52 yuan, with red ones at 45 yuan and small ones at 42 yuan. Compared with the market price last week, it has risen by 5 yuan or 10 yuan. Considering the stable market situation and the thin bottom goods, there is a possibility of continued rise in the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was flat due to sluggish trading. The public board listed 24 coarse granulated white spot goods at 22 yuan, transshipment goods at 6.65 yuan, East Red (MS) mark at 15.8 yuan, No. 4 East White spot goods at 21.95 yuan, transshipment at 6.95 yuan, No. 8 spot goods at 21.6 yuan, transshipment at 6.6 yuan, and No. 9 fork spot goods at 21.7 yuan, transshipment at 6.4 yuan. The factory's fine white Jin Xin fine white No. 1 is 20.8 yuan, and Dahua No. 1 is the same price. The remaining rates were returned. Transactions on the number plate were also rare. Only Jianbang opened dozens of bags of Diaoqing, and Chao Bang opened 87 bags of Huanggang Qing at 10.45 yuan. It is said that there are still thousands of bags of Qing sugar traded privately, the goods are selected from Gaocheng, and the price has also slightly increased, which needs to be verified. Jianbing such as Wangmao, Peacock, Lion Ball, and Double Lion have continued to arrive, totaling more than 200 boxes.</p>

<p>The Longjing green tea from Lion Peak in Hangzhou has long been famous in society. Every year after the Qingming Festival, the tea farmers there start picking. This year, due to the cold weather, the tea buds developed a little later. According to a letter from Hangzhou, the mountain tea around West Lake has begun to show its tips. Tea farmers in various places plan to start picking leaves next week. Twenty or thirty tea merchants from Suzhou, Shanghai, and other routes have also gathered there to prepare to purchase new goods. However, due to the severe cold last winter, the branches and leaves of the tea trees have withered, and the future production will inevitably be less than in the past.</p>

<p>Since the price of 200-pound narrow strip iron was raised by the Company Steel, sales have been quite good. Can factories, cigarette factories, paint companies, and toy factories have all started purchasing. The market supply and demand are unbalanced, and prices are rising steadily, rising by 300 to 400 jiao compared to before. For example, 3 inches to 10 inches per box (200 pounds) sells for 24.5 yuan, 2 inches to 10 inches sells for 23.5 yuan, and 1.5 inches to 8 inches per box only opens at 22.25 yuan.

<p>Recently, the situation of yarn and flowers has been unusually strong. Generally, cotton industry peers have been very keen on selling short because the price has reached a high level. However, gold merchants and securities merchants have seen that their own businesses are bland and tasteless and have concentrated on the yarn and flower market, intending to drag it in. As for the financial community, most of them have bought in and have further plans to take delivery and hold on to a large number of spot yarns, so the market price is in a situation where it is easy to rise and difficult to fall. Recently, more and more chips have been traded in standard yarn and flowers, and the scope has been expanding daily. The total volume of standard flower transactions was 900,450 dan. The prosperity of this transaction is not surprising in the new flower season, but it is really commendable in the old flower era, which shows the strength of the two sides' combat power. The total transaction volume of standard yarn was 374,550 packages, which is also more than usual. The changes in the future are still in turbulent waves.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Good Demand for Spot Cotton Last Week <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Last week, the news regarding American cotton was positive. The market here was lackluster. The movement of White Rowan Creek cotton gradually decreased, while that of Gejula cotton was relatively smooth. Although only 2,300 bales were registered and released, it was generally believed that a large quantity would continue to arrive. Inquiries from Japan, the mainland, and Lancashire declined, but transactions in Shanghai saw some progress. Demand for spot cotton was good, and the market was firm.</p>

<p>— Shi Jifa</p>
<p>(V) Opinions on the Improvement of Anhui Tea</p>
<p>Anhui tea, struggling on the brink of death, is primarily facing a sharp decline in production due to abandoned tea gardens, bankrupt tea merchants (suffering losses), and a desolate tea market. For example, in Wuyuan and Tunxi alone, there were originally over 300 tea factories, but in recent years, due to financial pressures, over 100 have ceased operations. Foreign sales have been shrinking daily. Farmers, unable to sell their tea leaves, have also abandoned tea fields to seek alternative livelihoods. Many tea-producing areas, due to their mountainous terrain, such as various counties in Huizhou and counties like Liuan, Yingshan, and Huoshan in northern Anhui, have suffered from bandit-communist devastation in recent years, leading to abandoned tea gardens. Furthermore, transportation in these mountainous counties is obstructed, making external transport inconvenient and further depressing the tea market. The following are methods for reorganizing and improving Anhui tea:</p>
<p>(I) Investigation: Investigate the tea-producing areas of various provinces and counties within the country, comparing the types of tea, values, and annual production quantities to understand the overall state of the tea industry. Items such as poor quality manufacturing and packaging should be investigated and improved upon at all times. As for tea-producing countries abroad, such as India, Ceylon, Java, and Japan, their tea varieties should also be investigated for their strengths and weaknesses. The superior ones should be purchased and propagated widely in tea-producing provinces and counties across the country for uniform improvement of planting. Other factors closely related to tea leaves, such as soil, geology, and climate, should also be carefully investigated and studied. Chinese tea distribution centers should be established in various commercial ports at home and abroad for both retail and wholesale, with the aim of expanding sales channels. Specialized investigators should also be established to specifically investigate the conditions of each sales channel and report to the government (province/county) at all times, which will then relay the information to various industrial organizations for transportation and broader sales.</p>
<p>(II) Guidance: Anhui Province has long enjoyed a reputation for tea production, but it lacks guidance. The tea industry is declining daily. In the future, more tea affairs training institutes should be established, enrolling a number of trainees to study specialized techniques. After graduation, they should be assigned to various tea-producing areas to guide farmers or jointly organize companies and cooperatives to improve and popularize tea, thus developing the future of the tea industry.</p>
<p>(III) Promotion: During each tea season, tea industry organizations (companies, cooperatives, agricultural experiment stations, agricultural science students, public education centers, farmer education centers, etc.) should send a number of lecturers to various tea-producing areas to promote methods of improving tea leaf planting, seeds, fertilization, and production. They should also contact various tea firms and tea merchants to discuss concrete measures for organizing tea production companies and purchasing machinery to fundamentally improve production. Jointly publish pamphlets, booklets, and various promotional leaflets, slogans, and advertisements to promote sales externally. Over time, this will become widespread, and the benefits will be substantial. In addition, the exquisite packaging of tea leaves and the beauty of trademarks can also be used to promote its advantages through text and images, thereby expanding sales.</p>
<p>(IV) Experimentation: Research and experimentation on tea affairs primarily involve seeds, fertilizers, soil, chemistry, climate, rainfall, insect pests, etc. However, given the current financial difficulties and the underdeveloped state of science, experimentation cannot be fully comprehensive. Priority should be given to indispensable experiments and research, such as nurseries, propagation, transplantation, pruning, strip sowing, row sowing, grafting, and other improved (scientific) production methods, following the steps of successful experiments in India.</p>
<p>(V) Improvement: (A) Chinese tea farmers generally do not pay attention to cultivation methods, or they simply use old methods. Tea planting in counties such as Liuan, Huoshan, and Shucheng in northern Anhui involves plowing and fertilizing only once a year, or sometimes neither plowing nor fertilizing, essentially treating the tea plants as if they were wild and not cultivated. The situation is similar in counties like Qimen, Wuyuan, and Qiupu in southern Anhui. Moreover, it is not easy to manage and cultivate in high mountainous areas, and nutrients in the soil are washed away by rain, leading to premature aging of tea trees and reduced leaf production. Therefore, tea gardens and tea industry organizations must pay attention to management. In sloping areas, strip sowing is recommended to suit tea tree growth, retain soil nutrients, and facilitate both work and management. Flat areas should be designated as nursery areas for transplantation and collection from other fields. (B) Only 2-3% of Chinese tea farmers use fertilizers. The fertilizers they use are generally human excrement, bean cake, oil cake, wood ash, compost, grass fertilizer, rice straw, etc. In Qimen County, rapeseed is grown everywhere for oil production, and the remaining residue, commonly known as "ku," is rich in protein and inexpensive, making it suitable for fertilizing tea trees. This method of fertilization should be widely promoted. (C) Production methods: Previously, the production of red and green tea relied solely on manual kneading. Now, reform and innovation are needed. Withering and fermentation of black tea using sunlight is not ideal because the heat is too intense, which can create a sunburned taste and lack of aroma when brewed with boiling water. Indoor withering should be adopted. The machinery used for green tea production is optimal, but due to economic difficulties, it is temporarily inconvenient to purchase. Imitate the original manual kneading method by steaming the leaves, then placing them on a cooling platform to reduce moisture slightly. Afterward, roast them with charcoal fire inside the kneading bed. After drying, the shape, color, aroma, and taste will be extremely beautiful. (D) Packaging: In northern Anhui, tea leaves are packed in bamboo baskets lined with cattail leaves, which is crude and unsatisfactory. Over time, the color, aroma, and taste will be greatly diminished. Although tea firms in southern Anhui use wooden boxes, they do not appeal to foreigners, and the box panels are too thin, often breaking during loading and unloading by customs. This creates inconvenience for foreign buyers. It is proposed to improve the packaging by producing colored iron bottles and cans in various sizes such as half a pound, one pound, five pounds, ten pounds, or in pounds, similar to canned food and biscuits today, to appeal to foreigners and facilitate transportation on travel vehicles and ships. For overseas exports, sturdy wooden boxes weighing fifty or one hundred pounds should be used for long-distance transportation and sales.</p>
<p>(VI) Promotion of Sales Channels: (A) Regularly publish surveys and statistics related to the tea industry, foreign preferences, trade conditions, financial situations, improvement strategies, and research findings, discussions, introductions, and critiques by experts, so that domestic tea merchants and tea farmers can learn from them. In addition, publishing specialized books and pamphlets can promote sales. (B) Contact tea merchants and tea firms in Beijing, Shanghai, Hankou, Fujian, Tianjin, Jinan, and other places to organize tea industry exchanges, cooperatives, and companies to form a complete sales plan. (C) Anhui tea producers lack knowledge of foreign languages and international trade, making it difficult for them to trade directly with foreigners. They have to rely on tea firms and listen to the instructions of interpreters, subject to the monopoly of foreign merchants and the deception of tea firms, resulting in unspeakable suffering. This also hinders the development of the tea industry. In the future, if distribution centers can be established in various foreign ports for retail and wholesale, with direct transportation and sales, the losses of tea merchants can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>(VII) Steps for Reorganization: (A) Establish more planting and manufacturing branches or research institutions, hiring specialized personnel to provide guidance. (B) Organize a tea industry limited liability company for joint operation, developing the tea industry and expanding overseas and domestic commercial ports and markets. (C) Establish a tea industry bank or other financial institutions to circulate funds and activate the market. (D) Establish a tea industry inspection bureau to crack down on the production of substandard products and prevent unscrupulous merchants from mixing in inferior goods, which would damage foreign credibility. Promulgate regulations and strictly inspect to prevent unscrupulous merchants from engaging in fraud or manipulating the market. (E) Establish schools to cultivate specialized tea industry personnel, using research and practical methods to develop the future of the tea industry. (F) Raise funds to purchase machinery and scientifically improve tea production and manufacturing. (G) Manage tea gardens, eliminate pests, irrigate, and fertilize to increase production and improve tea quality. (H) Develop transportation to facilitate the transport of tea leaves. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e156">Arise, Children! <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xijian</p>
<p>"They seem to think that children, besides eating and playing, understand nothing and can do nothing."</p>
<p>These are some words from the declaration of the Children's Travel Group of the Ten Children's Organizations in West Lake to the children. Yes, in people's minds, children simply give others this kind of impression, and are utterly incapable of anything else. However, because they could not bear this humiliation and ridicule, they "used facts to shatter this erroneous view of underestimating children." They came to Shanghai, earning their travel expenses through labor, without the leadership of teachers, and finally arrived safely in Shanghai. This heroic feat has shattered the humiliation suffered by tens of millions of children over thousands of years.</p>
<p>The purpose of their coming here is to see how imperialism oppresses the people of our semi-colonial countries and the people of all walks of life in Shanghai. This is so brave and worthy of praise!</p>
<p>Dear children! Living in such a city, witnessing the oppression of imperialism and the different characters of all walks of life, what are your feelings? Do you feel sad? You eat your father's food, use your father's money to study, and still rely on your father to see movies, eat candy, and play with toys. Do you feel sad or happy? Can you endure this enormous humiliation?</p>
<p>I hope that you will also "unite" like the ten children in Hangzhou and "show our strength to do something for them to see, so that they will no longer underestimate us in the future."</p>
<p>Children! Arise! Don't lie in your mother's arms, living that sweet (?) life! Know that although candy is very sweet, in the end, it always leaves a slightly sour and unpleasant taste in your mouth. Let you rise and shatter this erroneous concept!</p>

<p>— Da Zhai</p>
<p>This child's name is Martin. He lives in Austin, Texas, USA. He is only ten years old this year and was admitted to Austin High School in the summer of the year before last. He is expected to enter the University of Texas next year.</p>
<p>His talent is especially intelligent. Before the age of two, he could read short English sentences. At the age of three, he could clearly remember the names of the borders between the states of the United States. At the age of four, he was able to study astronomy and geography on his own with very good results. At the age of five, he entered a private middle school in Austin. In two years, he skipped to junior high school, and in another two years, he skipped to high school again.</p>
<p>His reading speed is an average of 1,600 words per minute. At his fastest reading speed, he can read 2,100 words per minute, as tested by the "scientific eye" method at his school.</p>
<p>From this scientific eye, it was also discovered that the reason why Martin can read so quickly is that when he reads the first line, his eyes are already slanted to the left, looking at the second and third lines... continuing to look down. This perfectly fits the saying "reading ten lines at a glance," which is impossible for ordinary people.</p>
<p>Generally, those who are extremely intelligent are often unwilling to study hard, but Martin makes studying his only hobby. Also, it is difficult to understand when reading too quickly, but Martin's memory is not weak after reading, and he can speak very clearly and thoughtfully when telling others about it. There are also people who are intelligent and willing to study hard, but do not like sports and are often physically weak, but Martin loves sports very much. He likes horse riding and swimming the most, so his body is very strong. He weighs 90 pounds and is four feet eight inches tall, looking like he is thirteen years old.</p>
<p>Martin is particularly intelligent, which is difficult for ordinary people to force, but his hard work and training of his body can be done by all children!</p>

<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>"Min'er, your body is not very strong, how can you serve the country in the future? So you must always pay attention to exercise, exercise is the only way to build a strong body, but don't be too strenuous, just one hour of exercise a day is enough. On the one hand, eat some supplements, this is the so-called external cultivation and internal nourishment, and your body will naturally become strong." Min'er's father always told him this. So one afternoon, he bought a bottle of cod liver oil back. Min'er felt that the cod liver oil was fishy and unpalatable, so he didn't want to eat it, but in order to strengthen his body, he had to reluctantly eat it. He didn't understand why his father gave him something that didn't taste good?</p>
<p>"Dad, why don't you give me something delicious to eat, but you insist on giving me this unpalatable cod liver oil? What are the benefits of cod liver oil?"</p>
<p>"There is a substance in our lives that is indispensable, that is, vitamin, also called life element. This substance was first discovered in rice and milk, but the quantity is very small, and there is relatively more in cod liver oil. If we lack this vitamin, we will not be able to avoid becoming weak and unhealthy."</p>
<p>"What is this cod liver oil made of?"</p>
<p>"Cod liver oil is made from a kind of sea fish in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This sea fish is called the cod, which is produced in the northern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This cod is large and small. The large ones average about twenty to thirty pounds, which is about fifteen to twenty catties in our country. The small ones are also twelve pounds. You can know the size and shape of the fish by looking at the picture on the cod liver oil bottle. It is 150 to 500 feet below the seabed, so catching the cod is not easy. Cod is rich in fat, and cod liver oil is extracted from it. Its meat can also be eaten, fresh, pickled, or dried, but this fish is not sold in our country's markets.</p>
<p>"The countries that operate this fishery include England, France, the United States, Japan, and Newfoundland. The coastal area of Newfoundland (in North America) produces more fish, so in 1713 AD, England made Newfoundland a colony."</p>

<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>Treasure in the Well</p>
<p>A merchant was carrying many pearls and treasures, walking at night, and accidentally fell into a dry well. This well was more than ten feet deep. It was more difficult to climb out than to ascend to heaven. So he was anxious and sweating, shouting, "Help! Help!"</p>
<p>Four or five people nearby heard his shouts and ran over. But one of the most powerful people drew out a knife and pointed at the other three or four people, saying, "I'll save him, you're not allowed to save him! He is my cousin, only I can save him, get out!"</p>
<p>The others, seeing him so fierce, stood aside and watched for the time being. So he leaned over to the well and said to the man in the well, "Look, those people just now were robbers trying to steal your things. They didn't really come to save you. Now, I'm here to save you." As he spoke, he took a rope and dropped it down from above. The man in the well thought that the savior had really come, and hurriedly grabbed the rope, wrapped it around his waist, hoping that the people above would pull him up immediately.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the man shouted, "Wait a minute, first hang your pearls and treasures up, and I'll keep them for you. There are many robbers here, and you don't have the strength to deal with them!" The man in the well didn't think it over carefully, and in confusion, listened to his words, tied the pearls and treasures to the rope, and hung them up. The man got the pearls and treasures, took a large stone, and with a "smash," as if Mount Tai was pressing down, the poor stupid merchant was crushed flat.</p>
<p>The man went home with the stolen goods in a state of elation, but the people who had been watching just now suddenly came out to stop him and shouted, "Hey, friend, know what's good for you! Let's share the benefits, don't swallow them all!" So, this group of people all showed fierce faces and started fighting, each trying to grab the merchant's things.</p>
<p>The Kidnapped Child</p>
<p>The Zhang family had a child who was very smart and handsome, but the Li family next door took a fancy to him. One night, the Li family actually sent a few servants to break into the child's bedroom and carry him away. They insisted on changing his name and acknowledging them as his father. The Zhang family was not as powerful as the Li family and refused to cheer up, bearing the humiliation silently. The child lived in the Li family, suffering oppression and pain. Although the father and son lived apart, they always missed each other day and night in their hearts. The son thought in his heart, "Dad, although I have been robbed now, sooner or later, I will return to your arms." The father thought in his heart, "Poor child, I am really sorry for you, because I am useless and make you suffer like this. However, I will never forget you, and I will get you back one day."</p>
<p>However, things in the world are really infuriating: before the wishes of this unfortunate father and son could be realized, the powerful Li family had already taken further action. One day, he took a knife and ran to the Zhang family, saying fiercely to the Zhang family, "This child is mine now. From now on, his surname is Li, and I am in charge of all his affairs. You are not allowed to interfere. If you don't acknowledge him as his father, I want you to acknowledge this matter. If you acknowledge my words later, please take this knife first!"</p>

<p>Scientific Trivia</p>
<h3 id="e163">Is the Air Fresh in the Woods in the Morning? <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Zi Xi</p>
<p>Everyone knows that people cannot breathe in polluted air and must breathe in fresh air often. In fact, the so-called pollution of air is just that there is too much carbonic acid gas in the air: the so-called freshness is just that there is less carbonic acid gas in the air. It is harmful to breathe in polluted air and beneficial to breathe in fresh air. Many people think that the air in the woods in the morning is very fresh and that breathing it in is very beneficial to the body. But this view is not entirely correct. Because plants perform a photochemical reaction during the day, absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen; at night, they perform a respiratory reaction, absorbing oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Therefore, in the woods in the morning, the photochemical reaction has not yet prevailed, and the carbonic acid gas released during the respiratory reaction last night is still stored in the woods. So, can the air in the woods in the morning be considered fresh? But, as long as the prevailing photochemical reaction has passed, it will be very fresh and clean. So it is important for children not to go to the woods too early to breathe.</p>
<h3 id="e164">What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future? <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>

<p>The modern world—the world of the twentieth century, is a world of science. In the world of science, there must be a scientific China. Who will create a scientific China? It is up to the children of China to create it. So, what kind of children should the children of China be? They should be scientific children.</p>
<p>In the past, I was an ignorant child, living a life of amusement in a hazy way. Since I read Tao Xingzhi's "How to Be a Scientific Child," it startled my hazy mind and made me realize that I must work hard and serve society in the future. I must never waste the most precious period of my life—my student days.</p>
<p>I hope that I will be a person like Franklin Watt in the future, creating many scientific instruments to supply China to fight against the enemy, recover the four northeastern provinces, abolish all unequal treaties, and raise China's international status, and also become a strong country, standing side by side with the Central American countries in the world, and doing my best to rescue weak nations and resist violence, to create myself into a scientific person, with a union of hands and brain, with no fear, to conquer all of nature.</p>
<h3 id="e165">The Tale of a Loyal Dog (14) <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>The old Red Mill, which he originally considered his sole destination, was a place he frequented. He would always stop in front of the mill, where a little girl with a cloud of curly hair would peek out to welcome him. In her rosy little hands, she often held a bone or a piece of hard bread for Baderxi to eat.</p>
<p>Now, every time they passed, Baderxi would look with disappointment at the closed door, and Xiao Fuluo no longer stopped in front of it. His heart filled with bitterness, he hurried past. Poor little Ailuo in the house sat on a small stool by the fireplace, tears streaming down her face, dampening the knitting in her hands. Her father, Kegangshi, worked beside the millstone and flour sacks, his resolve unchanged, secretly saying to himself, "This is for the best! That child always thinks about useless things; he's destined to be a beggar. If I let them stay together, who knows what troubles it will cause in the future!"</p>
<p>Although Xiao Nanluo was treated coldly like this, he didn't complain, because he was naturally quiet. His grandfather, old Dashi, had often told him, "We are poor people, and we must submit to God's will in all things. Whether we receive good or bad, we should accept it, because the poor cannot choose."</p>
<p>Xiao Nanluo listened quietly to these words, because he respected his old grandfather very much. However, he was a gifted child, so a sweet and uncertain hope whispered in his heart, "But the poor can sometimes choose—choose to become a great person, and no one can say they are wrong."</p>
<p>He always thought about it silently. One day, Xiao Ailuo accidentally bumped into him in the rice fields by the canal. She ran to his side and hugged him, sobbing sadly, because tomorrow was her name day, and her parents were preparing a celebratory feast, but they weren't inviting Xiao Nanluo to participate, which made her sad and tearful. Xiao Nanluo kissed her and said to her quietly with great confidence, "Ailuo, things will change one day. The piece of pine board that your father brought back will be as valuable as silver. He won't keep me out then. Just always love me, dear Ailuo; just always love me, and I will definitely become a great person."</p>
<p>Xiao Ailuo asked through teary eyes, "What if I don't love you?"</p>
<p>Xiao Nanluo's eyes left her face and looked far away, straight to the spire of the Great Mosque illuminated by the golden-red setting sun. A sweet and melancholic smile appeared on his face, which startled Xiao Ailuo. He burst out a firm word in his breath, "I will eventually become a great person, Ailuo. If I don't, I might as well die."</p>
<p>Xiao Ailuo pushed him away, pouting, and said, "Then you don't love me." Xiao Nanluo shook his head, smiled slightly, and walked away triumphantly through the yellow straw. A vision seemed to appear before him, a splendid future, as if he had returned to his hometown in high spirits, proposing marriage to Xiao Ailuo's parents.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Foreword <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>Of the four greatest issues concerning people's livelihood, housing has become increasingly important in our country in recent years, and its impact has grown. In particular, production has been sluggish recently, and all industries have declined, but the need for housing has not decreased significantly. Moreover, due to the progress of new construction, the number of buildings in major cities is increasing day by day. The national cost each year is at least tens of millions of yuan, and the percentage of foreign materials is almost 70% or more. Therefore, it has become an extremely serious problem, similar to the influx of rice, wheat, yarn, and cloth. How to seek a remedy quickly is the responsibility of all citizens. However, it is ultimately better for specialists and entrepreneurs to understand and be closely involved. Furthermore, our country's architecture has a history of thousands of years, and it goes without saying that it represents the Far East. But in this era of rapid academic development, and with the environment constantly changing, how can we bring out inherent advantages and absorb foreign ideas to create an epoch-making style? Both of these issues urgently need answers.</p>
<p>However, in recent years, specialists and entrepreneurs have been burying themselves in their business, and no longer have the leisure to do more fundamental research. Therefore, the above-mentioned situation is gradually evolving day by day, and no one has been able to raise awareness and seek to remedy it. This danger is probably no less than clothing and food. Moreover, clothing and food are relatively simple, unlike the complexity and cost of housing. Therefore, the issue of housing can be said to be particularly important and serious in our country today. Colleagues, aware of this, have launched the Architecture Exhibition, with the intention of gathering specialists, scholars, and architectural peers from all over the country to jointly seek improvement measures, to learn from each other in academic theory and practice, to acquire new knowledge and methods to suit the times. At the same time, we want to give the public a full understanding of the inherent advantages of our country, and gradually digest and absorb them for application in modern things, in order to become a national style and establish new standards in the East. Therefore, we are soliciting submissions in five major categories: models, drawings, materials, tools, and books and periodicals, to meet the needs of this association and provide viewers with research material. Experts are invited to lecture on important issues in architecture on different days, in order to exchange knowledge. I believe that this exhibition will give the audience a deeper impression and become a new driving force to promote various skills and undertakings related to architecture. It is not merely to admire beauty and communicate ideas.</p>
<p>It seems strange that various sectors of the country have not paid deep attention to architecture, a matter so closely related to life. But it is not too late to plan for it now. Moreover, the country spends tens of millions of gold yuan on construction each year, and it is estimated that more than thousands of architects and supervisors are needed for construction, but the country can only train less than a hundred such talents each year. No more than a few universities across the country have architecture departments, and the facilities are far from complete. I don't know whether the education authorities think this is enough, as it has been temporarily forgotten. But there is no doubt that this phenomenon needs improvement. It is hoped that the authorities concerned will give it special attention.</p>
<p>As for the industries related to architecture, such as steelmaking, ironmaking, copper production, afforestation, timber production, paint production, pigments, enamel, ceramics, cement, bricks, tiles, stone, and various decorations, they are directly and indirectly related to the national livelihood and are related to the rise and fall of interests. Observing the general psychology, it is not that people do not know the fear of leaks, but domestic products are not enough to meet the demand. Sometimes, although domestic products are available, due to poor management and poor marketing, they cannot be obtained. And engineers and the construction industry are afraid of difficulties and take convenience, which turns into a habit, thus blocking the way for the development of domestic production. Cause and effect multiply, and things are getting worse. We cannot but hope that those concerned will quickly realize it, and that the authorities will do their best to promote it.</p>
<p>Moreover, our country's architecture is not backward. There have been famous experts in every generation. Since the opening of the sea, we have not been able to stick to the old rules, and inevitably picked up the leftovers of others. In the past 20 years, the domestic expenditure on large buildings has been huge, and the remuneration has been abundant, but there are very few who can come up with unique ideas and express their unique intentions. This is also a shame for our academic and business circles. Looking at how developed architecture and industry are in various countries, books on the study of our country's architecture are still emerging endlessly. Comparing the two, can we not feel ashamed? At present, world architectural patterns are tending to focus on the Eastern style. For the sake of the future of the entire architecture and for the sake of promoting the inherent characteristics of our country, we should have a plan to extract the essence and provide it to the world, and its responsibility is irreplaceable. Furthermore, how can our country's architecture in the future produce a new style, a Chinese style in the world, a Chinese style of the present era, while taking into account both inherent habits and economic conditions, so that it does not run counter to the real life of the people, and contains the significance of maintaining and developing the national livelihood? These are all the things that our architectural circles should painstakingly worry about and seek to answer: because this kind of responsibility, apart from our architectural circles, no one can shoulder. Therefore, the responsibility of our colleagues in the architectural world today is definitely not to be satisfied with obtaining their own fame and fortune, and to think that they are worthy of this era and national society. It is hoped that colleagues will pay great attention to this point during this gathering. Now, at the beginning of the opening, I dare to directly present my thoughts as above, and I hope that the public will teach me.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Preface to the Journal of the Chinese Architecture Exhibition <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Our country's architectural studies were established the earliest. The "Kao Gong Ji" (Record of Trades) in the "Zhou Li" (Rites of Zhou) states, "Examine the curved surfaces and shapes to embellish the five materials and manage the people's utensils. This is called the hundreds of crafts." This is the beginning of architects in China. "The craftsmen are in charge of building the state, with the ancestral temple to the left and the altar of land to the right, facing the court and behind the market. The main roads are nine chariot tracks wide, the circular roads are seven tracks wide, and the field roads are five tracks wide." This shows that the construction of palaces had reached perfection, and had further developed into the construction of roads. The Afang Palace of Qin, the Weiyang Palace of the Han dynasty, the Dew Terrace, the Changhe Gate, the Taiji Hall of Emperor Wei Ming, the Zongzhang Temple, and the Lingyun Terrace, were all more than ten feet high, with phoenixes built on top of them, jade wells with brocade railings, toads holding and receiving, and divine dragons spitting out various structures. They followed the old ways, increasing their splendor and becoming extremely magnificent. Although they had already initiated the licentiousness and excess of Chen Houzhu's Linchun, Jieqi, and Wangxian Palaces, and Emperor Sui Yang's Maze Tower, from the perspective of architecture itself, we can still measure its rapid progress. Occasionally, I have examined the prosperity of architecture in our country, and there are two reasons for this. The Chinese people are ingenious and good at thinking, and they do not want their residences to be simple and crude. Therefore, after clothing and food, they must embellish their houses to gather their families and enjoy their etiquette. The "Kao Gong Ji" in the "Zhou Li" records that all people above the commoners have sleeping temples and schools, and the rooms where they usually live are called palaces. This is the proof. The Chinese people have a deep love for the past, and attach great importance to ancient buildings. The buildings of the Han and Tang dynasties, such as the Great and Small Wild Goose Pagodas, the Hall Without Beams, and the Single-Pillar Hall, still exist today. They have been destroyed and rebuilt many times, and repaired and renovated repeatedly. If it were not for the Chinese people's deep attachment to ancient objects, they would not be able to stand tall. With these two reasons, it is appropriate that Chinese architecture stands out in the East. Mr. Ye Yuhu and others are erudite and fond of antiquity, and especially like Chinese architecture. Therefore, they have organized the Chinese Architecture Exhibition, and they probably know this intention deeply. It is expected that it will promote Chinese culture and arouse the interest of the Chinese architectural community in using the past to create the new. The expansion and development of Chinese architecture will be determined by this meeting. As the conference journal is about to be published, Mr. Yuhu asked me for a preface. I am not talented, and I especially do not know about Chinese architecture. I will respectfully recite the anecdotes of ancient Chinese architecture and use it as a title for a few hundred words to correct it.</p>

<p>— Shanghai Architectural Society</p>
<p>Regardless of their type or nature, buildings have three major purposes: namely, economy, applicability, and aesthetics. In European and American countries, due to material development and cultural progress, architecture before the war rarely considered the above three principles. However, after the war, they received extraordinary lessons, and the architectural style changed dramatically. For example, the clumsy podium lines of the past, the rigid window frames or door frames, and the head lines around the outer doors have all been abandoned, and replaced with simple and clean planes and corners, striving for economical, beautiful, practical, and durable structures; unlike the cumbersomeness of the past, which was not practical, costly, and annoying.</p>

<p>Several years ago, there was a fierce war of words in various architectural engineering publications and newspapers in Japan. The progressive faction advocated the modernization of Japanese architecture, while the conservative faction advocated conservatism. The final conclusion was that the faction advocating the conservation of Japanese architectural styles was gradually eliminated. Last year, due to the pro-fascist movement, there was another proposal for Japanese-style architecture, hoping to revive it. But in a short time, the　　　lun was extinguished again. Buildings are the symbols of human cultural progress; the evolution of styles has various complex reasons such as social economy, and its latent power is very great, and it can never be conservative and stagnant. Therefore, the faction in the Japanese architectural world that advocated conserving Japanese architecture was repeatedly defeated because it did not meet the needs of the times, and could not exist. Its failure was inevitable.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Republic of China, various constructions have been actively carried out. Since the revolution was completed and the capital was established in Nanjing, all administrative facilities have gradually been put on the right track, and the government authorities have made more efforts to build, with full scale. Looking at the various courts, ministries, and associations in Nanjing, all of them have been built one after another. In addition, there are many more public offices to be built. It is possible to take this opportunity to create a new architectural style that meets the above three principles of economy, applicability, and aesthetics. Because the current general architectural style is deeply felt to be rich in imitation and has lost its unique creative ability. Although we cannot forget our ancestors, it also loses the spirit of the new era to move and perform feudal products such as styles. The spirit of the new China must be expressed with epoch-making architecture. If the palace style is still used as the standard for architecture, not to mention its economic beauty, durability and applicability, but the suspicion of sticking to the old ways and not seeking progress is difficult to deny. I still remember that when Mr. Tan Zhen traveled to Germany to study the judiciary, he met a famous professor of law who asked Mr. Tan, saying that since the completion of the Chinese Revolution, the promulgation of laws has been based on the spirit of the Three People's Principles. Professor of architecture is asking about the current style and trend of Chinese architecture, I am afraid that it will be difficult for famous Chinese architects to have a real answer at a time, or they will say directly that modern Chinese architecture has a dual imitation: one is to imitate Western styles, and the other is Chinese ancient architecture. As for the new architectural style of the new China, it has not yet been conceived, and it is even more difficult to speculate when it will be conceived.</p>
<p>However, the creation of fine art in an era depends entirely on the efforts of artists and the supervision of society in that era. If the sages of the current architectural world can devote all their efforts to the research of new Chinese architectural styles, if there is any gain, they can describe it in writing, openly discuss it, and collect the opinions of the people. The conclusions obtained will definitely provide many inspirations and contributions to the new Chinese architectural styles. Or, with this power, a certain style can be produced, so that the Chinese architectural world will show a new dawn.</p>
<p>Buildings with rich imitation are often felt to have only a clumsy appearance and no spiritual sustenance. This may be because they are too imitative, focusing on copying, and looking at them is boring, making people feel intestinal gas. In front of us, we only feel a pile of solid objects, lacking a new spirit of creation. The general public may not understand the truth, and only feel that it is magnificent and beautiful; but those involved should know that China is in a precarious situation, and material resources are difficult. Only by seeking hard work and perseverance can we survive in the end. If we repeatedly move and perform this kind of architecture that is rich in feudal thoughts and wastes manpower and financial resources, the architects will be too ignorant of the current serious national crisis!</p>
<h3 id="e170">General Situation of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>1. Main purpose of work</p>
<p>The work of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture focuses on studying the inherent architectural techniques of China and helping to create new architecture in the future. However, Chinese architecture, in terms of time, includes more than 4,000 years up and down; in terms of space, it extends from Japan in the east to the Pamirs in the west, from Jiaozhi in the south to the vast desert in the north. Architecture within this time and space is completely under one system. The highest and final goal of this association is to complete the history of this architectural system.</p>
<p>However, this architectural system with a long history and vast territory has been dismissed by scholars and officials in its birthplace for thousands of years. Although there are many relics, there are many documents that cannot be examined; sorting them out is often difficult. Therefore, to thoroughly study its history and technology, it is necessary to seek documentation and match it with physical objects. Therefore, this association temporarily established two groups: documentation and methodology, to divide the work and cooperate. For the convenience of work, we will start by studying the architectural style of the Qing Dynasty palaces. After we have a good understanding of the Qing style, we will trace back to the Ming and Yuan dynasties, and then seek the Song and Tang dynasties, in order to solve the problem easily. In order to achieve the above-mentioned objectives, the work mainly focuses on field investigation. The remaining work of sorting out old books and compiling books is focused on practical aspects. The research results will be used to plan the repair of ancient buildings by domestic groups, and to provide reference materials for teaching or design.</p>

<p>. In recent years, the work of the association has gradually been recognized by the general public, and the association has gradually gained the opportunity to contribute and serve, which is a pleasure for colleagues.</p>
<p>2. History and General Situation of Work</p>
<p>In the seventh year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhu Guixin passed through Nanjing and browsed the books in the Jiangsu Provincial Library. He discovered the manuscript of the "Yingzao Fashi" (Building Standards) of the Song Dynasty by Li Mingzhong. He then negotiated with the authorities and agreed to publish it in lithographic edition. Later, he and Mr. Tao Lanquan collected various editions of the "Siku Quanshu," including the Wen Yuan and Wen Jin editions. After careful proofreading, in the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the Song-style edition of "Yingzao Fashi" was re-published. Scholars at home and abroad gradually learned that there was also the study of construction in ancient China. Later, Mr. Zhu devoted himself to the collation of the Qing Dynasty's "Engineering Practice Rules and Regulations." By the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhu felt that the scope of research was expanding and that it was not easy to work independently. Therefore, he negotiated with the Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture to subsidize 15,000 yuan for research expenses each year for a period of three years. Thus, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture was organized, and private research became an academic organization. Later, subsidies were continued, and it has been seven years now (the twenty-fifth year of the Republic of China).</p>
<p>In March of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture was formally established at No. 7 Baozhuzi Hutong, Beiping. At that time, the scope of research focused on the collation of ancient books and the translation of foreign works. In addition to the collation of the Qing Dynasty's "Ministry of Engineering Practice Rules and Regulations," which began in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China and still needs to be continued, the "Yuan Zhi" was also collated, and the materials of "Zhejiang Lu" and "Yingzao Da Shi Nian Biao" were collected. Also, in this year, the first volume of the "Hui Kan" was published in two issues, the main items of which include the founding of the Society for Research in Chinese Architecture and the opening speech, the commemoration of the 820th anniversary of Li Mingzhong, the proofreading of the re-published Song-style "Yingzao Fashi," the "Yuan Dadu Palace Garden Tu Kao," and several translations. At that time, there were fewer than ten staff members.</p>
<p>In March of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, an exhibition of cultural relics from the Yuanmingyuan was held in Zhongshan Park, Beiping, which attracted the attention of society. In the second year, in addition to continuing to collect documentary materials, the "Hui Kan" in the second volume increased to three issues, the main items of which include the "Ji of Imitating the Sutra Pavilion of the Putuozongcheng Temple in Rehe," "Yingzao Suan Li," and the collation and printing of the "Gong Duan Yingzao Lu" and other articles.</p>
<p>In July of the twentieth year, the Society was reorganized into two groups: documentation and methodology. The work of the documentation group focused on the collection of historical materials, and Mr. Zhu himself served as the director. The methodology group focused on physical measurement and the collation of methods and regulations, and Mr. Liang Sicheng was hired as the director. The staff increased to more than ten people. The important works include the compilation of "Zhejiang Lu" and the collection of historical materials of the Ming Dynasty's Beijing Palace Garden, and the measurement of the Liaojian Guanyin Pavilion, Shanmen, and the Three Bodhisattva Hall of the Liaoguangji Temple in Binzhi County, Hebei Province. Since then, members have been dispatched in groups to investigate in the spring and autumn seasons every year, which has become the main work of this association. And the "Hui Kan" has been set as a quarterly from this year, publishing four issues a year, and the contributions are limited to the research papers of the members.</p>
<p>In July of the twenty-first year, because the address of the society in Binzhuzi Hutong was not enough, the Zhongshan Park Board of Directors agreed. It was moved to the West Chaofang inside Tiananmen, as the address of the association. Mr. Liu Dunzhen was hired as the director of the Documentation Group. The staff increased to more than 20 people. The main works of this year include the investigation of ancient buildings in Zhengding and the compilation of the "New Interpretation of Yingzao Fashi," the collection of historical materials on construction in the Ming Dynasty's "Shilu," and participation in the repair plan of the Wen Yuange and other places in the Forbidden City in Beiping, and the supply of reference specimens and models to many domestic and foreign groups and schools.</p>
<p>In September of the twenty-second year, ancient buildings in Yingxian and Datong in Shanxi, and Zhengding and Yuanshi in Zhao County, Hebei, were investigated, and historical materials on construction in the Qing Dynasty were collected. The "Qing Style Yingzao Rules and Regulations" written by Mr. Liang Sicheng was also published in this year.</p>
<p>In the summer of the twenty-third year, the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund decided to subsidize the association with 20,000 yuan for the compilation of books and records, which was paid in two years. In the autumn of this year, the relics of Taiyuan, Wenshui, Fenyang, Xiaoyi, Jiexiu, Lingshi, Huoxian, and Zhaocheng in Shanxi Province, and Hangzhou, Jinhua, Xuanping in Zhejiang Province, and Dingxing, Laishui, Yi Zhuo in Hebei Province were investigated. Construction Hall, planned the repair plan of Liuhe Pagoda in Hangzhou. The following spring, the Cultural Relics Consolidation Committee of the former capital hired the association as a technical consultant to repair ancient buildings in Beiping. Also, at the invitation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Education, the plan for the reconstruction of the Confucius Temple in Qufu was planned. In May, antiquities in Anping, Quyang, Dingxian, and Anyang in Henan, and other places in Hebei were investigated, and the Qing Palace-style bridge seat was sorted out.</p>
<p>In the autumn of the twenty-fourth year, the Wenyuan Pavilion, Wenhua Hall, and the Inner Cabinet Warehouse of the Forbidden City were measured, as well as ancient buildings in Suzhou and the ruins of Lama Pagodas in Beiping. Edited the "Reference Atlas of Chinese Architectural Design," "Investigation Report of Ancient Buildings," "Panoramic View of the Collection of Books in Wenyuan Pavilion," and "Chronicle of Events in the Ming Dynasty."</p>
<h3 id="e171">A Brief History of the Shanghai Architectural Society <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>The Shanghai Architectural Society has a history of seven years since its establishment. The comrades in the architectural world originally had a gathering in Yingchunfang, Zhejiang Road. Later, due to differences in opinions, it was divided into two, and finally merged into one, and Rongyangli in Pingwang Street was rented as the meeting place. In a few years, due to changes in personnel and changes in the environment, the once-prosperous club affairs returned to a state of sluggishness. Although there were a few enthusiasts who came to the meeting every day, unfortunately, at this time, a member was kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of the lane, so the other members were afraid and dared not come, and regarded the meeting place as a dangerous place, so they had to temporarily end this gathering.</p>
<p>Because of our professional relationship, we often have the opportunity to get together. Since the club affairs were suspended and scattered for a long time, we felt that the organization of the group has great potential for promoting friendship, exchanging business, and cultivating the spirit. We also felt that the previous gatherings without purpose and organization had the function of uniting, but no central goal. Therefore, after a long period of brewing and many discussions, the Shanghai Architectural Society was initiated in the spring of the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. The author was publicly elected to draft the constitution, and a preparatory office was set up on the third floor of No. 19 Jiujiang Road. In addition to the old members from the Rongyangli era, many newcomers were also recruited and jointly listed as initiators. At this time, the initiators had divided opinions on the progress of the club affairs. One was radical, soliciting 1,000 members at a time, each paying a membership fee of 200 yuan, for a total of 200,000 yuan. In this way, land could be purchased to build a club, and the daily expenses could be taken from the income of the remaining houses of the club, so that the future of the club affairs could be based on a stable and long-term basis. The person who advocated this proposal was Mr. Chen Shouzhi, and those who agreed were Zhu Quantong, Lu Songhua, and Wang Fafao. The other side was opposed to this faction, believing that the club was still in the preparatory stage, and there was little work to be done, and not many people understood the purpose of the club. It was better to publicize widely and solicit members on a large scale. After the club was formally established and gained the belief of the general public, the aforementioned proposal would be implemented. The person who presided over this view was Mr. Tao Guilin, and those who agreed were Jiang Changgeng and Tang Jingxian. The author's proposition is between the urgent and the slow, only seeking that the club affairs can move forward, both are good strategies. All my views are moderate and progressive.</p>

<p>Constructed by Jiutai Jinji Construction Factory</p>
<p>After a considerable period of preparation, with approval and encouragement from all sides, the spirit of active progress was further stimulated. Now that the association's affairs had taken shape, the only task was to complete the procedures for registration with the Party and government authorities. The Shanghai Special City Party Department's Civil Training Committee sent personnel to inspect several times, deemed it qualified, and issued a certificate of permission to establish. Following the regulations, a request for registration was submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, which sent personnel to inspect several times before granting approval. In the summer of the nineteenth year, during the preparatory period, a bulletin was compiled and published weekly, dedicated to preparation news, along with specialized translations, and distributed to various architectural engineering groups, organizations, and individuals, to publicize the association's affairs and to make the general public aware of our objectives. The current Architectural Monthly has its roots in this nascent bulletin. In the autumn of the same year, in view of the shortage of intermediate architectural engineering talents, the Enemy Reserve Committee established a vocational supplementary night school, publicly recommending Mr. Tang Jingxian as the principal. Classes were held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM daily, with a curriculum divided into elementary and advanced levels, each lasting three years, for a total of six years of study. At the beginning, three classes of the elementary level were recruited first, with students mostly being apprentices from construction factories, and draftsmen and trainees from architectural engineering firms, each having their own full-time jobs during the day.</p>
<p>During the preparatory period, the early compilation and printing of the bulletin and the establishment of the night school were practical and garnered external sympathy. At this time, the preparation of the association's affairs proceeded smoothly, and there was enthusiastic demand from all sides to join as members. With the registration procedures successfully completed, there was an urgent need to conclude the preparatory work and formally establish the association on a fixed date. The preparatory committee decided to hold the inaugural meeting on February 28th of the twentieth year at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association on Xizang Road. Prior to this, a request was submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Education Bureau to send personnel to attend for guidance and supervision of the election.</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on February 28th of the twentieth year, pedestrians streamed along Xizang Road, and carriages followed one another, all heading towards the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association, clearly to attend the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Architectural Association. On that day, attendees included representatives from Party and government organizations, namely Li Jiran from the Municipal Party Department and Li Dachao from the Municipal Education Bureau, guests including Shen Junyi, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, Dong Dayou, Wu Mai, and all members, totaling over three hundred people. Wang Gaosun, Xie Bingheng, Chen Shouchi, Tao Guilin, and Du Yange were publicly elected as the presidium. The meeting opened with a speech by Wang Gaosun, followed by Du Yange reporting on the association's preparatory process. Representatives from the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Education Bureau then delivered speeches in succession, followed by speeches from guests. Finally, the association's charter was discussed and approved, and officers were elected in accordance with the charter, including nine executive committee members, three alternate executive committee members, three supervisory committee members, and two alternate supervisory committee members. The elected executive committee members were Tao Guilin, Wang Gaosun, Jiang Changgeng, Lu Songhua, Tang Jingxian, Du Yange, Chen Shifan, Chen Shouchi, and Xie Bingheng. The elected alternate executive committee members were Sun Deshui, Gui Lansun, and Xu Huchen. The elected supervisory committee members were Zhu Quantong, Chen Songling, and Wang Faho. The alternate supervisory committee members were Fang Xianghe and Zhang Yutian. The elected executive and supervisory committee members were sworn in, and a photograph was taken before the meeting adjourned. On the same day, the Shishi Xinbao (The China Times) published a special broadsheet on the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Architectural Association. (We originally planned to publish a thick special issue on that day, but due to insufficient time for compilation and printing, it was postponed for one month.) On the same evening, a grand banquet was held in the entire hall of the Dadong Restaurant, attended by over five hundred Chinese and foreign guests and members. During the banquet, speeches were given by Mr. Jiang Changchuan, the son of Mr. Jiang Yusheng, a pioneer in Shanghai's architectural field, and lawyer Wu Mai, followed by entertainment, and the gathering concluded late into the night.</p>
<p>On March 2nd, the first joint meeting of the first executive and supervisory committees was held, and Wang Gaosun, Jiang Changgeng, and Tang Jingxian were elected as standing committee members, and Wang Gaosun was elected as chairman among the standing committee members. The work was divided into nine sections, each with specific responsibilities, namely: (General Affairs) Jiang Changgeng, (Accounting) Chen Shouchi, (Investigation) Lu Songhua, (Education) Tang Jingxian, (Academic and Publicity) Du Yange, (Materials) Tao Guilin, (Equipment) Xie Bingheng, Wang Gaosun, (Introduction) Chen Shifan, etc. In July of the same year, due to the progress of the association's affairs, the original premises were no longer sufficient, so the association moved to No. 316-318 Pushi Road in the French Concession. In the autumn of that year, the entire China suffered a rare historical flood. Provinces were inundated, almost becoming swamps. Lamentations of refugees were everywhere, a tragic sight to behold. At this time, most of the association's energy was spent on fundraising for disaster relief, which was the responsibility of individuals and organizations and the most urgent action at the time. Unexpectedly, before disaster relief was completed and appeals were still ongoing, the border province sounded the alarm on September 18th, and the work of national salvation had to be taken care of as well. In this environment of internal troubles and external threats, mutually tormenting each other, it was truly difficult to seek the progress of the association's affairs, and maintaining the status quo was already a great blessing.</p>
<p>On January 28th of the twenty-first year, an unfortunate conflict occurred in this port city again. Due to this turmoil, Shanghai, known as the national commercial and financial center, fell into a state of depression and stagnation in all industries. Profit-making production organizations found it difficult to maintain themselves, and consumer groups and enterprises felt that there was no way to proceed. The affiliated night school was also temporarily suspended due to the declaration of martial law at night due to the war, which made it inconvenient for teachers and students to travel. It was decided to wait for the situation to stabilize before resuming classes. At this time, the association entered a state of invisible stagnation, and in the process of progress, it tasted cruel flavors.</p>
<p>The responsible colleagues, bearing the entrustment of all members, were still planning the association's activities day and night despite the extremely difficult environment. At the same time, as the term of office had expired, it was imperative to re-elect in accordance with the charter. Furthermore, as the association's location on Pushi Road in the French Concession was inconvenient, it was moved to No. 620, 6th Floor, Continental Emporium, Nanjing Road, the current location, in the summer of the twenty-first year, and Rooms 616 to 618 were opened as a reception hall for members to relax and receive guests. At the same time, the affiliated night school was also moved to No. 18 Guling Road, Changsha Road, and students were recruited starting in the autumn, and classes resumed as usual.</p>
<p>After the association moved to the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road in the summer of the twenty-first year, the association's affairs progressed and showed signs of resurgence. In September of the same year, an order was received from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, which was then forwarded by the Shanghai Municipal Government to the Ministry of Education of the National Government, approving the registration. Thus, the registration procedures with the competent authorities were completed, and the Shanghai Architectural Association was listed as one of the legal organizations in the country. The executive and supervisory committees considered that the term of office had expired and that the second general membership meeting should be convened in accordance with the charter to report on the status of the association's affairs, discuss progress matters, and re-elect officers, etc., and it was decided to hold the meeting on October 9th in the association's reception hall. In addition to all members, the attendees included Mao Xiaxuan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Nie Haifan, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, who came to guide and supervise the election. The elected members of this term included Tang Jingxian, Tao Guilin, Jiang Changgeng, Xie Bingheng, Sun Deshui, Du Yange, Lu Songhua, Wang Yuefeng, and Chen Shouchi, as executive committee members. The alternate executive committee members were Yin Jizhi, He Jingdi, and Tao Guisong. The supervisory committee members were Zhu Quantong, Chen Songling, and Chen Shifan. The alternate supervisory committee members were Sun Weiming and Wang Faho. At the first meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, Tao Guilin, Xie Bingheng, and Du Yange were elected as standing committee members, and Tao Guilin was elected as chairman among the standing committee members. Since taking office, the officers of this term have held regular meetings and weekly meal meetings to discuss association affairs and provide more opportunities for gathering, with the twelve executive and supervisory committee members taking turns on duty. In November of the same year, the inaugural issue of Architectural Monthly was published. Subsequently, the service department, library, and other facilities were established one after another, adding a lot of work to the association's affairs.</p>
<p>On October 20th of the twenty-third year, the third general membership meeting was held in the West Hall on the 9th floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA in accordance with the charter to report on the status of the association's affairs, discuss progress matters, and re-elect officers, etc. In addition to the members, the attendees included Mao Xiaxuan, representative of the Municipal Party Department, and Nie Haifan, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, who came to guide and supervise the election. The chairman was Tang Jingxian. After the rituals were completed, the report on the association's affairs and the revision of the charter were completed in succession. Finally, the results of the re-election of officers were as follows: the executive committee members were Zhu Quantong, Yao Chang'an, Chen Songling, Ying Xinghua, Chen Shouchi, He Jingdi, Yin Xinzhi, Sun Deshui, and Sun Weiming. The alternate executive committee members were Wang Minzhang, Chen Shifan, and Wang Faho. The supervisory committee members were Jiang Changgeng, Tao Guilin, and Lu Songhua. The alternate supervisory committee members were Tang Jingxian and Du Yange. On the same evening, a dinner party was held, attended by guests Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, Jiang Kanghu, Xie Fusheng, Xu Xiaotian, and all members. During the banquet, speeches were given by Mr. Pan and Mr. Jiang, followed by entertainment such as architectural films and performances by the Datong Music Association. The first joint meeting of the third executive and supervisory committees produced three standing committee members: Yin Xinzhi, Lu Xinghua, and He Jingdi; and Mr. Yin was elected as chairman among the standing committee members. Later, as Mr. Yin often went on business trips to other cities and could not reside in Shanghai permanently, he resigned from the position of standing committee member and chairman, and Chen Songling was elected as standing committee member and chairman in his place. In order to increase the efficiency of the association's work, the Editorial Committee of Architectural Monthly and the School Affairs Committee of the Affiliated Night School were established. Chen Songling, Jiang Changgeng, and Zhu Quantong were elected as editorial committee members. Ying Xinghua, He Jingdi, and Yao Chang'an were elected as school affairs committee members. Since taking office, the officers of this term have shown a more enthusiastic service spirit than before, and all facilities have been put on the right track. However, because the entire society is trapped in the gloom of recession, the economy is declining, people's lives are withering, and all kinds of enterprises feel the depression of a slump. The association's income can only provide a part of the expenses of the association headquarters, and there is still a need to raise huge amounts of funds to maintain various affiliated enterprises such as the monthly magazine and night school. Therefore, in addition to being responsible for handling the association's affairs, the officers of this term have also put a lot of effort into raising funds.</p>
<p>Up to now, the Zhengyi Architectural Industrial Supplementary School affiliated to the association (named specifically by order of the Municipal Education Bureau) has held one graduation ceremony, with seven graduates: Liu Jiasheng, Wang Cheng, Huang Rongfang, Zhang Shanxiang, Wu Haozhen, Zhu Yunjun, and Zhang Yaozhong. The graduation certificates have also been verified and returned by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Each student has their own full-time job, and their skills are being applied, which is not in vain for the association's painstaking cultivation with huge sums of money for several years. The second graduation will be held in the summer of this year, and the semester has not yet ended, and the results have not been reviewed, so the number of graduates cannot be determined at this time. Architectural Monthly has been published to Volume 4, Issue 2. In terms of architectural books, the Architectural Dictionary can be published by the end of June this year, and the Continuous Beam Calculation Formula has been printed and is now on sale. The works of Mr. Lin Tongyan, an internationally renowned engineering expert, such as the Cross Continuous Frame Calculation Method, which have been published successively in Architectural Monthly, only need to be sorted out and can be printed immediately. Other works such as Engineering Valuation, Construction Science, and Architectural History, etc., will also be printed separately and listed as part of the series after they are published in the monthly magazine, in order to fulfill a slight responsibility in architectural culture.</p>
<p>The association has been established for seven years now. Outsiders will have their own evaluations of the achievements, and it is not convenient to elaborate. However, the author believes that the future harvest still needs to be cultivated with current efforts. As for whether the harvest is rich or not, let's not ask yet!</p>
<h3 id="e173">Characteristics That Architects Should Possess <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Zongyao</p>
<p>Design Ability</p>
<p>Design is crucial for architects. They spend a long time researching various architectural styles and methods to acquire specialized knowledge that others do not possess, which is also appropriate. Architects make the spatial distribution of any building convenient, so that each space is perfect in form and size. Architects should also know how to distribute the construction of each part so that it occupies the most advantageous position, and so that the entire plan can be achieved. Furthermore, the houses built by their drawings have convenient entrances and exits, which benefits the homeowners. Architects who lack intelligence are not like this: they often cause one part of a building to occupy too much space, or another part to occupy too little, or one part's position to be inconsistent with the plan, or they cause the passageway to occupy too much or too little space. All of these cause inconvenience or unsuitability to the users. Technically excellent architects pay attention to all aspects, so the above-mentioned shortcomings can be avoided.</p>
<p>From the economically important standpoint, in a limited position, architects can solve all the difficulties for the occupant and precisely plan the required volume, without neglecting even one cubic foot of area, and without failing to make it reach the most useful path. Because increasing one cubic foot of space costs money, and abandoning it without applying it to proper use is equivalent to wasting money. Now, architects can use space without abandoning it, which is of great benefit to us.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Observation Materials and Construction Methods</p>
<p>Using superior materials and equipment in construction, and building with good methods, these two should always be expressed by architects as their characteristics and originality. The importance of this characteristic and originality to architects is self-evident; the key is to study this characteristic and originality during their training and when they start drawing in the drawing room. For example, they observe various construction materials, examine their appearance, consider their durability, and then think about how an experienced person would select and specify various construction materials to realize their original plan. When construction begins, they should supervise and observe how materials are placed, such as whether they are appropriate; later, they should review whether the methods used and the materials taken are consistent with what was previously used.</p>
<p>Material suppliers often provide various materials and samples, so construction architects can often contact them or other representatives. In their spare time, they can also visit factories to understand the manufacturing methods of bricks, tiles, wood, marble, and oil cloth. In addition, from newspapers, architectural publications, and contemporary conversations about architecture, they can also obtain the essence of all professional undertakings, such as the comparative experiments transmitted by the U.S. Bureau of Standards (U.S.B. of Standard) and other famous industrial school laboratories, they can also take their essence as a reference. In short, they must be like merchants who buy the best materials, and when we hire them, they are our merchants, so that we can get excellent materials and save money.</p>
<p>Architects must inform material suppliers of what kind of materials are needed to achieve the intended effect during construction, adding color to those that are excellent and suitable. They supervise the project according to their policy, and sometimes ask reliable assistants to do it for them. When the construction is completed, we must be satisfied with the building's firmness and durability, and if it needs to be named or repaired in the future, the cost will be minimal. Because the foundation is solid, the ceiling is dry, the roof is firm, the walls do not transmit cold, heat, or moisture, the floor is always dry and does not crack, the ceiling lasts long and does not fade, and the stairs are easy to go up and down without noise. In short, a building that pays attention to everything and achieves such an effect is nothing more than for our enjoyment and peace, and to save us money, without the need for constant repairs.</p>
<p>Aesthetic Concepts Should Be Possessed</p>
<p>The third key point about architecture is aesthetics. Architects should use good plans to make the building suitable, and how to rely on their knowledge of building materials to ensure that it is strong and durable after completion has been detailed above. What I want to discuss now is the architect's drawings. Any completed building must have beauty: and this beauty is also unique to architects, so that they stand out from other businesses engaged in construction. Good engineers and architects know how to build well, and can even develop their ability to reach economical and elective plans; however, it is rare to see architects who have a full sense of beauty. I dare not say that every architect can possess this kind of aesthetic concept, and can reach the highest level; but I dare to silently say that every architect must have a considerable degree of aesthetic concept at least. Therefore, those who aspire to be architects must have drawing and aesthetic concepts. Their usual thoughts are mostly various concepts such as ratio, average, quasi-harmony, timbre, color, light, and experience: all day long, they are also immersed in ancient architecture, painting, sculpture, music, literature, and drama. All of these things have the word "beauty" in the middle, and after a long time, it is not surprising that architects possess aesthetic concepts. Architects can distinguish between good and bad beauty, and can apply this principle to construction, so the buildings formed by their drawings should be able to stand out from the buildings of ordinary untrained and unintelligent workers.</p>
<p>Regarding the concept of beauty, we can at least understand a little. If there are two things here, and we are allowed to choose, we must choose the better one, without a doubt. If we choose clothes, furniture, or cars, even if the various points of each type of object are the same, the result is that we choose the more beautiful one. If choosing objects is like this, then why not houses; because we want gorgeous houses and beautiful rafters. If architects add beautiful decorations to the building, the value of the house will increase, and the houses of the neighbors will also prosper, and the rent of this house will also increase as a result. Therefore, a house built with a good drawing and a house built with a worse drawing, even if they are in the same location and the same place, will definitely be more expensive when sold, it can be said. Bankers often make mortgage loans for houses with beautiful appearance, because they know that the value of houses handled by good architects must be considerable, and they must be easy to sell when sold one day. Real estate operators often say that in houses in the same convenient location, those that are beautifully built are easier to rent out than those that are inferior. From the above, the quality of beauty has commercial value, and can exceed the quality of firmness and convenience. Who can provide this quality other than architects?</p>
<p>Knowledge of Building Codes Should Be Possessed</p>
<p>There are several laws and regulations in various states in the United States that are related to construction. Therefore, architects must understand these laws and regulations so that the owners do not suffer any losses.</p>
<p>The current laws on architectural registration and licensing established in various states are to prevent a group of people who pretend to be architects from impersonating them, causing harm to the public. This law specifies that architects must receive considerable training, and prohibits general people without sufficient qualifications from being called architects. Therefore, general architects must be registered to be considered legal. In the registration law, the building codes of various cities and towns are often listed, such as the construction cost and planning cost, which must not exceed a certain number; if there is an excess, the architect must report it. Many of the states that do not have this law now also adopt it.</p>
<p>The so-called building codes refer to the old rules of various places, and the rules of various places are also different from each other. Therefore, if you want to build a house in Location A, you must comply with the building codes of Location A; if you want to build a house in Location B, you must also comply with the building codes of Location B at the same time. In addition, there are zoning or land section laws, which are also related to building houses. Furthermore, the state laws, insurance laws, contract laws, and public safety laws of various states and regions must be fully understood for construction. In addition, the federal patent law should also be studied; because if a certain style is adopted, and this style was invented by someone and has a patent right, a patent fee must be paid first before it can be adopted. For example, if you want to build a low-style counter for a bank building, the architect should know that this is a patented style, and it cannot be adopted without paying a patent fee. If you want to build several car garages, and you don't use elevators up and down, and you have to follow the law, if you don't know that this style is also patented, that is, even if the patentee has no direct relationship with this building, and the owner doesn't have to follow a certain patent. Paying the patent fee is the owner's responsibility; but it is the architect's responsibility to let the owner know about this current position. Therefore, architects must also understand building codes such as various patent systems.</p>
<p>Knowledge of Contractors Should Be Possessed</p>
<p>If architects have knowledge of contractors, they can decide who is qualified and who is not qualified when we invite workers to bid. If we listen to their advice, we can avoid everything related to bad projects, poor materials, and disputes. With their knowledge and experience, architects can introduce honest contractors to us. These people are responsible for their work and do not want to ruin their reputation. Architects choose a reliable and lower price among the prices asked by these people and let them build it, so that the owner can get satisfactory results without any worries about the architect; and on the other hand, they can save money, and even the amount saved exceeds the architect's remuneration. From this point of view, the benefit of architects to us is not also great! (Translated from the American Pencil Point magazine)</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Duties of an Architect <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Zong</p>
<p>In general, the success of a building project depends on very detailed procedures. Here, from the architect's consultation and planning of the building's progress to its completion, I will briefly describe the steps involved.</p>
<p>When we intend to construct a certain type of building, we should first go to an architect and inform them of the architectural style, location, and interior layout, as well as determine the size of the project, the preferred style, and the budget. In short, all information about the construction should be clearly communicated. The overall design should be discussed, and even minor details should be debated. The architect's duty is to ensure that the owner is satisfied with the work. How can they fulfill their responsibilities if they don't know everything, big and small? During the consultation and planning phase, we should share our needs and preferences. If the architect feels something is unimportant or unsuitable, they should use their knowledge and experience to explain the situation in detail, outlining the advantages and disadvantages. At the same time, the owner should listen to the architect's advice, just as they would listen to a doctor or lawyer. This would show wisdom.</p>
<p>When the architect is planning and proceeding, they will propose many things that are beyond our expectations. These suggestions are what we need and represent the most complete and innovative architectural solutions. Therefore, we should gladly accept them. The architect should thoroughly discuss the building's location, current and future land rental values, transportation, as well as drainage, gas, water, heating, and electricity. If deemed necessary, the architect can visit the site with the owner to gain firsthand knowledge. In short, before the architect begins to draw up plans, there must be multiple contacts and discussions with the owner before putting pen to paper. Initially, only a rough plan and an exterior design are created. This exterior design complements the original plan, and its beautiful form and harmonious colors should please viewers. At this point, the owner can observe and assess the architect's knowledge.</p>
<p>If you want to estimate the final cost of the completed building, it is difficult to predict the exact amount during this initial planning stage. Even if the architect can calculate the cost per cubic foot and then multiply by the total cubic footage to get an estimate, it is rare for the final cost to match the initial estimate after the building is completed. General contractors, with detailed drawings and specifications, still find it impossible for their bids to be within ten or twenty percent of each other. How much more so without detailed drawings and specifications? These initial plans and exterior designs are only for our reference, to see if we approve of the original plan or want to make changes.</p>
<p>When we view the initial plans and colored sketches, we can get an impression of the entire building and point out the advantages and disadvantages of various architectural styles for discussion. This continues until the sketches are revised and perfected to the owner's satisfaction. In this way, both parties agree, and the architect can determine the direction of progress. During the discussion period, within reasonable limits, we can make changes to the building as we wish, without any hindrance, no matter how many times. If all the initial consultations are carried out effectively, much trouble can be avoided in the realization of a complete plan. In short, we should be careful in advance and not act rashly, because what people care about is to be given working drawings and specifications.</p>
<p>Items not included in the working drawings are called "extra conditions". Architects and contractors dislike the existence of such conditions, as they can lead to disputes in the future. Therefore, during the negotiation, it is best to consider everything carefully, leaving nothing unmentioned in the conditions, to avoid future troubles.</p>
<p>Once we approve the plan and the cost of the building is within our intended range, the architect will begin the final working drawings and specifications. These two are extremely important because the contractors base their bids on them.</p>
<p>The working drawings and specifications contain information to give to the contractors. These documents are quite important and must be clearly expressed, otherwise, the contractors cannot calculate accurately and will inevitably ask for a higher price, fearing disputes and losses in the future. In this case, the owner's money is wasted. Therefore, all working documents must be carefully reviewed by an engineer to avoid excessive demands.</p>
<p>Our responsibility for the building is not limited to informing the architect about the location and reasonable requirements. We must also carefully review the initial sketches, working drawings, specifications, various suggestions, contracts with contractors, and other documents related to the architect and the owner. In short, the architect should not bother the owner with irrelevant matters. What they want to discuss is what they are entrusted to do for us. Their working drawings and specifications are the architect's words to the contractor, and they represent the architect's own ideas.</p>
<p>Working drawings are not academic exercises, sketches, or pictures, but drawings for work. Good working drawings give the contractor the same instructions as needed, without any deviation. These drawings must be clean, clear, accurate, and without vague conditions. The contract between the employer and the contractor is based on this, including the smallest and most visible details, such as foundations, floors, walls, heights, and descriptions of all parts of the building. From these specifications, the contractor can estimate the value of various materials and make an accurate list of material costs and all work costs, so they can ask for the lowest price. This price usually includes a profit of ten percent in addition to materials and labor costs. If the working drawings are poor and the conditions are unclear, the price will be high to prevent future losses and uncertain material costs. Improving the working drawings and specifications prepared by the architect can save us a lot of money.</p>
<p>Specifications are a written statement of all the guiding principles; this written expression fills in what is missing in the working drawings. These specifications must be clear and unambiguous, and all terms must be consistent with the terms in the working drawings. The quality of materials and the level of workmanship must be clearly stated. When drafting these specifications, refer to various material tests, material samples, and meet with material suppliers to compare market prices and determine which materials are most suitable for the building. In short, they are our purchasing manager for materials.</p>
<p>The complexity of working drawings and specifications is always proportional to the architectural style. For example, the cost of a hospital, residence, church, warehouse, or train station may be the same, but the drawings for the former are more complex and the latter are simpler. Therefore, the cost of the architect is often based on the form of the building. For buildings of the same cost, if the form is complex, the fee will be higher, and vice versa. Therefore, determining the fee based on the complexity of the drawings is the fairest method.</p>
<p>When we have approved the working drawings, we proceed to solicit bids from contractors. Under normal circumstances, the architect, as our representative, invites five or more contractors to prepare bids. Usually, they recommend several reliable contractors. If we have a familiar contractor, we can also include them. The working drawings and specifications are printed in blueprint form and distributed to each bidder. Each bidder estimates based on this the total cost of the building (including the contractor's capital and profit) and submits the sealed bid in a bid box before a specific date. To ensure fairness, the architect invites the owner to open and inspect the bids together. After opening, we often see that even with detailed working drawings and specifications, the bids vary greatly. The reason for this is the economic method of work, the method of construction, and the ability to purchase materials. Furthermore, the bids of general contractors include all the prices of subcontractors. The contractor undertakes the entire project and subcontracts each part of the building to subcontractors, such as plumbing, electrical, and hot water systems. Therefore, their bids are very different. General contractors usually undertake plumbing, excavation, and foundation work, while other work is undertaken by subcontractors. These subcontractors also enter into contracts and share responsibility for the work.</p>
<p>The matter of bidding has been described in detail. However, there is one thing that must be said: if bidders are unwilling to use inferior materials in the building, we can hire them regardless of how low their bid is. However, if we think their bid is too low and the bidder seems to be acting in bad faith, we have the right to reject their bid. After the bid is decided, the architect draws up a legal construction contract between us and the bidder, so that there is no doubt between the two parties and all work conditions are clearly understood, so that no disputes arise in the future. Sometimes the architect also requires the contractor to fulfill special conditions, otherwise, a fine will be imposed. This can affect the value of the work and make it slightly more expensive, but it can avoid the contractor's irresponsibility. In short, if the contractor is subject to these special conditions, we can rest assured about all aspects of the building!</p>
<p>Once these matters are completed, the drawings are submitted to the local government's construction department for review, and a building permit is requested. Then the contractor hires workers, gathers materials, and begins work, while the architect must also prepare detailed drawings.</p>
<p>Working drawings generally include all the conditions for the building. However, to ensure that contractors, subcontractors, and workers clearly understand the various conditions required for the building, the architect still needs to supplement detailed drawings to be distributed to the parties involved in the building, so that they make no mistakes or delays in the supply and formation of materials. The number and scope of these drawings depend on the complexity and size of the building. For example, when building a small-scale house, the number of detailed supplementary drawings will be less; if building a public library, the number of these drawings will be more. When detailed classification drawings are being built, the architect must plan how to eliminate the problems of wood shrinkage and expansion, moving parts in the building, and other unfavorable conditions. In this drawing, if the architect can accurately draw the carved ornaments, it will increase the beauty of the building. Sometimes the architect prepares a wooden model of the ornaments in advance, and then asks the craftsmen to imitate the model to achieve accuracy and beauty.</p>
<p>Architectural drawings can clearly answer all architectural questions and doubts. These drawings can not only reduce manufacturing costs but also increase the convenience and comfort of the building. For example, if the form and position of stairs, closets, bookshelves, and other utensils are clearly shown, they will be convenient and comfortable after they are made. Although the installation of various utensils is clearly shown in the drawings, due to the small size of the drawings, the workers still need to calculate carefully when implementing the installation. However, if all installations are calculated in detail by the architect, no errors will occur; and everything can be calculated by proportion, which is even more convenient. As for window decorations, eaves, chimneys, etc., they must be able to withstand wind and rain without peeling off. When the construction project is in progress, everything is prepared in the detailed drawings to avoid temporary haste, so that neither money nor time is wasted.</p>
<p>Even if the builder has specifications and detailed drawings, as well as explanations of all the minor problems of the building, it is impossible to guarantee that no problems will occur during the progress of the work. Therefore, the architect or their representative must often supervise the work in progress. If a large project is in progress, the architect must hire a supervisor to supervise regularly. If such a project is contracted by several contractors and there is no general contractor, then the supervisor cannot be omitted. Although it costs the employer more money, the efficiency of the work is greatly increased, which is convenient for the employer. In small projects, the supervisory representative of the contractor is responsible for checking whether the progress of each event in the work is consistent with the building register. The architect or their representative comes to check the materials used and the work in progress from time to time. When coming to inspect, sometimes some corrections are made: these corrections are difficult for others to know except for architects who have received several years of training. Also, if the architect does not propose these corrections, the workers will also ignore them.</p>
<p>The architect's observation of whether the materials and work meet the original work regulations is the most valuable and effective service for us. All contractors are honest and unwilling to commit fraud and neglect work, but it is human nature to be selfish. In short, they use inferior materials during the period to seek profit, just like sellers and buyers. The architect is not like that: their position is aligned with ours. They earnestly hope that the building will be successful and can do everything perfectly, which is the same as our original intention. Because this building can affect their reputation, they do not want many problems to occur and have unsatisfactory results. Therefore, they urge the contractor to do their best to complete the project. Inspection does not guarantee the elimination of bad work, so supervision is necessary. Inexperienced employers often give construction projects to those with the lowest bids, and claim that the contractor can give them excellent work, thereby not listening to the architect's advice.</p>
<p>We know very well that the architect can only be responsible for inspection due to other duties, but cannot be responsible for supervision. According to common practice, the scale of the project is small and only requires inspection, so the architect can act according to custom. However, when supervision is necessary, a supervisor must be hired. Although the salary is paid by the employer, the architect must also inspect</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>the project.</p>
<p>For all construction projects, except for extremely small buildings, a supervisor is indispensable. The architect must advise the employer to hire this person. The architect does so only to benefit the employer. When the employer and the contractor initially sign the contract, the method of paying the bid price must be specified. If a part of the work is completed and the contractor asks for payment, the architect shall issue a certificate proving that the part of the work has achieved satisfactory results, and the employer shall then issue payment. When the contractor requests payment, the architect shall inspect whether the work is satisfactory and whether it is carried out in accordance with the specified conditions before issuing the certificate. At the beginning, the contractor calculates the price of materials and labor, and divides them into several phases for the employer to pay, so they can also pay other small contractors. This calculation sheet is submitted to the architect, and the architect now issues a certificate for the employer to pay, which is also based on this sheet. When they present this sheet to the architect, the architect shall be cautious and ensure that the initial and mid-term payments are not too much to prevent accidents; they do so to benefit the employer!

<h3 id="e175">Discussions on Improving Chinese Architecture <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Du Yangen</p>
<p>The most distinctive feature of Chinese architecture is the roof. The magnificent glazed tiles, the unique beast-shaped ornaments, the standing and lying animal and human figures on the ridge, and the curved corners of the roof and the brackets under the eaves all demonstrate a full Chinese style. Therefore, in this time of declining national spirit, the inherent Chinese culture should be specially brought out. This contains the meaning of enlightening the masses and has the same significance as the reprint of ancient books by major bookstores and ethnic tomb sweeping. However, blindly imitating foreign things and blindly imitating ancient things are both criticized by the world. Therefore, in today's world, it is the right way to maintain the inherent spirit of our culture on the one hand, and to follow the world trend on the other hand. Taking the Chinese roof as an example, the wooden frame is originally used under the roof, and even the brackets at the eaves are made of wood. Now, because the wood is not durable and easily catches fire, reinforced concrete is used instead. However, the style of the brackets is still exactly the same as that of wood. The outside is painted and gilded. Moreover, because cement is prone to moisture and contains alkalinity, before painting, waterproof glue paint is applied, resulting in cumbersome and foot-binding work. This is only in terms of the reinforced concrete surface. As for the reinforced concrete used as roof trusses and roof panels, because the Chinese roof has a small slope, it is not beautiful, so it must be steep to show a dignified appearance. For example, the roof of a Chinese temple does not look very high from a distance, but when you step into the temple gate and want to see the head of the Buddha sitting in the center, you have to arch your neck. From this, you can imagine how high the roof is. Now, because the roof truss and roof are changed to reinforced concrete, and because of the load-bearing relationship of the reinforced concrete itself, and the wide span of Chinese houses, the structure of the roof truss is like a bridge, and the construction of the roof is difficult and costly. However, this is just one type of reinforced concrete roof truss and roof. As for glazed tiles, roof ridges, beast-shaped ornaments, and walking beasts, it is another cumbersome and material-consuming work, which violates the three principles of architecture: economy, aesthetics, and practicality. The uneconomical nature of the Chinese roof has been described above. The Chinese roof, from the eaves to the ridge, has a large area because of the steep slope. However, this large area cannot be used for proper purposes, which is an impractical drawback. Some people will definitely disagree with the unaesthetic nature of the Chinese roof and will criticize the author, so listen to the explanation. Aesthetics must have a sense of the times. In retrospect, let's discuss what is considered beautiful or not beautiful in this era. Simply put, in the past, Chinese women had to bind their feet, and the smaller the feet and the more unable to walk, the more beautiful they were considered. Now, what kind of feeling do you have when you see small feet? Furthermore, consider women's head ornaments, body suits, pleated skirts, and embroidered belts tied around the skirts, with bells hanging at the end of the embroidered belts. What kind of feeling do you have when you see women in this kind of dress now? These are all things that happened decades ago, so let's not mention them. Now, let's talk about the headdresses of our Mongolian compatriots, with all kinds of heavy and dazzling things. Although we can't directly say they are not beautiful, we definitely have doubts about their beauty. So, summing up the above, it is certain that beauty advances and retreats with the times. Then, can the so-called beauty of the Chinese roof stand firm in the ever-changing world for thousands of years? The critic must say no. Therefore, knowing that we cannot stay together and will eventually change, then we should not be bound by traditional ideas and not move forward, but should catch up quickly. All large buildings should be changed to reinforced concrete flat roofs, because flat roofs are really economical and practical. Moreover, all the required materials can be made in China. For example, cement is abundant in China, and steel bars are already made in China. Although the output is not much, the output will definitely increase once it is jointly promoted. Yellow sand and stones are almost everywhere in China, so there is no need to buy them from abroad. For the wood used for the shell, as long as the architect specifies in the specifications to use Jian pine or other Chinese wood as the shell, and use barrel wood for the props, then although foreign wood is cheaper than Chinese wood, Chinese materials will definitely be used in accordance with the specifications. Architects should be able to fulfill this responsibility. In this way, the construction of flat roofs does not require foreign materials. Only the felt and asphalt to be laid on the flat roof must be foreign goods. In fact, all of these can be avoided. As long as you pay attention to mixing evenly and pouring tightly when pouring cement, and there is no gap in the middle, and then use cement fine sand to smooth the surface after pouring, then this flat roof can be used without felt and without the worry of leakage. If the cement flat roof transmits heat easily, the problem is easier to solve. Just lay a layer of yellow sand on the smooth roof, build a layer of hollow bricks, pour coal ash cement on the brick surface, and then add cement fine sand to smooth the surface. In this way, the heat is blocked by the hollow bricks and cannot be directly transmitted to the room below, and the room will naturally be cool. After the above explanation, the economy and practicality of flat roofs should be clear. Only aesthetics and Chinese style need to be explained separately. Regarding aesthetics, it has already been said above that it should advance and retreat with the times. The trend of modern times is to focus on light makeup and plain colors, and those strong and gorgeous decorations are no longer suitable. Therefore, to seek aesthetics, you can add a little decoration to the eaves and use Chinese patterns, so that aesthetics and Chinese style can be solved easily. Furthermore, adding a Chinese roof on a three-dimensional building is an unnatural performance like pretentious behavior. I hope that architectural colleagues will have a revolutionary spirit and no longer be confined to one corner.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Architectural Industry <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Shanghai Architectural Society</p>
<p>It goes without saying that the architectural industry is more essential and grand than any other industry. However, ordinary people often fail to recognize this, leading to backward production and the purchase of large quantities of building materials from abroad, resulting in alarming financial losses over the years. Taking just the example of imported pine, the amount transported and sold in Shanghai, and then transshipped from Shanghai to inland areas, reaches 300 million feet annually, with a value of over 19 million national currency. Other materials needed for construction, such as steel, glass, water pipes, radiators, stoves, and electrical materials, are too numerous to list. Construction is the culmination of various industries and holds not only authority in industry and commerce, but also is closely related to the health, prosperity, history, and culture of a nation. Here are a few examples to illustrate the rest.</p>
<p>Architecture and National Health:  Few Chinese people can enjoy the beauty of their homes. Most ordinary people live in cramped and dilapidated rooms, barely able to turn around. As for the extremely poor, some even live in nests or caves. This is, of course, due to their weak economic capabilities. These dilapidated houses lack drainage ditches for sewage and bright windows; as for dry floors, rainproof roofs, and walls that block wind and snow, these are even more out of the question. The poor living in such poor environments experience a life almost unbearable for humans, which undoubtedly affects their intelligence and health. Moreover, in the severe winter season, rain and snow are mixed; and when summer arrives, mosquitoes breed; plagues arise, and deaths follow. Although these disasters primarily affect the poor on the surface, the vitality of the nation is also severely lost. The people are the foundation of the country, as the ancient saying goes: rich and poor, noble and humble, all belong to humanity. There is no time to not have compassion for these extremely poor and helpless people, how can they be neglected? Therefore, authorities in Europe and America pay special attention to housing for the poor. For example, England's slum clearance movement builds new houses to accommodate them. America's construction of smoke-free zones, with over four thousand households in each village, uses electric heating for cooking. These are all ways for the government to improve the lives of the poor. In recent years, our country's authorities have also gradually paid attention to this, such as the construction of civilian villages, which is a clear sign of benefiting the common people.</p>
<p>As for those with some assets, they all strive for large size when building houses. Houses with nine bays and deeper depth are not uncommon. As a result, there are few people in large houses, and cleanliness and order inside the house cannot be maintained. Cobwebs form, snakes and rats hide, and the atmosphere is gloomy, which greatly harms the hygiene of the house. The reason for building such large houses is nothing more than to facilitate weddings and funerals, to flaunt wealth and power, and to show off. As for seeking comfort, that is not the primary consideration. As for major cities, due to the higher land prices, there are so-called Western-style houses. However, the interior is neither Chinese nor Western, creating a kind of deformed architecture. Sometimes, in order to prevent thieves, the iron bars are strict, like a prison; living in it, one gains security but loses freedom. Therefore, most Chinese people live in dwellings that are either simple and unbearable or clumsily abnormal. It is rare to find a simple, elegant, and practical house. The health of the nation depends on the comfort of the home, and the Chinese people should pay more attention to this.</p>
<p>Architecture and Industry and Commerce:  As mentioned earlier, architecture is the culmination of various industries. Consider the smelting of the steel industry, steel beams, steel bars, reinforced concrete, steel mesh, and other steel materials. Although this industry is extremely large, it is, in general, only a part of the architectural industry. Other examples include mining and quarrying, extracting limestone, burning lime, and cement; as well as the extraction of granite and marble. These industries cannot be said to be small, but most of them have no possibility of development except for supplying the construction industry. In addition, industries such as forestry, sawmills, water and land transportation are all interdependent with the architectural industry, and their interests are closely related. The inseparable relationship between industry, commerce, and architecture can be seen in this. If the architectural industry is stagnant, these industries and commerce will be the first to suffer.</p>
<p>Architecture and History:  Architecture is most closely related to history. When we examine historical sites, architecture is the most reliable source. The architecture of previous generations can serve as the historical record for today's people, and the architecture of today's people can be left to future generations as a reference. The solidity and grandeur of the Great Wall show the defense facilities of the Qin Dynasty. Nowadays, archaeologists live among broken walls and shattered monuments, all in order to obtain reliable historical materials from them.</p>
<p>Architecture and Culture:  The culture of a country is expressed through books and paintings, and through drama and music; although they can each fully express the function of culture, the method of expression is most prominent and easily attracts attention through buildings. Other examples include sculpture and painting, all of which display the crystallization of architectural culture.</p>
<p>In summary, architecture is a comprehensive art with multifaceted relationships. Taking the example of a theater, it encompasses electricity, heating and cooling, sound, art, civil engineering, drainage pipes, water channels, lighting, hygiene, and safety equipment. This shows the complexity of its composition and the greatness of its construction. Those engaged in the architectural industry should all be glad to be a member of a great enterprise, and at the same time, should understand their own responsibilities and not fail the mission entrusted to them.</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Relationship Between Wire Mesh Fences and Architecture <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The development of the architectural industry in recent years has been rapid, and the magnificence of the external appearance and the splendor of the interior decoration of various buildings have been designed meticulously, and are constantly changing and improving. However, the outer perimeter of the building, which is related to the appearance, has not been improved. Looking at the major public buildings and private residences in Shanghai, and the exquisitely beautiful buildings and lush gardens, those who need to use the outer perimeter of the building all follow the old methods. The better ones are built with cement brick walls, and the worse ones are still surrounded by bamboo fences. The former is not very economical, and the latter is neither beautiful nor durable. Therefore, if you want to find a substitute that does not have these two disadvantages, there is nothing better than wire mesh fences.</p>
<p>Wire mesh fences have been used in various countries in Europe and America for a long time in public buildings, private residences, sports fields, stations, machines, factories, warehouses, doors and windows, etc. Because of their durable material, beautiful appearance, and ability to be installed in various shapes, they can also prevent accidents. There is nothing better than this to meet the needs of the outer perimeter and protection of buildings. It is a pity that few domestic architects have paid attention to this. The reason for this is nothing more than ordering from foreign countries, and there are many obstacles. The size of the fence eyes, the thickness of the wire, the height of the scale, the change of the installation style, and the configuration of the fence post materials all require accurate calculations in advance. If there is a small error, it will not meet the needs, or the foreign company will not be willing to order if the amount is too small. And the cost is unexpectedly expensive.</p>
<p>The Gongqin Iron Factory on Linqing Road, Yangshupu, Shanghai, already has this product. If you need this kind of mesh fence, you can directly inquire with the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e178">The Characteristics of Huaxin Cement Floor Tiles <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The composition of a room must have a bright ceiling, soft walls, and a beautiful floor. The ideal floor should have the following five characteristics: 1. The floor should be attractive. When a person enters a room, they must first come into contact with the floor, and the contact is more than any other part. Therefore, the material used for the floor should be harmonious with the color of the walls and ceiling and have artistic significance, so that people feel refreshed and not tired when they enter the room. 2. The material used for the floor must have the ability to resist external friction. It must be used for a longer time, and the floor will be firmer. After thousands of years, it will be no different from the new paving. 3. The floor material should have the advantage of never fading. All inferior materials will change color once they are paved. Although the four walls are beautifully decorated, the beauty of the entire room has been greatly reduced. 4. The floor should use materials that are easy to clean. If there is dirt, it can be washed at any time to maintain hygiene. 5. The floor should be paved with durable materials, so that the value paid once will never increase, in short, no more floor repair costs will be required in the future.</p>
<p>The above five characteristics are necessary for an ideal floor, and Huaxin Bricks and Tiles Company's cement floor tiles (commonly known as patterned tiles) can meet this demand.</p>
<p>The cement floor tiles produced by Huaxin Company are different from the patterned tiles sold in the market in terms of quality and color. Huaxin floor tiles use high-quality raw materials, the required machinery has the highest pressure, and the patterns and colors are poured in very thickly. The longer they are used, the brighter the brick surface will be. Even after decades, they will still not change their beauty and vividness. Using Huaxin floor tiles, the cost is lower than any other paving material except cement floors, and its durability may even exceed it.</p>
<p>Although the manufacture of cement floor tiles in China has not been long, they have been popular in Europe and America for decades. In places such as Cuba and Havana, there are those that were paved a hundred years ago, and they are still as new as ever, without any damage. In recent years, cement floor tiles are used more often than other materials in large buildings in Europe and America. It can be seen that the use of cement floor tiles is no less than any other paving material. As for rough and shoddy patterned tiles, they should be discussed separately.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, it has been twenty years since there were cement floor tiles. The market is depressed, and sales are sluggish. This is indeed affected by rough and shoddy manufacturing. Now Huaxin floor tiles have risen and issued in a downturn, and have been promoted by the architectural community. The speed of sales is surprising. If it does not have its own standing, how can it be like this?</p>
<p>Huaxin floor tiles are manufactured using non-fading pigments and the best white cement, using new steam pressure machines, the smoothest models, and extremely beautiful patterns. Each square requires a pressure of more than two tons. With such a novel method, floor tiles with accurate dimensions, smooth brick surfaces, solid texture, bright colors, and clear patterns are made. The cost is saved and the floor tiles are durable, and then immersed in water for a considerable time, and then placed in a suitable temperature to dry, and then become the ideal floor tiles.</p>
<p>Huaxin floor tiles do not need to be burned or baked. Most of the manufacturing workers are skilled, and experts are hired to supervise from time to time. Therefore, the quality of the products is the best in the industry. Huaxin floor tiles with eight-inch squares are the most common, and four-inch squares, six-inch squares, and four-inch and eight-inch squares are also quite popular. Among them, there are two types: patterned and plain. They are most suitable for public places, banks, hotels, theaters, apartments, school hospitals, classrooms, and living rooms, corridors, platforms, and bathrooms in city houses.</p>
<p>Huaxin floor tiles are sold widely and spread to various ports. The quality of their products can be imagined. In addition to the major buildings in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Jiangxi last year, the International Friendship Club and the new houses of the Supervisory Committee of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, which are currently under construction, also use the company's products, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Visit to the Dazhong Brick and Tile Factory <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>This reporter believes that Shanghai's architecture is changing with each passing day, and that the high-rise buildings are new and stylish, almost comparable to Europe and America, and that the inner methods of the past know that the bricks and tiles that occupy an important part of the building materials must be gradually improved to adapt to the needs of the times. Therefore, there is a desire to visit one with a larger scale and better equipment. Fortunately, my friend Mr. Zhang has a good relationship with Mr. Zhu Hongxin, the manager of Dazhong Machine-made Brick and Tile Company, and specially entrusted him to introduce him and express his welcome. So in the bright spring light, he accompanied three people to Dongjiadu Dupu in Nanshi, took the car of Shangnan Transportation Company to Zhoupu in Nanhui County, and then took a connecting ferry south for an hour to reach the destination of Xiasha Tiexiang. Soon after landing, looking eastward, he saw towering chimneys, winding blue smoke, and workshops and factories arranged like scales and compared. Colleagues pointed remotely and said that this is probably the Dazhong Brick and Tile Factory, which is famous in Shanghai. Walking east, turning west and heading south, crossing the bridge to the factory, the stockpiles of goods were piled up, and the types were diverse. After another mile or so, he arrived at the office and sent a business card to pay a visit and state his intention. He was greeted by the factory director Mr. Shen Binru, who politely invited him to lead the visit. After more than two hours, he traveled all over the factory. The factory is located in the southeast of Xiasha Town, surrounded by rivers on three sides, with convenient transportation. It is more than two miles long from north to south and one mile wide from east to west, covering an area of more than 1,100 acres, and the breadth of the area can be said to be unique. The factory is densely covered with railways, from raw materials to manufacturing, cooling, drying, firing, and stacking, and all transportation is carried out by this to achieve the purpose of lightness and speed. The raw material is the local sticky soil, which is transported, dried, poured into the mud grinder, ground into powder, transferred to the mud mixer to mix with water, and then pressed into the mud press to squeeze and solidify, and then put into the blank making machine to make various bricks and tiles. The power is a 150-horsepower diesel engine, a 70-horsepower steam engine, and five motors of different sizes from 50 horsepower to 20 horsepower. In addition to the mud grinder, mud mixer, and mud press, there are two German-style brick making machines and six tile making machines, which can produce 200,000 blanks every day. After the blanks are completed, they are transported to the cooling room for a week of shade, and then transported to the drying field for drying. The drying and drying equipment is fired in the kiln. There are several types of kilns. One is a German-style ring kiln, with a total of two seats and 64 doors, which are specially used for firing red goods. The architecture is grand, and the Chonglou is built on top of it, which is also used for cooling blanks. The remaining various types are various pottery trials and large water kilns for firing green goods, with a total of twelve seats. The fire is lit day and night all year round, so although the sales are wide, the cargo yard along the river, two miles from north to south and east to west, is still piled up with nearly 10 million. The river is the cargo yard on both sides, and in the middle of the two kilns facing each other is the river. The blank making room is to the east, and the raw material yard is to the east. The office is to the south. The north and south sides of the blank making room, the raw material yard, and the office are all cool rooms and drying yards. There are more than 340 cool rooms, and the buildings on the kiln are not included. The drying yard is more than 250 acres wide, stretching endlessly from north to south. Looking at its products, hollow bricks, Western-style tiles, imitation ancient decorations, etc. suitable for modern architecture are all complete. The eastern border of the factory is a pool with more than a dozen banks planted with peach and willow trees. The pond stores fresh shrimp and green waves, and the swimming fish float and sink. It is a scenic spot for workers to relax. The Zhougui of the equipment and the Hongtan of the building are amazing.</p>

<p>— Jingying</p>
<p>A few days ago, due to something happening in Shanghai, I was introduced by a friend to visit a China Stone Company that is purely domestic. The products are novel, the types of stones are various, and the colors are brilliant like woven brocade. I also heard that the internal and external stone materials of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, the Sihang Savings Association, and the Dashin Company Building on Nanjing Road are all supplied by the China Stone Company. The black feldspar used in the bottom layer is particularly superior to imported products in terms of material strength and luster. The Shanghai business office of the stone company is located at No. 310 Jing'an Temple Road. The founder is Mr. Yao Huasun. Mr. Yao has always had patriotic enthusiasm. In view of the fact that our country has abundant deposits, the Chinese people have abandoned them without development, but instead let the rough stone materials from across the ocean flow into the domestic market, which is a pain in his heart. Therefore, based on his patriotic enthusiasm, he made a groundbreaking move to develop the reality, and has worked hard to operate it. Over the years, he has made great achievements, which is enough to put a ray of light on the industrial and commercial industry of our country. Mr. is more spare no effort to study carefully, and the excellence of its products is especially rare. It is hoped that the Chinese people will advocate its application, so that the industrial and commercial industry operated by the Chinese people will not be affected by the downturn, open up new ways to resist foreign goods, and be a great fortune for the real industrial and commercial industry. It is also a way to block the outflow of wealth.</p>
<h3 id="e182">A Record of the Zhenye Asbestos Factory <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongchi</p>
<p>Founding</p>
<p>Zhenye Asbestos Manufacturing Factory was founded in 1934. The factory is located in Dachangyu Hutong, Special Second District, Tianjin. The factory covers an area of 1.5 acres with capital of 200,000 yuan, and is a joint-stock company with Zhou Jinting as manager and Li Xingfu and Wang Xingjiu as deputy managers. The factory employs more than 120 workers and has 40 machines of various sizes. It is the largest asbestos manufacturing factory in China. In the spring of 1935, it took over Tianjin Asbestos Company, China Asbestos Company, and Kuiyelong Asbestos Factory, and its strength became more abundant. Mr. Zhou and Mr. Li believe that domestic asbestos products were mostly shoddy in the past, and imported goods have been increasingly dumped in recent years. The annual loss is extremely considerable, so they have carefully studied, added machinery, and improved various products. The various products produced are not inferior to foreign goods, and have been praised by various factories, railways and the construction industry throughout the country.</p>
<p>Mining Area</p>
<p>The mining area is located in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province, and the output is quite abundant. Except for a small part of Sichuan that has not been mined, the national asbestos raw materials are completely supplied by the Zhenye Asbestos Mine. It has a mining license, and mining is carried out independently. There are often 300 people, in addition to supplying the needs of the whole country, the export volume is also very large, and only this mine in the country is being mined.</p>
<p>Factory</p>
<p>The factory site is large, and the entire factory is divided into paper-making section, weaving section, rope-making section, brick and pipe section, spinning section, mining section, elastic rolling section, engineering section, etc., and the writing room is divided into accounting section, general affairs section, purchasing section, wholesale section, export section, and health section. Each section has one material chief and several clerks, 80 engineers and 40 apprentices, divided into day and night shifts. All workers and staff in the factory wear Zhongshan uniforms, and all the equipment is quite large-scale, which is enough to show the spirit of the factory.</p>
<p>Products</p>
<p>There are a wide variety of asbestos products, which can be summarized into dozens of types, including: asbestos coarse and fine cloth, asbestos copper wire cloth, asbestos square rope, asbestos yuan rope, asbestos loose rope, asbestos coarse and fine thread, asbestos lead wire square yuan rope, asbestos various cloth belts, asbestos paper, asbestos magnesium powder brick, asbestos magnesium powder tube, various asbestos mud, asbestos ring pads, asbestos fire-resistant clothing, cotton gloves, boot covers, asbestos stove opening, wick, pillow down, fiber, etc. The above-mentioned rope types range from 3/10 of a circle diameter to three inches, and the thread and paper types range from 2.5/100 of an inch to 4/10 of an inch. The humidity, tensile strength, pressure, and firepower of each product are not much different from foreign goods, because the raw materials from the mine are very cheap.</p>
<p>Business</p>
<p>Business Except for North China, which is directly wholesale by the head factory, the first general distribution location in Shanghai for South China is No. 7, Lane 573, Dongxi Huade Road. The telephone number is 53547. The second distribution address is in Hannichi at No. 390, Funan First Road. The distribution in Nanjing, Guangdong, Qingdao, and Peiping, which are still in preparation, mainly deal in building materials such as asbestos magnesium powder tubes, asbestos magnesium powder bricks, asbestos mud (paint), and asbestos paperboard, etc., which are well received by the architectural community for procurement. This proves that the factory's products are exquisite.</p>

<p>— Fu Xueqin</p>
<p>Everyone in the industrial and commercial world knows that advertising plays a vital role in business competition. For every commodity manufacturer, every company, foreign firm, and store, advertising expenses account for the largest portion of their expenditure. We have heard many experienced merchants say that if you want to do 20,000 yuan of business, you should spend 10,000 yuan on advertising. This is indeed experience speaking. Because nowadays, there are many similar types of any given product, if you have a good product but don't advertise it widely, the general public won't know about it, and naturally, they won't buy your product.</p>
<p>However, advertising must also be done effectively to achieve the greatest results with the least amount of advertising expenditure. At the same time, whether a business can prosper often depends on whether its advertising is effective. Sometimes, even the quality of the product is secondary; modern industrial and commercial competition mainly revolves around the quality of goods and the effectiveness of advertising. Therefore, industrial and commercial enterprises put their heart and soul into advertising methods, paying particular attention to them. Most larger industrial and commercial enterprises have a dedicated advertising department and spare no expense in hiring specialized technical personnel to specifically study advertising methods.</p>
<p>There are many types of advertising, and the methods are even more varied. We cannot discuss them in detail here, but we can briefly mention a few important points.</p>
<p>First of all, the primary purpose of advertising is of course to make the public aware of the products you want to sell. In addition to spending a lot of money on advertising, advertising in various places, and promoting it through various methods, the main thing is to use concise and powerful language to express the characteristics of the product, so that the general public unknowingly develops a deep and lasting impression of the product. According to people's general nature, they are generally not happy to read long texts, especially advertisements that have little to do with the country or society. Too long and fewer people will read it; therefore, unless absolutely necessary, advertising text should not be too long; it is best to choose a few words of slogan to express the characteristics of the product, so that the general public can easily remember it. For example, "Bailing Machine has unexpected effects," "Mingxing Flower Dew Perfume gets more fragrant with age,"... are good examples.</p>
<p>Secondly, in advertising, pictures are as important as words. A good advertisement must vividly present the product with an eye-catching picture, and then explain it with concise and appropriate text. But there are many types of advertising pictures? Generally, we can see two types: flat and three-dimensional. These two naturally have their own advantages, but generally speaking, we can say that three-dimensional images are more likely to make people have a concrete impression than flat images. A certain German tobacco company produced a type of cigarette. They initially created a flat advertising image for this cigarette, which opened the cigarette box and revealed half of the cigarettes inside, presenting it flatly to the people's eyes; later, they created a three-dimensional image, specially taking out two cigarettes from a box and presenting them in a three-dimensional way in the image. As a result, according to research, the latter gave people a deeper impression. We can also feel this situation if we pay attention to the advertising images in newspapers and on the roadside.</p>
<p>Of course, advertising images not only have the expression of pictures, but also have text descriptions. Therefore, in advertisements with both text and pictures, the order of arrangement becomes a question. Should the text be placed above? Or should the picture be placed above? This, of course, cannot be rigidly stipulated, but depends on the situation. However, generally speaking, because pictures are better at embodying objects and attracting attention, it is better to put the picture above and the text below in general. If, in addition to the main text expression, you also want to use a few simple sentences to supplement the explanation to increase the effectiveness of the advertisement, then these supplementary explanations should be placed next to the picture, and the font should of course be smaller, while the main expression should undoubtedly use a larger font and be placed below the advertisement or in other places that can achieve the greatest effect.</p>
<p>Whether it is text-based or text-and-picture advertising, special attention should be paid to the target audience of the goods. Here I can cite an interesting fact: a certain hotel transported a type of wine from the inland. Some people initially advocated naming the wine Guifei (Imperial Concubine) wine, meaning that Yang Guifei could attract the masses; but some people opposed this name and advocated naming it Taibai wine, on the grounds that Yang Guifei was not as good as Taibai at drinking. "Taibai drinks a dou of wine and writes a hundred poems" is something that generally pleases those who love wine; the result was that the latter was adopted, and a statue of Taibai with a strong sense of drunkenness was made as the advertisement. This is paying attention to the target audience of the advertisement. In addition, there should also be distinctions in advertising for the elderly, young people, children, and people from various social strata, and cannot be generalized. Taking the cigarettes that people generally love to smoke as an example, the lower and even middle classes not</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>only can only afford to smoke cigarettes that cost a dozen copper coins a box, but also want to get a little profit from it, so recently many cigarettes of this type have small prizes (such as matches, soap, etc.), which is very correct; some cigarettes of this type do not adopt this method and state in the advertisement that they are unwilling to make such a waste, in my opinion, this is not recognizing the target audience. Conversely, high-end cigarettes smoked by noble people naturally do not need to take the method of giving prizes for smoking, because noble people do not seek those small profits, they mainly want the goods to be beautiful and noble.</p>
<p>In addition, in the competition of advertising, we must pay close attention to the situation of the business world; we must know the advantages and weaknesses of our competitors; we must be steady and not be afraid of sacrifice, just like gambling;... In this way, entering and exiting the business world, coupled with ingenious advertising techniques, the possibility of victory is very high.</p>

<h3 id="e185">How to Study Music? <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>According to the general public's view, music is a kind of entertainment, so those who like to play the piano, harp, flute, and flute are mostly considered to be people who like to play. However, everyone knows that sad music can make people sad and want to cry. Joyful songs can make people feel happy and crazy, and passionate tunes can also make people excited and nervous: these facts fully prove that music, like other arts, has the function of organizing human emotions and thoughts, and plays a positive role in our lives. For example, religion uses music to preach, the military uses music to encourage soldiers, and the state uses music to educate the people; more concretely, such as the great role played by the Marseillaise in the French Revolution, the Soviet Union's use of music in all aspects to improve the cultural level of its people, and Christians' use of singing to gather crowds to promote the doctrine of "Jesus loves me, I love Jesus," are all practical evidence. Therefore, if we want to study music, we should not treat it as a kind of entertainment to play with, but should study it as an art that serves our lives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is generally believed that studying music is nothing more than learning musical skills, such as how to play the piano, how to play the violin, etc. However, even if the piano and violin are played very well, if you do not understand the theory of music, you can only be regarded as a highly skilled technician, and cannot be called a musician. A true musician not only has certain musical skills, but also understands the theory of music, or can write songs and musical scores. Therefore, our study of music is not biased towards technology, but mainly studies its theory. The question of how to study music cannot be scrutinized in a piecemeal way; learning musical skills requires long-term practice based on many mechanical laws.</p>
<p>If we want to study music theoretically, we must first understand what music is and understand its relationship with human life. As mentioned above, music is an art; its characteristic is to organize human thoughts and emotions with harmonious sounds. If sound is a phenomenon of matter in nature and society, then thoughts and emotions are the product of human life, and not illusory and magical things. According to the investigation of historians and artists, in primitive times, music did not have an independent form, but was only a simple song or a harmonious cry of organizing labor that occurred in the process of human labor, which fundamentally could not be separated from labor itself. When human life had moved away from the primitive state to a considerable extent and became more complex, music could be formed accordingly; and its flowering period was in the Greek era when society had already had group divisions. From this fact, we can know that the origin of music is inseparable from human labor life, and it develops with the development of human life. Therefore, our central standpoint in studying music is to study it from the perspective of human life and the perspective of society; only in this way can we understand all musical phenomena. For example, the music of the medieval feudal aristocracy is combined with gods and religion, and its form is characterized by solemnity; and the content and formal characteristics of the music of classicism, romanticism, and naturalism since the Renaissance are the same as those of these literary genres; but these phenomena cannot be understood unless they are studied from the lives of the medieval feudal aristocracy and the developing citizens after the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Here we can also cite a more practical modern example to talk about the problem. That is, according to common sense, music emphasizes harmony and rhythm; the so-called noise has always been despised by general musicians. But in the new era of the twentieth century, with the emergence of futurism in literature, futurism in music also appeared. The former destroyed general grammar in creation, and the latter completely ignored harmony and rhythm in music, and strived to explore noise. They declared: "The art of music, in order to entertain our hearing with gentle harmony, has explored transparency, purity, and sweetness. But the current art of music is exploring the most chaotic, strangest, and sharpest mixture of sounds." Why? Because they feel: "In all our discoveries in life, noise is accompanied by it, and noise has a force that guides us to life. On the contrary, the ordinary musical sounds that have nothing to do with life, a kind of mutually separated sounds - become a more familiar image to the eyes, and too familiar to the ears. Unmusical and irregular noise hides infinite surprises for us. We are convinced that sharing noise (everything) and letting them respond to each other will enrich life from invisible joy." Such a strange phenomenon may surprise you. But, if we can socially examine the era and land in which futurist music was produced, then this strange phenomenon is not difficult to understand. In fact, such futurist music appeared in Italy, a young capitalist country in the new era of the twentieth century, as an artistic genre. Because at this time, Italy was a young capitalist country, where there were mechanical noises, the noise of streetcars and automobiles, and the noise of urban crowds, so futurist musicians had the object of "irregular noise"; also, because the living conditions of the intellectuals in young capitalist Italy were unexpectedly bad, and the citizens also held aggressive ambitions, so the futurist musicians, as a group of intellectuals, followed the citizens of Italy, were dominated by moneybags, and stood on the position of the citizens to vigorously praise machinery and express its aggressive ambitions. In this way, even such futurist music is not understood by us?</p>
<p>Secondly, we should study the musical theory itself. Because although music is a product of society, it has not lost its characteristics and independence as a result; on the contrary, to have its characteristics and independence is to have its meaning of existence, so that it can be understood socially, otherwise there is no way to grasp it. Therefore, after we know how to study music socially, we still need to study music theory, music form, harmony, etc. according to the characteristics of music. Naturally, the study of music theory, etc., should also be studied socially, because even the characteristics of music exist in its social nature; however, in order not to cause confusion, and in order to clarify the characteristics of the problem, it is still necessary to specifically propose the study of music theory itself.</p>
<p>The so-called music theory is the knowledge on the music score, such as symbols, rhythms, musical terms, intervals, scales, etc. The so-called musical form is the various forms of musical songs, such as sacrificial songs, symphonies, sonatas, etc. As for harmony, it is the study of the organization of sounds and the usage of strings. In addition, there are also the structures of various musical instruments, the history of the development of the instruments themselves, etc., which must be studied separately. Although these studies are somewhat close to technical theory, to be a musician, if you do not understand the rhythm, form, sound structure of music, as well as the names and structures of many musical instruments, it is impossible.</p>
<p>At the same time, because music is a field of art, the artistic trends of an era have an inseparable relationship with the music of that time. For example, the characteristics and tendencies of futurist literature and futurist music mentioned above are completely the same, which is a clear example; therefore, we study music not only to study its characteristics and social nature, to study its history of development, to understand its position in art, and to understand the roots of the musical trends that occur in each era. Otherwise, many musical phenomena cannot be understood in the general artistic trends, and the result is that the study of music becomes isolated, becomes unrelated to the study of art, and therefore the knowledge obtained in the study is bound to be imperfect.</p>
<p>However, what has been said above is only the points that should be paid attention to in the general study of music. Below this, there are many more special and specialized studies, which require more special knowledge and laws. For example, when studying the violin, in addition to having the general musical knowledge mentioned above, we should also study the origin and structure of the violin and its position in music, study why putting four silk threads on a pair of wooden boxes becomes such an instrument, and why the sound of the violin is so mellow and soft, etc. The same applies to learning the piano, etc.</p>
<p>In this way, is it not very difficult to study music and want to become a musician? Indeed, this is more difficult than the study of general art; in fact, how many Beethovens have there been from ancient times to the present? From this, we can see the difficulty of the birth of a great musician. However, we do not necessarily hope to become Beethoven when we study music, but mainly to learn a little musical knowledge and skills to serve society and to promote music education. Moreover, if we want a new Beethoven to be born, we must popularize music education and improve the general level of musical knowledge. As in the current Soviet Union, because general music education is very popular, and every effort is made to enable every citizen to have some musical knowledge and skills, many young musical geniuses have appeared there. Now, if we want to have musical geniuses appear, we should also work hard to popularize music education.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Talking About "Constancy" <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Wang</p>
<p>There is no such thing as "permanence" in the world.</p>
<p>People think that the individual can still be considered alive during the time when it is active, and the world mostly takes life as "constant," so death, which is its opposite, is "impermanent." In fact, according to the so-called theory of cell metabolism, we can know that not only is the "I" of last year not the "I" of this year, but also the "I" of yesterday is not the "I" of today, and not only is the "I" of yesterday not the "I" of today, but even the "I" of the previous second is not the "I" of this second. The cells in the individual are always following one after another, and there is never a "constant" to be found in this. Therefore, when a person dies, his relatives, friends, or other more related people are often shocked by this "impermanent" scene, but no one pays attention to the fact that the person is dying at every moment.</p>
<p>There is no feast in the world that does not end, things change, and stars move, within a hundred years, the sea of ​​yesterday will now be plowed into mulberry fields. Nature is like this, how can human affairs be unique? Therefore, after seeing these things that the Buddhists call "impermanent," no matter how emotional you are as a poet or writer, you will not be able to keep up with the sighs.</p>
<p>In the end, human emotions are mostly calm. Many extraordinary stimuli in life end up with the calm lake of the heart no longer rising with turbulent waves because people are used to seeing flowers, plants, reds, and greens. However, this is hidden, not disappeared. You only need to look at deep and experienced people, who often cannot help but feel lost and sentimental at every victory, and you can know this. Cao Mengde was indeed a hero of the world, but when he was composing poetry on the piled spears, he could not help but feel sad from it?</p>
<p>Although, there are still many people in the world who live muddled and carefree lives. In the play Great Hotel, travelers from all over the world come and go, trying to gain profit, with joys, sorrows, partings, and reunions, making the grand hotel like a grand theater. As one tragic or comedic scene after another is played, the front of the grand hotel is still as busy as usual, with cars flowing like water and horses like dragons. But in this busy state, the rehearsal of the second act of tragedy or comedy is being conceived, and the performances that follow are emerging one after another. In this huge grand hotel, there are no fewer than hundreds or thousands of people, and only one calm and observant mysterious and strange doctor is constantly sighing about this impermanent human world.</p>
<p>Because the human world is impermanent, there is "human suffering." It is precisely because the human world inevitably has various pains that cannot be treated by material things, that art and religion are produced. Therefore, Shirakawa Hakumura said: Literature and art are symbols of depression.</p>
<p>The politics and economy of a country are also constantly changing in the process of impermanence. The facts are very obvious, and we do not need to go far to the Tang and Yu dynasties. Even by picking up current affairs, there are good examples: stores that operate normal businesses collapse like ice cubes in the vortex of impermanence, while only companies and commercial firms that operate prize ticket businesses have the prosperity to carry on the past and open up the future. Therefore, the business that the people of the country regard as a matter of pennies and ounces, its future is also very impermanent.</p>
<p>However, according to the above, there are many grammatical errors, because politics and economics have a proper trajectory to follow in the process of history, and these can only be regarded as "abnormal" phenomena.</p>
<p>It is said that this time is again a "time of emergency." The time of emergency is exactly what our esteemed neighbor is shouting about all day long. For the preparation of the time of emergency, they do not hesitate to destroy the principles and regulations. What a sharp cry that is! However, looking around, it is as if a derailed train is falling from the abyss of abnormality and abnormality!</p>
<p>"Emergency" and "abnormal" both belong to "impermanence," because their opposite "constancy" is the same.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Storytelling Masters <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Wu</p>
<p>"Storytelling," is originally a kind of folk art, but because it doesn't quite appeal to the literati class, it's been regarded as a "trivial skill" and "not worth mentioning." In fact, we only need to step into any "storytelling venue" to see the audience to know that its potential power is enough to make you say "great!"</p>
<p>The most popular place for "storytelling" is Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and Shanghai and Suzhou are even more lively. Secondly, it is also very popular in the Yangtze River basin and the northern regions. Of course, there are many "story fans," but compared with Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, it seems to be a bit inferior. Storytelling is called "tanci" in Suzhou, "storytelling" in Shanghai, Beijing, Hangzhou, Ningbo and other places, and "xiangsheng" in the north. As for the Yangtze River basin such as Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan and other provinces, some call it "storytelling" and some call it "telling old tales." Since the name of storytelling varies from place to place, the "storytelling techniques" are also different.</p>
<p>Suzhou's "storytelling" mostly uses "pipa" accompaniment. Sometimes the storyteller is a "double act," and sometimes it is a "single act." The lyrics of the story are either told directly from the original book, or new lyrics are created. In terms of storytelling skills, it all depends on the display of each person's talent. The appropriate use of jokes and banter makes the audience feel as if they are there, forgetting themselves. When "one episode" of the story is finished, they still feel that there is "still an aftertaste" and don't want to leave. There are indeed quite a few storytelling talents like this in Suzhou. In Shanghai, such as the "Oriental Storytelling Theater" and various teahouses, although some storytelling talents are prominent for a while, they all come from Suzhou after all, which is not surprising.</p>
<p>The "xiangsheng" in the north is slightly different from the tanci in the south, that is, one only "speaks" and "acts" but does not "sing," and the other only "speaks" and "sings" but does not "act." Although the "xiangsheng" in the north was as popular as storytelling in Suzhou for a while, the talent is not as "prolific" as in Suzhou. However, according to the elders in the storytelling circle in Suzhou, although storytelling in the south is more common than before, there is still a tendency for "each generation to be inferior to the previous one" in terms of talent. Because in the past, people who learned storytelling mostly put in hard work in classical studies, so when telling stories, they could use the words and sentences quite freely. Moreover, many people did not intend to take "storytelling" as a profession at first, so most of them "did not respect teachers," and only relied on their own talent to perform. However, the situation is different now. Recently, some up-and-coming storytellers haven't even figured out many words in the books, and they still want to "debut" without knowing their own limitations. On the one hand, some elders in the storytelling circle, seeing that they are getting older, are afraid that their life's work cannot be "passed on," so they casually accept one or two apprentices to inherit their "mantle." On the other hand, there are many frustrated storytellers who have learned a lot of "skills," but their fate is not good, and they have been unknown all their lives, so they want to create one or two outstanding apprentices to "show off" and help them regain some face. But there is also a kind of storyteller who, because their own life is not easy to solve, also takes in one or two apprentices to collect a "tuition fee."</p>
<p>Learning storytelling and worshipping a teacher is like learning Peking opera. Most of them start learning from a young age. Although there are some "self-taught" people, they are a very small minority. A friend of mine's child was introduced to worship a storyteller as a "master." The "tuition fee" was one hundred yuan, and a table of wine was prepared to invite the "master." At the banquet, the introducer helped the friend write a "formal apprenticeship contract." The procedure was completed like this. The term of study is three years. After the term expires, the master will introduce the apprentice to "debut" or "partner" with the master. However, there are also apprentices who have studied for three years and their "skills" are still not "up to par," and the master can ignore the apprentice's future. There is also another kind of storyteller who does not necessarily need any "tuition fee" to accept apprentices, and teaches apprentices in the same way. However, this kind of apprentice has no freedom. As the saying goes, "Once a teacher, always a father." All actions after worshipping the teacher must be decided by the master. Apprentices who pay to worship a teacher are just buying "skills." Their actions are extremely casual, and the master does not restrain them at all. Every day "learning skills," the master first sets a time, and most of them are in the afternoon, because storytellers have a habit of using day as night. They are unwilling to get up before three o'clock in the afternoon every day. When learning, the apprentice first copies a "blueprint," and memorizes the words and sentences on it like reading in school. Then the master teaches sentence by sentence like teaching Peking opera, with rhythm and cadence. Most storytellers have many hobbies. In addition to liking to sleep late, eating opium is also indispensable. Therefore, teaching apprentices to learn storytelling is mostly in front of the opium shop, taking a puff of opium and teaching a few sentences. By the time more than a dozen sentences of the book are taught, almost one or two hours have been spent. With this slow and perfunctory teaching method, an apprentice often follows him for three years, but has not learned three books. Many mediocre storytelling talents today are made in this way.</p>
<p>When storytelling first "debuts," it is mostly "partnering" with the master, just like the "supporting old male role" in Peking opera, only singing some simple lyrics, just taking the opportunity to practice. There are also apprentices who "debut" and take charge of the show on their own without relying on the master's reputation, but there are still few apprentices with this kind of courage.</p>
<p>If a newly "debuted" storyteller can "draw a crowd" in a "storytelling venue" once, then he will not have to worry about being hired for three to five years. A "popular" storyteller earns at least one or two hundred yuan a month. Sometimes he also works as a storyteller in three or four "storytelling venues," which is more than that. Their source of income is either a net monthly salary or a "split." The standard for taking a salary depends on the reputation of the storyteller. The highest salary is about sixty to eighty yuan, and the rest, such as forty yuan or so, are very common. Those who do "split" split equally, calculated according to the income of the tickets. It is said that sometimes it is richer than taking a salary, but sometimes it is not certain. "Storytelling venues" such as Shanghai's Dongfang and Wuyuan are almost all doing "split." According to people in the venue, when business is good, a storyteller can earn two or three hundred yuan. In recent years, Shanghai's storytelling talents have been relatively developed, mostly because it is easier to make money than in Suzhou. Listening to a story in Suzhou costs at most one or two hundred coins, including tea money. The teahouse gives the rest to the storyteller except for the tea money. One can imagine how much a storyteller can earn in a day from this. Therefore, some famous storytellers in Suzhou have almost all rushed to Shanghai, which is covered with gold.</p>
<p>Speaking of the life of storytellers in the Yangtze River area, it is even more miserable than that of storytellers in Suzhou. I lived in Jiujiang for a while, and I saw that the storytellers there were miserably poor. I lived in Jiujiang for a while, and I saw that the storytellers there found an open space by the river, and placed a dozen or so long benches crisscross. Each bench could seat about ten people. In the middle of the space, there was a bamboo frame like a fortune-telling stall, with a teapot and a "戒方(clapper)," and a small drum. This was the layout of a "storytelling venue." The listeners were all porters who made a living by the mountains. After carrying the goods, they came to listen to a story. The storyteller was a tall, thin man with a complexion as dark as opium. He walked to the table supported by the bamboo frame, took a few sips of tea, and tapped the small drum with a thin bamboo pole for a while. Then he said a little "introduction" to the audience, and then took a few more sips of tea before "getting back to the point" and continuing the story that he had not finished before. The listeners all lowered their heads and listened attentively. The venue was really "quiet as a grave." Before half an hour had passed, the clapper suddenly sounded, and the storyteller stopped talking. He took a pair of bamboo baskets and walked down to the venue, smilingly saying "Thank you for your patronage" to each listener. Many people searched in their pockets, and for a while, all that could be heard was the clanging of copper coins. After collecting the money, he started telling the story again. In less than half an hour, he "repeated the process." I heard him stop abruptly at a tense part of the story. He told the story for a total of four hours, and looking at the copper coins on the bamboo frame table, there were less than two hundred coins. If you convert it into local dollars, it was only more than five jiao.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Biology in the 18th Century <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Xing</p>
<p>As early as the seventeenth century, entomology can be said to be quite precise; but in the science of life, no major changes occurred as a result. It was not until the eighteenth century that people began to classify organisms, and evolutionary views appeared in biology, and modern biology can be said to have taken shape in general. Therefore, if we want to study modern biology and even general natural science, we must know about biology in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The first person to classify organisms was Linnaeus (1707-1778). His greatest achievement was to sort out the many materials that already existed at that time and give them a unified naming; the current naming method of zoology and botany was established by him. He advocated naming the species of organisms with two words: the first word indicates the genus to which it belongs, and the second word indicates the species. He began to adopt this naming method in 1749; in the Species plantarum in 1753 and the tenth edition of "Systema Naturae" in 1758, he generally implemented his advocacy.</p>
<p>Linnaeus' classification is artificial in nature. As Kerner said, Linnaeus did not think that the classification of the twenty-four orders in his plant kingdom was its natural classification; he believed that the highest goal of botanical research was to complete the natural system based on the species of plants shown by the characteristics of the structure. But he only left some fragments and did not complete this so-called natural system.</p>
<p>The second feature of his research is the emphasis on the idea of species. Originally, Ray (1628-1705) was the first to introduce the concept of species in natural history, and he studied its changes. Linnaeus' research was based on Ray's research, but in his early works, he believed that species were fixed and unchanging. He believed that when the earth was formed, various animals were created, and the current species are the unchanged direct descendants of the original species. His position of fixed and unchanging species is an anti-evolutionary position, which only changed slightly until the continued edition of his "Systema Naturae."</p>
<p>Such a theory of biological invariance is combined with religious myths. From ancient times to the Renaissance and even before the eighteenth century, most scholars stood on such a theological position, thinking that all living beings now were purely descendants of past organisms, not from evolution. Of course, there were evolutionary views in ancient times, but they had no practical basis; the establishment of the theory of evolution cannot but be said to be a matter of the eighteenth and even the nineteenth century. We know that the theory of evolution in the modern sense should first be attributed to Lamarck's (1744-1829) theory of variation, the theory of use and disuse, but Lamarck was a figure active in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; his predecessors, we can cite Erasmus Darwin (1731-1802) and the poet Goethe (1747-1832), but these two were also figures who lived from the eighteenth century to the beginning of the nineteenth century. Therefore, we say that the beginning of evolutionary thought was in the eighteenth century: this is what we must pay special attention to when talking about biology in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>The sprouting of evolutionary thought can first be seen in the writings of Buffon, who lived in the same era as Linnaeus. From studying many animals, he got the hint that organisms would change due to various reasons such as weather and geography. From the result of comparing various organisms in terms of their system, he knew that there was a common general plan existing in all organisms, and humans were of course no exception. This means that the natural environment can affect the organizational changes of organisms; the current</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>The life of living things has been changed and evolved, not in such a form from ancient times.</p>
<p>Secondly, the great poet Goethe mentioned the idea of evolution in his "Metamorphosis of Plants" in 1790. When studying the organs of organisms, he specially compared the various organs of each organism, so that he came to the conclusion that the organs of each organism gradually became true due to the influence of the environment; finally, he hinted that the origin of all species conforms to the theory of evolution.</p>
<p>But in this era, the person who integrated the theory of evolution can be said to be Erasmus Darwin, the grandfather of Charles Darwin. In his book "Zoonoma" in 1794, he explained that organisms were not exactly the same as they are today at the beginning, and the shape of today's organisms is the result of gradual evolution. He believed that organisms change with the environment; all kinds of organisms have close blood relations, and the similarities shown between human arms and bird wings show this blood relationship between organisms, and show that all organisms have the same ancestor.</p>
<p>Finally, what should be said is the development of physiology at that time, which is closely related to biology in the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>Physiology can be said to have developed from anatomy. Anatomy can show the complex structure of animals and plants, but when we understand these complex structures, we will inevitably have such questions: What are these organs and tissues for? What role do they actually play? The answer to this question is physiology. Therefore, physiology can be said to supplement anatomy.</p>
<p>Originally, the physiology of animals and plants had been studied since the time of Aristotle, but it was in the eighteenth century that physiology became an independent discipline from anatomy. The person worth noting here is Haller (1708-1777). Based on his own observations and experiments, he organized a huge physiological system, and discovered the fundamental phenomenon of life in the so-called irritability; the result of his experiments further discovered that irritability is in the muscles and sensitivity is in the nerve elements. In this way, he was considered a pioneer in recognizing the autonomy of life.</p>
<p>The above is a general description of biology in the eighteenth century. Of course, the real completion and development of modern biology, strictly speaking, was in the nineteenth century after Lamarck was born, but the growth of biological classification, evolutionary thought, and physiology in the eighteenth century, as mentioned above, stands in a very important position in the development of modern biology and even natural science.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Speaking Without Lying <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Chen</p>
<p>The so-called telling the truth means that we speak without lying, and are completely able to tell the facts as they are, and express them absolutely faithfully, without adding any fabrication or forgery. Such a way of speaking seems to be generally considered the best and in accordance with morality by society, and it is also easy for everyone to do. In fact, it is not so. If you examine this issue from a philosophical point of view, telling the truth is a very difficult thing. Even if you examine this issue from the perspective of social science, telling the truth is not always in accordance with moral law.</p>
<p>The reason is very clear. If we only argue from a subjective point of view, the so-called telling the truth means telling what you see and think in your heart as it is, and this is considered telling the truth, and it is also easy to do. However, if we look at it from an objective point of view, the so-called truth must be able to express the reality of the real situation, and be able to explain the essence of real objective things, otherwise it cannot be considered the truth. In terms of such truth, in the field of philosophy, only the philosophy of materialism has been quite capable of telling the truth, and only modern new materialism can completely tell the real truth. As for all subjective, objective, and even dualistic idealistic philosophies, they are not telling the truth. Because in the real and true view of the universe, that is, in the view of the universe that can show the true essence of the universe and its development process, matter originally has self-existing reality, and human beings and their thinking are based on objective matter. Thinking is produced by the way of feeling through the method of experience, which reflects objective real things. Because thinking is the development, movement, and action of matter in the real world, the original laws and even the concepts of things existing in the process of thinking, if they are correct and can explain real things, then they must be reflections, conversions, and transpositions of objective reality, rather than subjective fictional fantasies. However, only materialistic philosophy can make such observations and explanations. In the eyes of idealists, it is just the opposite. In their words, matter originally existing in the objective world, they insist that it only exists in the subjective mind or feeling. Without my mind, there is no matter, and external objects do not exist. Originally, matter is the mother of mind, and existence produces thinking, but they say that mind is the mother of matter, and thinking produces existence, or that mind and matter are unrelated and exist independently. Matter and mind are two independent worlds and are discarded, and mind is not produced by matter. Thinking was originally to pass through the outside world through the sensation, and to obtain it through the method of experience, but they insisted that thinking is the revival of self-sufficient innate concepts, or at most just the synthesis of sensory elements within the subjective sensory bay, and is not a reflection of the outside world. All principles, laws, and concepts of things are grown up in the heart. From this point of view, the words spoken by idealistic philosophy can no longer express the true situation of the world, nor can they show the true process of the universe's development from the natural to the social and finally to the thinking. Saying that matter exists is saying that matter does not exist; saying that matter is knowable is saying that matter is unknowable; saying that thinking is produced by existence is saying that existence is produced by thinking, or that thinking exists independently; saying that the principles, laws, and concepts obtained from the objective world are self-created things of the mind, these are not telling the truth, but a kind of fantasy, a fabricated lie.</p>
<p>As for metaphysical materialists, although they also admit the objectivity of matter itself and real existence in the fundamental premise, and admit that thinking is produced by existence, this can be regarded as a kind of honest philosophical speech that can show the essence of the world, and there is no lying. But their honest words are also not very complete, because they can only honestly explain static and individual real things, but cannot tell the true situation of the dialectical and historical process of the universe. It is not so in the new materialism. It not only admits that matter itself exists and is knowable: it admits that thinking is produced by existence and that the subjective belongs to the objective: all principles, laws, and concepts must be obtained through feeling and experience before they can become reflections and conversions of the outside world; and that the real world is dialectical, and it uses dialectical thinking methods to understand and explain it. Because of this, if telling the truth is to be able to truly explain the true appearance of reality, and to explain it exactly as the real world is without fabricating, adding, or subtracting, then the speech of idealistic philosophy is not telling the truth, and according to its thinking and methods, it cannot tell the truth. The metaphysical materialistic philosophy only tells part of the truth, and according to its thinking and methods, it cannot tell the complete truth. Only new materialism, its own is the most complete truth, and only according to its point of view and method can it tell the most complete and perfect truth.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot say that human beings have never told a little truth, nor can we imagine that any era can tell an eternally perfect truth. Because telling the truth is also subject to the limitations of time and space, and we cannot tell the kind of complete truth that we subjectively want to tell. In the historical process, if human beings want to be able to tell some real honest words that can show the essence of the objective world, first of all, it is related to the development of human beings' correct scientific knowledge. Primitive and semi-civilized human beings do not have a clear understanding of nature and society, so they say that all things are created by gods, or that the sun, moon, wind, clouds, rain, etc. are gods themselves; the happiness and misfortune of human social life are determined by fate in the dark. Such sayings are myths, lies, not telling the truth. However, when modern science is developed, people no longer say that the sun, moon, stars, and constellations are gods, but say that they are natural things; some people have been able to analyze in their life process that the pain they suffer is due to economic and social relations, and no longer say that it is determined by fate. Such a statement is more able to express the real situation of the real state.</p>
