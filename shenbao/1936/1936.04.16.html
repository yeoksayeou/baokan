<p>為期四月竄擾二十餘縣西竄滇境希與朱徐合股</p>
<p>貴阳通訊、蕭賀股匪、於今年一月四日、由湘　竄陷玉屏、爲竄黔之始、至四月二日、全部由盤縣西竄入滇、爲期四月、其竄　經過及竄滇企圖如何、當爲社會人土所注意、爰將數月來黔省剿匪軍事概述如下、</p>
<p>竄黔匪眾　簫賀股匪於去年十一月問、在湘西突出封鎖綫後、損失極大、乃將各股縮編、計賀龍僞二軍團的三師、每師三團、蕭克僞第六軍團的二師、每師三團、共的十五團、人數在二厲左右、槍不足萬枝、此爲該匪入黔時之實在力量、</p>
<p>國軍配備　是時駐黔剖隊、有郝夢齡·郭思演·兩縱隊、共轄四個師、及担任城防之少數部隊、防禦軍事、配備在烏江及川黔路一帶、由郝縱隊担任、貴東路至湘黔邊境一帶、由郭縱隊担任、距離遙遠、軍力單薄、惟是時援軍部隊離開太遠、只能如此配備、匪犯玉屏後、卽欲西犯岑鞏、因鎭遠一帶、國軍佈置嚴密、乃經朱家塲北向江口、賀匪則另率所部西向石汗、</p>
<p>圍剿經過　是時追剿軍李覺陶廣兩部、由玉屏跟蹤迫擊、蔣在珍師由銅仁出擊、樊崧甫師由鳳凰松桃追擊、匪不能依照原定計劃、竄回老巢、簫匪乃率部佯向印仁北竄、誘追剿軍趨江口、賀匪則於一月二十日由石阡率部向西急竄、被國軍二十三師在龍溪截擊、惟因軍力單薄、卒被突破、於二十四日竄陷甕安、二十五日竄陷平越、專員轟洸殉難、城內被其刦掠一空、此時郭縱隊所部、巳由鎭遠黃平餘慶之綫、回師貴陽、賀匪乃以全部出馬坪塲、希圖擊破郭縱隊所部、然後西犯貴陽、至二十六日晨九時、該匪與郭部開始接觸、激戰終日、肉搏三决、幸將該匪擊潰、得全部通過、扼守貴定龍里一帶耍嗌、而貴陽亦賴是保全、</p>
<p>轉竄黔西　匪受挫折、計不得逞、遂由西北之烏當水田壩虎塲羊塲方面、分頭西竄、是時僅有保安團二營之衆守扎佐、結果、營連長以下死傷殆盡、至卅日、扎佐亦陷、二月一日陷修文、匪由鴨池六廣渡烏江、於三日至十二日間、流竄黔大畢各縣、此時行營主任顧祝同、抵筑指揮、郭思演李覺郭汝棟各部、陸續跟蹤追擊、該匪四顧徬徨、一切企圖、無法實現、旋得僞中央命令、旣不能到達川南、亦化黔北、應謀赤化川滇邊區、但國軍追渡鴨池河後、萬郝樊三縱隊、亦由黔北兼程趕上、二月十四日、郝縱隊圍匪於打鼓新塲、三月四日、匪復被萬縱隊截擊於黔西、再竄畢節、又被萬郝樊三部包圍、經過數次激戰、殘匪不能再事停留、乃襲用其繞圈子故技、希圖引誘國軍到威寗後、再行回竄、或竄川南、</p>
<p>激烈戰役　匪衆此種詭謀、經軍事當局窺破、乃令楊森許紹宗各部、扼守高琪叙永、孫渡部駐防昭通威寗、匪小得逞、乃於三月九日回竄鎭雄、十日賀匪全部在得章壩與桃源之間、與萬縱隊遭遇、激戰一日、匪傷亡甚大、乃與蕭匪會合西竄、又被孫萬兩縱隊於三月二十一日至二十四日、夾擊於威寗宣威間之先頭山一帶、肉搏十餘决、匪傷亡在二千以上、爲自湘竄黔第一决之大損失、是時、軍事當局判斷該匪受此重大損失、必將趨盤縣、稍事整頓、再作他圖、同時料其將西竄入滇、乃將滇軍扼守北盤江一帶、桂軍扼守南盤江一帶、將封鎖該匪於南北盤江之間、匪於三月二十八日竄抵盤縣、卽感受危險、乃加速度急竄平彝曲靖附近、現已竄至曲靖昆明北尋甸、總計該匪入黔後、轉戰傷亡、較之入黔之初、其實力損失三分之一、</p>
<p>以後企圖　以目前情形而諭、匪之企圖不出兩途、　尋朱毛竄川故道、偷渡金沙江上遊、至會理與朱毛會合、　到迤西一帶、再圖回竄盤江、或黔大畢、但黔畢盤縣一帶、國軍均有嚴密佈置、匪决難回竄、行營顧主任因於七日遄飛昆明、與滇主席龍雲晤商剿匪軍事、此後剿匪軍事重心、當移滇川二省矣、（四月十一日）</p>

<p>— 蕭淑宇</p>
<p>馬博士第二種對策，是有限度的膨脹通貨，這似乎是給財政當局一個警吿，因爲根據他的三段論，主要的三種稅收旣然都靠不住，公債的抵押即已失去自然，不能繼續發行，稅收沒有，公債不能發，無法之中，只有盡量膨脹通貨，他的論斷，是否全般正確，且不必十分追究，然而以我的愚見，政府將不會以濫發紙幣為財政出路，其理由很可淺見，第一，自法幣政策實行以後，我國實己放棄銀木位，而探行外匯本位，一旦濫發紙票，是無異使共國幣毫無價値，而自斷其外匯關係，自毁共國際信用，自紙幣發行權統一於中交三行後，不但確立了國家的財政基礎，而且增巡了人民與國家的財政關係，增長了人民對於陝家的信仰，在這種環境之下，誰願濫發紙票，以自毀其對於人民的信用呢，我們試問財政當局會如此其愚囑，至於有限度之通貨膨賬，本來有此必要，因爲現有法幣之數尙不及十萬萬元，實在尙感寗碼不足，所以相當的膨賬通貨，是於國家和社會俱有好處。</p>
<p>以上對於馬博士的兩種對策，已略加評述，然則非常時期的財政，究以採用何種政策爲宜呢，在原則上財政政策應包含於整個經濟政策之中，與經濟政策不相謀合的財務行政，根本談不上政策，與錢莊和公司賬房之出納銀錢，沒有什麼分別，古人所謂『百姓不足君孰與足』，又云『民富則國富』，就正合於這個道理，我國古代的理財家，如齊之管仲，秦之商鞅，漢之蕭何，宋之王安石，莫不於此原則之下經理國政，近來政府一而改　財務行政，同時力謀經濟復興，而尤急急於西南西北的建設，我認為只要能够努力完成道種經濟建設工作，就算確立了非常時期的財政政策，在一般原厕之外。我亦條列幾點零星的意見，藉供財政當局與財政專家的參採和硏究，並以結束本文。</p>
<p>（一）實行經濟統制政策　目前我國之不易施行經濟統制，實受不平等條的的東縛，以及國際關係的限制，非常時期的對外關係，旣已簡單，自可暢所欲爲，至於統制的範圍，當然是多方面的，　統制生產，即所謂有計劃之生產，無論國有或民營，皆當從事於切需的生產事業，　統制消費，所謂消費應有節制和平均　統制貿易，這可分爲兩方面講，對內應公定市價，使各地物價平衡，對外貿易應歸國家管理，凡木國不需要和决需要的物品，皆可向外傾銷，以裕國庫收入。</p>
<p>（二）有計劃的鼓勵人民向內地投資　我國現有的資本，多集中於上海，和沿海沿江幾個大都會，一旦有事，不但人民於金融和工商業方面將受損失，而政府的財源，且遭摧毀，故應有計劃的將此種資本向西南和西北各省的都會與農村移動，或爲工商業的經營，或爲種植畜牧之投資，不過政府應集合金融和工商界的領袖，作爲有計劃的籌商和推進，徒爲紙上空談的宜傳，是無濟於事的。</p>
<p>（三）膨脹通貨以爲建設資本　從事非常時期的經　建設，非少數資本所能奏效，政府一方而應鼓勵人民投資，同時還需要廣大的資本，以爲國營及借貸於人民的資金，而這項資金的籌措，政府很可以直接發行紙幣，本來目前巳感籌碼不足，假如使法幣之數較現有者增加一倍，而專用之於各種生產事業，法幣的信用是不會减低的。</p>
<p>（四）實行食鹽公賣　食鹽爲人民生活主要的原素，故各國皆由政府公賣，我國鹽場多在沿海，一旦海口遭受封鎖，則人民食鹽將生危險，故政府應於內地爲大量之儲藏，並實行公賣，以維民食而裕國庫，</p>
<p>（五）發行救國公債舉辦救國儲金　國家當非常時代，人民均有救國之責任與義務，歐戰時與戰各國莫不盡力募集內國公債，及獎勵人民捐金救國，就德國說，人民不但捐欵，連有價値的財貨與日用之五金器皿，都在徵收之列，所以將來發行救國公債和鼓勵人民備金救國，當惟力之是視，</p>
<p>（六）借用外債　在理論上說，彼時各國均須自顧，誰還有此餘錢借給我們呢，不過將來我們亦自有其與國，只要我國四境不全受封鎖，就是借不到現欵，能借得着他人剩餘的軍用品和機器等物，亦是一樣的，我想這條路是行得通的。</p>
<p>本來國家非常的財政政策，是要隨環境而定而變的，此次馬傳士提出這個問題來，　以也胡亂的發表一點意見。（完）</p>

<p>總董在外僑年食之演說、所涉及事項、計共十種、爲（一）政治情形、（二）財政狀况、（三）界外築路問題、（四）交通問題、（五）人力車問題、（六）電話問題、（七）育、（八）工部局樂隊、（九）收支報吿、（十）一九三六年預算、關於前四項、總董所言者、均極簡短、茲特掇述其大要如下、</p>
<p>政治情形總董稱、本年除發生不　事件二决外、一切政治情形、可云無甚變故、而此二事者、幸亦未釀成軒然大波、是亦不幸中之大幸、一爲虹口日本水兵被殺事件、其始日本居民、對於租界警務當局處置此事之方法、頗生緊張之能度、所幸者雙方俱能忍耐從事、致誤會解除、國際間情感、　未破裂云、其他一事、則爲去年十二月及本年一月間、本埠中國學生界所舉行之示威運動、彼等受華北問題之衡激、故反日情緒、頗為明顯而緊張、且素來遇有羣衆行動發生之時、俱不免有暴亂份子及煽惑專家　雜其中、從事於不軌行動之釀造、此次當然亦不能居於例外、幸賴警方處置得宜、故雖與租界羣衆及界外羣衆之欲侵入租界者、歷生衝突、俱能控制解散、而未釀成流血事故、此則不得不歸功於警方手段之進步者也、</p>
<p>財政狀况、本埠財政狀况、的略言之、可云受世界不景氣之震盪、至今尙未有復元之望、允其對於失業問題、生計斷絕之人、雖無確切不移之統計、然就大勢而觀、今日失業情形、恐勝過前此而有餘、即如廢歷新年之中、大紗廠二家、至今尙在倒閉之中、失業工人、驟增五千餘人、此外華商紗廠、亦俱厲行生產緊縮、其他小型工廠、亦在一一收縮、瞻望前途、一時實無改進之望云、</p>
<p>界外築路問題、關乎此重要問題、總董僅稱、在去歲之下半年、交涉情形、巳見相當之進展、問題頗現即將解决之勢、不幸本埠日本當局堅持北區日本居民現在所付給中國電話局之某項費用、必須於訂的之前、先行廢除、此事當即由華方呈請中央示奪、而南京政府對於國家多故、正在窮於應付、此事或一時未暇顧及、而此問題遂不得不暫形擱置矣、</p>
<p>交通問題、據總董言、工部局警務處處長、於去歲假期之中、會久居倫敦、對於該處交通管理之方、多所觀摩考察、並調警務處要員一人、留駐新蘇格蘭場（即倫敦中央警務署）、學習交通管理事項、復據該警務處處長返滬後所報吿、英倫各大都市所感受之交通困難、俱遠勝於上海、此言頗可信、因自歐美各地返滬之獨立觀察者、俱如次言也、查滬上交通問題中、至感困難之一部份、即屬人力車問題、人力車之眾多、實為造成此處交通窒塞之一大原因、故一九二六年、工部局之委員會、即有將人力車數目、逐漸减少、以期十年之中、自一萬輛增至五千輛之主張、惟級居民之步行、或乘坐黃包車者、則視乘坐汽車者、趾高氣揚、不可一世之態度、亦不無疾首痛心之感、關乎人力車問題、後文復有詳論、茲不多　、</p>
<p>人力車問題、關乎人力車問題、總董言曰、本年四月初旬、車主擬以罷業爲抵制减租之圓、惟不久即吿失敗、其結果足使社會一般人士、對於此繫複困難之人力車問題、益加了解、而前此報章評論記載所根據之種種誤解、今亦已消除其大半、且目前一般人士、均以爲工部局之積極注意於此人力車問題、係　始於麥西氏之報吿書、實則不盡　、茲特將局方處置此問題之始末約略言之如下、公共租界工局部遠在一九一七年、即有爲改善人力車狀况、而規定人力車總數爲八千輛之舉、惟此項限制、不久即促成若干强項車主之專利、彼等不顧一切、惟利是圖、對於公衆及車夫之利害、均非所計、至一九二二年、承包問題、復成爲議論紛紜之標的、是年十月、董事會授命於警務處處長、使調查人力車是吾有公辦之可能、至一九二三年之一月、警務處處長、始有詳盡之報吿、據當時調查所得之情形、與此後麥西氏所報吿者、本無極大之出入、所可異者、當時調查公佈之後、社會人士、對於車夫之生活、並未引起深切之同情、此事經董事會審核之後、僉謂、人力車公辦、旣不可行、而車夫登記復難舉辦、以上爲當時之見解、不意十年之後、麥西委員會調查之結果、適與上述者相反、現工部局自設立人力車務委員會、以實施麥西報吿書中一切建議以來、亦巳二載有餘、其中最重之設施、莫如公用人力車夫之登記給照、蓋非如此、不能對於人力車務有相當管理之方也、去歲、　人承乏年會主席之時、亦曾論及此事、是後至七月爲止、公用人力車夫之經登記給照者、計共三萬七千餘人、此外自用人力車夫之經登記者、亦達一萬五千餘人、至局方處置此問題之困苦艱難、外閒多不深悉、惟十年前、當局所認爲事實上不可能者、今巳一旦成之、是亦差强人意之舉也、現繼續發給新照、正在進行之中，此事辦竣之後、人力車業之眞實情况、及車夫適當之數目、即不難得一統計、再則諸納稅人所已知者、卽自本年四月日始、車租知日巳又减去八分、夫東租究應减至何種程度、算固至不易而所根據之數字、容有尙須考慮之餘地、惟减租即所以减輕車夫之負擔、同時車主亦不至於感受極大之痛苦、鄙人言此、並非謂人力車問題、至此已吿一結束、但車主罷業失敗、事態自局方觀之、巳有相當之進展、惟瞻望前途、尙覺窒碍滋多耳、「再則人力車輛數目、車委會有隨時建議之權、現市上人力車爲數之多、確爲本埠交通上至大之問題、待此後董事會之相機處理者正多、惟車輛數目、苟减至供不應求之時、適足以造成車主之專利、及以執照爲圖利之具等情、故事先必須自减租人手、蓋减租者、一方面旣循經濟之原則、顧全車商相當之贏利、一方面且可防止專利及販賣執照等舉也、故在此事尙未舉辦之前、車輛數目之遞减、固不能期之過急也、總重繼言、「現　夫給照、旣　舉辦、車租亦已兩度低减、車樣已在日漸改善之中、而互助會會務、亦日臻發達、故此問題之處理、可云巳獲相當之效果、惟所云改組車委會、以圖經費之節省、則時期尙未成熟、但日後此事之應劃歸平常之行政組織、確屬此後應加考慮之問題、」</p>

<p>至人力車主之反抗、原無可異之處、蓋人類之心理、世界各處皆同、即在他國、凡有專利可圖者、其反對當局之干涉及管理、亦必至力、若以過去之經騐而言、在如此情　之下、欲取得一定不移之統計、以訂車主應得之利率爲若干、實屬極度繁難、但减租之舉、倘根據於不實不盡之數字、則反足債事、且對於車主所行之制裁、其是吾足以造成彼等對於車夫之報復行動、如此决之罷業等、亦應加以慮及、故在處理之時、其宜緩進而不宜急就、理實至明也、</p>
<p>電話問題、關於電話問題、總董首述此事經過之始末、如電話公司之要求加價、及採用按决收費制、去年納稅人會之議案、丁部局與公司之交涉、以及專家委員會之調查報吿、等前此俱已詳細披露中外報章、母庸縷述、至自本年三月一日、新章實行以後之效果、總董曾有如下之報吿、「按决收費新制實行以來、效果如何、固尙未有充份之時期、可加斷定、惟以最近情形觀之、通話之决數、巳大見减少、的在百分之四十五之譜、而前此所頂計减少百分之三七·五一節、今則超過甚多矣」、再則去歲電話公司因受不景氣之影響、用戶大見减少、但自本年三月一日新制實行之後、用戶即有多量之增加、此則由於商用及家用電話基本費用减低之故也、三月一月之中、用戶凈加達八百家之多、此爲該公司成立以來、空前之現象、並據公司當局所稱、現電話用戶所付話費、較前低廉者、的估半數云、</p>
<p>敎育問題、關於公共租界敎育設施一節、總董曾稱、數年以來、本埠受經濟之影響、財政狀况、一時尙無恢復之望、而一丸三一年頂定之敎育進展程序、遂不得不暫吿停頓、惟牛歲本埠日本學校補助費、會增加一萬元、而華人私立學校補助費、則增加二萬元、本年復以中日敎育界之力爭、致有日校一萬一千、華校一萬九千元、補助費之增加、至此租界敎育經費、已將達市政總捐及地價稅百分之二之最高額、除非財政狀况改善、局方收入有顯著之增加、敎育建設程序、一時恐無再見進展之望矣、</p>
<p>工部局樂隊、總董稱、去年六月、董事會曾令樂隊委員會調查樂隊是吾有改組以求經費節省之可能、以及是吾應保留與現制相等之樂隊、此事經委員會考慮之後、報吿稱、該樂隊應加以改組、即以現有範圍而言、改組之後、每年可節省經費七萬八千五百元、而該隊每年經費總額、可不至超過二十萬元、董事會鑒於樂隊之命運、繫於每年納稅人會之手、故循例對於該隊之存廢或改組、亦悉聽之於納稅人之自由處置、惟爲便利施行年會之决議起見、巳於事前通知各樂師、聘用合同、概以本年五月三十一日爲屆滿之期、而本年頂算案中、樂隊經費、亦祇有前五月之準備、故納稅人如欲保留或改組該樂隊、預算案即須加以修改、關於此事、本日巳有議案提出、靜待大會之處置云、</p>
<p>去年收支報吿、關於去年工部局收支賬目、前此已分別公布、載諸報章、而去年各部份支出欵項、較之頂算、節省達一百六十萬之鉅、其中警務處節省六十萬、工務處節省亦五十萬、惟電話專家之聘請、動用公帑達九萬五千元、是於局方亦不無損失也、而收入方而、去年亦短缺一百二十萬之鉅、至於臨時收支方面、去年亦經力求緊縮、故一切建設工程、俱不得不暫吿停頓、債欺亦不得已而緩行償付、統計之、收支雙方、尙可相抵、而不足之數、較之前年、相距亦不甚遠云、總董於此處、復陳述工務處處長哈柏、將於本年六月自動辭職、哈氏自一九零二年就工部局之職、一九二二年擢升爲工務處處長、在職前後三十餘年、當即由總董向哈氏預祝其退職後、前途幸福無窮、</p>
<p>本年頂算、據總董報吿、本年預算概略、本年收入、連上年盈餘廿六萬九千七百元在內、共計二千四百七十八萬一千元、較之去年約减少一百餘萬、此項短缺之原因、不外乎經濟之不景氣、致市上空屋日多、房租低减、而局方所收總捐、遂受極大之影響、即如執照費及公共事業收入、即因同等原因、而收入銳减、此外、本年敎育經費、共二百三十六萬七千五百兀、較之去年、增加九萬七千元、達工部局全部收入之百分之九五、至經常支出方面、除去敎育經費之外、需二千四百三十九萬七千元、較之去年同等數目、减少四十一萬元、以上數目、均係循極度之聚縮政策所致、即如警務人員、今已减至無可再减之限度、倘此後再加以緊縮、勢將造成或種之危險、再則其他各部事務、亦俱已逐漸减微、或加以停頓、總董復謂、上海之生活程度、巳受滙兌極鉅之影響、吾人所望者、惟中國政府所維持之外滙均衡、將促成經濟之復異、此雖亦係意想中事、惟工部局之預算、確已先受其影響、致一方面緊縮之效果、巳爲低滙率銷蝕其大半云、以上經常收支相抵、相差的一百九十八萬餘元、鑒於目前經濟狀况、復不得不提用準備金二百萬元、此項準備金、最近五年來、所已提用者、已達九百萬元、惟此金並非用之不竭、取之無窮者、故在不遠之將來、前此所徵收總捐百分之十六、或將不得不加以恢復云、更論臨時收支項下、總數所需、達一千三百二十六萬五千元、內有上年虧欠五百五十九萬二千元、此外臨時敎育經費、復需六萬四千七百元、各項重大建築、其可加以停頓者、已俱暫吿停頓、惟工作之已開始無法加以中輟、他如購地展寬馬路、不得不進行者、共須費用三百二十一萬九千五百元、此外復有撥付還僓及養老金等、共三百七十五萬三千五百元、至於收入方面、售地所入、極無把握、故爲平均收支起見、實不得不請求大會授權、舉行公債、或用其他方法、另籌的欵一千二百萬元云、</p>

<p>三國恊定俄方退出　去年一月間、英美油商、因鑒於俄商油遍地之輸滬傾銷、損失甚鉅、迨後各油公司如亞細亞·美孚·德士古·等、爲避免同業衝突、以保持遠東油業市塲、與俄國油遍地（光華公司經理）在各公司首腦部會議結果成立一個推銷聯絡制之協定、以謀統一售價、提高行市、迄己一年有餘、據確悉、最近俄商油遍地公司、認爲該項三國締結之協定太苛、在營業發展上、仍無形中受英美商之節制、不能儘量擴充其勢力、故已自動宣吿退盟、油價部份、則照外匯伸降情形而定、惟不若去年跌價傾銷之爲烈也、</p>

<h3 id="c159">上海之草帽業（續） <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之廿二）</p>
<p>出口商行。前因匯票升降　定。所負風險甚鉅。迨幣制改革。外滙安定。草帽市面亦趨平靜。今後營業。較為穩固矣。</p>
<p>上海帽廠。單製草帽者。通常規模不大。範圍較大各廠。出品叉規定不得超過資本定額。以免賤賣。顧以同業衆多。貶價競爭。依然不能避免。年來各大廠營業結果。每以草帽虧損。取償於呢帽。是可知草帽營業。近已無利可圖也。上海經銷草帽者。以前屬百貨商店。今則改趨鞋店。亦市塲之變遷也。</p>
<p>（五）草帽之銷路　出口草帽。向以英美爲尾問。法國澳洲次之。在民國四五年間。溫州蓆帽。巳有出口。數量不多。且假洋行之手。民十五年以後。革帽營業。日盛一日。以上等貨去路爲多。價值年達二千萬元。至民二十一年。出口數量。尙能保持原狀。但以市價低落。且輸出之貨。以下擋居多。蔴帽與金絲帽銷數。平均爲五比二。致所值退减。其後竟每况愈下。據二十四年度海關册所載。所值僅四百萬元，惟實際當不止此數。草帽出口。向屬免稅。草帽商報關時。爲便利計。每將各色草帽。混報蔴帽。因而共價值益低也。據草帽業某君估計。出口草帽。平均每年的六百萬頂。其價值有如下表。</p>
<p>民國二十年　二千萬元</p>
<p>二十一年　一千九百萬元</p>
<p>二十二年　一千二百萬元</p>
<p>二十三年　七百萬元</p>
<p>二十四年　六百萬元</p>
<p>上海草帽之銷路。以江浙爲最多。其决爲漢口厦門汕頭廣州等。華北方面。由天津帽廠供給。銷數微末。近年內地各處。草帽廠呈普遍之發展。良以紐織簡單。旣不需雄厚資本。亦不必高妙技術。其影響於上海草帽之銷路。則甚鉅大。上海草帽之銷數。素乏統計。惟吾人根據草辮之銷額。亦可知過半矣。按上海草辮最近全年消費量約四千包。以每包製造五十打計。則爲二十萬打。再加蠟綫製造及外貨進口。其數當近三十萬打也。</p>
<p>草帽外貨進口。實屬寥寥。蓋以國產品價廉。難以競爭也。他如拍拿馬草帽等。亦成爲經售商之點級品。惟據業中人云。本年日本紙帽。將有輸入。其影饗於市塲。當匪淺鮮。</p>
<p>（六）草帽之市價　草帽市價。自民十九年以後。逐步下降。一蹶不振。共原因的有數端。一，價值過高。按草帽出口行。在營業暢旺時期。恒囤積存貨。居　扳價。一遇市而衰落。易起反動。二，各國購買力薄弱。對於此項類似之奢侈品。力求節省。因此草帽銷路。大爲呆滯。三，日貨紙帽。意大利粗帽之競銷。出口行如不競銷。勢將無人顧問。四，我國存貨過多。不得不貶價出售。因此種種。市面呈長疲短俏之局。查玻璃草帽。在民十九年間。每頂最高售至十四元。今竟跌至二元五角。跌勢之厲。實所罕見。茲將民十九年與最近價格，比較如下（單位頂，元）</p>
<p>（註一，二）以普通貨爲標準（註三）以超等貨爲標準</p>
<p>內銷草帽市價之衰落。其勢不亞於出口貨。民十九年高貨草帽。每打値三十元。現則跌至十元。最低之粗草帽。每打祇售四角五分。若以高次貨統扯論。則現値市價。比之民十化年份。跌落百分之六十五强。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c186">復興民族與救濟流浪兒童　（二） <a href="#c186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— 雷震</p>
<p>全國兒童年實施委員會播音講演</p>
<p>救濟流浪兒童的辦法、就兄弟個人的看法、應有下列各種、</p>
<p>第一、由政府視各地生產情形設立孤貧工廠、收育孤貧兒童、敎以專技、使成年後在廠內服務為國家生產、如此則孤貧兒童、幼年得受敎養、長成後亦不致因失業而墮落、同時國家建設事業亦易繁榮、其利最大、</p>
<p>第二、由政府普設孤貧習藝所、孤貧習藝所的設置、現在國內各地多有設立·但是並不普及、現在我們的提議是每一城鎭凡人口在若干人以上者、必須設一孤貧習藝所、收養孤貧兒童、敎以當地職業所需之技藝、長成後介紹之於職業工廠、使能獨立生活、</p>
<p>第三、擴充現有公立孤貧敎養院、前面我們已經說過、現在所有的孤貧敎養院怕能容納的孤貧兒童、與流浪兒童的數量相差太遠、尤其在都市中間、流浪兒童　處都可看見、這不但於民族前途為害最大、即就整頓市容而論、也是大礙觀瞻、所以都市中現有的孤貧敎養院應該從速增設、設法擴充、其未設有者、應照前項辦法從速設立、所有當地流浪兒童、應由政府强制收入孤貧敎養院或習藝所、敎以技藝及知識、俾居年後可以自立、</p>
<p>第四、獎勵補助私立孤貧敎養院、私立孤貧敎養院逐步本業是社會私人的慈善事業、但是假若主不得人或是辦理不善、反而易滋流弊、而且私立的孤貧敎養院、因為是私人或團體的慈善組織、經費自然時常感覺缺乏、所以私立孤貧敎養院、應由政府按時給予補助、並隨時監督獎勵其辦理之成績、</p>
<p>第五改善繼承制度獎勵養子風俗、在前面我們已經說　、我國在宗法社會之下、國人對於宗祧觀念、異常注重、沒有子女的有錢人、往往借口沒有兒子、有子女的又借口兼祧、取了三妻四妾以求生子、也不受社會非議、但假若收養他人的子女以為已子、就受到族中反對、被收養的兒子、往往不得繼承遺產或享受與嫡系子女同樣之敎育，怕以在長江及黃河流域的各省、收養議子的風氣不發達、流浪兒童特別的多、另一方面在廣東福建等省我們看到一種收養義子的風俗、就是中產以上的人、即令自已有了兒子還是收養別人的子女、這種養子長成後、往往很能幹的替他的養父母掙錢、這種風俗收養者的目的如何、我們姑且不論、但是因為收養義子的風氣造成、流浪兒童便自然减少、所以我們談救濟流浪兒童、養子的風俗應當獎勵、同時輕視養子的心理和遺產繼承的制度應當改革、</p>
<p>經費很多、但是在舉辦以後、在初辦時、固然需要經費很多、但是在舉辦以後，孤貧工廠和關節藝所只要辦得好、均能有大量的生產、我們希望政府擇定方案逐步實行、同時希望各界能帮助政府、設法舉辦至如第五項獎勵養子的辦法、是並不須要公家的經費、只在私人能夠提倡就行了、總結來說、現在的兒童·是最近將之民族的生命、我們要興民族要求將來民族的健全繁榮、必須切實計劃敎養現時的失學兒童、猶須切實計救濟現時的流浪兒童、還有一點、我們要說明收養孤貧兒童、普通的觀念、都認為是一種慈善事業、所謂慈善事業、只是仁人君子在本分以外的隨意布施、或呆說是同情必的恩惠、但是現在流浪兒童這無所依歸、並不是流浪兒童自己作孽、社會這有流浪兒童、是社會的病態、是財產制度之不良影響、所以救濟流浪兒童、是政府和社會應有的職責、是一般比較幸福的人對於不幸福的人們應有的責任、所以我們要說救濟流浪兒童、不僅是慈善的布施、簡直是民族復興過程中我們國民應有的義務、（完）</p>

<p>— 紀國宣</p>
<p>明朝末年，國家內政糟到極點：奸臣，宦官，把朝廷弄得一場糊塗，皇帝本來就不是什麼懂事的人，加上這些人的欺朦，簡直變成瞎子一樣。裏面不健康，外面自然要閙毛病，於是滿洲啊，流寇啊，不上幾十年光景，就將明朝二百多年的事業，給打翻了！不過國家亡了還不要緊，只要人心不死，大家認淸仇人，總有報復那一天，所怕就是人人都希望常「漢奸」，人人都以為亡了國不過那麼一回事，那就眞眞完了，永沒有報仇的希望了。明代二百多年，只管叫讀書人作「八股，」考功名，弄得讀書人利祿薰心，還講什麼氣節，講什麼愛國心！只要有官好作，什麼人來了不是一樣？所以李自成不過一個土匪頭兒，竟能長驅直入，佔據華北數千里的地方，所向望風投降，叫人看了眞眞生氣！明朝最末一代皇帝到底為他在煤山上了吊，大臣們雖也有盡忠死節的，但大部分都降了闖王，卽如堂堂大學士魏藻德，甚至首先歡迎賊兵，闖王即位，率衆朝賀。賊兵將脚放在他頭上開玩笑，他都卑躬下氣的忍受，這還算什麼大臣？後來吳三桂為了自己的姨太太（陳圓圓）被闖王掠去，請滿洲兵進關，一下子就山河變色，我們漢挨整整受了三百年異族的壓迫，要不是人心巳死，何至有這種悲劇呢？</p>
<p>滿洲兵（即淸兵）旣攻下北京，分兵南下，眞是勢如破竹，明將死的死，逃的逃，降的降，誰能獨當一面，給淸兵一點打擊？當時本有一些愛國志士，擁護了明朝宗室福王由崧即位南京，打算像東晋南宋一般，來個偏安局面，無奈這由崧本是公子哥兒出身，只知吃唱玩樂，懂得什麼恢復中原，什麼祖宗事業！加之當時仍也是一羣混賬人當權，如像馬十英阮大鉞之流，都是刮地皮玩女人的好手，如何能做出滿人意的事來？不消說，雖有一兩個忠直的人，也就被他們排斥了如史可法，只能出守江北揚州，雖和淸兵作過劇激的戰鬥，可惜終於敗死，甚至連骨頭都找不到呢！</p>
<p>淸朝派了親王多鐸領大兵直打南京，福王只有來個「不抵抗，」馬阮之流，早已投降；即當時所派的江北四鎭總兵！劉澤淸，高傑，劉良佐，黃得功也都大半降了。福王後來竟被總兵田雄刦去，拿他送到淸兵營裏作為見面禮物，這個滑稽的朝廷所經的時間不過幾個月罷了！——這是淸順治二年（一六四五）的事。</p>
<p>多鐸攻破了南京，率兵東下，沿江州縣，無分大小，都在極短時期攻下。淸兵因在這一帶時時遭遇打擊，不日從前那樣順利，故而屠殺淫掠，無所不至；亡國之慘，可以說江南人士，都嘗試着了。而我們所要說的閻應兀，也就是抵抗淸兵最著名的一位，讓我先談談閻應元的身世！</p>
<p>他名應元，字麗亨，本是浙江紹興人，因他的祖先有在北京充「錦衣校尉」的，（這好比是皇帝的偵緝隊）故他的家也就遷到直隷（即今河北）通州。閻應元起初當「京倉大使」，原來自元代以來，南方的米糧就從運河北運，供給皇家食用，到通州下船，存入倉庫，故通州有很大的倉塲，也有管倉的官，名為「通倉大使」；糧米運到北京，仍要存入倉庫，管這倉管的官，就叫「京倉大使」。管倉本很可以貪贓枉法，從中揩油的，故淸代的混混兒有「吃倉……臥庫」之稱，即半指此事。閻應兀為人梗直，在他任內，力改積弊，涓滴歸公。明崇禎十四年，升為江蘇江陰典史；典史原是極小的官，只管縣衙門的緝捕事宜，和如今的公安局長有些相像；應元接任時，江陰縣令正在他縣兼代職務，縣中成無政府狀態。海賊顧三麻覷了這個機會，率了百餘隻戰船直入黃田港，意思是要估領江陰縣城。城內一聞這個消息，大家都嚇得屁滾尿流，瞪了眼睛沒主意。縣長旣不在，大家你推我，我推你，誰也不敢出頭。閻應元看了氣憤不過，又因職分所在，不便推諉，自己騎了馬，揷了弓箭，一直跑到大街上，虎一般呌起來。。</p>
<p>『來啊！好漢們！殺賊去！——</p>
<p>好漢們，你們隨我來，不要怕！——』</p>
<p>立刻千把人聚起來了。但是大家都赤手空拳，這如何能打仗，應元領了他們直跑向　家竹器行，叫道：「老闆！勞你駕，先借我們每人一枝竹竿，——這是大家的事，你莫害怕！將來我負責還這筆錢的！」於是一個人搶了一枝竹竿，權當梭標，出了城門，在江邊列起陣式，遠遠看來，眞如戈矛林立，風雨不透！應元騎了馬在江邊馳驟，氣勢十分雄武；一個海賊則從船上露一露頭，應元一箭射去，立時倒下去了，一會兒，又是一個，又是一個，三隻箭却射倒了三個人，顧三麻見了，只有一聲不饗，偷偷拔錨逃了。</p>
<p>這事惰馬上哄動全省，巡撫聽了，趕緊奏明皇帝，請求旌表他的功勞和勇敢，朝廷下令特許他打紅羅傘，鳴鑼喝道，一切儀仗，好不威武，小小典史，向無此例，那能不令人羨慕呢！但應元的運氣並不一分好，大家預料他一定要特別提升的，却竟止於改為廣東英德縣「主簿」而巳，主簿比典史，正是半斤八兩，廣東又離得那麼遠，應元的母親恰在病中，一時就沒有動身；正好這時局面全盤變化，崇禎帝自殺，淸兵人關，一切一切，改了面目，應元的官自然也就作不成了；而此時江陰縣典史已改派陳明選，應元便奉母隱居江陰縣的砂山。這已是淸順治二年了。</p>
<p>掀天的巨浪來了：福王被據、東南小朝廷的幻夢打破了，人心是何等浮動不安啊！但是，畢竟不容你苟且偷生了，淸朝的薙髮（即剃去頭髮，梳成辮子。明代人的頭髮是滿蓄的，梳成髻形，藏在帽中）。令頒到各縣了：意思說「留髮不留頭，留頭不留髮」，頭髮竟成了與腦袋不兩立的犧牲品了，原來淸兵每逢要攻打一城，就先傳一道檄文，叫人民剃髮，如果那地方人民依令剃了，便算投降，吾則進兵攻打，大行殺戮。這天正是閏六月初一，天氣陰沉沉的，好像眼前就要有一場大雷雨；縣學生員許用德聽說剃髮令傳到江陰，一肚子痛憤，心裏好似燃着了火把，他首先將明太祖的圖像掛在縣學「明倫堂」，招集了幾百個讀書人，一齊跪倒，他自已磕了九個頭，便呼天搶地的哭道：『想不到陛下辛辛苦苦從蒙古人手中奪回來的天下，又給幾個奸臣斷送了，眼見得黃帝子孫，又要做異族的奴才了』！這眞像一枝利箭刺在大家心上，立時爆發了全城人士的熱情，霎時間明倫堂就聚了上萬的人，大家眼淚汪在，滿臉心事，你瞧着我，我瞧着你，說不出一句話來，有的咬牙切齒，摩拳擦掌，有的放聲大哭，如喪父母。</p>
<p>許用德看見大家亂哄哄，不是生意，他便擦擦眼淚，站了起來，勉强振作精神，對大家說道：『列位，大明的天下，太祖高皇帝從蒙古異族中奪回來的大明天下，叉給幾個悞國的奸賊斷送了，國家亡了，我們漢族的子孫，要做異族的奴隸，要做滿洲韃子的臣妾了，各位，南京也失了，弘光皇帝也給奸臣賣了，現在虜兵已過江南，大好的河山，快被虜兵蹂躪完了。可恨那些守城的官員，平日食國厚祿，括民脂膏，虜兵一到，他們不是迎降，便是捲逃！現在，剃髮的檄文傳到江陰來了。列位想想，身體髮膚，受之父母，豈可毀傷？我們炎黃的子孫，豈可做韃子的奴隸？列位想想，難道我們就這樣坐着等亡國，等做奴才」？</p>
<p>大家聽完，怔了一怔，就有人大聲喝道，『他媽的！跟韃子拚命，咱們拚了！』</p>
<p>接着大衆就亂嚷嚷：『殺韃子：跟韃子拚命　』</p>
<p>『我的老命也不要了！』</p>
<p>『殺韃子啊！殺呀！殺呀！』</p>
<p>「不殺韃子，不算大明的好漢！『……』</p>
<p>大家亂哄哄嚷成一片，聲震屋瓦，也有好事的拿着銅鑼銅盆，在街上打着走，一邊走，一邊嚷：『滿洲韃子要來剃頭了，大明的江山快完了，不願做亡國奴的，大家跟韃子拚命呀！」</p>
<p>這一來，人就越緊越多，小孩子們跟着，仰起　子，睜大了眼和嘴；聽見大人們發瘋似的嚷，他們也一起嚷。許用德知道民心悲憤，就趁勢說道：『好！我們跟韆子拚命，死守江陰城！你們衆位有刀的拿刀，有槍的拿槍，沒有刀槍的，竹竿木棍，鋤頭鐵剷也行，我們大家要死守江陰城！』</p>
<p>『死守江陰城！』</p>
<p>『死守江陰城！』</p>
<p>大家一面喊，一面走，擁到縣衙門前，一齊喊道：『請陳典史出來，我們要死守江陰城！』</p>
<p>就有人飛也似的請了陳明選來，先將前後的情形對他說了。陳明選很從容的說：「大家的意思我已明白；我姓陳的也不是沒有熱血；但我的能力委實太差，無論那一點我都趕不上前仟閻典史，——他目前正住閒，難道大家忘了嗎？這樣大事，不去找他，誰還担得了他如今就在砂山啊！」果然這幾句話提醒了衆人，立刻羣衆喊起來，「閣典史！」……「閻老爺！」……「我們要請閻先生主持一切！」</p>
<p>第二天，淸晨閻應元已經隨了往迎的人來了，四十個家丁隨在後面，馬都跑得汗水淋漓。應元立時成了城中的領袖，他先對羣衆們表示了自己的意見，希望大家激厲良心，嚴守秩序。他當下就辦起公來：批閱了公文，規定了守城計劃，首先修治了各處堡壘，城垣；令每家出一個壯丁守城；——江陰城本來很小的，也不過萬把人家，千把兵士罷了。這樣，也就有了上萬的人在城頭守望，其餘老弱則專管輸送給養做後方工作。他又將縣裏所存的火藥火器全數移到四城城樓，分佈妥當。但這時兵餉却成了問題，於是應元招集了全城富戶，極力勸導，令他們輸捐。他說：「大家不必非拿錢不可；米穀，布疋，酒肉，器械，有什麼就拿什麼，須知這已不是圖苟安的時候了；但得多守一天縣城，我們就多享一天自由自在的福，作一天大明的忠臣義士；韃子一進城，你還想穩穩的做財主嗎？大家不要做夢啊一！國子監生程璧聽了，首先捐一萬五千兩銀子，這一下激動了所有的人，於是都踴躍輸將，不久，竟弄到三百甕的火藥，一千石鉛丸鐵彈，百把尊大砲，千把桿烏槍，一千萬串銅鈿；其餘糧食，酒肉，馬草，……也都堆集得山也似的。</p>
<p>給養不成問題，就開始分配職務：武舉黃略守東門，陳明選守西門，應元自守北門，一個把總守南門。而應元却照料四門，來柱巡視。此時多親王的兵已竟打到江陰縣，軍隊數額不下十萬，把一座小縣圍了幾十重，城外望不盡的營壘，眞是族旗蔽日，兵甲連營，十分使人害怕。</p>
<p>戰爭發動了，首先是城外用箭向城內射來，飛蝗似的，在耳邊嗤嗤的直響個不停。城裏也不示弱，雙方死亡的數目還不算大；圍城的兵見裏邊凖備得很周密，只得利用砲火攻城：道一個小小城垣，如何禁得集中的攻擊，不久，但聞轟隆一聲，原來是城墻裂了一條大縫；圍城兵士，螞蟻般爬上來，大家都慌了，只有應元沈靜着的下令，趕快摘取近處各家門板，用繩子串起來，先將裂縫擋住了，使外面兵不能進來，然後又將全城棺材店的空棺集中一處，都裝滿土，堵在缺口裏，於是連砲火也無效了。外面的兵氣得眼都紅了，又集中砲火打起來，果然不消半日又把北城攻了一個大洞，幸而敵兵還沒顧得上來，應元已令全城　人連夜運了石塊堵住窟窿。他說無論大小老弱，每人都要運一塊石頭，這法子很有效，人人不肯落後，頃刻閒城已修好了，等敵兵攻近城下時，原來仍是好城，心中暗暗驚異。</p>
<p>支持了十幾天，城裏的箭漸漸缺乏起來；閻應元忽然想到「草船借箭」的故事，心想：「我何不如法泡製？」恰好道時正是下弦，（舊曆二十日以後）月亮非到下半夜不出來的，他叫人用稻草紮成人，十個草人中間掛一個燈籠，在迷矇的夜色裏，將草人縋下城外，城頭上兵士們一齊吶喊起來，城外人聽了，一心以為城裏要去刦營，驚惶失措，不由己的放起箭來。放了半日不見動靜，方才罷手，直到天明，才知被人騙了。應兀一氣得幾十萬枝箭，心裏說不出的高興。他又在這一天夜裏，派了許多壯漢偷出城去刦營，那些淸兵，旣巳受過一次騙，自然不再防備，又加鬧了半夜，誰不想睡？但却想不到睡至半夜，忽然四而起了火，凄厲的喊聲，使每個人都心跳起來，黑暗中只有沒命的在奔出去，這樣一來，不光是被殺，就是自相殘踏而死的也要有幾千人！一直退了三里地才停住了！</p>
<p>指揮淸兵作戰的是漢人劉良佐，前面已竟說過，他原是福王四鎭之一，命他鎭守鳳壽一帶，（今安微）却不想淸兵南下，他首先迎降，如今反巷敵人殺目己的同胞了。他旣巳探明城內守將是閻應元，很想用利害來說他投降。他估量閻應元不過一個典史，只耍拿將來的地位一引誘，一定不會有什麼問題。於是騎馬跑到城下，大叫道：「總兵劉將軍在此，是閻府君的故人，請閻府君上城來有話說。」應元立在城頭，一看巳知他的用意；大駡道：『劉將軍，你認賊作父，現在還有何說？』良佐在下而說：『閻府君，識時務者為俊傑弘光帝（即福王）都完了，整個的江南不久就耍成大淸的屬地，大勢已去，你這一座小城池何必這般固執？閣下如肯投降，將來的富貴，在下願以身家性命担保！』應元聽了，氣得瞪起眼睛，大駡：『弘光帝命你鎭守江北，封你廣昌伯，待你可謂不　；你這全無心肝的國賊，自己當漢奸還不算，還要拉上我閻某嗎？須知我雖是一個小小典史，我却知道什麼叫國家，什麼叫忠義，不願只圖眼前富貴，落得千秋萬代令人駡為賣國賊的！可嘆你也曾是明朝臣子，如今引狼入室，賣國求榮，你照照鏡子，還有什麼面目見我們江陰縣的忠臣義士！」劉良佐半個字也回答不出，滿臉羞慚，乖頭喪氣的回去了。</p>
<p>形勢越加嚴重起來，因為淸兵又增加了援兵，大的這時長江沿岸，只有這一縣還在頑强抵抗，蘇州和松江都巳攻下，各處的兵都集中在這裏來了。起初還是用緩和方法，希望城裏投降。有一天，竟縛了兩個投降了的明將，跪在城下勸應兀屈服，這兩個東西，一面流着無恥眼淚，一面不害羞的勸說道：「大淸兵勢力强大，你們　瞎閙了；何必以卵投石呢？你們看，我們也不是願意賣國，勢到其問，實在不能作無　的犧牲啊！你們想想看！……』嘔得應元十分有火，大聲駡道：「你們這些怯懦的潭蛋！打敗了仗就該尋個痛快的死法，只管在我面前說什麼廣話！沒有你們這些丟人的東西，明朝怕還亡不了這樣快！你們羞也不羞！」隨即喝道，『守城兵士，還不快快射殺這兩個不要臉皮的亡國奴』，淸兵趕快搶護，巳經射死一個，只好將他們倆擁着走了。</p>
<p>後來又派人透出消息說，「只要應元肯將城中首先發動反抗的分子殺幾個，就可退兵，兩邊面子都很好看！」應元說：「首先發難的就是我，你們要有本領，殺我的頭好了，別的談不到！你旣來了一趟，我正式吿訴你吧，轉達給你們親王，全江陰的百姓，只有預備了「死」來和他對付，叫他不要再存什麼奢望好了，有本領只管打吧！」這使者狼狽不堪的跑回去了。</p>
<p>時候巳竟到了中秋，算起來從夏天城就被圍，幾乎有三個月光景了，居這一座小小城池，到如今還算明朝的天下。縱使强敵在外，到了這團圓佳節，豈不也在悲壯之中，給人以一種快慰嗎？應兀平時就極愛士卒的，有傷的親為裏創，戰死的親自哭殮，再加上一團愛國熱忱，那一個人不感激他，擁愛他，甚至受了他的感化？到了這一天，大家目有一番說不出的悲痛和痛快，應元也暗暗覺得一些高興，他分給了守城兵士們酒肉，另外還有賞錢，下令夜晚一齊在城頭玩月；大家聽了，喜歡得要瘋了：太陽下去了，一面晶瑩冷凈的月亮從海上升起米，照耀在大江上，照耀在城外敵人的千千萬萬營幕上，照耀在戈矛的鋒刃上，照耀在每個準備犧牲了的人心上，這是多麼嚴肅而美麗的夜景。大家不免痛飮起來了，一會又有人唱起沈咽幽凄的五更轉來了，（這是許用德新編的一首軍歌）遠遠應和了軍笳的嗚嗚響聲，和一些守衛兵士的絮語聲，這一個悲壯的宴會：這一個哭和笑的交嚮曲，也就是江陰城最後一個歡娛的日子了！</p>
<p>攻城兵士聽了這種悲壯的歌聲，又偵探了城裏的情况，巳知毫無投降之意了，於是决意下最後的攻擊令：兵十們都穿了精鐵的盔甲，拿了鋒利的刀斧，冒死的爬上城來。城頭守兵，也拚死抵抗，刀槍斫在鐵甲上，只聽一片鏘鏘的音嚮，刀鋒都砍折了。砲火更無情的射來，烟霧彌漫，咫尺不辨，從早至晚，也不知殺死多少敵兵，多少守城戰士，屍骸遍處皆是，各街巷皆起了沈咽的哭號之聲。閻應元見了，只有含着悲痛的淚滴，在城頭作最後的掙扎，一天一夜總算維持過去了；第二天一淸早，天氣陰得灰黯黯的，好似顯示着一種壞運命的到來，不久，果然下起傾盆大雨來。雨滴打在每個人的臉上，好像淚一般落下，城外砲聲又響了，似乎比昨天更密些，人又在雨中螞蟻一般攻上來；應元冒了雨，拿了劍，來往四城巡視。大家眼睛都紅了，瘋子一般砍着敵人，也被瘋子一般的敵人砍倒。喊聲就像一陣陣的轟雷，和着嘩嘩的雨響，簡直令人分不淸了。這種緊張情形支持到正午，雨還是仍舊下着，敵人却越殺越多了，砲火也更密起來。忽然，轟！轟！幾聲震耳的怪響，一道火紅的燄光，從城外土橋地方飛來，接連就聽見一片倒場的磚石聲，原來西城崩了！敵兵流水似的搶進來，守城兵士雖則極力抗拒，但經過一暨一夜的劇戰，已實在筋疲力竭，眼看被敵兵一個個殺倒了</p>
<p>這樣，死守了八十一天的江陰城在悲壯的犧牲中陷落了</p>
<p>城中變成一片烟霧，一片血海，一片凄厲的叫喊哭號！閻應元手下還有百十人左右，他騎了一匹馬，左衛右突，和敵兵肉搏的巷戰，大的被他殺死的也不下一千人吧，他本想衝開一條路直奔城門，跑出去之後，另設辦法；但等他到了城鬥附近時，早已嚴密的封鎖了，萬難走脫；他便下了馬，直奔前湖跑去，要踴身躍下，不想劉良佐因見他十分有才幹，務要生擒他，所以沒等他跳下水去，已被人抱住，將他送交劉良佐營中去了。</p>
<p>劉良佐駐在城中乾明佛殿，軍士擁帶着閻應元進來，他正在殿中倨傲的坐着，但當他剛一看見應元，不知是一種什麼力量，竟使他立刻走了下來，不禁抱起應允大哭起來了！應元見了他這副模樣，只投了一個鄙夷的微笑道：「好，我總算被你擒住了，不求別的，只要速死！好漢好是不怕死的；你哭的什麼」？良佐帶了他去見親王，本想替他說幾句話的，他應元却非常倔强，連跪也不肯，只瞪起眼來怒視着；旁邊一個待衛見了，一槍刺去，正中應元腿骨，立時仆倒地下！這時天巳傍晚，黑雲更加厚了，幾個衛士擁了應元，直奔褄假禪院而去，後來就再沒有人看見這位愛國英雄了。</p>
<p>事後有人聽棲霞禪院的老和尙說，那天半夜，只聽撲打的響聲，和一種尖銳的叫喊，說：「快殺了我算了！你們這些野蠻的東西」！這樣慘呼到第二天早晨，就靜寂下來，再也沒有別的聲息了。</p>
<p>陳明選呢，有人見他的屍身僵立在兵備道衙門的牆角下，眼珠突出，綱滿了紅綠，手裹還握着一把刀，地下染滿了一片血。</p>
<p>畢竟這小小的江陰城支持了八十一天啊！據說圍城的大兵，有二十四萬之多，死的就有七萬以上，城裏的兵士也死有五六萬，街上只見屍骸和血肉，幾乎沒有什麼活人了。</p>
<p>三百年之後的今日，還有人知道這幕悲壯的戲劇嗎？還有人能演這麼一幕戲劇嗎？　（完）</p>

<p>— 驊</p>
<p>我國電報電話所用的各種材料，差不多大半都是舶來品，每年漏巵的數字，很是可觀。本刋第五十四期葆貞君所著的「國產電料的商榷」一文中，曾有很詳細的論述，讀者也許還能記憶。記者覺得電料自給問題一天不能解决，不僅金錢的外溢，將永遠不能停止，國際上的威脅，也就沒有方法解除。在現在非常的時期中，我們似乎應該羣策羣力，把這個問題，作透澈的研究，以謀適當的解决。記者敬謹提供幾個些微的意見，希望讀者們指敎。</p>
<p>電料中最容易製造，而又最普通的，耍算各種印刷品的紙張。電局所用的去報紙，轉報紙，來報紙，貼報紙，公電紙，收據，電封以及其他各種印刷品等等，每年都有大量的消耗，這些紙張，採用國貨，均可應用。况且政府對於國貨紙張，早有明令通飭採用。可是實際上却適得其反。原來各種印刷品的紙張，都是印刷所採辦的。政府雖然規定必須用國產紙張，但是印刷所往往貪圖外國紙張的利息優厚，仍舊陽奉陰違。探購印刷品的人，旣非專家，當然無法鑑別是吾國貨。所以實際上政府雖然三申五令的提倡，國貨却依然滯銷。關於這點，我們以為紙廠與印刷業若是有切實聯絡，實行產銷合作。我想國貨紙張的求供問題。不難解决的。</p>
<p>其次，電局所用的藍白紙條及羊皮紙條。每年的消耗量，也很可觀，現在差不多全部向外洋訂購，若是一旦供給發生問題，那末電信交通將受何種影響！關於以上各種紙條之製造，並沒有多大困難，記者知道上海某紙廠曾經向交部接洽過承造該項紙條的，後來因為價格相差太遠，結果沒有成功。原來外國的紙條，大量出產的緣故，出售的價格，異常低廉，國內廠商當然無法與之競爭。祗好聽令洋貨在國內市塲上獨占活躍，這是最痛心一件事。記者希望國內造紙廠商能够與政府合作，設法謀上述各種紙條的自給。我想這事與各方面都有利益，一定可以很順利進行的。</p>
<p>最後要談到電局所用的各種機械，就記者所知道的，現在有無錢電及電力機器，國人都可以自製。但是各種金屬原料，却仍舊要靠外洋輸入。怎樣使金屬原料自給，這是今日急待解决的問題。但茲事體大，必須靠政府的力量，集思廣益，才有解决的希望。聞政府對於這件事非常注意，並且在着着進行。希望國內冶金家，企業家，各獻才智，為政府的後盾。</p>
<p>我國歷年對外貿易，都是入超，但近據報載：上年十二月份出超五百餘萬，本年一月份也出超一百餘萬，前途似可樂觀，但是我們細察出超的原因，就會立刻感覺到這種現象是暫時的，第一：華北漏稅之風甚盛，這種貨品，就占着輸入很大的數字，第二：這决輸出最大的數位是桐油，據說這是意阿戰爭和世界備戰的結果，將來局勢緩和，就會减退的。同時我們細察輸入的貨品，却都是些工業品。所以要平衡我國對外貿易，非努力提倡自製工業不可，電料的自給，不過是自製工業的一端罷了！</p>

<p>有許多大工廠或土產收買商為採辦原料或搜集土產便利起見，往往就原料或土產出產地開設工廠，或設立收買處，但上項地方之電信交通，未必已經完備，或雖已設有電局，而距離太遠，往返需時，不無缺憾！交通部有鑒及此，前年三月間曾有裝設商用電報專錢暫行辦法之頒行，其目的卽在便利，商行傳遞電報之用。‘惟此項辦法，係限定電報方面，最近為使距離電局較遠或未設市內電話各處之商行工廠，收發長途電話便利起見，又有裝設收發長途電話專錢之公布，自四月一日起巳經實行，茲將該項辦法之內容要點，撮述如决，以供參考。</p>
<p>請求裝設此項專綫者，應開具姓名職業及其詳細住址，向最近電報局或報話營業處聲請之。局處接受請求後，卽為估計需要工料費用數目，呈報本區電政管理局核辦。經核准後，請裝人應卽依照核定之工料一次繳淸，並預存保證金二十元，以便局處派工裝設。</p>
<p>凡在同一區域內聯合數家用戶同時請求裝設專綫者，所有綫路工料費，依綫路之遠近，按戶分攤之。用戶並得自備機料，填具聲請書，請求局處派工裝設，除保證金仍應照繳，工程費亦由裝戶負担外，機料費免予繳納。此項專綫經裝置後，除用戶自備之話機及其所繳保證金仍歸用戶所有外，所有所繳各賣及綫路，均歸交通部所有，槪不退還。</p>
<p>裝戶對於去話專力費及通話費等，仍應照章按决繳納，並須按月另繳專綫維持費，依綫路之長度計算，每一公里每月一元，不滿一公里者，亦照公里計算。至專綫裝戶對於來話之專力費，可免繳納。又同一區域內，裝戶在五家以　互相通　者，每月每戶加收交換費一元，在十五家以上者，每月每戶加收交換費三元，滿五十家時，得由交通部酌量情形，改為市內電話。</p>
<p>裝戶應將每日之長途話費於五日內付淸，如有拖欠，電局得於保證金內如數扣抵，並停止接轉來去長途電話，如停止接轉已逾七日，而不將保證金補足者，卽將話機撤除，所餘欠費仍須追繳。裝戶撤機時，所繳保證金，應於撤機後五日至三個月內，憑保瞪金收據向局處領取，逾期不再發還；如裝戶將收據遺失，應覓取股實鋪保，出具保單，經局處查明屬實，方得照發。又撤機時如有機件損壞或遺失情事，須照原價賠償。</p>
<p>在上述辦法未經公布前，雖有裝設長途電話專綫者，但均係臨時商訂，辦法紛歧，現旣規定劃一辦法，將來請裝專錢自較便利。此項辦法，可使收發長途電話者足不出戶而與遠地人士晤談一室，且可以節省許多專力費，省事而經濟，二者得兼，希望有此需要者趕速裝用。</p>

<p>電報內用文字繕或之詞句，謂之電語。其種類可分為下列四種：</p>
<p>華文明語　按照國內電報營業通則第五十三條之規定，華文明語係以中國文字繕成，而其意義則明顯貫串，母待索解。此項明語譯成電碼時應照交通部公布之明密電碼新編內所載明碼譯出。華文明語電報之電文，照章應完全以華文明語繕成。但遇有下列各項情形時仍按華文明語價目計費：（甲）用阿拉伯數目字書寫之門牌號數及各項數目，並無秘密意義者；（乙）銀行或錢業電報之電文首端或末尾所加密碼對號字及表示發電日期號數之阿拉伯數目字；（丙）商務標識，例如紅藍車麫粉等；（丁）電報掛號字樣（用於電文內或作為發報人署名，應以上下文義足以證明確為掛號字樣者為限）；（戊電碼新編內所載代日代時電碼，例如99r6　9809，或代日韻目如銑諫等字。又華文明語電報之電文不宜過於簡略，例如「雨壞達桔减穿出」以致意義晦澀，不易索解。至同業中暗號或商行術語，例如「速兌申光仟」「協王拾尖通五」兩例內光字及協王尖通等。亦非一般人所能明瞭或解釋其意義。故電文意義過於簡略晦澀或用暗號術書寫電文者，照章仍應作為華文密語電報計費。但方言俗語並無秘密意義者，例如「咱看俏」，自可認為明語也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 葉林生</p>
<p>常識，當然是很尋常的知識了！使用電話的人們，難道還有不曉得，而必待我來申說的嗎？不過，知識這樣東西，是學來學去，學不盡的，何况一涉尋常，那就更容易使人忽略的了。所以我們特地將「電話用戶應有的常識」具體地列舉起來，報吿用戶們聽聽：</p>
<p>電話機的裝設地點，在原則上，當然由用戶指定。但遇有下面幾種情形的地方。照章是不能裝置電話，或裝置而必須搬移的：</p>
<p>甲，足以受到雨雪的侵入，或潮濕過甚，易損話機，並妨碍聽話的地方。</p>
<p>乙，靠近電燈錢路，或火爐旁邊，容易發生危險的地方。</p>
<p>丙，一宅有住戶數家以上之過廳，走廊，穿堂，容易損壞話機，使用戶感</p>
<p>受損失的地方。</p>
<p>凡是營業性質的用戶——例如商店——或公衆出入繁多的地方——例如旅館——應該在話機外面，加做一木箱——長方形較話機略大旁穿大孔，可以將送話器及受話器掛在外面，必要時，可以下鎖，以免話機或一部份機件的被竊。。住宅電話，不宜裝設在離開臥室過遠的地方。因為這樣，日間旣有不能卽時呌到的麻煩，夜間復有久呌不來，貽誤要事的弊害，（大槪住宅裝戶，夜間如果沒有要事，人家决不給他電話的。）</p>
<p>電話决不可使兒童玩弄，共電式話機，聽話器，（俗名聽筒）自動話機的撥動盤，允不可讓他們取下掛上，（前者）撥來撥去（後者），因為這樣，旣有毀損器物之虞，又足以妨害要號的信用。</p>
<p>電話往來，最好由主人，主婦親自執行（此係專指住宅而言，商店不在此例，）非不得己時，不耍假手僕役，卽請客，應酬等小事，亦宜由本人親自致電，旣可表示恭敬，又不致受人朦蔽。</p>
<p>大雷大雨的時候，最好不要打電話，必不得已而耍通話時，要注意避免觸及金屬部份，以免危險。</p>
<p>火災在遠處的時候，不必多向電局探問，此時電局交換，正在繁忙極點的時期，問亦不能得到滿意的答復，這是公德上，事實上應有的原諒。火災在近處的時候，應該通電向救火機關吿警，但對於親友的電問，非至萬分危險時不必故事誇張，以免懸念。</p>
<p>市內電話，雖無時間的限制，但談話亦宜簡單，不必冗長，以防萬一他人與你有緊急通話的阻碍。</p>
<p>電話機旁，宜備置小冊子一本，附掛鉛筆一枝，如本人不在，他人代接電話時，可將接受的言語，用簡單句子，記錄在上面，以免遺忘。</p>
<p>凡素常往來的用戶號碼，宜塡一表格貼在電話機旁，以便查號。</p>
<p>凡裝戶應該注意的事，當然不止上面所說十項，但是有些似乎瑣碎過甚，有些又嫌手續麻煩，在這裏我們為時間所限，不再一一報吿了。</p>

<p>— 朱光潛</p>
<p>——為「給靑年的十三封信」</p>
<p>光潜先生，</p>
<p>今天接到上海的朋友寄來一部書，打開來一看，使我吃了一驚。封面上題的是「致靑年」，「朱光潜著」，旁邊又附註「給靑年的十三封信」字樣。我第一眼把大名中的「澘」字看成「潛」字。我不知道是因為幻覺還是因為虛榮，不假思索地就把你的大著誤認為我自己的了，這得請你原諒。第一，「朱光澘」和「朱光潛」在字面上實在太相像了。第二，叫做「朱光潛」的我也曾寫過一部小册子叫做「給靑年的十二封信」，而且我的「談美」也被書店在封面上附註過「給靑年的第十三封信」字樣。第三，你的大著和我的拙作的封面圖案也大致相同，也是在一些直線中間嵌了一些星星。你想，這也難怪我錯認，而且錯認的也不祇我一個人。寄大著給我看的那位朋友原先也把你看作我。他在信上說，「在書攤上來回翻道書，越看越不像你寫的，所以買了來給你看看。」下面他還說了一句失敬的話，我不援引罷。你看，他在書攤上「來回」翻這書，「越看」纔發覺「越不像我寫的」。他是知道我的人，不知道我的人們不容易發覺你的大著不是我寫的，恐怕更可原諒吧</p>
<p>光澘先生，我不認識你，但是你的面貌，言動，姿態，性格等等，為了以上所說的一點偶然的因緣，引動了我的狠大的好奇心。我心要現在想像揣摩你像什樣的一個人。許多事都是不戳穿的好，所以我希望你在我心裏永遠保存道一點含有問題的神秘性。但是我也想把心裏想說的話說給你聽。不認識你而寫信給你，似乎有些唐突。請你記得我是你的一個讀者。如果道個資格不够，那祇得怪你姓朱名光澘，而叉寫「給靑年的十三封信了」！</p>
<p>頭一層，我應該向你懺悔。我在寫「給靑年的十二封信」時，自己還是一個靑年。那時候我的朋友夏丐尊先生辦了一個給中學生看的刋物，叫做「一般」，要我寫一點稿子，我就把隨時感觸到的隨時寫成書信寄給他，裏面固然有些是以中學生為對象而寫的，但是大部分是私人切身的感想。我從頭到尾都是看着自己的心去寫，絕對沒有「敎訓」人的念頭，更談不上想到藉這些處女作去出鋒頭或是賺稿費。我根本不相信任何人可以自居「先進者」的地位去「敎導」靑年，而且能够把靑年「敎導」得好。就我自己的經騐說，我在靑年時代最得益的並不是師長的義正辭嚴的敎訓，而是像我一般的年靑的朋友們對於他們自己的內心衝突，掙扎，懷疑，信仰所下的忠實的剖白。這種剖白引起我的同情，印證，感動和回思。我不斷地受這種心靈的激動，也就不斷地獲到心靈的發展。從此我深深地感覺到盧梭在「愛彌兒」裏說的導師和生徒的年齡應相彷彿的話，含有極大的智慧。自己是靑年，纔能够眞正地和靑年做朋友，纔能彼此都覺得是一夥子的人，不論是甜的苦的，大家都可以互相契台，互相同情，這樣纔能彼此互相觀摩激發。我現在看到自己從前寫的「給靑年的十二封信」，心裏實在慚愧。我想每個成年人回想到他在童年時代的稚氣和愚騃，都不免有些慚愧。但是我的那部小册子也正因為那一點坦坦白白地流露出來的稚氣和愚駭，博得一般靑年的愛好。我本來是他們中間的一個人，我的憂愁，我的喜悅也都是他們的憂愁和他們的喜悅，我「吐肚子」向他們談心事，他們覺得和我同情同感。這對於他們有益還是有害，我和他們都不十分較量到。我對於靑年的關係原來不過如此。後來那部小冊子流行狠廣，我便以「給靑年的十二封信」的作者的資格，被好些本不相識的人們認識了。到現在和新朋友們見面，還常被人用這個頭銜來介紹我。他們甚至於用什麼「敎導靑年」的字樣來誇獎我。我有時為這件事不但覺得羞愧，也狠覺得憤慨。我本來厭惡「敎導靑年」的話頭，現在居然被人以「敎導靑年」的字樣安在我的頭上，這就是坦白地流露稚氣和愚騃的報酬或懲罰麼？</p>
<p>光潜先生，你不提防這前車之鑑，別的不說，你就不怕「蹈覆轍」的危險麼？你的大著，我因為時間匆忙，並沒有從頭到尾的細讀，祇的略地這裏翻一點那裏翻一點看了一看。我也稍微有一點感想。第一層，我欽佩你的坦白。你自稱「少年文人」，「先進者」，「對於文學的嗜慾最少已有十年的歷史」，「嘗遍了多少苦痛，碰着了多少釘子」，你援引「政治部，軍隊裏的革命靑年，泰半是愛好文學的」一件事例做斷定一說什麼獻身於文學的人都是柔弱而無可為的人，允其是荒謬極點」的「鐵證」：你承認——這裏我鈔你的一段話，以免斷章取義之嫌：『我觀得現在一般靑年的確有些「發表狂」！……大多的靑年祇怪為什麼登起來的文章總是那幾個名人做的，自己的為什麼不給登載出，他沒有計及人家的作品怎樣的，自己的作又是怎樣，這是現代一般愛好文學的靑年的病態的心理，我深深地感到自己常有這種病態心理。還可武斷地說你也未始沒有這種心理的。這種心理的終點，養成功想「出風頭」，「要稿費」，沒有心想和勇氣去探討文學了，這是何等的危險啊。』</p>
<p>我覺得你這番話都是對的。其次，我欽佩你的自信。你勸人說，「當我們自己的作品還未達十分健全之前，還是以不發表的為妙」。現在你發表的當然是「十分健全」了。你「認為自己祇受了不大高深的敎育，尙能寫一二篇不十分不通的文章，根抵還是基於幾個重要的轉變的讀書過程」。先生，你寫這幾句話的時候，曾經較量一番沒有？你給靑年的敎訓有許多狠有趣味，最難得的是走到靴關，你輕輕地就溜過去了。姑舉三例如下：</p>
<p>「靑年的戀愛是需要的，但倘使是太「迫切」了，太「急」了，便要生出煩悶來，這便是自討苦吃了」。</p>
<p>『讀書要有興趣。證書時以為我是强迫做的工作，那就糟了。興趣是第一要事，如讀最素然無味的數墨哲學等等，亦要當牠是有趣之事』。</p>
<p>『要想作文的人，突然文興勃發，極要寫出一點東西，但一提着筆，却又半個字都寫不出，只得悶悶地坐下。……大胆的說一句，每個靑年作家，當開始要作文的時候，總要嘗到這種苦悶、於是作文的方法，便應了需要而風起雲湧的起來了。」</p>
<p>如此等類的口吻在大著中每篇都可以看見。你在給「芬」的信裏劈頭一句是：</p>
<p>『第一封信剛剛發出，第二信又接踵的來了。因為我知道你接到第一信時，一定會慼覺到我的說話不錯。</p>
<p>收尾一句是：『簾外雨潺潺，春意瓓珊，我狠想念你呢！芬。』</p>
<p>我看到這些地方時，第一個衝動是想說一句「挖苦話」，但是我缺乏「幽默風趣」，這一點衝動立刻就被一陣「世道人心之憂」壓倒了。先生在第一封「致少年文人」的信裏說：『如果欲以「文學」為燦爛的頭銜，或要以「文學」去換飯吃，便成了嚴重的病態』。</p>
<p>這種「嚴重的病態」，先生也許不得不承認，在現在中國文壇似乎已經狠流行了。怎麼辦呢？我本也想對於道種「嚴重的病態」發一點議論，繼而想起這事也非「口舌之爭」所可了事，所以把筆放下，雖然心裏還有些悵惘，不能把這事輕輕地放下。</p>
<p>幾乎和你同姓名的朋友朱光潛。</p>

<h3 id="c214">波格達諾夫逝世八週年 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭叔訥</p>
<p>這是四月，留心社會科學的人會自然的憶起一顆巨大的殞星波格達諾（A.Bogdanoff）。他生於一八七三年，死於一九二八年四月七日，享年五十五歲。雖然他的死給予我們以深沉的惋惜，同時却更顯示了偉大的意義：原來他暮年復歸於往時所曾專修的醫學，在莫斯科做着蘇聯人民保健部所屬血淸醫學研究所所長，他底死就是做了血淸實騐底犧牲。為着謀全民健康福利的增進的實際效用而毫無吝惜地捨去了軀體，這精神特別是對於我們中國的資本主義化了的醫學界，顯現出無上的崇高！我們正可從道中間意味到一番嚴重的敎訓！歲月如流，而今又已是他逝世後的第八週年了。</p>
<p>如大家所知道的一般，波格達諾夫是一位眞摯的革命家，且是一位淵博的學者。著作甚豐，並很富獨創的意見。他對於文學也造詣甚深，在知名的作品中有他底創作「紅星」，各國多有譯本。他底文藝批評集「藝術與勞動者」關於無產的藝術底論究，乃是藝術理論建設上有價値的文獻。實際又就是由於他的實生活與社會科學的豐富經驗的產品。他會做過全俄最高經濟會議議長，關於社會經濟的學說他早有壓倒的威名！我們曉得研究人與人間的社會的勞動關係，固屬於經濟學的根本任務，但不能不涉及生產過程底其它方面，只要那「技術的」及「意識的」方面有影響於社會勞動關係底發達的，便得立即考慮到這上面去，這由於决定一般經濟關係的是生產手段技術的發展；因而技術生活的事實對於我們的硏究允為重要，這里，波格達諾夫在他所著「經濟科學」一書中已給我們明白的指出了。</p>
<p>這是一部世界名著。在許多的經濟學著述中，當得起被推為最具有體系的一部傑搆。我們可以從這書裏得悉社會底經濟現象，和社會底演進過程。故我們母寗把它看作「經濟學原論」，且更可以當它「社會進化史」來讀。木書首從自然自足的社會，論究到商業社會，系統而詳明地一一演述經濟的過程的劇目。在那裏面掘毀了各種關係的不安定性底根本矛盾，給抽出一些結論，那便是集團主義的確立——一種新文化主義；它是代替權力及個人主義的。雖則它們在努力團結组織的一點，有着共同的所在，但資產階級對於自由的理想，就亳不關心。其所維護的只是以一己為界限的個人權利，並不立足於人與人的關係上，乃立足於人與人的分離上。在集團主義中的個人是集合的，只被認為不可破壞的連鎖中之一僩有生命的環節底論點，就截然不同。所以集團主義從主義上否定權力主義，而排除宗敎的感情及思想底一切基礎。將社會的勞動共同體底經騐放在第一位，並用它作一切眞理及價値的試金石，特別適用於經濟學及社會科學的範疇；因之給暴露商品靈物崇拜的醜惡。在價値的外殼之下發現結晶的集團勞動，由此組織成人類共同的意識形態，協作底勢力。它創造唯物史觀的學說，即以社會的生產過程為社會發展底基礎的學說。於此，我得特別指明，就是唯物史觀和經濟史觀有別，反之，作那種混同解釋時例如塞里格曼，則犯下重大的錯誤。</p>
<p>集團主義旣認人類為生產關係所决定而組織團體，那就是勞動共同體的社會意識，科學的社會主義。當二十世紀資本主義進到最後的階段的今天，社會主義的起來已經打倒了佔全球地面六分之一的資本主義，社會勢力移動的方向底主要特徵，蓋已明白表現；，然而目前要完全觀察未來社會的微細之點却有不可能，因為社會現象非常複雜。這本書末篇「社會化的有組織的社會」著者竟昭示了它的理論與實際底大體的輪廓。有些人却疑心科學沒有權能討論還沒有到來的事情，而著者則吿訴我們科學正為豫言事物而存在。要照我個人的意思，科學原依附哲學並行不悖。哲學的性質雖是以內相為根本問題，但其心理的內相是由科學於外相事物所探尋的結果而來，像著者寫的另一本與此書體裁相同的「社會意識學」，便是以思維方法奠定科學研究底基石。故爾雖係哲學的論著，同時也即是討論文化全體而有科學風貌的書籍，例如他提示給我們的是這樣：一種社會意識現象的原因，是也有存在別種社會意識現象之中的，其通過的途徑如下：一切社會形態底一切發展原因都存在生產底領城內，就是社會和自然底勞動鬬爭中。這便是社會的因果性，亦即科學所以能抽出關於未曾經騐的未來社會的結論底理由。</p>
<p>誠然，意識形態是携成經濟生活的一種手段，因之成為經濟進化底重要條件，故我們除非不探討經濟科學則巳，不然意特沃羅幾底硏究就成為必要。這所謂社會意識，即包括語言，文字，藝術，哲學，宗敎，道德，習慣，法律，思想，科學等「文化」或「精神文化」；波格達諾夫的「社會意識學」底全貌，却更能循着歷史的順序為之加以解說，將社會意識的本際與演變及其將向着何方進發等闡發無遺，實際這書正可說是一部文化發達史。我着實不曾見有像這樣完全的關於思維方法底科學硏究的全系列的專書，尤其在這當中很幸運的給尋獲更多的重要底啟示。在這金融資本已經完成的時代，資本主義日趨於由朋壞之途，而惹起非常的危機，世界大戰即將暴發了，不幸這對於集團主義一般都以為必引動意特沃羅幾的突然動搖以至崩壞，相反的，本書提示我們世界戰爭顯然比平時的軍國主義更提供了許多的材料，表明資本主義制度底性質。迅速引起人類底統一及集團底組織能力無比的緊張。以和自然鬥爭，去制服自然，把勞動力發展到無窮無盡。</p>
<p>末了，我要拈出本書提到的一個特別値得討論的問題；——一切勞動的過程，其本原的形態便是語言底發生，依據近年來語言學界新的學派馬爾（他是蘇聯的學士院會員）的學說，人類勞動行為的特性，即意識是和語言有密切的連繫。創造語言的人類社會不息地變動，因此語言的結構也在不息底變動中，我們須得統一人類底語言以為全世界共同底一般組織形態，故爾世界語運動是必要的，然而本書著者則說這種運動全然由於智識階級底空想。其實設依據人類生活實際的統一而考定全行為底組織形態，那語言統一的形成自無可疑。雖然本書被發現有這樣足資討究的一點，但確無損於全書一系列的理論，我們正該仔細地來誦閱。</p>
<p>在世界大戰爆發的前夜，我們格外需要堅實的社會經濟底習識，沒有這種知識則在這非常時期便不能不彷徨，四處摸不出頭路。我們何不記起波格達諾夫的啟示呢？在他的「經濟科學」和「社會意識學」的裏邊。後者巳由陳望道施存統兩先生譯出，前者則由施先生譯出更名「經濟科學大綱」。在開明書店出版。</p>
<p>這是四月，一個眞摯的革命家死去已八年了。無窮的仰慕，無窮的追念，兜上了脆弱的心靈，允其是當我讀了他這兩大巨著之後。</p>
<h3 id="c215">巴金的「海底夢」 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 淸水</p>
<p>是客歲的初夏吧？我問景深兄的私生活是什麼，他回復我說『近來大讀巴余的小說，…………』這一來使本已讀過一些巴金的小說的我，益發因景深兄的「大讀」的提引而更感着興趣去閱讀了。這橡的，他在開明書店印行的「海行雜記」，「海底夢」，我是一手把它抓着，跑到離寓所很遠的圖書館去，坐在裝有暖氣管的圓園椅上，在兩個不同的日期內，一口氣把它讀下去了。兩書我都很愛讀，但是二者之中，我却特別的愛上了這一本「海底夢」。</p>
<p>因為，道短短的記載，可以看出一些我們想看應看的『沒有悲哀，沒有回憶。我只有快樂，只有希望。』的『我等待着，我預備着，我充滿了希望，充滿了信仰。』的「我不需要愛，愛只有使人痛苦』的『寗願被那愛慕你的思念折磨到死，……不願違背了信仰寫那悔過書來換得自由，換得自由來過以前的那種貴婦的生活』。喊着『我也許還缺乏勇氣，但我有肉，有血，有感情。我不能够在萬物開始繁榮的季節中讓自己腐朽在這裏，不做一點事。』的為着爭自由與解放民族而奮鬥的男女英雄們的戰績與靈魂。我們一頁頁地讀下去起了同感的作用，彷彿看一塲人吃人的生之搏戰的苦鬥故事，展現在目前。我流淚，我同情，我歡樂，我高呼的感着作者所說的『這裏面有哀訴，有絕望，有眼淚，有矛盾，有掙扎，但結果却給了我一個希望。』的話最有道理。把書本看完，瞑目一想，覺着這麼滿是火藥味與血腥瀰蓋了的天地，假如有那麼誠實的强壯的戰士肯為「自由」「正義」而不斷地苦戰，犧牲的話，這充滿着希望的値得留戀的新世界，是會展現在我們的眼前；不能當它是渺茫的夢景，一定不能够找尋得到的。</p>
<p>我們十分明白，這不尋常的別開生面的抓着了這個不尋常的時代的核心來寫成的這一本簇新的有力量有意識的童話，幷不是作者憑恃其天才的想像力所虛搆而成的。我們知道太平洋上的「利伯洛島」國是誰，我們也一樣的曉得那被稱為「高國」的侵略者又是誰。書中寫得驚心動魄的大焚殺的備極凄慘的故事（下半部）幷不是完全靠着卓越的想像織搆出來。作者在結末上（頁一三〇）若隱若現的紀述，是値得我們之絕大注意。明白的說罷，這簡直可以說是以我們這國難日以壘積的動盪危亡的「老大帝國」做背景而寫成的一部新鮮的有內容有力量的童話。這紆曲的，壯烈的，故事，把「九一八」以至「一二八」的往事都裝了進去。這是熱情的產物，道是時代的寵兒，沒有那不絕地發生的現實的屠殺，大規模的屠殺來作背景來激起作者沸騰了心，沸騰了血，未必能够寫得這麼的淋漓盡致，血淚交流。未必能够這麼容易的『滲進了不少陸地上的血或淚」。未必能够使這薄薄的小書，不尋常的，有「這是血的海，淚的海。血是中國平民底血。淚是中國平民底淚。」的孕育。在另一方面說，要是沒有那空前的不人道的資本帝國主義者的「一二八」的上海大屠殺，作者是不容易把他自己的血淚也壓榨出來滴在裏面。『這是熱誠的產物，我寫牠連思索的時間也沒有。是熱誠不許我思索，因為牠自己要奔放出來。我每晚拿起筆就寫，寫到覺得可以暫時打住時就放下筆，我寫得很快，而且自已也覺得寫得痛快。』的情景，也就蕊難竄了上來，在作者的筆尖上，這麼的奔騰，飛躍。</p>
<p>這麼薄薄的一本書，一點不含糊的就在這麼薄薄的一本書裏面的描繪舉　刻，雖沒有像魯迅筆尖上那樣的辛辣，知堂筆鋒下那樣的悠閒，資平小說上那樣的細膩，可是，却像沫若初期作品的奔放，儼如達夫的小說般的一氣呵成，朗朗可口。其實，這麼啃住了時代的核心的孕育着血與淚的交流的童話的寫作，不比普通的小品與雜文，事實上也無須於過分辛辣的筆鋒跟無限度的悠閒與細膩的摹寫。這是翻讀此書時，不可不知的。至若慷慨悲壯的故事的敷陳，繪述，前篇是寫得多麼的有聲有色，栩栩欲活。後篇，則有悽慘的畫圖的展佈，有奮鬥的戰績的表揚，有愛與自由的心之訟戰的刻述，這紆廻曲折的描寫，這旁敲側擊的櫬托，這心理變化的細述，更烘托出這個為自由而犧牲一切的女傑——利娜的靈魂，可歌可頌的</p>
<p>今年聽說是極端可怕的年頭，高人國的情形更是顯著的變得兒有些異樣。作者幾年前，寫稿時，便精知灼見的駡道我們男子都是屈服的奴隷，雖然有時候不是，但是，等到別人拿着機關槍，大炮來對付，就卑鄙的統統跪下去了。「只知道謀自己底利益。為了這個利益，他們甚至可以賣掉自己底信抑和自己底父母。」現在看起來，我們除掉自訟自資而外，對於這本作者以他的血和淚而寫成的「海底夢」，也就益發覺着他的可貴了。「國難文學」，「國防文學」，「民族文藝」，的呼聲高澈了雲霄。看倌們！道不是一本以我們中國的「血的海」「淚的海」來寫成的，現成的眞情的流露的熱與力的混成的有思想有內容的十足貨色麼？我們如是不甘於「平凡」與「屈服」，知道『奴隸們底命運只有靠奴隸自己來决定』，那嗎，請大家念着『自由，難道還有比你更美麗的東西嗎？…………』的話，把自己獻給事，犧牲了個人底一切幸福，去追求衆人的幸福。』在這麼『一本充滿着哀訴，絕望，眼淚，矛盾，掙扎而最後竟被一個希望全掩蓋了」的書本裏尋求着了自由與生存的眞諦，努力奮鬥的翻開生活的新樣，反抗侵略者得佔據者，以達到總結算的時期到來的最後勝利！</p>
<p>這麼的年頭需要這麼熱烈而且有力的一本書。這不獨是服興奮劑，也有不少的維他命在裏頭。我如有資格推薦適合於這動盪中的大戰前夕的文學書本的話，我將亳不遲疑的先舉出這一本「海底夢」來。</p>

<p>「十萬個爲什麽」　　伊林著·董純才譯</p>
<p>定價三角五分　開明書店出版</p>
<p>科學在今日的中國是怎樣的重要，巳經有許多專文在各種書報上議論過，我不願多說。但要研究科學，必先有硏究的興趣，然後纔能「埋頭苦幹」。現在有些出版家似乎已經注意到這一層。但像這本「十萬個為什麼」這樣趣味豐富的書，似乎還很少見。前幾天我無意中在開明書店買到這本書，一連讀了好幾遍，愈讀愈愛。關於書的名字，我從前也曾見過好幾决，總把牠看做「十萬個」為什麼，以為是一本深奧的數學　；因為趣味不大相投，所以沒有去買。現在纔知道牠是十萬個「為什麼」；意思就是說許許多多的「為什麼」。裏面的文字也都很淺顯，就是高小的學生也很能理解。牠能够把一個視科學如仇敵的人的心引誘回來。現在把牠的優點，約略舉出幾個，介紹給素來厭惡科學的人，自然，愛好科學的人更可一讀：</p>
<p>一，用童話來引出科學。自來的科學文字大都喜歡用嚴肅的口吻，列出許多公式，扳着面孔，逼着你記憶許多原理，做許多習題；使你一看見牠，就會覺得疑懼厭惡，永遠不想和牠親近。這結果，不但對你沒有一些好處，而且無形中使你不會再想去了解牠。</p>
<p>本書的作者似乎深知這種弊病。他不但沒有扳着面孔，而且生怕你丟開似的，故意用一些有趣的談話，或童話的文字，懇切地引誘你向他發問，再一一地給你簡明的答覆。使你好像同一位密友「促膝談心」，而在無意中得到許多日常的智識。我們隨便翻開一頁來看吧：</p>
<p>「焚燒乾燥的松枝，炸得辟拍的響。愉快的火熖，像鄕下彈提琴似的，使得廚房裏的一切東西都舞躍着：藍色瓷粙的茶壺，將蓋子拋在空中，像頂帽子，回頭又立刻接住。煎東西的鐵鍋，噴濺着水氣，歡樂的震動。那大銅鍋，也忘了牠的尊嚴，吃吃的笑得像個痴子，溢流出了沸騰的水，直淌到鄰近的鐵鉢。你們都稱呼這兒是個廚房——但是我稱呼牠為化學實騐室。」</p>
<p>讀了這段文字，立刻可以想像到一間熱鬧的廚房的情形。以後他便要站在這實騐室中吿訴你「一個小麵團子在那調和碗裏，會突然活起來」。「一塊肉放在湯鍋裏，一點鐘後，就變了樣子，變得認不出來了。」……再下去，他便把這些問題細細的吿訴你，使你出神。</p>
<p>二，從科學中講述故事　這本書我們也可以稱牠為「科學故事」。因為這裏面有很多的科學故事。大概可分為兩種：一種是，把一切科學變化寫成了故事。種是關於各種東西的發明及發展的故事。例如他在「病紐扣」中說到錫器也會生瘟病，便講了一則故事：</p>
<p>「七十年前，在列寗格勒的某一軍隊中，錫器會有過這樣的流行病。兵士的軍裝上用的武裝紐扣，都藏在一個食橱裹。忽然，在紐扣上發現一種形跡可疑的疹，即刻全體紐扣，都佈滿了黑斑。大家都驚異極了。……那些紐扣就在他們眼前碎成粉末，……</p>
<p>「科學家們費了很久的時間，絞着他們的腦汁，想說明這怪病的原因。後來終於找出了，你想是什麼呢？……」</p>
<p>這種有趣的故事，穿插在書中，幾乎到處都可看到。如歐洲的波伊地革發明瓷器，威尼斯人的秘密製造鏡子，最初到英國的叉子，古代人飲食的情形等，都很有趣，就是把牠們當做純粹的故事來讀，也無不可。</p>
<p>三，新鮮的問題，簡明的解答許多科學寫作家，往往把很平常的問題寫得非常玄妙。所以本來很易明瞭的東西，一看了他的書，反弄得糊塗了。本書中所有的問題，本來都很平常，却為許多人所忽略了的，所以一經提出，似乎很新鮮了。例如，他問：「有不透明的水，有透明的鐵嗎」？這種問題就是一般人再也不會想到的，但是作者却吿訴你；「其　水也只有上層是透明的。海洋的底層，不是漆黑的嗎」？「不久以前，有一位科學家，造了一片鐵片，只有一耗的十萬分之一的厚。這鐵片透明如玻璃。」這樣新鮮的問題，簡明的解答，很多很多，成為這木書的骨幹。</p>
<p>書中把一個房間分成七個碼頭，從這七個碼頭講了六十餘個「為什麼」，再從這些大的「為什麼」分派出更多的小問題。如果畫成表格，恰似一棵茂樹。但是雖然有這麼多問題和解答，全書却只有一百十七頁。只耍費兩三小時即可讀完；換句話說，你只要費兩三小時，就能從這本書中得到無數的科學常識。而且這些常識，多半是別的科學書上不大見得到的。</p>

<p>— 胡適</p>
<p>我很高興的參加母校三十五周的紀念刋，因為我是受過澄衷學堂很大的恩惠的。我在「四十自述」裏曾記載我在澄衷受的益處（頁九五——一一〇）。我進澄衷是在一九〇五年春天，决年的暑假我就離開澄衷了。我離開澄衷整整三十年了。但我現在回憶那一年半的光陰，我還覺得那是我幼年最得益的時期。</p>
<p>我回想在澄衷最得益的是英文算學兩項的嚴格訓練。兩項之中，最得力的是英文。當時大學極少，故中學的地位較高，能够請到很好的敎員。澄衷的英文敎員，如張鏡人先生，陳詩豪先生，都是能說，能寫，能細細講解的。他們都是聖的翰大學出來的，思想見解也許不算很高明。例如他們用“Peter　Parley”的世界史來敎我們，開卷第一章就是上帝創造世界，第二章是洪水，……最後一章是孔夫子，揷圖上畫的孔夫子帶着淸朝的大帽朝珠！他們的見解雖然有時帶點敎會學堂的陋氣，然而他們同時從敎會學堂帶來了嚴格的語言訓練，使他們成為最好的中學英文敎員。每天有一張習字，每天有默書，每天有造句作文的練習，都是每天批改的，都是每月有積分的。一年半的嚴格訓練，使我得着一點讀書作文的基本技能，我不能不感謝這幾位先生。</p>
<p>我因此推想，中學是人生最重耍的時期，其重要性在於做學問的技能和習慣的養成。技能與習慣都不是僅僅灌輸的方法所能養成的，都必須倚靠日常的練習。所以中學敎員的選擇必須注重在技能的精熟，與訓練的認眞。敎員自己的技能若不精熟，例如英文敎員不能寫，讀，說話，他如何能養成別人的技能呢？敎員若不肯認眞訓練學生，例如英文敎員怕改卷子，他如何能養成學生工作的習慣呢？</p>
<p>澄衷學堂是有基金的，在國內私立中學之中要算經濟力最厚的了。然而辦澄衷的人，始終不敢慕「升格」的虛榮，不敢辦高級中學，始終用全力去辦初中和小學。這是澄衷的最大的光榮，是澄衷量可以為全國模範之處。我希望澄衷的董事和校長始終保持這個不升格的高風，始終用全副精神去辦一個最認眞的初級中學和小學。基金儘可以增加，——我盼望創辦人家屬和校董和畢業生能帮助本校基金的增加，——但基金豐富之後，我仍舊希望澄衷不辦高中，只抬高敎員的待遇，提高敎員的人選，使澄衷成為全國最有成績的初中。這個小小的意見，就算我的賀禮吧。</p>

<p>— 王顯廷</p>
<p>澄衷母校成立三十五週年，吳校長粹倫馳書微文，情詞懇摯，義不容辭；且自惟　齡入學，迄今凡二十餘寒暑，受澄衷敎育之薰陶者適得其半，一年前祺承校董會寵命，襄助校務，雖為時甚暫，而情感益深：逢此盛典，更不能不以片言為頌。</p>
<p>校主葉公幼年失學，旣達，乃慨然以普及敎育為己任，建巨厦，延良師，招徠學子，同沐敎化。今日談海上中等敎育者，多以澄衷為模範：追本溯源，微葉公創業之功其易克臻此？雖然，澄衷固肇基於葉公，而葉公令名亦以澄衷而永垂不朽，善人食報，宜也！</p>
<p>澄衷立校於虹口，虹口故多中產以下之家，天才子弟往往受厄於境遇，中涂輟學，不克展其所長，及澄衷成立，以課程完備，取費特廉，始相率來學，縱以額滿見遺，亦寗稍待而不願之他。三十五年來造就人才，殆以數千計！顧澄衷脩金之收入雖微，而對敎職員之待遇則不溥。海上人文薈萃，學府林立，三四十年來能使敎員安心供職，不外騖於薪給之厚薄或有無者，除澄衷外，殊不多覯：此則歷屆校車會諸先生辛苦維護之功，凡我全體師生，身受其賜，皆當感念不置者也！</p>
<p>去今十五年前，母校舉行二十週年紀念曁校主銅像揭幕禮，故校長曹師微吾慷慨陳詞，以奮勉求學無負校主創學苦心為諸生勗。今日校主銅像巍然屹立，曹師遺訓亦彷彿在耳，而欲與其握手言歡，重親醫咳，已不可得。曹師盡力校務，獎借後進，二十年來未嘗稍懈，「旦蛻化，感愴無旣！差幸我澄衷前途，日益光大，曹師遺志，賡續有人，如其地下有知，亦必引以為慰也。</p>
<p>余生也晚，敎育行政更非所長，年前襄助校務，蒙吳校長粹倫之指導，獲益良多。吳先生為敎育界名宿，精勤自勵，備著賢勞，今有陳先生虞孫為臂助，相得益彰：得人之慶，尤堪燕賀！當此母校三十五週年紀念良辰，敢貢蕪詞，為校董會曁吳陳二先生壽，詞曰：漪歟歇浦，　舍相望。唯我澄衷，多士蹌蹌。卅五景運，弦誦鏗鏘。敎澤長垂，蔚為國光！</p>

<p>— 吳友孝</p>
<p>一，沿革</p>
<p>校主鎭海葉公澄衷，於前淸光緒二十五年九月，捐欵興學，二十七年二月，本校成立，名澄衷蒙學堂，設尋常小學與高等小學，由校董會聘劉樹屏為總理，主持校務。二十九年添辦中學，校名去蒙字，並增商科及師範科，後二者旋廢。三十一年二月，江蘇巡撫陸元鼎為本校奏請立案。三十三年冬，停辦中學。民國元年，改稱私立澄衷初高等小學校。二年二月，重設中學。三年七月，改行秋季始萊。四年一月，敎育部准予立案。九年秋，添設甲種商科。十年叫月，校主銅像開幕。十二年秋，小學中學商科均改四二制。十五年夏，舊中甲商畢業完了。秋，添辦高中及專修科。十六年夏，廢止專修科，並停辦高中。十七年二月，呈奉上海市敎育局核准立案，分稱中學為私立澄衷中學校，小學為私立澄衷中學附屬小學校，中小學均添春季始業班，改中學為三三制。十九年夏，商科畢業完了，亦遂廢止。秋，重設高中。二十年三月，敎育部准予備案，二十一年春，停辦高中。二十三年二月，運照敎育部令，小學用專有名稱，去附屬名義，稱為私立澄衷小學校，校長由中學校長兼任。此本校三十五年中校名及設科變遷之大略也。</p>
<p>總理劉樹屛請假時，代理者為蔡元培。繼劉之後者為章祲白作霖，均稱掌敎，至蔣元慶則稱監督。以上數人，均有總敎輔之，總敎主察課事，今之敎務長也。蔣之後仟謝觀，始稱校畏，不設總敎。民國元年，曹慕管繼任校長，復設敎務長，亦由校董會聘任，此制遂迄於今。曹校長仟職最久（十六年），曹去而敎務長葛祖蘭繼之，葛之後又有勵乃驥陳彬龢二人。陳校長於二十三年七月辭職，校董會乃委友孝承乏焉。</p>
<p>初立校時，學生祇一百二十五人，其後學額漸增，至二十年秋，為一千三百四十五人。一二八滬戰發生，學生驟减十分之四，後又漸漸恢復，至本年達一千叫百五十六人，蓋已為新紀錄矣。</p>
<p>最初校基，祇二十四畝八分五釐四毫，後經陸續購入，現有三十四畝六分八釐，除懷德堂（故校主校董奉祀所）占地三畝四分四釐七亳外，實共三十一畝二分三釐三毫，惟十之三四為出租之屋，自用者僅十之六七而巳。</p>
<p>校舍方面，初建正舍三十幢，旁舍十五幢，雨中操塲一所，其後添建及改建五决：　大自嗚鐘一座及鐘樓五幢；　西首樓房十餘幢及廚房膳廳；　廚房及校役宿舍擴大建築；　改建雨中操場為澄廳，（健身房兼大會堂）並添建浴室；　紀念三十週年之世美堂。合計所占面秋，殆與最初之屋相等。此又三十五年來校長史替學生數及校塊校舍逐漸擴充之大槪也。</p>
<p>二，現况</p>
<p>本校自二十三年春小學與中學分立後，對外雖為兩校，而事實上除組織及敎訓兩部中小學以性質不同而各異外，餘如校舍校具之使用，經費之支配，及辦事之聯絡，則仍如一校也。下文所述槪况，因中小學多相同者，故以中學為主，小學有特異處則附記之。</p>
<p>行政組織　校長統轄全校行政事宜，敎務長　助之，行政系統分敎務訓育體育（小學體育不獨立）事務（小學稱總務，範圍稍異）經濟五部，部各設主任一人，部員若干人。又另設校翳一人，掌理全校衛生事宜；圖書館主任一人，掌理全校圖書事宜；（小學設圖書館指導員）各級設級任一人，寒助訓育主任處理各學級訓育事宜。此外又有各種會議及委員會等。本校內部組織之旨趣，注重事務分掌及會議公　兩點，故各部之責仟，務期分担，而全校之精神，力求統一，蓋欲以分工之方法，達共治之目的也。</p>
<p>校地校會及設備　校地已如上述。校舍共一百六十餘間，差可敷用。又學校園及運動埸各二，均賺太小。校具七千九百餘件。自然科儀器藥品標本模型及掛圖二千餘件，約當部頒標準四分之三；體育用具一千餘仆；勞作用具三百餘件；中西書籍五萬八千餘册，目前尙　應用。</p>
<p>經費　每學期學膳宿費等收入，約二萬五千元，支出的四萬儿，（敎薪七五％設備費一一％行政費一四％）不敷約一萬五千元，山校董會津貼。經濟部職員，由校董會聘任，會　帳目，平時由校長稽核，學期終了時之决算，由校董會聘請會計師審查後公布之。</p>
<p>敎職員　中小學共六十七人：其中任職最久滿三十年者一人；其决滿二十年者一人，滿十五年者三人；滿十年者七人；滿五年者十五人；未滿五年者三十五人；未滿一年者四人。多數人之資格，中學為國內大學畢業，小學為師範學校畢業。平均月薪，中學為七十五元，小學為四十四元。</p>
<p>學級編制及學生　中小學均有春秋季始業各學級，升降以學期為單位，可不受年之限制。現有初中八級，補習班一級，學生三百六十三人；小學二十二級，學生一千零九十三人，共計一千四百五十六人。學生年齡，中學最高十七歲九月，最低十二歲一月，平均為十五歲二月；小學最高十六歲，最低五歲二月，平均十一歲六月。籍貫百分之七十五為浙江，家長職業百分之八十一為商業。</p>
<p>課程及敎學方法　中小學課程，均照部頒標凖，惟中學三年級增職業科，（簿記，打字等）小學五六年級增英語，以適應需要。敎學方法，中學兼採自學輔導與問題討論制！小學高中級主用自學輔導法，低級力求興趣化。每學期舉行學科競賽及各項測騐，此外父有規定之假期作業等。</p>

<h3 id="c225">救救中學生的問題在那裏 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 李先荷</p>
<p>—出版界應該努力的一點—</p>
<p>自從陳衡哲女士在獨立評論上提出了救救中學生的問題以後，非英先生又在新人周刋上提出了「中學生的問題在那裏」一文，作者拜讀了他們兩位的大文以後，發生了許多感想，現在試述管見如次：</p>
<p>陳女士和非英先生以為中學生之問題在於康健受摧殘，而所以受到摧殘的原因，一為課渠太繁重，二為會考制度之八股化，三為高中數理太艱深。據筆者觀察，這三點都沒有觸及中學生健康問題的核。</p>
<p>目前中學校之科目，常常受到一般學生以及學生家長的責難，認為科目太繁多。共實學校中課目之繁簡，是社會生活和文化程度的反映，我們試把敎育部頒佈的中學課程標準加以查閱，究竟有什麼學科，可以刪削的呢？至於鐘點的多寡，那麼照敎育部規定的也沒有多大可增减，所以課業的繁重問題，似乎並不成為問題。會考制度之八股化，而有改良會考的必要，這筆者完全同意，因為以目前各中學敎材之不相同，敎學進程之不相同，而希望以統一的試題測騐各中學生的程度，似乎反成為故意和中學生為難了。所以筆者認為會考的辦法須加改善，即各校之敎材必須一致，敎學的進度必須一致，會考的試題更必須針對各中學生課業而不涉於苛細。不過這會考問題，筆者認為並不是摧殘一般中學生健康的主要因素。高中數理之太艱深而對於沒有數理天才的靑年是一種傷害，關於這點，筆者認為的確是今日敎育制度上的大問題，因為硏究高深的學問，决不是可以强求的；而日勉强求之，非但不會有尺寸之進步，並且可使沒有數理天才的中學生腦筋反變成麻木而愚蠢。不過假定以這一點為中學生健康受摧殘的主要因素，似乎也沒有觸及問題的中心。</p>
<p>筆者認為今日中學生健康受摧殘的主要原因，决不是課業之繁重，會考制度之八股化，及高中數理之太艱深，而是中學生的性敎育問題。目前戕靑年最深刻而嚴重者，莫過於性的摧殘問題。</p>
<p>有多多少少的男女靑年，他們在自己的靑春發育期中，已很早的隨得性的關係了。在中國的家庭裏，學校裏，社會上，向來把性的問題視為神秘而不應公開討論的，於是這一般男女靑年不幸地陷入了歧途，偷偷摸摸地看各種淫書淫畫，偷偷摸摸地幹各種不道德的行為，整日整夜地戕賊自己的身心。假定我們秘密加以察查，不論男子中學或女子中學，這種可怕的現象是怎樣深刻而普遍呵！家長們是沒有注意到，師長們是沒有注意到　社會上是沒有注意到，於是靑年們深入岐途而不自知。戕賊了自己的身心，妨礙了自己的健康造成了這一代靑年兒女健康衰弱的普遍情形，形成了一個民族絕大的危機！</p>
<p>假定我們不觸及這影響靑年康健的核心原因，而以為課業繁重·數理艱深·會考八股化等為摧殘靑年康健的因子，那麼救救中學生的問題，還是得不到解决，而且白白地忙亂了一陣。</p>
<p>講到這裏，筆者認為出版界是應該盡一部份責任的，因為性敎育的問題在事實上最難山學校中的師長們口講指劃的，最好山出版界方面專以大中學生之靑年為對象，出版幾種性敎育的專籍，除將男女的生理詳加解剖外，並且將各種不道德行為之弊害，詳為解釋，予以科學的說明，靑年們閱讀之餘，自必驚惕而不敢胡為，再加以家長們和師長的嚴加訓導，也許摧殘中學生的康健的主要因素，可得而解决吧！則夫</p>
<h3 id="c226">「世界文化史」的介紹 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 則夫</p>
<p>桑戴克原著　倪受民譯　世界出版</p>
<p>世界文化之發掘，搜集，和整理的工作，的確是一件非常重要而又非常艱難的工作，往往一個學者竭盡了畢生的精力去硏究某一個時代某一個地方的古代文化，心力交瘁，鞠躬盡瘁，然而所得的結果還需要後繼者繼起奮鬥，吾則還是得不到定論的。在歐美，致力於這種工作的學者較多，在中國可謂絕無而僅有。因歐美學者之孜孜兀兀於此，所以目前一部世界文化史上，關於歐美的部份，尙見充實，關於遠東方面，允其是中國，却成了一個世界的謎。譬如卡爾馬克思對於歐美的社會制度，從原始時期——直到近代，都有了相當精審的理解，關於東方却模糊了，在他亳無辦法之中，把東方的生產方式名之曰亞珊亞的生產方式，在他原是因為缺少考據的材料，然而中國一般以馬克思為偶像的人們却奉為圭臬，不知不覺地走入了牛角尖。所以在世界文化史上，關於中國原始時代的部份還是一張白紙，這工作是需要我們衣於斯食於的中國人民自已去完成牠的。</p>
<p>桑戴克Lynn　Thorndika的世界文化史，不僅對於歐洲的部份有許多廣博的解釋，而目關於遠柬文化之重要性，也認識得異常堅强，他說：「在我們看來，近代文化固然主要是屬於歐洲和美洲，但是要整個地來觀察文化，則遠東方面種種偉大的文化，是萬不可忽略的，因此在這本書中，關於它們的本身，以及它們與西方的關係，我們都論到了。』</p>
<p>不過，桑戴克先生對於遠東文化之重要性固然發了一個宏願，然而他的努力顯然是披荊忻棘的初期的戮力，關於中國上古的文化還是不能深入地去理解它，但這也是不能責備他的，因為種種的條件限制了他不能有偉大的發見，這種責任還是應該我們來担負的。</p>
<p>可是從這部書的全體而言，不能不說是一部相當完善，簡要的世界文化史，現在把它的內容，扼要錄之如次：第一篇是史前文化與原始文化；第二篇是近東古代文化之發展；第三篇是古典文化及其裝微；第四篇是遠東文化；第五篇是中古之近東文化：第六篇是西方文化之復興；第七篇是近代初期；第八篇是現代文化之起原。各篇之中，都分章分節，倪受民先生的譯筆也淸順流利，很便於閱讀，最後有文化大事表，從舊石器時代起，一直到一九二五年近，將各年間重要的大事一一列入，頗便於查閱，全書六三四頁，多叫十萬言，世界書局出版，定價三元，謹將此書介紹於讀者之前。</p>

<h3 id="c227">「中國婦女甚自由」 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 史</p>
<p>馬丁夫人繼「節育」演講之後，於七日晚間又在銀行公會俱樂部舉行演講：「婦女參政問題」。</p>
<p>據華東社的說，「其演辭以英國維多利亞女皇時代起，迄歐戰終了時止之婦女在英國地位情形」，而末後說到中國女性，則說，「中國婦女甚自由，未經過多大奮鬥，卽有參政權。但據余觀察，因過份自由，致缺少聯絡，若欲真正平等，就須經過量有效力之奮鬥與團結也」。</p>
<p>在「夫以妻貴」，「妻以夫榮」的現狀下，「中國婦女」似乎是確然是「甚自由」的，但是這種「甚自由」的「中國婦女」，却祇於「名流」們的太太或是他們的女公子們，她們不僅有所謂「參政權」，她們的物質上的享用，也別說中國的勞動婦女是連夢想都不能及，就以名為「政治經濟工作享受諸方，已完全平等」的英國的勞働婦女來說罷，也是享用不到的。她們在「中國婦女」中形成為特權階級，正和她們「名流」的丈夫在中國男子中成為特權階級是同樣的。</p>
<p>倍倍爾在他的偉大的著作「婦人與社會」序言中說：「在現在社會內部，參加改良婦人地位的運動的婦女，和援助這種運動的男子，多將婦人獲得完全平等的市民權，當作最後的目的。但是，卽使這種資產階級的參政論者，達到了他們的目的，男女同權，能够實現，婦人的性的奴隷制度，和妻子的經濟依賴主義，還是不能打破。婦人的大多數，對於在社會上比較的幸福的數千的同性，受高等敎育，就高級職業，都是和她們自身沒有關係的問題。數千幸福的婦女的地位改善，是决不能改善婦人全體的一般狀態的」。</p>
<p>「所以我們的目的，不是資產階級婦人運動所當為唯一目的的在現在社會制度之下的男女平等，而是人類和人類間，——就是女性和男性間從屬關係的解放、婦女問題的這種解决，是和社會問題的解决相一致的」。</p>
<p>「中國婦女」已獲得了完全平等的市民權了沒有？祇要看一看事實，就不難解答：而就在這樣可憐的狀態下，不是還有人在喊着「婦女回家庭去」！「婦女回廚房去」嗎？不是還有領導婦連的「名流太太」們贊同這樣的主張嗎？而和「名流太太」的一貫的馬丁「夫人」，不是也說看「現已有計劃在建築學等專門智識技術上努力，蓋此種建設工作，女子較男子尤為適當，如花園，住房，廚灶間，廁所等設備，均以女子為最近於個性也」的話嗎？</p>
<p>不過，有種人雖在組織什麼「母親會」，想把婦女羣衆幽閉在所謂「天職」之內去做賢妻良母，而事實上大多數覺醒了的「中國婦女」却再也不聽這些鬼話了！</p>
<p>「中國婦女甚自由」！這在目前固然是談不到，但是我敢確信，祇要和她們同命運的團結在一起，一致地向應該走的道路走去，那麼「甚自由」的時日，是不會遠的！</p>
<h3 id="c228">韭菜 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>住在法租界，什麼都好，空氣淸，環境靜，不像公共租界早夜的弄堂，亂嘈嘈的使人難耐。　這裏也有一椿很不方便的事，就是一日兩頓飯食實在不容易解决。雖然有不少俄菜館，烹調口味到底很容易吃厭，而且經濟上也不太合算。我現在住在辣斐德路一個弄堂裏，一日兩頓飯餐幸得房東肯代包辦，這樣一來不單解决了許多麻煩，而更使我快意的是每天可以吃到各種新鮮的蔬菜。</p>
<p>在我的故鄉，一日三餐，蔬菜是主要的菜餚，都是當餐在菜園子裏採來的，田野風味，豐膩雖不足，那種特有的新鮮淸嫩的味見，可不是終日珍饈肉食的人所能想像得到。我之愛好蔬菜也許就是這種田野環境養成而來的。三春一季的蔬菜，我最愛吃的就是韭菜，它的一種香嫩鮮甜的風味，可說兼而有之。故鄉人有一句品評韭菜的俗話，說是：春香，夏辣，秋老澀。可以說是很切當的。我家菜園裏也闢有一角地方專種韭菜，不過母親總不許我多吃，理由為何，我也總不明白，也許是她的好潔癖，凡是稍帶點濃烈性質的東西就認為不好，比方酸辣之類她就始終不許我染指。</p>
<p>本來，韭菜雖說美味之至，但吃多了，口裏呼出來的氣確也刺鼻，欠雅一點，社交塲中難免見憎於人。然而照我現在所過的寂寞生活權衡起來，這點顧慮實在還用不着，矯揉作態又何必呢。</p>
<p>上海市攤上所賣的韭黃很為人愛吃，這種韭黃我總覺得鮮嫩有餘，味則嫌其太過濃烈，失了純厚的風味。韭黃本為古人蔬食珍品，陸放翁詩曾有：「鷄跖宜菰白，豚肩雜韭黃。」句：而「夜雨剪春韭」欵待故人的幽雅韻事，又是多末令人神往？至以晋，石崇與王愷二人之爭豪，而至以麥苗雜韭根為　齋供客，爭取一時之勝，益足以槪見古人珍</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>視韭黃的程度。但據我看來，上海市攤所賣的韭黃與古人所說的或有差異。本草云：韭根名韭黃，韭之美在黃，豪貴皆珍之。這裏所指的黃，實卽係故鄉人說的韭白，未必是上海市攤所見的那種韭黃也。這種韭黃故鄉不多見，原因味太烈不為人愛吃。其栽法係將韭葉齊根剪掉，覆以稻草，使茁出的嫩芽不見日光而成。故鄉栽種韭白的法子則係用稻灰高高覆在截齊的韭根上，再澆以肥料。韭白炒麵為故鄉時俗美食之一，嶺表天氣溫暖，仲春二月，新麥粉卽己上市，菜飯店裏的應時本土風味的韭菜炒麵，也趁着上市了。今則洋粉充斥市塲，本土麥麵已給淘汰殆盡，據說縣城只有一家老牌麵店還有土麥粉製的麵食可買，然人多趨尙新異，光顧的也怕只限一些懂得講究食味的顧客罷了。</p>
<p>我家雖有幾畝田地，但一年兩季的耕種也還不够一家十三四口的糧食，幸好地土氣候關係，各種雜糧，仍可種來，年中也可收到兩三石麥子，這一點麥子都只供自己食用，麥粉磨好担回來的那天，自然先要做麵嚐嚐新，韭菜炒麵也就少不得。不過家鄉吃麵只當點心吃罷了。重來海上，又是三年，因物思鄉，情懷自是彌深彌長的，而今幾時纔能吃到韭菜炒麵呢，想到這裏，心頭不禁黯然了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the Tianjin Customs' detention of the Hai Chang, a smuggling ship carrying goods for the puppet state, the ship sailed to Tianjin on the night of the 14th under the guidance of the customs and was detained at the wharf in Special Zone Three. The smuggled goods have been unloaded and stored in the customs warehouse. The customs fined the ship 100,000 yuan and confiscated the ship's cargo. On the 15th, Japanese military staff members Nakai and Dokyo, accompanied by Japanese customs officer Akatani of the Tianjin Customs, negotiated for its release without result. The Hai Chang is a 600-ton iron-hulled ship, used for both passenger and cargo transport. The ship is about 30 years old and belongs to the Hai Chang Company, which was established by Lu Hanqing, a Chinese businessman in the business sector. It used to sail the Yingkou-Yantai-Longkou route, but it has not been to Tianjin for several years. Last year, it was leased by a certain country's rogue and specialized in transporting smuggled goods, unloading them on the shore at Yanghekou and Beidaihe. The Qinhuangdao Customs was hesitant due to concerns and did not take action. Three days ago, it suddenly sailed to Tianjin, so the customs detained it. The Japanese Consul in Tianjin and the military department have both protested for its return. (15th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hai Chang wheel is registered with the Ministry of Communications of the puppet Manchukuo. Last year, the Datong Company in Tianjin acted as an agent to solicit passengers and cargo. This spring, the Nitto Kosho Line acted as an agent. Manager Lü Hanqing has appealed to the puppet state because the ship was detained. The Japanese consulate and military department in Tianjin have a firm attitude on this matter and demand its immediate return. (15th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>— Du</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city, in order to instill public health awareness among the general public and improve their daily lives, specially launched a city-wide clean-up campaign starting yesterday, scheduled for seven days, dividing the area into eleven sections. Participants include local officials, youth students, teams, military police, laborers, and strong men, all carrying baskets and brooms, sweeping and cleaning in the thoroughfares and alleys, and making announcements and exhortations in the homes and communities. The entire city is making a concerted effort to completely destroy and clean up. This can be said to be a magnificent event of the moment.</p>
<p>Maintaining cleanliness is the starting point of hygiene, and eliminating filth is the root of preventing disease. This is a fact that ordinary people easily understand. However, the general public often neglects this. Inside the house, dirt and grime fill the floor; outside, spitting and expectorating are arbitrary. The discarded dregs and leftovers in the neighborhoods are accumulated and scattered, and the residual food and spoiled soup in the ditches are strewn about. These are common phenomena that we see. These are all the hideouts of microbes and protozoa, the source of epidemic diseases and pestilence. Living in such an environment every day, how can people bear it? Although there are people with clear minds who aspire to improve, they ultimately feel the difficulty of one person being awake while everyone else is drunk, feeling the helplessness of one hand clapping, and being forced to practice self-preservation and not being able to do so, and ultimately drinking their sorrows and swallowing their voices, resigning themselves to fate. Now that the spring breeze is gentle, citizens are enjoying their time traveling and are unaware that the crawling things have already silently grown in the invisible. Taking advantage of the warming and cooling temperatures and using the nourishment of filth, it is not difficult to form various demonic appearances to fight with humanity. Our bodies inherently lack the anti-elements of gases. Once attacked by germs, we will be even more unable to stand up. With a dignified seven-foot body, to be completely subjugated by the smallest protozoa, is it not shameful for future generations?</p>
<p>Since the world's situation is becoming more complex day by day, and the state of things is increasingly intricate, with changes happening in an instant, the evolution of humanity is no longer something that can be understood with a superficial understanding. Advanced countries have used science to sharply develop and gradually conquer and use things as they please. However, the people of our country have always remained in the old ways, not knowing how to ask questions, and even the most basic awareness of hygiene has not been made known to every household. As for those above this, it goes without saying. For many years, those with broad vision have known that it is difficult to remain confined for long and have thought of invigorating themselves. They have also been running around, shouting loudly to awaken the ears and eyes of the people of the country. However, among those with shallow knowledge, there are still many who hold their own prejudices and recklessly defame others, or else quote absurd theories to deliberately show strangeness. To this day, the stagnation of general hygiene is still the same as before. Therefore, although the city-wide clean-up campaign is only held for seven days and the area is limited to one corner, with the local authorities as the advocate and using the power of administration to arouse the attention of the public and establish the foundation of hygiene, it is not enough to change customs and rescue the decline, and it can also change the customs and save the decline. Moreover, practicing cleanliness is only considered a local program by ordinary people, but from the perspective of those who study public health, it is a fundamental problem of hygiene. We dare not fail to pray sincerely for those who are engaged in the clean-up campaign to continue to strive to cultivate a firm atmosphere in order to promote the success of public health.</p>
<h3 id="e12">Shanghai West Electricity Business <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The Saying That the Term of Business Is Changed Is Not Accurate</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In January of the 24th year, the Mayor of Shanghai and the Shanghai West Electric Power Company signed an exclusive power supply agreement for the electrical business of the Shanghai West Over-Boundary Road. Recently, Chinese and foreign newspapers have reported that the Executive Yuan held a meeting to review and consider shortening the term of business stipulated in the contract. The results of interviews with relevant parties are as follows: The Shanghai West Electric Power Company was organized because of the recovery of sovereignty in the power supply section of the Over-Boundary Road area. It is contracted by American businessmen, and it is also a parent-subsidiary company with the Shanghai Electric Power Company in the Public Concession. However, the Shanghai West Company should be guided and supervised by our country's local authorities in the Over-Boundary Road and pay 5%. The content was not announced at the time. According to information from the Construction Committee, the saying that the term is changed has not been heard and has not been discussed. It is found that the contract stipulates a term of 30 years, which will expire at the end of December of the 53rd year of the Republic of China. The method is to notify the Shanghai West Electric Power Company three years before the expiration date whether to take over the business separately. If no notification is given by the end of December of the 50th year of the Republic of China, the term will be extended for ten years, and it is still necessary to notify three years in advance whether to take over the business separately. Since this term of business has been signed, it cannot be considered to be shortened at this time. As for the water and electricity supply in the Zhabei Hongkou North Sichuan Road Over-Boundary Road area, which was previously supplied by the Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession, it was agreed that the Zhabei Company would take over the water and electricity part of the North Sichuan Road Over-Boundary Road area after the Shanghai West Company signed the contract. The company is gradually recovering, and most of it has been completed. It can be completely taken over in the short term. As for the 5% profit paid by the Shanghai West Company to the municipal government last year, the amount is less than that of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The previous review meeting of the Executive Yuan for the registration part of the contract only discussed the procedural issue, and there was no discussion on the contract itself. It is also reported that the Wusong Water and Electricity will also be recovered. According to the Wusong Water and Electricity, it is operated by Chinese people, and there is no need to recover it.

<p>(Taiyuan) The bandits in Hejin and Jishan counties, commanded by Lin Biao, were severely attacked by our army yesterday and fled to Xiangning County. Yang Chengyuan telegraphed at noon on the 14th that our Liu Brigade had contacted the bandits at Linshan Temple, more than 30 miles south of Xiangning, and had indeed killed more than 800 bandits. Our reinforcements in Jishan and Hejin have all arrived and are still surrounding and suppressing them. There are still more than 1,000 bandits in the villages of Dishizhuangtou, on the border of Hejin and Jishan. After being suppressed by the 89th Division yesterday, the bandits were defeated and fled west to Wang Village, crossed the river north, killed more than 200 bandits, captured 50 or 60, and seized a lot of weapons. The bandits of Zhongyang Xu Liu's faction have been surrounded and suppressed by our army for several days, and they have split into small groups again, dividing into three factions. Our army is suppressing them severely in different ways. The Xiangling county seat was attacked by bandits before, and the losses were quite heavy. The county magistrate, Kang Xiaomin, found 20 shopkeepers to guarantee his life and was spared from death. He has now returned to his post. The chief of the Public Security Bureau, Zhu Baoyu, died in the line of duty. The county is preparing for a memorial service and requesting compensation. (15th Special Telegram)</p>

Gao said that his troops are currently stationed in Wubao, Qingjian, and Suide, with a transportation line of 500 miles, which is maintained by his division. They are currently organizing the people to store grain and set up villages, so the communist bandits cannot disturb them. The bandits in northern Shaanxi are from Liu Zidan's faction, about 3,000 people. The saying that they have all fled to Shanxi is not accurate. Only more than 1,000 people have entered Shanxi. His army is searching for and suppressing the remaining bandits and hopes to eliminate them. In addition, they have blocked cloth, paper, salt, matches, and other items, and the bandits are greatly panicked. (15th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Sun Ke Appointed Legislators to Discuss Concrete Measures</p>
<p>Using Government Power to Organize Rural Cooperatives</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, in view of the collapse of our country's rural economy due to the inability of farmers to be self-sufficient, and the reason for the inability of farmers to be self-sufficient is that they have no land to cultivate, no good technology to apply, and no sufficient capital to turn around. However, the problems of land, tools, and technology are more difficult to solve. If the problem of capital can be solved with appropriate methods and given universal relief, it will not be difficult for farmers to restore their minimum self-sufficient life. After careful consideration, it is believed that in order to solve the problem of capital for Chinese farmers today, we should follow the principle of cooperation and use the power of the government to comprehensively plan rural credit, farmer production and sales, and farmer consumption cooperatives, so that farmers can receive universal relief. He has already appointed Liang Hancao, Fu Bingchang, Ma Yinchu, Wu Shangying, Wu Jingxiong, Chen Changheng, Lou Tongsun, Yao Chuanfa, and other legislators to be responsible for studying concrete implementation measures based on the above principles. Liang and others held their first research meeting in the hospital at 2:00 p.m. on the 15th and decided to study in three parts: 1. The establishment of the cooperative system; 2. The investigation and union of existing cooperative businesses; 3. The problem of raising farmers' working capital. And it is limited to be completed in a short period of time, so that it can be reported back to Sun and submitted to the National Economic Committee for approval and implementation. Sun gave a detailed speech on the motivation for preparing for this matter on the 15th. (15th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

Regarding the transitional clauses, it is said that they will be listed in the chapter on supplementary rules. However, the name of the chapter on supplementary rules must be revised.

<p>(London) It is reported that Prime Minister Baldwin met with former Ambassador to France Lord Tyrrell today to discuss the most serious problems encountered by British foreign policy since the European War. Since 1945, Tyrrell has been a central figure in every national crisis. During his six years as Ambassador to France, he received five honors. Consulting with him shows that he is a behind-the-scenes force in British foreign policy. It is reported that Tyrrell advocates concentrating British diplomatic efforts to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and seek a truce negotiation to avoid other provocative actions that could endanger peace. A spokesperson for the British government told a reporter from the Associated Press today that the government's future efforts will be focused on compromise. At the same time, an Italian spokesperson said that General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, has decided to make one final strike to force Ethiopia to surrender. Relations between Britain and Italy have reached their most critical point since British warships concentrated in the Mediterranean last September. Although the Geneva sanctions camp seems to be softening, the opinions of Britain and France have become increasingly divergent in recent days. Rumors here say that France has requested Britain to guarantee the security of the Austrian border as the price for France taking a strong action against Italy. At the end of last week's consultations, Baldwin and Eden opposed military sanctions, and one faction of the cabinet believed that Italy now has a large oil reserve, rendering the League of Nations oil embargo useless.

<p>Must Achieve the Goal of Ruling Ethiopia, Regardless of Any Oppression</p>
<p>(Rome) According to today's news, Mussolini has decided to disregard the actions of Britain and the League of Nations to pressure Italy to accept its peace plan for Ethiopia. Mussolini's intention is that unless Ethiopia completely surrenders and accepts Italy's permanent rule, it will never stop its troops' advancing. At the same time, if Britain takes a threatening attitude again, Mussolini will reject all peace proposals. Italians now believe that the countries imposing sanctions on Italy are now divided, and it is difficult to establish new sanctions anyway. Moreover, since last December, Italy's kerosene reserves have increased rather than decreased, increasing the confidence of the average Italian. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, before April, Mussolini was quite uneasy, but today he is convinced that final victory within one or two months will belong to Italy. Therefore, he is increasingly confident in the correctness of his actions in Ethiopia. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources here, Italy will not participate in any consultations on the Lake Tana issue, because from now on, Italy regards this place as its own property and will never easily give up land occupied by military force. Therefore, according to this source, Italy will not cede this lake to Britain. Italy's only step is to issue a declaration stating that it will never hastily modify existing regulations in a way that harms British or Egyptian interests. Political circles here express extreme skepticism about future peace negotiations in Geneva, because the Italian military operations in Ethiopia are becoming increasingly smooth. Newspapers here all publish opinions criticizing Britain's attitude, especially regarding the British proposal to convene an 18-nation committee to discuss strengthening sanctions. Regarding this point, all newspapers unanimously assert that under such a threatening situation, Italy will not participate in any consultations. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Eden is scheduled to go to Geneva tomorrow afternoon to attend the meeting of the League of Nations' Committee of Thirteen. He had a special consultation with Prime Minister Baldwin tonight. The cabinet will hold an emergency meeting tomorrow so that it can give Foreign Secretary Eden concrete instructions before his departure. As is generally known, the cabinet's attitude towards the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has not changed, and the alarming news reported in the newspapers is unreliable. At this time, officials at the Foreign Office are not too optimistic about the peace situation between Italy and Ethiopia, but they believe that Italy's economic and financial situation is quite difficult, and if a glorious solution can be found, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will be happy to accept it. As for the scope of the future solution, Foreign Office personnel are absolutely tight-lipped, because the Laval-Hoare plan proposed last December caused a strong reaction after it was fully published. At this time, it is better to be cautious. If the negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia can agree on a solution that is acceptable to both parties, and then publish it, even if there is a reaction in public opinion, it will not be too intense. Political figures believe that if the attempts at reconciliation by the Committee of Thirteen fail, the British government will be based on the principles passed by the House of Commons after Foreign Secretary Eden's recent speech. The principles are "No matter what resolution the 18-nation sub-committee (i.e., the one dealing with the sanctions issue) adopts, Britain will support it." However, this principle is broad in nature, and the British government can choose not to propose this motion if it has no intention of intensifying sanctions against Italy. Generally speaking, Foreign Secretary Eden's final attitude will be based on the attitude adopted in Geneva and will follow the lead of most countries. Senior British officials believe that the outcome of the war in Ethiopia has been decided, and even if sanctions are intensified, it will have no impact. However, if the current sanctions can be maintained or the threat of intensifying them is used to threaten Italy, the attitude of the Italian delegation can be slightly moderated. This is especially credible. (Havas Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The League of Nations Administrative Council's Committee of Thirteen is scheduled to meet tomorrow afternoon to discuss the issue of peace negotiations between Italy and Ethiopia. If the committee's reconciliation efforts fail, then the League of Nations General Assembly's 18-nation subcommittee may convene a meeting to discuss the issue of intensifying sanctions against Italy. Therefore, the situation in Geneva is very tense. What attitude France will take at that time will be decided by Prime Minister Sarraut, Foreign Minister Flandin, and Minister without Portfolio Ponguet at a meeting to be held this afternoon. Several experts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also be present to provide consultation. The importance of the meeting can be seen from this. Prime Minister Sarraut is also scheduled to deliver a non-commercial radio broadcast speech on foreign policy at 8:15 tonight.</p>
<p>According to the "Morning Post," the French delegation in Geneva will do its utmost to mediate between the views of Italy and Ethiopia and the views of Britain and other member states of the League of Nations in order to establish a compromise that will harmonize the conflicting interests of all parties, so that the Italian-Ethiopian dispute can be resolved more easily. Only after the reconciliation efforts fail can the consideration of intensifying sanctions against Italy be considered. (Havas Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Thirteenth Committee of Nations to Continue Meeting Today <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Italian Representative Aloisi to Attend</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Council's Thirteenth Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting tomorrow afternoon (Thursday) to discuss the peace issue between Italy and Abyssinia. The exact attitude Italy will take at that time remains uncertain. The Italian representative, Aloisi, is expected to arrive here at 4:50 PM today and will meet with the Chairman of the Thirteenth Committee, the Spanish representative Madariaga. According to some sources, tensions between Britain and Italy have greatly eased, and the Italo-Abyssinian dispute will be resolved within the shortest possible time. However, another report states that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's instructions to Aloisi are to inquire about the intentions of the Thirteenth Committee, rather than to explain Italy's attitude. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Matin" newspaper's correspondent in Rome recently declared that there are rumors that Britain and Italy have begun direct talks, hoping to ease current tensions between the two countries through mutual concessions. Italian officials have refused to comment on these rumors, but stated that Prime Minister's private secretary, Aloisi, went to Geneva yesterday to represent the Italian government in negotiations, and there is no one else besides him. As for the rumor that the Italian government is unwilling to negotiate with the Thirteenth Committee, this is absolutely not true. If Prime Minister Mussolini had such intentions, he would not have accepted the invitation of the Thirteenth Committee, and inviting Madariaga to Italy for a face-to-face meeting, as well as sending Aloisi to Geneva, would also be redundant. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The delay of the Italian representative Aloisi's arrival by twenty-four hours has caused a bad impression here. Italy now seems to be adopting a delaying and obstructive attitude, and shifting the responsibility for any resolution to the Thirteenth Committee. However, the Chairman of the Committee, Madariaga, is still determined to hold a meeting on Thursday afternoon to discuss a peaceful resolution to the East African war, and will not postpone the meeting due to the late arrival of the Italian representative. This shows that Madariaga does not want to be swayed by Italy's delaying tactics. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Chairman of the League of Nations Council's Thirteenth Committee, Madariaga, had discussions last night with the Abyssinian Minister to France, Watte, on the current situation of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Abyssinia's advisors, Professor Scialoja of the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris and Auberson (Swiss citizen, currently serving as the liaison between the Abyssinian delegation to the League of Nations and the Abyssinian Emperor) who was a former advisor to the Abyssinian Emperor, were also present.

League of Nations officials believe that it is too early to say what decision the committee will make on the sanctions issue at that time. Whether they will advocate maintaining, intensifying, or abolishing the current sanctions will depend on the progress of the peace negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia. (Havas, 15th)</p>

The last four attacks were the fierce bombing of Guaran from April 4th to 7th, where gas filled the trenches, much of it of a poisonous nature. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, recently received a note signed by the Italian Foreign Minister, Suvich, stating that the slave system in the Abyssinian territories occupied by the Italian army has been abolished by order of the Italian authorities. The note also cited a recent proclamation by General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, as evidence. The proclamation stated: "The slave system is a relic of ancient barbarism, and it will not be allowed to continue to exist wherever the Italian flag flies. The Commander-in-Chief hereby orders that all slave trading activities are prohibited, and that all slaves in Teltgli, Galla, and Amhara shall be restored to their freedom from this day forward." (Note: The League of Nations Committee on Slavery Issues is scheduled to meet here tomorrow.)

<p>(Rome) News received here today indicates that Italian troops have occupied Dessie, the location of the Abyssinian King's headquarters. A guerrilla detachment of the First Army Corps entered the town this morning, and it is reported that the main force will follow. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, High Commissioner of Italian East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Forces, recently issued Communiqué No. 185, stating, "Italian troops on the northern front entered the city of Dessie this morning." Military sources believe that Italian troops could reach the Abyssinian capital within a few days, as the roads leading from Dessie to the capital are currently in good condition, allowing for rapid advancement. It is also believed that the troops led by General Graziani on the southern front may arrive in the capital at the same time as the northern troops, or even before. Dessie is located 150 kilometers south of Guaran and 250 kilometers north of the capital. It was originally an important strategic location, and in the last two years, it has become the military center of Abyssinia under the advice of foreign military advisors, with barracks, ammunition depots, gunpowder depots, airfields, and modern hospitals being established in succession. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The reporter of the Italian Stefani News Agency stationed at the Italian army headquarters in the war zone telegraphed today, reporting the fall of Quoram and stating that the days of the Abyssinian Empire are now numbered. The Italian army traveled white li between Guaran and Quoram in nine days. The motorized vanguard first arrived at the destination and surrounded the town on three sides last night. Although the garrison in the town seemed to have retreated, the vanguard did not dare to enter lightly due to their small numbers. Two armed automobile teams arrived this morning and entered the town without resistance, raising the Italian flag over the royal palace. The motor road to the Abyssinian capital, 160 miles long, is now open for entry. According to air reconnaissance reports, the Abyssinian capital seems to be an empty city, with no troops defending it. Rome today celebrated the recent victory of the Italian army. The Italian commander-in-chief in East Africa, Badoglio, is expected to occupy the Abyssinian capital on April 21st, the anniversary of Rome's founding. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Strict Secrecy Maintained; Limited to Technical Matters, No Political Significance</p>
<p>(London) The general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium held their first meeting this morning at the British Admiralty. Strict secrecy was maintained throughout. After a brief adjournment, they reconvened in the afternoon. All actions were aimed at simplicity to avoid public attention, so none of the representatives wore uniforms. The British delegation consisted of eight people, while France and Belgium each had only two. The "Times" newspaper commented today that the Italian government is standing by and watching the London draft. There has been no question of inviting the Italian general staff to send a representative to the meeting. Although this discussion currently has no practical relevance, the move is primarily intended as a warning rather than an exclusion, but there is no difference in spirit. Any dispassionate analysis would clearly show that as Italian power expands elsewhere, its power in Europe will necessarily weaken. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The discussions that the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium are supposed to conduct in accordance with the Locarno Treaty began this morning at 10:30 AM at the Admiralty.

<p>(London) The discussions that the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium are supposed to hold in accordance with the Locarno Treaty are scheduled to begin at 11:30 AM tomorrow at the Admiralty. Rear Admiral James, Deputy Chief of Naval Staff of the British Navy, will preside. At that time, representatives from the general staffs of the three countries' naval, land, and air forces will hold a plenary meeting. However, they may then be divided into naval, land, and air groups for individual discussions. The procedure for the discussions has not yet been decided. The representatives from the general staffs of France and Belgium arrived here separately this afternoon. Responsible parties have reiterated that these discussions are being held within the scope stipulated in Article 3 of the Locarno Treaty, and the nature of the discussion will be limited to purely technical matters and will not contain any political significance.

Troops escorted the hearse, carrying arms reversed, and played mournful music. The coffin was placed on a gun carriage, draped with a Nazi flag. The gun carriage was pulled by six horses, followed by German officials in uniform. An eleven-gun salute was fired at the funeral. The pallbearers were Bismarck, the Counselor of the German Embassy, and British representatives Foreign Secretary Eden, Home Secretary Simon, and First Sea Lord Monsell. Many diplomats attended the funeral, including the ambassadors of Italy, France, and the United States, all dressed in formal attire. Finally, several hundred German students followed at the rear. At the station platform, British soldiers welcomed them with music. As the train left the station, the Germans performed the Nazi salute, and the military band played the German national anthem. The train carried many wreaths sent by diplomats. When the train arrived in Dover, the coffin was transferred to a British destroyer to be transported to Wilhelmshaven for burial. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Fukuoka: Eighty-two workers from the No. 7 mine shaft of the Sumitomo Tadakuma coal mine in Fukuoka Prefecture boarded ten mine cars at 6:00 AM on the 15th to go into the shaft for work. While they were working, the iron chain connecting the hoisting cable suddenly broke, and the ten cars started moving automatically. Because there was no hoisting cable, they could not be stopped, and they rushed into the mine shaft at a violent speed, reaching 300 fathoms inside, violently crashing into the bottom of the shaft. Most of the workers were crushed. According to the latest investigation, there were a total of 83 people who entered the shaft, of which 54 died tragically and 28 were seriously injured.

<h3 id="e61">Return from London Exhibition: Our Country's Antiquities Transported to Gibraltar; British Ship Aground Remains in Danger; Naval Tugboats Repeatedly Rescue Without Success; But Ambassador Quo Reports That They Have Been Secured <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Reports indicate that the British merchant ship "Lympura," which was transporting our antiquities back to China, encountered a sudden gale on the northwest coast of Gibraltar and was nearly wrecked. Wang Shijie received a telegram from Quo Tai-chi on the 15th stating that after learning of the ship's encounter with the gale, he immediately inquired with the British Admiralty and the shipping company, who said that it was now safely out of danger. (Central News Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The British liner "Lympura", carrying Chinese art worth £20 million from England back to Shanghai, ran aground outside Gibraltar harbor yesterday. Passengers and their luggage have landed safely, but the ship has not yet been refloated. Towing was ineffective and has been suspended overnight. Efforts to refloat her will resume at 6 a.m. London art circles, hearing the news of the grounding, are very concerned about the Chinese treasures on board. The London headquarters of the British Steamship Company stated that the company's "Balapool," sailing from England to Australia, has been ordered to moor alongside the "Lympura". If necessary, the "Balapool" will carry the "Lympura's" emergency passengers to Marseille. However, the saying that the Chinese art would be transferred to the "Balapool" is not true, as the "Lympura" is not considered to be in danger. The "Lympura" seems to have weighed anchor after the first tugboat carrying passengers had departed and run aground in a dangerous place called Punta Mala. The ship's bow faces the shore, 5 miles northwest of Gibraltar and 500 miles from the Spanish coast. The ship sailed from London on Friday. When she ran aground, the British destroyer "Whitshed" was escorting her. Initially, the tugboat was unable to approach the ship, causing the passengers who had already landed to be inconvenienced by the inability to transport their luggage. However, before long, all the passengers' luggage had been transported ashore. The British Navy tugboats "Larkspur" and "Rollock", and a naval gunnery tugboat, all sailed to assist, but were unable to move the grounded ship. The "Lympura" attempted to extricate herself from the predicament using her own steam power, but to no avail. At that time, the wind was very strong, and all ships in the harbor sent personnel to special lookout to prevent the anchors from dragging. Later, the weather improved, and the "Lympura's" passengers were able to land safely. According to the report of the British authorities in Gibraltar, the "Lympura" arrived at the harbor at 11:00 a.m. yesterday and dropped anchor outside the harbor. Two hours later, she sent a wireless message requesting a tugboat to assist. The area where she ran aground is sandy, but the strong wind has caused difficulties. Although the Chinese treasures carried on the "Lympura" are not insured, the London overdue market for shipping vessels has only opened a minimum price of 5 guineas per hundred for the reinsurance of the ship itself, showing that the insurance industry does not consider the ship's situation to be serious. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Steamship Company stated definitively this afternoon that the Chinese art will remain on the "Lympura" and will not be transferred to another ship. As far as is known, the ship has not been damaged. It is expected that the ship can be refloated when a portion of the cargo is unloaded. It is expected that the Chinese treasures will only be a few days late in returning to Chinese ports. All of the ship's Far Eastern mail will be carried by the "Balapool" to Colombo, and then transferred to the company's "Sultan" to carry to the Far East. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The British Admiralty today informed Zheng Tianxi that the Admiralty will make every effort to ensure the safety of the Chinese antiquities on board the "Lympura". (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Tugboats attempted to refloat the "Lympura" at high tide this morning, but were unsuccessful. The wind and waves were strong, and the tugboats could not get close, so the towing operation was suspended. The British Navy tugboats "Larkspur" and "Rollock" were slightly damaged today. However, the salvage vessel "Gere" has sailed from Lisbon to provide assistance. The British Steamship Company's "Labrador" has turned back to Gibraltar this morning after receiving instructions from headquarters and will carry the "Lympura's" passengers who landed yesterday to Marseilles. The matter of transferring the Chinese antiquities is currently under consideration. The London headquarters of the British Steamship Company learned that the "Lympura" was not damaged and had been inspected and was not leaking. After being refloated, she will be inspected underwater by personnel dispatched to Gibraltar. It is estimated that this ship will not need to enter dry dock. Company officials stated that the Chinese antiquities are placed in a special compartment and can be easily removed without danger if necessary. They also said that the company's "Egypt" sank off Ushant in 1922, and the cargo in its special compartment was salvaged ten years later and remained undamaged. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The grounding of the British Steamship Company's "Lympura" outside Gibraltar is causing anxiety because the ship is carrying extremely valuable Chinese art. Today, all newspapers published news of the ship's grounding in large print, and interest in the news of the Italo-Abyssinian peace negotiations was almost completely overshadowed. Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi and Commissioner Zheng Tianxi initially thought that the antiquities were safely loaded on the "Lympura" and could rest easy, but now they are gathered in the embassy office, waiting for telegrams from Gibraltar. An official of the British Steamship Company told a Reuters reporter today that although the place where the "Lympura" ran aground has always been known as a dangerous place, it is the main route used by all large ships. The current incident is unfortunate, but the Chinese government does not need to be alarmed. The gale that is currently passing is referred to by officials as a force five wind. Once the wind subsides slightly, the "Lympura" will be able to get out of danger quickly. As for the idea of transferring the antiquities to another ship, it is absurd and unnecessary. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The mail ship "Lympura", loaded with various antiquities from the Chinese Art Exhibition and transported back to China, ran aground outside Gibraltar harbor yesterday. The "Daily Express" newspaper recently received a wireless message from Tang Xifen, an official of the American Exhibition who was escorting the ship, saying, "A gale has been blowing for two days. The situation is now better, and all the antiquities on board are safe." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Officials at the Chinese Embassy here were all shocked when they heard the news of the ship's mishap. Dr. Zheng Tianxi, commissioner of the American Exhibition, recently told people that if these antiquities were damaged or lost, they could not be compensated. Another official of the exhibition said that some of the antiquities, such as bronze artifacts, are from ancient times, some over 4,000 years old. When the decision was made last year to transport them to England, some people in China opposed the move, because these antiquities are priceless. If half of them are destroyed, the loss will be immeasurable. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways' method for gradually reducing through transport freight rates was revised at the end of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), stipulating a 1% reduction for every 100 kilometers beyond 301 kilometers, up to 2,500 kilometers, where the reduction would reach 22%. To allow through transport goods to enjoy greater price reductions, the gradual reduction rate has been revised to a 2% reduction starting from 301 kilometers, followed by a 1% reduction for every 100 kilometers, up to 1,000 kilometers, resulting in an 8% reduction. For distances exceeding 1,001 kilometers, a 2% reduction will be applied for every 200 kilometers. For freight exceeding 2,401 kilometers, a uniform 25% reduction will be applied.

<p>(Hangzhou) The Provincial and Municipal Chambers of Commerce and the Banking Guild held a joint meeting today to discuss opinions on the Provincial Government's proposed issuance of 60 million yuan of reorganization public bonds. As a result, three resolutions were made: (1) It is still hoped that the government will revise the reorganization plan, re-examine it, either postpone the reduction of interest or reduce the interest without postponing the term. (2) Regarding the loan portion, the government should be requested to respect the contract and not change it casually. (3) To fundamentally solve the financial difficulties of the province, the Ministry of Finance should be telegraphed to promptly re-divide the existing tax revenues of Zhejiang Province in order to adapt to all current expenditures, and first allocate the existing funds owed to Zhejiang Province by the central government, and then allocate a large batch of bonds to Zhejiang for application. The Provincial Government believes that the above three items are not solutions, so it has asked the association to reconsider. Director of the Department of Finance Cheng Yuanfan returned to Hangzhou from Nanjing today.

<h3 id="e96">The Course of Xiao and He's Bandit Gang's Disturbance in Guizhou <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Four Months of Disturbing Over Twenty Counties, Fleeing Westward into Yunnan Province, Hoping to Join Forces with Zhu and Xu</p>
<p>Guizhou Correspondence: The Xiao and He bandit gang, on January 4th of this year, broke out of Xiangxi and captured Yuping, marking the beginning of their invasion of Guizhou. By April 2nd, they had all fled westward into Yunnan via Panxian. Lasting for four months, their course and intention for fleeing into Yunnan are matters of concern for the public. Therefore, a summary of the suppression of bandits in Guizhou Province in recent months is outlined below.</p>
<p>Bandit Numbers Entering Guizhou: In November of last year, the Xiao and He bandit gang suffered heavy losses after breaking through the blockade line in western Hunan. They reorganized their forces, including three divisions of He Long's pseudo-Second Army Corps, each with three regiments, and two divisions of Xiao Ke's pseudo-Sixth Army Corps, each with three regiments, for a total of fifteen regiments. Their strength was around 20,000, with fewer than 10,000 firearms. This was the actual strength of the bandits when they entered Guizhou.</p>
<p>National Army Deployment: At the time, the troops stationed in Guizhou included the two columns of Hao Mengling and Guo Siyan, comprising four divisions, and a small number of troops responsible for city defense. The defense was deployed in the Wujiang River and Sichuan-Guizhou Road area, undertaken by the Hao column, and the area from Guidong Road to the Hunan-Guizhou border, undertaken by the Guo column. The distance was far and the military strength was weak. However, since the reinforcements were too far away at the time, this was the only possible deployment. After the bandits attacked Yuping, they intended to attack Cengong to the west. However, due to the tight deployment of the National Army in the Zhenyuan area, they headed north to Jiangkou via Zhujia. He Long led his troops west to Shiqian.</p>
<p>The Course of the Encirclement and Suppression: At this time, the pursuit troops led by Li Jue and Tao Guang followed and pressed from Yuping. Jiang Zaizhen's division attacked from Tongren, and Fan Songfu's division pursued from Fenghuang and Songtao. The bandits were unable to return to their old nest according to their original plan. Xiao Long led his troops to feign a northward advance towards Yinren, luring the pursuing troops towards Jiangkou. On January 20th, He Long led his troops westward from Shiqian in a swift advance. They were intercepted by the National Army's 23rd Division in Longxi, but were eventually broken through due to insufficient military strength. On the 24th, they captured Wengan, and on the 25th, they captured Pingyue. Commissioner Gong Hong died in action, and the city was looted. At this time, Guo's column had returned from Zhenyuan, Huangping, and Yuqing to Guiyang. He Long then marched all his troops to Mapingchang, hoping to defeat Guo's column and then invade Guiyang from the west. At 9:00 AM on the 26th, the bandits began to engage Guo's troops, fighting fiercely all day. After three rounds of hand-to-hand combat, they were fortunately defeated, allowing all of the National Army to pass through and hold the area around Guiding and Longli. Guiyang was thus preserved.</p>
<p>Fleeing Westward to Qianxi: Frustrated, the bandits failed in their plans. They then fled westward in separate groups from the Wudang, Shuitianba, Huchang, and Yangchang areas in the northwest. At this time, only two battalions of the security regiment were guarding Zazuo. As a result, the company commanders and below were almost completely killed or injured. On the 30th, Zazuo also fell, and on February 1st, Xiuwen fell. The bandits crossed the Wujiang River from Yachi, Liuguangdu, and Wujiang, and between the 3rd and 12th, roamed through various counties of Qian, Da, and Bi. At this time, the commander of the headquarters, Gu Zhutong, arrived in Guiyang to direct the suppression. The troops of Guo Siyan, Li Jue, and Guo Runan successively followed and pursued. The bandits were in a state of panic, and all their plans could not be realized. They then received a false order from the Central Committee that since they could not reach southern Sichuan, they should also go to northern Guizhou and seek to communize the border area between Sichuan and Yunnan. However, after the National Army crossed the Yachi River, the Wan, Hao, and Fan columns also rushed up from northern Guizhou. On February 14th, the Hao column surrounded the bandits at Daguxinchang. On March 4th, the bandits were intercepted again by the Wan column in Qianxi. They fled again to Bijie, and were surrounded by the Wan, Hao, and Fan divisions. After several fierce battles, the remnants of the bandits could no longer stay. They then used their old trick of circling around, hoping to lure the National Army to Weining and then flee back, or flee to southern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Fierce Battles: The bandits' conspiracy was detected by the military authorities, who ordered the troops of Yang Sen and Xu Shaozong to hold Gaoqi and Xuyong, and Sun Du's troops to defend Zhaotong and Weining. The bandits were not able to succeed. On March 9th, they fled back to Zhenxiong. On the 10th, all of He Long's troops encountered the Wan column between Dezhangba and Taoyuan. After a day of fierce fighting, the bandits suffered heavy casualties. They then joined forces with Xiao Long and fled west. They were ambushed by the Sun and Wan columns between Xiantoushan and Weining Xuanwei from March 21st to 24th. After more than ten rounds of hand-to-hand combat, the bandits suffered more than 2,000 casualties, representing their biggest loss since fleeing Hunan to Guizhou. At this time, the military authorities judged that the bandits had suffered heavy losses and would surely go to Panxian to reorganize before making other plans. At the same time, it was expected that they would flee west into Yunnan, so the Yunnan army was ordered to hold the Beipan River area, and the Guangxi army was ordered to hold the Nanpan River area, sealing the bandits between the North and South Pan Rivers. On March 28th, the bandits arrived in Panxian and immediately felt the danger, so they accelerated their flight to the vicinity of Pingyi and Qujing. They have now fled to Xundian, north of Qujing and Kunming. In total, since entering Guizhou, the bandits have suffered casualties and losses in battle, and their strength has been reduced by one-third compared to when they first entered Guizhou.</p>
<p>Future Plans: Judging from the current situation, the bandits' plans are limited to two: (1) Following the old path of Zhu De and Mao Zedong into Sichuan, sneaking across the upper reaches of the Jinsha River, and joining Zhu and Mao in Huili. (2) Going to western Yunnan and then trying to flee back to the Pan River, or Qian, Da, and Bi. However, the National Army has tight deployments in the Qian, Bi, and Pan counties, so it is difficult for the bandits to flee back. Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong flew to Kunming on the 7th to meet with Yunnan Chairman Long Yun to discuss military affairs for suppressing the bandits. From now on, the focus of military affairs for suppressing the bandits should be shifted to the provinces of Yunnan and Sichuan. (April 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e97">Chairman of Gansu Province Yu Xuezhong: A Glimpse of Concern for the People <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Allocating Funds to Relieve the Disaster Area in the West</p>
<p>Ordering Counties to Strictly Prohibit Sending Personnel to the Countryside</p>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Chairman of the Provincial Government Yu Xuezhong, based on reports that the disaster situation in the counties of the west is extremely severe, specially sent Director of the Department of Civil Affairs Liu to inspect. According to the director's telegram from Jiuquan, the disaster situation in the western counties is indeed dire. The number of people who have died has exceeded 4,000, and relief is urgently needed to save lives. Three methods were proposed and resolved in the provincial government meeting to allocate 10,000 yuan to Director Liu for disaster relief nearby. The three methods are as follows: (1) Order the Gansu Province Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee to allocate 10,000 yuan immediately to handle emergency relief in the western counties where the disaster situation is extremely severe, and remit it to Director Liu for distribution to disaster-stricken households at low interest rates nearby. (2) Telegraph the Executive Yuan's Central Relief Committee to allocate funds for relief.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Chairman Yu, based on reports from Yumen and Anxi counties that the disaster situation was extremely severe and requested relief, submitted it to the provincial government meeting, which resolved to hand it over to the departments of civil affairs and finance for deliberation on methods. It is now learned that the two departments have jointly formulated five methods, which have been submitted to the provincial government meeting for approval and implementation. The provincial government has also ordered the counties to comply separately.</p>
<p>Gansu Province has suffered from banditry for many years, rural areas are bankrupt, and local areas are devastated beyond description. Chairman Yu of the Provincial Government recently reported that the county governments often send personnel to the countryside for trivial matters, arbitrarily extorting and oppressing the people, which is highly inappropriate. He has strictly ordered the county magistrates to ensure that personnel are not arbitrarily dispatched to the countryside in the future unless it is a matter of importance. If there are important events, they must also carefully select virtuous personnel and strictly restrain the police. If extortion occurs again, the county magistrate will be held jointly responsible, and the public is allowed to report at any time for thorough punishment.</p>

<p>Kong Xiangrong to Come to Shandong to Discuss Implementation</p>
<p>Peach Flood Season Has Arrived, River Water in Shandong Territory Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, the Yellow River has repeatedly breached and flooded. In addition to Guantai Fenglou, there was also Dongzhuang last year. Not only does it cost millions of yuan in state funds, but the local losses are even incalculable. Experts in river management believe that the silting up of the estuary and the unsmooth discharge is the biggest reason. Han Fuqu, chairman of Shandong Province, telegraphed the Executive Yuan earlier, stating that the lower reaches of the Yellow River have repeatedly breached and flooded. He proposed to dredge the estuary by conscripting laborers according to the method of conscripting labor service to facilitate discharge. The Executive Yuan then sent a letter to the National Economic Commission for review and reply. The Economic Commission believed that the dredging of the estuary was feasible. In addition to replying to the Executive Yuan, it also telegraphed Kong Xiangrong, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, to send personnel to Shandong to discuss the implementation with the Shandong Provincial Government in detail. The Executive Yuan has now instructed the provincial government to convene a joint meeting with the personnel sent by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to discuss the matter as soon as they arrive, and to report the details of the discussion. The Provincial Government has handed this over to the Department of Construction for handling. According to a telegram from Kaifeng, Kong Xiangrong has entered Nanjing to report to the central government on the process of blocking the breaches. On his return journey to Jinan, he will discuss the dike restoration and follow-up projects with Chairman Han. In the future, there will also be detailed consultations on dredging the estuary. If it is completed before the major flood, the Yellow River can be said to be safe this year. Furthermore, the peach flood season has arrived, and the upstream of Shandong Province is rising. Kangtun has risen by one meter, and Zhukou has risen by seven centimeters. Director of the River Affairs Bureau Zhang Lianjia has reported to the provincial government and telegraphed all section chiefs to take strict precautions after receiving reports from the upstream section chiefs.

<p>Establishing Agricultural Warehouses to Regulate Production and Sales</p>
<p>Provincial Treasury to be Taken Over by Local Banks</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: In order to stabilize the financial situation of the province, to engage in economic construction, and to seek to regulate the production and sales of agricultural products, the Anhui Provincial Government, after establishing the Anhui Provincial Local Bank, is actively preparing to establish branches in various important cities and counties, and offices in various counties and towns. The Tunxi and Bengbu branches will both be opened within this month. Sixteen offices in Xuancheng and Dangtu will also be completed by May. The provincial treasury has decided to be taken over by the Provincial Local Bank from May 1st. In the future, the general treasury will also be set up in Anqing, and branch treasuries will be set up in Wuhu and Bengbu. Preparations are also underway to successfully establish agricultural warehouses throughout the province in a short period of time, with the aim of implementing the unified transportation and sale of rice and wheat in the autumn of this year. In recent years, the province's foreign trade has been declining, and grain prices have been fluctuating, even leading to surpluses in some areas and food shortages in others. The biggest reason is that production and sales have not been regulated, leading to rural bankruptcy, and the province's commercial and financial markets have also been fatally hit. When the agricultural warehouses are completed, the methods of unified transportation and sales and balancing market prices can be started. The construction of warehouses in various places has begun. The Provincial Agricultural Warehouse Management Office has sent personnel to Wuhan to negotiate with the Agricultural Bank of China, and the bank has decided to invest 60% of the total agricultural warehouse, while the remaining 40% will be borne by the Anhui Local Bank. It has also been decided to expand the scope of the warehouses in places with convenient transportation in order to utilize ships and trains and reduce transportation difficulties. The board of directors of the Provincial Local Bank believes that the bank has many economic construction undertakings in the province and that its responsibilities are heavy, so it has decided to establish an Economic Research Society. Professor Wang Shiying of the Cooperative College of the Central Political School has been hired as the director, with a monthly budget of 1,000 yuan. The only task is to investigate and study the economic conditions of the counties throughout the province to serve as the standard for all future facilities. (14th)</p>

<p>Lu Xinzhi, who lives in Wuqiao Alley here, is from a wealthy family. A threatening letter suddenly arrived by post the other day, demanding a loan of 1,000 French currency, to be arranged at Xiaoshantai on the 12th of this month, signed "Wang Daxing." After receiving the letter, Lu was extremely panicked and immediately reported the case to the police for investigation. After investigation, there was no gain. On the evening of the 13th, an unknown woman came to knock on the Lu family's door. The Lu family firmly refused to open it and asked for her name from the upstairs window. The woman claimed to be surnamed Wang. Because the Lu family did not know the woman and there was no reason for her to knock on the door, they suspected that she was related to the threatening letter, so they devised a plan to lure and capture her and sent her to the Public Security Bureau. The woman claimed to be Qin Er, but denied any involvement in sending threatening letters. However, the authorities believed that she was highly suspicious and detained her for investigation.</p>

<p>Farmers in Guanyun County and others believe that the Huaihe River Flood Discharge into the Sea Project Committee has changed the plan of Engineer Guan of the Construction Department and will not dredge the old Shanhuhou River. Instead, it will move the river line to the middle of the Chaozhi and Shanhuhou Rivers, which are less than four li apart, and open a new river, abandoning more than 6,000 mu of grain fields and cutting off the livelihood of hundreds of farmers. As a result, the farmers there were greatly panicked and jointly telegraphed appeals to government offices at all levels, requesting to stop it, and appointed Qiao Xuejie and Li Guangfan as representatives to go to the province to petition. Qiao and others returned to the county from the province yesterday (the 9th). According to reports, there is no case of opening a new river in the province, only a case of still dredging the old river. The farmers, knowing the truth, immediately went to the Guanyun County Government to request County Magistrate Xu to postpone the opening of the new river to maintain the people's lives.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department stated that the fees for dredging rivers, building dams, and irrigating water in Jiangdu were originally collected locally by the township heads in various benefited areas. Now, the aforementioned fees have been ordered by the Department to be paid by the Jiangdu County Government from the county's construction expenses, or from designated funds. However, there are still situations where the districts and townships that carry out dredging rivers, building dams, and irrigating water are collecting these expenses from the villagers, which is really dereliction of duty and profiteering. Yesterday (the 13th), a special order was issued to the county government to strictly investigate and prohibit this, and the county was instructed to publicize the amount and source of all expenses for dredging rivers, building dams, and irrigating water before starting work, in order to prevent malpractices.</p>

<p>In order to meet the demands of merchants, the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Committee decided to abandon the unified control of spring cocoons this year and allow merchants to purchase as much as they wanted, but the government must register and manage them in order to protect the interests of farmers. Since registration began last month, it ended yesterday (the 15th). A total of more than 120 numbers were registered in eight districts, including more than 80 silk factories. Representatives of silk factories from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, such as Chu Ciseng, came to Hangzhou by car from Shanghai on the 15th to petition the provincial government and the sericulture association, requesting an extension of the deadline for registration, the payment of a deposit, and the concurrent purchase of local species of cocoons. The association rejected the request for merchants to jointly purchase cocoons, which was close to monopoly. The deadline and deposit must be handled in accordance with the regulations. The concurrent purchase of local species can be determined according to the situation in each county. According to the person in charge of the sericulture association, the output of fresh cocoons in Zhejiang Province this year reached 240,000 dan. According to the current silk price calculation of cocoon prices, the purchase requires 8 million yuan. After the registration of various silk factories, there are still surplus cocoons, which are allowed to be purchased by cocoon merchants.</p>

<p>Regarding the implementation of the ban on opium and the rejection of drugs, all places are actively carrying out the work, and the results are very significant. It is also reported that this place is being carried out step by step by the Public Security Bureau. The registration procedures for opium addicts are the responsibility of the Opium Suppression Section. For ordinary opium addicts, the steps are to limit the time for quitting. For those who use drugs, strict compulsory rehabilitation methods are used. If traffickers are caught, they will be sent to the Fengyang County Government for strict punishment in accordance with the law. The Anhui Provincial Government recently instructed the Public Security Bureau to strictly carry out inspections. The bureau has issued a general announcement ordering unregistered opium addicts to quickly go to the bureau to register and pay fees according to the regulations, with ordinary fees of five yuan and six cents for the poor, with a deadline of the 20th of this month. Those who do not register will be severely punished if found later. Those who use drugs should quickly go to the drug rehabilitation center for treatment. At 10:00 AM on the 10th, the Public Security Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of transportation agencies to discuss secret inspection methods for opium and drugs in order to be thorough. It is reported that various secret inspection procedures have been agreed upon and will be intensified within the next few days in order to eliminate opium and drugs.</p>

<h3 id="e116">On Financial Policies During Extraordinary Times (Continued) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Shuyu</p>
<p>Dr. Ma's second countermeasure is a limited inflation of the currency, which seems to be a warning to the financial authorities. Because according to his syllogism, the main three kinds of taxes are unreliable, the mortgage of public bonds has lost its nature, and they cannot continue to be issued. With no tax revenue and no way to issue public bonds, the only option is to inflate the currency as much as possible. Whether his judgment is entirely correct need not be fully investigated. However, in my humble opinion, the government will not resort to the excessive issuance of banknotes as a way out of its financial difficulties. The reason for this is very simple. First, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, our country has abandoned the silver standard and adopted a foreign exchange standard. Once banknotes are issued excessively, it would be tantamount to making the national currency valueless, cutting off its foreign exchange relations, and destroying its international credit. Since the right to issue banknotes was unified in the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China, not only has the financial foundation of the country been established, but the financial relationship between the people and the country has also been strengthened, and the people's faith in the nation has grown. Under such circumstances, who would be willing to excessively issue banknotes to destroy their credibility with the people? We ask whether the financial authorities would be so foolish. As for a limited inflation of the currency, it is originally necessary, because the number of existing legal currencies is less than 10 billion yuan, which is still felt to be insufficient. Therefore, a corresponding inflation of the currency is beneficial to both the country and society.</p>
<p>The above is a brief review of Dr. Ma's two countermeasures. Then, what kind of financial policy should be adopted in extraordinary times? In principle, financial policy should be included in the entire economic policy. Financial administration that is not coordinated with economic policy cannot be called a policy at all. It is no different from the receipt and disbursement of money in the accounts of money shops and companies. The ancients said, "If the people are not sufficient, who will the ruler be sufficient with?" and "If the people are rich, the country is rich," which is exactly in line with this principle. The financial managers of ancient China, such as Guan Zhong of Qi, Shang Yang of Qin, Xiao He of Han, and Wang Anshi of Song, all managed state affairs under this principle. Recently, the government has been reforming its financial administration while striving for economic revival, and is especially anxious to develop the southwest and northwest. I believe that as long as we can work hard to complete this kind of economic construction, we can establish a financial policy for extraordinary times. In addition to the general principles, I would also like to list a few scattered opinions for the reference and research of financial authorities and financial experts, and to conclude this article.</p>
<p>(1) Implement economic control policies. The reason why it is not easy for our country to implement economic control at present is due to the constraints of unequal treaties and the limitations of international relations. In extraordinary times, foreign relations are simple, so we can do what we want. As for the scope of control, it is of course multifaceted: Control of production, which is the so-called planned production. Whether state-owned or private, they should all engage in the production of essential industries; Control of consumption, which means that consumption should be moderate and average; Control of trade, which can be divided into two aspects: Internally, the market price should be publicly determined to balance prices in various places; Externally, foreign trade should be managed by the state. All goods that the country does not need and urgently needs can be dumped abroad to enrich the national treasury.</p>
<p>(2) Encourage people to invest in the interior in a planned way. Most of the existing capital in our country is concentrated in Shanghai and several large metropolitan areas along the coast and along the river. Once something happens, not only will the people suffer losses in finance and industry and commerce, but the government's financial resources will also be destroyed. Therefore, this kind of capital should be moved to the metropolitan areas and rural areas of the southwest and northwest provinces in a planned way, either for industrial and commercial operations or for investment in planting and animal husbandry. However, the government should bring together leaders from the financial and industrial and commercial sectors to plan and promote in a planned way. Mere empty talk on paper is of no avail.</p>
<p>(3) Inflate the currency to provide construction capital. To engage in economic construction in extraordinary times, a small amount of capital cannot be effective. On the one hand, the government should encourage people to invest, and at the same time, it needs a large amount of capital to provide funds for state-owned and lending to the people. To raise this fund, the government can directly issue banknotes. It is originally felt that the current amount is insufficient. If the number of legal currencies is increased by a factor of two compared to the current amount and is used exclusively for various production industries, the credit of legal currencies will not be reduced.</p>
<p>(4) Implement state monopoly of salt. Salt is the main element of people's lives, so all countries sell it by state monopoly. Most of our country's salt fields are on the coast. Once the sea is blockaded, the people's salt will be in danger. Therefore, the government should store large quantities of salt in the interior and implement state monopoly to maintain the people's food and enrich the national treasury.</p>
<p>(5) Issue national salvation public bonds and organize national salvation savings. When the country is in extraordinary times, the people have the responsibility and obligation to save the country. During the European War, all countries tried their best to raise domestic public bonds and encouraged the people to donate money to save the country. Taking Germany as an example, the people not only donated money, but even valuable goods and daily hardware utensils were included in the collection. Therefore, in the future, the issuance of national salvation public bonds and the encouragement of people to save money to save the country should be done to the best of our ability.</p>
<p>(6) Borrow foreign debt. In theory, at that time, all countries would have to take care of themselves. Who would have the spare money to lend to us? However, in the future, we will naturally have our own countries. As long as our country's borders are not completely blockaded, even if we cannot borrow cash, it is the same if we can borrow other people's surplus military supplies and machines. I think this path is feasible.</p>
<p>Originally, the country's extraordinary financial policy should be determined and changed according to the environment. This time, when Ma Chuan-shi raised this question, I also recklessly expressed some opinions. (The End)</p>

In addition, there were representatives Zhao Tiezhang from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Geng Jiaji from the Shanghai Municipal Government, Lin Meiyan from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and Chinese Directors and Committee Members Xu Xinliu and Guo Shun, etc.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings After the meeting commenced, Chairman Wang Xiaolai first delivered a speech, followed by Chinese Director Xu Xinliu's report on his participation in politics during the 24th year of the Republic (both reported in yesterday's newspaper). Then, the election began: (A) Election of five directors to the Public Concession Municipal Council, with Pan Xulun and Pei Yunqing designated as vote counters and Feng Meixue and Song Shixiang as ballot readers. (B) Election of six committee members to the Public Concession Municipal Council, with Cao Zhigong and Li Wenjie designated as vote counters and Xie Zhongfu and He Yuliang as ballot readers. (C) Election of one land committee member to the Public Concession Municipal Council, with Fang Jiaobo and Wang Tianbai designated as vote counters and Jin Runxiang and Wang Haifan as ballot readers.</p>
<p>Election Results (A) For the five directors, the total number of ballots was 76. Yu Zhiqing received 74 votes, Xu Xinliu 72 votes, Jiang Yiping 72 votes, Xi Yushu 72 votes, and Guo Shun 42 votes. These five were re-elected as directors. Yuan Ludeng received the most votes among the losing candidates, with 41 votes. (B) For the six committee members, the total number of ballots was 75, with some ballots being voided. Lin Kanghou received 72 votes, Zhu Wenqi 69 votes, Xu Xiaochu 69 votes, Yu Hualong 65 votes, and Chen Jicheng 53 votes. These five were re-elected as committee members. However, Wang Yansong received 39 votes and Wu Yunzhai 34 votes. According to Article 4 of the association's rules for electing representatives to the Municipal Council, "Elected candidates must receive more than half of the votes of those present to be elected as the aforementioned representatives." As there were 81 representatives present yesterday, a majority would be 41 votes. The chairman announced that a run-off election for one committee member was necessary.</p>
<p>Second Run-Off Election Ballots were then redistributed for a run-off election for one committee member. The results showed Wang Yansong with 39 votes and Wu Yunzhai with 33 votes, still insufficient to meet the required number of votes. According to Article 5, "If the number of elected candidates is less than the required number, a run-off election shall be held for twice the number of vacancies, using the candidates with the most votes until the required number is reached." Therefore, ballots were redistributed for a second run-off election. The results showed Wang Yansong with 38 votes and Wu Yunzhai with 33 votes, still insufficient. Xu Jiqing then proposed that they first elect one land committee member to the Public Concession Municipal Council and then discuss the issue of the run-off election for the committee member. This was approved.</p>
<p>Meeting Adjourned In the election results, Jin Zongcheng received 47 votes out of a total of 71 and was re-elected as land committee member. Afterwards, the issue of the run-off election for the committee member was discussed. Xu Jiqing proposed that the association still needed to elect 27 executive committee members and had eight important motions to be discussed, but time was insufficient, so the meeting should be adjourned and continued on the 18th of this month (Saturday) at 1 p.m. at the same location. This was unanimously approved by the assembly.</p>
<p>Eight Motions to be Discussed The association submitted a total of eight motions for discussion at the meeting on the 18th. The original text is as follows: (A) To petition the government and authorize the Municipal Council to promptly negotiate with the countries concerned and agree to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council by four, starting in the 26th year of the Republic, to demonstrate greater cooperation. (B) Regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's telephone rates, to amend the four proposals made by the Chinese directors on the Municipal Council to calculate the basic rates for both business and residential use at a rate of three cents per unit. (C) To urge the Municipal Council to strictly enforce the ratio of 20 to 1 between house tax and land tax in accordance with the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, and that house tax should not be an exception according to the regulations and should be borne in accordance with the methods implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Government. (D) To further urge the Municipal Council to compile all individual rules into a booklet in Chinese and distribute them to taxpayers. (E) To question the Municipal Council as to why it has not implemented the association's proposal to "abolish the band and the vehicle committee." (F) To question the Municipal Council as to why it has not implemented the resolution that, starting from this year, the annual reports, budgets, and final accounts should be compiled in both Chinese and English and submitted to the association for distribution to registered Chinese taxpayers before April 1 each year for review by the General Meeting of Representatives. (G) To revise the term limits for Chinese directors and committee members. (H) Regarding the letter from the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association requesting the association to correct its name, whether to amend the name.</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the Municipal Council to inform them of the list of directors and committee members for this term. "To the Honorable Sirs, We hereby inform you that Yu Zhiqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun have been elected by the Ratepayers' Representative Assembly as directors to your esteemed council for the 25th and 26th years of the Republic. We enclose the contact information for the directors and committee members and request your council to take note." A letter was also sent to the elected directors, informing them of their election: "To the Honorable Sirs, On April 15th, at the first General Meeting of Representatives, Yu Zhiqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Guo Shun were elected as directors of the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council for the 25th and 26th years of the Republic. In addition to notifying the Municipal Council and submitting separate reports, we are writing to inform you for your information."</p>
<p>Executive Committee Meeting Postponed The association originally scheduled the first meeting of the 15th Executive Committee for 3 p.m. on the 16th (today) to elect a chairman and vice-chairman and three standing committee members, as well as to discuss the cases submitted by the first General Meeting of Representatives. As the election of executive committee members has been postponed to the 18th, it has been decided to postpone the meeting to the 19th.</p>
<p>Taking Office Today The new directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council will take office today at 12 noon at the Municipal Council and hold their first directors' meeting.</p>

<p>Feng Bingnan Re-elected</p>
<p>The Land Committee of the Public Concession Municipal Council has two Chinese land committee member seats. One seat is elected by the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the other has traditionally been elected by the Property Owners' Association. Now that the Shanghai Property Owners' Association has been reorganized into the Shanghai Property Owners' Association, it also held a meeting yesterday to recommend Feng Bingnan for the position. The association will send a letter to the Ratepayers' Association today to jointly notify the Public Concession Municipal Council.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Ministry of Finance Entrusts Central Bank to Redeem Old Copper Coins <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Dagong Agency: The Ministry of Finance, recognizing that there are many old copper coins scattered among the people in China, especially in provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, where people collect these coins, acknowledges that their material is indeed made of pure copper. Now that the new subsidiary currency is in circulation, it is a pity that these pure copper coins are discarded among the people as waste. To gradually redeem and deliver them to the mint for melting and recasting into copper subsidiary currency, the Ministry of Finance has entrusted the Central Bank in various places to redeem them. The methods for redeeming the coins are currently being drafted and will be announced and implemented soon.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Public Concession: Annual Meeting of Foreign Taxpayers Held Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Eight Motions Passed, Music Band Retained</p>
<p>The annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Shanghai Public Concession was held at the Paramount Theatre on Jing'an Temple Road yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM and adjourned at 4:45 PM.  In attendance on the stage were Chairman Arnold, all foreign directors, Municipal Council Secretary-General Fessenden, and General Manager Chung Sze.  Chairman Arnold first proposed:</p>
<p>To elect Mr. Bell as Chairman of the meeting, seconded by Mr. Landale, passed. Mr. Bell then took the chair.</p>
<p>Following which, the Chairman proposed to elect Mr. Bisley as Secretary of the meeting, seconded by Mr. Landale, passed.</p>
<p>Next, the Chairman proposed to adopt the rules of procedure, seconded by Mr. Landale, passed.</p>
<p>To elect one Land Committee member, proposed by Mr. Marshall, seconded by Mr. Harris, Mr. Pick was elected as this year's Land Committee member for taxpayers.</p>
<p>To elect four directors of the Public Hospital, proposed by Chairman Arnold, seconded by Mr. Landale, Dr. Brandson, Dr. Dunn, Mr. Carl Hahn, and Mr. Boardman, were elected as this year's directors of the Public Hospital.</p>
<p>The Chairman then requested the Municipal Council Chairman to present the annual report and financial statements for the previous year. Mr. Arnold immediately stood up and delivered a speech, reporting on the income and expenditure accounts of the previous year. The accounts were proposed by Mr. Arnold and seconded by Mr. Landale, passed by the meeting. During his speech, the Chairman mentioned that the head of the Public Works Department, Mr. Hubbard, would resign and return home in June of this year. Mr. Hubbard has served the Municipal Council for more than 30 years and has made significant contributions to the construction of this port. He should be thanked on behalf of the taxpayers and wished a prosperous future. The audience applauded in agreement. Afterwards, someone expressed his opinion on the public rickshaw issue in this port, generally praising the enthusiastic dedication and the recent appropriate and successful handling of the rickshaw owners' strike by the Municipal Council's Rickshaw Affairs Committee, and advocated that the Municipal Council should continue its past policies and actively seek benefits for the general public.</p>
<p>The Chairman then requested the Municipal Council Chairman to present this year's budget. Mr. Arnold immediately stood up and read out a summary of the budget, approving the collection of taxes as proposed, and authorizing the board to raise 12 million yuan for temporary expenses, requesting the approval of the meeting. Mr. Landale immediately seconded. The Chairman then stood up and said that Rev. Boynton has a motion about the retention of the music band. The current year's budget should be amended to authorize the Municipal Council to maintain the existence of the music band from January 1st of this year, with annual expenses not to exceed 200,000 yuan. Rev. Boynton then went on stage to state his reasons for retaining the music band, which were lengthy, mainly: (1) The expenses for maintaining the band are less than 1% of the total budget, which is insignificant compared to other public welfare matters such as parks. (2) The musicians in the band are artists who have devoted their lives to music, and their means of livelihood are very narrow. Cancelling the band will create new unemployment problems, while the existing widespread unemployment problem remains unresolved. (3) The existence of the band is related to the cultural progress of a place. Shanghai has maintained this band for many years, and should not take retrogressive actions now. (4) The use of the band is gradually expanding, and if it can get the help of citizens in the future, its use will be further promoted. The proposal by Mr. Boynton to retain the band and amend the budget was immediately passed by a majority.</p>
<p>Mr. Pick then proposed, in order to improve the housing problem in this port, that the Municipal Council should organize a housing problem investigation committee to investigate the crowded living conditions of the poor people in this port and ways to remedy them. Mr. Pick's original speech was very lengthy, recounting the crowded and dangerous pigeon-cage-style housing in the Chinese alleys, as well as the conversion of residential houses into factories in the neighborhoods, which are unhygienic and easily cause danger. Chairman Arnold replied, saying that the Municipal Council authorities had already started investigating and designing the housing problem for the poor people in this port, but the plan had not yet been fully completed, and the review would take time, so it could not be announced for the time being. Therefore, Mr. Pick's proposal today does not seem to understand the work that the various parts of the Municipal Council have already begun, and the desire to add redundant institutions will hinder the original work, so this motion is actually useless. Mr. Pick then stood up and replied that the investigation of the housing problem is urgent and cannot be delayed any longer. However, since the Chairman has stated that various parts of the Municipal Council have already started this work, he is willing to amend the original proposal to request the Municipal Council to instruct its relevant parts to immediately investigate and report. After the original motion by Mr. Pick was amended, it was seconded by the original seconder, Mr. Lecey, and unanimously passed by the meeting. The Chairman then announced the adjournment of the meeting, which was already at 4:45 PM. Excerpts from the Chairman's speech are attached below.</p>
<p>The Chairman's speech at the foreign annual meeting involved a total of ten items: (1) Political situation, (2) Financial situation, (3) Road construction outside the concession, (4) Traffic problems, (5) Rickshaw problems, (6) Telephone problems, (7) Education, (8) Municipal Council Band, (9) Income and expenditure report, (10) 1936 budget. Regarding the first four items, the Chairman's words were very brief. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Political Situation: The Chairman said that except for two unfortunate incidents that occurred this year, the overall political situation can be said to have been uneventful. Fortunately, these two incidents did not cause a great disturbance, which is the best of a bad situation. One was the murder of Japanese sailors in Hongkou. Initially, Japanese residents were quite tense about the way the concession police authorities handled the matter. Fortunately, both sides were able to be patient and resolve the misunderstanding, and international relations were not broken. The other incident was the demonstrations held by Chinese students in this port in December last year and January this year. They were stimulated by the North China issue, so their anti-Japanese sentiment was quite obvious and tense. Moreover, whenever mass actions occur, there are inevitably violent elements and agitators mixed in, engaged in the brewing of misconduct. Of course, this time was no exception. Fortunately, the police handled it properly, so although there were conflicts with the crowds in the concession and those outside the concession who wanted to invade the concession, they were all controlled and dispersed, and no bloodshed occurred. This has to be attributed to the progress of police methods.</p>
<p>Financial Situation: Briefly speaking, the financial situation of this port can be said to be suffering from the shock of the global recession, and there is still no hope of recovery. Although there are no accurate and unshakeable statistics on the unemployment problem and the people who have lost their livelihoods, judging from the general trend, the unemployment situation today is probably worse than before. For example, during the abolished Lunar New Year, two large yarn factories are still in the process of going bankrupt, and the number of unemployed workers has suddenly increased by more than 5,000. In addition, Chinese yarn factories are also implementing production cuts, and other small factories are also contracting one by one. Looking ahead, there is really no hope of improvement for the time being.</p>
<p>Road Construction Outside the Concession: Regarding this important issue, the Chairman only said that in the second half of last year, the negotiations had made considerable progress, and the problem seemed to be about to be resolved. Unfortunately, the Japanese authorities in this port insisted that a certain fee currently paid by Japanese residents in the northern district to the Chinese Telephone Bureau must be abolished before the agreement is signed. This matter was immediately submitted by the Chinese side to the central government for a decision. The Nanjing government, which is overwhelmed with the country's many problems, may not have time to take care of it for the time being, and this problem had to be temporarily shelved.</p>
<p>Traffic Problems: According to the Chairman, the Commissioner of Police of the Municipal Council spent a long time in London during his vacation last year, observing and studying the traffic management methods there. He also transferred a key member of the Police Force to stay in New Scotland Yard (i.e., the London Central Police Station) to learn about traffic management matters. According to the Commissioner of Police's report after returning to Shanghai, the traffic difficulties experienced by major cities in England are far greater than those in Shanghai. This statement is quite credible, because independent observers who have returned to Shanghai from Europe and the United States have said the same thing. Among the traffic problems in Shanghai, one of the most difficult parts is the rickshaw problem. The large number of rickshaws is a major cause of traffic congestion here. Therefore, in 1926, the Municipal Council's committee proposed to gradually reduce the number of rickshaws, with the aim of reducing them from 10,000 to 5,000 in ten years. However, pedestrians or those who ride rickshaws feel pain and resentment toward the arrogant attitude of those who ride cars. There will be a detailed discussion on the rickshaw problem later, so I will not elaborate on it here.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Problem: Regarding the rickshaw problem, the Chairman said that in early April this year, the rickshaw owners planned to use a strike to resist rent reductions, but it soon failed. The result has made the general public more aware of this complex and difficult rickshaw problem, and most of the misunderstandings on which past newspaper commentaries were based have now been eliminated. Moreover, the general public now believes that the Municipal Council's active attention to this rickshaw problem began with Mr. Massey's report, which is not entirely true. The beginning and end of the bureau's handling of this problem are roughly stated as follows: As early as 1917, the Public Concession Municipal Council had taken measures to improve the rickshaw situation and stipulate the total number of rickshaws to be 8,000. However, this restriction soon led to the monopoly of some strong rickshaw owners, who disregarded everything and only sought profit, and did not care about the interests of the public and rickshaw pullers. By 1922, the contracting problem had become the subject of much debate. In October of that year, the Board of Directors instructed the Commissioner of Police to investigate the possibility of public management of rickshaws. In January 1923, the Commissioner of Police issued a detailed report. According to the situation obtained at that time, there was no major difference from what Mr. Massey reported later. The only difference was that after the investigation was announced at that time, the public did not show deep sympathy for the lives of rickshaw pullers. After the Board of Directors reviewed this matter, they all said that public management of rickshaws was not feasible, and it was difficult to register rickshaw pullers. These were the views at that time. Unexpectedly, ten years later, the results of the investigation by the Massey Committee were the opposite of the above. Now the Municipal Council has established a Rickshaw Affairs Committee to implement all the recommendations in the Massey report, and it has been more than two years. The most important measure is the registration and licensing of public rickshaw pullers, because without this, there can be no proper management of rickshaw affairs. Last year, when I was in charge of the annual meeting, I also discussed this matter. Since then, by July, a total of more than 37,000 public rickshaw pullers had been registered and licensed, and more than 15,000 private rickshaw pullers had also been registered. Outsiders do not know the difficulties and hardships of the bureau in handling this problem. However, what the authorities considered impossible in fact ten years ago has now been achieved, which is also a satisfactory move. The continued issuance of new licenses is in progress. After this matter is completed, the true situation of the rickshaw industry and the appropriate number of rickshaw pullers will not be difficult to obtain statistics. In addition, as all taxpayers know, since April of this year, the rickshaw rent has been reduced by another 8%. It is not easy to calculate to what extent the rent should be reduced, and the numbers on which it is based may still need to be considered. However, reducing the rent is to reduce the burden on the rickshaw pullers, while at the same time the rickshaw owners will not suffer too much. I say this not to say that the rickshaw problem has come to an end. However, from the perspective of the bureau, the failure of the rickshaw owners' strike has made considerable progress, but looking ahead, there are still many obstacles. "Furthermore, the Rickshaw Committee has the right to make suggestions at any time regarding the number of rickshaws. The current large number of rickshaws on the market is indeed a major problem for traffic in this port. There are many things that the Board of Directors will handle in due course. However, if the number of vehicles is reduced to the point where supply cannot meet demand, it will be enough to create a monopoly for rickshaw owners and use licenses to make profits. Therefore, it is necessary to start with rent reduction, because rent reduction, on the one hand, takes care of the reasonable profits of rickshaw merchants according to economic principles, and on the other hand, it can prevent monopolies and the sale of licenses. Therefore, before this matter is handled, the gradual reduction in the number of vehicles cannot be expected to be too hasty. The Chairman continued, "Now that the licensing of rickshaw pullers has been implemented, the rickshaw rent has been reduced twice, the rickshaw samples are gradually being improved, and the mutual aid association is also developing day by day. Therefore, the handling of this problem can be said to have achieved considerable results. However, the reorganization of the Rickshaw Committee to save expenses is not yet ripe, but the fact that this matter should be assigned to the normal administrative organization in the future is indeed an issue that should be considered in the future."</p>
<p>Continued on page 11</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>It is not surprising that the rickshaw owners resisted, because human psychology is the same everywhere in the world. Even in other countries, those who can profit from a monopoly will do their best to oppose the authorities' interference and management. From past experience, under such circumstances, it is extremely difficult to obtain fixed and unshakeable statistics to determine the interest rate that rickshaw owners should receive. However, if the rent reduction is based on untrue and incomplete numbers, it will only make matters worse, and the sanctions imposed on rickshaw owners should be considered to see if they are enough to cause their retaliatory actions against rickshaw pullers, such as strikes. Therefore, it is reasonable to proceed slowly rather than hastily when handling this matter.</p>
<p>Telephone Problem: Regarding the telephone problem, the Chairman first stated the beginning and end of this matter, such as the telephone company's request for price increases and the adoption of a metered charging system, the motions of last year's taxpayers' meeting, the negotiations between the Municipal Council and the company, and the investigation report of the expert committee, which have all been disclosed in detail in Chinese and foreign newspapers, and there is no need to repeat them. Regarding the effect after the implementation of the new regulations on March 1st of this year, the Chairman had the following report: "It is not yet enough time to fully determine the effect of the new metered charging system. However, judging from the recent situation, the number of calls has been greatly reduced, probably by 45%. The previously estimated reduction of 37.51% has now been greatly exceeded." Furthermore, the telephone company's subscribers greatly decreased last year due to the impact of the recession. However, since the implementation of the new system on March 1st of this year, there has been a large increase in subscribers. This is due to the reduction in the basic cost of business and residential telephones. In March alone, the net increase in subscribers reached as many as 800, which is an unprecedented phenomenon since the company was established. According to the company authorities, the telephone charges paid by current telephone subscribers are estimated to be half as low as before.</p>
<p>Education Problem: Regarding the public concession education facilities, the Chairman said that for several years, due to the impact of the economy on this port, the financial situation has not been expected to recover for a while, and the education development program set in 1931 had to be temporarily suspended. However, last year, the subsidy for Japanese schools in this port increased by 10,000 yuan, and the subsidy for Chinese private schools increased by 20,000 yuan. This year, due to the efforts of the Chinese and Japanese education circles, the subsidy for Japanese schools increased by 11,000 yuan, and the subsidy for Chinese schools increased by 19,000 yuan. By this point, the concession's education expenses will reach the maximum amount of 2% of the municipal general tax and land price tax. Unless the financial situation improves and the bureau's revenue increases significantly, there is no hope of seeing progress in the education construction program for the time being.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Band: The Chairman said that in June last year, the Board of Directors ordered the Band Committee to investigate whether the band could be reorganized to save expenses, and whether a band equal to the current system should be retained. After considering this matter, the committee reported that the band should be reorganized, and that even within the existing scope, expenses could be saved by 78,500 yuan per year, and the total annual expenses of the band would not exceed 200,000 yuan. In view of the fact that the fate of the band is in the hands of the annual taxpayers' meeting, the Board of Directors, as a matter of routine, leaves the decision on the retention, abolition, or reorganization of the band to the free disposal of the taxpayers. However, in order to facilitate the implementation of the annual meeting's resolution, all the musicians were notified in advance that the employment contract would expire on May 31st of this year. The band's expenses in this year's budget are only prepared for the first five months. Therefore, if the taxpayers want to retain or reorganize the band, the budget must be amended. Regarding this matter, a motion has been submitted today, awaiting the meeting's decision.</p>
<p>Last Year's Income and Expenditure Report: Regarding the Municipal Council's income and expenditure accounts for last year, they have been published separately in newspapers. The expenses of various departments last year were reduced by a total of 1.6 million yuan compared to the budget. Among them, the police department saved 600,000 yuan, and the public works department also saved 500,000 yuan. However, the hiring of telephone experts cost 95,000 yuan of public funds, which is also a loss for the bureau. On the income side, there was also a shortage of 1.2 million yuan last year. As for temporary income and expenditure, efforts were made to tighten it last year, so all construction projects had to be temporarily suspended, and debt repayments had to be postponed. Statistically, the income and expenditure offset each other, and the amount of the shortfall was not much different from the previous year. The Chairman further stated here that the head of the Public Works Department, Mr. Hubbard, will voluntarily resign in June of this year. Mr. Hubbard joined the Municipal Council in 1902 and was promoted to head of the Public Works Department in 1922, having been in office for more than 30 years. The Chairman immediately wished Mr. Hubbard infinite happiness in his future after retirement.</p>
<p>This Year's Budget: According to the Chairman's report, the outline of this year's budget is that this year's income, including the surplus of 269,700 yuan from last year, totals 24,781,000 yuan, which is about 1 million yuan less than last year. The reason for this shortfall is nothing more than the recession, which has led to an increasing number of empty houses and lower rents, and the general tax collected by the bureau has been greatly affected. For example, license fees and public utility income have also been sharply reduced for the same reason. In addition, this year's education expenses total 2,367,500 yuan, an increase of 97,000 yuan compared to last year, reaching 9.5% of the Municipal Council's total income. As for recurring expenses, excluding education expenses, 24,397,000 yuan is needed, a decrease of 410,000 yuan compared to the same number last year. The above numbers are all due to the extremely tight contraction policy. For example, the number of police personnel has now been reduced to the limit that cannot be reduced any further. If it is tightened further in the future, it will cause a certain kind of danger. In addition, the affairs of other departments have also been gradually reduced or suspended. The Chairman further said that the cost of living in Shanghai has been greatly affected by exchange rates. What we hope is that the foreign exchange balance maintained by the Chinese government will promote economic recovery. Although this is also a matter of imagination, the Municipal Council's budget has indeed been affected by it in advance, so that the effect of contraction on the one hand has been eroded by the low exchange rate for the most part. The difference between the above recurring income and expenditure is more than 1.98 million yuan. In view of the current economic situation, it is necessary to use 2 million yuan of the reserve fund. The amount that has been used from this reserve fund in the past five years has reached 9 million yuan. However, this fund is not inexhaustible and inexhaustible. Therefore, in the near future, the 16% general tax previously collected may have to be restored. Furthermore, the total amount required under the temporary income and expenditure item reaches 13,265,000 yuan, including last year's deficit of 5,592,000 yuan. In addition, temporary education expenses require another 64,700 yuan. All major constructions that can be suspended have been temporarily suspended. However, work that has already started cannot be interrupted. Other things, such as purchasing land to widen roads, must be carried out, which will cost a total of 3,219,500 yuan. In addition, there are appropriations for repayments and pensions, totaling 3,753,500 yuan. As for the income side, the income from land sales is extremely uncertain. Therefore, in order to balance income and expenditure, it is really necessary to request the meeting to authorize the issuance of public bonds or to raise another 12 million yuan through other methods.</p>

<p>Reporting Matters: After formalities, Chairman Du Yuesheng first reported on: (A) Membership Recruitment: The first phase of recruitment resulted in a total of 1,710 new members. (B) Negotiations with the French Concession Authorities: More than ten companies, including the Xinyu Tai Western tobacco business, jointly submitted a request stating that they only sell tobacco and do not sell other goods. The French Municipal Council has been collecting tobacco taxes on a monthly basis without any other tobacco-related fees. Unexpectedly, the Public Works Bureau intends to levy a classified business sanitation tax on businesses this year. They specifically requested that the French authorities be asked to abolish this exorbitant tax. The association sent a letter and dispatched personnel to negotiate. Later, a reply was received from Blandin, Acting Director of the French Municipal Council, agreeing to cancel the classified business sanitation tax for the ten companies. A reply was sent to the industry for their information. A letter from a branch of the Citizens’ Association of the Special District stated that since the reconstruction of roads in the area of Rue Cardinal Mercier (now Ruijin Yi Road) and Route Tenant de la Tour (now Fuxing Zhong Road), the sidewalks on both sides have been delayed in construction, requesting a letter to the French authorities to negotiate. The association had previously raised this matter with the French Municipal Council, which replied that the bureau would immediately invite contractors to bid for repairs. As the association's second request has been received, another letter was sent to the Municipal Council requesting prompt action. On March 24, a reply was received from the bureau stating that a contractor had been hired and work had begun. A letter from the Fenjiu Industry Association stated that the Municipal Council has repeatedly levied donation solicitations on the industry within the concession, and imposed a monthly tax of two yuan and eight jiao on small single-room hotels, requesting negotiation. After investigation, it was found to be true. A letter was sent to the French Municipal Council to balance the tax rate for the industry and to clearly mark the grading basis. A letter from the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association in Shanghai stated that a fellow villager, Ying Cai Fang, was injured to death by Zhou Bu Guang, requesting that the French authorities be instructed to order the defendant to appear for questioning. The association forwarded the request to the French General Inspectorate, instructing Zhou Bu Guang to obey the summons. Letters from the Restaurant Industry Association and the Public Gathering Association stated that the concession police were preventing the collection of aviation national salvation donations, requesting assistance in negotiation. The association dispatched personnel to negotiate. As a result, the consent of the French authorities was obtained, allowing the collection.</p>
<p>A letter from Chinese Committee member Jin Liren stated that Chinese detective Chen Chengkun of the Public Concession illegally detained clerk Huang Jiande, requesting that the French authorities be strongly urged to uphold justice to reassure the good and punish the lawless. The association, based on Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period of the Republic of China, which stipulates that people shall not be intruded upon, searched, or sealed off without legal basis, sent a letter to the French Municipal Council ordering the General Inspectorate to transfer Chen Chengkun to the court for investigation. The association also made serious representations to the Public Concession authorities, stating that similar incidents should not occur again. A letter from member Rixin Sheng stated that a barber employed by the shop was detained for no reason, requesting negotiation. The association dispatched personnel to negotiate with the relevant police station. The police admitted the mistake on the spot, and the matter was settled.</p>
<p>Matters Resolved: A proposal to organize a Real Estate Research Committee was passed in principle and referred to the Standing Committee for handling. A proposal regarding whether the association should sign and comment on the French Concession Municipal Council's proposals before the meeting was passed. A letter will be sent to the Chinese Committee members and Chinese directors requesting that proposals be submitted to the association for signature before the meeting in the future. A resolution of the general meeting, in addition to those within the scope of the association's authority that have already been implemented, cases for which a request was sent to the Municipal Council for implementation but have not received a reply should have the previous proposal reiterated, requesting that it be adopted and handled. It was resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Council for consultation. A proposal on how to increase revenue and reduce expenditure for the association's expenses exceeding the budget was resolved to be referred to the Standing Committee for handling. A proposal regarding the responsibility for repairing the electric light connection line was referred to the Standing Committee for review and handling. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Citywide Cleanliness Campaign Began Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>New Life Movement Instructor Wu Tiecheng Led the Departure</p>
<p>The Campaign Will Be Promoted in the Nanshi Area Again on the 15th and 16th</p>
<p>The Cleanliness Campaign Propaganda Week organized by the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association began on the 15th. At 9:00 AM, led by Wu Tiecheng, Instructor of the New Life Movement in the city, the cleanup began at the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower in the Nanshi area. All members of the Nanshi Youth Service Corps, Boy Scouts, sanitation workers, etc., were mobilized to carry out cleaning, wall cleaning, and household sanitation inspections, etc. The Security Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Security Committee also sent police to assist in the campaign. The cleanliness campaign continued in the Nanshi area on the 16th, and then, according to the schedule, the cleanliness campaign will be promoted in other areas. The situation on the first day is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Solemn Ceremony: The Propaganda Ceremony for the Cleanliness Campaign Propaganda Week was extremely simple and solemn. A white bamboo cloth banner was hung on the New Life Movement electric light slogan frame in front of the Chen Ying Shi Tower, which read "Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association Cleanliness Campaign Propaganda Week," etc. All participants stood on the triangular ground in front of the Chen Ying Shi Memorial Tower. The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent police to maintain order and traffic on the scene, as this is the most lively place in Nanshi, to prevent pedestrians from standing in the streets and obstructing traffic.</p>
<p>Participants: Participants in the opening ceremony included Instructor Wu Tiecheng, Chen Cong, leader of the First Team of the New Life Movement General Association Inspection Group, inspectors Lu Zaiwen and Wu Kecheng, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Li Tingan, Director of the Health Bureau, Yun Honghua, Director of the Shanghai South Health Office, Lu Jingshi and Jiang Hao, members of the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Jiyong, President of Guanghua University, Yang Hu, Commander of the Garrison Headquarters, Wang Jiyi of the Security General Team, Li Jianbai of the China Seamen's Union, Zhu Jiaji and Hu Tianru of the New Life Movement Promotion Association of this city, Bao Henian, Director of the First Branch, Wang Deyan, Director of the Second Branch, Feng Guangjia, Director of the Third Branch, Wu Renqi, Director of the Eighth Branch, Chen Zhongfu, Director of the Eleventh Branch, Luo Lie of the Boy Scout Council, and over a hundred people, including sanitation workers and police.</p>
<p>Formed into Teams: At 9:00 AM, the participants formed teams on the triangle in front of the Chen Ying Shi Tower. Instructor Wu Tiecheng, Chen Cong, leader of the First Team of the General Association Inspection Group, and Pan Gongzhan, Li Tingan, and Zhang Shouyong, directors of the Municipal New Life Movement Association, stood in the first row. The directors of the districts, Bao Henian, etc., stood in the second row. Representatives of various organizations stood in the third row. Sanitation workers and police stood in the fourth row. Each held a broom and advanced slowly north along Minguo Road to Fangbang Bridge, then turned back to the Chen Ying Shi Tower, sweeping the ground along the way.</p>
<p>Full Mobilization: After the opening ceremony, the directors of the Shanghai South District informed all participants, such as the head of the service corps, Boy Scouts, police, and sanitation workers, about 200 people in total, to mobilize to clean roads and walls in various places and inspect household sanitation. All participants wore badges and served conscientiously. However, because the Nanshi area is relatively large, the work was not completed in one day and continued on the 16th.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Chamber of Commerce Requests Cancellation of the Re-Levy of Towboat Tax <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a report to the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan, stating that the Inland River Steamship Industry Association believes that the city's levy of a tax on towed barges and cargo ships is contrary to the law, and listed various points, requesting their judgment and order to cancel the tax. This month, the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Industry...</p>
<p>The Association sent a letter stating that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's illegal re-levy of the towboat cargo ship tax case was brought up for discussion at the sixth general meeting of your association on June 23, 1935. The conference passed a resolution and submitted it to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Communications for approval. On July 9, a letter was received from your association stating that the Executive Yuan issued approval No. 285 on July 9, (omitted above) regarding the Shanghai city's levy of ship tax case. Previously, the city's chamber of commerce submitted a request to the council to legally suspend the levy. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications were ordered to jointly investigate and report with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Because ship taxes are legitimate local taxes, the names and methods of collection in various provinces and cities...</p>
<p>are mostly inconsistent. The Ministry of Finance is currently reorganizing. The Shanghai city ship tax, on the one hand, is temporarily allowed to be levied, and on the other hand, the ship tax regulations are to be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review in accordance with the National Government's order (omitted above), etc. The Executive Yuan has instructed that the matter be temporarily handled in accordance with the report. The association believes that the reasons stated in the joint investigation report by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Communications, and the Shanghai Municipal Government are somewhat forced. Furthermore, the levy of ship tax is only referred to as a temporary levy, and its legislative foundation is incomplete. Moreover, the investigation committee avoided mentioning the point that towboats with licenses from the Ministry of Communications and ship taxes should not be levied as cargo ship taxes according to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's rules for levying ship taxes, which is obviously...</p>
<p>overly biased to conceal the fact that the re-levy is illegal. However, the association is deeply concerned about this case and believes that if this kind of illegal and redundant tax is not abolished according to the law, not only will the difficulties of shipping merchants not be reduced, but also the rights granted to the people by democratic countries will be deprived. Therefore, a special small committee was appointed, and opinions were sought from municipal, legal, and economic experts to conduct detailed research. The legal and economic foundations are complete, and the total amount of cargo ship taxes paid by towboats in the city, as well as the percentage of the city's municipal revenue that it accounts for, and whether it affects the city's revenue, were investigated. After months of detailed investigation and repeated discussion, it was deeply felt that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's re-levy of towboats using cargo ship tax rules is not only...</p>
<p>harmful to merchants and oppressive to the people, and involves excessive complexity, but also violates the law and has no impact on municipal revenue. The reasons are presented to your association as follows: The re-levy of ship tax violates the law. In modern countries, the standards for levying taxes are all divided and incorporated into the constitution, so as to define the government's responsibility and clarify the people's obligations. Article 62 of the Law of the Tutelage Period in our country also stipulates that for various local governments...</p>
<p>which hinder the source of central revenue...</p>
<p>complex...</p>
<p>hindering transportation and other harmful taxes, the central government shall restrict them by law. Now that towboats have paid measurement and inspection fees to the local navigation administration bureau in terms of ship administration, registration fees to the Ministry of Communications in terms of navigation administration, and ship taxes to the local customs on a regular basis in terms of national revenue tariffs, they have fulfilled their legal obligations to the central government's administrative taxes and various revenues. The Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's levy of cargo ship tax has indeed hindered the source of central revenue, hindered transportation, and constituted double taxation. According to the provisions of the above articles of the law, it should be abolished to show the great credibility of the law and maintain the country's fiscal policy. This is the first reason. According to Article 2 of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's rules for levying ship taxes (amended and promulgated on November 11, 1933, by order No. 3655 of the Municipal Government), all kinds of ships traveling in the city's rivers shall pay ship taxes to the ship offices on a daily basis according to the tax rate after being inspected and issued a cargo ship license by the Public Works Bureau. According to Article 1 of the Shanghai Special City's Provisional Penalties for Suppressing Cargo Ships (promulgated by the Municipal Government in March 1930), the term cargo ship in these penalties refers to various ships operating on the waters of Shanghai Special City to transport goods, but excluding the following ships...</p>
<p>rowing boats...</p>
<p>Ningbo sampans...</p>
<p>steamships...</p>
<p>mud barges...</p>
<p>outbound sailing ships...</p>
<p>sand fishing boats...</p>
<p>Wudafu boats...</p>
<p>fishing boats...</p>
<p>other ships that do not carry goods. The ship tax levied by the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau is indeed a cargo ship tax. Among the penalties, steamships, outbound sailing ships, sand fishing boats, and various ships are ships that must be measured and inspected by the navigation administration bureau, registered and licensed by the Ministry of Communications, and pay ship taxes to the customs on a regular basis before they can sail. Now that towboats are in the same situation as steamships and outbound sailing ships, they should be treated equally. The promulgation of the Towboat Management Regulations should not be used as a basis for...</p>
<p>illegal re-levy. Article 8 of the Municipal Organization Law restricts municipal affairs, stipulating that the municipality shall handle the following matters within the scope of not conflicting with the laws and regulations of the central and higher-level agencies. Article 9 of Chapter 3 on Municipal Finance also stipulates that the following items are municipal revenue...</p>
<p>land tax...</p>
<p>house tax...</p>
<p>business tax...</p>
<p>license fees...</p>
<p>advertising tax...</p>
<p>public property income...</p>
<p>publicly operated income...</p>
<p>other taxes and levies specially authorized by law and regulations. Now that towboats are managed by the central government's Ministry of Communications in accordance with the Towboat Management Regulations promulgated on June 5, 1933, and ship taxes are levied by the customs directly under the Ministry of Finance on a regular basis, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau's levy of taxes on them at cargo ship tax rates not only violates the law but also exceeds the scope of the municipal duties prescribed by the Municipal Organization Law. Therefore, according to the provisions of the Municipal Organization Law, it should be abolished to comply with the central and local division of powers. This is the second reason. According to Item 7 of the Second Article of the Standards for Dividing National Revenue and Local Standards passed by the National Financial Conference in July 1928 and promulgated by the National Government on November 20, although ship taxes are classified as local government revenue, Article 4 of the Standards stipulates that if the nature of local revenue overlaps with national revenue, the Ministry of Finance may prohibit its levy. Therefore, although ship taxes are legitimate local government taxes, if their nature overlaps with national revenue, they should also be...</p>
<p>prohibited. Now that the fact that one ship is taxed multiple times conflicts with the law, it should be prohibited in accordance with the regulations to maintain the government's policy of caring for the people. This is the third reason. According to Item 2 of the resolution of the meeting to review the ship tax in Hebei Province on December 28, 1933, by the four ministries of industry, politics, internal affairs, and transportation, the Hebei Provincial Government should exempt the following types of ships from ship tax...</p>
<p>those with nationality certificates from the Ministry of Communications (omitted below). Now that towboats have licenses from the Ministry of Communications, they should be exempted from re-levy, which is the same as an example. Hebei Province and Shanghai City are both Chinese administrative regions, and the implementation of policies should not be different. Furthermore, according to reports, the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee has explicitly ordered the abolition of ship taxes in Hebei Province to alleviate the difficulties of shipping merchants. Therefore, the cancellation of the cargo ship tax on towboats in Shanghai City is a possible matter. This is the fourth reason. In summary, the association believes that before the Ministry of Communications promulgated the Towboat Management Regulations, the Shanghai Municipal Government's levy of ship tax was not suspected of conflicting with the law, which was not a problem. Now that the regulations have been promulgated and implemented, it is a violation of the law and the Municipal Organization Law to levy ship tax on ships with towboat licenses at cargo ship tax rates, and it also violates the government's repeated resolutions to abolish illegal taxes and strictly prohibit the re-levy of any taxes. Since it is an illegal re-levy, shipping merchants should not bear it...</p>
<p>and has no impact on municipal revenue. The above are all in terms of the violation of the law by the re-levy of cargo ship tax on towboats. If the ship tax is a major source of revenue for local governments and its suspension will inevitably affect municipal affairs, let's look at the Shanghai Municipal Finance Statistics Theory. The annual revenue from ship tax was 140,429.20 yuan in 1928, accounting for 2.9% of the total revenue, 210,985.63 yuan in 1929, accounting for 3.6% of the total revenue, and 349,283.79 yuan in 1930, accounting for 4.8% of the total revenue. According to the latest statistics, the towboats of our association members and colleagues totaled 136, and the total amount of cargo ship tax paid to the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau for the whole year was 6,597.30 yuan, accounting for only 1.9% of the ship tax revenue in 1930...</p>
<p>the small amount...</p>
<p>can be imagined. Once abolished, it will not cause significant difficulties to municipal revenue. However, the nature of local cargo ships is different from that of towboats. They have not obtained licenses from the Ministry of Communications, and they do not need to pay ship taxes to the customs. Therefore, they cannot request exemption from ship tax by analogy. Therefore, the levy of ship tax in the city will not be affected in the slightest. What is difficult is whether the municipal authorities have the determination to abide by the law and implement the decree. Since the promulgation and implementation of the Towboat Management Regulations in 1933, members of the association have been burdened with extra-legal taxes for four years, and the economic losses have exceeded millions. Furthermore, the inland river shipping industry has been declining day by day due to the impact of road traffic in various places. If the government is unable to maintain the shipping industry, it should strictly prohibit the illegal levy of taxes on shipping merchants. Otherwise, not only will the shipping merchants who are on the verge of collapse be forced to suspend business, but also the legal decrees will be tantamount to a mere formality. It is of great importance to the national system and the difficulties of the people's livelihood. At a time when foreign aggression is urgent and national disasters are serious, alleviating the people and honest administration are urgent. The association is deeply concerned...</p>
<p>and can no longer remain silent. Therefore, the reasons are detailed and a report from the committee requesting the cancellation of the towboat tax is attached. Please review it and forward it to the Central Political Council and the Executive Yuan to continue to strive for...</p>
<p>the purpose of cancellation, so as to maintain the inland river shipping industry, etc. According to this, the association's statement that the levy of towboat tax is inappropriate is based purely on legal precedents and facts, which is very appropriate. In short, towboats now pay measurement fees to the navigation administration bureau, registration fees to the Ministry of Communications, and ship taxes to the customs. There should be no re-levy of redundant taxes, which is an indisputable principle. The words "temporarily allowed to be levied" in the Executive Yuan's approval No. 285 of July 9, 1935, also clearly indicate that this tax is illegal, but only a temporary accommodation to the facts. It is reasonable to present the situation and request that the council (yuan) review it and order its cancellation in accordance with the law, which is for the public good.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Conflict Between Special District Rickshaw Pullers and Detectives: Court Opens Trial Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Registration Temporarily Suspended Awaiting Resolution; Calm Prevails Yesterday</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works was handling the registration of rickshaw pullers. The day before yesterday, because there were too many unemployed rickshaw pullers, a crowd requested registration, leading to a dispute. Several people were arrested at the time and were handed over to the court for trial yesterday. Rickshaw owners, fearing that the matter would escalate, specially advised the rickshaw pullers to wait patiently for a resolution. Because the matter had not yet been resolved, the Bureau of Public Works temporarily suspended registration. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Rickshaw Owners' Guild Advice: The Special District Rickshaw Guild, fearing that the matter would escalate, issued a notice advising all rickshaw pullers, saying, "Fellow unemployed rickshaw pullers: We read in the newspaper that more than 20,000 of you, due to being restricted by the rickshaw committee in your request for registration, caused a conflict and bloodshed. Our guild feels deeply sorry about this. Rickshaw owners and rickshaw pullers are as close as lips and teeth, and our relationship is extremely important. Our guild deeply sympathizes with your unemployment due to not being registered. We have repeatedly requested the Bureau of Public Works to continue registration on your behalf, and we were pleased to be invited and agreed to. Unexpectedly, this time a dispute arose again due to the restrictions of the rickshaw committee, which was completely unforeseen. However, the rickshaw owners deeply sympathize with your hardship in making a living. Recently, we were fortunate to have Mr. Yu Qiaqing and Mr. Xu Xinliu, the Chinese directors of the Bureau of Public Works, mediate out of consideration for the livelihood of the poor, and their enthusiasm is admirable. However, during the mediation of the Chinese directors, you must wait patiently for the Bureau of Public Works to make a fair decision. Please do not act rashly, lest it cause inconvenience. These are sincere and earnest words, and we hope you will not regard them as empty talk."</p>
<p>Rickshaw Pullers Await Resolution: The rickshaw pullers originally planned to petition various agencies yesterday to request the cancellation of the quota limit. Due to the persuasion of the rickshaw owners, and the Bureau of Public Works Rickshaw Committee having expressed, during negotiations with the rickshaw owners the day before yesterday, that registration would be temporarily suspended for consideration, and the Chinese directors being willing to mediate, they all waited patiently for a resolution. The city was very calm yesterday. The rickshaw pullers decided to wait until after the Bureau of Public Works' first board meeting on the 16th. If there is no appropriate solution, they will petition all parties again, it is said.</p>
<p>Court Opens Trial Yesterday: After the conflict between rickshaw pullers and detectives the afternoon before yesterday, 15 people who were arrested for forcibly snatching armbands and 11 people who threw stones and destroyed public buses, trolley cars, and glass windows were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, the Xinzha Police Station sent the 11 people who destroyed glass windows to the Special Court No. 1, Criminal Division No. 8, to be prosecuted for obstructing official duties under Articles 135 and 132 of the Criminal Law. Most of the 11 people are from Jiangbei, including Luan Fusheng, Mei Hongzhong, Zhou Bu, Yang Shengtian, Yao Agou, Zhang Kunhai, Zhao Yuetai, Zhou Shudong, Xu Jinfu, Sun Deyao, and Zi Jinhua. Except for defendants 4, 6, and 7, the others are all rickshaw pullers, and the heads of defendants 5, 6, and 11 were injured and bandaged. Judge Tan Xinzhen took the stand for interrogation. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that in recent days, the Bureau of Public Works was handling the procedures for rickshaw pullers to exchange for new licenses. Therefore, at 7:30 yesterday morning, many rickshaw pullers and owners gathered at Mackinnon Road and Shunde Road. The owners requested 15,000 registration certificates, but the Bureau of Public Works limited the issuance to 5,000, resulting in a stalemate and a commotion. Later, the number of rickshaw pullers gathered became increasingly large, and by about 12 o'clock, there were more than 10,000 people gathered. At that time, Detective Crawford went to suppress them, but they mistakenly identified him as the director of the Rickshaw Committee and ganged up to make trouble for him. One person punched him, and the others assisted him. Seeing that there were too many rickshaw pullers, the police called the police station and the reserve team for assistance. A public bus No. 15026 passed by, and they smashed the bus windows and threw lime at passing vehicles, resulting in the destruction of doors and windows of five public buses, causing a loss of 360 yuan, and seven trolley cars, causing a loss of 525 yuan. At this time, the reserve team and Chinese Deputy Detective Tao Shiwei arrived to maintain order, but they punched Detective Tao in the abdomen and threw copper coins and broken glass at him. At that time, Chinese Detective No. 1853 was robbed of his gun and seriously injured in the head, bleeding a lot. He is now being treated at the Shijiang Hospital. Detective Tao was injured in the abdomen and is being treated at the police hospital. Both of them cannot be present in court. Other Western detectives, such as Captain Carnatai, Detective Crawford, and Western Detectives Ma Fei and Lizusi, were slightly injured. It was found that the defendants in this case were all those who actually started the fight on the spot. Defendants 1, 2, 5, 6, and 4 completely destroyed the machine bicycles used by the police officers, making them unusable. The rest of the people threw stones and destroyed the glass windows. The third defendant, Zhou Bu Yu, held a horn. The eleventh defendant, Qiu Jinhua, was the most fierce, shouting loudly, and seemed to be the leader, etc. Western detectives also successively testified, proving the situation at the time. When questioned, the 11 defendants all gave evasive statements and denied committing the crime. Judge Tan ordered that the case be adjourned to next Monday and that Detective Tao and others be questioned again after they recover from their injuries. The defendants were returned to the police station.</p>
<p>Also, Feng Wanxiang, Zhao Baoan, Chen Xijiang, Zhou Chenglin, Yang Wulin, Yang Xuelong, Wu Jinbiao, Bao Zuogui, Hua Busheng, Chou Shunrong, Bao Shuangquan, Zhou You, Wang Mingchang, Dong Dechun, Mei Xuewu and 15 others, who were arrested by Xinzha and Chengdu Road police stations for robbing rickshaw pullers of their armbands, were sent to the Criminal Division 2 of Special Court No. 1 yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunji prosecuted them for obstructing freedom under Article 304 of the Criminal Law. Chinese Detective Xing Peisong then testified that after the defendants were dispersed by the police at the Mackinnon Road registration office, they formed groups of three or four and went to various places to rob rickshaw pullers of their armbands. After Judge Chuan Lin interrogated the defendants, he ordered that the sentence be adjourned to next Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Franconia and China Liners Collide <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Location: Outside Qingdao</p>
<p>Franconia Unharmed</p>
<p>China Liner's Bow Damaged</p>
<p>The China Liner, managed by Zhengji Company of this port and owned by the Overseas Trading Company, has a total cargo capacity of 8,700 tons, a gross tonnage of 6,026 tons, a registered tonnage of 3,571 tons, a length of 417 feet 6 inches, a width of 53 feet 6 inches, a depth of 28 feet 5 inches, and a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour. On the 4th of this month, it departed from Dalian to</p>
<p>Miike and Donggang</p>
<p>to load cargo. At 7:45 AM on the 8th, when traveling to 119 degrees 44 minutes east longitude and 24 degrees 36 minutes north latitude, near the Qingdao sea, while proceeding forward, it happened to encounter the world cruise liner Franconia, which was traveling from Shanghai to Qinhuangdao, due to foggy weather.</p>
<p>Violent Collision at Sea</p>
<p>The Franconia has a huge hull and solid steel plates and did not suffer heavy damage. However, the China Liner's bow was severely damaged after the collision. At that time, the ship owner immediately telegraphed the Dalian headquarters to report and requested instructions on whether to repair it nearby, because the damage was so great that it was difficult to navigate. Yesterday, the company telegraphed Shanghai, saying that the China Liner had been ordered to sail to</p>
<p>Qingdao for Repairs</p>
<p>as a temporary measure, both to maintain safety and to avoid losses due to delays. The Shanghai China Ship Insurance Association, upon receiving this telegram, informed the Zhengji Company that it would allow the ship to enter the dock in Qingdao. However, regarding the inspection of the damage, it would allow Mr. Tang Danhua of the Insurance Association to specially appoint ship inspectors Sheng Pingru or Xu Zufan to go to Qingdao from Shanghai for inspection to clarify the damage situation. In addition to receiving a simple telegram about the collision causing severe damage, the Shanghai company has not yet received a detailed telegram, so the details are still not fully known.</p>

After the conference is completed, it will be reported to the Army Central Department, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Eight Overseas Chinese from Russia, Men and Women, Return to Shanghai <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Four Repatriated by Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that eight overseas Chinese residing in Voronezh, Soviet Union, including Ye Jinshan (who married a Russian wife locally and has a son and a daughter, all of whom returned to China together), Jiang Dezai (who also married a Russian wife who came with him), Ye Xiongfei, and Chen Ji, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 14th on a ship from Vladivostok. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau contacted China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to purchase half-price tickets for Ye Jinshan, his Russian wife, and children, and sent them back to their original home in Qingtian, Zhejiang, on the Haiyan ship that evening. Jiang Dezai (and his Russian wife), Ye Feixiong, Chen Ji and others were temporarily settled at the Yuelai Inn at the Dadama Pier in the South City, preparing to send them to work in Qiaole Village. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter interviewed Jiang Dezai, a distressed overseas Chinese who had returned to China. According to him, their group of eight left Moscow at the beginning of last month and arrived in Vladivostok. They were stranded for more than 20 days waiting for the ship before they were able to take a ship to Shanghai. He also said that when they left Moscow, there were still 16 overseas Chinese who also planned to return to China, but they were unable to do so due to lack of travel expenses. They are now requesting the Chinese embassy in Russia to find a way to send them back. Although they had some savings from running small businesses in Russia, they were all in Russian rubles. Due to the country's regulations, they were confiscated by the Russian police when they boarded the ship in Vladivostok, so their situation is extremely difficult, he said.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of submitting a request: On the 13th of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, 'Shanghai is the center of the country, and the trademarks of products from various merchants and factories are also the best in other ports in Shanghai. Therefore, the former Ministry of Industry moved the Trademark Registration Bureau to Shanghai to facilitate industry and commerce, which was well-intentioned. Recently, in order to save money, the Ministry moved the Trademark Bureau back to the capital, which caused merchants and factories in Shanghai to feel quite inconvenienced when handling trademark registration procedures. The back and forth of mail and telegrams is quite inconvenient, and there are often approvals, rejections, and revisions that cannot be made clear in writing. If applicants need to make oral representations, or the organizers need to inquire about something, the distance between Beijing and Shanghai makes it very difficult to travel back and forth. Considering that at the beginning of the National Government's establishment in Nanjing, a Trademark Bureau office was established in Shanghai, we hereby request your association to forward this request to the Ministry of Industry, to follow the old example and establish a Trademark Bureau office in Shanghai, which would not be contrary to the government's intention to save money, and would also take into account the convenience of industry and commerce,' etc. We have received it and have prepared a document to forward it accordingly, hoping that your ministry will consider and adopt it, as it would be in the public interest."</p>

It is expected that if there are no special changes in the weather in the summer and autumn seasons, this year's cotton production will definitely increase by twenty to thirty percent compared to last year, it is said.</p>

<p>Registration Begins Today</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Chinese Flying Club, sponsored by the Chinese Aviation Association, has achieved remarkable results. People in China and overseas Chinese have joined in droves, with an average of dozens of new members joining every day, which shows the Chinese people's recognition and attention to aviation. In order to stimulate the aviation interest of its members, the club previously organized free aerial sightseeing flights from the 1st of last month. So far, eleven flights have been held, and the participants have been very enthusiastic. Even people from other cities have come to Shanghai to participate. However, the free sightseeing flights held in the previous times were only limited to the members of the club, which inevitably disappointed the citizens. Now that the spring is bright and the sun is warm, it is most suitable for aerial sightseeing. The club specially organized civilian aerial sightseeing flights, so that all citizens of the city have the opportunity to enjoy aerial sightseeing. Participants only pay an oil fee of five yuan, and the club will provide cars for transportation to and from the flying field, without charging any additional fees. It has been decided that registration will begin today (the 16th). Those who are interested in participating can register directly at the club's office on Luban Road.</p>

<p>French Concession Limits the Nailing of Magnetic Plates, Guild Raises Conditions</p>
<p>Preventing Car Theft: Car Owners Organize Non-Redemption Group: Because the French Concession requires magnetic plates to be nailed onto rickshaws in Nanshi, they raised conditions to the French Municipal Council yesterday. Zhabei rickshaw owners, in order to prevent car theft, organized a non-redemption group. Details are compiled below:</p>
<p>Nanshi: Because the French Concession plans to add magnetic plates and hard stamps to rickshaws, the rickshaw guild decided through a meeting to send representatives led by Zhang Huaiyang to the French Municipal Council yesterday to propose exchange conditions. The rickshaw owners accept the nailing of magnetic plates and the stamping, but request: 1. The Municipal Council shall not conduct vehicle inspections in the future. 2. If the license is lost, a temporary permit shall be issued. 3. Fines for rickshaw pullers violating regulations should be reduced to twenty cents, as in the British Bureau of Public Works. 4. When donating licenses, old licenses should be exchanged every other month. If the old license is lost, a replacement fee of one cent per license will be charged. Zhao Bingsheng received them and promised to reply on the 16th.</p>
<p>Zhabei: The Zhabei Rickshaw Guild, in order to prevent car theft, specially formed a non-redemption group. A notice was issued yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern: The Nanshi car owners in this association pioneered the trial of non-redemption groups last year, stipulating car compensation methods. We have been honored by the consideration of the Public Security Bureau's branch offices and police stations for the suffering of rickshaw pullers, and great attention has been paid to car theft criminals. Car theft criminals such as Liu Chengsong have been arrested successively and sent to the local court and vagrant work training center for separate treatment. The other accomplices have also been slightly restrained. Recently, it has been found that some parts of the North City take car theft as a regular occupation, such as Wu Shida and 20 others, who do not know how to repent and dare to act recklessly, causing the car owners and rickshaw pullers to suffer greatly. This association has reported this to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau in Cai Ju Wei Fa No. 147, which replied, 'The report is noted, and has been forwarded to the relevant bureaus and detective squads for information. Please inform accordingly.' Now, in order to prevent car theft and extortion in the North City, the car owners in the North City are also raising funds to organize non-redemption groups in accordance with the Nanshi method, and will implement the non-redemption group charter from April. We hope that the Public Security Bureau's branch offices, police stations, and detective squads in Zhabei Zhongxing Road, Datong Road end, and Chaosu Bang and other places will strictly investigate and arrest (the above-mentioned) car theft criminals and bring them to justice in order to warn others and maintain commerce. The car owners and rickshaw pullers will be extremely grateful. This notice is hereby given for your information."</p>

<p>The Ning Shao Water and Fire Insurance Company has a substantial business and an outstanding reputation. The position of General Manager was originally held concurrently by Mr. Hu Yongqi. However, due to Mr. Hu's current role as General Manager of Ning Shao Life Insurance Company and Chairman of the Insurance Association, he is overwhelmed with affairs and unable to attend to both, so he has submitted his resignation.

<p>Zheng Huicheng, Wang Xiaohua, and Yang Nengshen, students who had studied in Germany and at Tongji University, jointly invested in setting up the Practical Science Society in Jiangwan in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933). The society's purpose is research-oriented, and whether creating or imitating, they all start with practical testing. Their manufacturing policy is to make small products with large capital, not seeking a wide variety of products, but seeking the finest quality. After two years of dedicated research and countless setbacks, they finally manufactured the first batch of Arrow Brand Double-Use Insurance Door Locks in February of this year. Their novel design and exquisite materials make them a unique product of China. This door lock has a lever handle with an arrowhead on the inside. When the arrowhead is turned upwards, the handle can be turned to open or close the door from both inside and outside. If the arrowhead is turned downwards, the inside handle can still be used as before, but on the outside, the key must be inserted into the key slot on the handle to turn and open the door. This door lock is not an imitation, but completely created by the society. It is very convenient to use, and its internal structure is very strong and precise. Moreover, no manufacturing material or part is finalized without a long period of testing. The internal springs, bullets, and keys are all made of stainless steel, so they are strong and safe, surpassing foreign products. It has recently been heard that the society plans to add a Type 929 door lock in a special way based on the same principle, to meet the needs of high-end buildings. In the future, there is great hope for development. In addition, in order to promote tourism, the factory has specially printed a map of transportation and tourism in the five southeastern provinces, which is accurately surveyed and includes a train timetable. It is given away free of charge. Anyone who has purchased or will purchase Arrow Brand Double-Use Insurance Door Locks from the general manager's office at Fengyuan Trading Company, 356 Beijing Road, or any agent, will receive one map.</p>

<p>Hou Yuquan, a 26-year-old man from Xinghua, lives at 1387 Gaolang Bridge and runs a pancake shop. His wife, Zhu, is 23 years old and used to work as a female worker at the Shenxin Factory. Recently, she was suddenly fired for some reason. However, Zhu believed that her wages had not been settled, so she went to the factory last night to settle accounts with a female foreman named Ah Er. As a result, nothing was resolved, and they had an argument and parted ways. Unexpectedly, this female foreman, Ah Er, is a notorious female rogue who usually associates with ruffians. She believed that Zhu's visit to demand her wages and make a scene had caused her to lose face. Therefore, at around 1 p.m. yesterday, she incited more than 30 people, including her gigolo and other ruffians, to go to Hou Yuquan's house to make trouble. Without asking why, they started beating people, causing Hou Yuquan, Zhu, Hou's 62-year-old mother Wang, 19-year-old apprentice Wang Derong, and 17-year-old Yuan Maokouzi to be injured. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the crowd dispersed in a chaotic manner. By the time the police arrived, they had all disappeared. The five injured people were taken to the hospital for treatment, and the police are pursuing the perpetrators and the mastermind to investigate.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 5 a.m., Xia Sanbao, a 40-year-old local man who weighs vegetables for a local goods store at the intersection of Datong Road and Taiyang Temple Road in Zhabei, left his home at 48 Meiyuan Road with a package of account books wrapped in newspaper under his arm, heading to the vegetable market to settle accounts. While walking along Datong Road near the railway crossing, three robbers jumped out of the Shunfeng Teahouse and robbed him at the intersection of Taiyang Temple Road. They first slapped Xia in the face, and Sanbao fell to the ground. The robbers then snatched the package of account books under his arm and fled. The robbers mistakenly thought it was legal tender. Unexpectedly, as they were walking along the railway tracks, they opened the package and found that it was all account books. At that time, Sanbao was following behind. Seeing the robbers stop, he blew his police whistle. The robbers abandoned the account books on the road and fled wildly. Afterwards, the victim picked up the account books and reported the incident to the police station.</p>

<p>Yan Caigen, a boat dweller from Huzhou, loaded fresh fish in his hometown of Linghu last month and came to Shanghai, docking his boat at the Nan Shi 16th Pier. At 1 p.m. on the 28th of this month, a conflict arose with a neighboring boat due to a dispute over berthing. Yan Caigen was struck in the back of the head with a bamboo pole, causing a bloody wound. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died the next day due to his injuries. His wife, Yan Gu, filed a lawsuit with the local court. After examination by Prosecutor Zhang, Zhang Fuxing and Zhang Zhengshou, boat dwellers from the same hometown, were arrested and prosecuted for the crime of causing death by injury. Yesterday, Judge Xu of the Criminal Court opened the trial. The defendants' lawyer, Yu Xiufang, appeared in court to defend them. Zhang Fuxing and Zhang Zhengshou testified that they had been watching the goods at night and had not slept all night, so they were asleep when the incident occurred and knew nothing about the conflict. They claimed that they were wrongly accused and requested to be found innocent. The judge noted that the victim's family had not appeared in court and ordered a continued hearing. The defendants were ordered to be detained.</p>

<p>With Extremely Sincere Speech</p>

<p>Mayor Wu's Banquet for Rotary Club Members (Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Guests and Hosts Enjoy Themselves</p>
<p>The occasion was quite grand for a time. At the end of the banquet, Mayor Wu stood up to deliver a welcome speech, which stated in brief: "It is a great honor to have you as distinguished guests here today. This grand gathering has given me a profound impression. Although you are of different nationalities and professions, your arrival in Shanghai to participate in the 81st District Conference is not to represent the interests of a particular race or individual, but to promote the friendship that 'all men are brothers within the four seas.' The purpose of your club's organization is to seek to improve public welfare and improve the state of human life. The factors that cause disharmony among human beings are often due to a lack of understanding. To seek mutual understanding, there is no other way than to put yourself in the other's shoes and treat others as you would like to be treated. Moreover, the purpose of obtaining absolute understanding is not to implement the passive principle of 'do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself,' but to actively use my ability to benefit others. People say that modern commercial competition is very fierce. Those engaged in commerce are all scheming and profit-oriented. However, looking at the actions of the members of your club, it is very different from this. There are also quite a few businessmen who can implement the principles of your club. The establishment of your club has two important missions. On the one hand, it seeks to enable members to serve the society with loyalty and integrity based on the spirit of fair trade. On the other hand, it seeks to promote and develop this spirit, thereby forming a social atmosphere. Shanghai is a major port city. However, in recent years, due to the complexity of society and the stagnation of commerce, the unfortunate people in society have suffered greatly from the oppression of this environment. The members of your club want to implement its purpose, and Shanghai is the place and now is the time. My fellow members, the efforts that society requires of you are both important and great. Based on your usual spirit of sincere service, I dare to believe that this conference will not be just empty talk. I hope that you will gather your thoughts and establish a direction for future service to seek the welfare of human society." After Mayor Wu finished speaking, Dr. Wang Zhengting, Honorary President of the club, replied, saying that he was deeply impressed by the warm reception of the members by Mayor Wu and his wife, and the kind words and delicious food they had received. In addition to China, this Rotary Club meeting in Shanghai also had guests from Hong Kong and the Philippines. He was even more grateful for the invitation to the grand banquet today. Since Mr. Wu Tiecheng has been in charge of Shanghai, the construction of various projects has made daily progress, especially the rapid advancement of education and culture, which is evident to everyone. In addition to admiring this, we wish Shanghai a future of development, and under the leadership of Mayor Wu, we will strive to serve the local area. If the mayor has any orders, we will do our best to carry them out. After the banquet, a commemorative photo was taken in front of the Municipal Government.

<h3 id="e147">Anglo-American-Russian Oil Merchants' Sales Agreement: Russian Oil Merchants Have Withdrawn from the Alliance <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Anglo-American Oil Merchants Are Squeezed Out of the Northeast Market</p>
<p>Japanese Oil Has Difficulty Selling in Shanghai and Seeks Other Development</p>
<p>Dagu She reports that since the puppet Manchukuo promulgated the Petroleum Monopoly Law in November of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), it has implemented a monopoly policy starting on April 1, 1935, and hired Japanese Petroleum Company Director Tsushita Buntaro as an advisor. As a result of the gradual implementation, the business of British Asiatic and American Mobil, which originally had businesses in the Northeast market, was controlled by this monopoly policy and could not conduct business. Yesterday, the reporter learned from the British and American oil merchants here that Asiatic's Liaoning branch has been closed in January of this year, and Mobil's Changchun branch will also close down in the near future.</p>
<p>Three-Country Agreement: Russia Withdraws: In January of last year, British and American oil merchants, in view of the heavy losses caused by the widespread dumping of Russian oil in Shanghai, and in order to avoid competition and maintain the Far East oil market, oil companies such as Asiatic, Mobil, Texaco, etc., and the Russian Oil Corporation (General Manager of Guanghua Company) formed a sales liaison system agreement as a result of a meeting of the heads of various companies to unify prices and raise market prices. It has been more than a year. It is reliably learned that the Russian Oil Corporation recently believes that the three-country agreement is too harsh, and its business development is still restricted by British and American merchants in an intangible way, so it cannot expand its power as much as possible. Therefore, it has automatically announced its withdrawal from the alliance. The oil price will be determined according to the fluctuation of foreign exchange, but it will not be as drastic as the price cuts and dumping last year.</p>
<p>Japanese Oil's Expansion in Shanghai Is Difficult: The Japanese Oil Corporation in this city transported a large amount of Fushun oil from puppet Manchukuo to Shanghai last year and sold it at dumping prices. It also hired the manager of Yinghua Trading Company, intending to compete with the British, American, and Russian oil merchants in the market and try to occupy a part of the market share. Unexpectedly, this oil had too much sedimentation, was of impure quality, and had weak combustion power. Therefore, although its price was cheap, its sales could not be expanded. Now, Japanese merchants are changing their course and seeking to develop in puppet Manchukuo, so the expulsion of other countries' kerosene is becoming more active.</p>

<p>The garden will send people to capture it, but Hangzhou authorities have not yet responded.</p>
<p>The authorities in Hangzhou have not yet responded.</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo is paying close attention to the news that a golden leopard was previously discovered in Majia Mountain, four miles from West Lake in Hangzhou, and was subsequently shot and killed by Jin Xueyuan, the owner of Xinghua Village Restaurant in West Lake. Now, tigers have been found in the mountain again, attacking pedestrians. The reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Request to Capture Tigers: According to the Municipal Zoo, since the zoo's tiger died of lung disease last year, it has sent people to Hong Kong to contact local animal traders and intends to find a tiger in Yunnan, Guizhou, and other places. However, there is still no news of a deal. At the same time, since the zoo saw the report that a leopard was killed in West Lake and now a tiger has been found, the zoo sent a letter to the Hangzhou authorities a few days ago, asking if it was true and requesting permission for the zoo to send people to capture it. However, there has been no reply.</p>
<p>Shen's Return: In addition, Director Shen of the zoo went to Japan last year to study the administration of zoos and the treatment of animal diseases at the Ueno Imperial Gift Zoo. He completed his research as early as last month and then went to various zoos in the country for investigation. He was originally scheduled to return to China on the Empress of Japan from Yokohama on the 18th of this month. Now, we have learned that Shen has sent a letter to the park, approving the advance by one day and taking the Asama Maru back to China on the 17th. He will arrive at the Wusong Wharf in this city on the afternoon of the 20th. Shen will also bring a bear (ie, human bear) and many other small animals, which will be displayed in the park.</p>

<p>Zhang Qiao's Gold Jewelry Harmed, Lu Guisheng Surrenders to the Police</p>
<p>Zhang Xigen, from Menghe, lives on the upper floor of No. 10 Baoyu Lane, Wuzhou Road, Hongkou. He runs a beef stall at the Xiaocai market in Hongkou Triangle. His wife, Qiao, is only 21 years old. Zhang used to hire a shop assistant named Lu Guisheng, 20 years old, from Gaoqiao, Pudong, and invited him to live on the third floor of his house. On the 9th of this month, Lu Guisheng suddenly claimed that he would also set up his own stall and sublet the house. He moved out in the early morning. At the time, Zhang and Qiao did not pay attention. Who knew that Lu Guisheng saw that Zhang had some savings and had bad intentions. At about 3 a.m. yesterday, he used the original key to the door of the house to open the door and hid on the third floor. When Zhang Xigen went out to work at about 3:30 a.m., he climbed down the rope from the third floor and entered Zhang Qiao's bedroom. Seeing that she was wearing a gold locket around her neck, he took off the locket necklace while she was still in a dream. But because of his lack of skill, he woke Qiao up. She was shocked and screamed. Lu Guisheng was panicked and anxious, and knowing that he had been recognized, he was afraid that he would not be able to escape. So, he took out a sharp blade from his side and stabbed Qiao five times in a row. He took the stolen goods and ran downstairs. When the housemates woke up to check, Qiao had fallen in a pool of blood, but she was still able to speak. She asked the housemates to call her husband back and told him what had happened. Zhang Xigen rushed to the Jiaxing Road Police Station to report the incident. He also took Qiao to Shanghai Sanatorium for treatment. It is reported that Qiao was stabbed once in the face, twice in the left hand, once in the back, and once in the head, which is quite serious. The murderer Lu Guisheng knew that he could not escape after committing the crime, so he surrendered to the police station yesterday afternoon. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, he was temporarily detained, and he will be sent to the court for investigation today.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Young Woman Requests Confirmation that Divorce Agreement is Invalid <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Confession Obtained by Deception</p>
<p>Bribed Bailiff Dismissed</p>
<p>Lu Renjin, a young local woman living at No. 10 Yongyu Lane, Lafayette Road, French Concession, was sued for theft by her husband, Lu Changfa (aka Qian Zhongliang), who works at the Star Grand Theater, in the Second Special District Court last month. After court debate, both parties reconciled, Lu paid bail and was released. Then, Qian published a statement in the newspaper saying that he had divorced Lu. Both parties held an agreement signed as proof. Recently, Lu Renjin commissioned lawyer Xu Wufang and others to file a petition with the Civil Court of the Second Special District Court, requesting confirmation that the divorce agreement signed with Lu Changfa was invalid. The court granted the request and summoned them for questioning yesterday. First, Lu's lawyer stated that on the 27th of last month, the plaintiff was ordered to pay a 100-yuan bail due to a criminal case sued by Lu Changfa. At that time, she was detained in the bail room waiting for bail. Lu Changfa's lawyer bribed a bailiff with 5 yuan in legal tender to go to the bail room and persuade the plaintiff to repent so that she could be released. He also asked the plaintiff to sign a paper, claiming that it was a confession. The plaintiff was illiterate and signed a cross. After being released on bail, she learned that the document that the defendant's lawyer had asked her to sign was actually a divorce agreement. Therefore, she legally requested confirmation that the divorce agreement was invalid. The defendant's lawyer requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed, stating that the defendant, Qian Zhongliang, had agreed with the plaintiff to divorce, and a divorce agreement was written in the lawyer's rest room. At that time, because the plaintiff's lawyer, Xu Wufang, was not present, Qian Zhongliang asked a matchmaker, Mr. Lin, and a relative, Mr. Yan, to sign on the divorce agreement as proof. They then went to the bail room with the permission of the bailiff and read out the divorce agreement. Lu Renjin agreed to sign it and made a cross on the stamp. At that time, there were three bailiffs present, who did not say that the divorce agreement was a confession, and there was no bribery. Lawyer Chen then submitted a photo of the divorce agreement as evidence and stated that if it was a confession, only one signature would be required. For a divorce agreement, two copies are required, each holding one copy, etc. When questioned, the plaintiff said that on that day, Lawyer Chen went upstairs to the bail room alone, and the document he read was to make me confess. I only signed one copy. I had no prior conversations with my husband. The court immediately summoned two bailiffs who were on duty in the bail room that day for questioning. Both claimed that they knew nothing about it. Judge Tu Shenjie declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 3 p.m. on the 20th of this month. It is heard that one of the bailiffs involved in the bribery in the case has been identified by the court authorities after being reported by the plaintiff and has been notified to the police station for dismissal.</p>

<p>A Goddess's Life Filled with Suffering</p>
<p>Secretly Escapes, Only to Be Found by Uncle</p>
<p>Liu Jindi, a maiden from Changzhou, seventeen years of age and of comely appearance, was betrothed as a child bride to a Mr. Wu from the same locality at the age of nine due to her family's poverty, arranged by a matchmaker. For several years, they lived in harmony. However, in the eighth month of last year, Ms. Liu suddenly fell in love with a shop assistant surnamed Wu. Deeply in love, they vowed to be together forever, packed their belongings, and eloped, hiding in the Zhoujiaqiao area of western Shanghai. Soon after, the girl's father found and took her back. The Wu family, deeming the girl's behavior too romantic, immediately annulled the engagement. The girl's father, feeling that his daughter had disgraced the family, through the mediation of the girl's uncle, Liu Jinbin (age forty-nine, residing in Lianyifang on Shima Road, a tailor by trade), sold the girl to Fan Mingrui's brothel at No. 77 Wuma Road for 200 yuan, with a five-year term stipulated. From then on, the girl led a life of a goddess, welcoming Zhang and seeing off Li, enduring unbearable suffering. She lived a precarious existence, swallowing her tears and stifling her sobs. On February 3rd, she seized an opportunity and secretly escaped, taking refuge in the Baoshan Hostel on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. After losing the girl, Fan turned to the girl's father and uncle, Liu Jinbin, demanding her return. Liu then searched everywhere and, at four o'clock yesterday afternoon, found the girl by the roadside on Baoshan Road and forcibly dragged her back. The girl firmly resisted, leading to a quarrel. Noticing this, the police officers of the Shanzhang Precinct brought them to the North Station Branch, where the whole story came to light. Considering the case involved selling a free person into prostitution, a violation of the law, the police prepared a report and sent it to the Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Dancer's Left Wrist Tendon Severed, Continental Ballroom Employee Arrested <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Multiple Witnesses Identify Liang Shaoqian as the Culprit; Manager Zhou Yaorong's Involvement Still Under Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Weiling from Wuxi, an employee of Da Zhonghang at No. 505 Henan Road, went to the Continental Ballroom at No. 33 Ningbo Road on the evening of the 9th of this month with his colleague Song Zhibiao and friend Yang Jingmu to dance. Chen and Song, not being good dancers, sat and drank tea, while only Yang chose a partner to dance. At 2:00 AM, when the ballroom closed, they all left. A Cantonese employee of the ballroom named Liang Shaoqian (also known as A Liang) assumed that Chen and the others were just there to drink tea and suspected that Yang had not purchased a dance ticket. He gathered more than ten people to pursue and confront Chen and his companions. Just then, two Western police officers happened to pass by and dispersed them, preventing any incident from occurring. However, at 11:30 PM on the 10th, Chen and his companions passed by the Continental Ballroom again. As soon as they sat down, Liang Shaoqian and the manager Zhou Yaorong suddenly appeared and dragged Chen and Song out of the ballroom, claiming that Chen and the others had deliberately come to retaliate for the previous night's incident. At this point, more than forty thugs, pre-arranged and hiding in the cloakroom, rushed out. More than ten of them carried sharp knives, and Liang Shaoqian also drew a knife, slashing Chen Weiling's left wrist, causing profuse bleeding. Song Zhibiao was also beaten and injured in the face. One Zhu Minggui (also known as A Ming), considered an associate of Chen, was also stabbed in the back. During the assault, the ballroom neither reported to the police nor allowed the patrolman No. 1121 on duty to close the iron gate, preventing Chen and the others from escaping. After Chen and the others were injured, the thugs scattered. Another dancer used his private car, No. 5995, to take Chen and Zhu, the two injured men, to Renji Hospital for treatment. The hospital notified the General Police Department, which ordered detectives Wang Bocheng, Ren Fengwu, Wang Yingjie, and He Renrui to investigate. Unable to immediately identify the culprits, no arrests were made. Now, the injured Chen Weiling and Zhu Minggui, along with witnesses Song Zhibiao and Tian Zhongyu, have firmly identified Liang Shaoqian as the ringleader, and Chen and Zhu's injuries as having been inflicted by Liang himself. The police department then obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special Court and arrested Liang at the Continental Ballroom on the previous day. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang charged him with causing serious injury under Article 278, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, stating that Chen Weiling's left wrist tendon had been severed, as certified by the hospital. Even if he recovers, his hand will be unable to function, resulting in permanent disability, and excessive blood loss poses a threat to his life. The hospital is currently performing surgery, and the results have not yet been reported to the police department. The police department is still investigating Zhou Yaorong's involvement. Therefore, the case has been requested for rescheduling. Subsequently, Zhu Minggui, Song Zhibiao, and Tian Zhongyu all testified that the assailant was indeed the defendant Liang Shaoqian. When questioned, Liang admitted to the events of the 9th but completely denied any involvement in the assault on the 10th. Judge Qian Hongye, after reviewing the evidence, ordered the defendant Liang Shaoqian to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for next Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e159">The Straw Hat Industry in Shanghai (Continued) <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Chief Editor, China Credit Information</p>
<p>(A Survey of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, No. 22)</p>
<p>Export Trading Firms: Previously, due to fluctuations in exchange rates, the risks were significant. With the currency reform and stable foreign exchange, the straw hat market has calmed down. Business operations are now more stable.</p>
<p>Shanghai Hat Factories: Those that solely produce straw hats are usually small in scale. Larger factories stipulate that their output must not exceed a certain amount of capital to avoid dumping. However, due to the large number of competitors, price-cutting is still unavoidable. In recent years, the operating results of major factories often show losses in straw hats, which are compensated for by felt hats. This indicates that straw hat business has become unprofitable. Straw hats in Shanghai used to be sold in department stores, but now they are mainly sold in shoe stores, reflecting the changes in the market.</p>
<p>(5) Sales Channels for Straw Hats: Exported straw hats are mainly sold to the United Kingdom and the United States, followed by France and Australia. Between 1915 and 1916, Wenzhou mat hats were already being exported, but in small quantities and through foreign firms. After 1926, the straw hat business flourished, with high-quality goods being the main export, reaching a value of 20 million yuan annually. By 1932, the export volume remained the same, but the market price had fallen, and exports were mostly low-end goods. The sales ratio of hemp hats to gold silk hats was approximately 5:2, resulting in a decrease in value. Subsequently, the situation deteriorated further. According to the customs records of 1935, the value was only 4 million yuan, but the actual figure should be higher. Straw hat exports were previously tax-exempt. For convenience, straw hat merchants often mixed various colors of straw hats and declared them as hemp hats, which further reduced their value. According to an estimate by a straw hat industry insider, the average annual export of straw hats is 6 million pieces, with the following values:</p>
<p>1931: 20 million yuan</p>
<p>1932: 19 million yuan</p>
<p>1933: 12 million yuan</p>
<p>1934: 7 million yuan</p>
<p>1935: 6 million yuan</p>
<p>The largest sales market for Shanghai straw hats is Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, followed by Hankou, Xiamen, Shantou, and Guangzhou. North China is supplied by Tianjin hat factories, and sales are minimal. In recent years, straw hat factories have become widespread in inland areas because weaving is simple and does not require significant capital or advanced technology. This has had a significant impact on the sales of Shanghai straw hats. There are no statistics on Shanghai straw hat sales, but we can estimate them based on the sales volume of straw braids. The recent annual consumption of straw braids in Shanghai is approximately 4,000 bales. With each bale producing 50 dozen hats, this amounts to 200,000 dozen. Adding wax thread manufacturing and imports, the number should be close to 300,000 dozen.</p>
<p>Imports of foreign straw hats are rare because domestic products are cheaper and difficult to compete with. Panama straw hats and other types are becoming luxury items sold by dealers. However, industry insiders say that Japanese paper hats will be imported this year, which will have a significant impact on the market.</p>
<p>(6) Market Prices for Straw Hats: Straw hat prices have been declining steadily since 1930, never recovering. There are several reasons for this: 1. Excessive Prices: During booming times, export traders hoarded inventory, raising prices. When the market declined, a reaction occurred. 2. Weak Purchasing Power in Various Countries: People are trying to save on similar luxury goods. Therefore, straw hat sales have become sluggish. 3. Competition from Japanese paper hats and Italian coarse hats: If export traders do not compete, no one will buy their products. 4. Excessive Inventory in Our Country: Traders have to sell at reduced prices. As a result, the market is characterized by long periods of stagnation and short periods of brisk sales. Glass straw hats, which sold for a high of 14 yuan per piece in 1930, have now fallen to 2.5 yuan. The severity of the decline is rare. The following is a comparison of prices between 1930 and the recent prices (unit: piece, yuan):</p>
<p>(Note 1, 2) Based on standard goods (Note 3) Based on super goods</p>
<p>The decline in domestic straw hat prices is no less severe than that of exports. High-quality straw hats sold for 30 yuan per dozen in 1930, but now they have fallen to 10 yuan. The lowest-quality coarse straw hats sell for only 45 cents per dozen. If high-quality and lower-quality goods are considered together, the current market price has fallen by more than 65% compared to 1930. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e161">Past Achievements Surpassed <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The formal national billiards competition in Shanghai began with the China-England billiards matches. Since its inception, it has been held for three sessions. Chinese talents have emerged in large numbers, surpassing previous achievements. Therefore, they have won three consecutive sessions, earning unparalleled international honors for our Chinese people. In the previous third session, the Chinese representatives Li Gongying, Zhang Yingda, Xu Shizhang, Ding Mingyi, and Ye Zhuo went through many twists and turns before finally achieving the final victory, which was especially commendable. This session, Zhang Yingda has gone to Qingdao, Xu Shizhang remains in Sichuan, and Ye Zhuo was unable to participate due to other commitments. Therefore, Shen Lince, Hu Changyuan, and Wu Chengqi have been selected to supplement the team. Their fighting strength seems better than in previous years.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Review of This Session's Strength <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The strength of the China and England teams in this session is very even, making it difficult to predict the outcome. According to various observations, Wu Chengqi has a better chance of winning in the first match, and Li Gongying is quite confident in the fifth match. Shen Lince, Hu Changyuan, and Ding Mingyi are all highly skilled, but their opponents are seasoned veterans with rich experience, making it difficult to win. The final victory will depend on the outcome of these three matches. The eight characters "equal strength, suitable opponents" can be used to describe the two teams in this session.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Brief History of Chinese Representatives <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The representatives of the Chinese team are all the best of the time. They all have a significant history with billiards. Li Gongying is naturally the main player of the Chinese team. He is known as the "King of Billiards" for his outstanding skills, alongside Li Huitang, the King of Football, and Zhu, the King of Handball, as the "Three Kings". Shen Lince has the longest history with billiards. He is currently working in Nanjing and has earned the title of "King of Billiards in Nanjing". He has specially come to Shanghai to serve the Chinese team, which is admirable. Ding Mingyi's billiards skills are similar to Zhang Yingda, the runner-up in this year's amateur senior competition. In every competition, his results are better than usual. Hu Changyuan has received guidance from Li Gongying and has skillful techniques. He often makes surprising moves. If he can remain calm during the match, he will not fail. Wu Chengqi, who will play in the first match today, is the fourth-place winner of the Chinese Open Billiards Championship organized by the Chinese Billiards Association. He is very confident and steady, often scoring seventy or eighty points. Therefore, he has a 60-70% chance of winning against England's Graham.</p>

<p>The former Shanghai tycoon Chengzhong came from a humble background.

<h3 id="e186">Revitalizing the Nation and Rescuing Street Children (2) <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Zhen</p>
<p>Broadcast Speech by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, there should be the following methods for rescuing street children:</p>
<p>First, the government should set up orphan and poor factories according to the local production situation, take in and educate orphans and poor children, teach them specialized skills, and enable them to serve in the factory and produce for the country after they become adults. In this way, orphans and poor children can receive education in their youth, and will not be degraded due to unemployment after they grow up. At the same time, the country's construction undertakings will be easily prospered, which is of the greatest benefit.</p>
<p>Second, the government should universally set up orphan and poor vocational training centers. The establishment of orphan and poor vocational training centers has been established in many places in the country, but it is not universal. Our proposal now is that every city and town with a population of a certain number or more must set up an orphan and poor vocational training center to take in and raise orphans and poor children, and teach them the skills needed by local occupations. After they grow up, they will be introduced to vocational factories so that they can live independently.</p>
<p>Third, expand the existing public orphan and poor education and nurturing homes. We have already said earlier that the number of orphans and poor children that all the existing orphan and poor education and nurturing homes can accommodate is far from the number of street children. Especially in urban areas, street children can be seen everywhere. This is not only the greatest harm to the future of the nation, but also a great obstacle to the appearance of the city in terms of tidying up the city. Therefore, the existing orphan and poor education and nurturing homes in the cities should be expanded as soon as possible, and those that have not yet been established should be established as soon as possible according to the previous method. All local street children should be forcibly taken into orphan and poor education and nurturing homes or vocational training centers by the government, and taught skills and knowledge, so that they can be self-reliant after they reach adulthood.</p>
<p>Fourth, reward and subsidize private orphan and poor education and nurturing homes. Private orphan and poor education and nurturing homes are basically private charitable undertakings, but if the owner is not right or the management is not good, it is easy to cause malpractices. Moreover, private orphan and poor education and nurturing homes are naturally often lack of funds because they are charitable organizations of individuals or groups. Therefore, private orphan and poor education and nurturing homes should be subsidized by the government on time, and their performance should be supervised and rewarded at any time.</p>
<p>Fifth, improve the inheritance system and reward the custom of adopting children. We have already said earlier that under the patriarchal society in our country, the people of the country attach great importance to the concept of lineage. Wealthy people who do not have children often use the excuse of not having a son, and those who have children use the excuse of serving two families to take three wives and four concubines to seek a son, and are not criticized by society. But if they adopt other people's children as their own, they will be opposed by the clan. The adopted son is often not allowed to inherit the inheritance or enjoy the same education as the direct descendants. Therefore, the custom of adopting children is not developed in the provinces in the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins, and there are particularly many street children. On the other hand, in Guangdong, Fujian and other provinces, we see a custom of adopting adopted sons, that is, people with middle-class or above income, even if they have their own sons, still adopt other people's children. After these adopted sons grow up, they are often very capable of making money for their adoptive parents. We will not discuss the purpose of the adopters of this custom, but because the custom of adopting adopted sons is created, street children are naturally reduced. Therefore, when we talk about rescuing street children, the custom of adopting sons should be rewarded, and at the same time, the psychology of despising adopted sons and the inheritance system should be reformed.</p>
<p>Many funds are needed, but after the event is held, although it takes a lot of funds at the beginning, as long as the orphan factory and the joint art institute are run well, they can have a large amount of production. We hope that the government will select a plan and implement it gradually, and at the same time hope that all sectors can help the government and find ways to organize the fifth method of rewarding adopted sons, which does not require public funds, but only requires private individuals to promote it. In summary, today's children are the life of the recent ethnic group. We want to revitalize the ethnic group and demand the future health and prosperity of the ethnic group. We must earnestly plan to educate the current out-of-school children, and we must earnestly plan to rescue the current street children. There is one more point that we want to explain that adopting orphans and poor children is generally considered a charitable cause. The so-called charitable cause is just a random donation by benevolent gentlemen outside of their duties, or a sympathy for the benefits that must be given. But now the street children have nowhere to go, and it is not the street children's own fault. The society has street children, which is a social pathology, a bad influence of the property system. Therefore, rescuing street children is the due responsibility of the government and society, and it is the due responsibility of ordinary, more fortunate people for the less fortunate people. Therefore, we want to say that rescuing street children is not only a charitable donation, but simply a national obligation of our people in the process of national rejuvenation. (End)</p>

<p>Large Volumes Emerge, Further Drop of 2.5 Yuan, Trading Gradually Picks Up</p>
<p>Yesterday, being the last day of the May futures contract, the gold market held its customary swap trading. Sellers offered a premium of over five yuan, but market sentiment remained weak. Sellers asserted dominance, and large bullish positions emerged, breaking the 40 yuan level. At the start of the morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and the US remain flat. Traders indicated that after closing, India was buying above the quoted price of 125, with few sellers and firm prices. Forward silver prices in Mumbai narrowed by one to four basis points.

Demand and supply were uneven after the opening, rising and falling intermittently, hovering around 41 yuan, appearing slightly erratic. HSBC Bank announced its official rates, with both British and American rates remaining unchanged. At this point, sentiment was still relatively stable, with a slight rebound. However, the swap premium rose slightly, causing panic among bullish parties. However, because the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, prices fell midway despite multiple positions. Inevitably, selling pressure prevailed, and bullish parties painfully liquidated, with large players cutting long positions. Thus, supply exceeded demand, breaking the 40 yuan barrier, once falling to 1139 yuan. The foreign exchange market was still flat. Some support emerged after the fall, but the overall trend remained difficult to revive. A slight consolidation occurred at the end.

The morning replenishment was 1134 yuan, and within the swap account, all May contracts were treated as 1141 yuan. The spot market situation was stable, with "cooked red" trading at a premium of ten yuan but lacking transactions. Tianjin goods traded at a premium of ten and a half yuan, with Ying Feng Heng buying 350 taels. It is heard that the supply from Xiamen has been quite abundant recently, but the appetite of each spot firm is limited. As for the spot trading of May futures, yesterday Ying Feng Heng sold 70 contracts to Da Chang Xiang, with Da Chang Xiang paying a premium of 3.4 yuan.</p>

<p>Both Bulls and Bears Engage in Swap Trading: Transactions Become Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw the market continue to rise and trading become more active. Swap trading in the market was quite lively. Bullish parties seized the opportunity to lift prices, hoping for short covering by bearish parties, thereby facilitating their own exit. Therefore, only one or two buyers were seen in the market, with very few joining in. Although there were rumors of borrowed items outside the market, they were unrelated to the rise and fall of government bonds, and the financial community had no intention to engage in this. Yesterday, the morning opening was the most lively, with nearly three million in transactions in a single session, which was particularly rare. Due to swap trading by both bulls and bears, although the purchase volume of numbers 4, 11, and 35 was not large, they failed to lift prices. Selling parties such as numbers 20, 40, and 47, as well as swap trades by bullish parties, were all active, and the order book still saw more demand than supply, continuing to rise sharply. The C-class bond for this month rose by as much as 0.55 yuan, and the rest also rose uniformly by 0.2-0.4 yuan. Bullish parties slightly trimmed their positions in the closing session, mostly retreating by a small 0.1-0.2 yuan. Morning transactions accounted for two-thirds of the entire day. After the afternoon opening, number 4 and others lifted prices again, and market prices continued to rise. The D-class bond also rose by 0.5 yuan, and the rest continued to rise by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Closing transactions were cleared, and the market situation tended to be chaotic, mostly retreating by a small 0.05-0.2 yuan. The overall result for the day was a uniform continued rise of 0.2-0.5 yuan, while the gold long bond rose by 0.7 yuan. Bond 96 tended to be sluggish, with a total transaction volume of 5.16 million yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e189">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Hovers Uncertainly <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, and the situation is hovering again. However, the funds absorbed by gold merchants and the financial community remain unchanged. Only, the industry tends to short, and also hold on tightly. This shows the fierce competition between the two sides. However, the need for spot yarn is inevitably too weak. Judging from the market situation, the current situation will not escape the consolidation.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls and Then Returns, Marked Yarn's Front Market Opens, The overseas yarn and cotton market turned downstream, and people were relaxed and the selling power was slightly stronger. The market gradually declined, but the transaction was not strong, and the bulls of the gold industry merchants did not let go from beginning to end. As a result, the price of each month fell by three, six, seven, and eight cents to one yuan compared with the closing price of the previous day. After the opening of the afternoon market, the situation was mediocre. With the activities of the sellers, the market was scattered, and the Osaka Sanpin yarn fell by 1.45 yuan. However, raw cotton rose, and people's hearts were revitalized. The market price rose again, and as a result, the price of each month rose by three, four, six, and eight cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. Gengfeng sold 1,300 packages, Shenchang 400 packages, Hengyi 550 packages, Shenchang 400 packages, Changyu 450 packages, Tonghe 800 packages, Dafu 1,100 packages, and Xingchang 400 packages. Zhunda bought 750 packages, Changji 400 packages, Hengde 550 packages, Shenji 1,000 packages, Dachangcheng 850 packages, Deda 400 packages, Chengji 400 packages, and Xincheng 600 packages. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>

<p>In the near future, although the shorts are preparing 30,000 to 50,000 bales of coarse cotton, the pressure is heavy. However, Tongji's large amount not only does not threaten the end, but also buys in large quantities in May, so a gust of wind is supported by it, and the market atmosphere turns strong in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour market, after the opening in the morning, the months showed a phenomenon of near stability and far falling. The quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago near rose by 0.2 yuan, far rose by 0.5 yuan, Canada was 48 points better. The market's hearts, with this month being the time for old goods, each factory's reserves are not very abundant, so the trend is hovering, which is quite suitable. As for the far months, although the price of foreign wheat rose, the domestic weather was exceptionally smooth, and people's hearts were weak, with many bulls standing against it, and the shorts slightly increased their code, and the trend fell by 0.01 yuan. By the time of the opening in the afternoon, this month still had little change, and the far term was again because the miscellaneous grains fell back, and the hearts of the people returned to the same trend. However, the transaction was not smooth, and the factory did not see a sell-off, so there are still many opportunities for consolidation in the next step.</p>

According to the current situation, if the weather is good and the wheat seedlings are thriving, the hearts of the people will of course loosen and will not be firm.

<p>Customers, Xian, and rice below 60 grains of broken, since the levy of the full tax, the rice market was once tense. Because the cost of foreign broken rice plus 78 corners, it will be difficult to be cost-effective in the future, and other rice will of course follow up in unison. However, the current rice stock is still sufficient, and there is no need for foreign rice to provide assistance, so people's hearts will immediately turn flat. However, the Shanghai merchants have previously set a lot of Siamese rice and broken rice, and it will be difficult to transport them once the tax is added. In recent days, the rice merchants have repeatedly sought solutions with the foreign merchants. Until yesterday, Dingzou Dacheng and other lines negotiated with the foreign merchants to settle the price and settle 2,100 tons. The sample standard price is 4.67 yuan. It is said that after this batch is concluded, there are still several batches, which will also be settled at the same price.</p>
<p>Customers The market situation is both arrival and sales are weak, and the cargo owners are also unwilling to lightly take off with the market. The incoming households only handle slightly from the local street, and the situation is in a mutually suppressed state. Throughout the day, only the local street helped to handle 1,130 packages of Jiangxi rice, 800 packages of Wontai rice, 150 packages of Jiangbei rice, and 70 packages of Siamese rice. The market prices are similar to those of the previous market. After the market, it is necessary to have active real sales and prosperous customers, so that the market price can be built up.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources from each gang, with a total of more than 6,000 stone of goods. The sales market in the local street was due to the warming weather, and the hearts of the people were once again discouraged. The package stomach was only more than 1,000 packages for Dajin and Qingdao gangs, so the market situation turned weak. As a result, the price of thick early japonica rice fell by 0.1 yuan, and the thin rice fell by several points to approximately 0.1 yuan. Du Yangjian has not opened, and the Yinbian Yuan band is soft.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from each road in Hexia, and the way out of each cargo on the market, white japonica rice shop sales were slack, and the transaction was stagnant. Early rice and each pointed Yinbian Yuan slightly had a stomach, and the market price of white japonica rice turned to a small corner, and the price of thin rice was a small number of points, and the price of Yangdujian was also tired by a few points, and the customer's price was peaceful.

<p>— Ji Guoxuan</p>
<p>In the late Ming Dynasty, the nation's internal affairs were in a terrible state: treacherous officials and eunuchs threw the court into utter confusion. The emperor was not particularly knowledgeable, and with the deceit of these individuals, he became virtually blind. Internal problems inevitably led to external troubles. Consequently, the Manchus and the rebel bandits, within a few decades, overturned the Ming Dynasty's two-hundred-year-old legacy! However, the fall of a nation is not necessarily the end, as long as the people's spirit remains alive and they recognize their enemies, there will always be a day of revenge. What is truly frightening is when everyone desires to be a "Han traitor," when everyone believes that national subjugation is merely a minor inconvenience. That would be the true end, with no hope of revenge. For over two hundred years, the Ming Dynasty only instructed scholars to write "eight-legged essays" and pursue fame and fortune, turning them into self-serving individuals with little regard for integrity or patriotism! As long as there was a government position to be had, what difference did it make who was in power? That is why Li Zicheng, a mere bandit leader, was able to march unopposed and occupy thousands of miles of North China. The ease with which people surrendered was truly infuriating! The last emperor of the Ming Dynasty eventually hanged himself on Coal Hill. Although some officials remained loyal and died for the cause, the majority surrendered to the rebel king. Even the esteemed Grand Secretary Wei Zaode was among the first to welcome the rebel soldiers. When the rebel king ascended the throne, Wei Zaode led the crowd in paying homage. The rebel soldiers jokingly placed their feet on his head, and he humbly endured it. What kind of official was this? Later, Wu Sangui, for the sake of his concubine (Chen Yuanyuan) who had been seized by the rebel king, invited the Manchu troops into the pass, instantly changing the political landscape. We Han people endured three hundred years of oppression by foreign rulers. If the people's spirit had not died, how could such a tragedy have occurred?</p>
<p>After capturing Beijing, the Manchu troops (i.e., the Qing troops) divided their forces and marched south, sweeping everything before them. Ming generals either died, fled, or surrendered. Who could stand alone and inflict any damage on the Qing troops? At the time, some patriotic individuals supported Zhu Yousong, a member of the Ming imperial family, to ascend the throne in Nanjing, intending to establish a partial regime like the Eastern Jin and Southern Song dynasties. However, Zhu Yousong was a pampered young man who only knew how to eat, sing, and play. What did he know about restoring the central plains or the ancestral legacy! Moreover, a group of scoundrels were in power, such as Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng, who were skilled at extorting money and womanizing. How could they accomplish anything meaningful? Needless to say, even if there were one or two loyal individuals, they would be excluded, like Shi Kefa, who could only defend Yangzhou in Jiangbei. Although he engaged in fierce battles with the Qing troops, he was ultimately defeated and killed, and even his bones could not be found!</p>
<p>The Qing Dynasty sent Prince Duo Duo to lead a large army to attack Nanjing directly. Zhu Yousong could only offer "non-resistance." Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng, and others had already surrendered. Even the Jiangbei Four Garrisons that had been appointed! Liu Zeqing, Gao Jie, Liu Liangzuo, and Huang Degong had also mostly surrendered. Later, Zhu Yousong was abducted by Garrison Commander Tian Xiong and presented to the Qing army as a gift. This farcical court lasted only a few months! – This occurred in the second year of the Qing Shunzhi reign (1645).</p>
<p>After Prince Duo Duo captured Nanjing, he led his troops eastward. The counties and prefectures along the river, large and small, were captured in a very short period. Because the Qing troops encountered resistance in this area from time to time, they were not as successful as before. Therefore, they engaged in massacre, rape, and plunder without restraint. The misery of national subjugation was experienced by virtually everyone in the Jiangnan region. And the Yan Yingyuan we are about to discuss was one of the most famous figures who resisted the Qing troops. Let me first talk about Yan Yingyuan's background!</p>
<p>His name was Yingyuan, his courtesy name was Liheng. He was originally from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, but his ancestors had served as "imperial guards" in Beijing (which was like the emperor's intelligence team), so his family moved to Tongzhou in Zhili (now Hebei). Yan Yingyuan initially served as the "Capital Granary Ambassador." Since the Yuan Dynasty, grain from the south had been transported north via the Grand Canal to supply the imperial household. It was unloaded in Tongzhou and stored in warehouses. Therefore, Tongzhou had a large granary area, and there were officials in charge of the granaries, called "Tongzhou Granary Ambassador." The grain was then transported to Beijing and stored in warehouses. The official in charge of these warehouses was called "Capital Granary Ambassador." Managing the granary offered ample opportunities for embezzlement and illegal gains. Therefore, the scoundrels of the Qing Dynasty were said to "eat from the granary... sleep in the treasury," referring to this practice. Yan Yingyuan was upright and honest. During his tenure, he vigorously reformed the accumulated malpractices and ensured that every penny went to the public. In the fourteenth year of the Ming Chongzhen reign, he was promoted to Records Keeper of Jiangyin County, Jiangsu. The Records Keeper was a very minor official, only in charge of arrest and patrol matters in the county government, somewhat like the current head of the public security bureau. When Yingyuan took office, the magistrate of Jiangyin County was concurrently serving in another county, leaving the county in a state of anarchy. The pirate Gu Sanma seized this opportunity and led more than a hundred warships straight into Huangtian Port, intending to seize Jiangyin County. Upon hearing this news, everyone in the city was terrified and at a loss. Since the county magistrate was absent, everyone pushed responsibility onto others, and no one dared to take the lead. Yan Yingyuan was outraged and, due to his official duty, could not shirk responsibility. He mounted his horse, inserted his bow and arrows, and ran straight into the street, shouting like a tiger:</p>
<p>"Come on! Heroes! Let's go kill the pirates! —</p>
<p>Heroes, follow me, don't be afraid! —"</p>
<p>Immediately, a thousand people gathered. However, everyone was empty-handed. How could they fight? Yingyuan led them straight to the Zhang family's bamboo ware shop and shouted: "Boss! I trouble you, first lend each of us a bamboo pole — this is everyone's business, don't be afraid! I will be responsible for repaying this debt in the future!" So everyone grabbed a bamboo pole, using it as a makeshift spear, and went out of the city gate, forming a formation on the riverbank. From afar, it looked like a forest of spears, impenetrable! Yingyuan rode his horse along the riverbank, his momentum very valiant. A pirate showed his head from the boat, and Yingyuan shot an arrow, instantly felling him. After a while, another one, and another one. Three arrows brought down three people. Gu Sanma, upon seeing this, could only make a soundless sound, and secretly weighed anchor and fled.</p>
<p>This incident immediately caused a sensation throughout the province. The Provincial Governor, upon hearing this, quickly reported it to the emperor, requesting commendation for his meritorious service and bravery. The imperial court issued an order granting him the special permission to carry a red parasol, sound gongs to clear the way, and display all the ceremonial guards, making him exceedingly awe-inspiring. Such honors were unheard of for a minor Records Keeper, how could this not be envied! However, Yingyuan's luck was not entirely good. Everyone expected him to be specially promoted, but it only resulted in a change to Registrar of Yingde County, Guangdong. The Registrar was no better than the Records Keeper, and Guangdong was so far away. Yingyuan's mother was ill, so he did not set out immediately. Just then, the situation changed completely. Emperor Chongzhen committed suicide, Qing troops entered the pass, and everything changed. Yingyuan's official position naturally became untenable. At this time, Chen Mingxuan had already been appointed as the Records Keeper of Jiangyin County, and Yingyuan retired with his mother to Shasha Mountain in Jiangyin County. This was already the second year of the Qing Shunzhi reign.</p>
<p>A towering wave came: the capture of the Prince of Fu, the shattered dreams of the small court in the southeast, how agitated were the people's hearts! But after all, you were not allowed to live in complacency, the Qing Dynasty's tonsure (that is, shaving the hair and braiding it, Ming Dynasty people's hair was fully grown, combed into a bun shape, hidden in a hat). The order was issued to the counties: meaning "keep your hair and lose your head, keep your head and lose your hair," hair became a sacrifice that was incompatible with the head. Originally, whenever the Qing troops wanted to attack a city, they would first send a proclamation, ordering the people to shave their heads. If the people of that place obeyed the order and shaved their heads, it would be considered surrender, otherwise they would advance troops to attack and carry out a large-scale massacre. This day was the first day of the intercalary June, the weather was gloomy, as if there was going to be a thunderstorm ahead. The county student Xu Yongde heard that the tonsure order had reached Jiangyin, he was full of pain and anger, and his heart seemed to be burning with torches. He first hung the image of Emperor Taizu of Ming in the "Minglun Hall" of the county school, gathered hundreds of scholars, knelt down together, and kowtowed nine times. He cried and shouted: 'I never thought that the world that His Majesty worked so hard to take back from the Mongols would be ruined by a few treacherous officials. It is clear that the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will once again be slaves of foreign races'! This was like a sharp arrow pierced into everyone's heart, immediately exploding the enthusiasm of the people of the whole city. In an instant, tens of thousands of people gathered in Minglun Hall, everyone with tears in their eyes, full of thoughts, you looked at me, I looked at you, unable to say a word, some gritted their teeth, rubbed their fists, some cried out loudly, as if mourning their parents.</p>
<p>Xu Yongde saw that everyone was in a mess, and it was not a good idea. He wiped his tears, stood up, and tried to cheer up, and said to everyone: 'Everyone, the world of the Ming, the world of the Ming that the Taizu Emperor Gao took back from the Mongolian barbarians, was ruined by a few treacherous thieves. The country is dead, and we, the descendants of the Han nationality, will be slaves of foreign races, and we will be the concubines of the Manchurian Tartars. Everyone, Nanjing is also lost, and the Hongguang Emperor was also sold by treacherous officials. Now the captive soldiers have crossed the Yangtze River, and the beautiful rivers and mountains will soon be trampled by the captive soldiers. It is hateful that those officials who guard the city, usually eat the country's thick salary and plunder the people's fat, when the captive soldiers arrive, they either surrender or run away! Now, the tonsure proclamation has been passed to Jiangyin. Everyone, think about it, our body, hair and skin, are given by our parents, how can we destroy them? How can we descendants of Yan and Huang be slaves of the Tartars? Everyone, think about it, are we just sitting and waiting for the country to die, waiting to be slaves?"</p>
<p>After everyone finished listening, they were stunned for a moment, and then someone shouted loudly, 'Damn it! Fight the Tartars, let's fight!'</p>
<p>Then the crowd shouted in a mess: 'Kill the Tartars: fight the Tartars'</p>
<p>'I don't want my old life anymore!'</p>
<p>'Kill the Tartars! Kill! Kill!'</p>
<p>'If you don't kill the Tartars, you are not a good man of the Ming Dynasty! '……'</p>
<p>Everyone shouted in a mess, the sound shook the roof tiles, and some busy people took gongs and basins, walked on the street while beating them, and shouted: 'The Manchurian Tartars are coming to shave our heads, the Jiangshan of the Ming Dynasty is about to end, those who are unwilling to be slaves of the country, let's fight the Tartars!'</p>
<p>As a result, more and more people gathered, and the children followed, raising their heads, widening their eyes and mouths; hearing the adults shouting like crazy, they also shouted together. Xu Yongde knew that the people's hearts were full of grief and anger, so he took advantage of the situation and said: 'Good! We will fight the captives, and defend Jiangyin City to the death! You all have knives, take knives, those who have guns, take guns, those who don't have knives and guns, bamboo poles, wooden sticks, hoes, iron shovels will also do, we must all defend Jiangyin City to the death!'</p>
<p>'Defend Jiangyin City to the death!'</p>
<p>'Defend Jiangyin City to the death!'</p>
<p>Everyone shouted and walked, and rushed to the front of the county government office, shouting together: 'Please come out, Records Keeper Chen, we want to defend Jiangyin City to the death!'</p>
<p>Someone flew like a fly to invite Chen Mingxuan, and first told him about the situation before and after. Chen Mingxuan said calmly: "I have understood what everyone means; I, Chen, am not without hot blood; but my ability is really too poor, I can't compare with the former Records Keeper Yan in any way - he is currently living in leisure, have you all forgotten? Such a big thing, if you don't go to him, who else can bear it? He is now in Shasha Mountain!" Sure enough, these words reminded everyone, and immediately the crowd shouted, "Records Keeper Yan!" ……"Master Yan!" ……"We want to invite Mr. Yan to preside over everything!"</p>
<p>The next day, in the early morning, Yan Yingyuan had already come with the people who welcomed him, with forty servants following behind, the horses all running with sweat. Yingyuan immediately became the leader of the city, he first expressed his opinions to the masses, hoping that everyone would stimulate their conscience and strictly maintain order. He immediately started to work: he read the official documents and stipulated the plan for defending the city, first repaired the fortresses and city walls everywhere; ordered each family to send a strong man to guard the city; - Jiangyin City was originally very small, only about 10,000 households and 1,000 soldiers. In this way, there were tens of thousands of people watching on the city head, and the rest of the old and weak were responsible for transporting supplies to do rear work. He also moved all the gunpowder and firearms stored in the county to the four city towers and distributed them properly. But at this time, the military pay became a problem, so Yingyuan gathered all the rich households in the city and tried to persuade them to donate. He said: "Everyone doesn't have to take money; rice, cloth, wine, meat, equipment, take whatever you have, you must know that this is not the time to seek peace; but if you can defend the county seat for one more day, we will enjoy one more day of freedom, and be a loyal minister and righteous man of the Ming Dynasty for one day; once the Tartars enter the city, do you still want to be a rich man steadily? Don't dream everyone! The Imperial College student Cheng Bi heard it and first donated 15,000 taels of silver, which stirred everyone, so they all enthusiastically donated, and soon they got 300 jars of gunpowder, 1,000 stones of lead pellets and iron bullets, 100 cannons, and 1,000 muskets; The rest of the food, wine, meat, horse grass,…… were also piled up like mountains.</p>
<p>Since supplies were not a problem, they began to distribute duties: Wu Ju Huang Lue guarded the east gate, Chen Mingxuan guarded the west gate, Yingyuan himself guarded the north gate, and a battalion commander guarded the south gate. And Yingyuan took care of the four gates, and Lai Zhu patrolled. At this time, the troops of Prince Duo had already reached Jiangyin County, and the number of troops was no less than 100,000, surrounding a small county several times, with endless camps outside the city, really covering the sky with flags and connecting the camps with armor, which was very scary.</p>
<p>The war was launched, first the arrows were shot into the city from outside the city, like locusts, buzzing non-stop in the ears. The city was not weak, and the number of deaths on both sides was not very high; the besieging soldiers saw that the inside was well prepared, so they had to use artillery to attack the city: how could a small city wall withstand a concentrated attack? Soon, there was a loud boom, and it turned out that there was a big crack in the city wall; the besieging soldiers climbed up like ants, and everyone was panicked, only Yingyuan calmly ordered to quickly pick up the door panels of nearby houses and string them together with ropes, first blocking the cracks, so that the soldiers outside could not enter, and then concentrated all the empty coffins in the coffin shops in the city, filled them with soil, and blocked them in the gaps, so that even the artillery fire was ineffective. The soldiers outside were so angry that their eyes were red, and they concentrated their artillery fire again. Sure enough, in less than half a day, they attacked a big hole in the north city, but fortunately the enemy soldiers did not have time to come, Yingyuan had ordered everyone in the city to transport stones to block the hole overnight. He said that everyone, regardless of size, old or weak, must transport a stone, this method was very effective, everyone was reluctant to lag behind, and in a moment the city had been repaired, and when the enemy soldiers approached the city, it was still a good city, and they were secretly surprised.</p>
<p>After supporting for more than ten days, the arrows in the city gradually became scarce; Yan Yingyuan suddenly thought of the story of "borrowing arrows with grass boats", and thought: "Why don't I make it the same way?" It happened that it was the waning moon (after the 20th of the lunar calendar), and the moon did not come out until the second half of the night. He ordered people to tie rice straw into people, with a lantern hanging in the middle of ten straw people, and in the hazy night, they lowered the straw people outside the city. The soldiers on the city head shouted together, and the people outside the city heard it and thought that the people in the city were going to rob the camp, panicked, and could not help but shoot arrows. After releasing it for half a day without seeing any movement, they stopped, and it was not until dawn that they knew that they had been deceived. Yingyuan got tens of thousands of arrows in one breath, and he was indescribably happy. He also sent many strong men out of the city to rob the camp this night. Those Qing soldiers, who had already been deceived once, were naturally no longer prepared, and they made a lot of noise for half the night. Who didn't want to sleep? But they didn't expect that in the middle of the night, fires suddenly broke out on all sides, and the desperate shouts made everyone's hearts beat faster. In the darkness, they only ran out for their lives. In this way, not only were they killed, but there were also several thousand people who were trampled to death! They retreated three miles before stopping!</p>
<p>The commander of the Qing army was Liu Liangzuo, a Han Chinese. As mentioned earlier, he was one of the four garrisons of the Prince of Fu, ordered to guard the Fengshou area (now Anhui), but he did not expect the Qing army to go south, and he was the first to welcome and surrender. Now he turned his back on the enemy and killed his compatriots. Since he had found out that the defending general in the city was Yan Yingyuan, he wanted to use the pros and cons to persuade him to surrender. He estimated that Yan Yingyuan was just a Records Keeper, as long as he used the future position as an lure, there would be no problem. So he rode his horse to the city and shouted, "General Liu is here, he is an old friend of Records Keeper Yan, please Records Keeper Yan come to the city to talk." Yingyuan stood on the city head and knew his intentions at a glance; he scolded loudly: 'General Liu, you recognize the thief as your father, what else is there to say now?' Liangzuo said below: 'Records Keeper Yan, those who know current affairs are outstanding people, Hongguang Emperor (that is, the Prince of Fu) is finished, and the entire Jiangnan will soon become the territory of the Qing Dynasty, the general trend is gone, why should you be so stubborn in this small city? If you are willing to surrender, I am willing to guarantee your future wealth with my life!' Yingyuan was so angry that he glared his eyes and scolded: 'Hongguang Emperor ordered you to guard Jiangbei and sealed you as the Earl of Guangchang, you have treated you very well; you heartless traitor, you are not enough to be a Han traitor yourself, do you still want to pull me, Yan? You must know that although I am a small Records Keeper, I know what a country is and what loyalty is, and I don't want to just seek immediate wealth and fall into being scolded as a traitor for thousands of years! It is a pity that you were once a minister of the Ming Dynasty, but now you are leading the wolf into the house, selling the country for glory, you look in the mirror, what face do you have to see the loyal ministers and righteous men of our Jiangyin County!" Liu Liangzuo couldn't answer half a word, his face full of shame, and he returned dejectedly.</p>
<p>The situation became more and more serious, because the Qing army had increased reinforcements, and at this time, along the Yangtze River, only this county was still stubbornly resisting. Suzhou and Songjiang had already been captured, and the troops from all over were concentrated here. At first, they used gentle methods, hoping that the city would surrender. One day, they tied up two Ming generals who had surrendered and knelt them down to persuade Yingyuan to give in. These two things, while shedding shameless tears, said shamelessly: "The Qing army is powerful, you are just making a fuss blindly; why hit a stone with an egg? You see, we are not willing to sell the country, the situation has come to this point, it is really impossible to make meaningless sacrifices! Think about it!……' It made Yingyuan very angry and scolded loudly: "You cowardly bastards! If you lose the battle, you should find a happy way to die, just keep talking nonsense in front of me! Without you shameful things, the Ming Dynasty would not have died so quickly! Are you not ashamed!" Then he shouted, 'Soldiers guarding the city, hurry up and shoot these two shameless slaves of the country to death', the Qing soldiers quickly rushed to protect them, and one had already been shot to death, so they had to hold them away.</p>
<p>Later, someone sent a message saying, "As long as Yingyuan is willing to kill a few of the first initiators of the resistance in the city, the troops can be withdrawn, and both sides will look good!" Yingyuan said: "The first one to initiate the rebellion was me, if you have the ability, kill my head, nothing else can be discussed! Since you have come, let me formally tell you, convey it to your prince, all the people of Jiangyin are only prepared to use "death" to deal with him, tell him not to have any more extravagant hopes, if you have the ability, just fight!" The messenger ran back in a panic.</p>
<p>The time had come to the Mid-Autumn Festival, and it had been almost three months since the city was besieged in the summer. It was a small city, but it was still the world of the Ming Dynasty. Even if there were strong enemies outside, on this reunion festival, wouldn't it also give people a kind of comfort in the tragedy? Yingyuan usually loved the soldiers extremely, personally applied medicine to the wounded, and personally cried and dressed the dead, plus a patriotic enthusiasm, who would not be grateful to him, love him, and even be influenced by him? On this day, everyone had an unspeakable sadness and joy, and Yingyuan also secretly felt some joy. He distributed wine and meat to the soldiers guarding the city, and also gave reward money, and ordered everyone to enjoy the moon on the city head at night; everyone was so happy that they were crazy: the sun went down, and a crystal clear and cold moon rose from the sea, shining on the Yangtze River, shining on the enemy's thousands of camps outside the city, shining on the edge of the spears, shining on the hearts of everyone who was prepared to sacrifice, this was such a solemn and beautiful night scene. Everyone couldn't help but drink to their heart's content, and after a while, someone sang the sobbing and sad five-watch tune (this was a new military song compiled by Xu Yongde), echoing the wailing sound of the military trumpets and the whispers of some guarding soldiers, this tragic banquet: this symphony of crying and laughing, was also the last happy day of Jiangyin City!</p>
<p>The attacking soldiers heard this tragic singing and scouted the situation in the city, and knew that there was no intention to surrender, so they decided to issue the final attack order: the soldiers were all wearing exquisite iron armor, carrying sharp knives and axes, and climbed up the city at the risk of their lives. The soldiers guarding the city also resisted desperately, and when the knives and guns were chopped on the iron armor, there was only a clanging sound, and the blades were all broken. The artillery fire was even more mercilessly shot, the smoke was filled, and it was impossible to distinguish between the near and far, from morning to night, I don't know how many enemy soldiers and how many soldiers guarding the city were killed, corpses were everywhere, and sobbing cries were heard in all the streets and alleys. Yan Yingyuan saw it, and only with sad tears in his eyes, made the last struggle on the city head, and managed to maintain it for one day and one night; the next morning, the weather was gloomy and gray, as if showing the arrival of a bad fate, and soon, a heavy rain fell. The raindrops hit everyone's faces, falling like tears, and the sound of artillery outside the city sounded again, it seemed to be denser than yesterday, and people attacked like ants in the rain; Yingyuan braved the rain, took the sword, and inspected the four cities. Everyone's eyes were red, and they were cutting down enemies like crazy, and they were also cut down by crazy enemies. The shouting was like bursts of thunder, mixed with the sound of the rain, it was simply indistinguishable. This tense situation lasted until noon, the rain was still falling, but the enemies were killing more and more, and the artillery fire was even denser. Suddenly, boom! Boom! A few strange noises that shook the ears, a fiery red flame, flew from the earth bridge outside the city, and then there was a sound of collapsing bricks and stones, and the west city collapsed! The enemy soldiers rushed in like flowing water, and although the soldiers guarding the city tried their best to resist, after a day and a night of fierce fighting, they were really exhausted, and they were killed one by one by the enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>In this way, Jiangyin City, which had been defended for eighty-one days, fell in a tragic sacrifice.</p>
<p>The city became a scene of smoke, a sea of blood, and a scream of crying! Yan Yingyuan still had about a hundred people left. He rode a horse, went left and right, and fought the enemy in street battles. It is said that he killed no less than a thousand people, and he wanted to break through a way to rush to the city gate. After running out, he set up another method; but when he arrived near the city gate, it had already been tightly sealed, and it was difficult to escape. He got off his horse and ran straight to Qianhu Lake, wanting to jump down, but Liu Liangzuo saw that he was very talented and wanted to capture him alive, so before he could jump into the water, he was hugged and sent to Liu Liangzuo's camp.</p>
<p>Liu Liangzuo was stationed in the Qianming Buddhist Hall in the city, and the soldiers escorted Yan Yingyuan in. He was sitting arrogantly in the hall, but when he first saw Yingyuan, he didn't know what kind of power it was, but it made him walk down immediately, and he couldn't help but embrace Yingyuan and cry loudly! When Yingyuan saw his appearance, he only gave a contemptuous smile: "Okay, I have finally been captured by you, I don't ask for anything else, just die quickly! Heroes are not afraid of death; what are you crying for?" Liangzuo took him to see the prince, wanting to say a few words for him, but Yingyuan was very stubborn and refused to kneel, just glared his eyes and glared; a guard next to him saw it and stabbed him with a gun, hitting Yingyuan's leg bone, and he fell to the ground immediately! At this time, it was dusk, and the dark clouds were even thicker. A few guards took Yingyuan straight to Qixia Chan Temple, and later no one saw this patriotic hero again.</p>
<p>Afterwards, someone heard the old monk of Qixia Chan Temple say that that night, he only heard the sound of flapping and a sharp cry, saying: "Just kill me! You barbaric things!" After such a tragic cry until the next morning, it became quiet and there was no other sound.</p>
<p>As for Chen Mingxuan, someone saw his body standing stiffly in the corner of the wall of the Bingbeidao Yamen, his eyeballs protruding, full of red and green, and he was still holding a knife in his hand, and the ground was covered with blood.</p>
<p>After all, this small Jiangyin City supported for eighty-one days! It is said that the besieging army had as many as 240,000 people, and more than 70,000 died, and 50,000 or 60,000 soldiers in the city also died. There were only corpses and flesh and blood on the streets, and almost no living people.</p>
<p>Three hundred years later, do people still know this tragic drama? Can anyone still perform such a drama? (End)</p>

<p>Shrimp Tails Remain Low in Volume, Market Expected to Rise: Currently, the various sources are not abundantly supplying, but the customer base's business has already settled, so even though goods from other provinces are scarce, there is still enough supply. It is reported that prices are frequently rising in various producing areas, so although trading in this city is sparse, the fundamentals are extremely solid. Yesterday, 14 cases of Moto Higashi shrimp tails arrived from Kobe. The listed price was $110 for large, high-quality goods with bright color; $90.80 for discolored, slightly shriveled goods. All were sold through. Other goods were offered around, but few were bought. Golden Hook tails were $107, Annam Tan tails were $105 to $100, American San Francisco tails with good body color were $130, and mixed goods were $120 to $115. Domestic Yantai large-sized dried shrimp tails were $85, medium-sized were $70, Wenzhou medium-sized were $78, Jiangbei medium-sized were $64, Chaozhou body were $54, small-sized were $35, Si tail heads were $30, and mixed hand-picked were $25-26. Singapore Long Tooth tails, screened clean, were $60, and original packages were $45 to $40. Singapore Xiangshan tails were $72 to $65. However, the inventory of all the above goods is low. If customer sales become brisk, it is feared that the supply will be insufficient.</p>
<p>Sharp Decline in Imported Western Sea Cucumber: Due to poor production of foreign sea cucumber in recent years, imports have been decreasing daily. The shortage is even greater this spring, and prices at various dealers have continued to rise. Yesterday evening, the listed price for 8-piece Golden Mountain Red Bottom Boot sea cucumber was $240, 4-piece Plum Blossom sea cucumber was $252, 2-3 piece Makassar Plum Blossom sea cucumber was $225, 4-piece was $208, 5-piece was $185, 8-piece was $168, 10-piece was $154, 4-piece Duck Pier Plum Blossom sea cucumber was $150, 6-8 piece was $135, 6-piece Makassar Fan Wu sea cucumber was $215, 8-piece was $205, 10-piece was $195, 12-piece was $180, 15-piece was $168, 18-piece was $140, 22-piece was $121, 3-piece White Rock sea cucumber was $165, and 4-piece was $153.50. Dealers are showing strong interest, and the market situation is exceptionally agile, it is said.</p>

<p>Over 20,000 Bags of German Coarse Granulated White Sugar Imported:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend was stable, but transactions remained sluggish. The guild listed spot prices for 24 coarse granulated white sugar at $22 and transit goods at $6.95. Other East Red White and local factory cotton white sugars were quoted at original prices without change. For domestic Chaozhou Green sugar, dealers' interest is gradually increasing. Although the Shantou exchange rate rose to $1,175 yesterday, sugar prices also rose accordingly, making it difficult to coordinate bids. Therefore, dealers decided not to seek distant supplies but to purchase locally in Shanghai, which is more appropriate. Yesterday, 500 packages of Huanggang Green sugar were offered at $10.50, over 200 packages of Father Gao Reduced Green sugar at $9.80, and over 200 packages of Branch Red sugar at $12.70 to $12.60, settling at $12.60 to bid for $12.50. A ship from Java arrived with 20,484 bags of German coarse granulated white sugar, which were unloaded at the Gonghexiang warehouse.</p>
<p>The Jingye Cooperative Company held its bidding exchange yesterday. Bidding prices were the same as before, but transactions were limited. The total quota was 4,705 pieces, but only 90 packages were sold: 20 packages of Five Sheep coarse white Guangzhou goods at $21.85, 20 packages of Quxi goods at $21.65, and 60 packages of No. 4 cotton white at $20.90. There were no other transactions.</p>

<p>Fresh Sichuan pickled mustard tubers are now available. The first batch of Kuangxi tubers, 300-400 loads, were offered at $22.50, and sold at $22.50. Transactions on this street are still good. Around 300 pieces of fresh Peiling tubers have also arrived but have not yet been offered. It is said that this year's production is very scarce because merchants have not been able to make profits in recent years. In addition, the water level in Sichuan is currently low, and shipping fees are high, so costs are difficult to reduce. The trend is quite tight. Yesterday, old goods were also sold at $20 to $18-19, another increase of $2-3 from before, it is said.</p>

<p>Over 900 crates of Wild Chicken thin iron were loaded and arrived at the Huishan Wharf and New Taikoo warehouses yesterday, increasing the circulation of goods on the market.

<p>Yesterday's woolen fabric transactions showed progress as the weather turned warmer. Sales of spring light wool flannel and summer goods were very strong. However, sales of dark green woolen fabrics have sharply declined in Shanghai. Dark green Hessling flannel and Guangmao flannel in stock at various woolen fabric stores have little outlet and are willing to sell at low prices. Most women's colored goods are trending towards camel colors, and long green is also showing signs of stagnation. It is worth noting that the vogue for dark green woolen fabrics has only lasted two years. However, there is still demand for these woolen fabrics in other cities, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e207">Celebrating a Birthday by Buying Airplanes vs. Sending Telegrams <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>For Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday this year, people from all walks of life have launched initiatives, contributing funds according to their economic capacity, to purchase airplanes as a birthday gift. This is both to express love and support for the leader and to promote the consolidation of national defense. All of our citizens should do this.</p>
<p>However, the value of one airplane is always over tens of thousands of dollars, which is beyond the economic capacity of the average individual. It requires the combined efforts of many people. But we, for the national leader, besides expressing our sentiments as a group when the time comes, we must have individual expressions. There are many ways to express it, and the most economical, most emotional, and most fashionable is to send a congratulatory telegram for his birthday.</p>
<p>The practice of sending telegrams for birthday celebrations has foreign precedents: the birthday of President Wilson of the United States the year before last, and the birthday of King George of England last year. British and American people, no matter how far or near, all sent telegrams to express their celebrations. At that time, the telegraph offices worked overtime and were extremely busy! This is because telegrams are concise and quick, solemn and dignified, suitable for individuals and also suitable for groups.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang's birthday is approaching. All of our national citizens, those who have already contributed to buy airplanes, must send telegrams to express their respect before the airplanes arrive. Those who have not contributed to buy airplanes, must send telegrams to express their respect before deciding on what gift to give. Buying airplanes and sending telegrams can be done simultaneously, or they can be done separately. They can be prepared in advance, or they can be handled temporarily.</p>
<p>We believe that this airplane purchase will have amazing results, and we truly believe that this telegram campaign will have an unprecedented scale. Only in this way can it show that our party is a party with a leader, and that our country is a modern country.</p>
<h3 id="e208">The Issue of Self-Sufficiency in Electrical Materials <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Most of the various materials used in telegraphs and telephones in our country are imported, and the amount of money lost each year is considerable. Mr. Baozhen's article "Discussion on Domestic Electrical Materials" in the 54th issue of this publication had a very detailed discussion, which readers may still remember. The reporter feels that if the issue of self-sufficiency in electrical materials cannot be resolved one day, not only will the outflow of money never stop, but the international threat will also have no way to be lifted. In the current extraordinary period, we seem to need to work together to conduct a thorough study of this issue in order to find an appropriate solution. The reporter respectfully offers a few humble opinions in the hope that readers will provide guidance.</p>
<p>The easiest and most common electrical material to manufacture is all kinds of printed paper. The telegraph office uses a large amount of newspaper, transfer newspaper, return newspaper, posted newspaper, public telegram paper, receipts, telegram envelopes, and various other printed materials every year. These papers can all be used if we adopt domestic products. Moreover, the government has long issued a clear order to adopt domestic paper. But in reality, the opposite is true. Originally, the paper for various printed materials was purchased by the printing houses. Although the government stipulates that domestic paper must be used, printing houses often seek greater profits from foreign paper and continue to disobey in secret. People who purchase printed materials are not experts and naturally cannot distinguish whether it is domestic paper. Therefore, in reality, although the government promotes domestic products with repeated orders, domestic products remain unsold. Regarding this point, we believe that if paper mills and printing industries have close connections and implement production and sales cooperation, the problem of supplying domestic paper will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Secondly, the telegraph office uses blue and white paper strips and parchment paper strips. The annual consumption is also considerable. Currently, almost all are ordered from abroad. If supply problems occur, what impact will it have on telecommunications! The manufacturing of the above paper strips is not very difficult. The reporter knows that a paper mill in Shanghai once contacted the Ministry of Communications to contract for the manufacture of these paper strips, but later it did not succeed because the price difference was too great. Originally, foreign paper strips were produced in large quantities, so the selling price was extremely low, and domestic manufacturers naturally could not compete with them. They had to let foreign goods exclusively dominate the domestic market, which is the most painful thing. The reporter hopes that domestic paper manufacturers can cooperate with the government to find ways to achieve self-sufficiency in the above paper strips. I think this matter is beneficial to all parties and will definitely proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Finally, we must talk about the various machines used by the telegraph office. As far as the reporter knows, we can now produce non-cash telegrams and power machines domestically. However, various metal raw materials still have to rely on foreign imports. How to achieve self-sufficiency in metal raw materials is an urgent problem to be solved today. But this matter is of great importance and must rely on the power of the government, gathering ideas and benefiting from each other, to have hope of a solution. It is said that the government is paying close attention to this matter and is proceeding with it step by step. I hope that domestic metallurgists and entrepreneurs will contribute their talents to support the government.</p>
<p>Our country's foreign trade has always been in deficit for many years, but according to recent reports, there was a surplus of over 5 million in December of last year, and a surplus of over 1 million in January of this year. The future seems optimistic, but when we examine the reasons for the surplus, we will immediately feel that this phenomenon is temporary. First: the trend of tax evasion in North China is very strong, and these goods account for a large number of imports. Second: the largest number of exports is tung oil, which is said to be the result of the Italian-Ethiopian War and world war preparations, which will decline when the situation eases. At the same time, when we examine the imported goods, they are all industrial products. Therefore, to balance our country's foreign trade, we must vigorously promote domestic industry, and self-sufficiency in electrical materials is just one aspect of domestic industry!</p>
<h3 id="e209">A Discussion on the Method of Installing Private Long-Distance Telephone Lines <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Gong</p>
<p>Many large factories or local product purchasers often set up factories or purchasing offices in the production areas of raw materials or local products for the convenience of purchasing raw materials or collecting local products. However, the telecommunications of the above places may not have been completed, or even if a telegraph office has been established, the distance is too far, and it takes time to travel back and forth, which is not without its shortcomings! In view of this, the Ministry of Communications promulgated temporary measures for the installation of commercial telegram private lines in March of the year before last, the purpose of which is to facilitate the use of merchants to transmit telegrams. 'However, these measures are limited to the telegram aspect. Recently, in order to make it convenient for merchants and factories that are far from the telegraph office or do not have city telephones to send and receive long-distance telephones, there has been the announcement of the installation of private long-distance telephone lines, which has been implemented since April 1. Here, the main points of the measures are summarized for reference.</p>
<p>Those who request the installation of this private line should open their names, occupations and detailed addresses, and apply to the nearest telegraph office or telephone business office. After accepting the request, the office will estimate the amount of labor and material costs required and report it to the local telecommunications administration for approval. After approval, the applicant should immediately pay off the approved labor and materials at one time, and deposit a deposit of 20 yuan, so that the office can send workers to install.</p>
<p>For those who jointly request the installation of a private line from several users in the same area at the same time, all line labor and material costs shall be shared by the households according to the distance of the line. Users may also provide their own machinery and materials, fill out an application form, and request the bureau to send workers to install. In addition to the deposit, the engineering fee shall also be borne by the installation household, and the machinery and material fee shall be exempted. After this private line is installed, all the sales and lines paid, except for the telephone installed by the user and the deposit paid by the user, shall be owned by the Ministry of Communications and shall not be refunded.</p>
<p>The installer shall still pay the special power fee and call fee for outgoing calls in accordance with the regulations, and shall also pay a monthly private line maintenance fee, which shall be calculated according to the length of the line, one yuan per kilometer per month, and those less than one kilometer shall also be calculated according to kilometers. As for the incoming call special power fee for private line installers, it can be exempted from payment. In the same area, installers who connect to each other by five households shall be charged an additional exchange fee of one yuan per month per household, and those with more than fifteen households shall be charged an additional exchange fee of three yuan per month per household. When there are more than 50 households, the Ministry of Communications may change it to a city telephone depending on the situation.</p>
<p>The installer shall pay the daily long-distance telephone fee within five days. If there is any arrears, the telegraph office may deduct the amount from the deposit and stop connecting to incoming and outgoing long-distance telephones. If the suspension of the connection has exceeded seven days, and the deposit is not replenished, the telephone will be removed, and the remaining arrears must still be recovered. When the installer removes the machine, the deposit paid shall be collected from the office with the deposit receipt within five days to three months after the removal of the machine, and will not be returned after the expiration date; if the installer loses the receipt, he shall find a solid shop to guarantee and issue a guarantee, and the office shall verify that it is true before it can be issued. Also, if there is any damage or loss of parts when the machine is removed, compensation shall be paid at the original price.</p>
<p>Before the above measures were announced, although there were installers of long-distance telephone private lines, they were all temporarily negotiated and the measures were different. Now that uniform measures are stipulated, it will be more convenient to apply for a private line in the future. These measures enable those who send and receive long-distance calls to talk with people in remote areas in one room without leaving their homes, and can save a lot of special power fees, which is both time-saving and economical. It is hoped that those who need it will install and use it quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Types of Telephones <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Baozhen</p>
<p>The words or sentences used in telegrams are called telegraphic language. Its types can be divided into the following four types:</p>
<p>Chinese Plain Language: According to Article 53 of the Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations, Chinese plain language is written in Chinese characters, and its meaning is clear and consistent, without the need for explanation. When translating this plain language into telegraphic code, it should be translated according to the plain code in the newly compiled plain and cipher code published by the Ministry of Communications. The telegram text of Chinese plain language telegrams should be written entirely in Chinese plain language in accordance with the regulations. However, in the following circumstances, fees are still calculated according to the Chinese plain language price: (A) door numbers and various numbers written in Arabic numerals, without secret meanings; (B) cipher code numbers added at the beginning or end of telegram texts from banks or money changers and Arabic numerals indicating the date of sending the telegram; (C) business logos, such as Red Blue Car flour; (D) telegram registered wordings (used in the telegram text or as the sender's signature, limited to cases where the context is sufficient to prove that it is indeed a registered wording); (E) date and time code published in the newly compiled code, such as 99r6 9809, or characters representing the date rhyme, such as 銑諫. Also, the telegram text of Chinese plain language telegrams should not be too brief, such as "Rain damage Da oranges reduce clothing out," so that the meaning is obscure and difficult to understand. As for industry secret codes or business terms, such as "Quickly exchange Shen Guang Qian" and "Xie Wang pick sharp pass five," the words Guang and Xie Wang pick sharp pass are not understood or interpreted by the general public. Therefore, telegram texts that are too brief, obscure, or written in secret code should still be charged as Chinese cipher telegrams in accordance with the regulations. But dialects and colloquialisms without secret meanings, such as "I see Qiao," can be considered plain language. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e211">Common Sense that Telephone Users Should Have <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Linsheng</p>
<p>Common sense is, of course, very common knowledge! Do people who use the telephone not know this, and must I explain it? However, knowledge is something that is learned and learned endlessly, and it is easier to ignore it when it comes to the ordinary. Therefore, we have specifically listed the "Common Sense that Telephone Users Should Have" for the users to listen to:</p>
<p>The location where the telephone is installed is, in principle, designated by the user. However, telephones cannot be installed in the following types of places, or must be moved if they are installed:</p>
<p>A. Places that are likely to be invaded by rain and snow, or are too humid, which can damage the telephone and hinder listening.</p>
<p>B. Places that are close to electric light money roads or stoves and are prone to danger.</p>
<p>C. The halls, corridors, and passages of houses with more than several households, which can easily damage the telephone and cause users to feel lost.</p>
<p>All business users—such as stores—or places with a large number of public entries and exits—such as hotels—should add a wooden box outside the telephone—a rectangular shape that is slightly larger than the telephone, with large holes on the side, so that the microphone and receiver can be hung outside. If necessary, it can be locked to prevent theft of the telephone or parts of it. Residential telephones should not be installed too far away from the bedroom. Because in this way, there is the trouble of not being able to be called in time during the day, and there is the disadvantage of not being able to come for a long time at night, which can delay important matters. (Generally, residential installers will not give him a telephone at night unless there is an important matter.)</p>
<p>Telephones must not be played with by children. The receiver (commonly known as the earpiece) of a common telephone and the dial of an automatic telephone must not be taken off and hung up (the former) or dialed around (the latter), because this is not only a risk of damaging the equipment, but also enough to hinder the credit of the required number.</p>
<p>Telephone calls should preferably be made by the owner or mistress in person (this refers specifically to residences, stores are not included). When it is unavoidable, do not use servants. Even small things such as inviting guests and entertaining should be done by the person himself, which can not only show respect but also avoid being blinded by others.</p>
<p>During thunderstorms and heavy rain, it is best not to make phone calls. When it is necessary to talk, be careful to avoid touching metal parts to avoid danger.</p>
<p>When a fire is far away, there is no need to ask the telegraph office for more information. At this time, the exchange in the telegraph office is in an extremely busy period, and asking will not get a satisfactory answer. This is a forgiveness that should be given in terms of public morality and in fact. When a fire is nearby, you should call the fire department to warn them, but when you call your relatives and friends, do not exaggerate the story unless it is extremely dangerous, so as not to cause concern.</p>
<p>Although there is no time limit for city telephones, the conversation should be simple and not too long, to prevent others from having an urgent call with you.</p>
<p>It is advisable to keep a small booklet next to the telephone, with a pencil attached. If the person is not there, when someone else answers the phone, the words received can be recorded on it in simple sentences to avoid forgetting.</p>
<p>All commonly used user numbers should be filled in a table and pasted next to the telephone for easy lookup.</p>
<p>Of course, there are more things that installers should pay attention to than the ten items mentioned above, but some seem too trivial, and some are too troublesome. Due to time constraints, we will not report them one by one here.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Q &amp; A <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>This publication has specially opened a question and answer column. Members of the public are welcome to ask questions about the procedures for sending and receiving telegrams and telephones, or about unclear parts of the telecommunications regulations, or about telecommunications common sense. This publication will be happy to answer.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shoushen from Jiaxing asks: The long-distance call between Jiaxing and Shengze is very close, but when both parties talk, the problem of sometimes clear and sometimes blurred often occurs. May I ask if this is a mechanical obstruction or improper connection.</p>
<p>(Answer) Although the distance between Jiaxing and Shengze is close, the Ministry of Communications and the Zhejiang Provincial Telegraph Office have agreed that Pingwang in Jiangsu Province will be the transfer office. Therefore, the long-distance telephone from Jiaxing to Shengze first connects to Pingwang via Tiehua Qian, and then connects to Wangjiangjing via a single root of Tie Qian, and then transfers to Shengze. The sound is difficult to hear clearly due to the number of transfers in the middle, and the fact that it is a Tie Qian line. It is now heard that the Ministry of Communications is trying to improve it, and will change Shengze to a transfer office in Jiangsu Province. In the future, the long-distance telephone between Jiaxing and Shengze can be improved from before.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Cheng from Shanghai asks: If a military agency sends a cipher telegram to a certain military officer using telegram paper, assuming that the explicit code says "To Commander Yu of the 17th Army of the Hankou Army," how many words should these twelve words be calculated?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to the schedule in Article 83 of the Domestic Telegraph Business Regulations: official military telegrams, regardless of the type of telegram, the address and name are charged according to the original number of words. The name of the addressee of the telegram should be charged twelve words.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Zhu Guangqian to Zhu Guangshan <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Guangqian</p>
<p>——For "Thirteen Letters to Youth"</p>
<p>Mr. Guangshan,</p>
<p>Today I received a book from a friend in Shanghai, and opening it, I was quite surprised. The cover was titled "To Youth," by "Zhu Guangqian," with the added note "Thirteen Letters to Youth." At first glance, I mistook the "澘" in your name for "潛." I don't know if it was an illusion or vanity, but I unthinkingly mistook your great work for my own, which I hope you will forgive. First, "Zhu Guangshan" and "Zhu Guangqian" are indeed very similar in writing. Second, I, named "Zhu Guangqian," also wrote a small book called "Twelve Letters to Youth," and my "On Beauty" was also subtitled "Thirteenth Letter to Youth" on the cover by the bookstore. Third, the cover designs of your great work and my humble work are also roughly the same, both with stars embedded in some straight lines. You can imagine why I made the mistake, and I was not the only one. The friend who sent me your great work initially mistook you for me as well. He said in his letter, "I flipped through the book back and forth at the bookstore, and the more I looked, the less it seemed like something you would write, so I bought it for you to see." He added a disrespectful remark, which I won't quote. You see, he flipped through the book "back and forth" at the bookstore, and only "the more he looked" did he realize "it didn't seem like something I would write." He knows me, but those who don't know me might be even more forgiven for not realizing that your great work was not written by me.</p>
<p>Mr. Guangshan, I don't know you, but because of the coincidental reasons mentioned above, your appearance, words, actions, demeanor, and personality have aroused a great deal of curiosity in me. I want to imagine what kind of person you are. It's often better not to reveal everything, so I hope you'll always keep a bit of mysteriousness in my mind. But I also want to tell you what's on my mind. It seems a bit presumptuous to write to you without knowing you. Please remember that I am one of your readers. If that qualification isn't enough, then you can only blame yourself for being named Zhu Guangshan and for writing "Thirteen Letters to Youth"!</p>
<p>First of all, I should confess to you. When I wrote "Twelve Letters to Youth," I was still a youth myself. At that time, my friend Mr. Xia Gaizun ran a publication for middle school students called "General," and he asked me to write some articles. So I wrote whatever I felt at the moment and sent it to him in the form of letters. Some of it was indeed written for middle school students, but most of it was personal and heartfelt feelings. I wrote from the bottom of my heart, and I had absolutely no intention of "teaching" anyone, let alone thinking of using these debut works to show off or earn稿費. I simply don't believe that anyone can claim the position of "advanced" to "guide" young people, and be able to "guide" them well. From my own experience, what I benefited most from in my youth was not the stern lectures of teachers and elders, but the honest self-disclosures of my young friends about their own internal conflicts, struggles, doubts, and beliefs. These disclosures aroused my sympathy, confirmation, emotion, and recollection. I was constantly stimulated by such spiritual agitation, and thus constantly achieved spiritual development. From this, I deeply felt that Rousseau's words in "Emile" that the ages of the tutor and the student should be similar contain great wisdom. Only when you are a youth yourself can you truly be friends with young people, can you both feel like you are part of the same group, whether it's sweet or bitter, everyone can understand each other, sympathize with each other, and thus learn from and inspire each other. Now, when I see my old "Twelve Letters to Youth," I feel really ashamed. I think every adult feels some shame when they recall the naivety and foolishness of their childhood. But it is precisely because of that frank exposure of naivety and foolishness that my little book won the love of young people. I was originally one of them, my sorrows and my joys were also their sorrows and their joys. I poured out my heart to them, and they felt sympathy and empathy with me. Whether this was beneficial or harmful to them, neither they nor I particularly cared about. My relationship with young people was originally just like this. Later, that little book became very popular, and I became known to many people I didn't even know as the author of "Twelve Letters to Youth." Even now, when I meet new friends, I am often introduced with this title. They even use words like "guiding young people" to praise me. Sometimes I not only feel ashamed about this, but also very indignant. I originally hated the topic of "guiding young people," but now I am actually being labeled with "guiding young people," is this the reward or punishment for frankly exposing naivety and foolishness?</p>
<p>Mr. Guangshan, haven't you guarded against this precedent? Not to mention anything else, aren't you afraid of the danger of "following in the footsteps"? Because I'm pressed for time, I haven't read your great work carefully from beginning to end, I've just flipped through it here and there. I also have a little bit of feeling. First of all, I admire your frankness. You call yourself a "young writer," an "advanced person," someone who has had "at least ten years of literary addiction," who has "tasted a lot of pain and hit a lot of nails." You cite the example of "revolutionary youth in the political department and the army, most of whom love literature" to make a judgment that "saying that those who devote themselves to literature are weak and useless is absurd in the extreme," a "cast-iron proof." You admit – here I copy a passage from you to avoid taking things out of context: "I observe that many young people nowadays do indeed have a kind of 'publishing mania'! ... Most young people only wonder why the articles that get published are always by those few famous people, and why their own don't get published. They don't consider how good other people's works are, or how good their own works are. This is a morbid mentality of the average young literature enthusiast in modern times. I deeply feel that I often have this morbid mentality. I can even assert that you may not be without this mentality either. The end point of this mentality is to cultivate a desire to 'show off' and 'get稿費,' without the heart to explore literature. How dangerous this is!"</p>
<p>I think your words are all correct. Secondly, I admire your confidence. You advise people to "not publish their own works until they are perfectly sound." Now, the ones you have published are, of course, "perfectly sound." You "believe that you have only received a not-very-profound education, but you are still able to write one or two not-completely-incoherent articles, and the foundation is still based on a few important transformative reading processes." Sir, did you think this through when you wrote these sentences? Many of the lessons you give to young people are very interesting, but the most remarkable thing is that when you get to the crucial point, you just slip past it lightly. Here are three examples:</p>
<p>"Youthful love is necessary, but if it is too 'urgent' or too 'hasty,' it will lead to boredom, and that's just asking for trouble."</p>
<p>"Reading should be interesting. If you think of it as forced labor, then it's all over. Interest is the first priority. Even when reading the most boring墨 philosophy, you should treat it as something interesting."</p>
<p>"Those who want to write often have a sudden surge of inspiration and a strong desire to write something, but when they pick up the pen, they can't write a single word and have to sit down dejectedly. ... Boldly speaking, every young writer must experience this kind of frustration when they start writing. Therefore, writing methods arise like a storm in response to the need."</p>
<p>This kind of tone can be seen in every article in your great work. In your letter to "Fen," the opening sentence is:</p>
<p>"The first letter has just been sent, and the second letter is following closely. Because I know that when you receive the first letter, you will definitely feel that what I said is right."</p>
<p>The closing sentence is: "Outside the curtain, the rain is drizzling, and the spring is brilliant. I miss you very much! Fen."</p>
<p>When I saw these places, my first impulse was to say something sarcastic, but I lack a sense of humor, and this impulse was immediately overwhelmed by a sense of "concern for the state of the world and people's hearts." In the first letter "To Young Writers," you said: "If you want to use 'literature' as a dazzling title, or want to use 'literature' to make a living, then it becomes a serious morbid state."</p>
<p>This "serious morbid state," Mr. Guangshan, you may have to admit, seems to be very prevalent in the Chinese literary world right now. What to do? I originally wanted to make some comments on this "serious morbid state," but then I thought that this matter could not be resolved by "words," so I put down my pen, although I still felt a little lost, unable to let this matter go lightly.</p>
<p>Almost your namesake, Zhu Guangqian.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Eighth Anniversary of Bogdanov's Death <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Shune</p>
<p>It is April, and those who are mindful of social science will naturally recall a great fallen star, Bogdanov (A. Bogdanoff). He was born in 1873 and died on April 7, 1928, at the age of 55. Although his death gave us deep regret, it also showed greater significance: originally, in his later years, he returned to the medicine he had specialized in, working as the director of the Serum Medical Research Institute under the Soviet People's Health Department in Moscow. His death was a sacrifice he made in serum experiments. For the practical effect of promoting the health and welfare of the whole people, he sacrificed his body without hesitation. This spirit is particularly sublime for our Chinese capitalist medical community! We can learn a serious lesson from this! Time flies, and now it is the eighth anniversary of his death.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, Bogdanov was a sincere revolutionary and a learned scholar. He wrote a lot and had a lot of original ideas. He was also very accomplished in literature. Among his well-known works is his creation "Red Star," which has been translated into many languages. His collection of literary criticism "Art and Labor" on the study of proletarian art is a valuable document in the construction of art theory. In fact, it is the product of his rich experience in real life and social science. He served as the chairman of the All-Russian Supreme Economic Council, and he had an overwhelming reputation in the theory of social economy! We know that the study of labor relations between people belongs to the fundamental task of economics, but it must involve other aspects of the production process. As long as the "technical" and "conscious" aspects affect the development of social labor relations, we must immediately consider them. This is because it is the technological development of the means of production that determines general economic relations; therefore, the facts of technical life are important for our research. Here, Bogdanov has clearly pointed this out in his book "Economic Science."</p>
<p>This is a world-famous work. Among many economic works, it can be regarded as the most systematic masterpiece. We can learn from this book about social economic phenomena and the process of social evolution. Therefore, we Ning regard it as "Principles of Economics," and even read it as a "History of Social Evolution." The book begins with a natural self-sufficient society and discusses commercial society, systematically and in detail narrating the drama of the economic process. It excavates the fundamental contradictions of the instability of various relations, and draws some conclusions, that is, the establishment of collectivism—a new culturalism; it replaces power and individualism. Although they have a common point in their efforts to unite and organize, the bourgeoisie does not care about the ideal of freedom. What it maintains is only individual rights limited by oneself, which is not based on the relationship between people, but on the separation between people. In collectivism, the individual is collective, and is only regarded as one of the unbreakable chain of living links, which is completely different. Therefore, collectivism negates authoritarianism in principle and excludes all foundations of religious feelings and thoughts. It puts the experience of the social labor community first and uses it as a touchstone for all truth and value, especially applicable to the category of economics and social science; thus, it exposes the ugliness of commodity fetishism. Under the shell of value, it discovers crystallized collective labor, thereby organizing a common human ideology and cooperative forces. It creates the theory of historical materialism, that is, the theory that the social production process is the basis of social development. Here, I must specifically point out that historical materialism is different from economic history, and on the contrary, making that kind of mixed interpretation, such as Seligman, commits a serious mistake.</p>
<p>Since collectivism recognizes that human beings are organized into groups determined by production relations, that is the social consciousness of the labor community, scientific socialism. Today, when capitalism has entered its final stage in the 20th century, the rise of socialism has already overthrown one-sixth of the world's capitalism. The main characteristics of the direction of the movement of social forces have been clearly expressed. However, it is currently impossible to fully observe the subtle points of future society because social phenomena are very complex. In the last chapter of the book, "Socialized Organized Society," the author reveals the general outline of its theory and practice. Some people suspect that science has no power to discuss things that have not yet arrived, but the author tells us that science exists precisely to predict things. According to my personal opinion, science is originally attached to philosophy and goes hand in hand. Although the nature of philosophy is based on internal images as its fundamental problem, its psychological internal images come from the results of scientific exploration of external things, such as the author's other book with the same style as this book, "Social Consciousness Studies," which lays the cornerstone of scientific research with thinking methods. Therefore, although it is a philosophical treatise, it is also a book that discusses culture as a whole and has a scientific appearance. For example, what he suggests to us is this: the cause of a social consciousness phenomenon is also to be found in other social consciousness phenomena, and its path is as follows: all the causes of development of all social forms exist within the realm of production, that is, in the social and natural labor struggle. This is the social causality, that is, the reason why science can draw conclusions about future societies that have not been experienced.</p>
<p>Indeed, ideology is a means of carrying out economic life, and thus becomes an important condition for economic evolution. Therefore, unless we do not explore economic science, otherwise the study of ideology becomes necessary. This so-called social consciousness includes language, writing, art, philosophy, religion, morality, customs, law, thought, science, and other "culture" or "spiritual culture"; Bogdanov's "Social Consciousness Studies" can better explain it in historical order, explaining the essence and evolution of social consciousness and where it will go. In fact, this book can be said to be a history of cultural development. I have really never seen such a complete series of monographs on the scientific study of thinking methods, especially in which I was fortunate enough to find more important inspirations. In this era when financial capital has been completed, capitalism is increasingly on the road to collapse, causing extraordinary crises. The world war is about to break out. Unfortunately, this is generally believed to inevitably lead to a sudden shaking and even collapse of ideology. On the contrary, this book suggests that the world war obviously provides more materials than peacetime militarism, showing the nature of the capitalist system, and quickly leads to the unparalleled tension of human unity and group organizational ability, to fight nature, to subdue nature, and to develop labor power to infinity.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to pick out a particularly worthy discussion point mentioned in this book; -- the original form of all labor processes is the occurrence of language. According to the theory of the new school of linguistics in recent years, Marr (who is a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences), the characteristics of human labor behavior, that is, consciousness, are closely related to language. The human society that creates language is constantly changing, so the structure of language is also constantly changing. We must unify human language as a common general organizational form for the whole world, so the Esperanto movement is necessary, but the author of this book says that this movement is entirely due to the fantasy of the intellectual class. In fact, if we examine the organizational form of the whole behavior based on the actual unity of human life, the formation of language unity is undoubtedly. Although this book has been found to have such a point that is worthy of investigation, it does not detract from the series of theories in the whole book, we should carefully read it.</p>
<p>On the eve of the outbreak of the World War, we especially need solid social and economic knowledge. Without this knowledge, we cannot help but wander around and fail to find a way out in this extraordinary period. Why don't we remember Bogdanov's inspiration? In his "Economic Science" and "Social Consciousness Studies." The latter has been translated by Mr. Chen Wangdao and Shi Cuntong, and the former has been translated by Mr. Shi and renamed "Outline of Economic Science." Published by Kaiming Bookstore.</p>
<p>It is April, and eight years have passed since the death of a sincere revolutionary. Infinite admiration, infinite remembrance, envelop the fragile soul, especially after I read his two great masterpieces.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Ba Jin's "Underwater Dream" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Qingshui</p>
<p>Was it early summer last year? I asked Jing Shen what his personal life was like, and he replied, "Recently, I've been reading Ba Jin's novels extensively…" This made me, who had already read some of Ba Jin's novels, even more interested in reading them due to Jing Shen's "extensive reading" recommendation. Like this, I grabbed his "Maritime Miscellany" and "Underwater Dream," printed by Kaiming Bookstore, and ran to the library far from my residence, sat on a circular chair with a heating pipe, and devoured them in one go on two different days. I loved both books, but among the two, I especially fell in love with this "Underwater Dream."</p>
<p>Because, from the short records, one can see what we want to see and should see: "No sorrow, no memories. I only have happiness, only hope." "I am waiting, I am preparing, I am full of hope, full of faith." "I don't need love, love only causes pain." "I would rather be tormented to death by the longing of those who admire you… than betray my faith and write a confession to exchange for freedom, to exchange for freedom to live the life of a noblewoman as before." Shouting, "Perhaps I still lack courage, but I have flesh, blood, and emotions. I cannot allow myself to rot here in the season when all things begin to flourish, without doing anything." The heroic achievements and souls of the men and women who fought for freedom and national liberation. As we read page after page, we felt a sense of empathy, as if watching a bitter struggle of a human-eat-human life battle unfolding before our eyes. I shed tears, I sympathized, I rejoiced, I exclaimed, feeling that the author's words, "Here there are laments, despair, tears, contradictions, struggles, but the result gave me a hope," were most reasonable. After finishing the book and closing my eyes to think, I felt that in this world full of gunpowder and blood, if there were honest and strong warriors willing to fight and sacrifice constantly for "freedom" and "justice," then this new world full of hope and worth cherishing would unfold before our eyes; we cannot regard it as a vague dream, we must be able to find it.</p>
<p>We fully understand that this unusual and groundbreaking fairy tale, written by grasping the core of this unusual era, is not a fabrication based on the author's genius imagination. We know who the "Liberlo Island" nation in the Pacific is, and we also know who the invaders called the "High Country" are. The shocking story of the great massacre (in the second half of the book) is not entirely woven from remarkable imagination. The author's subtle description at the end (page 130) is worthy of our utmost attention. To put it plainly, it can simply be said that this is a fresh and powerful fairy tale with content, written against the backdrop of our "old empire," where national crises are accumulating day by day, and the country is in turmoil and danger. This tortuous and magnificent story contains the events from "September 18th" to "January 28th." This is a product of passion, it can be said to be a darling of the times. Without the background of constantly occurring real-life massacres, large-scale massacres, to stir the author's boiling heart and blood, it might not have been possible to write it so vividly, with tears and blood intertwined. It might not have been so easy to "seep in a lot of blood or tears from the land." It might not have been possible for this thin little book to be unusually pregnant with "This is a sea of blood, a sea of tears. The blood is the blood of Chinese civilians. The tears are the tears of Chinese civilians." On the other hand, if there had not been the unprecedented inhumane "January 28th" Shanghai massacre by capitalist imperialists, the author would not have been able to squeeze out his own blood and tears and drip them inside. "This is a product of enthusiasm, I wrote it without even thinking. It was the enthusiasm that didn't allow me to think, because it wanted to burst out itself. Every night I picked up my pen and wrote, and when I felt I could pause for a while, I put down my pen. I wrote very quickly, and I felt very happy while writing." This scene would also have been difficult to erupt and surge onto the author's pen tip in such a rushing and leaping manner.</p>
<p>This thin book, without any ambiguity, depicts vividly and incisively, although not as pungent as Lu Xun's pen, as leisurely as Zhou Zuoren's style, or as delicate as Yu Dafu's novels, it is as unrestrained as Guo Moruo's early works, and as coherent and readable as Yu Dafu's novels. In fact, writing a fairy tale that bites into the core of the times and is pregnant with the exchange of blood and tears is not comparable to ordinary essays and miscellanies, and in fact, there is no need for excessively pungent writing or unlimited leisure and delicate depictions. This is something that must be known when reading this book. As for the generous and tragic narration of the story, the descriptions in the first part are so vivid and lifelike. In the second part, there is the display of tragic pictures, the praise of fighting achievements, and the description of the heart's contest between love and freedom. This tortuous and winding depiction, this indirect and subtle foil, and this detailed description of psychological changes further highlight the soul of Lina, a female hero who sacrifices everything for freedom, which is worthy of praise and song.</p>
<p>This year is said to be an extremely terrible year, and the situation in the High Country is even more conspicuously different. Several years ago, when the author was writing, he keenly and insightfully scolded that our men are all submissive slaves, although sometimes not, but when others use machine guns and cannons against them, they all kneel down in a despicable manner. "They only know how to seek their own interests. For this interest, they can even sell their beliefs and their own parents." Now, looking at it, in addition to self-criticism and self-encouragement, we also feel the value of this "Underwater Dream," which the author wrote with his blood and tears. The cries of "national crisis literature," "national defense literature," and "national art" have resounded through the clouds. Readers! Isn't this a complete product written with our Chinese "sea of blood" and "sea of tears," a mixture of genuine feelings, enthusiasm, and strength, with thought and content? If we are unwilling to be "ordinary" and "submissive," and know that "the fate of slaves can only be decided by the slaves themselves," then, please read the words, "Freedom, is there anything more beautiful than you?…" and dedicate yourself to the cause, sacrificing all your personal happiness to pursue the happiness of the masses. In this "book filled with laments, despair, tears, contradictions, struggles, and finally completely covered by a hope," seek the true meaning of freedom and survival, strive to open up a new way of life, resist invaders and occupiers, to achieve the final victory when the time for the final reckoning arrives!</p>
<p>Such a year requires such an enthusiastic and powerful book. This is not only taking stimulants, but there are also many vitamins inside. If I am qualified to recommend literary books suitable for this turbulent pre-war period, I will not hesitate to first recommend this "Underwater Dream."</p>

<p>"One Hundred Thousand Whys"</p>
<p>Written by Ilyin, Translated by Dong Chuncai</p>
<p>Price 35 cents, Published by Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>How important science is in today's China has already been discussed in many articles in various newspapers and books, and I don't want to say more. But to study science, one must first have an interest in studying, and then one can "bury oneself in hard work." Some publishers seem to have noticed this point now. But books as interesting as this "One Hundred Thousand Whys" seem to be rare. A few days ago, I accidentally bought this book at Kaiming Bookstore and read it several times in a row, and the more I read it, the more I loved it. Regarding the name of the book, I had seen it several times before and always regarded it as "one hundred thousand" why, thinking it was a profound mathematics book; because my interests didn't quite match, I didn't buy it. Now I know that it is one hundred thousand "whys"; meaning many "whys." The text inside is also very simple and easy to understand, even for high school students. It can entice back the heart of someone who sees science as an enemy. Now, I will briefly list a few of its advantages and introduce them to people who have always disliked science. Of course, people who love science can read it even more:</p>
<p>First, using fairy tales to introduce science. Scientific texts have always liked to use a serious tone, listing many formulas, putting on a stern face, forcing you to memorize many principles, and do many exercises; making you feel apprehensive and disgusted as soon as you see it, and never wanting to get close to it. As a result, not only is there no benefit to you, but also, imperceptibly, you will no longer want to understand it.</p>
<p>The author of this book seems to be well aware of this problem. He not only doesn't put on a stern face, but is also afraid that you will put it down, deliberately using some interesting conversations or fairy-tale text to earnestly entice you to ask him questions, and then give you concise answers one by one. Making you feel like you are "having a heart-to-heart talk" with a close friend, and unintentionally gaining a lot of everyday knowledge. Let's just flip open a page and take a look:</p>
<p>"Burning dry pine branches crackles and pops. The cheerful flames, like a country fiddler, make everything in the kitchen dance: the blue ceramic teapot throws its lid into the air like a hat, then immediately catches it again. The frying pan splatters with steam, shaking with joy. The big copper pot also forgets its dignity, giggling like an idiot, overflowing with boiling water, and flowing straight into the nearby iron pot. You all call this a kitchen - but I call it a chemical laboratory."</p>
<p>Reading this passage, you can immediately imagine the scene of a lively kitchen. Then he will stand in this laboratory and tell you that "a small dough suddenly comes alive in the mixing bowl." "A piece of meat in a soup pot changes its appearance after an hour, becoming unrecognizable."... Then, he will tell you these questions in detail, fascinating you.</p>
<p>Second, telling stories from science. We can also call this book "Science Stories." Because there are many science stories in it. It can be roughly divided into two types: one is to write all scientific changes into stories. The other is stories about the invention and development of various things. For example, in "Sick Buttons," he says that tinware can also get sick, and tells a story:</p>
<p>"Seventy years ago, in a certain army in Leningrad, tinware had such an epidemic. The armed buttons used on the soldiers' uniforms were all stored in a food cabinet. Suddenly, a suspicious rash was found on the buttons, and immediately all the buttons were covered with black spots. Everyone was extremely surprised... The buttons crumbled into powder before their eyes...</p>
<p>"Scientists spent a long time racking their brains trying to explain the cause of this strange disease. Later, they finally found out, what do you think it was?...</p>
<p>Such interesting stories are interspersed throughout the book and can be seen almost everywhere. Such as the invention of porcelain by Boettger in Europe, the secret manufacture of mirrors by the Venetians, the first fork to arrive in England, the eating habits of ancient people, etc., are all very interesting, and it is perfectly fine to read them as pure stories.</p>
<p>Third, fresh questions, concise answers. Many science writers often write very common questions in a very mysterious way. So things that were originally easy to understand become confusing after reading his book. All the questions in this book are very common, but they have been overlooked by many people, so they seem very fresh when they are raised. For example, he asks: "Is there opaque water, is there transparent iron?" This kind of question is something that ordinary people would never think of, but the author tells you: "In fact, only the upper layer of water is transparent. Isn't the bottom layer of the ocean pitch black?" "Not long ago, a scientist made a piece of iron that was only one hundred thousandth of a hair thick. This piece of iron is as transparent as glass." There are many, many such fresh questions and concise answers, which become the backbone of this book.</p>
<p>The book divides a room into seven wharves, and from these seven wharves, it talks about more than sixty "whys," and from these big "whys," it branches out into more small questions. If drawn into a table, it is like a lush tree. But although there are so many questions and answers, the whole book is only one hundred and seventeen pages. It only takes two or three hours to read it; in other words, you can get countless scientific knowledge from this book in just two or three hours. Moreover, most of this knowledge is rarely seen in other science books.</p>

<p>Chengzhong Middle and Elementary School 35th Anniversary Publication</p>
<h3 id="e217">Preface <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Youxiao</p>
<p>Our school has been in existence for thirty-five years. Tracing back to the late school principal, Mr. Ye Chengzhong, he died on his deathbed, unable to personally witness its success. However, later sages have all been able to uphold his legacy, diligently and cautiously. Starting from elementary education to middle school, thousands of graduates of this school have served society. This is truly an immortal achievement. However, as the school's reputation grows, the responsibility of those who follow in his footsteps becomes increasingly arduous and significant. Mr. Ye's dying words were: "Strive for proper and lasting arrangements, so that those who study here may make progress in their learning. The great may aspire to become talents, and the small may also be able to find employment." Furthermore, at the beginning of the school's establishment, Western merchants Mr. 克勞克 and Mr. 李佳白 came to congratulate him upon hearing of it and said that the Chinese people have no perseverance and are selfish and harmful to the public. A large sum of money would be embezzled and used up. Why not entrust it to the Engineering Bureau or the Church? Mr. Ye spoke of this to the school directors, Mr. Chen and Mr. Fan, who both disagreed. Later, Mr. Chen recounted the matter to the former principal, Mr. Cao, and said, "Over the past thirty years, other things may not be worth discussing, but the fact that this school still exists and the funds are still there is a great source of pride for our people." This shows Mr. Ye's high expectations and the commendable foresight of the former sages in achieving the greatness of this school. Therefore, how can those who come later easily inherit this legacy, preserve its good name, and pass it on to future generations? Now, on the anniversary of the school's establishment, we respectfully publish this memorial to illuminate Mr. Ye's great vision for education and the contributions of those who have dedicated themselves to this school in the past, so that those who follow in their footsteps may be aware of the difficulty and importance of their responsibility, and further encourage themselves to extend the ambitions of their predecessors and serve society and the nation. If this publication is carried out, will it not be like the brocade of Persia? Virtuous people of the country, if you would come forward and teach them, then that would be fortunate.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Congratulating My Alma Mater on its 35th Anniversary <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Shi</p>
<p>I am very happy to participate in the 35th anniversary publication of my alma mater because I have received great favor from Chengzhong School. I recorded the benefits I received at Chengzhong in my "Forty-Year Autobiography" (pages 95-110). I entered Chengzhong in the spring of 1905, and I left Chengzhong during the summer vacation of that year. I have been away from Chengzhong for a full thirty years. But now, when I recall that year and a half, I still feel that it was the most beneficial period of my childhood.</p>
<p>When I think back to my time at Chengzhong, the most beneficial aspects were the rigorous training in English and mathematics. Among the two, the most helpful was English. At that time, there were very few universities, so the status of middle schools was higher, and it was possible to hire very good teachers. Chengzhong's English teachers, such as Mr. Zhang Jingren and Mr. Chen Shihhao, were all able to speak, write, and explain in detail. They all came from St. John's University, and their thoughts and opinions may not have been very high. For example, they used "Peter Parley's" world history to teach us. The first chapter was about God creating the world, the second chapter was about the flood,... and the last chapter was about Confucius, with an illustration of Confucius wearing a Qing Dynasty hat and court beads! Although their views sometimes had a bit of the narrowness of church schools, they also brought rigorous language training from church schools, making them the best middle school English teachers. There was a calligraphy exercise every day, a dictation every day, and sentence-making and composition exercises every day, all of which were corrected every day and scored every month. A year and a half of rigorous training gave me some basic skills in reading and writing, and I cannot but thank these teachers.</p>
<p>Therefore, I infer that middle school is the most important period of life, and its importance lies in the development of academic skills and habits. Skills and habits cannot be developed by simply instilling knowledge; they must rely on daily practice. Therefore, the selection of middle school teachers must focus on proficiency in skills and earnestness in training. If the teachers themselves are not proficient in their skills, for example, if an English teacher cannot write, read, or speak, how can he develop the skills of others? If the teachers are unwilling to seriously train students, for example, if an English teacher is afraid of correcting papers, how can he develop the students' working habits?</p>
<p>Chengzhong School has a foundation, and among private middle schools in the country, it is one of the most financially strong. However, those who run Chengzhong have never dared to admire the vanity of "upgrading," and have not dared to run a senior middle school, but have always used all their strength to run a junior middle school and an elementary school. This is Chengzhong's greatest glory, and it is a model that Chengzhong can use for the whole country. I hope that Chengzhong's directors and principals will always maintain this noble spirit of not upgrading, and will always use all their energy to run the most earnest junior middle school and elementary school. The foundation can be increased as much as possible - I hope that the founder's family members, school directors, and graduates can help increase the school's foundation - but after the foundation is rich, I still hope that Chengzhong will not run a high school, but only raise the salaries of teachers and improve the selection of teachers, so that Chengzhong becomes the most successful junior middle school in the country. This small suggestion is my congratulatory gift.</p>
<h3 id="e219">A Brief Biography of Mr. Ye Chengzhong <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Ye Chengzhong, also known as Chengzhong, was a native of Zhenhai. His ancestors were farmers. He became an orphan at the age of six. There were three brothers, with Chengzhong being the second. At the age of nine, he went to a private tutor to study. After less than half a year, he dropped out of school due to poverty. At the age of eleven, he worked as a hired hand in an oil mill. The mistress treated him badly. Angered, he left home. A local named Ni saw him and took pity on him, agreeing to take him to Shanghai. He needed two thousand coins for travel expenses. His mother, Mrs. Hong, pledged the autumn harvest as collateral to make the trip possible. He was then recommended to work in a grocery store in the French Concession. After three years, the store owner became decadent and did not manage the business. He left and independently traded with foreign ships in the Huangpu River by boat. He learned from foreigners and became fluent in their language. In the first year of Tongzhi, he set up a small shop in the Hongkou area. That winter, he moved the shop outside the Hongkou area. After that, he planned his business, which expanded day by day, with branch shops spreading to various treaty ports. He also established match factories and silk reeling factories in Hanzhen, north of Shanghai. He was by nature fond of righteousness. His good deeds include establishing Huaidetang, Zhongxiaotang, charity schools, cowpox bureaus, Chongyi Associations, Guangyitang; he also contributed to academies, water conservancy, assisting widows and orphans, leveling beams and repairing roads, and providing clothing, rice, and medicine, the annual cost of which was incalculable. In the year of Guangxu Wuzi, the province was hit by famine, and he was the first to donate a large sum of money to provide relief. He received a commendation from the Qing Emperor and was given a plaque inscribed with "Fond of Charity and Good Deeds, Courageous in Doing Good." He was also extremely filial. When his mother was ill, he cut flesh from his thigh to mix with medicine to give her. His clan had no ancestral lineage or genealogy, so he completed it on his own. In his later years, reflecting on his childhood poverty and lack of education, he donated thirty acres of land and ten thousand gold in Zhangjiawan, Hongkou, Shanghai, to build Chengzhong School. Construction began in September of Guangxu Gengzi and was completed in February of the following year. Chengzhong died the year before. On his deathbed, he left a letter to the school directors Fan Fen and others, encouraging them to carefully plan and manage the school for lasting success. His sons also donated two hundred thousand gold to cover annual expenses. At first, they offered elementary education, followed by middle school. Graduates of the school have made a name for themselves in various fields. In gratitude for the school principal's virtue, a bronze statue was erected on the 20th anniversary. This year, the number of students in primary and secondary schools is even greater than before, reaching 1,500. On April 16, the 35th anniversary of the school's establishment, a celebration was held according to custom, which is fifteen years after the statue was erected. Chengzhong was posthumously awarded the title of Grand Master of the Glorious Rank in the Qing Dynasty, and he died in October of the 25th year of Guangxu. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Tang, his second wife, Mrs. Xia, and his concubine, Mrs. Su. He had seven sons: Yijian, Yizhao, Yiming, Yiquan, Yiqi, Yiyong, and Yiyu.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Celebrating the 35th Anniversary of Chengzhong <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Xianting</p>
<p>On the 35th anniversary of the establishment of Chengzhong Alma Mater, Principal Wu Cuilun sent me a letter with sincere words and a sense of righteousness that could not be refused. From my entry into the school at a young age until now, I have spent more than twenty winters and summers, half of which were spent under the education of Chengzhong. A year ago, I was honored by the Board of Directors to assist in school affairs. Although it has been a very short time, my feelings have deepened. On this grand occasion, I cannot but offer a few words of praise.</p>
<p>School Principal Ye lost his education in his youth, but when he prospered, he generously took on the responsibility of popularizing education, building a large building, hiring good teachers, and attracting students to bathe in education. Today, when people talk about secondary education in Shanghai, many take Chengzhong as a model. Tracing back to the source, would it have been easy to achieve this without the founding merits of Mr. Ye? Although Chengzhong was founded by Mr. Ye, Mr. Ye's reputation will also be eternally immortalized by Chengzhong. The good people eat the reward, it is appropriate!</p>
<p>Chengzhong was established in Hongkou, where there are many families below the middle class. Talented children are often troubled by circumstances, dropping out of school halfway and unable to develop their strengths. After the establishment of Chengzhong, with complete courses and particularly low fees, they began to come to study one after another, even if they were rejected due to being full, they would rather wait a little longer than go elsewhere. Over the past thirty-five years, it has cultivated talents in the thousands! Although Chengzhong's tuition income is low, the treatment of teachers and staff is not meager. Shanghai is a gathering place for human culture, with many schools. Over the past thirty or forty years, it has been able to make teachers feel at ease in their jobs, not being distracted by the thickness or lack of salary, except for Chengzhong, there are not many that can be found: this is the hard work of the teachers and the principals of each school to maintain, and all of our teachers and students have benefited from it, and we should all be grateful for it!</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, the alma mater held the 20th anniversary celebration and the unveiling ceremony of the bronze statue of the school principal. The former principal, Teacher Cao Weiwu, gave a generous speech, encouraging the students to study hard and not fail the school principal's hard work in establishing the school. Today, the bronze statue of the school principal stands tall, and Teacher Cao's legacy also seems to be in our ears, but it is no longer possible to shake hands and speak with him, and to personally receive his cough! Teacher Cao devoted himself to school affairs, rewarding and supporting the younger generation, and has never slackened in the past twenty years. He was "transformed into death, feeling sad without end! Fortunately, my Chengzhong's future is getting brighter and brighter, and Teacher Cao's legacy is being continued by someone. If he knew about it underground, he would surely be comforted."</p>
<p>I was born late, and I am even less of an expert in educational administration. Years ago, I assisted in school affairs and received a lot of guidance from Principal Wu Cuilun. Mr. Wu is a famous senior in the education field, self-motivated and diligent, and has written extensively about his virtue and hard work. Now, Mr. Chen Yusun is an assistant, complementing each other even more: the joy of getting talent is even more congratulatory! On this auspicious day of the 35th anniversary of the alma mater, I dare to offer a rustic poem as a toast to the Board of Directors and the two teachers, Mr. Wu and Mr. Chen, saying: Beautiful is the Huangpu River, with buildings facing each other. Only my Chengzhong, with many students rushing. Thirty-five years of good fortune, with chanting sounding loud. The education and blessings will last forever, becoming the glory of the country!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Private Chengzhong Middle and Elementary School 35th Anniversary Congratulatory Speech <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Jinyao</p>
<p>Chengzhong, my alma mater, was founded solely by Mr. Ye with well-regulated facilities and teachers who patiently guided students. Consequently, the students all possessed a spirit of enduring hardship and perseverance. I, Jinyao, graduated and left the school nearly ten years ago. Now, on the occasion of this anniversary, I am serving at the Kobe Consulate and unable to attend the grand celebration in person. Therefore, I offer this speech as a congratulation.</p>
<p>Nurturing talent and promoting education strengthens the nation. A visionary, our Mr. Ye, a benevolent person with widespread influence, shares his goodness with others. Teachers and students gather, joyful and harmonious. Thirty-five years have passed, renown fills the nation. Talented individuals emerge in increasing numbers, boundless and magnificent. On this anniversary, we recall his noble character. With a sincere heart, I offer my blessings to Chengzhong.</p>
<p>Investing heavily in education is the glory of the Ye family. It began here thirty-five years ago. His educational grace is profound and lasting. I came from the East, carrying gifts to enter its doors. Fellow students, numerous, looked to those before them and were looked to by those after. Having completed our studies, we went forth, indeed flourishing. Hearing of the occasion, all come together, always having meals provided. May those who come after not forget to magnify and glorify it.</p>

<h3 id="e223">35th Anniversary Song of This School <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Xu</p>
<p>The literary star shines brightly over the Huangpu River, a grand building stands tall on Tangshan Road. The school flag reaches high into the Wusong clouds, cheers break through the Hongqiao mist. Numerous bright young students come and go from morning till night. What school is this, named Chengzhong, that has existed for thirty-five years? Chengzhong is originally Mr. Ye's courtesy name; Mr. Ye was the son of a farmer. Regretting his own poverty that prevented his education, in his later years, he specially donated land north of Shanghai. Generously spending one hundred thousand gold, he founded a school to shelter impoverished scholars. Managing and building it, it was completed in no time, and his wise son was able to continue his aspirations. Again, he spent the huge sum of two hundred thousand, with Qin Jia (Honorable Fan, known as Old Man Qin Jia, was a school trustee) and other gentlemen as managers. In the twenty-seventh year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty, Chengzhong Elementary School began. Who advocated for it? Liu Binke (Liu Shuping of Wujin). Celebrated figures of the time, Cai Zhangbai (Cai Yuanpei of Shanyin, Zhang Qin of Ninghai, and Bai Zuolin of Tongzhou) served as principals, heads of education, and supervisors. All these gentlemen were literary giants. Outstanding talents gathered together, peach trees and plum trees filled the door, spreading educational grace. The clock tower stands west of the school building, nearby residents first learned the time from it. After the change of dynasties and vicissitudes of life, the spiritual light stands tall, uniquely becoming more brilliant. In the spring of the Republic's founding, everything was new. Mr. Cao (Cao Muguan of Shangyu) was the head of Changcheng School. School affairs thrived day by day, the scale changed monthly and yearly. Ten years after the Qinghe month of the Republic, a bronze statue unveiling ceremony was held, with honored guests. Thinking of the source while drinking water, the reputation spread far and wide, surpassing others. Mr. Ge (Ge Zulan of Cixi) succeeded him, making many proposals. The Cheng Hall was spacious, accommodating thousands of people. The 30th-anniversary memorial objects, books displayed in the Shimei Hall. Construction was expected to be perfect, but the changing situation brought turmoil. Later, Mr. Chen (Chen Binhe of Wuxian) came to head the school, assisted by Mr. Wu who was good at teaching. Before long, Chen left and Wu was promoted, working diligently and effectively. Excellent and refined education was renewed daily, full of vitality and radiance. The signed scholars have been blowing reeds for many years; those with dull minds should laugh at themselves. The school's history spans thirty-five weeks; commemorative writing is essential. Mr. Wu solicited a commemorative article from me, but Jiang Lang's pen is worn out and lacks talent. This matter cannot be without words, so I edited the school history for exploration. Stroking my beard, I created this commemorative song, respectfully wishing the school's reputation to spread in all directions.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The author of this song has worked at this school for as long as thirty years.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Overview of This School <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Youxiao</p>
<p>I. History</p>
<p>The school's founder, Mr. Ye Chengzhong of Zhenhai, donated funds to establish the school in September of the 25th year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty. In February of the 27th year, the school was established, named Chengzhong Elementary School, offering ordinary elementary and higher elementary education. The board of directors hired Liu Shuping as the director to manage school affairs. In the 29th year, a middle school was added, and the school name dropped the character for "elementary". Commercial and normal school departments were also added, but the latter two were later discontinued. In February of the 31st year, Jiangsu Governor Lu Yuanding requested that the school be registered with the government. In the winter of the 33rd year, the middle school was discontinued. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed Private Chengzhong Elementary and Higher Elementary School. In February of the second year, the middle school was re-established. In July of the third year, the school year began in the autumn. In January of the fourth year, the Ministry of Education approved the registration. In the autumn of the ninth year, a Class A commercial course was added. In October of the tenth year, the school founder's bronze statue was unveiled. In the autumn of the twelfth year, both the elementary, middle, and commercial courses were changed to a four-two system. In the summer of the fifteenth year, the old middle and commercial courses completed their graduation. In the autumn, a high school and vocational course were added. In the summer of the sixteenth year, the vocational course was abolished, and the high school was discontinued. In February of the seventeenth year, it was submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education for approval, and the middle school was named Private Chengzhong Middle School, and the elementary school was named Private Chengzhong Middle School Affiliated Elementary School. Both middle and elementary schools added spring semester classes and changed the middle school to a three-three system. In the summer of the nineteenth year, the commercial course completed its graduation and was also discontinued. In the autumn, the high school was re-established. In March of the twentieth year, the Ministry of Education approved the registration. In the spring of the twenty-first year, the high school was discontinued. In February of the twenty-third year, in accordance with the Ministry of Education's order, the elementary school used a specific name, removing the affiliated status, and was called Private Chengzhong Elementary School, with the principal concurrently serving as the principal of the middle school. This is a general overview of the major changes in the school's name and department settings over the past 35 years.</p>
<p>When Director Liu Shuping took leave, Cai Yuanpei acted as his agent. Following Liu, Zhang Qin and Bai Zuolin served as principals, all referred to as "Zhangjiao" (掌敎, head of teaching), while Jiang Yuanqing was referred to as "Superintendent." All of the above individuals were assisted by a head of teaching, who was in charge of inspecting courses, similar to today's Dean of Academic Affairs. After Jiang, Xie Guan was appointed, and the title became "Xiaowei" (校畏, school head), without a head of teaching. In the first year of the Republic of China, Cao Muguan succeeded as principal, and the position of Dean of Academic Affairs was re-established, also appointed by the board of directors. This system has continued to this day. Principal Cao held the position for the longest time (16 years). After Cao left, Dean of Academic Affairs Ge Zulan succeeded him, followed by Li Naiji and Chen Binhe. Principal Chen resigned in July of the twenty-third year, and the board of directors appointed Youxiao to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>When the school was first established, there were only 125 students. Later, the number of students gradually increased, reaching 1,345 in the autumn of the twentieth year. After the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the number of students suddenly decreased by four-tenths. Later, it gradually recovered, reaching 1,456 this year, setting a new record.</p>
<p>The initial school site was only 24 mu, 8 fen, 5 li, and 4 hao. After successive purchases, it now has 34 mu, 6 fen, and 8 li. Excluding the Huai De Hall (where the founder and trustees are worshiped), which occupies 3 mu, 4 fen, 4 li, and 7 hao, the actual total is 31 mu, 2 fen, 3 li, and 3 hao. However, three to four tenths of it are rented out, and only six to seven tenths are used for the school itself.</p>
<p>In terms of school buildings, the initial construction consisted of 30 main buildings and 15 side buildings, along with a covered playground. Subsequently, there were five major additions and renovations: A large self-ringing clock and five clock towers; More than ten buildings on the west side and a kitchen and dining hall; Enlargement of the kitchen and dormitory for school staff; Renovation of the covered playground into Cheng Hall (gymnasium and auditorium), and the addition of a bathhouse; The Shimei Hall, commemorating the 30th anniversary. The total area occupied is almost equal to the original buildings. This is another overview of the gradual expansion of the school's history, number of students, and school site and buildings over the past 35 years.</p>
<p>II. Current Situation</p>
<p>Since the separation of the elementary and middle schools in the spring of the twenty-third year, although they are two separate schools in name, in fact, apart from the organizational and teaching departments of the middle and elementary schools being different due to their different natures, the use of school buildings and equipment, the distribution of funds, and the coordination of affairs are still like one school. The general situation described below is mainly about the middle school, with special notes on the differences in the elementary school.</p>
<p>Administrative Organization: The principal manages all administrative affairs of the school, assisted by the Dean of Academic Affairs. The administrative system is divided into five departments: academic affairs, student affairs, physical education (physical education is not independent in the elementary school), general affairs (called general affairs in the elementary school, with slightly different scope), and finance. Each department is headed by a director and several staff members. There is also a school doctor in charge of the school's hygiene matters, and a library director in charge of the school's library matters (the elementary school has a library instructor). Each grade has a grade leader who assists the student affairs director in handling student affairs matters in each grade. In addition, there are various meetings and committees. The purpose of the school's internal organization is to emphasize the division of labor and public meetings. Therefore, the responsibilities of each department are distributed, and the spirit of the whole school strives for unity, aiming to achieve the goal of co-governance through the method of division of labor.</p>
<p>School Site, School Equipment, and Facilities: The school site has been described above. There are more than 160 school buildings, which are sufficient for use. There are also two school gardens and two sports fields, both of which are too small. There are more than 7,900 pieces of school equipment. There are more than 2,000 pieces of natural science instruments, medicines, specimens, models, and wall charts, accounting for about three-quarters of the standard issued by the ministry; more than 1,000 pieces of sports equipment; more than 300 pieces of labor equipment; and more than 58,000 volumes of Chinese and Western books, which are currently in use.</p>
<p>Finances: The income from tuition, meals, and accommodation each semester is about 25,000 yuan, and the expenditure is 40,000 yuan (75% for teaching salaries, 11% for equipment expenses, and 14% for administrative expenses), leaving a deficit of about 15,000 yuan, which is subsidized by the board of directors. The staff of the finance department are appointed by the board of directors, and the accounts are audited by the principal on a regular basis. The final accounts at the end of the semester are audited by an accountant hired by the board of directors and then announced.</p>
<p>Faculty and Staff: There are a total of 67 faculty and staff members in the middle and elementary schools: one person has worked for more than 30 years; one person has worked for more than 20 years; three people have worked for more than 15 years; seven people have worked for more than 10 years; fifteen people have worked for more than 5 years; thirty-five people have worked for less than 5 years; and four people have worked for less than one year. The qualifications of most people are that middle school teachers are graduates of domestic universities, and elementary school teachers are graduates of normal schools. The average monthly salary is 75 yuan for middle school teachers and 44 yuan for elementary school teachers.</p>
<p>Grade System and Students: Both middle and elementary schools have spring and autumn semester grades. Promotion and demotion are based on semesters and are not limited by years. There are currently eight grades in junior high school, one grade in the supplementary class, and 363 students; there are twenty-two grades in elementary school and 1,093 students, totaling 1,456 students. The age of middle school students is a maximum of 17 years and 9 months, and a minimum of 12 years and 1 month, with an average of 15 years and 2 months; the age of elementary school students is a maximum of 16 years, and a minimum of 5 years and 2 months, with an average of 11 years and 6 months. 75% of students are from Zhejiang, and 81% of parents are engaged in commerce.</p>
<p>Curriculum and Teaching Methods: The curriculum of both middle and elementary schools follows the standards issued by the ministry. However, the third grade of middle school adds vocational courses (bookkeeping, typing, etc.), and the fifth and sixth grades of elementary school add English to meet the needs. The teaching methods in middle school combine self-study guidance and problem discussion! The upper grades of elementary school mainly use self-study guidance methods, and the lower grades strive for interest. Academic competitions and various tests are held every semester. In addition, there are prescribed holiday assignments, etc.</p>
<p>Standards of Student Affairs: The standards of student affairs in middle school are as follows:</p>
<p>Shame: Aspire to self-improvement, determined to resist humiliation;</p>
<p>Loyalty: Treat people with honesty and sincerity, be loyal to the party and the country;</p>
<p>Respect: Abide by discipline, respect and love teachers and friends;</p>
<p>Happiness and Health: Be healthy in body and mind, be optimistic in all things;</p>
<p>Courage: Do not fear difficulties, sacrifice and struggle;</p>
<p>Thoroughness: Study hard, think deeply;</p>
<p>Production: Be diligent and hardworking, advocate thrift;</p>
<p>Aesthetics: Appreciate art, love nature.</p>
<p>The student affairs of elementary school are entirely based on the standards of civic training issued by the ministry.</p>
<p>Great is Mr. Ye. May we expand his great power, donate wealth to promote education, enlighten intelligence, lay the foundation in Shanghai, spread its reputation throughout the world, transform education widely, and produce numerous talents. A long history. Highly respected by the masses. Chinese and Western academic studies. Cultural communication. Words and deeds are models. Morality is the foundation. The human heart is righteous.

<p>Respectfully written by Lu Xixian</p>
<p>Implementation Methods of Student Affairs: A flag-raising ceremony is held during morning exercises every day to cultivate a sense of patriotism. (The school flag is raised on Saturdays to cultivate a sense of love for the school.) Students are required to wear uniforms to class to promote neatness and solemnity. In addition, there are group and individual talks, guidance for extracurricular activities, guidance for self-governance activities (the student self-government association in middle school and the Chengzhong City in elementary school), guidance for further education and employment, and family liaison. The goals of physical education are as follows:</p>
<p>To develop all parts of the body evenly and cultivate beautiful and correct posture;</p>
<p>To promote overall health and cultivate healthy living habits;</p>
<p>To develop personality and cultivate the sports skills needed in life;</p>
<p>To emphasize group sports and cultivate the virtues of discipline, chivalry, and benevolence.</p>
<p>The Boy Scout curriculum follows the training objectives issued by the China Boy Scout General Association.</p>
<p>Assessment of Performance: This school places equal emphasis on students' academic performance, conduct, and physical education. Therefore, the assessment is strict. There are three regular examinations for academic performance each semester. Any student who fails any subject will be warned face-to-face by the academic affairs department and urged to make up for it. The standards for promotion and demotion at the end of the semester are generally in accordance with the regulations of the middle school regulations issued by the ministry. Conduct assessment. In addition to the evaluation by each teacher based on the standards, attention is also paid to various daily statistics, such as attendance at commemorative week meetings, attendance at morning exercises and extracurricular sports, extracurricular assignments, library borrowing and reading, service diligence, and statistics on the practice of civic training. The assessment of physical education performance is strict. This school's physical education. Focuses on comprehensive development. Minimum standards have been set for various sports, and there are monthly tests, and the results are announced to encourage the excellent and warn the inferior. Students who fail in conduct or physical education will also not be promoted or graduated.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Where is the Problem of Saving Middle School Students? <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xianhe</p>
<p>—A Point that the Publishing Industry Should Strive For—</p>
<p>Since Ms. Chen Hengzhe raised the issue of saving middle school students in Independent Review, Mr. Fei Ying has also raised the issue of "Where is the Problem of Middle School Students" in the New Youth Weekly. After reading their articles, the author has many thoughts, and now tries to state his humble opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Ms. Chen and Mr. Fei Ying believe that the problem of middle school students lies in the damage to their health, and the reasons for this damage are: first, the curriculum is too heavy; second, the civil service examination system is becoming ossified; and third, high school mathematics and physics are too difficult. According to the author's observation, none of these three points touch on the core of the health problem of middle school students.</p>
<p>At present, the subjects in middle schools are often criticized by students and parents, who believe that there are too many subjects. In fact, the simplicity or complexity of subjects in schools is a reflection of social life and cultural level. If we check the middle school curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, what subjects can be deleted? As for the number of class hours, there is not much to increase or decrease according to the Ministry of Education's regulations. Therefore, the problem of heavy homework does not seem to be a problem. The author completely agrees that the civil service examination system is becoming ossified and that it is necessary to improve the civil service examination, because with the different teaching materials and teaching progress of the current middle schools, it seems to be deliberately making things difficult for middle school students to test the level of middle school students with unified test questions. Therefore, the author believes that the method of civil service examination should be improved, that is, the teaching materials of each school must be consistent, the teaching progress must be consistent, and the test questions of the civil service examination must be aimed at the homework of middle school students and not involve harsh details. However, the author believes that this civil service examination problem is not the main factor that damages the health of middle school students in general. It is indeed a big problem in today's education system that high school mathematics and physics are too difficult and are harmful to young people who do not have mathematical and physical talents, because it is definitely impossible to force the study of advanced knowledge; and if it is forced, not only will there be no progress, but it can also make the brains of middle school students without mathematical and physical talents become numb and stupid. However, assuming that this point is the main factor that damages the health of middle school students, it does not seem to touch on the core of the problem.</p>
<p>The author believes that the main reason why the health of middle school students is damaged today is definitely not the heavy homework, the ossification of the civil service examination system, or the difficulty of high school mathematics and physics, but the problem of sex education for middle school students. At present, the most profound and serious thing that hurts young people is the problem of sexual destruction.</p>
<p>There are many young men and women who have already had sexual relations early in their puberty. In Chinese families, schools, and society, the problem of sex has always been regarded as mysterious and should not be discussed publicly. As a result, these young men and women unfortunately fall into a wrong path, secretly reading various obscene books and pictures, and secretly engaging in various immoral behaviors, destroying their bodies and minds all day and all night. Assuming that we secretly investigate, how profound and widespread is this terrible phenomenon in boys' middle schools or girls' middle schools! Parents have not noticed it, teachers have not noticed it, and society has not noticed it. As a result, young people go deep into the wrong path without knowing it. Destroying their bodies and minds, hindering their health, causing the widespread situation of weak health of this generation of young men and women, and forming a great crisis for the nation!</p>
<p>Assuming that we do not touch on this core cause that affects the health of young people, and think that heavy homework, difficult mathematics and physics, and ossified civil service examinations are the factors that damage the health of young people, then the problem of saving middle school students will still not be solved, and we will be busy in vain for a while.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the author believes that the publishing industry should fulfill a part of its responsibility, because the problem of sex education is in fact the most difficult for teachers in schools to talk about. It is best for the publishing industry to publish several special books on sex education for young people in middle schools and universities, in addition to dissecting the physiology of men and women in detail, and explaining in detail the harms of various immoral behaviors, and giving scientific explanations. After reading them, young people will definitely be alarmed and dare not act recklessly, and with the strict teaching of parents and teachers, perhaps the main factors that damage the health of middle school students can be solved! Thus,</p>
<h3 id="e226">An Introduction to "World Cultural History" <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Originally written by Thorndike, translated by Ni Shoumin, published by World Publishing</p>
<p>The work of discovering, collecting, and organizing world culture is indeed a very important and very difficult task. Often a scholar exhausts his life's energy to study the ancient culture of a certain era in a certain place, exhausting his mind and body, and giving his all, but the results still need successors to continue the struggle, but we still cannot get a final conclusion. In Europe and the United States, there are more scholars dedicated to this work, and in China, it can be said to be extremely rare. Because European and American scholars are diligently engaged in this, the part about Europe and the United States in a current world cultural history is still substantial, while the part about the Far East, especially China, has become a world mystery. For example, Karl Marx had a fairly thorough understanding of the social systems of Europe and the United States, from primitive times to modern times, but he was vague about the East. In his helplessness, he named the Eastern mode of production the Asian mode of production. In his original case, it was because of a lack of textual materials, but the general Chinese people who idolize Marx regard it as a guideline and unknowingly fall into a dead end. Therefore, in world cultural history, the part about China's primitive era is still a blank sheet of paper, and this work needs to be completed by our Chinese people who live and eat here.</p>
<p>Lynn Thorndike's World Cultural History not only has many broad explanations for the part about Europe, but also recognizes the importance of Far Eastern culture extremely strongly. He said: "In our opinion, modern culture mainly belongs to Europe and the Americas, but to observe culture as a whole, the various great cultures of the Far East are absolutely not to be ignored. Therefore, in this book, we have discussed them themselves and their relationship with the West."</p>
<p>However, although Mr. Thorndike made a grand wish for the importance of Far Eastern culture, his efforts are obviously the initial efforts of pioneering and struggling. He still cannot deeply understand the ancient culture of China, but this cannot be blamed on him, because various conditions limit him from having great discoveries, and this responsibility should still be borne by us.</p>
<p>However, from the whole book, it cannot but be said that it is a fairly complete and concise world cultural history. Now I will record its contents briefly as follows: The first part is prehistoric culture and primitive culture; the second part is the development of ancient culture in the Near East; the third part is classical culture and its decline; the fourth part is Far Eastern culture; the fifth part is medieval Near Eastern culture; the sixth part is the revival of Western culture; the seventh part is the early modern period; the eighth part is the origin of modern culture. Each part is divided into chapters and sections. Mr. Ni Shoumin's translation is also clear, smooth, and fluent, making it very easy to read. Finally, there is a table of major cultural events, from the Paleolithic Age to 1925, listing the important events of each year one by one, which is very convenient to consult. The whole book has 634 pages and more than 100,000 words. It is published by World Book Company and priced at three yuan. I hereby introduce this book to readers.</p>

<h3 id="e227">"Chinese Women Are Very Free" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Following her "Birth Control" speech, Mrs. Martin delivered another speech at the Bankers' Club on the evening of the 7th: "The Question of Women's Suffrage."</p>
<p>According to the China Eastern News Agency, "Her speech detailed the status of women in England from the era of Queen Victoria to the end of the European War." When speaking about Chinese women, she said, "Chinese women are very free and obtained suffrage without much struggle. However, from my observation, this excessive freedom leads to a lack of coordination. If true equality is desired, a substantial and effective struggle and unity are necessary."</p>
<p>In the current situation of "the husband gaining status through his wife" and "the wife gaining honor through her husband," it seems that "Chinese women" are indeed "very free." However, these "very free" "Chinese women" are limited to the wives or daughters of "prominent figures." Not only do they have so-called "suffrage," but their material enjoyment is beyond the dreams of Chinese working women, not to mention the working women of England, where they supposedly enjoy "complete equality in political and economic work." They form a privileged class among "Chinese women," just as their "prominent" husbands form a privileged class among Chinese men.</p>
<p>Bebel, in the preface to his great work "Woman and Socialism," said: "Within the current society, women participating in the movement to improve the status of women, and men supporting this movement, often regard women's attainment of full equal civil rights as the ultimate goal. However, even if these bourgeois advocates of suffrage achieve their goals, even if gender equality can be realized, the sexual enslavement of women and the economic dependence of wives cannot be broken. For the majority of women, higher education and high-level professions for the relatively fortunate thousands of their own sex are issues unrelated to themselves. The improvement of the status of a few thousand fortunate women can never improve the general condition of all women."</p>
<p>"Therefore, our goal is not the equality between men and women under the current social system, which is the sole aim of the bourgeois women's movement, but the liberation of humanity from subordination between human beings—that is, between women and men. This solution to the women's question is consistent with the solution to the social question."</p>
<p>Have "Chinese women" already obtained full and equal civil rights? One need only look at the facts to find the answer. And in such a pitiful state, aren't there still people shouting "Women, return to the home!" "Women, return to the kitchen!"? Aren't there "prominent ladies" leading women's organizations who agree with such claims? And doesn't Mrs. Martin, who is always in line with "prominent ladies," also say that she "now has plans to work hard in specialized knowledge and technology such as architecture, because this kind of construction work is especially suitable for women compared to men, such as gardens, houses, kitchens, and toilet facilities, all of which are closest to women's individuality"?</p>
<p>However, although some people are organizing so-called "Motherhood Associations," trying to confine the female masses within the so-called "divine duty" of being good wives and mothers, the fact is that the majority of awakened "Chinese women" will no longer listen to these lies!</p>
<p>"Chinese women are very free"! This is certainly not the case at present, but I am confident that as long as they unite with those who share their fate and move forward together on the path they should take, the day of "very free" will not be far off!</p>
<h3 id="e228">Chives <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Living in the French Concession has many advantages: the air is clean, and the environment is quiet, unlike the noisy lanes of the Public Concession, which are unbearable day and night. However, there is one very inconvenient thing here: it is really not easy to solve the problem of two meals a day. Although there are many Russian restaurants, one can easily tire of the flavors, and they are not very economical. I now live in a lane on Route Lafayette, and I am fortunate that the landlord is willing to provide two meals a day. This not only solves many problems, but what makes me even happier is that I can eat various fresh vegetables every day.</p>
<p>In my hometown, vegetables are the main dishes for three meals a day, all picked fresh from the garden for each meal. Although they may lack richness, the unique fresh and tender taste is something that people who eat delicacies and meat all day long cannot imagine. My love for vegetables may have been cultivated by this rural environment. Among the spring vegetables, my favorite is chives, which have a fragrant, tender, fresh, and sweet flavor. There is a saying in my hometown that evaluates chives: "Fragrant in spring, spicy in summer, old and astringent in autumn." This can be said to be very accurate. My family's garden also had a corner dedicated to growing chives, but my mother never allowed me to eat too much. I never understood the reason, perhaps because of her obsession with cleanliness. She considered anything with a slightly strong nature to be bad, for example, she never allowed me to touch anything sour or spicy.</p>
<p>Originally, although chives are said to be extremely delicious, eating too many of them does make the breath pungent and a little inelegant, which may be offensive to people in social situations. However, considering my current lonely life, this concern is really unnecessary. Why bother with affectation?</p>
<p>The yellow chives sold in Shanghai markets are very popular. I always feel that these yellow chives have enough tenderness, but the taste is too strong, losing the pure and mellow flavor. Yellow chives were originally a delicacy for ancient vegetarians. Lu You's poem has the line: "Chicken feet are suitable with bamboo shoots, pork shoulder mixed with yellow chives." And the elegant anecdote of "cutting spring chives in the night rain" to treat old friends is even more fascinating. As for the rivalry between Shi Chong and Wang Kai of the Jin Dynasty, where they used wheat seedlings mixed with chive roots as a vegetarian offering to guests, vying for a moment of victory, it is enough to generally see how much the ancients treasured</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>yellow chives. But in my opinion, the yellow chives sold in Shanghai markets may be different from what the ancients said. The Ben Cao says: "The root of chives is called yellow chives, the beauty of chives lies in the yellow, which is treasured by the wealthy." The yellow referred to here is actually the white part of the chives that people in my hometown talk about, not necessarily the yellow chives seen in Shanghai markets. These yellow chives are rarely seen in my hometown, because the taste is too strong and not liked by people. The planting method involves cutting off the chive leaves at the root and covering them with rice straw, so that the emerging shoots do not see sunlight. The method of planting white chives in my hometown is to cover the cut chive roots with a high layer of rice ash and then water them with fertilizer. Stir-fried noodles with white chives is one of the popular delicacies in my hometown. The weather in Lingnan is warm, and new wheat flour is already on the market in the second month of spring. The stir-fried noodles with chives, a local seasonal flavor in restaurants, are also available. Now, the market is flooded with foreign flour, and local wheat noodles have been almost completely eliminated. It is said that only one old noodle shop in the county town still sells noodles made with local wheat flour, but most people tend to prefer novelty, and the customers who patronize it are probably limited to those who know how to appreciate the taste.</p>
<p>Although my family has a few acres of land, the two seasons of planting a year are still not enough for the food of a family of thirteen or fourteen. Fortunately, due to the soil and climate, various grains can still be grown, and two or three shi of wheat can be harvested during the year. This bit of wheat is only for our own consumption. On the day the wheat flour is ground and carried back, we naturally have to make noodles to taste the new harvest, and stir-fried noodles with chives are indispensable. However, in my hometown, eating noodles is just a snack. Returning to Shanghai, it has been three years again. Thinking of my hometown because of things, my feelings are naturally deeper and longer. When will I be able to eat stir-fried noodles with chives again? Thinking of this, I can't help but feel disheartened.</p>

Unexpectedly, his daughter returns home triumphantly. That Xiugu is, smiling with a handbag. She then, recounts the intricate details. Shoufeng is, listening and secretly pleased. He is worthy of, the yellow-shirted knight with the beautiful beard. Xiugu is, majestic. So impressive. Completely different from before. He only, bid farewell to the neighbor in the same courtyard. Saying that I, have entrusted my life to a good match. Today is, leaving Beijing in a daze. Therefore, not waiting for a word of farewell, too hasty.</p>

<p>— Illustration by Wan Chao Chen, Explanation by Xin Xin</p>
<p>Helmer: Can't we live together like brother and sister?</p>
<p>Nora: You know that kind of arrangement won't last. Goodbye, Torvald.</p>
<p>Helmer: No matter what, you are still my wife.</p>
<p>Nora: I heard people say that a woman like me who leaves her husband's house, her husband can completely ignore her. I have nothing to do with you, and you have nothing to do with me. Both sides have complete freedom. Take it, this is your ring. Give me mine back. After I leave tomorrow, Christine will come to take the things I brought from home.</p>
<p>Helmer: If you are ever in need, can I help you a little?</p>
<p>Nora: No. I cannot accept help from strangers.</p>
<p>Helmer: Am I just a stranger to you?</p>
<p>Nora: (Picking up the package) Torvald, that has to wait. The miracle of miracles must happen.</p>
<p>Helmer: Tell me, what do you call "the miracle of miracles"?</p>
<p>Nora: It needs to change to the point where our life together can be considered a true marriage. Goodbye!</p>
<p>She walks out of the outer hall. (The End)</p>
