<h3>國際義務之限度問題</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自對意制裁失效歐洲各國於集體和平已失信心撤消對意制裁及修改國聯盟的二事成爲本月杪國聯臨時大會之主要問題而倫敦各報近日乃肆談國際義務之限度問題自由黨之新聞紀事報日現行制裁辦法一旦撤銷之後英國政府在萊茵河畔與在地中海所當負担之義務卽可加以確定其在歐洲他處所當負担之義務亦可予以放棄保守黨之晨郵報則曰爲今之計關係各國所能担負之軍事義務自當確定其程度易言之卽關係各國必在何項地帶始準備作戰務須明白予以指定觀此種論調則英國之無意於集體和平僅希望局部之苟安其態度已甚朋顯</p>
<p>然局部和平果可能乎有限度之國際義務果有效乎萊茵爲英國之邊境此鮑爾特溫之名言也直布羅陀經蘇彝士至印度爲英帝國之生命錢此加爾文之警語也英人欲保此邊境之和平取得此生命錢之安全所應接觸者爲法爲德爲俄爲意此四國者世界之大國也而非歐洲西隅或地中海一隅之國家也目前之和平問題不在於萊茵之一寸土地中海之一顆島換言之和平者世界之問題也整個之問題也譬如德俄在東歐有所衝突英國以烏克蘭與彼無切膚之關係未始不欲嚴守中立然俄與法盟俄被侵則法德必入戰爭狀態萊茵地帶之和平又安在英國欲不盡義務其可得乎</p>
<p>况英國非單一國家不但殖民地佈滿全球其自治領諸邦已蔚成大國惟有整個的和平普遍的安全始可以使帝國之維繫不致割斷不然加拿大澳洲南非諸郭爲本身安全計勢必各自爲謀帝國其能免於瓦解乎夫就倫敦而言遺兵遠東或派艦隊至非洲不免勞師製遠無利有害然就澳洲及南非諸邦言之當英國用兵於萊茵之際澳洲南非之軍隊遠征歐陸以助母國豈非受愚之甚至言經濟制裁如其性質非全世界的而爲英帝國局部之行動則諸自洽領不願受此種經濟上之損失蓋可斷言要知普遍的集體和平爲維繫帝國之唯一良劑有違此義諸邦於倫敦之政策將不表示熱心與贊助矣</p>
<p>目前和平問題之困難在於諸國所負國際義務之過微在於諾國對於國際條的之不忠今因一度之失敗卽併此國際義務亦放棄之併此國際條的亦鄙視之亦可謂不智之甚語曰人無遠慮必有近憂今遠東之和平已達最嚴重之階段香港新加坡一帶極易受到侵略威脅英國欲限制其國際義務又安可得乎</p>

<h3>科學業談</h3>
<p>— 中國科學社主編</p>
<p>蝗　杏邨</p>
<p>蝗蟲爲我國一種農業上極重耍的害蟲。民國十六年山東省蝗蟲爲害。災民數目達七百萬。民國十八年·江蘇·安徽·山東數省。沿海及湖地之蘆葦。因蝗蟲而受的損失。的値一萬萬元左右。又據實業部中央農業實騐所民國二十二年的調查。該年全國蝗蟲爲害作物的面積。計六百八十六萬三千零三十三畝。的値國幣一千四百七十七萬九千二百十三元。每畝平均損失國幣二元左右。</p>
<p>蝗蟲之識別　蝗蟲屬於昆蟲綱·直翅目·蝗蟲科。具有一對堅强的牙齒。（在昆蟲學上稱做大顎。）爲食害植物的武器。蝗蟲和一般蚱蜢不同的地方。在其翅膀很長。的超過腹端三分之一。普通蚱蜢的翅長。不及腹端。或僅較腹部略長。</p>
<p>蝗蟲化生說之謬誤在幾百年前有些牛物學家。以及現在許多沒有生物學知識的人。認生物是由無生物變成的。卽所謂生物的自然發生說。後來經過許多生物學家如李迪Redi司派勞祥立Spallauznni唐德耳Tyndall和巴斯德Pasteur等氏用實騐方法加以證明。這種不正確的說法。才沒有立足餘地。關於蝗蟲的發生。在我國也有同類的傳說。例如謂蝗蟲可由草子，半糞等物變成。又說魚子和蝦子可以變蝗。此皆由於臆測。或不正確的觀察所造成的。</p>
<p>蝗之一生蝗蟲是具有漸進變態的昆蟲。卽在其發育期中。經過卵，稚虫（俗虫跳蝻）和成虫（蝗）三個時期。蝗蟲每年發生二代。（有時發生二代半）以卵期越冬。（蝗卵產在土中成塊狀。每一卵塊裹。包括的卵數。自數枚至一百餘枚不等。）跳蝻體小翅短。脫皮五决。漸見長大。遂變爲飛蝗。</p>
<p>蝗蟲和跳蝻皆嗜食禾本科植物。（跳蝻所食植物。往往較柔嫩。）最喜食的爲蘆　·稻葉·高粱·粟葉·玉蜀黍葉·及莖·和牧草葉。不常食的。爲馬鉿薯葉。烟草葉。瓜類葉。和萵苣葉等。但至食料缺乏時。卽橋梁亦所不擇。因爲蝗蟲最愛食蘆葦。所以在我國自河北省起至江蘇省北的沿海一帶。黃河·淤黃河·淮河等河流的兩岸。長江和錢塘江下游的兩岸。微山湖。洪澤湖等湖泊的周圍。皆爲蝗蟲常常發生的區域。（此等地帶皆富有蘆葦。）</p>
<p>跳蝻有成羣遷徙的習性。但不能飛翔。其遷徙方向。以日光爲斷。故早晨向東。午後向西。遷徙的原因。由於趨光性和趨熱性所造成。成羣的原因。由於成蟲所產卵塊密集一處。蜉化後的跳蝻。也就自然密集而爲一小羣。在遷徙的時候。相鄰的小羣。彼此驚擾。遂相合而爲一大羣。飛蝗也有成羣遷徙的習性。因具有發達的翅。故能遠飛。蝗羣裹個體的數目很多。因此所過之處。田禾大受損害。所以明朝郭敦做的飛蝗詩。「飛蝗蔽空日無色。野老田中淚垂血。牽衣頓足捕不能。大葉全空小枝折。」其爲害劇烈的程度。可見一斑了。蝗蟲飛徙的速度。據薛都Sydow的研究。每四小時可行一德里。的合華里十二里。至於遷徙的原因。有人謂由於外界因子的影響。如因食物缺乏。而從事遷徙。以尋覓食物。但此說極不可信。比較近理的。當爲生理方面的解釋。因蝗蟲雖已達成蟲時期。但其性器官必俟若干日後。始能成熟。潑斯皮洛夫氏Psspelov說。如果一個性器官尚未達成熟的蝗蟲。從事遠徙後。足以促成性器官的早熟。原因時當飛蝗飛翔時。體溫增高。致脂肪和其他儲藏養料的養化作用增强。間接增加性器官在發育上所需的材料。</p>
<p>蝗蟲之消長蝗蟲爲害的記載。在我國古書上數見不鮮。我們如果就以往的記載。仔細檢查一下。便可明白蝗蟲並非連年成災的。大的每經五六年至十二年才大發生一决。可見蝗蟲之大發生。是有周期性的。現在有一般昆蟲學家如尤佛洛夫氏　Uvarov　等。對於這種現象的解釋。認蝗蟲本身可分爲蝗蟲型和蚱蜢型。這兩個型是可以互相變幻的。當環境適宜的時候。蚱蜢型可變爲蝗蟲型。蝗蟲型是可以成羣遠徙而爲大害的。反之。當環境不適宜的時候。蝗蟲型又可變爲蚱蜢型。蚱蜢型是不能成羣遠徙。且不致成災的。因爲由蚱蜢型變成蝗蟲型。中間要經過相當時間。所以顯然有週期性了。</p>
<p>蝗蟲之分佈。據中央農業實騐所民國二十三年的統計。該年蝗蟲在我國的分佈區域。計有江蘇，安徽，山東，河南，山西，浙江，湖南，陝西，河北，九省及南京市。包括有二百六十五縣。在地理上之分佈。南北在北緯三十度（浙江上虞）至四十一度（河北昌平）之間。東西在東經一百零七度半（陝西扶風）至一百二十一度半（江蘇啟東）之間。以地勢而論。蝗蟲分佈以海㧞五十公尺以下之地（如江蘇安徽河北浙江山東等省之產蟲區）爲最多。蝗蟲常因各地氣候因子的影響。在分佈上有數目多寡的不同。鄒鍾琳先生曾依照我國蝗蟲發生地氣候情形及受害輕重。劃分爲三個區域。　適生區。此區域裹之全年平均等溫度在攝氏表十二度以上。平均等雨量在400-800公釐以上。在平常蝗蟲未達大發生的年代。亦可從此區域裹尋出蝗蟲的蹤跡。設遇氣候適宜之年。則個體數目增多而爲大害。且能遠徙至相鄰各地。我國北自河北省之安新縣。南至安徽東部的臨淮關等地方。皆屬於這個區域。　偶災區。此區位置在適生區之外。因南北方向。致氣候情形略有不同。在適生區以北的部分。全年平均等溫度爲10-1200。在適住區以南的部分。全年平均等雨量爲800-1000公釐。旺年時受適生區飛來蝗蟲的損害。但非連年發生蝗患。　不活躍區。此區更在偶災區以外。其北部之全年平均等溫度爲1000以下。南部之全年平均等雨量爲1000公釐以上。通常蝗患極少。</p>
<p>蝗蟲之天敵蝗蟲雖爲人類之大敵。但在自然界裹蝗蟲自己也有天然敵害。例如我們在野外有時看見許多蝗蟲或跳蝻。緊抱在蘆葦共他植物上。仔細檢查。皆已成死的屍體。鄉人稱之爲吊死瘟。蓋因被一種專門寄生在見蟲體內的病菌所寄生。這種寄生菌必須當雨量多空氣濕的時候。才能够活動。所以在乾燥的空氣裹。吊死瘟是不易發見的。蝗蟲有時也被其他昆蟲所殘殺。例如寄生在蝗蟲體內的有麻蠅和蝗（亦爲一種蠅）的幼蟲。專以蝗體內之組織爲食。以蝗卵爲食的有長吻　（一種蠅）和莞書（一種甲蟲）的幼蟲。以跳蟲爲食的有黃蜂，盜蠅，和細腰蜂等。烏類中也有食害蝗蟲的。例如鸛，鷗，鴉，鵲，杜鵲，鷓鴣，麻雀鷦鷯，百靈，山烏，松雞，怪鴟鵲，貓頭鷹等。此外如鴨亦喜食跳蝻。故有人放鴨便　啄食跳蝻。</p>
<p>蝗之防治　治蟲一事應當不失時效。例如在跳蝻時期翅膀尚未長成。不能飛翔。捕殺極其便利。設一味遷延時日。不事撲滅跳蝻。一旦變成飛蝗。卽將遠走高飛。不易處治了。又蝗蟲是具有遷徙性的。所以產蝗各省。皆應努力除蝗。以收通力合作之效。關於治蝗的方法。說來話長。而且也太瑣碎。在這裹限於篇幅。也不必贅述了。但有一點在治蝗方面很關重要。卽蝗蟲發生的地方。多屬荒地。原因是在這些荒地裹。終歲荒蕪。不經耕鋤等工作。致蝗蟲所產的卵。可在土中安然越冬。决年得以孵化。如果我們把所有荒地。盡行開懇。致蝗子或被耕鋤而死。或因翻出土而爲鳥類或獸類所取食。或爲冬季嚴寒所凍死。這樣便自然可以减少次年蝗蟲的爲害。美國落磯山的飛蝗。從前爲害很烈。自從開墾以後。便减少而不爲大患。可見開墾和治蝗是具有極秘密的關係。</p>
<p>蝗蟲之利用　我們耗去了很多的人工。所捕得的蝗蝻。爲數甚巨。應當設法加以利用。據盧蒲博士Dr.　J.　H.　Roop分析新鮮的蝗蟲。其結果含有下列成分。卽水分68.4%，脂肪1.94%，蛋白質25.07%，織維3.41%，灰分1.24%，故蝗蟲頗宜於飼育家畜或家禽之用。放鴨啄食跳蝻。確係一舉兩得。又據美國哈耳拍爾博士Dr.　D.　N.　Harper分析蝗1蟲。在肥料學的觀點上。具有窒素10.7，溶解的磷酸1.52%。未溶解的磷酸.24%。所以蝗蝻屍體爲一種有效的肥料。可利用以培養作物。</p>

<h3>國民經濟建設實施方案之商確</h3>
<p>— 祝平</p>
<p>一·引言</p>
<p>在蘇俄第一五年計劃實行之翌年，余方游學英倫，就倫敦大學教授邁决道夫（A　mengendarff）研討各國土地政策，邁氏爲帝俄遺冑，前聖彼得大學土地法教授及帝俄國會　Duma　之副議長也；故於俄國經濟情况至爲瞭悉，余等在商討土地政策之餘，間嘗論及蘇俄九年計劃之實施情狀，斯時五年計劃實行未久，各國學者每多目爲空想而加以冷嘲熱笑，絕少有予以重視者，顧余睹其計劃本身周詳縝密，絕非紙上空談者可此，而共制度舆方法，尤爲生產落後國家發展經濟建設之唯一途徑，蓋以生產落後之國家，若不以整個國家爲單位，在經濟建設上爲有組織有計劃之推進，則其經濟之發展將永無趕上產業先進國之一日也，因此余於蘇俄九年計劃之演進，特予以注視，舉凡公私方面之記載，以及各方批判之論著，糜勿悉心搜集，以作參考之资料。</p>
<p>是年冬，余應倫敦留學界之邀，在本黨駐倫敦支部作公開講演，講題即爲「蘇俄九年實業建設計劃，」除將平時探究所得作有系統之叙述外，對於計劃經濟制度之本身，頗多好評，當時曾因此引起一部份同志之責難，蓋以其時一般人對於蘇俄五年計劃之本身認識尚淺，每多以五年計劃與共產主義相提並論，故不免談虎而色變也。</p>
<p>嗣後余由英赴德，因悉德國一般學者對於計劃經濟之興趣，較英倫爲濃，開於蘇俄九年計劃之記載與評述，亦視英倫爲　于參考資料之蒐集，益爲便利矣。</p>
<p>返國後，目睹吾國現狀，益信計劃經濟之實施爲吾國經濟發展之唯一途徑去春蔣委員長倡導國民經濟建設運動，實爲吾國經濟建設指示一光明之坦道，而個人對於計劃經濟之信念，乃復益堅，本年五月中旬，余奉命出席行政院地方高級行政人昌會議時，對於國民經濟建設問題，曾力主應由中央規定具體辦法，通飭各地切實推行，嗣後又奉蔣委員長召見，當時除述職以外，復將平日對於國民經濟建設之管見詳爲陳述，頗蒙蔣委員長之垂納，兹值蔣委昌長戳力推進國民經濟建設運動之際，爰不辭固陋，將此稿刊佈藉求各方專家之指正。</p>
<p>二．國民經濟建設之途徑　統制經濟乎？　抑計劃經濟？</p>
<p>吾國今日實施國民經濟建設，其應採之途徑如何，时實爲目前首先應解决之問題，邇來統制經濟之說甚囂塵上，意者統制經濟即爲吾國國民經濟建設之途徑乎？鄙見以爲吾國國民經濟之建設，不應採統制經濟之途徑，而應採計劃經濟之途徑，計劃經濟與統制經濟，在形態上雖屬相似，而在本質上，則迴然不同，茲說明如次：</p>
<p>一·計劃經濟與統制經濟之分野　計劃經沸爲積極的經濟政策，乃一種新的合理的經濟形態，實施計劃經濟，須將整個國民經濟，如生產，交换，分配及消費諸方面，都製成彼此之聯系精密計劃，此項計畫，由政府加以集中統制，使國民經濟活動，成爲有機構成體，實施計劃經濟之國家，其國民經濟之動向，以計劃爲體，統制爲用，以統制之手段達到計劃之目的。至於統制經濟則爲消極的經濟政策，仍資本主義發展到最後階段之國家，爲解除其不可避免的經濟發生之矛盾，維持其原有之經濟制度而產生的一種補救之辦法，所以在本質上是與計劃經濟根本不同。</p>
<p>二·我國所需要者爲計劃經濟中國經濟發展，尚未達到現代資本主義國家之水準，同時帝國主義經濟勢力，籠罩着我國整個國民經濟，使吾人呻吟於外來資本主義的桎梏之下而不克解脫。因此，吾人對於原有之經濟制度，無所用其顧恤，亦無所用其維持與補救，故吾人爲要突破舊有制度之牢籠，找求吾人之出路，不需要修補式之統制經濟　維持舊經濟制度，而是要積極的創造的根據民族環境之需要，而建立一種三民主義的計劃經濟制度，且民生主義經濟政策，爲站在整個民族經濟平等之立塲，謀國民經濟之發展，實施三民主義的計劃經濟：一方面經濟建設有集中之統制，作有計劃推進，使生產得到合理的迅速的發展，另方面生產之結果，不致受少數人之支配與壟斷，在分配上自能得到公平之享受。故欲發展吾國國民經濟捨實行計劃經濟外實無他途也。</p>
<p>三·國民經濟建設計劃規訂之步驟</p>
<p>國民經濟之建設計劃之規訂，共第一步驟，須將原有經濟組織與生產單位——凡從事於經濟活動之個體，均視爲生產單位，如工廠·工塲·商店·田莊·以及金融運輸交通機關等——予以適當之組織，使相同之生產單位，爲密切之結合，成爲有機之　成體，蓋必先具有此項基本之組織，然後一切經濟情形，與生產狀況之調查與統計，方有可靠之來源，經濟計劃之設定，方有確切之依據，而整個計劃之推進，方能如身之使臂，臂之使指，運用自如也。</p>
<p>生產單位組織就緒後，由中央計劃機關報據各生產單位之具體報告，（每一生產單位應將其生產狀況乃經濟情形作成詳細報告呈送中央計劃機關，例如每一工廠應將其資本數額勞工人數機器種類及件數每年產量行銷區域及盈虧情形等詳細具報？依照國民經濟建設之原則，製成國民經濟建設之初步綱領，逐級發交各地方及各生產單位飭令遵照綱領原則各就實際情形，製成各地方及各生產單位之生產計劃呈送中央，復由中央　　此項生產計劃，予以總合整理斟酌緩急輕重，調整其相互關係，確定其系統與程序，製成整個國民經濟建設計劃，然後逐級頒發各地方及各生產單位，各就計劃中所規定其本身應負之任務，分別負責進行，如是按程計功，循序邁進，國民經濟建設計劃之實現，可操左券也。</p>

<p>合拍照片</p>
<p>現已將照片呈案、被訴敎唆殺唐案、實在冤枉、庭上詰其照片可以偽告拚　、唐於六月十八日被害、你敎唆他人、亦可於前數日通知成事、王則極口呼冤、並稱與唐並無怨仇、何故要敎唆他人殺害他、更不能叫趙廣福去殺人、問、你有無拜過師父收徒弟之事、矢口不認、以前曾拜過孫傳芳部下副官司時仁為先生、倘張廷桂　是我徒弟、我</p>
<p>死亦無怨</p>
<p>問、與顧衝軒認識否、答、係同鄉、見過一面、不與往來、至此庭上命提告發人監犯趙廣福到案、令鈔文稿一紙、并令具結後、訊據趙供、王興高與　金奎實係二個人、我實由在逃這周　木匠叫去、與王興高絲毫無、在牢監內與薛翼一同商議詐財告發王興高、現在憑</p>
<p>良心說話</p>
<p>經庭上賂趙一再盤詰、供詞閃鑠、庭上又侖提　遷桂到案、張供不認是王興高之徒弟、敎唆殺死唐嘉鵬者、實係在逃之王金奎、王之兩面頰上有疤痕、并稱在看守處取得存摺一個、計數二千元、叫我翻供告發顧竹軒、由趙廣福指使證明、共同詐財、我已經吃了官司、要錢何用、故拒絕、并即告發、訊至最後、庭上命提顧置到案作證、顧供、王興高係同鄉、偶然碰見過、并不往來、不知王金奎是</p>
<p>何等樣人</p>
<p>亦非我之徒弟、訊顧兇手供出爾在大江南旅館與兇手等等會見時、敎唆殺人時情形、顧供絕無其事、問、旣無此事、爾於王興高被捕時、何故往梖州去、顧答、杭州地方、我有荘子那裏、不時常往居住的等語、官又訊問王興高一過、以案情已審訊明瞭、經警備處律師顧過熙與上訴人之馬　吳三辯護律師毒相辯論後、庭上　宣告終結、定期廿六　下午二時宣判、上訴人與提案證人各犯、仍退庭時、已下午一點半矣、顧衝軒之上訴案、於下午審訊顧之胞兄松茂、妻妾　氏蔡氏、親戚鄭緘三及與案有關之看守主任吳驚、看守馬憲　祥、原告發犯人趙廣福張廷桂等、亦皆傳提到案、質訊至午後三點另五分、仍由朱遷長偕王廖兩推事、會同趙首席檢察官伍書記官司等、蒞第一刑庭審訊、警務處由姚肇　律師代表出庭、上訴人所遷之辯護律師三人、亦凖時到庭、　庭後、官命提上訴人顧竹置至案、先訊年籍住址職　後、</p>
<p>庭上宣告</p>
<p>本案重　辯論、更新審理、命顧陳述上訴理由、顧稱患病已久、手足個腫、請求賜坐　訊、官論待訊問爾話完畢後、可以就坐、顧乃供本人向來沒有殺過人、與趙廣福張廷桂并不相識、亞洲飯店大江南旅館、均未去過、趙等要敲詐我金錢、故誣攀我、他們曾經敲詐過徐昌榮等、問、旣無敎唆殺人事、　何以到杭州去、　、到杭州那裏我自已有荘子、不時去的、并非是逃走、</p>
<p>實在冤枉</p>
<p>、請求伸冤、問、你說趙廠詐你、那時有幾封信、何不即告發、直至警務睡拘到你後、方才提出來、此種信非單純要錢的信、不與計較還可說、事關人命、何等重要、豈不為自己着想、答、那时我有病在普慈醫院內醫　、由家屬接到信、以伊等已判無期徒刑、與二十年刑期、不知從何送錢到牢監裏去、但親戚鄭緘三、見信說過、主張要追究、那時家裏人</p>
<p>因我有病</p>
<p>、亦不追究、這就是家裏人錯誤、我因任保衛團長坐汽車赴市政府去、中途碰傷、在普慈醫院治、出院才五天、接到法　拘票、拘我到案、我開天蟾與上毫無抵觸、實係有人要加害我、我現在亦說不出冤家是誰、那一個發傳單投匿名信、都是一個人做的、假是十個人說我有嫌疑、亦要有證據、趙等說我殺人、以前說過我一起有八個人在塲會議的、請求澈底調伸雪、如查有一點證據、</p>
<p>我願領罪</p>

<h3>證劵　多頭大量出籠</h3>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市價轉跌甚鉅、隔日收盤、四十七號等狂事吸收抵補、昨日消息轉劣、適懷相反、四十七號等、迅即轉事賣出、時局固變動莫測、但以場上之多頭爭相出籠、大戶甚至翻空、本月多頭　覺恐慌、下週一為六月份期貨最後一天、查戊甲兩種、實貨交出最多、故軋多必較其他各種為烈、幸尚在連同六個月息在內、八月份上塲、彼時已皆除息、價必當更低也、昨日經過、開盤以消息與隔日相反、誤進者從事吐出、老多頭漸漸出籠、與隔日收盤市價、適得其反、　號四十七號等瀉出、市價一致趨跌、計小一二角至六七角不等、次盤以四十八號繼續抵進、四十七雖續有賣出、前列大都回上二三角、甲乙種依然平疲、午後開盤、多方出　更湧、十一吾民亦爭先賣出、午後開盤、多方出　更湧、十一號亦爭先賣出、市價復轉下游、又小五分一角至三角半、收盤五十九號忽有大量賣出、四號十一號繼績賣出、市價仍不克維持、形成軋多、甲種本月份猛小六角為最多、餘亦未有振作、環境消息、暫時未有轉機、　面則因虛軟、軋多勢將不免、市價結果、計一致跌落三五角至一元半不等、成交總數、共計九七七〇〇元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　交貨籌碼不充</h3>
<p>近期花猛漲元餘</p>
<p>—世界紗花頻漲不已—</p>
<p>棉市步緊、且漲風甚狂、蓋以近期陳花以交貨籌碼缺乏、軋空甚力、市價猛漲、形勢非常緊張、一般浮空皆現　　失措之狀、七月期高峰會達四十六元五角、發現四月十四日後之新高價矣、</p>
<p>陳棉出六元關</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、以美棉陳花大漲、印棉亦緊挺、大阪三品花本月份軋空飛漲三元九角半、而空方對於本月份缺乏籌碼交解、浮空恐慌抵補、近月跳高、開盤氣勢殊形俏俐、市價步開頻挺、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲四·五·六角、午後開盤、本月又跳三角、遠月平平、新花反趨下落、二三盤尚堅定、迨至收盤、六·七兩個月賣者稀少、形　汹猛、一　穿出六元關外、七月巴達六元半、八月份尚未漲破六元關外、結果陳花比上午收盤價均漲二·六·角六角半、新花漲五分及勿動、查賣出大孚三千六百担、通記三千一百担、聚興五千八百担、　記四千一百担、　昌三千四百担、元一六千六百担、泰昌二千四百担恒昌二千六百担、信誠四千二百担、愼記五千三百担、長和一千七百担、吉豊五千八百者、裕大五千六百担、潤康四千三百担、森康六千擔、新昶四千擔、豊泰三千一百担、兹将一日间最高低價及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>標紗隨原棉昂騰</h3>
<p>—廿三日紗交夏節休假—</p>
<p>紗市續漲、局勢挺秀、實綠世界紗花狀况一意上騰、同時原棉狂漲、致唇齒相依之紗市、牽入佳境、惜乎現紗銷場太清、人心未能十分堅昂、漲勢尚屬和緩、不過棉價步貴、成本增高、紗價當能鞏固矣、</p>
<p>金鷄空望紛補</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以海外紗花市價繼續上漲、人心牽動、場中氣見緊、賣戶缺乏、空頭紛紛扒補、同時大阪三品紗亦漲一二元不等、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元至一元一二三八角、惟本月份因賣方交貨、僅漲六角、午後開盤、因現紗生意不暢、人氣平常、各月均跌五六角、但入後鑒於棉花奇昂、紗市被其拉起、迨至三收盤、亦復回上、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一二三四五角、查賣出通記一千三百包、振大一千五百五十包、合興四千九百五十包、豊泰一千四百包、愼記一千五百包、信誠二千六百五十包、達記四各一百五十包、長餘一千一百五十包、永昌一千五百包、買進吉豊一千三百包、梅記一千二百包、恒益二千〇五千包、明德八百五十包、賡豊二千三百包、長豊二千六百五十包、潤康二千七百包、同和一千〇五十包百五十包、裕大一千五百包、大豊一千二百包、茲將一日間最高低價及收盤價列後</p>

<h3>從今天做起！</h3>
<p>— 朱承熙</p>
<p>我們一個人做事，要想着就倣，「從今天做起」，要是今天等明天，明天等後天，那麼一輩子做不出好事，三翻四覆，結果不外乎「一事無成」。</p>
<p>我們要知道。因循和懶惰，是一條最毒的蛇。我們要除去一個惡習。或是養成一個新的習慣，非有絲毫不變的决心，是永久不能放功的。假使我們有了「今天姑且再做一次、明天起不做了吧！」的念頭或是「明天起再做好了，今天且玩一天吧！」的脾氣，那末壤的習慣，永久不能除去，新的習慣，也永久不能建立，我們要有「從今天做起」的决心。不要以為過了今天。還有明天！</p>
<p>古人說：「過去種種譬如昨日死，未來種種猶如今日生。」我們認為不正當不應該做的事，立刻從今天起不再做，正當而應該做的事，從今天起就開始做。</p>
<p>小朋友！我們是國家未來的主人翁，要是從小不能好好修養，將來怎樣挽救國家的危亡。推進時代的巨輪？</p>
<p>大家記著：「從今天做起！」</p>
<h3>意國小朋友實施防毒訓練</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>意國首相墨索里尼，對於靑年們的軍訓，本來很注意的，而且自去年起，他還編有狼子團Sons　ofthe　Wolf弘f。最近意國雖然已把阿國打敗，要把阿國併入意國版圖，但他鑒於歐洲的風雲日急，所以對於國防問題，另一面也非常注意，尤其是防空問題最是關心了。</p>
<p>在防空聲中，意國的小朋友們，也受到種種訓練，所以最近羅馬的城裏，時常可以看見狼子團團員在街市上面列隊而行。每個人的身上，掛看一個防毒面幕，一有緊急令，他們在迅速的動作之下，便立刻會把面幕套在頭上，把全個面孔蒙住。</p>
<p>狼子團是由墨索里尼一手所造的，團員的年齡，祇限自六歲以上，八歲以下的孩子，才可入伍。因為自八歲起，到十四歲為止，是可以加入幼年團了。孩子們加人狼子團而後，便要穿看黑色的法西斯制服，嚴密的受各種軍事訓練。現在他們的手裏，拿的雖是木槍，但將來都要換眞槍的。總之，現在的狼子團，十幾年後，便是意國最有力的一枝軍隊了。</p>
<h3>怎樣應付會考</h3>
<p>— 菱湖昭</p>
<p>小朋友，光陰如箭，轉瞬一學期又快完結了。而你們最担心的一件事，就是「會考」。「會考」是逃不了的，否則，你須留級，不能升學，多麼可恥啊！</p>
<p>如果平時對於功課稍加注意的，對於「會考」可不必放在心上。否則非要臨時抱佛脚不可。尤其是算學，平時習題做得不多，現在要幹緊做一點，揀重要的做，不必全做，因為時間關係。其次歷史地理亦該多看多記。國文常讀自己做的作文和看報就够了。英文須多讀生字和單句。這樣不致於弄到「一敗塗地」啊！</p>
<p>現在時間頂適宜讀書，天是亮得很早，我們能够早些起身，拿兩本書，筆記簿，不論是客廳，露台，或野外，只要空氣較新鮮的地方都好。祇少可以讀二三小時的書，這時記憶力最台壯，讀書的速率亦較大。古人所謂「一日之計在於晨」便是這個道理。</p>
<p>不過在「會考」舉行前一二天，不宜多讀，應該略為溫習，否則，把腦子弄糊塗了，「會考」時就考不出來。</p>
<p>天是一天熱一天了，我們對於飲食在特別小心，冷東西像酸梅湯，冰淇淋，等少吃為妙。到「會考」時發作起來眞難過極了，所以在夏天對於衛生，不可不留意的。</p>
<p>會考時，不可心惶，先靜聽師長的話，然後下筆做題目，做得出的做，做不出的暫時不做，等全卷做過，再做做不出的！否則，時間不應許你，要弄得「一蹋糊塗」哩！當心！</p>
<h3>一塊泥</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>那天明兒的爹爹在一種一株花，因命明兒做個助手，搬運泥土。花種好了，明兒便問他的爹爹道：「請問，花木與泥土有什麼關係啊？」</p>
<p>明兒的爹爹道：「你且把一小塊泥浸在玻瓶　，明天再告訴你，好嗎？」</p>
<p>過了一夜，他父子倆便同去看那瓶裏的泥，則見泥已明顯地變成一層層的沈澱在瓶底了。明兒的爹爹因指着瓶向明兒說道：「沈在瓶底那一顆顆的粗粒，叫做砂泥。其上較細的，叫做沙粒」</p>
<p>明兒不待他爹爹說完，即揷口問道：「那未，砂泥與沙粒對於種植花木，有什麼用啊？」</p>
<p>明兒的爹爹道：「你且聽我說完了再問。那沙粒上層，不是還有膩膩的東西嗎？這叫做粘土。粘土上最薄的一層，則叫做腐植土。腐植土就是植物的葉兒，根兒等腐化而成的。」</p>
<p>明兒道：「那末粘土呢？」</p>
<p>明兒的爹爹道：「植物也同動物一樣，天天要吃東西，才能生長。粘土中含有礦物質，是植物所最喜的；至於沙料，則其中並沒有礦物質的食物存在着。」</p>
<p>明兒大悟，道：「敎科書中說起沙漠之地，草木不生，想就是這個道理吧。這沙粒眞是討厭的東西啊！」</p>
<p>明兒的爹爹道：「沙粒也不能說它一定討厭，因為凡是可以耕種的地土內，一定有沙粒存在着。泥土之內，含有沙粒，也有好處：它可以使地土變鬆，易於吸水，於種植是有用的。」</p>
<p>明兒聽了他爹爹一番話，高興得什麼似的，因道：「明天我要把這瓶泥帶到學校裏，講給同學聽聽，讓他們得到些常識。」</p>
<h3>爸爸失業了</h3>
<p>— 乃常</p>
<p>苑兒雖然只有八歲，但是因為他的身材高，身體結實，做事的能力也有，所以無形中在小朋友的隊伍裏成了一名小領袖。</p>
<p>可是，今天下午我們碰見他時，他已不像平時那樣的英氣勃勃，面上的笑痕也不知跑到什麼地方去了。我們都跑到他的跟前，有人拉他的手，有人拍他的肩。</p>
<p>「阿苑，做什麼啦，哭喪著臉？」有人這樣問他了。</p>
<p>「沒有什麼！沒有什麼！」他搖著頭。</p>
<p>「為什麼不告訴我們哩？你說好啦！我們做得到一定帮你忙，」</p>
<p>苑兒這才囁嚅的說：爸爸失業了！」</p>
<p>這麼一說，小朋友們却都目瞪口呆，沒話可说了。</p>
<p>以後，我們再不能跟苑兒一同上學了。苑兒每天都帮他媽媽在家裏做活，不久之後，他又跑上街頭去呌賣晚報了。可是我們對苑兒，比以前更尊敬了，他才是一個將來的有用的國民，一個有獨立精神的國民。</p>
<h3>小猴巧坐黄色車</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>卓別靈為什麼不開口？</h3>
<p>— 紫英</p>
<p>卓別靈「摩登時代」早經開映了。看過這片的人都－定有一個疑問：「卓別靈為什麼不開口呢？」</p>
<p>是的，卓別靈從沒有在銀幕上開過口。為什麼呢？這見我就告訴你一個故事吧：</p>
<p>當卓別靈還只十多歲的時候，他徼倖地得了一個雜技團的聘請，到海峽羣島傑塞地方表演，因為島民多不懂英語，對於那些引人發笑的俗話和鄉間土語更莫明其妙了；於是對他們的滑稽表演，簡直是不知所謂！以至營業失敗。後來他們討論研究了很久，只有嘗試以姿態和動作來使觀衆了解他們的意思。這一來，却使他發見一個偉大的秘密—啞劇的力量。</p>
<p>成名之後，他常說：「人類用姿勢（動作）來表示一切，比聲音更能使人深切的瞭解。」又說：「啞劇和默片是世界的語言。」</p>
<p>這麼着，他就一直堅持繼續到而今，不曾在銀幕上開過口。對於卓別靈，我們不應該把他看成一個小丑來取笑，他的藝術理論，也很值得我們注意的。</p>
<h3>組織閱報團</h3>
<p>— 費潔心</p>
<p>俗語說：「秀才不出門，能知天下事。」秀才怎麼會知天下事呢，就是他會看報。</p>
<p>報紙不單是供給國家，國際的軍事，政治，經濟的消息，就是世界上各種新的發現，新的常識，天天有記載的。日新月異，使讀者獲得一種新的眼光，新的知識。它不單是能够激發人們愛國愛民愛人類的情緒，並且能够指示人們走入光明康莊的大道，又可以培養德性，發展思想，是識字的人不能不看的。</p>
<p>記得我小時候，寫着一條「飯不可一日不吃，報不可一日不看」的紙條，貼在書桌面前，用來做我的座右銘，勉勵自己看報。</p>
<p>報紙初拿上手，的確是不大會懂，如果十天念天之後，有了經騐，那就看起來，一天輕鬆一天，興味也就一天濃厚一天，有類似「雅片　」來，欲罷不能的了。</p>
<p>現在我有一個建議：希望在校的小朋友們，組織發個閱報團。每團的人數不拘。各團推選一個團長，主理全團的事務。並請一位敎師做顧問，指導一切。規定全體團員每天必須看申報。（時間和分量不必限定的）到了每天下午，在課外擇定一個相當的時間，會合起來，由顧問指名報告。（名數不必過多，時間共約十分鐘。）並考核各團報告的成績，拿來比較。</p>
<p>這種指名報告法，可以使各團員對於「閱報一項事。負起一種責任的。同時同學間互聽報告之後，也於不知不覺中交換了一種知識，以他人之所知，補自己的不足。眞是「一舉兩得」，何樂而不為呢！</p>
<p>倘有某團員不曾閱報，可以大家訂個公約：罰他今天補看，明天補報告。</p>
<p>這種組織是很有趣味約，小朋友們不妨來試行一下！</p>
<h3>雄雞</h3>
<p>— 亢</p>
<p>老雄雞！老雄雞！</p>
<p>天天黎明喔喔啼，催醒我們早早起。</p>
<p>告訴我們說：「要聰明，要伶俐；莫貪睡，莫遲起。</p>
<p>淸晨吸收好空氣，强身運動也適宜，工作讀書—往往事半功倍；朋友們—切莫錯過好機會！」</p>
<p>啊！可敬可愛的雄雞！</p>
<p>多謝你的美意，天天早晨勤謹啼，不辭勞苦不失時。</p>
<p>願你工作到底，督促我們進取！</p>
<h3>蠶豆莢做成的小船</h3>
<p>— 金知溫</p>
<p>記得我在小時候，每到三四月裏，田裏種着的蠶豆都成熟了？我就和弟弟背着竹筐去摘；當摘了回來的時候，我們就把剝去了豆的豆莢，做成幾隻小船，放在小河裏玩，讓它在水面上飄浮着，樣子怪像黃浦江裏的擺渡船。這玩意兒，一般生長在都市裏的小朋友，恐怕不會知道的吧；但是做法是很簡單的，現在就讓我來告訴你們。</p>
<p>現在正是有蠶豆莢的時候，當你看見媽媽或老媽子在剝蠶豆莢，你就揀幾隻整齊的，把它小心的剝開，（如甲圖、取出豆；再拿幾根折斷的火柴梗，撑在豆莢裏，（如乙圖）每隻撑三根，前後兩根的長短相等，中间一根要長些至於船篷的做法，那更簡單，祇要剪一張正方形的圖畫紙，撑在豆莢的兩邊，（如丙圖）這樣就做成一隻很有趣的小船了。</p>
<p>科學小問題</p>
<h3>牙粉牙膏怎能使牙齒淸潔？</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>只要懂得一些衛生常識的人，不論成人或孩童，恐怕都有每天刷牙的習慣吧。誰却知道用牙粉牙膏刷牙可使牙齒淸潔？我們知道：牙齒的最外層是琺瑯質，非常堅硬，是用來專保護牙齒的。不過琺瑯質雖非常緊硬，但是它都也怕一樣東西，那就是帶酸性的東西。人自然總免不了要吃些東西，像水果裏的酸，牛奶吃後漸漸變成的酸性等等，所以，我們非想法把吃過東西之後，云掉牙齒縫裏剩餘的那類東西。固然若漱口也可以，不過要漱得乾乾凈凈，倒實在不是件容易的事，所以最好的方法，就是用相反的　性的成分，牙粉牙膏有了這樣東西，就可惜牙刷的動作，把牙齒縫裏的汚垢去掉。所以小朋友要使牙齒淸潔，就非養成每天刷牙的習慣不可；要每天刷牙更非用牙粉牙膏不為功。</p>

<h3>木棍與竹桿</h3>
<p>—答廣州，培正中學·張嘉人—</p>
<p>嘉人弟弟：</p>
<p>「童子軍手裏的那條棍子，一定要用木質的嗎？」你這問題的確很有趣味。我們極力贊成中國童子軍手裏的那條棍子，要改用竹棍。因為「竹」是我們中國的特產。並且用起來，比現在的木棍更有力呢。譬如架橋，那竹桿比木棍要實用得多了</p>
<p>這問題連那位發起世界童子軍的貝登堡老哥，也曾提起過—他見了我們上次到丹麥去，出席世界童子軍大會的幾位哥哥，就這樣問：「你們中國童子軍，為什麼不拿竹桿來做棍子呢？」</p>
<p>大約以前我們幾位「學做」童子軍的——，學外國人的大哥們，在還沒有知道那條木棍的用處以前，就「依樣畫葫蘆」的學人家拿木棍罷了。你是知道的：童子軍手裏這一條棍子，决不是一件裝飾品，也不是兵士手中那支來福槍的代替物，我們是要用來做許多「警探」工作的。</p>
<p>你說，你要改用別的材料，那我們十分贊成，贊成你就改用竹捍了我們希整全中國童子軍都會改用竹桿—因為那中價錢便宜又實用的東西。</p>
<p>倘然因為習憤的關係，不便立刻改變——特別是在集團生活中，要求一律的緣故，不好改變。那麼我們然望你自己，至少在個人的野外生活中，除那條木棍，而改用這種中國特產的竹桿</p>
<p>關於中國「竹」的許多智識，希望你自己去查查看植物學辭典中的「竹科」，或問問懂得「竹」的大哥們。我們更喜歡能得到你用竹桿在野外生活中的一張照片。不知可能嗎？不多寫了，祝你像竹桿一般的「節節高」——進步！</p>

<h3>義狗傳（二十三）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>小南洛掙扎着站起身來，雙手抱住了柏德希，喃喃地說道：『什麼都完了！親愛的柏德希！什麼都完了』！</p>
<p>他已餓得全身都沒有氣力，却還勉强振作起來，向村中走回去。柏德希垂頭喪氣的挨着他身旁走，只為又肌餓又憂悶，連它那强有力的四肢也軟下來。</p>
<p>雪下得很大，一陣快刀般的冷風，從北面括來，平原上寂靜如死。他的費了好多的時候，找尋那條走熟了的小路，等到他捫走近村落時，早巳鐘嗚四下了。柏德希忽然嗅到了雪中一種氣味，立刻停住了脚，將脚爪不住的抓着，便從雪堆裏銜出一隻棕色皮質的小袋子來，它在黑暗中抬高了頭，把那袋子交與小南洛。他見近邊一座小十字架下正掛着一盞燈，他把袋子凑在燈光中一瞧，却見上面有柯甘士的名字，打開來瞧時，見有六千法郎的鈔票。</p>
<p>小南洛見了這麼多的鈔票，好生奇怪。他連忙塞在自己的襯衣袋裏拍了拍柏德希的頭，拉着它向進前走去。柏德希莫明其妙的仰着頭對他瞧。</p>
<p>當下小南洛一逕趕往磨坊，直到那磨坊主人柯甘士的住宅門前，在門板上叩了一下。柯甘士夫人哭着開出門來。小愛洛跟在伊的背後，伊眼淚汪汪的　聲說道：「可憐的孩子，可他你嗎？你趕快跑開去，不要給我丈夫瞧見了你。我們今夜正遭到了一件煩惱的專情，因為他剛才騎騎馬回來時，掉下了一個錢袋，他此刻出去找尋了，但是在雪中那裏找尋得到。上帝知道我們失去了這麼一筆錢，怕要破產了。這就為的是我們薄待了你，才受到這樣的報應。」</p>
<p>小南洛把那錢袋放在伊的手中，一面打發柏德希到屋子裏么。他即忙說道：「這錢袋是柏德希今夜所找到的。夫人，請你道樣對柯甘士先生說，並且要求他把柏德希收留下來，可憐它太老了。請你們供給它的吃和住吧。求你們好好地待它，我走時不要放它出來追趕我。</p>
<p>柯甘士夫人來不及說什麼話，小南洛俯下身去和柏德希親了一吻，於是急急的帶上了門，在昏黃的夜色中溜走了。</p>

<h3>今日的巴爾幹半島</h3>
<p>— 佐斌</p>
<p>巴爾幹原來是歐洲列强互相角逐的中心地方，是上决大戰的發源地；素有「國際噴火口」的稱號。大戰以後，半島的形勢雖有些變化，但它的國際關係却更加複雜而且嚴重了，因而就在目前它仍然是國際的主要火藥庫之一。</p>
<p>在目前的巴爾幹半島上的國家，有南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞，保加利亞，希臘，亞爾巴尼亞等。，此外土耳其的一部分領土也在道半島上。這些國家與默洲列强均有深切的關係，因而歐洲列强在這半島上的衝突也分外嚴重和複雜。如英意在希臘的衝突，法意在小協的國與奧匈的矛盾中的鬥爭，德法意在半島上的三角式的矛盾，都可說是非常嚴重而且不可調和的。最近因爲波蘭在小恊約國間的外交活動，德國　濟部長沙赫特的遊說東南歐，意奧匈的外交往來，特別是奧大利的復辟運動的發展，更使得這「國際噴火口」的火熖高漲了起來。</p>
<p>先說德國和波蘭的活動。本來小協的國一向是與法國一致的，最近因法蘇協定的成立，捷克和羅馬尼亞的親蘇，它更成爲了法蘇集團的一員。這在德國和波蘭不消說是很不快意的；希特勒除以淮兵萊茵河來同答這件事情外，並努力設法向巴爾幹活動，企圖分散小協的國的團集。道件事情的具體表現，首先便是最近波蘭外長柏克上校的遊說南斯拉夫。因爲南斯拉夫雖然是小恊的國的一員，但與德國並沒有大的利害衝突，與波蘭更有親近的可能，所成問題的是德波現在芷在努力拉攏匈牙利，而匈牙利與南斯拉夫的矛盾父很深刻，所以柏克上校遊說的主要課題便是調和南斯拉夫與匈牙利的矛盾，使它們都加入德波集團，以與法蘇集團對立。其决便是近日德國經濟部長的往遊東南歐。據說他此行的仟務是在企圖修正德國與南斯拉夫，匈牙利，保加利亞及希臘等國所成立的抵賬協定，並在東南歐成立經濟集團，使各農業國與德國樹立密切的貿易關係；除此之外，並無別的政治意義。但是，經濟與政治是分不開的，德國與巴爾幹半島的經濟關係一密切，隨着半島上的某些國家亦必會在政治上與牠親近。事實上，正當沙赫特遊說南斯拉夫之際，就有德國着名軍火廠克魯伯廠將運大批軍火往巴爾幹的傳說，是則謂沙赫特此行毫無政治意義，豈非欺人之談？據目前形勢看來，德國的企圖是在經過波蘭以拉攏匈牙利和南斯拉夫；如果這個企圖成爲事實，那旣可以使意奧匈的同盟解體，而使奧大利不得不走向德國來；又可以分散小協的國集團，以削弱乃至排除在巴爾幹，在多瑙河流域的法國和意大利的力量。但是這種企圖是會遭到法意乃至捷克和羅馬尼亞之强力抗阻的，至於將來的結果究竟加何，那還要由歐洲列强的矛盾發展來决定。</p>
<p>至於决一僩事件，即由意大利所扶助的奧國復辟運動，那是比前一個問題還要來得嚴重。因爲原來奧匈帝國的統治者是哈布斯堡王家；大戰以後奧甸帝國解體，哈布斯堡王朝傾覆，它的土地被羅馬尼亞和南斯拉夫奪去了許多，而捷克斯拉夫更全是由奧匈帝國的舊領構成的；假使哈布斯堡王家復辟成功，奧匈必將提出收回失地問題，這便要威脅到小協的國的存在；所以，對於奧國的復辟，小恊的國是非拚命反對不可的。我們可以說小恊的國的組成便是爲的防止哈布斯堡王家的復辟。事實上，在小恊的各國相互的協的中，對於防止哈布斯堡王家的復辟問題，都有具體的條文規定。但奧國在它的國情之下，却只有兩條路可走：一是與德國合併，另一即是實行復辟，重建奧匈帝國；至於匈牙利，當然也希望恢復哈布斯堡王朝時代的繁榮，收復失地的。最近因爲德國的撕碎諾加羅公約，與匈都有違反聖札曼和特　農條的的舉動，這已經引起了小恊的國的不安；至於跟着來的近來奧國復辟運動的發展，那當然重要遭到它們極大的反對。</p>
<p>事實上，當奧匈總揆在羅馬活動，哈布斯堡王家復辟之說甚囂塵上的時候，小恊的國各元首就在羅馬尼亞京城舉行會議，决定今後仍信守去年八月五日所宜布的政策；那政業的內容是：「　反對哈布斯堡皇室復辟；　凡企圖修改多瑙河流域現行疆界者，小協商三國决以武力對付之」。問題之嚴重於此可見。</p>
<p>但是，在意大利左右下的奧匈，是正在向着復辟道路邁進的；奧國的保皇黨與奧當局密切的關係已從公開的形式上表現了出來，羅馬　奧國的復辟已擬好了具體的方案，風聲所播，哈布斯堡王朝大有馬上復興之勢。假使哈布斯堡王朝復辟事件發動，那不僅小協的國要用武力來反對，就是德法兩國，爲了它們在多瑙河流域，在巴爾幹的權利，也要作有效的抗議；結果必然是第二次　界大戰再從巴爾幹，從多瑙河流域爆發起來。慕索里尼也知道這問題的嚴重性，所以他最近正在設法調解德奧的矛盾，企圖拉攏德國，以實現哈布斯堡王家的復辟，使多瑙河流域，巴爾幹半島都控制在羅馬勢力之下。但希特勒對這位同道者的回答却是德國並不贊成奧大利復辟；至於對巴爾幹乃至整個歐洲問題的熊度，那他還要看現刻正在進行的小恊的國參謀會議之結果以及英意關係之發展情形如何纔能决定。這樣，問題的解决就更加困難了。</p>
<p>總括起來看，目前巴爾幹半島的第一個力量不消說是注國的與國小恊的國集團；這個集團是要維持現狀的。其次是意大利在希臘在亞爾巴尼亞的勢力；慕索里尼現刻正在努力促成奧國的復辟，使他在中歐和巴爾幹的勢力能聯成一片。再有的便是德國，目前它在巴爾幹雖還未有很大的基本勢力，但希特勒却正在努力團集南斯拉夫和保加利亞；更進而與波蘭和匈牙利連成一氣，形成一個集團的力量在巴爾幹進出。除此之外還有英國在希臘的勢力；這對於它在維護地中海的權利上有着很大的關係·所有這些勢力，所有這些勢力的發展方向，都是相互衝突的。在這些衝突中，目前値得特別注意的問題，便是上述的德波在巴爾幹的活動與小協的國的準備武力反對哈布斯堡七家復辟，這兩件事情的發展很可能變更巴爾幹半島的形勢，引起世界大戰的爆發。</p>
<p>最近巴爾幹協商四國情報會議在羅馬巴亞京城布加勒斯多舉行，羅外長蒂杜樓斯哥發表了這樣的演說：「吾人所希求者，僅爲保護本國之利益，而不願供任何人之驅策·對於歐洲列强如英法德意俄五國，無分彼此，均願與之友好相處；並不吝提出切實證據，藉以表示與人和平相處之誠意。雖然各國地位一律平等之原則乃係天經地義，决非吾人所願放棄；而任何决定凡與吾人有關而事前未得吾人之同意者，自亦不能加以接受。試一瞻望東起安哥拉（土耳其京城）西迄普拉格（捷克京城），糾糾桓桓執戈以衛和平者，不下七百萬衆！吾人對於和平誠所愛護，但决非爲盲目的和平主義者·方今之世，苟欲維護和平，法固莫善於準備赴戰，此爲吾人所深信者也。」這中間雖然充滿了「和平」的字眼，但結果却是「準備赴戰」；以準備赴戰」夾維持和平，是則「和平」的意義不啻就是戰爭。今日的巴爾幹乃至整個歐洲和世界，都是滿佈着掩飾在一和平」的詞句下的戰爭危機的；而羅外長的演說便正是這個意義的表明。</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>寺僧思凡</h3>
<p>— 釋慧明</p>
<p>在現在，想起我的十餘年來的特殊生活，連我自己都莫名其妙起來了，爲甚麽我要過着這樣的生活？這樣的生活是否合理？</p>
<p>旁的人之「吃齋拜佛」，是爲了受不過現世的「磨折，想登諸「天國」，求一個「來生世界：有些人是因爲酒色財富的物質生活都　過得厥倦了，想換換淸素的口味，享受一點「山林之樂；有些是想長生不老，永久保持「今生」的榮華富貴。但是我呢？我之學佛是純然出於探究哲理，要想在世上找尋一個究竟，發掘出人生的「眞諦」來。但是經過這樣多年辰的「修鍊」，總是沒得到好多確實的「證騐」，至於「成正果」，「證眞如」，那更不消說尙遙遙無期，因此我對於我現在和以前佔我生命一上半的學佛生活，不能不深深感到厭倦而懷疑了。這自然也許是由於我讀過一些佛書以外的「外道」之書，而有所「偏執」「迷誤」之故吧，但主要的原因還是由於我在「苦行」中得不出「究竟」來。</p>
<p>記得在中學讀書時，因爲家庭環境之惡劣，和學校敎育之不良，加以那時（民國十年左右）的學術思想之陳舊迂腐，只要稍爲肯運用思想的靑年，對於現實生活都不大滿意的，我便是這樣的靑年之一，我那時才十四歲。那時中學敎員中就有不少「坐禪」「入道」的國文敎員，他們除敎學生幾篇古文外，便呌我們讀「大學」的「格致誠正」，「在明明德」，以及「中庸」上的「致中和」，進一步敎我們　王陽明的「語錄」，學「致良知」，更進一步敎我們讀「了凡四訓」，「太上感應篇」，結果是替我們講佛書，讀「成唯識論述記」。在這樣的陶冶之中，我們不知不覺的漸漸感到世界是有究竟的，不過這需得我們去探求。過後又知道單是在書本上用工夫是不行的，終不得「解脫」，所以必然到了學佛之一途。這便是由佛學而到學佛的初步，在我整個生活上這也是一個大的階段。</p>
<p>經幾個敎員的介紹，我在附近的壁山廟正式「人道」了。當時的情形是這樣：壁山廟正在做「水陸道場」，超度一切遠近的「孤魂野鬼」，爲地方上求福，「經生」下七八十人，期間是七七四十九天。敎主是一位姓陳的，他在附近</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>幾個縣份都很有名望，上自縣知事精紳，下至農民力夫，都有許多去「拜門」，其「徒弟」不下三千人。這决的水陸道場是陳敎主親自主持的。經幾個「引進」介紹，把自己的姓名塡在一張黃榜祇上面，山引進呈到「老師」（即主敎）面前，經老師核奪，再批下來。第一次我知我的一個朋友被批掉了，原因是前生「宿孽深重」。經引進數决轉懇，又由我們跪在「師尊面前的石板上泣叩，過了兩　鐘，總算得了師尊的寬恕，情願代我們「轉奏」。</p>
<p>在一間四面都關閉得很做，不准任何人進內的屋子裏，石板上跪着我們將近二十個「入道」的弟子，周圍又坐着十幾個我們的師兄，上面是盤坐着我們的陳師尊。屋子裏面黑得像深夜，地面是堅硬而冰冷的石板。除了隔壁「經堂」內唸經的嗡嗡之聲和敲「木魚」的　　之聲外，整個廟宇都是肅靜的，只間或有山林中的風聲從山谷樹林間打到紙窗上面。師尊正式說話了，我們都停着呼吸在聽。首一段是講人生是如何的罪惡，悲苦，决一段是說一切的學問之無究竟，第三才說到佛舉之深奧。他又引經據典來證明解釋。但這都是從學理方面來說明爲甚麼要學佛。其次才說到解脫之方，即是怎樣去學佛。他說我們要「行居坐臥，不離這個」。即是說隨時隨　都應記着念着這一點。但他還未說出「這個」之先，又要我們一一宜誓，叫我們不要把他敎給我們的「秘訣轉吿未入道的「凡夫」，即或就是父母亦不能吿訴，不然是要遭「天神鑒察」的。我們發過誓後師尊才說出「這個」米。他說，「你們隨時隨地心裏都要記着，想着一個「水中之天」，「水中之月」。甚麼是水中之天呢？就是要想着我們的脚下有一幅浩大無邊的水，水底有一輪明月，彷彿親白看見一樣。只這一點，務要隨時閉着眼睛默念着，不久自有道理」。所謂「這個」便是這個。我們從老師那兒僅僅得到了這個。當時我們就處　時時想念這水中之天，水中之月起來。少不幾犬，居然就有「微候」了，隨時都似乎有一輪明月實現在眼前一樣。去問師兄們，他們也　：「你們要努力修鍊，你們天姿高，是很容易見功效的。」</p>
<p>「入門」以後進步又很快，自己滿以爲已找出了人生的正軌」，得到了「方仲法門」，便索性連書也不讀了，只跟着師尊學習修行。在水陸大會中我也是一名經生一。大槪才入鬥的弟子都要經過「經生」這一階段吧。自然，經生之中也有許多是　苦人家的子弟，靠唸經吃飯，並且得「香錢」供家的；也有爲超度自己家裏的「亡魂」來「誦經」的。但大部份都屬於我們這入門的弟子的初步工作，這是磨鍊你「俗人」的「凡心」的。早上七時起來，梳洗後便進到「經堂」。經堂分爲「黃壇」，「內壇」，「外壇」，「孤魂壇」。我先進去誦經的是孤魂壇，唸的是「解寃經」。唸一遍爲「一卷」，經短的每「一坐」（即是自進去到出來，經人換班」的一叚時間）唸到七八卷，經從的每一坐至少也得唸一卷。條解寃經那樣的經每一坐可唸兩卷到　卷，這看你誦熟與吾而定。一隻手敲着木魚，口裏裏要不住地唸出聲音米。在進壇時自然是面向着神位，出壇時也要面對神位，即是說要退着出來。開經時要合誦開經偈，經讀完時又合唱收經偈。每到早餐中餐晚餐時全體僧俗數百人又得合跪神前，由經生「頂禮」，奏樂，這叫「拜　」。每隔七大又耍於淸晨鷄嗚時起來「供天」。我最初七天是在孤魂壇誦解寃經，第二個七天便到內壇誦「週轉乾坤經」了，第三個七天便升到黃壇誦「金剛經」了。金剛經是最難誦的經，上面滿都是由印度文翻譯過來的譯音，如「多羅三貌三普提須普提」，「吉提吉提波羅生吉提普提沙波訶」等，道是全用不着思想理解，只是用聲音的，你就讀數十卷也記不得，這是磨鍊凡心的最好的東西。白天是誦經，夜間便「不離道個」地默念着。我的學佛生活便這樣開始了。</p>
<p>水陸道場閉幕後，我便拋別家庭父母，跟着師尊到他的「道院」去「修行」。除了應遵守老師的一切「戒律」之外，便是做雜務工作，同才做學徒時必須打掃地板，拿烟倒茶一樣。廟裏的工作是打掃地板和「燒香」。數百尊「諸仙諸佛」，每到早晚都得去燒香打躬，也够麻煩了。在靜坐室中有一排一排的蒲團，屋子也是陰沈暗淡的，每個蒲團上面坐一個人，大家鴉雀無聲，每天規定有六個鐘頭的「坐禪」，但勤奮的弟子除了吃飯而外是可以一天坐到黑的。老師自然也要「打坐」，不過他是在他自己的「禁室」裹，弟子未經傳訓，是不准入內的。大部分的弟子都只是「打坐」，不大讀書，有些倒是程度很淺，讀不懂書，有些雖能讀書，但他們總是遵守師尊的話，「多修少想」，「知見記問之學，不如淸心寡慾」，就讀書也不外佛門的戒律，頂多也不過「大乘起信論」而已，對於高深的經典，如「般若經」，「華嚴經」，「唯識論」諸書，大概是很少人去過問的。只有我與他們不同，一方面固然穩坐，但一方面也喜歡讀諸宗的經論，並知道我們所宗的是那　宗，此外還有那些宗，又以此常同師兄師師尊討論，研究誰是誰非，但結果他們也未有確實的解答。</p>
<p>「不離這個」地學習已近三年了，但是除了那一輪明月實現眼前的「火候」（境况）而外，別的就都看不見甚麼，有些是不大追究的，我使不然，要問老師更進一步的境界。他說，「萬丈高樓從地起」，還是努力不離這個」好了。他又說他學了四十餘年，現在才勉强可以「上升」，同諸仙佛會面。他叫我們冉修四十年再說。我從各家佛書中也找不出甚麼「方便法門」米，但是我又相信「此中自有道理一。有時在風晨月夕，在叫無人聲之時，獨坐在自己的「禪床」上，也不免撩起些凡雜之念，也想到「聲色貨利」之類的人間生活，有時也懷疑到極樂世界的渺茫遼遠。不過在這樣的環境中是跳不出去另尋他路的。</p>
<p>過了幾年「廟居」生活，又過了幾年「居士生活，我的「道行」還無起色，又因爲時勢轉變，我從朋友處也得讀到少許新的雜誌書籍，這史使我對於學佛一道起了懷疑。我現在的生活和行爲也大不如十年前那樣忠誠和拘執，對佛那樣信賴了。我想我遲早總是要「還俗」，要回到「凡夫外道」的。</p>

<h3>介紹「從小學到初中」</h3>
<p>— 沅君</p>
<p>——錢弗公葛石熊沈家夢著，蓬萊路近泮坊中國兒童文藝社出版——</p>
<p>我國敎育的不普及是人所共知的事實。在他國，一個中學生，方在求學的開始，似乎尙値不得人家十分的重視，但在我國，文盲佔到百分之八十以上，國民能受義務敎育的尙且那樣少，而一個孩子能有機會從小學畢業後更進入初中，這實在無異於「天之驕子」了。據以前中華職業敎育社調査，全國公社立中學校學生共一一八·五九八人，而全國總人口的計四萬五千萬人，他的比例爲「四〇〇〇與一之比」，中國人中，四千人中僅有一個中學生，這四千人之選的中學生，是如何値得我們寳貴愛惜呢。所以從我國特殊的情况下講，我們對於中學生的現在與將來，都懷着無窮的希望的。</p>
<p>從一般情形講，中學敎育是敎育的中堅，基礎雖然重要，中堅亦未嘗可稍忽略。一　剛從小學畢業的學生，在他的生理上心理上正當有顯著發育的時期，也正是童年與少年交替的時期，在敎育的階段上，是到臨了一個很危險的時期了，若不加以適當的合理的完善的指導，而使他誤入了歧途，不僅身體足以因此摧毀，就是一生的幸福，或許也因此犧牲了。一個從小學畢業的學生，因爲有較好的家庭，因爲有較賢明的家長，能够得到升學的機會，是如何艱難的事，但功虧一簣，這少數的鳳毛麟角，仍然未能盡其所用，將是何等可惜的事，所以從這一方面看來，從小學到初中的學生，需要合理的指導，允覺不容或緩了。</p>
<p>在孩子自己，小學畢業了，父母兄長給他升學的機會了，他的心理上就起子無窮的惶惑了，入學試騐雖然是一件不熟習的事，但不熟習的事還多着呢！因爲人學以後，換了新環境，人地很生疏，工作茫無頭緒，正如一個女子剛做新嫁娘的時候，一個女子住慣了原來的家庭，一旦要她生長到另一個家庭裏去，當然會發生無窮的惶惑。他正希望有人給他好好的指導，吿訴他如何在新環境中生活，好像將出閣的小姐希望她媽媽能吿訴她結婚後如何生活一樣。</p>
<p>所以，無論從一般的情形講，從我國的特殊情形講，或從孩子的本身講，從小學到初中的學生，都迫切的需要合理的指導。</p>
<p>從小學到初中是人生階段中的一座大橋樑，是敎育階段中一個銜接的寳筏，至於如何渡過這橋樑，如何利用這寳筏，在以前，雖有敎師們盡了相當指導的責任，但『臨別贈言』，總是意雖長而言不易盡，不免掛一漏萬。能彌補這缺憾的，祇有最近中國見童文藝社發行，錢弗公葛石熊沈家夢三先生編著的「從小學到初中」一書。牠系統的，科學的，負了指導「從小學到初中」的學生的重任。</p>
<p>錢葛沈三先生都曾祖任過多年中小學的敎務，憑了他們豐富的敎育經騐，參合着最新的敎育原理與實際的敎育環境，寫成這一册近五萬字的著作，實屬他們心血的結晶，卷首並有潘公展先生的序文，他說：「從小學到初中是求學的重要階段，一般的生活，和各科的學習，都該有具體的指導，這一本書，便是適應十這需要的產物，是小學畢業生和初中肄業生的指導書，也便是敎師和父母們的參考書。」</p>
<p>該書前後共分七章，第一章題爲「從小學到初中」這是指導小學畢業生如何去過中學生活的專章，誠懇地誘導他」，們培養自治自律的精神。確實的，大多初中學生，都得負笈他鄕，父母縱然心愛他們的子女，但已無從直接施其敎養，所可直接負責的，祇有仰賴於學校裏的敎帥，可是中學的敎帥，正因爲初中學生已不是孩子了，在生活的指導上，學業的督促上，和小學又大有寬嚴疏密的不同，這並不是中學敎帥不能如小學敎師那般的負責，而是因爲初中的學生，本來應有自自律的精神。有許多學生，在小學時代，身體學業品行都好，可是一到初中，却把身體弄弱了，把學業弄糟了，把品性弄壞了，小學和中學不還是一樣過着學校生活嗎？但爲什麽會發生這樣不同的結果呢？這便是因爲缺少自治自律的精神的緣故。本章立論精警，伸述透澈，文字允足以感動孩子的心。第二章題爲「一個健全的初中學生」，根據我國敎育宗旨，析述一個健全的初中學生應具的條件，一耍鍜鍊健全身體，二要具備公民道德，三要了解民族文化，四要充實生活知能，五要培植科學基礎，六要養成勞動習慣，七要富有藝術興趣，面面俱到，辭意新穎，能不落一般舊調。第三章題爲「吿訴你幾個求學的重要原則」，分爲七小節（　認淸求學的目標，　堅定求學的决心，　明白求學的範圍，　三種必要的求學心理，　幾個增進求學興趣的方法，　四種優良的求學習慣，　幾種必要的求學精神），站在敎育心理學的立塲，用淺顯的文字，叙述出來，作者是用了很大的苦心的。第四章題爲「指示你一些讀書的方法」，從求學和讀書的關係說起，進而說到讀書的環境，讀書的工具，以及記憶對於讀書的關係，莫不脚踏實地，槪括的吿訴你許多讀書的實用方法。第五章題爲「在初中裏學些什麼」，將初中學科如公民，體育，衛生，國文，英語，算術，植物學，動物學，化學，物理學，歷史，地理，勞作，音樂，圖畫的學習目標透澈的分析了、一下，這對於學生的學習實有很大的帮助的。因爲學習的動機，要在需要之源中，學習的興趣才會增加，學習的效率才會顯著，吾則盲人瞎馬，機械的學習，無所爲的學習，一定會失敗的。第六章題爲「幾種重要學科的學習」，這一章完全是實際方法的指導，對於國文，作文，英語，算學，自然科學，社會科學都有詳盡的指示，第七章爲「怎樣吸收新知識」，關於閱報，讀雜誌以及如何利用圖書館的方法，說得很淸楚，要這樣多方面的吸取新知識，才不致僅僅做畫獃子，或敎科書的奴隸。</p>
<h3>介紹「世界語新論」</h3>
<p>— 聶風</p>
<p>——徐沫著，新知書店出版，實價二角五分——</p>
<p>在文化，技術，科學……一切都迅速地國際化的今日，「國際的言語」已　不再僅僅是詩人底美麗的幻想，而是現實生活底迫切的要求了。世界語</p>
<p>（Espernto）便是這類適應了大衆底需求而產生</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>的許多種國際的言語中最成功的一種。</p>
<p>世界語在中國差不多已有三十多年的歷史，在這一大段時期裏，特別是最近三四年裏，它在一般靑年中間所起的影響，已經達到了很廣汎深刻的程度。但是另一方面，中國世界語運動同時也有着一個不可掩飾的缺點，卽是理論常常落在實踐的後面。本來，就數量上說，國內出版的介紹和研究世界語的著作，不算不多，可是對於這問題有着深刻的觀察和精當的分析的却並不多見。大多數不是偏愛，就是偏惡，始終沒有觸到問題的核心。因此，在過去，一般人對於世界語往往得不到正確的認識。</p>
<p>這缺點直到這一本「世界語新論」出版後才澈底消滅了。</p>
<p>這書底作者本身就是世界語運動的實踐者，從而對於這問題也就有着比較更深入的全面的理解，這是本書底許多優點之最根本的原因。詳細說來，它的所以能超越過去許多同類的著作，主要是因了下面三點。</p>
<p>第一是正確的方法論。本書底基礎理論是從唯物論的耶弗言語學出發的。它在處理世界語底歷史，文法構造，技術和運動諸問題時，處處不忘記把它們和現實社會底根本因素——經濟，政治，文化底發展聯繫起來，而以動的觀點把握這些問題；它不但分析了世界語底過去和現在，並且還邏輯地預測了它底未來。祇有在本書裏，我們才找到了對於世界語與民族語的關聯這一問題之最合理的解答。</p>
<p>關於言語的構造，本書從之形態學和語源學上指出了世界語底「純粹的黏着型言語的特質」，因而說明了那向來被人誤解的世界語底簡易性之眞正的根源。這更是作者底獨特的創見。</p>
<p>第二是材料的豐富。本書在容量上雖則不算多，却謹約然而充分地提到了世界語底一切方面，譬如：世界語底產生之歷史的契機，在實踐裏的世界語的活躍，世界語在言語進化過程中的地位和作用，世界語運動底鬥爭，分化，和現實社會諸勢力之消長所投於世界語運動之面影等等。後面二章「基礎文法」和「對照讀物」詳細地剖析了世界語底構成，對於有興趣學習世界語的人允其有極大的帮助。</p>
<p>第三是文筆的通俗。通俗化是一切現代知識達到廣大民衆的必需的橋樑，本書在這方面是模範的。讀着這本書的時候，彷彿在聽一位老友底娓娓長談，而不覺是在讀書，一般理論書常有的多餘的術語和生硬的句子，在這本書裏是找不到的。無論那個多少學過一點中國文的人，都可以毫不吃力地把它一口氣讀下去。</p>
<p>爲了這新時代的言語之更茂盛的茁長，我高興地介紹這一本入門書於每一個渴求著現代知識和現代言語的青年朋友們！</p>

<p>這幾天已屆夏季，我們每天都可以在馬路上看見許多女同胞中的時代姑娘們，撑着一柄柄的小紙傘，用以抵抗驕陽或者暴雨。這些傘的質料，外觀透朋，鮮艷奪目。據記者調査所得，這倒是完全國人自製的一種手工出品，它的主要原料是紙，油，柿漆，漿糊，髮繩，麻錢，竹，木等八種，可以分述如下：</p>
<p>先說紙：每一紙傘的堅固耐用，全靠紙的優良。傘舖採用的紙張，名目繁多，但上等的多半是白桑皮紙，因爲它質地細靱，光滑自淨，製成紙傘，色澤鮮潔透明，久經烈日，堅牢沙裂。中等的則多採用决等薄桑皮紙，或半料紙及黃綠紙等。此種紙張，質稍粗劣，靱度亦遜，色彩略帶灰黃，製成後頗不耐用。下等者則採用元柏連等，性質最粗劣不靱，一經晒炙，硬脆易碎。至於出口紙傘，則多用景寗紙。</p>
<p>第二是油：紙傘所用之油，僅爲桐油，靑油兩種，出產於四川，雲南者爲最佳。桐油質厚，靑油質薄，單獨施用，均不相宜，故傘舖中常取兩種油類，等量混合，然後塗抹紙傘。近來因購紙傘者多厭惡桐油臭味，故傘舖中乃减少桐油成分，通常混合數，桐油佔二三成，靑油佔七八成。</p>
<p>原料中的柿漆，係由一種柿類之菓實中取出，色澤淸灰濃厚，而性至黏。塗於紙上，立變　色，旣乾後浸之水中，又可歷久不透水。</p>
<p>至於紙傘上的漿糊，則用時不宜過厚或過薄。過厚漿糊製成傘面，硬而不柔：過薄則日久易脫落。故調漿糊時麥粉與水的配合，最好是麥粉一合加水九合，煮到半熟，再用小棒打攪，待冷塗用。髪繩：是拿人髮洗去油質，待乾後由女工製成髮繩，以精細勻整者爲佳。其質堅牢不斷，置乾濕地上，均可歷久不腐。麻綫：以白蔴製成者爲佳，傘舖所用大多向蔴綫店購現成者，並非自製。紙傘之傘骨傘柱均由竹片製成，製骨之竹以節長肉厚條直者爲最宜。傘頭傘柄若用木質，則以堅靱之棗栗木爲宜。　　紙傘之製造，其手藝工拙，出品優劣，雖各不同，但製造方法則大概相似。卽　製傘骨：先取全毛竹，截成片段，段之長，分、一尺四寸，一尺五寸，一尺七寸，一尺九寸，二尺二寸，二尺四寸至六寸等，再將片段剖成細片，闊的一分五，厚不足一分。此細片中段，在削斫時留一隆起處，長二分五或三分：用脚踏有齒轉盤，向隆起處正面挖取凹路，約深一分許；再於隆起處側面鑽一細孔，穿髮備綑。細片全長之一端，削成圓珠形，一端削扁，側面鑽一小孔，亦　穿髮繩，此爲製長傘骨之方法。若截毛竹，片段長七寸，七寸五，八寸五，九寸五，一尺一，一尺二寸六等，閥的二分，厚的一分，兩端削扁，側面各鑽一小孔，此爲短傘骨。長短傘骨聯組時，如長骨一尺四寸者，短骨以七寸配合之，其餘依此類推。以長短骨各一相配合者，名曰一組紙傘，每把組數各有不同，但普通紙傘，至少以三十六組，至多以五十四組爲標準。　製傘頭：傘頭原料通常用竹木，精細者用牛角或銅質，每把傘上有內外二傘頭，形圓而中空，丙傘頭外方用脚踏有齒盤鋸成凹路，作齒輪狀，齒輪凸起之側面各鑽一小孔，一用以聯綴長骨，一用以聯綴短骨。　穿髮繩：長短傘骨及傘頭之聯綴法，取髪繩條先穿長骨有孔之一端，再取髮繩穿傘頭凸齒孔中，如法一一穿盡，然後拔髮繩，將長傘骨之一端均嵌入傘頭凹路，打結割下剩餘髮繩：次另取髮經一條，將短傘骨如法穿入，另一傘頭用長短傘骨對合，將短骨一端嵌入長骨中段隆起處，凹路用髮繩由隆起側面小孔中順序穿過，使長短傘骨不致股離。此後將傘骨闔閉，則長短骨間角度小，而幾相平行，放開則長短骨成一百二十度之鈍角，長骨外端復綴以麻錢或棉綫，環繞一周或數周，使長骨與長骨之間，距離相同，角度相等，不致有所移動。</p>
<p>糊紙是製紙傘的重耍工作，先將桑皮紙裁成一長骨與短骨間等量二角形之銳角，乃張開已穿髮細之傘骨，塗柿漆或漿糊於長傘骨上，同時將等量三角紙黏貼傘骨上，此爲第一决工作。再用杮漆或漿糊滿塗紙上，復以三角形紙黏貼之後，以毛刷刷之，使紙與紙問十分黏固，此爲第二决工作。至第二决工作時，則待柿漆或漿糊晒幹，乃裁一圓形紙，直徑長約一尺二，共圓心挖一小洞套上傘頂，傘頂四周塗杮漆或漿糊，乃用毛刷細細刷拭·如法加紙二次，使乾，卽是白胚。紙傘塗柿漆者發稷色，塗漿糊者發白色，以質地牢固而論，則漿糊不及柿漆。但現時紙傘上繪飾花鳥山水人物等，不用漿糊，因其色不易鮮明美觀也。進步者改用白芨汁膠粘，故外觀透明，又可代漿糊之用。</p>
<p>至於繪畫，分爲二種，一爲先畫而後塗油，一爲先塗油而後畫。先畫後塗油者又分兩種：一爲印花；一爲手工畫花。先塗油後畫者都用手工繪畫，尙未有印花之改進。通常所用顏料，紅用銀硃，綠用石綠，藍用洋藍，黃用黃粉。若欲塗成雜色，則用銀硃，洋藍，黃粉先行配合，再與桐靑混合油混合。</p>
<p>最後裝傘柱傘柄：傘柱大都圓形，傘柄則有方有圓，或製成各種式樣，宜漆者漆之，宜塗油者塗油。傘柱的長度，大槪較傘骨長五寸至一尺左右，柄則長二寸至五寸左右。其裝置法，將傘柱穿過下傘頭孔中，用細釘釘牢使之不脫，並於傘柱中段裝置一有彈力之活塞。</p>
<p>以前本埠製紙傘作塲達三四百家。民國初年，陽傘進口日增月盛，國人亦多棄紙傘業而設廠自製陽傘。五九之後，抵制仇貨，紙傘業與國產陽傘業都稍有起色，其後劣貨暢銷，又受打擊。五卅以後，直至國府定鼎南京，國貨提倡聲甚囂塵上，而仕女因紙傘頗有改良，亦樂於採用，故頗現活躍。惟因外埠如福州，杭州等地商販多集中上海，使本市自製者銷路更狹，據最近調査，紙傘作塲不滿百家，且大多改用牛皮紙或兼營油布雨傘矣。</p>
<p>國產紙傘頗爲歐美人士所樂購，每年出口，暢旺時曾達三百萬柄以上（包括各地紙傘出品集中滬埠者），歷年因外商仿製，銷額遞减，最近傳每年祗有四五十萬柄出口云。</p>
<p>海外通訉網</p>
<h3>巴力斯坦的猶太人</h3>
<p>— 伯常</p>
<p>耶路撒冷通訉</p>
<p>巴力斯坦原來是猶太故墟，戰前是士耳其的領地，戰後便成爲了英國人的代管地帶。因爲地理的關係，這地方對於英帝國主義，在保護蘇伊士運河的安全上，在控制亞非兩洲的陸路交通七，都非常重要。但這地方有兩個民族，卽阿刺伯人和猶太人；他們本來都是受英帝國主義統治壓迫的，站在他們自身解放的立</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>上，理應一致團集起來反抗英人；可是因爲他們兩者間有衝突，以致常常發生糾紛；而英帝國主義也就利用着他們的矛盾來維持了它在這地方的統治。最近這地方的阿刺伯人和猶太人的衝突日益嚴重，耶路撒冷聖地的秩序已成爲了難於維持的混亂狀態；但關於他們衝突的一般情形，每天的新聞紙都有報吿，無須我們詳說；這裏所要報吿的，只是此間猶太人的一般情形，希望因此能對於巴力斯坦的民族問題的了解有些帮助。</p>
<p>本來巴力斯坦的猶太人只佔全人口八分之一，但近來因爲他們努力招致海外同胞回國以圖復興，同時英國也想利用各地猶太商人的資本來開發和繁榮這古老的國士巴力斯坦，所以目前這裏猶太人的數量和勢力比過去都增大了許多；當然，在另一方面，阿刺伯人的生活是感到了很大威脅的。</p>
<p>猶太人現在雖沒有他我們的祖國，但一般說來，猶太商人很多是擁有大量資本而且善於經營事業的；巴力斯坦這古老的國士在他們的不斷投資和努力經營之下，的確也表現出了日益繁榮的現象。首先一引起我們注意的是他們開一發荒地的成績：過去差不多可說是沙漠地方，而今却成爲了綠葉成蔭的果樹園；就中的蜜橘更是名聞世界。本來蜜橘的舊有生產地，主要的是西班牙，意大利，巴西以及北美等國，但因爲猶太人在這里栽培果樹事業的發展，在最近倫敦，巴黎等地的世界消費市塲上竟佔有了重要的地位，對於上述那些舊有蜜橘生產地也表現出了很大的競爭力量。據報吿，目前這里新生的小密橘樹已有數百萬棵之多，這樣，對於別的蜜橘的競爭國不消說將會有更大威脅的。</p>
<p>同時，在猶太人開發下的這里的一般農業也很進步。他們用最新的方法引用河水灌溉土地，並巧妙地將土中的鹽分排去，以增加農業的地域和收穫。在這里的農村中，差不多到處都有現代化的農產加工的工塲；電綫更像蜘蛛網一般，四通八達，非常便利，一般交通當然也是在日益發展的；與過去的巴力斯坦比較起來，眞可說是另一個世界。</p>
<p>這樣，常然的結果便是近年來這古老國士的一般工商業的發展，對外貿易的統計數字之上昇，市面的繁榮。此種情形在向這里的移民人數之增加一事中卽可明白見到。據本地的統計，一九三三年到這里的移民總數是三〇·三二七人，就中有二五〇人擁有一千鎊以上的資本；一九三四年的這個總數是四二·三五九人，擁有一千鎊以上的資本者有五·一二四人；去年上半期的這個總數也超過了一九三三年的，達到了三○·四七四人。這樣的數字的表現，在目前的不景氣潮流中，不消說是有更重大意義的。</p>
<p>在巴力斯坦新增的人口中，主要的當然是歸國的猶太人。所以，上述那樣的到這里的移民增加，除表示這地方的繁榮外，更表示出了猶太人的復國運動之發展和他們在這地方的勢力之增加。事實上，近年來在耶路撒冷和別的都市中就新增了許多百貨商店和工商業組合，而這些又多半是以猶太人爲主體的。</p>
<p>但是，在這古老的國一土的繁榮中，存在着兩個很大的矛盾：一個卽是上述的猶太人與阿刺伯人的利害衡突，另一個則是英國與猶太人的衝突。很顯然的，世界各地猶太人的返回巴力斯坦，其重要目的原在重建自己的祖國，企圖使這猶太故墟離英獨立而成爲猶太人自己的國家；但英帝國主義的企圖却是在利用猶太人的資本來繁榮它的這個殖民地，至於猶太人的復國運動，它當然要在實際上加以阻止的。目前英帝國主義正在努力挑撥猶太人和阿刺伯人的衝突，以阻止他們聯合一致的解放運動；而且，經過這次的這兩個民族的鬥爭後，他們間的情戚不消說是更惡化了，這當然也可說是英帝國主義政策很大的收獲。但是，同時由於事實的敎訓，這裏覺悟的阿刺伯入和猶太人已逐漸知道了他們的主要敵人是英帝國主義，他們要聯合起來與這主要的敵人作殊死的鬥爭以謀解放。事實上最近這里的一部分阿刺伯人與猶太人的衝突，已在開始轉向對英國的鬥爭了；同時，有些猶太人在事實上已有了反英的許多表示；他們中的最覺悟的份子都在希望兩個弱小民族聯歡，一致反抗共同的敵人英帝國主義，以謀大家的眞正解放。</p>

<h3>職時務</h3>
<p>— 璣</p>
<p>『識時務者爲俊傑』這句話，你可以在一般官塲宦海中，在冬烘先生品茗坐談中，常常聽得到的。原來這句話的簡單的意思，卽是說只要一個人能够把客觀的時事看得淸楚明白，那麽他就是一個豪傑了。眞的，一個人要能把顯現在他眼前的大大小小的時下事務，都弄明白了它的底蘊，眞象和其變化趨勢，並且隨着它的現狀和趨勢去採取適宜的適應方略，能够不遠逆它的動向，順着它實踐下去，本是十分困難的。眞能做到了這點，也的確不愧爲一個英雄豪傑，可以幹出些事業來。</p>
<p>是，嚴格地說來，還不要說怎樣去識時務乃不是一般人所易理解的罷，就是對於『識時務者爲俊傑』這句話本身的意義，也就有正確與錯誤和深淺不同的見解的。我們知道，在一般鄙俗的人之理解『識時務者爲俊傑』這句話，往往是站在個人的私利的觀點上，甚至是以很狹隘和近視的眼光去看它的。在他們之所謂識時務的人，並不是脫一個人應當如何看淸楚現時事態之各種社會的意義和其錯綜複雜的社會關係，看淸楚每一事態如何根據這些社會的錯綜複雜的關係而發生出來，以及它怎樣關聯於社會的全機構之各方面等等；也不是敎人去看淸楚社會之全般的局勢和共發展的必然法則，更不是敎人怎樣立脚於社會的和大衆的利益上去認識一定事態之價値，爲着社會的利益而採用適當的活動方法去適應它的需要等等；特別是不能從社會的發展和進化的觀點，敎人去認淸社會的現時事態中所隱示和包含的二歷史的進程中之較遠大的必然趨向，認淸時代和潮流，站在進步的立塲上去適應社會之前進的發展，推動社會前進。他們僅僅是在敎人追逐目前的個人的實利，變成一切現實事態之私利的追求者，跟着事變的尾巴跑的尾巴主義者。因爲他們只在追逐已經現實出來的事態，所以他就很近視地以爲只有這表現於我們眼前的東西，才是値得重視和應當把握的，才是眞實而有利的。這就如黑格爾所說的那樣，視『一切現實的都是合理的』。又因爲他們只立脚於個人的私利的立塲上去認識時務，所以他們對於現實事態之評價和把握，也只看它和自己的利益是吾相合。如果於自己有利，那麽這件事就是有意義的和値得做的，反之便是無意義的，不當做的。他們以爲只有這樣看了風色去做事，就算是識時務，吾則卽算是不識時務，甚至是迂腐。並且在一般的所謂識時務，還有看勢力，看流俗的社會趨向如何而追逐這一趨向的意義在。因爲他們並不在於要求認淸事情之當爲不當爲，只在於看一般的流俗的世人是稱贊或反對這件事，如果大家都在那樣做，於是我也應當這樣去做，這就算是識時務的俊傑了。像這樣的所謂識時務，實際上只能算是趨炎附勢，隨波逐流。像這樣的人是重個人的私利而忘掉了改造社會的責任，是沒有特立獨行的能力的人，那裏算得是識時務的人，算得俊傑呢？但是像這樣去理解識時務的意義和如此去實踐的人，在社會上却多得很。他們經常地只注視着社會勢力的消長，如果某種勢力在社會的比重上抬高了，他們就往那邊一倒，隨聲附和起來。反之，如果客觀形勢改變了，有了另一種勢力起而代之，他們便又搖身一變往這邊倒，也隨聲附和起來。他們永遠只企圖站在得勢的一</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>方面，永遠只想取巧地顧到自己的實利不落空虛和受損害，隨時都成爲飛黃騰達者，成爲有權有勢力的人。假如有人說　沒有堅定的立塲和操守，那麽他就設他是通權達便，是識時務的俊傑。他們不但自認爲是識時務的俊傑，而且也常常以『識時務者爲俊傑』的話去勸人投機取巧，把純潔自持，不肯趨炎附勢的人呌做迂腐不識時務。所以在過去的歷史上，就常有那不願與世混濁而求顯達的人，被人指責爲是不達權便，不識時務的人。現在的社會當然更是如此。</p>
<p>那末怎樣才能算是識時務的俊傑呢？這明明是說凡是一個有遠識的高明的人，他只耍能看淸社會的事象之眞諦，把一切事態和社會的全局都能瞭若指掌，知道它的演進變化的必然法則，因此卽能看淸社會歷史進化之過去未來的道路，看淸時代和時代的潮流而預知其未來的發展，這才是能識時務的人。又他的行動是基於他的認識以爲根據的，他把握定了社會進化之一定趨向，能不爲一時的現象所蒙蔽和誘惑，因此能堅定其自己的立塲，能保持自己的操守。他也不顧一時的失敗和成功，不計一時的利害，勞力與榮辱，而始終爲人羣的福利，爲社會的利益去積極地改造社會，推進社會，却把自己個人的利害置之度外，這才能算是俊傑，才能算是識時務的俊傑。識時務是和實踐不能分離的，不但要能正確地認識客觀，才能算是識時務，並且要能正確地去實踐，才能算是俊傑，也才能够眞正識時務。因此不識時務的固然不算是俊傑，單是能識時務　不能實踐的，一樣算不得是俊傑。俊傑是從認識和實踐中才產生出來的，俊傑　識時務和依照其所識的時務而正確地去實踐兩者，是不可分離的。</p>
<p>至於說一個人要怎樣才能識時務，這也不是很簡單的事體，從上面所說的怎樣才能呌做瞰時務的道理看來，那他一定要有很銳敏的眼光，而這眼光就得根據他的學識。因他如果沒有分析客觀事變，認識社會演進之必然法則的眼光，他便不能認識當前的現實，不能識時務。可是要能認識客觀，他就得要有各種科學哲學的知識，特別是要有社會科學的知識，更特別是要有充分的政治經濟知識。不但如此，他要能算一個正確的識時務的人，仙必須是能看淸時代潮流與社會進化的趨向，如此則他不但要有知識，而且要具有在那一時代中算是最新的知識，具有站在前進的時代前面的新的知識，才有可能。因爲他沒有最新的武器和工具，是不能認識新的事變的。你若呌那些具有舊的知識，講子程子曰的飽學先生來識當今的時務，他必然是茫無所知的。所以要想當識時務的俊傑，在我們的社會裹他必須要先學得最進步而又最新的哲學，社會科學等等基本知識。其决是識時務也要靠我們有純潔的和光明磊落的胸襟，有堅定的立塲和操守的。因爲必須如此我們才不至斤斤於個人的私利的計較，使它來蒙蔽我們自己的客觀的純潔的知能，吾則也是不會識時務的。當然，這種人的本質亦不是天生的，要從認識和實踐中培養得來，但無論如何這種本質總是不可缺少的。最後是實踐的必要，因爲要能實踐才能更淸楚地認識客觀，要能實踐才算是俊傑，這我們已經說過了。</p>

<h3>後樓日記（二）</h3>
<p>— 叔羽</p>
<p>九月十四日</p>
<p>爲了搬家的事情，足足忙碌了一天，直到這時屋子裏的人都睡靜了，纔有工夫寫日記。這也可以說是一種窮忙。一個本來已取得了蹴居前樓的資格的人，忽地遭受了失業的痛苦，生活愈逼愈緊，以致不能不降格而就那女房東家的後樓。設若在這短時期內再找不到相當的職業，那我爲避免生活更猛烈的進襲起見，是只好退守到冬冷夏暖的亭子間去喝西北風，或是去曬熱烘烘的太陽，而最後的防綫不消說就是那個霧彌漫，熱氣蒸騰的灶間了。</p>
<p>一年來總得還居幾决的我，單是爲了搬塲這一伴事，已經是奔波得够苦了！說來此身眞好比是浮萍飛絮，歲歲度着流浪飄泊的生涯，騰雲駕霧的，這連自己都捉握不着的兩脚，不知要到何年何月何日纔能安穩地站住了。說一句威傷的話，我是猶不如飛鳥和狐狸，飛鳥和狐狸尙有牠們自己固定的巢穴，而我呢，却是落花無家！</p>
<p>一個單身漢所有的一切行李什物，居然也裝滿了一輛小車。當我押着車夫在街上走着時，我於無意之中發現出許許多多的人都已換上了綢衫或羅衫，甚至穿嗶嘰單衫的也有，而我身上却還是罩着一件夏布長衫；想不到季節竟變得這麽快，可見不記得日子也有吃虧的地方。眞的，一個聰明人是應該多多的和時間空間發生關係：常常的往大街小巷去慢步閒逛；如果能把日曆帶在身邊，那更好！（未完）</p>

<h3>Li Bai Not Awakened; Hunan Situation Increasingly Tense; Guangdong and Guangxi Military Preparations More Active; Miao Peinan Requests Sick Leave from Guangdong; He Jian Cables to Nanjing That Hunan's Security is Normal</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) After the Guangdong-Guangxi armies returned, the situation eased slightly, but military preparations have not stopped. Currently, the situation is tense again. More than 5,000 retired guards from various counties in Guangdong have come to the province for reinforcement, and 10,000 more are expected to arrive soon. A certain group continues to form the Sixth Independent Regiment, appointing Su Yuquan as the regimental commander. Zhang Da returned to Shaozhou on the 20th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangxi province allocated 100,000 yuan to Weng Zhaoyuan, recruiting more than 5,000 people. It is scheduled to establish the First Independent Division on the first day of next month, under the command of three regiments, appointing Xie Jingxin, Tang Yisheng, and a Mr. Chen as regimental commanders, with Qiu Guozhen as the chief of staff. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xiao Focheng stated on the 20th that the Southwest has decided to send central committee members to Nanjing to participate in the Second Plenary Session and discuss major plans with the central government. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hunan Chairman He Jian has sent several telegrams to Nanjing in recent days, reporting on the situation at the front lines, stating that the security in Hunan province is normal. He did not mention anything about the misunderstanding that occurred. At the same time, various relevant parties have also stated that this news is not very reliable. Furthermore, news indicates that the Guangdong army has indeed withdrawn from Chenzhou, concentrating in Yizhang and Shiping, while the Guangxi army is hesitating between advancing and retreating in the Yongzhou area, with unpredictable actions. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Hunan telegram states that the security in Hunan is normal. Five foreign warships are anchored in the Xiang River: two British, two Japanese, and one American. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Rumor has it that the Guangxi army has advanced into Qiyang again, with reinforcements gathering in Yongzhou, and defensive fortifications are being built on the Guangxi border. Many believe that Li Bai has not awakened, and the future is difficult to be optimistic about. The rift between Guangdong and Guangxi is becoming increasingly apparent. It is generally speculated that Chen [Jitang] will break with Guangxi and, under the command of the central government, clean up the situation in the two Guang provinces. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign newspapers reported that the Guangxi army in southern Hunan is advancing rapidly, leading to a misunderstanding with the local garrison. Inquiries to various parties have failed to confirm this. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A certain group has added an Independent Brigade, appointing Kong Kequan as the brigade commander. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Air Force is building an airfield and hangar at Baisha, under Huangqishan in Dongguan. The Air Force Headquarters and Air School are scheduled to move there next month. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Miao Peinan requested sick leave from Chen Jitang again on the 19th. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Guangdong has approved the import of the "Hong Kong Masses Newspaper." This newspaper is run by Chiang [Kai-shek] and Cai [Yuanpei]. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The main force of the Guangxi army entering Hunan, numbering 70,000, has been concentrating in Yongzhou in recent days and is being transported to Qiyang. It is heard that the strategy has been changed, and they are advancing towards Baoqing. (20th Shenshi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau is preventing the "Hong Kong Newspaper" from using anti-Japanese activities as a pretext for secret activities. Starting from the 18th, personnel have been dispatched to the Dashatou Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station to inspect the manuscripts supplied to "Hong Kong Newspapers." If necessary, reporters from various newspapers will be arrested. (20th Shenshi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Zhang Yan stated on the 20th that he has traveled extensively to various European and American countries and deeply understands that only unity can save the nation. He is now determined to serve the country with this aim. Rumors that he will join Guangxi are not true. (20th Shenshi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to a letter received here today from the German Church in Hengzhou, dated June 17, the overall situation is normal. The perilous motor vehicle route southward from the city was restored on June 16. British reporter Samson is scheduled to depart from Hankou tomorrow, traveling to Guangzhou via Hunan Province. The journey will pass through areas occupied by the Southwestern armies, and is therefore quite dangerous. It is noted that Mr. Samson was arrested by the Japanese authorities after the Tokyo military coup in February of this year, and later resided in Shanghai. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Army Reinforces the Jiangxi Border</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Guangdong continues to reinforce the Jiangxi border, actively preparing for war. Zhang Ruigui's division has arbitrarily taken grain from the disaster relief county granary in Anyuan for military rations. The provincial party headquarters has telegraphed Guangdong to request a halt. Various counties in Jiujiang have telegraphed Guangdong, requesting a speedy withdrawal of troops and rapid cessation of hostilities. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Although the Guangdong army entering Hunan recently declared a withdrawal, the Guangdong army originally stationed in Jiangxi only consisted of the First Division and two independent brigades. Recently, the Seventh Division has also been added, and there have also been troop increases in the Dongjiang area. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Guangdong army has invaded Fujian Province. Merchants from the provincial capital, Hong Kong, and Chaozhou-Shantou are concerned that the Guangdong army will clash with the central government's forces and have stopped ordering goods. (20th Shenshi News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Deploys Defense in Dongjiang</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang is very busy deploying defense in the Dongjiang area. The Seventh Division, under Tan Langxing, has been ordered to advance towards Xunwu and Pingyuan. The Eighth Division Commander, Ye Shouyao, returned to the province from Heyuan on the evening of the 18th to meet with Chen for instructions. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul General in Guangdong Lodges Another Protest Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Strictly Orders Investigation and Arrest of Smuggling Criminals</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The government has promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Smuggling of Customs Duties, which stipulates extremely severe punishments for smugglers and accessories. However, according to reports, there are still unrepentant traitors who collude with foreign vagrants or are used by them to engage in smuggling. The Ministry of Finance has now issued a special order to anti-smuggling personnel to focus on investigating and arresting smugglers in addition to investigating and seizing smuggled goods. Once arrested, the criminals should be sent to military or judicial organs at any time for punishment according to law. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Smuggling Affects Foreign Debt</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesperson for the Customs Administration said that after the government clearly stipulated severe punishment measures for smuggling problems, there are indeed fewer uncooperative elements selling smuggled goods. However, the fundamental source of smuggling is still rampant. Several locations along the Jinpu and Pinghan lines have not yet been established, but they can be organized soon. Ansier is still in the Tianjin and Beiping area, responsible for liaising. The strict organization of trade associations in various places to curb private sales is proceeding well. Furthermore, he said that if this continues, it will be impossible to stop it and will inevitably affect foreign debt guarantees. The Inspector General of Customs has long paid attention to this matter. Governments of various countries have successively lodged serious protests with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs due to interests, but as of now, there is no conclusion. As for whether the Ministry of Finance will delay the payment of foreign debt because of this, it is still under consideration. If smuggling does not stop, it will inevitably lead to a situation where it will be impossible to repay in the future. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Question of the Limits of International Obligations</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>Since the sanctions against Italy failed, the various European countries have lost confidence in collective peace. The withdrawal of sanctions against Italy and the amendment of the League of Nations' articles have become the main issues of the League of Nations' Extraordinary Assembly at the end of this month. The London newspapers have recently been talking about the limits of international obligations. The Liberal Party's News Chronicle says that once the current sanctions are lifted, the British government's obligations on the Rhine and in the Mediterranean can be determined, and its obligations elsewhere in Europe can be abandoned. The Conservative Party's Morning Post says that for the present, the military obligations that the countries concerned can assume should be determined, and the extent to which the countries concerned are prepared to go to war in certain areas must be clearly specified. From this kind of argument, it is very clear that Britain has no intention of collective peace and only hopes for local safety.</p>
<p>But is local peace possible? Is a limited international obligation effective? The Rhine is the border of England, this is Baldwin's famous saying. Gibraltar, via the Suez to India, is the lifeline of the British Empire, this is Calvin's warning. If the British want to ensure the peace of this border and the safety of this lifeline, they should contact France, Germany, Russia, and Italy. These four countries are the great powers of the world, not countries in the western corner of Europe or the Mediterranean. The current peace problem is not about an inch of land on the Rhine or an island in the Mediterranean. In other words, peace is a world problem, a whole problem. For example, if Germany and Russia have a conflict in Eastern Europe, Britain may want to strictly maintain neutrality because Ukraine has no direct connection with it. However, if Russia and France are allied and Russia is invaded, then France and Germany will inevitably enter a state of war. Where is the peace in the Rhine area? How can Britain limit its obligations?</p>
<p>Moreover, Britain is not a single country. Not only are its colonies spread all over the world, but its autonomous dominions have also become great powers. Only overall peace and universal security can ensure that the empire's connection is not severed. Otherwise, for the sake of their own security, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and other countries will inevitably seek their own interests. Can the empire avoid disintegration? As far as London is concerned, sending troops to the Far East or sending a fleet to Africa is inevitably costly and harmful. However, as far as the countries such as Australia and South Africa are concerned, when Britain uses troops on the Rhine, is it not foolish for the troops of Australia and South Africa to expedition to the European continent to help the mother country? Even in terms of economic sanctions, if its nature is not worldwide but a partial action of the British Empire, then the autonomous dominions are unwilling to suffer this kind of economic loss. It can be asserted that universal collective peace is the only good medicine to maintain the empire. Countries that violate this principle will not express enthusiasm and support for London's policies.</p>
<p>The difficulty of the current peace problem lies in the excessively small international obligations of various countries, and in the disloyalty of various countries to international articles. Now, because of a single failure, they also abandon this international obligation and despise this international goal. It can also be said to be very unwise. As the saying goes, people who do not have long-term considerations will have immediate worries. Now the peace in the Far East has reached the most serious stage. Hong Kong and Singapore are very vulnerable to the threat of invasion. How can Britain limit its international obligations?</p>

<h3>Ambassador Kawagoe Embarks for China, Upholding the Development of North China's Economy</h3>
<p>Believing it Opens a Path to Sino-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>Arrives in Shanghai on the 22nd to Meet with Kuwajima First</p>
<p>Kobe: The newly appointed Ambassador to China, Kawagoe, embarked for his post on the Asama Maru at noon on the 20th, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Rango, and Secretary Yoshida. According to his words to people on the ship, "To open Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations, we should first develop the economy of North China. This means that North China is now best suited to start economic cooperation. However, economic diplomacy is not intended for political issues. I believe that if it is only economic, it cannot be called political. Since politics is to seek the stability of the people's lives, Japan's newly advocated economic policy should belong to the active ones. As for the policy towards China, it is not for personal purposes, so for Chiang Kai-shek and other people, we should first engage in criticism with a calm and objective attitude, and then take active action. In the end, although the China problem is complicated, it can also obtain a glimmer of hope." (20th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ambassador to China Kawagoe boarded the Asama Maru from Kobe today and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd.

<p>(Nanjing) The government hosted the banking community at the Prime Minister's official residence at noon on the 20th to exchange views on the new reform policy of establishing a new administration. On the same day, they also exchanged views on China policy as the focus, each with their own views. It is learned that the main opinions of the banking group are as follows:</p>
<p>The "Special Trade Problem" in North China is a problem that the Japanese government should pay attention to, and concrete countermeasures should be established as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The issue of Chinese silver nationalization contains the relationship between Indian silver, Chinese silver, and the market price of silver in big countries, which can cause various problems, so it should not be focused on solely on Chinese silver, it seems that vigilance should be exercised.</p>
<p>The foreign trade problem is that Australia and other grain countries have set up tariff barriers to prevent the progress of Japanese trade, so trade with Australia is quite unsmooth, and for the trade with China related to this, appropriate methods must be requested, and the government should establish this countermeasure from this.</p>
<p>The visit of Sir Otto Niemeyer, it is said that China will bring the three major banks together into a central bank, and the rumor is that Britain and Japan will jointly aid it, what is the truth, please ask the Prime Minister to explain.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hirota replied as follows: It seems that China's banks have politicians as their background to maintain management, so it is urgent to change them to be unified by the central bank, which is still a very difficult problem.</p>
<p>After the Prime Minister replied, people in the banking community made benevolent comments on the various other policies planned by the government. The meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM. (20th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Unified Tax Collection Agency</h3>
<p>Hunan, Jiangxi, and Other Provinces Vigorously Change to Establish Tax Bureaus</p>
<p>Candidates for Director of the Tax Bureau Have All Been Internally Decided</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The tax collection agencies under the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance originally consisted of the Tax Bureau, the Stamp and Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and the Mining Tax Collection Commissioner. In order to adjust their organization, Finance Minister Kong has presented and been approved by the Executive Yuan to unify their institutions and change them to tax collection bureaus, responsible for handling the collection of consolidated tax, stamp tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, and mineral tax. However, because the matter is a new initiative, it has been decided to pilot it first in the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Hubei, Henan, and Sichuan starting from July 1st. The remaining provinces will still follow the current system. The above-mentioned five provinces will be divided into the Hunan-Jiangxi District, the Hubei-Henan District, and the Sichuan District. The candidates for director of the tax bureaus in the three districts have all been internally decided and are mostly transferred from the original tax personnel in the five provinces. After the establishment of the tax bureaus in the three districts, the original Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi District Consolidated Tax Bureau, Consolidated Tax Management Office, Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and Mining Tax Collection Commissioner in the three districts will all be abolished and reorganized in accordance with the tax bureau's organizational regulations.

<h3>Central Government Finances Guangdong's Currency Reform</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) It is further learned today that the central government and Guangdong province seem to have reached a degree of unity on financial issues. It is expected that if there are no political incidents to hinder it, Guangdong province can implement the "Dayuan" as the currency unit in accordance with the national currency system by September of this year.

It is reported that part of this silver will be used to purchase 30 million "Dayuan" banknotes from the central government.

<h3>Reasons for the Authorities to Close Down Two Newspaper Offices in Nanjing</h3>

<h3>Li Siguang Researches Anhui Province's Geology</h3>
<p>Investigating Till Deposits in Huangshan</p>
<p>Dating Back Approximately 50,000 Years</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After returning to China from Europe, Li Siguang, Director of the Geological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, went to Huangshan, Anhui Province, to continue investigating glacial till deposits and has now returned to Nanjing after completing the work. He obtained many specimens of stone flakes containing clear striations and layered mud. The striations were formed by ancient ice blocks, and the layered mud was the result of meltwater. Research has confirmed that these are ancient glacial till deposits belonging to the Quaternary Period, dating back approximately 50,000 years. According to geological experts, the discovery of glacial till in China was first made in Lushan. At that time, Chinese and foreign geological experts went to survey, but the results were not clearly proven and could not be believed. This time, after Li Siguang's re-investigation, all doubts can be dispelled. Now that the geology of the glacial till layer has been proven in both Jiangxi and Anhui, it can be inferred that its distribution area must extend to the entire country. (20th Dispatch)</p>

Later, Zhao's guarantor was questioned and claimed that he had recently sold several fans for Zhao to the Shuangxingyuan Antique Shop outside the back door. The shop was inspected and three fans from the Palace Museum were indeed found. However, the shop strongly denied that they were sold by Zhao and falsely claimed that they were purchased from a peddler. The authorities have taken custody of the items and ordered the person in charge of the shop to await summons. It is reported that the thieves have fled to Changxindian, and the Public Security Bureau has sent police officers to investigate. As of 12:00 PM on the 20th, they had not yet been arrested. In order to solve the case quickly, the Public Security Bureau has offered a substantial reward for the arrest of the fugitives. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Measures for Arresting Chinese Suspects in the Case of British Ship HMS "Gandy" Seizing Opium</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the case of the British ship HMS "Gandy" seizing smuggled opium in Hankou last year, after negotiations by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in addition to the captain of the ship burning the smuggled opium under the supervision of both parties, as for the Chinese suspects involved, the British naval authorities have also ordered the captains of all ships to hand over all Chinese suspects involved in such cases to the Chinese authorities for legal action if the Chinese authorities present formal arrest warrants. The seized opium must be burned or discarded on the ship. However, currently, opium-related cases are adjudicated by military law organs. When the prosecutor of the competent court receives an application for an arrest warrant from the military law organ, they shall immediately issue an arrest warrant and hand it over to the original investigating personnel to board the ship to arrest the suspect. After the arrest, the suspect will still be tried by the competent military law organ according to law. However, the reasons for the application and the evidence of the crime must be stated, and the prosecutor's command must be followed in accordance with Articles 209 and 210 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The Ministry of Justice issued an order to all high courts on the 20th to comply with these measures. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>French Premier Notifies Italian Ambassador of Decision to Lift Sanctions, Proposes Collective Security Implementation Plan, US Maintains Independent Action Policy</h3>
<p>(Paris) Premier Léon Blum met with Italian Ambassador Cerruti this afternoon and informed him that the French government has decided to lift the current sanctions. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The government has sent a general proposal for the implementation of collective security to Ambassador Coullpain in the United Kingdom and Ambassador de Chambrun in Italy, instructing them to forward it to the governments of their respective countries. This proposal is of a provisional nature and will not become an official document until the countries concerned have responded. It is also unknown whether it will be submitted for discussion at the League of Nations General Assembly meeting on the 30th of this month. The main points explain that there is no need to revise the League of Nations Covenant and include the following proposals:</p>
<p>When Article 11 of the Covenant (i.e., those who control war or the threat of war) is implemented, the countries concerned shall not participate in the vote.</p>
<p>The sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant do not necessarily require full implementation by all member states, but countries with a direct geographical interest shall take military sanctions.</p>
<p>The countries concerned shall conclude regional mutual assistance agreements so that countries with a direct geographical interest can stipulate the obligations to be assumed in advance.</p>
<p>French policy is still based on the principles of the Covenant. (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Mr. Spears, regarding the impeachment motion against the government to be discussed when the debate on foreign policy continues in the House of Commons next Tuesday, submitted an amendment today and was seconded by seventeen other MPs who support the government. The amendment urges the government to instruct the British representative attending the League of Nations General Assembly meeting to declare that Britain will never support Italy's invasion of Abyssinia and opposes allowing Italy to raise debts in Britain as a price for Italy's willingness to cooperate in Europe. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The League of Nations Association held a meeting in Scarborough today and passed an emergency resolution expressing deep regret over the British government's decision to propose the abolition of sanctions against Italy. The motion was proposed by the association's president, Viscount Cecil, and stated that the so-called sanctions had not actually been fully implemented. It also requested that members use all constitutional methods to urge the government to rescind the above decision. Another resolution requested that the government not recognize Italy's annexation of Abyssinia and not lend money to Italy or provide other financial assistance, and that a proposal be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly meeting on June 30, requesting that other member states take the same action. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the Cabinet decided to abolish sanctions against Italy, the League of Nations Association and other groups held a large meeting in Scarborough and strongly criticized it. The chairman, former League of Nations representative Lord Cecil, proposed an emergency motion, stating that the government's decision to propose the abolition of current sanctions was regrettable and "it is hoped that members of this association will use methods permitted by the Constitution to force the government to withdraw its order." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is reported that any decision by the League of Nations to lift sanctions against Italy will not affect the financial and arms embargoes imposed by the United States on Italy and Abyssinia last year. President Roosevelt has repeatedly stated decisively that these embargoes have nothing to do with the League of Nations. According to close advisors to President Roosevelt, the president is unwilling to end the above embargoes until it is independently determined that the war throughout Abyssinia has ceased.

<h3>Italian Officials Claim Great Comfort Among the People of Rome</h3>
<p>Economic Retaliation Plan Will Also Be Lifted</p>
<p>(Rome) According to official statements, people in Rome were greatly comforted by British Foreign Secretary Eden's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday that the government was prepared to lift sanctions against Italy and believed that there was hope for the future. It was also stated that once sanctions against Italy are actually lifted, the economic retaliation plan adopted by Italy will also be lifted at the same time. Once ordinary friendship is restored, resentment should be released, and no further attempts at retaliation should be made. (19th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official sources declared that although the British government has decided to lift sanctions, it has not yet been implemented. Therefore, Italy will maintain its original attitude when the League of Nations Council and General Assembly meet in Geneva at the end of this month and does not plan to send representatives to attend. Semi-official sources also said, "Once the sanctions disappear, the counter-sanctions taken by Italy will inevitably disappear as well. Since the implementation of economic sanctions, Italian industry has developed greatly, but Italy is unwilling to rely on this advantage to take a hostile attitude towards any country that participated in the sanctions after the sanctions are lifted." These people also said, "Italian people were very satisfied with the speech given by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons yesterday, as Britain has virtually recognized Italy's military and political victory, and the claim that a government still exists within Abyssinia has also been disproved. Italy looks forward to the future and is more confident." (19th Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign Minister Count Ciano met with German Ambassador Hassel this afternoon to discuss matters. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the Cabinet approved the lifting of sanctions against Italy, various newspapers commented on it, but did not find it strange. Figaro reporter Dolmeison declared that lifting sanctions against Italy is one thing, recognizing Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is another, and revising the League of Nations Covenant is another. Although these are logically interrelated, the League of Nations should not discuss them at the same time, or confusion will ensue. Le Matin stated that British and French policies are clearly different. Britain wants to leave the issue of collective security for discussion at the League of Nations General Assembly in September so that this issue can be linked to the revision of the League of Nations Covenant. In France, the issue of strengthening the collective security system will be raised at the League of Nations Council meeting on the 26th of this month. In addition, Britain believes that the obligations contained in the League of Nations Covenant are too burdensome and should be reduced by having the countries concerned conclude regional agreements. France believes that regional agreements and the Covenant should run parallel. Ms. Tabui, a reporter for L'Oeuvre, declared that "After the lifting of sanctions against Italy, the international security mechanism should still be universal in nature and should not be organized by region. Britain is now planning to revise the League of Nations Covenant, and its purpose is to abolish Article 16 (regarding sanctions) and reduce the power of the collective security mechanism, which France will naturally oppose." (20th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech in the House of Commons yesterday, advocating the lifting of sanctions, is quite inconsistent with his previous policies, and the League of Nations was shaken by the news. It is said that the key to the international situation from now on lies in the issue of reorganizing the League of Nations. Regarding this, the countries of the Little Entente will once again declare their unwavering loyalty to the League of Nations Covenant and demand that the effectiveness of Article 16 (regarding sanctions) of the Covenant be enhanced, and that mandatory pacifism be promoted. It seems that Britain should also try to restore the authority of the League of Nations. As for the countries of South America, with the exception of Argentina and Mexico, the other countries may demand a thorough revision of the Covenant based on the conclusion of regional conventions. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Spanish representative to the League of Nations, Madariaga, is now here. It is generally speculated that he is here to consult with British politicians on the issue of lifting sanctions. However, Spanish sources say that Madariaga came to England for private affairs and is not on any mission. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Finance Minister Announces Fiscal Policy; Opposes Devaluing Currency; Lower House Passes Bill</h3>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Auriol, in a speech to the Chamber of Deputies today, opposed devaluing the currency, stating that the only feasible policy for the government at present is to implore the entire nation to save the country and its finances. He has proposed a bill stipulating punishments for depositing funds abroad after a specific deadline, strictly prohibiting any actions detrimental to the nation, reorganizing the Bank of France, and simplifying public finances. He also stated that private banks will not be nationalized but will be subject to state control to prevent irregularities. The government will soon issue short-term bonds with very small denominations, making them accessible to everyone. He will also request loans from the Bank of France for the government, but he hopes not to use the bank's loans if the public enthusiastically purchases "Baby Bonds". It is estimated that since January 1st of last year, French capital flowing abroad has reached 26,000,000,000 francs. Currently, the amount of francs stored privately is 36,000,000,000. The budget deficit for 1936 is nearly 6 to 7,000,000,000 francs. From June to December of this year, the government needs 15,000,000,000 francs. During this period, the government must issue 840,000,000 francs of treasury bills. It is reported that the Bank of France has agreed to lend 14,000,000,000 francs. Since 1932, permanent public debt has decreased by 44,000,000,000 francs, but repayable debt has increased by 75,000,000,000 francs. Short-term debt has increased to 32,500,000,000 francs, and current debt has increased to 66,000,000,000 francs. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies has recently passed a draft law with a large majority of 340 to 208 votes. The main points are two: Firstly, the government signed an agreement with the Bank of France yesterday, stipulating that 14,000,000,000 francs of ordinary treasury bills rediscounted by the Bank of France between 1933 and 1936 will be converted into a temporary loan from the Bank of France to the government. Secondly, the bank will lend the government another 10,000,000,000 francs, of which 6,000,000,000 francs will be allocated within the year to subscribe to new short-term treasury bills to meet the government's urgent needs. This agreement has now been approved by the Chamber of Deputies. The circulating amount of ordinary treasury bills is also specified in the bill. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Auriol delivered a speech in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, reporting on the financial situation. The first half of the speech was reported in a previous telegram. The second half is supplemented as follows: The Finance Minister refuted the policy of franc devaluation, saying that this policy is merely wishful thinking. All of our citizens should seek ways to save themselves. According to my knowledge, the amount of French capital fleeing abroad is as much as 26,000,000,000 francs, and the amount in private hoards is as much as 30,000,000,000 francs. Therefore, the total intangible economic loss to the nation is around 60,000,000,000 francs. The government has now decided that from now until July 15th, there will be an amnesty period. All individuals should report the amount of funds stored abroad to the authorities during this period. Anyone who intends to evade and fails to report within the deadline will have their assets confiscated, with the amount being equal to the amount concealed, and will be stripped of their civil rights. In addition, the government will also negotiate with other countries to devise ways to curb capital flight and tax evasion. It is important to know that the government has decided to reject the implementation of a devaluation policy, and only economic recovery can promote the return of capital to the country. Therefore, economic recovery is the government's primary goal. The Finance Minister is determined to ask the French people to unite and express their trust in the government, and said that the government will, together with various experts, take various measures to maintain the securities market. The method is divided into two major steps: The first step is to issue small-denomination short-term treasury bonds to distribute throughout the national market, and to have various banks and public officials affiliated with the postal financial services cooperate in promoting sales. Before these treasury bonds are sold out, the government will openly request the Bank of France to allow overdrafts. If the people of the whole country can enthusiastically contribute and fulfill their national obligations, then the government will naturally not have to implement overdrafts. However, I will use them within the necessary range. All those who subscribe to treasury bonds have the right to supervise. The government also intends to submit to the National Assembly a bill to reform the accounting system of public institutions in accordance with the outline proposed by the Court of Audit. The second step is to reform the current credit system and propose a draft law to reorganize the Bank of France. This is because the government has no intention of placing the bank under government control; the reason is only to have the bank manage all economic benefits. In addition, the government does not intend to nationalize the banks, but only to control them, so as to eliminate malpractices and restore good order. As for the tax system, it should be fair, simple, and easy to collect, and it is not intended to levy special taxes on wealthy households. Efforts must be made to reduce market interest rates, and a "clearing check" system is planned to be adopted. This is what some economists, including the economists of the Radical Socialist Party, advocate. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Auriol, after giving a speech in the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, will soon submit several draft laws to the Chamber. The main points are as follows: French people's funds deposited abroad must be reported to the government before July 15th and must not be concealed. Failure to report within the deadline will be severely punished. The Minister of Finance is authorized to propose punishments for those who attempt to undermine national credit. The cabinet is authorized to issue orders placing all domestic economic benefits under the management of the Bank of France and to reform the accounting system of public institutions. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Finance Minister Auriol has decided to appoint a committee to draft a reorganization plan for the Bank of France. It is generally known that representatives from the colonies will also participate in this committee. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Finance Minister Auriol delivered his financial speech yesterday, the franc exchange market has felt a positive impact. All foreign exchange rates and gold prices (relative to the franc) have fallen. The pound sterling has fallen from 76 francs 42 centimes to 76 francs. The London gold price has fallen to 238.9 shillings per ounce, which is the lowest price since March. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) French Finance Minister Auriol delivered an important official speech in the National Assembly this afternoon, reporting on the financial situation. The franc exchange market felt a positive impact, rising from 76 francs 64 centimes (equivalent to one pound) to 76 francs 25 centimes. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Chancellor States It Is Inappropriate to Invest Long-Term Abroad</h3>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain sent a letter to the chairman of the Stock Exchange Committee a week ago. The letter was published today, stating that, in his judgment, it is currently inconvenient for Britain to invest large sums of long-term capital abroad. He also stated that large amounts of short-term money are now flowing into London from abroad, which may conceal the original factors of Britain's position. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Signatory Nations of the Treaty of Lausanne to Convene in Switzerland</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Re-Fortification of the Turkish Straits</p>
<p>(London) The signatory nations of the Treaty of Lausanne are scheduled to hold a meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, on the 22nd of this month to discuss the re-fortification of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits. Turkish Ambassador Fethi recently visited the Foreign Office to meet with senior officials and discuss the meeting. It is reported that Turkey is requesting that, after the re-fortification of the two straits in the future, the tonnage of warships permitted to pass must be restricted and not allowed to pass freely as they currently do. Specifically, the strongest fleet in the Black Sea is currently the Soviet fleet, with a total tonnage of 50,000 tons. In the future, the total tonnage of warships from various countries passing through the two straits should be limited to 50,000 tons. However, it is feared that Britain will express dissent regarding this matter. In addition, Italy is currently refusing to attend meetings of the League of Nations Council and Assembly because sanctions have not yet been lifted. Therefore, Italy will also be unable to participate in the Montreux meeting. However, if the League of Nations Assembly passes a resolution to lift sanctions during this session, Italy may be able to attend the Montreux meeting in time. If so, the scope of the meeting may be expanded to include the coastal countries of the Mediterranean. As for the issue of lifting sanctions, since Britain has already initiated it, Turkey, though unwilling in its heart, will ultimately follow suit. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<h3>European Labor Unrest Spreads</h3>
<p>Belgian Labor and Management Compromise, Britain Launches</p>
<p>Spanish Bloodshed, Lithuanian Martial Law</p>
<p>Brussels The Belgian general strike, involving 400,000 people, is expected to end soon because the three main demands of the workers have reached a compromise in principle. The three conditions are: paid vacation; minimum daily wage of 22 francs; and recognition of labor unions. The employers' opinions on the demand for a 40-hour work week remain inconsistent. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Brussels The cabinet discussed the labor unrest problem yesterday afternoon. The Minister of Labor reported that the hotel, restaurant, and food industry unions in the capital have reached agreements with the employers' associations, respectively. Dockworkers have also reached a compromise with the employers. In addition, the Ministry of Interior issued a notice on the 18th of this month, warning foreign workers not to join demonstrations or assist others in causing trouble, otherwise they will be deported regardless of the severity of the circumstances. The cabinet has approved this measure. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Antwerp, Belgium Prime Minister Zeeland has proposed a suggestion to the striking workers, advocating an increase in wages of 12 Belgian francs per day. The workers have indicated that they will accept it and will resume work on Monday morning. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Brussels Since the new Zeeland cabinet came to power, the labor unrest has expanded and gradually spread throughout the country. Conflicts are heard daily. The six socialist members of the cabinet have announced that if the labor unrest is not resolved within the next few days, they plan to submit draft laws on social issues to the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday (the 23rd) to end the labor unrest. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Eclipse Observation Results: Our Team in Japan Achieves Great Success in Observation Work</h3>
<p>American and Russian Radio Observation Teams Have the Most Gains</p>
<p>All Materials Must Be Studied for Ten Years Before Disclosure</p>
<p>Shikashika Most of the eclipse observation teams from various countries observing the eclipse here yesterday did not achieve their goals. However, it is very gratifying that Yu Qingsong, director of the Chinese Nanjing Astronomical Observatory, and Ms. Zou Yixin, who jointly observed with Dr. Shibata of the Japanese Kyoto Astronomical Observatory, achieved great success in their observation work. The teams from various countries were equipped with large-scale instruments and machines, and the equipment was complete. However, the Chinese team had a small number of people and incomplete instruments. Under these circumstances, Yu and Zou devoted all their efforts and prepared enthusiastically, and as a result, they were able to achieve their goals. Ms. Zou happily told reporters, "Since we came to Japan, we have been fortunate to receive guidance from Mr. Shibata and have been able to achieve success. We are extremely grateful." (Domei News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The chairman of the Academy of Sciences Committee reported the results of the eclipse observation. Soviet and foreign scientists collected rich materials for the scientific study of the solar atmosphere. The most successful were the Soviet and American radio observation teams. The Krasnodar stratosphere balloon ascended to 4,100 meters, stayed in the air for one hour and 27 minutes, and photographed 1,000 images of the sun. In Poli, due to the bad climate, the solar corona and spectroscopic photography equipment were taken from an airplane at an altitude of 4,100 meters. (TASS, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet and British, Japanese and Polish observation teams in Omsk were completely successful. The Pulkovo observation team took 32 photographs of the solar corona, the British scientists took 24, and the Japanese took 9. The American, French, and Soviet observation teams in Kustanai, and the Soviet and Swedish observation teams in Troebka, had no results due to bad weather. The Soviet, American, Italian, and Czech observation teams in the Shalala-Akbulak area had satisfactory results. At the Kubyshev State Astronomical Institute in the Far East, the team studying Einstein's effects completed its entire plan and took 14 photographs. (TASS, 20th)</p>
<p>Shikashika Shen, director of the Shanghai Science Institute, and Feng Gan, professor at Peking University, of the Chinese eclipse observation team who came to Japan, departed from here on the 20th. Only Dr. Feng will fly directly from Kobe and return to Peking immediately. The others, such as Yu, director of the Nanjing Astronomical Observatory, and others, will visit the Oblique Star in Shanghai on the 20th and then return to China via Tokyo on the second day of next month. (Domei News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Abashiri According to Dr. Hayatome, the overall situation of the results of this eclipse observation will be known as early as three years later, and the correct results will be announced after several decades. The changes in celestial bodies recorded in the short time of two minutes require long-term research, because the correct solution is the most important thing in scientific problems.

<h3>US Naval Circles Advocate Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>Blockading the Seas to Stop Wars</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Naval Institute, in an article published in its Sea Power magazine today, advocated Anglo-American cooperation in blockading the seas to stop international wars. The article has attracted attention from all parties, because the association had previously been indifferent to Britain and advocated maintaining a large navy to make American foreign policy more independent. However, the article declares that Anglo-American cooperation is indeed necessary, because in this time of rampant violence and declining justice, only superior strength is sufficient to stop the ambitions of warmongering nations. This force has long existed, and it depends on its constituent members being able to cooperate candidly. Land wars between countries are difficult to interfere with, but sea wars are easy to control. We very much hope to choose one of the two paths of participating in war or preventing war. (National Gazette, 19th)</p>
<h3>Philippine National Defense Plan</h3>

<p>Manila The US military commissioner stationed in the Philippines, former US Army Chief of Staff MacArthur, has submitted a Philippine national defense plan to the Philippine Congress, which includes: the need for fast boats equipped with torpedoes; air defense; and the implementation of universal military training. It will be completed in ten years and will cost 80 million US dollars, including a regular army, a reserve army, and an air force and a marine division. Once this procedure is completed, those who want to attack the Philippines must pay a huge price in people and money, and even the most violent and powerful will be daunted. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Manila General MacArthur, the Philippine military advisor, submitted a thirty-year national defense plan to the Federal Assembly on the 19th. The contents are as follows: Army: Implement a conscription system, recruit 40,000 soldiers, and after 30 years of training, the total number of active-duty reservists will reach 1.2 million. Navy: Build 50 to 100 fast mine boats to form a patrol fleet. Air Force: Equip 250 bombers and fighters. (Domei News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>US Third Party Appears</h3>
<p>Republican Congressman Lemke</p>
<p>Announces Candidacy for President</p>
<p>(Washington) Another presidential candidate has appeared in the United States. The person is Congressman Lemke from North Dakota, age 58, a graduate of Yale University, who initially practiced law. From 1917 to 1921, he served as a member of the Executive Committee of the National Nonpartisan League, and later served as the Attorney General of North Dakota. He is almost entirely related to various agricultural groups in the Southwest. He is married and has three children. It is now announced that he will be the presidential candidate of the new "Union Party." (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The long-rumored third party in the United States has become a reality today with the announcement of Republican Congressman Lemke as the presidential candidate of the Union Party. Father Coughlin will give a nationwide broadcast speech tonight, explaining his own position and that of the American Justice Union. It is generally expected that he will unconditionally recognize Lemke as the presidential candidate and order members of the Justice Union to support the party's election campaign. In addition, Smith's Share Our Wealth Society may also assist the Union Party. When announcing his candidacy for president, Lemke declared, "I have accepted the challenge of the reactionary elements of the two old political parties due to popular demand." O'Brien has expressed his willingness to be the party's vice presidential candidate.

<h3>Kong's Proposal for Revision of the Salt Administration Organizational Law</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan passed the second revision of the organizational laws of the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration on the 19th, both adopting Minister Kong's original proposal with further revisions. However, regarding the salt administration, the articles in the organizational law of the General Office that restrict ministerial orders, Kong's original proposal for revision argued that it should not be stipulated because the office is an external affiliated agency, not within the ministry, and its nature is different from that of the Customs Administration. It only has the responsibility to carry out ministerial orders and should not include articles in the organizational law of the office that restrict ministerial orders, thereby undermining the spirit of affiliation. Therefore, the original proposal requested that Article 23 of the organizational law of the office be deleted. It is now learned that the organizational law of the Salt Administration General Office, as revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan, still follows the provisions of the organizational laws of the Customs Administration for this article and has not been deleted, which seems to differ from the original proposal. It is heard that the provisions of this article are quite suitable for actual needs, and the ministry is currently studying it. (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Science and Technology Discussions</h3>
<p>— Editor-in-Chief of the Science Society of China</p>
<p>Locust Xingcun</p>
<p>Locusts are a very important agricultural pest in our country. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, locusts plagued Shandong Province, affecting seven million disaster victims. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the losses suffered by reeds along the coast and lake areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shandong provinces due to locusts were valued at around 100 million yuan. According to a survey conducted by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, the area of crops damaged by locusts nationwide that year totaled 6,863,033 mu, valued at 14,779,213 yuan in national currency. The average loss per mu was about two yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Identifying Locusts Locusts belong to the class Insecta, order Orthoptera, and family Acrididae. They have a pair of strong teeth (known as mandibles in entomology), which are weapons for feeding on plants. Locusts differ from common grasshoppers in that their wings are very long, exceeding one-third of the abdominal end. The wing length of ordinary grasshoppers is not as long as the abdominal end or is only slightly longer than the abdomen.</p>
<p>The Fallacy of Spontaneous Generation of Locusts Hundreds of years ago, some biologists and many people without biological knowledge believed that living things could be transformed from non-living things, which is the so-called theory of spontaneous generation. Later, after many biologists such as Redi, Spallanzani, Tyndall, and Pasteur used experimental methods to prove this, this incorrect theory had no basis. Regarding the origin of locusts, there are similar legends in our country. For example, it is said that locusts can be transformed from grass seeds, dung, and other things. It is also said that fish roe and shrimp roe can turn into locusts. These are all caused by speculation or incorrect observations.</p>
<p>The Life Cycle of a Locust Locusts are insects with gradual metamorphosis, meaning that during their development, they go through three stages: egg, nymph (commonly known as "grasshopper nymph"), and adult (locust). Locusts have two generations per year (sometimes two and a half generations) and overwinter in the egg stage. (Locust eggs are laid in the soil in clusters, each containing several to over a hundred eggs.) Nymphs are small with short wings. After molting five times, they gradually grow larger and become flying locusts.</p>
<p>Both locusts and nymphs feed on plants of the grass family. (Nymphs often eat more tender plants.) The most preferred foods are reeds, rice leaves, sorghum, millet leaves, corn leaves and stems, and pasture grass leaves. Less commonly eaten are potato leaves, tobacco leaves, melon leaves, and lettuce leaves. However, when food is scarce, they will eat anything. Because locusts love to eat reeds, the coastal areas from Hebei Province to northern Jiangsu Province, the banks of the Yellow River, the silted Yellow River, the Huai River, the banks of the Yangtze River and the lower reaches of the Qiantang River, and the surroundings of lakes such as Weishan Lake and Hongze Lake are all areas where locusts frequently occur. (These areas are rich in reeds.)</p>
<p>Nymphs have the habit of migrating in groups but cannot fly. Their migration direction is determined by sunlight, so they move east in the morning and west in the afternoon. The reason for migration is due to phototaxis and thermotaxis. The reason for grouping is that adult locusts lay egg clusters close together. The nymphs after hatching naturally gather together into small groups. During migration, neighboring small groups disturb each other and merge into a large group. Flying locusts also have the habit of migrating in groups. Because they have developed wings, they can fly far. There are many individuals in a locust swarm, so crops are severely damaged wherever they pass. Therefore, the poem "Flying Locusts" by Guo Dun of the Ming Dynasty says, "Flying locusts cover the sky, the sun is colorless. Old farmers in the field shed tears of blood. They tug at their clothes and stamp their feet, unable to catch them. Large leaves are completely gone, small branches are broken." The degree of their devastation is evident. According to Sydow's research, the speed of locust migration is one league every four hours, equivalent to twelve Chinese miles. As for the reason for migration, some say it is due to the influence of external factors, such as migrating in search of food due to food shortages. However, this theory is highly unreliable. A more reasonable explanation is physiological. Although locusts have reached the adult stage, their reproductive organs must mature after a certain number of days. Psspelov said that if a locust whose reproductive organs have not yet matured undertakes a long migration, it is enough to promote the early maturation of the reproductive organs because when flying locusts fly, their body temperature increases, which enhances the oxidation of fat and other stored nutrients, indirectly increasing the materials needed for the development of the reproductive organs.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of Locusts Records of locust plagues are frequently found in ancient Chinese books. If we carefully examine the previous records, we can understand that locusts do not cause disasters every year. Major outbreaks occur every five to six to twelve years. It can be seen that major locust outbreaks are cyclical. Some entomologists, such as Uvarov, believe that locusts themselves can be divided into locust types and grasshopper types. These two types can be mutually transformed. When the environment is suitable, the grasshopper type can be transformed into the locust type. The locust type can migrate in groups and cause major damage. Conversely, when the environment is not suitable, the locust type can be transformed back into the grasshopper type. The grasshopper type cannot migrate in groups and does not cause disasters. Because it takes a considerable amount of time for the grasshopper type to transform into the locust type, there is obviously a cyclical pattern.</p>
<p>The Distribution of Locusts According to statistics from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station in the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, the areas where locusts were distributed in our country that year included Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong, Henan, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shaanxi, Hebei, nine provinces, and Nanjing City, encompassing 265 counties. Geographically, the distribution ranges from 30 degrees north latitude (Shangyu, Zhejiang) to 41 degrees north latitude (Changping, Hebei) and from 107.5 degrees east longitude (Fufeng, Shaanxi) to 121.5 degrees east longitude (Qidong, Jiangsu). In terms of elevation, locusts are most distributed in areas below 50 meters above sea level (such as the locust-producing areas of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hebei, Zhejiang, Shandong, and other provinces). The distribution of locusts varies in number due to the influence of climatic factors in different regions. Mr. Zou Zhonglin divided the areas where locusts occur in our country into three regions based on climatic conditions and the severity of damage: Suitable zone. The annual average isothermal temperature in this area is above 12 degrees Celsius, and the average isohyet is above 400-800 mm. In years when locusts do not reach major outbreaks, locusts can still be found in this area. If the weather is suitable, the number of individuals will increase and cause major damage, and they can migrate to neighboring areas. This region extends from Anxin County in Hebei Province in the north to Linhuai Pass in eastern Anhui Province in the south. Occasional disaster zone. This zone is located outside the suitable zone. Due to the north-south direction, the climatic conditions are slightly different. In the part north of the suitable zone, the annual average isothermal temperature is 10-1200. In the part south of the suitable zone, the annual average isohyet is 800-1000 mm. In prosperous years, it suffers damage from locusts flying from the suitable zone, but locust plagues do not occur every year. Inactive zone. This zone is further outside the occasional disaster zone. The annual average isothermal temperature in the north is below 1000, and the annual average isohyet in the south is above 1000 mm. Locust plagues are usually very rare.</p>
<p>Natural Enemies of Locusts Although locusts are a great enemy of humans, locusts themselves have natural enemies in nature. For example, we sometimes see many locusts or nymphs clinging tightly to reeds and other plants in the wild. Upon closer inspection, they are all dead corpses, which villagers call "hanging plague." This is because they are parasitized by a bacterium that specifically parasitizes the locust's body. This parasitic bacterium can only be active when there is a lot of rain and the air is humid, so the "hanging plague" is not easily found in dry air. Locusts are sometimes killed by other insects. For example, parasitic insects in locust bodies include flesh flies and locusts (also a type of fly), whose larvae feed exclusively on the tissues inside the locust's body. Those that feed on locust eggs include long-snouted flies (a type of fly) and the larvae of weevils (a type of beetle). Those that feed on nymphs include wasps, robber flies, and spider wasps. Birds also eat locusts, such as storks, gulls, crows, magpies, cuckoos, partridges, sparrows, wrens, larks, mountain crows, grouse, shrikes, and owls. In addition, ducks also like to eat nymphs, so some people release ducks to peck at nymphs.</p>
<p>Locust Control Locust control should be timely. For example, during the nymph stage, the wings have not yet grown, so they cannot fly, and capture is extremely convenient. If time is wasted and nymphs are not exterminated, once they turn into flying locusts, they will fly away and be difficult to deal with. Moreover, locusts have migratory properties, so all provinces that produce locusts should work hard to eliminate locusts to achieve the effect of cooperation. The methods of locust control are lengthy and too trivial. Due to space limitations, it is not necessary to repeat them here. However, one point is very important in locust control: the places where locusts occur are mostly wasteland. The reason is that in these wastelands, they are barren all year round and are not cultivated, so the eggs laid by locusts can overwinter safely in the soil and hatch in the following year. If we reclaim all the wasteland, the locust eggs will either be killed by cultivation or eaten by birds or animals after being turned out of the soil, or frozen to death by the severe winter. This will naturally reduce the damage caused by locusts in the following year. The Rocky Mountain locusts in the United States used to be very harmful. Since reclamation, they have decreased and are no longer a major problem. It can be seen that reclamation and locust control have a very close relationship.</p>
<p>Utilization of Locusts We spend a lot of manpower and capture a huge number of locust nymphs, which should be utilized. According to Dr. J. H. Roop's analysis of fresh locusts, the results contain the following components: 68.4% water, 1.94% fat, 25.07% protein, 3.41% fiber, and 1.24% ash. Therefore, locusts are suitable for raising livestock or poultry. Releasing ducks to peck at nymphs is indeed a win-win situation. According to Dr. D. N. Harper's analysis of locusts from a fertilizer perspective, they contain 10.7% nitrogen, 1.52% soluble phosphoric acid, and 0.24% insoluble phosphoric acid. Therefore, locust nymph carcasses are an effective fertilizer that can be used to cultivate crops.</p>

<p>Qingdao Strictly Prohibits Opium and Narcotics</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Narcotics must be eradicated by the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China. Opium must be eradicated by the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Due to its special environment, it is very easy for narcotics to flow into Qingdao. In addition, there are about two hundred Japanese and Korean vagrants in Qingdao who engage in selling narcotics. Therefore, there are more citizens addicted to narcotics than elsewhere. After the municipal government received the order from the National Anti-Opium Bureau to strictly prohibit narcotics, it petitioned the Central Government to designate Qingdao as an absolutely drug-free zone. It also joined forces with the heads of various Central Government agencies stationed in Qingdao and leaders of mass organizations to form a force to eliminate opium addicts. Within the shortest possible time, all opium and narcotics will be completely eliminated. At the same time, the Central Government sent Commissioner Liu Xiaoshu to investigate opium and narcotics. Together with the municipal government, they are working hard to carry out the mission. Narcotics must be eradicated by the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China, and opium must be eradicated by the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China. Those who fail to quit by the deadline will be sentenced to death. Mayor Shen Honglie and Shandong and Qingdao Narcotics Commissioner Liu Xiaoshu have jointly issued a notice, hoping that citizens will wake up and quit as soon as possible to avoid falling into the clutches of the law. The notice is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Notice: The scourge of opium has been around for nearly a century, and narcotics have been prevalent for more than a decade. The harm of opium and narcotics has killed countless people. If it continues to spread, what will be the end? If it is not eradicated in time, our race will be destroyed. Chiang, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission and Director-General of the Anti-Opium Bureau, in view of the severity of the harm of opium and narcotics, has issued articles and orders three times and five times since this year regarding the investigation and prohibition of opium and narcotics. All have been publicly announced on time. Our city has always been strict in the investigation and prohibition of opium and narcotics. Therefore, every year, no less than a thousand cases are sent to the court. And because of the prevalence of narcotics, two drug rehabilitation centers have been set up one after another. The total number of people admitted and rehabilitated has reached more than 6,500. Now, our city has been approved by the Director-General of the Anti-Opium Bureau as an absolutely drug-free zone. Opium must be eradicated by the end of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and narcotics must be eradicated by the end of the 25th year of the Republic of China. From the 26th year of the Republic of China, anyone who manufactures, transports, or sells narcotics, and anyone who uses narcotics or injects morphine, will be sentenced to death. Now, the countdown is less than half a year. Anyone who is addicted to narcotics should wake up in time and quit as soon as possible, or report to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to a drug rehabilitation center for detoxification. This is still a way out. The commissioner has been ordered to come to Qingdao to conduct a general investigation, and the mayor is also responsible for jointly handling it. In addition to the orderly progress of the investigation, this notice is jointly issued to inform all merchants and people in the city. Everyone must abide by it and not violate it. Be sure to follow this notice.</p>
<h3>Revival Trend of Guangdong Silk Industry</h3>
<p>Increasing exports, silk factories are resuming operations one after another. The authorities are formulating a plan to control the silk industry.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: This year, the silk industry in Guangdong Province has greatly improved compared to the past. The first and second crops of silkworms at the beginning of the year were very good, and the price of silk rose again, and silkworm farmers made a profit. The third crop was slightly inferior due to the cold weather and excessive rain. By the time the fourth crop of silkworm cocoons came on the market recently, the silk industry showed signs of recovery again. Various silk filatures in Shunde and Nanhai have resumed operations one after another. In Shunde, Rongqi, Daliang, Guizhou, Ge'an, and other places, eleven silk filatures have been added this year compared to last year. They have also provided loans to silkworm farmers in advance, so that they can grow mulberry trees and raise silkworms. Now, the price of mulberry trees is more expensive than last year, with each hundred jin worth three yuan and five jiao, which is more profitable than other agricultural crops. Therefore, mulberry seedlings have also risen in price accordingly, with each ten thousand plants worth twelve yuan. Various silk factories have recently received orders for silk from foreign merchants one after another, and the price of silk is also becoming more expensive every day. At present, each tael of raw silk is worth three qian and two fen, which is twice as expensive as last year. Various factories are actively investing in more exports to Japan. As a result, mulberry fields and silkworm farmers are gradually restoring their former appearance. The authorities believe that the Guangdong silk industry is reviving, and they are afraid that merchants will damage their credibility with foreign countries. They plan to first control the silk industry's foreign trade. The Silk Improvement Bureau is drafting a plan. In the first year (i.e., the 25th year of the Republic of China), silk merchants will be the target of control, and the foreign trade of raw silk will be controlled first. First step: Send specialists to various foreign silk weaving industrial areas to conduct inspections. Establish foreign silk market intelligence agencies. Subsidize the export of high-quality raw silk. Establish foreign propaganda agencies. Second step: Encourage direct foreign trade of raw silk. Establish public raw silk warehouses. Implement raw silk quality inspection. Implement low-interest silk mortgage loans. Eliminate the export of inferior silk. Third step: Establish raw silk trading agencies in suitable silk sales locations. Conclude special agreements with foreign silk weaving companies to promote Guangdong silk. Public operation of raw silk foreign trade. In the second year (the 26th year of the Republic of China), silk factories will be the target of control, and silk reeling will be controlled. First step: Register silk factories. Train silk production backbone personnel. Improve the method of cocoon purchase at cocoon houses. Hold silk quality appraisal meetings. Reward high-quality raw silk. Second step: Promulgate standards and restrictions for the establishment of new silk factories. Subsidize excellent silk factories. Promulgate export raw silk quality inspection. Inspect silk factory equipment. Test silk production technicians. Organize joint silk factories. Third step: Crack down on substandard silk factories. Adjust raw silk production. Standardize raw silk quality. Unify the management of silk factories throughout the province. In the third year (the 27th year of the Republic of China), silkworm farmers and seed producers will be the target, and silkworm seed will be controlled. First step: Hold silkworm cocoon appraisal meetings. Hold silkworm seed quality registration. Reward excellent silkworm seed manufacturers. Determine the excellent standard silkworm seed throughout the province. Train silkworm disease inspection personnel. Train seed production technical backbone personnel. Second step: Organize examinations for sound seed producers and special personnel. Inspect seed production farm equipment. Organize seed producer registration. Promulgate the provincial seed production law. Third step: Crack down on substandard silkworm seed. The government will issue original silkworm seed uniformly. Unify the silkworm seed water period. Unify the silkworm seed value. Unify the management of silkworm seed production throughout the province. (June 16)</p>
<h3>Tranquility on the Border of Jiangxi and Guangdong</h3>
<p>However, the fractional silver currency in southern Jiangxi plummeted.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The area south of Ganzhou, including Nankang, Dayu, Chongyi, Shangyou, Xinfeng, Xunwu, Huichang, and the area of the three southern counties, is close to northern Guangdong. Since the suppression of the Red Army began, it has been defended by the Guangdong Army. During the time of Zhu De and Mao Zedong, Yu Hanmou served as the Commander of the Ganzhou Pacification, integrating politics and military affairs. Since the suppression, with the rise of the Guangdong pillar army, the outside world has been concerned about the situation in southern Jiangxi on the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong. It is now known that Yu Hanmou's First Army only has a small number of troops in the Ganzhou, Xinfeng, and Dayu area, and it is still peaceful. There is nothing unusual at the junction of Dayu and Xinfeng with Nanxiong. The Ganzhou-Shaozhou bus on the Jiangxi-Guangdong Road is still running as usual. However, the economy of southern Jiangxi has a considerable relationship with Guangdong. Since the price of fractional silver currency in Guangdong has fallen, the price of fractional silver currency circulating in Ganzhou has also plummeted. In addition, copper coins are extremely scarce, making it difficult to make change. The lower and middle classes feel uneasy about their lives.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Arresting an Opium Trafficker and Escorting Him to the County</h3>
<p>On the 18th, the Huan'an Defense Corps seized Wang Changling, who lives in Huanjiuguan in the southern city of the town. He was carrying a rattan basket, coming from Zhujing, and looked flustered. They stepped forward to inquire, but he stuttered. They made him check, and found one hundred liang of Yuanda Special Sichuan opium and twenty liang of Yuchangling opium in the basket. They then escorted him to the Yilin Public Security First Sub-bureau for preliminary interrogation. According to him, the rattan basket belonged to Xia Leqin (also known as Xia Yansong). They met on the Songyu Beach and paid him one yuan, instructing him to bring it south. He is now going to Pinghu and will take a long-distance bus to Jinshanwei Station on the next day, and so on. The bureau immediately sent people to the station to wait, and indeed captured Xia. Two hundred and fourteen yuan in paper money, five yuan in silver, five yuan in corner tickets, forty double haos, and a Shanghai tobacco license were found on him. He directly admitted the above situation, but said that the opium was only five liang of Zheng Qiaji brand, and the paper money was collected from Zhejiang. When questioned about Wang Changling, he said that Xia always trafficked opium and transported it to the Zhejiang area. After obtaining the confession, the bureau escorted them both to the county bureau on the 20th for handling by the county government.</p>
<h3>Taicang: Committing Suicide in Fear of Murder</h3>
<p>Xu Xiaodi, a woman from Faifeng, is 20 years old this year. She is usually romantic and has known Zhang Bingkui, a vagrant from the same town, for many years. They vowed to grow old together. But Xu recently found a new lover, which Zhang found out about, and he couldn't help but be consumed by jealousy. At about 1 p.m. on the 19th of this month, Xu Xiaodi and her family planned to take a bus on the Xihu Road to the city to watch the dragon boat race. About 100 meters away from the Shuangfeng Station near Mojia Bridge, Zhang Bingkui suddenly hacked her with an axe, causing four cuts on the top of her head, and blood flowed like a fountain. She immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, Zhang took a concealed sharp knife and slashed his neck, fainting. Xu's family, seeing the catastrophe, returned to Shuangyi to report the incident to the Public Security Sub-station and hired a boat to transport the two injured people to the city to report to the county. The county government sent them to the county hospital and the Sian Clinic for treatment. However, the injuries were very serious, and there was fear for their lives.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Clearing Tongyi Debts</h3>
<p>After the Suzhou Tongyi Trust Company announced its closure on the 16th, the creditors hired a lawyer to organize a creditor group to carry out legal procedures and oppose liquidation. After the company's manager, Mi Xunwu, disappeared on the day of the announcement of the closure, there has been no news of him. The liquidators of the Shanghai Head Office, accountant Xi Wangshu and lawyer Li Zuyu, specially entrusted Suzhou accountants Zhu Xinmin and lawyers Zhu Fucheng and Zhu Chengxuan to handle the registration matters of the creditors of the Suzhou Branch. Starting from the 20th, a registration office was set up at No. 10 Jiancang Lane to start registration. Accountants Zhu Xinmin and others also contacted lawyers Zhang Yu and Qian Zonghua, who were hired by the creditors, on the 20th to handle the registration matters so that they could start the liquidation.</p>
<p>A Bloody Case Occurs in Brothel</p>
<p>At about 2 a.m. yesterday (20th), Cao Zhongxia, who lives at No. 11 Taipingfang outside Jinmen, was visiting a brothel with several friends. After going out, an argument broke out over one yuan for the sedan chair fare. He was hacked four times with an axe by a man named A Wu. Seeing that his purpose had been achieved, the murderer fled. Cao was seriously injured and blood flowed all over the ground. He was hired by passers-by to be sent to Guangmin Hospital for treatment. The injuries were quite serious, and he lost too much blood, so his life was in great danger.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Emergency Meeting of Reporters</h3>
<p>Recently, Lian Yuehun, a reporter from Wuxi News, and Ma Jichu, Zhu Changshou, and others contracted to sell Liujiang coal, and the Shanghainese company engaged in reciprocal entertainment, and the comments were agitated, pointing to it as attracting wolves into the house, which had something to do with the reputation of the association. An emergency meeting was held yesterday afternoon, attended by 31 members, who unanimously resolved: Expel Lian Yuehun from the association forever. Send a letter to the Xibao Museum to dismiss Lian Yuehun. Send letters to various colleagues that Lian Yuehun must never be employed. Each newspaper simultaneously published an advertisement for the association's expulsion of Lian Yuehun, and Xibao also published an advertisement for the dismissal of Lian Yuehun at the same time. Regarding the issue of smuggling, the situation is becoming increasingly serious. It was also resolved that the News Reporters Association would immediately organize a committee to assist in smuggling, with eleven members, and would immediately convene a meeting, on the one hand, to promote enthusiastic publicity in various newspapers, and on the other hand, to monitor closely.</p>
<p>Town Mayor Sued for Illegal Activities</p>
<p>Zhu Qisheng and other citizens of the 9th district of the county presented evidence to the Provincial Anti-Opium Association accusing Ma Jichu, the town mayor of Nanbianmiao Tie, of privately smoking opium, sheltering district residents Zhang Daru, Feng Wangou, and Yang Bingquan from privately smoking, and instigating Feng Rende and Xu Ziqing in February of last year to plant drugs on the townspeople in order to frame Zhang Guangxuan and others. After receiving the presentation, the Provincial Association immediately ordered the Wuxi County Government to secretly order the Public Security Bureau to send police officers to the countryside to arrest the above persons. However, after arriving in the countryside, only Zhang Daru was captured. The rest had fled upon hearing the news. After the criminal Zhang was taken to the county, he confessed to smoking opium, but the license he held did not match the name and appearance. He was sent to the drug rehabilitation center for compulsory detoxification and detained pending verification after the other criminals were captured.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Three Murder Cases Occurred</h3>
<p>Recently, many murder cases have occurred in this area. The most bizarre is the case of conspiring to murder one's husband and then killing one's children. After the county government examined the bodies, there may be shocking developments in the coming days. Now, we record three more murder cases as follows: The workers constructing the Yangfu Road have now completed the road, but the workers have not all dispersed and are still lingering in the countryside, causing trouble. A group of them in Gang Kou demanded money from the Baozhang (village head) the other day, resulting in a conflict with the villagers. The road workers were outnumbered and fled. However, one person, Hu Zailiang, was missing. On the evening of the 19th, his body was found floating in the river. The household has reported to the county for an examination. Baozhang Ma Dasheng is suspected of instigating the beating and has been arrested. Yao Zhang, an old widow residing outside the South Gate, is 95 years old. Recently, she had a dispute with her daughter-in-law, Chen Cuijuan, and Chen's sister, etc., over cattle feed and was beaten. As a result, the woman committed suicide out of depression. After the county examined the body, there were slight injuries. The two daughters have also been detained. Tang Hai, a resident of Wuqiu Township in the Eighth District, cohabited with a mistress. Unexpectedly, the woman suddenly died violently the other day. According to Tang, she committed suicide. Neighbors reported that a beating had occurred that night, or that she was beaten to death, resulting in injuries all over her body. After reporting to the county, an examination has been conducted in the village.</p>
<h3>Jingjiang: Robbery Occurred Outside the East Gate</h3>
<p>Liu Rongqiu, who lives outside the East Gate, is a wealthy man. At 11 o'clock last night, a group of robbers dressed in military uniforms and with their faces painted black broke into his house. They seized Liu, threatened him with guns, and forced him to hand over silver dollars. As a result, they robbed him of more than 300 yuan in national currency, a pistol, a gold Elgin watch from the United States, a gold chain, and many pieces of gold and silver jewelry and silk clothing, with a total loss of about 600 yuan. The case has been reported to the county for assistance in the arrest.</p>
<h3>The Entire Yangjing Road is Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>Since the Yangjing Highway was completed, the Lin Highway Administration has been actively preparing for its opening to traffic. In addition to the section from Fengxing to Kou'an, which has already been officially opened to traffic, the sections from Taixing to Jingbawei Port and from Kou'an to Yangzhou are currently setting up stations and are scheduled to be fully open to traffic in early July.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Apprentice Electrocuted to Death</h3>
<p>Wan Jinlin, a 17-year-old apprentice from Pudong, Shanghai, at the Xinghua Electroplating Factory on Cheng Meng Gengzi Street, got up to urinate at about 4 a.m. on the 19th. He suddenly cried out in panic, claiming to have seen a black ghost in the room. It is thought that he was frightened by a dream. Immediately afterward, he touched the machine's electricity, fainted, and fell to the ground. By the time the other apprentices woke up and tried to rescue him, he had already died. The court prosecutor's office sent an examiner, Zhang Han, to investigate. The result was that he died by electrocution. Because the apprentice had no family members, the factory has been officially ordered to provide a coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Establishment of a Sanitary Experimental Zone</h3>
<p>Ge Tan, the commissioner of Nantong District, has obtained approval from the provincial government to designate Tongcheng Township, Tangzha, Langshan, Yaogang, Jiangjiaqiao, and Tianshenggang as sanitary experimental zones. Yan Xifeng has been appointed as the chief to be responsible for handling sanitary administrative facilities.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Sites of Five Major Agricultural Warehouses Determined</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department is actively preparing to establish agricultural warehouses. It dispatched expert Xu Yuanruo to Jin Hua, Ningbo, Yongjia, Linhai, and other counties in eastern Zhejiang to investigate agricultural production and suitable locations for warehouses. He has now returned to the province. It is understood that five large-scale agricultural warehouses will be established in Pingyang, Yueqing, Jinhua, Haining, and Linhai. Seventy-five medium-sized warehouses will be established in Ningbo, Shaoxing, Yuyao, and other counties. The cost is 3 million yuan, which is currently being negotiated with the China Farmers Bank. Mr. Xu has reported everything to Wu Ting.</p>
<h3>Traffic on the Hangfu Road Resumes</h3>
<p>The Hangfu Highway was temporarily suspended due to flash floods along the route the other day. The road surface in the Fuyang to Gaoqiao section was several feet underwater. Traffic on the Hangfu Road was obstructed. Now that the floodwaters have gradually receded, bus services have resumed as normal from yesterday (the 20th).</p>
<h3>Relief for Tongyi Depositors</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Since the Tongyi Trust Company announced its closure, depositors in Hangzhou have been in a state of panic and have been making representations one after another. The Hangzhou manager of the company, Jiang Gengsheng, has now entrusted lawyer Zhang Tao to handle the liquidation. According to Jiang, the Shanghai head office still owes the Hangzhou branch a huge sum of more than 400,000 yuan. If this amount is recovered, the Hangzhou branch will not be in debt. However, according to the estimates of the Hangzhou depositors, the amount owed to the depositors is still more than 500,000 yuan, leaving a shortfall of more than 10,000 yuan after offsetting the two amounts. Yesterday morning (the 20th), the Hangzhou municipal government convened a meeting of both parties and representatives from banks, chambers of commerce, and other merchants to resolve the issue. It was decided to send the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association to thoroughly investigate the matter before proceeding with the handling, with the principle of ensuring that depositors do not suffer losses.</p>
<h3>Jiashan: Farmers Resist Bandits and Suffer Injuries</h3>
<p>Chen Xiaoti's house, a farmer near Datong Bridge in Tianning Town, was visited by more than ten bandits on the night of the 18th. They knocked on the door and entered, each holding a pistol and an electric torch, and searched the house. The victim, Chen Xiaoti, resisted upon hearing the noise and was shot in the lower abdomen by the bandits, with blood flowing like a river. He immediately fainted to the ground. The bandits took the opportunity to loot. When the neighbors gathered to apprehend them, the bandits were cornered and fired wildly, causing Chen Xiaoti's younger brother and neighbors Gan Ayou and Mo Daguan to also be injured and fall to the ground. The bandits then calmly fled.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Another Theft Case Occurs in the County and City</h3>
<p>On the night of the 17th, the house of Yang Youfu, a large depositor and neighbor of the county and city, was robbed. The robbery lasted for half an hour, and the stolen clothes and jewelry were estimated to be worth between 400 and 500 yuan. Merchants and residents throughout the city were greatly alarmed by the successive theft cases in the vicinity of the county and city. Yesterday afternoon (the 18th), dozens of representatives went to the Chamber of Commerce to petition and request measures to be taken to ensure safety and stabilize the situation.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Implementation Plan of National Economic Construction</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ping</p>
<p>I. Introduction</p>
<p>The year after the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan in Soviet Russia, I was studying in England, researching land policies of various countries with Professor Maisky Dov of the University of London. Mr. Mai was a descendant of the Imperial Russia, former professor of land law at the University of St. Petersburg, and vice-speaker of the Imperial Russian Duma. Therefore, he was very familiar with the economic situation in Russia. In addition to discussing land policies, we occasionally talked about the implementation of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan. At that time, the Five-Year Plan had not been implemented for long, and many scholars in various countries regarded it as a fantasy and ridiculed it, and few paid attention to it. However, I saw that the plan itself was detailed and meticulous, and it was by no means a mere empty talk on paper. Moreover, the communist system and methods were the only way for countries with backward production to develop economic construction. If a country with backward production does not take the entire country as a unit and promote economic construction in an organized and planned manner, then its economic development will never catch up with that of industrialized countries. Therefore, I paid special attention to the evolution of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, and painstakingly collected all kinds of public and private records, as well as criticisms from various parties, as reference materials.</p>
<p>That winter, I was invited by the Chinese students in London to give a public lecture at the London branch of our party. The topic was "The Soviet Union's Five-Year Industrial Construction Plan." In addition to systematically describing what I had learned from my research, I also spoke highly of the planned economic system itself. At that time, this caused criticism from some comrades, because at that time, people generally had a shallow understanding of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan itself, and often equated the Five-Year Plan with communism, so they could not help but turn pale at the mention of it.</p>
<p>Later, I went from England to Germany. I learned that German scholars were more interested in planned economics than those in England. The records and commentaries on the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan were also richer than those in England, which made it easier to collect reference materials.</p>
<p>After returning to China, witnessing the current situation of our country, I became more convinced that the implementation of a planned economy is the only way for our country's economic development. Last spring, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the National Economic Construction Movement, which was actually a bright path indicating the direction for our country's economic construction. My belief in planned economics became even stronger. In mid-May of this year, I was ordered to attend the High-Level Local Administrative Conference of the Executive Yuan. On the issue of national economic construction, I strongly advocated that the central government should formulate specific measures and order all localities to implement them conscientiously. Later, I was summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. In addition to reporting on my work, I also gave a detailed account of my personal views on national economic construction. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek appreciated my views very much. Now that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is vigorously promoting the National Economic Construction Movement, I do not hesitate to present this manuscript in the hope of seeking corrections from experts in various fields.</p>
<p>II. The Path of National Economic Construction: Controlled Economy? Or Planned Economy?</p>
<p>What path should our country take to implement national economic construction today? This is actually the first issue that needs to be resolved at present. Recently, the idea of a controlled economy has been gaining momentum. Does this mean that a controlled economy is the path for our country's national economic construction? I believe that our country's national economic construction should not adopt the path of a controlled economy, but should adopt the path of a planned economy. Although planned economy and controlled economy are similar in form, they are fundamentally different in essence. I will explain this as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Distinction Between Planned Economy and Controlled Economy. Planned economy is a positive economic policy, a new and rational economic form. To implement a planned economy, the entire national economy, such as production, exchange, distribution, and consumption, must be made into a precise and interconnected plan. This plan is centrally controlled by the government, so that national economic activities become an organic entity. In a country that implements a planned economy, the direction of its national economy takes the plan as its body and control as its use, and uses the means of control to achieve the purpose of the plan. As for a controlled economy, it is a negative economic policy, a remedy produced by countries where capitalism has developed to its final stage in order to resolve their inevitable economic contradictions and maintain their original economic system. Therefore, it is fundamentally different from a planned economy in essence.</p>
<p>2. What Our Country Needs is a Planned Economy. China's economic development has not yet reached the level of modern capitalist countries. At the same time, the economic forces of imperialism envelop our country's entire national economy, causing us to groan under the shackles of foreign capitalism and unable to free ourselves. Therefore, we do not need to be concerned about our original economic system, nor do we need to maintain or remedy it. Therefore, in order to break through the shackles of the old system and find a way out for ourselves, we do not need a patching-up controlled economy to maintain the old economic system. Instead, we need to actively and creatively establish a planned economic system based on the Three Principles of the People according to the needs of the national environment. Moreover, the economic policy of the Principle of People's Livelihood aims to develop the national economy from the standpoint of economic equality for the entire nation. The implementation of a planned economic system based on the Three Principles of the People has centralized control over economic construction on the one hand, promoting it in a planned manner, so that production can be developed reasonably and rapidly. On the other hand, the results of production will not be dominated and monopolized by a few people, and fair enjoyment can be obtained in distribution. Therefore, if we want to develop our country's national economy, there is no other way but to implement a planned economy.</p>
<p>3. Steps for Planning National Economic Construction</p>
<p>The first step in planning national economic construction is to appropriately organize the original economic organizations and production units - all individuals engaged in economic activities are regarded as production units, such as factories, workshops, stores, farms, and financial, transportation, and communication institutions - so that the same production units are closely combined to form an organic whole. It is necessary to have this basic organization first, so that the investigation and statistics of all economic situations and production conditions have a reliable source, the setting of economic plans has a definite basis, and the promotion of the entire plan can be as flexible as the body using the arm and the arm using the finger.</p>
<p>After the production units are organized, the central planning agency reports to the central planning agency based on the specific reports of each production unit (each production unit should submit a detailed report on its production status and economic situation to the central planning agency, such as each factory should report in detail on its capital amount, number of workers, type and number of machines, annual output, sales area, and profit and loss situation). According to the principles of national economic construction, a preliminary outline of national economic construction is made and sent to various localities and production units level by level, ordering them to follow the outline principles and, based on their actual situations, make production plans for each locality and production unit and submit them to the central government. The central government then comprehensively sorts out and arranges these production plans, considers the urgency and importance, adjusts their mutual relations, determines their system and procedures, and makes an entire national economic construction plan, which is then issued level by level to various localities and production units, each of which is responsible for carrying out its own tasks as stipulated in the plan. In this way, progressing step by step and counting the results according to the process, the realization of the national economic construction plan can be guaranteed.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Groundbreaking Ceremony at the Qiujiang Wharf: Over 1,500 Chinese and Foreign Guests Attended; Minister Kong Personally Conducted the Groundbreaking Ceremony and Delivered an Address; the Entire Project is Scheduled for Completion by the End of This Year</p>
<p>The Qiujiang Wharf, an investment project of the Central Bank, held a grand groundbreaking ceremony at 3:00 PM yesterday with the laying of the cornerstone. Over 1,500 guests from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, attended. Minister Kong personally conducted the groundbreaking ceremony. The entire project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, marking a significant event. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrangement of the Venue</p>
<p>The venue was located inside the Qiujiang Wharf office, on the wharf at the bottom of Dinghai Island. An archway was erected, with a white cloth and yellow lettering stating "Welcome to the Qiujiang Wharf Groundbreaking Ceremony." The Mirror Radiance, Mirror Clarity, Flying Wave, and Li Fei steamboats were prepared to welcome the guests. The ferry from Dinghai Island to the Qiujiang Wharf took only seven minutes. A tall archway made of pine and cypress was erected on the wharf, with the national flag and the banner "Welcome to the Qiujiang Wharf Groundbreaking Ceremony" hanging above. The cornerstone was placed at the door of the wharf office, covered with the national flag and surrounded by flowers. A signing area was set up at the entrance, where guests signed their names and received a commemorative booklet and a specially made fan from the Central Savings Society. Inside was the auditorium, with the national flag, a portrait of Sun Yat-sen, and flower baskets donated by Zhou Zuomin and others hanging in the center of the stage. The auditorium was decorated with red and yellow silk fabrics and small national flags. Seats were arranged throughout the hall for guests to enjoy tea and refreshments. The arrangement was solemn and orderly. Tan Guang, Zhu Shiyi, Zhang Xisan, and other senior officials from the Central Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Qiujiang Wharf Office warmly received the guests. Police officers and security guards from the Public Security Bureau and the City Security Corps were stationed around the wharf to maintain strict security.</p>
<p>(Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Attendance List</p>
<p>Yesterday, attendees from various circles, both Chinese and foreign, included: on the Chinese side, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Vice Minister Xu Kan, Mayor of Shanghai Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee Song Ziliang, Committee Members Chen Xing, Ye Zhuotang, Liu Hongsheng, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, as well as Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Cai Jingjun, Li Tingan, Cai Zengji, Rong Zongjing, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zheng Lai, Tang Haian, Fu Rulin, Wu Liande, Yu Hongjun; on the foreign side, Chief of Customs Mellon, Customs Commissioner Baronsan, and consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai, including the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, and Poland, such as Bilinan, Kribai, Gosse, Baudazzi, as well as managers and directors from shipping companies such as Dalei, Changxing, British, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Italian. In total, there were over 1,500 guests, both men and women, from various Chinese and foreign organizations. Song Ziliang presided over the ceremony, Kong Xiangmian served as the master of ceremonies, and the Public Security Bureau sent a military band to play music.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Chairman Song Ziliang delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Today, we are holding the groundbreaking ceremony for the Qiujiang Wharf. It is an honor to have Minister Kong, Mayor Wu, and representatives from various circles present to guide us. In order to develop international trade, revive the national economy, and promote the prosperity of Shanghai, the government specially commissioned the Central Bank to finance the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf. In September of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Mr. Zhang Gongquan, Mr. Chen Jianan, Mr. Xu Keting, Mr. Ye Zhuotang, Mr. Charles, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, and myself were ordered to form the Qiujiang Wharf Design Committee. In August of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), after the design work was completed, we were ordered to reorganize into the Construction Committee to undertake the construction of the wharf. Over the past two years, with Minister Kong's constant guidance and supervision, and with the full assistance of all committee members, the construction has taken shape and the foundation has been laid. I am deeply grateful. Today's groundbreaking ceremony, on the surface, may seem plain and unremarkable, but its significance is profound. As the saying goes, 'A tall island is based on grains of sand, a vast ocean is based on drops of water.' Everything must have a foundation before it can be developed. Today, the first phase of the Qiujiang Wharf construction project is only laying the foundation. It may not be like a tall island with grains of sand or a vast ocean with drops of water, but the second and third phases of the project will be carried out step by step and realized one by one. Once completed, the Qiujiang Wharf will be as great and advanced as the world's most complete and excellent wharves. It is also closely related to the concerted efforts of the Chinese government and people in economic construction. Let me briefly elaborate. In the 11th year of the Republic (1922), the League of Nations sent a team of six world-renowned harbor engineers to China to study the Shanghai wharf problem. Among these six engineers, one was the chief engineer of the Port of London in the United Kingdom, one was the chairman of the National Harbor Management Committee in the United States, one was the former chief engineer of the Suez Canal, and one was the former chief engineer of the Dutch East Indies harbor. All of them were harbor experts. According to the detailed research results of the investigation team, the location of the Qiujiang Wharf was considered the most ideal wharf area. This area can directly connect to the Songhu Railway and conduct joint transportation with major domestic trunk lines. Goods arriving in Shanghai from overseas can be unloaded directly onto trains and distributed to the interior, while goods exported from the interior can be loaded onto trains at the Qiujiang Wharf and shipped directly overseas, saving time and transportation costs. This not only promotes international trade but also enhances international friendship. The wharf has ample open space nearby, which is planned to be used to build an airport and designate a place on the river for seaplanes to dock, so that passengers can travel easily. In this way, we can achieve not only water and land joint transportation, but also water, land, and air joint transportation. This kind of facility will greatly help the development of the national economy. Our country is now working hard to promote various construction projects in order to enable domestic industry and commerce to develop rapidly. The current construction plan of the Qiujiang Wharf is also aimed at this goal, so as to make transportation convenient, trade prosperous, and fully expand the strength of the national economy. When Wuquan Road is completed in the future, the transportation between the wharf and the city center will be even more convenient. This wharf project will have a profound impact on the prosperity of the city. Everything from transportation, finance, industry, and commerce can rely on it to flourish, and the prosperity of the city center can be guaranteed. Therefore, after the completion of the entire Qiujiang Wharf construction plan, it will not only be the most complete wharf in our country but also lead all the wharves in the Far East. On the occasion of laying the foundation, we specially held a ceremony, inviting Minister Kong to preside over it and inviting leaders from all walks of life to participate, hoping that everyone will express their high opinions and give guidance. I am very fortunate."</p>
<p>Minister's Address</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi delivered an address, saying, "Chairman, Mayor Wu, distinguished guests, today is the day of the groundbreaking ceremony for the Qiujiang Wharf. Just now, Mr. Song Ziliang has already talked about the significance of holding the groundbreaking ceremony for the Qiujiang Wharf. What I want to talk about now is the motivation and significance of building the Qiujiang Wharf. Shanghai has been a commercial port for decades. The reason why it can be transformed from a scattered fishing village into a bustling metropolis is because of its excellent port conditions. However, with the continuous development of Shanghai's industry and commerce, the existing wharves are obviously insufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf is necessary. This wharf will not only improve Shanghai's port capacity but also promote the development of international trade. After the Qiujiang Wharf is completed, it will become one of the largest and most modern wharves in the Far East, providing excellent services for domestic and foreign merchants. In the past two years, the construction committee members have spent a lot of time and energy on the design and construction of the wharf, detailed planning, and the Shanghai Municipal Government has also made great efforts to help, so that the wharf has achieved today's achievements. This should be to Mayor Wu and the high authorities, as well as the Construction Committee, Mr. Song Ziliang and all the committee members expressed thanks, after the wharf can be as we hope, to develop our country's domestic and foreign trade, to promote the prosperity of the city center, and to assist the state-owned enterprises, I hope all sectors help, so that the Qiujiang Wharf to complete his mission, and finally, one more word, that is, the construction of the Qiujiang Wharf, although focused on the commercial nature, but the construction of this unique Far East wharf, is the National Government, because the Central Bank is gradually a state bank, is the National Government set up, so we built the wharf of the motive, not for profit, his purpose is to serve the head of the staff, to understand the wharf construction of the significance of the meaning, to invigorate the spirit of service, so that the community in general and we cooperate, Shanghai is a mixed Chinese and foreign places, I hope especially the city people, the public in the spirit of service, to engage in cooperation, not only make international trade, can be developed, and thus make the feelings of the country and the country, the feelings of the people and the people, can be a day of progress, this is what I hope today, and finally on behalf of the Central Trust Bureau, thank you today all the guests of the Huiyun and so on."</p>

<p>Mayor's Address</p>
<p>Mayor Wu addressed the audience, saying, "It is a great honor to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony of the Qiujiang Wharf today. Before speaking, I would like to express my congratulations to Minister Kong and all the committee members. The construction of this wharf is the beginning of a new era for Shanghai. Not only the people of the city have unlimited hopes for this construction, but also people from all countries should have infinite expectations. Shanghai is the fifth largest commercial port in the world and the only port in our country. It has been open for business for more than ninety years, but the facilities of the wharf are far behind other seaports in the world, and even inferior to Qingdao and Dalian ports in the country. Therefore, to prosper Shanghai, the existing wharf facilities must be improved. Therefore, Minister Kong suggested to the government after returning from his inspection of Europe and the United States years ago that the development of international trade requires the construction of a new wharf. In the short period of two years, the ideal has become a reality. In the near future, there will be a modern wharf comparable to seaports in various countries, which is gratifying to us. Foreign countries have a great commercial and financial relationship with Shanghai, and people from all countries should be happy to hear about the establishment of this modern wharf, and the people of the country should be even more happy, because Shanghai is the largest city in our country, and this new facility is enough to show the government's intention to serve the people of Shanghai and people from all countries in Shanghai. Finally, I would like to add three points to the wharf facilities: (1) When the wharf is completed, the world's largest cruise ships can berth here, saving one hour of time; (2) Goods can be directly loaded and unloaded onto trains or ships here, avoiding the trouble of transporting them to the warehouse; (3) When Wuquan Road is completed, passengers can reach the municipal government in seven minutes and the Huamao Hotel in seventeen minutes."</p>
<p>Guest Speech</p>
<p>Following this, Zhou Zuomin, the General Manager of Jin Cheng Bank, gave a speech, briefly saying, "The importance of the construction of the Jiang Wharf to the prosperity of Shanghai has been explained in detail by the chairman, Minister Kong, and Mayor Wu, so there is no need to repeat it. However, our expectation for the success of this wharf is not only limited to local development, but also to develop international trade through this wharf. It depends on the economic situation and development level of Shanghai, which is unlimited. Therefore, it is expected that the day the wharf is completed will be the beginning of the expansion of international trade." Furthermore, yesterday's speech by the chairman and other guests were given in both Chinese and English. Except for the chairman, Song Ziliang, who gave his speech in both Chinese and English, the speeches of Minister Kong and others were translated by Chen Liting, a specialist from the Economic Research Department of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Situation</p>
<p>The groundbreaking ceremony was held at 4:20 PM. The cornerstone was located on the right side of the main entrance of the wharf office building. The cornerstone was made of white mica, with the words "Groundbreaking by Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance, President of the Central Bank, and Chairman of the Central Trust Bureau. Song Ziliang, Chairman of the Qiujiang Wharf Construction Committee, and Committee Members Zhang Jia’ao, Chen Xing, Xu Kan, Ye Zhuotang, Charles, and Liu Hongsheng, June 20th, 25th Year of the Republic of China" engraved in gold. During the groundbreaking ceremony, the managing personnel first removed the national flag covering the cornerstone. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, then personally held a steel shovel and applied cement to the four sides of the cornerstone for twenty minutes. Amidst the melodious music, the surging river, the thunderous applause, and the cheers of the guests, the foundation of the Qiujiang Wharf, which is purely managed by the Chinese people in the Far East, was laid for eternity. Photos were taken to commemorate the event. Then, Chinese and foreign guests shook hands with Minister Kong and the members of the Construction Committee to express their congratulations, and after enjoying tea and refreshments, they took four small ferries across the river and disembarked at Dinghai Island to return.</p>
<p>Project Overview</p>
<p>The Qiujiang Wharf construction project is divided into three phases. The first phase of construction includes two wharves, two steel-concrete warehouses, two iron-shed flat warehouses, offices, staff residences, and residences for wharf supervisors and inspectors. A reporter from the New News Agency took advantage of the ceremony yesterday to visit the site and saw that the foundation of the wharf had taken shape, the steel-concrete deck was under construction, the wharf office had been built to one floor, and other projects such as warehouses had begun. Wuquan Road, the only way to the wharf, has been completed by 70-80% and will be completed in the shortest possible time. The wharf is surrounded by piles of coarse and fine steel, wood, cement and other materials, which shows the active progress of the construction project. The first phase of the wharf was originally scheduled to be completed between September and October, but due to a strike at the American Wood Bridge Company, several hundred pieces of wood could not be transported, which slightly affected the progress of the project and will be delayed until the end of this year.</p>

<p>Opening Address</p>
<p>Chairman Yu Zuoting delivered the following opening address: Since the establishment of this Chamber in July of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], in accordance with the Chamber’s charter, a general membership meeting has been held once every year in June. This session is the seventh general membership meeting. All information regarding the Chamber’s affairs and financial status over the past year has been separately reported, so there is no need to elaborate further. I would like to take this opportunity to speak to the members of this Chamber. Since the government implemented the legal tender policy on November 4th of last year, although the market has been slightly more active, the decline in commerce has not been remedied. Moreover, due to the volatile situation in North China, the area for domestic product sales has actually shrunk. Recently, smuggling has been rampant, spreading even further, and even the Yangtze River basin is in danger of being affected. Therefore, the situation can be described as commerce still being in the worst possible state. Merchants who wish to survive must make even greater efforts. Considering the difficult environment that merchants have faced over the past year, such as the shrinkage of the northern market, they have sought to expand sales in the Pearl River basin and the islands of Southeast Asia. Business firms and factories in this city have organized two inspection groups and participated in the Singapore National Products Exhibition. Now, the China National Industries Foreign Trade Association has been established, planning to carry various samples to various places in Southeast Asia for mobile exhibitions. Beforehand, this Chamber sent letters to various overseas Chinese Chambers of Commerce to make preliminary contacts and inquire about local tax regulations and whether there are import quotas, in order to make preparations. All of this is clear evidence of the struggle of merchants in this city to survive. Unfortunately, the marketing of goods is greatly affected by tax regulations. However, Guangdong and Guangxi have established several special taxes for the import of domestic products, and repeated requests for exemption have been unsuccessful. Furthermore, there are already several export taxes that must be paid when domestic products are sold abroad. Last June, the Ministry of Finance had clearly planned to exempt these taxes, but due to diplomatic obstacles, this has not been realized through a compensatory method, which creates many obstacles for the export of domestic products to Southeast Asia. This is something that our merchants should continue to work on. Secondly, the decline of industry and commerce in recent years, in addition to the decline in people's purchasing power, the shrinking of the market, and the stagnation of finance, is also due to the lack of planning and overproduction within the same industry. For example, the rubber products industry failed for this reason. The reason why the match industry has been able to stand its ground recently is due to the great national union of the same industry, each adjusting its production and sales. The recent national coal mining industry conference is also planning to start from this point. Therefore, the revival of industry and commerce and the control of industry and commerce cannot be separated into two separate things. In view of this, this Chamber drafted a draft of the Industrial Control Regulations and submitted it to the industry authorities for adoption and implementation. For the sake of prudence, the industry authorities have collected opinions from various provinces and cities and will then formulate a concrete plan after compiling them. However, the difficulty of this matter lies in the fact that provinces that have already achieved control with the power of one province are quite unwilling to have national industrial control facilities. Therefore, it is difficult to get the opinions of all provinces to be consistent and compiled. If it is not possible, then there is another method, that is, the same industry can control itself and unite itself, such as the above-mentioned match industry, which is the best example. To do this, it is necessary to increase the power of trade associations and strictly organize merchant groups in order to promote and benefit. The proposal to improve the organization of merchants submitted by the Executive Committee at this meeting is designed to achieve this plan. When Zuoting took office in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], he made it a priority during his term to conduct commercial education and cultivate sound commercial talents. Therefore, in addition to enriching the facilities of the commercial evening school and receiving the Nanyang Senior Commercial School, which was renamed the Chamber's private commercial vocational school, and carefully selecting teachers and teaching materials, from the 25th year [1936] onwards, it is planned to set up a labor class in the commercial evening school. I dare not to be negligent just because my term is about to expire, because the quality of labor technology has a great impact on industrial production. The reason why Chinese textile factories are not as good as foreign textile factories is because of this. In recent years, Chinese people have gradually realized this, so the production capacity of workers in Chinese textile factories and workers in foreign factories has gradually become closer, not as large as the previous gap. However, in terms of the overall industry, it is necessary to make greater efforts. Therefore, although the Chamber's financial situation is very difficult, it has to try its best to achieve success. For the past two years, I have felt that my talent is too short to cope with the difficult environment of the Chamber and to make long-term plans. I am afraid that I have failed the trust of the members. Now, at the beginning of this meeting, it is also the end of the two-year term, so I would like to express my sincere feelings here, and I hope you will understand.</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan's Speech</p>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a training speech, saying, "Today is the seventh general meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and I am very honored to be ordered to attend and participate. Today, we are in a period of serious national crisis, and the government is extremely hopeful that representatives from the business community will assist in jointly responding to the difficult situation. However, if we want to resolve all the current difficulties, we rely entirely on the power of unity. Before the establishment of the National Government, merchants all held the purpose of engaging in commerce, regardless of politics. However, after several years of experience, they deeply understand the importance of the relationship between commerce and politics. Because the number code is a political animal, it is okay if the merchant's profession has nothing to do with politics, but it is almost impossible not to be affected by politics. Commerce is not only affected by domestic politics, but also by international politics. The importance of the relationship between politics and commerce, as the government reformed the currency system last year, is as the chairman reported earlier. The business community was able to barely overcome the difficulties as a result of the government's implementation of the currency system policy, which proves that the actions of politics are closely related to the rise and fall of industry and commerce. You are leaders of the business community, and you should pay attention to the trends of national politics at any time, use the power of commerce to assist the government and promote all facilities. It is necessary for the whole country to be united and work together to seek the revival of national commerce. Recently, the Southwest Incident, the people of the whole country do not want another civil war to happen, and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups have a deep understanding of this, and first published public opinion, which is the fundamental force to save the country. Therefore, today's citizens should always implement this general understanding and help the government to complete the national unified situation. If anyone engages in non-centripetal and centrifugal work, they are traitors, trapped by enemies. Second, commerce must have a whole unity. The organization of the Chamber of Commerce and trade associations is not only for the internal affairs, but its purpose is how to defend against dumping and smuggling of foreign goods, and how to eliminate the economic aggression of the great powers. When I was the head of the Social Affairs Bureau, I insisted that stores should join the association, and the association should join the Chamber of Commerce. This is the trend of the world. Merchants cannot develop without a whole unity. Therefore, if you can gather the power of most stores and become the power of the association, then seeking the revival of commerce is like taking things out of a bag. All of this can be done by merchants themselves by properly setting the rules. For example, recently the smuggling problem, all industries have inspection of smuggled goods organizations, if you can do your best to implement, smuggled goods are not difficult to stop. I hope you will concentrate the power of all industries and combine it with the power of the government to deal with foreign aggression, then the country and the revival of industry and commerce will be a positive proportional progress.</p>
<p>Wu Huanru's Speech  Speech by Wu Huanru, Representative of the Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Saying, "Today is the seventh general meeting of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and I am honored to be ordered by the Social Affairs Bureau to participate in previous meetings. This is the sixth time, which is very honorable. Most of the representatives present are acquaintances, which makes me even happier. I would like to take this opportunity to offer two opinions to you. The first point is the recent smuggling problem that is closely related to the Chinese industry and commerce. In the past few years, a certain country has seized the corner of Northeast China, and its ambition has not been curbed. The evil forces have extended into the Great Wall, affecting the entire situation in North China. They rely on military power to seize the raw materials produced in our country and manufacture their industries, and at the same time, they have also solved their domestic unemployment problems. On the one hand, they use various methods to dump as much as possible in the Chinese market. We consume for them and send money to them, which is really heartbreaking. Recently, in addition to using military aggression, they have also instructed the so-called ronin to engage in smuggling to avoid our customs duties. Since the goods do not need to pay taxes, the cost is naturally low. This not only reduces the income of our national treasury and prevents us from engaging in the construction of various rights and interests, but the first to bear the brunt of the harm is our colleagues in the industrial and commercial circles. In recent years, our industrial and commercial circles have had considerable awareness and have made considerable progress in striving for self-sufficiency. Everyone has the same heart, and the heart has the same reason. Now, we have unexpectedly suffered from the adverse effects of this smuggling problem, which should be a matter of concern to everyone. In the past, the import of foreign goods was dependent on tariffs, but still cannot enter directly. Now, foreign goods come in a large scale under the power of force. I know that the donations suffered by the state-owned goods manufacturers must be even more than the donations of the national treasury. In terms of disrupting market prices, merchants have felt great pain. This is indeed a fatal injury to our entire country, and a fatal injury to our entire industrial and commercial community. Now, there are two ways to prevent this serious smuggling problem. The first is for the government to formulate various provisions to prevent it, and it is also necessary to rely on the power of the people to work together to deal with this problem. I hope that our various trade associations will take on the responsibility and use various methods to curb the spread of this evil force. They are expanding their military equipment and using it to massacre our people. I think that the people who have a little conscience will never buy these smuggled goods. I heard that various trade associations are planning to initiate the organization of a smuggling prevention committee. I hope that the various trade associations and participants will do their best and work hard. I also hope that one will tell ten, and ten will tell a hundred, so that the people will not buy smuggled foreign goods, and even not buy non-smuggled foreign goods. The second point is that there is a serious problem in the industrial and commercial circles recently, which is the mutual squeeze between the same industry. If A and B have a plan, they will imitate it. As a result, there will be overproduction. If we have a surplus of self-sufficiency and can sell it abroad, that is of course the best. But the fact is not so. As a result of imitation and squeeze, it is inevitable to tend to shoddy. In the end, it will be the same. There are many examples, which is very regrettable. If we continue to kill each other in this way, it is definitely not a good phenomenon. To solve this problem, we must mention control. From the perspective of the means, reasonable control is called control, and unreasonable control is monopoly. We must implement reasonable and legitimate control to curb the squeeze between the same industry, such as the control of silk cocoons in Zhejiang, the control of rubber in Guangdong, the control of silkworm seeds in Jiangsu, and there are also several examples in this city. However, we implement control, especially to have a legal basis, so as to avoid difficulties in implementation. If the various industries have good control measures, this Bureau will do its best to assist and promote its implementation. The above are two opinions that I have contributed to you representatives today, and I wish the conference success.</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui and Sun Ke Arrive in Shanghai Together Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Wang Inspects Nasal Ailment, Sun Jia-zhe and Feng Rui Pay a Visit in the Morning, Plans to Return to Beijing on the Evening of the 24th, No Intention of Going South</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Chonghui, a Central Committee member, departed for Beijing on the evening of the 12th, held meetings with various authorities, and discussed the current situation. As he needed to examine his nasal ailment, he, along with his secretary Feng Zhizheng and Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, left Beijing on the 11:00 PM express train the night before, returning to Shanghai. They arrived at</p>
<p>Zhenru Station at 6:50 AM yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Yang Hu, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison Commander, along with his secretary Wang Zhinan, made a special trip to Zhenru to welcome them. Wang's secretaries Xiao Jinfang and Zhu Yongshou, among others, waited at the North Station but did not meet them. After Wang got off the train, he first switched cars with Sun, and they returned together to Sun's residence on Columbia Road to rest. Afterwards, he returned to the former Minister of Justice Administration, Wei Daoming's residence on Haig Road. Then, at around 9:00 AM, he went out with his secretary Xiao Jinfang to the office of Dr. Wang Aisong, a nasal specialist, to wash his nose, cheek pus, and take X-rays,</p>
<p>Carrying out examination</p>
<p>procedures. After the examination was completed at 11:00 AM, he went to Ferguson Road to visit Li Shizeng, a Central Committee member, to exchange opinions on the current situation. He then returned to his residence for lunch, where he received Cheng Tiangu, a Central Committee member who came from the north, representing Chairman Hu, Sun Jia-zhe, the Director of the Guizhou Provincial Committee and Director of the Joint Taxation Bureau of the Three Provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Guizhou, representing Guangzhou Pacification Director Chen Jitang, and Feng Rui, the Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry. They had all gone to Wei Daoming's residence around 9:30 AM yesterday morning to pay their respects to Wang, but Wang was out seeking medical treatment and did not meet them. Wang then drove out again at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon to</p>
<p>Visit various parties.</p>
<p>He first went to Jing'an Temple Road to visit Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, and talked for half an hour before leaving. He then went to Seymour Road to visit Xu Chongzhi, the Vice President of the Control Yuan, and stayed for a long time. He discussed the current situation with Yu and Xu. He returned to his residence around 4:00 PM and reportedly received many former colleagues from the judicial circle, including Zhu Lihua, the former Acting Minister of Justice Administration. At 7:00 PM in the evening, he attended a joint banquet held by Wu Shang, Chuan Bingchang, Jian Youwen, and other Legislative Yuan members in Shanghai, with President Sun also present. According to Wang's secretaries Feng Zhizheng and</p>
<p>Xiao Jinfang, talking to reporters from the New Voice Society yesterday,</p>
<p>Wang visited all the key figures during this trip to Beijing. His eye ailment improved well in Beijing, but to avoid a recurrence, he specially returned to Shanghai to have a medical examination to prove whether he was fully recovered. This morning (i.e., yesterday morning), he had an X-ray examination, and the results will not be known until tomorrow, but it is understood that there is no major change compared to before going to Beijing. Wang has scheduled to seek medical treatment in the morning and visit friends in the afternoon every day. He originally planned to return to Beijing next Tuesday (i.e., the 23rd), but since there is still an appointment on Wednesday, he can only leave at the earliest on Wednesday evening. Wang had previously sent a telegram to Chen Bonan and has already received a reply. Whether he will send another telegram is still to be determined. He also has no intention of going south. Regarding the news reported in today's newspaper that the Guizhou army has increased its forces to Yongzhou, Wang has not received an official report and does not know what is happening, etc. As for Sun Ke, after arriving in Shanghai yesterday morning, he returned to his residence for a short rest. He first drove to Datong University on Zhongshan Road at around 9:30 AM to attend the school's graduation ceremony and deliver a speech. He also visited various parties and was very busy.</p>
<h3>Wang Kemin Still Staying in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Sent a Telegram Urging Him to Go North, But He Has Not Been Able to Go Due to Arranging Private Matters</p>
<p>Yesterday's telegram from the Tongmeng News Agency in Beiping stated that Song Zheyuan had telegraphed Wang Kemin, inviting him to go north to serve as the Chairman of the Economic Committee, and that he had already obtained his consent. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed Wang yesterday, and according to the conversation: (Question) Is there such a thing as what the Tongmeng News Agency reported? (Answer) Commander Song has repeatedly urged me by telegram since the end of last month and sent personnel to the south to invite me to return north in person. This is indeed the case. However, neither the telegram nor the personnel mentioned the Economic Committee, so there is no so-called consent. (Question) Then does Mr. Wang have any plans to go north? (Answer) Commander Song's intentions are very sincere, and my colleagues and friends in the north are also very much hoping that I will go. I once thought of going to Tianjin temporarily for a short stay and then returning to Shanghai. Recently, because I have not finished arranging my private affairs and there is a patient at home, it is still difficult to go for the time being.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Our Sijiao Fishing Grounds</h3>
<p>Chongming Fifth District Chief Ling Pengcheng Sends a Telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Requesting Negotiations</p>
<p>Ling Pengcheng, the Chief of the Fifth District of Chongming, sent a telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stating: "Liu Fufu and Wang Afa, fishermen from Caiyuan Town, Sijiao, and fourteen others, went to the north of Huawu Mountain in the district to catch fish during their leisure time. From June 3rd to 10th, it was the fourth season, just entering the peak of the fishing season. Suddenly on the 8th, more than ten Japanese fishing vessels, including the Fukuei Maru, the Kazefuji Maru, and unnamed fishing vessels, entered the fishing grounds and completely dragged away 270 sets of fishing gear belonging to the fishermen, including anchor lines, bamboo, and catches. When the Japanese fishermen on the fishing vessels saw that the fishing gear was being dragged away, they not only did not stop the vessels to release them, but clapped and laughed, increased their speed, and sailed north. It has been found that Japanese fishing vessels only started fishing in the northeast area of Yushan four years ago, invading our territorial waters. Now they have invaded south to Huawu Mountain, and they have violated the universally recognized division between sailboat fishing vessels, dragging away the dragging nets of 14 out of the only 18 households in the fifth district of Chongming. Among them, ten households are unable to go to sea because all ten sets or more have been dragged away. In terms of fishing gear, each set costs 30 yuan, totaling a loss of 3,820 yuan. In terms of catches, the loss is also 9,600 yuan, totaling 13,420 yuan. At a time when fishing villages are declining and the lives of fishermen are already extremely difficult, they are now suffering the loss of money and fishing gear, and their livelihoods have been cut off. We earnestly request the higher authorities to grant loans for relief and, on the one hand, negotiate with the Japanese ambassador to demand compensation for the loss and guarantee that such incidents will not occur again in the future, etc." (The following is omitted) It is heard that the fishing gear dragged away by the Japanese fishing vessels includes two sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Wang Ahuan, twelve sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Wang Afa, ten sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Xie Guangfa, eleven sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Zhu Pinlong, five sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Yu Zhong, fourteen sets of bamboo belonging to Zhu Xiaogou, fifteen sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Liu Fufu, eleven sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Ren Ayuan, fifteen sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Liu Ayin, fourteen sets of anchor nets and bamboo belonging to Liu Jiancheng, three sets of bamboo belonging to Huang Daquan, two sets of bamboo belonging to Wang Xiaofa, seven sets of bamboo belonging to Wang A Gao, and six sets of bamboo belonging to Zhu Agen.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Letters to Various Industries Soliciting Methods for Inspecting Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to twenty-one trade associations, including the silk and satin industry, the woolen industry, the electrical machinery and silk weaving industry, the knitting industry, and the hardware industry, stating: "Respectfully, the Smuggling Problem Research Committee has already convened a joint meeting of representatives from various industries and decided to form a committee of twelve members. At a meeting held by the committee at 4:00 PM on the 18th of this month, it was decided to pass a proposal for various industries to jointly request the passage of this year's members' congress, which will be handed over to the Executive Committee to select representatives from various industries to organize the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Smuggling Inspection Committee, formulate regulations, lead various industries, and assist the government in investigating and cracking down on smuggled goods. Solicit from various industries, for the inspection of smuggled goods, if a method has been drafted, or if there are rules and regulations, please send the entire copy to the chamber for reference in formulating the rules and regulations for the Smuggling Inspection Committee. Correspondingly, it is hoped that you will check and if there are materials related to the method of inspecting smuggling, please provide them to the chamber for reference."</p>
<h3>Labor Claims Have the Highest Priority for Repayment</h3>
<p>Approved by the Executive Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>Yesterday, an order was issued to the Municipal General Labor Union for notification</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union had previously submitted petitions to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the issue of labor claims having the highest priority for repayment, requesting the formulation of laws stipulating that labor claims should have the highest priority for repayment. It also sent standing committee members Zhou Xuexiang, Zhang Kechang, and Long Peiyun to Beijing to petition. The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to review and reply. The Ministry, after careful review, believed that factories owing workers wages were not permitted by law. However, due to the economic downturn in China's industry and commerce, owing wages has become a common phenomenon. Various enterprises often suspend, close down, or go bankrupt due to a shortage of funds. If workers' wages and other statutory benefits do not have a clear provision for the right of priority repayment, then workers will have no way to recover the price of their sweat and blood. This is not only contrary to humanitarianism, but also contrary to the party's intention to protect workers. When two or more types of priority claims are listed, workers should also be the first creditors and have the right to be repaid first. If the remaining assets of the employer's enterprise after suspension, closure, or bankruptcy are not enough to repay the workers' debts, the shareholders of the enterprise should be responsible for guaranteeing to make up the difference. It is only in this way that the rights and interests of workers can be effectively guaranteed. Therefore, this intention was reported to the Executive Yuan, and the 267th meeting of the Yuan decided to pass it and send it to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Municipal General Labor Union has already received the Executive Yuan's Order No. 703 for notification yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government is Organizing the Shanghai Branch of the National Economic Construction Council</h3>
<p>Xu Fu is Appointed as the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee</p>
<p>General Chiang believed that the crisis in the national economy was becoming increasingly serious. If efforts were not made to engage in construction, there would be no way to save the country and survive. To complete this task, it was necessary for the people of the whole country to rise up and catch up, pool their efforts, and implement it quickly and effectively. In order to implement national economic construction, the General Regulations of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee have been formulated, and all provinces and cities have been instructed to set up associations. The Shanghai Municipal Government has been ordered to actively prepare for the organization of the Shanghai Municipal Branch of the National Economic Construction Committee and has appointed Xu Fu, the Director of the Finance Bureau, Wu Xingya, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhou Yongneng, a Counselor of the Municipal Government, as members of the preparatory committee, and designated the latter as the Chairman of the preparatory committee to carry out the preparations.</p>

<h3>The State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Currently Has No Plans to Reduce Freight Rates</h3>
<p>Regarding the report in yesterday's newspaper that the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will implement a reduction in freight rates for both through and non-through goods next month, the person in charge of the company claimed that this news was not true. The cost of green freight is fixed, and the current freight rates are very low, which is still insufficient to cover the cost. Therefore, there is no such plan to reduce freight rates at this time.</p>

<p>Terrible Prophecy</p>
<h3>In September of Next Year, a New Planet Will Collide with the Earth, the Collision Site is the Asian Continent</h3>
<p>Hong Kong and Guangdong Suffer the Most, Sulu and Other Provinces are in the Danger Zone</p>
<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that the greatest contribution of scientists this year is the discovery of a new planet very close to Earth. According to research by scientists from various countries around the world, the planet will collide with the Asian continent. Hong Kong and Guangdong will suffer the most. The predictors are all speculating about the tragedy of this disaster and rescue measures such as immigration. According to a person from Hong Kong, this theory is very popular there. The people of Hong Kong are all terrified after hearing this theory. The American scientist Henry Norris Russell recently published a paper stating that on February 12th of this year, the astronomer G. Burteau from the Belgian National Observatory was the first to discover a large planet. After a joint examination, the orbit of the star that is separated from the earth is transverse to the orbit of the earth, within the constellation of Leo. Because the new planet is moving very fast, 20 miles per second, which is 8 to 10 times faster than the average speed of the asteroids between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, it is rarely seen. Now astronomers from the United States and Europe have unanimously confirmed that the discovery of this new planet is correct and are paying close attention to it. The orbit of this star is very close to Venus, Earth, and Mars, but because the orbit of the Earth is flat and not as high as others, the risk is less. The initial discovery of this star was on February 7th of this year, when it was 80 million miles away from Earth. However, due to the speed of the Earth's movement and the period of this star's orbit, which is September 30th, if the two pass each other, they will collide only once every 125,000 years. According to a prediction from the Harvard University Observatory in the United States, this new planet will collide with the Earth in September of next year. People around the world feel uneasy. Later, after research by scientists from various countries around the world, it was jointly announced that the collision site between the planet and the Earth would be in Asia. Hong Kong and Guangdong would suffer the most, and there is a risk of submersion. The affected disaster areas include the entire South China, as far as Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and other provinces, as well as the Philippine Islands, the entire Vietnam, and Eastern Russia, etc., which will all fall into the scope of the danger zone. If the new planet really collides with the Earth, this unprecedented catastrophe is truly unimaginable. I hope that the people of the country will also pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Health Report for May: Malaria and Typhoid Increase</h3>
<p>Residents Should Cooperate to Eliminate Mosquitoes, Anti-Epidemic Injections Have Begun</p>
<p>According to the report of the Health Department of the Public Works Department in May, in addition to influenza and tuberculosis, the respiratory infectious diseases that were prevalent in the previous month have now slightly subsided. The mortality rate of Chinese residents in this month has not changed much compared to the previous month. The diseases that have seen a sharp increase in visibility this month are primarily malaria, especially in the east and west suburban areas. The number of reported cases of typhoid fever has also increased sharply, with a total of sixty-one cases. Regarding the spread of malaria, the health authorities earnestly hope for the attention and cooperation of citizens, and vehicles coming from the suburbs to the central district should pay attention to not carrying mosquitoes. The mosquitoes in the central district are mostly from the countryside, and cars are the tools for their migration. Therefore, car owners should spray the interior of the car with insecticide before starting, otherwise, they should drive them out of the car before driving. This measure is of great benefit to the public. As for mosquito eradication, petroleum has been injected into ditches and stagnant water by the health authorities, and inspections of various residences are also being carried out unremittingly. If residents can cooperate at any time, they will naturally achieve twice the result with half the effort. In addition, one case of choleraic diarrhea was discovered in the eastern district of the Public Concession, but it was not true cholera. Therefore, residents should pay serious attention to food and drink. Anti-epidemic injections began on May 1st, starting with factories in the east and west districts. In one month, a total of 34,600 people were injected, including 2,700 rickshaw pullers. Vaccination continues for fifteen days due to the risk of occasional outbreaks of smallpox, and the number of people vaccinated has increased by more than 17,600.</p>
<p>Assassination of Tang Jiapeng</p>
<h3>The Appeal Case of Gu Zhuxuan and Wang Xinggao: The High Court Third Branch Concludes its Hearing</h3>
<p>Wang Xinggao was tried in the morning, Gu Zhuxuan in the afternoon. The total trial time lasted nine hours. The result is scheduled for pronouncement at 2:00 PM on the 26th.</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, the former owner of the Chanwu Stage from Yancheng, and Wang Xinggao, from Funing, were suspected of instigating the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World. After being reported by the accomplices Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, they were arrested by the judicial police and sent to the Special Second Court for prosecution. Dissatisfied with the death sentence in the first instance, they appealed separately to the Third Branch of the High Court. On February 4th of this year, the case was concluded on the same day, with the judgment scheduled for the 11th. During this period, there were further incidents of a convict retracting his confession and giving false testimony, and a guard escaping. As a result, the High Court revoked the final debate and reopened the debate.</p>
<p>Delayed until now</p>
<p>It has been four months. After the new cases were heard and judged, the Third Branch of the High Court scheduled the appeal case of Gu and Wang for trial on the same day yesterday. As reported by this newspaper, yesterday morning, Judges Liao and Wang, together with Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, led the clerk Si Wujiayu to conduct the trial in the First Criminal Court. The appellant Wang Xinggao was brought to the court. Wang's defense lawyer also arrived on time. The court first questioned Wang's age, place of residence, and occupation, and then announced</p>
<p>Renewal of Trial</p>
<p>Ordering Wang to state the reasons for his appeal, Wang stated that Zhao Guangfu, who accused him of instigating the murder, originally named Zhao Debiao, had committed arson and robbery in the north before. He was ordered to arrest him but failed, which led to him framing me. In the detention center, he heard a political prisoner, Liu Guobao, say to him that Zhao claimed that his wife had been raped by me, so he falsely accused me, using Wang Jinkui, who was at large. In June of the 22nd year (of the Republic), when he was the warden of the No. 1 Prison in Wuchang, he returned to Shanghai on July 28th. Two days before Tang Jiapeng was killed on June 18th, on June 16th, he was in Hankou to welcome his fellow townsman Zhang Jun and</p>
<p>Took a Photo Together</p>
<p>The photo has already been submitted as evidence. The accusation of instigating Tang's murder is truly unjust. The court interrogated him about whether the photo could be forged. Tang was killed on June 18th, and you could have notified others a few days before to carry out the instigation. Wang vehemently denied the accusation, claiming that he had no grudges with Tang, so why would he instigate others to kill him, and he could not have asked Zhao Guangfu to kill him. When asked if he had ever had a master or accepted disciples, he flatly denied it. He had previously been a student of Si Shiren, an adjutant under Sun Chuanfang. If Zhang Tinggui is my disciple, I</p>
<p>Would Die Without Regret</p>
<p>When asked if he knew Gu Zhuxuan, he replied that they were from the same town and had met once, but had no dealings with each other. At this point, the court ordered that the accusing convict Zhao Guangfu be brought to the court. He was given a draft text and asked to sign it after confirming it. According to Zhao's statement, Wang Xinggao and Wang Jinkui are indeed two different people. He was actually called by Zhou, a carpenter who was at large, and had nothing to do with Wang Xinggao. In prison, he and Xue Yi discussed falsely accusing Wang Xinggao for money. Now, he is</p>
<p>Speaking from his Conscience</p>
<p>After the court repeatedly questioned Zhao, his testimony became evasive. The court then summoned Zhang Tinggui. Zhang testified that he did not recognize Wang Xinggao as his disciple. The one who instigated the killing of Tang Jiapeng was Wang Jinkui, who was at large. Wang has scars on both cheeks. He also claimed that he had obtained a passbook with 2,000 yuan in it at the guard post, and asked me to retract my confession and accuse Gu Zhuxuan, under the direction of Zhao Guangfu, to jointly defraud money. I have already been sued, what's the use of money, so I refused and immediately reported it. At the end of the interrogation, the court ordered Gu Zhi to be brought to the court to testify. Gu testified that Wang Xinggao was from the same town and had met occasionally, but had no dealings with him. He did not know who Wang Jinkui was</p>
<p>What Kind of Person He Was</p>
<p>Nor was he his disciple. Questioned about the killer's confession that he met with the killers at the Dajiangnan Hotel, etc., and the circumstances of instigating the murder, Gu claimed that nothing of the sort had happened. Asked, since there was no such thing, why did he go to Hangzhou when Wang Xinggao was arrested? Gu replied that he had a villa in Hangzhou and lived there from time to time. The officer then questioned Wang Xinggao again. Since the case had been thoroughly investigated, after the debate between Gu Guoxi, the lawyer from the police department, and Ma and Wu, the defense lawyers for the appellant, the court then announced the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the judgment for 2:00 PM on the 26th. The appellant and the proposing witnesses were returned to court, and it was already 1:30 PM. Gu Zhuxuan's appeal case was tried in the afternoon. Gu's elder brother Songmao, his wives Li and Cai, his relative Zheng Jian'er, and the guard chief Wu Jing, guard Ma Xianxiang, and the original accusers Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui, who were related to the case, were all summoned to court. The questioning continued until 3:05 PM. Zhu Qianchang, together with Judges Wang and Liao, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao, Clerk Si, etc., presided over the interrogation in the First Criminal Court. Yao Zhaoji, a lawyer from the police department, appeared in court as a representative. The three defense lawyers appointed by the appellant also arrived on time. After the court session, the officer ordered the appellant Gu Zhuzhi to be brought to the court. After first questioning his age, place of residence, and occupation,</p>
<p>The Court Announced</p>
<p>The debate in this case is reopened and the trial is renewed. Order Gu to state the reasons for his appeal. Gu claimed that he had been sick for a long time and his hands and feet were swollen. He requested to be allowed to sit down to be questioned. The officer discussed waiting for you to finish speaking before you can sit down. Gu then testified that he had never killed anyone and did not know Zhao Guangfu or Zhang Tinggui. He had never been to the Asia Hotel or the Dajiangnan Hotel. Zhao and others wanted to extort money from me, so they falsely accused me. They had extorted money from Xu Changrong and others. Asked, since there was no instigation of murder, why did he go to Hangzhou? He had his own villa in Hangzhou and went there from time to time, it was not to escape.</p>
<p>It is Truly Unjust</p>
<p>Requesting justice. Asked, you said Zhao extorted you, then there were several letters, why not report it immediately, only to bring it up after the police arrested you. These letters are not simply letters asking for money, they can be ignored. But this concerns human life, how important, shouldn't you think for yourself? Answer, at that time I was sick and being treated in Puji Hospital, and the family received the letter. Since they had been sentenced to life imprisonment and twenty years, they didn't know how to send money to the prison. But the relative Zheng Jian'er saw the letter and said that he wanted to pursue it. At that time, the family</p>
<p>Because I was Sick</p>
<p>Also did not pursue it, this is the family's mistake. Because I was the head of the security group, I took a car to the municipal government and was injured on the way. I was treated at Puji Hospital and only five days after being discharged, I received a court warrant and was arrested. There is absolutely no conflict between me opening the Tianchan and the superiors, it is really someone who wants to harm me. I can't say who the enemy is now. The one who sent the flyers and anonymous letters was done by one person. Even if ten people say I am a suspect, there must be evidence. Zhao and others said that I killed someone, and said that there were eight people in the meeting, requesting a thorough investigation. If even a little evidence is found,</p>
<p>I am Willing to Accept the Crime</p>
<p>Asked, why doesn't Zhao accuse other fellow villagers, but accuses you? Answer, Wang Xinggao was also accused by them. Asked, the 2,000 yuan passbook under the name of Zhang Sen at the Daya Bank is suspected to be yours. Answer, no, I have been detained for a long time, there is no one at home, my eldest daughter has married, my youngest boy is in school, and my elder brother is also working in society. There is absolutely no such thing as paying money for me to be sued. At this point in the interrogation, the court ordered Gu Songmao, Gu Cai (who did not arrive), Gu Li, Zheng Jian'er, and the three others who testified in the case to leave the court. Asked, Gu, you have been detained in the Guangci Hospital prison for a long time? Answer, no. The officer said to Gu, you don't have to deny it. This court has obtained your case file, which states that you asked Director Wu to ask the guard Ma Xianxiang to ask Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai to say to Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui,</p>
<p>Asking Them to Retract Their Confessions</p>
<p>And give Zhang Tinggui the Zhang Sen account, is that so? Gu replied, there must be evidence, where was it said, I am now ruined, where would I get so much money? Moreover, Zhao blackmailed me at the time, and the inmate Guo Shanyu also blackmailed me unsuccessfully. He reported that I smoked, how could I smoke in the prison ward? The court said that the Zhang Sen account was deposited on February 2nd, and there was also a Wang Chunhua account, which was deposited on January 31st. The officer gave Gu the Zhang Sen account to read. Gu replied that he had never seen it before. Asked, when this court opened last time, Zhao and Zhang both retracted their confessions, wasn't it all the power of money? Answer, every time they open the court,</p>
<p>Their Confessions are Different</p>
<p>Asked, according to Zhang Xiaosizi (i.e., Tinggui)'s presentation, the first time you asked someone to say that you would give him 1,000 yuan, asking him to retract his confession, Zhang refused. The second time you asked Ma Xianxiang to say that you would give him 2,000 yuan, Zhang still refused, and then added up to 2,500 yuan, Zhang only agreed. Answer, the Ma surname has never spoken to me once. Asked Ma Xianxiang to ask Cao Shida to write a note on his behalf to Zhang, and after retracting the confession, give the account to Zhang, Zhang agreed, and also showed the note to Gu. Answer, I don't have such things at all, I need to bring the Ma surname to the court to understand. Asked if there was a guard impersonating you and asking for money at your home? Answer, according to family members who came to meet me, they said that there were</p>
<p>Poor People Impersonating</p>
<p>Asking for ten or eight yuan at home, but the family did not give it to him. Asked, did you meet Zhao Guangfu on the first floor of the Dajiangnan Hotel? Answer, no. Asked, did Wang Xinggao meet at Renjiangnan? Answer, no. Asked, Wang Jinkui knew you as a fellow villager? Answer, I don't know him. Among the fellow villagers, there is only Wang Xinggao, not Wang Jinkui. Killing is secret, how can you talk about it in the hotel? Moreover, I have no grudges with Tang Jiapeng, why would I spend tens of thousands of dollars to kill him? Asked, do you have any grudges with Tang Jiapeng? Answer,</p>
<p>No Grudges at All</p>
<p>Neither sharing wealth nor the same industry. At this point, Zhao Guangfu was brought to the court. Asked, Gu Zhuxuan, is it you who accused him? Answer, yes. The officer ordered Zhao to state the process of how Gu instigated the murder. Zhao replied, I have always known each other, but Gu was not present at all in the murder. It was Zhou Ermujiang, that is, Zhou Mingxiang, who called me. He only said that it was the enemy of a friend, and I did not ask his name. Asked, Zhao discussed it a few days before killing Tang? Answer, this matter has been going on for several years, the corpse is forgotten, and I can't remember clearly. Asked, you can't remember the date of the murder, is it just killing people casually? Answer, killing people was not a big deal at first, and only after committing the crime did I know that</p>
<p>National Law is Serious</p>
<p>The court then checked the previous volume and questioned Zhao. Zhao actually pretended to be funny and answered incoherently. Zhao's answer to the court's questioning was evasive and cunning. He should speak the truth from his conscience, but Zhao still contradicted himself. Asked, Zhao, you said before that Gu Zhuxuan instigated the murder, but now you suddenly say that Gu was not involved, what is going on? Answer, speaking from my conscience, Gu Zhuzhi was really not involved. If you want to ask about what I said before, please bring Zhu Jincheng to ask him. This matter was planned by Xue Zhenyi and others to extort Gu. Later, Xue turned around and helped Gu speak. Asked, in the letter you gave to Xue Zhenyi, you said that you did not know Gu and only recognized Gu's photo when you saw it in the Oriental Magazine. Why did you just say that you have always known Gu? Answer, Gu was in</p>
<p>The Tianchan Stage</p>
<p>When he was running the refugee shelter, he went to the shelter once every day. When he distributed money to the Jiangbei people returning home, I saw him. He also detailed the process of seeing the guard Ma Xianxiang and others who were at large in the prison and having the passbook taken away by Zhang Qiancui. The officer ordered Zhang Tinggui to be brought to the court. After showing Zhang the passbook on the table, Zhang confessed that the passbook was indeed his. First, the guard Wang Yushou said to me, asking me to retract my confession, and I refused. Later, Ma Xianxiang asked me to retract my confession. The first time, he showed me the passbook under the name of Wang Chunhua. I took it over, and he asked me to put it at Cao Qida's office at No. 879, and asked me to return the passbook to him. I did not fill it. The next morning, Ma also gave me the seal and asked me to return the passbook to him. I did not fill it. The next morning, Ma also showed me Zhang Sen's passbook about the Tang murder. Gu met me on June 13 of the 22nd year at Room 208 of the Dajiangnan Hotel. Then he claimed that he was at</p>
<p>Asia Hotel</p>
<p>Involved in negotiations, with Wang Jinkui, Zhou Qifu, Gu Dunchi and others in the scene. The court questioned him that his confession in the police department and the local court was that from June 3rd to 17th, he went to the Asia Hotel every day to discuss the murder of Tang. Why is the current confession different from the previous one and contradictory? Zhang then attributed it to the threats during the initial investigation by the police. The officer then asked Gu Chongzhi whether Zhang Qiancui's confession was clear to him. Gu replied that Zhang's confession was completely fabricated and that he spoke differently every time. The court summoned Gu's brother Gu Songmao to testify, who was 55 years old and worked in the car business. Chongzhi is his own brother. After being arrested, I came to meet him at Guangci Hospital. First, I registered at the guard post and received a slip, and sent someone to accompany me to send the slip in. Zhu Xuan was inside, and I was talking outside. There were three guards next to me, and detectives and Annamite patrols</p>
<p>Supervising from Behind</p>
<p>The prosecutor summoned me to interrogate, and I only knew Director Wu, but I didn't know which surname Wu was. When I met, the guard asked us to speak in a high voice, not low, to prevent any transgression. Director Shun has not been to my house. I don't know the Ma surname. I don't know about the Daya Bank deposit. Zheng Jian'er is my brother-in-law. I have never deposited money with Zheng and Ma Xianxiang. It was only when the prosecutor summoned me that I learned that Zhang Xiaosizi had bitten my brother and was suing him. He is an enemy, so he would not give money to them again. Zheng Jian'er testified that he was related to Gu Zhuxuan by marriage. After Chongxuan was arrested, I did not help him. There are many people in his family. Chongxuan has been detained for mental illness since April last year. I have never visited him once, and I have never deposited money with Gu Songmao to</p>
<p>Daya Bank</p>
<p>On April 6th of last year, I saw Xue Zhenyi's letter and immediately suggested that Gu report it to the police station or report it to the court for investigation. Gu Li said that Cai had gone to Yancheng for business, and the family affairs were managed by her husband at home. When he was not at home, we managed our own affairs. The third brother (i.e., Songmao) does not often come to my house. My brother-in-law Zheng does not come to my house. My husband is in Huangci Hospital, and sometimes I go to meet him, or others go to meet him. No guard came to my house to get money. Moreover, the family is very poor now, there is no money, and there is no such thing as giving 4,000 yuan to the third brother to deposit in the bank. Cai would not have money to deposit in the bank either. After the court finished questioning, the three witnesses then ordered the guard Ma Xianxiang of the guard post to testify. He worked as a guard at the guard post and was not assigned to Guangci Hospital. He did not know the brothers Ma Xianxiang and Xiancai in the countryside. They talked about it in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Family Uncle</p>
<p>Wu Jing is the director of the guard and is assigned to serve in the external prison ward. He does not see him often. He does not talk to him when he comes to the office. He denied receiving bribes from Wu and the second Qing Bureau Ma Xianxiang. If there was such a thing, he would have escaped long ago. Would I not escape and eat lawsuits here? Please be clear. Finally, he ordered Wu Jing to come to the court to testify. He worked as the director of the guard at the guard post. He was assigned to Guangci Hospital on October 1st of last year and before February 4th of this year. Gu's family members came to meet him and registered first. He had never been to Gu's house, and there was no Xiaosizi's confession last year. Asked now, Zhang Xiaosizi's confession is very clear, answer</p>
<p>If There Was Such a Thing</p>
<p>I would have escaped long ago. At this point, the court considered that the investigation and interrogation were completed and ordered the debate. First, Chief Prosecutor Zhao expressed his opinion, stating that the confessions of the two accusers were contradictory and should not be adopted, etc. Then the Yao lawyer from the police department and the appeal and the defense lawyer for the person debated for a long time. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment for 2:00 PM on the 26th. The appellant and Zhao Zhangma Wu were still remanded, and the others were dismissed. The Trial</p>
<p>Lasted Five and a Half Hours</p>
<p>When the court was dismissed, it was almost 9:00 PM. After the court was dismissed, Judge Wang Yue questioned Gu Zhuxuan. Now there are thieves Zheng Xiangshan and Dongpo, appealing in Suzhou Shangdeng Court, saying that at the time of the crime, the two of them happened to be in the refugee shelter in Jiangbei during the January 28th Incident. Do you know whether the two of them were in the shelter at that time? Gu replied that he needed to check the register of the Jianghuai Fellow Villagers Association to find out. The officer immediately ordered Gu to investigate and reply. At 5:00 PM, Gu ordered to collect the list of the two criminals and asked his brother Songmao to help check with the fellow villagers association and submit it to the court.</p>

On the day of the crime, I was watching the wind at the intersection of Hengfeng Road and Gonghe Road. After the hostage was kidnapped, I saw their car drive north and kill the accountant. It is said that Chen Weilong shot him. We had a boat parked in advance in Nanxiang, and at that time the hostages were sent to the boat and sailed to Wuxi. I was listening to the news in Shanghai and wrote two letters to negotiate with the hostage family but did not receive a reply. I went to Wuxi this time for only three or four days, unexpectedly I was arrested and brought to Shanghai. After we kidnapped the hostages, one person gets one share, whoever has a pistol gets half a share, but the box cannon gets a full share. Sun Xiaolong is my sworn brother and Chen Youfang's second landlord. Sun Xiaolong has nothing to do with this case.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Company: Increased Number of Public Telephones</h3>
<p>Lower Fees, Greater Convenience for the Public</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Telephone Company, since the Shanghai Telephone Company implemented the pay-per-use method on March 1st, the number of public telephones has also increased to about seven times. Before February 28th, there were only 31 public telephones in Shanghai, and now it has increased to 200. According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, the company is currently planning to expand this telephone service, and it has achieved remarkable results in the past three months. In the future, the telephone equipment in Shanghai will be on par with major cities around the world. As for the purpose of installing public telephones, it is nothing more than to facilitate the citizens of Shanghai, who can use them anytime and anywhere. The installation locations are now generally major buildings, banks, department stores, restaurants, markets, parks, piers, and shops in major bustling streets. In the future, the company plans to gradually increase the number of installations wherever needed. Regarding the cost to the public, it is now more economical. Previously, each call cost about a dime (small silver coin), which is about seven cents (big silver coin), but now you only need to buy a five-cent coin to use the public telephone. To talk to Zhabei, Nanshi, and other places in the city, you only need a dime, which is two five-cent coins. This service is welcomed by the general public, which can be proven by the increase in the number of public telephones.</p>

<h3>Women Representatives from This City Petitioned in Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>

<h3>Silk Factory Trade Association Urgently Cables Zhejiang Provincial Government Requesting Prompt Release of Retained Cocoons</h3>
<p>Due to Dampness</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Commission previously retained the local cocoons taken by Shanghai because the price was not appropriate. Although the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association telegraphed for their release, a portion was permitted to be released, with the remainder awaiting reeling tests. However, as the days passed and a solution was not fully resolved, and dampness ensued, Mr. Chen Fangzhou, the manager of Tailun Silk Factory on Chang'an Road, reported to the Trade Association yesterday morning that he had received a letter from Lanxing in Zhejiang, informing him that the retained cocoons had become damp and moldy, requesting prompt action. The association telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Sericulture Control Commission again yesterday, stating, "According to a report from member Guangyuan Silk Factory, the local spring cocoons purchased at the Tonghe Cocoon Market in Xintang, Deqing County, are of very poor quality due to weather conditions. The reeling yield was tested at 673 catties, and the Control Commission calculated the price, which was slightly below the central price, retaining 311 bales and not allowing their transport. However, sampling and reeling tests have not yet been announced. We believe this matter is quite dangerous. First, cocoon market insurance has a fixed term. If, unfortunately, an accident occurs, will the insurance company be responsible for compensation? Second, the inland cocoon markets only supply temporary needs. The soil is damp and heavy, and with the moldy weather, insect infestations and rot are inevitable. Third, silk merchants borrow capital from financial institutions to purchase cocoons. Retaining the cocoons for too long will have a serious impact on financial turnover. Fourth, with the changing of the seasons, factories urgently need raw materials. Holding the cocoons for too long will halt silk merchants' work, inevitably causing panic. Please convey our difficulties and earnestly request prompt reeling tests and transport. Based on the above, we urgently telegraph. We respectfully request your association to promptly investigate and process this matter so that the retained cocoons can be released and transported as soon as possible to meet reeling needs, which would be both beneficial for the public and convenient for businesses. Respectfully, the Committee of the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association."</p>
<h3>Thief Stealing Guns from the District Court Refuses to Confess Accomplices</h3>
<p>The thief Wang Xiao'a Yu is utterly unreasonable</p>
<p>Detective Chen Yonggui Compensates One Dollar and Twenty Cents</p>
<p>The Shanghai District Court's stolen goods warehouse was broken into on the night of May 9th by a major thief, who stole twenty new-style pistols, forty-three bullets, and a wireless radio. The court requested all agencies to issue an arrest warrant. Liu Junqing, the detective chief of the Yulin Road Police Station, and detective Chen Yonggui arrested the suspects, Wang Xiao'a Yu and Wang Shi, and confiscated twelve stolen guns and bullets. They were transferred to the Public Security Bureau and confessed that Chen A'san, a former public servant, was an accomplice. They were sent to the District Court and ordered to be detained. Yesterday, Prosecutor Xie of the District Court summoned the original detective Chen Yonggui to the case to detail the circumstances of the arrest. The defendant tried to sell pistols to the detective, leading to the arrest. The defendant confessed to stealing guns at the police station but refused to reveal any accomplices. Wang Xiao'a Yu was brought to the case and remained stubborn, even telling the detective that he had lost a shirt worth one dollar and twenty cents at the police station and demanded compensation. The detective, finding him utterly unreasonable, gave him one dollar and twenty cents. The suspect accepted the money and remained silent, then was returned to custody. The suspect's behavior is quite strong-willed.</p>
<h3>A Widow Cohabitates with a Monk</h3>
<p>A Thug Seizes the Opportunity to Extort Two Hundred Dollars</p>
<p>Dishonoring the Family, Severing Family Ties</p>
<p>The monk Gu Yuanjia, aged twenty-nine, formerly ordained at the Yangchun Temple in Xin Zhuang, was expelled by the abbot for improper conduct and bad habits. Later, he became a guest master at the Panlong Great Temple. Last winter, Gu Yuan met Sun, the widow of the late wealthy businessman Guo, in the Pu Song District of Western Shanghai. They fell in love at first sight and began a close relationship. Recently, their affair intensified, and they dared to secretly invite Gu Yuan to her home for a rendezvous. Wang A'gen, Gu Liansheng, and other local thugs found out, gathered a group of people the night before, and caught the shameless couple in the act. After mediation, Sun paid two hundred dollars to disperse them. When the Guo clan elder learned of this, he considered the woman's failure to remain a widow a disgrace to the family and severed family ties.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Bank Launches Small Loans for Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>In recent years, the cries of economic depression have spread across the country, with industry and commerce being the most affected. The capital turnover of industry and commerce has always relied on money houses for adjustments. Since money houses in various places have successively closed down, local finance has been exhausted. The suffering of large-scale industry and commerce is not discussed here, but the small-scale industry and commerce in the surrounding areas are mostly unable to obtain loans, leading to the gradual decline of the market, directly affecting the livelihood of the common people and indirectly endangering the entire social economy. Jiangsu Bank, aware of the urgency of the environment, specially applied to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval to launch small commercial loans. If industrial and commercial firms within the mainland (excluding the two special cities of Beijing and Shanghai) that have joined trade associations need to borrow money, the local association can apply to the local Chamber of Commerce for review and certification and then apply to the bank for a loan.</p>
<h3>All Circles Sponsor the Purchase of Aircraft to Celebrate a Birthday</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association is expanding the aviation rescue movement. The Shanghai Fundraising Committee for the Purchase of Aircraft to Present to the Government as a Memorial for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Fiftieth Birthday has begun work and has been making every effort in recent months, relying on enthusiastic support from compatriots from all walks of life and generous donations. The results are excellent. All entertainment venues in the city have set aside one day to transfer their income to donations. Major theaters and entertainment venues have generally held events, details of which are published in various newspapers. Regarding dance halls, since the Saint Anna Dance Hall initiated a charity fair and transferred the day's income to purchase aircraft for birthday celebrations, the Continental, Far East, and Great East dance halls have successively responded. Now the Old Dahua, International, Xiaoyao, Haoyou, Victory, and other dance halls have all decided to hold events, which will be held in the coming days.</p>
<p>The Aircraft Commemoration Association continued to receive donations yesterday: Mr. Wang Yiting, through Mr. Yan Weilian, donated 1,000 yuan; Mr. Pan Gongzhan, through the Silk Industry Association, donated 100 yuan; Mr. Wu Yunzhai donated 100 yuan; Mr. Yang Shousheng donated 400 yuan; and Dafeng Hengjin Pawnshop donated 20 yuan.

<h3>Lantern Parade in Nanshi Tomorrow Evening</h3>
<p>Fire Extinguishers and Fire Bombs Demonstrated at 2 PM</p>
<p>The lantern parade initiated by the Shanghai National Products Exhibition will be held tomorrow evening at 7 PM, parading around the city in Nanshi. There will also be gifts distributed to guests. The lanterns prepared by the association are exquisite. The association convened discussions with various factories in advance and decided that all lanterns should conform to the factories' products and trademarks, with the rest being slogan lanterns. For example, the Golden Rooster Biscuits produced by Taifeng Food Company will be made into golden rooster lanterns. Other factories, such as Arden Electric Light Factory, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Meiya Silk Weaving Factory, and Sino-French Pharmacy, are striving for beauty rather than vying for novelty. In addition to the participating manufacturers of the National Products Exhibition, Zhongxi Pharmacy, Dingxin Soap Factory, Meiling Industrial Society, National Products Company, Asia Oil Ear Electric Appliance Factory, and others will also participate. It is heard that the association has also invited Pinghu Lantern Company and Xiashi Paper Umbrella Lantern Company to participate. It is said that all lanterns will be completed on the 21st, and lantern carriers have also been hired, so the parade will be held on the 22nd as scheduled without further delay. At 2 PM that afternoon, the effectiveness of the fire extinguishers and fire bombs produced by Jinqiu Industrial Society in the city will be demonstrated in Penglai Garden. The city government approved the request yesterday, stating, "The petition to hold a lantern parade for the National Products Movement is approved for implementation. Please instruct the Municipal Public Security Bureau to provide protection along the route to ensure safety." This approval.</p>

<h3>Ginseng Placenta Golden Pill is Truly a Sacred Medicine for Gynecology</h3>
<p>The Shen family, gynecological experts from Tianguanfang, Suzhou, have a secret recipe for Ginseng Placenta Golden Pill. It dispels weakness and replenishes deficiency, regulates menstruation and promotes fertility, calms the fetus and ensures safe delivery, strengthens both mother and child, and treats various gynecological ailments with remarkable and rapid efficacy. It is truly a sacred medicine for gynecology. Since the ancestor Shen Weitian resigned from his official post to practice medicine in seclusion, he meticulously researched and improved the recipe, enhancing its efficacy. For over ninety years since its introduction, it has been highly praised and widely renowned. At a time when powerful neighbors are eyeing us covetously and the nation's situation is precarious, the people, in addition to strengthening their bodies, must cultivate healthy new citizens with sound pre- and post-natal development to erase the shame of being the "Sick Man of East Asia." To meet social needs and convenience patrons, a special general management office has been established at No. 10 Ren'an Lane, Guling Road, British Concession, and is also distributed at major pharmacies and drugstores. The pill has been registered and certified by the National Government, and renowned physicians have inscribed words of praise, proving its complete medicinal effectiveness, worthy of being called the gospel for women. Ladies and celebrities within the country should give it a try.</p>

<h3>Heavyweight Boxing Match: Schmeling Knocks Out Louis</h3>
<p>German Propaganda Minister Sends Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th: Former world heavyweight champion German Schmeling fought a 15-round match with current champion Black boxer Joe Louis today. By the tenth round, Schmeling was blinded in one eye by a punch, but continued to fight bravely. In the twelfth round, the black overlord Joe Louis fell to the ground under the barrage of left and right punches from his opponent and could not get up. Schmeling thus won the victory.</p>
<p>Unexpected Harvest</p>
<p>There were 70,000 spectators at this match, with ticket revenue of US$750,000. Before the match, Joe Louis' victory was highly favored, with some even setting odds of nine to one as the standard for winning points, and five to one for a knockout. Unexpectedly, Schmeling made a comeback and succeeded in one fell swoop, reaping an unexpected harvest. At the same time, his case of tax evasion accusations by the US authorities was also safely resolved amidst this victory.</p>
<p>The Course of the Battle</p>
<p>The twelve rounds are worthy of being described. In the first three rounds, it seemed that Joe Louis had the upper hand. Although Schmeling continued to counterattack, he was still at a disadvantage. From the fourth round onwards, Schmeling's eyes were injured, but he bravely attacked. Joe Louis fell to the ground at one point, but immediately jumped up to fight again. The audience's mentality changed greatly, and the shouts of cheering for Schmeling were unanimous throughout the venue. The fifth and sixth rounds saw Schmeling winning steadily amidst these cheers. In the seventh round, Joe Louis suddenly mustered his remaining courage to defeat his strong enemy. In the eighth round, he still had the momentum to attack, but then weakened again. From then on, he was unable to advance and could only parry. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh rounds were like being in a storm, barely managing to survive. At the beginning of the twelfth round, Joe Louis punched too low and received a warning. Suddenly, he was knocked to the ground and could not get up after counting to ten. The referee declared Schmeling the winner. The scene of the fifteen-round battle for the old championship ended here.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, 19th: The famous American black boxer Joe Louis and the German boxer Schmeling held a heavyweight title match of various levels. The original competition was for fifteen rounds. In the twelfth round, Schmeling knocked down Joe Louis and won the championship.</p>

Interbank bill transactions were even scarcer in the morning session, with only slightly over 1.9 million in transfers, and slightly over 500,000 in new transactions. Transactions in the noon session amounted to slightly over 300,000, and transactions in small exchanges amounted to slightly over 500,000. Foreign mortgage transactions saw only slightly over 300,000 in redemptions, with only slightly over 100,000 in new transactions. The amount of banknotes recovered was only slightly over 300,000 in marked bills. The amount issued was slightly over 800,000 in local bills, and slightly over 600,000 in out-of-town bills. The atmosphere in the financial world is that as the Dragon Boat Festival approaches, commercial firms are expediting the collection of festival accounts and are exceptionally busy. The amount of owed debt is likely to be substantial, leading to a general increase in activity, but there is little good news in terms of formal business. The amount received by money shops from foreign public receipts was slightly over 46 million, the amount received from foreign draft receipts was slightly over 3.9 million, and the amount of remittances from various routes was slightly over 400,000. As for the situation regarding the amount received by banks, the situation was rather bleak because yesterday was Saturday and foreign exchange transactions were routinely suspended in the afternoon. Foreign banks received slightly over 900,000 in note receipts, redeemed slightly over 800,000 in note receipts, received and redeemed slightly over 300,000 in foreign exchange, received slightly over 900,000 in goods, received slightly over 400,000 in mortgage receipts, received slightly over 800,000 in advance payments, redeemed slightly over 500,000 in miscellaneous receipts, settled slightly over 1.2 million, and received slightly over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers. Chinese banks received slightly over 1.2 million in note receipts, redeemed slightly over 900,000 in note receipts, received and redeemed slightly over 500,000 in foreign exchange, received slightly over 1.1 million in goods, suppressed slightly over 500,000 in mortgage receipts, received slightly over 900,000 in advance payments, redeemed slightly over 500,000 in miscellaneous receipts, redeemed slightly over 40 million in tax receipts, received slightly over 800,000 in telegraphic transfers, and settled slightly over 1.7 million in unsettled funds. Japanese banks received slightly over 1.89 million in note receipts, received slightly over 3.1 million in miscellaneous receipts, received slightly over 500,000 in telegraphic transfers, and settled and redeemed slightly over 900,000. The supplementary coin market suffered widespread losses, falling by one point, to only 11.8 cents. Therefore, the market exchange rate was only 10.43 or 10.44 cents. Transactions amounted to 55,000 cents, and copper coins remained at 302,000, equivalent to 3.200 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>Securities Market – Massive Selling by Bulls</h3>
<p>Government Bonds Plunge Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange fell sharply. The previous day's close saw significant buying to cover positions in No. 47 and others. Yesterday, news turned bad, and things went in the opposite direction. No. 47 and others quickly switched to selling. Although the current situation is unpredictable, many bulls on the market rushed to sell, and even major players turned bearish. Long positions for this month are particularly apprehensive. Next Monday is the last day for futures contracts for June. Types B and A saw the most deliveries of physical goods, so squeezing the longs will be more intense than other types. Fortunately, the bonds still include six months of interest, and the August listing will be after all interest has been paid, so prices are bound to be even lower. Yesterday, the market opened with news contradicting the previous day, and those who mistakenly entered the market engaged in unwinding positions. Old long positions gradually sold off, the opposite of the closing price of the previous day. No. 4 and No. 47 and others released large volumes, and market prices fell across the board, by 0.1 to 0.7 yuan. In the second session, No. 48 continued to buy, and although No. 47 continued to sell, most of the top stocks rebounded by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan. Types A and B remained flat. After the afternoon opening, more long positions emerged to sell, and even No. 11 rushed to sell. The market price returned downstream, down another 0.05, 0.1, or 0.35 yuan. At the close, No. 59 suddenly sold off a large volume, and No. 4 and No. 11 continued to sell, and the market price could not be maintained, leading to a short squeeze. Type A contracts for this month fell by as much as 0.6 yuan, and the rest also failed to rally. The environmental news has not yet turned around, and due to the weak surface, a short squeeze will be unavoidable. As a result, market prices fell uniformly from 0.3 to 1.5 yuan. The total number of transactions amounted to 97,700 yuan. The resulting rise and fall are compared in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton – Insufficient Delivery Contracts</h3>
<p>Near-Term Cotton Soars by Over One Yuan</p>
<p>—World Yarn and Cotton Prices Rising Steadily—</p>
<p>The cotton market is tight, and the upward trend is very strong. Due to the lack of delivery contracts for near-term old cotton, the short squeeze is very intense, and the market price has soared. The situation is extremely tense, and the general feeling is that floating shorts are losing their bearings. The July contract reached a high of 46.5 yuan, the highest price since April 14.</p>
<p>Old Cotton Breaks the 6 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, US cotton and old cotton surged, and Indian cotton was also tight. The Osaka Sanpin cotton contract for this month soared by 3.95 yuan due to the short squeeze, and short sellers lacked delivery contracts for this month, causing floating shorts to frantically cover their positions. The near-term contract jumped higher, and the opening momentum was very strong. As a result, prices for each month increased by 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, the contract for this month jumped another 0.3 yuan, while the far-month contracts remained flat. New cotton, on the other hand, tended to fall. The second and third sessions remained firm, but by the close, sellers were scarce for the June and July contracts, creating a fierce situation. The price broke through the 6 yuan barrier in one fell swoop. The July Bada contract was at 6.5 yuan, and the August contract had not yet broken through the 6 yuan barrier. As a result, old cotton prices rose by 0.2, 0.6, and 0.65 yuan compared to the morning closing price, while new cotton prices rose by 0.05 yuan or remained unchanged. Dafu sold 3,600 piculs, Tongji 3,100 piculs, Juxing 5,800 piculs, Ji 4,100 piculs, Chang 3,400 piculs, Yuan Yi 6,600 piculs, Taichang 2,400 piculs, Hengchang 2,600 piculs, Xincheng 4,200 piculs, Shenji 5,300 piculs, Changhe 1,700 piculs, Jifeng 5,800 piculs, Yuda 5,600 piculs, Run Kang 4,300 piculs, Sen Kang 6,000 piculs, Xinchang 4,000 piculs, and Fengtai 3,100 piculs. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Processing Continues at Japanese Factories</p>
<p>Consumption of spot cotton has decreased slightly, but demand from Japanese factories remains strong. The source is said to be 2,100 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Baohua 63.25 Public Factory entered 84 pieces Spot delivery to the factory</p>

<h3>The Price of Yarn Follows the Soaring Cost of Raw Cotton</h3>
<p>—Yarn Exchange Closed for Summer Solstice Holiday on the 23rd—</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, with the situation appearing strong and positive. The global cotton situation is single-mindedly trending upwards. At the same time, raw cotton prices are soaring, pulling the closely related yarn market into a favorable position. It's a pity that current yarn sales are too slow, and people's confidence isn't strong enough, so the rise is still relatively slow. However, with the price of cotton rising, the cost will increase, and the price of yarn should be able to stabilize.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Empty and Eager to Cover</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn market saw overseas cotton prices continue to rise, stirring up sentiment. The market was tight, sellers were scarce, and those who had sold short were eagerly covering their positions. At the same time, Osaka's Three Grades of Yarn also rose by one or two yuan. As a result, the prices of yarn for delivery in each month rose by one yuan to one yuan and 1238 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. However, yarn for delivery this month only rose by six jiao due to sellers delivering goods. The afternoon opening saw sluggish sales of spot yarn, and sentiment was mediocre. Prices for all months fell by five or six jiao. But later, given the extraordinary rise in cotton prices, the yarn market was pulled up, and by the third closing, it had recovered. As a result, the prices for all months rose by one, two, three, four, and five jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that 1,300 bales were sold by Tongji, 1,550 bales by Zhenda, 4,950 bales by Hexing, 1,400 bales by Fengtai, 1,500 bales by Shenji, 2,650 bales by Xincheng, 4,150 bales by Daji, 1,150 bales by Changyu, and 1,500 bales by Yongchang. 1,300 bales were bought by Jifeng, 1,200 bales by Meiji, 2,050 bales by Hengyi, 850 bales by Mingde, 2,300 bales by Gengfeng, 2,650 bales by Changfeng, 2,700 bales by Runkang, 1,050 bales by Tonghe, 1,150 bales by Yuda, and 1,200 bales by Dafeng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Weaken</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have slowed because the old lunar Dragon Boat Festival is approaching, and customer demand has diminished. It was found that a total of 725 bales were purchased by various firms throughout the day. In addition to the price increase of one yuan, the purchase amounts for various regions are as follows:</p>
<p>Inner Second District 85, Changsha 40, Shantou 20, Sichuan 100</p>
<p>Wuhu 25, Fellow Traders 150, Datong 5, Hankou 15</p>
<p>Ningbo 5, Tianjin Big 5, Jiangxi 5, Xiamen 10</p>
<p>American Cotton Spot Prices are Unusually Firm and High</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, traders' minds were unsettled, with prices for various months falling by one "bang yin" to rising four "bang yin". Trading in the market was concentrated in July contracts, and at 12.02 cents, cotton hoarding by the bulls had almost ended, while short sellers had not fully covered their positions, pushing the July price up to 12.0215 cents. Spot cotton is very tight, and whether cotton pledged as collateral will be resold is causing great anxiety. Other months also gained strength due to buying by brokers and sellers. There are fears that the October contracts will follow the same path as July, and some are advocating buying. Current demand is very high, and sellers are scarce. Maritime traders estimate that the mill's use is 220,000 bales and Liverpool's inventory is 300,000 bales. Before closing, slight profit-taking was absorbed. Spot prices rose by 23 "bang yin", and futures rose by 4 to 23 "bang yin". English cotton spot prices rose by six points, and futures rose by four to seven points. Indian cotton initially fell due to daily sales, but later strengthened due to short covering, public buying, and speculators buying July contracts. Pingguoer rose by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 0.75 to 1 rupee, and Ziroxi rose/fell by 0.25 to 0.75 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 19th):</p>
<p>Pingguoer 175.25, up 1.00, 31.0</p>
<p>December/January Contracts 153.50, up 0.75, 27.70</p>
<p>Aomula 205.00, up 1.00, 37.10</p>
<p>December/January Contracts 192.50, up 0.75, 35.10</p>
<p>White Ziroxi 303.50, up 0.25, 59.40</p>
<p>Fengyue Contracts 30.50, down 0.75, 08.20</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the purchase forecast for Ziroxi cotton on the 20th is 220 rupees per "luo", up 2 "bi" from the previous day.</p>
<p>Three Grades of Yarn See Short Squeeze in This Month's Contracts</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 20th, Three Grades of Yarn rose by 9 jiao to 2.3 yuan, with near-month contracts at 201.5 yuan and far-month contracts at 198.1 yuan. This month's cotton futures contracts surged 3.95 yuan to 69.5 yuan, with other months rising 4.5 to 8 jiao. January contracts were at 61.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - This Factory's Cloth is Gradually Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw a resurgence in the rise of yarn and cotton prices, and sentiment across the board became firmer. However, while actual sales have improved, the domestic sales channels are still weak, and most of the activity is still hoarding. Eastern goods and fine cloth have seen a decline in transactions due to excessive price increases. Most dyeing factories have absorbed cheap inventory. Dyed cloth has already risen by 1 or 2 jiao per bolt. The fine cloth and fine twill from this factory have not risen as much, so various firms have been stepping in to replenish their stocks. The exchange rate in Guangdong Province is still high, and Guangdong merchants' sentiments are mixed. Yesterday, several firms exclusively bought two or three hundred bales of fine twill from this factory, and merchants from Hubei also bought over one hundred bales, along with nearly ten boxes of colored crepe de chine, but the buying interest has not reached an ideal level, reportedly due to the agricultural busy season. Merchants from Fujian are not buying any Eastern goods such as fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, or 84 cloth, and are switching to goods from this factory. However, their demand is small, only for a few fine cloths and lower-grade yarn-dyed poplin and shilin cloth and bleached cloth. Merchants from Yantai and Qingdao in the North have started loading broadcloth, and Hua factory products are gradually rising in price. Large transactions continue to take place on this street. Interest in light-weight coarse cloth is also strong, and over three hundred bales were taken in yesterday. The price increase of fine cloth from this factory is more moderate than that of Eastern goods, and there is also quite a lot of buying. Merchants from Ningbo have a lack of interest in "yuan yang" yarn-dyed poplin, and only about twenty pieces were shipped yesterday.</p>
<p>Velvet Steadily Rising, Trend is Quite Good</p>
<p>Yesterday, Saturday (i.e., the 2nd day of the fifth lunar month), most of the woollen fabric businesses were preparing lists to collect debts, resulting in no formal transactions. But there were orders for spot goods like velvet from the Western clothing firms. First-grade goods were wholesaled for 4.75 yuan per yard, and second-grade goods for 4.3 yuan. The trend is quite good.</p>
<h3>Food - Demand From Flour Mills for Current Wheat Decreases</h3>
<p>Futures Wheat Initially Stable, Then Weak</p>
<p>Futures Flour Trading Halted Yesterday Due to Insufficient Margin Calls</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for all months showed signs of initial stability followed by weakness. Foreign wheat quotes showed Chicago up 1.23 yuan and Canada up 0.80 yuan. At the time of opening, the high prices of foreign wheat naturally stirred sentiment, but with the new wheat harvest just beginning, there was no significant impact. Therefore, the opening prices for near-term contracts were unchanged, and far-term contracts only improved by two or three fen. Trading was quite active across all boards. However, when the market opened in the afternoon, sentiment suddenly turned flat and weak because the demand from flour mills for current wheat was not as strong as in the previous few days. There were also reports that orders from outside the region had been halted, which immediately dampened sentiment. Prices for all months fell by three fen. It is expected that if there is a surge in arrivals of the new crop, the market will look weak. The spot wheat market was generally calm, and opening prices were similar to the previous day. Opening prices: old wheat 4.6 yuan, Mingguang pipe wheat from Huai'an 4.45 yuan, Liuhe wheat 4.4 yuan, Wuhu wheat 4.35 yuan, Gaoyou wheat 4.43 yuan, Danyang wheat 4.27 yuan, Yangzhou wheat 4.38 yuan, Nanjing wheat 4.28 yuan, Xieshi wheat 4.06 yuan, Pudong Jiading wheat 3.62 yuan, Anting wheat 4.02 or 3.98 yuan, Kunshan wheat 4.145 yuan, Jiaozhi wheat 4.18 yuan, Bacheng wheat 4.15 yuan, Shuangfeng wheat 4.1 yuan or 4.0 yuan, Suzhou wheat 4.18 yuan. Fufeng sold 7,000 bags, Fuxin sold 1,000 bags, and Shenda sold 700 bags.</p>
<p>The flour exchange was closed yesterday because margin calls for June had not been fully collected, so trading could not proceed as usual. It is said that trading will not resume until Monday of next week.</p>
<h3>The Rising Trend of Soybean Cake and Oil is Suppressed</h3>
<p>Spot Soybean Cake Trading is Especially Active</p>
<p>The price of standard soybean oil and cake rose in unison because prices from various producing areas were reported to be rising. The telegram from Dalian showed prices rising several times a day, which made buyers very active. In Dalian, due to large purchases by Germany and Japan, and with the signing of the German agreement, further shipments are expected. Sentiment in the local area is bullish, and speculators are even more active. In general, people believe that prices will only rise and not fall until the new crop comes on the market. Due to the rising prices in Dalian, buying in the Shanghai market was particularly strong, and even non-industry large firms were speculating, making the market even more lively. Yesterday, the price of standard oil soared by 5 or 6 jiao, and the price of standard cake rose by 5 or 6 fen. The price of carload soybeans also rose by nearly a jiao.</p>
<p>The spot soybean cake market has been sluggish for a long time. Sales of Liangshan soybean cake have been suppressed by the low price of fertilizer powder, and the high prices after summer have been abnormal compared to previous years. Generally, merchants' sentiments were not very excited. Yesterday, due to the daily rise in shipping prices in Dalian, sentiment in Shanghai was stimulated, and trading suddenly became active. Prices rose by three or four fen. 17,000 pieces of Four Brands cake were traded with various factories. It was also agreed to open a large shipment of over 15,000 pieces of Four Brands cake to be delivered in the first half of July. 4,000 pieces of Shaguo cake were shipped by ship. Please refer to the price column for various prices.</p>
<h3>Transactions of Local Indica Rice are Active on This Street</h3>
<p>Yesterday, arrivals of local indica rice were limited. Only rice from Jiangxi had some volume. Other ports lacked whole shipments. Although outbound sales were not very smooth, business on this street was extremely active yesterday. Merchants from the interior and Ningbo were also purchasing lower-grade rice. Therefore, trading was brisk, and prices rose slightly. If demand for local rice from Hunan and Guangxi continues to be strong, prices may need to be adjusted upwards again in the future. Total sales for the day were 6,320 bags of Jiangxi rice, 859 bags of Hunan rice, 252 bags of Wuhu rice, 190 bags of Taiwanese rice, and 300 bags of Jiangbei rice. Prices were similar to the previous market, but prices were slightly adjusted upwards.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Rise by a Fraction of a Dollar</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of goods from various firms were particularly scarce, with only a total of twelve numbers arriving, totaling 2,450 shi. Therefore, although retail and wholesale sales were normal, sentiment was quite firm, and the market continued to show strength. The price of thick japonica and early rice increased by one fen to nearly a jiao, and the price of thin rice increased by five fen. The price of Du Yangjian was also firm.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-two or twenty-three numbers arrived from various routes along the river. Various goods in the market continued to be sold. Because prices in the producing areas were high, customers were calling for higher prices. The market price of white japonica rice increased by several fen to one jiao. Thin rice was firm. The price of "yin" rice was particularly firm. The price of white "yuan" rice increased by nearly a jiao. Yangjian's position was stable. The arrival of Du Ke Liao rice was scarce, and prices were firm. Prices of all other goods were firm.</p>
<h3>Seafood - Squid Not Yet Available, Seaweed Sells Well</h3>
<p>Squid, new products from warm waters. In previous years, they would be available on the market in late June. This year, the weather is too cold, and ocean growth is delayed, so the first batches of goods have not yet arrived. According to reports from Hakodate, Japan, new goods will not be available until the middle of next month. Sales of old goods on the market are quite active. The street's inventory is gradually decreasing, and sellers are gradually calling for higher prices. Currently, Xiangguan Qiushui goods are selling for 88 yuan, slightly oily goods for 86 yuan, whole oily sliced goods for 78 yuan, and Jinshan bucket goods for 75 yuan. Unless there is a surge of petal goods, there is no chance of prices falling.</p>
<p>Seaweed. Because the summer season is approaching, demand from various regions is frequent. Recently, customer demand has been particularly strong. Although there are arrivals, they are still not meeting demand. Therefore, prices in the producing areas and this city have risen in unison. Yesterday, the market price of the best grade of Tianzi brand was 345 yuan, the price of medium-grade Qing brand was 335 yuan, the price of gold brand was 326 yuan, and the price of Guanchua brand from China was 310 yuan, which is 20 yuan higher than the market price ten days ago. The speed of the price increase is unexpected, and the situation is firm. There is a possibility of further price increases in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - The Silk Market Depends on the Yokohama Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices rebounded slightly. The price of New York white factory B grade 78, 20.22 denier, recently sold for $1.555 for spot goods and $1.505 for futures, up half a cent to one and a half cents from the previous day. The price of Yokohama raw silk rose by 20 yuan to 690 yuan, and the price of goods for later delivery rose by 13 yuan to 700 yuan. Domestic and foreign transactions in the Shanghai silk market were both few and far between. If Yokohama silk prices can continue to improve next week, the Shanghai silk market may become more active.</p>
<h3>Tunxi Zhenmei Tea Sales to Europe are Still Good</h3>
<p>Since the Tunxi Zhenmei silk tea market declined at the beginning of the week, the market has been reactivating. Yesterday, overall sales of Tunxi Zhenmei were not strong. However, since a large number of telegrams have been sent, the Zhenmei tea has been purchased again by the Mailong, Liuyu and other firms for over four hundred "dun" at a price of 70 yuan, which is two yuan lower than the previous day. Zhenzhen is still arriving in steady stream. Xiehe selectively purchased at a price of 70 yuan, but only 80 boxes were traded. The remaining local Zhenmei was bid by Xiehe at 55 or 56 yuan, but because the cost of each tea was high, no one was willing to sell, so trading was also rare. For Pingshui Zhucai tea, the telegram previously sent by Yihe was relayed yesterday to continue purchasing about 1,000 boxes at a price of 54 or 55 yuan. Huacha Tianyu also made slight purchases, and the market was relatively stable. The black tea market was also stable. Yihe and Baochang and other firms continued to search for goods, and Tianyu Foreign Firm also began to purchase goods. Therefore, sentiment was firm, and market prices did not fluctuate much. Total sales of black and green tea throughout the city were over 6,700 boxes, and the situation was relatively stable.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Frequent Decline in Golden Needle Vegetables in North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Sluggish Sales in Guangdong Province... New Goods are Approaching</p>
<p>The price of golden needle vegetables has been declining frequently. The main reason is that sales of this product mainly depend on the Guangdong, Shantou and other regions. Since the disturbances occurred in Guangdong and Guangxi, the exchange rate in Guangdong and Shantou has been tight, making it difficult to agree on prices, and those who are in this business do not dare to purchase much. Therefore, sales are sluggish, and the market has declined significantly. Secondly, new goods are approaching the market, and there is also hope for a bumper harvest, so most firms are eager to sell early. As a result, prices have been falling sharply, leading to the unexpected low prices now. Yesterday's market price for upper-grade goods was 17 or 18 yuan, and the price for lower grades ranged from 12, 13 or 14 yuan. Compared to the highest price this year, the decline is almost half. If sales improve in the future, there may be a small rebound after a large drop.</p>

<p>Children's Special</p>
<h3>Start Today!</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chengxi</p>
<p>When we do things, we must think of doing it, "starting today". If we wait for tomorrow and then the day after tomorrow, we will not accomplish anything good in our lives. Repeatedly delaying will only result in "failure".</p>
<p>We must know that procrastination and laziness are the most venomous snakes. To get rid of a bad habit or cultivate a new habit, we must have unwavering determination; otherwise, we will never succeed. If we have thoughts like "Let's do it one more time today, and I'll stop tomorrow!" or "I'll do it well starting tomorrow, let's just play today!", then bad habits will never be eliminated, and new habits will never be established. We must have the determination to "start today." Don't think that there's always tomorrow!</p>
<p>The ancients said, "The past is like yesterday's death, the future is like today's birth." Things that we believe are improper and should not be done, we will immediately stop doing them starting today. Things that are proper and should be done, we will start doing them today.</p>
<p>Children! We are the future masters of the country. If we don't cultivate ourselves well from a young age, how can we save the country from danger and advance the great wheel of the era in the future?</p>
<p>Everyone, remember: "Start today!"</p>
<h3>Italian Children Undergo Anti-Gas Training</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has always paid close attention to the military training of young people. Since last year, he has also organized the "Sons of the Wolf" group. Although Italy has recently defeated Albania and intends to annex it into Italian territory, given the increasing turbulence in Europe, he is also paying close attention to national defense issues, especially air defense.</p>
<p>Amidst the air defense efforts, Italian children are also receiving various types of training. Recently, members of the "Sons of the Wolf" group can often be seen marching in formation on the streets of Rome. Each person wears a gas mask. At an emergency order, they will quickly put the mask on their heads, covering their entire face.</p>
<p>The "Sons of the Wolf" group was created by Mussolini. Membership is limited to children between the ages of six and eight. From the age of eight to fourteen, they can join the "Young Fascist" group. After joining the "Sons of the Wolf" group, the children wear black Fascist uniforms and undergo strict military training. They currently carry wooden guns, but they will be replaced with real guns in the future. In short, the current "Sons of the Wolf" group will be Italy's most powerful army in a decade.</p>
<h3>How to Prepare for the Exam</h3>
<p>— Linghu Zhao</p>
<p>Children, time flies like an arrow, and another semester is coming to an end. And the thing you are most worried about is the "exam". The "exam" cannot be avoided; otherwise, you will have to repeat the grade and cannot advance to the next level, which is so shameful!</p>
<p>If you have paid some attention to your studies usually, you don't have to worry about the "exam". Otherwise, you will have to cram at the last minute. Especially math, if you haven't done many exercises usually, you need to do some now. Choose the important ones to do, you don't have to do them all because of time constraints. You should also read and memorize history and geography. For Chinese, it is enough to read your own compositions and newspapers. For English, you need to read more new words and simple sentences. This way, you won't end up in "complete failure"!</p>
<p>Now is the best time to study. It gets light very early, so we can get up earlier and take two books and a notebook, whether in the living room, on the balcony, or in the countryside, anywhere with fresh air. At least you can read for two or three hours. At this time, memory is the strongest, and the rate of reading is also faster. The ancients said, "The plan for a day is made in the morning," which is the same principle.</p>
<p>However, in the one or two days before the "exam", you should not read too much; you should just review briefly. Otherwise, you will confuse your brain, and you won't be able to answer the questions during the "exam".</p>
<p>It is getting hotter every day, so we should be especially careful with our diet. It is best to eat less cold things like sour plum soup and ice cream. It would be very difficult if you fall ill during the "exam," so you must pay attention to hygiene in the summer.</p>
<p>During the exam, don't be anxious. First, listen quietly to the teacher's instructions, and then start answering the questions. Do the questions that you can do first, and leave the ones that you can't do for later. After you have done the whole paper, then do the questions that you couldn't do! Otherwise, time will not allow it, and you will end up in a "terrible mess"! Be careful!</p>
<h3>A Lump of Mud</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>One day, Ming'er's father was planting a flower, so he asked Ming'er to be his assistant and move soil. After the flower was planted, Ming'er asked his father, "Please, what is the relationship between flowers and soil?"</p>
<p>Ming'er's father said, "Why don't you soak a small lump of mud in a glass bottle, and I'll tell you tomorrow, okay?"</p>
<p>The next day, the father and son went to look at the mud in the bottle. The mud had clearly separated into layers of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Ming'er's father pointed at the bottle and said to Ming'er, "The coarse particles at the bottom are called gravel. The finer ones above are called sand."</p>
<p>Before his father finished speaking, Ming'er interjected, "Then, what is the use of gravel and sand for planting flowers?"</p>
<p>Ming'er's father said, "Listen to me finish before you ask. Isn't there also something sticky on top of the sand? That's called clay. The thinnest layer on top of the clay is called humus. Humus is formed by the decomposition of plant leaves and roots."</p>
<p>Ming'er said, "Then what about clay?"</p>
<p>Ming'er's father said, "Plants are like animals; they need to eat every day to grow. Clay contains minerals, which plants love the most. As for sand, it doesn't contain any mineral food."</p>
<p>Ming'er suddenly understood and said, "The textbook says that plants don't grow in desert areas. I guess that's the reason. This sand is really annoying!"</p>
<p>Ming'er's father said, "You can't say that sand is definitely annoying because all cultivable soil contains sand. It is good for the soil to contain sand: it can loosen the soil and make it easier to absorb water, which is useful for planting."</p>
<p>Ming'er was very happy after listening to his father and said, "Tomorrow I will take this bottle of mud to school and tell my classmates about it so that they can gain some knowledge."</p>
<h3>Dad is Unemployed</h3>
<p>— Naichang</p>
<p>Although Yuan'er is only eight years old, he is tall, strong, and capable, so he has become a small leader in the group of children.</p>
<p>However, when we met him this afternoon, he was no longer as energetic as usual, and the smile on his face had disappeared. We all ran up to him, some pulling his hand and some patting his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Ah Yuan, what's wrong? Why are you looking so sad?" someone asked him.</p>
<p>"Nothing! Nothing!" he shook his head.</p>
<p>"Why don't you tell us? You said we're friends! We'll definitely help you if we can."</p>
<p>Yuan'er then mumbled, "Dad is unemployed!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the children were all stunned and speechless.</p>
<p>After that, we couldn't go to school with Yuan'er anymore. Yuan'er helps his mother at home every day. Soon after, he ran to the streets to sell evening newspapers. But we respect Yuan'er even more than before. He is a useful citizen of the future, a citizen with an independent spirit.</p>

<h3>Why Doesn't Charlie Chaplin Speak?</h3>
<p>— Ziying</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times" has already been released. Everyone who has seen this film must have one question: "Why doesn't Charlie Chaplin speak?"</p>
<p>Yes, Charlie Chaplin has never spoken on the screen. Why? Let me tell you a story:</p>
<p>When Charlie Chaplin was only a teenager, he was lucky enough to be hired by a vaudeville troupe to perform in Jersey, one of the Channel Islands. Because the islanders mostly didn't understand English, they were even more confused by the funny jokes and country slang. As a result, their comedic performances were completely unintelligible, leading to business failure. Later, after much discussion and research, they tried to use gestures and movements to make the audience understand their meaning. This led him to discover a great secret—the power of mime.</p>
<p>After becoming famous, he often said, "Humans use gestures (movements) to express everything, which can make people understand more deeply than sounds." He also said, "Mime and silent films are the languages of the world."</p>
<p>That's how he has insisted on continuing until now, never speaking on the screen. We should not laugh at Charlie Chaplin as a clown. His artistic theories are also worth our attention.</p>
<h3>Organizing Newspaper Reading Groups</h3>
<p>— Fei Jiexin</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A scholar doesn't step outside his door, yet knows the affairs of the world." How does a scholar know the affairs of the world? It is because he reads newspapers.</p>
<p>Newspapers not only provide news of national and international military, political, and economic affairs, but also record various new discoveries and common knowledge of the world every day. Day by day, they give readers a new perspective and new knowledge. They not only inspire people's feelings of patriotism, love for the people, and love for humanity, but also guide people onto the bright and broad path. They can also cultivate morality and develop thought, making them essential reading for literate people.</p>
<p>I remember when I was little, I wrote a strip of paper that said, "One cannot go a day without eating, and one cannot go a day without reading a newspaper," and pasted it on my desk as my motto to encourage myself to read newspapers.</p>
<p>When you first pick up a newspaper, you really don't understand much. But if you read it for ten days, you will gain experience, and then it will become easier and more interesting day by day, like an "opium" addiction, impossible to quit.</p>
<p>Now I have a suggestion: I hope that the children in school will organize newspaper reading groups. The number of people in each group is not limited. Each group should elect a leader to manage all the affairs of the group, and invite a teacher to be an advisor to guide everything. All members of the group must read the *Shen Bao* every day. (The time and amount do not have to be limited.) Every day in the afternoon, choose a suitable time outside of class to meet together, and the advisor will designate someone to report. (The number of people designated does not need to be too many, and the time should be about ten minutes.) And evaluate the performance of each group's report for comparison.</p>
<p>This method of designated reporting can make each member take responsibility for the "newspaper reading task." At the same time, after listening to each other's reports, the students will unconsciously exchange knowledge, using what others know to make up for their own deficiencies. It's truly "killing two birds with one stone," so why not do it!</p>
<p>If a member of the group has not read the newspaper, everyone can make an agreement to penalize them to read it and report it the next day.</p>
<p>This kind of organization is very interesting, children may wish to try it!</p>
<h3>Rooster</h3>
<p>— Kang</p>
<p>Old rooster! Old rooster!</p>
<p>You crow every day at dawn, waking us up early.</p>
<p>Telling us: "Be smart, be clever; don't be greedy for sleep, don't get up late.</p>
<p>Absorb the good air in the morning, and appropriate exercise is also suitable. Working and studying—often twice the result with half the effort; friends—don't miss the good opportunity!"</p>
<p>Ah! Respectable and lovely rooster!</p>
<p>Thank you for your kindness, crowing diligently every morning, tirelessly and on time.</p>
<p>May you work to the end, urging us to make progress!</p>
<h3>A Small Boat Made of Pea Pods</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhiwen</p>
<p>I remember when I was little, every year in March and April, when the broad beans planted in the fields were ripe, my younger brother and I would carry bamboo baskets to pick them. When we brought them back, we would peel the pods and make a few small boats to play with in the small river, letting them float on the water, looking just like the ferries on the Huangpu River. Children who grow up in the city probably wouldn't know about this; but the method is very simple, now let me tell you.</p>
<p>Now is the time for broad bean pods, when you see your mother or the maid peeling broad bean pods, you pick a few neat ones, and carefully peel them open, (as shown in Figure A) and take out the beans; then take a few broken matchsticks and prop them inside the pod, (as shown in Figure B) three for each one, the front and back ones are the same length, and the middle one should be longer. As for how to make the awning, it's even simpler, just cut out a square piece of drawing paper and prop it on both sides of the pod, (as shown in Figure C) and you've made a very interesting little boat.</p>
<p>Scientific Little Questions</p>
<h3>How Can Tooth Powder and Toothpaste Clean Teeth?</h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>Anyone who understands some basic hygiene knowledge, whether adult or child, probably has the habit of brushing their teeth every day. But who knows that brushing teeth with tooth powder and toothpaste can make teeth clean? We know that the outermost layer of teeth is enamel, which is very hard and is used to protect teeth. However, although enamel is very hard, it is also afraid of one thing, that is, acidic things. People are naturally bound to eat some things, like the acid in fruits, the acidity that milk gradually turns into after eating, etc., so we must think of a way to get rid of that kind of thing left in the crevices of our teeth after eating. Of course, rinsing your mouth is also an option, but to rinse it completely clean is really not an easy task, so the best way is to use an ingredient with the opposite alkaline nature. Tooth powder and toothpaste have this kind of thing, so with the action of the toothbrush, the dirt in the crevices of the teeth can be removed. Therefore, children, if you want to keep your teeth clean, you must develop the habit of brushing your teeth every day; and to brush your teeth every day, you must use tooth powder and toothpaste to be effective.</p>

<h3>Wooden Sticks and Bamboo Poles</h3>
<p>—Reply to Zhang Jiaren of Peizheng Middle School, Guangzhou—</p>
<p>Dear Jiaren:</p>
<p>"Must the stick in the Boy Scout's hand be made of wood?" Your question is indeed very interesting. We strongly advocate that the stick in the hands of Chinese Boy Scouts should be changed to bamboo poles. Because "bamboo" is a specialty of our China. And it is more powerful than the current wooden sticks. For example, when building bridges, bamboo poles are much more practical than wooden sticks.</p>
<p>Even that old brother Baden-Powell, who initiated the World Boy Scout Movement, also mentioned this question—when he saw the several brothers who went to Denmark last time to attend the World Boy Scout Jamboree, he asked: "Why don't you Chinese Boy Scouts use bamboo poles as sticks?"</p>
<p>Probably because our several "imitating" Boy Scouts in the past—imitating the foreign big brothers, before they even knew the use of that wooden stick, just "copied exactly" the way people took wooden sticks. As you know, this stick in the hand of a Boy Scout is by no means a decoration, nor is it a substitute for the rifle in the soldier's hand, we are going to use it to do a lot of "detective" work.</p>
<p>You say you want to use other materials, then we fully agree, we agree that you should change to bamboo poles. We hope that all Chinese Boy Scouts will change to bamboo poles—because that is a cheap and practical thing.</p>
<p>If, because of habitual relationships, it is inconvenient to change immediately—especially in group life, because of the need for uniformity, it is not easy to change. Then we hope that you yourself, at least in your personal outdoor life, will replace that wooden stick with this bamboo pole, a Chinese specialty.</p>
<p>Regarding the many facts about Chinese "bamboo," I hope you will look it up in the "Bamboo Family" in the botanical dictionary, or ask the older brothers who understand "bamboo." We would also like to get a photo of you using a bamboo pole in outdoor life. Is it possible? I won't write much more, I wish you "growing higher step by step" like a bamboo pole—progress!</p>
<p>Respectfully replied by the China Boy Scout Self-Help Society</p>

<h3>The Tale of a Righteous Dog (23)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Little Nello struggled to stand up, hugged Patrasche with both hands, and murmured, "Everything is over! Dear Patrasche! Everything is over!"</p>
<p>He was so hungry that he had no strength left in his body, but he still勉forced himself to cheer up and walk back to the village. Patrasche walked by his side dejectedly, his powerful limbs weakened by hunger and worry.</p>
<p>The snow was falling heavily, and a gust of cold wind, like a sharp knife, blew from the north, and the plain was as silent as death. It took him a lot of time to find the familiar path, and by the time he groped near the village, it was already four o'clock. Patrasche suddenly smelled a scent in the snow, immediately stopped, pawed incessantly, and fetched a small brown leather bag from the snowdrift. He raised his head in the darkness and handed the bag to Little Nello. He saw a lamp hanging under a small cross nearby, and when he held the bag to the light, he saw the name Kogets on it, and when he opened it, he saw banknotes worth six thousand francs.</p>
<p>Little Nello was very surprised to see so much money. He quickly stuffed it into his shirt pocket, patted Patrasche's head, and pulled him forward. Patrasche looked at him with a puzzled look on his face.</p>
<p>At that moment, Little Nello went straight to the mill, all the way to the front of the residence of the miller Kogets, and knocked on the door. Mrs. Kogets opened the door crying. Little Alois followed behind her, and she said with tears in her eyes, "Poor child, does your father know you? You hurry up and run away, don't let my husband see you. We are having a troublesome affair tonight, because he dropped a money bag when he came back riding a horse just now, and he is now going out to look for it, but where can he find it in the snow? God knows that we are going bankrupt after losing so much money. This is because we treated you badly, and we are receiving such retribution."</p>
<p>Little Nello put the money bag in her hand, and sent Patrasche into the house. He then hurriedly said, "This money bag was found by Patrasche tonight. Madam, please tell Mr. Kogets this, and ask him to keep Patrasche, it is too old. Please provide it with food and shelter. Please treat it well, and don't let it out to chase me when I leave."</p>
<p>Mrs. Kogets had no time to say anything, Little Nello bent down and kissed Patrasche, and then hurriedly closed the door and slipped away in the dim twilight.</p>

<h3>The Balkan Peninsula Today</h3>
<p>— Zuo Bin</p>
<p>The Balkans was originally the center of contention among European powers, and the origin of the Great War; it has always been known as the "International Volcano." After the war, although the situation in the peninsula has changed somewhat, its international relations have become more complex and serious. Therefore, it is still one of the main powder kegs in the world today.</p>
<p>The countries on the Balkan Peninsula today include Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, and Albania. In addition, part of Turkey's territory is also on the peninsula. These countries have deep relations with European powers, so the conflicts of European powers on this peninsula are particularly serious and complex. For example, the conflict between Britain and Italy in Greece, the struggle between France and Italy in the Little Entente and the contradiction between Austria-Hungary, and the triangular contradiction between Germany, France, and Italy on the peninsula can all be said to be very serious and irreconcilable. Recently, because of Poland's diplomatic activities among the Little Entente countries, German Economic Minister Schacht's lobbying in Southeastern Europe, and the diplomatic exchanges between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, especially the development of the Austrian restoration movement, this "International Volcano" has become even more fiery.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the activities of Germany and Poland. Originally, the Little Entente countries were always in line with France. Recently, due to the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Pact and the pro-Soviet stance of Czechoslovakia and Romania, it has become a member of the Franco-Soviet bloc. Needless to say, this is very displeasing to Germany and Poland. In addition to sending troops to the Rhineland to respond to this matter, Hitler is also trying to lobby the Balkans in an attempt to divide the Little Entente countries. The concrete manifestation of this matter is first of all Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, lobbying Yugoslavia recently. Because although Yugoslavia is a member of the Little Entente, it has no major conflict of interest with Germany, and it is more likely to be close to Poland. The problem is that Germany and Poland are now working hard to win over Hungary, while the contradiction between Hungary and Yugoslavia is very deep. So the main task of Colonel Beck's lobbying is to reconcile the contradiction between Yugoslavia and Hungary, so that they both join the German-Polish bloc to oppose the Franco-Soviet bloc. The other is the recent visit of the German Economic Minister to Southeastern Europe. It is said that the task of his trip is to try to revise the barter agreements established between Germany and Yugoslavia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Greece, and other countries, and to establish an economic bloc in Southeastern Europe, so that the various agricultural countries can establish close trade relations with Germany; apart from this, there is no other political significance. However, economics and politics are inseparable. Once Germany's economic relationship with the Balkan Peninsula becomes close, certain countries on the peninsula will inevitably become politically closer to it. In fact, just as Schacht was lobbying Yugoslavia, there was a rumor that the famous German arms factory Krupp would transport a large number of arms to the Balkans. Is it not deceitful to say that Schacht's trip has no political significance? Judging from the current situation, Germany's attempt is to go through Poland to win over Hungary and Yugoslavia; if this attempt becomes a reality, it can not only disintegrate the alliance between Italy, Austria, and Hungary, but also force Austria to move closer to Germany; it can also divide the Little Entente bloc, so as to weaken or even eliminate the power of France and Italy in the Balkans and in the Danube region. However, this attempt will be strongly resisted by France and Italy, and even Czechoslovakia and Romania. As for what the future result will be, it will depend on the development of the contradictions among the European powers.</p>
<p>As for the other incident, the Austrian restoration movement supported by Italy, it is even more serious than the previous problem. Because the rulers of the original Austro-Hungarian Empire were the Habsburg royal family; after the Austro-Hungarian Empire disintegrated after the war, and the Habsburg dynasty collapsed, its land was taken away by Romania and Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia was entirely composed of the old territories of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; if the Habsburg royal family succeeds in its restoration, Austria-Hungary will inevitably raise the issue of recovering lost territories, which will threaten the existence of the Little Entente; therefore, the Little Entente must oppose the Austrian restoration with all its might. We can say that the formation of the Little Entente was to prevent the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. In fact, in the mutual agreements of the Little Entente countries, there are specific provisions for preventing the restoration of the Habsburg royal family. However, Austria, given its national conditions, has only two paths to take: one is to merge with Germany, and the other is to implement restoration and rebuild the Austro-Hungarian Empire; as for Hungary, it also hopes to restore the prosperity of the Habsburg dynasty era and recover the lost territories. Recently, because Germany tore up the Locarno Pact, and Hungary has actions that violated the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and the Treaty of Trianon, this has already caused unease among the Little Entente countries; as for the development of the Austrian restoration movement that followed, it will of course be strongly opposed by them.</p>
<p>In fact, when the Austrian-Hungarian Prime Minister was active in Rome, and the rumors of the Habsburg royal family's restoration were raging, the heads of the Little Entente countries held a meeting in the Romanian capital, deciding to continue to abide by the policy announced on August 5 of last year; the content of that policy was: "1. Oppose the restoration of the Habsburg royal family; 2. If anyone attempts to modify the current borders of the Danube region, the three Little Entente countries will resolutely deal with it with force." The seriousness of the problem can be seen here.</p>
<p>However, Austria-Hungary, under the control of Italy, is moving towards the road to restoration; the close relationship between the Austrian royalists and the Austrian authorities has been expressed in an open form, and Rome has already prepared a concrete plan for the Austrian restoration. The rumors are spreading, and the Habsburg dynasty is about to be restored soon. If the Habsburg dynasty restoration event is launched, not only will the Little Entente countries use force to oppose it, but also Germany and France, for the sake of their rights in the Danube region and in the Balkans, will make effective protests; the result will inevitably be that the Second World War will break out again from the Balkans, from the Danube region. Mussolini also knows the seriousness of this problem, so he is currently trying to mediate the contradiction between Germany and Austria, attempting to win over Germany in order to realize the restoration of the Habsburg royal family, so that the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula can all be controlled by Roman forces. But Hitler's answer to this fellow traveler is that Germany does not approve of the Austrian restoration; as for his attitude towards the Balkan and even the entire European problem, he will have to see the results of the staff meeting of the Little Entente countries that is currently underway and how the relationship between Britain and Italy develops before he can decide. In this way, the solution to the problem becomes even more difficult.</p>
<p>In summary, the first force in the Balkans today is undoubtedly the Little Entente group with the Czech Republic. This group wants to maintain the status quo. The second is Italy's power in Greece and Albania; Mussolini is currently working hard to promote the restoration of Austria, so that his power in Central Europe and the Balkans can be connected into one piece. There is also Germany, although it does not yet have a large basic power in the Balkans, Hitler is working hard to unite Yugoslavia and Bulgaria; and further unite with Poland and Hungary to form a group force to enter and exit the Balkans. In addition, there is Britain's power in Greece; this is of great importance to its maintenance of its rights in the Mediterranean. All these forces, all these development directions of these forces, are mutually conflicting. Among these conflicts, the problem that deserves special attention at present is the above-mentioned German-Polish activities in the Balkans and the Little Entente's preparation to use force to oppose the restoration of the Habsburg family. The development of these two events is very likely to change the situation in the Balkan Peninsula and trigger the outbreak of a world war.</p>
<p>Recently, the Balkan Entente Four-Nation Intelligence Conference was held in Bucharest, the capital of Romania. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu gave such a speech: "What we seek is only to protect our own interests, and we are unwilling to be driven by anyone. We are willing to get along with European powers such as Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Russia without distinction, and we are willing to provide concrete evidence to show our sincerity in getting along with people peacefully. Although the principle that all countries have equal status is a matter of course, it is by no means what we are willing to give up; and any decision that concerns us but has not obtained our consent in advance cannot be accepted. Looking from Ankara (the capital of Turkey) in the east to Prague (the capital of the Czech Republic) in the west, there are no less than seven million people who are vigorously defending peace! We sincerely love peace, but we are by no means blind pacifists. In today's world, if we want to maintain peace, the best way is to prepare for war, this is what we deeply believe." Although it is full of the word "peace," the result is "preparing for war"; using "preparing for war" to maintain peace, the meaning of "peace" is no different from war. The Balkans today, and even the whole of Europe and the world, are full of war crises disguised under the words of "peace"; and the Romanian Foreign Minister's speech is precisely a manifestation of this meaning.</p>
<h3>Temple Monk Yearns for the World</h3>
<p>— Shi Huiming</p>
<p>Now, when I think back on my unique life of over ten years, even I am bewildered. Why did I live such a life? Is such a life reasonable?</p>
<p>Other people's "eating vegetarian food and worshipping Buddha" is because they cannot bear the "torment" of this world and want to ascend to "heaven," seeking a "next life." Some are because they are weary of the material life of wine, women, wealth, and desire and want to change to a simple taste, enjoying a little "mountain forest pleasure." Some want to live forever, permanently maintaining the glory and wealth of "this life." But what about me? My learning of Buddhism is purely out of exploring philosophy, wanting to find an ultimate in the world, to unearth the "true meaning" of life. However, after so many years of "cultivation," I have never obtained many solid "verifications." As for "achieving Buddhahood" and "realizing true reality," it goes without saying that it is still far off and uncertain. Therefore, I cannot help but deeply feel weary and doubtful about my current and past Buddhist life, which occupies half of my life. This may naturally be due to my reading some "heretical" books other than Buddhist books, resulting in some "prejudice" and "delusion," but the main reason is still that I cannot obtain an "ultimate" from "asceticism."</p>
<p>I remember when I was studying in middle school, due to the harsh family environment and the poor school education, coupled with the old and pedantic academic thoughts at that time (around the tenth year of the Republic of China), any young person who was willing to use their mind was not very satisfied with real life. I was one of those young people. I was only fourteen years old at that time. At that time, there were many Chinese language teachers in middle school who "meditated" and "entered the Tao." In addition to teaching students a few ancient prose pieces, they asked us to read "The Great Learning's" "investigation of things, extension of knowledge, sincerity of will, and rectification of the heart," "in manifesting one's clear virtue," and "The Doctrine of the Mean's" "attaining equilibrium and harmony." Further, they taught us Wang Yangming's "Quotations," learning to "extend innate knowledge," and even further, they taught us to read "Liao Fan's Four Lessons" and "The Treatise on Actions and Retributions." The result was lecturing us on Buddhist books and reading "A Commentary on the Treatise on the Establishment of Consciousness-Only." In such edification, we unconsciously gradually felt that the world has an ultimate, but this requires us to explore it. Afterwards, we also knew that it was not enough to work hard only on books and that we would never gain "liberation," so we inevitably reached the path of learning Buddhism. This was the beginning of learning Buddhism from Buddhist studies, and this was also a major stage in my entire life.</p>
<p>Through the introduction of several teachers, I formally "entered the Tao" at the nearby Bishan Temple. The situation at that time was like this: Bishan Temple was holding a "Water and Land Dharma Assembly," saving all the "lonely ghosts" from far and near, seeking blessings for the local area. There were seventy or eighty "sutra chanters," and the duration was forty-nine days. The head of the teaching was named Chen, and he was very famous in the nearby</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>several counties. From the county magistrate and gentry to the farmers and laborers, many went to "pay their respects," and his "disciples" numbered no less than three thousand. This Water and Land Dharma Assembly was personally presided over by Teacher Chen. Through the introduction of several "introducers," my name was filled in on a yellow paper list, and the introducer presented it to the "teacher" (i.e., the head teacher). After the teacher reviewed it, it was approved. The first time, I knew that one of my friends was rejected because of his "deep karmic sins from a previous life." After the introducer repeatedly pleaded, and we knelt on the stone slab in front of the "master's" dais and wept, after two hours, we finally obtained the master's forgiveness, who was willing to "forward our request."</p>
<p>In a room that was closed on all sides, with no one allowed inside, nearly twenty "initiated" disciples knelt on the stone slab, surrounded by more than a dozen of our senior brothers, and above us sat our Teacher Chen. The room was as dark as night, and the ground was a hard and cold stone slab. Apart from the humming sound of chanting sutras in the adjacent "sutra hall" and the sound of tapping the "wooden fish," the entire temple was silent, with only the occasional sound of wind in the mountains hitting the paper windows from the valleys and trees. The master formally spoke, and we all held our breaths to listen. The first section talked about how sinful and miserable life is, the second section said that all learning has no ultimate, and the third section mentioned the profundity of Buddhism. He also quoted scriptures and classics to prove and explain this. But this was all explaining from the academic perspective why one should learn Buddhism. Secondly, he talked about the way to liberation, that is, how to learn Buddhism. He said that we should "not separate from this in our walking, staying, sitting, and lying down." That is to say, we should always remember and think about this point. But before he said what "this" was, he asked us to swear one by one, telling us not to tell the "secret" he taught us to the "mortals" who had not yet been initiated, not even our parents, otherwise we would be "watched by the gods." After we took the oath, the master said what "this" was. He said, "You must always remember and think about a 'sky in the water' and a 'moon in the water' in your heart at all times. What is the sky in the water? It is to think that there is a vast and boundless water under our feet, and there is a bright moon at the bottom of the water, as if you see it with your own eyes. Just this point, be sure to close your eyes and recite it silently at all times, and soon there will be a reason." The so-called "this" is this. We only got this from the teacher. At that time, we began to always think about the sky in the water and the moon in the water. In less than a few days, there were actually "signs," and at any time, there seemed to be a bright moon actually appearing in front of us. We asked the senior brothers, and they also said: "You must work hard to cultivate, your talents are high, and it is easy to see results."</p>
<p>After "entering the door," progress was very rapid, and I was full of the belief that I had found the right path in life and obtained the "expedient Dharma door," so I simply stopped reading books and only followed the master to study and practice. I was also a sutra chanter in the Water and Land Assembly. Generally, disciples who have just entered the fray must go through the stage of "sutra chanter." Naturally, among the sutra chanters, there are also many children from poor families who rely on chanting sutras to eat and get "incense money" to support their families; there are also those who come to "recite sutras" to save their own family's "departed souls." But most of them belong to the initial work of us disciples who have entered the door, which is to temper your "mortal heart" as a "layman." Get up at seven in the morning, wash, and then enter the "sutra hall." The sutra hall is divided into "Yellow Altar," "Inner Altar," "Outer Altar," and "Lonely Soul Altar." The first sutra I went to recite was the "Dissolving Grievances Sutra" at the Lonely Soul Altar. Reciting it once is called "one scroll." For short sutras, you can recite seven or eight scrolls in each "session" (that is, the time from entering to exiting, when people change shifts), and for long sutras, you must recite at least one scroll in each session. Sutras like the "Dissolving Grievances Sutra" can be recited two or three scrolls in each session, depending on how familiar you are with the recitation. Knocking on the wooden fish with one hand, you must keep making sounds from your mouth. When entering the altar, you must naturally face the god's seat, and when leaving the altar, you must also face the god's seat, that is to say, you must come out backwards. When starting the sutra, you must chant the opening verse together, and when the sutra is finished, you must sing the closing verse together. Every time for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, hundreds of monks and laypeople must kneel in front of the gods together, and the sutra chanters "bow" and play music, which is called "worshipping." Every seven days, you must get up at dawn when the rooster crows to "offer to the heavens." The first seven days I recited the "Dissolving Grievances Sutra" at the Lonely Soul Altar, the second seven days I went to the Inner Altar to recite the "Revolving Heaven and Earth Sutra," and the third seven days I was promoted to the Yellow Altar to recite the "Diamond Sutra." The Diamond Sutra is the most difficult sutra to recite, and it is full of transliterations translated from Indian, such as "Tad yathā: oṃ gate gate pāragate pārasaṃgate bodhi svāhā," which does not require thinking or understanding at all, but only uses sound. Even if you recite dozens of scrolls, you cannot remember it. This is the best thing to temper the mortal heart. During the day, you recite the sutras, and at night, you silently recite it "without separating from this." This is how my Buddhist life began.</p>
<p>After the Water and Land Dharma Assembly closed, I abandoned my family and parents and followed the master to his "Taoist Temple" to "cultivate." In addition to complying with all the "precepts" of the teacher, I also had to do chores, just like sweeping the floor and getting cigarettes and pouring tea when I was an apprentice. The work in the temple was sweeping the floor and "burning incense." Hundreds of "gods and Buddhas" had to be burned incense and bowed to every morning and evening, which was quite troublesome. In the meditation room, there were rows of futons, and the room was also dark and gloomy. Each person sat on a futon, and everyone was silent. There were six hours of "Zen meditation" every day, but diligent disciples could sit all day except for eating. The teacher naturally also had to "meditate," but he was in his own "forbidden room," and disciples were not allowed to enter without instruction. Most of the disciples only "meditated" and did not read much. Some were of shallow understanding and could not understand books, and some could read books, but they always followed the teacher's words, "more cultivation and less thinking," "knowledge learned by remembering is not as good as purifying the heart and reducing desires." Even if they read books, it was nothing more than the precepts of Buddhism, and at most it was only the "Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana." The profound classics, such as the "Perfection of Wisdom Sutra," "Avatamsaka Sutra," and "Consciousness-Only Treatise," were probably rarely asked about by anyone. Only I was different from them. On the one hand, I sat firmly, but on the other hand, I also liked to read the sutras and treatises of various schools, and I knew which school we belonged to, and what other schools there were. I also often discussed with senior brothers and the teacher, studying who was right and who was wrong, but in the end, they did not have a solid answer.</p>
<p>Nearly three years have passed since I began learning "without separating from this," but apart from the "fire energy" (state) of that bright moon appearing in front of my eyes, I could not see anything else. Some people did not pursue it much, but I was not like that. I wanted to ask the teacher for a further state. He said, "A tall building rises from the ground," so it is better to work hard "without separating from this." He also said that he had been learning for more than forty years, and now he can barely "ascend" and meet with the gods and Buddhas. He told us to cultivate for another forty years before talking about it. I could not find any "expedient methods" in the Buddhist books of various schools, but I also believed that "there is a reason in this." Sometimes, in the wind, morning, and moon evening, when there was no sound of people, sitting alone on my "meditation bed," I could not help but stir up some mundane thoughts, and I also thought of the human life of "sound, color, goods, and profit." Sometimes, I also doubted the vastness and remoteness of the Western Paradise. However, in such an environment, it was impossible to jump out and seek another path.</p>
<p>After a few years of "temple residence" life and a few years of "layman's life," my "spiritual power" has not improved, and because the times have changed, I have also read a few new magazines and books from friends, which made me doubt the path of learning Buddhism. My current life and behavior are also not as loyal and rigid as they were ten years ago, and I do not trust the Buddha as much. I think I will eventually "return to secular life" and return to "mortal heretics."</p>

<h3>Introduction to "From Elementary School to Junior High School"</h3>
<p>— Yuan Jun</p>
<p>——Written by Qian Fugong, Ge Shixiong, and Shen Jiameng, published by the China Children's Literature and Art Society near Banfang, Penglai Road——</p>
<p>The lack of universal education in our country is a well-known fact. In other countries, a middle school student is only at the beginning of their studies, and it does not seem to be valued much, but in our country, illiteracy accounts for more than 80% of the population, and there are so few citizens who can receive compulsory education. A child who has the opportunity to graduate from elementary school and enter junior high school is truly a "favored child of heaven." According to a previous survey by the China Vocational Education Society, there were a total of 118,598 students in public and community middle schools across the country, while the total population of the country was estimated to be 450 million. The ratio is "1 to 4,000." Among the Chinese people, only one in 4,000 is a middle school student. How worthy of our treasure and love are these middle school students selected from 4,000 people? Therefore, from the perspective of our country's special circumstances, we have infinite hopes for the present and future of middle school students.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, middle school education is the backbone of education. Although the foundation is important, the backbone cannot be ignored. A student who has just graduated from elementary school is at a time of significant development in their physiology and psychology, and it is also a time of transition from childhood to adolescence. In the stage of education, they have reached a very dangerous period. If they are not given appropriate, reasonable, and perfect guidance and are led astray, not only will their bodies be destroyed as a result, but also the happiness of their entire lives may be sacrificed as a result. A student who has graduated from elementary school, because they have a better family, because they have more enlightened parents, and can get the opportunity to enter school, is a very difficult thing, but if they fail at the last moment, and this small number of outstanding talents still cannot be used to their full potential, it would be such a pity. Therefore, from this point of view, students from elementary school to junior high school need reasonable guidance, which should not be delayed.</p>
<p>For the child themselves, after graduating from elementary school, their parents and older siblings give them the opportunity to enter school, and their psychology is filled with infinite trepidation. Although the entrance exam is an unfamiliar thing, there are many more unfamiliar things! Because after entering school, they have changed to a new environment, people and places are very unfamiliar, and their work is clueless, just like a woman who is just married. A woman who is used to living in her original family will inevitably feel infinite trepidation when she is asked to live in another family. They are hoping that someone will give them good guidance, telling them how to live in the new environment, just like a young lady who is about to marry hopes that her mother can tell her how to live after marriage.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether from the general situation, from the special situation of our country, or from the child's own point of view, students from elementary school to junior high school urgently need reasonable guidance.</p>
<p>From elementary school to junior high school is a large bridge in the stage of life, and it is a connecting raft in the stage of education. As for how to cross this bridge and how to use this raft, in the past, although teachers have done their due diligence in providing guidance, "parting words" are always difficult to express in full, and it is inevitable to miss something. What can make up for this regret is only the book "From Elementary School to Junior High School," recently published by the China Children's Literature and Art Society and written by Qian Fugong, Ge Shixiong, and Shen Jiameng. It systematically and scientifically assumes the important task of guiding students "from elementary school to junior high school."</p>
<p>Mr. Qian, Ge, and Shen have all served as deans of elementary and middle schools for many years. Based on their rich educational experience, combined with the latest educational principles and the actual educational environment, they have written this book of nearly 50,000 words, which is truly the crystallization of their hard work. The book begins with a preface by Mr. Pan Gongzhan, who says: "From elementary school to junior high school is an important stage of schooling. General life and the learning of various subjects should have specific guidance. This book is a product that meets this need. It is a guidebook for elementary school graduates and junior high school students, and it is also a reference book for teachers and parents."</p>
<p>The book is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter is titled "From Elementary School to Junior High School." This is a special chapter to guide elementary school graduates on how to live in middle school, sincerely inducing them to cultivate the spirit of self-government and self-discipline. Indeed, most junior high school students have to study in other places. Even if parents love their children, they cannot directly provide education and upbringing. What can be directly responsible for is only relying on the teachers in the school. However, middle school teachers, precisely because junior high school students are no longer children, have great differences in the guidance of life and the supervision of academics compared with elementary schools. This is not because middle school teachers cannot be as responsible as elementary school teachers, but because junior high school students should have the spirit of self-government and self-discipline. There are many students who had good bodies, academics, and character in elementary school, but once they get to junior high school, they weaken their bodies, ruin their studies, and spoil their character. Isn't living in school the same in elementary school and middle school? But why do such different results occur? This is because of the lack of self-government and self-discipline. This chapter's argument is insightful, its elaboration is thorough, and the writing is fully capable of touching children's hearts. The second chapter is titled "A Healthy Junior High School Student." Based on our country's educational goals, it analyzes the conditions that a healthy junior high school student should have: first, to train a healthy body; second, to possess civic morality; third, to understand national culture; fourth, to enrich life knowledge and skills; fifth, to cultivate a scientific foundation; sixth, to develop labor habits; seventh, to be rich in artistic interests. It is comprehensive and its words are novel, and it does not fall into the old tune. The third chapter is titled "Telling You Several Important Principles of Learning," divided into seven subsections (recognizing the goal of learning, determining the determination of learning, understanding the scope of learning, three necessary learning mentalities, several methods to increase interest in learning, four excellent learning habits, several necessary learning spirits). Standing on the position of educational psychology, it is described in simple words, and the author has put in a lot of hard work. The fourth chapter is titled "Indicating You Some Methods of Reading." Starting from the relationship between learning and reading, it goes on to talk about the environment for reading, the tools for reading, and the relationship between memory and reading. Everything is down-to-earth, and it summarizes and tells you many practical methods of reading. The fifth chapter is titled "What to Learn in Junior High School." The learning goals of junior high school subjects such as civics, physical education, hygiene, Chinese, English, arithmetic, botany, zoology, chemistry, physics, history, geography, labor, music, and drawing are thoroughly analyzed. This is of great help to students' learning. Because the motivation for learning must be in the source of need, the interest in learning will increase, and the efficiency of learning will be significant. Otherwise, it will be like a blind man riding a blind horse, mechanical learning, meaningless learning, which will definitely fail. The sixth chapter is titled "Learning Several Important Subjects." This chapter is entirely a guide to practical methods, with detailed instructions for Chinese, composition, English, arithmetic, natural science, and social science. The seventh chapter is "How to Absorb New Knowledge." The methods of reading newspapers, reading magazines, and how to use libraries are explained very clearly. Only by absorbing new knowledge in such a multi-faceted way can one avoid becoming just a bookworm or a slave to textbooks.</p>
<h3>Introduction to "A New Theory of Esperanto"</h3>
<p>— Nie Feng</p>
<p>——Written by Xu Mo, published by Xinzhi Bookstore, actual price 25 cents——</p>
<p>Today, when culture, technology, science...everything is rapidly internationalizing, the "international language" is no longer just a beautiful fantasy of poets, but an urgent requirement of real life. Esperanto is the most successful of many international languages that have emerged to meet the needs of the public.</p>
<p>Esperanto has been in China for almost thirty years. During this long period, especially in the last three or four years, the influence it has had among young people in general has reached a very broad and profound degree. But on the other hand, the Chinese Esperanto movement also has an undeniable shortcoming, namely that theory often lags behind practice. Originally, in terms of quantity, the domestic publications introducing and studying Esperanto are not few, but there are not many that have deep observations and accurate analyses of this issue. Most are either biased in favor or biased against, and have never touched the core of the issue. Therefore, in the past, people in general often did not get a correct understanding of Esperanto.</p>
<p>This shortcoming was not completely eliminated until the publication of this book "A New Theory of Esperanto."</p>
<p>The author of this book is himself a practitioner of the Esperanto movement, so he has a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of this issue. This is the most fundamental reason for the many advantages of this book. In detail, the reason why it can surpass many similar works in the past is mainly due to the following three points.</p>
<p>The first is the correct methodology. The basic theory of this book starts from the materialist Jef linguistic theory. When dealing with the history, grammatical structure, technology, and movement issues of Esperanto, it never forgets to link them with the fundamental factors of real society—economic, political, and cultural development—and grasp these issues from a dynamic point of view; it not only analyzes the past and present of Esperanto, but also logically predicts its future. Only in this book can we find the most reasonable answer to the question of the relationship between Esperanto and national languages.</p>
<p>Regarding the structure of language, this book points out from its morphology and etymology the "purely agglutinative language characteristics" of Esperanto, thus explaining the true source of the simplicity of Esperanto, which has always been misunderstood. This is even more the author's unique insight.</p>
<p>The second is the abundance of materials. Although this book is not much in volume, it mentions all aspects of Esperanto concisely and fully, such as: the historical opportunity for the emergence of Esperanto, the activity of Esperanto in practice, the position and role of Esperanto in the process of language evolution, the struggle and differentiation of the Esperanto movement, and the reflection of the rise and fall of various forces in real society on the Esperanto movement, etc. The last two chapters, "Basic Grammar" and "Comparative Readings," analyze the composition of Esperanto in detail, which is of great help to those who are interested in learning Esperanto.</p>
<p>The third is the accessibility of the writing. Popularization is a necessary bridge for all modern knowledge to reach the general public. This book is a model in this regard. When reading this book, it is like listening to an old friend's long conversation, rather than feeling like reading a book. The redundant terms and stiff sentences often found in general theoretical books cannot be found in this book. Anyone who has learned a little Chinese can read it in one breath without any effort.</p>
<p>For the more vigorous growth of the language of this new era, I am happy to introduce this introductory book to every young friend who is thirsty for modern knowledge and modern language!</p>

<h3>Domestic Paper Umbrellas</h3>
<p>— Outline</p>
<p>These days, summer has arrived, and we can see many modern young women on the streets every day, holding small paper umbrellas to resist the scorching sun or heavy rain. These umbrellas are made of materials that are translucent in appearance and vividly colored. According to the reporter's investigation, this is entirely a domestic handmade product. Its main raw materials are eight kinds: paper, oil, persimmon lacquer, paste, hair string, hemp thread, bamboo, and wood, which can be described as follows:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about paper: The durability of each paper umbrella depends entirely on the quality of the paper. There are many types of paper used by umbrella shops, but the best is mostly white mulberry bark paper because it is fine, tough, smooth, and self-cleaning. When made into paper umbrellas, the color is clean, transparent, and durable in the hot sun. The medium grade mostly uses inferior thin mulberry bark paper, or semi-sized paper and yellow-green paper. This kind of paper is slightly rough, less tough, and slightly gray-yellow in color, making it less durable after production. Inferior paper uses Yuanbai Lian and other papers, which are the roughest and least tough, and become hard, brittle, and easily broken after being exposed to the sun. As for paper umbrellas for export, most use Jinging paper.</p>
<p>Second is oil: The oil used for paper umbrellas is only tung oil and green oil. The best quality comes from Sichuan and Yunnan. Tung oil is thick, and green oil is thin. It is not suitable to use them alone. Therefore, umbrella shops often mix equal amounts of the two types of oil and then apply them to the paper umbrellas. Recently, because many buyers of paper umbrellas dislike the smell of tung oil, umbrella shops have reduced the proportion of tung oil, usually mixing tung oil to account for two or three tenths, and green oil to account for seven or eight tenths.</p>
<p>The persimmon lacquer in the raw materials is extracted from a type of persimmon fruit. It is clear gray in color and thick, and very sticky. When applied to paper, it immediately changes color. After drying, it can resist water for a long time when immersed in water.</p>
<p>As for the paste on the paper umbrella, it should not be too thick or too thin. If the paste is too thick, the umbrella surface will be hard and not soft; if it is too thin, it will easily fall off over time. Therefore, the best ratio of wheat flour to water when making paste is one part wheat flour to nine parts water, cooked until half-cooked, and then stirred with a small stick. Wait for it to cool before use. Hair string: Human hair is washed to remove oil and dried, then made into hair string by female workers. The finer and more uniform the better. It is strong and unbroken, and will not rot for a long time on dry or wet ground. Hemp thread: White hemp is best. Umbrella shops mostly buy ready-made ones from hemp thread stores, not making them themselves. The ribs and pole of the paper umbrella are made of bamboo strips. Bamboo with long sections, thick flesh, and straight strips is best for making the ribs. If wood is used for the umbrella head and handle, strong and tough jujube or chestnut wood is suitable. The craftsmanship and quality of paper umbrella manufacturing vary, but the manufacturing methods are roughly the same. That is, making the umbrella ribs: First, take whole Mao bamboo, cut it into sections, with lengths of one foot four inches, one foot five inches, one foot seven inches, one foot nine inches, two feet two inches, two feet four inches to six inches, etc., and then split the sections into thin strips, one and a half fen wide and less than one fen thick. The middle section of this thin strip is left with a raised area when cutting, two and a half or three fen long: use a foot-operated toothed turntable to dig a concave groove on the front of the raised area, about one fen deep; then drill a small hole on the side of the raised area to thread hair string for binding. One end of the entire length of the thin strip is shaved into a bead shape, and the other end is shaved flat, with a small hole drilled in the side, also to thread hair string. This is the method of making long umbrella ribs. If the Mao bamboo is cut into sections seven inches, seven and a half inches, eight and a half inches, nine and a half inches, one foot one inch, one foot two inches six, etc. long, with a width of two fen and a thickness of one fen, both ends are shaved flat, and a small hole is drilled on each side. This is for short umbrella ribs. When long and short umbrella ribs are joined together, a long rib of one foot four inches is matched with a short rib of seven inches, and so on for the others. One long and one short rib matched together are called a set of paper umbrellas. Each umbrella has a different number of sets, but ordinary paper umbrellas have at least thirty-six sets and at most fifty-four sets as the standard. Making the umbrella head: The raw material for the umbrella head is usually bamboo or wood. Fine ones use cow horn or copper. Each umbrella has two umbrella heads, inner and outer, which are round and hollow. The outer umbrella head is squared off and a concave groove is sawed into a gear shape with a foot-operated toothed disc. A small hole is drilled on the side of each protruding tooth, one for connecting the long ribs and one for connecting the short ribs. Threading the hair string: To connect the long and short umbrella ribs and the umbrella head, take a hair string and first thread it through the hole at one end of the long rib, then thread the hair string through the hole in the protruding tooth of the umbrella head, threading each one in the same way. Then pull the hair string to embed one end of each long umbrella rib into the concave groove of the umbrella head, tie a knot, and cut off the remaining hair string: Next, take another hair string and thread it through the short umbrella ribs in the same way. Align the other umbrella head with the long and short umbrella ribs, embed one end of the short rib into the raised area in the middle section of the long rib, and use the hair string to pass through the small hole on the side of the raised area in sequence so that the long and short umbrella ribs do not separate. After this, when the umbrella ribs are closed, the angle between the long and short ribs is small, and they are almost parallel. When released, the long and short ribs form an obtuse angle of one hundred and twenty degrees. The outer end of the long ribs is then fastened with hemp thread or cotton thread, encircling it once or several times, so that the distance between the long ribs is the same, the angles are equal, and there is no movement.</p>
<p>Pasting the paper is an important task in making paper umbrellas. First, cut the mulberry bark paper into isosceles triangles with angles equal to the space between the long and short ribs, then open the umbrella ribs that have been threaded with hair string, and apply persimmon lacquer or paste to the long umbrella ribs. At the same time, paste the equal amount of triangular paper onto the umbrella ribs. This is the first step. Then, apply persimmon lacquer or paste all over the paper, and after pasting the triangular paper, brush it with a hair brush to make the paper adhere firmly to each other. This is the second step. For the second step, wait for the persimmon lacquer or paste to dry, then cut a round piece of paper with a diameter of about one foot two inches, dig a small hole in the center, put it on the umbrella top, and apply persimmon lacquer or paste around the umbrella top. Then, carefully brush it with a hair brush. Add paper twice in the same way and let it dry, which is the blank umbrella. Paper umbrellas coated with persimmon lacquer turn brownish yellow, and those coated with paste turn white. In terms of firmness, paste is not as good as persimmon lacquer. However, paper umbrellas decorated with flowers, birds, landscapes, and figures currently do not use paste because its color is not bright and beautiful. More advanced ones use Bletilla striata juice as glue, so the appearance is transparent and it can replace paste.</p>
<p>As for painting, it is divided into two types: one is to paint first and then apply oil, and the other is to apply oil first and then paint. Painting first and then applying oil is further divided into two types: one is printed patterns; the other is hand-painted flowers. Those who apply oil first and then paint all use hand-painted painting, and there have not been any improvements in printing. The pigments usually used are cinnabar for red, malachite green for green, indigo for blue, and massicot for yellow. If you want to apply mixed colors, first mix cinnabar, indigo, and massicot, and then mix them with tung and green mixed oil.</p>
<p>Finally, install the umbrella pole and handle: The umbrella poles are mostly round, and the handles are square or round, or made into various styles. Those that should be painted are painted, and those that should be oiled are oiled. The length of the umbrella pole is generally about five inches to one foot longer than the umbrella ribs, and the handle is about two inches to five inches long. The installation method is to pass the umbrella pole through the hole in the lower umbrella head, and fix it firmly with small nails to prevent it from falling off, and install a springy piston in the middle section of the umbrella pole.</p>
<p>In the past, there were as many as three or four hundred paper umbrella workshops in this city. In the early years of the Republic of China, the import of parasols increased day by day, and many Chinese also abandoned the paper umbrella industry and set up factories to manufacture parasols themselves. After the May Ninth Movement, the resistance to enemy goods revived the paper umbrella industry and the domestic parasol industry to some extent, but they were later hit by the sale of inferior goods. After the May Thirtieth Movement, until the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the call for promoting domestic goods was very loud, and ladies were happy to use paper umbrellas because they had been greatly improved, so they appeared quite active. However, because merchants from other cities such as Fuzhou and Hangzhou mostly concentrated in Shanghai, the sales of local manufacturers became narrower. According to a recent survey, there are less than a hundred paper umbrella workshops, and most of them have switched to using kraft paper or also operate oilcloth umbrellas.</p>
<p>Domestic paper umbrellas are very popular among Europeans and Americans, and annual exports have reached more than three million umbrellas at the peak (including paper umbrellas from various places concentrated in Shanghai), but due to foreign imitation over the years, sales have gradually decreased. Recently, it is said that only four or five hundred thousand umbrellas are exported each year.</p>

<h3>The Jews in Palestine</h3>
<p>— Bochang</p>
<p>Correspondence from Jerusalem</p>
<p>Palestine was originally the old homeland of the Jews. Before the war, it was a territory of Turkey, and after the war, it became a mandated territory of the British. Due to its geographical location, this place is very important to British imperialism in protecting the security of the Suez Canal and controlling the land traffic between Asia and Africa. But there are two ethnic groups in this place, namely Arabs and Jews; they were originally ruled and oppressed by British imperialism. From the standpoint of their own liberation, they should unite to resist the British; however, because there is conflict between the two, disputes often occur; and British imperialism uses their contradictions to maintain its rule in this place. Recently, the conflict between Arabs and Jews in this place has become increasingly serious, and the order of the holy land of Jerusalem has become a chaotic state that is difficult to maintain; but the general situation of their conflict is reported in the newspapers every day, and there is no need for us to elaborate; what we want to report here is the general situation of the Jews here, hoping to help to understand the national issue of Palestine.</p>
<p>Originally, the Jews in Palestine accounted for only one-eighth of the total population, but recently, because they have worked hard to attract overseas compatriots to return to the country in order to revive it, and Britain also wants to use the capital of Jewish merchants from all over the world to develop and prosper this ancient country of Palestine, the number and power of Jews here are now much greater than in the past; of course, on the other hand, the lives of Arabs have felt a great threat.</p>
<p>Although the Jews do not have our homeland now, generally speaking, many Jewish merchants have a lot of capital and are good at managing businesses; under their continuous investment and hard work, this ancient country of Palestine has indeed shown an increasingly prosperous phenomenon. The first thing that attracts our attention is their achievements in developing wasteland: in the past, it could almost be said to be a desert, but now it has become an orchard with green leaves; the tangerines are world-famous. Originally, the old production areas of tangerines were mainly Spain, Italy, Brazil, and North America, etc., but because of the development of the fruit tree business by the Jews here, they have occupied an important position in the world consumption markets in London, Paris, etc. in recent years, and have shown great competitive power for the above-mentioned old tangerine production areas. According to reports, there are currently millions of new tangerine trees here, so it goes without saying that there will be a greater threat to other tangerine competing countries.</p>
<p>At the same time, the general agriculture here under the development of the Jews is also very advanced. They use the latest methods to divert river water to irrigate the land, and skillfully drain the salt from the soil to increase the agricultural area and harvest. In the rural areas here, there are almost modern agricultural product processing factories everywhere; the electric wires are like spider webs, extending in all directions, which is very convenient, and general transportation is of course developing day by day; compared with the past Palestine, it can really be said to be another world.</p>
<p>In this way, the natural result is the development of general industry and commerce, the increase in foreign trade statistics, and the prosperity of the market in this ancient country in recent years. This situation can be clearly seen in the increase in the number of immigrants to this place. According to local statistics, the total number of immigrants to this place in 1933 was 30,327, of which 250 people owned more than 1,000 pounds of capital; the total number in 1934 was 42,359, and those with more than 1,000 pounds of capital were 5,124; the total number in the first half of last year also exceeded that of 1933, reaching 30,474. The performance of such figures is undoubtedly of greater significance in the current economic downturn.</p>
<p>Among the newly added population in Palestine, the main ones are of course the Jews returning to their country. Therefore, the above-mentioned increase in immigrants to this place not only shows the prosperity of this place, but also shows the development of the Jewish restoration movement and the increase in their power in this place. In fact, many department stores and industrial and commercial groups have been newly added in Jerusalem and other cities in recent years, and most of these are mainly composed of Jews.</p>
<p>However, in the prosperity of this ancient country, there are two major contradictions: one is the conflict of interest between the Jews and Arabs mentioned above, and the other is the conflict between Britain and the Jews. It is very obvious that the important purpose of the return of Jews from all over the world to Palestine is to rebuild their own homeland, and to make this old Jewish homeland independent from Britain and become their own country; but the intention of British imperialism is to use Jewish capital to prosper its colony, as for the Jewish restoration movement, it will of course actually prevent it. At present, British imperialism is working hard to provoke conflicts between Jews and Arabs in order to prevent them from uniting in the liberation movement; moreover, after this struggle between the two ethnic groups, the relationship between them is undoubtedly further deteriorated, which can of course be said to be a great achievement of British imperialist policy. However, at the same time, due to the lessons of facts, the enlightened Arabs and Jews here have gradually realized that their main enemy is British imperialism, and they must unite to fight to the death with this main enemy in order to seek liberation. In fact, the conflict between some Arabs and Jews here has begun to turn to the struggle against Britain; at the same time, some Jews have actually had many anti-British expressions; the most conscious among them are hoping that the two small nations will unite and resist the common enemy, British imperialism, in order to seek everyone's true liberation.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Times</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>"He who understands the times is a great man" is a saying that you can often hear in general officialdom, in the world of officialdom, and in the sitting and chatting of pedantic gentlemen over tea. Originally, the simple meaning of this sentence is to say that as long as a person can see the objective current affairs clearly and understand them, then he is a hero. Indeed, it is very difficult for a person to be able to understand the ins and outs, the truth, and the changing trends of all the large and small current affairs that appear before his eyes, and to take appropriate adaptation strategies according to its current situation and trends, and to be able to not go against its movement, but to follow it in practice. It is indeed worthy of being a hero if he can really do this, and can make a career.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, not to mention how understanding the times is not easily understood by ordinary people, even the meaning of the sentence "He who understands the times is a great man" itself has correct and incorrect and different levels of understanding. We know that in the general vulgar people's understanding of the sentence "He who understands the times is a great man," it is often from the point of view of personal self-interest, even with a very narrow and short-sighted perspective. The so-called understanding of the times by them is not to teach a person how to see clearly the various social meanings of the current situation and its complicated social relations, to see clearly how each situation arises based on these complex social relations, and how it is related to all aspects of the entire social mechanism, etc.; nor is it to teach people to see clearly the overall situation of society and the inevitable laws of common development, let alone to teach people how to stand on the feet of social and public interests to recognize the value of a certain situation, to adopt appropriate activities to adapt to its needs for the benefit of society, etc.; especially it is impossible to learn from the perspective of social development and evolution, to recognize the more far-reaching inevitable trend in the historical process implied and contained in the current situation of society, to recognize the times and the trend, to stand on the position of progress to adapt to the progressive development of society, and to promote social progress. They are only teaching people to pursue current personal practical interests, to become pursuers of private interests in all realistic situations, and tailismists who follow the tail of events. Because they are only chasing the events that have already become reality, they very short-sightedly believe that only what is expressed in front of our eyes is worth paying attention to and should be grasped, and is true and beneficial. This is just as Hegel said, viewing "everything that is real is reasonable." And because they only stand on the position of personal self-interest to understand the times, their evaluation and grasp of the realistic situation only looks at whether it is consistent with their own interests. If it is beneficial to oneself, then this matter is meaningful and worth doing, otherwise it is meaningless and should not be done. They think that only doing things by looking at the wind is considered understanding the times, otherwise it is considered not understanding the times, or even being pedantic. Moreover, the general so-called understanding of the times also has the meaning of looking at power and looking at how the social trend of custom is and chasing this trend. Because they are not in the business of demanding to recognize whether something should be done or not, but only in looking at whether the general custom of the world praises or opposes this thing. If everyone is doing that, then I should also do this, which is considered a great man who understands the times. Such a so-called understanding of the times can only be regarded as climbing the bandwagon and following the crowd. Such a person emphasizes personal self-interest and forgets the responsibility of transforming society, and is a person without the ability to be independent and unique. How can he be considered a person who understands the times or a great man? But there are many people in society who understand the meaning of understanding the times and practice it in this way. They are constantly only paying attention to the rise and fall of social forces. If a certain force has increased in proportion in society, they will fall to that side and echo it. Conversely, if the objective situation changes and another force rises to replace it, they will change their body again and fall to this side, and also echo it. They always only attempt to stand on the side of power, always only want to cleverly take care of their own practical interests so that they do not fall into emptiness and suffer damage, and at any time become those who soar to prominence, become people with power and influence. If someone says that he has no firm stance and integrity, then he says that he is a tactful and resourceful person, a great man who understands the times. They not only think of themselves as great men who understand the times, but also often use the words "He who understands the times is a great man" to persuade people to speculate and take advantage, calling those who are pure and self-respecting and unwilling to climb the bandwagon pedantic and not understanding the times. Therefore, in the past history, there were often those who were unwilling to be mixed with the world in turbidity and seek prominence, and were accused of being unreasonable and not understanding the times. Today's society is of course even more so.</p>
<p>So how can one be considered a great man who understands the times? This clearly says that anyone who is a far-sighted and brilliant person, as long as he can see the true essence of social phenomena, can know everything about the overall situation of all affairs and society, and know the inevitable laws of its evolution and change. Therefore, he can see the past and future roads of social and historical evolution, see the times and the trend of the times, and predict its future development. This is a person who can understand the times. And his actions are based on his knowledge as the basis, he has grasped the certain trend of social evolution, can not be blinded and tempted by temporary phenomena, so he can firm his own position, can maintain his own integrity. He also does not care about temporary failure and success, does not count temporary gains and losses, labor and honor and disgrace, but always actively transforms society and promotes society for the welfare of the people and for the interests of society, while putting his own personal interests out of consideration. This can be considered a great man, and can be considered a great man who understands the times. Understanding the times is inseparable from practice. Not only must one be able to correctly recognize the objective world in order to be considered understanding the times, but also must be able to correctly practice it in order to be considered a great man, and only then can one truly understand the times. Therefore, those who do not understand the times are certainly not considered great men, and those who can only understand the times but cannot practice it are also not considered great men. A great man is produced from knowledge and practice. A great man understands the times and correctly practices according to the times he knows. The two are inseparable.</p>
<p>As for how a person can understand the times, this is also not a very simple matter. From what we have said above about how to be called a person who understands the times, then he must have very keen vision, and this vision must be based on his learning. Because if he does not have the vision to analyze objective events and recognize the inevitable laws of social evolution, he will not be able to recognize the current reality and will not be able to understand the times. But to be able to recognize the objective, he must have knowledge of various scientific philosophies, especially knowledge of social sciences, and even more particularly, he must have sufficient political and economic knowledge. Not only that, in order to be a correct person who understands the times, he must be able to see clearly the trend of the times and the trend of social evolution. In this way, not only must he have knowledge, but he must also have the latest knowledge that is considered in that era, and have new knowledge that stands in front of the advancing era, in order to be possible. Because he does not have the latest weapons and tools, he cannot recognize new events. If you call those well-learned gentlemen who have old knowledge and talk about the sayings of Master Cheng Zi to understand the current affairs, he must be completely ignorant. Therefore, if you want to be a great man who understands the times, in our society, he must first learn the most advanced and newest philosophy, social sciences and other basic knowledge. The determination is that understanding the times also depends on us having a pure and upright mind, and having a firm stand and integrity. Because only in this way can we not be concerned about personal self-interest, so that it will obscure our own objective and pure knowing ability, otherwise we will not understand the times. Of course, the nature of such a person is not innate, but must be cultivated from knowledge and practice, but in any case this nature is always indispensable. Finally, the necessity of practice, because the ability to practice can more clearly recognize the objective, and the ability to practice is considered a great man, we have already said.</p>

<h3>Diary from the Back Building (II)</h3>
<p>— Shu Yu</p>
<p>September 14th</p>
<p>Busy with moving all day, I only have time to write in my diary now that everyone in the house is asleep. You could call this a pointless kind of busyness. Someone who had originally secured the qualifications to live in the front building suddenly suffered the pain of unemployment, and life became increasingly tight, so much so that they had to lower themselves to the back building of the female landlord's house. If I can't find a decent job in this short period, then to avoid even more violent attacks from life, I'll have no choice but to retreat to the winter-cold, summer-warm garret to "drink the northwest wind," or bask in the scorching sun. And the last line of defense, needless to say, is the fog-filled, steam-filled kitchen.</p>
<p>For the past year, I've had to move several times, and just dealing with moving places has been exhausting! Speaking of which, my life is really like duckweed or flying catkins, spending my years in a wandering and drifting existence. These feet of mine, which are floating on clouds and mist and which I can't even grasp, I wonder when, in what month, on what day, will they be able to stand firmly. To say something sad, I am not even as good as a bird or a fox. Birds and foxes still have their own fixed nests, but me? I am like a fallen flower without a home!</p>
<p>All the luggage and belongings of a bachelor actually filled a small cart. As I walked down the street escorting the cart puller, I inadvertently noticed that many people had changed into silk or gauze shirts, and some were even wearing serge shirts, while I was still wearing a linen long gown. I didn't realize the season had changed so quickly, showing that there's a disadvantage to not keeping track of the days. Really, a smart person should have more to do with time and space: taking leisurely strolls along the streets and alleys. It would be even better if they could carry a calendar with them!

<h3>First Performance of the Experimental Small Theater</h3>
<p>Since its first performance, the Experimental Small Theater has been preparing for its second performance. Due to unsuccessful negotiations with theaters, performances were suspended for two weeks. It is now reported that the theater will hold its second performance at the New Light Grand Theater on the 21st (Sunday) at 9:30 am. The plays will be "A Corner of the City," "Autumn Sun," and "Smuggling." It is said that the stage of the New Light has been slightly modified, so it should be more suitable for spoken drama performances than the first performance.</p>
