<h3>蒙德婁會議　新公約草案通過初讀　延會至國聯會後再開　蘇聯要求獲三國贊同　反對者現僅日本一國</h3>
<p>蒙德婁　蒙德婁會議、頃於本日晨間、賡續開會、當將土耳其國所提出之新公的草案、初讀予以通過、此項草案第九條載明、各國軍艦凡欲通過韃靼尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽者、當於事前獲得土國政府之允許、同時並當通告國聯會、迨會議討論此案時、日本代表卽駐法大使佐籘、曾起立發言、謂各國軍艦通過海峽、除取獲土國政府允許之外、祗須通吿其他各簽字國、於事已足、母須通吿國聯會、此在主席卽澳洲聯邦駐英特派員勃魯斯、則謂新公的旣須請求國聯會登記、通吿手續自屬必要、佐籘乃答稱、關於此層、日本政府最後之主張、當俟下次會議再行說明、至是會議遂宣吿延會、至國聯大會與行政院會議結束之後再行續開、法國代表卽該國前不管部閣員彭古、業於散會後、飛返巴黎、俾該國參議院討論外交政策時、得以出席參加、（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>蒙特婁　蘇俄代表在考慮土耳其請求修改韃靼納爾海峽公的之會議中所提出應許黑海蘇俄軍艦自由出入海峽之要求、今就各方意見察之、可得土耳其羅馬尼亞法蘭西三國之贊同、列强中迄今反對者、僅日本一國、豫料保加利亞亦將反對、而南斯拉夫則將要求各國對海峽應享同等權利、意外相齊亞諾俟制裁取銷後、將代表意國出席該會議、此間皆料齊亞諾對蘇俄外委李維諾夫之要求、亦將予以有力之反對、該會議今日將延會、至國聯大會特別會議閉幕後續開、蘇俄代表李維諾夫昨在全體會議中復聲明蘇俄要求特別待退、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>蒙特婁　今日韃靼納爾海峽會議舉行全體會議時、蘇俄外委李維諾夫復提出特別待遇之要求、李氏建議所議禁止潛艇通過海峽一節、應兼及飛機母艦、法總代表彭古力主應許履行其國聯盟的下義務之各國以通過海峽之更大自由、日代表佐籘聲稱、對開往黑海軍艦之取締條例、如兼施於駛離黑海之軍艦、則日本準備接受之、英代表史坦賀浦對土耳其限制通過海峽軍艦之噸位以一萬四千噸為限之建議、提出保留、土代表魯煦第謂土政府並不堅持此數字、而將考慮合理的修正、李維諾夫曾對法國所提出應許交戰國之軍艦於履行國聯盟的或在國聯盟的機構內所締結各的下義務時通過海峽之建議、提出修正文、後應彭古之請、允加更改、會議一切討論、將於明日繼續進行、惟全體大會須俟國聯大會舉行後再行召集、（二十六日路透社電）</p>
<h3>各國立塲旗幟分明</h3>
<p>瑞士蒙德婁城　本社外交記者特訊、蒙德婁會議開幕以還、已屆第三日、綜觀此三日經過情形、各關係國所處立塲、今已顯然可覩、茲分述如左、</p>
<p>第一、就土耳其所提出之新公的草案而觀、可見土俄兩國旨趣相同、卽欲限制韃靼尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽之自由通航、俾在實際上封鎖黑海、而使非黑海沿岸各國無從任意出入是也、關於此層、蘇俄外委李維諾夫、在會議席上滔滔而言、其詞旨與一九二三年洛桑會議時、該國代表所發言論如出一轍、蓋在俄國之意、以為黑海在地理上形勢、應於特別重視、一面須封鎖其門戶、母任非黑海沿岸各國軍艦叩關而入、一面則當留此一衣帶水、為黑海沿岸各國艦隊之自由出路、此固該國之傳統政策、李維諾夫所言、乃係秉承前人遺策、而重言以申明之也、此在羅馬尼亞亦係黑海沿岸國家、自亦具有同情、以故該國外長蒂杜樓斯哥對於蘇聯所持見解、卽竭力予以贊助、</p>
<p>第二、就英意兩國而論、則在蒙德婁會議中、兩國頗有互相接近之概、蓋依據最近統計、意國商輪之通過兩海峽者、噸位總數冠於各國、自由通航苟受限制、就意國言之、自屬有百弊而無一利、此在英國、對於嚴訂規律限制通航之議亦所反對、而對於設立特殊制度以利於蘇俄海軍、允若芒刺在背、未便贊同、英意兩國利害攸同、爰乃互送秋波、而有情投意合之感、惟截至現在為止、英國內心雖表異議、但在外表上則僅提出一般性質之保留案、而不遽確定表明立塲、此其態度顯欲待意國對於下列兩點、有所表示、卽　關於兩海峽通航間題、蘇俄不當享有特權、　日本現非國聯會會員國、不當令其與國聯會恢復任何關係是也、</p>
<p>第三、就法國代表彭古昨日所發表之言論而觀、可知該國對於俄土兩國所持見解、不欲加以反對、但以為若干國家他日因履行區域互助公的、或國聯會决議案、為共同目的而有赴戰之義務者、不論在戰時、或平時、均須有自由通過兩海峽之權利、毋得稍受限制、法國此項立塲、在該國內閣總理萊翁勃崙與外長台爾博面、則見解如下、</p>
<p>量的方面在無限制狀態時、日本為期國防之安固、於質的方面確保完全自由、並應整備適於國情之效果的軍備、由此見地、遂决定不參加該條的、至於法的方面、當然不應於事實上遵守誓的、美國海軍因帝國海軍不參加、故恢復十六英寸事、因該條的所規定、因此或係當然之事、又傳待接帝國政府之正式解答後、英美法三國將開始審議、今因更無三國審議之必要、遂預想日意不參加新條的時之情形、而成為明文化、故似不別成問題、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英海相重要演說　力主增強海軍力　為集體安全運用盡責　過去經騐獲兩各敎訓　對英美合作表示同情</h3>
<p>（倫敦）海相霍爾今晚在皇家帝國公會演說、謂今人有以戰爭為必不可免者、此實負疚之愚思也、惟歐洲今滿播引火性之燃料、雖無一國願意宣戰、然苟非如大不列顚之列强、其軍力之雄厚、足使和平之經營中感覺其勢力、則星星之火卽可釀成燎原之勢矣、職是之故、英政府不得不再竭其能力、增速進行英國之海軍程序、設英國陸海空軍咸能及時適當增强之、則自不致有世界戰爭也、霍爾繼乃涉及處此空中權力引起之變遷中、能吾造成一力量相稱之艦隊、旣能敗敵而使海洋開啟、又能駛至任何處、盡其三大要責、卽掩護巡弋運輸之問題、謂海軍參謀部與渠從不若是之愚、敢謂防務已足應付攻擊而有餘、但有人若問及空中權力之降臨、是吾已變更海軍之任務、而不能造成能盡其傳統的職責之艦隊、渠將答曰「吾」、渠左右顧問之建造此種艦隊也、决計充分利用空中權力、如是則可使新艦隊居優越之地位、而成世界最易調動之和平軍隊、吾人就已往六個月已經騐獲有兩種敎訓、一為集體安全之實在運用、卽地中海長駐英艦隊之謂也、英隊艦與集體安全實為二而一、一而二者也、地中海與紅海之英艦隊雖未獲有動員之便利未作審愼之準備、然應付擾攘之憂患、國際之杌　延宕之危局、竟能盡其所受委之職責、忠實而有效力其防止意阿戰爭之廣延也、可謂完全盡責、毫無遺憾、第二敎訓為在理想上、五十國集合之軍力、足稱無敵、然在實際上、此種軍力之價值、全賴各國不特願意與侵略國開戰、且準備於侵略國攻擊時與之作戰、國聯會員國準備出此、甚至作有實效的準備者、唯不列顚一國而已、則在今日世界公意之情態中、不列顚其當自以為能依賴世界遠處而其地主要國復非國聯會員之協力輔助乎、凡此敎訓、示明國聯之依賴英國强有力之海軍為和平大原素之一、初無異於十九世紀之世界也、</p>
<p>復次去秋集體軍事行動之未實現、示明不列顚帝國雖將竭其所有之力以吿成集體安全主義、第仍有賴於帝國之防務、允其為强有力之英海軍、此種敎訓、內國與自治領皆應平心靜氣而沉思者也、今日雖有此種之變遷、但帝國生命繫於其海上交通之根本事實、依然存在、吾人其就已往六個月之敎訓而習得智識、吾人决計阻止流入戰爭、吾國將來之海軍力旣較近數年來為强、則吾人經營和平之勢力必將有增而無减、霍爾末謂渠閱美國海軍聯合會雜誌所載呼籲英美海軍合作使戰爭為不可能之文、旣饒興味、且表同情云（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本拒絕參加　倫敦三國海約　海軍當局說明見解</h3>
<p>（東京）英國政府因帝國政府决定不參加英美法三國海軍條的、致該條的質的限制最重要點之主力艦備砲口徑規定之十五英寸之條欵、其前項遂成一片具文、該條欵後段之但書、乃卽發揮效果、對於十六英寸、似在愼重考慮、惟帝國海軍方斯日前在參衆兩院所發表外交政策宣言書中、已可窺見一斑云、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省由出席蒙特婁會議之佐藤大使接到請訓電報、係關於土耳其政府之要求案者、外務省二十四日徵求海軍省意見、海軍省召開首腦會議之結果、决定如决態度、日本海軍對於土耳其政府表示同情、且不辭盡力改訂海峽制度、然土政府之要求對於由黑海至地中海之蘇俄軍艦施行限制過於寬大、比諸外國軍艦之限制缺乏平均性、此一點為應要改正之項、然日本已經退出國聯、不能與國聯協力負担保障海峽安全之義務、此一點亦須明白宣明、（二十五日同盟社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據東京傳來消息稱、日本內閣對於英法美三國所簽訂之海軍條的决定拒不簽字加入、但聞日本駐英代辦藤井、尙未以此項决定通知外務部、政界人士對於日本態度、並不以為異、此際所注意者、僅為該國今後所抱意向如何耳、易詞言之、卽該國今後趨勢、雖在法理上拒不簽字加入、而在實際上將遵守條的之的束歟、抑或終當出於違反條的之行動歟、一般人現望日本務當適可而止、其拒不加入海的僅係形式的目的、乃在保全該國威望、而無他項用意、特英法美三國海的、規定主力艦備砲口徑、以十四英寸為最高限度、而以日本在一九三七年一月一日（卽三國海的實行生效之日）之前、接受此項的束為條件、以故日本態度、若至本年年底仍不變更、則其影響所及、至少當使主力艦砲徑、由十四英寸加至十六英寸也、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英德海軍協定　解釋並無重大異點</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日下院開會時、有議員請宣述英德海軍協定解釋上意見不同之點、海相霍爾答稱、渠樂為諸員吿者、一切詳則均經滿意友好商决、在解釋上並無任何重大異點云、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>太平洋三小島　美改為殖民地　先發制英闢為空站</h3>
<p>火奴魯魯　美政府已將巴克·迦維斯·好倫·三小島正式作為美殖民地、移美民往居之、衆信此舉目的、蓋欲先發以制英、現已有美學童十二人以海濱巡船由火奴魯魯載送諸島、每島留四人、並樹美旗於其上、按近今擬關火奴魯魯至紐絲倫航空錢時、議以三島為飛機停駐所、曾為衆所注意、（二十五日路透社電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院定於朋日午後五時舉行非常會議、當由英國外相艾登担任主席、法國外長台爾博斯亦當出席參加、此乃生平第一次、意國代表團仍當缺席、行政院非常會議議事日程如次、　英國委任統治地伊拉克境內亞西利案與加爾地安兩項少數民族安揷問題、　海外國際常設法庭德國籍法官蘇慶出缺、美國籍法官凱洛格辭職、所遺之缺遞補問題、　羅卡諾公約與德國軍隊重行開入萊茵河區域問題、　意國兼倂阿比西尼亞問題、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）阿王已於今日首途赴日內瓦、送行者皆高呼一佳運」「上帝福君」、王以莊嚴之態作答、王於瀕行時、致詞深謝英國人民對渠所表示之光明同情、阿使署今日發表六月二十三日阿王與英外相艾登之談片、其中云及阿王曾表示擬在日內瓦竭力抗對議意制裁之取銷、並促請國聯取更有力之計劃以對付意國、俾張公道、（廿五日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）阿皇本日午後二時自維多利亞車站首途往日內瓦、英國政府不擬派遣代表前往歡送官方人士頃宣稱、外國元首凡以私人名義旅行者、英國政府例不派員接送云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法外長　啓程赴日內瓦　艾登途次巴黎小作勾留</h3>
<p>（倫敦）國聯會開會之期、近在眉睫、屆時對意制裁政策放棄之議、卽當通過實行、而國聯會改組之議、亦當由大多數會員國、提付討論、此萬目睽睽之名劇、其最初一幕、當在此間揭開之、緣內閣定於本日上午舉行會議、而以最後訓令、授予艾登外相、以為代表英國折衝壇玷之準繩、艾登受訓之後、卽當於本日下午、搭乘飛機、遄赴巴黎、旣抵法京、並當與法國總理白倫·外交部長台爾博斯、同席出胳、藉以交換意見、此外、阿比西尼亞皇帝、亦當同時啓程、前往日內瓦、據聞阿皇並不親自出而活動、但欲與國聯會阿國代表團保持密切聯絡、至瑞士聯邦政府、砟曾通知阿皇、謂在意阿爭端延未結束之前、務請放棄下居瑞士之議、因此阿皇擬俟國聯大會會期結束之後、卽離開瑞士、隱居鄉間、其地點大的在英國勃萊頓港附近云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>巴赫蘭羣島　主權為英攘奪　伊蘭向國聯二次抗議</h3>

<h3>中航公司籌闢　四川沿江航綫</h3>
<p>新購巨型機加入長江綫</p>

<h3>日文報紙　川越對華政策</h3>
<p>與前任大使色彩有異</p>
<p>外論社譯上海每日新聞云、川越新駐華大使之來華、果將如何找開陷於僵局之中日國交、係有頗深之意義、該大使於二十二日上陸以來、已略將其所懷抱對華政策之經綸披瀝、此等自係片段所見、然由此固不難窺見該大使所懷抱之經綸之根幹、其中尤爲吾人所應注應者、爲該大使對華之抱負、較之政治、其重心似有尤在於經濟之感、此爲與從來之駐華大使色彩略有不同之處、且中日國交調整發展之以此爲基調、亦兩國皆不能不希望之事、然所謂川樾大使對華經濟的抱負、又果係如何性質之物乎、</p>
<p>據該大使來華前後各次機會所表示之對華經濟抱負之具體內容言之、似大體在於鐵道之建設、及礦業之調查與開發、鐵道之建設、在中國爲急如烯眉之問題、不待贅言、地大物博之中國、因鐵道之敷設缺乏之故、物埋於地、諸產業之發展遲遲、且經濟之外、政治的統一、亦因此之故、頗有有待百年河淸之槪、鐵道建設、爲急務中之急務、中國自身知之最深、對於此事、日本協力、在某種條件上、自不能不謂對中國有益之事、而所謂協力、無資金之日本、不能貸借金銀、自係指提供材料與技術、中國方面、設若將日本顧提供之物利用、進行鐵道之建設、則百年之大計、利益頗大、條件及其他所謂枝葉未節、皆僅徼未之問題、吾人相信最近之將來、川越大使設提議此項問題、不懷疑應諾、乃賢明之策也、其次礦業之調查開發、對於中國、亦與鐵道同樣、爲頗有重要之問題、河南及福建之鐵鑛、陜西之石油、湖南之銻、湖南廣西之錳、及華北一帶之煤、地下皆有無量之埋藏、此亦未充足與大宗之輸出、此與日本協力亦雙方互有利益也、</p>
<p>川越大使對於經濟的抱負如上、此對雙方皆頗有益、若中國方面有中日提携之誠意、則具體內容上縱雖有多少之異議、而大體之大綱上、當必可承認也、</p>

<p>各區查緝　本市各區公安分局及區所、因第二期換領烟照展期、至本月底截止後、至絕止期衹有五日、故市公安局特派查緝股全體工作人員、分赴各區、會同駐在地之管轄分局及區所加緊擠查、如第二期限期截止、而未換領執照者、經查獲後、即解送淞滬警備司令部嚴行究辦、至公務人員吸食雅片者、亦經警局咨照各機關速行戒除、否則即依法檢舉澈究云、</p>

<h3>上海之榨油業</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之二十九）</p>
<p>二，原料</p>
<p>本埠之榨油業與麵粉業頗有類同之點，即麵粉業每因小麥來源減少或斷絕而停業，榨油業亦常因各種種植物種子缺乏而不能繼續生產，故原料之供給情況與該業前途頗有關係。本埠各榨油廠之出品，以棉油·荳油·生油·菜油爲主，今將其原料供給情形分析於后：</p>
<p>一，棉子——棉油之原料爲棉子，棉子寄附於棉花苞內。按其顏色而分，有綠黑白二種，油質以綠色爲最當。按其種別而言，有美棉印棉埃棉等棉子之別，油質以埃棉棉子爲最多，約有百分之十六。至本埠所需之棉子，其來源有三，一爲川湘鄂陝之棉田區域，年達二百餘萬擔；二爲浙江之紹興餘姚一帶，年僅二十萬擔；三爲江蘇大江南北之新墾棉區，年達八十萬擔。冀魯本爲廣大之棉產區域，僅次於西北，但因日人起而壟斷，幾已無補於我國之榨油業，除爭取我國原料外，亦有獨占我國棉子之附帶作用，對於我國或本埠榨油業之窒礙，亦必不亞於棉紡織業方面，此爲國人所忽略而應重加注意者也。</p>
<p>二，黃豆——豆油之原料爲黃豆，黃豆之種類極多，大別有黃豆·金元·白眉·黑臍四種，黃豆即普通所稱至大豆，產量最多，因爲亦爲豆油之主要原料。金元以其色黃形圓，故名，含油頗多。白眉又稱白斑或大白眉。黑臍又名黑腹，以其腹部一有白色之筋，一有黑褐色之筋，所含油脂皆較金元爲多。我國爲產豆最豐之國家，如長江流域之湖北湖南安徽江蘇四省，黃河流域之河南山東山西三省，皆有出產，惟以東北所產者爲最多，本埠所需之黃豆，除一部份由江蘇一省供給外，其餘皆自長江上流及津浦一帶採購而來、</p>
<p>三，花生——生油即爲花生油，其原料自爲去壳之花生仁，品質上下按每盎斯所包含之粒數多寡而定，大致以一盎斯合二十八粒者爲最佳，合四五十粒者爲最劣。前者每擔可榨油六十斤，後者可榨油三十斤，普通之花生仁可榨油五十斤，我國各省之氣候土質，大致皆宜培植花生，故花生之出產幾遍全國，惟以山東出產爲最多，年達一萬七千餘萬擔，湖南福建等省最少，年約一百萬擔上下。本埠所需之花生仁，大多在青島徐州成交。</p>
<p>四，菜子——菜子爲菜油之原料，生產該項菜子之蔬菜，以內地鄉民所呼之油菜爲主。今將其種類及各類乾燥時所含之油量列表如次：</p>
<p>菜子之重要產區爲江浙皖三省及晉魯冀之油行銷內地，已將作爲燃料之豆油地位，取而代之，故豆油在內地，目下僅供烹調之用，因而大部份菜子，亦由農村輸入本埠矣。</p>
<p>此外本埠年來已有椰子油之生產，且聞在事業部扶植之下，不久或將有桐油廠之出現，故椰子及桐子兩種原料，吾人亦不容忽視。再前述各種榨油原料，除棉子主要向本埠各紗廠收買外，餘皆由廠方派員在內地採購，內地商販向本埠油廠兜售者亦有之，本埠之雜糧行亦往往經營該項原料之經營。（未完）</p>
<p>康健之路</p>
<h3>根治淋濁之新藥</h3>
<p>惟「克淋儂」一藥可當之無愧</p>
<p>除病本須藥餌，如藥餌與病情相對，則奏效自速，反之藥不對症，或雖服藥而無功效，如此反將病勢增重。此不僅萬病如此，尤其是淋病爲顯明。故對於淋病選擇藥物，亦更須愼重選擇，因淋病服藥如不相符，反增其變化故也。</p>
<p>所謂理想中之治淋特效劑，爲殺菌，抗淋，消炎鎭重，此等淋藥，從前不過爲一種理想而已。現在理想已成事實，即羅彼得氏所發明之「克淋儂」一藥而已。考「克淋儂」一藥，不僅含有透膜殺菌之作用，並能於服後能在體內發生一種抗毒免疫功效。所以凡遇有淋菌之處，無不被「克林儂」所包圍而滅殺之。其健全部份，仍可毫無傷害。對於急性前尿道炎，及慢性後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，睾丸炎，關節炎等，無不奏效如神，此等功效，久已爲世界各大著名醫家試用證明。堪稱爲治淋藥申傑出之新藥者。至於婦女如罹淋毒性白帶，亦最宜服用。一方更用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」，每晚取一片納入陰道，能在數星期內，即可完全根治。现在吾國服「克淋儂」而愈者，数已逾萬矣。</p>
<h3>特種原因之胃病</h3>
<p>胃病有由於幾種特殊原因而來者，如吸烟家之唾液吞入後，則刺激胃之內面，而發生加答兒症，又由於常習之飲酒，多患慢性胃加答兒，早晨嘔吐多量粘液，是謂之酒客早晨嘔吐。其他肝臟，腎臟，肺臟，心臟等之疾病，亦恒伴發胃症，故胃病爲一不可忽視之症候。</p>
<p>對於胃病之主治，當然以減除胃內刺激而改造其機能爲上，若因其他臟器病變而來之胃病，亦可先事昂盛胃慾，以增加食量，期於營養佳良？自易恢復康健也，法郎府之「強胃病」一藥，功擅改善消化機能，增進食慾，並減除腸內酵氣，故於急慢性之胃加答兒，胃痙攣，胃擴張等症之胸部灼熱，嘈雜欲嘔，吞酸噯氣，　逆飽滿，食後作脹，腹痛隱隱，見饭生畏，以及腸嗚腹瀉，大便乾結，冷屁特多等，均奏奇效，以本藥係酵　之複方製劑，酵　之成分如維他命甲乙丁，均有貴重之補力，尤能確治缺乏維他命乙之脚氣症，殊有極佳之成績，就中又含蛋黃素，爲烟客便秘或戒煙之良品，且能療小兒吐乳及綠便等，並因其富含營養鹽，較他劑尤有偉大之滋補性，而堪爲常年之養身食餌。</p>
<h3>發育障害之挽救</h3>
<p>對於發育障害，爲現代人類最大之苦悶，尤其正當發育期間之青年男女，更爲苦悶。默察此等不發育之原因，多爲濫施自凟，及早婚房事過度，致下體發育不能如一般人之完全，因而身體亦矮小而不健全。考人之發育，完全由於內分泌關係，而內分泌中之生殖腺，對於生殖之發育上、尤關重要，往往因此等腺體受傷而誘起遺精，早漏，下部勃起力不健全，心悸目眩，失眠頭痛，易動盱火，心情煩躁。作事有始無終，易超悲觀，他如記憶力之欠缺，面色之萎黄，唇色黯淡，腰酸背痛，四肢無力等，往往見於發育不全之人。至於女子，則經水乖亂，臀部乳房，均不能正常發育。</p>
<p>梅倫氏鑒於男女沈淪苦海，達决然努力研究，發明男用『補體康』女用『補女容』二藥，係從勇壯之牝牡之獸類睪丸與卵巢，更用种學方法，提出荷爾蒙，分別製成。功能促進內分泌之機能旺盛，使人體各部，達到發育完全之境。而遺精等病。亦同時治愈之。至於月經失調，白帶下，及久婚失姙等症，服『補女容』一藥後，亦能在數星期後，達到治愈之目的。更能使肌肉豐腴細腻，血色滿面，作事興趣盎然，而增加工作效率。固不僅却病已也。</p>
<h3>遺精之根本解决</h3>
<p>遺精之原因，乃由手淫　傷性機能，而致精管鬆弛，遺精頻仍，以陷於神經衰弱，如記憶力銳减，頭痛、眩暈，貧血羸瘦等，所以本症實爲人類之大患。</p>
<p>舊有製劑，其藥力穩妥者未必效捷，而功速者又未必性純，耐氏『育精片』一藥，則確能畏本解决遺精，如遺精不論次数多少，日間滑　，大小便或用力時漏精等，又因遺精而来之神經喪　症，皆有良效，又能减去中樞神經之剩激，故手淫即可戒止，實至王道之聖品。中西藥房有售。</p>
<h3>療淋以何法爲最效？</h3>
<p>淋病在急性之時，不難施治，惟一經轉入慢性，則根治殊爲不易，蓋急性淋屬於前尿道，慢性則隸於後尿道或　及全身也。尤以全身性淋毒，如敗血症，狹心症等最爲危險，生命有不測之虞，其他目盲，關節炎等，亦往往陷於殘廢，故淋病必須根本解决，然常人在急性時，每以爲服一二瓶製劑即已　事，實則淋毒並未全去，仍將俟機再發，故除淋實不可專靠局部『透膜殺菌』，必非使全身毒素肅清不可，</p>
<p>依動物之實騐桔果，認淋菌之消滅，乃全由於『結合補體』之生成，蓋即係血清中，所生之溶茵作用是也。『克淋儂』一藥之藥理與治效，即在能使血清發生溶菌現象，而產生『結合補體』，故其撲滅淋菌，有不能想像之像力，又以其藥力並非直接刺激患部，而係導發體中之『免疫元』，以吞喰菌毒，所以藥性王道而純良，毫無敗胃與任何流弊，惟須注意者，購服時務宜認定『克淋儂』三字，切勿兒戲出之，或因受其他製品之朦混欺人與妄聽他人言，而購服廉價雜牌劣蘗，致危害生命，不可不愼，歐洲各國，咸認『克淋儂』爲最適當而有效之製劑，無論男女之急慢性淋與膀胱睪丸攝護腺及關節炎等，女子子宮淋，陰門淋，服此皆可痊瘳，於短期內徹底斷根不發云。</p>
<h3>如何克治白帶</h3>
<p>婦女白帶，乃極一纏綿而可厭之病。然以其平常而忽之，这於不知不覺之中，釀成病變。如因臚道污濁，易爲細菌所乘，發炎糜爛，影響小便，少腹脹悶不暢，而來月經之失調，致招不孕之後果。</p>
<p>『卡而雪地氏陰道片』一藥，爲滌除白帶之聖品，功能滌淨腔道內之分泌物，平復創痛，驅逐細菌，每晚可用一片放入局部，次晨洗去，用法簡便，可在家秘密自療。惟因丈夫淋毒傳染者，可兼服『克淋礦』，以除內部之淋毒，因髋虚而來者，可兼服『補女容』，以强壯其身體，調整其月經。依此服用，無不在短期間治愈之。是誠克治白带之聖藥也。</p>
<h3>久咳成癆之理論舆治法</h3>
<p>諺有之，『傷風不醒變成癆』，蓋因傷風之後，引起氣管加答兒，若不即時予以速治，則延爲久咳，結核菌乃乘機活動，侵蝕肺組織，而繁殖子孫，於是肺臟壞矣，成爲肺痹症，突然喀血，或無特別之原因，不思飲食，且起噁心下瘌等，咳日加據，痰日益多，時混血痰，呼吸困難，由是貧血衰瘦遂呻吟於病榻，凡事須愼之於始，如常本病初期失其調治，關係於生命匪浅，故必速行就醫，但藥洽之中，求能達到有病治病，無病防癆之目的者，則僅見法郎府大藥廠『補肺拿兒』一藥，奏效甚著。蓋治愈久咳內傷之原理，復迅速弭除氣管之炎症，而增加肺中之石灰質，則咳症自瘳，癆患可防，『柿肺拿爾』爲內含大量之鈣製品，有促增石灰質以填補肺內傷痕之功，而使癆菌無所逞其活動，終之被　困於其中，缺乏養料之供給，遂　於餓死，况一方又因『補肺拿爾』能亢進　　，增進食物之吸牧，產生强力的血球，而虽其猛第之　　力，癆　雖欲不死不可得也，故本藥對於肺癆咯血，　嗆多痰，　痛潮熱，盜汙倦怠，身瘦貧血等，雅有奇效，又善治百日咳，哮喘氣急等頑固症，在肺癆有神經衰弱時，多見失眠心悸，男子則兼有遺精腰　，可用『補體康』與本藥同服，以止遺壯腦，婦女兼患月經病，則可兼服『補女律』補血調經，然後體力旺盛，抵抗力強，恢復並增進其原有之健康云。</p>

<p>膿汁淋漓</p>
<p>孫甫平君，前染淋病，初起小便頻數而灼热，旋於尿道口發見膿汁，濁液淋漓，易舉陽，舉則疼痛，放尿不自然，包皮浮腫，小便帶血，痛楚彌甚，後聞『克淋儂』卓著奇效，即購置三瓶，藥未服完，膿濁减少，疼痛較瘥，遂安心大量進服，約及五瓶，腫退尿清，諸恙霍然，今歷半載未發，確證全部根除也。</p>

<p>自帶根瘳</p>
<p>章素封君，因冶遊而染白濁，不愼攝生，遂傳諸其夫人，致亦患淋毒性白带，月經不調，惡垢流溢，少腹膨脹，小便刺痛，陰戶瘙　爛濕，坐臥不安，污染褲　，聞者掩鼻，迭治莫愈，後因章君服「克淋儂」而獲淋濁瘳愈，乃亦仿服，並同時外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」每晚睡前納入陰道内一二片，用前用後，均以開水洗淨，爲期匝月，帶止經調，糜爛局面，完全收複，痛癢告除，夫婦稱賞不置云。</p>
<p>白濁精漏</p>
<p>患者秦澍封君，患淋病數年，久治不愈，體益虚弱，每晨膿濁封口，小便難出，點滴涓流，小便時带血液，夜間並有遺精之患，莖中癢痛，精神蒌靡不堪，經服「克淋儂」四瓶，淋濁盡失，恐防復發，又續服數瓶，同時並眼「補體康」以治虚弱，爲期數星期，即獲全治。</p>

<p>漫性淋之治療</p>
<p>淋病一成慢性，變症因而層出不窮，慢性淋之所以難愈者，其故即在於此。一般淋病初起，其病灶不過多在尿道的前部。此時淋毒既未有根據地，欲行瞿逐，最爲容易，因前尿道之組織，甚爲簡單，淋菌不易藏身，一旦成爲慢性，則淋菌出前尿道而後尿道。更由後尿道侵入睪丸，輪精管，精囊，及副尿道等等器官。</p>
<p>慢性最顯著之證象，表面上並無急性時之劇痛，有時若有若無，流出白濁，不過一二點，又往往外證上幾乎不見淋病之症狀，必待有所刺戟之後，始行發作。若將病者之尿質，用顯微鏡檢查，必有許多淋菌，在尿中發見。因爲此等細菌，恒附緣於尿道之粘膜上，往往與排尿及射精時，一同出來，所以最易傳染異性。</p>
<p>對於此等慢性之治療，須行特殊方法。余於臨床上恒用抗淋血清，及X組以掃除淋菌，更輔以電氣療法，及內服治淋特效藥，無不於最短期內治愈。因此等療法，係採取圍剿政策，使淋菌無從逃避也。至於女子患淋毒性白带者，可内服治淋特效劑，外刚陰道片，亦能於短期內，收根治之效也。</p>

<h3>亞林匹克　躍水比賽之內容及各式躍水之圖解　（一）</h3>
<p>— 錢一動</p>
<p>小言</p>
<p>英文Diving一字國人每譯為「入水」、（見現行游泳規則）細加考慮、殊覺未妥、不若稱為「躍水」較佳、躍者蓋含魚躍之意、即就專門方面而言、躍水之核心確在乎躍起經過空中之際、而不在乎入水之一剎那、雖入水亦屬躍水範圍以內之事、然其所關究微、故注重點為「躍」而非「入」也、就躍水之本身而言「躍水員應竭力以求跳躍之騰高實屬至要、至於沒入水中以後、則躍水之動作、已告完畢矣、躍永一項在游泳中、係屬一種專技、然吾國運動員未能引起普遍之興趣與訓練、其故雖多、然因在全運會中僅列為一種表演之節目、實乃重大原因之一、故今後亟應改為正式錦標比賽節目（請參看拙作「辦理運動會應加改進諸點」一文、該文載於勤奮體育月報第三卷第七期）且應採用亞林匹克之躍水項目及規則、此實草譯本文之動機、</p>

<h3>商業金融平平過去</h3>
<p>本年商業、就外表觀察、雖似進步、且有少數銀行、合組銀團、救濟農村及繭茶等放欵、而實際如何、尚難言之、至於商業信用放欵、近來端靠實力、茍本身能力薄弱、自顧不暇、何能顧人、故本屆半年結帳情形、十之七八無利可圖、如通易信托公司之停業、半雖由於投機失敗所致、而半屬歷年虧耗。及每屆結賬時呆賬甚多、遂爾周旋不靈、此種情形、在在可慮、能不蝕折、已屬萬幸、欲圖盈餘、除少數各大銀行外、殊屬寥寥、至謂全部商業、漸呈復蘇之象、誠爲吾人所希望也、</p>
<h3>證券　八月份公債昨已上場市面依然振作不起</h3>
<p>由低而高：由高轉降：頗似拋物綫</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、八月份期貨開始上場、適逢湘邊謠言又嚴重、八月份期貨於第一塲即行如數開出、市價大都均較近期小三元、除利息計算、適相符合、惟套利則仍無利息可圖、市況仍係疲羅之途、時局則湘邊軍隊、接觸堪虞、并有增加籌碼之說、會北謠言未息、環境如是、儐市上翔、殊屬不易、昨日經過、上午開盤、賣氣又旺、五號三十五及四十七號等均有賣出、十一及五十四號買進、八月份期貨亦一律開出、市價一致下降三角至半元、次盤空方抵補甚力、惟大都爲零星散戶居多、回風甚勁、丁種狂漲七角半、餘亦好四五角不等、午後開盤、初拍繼續趨堅、戊丁兩種續漲一角至四角、拍丙種時、謠言突至、四號十號四十七號等賣出狂湧、丙種頓爲壓小二角半、乙種小七角之多、甲種亦小三角左右、趨勢頓受打擊、高則有人拋賣、小則有人抵進、故市價有大範圍盤旋狀、前方戰事、是否爆烈、抑尚有轉圜餘地、爲目下市價高低、緊要關鍵、觀午後收盤市價之疲莫能興、前途再見新低價、亦意中事也、市價結果、除八月份初開出不計外、丁種尚漲一角、餘則均略小五分一角至二角、趨勢係由低而高、復又由高轉降、完全振作不起之象、成交總數、共計九百十五尤五千元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗愈覺鬆懈</h3>
<p>本月因有套利尚安定</p>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風益熾、蓋以環境不良、市場定氣不佳、故本月份局勢雖安定、然遠期賣方活躍、市盤步趨下游、同時現紗生意凋敝、人心愈弱、本月份最後一盤價爲二百零一元四角、比上月漲六元四角云、</p>
<p>遠期跌一元半　標紗前市開盤、因海外紗花反動下落、人氣不振、市象均呈下降之勢、檯面尤鬆、買者缺乏、結果五月比上日收盤價跌五·至一元、惟本月套利者買進較堅、勿動、午後開盤本月期大孚扒空而堅、但拍至遠期、轉趨疲乏、二三盤以原棉乏力、且市上流言紛紜、賣氣更盛、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌七·九·角、本月僅跌一角、查賣出吉豐一千包、裕大二千四百五十包、明德六百包、賡豐一千二百五十包、愼昌一千零五十包、豐泰一千三百五十包、泰昌八百包、益昶一千五百五十包、長豐一千四百包、大豐七百包、義成九百包、買進大孚一千六百五十包、聚興六百包、合興一千一百包、愼記一千四百五十包、協成二千一百包、生源一千二百包、永大七百包、信誠八百五十包、達記一千九百五十包、一日開最高低價、及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>紗綫售價均跌　現紗銷路仍平澹、查全歸各幫買去統計三百六十包、售價跌一元、綫跌二元、各幫買額列下、</p>
<h3>本月花午後突跌八角</h3>
<p>棉市以連漲多日日之美印棉市、轉趨下跌、人心虛弱、且一般棉商多數業已翻空、檯面愈帶鬆懈、本月份爲最後一天營業、市態頗覺軟化、末盤價突跌爲四十五元半、比上月尚漲三元半矣、</p>
<p>標花賣氣濃厚　標花前市開盤、本月份因交貨籌碼未見十分充盈、市況尚安定、但拍至遠月、氣勢轉挫、賣者踴躍、各月均跌二·三角、新棉因天氣順適、賣風愈強、結果各月比上日收租界介均跌五分至三角半、本月跌五分、午後開盤本月份多方無甚舉動、市態軟化、盤盤下墮、本月爲五元半收盤、七月份亦打破六元關口、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二角半至三角半、惟本月獨跌八角、查賣出同孚一千五百擔、裕天二千七百擔、明德一千八百擔、賡豐三千一百擔、愼記三千七百擔、大昌成三千五百擔、益康二千二百擔、同和一千六百擔、新昶四千擔、合興三千六百擔、興昌二千二百擔、長和三千二百擔、元一二千二百擔、義成三千三百擔、源興昌四千擔、買進長豐八千六百擔、梅記三千三百擔、振大一千七百擔、潤康五千三百擔、協成一千三百擔、信誠一千一百擔、源大一千一百擔、賡豐八千擔、生源一千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>華商購棉不絕　現棉消費尚稱不薄、華廠進胃尚健、來源姚花二千二百包云、</p>
<h3>美棉平疲英印俱跌</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市況平疲、各月跌二至六磅音、利物浦消息雖佳、然因遠東賣出、棉農套賣、多頭了結、及現貨商拋售、市勢不振、惟同業本地幫及大陸幫依然吸收、成交不多、旋以倉庫商及華爾街買進、市價回好、七月期因多頭了結、南方賣出、及現貨商脫手、仍無起見、收盤平穩、計現貨跌十二磅音、期貨跌十二至漲四磅音、英棉現貨跌一點、期貨跌六七點、印棉始因歐洲出口商買進而漲、後因多頭了結而回、計平果爾跌〇·七五至一羅比、奧姆辣跌一·七五至二·二五羅比、白羅溪跌一·七五至二·七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十四日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十五日四五月期白羅溪花開盤預測、爲二百十三羅比、較上日跌半羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗跌花平</p>
<p>二十五日大阪電、三品期紗跌六角至二元三角、近月爲二百零五元一角、遠月爲一百九十九元九角、期棉漲一角至跌一角五分、近月爲六十五元五角、遠月爲六十一元三角五分、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布市況漲後的回定</h3>
<p>布市因週前受外棉猛漲之刺激、市面甚佳、中外各廠本月份貨額開售一空、致各貨售盤蒸蒸日上、昨以標紗花形勢回軟、各號所吸貨額充盈、東貨又以月底墊銀將屆、漸肯脫手、市盤轉鬆、每疋二分半至五分、日商洋行有開出七月份期貨、陽鶴喇叭竄藍日講擋細布四百餘包、價較前日小二分半、多數係本埠染廠所收進、華貨因漲勢較緩和、故仍頗堅硬、怡和粗布售盤昨已開出、九磅貓鷹·五福·及十一磅飛熊·九天·漲五分、經本街及內地幫進一百數十包、各路實銷、仍以本埠染廠白坯細布、及川路色布生意爲最暢、浙贛皖各埠條子府綢·嗶嘰·縐呢·細布·細斜等貨、交易仍形活潑、滇幫亦辦細斜·藍布·印花直貢·印花絨·等貨二百數十件云、</p>
<h3>糧食　實銷可可向所抽買期粉回漲尤力</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈初平繼穩之象、洋麥報價、芝加哥微好四分、加拿大好一二角、當　價時、以人心仍見浮動、故開價平平、惟自二盤之後、因傳本埠廠方、際此新麥登場之時、出品倍盛、故前則現粉、曾開三元二角或一角半、今已可向交易所抽買、祗須照加一角、凡有現銷客戶、自然抽動見殷、復以前日之跌勢太猛、未見回頭、故開價即步步良好、迫至下午開盤、交易略淡、市仍挺住、較之上午、續漲一分外、據業中人之推考、目下雖屬出新旺令、而各路銷塲、亦必逐步推展、是以後步榮辱、當以實銷爲轉移云、</p>
<h3>業外紛起吸進　期麥反漲一角許</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份反漲頗烈、因到貨雖湧、惟客戶奪貨未見暢旺、且以外行吸戶、力量未可輕視、因此各月份交易未盛、價則已提漲三五分、迨至下午開盤、本月份因交割已近、漲度尚微、七月份以下、則買進甚暢、市價步步昂貴、此種漲落不定之局面、大部分仍屬時局不甯、以致投機者依然熱奮也、如七月份竟反漲一角、餘亦漲八九分、現麥市面、到源仍旺、銷亦奇暢、高貨未有上落、中關貨則提好三分、聞瑤灣麥四元四角三分、明光管店臨准關麥四元二角、江北麥四元一角半、次一角、高郵麥四元一角六分、次一角三分、蕪湖麥四元零七分、揚州麥四元零七八分、南京麥四元零三分、漢口麥三元九角七分、次九角、維安麥四元一角六七分、紹興麥四元一角三四分、浦鎭麥四元零七八分、高資平衡四元零七分、祟明麥三元九角四分、崑山麥三元九角半、巴城麥三元九角五六分、常熟麥四元零八分半、麥萊麥三元九角、次八角七分、由福新辦去一萬二千包、阜豐去八千包、申大去二千包云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、市價與進口比價相近、故套賣增多、預測西北大氣有變、旱災消息現漸失效力、天雨價將暴跌、以後則將迂緩步漲、</p>
<h3>火餅汛已屆　豆餅漲風可畏</h3>
<p>一日間暴跳四五分</p>
<p>昨日豆餅市況、暴漲四五分之鉅、實以標準受制於大連、內地銷塲、見華南云路發動、一般心思都看漲、故各鄉採辦紛起、市塲中市價一度紛亂、上香四牌餅曾開二元零六分之最低價、其後逐漸抬至零九分、至下午趨勢更挺、價自二元一角·角一分·角二分·最後突提至二元一角四分、看其形勢漲風一時尚未能稍殺也、統計成交輪船沙河光邊餅三千片、各廠四牌餅二萬六七千片、</p>
<h3>連電一日數漲標準餅豆繼續高騰</h3>
<p>豆漲一角外……餅好三四分</p>
<p>標準餅豆兩市、昨日續見飛騰、　豆因現銷廠客兩旺、產價高昂、市氣尤佳豆餅實銷亦已旺動、且屆火餅汛、人心本在望好、再如原料牽制、市乃步步上展、昨日更以大連來電一日數漲、買氣愈盛、而業外囤戶與投機活躍更力、故午前尚在盤旋中、午後標豆突升一角、收市標豆激漲一角二分之鉅、標餅午前平正、午後亦激漲三四分、</p>
<h3>白粳平定杜尖帶緊</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各幫來源、共到二十四五號、貨共五千餘石、未街銷塲較前已遜、包胃僅大連幫辦七八百包、故市露軟象、南港早稻回修幾分、薄稻亦然、僅蘇同粳以連日到稀尚可支持、杜洋尖因客尖頗堅、形勢帶緊、陰變元無進出、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源、十五六號、存船亦稀、約七八十艘、市上各貨銷胃依然平淡、白粳早市喊緊近角、午市轉定、薄稻價加角許、陰元定立、白元加緊數分至一角、杜尖價加角外、客尖貨稱銷活、市形又緊一角左右、其餘各貨、價均挺立、</p>
<h3>海味海參滯銷市價轉小</h3>
<p>海參東西洋來源、均仍缺少、街上存底、亦甚薄弱、但因客路生意勿動、市價反轉跌勢、邇日行盤、兜售頂隻十番參二百九十元、大隻二百七十五元、大中隻二百五十元、中隻二百三十元、中小隻二百零五元、八甲參細皮二百十五元、粗皮一百八九十元、金山四支頂紅靴參二百四十八元、四六支沖紅靴參一百七十八元、六支一百七十五元、六八支一百六十六元、八支一百六十二元、八十支一百五十六元、十支一百五十元、十二支一百三十元、十六支一百二十五元、望加錫白靴　參六八支一百三十元、十支一百二十元、北海靴　參四六支一百四十八元、非洲靴參八十支九十元、八支馬利士靴參一百十元、八支青蟲參九十六元、十二支八十五元、二支白岩參一百六十元、三支一百三十元、四支一百十元、六支九十八元、望三支梅花參二百二十四元、四支二百元、五支一百九十元、六支一百七十八元、小隻一百六十元、望四六支灰岩參一百七十五元、八支一百五十五元、十二支一百四十元、二十支一百二十元、小隻一百元、金山磊中禿參一百二十元、中隻九十二三元、檳榔嶼中禿參七十元、內河中禿七十三元、小隻六十四元、沉香頂玉參一百零四元、大隻九十六元、</p>

<h3>山中舊札</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>—一九三五年秋，來滬之前—</p>
<p>Rosa！你底信又激起了我心中底波瀾，山間底甯靜那裏能使得我心甯靜啊。</p>
<p>「個人　養在大自然裏，減輕不了你底病症，那　是要深沉下去！」R，這是你給我底警告，你知道我　　地被此語感動！</p>
<p>如果我早接觸着ph．底　，我會鼓起勇氣不顧一切地投奔到上海去，去投入那生之洪潮裏；如果我來此之前的見着了，我會　　這「高高的山」——你爲什麽這麼俏皮呢——，去住你那間「小小的房」的。但是我已　着來此「避秋」——現在已是那些有錢而又有閑的城市裏來底避暑的不速之客下山之時，我之來此，愈覺古城中「秋風秋雨秋煞人」，因藉山中暫避——，而且昨天業經掏出我袋子，裏十元鈔票中底七章獻納給替女婿帶女孩看守別墅的慶誠崇信上帝天天　　告喝聖　的老太太了。即令是「更覺秋　秋不盡」，那也祗好忍受了這「耿耿秋燈秋夜長，」且把我底頭埋向我帶來底一大堆索解宇宙和人生之究竟的　書中以消磨這一個月吧！我與其被軟禁在一個糜爛的生活　裏隨人去作低級的享樂，而且要伍洪一位思想上的劊子手宰制我底靈魂；我再也不能選擇旁的道路：我乃逃　於此山林之中，藉以拼絕那毒氣，派遣深藏我心的苦悶。我未嘗不想到，我寂寞的心因此會更加寂寞；但這兒雖寂寞，尚能呼吸一些清新的空氣。我若長逗留於脂粉氣與麻醉劑的　圍，僅存的一點自我底清新之氣也要被　濁化呀！</p>
<p>R！人如果不能積極地反抗命運時，命運便不容許你選擇。你如果缺乏自持之力，命運便要完全支配你</p>
<p>我不是已被屈服於一種支配力之下而祗是在微弱地掙扎麼。傷心的掙扎！可鄙的掙扎！在我們自身上是不會生長新的力量了的，是麼？是麼？——暴風雨呢？閃電呢？太陽呢？</p>
<p>當我自覺是一個　的呼喊者時，我便傾跌在地上。我希望有一個人來叫一聲：「跌倒了的伙伴，爬起來…」</p>
<p>你是這末一個人。</p>
<p>我們要把握再生之力！</p>
<p>你已經接到Ali底信麼？那用不着喜，也用不着悲；跌倒了能爬起來就好了。如果過去底Ali死了，祝它現在或是不久的將來復活吧！</p>
<p>沉淪是太可怕了：不論沉淪在濠溝裏，粉紅色的夢裏，或是蒼白色的啞裏都是可怕的。</p>
<p>ph．說他是「立在邊緣上」，那是依繫於地心吸力的。立在邊緣，追隨着前進，前進吧！雖然，縱令不成爲推動力。</p>
<p>一人離辟索居，常好沉思，我愈沉思，我愈掉落在玄學的圈套裏；那也會爬不起來的。</p>
<p>回頭談我們底實際生活吧：這一個月我決定在此住下去，你容許我在此　逍一月吧。我是極願意和你住一起的，而且我也極喜歡你底慈愛的母親和乖乖小寶寶，我想終結了這一個月再搬到你們那兒；　若上海逐去不成的話。——如果，上海，自己連找飯吃都找不着時，文化的鮮果市場也飽不了肚——。我在打算來此之前本來就意想到你那兒去的，但我底神經裏弱的腦子，現在凡是都多多顧慮：使得我撕了一封請你找房的信而另寫了那封邀你進城同看保雜茂　「亡命者」影片的信，你教課忙，抽不出空來，我沒法等你晤面商量了。在和那位專斷論者論戰了一場——其實我不　　丟？幾顆炸彈　之後，我再也不耐做那位學者底座上客，便急急地離開了那鬼窟來這山野了。你那兒是一個個人區，我去住　也恐不合適，而且恐怕妨礙了你。我所以決心來和這裏底　大的寂寞碰面。</p>
<p>來此已五日，房子却昨天　弄妥。前三天，過的簡直是野人生活：夜晚在星空之下，藤影樹影繞的院中小亭上支床睡覺，羣虫給我唱着催眠歌；早起到戶外的溪流中用冰涼的泉水洗漱，於是終是爬山逛廟……。在此出了房子太貴，吃飯亦貴。這本來不是我這樣的失業的流浪漢住的地方；但即來之則安之。今天我已購了一星期底糧食準備自己做飯了，袋中已　餘無幾呢。</p>
<p>我　此除借了一箱書來以外，遠帶了二百張稿　，我總要寫下一點我現在所能寫的。我爲此　不畏寂寞地來此，孤獨中我希望這枝筆是我底伴侶，我底愛人。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>祝福你底母親和你底孩子，謝謝他們念　我，替我吻她們。你不要過勞，望你快活！你如能抽身的話，你來看看你底孤獨的朋友吧。</p>
<h3>表兄弟</h3>
<p>— 草明女士</p>
<p>立興銀錢鋪底掌櫃梁永鴻給我底七哥的回信是這樣的：</p>
<p>……兄過埠（到外國去的意想）之壯志，弟閱悉之下，殊覺快慰，此後正可大展宏圖　。惟承命借欸一節，只以近日銀根短絀，實無從籌措應命，俟年關一過，再作圖謀如何？……」</p>
<p>七哥和梁永鴻在鄉里私塾念書的時候，是一對頂要好的朋友。後來分開了，他們底友誼還在他們底信裏相當地保持着的。</p>
<p>七哥把信遲給我，手臂盤到後腦那兒，眼睛反映出一層茫然的光輝。他一句話都不說，在我底狹隘的小房子裏密步走來走去，常常胸部幾乎碰到了牆壁，才醒覺地回過身來。</p>
<p>他已經是一個二十四歲的男人，全身有着野蠻的肌肉，他那長長的身段在這小房子里，越發顯得不適當了，好像他時時刻刻都有碰倒什麽笨重的傢具的可能。我呼喚他，安慰他，但他都沒有聽見，仿佛誰敲了他腦袋一下，使他陷入幾乎是昏厥那樣的狀態。</p>
<p>「你不要這樣傻信那滑頭底話」過了好久，他才憂鬱地對我說「我給他的信上不是寫明白，過了這個月就不行了嗎？過了年才跑去，正是淡月的季節，我去幹什麼呢？——而且，我這幾個月怎樣過法呢？……」</p>
<p>他那長臉上的大眼睛和寬闊的嘴巴，常常做出準備嚥下什麽痛苦的無言的表情。——他受殘酷播弄着的時候，便喜歡這樣做的。</p>
<p>不久，他就離開我這間小房子了。以後他每次來信給我看見的是一張不快活的，整天不知在計劃什麽似的臉。再也不像從前那樣每天興奮地作古正經地給我講他那間不設Number　One（頭目），把賺來的錢，三分二撥做工資的「理想的工廠」。他說他一聲將爲他這個近似小孩子那麼天真而有趣的理想而努力。</p>
<p>在鄉下的時候，他本來是一個有名橫蠻而好冒險的孩子。自從他到香港紅磡一間外國人管理的機器工廠裏學了四年師之後，脾氣却奇怪地變成倔強而沉鬱了，他差不多不願意用正面的話說出自己的本意。他底師傅，（我們底表哥）快到四十歲的瘦小的男人，曾經這樣對我批評七哥：</p>
<p>「和我吵，甚至動手打了我，也不要緊的，我怎麼會　恨一個還沒有懂事的表弟呢？但你須知那些No.1却要把我們當作一付機器看的，工人們對他們發生了一點點阻碍，他就得動手『修理』了！」他說話的態度和他做人一樣，穩健而遲緩，閱歷趕他底智慧進一個陰暗的角落。對每樣事他都有着過分的小心和憂慮，這點與七哥完全相反。</p>
<p>「七哥的失業，是證明我底話說對了的……現在，倒合該他到走運的時候了吧，暹　的工業比這裡好撈得多了——」</p>
<p>關於七哥的失業，他和他底師傅有過一個論爭，師傅說他被開除的主要原因，是因爲他底脾氣和那No.1底權力相抵觸的原故；但年輕人固執地說，根本因爲生意淡了，他們不需要那麼多人。</p>
<p>七哥常常傲慢地說他底師傅是個沒用的人。</p>
<p>「要是逃難的時候，他一定落到最後的一堆的……」他說。</p>
<p>「這種人並不算個壞人，有事他會做出很好的事來的，因爲牠沒有存心害別人！」我給我們地表哥辯護說。暹　去的計劃，舊曆十一月初旬就實現了。</p>
<p>他臨離開廣州那時的姿態，完全像個準備幹一件什麽快活的玩意兒的小孩子一樣。他底血管爲要表現自己的愉快和健壯，牠們都跳到皮層底下；他底動作不能像平時那樣平靜，手腳顯出過分的激昂，說話的聲音比平時雄亮而且豪放。爲了表示他底鎮靜，他故意裝出平淡，目前並沒有一回什麽事的樣子來安慰我：</p>
<p>「到那兒之後，只要我一拿到工錢，我就馬上給你寄點回來的。你現在隨人能夠自己養活自己，但我却擔心你底身體。你不要替特悶拼命，一個月裏歇他幾天工就好了。……」</p>
<p>關於七哥過暹　的旅費，在他離開中國之後，他底師傅才給我說明白。牠們底策略是這樣的：</p>
<p>七哥在接到立興掌櫃梁永鴻底信後不久，便在他面前取消到南洋去那個意見。大概過了半個月，他帶他底師傅——那時他扮作一個較體貼的小官僚——跑到梁永鴻那兒，用很確定的口氣說他們向禁烟局接洽了一宗投機生意，那是在第一個月便可獲一倍利益的，需要五百元股本，而他們現在剛缺少了三分之一的本錢……這樣，梁永鴻就勇敢地承認了這一個缺。</p>
<p>「七弟底話是對的。」那是小的男人緩慢地對我說。他用雙手抱住雙膝，蹲在床上，那沒有肉的鼻頭，不快活地呼吸着，他那神氣仿佛很痛苦的樣子。「行騙？他不承認這行爲的行騙「他不相信我的借約，而相信我底謊話，那有什麽辦法呢？但我相信，至多到半年或者一年，我們底友誼就可以恢復過來了。」啊，那年輕人！他像人熊那樣勇猛，我沒看過一個人像他那麼確信他自己所想的一切的。」他頓了一頓，使自己的精神更集中一點。「也許你們都以爲我是很懵懂，很愚蠢的人吧？其實我什麽不曉得呢，他底性格，他底慾望，但是，我是他底師傅，在廠里，我不能讓他闖出亂子來！……現在好了，等她獨自跑到一個生疏的國度里，創他自己的世界去吧！他臨走我吩咐了他許多話，但他都用輕易的笑來回答我了。——隨他去吧，年輕人沒有把額頭碰出血，怎會知道做人的滋味呢！……」</p>
<p>七哥去後的第二天，那穩重而憂鬱的熟手工人——我底表哥——便獨自悄然地回紅磡工廠去了。</p>
<p>七哥給我的第一封信，說他到暹　之後第一件出他意外的是那兒的工業比香港更衰落百倍。連比三角錢一天還要低的工作都沒法子找到，他和幾千幾萬人在工廠門外伸着脖子。他說他恐怕要改行了，並且鄭重地聲明：「我一輩子不發達就一輩子不回祖國——」他又說他如果找不到工作，就連信也願意給我們寫了。</p>
<p>這樣繼續了三年，我沒接到他底第二封信。（雖然後來他接了我們底表哥勸告和他給他寄的旅費，穿着破爛的衣服回來了。）現在我想起了他不寫信這件事也會莫名其妙地怨恨起他來的。</p>
<h3>微笑的死</h3>
<p>— 周木齋</p>
<p>死，在本人是無可挽回的悲哀，即使懦弱的自殺，激昂的從容就義，對旁人，除了仇視的有意，漠視的無意以外，也這樣。尤其是死懷抱某種信念，負有某種任務，對同樣或同情的人的死。無可挽回的根底，藏著心力未盡的隱痛。「鞠躬盡瘁，死而後己」，其實還是不得已也。在本人，具體的例子如遺囑，對旁人，具體的說明如「出師未捷身先死，長使英雄淚滿襟。」</p>
<p>然而高爾基的死，在本人可說是例外，是微笑的死。</p>
<p>看到勝利，看到走向成功，有齊軀的，有踏着足跡的，而且那樣廣泛，雖死，亦瞑目矣。</p>
<p>但這只限於在蘇聯。</p>
<p>而對於蘇聯，也還是損失，無可挽回的悲哀。別國更不用說了。</p>
<h3>一個春天</h3>
<p>— 江東</p>
<p>是一個秋天還是一個冬天．</p>
<p>絕早的清晨還像是淒涼的夜，</p>
<p>樹林內一堆堆的落葉好像墳，</p>
<p>被埋葬的小蟲還有最後的氣息。</p>
<p>是一個冬天還是一個春天。</p>
<p>雨樣的霧爽霧樣的雨封住一切。</p>
<p>迷路的小鳥躲在屋檐下驚慌地看着人，</p>
<p>到底耐不住，拍拍地飛去了一羣。</p>
<h3>照相外篇</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>我有兩個相識的人都是很喜歡玩照相。這兩個人的玩法可簡直不相同，一個是極喜歡拍自己的像的，他所照的片子裏十之八九都有他自己在內；另一個則極力避免拍自己的像，他根本不備自攝儀，有他的像的片子都是旁人代拍。這兩人遇到，每每爲他自己的癖好，加許多辯護的理由，但癖好大都並不是意識地養成的，因之那些辯護的理由，常都只是隨　湊付，自然這中間許確有一個極值探求的理由在下，而認拍相是一種藝術的人，更隨即會拉上些藝術理論來解決。但任何充分的理由，大概總不見得能使這二人之一，更變他的癖好。他自然未嘗不歡喜他所拍的照片能成爲藝術品，而這如要付出犧牲自己的癖好爲代價，可就不幹。反正不把照相看作藝術而看作娛樂，是一般所容許的，那末照舊玩下去就是了。</p>
<p>照片儘可以拍出來只給自己一個人看，和旁人不發生一點關係，所以把拍照當作娛樂，可以不致引起人的非難。或者努力於爭取拍照的藝術的地位的人，未免要感到如果大家都抱這娛樂的態度而拍照，將對於拍照的成爲藝術，頗有妨碍。可是爲藝術而拍照的人，其所得的結果，或竟同於爲營業而拍照的。營業者有種種的技巧，以求得營業上的滿意，但其作品往往還不及業餘者或有的美妙成就的使照相者愛好。因是到現在照相商及乎只能以拍半身照放大照爲其營業。藝術照家，若處處顧到藝術條件，未必不弄到除供給作在專家之間，做互相標榜的資料以外，別無用處的地步。將來果有不朽的照相傑作，有許多恐不免還是出自玩玩者之手。自然那時的玩玩者，勢不能保持玩玩者之名，而是硬得頂上藝術家的頭銜了。</p>
<p>把玩玩的成績期許得太高，正本的藝術家當然要大生其氣。但幸好是關於照相，無論怎樣反轉來把玩玩的態度駡得如何要不得，惡劣的照片，縱惡劣也要惡劣不到成爲毒害。我們固然不必借遊戲是藝術的原始精神的話，爲玩玩　讃，但玩玩也決不能誣爲必帶不正當的目的。只要玩是如小孩子的玩一樣認真，則玩的意義也是相當嚴肅的。能承認這相當的嚴肅，在照相在機件的限度之內，當然差不到多遠。可惜別種藝術，都沒有一巧妙的機械，作基本的決定，因得天高地下。在一派形成勢力，儼居正統的時候，必定造成許多冤獄，而等後來的藝術史家，再爲之平反。每一時代的藝術史家，幾乎都只是在平反冤獄做工夫。但我們知道，無論平反到怎樣地步，正統派總還是先成爲研究的目標，因此每時代總不缺乏力爭正統的藝術家。拍照片上的拍自己或不拍自己問題，若放在別的藝術方面，也許會成爲一代的爭執的中心。中國山水畫中的宜不宜加人物問題，就與這很接近。誠然，山水畫中的一個人物，往往足以牽動全畫的氣韻，而照片中的如實的自然，絕不爲一個人物的增減而有所改變，這　很足爲成問題不成問題的原因，可是問題也儘有一直牽到不成問題的範圍以內的。到這裏，我又希望拍照不要成爲藝術。</p>
<p>說過，是我有兩個相識的人很喜歡玩照相。自己是對於這項技能，連學也還沒有想學，這得聲明，一面熱腸古道之士爲我擔憂將因固執玩玩的態度而陷於如何的墮落。若問自己雖不致受害，可怕不怕貽害於人？這是不怕的，我即以爲玩玩照相者還不會因藝術者的理論改變他的癖好，則上面的說法，自更不致引藝術派的動搖，而玩玩者既已有其癖好爲其基本理由，則有沒有上一說法，都毫無關係。那末來說這一套空話是又何苦呢？這裏倒可以把玩玩拉來　織罪狀。通常人是喜歡談他所不大了解的事的。並且照相也常不免和我們發生關係，我們很有機會碰到一個玩玩的拍照者，及一個藝術的拍照者。而要我們變成玩的對象，或藝術的對象。我們這個對象既然是人，自然不免其反射作用。我們既不能像西學初來時的人，以怕攝去元神而拒絕拍照，而又不能接受拍照可以出去晦氣的新迷信而歡迎拍照。對於僅是玩玩的拍照者，則我不高興玩，就僅可以回覆他一個不，若高興，則聽憑他和拍貓拍狗一樣地玩，也只和被呼馬呼牛一樣地無所謂。對於藝術的拍照者，却不能如此簡單。也許他起意爲我一類夠做模特兒的資格。這資格　表現後既無法否認說不是我，也無法聲明未得同意。作者照例可以對對象不負責，而對象却不能擺脫作者的牽涉。我們如果曾在一些書報上看見某一種題照片而覺得寒心，對於藝術的拍照者就不免有點侷促。</p>
<p>作希有的偉大藝術家的模特兒，常是一種非凡的榮譽。蕭伯納請羅丹雕他自己的像，赫里斯就稱他是決定聰明，知道自己的成就便不夠永久流傳，也能憑羅丹不朽下去。鄧肯得知羅丹有意爲他造像，也非常歡喜，而對於將於不會有機會實現深致惋惜。此外希冀萬一被羅丹選中作模特兒的平常人，當更不知有多少。或者也有不敢希望到羅丹，而只向次於羅丹，乃至萬一可成爲羅丹的藝術家希望的吧。但離羅丹愈遠的藝術家，恐怕到正以爲自己很像羅丹，而在自己的給人造像，看作是給人以很大的榮譽。這種榮譽要接受　真受不了。不幸榮譽竟變爲諷刺，　還是自己的臉相生得不好。克斯妥納向歌德申辯阿爾伯被寫得太壞，雖被公認為無識，實在倒是很聰明的，既知道阿爾伯是它的影子這件事的必被探求，則那申辯確是必要的。文人筆底下寫出的醜態，認作是別人自己的疤痕，　不多已成無可爭執之論，何　照片所拍，必得是「正身無訛」呢？然而拍照的藝術家中，又竟有不求形似，只求傳神那末一派。這神也就是那「元神」之神吧！這樣，我除對照相藏起鬼臉，另外就又只是希望拍照不要成爲藝術。</p>
<h3>夜市</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>這裏是北平的西單大街。北平雖然是一座古城，　西單大街仿佛是被上了進來的罩衫和原有的街道稍有不同，若是真想發掘北平的古色，論街道先要到塵土飛揚的小胡同中去尋找。西單大街很顯然地是吸收了中國以外的文明。這裏的街道也鋪着柏油，上面陳設着電車道，商鋪的門面裝飾有些是立體式的，入夜以後霓虹燈放出紅蘭的耀眼顏色。大拍賣，全部貨物大放盤的廣告隨處皆是，小汽車往來不停，這正是近代都市的街道。</p>
<p>西單大街是熱鬧的，因爲這裏有一個商場，商場裏除了比櫛的商鋪外，另外還有電影院，雜技場，大鼓書場等等娛樂地方，是極易勾引往遊人的腳步的：到晚上，雖然雜技場關了門，却比白天更熱鬧，從商場外沿大街路東一直到西單牌樓，一處挨一處地擺出一些地灘來，這就是所謂「夜市」，——特別比白天熱鬧的原業。行人在灘中擠着，有的閑逛，有的揀選着可　的貨物。</p>
<p>最近以來，夜市上特別添了好多賤貨，像設麼富士綢××紗，灘子前堆得高高的，成色好，價錢巧，一角多錢買一尺，多多便宜！買一尺自由布還要二角多。自然人人全都喜歡買些便宜東西，不用攤主人大聲喊賣，已經是顧客盈攤應接不暇了。</p>
<p>還有些電鍍的剪刀叉勺之類日用品，比起當地手工業的產品，要賤上好幾倍；東西既然精巧，使用起來又非常方便，只有傻子他才不喜歡購買。就以我自己來說，因爲耐不住賤價的誘惑，也買了一把小洋刀。這把刀，可以裁紙，可以削水菓皮，又光又亮，才只化了兩角錢：這不是我本人外行，內行人只消八分錢就可以買到了。這種東西在上海時，最普通的也要五六角錢。總之，因爲這是私貨，所以就便宜。</p>
<p>賣酸梅湯的人是入夏以來新上市的買賣，一大枚喝兩杯，大吵大喊的招攬主客，洋車夫帶着滿身滿臉的汗水，把車子停下，就丟過去一兩個大枚，解一解熱，解一解口渴。有時嫌不太涼，還要加上一點雪花落。孩子們的足跡常常在這帶地方留着，眼望別人的口福，自己往嗓子裏嚥着唾液。</p>
<p>水菓担的買賣不大好，香蕉爛得一片黑，不見有一主顧；杏子分成一堆一堆的，五大枚一堆十大枚的堆的全有；櫻桃已經要爛了，黃的梨更是一塊黑着一塊爛的一斤二斤購買的主顧真不多有。</p>
<p>是粽子上市的時候，這種食品的買賣可不壞，而且還放在冰堆裏冰着，清涼可口，大可一消熱意。一個一個賣凈了，一串一串賣完了，掌櫃的臉上伏着喜色，把剩下的竹葉好生收留起來，預備明天再裹。</p>
<p>賣鮮花和　塊的沒有生意，正像那新出爐的燒餅少有人光顧的一樣，輕易留不住路人的腳步。</p>
<p>最有意味的是小書攤，一些　，全很舊，淩亂擺在那裏，大多數是鴛鴦蝴蝶派的言情醒世等類的章回小說，但偶然也可以發現到一兩本絕版或禁賣的書籍，在你得之如獲珍寶，攤主人却於不知覺中賣了個大特廉價。有時，正可以化上八大枚，買上一本九角五分美金的西文書。</p>
<p>草帽攤，綫襪攤，多少有些主顧，應時的貨品總有小路。賣扇子的也有些主顧光臨。</p>
<p>最厭人的是洋車夫，看你一走下人行路，爭着搶着兜生意：「坐車走吧？拉你去。到那兒去呀？」你儘管搖頭，他們還纏個不休，擋着你的去路，只要你說出地方來，他們就一擁而起討着價錢；「一毛錢，——四十枚，——三十枚——二十八枚——」自己討完自己跌價，十二枚的買賣他們也拉，合算大洋還不到三分錢，但上海的黃包車夫是不會拉九銅板的買賣的。</p>
<p>汽車電車奔馳着，吵雜的聲浪，人的潮在夜市中蕩動着，直到午夜時分，才可以停止了車的奔馳，人的動和貨物的交易。</p>
<h3>蓓蕾</h3>
<p>— 華蕊</p>
<p>這成熟了的蓓蕾怒放了，</p>
<p>明晨，牠吸收着濕潤的珠露，</p>
<p>微笑地迎接着美麗的太陽。</p>
<p>雖然暴風雨襲擊過，</p>
<p>那無情的荒土，</p>
<p>埋葬過飄落的花瓣，</p>
<p>可是，者蓓蕾終又開花了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>無錫僧眾要受急救訓練</h3>
<p>— 家為</p>
<p>這是據昨日的報載說：無錫縣當局，為使全縣佛敎徒應付非常時期起見，擬舉辦僧眾急救訓練班，卽令佛敎淨業社籌備組織。昨日該社特召集全縣寺院住持僧開會，出席者數人，討論通過僧眾急救訓練大鋼，凡十八歲至四十歲之僧徒，一律須受急救訓練。訓練時期暫定三個月，擔任訓練醫師，由城區各醫院醫師擔任，一俟籌備就緒，卽可開始訓練云。</p>
<p>這或許是個差強人意的事吧。佛敎之在中國社會層中本是有著根深蒂固的歷史在的。歷來「出家人」的為僧為尼，上山入林，原是為了「看破紅塵」，目為「四大皆空」的。他們本慈悲之懷，願超渡眾生；但是他們旣隱得山林，入得寺廟，但願修得「清身」，入得「天堂」為神為為仙了，那還得得世間俗事，芸芸眾生呢？正如士大夫們的終日坐「苦雨齊」吃苦茶而談狐說鬼，管不得什麼「宇宙」與「蒼蠅」一樣。可是他們雖然有着一個超人的「性靈」，却終還得有個肉體的軀穀；而這軀體正與俗人一樣，終超越不了天然的環境與人類的集體——社會會。</p>
<p>本來，誰敢吾認，他們正與平常一樣的是「人」，是代表着人類社會的某一階層。所以，在今日，在民族的危機一天迫緊一天，而大衆的生一天緊促一天的生死關頭，事實很彰明的指示着我門，不是抗戰求生，就是滅亡！所以，在全國上下一致抗敵的救亡陣錢上，不論他是農，工，商，學，兵，以至曾，尼…只要是不願作亡國奴的人們，都應得負起他們救亡的神聖責任來。所以，今日無錫當局的籌備組織僧衆，授以非常時的急救訓練，正也是今日抗敵救亡準備中値得注意的工作之一。</p>
<p>不是嗎。據本月十日各報載中國佛敎理事會發表全國寺廟與僧尼的統計：全國大小寺廟庵院共有二十六萬七千餘所，僧尼計有七十三萬八千餘人之多：而四川，河南，江西，安徽，湖南等諸省尙未算入。在這裏，我們姑不用論及他們宗敎的立塲與信仰以至與今日社會的關係；然而在今日這個有生死出入的情境之下，要是這數十萬「超俗的」羣衆，也能與無錫僧衆那樣負起非常時期的責任來，那末尙不是我們抗敵之陣綫中的一支助軍呢！「有一分力量，儘一分責任」，這是在非常時期的人們所不可少的信心與責任，為民族的獨立而奮鬥，為大衆的自由而犧牲！起來吧，不願做奴隷的人們！</p>
<h3>冷水浴（續）</h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>在鄉下，洗冷水浴的時候正是忙於脫棉花的時候。我在撥開蘆葦入水時，常常要給父母看見。允其使我害怕的是母親，她板着臉拿着　頭作倒我的形狀，於是我維有聽她的命令爬上岸來。在這情形下過了許多决，我終於學會洗冷水浴了，我不但能够游，而且能「入沒頭項」，（將頭沒入水底游）這對我有無上的愉快，同時也有了對付母親的方法。譬如母親拿着耜頭要打我的時候，我便迅捷地全身沒下水底去，不一會我却在遠遠的別一處冒起頭來了。待母親再趕來時，我又全身沒下水底去，不一會我又在遠遠的別一處冒起頭來了。這樣，母親面上雖帶着怒氣，但由於心的欣喜禁不住地笑起來了。於是我也笑了，我佩服我自己的本領。過後，母親覺得不會有什麽危險，所以也不來管我了。</p>
<p>在夏天，從蟬子剛唱起來的時候直到蟬子聲音沒了的時候，我幾乎整天浸在水裏的。兩手撥水，身體從水中滑前去的時候，這愉快是難於言論的。吃了晚飯坐在院子裏，沒有一些風，呆看着頭頂上的月亮，蚊蟲緊圍在身旁汗珠從皮膚裏一粒一粒滲出來，於是悄悄的邀了同伴浸到水裏去。衝破水裏的月亮成閃爍不定的銀鍊子。脚動起來，浪花四濺，給月亮照着，浪花也成銀色了。立在水中看水面漸漸平靜下來，月亮也很穩的躲在水底，將自己的頭偏側一點，於是頭的影子分明地印在水上。這種種情趣，都市上的游泳者是不會知道的，只有鄉下的野孩子纔能享受得到。都市的游泳池有錢者纔能走進去，鄕下河溝中的冷水浴只要一條身子，一點技術却是誰都可以享受的。</p>
<p>每天在校門前的闊大的溝裏，看見許多野孩子在洗冷水浴，我常常想起孩子時代。如今這種生活已遠離我了，我看見着這些後一輩的孩子只有一些輕微的感傷襲擊着我。夏天到了，我恰巧又在鄉下，我定要洗冷水浴，我要溫我的舊夢…</p>

<h3>President Chiang Kai-shek's Policy for Handling the Two Guang Provinces: The Central Government Persistently Implements a Policy of Peaceful Unification, Hoping That All Provinces Will Follow the Proper Path and Support the Central Government. If the Two Guang Provinces Submit, Past Offenses Will Not Be Pursued.</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 25th, a reporter, noting the cross-border military advances by the Two Guang provinces into neighboring provinces and the still chaotic situation, paid a special visit to President Chiang Kai-shek to inquire about the policy for handling this matter. The President's response was as follows: The governance and survival of the Chinese nation are not only of deep concern to our 400 million compatriots but also attract the attention of all countries in the world. However, the determination of survival does not depend solely on the international situation; we must not forget the responsibility for the governance of China itself. As the ancients said, "A nation must first be attacked from within before it is attacked from without." People with ambition and drive can overcome difficulties and work together to overcome this crisis, even in difficult circumstances. If, in the midst of these frightening storms, we further engage in internal strife and even conflict, the more effort we put in to dissuade, the greater the harm will be. If the ship breaks and the vessel sinks, leading to mutual destruction, it will bring eternal condemnation without benefiting the nation. At this critical juncture of survival, our responsibility to protect the nation becomes even greater. The Central Government will adhere to its policy of internal peace and unification to the end. We sincerely hope that compatriots across the country will share this understanding, cooperate wholeheartedly, and fulfill their national duties. China should be a unified nation. Since ancient times, unification has brought harmony, mutual assistance, national prosperity, and peace, while disunity has led to internal strife and popular distress. Past lessons are clear and consistent. Therefore, the central government must take overall responsibility for all national administration that requires unified management and will never abandon this duty. However, within a unified nation, there is ample possibility to respect local conditions. The customs and habits of each province differ. While efforts should be made to ensure consistency in various administrative matters, attention should also be paid to local circumstances. The Central Government is extremely willing to engage in open and sincere consultations with the provinces to strive for the best solutions and is also willing to assist with human and financial resources to promote development. However, all policies should be based solely on the overall interests of the entire nation, without any personal biases involved. We hope that people from all provinces will also deeply recognize that the national spirit must be united, and discipline must be maintained. The Central Government seeks unification through peaceful means, and each province should follow the proper path, support the Central Government, consolidate the foundation of our nation, and enhance the status of our people. The governance of the nation and the strength of the military are different, but improving military discipline and unifying military orders are the key to the survival of the nation. All military actions across the country should obey the orders of the highest central authority, which determines national policy, without any freedom of action. Only in this way can local areas be governed well and the nation have strength. If any part of the country has opinions on national affairs, they must be discussed openly and peacefully and cannot act freely, causing disputes. Recently, the Guangdong and Guangxi armies have entered the provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, and Fujian without authorization, failing to comply with this principle, which is regrettable. However, I still firmly believe that the officers and soldiers of the Two Guang provinces have a long-standing patriotic spirit and, after some consideration, will respect the will of the Central Government, follow the proper path, and work together for the nation. If they can do so, I will treat them with sincerity and impartiality, without pursuing past offenses and without ordering other provincial armies to enter Guangdong and Guangxi. I sincerely and frankly seek a sincere and loyal response from the authorities in the Two Guang provinces. As for my personal attitude, people of understanding in the country will surely understand without the need for further explanation. The nation is in crisis, and I have been entrusted with important responsibilities by the Party, the country, and the people. I will certainly strive to use my knowledge and abilities to overcome obstacles and fulfill my responsibilities for the life of the nation and the future of the people. I have previously stated that I do not wish to be a candidate for president, and I can also state that I do not seek any personal glory or benefit. I only wish to lead comrades and compatriots across the country, without fearing hardship, to lay a solid foundation for the Republic of China. I also hope that this will be the common goal of all comrades and compatriots in our country. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Beijing Groups Telegraph, Requesting the Central Government to Punish Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 25th, various groups in Beijing sent a telegram to the entire nation, stating: (Omitted titles) We have recently sent a telegram to the Central Government, which reads: Since the disturbances in Guangdong and Guangxi, the Central Government has shown great tolerance out of a sincere desire to save the country, without imposing punishment, and has repeatedly telegraphed orders to wait for instructions and not fall into the enemy's trap of using Chinese to control Chinese. The people of the entire nation have also been running around appealing, urging them not to act on personal impulses and ruin the nation's last chance of survival. The generals of Guangdong and Guangxi should have profoundly awakened, reined in their horses at the edge of the cliff, observed the law, and shared the sense of impending doom. Instead, they harbored secret schemes and had other plans, feigning withdrawal while actually changing course and advancing north, invading the borders of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces. According to reports from both Chinese and foreign media in recent days, they have become even more extreme, arbitrarily organizing a so-called Military Commission. Chen Jitang and Li Zongren have assumed the positions of Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong-Guangxi Allied Army, and the Guangxi army in Qiyang and Hengzhou in Hunan Province has begun attacking the local garrison. The situation is dangerous, and their lack of remorse is evident. Colluding with the enemy, acting as their accomplices, disregarding the survival of the nation and the people, using false pretenses to raise troops and create unrest, and undermining peaceful unification are acts of extreme depravity. National law and party discipline cannot tolerate such actions. In order to eliminate rebellion and safeguard the survival of the nation, we can only telegraph your committee, requesting that you immediately issue an order for punishment to uphold the law and save the country from danger. We eagerly await your response. The Nanjing Municipal Farmers' Association, Workers' Welfare Committee, Chamber of Commerce, and Women's Association respectfully request.

The original telegram reads: To Gentlemen Bo Nan, De Lin, and Jian Sheng: The national crisis is urgent. If we engage in internal strife again, it will be self-destruction.

It was originally heading to East Africa to supply the army. However, after arriving at Gibraltar, the Italian army had occupied the territory, and no one claimed the shipment.

<h3>Japan Seeks to Occupy Nanao Island</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese are plotting to occupy Nanao Island, located on the border between Fujian and Guangdong, as a base for southern aggression. The Fujian and Guangdong authorities telegraphed the National Government to send warships to defend it and establish it as a county. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to certain sources, Japan is invading Nanao Island with the intention of constructing a naval port to control South China and encroach on Chaoshan, as well as to compete with the inherent commercial interests of the United Kingdom and the United States in the South Pacific. This plan has been brewing for a long time, and recently, it has become even more active. A few days ago, the military authorities in Taiwan sent a survey team of more than ten people to survey the depth and breadth of the seabed around the island. It is also heard that the Taiwan authorities have allocated substantial funds as subsidies for the island's fishermen to relocate to Taiwan. It is understood that about 70% of the island's fishermen have already emigrated to northern Taiwan one after another, lured by the Japanese, due to the sluggish fishing industry and difficult living conditions in recent years. The intention of the Japanese is nothing more than to seize the fishing rights of the island and monopolize the Chaoshan fish market. Nanao Island is located more than ten nautical miles from Shantou, close to Taiwan, and is the gateway to Chaoshan. At a time when the Japanese Naval Ministry is establishing a southward policy and a large number of warships are cruising off the coast of Fujian Province to demonstrate, the Chinese people cannot ignore this.

<h3>Seeing Off the Delegation Participating in the World Games</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The 11th World Games will open on August 1 in Berlin, Germany. Our country's delegation includes athletes, staff, and inspection personnel, totaling over a hundred people. Apart from the football team, which has already departed in advance, the remaining members, led by Secretary-General Shen Silang, will leave today on the Italian ship Conte Verde to compete far away. We will display our military prowess abroad and strive for glory in a foreign land. The people of the entire nation are placing great expectations on these athletes who bear such important missions.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, our country has considered martial spirit important, listing archery and horsemanship among the six arts and using hunting to practice skills. We have always relied on the principle of the need for both civil and martial virtues to achieve a harmonious balance. Although the implementation steps may have been somewhat skewed, the intention of valuing physical fitness remains the same today. Later, the morals of the people gradually declined, and they turned to weakness. They compared civil virtues to rich food and treated martial virtues as bitter medicine. Gradually, the situation deteriorated, and it became difficult to reverse the trend. The national strength declined, and foreign insults became more frequent. Some people tried to correct the mistakes early on. In the past twenty years, the atmosphere has changed greatly. The gentry and commoners throughout the country have been able to focus on the development of sports in order to adapt to the global trend. Various sports have progressed year by year, and finally, we have today's participation in the World Games. The World Games have now been held eleven times, and we have not heard of any formal Chinese delegation participating in the past ten sessions. Even in the previous four-year conference, our country had only one athlete. The criticism of being backward has been difficult to shake off for a long time. Unexpectedly, after four years of preparation, we were able to leap onto the stage. This is indeed a great effect of the efforts of the athletes in the country in recent years and a turning point in the fortunes of the country.</p>
<p>When the delegation participating in the World Games went to Beijing to receive the flag the other day, President Chiang gave an earnest speech. The main points of the speech were: "The success or failure of your participation in the World Games is of no great importance. The most important thing is to show the world the inherent spirit of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor of our nation. If morality is lacking and the spirit is decadent, then victory in competition is still a shame and a failure. If morality is undamaged and the spirit is noble, then defeat in competition is still glorious and victorious." The inherent spirit of our nation is often misunderstood by foreigners, and malicious rumors are prone to spread misunderstanding. This time, we have the opportunity to fully express the beautiful virtues inherent in our people through competition, so that representatives from all countries have a clear understanding and maintain a good impression. Even if the competition is lost, this trip is still worthwhile. In addition to encouragement, President Chiang's words also have a deeper meaning. Because our country is participating in the World Games for the first time and experience and equipment are not as good as others, he is deeply concerned that a setback will discourage the brave. Therefore, he makes a pre-emptive explanation to adjust the trend of thought, hoping that we will view the World Games delegation as being able to double the spirit of aggression when hearing this incisive and reasonable statement. Even like a newly forged sword, it actually holds the meaning of condensing secrecy. And with strong enemies in front, always keep a sense of caution. We look forward to the future without any slackness. If we compare it to an old horse lying in the stall in the past, then in the future, it will be a tiger cub out of the cage. Predicting the results of this trip, the evaluation of shocking the world may not be an extravagant hope. Why should we belittle ourselves? Go ahead, everyone, good luck on your journey.</p>
<h3>The Sasaki Case; The British Court Continues the Trial</h3>
<p>(Beiping) When the British Consulate court investigating the death of Sasaki opened this morning, it could not proceed because the Japanese authorities did not order witnesses to appear in court. After questioning two Chinese waiters from the bar, the court adjourned for a short time to await an explanation from the Japanese authorities. The court reopened at 12:15 PM. Royal Counsel Pula Aite Wu stated that he was currently unable to proceed and requested an extension of the hearing until the afternoon, at which time he hoped to be able to summon other witnesses. Thereupon, the presiding officer announced an adjournment. During the two hearings today, no personnel from the Japanese Embassy or Japanese reporters were present. It is generally believed that the Japanese are now engaged in resisting the investigation. However, officials from the Japanese Embassy and two witnesses appeared at the third hearing in the afternoon but did not explain the reason for their absence in the morning. Then, a Korean waitress from the bar was questioned. According to her testimony, on the night of May 25, while she was serving tea with a Japanese customer in the room, two British soldiers suddenly broke in. She recognized the two as Kirk and Hunt. After Kirk entered the room, he hit the Japanese customer on the forehead. She saw blood flowing on the customer's face, and she ran out of the bar with others. After returning to the room shortly after, she bandaged the customer's wound. She often saw Kirk Teint three or four times a month, so she recognized him at a glance. Another Korean waitress was then questioned. According to her testimony, two British soldiers went to her bar twice on the night of May 26 at 11:00 PM and 12:00 AM. The presiding officer asked her if she recognized the two. The waitress immediately pointed to Kirk and Barry, who was acquitted yesterday, and also said that when the two first arrived, they had looked into each room, and the second time they only passed through the hall and did not cause any trouble. After the testimony was completed, she left the court, and it was decided to continue the hearing tomorrow morning. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Officials recently stated that two British soldiers have been implicated in the case of the Japanese military officer Sasaki being beaten to death in Beiping, China. The British consular court in Beiping is currently conducting an investigation in order to get to the bottom of the matter. As for the news published by a certain newspaper that the court is about to indict the soldiers with assassination or murder, it is not an accurate statement. The court has no right to file a public prosecution, and its task is only to investigate the case. This is because the Japanese accuse the British soldiers of a crime. If the consular court accepts it, the case can constitute murder. But officials believe that the Japanese accusations against the British soldiers are difficult to establish. Even if it is established, it should be tried by the British court, because only the British court has the right to try British citizens. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The trial of the Japanese military officer Sasaki's murder case was opened in the British Embassy on the 24th. On that day, the court did not conduct any questioning of the three British soldiers. The questioning of dozens of Japanese and Korean witnesses regarding the circumstances of the incident took a long time. Moreover, the judge did not allow the witnesses to sit down during this long questioning. Japanese residents were angry at the British attitude, saying that the trial was insincere and planned to ask the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to file a protest with the British government.

<h3>The "Daiei Maru" Incident: Japan Issues Another Statement; Hsu Li-a Sincerely Explains the Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 3:00 PM on the 24th, Lieutenant Colonel Kubota, the Japanese naval attaché stationed in Tianjin, visited Hsu Li-a, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, to lodge a verbal protest regarding the "Daiei Maru" incident. On the morning of the 25th, a statement was published in the Japanese newspaper, alleging that customs patrol boats exceeded their authority in anti-smuggling operations, unlawfully fired upon Japanese ships, insulted the Japanese flag, and injured unarmed Japanese sailors. It stated that in order to protect the lives and property of Japanese residents and maritime safety in the future, the actions of customs patrol boats would be closely monitored, and if necessary, warships from Lushun would be dispatched to patrol outside Dagu Port. The wording was particularly severe. The Tianjin Customs has telegraphed the Shanghai Inspector General of Customs for instructions. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>The Montreux Conference: Draft New Convention Passes First Reading; Meeting Adjourned until after the League of Nations Meeting; Soviet Union's Demands Gain Support from Three Countries; Only Japan Opposes at Present</h3>
<p>Montreux: The Montreux Conference continued its meeting this morning and passed the first reading of the draft new convention proposed by Turkey. Article 9 of the draft stipulates that warships of all countries wishing to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits shall obtain the permission of the Turkish government in advance and shall also notify the League of Nations. During the discussion of this case, the Japanese representative, Ambassador Sato to France, rose to speak, saying that in addition to obtaining the permission of the Turkish government, it was sufficient to notify the other signatory countries and that there was no need to notify the League of Nations. The chairman, Bruce, the Australian Commonwealth Special Envoy to England, said that since the new convention had to be registered with the League of Nations, the notification procedure was necessary. Sato replied that Japan's final position on this matter would be explained at the next meeting. The meeting was then adjourned until after the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council meeting were concluded. The French representative, former Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu, flew back to Paris after the meeting so that he could attend the French Senate's discussion of foreign policy. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Montreal: The Soviet Russian representative's request to allow Soviet Russian warships in the Black Sea to freely enter and leave the straits, which was made during the conference considering Turkey's request to amend the Dardanelles Straits Convention, is now supported by Turkey, Romania, and France, according to various opinions. Among the great powers, only Japan opposes it so far. It is expected that Bulgaria will also oppose it, while Yugoslavia will demand that all countries enjoy equal rights in the straits. Unexpectedly, Ciano will represent Italy at the conference after the sanctions are lifted. It is expected here that Ciano will also strongly oppose the demands of Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov. The conference will be adjourned today until after the special session of the League of Nations General Assembly concludes. Soviet Russian representative Litvinov reiterated yesterday at the plenary meeting the Soviet Russian request for special treatment. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Montreal: At today's plenary session of the Dardanelles Straits Conference, Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov reiterated the request for special treatment. Litvinov suggested that the clause prohibiting submarines from passing through the straits should also apply to aircraft carriers. French delegate Peng Gu advocated allowing countries fulfilling their obligations under the League of Nations Covenant to have greater freedom to pass through the straits. Japanese delegate Sato stated that Japan was prepared to accept the restrictions on warships sailing to the Black Sea if they were also applied to warships leaving the Black Sea. British delegate Stanhope reserved his opinion on Turkey's suggestion to limit the tonnage of warships passing through the straits to 14,000 tons. Turkish delegate Rushdi said that the Turkish government did not insist on this figure and would consider reasonable amendments. Litvinov proposed an amendment to the French suggestion to allow warships of belligerent countries to pass through the straits when fulfilling obligations under the League of Nations Covenant or under agreements concluded within the League of Nations framework, but agreed to make changes at Peng Gu's request. All discussions will continue tomorrow, but the plenary session will have to be convened after the League of Nations General Assembly is held. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>The Positions of Various Countries Are Clearly Defined</h3>
<p>Montreux, Switzerland: A special dispatch from our diplomatic correspondent states that the Montreux Conference has been in session for three days. Looking back at the past three days, the positions of the countries involved are now clearly visible. They are described below:</p>
<p>First, judging from the draft new convention proposed by Turkey, it can be seen that Turkey and Russia have the same objective, which is to restrict the free navigation of the Dardanelles and Bosphorus straits, so as to effectively blockade the Black Sea and prevent countries that are not Black Sea littoral states from entering and leaving at will. In this regard, Soviet Russian Foreign Commissar Litvinov spoke eloquently at the conference, and his words were exactly the same as those of the Soviet representative at the 1923 Lausanne Conference. In Russia's view, the geographical situation of the Black Sea should be given special attention. On the one hand, its gateway must be blockaded to prevent warships of countries that are not Black Sea littoral states from entering. On the other hand, this narrow strip of water should be reserved as a free passage for the fleets of Black Sea littoral states. This is the country's traditional policy, and Litvinov's words are intended to inherit the legacy of his predecessors and reiterate it. Romania is also a Black Sea littoral state and naturally has the same sympathy. Therefore, Foreign Minister Titulescu of that country has vigorously supported the views of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Second, as far as Britain and Italy are concerned, the two countries are quite close to each other at the Montreux Conference. According to recent statistics, the total tonnage of Italian merchant ships passing through the two straits ranks first among all countries. If free navigation is restricted, Italy will suffer a hundred disadvantages without a single benefit. In Britain, the proposal to strictly regulate and restrict navigation is also opposed, and the establishment of a special system to benefit the Soviet Russian navy is like a thorn in its side and cannot be agreed to. Britain and Italy have the same interests, so they exchanged friendly glances and felt mutually sympathetic. However, up to now, Britain has expressed dissent internally, but externally it has only put forward reservations of a general nature and has not hastily determined its position. Its attitude is obviously to wait for Italy to express itself on the following two points: 1. The Soviet Union should not enjoy special privileges regarding navigation of the two straits. 2. Japan is currently not a member of the League of Nations and should not be allowed to restore any relationship with the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Third, judging from the remarks made by the French representative Peng Gu yesterday, it can be seen that France does not want to oppose the views of Russia and Turkey, but believes that if some countries have an obligation to go to war for common purposes in the future due to regional mutual assistance agreements or League of Nations resolutions, they must have the right to freely pass through the two straits, whether in wartime or peacetime, and must not be restricted in any way. The French position is viewed by Premier Léon Blum and Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos of the cabinet as follows:</p>
<p>In terms of quantity, Japan aims to ensure the security of its national defense in an unrestricted state and ensure complete freedom in terms of quality, and should prepare effective armaments suitable for its national conditions. From this point of view, it was decided not to participate in the treaty. As for the legal aspect, it is natural not to comply with the oath in fact. Because the Imperial Navy did not participate, the U.S. Navy resumed the 16-inch matter, which is a natural consequence of the provisions of the treaty. It is also said that after receiving the official reply from the Imperial Government, the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France, will begin deliberations. Now that there is no need for the three countries to deliberate, the situation when Japan and Italy do not participate in the new treaty is anticipated and codified, so it does not seem to be a problem.

<h3>Important Speech by the British First Lord of the Admiralty: Stresses Strengthening Naval Power; Fulfills Responsibility for Collective Security; Learns Two Lessons from Past Experience; Expresses Sympathy for Anglo-American Cooperation</h3>
<p>(London) First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare said in a speech at the Royal Empire Society tonight that some people think that war is inevitable, which is a guilty and foolish thought. However, Europe is now full of flammable fuel. Although no country wants to declare war, if powerful countries like Great Britain do not have military strength sufficient to make their power felt in the pursuit of peace, then a spark can turn into a prairie fire. For this reason, the British government must once again do its best to speed up the British naval program. If the British army, navy, and air force can be properly strengthened in time, then there will be no world war. Hoare went on to say that in the midst of the changes caused by air power, we can create a fleet commensurate with our strength, which can defeat the enemy and open the seas, and can sail to any place to fulfill its three major responsibilities, namely, the protection of cruising transport. The naval staff and I are never so foolish as to say that our defenses are sufficient to cope with attacks and have more than enough. But if someone asks if the advent of air power has changed the navy's mission and we cannot create a fleet that can fulfill its traditional responsibilities, I will answer "yes." My advisors and I are determined to make full use of air power to build this fleet, so that the new fleet can be in a superior position and become the most easily mobilized peace force in the world. We have learned two lessons from the past six months. One is the practical application of collective security, namely, the British fleet permanently stationed in the Mediterranean. The British fleet and collective security are two in one and one in two. Although the British fleet in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea did not have the convenience of mobilization and did not make careful preparations, it was able to fulfill its entrusted responsibilities faithfully and effectively in dealing with the worries of disturbance, the stagnation of international affairs, and the danger of delay, and its prevention of the spread of the Italo-Abyssinian War can be said to have been completely responsible and without regret. The second lesson is that in theory, the military strength of 50 countries is invincible, but in practice, the value of this military strength depends entirely on whether each country is not only willing to go to war with the aggressor, but also prepared to fight with the aggressor when it attacks. Among the member states of the League of Nations, only Great Britain is prepared to do this, and even to make effective preparations. In today's state of world public opinion, can Great Britain think that it can rely on the cooperation and assistance of distant countries and those whose main countries are not members of the League of Nations? All these lessons show that the League of Nations' reliance on Britain's powerful navy is one of the major elements of peace, which is no different from the world in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the failure to realize collective military action last autumn shows that although the British Empire will do its best to accomplish the doctrine of collective security, it still depends on the defense of the empire, allowing it to be a strong British navy. This lesson should be calmly and quietly pondered by both the country and the autonomous territories. Although there are such changes today, the fundamental fact that the empire's life depends on its maritime communications still exists. We should learn wisdom from the lessons of the past six months. We are determined to prevent the influx of war. The future naval power of our country will be stronger than in recent years, so our power to pursue peace will inevitably increase rather than decrease. Hoare concluded by saying that he found the article in the United States Naval Institute Proceedings calling for Anglo-American naval cooperation to make war impossible interesting and sympathetic.

<h3>Japan Refuses to Participate in the London Three-Power Naval Treaty; Naval Authorities Explain Their Views</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Because the Imperial Government decided not to participate in the British, American, and French naval treaty, the most important point of the treaty's qualitative restrictions, the stipulation that the caliber of main guns on battleships should be 15 inches, became a dead letter. The proviso in the latter part of the clause will take effect immediately and 16-inch guns seem to be under careful consideration. However, a glimpse can be seen in the foreign policy declaration issued by Imperial Navy Minister Osami Nagano in both the House of Representatives and the House of Peers a few days ago. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Ambassador Sato, who is attending the Montreux Conference, asking for instructions regarding the Turkish government's request. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sought the opinion of the Ministry of the Navy on the 24th. As a result of the meeting of leaders of the Ministry of the Navy, it was decided to take a firm attitude. The Japanese Navy expressed sympathy for the Turkish government and would do its best to revise the straits system. However, the Turkish government's request to impose excessively lenient restrictions on Soviet Russian warships sailing from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean Sea and to lack parity with the restrictions on foreign warships is something that should be corrected. However, Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations and cannot cooperate with the League of Nations to bear the obligation of ensuring the safety of the straits. This point must also be clearly stated. (Allied Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from Tokyo, the Japanese cabinet has decided to refuse to sign and join the naval treaty signed by Britain, France, and the United States. However, it is reported that Fujii, the Japanese chargé d'affaires in England, has not yet notified the Foreign Office of this decision. People in political circles do not find Japan's attitude unusual. What is attracting attention at this moment is only what intentions the country holds in the future. In other words, what will the country's future trend be? Will it comply with the treaty's restrictions in practice, even though it refuses to sign and join it in principle? Or will it ultimately take actions that violate the treaty? The general public now hopes that Japan will act with moderation and that its refusal to join the treaty is only for the purpose of formality, to preserve the country's prestige, and has no other intention. In particular, the British, French, and American naval treaty stipulates that the maximum caliber of main guns on battleships is 14 inches, and this restriction is conditional on Japan accepting it before January 1, 1937 (the date on which the three-power naval treaty comes into effect). Therefore, if Japan's attitude does not change by the end of this year, the impact will be that at least the caliber of main guns on battleships will increase from 14 inches to 16 inches.

<h3>The Explanation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement Has No Major Differences</h3>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons met today, a member asked to state the points of disagreement in the interpretation of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. First Lord of the Admiralty Hoare replied that he was happy to tell the members that all the details had been resolved satisfactorily and amicably and that there were no major differences in the interpretation.

<h3>The United States Changes Three Small Pacific Islands into Colonies; Preemptive Strike Against Britain to Open Air Stations</h3>
<p>Honolulu: The U.S. government has officially made Baker, Jarvis, and Howland Islands U.S. colonies and is moving U.S. citizens to live there. It is generally believed that the purpose of this move is to preempt Britain. There are now twelve U.S. students being transported to the islands by coastal patrol boat from Honolulu, with four people staying on each island and raising the U.S. flag on them. It is said that when a Honolulu-to-New Zealand air route was recently planned, the proposal to use the three islands as aircraft stops was noted by many. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

(Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The King of Abyssinia departed for Geneva today. Those who saw him off shouted, "Good luck!" and "God bless the King!" The King responded solemnly. Before his departure, the King expressed his deep gratitude to the British people for their sympathetic support. The Abyssinian embassy released a summary of the conversation between the King and British Foreign Secretary Eden on June 23, in which the King expressed his intention to vigorously oppose the lifting of sanctions against Italy in Geneva and to urge the League of Nations to take more forceful measures against Italy to uphold justice. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The King of Abyssinia departed from Victoria Station for Geneva at 2:00 PM today. The British government does not intend to send representatives to see him off. Official sources have stated that the British government does not send representatives to greet or see off foreign heads of state traveling in a private capacity. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>British and French Foreign Ministers Set Off for Geneva; Eden Makes a Brief Stop in Paris En Route</h3>
<p>(London) With the League of Nations meeting imminent, the discussion on abandoning the sanctions policy against Italy will be adopted and implemented. The discussion on the reorganization of the League of Nations will also be submitted for discussion by a majority of member states. The opening act of this drama, watched by all, will unfold here. The Cabinet is scheduled to meet this morning to give Foreign Secretary Eden final instructions, which will serve as his guide as he represents Britain in negotiations. After receiving his instructions, Eden is scheduled to take a plane to Paris this afternoon. Upon arriving in the French capital, he will meet with French Prime Minister Blum and Foreign Minister Delbos to exchange views. In addition, the Emperor of Abyssinia is also scheduled to depart for Geneva at the same time. It is reported that the Emperor will not personally engage in activities, but will maintain close contact with the Abyssinian delegation to the League of Nations. The Swiss Federal Government has notified the Emperor to refrain from residing in Switzerland until the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is resolved. Therefore, the Emperor intends to leave Switzerland after the conclusion of the League of Nations General Assembly and live in seclusion in the countryside, most likely near Brighton in England. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to take a train to Geneva at 9:20 PM tomorrow to attend the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council. Prime Minister Blum may travel to Geneva by road on Saturday of this week to attend the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations General Assembly. (June 30) (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Sovereignty of the Bahrain Islands Usurped by Britain; Iran Lodges Second Protest with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) The Bahrain Islands, located near the Arabian Peninsula in the Persian Gulf, are claimed by the Iranian government as its sovereign territory but have been seized by Britain. Iran has already lodged a protest with the League of Nations and has recently filed a second protest. British officials are not surprised and believe that this protest is unrelated to the recent visit of the Sheikh of Bahrain to London. Its motivation is due to the British government recently exchanging documents with the government of Hejaz in the name of the Bahrain government, stipulating that goods passing through the Bahrain Islands are subject to transit taxes levied by the authorities of the islands. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Germany Seeking Closer Ties in Military Technology; Italian Undersecretary for Aviation Makes Surprise Visit to Berlin</h3>
<p>(Rome) Lieutenant General Valle, Undersecretary of the Air Force and Chief of Staff of the Army, flew to Berlin yesterday. The local newspapers had kept the news secret beforehand and did not publish any reports before his departure. Only this morning was a Berlin dispatch released, stating that Lieutenant General Valle had arrived in the German capital. Political figures have offered some explanation for the purpose of Valle's visit, stating that the visit focuses on technical matters, while the political aspects are minimal. He is scheduled to visit various German aircraft factories and airfields today, accompanied by officials from the Nazi Party, and inspect the entire organization of the German Air Force. The closer ties between Italy and Germany in aviation technology are a prelude to a coordinated diplomatic policy. Since the start of the Italo-Abyssinian War, the governments of Germany and Italy have been working towards this direction, as can be seen from the similar tone of their newspapers. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Italian Fascist Party plans to send representatives to attend the Nazi Party congress in Nuremberg in September of this year, and the National Fascist Student Association is also advocating for sending 500 students to Berlin in August to attend the Olympic Games. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Upon arriving here, Italian Undersecretary of Aviation and Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Valle, immediately went to the Ministry of Aviation, where he was received by Secretary General Milch. Diplomatic sources believe that the reason General Goering avoided meeting him was because Hitler wanted to prevent a backlash from British public opinion, and therefore instructed officials to treat General Valle's visit with caution. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany's Huge Military Spending; 900 Million Pounds This Year - British Newspaper Publishes Figures</h3>

The maintenance costs for the army, navy, and air force in 1936, this year, totaled £500,000,000, with the basic cost of rearmament remaining the same as last year. Combining the two, military spending for this year totals £900,000,000. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Yoshizawa Ordered to Go to the US; Adjusting Japan-US Relations; Scheduled to Depart at the End of This Month</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Former Foreign Minister and Member of the House of Peers Yoshizawa Kenkichi is scheduled to depart from Yokohama for the United States on the Taiyo Maru on the 29th. While his ostensible mission is to represent Japan at the sixth general meeting of the Pacific Relations Conference to be held in North America this summer, in light of the complex and delicate state of Japan-US economic relations today, the overall adjustment of these relations has been carefully considered by the Foreign Minister since taking office. Ambassador Kurusu in Belgium was instructed to visit the US government and various key figures to negotiate and build understanding upon his arrival in the US. This time, former Foreign Minister Yoshizawa Kenkichi was persuaded to come forward to lay the foundation for adjusting Japan-US relations. Therefore, after attending the conference from August 15 to 29, he will visit Washington and New York to meet with President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and other business leaders to frankly exchange views on the current state of Japan-US economic affairs. The results are expected to be considerable. Regarding his decision to go to the United States, Yoshizawa told reporters at his home in Azabu, "I am just a wanderer. I cannot achieve much by going to the United States. Please do not have extravagant expectations." He is scheduled to depart from Yokohama on the 29th of next month. However, his actions after arriving in the United States have not yet been decided. However, since he is going to the United States, he naturally intends to visit Washington and New York. However, when and with whom he will meet, and what he will discuss, will all be decided after he arrives in the United States. Therefore, the date of his return is also difficult to predict.

<h3>US Navy Petty Officer; Case of Leaking Military Secrets; Charged with Violating the Espionage Act; Accused with a Japanese Person</h3>
<p>Los Angeles: Retired U.S. Navy officer Thompson and Japanese Navy Major Miyazaki have been charged with violating the Espionage Act and secretly reporting information about national defense to Japan, with a total of nineteen counts.

(Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>Los Angeles: A federal court judge today filed a public lawsuit for espionage against retired U.S. Navy Petty Officer Thompson and a Japanese person. This case attracted considerable national attention a few days ago because secrets of U.S. naval artillery were allegedly sold to foreigners. Federal law enforcement officers have detained Thompson here and prohibited him from communicating with the outside world. However, the whereabouts of the Japanese person are still unknown. It is rumored that the Japanese person has already fled back to Japan. The charges listed in the lawsuit are divided into espionage and conspiracy, totaling fifteen counts, including statements that documents, records, codes, signals, drafts, photographs, drawings, maps, "models, instruments, and information about national defense were all smuggled to Japan and sold to a Japanese official, etc., and that this action clearly harmed the interests of the United States." According to peacetime custom, he should be sentenced to four years in prison and a fine of 20,000 yuan. According to reports, the Japanese person is a colonel in the Japanese Navy who promised to pay Thompson a monthly salary, in addition to allowances, with a maximum amount of 300 yuan. These payments were transferred through the Yokohama Bank in San Francisco. (Kokumin, 24th)</p>

<h3>Belgian Prime Minister Announces Policy Platform; Major Reforms to Be Implemented in Society and Economy; Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Brussels: The Chamber of Representatives held its first meeting this afternoon, attended by Prime Minister Janson, who delivered a policy statement outlining the government's plans for large-scale reforms in society, the economy, politics, and the parliamentary system. Regarding society, the Cabinet's proposed plan includes the following three points: Establishing a minimum wage; Granting workers a certain number of days of paid annual leave; Implementing a 40-hour work week in factories where working conditions are harmful to health. In addition, the Cabinet also plans to expand the scope of compulsory education to reduce unemployment. "However, in order to implement this plan, various measures must be promoted in the economic and financial fields, such as reducing deposit and loan interest rates, converting foreign debt, and regulating banks." Regarding politics, the Cabinet intends to implement the various clauses contained in the Constitution - the freedom and rights granted to the people by the Constitution must be fully protected and must not be infringed upon. Regarding the electoral system, the Cabinet plans to reduce the number of representatives in the Chamber of Representatives "to strengthen executive power and stabilize the position of the Cabinet. The Cabinet will not immediately resign if a Cabinet proposal is rejected by the Chamber of Representatives, and will only resign in special circumstances, such as when the budget is rejected." Finally, regarding foreign policy, Prime Minister Janson only stated that the current Cabinet will follow the previous Cabinet's policies. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, Labor Minister Troclet presented three draft laws in accordance with the three points of the Cabinet's proposed social issues: Granting workers a certain number of days of paid annual leave; Increasing wages; Implementing a 40-hour work week in factories where working conditions are harmful to health.

<h3>British Cotton Cloth; India Reduces Tariffs; Major Blow to Japanese Dumping</h3>

<p>Coarse cotton cloth: 20% ad valorem or 3.5 annas per pound (25% ad valorem or 4.375 annas per pound); Coarse cloth with borders, printed cloth, twill, etc.: 20% ad valorem (25% ad valorem); Cotton yarn: same as before. (Domei, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Trade War with Australia; Implements the Trade Protection Law; Claims It Can Control Australia's Fate</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The government published an imperial ordinance in the official gazette on the 25th, launching the Trade Protection Law against Australia, which took effect immediately. (Domei, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of Japan's launch of the Trade Protection Law against Australia, trade relations between the two countries have virtually been severed, and an intense trade war is inevitable. As a result, Japan's export trade to Australia will naturally decrease. However, Japan imports 23 million yuan worth of wool and wheat from Australia each year. If Japan resists imports, it can control the fate of Australian farmers. (Domei, 25th)</p>
<p>Canberra: Australian Prime Minister Lyons made a radio address to the public today after hearing about the Japanese government's implementation of retaliatory plans for Australia's new tariffs, saying that Japan's move was deliberately intended to suppress Australia's trade policy. During recent contacts with Australian authorities, Japan stated that if Australia restricts the import volume of Japanese textiles and increases its import taxes, Japan would impose harmful restrictive clauses on Australian imports. However, the Australian government will not abandon its determination to protect Australian industry and maintain trade between Britain and Australia. Everything is now under consideration, but the Australian government does not want to hastily implement plans to resist Japan. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Democratic Convention; Robinson Attacked the Republican Party Vigorously; Committee Met Overnight to Consider Party Platform</h3>
<p>Philadelphia: Senator Robinson, chairman of the National Democratic Convention last night, spoke out against the Republican Party's platform and promised to focus on the plank advocating a return to the gold standard.

<p>Philadelphia, USA: The Democratic National Convention has quickly completed all temporary organizational procedures today and is preparing to discuss the platform and nominate a presidential candidate.</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA: The Democratic National Convention has quickly completed all temporary organizational procedures today and is preparing to discuss the platform and nominate a presidential candidate. In fact, the behind-the-scenes work has already been arranged. The delegates are meeting only to express the importance of the convention. Although the platform committee has received many suggestions throughout the day, all major issues have been predetermined. William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, demanded a reduction in the Supreme Court's power to invalidate congressional legislation, because in the past two years, the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled the National Recovery Act and other laws invalid, preventing the government from limiting minimum wages, maximum working hours, and appropriate working conditions. Green also represented labor in demanding that the Democratic Party support a 30-hour work week, continue public works, raise wages, protect labor organizations, and continue the New Deal's social security plan. O'Neal, president of the American Farm Bureau Federation, also presented eleven rural programs, such as controlling agricultural products, managing currency, reducing industrial product taxes, and restricting patents. The biggest point of contention was New York Governor Lehman's demands for wages and hours, because they were more stringent than those advocated by President Roosevelt. Regarding the monetary system, a platform has been drafted, supporting the principle of discretionary systems, and stating that the government will respond at any time according to changes in the financial situation. However, it did not mention restoring the gold standard, or immediately trying to establish international currency stability. Party leaders have expressed satisfaction with this platform, and it is understood that it does not intend to include Senator Thomas's proposal to increase the issuance of silver certificates to inflate the currency and raise prices. At the same time, the southern states opposed amending the convention's constitution to change the eligibility for presidential candidates from a two-thirds majority to a simple majority. This opposition was raised to the Rules Committee by Congressman Cox, but the committee did not take any action, so this point of contention will probably also be submitted to the convention for discussion. (Kokumin, 24th)</p>
<h3>Communist Party Presumed Candidate</h3>
<p>(New York) The Ninth National Convention of the Communist Party of America, which was recently held here, was chaired by party leader Foster, who delivered a speech. He first congratulated the French left-wing Popular Front on seizing power, calling it a "glorious victory," and argued that a strong Popular Front should also be organized within the United States, hoping that it would develop and grow to resist the reactionary behavior of the Fascist and militarist factions. Foster then attacked the "conservatives," saying that these people were trying to deprive the people of their inherent democratic rights and civil liberties. The fact that the "Black Robe Party" and the "Ku Klux Klan" can continue to exist and run rampant in the country is the fault of the "conservatives." These people now feel embarrassed by the people's protests and are using an irresponsible oligarchy as a talisman, which is the Supreme Court. According to reports, Foster has now been nominated by the Communist Party as a candidate for the general election, and this is the third time he has participated in the presidential race.

<h3>Following France's Lead: Dutch Bank Reduces Discount Rate</h3>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the Bank of France reduced its discount rate, and today, the Dutch Bank also lowered its discount rate from 4.5% to 4%. Well-informed circles in the foreign exchange market here are not surprised by this, considering it purely an act of imitation, as Dutch capital has virtually stopped flowing out. As for the Bank of France, it is widely believed that the reduction in the interest rate should not be seen as a sign of progress in France's financial situation; it is merely a gesture by the French government to reassure the people. Furthermore, since taking office, the French government has been waiting for an opportunity to implement a cheap money policy, which is an important part of the government's agenda, as evidenced by the upcoming issuance of "baby bonds."

<h3>Fuzhou Merchants Sanction Smuggled Goods: Silk and Cloth Guild Prepares to Prevent Sales, Banking Guild Restricts Loan Security</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Minhou County Chamber of Commerce and various trade guilds previously telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting a strict investigation of smuggled goods in order to protect the national economy. The Ministry of Finance replied that the government had already established various measures for smuggling and strictly ordered active prevention. From now on, all industrial and commercial enterprises only need to advise each other not to purchase and sell smuggled goods, and smuggling will naturally disappear. To eliminate smuggling relies entirely on the self-exertion of all industrial and commercial enterprises. For self-protection, it is also their own inescapable responsibility to prevent the encroachment of smuggled goods. The Chamber of Commerce has distributed circulars to various trade guilds to inform them. It has been found that the smuggled goods in this province are mainly textiles, foreign goods, and sugar. They mostly enter Fuzhou through the coastal areas of Fuqing, Putian, Changle, and Lianjiang. Dishonest industrial and commercial people, tempted by low costs and high profits, inevitably purchase smuggled goods. Recently, the silk and cloth industry has been auctioning goods, displaying prices, and distributing price lists in the market. The so-called Indian silk, flower silk, and yarn varieties are only ten cents per foot, suggesting that they are purchasing smuggled goods with low costs. Because the authorities are about to take action, the person in charge of the industry guild is concerned that there may be profit-seeking people among the colleagues, and if the facts are true, they will inevitably face criminal penalties. A special notice is issued to colleagues, advising them not to purchase goods without bills of lading and tax receipts. Measures for prevention, supervision, and reporting are being discussed. At the same time, the newly established Fuzhou Banking Guild has also resolved to unanimously refuse to mortgage smuggled or tax-evading goods. All merchants who want to pledge goods for loans must have customs tax receipts as proof before they will be accepted. As for the Provincial Tax Inspection Office, in the past week, it has uncovered a total of 26 smuggling cases in the coastal ports, including 387 and a half cases of foreign oil, 285 packages of white sugar, 27 boxes of tea, 37 packages of fertilizer powder, 15 bolts of rayon, and more than 400 jin of rayon, as well as other groceries, salted fish, fruits, matches, and drugs. They have been reported to the provincial authorities.</p>
<h3>Continuous Heavy Rainfall in Northeast: Flood Situation Serious; Railways Washed Away, Traffic Blocked; Communications Cut, Victims Awaiting Rescue</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Continuous heavy rainfall in various parts of Northeast China has led to an extraordinarily serious flood situation. Railways have been washed away, blocking traffic. Floods have overflowed, inundating farmland over a wide area. At a time when the Japanese puppet regime is imposing harsh policies, this situation is creating a sentiment of both divine and human resentment, which should not be underestimated. According to the information on the flood situation from the Harbin Puppet Railway Bureau, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Water Situation on the Labin Line</p>
<p>At noon on June 17th, the bridge pier of the Xilang River (between Shanhetun and Ping'an) on the Labin Line suddenly sank due to being submerged and impacted by the water. The second bridge was washed away, and the third pier was also tilted. Currently, train passage is impossible. In addition, the Hulan River, a tributary of the Xilang River on the Labin Line, has also overflowed. The bureau's residences and villages within Ping'an Station have been completely flooded, and residents are flocking to the station to take refuge. Also, because of the overflowing of the Lalin River and the Hulan River tributary, train services between Sijiafang, Liudaoling, and Shuiquanliu Ping'an, and Dujia and Shanhetun stations have been completely suspended since 9 AM on the 18th, causing the 101st passenger train, which departed from Harbin on the 16th (at 3:20 PM), to be forced to stop between Sijiafang and Liudaoling, unable to proceed. The Railway Bureau immediately dispatched a rescue train from Wuchang, stopping between Shuiquanliu and Ping'an to carry out emergency rescue. Regarding the flood situation in the aforementioned areas, the 103rd train, which departed from Harbin on the 17th, stopped at Shanhetun Station and could not proceed. The 101st train, still between Sijiafang and Liudaoling, returned to the Wuchang side. As of the 18th, trains departing from Harbin only reached Wuchang. Also, from 3 PM on the 18th, telephone communications south of Wuchang were completely cut off, and the entire situation is completely unclear. It is expected that the entire restoration work will take at least twenty days.</p>
<p>Disaster Situation on the Binsui Line</p>
<p>At 5 AM on June 18th, the roadbed near Lengshan, Shitouhezi, and the 1161 kilometer mark on the Binsui Line was washed away by water. Therefore, the 971st passenger train departing from Mudanjiang and the 901st passenger train departing from Suifenhe were stopped at Hengdaohezi, unable to proceed. Also, near the 1102 kilometer mark between Yimianpo and Wanshan, the river overflowed, and trains could not operate. Telephone communications east of Yimianpo have also been completely cut off. Rescue trains have been dispatched from the Yimianpo Railway Engineering Section to the dangerous locations affected by the flood for emergency rescue. However, due to the disruption of telephone communications, subsequent news is also completely unclear.</p>
<p>Planes Deliver Food</p>
<p>The Labin Line, now entirely submerged, and the areas near Ping'an and Liudaoling, the Harbin Railway, the Jilin Railway Bureau, and related Japanese authorities are currently negotiating to deal with reconstruction and rescue efforts. As for rescue trains, due to the complete disruption of telegraph and telephone communications, and the volume of water constantly increasing, its momentum is quite violent, and is forming a huge disaster. To this day, the Japanese puppet regime still has no appropriate solution. Currently, in order to buy people's hearts, they are promoting rescue operations for the disaster victims, first using aircraft to survey the disaster situation and then using aircraft to transport food to relieve the victims. However, the number of victims is extremely large, and the amount of food transported by aircraft is very small, a drop in the bucket, and is of no practical help.</p>
<h3>Datian Falls and is Quickly Recovered: Zhang Kewu's Bandits Occupy City for Three Days and Nights; Flee City Upon Hearing of Approaching Army</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The bandits Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu, originally from Dehua, recently fled back to their old nest in the western mountains of Dehua from Xianyou and Yongtai. On the 13th and 14th, the Zhang bandits gathered more than 1,000 scattered bandits from the four counties of Dehua, Xianyou, Yongtai, and Datian, raising the fake banner of the "First Route Army of the Chinese Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army," with Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu proclaiming themselves as division commanders. On the 18th, they launched an all-out attack on Datian in three routes. The two Zhangs each led one route, attacking the northeast of Datian. The former puppet battalion commander Tu Feifeng, led more than 200 men, attacking the south of Datian from Shanpingtou in the west of Dehua. On the 18th, they came into contact with more than 100 men from the squad led by squad commander Tan Maogong of the provincial security regiment, outside the south gate of Datian city. More than 100 men from the Datian County Security Team defended the northeast gate. After fierce fighting until night, most of the bandits continued to arrive and surrounded the county seat. The defending troops were vastly outnumbered. Squad commander Tan Maogong was killed in action, and the county seat was captured by the bandits at 11 PM on the 18th. The telephone line between Dehua and Datian was cut off by the bandits, and communications were lost. They also occupied the postal and telecommunications agencies in Datian. County magistrate Zhang Duanqiao led county government personnel and a portion of the county security squad, retreating through the north gate when the bandits captured the city. After the bandits entered the city, they immediately demanded 20,000 yuan from the Chamber of Commerce and all shops in the city. Because the county magistrate had fled, there was no leader in the city. Zhang Kewu then appointed a city gentleman to serve as county magistrate, but no one dared to accept. Regiment commander Peng Tang of the security regiment heard that bandits were spying on Datian and quickly led his troops from Dehua to reinforce. Upon arriving at the border between northern Dehua and Datian, he learned that the city had fallen. Later, because of the large number of bandits and Peng's troops numbering less than a thousand, he dared not advance rashly, and temporarily defended northern Dehua, preventing the bandits from returning. Datian mail also only reached Chishui Town in Dehua. At the same time, the Huang Su unit of the security regiment was ordered to reinforce Yongde. Huang then led a large detachment from Yongtai through Shuikou, Nanting, and Xishan, arriving in Dehua city on the 20th. Regiment commander Peng Tang returned to the city on the same day and discussed with Huang the method of suppressing the Zhang bandits. Soon after, they received an order from the Provincial Security Department, and the detachment of the regiment and the detachment of the regiment were all placed under the command of Huang Su. On the 21st, they launched a multi-pronged attack on Datian. Brigade commander Han Wenying led his troops, departing from Yongan for Datian on the 18th and arriving at Taoyuan on the 21st, only a hundred li from the county seat. Also traveling with them was a battalion of the 83rd Division's advance team. Upon hearing that the main army was about to arrive, Zhang Kewu abandoned the city at 11 PM on the 21st and fled back to Guiyang, on the border between Dehua and Yongchun. The Datian county seat was then retaken on the morning of the 22nd by the security regiment and the regiment. In total, the Zhang bandits occupied the city for three days and nights. After Huang Su and Peng Tang entered the city, they immediately handled the aftermath. The telephone line between Dehua and Datian was repaired on the 23rd. County magistrate Zhang Duanqiao's whereabouts were still unknown as of the 23rd, after he retreated from the county seat. The brigade departed from Taoyuan and arrived at Datian County on the 23rd. At the same time, the military strength of Yongchun, Dehua, Datian, and Xianyou was very strong, and the Zhang bandits were in danger of being surrounded. Councilor Zhu was sent by the Security Department, arriving in Dehua on the 20th, to recruit Zhang bandits. Zhu sent Ke Jiefu, the former chief of staff of Zhang Xiongnan, to Datian on the 21st, to contact Zhang Kewu and Zhang Chengfu. After the Zhang bandits retreated to Guiyang, Ke reported back that they were willing to be incorporated, but the specific methods have not yet been determined (June 25th).</p>

<h3>Decline of Agricultural Sidelines in Zhangzhou: From 5 Million Yuan Annually to 2 Million Yuan; Rural Cooperation is Being Planned for Relief</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Zhangzhou, located at the mouth of the Jiulong River, has fertile land and abundant water resources, making it the best agricultural production area in southern Fujian. In addition to rice, agricultural sidelines such as fruits and sugar cane are also abundant. In the past, items such as sugar cane, oranges, pomelos, lychees, longans, and daffodils had an annual production value of over 5 million yuan per county. Among these, besides sugar, oranges are the famous "Fuzhou oranges" of Shanghai, pomelos are "Pishan pomelos," and lychees and longans are considered unique products of southern Fujian. Daffodils are even more uniquely produced. However, in recent years, due to the dumping of foreign goods and smuggled goods, these special products have been greatly affected, dropping from over 5 million yuan to over 2 million yuan. According to a survey by the Longxi Office of the Rural Cooperation Committee, comparing the quantity and value of various agricultural sidelines in Longxi in 1926 and 1935, there was a difference of more than half: Sugar: In 1926, the production volume was 500,000 dan, worth 3.5 million yuan. In 1935, the production volume was 100,000 dan, worth 600,000 yuan, a decrease of over 80%. In the early years of the Republic, there were 36 sugar factories, but later, due to the dumping of foreign sugar, the production of local sugar sharply decreased, and the sugar factories closed down. Red oranges: In 1926, the production volume was 150,000 dan, worth 450,000 yuan. In 1935, the production volume was 400,000 dan, worth 1.2 million yuan, an increase of over 160%. Pomelos: In 1926, the production volume was 100,000 dan, worth 400,000 yuan. In 1935, the production volume was 50,000 dan, worth 200,000 yuan, a decrease of 50%. Lychees: In 1926, the production volume was 50,000 dan, worth 250,000 yuan. In 1935, the production volume was 30,000 dan, worth 150,000 yuan, a decrease of 40%. Longans (i.e., dried longans): In 1926, the production volume was 50,000 dan, worth 250,000 yuan. In 1935, the production volume was 10,000 dan, worth 50,000 yuan, a decrease of 80%. Daffodils: In 1926, the production volume was 100,000 cages, worth 400,000 yuan. In 1935, the production volume was 10,000 cages, worth 80,000 yuan, a decrease of 80%. According to the above statistics, the value of sideline products in 1926 was still 5.25 million yuan, while in 1935, it was only 2.28 million yuan. In order to gradually provide relief, the office has formulated a product sales cooperation plan: (A) The Farmers Bank of China will provide special product sales funds. (B) Improve production technology, supply production materials, reduce costs, and sell products to avoid selling at low prices and directly supply consumers. (C) Consolidate the credit and sales cooperatives that have already been established. Nine sales cooperatives and sixty-four credit cooperatives have been established, and new cooperatives will be developed. Sales cooperatives will be organized in areas where there are more than 100 producers or an annual production of more than 10,000 yuan (there are currently over 70 villages in special product areas that have not yet formed cooperatives). (D) Guide the organization of joint cooperatives. Special product loans are divided into: Sowing loans; Advance loans; Loans are repaid during the harvest and sale period of the products.

<h3>Beijing: Special Internal Debt, Fourteenth Lottery for Principal Repayment</h3>
<p>Beijing News: The Beijing Special Construction Public Bond held its fourteenth lottery for principal repayment on the 24th. Representatives from the Audit Department, Zhong Shurong; the Ministry of Finance, Dong Puming; the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Mu Huaxuan; the Foundation Management Committee, Shen Zuomei; and representatives from the Central, Zhongnan, and other banks in Beijing were present. The meeting began at 2:00 PM as scheduled. First, Secretary-General Wang, the chairman, gave a report, stating that the total amount of the public bond issued was 3 million yuan. Thirteen lotteries have been held, with a principal repayment of 1.95 million yuan and an interest payment of 1.032 million yuan. This lottery will repay 150,000 yuan in principal and 42,000 yuan in interest. Although the public bond fund was established at a time when the municipal treasury was extremely tight, each lottery for principal repayment and interest payment has been allocated in advance. The principal and interest to be paid in this lottery have been allocated to the Foundation Management Committee in accordance with regulations and deposited in various custodian banks. The vehicle tax that guarantees the principal repayment and interest payment of this public bond currently generates more than 180,000 yuan per quarter, or more than 360,000 yuan every six months. After allocating the funds to the fund, there is still a surplus, which is sufficient to show the stability of the credit of this public bond. Then, the supervisors checked the ledger of the winning numbers, and the lottery began. Five numbers were drawn: 94, 46, 74, 65, 31. Payment will begin on June 30.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: County Chamber of Commerce Prevents Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, based on reports from various industries that commerce has been greatly affected since smuggled goods were transported south for dumping, urgently needs to find ways to prevent this. Therefore, at 4:00 PM on the 25th, it convened representatives from relevant industries and invited Special Commissioner Sun from the County Party Department and County Magistrate Deng to attend and discuss together. More than ten people attended, including Xue Yongling, representing Chinese and foreign groceries; Mo Jingyong, representing iron and silk weaving; and Wu Xianglin, representing paper. Chairman Cheng Ganqing reported the reason for convening the meeting. After a long discussion, based on the methods of the Zhenjiang County Chamber of Commerce, a smuggling prevention committee was organized to strictly prevent smuggling. At the same time, the relevant trade associations of each industry will be responsible for handling the certification of cargo transportation for their respective industries.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Continuing Land Registration</h3>
<p>Since the local Land Administration Bureau began land registration on July 1 of last year, its work has been extremely intensive. As of the end of this month, it has completed the registration of the entire third district and the former Kaiyuan Township in the fourth district, totaling twenty-three townships. It has been decided to continue land registration for sixty-five townships in districts 4, 5, 6, and 7, starting on July 1, with a deadline of two months for completion. The registration will then be extended to the entire county. Yesterday, the county government instructed the district heads of each district to immediately convene meetings of township chiefs and bao chiefs to discuss registration procedures.</p>
<h3>Illegal Opium Den Sealed</h3>
<p>Chief Inspector Wang Ji of the Public Security Bureau received a secret report the other day, stating that the Xietai opium den in Shitang and the Xiesheng opium den in Nanfang were operating illegally, supplying opium paste to unlicensed opium addicts for private smoking, and there was also adulteration with private soil. After receiving the report, Chief Inspector Wang immediately dispatched Inspectors Ge and Feng to investigate in the countryside yesterday. They found five unlicensed opium addicts, including Gu Aben, in the opium dens and found that the registration and other matters were not handled in accordance with the prescribed procedures. The Xietai opium den was sealed due to the seriousness of the situation. Shao Junmou and others from the accounting department of the Xiesheng opium den were also taken to the bureau and transferred to the county government for review.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Road Worker Rapes and Kills Young Girl</h3>
<p>The case of robbery by road workers on Yangfu Road at the current port has not yet been resolved, and now a case of gang rape and murder of a young girl has occurred in Jincun. Caijin, the 20-year-old daughter of Jin Xiaodi, a farmer in Tongdangba, Jincun, had four or five road workers break into her home on the Dragon Boat Festival and demand rice dumplings. At that time, Jin was working in the field, and only Caijin was left at home to guard the house. The workers, seeing that the girl was defenseless, committed their bestial gang rape, which eventually led to her being on the verge of death. They then used needles to prick her arms. A neighboring girl noticed and ran to tell her father, who returned home and saw the situation. By evening, Caijin had died of exhaustion. Jin Xiaodi recognized the faces of the road workers and arrested Xue Asan, Jiang Dahong, Yang Asi, Zhang Abao, Wang A'er, and others, sending them to the county for investigation. According to the workers' confession, they admitted to the gang rape. On the Dragon Boat Festival, they went to the Jin family to buy rice dumplings and suddenly saw the girl (the deceased) lying unconscious on the bed. After Xue Asan examined her, he said she had heatstroke. Because he knew a little about acupuncture, he used a sewing needle to prick her to relieve the heatstroke. She was once awake. When her father returned home, he did not know the reason and accused them of raping and killing her. In fact, the girl died at midnight. The official ordered an autopsy for further verification and set the 25th to take a steamboat to the countryside for the autopsy. The workers were all taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Spring Cocoon Production Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>This year's spring silkworms in Wuyi have aroused great interest among farmers. However, due to the high price of leaves, the price of cocoons sold only covers the cost. Fortunately, the cocoons are in good condition, and the results are not bad. The cocoon businesses have now been completed. According to statistics from the Silkworm Improvement District, the county has raised a total of 160,400 spring silkworm cards, each of which can produce 35 catties of cocoons, equivalent to 13 catties of dry cocoons. The total cocoon production is over 19,300 dan, nearly double that of last year. The silkworm industry improvement fee that can be collected is over 87,000 yuan, and 60,000 yuan has already been collected. The autumn silkworm cards for this year have already been ordered and will be closed on July 10. It is estimated that the county needs cards. The Improvement District has ordered 60,000 cards from various seed production farms, with a selling price of 45 cents per card.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Strict Collection of Old Taxes</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government, under orders to pursue overdue old taxes, has established a Tax Collection Office to summon and detain households owing taxes. Those who are unable to pay are being detained, causing widespread complaints. Some, fearing the ferocity of the tax collectors and unable to pay, have even committed suicide. The authorities, however, insist on adhering to the law and dare not be negligent. Although various legal groups have appealed for a postponement of the collection, the pursuit is even more severe than before. Currently, over 400,000 yuan of old taxes have been collected in the county, leaving the people impoverished. Upon learning of this, the provincial government has sent Wei Songtang and others to Jiaxing to investigate the rural situation for review. It is learned that Wei and others have completed a clear investigation and returned to the province to report.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Measures for Establishing Agricultural Warehouses Determined</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Construction Department is preparing to establish agricultural warehouses in various counties. Experts led by Xu Yuanruo were dispatched to various counties in eastern and western Zhejiang to investigate warehouse locations. The work has now been completed, and a report on the cooperative warehouse establishment measures between the Construction and Civil Affairs Departments has been submitted to the province. On the evening of the 24th, the heads of the two departments met and determined the locations of five major warehouses: Yueqing, Pingyang, Jinhua, Linhai Haimen, and Haining Xiashi. The county-level warehouses will allocate one-third of the local grain reserves, converted to cash, for warehouse construction expenses. Each county will set up two to ten locations, using the grain reserve warehouses for agricultural warehouses. Small warehouses will temporarily use existing temples and other buildings as a principle. The large warehouse locations will conduct trial runs of small and medium warehouses simultaneously. The large warehouses require construction costs of 500,000 yuan and will be borrowed from the Shanghai Bank. The small warehouse expenses are planned to be borrowed from the Farmers Bank of China or the Agricultural and Industrial Bank. The plan will be launched in fiscal year 1936.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Hangzhou-Ningbo Section Launches Special Express Train</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate travel on the Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, it is planned to add a special express train. It is learned that the railway bureau has decided to implement this from July 15. The departure time has been changed to 7:45 AM from Ningbo, arriving in Cao at 10:10 AM, which connects with the Cao-Shao-Xiao Road bus. It can arrive in Hangzhou around 12:00 noon. However, the five small stations of Zhuangqiao, Hongtang, Yejia, Zhangting, and Shushan will not be stopped at in order to increase speed. The original early-morning local train running between Ningbo and Ci has been extended to Yuyao, departing from Ningbo at 6:55 AM.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Fierce Battle Between Police and Bandits in Yuxi</h3>
<p>In the Yuxi area of Tongyi, bandits have been rampant recently. The police team was dispatched to suppress them and encountered bandits in Minsheng Township. The bandits opened fire and resisted. One bandit was killed, and one policeman was also shot and killed. The bandits used the sorghum fields for cover and retreated westward. They are currently being pursued.</p>

<h3>Full Text of the Draft Agreement on Factory Inspection in the Public Concession Published</h3>
<p>Establish an Inspection Office to Enforce Chinese Factory Laws; Fessenden Says Implementation by July 1 is Not Possible</p>
<p>Municipal Council Applied to the Consular Body for Recognition Yesterday</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Mayor Wu believes that the factory inspection issue in the concessions has been delayed for too long, and disasters have occurred repeatedly, endangering the lives of workers. Factories with poor equipment especially affect workers' health. Therefore, he has consulted with the central government to find a solution as soon as possible within the scope of preserving China's sovereignty. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun has also negotiated with Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. Both sides have now formulated a draft solution, the content of which is that the Municipal Council recognizes that factory inspection in the concession is based on the authorization of the Chinese government and complies with Chinese laws. The Chinese authorities, on the other hand, recognize the special circumstances within the concession. Half of the inspectors will be recommended by the Municipal Council, but the established inspection office will fully comply with Chinese factory laws, factory inspection laws, and other relevant laws when performing its duties. Violators will be punished through court trials, and the qualifications of inspectors will also be strictly defined. The plan was approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors on the 24th, but it is heard that the Japanese side has expressed opposition, or it may still need to be discussed by the Consular Body. The municipal government will formally submit it to the central government for approval. The implementation procedures and steps are said to still require Secretary-General Yu and Fessenden to negotiate.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Agreement: Draft Agreement on the Implementation of the Factory Law in the Shanghai Public Concession (Revised June 15, 1936) 1. The Chinese authorities authorize the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to implement the Factory Law and its implementing regulations, as well as other relevant factory inspection laws, that have been implemented in the Chinese area and are agreed upon by both parties through negotiation from time to time, within the Public Concession. 2. A Factory Inspection Office will be established within the Municipal Council. Half of the inspectors will be appointed by the Chinese authorities and half by the Municipal Council. 3. Inspectors should possess the following qualifications: (A) Proficiency in Chinese and English; (B) Familiarity with the Chinese Factory Law and its implementing regulations; (C) Possession of knowledge or experience in any of the following fields: industrial chemistry, architectural hygiene engineering, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, statistics, or other experience applicable to factory inspection. 4. Each inspector should be on probation for six months before formal appointment. 5. Inspectors' salaries will be determined based on their qualifications and experience. 6. The above-mentioned Inspection Office should perform its duties in accordance with the Chinese Factory Inspection Law. 7. In cases of violations of the law, when the Chinese Factory Law needs to be enforced, a complaint should be filed with the court. 8. The Municipal Council should submit reports to the Chinese government in accordance with procedures to be agreed upon separately. 9. This agreement is valid for three years. Either party may notify the other party six months prior to the expiration date to terminate it.</p>
<p>Consular Body Meeting: A reporter from New Voice learned yesterday that the Municipal Council applied to the leader of the Consular Body, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, Sir Brenan, yesterday morning, attaching the full text of the agreement. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Lang, secretary of the Consular Body, told a reporter from New Voice that the Consular Body received the application for recognition from the Municipal Council this morning (i.e., yesterday morning) regarding the draft agreement on the implementation of the Factory Law in the Shanghai Public Concession. It is not yet decided when the Consular Body meeting will be held, nor is it certain whether it is necessary to hold a meeting for discussion. This matter may not necessarily go through meeting procedures, and it may be approved by each consul separately. If a meeting must be convened, it can be held within a week.</p>
<p>Implementation Pending: Fessenden, Director-General of the Municipal Council, also stated that although the draft agreement has been approved by the Municipal Council Board of Directors, it cannot be formally signed at this time because it still needs to be recognized by the Consular Body. Last time, I signed the document with Mr. Yu Hongjun, but it was not formal. When the formal signing procedure is held in the future, it will be carried out by formally appointed representatives of both parties. It is feared that it will take a considerable amount of time, and it will not be possible to start implementation by July 1.</p>
<p>Other Information: Article 3 of the draft agreement only stipulates that half of the inspectors will be appointed by the Chinese authorities and half by the Municipal Council. The exact number of half is not stated. However, according to foreign sources, the number of inspectors is specified as four Chinese and four foreigners, and there is a rumor that Ms. E. Hiuder, the current director of the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council, will be in charge of the matter. The agreement also does not disclose the source of funding, but it is said that it will be borne equally by both sides. It is also learned that once the agreement on the implementation of the Factory Law in the Public Concession is signed and implemented, Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the municipal government will continue to negotiate with the French Concession authorities to conclude an "Agreement on the Implementation of the Factory Law in the Shanghai French Concession." Because there is a precedent to follow, the solution will be easy.</p>

<h3>Loan Association Continues to Issue Small Loans</h3>
<p>Over 10,000 Yuan in Loans Approved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee held its thirty-first meeting at the China National Products Bank on Tianjin Road at 4:30 PM on the 24th. Committee members present included Cai Zengji, Zhang Peishen, Xi Demao (representing Zhang), Chen Guangfu (representing Cai), Song Ziliang, Qin Runqing, and Yu Zuoting (representing Qin). Chairman Cai Zengji reported on routine committee matters. Thirty-four applications for small credit loans were submitted. After review and decision, one loan was approved at the original requested amount, one was approved at half the original requested amount, and thirty-two were reduced. A total of 10,300 yuan in loans was approved. Additionally, five applications were rejected because either the business operations did not comply with the loan principles or the loan request did not comply with the regulations. All approved cases will be notified to the respective applicants by the committee. It was also reported that many recent loan applicants have not complied with Article 9 of the established principles, which states, "The loan amount shall not exceed half of the capital." The requested amount often exceeds or equals the declared capital. It is hoped that in the future, when companies and shops needing loans obtain application forms from the committee's office on the second floor of the National Products Bank on Tianjin Road, they should send a responsible person or the owner himself to facilitate detailed inquiries and avoid errors.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway and Others to Implement Intermodal Transport on Three Routes</h3>
<p>Intermodal Freight Transport Limited to Four Types of Goods Initially; Trial Period of Six Months Starting July 1st</p>
<p>The Huainan Railway, Jiangnan Railway, and Beijing-Shanghai/Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have reached an agreement to implement intermodal passenger and freight transport on these three routes. The scope of passenger intermodal transport is temporarily limited to third-class one-way and round-trip tickets and luggage parcels. Regardless of whether the tickets are one-way or round-trip, the fare for all three routes will be charged at 85% of the standard third-class fare. If a special express train is required, the additional express train surcharge should be paid according to regulations. As for the scope of intermodal freight transport, it is temporarily limited to whole-car shipments of wheat, rice, rapeseed, and soybeans. For the two main lines and the Jiangnan Railway, except for soybeans, which are charged at the current fifth-class freight rate and are subject to the intermodal decreasing rate for longer distances, the remaining three items are calculated according to the intermodal special rate and are not subject to the decreasing rate. On the Huainan Railway, all items are charged at the fifth-class freight rate and are subject to the decreasing rate. The two main lines and the Jiangnan Railway will initially only handle arrival shipments, not originating shipments. Yaohuamen and Wuhu Riverbank Station will serve as connecting stations for intermodal transport. The two main lines have temporarily designated six stations: Zhenjiang West Station, Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, Shanghai North Station, and Hangzhou. The Jiangnan Railway is only a transit route and does not have intermodal transport stations. The Huainan Railway has temporarily designated ten stations: Tianjia'an, Datong, Huainan Mine, Hefei, Zhonggan, Chaoxian, Cuozhen, Xiatangji, Jiong Yanghe, Qiaotouji, and Yuxikou. The intermodal transport period will begin on July 1st of this year and will be a trial run for six months. After the trial period, further negotiations will be held to continue the operation.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Plans to Open Sichuan River Route</h3>
<p>New Giant Aircraft Joins the Yangtze River Route</p>
<p>To develop transportation, the China National Aviation Corporation is planning to open a Sichuan river route, departing from Chongqing and passing through Luxian, Xufu, and Jiading, directly reaching Chengdu. It is learned that the company has already sent personnel to survey the route. In addition to establishing an office in Luxian, aviation branch stations will also be set up in Xufu and Jiading. They are currently surveying airport locations and will begin construction as soon as suitable locations are found and start flight service. The DC-2 giant Douglas aircraft ordered by the company from the United States arrived in Shanghai on the 24th and was immediately transported to Longhua Airport for assembly. It is expected to be completed next week and will join the Yangtze River route flights.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper: Kawagoe's China Policy</h3>
<p>Different Shades from Previous Ambassadors</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Review translated from the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun says that the arrival of Kawagoe, the new Japanese ambassador to China, is of great significance in how to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations. Since landing on the 22nd, the ambassador has briefly outlined his China policy. These are, of course, fragmentary glimpses, but it is not difficult to see the foundation of the ambassador's plans. What we should pay particular attention to is that the ambassador's aspirations for China seem to place more emphasis on economics than politics. This is slightly different from the style of previous ambassadors to China. The adjustment and development of Sino-Japanese relations based on this approach are also something that both countries cannot help but hope for. But what exactly is the nature of Ambassador Kawagoe's economic aspirations for China?</p>
<p>According to the specific content of Ambassador Kawagoe's economic aspirations for China, as expressed on various occasions before and after his arrival in China, it seems to lie mainly in railway construction and the survey and development of mining. Railway construction is a very urgent issue in China, and it goes without saying. China, a country with vast land and abundant resources, has had its materials buried in the ground and the development of various industries delayed due to the lack of railway construction. In addition to the economy, political unification is also waiting for a long time to achieve. Railway construction is the most urgent of urgent tasks. China itself knows this best. Japan's cooperation in this matter, under certain conditions, can undoubtedly be said to be beneficial to China. Cooperation, since Japan does not have funds to lend, refers to the provision of materials and technology. If China uses the materials provided by Japan to carry out railway construction, it would be a great plan for the long term with great benefits. The so-called minor details of conditions and other aspects are merely issues that have not yet been addressed. We believe that in the near future, if Ambassador Kawagoe proposes this issue, it would be wise to accept it without doubt. Secondly, the survey and development of mining is also a very important issue for China, just like railways. The iron ore in Henan and Fujian, the petroleum in Shaanxi, the antimony in Hunan, the manganese in Hunan and Guangxi, and the coal in North China all have unlimited reserves underground. This can also provide sufficient and large-scale exports. Cooperation with Japan in this area is also mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>Ambassador Kawagoe's economic aspirations are as described above, which is quite beneficial to both parties. If the Chinese side has sincerity in promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation, then even if there are some differences on specific details, the overall outline should certainly be acknowledged.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Opium in Concessions Urgently Needs to Proceed; Ma Liang Visits Mayor Yesterday</h3>
<p>Our Side Hopes for Cooperation from Concession Authorities in Investigation and Suppression; Over 10,000 Opium Addicts in Shanghai Have Quit</p>
<p>The suppression of opium in the concessions, after the Opium Suppression General Supervisory Department of the Military Commission separately instructed the Shanghai Commissioner's Office and the Municipal Government to discuss the matter, Opium Suppression Inspector Ma Liang visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Central District yesterday morning to discuss implementation methods. The municipal opium suppression agencies are working hard on opium suppression in order to eradicate it within the set timeframe. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspector Visits Mayor Wu: Ma Liang, Opium Suppression Inspector and Director of the Shanghai Office of the Opium Suppression General Supervisory Department of the Military Commission, after receiving the order from the Supervisory Department, went to Beijing the day before yesterday to meet with the authorities and request instructions on how to implement opium and drug suppression work in the concession areas. He returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Inspector Ma visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Central District at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to discuss with the Public Concession's Municipal Council and the French Concession's Board of Directors the various implementation methods and steps for opium and drug suppression.</p>
<p>External Correspondence: According to inquiries made by the Dagongbao reporter to the municipal opium suppression agencies, our side hopes that the concession authorities will not abandon their preconceived notions of sovereignty. While they claim to be assisting on the surface, they have not made any concrete expressions of cooperation, making it difficult to achieve practical results in implementation. The Opium Suppression General Supervisory Department of the Military Commission is eliminating these difficulties by requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send a note to the ministers and consulates of the countries related to the two concessions, requesting their sincere assistance in cooperating with our side in carrying out opium and drug suppression work. They plan to jointly establish a similar opium and drug suppression agency within the possible scope of not hindering sovereignty.</p>
<p>Opium Addicts Who Have Quit: The Municipal Public Security Bureau released information on opium suppression work, including: 1. The number of opium addicts who renewed their permits in the second phase, from April 1st to June 23rd, was 18,141. 2. The number of opium addicts who reapplied for their opium quitting certificates from May 10th to June 20th was 5,295. 3. The number of opium addicts who have quit, from July to December 1935, was 5,397; from January to May 1936, was 5,060, totaling 10,457 opium addicts who have quit. There are also 700 to 800 people still in various opium quitting hospitals.</p>
<p>District Inspections: Because the deadline for renewing opium permits in the second phase has been extended to the end of this month, with only five days left until the deadline, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has dispatched all personnel from the inspection division to various districts to work with the local branch bureaus and district offices to step up inspections. Those who have not renewed their permits by the second deadline will be sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for strict investigation. Government employees who smoke opium have also been instructed by the police bureau to quit quickly, otherwise they will be investigated and prosecuted according to the law.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Reports: Dr. Jourdan Discusses Drug Suppression in Concessions</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that yesterday, a reporter from the North-China Daily News spoke with Dr. Jourdan, Director of the Public Health Department of the Public Concession, about the different regulations in Britain and Shanghai regarding the sale of prohibited drugs and showed him advertisements published in pharmaceutical magazines. It stated that, according to the 1933 Medicines and Poisons Act, certain medicines are not allowed to be sold except with a doctor's prescription. The list includes products advertised for sale in Shanghai newspapers, which the authorities have not taken action to suppress. Dr. Jourdan replied that Shanghai has a special status, so it is currently inconvenient to implement the new regulations governing the sale of poisons. To implement these new regulations, one must have a team of qualified inspectors to regularly check whether pharmacies are complying. However, the current economic situation of the Municipal Council does not allow for the establishment of such inspectors. One must also force all doctors to register. Although this measure was submitted to taxpayers as a regulation as early as 1906, it was not approved. The authorities are now carefully considering the whole problem. However, Shanghai has several unique difficulties that cannot be easily eliminated unless they are rejected by public opinion. Moreover, Shanghai is an international city with its own unique problems.</p>
<h3>Electric Power Company: Hosts Newspaper Reporters Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company invited reporters from Chinese newspapers in the city to lunch at the company's factory on the fourth floor of the No. 4 Dongting Road on Yangshupu yesterday at 12:15 PM. Representatives from various newspapers attended. After lunch, Mr. Ferris and the company's engineers led a tour of the factory. The factory's engineering is vast and the equipment is complete. However, unfortunately, the heat inside was too high to stay and inquire in detail. After the tour, everyone rested on the fourth floor for a while, and the host shook hands goodbye and departed at 3:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Qingdao Branch of the Federation of Labor Unions Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Investigate Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>And to Discuss Prevention Measures, Will Depart in Three Routes</p>
<p>The Qingdao Branch of the Shanghai Chinese General Federation of Industry is sending personnel to Shanghai to investigate and penalize smuggling. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate: Due to rampant smuggling in North China and the authorities' lack of preventive measures, the Qingdao Branch of the Chinese General Federation of Industry has sent Chairman Yin Zhizhong, Executive Zheng Wenzheng, and Executive Committee Member Huang Wenshen to Shanghai yesterday to investigate the situation. They will divide into three routes to investigate: 1. Yin Zhizhong will go to the Yangtze River area, then to Sichuan, and then to Xi'an before returning to Qingdao. 2. Zheng Wenzheng will go to Beijing, then to Zhengzhou, and the Jinghan Road and Jinpu Road areas. 3. Huang Wenshen will go to the Jinghan and Longhai Road areas. In addition to investigating and preventing smuggling, they will also investigate commercial conditions in various locations.</p>
<p>Yin Zhizhong Speaks: According to the New Voice News Agency, a reporter met with Chairman Yin Zhizhong yesterday. According to him, smuggled goods in Qingdao are purely by land, transferred from Tianjin. Artificial silk and sugar are the most common. Due to special circumstances, people can only encourage it psychologically and cannot penalize it in reality. The Chamber of Commerce has also not been able to make any concrete expressions. Merchants are not affected, and the production industry suffers the most. Smuggled goods shipped to Qingdao are currently stockpiled and have not yet been sold. It is estimated that they account for more than twice the amount of imported goods. Qingdao is located in the commercial center of North China, with convenient land and water transportation and a special environment. Because political power used to belong to foreigners, people have a deep-rooted impression of buying and using foreign goods. Since the handover, although domestic products have gradually developed, there is a lack of specialized advocacy agencies, making it difficult to reverse people's psychology of loving foreign goods, resulting in sales difficulties and no way to buy domestic goods. If we want to reverse this decline, we must integrate the industry. Therefore, this association invites national factories to join, so that the group can be sound and develop slowly. In recent years, various industries have been declining. This summer festival, Qingdao is just maintaining the status quo. However, the stockpiling of smuggled goods and dumping in the second half of the year is very worrying. We will depart in separate routes soon and expect to return to Qingdao by the middle of next month.</p>
<h3>Customs Orders Prevention of Smuggling; Notifies Businesses to Obtain Licenses and Register</h3>
<p>Businesses Selling, Transporting, and Using Investigated Goods Must Obtain Licenses and Register with the Jianghai Customs</p>
<p>In order to prevent the import of smuggled goods, the Ministry of Finance has ordered all customs offices to handle it. All businesses, factories, and transportation companies that sell, purchase, transport, and use imported goods that should be investigated must register and obtain a license. Tang Hai'an, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs in this city, and Ma Runsen, the Tax Commissioner, issued a joint announcement No. 1521 yesterday morning, stating, "We have received an order from the Ministry of Finance to issue temporary regulations for investigating the transportation and sale of imported goods, methods for registering and obtaining licenses for businesses, factories, and transportation companies that sell, purchase, transport, and use imported goods that should be investigated, and a list of foreign goods that require a transportation and sales license. Please comply accordingly." Therefore, we enclose the aforementioned regulations, methods, and lists for your information. We hereby announce this to all merchants. (See the advertisement column for details).</p>
<h3>Yesterday, various sectors again sent telegrams urging the Central Government to stop the advance of troops from Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>Also telegraphed Chen, Li, Bai, etc., urging them to quickly withdraw their troops</p>
<p>Various sectors in Shanghai, concerned that the advance of Guangdong and Guangxi troops would affect the current situation, have sent telegrams to the Central Government, urging a swift halt to the advance, with some even requesting an explicit order for suppression. Simultaneously, telegrams were sent to Chen, Li, Bai, and others, urging them to quickly withdraw their troops to their original defenses to salvage the critical situation. The telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>University Presidents</p>
<p>Telegram to President Jiang: To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Your Excellency. I have received and fully understood your telegram. Matters of foreign policy are vital to our survival; therefore, we should await the decision of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Otherwise, using the pretext of resisting the enemy to incite internal strife will inevitably undermine the entire national anti-foreign front. The responsibility for harming the nation should be clearly assigned. I humbly request you to devise a sound method to quell internal conflict and swiftly implement it, to consolidate the foundation of the nation and resist foreign aggression. This telegram is urgent, and I implore you to consider it carefully. Respectfully, University Presidents of Shanghai: Weng Zhilong, Yan Fuqing, Zhang Shouyong, Liu Haisu, Xiao Fangmei, Li Denghui, Liu Zhanen, Pei Fuheng, He Bingsong, et al. (With seal)</p>
<p>Telegram to Chen, Li, Bai: To Commander Chen Bo of Guangzhou, Commanders Li and Bai of Nanning, Greetings. I have respectfully received and understood your telegram. Defending against aggression and saving the nation is a common desire. However, matters of foreign policy are vital to our survival. All steps must adhere to the principle of not undermining the entire national anti-foreign front. Otherwise, we will only gladden our enemies and sadden our allies. As commanders leading national troops and stationed on the southern border, your every move affects the overall situation. Your opinions on the great plan to save the nation should be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for public discussion and resolution. At this time of widespread public anxiety, I urge you to quickly withdraw your troops to their original defenses, to demonstrate sincerity and salvage the critical situation. I humbly request you to carefully consider this. Respectfully, University Presidents of Shanghai: Weng Zhilong, Yan Fuqing, Zhang Shouyong, Liu Haisu, Xiao Youmei, Li Denghui, Liu Zhanen, Pei Fuheng, He Bingsong, et al. (With seal) (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Municipal General Labor Union Telegram: The Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union yesterday sent a telegram to the Central Government, stating: To President Jiang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Vice President Kong, Greetings. The previous deployment of Guangdong and Guangxi troops northward, acting rashly and claiming military authority, was addressed by Your Excellencies with plans for consolidating the solidarity of comrades, streamlining steps, and making comprehensive plans for a united front against external enemies. This was done to wipe away years of humiliation and avenge our ancestors. Therefore, clear orders were repeatedly issued for the stationed troops to retreat, demonstrating the Central Government's magnanimity and urging the leaders of the Southwest to awaken as soon as possible. However, news has arrived that reports claiming the Guangdong and Guangxi troops have complied with the order to retreat are completely false. At that time, the troops temporarily moved to the Jiangxi border to requisition food, while simultaneously dispatching large forces as reinforcements. Now, they have taken a further step, directly entering Hunan and Jiangxi, and extending into Fujian. Furthermore, it is reported that the Guangxi troops between Qiyang and Hengzhou have begun attacking the local stationed troops. The situation has taken a sharp turn, which is shocking. Such deliberate plotting and harboring of sinister intentions is not only condemned by our entire nation but also makes them criminals for generations to come. Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese imperialists have been advancing inch by inch, with insatiable greed. The leaders of the Southwest dare to take advantage of this danger, acting as accomplices, using false pretenses to undermine unity. If Your Excellency does not issue an explicit order for suppression, there is no way to prevent the outbreak of chaos and solidify the foundation of the nation. I implore Your Excellency to prioritize the nation and the people, swiftly dispatch an expeditionary force to eliminate these rebels and establish a national foundation. Only then can we unite against external enemies and avoid internal worries. The survival of the nation and the rise and fall of the people depend on this single action. I beseech Your Excellency to consider this. This telegram is written with tears and the utmost urgency, awaiting your command. Respectfully, Shanghai Municipal General Labor Union. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Municipal Farmers' Association Telegram: The Municipal Farmers' Association yesterday sent a telegram to the Central Government, stating: To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, National Government, Executive Yuan, and Military Affairs Commission, Greetings. Since Guangdong and Guangxi, under the pretext of resisting Japan, moved their troops north, invading Hunan and Jiangxi, and undermining unity, this association, witnessing the difficulties of the times, has repeatedly telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, stating the advantages and disadvantages in detail, urging them to reflect, and requesting the Central Government to effectively stop them to prevent the outbreak of chaos. However, news has arrived that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have intensified their actions. Recently, they invaded the heart of Hunan Province and arbitrarily established a military committee, disregarding the appeals of the people and the fate of the nation. Their rebellious actions are evident. Our Central Government should no longer tolerate this, lest it lead to greater disasters. To resist foreign aggression, we must first eliminate the internal traitors who act as accomplices for the enemy. To save the nation, we must quickly eliminate the rebels who use false pretenses. We implore the Central Government to issue an explicit order for suppression, to rectify discipline and maintain the nation. This telegram is submitted with a special request. I humbly request you to resolutely denounce and effectively stop them. The Party and the nation will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate. This telegram is sent respectfully. Shanghai Municipal Farmers' Association. (Dagong News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegrams from Various Trade Guilds: One hundred and sixty-three trade guilds in this city, including the silk, satin, paper, lumber, and cotton cloth industries, yesterday telegraphed the Central Government, urging them to rectify the six armies and explicitly order a halt to the unusual movements in Guangdong and Guangxi. The telegram stated: To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government, President Jiang and Vice President Kong of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang and Vice Chairmen Feng and Yan of the Military Affairs Commission, Greetings. When Guangdong and Guangxi first mobilized their troops and engaged in unusual movements, our Central Government repeatedly and earnestly explained the situation, and local people sent numerous telegrams urging peace. All hoped that the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi would pull back from the brink. Then, it was reported that the troops invading Hunan had retreated to the border of Hunan, and we hoped that Guangdong and Guangxi's remorse would save the nation from its precarious state. However, the situation has taken a sharp turn in recent days. Not only have they arbitrarily established a military committee and implicitly raised the banner of independence, but the Guangxi troops on the Hunan border have also continued to advance without end. This kind of action, advancing under the guise of retreating and intensifying their actions, is enough to undermine unity and harm the Republic of China. If our Central Government troops continue to retreat step by step, allowing the rebel troops to collude with foreign enemies and connect with internal bandits, tolerating evil and fostering trouble, repentance will be too late. Their rebellious plans have been brewing for a long time, and their treasonous actions are now evident. Letters and telegrams of admonishment can no longer suppress their ambitions. I hope that the Central Government will uphold its consistent aspiration to suppress chaos and save the nation, rectify the six armies, and explicitly order sanctions. Then, villains will have nowhere to hide, and great disasters can be eliminated. The nation and the people will deeply benefit from this. This urgent statement is presented with utmost trepidation, awaiting your command. Respectfully, Shanghai Silk, Satin, Paper, Lumber, Cotton Cloth and 163 Trade Guilds. (New Sound News Agency)</p>
<p>Telegrams from Joint Meetings of Various Public Organizations: The New Method Laundering, New Medicine, and Citizens' District Branches of this city, after a joint meeting the day before yesterday, yesterday jointly telegraphed Guangdong and Guangxi, requesting the withdrawal of forward troops. The original text stated: To Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, Commander-in-Chief Li Delin of Nanning, and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Jiansheng, Greetings. Since the loss of the Northeast, ambition has grown daily. Judging from the current trend, the entire territory of China will be trampled by the enemy. At this critical moment, you are using the pretext of resisting Japan to act independently, advancing troops into Hunan and causing a civil war. When the news spread, the public was terrified. Various public organizations in this city held a joint meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on a certain day. After discussion, it was agreed that resisting Japan and saving the nation is a common desire. However, acting independently outside of the overall national plan will not harm the enemy but will only cause national division, bringing ridicule from foreign countries. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot but feel pained. I hope you will pull back from the brink to preserve a glimmer of hope for the nation and discuss a unified plan for resistance at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee using reasonable methods. The future of the nation and the people depends on this. This is telegraphed with respect, requesting your consideration. Respectfully, Joint Meeting of Various Public Organizations in Shanghai.

<p>A Special Municipal Citizens' Association</p>
<p>Telegram Urging Central Government to Be Patient: The First Special District Citizens' Association yesterday telegraphed the Central Government, stating: To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government Military Affairs Commission, Greetings. Since the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, under the pretext of resisting the enemy, deployed troops in Hunan and Fujian, the public has been terrified and at a loss for words. For the past ten days, our Central Government has consistently shown magnanimity, hoping to persuade them to repent with sincerity and trustworthiness. All of our countrymen deeply understand the Central Government's painstaking efforts. However, news has arrived that Guangdong and Guangxi are increasing troops in Hunan and Fujian, with urgent military movements and obvious intentions. This association is extremely worried. In addition to sending urgent telegrams to the military leaders of Guangdong and Guangxi, urging them to prioritize the overall situation and quickly withdraw the advancing troops, we also earnestly request our Central Government to exercise final patience. All plans to save the nation should be decided at the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. If the Guangdong and Guangxi troops at the front are unrepentant and recklessly provoke conflict, then for the sake of Chinese law, discipline, and the nation, the people should unanimously support sanctions. Only by first securing internal stability can we talk about repelling foreign aggression. The logic is extremely clear. Respectfully, First Special District Citizens' Association of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Telegram Urging Guangdong and Guangxi to Withdraw Troops: The First Special District Citizens' Association, yesterday telegraphed the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, saying: (Omitted above). National crisis is imminent. Mutual non-interference and shameful compromise are not enough to seek survival. Lightly talking about resisting the enemy will not help the matter. Therefore, since you raised the banner of resisting the enemy and deployed troops in Hunan and Fujian, we were initially pleasantly surprised, but later we could not help but feel worried. The movement to resist Japan is the key to the survival of the nation. It requires an overall plan and universal mobilization. If acting alone, it will only be strategically disadvantageous. It is enough to harm the dignity of an independent country and deplete the real strength of the nation. This should be seriously considered even when truly resisting the enemy. Moreover, it is reported that the Guangxi army is digging trenches and building fortifications in southern Hunan, preparing for war with great haste. The vanguard troops approaching Hengzhou City have even launched shooting attacks on the positions of the garrison troops in that city. Is the so-called resistance to the enemy just following the old tricks of warlords, attacking the cities and seizing the land of their own country? Moreover, since the dispatch of troops, military expenses have been enormous. The requisitioning of supplies in the rear is insufficient, so it is followed by foreign debts. According to Hong Kong telegrams, the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities are currently signing loan contracts with Japan in the name of the Da Guang Company and obtaining a large supply of military aircraft. This is even more shocking and inexplicable. Does the so-called resistance to the enemy mean attacking the enemy with the enemy's spear? Since you have mobilized together in Guangdong and Guangxi, disgruntled military personnel, politicians, and traitors have all gathered in Guangdong, scheming in every possible way to seek personal gain. You also accept and tolerate them, giving them extremely generous treatment. How can such a corrupt and complex combination talk about resisting the enemy? How can you expect any effective results in resisting the enemy? All of this is reported in the newspapers, which may not be entirely credible. However, rumors are not entirely without cause. I believe you are pained by the warlord separatism and political betrayal, which are enough to hinder the survival of the nation. You led brave soldiers to carry out punitive expeditions and endured hardships, earning a precious unified situation. However, your actions today, arbitrarily moving troops, can affect the overall situation with the slightest movement. The old tricks of past warlords seem to suggest that you are willing to repeat them. This association cannot bear to see your reputation ruined in a single day and the nation's lifeblood sacrificed needlessly. Therefore, we have resolved to telegram you, urging you to prioritize the nation and quickly withdraw the advancing troops to their original defenses. All plans for saving the nation should be submitted to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee for sincere discussion, to comply with public opinion and comfort the people's hopes. We cannot express our hopes enough. Respectfully, First Special District Citizens' Association of Shanghai. (New Sound News Agency)</p>
<p>Second Special District Citizens' Association Telegram: The Second Special District Citizens' Association, yesterday telegraphed the National Government Military Affairs Commission, stating: "To Chairman Lin of the Nanjing National Government and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, Greetings. This association previously noted that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities, at a time when the nation is facing difficulties and the national crisis is deepening, are using the pretext of resisting Japan to arbitrarily send troops to invade neighboring provinces and attempt rebellion. We telegraphed Your Excellency, requesting you to explicitly order them to stop, and telegraphed Chen, Li, etc., urging them to pull back from the brink and not become criminals of the nation and the people. A week ago, the atmosphere in the Southwest eased slightly, and we hoped that we could turn hostility into friendship and unite our hearts to resist the enemy. Unexpectedly, recent news from various sources indicates that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities not only do not know how to wake up, but also intensify their actions, changing the system and establishing new institutions. There are also reports that they have sent troops to attack the garrison troops in Hunan and Jiangxi. If this is true, it is clear that they want to undermine unity and harm the country. Such actions are already evidence of rebellion. We request Your Excellency to issue an explicit order for suppression, to rectify the national discipline and prevent the outbreak of chaos. This telegram is written with utmost urgency and hope. Respectfully, District Branches of the Second Special District Citizens' Association of Shanghai." (National News Agency)</p>
<p>Various Seamen's Organizations</p>
<p>Chinese Seamen's Union: Special Commissioner's Office Telegram: To the Nanjing Central Executive Committee, National Government Executive Yuan, and Military Affairs Commission, Greetings. I have the honor to request your attention to this document. Yesterday, it was reported that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops, pretending to retreat, were actually changing their route to invade the north, ignoring the Central Government's warnings and disregarding the people's appeals. Their madness knows no bounds. This association has again sent a telegram of advice, hoping to avert the disaster, which states (see elsewhere). If they go too far and show no repentance, our Central Government cannot continue to condone their rebellious behavior to maintain national prestige. I hope you will seize the opportunity to stop them, to avoid undermining the foundation of the nation and causing external troubles. This is stated frankly. I implore you to understand clearly. Respectfully, Special Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Seamen's Union. To Commander Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, Commanders Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng of Nanning, Greetings. The current national crisis requires the concentration of national strength and a united effort to save the nation. This is an undeniable consensus of the entire country. Since the sudden turmoil on the Hunan border, all Chinese have shed tears and called for a return to defense. However, it was reported yesterday that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops on the borders of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian were pretending to retreat but were actually changing their route to invade the north. If they go too far, it will only increase the benefits for others and cause an unprecedented disaster in history. You, acting as the leaders of the rebellion, will inevitably be condemned by the people and become criminals for thousands of years. I hope you will pull back from the brink and return to your own territory. If you have any brilliant ideas, you can contribute them to the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to determine an overall plan for saving the nation. There will be a time to serve the country and a place to show loyalty. Please do not point your guns inward, which will lead to destruction. Respectfully, Special Commissioner's Office of the Chinese Seamen's Union. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Navigation United Righteousness Association and Others Telegrams: To Commander Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, Commanders Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng of Nanning, Greetings. Recently, we read reports that troops retreated from Chenzhou and Yongzhou but then invaded Fujian and Jiangxi. News is frequently spreading, causing both joy and fear. At a time when foreign aggression is imminent and the national crisis is critical, all those with blood in their veins cannot but feel anger. However, resisting foreign aggression requires unity and solidarity to save the nation. Preparation must be thorough, and steps must not be chaotic. Without this, resisting foreign aggression will only invite more aggression, and saving the nation will only hasten its demise. Now, you are sending troops from remote areas, using the name of resisting Japan to carry out acts of betrayal, hiring Japanese advisors, purchasing enemy aircraft to kill our compatriots, destroying the nation's defenses against foreign aggression, and giving the enemy an opportunity to invade. Resisting Japan while colluding with Japan is harming the people while pretending to save them. Such behavior is something that even the warlords who harmed the country in the past could not bear to do. And you, with a glorious history, are actually embarking on this unjust path. I secretly disapprove of your actions. I hope you will pull back from the brink, awaken, and not make a reckless gamble due to a moment's mistake. Do not start a disaster of division, fall into the enemy's trap of using Chinese to control Chinese, or trap the nation in an irrecoverable situation. Do not leave behind the condemnation of future generations. Honor, disgrace, obedience, and defiance are all clearly evident. You are wise and should consider this early. This telegram is sent with a racing mind and tears. Respectfully, Chinese Seamen's Navigation United Righteousness Association, Navigation Helmsman Carpenter Mutual Aid Association.

<p>China Yangtze River Leading Navigation General Association: To the Nanjing Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the National Government Military Affairs Commission, and the various ministries and commissions, Greetings. The Guangdong and Guangxi generals, under the false pretense of resisting Japan, are creating turmoil and undermining national unity and destroying the nation's vitality. This is extremely evil. As the national crisis deepens daily, there is no way to repel foreign aggression without securing internal stability. I dare to request an explicit order for suppression, to prevent the outbreak of chaos and maintain the foundation of the nation. This urgent telegram is sent with utmost anticipation. Respectfully, China Yangtze River Leading Navigation General Association. To Commander Chen Jitang of Guangzhou, Commanders Li Zongren and Bai Jiansheng of Nanning, Greetings. Previously, it was reported that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops, under the false pretense of resisting Japan, entered neighboring provinces. We jointly telegraphed them, advising them not to fall into the enemy's trap of using Chinese to control Chinese and disrupt the steps to save the nation. Later, we learned that the troops that had entered Hunan had gradually retreated. We believed that you had accepted the loyal advice of the people. Unexpectedly, recent reports indicate that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops, while pretending to retreat, were changing their route to invade the borders of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan. The nation is in such a dangerous situation. You are not thinking about uniting to resist foreign aggression but are actually rebelling against the Central Government. This was not expected by the people of the country. As the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is about to open, if you prioritize the nation, you should immediately withdraw the moving troops to their original defenses and come to the capital to attend the meeting. Discuss national policies. If you insist on using the name of resisting Japan to attempt unusual movements and destroy national strength, you will hasten your own destruction. The people of the country will no longer be able to forgive you. I am sending this sincere advice again, hoping you will consider it carefully. Respectfully, China Yangtze River Leading Navigation General Association. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Shan Zheng Trade Association and Others Telegrams: To Commander Chen Bonan of Guangzhou, and Commanders Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng, Greetings. Recent reports indicate that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops, disregarding the Central Government's warnings and the people's appeals, are continuing to advance north, claiming to save the nation while plotting rebellion. When the news arrived, we were shocked. At this time of serious national crisis, with North China on the verge of danger, the survival of the nation depends on every moment. Unity is not enough, how can we allow independent actions that hasten our own destruction? I deeply hope that you will prioritize public opinion, withdraw the moving troops, and wait for the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to resolve everything, giving the nation a chance to revive and preventing the country from suffering a disaster of division. Pull back from the brink, and it will not be too late to remedy the situation. I am sending this urgent statement, hoping you will consider it carefully. Respectfully, Shan Zheng Trade Association, Zhong Cang Association, Yan Ying Tongxing Association, Beijun An Sailors Association, Yan Ying General Association, Outer Harbor Cargo Tallying Mutual Aid Society, Taikoo Cargo Tallying Club, Yan Ying Nan Association, Commercial Shipping United Benefit Association, Shipping Industry United Benefit Association, Jianghai Lun Jardine Matheson Cargo Tallying Club.

<p>China Merchants Cargo Tallying Association Telegram: To Commander Chen Bonan of Guangdong, and Commanders Li Delin and Bai Jiansheng, Greetings. Recently, we read reports that the troops of Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, while outwardly claiming to retreat, were changing their route to advance north, invading the borders of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces. Furthermore, the vanguard troops reached Hengzhou and suddenly launched a shooting attack on the garrison troops in that city. When the news arrived, we were deeply saddened and indignant. At this time of national crisis and when the people are suffering, how can you bear to cause more war, disrupt the steps to save the nation, please the enemy, and trap the nation and the people in an irrecoverable situation? I urge you to prioritize the nation and the people, quickly withdraw the moving troops to their original locations, and wait for the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to resolve everything. Otherwise, you will be the cause of the disaster, severing yourselves from the people of the country, and you will not be able to escape the blame for destroying peace and unity, even if you have a hundred mouths. This is telegraphed with respect, China Merchants Cargo Tallying Association. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Ship Radio Operators Public Welfare Association Telegram: To the Central Executive Committee, the Nanjing Chinese Kuomintang, the National Guidance Government Military Affairs Commission, and the various ministries and commissions, Greetings. The Guangdong and Guangxi troops, disobeying orders, have arbitrarily entered Hunan Province. After repeated persuasion from the people of the country, we hoped that they would awaken. Unexpectedly, loyal words fell on deaf ears, and they stubbornly refused to change. Recently, they have mobilized troops and advanced north on a large scale, invading the borders of the three provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan. They are clearly using the beautiful name of saving the nation to attempt to undermine national unity. When the news arrived, the whole country was filled with hatred. I urge the Central Government to order a suppression, clearly punish their crimes, rectify discipline, and prevent the outbreak of chaos. The future of the Party and the nation deeply relies on this. This urgent telegram is written with utmost indignation. Respectfully, Chinese Ship Radio Operators Public Welfare Association. To Commander Chen Jitang of Guangzhou, Commanders Li Zongren and Bai Jiansheng of Nanning, Greetings. Beset by foreign troubles and with the nation in peril, the whole country should unite with sincerity and resist foreign aggression with a united force. Unexpectedly, the Guangdong and Guangxi troops suddenly changed their route to advance north, invading the borders of the provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan, disregarding the people's advice. If you are talking about saving the nation, then the Central Government has already convened the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to discuss major plans, so you should wait for the meeting to open. Why are you mobilizing troops and invading neighboring territories? It is evident that you are using the name of resisting Japan to attempt to undermine national unity, giving the enemy an opportunity and hastening your own destruction. You will be the public enemy of the nation and the criminals of the country. I hope you will respect public opinion, withdraw the moving troops within a specified time, and wait for the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to decide on major plans for saving the nation. Do not fall into the enemy's trap of using Chinese to control Chinese, which will sadden our allies and gladden our enemies. This urgent telegram is written with utmost earnestness. Respectfully, Chinese Ship Radio Operators Public Welfare Association. (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Two Railway Labor Unions Telegram: To the Party Headquarters of all provinces and cities nationwide, the governments of all provinces and cities, all special party headquarters, all armies, all organizations, all groups, and all newspapers, Greetings. The national crisis has reached its extreme. Only by consolidating unity can we talk about construction, and only by stabilizing the interior can we talk about repelling foreign aggression. Previously, the unusual movements in Guangdong and Guangxi, under the pretext of resisting the enemy, prompted the people of the whole country to send telegrams urging them to stop. The sentiments were urgent. This association has also sent two telegrams, Zhen and Geng, urging them to pull back from the brink, withdraw the forward troops, and wait for the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee to make a decision on all major plans. We also telegraphed the Central Government, requesting them to find a way to stop them. Unexpectedly, recent reports indicate that the Guangdong and Guangxi troops have begun attacking between Qiyang and Hengyang, undermining unity and willingly becoming leaders of the rebellion. The Central Government, upholding its initial goal of peace, has shown great tolerance, but Guangdong and Guangxi have disregarded public opinion, party discipline, and national law. This is truly severing themselves from the people and becoming criminals for future generations. In order to rectify discipline and prepare to save the nation, we must first eliminate the internal traitors and rebels who act as accomplices for the enemy, use false pretenses to undermine unity, and implement policies that harm the country. This association has recently telegraphed the Central Government, requesting an explicit order for suppression, stating: "To the Central Executive Committee, the National Guidance Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission, Greetings. Recent reports indicate that Guangdong and Guangxi have arbitrarily organized a military committee, and Chen Jitang has assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Guangdong-Guangxi Allied Forces. The Guangxi troops between Qiyang and Hengyang in Hunan Province have begun attacking the local garrison troops. This is enough to prove that the Guangdong and Guangxi authorities have no remorse and are disregarding public opinion, party discipline, and national law, willingly becoming the leaders of destroying peace and unity. They are willing to repeat the mistakes of the Four Garrisons at the end of the Ming Dynasty. Although the Central Government has been tolerant and has strived for peace, repeatedly advising them to reform, Guangdong and Guangxi have intensified their actions, actively invading, colluding with foreign enemies, acting as accomplices for the enemy, using false pretenses, and inciting internal strife. If such vermin are tolerated any longer, what unimaginable disasters will follow? Therefore, we specially telegram you, requesting you to quickly issue an explicit order for suppression, eliminate the rebels, consolidate unity, stabilize the interior, and repel foreign aggression. This urgent telegram is written with trepidation. May you understand. Respectfully, Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Labor Unions Directly Under the Ministry of Railways." I hope that everyone will unite in their views and issue a joint condemnation, to consolidate the foundation of the nation and suppress internal unrest. This is specially telegraphed, may you understand. Respectfully, Jinghu and Hang Railway Labor Unions Directly Under the Ministry of Railways.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Legislative Yuan to Expedite the Commercial Registration Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted another petition to the Legislative Yuan, urging the implementation of the Commercial Registration Law. The original petition stated, "Regarding the petition for a matter concerning the regulations on joint and several liability for partnership debts, which is inconvenient for business practices, a request for modification was made. Since your esteemed Yuan accepted the request from the business community and adopted the proposal of eight legislative members, including Wu Kaixian, to separately establish the Commercial Registration Law to remedy the situation, Article 9 of the draft law clarifies the names and addresses of the partners and the types and amounts of investment. If each individual has registered with the competent authority in the place of business, they may be liable for sharing losses within the limit of their investment. The general business community then decided to implement this law to ensure compliance with national conditions and business practices, while also protecting the rights of both creditors and debtors. This is thanks to the grace of your esteemed Yuan, and we celebrate with joy. However, the draft law, after being submitted to the joint meeting of the Civil Law and Commercial Law Committees in October of the 23rd year, has been stalled to this day. During this period, the affiliated associations have sent telegrams to your esteemed Yuan three times, and the Secretariat replied each time stating that the matter had been referred to the Civil Law and Commercial Law Committees for reference, but the deliberation is still indefinite, and implementation is even more delayed. The affiliated associations have repeatedly received letters from the business community expressing their expectations and inquiries, and we are at a loss for words to respond. It is said that the law reflects the will of the people, and concerning the partnership liability, it should follow customary practices. For decades, the business community has been calling for this, as evidenced by the records, and there is no need to elaborate. It is said that the law should adopt the most progressive principles in the world, and our Civil Code's Law of Obligations takes benevolence, forgiveness, and fairness, protecting the spirit of the weak, as its guiding principles, as stated at the beginning of the document. The spirit of equal protection for creditors and debtors is indeed the most progressive characteristic of our commercial law, and it is also the origin of your esteemed Yuan's compromise and separate establishment of the Commercial Registration Law. Based on these reasons, there is no reason for the draft law to be shelved. If it is said that commercial activity is sluggish and many businesses are going bankrupt, and that increasing liability is necessary to protect the rights of creditors, then in the event of business liquidation when sharing partnership liabilities, each party can take care of their due responsibilities and not evade them in the slightest. Since the strict implementation of joint and several liability, incidents of evasion have been endless, and debts are difficult to recover, which is the unanimous opinion. Strict laws are not enough to prevent abuses but are more likely to enable them. Merchants have suffered greatly from this kind of lesson and are asking for change. The legislative authorities do not seem to need to adhere to their established policies. Therefore, the 7th Members' General Assembly of this session has resolved to again request your esteemed Yuan to promptly deliberate and implement the law. A further record is made to formally petition, hoping for your review and implementation for public convenience."</p>

<h3>China Cottonseed Oil Factory Assembles National Technical Talent</h3>
<p>Actively Preparing Oil Factories in Various Locations – Cooperation with Foreign Merchants Proceeding Smoothly</p>
<p>For the purpose of improving the production and sales of tung oil and other vegetable oil materials nationwide, the Ministry of Industry, together with the provinces of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang, initiated the organization of China Vegetable Oil Factory Co., Ltd., inviting government and business to jointly invest. Preparations have been underway for over a month now, and the progress has been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. According to sources, the factory is actively negotiating the equipment of oil factories in various locations and assembling technical talent from the national oil industry to jointly contribute to the success of the plan. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Recruiting Specialized Talent: The factory's improvement plan involves many technical issues. The originally determined work steps were only general policy guidelines, and detailed rules and methods need to be researched and planned by experts. However, the number of chemical and oil material experts in our country is limited, and many are already holding important positions. Therefore, it is necessary to seek talent widely. It is learned that the factory has requested various agencies and businesses to loan specialized talent, such as Zhang Weiru, He Tuan, Lin Tianji, Liu Hu, Wu Jinquan, Wen Xiangxing, etc. All responsible parties have agreed to assist the Vegetable Oil Factory. It is said that the above experts have extensive research on vegetable oil materials. Mr. Zhang is currently in charge of tung oil inspection in Chongqing and Wuhan. Mr. Lin studied tung oil drying theory at Cornell University Graduate School in the United States and obtained a Ph.D. After returning to China, he founded the tung oil inspection work at the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau and served as the director of the manufacturing department of the Shanghai Great China Match Company. He has written books such as "The Development of Tung Oil Industry in the United States and Britain," "The Inspection Method of Mineral Oil Mixed into Tung Oil," and "The Tung Oil Industry in China," and is a well-known tung oil expert in China. Mr. Liu majored in agricultural chemistry in the United States and interned at a tung oil factory in the United States. After returning to China, he worked as a technical worker at the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau and as a professor in the chemistry department of the Agricultural College of the Central University. Mr. Wu is a Ph.D. in chemistry from Stanford University in the United States and has been a chemistry professor at Zhejiang University for many years. He has written papers such as "Research on the Chemical Composition of Tung Oil" and "The Effect of Sunlight on Tung Oil." Mr. Wen was the director of the Wuzhou Tung Oil Factory in Guangxi and was responsible for technical work. Recently, he served as a technician at the Nanchang Oil Industry Management Office. The factory's preparatory office has asked Messrs. Lin, Liu, Wu, and Wen to go to Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Zhejiang, and other provinces to contact and assist in the preparatory work in those areas. It is also heard that the factory is continuing to seek experts, striving to assemble technical talent from all over the country to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Contacting Oil Factories and Oil Pools in Various Locations: Most of the oil factories and oil pools in various parts of our country for refining and storing tung oil are owned by foreign merchants. At the beginning of the preparation, the factory sent letters to overseas merchants in various locations, asking them to list the oil pools for reference. It is learned that the factory has obtained considerable cooperation from local foreign merchants, and some merchants have expressed their willingness to transfer their oil factories and oil pools. The factory is now sending personnel to Hubei and Hunan to contact them. Those who do not want to sell are also free to do so. However, when the factory establishes oil factories in various locations in the future, it will give priority to using existing equipment to protect the interests of merchants. If the existing equipment is insufficient, then additional equipment will be added. It is heard that branch factories are planned to be established in areas along the Yangtze River, such as Chongqing, Wanxian, Yichang, Shashi, Changde, Changsha, Hankou, Laohekou, Wuhu, and Hangzhou, to expand refining and storage and facilitate the business of oil merchants.</p>
<p>Establishment Meeting Postponed: In other news, China Vegetable Oil Factory Co., Ltd. originally planned to hold an establishment meeting in the capital on July 5th of this year. It is learned that although the factory's shareholding matters have been completed, the production areas in various locations are far away, and it takes time to contact them. Furthermore, oil merchants in various locations have requested to participate. Therefore, for the sake of caution and popularizing business shares, the date of the establishment meeting has been postponed. It is expected that it will be held in July.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Ministry of Finance to Abolish the Harsh Taxes on Western Tobacco in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday petitioned the Ministry of Finance, stating, "Regarding the petition for a matter based on the facts, according to a letter from the Western Tobacco Trade Association, our Western tobacco is produced in the Gansu Gaolan Jingyuan area and sold in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the three northeastern provinces. In the past, the annual production and sales were about 30,000 dan, or 60,000 boxes, and the business value was about 5 million yuan. No less than hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly depend on it for a living. In recent years, due to rural bankruptcy and reduced purchasing power of the people, and after the September 18th Incident, the sales in the three eastern provinces were cut off due to the impact of counterfeit goods in Manchukuo. The annual business volume has decreased from 30,000 dan to more than 10,000 dan. All of these have been enough to put our industry in a precarious situation. Furthermore, various provincial governments along the route of tobacco transportation have levied various taxes on Western tobacco, each with its own name. In the most recent situation, in Gansu Province, for every 'shi' (two boxes), a public sales fee of 6 yuan, 4 fen, and 8 li must be paid to leave the city of Lanzhou. The eastern route, from Lanzhou to Shaanxi and onto the Longhai Railway, costs this amount. The northern route, from Lanzhou through Ningxia to Baotou and onto the Ping Sui Railway, costs 8 yuan, 4 fen, and 4 li. In addition, lijin on both the northeastern routes is 8 yuan, 4 jiao, 2 fen, and 4 li. Obligatory donations are 2 yuan, 8 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li on the eastern route and 3 yuan, 2 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li on the northern route. Stamp taxes are 5 jiao and 4 fen on each route. Transportation from Lanzhou, such as northward transport, passing through Ningxia, incurs a Ningxia transit tax of 4 yuan, 8 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li per dan. Transporting by train from Baotou, passing through Datong, Shanxi, requires paying a Datong tax of 4 yuan, 4 jiao, 8 fen, and 8 li per shipment. As for the eastern route, starting from Lanzhou, passing through Jingchuan, incurs a tax of 9 jiao, 3 fen, and 4 li per dan, plus a supplementary tax of 1 yuan. Passing through Changwu, Shaanxi, incurs a tax of 1 yuan and 1 jiao, 2 fen per dan. Passing through Jingyang incurs a public sales fee of 2 yuan, 1 jiao, and 6 li, plus a regular tax of 1 yuan, 3 jiao, 4 fen, and 4 li, and a stamp tax of 7 jiao. There are many other small, difficult-to-donate expenses along the way, which are all unwarranted demands. When the goods arrive in Shanghai, a special tax of seven provinces must be paid, at 14 yuan per dan. If the goods are transshipped, a transshipment tax of 2 yuan, 4 jiao, and 4 fen per dan must be paid. In total, the tax per dan is over 40 yuan, while the cost of Western tobacco itself is only about 40 yuan per dan. Therefore, many of our businesses cannot afford the burden and are losing money. Those with slightly less financial resources have successively become insolvent and closed down. In recent years, the number of formal tobacco companies has decreased from twelve to only five. Although our industry is a trading merchant, it helps tobacco farmers in the producing areas, tobacco merchants in the sales areas, and tobacco workers in the processing and manufacturing areas. If our industry collapses, hundreds of thousands of tobacco farmers, tobacco workers, and merchants who depend on it for a living will perish together. At present, our industry is in dire straits. If the harsh and miscellaneous taxes along the way can be abolished and the government's tax system can be improved, our industry will still have a glimmer of hope. For this reason, we went to Beijing to petition at the Fifth General Assembly last May, requesting the government to protect industry and explicitly abolish all harsh and miscellaneous taxes on Western tobacco, and requesting the government to change the Western tobacco tax from a special tax system to a unified tax, allowing only one production tax to be collected, which would allow free sales throughout the country. However, almost a year has passed, and there has been no news. We do not know what the government's intentions are and are deeply confused. Now that your esteemed association is convening a representative assembly, our industry hereby submits this case, requesting all representatives of the assembly to unanimously resolve to forward it to the Ministry of Finance and immediately investigate the case, clearly ordering the provincial governments through which it passes to abolish the various harsh and miscellaneous taxes on Western tobacco, and at the same time change the special tax to a unified tax, to protect industry and relieve the difficulties of merchants. When the meeting arrived, it was submitted to the 7th Members' General Assembly of the affiliated association on the 20th of this month and passed, and handed over to the Executive Committee for handling. It is found that the amount of taxes and fees collected from the transportation of the industry's Western tobacco from the producing area to Shanghai, passing through various provinces, the number of items and the amount of fees, exceeds the cost, which is truly astonishing. In the face of the government's long-standing ban on lijin and similar harsh and miscellaneous taxes, the provinces still make their own decisions to exploit merchants, not only destroying the national tax discipline but also causing the industry's last chance of survival to perish. The industry's request to abolish the harsh and miscellaneous taxes in various provinces and change the special tax to a unified tax, allowing passage throughout the country after collecting one production tax, is based on the government's tax revenue and the relief of the industry's difficulties. It is appropriate to submit a petition to your esteemed department to quickly investigate the case and send it to the provincial governments, abolish the various harsh and miscellaneous taxes on Western tobacco, and devise a unified tax collection method to protect industry and commerce for public convenience."</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Announces to All Industries that Merchants Should Restore Inherent Morality</h3>
<p>Genuine Goods, Fair Prices, and Trustworthy Commerce – There is No Other Proper Way</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday announced to all industry associations, "We hereby inform you that when the Chamber of Commerce held its Seventh Members' Representative Assembly, the Petroleum Industry Trade Association proposed that we urge all industries to respect morality, eliminate false advertising, and self-destructive competition to preserve personal integrity and consolidate the commercial foundation. It stated, 'In recent times, commercial morality has become increasingly decadent. Most industries are engaged in scheming, vying to be strange and novel, and diligently engaged in false advertising, which leads to jealousy and mutual attacks among peers. As a result, they work hard but achieve little, which is tantamount to self-harm. Not only are they unable to attract general customers, but they also leave a bad impression in the minds of customers. Thinking of this, we can't help but feel sad. It must be known that commercial competition should use reasonable scientific methods, and merely lowering prices cannot be effective. Now that various industries have industry organizations, they should take the interests of the industry as a whole as their basis, and they must not harbor small personal prejudices and take private interests as their starting point. We dare to ask your association to urge all industries to strictly implement commercial morality, refrain from false advertising, and especially eliminate price competition that is close to self-harm. Then, the commercial future will rely on it.' It is found that the inherent commercial morality of our country is genuine goods, fair prices, and trustworthy commerce. Indeed, if we want to seek the development of individual businesses, there is no other proper way other than these eight characters. Since the opening of trade, foreign merchants have also praised Chinese merchants for having the virtues of truthfulness and trustworthiness and are happy to trade with them. The commercial prosperity of various trading ports in the past was due to this. Recently, due to the global economic downturn, the organization of the business itself may not be sound, resulting in selfishness and the discovery of various bad habits such as false advertising and jealousy among peers, which is the opposite of the inherent virtues mentioned above. Seeking commercial development in this way is a far cry. We hereby send a special letter to inform you, hoping that you will check and encourage yourselves in the same industry, restore the inherent morality of merchants, and promote prosperity, which is deeply hoped for."</p>

<h3>Shenhuz Line Steamboat Companies Petition to Prohibit the Start of Early Ling Shen Service</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Suzhou-Jiaxing Second Highway, the business of the Shenhu shipping line has plummeted. It is recently heard that the Pingwang-Quanzhou-Huzhou highway will also open to automobiles, and the business will inevitably be further affected in the future. At a time when the inland river shipping industry is depressed, the spirit of self-competition among the industry is difficult to contain. It is heard that the China Merchants Steamship General Bureau and Yongshun Steamship Company in this city are planning to start an early service from Linghu to Shanghai. In order to maintain shipping safety and avoid illegal competition, they have jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Industry Trade Association with the Yuantong Steamship Bureau, Yongan Steamship Shen Bureau, Zhengchang Steamship Bureau, Hexing Steamship Bureau, and Lixing Steamship Bureau, stating that the shipping line between Linghu and Shanghai is already extremely crowded, and if new ships are added, it will not only affect the business of the original China Merchants, Yuantong, Zhengchang, Lixing, Lixing, and other five companies, but also be detrimental to transportation in both places. It is learned that the association has already submitted the situation to the Ministry of Communications, the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province, and the Ship Management Office of the Third District of Wuxing, requesting that they investigate and prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Shipping, Shipbuilding, and Insurance Industries Jointly Operate a Cooperative Dockyard Plan</h3>
<p>Hoping to Turn the Linked Business into a Three-in-One</p>
<p>The plan for the joint operation of a cooperative dockyard by the shipping, shipbuilding, and insurance industries has been passed by the General Assembly of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Trade Association and handed over to the Executive Committee for handling. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned the facts, reasons, and methods yesterday. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Facts and Reasons: (A) Facts and Reasons: Ship repair is very important. Although Shanghai is the center of private shipping, there are still few suitable private docks. If both supply and demand parties want to seek safety, economy, and convenience, it is necessary to jointly operate a "cooperative dockyard." In the shipping industry, all ships registered in Shanghai have always experienced difficulties and losses in regular annual repairs and temporary emergency repairs due to the lack of economical and convenient docks. If the factory can openly and universally solicit Shanghai shipowners to invest in the "cooperative dockyard," there will definitely be a response. The factory can take shareholder ship repair as its basic business, and it is estimated that there are about 100 ships of various sizes. Each ship repair costs about 5,000 yuan, so the annual repair fee of about 500,000 yuan can be obtained without soliciting shares. According to the investment and repair components, the distribution of profits will surely make everyone happy. In terms of the shipyard, an investigation of past facts shows that the factory lacks a dock and improvises, and may have suffered significant losses in terms of engineering and economy. For the sake of rational operation in the future, it is necessary to add a suitable dock to meet the reality and plan for development. Considering that the cost of the dock is huge, the factory is unable to complete it quickly, so it is possible to discuss with the parties in need to cooperate in the operation. (Geng San has repeatedly suggested to most shipowners and the Ship Insurance Federation and has received approval). In terms of the ship insurance industry, since the Shanghai Ship Federation was formed, it has been operating in cooperation, and its business has become increasingly developed. However, it is very difficult to inspect and repair due to the lack of a suitable dock. If the Shanghai private shipyard with technical reputation is consulted to operate a "standard" "cooperative dockyard" (accurate and economical), it can obtain the support of the Federation. It is hoped that all ships insured by the Federation will be limited to the "cooperative dockyard" and further attempts can be made. The Federation can also invest in the "cooperative dockyard" and can distribute profits according to the rules. The above four facts and reasons can be said to be an effective cooperation of the linked business and the three-in-one. The time has come, so do not let it pass by.</p>
<p>Specific Measures: (B) Methods: The Association will form a Preparatory Committee for Investment in the "Cooperative Dockyard" to first consult with a suitable Shanghai private shipyard. If it approves the principle, it will ask the factory to quickly draw up, the budget for the dock construction, the business estimate for the dock, the articles of association for soliciting shares in the "cooperative dockyard," the organization law for the "cooperative dockyard," the business, management, engineering, accounting, and various regulations for the "cooperative dockyard," the profit distribution regulations for the "cooperative dockyard" (must refer to cooperative principles and cooperative regulations), prepare the foundation for the dock, or find a way to purchase an existing suitable dock and renovate it for convenience. For the convenience of shipowners' investment, the Association should consult with appropriate business comrades and seriously suggest to the Shanghai banking group or the insurance industry to open a ship mortgage as a fund for shipowners to invest in the dock. The mortgage conditions can be strictly stipulated, because if the shipbuilding industry and the national shipping industry can be carried forward, then its development in financial insurance and production industry will also be like a shadow, and it can be guaranteed. The shipyard itself, in addition to its original business capital, should prepare one-third or one-half of the funds for the "cooperative dockyard." The shipyard should preferably consult with the banking group to do the "cooperative dockyard" mortgage. If it can be mortgaged by 50%, then the cooperative investor will be more likely to succeed (proposed by Wang Gengsan, representative of Tianjin Shipping Company).</p>
<h3>Liquidation News of Tongyi Company</h3>
<p>Insurance Clients Request the Central Trust Bureau to Take Over; Small Loans Entrusted to Shanghai Bank for Recovery</p>
<p>After the suspension of business of Tongyi Trust Company, its leased safety deposit boxes and the goods stored in its warehouses have been notified to customers to retrieve them, and most of them have been cleared. The insurance part has also been notified separately to terminate the contract or transfer the insurance. However, it is heard that the Insurance Industry Trade Association, in order to maintain the reputation of the Chinese insurance industry, will request the Central Trust Bureau to handle the aftermath and take over the insurance clients of the company. This matter is still under negotiation. As for the company's small loans, which are also a considerable amount, they have been entrusted to the Shanghai Bank to recover them for the sake of liquidation. The company's assets and liabilities are currently being compiled by the accounting firm of Xi Yushu, who is acting as the liquidator, and a shareholders' meeting will be convened within the statutory period to discuss the aftermath and decide on the liquidation method.</p>
<h3>Sea Swallow Drama Troupe's Broadcast Blocked</h3>

All of his disciples diligently learn from the spirit, like the poems of Huang Chen Feng Chao, they must return to Meishan. Creating is difficult, but describing is also not easy.

<h3>Transporting Opium in Linen Cloth? Trafficking from Sichuan Post Office to Shanghai for Sale, Police Investigation Results in Arrests</h3>
<p>Recently, Liu Lixian, a native of Sichuan, 34 years old, rented a spare room at No. 218 Baker Road and falsely established the Fuyu Yong brand, pretending to sell Xia coarse cloth as a business. However, upon actual examination, it was found to be a secret drug trafficking organization. All morphine raw materials were transported from Sichuan to Shanghai, mixed in the Xia cloth. The center of each roll of Xia cloth was hollowed out and filled with morphine, so that the appearance could not be detected. It was sent to Shanghai by mail and sold for profit. However, due to the secrecy of the matter, Wang Chengying, Zhu Shuling, and Qian Xiaoting, detectives of the Anti-Narcotics Department, discovered the secret. They reported to the First Special Court the day before and signed a search warrant. At 10:15 p.m., they secretly went to No. 218 Baker Road and arrested Zheng Qianxiu, Liu Lixian, and Liu's concubine, Huang Yueying, all three natives of Shaoxing. They seized 52 rolls of Xia cloth, of which 26 rolls each contained a package of morphine, each package weighing nine taels, totaling fourteen pounds and ten taels, as well as opium smoking paraphernalia. Then, according to Liu's confession, they went to No. 12, Lane 396, Gongguanma Road in the French Concession to arrest the same party, Zeng Nansheng (i.e., Zeng Yongsheng), a native of Hubei. Zeng had gone out and did not return home until after 1:00 a.m. yesterday, when they arrested him. They found 15 taels of raw morphine material in the sofa cushion and one roll of similarly hollowed-out Xia cloth. They were taken to the Xinzha Patrol Room separately and detained. Yesterday morning, Zhang Tianyin, a patrol room lawyer, sent them to Criminal Division 8 of the First Special Court and prosecuted them for the crime of selling opium substitutes according to Article 257, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. He also stated the case, saying that the patrol room still needed to arrest accomplices in this case, so he requested a postponement, etc. Then, he presented the Xia cloth morphine to the court. Questioning Liu Lixian, he confessed that he had been selling morphine for three months. However, all the Xia cloth was sent from Sichuan to Shanghai by mail. Zheng Qianxiu was my fellow villager. He came to Shanghai not long ago and initially went to Huiji New Hotel, but recently began to live on the third floor of my house. All the Xia cloth sent from Sichuan to Shanghai was piled up on the third floor, etc. Zheng Qianxiu confessed that he was temporarily living in Liu's house and did not know about the sale. Huang Yueying confessed that she had been acquainted with Liu for a short time and did not know about the drug trafficking either. Zeng Nansheng confessed that he sold and peddled drugs for Liu, starting on the 16th of this month. He only earned commissions and sold more than one hundred taels of morphine in total, with a selling price of seven yuan per tael, etc. Judge Huang Risheng ruled that the case would be postponed to July 3 for further interrogation. Zheng Qianxiu and Huang Yueying were released on bail of 2,000 yuan. Zheng and Zeng were returned to the patrol room for detention.</p>
<p>Regarding the price increase issue, evidence should be collected to verify whether the company's income exceeds 10% in order to file a negotiation, etc. Accordingly, in addition to notifying users to quickly report the new price payment bills and the situation of inaccurate accounting and exceeding the number of times to the Special District Telephone Problem Committee in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce in Tianhougong Bridge, the number so far is small and cannot verify whether the company's income exceeds 10%. Therefore, according to the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase law passed by the Public Works Department Board of Directors, the attached conditions, Section 2, "According to the contract signed between the company and the Public Works Department, assuming that the income exceeds one point, the company should waive one-half of the excess amount," Section 3, "All expenses of the company should be reduced as much as possible," and Section 4, "If the future income exceeds one point, the Public Works Department should immediately convene a board of directors meeting to re-discuss reducing telephone charges," etc., in order to facilitate the collection of user documents, all industry associations are requested to notify their members to send the telephone bills to the Chamber of Commerce so that a letter can be sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to request the Public Works Department Board of Directors to re-negotiate and reduce telephone charges, etc. Accordingly, we hereby request that you follow the instructions.</p>
<p>User Report</p>
<p>The Special District Telephone Problem Committee received a letter from the Children's Bookstore on Sima Road yesterday, saying that the "91923" telephone installed in our store, in addition to the fixed price in the previous month, if we add the charge for Huajie telephones according to regulations at nine cents each time, the monthly calculation only requires about nineteen yuan, and at most it is only sixteen or seventeen yuan. This time, after the company changed the new regulations, the monthly telephone bill suddenly increased to thirty yuan and some odd cents. It was found that our store counted a total of 485 calls from February 21 to April 20 this year, excluding the 150 calls that should be made within the rules, exceeding 335 times. According to the company's new single three cents each time, it is 10.005 yuan, plus the fixed fee of 10 yuan, it is only 20 yuan and odd cents. However, the company's bill from March 17 to April 16 shows 636 excess calls, a difference of 301 calls. Also, from April 22 to May 20, the count was 361 calls, excluding the number of calls that should be made, exceeding 211 times, while the company's bill from April 17 to September 16 shows 522 excess calls, a difference of 311 calls. Moreover, our store records each telephone call on a nameplate. We questioned the company directly last month. The company was nothing more than covering up with evasive words, only using the counting meter installed in the company as proof. At that time, we asked them to also install a counting meter on our store's telephone to verify, but the company did not give a clear answer, which is very sad. If this continues, the losses will be countless. Therefore, we enclose two copies of the new price payment bill and request that you uphold justice and negotiate according to reason, etc.</p>
<h3>Mirage Discovered Outside Wusong Estuary Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Buildings and Pavilions Clearly Discernible, Figures Coming and Going Faintly Visible</p>
<p>A mirage phenomenon was discovered near the Gaoqiao coast outside the Wusong Estuary at about 1:30 p.m. yesterday. At that time, majestic and magnificent architectural giant shadows suddenly appeared in the vast ocean, towering into the clouds. Due to the dazzling sunlight, the buildings were in five colors, purple, gold, etc. Among them, buildings and pavilions, carved beams, were clearly discernible, and figures coming and going were faintly visible. For a time, many villagers gathered to watch. However, because it was very temporary and disappeared in a few minutes, those who arrived later were unable to fully enjoy the spectacle and felt deeply regretful, it is said.</p>
<h3>Re-equipping of Flatbed Cart Wheels Comes to a Satisfactory End</h3>
<p>Previous Proposal Indefinitely Postponed</p>
<p>Regarding the re-equipping of flatbed cart wheels in the Public Concession, the Flatbed Cart Industry Mutual Aid Association repeatedly petitioned the Public Works Department to temporarily exempt them from re-equipping. Recently, the department's security committee convened a meeting to discuss it. As a result, the previous proposal that all carts should be equipped with angle iron wheels at least 3.5 inches wide or solid rubber tires at least 1 inch wide starting on July 1 of the Japanese year was deemed sufficient to increase the burden on cart merchants and difficult to implement under the current situation. It was resolved to petition the Board of Directors to indefinitely postpone the previous proposal, and the current regulations for flatbed carts and other vehicles will also not be revised for the time being. It is also heard that the Public Works Department Board of Directors, when holding a regular meeting yesterday, had approved the proposal of the Security Committee. Therefore, the re-equipping of flatbed cart wheels has come to a satisfactory end.</p>

<h3>Homeless People in the Xiqin Institute Beat a Patrolman to Death, Interrogation</h3>
<p>Gao Fuxiang, Pan Qianhe Shou, Hong Jianfu, etc., homeless people taken in by the homeless people's Xiqin Institute in Caohe, and Yao Benren, Gao Yongling, Wu Ruilin, etc., who were at large, because of digging a hole and escaping resistance to arrest, designed to beat Patrolman Lu Yecai to death. At that time, Gao Fuxiang, Pan Heshou, and Hong Jianfu were arrested, and Yao Benren, Gao Yongling, Wu Ruilin, etc., fled. They were sent to the local court for investigation and were prosecuted for murder. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Yongzhou held a court hearing. Gao Fuxiang confessed that he was 22 years old, a local, living at No. 177 Tangjiawan, and worked in a rice shop. The official asked why he was sent to the Homeless People's Xiqin Institute. He replied that he was addicted to gambling and was sent to the Public Security Bureau by his father on December 5 last year and transferred to the Xiqin Institute. The official asked why he wanted to kill Patrolman Lu Yecai. He replied that it was not his idea, it was Tao Benren and Wu Ruilin who came up with the idea. On February 3, because they wanted to dig a hole and escape, Wu Ruilin suggested tying up Lu Yecai. Therefore, Yao Benren covered Lu's head with a blanket, and Lu shouted. Gao Yongling started to beat him, and Hong Jianfu was guarding the door. Because Lu kept shouting, we were afraid of making noise and not following, so Wu Ruilin and I each held iron rods and files to beat him. After we left, he was not dead yet. The official asked what Pan Heshou was doing at that time. He replied that he was helping Yao Benren cover Lu's head. The official asked how many times he hit him. He replied that he hit him once, and Wu Ruilin hit him three times. The official asked why they wanted to escape. He replied that it was because the institute was so painful that they were beaten if they were not careful. The official asked if they would pay for killing someone with their lives. He replied that he had no choice. At this point, Pan Heshou confessed that he was 22 years old and a native of Taiyu. Because of wandering and gambling, his father, Pan Donggen, sent him to the Xiqin Institute in May last year. The official asked that his father sent him because he meant well. Why did he escape? He replied, yes, I did not come up with the idea. At that time, when they discussed escaping, I said that if things did not work out, they would be beaten. So I was advising them, but they would not listen. At that time, because it was difficult to open the hole for a while, Hong Jianfu pretended to be sick and slept on the bed, covering it with a quilt. Then Patrolman Lu Yecai came to check on them, and they beat him. After they left, I followed them out and was arrested, etc. Hong Jianfu, 18 years old, from Cixi, parents died, married, has a sister and a brother, studying in Annam, came to Shanghai for only more than ten days, living at No. 469 Jiangxi Road. Because he had no job, he voluntarily went to the institute to learn skills and did mechanical work on April 5 of the noon year. I did not dare to oppose what they did, nor did I dare to report it. I did not know the roads in Shanghai, and I had no money, so I did not conspire with them, etc. According to Patrolman Sun Jinhai and Liu Shangzhi of the institute, Lu Yecai was injured on February 3 and died the next day. The official ruled that the case would be investigated and interrogated again, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Liu Huizhi, Accused of Embezzlement and Breach of Trust, Continued Trial Yesterday</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Asks the Judge to Detain Liu Because the Case is Serious</p>
<p>Liu Huizhi, chairman and general manager of the Zhong 　 Industrial Bank, a native of Anhui, 　was sued by shareholders Xiang Jiewan, Weng Pengnian, Zhu Junping, Yan Jiquan, Yan Shuyi, and Chen, a lawyer, for embezzling the letter of credit in the First Special District Court, reaching seven articles. Then, He and others added a lawsuit against Li Jizhi, the current managing director of the Yihang Bank, and listed him as a joint defendant. The court once summoned him, but because the defendant did not arrive,　 ordered a rescheduling of the trial. All the details have been reported in the 16th edition of this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan of 　 Criminal Division 8 continued the trial. Liu Huizhi arrived in court with his defense lawyer, and Li Jizhi did not arrive, but entrusted a lawyer to represent him. Liu's lawyer then raised a procedural issue, saying that Zhang Chongfu, a shareholder of the former China Industrial Bank, loved His Honor's accusations against Liu. Five of the facts he sued were completely identical to those sued in this case. After His Honor believed that it should first be determined whether there was a right to sue under civil law, I ruled to suspend the trial. Now that the civil case has not been determined, according to law, the five articles of the same case, since they belong to the same facts and the same defendant, should also be suspended, etc. The plaintiff argued that because there were two cases and the plaintiffs were not the same, they were not bound by the previous ruling. The lawyers on both sides had a long and fierce debate on this issue based on legal precedents. Judge Tan ruled that whether or not to suspend the trial on these five items should be determined by the court separately, and the remaining items still needed to collect evidence, so he ruled to reschedule the trial and wait for further summons. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that on the surface, the amount of Liu Huizhi's embezzlement was four or five million, but in reality, it was more than tens of millions. Therefore, the circumstances of the case were serious, and he requested that the defendant be detained. Judge Tan then asked Liu if he could be present every time he was summoned in the future. Liu said he would definitely be able to appear in court. The court then ruled that the trial should be suspended for paragraphs one to five as filed by the plaintiff, and the remaining paragraphs should be suspended for further investigation, and then adjourned to await further summons.</p>
<h3>A Thief Carelessly Touched the Back Door Lock; Remaining Thieves Panicked and Jumped Out of the Building</h3>

<p>The Victim Personally Testified in Court</p>
<p>The thieves, Zhang Xiaodi from Jiaxing, Wang Laowu and Zhong Jinsheng from Suzhou, and Shen Zhangsheng (at large), at 11:20 PM, carried axes to the Hu Qing Tobacco and Paper Shop at No. 245 Han Road. They broke in through the back door, threatened to silence the occupants with axes, and robbed approximately thirty yuan in banknotes and coins. Shen, the first thief to flee through the back door, inadvertently triggered the spring lock, causing panic among the other three thieves. Fearing that the police would arrive from the front to arrest them, they hastily went upstairs and jumped from the曬tai, attempting to escape. Zhang Xiaodi fell and injured his head, fainting on the spot. Zhong Jinsheng suffered a jaw injury and hid in a narrow alley in Huasheng Road’s Xieyu Lane. Wang Laowu sustained a minor waist injury and barely managed to return home to No. 76 Yangzhou Road. At that time, the Yulin Road police station received a report and dispatched Detective Li Hongsheng and other Western detectives to investigate. Near the shop's back door, they found Zhang Xiaodi lying on the ground, attempting to get up and leave. He was immediately arrested and searched, revealing sixteen yuan and six jiao in stolen coins. Questioning him revealed that his accomplices were hiding at No. 76 Yangzhou Road, where Wang was also arrested. Zhong was later apprehended in Xieyu Lane on Huasheng Road, and one yuan and nine jiao in stolen coins were found on him. An axe was also recovered from the shop's 曬tai. All were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Special First Court. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the events and requested an extension for investigation. Hu Qingping, the shop owner, and Detective Li testified about the incident, presenting the axe and stolen coins as evidence. Judge Jiang Shuzi questioned the three defendants, ordering them to be remanded in custody for further review.</p>

<p>Sun Guixian, a prostitute at the Xie Di Laojiu brothel at No. 9 Fuzhou Road’s Huile Lane, 18 years old and residing on the second floor of No. 93 Tai’an Lane, Santai Road, Hongkou, was targeted by criminals Xu Baohua and Zhu Changfu from Yangzhou, due to her fashionable attire and jewelry. Xu and Zhu, both leatherworkers who set up stalls at the entrance of Tai’an Lane, were dazzled by Sun's jewelry, assuming she must be from a wealthy family. They were unaware that all her jewelry was counterfeit. On the morning of the previous day, around 9 AM, they gathered several of their colleagues, armed themselves, and forcibly entered Sun's residence. They confined everyone in the room to a corner and began robbing them. They stole a洋金ring worth thirty-four yuan, three pairs of fake pearl earrings, six pairs of fake鑽earrings, and three pairs of fake jade earrings from the houses of Sun Guibao and Sun Yongxin, both on the upper and lower floors. They gleefully fled to Room 14 of the Xiao Qiao Inn on Xizang Road, intending to divide the loot.

<h3>Xiang Stage Smashed</h3>
<p>Three Policemen Beaten; Spectators Caught in the Crossfire</p>
<p>Several people went to watch a play at the Xiang Stage at No. 2 Tianshi Road, Zhabei, during the Dragon Boat Festival. A minor disagreement with the tea servers arose, and the stage manager, Qu Hongxi, apologized to resolve the matter. Unexpectedly, around 8 PM last night, the stage was suddenly attacked. A spectator in the pool seats, wearing yellow shorts and a black long衫, initiated the questioning of why the fans were not turned on. While speaking, he proceeded to dismantle the electric fans. The stage staff and tea servers naturally stepped forward to stop him and negotiate, but before words could be exchanged, a brawl erupted. Other spectators, fearing for their safety, scrambled to escape, creating a chaotic and noisy scene. The performance on stage was also halted. The brawlers, seeing the play had stopped, seized the opportunity to rush onto the stage and tear down the scenery. At that moment, Wu Changhong, the stage's security guard, realizing the situation was beyond control, frantically blew the警笛for help and held the iron gate to prevent the rioters from escaping. Police officer No. 26, patrolling from the Linping Road police station, and the police at the Tianbing Road post, arrived first. As they prepared to enter and suppress the riot, the perpetrators charged out of the venue, mistaking the officers for their targets. Without inquiry, they attacked the three officers with wooden sticks and槍柄, injuring all three. By the time a large contingent of police from the Linping Road police station arrived, the rioters had fled without a trace. The injured officers and spectators/stage employees Wang Hanzhang, Liu Guanchang, Zhong Wenlong, Huang Shifu, Zhu Chunjiang, and Wang Zhangshi were immediately transported to Tongren Hospital. Another seven or eight people with minor injuries went home to treat themselves. An investigation into the damage and the whereabouts of the perpetrators was launched to bring them to justice.

<h3>Shanghai's Oil Extraction Industry</h3>
<p>— Edited by China Credit</p>
<p>(Summary of Shanghai Industry and Commerce 29)</p>
<p>2. Raw Materials</p>
<p>Shanghai's oil extraction industry is quite similar to the flour industry, that is, the flour industry often stops business due to a decrease or severance in the supply of wheat. The oil extraction industry also often cannot continue production due to a lack of various plant seeds, so the supply of raw materials is closely related to the future of the industry. The main products of Shanghai's oil extraction plants are cottonseed oil, soybean oil, vegetable oil, and rapeseed oil. Now, the supply of raw materials will be analyzed below:</p>
<p>1. Cottonseed: The raw material for cottonseed oil is cottonseed, which is attached to the cotton boll. According to its color, it is divided into two types: green, black, and white. The oil quality of green is the best. According to its type, there are differences between American cotton, Indian cotton, and Egyptian cotton, etc. The Egyptian cottonseed has the most oil, about 16%. As for the cottonseed needed in this city, there are three sources: one is the cotton-growing areas of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Shaanxi, with an annual amount of more than 2 million loads; the second is the Shaoxing and Yuyao area of Zhejiang, with an annual amount of only 200,000 loads; and the third is the newly reclaimed cotton area north and south of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu, with an annual amount of 800,000 loads. Hebei and Shandong were originally vast cotton-producing areas, second only to the Northwest, but because the Japanese rose up to monopolize them, they are almost useless to my country's oil extraction industry. In addition to competing for our country's raw materials, it also has the incidental effect of monopolizing our country's cottonseed, which will inevitably hinder our country's or this city's oil extraction industry no less than the cotton textile industry, which is neglected by Chinese people and should be given more attention.</p>
<p>2. Soybeans: The raw material for soybean oil is soybeans. There are many types of soybeans, which can be roughly divided into four types: yellow soybeans, Jinyuan, Bai Mei, and Hei Qi. Yellow soybeans are the most common soybeans, with the largest yield, and are also the main raw material for soybean oil. Jinyuan is named for its yellow color and round shape, and contains a lot of oil. Bai Mei is also known as Bai Ban or Da Bai Mei. Hei Qi is also known as Hei Fu, with a white tendon on one abdomen and a dark brown tendon on the other. The oil content is more than Jinyuan. My country is the country with the most abundant soybean production, such as the four provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangsu in the Yangtze River Basin, and the three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi in the Yellow River Basin, all of which produce soybeans. However, the soybeans produced in the Northeast are the most abundant. In addition to a part of the soybeans needed in this city being supplied by Jiangsu Province, the rest are purchased from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Jinpu area.</p>
<p>3. Peanuts: Vegetable oil is peanut oil, and its raw material is peanuts without shells. The quality is determined by the number of grains contained in each ounce. Generally, the best is 28 grains per ounce, and the worst is 40 or 50 grains per ounce. The former can extract 60 catties of oil per load, and the latter can extract 30 catties of oil per load. Ordinary peanuts can extract 50 catties of oil. The climate and soil of each province in my country are generally suitable for cultivating peanuts, so peanut production is almost all over the country. However, Shandong produces the most, with an annual output of more than 170 million loads. Hunan and Fujian provinces produce the least, about 1 million loads per year. Most of the peanuts needed in this city are traded in Qingdao and Xuzhou.</p>
<p>4. Rapeseed: Rapeseed is the raw material for rapeseed oil. The vegetables that produce the rapeseed are mainly rapeseed, which is called rapeseed by the local people. Now, the types and the amount of oil contained in each type when dried are listed as follows:</p>
<p>The important producing areas of rapeseed are the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the oil in Jin, Lu, and Ji is sold inland, replacing the position of soybean oil as fuel, so soybean oil in the inland is currently only used for cooking, so most of the rapeseed is also imported into this city from the countryside.</p>
<p>In addition, coconut oil has been produced in this city in recent years, and it is heard that under the support of the business department, a tung oil factory may appear soon, so we cannot ignore the two raw materials, coconut and tung seeds. In addition, in addition to the cottonseed being mainly purchased from various yarn factories in this city, the remaining oil extraction raw materials mentioned above are all purchased by the factory by sending personnel to the inland. Some inland merchants also sell to oil factories in this city, and the miscellaneous grain stores in this city often operate in the operation of these raw materials. (To be continued)</p>
<p>The Road to Health</p>
<h3>A New Medicine for Radically Curing Gonorrhea and Turbidity</h3>
<p>Only "Cleanon" deserves the name</p>
<p>Disease requires medicine, and if the medicine is compatible with the condition, it will be effective quickly. On the contrary, if the medicine is not suitable or if the medicine is taken without effect, it will increase the disease. This is not only the case with all diseases, but especially with gonorrhea. Therefore, for gonorrhea, the selection of medicine must be more cautious, because taking medicine for gonorrhea that is not compatible will increase its changes.</p>
<p>The so-called ideal effective drug for treating gonorrhea is to kill bacteria, resist gonorrhea, and reduce inflammation. Such drugs were previously only an ideal. Now the ideal has become a reality, namely, the drug "Cleanon" invented by Luo Bide. "Cleanon" not only contains the effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, but also can produce an anti-toxic immune effect in the body after taking it. Therefore, wherever there are gonococci, they will be surrounded and killed by "Cleanon". Its healthy parts can still be unharmed. It is effective for acute anterior urethritis, chronic posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, etc. These effects have long been proven by the world's major famous doctors. It can be called an outstanding new drug for treating gonorrhea. As for women who suffer from gonorrheal leukorrhea, it is also most suitable for taking. On the one hand, use "Carder Shirley vaginal tablets", take one tablet and insert it into the vagina every night, and it can be completely cured in a few weeks. Now, more than 10,000 people in our country have been cured by taking "Cleanon".</p>
<h3>Stomach Disease Due to Special Causes</h3>
<p>Stomach disease has several special causes, such as when the saliva of smokers is swallowed, it stimulates the inner surface of the stomach and causes catarrh. Also, chronic stomach catarrh is often caused by regular drinking of alcohol. Vomiting a large amount of mucus in the morning is called the morning vomiting of drunks. Other diseases of the liver, kidneys, lungs, and heart are also often accompanied by stomach problems, so stomach disease is a symptom that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The main treatment for stomach disease is, of course, to reduce irritation in the stomach and transform its function. If the stomach disease is caused by lesions of other organs, you can first increase your appetite and increase your food intake, hoping for good nutrition? It is easy to recover health. The "Strong Stomach Medicine" of France's Florence has the function of improving digestive function, increasing appetite, and reducing intestinal yeast gas, so it is effective for acute and chronic stomach catarrh, stomach cramps, stomach expansion, etc., with symptoms such as chest burning, noise and vomiting, acid regurgitation, 噯气、逆饱满, bloating after meals, vague abdominal pain, fear of seeing food, as well as intestinal sound diarrhea, constipation, and a lot of cold farts, all have miraculous effects. This medicine is a compound preparation of yeast. The ingredients of yeast, such as vitamins A, B, and D, all have valuable tonifying power, and can especially cure beriberi with a lack of vitamin B, which has excellent results. Among them, it also contains egg yolk lecithin, which is a good product for constipation or quitting smoking, and can also treat infant regurgitation and green stool, etc., and because it is rich in nutrients, it has a greater tonic effect than other agents, and can be used as a food for maintaining health throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Rescue of Developmental Disorders</h3>
<p>Developmental disorders are the greatest suffering of modern humans, especially for young men and women during the period of development. Observing the reasons for these non-developments, they are mostly due to excessive self-abuse and early marriage. Excessive sex leads to incomplete development of the lower body like ordinary people, so the body is also short and unsound. The development of a person is entirely due to endocrine relations, and the reproductive glands in the endocrine are especially important for the development of reproduction, often because these glands are injured and induce spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, unsound erectile power of the lower part, palpitation, dizziness, insomnia, headache, easy movement of anger, irritable mood. Doing things has no beginning and no end, and it is easy to be pessimistic. Other things, such as the lack of memory, the yellow complexion, the dull lip color, the backache, and the weakness of the limbs, are often seen in people with incomplete development. As for women, the menstruation is chaotic, and the buttocks and breasts cannot develop normally.</p>
<p>Merlin氏, in view of the fact that men and women are sinking into the sea of suffering, decided to work hard to research and invent the two medicines "Buti Kang" for men and "Bu Nu Rong" for women, which are made from the testicles and ovaries of brave male and female beasts, and hormones are extracted and made separately using the species method. The function is to promote the vigorous function of internal secretion, so that all parts of the human body can reach the complete state of development. And diseases such as spermatorrhea are also cured at the same time. As for menstrual disorders, leukorrhea, and infertility after a long marriage, after taking "Bu Nu Rong", they can also achieve the purpose of cure in a few weeks. It can also make the muscles plump and delicate, the blood color full of the face, and increase the interest in doing things, and increase work efficiency. It is not only about getting rid of the disease.</p>
<h3>The Fundamental Solution to Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>The cause of nocturnal emission is due to masturbation damaging sexual function, leading to laxity of the seminal ducts and frequent nocturnal emissions, which result in neurasthenia, such as a sharp decline in memory, headaches, dizziness, anemia, and emaciation. Therefore, this condition is indeed a major human ailment.</p>
<p>Existing preparations, those with stable efficacy may not be quick-acting, while those with rapid effects may not be purely natural. Nai's "Sperm-Nourishing Pills" are indeed capable of fundamentally resolving nocturnal emission. Regardless of the frequency of nocturnal emissions, daytime seminal dribbling, or sperm leakage during bowel movements or exertion, and the resulting neurasthenia, they are all effectively treated. Furthermore, they can reduce excessive stimulation of the central nervous system, thus helping to stop masturbation. Truly a royal and virtuous product. Available at Chinese and Western pharmacies.</p>
<h3>What is the Most Effective Treatment for Gonorrhea?</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is not difficult to treat in its acute stage, but once it becomes chronic, a complete cure is particularly difficult. This is because acute gonorrhea affects the anterior urethra, while chronic gonorrhea affects the posterior urethra or spreads to the whole body. Systemic gonococcal infections, such as septicemia and angina, are especially dangerous, posing a risk to life. Other conditions such as blindness and arthritis often lead to disability. Therefore, gonorrhea must be fundamentally resolved. However, people often think that taking one or two bottles of medicine in the acute stage is enough, but in reality, the gonococcal toxins are not completely eliminated and will recur when the opportunity arises. Therefore, treating gonorrhea should not rely solely on local "membrane-penetrating sterilization." It is essential to eliminate toxins from the entire body.</p>
<p>Based on animal experiments, the elimination of gonococci is entirely due to the generation of "complement fixation," which is the bacteriolytic effect produced in the serum. The pharmacology and therapeutic effect of "Kelinong" lie in its ability to induce bacteriolysis in the serum and produce "complement fixation." Therefore, its eradication of gonococci is unimaginably powerful. Moreover, its medicinal power does not directly stimulate the affected area but guides the body's "immune elements" to engulf the bacterial toxins. Therefore, the medicinal properties are royal, virtuous, and pure, without causing stomach upset or any adverse effects. However, it is important to note that when purchasing, be sure to recognize the three characters "Kelinong" and do not treat it lightly, or be deceived by other products or listen to others and purchase cheap, miscellaneous, and inferior medicines, which could endanger your life. This cannot be overemphasized. European countries recognize "Kelinong" as the most appropriate and effective preparation. Whether it is acute or chronic gonorrhea in men and women, as well as cystitis, orchitis, prostatitis, and arthritis, as well as uterine gonorrhea and vulvar gonorrhea in women, can all be cured with this medicine, completely eradicated in a short period, and will not recur.</p>
<h3>How to Overcome Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>Leukorrhea in women is an extremely lingering and unpleasant condition. However, because it is common, it is often ignored, leading to pathological changes unnoticed. For example, if the vaginal tract is dirty, it is easily attacked by bacteria, causing inflammation and erosion, affecting urination, lower abdominal distension and discomfort, and menstrual irregularities, leading to infertility.</p>
<p>"Cardiol-Shepherd's Vaginal Tablets" are a sacred product for cleansing leukorrhea. It functions to cleanse secretions in the vaginal cavity, heal wounds, and eliminate bacteria. One tablet can be inserted locally every night, and washed away the next morning. The usage is simple, and it can be treated secretly at home. However, for those infected with gonorrhea by their husbands, "Kelinong" can be taken concurrently to eliminate the internal gonococcal toxins. For those caused by weakness, "Bunuri" can be taken concurrently to strengthen the body and regulate menstruation. With this regimen, it can be cured in a short period. It is truly a sacred medicine for overcoming leukorrhea.</p>
<h3>The Theory and Treatment of Prolonged Cough Turning into Consumption</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, "A cold that doesn't clear up becomes consumption." This is because a cold can cause catarrh of the trachea. If it is not treated promptly, it will develop into a prolonged cough, and tuberculosis bacteria will take the opportunity to become active, eroding the lung tissue and multiplying. Thus, the lungs are damaged, resulting in pulmonary tuberculosis, sudden hemoptysis, or without any particular reason, loss of appetite, and nausea and night sweats. The cough worsens daily, with increasing phlegm, sometimes mixed with blood, and difficulty breathing. Consequently, anemia and emaciation lead to groaning in bed. All things must be carefully addressed at the beginning. If the initial stage of the disease is not treated properly, it has a profound impact on life. Therefore, you must seek medical attention quickly. However, among the medications, only "Bupenaal" from the Farault Pharmaceutical Factory can achieve the goal of treating the disease if you have it and preventing tuberculosis if you don't. It is highly effective. The principle of curing chronic coughs and internal injuries is to quickly eliminate inflammation of the trachea and increase the calcium content in the lungs, so the cough will naturally subside, and tuberculosis can be prevented. "Kakpenaali" contains a large amount of calcium, which helps to increase the calcium content to fill in the scars in the lungs, so that tuberculosis bacteria cannot carry out their activity and are ultimately trapped within, lacking a supply of nutrients, and thus starve to death. Moreover, "Bupenaal" can promote the absorption of food and produce strong blood cells, so even though the tuberculosis toxins are fierce, they cannot but be eliminated by the body's powerful immune system. Therefore, this medicine has remarkable effects on pulmonary tuberculosis with hemoptysis, coughing, and excessive phlegm, chest pain, night sweats, fatigue, emaciation, and anemia. It is also effective in treating stubborn conditions such as whooping cough and asthma. In cases of pulmonary tuberculosis with neurasthenia, insomnia and palpitations are often seen, and men may also have nocturnal emissions and lower back pain. "Buteikon" can be taken with this medicine to stop nocturnal emissions and strengthen the brain. If women also suffer from menstrual disorders, "Bunuritsu" can be taken concurrently to nourish the blood and regulate menstruation. Then, physical strength will be strong, resistance will be high, and the original health will be restored and enhanced.</p>

<h3>Public Testimony of the Effectiveness of "Kelinong"</h3>
<p>Urine Like a Thread</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Tongnian had suffered from gonorrhea for many years and relapsed due to promiscuity. As a result, both the anterior and posterior urethras were infected, and the urethra was constricted, causing the urine to be as thin as a thread and containing sediment like floating dander. There was also stinging pain in the penis, causing him great distress. Introduced by his friend Mr. Wu Luodian, he purchased and took "Kelinong" for about two weeks, and the pain and itching subsided. Urination became much easier, so he continued to take it for three weeks to ensure a complete cure. As a result, the gonococcal discharge was eliminated, and the urine became clear. After examination by a doctor, the gonococci were completely eradicated. Mr. Chen was overjoyed and praised the effectiveness of "Kelinong" to everyone he met.</p>
<p>Dripping Pus</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Fuping had previously contracted gonorrhea. Initially, he experienced frequent and burning urination. Then, pus was found at the urethral opening, with turbid fluid dripping. He was prone to erections, but they were painful. Urination was unnatural, the foreskin was swollen, and the urine contained blood, causing great pain. Later, hearing of the remarkable efficacy of "Kelinong," he immediately purchased three bottles. Before he finished the medicine, the pus discharge decreased, and the pain subsided. Therefore, he continued to take a large dose with peace of mind. After about five bottles, the swelling subsided, the urine cleared, and all symptoms disappeared. It has been half a year since then, and it has not recurred, confirming that it has been completely eradicated.</p>
<p>Continued Treatment</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Yuanquan, age 20, had contracted gonorrhea last year, with pus flowing directly. Knowing it early, he sought treatment from Dr. Yao Juyan, and he fully recovered in about four weeks. Later, he engaged in unprotected sex, resulting in a recurrence of gonorrhea. After taking several bottles of "Kelinong," he saw its effectiveness. Therefore, he continued to take it to prevent other complications and seek a fundamental cure.</p>
<p>Testicular Hardness and Pain</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Lüguang, age 32, had suffered from gonorrhea for eight years and experienced much pain. Recently, his left testicle suddenly became swollen, red, enlarged, and burning. Walking was difficult, and he also suffered from headaches and limb pain. During bowel movements or exertion, sperm dribbled with pus. Every morning, the urethral opening was sealed with pus, confining him to bed and causing unspeakable pain. Later, a colleague told him to take "Kelinong." After taking four bottles, the testicular swelling gradually subsided, and the pus discharge disappeared. Later, he also took "Buteikon" concurrently to strengthen his body. After taking several bottles of each medicine, the swelling disappeared, his body was strong, and he returned to work as usual, with his spirits a hundredfold.</p>
<p>Self-Cured</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Sufeng contracted leukorrhea due to promiscuity. Carelessly, he transmitted it to his wife, causing her to also suffer from gonococcal leukorrhea, menstrual irregularities, foul discharge, lower abdominal swelling, painful urination, and itchy, ulcerated, and moist vulva, making it difficult to sit or lie down. Her underpants were stained, causing others to cover their noses. Multiple treatments were ineffective. Later, because Mr. Zhang took "Kelinong" and recovered from the gonococcal discharge, she also imitated him and took it, while also using "Cardiol-Shepherd's Vaginal Tablets" externally, inserting one or two tablets into the vagina every night before bed. Before and after use, she washed with boiling water. After a month, the leukorrhea stopped, the menstrual cycle regulated, the ulcerated condition completely healed, and the pain and itching disappeared. The couple praised it endlessly.</p>
<p>Turbid Sperm Leakage</p>
<p>Patient Qin Shufeng had suffered from gonorrhea for several years, which was not cured after prolonged treatment. His body became increasingly weak. Every morning, the urethral opening was sealed with pus, making it difficult to urinate. The urine trickled out, sometimes containing blood. He also suffered from nocturnal emissions at night, and itching and pain in the penis, making him mentally exhausted. After taking four bottles of "Kelinong," the gonococcal discharge disappeared. Fearing a recurrence, he continued to take several more bottles, while also taking "Buteikon" to treat the weakness. After several weeks, he was completely cured.</p>

<h3>Yao Juyan, MD, Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Treatment of Chronic Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Once gonorrhea becomes chronic, complications arise endlessly. The reason why chronic gonorrhea is difficult to cure lies in this. Generally, at the onset of gonorrhea, the lesions are mostly located in the anterior part of the urethra. At this time, the gonococcal toxins have not yet established a base, making it easiest to expel them. This is because the tissue of the anterior urethra is very simple, and it is not easy for gonococci to hide. Once it becomes chronic, the gonococci move from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra and then invade the testicles, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and paraurethral ducts.</p>
<p>The most obvious symptom of chronic gonorrhea is the absence of severe pain during the acute stage. Sometimes it is subtle or nonexistent, with only one or two drops of leukorrhea. Often, the external symptoms are almost nonexistent, and it only flares up after being stimulated. If the patient's urine is examined under a microscope, many gonococci will be found in the urine. Because these bacteria are always attached to the mucous membrane of the urethra, they are often discharged during urination and ejaculation, making it very easy to infect the opposite sex.</p>
<p>Special methods must be used to treat this type of chronic gonorrhea. In my clinical practice, I always use anti-gonococcal serum and X-rays to eliminate gonococci, and supplement them with electrotherapy and effective oral medications for gonorrhea, all of which can be cured in the shortest possible time. This is because these treatments adopt an encirclement policy, making it impossible for gonococci to escape. As for women suffering from gonococcal leukorrhea, effective oral medications for gonorrhea can be taken internally, and vaginal tablets can be used externally, which can also achieve a radical cure in a short period.</p>

<h3>Venue for the Next Olympic Games Mr. Bailaila expresses his views. He doesn't want to express his opinion alone because of his duty. A three-way race often makes it easier to see each other's strengths and weaknesses</h3>
<p>Paris, June 24 (Havas) - Count Bailaila, Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, recently stated to a reporter from this agency, "The venue for the 12th Olympic Games in 1940 is being contested by the United Kingdom, Japan, and Finland. As Chairman of the International Olympic Committee, it is not convenient for me to express my opinion alone and hastily consider which country is more suitable. I have just returned from the capital of Finland and found that the country has all the conditions to host the next Games. Now the United Kingdom has also made the same request, so we should discuss it carefully. However, this move by the United Kingdom has not reduced Japan's chances of hosting the next Games, because, according to common sense, it is easier to see each other's strengths and weaknesses when there are three parties competing than when there are only two parties."</p>

<h3>China Insurance Company Underwrites Group Life Insurance for the World Games Delegation</h3>

It is reported that the company believes that this is a service to promote mutual assistance life insurance by the government and sports people, so the fees are low.</p>
<h3>Olympics - An Explanation of Diving Competitions and Illustrations of Various Dives (1)</h3>
<p>— Qian Yidong</p>
<p>A Few Words</p>
<p>The English word "Diving" is often translated by our countrymen as "entering the water" (as seen in the current swimming rules). Upon careful consideration, this seems inappropriate. It would be better to call it "leaping into the water" (躍水). The character "躍" (yue) implies the meaning of a fish leaping. From a specialized perspective, the core of diving truly lies in the moment of leaping and being in the air, not in the instant of entering the water. Although entering the water is also within the scope of diving, its study is subtle. Therefore, the emphasis should be on "leaping" (躍) rather than "entering" (入). Regarding diving itself, it is essential for divers to strive for height in their jumps. Once they submerge into the water, the dive is complete. Diving is a specialized skill in swimming. However, our country's athletes have not shown widespread interest and training in it. Although there are many reasons for this, a significant one is that it is only listed as a demonstration event in the National Games. Therefore, it should be changed to a formal championship event in the future (please refer to my article "Points for Improvement in Organizing Sports Meets," published in the Diligent Sports Monthly, Volume 3, Issue 7). Furthermore, the Olympic diving events and rules should be adopted. This is the motivation for roughly translating this article.</p>
<p>The most significant difficulty at present is the lack of diving terminology. In this article, I have tried my best to use existing names for various dives, but many are newly created. There are bound to be many inappropriate aspects. I hope that fellow members of the sports community will correct them. The international diving rules and illustrations are detailed below.</p>
<p>General Rules</p>
<p>1.  All diving competitions organized in international sports events must follow the rules of the International Amateur Swimming Federation.</p>
<p>2.  The springboards, platforms, and all diving equipment must comply with the current rules.</p>
<p>3.  All diving equipment must be prepared at least eight days before the competition for the use of participating athletes.</p>
<p>4.  The order of divers must be determined by drawing lots.</p>
<p>5.  The drawing of lots must be conducted publicly. The time and location of the drawing must be stated in the competition notice.</p>
<p>6.  If necessary, athletes may be divided into groups. The number of athletes in each group shall be determined by the review committee. The results of all groups must be reviewed to determine the final ranking. The entire competition must be completed within one day.</p>
<p>7.  Before each dive, the chief judge must announce the athlete's name and the dive they intend to perform in advance.</p>
<p>8.  Athletes should be given sufficient time to prepare and execute their dives.</p>
<p>9.  Only dives listed in the table in these rules may be performed.</p>
<p>10. Each competition must include a certain number of required dives and optional dives.</p>
<p>11. Each athlete must complete the official form for their optional dives (either typed or handwritten), and submit a copy at least one week before the competition. The form must include:</p>
<p>(A) The category and number of the dive.</p>

<p>(C) The height of the springboard or platform.</p>
<p>(D) The degree of difficulty (difficulty).</p>
<p>12. Required dives must not be repeated in the optional dives. All dives with the same number are considered the same dive.</p>
<p>13. Athletes must sign the optional dive list. No changes may be made after the designated time. Each athlete is fully responsible for the accuracy of the information on the list.</p>
<p>14. Athletes who do not submit the list within the designated time will not be allowed to participate in the competition.</p>
<p>15. If the information on the list does not comply with the rules, the chief judge must decide before the competition whether to order corrections, make further adjustments, or refuse the athlete's participation.</p>
<p>16. All dives must be performed by the athlete themselves, without any assistance from others.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education and Culture Funding Increased by 500,000 Compared to Last Year</h3>

<h3>Fujian Province Reorganizing Higher Education - University Departments Defined to Avoid Duplication - Suspension of Government-Funded Overseas Study and Scholarships/Subsidies for Self-Funded Study</h3>
<p>(Xiamen Dispatch) The Fujian Provincial Government has decided to reorganize university education in the province starting from the autumn semester of the 25th year of the Republic (1936). Among the plans for reorganizing education in the province, the measures for reorganizing higher education involve reorganizing the colleges and departments established by various private universities and independent colleges. (A) Principles of Reorganization: To ensure that the departments established by each university and college are appropriate, without duplication or waste. To enable each university and college to focus on the development of a specific department, so that the level can be improved. To enable the establishment of important departments that have not yet been established. To enable each university and college to cooperate and form a comprehensive university. (B) Reorganization Measures: Xiamen University will establish three colleges: Arts, Sciences, Law, and Commerce. Each college will have the following departments: The College of Arts will have departments of Chinese Literature, History and Geography, and Education. The College of Sciences will have departments of Mathematics, Physics, Zoology, and Botany. The College of Law and Commerce will have departments of Commerce, Political Science, and Economics. Concord College will establish two departments: Arts and Sciences, with the following departments: The Arts department will have departments of Foreign Languages and Sociology. The Science department will have departments of Chemistry, Biology, and Physiology. Fujian College will be renamed Fujian Law College, the agriculture department will be abolished, and a law department will be established. The South China Women's College of Arts and Sciences will temporarily not divide into colleges, but will establish the following departments and specialized courses: The College of Arts and Sciences will have departments of Literature, Home Economics, and Music, as well as specialized courses in Physical Education, Home Economics, and Art. The Department of Education will convene a meeting of the presidents of various universities in July of this year to discuss how to implement the reorganization measures in phases, and to discuss matters of division of labor and cooperation at any time. The standards for the allocation of subsidies to private universities are as follows: (A) Xiamen University will receive a monthly subsidy of 4,500 yuan, specifically designated to subsidize the departments of Mathematics, Physics, and History and Geography. (B) Fujian College will receive a monthly subsidy of 1,000 yuan, with 60% designated for professors' salaries and 40% for purchasing books. The Provincial Government has also decided to suspend government-funded overseas study and scholarships/subsidies for self-funded overseas study starting from the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and to concentrate these funds on expanding and reorganizing education in the province.

<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Reform Universities</h3>
<p>(TASS, Moscow, June 24) The Council of People's Commissars and the Central Committee of the Communist Party have resolved to guide the reform of universities and specialized schools. The resolution, signed by Molotov and Stalin, has been published. The resolution states that the Stakhanovite movement has exposed the fact that the scientific education work of higher education institutions lags far behind its implementation. Therefore, it is necessary to revise curricula, textbooks, reference books, encyclopedias, and technical teaching materials to adapt them to the results of the Stakhanovite movement. Higher demands must be placed on higher education institutions to ensure that young people receive excellent training, political and general education, and can fully control the latest achievements in science, combining theory with practice and industrial experience with science.</p>
<p>The resolution stipulates that young people aged 17 to 35 who have completed full secondary education and passed the examination can enter higher education for free. The time for compulsory independent study courses under the guidance of professors will be reduced to increase students' independent research, and special libraries, laboratories, and science rooms will be established to facilitate independent research.</p>
<p>The resolution stipulates that technical specialized schools must hold meetings before the government examination committee. Industrial practice must occupy a fixed position in the entire curriculum. Students must engage in industrial practice in their special research departments. The best-equipped enterprises must provide opportunities for students of technical specialized schools to practice. The practice time in the last two years should account for more than 30%. The resolution stipulates a plan for improving the management of higher education, and a special clause forces supervisors to pay attention to students' physical fitness and health and guarantee them a good life.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Asks Schools to Pay Attention to Children's Health</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, in view of the fact that although primary schools pay great attention to children's mental training, there are still several points that contradict children's health and hygiene, which have a significant impact on children's development. Recently, it has been learned that primary schools encourage children to be diligent by ranking those who arrive at school first as an honor. While the intention is good, the method is not perfect. School-age children are full of competitive spirit, and often get up early before dawn, quickly eating breakfast, only to arrive first. After arriving at school, the time before class often reaches more than one hour. This reduces sleep time and wastes the early morning hours, which over time will significantly affect children's health. Therefore, a special order has been issued to the education bureaus of various counties to instruct schools to pay special attention and make corrections.</p>
<h3>Sino-Foreign Cultural Association Fares Farewell to Jiang Kanghu</h3>
<p>Dr. Jiang Kanghu has been invited by the Vancouver City Government of Canada to collect exhibits to participate in the Chinese Arts and Literature Exposition and is scheduled to set sail tomorrow on the Japanese Empress. The Sino-Foreign Cultural Association and the Cunwen Society held a tea party at the New Asia Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 6 PM to bid him farewell. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Participating Members: Including Chu Minyi, Xiong Xiling and his wife, Li Denghui, He Zhenya, Jiang Jianbai, Yang Zijing, Hu Huaichen, Gao Qianzi, Wang Juchuan, Xu Xiaotian, Li Ruihua, Wang Longzhang, Chen Dabei, and more than 20 foreign members and guests.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: First, Chairman Chu Minyi delivered a speech, briefly stating: Today, the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association and the Cunwen Society are bidding farewell to Mr. Jiang Kanghu, who is going to Canada. Mr. Jiang has decided to collect many literary and artistic exhibits to be exhibited in Canada, promoting Chinese culture. Although the government has not participated, Mr. Jiang's visit is equivalent to representing the government's participation because Mr. Jiang has stayed in Canada for a long time and is very familiar with the situation. He will definitely be of great help in the communication between Chinese and Canadian cultures. Gao Qianzi and others then delivered speeches.</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang's Report: Dr. Jiang Kanghu reported on the process, saying that this decision was made in response to the invitation of the Vancouver City Government of Canada and the local overseas Chinese to collect exhibits to participate in the exhibition. Because the time was short, there were not many achievements, but he personally went to various places in the north and south to collect them, and he received the support of the local government and the literary and art circles. He has also collected more than 60 boxes of exhibits, more than 3,500 pieces, including many valuable products such as calligraphy, paintings, porcelain, bronzes, lacquerware, and bamboo products. Chairman Han of Shandong presented 12 strips of glass silk screens, Song Zheyuan of Beiping presented 8 ancient embroidered brocade screens of the Eight Views of Jinjiang, and He Sui of Nanjing presented porcelain, all of which are valuable products. I am scheduled to take the Japanese Empress to Canada on the 27th, and I will also give lectures at the Japan-China Association in Tokyo and Honolulu. I am very grateful for your farewell today.</p>

<h3>Commercial Finance Was So-So</h3>
<p>This year's commercial sector, judging from its appearance, seems to have made progress, and some banks have jointly formed syndicates to provide loans to help rural areas and the silk and tea industries. However, it is still difficult to say what the actual situation is. As for commercial credit loans, they rely on actual strength these days. If a company's own ability is weak, it can't even take care of itself, how can it take care of others? Therefore, the situation of this year's semi-annual closing accounts is that 70-80% of the companies have no profit to speak of. For example, the closure of the Tongyi Trust Company was partly due to speculative failures, and partly due to years of losses and many bad debts at each closing, so the company could not operate smoothly. This kind of situation is worrying in every way. It is already fortunate not to lose money; wanting to make a profit is rare except for a few major banks. To say that the entire commercial sector is gradually showing signs of recovery is indeed what we hope for.</p>
<h3>Securities August Public Bonds Debuted Yesterday, Market Still Unable to Rally</h3>
<p>From Low to High: From High to Low: Quite Like a Parabola</p>
<p>Yesterday, the August futures of the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange debuted, coinciding with renewed serious rumors from the Hunan border. The August futures opened fully in the first session, with market prices mostly matching the recent "small three yuan" after deducting interest. However, there was still no profit to be made from arbitrage, and the market remained sluggish. The situation concerning the Hunan border troops was precarious, with talk of increasing stakes. Rumors in the north had not subsided, and under such circumstances, it was not easy for the market to rise.</p>
<p>Throughout yesterday morning, selling pressure was strong, with Nos. 5, 35, and 47 being sold, and Nos. 11 and 54 being bought. August futures also opened across the board, with prices falling uniformly by three jiao to half a yuan. In the second session, the shorts covered strongly, but mostly by scattered retail investors. The rebound was strong, with Type D stocks surging by seven and a half jiao, and others rising by four or five jiao. In the afternoon session, the initial trades continued to strengthen, with Type E and D stocks continuing to rise by one to four jiao. When Type C stocks were being traded, rumors suddenly arrived, and selling orders from Nos. 4, 10, and 47 flooded in, causing Type C to immediately fall by two and a half jiao, Type B by as much as seven jiao, and Type A by about three jiao. The trend was immediately hit. When prices were high, people sold off, and when prices were low, people bought in, so market prices fluctuated widely.</p>
<p>Whether the front-line battles will erupt or if there is still room for maneuver is the crucial key to current market prices. Observing the weak closing prices in the afternoon, it is expected that new lows may be seen in the future. The market results, excluding the initial opening of August futures, showed that Type D stocks still rose by one jiao, while the rest fell slightly by five fen to one or two jiao. The trend was from low to high, then from high to low, showing a complete inability to rally. The total transaction volume was 915 lots, totaling 5,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Weaving Cotton Yarn Feels Increasingly Loose</h3>
<p>Stability Due to Arbitrage This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend intensified. Due to the unfavorable environment and poor market sentiment, the situation this month was stable, but long-term sellers were active, and the market gradually trended downward. At the same time, spot yarn business was sluggish, and confidence weakened. The final trading price for this month was 201 yuan and 4 jiao, which was 6 yuan and 4 jiao higher than last month.</p>
<p>Long-Term Futures Fell by 1.5 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening of standard yarn futures was affected by the downward movement of overseas cotton and yarn, and market sentiment was weak, with a general downward trend. The trading floor was particularly loose, with a lack of buyers. As a result, the May contract fell by 50 fen to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. However, arbitrageurs were strong buyers of the current month contract, and it remained unchanged. In the afternoon session, the current month contract was strong due to short covering by Dafu, but long-term futures turned weak. In the second and third sessions, the lack of raw cotton and numerous market rumors led to even stronger selling pressure. As a result, all months fell by 70 to 90 fen compared to the morning closing price, with the current month falling by only 1 jiao. Sales included 1,000 bales of Jifeng, 2,450 bales of Yuda, 600 bales of Mingde, 1,250 bales of Gengfeng, 1,050 bales of Shenchang, 1,350 bales of Fengtai, 800 bales of Taichang, 1,550 bales of Yichang, 1,400 bales of Changfeng, 700 bales of Dafeng, and 900 bales of Yicheng. Purchases included 1,650 bales of Dafu, 600 bales of Juxing, 1,100 bales of Hexing, 1,450 bales of Shenji, 2,100 bales of Xiacheng, 1,200 bales of Shengyuan, 700 bales of Yongda, 850 bales of Xincheng, and 1,950 bales of Daji. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Yarn and Thread Prices All Fell</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales remained flat. Statistics showed that various guilds bought a total of 360 bales, with prices falling by 1 yuan and thread prices falling by 2 yuan. The purchase amounts by each guild are listed below.</p>
<h3>This Month's Cotton Plunged by 8 Jiao in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The American and Indian cotton markets, which had been rising for several days, turned downward, causing market sentiment to weaken. Most cotton merchants had already turned short, and the trading floor became increasingly loose. This month was the last day of trading, and the market felt quite soft. The final trading price suddenly fell to 45.5 yuan, still 3.5 yuan higher than last month.</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Selling Was Heavy</p>
<p>At the opening of cotton futures trading, the situation for the current month was stable due to the lack of sufficient delivery supplies, but the momentum turned downward as trading progressed to longer-term contracts. Sellers were eager, and all months fell by 20 to 30 fen. New cotton sales were even stronger due to favorable weather conditions, and all months fell by 5 fen to 3.5 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price in the concession, with the current month falling by 5 fen. In the afternoon session, the bulls were largely inactive, and the market softened, with prices falling in each session. The current month closed at 5.5 yuan, and the July contract also broke the 6 yuan mark. As a result, all months fell by 2.5 jiao to 3.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price, with the current month falling by 8 jiao. Sales included 1,500 dan of Tongfu, 2,700 dan of Yutian, 1,800 dan of Mingde, 3,100 dan of Gengfeng, 3,700 dan of Shenji, 3,500 dan of Dachangcheng, 2,200 dan of Yikang, 1,600 dan of Tonghe, 4,000 dan of Xinchang, 3,600 dan of Hexing, 2,200 dan of Xingchang, 3,200 dan of Changhe, 2,200 dan of Yuanyi, 3,300 dan of Yicheng, and 4,000 dan of Yuanxingchang. Purchases included 8,600 dan of Changfeng, 3,300 dan of Meiji, 1,700 dan of Zhenda, 5,300 dan of Runkang, 1,300 dan of Xiacheng, 1,100 dan of Xincheng, 1,100 dan of Yuanda, 8,000 dan of Gengfeng, and 1,500 dan of Shengyuan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Continue to Buy Cotton</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption remains strong, and Chinese factories continue to purchase actively. The source is 2,200 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<h3>American Cotton Weak, British and Indian Cotton Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened weak, with all months falling by two to six points. Although news from Liverpool was good, sales from the Far East, hedging by cotton farmers, profit-taking by bulls, and sell-offs by spot merchants caused the market to weaken. However, local guilds and mainland guilds continued to absorb cotton, with little trading volume. Later, warehouse merchants and Wall Street bought in, and prices improved. The July contract saw no improvement due to profit-taking by bulls, selling from the South, and offloading by spot merchants. The market closed stable, with spot prices falling by 12 points and futures prices falling by 12 to rising by 4 points. British spot cotton fell by 1 point and futures fell by 6-7 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters, but then fell back due to profit-taking by bulls. Bengal fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee, Oomra fell by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees, and Broach fell by 1.75 to 2.75 rupees. Original telegram on the left (dated 24th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the forecast for the Broach cotton for the April-May contract on the 25th was 213 rupees, down half a rupee from the previous day.</p>
<p>Three Grades of Yarn Fell, Cotton Flat</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 25th, three grades of yarn futures fell by 6 jiao to 2.3 yuan, with the near month at 205.1 yuan and the far month at 199.9 yuan. Cotton futures rose by 1 jiao to fell by 1.5 jiao, with the near month at 65.5 yuan and the far month at 61.35 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Market Conditions Return to Stability After Rising</h3>
<p>The cloth market was stimulated by the sharp rise in foreign cotton the week before, and the market was very good. The entire inventory of goods from various Chinese and foreign factories for this month was sold out, leading to thriving sales. Yesterday, as yarn and cotton prices softened and various firms had plenty of inventory, and Eastern goods were nearing the end of the month and needed to be cashed out, the market turned looser, by 2.5 to 5 fen per bolt. Japanese trading companies opened futures trading for July, with more than 400 bales of Yanghe Trumpet, Cranes, Blue Sun, and Blocked Fine Cloth being sold at prices that were 2.5 fen lower than the previous day. Most of these were bought by local dyeing factories. Chinese goods, due to their more moderate price increases, remained quite firm. Sales of Ewo coarse cloth opened yesterday, with 9-pound Cat Eagle, 5-Luck, and 11-pound Flying Bear and 9-Heavens rising by 5 fen. More than 100 bales were purchased by local and inland merchants. Actual sales remained brisk, with the most popular being plain white fine cloth and colored cloth from Sichuan Road for local dyeing factories. Bar cloths, satin damask, serge, crepe, fine cloth, and fine twill fabrics from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces continued to be actively traded. Merchants from Yunnan also purchased more than 200 pieces of fine twill, blue cloth, printed straight tribute cloth, and printed flannel.</p>
<h3>Foodstuffs Actual Sales Were Alright, Futures Trading of Flour Rebounded Strongly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the morning opening of the flour market, prices for all months presented an initial flat and then stable picture. Quotes for foreign wheat showed a slight improvement of 4 fen in Chicago and 1-2 jiao in Canada. However, due to lingering market volatility, opening prices were flat. After the second session, it was rumored that local factories were producing at double the volume as the new wheat season began, and spot flour, which had previously opened at 3.2 yuan or 1.5 jiao, could now be purchased through the exchange by adding only 1 jiao. Customers with actual sales needs naturally moved to purchase actively. Furthermore, due to the sharp decline the previous day without any rebound, opening prices were immediately good step by step. By the afternoon opening, trading was slightly lighter, but the market remained firm, rising an additional 1 fen compared to the morning. According to industry insiders, although this is the peak season for new wheat, sales in various markets will gradually expand, so future success or failure will depend on actual sales.</p>
<h3>Outside Investors Enter, Wheat Futures Rise by 1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market saw a strong rebound in all months in the morning opening. Although arrivals were heavy, customer demand for goods was not strong, and the strength of outside investors could not be underestimated. As a result, trading volume in all months was not high, but prices had already risen by 3-5 fen. By the afternoon opening, the current month saw only a slight increase due to the approaching delivery date, but the July contract and beyond saw brisk buying, and market prices rose steadily. This volatile situation was largely due to the unsettled times, which continued to fuel speculation. The July contract rebounded by as much as 1 jiao, and the rest rose by 8-9 fen. The spot wheat market saw strong arrivals and brisk sales. Prices for high-quality goods did not fluctuate, while prices for mid-grade goods rose by 3 fen. It was reported that Yao Bay wheat was 4.43 yuan, Mingguang Guandian Linzhun Guan wheat was 4.2 yuan, Jiangbei wheat was 4.15 yuan (second grade 1 jiao less), Gaoyou wheat was 4.16 yuan (second grade 1.3 jiao less), Wuhu wheat was 4.07 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 4.07-8 yuan, Nanjing wheat was 4.03 yuan, Hankou wheat was 3.97 yuan (second grade 9 jiao less), Weian wheat was 4.16-7 yuan, Shaoxing wheat was 4.13-4 yuan, Puzhen wheat was 4.07-8 yuan, Gaozi wheat was 4.07 yuan, Chongming wheat was 3.94 yuan, Kunshan wheat was 3.95-6 yuan, Changshu wheat was 4.085 yuan, and Mailai wheat was 3.9 yuan (second grade 8.7 fen less). Fuxin bought 12,000 bags, Fufeng bought 8,000 bags, and Shenda bought 2,000 bags.</p>
<p>American wheat prices are close to import parity, so hedging has increased. Forecasts predict changes in the weather in the Northwest, and drought news is gradually losing its impact. Rain will cause prices to plummet, and then gradually rise slowly.</p>
<h3>Peak Season for Fire Cakes, Soybean Cakes See Alarming Price Increases</h3>
<p>Violent Jump of 4-5 Fen in One Day</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market saw a sharp rise of 4-5 fen, mainly because the standard was controlled by Dalian, and inland sales markets saw activity in South China, so general sentiment was bullish. Purchasing from various villages rose, and prices in the market were once chaotic. Shangxiang Sipai cakes once opened at a low of 2.06 yuan, then gradually rose to 2.09 yuan. The trend strengthened further in the afternoon, with prices rising from 2.1 yuan, 2.11 yuan, and 2.12 yuan, before suddenly jumping to 2.14 yuan. Judging from the situation, the rising trend cannot be stopped for the time being. Statistics showed that 3,000 pieces of Shahe Guangbian cake were traded by ships, and 26,000-27,000 pieces of Sipai cake were traded by various factories.</p>
<h3>Standard Soybean Cakes Continue to Soar as Dalian Telegrams Show Multiple Price Increases in One Day</h3>
<p>Soybeans Up Over 1 Jiao... Cakes Good for 3-4 Fen</p>
<p>Both the standard soybean and soybean cake markets continued to soar yesterday. Soybeans saw strong demand from both spot sales and factory customers, and production prices were high, so market sentiment was particularly good. Actual soybean cake sales have also picked up, and with the fire cake season approaching, sentiment is naturally bullish. Furthermore, as raw materials are constrained, the market is gradually trending upward. Yesterday, the Dalian telegrams showed multiple price increases in one day, and buying sentiment became even stronger. Outside hoarders and speculators were also very active. As a result, prices were still fluctuating in the morning, but soybean futures suddenly rose by 1 jiao in the afternoon. The closing price for standard soybean futures surged by as much as 1.2 jiao. Standard cakes were flat in the morning, but also surged by 3-4 fen in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>White Rice Flat, Superior Du Rice Tight</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs arrived at numbers 24 and 25, with more than 5,000 stones of goods. Street sales were worse than before, with only the Dalian gang handling 700-800 bags. As a result, the market showed signs of softening. South Port early rice recovered slightly, and so did thin rice. Only Su Tong indica, which had been arriving sparsely in recent days, could still be supported. Du Yangjian was quite firm due to customer demand, and the situation was tight. Yin Bian Yuan had no movement.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various riversides at Ha Xia were at numbers 15 and 16, with few ships, about 70-80. Sales of various goods on the market remained flat. White indica initially called tight by nearly one jiao in the morning, but stabilized in the afternoon. Thin rice prices increased by one jiao. Yin Yuan stabilized. Bai Yuan tightened by several fen to one jiao. Du Jian prices increased by more than one jiao, and customer-demanded goods sold actively, with the market tightening by another jiao or so. Prices for all other goods were firm.</p>
<h3>Seafood Sea Cucumber Sales Sluggish, Market Prices Turning Downward</h3>
<p>Sources of sea cucumber from the East and West Oceans are still scarce, and inventories on the streets are also very thin.

The spot price for B-brand white silk at 78 degrees and 20.22 thread count was sold for 1.635 yuan yesterday morning, an increase of 1 fen. Futures rose by half a fen to 1.58 yuan. Yokohama silk prices were firm, with spot and futures prices rising by 5-7 yuan. Lyon silk prices remained unchanged, so the Shanghai silk market saw only slight activity.

<h3>Qihua Sold As Soon As It Arrived</h3>
<p>Zhenmei Green Tea Slightly Quiet</p>
<p>Qimen fragrant black tea has been very popular in the market in the last two days. British trading companies such as Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, Tianyu, and Jinlong have all had large sales. Russian companies are also planning to actively purchase. Goods are being sold as soon as they arrive, and the market is excellent. Market prices have risen by 2-3 yuan compared to before and are expected to continue to rise. The black tea market has also remained unchanged, but medium-grade goods have been slightly sluggish. Yesterday, there were few transactions in Tunzhen, with only Xiehe and Tongfu purchasing slightly for core-extracted Zhenmei, priced from 22 yuan to 130 yuan. Huizhou Zhenmei Baolong continued to purchase several hundred boxes, priced from 70 yuan to 73-74 yuan. Suizhen Yihe and Baolong purchased a total of 300 boxes, all priced at 74 yuan, an increase of 2-3 yuan compared to before. Ping Shui pearl tea transactions have been quiet recently. Yesterday, only Yihe purchased about 300 boxes, and Hua Tea purchased more than 100 boxes, priced at 54-55 yuan. Total sales of red and green tea in the city were more than 8,600 boxes.</p>

<h3>Old Notes from the Mountains</h3>
<p>— Before Coming to Shanghai, Autumn 1935 —</p>
<p>Rosa! Your letter has stirred up the waves in my heart again. How can the tranquility of the mountains calm my heart?</p>
<p>"Being nurtured by nature cannot alleviate your illness. It will only deepen it!" R, this is your warning to me, and you know how touched I am by these words!</p>
<p>If I had come into contact with ph.'s works earlier, I would have mustered the courage to rush to Shanghai regardless, to plunge into the torrent of life. If I had seen [your letter] before coming here, I would have left this "high mountain" - why are you so playful? - to live in your "small room." But I have already come here to "avoid the autumn" - now is the time when those idle and wealthy city dwellers who came here to escape the summer are descending the mountain. My coming here has only made me feel the ancient city's "autumn wind, autumn rain, so deadly," so I am temporarily avoiding it in the mountains. And yesterday, I already took seven chapters out of the ten yuan note in my pocket and offered them to the old lady who guards the villa for her son-in-law with the girl. She is a devout Christian who prays to God and drinks holy water every day. Even if I "feel the autumn is endless," I can only endure this "long, lonely autumn night with the autumn lamp" and bury my head in the pile of books I brought to explore the ultimate questions of the universe and life to pass the month. I would rather be confined in a decadent life than engage in low-level pleasures and have my soul dominated by a philosophical executioner like Hong; I can no longer choose another path. So I fled to these mountains and forests to purge the toxins and dispel the bitterness hidden deep within my heart. I have never failed to consider that my lonely heart will become even lonelier as a result. But although it is lonely here, I can still breathe some fresh air. If I stay long in the atmosphere of powder and anesthetics, the little bit of fresh air that remains in me will also be contaminated!</p>
<p>R! When a person cannot actively resist fate, fate will not allow you to choose. If you lack the power of self-control, fate will completely control you.</p>
<p>Am I not already being subjugated by a dominant force and merely struggling weakly? A sad struggle! A despicable struggle! We cannot grow new strength within ourselves, can we? Can we? Where is the storm? Where is the lightning? Where is the sun?</p>
<p>When I realized that I was a voice shouting in the wilderness, I collapsed to the ground. I hope someone will call out: "Fallen comrade, get up..."</p>
<p>You are that person.</p>
<p>We must seize the power of rebirth!</p>
<p>Have you received Ali's letter yet? There is no need to be happy or sad. It is enough to be able to get up after falling. If the Ali of the past is dead, may it be resurrected now or in the near future!</p>
<p>Sinking is too terrible: whether it is sinking in the gutter, in pink dreams, or in pale muteness, it is terrible.</p>
<p>ph. says he is "standing on the edge," dependent on gravity. Stand on the edge, follow forward, forward! Even if it does not become a driving force.</p>
<p>A person who lives alone often likes to meditate. The more I meditate, the more I fall into the trap of metaphysics, and I will not be able to climb out of it.</p>
<p>Let's talk about our real lives. I have decided to stay here for a month. Please allow me to spend a month leisurely here. I am very willing to live with you, and I also love your loving mother and乖乖 little baby. I plan to move to your place after the end of this month if Shanghai is not an option. -- If Shanghai can't even find food for myself, the cultural fruit market can't fill my stomach either. -- Before I came here, I originally intended to go to your place, but my weak brain, now considers everything more, so I tore up a letter asking you to find a house and wrote that letter inviting you to the city to see Paulette Goddard's "Modern Times". You are busy teaching and cannot find the time. I had no way to wait for you to meet and discuss. After arguing with that dogmatic person -- wasn't I just throwing a few bombs? -- I couldn't bear to be that scholar's guest anymore, so I hurriedly left that devil's den and came to these mountains and fields. Your place is a personal space, and I am afraid it is not suitable for me to live there, and I am afraid it will hinder you. So I decided to come and meet the great loneliness here.</p>
<p>I have been here for five days, but the house was only settled yesterday. For the first three days, I lived a simple life: at night, I slept under the stars on a bed in the small pavilion in the courtyard surrounded by vines and trees, with insects singing me lullabies. In the morning, I went to the outdoor stream to wash with ice-cold spring water, and then I climbed mountains and visited temples... Renting a house here is too expensive, and eating is also expensive. This is not a place for an unemployed vagrant like me to live, but since I've come, I'll make the best of it. Today, I bought a week's worth of food and prepared to cook for myself. There is almost nothing left in my bag.</p>
<p>Besides borrowing a box of books here, I brought two hundred sheets of manuscript paper. I must write down something that I can write now. That's why I'm not afraid of being lonely here. In solitude, I hope this pen is my companion, my lover.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Bless your mother and your child, thank them for thinking of me, kiss them for me. Don't overwork yourself, and I hope you are happy! If you can find the time, come and see your lonely friend.</p>
<h3>Cousins</h3>
<p>— Ms. Cao Ming</p>
<p>The reply that Liang Yonghong, the chief clerk of Lixing Silver Firm, gave to my seventh elder brother was as follows:</p>
<p>"...I am very pleased to learn of your grand ambition to go abroad (the intention of going to a foreign country), and you will surely have a bright future from now on. However, regarding the matter of lending money as you requested, due to the recent shortage of funds, it is impossible to raise the money to meet your needs. How about we consider it again after the New Year?..."</p>
<p>My seventh elder brother and Liang Yonghong were very close friends when they studied in the village private school. Later, they separated, but their friendship was still maintained considerably in their letters.</p>
<p>My seventh elder brother handed me the letter belatedly, his arm around the back of his head, his eyes reflecting a layer of blank light. He didn't say a word, pacing back and forth in my small house, often almost touching the wall with his chest before waking up and turning around.</p>
<p>He was already a twenty-four-year-old man, with savage muscles all over his body. His long figure seemed even more inappropriate in this small house, as if he might knock over some bulky furniture at any moment. I called out to him, comforted him, but he didn't hear me, as if someone had hit him on the head, causing him to fall into a state of near faintness.</p>
<p>"Don't be so foolishly trusting of that slippery fellow," he said to me sadly after a long time. "Didn't I make it clear in my letter to him that it wouldn't work after this month? If I go after the New Year, it will be the off-season. What will I do then? And how will I get by for these next few months?..."</p>
<p>The large eyes and wide mouth on his long face often made an unspoken expression of preparing to swallow some pain. He liked to do this when he was being cruelly manipulated.</p>
<p>Soon, he left my small house. After that, every time he wrote to me, I saw an unhappy face, as if he was planning something all day long. He was no longer as excited and earnest as before, telling me about his "ideal factory" that didn't have a Number One (boss) and allocated two-thirds of the profits to wages. He said that he would dedicate his life to this innocent and interesting ideal that was almost like a child's.</p>
<p>In the countryside, he was originally a well-known headstrong and adventurous child. Since he apprenticed for four years in a foreign-managed machine factory in Hung Hom, Hong Kong, his temperament strangely became stubborn and melancholic. He was almost unwilling to express his true intentions with straightforward words. His master (our cousin), a thin man in his late thirties, once criticized my seventh elder brother like this:</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if he argues with me, or even hits me. How could I hate a cousin who hasn't come of age? But you must know that those No. 1s treat us like machines. If the workers cause them a little bit of obstruction, they have to 'repair' them!" His attitude in speaking was as steady and slow as his way of life. Experience drove his wisdom into a dark corner. He was overly cautious and worried about everything, which was completely opposite to my seventh elder brother.</p>
<p>"Seventh elder brother's unemployment proves that what I said was right... Now, it's time for him to have good luck. It's much easier to make money in Siam's industry than here—"</p>
<p>Regarding my seventh elder brother's unemployment, he and his master had an argument. The master said that the main reason he was fired was because his temper conflicted with the power of that No. 1. But the young man stubbornly said that it was simply because business was slow, and they didn't need so many people.</p>
<p>My seventh elder brother often arrogantly said that his master was a useless person.</p>
<p>"If there's a disaster, he'll definitely be in the last group to escape..." he said.</p>
<p>"This kind of person isn't a bad person. He can do very good things when something happens, because he doesn't intend to harm others!" I defended our cousin. The plan to go to Siam was realized in early November of the lunar calendar.</p>
<p>His demeanor when he left Guangzhou was just like a child preparing to do something fun. His blood vessels jumped under his skin to show his joy and vigor. His movements couldn't be as calm as usual, his hands and feet showing excessive excitement, and his voice was louder and more unrestrained than usual. To show his composure, he deliberately pretended to be calm, comforting me as if nothing was happening:</p>
<p>"After I get there, as soon as I get my wages, I'll send some back to you right away. You can support yourself now, but I'm worried about your health. Don't work yourself to death. It's good to take a few days off each month...."</p>
<p>Regarding my seventh elder brother's travel expenses to Siam, his master only explained it to me after he left China. Their strategy was as follows:</p>
<p>Not long after receiving the letter from Liang Yonghong, the chief clerk of Lixing, my seventh elder brother cancelled the idea of going to Nanyang in front of him. About half a month later, he took his master—who was then acting as a more considerate petty bureaucrat—to Liang Yonghong and said in a very certain tone that they had contacted the Anti-Smoking Bureau for a speculative business that could earn double the profit in the first month, requiring 500 yuan of capital, and they were now just short of one-third of the capital... In this way, Liang Yonghong bravely admitted to this deficiency.</p>
<p>"Seventh brother's words are right," the small man said to me slowly. He squatted on the bed, holding his knees with both hands, his fleshy nosetrils breathing unhappily, his expression as if in great pain. "Cheating? He doesn't admit that this behavior is cheating. He doesn't believe my borrowing contract, but he believes my lies. What can I do? But I believe that at most in half a year or a year, our friendship can be restored. Ah, that young man! He's as brave as a bear. I've never seen anyone so sure of everything he thinks." He paused to focus his mind a little more. "Maybe you all think I'm very ignorant and stupid? Actually, I know everything. His personality, his desires, but I am his master. In the factory, I can't let him cause trouble!... Now it's good. Let him run alone to a strange country to create his own world! Before he left, I told him many things, but he answered me with an easy smile. Let him go. How can a young man know the taste of life without banging his head bloody!..."</p>
<p>The day after my seventh elder brother left, the steady and melancholy skilled worker—my cousin—quietly returned to the Hung Hom factory alone.</p>
<p>The first letter my seventh elder brother gave me said that the first thing that surprised him after arriving in Siam was that the industry there was a hundred times more depressed than in Hong Kong. Even jobs lower than three dimes a day were impossible to find, and he, along with thousands and tens of thousands of people, stretched their necks outside the factory gates. He said that he was afraid he would have to change careers, and solemnly declared: "I will never return to my homeland if I don't make it in this lifetime—" He also said that if he couldn't find a job, he wouldn't even want to write to us.</p>
<p>This continued for three years, and I didn't receive his second letter. (Although he later accepted our cousin's advice and the travel expenses he sent, and returned in ragged clothes.) Now, when I think of his not writing, I also inexplicably resent him.</p>
<h3>The Smiling Death</h3>
<p>— Zhou Muzhai</p>
<p>Death is an irreversible tragedy for the person involved. Even cowardly suicide or passionate martyrdom is the same for others, except for hateful intention or indifferent unintentionality. Especially death that embraces a certain belief and carries a certain mission, towards the death of those who are the same or sympathetic. The irreversible foundation hides the hidden pain of unfulfilled heart and strength. "Exhausting oneself to the task, dying only after completion," is actually still a last resort. For the person involved, a concrete example is a will. For others, a concrete explanation is like "He died before achieving success, which made heroes' tears fill their lapsels."</p>
<p>However, Gorky's death can be said to be an exception, a smiling death.</p>
<p>Seeing victory, seeing the path to success, having full bodies, having those who follow in his footsteps, and it being so widespread, even in death, one can rest in peace.</p>
<p>But this is limited to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>And for the Soviet Union, it is still a loss, an irreversible tragedy. Not to mention other countries.</p>
<h3>A Spring</h3>
<p>— Jiangdong</p>
<p>Is it autumn or winter.</p>
<p>The early morning is still like a desolate night,</p>
<p>Piles of fallen leaves in the woods are like graves,</p>
<p>The buried insects still have their last breath.</p>
<p>Is it winter or spring.</p>
<p>Rain-like mist and mist-like rain seal everything.</p>
<p>Lost birds hide under the eaves, looking at people in panic,</p>
<p>Unable to bear it after all, a group flew away with flapping sounds.</p>

<p>I have two acquaintances who both love to play with photography. The ways these two people play are simply different. One is extremely fond of taking pictures of himself. Eight or nine out of ten of the photos he takes have himself in them. The other tries to avoid taking pictures of himself. He doesn't even have a self-timer. The photos that have him in them are all taken by others. When these two people meet, they often provide many reasons to defend their own quirks. However, quirks are mostly not consciously developed, so those defensive reasons are often just made up on the spot. Naturally, there may be a very valuable reason to explore here. And those who recognize photography as an art will immediately pull in some art theory to solve it. However, no sufficient reason can probably make either of these two people change his quirk. He naturally doesn't dislike his photos becoming works of art, but he won't do it if he has to sacrifice his quirk as the price. Anyway, it is generally permissible not to regard photography as art but as entertainment, so just continue playing as before.</p>
<p>Photos can be taken only for oneself to see, without any relationship with others, so treating photography as entertainment will not cause people's criticism. Or those who strive to win the artistic status of photography may feel that if everyone takes photos with this entertaining attitude, it will hinder the becoming of art in photography. But the results obtained by those who take photos for art may even be the same as those who take photos for business. Businessmen have various techniques to seek business satisfaction, but their works are often not as beautiful as the amateur's or some of the amateur's achievements that photographers love. Because of this, photography merchants now can only take half-length photos and enlarge them as their business. Art photographers, if they take care of art conditions everywhere, may not end up being used for nothing other than providing information for experts to brag to each other. In the future, if there are immortal photographic masterpieces, many may still come from the hands of players. Naturally, at that time, the players will not be able to maintain the name of players, but will have to be crowned with the title of artist.</p>
<p>Expecting too much from the achievements of playing will certainly greatly anger the proper artists. But fortunately, it is about photography. No matter how much you turn it around and scold the attitude of playing, even if the bad photos are bad, they will not become harmful. We certainly don't have to borrow the words that games are the original spirit of art to praise playing, but playing can never be falsely accused of having improper purposes. As long as playing is as serious as a child's play, then the meaning of playing is also quite serious. Being able to admit this considerable seriousness, within the limits of photography and machinery, is certainly not too far off. Unfortunately, other arts do not have such a clever mechanism to make basic decisions, so they are very different. When a sect forms a force and occupies orthodoxy, it will inevitably create many unjust cases, and wait for later art historians to redress them. The art historians of each era are almost just working on redressing unjust cases. But we know that no matter how far the redress goes, the orthodox faction will always become the object of research first, so there is never a lack of artists who strive for orthodoxy in each era. The problem of taking or not taking oneself in photos, if placed in other arts, may become the center of debate of an era. The question of whether or not to add figures in Chinese landscape painting is very close to this. It is true that a figure in landscape painting is often enough to affect the spirit of the whole painting, and the realistic nature in photography will never be changed by the addition or subtraction of a figure. This is very sufficient as the reason for a problem or not a problem, but the problem can always be dragged into the scope of not a problem. At this point, I hope that photography will not become an art again.</p>
<p>As I said, I have two acquaintances who love to play with photography. I myself have not even thought about learning this skill. This must be stated, on the one hand, to prevent kind-hearted people from worrying that I will fall into how much depravity because of stubbornly playing. If you ask me whether I am afraid of harming others even though I will not be harmed, I am not afraid. I think that those who play with photography will not change their quirks because of the theories of artists, then the above statement will naturally not cause the wavering of the artistic faction. And those who play already have their quirks as their basic reason, then the existence or non-existence of the above statement has nothing to do with it. Then why bother to say this set of empty words? Here, you can pull playing to weave charges. Usually, people like to talk about things that they don't understand very well. And photography is often unavoidable to have a relationship with us. We have a great opportunity to encounter a player photographer and an artistic photographer. And they want us to become the object of playing or the object of art. Since we, this object, are human, we are naturally unavoidable to have a reflection effect. We cannot, like the people when Western learning first came, refuse to take photos for fear of taking away our vital spirit, nor can we accept the new superstition that taking photos can remove bad luck and welcome photography. For photographers who are just playing, I can only reply with a no if I don't like to play. If I like to, I can let him play with taking pictures of cats and dogs, just like being called a horse or a cow, it doesn't matter. For artistic photographers, it can't be so simple. Maybe he intends to qualify me as a model. Since this qualification cannot be denied after it is expressed, nor can it be declared without consent. The author can usually not be responsible for the object, but the object cannot get rid of the author's involvement. If we have seen a certain type of photo title in some books and newspapers and feel chilling, we cannot help but feel a little cramped for artistic photographers.</p>
<p>Being a model for a rare and great artist is often an extraordinary honor. Shaw asked Rodin to sculpt his own statue, and Herlis called him very smart, knowing that his own achievements were not enough to be passed down permanently, and could also be immortalized by Rodin. Duncan was also very happy when he learned that Rodin intended to create a statue for him, and deeply regretted that it would not have the opportunity to be realized. In addition, I don't know how many ordinary people hope to be selected as a model by Rodin, or only hope for an artist who is next to Rodin, or even may become Rodin in case. But the farther away from Rodin the artist is, I am afraid that he thinks that he is very much like Rodin, and regards giving people statues as giving people a great honor. This kind of honor is really unbearable to accept. Unfortunately, honor has turned into irony, or my face is born badly. Kestona defended Goethe that Albert was written too badly. Although he was generally recognized as ignorant, he was actually very smart. Since he knew that the fact that Albert was its shadow would inevitably be explored, then that defense was indeed necessary. The ugliness written under the pen of a writer is recognized as the scars of others. Not much has become an indisputable theory. Why must the photos taken be "the correct body without error"? However, among the artists of photography, there is actually a faction that does not seek likeness, but only seeks spirit. This spirit is also the spirit of that "vital spirit"! In this way, in addition to hiding my ghost face from photography, I just hope that photography will not become an art again.</p>
<h3>Night Market</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>This is Xidan Avenue in Beiping. Although Beiping is an ancient city, Xidan Avenue seems to have been put on an imported jacket and is slightly different from the original streets. If you really want to explore the ancient color of Beiping, you must first go to the dusty small alleys to find it. Xidan Avenue has obviously absorbed civilization from outside China. The streets here are also paved with asphalt, with tram tracks on them. Some of the storefront decorations are three-dimensional. After night falls, neon lights emit dazzling red and blue colors. Sales and large discounts on all goods are advertised everywhere. Cars come and go non-stop. This is the street of a modern city.</p>
<p>Xidan Avenue is bustling because there is a shopping mall here. In addition to the rows of shops, there are also cinemas, acrobatics arenas, drum-singing theaters and other entertainment places, which are very easy to attract tourists' footsteps. In the evening, although the acrobatics arena is closed, it is more lively than during the day. From the shopping mall along the east side of the street all the way to the Xidan Archway, stalls are set up one after another. This is the so-called "night market" - originally more lively than during the day. Pedestrians squeeze among the stalls, some strolling, some picking out goods they want to buy.</p>
<p>Recently, many bargains have been added to the night market, like what Fuji silk and XX yarn. They are piled high in front of the stalls, the color is good, and the price is cheap. One dime and a few cents to buy one foot, so cheap! Buying one foot of free cloth costs more than twenty cents. Naturally, everyone likes to buy cheap things. Without the stall owners shouting loudly to sell, customers are already filling the stalls and unable to cope with them all.</p>
<p>There are also some electroplated scissors, forks, spoons and other daily necessities, which are several times cheaper than local handicrafts. Since the things are exquisite and very convenient to use, only a fool would not like to buy them. As for myself, because I couldn't resist the temptation of the cheap price, I also bought a small foreign knife. This knife can cut paper and peel fruit skin, and it is shiny and bright, costing only twenty cents. It's not that I'm an amateur. Insiders can buy it for only eight cents. This kind of thing in Shanghai costs at least fifty or sixty cents at the most ordinary. In short, because this is smuggled goods, it is so cheap.</p>
<p>Selling sour plum soup is a new business that has been launched since the summer. Two cups cost one big coin. People shout loudly to attract customers. Rickshaw pullers, with sweat all over their bodies and faces, stop the rickshaw and throw one or two big coins to quench their thirst and relieve the heat. Sometimes they think it's not cold enough and add a little bit of shaved ice. Children's footprints often remain in this area, watching other people's good fortune and swallowing saliva into their throats.</p>
<p>The fruit stall business is not very good. The bananas are rotten and black, and there is no customer in sight. Apricots are divided into piles, all with piles of five big coins and piles of ten big coins. The cherries are already rotten, and there are not many customers buying one or two pounds of the yellow pears that are black and rotten.</p>
<p>It is the time when zongzi are on the market. The business of this food is not bad, and it is also iced in piles of ice, cool and delicious, which can greatly relieve the heat. One by one is sold out, and strings and strings are sold out. The owner's face is full of joy, and he carefully collects the remaining bamboo leaves, preparing to wrap them again tomorrow.</p>
<p>Selling fresh flowers and pancakes has no business, just like the newly baked sesame cakes are rarely patronized, and it is easy to not keep the feet of passersby.</p>
<p>The most meaningful thing is the small book stall. Some books are very old and are arranged there in a mess. Most of them are chapter novels of the Mandarin Duck Butterfly School, such as love and awakening the world, but occasionally you can find one or two rare or banned books, and you get it as if you have found a treasure, but the stall owner sells it at a great bargain without realizing it. Sometimes, you can spend eight big coins to buy a Western book worth 95 cents in US dollars.</p>
<p>The straw hat stalls and sock stalls have some customers, and seasonal goods always have a small road. Some customers also visit the fan sellers.</p>
<p>The most annoying thing is the rickshaw pullers. As soon as they see you get off the sidewalk, they scramble to solicit business: "Take a rickshaw? I'll take you. Where are you going?" Even if you shake your head, they will keep pestering you and blocking your way. As long as you say the place, they will swarm up and ask for the price. "One dime - forty coins - thirty coins - twenty-eight coins -" They ask for their own price and then lower it themselves. They will even pull a twelve-coin business, which is less than three cents in big money, but the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai will not pull a nine-copper-coin business.</p>
<p>Cars and trams are running, the noisy waves of sound, and the tide of people are surging in the night market until midnight, when the running of cars, the movement of people, and the transaction of goods can stop.</p>
<h3>Bud</h3>
<p>— Hua Rui</p>
<p>This ripe bud has blossomed,</p>
<p>Tomorrow morning, it will absorb the moist dewdrops,</p>
<p>And greet the beautiful sun with a smile.</p>
<p>Although the storm has struck,</p>
<p>And the ruthless wasteland,</p>
<p>Has buried the fallen petals,</p>
<p>Yet, this bud has finally bloomed again.</p>

<h3>Wuxi Monks to Receive First Aid Training</h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>This is according to yesterday's newspaper report: The Wuxi County authorities, in order to enable all Buddhist believers in the county to cope with emergencies, plan to hold a first aid training class for monks, and have ordered the Buddhist Pure Land Society to prepare for its organization. Yesterday, the society specially convened a meeting of abbots from temples throughout the county, attended by several people, to discuss and pass the outline for first aid training for monks. All monks between the ages of eighteen and forty must receive first aid training. The training period is tentatively set at three months, and the training physicians will be provided by doctors from various hospitals in the urban area. Once preparations are complete, training can begin, it is said.</p>
<p>This is perhaps a somewhat satisfactory matter. Buddhism has deep-rooted historical origins within Chinese society. Historically, those who "leave home" to become monks or nuns, going up mountains and into forests, originally did so to "see through the red dust" and view everything as "emptiness." They inherently possess compassionate hearts and wish to deliver all beings. However, since they have retreated into mountains and forests and entered temples, they only wish to cultivate "purity" and enter "heaven" to become gods or immortals. Why should they care about worldly affairs and the masses of people? Just like scholar-officials who spend their days sitting in "bitter rain studios," drinking bitter tea, and talking about foxes and ghosts, paying no attention to the "universe" and "flies." However, although they possess a superhuman "spirituality," they ultimately still have a physical body. And this body, just like ordinary people, ultimately cannot transcend the natural environment and the collective of humanity—society.</p>
<p>Originally, who would dare deny that they are just like ordinary "people," representing a certain stratum of human society. Therefore, today, as the national crisis becomes more pressing day by day and the lives of the masses become more urgent day by day, the critical moment of life and death clearly indicates to us that it is either resistance for survival or extinction! Therefore, on the front lines of national unity against the enemy for national salvation, regardless of whether one is a farmer, worker, merchant, student, soldier, or even a monk or nun... as long as they are people who do not want to be slaves of a fallen nation, they must shoulder their sacred responsibility for national salvation. Therefore, today, the Wuxi authorities' preparation to organize monks and provide them with first aid training for emergencies is also one of the noteworthy tasks in today's preparations for resisting the enemy and saving the nation.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? According to reports in various newspapers on the 10th of this month, the Buddhist Association of China published statistics on temples and monks/nuns nationwide: There are more than 267,000 temples and nunneries of all sizes nationwide, with more than 738,000 monks and nuns. And provinces such as Sichuan, Henan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hunan are not yet included. Here, we will not discuss their religious stance and beliefs, or their relationship with today's society. However, in today's situation of life and death, if these hundreds of thousands of "transcendent" masses could also shoulder the responsibilities of an emergency, just like the monks of Wuxi, wouldn't they be a supporting force on our front lines of resisting the enemy! "Contribute one's strength and fulfill one's responsibility," this is the indispensable faith and responsibility of people in times of emergency, striving for national independence and sacrificing for the freedom of the masses! Arise, those who do not want to be slaves!</p>
<h3>Cold Water Bath (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>In the countryside, the time for taking a cold water bath is also the time for busily picking cotton. When I parted the reeds to enter the water, I was often seen by my parents. What made me especially afraid was my mother, who would hold a hoe with a stern face, threatening to knock me down. So I had no choice but to obey her and climb ashore. After many such incidents, I finally learned to take cold water baths. I could not only swim, but also "submerge my head," (diving with my head underwater and swimming), which brought me unparalleled joy and also gave me a way to deal with my mother. For example, when my mother held a hoe to hit me, I would quickly submerge my whole body underwater, and after a while, I would emerge far away in another place. When my mother came chasing again, I would submerge my whole body underwater again, and after a while, I would emerge far away in another place. In this way, although my mother's face carried anger, she couldn't help but laugh out of joy in her heart. So I laughed too, admiring my own skills. Later, my mother felt that there would be no danger, so she stopped bothering me.</p>
<p>In the summer, from when the cicadas first started singing until their voices disappeared, I spent almost the whole day immersed in the water. The joy of propelling my body forward in the water with both hands was hard to describe. After eating dinner, sitting in the courtyard without any breeze, staring blankly at the moon overhead, with mosquitoes swarming around and beads of sweat seeping out of my skin, I would quietly invite my companions to immerse ourselves in the water. Breaking through the moon in the water formed shimmering, uncertain silver chains. When our feet moved, waves splashed everywhere, illuminated by the moon, and the waves also turned silver. Standing in the water, watching the surface gradually calm down, the moon also hid steadily at the bottom of the water. Tilting my head slightly, the shadow of my head was clearly imprinted on the water. Swimmers in the city would never know these kinds of pleasures, only wild children in the countryside could enjoy them. In the city, only those with money can enter the swimming pool, while in the countryside, a cold water bath in the river ditch only requires a body, and a little skill that anyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>Every day, in the wide ditch in front of the school gate, seeing many wild children taking cold water baths, I often think of my childhood. Now this kind of life is far away from me, and seeing these younger children only brings a slight sense of sadness. Summer has arrived, and I happen to be in the countryside again, I must take a cold water bath, I want to relive my old dream...</p>

<h3>"Bloody Wedding" Performance</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Tension and Excitement</p>
<p>Detective films have recently risen like a tide and are invincible. However, if there is a film that can appear on the silver screen with a brand new posture, an extraordinary theme, and unprecedented intensity, it is undoubtedly the latest authoritative production "Bloody Wedding" by Yi Hua Company. The production of this film required painstaking effort and was a glorious price obtained by all the actors from injuries, bloodshed, and great sacrifices. The film features two armored military vehicles, a large machine gun vehicle, four hundred rifles, twenty revolvers, and eight box cannons, consuming a total of 15,000 bullets, truly the most unprecedented and magnificent. Moreover, the mechanisms are layered? There are mysterious dilapidated temples, terrifying coffins, automatic walls, etc., all of which are novel and mysterious. Several intense battles are chilling and heart-pounding. The cast includes Wang Yin, Zheng Mengxia, Wang Naidong, Wang Cilong, Wei Heling, Guan Hongda, and dozens of others. Ms. Zheng Mengxia plays a female spy in the play, who is searched by detectives, threatened by bandits, and forcibly occupied by men. A weak woman, besieged on three sides, reaches the extreme of inner pain. In short, this film is truly a masterpiece that cannot be missed in the domestic silver screen. And Wang Juelong's directing skills have also surpassed his previous works. The film is scheduled to be released at the Jincheng Grand Theater starting Saturday.</p>

<h3>Tian Han Joins Xinhua Company</h3>
<p>Tian Han is a veteran figure with extremely high qualifications in the Chinese film industry, but for many years he has been engaged in drama and has not been involved in film. It wasn't until the rise of Lianhua Company that he began to compile film scripts again, such as "Three Modern Women" and "The Light of Motherhood," which were highly praised. Later, he also served in the newly established Yihua Company. Recently, apart from remotely leading the scriptwriting for one or two companies, there has been no closer involvement in the film industry. Suddenly, news came that Xinhua Film Company, due to the increasing intensity of its work and the completeness of its various talent groups, was only lacking complete scripts as a backup. They immediately set their sights on our old friend Tian, inviting him to serve as the director of scriptwriting. After several discussions, Mr. Tian was very happy to accept. From now on, Mr. Tian has already started his duties as the director of scriptwriting. He also said, "If I don't do it, then I won't; if I do it, then I have to take responsibility."</p>
<h3>Tianmu Mountain Waterfall on Camera</h3>
<p>A Fairyland in "Peach Blossom Dream"</p>
<p>The location for the outdoor scenes of "Peach Blossom Dream" is Tianmu Mountain, more than a hundred miles away from Hangzhou. This place is very secluded and there are no hotels. The large team of seventy or eighty people from Xinhua Company all live in temples on the mountain peaks. Tianmu Mountain is very high, so they are usually rolling in the clouds, feeling as if they are in the clouds on both sides. As for why they went all the way to Tianmu Mountain at any cost to shoot outdoor scenes? It is said that the great waterfall of Tianmu Mountain is truly spectacular. "Peach Blossom Dream" has several scenes that require filming many young girls playing in the water under the waterfall. Sixty or seventy girls, all bare-chested and showing their legs, each showing their swimming skills. This kind of mysterious and beautiful picture structure cannot be filmed without a good outdoor location. Therefore, the owner of Xinhua resolutely decided to send the outdoor shooting team to Tianmu Mountain at the cost of huge travel expenses and stayed there for twenty-three days. Because this place is surprisingly high and rarely sees the sun, the twenty-three days of delay actually only amounted to seven days of work. However, the results were truly excellent. After they arrived in Shanghai, they hurriedly screened the filmed footage, and everyone who saw it praised it, simply looking like a fairyland. This is truly the case that you only see results if you put in a lot of effort!</p>
