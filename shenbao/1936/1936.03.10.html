<h3>地理科講演　我們為什麽要學外國地理（績三月一日）</h3>
<p>— 中央大學地理系敎授　黃國璋</p>
<p>學習外國地理的第三個原因，可以利用世界各國適應環境的方法，作爲改進本國國計民生的借鏡，允其世界各國對於土地的利用，更足以作改良本國土地利用方法的參考。改良本國土地的利用，須從兩方面着手：第一，研究本國土地的狀况及其現在的利用方式，這就是我們學習本國地理的一個重大目的；第二，參考外國利用土地的方式，以改良本國土地的利用，那就是我現在所要講的了。</p>
<p>爲什麼外國利用土地的方法，我們可以參考，可以採用呢？這可以從兩方面來說明：—</p>
<p>各處土地利用的方法，不相一致——道叉可分三點說明：</p>
<p>（一）土地的利用與自然環境的組合情形有密切的關係——所謂自然環境乃由氣候，地形，水系，土壤，鑛藏，自然，生物及其與其他地方的位置關係種種因素組合而成。地球之上，沒有兩處自然環境組合完全相同的地方，但是在不同之中，却有大同之處，因此在土地利用方面也很多類似，例如中國種稻的區域，和安南，暹羅，日本，朝鮮，印度，爪哇，的種稻區域有許多方面是完全相同的；美國加拿大，阿根庭，俄國及澳洲等同是產麥而有大量出口地方，他們利用土地方法，被此相同之點也是很多。再如北美洲東部及歐洲西部那些工業區域，關於土地的利用更是很少差別。</p>
<p>大多數的地方，土地的利用並不限於一個方式，在同一的出地上面，可以採用好幾種不同的方法，並且都可以得到相當良好的結果，但是，所採用的方法，總得有一定的自然限制，如果所採用的方法不適合於土地的性質時，結果還是失敗。例如東三省的平原地帶，雖則可以種小麥，可以種高梁，可以種小米，可以種玉米，可以種大豆，也可以供畜牧，不一定限於那一種的作物，但是也有一定的限度，並非隨便那一種都可種植，假使以之種稻米及棉花，那就很少成功的希望。在那些自然環境純粹不同的地方，其土地利用的方法也就純粹不同，如我國西北的地方，大部分是沙漢及半沙漠地帶，耕地很少，人民以遊牧爲生，逐水草而居，道路少，村落稀，到處表示一種人口稀疏，民生艱苦的景象：到了東南農業區域，耕地遍野，道路密佈，農村在在皆是，都市也極發達，到處表示一種人民當庶，生氣勃勃的景象，與西北大部分比較起來，不啻兩個世界。就是東南農業區域以內，東北也大不相同，北部的棉麥雜糧區域與南部的稻米絲茶區域的景象判然兩異，而西南高原地帶與西北固屬大不相同，與東南也多差異之處。在同一個國家以內，土地利用的方法巳是如是的不相一致，國與國間的懸殊更是可想而知了。</p>
<p>（二）土地利用的方法與當地居民的多少與品質有關係——假使有兩處同是可以發展農的地方，一處人口稀少，一處人口稠密，在那人口稀少的區域，與其發展農業，到不如利用他的自然草塲去發展畜牧事業，比較適宜，至於在那人口稠密的區域，當然以發展農業爲尚。美國南部墨西哥灣沿岸一帶的種稻區域，其自然環境，與我國長江流域的種稻區域大致相似，然以美國人少，中國人多，使得一處用機器，一處用人工，其耕作方法完全兩樣。</p>
<p>除了人數以外，居民的品質也與土地的利用有密切的關係。居民對於人類各種職業應有的技術知識之程度，可以使得兩處自然環境相似的地方利用土地的方法，判然各異，如我西北沙澳地帶的居地，遂水草而居，所產的東西僅足供本地的需求；而住在美國西部及澳洲沙澳及半沙漠地帶的居民，採用大規模的畜牧方法以其所產，供給全世界之所需，以致人民的生活狀况與我國西北區城大不相同，此外如居民的勤惰，生活程度的高低，社會習慣以及政治組織的優劣，無一不使土地利用方法受到相當的影響。</p>
<p>（三）土地利用與一地對外的關係有關係——如對外貨物的交易，運輸道路的種類與長度，對外運輸的設備，對外交易所需要的金融機關和經理機關，如銀行及出入口貿易公司等，以及政府保護能力之大小，如不平等條的之有無，保護關稅之能否實行等，均足以形成各地土地利用方法之不同性。</p>
<p>各地土地利用的方法是變更不常的——地球之上，很少數的地方，人民利用土地的方法能經過相當長久的時間而不改變，在西方物質文化影響所及的地方，土地的利用方法，可以說是一代不同一代，甚至於一年不同一年。原來土地利用的方式與當地的自然環境，居民的多少及品質的優劣，以及對外的關係有生密切的關係，而道些都不是固定的，隨時都可以改變，爲應付新的環境起見，土地利用的方法，是必隨之而變。現在我國政府，正積極計劃利用科學方法，推進國民經濟建設事業，如築鐵路，修公路，設鋼鐵廠，設航空綫，改良作物種子，改良畜種，統制貨幣等等，這些都能使各省各地的環境，日新而月異。爲適應這些新的變態，土地的利用方法也是不得不隨時加以改良。例如湖南南部的居民，現在沒有一條南通廣州的鐵路，專靠人力，獸力與水力司交通與運輸之任，所以土地上下許多的富源，如森林，鐵藏等，因交通之不便，不易發展。本年十月長粤鐵路修成以後，在湖南南部居民的環境中，雖然祇是添上了一條人造的路綫，但那時居民利用土地的方法，一定要因這條路綫，無形中發生許多的改變。</p>
<p>歐洲各國乃是科學文明的倡導者，牠們利用土地的方法，許多可供我國的參考，允其是那些環境與我國彼此大致相同的地方，更足爲我們所效法。例如美國東北部及歐洲西北部的自然背景，與我國渤海區域（包括東北遼河流域及冀·察·晋·魯·各省）同是交通便利的煤鐵合產區域，歐美的國家旣能在這些地方發展工業，使之成爲世界最主要的北大西洋沿岸區城的重工業中心，我國文何嘗不能利用渤海沿岸造成北太平洋區域的重工業中心呢？假使我們早做到這一着，也就不會惹起別的國家的今日的垂涎了。不僅我國可以世界其他國家土地利用的方法來做參考，就是其他各國又何嘗不在彼此互相參考，現在特舉三例以明一般：</p>
<p>現在俄國開發中央亞細亞，所用的方法，輿埃及閒發尼雜河下淤的方法一樣，因爲這兩處都是沙漠之地，生長季節以內，太陽光熱都是很强，犬氣都沒有劇烈的變化，而同時都有江河水利之便，可以供給灌溉的需耍，埃及人能利用尼羅河下游種植棉花，成爲世界棉花著名的產地，俄國人當然也可以用同樣的方法去開發中央亞細亞的土地，經過幾年的努力，俄國人居然得到大大的成功。我國西北寗夏，甘肅，新疆一帶，很有許多地方與中亞的自然狀况幷沒有多大的差別，祗要我們能從內地修一條鐵路達到這些地方，同時改良他們的水利，使之便於灌漑，我想一定可以開關不少的良好棉田和果園，以供我們一部分需求。新疆吐魯蕃的棉花，素以品質優良著稱，每年用包裹郵寄天津的不少，足以證明西北的棉花種植業是很有發展可能的。</p>
<p>從前全世界所用的橡膠都是南美，巴西一國的出產品，後來橡膠的用途一天一天的擴大，國際間的需要一天一天的增加，英國不願受巴西的操縱，想在本國屬地以內我出可以出產橡膠的地方來，因而發現馬來半島一帶自然環境與巴西亞馬遜河流域極爲相似，就把巴西的橡種播種在倫敦植物園的溫室以內，然後把橡黃送到馬來一帶來栽培，結果很是圓滿，後來更由馬來半島，向荷屬東印度堆進，現在馬來及荷印一帶久巳成爲世界主要的橡膠產地。我國海南島具有低緯度的氣候，自然情形與馬來及荷印很相類似，祗須利用得宜，必然可以從事橡膠事業的發展。</p>
<p>美國西部與我國西北部自然狀况也很相近，並且同是畜牧地帶，美國政府於去年夏季特派遺羅力氏（Roelich）父子前赴內蒙古一帶採集耐旱植物之牧草種子帶回試種，以期改善西部大平原的牧塲。</p>
<p>以上所舉的例子，似乎偏重農業方面；實際上各種事業的開發均有參考外國的必要，外國地理的知識，隨處都可以應用得到。欲謀製造工業的發展，固然要明瞭國內的情形，但同時也要明瞭國外的情形，製造業所需要的原料及燃料，往往不是本國所能全部供給，非仰給於國外不可，製造業的性質及中心常須視內外原料及燃料供給地的情形來决定的。商業的發展也是一樣，商品的市塲不一定限於國內，國外市塲的距離，各國的競爭情形以及對外的交通路綫等，均足以作我們决定商業性質及中心地的參考，而這些知識都是非從外國地理學習不可。</p>
<p>最後，我更重複地總結一下，我們學習外國地理是有三個最大的原因，第一，可以明瞭國際間的相互關係。第二，可以明瞭我國在國際間所處的地位。第三，可以作爲改進國計民生的借　。（完）</p>

<p>招待本屆徵求會六十隊隊長隊員及捐欵</p>
<p>委員、並舉行開幕典禮、到者的四百餘</p>
<p>人、生氣勃勃、精神飽滿、爲歷屆徵求會</p>
<p>所未有、席間先由吳市長致開會辭、繼由</p>
<p>散、茲將詳情分紀如次、</p>
<p>到會人數　吳市長·王正廷·趙晉卿·</p>
<p>王曉箱·黎照　·錢新之·王延松·郭順·　雲祥·</p>
<p>沈嗣良，鄭希濤·郭乘文·汪伯奇·陳鶴琴·蔡勁</p>
<p>軍·潘　綸·徐佩璜·裴振　·王正序·卞毓英·陸</p>
<p>梅僧·　　灼·張上珍·　克昌·裝雲卿·縣執中·</p>
<p>梁小初·陳能方·錢化佛·張鳴欽·等四百餘人、</p>
<p>市長致辭　今天是上海靑年會第三十</p>
<p>六屆微求會開幕典禮、由鄙人邀請各隊長隊員</p>
<p>聚餐、相聚一堂、至爲快慰、此次的組織徵友方</p>
<p>面、分六十隊、又少年隊十隊、捐欵委員一百二</p>
<p>十人、總共參加本屆徵求的、有八百餘人、目的</p>
<p>爲會友五千人、會費六萬分、捐欵二萬元、共計</p>
<p>八萬元、我們照過去兩年的經騐及現在全體的</p>
<p>努力、可以深信本屆徵求會成績、非但可以達到</p>
<p>目的、且一定能够突破以往的紀錄、我們記得民</p>
<p>國九年、靑年會全國代表大會、在廣州開會時、</p>
<p>孫總理對代表演說、裏面有一節、說、「我們耍造</p>
<p>成一個好國家、必定先要人人有好人格、我國全</p>
<p>體當中、有完全人格的、就是靑年會、」這是孫總</p>
<p>理對靑年會最警惕最簡單而最能述明靑年會宗</p>
<p>旨的一句話、現在國人都在那裏呼號救國、有許</p>
<p>多地方、不但是呼號、而且已經直接間接的在做</p>
<p>敎國的工作、此種工作之中、最艱巨而最根木</p>
<p>的是什麼呢、是要建立中華民國、使中華民族</p>
<p>在世界能得到平等自由、但是照孫總理的指示、</p>
<p>要建好國家、須先有好人格、所以我們要知道、</p>
<p>我國能吾得救、民族能吾做到平等自由、先須</p>
<p>看我國民族的人格、能吾健全、孫總理所說、</p>
<p>「有人格的就是靑年會、並算除靑年會就沒有有</p>
<p>人格的團體、因爲靑年會是完全以提倡人格爲</p>
<p>宗旨、是可以造成完全人格的、我國人對於人格</p>
<p>兩字的解釋、往往過於狹義、大概以前的人、都</p>
<p>以爲淸高不貪汚、不做壞事、即算是好人格、但</p>
<p>這種解釋、殊不合於現在時代、因爲古代的社會</p>
<p>與生活簡單、現代複雜、以前做好人易、現在做</p>
<p>好人難、現代的人要應付現代的社會、要達到生</p>
<p>存的目的、所以現代人格的成分、不徒是消極的</p>
<p>做人、只有高尙的道德、還是不够完全人格、還</p>
<p>要知識能力、種種具備的人格、才算完全、才是</p>
<p>好國民、才可以建立好國家、所以從前的消極人</p>
<p>格、僅是獨善其身、現在積極的人格、還要兼善</p>
<p>天下、道種積極的人格、不是僅在家庭或學堂可</p>
<p>以造成、定要各方面合起來、方可建立、靑年會</p>
<p>就是以造成道種人格爲目的、所以靑年會是社</p>
<p>會道德的機關、不僅是說、還在努力的行、靑年</p>
<p>會既是社會的機關、所以大家應該來努力維助</p>
<p>共同循着這條路、謀求建國、復興民族、所以要</p>
<p>社會全體總動員、帮助這决的徵求會、一方面是</p>
<p>募捐、一方面更可測騐社會上對於靑年會所做</p>
<p>工作、是吾同情、今年的徵求會、既有八百人參</p>
<p>加、如此大力量、在一個月中活動、我想以諸位</p>
<p>的信仰和熱心、其影響必大、我所以對於這决微</p>
<p>求會、深信可以成功、預祝這次的勝利、</p>
<p>王儒堂演說　今天靑年會第三十六屆</p>
<p>徵求會開幕典禮、有這許多人參加、實在是好氣</p>
<p>象、我對於靑年會、有四種意義、　青年會總是</p>
<p>打衝鋒、如體育·如衛生·最初都是靑年會提倡</p>
<p>的、現在竟已普及了、　靑年會同志、都是努力</p>
<p>向前、如去年的徵求、時局不景氣、然竟能趨過</p>
<p>目的、　靑年會同志、能繼續不斷的服務、鄘富</p>
<p>灼博士、担任十三年會長、至今仍爲董事、　上</p>
<p>海爲全國的大都會、上海的靑年會、不但爲上海</p>
<p>社會服務、且能爲全國模範、今年的徵求會、有</p>
<p>這樣的精神、必能達到目的、我希望這種精神、</p>
<p>永遠的　　不斷、爲社會國家造福、</p>

<h3>馳名世界喜劇明星　卓別麟昨日抵滬　女星波麗德古黛偕行　定今晨仍乘原輪南航</h3>
<p>馳名世界經久不衰之電影喜劇明星却利卓別麟、於五年前究成「城市之光」一片後、會與其兄雪泥卓別麟東來旅行一决、惟因航輪經日本後、逕往香港、故未能來滬一遊、此番於其新作「庫登時代」完成、復偕由彼識拔之新秀女明星波麗德古黛女士、（摩登時代片中女主角）重遊遠東、於昨日乘大來公司之柯立芝總統號輪、過日到滬、定今晨仍乘原輪南航、其目的地爲百麗、茲特分誌其登岸前後各情如决、</p>
<p>登輪採訪　險被化裝逃逸</p>
<p>柯立芝總統號輪、於昨日下午一時靠泊浦江第十二號浮簡、接客小輪、於一時三刻、由新關碼頭開出、本埠中外各報社記者、前往採訪及攝影者／不下二十餘人、二時許、摩登柯立芝輪、顧旅客表上雖有卓別麟及波麗德古黛之名、其所住FD三號一等艙、亦經覓得、但迄未見其踪跡、乃正憶及彼遊歐時、在某旅舍爲記者及羣衆包圍、因而化裝脫逸之事、恐其重效故智時、竟發現彼在甲板上、於是卓氏乃爲數十鏡籍之集中點、「克察」之聲、不絕於耳、</p>
<p>紳士身份　並不類破靴黨</p>
<p>卓氏予一般人之印象、無論爲男女老少、智識階級或非智識階級，固無不知彼類一「破靴黨」、春行路姿勢之蹣跚滑稽、允爲一見即足使人忍俊不止者、顧彼與記者相見時、則爲一年的四十許、而髮已如雪之中年紳士、與吾人在銀幕上之卓氏彷彿者、惟其較短小之身軀耳、時古黛女士亦文其旁、倚欄而笑、女士年約二十許、嬌娜活潑、一如依人小烏、即傳說中之卓別麟夫人也、</p>
<p>揮手致意　流露滑稽姿態</p>
<p>當記者等於攝影完畢、擬對卓氏有所詢問時、卓即謂請於今晚六時半、往華懋飯店一晤、當可暢談云云、即偕古黛女士等下柯立芝總統號輪、乘特備之「吉卜賽」號遊艇、先接客輪、溯流破浪而去、彼於登輪後、見記者等彼遺於接客輪上、中心似有不安、故特於窗中揮手致意、於無意中流露其滑稽姿態、衆乃大笑、實則卓氏以能獲有今日之地位、亦正由彼在每一主演影片中、常有類此之眞摯情感流露也、</p>
<p>上海印象　祗一句太興奮</p>
<p>下午六時半、記者等重集於時而至、蓋卓氏舍舟登陸後、即爲友妤邀遊全市、作最初之觀光也、因導登五樓、入A字房間、此房佈置陳設、純爲英國風、爲華懋飯店當局所贈、或因卓氏爲英人也、古黛女士則寓同樓九號、與卓氏房間相對、卓氏入空後、即燃紙烟、傍壁爐而座、彼對上海作初度瞥視後之印象、謂「太與奮」、</p>
<p>婚姻問題　絕妙遁詞答覆</p>
<p>繼謂此次遊歷、係在影城好萊塢出發、經檀香山·日本·上海。將於明晨乘原艦去香港、轉往馬尼刺、百麗·印度支那。等地一遊、全部行程、的五月可畢、三月後、或將再來上海小住、卓氏爲唯一反對有聲電影者、僅主張配音以戲劇情趣「城市之光、」卽其嘗試而成功之作、此項主張、彼迄今猶未稍動、彼設有聲電影、處處均對演劇發生掣肘、故在「摩登時代」中、彼仍未談話、惟曾唱歌耳、記者有詢彼曾否與古黛女士訂婚或結婚者、彼莞爾而笑、此問題應山古黛女士置答、可謂絕妙遁詞、彼最近無繼續主演影片之計劉、惟擬編導一片、而由古黛女士主演、或傳彼擬在百麗、拍發一片資不可能、因攝片器械等、均一未携帶也、關於遠東問題、彼　謂在日本時、亦有人問其感想、未多說、</p>
<p>主演各片　博得一般同情</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（九）（五）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>唐恩把問句和答語一一聽得淸楚，他的心，想到和哈先生一同往游一個新世界，歡樂得在跳躍，又聽到那種荐舉的褒詞，使他近來的努力要不負他朋友對他的期望，居然得着了獎勵，眞是要感激涕零了。</p>
<p>在器械操之後，小橋和韜摩表演了那有名的趣劇，「有錢使得鬼推磨。」小橋既做得很好，韜摩扮演老農允爲出色；因爲他摸仿賴司務直使看客顚倒欲狂，賴司務自己也笑得合不住口來。因此亞西竟在他的背上拍了幾下，他們原是立在那個廳堂裏，望着那詼諧話劇，感覺得眞是十分有趣呢。</p>
<p>愛彌等到自己大笑已止，能够透氣的時候，才走到台上，化裝像個水手，唱給他們一個海上的歌曲，裏面有許多關於什麽「暴風雨，」「避風岸」等等，末了大家齊唱着：「揚帆呀，朋友們，揚帆呀！一聲震全屋；過後內達戴上一個寳塔尖的高帽，作一回異樣的中國式跳舞。因爲在梅莊不曾有過什麽公開的展覽，所以趁這機會也有若干學業上的表演。解客在黑板上計算的敏捷足以使聽衆昨舌。韜摩在拚法比賽得了第一，小橋讀一篇法文故事，那麽流利自然，坦第姨丈看了心中甚是歡喜。</p>
<p>當幕降落的時候，還沒見過一個小的孩子，大家問道：「別的孩子那裹去了？」</p>
<p>其時小橋已跑到他母親的身邊，預備等到那疑陣遂漸展開時爲之說明，但在此時却只說道：「呀，這便是要出奇制勝的地方。那眞是有趣，只可惜你還不知道。」</p>

<h3>江蘇省立鎭江鄉區衛生實騐區工作槪况（三）</h3>
<p>— 朱雲</p>
<p>我們到了諫壁以後，卽和該局主任劉悅之接洽，關於育嬰上一切健康管理事宜，概歸本處辦理，劉極表同情，遂於該局設嬰兒保健實騐處，開始檢查奶媽體格，及內堂嬰兒健康，寄養於外的嬰兒，分散於蔡家村殷家村廖家村等七十一村分別調查，並派護士訪問，指導育嬰保健等知識，有疾病者予以治療，每逢月之一二三日，寄母大批至接嬰局領取津貼費，卽利用時機，向各寄母講演育嬰，衛生等常識，聽者切合需要，於身攸關，收效甚大，內堂嬰兒，每日派醫師護士等輪流檢視，注重嬰兒日常生活及乳姆哺乳决數，僱用乳姆及領嬰之婦女，均須經本處醫師予以體格檢查，乳母日常營養物的配合及攝取，亦加以指導。</p>
<p>乙防疫工作一，兒童種痘一年四季，皆可種痘，而一般人民狃於積習，都等待春季接種，鄉區兒童，連春季亦絕少有種痘的機會。本處成立之初，卽購備大批痘苗，爲鄉村兒童免費施種，並廣爲宣傳秋季種痘的重要，計諫壁小學及各私塾，以及各村兒童來診療部接種者，共有五百餘人。二，白喉預防接種秋冬之交，天氣乾燥，白喉易於流行，爲事前預防起見，特購備大批白喉類毒素，爲鄉鎭人民免費接種：並印發大批宣傳品，作廣大的宣傳。事先由保甲長通知鄉民，至辦事處接受注射。同時，於諫壁小學學生，作錫克氏法測騐，九十六人中，現陽性反應者二十七人，均予以預防接種。</p>
<p>丙診療工作在連年饑荒加以醫藥窳敗的鎭江鄉區，鄉民有病，便發生兩種痛苦：一，無錢延醫買藥，二，找不到本領好的醫生。因此我們的診療工作，便博得他們極大的同情。不但消極的救濟了許多哀無可告之病夫，且藉此連絡鄉民的情感，在推進保健防疫等工作時候，便容易得多。四個月中，診療部共計門診人數三二二三，初診一一七三，複診二〇五〇，出診人數五六，急診二五，手術决數四五，注射人數二九五人。各項疾病人，以皮膚病爲最多，消化器病呼吸器病决之。</p>
<p>丁衛生敎育　一，母親會母親會是增進婦嬰健康改善家庭衛生的惟一集團，我們得到的助力很大。凡會經生育嬰兒的婦女，不限年齡，都得爲母親會會員。會設理事三人，由會員推選；再由理事互推常務理事一人，主持會員間聯絡事宜。凡有會員十人，卽得組織一會。由本處助產士護士等擔任指導，每月舉行談話會一决。二，農家看護訓練班利用農家休閑時期，舉辦農家看護訓練班。課程計有一，疾病預防法，二，疾病看護法，三，家庭簡易治療，四，育嬰法，五，種痘法，六，細菌學大意，七，免疫學原理，八，家庭衛生，九，家庭娛樂，十，救急，十一，實習，每日上課二小時，定三星期畢業。凡有五十家以上的村落，先行開辦。第一期在曉村舉辦，上課婦女有四十六人，訓練中缺誤者亦甚少。期滿後特組織畢業同學會，便利全村婦女們的聯絡。三，家庭衛生勸導隊本處全體工作人員，組織家庭衛生勸導隊，採挨戶勸導方式，勸導標準，分個人衛生家庭衛生公共衛生三類，個人衛生方面，一，不喝生水，二，不以手指入耳孔及口腔，不揉眼睛，三，常常洗澡，四，飯前和大小便後要洗手，五，不隨便探訪有傳染病的人，六，有了疾病就要請醫診治，七，不蒙着被頭睡覺，八，指甲要常剪，九，戒絕一切不良嗜好，十，知道注射預防針，家庭衛生方面，一，住的屋子要通空氣，二，屋子要天天打掃，三，屋子裏的東西要整齊，四，衣服要常常洗換，五，洗臉手巾應當各人分開，六，對傳染病的動物或蟲子，（蒼蠅，蚊蟲，老鼠，瘋狗，）應盡力撲滅，七，注意飲料水來源的淸潔，八，家長要督同一家的人早起，九，家庭中不作不正當的娛樂，十，子女婚期不過早或過遲，十一，不令子女搽粉穿耳束胸，十二，棺柩不停在家裏，公共衛生方面，一，不在河裏洗刷馬桶，二，不隨地大小便，三，不隨地吐痰，四，不隨地拋棄死畜，五，不隨地拋棄垃圾，六，不露天葬棺柩，七，有了傳染病應當通知鄰居。此項挨戶勸導方法，把衛生知識送上門去，很有效果。三公開演講，鄉間公開演講的方法很簡單，而收效却很大。我們帶了一面鑼，到了一個地方，鑼聲一響，全村的人民都來了。講的時候，材料淺易簡單，且夾雜多種滑稽而有與趣的引蹬，聽的人非常高興，講的人也自然覺得高與了。四化裝表演，利用演劇方法，去宣傳衛生，印象深而收效大，特組織衛生敎育劇團。演員除本處工作人員擔任外，諫壁前圩洩溝等校善於表演的學生亦參加。在前圩鄉表演時，觀衆達七八百人，頗極一時之盛。</p>
<p>僅僅四個月的光陰，在我們整個計劃中，僅做了一極小部份的事。然而我們自己引以爲慰的，保健防疫診療各方面所消耗的費用，我們沒有向上級機關請求一些事業費，同時，也沒有向地方入民收捐，完全由人民自動的來帮助推進。民衆受了免費接生和免費診療的利益，稍有錢的人家，都送錢來，（或東西來。）我們便拿來買牛痘苗白喉類毒素及其他藥品。最近月湖鄉紳士劉知先，捐了十畝零六分五厘的山田，給本處作建設公臺之用，已呈報民廳飭令嘉奬，一面與縣政府合作進行，籌設公墓。可見人民已自動的起來協助衛生事業的推進，漸向「衛生自治」的路上走去。</p>
<p>工作人員方面，袁方海高于一兩課長，以及醫師助產士護士等，都很苦幹，大家穿布衣，吃粗飯，和民衆打成一片，並且我規定每個人在鄉間至少要有五十個得到助力的朋友，我自己也如此。幾個月來，我們大家都已達到求友的理想。有形無形中，便有幾百個人做我們的助力，於事業的推進，當然是有益的。　　二十五年元旦於鎭江鄉區衛生實騐區辦事處</p>
<h3>起死回生（中）</h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十八—</p>
<p>此外，在康尼　地方，有一位科學家，名呌彭克洛夫股敎授（ProffessorWider　D.　Bancroft）的，却在努力着使死神的降臨比較延遲。據他說，被稱爲Sodium　Rbodanate的一種簡單的化學藥品可以使人的壽命至少增加兩年。對於過了四十五歲的人，這藥品能阻止他的神經和腦組織的硬化，又能增加對於疾病的抵抗力。</p>
<p>可是，使眞正已死的人眞正再活過來的事，我們還沒有聽到過。康納西博士，爲對於獵犬的試騐的成功所鼓勵，更進一涉作此企圖。目前，他正在搜集受毒氣刑的犯人的屍體作試騐的對象。他的計畫是這樣。把醫生宣告已死的犯人的屍體移到實騐室中，把牠縛在軒輊板上。第二步，被稱爲「甲希基靑」（methylene　blue）的化學藥品給注入靜脈管，使毒氣中和。純粹的氧氣給打入肺部，又把軒輊板緩緩搖動，使血液繼續循環。最後一步，他把給予生命的液體注入大靜脈中。這液體所含的，大部分是人體的新鮮血液，一部分是腎上腺素（adrenalin）。這藥物會使心臟作猛烈的收縮，因而使靜止的心臟重又跳動。康納西博士堅信：經過注射這液體後，死人一定會活過來的。他不贊同其他科學家的意見：如此復活的人的腦組織已遭不可挽回的損傷。</p>
<p>腦和神經組織，和其他特殊細胞不同，破壞得特別迅速。一個美國科學家說，心臟停止活動後，腦細胞便立卽開始腐敗。一個法國科學家却把腦細胞開始腐敗的時期定爲死後二十分鐘。許多科學家因此相信，卽使死人可以復活，他也一定成爲殘廢無用。康納西博士却不贊同此項主張。他所根據的證據就是給他試騐的那獵犬復活後仍然和以前一樣伶俐。</p>
<p>康納西博士所採用的方法，是由一個倫救醫生於一八五五年於無意中放下基礎的。這醫生名呌愛迪生博士（Thomas　Addison），是英國皇家醫院的醫生。他致力於發見療治一種奇病的方法。這奇病—後來被稱爲「愛迪生病」—影響心臟，使皮膚發銅色，使脈搏微弱而不規則。愛迪生發見這疾病是由於腎上腺分泌缺乏的綠故。腎上腺是人體無管腺之一，長的二吋，位居腎臟上部。這當時乏人知道的腎上腺的分泌液，對於心臟和血管是具有奇異的作用的。</p>
<p>自愛迪生公布此項發見後，腎上腺抽出物亦經研究者製造成功。據人發見，此項抽出物另具止血功能，因此在外科醫室中常被用作重耍的藥物。但此項抽出物頗難持久；一和空氣接觸，就立卽失却效用。因此許多科學家便致力於提鍊腎上腺的要素，而最後獲得成功的，則爲日本科學家高風博士（Dr.Jokichi　Takamine）</p>
<p>提鍊成敗之腎上腺要素是一種結晶體粉末，色白味苦，牠的發明者名之曰腎上腺素。這位日本科學家於一九二二年逝世，當時他那里决不夢想到他所製造成功的腎上腺素，到了後來居然完成一伴驚人的奇蹟。直至一九二三年，這奇蹟纔出現於紐的的聖路易醫院中。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問題</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（七十九）貧血　（下）</p>
<p>貧血病人，排出的尿液，有無異常？</p>
<p>貧血病人的尿，量多而透明。尿量每一天排出一·五公升到二公升。比重一〇一五—一〇二一。有時見有蛋白質含在尿中。</p>
<p>重症貧血的人，內臟會起什麽變化？</p>
<p>心臟，腎臟，血管等都要起脂肪變性</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>；尤其是血管的變化更利害，容易出血，或水分容易滲出，於是起浮腫或多尿。</p>
<p>貧血病人的體溫，和平常人有無異樣</p>
<p>在高度貧血的時候，起發熱，每天夕間見有攝氏表三十八度半到三十九度的熱。</p>
<p>貧血時發熱的原因，在那裏？</p>
<p>因爲血液中存在有毒性的蛋白體之故</p>
<p>貧血病人的血液中紅血球的數目是吾减少？</p>
<p>除急性失血而起的貧血外，血液中紅血球的數目，大概减少二成左右。就是每一立方耗中含有四百萬個上下。</p>
<p>血色素的比例，也减少嗎？</p>
<p>血色素量也减少四五成。</p>
<p>貧血者的血液中白血球，有無變化？</p>
<p>白血球大都沒有變化。</p>
<p>這種病的豫後，吉凶如何？</p>
<p>概屬良好。只要除去原因，便得逐漸恢復常態。</p>
<p>怎樣診斷貧血症？</p>
<p>先查發病的原因，再參考血液的所見；同時檢查大便中有沒有寄生蟲卵，那就可以確定診斷了。</p>
<p>這種續發性貧血的治療，應該怎樣纔算合宜？</p>
<p>第一要治療原病。其决用砒素劑和鐵質劑的內服或注射。再决行肝臟製劑的內服或注射。肝臟（牛猪的肝）的每天吃食，也有效騐。</p>
<p>在小兒往往也有患貧血症的，這是什麽緣故？</p>
<p>小兒貧血的原因，不外乎哺乳過久，營養障礙，常吃代乳品，體質異常，缺乏維他命食品，或先天梅毒癆病，或腸內有寄生蟲等。</p>
<p>小兒貧血的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>小兒貧血，皮膚呈蒿黃色，兩頰沒有血色，脾臟腫大，血液所見和成人的續發性貧血差不多；可是白血球却增多。</p>
<p>小兒貧血的治療方法怎樣？</p>
<p>小兒貧血的治療，應注重食餌療法，多吃含有維他命的菜蔬水果，並肝臟。此外常在日光充分空氣新綫的地方，或用人工太陽燈照射。有時行輸血療法。砒劑鐵劑，也可施用，但須注意。</p>

<h3>牙齒常識問答（二十三）</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一二問）喜吃糖菓的小兒，應該怎樣保護他的牙齒？</p>
<p>答　要敎他每吃後必須刷牙，把殘留食屑洗凈。至少限度，也須漱口一大，漱去殘渣。</p>
<p>（第一一三問）小兒在換牙時期，應該怎樣注意？</p>
<p>答　乳牙沒有到換牙時候，不可早期拔去，以免成人牙長得不齊，易於蛀壞。但是已經到了要換的時候，覺得動搖得很，就應立刻去，切不可任其留存，阻礙成人牙的生長；吾則成人牙必致參差易壞。</p>
<p>（第一一四間）小兒的上下顎齒槽四凸不齊時，應該矯正嗎？</p>
<p>答　如果上下齒槽弓發生凹凸，不但不美觀，而且咬合不止，易生蛀齲，應該及早請牙醫生矯正。</p>
<p>（第一一五問）乳牙的防護需要牙醫生的帮助嗎？</p>
<p>答　小兒的牙齒卽使自身注意口腔淸潔，隨時防護，但有時仍不免發生蛀洞。這些蛀洞，起初都是很小，不覺疼痛，自己找不出來的。最好每半年請牙醫生檢查一决，一有蛀洞就可立刻補好，免得愈蛀愈大。現在外國很多地方學校裏的兒童，都受牙醫生嚴密的監護指導，對於他們的口腔衛生方法飲食等項，都加以相當的注意，而且按期檢查牙齒記入表格，時常可以查考。據云：凡受這樣監護的人，牙齒都比軟的好，在成人時候，很少殘缺不全的。</p>
<p>（第一一六問）防免乳牙的蛀蝕，還有什麼簡易的方法，可以應用嗎</p>
<p>答　可用硝酸銀，把乳牙的咬合面，每半年塗一次。就是在永久牙第一第二大臼牙長出後，也可一併塗佈，卽使兒童到了十歲左右，若是覺得有蛀　的傾向時，亦宜用此藥，每年或每半年，把全部牙齒的表面塗抹一次，塗後設法使銀沉澱，若是有蛀触開始的地方，就會染成黑點，蛀得愈大，，染色愈深，所以這個方法，既可以遏止蛀齬的進行，又可以發現尋常所不易察出的小蛀齲。</p>

<p>耳翼濕疹的症候。概與一般皮膚濕疹相同。患者感覺　癢。耳翼皮膚發赤而濕潤。也可形成痂皮或膿疱。或來表皮剝脫。耳後或淺在頸腺。往往發生疼痛性腫脹或化膿。耳翼濕疹的治療方法。第一須去原因。應先醫治慢性耳漏或頭部濕疹。避免藥品的刺戟。其餘概同一般皮膚濕疹的療法</p>
<p>耳翼凍傷　我們在嚴冬初春的時候。常常不免發生凍傷。最易侵犯的部位。當推手，足，及耳翼。牠的痛苦。令人難受。耳翼最易受凍的部分。厥爲耳輪的後上綠。輕度的凍傷。祇感耳輪的知覺脫失。這是因爲血管收縮的緣故。中等度的凍傷。則發　癢或疼痛。這是因爲血管麻庫的綠故。高度的凍傷。則有形成水疱或潰〇。甚者竟可釀成壞疽。</p>
<p>耳翼凍傷的預防。就是設法保護耳翼。避兔寒氣的侵襲。至於牠的治療方法。概與手足凍傷相同。</p>
<h3>肺結核淺說（八四）</h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第八節　手術的治療</p>
<p>肺結核症之採及外科手術治療，無疑地是現代治療上一大進步！他在最初開始床時候，適應情形尚未完全明療，手術的方法，又不十分妥善，所以醫者根據最近臨床上的報告，平均在百人中，至少餓十五人係行使手術治療的：此曾經行使外科手術之病者中，大概有三分之二，係可得相當效果的。這一個數計，當然是相對的，有限的，遠不及白喉血清在治療上那樣百發百中：但卽此片面之成績而諭，其造福於人類之偉大，已很值得禮讚了！</p>
<p>怎樣呌外科手術治療呢？他的原理係何所根據呢？我們曉得，人們的肺部，如果由外來壓力之壓迫，他的組織可因之而呈萎縮狀態的。根據臨床上的觀察，尋常當本症的患者們，如果發生天然氣胸或滲出性胸膜炎子，他的肺組織時常在壓迫狀態下，這一種病例的預後，大半比較其他爲優良的。根據之一點原理，所以在現代肺結核治療中，也餓了「人工氣胸」一手術之採用了！他是用適量之空氣，注入患者胸腔裏面：此時肺胞受壓迫，血行　滯，呼吸時肺部不易伸展：間接則使肺組織內之病灶，不易蔓延，他部健全之組織，亦因空氣之壓迫，及血行之鬰滯，能使新結締組織之增生，病灶部分亦因以結痂而治愈；就是肺部發生的空洞，也可因之而愈着結痂的。所以這一種手術治療，雖然明明不是我們夢想的殺菌特效療法，但對於病灶部分之結痂，以及病灶周圍之結締組織增生，結果使病者日趨於痊愈狀態：這一種臨床上的成績，我們不妨大膽地說一句，是和理想的殺菌特效療法異曲同工的。</p>
<p>人工氣胸一手術，究竟適應於何種型式呢？第一，我們須要曉得，就是一切須行使人工氣胸手術之病者們，大半是重症的患者，對於輕症的本病，則無須多此一着的；這裹面除開早期空洞外，可說是沒有例外的。如就性質一方面說，則以增生性爲最宜，增生滲出性型式决之，單獨滲出性則大半結果不良的。總結一句，他的最適應型式，乃係重症的，進行性的，增生性的，一側的本病：對於發生空洞的病者，允覺來得必要！此外，對於屢發不北的咳血患者們，如果他的病灶是一側的，也是最適應症之一種，患者大致可因此而脫離生命危險的。對於病灶之僅限於一側以及蔓延兩側一層，從前醫家的意見，認爲兩側本病之行使人工氣胸手術，係完全不可能的，醫者須完全認淸一側的病者方可從事的；現在的適應範圍已漸擴大了，卽使兩側肺部結核，有時也可一樣行使手術了！這是很値得報告的！至於腸結核，脊椎炎，兩側腎臟結核，肺氣種，哮喘症，重症糖尿病，重症腎臟炎，心瓣膜病，等合併症；以及身體過分衰弱之病者，對於人工氣胸一手術，都是很不適宜，屬諸禁忌範圍之列的。此外像喉結核，一側腎臟結核，並非完全屬諸决對禁忌之列，如果喉部眞瘍部分不銀利害，以及腎臟結核患者一般狀態尙佳時，係仍舊可以施行的。</p>

<p>歐洲如有戰事發生油豆芝麻勢必打動洋麥來華將受阻礙粉麥油豆餅麻齊漲</p>
<p>標準油豆餅芝麻各市、昨日一律飛騰、實銷雖無客帮與洋莊等大量採辦、然市上人心莫不望好、因大連電訊曾有數度盤好、切以報載德軍移動後、歐洲戰事似有即將爆發之模樣、市上囤買突起興奮、又據連訊、該地亦有某方之投機收買、而滬市除浮卢之競先抵買外、更有業外投機、良以一般人意見以為歐洲果有戰事發生、則油荳芝麻勢必有大量洋莊去路、况且目下到頭不多、本客銷化尙活、脚地堅固、因此近遠各月份莫不上升、洋莊芝麻激漲一角八分、標豆激漲一角一分、標油近漲四角、遠期漲六七角云、</p>
<p>黃豆市况、因豆油現貨奇缺、市態緊張、又以豆餅銷暢活潑、統市做開各廠四牌餅四萬餘片、行情突見俏俐、故油餅原料得以繼續向榮、昨市漯河豆廠家辦去二千包、價為五元一角、泉州帮成交一百包、價為五元〇三分、其他蚌埠豆廠方採去四百包、駐馬店豆三百包、又訂進路貨通遼豆七車、價為五元、汕頭厦門本街採辦沙黃杜豆頗旺、統計交易二千六百包、高擋沙黃價已達五元而高貨杜豆亦提升三四分云、</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、呈一致良好之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲三四五角、坎拿大漲四角左右、市場人心、因歐洲時局變化、神經過敏者、以為戰事有爆發之可能、故近期有客戶拉進、遠期則業外之投機帮、吸進甚力、故漲度亦較甚、迨至下午開盤、本月份因由廠家套售、市氣轉定、惟六月份起之新粉、因恐將來洋麥難定、是以買氣仍暢、市面亦續提二分、結果近期漲一二分、遠期漲四五分至巨云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤、各月一致猛升、以洋麥報價回漲三四五角左右、更以歐洲事變、深恐將來擴大、一般人心思、當以洋麥不能訂購為慮、是以本月份開價、尙見平定、一至遠期、則交易甚暢、價亦高漲七八分不等、開內中業外買戶佔多數、業中人反多售出、迨至下午開盤、本月份上洛甚少、遠期則交易依然旺盛、起伏亦巨、觀察後步、將以國際變化為轉移耳、現麥市面、交易不暢、祗開九百包、山東麥五元二角三分　天台麥五元二角、由福阜申三家辦去云、</p>

<h3>薄稻市况稍見疲軟</h3>
<p>陰變元又加起四五分</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源近四十號、（貨共八千餘石）、內中薄稻佔其大半、故薄稻市况、雖經靑·烟·威等帮辦三千餘包、而結果形勢轉軟、行情小去七分、厚早粳本街成到銷兩平之局、故價仍屬平定、杜洋尖及陰變元悉無榮辱、</p>

<p>昨呢絨交易甚盛、惜天氣尙冷、致質銷略滯、國貨童華綿羊團九一八薄素嗶嘰、本街客帮銷路均旺、元靑·常靑·黃色更形暢銷、廠方出品、大有供不敷求之勢、因起質既堅固、而價亦較東貨為廉、兼以軍政學界、咸有指定服用國貨元色嗶嘰、故光彩雖暗而市銷仍廣、售價反見上漲、前九一八素嗶嘰、　批每碼祗售二元六角半、今則一律漲至二元八角矣、</p>

<p>現在靑年所需要的知識，必須能夠有批判「是否」力，否則，眞像瞎子一樣的無用，要在黑暗的社會　做個戰士，也不可能的了。</p>
<p>有人說：一個的自信力不要太强，是的，一個人的智　有限，雖然平時是一個很聰明的人，有許多時候却會變成一等的笨人，做出比任何人更笨的事。</p>
<p>「聰明一世，　　一時」，偉大的牛頓，也做過許多錯事，還是朋友和僕人指點他的哩！那麼，難道聰明的牛頓還不及他的僕人嗎？</p>
<p>這樣看來，一個人的自信力的確不要太强，因爲有時你們的思想也會錯誤，事情也要做錯，倘使只深信了自己，也是不可靠的。</p>
<p>總之，自信力固不可太强，也不可沒有，最好是事前三思。</p>
<h3>談閏</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>今年西曆二月，爲二十九日，　閏年也。意其定曆之初，或無學理根據，故月建大小，歲餘，閏日，皆爲刻板之式。若我國古歷則不然。於其測算之法，上究大文，下推地氣；恒人僅謂依日月行度而計，則猶未盡其理焉。</p>
<p>即以月閏之制，一端而言，據左氏傳注：「月　之　月節，每月各　一日，所有餘日，歸之於終，　成一月，則置之爲閏。」又班固白虎通云：「周天三百六十五度，四分度之一，歲十二月，日過十二度，故三年一閏，五年再　，明陰不足，陽有餘也。」此固釋制閏之由，夫人而知之者　而陸　渾天說云：「閏月無中氣，而北斗斜指兩辰之間，所以異於他月也。」是曆法於日月外，亦與星辰相關，故當月閏之年，有此感召耳！</p>
<p>若地氣相應之徵，則花木皆有可以取騐者；考　　　，謂：「黃楊木，性堅　　長，歲長一寸，閏則倒長一寸。」又謂：「梧桐能知日月正　，生十二葉；一邊有六葉，從下數；一葉爲一月，有閏則生十三葉；視葉小者，則知閏何月。」又謂：「藕生應月，月生一節，　輙益一。」復考雲南志，則謂：「和山花，似桂，每朶十二瓣，應十二月，遇閏則多一瓣。」又謂：「優曇花，狀如蓮，有十二瓣，遇閏則多一瓣；此花色白氣香，西域（殆指印度佛國）所來，亦娑羅花類。」皆其證也。</p>
<p>復聞彩鳳尾毛，亦與時歷關合；語見羽毛考異：「鳳毛十二翎，遇閏則生十三翎。」其下復談　樂云：「今樂府小調，尾聲一十二板，以象鳳尾，故曰尾聲；或增四字，亦加一板，以象閏。」書此，憶古代樂制之象時者，殊不僅此，若箏亦然；文獻通考有云：「箏，五絃，合五音；十二絃，合十二律；而十三絃者，其一象閏。」</p>
<p>我國稼穡之事，尤常聽令於歷，値閏之年，爲時須晚；齊民要術云：「凡田欲早晚相雜，有閏之歲，節氣近後，宜晚田。」此戴叔倫詩，所以有「閏年禾稼晚」之句也。若　西制，將失所據；故政府雖廢古歷，而仍以朔望節氣示人，俾以利農事焉。</p>
<p>其他有可談者：則爲「閏」字宇義，乃係　意一格。按三代時：「天子居總章元堂，每月各有其室，惟閏月則詔王居門，故　字從王從門也。」周禮注，釋之如此。</p>
<h3>寛　的　　　心的僕人</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>窰工</h3>
<p>— 丹霞</p>
<p>窰有磁窰，石灰窰，磚瓦窰等區別，下面所述，僅限於磚瓦窰一種。</p>
<p>有窰的地方，往往有這樣一句俗諺：『城裏大鋸子，鄉下大包子（即大饅頭）。』他們把城堞　作鋸子，把窰墩　作包子，倒也十分確切。因之，砌建窰墩最難的一部工程，却要算上面那個成爲穹形的頂面。那是絕非普通的泥水匠所能勝任的，非得請到俗所謂「盤窰司務」者不可。人數大概四人，工資特別優厚，還得用全席欵待，那是普通窰工所　羡不置的。</p>
<p>在平時則有「裝窰」，「燒窰」，「挑水」，「出貨」等等的工作。其中職責較重的，便要算「裝窰司務」。將泥坯很經濟地配置到窰內去，這是他們的工作。那自然也很需要熟練的手術；而且如果裝得不經濟，或是配佈不適當，燒成的磚瓦，出貨既少，且必大爲减色。這和窰戶的利益，很有出入。</p>
<p>其他，尙有一般臨時雇用的女工。——說是臨時雇用，其實伊們也有很嚴密的組織，輕易不許別人　入工作。——那是僅限於「掇坯」，「出貨」時纔用得着。統被稱爲「掇坯娘娘」。工資每次不過二百文左右，大概都屬年輕的女子。當一船坯載到窰塲的時候，只消有人高聲一呼，便四下雲集。穿梭也似的在窰塲上面來往，　聲嚦嚦，煞是熱鬧。逢到「出貨」的時候，伊們便預先穿起千綴百補的　舊的工作衣，準備和黑　的窰灰肉搏。等到工作完畢，一個個渾身烏黑，連面部也找不到一些乾淨的皮膚，祗剩烏溜溜的一對秋波，和血紅的半點朱唇。好在人家都已看慣，即使在人　中走着，也絕不爲異了。這也是平民女子職業的一種呢。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十四回　利熏　人輕傖夫割愛　志高雙足健壯士投荒</p>
<p>張老漢笑道：程老師，你這樣一個聰明人爲什麽問我們這樣的話？請問呵　能不是做官的人，誰能夠在小西天裏面住下。小西天的房子是我們經手蓋的，蓋完了房子，就不許我們這穿破衣服的人進來了，不是人應當做官才好嗎？志前望了他，點了兩點頭，因道：你果然是說得對的。這位王先生要做了官的話，你帮過他的忙，他一定要報答你的，你希望他怎樣的報答你呢？張老漢抬起手來，搔了的搔兩皮，笑着搖搖頭道：我叫他怎樣報答我呢？我這麼大年紀了，還想圖個什麽舒服嗎？我想，王先生將來做了官，給我們泥木作訂一條會規，過了五十歲的人，多給一毛兩毛的工錢。那就功德無量。程老爺，你是不知道，年紀大的人出力，可和小夥子不同。當時出力，已經是有些咬牙切齒。把工作過了，回到家裏去，眞會連話都不願多說一句。晚上在坑上躺著，害了大病　樣，只管發　。志前點點頭道；你還是仁者之言。人生在世上，總是互相帮忙的。只要你把王先生的事辦得好好的，我想王先生不會虧負你的。就是我從中作個說合人，看到你這樣的實力，也不能不感謝你。老漢，你只管去作你那預備好了的事。說着，他走近他的身邊，用手輕輕的拍着老漢的肩膀，表示兩個人那一番親近着不分階級的意味。這一下子，直鼓動得老漢眉飛色舞起來，他挺着胸脯子道：程老爺，你不要看我年紀這樣大，我這一腔子熱血，只要賣給識貨的。說着，伸開巴掌連連的拍了幾下胸。程志前道：你這一分仗義，提起了我的精神不少。張老漢道：程老爺，你就說罷，還有什麽事交給我去作，我若是有一點含糊，敎你程老爺算白認　了我。志前望着他臉上，微笑了一笑，然後點點頭道：我倒沒有別的事，還是爲了別人。你不聽聽那位胡嫂子，還在那裏哩哩　　，想出賣人家的骨肉。這還祗有你這種本地老漢，可以說　句公道了，把他壓了下去。（四一三）</p>
<p>他山之石</p>
<h3>日本學生的軍事訓練</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本從中學校至專門學校爲止，都有敎練一科，這便是軍事訓練，每星期大約兩小時。中學校除了軍事訓練之外，另有體操。而專門以上的學校，只有軍事訓練而沒有體操了。在我國大學裏的學生軍，是有名的少爺兵，脫了筆挺的西裝，而要穿着布的軍裝，大都要有些不開心。何况還要　着鐵槍操練，那是更要累死人了。平日高呼救國，只要鐵槍拿上手，便覺得　地嘗試，决沒有空口救國的容易了。</p>
<p>日本學生對於學術科目，有時要貪懶，缺席的。獨有對於軍事訓練，却非出席不可。如若缺席太多之後，分數不及格，更有留級的危險。其他功課，在敎室裏，還可以切切私語，或是隨便一些，只要敎官一到，個個面孔　然，身體也挺直了，要忍耐一小時，不能自由。敎官都是軍隊出身，大都是校尉，很有許多是參加過戰爭的。在黑板上　起中國地圖之熟悉，或者我國地理敎師，也要自愧不如的。東三省的地理更熟了，那裏是什麽堡，那裏有什麽河，大約多少　。日俄戰爭，是怎樣作戰的。滿洲事變，曾在那裏打死多少人。　雜的村莊，都可瞭如指掌。在上講堂的時候，除了　步兵　典之外，大都講演着從前戰爭時的實况。</p>
<p>日本軍事訓練的制服，和學生裝不同，是黃綠色的布質，每套僅三元多錢。上操的時候，還要加上刺刀子彈匣和綁腿布。除了天雨在講堂裏敎授之外，不論寒暖，未有間斷的。近來日本奇寒，早晨要冷到零下六度左右，軍事訓練，仍要舉行。敎官穿着呢的軍裝，長統軍鞋，白手套。而學生的制服是單的，那裏能　手套，立在風裏，兩隻腿都在那裏　動。</p>
<p>每年至少有一次實地演習，大約在東京郊外。共計三四天，每人便要繳四五塊錢的費用。常在路上看見學生背了槍，這便是各自到集合地去了。去年東京官立中學　操，有坦克車，野砲飛機等加入，顯然已較我國進步不少。他們是行徵兵制的，任何人都有當兵的義務，所以學生的軍事訓練，更是家常便飯了。有幾個學生在求學的時候，忽然接着了入營的通告，只得隨時停學，到軍隊裏去。這幾月的學費，可以免繳。</p>
<p>軍事訓練的敎官，便擔任學生監督，當然比我國的訓育主任要嚴。他管理着學生一切的行動，並處理缺席請假。日本學生見了他，沒有一個不恭而敬之的，較嚴的敎官，還要迫着學生剃和尚頭。　應大學的預科學生，曾因此而鬧過一次風潮。日本學生之所以都成和尚頭，都是因了軍事訓練。我國學生在　合訓練時，才剃了幾個月的和尚頭，已是萬分僥倖了。</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>閑話大鼓書</h3>
<p>— 黃白虹</p>
<p>大鼓書本名鼓兒詞，係指用扁鼓唱書的總稱。扁鼓並不大，其稱大鼓之由來；因從前鼓詞專演大部頭書，如三國水滸之類，現在所演已都變爲小段，不用大套，應逕稱鼓書爲切當。</p>
<p>鼓書是黃河流域的產物，乃由農哥　進，以村鎭而流入城市的。從前太平盛世，農事餘閑，大家圍坐場地上聽說，書（所以鼓爲矮脚）更用廢棄農具鐵片等來作和聲器，至今山東河南等地所稱的犁鏵片，尙有形迹可尋。然而一入都市，便不得不附庸風雅，於是犁鏵片偕音而爲梨花大鼓矣。不過扁鼓還是矮脚，只鐵片變爲銅片，本來面目，祗可想像而得了。所以頗有人認爲鼓書發源於山東，而現在的所謂梨花大鼓，乃是鼓書的老祖宗。</p>
<p>舊京住從前是首善之區，鼓書一入京都，於是矮脚鼓一變而爲高架鼓，銅片變爲小檀板；而音調亦由粗陋變成雅馴了。因之別成一派，是爲平音大鼓。</p>
<p>現在鼓書的種類，以地域言：可分爲平音（亦作平韻小調）大鼓，山東大鼓，奉天大鼓；若概括的說：不過平調大鼓與梨花大鼓，二類而已。（按山東奉天等均屬梨花鼓）就音調詞句等言：平音大鼓　已爐火純靑，清脆悅耳；梨花鐵片終不免野氣太重，所以鼓書正守，現在反要算平音大鼓了。</p>
<p>梨花大鼓之類，唱演者多爲女性，平音大鼓雖則男女均有，不過名手大都爲男性。這大概因爲鼓書須兼有身段表演，女子氣魄，究不及男性雄厚之故。至於梨花大鼓音調，根本剛直，女子唱來，尙可中和，男性演唱，反嫌粗暴了。</p>
<p>此外尙有：　八角鼓，據說從前是八旗人士的專門玩藝，來源於旗兵凱歌。嚴格說來，不應屬大鼓一類。　梅花調，（今通作梅花大鼓）據說是屬於八角鼓一類的，不過用器一切，均同大鼓，而照例中間有一套單弦。　太平歌詞，係淸唱而無弦樂。（按以上多屬北平音調）</p>
<p>說到鼓書材質，半多取自戲曲：如南陽關，長坂坡，華容道，別母亂箭等。近代皮黃流行，於是有些鼓詞裏，便插入皮黃調：　馬鞍山，子期聽琴，加二黃；空城計，南陽關，加西皮等。（於是更有巧立名目，稱爲皮黃大鼓）即唱時身段表演，亦不脫戲曲氣味。再說：一般詞句，也隨時可以找到些詞曲語調。所以有人以爲鼓書中，有些詞章，酷似元曲。大概鼓詞頗有些是文人手筆，不過作者大多不把各字拿出來，所以知者甚少。其中祗有韓小窗，　　西，是比較有名的。賈爲山東濟寗人，他的鼓詞曾編印成書，名爲木皮子詞。</p>
<p>我於詞曲，完全門外，不敢妄作解人。不過我對於鼓書，確很愛聽，我以爲鼓詞具有文學上的特點；一是趣味間適，二是格調謹嚴；三是接近口語。所以我認爲鼓書是很有他的前途的。盼望有文學素養，以及擅長詞曲的前輩們，來參加研究與改進它。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>不要希望人家</h3>
<p>— 譚</p>
<p>日本發生大爆變後，他們的結果如何，到現在爲止，尚難預料，但一件事變的發生，必是兩派的爭執，結果緩和和派失敗而急進派勝利，文人派失敗而武力派勝利，這句話可說是任何事變的定例。</p>
<p>一般閱報和關心國事的人，一聞此次日本事變，則惶然懼，若恐大禍之將至，聞廣田拜受大命組閣，則色然喜，以爲今後可高枕而臥，因爲廣田是主張和平政策，而不主張焦土政策的重要份子，其色然喜宜也，但廣田組閣，又因軍部的不滿，而遭碰壁，故日報謂「事變發生以來，爲不安之空氣所包圍之政局，方將放一綫曙光，不意軍部方面興起之惡氣流，突然擴大，此次順調安產之新閣，又將駛上暗礁矣」，又不免忒忒然而懼之。</p>
<p>天然，此次日本突變之由來，發生於何等樣人的暗示，當亦不問可知，現在廣田組閣，而對於林銑，眞　，阿部，荒木，照准辭職。此種情形，卽使目前敷衍局面，以後恐尚有不幸後果發生，故日報謂廣田之拜辭組閣大命，僅爲時間問題，（六日報載）又據七同盟社電，廣田昨與寺內會談結果，新閣今日可成立，總以上觀之，廣田組閣，縱得成就，亦決非廣田　　田之內閣矣。</p>
<p>故我敢斷一句，此次日本事變，激進派必不失敗，緩和派決不勝利，並且再說一句，無論那一派失敗，和那一派勝利，對於我國，亦絕對無利益可言，總之此次日本內部意見的爭執，和我國絕不相干，所謂緩和與急進，所差者僅是方式的不同，手段的不同，而其雙方根本的主張，原是一貫。</p>
<p>同一罪犯，焦土是用槍斃或梟首的方式來解決，和平是用淩遲或立籠的方式來解決，其用刑的手段，雖有緩急之分，而該犯人之宣告死刑則一，所以我們當立定脚跟，打定主意，劃定步驟，無論他們焦土也可，和平也可，焦土，以焦土的手段對付，和平，以和平的手段對付，否則焦土可懼，和平何嘗不可懼，焦土可危，和平何嘗不可危，故我根本上不希望人家。</p>
<h3>田鷄</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>——故鄉的春鮮之一——</p>
<p>上海不很容易吃到田鷄，時鮮攤上就很少見，只有北四川路武昌路一帶的廣東魚鮮店子裏買得到。上海人不喜歡菜館裏烹賣的田鷄菜色，肉味就不見得有好吃，胃嫩的人或者根本就吃不下咽。偈我們吃過那樣好滋味的故鄉田鷄的人，優劣尤易辨出，萬萬騙不過這張口舌的。</p>
<p>故鄉的田鷄是屬於珍貴菜食之一價錢賣得很高，肥大一點的一塊錢只能買四五只。烹法很多。炒，燜，燉，煮，紅燒都各有各樣烹法的特具風味，皮肉已嫩且鮮，骨節入口穌脆，絕無老澀難吸等劣味。時鮮店子裏一年四季都有得賣；不過普通小喫店裏仍然沒有這樣的菜色，鄉下人是很難吃上起碼要六七角</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>錢，纔有一小碗的田鷄菜食的。有時爸爸媽媽偶然在水田裏捉到一隻小田鷄，回來燉碗米粥孩子們吃，可眞快樂不過</p>
<p>捕田鷄的都是專業，大概不外是下釣翻穴兩樣法子。下釣多在夏天，但成績有限，所以很少人玩；秋冬兩季田鷄都伏入穴裏，正好就穴搜捕，捕的也比較多，一個善於捕法的人，運氣好時一天，常可以捉到數十隻，不過這般人都是吹大烟的老槍階級，做一日吃一日。全無一定計劃。故鄉人有甸俗諺說：「打蝦子買姻食，水來火去。」就是形容這般人的生活態度。</p>
<p>捕田鷄也要懂秘訣，第一要能够看川什麽樣子的泥穴是田鷄穴，什麽樣子的又是蛇穴，一點不能糊塗，再辦淸田鷄走開了抑還藏在那兒，然後下手搜捉，這些法子據說都要經過師承纔懂。捕田鷄的人還有一稱人所不及的智識，就的他們能够從田鷄踏在泥穴門口的爪跡深淺繁瑣上看出天氣的雨晴，無不應騐。所以他們也常常成爲鄉下老太婆的義務顧問。</p>
<p>春天來後，及至驚蟄一過，蟄伏穴的田鷄都姚到水田電來了，捕田鷄的就又變個法子，在夜裏帶起火把到水田秧地裏去，蹲在一個角地裏，掩熄火把慢慢做出閣閣閣的呌聲，把遠處的田鷄誘前來，大約聽得前後左右水聲活刺不斷時，再以迅速的方法把火燃亮，就可把一隻一隻的田鷄捉到篾簍裏來。榖雨過後，據說田鷄都變得很馴服，火把一照，卽蹲伏在地下任人捕捉。若是日裏又下過一陣過雲雨，天氣反覆無定，地氣驟熟，那麼一個下平夜幾分鐘頭內捕上百數干隻也極平常。</p>
<p>關於榖雨後的田鷄還有一段很古怪的俗說，據云這個時候的田鷄常常會在古潭或除澗中，集合千數百隻結疊起一座塔體，在最後來一隻田鷄下面又必然有一隻很惡毒的水鼈蛇守在那兒，捉時就不可全數捉盡。但是否有人碰見過沒有，又沒有下文了。</p>
<p>一年四季就以春季一季爲田鷄市塲頂旺的時期，且因經過一冬的蟄伏，皮肉都格外綫嫩肥大，自然又更好吃了。但據我所知，故鄉附近的田鷄產量老早就很少了，本土所出的當然不够供應，現在市灘上所售的都是從上門一帶山縣裏批來的，混充本地田鷄發賣，肉味就遜色得多。不過比較上海廣束菜館裏的又勝過十倍罷了。前回曾風聞有人擬計劃一個專門養殖田鷄的農塲，若果能够實現，倒是一種很新綫的事業？</p>
<h3>家書</h3>
<p>— 蔚雲</p>
<p>父親從鄉下接連寄了三封信來，最後一封是快信。故鄉直角鎭是萬縣鄉下的一個小鎭，到萬縣，再坐一夜的航船到達；而航船是每隔三天開一班的。鎭上又沒有郵局，信件的轉遞是一家呌做萬利雜貨店的代辦的，每三天由航船帶到萬縣投郵。外來的信件亦是如此。但是他們不帶快信，掛號信，理由是要蓋用印章的東西他們不肯負責。所以鎭上要寄快信，就得親自赴萬縣投寄，要是航船班頭不凑巧，要在萬縣過宿。那是最麻煩沒有的了。當我接到最後一對快信的時候，我以爲家里出了亂子，才這樣不辭辛苦投寄快信。然而信里的話興以前二封一樣，不過在「你回來罷」四字旁打了密圈。信里的話是：二弟結婚了，三弟也要結婚了，你常年飄泊在外面，做父親很是不安心。家里不是沒有飯吃，你回來罷，下月是母親的三週年，應該到墓上去叩頭的。提到死去的母親，我深深地戚動了。母親死後三個月，父親就娶了個靑年的妻子進門，不到一年，添了現在的四弟，家庭間－母寗說父子間就隔了深深的鴻溝。我如不過彷彿姐姐一般年齡的母親在父親面前做家庭的劊子手，借着想做一點事業的藉口跑了出來，已經二年了。我走後，父欽似乎很後侮的樣子，他時常投意二弟三弟寫信要我回去，二弟三弟却明白地寫出那是父親的意思。他們不是不希望我回家，他們告訴我這個家比我出走之前更不像樣子。二弟媳就受不了那個年輕婆婆的指桑駡槐，曾兩次尋死覓活過。對於那件事，父親沒有話說，彷彿他沒有聽到，看見一樣。他忘了母親臨終的遺言，要他好好照顧我們兄弟三個。他沉醉在年輕妻子的懷抱里，他忘了做父親的責任，快信里他忽然提到母親的三週年，或許老年人的心中懷念着前妻的賢淑吧，我打起精神來回家了。</p>
<p>是一個下雨天，父親帶着二弟三弟到航船碼頭來接我。在到家的路上我們沒有說話，父親祇是偷偸地向我打量着；但是他顯得非常興奮的樣子，走路還是那樣地飛快。走重萬利雜貨店，他向三弟說：「我打二斤酒，你們先到家罷。」那天離三弟的婚期只有三天了，家裏有很多客人，都是現在的母親面上的，我沒有向他們招呼，到父親的書房休息了，沒有掌燈時分，父親在客應裏間着我，馬上就到書房裏，很高興地拍拍我的肩頭，把我行囊隨意翻了翻，吩咐僕人晚膳開到書房裏來，‘我們父子四個在一盞煤油燈下默默地各自喝着酒。二弟三弟故意問我在外面的情形，但是父親始終沒有接口，他幾次停住酒杯，又很快地喝乾了，酒量很好的樣子。</p>
<p>當夜我宿在書房裏，二弟三弟偸偷地進來幾决，沒有說幾句又出去了了。</p>
<p>第二天早上二弟告訴我母親和父親昨晚上吵了半天，父親似乎沒有睡，一淸早紅着眼睛出門了，說是去邀幾個親戚。我彷彿在做夢，自己問着我回來幹甚呢？父親年老了，他受得了這般的刺激嗎？而我又不能照着他所想像的做兒子的。</p>
<p>沒有到中午，一個女人的聲音在隔弄裏駡傭人。隔弄就在書房背後，二弟對我伸着舌頭，用小指頭向我示意。但是外面罵得很起勁：</p>
<p>「想做客人嗎？睡到太陽曬着屋脊像什麽樣子……」</p>
<p>第二個蒼老的聲音接口了，是父親，他說：「慵人偸賴，動什麽火勁呢？」邊說着他踏進書房來，手裏提着一瓶酒，但是他停在書房門口半天沒有說一句話。</p>
<p>二弟接過他手裏的酒瓶，外面的駡聲又像雷一樣地轟着。</p>
<h3>瞎話</h3>
<p>— （吹）</p>
<p>日本廣田弘毅組閣，英國表示滿意。譚老三曰，廣田主張和平政策，而不主張焦士政策者，看起來似乎好些，但是焦土政策似虎烈拉，和平政策似肺癆病，在傍人看似好些，當局均戚難受，並且廣田受環境的迫脅，肺癆病安知不變爲虎烈拉呢？</p>
<p>美海軍發覺國際問諜案，查出竊取有價値海軍秘密文件，售與某外國事，譚老三日，我國的小癟三，拋頂宮，摸皮夾，竊墨水筆，是他們拿手好戲，但是國際間竊賊，偸竊海軍秘密文件，大癟三與小癟三之分，眞是天差地遠，宜乎竊鈎者詠竊國者侯。</p>

<h3>青陽港的初冬（十三）</h3>
<p>— 秋原</p>
<p>在客室視的椅子上，發見了留聲機及一些唱片，一張一張的唱了起來。　　——這張多好，你聽。</p>
<p>——這還沒有反而的好！看。</p>
<p>——這是　Diaen”怪好聽的。</p>
<p>——前而的那張是男性的，反而却多少有點女性，瞧，這個名字多好，音調又那麽如怨如訴的，DiaenMyDiaen。</p>
<p>秋華走了過來，將她的手抱住了卓民的臉，很有力的，同時又很短短的吻了卓民；卓民却消在籘椅上，聽那如怨的音樂。也感到恬靜，也感到人主的意義與價値；日子永遠是這樣，那還有什麼可以羨慕的呢？然而，在卓民所感覺到的，不僅是這短短一吻的滋味，倒是這吻以外的悄緒。任何女人都會吻他，但是同一吻，其滋味之所以異樣者，不僅是吻的本身，如吻的環境，吻的時間，吻的人物，倒是在這吻以外的情緒。在別人，除了官能的感覺以外，更還有什麽？同一吻，有的是官能的享受，有的却是超官能的。在官能以外，還有什麽似的。假如說僅僅是吻，那根本可以說不値半文錢。所以當秋州華吻他的時候，卓民所感覺到的恬靜，不祇是官能上的滿足，倒是像把握了信仰，一種心靈的超脫，得到一種更偉大更崇高的什麽似的。這些，惟有在秋華，才能使他餓這些情感。</p>

<p>叛徒</p>
<p>叛徒是一幕寫社會醜惡和殘酷的寫實劇；叛徒裏有從封建勢力家庭間掙扎出來作了叛徒的女子——朱文瑛。</p>
<p>叛徒裏有第一次作了對封建勢力下的叛徒和，第二次作了上帝叛徒的軍官——瑞伯。</p>
<p>叛徒裏有專奉承有錢有勢上等人家少奶奶的，和沒有了錢會換一副嘴臉對人的看護——沈小姐。</p>
<p>叛徒裏有看見年靑女人色迷迷，假殷勤的醫生——張醫生</p>
<p>叛徒裏有帶着假面具說仁慈愛人類，其實比狼心還要狠得——老牧師。</p>
<p>叛徒裏有狼狽為奸的看護——王小姐。</p>
<p>朱文瑛和鄭瑞伯由戀愛到達極點，而沒有結婚就同居了，因此他們二人做了對封建勢力的叛徒。</p>
<p>二人在同居的必需過程中，文瑛是肚子裏有了小孩這時候瑞伯亦在軍隊裏面做了連長。</p>
<p>文瑛因為將要生產而搬住醫院裏，她住的是二等房間，所以醫院裏的醫生和看護都同她很要好。看護沈小姐跟她結為了姊妹，張醫生和她認為兄妹。而且還認了一位在醫院養病的老牧師做了爸爸。這樣一來妹妹哥哥爸爸都有了，所以一點也不寂寞過的生活很快樂！</p>
<p>不過她肚子裏的孩子在還沒有熟透有下來可能的時候，已經開始一陣陣的熱烈的肚痛。</p>
<p>忽然她的丈夫瑞伯會在軍隊出發前綫路過這裏的時候偷出來探望她，文瑛當然是很快活，可是後來爲了瑞伯只帶了二十塊錢付不出房金和醫費而受到沈小姐的瞧不起，張醫生亦爲了她的男人在這裏不好意思向她色迷迷，所以看一看寒暑表就跑出去了！文瑛還向老牧師懺悔她和他二人過去的事情，希望老牧師同情他們，但是老牧師聽到後，板起了面孔連女兒也不認了！在這時文瑛和瑞伯方才打破了現在新觀念「世界上還有好人」，更堅决的確定了從前的舊觀念「世界上沒有好人」。</p>
<p>當這時候軍隊的號角吹起來了！因為瑞伯是偷出來的，倘使此時不去就要受軍法處罰，但是他又不忍馬上就離開在床上肚子痛得打滾的妻子，猶豫不决的時候，第二次號角又吹起來了，可是文瑛更痛得利害，當然他是不能這樣硬心腸就走，但是事實上却不能不離開！</p>
<p>終於是瑞伯一槍打中了文瑛肚子裏的氣生子，解决了這一　事情再做了個上帝的叛徒。</p>
<p>這時候文瑛是不會再肚子痛了！瑞伯是可以不要離他的妻子了！</p>
<p>老牧師看到這情形拿了個警笛預備吹出來。被瑞伯奪過來，放在文瑛嘴裏，要求她這最後的一口氣從這個銀角裏吹出來，是的文瑛的最後的一口氣含笑的從這個銀角裏吹了出來！老牧師在旁邊喊出「這二個上帝的叛徒」！</p>
<p>此時遠處有軍隊聞赴前綫的行軍曲聲。由響西漸了低下去！到隱約而聽不見。</p>

<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「春愁曲」</p>
<p>斜橋入院峭寒生。空寂繍房賓鴨溫。惜別思春春宛照。侵尋夢影夠銷魂。懨懨病起梳妝懶。中酒扶頭瘦不禁。想到，昨夜燈花纔報喜。但是，佳期淺淡不分明。可喜，鸚哥意重吟詩澀。但是，燕子心痴訴恨頻。早已是，廿四番風花奇信。只是游絲亂絮閣紗　。曾記得游園踏遍平無路。一種情憐刻骨深。曾記得，自在廉鈎書館靜。堂深送過打棋聲。曾記得，十三鈿柱琴挑剔。玉潤珠圓，眞是白雲音。曾記得，屏底猧兒窺醉眼。瑤台人醒鳳釵橫。那一日，匆匆掩袂陽關道。馬滑霜濃月下行。到如今，欲遣靑靑河畔草。將愁直到短長亭。只落得，裁衣蜂蝶無聊賴。偷買胭脂抱落英。所以，目斷橋邊烟水綠。木蘭堂北踐殘春。埋怨東皇忒費心。</p>

<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 之爾</p>
<p>「據說「哲人並不是徐蘇靈的化名。這的確是很有趣的事。「某種人時常化名來替自己吹捧，欺騙羣衆，」那是慣技，已用不到再說了；但是，在「積極地幹起來」的，並且是幹出「一點」成績來的，可不是之雨，那麼之雨還「替自己吹捧」些什麼呢？可「吹捧」的祗有哲人先生之流呀。</p>
<p>舒繍文和潘孑農的分居，記得我們先前已經說過了，但是不久之後又有一位「英雄」跳出來說這是有挑撥作用的謠言。理由是他跟「外子」（怒我再引用一次「舊式」稱呼）很熟，据他知道，「內外子」是很和睦的。</p>
<p>現在，舒潘分居的事是漸漸地證實了，那位「英雄」那裏去了呢？不知道。大槪是又搖身一變變成別一副嘴臉了吧？</p>
<p>幹了的事要想使人不知道是不成的。「英雄」們！</p>
<p>哲人先生大槪是由「謙遜」而「放縱」起來了。要看「英雄」們的「原形，」「放縱」是比「謙遜」更好的，因為妖怪們變成美女的時候，妞妞嫋嫋的是得講一點「謙遜」的，而等到沒辦法而「放縱」起來，那已經是原形畢露。原形畢露雖然顯得猙獰可怕，然而使觀衆一見到就望而却步，不致再受迷惑，那一點無論如何於觀衆是有利的。</p>

<h3>Authorities of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Provinces Agree on Methods for Clearing Border Areas; Border Areas of the Three Provinces Divided into Three Clearance Zones; Commanding Officers Appointed with Deadlines for Suppression</h3>
<p>Hankou: The authorities of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces continued their meeting at the Hankou Garrison Headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 9th to discuss border area issues. Tan Daoyuan and Luo Lin rushed to participate in the meeting, which adjourned at 4:00 PM. According to the Hubei Pacification Headquarters, the border areas of the three provinces, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, had previously failed to achieve close military and political coordination, and sporadic bandits were able to flow from one area to another, preventing complete suppression. Recently, the Governor-General's Headquarters, the Pacification Headquarters, the chairmen of the three provinces, and the generals and commissioners stationed in the border areas have been meeting in Hankou for several days to discuss clearance methods, which are roughly as follows: The originally designated border areas of the three provinces, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, will be divided into three clearance zones, each with one commanding officer and one deputy commanding officer, with deadlines for suppression. During the clearance period, all civil and military officials should perform their duties without regard to jurisdictional boundaries and should not shirk responsibility. Those who do so will be punished according to the regulations for rewarding and punishing civil and military officials in the bandit suppression area. All civil and military officials responsible for clearance should be stationed in bandit-infested areas, get close to the people, and supervise diligently. All important counties in the clearance zones will temporarily be treated as first-class county vacancies, and the strength of the local administrative offices will be enhanced. Outstanding county magistrates should be selected and transferred to the counties in the bandit areas. The counties in the border areas of the three provinces that are connected should maintain contact with each other and cooperate in the clearance based on the principle of joint defense. The highways in the border areas of the three provinces should be quickly completed and connected. The telephone lines in the border areas of the three provinces should be quickly completed and interconnected. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Hankou: The post-clearance policies for the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi have been concretely agreed upon on the 9th. He Chengjun met with Tan Daoyuan in the afternoon. He Jian hosted a banquet for He Chengjun, Yang Yongtai, Chen Jicheng, and others at 7:00 PM on the 9th and plans to return to Hunan on the 10th. Xiong Shihui, due to Yang's persuasion, changed his return to Jiangxi to the 10th. Tan Daoyuan, Luo Lin, and others will leave Hankou on the 12th. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Hankou: The border area clearing conference convened by the Governor-General's Headquarters, the Pacification Headquarters, and the chairmen of the three provinces, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, continued in Hankou on the 9th. The commissioners and district commanders of each area participated. According to the Pacification Headquarters, eight proposals were resolved on the 9th: 1. The border areas of the three provinces will be divided into three clearing zones, each with one commanding officer and one deputy commanding officer, with deadlines for suppression. 2. Civil and military officials should not differentiate between regions, and they should not evade, or they will be punished. 3. The civil and military officers responsible for the clearing should be stationed in areas with bandits, close to the people, and diligently supervise. 4. and 5. Important counties in the border areas will be treated as first-class positions, and the strength of the district offices will be strengthened and outstanding county magistrates will be selected and appointed. 6. The counties bordering the border areas will join forces to encircle and suppress the bandits. 7. and 8. Highways and telephones will be quickly completed to facilitate military affairs. The conference has now concluded, and He Jian and Xiong Shihui will return to Hunan and Jiangxi immediately. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Central Government and National Government Jointly Hold Anniversary Commemorative Week; Reported Separately by Wu Jingheng and Chairman Lin</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Central Government held the Fourteenth Decision Commemorative Week at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Vice Chairman Jiang, Central Committee members Lin Sen, Wu Jingheng, Jing Hengyi, Zhang Ji, Shao Yuanchong, Kong Xiangxi, Zhou Qigang, Zhang Lisheng, Zhou Fohai, Jiang Zuobin, Liu Wendao, Zhu Peide, He Yingqin, and all staff members, totaling 800 people, attended. Chairman Wu Jingheng also reported, stating in essence that construction in extraordinary times is different from ordinary times. He believes that during this period, schools must become militarized and factories must become militarized. The meeting adjourned at 9:40 AM. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: Wu Jingheng delivered a speech on "Construction Methods in Extraordinary Times" at the Central Commemorative Week on the 9th. He stated in essence that the Premier once said that there are two aspects to a new construction strategy: one is spiritual and the other is substantive. The so-called spiritual construction is nothing more than reforming politics and restoring morality, while the so-called substantive construction is to develop industry. However, in extraordinary times, we cannot let it progress naturally, but must use a controlling method. Currently, in the spiritual aspect, there is a tense New Life Movement, and in the substantive aspect, there is an economic construction movement. These two cannot be lacking and one cannot be overemphasized. Moreover, substantive construction should pay more attention to scientific machines, so as to catch up in this extraordinary period. All construction always requires organization, knowledge, and work. However, the military has the best discipline, schools have developed knowledge, and factories work hard. During this period, we are willing to give the military more knowledge and work, schools should increase discipline and work, and factories should also develop knowledge and discipline. Only in this way can we all strive for the country and obtain great strength. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Nanjing: The National Government held a Commemorative Week at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. Zhang Ji, Kong Xiangxi, Deng Jiayan, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Chen Xunyong, Cheng Qian, and other officials from the various departments of the National Government, totaling more than 500 people, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave a report on "Be Diligent and Brave, Be Trustworthy and Loyal" until 10:30 AM, when the meeting adjourned. (9th Central News Agency</p>
<p>Nanjing: Chairman Lin reported on "Be Diligent and Brave, Be Trustworthy and Loyal" at the National Government Commemorative Week on the morning of the 9th. He first stated that China is now in an extraordinary period, and the world situation may undergo drastic changes. Public officials across the country are standing on the front line of saving the country from disaster and revitalizing the nation, with great responsibility. We must invigorate our spirits, correct old habits, uphold the Premier's teachings of "Be Diligent and Brave, Be Trustworthy and Loyal," and shoulder the important task of serving the country. He resolutely stated that adversity builds nations, which is a historically revealed fact. We should have an extremely firm confidence in the fate of the country, and we should be based on the Premier's spirit of great fearlessness, struggle at all times, and never be pessimistic, passive, or cowardly, to prevent the belief of saving the nation. Public officials across the country should be further encouraged to initiate greater confidence and strive to be loyal to their duties. Finally, he said that government officials at all levels should lead the general public officials to self-examine and self-reflect at any time and place, seek knowledge and practice, and have the greatest perseverance and long-term perseverance, perform their duties and serve, and exert their effectiveness. Public officials should serve as an example to the people. If they can all deeply understand the Premier's teachings and practice them consistently, they will surely be able to lead the people to strive and strive to fulfill their duties.

<h3>Director of Tianjin Shipping Bureau Inspects Outside the Port by Ship; Comforts Passengers of Distressed Ships; Merchants of Fresh Goods Demand Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Pan Yaoxiang, Director of the Tianjin Shipping Bureau, took the Xinhua ship outside Dagu Port on the 9th to inspect the situation, to comfort the passengers of the distressed ships, and to propose relief measures. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Dagu Port has been frozen for fifty days. A total of 21,000 tons of goods are awaiting shipment between Tanggu and Tianjin, and 5,700 tons of goods are stockpiled in Dalian awaiting shipment to Tianjin, all awaiting loading. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: After the ice situation at Dagu Port improved, the solid ice at Lao Tieshan is also gradually melting. Ships such as the Tianjin Maru have entered the port separately. Pan Yaochen, Director of the Tianjin Shipping Bureau, went to Dagu on the 10th to inspect. He took a ship from Tanggu, and there were still many ships traveling along the way, but there were still large chunks of solid ice floating in the river. The Tianjin Hua ship he was on was violently shaken as a result. The situation outside the port was the same, but there were many ice floes in the north and south ports, but they no longer hindered navigation. There are still three ships, Samsung Feng, Yili Yi, and Jin San, that have not started due to mechanical damage. Passengers have been rescued to Tanggu by icebreakers, all disheveled and dirty, as the Yi Jin Maru was trapped for fifty or sixty days. The authorities are now trying to tow these three ships into the dock for repairs. Yang Zheren, a section chief of the Shipping Bureau, inspected the distressed ships. In addition to the three ships in the north and south ports, there are also Shunli, Yongheng, Zhonghe, Changan, Jinsheng, Luzhou, and Ganzhou, totaling seven ships. The mechanical damage is the most serious. As a result, the frozen disaster has affected the stagnant trade in Tianjin Port, which has become active. (9th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Representatives of Tianjin fresh goods stores and guilds requested that the shipping industry and insurance companies compensate for the losses of goods. It is said that the fruits transported by various merchants to Dagu Port were rotten due to the ice. However, Tianjin Customs still collected taxes as usual, and the losses of various merchants were extremely heavy.

<h3>On the Hirota Cabinet</h3>
<p>— He</p>
<p>Elder Statesman Saionji entered Kyoto upon imperial command and resided deep within the palace, consulting with Makino, Kiyoura, Yuasa, and others on the aftermath of the February 26th Incident. The results of their deliberations were nothing more than two points: first, "discipline the military" to maintain the national will; second, "international coordination" to appease the concerns of the financial circles. Such deep contemplation and long-term planning lead us to admire their appropriate handling of the situation. However, since the "September 18th Incident," the "Imperial Army" has been invariably victorious. The name "international coordination" is not only deeply resented by the military but even those who call themselves "graduates of Tsinghua," such as Konoe Fumimaro, cover their ears and turn away, respectfully declining the important task. Hirota Koki, a mere scholar relying on the demeanor of a diplomat, maneuvered between the financial circles and senior statesmen, suddenly gaining favor and rising to form a cabinet. The difficulties he faces are the opposite of those faced by Konoe, lying not in how to coordinate diplomacy but in whether the Miyakezaka can be persuaded to agree. Since the establishment of the "Cabinet Formation Headquarters," for several days now, he has been going back and forth, solely reliant on the military's breathing. This situation is truly unprecedented in the history of cabinet formation in Japan.</p>
<p>Nonaka Shiro and others, venting momentary anger, raised troops at the palace gates, alarming the Emperor and startling the people. The price they paid was merely the removal of Araki, Masaki, whom they most admired in life, and Abe of the "Ugaki faction," as well as Hayashi Senjuro, the leader of the "Ishikawa faction." However, Uetda Kenkichi and others of the Central faction reaped the benefits, rising prominently and uniting with the "Araki faction" that had not yet retreated from the Ministry of the Army. They forced Terauchi Hisaichi of the "Ugaki faction" to wield the weapon of the "Military Minister Ordinance" to engage in a fierce struggle with the representatives of the elder statesmen and senior ministers. Although this is not yet sufficient to overthrow Saionji's predetermined policy in one fell swoop, the initial blow was forceful and demanding. Hirota Koki, even with training from the Kokuryukai's Mitsuru Toyama, is likely to be frightened as a result.</p>
<p>This kind of legitimate tactic not only makes any cabinet appear to be difficult to produce but also foreshadows a future collapse. Today's Japan is nominally in a "state of emergency." The military demands the utmost exclusion of party members from serving as state ministers. Although the political parties have no choice but to temporarily accept this, with the leading Minseito party only gaining two seats under the "beautiful name of national unity," the power of the political parties still lies in the parliament. It is assessed that this will ultimately force Machida Chuji, the president of the party who holds the power to decide the budget, to rise up and overthrow the cabinet. Hirota, no matter how skilled, will likely become exhausted. This is the first reason. The army is demanding that Hirota pay an equal price for the "significant sacrifice of four generals retiring to the reserves." If this price involves diplomatic reversals of "international coordination" or financial abandonment of the policies of the late Finance Minister Takahashi, then Hirota will lose favor with the elder statesmen, senior ministers, and financial circles, and will find it difficult to stay in power for long. This is the second reason. This sudden upheaval occurred at the Emperor's side and was only quelled after several days, which is unprecedented in over a hundred years. The "disciplining of the military" by the elder statesmen and senior ministers can represent the demands of the national people. If Hirota cannot fully implement this or does so unsuccessfully, then successors to Nonaka Shiro will emerge in large numbers. This is the third reason. With these three points, the future political turmoil in Japan will likely resemble a raging wave that is impossible to approach. Can Hirota's "Japan Maru" avoid dangerous reefs as it pushes forward through the waves?</p>
<h3>Hirota Accommodates Military Demands - New Japanese Cabinet Formed - Inauguration Ceremony Held Yesterday Afternoon - Seeking Thorough Strengthening of National Defense - Actively Advancing Mainland Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Hirota entered the palace at 7:00 PM to submit the list of new cabinet members, which was approved by the Emperor. The appointment ceremony for each member was held at 8:30 PM, and the new cabinet was officially established. (Ninth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo - It is reported that Hirota has reached a compromise with the military on the selection of new cabinet members. Hirota will concurrently hold the position of Foreign Minister, Baba will serve as Finance Minister, and Raemo will serve as Minister of Commerce. (Ninth Dispatch from Reuters) A meeting was held at 9:15 this morning to discuss the military's demands, chaired by Hirota, with Terauchi, Nagano, and others in attendance. The differences of opinion arising from the military's demands are: 1. Hirota must formulate policies acceptable to the military, after which the military can recognize his cabinet. 2. The political parties must admit that they bear some responsibility for the February 26th Incident, because they only selected one member each from the Minseito and Seiyukai parties to join the cabinet. 3. Hirota has agreed that each party will occupy two positions in the new cabinet. 4. Hirota must formulate a national defense budget that is numerically acceptable to the military. Regarding this, Nagano firmly stated that naval expenditures may be greatly expanded, and asked for Hirota's approval. The meeting had not adjourned as of 12:30 PM. (Ninth Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Generals Terauchi and Nagano continued to meet with the leaders of the new cabinet at the Cabinet Formation Headquarters at 9:00 AM on the 9th. As a result of the negotiations, both sides reached a consensus, and the list of cabinet members has almost been finalized. Furthermore, a total of four members from political parties are participating in the cabinet, with each of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties sending two members. (Ninth Dispatch from Domei)</p>

<h3>Hirota Kōki Clarifies Cabinet Formation Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The cabinet formation headquarters, around 12 o'clock on the evening of the 8th, in the form of a statement by Premier Hirota, clarified its cabinet formation policy. The statement read: "The current domestic and international situation demands a new approach to past administrations. In order to adjust international relations, it is necessary to overcome the current extraordinary situation. We deeply feel that the cause of the current ominous events lies herein and are determined to implement a major reform. All political parties, the military, and bureaucrats should unite as a nation to eliminate long-standing abuses and establish a firm national policy. In selecting cabinet members, we will not be bound by past positions or duties, but will gather individuals who truly understand the current situation and possess a sincere dedication to serve the country to the death. After the government is formed, we will unite and strive to implement policies, upholding the Emperor's will and meeting the people's expectations, in order to cope with the severe situation," etc. (9th, Dōmei News)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Generals Terauchi and Nagano, on the afternoon of the 8th at the cabinet formation headquarters, held negotiations regarding important issues of the current situation, focusing on the military's written opinion. The content was generally as follows: First, General Terauchi stated that all levels of the army deeply regret the grave responsibility for the current incident and are determined to renew their past policies to deal with the situation. Due to the army's responsibility, the five generals have been placed on the reserve list, a very significant sacrifice. The cause of the current incident lies, in part, with the political parties and the people. Therefore, when political parties form a united cabinet, they should accept some sacrifices and not insist on a fixed number of cabinet seats. Each of the Seiyūkai and Minseitō should be limited to one cabinet member. It seems that the current Hirota cabinet lacks the ambition to resolve abuses, reform diplomacy, and innovate other general affairs. Hirota should immediately clarify the cabinet's policy to dispel misunderstandings and aim to truly renew the cabinet. The world believes that the army is establishing a fascist regime, but the army authorities have absolutely no such plan. This is hereby declared. General Nagano, who was present, also expressed the same opinion. As a result of discussions among those present, it was decided to immediately issue a statement clarifying the cabinet formation policy. (9th, Dōmei News)</p>
<h3>Military's Conditions for Joining the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Generals Terauchi and Nagano, when meeting with Premier Hirota and others this morning, explained the army's national policy plans and related funding issues. Hirota and other leaders agreed to sincerely implement the army's national policy after the cabinet is formed. (9th, Dōmei News)</p>
<p>Tokyo – All the items of the conditions for joining the cabinet proposed by General Terauchi have been readily accepted by Foreign Minister Hirota during meetings yesterday and today. Therefore, the cabinet formation work has also overcome obstacles and is proceeding rapidly. Among the four major items proposed by General Terauchi, the thorough strengthening of national defense is a massive six-year plan worth 2 billion yen. The current total army budget is 500 million yen, but if this plan is realized by the Hirota cabinet, the army budget will immediately exceed 800 million yen and expand significantly. The focus of imperial defense is truly on the northern Manchurian border; therefore, securing national defense in this area can be considerably expected. (9th, Den-tsū News)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to the statement released on the 9th by Foreign Minister Hirota, relations with the military seem to be trending towards improvement. However, General Terauchi's second point is that the four major items from the previous telegram are conditions for joining the cabinet and will be implemented definitively. Because of the huge expenditures required for thorough strengthening of national defense in its broad sense and for the implementation of national policy with a focus on promoting a positive continental policy, future developments are being closely watched by all quarters. (9th, Den-tsū News)</p>
<h3>First Meeting of the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The first cabinet meeting of the Hirota cabinet is scheduled to be held at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9 p.m. on the 9th. Premier Hirota hopes that all cabinet members will attend and will begin with Premier Hirota delivering an address, explaining the intention to work together to overcome the difficult situation and move forward. It was also decided to appoint Shōhei Fujinuma as Chief Cabinet Secretary and Daisaburō Kida as Director-General of the Legislation Bureau. (9th, Dōmei News)</p>
<h3>Two Major Political Parties Support the Government</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Upon the formation of the Hirota cabinet, the Seiyūkai stated its position as follows: "After the outbreak of an unprecedented ominous incident, the people of the whole country are worried about the future of the situation. At this time, the establishment of the cabinet is truly a matter of great celebration for the country. Regarding this point, the efforts of the new Premier Hirota and the members of the cabinet formation are truly commendable. Although there may be some differences of opinion regarding the procedures of cabinet formation, since Maeda and Shimada have joined the cabinet to assist, we must abandon minor differences and seek common ground in order to unite as a nation to deal with the extraordinary situation." (9th, Dōmei News)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Now that the Hirota cabinet has been established, the Minseitō, through Secretary-General Ōasa, expressed its position in a statement as follows: "The Hirota cabinet, which was temporarily rumored to be a difficult birth, has now been safely established, which is a matter of great rejoicing for the nation. The new cabinet should directly face the current domestic and international situation of our country and carry out major reforms with the cooperation of the whole nation. At the same time, all parties should not be bound by their past positions, but should truly be humble and self-respecting, and overcome national difficulties with sincere awareness, contributing to the expansion of a leaping Japan." (9th, Dōmei News)</p>
<h3>Ōkaku Appointed Military Councillor</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Emperor approved the resignation of Navy Minister Ōkaku on the 9th and simultaneously appointed Ōkaku as a military councillor. (6th, Dōmei News)</p>
<h3>Ueda to Take Office in Manchuria at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>Changchun – The new Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Kenkichi Ueda, is currently scheduled to arrive in Changchun on April 1 to take over from General Minami. The former Commander Minami is scheduled to leave Changchun and return to Japan on the 2nd. (9th, Den-tsū News)</p>
<h3>Tokyo and Osaka Stock Exchanges to Open</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which suspended operations after the February 26th Incident, will resume normal operations tomorrow, the 10th, after consultation with the Osaka Stock Exchange, now that the Hirota cabinet has been established. (9th, Den-tsū News)</p>
<h3>Scientist Discovers Deadly Radiation: 16 Times Stronger Than X-Rays; Extremely Valuable for Military Purposes</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Dr. Kreuger of the research institute at the University of Illinois in the United States has discovered a new deadly radiation, which has been announced by the university. This radiation, similar to cathode ray X-rays, is said to be invisible to the naked eye and can kill from a distance of 50 meters. Its intensity is 16 times that of X-rays, and it can drastically reduce white blood cells in the blood by 80 to 20 percent. Although not immediately fatal, it causes gradual death. Like X-rays, it can penetrate opaque objects and kill the drivers of tanks. If the radiation emitter is hidden underground, the surrounding area can be completely cleared of people, making it extremely valuable for military purposes. (9th, China United Press)</p>

<h3>British Government Reaffirms Respect for Locarno Obligations: Willing to Thoroughly Study German Proposals to Rebuild the Foundation of European Peace; France Accuses Germany of Violating the Treaty Before the League of Nations</h3>
<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Eden today explained in the House of Commons the British attitude towards Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty and the entry of troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. He said that he had told the German ambassador to the UK that Germany's entry into the Rhineland was equivalent to the unilateral abolition of a treaty freely negotiated and freely signed, and that the reaction to this action in the UK would be very serious. Germany's actions have made the international situation more complicated and have shaken the credibility of any treaties that the German government may sign in the future. British authorities do not want to excuse the solemnity of treaties and principles that depend on the entire international relations, but he believes that there is no reason to say that Germany's move contains a hostile threat. The British government states that as a signatory to the Locarno Treaty, if any attack is added to France or Belgium, which destroys Article 2 of the Locarno Treaty, the British government will have to come out and assist the country being attacked. One of the important foundations of Western European peace has now collapsed. If we want to consolidate peace, our duty is to rebuild this foundation. We are now dealing with Hitler's new proposal in this spirit. The British government is now thoroughly studying Mr. Xi's proposal to find out the extent to which his proposal can consolidate the foundation of peace. The British government feels that any opportunity for improvement should not be missed. He asked the French public for support for the government to handle this difficult matter. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Full Text of the French Application Paris - Regarding Germany's abolition of the Locarno Treaty, the government recently submitted an application to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Aiwen, in the evening, and conveyed it to the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Bruce, the Australian representative. The entire application is only one page and is typed. The content first states that Germany's dispatch of troops into the demilitarized zone along the Rhine River is a violation of Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles (ie, the provisions on the demilitarized zone) and Article 1 of the Locarno Treaty (ie, the provisions on respecting the demilitarized zone system). The country's unilateral abolition of the Locarno Convention is also a violation of the abolition procedure contained in Article 8 of the Treaty. According to the provisions of Article 8, the Locarno Convention should be invalidated by a two-thirds majority decision of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations. As for the entry of German troops into the Rhineland demilitarized zone, although the country's government has provided assurances to the French ambassador that its meaning is "only symbolic," the actual number of troops is large and does not match the statement of symbolism. Now that the situation is urgent, it is necessary to take necessary measures to convene a meeting of the Executive Yuan as soon as possible to discuss this matter. This application was originally intended to be submitted jointly by France and Belgium, but in order to avoid delaying the time, France submitted it alone first, and the original text was sent to the Belgian government.

<h3>Locarno Signatories Gather in Paris Today: British Foreign Secretary and Prime Minister to Attend in Person</h3>
<p>London – The international crisis caused by Hitler's declaration has made this week one of the busiest and most important weeks in the European international political world in many years. This afternoon, after British Foreign Secretary Eden made a speech on the current situation in the House of Commons, he will go to Paris to discuss everything with representatives of the signatories of the Locarno Convention, and then he will discuss with representatives of other countries and go to Geneva to participate in the March 11 meeting of the Thirteen-Nation Committee to consider the reply of Italy and Afghanistan to the new peace proposal of the League of Nations. French Foreign Minister Folantin also intends to attend the meeting and will return to Paris on March 12. On that day, the French-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty will be submitted to the Senate for approval. The next day, he will go to Geneva again to participate in the meeting of the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations to consider Germany's abolition of the treaty. (9th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Brussels – Prime Minister Zilan has left for Paris at 4 p.m. today to prepare to participate in the meeting of the signatories to the Locarno Convention. Prime Minister Zilan originally planned to go to Warsaw in Geneva to answer the invitation of Polish Foreign Minister Burke, but now that he has a trip to Paris, he ordered the Minister to Poland to inform Colonel Burke that he would have to postpone it for a week or two before he could make the trip. (9th, Havas News)</p>
<p>London – British Foreign Secretary Eden told German Ambassador Hezhi yesterday that the United Kingdom has a very serious view of Germany's abolition of the Locarno Convention and the dispatch of troops into the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland. British Ambassador to Berlin, Sir Youngs, also had the same attitude when German Foreign Minister Niulait came to make a statement abolishing the Locarno Convention. Eden spent the whole day yesterday studying the situation at the Foreign Office and consulting with various members. Eden will announce the UK's attitude towards Germany's actions in the House of Commons tomorrow and will attend a meeting in Paris of the signatories to the Locarno Convention other than Germany, which is scheduled for Tuesday. Today, Eden and French Ambassador Corbin discussed the procedures to be taken in Paris and Geneva at the Foreign Office. They talked twice, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. It is heard that the talks focused on the procedures to be taken in Geneva and Paris next week due to Germany's actions. No movement was seen at the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street today until 4 p.m., when a small number of people gathered in front of the residence to watch Prime Minister Baoerwen return by car from Chikes. Then a security car followed. The Prime Minister then invited Eden to discuss the overall situation. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>London – Italy's expression of sympathy to France over the crisis of the Locarno Treaty has made the UK's attitude towards Germany tougher. Foreign Secretary Eden intends to ask German leader Hitler to withdraw the German troops that have entered the Rhineland, while the French army has also heard of large-scale movements, which the UK attaches great importance to. It is reported that Eden once told a friend that if Germany's abandonment of the Locarno Treaty cannot be dealt with in a firm manner, the UK will have to abandon the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy. After repeated consultations, the cabinet has learned that Eden and Prime Minister Baoerwen's attitude is tougher than initially expected. It is expected that Eden's declaration in the House of Commons tomorrow before going to France will be strongly worded. It is reliable that he will absolutely denounce Germany's unilateral violation of the treaty, but will solemnly declare that the final response is the responsibility of the League of Nations. It is said that if France does not get the UK's consent to impose sanctions on Germany, Foreign Minister Folantin may directly ask the League of Nations to implement them, but UK observers do not believe that this move can be effective because it is difficult to impose sanctions on two major powers at the same time. It is also difficult to implement sanctions against two major powers at the same time, and economic sanctions are easy to trigger military action, which is also well known to the leaders of the alliance. The External Affairs Authority announced today that the foreign ministers and ambassadors of the four countries, Britain, France, Italy, and Belgium, will meet in Paris on Tuesday to discuss the attitude that the League of Nations should take and draft a joint protest against Germany. It is reported that the meeting will also consider negotiating a security treaty with Germany based on Hitler's proposal. (8th, National News)</p>
<h3>France Pours All Its Efforts into Resisting Germany: Diplomatic and Military Measures Are Taken Simultaneously; Folantin Meets with Ambassadors from the UK, Italy, and the US; Trenches and Fortifications Are Deepened on the Eastern Border, and Troops Are Busily Being Deployed</h3>
<p>Paris – In the French diplomatic world, various expressions have been received today that all friendly countries will help France force Germany to respect the Locarno Treaty. Neutral observers say that France has become a "war maniac," and is using the power of the whole country to promote the actions of resisting Hitler's abandonment of the Locarno Convention and stationing troops in the Rhineland on both the diplomatic and military fronts. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has ordered Italian Ambassador to France Seruti to assure Foreign Minister Folantin that Italy is in complete sympathy with France on Germany's actions. It is reliable that Mussolini's assurance has been confirmed, and it is stated that if there is a war, Italy is prepared to give France military assistance. Later, the UK also expressed a tough attitude, and French Prime Minister Salo announced that he will explain the crisis in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, but refused to answer questions from members of parliament. Army Chief Marren told the Associated Press today that the French army's deployments are currently limited to the border area, but all the forts in all locations have been fully manned. A spokesman for the department also said that France has quickly deployed troops in the newly completed 16th and 20th defensive areas, and the troops miles behind have been advancing according to plan. Military activities can be seen all over the country. The guards at Kir Bridge have doubled, and engineering teams are busy laying special telephone lines along the border. At the same time, the ambassadors of the UK, US, and Italy to France have all spoken to Foreign Minister Folantin separately. (8th, National News)</p>
<p>Paris – Foreign Minister Folantin received Italian Ambassador Seruti at 4:30 p.m. today, and the conversation lasted 45 minutes. Later, he held talks with US Ambassador Stolloshi. Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Réri also met with British Ambassador Sir Clerke at noon. It is generally known that Folantin and Réri separately informed the ambassadors of Italy and the UK about the contents of the application submitted by France to the League of Nations.

<p>Several regiments of troops stationed in Metz and Chiong City, France, which were originally part of the border guard, have been marching to the border to garrison defensive fortifications since last night, but the residents of the border area can remain calm. In addition, according to news from Salrotaihen City, Germany, a battalion of officers and soldiers from the 17th Regiment of the German National Defense Force have arrived there.

<h3>French Prime Minister's Broadcast Address: Denounces German Actions: Disregards Treaties and Endangers Peace: Urges the People to Unite Against Foreign Enemies</h3>
<p>Paris – Prime Minister Salo delivered a broadcast address at 7:30 p.m., severely criticizing Germany's unilateral abandonment of the treaty and refusing to consider Germany's proposals. He said, "The French government will never make concessions under threat. Germany has now disregarded its solemn obligations and stationed troops on the Rhine River. Know that if there is a German soldier on the Rhine River, this alone is enough to prevent negotiations from taking place. I cannot consider the proposals put forward by German leader Hitler, for two reasons: Germany's unilateral abolition of the treaty has now been seen again (Germany abolished the military provisions of the Treaty of Versailles in March last year, which was the first time), and it is difficult to trust new proposals. Re-fortifying the Rhine River is not done by violent means, but puts France in a fait accompli. If Germany's actions become a trend, other countries will follow suit, and European peace will no longer be possible, and so-called international relations will no longer exist. After careful consideration of the current situation, I dare to announce to the people in the name of the French government that the Locarno Convention is a bastion to protect the security of France and Belgium. We must maintain it. Strasbourg (the capital of Alsace), we will never allow it to be under German artillery fire. The claims we hold are both fair and powerful, and European peace depends on it. We are confident that defending this claim is to defend the destiny of France. The French people should now abandon all internal strife and be of one mind to support the government's actions. The German government can be said to have made good use of the opportunity to commit this outrage. It did not do what it wanted when our National Assembly passed the ratification of the French-Russian Mutual Assistance Treaty, but it took this action at the start of our National Assembly re-election campaign. Its intention is nothing more than to think that our political parties, whenever there is an election, often cause domestic disputes and disturbances due to differences in party views. The German government believes that this opportunity is worth taking advantage of, so the real reason why it took this decision by lightning speed is that I am going to engage in wall-gazing disputes. It is also known that in our country's history, whenever the country is in danger, all divergent party views can be immediately eliminated, and any political party will unite its aspirations in order to maintain national independence and protect national security. The German government had previously neglected this (referring to World War I), and is now repeating the same mistake. Someone on the other side of the Rhine River (referring to Germany) believes that some of our compatriots may be able to forgive Germany's actions in abolishing the treaty. To say this is close to insult. None of our people will abandon themselves and be hit by this statement. In short, no matter who forgets to use France's internal divisions to achieve its goals, it will only see its efforts fail. The French people are now prepared to show the world the evidence of their unity in any situation. German leader Schickler, in a fierce and excited tone in the House of Representatives yesterday, disregarded the obligations freely agreed upon and declared the abolition of the Locarno Convention and violated the system of the demilitarized zone of the Rhine River stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. The reasons he held were insufficient, and the impact was extremely serious. In this situation, we, the French people, and international public opinion, should take a calm and prudent step in response to Germany with an attitude of loyalty and adherence to the treaty." Salo went on to elaborate on the relationship between France and Germany after the European War, saying that the demilitarized zone system of the Rhine River and the Locarno Convention were a barrier to France's security. "Since the establishment of the Locarno Convention, a new era in the relationship between France and Germany began. Since then, French troops have gradually withdrawn from the Rhine River region, and France is keen to improve its relationship with Germany. This move is clear proof." Prime Minister Salo finally recounted that during the European War, the northern provinces of France were devastated, and after the conclusion of the peace treaty, Germany broke its promise and failed to pay the reparations. "The French have gradually forgotten the past events of the European War, and the French soldiers who participated in the war are also generous and willing to put aside their past grievances and join hands with the German soldiers who participated in the war. It is a pity that Germany's actions cannot promote the mutual approach between France and Germany." (7th, Havas News)</p>
<h3>45,000 German Troops Enter the Demilitarized Rhineland, Millions of Citizens Cheer Enthusiastically as if Mad, French Troops Increase Defenses Across the River, Situation Tense</h3>
<p>The armies of Germany and France in the city of Frankfurt are now within pistol range of each other. Meanwhile, German soldiers in gray uniforms continue to advance into the Rhineland area, receiving fervent welcomes from the populace. A military spirit pervades everywhere today. Two battalions from the 19th Artillery Regiment marched through the streets with great strides, cheered by millions of citizens, some of whom wept with joy. Anti-aircraft guns have been set up at the Rebstock airfield near here. Residents of Bonn broke through the barriers of the stormtroopers and hung garlands around the soldiers' necks.

<p>According to reliable sources here, Prime Minister Mussolini has assured France that if war breaks out over the Locarno Pact issue, Italy is prepared to assist France against Germany. It is now known that this assistance even includes military support. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today, after hearing the news that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is willing to use military force to assist France in resolving the Locarno Pact issue, the situation in Germany suddenly became tense. However, officials claim that this expression by the Italian Prime Minister is merely an attempt to reduce resistance to his invasion of East Africa. Officials refused to comment on the news of the formation of an anti-German front, but observers with good connections believe that Germany will definitely not accept the condition put forward by France that Germany withdraw from the Rhineland as a prerequisite for Franco-German negotiations.

<p>Geneva: The Committee of Thirteen of the League of Nations Council previously proposed that Italy and Abyssinia conduct peace negotiations based on the League of Nations Covenant, seeking the opinions of both countries. The Italian government recently sent a reply to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating, "The Italian government has read the proposal put forward by the Committee of Thirteen of the Council and hereby agrees in principle to begin negotiations with Abyssinia in order to resolve the dispute between the two countries." The Italian reply was concise, and many League of Nations officials considered this to be [redacted due to damage]. (Havas Telegram, 8th) Asmara: After receiving news that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini had accepted the Committee of Thirteen's proposal for peace talks, the Italian authorities in Asmara ordered bombers to fly back to their bases from the interior and issued a wireless telegram instructing them to cease aerial bombardment pending peace discussions in Europe. (Reuters Telegram, 9th) A message from Asmara states that the report that General Badoglio, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, has ordered a cessation of artillery bombardment and infantry battles is inaccurate. Although officials claim that several aircraft have been ordered to return to their bases, this is not a sign that the Italian forces have ceased their offensive. The Italian forces are still advancing in East Africa as before.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Comments, Russia's Military Ambition, Attack on the Rhineland is a First Attempt, Crisis of European War Lurks</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Russian military newspaper "Red Star" published an article today stating that Germany's attack on the Rhineland is another manifestation of aggression. The recklessness of this action is unprecedented. Hitler has repeatedly stated that he must have Soviet Russian territory, and now he might as well try his hand. Soviet Russian journalist Radek published an article in Pravda today, also stating that if Western Europe had a concrete plan to curb Hitler's ambitions, he would not have dared to act so rashly. If things are allowed to drift along and are handled ambiguously, the outbreak of war will be unavoidable. (National Agency Telegram, 8th)</p>

This shows that Germany does intend to contact Lithuania. According to reliable sources, the German government is conducting negotiations with Lithuania in order to adjust relations between the two countries and bring them back on track. The first step is said to be to persuade the newspapers of both countries to comment on issues related to the two countries with an objective attitude, a calm mind, and an accurate eye, so as to dispel misunderstandings and correct public opinion.

<h3>Geography Lecture, Why Should We Learn Foreign Geography (Continued from March 1st)</h3>
<p>— Professor Huang Guozhang, Department of Geography, National Central University</p>
<p>A third reason for studying foreign geography is that we can use the methods by which various countries adapt to their environments as a lesson for improving our own national economy and people's livelihood. Furthermore, the ways in which various countries around the world utilize their land can serve as a reference for improving our own land utilization methods. Improving our country's land utilization requires starting in two aspects: first, studying the conditions of our own country's land and its current utilization methods, which is a major purpose of our studying domestic geography; second, referring to foreign methods of land utilization to improve our own land utilization, which is what I am going to talk about now.</p>
<p>Why can we refer to and adopt foreign land utilization methods? This can be explained from two aspects:—</p>
<p>Land utilization methods vary from place to place – this can be explained by three points:</p>
<p>(1) Land utilization is closely related to the combination of natural environmental factors – the so-called natural environment is composed of various factors such as climate, topography, water systems, soil, mineral resources, natural vegetation, organisms, and their positional relationships with other places. There are no two places on Earth with exactly the same combination of natural environmental factors, but there are many similarities within the differences. Therefore, there are also many similarities in land utilization. For example, the rice-growing areas in China have many aspects that are exactly the same as the rice-growing areas in Annam, Siam, Japan, Korea, India, and Java. The United States, Canada, Argentina, Russia, and Australia are all wheat-producing regions with large exports, and they have many identical points in their land utilization methods. Furthermore, industrial areas such as those in eastern North America and western Europe have very little difference in land utilization.</p>
<p>In most places, land utilization is not limited to one method. Several different methods can be adopted on the same piece of land, and all can achieve reasonably good results. However, the methods adopted must have certain natural limitations. If the methods adopted are not suitable for the nature of the land, the result will still be failure. For example, the plains area of ​​the three northeastern provinces, although wheat, sorghum, millet, corn, and soybeans can be grown, and it can also be used for animal husbandry, it is not necessarily limited to one type of crop, but there are also certain limits. Not just any type can be grown. If rice and cotton are grown, there is little hope of success. In places with purely different natural environments, land utilization methods are also purely different. For example, in northwestern China, most of the land is sandy desert and semi-desert, with very little arable land. People live by nomadic herding, moving with the water and grass. There are few roads and sparse villages, all of which indicate a sparse population and a difficult livelihood. In the southeastern agricultural area, arable land covers the fields, roads are densely distributed, rural areas are everywhere, and cities are also very developed, all of which indicate a large population and vigorous vitality. Compared with most of the northwest, it is like two different worlds. Even within the southeastern agricultural area, the northeast is very different. The scenes in the cotton, wheat, and coarse grain area in the north and the rice, silk, and tea area in the south are clearly different, while the southwestern plateau area is very different from the northwest, and also has many differences from the southeast. Within the same country, land utilization methods are so inconsistent, so the disparity between countries is even more conceivable.</p>
<p>(2) Land utilization methods are related to the size and quality of the local population – suppose there are two places that can both develop agriculture, one with a sparse population and one with a dense population. In the sparsely populated area, it is more suitable to develop animal husbandry using its natural grassland than to develop agriculture. As for the densely populated area, of course, the development of agriculture is the priority. The rice-growing area along the Gulf of Mexico in the southern United States has a natural environment that is roughly similar to that of the Yangtze River basin in China. However, because the United States has few people and China has many people, one uses machines and the other uses manual labor, and their farming methods are completely different.</p>
<p>In addition to the number of people, the quality of the residents is also closely related to land utilization. The degree of technical knowledge that residents should have for various human occupations can make land utilization methods in two places with similar natural environments drastically different. For example, the residents of the desert and semi-desert areas in northwestern China move with the water and grass, and the products they produce are only enough to meet local needs; while the residents living in the desert and semi-desert areas in western United States and Australia adopt large-scale animal husbandry methods, using their products to supply the needs of the whole world, so that the living conditions of the people are very different from those in the northwestern region of China. In addition, the diligence and laziness of the residents, the level of living, social customs, and the quality of political organization all have a considerable impact on land utilization methods.</p>
<p>(3) Land utilization is related to a place's external relations – such as foreign trade, the types and lengths of transportation routes, foreign transportation equipment, financial and management institutions required for foreign trade, such as banks and import and export trading companies, as well as the size of government protection capabilities, such as the existence of unequal treaties, and whether protective tariffs can be implemented, all of which are sufficient to form the different characteristics of land utilization methods in various places.</p>
<p>Land utilization methods in various places are constantly changing – in very few places on Earth can people's land utilization methods remain unchanged for a considerable period of time. In places affected by Western material culture, land utilization methods can be said to change from generation to generation, or even from year to year. The original land utilization methods are closely related to the local natural environment, the size and quality of the residents, and external relations, and these are not fixed and can change at any time. In order to cope with the new environment, land utilization methods must change accordingly. Currently, our government is actively planning to use scientific methods to promote national economic construction, such as building railways, repairing highways, establishing steel plants, establishing air routes, improving crop seeds, improving livestock breeds, unifying currency, etc. These can make the environment in various provinces and regions change day by day. In order to adapt to these new changes, land utilization methods must also be improved from time to time. For example, the residents of southern Hunan do not currently have a railway going south to Guangzhou, and rely entirely on human, animal, and water power for transportation, so many rich resources above and below the land, such as forests and iron deposits, are difficult to develop due to inconvenient transportation. After the Changsha-Guangdong Railway is completed this October, although only a man-made route will be added to the environment of the residents of southern Hunan, the methods of land utilization by the residents must undergo many changes invisibly due to this route.</p>
<p>European countries are the initiators of scientific civilization, and many of their land utilization methods can be used as a reference for our country, especially those places whose environment is roughly the same as ours, which are even more worthy of our emulation. For example, the natural background of northeastern United States and northwestern Europe is the same as the Bohai Sea region in our country (including the Liao River basin in Northeast China and the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, and Shandong), which is a coal and iron-producing region with convenient transportation. Since European and American countries have been able to develop industries in these places, making them the heavy industrial center of the most important North Atlantic coastal region in the world, why can't our country use the Bohai Sea coast to create a heavy industrial center in the North Pacific region? If we had done this earlier, we would not have aroused the covetousness of other countries today. Not only can our country refer to the land utilization methods of other countries in the world, but other countries are also referring to each other. Now I will give three examples to illustrate this:</p>
<p>The methods currently used by Russia to develop Central Asia are the same as the methods used by Egypt to develop the lower Nile River, because both places are deserts, the sunshine and heat are very strong during the growing season, there are no drastic changes in air temperature, and there is convenient river water conservancy to supply irrigation needs. Egyptians can use the lower Nile River to grow cotton and become a famous cotton-producing area in the world, so Russians can of course use the same method to develop the land in Central Asia. After several years of efforts, the Russians have actually achieved great success. Many places in Ningxia, Gansu, and Xinjiang in northwestern China have not much different natural conditions from Central Asia. As long as we can build a railway from the interior to these places and improve their water conservancy to facilitate irrigation, I think we can definitely develop many good cotton fields and orchards to supply part of our needs. The cotton in Turpan, Xinjiang, is known for its excellent quality, and many parcels are mailed to Tianjin every year, which is enough to prove that the cotton planting industry in the northwest has great potential for development.</p>
<p>In the past, all the rubber used in the world was produced by Brazil in South America. Later, the uses of rubber expanded day by day, and the international demand increased day by day. Britain was unwilling to be controlled by Brazil and wanted to find places within its own territory that could produce rubber. As a result, it discovered that the natural environment of the Malay Peninsula was very similar to that of the Amazon River basin in Brazil. Therefore, it sowed Brazilian rubber seeds in the greenhouses of the London Botanical Garden, and then sent the rubber seedlings to the Malay Peninsula for cultivation. The result was very satisfactory. Later, the rubber industry spread from the Malay Peninsula to the Dutch East Indies, and now the Malay and Dutch East Indies have long become the world's main rubber-producing areas. Hainan Island in our country has a low-latitude climate and natural conditions very similar to those of Malay and Dutch East Indies. As long as it is used properly, it will definitely be possible to develop the rubber industry.</p>
<p>The natural conditions of the western United States and the northwestern part of our country are also very similar, and they are both pastoral areas. The US government specially sent the Roelich father and son to Inner Mongolia in the summer of last year to collect drought-resistant plant seeds to bring back for trial planting in order to improve the pastures on the western Great Plains.</p>
<p>The examples given above seem to focus on agriculture; in fact, it is necessary to refer to foreign countries for the development of various industries, and knowledge of foreign geography can be applied everywhere. To develop the manufacturing industry, it is necessary to understand the domestic situation, but at the same time, it is also necessary to understand the foreign situation. The raw materials and fuels required by the manufacturing industry are often not all supplied by the country and must be obtained from foreign countries. The nature and center of the manufacturing industry often depend on the supply situation of domestic and foreign raw materials and fuels. The same is true for the development of commerce. The commodity market is not necessarily limited to the country. The distance of foreign markets, the competition situation in various countries, and the external transportation routes are all sufficient for us to determine the nature and center of commerce, and this knowledge cannot be learned without studying foreign geography.</p>
<p>Finally, I will repeat and summarize again, we have three main reasons for studying foreign geography: first, we can understand the interrelationships between countries; second, we can understand the position of our country in the international community; third, we can use it as a lesson for improving the national economy and people's livelihood.

<h3>Shanxi Province Implements Severing of Transportation to Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Shanxi troops are distributing proclamations to Communist Party members. Extensive communications and military deployments to suppress bandits by the Shanxi army are complete. Searches and suppressions are underway everywhere. The Shanxi Western armies, after recovering Sanquan Town in Fenyang County, are in high spirits and are advancing towards Zhongyang. Fierce battles are also ongoing in the Xi County area. Zhang Fufu, Deputy Director of the Central Training Directorate, Hou Cheng, Director of the Education Department of the General Staff Headquarters, and Gong Jicheng, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ordnance Bureau of the Ministry of Military Affairs, arrived in Taiyuan from Nanjing the day before yesterday to visit the local authorities and inspect the latest actual situation in the bandit areas of Shanxi Province. They have been in daily consultation with local authorities and have telegraphed reports to the Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. The Shanxi Provincial Government yesterday specifically stipulated measures to sever transportation to the bandit areas and ordered their immediate implementation. All Shanxi military commanders have issued proclamations to Communist soldiers, stipulating surrender procedures. The original texts of these measures are appended below:</p>
<p>Thirteen Articles of Measures for Shanxi Province to Investigate and Prohibit the Entry of Communist Party Members, Ordered to be Implemented by All Counties. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>All border counties should designate a number of entry points on the border with neighboring provinces, assign personnel to set up checkpoints, and investigate pedestrians entering from other provinces. All other entry points are to be completely sealed off and not allowed to be used.</p>
<p>All pedestrians entering from other provinces must first apply to the county government or municipal public security bureau of their place of origin or place of employment for a permit to enter Shanxi or return to their hometown. The permit should state the reason for entry, prove that the person is not suspected of being a Communist Party member, and bear the person's photograph. The permit is to be presented to the checkpoint personnel for inspection, stamped, and then the person is allowed to pass. However, permits issued by the county governments or municipal public security bureaus in bandit areas are invalid.</p>
<p>When people from Shanxi Province return to the province, if they do not hold the permit mentioned in the previous article, they must obtain reliable proof according to the following regulations before they are allowed to enter: (A) Those serving in government offices must hold a passport or certificate from their employing agency; (B) Students must hold a certificate from the school they are attending or the head of their hometown street or village; (C) Merchants must hold a certificate from the chamber of commerce in their place of business or the head of their hometown street or village; (D) All other persons must hold a certificate from the head of their hometown street or village.</p>
<p>Anyone who does not hold the permit or certificate mentioned in the preceding two articles shall be prohibited from entering.</p>
<p>After entering the country with an entry permit or certificate, pedestrians traveling in counties implementing special passes should present their permits or certificates for verification and obtain a special pass.</p>
<p>If any engineering project in this province needs to recruit workers from other provinces, it should apply to the local government for a recruitment permit, recruit sufficient workers, and enter the country. The checkpoint inspection personnel at the border will check the number of people against the permit, stamp it, and allow them to pass. The permit will be verified and released along the way. After returning, the permit will be turned in and a list of workers will be prepared and reported for record.</p>
<p>All workers recruited in the preceding article must find a reliable guarantor to prove that they are not suspected of being Communist Party members. If any Communist Party members are mixed in, the recruiter shall be subject to joint and several punishment. After the workers are dismissed, the original employer should send them out of the province and report to the local government for record.</p>
<p>If any border county fails to thoroughly investigate and allow Communist Party members to sneak into the interior, the investigating county should inquire about the entry point and report it to the two provincial governments for verification. After verification, the county magistrate of the entering county and the responsible personnel under his jurisdiction shall be severely punished.</p>
<p>Any person or Bao Wei Tuan member who knows of Communist Party members sneaking into the country and reports them and they are apprehended shall be given a reward of one hundred yuan. The investigating government office shall strictly maintain the confidentiality of the aforementioned reporter.</p>
<p>Any border inspection personnel who take bribes to allow people to enter the country or extort and obstruct them shall be severely punished according to law.</p>
<p>The expenses required for each county to handle the investigation and prohibition of Communist Party members entering the country shall be reported for proper expenditure.</p>
<p>The inspection of pedestrians entering the country by large vehicles shall be handled jointly by personnel dispatched by the two provincial governments.</p>
<p>These measures shall be implemented from the date of issue. Fellow compatriots, the time has come for you to break away from the oppression of the Communist bandit leaders. What suffering is your life now? You are starving, you are freezing, you have no medicine for your injuries and illnesses, you walk barefoot, and you are forced by the bandit leaders every day to go against your conscience, burn villages, and kill people.</p>
<p>If you follow them to the end, you will still not avoid death. Can you endure this inhuman life? As for communism, your policy in the red area is only to concentrate land and food in the hands of a small number of bandit leaders. You will not get much of it. How can it be like the system of distribution according to labor advocated by Director Yan, where whoever works gets the fruits of their labor? This is fair. Your current actions can only destroy society and hinder evolution. What is the point? Speaking of life, we now eat white flour and wear warm clothes. You are starving and freezing, and you are about to starve to death. Why? Think carefully. Speaking of strength, we have cannons, machine guns, grenades, and the automatic help of the people. You are empty-handed and only fill the bandit leaders' eyes. You can only arouse hatred among the people. Why send yourself to death like this? Now you are violating the needs of the nation and deviating from the correct path of the Three Principles of the People. Your future will ultimately be annihilation. You are all citizens of the Republic of China. We forgive you very much. It is not worth it for you to die for the bandit leaders. Now is the time to defect. Wake up quickly and don't wait to die. We are giving the following to all of you:</p>
<p>Those who come over with a rifle will be rewarded with thirty yuan. Those who come over with a light machine gun will be rewarded with fifty yuan. Those who come over with a mortar will be rewarded with one hundred yuan. Those who come over with a heavy machine gun will be rewarded with five hundred yuan. Those who come over with a radio will be rewarded with one thousand yuan. Those who come over with other military equipment will also be generously rewarded.</p>
<p>Soldiers who come over and wish to serve in the military will be allowed to do so. Otherwise, we will provide travel expenses to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Officials of all levels who come over and wish to work will be given preferential employment. Otherwise, we will provide travel expenses to return to their hometowns. Signed, All Officers and Men of the Jin-Sui Army (Issued March 6th)</p>
<h3>Dagukou's Ice Melts, Shipping Resumes</h3>
<p>Shipping Merchants' Direct Losses Near Three Million; Tianjin Shipping Industry Cables Ministry Requesting Exemption from Tonnage Dues Tianjin Correspondence: The ice outside Dagukou has gradually melted and flowed out to sea due to the recent warmer weather and dramatic tides. Most of the ice near the Dagukou outer forts, Heigu, and the lightship has melted. Only the breakwater and the Dasan River area still have very thin ice, allowing large ships to pass without obstruction. The South and North ports are still mostly frozen due to wind direction and low water levels. As a result, the Dalian Company's Yijin Maru, the Sanbei Company's Sanxing, and the Zhengji Company's Fengli, which are frozen there, are unlikely to move within the next month or two due to the thick ice at the waterline. Fortunately, the ice in that area is like a plain, so the companies can hire workers to transport coal, water, and food to the ships so that the crew members do not starve. Inside Tanggu, the section of Xinhe and Gugu has some ice congestion again because the wind direction changed slightly in the afternoon of the 7th and that section is located at a bend in the river channel. On the 8th, the Changan Wheel, which was sailing from Tanggu, was blocked midway and specially telegraphed the Tianjin Shipping Company to request the Tianxing icebreaker for assistance. As of the 8th, in addition to the Tianjin-Shanghai route being unobstructed outside Dagukou, the routes between Yantai and Tianjin and between Dalian and Tianjin are still difficult to navigate due to the large amount of ice flowing from the Laotieshan area. All ships that were sailing have turned back midway. According to the observation of the shipping industry, it will take at least two weeks to return to normal. Currently, only three ships, Yijin Maru, etc., are trapped in the North and South ports. The rest have all escaped danger. Yesterday, the Yongheng ship arrived in Tianjin. The crew and passengers were trapped outside Dagukou for thirty-nine days. Food and fresh water were exhausted, and they had no choice but to eat the dried and fresh goods carried on the ship and drink snow water. They endured great hardship. After arriving in Tianjin, their hair was long and shaggy, and they were haggard, as if they had lived in another world. From the time the ice sealed Dagukou on January 10th, it lasted for more than fifty days. In February, eight ships entered and seven ships left Dagukou, and transportation was completely suspended. The total output for the entire month was more than 57 million tons, which is several times less than the 180 million tons of various goods exported when it was not blocked by ice. Although there are no statistics on the loss of customs revenue, it is estimated to be around four or five million. The shipping industry estimates that the loss of ships and goods can be roughly divided into (A) direct losses: 1. Loss of ship schedules: Averaging 500 yuan per day for large and small Chinese and foreign ships, the total loss is 1.5 million. 2. Loss of coal: 720,000. 3. Loss of food: 90,000. 4. Loss of boiler water: 20,000. 5. Loss of ship repair costs: 100,000. 6. Loss of public and private assistance fees: 150,000. 7. Loss of telegrams: 60,000. 8. Miscellaneous losses: 90,000. 9. Loss of 200,000 for 140 Tianjin port tugboats that have nothing to do for two months. The above nine items total 2.93 million. (B) Indirect losses: 1. Passenger losses cannot be statistically determined. 2. Losses of import and export goods can be divided into: Market price: 250,000. Freight: 100,000 (Ships cannot enter the port and are transported from other ports, which costs more freight). Damage (referring to destruction and remnants): approximately 120,000. Loss of interest: 200,000. Other losses of production, finance, and insurance companies are difficult to investigate at this time. The above indirect losses total 670,000. Among the various losses, the most severely affected are commodities such as coal merchants, rice, flour, groceries, fresh fruits, and cement. Tianjin shipping merchants are busy handling the aftermath. There are still many disputes involving both parties. What method will be adopted in the future to resolve them is also a matter of great study. On the 8th, the Tianjin shipping industry telegraphed the Ministry requesting an exemption from the tonnage dues of the trapped ships for the past two months to show compassion and sent letters to the Tianjin-Shanghai Shipping Association to provide assistance. The attached letters and telegrams are as follows: The Tianjin Shipping Industry Association's telegram to Yu, Acting Minister of Transportation, Ministry of Transportation, Nanjing: This sudden and unprecedented disaster in Dagukou has been rescued by you, and we are extremely grateful. Although shipping has been restored with great difficulty, the losses of shipping merchants during the ice disaster and suspension of shipping are enormous. It seems that tonnage dues should be exempted to show compassion and provide some compensation. Please consult with the Ministry of Finance and instruct the national customs to allow all ships that have suffered disasters to extend the validity period of their original tonnage dues by two months based on their disaster reports to show the great intention of the Ministry to protect national shipping. We urgently request that you approve this. The Tianjin Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Shipping Industry Company's letter to the Shipping Industry Association: Dear Sirs, This sudden and unprecedented ice disaster in Dagukou has caused huge losses to the industry. Referring to the precedents of various countries helping shipping merchants who have encountered disasters, the government should provide relief. In addition to the previous telegram to the Ministry to find ways to provide relief, this association should also speak out for our shipping merchants and uphold justice. Please telegraph the Ministry again as soon as possible, consult with the Ministry of Finance, and instruct the national customs to allow all ships that have suffered disasters to extend the validity period of their original ship dues by two months based on their disaster reports to show compassion and provide some compensation. At the same time, please telegraph the Shanghai Association for assistance. Human effort can make a difference, and perhaps we can invite the government authorities to approve it. We are writing to suggest that you collect the consent of all member companies in writing and then send a telegram to the Ministry to achieve the goal. We hope for your support. Tianjin Shipping Industry Association Tianjin Shipping Industry Company's telegram to the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association: Shanghai Shipping Industry Association: This sudden disaster in Dagukou has caused huge losses to shipping merchants. This association has telegraphed the Ministry, consulted with the Ministry of Finance, and notified all customs offices to allow all ships that have suffered disasters to extend the validity period of their original ship dues by two months based on their disaster reports to show compassion and provide some compensation. Please telegraph the Ministry for assistance. We earnestly hope and look forward to your assistance. Tianjin Shipping Industry Association.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attache Travels Deep into the Interior, Causing Anxiety Among the People of Chaozhou and Meizhou</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Last month, Japanese Consulate Inspector Kakuda Susumu died suddenly on the road in Mingdeli, Qi Lu. This case has not yet been properly resolved. Since then, Japanese warships have been dispatched to patrol the Chaozhou, Shantou, and South China areas one after another. Japanese naval and military officers have come to Chaozhou and Shantou for inspection in droves, like carp crossing the river. General Matsui Iwane, who promoted the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, persuaded the southwest authorities and passed through Shantou to Xiamen one day. Although he did not meet with Chaozhou and Shantou military and political officials, the captains of the Fuyong and Asagao, which are stationed in Shantou, and the president of the Japanese Residents Association held a grand welcome party. At the welcome banquet, they gave various important reports. After listening to these reports, Matsui contributed his strategy for dealing with South China, determined to promote the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere ideology, and accompanied this ideology with economic and diplomatic forces to penetrate the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou. After Matsui flew to Xiamen, Japanese Navy Commander Hosokawa, accompanied by Japanese Emperor's Military Attache Hirata, arrived in Shantou on the Yubari flagship. At that time, a rumbling cannon sound was emitted from the sea. Japanese Consul Tanaka, and more than ten important Japanese and Taiwanese people, including the president of the Residents Association, specially drove a motorboat to the Yubari to welcome them ashore. It is said that Hirata came to investigate the Kakuda case. Because of this, Li Hanhun, a member of the Eastern District Committee, happened to be taking the Haiheng ship to the province. Mayor Li Yuanhe was transferred to act as the magistrate of Shunde County, and Chen Tongchang, the former magistrate of Shunde County, was transferred to serve as the mayor of Shantou City. They were busy with the closing and handover procedures. Therefore, after Hirata and Hosokawa arrived in Shantou, they did not visit the Shantou civil and military authorities and returned to Magong Port in Taiwan on the Yubari warship at 5:30 p.m. In addition, the military attache of the Japanese Consulate General in Shamian, Guangzhou, Infantry Captain Taihei Hideo, and Artillery Captain Ogawa Kanji, stated to the provincial government through Consul General Kawasaka Tatsuo one day that they were going to travel to the Dongjiang area and requested that the military and police along the way provide protection. The Guangdong government was unable to refuse. Also, fearing that accidents might occur along the way, it specially sent a platoon leader of the military police, Liang Shiying, with six military police officers and six motorcycles to accompany and protect them along the way. Military attaches Taihei and Ogawa took a car on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway to Zhangmutou at noon on the 2nd, and then transferred to a provincial road car sent by the headquarters, and proceeded all the way. The weather has been cold and freezing for days, and drizzle has been falling. The provincial road trunk line has an uneven roadbed and is muddy and slippery. The Japanese military attaches do not mind the hardships of the journey and make a long journey in the cold wind and drizzle. They pay special attention to the scenery and terrain of the mountains and rivers wherever they pass. Even the small place names of the villages along the way are recorded in great detail. At 4:00 p.m. on the 2nd, they arrived at Huiyang City, turned to Pingshan and went to Haifeng. On the morning of the 3rd, they set off from Haifeng to Shanwei, and then turned back to Lufeng, Huilai to Puning. On the 4th, they entered Chaoyang via Liusha, and transferred to a steamer to Shantou. The people of Chaozhou and Meizhou are quite uneasy about the actions of the Japanese military attache.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Hunan Province Construction, He Jian's Policies to Govern Hunan Are Generally Progressive in Various Aspects</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Since He Jian has been in charge of military and civilian affairs in Hunan, he has achieved great results in both spiritual and material construction. He has always advocated using Confucian spiritual morality to engage in self-cultivation, family management, governance of the state, and bringing peace to the world, so that the inherent beautiful civilization can continue to illuminate the world. At the same time, he advocates adopting the new civilization of Europe and the United States so that China can also join the ranks of modern countries. Hunan Province is engaged in construction based on He Jian's proposals. Therefore, the education in the province excels other provinces in Chinese studies. There are more than 24,000 elementary and middle schools in the province. There is also Hunan First University established by the province. It is currently working to improve the rickshaw. Huang Shiheng, a provincial committee member, is appointed as the director to manage it. The provincial-level Zhongshan Library makes great efforts to preserve the ancient documents of the province. There are also Nanyue Library, Nanxuan Library, and Huda Library, etc., which collect famous ancient and modern works to benefit the people's intelligence. It strives to enable the people of the province to have a true understanding of both inherent culture and European and American civilization, so as not to make the mistake of treating precious jade as cheap and broken iron as precious. In terms of transportation, more than 3,000 kilometers of highways have been built, and more than 400 long-distance buses are in operation. There are more than 2,000 miles of long-distance telephone lines. Changsha City has established a wireless radio broadcasting station (1,000 watts), and more than 40 counties have installed radios, accounting for two-thirds of the province's area. There are more than 120 ships operating in various places. In terms of industry, there is the First Textile Factory and the Industrial Experiment Institute. The province is rich in various minerals, such as gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, zinc, aluminum, mercury, bismuth, tungsten, manganese, sulfur, arsenic, crystal, mica, graphite, coal, petroleum, etc. There is a mineral chemical test institute and a geological survey institute. In addition, agricultural experiment fields, etc. are set up to seek agricultural improvement. The main foreign trade products are mineral sand and rice, followed by firecrackers, bristles, tung oil, and summer cloth. The art products are best known for Xiang embroidery, which is world-renowned. The entire Yuehan Railway is expected to be fully open to traffic in May or June, directly reaching Guangdong and Hong Kong. The highways and railways directly connecting Hunan to Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan are also under construction. You can travel from Changsha to Nanchang, Jiangxi in the morning and arrive in the evening. The province's geographical location is actually in the transportation hub of the country. He Jian is rich in moral knowledge. He advocates that there should be a consolidated central government internally, and the establishment of national policies. He advocates international friendship and peace externally, and the realization of a world commonwealth through cultural cooperation. He believes that Chinese studies cannot only be limited to writing poetry and playing with words, but that all cultural relics, systems, and archaeology belong to it. If scientific methods are used to organize them, a new Chinese culture will be produced. He also advocates that China should advance from an agricultural country to an industrial country, so that there will be legitimate foreign trade to increase economic sources, enrich the national treasury, and avoid relying on domestic and foreign debts to make a living for a long time. The reason why Hunan Province has been able to achieve today's results is because the power is unified and there is ample time and opportunity for the rulers to engage in construction. However, Hunan Province has been disturbed by communist bandits in recent years, resulting in financial exhaustion. Seventy to eighty percent of the financial resources are spent on suppressing bandits. It is hoped that the communist bandits will be eliminated in the future, and all parties can understand and provide assistance, so that all construction will be even better.</p>
<h3>Severe Cold Weather in Fuzhou Severely Affects Various Businesses, Many Poor People Die in the Streets</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Province is located on the southeast coast, and the climate is extremely warm. There is no severe heat in summer and no severe cold in winter. Even in the coldest months of December and January, the temperature in Fahrenheit is often above 50 degrees, and you can keep warm by wearing cotton clothes. Therefore, people's homes never have stoves, and ice and snow are even rarer. After the second half of February, you can wear lined clothes, and by the beginning of March, laborers wear single clothes. Even on the coldest days, the sun is extremely warm when it comes out. Therefore, there is a saying that beggars are not afraid of frost falling (because the sun will definitely come out if frost falls the night before), but they are afraid of prolonged rain (because prolonged rain will inevitably lead to floods and there will be no place to beg). But this year the climate has suddenly become abnormal. It is already the end of February and the beginning of March, which is the season when lined clothes are changed for single clothes, but it is extremely cold. The temperature in Fahrenheit has dropped to about 30 degrees, and there is continuous overcast rain, or occasional snow. Even if there is no rain, there are dark clouds and sunlight is faint. After 9:00 p.m. at night, there are no pedestrians on the road, and even at home, you can't keep warm without heavy fur coats and stoves. Because there is no one to watch the shows, the theaters often stop performing in the evenings. Only bathhouses are doing extremely well because bathing in hot springs can keep you warm. The most pitiful are beggars and rickshaw pullers. Most of these poor people do not have cotton clothes. Even if they do, they are broken and tattered. Most beggars sleep in the streets and alleys, under the eaves of temples. Most rickshaw pullers are addicted to opium (because the opium dens are all opened by Taiwanese people, and smoking is extremely free). Beggars have no place to beg when it rains, and they are even more hungry and cold from sleeping on the ground. Rickshaw pullers have few people going out because it is cold, and even if they do go out, they mostly take public buses to avoid the cold wind. Business is extremely bad. They have no money to smoke, and they can't pay the rent for the car, so they don't dare to return to the depot. Addiction and cold break out together, so many die. According to statistics, in the past ten days or so, an average of seven or eight beggars have died on the streets of the Confucian Temple, Nanmendou, Taijiangfan, Dasuocheng, and Shuibumen every day. Rickshaw pullers also die on the cars and on the roads every night. At the same time, many ordinary poor people steal to relieve their hunger and cold. Most of the stolen items are clothes and miscellaneous items, which can be taken to the private pawnshops opened by Taiwanese people to pawn. Only on March 3, a man named Chen Xima robbed Wu Xiangren, a bill collector from Meifu Company, of 4,000 yuan in front of the Feng Bank in Meiwu Ding, but he was unable to flee due to his frozen hands and feet, and was caught. He was sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. According to his confession, his family was suffering from hunger and cold, and he was forced to do this. At the time, he thought there were only dozens of yuan, but he did not know that there was such a huge amount. Looking at his thin and haggard appearance, his clothes were ragged and tattered. He was shivering from the cold. Therefore, the prosecutors of the local court and the detectives of the Public Security Bureau have been very busy recently inspecting corpses found on the streets and arresting thieves. The Red Swastika Society and various charity groups have launched a shelter to accommodate poor and unemployed vagrants to prevent them from sleeping in the streets, and provide them with cotton clothes and rice porridge to keep them warm and relieve their hunger, so as to reduce theft. (March 7)</p>
<h3>Songjiang, the Inspector-General Commissioner Will Arrive in Song on Schedule</h3>
<p>Wang Gongyu, the Administrative Inspector-General Commissioner and District Security Commander of Songjiang District, is currently handling the handover in Tongshan. On the one hand, he has sent personnel to Songjiang to determine the location of the Public Education Hall as the office address. Yesterday, he sent Yang Fang and Zhou Jixian to Songjiang to arrange everything in the Public Education Hall office address. It is reported that the provincial government meeting has determined that the start-up fee is 500 yuan. Commissioner Wang is expected to arrive in Songjiang around the 14th to take office.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of Damaged and Shut Down Machinery</h3>
<p>The Songjiang Electric Power Company in this county suddenly damaged its machinery last night, resulting in the cessation of lighting for fifteen days in the section east of Ximen and west of Changqiao. It has reported to the county government for repairs. The county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to pay attention to public security, and the First District Office has placed mast lights to hang in sections to facilitate pedestrians. However, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and prison agencies cannot be without electricity for a day. Now that part of the machinery is generating electricity, the Public Security Bureau has sent a letter to the company requesting that it hang lines and provide lighting for the above-mentioned agencies. It is not known whether it will be able to do so.</p>
<h3>Administrative Commissioner's Office Moves to New Address</h3>
<p>Zang Qifang, the Administrative Inspector-General Commissioner of Wuxi District, went to the provincial office to ask for instructions immediately after taking office on the 2nd of this month. Because the office building had not been determined for the time being, he temporarily set up an office at the local donation collection office. Later, the government officials determined that the Huangbu Gongye Public Office building was suitable and negotiated with Hua Shaochun, a member of the Commercial Committee, to rent it for 100 yuan per month. After reporting to Commissioner Zang, he moved to Wuxi the day before yesterday. Nie Dezhao, commander of the 7th Security Brigade of Suzhou, Shang Zonghan, commander of the 9th Brigade of Yushan, Yuan Qishan, commander of the 10th Brigade of Changshu, and Zhang Pinquan, commander of the 11th Brigade of Jiangyin, all came to Wuxi before the dike was breached to report on important defense affairs. At the same time, the county magistrates, secretaries, and public security chiefs of Jiangyin, Wujin, and Taicang counties came to Wuxi one after another to ask for instructions.</p>
<h3>Silkworm Seed Production Volume in Jiangsu Province</h3>
<p>In view of the serious shortage of silkworm seeds last year, which caused disputes, the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture Improvement Management Committee specially ordered Zhou Wuxun, the chief technician of the Jiangsu Sericulture Experimental Field in Wuxi, to go to Japan for inspection, and jointly purchased spring seeds with Zhejiang Province, which have been shipped. Jiangsu Province has received a total of 30,000 sheets, which have been stored in the Luo Province Experimental Field for scheduled distribution. The total amount of spring seeds produced by various fields in the province is estimated to be more than 1.3 million sheets of raw seeds, equivalent to 1.1 million sheets of pure seeds. After deducting 400,000 sheets designated for Zhejiang Province, Jiangsu Province has a pure surplus of 700,000 sheets, which, together with the Japanese seeds purchased, is sufficient to meet the needs of this year's spring sericulture season.</p>
<h3>Meeting of Tax Bureau Chiefs from Ten Counties in Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Finance Department, in order to organize and increase the營業 tax revenue of various counties, specially arranged for Secretary Yao to convene a meeting of the營業 tax bureau chiefs from ten counties, including Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Wujin, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Wuxian, Changshu, Kunshan, Tongshan, and Taixian, at Meiyuan in Wuxi the day before. They had practical discussions on both urging payment of old debts and increasing new revenue. Finally, it was decided that all collections would be made directly, without relying on trade associations to collect on their behalf. It was also decided that all would depart in ten days to implement thorough inspections to prevent concealment. After the meeting, the bureau chiefs visited the plum blossoms together and returned to their respective offices that evening.</p>
<h3>Completion of the De Yuan Road</h3>
<p>Government employees and teachers and students of this county implemented labor service to build the De Yuan Road, which began last month. Approximately 4,000 people participated, working in sections. As of the deadline, most of the earthwork for the entire road has been completed and the road surface will be paved soon.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Additional Two Branch Lines for the Xihu Road</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Construction Department, in order to expand the Xihu Highway, plans to extend it north from Yangjian Station in the county to Fushan, naming it Yangfu Road. The Automobile Company, because the company suspected that the road was a specialized business built by the company, proposed to the Jiangsu Construction Department to proceed according to the original plan: starting from the east gate of this county, reaching Fushan, then extending northwest from Fushan to Twelve Bends, and connecting to the Chengxi Road. However, 建, eager to complete the highway network, approved the company's simultaneous progress. Changfu Road will be built by the Automobile Company, and Yangfu Road will be built by the Construction Department with hired labor. The surveying of both roads has been completed, and the roadbeds will be paved soon.</p>
<h3>Call from Staff of Social Education Organizations</h3>
<p>The social education organizations such as the people's education centers and stadiums in this county are ordered to close on the 15th of this month. All centers and fields have stopped working and are awaiting acceptance by the Education Bureau. However, there are many staff members in each center and field. Once closed, their contracts will not be completed, and they will feel financially insecure. Therefore, on the evening of the 8th, they had a dinner gathering at Shanjing Garden and unanimously decided to jointly submit a request to the Education Department to imitate the method of the Education Bureau's supervisors, to continue paying their original salaries during the training period of the directors and to pay the staff salaries until the end of the semester, in order to show consideration. They also expressed consistency with the attitudes of the counties of Suzhou and Wuxi.</p>

<p>Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong arrived in Fengjing early on the 7th on his own boat for inspection, accompanied by four attendants carrying wooden-holstered guns. After arriving, he went to the Public Security Bureau for inspection, but the bureau chief was not in the bureau. He then went to the town office for inspection, but there was no one there. Finally, he inspected the highway engineering on the Hangfeng Highway. Huang considered Fengjing to be the gateway to the province of Wood, with an unusually important strategic position, so he attached great importance to it.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Establishment of the Fenghuai Lawyers Association</h3>

<h3>YMCA Fundraising Assembly Opens, Mayor Wu Gives Earnest Speech</h3>
<p>The 36th Fundraising Assembly of the YMCA, led by Captain Wu Tiecheng, the mayor, yesterday invited the captains and members of the 60 teams and the donation committee members to a dinner at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road and held an opening ceremony. More than 400 people attended, full of vigor and spirit, which was unprecedented in previous fundraising assemblies. During the meeting, Mayor Wu first gave an opening speech, followed by a dismissal. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Attendance: Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Wang Zhengting, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Xiaoxiang, Li Zhaohuan, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Yansong, Guo Shun, Yun Xiang, Shen Siliang, Zheng Xitao, Guo Chengwen, Wang Boqi, Chen Heqin, Cai Jinjun, Pan Lun, Xu Peihuang, Pei Zhenhuan, Wang Zhengxu, Bian Yuying, Lu Meiseng, Zhuo, Zhang Shangzhen, Kechang, Zhuang Yunqing, Xian Zhizhong, Liang Xiaochu, Chen Nengfang, Qian Huafu, Zhang Mingqin, and more than 400 other people.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: "Today is the opening ceremony of the 36th Fundraising Assembly of the Shanghai YMCA. I am very pleased to invite all the team leaders and members to gather together for a meal. This time, the organization and fundraising efforts are divided into 60 teams, plus 10 junior teams and 120 donation committee members. In total, there are more than 800 people participating in this fundraising effort. The goal is to have 5,000 members, 60,000 shares of membership fees, and 20,000 yuan in donations, for a total of 80,000 yuan. Based on the experience of the past two years and the efforts of everyone, we can be confident that the results of this fundraising assembly will not only achieve the goal, but will also break the previous records. We remember that in the ninth year of the Republic of China, when the National Congress of the YMCA was held in Guangzhou, Premier Sun gave a speech to the representatives, in which he said, 'If we want to create a good country, we must first have good character in everyone. Among all of us in China, those who have complete character are the YMCA.' This is Premier Sun's most alerting, simplest, and most descriptive sentence about the purpose of the YMCA. Now the people of the country are crying out for national salvation. In many places, they are not only crying out, but are already directly and indirectly doing the work of saving the country. Among this work, what is the most difficult and fundamental? It is to establish the Republic of China, so that the Chinese nation can achieve equality and freedom in the world. But according to Premier Sun's instructions, if we want to build a good country, we must first have good character, so we must know whether our country can be saved and whether our nation can achieve equality and freedom depends on whether the character of our nation is sound. Premier Sun said, 'Those who have character are the YMCA. It does not mean that there are no organizations with character besides the YMCA, because the YMCA is entirely based on promoting character as its purpose, and it can create complete character. The Chinese people's interpretation of the word character is often too narrow. In the past, people generally thought that being upright, not being corrupt, and not doing bad things meant having good character. But this interpretation is not in line with the present era, because ancient society and life were simple, while modern society and life are complex. It was easy to be a good person in the past, but it is difficult to be a good person now. Modern people must cope with modern society and achieve the purpose of survival, so the components of modern character are not just passively being a person. Just having noble morals is not enough for complete character. It also requires knowledge and ability. Only a person with all kinds of character is complete, a good citizen, and can build a good country. Therefore, the previous passive character was only about cultivating oneself. The current active character must also benefit the world. This kind of active character cannot be created only in the family or in school. It must be combined in all aspects. The YMCA's purpose is to create this kind of character, so the YMCA is a social and moral organization. It is not just talking, but also working hard. Since the YMCA is a social organization, everyone should work hard to maintain and help it follow this path together, seek to build the country, and revitalize the nation. Therefore, the whole society must be mobilized to help this fundraising assembly. On the one hand, it is fundraising, and on the other hand, it can measure whether the society sympathizes with the work done by the YMCA. There are 800 people participating in this fundraising assembly, such a great force, active in one month, I think that with your faith and enthusiasm, the impact will be great. That is why I am confident that this fundraising assembly can succeed. I wish this victory in advance."</p>
<p>Wang Rutang's Speech: "Today's opening ceremony of the 36th Fundraising Assembly of the YMCA is a good sign with so many people participating. I have four meanings for the YMCA: 1. The YMCA is always charging forward. Sports, hygiene, and other things were initially promoted by the YMCA, and now they have become popular. 2. The YMCA comrades are always working hard. For example, last year's fundraising was in a bad economic situation, but it was still able to exceed the goal. 3. The YMCA comrades can continue to serve continuously. Dr. 鄘富灼 served as the president for 13 years and is still a director. 4. Shanghai is a big city in the country. The YMCA in Shanghai not only serves the Shanghai community, but can also be a model for the whole country. This year's fundraising assembly has such a spirit and will surely achieve its goal. I hope this spirit will be maintained forever and continue to benefit the society and the country."</p>

<p>The Cotton Control Commission of the National Economic Council has been working to improve cotton production, and after two years of effort, it has achieved considerable success.

This year, the seed distribution area will be expanded to Hebei Province. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ordering a Large Quantity of Seeds from the United States</p>
<p>The Cotton Control Commission is working to improve the quality of cotton production in order to have high-quality output. Every year, it orders seeds from the United States and transports them to various improvement areas for distribution and planting. In the past two years, cotton production in the Northwest has gradually achieved considerable success. This year, the Commission has purchased 21 tons of cotton seeds from the United States, which will be transported to various improvement areas and distributed to cotton farmers for planting by the local cotton production improvement institutes.</p>
<p>Expanding Seed Distribution Area to Hebei</p>
<p>In the past, the Commission's cotton improvement work was limited to Shaanxi and Henan provinces. Last year, recognizing that the land in Hebei Province is fertile and very suitable for cotton planting, it planned to distribute seeds in the province. However, the processing time was later, and significant results were not achieved. Therefore, starting this year, the Commission has decided to distribute seeds in Hebei Province, following the same procedures as in Shaanxi and Henan provinces.</p>

Regarding foreign countries, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Cochinchina, for the purpose of reorganizing the original domestic products exhibition hall, met with Mr. Wang, the chief representative of the Singapore domestic product manufacturers, last year, and entrusted the hall to solicit a large number of exhibits. Due to the fact that it was the end of the year, it was not possible to handle it. Now, with the start of the new year, the Chamber of Commerce has sent another letter of entrustment. It is said that a product collection office has been set up in the hall, and it is planned to start the collection soon.</p>

It is believed that all sectors of society, admiring Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's hard work and great achievements, will actively participate and complete this undertaking as soon as possible. The method for collecting national salvation funds from the hot water industry has been approved by the municipal government and a public notice has been issued. Originally scheduled to begin on the first of this month, it has been delayed because the industry's locations are widespread and the business situation has not been fully investigated. The work is being actively carried out, and will be implemented immediately after the investigation is completed. Furthermore, regarding the proposal to collect national salvation funds from vegetable stalls, restaurants, and taverns, the office has separately convened meetings with representatives from various districts. The colleagues in each district have also held meetings, all of whom agree that they should enthusiastically assist the aviation national salvation movement and show their sincere patriotism, which is admirable. A general meeting will be convened soon to decide when to begin. In order to open up social customs, promote interest in flying, and develop the habit of aerial movements, this Association, together with the China Flying Society, is holding free sightseeing flights. Starting on March 1st, flights will take place every Wednesday and Saturday. All members are interested and participate enthusiastically, causing great crowds. Thanks to the efforts of all colleagues in promoting the collection of national salvation funds from various industries, and the enthusiastic support of compatriots from all walks of life, the results have been excellent. It is hoped that all field secretaries will do their best to assist in increasing the results and completing the mission as soon as possible, etc. Following this, the field secretaries reported on the progress of contacts and investigations. The meeting discussed various donation solicitation plans before adjourning at 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>To raise 500,000 yuan in the city to purchase aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday, the Chinese Aviation Association's Standing Committee decided to have Chief Captain Wu personally instruct Chief Secretary Li Dachao to plan and organize the undertaking. Yesterday at noon, leaders from all walks of life had lunch at the municipal government to discuss implementation methods. It is now learned that people from all sectors are actively promoting the effort. Yesterday, the office received a letter from Zhao Xianji, chairman of the Metal Trades Guild, expressing great sympathy for the purchase of aircraft to celebrate the birthday and pledging a donation of 1,000 yuan in national currency from the guild, which will be delivered soon. A letter of thanks for the enthusiasm has been sent. It is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will hear the news and contribute enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that Liu Chunshan, leader of the vaudeville industry in the city, came to the Chief Captain's Office yesterday, saying that wireless listeners have voluntarily donated money to purchase aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's birthday and that he intends to collect and deliver the funds on their behalf. The office considered Mr. Liu's enthusiastic support to be commendable and has appointed him as the leader of the 470th Squadron of the Solicitation Team, asking him to vigorously promote and expand the solicitation, gathering small contributions to achieve great things and complete the undertaking as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that when the Chief Captain's Office announced the national salvation funds from the travel industry for January, the amount of 252.57 yuan from the Wu Gong Hotel was inadvertently omitted. This is now specially noted.</p>

<p>Screening</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Audience for Famine Relief Film</p>
<p>The film about the famine in Lusi, produced by the Lusi Famine Relief Association, was shown at the YMCA. Yesterday was the last showing, and the audience was extremely large. According to a member of the Association, the purpose of showing the film was to give people from all walks of life a deep understanding and awareness of the suffering and disaster situation in the mainland. Although the screenings have been temporarily suspended, they may be shown in different districts if necessary. The large number of audience members at the screenings shows that the Chinese people's enthusiasm for disaster relief is not behind anyone else. The Association had distributed a large number of admission tickets to various sectors in advance, and a portion of the ticket funds have not yet been delivered in a timely manner. In order to clear the procedures, it has been decided to close the account within three days. It is hoped that all sectors will remember the suffering of the disaster victims and quickly deliver the ticket funds to the temporary office of the Flood Relief Fundraising Group on the third floor of the YMCA within three days from today, so that they can be remitted to the disaster area to help the victims.</p>

<p>Cargo Ship Sunk by Tianlun in Xinjiang</p>
<p>Ningbo Native Place Association Cables Ministry for Investigation</p>
<p>After the Incident, Xin Jiangtian Acted as If Nothing Had Happened</p>
<p>Three Drowned in Wanli Boat, No Response to Calls for Help</p>
<p>Also Sends Letters to the Maritime Administration and China Merchants Bureau Requesting Fair Handling</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times News Agency, the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai received a letter from the owner of the Jin Wanli sailing boat, reporting that it was sunk by the China Merchants Bureau's Xin Jiangtian steamship. At the time, the crew of the sailing boat called for help, but the steamship ignored them and sped away, resulting in the drowning of three people. The Association has cabled the Ministry of Communications and sent letters to the Maritime Administration and the China Merchants Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation and handling of the matter. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Separate Letters to the Two Bureaus</p>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai sent separate letters to the Shanghai Maritime Administration and the state-run China Merchants Bureau, requesting a thorough investigation into the sinking of the sailing boat and the drowning of the crew members by the Xin Jiangtian steamship. The original letter stated: "We are writing to inform you that, according to compatriots Wang Youmei and Cao Hongsheng, as well as the bereaved families of the Jin Wanli sailing boat, Youmei and others opened the Tongji Hardware and Oil Company in Ningbo. This time, they purchased 60 tons of diesel oil in Shanghai and entrusted the Gongji Customs Broker to hire the Yu Wanli sailing boat to transport it to Ningbo. Due to waiting for favorable winds, they did not set sail until about 3:00 AM on February 18th. When sailing to the Shuiyawo sandbar in the Sanjia River, they saw a steamship anchored there (the Taigu Company's Chengdu steamship). Our boat sailed six li past that steamship and saw a steamship coming from the opposite direction (namely, the Xin Jiangtian steamship), with a red light hanging on the left side. Our boat immediately sailed to the left, but unexpectedly, the Xin Jiangtian steamship suddenly turned to the left and continued to sail straight ahead, making it impossible to avoid a collision, and our boat was immediately sunk. At the time, the crew members called for help, but the Xin Jiangtian steamship ignored them and sped away. There were a total of eleven crew members on the wooden boat, of whom three drowned and disappeared without a trace. Eight people climbed onto a sampan and drifted with the waves to Wangjiawan in Pudong, where they luckily survived. They immediately reported to the Zhangjiabang Customs. It was not until the 22nd that the details were fully learned. We have reported to the Shanghai Maritime Administration for investigation and have sent a letter to the China Merchants Bureau for negotiation. More than ten days have passed, but we have not received a reply. We have no choice but to appeal to your association to uphold justice and provide assistance." The Association has investigated the case and believes that the sinking of the cargo ship and the drowning of the crew members are extremely serious matters. Based on the above information, we urgently request your bureau to investigate and handle the matter fairly and provide a reply.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Communications</p>
<p>The Association also sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications, requesting it to urgently instruct the Shanghai Maritime Administration to handle the matter fairly. The original telegram stated: "Minister of Communications Yu of Nanjing, according to compatriots Wang Youmei, Cao Hongsheng, and the bereaved families of the Jin Wanli sailing boat (see previous text), more than ten days have passed, but we have not received a reply. Please send a telegram to the Ministry of Communications, instructing the Shanghai Maritime Administration to handle the matter fairly. We are deeply grateful. Ningbo Native Place Association, Yu Qiaqing, etc." The Tax-Paying Chinese Association of the French Concession in Shanghai held a standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Committee members Shang Mujiang, Xu Xiuting, Long Jingyan, Huang Xianggu, Mao Yun, Li Weiliang, and Qu Zhenhua (representing Li Weiliang) attended, and Zhang Shishi was present as an observer. Huang Xianggu chaired the meeting, and Zhang Shishi took the minutes. After performing the customary formalities, Chairman Huang Xianggu first reported on the recent work of the Association, followed by discussions on various matters. The "Detailed Rules for the Association's Operation" were passed (resolved) with amendments and it was decided to assign personnel to duty on Sundays. Regarding the "Organization of Special Committees," (resolved) it was decided to have committee member Jingyan plan and handle the matter. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>World-Famous Comedy Star Charlie Chaplin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday - Actress Paulette Goddard Accompanies Him - Scheduled to Continue South on the Same Ship This Morning</h3>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, the world-famous and enduring movie comedy star, decided to travel east with his brother Sydney Chaplin five years ago after completing the film "City Lights." However, because the ship went directly to Hong Kong after passing through Japan, he was unable to visit Shanghai. This time, after completing his new work "Modern Times," he is revisiting the Far East with Paulette Goddard, the rising star actress he discovered (the female lead in "Modern Times"). He arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Dollar Steamship Company's President Coolidge, after passing through Japan. He is scheduled to continue south on the same ship this morning. His destination is Bali. The details of his arrival and departure are recorded below.</p>
<p>Interview Aboard the Ship - Nearly Escaping in Disguise</p>
<p>The President Coolidge docked at Float No. 12 in the Huangpu River at 1:00 PM yesterday. The passenger ferry departed from the new customs pier at 1:45 PM. No fewer than twenty reporters and photographers from local Chinese and foreign newspapers went to interview and take photos. At around 2:00 PM, although the names of Charlie Chaplin and Paulette Goddard were found on the passenger manifest of the President Coolidge and their first-class cabin FD No. 3 was located, they were nowhere to be seen. Just as people were remembering his escape in disguise from a hotel surrounded by reporters and crowds during his trip to Europe and were afraid that he would repeat his old trick, he was discovered on the deck. Chaplin then became the focus of dozens of cameras, and the sound of "click" was incessant.</p>
<p>Gentlemanly Demeanor - Not Like a Tramp at All</p>
<p>The general impression of Chaplin, whether among men, women, old, young, educated, or uneducated, is that he is like a "tramp," whose staggering and comical walking posture is enough to make people burst into laughter at first sight. However, when he met with reporters, he was a middle-aged gentleman with snow-white hair in his forties. The only resemblance to the Chaplin we see on the screen was his relatively short stature. Miss Goddard was also by his side, leaning on the railing and smiling. The lady is about twenty years old, delicate and lively, like a charming little bird, and is said to be Chaplin's wife.</p>
<p>Waving Goodbye - Revealing a Comical Attitude</p>
<p>When the reporters finished taking photos and were about to ask Chaplin some questions, Chaplin said, "Please meet me at the Cathay Hotel at 6:30 PM tonight, and we can talk freely." He then went down the President Coolidge with Miss Goddard and others and boarded the specially prepared "Gypsy" yacht, which first met the passenger ship and sailed upstream, cutting through the waves. After boarding the yacht, he seemed uneasy that the reporters were left on the passenger ferry, so he waved goodbye through the window, unintentionally revealing his comical posture, which made everyone laugh. In fact, the reason why Chaplin has achieved today's position is precisely because he often reveals such sincere emotions in every film he stars in.</p>
<p>Impression of Shanghai - Just One Sentence: Too Exciting</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM, the reporters gathered again. After Chaplin disembarked, he was invited by friends to tour the city for a preliminary sightseeing. They were led to the A-shaped room on the fifth floor. The room's layout and furnishings were purely British style, as a gift from the Cathay Hotel management, perhaps because Chaplin is British. Miss Goddard stayed in Room No. 9 on the same floor, opposite Chaplin's room. After Chaplin entered the room, he lit a cigarette and sat by the fireplace. Regarding his first impression of Shanghai, he said, "Too exciting."</p>
<p>Marriage Question - A Wonderful Evasive Answer</p>
<p>He then said that this trip started from Hollywood in the film city, passing through Honolulu, Japan, and Shanghai. He will take the original ship to Hong Kong tomorrow morning and then go to Manila, Bali, Indochina, and other places. The entire trip will be completed in May. He may come to Shanghai again for a short stay in March. Chaplin is the only opponent of sound films, only advocating dubbing to enhance the drama of the play. "City Lights" is his successful attempt. He has not wavered in this view to this day. He believes that sound films create obstacles to acting everywhere. Therefore, in "Modern Times," he still did not speak, only sang. When reporters asked if he had been engaged to or married Miss Goddard, he smiled and said that this question should be answered by Miss Goddard, which can be described as a wonderful evasion. He currently has no plans to continue starring in films but intends to direct a film starring Miss Goddard. It is rumored that he intends to shoot a film in Bali, which is impossible because he has not brought any filming equipment. Regarding the Far East issue, he said that when he was in Japan, people also asked for his thoughts, but he did not say much.</p>
<p>Starring in Various Films - Earning General Sympathy</p>
<p>Chaplin has been making comedy films in the United States for twenty-two years. He writes, directs, and stars in all of them. He is not only a skilled film actor but also a philosopher of life, a sociologist, and an artist, and is loved by film audiences all over the world. The films he stars in are often satirical and sympathetic to the general public.</p>
<h3>Two Gunny Sacks - Containing Eight Pieces of a Dissected Corpse - Strange Murder Case - Truth Still Unknown</h3>
<p>A strange murder case was discovered at 6:00 AM yesterday in the small river in the western part of Kangqu Bridge, Kangqu Road, Nanshi. Zhou Chen, a woman living at No. 1397 Kangqu Road, saw a man picking up trash in the small river while she was out washing clothes. He used a bamboo hook to pull two gunny sacks to the riverbank. Upon inspecting the sacks, she found eight horrifying pieces of a male corpse. The head and body were divided into two sections and placed in one gunny sack. The arms were divided into two sections, and the legs and feet were divided into four sections and placed in another sack. The deceased was estimated to be in his thirties or forties. It appeared that he was murdered and then dissected into eight pieces to move the body and escape punishment. The corpse's face had no fresh blood and the skin appeared purple and yellow. The woman reported the incident to the police station, who in turn ordered the local police chief to report to the court for an autopsy. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM yesterday, Prosecutor Li was assigned to lead the coroner and others to the scene. The autopsy revealed that the deceased had indeed been murdered before being dissected and moved here. It was ordered that the death certificate be filled out and photos taken, and that the body be placed in a coffin by the charitable organization and the murderer be arrested and investigated.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Kidnapping Case: Bandits Captured in Shanghai, Two Victims, Zhusheng and Rongsheng, Rescued; Court Approves Transfer to Qingpu for Trial</h3>
<p>Around midnight on December 19th of last year, a group of bandits suddenly appeared at the home of wealthy Zhang Guixing in Jiagang Village, Qianta Township, thirty miles southwest of Qingpu County. They kidnapped Zhang's grandson, Ah Hugen (four years old). Upon hearing the alarm, the local militia rushed to apprehend them. The bandits opened fire, killing militiaman Gu Shaolin. The bandits then fled with the victim, demanding a ransom of 30,000 yuan. Zhao Zhen, a detective from the Second Team of the First District of the Jiangsu Provincial River Security Force, learned that the kidnappers were hiding in Shanghai. He came to Shanghai with an official letter and, around 10 PM the other night, collaborated with Pang Yutang, a Chinese detective of the Old Zha police station. They rushed to the Yong'an Company's amusement park and arrested Zhu Ziliang (also known as Songliang), a native of Pudong, who was involved in the case. Subsequently, at No. 47 Li Mei Road in the French Concession, they apprehended two more accomplices, Wu A'jin (also known as Jinsheng), a native of Pudong, and his concubine, Chen Fengbao. They also rescued two young kidnap victims, Li Zhusheng (13 years old) and Li Rongsheng (9 years old), who had been kidnapped from Nanbang, Qingpu. Zhusheng's father is named Yutang, and Rongsheng's father is named Qingtang. All were taken back to the police station. Later, Wei Shixiong was apprehended at No. 44 Luzon Road. Yesterday morning, they were all taken to the First Special District Court's Criminal Court No. 1. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, explained the situation and agreed to the Qingpu River Public Security Team's request for transfer. Zhao Zhen then filed the case, requesting approval for the transfer. He stated that the victim, Ah Hugen, had not yet been rescued, and the official letter would be submitted later due to time constraints. When questioned, all defendants confessed. Judge Feng reviewed the confessions and ordered the four defendants and the two rescued victims to be handed over to the Qingpu officials for investigation.</p>
<h3>French Concession: Red Pill Manufacturing Den Cracked; Two Siblings, the Masterminds, Flee; Two Women Arrested for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Lu Zhulin, a detective, and Song Yunfeng, a constable of the French Police, learned on the 7th of this month that someone was privately manufacturing red pills at No. 32, Bing'an Lane, Ailai Ge Road. They immediately reported to West Inspector Bu Xiaokao, and together they went to the location. They arrested Wang Nannan, an 18-year-old woman from Changshu, and Chen Sanyuan, a 23-year-old woman. They seized 4,000 red pills. The women confessed that the owners were Zhang Genlin and Zhang Qiaolin, siblings, but their current whereabouts are unknown. They also confessed that other dens were located at No. 11 Hengmao Lane, Tiniyin Road, and No. 10 Zhengjia Muqiao. Upon receiving this information, the detectives immediately searched those two locations. They seized 6,000 red pills in the attic of No. 10 Zhonghua Lane, and a large quantity of equipment for manufacturing red pills, such as drying boxes, was seized at No. 11 Hengmao Lane. However, no one was apprehended at either location. They were taken to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court's Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The police station's lawyer first explained the case and requested an extension to investigate further. When questioned, Wang Nannan confessed that she was a maid in Bing'an Lane and knew nothing about the red pill manufacturing. Chen Sanyuan claimed that she was visiting Wang Nannan in Bing'an Lane and was mistakenly arrested. Their other statements were evasive. Judge Li ordered a further hearing on the morning of the 19th.</p>
<h3>Hengxiang Bank Opium Case: Tea Boy Testifies; Defendant Shao Liangru Denies; Xu and Yue Each Post 1,000 Yuan Bail</h3>
<p>Due to the discovery of a large amount of opium at the Hengxiang Bank, located at No. 18, Lane 120, Ningbo Road, Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective chief, and Liu Junjie and Bao Lisheng, detectives of the Chief Inspectorate, went to search the premises. They seized over a hundred taels of opium and paraphernalia and arrested Shao Liangru (also known as Jian San), the bank's manager, and Xu Shixian (also known as Yansheng) and Yue Xiubiao (also known as Ming San). The First Special District Court interrogated them and adjourned the case. Shao was later released on bail by the court. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide reopened the Criminal Court No. 1 for further interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the police station's lawyer, stated that the police had found a former tea boy at the bank named Zhou A'jin, who testified that on January 24th of this year, the defendant Shao Liangru ordered him and the driver Hai Sheng to move two wooden boxes into the vault. Shao then opened the boxes, which were full of opium. The next day, Shao ordered people to smoke opium for a whole day and then repackaged it into cigarette tins, which Hai Sheng transported out in batches. He also saw Shao's friend and an unknown man come to collect several packages of opium. He wrote a statement. However, Zhou was not present today, and the police still need to continue their investigation, so they requested an adjournment. When questioned, Shao Liangru denied these facts, claiming that there was no tea boy named Zhou A'jin in his employment. The driver, Zhang Haisheng, also testified that he did not know Zhou A'jin and that the facts were not as Zhou stated. The defendants' lawyers, Fan Gang, E'sen, and Wu Lin Kun, objected to the police's request, stating that the medical examiner had found that the defendants Xu Shixian and Yue Xiubiao were not opium addicts and requested that they be released on bail. Judge Feng adjourned the case. Xu and Yue each posted a bail of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhuxuan Case: Public Trial Today; Ma Brothers Still at Large</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan, a key suspect in the incitement of the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, allegedly incited false testimony while detained at the external hospital (i.e., Guangci Police Hospital). After the incident, prison guards Ma Xianxiang and Ma Xiancai, and the warden Wang Yushou, escaped one after another. The Second Special District Court's Procuratorate repeatedly interrogated the case. As a result, Gu Zhuxuan's brother, Gu Songmao, and guards Wu Jing, Ma Xianxiang, and the two escaped Ma brothers and Wang Yushou were all suspected of inciting perjury. A public prosecution was filed with the Criminal Court of the same court. The Ma brothers had previously submitted statements to both courts, and the Procuratorate had ordered them to appear for questioning, but they had not turned themselves in after many days. It is now learned that the case is scheduled for a public trial at 2:00 PM today by Judge Li Changnian in Criminal Court No. 1.</p>
<h3>Adulterer and Adulteress Caught in Bed; Husband's Jealousy Leads to Stabbing; Wife Injured, Man Arrested</h3>
<p>Man Zhengzhen, a 36-year-old native of Zhenjiang, lived in a lean-to at No. 11 Maidie'an Road in the French Concession. He used to work as a clerk at the Huaqing Bathhouse on Sanma Road but had been unemployed for the past month. Man's wife, Tan, 28, had been unfaithful and recently became involved with Fu Laoda, a Jurong native who worked as a back scrubber in the Chunquan Port area of Zhabei. The other night, while her husband was out, Tan invited Fu Laoda to her home for a tryst. Just as Man Zhengzhen returned home and pushed open the door, he saw the adulterer and adulteress sleeping in bed together. Consumed by jealousy, he grabbed an iron ladle and struck his wife Tan on the head. Seeing the situation, the adulterer fled. At that moment, Tan also became enraged and grabbed a kitchen knife to attack her husband. Man Zhengzhen stepped forward and disarmed her. Tan's right middle and index fingers were severed by the knife, and Man struck Tan on the head with the knife, causing her to bleed profusely. Huang A'er and others, who lived nearby, heard the commotion and rushed in, horrified. They reported the incident to the police station, who ordered officers to arrest Man and take the murder weapon to the police station. The injured woman was taken to the hospital. Yesterday afternoon, Man was taken to the Second Special District Court's Criminal Court No. 1. The police station's lawyer first described the case and requested a postponement. When questioned, Man Zhengzhen stated that his wife was having an affair, which he already knew. Because he had no proof, he did not take action. Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, his wife gave him three yuan and told him to return to his hometown to find work. He knew it was a ploy to get him out of the house, so he pretended to agree and secretly went to chat with friends. When he returned home at 11:30 PM and pushed open the door, he found the adulterer and adulteress in bed together, so he committed the act. Judge Li ordered a further hearing on the 19th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Elderly Drunkard Falls into Creek and Drowns</h3>
<p>Xue Wencuan, a 67-year-old local resident of No. 17 Xinzha Road in the Public Concession, was old and frail. The other night, he attended a wedding banquet at a relative's home in West Shanghai. He drank too much alcohol. Late at night, on his way home, he walked behind the Wangjia Lane in Caojiadu. There was a small creek there, not very deep. Xue, drunk and unsteady, fell into the creek and drowned. It was not until dawn yesterday that a passerby discovered his body and reported it to the police, who ordered the local guarantor to report to the local court for an inquest. The coroner was sent to the scene to claim the body for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Families of Missing Children Flock to Xinzha Bureau to Identify Children</h3>
<p>Starting at 11:30 PM on the 6th of this month, Xiao Huaiyu, Liu Bingrong, Zang Nai, Zhang Shuwen, and Sun Youzhi, detectives of the Zhabei Xinzha Branch, successively cracked down on four male and female kidnappers and rescued three kidnapped boys and girls. Including two female kidnappers carrying one boy and one girl each. After questioning was completed yesterday, the male kidnapper Zhang Wenliang (i.e., Zhang Xiaosizi), the suspected kidnapper Zeng Can (the husband of the female kidnapper Zeng Ye), the female kidnappers Zeng Ye and Wang Li, and the rescued children, except for the five-year-old boy Huang Zhangwanzi, who was claimed by his father, there was still a four-year-old girl named Nannan, and Pan Feng, the foster parent who bought Nannan, and an eleven-year-old girl Ma Xiaohuzi, and two female kidnappers carrying one boy and one girl each, totaling nine people, both adults and children, were transferred to the Xinzha Branch and then to the Public Security Bureau headquarters. It is also known that Ji Yuanpu and Wang Huibai, the captain and vice-captain of the Detective Brigade, paid close attention to the case. Around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, they personally visited the branch to inspect. Since the cracking of the case, over the past two days, over two hundred families of missing children from the Chinese Concession have gone to the branch to identify their children. Yesterday evening, several families were still inquiring at the branch. A list is excerpted below:</p>

<h3>Foreign Boy Killed in Bike Accident</h3>

When they were driving west on Hongqiao Road, a Maotai Yoko No. 9460 truck, fully loaded with bricks, driven by Li Zhengan, was also driving in the same direction. Suddenly, the three split to the left and right and clung to the back of the truck. Then, Berser rushed to the front and clung to the left truck fender, placing his feet on the bicycle's crossbar. Although the laborers on the truck, such as Shen Yeyu, tried to stop them, they did not listen. Then, Berser accidentally lost his grip and fell to the right, and was run over by the truck's left rear wheel, causing serious injuries. The driver immediately braked, but it was too late.

<h3>Wang Changlin's Stepmother Wu Shi's Appeal Case Concludes Yesterday; Years of Nurturing Meant to Obtain Filial Piety; Failure to Provide Support Violates Law and Humanity</h3>
<p>Wang Shi, the stepmother of Wang Changlin, a manager at the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, is 64 years old. Because her son did not support her after returning from studying abroad, and after repeated arguments, he only gave her 40 yuan per month, which was not enough to live on, she filed a lawsuit against Changlin last winter, demanding support and repayment of educational expenses. The First Special District Court made a preliminary judgment. However, Wang Shi, believing that the judgment was not in line with her request, hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Wang Changlin also expressed dissatisfaction with the original judgment and filed a counterclaim. Yesterday afternoon, the judges of the Second Branch of the High Court held a joint trial. Neither party was present in person, and each was represented by a lawyer. First, Wang Shi's lawyer stated the grounds for the appeal, stating that what the appellant requested in the first instance was to: 1. Repay various debts incurred since 19 years ago, totaling 5,000 yuan; 2. Pay 100 yuan per month for alimony from November of last year. The preliminary judgment ordered Wang Changlin to repay 1,300 yuan for the first item and to pay 60 yuan per month for the second item, which was too far apart from what was requested. That is why the appeal was filed. Changlin was adopted by Wang Shi as her successor at the age of 14. The latter spared no expense to educate him. He went abroad to study at the age of 22. During these years, most of the family property that was sold was used to nurture Changlin, hoping that he would be able to fulfill his filial duty in the future. However, when he returned to the country in 18 years, he drove his stepmother away in 19 years. Later, although he gave 40 yuan per month for alimony, it was rarely given willingly and only given sporadically after repeated requests, causing the woman to live in debt. Over the years, including medical expenses, she has spent over 10,000 yuan. Now she is only asking for 5,000 yuan, which is the lowest amount. Changlin currently lives in a Western-style house and drives a car, and owns land in Jiangwan and other places. His life is prosperous and luxurious, which is due to his higher education. However, the one who educated him is now suffering. From the perspective of law and humanity, Changlin should not be so abusive. However, at the first hearing of the first instance, he denied that the woman was his stepmother and then threatened to litigate to the end. The woman is in her twilight years and cannot bear this. Moreover, creditors are constantly knocking on the door, and her livelihood is difficult. She should be judged according to the amount requested by the woman and the appeal of the respondent should be rejected. Then, Wang Changlin's lawyer argued that Shi left home on her own initiative under the pretext of going to Hangzhou to burn incense. How could she be accused of being driven away? And since August of 19 years, he has been giving 40 yuan per month, and he has not heard any objections. The woman originally owned hundreds of thousands of dollars of family property, which she sold over the years, and Changlin never touched a penny. Her intention to increase the alimony is because Changlin only earned 180 yuan when he paid 40 yuan, and now he earns more than 300 yuan a month, so she also wants to increase it. In fact, Changlin's current financial situation is far from what it used to be. Therefore, he requested that the original judgment be reversed and that 40 yuan be given per month and the appellant's appeal be rejected. Judge Han then declared the debate closed and scheduled the judgment for a later date.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association - Medical Care for Rickshaw Pullers' Illnesses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association recognized the extreme need of its members for medical assistance.

This has benefited over a hundred people. The association has also decided to establish its own sanatorium, located above the branch association in the western district, which will soon be completed and opened. The internal facilities include more than twenty beds, a pathology laboratory, a surgical operating room, a patient bathroom, sterilization and washing facilities, and all food and drink for inpatients are provided by the sanatorium.

<h3>Child Abduction - Monk Ni Arrested the Other Day</h3>
<p>Gen Sheng, the five-year-old boy of Wang Liu, a woman from Tongzhou who previously lived at No. De'anli, Taopeng Road, disappeared while playing at the door at 3:00 PM on November 10 last year. There has been no news of him since. Recently, a fellow villager, Monk Ni, went to Ms. Wang's home at No. 2 Linqing Road and said, "Your child was abducted by Ni Futang. He can be found, but it will cost 40 yuan." Ms. Wang knew that he was the mastermind, so she feigned agreement to raise the money and secretly followed him to Guianli, Linyin Road, Nanshi, where she saw him enter. The next day, she inquired and Futang claimed that he had abducted the child at the time and temporarily placed him with Yu in Pudong. He has now taken him to his home in Nantong and hidden him. Ms. Wang immediately returned to the village and reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched Detective Li Hongsheng to secretly go with detectives from the Public Security Bureau to arrest Monk Ni the other day. He was taken back to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special First Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu from the Engineering Bureau recounted the case and said that the defendant claimed at the police station that Ms. Wang had been living with him for many years and that the child was born to Ms. Wang's former husband. The child is currently in Zhang Xingzhen, Lao Honggang, Nantong, at his father's place. Ms. Wang went there to negotiate with him, but the father, Lao Ni, said that he had spent 28 yuan to buy the child. Later, they went together to the local Public Security Bureau to temporarily detain Wang's child. Ms. Wang has not yet appeared in court, so please postpone the case and send an official letter from the court to the Nantong County Government to bring the child to Shanghai. The defendant was questioned, and his statements were evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the case for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Assaults for Debt Collection</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Guangdong Road and Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road, at around 8:00 PM last night, a rogue named Long Huaqing, 26 years old, was demanding a debt of 3 yuan from another rogue surnamed Zhang. However, Mr. Zhang had no money on him, which led to an argument. Long Huaqing grabbed him and refused to let go, threatening violence. Unexpectedly, Mr. Zhang pulled out a sharp knife and stabbed Long Huaqing in the chest, deeply injuring his lung. Long Huaqing, in great pain, immediately released his grip and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailant took the opportunity to escape. Nearby constables heard the alarm and arrived, taking him to the hospital for treatment, where his condition was critical.</p>
<p>Xinzha Road A Jiangbei man named Zhao Guibao, 26 years old, had a big dispute with a man named Yang Dabai on the roadside at around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon while passing through Xinzha Road. It is reported that Zhao Guibao owed Li Dabai 12 yuan in hui money and had not returned it for a long time. Therefore, when Li encountered Zhao Guibao, he demanded it from him, which led to the dispute. However, Zhao Guibao stubbornly refused to pay. Li Dabai became impatient and pulled out a hidden knife, stabbing Zhao in the left shoulder before fleeing. Zhao screamed for help. Nearby constables heard the news and rushed to the scene, but the assailant had already fled. They quickly took him to the hospital for treatment and reported the case to the police station.</p>
<h3>Theft - Case Solved for Traffic Cargo</h3>
<p>Recently, thefts of passenger and freight have occurred at the Shanghai North Railway Station Qiujiang Road Joint Transportation Freight Depot, and thieves have impersonated employees of specialized transportation companies to design fraud to transport goods. The relevant Su-Song Third Police Section, after receiving reports, secretly ordered an investigation and has solved the entire case. The detailed process is as follows:</p>
<p>Cargo Fraud</p>
<p>Wang Er, a 26-year-old man from Shangyu, Zhejiang, is idle and does not engage in honest work. However, he is well-dressed, and at first glance, he looks like a formal businessman. Unexpectedly, he is full of tricks and mixed into the North-South Joint Transportation Freight Depot, impersonating an employee of the local Huashengyi Transportation Company, stealing a bundle of North-South Joint Transportation cargo labels and taking the opportunity to defraud. On the 4th of this month, Zeng Yiji Tobacco Shop at No. 29, Kai Feng Road, Re He Road, sent a clerk, Zhu Ruilian, pushing a rickshaw, to deliver several pieces of passenger and freight (said to be porcelain clocks, thermos bottles, and other foreign sundries) to the North Station for transportation. Wang found out about this and used all kinds of tricks to deceive her and took the goods. When the fraud was discovered and reported to the police, Wang had already taken the stolen goods and fled with his accomplices.</p>
<p>Investigation and Arrest</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after a few days, Wang had spent all the money he had obtained from selling the stolen goods. He was again tempted to commit crimes and secretly returned to the original place, intending to use the same tricks. However, Zhu Ruilian was investigating after being deceived. They met face to face, and Zhu immediately grabbed him and handed him over to the traffic police for investigation. Wang initially denied it, but with Zhu's accurate identification, he could not deny it. He then claimed that he had accomplices who were hiding in the French Concession. As a result, the investigation was unsuccessful. Later, Chen Shenggong, an employee of Wang Hongji Transportation Company at No. 5, Baoshanli, Qipanjie, Wuma Road, brought a witness, Chuan Xiangsheng, to the traffic police station to accuse Zhu of stealing a large hemp bag of tin foil worth 150 yuan from the company on the 28th of last month and requested a joint investigation.</p>
<p>Referral to the Court</p>
<p>The traffic police section believed that Wang dared to steal railway joint transportation labels and repeatedly defrauded and stole goods from merchants, seriously disrupting business. Furthermore, after investigating, they found that he had committed the crime with accomplices and that there might be more than two cases. After detailed investigation for several days, Wang still tried to reduce his crime, claiming that he was not the main offender. However, all the plaintiffs identified him without error. Yesterday morning (9th), the section recorded the statements of all parties and sent them, along with the evidence found, to the Shanghai District Court for strict punishment. It is also reported that the goods that Wang defrauded and stole from various companies were stolen in transit on Qiujiang Road and were not goods that the railways had already received, so the railway bureau had no responsibility. Therefore, various companies dare not be careless in handling transportation procedures in the future.</p>
<h3>Musician Ke Zhenghe's Works Popular Everywhere</h3>
<p>Famous musician Ke Zhenghe, professor of the Music Department of Beijing Normal University, has been promoting music for nearly 20 years, sparing no effort.

He is now also starting to edit lectures on world music, a complete collection of world music, and a music dictionary, etc. The plan is ambitious, and when the books are completed in the future, they will surely illuminate the Chinese music scene.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Song Yuntao Law Firm</h3>
<p>Lawyer Song Yuntao is a famous lawyer in Shanghai. Since resigning from the Judicial Section of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau last autumn, he has handled no fewer than two hundred civil and criminal lawsuits and non-litigation matters. Mr. Song is known for his wide circle of friends and his quick and enthusiastic handling of cases, and he has long been trusted by people in society. More than 150 of the city's major factories and merchants have hired Mr. Song as their perennial legal counsel. Notices of appointments have been published in various newspapers. It has now been heard that due to the large number of cases, the lawyer has specially invited lawyers Tao Ran and Xu Lin to cooperate in handling them. Lawyers Tao and Xu have profound legal knowledge and rich experience in handling cases. Now that Mr. Song can get the help of Mr. Tao and Mr. Xu, the so-called union of pearls and jade will be a guarantee for the people, and their benefits will be truly not shallow. It is said that the office is still located at Room 308, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road, telephone number 8940.</p>
<h3>Crowded Reservations for "Records of Births and Deaths of Famous People of Past Dynasties"</h3>
<p>Mr. Qian Baotang from Qinghai Ning, courtesy name Tiejiang, has always been an expert in textual research and is specialized in primary school geography. He has written more than 20 books, which are popular at home and abroad. The book "Records of Births and Deaths of Famous People of Past Dynasties" is a work by the gentleman, who is extremely knowledgeable and has spent his entire life completing it. It is extensive, precise, and can be called unique. Now, his intelligent son, Mr. Jianhong, is proofreading and selling subscriptions. The original deadline was the end of February, but due to the large number of volumes and requests from distant readers, the pre-order period has been extended to the end of March. The entire book is in eight volumes, and the pre-order half price is eight yuan. Shanghai Kaiming Bookstore and Shenzhou Guoguang Society are acting as agents for pre-orders. It is said that about a thousand copies have been ordered so far. To request samples, send a letter to the above two companies, and they will be sent.</p>
<h3>Zhili Plums to be Publicly Distributed</h3>
<p>Zhili plums are of excellent quality and taste the best among all fruits. They are produced in Tongxiang, Zhejiang, and have a long-standing reputation. Those who get them cherish them, because the cultivators are generally old farmers, resulting in a feudal nature and unwillingness to spread them to the outside world. Therefore, those who seek them out of admiration have often been met with cold shoulders. Mr. Gao from the Central Agricultural Experiment Station is extremely concerned about fruit tree horticulture, so he has collected a rich collection of good varieties from China and abroad, and he has always regretted not having Zhili plums. Later, through the introduction of a friend, he met the owner of a Zhili plum garden in that area and spent several years of hard work to obtain true variety grafting buds. He uses the latest scientific methods to engage in propagation and has established a general office at Ermuyuan, Fulili Road, Shanghai, and branch offices at Liuhe Lane, Minquan Road, Liuduqiao, Hankou, to prepare for the public distribution of all the seedlings raised this autumn. Since this news spread, those who know about it have been rushing to place orders with the experimental station.</p>
<h3>Lu Songshun Was Cut en Route</h3>

The assailant, seeing that his goal had been achieved, immediately fled. Western Constable No. 3016 saw him and took him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment by ambulance.

<h3>Publication of "Food Preservation Methods"</h3>
<p>Food is necessary to maintain our lives every day, and its quality is closely related to physical health, so the preservation method must be researched. This is not only an economic issue, but also related to national nutrition. Nowadays, cities are expanding day by day, and human affairs are becoming more and more complex. The transportation and storage of food cannot be as simple as in the past. Mr. Zhang has recognized this, so he compiled the book "Food Preservation Methods". The content is divided into the types of food, the causes of corruption, and preservation methods, described in a total of 16 chapters, based on a scientific standpoint. It is an excellent reference book for food manufacturers, and this knowledge is also essential for military, travel and families. It is said that it has been published and is priced at one yuan, exclusively sold by the Life Bookstore on Sima Road.</p>
<h3>"Healthy World" Sales Active</h3>

The magazine does not hesitate to sacrifice and move forward, striving to enrich the content, combining the advantages of comprehensive pictorials, common sense, sports? Medicine? Beauty? etc., with a unique attitude and beautiful pictures and texts, and the pricing is lower than any other publication. This is truly commendable. Each copy sells for only 6 cents for shipping, and a one-year subscription of 12 issues is 5 jiao including postage in China, 8 jiao for Hong Kong, Macao, and foreign currencies, and 1 yuan for Europe, America, and Nanyang foreign currencies. The price is cheap and the quality is high, so it is welcomed by all sectors and has a large circulation. It is said that there are nearly a hundred letters a day sent to the Shanghai Tongfu Road 214 Lane 14 Kangjian World Society from subscribers, and there are also many people who attach 25 cents in foreign currency to buy back issues 1, 2, 3 (special large) and 4, which is also quite a lot.

<h3>Report of the Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group</h3>
<p>— Respectfully</p>
<p>Organization and Career of Industrial Mission Members</p>
<p>The Guangdong-Guangxi Industrial Inspection Group was sponsored by the China General Confederation of Industry and Commerce. Mr. Wang Zhisheng first made contact in advance and was welcomed by the authorities and local people of Guangdong and Guangxi. The purpose of this trip was to inspect the industry in Guangdong and Guangxi, and to exchange opinions with the industrial circles and authorities of the two provinces in order to achieve mutual cooperation in industry. A total of 36 members joined the group. Mr. Cai Shengbai was elected as the head of the group, and Mr. Xiang Kangyuan and Mr. Hu Xiyuan were his deputies. Before leaving, Mr. Yang Dezhao, the Guangdong provincial representative stationed in Shanghai, hosted a dinner. The reporter talked about the industrial and commercial situation in Guangdong Province. Mr. Yang was very clear. He first said that the silk-producing areas in Guangdong are mainly in Shunde, Nanhai, Zhongshan, and Panyu. Shunde's silkworm cocoons are said to be well-developed, but recently, due to the low price of silk and the influx of foreign goods and rayon, they have been lagging behind. The annual value has fallen from 90 million yuan to several million yuan. The provincial government recognizes the silk industry as one of the province's sources of wealth, so it is doing its best to promote it. The improved breeding grounds have been reduced to ten, and a special bureau has been established to take charge of it. At present, the cost of improving each breeding card is three yuan, but it is only sold to silkworm farmers for one yuan. Academic institutions, such as Zhongda Lingnan and Zhongkai, are all studying the silk industry. Shunde has always been a very promising area for agriculture. Farmers enjoy the pleasure of family wealth by raising fish and pigs, planting mulberry trees, and raising silkworms. Therefore, there is a custom of women not marrying. However, recently, a large number of sweet potatoes, pigs, and cattle from Taiwan have been imported at very low prices. The price of cattle is only more than ten yuan per head, and sweet potatoes only cost five jiao per box (transportation box, the price of each pair is two jiao and five fen), which is very worrying. The sugar industry, in terms of raw materials, is not only encouraging sugarcane farmers to grow sugarcane widely and borrowing money from the Shanghai financial industry, but the provincial government has now established six sugar factories, all of which are very large in scale. In the future, with the completion of the Yuehan Railway and the completion of the Huangpu Commercial Port, the industry in Guangdong Province will have more room for development. The Guangdong Provincial Three-Year Economic Construction Plan will be completed soon. The future plan has been slightly changed. Heavy industry is of course run by the province itself, and light industry will be opened up as much as possible and operated by merchants. The government also intends to implement interest protection and provide loans. At the same time, plans for the propagation and preservation of fruits are also underway, hoping to spread from one province to the whole country, etc. Mr. Yang travels between Shanghai and Guangdong and has extraordinary insights and experience. I greatly admire him. Then, we talked about the currency and tax system issues. Mr. Yang said that it is a pity that the currency system in Guangdong Province has not yet been unified, but this kind of problem seems to be a national issue. There are also various reasons for the collection of taxes. I hope that after arriving in Guangdong, we can earnestly negotiate with each other and there is no worry that there will be no solution. On the evening of the 3rd, all the members of the delegation set off on the President Jefferson. The reporter counted the careers of the 36 members of the delegation as follows: six in the chemical industry, four in the dyeing and weaving industry, three in the electrical appliance industry, two in the machinery industry, two in the enamel industry, two in the pharmaceutical industry, one in the textile industry, one in the silk weaving industry, one in the tobacco industry, one in the bakelite industry, one in the knitting industry, one in the flour industry, one in the rubber industry, one in the cement industry, one in the glue industry, one in the refrigeration industry, one in the paint industry, one in the canning industry, one in the condiment industry, one in the transportation industry, one in the printing industry, and two representatives of national goods groups.</p>
<p>A total of 22 industries, with the chemical industry being the most numerous. Chemists Wu Yun Chu. Fang Yexian and Wu Qingtai all joined the trip. The gathering of talents opened a new era for the Bao Industrial Inspection Group. The members of the ship gathered and made two resolutions. What was discussed was the inspection schedule and the points to pay attention to when visiting, and the grouping inspection was based on their own expertise, which was valuable.</p>

<h3>The Upcoming International Games May Be Postponed Due to Date Conflicts with the National Team's Overseas Trip</h3>
<p>As the weather warms and the track and field season approaches, the annual Shanghai International Track and Field Games, as usual, should be held in May. According to Shen Siliang of the Physical Education Association, this year's international games may be difficult to hold due to a date conflict with the departure of our country's Olympic team. There will likely be little time to hold a competition with Western expatriates before their departure. If the games are held after the team returns from Germany, it may be too cold for track and field competitions. Therefore, this year's international track and field games may be postponed. In any case, a decision must wait until the team returns to Shanghai from Beiping (Beijing) and Tianjin.</p>

<p>North China Daily News Cup</p>
<p>Since the North China Daily News Cup began on December 7th of last year, 26 teams have participated. After four weeks of competition, the quarterfinal week included Yu You, Rex, St. Francis, and Lancashire. Lancashire inherited the spot of the former British Navy team, bringing players to Shanghai, and their strength is far above that of the British Navy team. Yu You met Lancashire in the quarterfinal week and eliminated them with a 1-0 victory. Fortunately, their greatest obstacle has been overcome. St. Francis also eliminated Rex 4-1 last week. In the final week, Yu You will meet St. Francis. Yu You has high hopes for the trophy. The progress of the fierce battles is listed below: (Note) St. Francis defeated Rex 4-1 in the quarterfinals, earning the right to the final.</p>
<p>Junior Cup</p>
<p>This season's Junior Cup also had 26 teams competing. In the third week, Yu You eliminated Tung Wah 3-2, while St. Francis eliminated Qinghua 10-0. At the same time, Weisheng defeated Tongwen 5-2, and the British Navy team crushed the Junior team 14-0, revealing a clear disparity in strength. Subsequently, the British Navy team returned home, and Lancashire took over their spot. By the fourth week of quarterfinals, Weisheng and St. Francis were eliminated by Lancashire and Yu You, respectively, earning the right to the final. Lancashire has an impressive record in Hong Kong and has repeatedly demonstrated its skills since arriving in Shanghai. The clash of these two strong teams in the final promises a fierce battle. However, Yu You recently defeated Lancashire 1-0 in the quarterfinals of the North China Daily News Cup. Based on this, Yu You has high hopes for the trophy. The Junior Cup results are as follows: (Yu You and Lancashire are scheduled for the final this Saturday.) (Note) Lancashire defeated Weisheng 5-2 in the quarterfinals, earning the right to the final.</p>

The two sisters have joined the Taiyuan Ice Skating Association and are diligently practicing ice skating, with great interest. She also mentioned that Shanxi Province paid little attention to winter sports in previous years, but recently, sports enthusiasts have been promoting them. Currently, the ice skating association has more than 100 young male and female members, and its affairs are thriving.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Citywide Soccer Competition: A Preparatory Committee Will Be Established First, and the Competition Will Be Launched Within a Month</h3>
<p>After Mayor Wu of this city initiated a citywide public small-soccer competition and entrusted the Shanghai Small Soccer Association to handle it, the association has been actively proceeding to launch the competition within a month. The association's preparations are outlined below:</p>
<p>Meeting of Cadres: The association was originally organized to participate in the small-soccer performance at the 6th National Games. However, due to its excellent performance, it gained considerable public trust. Therefore, after the Games, President Du continued to maintain it. It has been half a year since then. Mayor Wu of this city has proposed promoting children's sports. After receiving the order to handle it, the association convened a meeting of cadres yesterday to discuss the direction of progress. It was unanimously decided to first establish a preparatory committee to plan all matters.</p>
<p>Abundant Prizes: The citywide small-soccer competition is quite large in scale. Therefore, in addition to receiving a large silver cup from Mayor Wu, the association has also sent letters to the heads of various bureaus and offices of the municipal government to solicit prizes in order to reward the winning teams and increase the interest in competition, thereby achieving the great effect of promotion.</p>
<p>Participation Method: The association has learned from the malpractices of previous competitions. Therefore, this time, the participation method will be resolutely reformed. In addition to a small registration fee, no security deposit will be collected from the registered teams. However, those who forfeit once will be disqualified from the competition. The handling will be earnest in order to uphold sportsmanship and serve as an example for the sports community.</p>
<h3>Results of Yesterday's Soccer Games in Pudong: The Hua Zhi Team Was Found to Have Used a Substitute Player</h3>

<p>Purpose of the Initiative</p>
<p>Fine arts are the vitality of mankind, the repository of national spirit, and the object of national civilization. For thousands of years, our country's national culture has illuminated the world and continued to this day. Since the late modern era, under the impact of European capitalism, people only know how to compete for material possessions, enslaved by things and unable to break free. Trends are declining, and customs are becoming more vulgar. Our brilliant culture with thousands of years of history has been shaken and is in imminent danger. Recognizing that the revival of every nation must first go through a great ideological and artistic movement before it can succeed, as Italy, France, and Germany can attest to? Our country is in a precarious situation. Material civilization is very important, but spiritual civilization must not be ignored. There is also an urgent need for a great ideological movement to reverse the course of history. Therefore, this association is initiated to promote the glory of our country's inherent culture on the one hand and absorb the essence of European culture on the other hand, integrate them to create a new culture that is suitable for the world trend and our country's environment, to be the pioneer of human ideals and to lay the foundation for national civilization.</p>
<p>List of Initiators</p>
<p>Since the launch of the association, people from the art and education circles across the country have enthusiastically participated, including Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Ma Gongyu, Ni Yide, Xie Gongzhan, Lu Fengzi, Xie Haiyan, Liu Yazi, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Heqin, Gu Shusen, Wang Yuanbo, Yan Kechang, Gong Bizheng, Xu Xuangu, Bai Mingzhai, Liu Kang, Zhang Chengjiang, Pan Yuliang, Xiang Peiliang, Chen Renhao, Zheng Yuebo, Wang Yuejian, Zhou Duo, Ge Eryuan, Zheng Wuchang, Zhang Xian, Zhang Chongren, Liu Hairuo, Song Banggan, Wu Mengfei, and more than 100 others.</p>
<p>Scheduled Establishment</p>
<p>The association is scheduled to hold its opening ceremony at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of March 15th. After the ceremony, the meeting will continue to pass the constitution, elect officers, and discuss proposals. Liu Haisu, Wang Jiyuan, Jiang Jianbai, Ma Gongyu, Ni Yide, Xie Haiyan, Yan Kechang, Xie Gongzhan, Xiang Peiliang, Zhang Chengjiang, and Song Banggan have been nominated as officers of the meeting. Preparations are underway, and a grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>

The development of the school has been progressing day by day, and the number of students has been increasing year by year. Various facilities have reached a certain scale.

<h3>Radio School Implements Joint Examination</h3>
<p>Feng Yixian, Director of the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Training School, believes that joint examinations are closely related to the school's soundness and the students' consistent level. However, this method is limited to secondary schools in various provinces and cities. Recently, the number of wireless communication and engineering schools has been increasing. Although the subjects are different, the level is similar to that of secondary schools, and the development of the wireless communication industry has a significant impact on transportation and education. Yesterday, he specially submitted a request to the Education Bureau to forward to the Ministry of Education to implement joint examinations starting this year.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (Part 1) (9) (5)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Dawn listened carefully to each question and answer. His heart leaped with joy at the thought of traveling to a new world with Mr. Hare. He also heard words of praise and recommendation, which made him feel that his recent efforts to live up to his friend's expectations had been rewarded. He was truly moved to tears.</p>
<p>After the gymnastics exercises, Xiaochiao and Tao Mo performed the famous comic play, "Money Makes the Devil Turn the Millstone." Xiaochiao did very well, and Tao Mo played the old farmer excellently, because his imitation of Director Lai made the audience laugh so hard they almost fell over. Even Director Lai himself couldn't stop laughing. Asia even patted him on the back a few times. They were standing in the hall, watching the hilarious play, and felt it was truly very interesting.</p>
<p>Amy waited until she had stopped laughing and could breathe, then went on stage, dressed as a sailor, and sang them a sea song, which included many things about "storms," "sheltered shores," and so on. Finally, everyone sang together, "Hoist the sails, friends, hoist the sails!" The sound shook the whole house. Afterwards, Nada put on a pagoda-pointed hat and performed a unique Chinese dance. Because there had never been any public exhibitions in Meizhuang, there were also some academic performances at this opportunity. The speed with which Xie Ke calculated on the blackboard was enough to astonish the audience. Tao Mo won first place in the spelling competition, and Xiaochiao read a French story so fluently and naturally that Uncle Tanti was very pleased in his heart.</p>
<p>When the curtain fell, everyone asked, "Where did the other little children go?"</p>
<p>At that time, Xiaochiao had already run to his mother's side, preparing to explain when the mystery gradually unfolded, but at this time he only said, "Ah, this is where the surprise comes in. It's really interesting, it's a pity you don't know."</p>

<p>Shen Bao Medical and Pharmaceutical Special Issue</p>
<h3>Overview of the Work of the Jiangsu Provincial Zhenjiang Rural Health Experiment Zone (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>After we arrived in Jianbi, we immediately contacted Liu Yuezhi, the director of the bureau, and all matters related to infant care and health management were handled by our office. Liu expressed great sympathy, and established an infant health experiment office in the bureau. We began to check the physical condition of wet nurses and the health of infants in the nursery. Infants fostered outside were scattered in 71 villages such as Caijia Village, Yinjia Village, and Liaoja Village. We conducted separate investigations, and sent nurses to visit and guide infant care and health knowledge. Those with diseases were treated. On the first, second, and third days of each month, a large number of foster mothers came to the infant receiving office to collect subsidies. We took advantage of the opportunity to give lectures on infant care and hygiene to the foster mothers. The listeners felt that it was relevant to their needs and closely related to themselves, so the effect was great. Physicians and nurses were sent to inspect the infants in the nursery in shifts every day, paying attention to the infants' daily life and the amount of milk fed by the wet nurses. The women who hired wet nurses and received infants had to undergo a physical examination by the physicians in our office. We also provided guidance on the matching and intake of daily nutrients for wet nurses.</p>
<p>B. Epidemic prevention work. 1. Children's vaccination: Vaccination can be carried out in all seasons of the year, but the general public is accustomed to waiting for the spring season to be vaccinated. Children in rural areas rarely have the opportunity to be vaccinated even in the spring season. At the beginning of our office's establishment, we purchased a large number of vaccine seedlings to vaccinate children in rural areas for free, and widely publicized the importance of autumn vaccination. In Jianbi Primary School, various private schools, and villages, a total of more than 500 children came to the clinic for vaccination. 2. Diphtheria prevention vaccination: In the transition between autumn and winter, the weather is dry and diphtheria is prone to spread. In order to prevent it in advance, we purchased a large number of diphtheria toxoids for free vaccination to the people in the township. We also printed a large number of publicity materials for extensive publicity. The Baojia chiefs notified the villagers in advance to receive injections at the office. At the same time, students in Jianbi Primary School were tested with the Schick test. Among the 96 students, 27 had a positive reaction and were given preventive vaccination.</p>
<p>C. Clinic work. In the Zhenjiang rural areas, which have suffered from years of famine and poor medical care, villagers suffer from two kinds of pain when they are sick: 1. They have no money to see a doctor and buy medicine; 2. They cannot find a skilled doctor. Therefore, our clinic work has won their great sympathy. It not only passively relieved many sick people who had no one to turn to, but also used this to connect the feelings of the villagers, making it much easier to promote health care, epidemic prevention, and other work. In four months, the clinic had a total of 3,223 outpatients, 1,173 initial visits, 2,050 return visits, 56 home visits, 25 emergency visits, 45 surgeries, and 295 injections. Among the various diseases, skin diseases were the most common, followed by digestive system diseases and respiratory system diseases.</p>
<p>D. Health education. 1. Mothers' Association. The Mothers' Association is the only group that promotes maternal and infant health and improves family hygiene, and we have received a lot of help. All women who have given birth to infants, regardless of age, are eligible to become members of the Mothers' Association. The association has three directors, who are elected by the members. The directors then elect one executive director to preside over the liaison between the members. Any group of ten members can form an association. Midwives and nurses from our office serve as instructors and hold discussion meetings once a month. 2. Farmer Caregiver Training Class. Take advantage of the farmers' leisure time to hold farmer caregiver training classes. The courses include: 1. Disease prevention methods; 2. Disease care methods; 3. Simple family treatment; 4. Infant care methods; 5. Vaccination methods; 6. Outline of bacteriology; 7. Principles of immunology; 8. Family hygiene; 9. Family entertainment; 10. First aid; 11. Practice. Classes are held for two hours each day and last for three weeks. It is held first in villages with more than 50 households. The first class was held in Xiaocun, and 46 women attended the class, with very few absences. After the completion of the training, a graduates' association was organized to facilitate the connection between the women in the whole village. 3. Family Hygiene Promotion Team. All staff members of our office formed a family hygiene promotion team and adopted a door-to-door promotion method. The promotion standards are divided into three categories: personal hygiene, family hygiene, and public hygiene. In terms of personal hygiene: 1. Do not drink raw water; 2. Do not put fingers into the ear canal or mouth, and do not rub the eyes; 3. Take a bath often; 4. Wash hands before meals and after going to the toilet; 5. Do not visit people with infectious diseases casually; 6. See a doctor for treatment when you are sick; 7. Do not sleep with your head covered; 8. Keep your nails trimmed; 9. Abstain from all bad habits; 10. Know how to get vaccinated. In terms of family hygiene: 1. The house should be ventilated; 2. The house should be cleaned every day; 3. The things in the house should be neat; 4. Clothes should be washed and changed often; 5. Face towels should be separated for each person; 6. Do everything possible to kill animals or insects with infectious diseases (flies, mosquitoes, rats, mad dogs); 7. Pay attention to the cleanliness of the source of drinking water; 8. Parents should supervise the family to get up early; 9. Do not engage in improper entertainment in the family; 10. Do not let children marry too early or too late; 11. Do not let children wear powder, pierce their ears, or bind their chests; 12. Do not keep coffins at home. In terms of public hygiene: 1. Do not wash toilets in the river; 2. Do not defecate or urinate anywhere; 3. Do not spit anywhere; 4. Do not throw away dead livestock anywhere; 5. Do not throw away garbage anywhere; 6. Do not bury coffins in the open air; 7. Notify neighbors if you have an infectious disease. This door-to-door promotion method brings hygiene knowledge to the door and is very effective. 3. Public speeches. The method of public speeches in rural areas is very simple, but the effect is great. We took a gong to a place, and when the gong rang, all the people in the village came. When speaking, the materials were simple and easy to understand, and mixed with various humorous and interesting anecdotes, so the listeners were very happy, and the speakers naturally felt very happy. 4. Masquerade performances. Using theatrical methods to promote hygiene has a deep impression and a great effect. A hygiene education troupe was specially organized. In addition to the staff of our office, students from Jianbi Qianwei Xiegou and other schools who are good at performing also participated. When performing in Qianwei Township, the audience reached 700 or 800 people, which was very popular for a while.</p>
<p>In just four months, we have only done a very small part of the entire plan. However, what we are proud of is that we did not ask the higher authorities for any operating expenses for the expenses incurred in health care, epidemic prevention, and treatment. At the same time, we did not collect donations from local people, but were completely helped and promoted by the people voluntarily. The people benefited from free childbirth and free medical care. The families with a little money all sent money (or things). We used it to buy cowpox vaccine, diphtheria toxoid, and other medicines. Recently, Liu Zhixian, a gentleman from Yuehu Township, donated ten acres and six and five-tenths of a cent of mountain land for our office to build a public platform. It has been reported to the Civil Affairs Department to order a commendation, and is cooperating with the county government to plan and establish a public cemetery. It can be seen that the people have automatically risen to assist in the promotion of health undertakings and are gradually moving towards the road of "health autonomy."</p>
<p>In terms of staff, Yuan Fanghai, Gao Yiliang, section chiefs, doctors, midwives, nurses, etc., are all very hardworking. Everyone wears cloth clothes, eats coarse food, and mingles with the people. I also stipulated that each person should have at least fifty friends who have received help in the countryside. I do the same myself. In the past few months, we have all achieved the ideal of making friends. Tangibly and intangibly, there are hundreds of people who are our helpers, which is of course beneficial to the advancement of the cause.

<h3>Resurrection from the Dead (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Story No. 18—</p>
<p>In addition, in the Connie area, there is a scientist named Professor Wider D. Bancroft, who is working hard to delay the arrival of death. According to him, a simple chemical called Sodium Rhodanate can increase a person's lifespan by at least two years. For people over the age of 45, this drug can prevent the hardening of their nerves and brain tissue, and can also increase their resistance to disease.</p>
<p>However, we have not heard of anything that has truly brought a dead person back to life. Dr. Connashi, encouraged by the success of the experiment on hounds, has gone one step further to attempt this. Currently, he is collecting the corpses of prisoners subjected to poisonous gas as experimental subjects. His plan is this. Move the corpse of the prisoner who has been declared dead by the doctor to the laboratory and tie it to the seesaw board. The second step is to inject a chemical called "methylene blue" into the venous tube to neutralize the poisonous gas. Pure oxygen is pumped into the lungs, and the seesaw board is slowly shaken to keep the blood circulating. The final step is to inject the life-giving liquid into the large vein. This liquid contains mostly fresh human blood and some adrenalin. This drug will cause the heart to contract violently, causing the still heart to beat again. Dr. Connashi is convinced that the dead will definitely come back to life after being injected with this liquid. He does not agree with the opinions of other scientists that the brain tissue of such resurrected people has suffered irreparable damage.</p>
<p>Brain and nerve tissue, unlike other special cells, are destroyed particularly quickly. An American scientist said that brain cells begin to decay immediately after the heart stops working. A French scientist set the time when brain cells begin to decay at 20 minutes after death. Many scientists therefore believe that even if the dead can be resurrected, he will definitely become disabled and useless. Dr. Connashi does not agree with this claim. The evidence he is based on is that the hound he experimented on remained as agile as before after being resurrected.</p>
<p>The method used by Dr. Connashi was unintentionally laid the foundation by a London doctor in 1855. This doctor's name is Dr. Thomas Addison, a doctor at the British Royal Hospital. He devoted himself to discovering a way to treat a strange disease. This strange disease—later called "Addison's disease"—affects the heart, causing the skin to turn copper-colored, and the pulse to be weak and irregular. Addison discovered that this disease was due to a lack of secretion from the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are one of the human body's ductless glands, two inches long, located on the upper part of the kidneys. The secretory fluid of these adrenal glands, which was little known at the time, has a strange effect on the heart and blood vessels.</p>
<p>Since Addison announced this discovery, adrenal gland extracts have also been successfully manufactured by researchers. It was discovered that this extract also has a hemostatic function, so it is often used as an important drug in surgical medical rooms. However, this extract is difficult to last for a long time; it immediately loses its effectiveness when it comes into contact with air. Therefore, many scientists have devoted themselves to refining the elements of the adrenal glands, and the one who finally succeeded was the Japanese scientist Dr. Jokichi Takamine.</p>
<p>The element of the adrenal glands that has been successfully refined is a crystalline powder, white in color and bitter in taste. Its inventor named it adrenaline. This Japanese scientist passed away in 1922. At that time, he never dreamed that the adrenaline he had successfully manufactured would eventually accomplish an amazing miracle. It was not until 1923 that this miracle appeared in St. Louis Hospital in New York.</p>
<h3>Common Sense Questions about Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(79) Anemia (Continued)</p>
<p>Are there any abnormalities in the urine excreted by anemic patients?</p>
<p>The urine of anemic patients is large in quantity and transparent. The amount of urine excreted each day is 1.5 liters to 2 liters. The specific gravity is 1015-1021. Sometimes protein is found in the urine.</p>
<p>What changes will occur in the internal organs of people with severe anemia?</p>
<p>The heart, kidneys, blood vessels, etc. will all undergo fatty degeneration; especially the changes in blood vessels are more severe, and it is easy to bleed or moisture is easy to seep out, so edema or polyuria occurs.</p>
<p>Is the body temperature of anemic patients different from that of ordinary people?</p>
<p>In cases of severe anemia, fever occurs, with a temperature of 38.5 degrees Celsius to 39 degrees Celsius seen in the evening every day.</p>
<p>What is the reason for fever during anemia?</p>
<p>Because there are toxic protein bodies in the blood.</p>
<p>Is the number of red blood cells in the blood of anemic patients reduced?</p>
<p>Except for anemia caused by acute blood loss, the number of red blood cells in the blood is probably reduced by about 20%. That is, each cubic millimeter contains about 4 million.</p>
<p>Is the proportion of hemoglobin also reduced?</p>
<p>The amount of hemoglobin is also reduced by 40% to 50%.</p>
<p>Are there any changes in white blood cells in the blood of anemic patients?</p>
<p>There are generally no changes in white blood cells.</p>
<p>What is the prognosis of this disease, good or bad?</p>
<p>Generally good. As long as the cause is removed, it will gradually return to normal.</p>
<p>How to diagnose anemia?</p>
<p>First check the cause of the disease, then refer to what is seen in the blood; at the same time, check the stool for parasite eggs, and then the diagnosis can be confirmed.</p>
<p>What is the proper way to treat this secondary anemia?</p>
<p>The first is to treat the original disease. Use arsenic and iron preparations internally or by injection. Then use liver preparations internally or by injection. Eating liver (beef and pork liver) every day is also effective.</p>
<p>Children often suffer from anemia. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>The causes of anemia in children are nothing more than prolonged breastfeeding, nutritional disorders, frequent consumption of milk substitutes, abnormal physique, lack of vitamin foods, or congenital syphilis or tuberculosis, or parasites in the intestines.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of anemia in children?</p>
<p>Children with anemia have yellowish skin, no blood color in their cheeks, enlarged spleen, and the blood findings are similar to those of secondary anemia in adults; however, white blood cells are increased.</p>
<p>What is the treatment for anemia in children?</p>
<p>The treatment of anemia in children should focus on diet therapy, eating more vegetables and fruits containing vitamins, and liver. In addition, they should often be in places with plenty of sunlight and fresh air, or irradiated with artificial sun lamps. Sometimes blood transfusion therapy is performed. Arsenic and iron preparations can also be used, but caution should be taken.</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(19) Sunflower Heliauthus Aununs, L.</p>

<h3>Tooth Knowledge Q&amp;A (23)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 112) How should children who like to eat sweets protect their teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Teach him to brush his teeth every time after eating to wash away the remaining food debris. At least, he must rinse his mouth a lot to rinse away the residue.</p>
<p>(Question 113) What should children pay attention to during the period of changing teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Milk teeth should not be extracted early before the time of changing teeth to avoid uneven growth of adult teeth, which are prone to decay. However, when it is time to change, and they feel very wobbly, they should be extracted immediately, and they must not be left in place to hinder the growth of adult teeth; otherwise, the adult teeth will inevitably be uneven and prone to decay.</p>
<p>(Question 114) Should the upper and lower alveolar ridges of children be straightened when they are uneven?</p>
<p>Answer: If there are irregularities in the upper and lower alveolar ridges, it is not only unsightly, but also occludes unevenly, and it is easy to cause cavities, so you should ask a dentist to correct them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(Question 115) Does the protection of milk teeth require the help of a dentist?</p>
<p>Answer: Even if children pay attention to oral hygiene and protect their teeth at all times, they may still develop cavities. These cavities are usually very small, painless, and cannot be found by themselves. It is best to ask a dentist to check them once every six months, and if there are any cavities, they can be repaired immediately to avoid them getting bigger and bigger. Nowadays, in many foreign schools, children are under the strict supervision and guidance of dentists, who pay considerable attention to their oral hygiene methods and diet, and regularly check their teeth and record them in forms, which can be consulted at any time. It is said that people who are under such supervision have better teeth and are rarely incomplete in adulthood.</p>
<p>(Question 116) Are there any simple methods that can be used to prevent the erosion of milk teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Silver nitrate can be used to apply to the occlusal surface of the milk teeth every six months. That is, after the first and second permanent molars have grown, they can also be applied together. Even if children are around ten years old, if they feel that there is a tendency for cavities, it is also appropriate to use this medicine to apply to the surface of all teeth once a year or every six months. After the application, try to make the silver precipitate. If there is a place where cavities are starting, it will be dyed black. The larger the cavities, the deeper the coloring. Therefore, this method can not only curb the progress of cavities, but also discover small cavities that are not easily detected by ordinary means.</p>
<h3>Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Disease Hygiene Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(80) Eczema and Frostbite of the Auricle</p>
<p>Auricular Eczema: Auricular eczema mostly occurs in children. Its causes can be divided into three categories: When suffering from chronic otorrhea, the flowing pus can often irritate the auricle, causing eczema. It can also be secondary to eczema of the head. Drug irritation from substances such as iodoform, mercuric chloride, aluminum acetate, lead sugar, and boric acid can also cause eczema. This disease has a tendency to repeatedly recur in patients with glandular diathesis. Its common sites are generally the opening of the external auditory canal and its vicinity, the hollows between the auricle's convolutions, and the folds between the auricle and the mastoid process.</p>
<p>The symptoms of auricular eczema are generally the same as those of common skin eczema. Patients feel itchy. The skin of the auricle becomes red and moist. Crusts or pustules may also form, or the epidermis may peel off. Painful swelling or suppuration often occurs in the lymph nodes behind the ear or in the superficial cervical lymph nodes. The treatment for auricular eczema requires, first and foremost, addressing the underlying cause. Chronic otorrhea or eczema of the head should be treated first, and drug irritation should be avoided. The rest of the treatment is the same as for common skin eczema.</p>
<p>Auricular Frostbite: In the severe winter and early spring, we often inevitably suffer from frostbite. The most easily affected parts are the hands, feet, and auricles. Its pain is unbearable. The most easily frostbitten part of the auricle is the upper posterior margin of the helix. Mild frostbite only causes loss of sensation in the helix due to vasoconstriction. Moderate frostbite causes itching or pain due to vasoparalysis. Severe frostbite can cause blisters or ulcers, and even lead to gangrene.</p>
<p>Prevention of auricular frostbite involves protecting the auricle and avoiding cold air exposure. As for its treatment, it is generally the same as for frostbite of the hands and feet.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (84)</h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 8 Surgical Treatment</p>
<p>The adoption of surgical treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis is undoubtedly a major advancement in modern treatment! In the initial stages, the indications were not fully understood, and the surgical methods were not entirely appropriate. Therefore, according to recent clinical reports, on average, at least fifteen out of one hundred patients undergo surgical treatment. Among these patients who have undergone surgery, roughly two-thirds can achieve considerable results. This figure is, of course, relative and limited, far from being as effective as diphtheria antitoxin in treatment. However, even considering this partial success, its greatness in benefiting humanity is worthy of praise!</p>
<p>What is surgical treatment? What principle is it based on? We know that if people's lungs are compressed by external pressure, their tissues can become atrophic. Based on clinical observations, patients with this disease often have natural pneumothorax or exudative pleurisy, and their lung tissue is often in a compressed state. The prognosis of these cases is mostly better than others. Based on this principle, in modern treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, "artificial pneumothorax" surgery has been adopted! It involves injecting an appropriate amount of air into the patient's chest cavity. At this time, the alveoli are compressed, blood flow stagnates, and the lungs cannot easily expand during breathing. Indirectly, it makes it difficult for lesions within the lung tissue to spread, and the healthy tissues are also compressed by the air, and the stagnation of blood flow can promote the proliferation of new connective tissue. The lesion can also be healed by scarring. Even cavities in the lungs can be healed by scarring. Therefore, although this surgical treatment is clearly not the bactericidal specific therapy we dream of, it promotes scarring of the lesion and the proliferation of connective tissue around the lesion, ultimately leading the patient towards recovery. We can boldly say that this clinical result achieves the same effect as an ideal bactericidal specific therapy.</p>
<p>What types of cases are suitable for artificial pneumothorax surgery? First, we must understand that most patients who need artificial pneumothorax surgery are severely ill. For mild cases of this disease, it is not necessary, with the exception of early cavities. In terms of the nature of the disease, the proliferative type is most suitable, followed by the proliferative-exudative type. The purely exudative type mostly yields poor results. In summary, its most suitable type is severe, progressive, proliferative, and unilateral disease. It is also deemed necessary for patients with cavities! In addition, for patients with recurrent hemoptysis, if the lesion is unilateral, it is also one of the most suitable indications. Patients can generally be saved from danger. Regarding lesions limited to one side or spread to both sides, doctors previously believed that artificial pneumothorax surgery was completely impossible for bilateral disease. Doctors must be completely clear about a unilateral case before proceeding. Now, the scope of indications has gradually expanded. Even for tuberculosis in both lungs, surgery can sometimes be performed! This is worth reporting! As for complications such as intestinal tuberculosis, spondylitis, bilateral kidney tuberculosis, emphysema, asthma, severe diabetes, severe nephritis, and valvular heart disease, as well as patients who are excessively weak, artificial pneumothorax surgery is very unsuitable and falls into the category of contraindications. In addition, conditions like laryngeal tuberculosis and unilateral kidney tuberculosis are not absolute contraindications. If the ulceration in the larynx is not severe, and the general condition of patients with kidney tuberculosis is still good, surgery can still be performed.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Bar Premiums Drop Sharply</h3>
<p>Deteriorating Franco-German Situation Drives Silver Prices Up Three Times</p>
<p>Result: a Retreat of $5.60; Gold Exchange Closed on the 12th</p>
<p>The gold market rose significantly yesterday due to the worsening situation between France and Germany, breaking through the $50 mark upon opening. It remained relatively stable mid-session, but unexpectedly, silver prices rose a total of 30 annas in three increments, leading to a sharp decline. Initially, overseas silver markets showed a rise in London and stability in the US, with forward silver prices in Monterrey rising by 2 cents and 5 haos respectively. London spot gold remained unchanged, but exchange rates contracted due to the French franc's situation. The Central Bank's posted rates remained unchanged for both the British pound and the US dollar, and the gold unit of the customs duty also remained unchanged. The standard gold bar premium was still posted at $1146.90. Pre-market trading opened with low spirits due to the deterioration of the Franco-German situation. The Fuxing, Yongding, and Kang sold bars, dropping from $51 to within $50. The morning opening was low, but large buyers took advantage of the low prices and gradually stabilized the market, rising to above $50 briefly, but sellers also became active at the high prices and soon the market retreated again. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced that the British pound and the US dollar remained unchanged. The market then fluctuated, but selling pressure was stronger, and buyers also took profits. The silver balance tax rose by one cent, but this was not enough to sustain the market. Although there was a rebound later, confidence was not unified, and the market remained weak at noon. The afternoon market opened peacefully and fluctuated. Although there was a brief rise, it failed to break through the $50 mark and soon declined. The market was extremely calm mid-session, but unexpectedly, silver prices rose twice, totaling 27 to 28 annas, triggering selling pressure. Buyers frantically sold off, and prices fell steadily. Although large buyers stepped in after the close, the market remained weak due to a third silver price increase of 3 annas. Swap rates were posted by buyers at $2.30 yesterday. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $1149.80, a decrease of $2.40 from last Saturday. Futai, Heng, Chunyuan, Yongda, Decheng, and Yicheng bought bars, rising from $9.50 to $50.80.

<h3>Fluctuations in British and American Exchange Rates; Shanghai Banks Arbitrage British and American Exchange</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market hardened yesterday due to the rise in silver prices, and interbank trading of British and American exchange rates was quite active. Early in the morning, external telegraphic transfers showed London spot prices up by 25, forward prices up by 1.875, the New York silver market unchanged, forward silver prices in Monterrey down by 2 cents and up by 5 haos, spot gold in London unchanged, the pound sterling against the US dollar down by 375, the pound sterling against the French franc down by 9 points, the US dollar against the pound sterling down by half a cent, and the US dollar against the French franc down by 2.5 cents, possibly due to the worsening situation between Germany and France. The Central Bank's posted rates showed no change for both the pound sterling and the US dollar, and the gold unit of the customs duty also remained unchanged. The morning opening of the foreign exchange market showed spot selling prices for the pound sterling at 1 shilling 2 pence 4.375, and the US dollar at 30 yuan, representing a decrease of 0.03125 for the pound sterling and 0.0625 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday. After the opening, bank appetites differed, and the market remained stable. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced that the pound sterling and the US dollar remained unchanged. The market then became stable due to arbitrage of foreign exchange by Chinese merchant banks. The silver balance tax rose by one cent, but because Chinese merchants lacked activity, buying interest subsided. Thereafter, there were only foreign exchange arbitrage sales, and there were no special changes. The afternoon market remained peaceful due to foreign exchange arbitrage by banks. Later, silver prices rose twice, totaling 27 and 28 annas, and confidence became weak. Supply exceeded demand, but there was not much trading, and the trend hardened. The closing prices were 1 shilling 2 pence 0.5 for the pound sterling and 30 yuan 0.0625 for the US dollar, representing a decrease of 0.09375 for the pound sterling and an increase of 0.125 for the US dollar compared to last Saturday. The forward market was also the same. Chinese merchants lacked activity, and banks worked hard to arbitrage British and American foreign exchange, but there was also a lack of special interest. The day's transaction prices are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Also Affected by German Treaty Violation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was weak, and trading did not pick up, as the European situation, with the extraordinary actions of the German army, became increasingly grim and tense, with the potential for an imminent explosion. Its indirect impact on East Asian peace was also very close. Market sentiment was slightly weak, and selling pressure was relatively high, but because trading was not high, the rising trend was extremely slow, and the overall trend declined throughout the day. In the exchange, most brokers who went long were optimistic, while retail investors and those holding spot goods were mostly bearish. Large transactions were completely stagnant, partly due to market prices and partly due to the perception that it was not the right time. The first session of trading yesterday was relatively lively, with more selling from the northern brokers, and some buying of Number 4 bonds. The Ding-type bonds remained largely unchanged. The second session continued to weaken, and Numbers 14, 35, and 32 continued to be heavily sold, generally declining by about 1 jiao. The trend was clear, and the market weakened. In the afternoon opening and closing sessions, Number 47 was mostly sold, Number 4 was bought, and the Bing-type bonds were the most active. Number 11 was also sold significantly, so the first session in the afternoon declined by about 1 jiao. The closing still showed no improvement, with only the Bing-type Number 4 bond rising by 2 jiao, fluctuating constantly, still brewing and waiting for changes in the situation. The resulting market prices generally declined by 2 to 3 jiao, with the Ding-type bond declining by 7.5 jiao, a significantly larger decline, and 96 also declining by 4 to 5 jiao. The total number of transactions was 3,155,000 yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are listed in a comparative table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Speculation Adopted a Cautious Approach; US Stocks Showed Loosening</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (7th), the New York stock market showed mixed results. Military stocks rose sharply due to Germany's occupation of the Rhineland, with aircraft stocks rising the most, reaching 8 yuan. Chemical and steel stocks also rebounded from low prices. Other parts of the market saw cautious trading due to speculators adopting a cautious approach, and trading was relatively light. Small exchange stocks showed loosening. In the bond market, both foreign and domestic government bonds fell. Half-day trading totaled 1.47 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: News Favored Bulls; Yarn and Cotton Prices Rose Sharply</h3>
<p>Yarn Prices Rose by $2.89; Cotton Also Reached a New Peak</p>
<p>The yarn market trended firm, and the rising trend gradually started, with rising cotton industries overseas and the European situation, which the market said favored buyers. At the same time, Three Products cotton yarn rose sharply, morale was boosted, and buying interest was strong. Changfeng continued to pull in, and market prices moved forward. This month's prices broke through the $200 mark.</p>
<p>Changfeng Bought Large Amounts of Standard Yarn</p>
<p>At the opening of the early market, prices rose across all months, because Three Products yarn rose step by step, morale was boosted, and Changfeng again bought in large quantities. The market became increasingly tight, and the result was that prices rose by $1.3 to $1.7.8 compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, there was lively spot yarn business, raw cotton rose sharply, and Changfeng continued to buy, with market prices advancing steadily. The result was that prices rose by $0.5.9 to $1.4 compared to the morning closing price. 1,250 bales of Deda were sold, 1,600 bales of Chengji, 1,800 bales of Tongji, 1,500 bales of Dafeng, 1,050 bales of Jinchang, 1,850 bales of Gengfeng, 2,400 bales of Shenji, 550 bales of Gu Da, 1,050 bales of Yuan Yi, and 1,000 bales of Renfeng. 1,900 bales were bought by Dafu, 800 bales by Daji, 1,700 bales by Hexing, 1,100 bales by Dachangcheng, 5,850 bales by Changfeng, 2,250 bales by Runkang, 1,550 bales by Tonghe, 800 bales by Dachang, and 1,100 bales by Yichang, 650 bales by Xiecheng.

<p>Spot Yarn Rose by $1.2 or More</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were smooth and showed signs of improvement. According to statistics, all gangs traded a total of 1,790 bales throughout the day, with selling prices rising by $1.2 or more. The purchase amounts for each gang are listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton market soared, and the situation was sharp, because the Indian and American cotton markets all soared, and Osaka's Three Products cotton rose by $0.6.7 to $1. This led to buying activity, floating profit offsets, and both buyers and sellers advanced side by side. Market prices reached new peaks since the end of last year.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Soared in All Months</p>
<p>At the opening of the early market for standard cotton, prices jumped across all months. The opening situation was extremely serious. Because the news favored buyers, Osaka's Three Products cotton soared by $0.7.8, American cotton rose by 2 to 15 points, and Indian cotton rose by $0.75 to $1.5 rupees. This led to a buying frenzy, and Mingde again pulled in, causing market prices to race wildly. The result was that prices rose by $0.45 to $0.6.7.85 compared to the previous day's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon market, black market news from India predicted that prices would soar by $4.75 rupees tomorrow. Morale was even hotter, but Daji suddenly made efforts to sell off 15,000 dan, and the prices in the second session were suppressed, but Changhe and Runkang frantically bought empty orders, and the trend reversed and rose again. When the hand towel was smooth, the result was that prices rose by $0.15 to $0.2 compared to the morning closing price. 15,200 dan of Daji were sold, 2,000 dan of Deda, 94,000 dan of Chengji, 2,900 dan of Jinchang, 9,500 dan of Gengfeng, 8,500 dan of Shenji, 2,500 dan of Gu Da, 2,800 dan of Dachangcheng, 3,700 dan of Dachang, 7,200 dan of Xincheng, 2,500 dan of Tongji, and 2,100 dan of Yichang. 3,200 dan were bought by Shengyuan, 5,900 dan by Dafu, 4,900 dan by Yu Da, 3,500 dan by Dafeng, 6,500 dan by Mingde, 3,400 dan by Zhenda, 3,100 dan by Yongda, and 4,900 dan by Yuanxingchang. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Turned Silent</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption turned silent due to high prices. Holders quoted too high prices, making it difficult for both parties to reach an agreement. There were no sources to speak of.</p>
<h3>High Indian Cotton Prices Led to Cotton Merchants Short Selling</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the cotton market was weak due to overseas weakness, and large quantities of Gojra cotton were moved, the trend was weak. Later, Japanese politics stabilized and prices rebounded, but the high market prices led to short selling by futures traders and cotton merchants. Japan and China were interested in White Row Creek cotton at low prices, and Far Eastern demand expanded. Europe was even more smooth. Indian yarn mills were wary due to poor inquiries about textiles. An appendix of last week's statistics is as follows (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<h3>Mumbai Yarn Prices Were Weak</h3>
<p>Compared to Last Week</p>
<p>20 count: 8 annas, down 0.5 annas</p>
<p>10 count: 5.5 annas, unchanged</p>

<h3>Local Cotton Inventory Decreased Significantly</h3>
<p>Survey on March 7</p>
<h3>Appendix: Foreign Cotton Inventory Statistics</h3>
<h3>Foodstuffs: Germany's Abrogation of Treaty Actually Causes Large-Scale Speculation in Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>If war breaks out in Europe, the export of oil beans and sesame seeds will certainly be impacted, while the import of foreign wheat into China will be hindered. Wheat flour, oil beans, bean cakes, and sesame seeds will all rise in price.</p>
<p>Prices of standard oil beans, bean cakes, and sesame seeds in various cities all soared yesterday. Although there was no large-scale purchasing by customers or foreign firms, the market sentiment was universally optimistic. This was because Dalian telegrams had repeatedly indicated good prices. Given reports that German troops were on the move, the possibility of war breaking out in Europe seemed imminent. Speculative buying suddenly surged in the market. According to Dalian telegrams, there was also speculative buying by certain parties in that region. In Shanghai, in addition to the rush to buy at floating profits, there was also speculation from outside the industry. The general consensus was that if war broke out in Europe, there would definitely be a large outflow of oil beans and sesame seeds to foreign firms. Moreover, current arrivals were not plentiful, and local sales were still active, with a solid foundation. Therefore, prices rose for all near and distant months. Foreign sesame seeds rose sharply by 1.80 yuan per dan (unit of volume), standard beans rose sharply by 1.10 yuan per dan, near-term oil rose by nearly 4 yuan, and long-term oil rose by 6-7 yuan.</p>
<p>The yellow bean market situation was such that spot soybean oil was extremely scarce, and the market was tense. Moreover, bean cake sales were brisk and active, with all factories producing over 40,000 pieces of various brands of cake, and the market price suddenly looked promising. Therefore, the raw materials for oil cake were able to continue to thrive. Yesterday, the market saw the Luohe Bean Factory dispatch 2,000 bags at a price of 5.10 yuan. The Quanzhou merchants transacted 100 bags at a price of 5.03 yuan. Furthermore, the Bengbu Bean Factory acquired 400 bags, and the Zhumadian Bean Factory acquired 300 bags. In addition, they ordered seven cartloads of Tongliao beans from the inland route at a price of 5 yuan. The Shantou and Xiamen merchants were actively purchasing sand yellow and Du beans from this street, with a total of 2,600 bags transacted. The price of high-grade sand yellow had reached 5 yuan, and the price of high-quality Du beans had also increased by 3-4 fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, there was a consistent positive trend. Foreign wheat quotations showed gains of 3-5 jiao in Chicago and around 4 jiao in Canada. Market sentiment was nervous due to the changing situation in Europe, and there was a belief that war might break out. Therefore, near-term customers were pulling in stock, and long-term speculative buyers from outside the industry were aggressively buying in, resulting in a greater increase. By the afternoon opening, the market sentiment for the current month turned stable due to factories selling off their holdings. However, due to concerns about the uncertainty of future foreign wheat prices, the buying interest in new flour starting from June remained strong, and market prices continued to increase by 2 fen. As a result, near-term prices rose by 1-2 fen, and long-term prices rose significantly by 4-5 fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for all months rose sharply. Foreign wheat quotations rebounded by around 3-5 jiao. Furthermore, due to the European crisis and fears of future expansion, the general sentiment was that foreign wheat might not be available for purchase. Therefore, the opening price for the current month remained relatively stable, while trading in the long-term was very active, and prices also rose sharply by as much as 7-8 fen. The majority of buyers consisted of outside-industry speculators, while those in the industry mostly sold out. By the afternoon opening, arrivals for the current month were very few, while trading in the long-term remained brisk, with large fluctuations. Observing future trends will depend on international developments. Trading in the current wheat market was not active, with only 900 bags transacted. Shandong wheat was priced at 5.23 yuan, and Tiantai wheat was priced at 5.20 yuan, acquired by the Fu, Fu, and Shen companies.</p>
<h3>The Hakka Xian Rice Market is Apparently Loose but Actually Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's arrivals of Hakka xian rice continued from Jiujiang, Xiangyin and other ports, with over 10,000 bags reportedly arriving in two days. However, sales were weak. The Jiangxi early and late indica rice, which various merchants had been vying for in recent days, only saw some response from merchants on this street and from Nanjing and Quanzhou. Apart from hoarders acquiring 1,000 bags of Han rough rice, the rest remained on the sidelines. Only 86 bags of rough red rice were sold inland. With hoarding being stagnant and arrivals abundant, market prices immediately plummeted, especially for Jiangxi late indica, which fell sharply by 2 jiao, with other varieties falling by about 1 jiao. However, most cargo owners planned to hold on and not sell, while a few hoarders planned to wait for a small rebound before selling. Therefore, the market became apparently tight again in the afternoon. A total of 3,000 bags of Jiangxi late indica, 1,086 bags of Xiangyin and other rough rice, and 300 bags of Taizhou rice were transacted throughout the day.</p>
<h3>The Thin Indica Rice Market Shows Slight Weakness</h3>
<p>Yinbianyuan Increases by 4-5 Fen</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, nearly 40 merchants sourced from near and far (totaling over 8,000 shi), with thin indica rice accounting for the majority. Therefore, although the Qing, Yan and Wei merchants acquired 3,000 bags, the thin indica market turned soft, and prices fell slightly by 7 fen. Sales of thick early japonica rice were balanced on this street, so prices remained stable. Du Yangjian and Yinbianyuan were unaffected.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, about 32-33 merchants sourced from the river areas. Trading in various commodities was normal. White japonica rice was stable, thin indica rice saw some sales, and prices were relatively tight. Custom pointed rice saw some activity, and prices increased by several fen. Yinbianyuan also increased by 4-5 fen. Prices of other commodities showed signs of tightening.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Stockpile is 100,000 Bales</h3>
<p>New York's February raw silk consumption was 32,053 bales, a decrease of 6,942 bales compared to January, and the lowest record since July 1934's 32,021 bales, indicating a decrease in raw silk consumption. In terms of Japanese silk, the domestic silk stockpile is still 21,387 bales, a decrease of 3,923 bales compared to the same period last year, and a decrease of 892 bales compared to last month. The New York silk stockpile is 10,952 bales, an increase of 10,088 bales compared to the same period last year, and an increase of 8,282 bales compared to February. There are 24,400 bales in transit, a decrease of 9,900 bales compared to the previous year, and a decrease of 13,800 bales compared to January. In total, there are 101,759 bales, a decrease of 5,735 bales compared to the same period last year, and a decrease of 6,405 bales compared to last month.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Sugar Price Drops by About 4 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was firm due to tighter customs gold. The guild's quoted prices were 22.30 yuan for spot coarse granulated white sugar and 7.10 yuan for transit goods, but no transactions were made due to shortages. There were no changes in East Red White or local cotton white sugar. Brokers offered 100 bags of Hainan red sugar at 12.53 yuan, but the price fell by about 4 jiao due to sluggish sales in the north. In addition, Xinghua brokers offered several hundred bags of Da Gong powdered white sugar at 19 yuan, and Jian brokers offered 60 boxes of standard Five Blessings white rock candy at 18.80 yuan per base, with the existing stock exhausted and the next batch awaiting arrival.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Cooperative Company held its bidding and exchange period yesterday, and the prices of various grades remained the same. However, Guangdong medium granulated white sugar rose by 5 fen but no transaction was made. A total of 434 bags of Five Rams coarse white sugar were transacted at 22.10 yuan, 120 bags of Qu Xi coarse white sugar were transacted at 21.90 yuan, 170 bags of No. 2 Five Rams fine white sugar were transacted at 21.10 yuan, and No. 4 was transacted at 20.90 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Sichuan Black Fungus Rises Again by 5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the trend of black fungus has been tight, with active sales in the north. Sichuan fungus opened at 120 yuan, up another 5 yuan. Yichang fungus also reached 102 yuan. Therefore, there are signs of a further rise in the market.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: 918 Serge Rises by About 1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen fabric trading was very active, but sales were slightly sluggish due to the cold weather. Sales of domestic children's Hua Mianyang Group 918 thin plain serge were strong among local merchants. Greenish-blue, evergreen, and yellow were even more popular. The factory's output was far from meeting demand. This was because the quality was solid and the price was cheaper than Eastern goods. In addition, the military, government, and academic circles all specified that domestic Yuan color serge should be worn. Therefore, although the color was dim, market sales were still broad, and selling prices rose instead. Previously, 918 plain serge was only sold for 2.65 yuan per yard, but now it has risen to 2.80 yuan across the board.</p>
<h3>Metals: Spot French Tinplate is About to Run Out</h3>
<p>Black Sheet Iron New Arrivals</p>
<p>French tinplate has recently been sought after by toy factories and can factories, and standard prices have had to be raised due to the prevailing environment. Currently, 180-pound boxes are sold for 36.50 yuan each, and 200-pound boxes are sold for 39 yuan each.</p>
<p>The market for black sheet iron is also improving due to the small amount of stock available. However, a new batch of goods arrived yesterday, unloaded and bundled at the North Wharf of the Business Bureau, and sold for 8.75 yuan per bundle, which is 2-3 jiao higher than before.</p>
<h3>Finance in the Past Year (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>— He Boxiong</p>
<p>4. Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>China's exchange market is centered in Shanghai, so fluctuations in silver prices are reflected in Shanghai first. The following table summarizes the relationship between overseas silver prices and Shanghai exchange rates in recent years to provide a glimpse. (Note 4)</p>
<p>Attached: Table of Silver Price and Exchange Rate Fluctuations in Recent Years</p>
<p>Notes: New York silver prices are in US cents per ounce, London silver prices are in pence per ounce, New York exchange rates are in US dollars per 100 silver yuan, London exchange rates are in pence per silver yuan, and silver surplus and deficit are in yuan.</p>
<p>Since the 21st year, exchange rates for British and American currencies have gradually risen along with the increase in overseas silver prices. By May of the 24th year, the British exchange rate had risen to 20.125 pence, and the American exchange rate had risen to 40.971 US dollars. If the American exchange rate in the 21st year is taken as 100, then the exchange rate in the 22nd year actually increased by 21.51%, the exchange rate in the 23rd year actually increased by 57.22%, and the exchange rate in May of last year actually increased by 90.22%. Although the exchange rate increased so much, it still lagged behind the increase in silver prices. The silver price in New York in the 22nd year was 22.28% higher than in the 21st year, the silver price in the 23rd year was 69.12% higher than in the 21st year, and the silver price in May of the 24th year was 162.74% higher than in the 21st year. The exchange rates for British and Japanese currencies were generally the same as for American currency. The rise in silver prices was so rapid, and China's international balance of payments was in a negative situation, so silver flowed out in large quantities. The surplus in the 21st year was over 10 million yuan, which increased to over 14 million yuan in the 22nd year. By the end of the 23rd year, the silver surplus had reached over 254 million yuan. This was all because overseas silver prices were far higher than the increase in China's foreign exchange, creating a difference, and thus creating opportunities for profit. Actual silver was then continuously transported to Britain and the United States. Since January of last year, silver has had a surplus of 1-2 million yuan each month. This is because a large amount of silver had already flowed out domestically, leading to a depleted reserve. The Price Stabilization Committee then sold cash and purchased silver to adjust the market. Looking at the cash import and export statistics table from January to June of last year (there were no imports or exports from July to October), the large surplus of gold can be seen.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Yi Zhi)</p>
<p>The knowledge that young people need now must be able to critically assess "whether," otherwise, it will be as useless as being blind. It is also impossible to be a warrior in a dark society.</p>
<p>Some people say: A person's self-confidence should not be too strong. Yes, a person's wisdom is limited. Although a person is usually very smart, there are many times when they will become a first-rate fool and do things that are more foolish than anyone else.</p>
<p>"Smart for a lifetime, foolish for a moment." The great Newton also made many mistakes, and his friends and servants pointed them out to him! So, is the intelligent Newton not as good as his servant?</p>
<p>From this point of view, a person's self-confidence should indeed not be too strong, because sometimes your thoughts will also be wrong, and things will also be done wrong. If you only deeply believe in yourself, it is also unreliable.</p>
<p>In short, self-confidence should not be too strong, nor can it be absent. It is best to think three times before acting.</p>
<h3>Talking about Leap Months</h3>
<p>— Aimei</p>
<p>February of this year in the Western calendar has 29 days, which is a leap year. I suppose that at the beginning of setting the calendar, there may not have been a scientific basis, so the construction of the months, the remainder of the year, and the intercalary days were all based on rigid formulas. However, the ancient calendar of our country is not like that. In its method of calculation, it studies the heavens above and infers the earth's atmosphere below. Ordinary people only say that it is calculated according to the movements of the sun and moon, but that does not fully explain its principles.</p>
<p>Taking just the leap month system as an example, according to the Zuo Zhuan Commentary: "The month combines with the monthly node. Each month combines with one day. All remaining days are returned to the end, forming a month, which is then placed as a leap month." Also, Ban Gu's Bai Hu Tong says: "The Zhou sky has 365 and a quarter degrees. The year has twelve months. The sun passes twelve degrees per month, so there is one leap month every three years and another addition every five years, clarifying that yin is insufficient and yang is surplus." This is indeed an explanation of why leap months are set, and everyone knows it. However, Lu Ji's Theory of the Celestial Sphere says: "The leap month has no middle energy, and the Big Dipper points obliquely between two zodiacal signs, so it is different from other months." This means that the calendar is related to the stars in addition to the sun and moon, so there is such a response in the year of the leap month!</p>
<p>As for the signs corresponding to the Earth's atmosphere, flowers and trees can all be used for verification. The "Miscellaneous Records" says: "Boxwood is firm and grows slowly, growing one inch per year, and reversing one inch in the leap year." It also says: "The Chinese parasol tree can know the correct positions of the sun and moon, growing twelve leaves. One side has six leaves, counted from the bottom. One leaf represents one month, and if there is a leap month, it will grow thirteen leaves. By looking at the smallest leaf, one can know which month is the leap month." It also says: "Lotus roots grow according to the months, with one node growing per month. In the leap month, one more node is added." Furthermore, the Yunnan Zhi says: "The He Mountain flower is similar to cassia, with twelve petals per flower, corresponding to the twelve months. When there is a leap month, it has one more petal." It also says: "The udumbara flower is shaped like a lotus, with twelve petals. When there is a leap month, it has one more petal. This flower is white and fragrant, and comes from the Western Regions (probably referring to Buddhist India). It is also a type of sal flower." These are all evidences.</p>
<p>I have also heard that the tail feathers of the rainbow phoenix are also related to the calendar. The Yu Mao Kao Yi says: "The phoenix has twelve tail feathers, and when there is a leap month, it grows thirteen tail feathers." Below it also discusses music, saying: "The coda of today's small tunes in the Music Bureau has twelve beats, symbolizing the phoenix's tail, so it is called the coda. Or four words are added, also adding one beat, symbolizing the leap month." Writing this, I recall that there were many ancient musical systems that symbolized time, not just this, such as the zither. The Wen Xian Tong Kao says: "The zither has five strings, corresponding to the five tones; twelve strings, corresponding to the twelve musical laws; and a thirteen-stringed one, of which one string symbolizes the leap month."</p>
<p>Our country's agricultural affairs often follow the calendar, and in leap years, the timing must be late. The Qi Min Yao Shu says: "In general, fields should be mixed with early and late planting. In a leap year, the solar terms are later, so it is appropriate to plant late fields." This is why Dai Shulun's poem has the line "In the leap year, the crops are late." If we follow the Western system, we will lose our basis. Therefore, although the government has abolished the ancient calendar, it still shows people the new moons, full moons, and solar terms in order to benefit agriculture.</p>
<p>Other things that can be discussed are: the meaning of the character "潤" (run, leap), which is a unique structure. According to the Three Dynasties: "The Son of Heaven lived in the main hall of the Zongzhang, with his own room each month, but in the leap month, he ordered the king to live at the door, so the character "潤" (run) is composed of "王" (wang, king) and "門" (men, door)." The commentary on the Zhou Li explains it this way.</p>
<h3>The Servant of a Broad and Generous Heart</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Kiln Workers</h3>
<p>— Danxia</p>
<p>Kilns are distinguished as porcelain kilns, lime kilns, brick and tile kilns, etc. What is described below is limited to brick and tile kilns.</p>
<p>Where there are kilns, there is often a saying: "Big saws in the city, big buns (i.e., big steamed buns) in the countryside." They liken the city walls to saws and the kiln mounds to buns, which is quite accurate. Therefore, the most difficult part of building a kiln mound is the top surface that forms a dome. This is definitely not something ordinary plasterers can do; one must hire the so-called "kiln building supervisor." There are usually about four people, and their wages are particularly generous, and they are also treated to a full-course meal, which ordinary kiln workers envy.</p>
<p>In peacetime, there are tasks such as "loading the kiln," "firing the kiln," "fetching water," and "unloading the goods." Among them, the "kiln loading supervisor" has a relatively important responsibility. It is their job to economically arrange the clay blanks into the kiln. This also requires skilled operations, of course; and if the loading is uneconomical or the distribution is inappropriate, the fired bricks and tiles will be fewer in number and of much lower quality. This is very different from the interests of the kiln owners.</p>
<p>In addition, there are general female workers who are hired temporarily. -- Although they are said to be hired temporarily, they actually have a very strict organization, and others are not easily allowed to join the work. -- They are only used for "carrying blanks" and "unloading goods." They are collectively called "blank-carrying goddesses." The wages are only about 200 wen each time, and they are mostly young women. When a boatload of blanks arrives at the kiln yard, as soon as someone shouts loudly, they gather from all directions. They shuttle back and forth on the kiln yard like shuttles, their voices are clear and lively. When it comes to "unloading the goods," they put on their old work clothes, which are patched up with thousands of stitches, in advance, preparing to wrestle with the black kiln ash. When the work is over, they are all black all over, and they can't find any clean skin on their faces, leaving only a pair of dark, shining eyes and half-points of blood-red lips. Fortunately, people are used to it, and even if they walk among people, they are not surprised at all. This is also a type of occupation for ordinary women.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Lured by Profit, the Base Man Breaks Love; With High Aspirations and Healthy Feet, the Strong Man Flees to the Wilderness</p>
<p>Old Man Zhang laughed and said: Teacher Cheng, why would a smart person like you ask us such a question? May I ask, if they aren't officials, who can live in Little Western Paradise? We built the houses in Little Western Paradise with our own hands. After the houses were built, we people in tattered clothes were not allowed to enter. Isn't it right that people should be officials? Zhiqian looked at him and nodded twice, saying: You are right. If this Mr. Wang becomes an official, he will definitely repay you for helping him. What do you hope he will repay you with? Old Man Zhang raised his hand, scratched his scalp, and shook his head with a smile, saying: What should I have him repay me with? I'm so old, what comfort do I want to seek? I think, if Mr. Wang becomes an official in the future, he can set a regulation for our mud and wood workers, giving an extra one or two mao of wages to people over fifty years old. That would be a great merit. Teacher Cheng, you don't know, the effort of an old man is different from that of a young man. When they are working, they are already gritting their teeth. After the work is done, when they return home, they really don't want to say a word. Lying on the kang at night, they have a big illness, constantly shivering. Zhiqian nodded, saying: You are a benevolent person. People in this world always help each other. As long as you handle Mr. Wang's affairs well, I don't think Mr. Wang will let you down. Even if I act as a go-between, seeing your strength, I can't help but thank you. Old man, just go and do what you have prepared. Saying that, he walked closer to him, lightly patting Old Man Zhang's shoulder with his hand, expressing that close and classless meaning between the two of them. This time, it directly encouraged Old Man Zhang to become exuberant, and he puffed out his chest and said: Teacher Cheng, don't look at me being so old, I have a cavity full of hot blood, as long as I sell it to someone who knows the goods. Saying that, he stretched out his palm and clapped his chest several times in a row. Cheng Zhiqian said: Your sense of righteousness has raised my spirits quite a bit. Old Man Zhang said: Teacher Cheng, just tell me, what else do you want me to do? If I am even a little ambiguous, you Teacher Cheng can consider that you have wrongly recognized me. Zhiqian looked at his face, smiled, and then nodded, saying: I don't have anything else, it's still for other people. Didn't you hear that Sister-in-Law Hu is still there whimpering, wanting to sell someone else's flesh and blood? This can only be said with justice by a local old man like you, to suppress him.

<h3>Military Training of Japanese Students</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>In Japan, from middle school to vocational school, there is a subject called physical education, which is military training, about two hours a week. In addition to military training, middle schools also have gymnastics. However, schools above vocational schools only have military training and no gymnastics. The student army in our country's universities is famously composed of young masters. Taking off their smart suits and having to wear cloth military uniforms makes many people unhappy. What's more, having to practice with iron guns is even more exhausting. On weekdays, they shout loudly to save the country, but as soon as they have an iron gun in their hands, they feel the hardship, and it is definitely not as easy as saving the country with empty words.</p>
<p>Japanese students sometimes get lazy and absent from academic subjects. However, attendance at military training is compulsory. If there are too many absences, the score will fail, and there is even a risk of repeating the grade. In other subjects, they can whisper to each other in the classroom, or be more casual. However, as soon as the instructor arrives, everyone's face becomes serious, and their bodies straighten up. They have to endure for an hour without freedom. The instructors are all from the military, mostly school officers, and many have participated in wars. They are so familiar with the Chinese map drawn on the blackboard that even our country's geography teachers would be ashamed of themselves. They are even more familiar with the geography of the three northeastern provinces. They know what fortresses are there, what rivers there are, and roughly how many miles there are. They know how the Russo-Japanese War was fought. They know where the Manchurian Incident killed how many people. They know every winding village like the back of their hands. When they are in the lecture hall, in addition to teaching the infantry manual, they mostly lecture on the actual situation of previous wars.</p>
<p>The uniform for Japanese military training is different from the student uniform. It is made of yellowish-green cloth, and each set costs only a little more than three yuan. When practicing, they also have to add bayonets, ammunition boxes, and leggings. Except for rainy days when teaching in the lecture hall, there has been no interruption regardless of the cold or warmth. Recently, Japan has been unusually cold, with mornings as cold as six degrees below zero, but military training is still held. The instructors wear wool military uniforms, long military boots, and white gloves. The students' uniforms are thin, so they can't wear gloves. Standing in the wind, both legs are shivering.</p>
<p>There is at least one field exercise every year, usually in the suburbs of Tokyo. It lasts about three or four days, and each person has to pay a fee of four or five yuan. They often see students carrying guns on the road, which means that they are going to the gathering place. Last year, the Tokyo official middle school practiced with tanks, field guns, airplanes, etc., which is obviously much more advanced than our country. They have a conscription system, and everyone has an obligation to serve in the army, so military training for students is even more common. Several students were suddenly notified to join the army while they were studying, so they had to stop studying at any time and go to the army. The tuition fees for those few months can be waived.</p>
<p>The military training instructor also serves as a student supervisor, which is of course stricter than our country's dean of students. He manages all the students' actions and handles absences and requests for leave. Japanese students are respectful to him, and stricter instructors even force students to shave their heads like monks. The preparatory students of Keio University once caused a disturbance because of this. The reason why Japanese students all have shaved heads is because of military training. Our country's students only shave their heads for a few months during joint training, and they are already very lucky.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Words</p>
<h3>Idle Chat on Storytelling with Drums</h3>
<p>— Huang Baihong</p>
<p>Storytelling with drums was originally called "drum lyrics," referring to the general term for singing stories accompanied by a flat drum. The flat drum isn't very large, hence the reason for calling it "big drum" stems from the fact that drum lyrics used to specialize in performing lengthy stories, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin. Nowadays, the performances have all become shorter segments, no longer using large sets, and should be properly called "drum storytelling."</p>
<p>Drum storytelling is a product of the Yellow River basin, having been introduced by farmers and spreading from villages and towns into cities. In the past, during times of peace and prosperity, people would gather in open spaces to listen to storytelling during their leisure time after farming. The drum (therefore the drum was short-legged) even used discarded farm tool iron pieces as accompanying instruments. To this day, the "plow blade pieces" mentioned in Shandong, Henan, and other places still have traces that can be found. However, once it entered the cities, it had to follow the refined taste. Thus, "plow blade pieces," due to similar pronunciation, became "pear blossom drums." Nevertheless, the flat drum was still short-legged, only the iron pieces were changed to copper pieces; the original appearance can only be imagined. Therefore, many people believe that drum storytelling originated in Shandong, and the current so-called pear blossom drum is the ancestor of drum storytelling.</p>
<p>The old capital, Beijing, used to be the model area of the country. Once drum storytelling entered the capital, the short-legged drum transformed into a high-stand drum, and the copper pieces became small sandalwood clappers; and the tone also changed from crude to refined. Therefore, a separate school was formed, which is the "even tone big drum."</p>
<p>Currently, the types of drum storytelling, in terms of region, can be divided into even tone (also written as even rhyme tune) big drum, Shandong big drum, and Fengtian big drum. Generally speaking, there are only two categories: even tone big drum and pear blossom drum. (Note that Shandong, Fengtian, etc., all belong to the pear blossom drum.) In terms of tone and lyrics, the even tone big drum has reached perfection, clear and pleasing to the ear; the pear blossom iron pieces inevitably have too much rustic air, so the orthodox of drum storytelling is now considered to be the even tone big drum.</p>
<p>Performers of the pear blossom drum variety are mostly female, while the even tone big drum has both male and female performers, but most of the masters are male. This is probably because drum storytelling requires physical performance, and women's spirit is ultimately not as strong as men's. As for the tone of pear blossom drum, it is fundamentally upright, and when sung by women, it can be neutralized, but when performed by men, it is rather rough.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the octagonal drum, which is said to have been the exclusive entertainment of the Eight Banner people, originating from the victory songs of the banner soldiers. Strictly speaking, it should not belong to the category of big drum. The plum blossom tune (now commonly known as plum blossom big drum) is said to belong to the octagonal drum category, but all the instruments used are the same as the big drum, and there is usually a single-stringed instrument in the middle. The Taiping ballad is sung a cappella without stringed instruments. (Note that the above mostly belong to Beijing tones.)</p>
<p>Speaking of the material of drum storytelling, much of it is taken from opera: such as Nanyang Pass, Changban Slope, Huarong Road, Farewell Mother with a Barrage of Arrows, etc. In modern times, Peking opera became popular, so some drum lyrics inserted Peking opera tunes: Ma'anshan, Ziqi Listening to the Qin, adding Erhuang; Empty City Stratagem, Nanyang Pass, adding Xipi, etc. (Thus, there is even a clever establishment of names, called Peking Opera Drum.) Even the physical performances during singing are inseparable from the flavor of opera. Furthermore, in general lyrics, some words and tunes can be found at any time. Therefore, some people believe that some of the lyrics in drum storytelling are very similar to Yuan Dynasty songs. It is likely that some of the drum lyrics were written by scholars, but most of the authors did not reveal their names, so few people know about it. Among them, only Han Xiaochuang and Jia Weishan are relatively famous. Jia was from Jining, Shandong, and his drum lyrics were compiled and printed into a book called "Wooden Skin Lyrics."</p>
<p>I am completely ignorant of lyrics and music and dare not act as an interpreter. However, I certainly love to listen to drum storytelling. I think drum lyrics have literary characteristics: first, the interest is moderate; second, the style is strict; third, it is close to spoken language. Therefore, I believe that drum storytelling has a great future. I hope that seniors with literary cultivation and those who are good at lyrics and music will participate in researching and improving it.</p>

<h3>Don't Hope in Others</h3>
<p>— Tan</p>
<p>After the major explosion in Japan, their outcome is still difficult to predict at this point. However, the occurrence of an incident is bound to be due to a dispute between two factions, resulting in the defeat of the moderate faction and the victory of the radical faction, the defeat of the literary faction and the victory of the military faction. This statement can be said to be the rule for any incident.</p>
<p>The average newspaper reader and those who care about national affairs are frightened upon hearing of the Japanese incident, as if a major disaster is about to arrive. Hearing that Hirota received the imperial order to form a cabinet, they are delighted, thinking that they can rest easy from now on, because Hirota is a key figure who advocates a policy of peace and does not advocate a scorched-earth policy. Their delight is understandable. However, Hirota's cabinet formation was met with disapproval from the military, causing setbacks. Thus, a newspaper stated, "Since the occurrence of the incident, the political situation surrounded by an atmosphere of unease was about to release a glimmer of dawn, but unexpectedly, the evil currents rising from the military suddenly expanded, and the smooth and easy birth of the new cabinet is about to sail onto a reef." People cannot help but feel fear again.</p>
<p>Naturally, the origin of this sudden change in Japan, triggered by the suggestion of what kind of people, is undoubtedly clear. Now that Hirota has formed a cabinet, Hayashi Senjuro, Shinzaki, Abe, and Araki have been ordered to resign. Even if this situation temporarily appeases the situation, there may still be unfortunate consequences in the future. Therefore, a newspaper stated that Hirota's resignation from the imperial order to form a cabinet is only a matter of time (reported on the 6th). According to a report from the 7th Allied Press, Hirota's meeting with Terauchi resulted in the new cabinet being formed today. All in all, even if Hirota's cabinet formation succeeds, it will definitely not be Hirota's cabinet.</p>
<p>Therefore, I dare to conclude that the radical faction will not fail and the moderate faction will not prevail in this Japanese incident. Furthermore, I will say that no matter which faction fails and which faction prevails, it will absolutely not benefit our country. In short, this internal dispute of opinions in Japan has nothing to do with our country. The difference between so-called moderation and radicalism is only the difference in methods and means, while their fundamental propositions are consistent.</p>
<p>The same criminal, the scorched-earth policy uses the method of shooting or beheading to resolve the matter, while the peace policy uses the method of slow slicing or standing cage. The means of execution may vary in urgency, but the declaration of the death penalty for the criminal is the same. Therefore, we should stand firm, make up our minds, and set our steps. Whether they use a scorched-earth policy or a peace policy, we should deal with the scorched-earth policy with scorched-earth means, and deal with the peace policy with peaceful means. Otherwise, the scorched-earth policy is frightening, but isn't the peace policy also frightening? The scorched-earth policy is dangerous, but isn't the peace policy also dangerous? Therefore, I fundamentally do not hope in others.</p>
<h3>Field Frog</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>——One of the Spring Delicacies of the Hometown——</p>
<p>It is not easy to eat field frogs in Shanghai. They are rarely seen in fresh food stalls and are only available in Guangdong seafood stores around North Sichuan Road and Wuchang Road. People in Shanghai do not like the field frog dishes sold in restaurants because the meat does not taste good. People with delicate stomachs may not even be able to swallow it. We, who have tasted the delicious flavor of field frogs in our hometown, can easily tell the difference between good and bad and cannot be fooled.</p>
<p>Field frogs in our hometown are one of the precious foods, selling for a high price. One yuan can only buy four or five fat ones. There are many ways to cook them. Stir-frying, braising, stewing, boiling, and red-braising all have their own unique flavors. The skin and meat are tender and fresh, and the bones are crispy, with no unpleasant tastes such as being old, astringent, or difficult to suck. Fresh food stores sell them all year round; however, ordinary small restaurants still do not have such dishes. People in the countryside find it difficult to afford them, as a small bowl of field frog food costs at least six or seven jiao. Sometimes, my parents would occasionally catch a small field frog in the rice field and stew a bowl of rice porridge for us children, which was truly a happy occasion.</p>
<p>Those who catch field frogs are professionals, mainly using the methods of fishing and digging burrows. Fishing is mostly done in the summer, but the results are limited, so few people do it. In the autumn and winter seasons, field frogs all hide in their burrows, making it a good time to search and catch them. A person skilled in catching can often catch dozens of them a day when they are lucky. However, these people are all old opium smokers who live from day to day, with no definite plans. There is a folk saying in my hometown: "Catch shrimp to buy opium, water comes and fire goes," which describes the lifestyle of these people.</p>
<p>To catch field frogs, you also need to know the secrets. First, you need to be able to tell what kind of mud burrow is a field frog burrow and what kind is a snake burrow. You cannot be mistaken. Then, you need to determine whether the field frog has left or is still hiding there before you start searching and catching. It is said that these methods can only be learned through apprenticeship. Field frog catchers also have knowledge that others do not have, which is that they can tell whether it will rain or be sunny based on the depth and complexity of the footprints of the field frog on the mud burrow entrance, and it always comes true. Therefore, they often become volunteer advisors to the old ladies in the countryside.</p>
<p>After spring comes, after the Awakening of Insects, the field frogs that have been hibernating in their burrows all leap into the rice fields. The field frog catchers then change their methods, carrying torches at night to the rice fields and seedling beds, squatting in a corner, extinguishing the torch, and slowly making a "ge ge ge" sound to lure the field frogs from afar. When you hear the sound of splashing water constantly coming from all around, quickly light the torch, and you can catch the field frogs one by one into the bamboo basket. After Grain Rain, it is said that the field frogs become very docile and will crouch on the ground and let people catch them when the torch shines on them. If it has rained during the day and the weather is erratic, the ground temperature suddenly rises, then it is very common to catch hundreds or thousands of them in a few minutes on a calm night.</p>
<p>There is also a very strange folk saying about the field frogs after Grain Rain. It is said that at this time, the field frogs often gather in ancient ponds or mountain streams, forming a tower of thousands of them, and at the bottom of the last field frog, there is always a very poisonous softshell turtle guarding there, so you cannot catch them all. However, there is no further information on whether anyone has encountered this.</p>
<p>The spring season is the peak period for the field frog market throughout the year. Because they have hibernated for a winter, their skin and meat are particularly tender, fresh, and fat, making them even more delicious. However, as far as I know, the production of field frogs near my hometown has long been very small. The local production is certainly not enough to supply the market, and the field frogs sold on the market now are all wholesale from the mountain counties around Shangyu, disguised as local field frogs for sale, and the meat tastes much inferior. However, they are still ten times better than those in Guangdong restaurants in Shanghai. I heard some time ago that someone planned to establish a farm specializing in raising field frogs. If it can be realized, it would be a very new and fresh business.</p>
<h3>Family Letter</h3>
<p>— Wei Yun</p>
<p>My father sent three letters from the countryside in a row, the last one being an express letter. My hometown, Zhijiao Town, is a small town in the countryside of Wanxian County. To get there, you have to go to Wanxian and then take a boat for a night; and the boat runs every three days. There is no post office in the town, and the delivery of letters is handled by a grocery store called Wanli, which brings them to Wanxian by boat every three days and mails them. Incoming letters are also handled in this way. However, they do not carry express letters or registered letters because they do not want to be responsible for things that require stamps. Therefore, to send an express letter from the town, you have to go to Wanxian in person to mail it, and if the boat schedule is not convenient, you have to stay overnight in Wanxian. That is the most troublesome thing. When I received the last pair of express letters, I thought something bad had happened at home, which is why they went to the trouble of sending express letters. However, the words in the letter were the same as in the previous two letters, except that the words "come back" were circled closely. The words in the letter were: My second brother is getting married, and my third brother is also getting married. You have been wandering outside for many years, and your father is very uneasy. It's not like we don't have food to eat at home, so come back. Next month is the third anniversary of your mother's death, and you should go to the grave to kowtow. Mentioning my deceased mother deeply moved me. Three months after my mother's death, my father married a young woman. In less than a year, my fourth younger brother was born, creating a deep divide between the family—especially between the brothers and our stepmother. I, as if I were an older sister to my stepmother, acted as the executioner of the family in front of my father, and ran away with the excuse of wanting to start a business. It has been two years since I left. After I left, my father seemed very regretful. He often asked my second and third brothers to write letters asking me to come back, but my second and third brothers clearly wrote that it was my father's intention. It's not that they didn't want me to come home, they told me that this family was even worse than before I left. My second sister-in-law could not bear the young mother's indirect scolding and had tried to commit suicide twice. My father had nothing to say about that matter, as if he had not heard or seen it. He forgot my mother's last words, which were to take good care of us three brothers. He was immersed in the arms of his young wife, and he forgot his responsibility as a father. In the express letter, he suddenly mentioned my mother's third anniversary, perhaps the old man was missing the virtuousness of his former wife in his heart. I cheered myself up and went home.</p>
<p>It was a rainy day. My father brought my second and third brothers to the boat pier to pick me up. We didn't speak on the way home. My father was just secretly looking at me, but he seemed very excited and was walking very fast as usual. Reaching Wanli Grocery Store, he said to my third brother, "I'll buy two catties of wine. You guys go home first." The wedding of my third brother was only three days away. There were many guests at home, all on my stepmother's side. I didn't greet them and went to my father's study to rest. Before it was time to light the lamp, my father called me from the living room and immediately came to the study. He happily patted me on the shoulder, casually flipped through my luggage, and ordered the servant to serve dinner in the study. The four of us, father and sons, silently drank wine under the light of a kerosene lamp. My second and third brothers deliberately asked about my situation outside, but my father never interrupted. He stopped his wine glass several times and quickly drank it dry again, seeming to have a very good alcohol tolerance.</p>
<p>That night I stayed in the study. My second and third brothers secretly came in a few times, but they didn't say much and left again.</p>
<p>The next morning, my second brother told me that my stepmother and father had argued for half the night last night. My father didn't seem to have slept, and he went out early in the morning with red eyes, saying that he was going to invite some relatives. I felt like I was dreaming and asked myself what I had come back for. My father is old. Can he withstand such stimulation? And I can't do what he imagined as a son.</p>
<p>Before noon, a woman's voice was scolding the servants in the corridor. The corridor was behind the study. My second brother stuck out his tongue at me and pointed at me with his little finger. But the scolding outside was very intense:</p>
<p>"Want to be a guest? Sleeping until the sun is shining on the roof ridge, what does that look like..."</p>
<p>A second, old voice answered, it was my father. He said, "The servant is lazy, what's the fuss about?" As he spoke, he stepped into the study with a bottle of wine in his hand, but he stopped at the door of the study for a long time without saying a word.</p>
<p>My second brother took the wine bottle from his hand, and the scolding outside was booming like thunder again.</p>
<h3>Nonsense</h3>
<p>— (Blow)</p>
<p>Japan's Hirota Koki formed a cabinet, and Britain expressed satisfaction. Old Man Tan said that Hirota advocates a policy of peace and does not advocate a scorched-earth policy, which seems better, but a scorched-earth policy is like cholera, and a peace policy is like tuberculosis. It seems better to outsiders, but the authorities are uncomfortable. Moreover, Hirota is under environmental pressure. How can we know that tuberculosis will not turn into cholera?</p>
<p>The US Navy discovered an international espionage case and found that valuable naval secret documents were stolen and sold to a certain foreign country. Old Man Tan said that the punks in our country, throwing coins, picking pockets, and stealing fountain pens, are their best tricks, but international thieves, stealing naval secret documents, the difference between big punks and small punks is really worlds apart. It is appropriate that those who steal hooks are condemned, while those who steal countries become princes.</p>
<p>Novel</p>
<h3>Early Winter in Qingyang Port (13)</h3>
<p>— Qiu Yuan</p>
<p>In the guest room, a gramophone and some records were found on the chairs. One by one, the records were played.——This one is very good, listen.——This one is even better! Look.——This "Diaen" is very nice to listen to.——The one before was masculine, but it's somewhat feminine, look, the name is so good, and the tone is so plaintive, DiaenMyDiaen.</p>
<p>Qiu Hua walked over, took her hand and embraced Zhuo Min's face, very forcefully, and gave Zhuo Min a very short kiss; Zhuo Min leaned back on the rattan chair, listening to the plaintive music. He also felt serene, and also felt the meaning and value of being a human. Days are always like this, so what else can he envy? However, what Zhuo Min felt was not only the taste of this short kiss, but rather the emotions beyond the kiss. Any woman would kiss him, but the reason why the taste of the same kiss is different is not only the kiss itself, such as the environment of the kiss, the time of the kiss, and the person of the kiss, but rather the emotions beyond the kiss. In others, besides the sensual feeling, what else is there? The same kiss, some is the enjoyment of the senses, and some is beyond the senses. What else is there besides the senses. If it is said that it is just a kiss, then it can be said that it is not worth half a penny. So when Qiu Zhou Hua kissed him, the serenity that Zhuo Min felt was not only sensual satisfaction, but rather like grasping a belief, a kind of spiritual detachment, and obtaining something greater and more sublime. These, only in Qiu Hua, can make him hunger for these emotions.</p>

<p>Traitor</p>
<p>Traitor is a realistic drama depicting social ugliness and cruelty; in Traitor there is a woman—Zhu Wenying—who struggles out of a feudal family and becomes a traitor.</p>
<p>In Traitor there is an officer—Ruibo—who becomes a traitor to feudal forces the first time, and a traitor to God the second time.</p>
<p>In Traitor there is a nurse—Ms. Shen—who specializes in flattering wealthy and powerful upper-class young mistresses, and who changes her attitude when they lose their money.</p>
<p>In Traitor there is a doctor—Dr. Zhang—who looks lustfully at young women and pretends to be attentive.</p>
<p>In Traitor there is an old pastor who wears a mask of benevolence and love for humanity, but is actually more ruthless than a wolf—Old Pastor.</p>
<p>In Traitor there is a nurse who colludes with evil—Ms. Wang.</p>
<p>Zhu Wenying and Zheng Ruibo reach the peak of love, and live together without getting married, thus becoming traitors to feudal forces.</p>
<p>In the necessary process of living together, Wenying is pregnant with a child. At this time, Ruibo is also a company commander in the army.</p>
<p>Wenying moves into the hospital because she is about to give birth. She lives in a second-class room, so the doctors and nurses in the hospital are very friendly to her. Nurse Ms. Shen becomes sisters with her, and Dr. Zhang considers her as his sister. She also recognizes an old pastor who is recuperating in the hospital as her father. In this way, she has a sister, a brother, and a father, so she is not lonely at all and lives a very happy life!</p>
<p>However, before the child in her womb is fully developed and able to come down, she begins to have bouts of intense stomach pain.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her husband Ruibo sneaks out to visit her when his army unit passes by here before heading to the front lines. Wenying is of course very happy, but later, because Ruibo only brought twenty yuan and could not pay the room fee and medical expenses, she is looked down upon by Ms. Shen. Dr. Zhang also feels embarrassed to lust after her because her man is here, so he takes a look at the thermometer and runs out! Wenying also confesses her and Ruibo's past to the old pastor, hoping that the old pastor will sympathize with them, but after hearing this, the old pastor puts on a stern face and does not even recognize her as his daughter! At this time, Wenying and Ruibo break the new idea of "there are still good people in the world" and more firmly confirm the old idea of "there are no good people in the world".</p>
<p>At this time, the army's bugle sounds! Because Ruibo sneaked out, he will be punished by military law if he does not go now, but he cannot bear to leave his wife who is rolling around in pain on the bed, and hesitates. The second bugle sounds again, but Wenying is in even more pain. Of course, he cannot leave so heartlessly, but in fact he has to leave!</p>
<p>Finally, Ruibo shoots the fetus in Wenying's womb, solving the problem and becoming a traitor to God.</p>
<p>At this time, Wenying will no longer have stomach pain! Ruibo does not have to leave his wife!</p>
<p>The old pastor sees this situation and takes out a police whistle, preparing to blow it. Ruibo snatches it away and puts it in Wenying's mouth, asking her to blow out her last breath from this silver whistle. Yes, Wenying's last breath is blown out from this silver whistle with a smile! The old pastor shouts out "These two traitors to God"!</p>
<p>At this time, the marching music of the army rushing to the front lines can be heard in the distance. The sound gradually decreases from loud to low, until it is faint and cannot be heard.</p>

<p>Opening: "Spring Sorrow Song"</p>
<p>The slanting bridge leads to the courtyard, a piercing cold arises. Empty and silent, the embroidered chamber is warm with mandarin ducks. Reluctant to part, thoughts of spring reflect like a mirror. Dreamy shadows encroach, enough to dissolve the soul. Languidly, ill, she rises, too lazy to dress. Intoxicated, supporting her head, she cannot help but grow thin. Thinking of it, the lamp flower last night reported joy. But, the auspicious day is shallow and unclear. Pleasantly, the parrot is sincere, reciting poems haltingly. But, the swallow is foolishly persistent, complaining of hatred frequently. It is already, the twenty-four seasonal floral omens. Only the floating silk and chaotic catkins fill the gauze window. Once, I remember wandering the garden, treading every path. A kind of pity, engraved deep in the bones. Once, I remember, carefree, the library by the curtained hook was quiet. From the deep hall, the sound of playing chess was sent over. Once, I remember, the thirteen bejeweled columns of the zither were delicately plucked. Jade-like and round, truly the sound of white clouds. Once, I remember, the Pekingese puppy at the bottom of the screen spied with drunken eyes. A fairy awakening from the Yao Terrace, hairpin askew. That day, hurriedly covering my sleeves, the Yangguan Road. The horse slipped, the frost was thick, walking under the moon. Now, I wish to send the green, green riverside grass. To bring sorrow straight to the short and long pavilion. Only getting by, the sewing bees and butterflies are bored and helpless. Secretly buying rouge, embracing fallen petals. Therefore, my gaze cuts off the green mist and water by the bridge. North of the Magnolia Hall, I tread on the remaining spring. Blaming Eastern Emperor for being too troublesome.</p>

<h3>Star's New Film Casts</h3>
<p>In "Lovers in Exile" and "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery," Hong Shen expressed his sorrow for the rise and fall of his homeland. Now, his new work "Lovers in Exile" has been completely written. Undoubtedly, this is another profoundly meaningful social drama. It has been decided that Zhang Shichuan will direct it, and the start of filming will not be far off.</p>
<p>"New and Old Shanghai" Cheng Bugao is continuing with "Brothers' Line" and preparing to film the new work, also written by Hong Shen, "New and Old Shanghai." This is a satirical and humorous comedy. The light and dark sides of the metropolis are clearly reflected on the screen. The explanation of the plot has already begun the day before yesterday. The actors include Wang Xianqi, Shu Xiuwen, Xie Yunqing, and others.</p>
<p>"King Kong Mine" and "Jade Horse" are where Xu Xinfu opened up a new path in the domestic film industry, giving the audience a new taste. In this regard, we are hoping for more of his efforts. Now, his new work "King Kong Mine" is about to be prepared for filming. This is a work standing on the same road as "Jade Horse." For eager audiences, this should be news worth introducing to you.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian also has two or three new scripts completed, and Mr. Liu Na'ou has also completed one. In the near future, they can all be filmed separately.</p>
<h3>Dance Market Published Today</h3>

<h3>Silver Scribbles</h3>
<p>— Zhizhi</p>
<p>"It is said that 'Philosopher' is not a pseudonym for Xu Suling. This is indeed very interesting. 'Certain people often use pseudonyms to praise themselves and deceive the masses,'" that is a common trick, which need not be said again; however, those who are "actively working" and have produced "a little" achievement are not Zhiyu, so what is Zhiyu "praising himself" for? What is "praised" is only the likes of Mr. Philosopher.</p>
<p>I remember we said before that Shu Xiuwen and Pan Zinong were separated, but soon after, another "hero" jumped out and said that this was a rumor with provocative intentions. The reason was that he was very familiar with "my husband" (forgive me for quoting the "old-fashioned" term again), and according to him, "husband and wife" were very harmonious.</p>
<p>Now, the fact that Shu and Pan are separated has gradually been confirmed. Where has that "hero" gone? I do not know. Probably he has transformed into another face, right?</p>
<p>What has been done cannot be hidden. "Heroes!"</p>
<p>Mr. Philosopher has probably become "indulgent" because of "humility." To see the "original form" of the "heroes," "indulgence" is better than "humility," because when demons transform into beautiful women, they have to be a little "humble," but when they can't help but become "indulgent," that is already the revealing of their original form. Although the original form appears hideous and terrifying, it makes the audience shrink back at first sight, preventing them from being deceived again. That point is, in any case, beneficial to the audience.</p>
