<p>— 都</p>
<p>成都事件交涉尙未開始。而北海日僑中村順三又以被害聞。在中日關係好轉聲中。而一再生意外之波折。豈特地方常局引為遺憾。卽在吾人以企求和平之心理。亦無不扼腕而太息。誠以兩國邦交。雖有待於調整。而雙方國民相與之際。原無甚深之裂痕。何至以睚眦之仇念。演暴戾之事實。今衅端旣已釀成。懟恚亦屬徒然。惟盼兩國當事者。以合理之手腕。謀妥速之解决。勿令交涉頓廻遷延。轉令事態愈陷於糾紛。</p>
<p>中野被害之眞相。連日電訊所傳。雖猶語焉不詳。惟聞其人僑居北海。已有廿餘年之歷史。平日與地方人士。必能溝通聲氣。卽其濡染所及。亦已無殊土著。自非倉卒蒞臨惹人注目者可此。且其肇禍之由。傳與顧客舌爭。因動武而受傷。因傷重而斃命。就直覺而論。實一尋常鬭毆之命案。寗有何種意義之可尋。唯此事件之發生。適當成都慘案之後。而北海又為曾經抗日之十九路軍所駐防。緣是召致嚴重之影響。要非常人始料所能及。今日艦已奉命馳往。意在舉行調查。而當地駐軍之能吾不生誤會。固猶深滋疑慮。肇端本出無心。演變何所底止。刁作謙氏極意勸阻日艦之開往。卽為出於此項之顧慮。日方果無擴大事態之意。當能著眼於事實困難之所在。而採取非常審愼之步驟也。</p>
<p>自蓉案發生以來。日方悄緒高漲。表示過度憤慨。當時吾人卽以平心靜氣從事考量為言。而在東京之穩健報紙。亦深感逾分刺激之非計。蓋當中日國交逐步調整之今日。卽有偶發之不幸事件。極應以互諒之精神。求消弭於無形。詎能激永過　。自貽伊戚。而雙方輿論界。尤應運用冷靜之頭腦。力持平允之論調。使情感有所調節。交涉自易就緒。斯為吾人最低限度之認識。茶顧日方之賢明同業。對茲亦能有深切之反省。</p>
<p>抑吾人又有言者。每遇中日間發生一事件。日方輒認為排日運動之再燃。其實吾國民愛好和平之情意。久已與世人以共見。國府有敦睦邦交之明令。人民無激越言詞之表現。自有經濟提携之呼聲。彼此益謀實際之接近。卽有一部分不愉快情緒之保持。亦不難於好意周旋之下。使就消除。唯已往經見之砲艦政策。最足為雙方親善之梗碍。今當兩案交涉之始。日方誠能覷破此點。把握機會。一以溫和之手腕。為結好之嘗試。其於中日間之陰霾空氣。必能有顯著之轉換。繫鈴解鈴。是在於日方之善自為謀矣。</p>

<p>申報儿童專刊秋季開學了小朋友快努力求學！  秋郎　　諸位小朋友：光陰如流水般的過去，現在暑假已滿了，秋季又開學了，你們不是都要拿了書包，進學校去了嗎？我想：你們久違了的和藹的師長，和闊別了的親愛的同學，現在又得共聚一堂，互相談話，該是多麽的快樂，平添了不少興趣！　　但是在這長時間的暑假期中，我想你們也許會被炎暑的威逼，或者娛樂的引誘，已將上學期師長所教導的各項功課，逐漸的遺忘了，（雖然也有肯用功的小朋友，仍在家庭溫習，但恐總在少數）現在應該趕快去謀補救方法！便是將幾種書本上遺忘的地方，迅速地檢出來，去請敎師長詳細指導，一方面用心記着！聰着！否則上學期所得的智識學問。還未瞭解明白，本學期又去聽講新的功課，得新忘舊，試問有什麽用呢？　　而且處此非常時期，工商衰落，農村崩潰，小朋友都是未來的主人翁，便也負有一份復興民族，挽救危亡的重大使命！那末在這求學時期，對於－切的學問，極應當格外的努力、以冀高深的造就，長大以後，自然能夠為社會効勞，為羣衆謀幸福，為國家增光榮啊！昆蟲  眞　　在夏末秋初是昆蟲活動得最厲害的時候，因此敏兒在這當兒捕捉昆蟲的工作是很忽忙了。每天躲在花園裏去探尋它們的蹤跡，在晚上手裏拿了蒲扇到小河邊去拍螢火蟲，在日中，時常在牆角瓦礫之中，去捉蟋蟀，而他是很懂得，絕對不去傷害一隻蜻蜓，因為它是有益於人們的。他在日中手裏拿了一隻香烟罐，更拿了一隻捕捉蟋蟀的網，不久，便能滿載而歸。他捕捉蟋蟀是很擅長的，因為他有尖銳的眼光，敏捷的動作。有一天，他捉了一隻蟋蟀，便細細的去看，這是他第一次的觀察，因為他捉了它，從來沒有看個淸楚，所以這次觀察之後，就發生了妤多的疑問：　　『哥哥，你看這隻知了是不是昆蟲？怎麽能判別出來？』　　「知了是昆虫，你要判別出來！這倒很容易：（一）昆虫的全體是分做頭·胸·腹三部，並且這三部都是由許多環節合成的。（二）頭部有觸角一對，和複眼兩隻，單眠幾個。什麽呌做複眼？你瞧！知了的頭部，不是有兩隻很大的眼睛，而你再細細的看，在這大眼睛裏有許多的小點，這小點就是小的眼睛。總之，由許多小眼而構成大的眼晴，這大眼就呌做複眼。於是你要知道這動物是不是昆虫，只要看它有沒有複眼，那是很容易的了。（三）胸部是由三個環節所成，每節生脚一對，有三節便有六隻脚。在胸部的上方有翅勝二對。（四）昆虫是沒有骨骼的，而它身體外面便生着一種角質皮，這便呌它外骨骼。（五）昆虫都他卵生的。但是這五點昆虫一般的特性。因為昆虫的種類是很多，不免也有例外的吧。』　　『那麽昆虫有多少種類呢』？　　『昆虫的種類是很多，約佔全動物界十分之七，而現在已經有名字的竟有六十多種，這個數目驚人不驚人？昆虫又因它的口器，翅膀和發生變態的不同，普通分做八種：（一）直翅類：它是生着兩對翅膀，三對脚，第三脚很長，於是能够跳躍，幼虫的時候和成虫的形狀很像，像蝗虫等。（二）鱗翅類：它全身生着很多鱗片，兩對翅膀很大也有三對脚嘴，像一根細管，平時卷在頭部的下面，用時伸長吸取花蜜。幼虫時像靑虫一般像蝴蝶等。（三）膜翅類：它也有兩對翅膀，不過翅膀很透明，脚也有三對。嘴能咬緊硬的東西，幼虫時有時像蛆有的像靑虫。像蜜蜂等。（四）鞘翅類：它也有翅膀兩對，第一對翅膀極硬，而第二對翅膀柔薄。幼虫時像蠶，像天牛等。（五）雙翅類：它只有一對翅膀，三對脚。嘴有時像舌，有時像針幼虫沒有脚，像蛆的形狀，像蒼蠅和蚊子等。（六）有吻類：它有兩對翅膀六隻脚，而嘴像吻狀，便於吸收植物的汁液，像蟬等。（七）脈翅類：它的身子很細長，生兩對透明如紗的翅膀。三對脚生在胸部的下面。嘴能咀嚼東西，鬚很短，像蜻蜓等。（八）彈尾類：它是昆虫中最低等的動物，頭部有腮兩對。頭旁只有單眼而沒有複眼。身體很小，且大都扁平，沒有翅膀。尾端有鞭狀或劍狀的附屬物，便於跳耀，所以呌它為彈尾類，衣魚是屬於這一類，在舊書籍裏，我們時常可以發見它的。』世界各强國的飛機製造量  齋夫　　老鷹一多，鳥便不安於林；鯨鯢愈繁，魚便不安於水；鐵鳥飛舞，人類也就不安於地面了。人類愈是不安，愈要想法如何保護自國的安全。要保障自國的安全，愈要增强對外抗敵禦侮的力量。如今世界各國，那一個不是競擴空軍。便捷交通，要賴航空事業的發展；較量國力，要看飛機的多少。　　目下各國製造飛機的數量如何，是値得吾們注意的。　　英國：有三十五個飛機製造廠。其中十四個廠是專門製造軍用飛機的。　　法國：有三十二個飛機廠。都是受政府津貼的。　　德國：有飛機廠十七個。其中最大的一個雇用着一萬五千個工人。　　蘇聯：有飛機廠十一所。每年製造飛機二千架。　　意大利：每個月製造一百架戰鬥機。　　日本：有七個軍用飛機製造廠。　　美國：在去年（一九三五）一年中製造軍用飛機四百五十九架。　　我國近年在航空救國聲中。由家只　製造機　　　：　　　　　　外國買來的，所以　下的急務，除了　　航空人才與購買飛機之外，應該想法自己製造，方能大量產生。這是國家百年久遠之計啊。科學問題騎脚踏車怎麽比走路省力？  子系　　大家知道汽車比走路省力，是因為汽油馬達在替人走了路。可是騎脚踏車完全是用人力，走路也是用人力，為什麽同樣用人力，騎脚踏車便會省力呢？我們知道爬山要比走平地費力得多，這是因為地心吸力將人向地心的方向吸，而人却硬要背着這個力量向山上爬，自然很費力。走平路固然沒有向地心走，但也沒有背了它的方向爬，所以走路比爬山省力。至於騎脚踏車的時候，自然身體只穗穩不動，一來未背着地心吸力走，一來人在走路的時候，總要一顚一顚的前進着，這向上一顚，便等於爬山一樣，是背着地心吸力的。騎脚踏車的人，就沒有這樣一顚一顚，自然較為省力了。不過現在的脚踏車，騎的人仍不免要用些力，因為車軸與輪盤的摩擦，少不了還要用人的力量，希望小朋友們大家用一點心思，衣這裏研究研究，怎樣把這摩擦的阻力减少而至全無，那人騎在脚踏車上簡直可不費吹灰之力，很自由的駕駛着了。海洋中的植物  董遜　　海洋也和陸地一樣地有許多許多的植物和動物生存在裏面。牠們也一樣底需要食品，需要養分；牠們也樣有「優勝劣敗」的競爭，不過所需的方式跟陸上的生物不相同罷了！　　海產動物中單就魚類一項講，已有二萬多種了，其餘各稱之量數就可想而知。海產植物的種類也很多，但是其中體形較大而為世人所注目的只有：綠藻類，紅藻類，褐藻類，顯花植物和分生藻類等數種其餘的種類，若是我們要看到牠們，那非要靠顯微鏡的力量不可了。　　這兒八種的海產植物，都是藻類，是我們能看到的。　　（一）大昆布　昆布俗稱「海帶菜」，全世界約有廿九族（一百數十種），大昆布為毘布屬中最廣大的植物，它的葉于中央部最闊最厚，上下兩端較為狹，薄，而華却很短，全長普通在十尺內外，最長大約有二十四，五尺。昆布可供我們食用，味道很好，此外史可製　及海藻酸。　　（二）龍鬚菜　龍鬚菜或名髮菜，其體為細長圓柱形，常從一根細根簇生許多細枝，各株隨處發生側校及小校，而且各個部份形狀相同，大小一樣，龍鬚菜上部長有許多半球形的囊果，假使生有多量的囊果，則很像一串不整齊的念珠。龍鬚菜雖供食用，但其質剛靱，非為佳品；其生存常互相交錯而集成團，所以我們吃到的大都好像亂頭髮的一般。　　（三）鷓鴣菜　鷓鴣菜可供藥用，能治小兒腹中虫病；其質根堅靱；新鮮時其體帶黑紫色，乾燥後變為暗褐色，在日光中暴曬之就成為黃褐色了，全體之長達七，八寸。　　（四）回萱藻苔　其體呈細綫狀，表面有細毛，所以在水中時看起來好像　白色的，植物體長成後有一尺半左右，中空如管，每隔一二寸有緊縊蓋，惟此部份不與他部俱長大。此種植物之幼株，暴曬乾燥後亦可供食。　　（五）扁平水松　植物體帶深綠色，呈扁平長披針形，體多單一，間或有多岐者，長約二，三尺。亦供食用　　（六）海索麵　海索麵之體為圓柱狀，長五，六寸，或為單條，或分又簇生數條，質很柔軟，其味甚美，供食用，其表面粘而滑，帶暗紫色，頂端微　綠色，至　成時則其上部由黃褐色而變為乳白色。　　（七）石花菜　石花菜繁生於淸澄之海中，普通為紅色，亦有紅紫色者。體形大槪為扁平綫狀，根為絲狀，分歧着生於岩石上，其植物質之組織，有廣大之細胞，間隙充滿瓊脂樣物質，為製洋藝之最好原料，洋菜除作食品之外，尚可用之於印刷，造紙，造布，醫藥等業之上。　　（八）石薄　有　的根很細小，而從根直接生扁平的葉，沒有莖的。顏色鮮綠，很美麗，近根之一部稍深，葉之上端有乳自色之緣邊。此物亦可作食用。　　以上八種，（一），（四）屬褐藻類，（一），（三）（六），（七）屬紅藻類，（五）（八）屬綠藻類。　　小朋友！你可知道日本海藻輸入我國每年有幾多？我告訴你：每年有四十萬担，值五百萬元！　　我們中國並不是沒有領海，沒有水產生物的，小朋友！快快努力！快快努力！牠們在等待你們去開發！閉了眼睛到為何似乎見紅色  白沙　　我們都有一種經騐；在白天，我們向着光綫閉了眼睛，就會看見紅色；在黑暗中我們雖然閉了眼晴，如果有人點了燈，總可覺着已經有了亮光，并且是紅色的；這是什麽道理？確是一個奇妙的，趣味的問題。　　其實說來也狠簡單，我們閉了眼睛就會看見紅色，和鳥閉了眼睛也會被光所驚醮，是一個道理；因為眼臉是有一些透明的，所以不能阻止一切光不穿進眼睛裏來，并且眼臉裏是有紅血的，因此能够經過眼及臉的光，就經過常在臉裏的紅血，這紅血就把光綫裏的其他光綫留住，單讓紅色光穿進來；所以我們在光綫裏閉起眼睛，就會看見紅色。秋海棠  自强　　秋海棠，秋海棠，　　你的葉兒多麽美麗！　　你的花兒多麽芬芳！　　我們中華民國的版圖，　　好像你的葉兒榜樣；　　我們的人民愛好和平，　　好像你的花兒淸香；　　但是那可惡底小毛蟲，　　願掉了你葉兒的邊旁，　　食你長著玫瑰花的刺，　　給他一個創傷！　　使那跳梁的小醜，　　不致旦夕騷擾在你的邊旁。　　那時你葉兒的完整，　　定博得世界萬國的贊揚。小黑炭，釣魚  　　　作　　（一）小黑炭在釣魚。　　（二）釣起一條大魚來。　　（三）小朋友去捉了一隻　貓。　　（四）把他桶裏的魚偷去了。關於蛟蟲的故事  楊志剛　　當從前開鑿巴拿馬運河——就是在美洲中部，聯絡太平洋同大西洋間的一條運河——的時候，起初本是法國人來開的，但是不知怎樣，一般開鑿的工人，常常發生瘧疾，並且是很容易傳染，每年害死的工人總有好幾萬，於是工作就覺得十二分的困難，實在是很難繼續下去了！於是就只好讓給美國人來繼續，美國人研究出了瘧疾的流行，完全是因為一種「瘧蚊」傳染的緣放，於是就努力撲滅蚊蟲，講究衛生，使工人得安全地完成這巨大的工程，這也要算這撲滅蚊蟲的功為最大了！　　我國古時候有一個文人，他終天是很用功讀書，但是在晚上的時候，許多蚊蟲都一齊向他亂咬，全身幾乎都被牠們咬遍了！他實在是恨極了！於是就想出了一個方法，搬了二隻瓦　，放出桌子下面，把二隻脚塞到裏，於走蚊蟲就比較安靜多了！呀！小朋友！你有沒有看到過王先生的滑稽影片，恰同他差不多。國王與牧童（八）  新　　小王華樂嚷着道：『重重的嗎，我瞧你旣能拿得起這重重的東西，那我也不算一回事。你把這杖伸進來，我要拿一下子。』　　『如此，你把那王冠也遞給我，我們來交換一下。』　　小王華樂很高興的說道：『很好，我就去拿，』說着，躡足走上樓梯去。他偷愉地跨過那睡着的衛士，而那猛狗嗅到了它主人的氣味，也就－聲兒不響。小王華樂取了他的玉冠，疾忙回到那滿照着月光的窗子前去。　　『王冠來了，』他說時，就把那王冠從窗格中遞了出去，又道：『你且試戴一下，快把你的杖交給我。』　　他們兩個同聲喊道：『這東西一些兒也不重！我拿在手上不覺得什麽！』　　他們倆談了幾分鐘，彼此比較着所過的日子；那小王華樂千元自抱怨目己禁閉得不能自申，常被許多人包圍着，而那牧童華樂却又抱怨自己總是過着戶外的生活，並且一個人冷　淸地，太寂寞了。　　小王華樂說道：「我的母親說，我是許多老百姓們的公僕，呀！我的主子，實在太多了！我願意像你一樣，還是做那羣羊的主子倒好。」　　牧童華樂答道︰「我並不是那些羊的主子，其實是它們的奴隸，我的父親曾經對我道　說。况且它們實在是屬於你的。因為它們的背上都印着一個小小的王冠。」　　小王忙道：「是這樣的嗎？這眞好玩了。最有趣的是我那王笏的模樣兒却又好像一根牧人的杖。」　　他們這樣的談講着。牧童華樂漸漸地覺得那王冠正在嵌進他的頭額，他並且覺得這東西越戴越重，額上已在作痛，而頭也低垂下來了。同時，小王華樂握着那牧童的杖，本來是覺得很輕的，此刻也漸漸地重起來了。他想這東西一定是用鉛來製成的。當下他吐了一口氣，換在左手裏執着。這當兒那牧童華樂忽地呻吟一聲，把那王冠從頭上摘下來了。　　他接着說道：「咦！這東面重得很！你怎麽會一天到晚戴着的啊？」說時，忙把這王冠塞進窗格裏去。　　小王華樂也把那牧人的杖從窗格裏戳了出來，一面說道：「咦！這東西重得很，我不知道你怎麽一天到晚拿在手裏的。」　　「這眞好玩啊！」他們倆同聲說着，又很響朗的同聲笑了起來。那小王覺得很矣傲，想他的頭上能够戴得起這樣的重量，而那牧童也很覺得驕傲，想他的右臂為了帶着那杖，一天一天的强勁起來了。　　他隨卽開口說道：「天色已在發亮了。我須得回去看守我的羊。」　　小王嚷着道：「你下次再來，再來和我談談」　　從此那牧童華樂每年總有一次要到王宮的牆外來，隔着窗格和小王華樂根懇切的長談一一番。小王常和牧童說在宮中是怎樣的納悶。牧童也往往對小王說外面是怎樣的寒冷。因此以後小王每逢不滿意的時候，總得記起那牧童哭泣着要進宮來，而那牧童在自怨命苦的時候，他也總得起那小王哭泣着要到外面來。　　這兩個孩子都長大了。他們倆也像普通的人一樣，各自懷着憂慮；然而也各自得到好多的快樂，因為一個是良好的國王，而一個是良好的牧人。他們倆一樣的名播遠近，那黃頭髮的華樂被稱為「他的百姓們的牧人」，而那黑頭髮的華樂已做了王家的牧羊人，因此被稱為「牧人中的王」。（完）</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　業餘周刊哲學講座從「齊田氏大會賓客」說到目的論和機械論  吉華　　從前有過這樣的一個故事，說：『齊田氏大會賓客於庭，有一個人送來了魚和鴈。田氏說：「上天對於人們眞是厚道呀！產五穀，生魚烏，給人食用」。當時衆客都紛紛響應。獨有鮑氏之子不贊成，他說：「萬物同我們幷生，沒有那個貴，那個賤，誰為誰而生，誰該食用誰，這都是一種弱肉强食，並不是甚麼上天給我們定製的規律。要不然，那蚊蟲吸人的血，虎豹吃人的肉，又作何解釋呢？難道上天也為蚊蟲和虎豹而生人嗎？』這樣的一個故事，看來似乎是很陳腐的，　通常的，在現在好像沒有研究的價値；而齊田氏的言論之謬誤和鮑氏子議論之正確也似乎不成問題。但是誰又知道這一點點小問題在目前以及數千年的哲學史上還是爭論不休，而且到現在還有人在典雅的深奧的哲學面貌和哲學術語的隱慝之下常常犯着齊田氏所犯的謬誤呢？　　到現在，硬還有人主張鼠是貓要吃牠才生的，勞動者硬是為了給資本家僱傭才生的。比如哲學上的目的論者，其主張的終極便可達到這樣的結論。他們認為宇宙的運動和進行都是按照着一定的目的。甚麽事情都是有計劃的，有理想的，有目的的。而目的論之中又分做兩派：一派認為宇宙一切事物以及整個宇宙的本身，都自已依着自有的目的計劃進行，不假諸外力的參加。這就呌做內在的目的論。還有，認為在宇宙和宇宙間一切事物之外，還有一個主宰宇宙的造物主，來指揮，規定宇宙之進行，幷照着這造物主的意旨，向着一定的鵠的進行，這就呌做外在的目的論。例如蘇格拉底，亞里士多德，柏拉圖都是目的論者，而柏拉圖則為外在的目的論者，亞里士多德則為內在的目的論者。　　在哲學上間時又另有一派，其主張却完全與上述的目的論相反。他們認為宇宙之發展變化都是有其必然法則的，宇宙好像是一架機器，共運動亦如機械的運動，一點也沒有偶然和自由之存在。决無所謂目的，更無所謂造物主。只有因果，而無計劃，理想。如古代的泰利士，德謨克利特，伊壁鳩魯，近代的斯賓諾莎都是屬於這一派。現在的許多科學家，哲學家也有很多屬於這一派，如倍根，雲布士，費爾巴哈等。這一派總名為機械論者。　　那末，他們究竟誰對誰不對呢？　　如只從事實的現象上去考察，也可說都對都不對。如我們要簡單地否認目的論者的主張，說世界一切都沒有目的性存在，那麽將有許多我們不能說明的事例。比如我們要造一座房子，我們要是沒有打樣，設計等等計劃，我們能够建造成功嗎？如果我們沒有改造社會的理想，我們怎樣的達到將來完滿的社會呢？顯然地，人類的行為都是有目的意識的，决不是完全盲目地進行的，不管目的是否能够達到。所以對於目的論者，如只簡單地否認也未見得正確。至於機械論呢？是的，宇宙一切都有其因果法則，决沒有神為之主宰。但是人類也是完全循着這機械的法則行動而一點也沒有自由嗎？在人類的行為中一點也不容許或不曾有一點目的性嗎？所以絕對地贊成機械論，也要陷於不能解釋客觀事實的手病。　　再進一步說，如果我們否認客觀世界之必然法則，單只照着自已心目中所想的計劃目的進行，那仍然是要陷於有動狀態的。因為不去理解客觀情勢，而只注意主觀，那不管你擬了怎樣多怎樣完善的計劃，結果却都是「閉戶造車，出門不合」，這是內在目的論者會達到的害處。如事事都認為有一現世界以外的主宰者右那冥其之中指使，策動，那我們本身的努力便沒有用處了，結果不亦同樣成了「聽命主義」，和絕對的機械論者所達到的「宿命論」，「定命論」嗎？反之，如完全贊同機械論者，那必定會成為等待主義」。反正客觀世界客觀事實自有其運動法則，不能阻止，也不能推進，卽是說，人類也完全受制於這必然的因果法則之網中，雖努力亦無絲毫效用和改變，那我們還是只聽其自然而不加人為的力量好了。照這樣那不也同樣把自然法則看做一個冥冥之中先天地規定好了的計劃嗎？試問同那外在的目的論又有多大區別呢？　　所以簡單地反對某者和絕對贊同某者，都是不對的。　　原來客觀世界是有其因　必然法則的，但是這也並不就說毫不容許有目的之存在。自然，要在自然界中去找尋目的性，比如說太陽在夏天為了人類要收穫稻穀而特別直射於北半球，寸蠖為了要避免烏雀之啄食而有意識地變成泥灰色，成為樹枝狀態，那必然是荒謬絕倫的。但物質世界進化的結果，由自然界產生出了人類社會，自然雖無目的意識之可尋，而人類社會則有目的性了。在自然界，卽使是動物，牠們的行動都是簡單的本能，在受着刺戟後發生反映，因之牠們只能適應環境而不能改造環境，只是被動地改變牠們自己的器官，來適合周圍的環境，以延續其生存，而不能主動地用自己的腦子想出計劃，方法，來改變客觀環境，以適於自己之生存。所以動物仍然是完全受制於自然界鐵一般的機械法則，而說不上具有目的性。如果說含羞章，捕蟲草，具有保護色的動物，虎的爪牙，善走的獸之長足等都是有目的性存在，那又何嘗不可以說宇宙之日月星辰，天氣之陰晴寒暖都有目的性存在呢？須知這些都是由於用人類的意識去比擬自然的結果。因為人類是有目的意識性的，凡作一事，凡發一言，如沿考其本，都不是無為而發，因之，便把自然界也人類化，而把目的性加諸於牠。這完全是觀念論者的見解。　　人類是無數萬年宇宙進化的產物，他具有高級組織的物質—腦髓，同時也具有這種物質的高級的屬性—意識，他不單是本能地受刺戟而發生反映，他同時更能由感覺而達到思維。這是人類與動物不同的地方。單是具有本能，感覺，那只能被動地吸受客觀世界的反映而不能組織這反映，但有了思維作用，則不僅被　地吸受反映，而且能將反映組織起來，從這此不斷地反映和不斷地與自然界鬥爭的實踐中，更深一層地漸决發掘客觀世界之發展規律，並根據這種規律來改變客觀世界。卽是說，人　已不是自然生長性的東西而是具有目的意識性的東西了。所以在自然界只有機械的必然法則支配着，而在人類社會則具有目的性之存在。　　但是，說人類有目的，並不就是說人類可以有自由的目的，而完全不受客觀的因果法則之支配。倒是相反，如果要目的之能成為現實，要目的之可能達到，那反而更要充分地深一層地認識客觀之因果法則。徹底說來，人類也是自然的產物，也是自然的一部分，要他自覺地了解自然的法則，他才能利用自然，征服自然，改造自然，卽是說要客觀的因果法則轉化到主觀上來，那主觀的目的意識對於客觀世界才能發生反作用。所以目的意識性並不是完全與客觀法則對立的。人類於多年的實踐中，漸决漸决一步一步去認識自然，自然界的法則一步一步地由「自在之物」變成人類的「自己之物」，而為人類所把握，同時人類的目的也一步一步地容易實現，其到達的可能性也一天一天地增大。這是一種矛盾的發展。若只是空想，那要自由便反而要弄得不自由了。　　至於人類之於社會，更是這樣。人類於社會生活的實踐過程中，為社會進化法則所支配，因之也不斷地把這客觀的社會法則反映在自己腦子裏面來，經過長久的期閒，積蓄到許多的經騐，就主觀地把掘着了人類社會的因果規</p>

<p>律，跟着這種規律又來推進社會之發展或改造牠。所以凡是歷來的社會改造者同時又都是偉大的理想者，其目的是比普通人要遠大些的。　　總之，着眼於現實，客觀世界，要從實實在在的事物之中去找因果法則，我到因果法則，再定我們行動的目的，不應盲目地行動，從主觀上去建立目的，也不應機械地服從客觀法則而自己毫不努力。這樣，我們才能從「必然的王國走到自由的王國」，由「解釋世界」而到「改變世界」。外埠郵政代辦所國選在鄕村  平　　江蘇某縣通訊　　某天晚上，我們正在晚餐，忽然門外走來一位不速客，手里執了一大把卡片，檢出一張卡片交給我的哥哥。我很奇怪，細細看卡片，原來是这次參與競選的〇〇〇，▲▲▲，×××，□□□，明午要下鄉假座某宅宴請本區的鄉鎭長。據那僕人說，當晚還要下　分送請貼帖呢！　　第二天，據說本區的鄉鎮長已為第二派人說妥了都不去參加他們的盛會，到了午刻，不幸他們事先預備的好幾桌酒席沒人來吞嚼，客人到的只一鎭長一鄉長兩人而已。他們乘興而來，敗興而回，但晚上全班人馬仍回到城里宴請城區各鄕鎭長，據說這處的成績甚好。　　八月十五日舉行全縣公務員宣誓，全縣鄕鎭長都進城。大的午刻時分，宣誓畢，大家出公共體育選人各派人鵠候招待宴會，最初用：「請，請，請到我們那邊！」不靈，則尾隨之，最後，舉起胳膊拉着走。有人笑着說：「這些鄉下老兒，何來這大吃福。」據說这次的宴席殊為華貴。　　從七月中起，據已知的（公開的）競選宴會總計如下（根據地方報紙）：七月二十五日×校長××（競選人）設宴滬上，招待本邑士紳。八月十二日□律師□□（競選人）假座本城棉業公會宴士紳。八月十三日□□□再設宴於吳家館。八月十四日，□□□一行至外岡，邀請鄉鎭長宴會。八月十五日，公務員宣誓，▲▲▲派與口口口派各派人有塲拉客赴宴。八月十六日×××在南翔南園宴請各鄕鎭長。八月十九日▲▲▲，×××等四人偕前省議員某某到婁唐，借印宅設席宴請五區鄉鎭長，到者兩人，是晚回城宴請一區鄉鎭長。八月二十日×××在黃渡宴請鄉鎭長。八月二十一日×××，▲▲▲等四人在某校宴請本地士紳，廚子特由上海雇來，菜肴精美，每桌三十元，共五桌。八月二十三日×××於南翔宴請各鄉鎭長，是晚特派專車送至上海，包大東旅館房間數十間，嗜京劇者觀京劇，喜電影者看電影，並有舞女招待。八月三十日×××再派專車敦請各鄉鎭長至滬赴宴，仍包大東房間，翌日專車送回。　　競選活動日漸白熱化，雙方的攻訐之聲也日囂張。〇〇〇對人說：「我的屬員□□□，他向我拿了二千元為我活動，那知他錢一拿去，竟為自己活動了。我與他勢不兩立！」後聽人說：〇〇〇與□□□本為表兄弟，到了競選熱烈的時侯，述表兄弟也不認得了！　　×××托某鄕紳　　致函於某區長，囑為×××帮忙。某區長接函後躊躇久之，繼乃直截作答書略謂：「舍姪孫□□□亦擬活動國選代表，勢不能兩全，甚歉！」寫這兩封信的人都是邑中宿儒，若能把這些信公諸同好，必不愧為國選花絮中的好史料也。　　有某鄕長，在本地某代用小學敎員，月薪僅九元，平時固無人提汲者，此决□□□允以事務所書記一職予某鄕長，某鄉長卽整理行裝首途赴滬。那知行至中途，行李與人一併被▲▲▲派人架去，亦另允以職位。有人說：破廟里的泥菩薩，平時雖無入來燒香，但一旦佛運高照，也會似紅佛一般的紅呢！　　公然賄賂，大家知道事情太危險，聰明的競選人致某區諸鄉長信中說：「所需車馬費若干，請儘開示可也。」這樣可謂無憑無據，巧妙無比了。又，某競選人允某鄉長女公子某女士免費入某競選人所辦的學校肄業，這也可稱再漂亮沒有了！　　在許多競選人中，，宴席之奢華，開支的闊綽，以×××為最，其他諸競選人，均望塵莫及。×××曾作豪語：「準備以五萬元作活動的費用！」據接近各競選人的說：▲▲▲亦巳化了一千餘元，但看看×××聲勢暄赫，方興未艾，錢長鳶遠，力難與之對拚，故近日懊惱殊甚云。　　局外人看了這連台好戲而後，覺得非常懷疑。國選代表旣無生財大道，寗非又將以魚肉鄕民或營私舞弊為取償之淵藪乎？若國選代表的選舉要以金錢為活動的唯一辦法，則沒有黃金作後盾的優秀分子及眞正具有政治認識者豈不是要聞而却步嗎？　　本來，競選的方式不一，但終應以政治主張為依歸。在歐美許多民主先進國，每逢競選季節，各政黨出發演說宣傳，熱閙一時，各作政治主張的坦白表示，令人敬佩無已，而手段之光明磊落尤使人不勝其敬仰！但何以我國的競選從不見有人出而作政治主張的發揮，徒有宴會等等的活動呢？這是我們所始終不解的。生活縣政府僱員  李任　　在某縣縣政府裏幹過三年了。雖然在官塲中混了這麽長的時間，我却沒有一點兒「官」氣。雖然我也有一個「官稱」，呌做「僱員」，然而却離「官」太遠。所謂僱員，顧名思義便知道是僱用的人員，譬如僱工，僱農之類，不過究竟比他們又要斯文一點。同時這位置雖然小得像一粒小米，究竟也要算得是政府機關的職員。每天出入縣政府的大門，有時還可以同縣長接近，却也引起許多人的羨慕。假如親友中有人在縣府打官司，那我就特別受尊敬，受重視，因為遞狀子，抄批示這類手續，要找我帮忙纔不致吃虧，纔比較順手。有時故意擺起　子，吹噓自己對於某件案子如何在縣長面前求情，如何在司法官名下說好，所以纔提前訊間，纔比較輕鬆。於是親友們不但對我表示十分羨慕，而且表示十分感激，如果黑心一點的話，我很可以在這時撈幾個子的禮物呢！其實大纔曉得，像我這麽一個小小的僱員，能够求個什麼情？說個什麽好呢？自然我也常常碰港縣長，碰着司法官，可是他們的眼睛不一定就注意到我，那有向他們說話的資格呢？　　要知我們僱員上面還有「辦事員」，「科員」，「科長」，「秘書」，「縣長」幾重梯級壓在頭上，慢道說活動，就是出氣也要細聲一點，走路也要小步一點。不然的話，別人就要說你虛搭架子，對於前途是有妨害的。自然也還有比我們更小的，那就是聽差和傳達了。　　說到僱員的工作，可稱為道地的「啃桌子」，因為整年整月整日整時都在桌子上寫字。大概縣政府的佈吿，各級各式的公文函牘都是我們的手筆，除此還有各種各樣的表册也全由我們僱員塡造。所以僱員的起碼條件便是要會寫字，而且最重要的是一手端正的小楷。不過公文函牘的格式也要弄得很熟悉，不然便會鬧出很大的笑話來。譬如起稿的人大都愛打簡省算盤，一件公文凡是關於摘錄原文的一部分，總是用着「云云」等字樣來代替。如果你不懂這些套頭。也在正式的上行公文上寫着：「案奉鈞府某字某某某號訓令內開「云云：」，那麽「云云」二字總會打破你的飯碗。因為上峯見着這不合格式或認為有意搗蛋的公文，必然要申斥你的上司，主官一被申斥，辦理文件的人便罪大惡極了！要知一件公文是由科員起草後送呈科長核閱，再送秘書審閱，最後纔送呈縣長書行簽字。如果沒有更改，起草的科員便分派給僱員謄寫。謄寫淸楚了後，不再呈上司核閱，祗交給管卷人登記，以後就交給收發處發放了。所以核閱後的錯誤是由謄寫的僱員負完全責任的。　　寫字這項工作，在從前讀書的時候，每天寫個一篇兩篇，倒不在乎，有時　仿某種碑帖很相像，還覺得異常的高興，可是現在拿寫字換生活，就感到十分的枯燥，十分的辛苦了。如果有「一字値千金」那樣大的代價，自然又會　得很快樂而且很興奮的。可是我們每天最少要寫五千字，每個字雖不如一般人所說的「一點如桃，一捺如刀。但却沒有一筆苟且，最少「工整」二字還說得上。拿價値來計算，一個字攤不上半文小錢，這樣賤價出賣貨色，那說得上樂意呢？　　現在各縣大都「裁局改科」，如像從前的敎育局建設局公安局，都一古腦兒歸併到縣政府，因此縣府的事務加多了，往來的公牘也繁雜了。可是在這節縮政費期間，職員却反比以前减少，以最少數的人來辦很多的事，當然要弄得手脚不停，整天都得不着休息的。自然所謂工作繁忙並忙不到科長，秘書，縣長他們名下因為他們的工作照例是　行，簽字，蓋章，最多也不過累他們多拿兩次筆，多撲幾决官章而已。醫如幾件公文要化費我們三四點鐘的謄寫，送呈他們那裏　行簽字，祗消三四分鐘便辦理完畢了。　　目下已實行聯席辦公，卽是說上至縣長，秘書，一二三科的科長，下至各科的科員，辦事員，僱員，都要在一個辦公室裏辦公。自然，科長以上的坐位原等於虛設，可是我們這批小職員就不敢離開坐位一步。所以我們每天八點鐘便上辦公室，除了吃午飯休息個把鐘頭外，直到午後五點鐘纔得拖着疲乏的身軀走出辦公室。在一般人所說的「上辦公室」，差不多都含有開玩笑的意味，因為他們到辦公窒並不是辦公」，而是劃到，吹牛，看小說，或是談論同事的長短。可是我們當僱員的就享受不到這些權利，一方面是時間不許可我們這樣幹，二乃是受了資格和職位的限制。要知辦公室裏的任何人都比我們的氣派來得大，他們自然不屑同我們閒談，而同時我們自己因感覺得地位渺小，也不敢和別人吹牛談天。　　我們一跨進辦公室，很規矩的走到秘書處劃了到，然後輕手輕脚的退回自己的坐位上，趕快整理筆墨，硯池，大的剛把墨水磨好，應該謄寫的公文便分派來了。於是放正身體，聚精會神的把稿子上的東西，一字一行一點一劃很端正的寫在正式公文紙上。上行公文不能有一字的簡寫，不能有一字的錯落，刪改，否則便要重寫。有時全部都已寫好，祇在後面某處脫落個把字，也要重新寫過。這種錯落並非由於粗心忽略，而是因為過分疲乏，腦筋一時昏亂所致。這種工作在表面看來似乎很籣單，呆反，不過是一點技術工作，其實腦筋要同手指，眼睛一樣用力；如果不用腦筋思索，那錯誤便會更多呢！　　名義上我們每天祇做八九個鐘頭的工作，暗地裏我們却常常睡半夜，起五更。當這澄淸吏治，整頓政務的時候，一月之中上級機關至少要派四五個調查員前來考察民政，調查建設或敎育，有時還要調查特別案件。這些調查員大都要帶來許多表冊，預備將來回去作「調查報吿」。他們自己當然不願意塡寫，而且　無法塡寫。譬如他是調查戶口保甲的，他怎知這縣有幾多戶口？有幾多人數？有幾多壯丁？有幾保？有幾甲？他的名義和任務雖呌「調查」，其實他不過來同縣長玩兩天，或义幾　麻雀而已。因此，這些應該由他自己做的工作，便無理由的統統推到我們僱員頭上來了。於是我們除了加緊做完自己的工作，又要加緊的給調查員塡寫表册；為了遵守他的限定的時間，我們就不得不做夜工，開早車。我們無緣無故的額外支出自己的精力，心裏難免不時時通着怨恨，但上司衙門的人連縣長也不敢輕慢，何况我們這區區的僱員？從前所謂「制臺衙門的挑水夫要同典獄官比大小一的故事，我是牢牢記住的。　　我們一個月的「啃桌子」，一個月的辛苦，所得的報酬祇有二十元。然而在縮减政費期間，還是八成開支的呢！時事研究法波同盟的復活  禹　　波蘭是戰後出現的最大的一個新興國家，它介在蘇聯和法國中間，當波羅的海至黑海之衝。德國要向東發展，縱橫於波羅的海上，進攻蘇聯，並西抗法國，稱霸歐洲，便非抓住波蘭不可。反之，蘇聯要鞏固它的西部國防，法國要防止德國的向外發展，也必須拉攏波蘭。所以，戰後法國除使小恊約國護衛於其左右外，更於一九二一年與波蘭訂立軍事同盟，這樣地將德國包圍起來。但自希特勒登臺以後，德國在東進政策之下，與波蘭成立了十年互不侵犯條約；此後德波兩國當局更常常互相訪問，在許多國際會議中它們也居然站在同一戰綫上，關係表現得非常密切。這樣一來，一九二一年的法波同盟便失掉牠的作用了。　　不過，波蘭與德國間有兩個問題：卽但澤問　與波蘭走廊問題（科里多問題）不易得到和平解决。但澤是波蘭唯一的通達大海的出路，華沙當局當然不願把牠交還德國；但在大戰以前，但澤原是德國的一個名港，是它向東發展的必爭之地，戰後雖把這地方作為自由市，歸國聯管理，由波蘭掌握其一切實權，但德國却是沒有一天不想把牠收回的。至於科里多，則是東普魯士和德國本部間的一條長地，戰後這條長地移歸波蘭，使東普魯士與德國疆土不能連接，這當然也是德國所痛心的事；但在波蘭方面，它得到這塊地方後，不僅捷有了長的九十英哩的海岸，而且還可直接地自由地到達但澤，使但澤與華沙發生深切的關係。因此，但澤和科里多問題便成為了戰後德波間的無法解决的矛盾。德國要想東進，要想衝破法國的包圍，會忍痛地暫時將這兩大問題放在一邊，而與波蘭簽訂十年互不侵犯條約，這雖使德波的矛盾得以一時的緩和，但問題依然沒有辦法徹底解决。同時，戰後的德國是在日益窮困中，在金融力量上它實難以與擁有大量黃金的法國來爭奪波蘭。最近由於但澤問題的再行尖銳化，巴黎的外交家卽乘機活動，表示願在財政上帮助波蘭，結果便在波蘭陸軍敎育總監里資米格里將軍報聘法國時成立了法波財政軍事恊定，使已失掉作用的一九二一年成立的法波同盟再行復活起來。　　據報載，最近威立的法波協定的內容是：「（一）法波兩國默認一九二一年軍事同盟繼續有效；（二）法國允貸欵波蘭，用以建設鐵路，直通基尼亞港，使與但澤鐵路並行；（三）法蘭西銀行對於波蘭銀行規定長期貼現辦法；（四）波蘭訂購法國軍火。」至於貸欵數目，據各方所傳，則是二·二五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇法郞。同時，據說在談判中，法波兩國當局還在中歐問題的某些點上獲得了同一的意見，因之使波蘭與捷克斯拉夫之間的緊張局勢也緩和了下來。這樣的法波恊定的成立，是很顯然地表明了波蘭又回到法國方面來；而法國之所以能拉回波蘭的，除利用歐洲多變的政治　係外，主要地便是由於法國具有强大的金融力量。　　法國之以巨欵借與波蘭，使之擴張軍備，其用意不消說是在將波蘭武裝起來，以抵禦德國。如果波蘭完全不違背法國的志願，斷然離開柏林而再行回到巴黎來，那不　法國的外交力量要為之增强，而且會使以法蘇為主體的和平陣綫更為強大，因而使德國東進攻俄和西向抗法都會遇到很大的阻　。反之，假使波蘭一面恢復法波同盟，一面仍與柏林交好，採取所謂「超然外交政策」，那最近成立的法波恊定便只能使波蘭不積極助德抗法，此外似乎還談不到有重大的意義。就目前形勢看來，倘若希特勒不在但澤問題和科里多問題上採取斷然態度，逼迫波繭先全歸順於巴黎，那波蘭所行的「超然外交」還有繼續的可能。因此，法波協定的成立在德波關係尙無巨大變化以前，我們只能說這是法波同盟的復活；若因此就說波蘭已加入了法蘇集團，那便是過早的論斷。在華沙的外交家看來，恢復法波同盟是一回事，加入法蘇集團又是一回事；我們不能說法波協定成立便是波蘭加入法蘇集團以對抗德意的侵略力量。事實上，當里資米格里將軍尙留居法國時，波蘭半官報「波蘭日報」卽表明；「華沙之政治同情並未改變，只法國態度已轉趨向」；該報又謂「法國參謀總部現不主張法蘇軍事互助，反表示希望蘇俄在軍事上之援助楚一種幻想；在另一方面則深覺與莫斯科合作較密必引起歐洲危險空氣，法國現時已有若干方面欲找尋相當理由，取消與蘇聯締結之條約」。這也許可說是特別用來安慰希特勒的話，但波蘭之不忘情於德國，不願參加法蘇集團，於此也就可以概見了。　　至於德國，它對於法波同盟的復活當然非常注意。在里資米格里將軍報聘法國時，德　法大使威爾才克卽奉召返國，向希特勒報告一切，以便决定對　。到現在為止，雖然柏林方面對於新成立的法波恊定尙無具體表示，但當此希特勒正集中力量以圖東進的時候，德國或者還不會因此就與波蘭翻臉，使自身在外交上陷於孤立。目前希特勒的圖謀是在一面幻想法國態度轉變，一面又努力使羅馬尼亞等脫離法蘇集團，並鼓吹組織侵略十字軍，以維持國社主義的德國及資本主義世界的存在。然而，要法國態度轉變，便須使法國內政發生巨大變化；要矛盾百出的資本中義各國共組侵略十字軍，更必須使它們間的一切矛盾能在某一點上緩和甚至暫是消除：這都是很難實現的。星期文學會近代中國的幾個民族詩人  林義堯　　目前中國正處於生死存亡的非常時期。每一個中國人，只要他不是甘願當亡國奴者，這時都正燃燒着救亡圖存的熱情。這種熱情常常在一般言論和行動上鮮明地表現了出來，同時在文學上也有具體的反映。在這樣的情形之下，我們將過去的民　詩人喜行提出　評價一下，應該是有新的意義的吧。　　只要是知道一點近幾十年來的中國文學史的，一提到近代中國的民族詩人，當會首先想起黃公度。他又名遵憲，曾做過外交官，對於當時外人侵略中國的許多事件受到了很深的刺激。他的「降將軍歌」，　度遼將軍歌」，「悲平壤」，「哀旅順」，「哭威海」，「臺灣行」，都是以當時我國被侵略被掠奪的現實事件為題材，來喚醒中華民族的詩作。在「降將軍歌」中，詩人明白地貶斥了在甲午之役中的降將丁汝昌；在「度遼將軍歌」中，他又諷刺和嘲笑了　時的的逃　在「悲平壤」，「哀旅順」，「哭威海」，「臺灣行」中，他更哀傷了國土的喪失，以喚醒民族的振興。由於這些表現，我們可說他是中華民族的第一個歌手。　　不過，因為時代的關係，詩人黃遵憲在當時還未完全理解帝國主義的侵略行為，也未完全明瞭那時中國的社會情形和滿　的統治，所以，他在那些富有民族意識的詩作中，還是把甲午之戰當作過去一般國與國的戰爭來描寫，將戰敗的原因完全歸之於個人，因而對於全國人民的鼓動力也就較為薄弱。同時在詩的形式上也未脫離舊格式；梁任公曾謂黃公度是「能鎔鑄新理想以入舊風格」的「近世詩人」，這對他可說是很適當的批評。　　在甲午之役以後的民族詩人，除黃　憲之外，還可以舉出人所共知的戊戌政變的主要人物康（有為）梁（起超）來。康有為不僅是政治家，而且是詩人。他是代表當時新興市民的；在强隣脅迫，國土喪失的時候，他當然要將當時新興巿民的進步的民族意識在詩作中表現出來。如他的「愛國短歌行」及「愛國歌」，便是充滿了愛國熱　的。他讚揚中國地　物　，人　　多，要中國努力　　本主義的大道前進，以圖獲得「亞洲的主人位」。這樣的富國强兵的思想，在目前看來當然是離開實際的幻夢，但在甲午以後，在康梁維新的時代，却正是軍國主義的思潮在全世界橫流的時代，而那時中國的新興市民又正在向上發展，雄心很大，所以康有為在詩中所顯露出的那種思想，實是一種時代精神的表現。至於梁起超，他雖不善作詩，但他的文學主張，對於詩的見解，却是非常進步的；而且，他還作過一些詩詞，就中也有富於愛國思想，民族意識的，如「愛國朝四章」和「自題新中國未來記」，便是很好的例證。我們且看「愛國朝四章」的內容吧——「泱泱哉，我中華。最大洲中最大國，廿二行省為一家，物產腴沃甲大地，天府雄國言非誇。君不見，英日區區三島尙崛起，况乃堂矞吾中華？結我團體，振我精神，二十世紀新世界，雄飛宇內疇與倫。可愛哉，我國民！可愛哉，我國民！　　「……」　　這　的愛國精神，可說是當時一般國民思想的反映。　　當然，就在康梁的詩中，也還沒有描寫到帝國主義侵略中國的情形，更沒有表現出半殖民地的民族　　的正確思想，同時，他們的　作形式也是舊的；　是　　　　　的　　　　　，他們不　　　　　　現，也不能創造出新的詩歌形式；他們只能借用舊的形式來表現他們那種新的民族思想。　　緊跟着甲午之役而來的近代中國的偉大事變，是辛亥革命和「五四」運動。這兩個偉大的事變，都表現了中華民族的初期的覺醒和中國社會的前進；而同時，隨着中國社會之發展而發展的中國文學，由於這兩大事變的推動，當然也就飛躍地前進了。如語文的革命，如接受西歐文藝思潮，都可說是隨着這兩大歷史事變而來的中國文學的進步表現。但是，就在這時候，對於帝國主義侵略中國的本體，對於中國的半殖民地性，國人還沒有明確的認識，因而使中國從帝國主義下解放出來的思想也還不普遍，還未成為一種有力的社會思想，在文學上當然也還沒有鮮明的表現。及至新的社會集團在中國社會中形成並日益向前發展時，反帝意識，民族解放的思想，才成為中國社會思想中的一個重要內容，因之在文學上才反映出了反帝意識，爭取民族解放的熱情。這裏首先値得注意的，便是近代中國的第一個新詩人郭沫若。　　當然我們不能　單到這樣的程度：說郭沫着完全是民族主義的新詩人。　在談以詩作來表現半殖民地的中國進步的民族意識時，我們却是不應忘　這位少有的天才作家的。他著名的「女神」，誰也　要承認對於中國的解放有很大的積極作用；他的詩集「前茅」，更以不可抑制的熱情，表現了中國的進步人羣的意識，指出了爭取中華民族解放的正確道路。他警吿我們：如果不努力奮鬥，那「中華大陸的人們」便將「永遠沒有翻身的希望」了！　　其次，在詩中表現了進步的民族解放思想的，要算蔣光慈了。他的詩作和小說，雖然在技巧上還不能獲得很高的評價，同時，就是思想內容也還有應該批判的地方，但是，在他的有些詩作中，却是鮮明地表現了我們爭取民族解放的熱情的。　　此外，在「五卅」事件爆發後，還有一些詩人發表了許多反帝的詩作，惜乎不能在這篇短文內一一談論了。雜文重波  戎和　　「嗨嗨。」　　「先生，路遠，你老不在乎四個子兒……」　　在爭奪擾嚷中，一個白亮的帽沿在小三子眼前刺激的晃動，小三子正待舉步，那巡警的木棍已從白帽沿上劈向人叢中來了。於是，鐵　口演出了　條道路。那些戴禮帽的紳士和嬌小的身軀被裏在大衣裏的女人都跳上了車子，把鞋尖擱，到車夫背上，整整衣角，　人拉着去了　　以下接第五版</p>

"Your brother represents Chairman Song to see Mr. Wang and send his regards on his behalf. I also express my respect. Originally, Mr. Wang's motive for coming north was at the invitation of Song. Because Chairman Song only knows the public and does not know the private. He usually expresses admiration for Mr. Wang's political achievements. He heard that Mr. Wang was willing to come, and everyone was very welcome. After two months, he waited for Mr. Gan to come to Ping. When Mr. Wang met with Chairman Song in Ping, Chairman Song showed Mr. Wang very earnestly. His expectations can be seen from this. Later, because Mr. Wang had private matters to deal with, he still accompanied Chairman Song, who was very eager for Mr. Wang to come north as soon as possible to shoulder the burden entrusted by the country. At that time, Mr. Wang also took pleasure in agreeing to this decision to come north. Chairman Song's intention is still earnestly welcome." I once asked, "Mr. Wang has been running around in many ways recently and has exhausted his talents, but I don't know what Mr. Wang's intentions are recently. What Mr. Wang has talked about everywhere, I think, are personal opinions. I don't know if there are any concrete measures." Wang replied, "There are no concrete measures, and I personally express my wish to resign." (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Industrial and commercial circles in various places have sent several petitions to the Ministry of Finance requesting that it stop the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office. The Ministry is currently preparing a proper solution but has not yet responded separately. The saying that the Hebei-Chahar Inspection Office was established on the 8th is a mistake; it began registration on the 8th. It is still continuing to register now. As for the saying that the General Anti-Smuggling Office plans to set up branch offices in Peiping and Tianjin, nothing has been heard here. This is because the Tianjin Customs already has a very tight organization for anti-smuggling work in the Peiping-Tianjin area, and its strength is sufficient to cope. The Director and Deputy Director of the General Anti-Smuggling Office, An S'er and Li Tonghua, are both still in the capital. It is reported that Finance Minister Kong is carefully considering a solution to the problem and will be able to decide next week. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) Song Ziwen, Director of the Finance Department of Guangdong Province, told a visiting Reuters reporter that since the various plans for reorganizing Guangdong's taxes and currency system were implemented, the province's financial position has fundamentally stabilized. The Finance Department is currently implementing the announced plan to revive Guangdong's finances. Song is determined to solve the current difficulties with great tolerance and perseverance. Song's efforts are now yielding results. When the Reuters reporter visited Song, the work in the Finance Department was quite busy. Financial experts and consultants are working hard on a practical plan to bring Guangdong's currency into the national standard and determine which taxes should be included in the scope of "miscellaneous levies and exorbitant taxes" and abolished. Song gave concise and straightforward answers to the reporter's questions and solemnly stated that he himself is a practitioner who believes in doing more and saying less in all matters. Song himself is working very hard but is very quiet. When the reporter asked what progress has been made as a result of his efforts to improve Guangdong's financial position, Song smiled and said that although there has been some progress, the final goal is still far away. Since Song took office, many illegal taxes have been abolished, the most notable of which is the prohibition of gambling. Song is currently working on the issue of opium suppression. He believes that the government should implement opium suppression without causing a huge loss to Guangdong's revenue. Song declined to comment on the political situation, saying that what he wanted to say has already been seen in Chiang Kai-shek's recent declaration. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Translated by Mai Yi</p>
<p>The Sea of Okhotsk is often shrouded in dense fog and clouds, which can be said to be the most annoying part of our route. We knew this in advance and prepared to cross it at an altitude of 6,000 meters, but then we would have to use our own oxygen; therefore, we can only endure it for a while.</p>
<p>We are flying over the Yakutsk region at an altitude of about 4,700 meters. That is at the top of the mountain, endless, rocky peaks, illuminated by the sun. Soon, we flew over the northern part of the Sea of Okhotsk and passed there, heading for Petropavlovsk in Kamchatka.</p>
<p>The sea was covered by thick clouds. Only when we approached Kamchatka did a gap appear, allowing us to see four ships in the sea. We thought: If something happened, these ships would be our saviors.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Petropavlovsk, we dropped a flag with words written on it, but the city was completely covered by clouds. Only for a very short moment could we see the scene under the clouds, and we took a picture at an altitude of 4,000 meters. At that time, we were over Petropavlovsk and sent a telegram to Comrades Stalin, Molotov, Orjonikidze, Voroshilov, and Kaganovich, and then flew over Kamchatka and the Sea of Okhotsk to Nikolaevsk-on-Amur.</p>
<p>We were flying over the Sea of Okhotsk in an instant, and even for a moment, we never caught a glimpse of the sea surface. When approaching Chenyer Island, we had to lower the fuselage and fly arduously under cloud cover, fog, rain, and wind.</p>
<p>The weather when passing through the Tatar Strait was still just as bad. We flew as low as twenty meters, and raindrops obscured everything, making it impossible to see anything in front of the telescope.</p>
<p>I looked at my watch. We had been flying for fifty-six hours, and I was a little tired. At the same time, I felt that the oxygen was about to run out, which made me panic.</p>
<p>I opened the side window. The sides seemed a little clearer, but I still couldn't see anything in front of me. So, I said to Batukov, the pilot:</p>
<p>"We must rise again!" We rose to 2,500 meters, but here, the engine and fuselage were surrounded by heavy ice, forcing us to descend again, suddenly dropping from the clouds to fifteen meters above the sea. At this time, we were in the area of the Langer Islands.</p>
<p>The sky darkened, and it was difficult to distinguish objects on the ground. Due to such bad weather conditions and to comply with Comrade Orjonikidze's instructions, I decided to land. However, no place to stay could be found on the Langer Islands. Later, I saw a narrow strip of land extending nearby, which was Udd Island. It was dusk when I discovered this small island where the plane could stay.</p>
<p>Finally, a valley flooded with water appeared in front of me. I maneuvered the plane across the valley and finally landed on a sandy and gravelly shore. The aircraft was completely unharmed.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to say a few words about my friends. Batukov and Belyakov are both excellent and humble comrades. They performed very well and each had a calm mind and strong willpower. When I decided to hand over the driving task to Batukov, I was very at ease because I knew the plane was in reliable and skilled hands.</p>
<p>The entire flight was very difficult, but Batukov and Belyakov worked extremely hard without the slightest sign of fatigue. In addition to flying the plane, Batukov also helped Belyakov with important meteorological and azimuth work. Our busyness was inevitable because there were only three people in the plane.</p>
<p>We have been staying on Udd Island for a day and are planning to leave. The landing earlier was considered good, and the plane was not damaged much. However, taking off on this island is not easy. Finally, we found a place where we could take off, and we set off for Khabarovsk the next day, the 25th.</p>
<p>In addition, we want to think of Moscow, the capital of our motherland, and the great Stalin—we are willing to serve him.</p>
<p>Our flight shows that Soviet aviation has no limits, whether to the north or south; Soviet aircraft can fly anywhere at any time. This flight route was planned by Stalin, and now, the Stalin route has been successful.</p>
<p>Our flight is not a personal glory; Batukov, Belyakov, and I are all part of the 170 million people of the Soviet Union. We have fulfilled the wishes of the entire Soviet people—to open up the Northeast air route. We are very proud that we have finally lived up to the expectations of the motherland!" (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e35">US Cruiser Fire Case Apparently Sabotage The authorities are thoroughly investigating <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The Navy Department announced that someone attempted to sabotage the cruiser USS Indianapolis, which is currently being repaired at the Bloch Naval Shipyard. Afterwards, Captain Dunn immediately ordered strict surveillance of the ship and announced the details of the incident, saying that on August 25, someone inserted a nail into the electrical wire, causing a fire, but only the electrical wire was burned and the ship was not damaged. After inspection, two more nails were found inserted into the same electrical wire and penetrating the boiler room. The authorities have not yet obtained any clues as to who committed the sabotage, but naval workers are not suspected. The ship set sail this morning for a test run. If there are no problems, it is scheduled to sail to the West Coast on Tuesday. Navy Department officials also said that if strong evidence can be obtained, the similar incidents encountered by the cruisers USS Quincy and USS Vincennes will also be thoroughly investigated.

<p>(London) King Edward VIII recently toured Turkey, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Austria. The News Chronicle recently commented on the impact of this trip, saying that the King met with the authorities of each country during this trip. Most governments see this as the King launching something politically in his personal capacity. This impression is deeply rooted, and no amount of diplomatic explanation can dispel it. But we can say with certainty that the King's trip can restore the confidence of the countries that signed the Mediterranean Agreement in Britain. As far as Greece is concerned, the King's visit to Turkey and its countries should promote the evolution of Greece's policy towards Britain. In addition, Army Minister Duff Cooper and Navy Minister Sir Hall have recently visited various naval bases along the coast of Yugoslavia, which is also of great significance.

<p>The Nuremberg National Socialist Party Congress continued today. Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the party's youth corps, saying, "The German army must be ready so that it can deal with it easily when a decisive moment arises. If our enemies raise the Soviet banner against us one day, then we will rely on the banner of the National Socialist Party and win again." (12th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Nuremberg Führer Hitler gave a speech at the Zeppelinfeld last night, again fiercely attacking the Jewish nation and Bolshevism. He said, "If they try to attack us, the German flag will be hoisted high in the sky so that they can understand our capabilities. We do not believe that the Jewish nation and Bolshevism will have the opportunity to gain power in Germany again or to import communist toxins into Germany. The German people have been looking forward to peace for a long time. We will work and manage our lives according to our own wishes and will never be similar to the Jews of Bolshevism." People had been expecting Hitler to make an important statement on Germany's foreign policy, so a total of no less than 250,000 people rushed from all over Germany. Unexpectedly, Hitler replaced it with the above speech. After the speech, this moving ceremony ended. When Hitler was speaking, dozens of air force searchlights concentrated their light on one point in the sky, covering this mile-wide square with dozens of beams of light, which was a spectacular sight. Hitler also said in his speech, "We ask God for one thing, please do not let our descendants suffer the experience we have suffered today. No one will believe that our actions will have a day of annihilation. There will be young people who follow in our footsteps. We will just wait and see the future development. We must be cautious everywhere. I personally feel calm and confident and expect that today's Germany is only experiencing the early days of its youth and will gradually grow for hundreds of years to come. We only need to act according to the truth and fulfill our responsibilities. God will never abandon us." (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) German Führer Hitler has spared no effort in attacking the Soviet Union at the National Socialist Party Congress in Nuremberg recently. British diplomatic circles are already feeling uneasy, fearing that Hitler's actions, although said to be aimed at general issues, may turn to attack the countries participating in the Locarno Conference in the future, or even declare that all issues involving the Soviet Union will not be discussed. It is not yet certain that the British government notified Italy and Germany on the 10th of this month that the Locarno Conference would be held in London on October 19 to explore the true intentions of each country. As of now, Italy has not yet submitted a reply, and according to news from Berlin, Germany is at least hesitating. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Moscow) A military parade was held in Minsk today to end the Red Army exercise in the Belarusian Military District. In addition to those participating in this exercise, Chairman Gervikov of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union and Belarus, Chairman Koroday of the Belarusian People's Committee, Secretary Jicalo of the Belarusian Communist Party Central Committee, and Belarusian government officials all participated in the event. After speeches by the Belarusian Military District Commander, First-Class Red Army Commander, and General Commander of the Large-Scale Exercise Ubolevich, and the Director of the Military District Political Department, Second-Class Red Army Commander Blin, People's Defense Commissar and Soviet Marshal Voroshilov stood up and gave a speech, praising the actions of the various units and the organization of this extremely complex exercise, all of which were exceptionally good. Voroshilov also pointed out the love of the Minsk workers and the Belarusian collective farmers for the Red Army, as well as the great assistance given by the Belarusian party and government authorities and the leaders of the neighboring provinces of Western Siberia. Military delegations from Britain, France, and Czechoslovakia all participated in this military parade. (11th Tass Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On the 10th of this month, Koroday, Chairman of the Belarusian People's Committee, hosted a banquet to entertain foreign delegations visiting the Red Army exercise. Those present included People's Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov, Dukachevsky, Egorov, Budyonny, senior generals, and Belarusian government officials. During the banquet, Koroday and the leaders of various countries gave speeches. When Koroday spoke, in addition to welcoming the foreign military representatives, he pointed out that the main task of the Red Army is to protect the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union. "Under the leadership of its great leader and teacher Stalin, the Soviet people are constantly striving to cooperate peacefully with the people of other countries. The Soviet government, under Molotov, understands the will of its people and constantly defends peace and the collective security system, thereby proving its peaceful policy." Koroday expressed his satisfaction with the efforts of the Czech people, the Czech government, and President Benes to safeguard peace, and said that the British and French governments and the people are the same as the Czech Republic. Finally, Koroday raised a glass to Stalin, the organizer of socialist construction in the Soviet Union, Molotov, the leader of the Soviet government, Voroshilov, the People's Defense Commissar, and General Lucha, the leader of the Czech delegation from France, Czechoslovakia, and Britain, who gave a reply in Russian on behalf of all the delegations. "On behalf of all the delegations from various countries, I congratulate the government and people of the Belarusian Republic. We deeply thank Marshal Voroshilov for his invitation, which has given us the honor to visit your country. In these few days, we have been deeply convinced that your republic is constantly developing and moving forward. The evidence is in front of us, such as the countless amazing new buildings in your capital, the countless new factories, the improvement of the people's cultural life, the development of roads and railways as dense as spider webs, the well-cultivated collective farms, and the kind and hospitable working people of your country. Your people love their brave Red Army, which has made us recognize the excellence of its technical and moral training. This Red Army is the invincible defender of the Soviet people's peaceful labor and of general peace." General Sivesgate, the French chief representative, continued with a short speech, also expressing his gratitude and thanking the local government and Mr. Kor for their hospitality. At the same time, he pointed out the excellent impression given to him by this exercise, saying that the visiting representatives were all extremely interested. (12th Tass Telegram)</p>

<p>Nuremberg When the National Socialist Annual Congress continued this morning, Führer Hitler gave a speech to 20,000 female party members, saying, "The first woman, who can produce seven healthy and lively children, has made a greater contribution to our nation than the most famous female lawyer. Once the men in our country are all strong, we will not have to train women's grenade teams. Women are on their way up." (12th Havas)</p>
<p>Nuremberg Führer Hitler said to representatives of National Socialist women's groups today that we will never organize women's grenade teams or women's quick-gun teams. This statement was clearly directed at Soviet Russian female soldiers. Hitler also said that women who bear and raise children protect the survival of the country, which is more meritorious than any educated woman in the university. German women are not slaves. Other women regard it as shackles, but German women regard it as welfare. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) Regarding the Locarno Conference, responsible officials here told our reporter, "The Italian government is willing to send representatives to the conference, but does not believe it will be successful." In addition, Italian public opinion and newspaper editorials have expressed reservations and indifference about whether this conference can establish a new Locarno Pact. As for the invitation to Soviet Russia to participate, Italy has always opposed it. Although foreign newspapers have said that Italy has no objection to this, the Italian government has denied it twice. However, although Italy opposes Soviet Russia's participation in the Locarno Conference, it does not intend to demand the abolition of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Pact as an exchange. This is different from Germany's attitude. In addition, British King Edward VIII recently visited Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey, and the UK and Egypt have also concluded a treaty of friendship and alliance. The British island of Malta has also promulgated a new constitution (Note: Malta has been implementing a new constitution since the 2nd of this month, stipulating the organization of an advisory committee to provide consultation to the government on legislative and administrative matters). Britain has also sent a large number of troops to Palestine, so Italy's hope for the success of the Locarno Conference is becoming smaller and smaller. This is because these events may greatly expand Britain's power in the Mediterranean, which makes the Italian government feel very uneasy. (12th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Jerusalem Regarding the issue of the Arab race continuing the strike and boycotting the Jews, serious disputes have arisen within the Arab Higher Committee. Most of the responsible personnel of the Higher Committee disagree with extending the strike. This matter will be decided after consultations with the British High Commissioner to Palestine, Wauchope, tomorrow. It is generally believed that Iraqi Foreign Minister Nuri Said's previous mediation of the Palestinian ethnic dispute failed. Recently, Abdullah, President of the British-mandated Transjordan, may have come forward to mediate. (11th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Jerusalem According to unconfirmed reports, the Italian Consul in Palestine has warned local Italian residents to prepare to evacuate when necessary. The German Consul has also given the same warning to German residents. The unease among foreign residents in Palestine is due to the increasing intensity of conflicts between Arabs and British troops. So far, 815 people have died on both sides, including 34 British, 700 Arabs, and 81 Jews. The property loss is estimated at US$13,560,800. (11th National Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e49">There is Talk of Reconvening the World Economic Conference <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) International figures here expect that the governments of several countries will launch a proposal to convene a world economic conference, or a conference of the most industrialized countries with the greatest relationship with world trade, may also be held. It is also generally believed that France and countries such as Denmark, Sweden, and Norway will propose at this session of the League of Nations General Assembly to reconvene the disarmament conference to discuss the issue of reducing armaments. (11th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently issued an opinion paper on the world's economic situation. These opinions are attached to the League of Nations Secretariat's general report and submitted to the League of Nations Annual General Assembly, which opens on the 20th of this month, for discussion. The opinion paper stated that the world economic panic began in 1929 to 1931 and reached its highest point. After that, although the economic situation fluctuated, there has been a gradual trend of recovery. The industrial production index of the world in 1935 exceeded that of 1932 by 37%. The increase in industrial production this year was faster than that in 1934. It is often said that the current economic recovery is due to the increase in armaments in various countries. Avenol believes that this is not the case, because in most countries, industrial production had already been increasing before the government increased military spending, and the countries with the most significant economic recovery are not necessarily the countries with the largest military spending. It can be seen from this that the increase in industrial production is not significantly related to the expansion of armaments. It is believed that since the summer of 1936, world trade has obviously seen a sudden improvement. The total volume of world trade in the first half of 1936 increased by 3% compared with the same period last year, and the total value of world trade increased by 8% compared with the same period last year. The world price of goods also has a tendency to increase. In the future, as industry and commerce gradually improve, it will be easier to start sorting out the currencies of various countries. Since the paper currencies of various countries already have a tendency to stabilize in fact, it will be more and more smooth to sort out the currencies. (11th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Spain's Civil War Will Use Poison Gas? The Diplomatic Corps' Advice is Ineffective <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz It is now believed that poison gas will be used in the Spanish Civil War. Former Swedish Prime Minister Branting returned from Madrid today and said that the rebels are preparing to use asphyxiating gas to resist the government forces. It seems that the major powers are unlikely to try to prevent the use of poison gas in the civil war. Although the British government ordered Sir Chilton, the British ambassador to Spain, to convene a meeting of the diplomatic corps to consider the whole issue, it was unsuccessful. After yesterday's meeting, Dr. Betraqi, the Italian ambassador, said that it is impossible to handle this matter now because the Madrid government does not think that it should now reluctantly comply with the efforts of the diplomatic corps to humanize the civil war. In this situation, the diplomatic corps believes that it is useless to make any requests to the Burgos rebel government. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Hendaye According to refugees who arrived here today from San Sebastian, the city is completely surrounded on the land side. The rebels may attack at any time. San Sebastian has now become a hotly contested place in the civil war. It is heard that anarchists and Basque nationalists have started infighting in the city's streets. The rebel artillery is also bombing the suburbs. However, the rebels' general attack will not begin until tomorrow morning at the earliest. The 48-hour deadline for foreigners and citizens to leave the city will expire tomorrow morning. When the rebels break through the city in the future, they will find that no money or goods are left because they have all been confiscated by the government forces and transported to Bilbao by sea. Therefore, the residents of the city feel more and more precarious. At present, the rebels are still attacking Madrid as usual. (12th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Shen Liren Discusses Income Tax Collection: Foreign Nationals Should Pay Equally</p>
<p>Based on Legal Standing and the Principle of Equality, It Should Be Collected Equally from Chinese and Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>If Foreign Nationals Refuse, Protection Responsibility Can Be Relieved</p>
<p>New News Agency reports that after the Ministry of Finance decided to levy income tax on salaries and interest from October 1st, whether foreign nationals will be taxed equally has aroused widespread attention in society. A reporter from New News Agency specifically visited accountant Shen Liren, who shared his opinions as follows:</p>
<p>Central Government Decides to Tax Foreign Nationals</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, I have published in newspapers various questions regarding the collection of income tax from our citizens. Now, the central government has issued a document to the ambassadors of various countries in China, deciding to levy income tax on foreign businesses in China. We need to further study what the results will be. Currently, some people believe that the issue of collecting income tax from foreign nationals is not easy to resolve. If the Ministry of Finance authorities and the ambassadors of various countries in China cannot first reach a tacit understanding, then the collection of income tax in our country will not proceed smoothly. This view, while having considerable justification, will inevitably lead to serious problems if income tax is not collected from foreigners. In other words, if our country wants to successfully establish income tax, it must collect income tax from foreigners residing in China, just like our own citizens.</p>
<p>Taxation of British and American Enterprises in China</p>
<p>To make the issue easier to understand, let's first divide the foreign countries with extraterritorial rights in China into two categories: (1) Countries that have special provisions in their domestic income tax regulations regarding the income tax of their merchants in China; (2) Countries that have no special provisions. In the first category, there is only the United States, because it has a trade treaty with China that stipulates that American companies in China that are registered with the U.S. Commercial Counselor's Office under that treaty can deduct a portion of their income tax, which should be paid to the U.S. government. Aside from the United States, other countries with large investments in China can be categorized in the second category, such as Britain, France, and Japan. The U.S. income tax regulations promulgated in 1921 specifically included a section on trade with China, which is the aforementioned trade treaty. However, what is stipulated therein is clearly for American companies or firms operating in China and is unrelated to individual income. Therefore, Americans in China, except for a small portion who serve in institutions established by their government, have no income tax burden to any government, whether it is their home country or the country of residence. Companies operated by British merchants in China are divided into three categories based on their place of registration: (1) Those whose headquarters are registered in Britain, and their income tax is paid to the British government; (2) Those established in China, and their income tax should belong to China, but because our country has not collected income tax before, they do not pay it; (3) Those registered in Hong Kong, and they pay Hong Kong dollars four cents per hundred yuan of capital per year to the Hong Kong government. Apart from these three types, there are no tax rate regulations for individual British nationals.</p>
<p>International Taxation Situations</p>
<p>The tax payment situation of British and American merchants establishing businesses in China has been described above. In the past, other countries, whether companies or individuals, have not paid income tax in China. Now, let's observe the situation among major powers internationally, still taking Britain and the United States as examples. The U.S. income tax regulations, amended and implemented in 1932, stipulate that all investment or business income earned abroad (except in China) should be taxed by the local government. However, if the tax rate is lower than that set by the United States, the difference must be paid to the home country. If it is higher than the U.S. regulations, it cannot be deducted from the tax payable in the home country. For example, if an American company has a branch in Britain or owns shares in a British company, it must pay 25% of its income to the British government according to British income tax regulations. Because its tax rate is higher than that of the United States, the headquarters in the U.S. only needs to pay the tax due on its income in the home country. Conversely, if its branch is located in Canada, where the tax rate is lower, only 11%, while the U.S. rate is 13.75%, then the branch must pay the difference to the U.S. government. The United States uses this method for all countries, even if the income tax belongs to the local government or colony.</p>
<p>Tax Payment Standards for British and Japanese Merchants</p>
<p>Britain has detailed regulations regarding the income tax of its merchants abroad in the Finance Act promulgated in 1914. Before the passage of this law, income from any source abroad was not taxed. After the implementation of this law, income such as stocks and rent must be taxed by the home government. If the company established abroad has its management organization also located abroad, it is exempt from its income tax. It can be seen that the payment of income tax by British companies or individuals depends entirely on their location and management authority. Since the location of the company is closely related to tax payment, British merchants in China are happy to register with their consulates in order to avoid domestic taxation. The standards for payment in the Japanese income tax law are as follows: Article 1: Anyone who has a domicile in the place where this law is enforced or has resided there for more than one year is obligated to pay income tax in accordance with this law. Article 2: Those who do not meet Article 1 but meet the following conditions are only obligated to pay income tax on their income: (1) Those who have assets or operate businesses in the place where this law is enforced; (2) Those who obtain interest on public bonds, corporate bonds, or bank deposits, or interest on loans in the place where this law is enforced; (3) Those who receive distributions of profits or dividends from legal entities whose head offices or main business locations are located in the place where this law is enforced, or who enjoy remuneration or compensation-related payments from their profits or surplus.</p>
<p>Foreign Nationals Should Pay Income Tax</p>
<p>From the perspective of Japanese income tax, its foreign nationals should pay income tax to the country of residence. Foreign nationals of other countries in China, except for companies established by American merchants under the trade treaty, whether for profit income or new salary interest income, must comply with our country's income tax regulations. Conversely, if all countries with extraterritorial rights have special provisions for trade with China in their current income tax regulations, as the United States does, it may be difficult for our country to collect income tax from their nationals. However, in reality, there are no regulations stipulating that foreign nationals in China should pay income tax to their home countries. Therefore, based on the legal standing and the principle of equality, our country should collect income tax equally from Chinese and foreign nationals after opening the income tax. If foreign nationals use extraterritorial rights as a shield and refuse to pay the tax due, it is a fundamental violation of their own country's laws. Our tax collection agencies can file a lawsuit in the consular court of each country in accordance with the usual practice for debt recovery. If the ambassadors and consuls of various countries protect their merchants without punishment, our government can declare the responsibility for protecting foreign nationals and stop all the conveniences previously given to them. Under these circumstances, foreign nationals may suffer more losses than gains. Regarding the interpretation of the income tax regulations of the above countries and the reasons why foreign nationals should pay taxes equally, I have published an article in the local Western newspaper. If foreigners do not refute it, it can be considered that they implicitly agree with my opinion.</p>

<p>After the implementation of our country's new monetary system policy, the Ministry of Finance decided to reorganize the Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank in order to maintain the stability of the national currency. Minister Kong Xiangxi specially sent Dr. Shou Jingwei, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, to Japan in July of this year to investigate the banking system in order to prepare for the reorganization of our country's Central Bank into the Central Reserve Bank. Mr. Shou has returned to Shanghai on the Empress of Canada. A reporter from New Voice visited the Central Bank, and was told that Mr. Shou had spent two months in Japan, investigating the relationship between the Bank of Japan (i.e., the Central Bank of Japan) and special banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Hypothec Bank of Japan, Industrial Bank of Japan, Bank of Chosen, Bank of Taiwan, and ordinary banks, as well as the issue of international balance of payments. He was greatly supported by the parties involved. In addition to reporting the outline of this investigation to Minister Kong and Deputy President Chen in person, he is currently organizing the report and feels slightly overwhelmed. He will talk in detail when he has time. It is also learned that the Central Reserve Bank is determined to successfully reorganize this year.</p>
<p>Singapore Trade Show: Chambers of Commerce and Others Do Not Participate</p>
<p>Meeting Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>Because of Insufficient Time</p>
<p>The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce is sponsoring the Second National Products Exhibition and Sales Fair. It previously sent letters to manufacturers in various cities in China to participate. Now, because the opening is imminent, the chamber has specially sent Mr. Chen Zhensheng, manager of Jin Xing Company in Singapore, back to his home country to contact manufacturers in this city to participate in the event. The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and various national product organizations in this city held a welcome meeting at the executive office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 PM yesterday. The issue of participation was also discussed during the meeting. The meeting was chaired by Lin Kanghou. Representatives from participating groups included Lin Kanghou and Gu Huaibing from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Zhu Boyuan from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Chen Jingsheng from the International Trade Bureau, Xu Xiaochu from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall, Zhu Yutao from the Chinese National Product Manufacturers Association, Wang Xingyao from the Chinese National Product Production and Sales Association, Ni Hanru from the Southern Industrial Society, Shao Degong from Taikang Food Company, Zhang Baling from the Shanghai Machinery Industry Association, representatives from Xin Xin Gas Lamp Factory, Lao Shuangcheng Ironware Factory, Shao Fulin, Xu Mingde from Dachang Ivory Shop, Chen Guili from Zhongxing Trading Company, Wang Hanqiang from the Chinese National Product Maintenance Association, Zhang Huikang from the Shanghai National Product Movement Federation, Xu Jianruo from the Shanghai Citizens Promoting National Products Association, Xu Guojun from Yuanchang Leather Factory, Lu Xingzhuang and Sun Choucheng from the Shanghai National Product Factory Federation, and Jin Songtang from the Chinese Foreign Trade Association.</p>
<p>Welcome Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered the welcome speech, stating that he had previously visited Siam for inspection and met with the chairman of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce, who informed him that they were preparing to hold the Second National Products Exhibition and Sales Fair. Now, the chamber has specially sent Mr. Chen Zhensheng back to China to contact manufacturers in this city to participate, which is commendable for their enthusiasm in promoting national products. Then, Mr. Gu Huaibing reported on behalf of Mr. Chen the purpose of the Singapore exhibition and the local national product sales situation. Finally, Zhu Boyuan of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce reported on the process of convening a meeting of national product organizations after receiving the letter from the Singapore Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Unable to Participate</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether manufacturers would participate, the representatives at the meeting had a lengthy discussion. Finally, it was decided that they could not participate due to insufficient time and incomplete preparation of goods. As for the idea of entrusting Mr. Chen to take the goods there, it was also difficult to do because there was no stock. If the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce hosts the Third National Product Sales Fair in May next year, they will prepare a large quantity of goods to participate. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others will send a letter to the Singapore Chamber of Commerce regarding the above situation, which will be taken by Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>Korean Forges Central Bank Legal Tender</p>
<p>Case Already Cracked</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Daily, translated by External Review Agency, reports that Detective Sonoi of the Japanese Consulate Police Station in Shanghai received a report that there was a transaction of counterfeit banknotes taking place at the residence of Mr. Li of the Asia Trading Company, a Korean import and export merchant, at No. 48 North Sea Ning Road. At 4:00 PM on the 11th, he, along with detectives Lianwei and Kosano of the Disraeli Road Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police, went to the aforementioned residence and arrested two Korean men and one Korean woman who were negotiating the transaction on the spot. The homeowner, Mr. Li, was also taken to the Japanese Consulate Police Station as a reference person and is being seriously interrogated. At the time of the arrest, counterfeit five-yuan Central Bank banknotes worth 1,000 yuan were found on the Korean female suspect. There appears to be a powerful banknote counterfeiting group behind them.</p>
<p>Shanghai Inspector of Stamp Duty:</p>
<p>Ministry Transfers Shen Zhao for Reception</p>
<p>Has Arrived in Shanghai and Begun Inspection</p>
<p>The inspection of stamp duty in Shanghai was previously carried out by Li Lin and Lin Yuheng, appointed by the Ministry of Finance, who, together with inspection personnel, strictly enforced the regulations, and the stamp duty revenue increased significantly. It is now learned that after Lin Yuheng died of overwork, his vacancy was filled by Shen Zhao, Inspector of the Zhejiang Province, transferred by the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that Mr. Shen has arrived in Shanghai and has been contacting various relevant agencies in recent days and will soon begin earnest inspection with Mr. Li Lin to increase tax revenue.</p>
<p>Joint Sales and Marketing Corporation of Matches</p>
<p>Simultaneous Operation on the 16th</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Sends Special Commissioners to the Agency for Supervision</p>
<p>After the establishment of the head office of the China National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation and the Shanghai, Qingdao, and Tianjin branch offices, they have been scheduled to start business simultaneously on the 16th of this month. President Zhengda has telegraphed various branch offices to urge them to speed up preparations, but has not received a reply, and the date may be postponed by a few days. In Shanghai, the original organization of the Seven Provinces Joint Office will now be transferred to the Shanghai branch office. The amount of production and sales of each factory is allocated according to the average proportion of their production over the past few years, which has been agreed upon by the various branch offices. As for the selling price, it will be calculated based on the local situation, taking into account the cost of raw materials, manufacturing expenses, and transportation costs, and adding the lowest possible profit. The price in one place should not be increased or decreased. In order to protect the interests of consumers and prevent the company from monopolizing and raising prices, the Ministry of Finance has sent special commissioner Mr. Gao to the agency to supervise it.</p>
<p>Income Tax Collection Not Allowed to Be Postponed</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Responds to National Products Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Maintenance Association requested in July that the income tax, which the Ministry of Finance planned to collect from October 1st, should be collected only after all the miscellaneous taxes and levies in the provinces have been abolished in order to reduce the burden on the people. Yesterday, it received instruction No. 10661 from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the request to postpone the collection of income tax had been approved by the Executive Yuan and that the tax would be collected from October 1st, and that the request should not be discussed.</p>
<p>Chinese Iron Wire Factory</p>
<p>Holds Shareholders' Establishment Meeting</p>
<p>Shanghai Ningbo merchants Chen Jingtang, Zhang Songshan, and others, noting that iron wire is a practical item for society, needed in large quantities for tying ropes, making nets, and for various military and construction equipment, and that the iron wire sold on the market is all foreign goods, with no domestic iron wire available, in order to promote production and stop the leakage, organized a limited liability company last month to set up a factory in Shanghai for manufacturing. All shares were subscribed by the initiators. The shareholders' establishment meeting was held at the Zhengyi Society at 6:00 PM on the 10th, where the registration regulations were passed, directors and supervisors were elected, and the first shareholders' dinner party was held. This is a good phenomenon in the promotion of national products.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Reduce Rickshaws</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter Requesting Attention</p>
<p>Must Consider the Livelihoods of the Majority of Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the rickshaw industry association stating that the Municipal Council has once again proposed reducing the number of rickshaws and requesting that the chamber argue the case again. The chamber immediately sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating that the chamber had sent a letter to the council on June 17, stating that the proposal to reduce the number of rickshaws in the International Settlement would only be welcomed by a small number of well-off citizens, and would not consider the livelihoods of the approximately 100,000 workers in the settlement. The council is entrusted by more than one million Chinese and foreign citizens in the settlement, and all municipal facilities should be considered from the perspective of the largest number of citizens, especially the livelihoods of workers, which should not be ignored. The council's response, signed by Mr. He Kuide, stated that the council had received the chamber's letter of June 17 regarding the proposal to reduce rickshaws and that the council had taken note of it. Now, less than three months later, according to the association's report, another meeting has been scheduled to decide on reducing the number of rickshaws, which is still a policy of seeking convenience for tram and automobile companies and not considering the livelihoods of the majority of workers. Since the council is an organization entrusted by Chinese and foreign citizens to manage municipal affairs, the livelihoods of Chinese workers should be sympathized with and should not be placed below the convenience of the business of automobile and tram companies. Therefore, the chamber has no choice but to reiterate the letter sent to the council on June 17 and request that it be given close attention and to hope for a satisfactory and concrete reply.</p>
<p>North China Daily News Reports:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council's Financial Difficulties</p>
<p>Increasing Police Rate Difficult to Postpone Further</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council released its income and expenditure report for the first half of the year ending June 30th this week, which should be noted by all those concerned with the well-being of the International Settlement. The current budget for this semester is short by $225,792. In a year of recession, this is not unusual if added to the totals that are involved, but after careful study of the records in this report and a review of the previous years' reports, one needs to carefully reflect even if there is no cause to panic. The revenue item for the first half of this year exceeds half of the estimated amount of the entire year by $200,000, but the $270,000 carried over from 1935 has already been spent, and the miscellaneous income items included in the budget total $636,640, including the interest accumulated in the sinking fund. Therefore, the income item for the second half of the year must be reduced by these two items, totaling $900,000. To estimate the possible results for the whole year, one must take into account the shortage of $300,000 estimated in the budget for the total amount that can be collected from the police rate, license tax, and public and municipal enterprises. Given the current market situation, there may not be any turning point in the short term. Therefore, the final result for this year is likely to be short by about $1.25 million, which will have to be made up for by the revenue from next year. This will make it even more difficult to balance the budget for next year. It should be noted that this year's budget already requires $2 million to be allocated from the public reserve fund to balance the budget. If this amount is also needed next year, then $3.25 million will be needed to balance the budget for next year.</p>
<p>How did the Municipal Council's finances reach this state? By studying the income and expenditure reports it has published and the annual reports published by the accountant, it is easy to get to the truth. In the past, Shanghai's commerce was developing rapidly, and the population was expanding frequently. Therefore, the Municipal Council's revenue increased year by year, allowing it to gradually expand municipal administration to facilitate the taxpayers of the settlement. Today's state is caused by the recession, and another important factor is that some municipal expansions cost too much. The Municipal Council sold the electricity department, which allowed it to increase the police force urgently needed to protect residents without increasing the police rate. At the same time, it was able to implement an expanded education program, mainly to facilitate the children of Chinese people in the settlement. In addition, the health department and the public works department have also greatly increased their scale. A comparison of the cost of these items in 1928 and 1936 is listed below, which can give a glimpse of the situation:</p>
<p>1928 1936</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps 217,639 690,140</p>
<p>Police Force 4,504,163 9,901,640</p>
<p>Education Department 775,656 1,740,400</p>
<p>Health Department 1,183,92 2,106,60</p>
<p>Public Works Department 3,569,212 5,372,490</p>
<p>The Municipal Council did not obtain the increased expenses by increasing the tax rate or taking them from the public. Instead, it reduced the police rate from 16% to 14% in 1930. However, since 1930, the Municipal Council's regular income has been insufficient to cover its expenses, which is something that the general public may not fully know. In these years, the amounts insufficient in 1930 and 1931 were made up for by the huge amount remaining in 1929. Since 1932, it has been necessary to allocate approximately $9 million from the public reserve fund each year to make up for the shortfall. However, this public reserve fund is not inexhaustible. If there is no further austerity or no public reserve fund, then even if the police rate is restored to 16%, it will not be enough to balance the budget. The Municipal Council does not have the freedom of the National Government to expand its tax base. It can only find ways to increase revenue from the existing taxes or reduce the expenses of various municipal affairs to make up for the shortfall. In the past four or five years, the Municipal Council's administrative expenses have already been greatly reduced. Now, there is a subcommittee investigating the possibility of continuing to seek economic efficiency among the Municipal Council's staff. What is gratifying is that the Municipal Council's capital position is now very solid. Judging from the report, the long-term and short-term debts it owes total $39,692,284, and there is a sinking fund of $9,507,889 to offset them. Therefore, the net debt is slightly more than $30 million, and the land and buildings owned by the Municipal Council alone are worth $66,788,775. Therefore, the Municipal Council's credit is very good, and it is easier to raise funds whenever it decides to do so. However, this factor cannot be used to satisfactorily solve the problem of balancing the regular budget. Not only that, but the strict control over the use of capital at present may have an adverse impact if it is relaxed slightly. From the above situation, since the current 14% police rate is not enough to maintain today's municipal organs, increasing the police rate is difficult to postpone further. Otherwise, the public amenities that are considered important will have to be reduced.</p>
<p>Chinese Seamen's Union:</p>
<p>Reorganization of Guangzhou Branch Ready</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xiaotian, Special Commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Union, believes that since the military, political, party affairs, and finances of Guangdong are all unified, the Guangdong Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Assembly, which is an irregular organization, should be reorganized by sending personnel to carry out the reorganization. He specially followed the instructions of the central government and selected Mr. Wang Jiyi, secretary and design committee member of the union, to go to Guangzhou to conduct an on-the-spot inspection, discuss the reorganization methods and personnel issues with the local party and government authorities. Mr. Wang returned to Shanghai to report, and after careful consideration by Special Commissioner Yang, in order to adapt to the environment and facilitate the work, he first reorganized the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial United General Assembly into the Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Union, and appointed Huang Huilong, Zai Oumin, Liang Guoying, Chen Zhang, Chen Shujing, Huang Yushu, Zhou Lin, Ma Bolin, Ge Zhaoji, and others as members of the preparatory committee of the branch, and designated Huang, Wang, and Liang as standing committee members.

<p>Lawyer Ji Yi Released on Bail</p>
<p>Case Involves Planning Speculative Business</p>
<p>Turned Himself in and Offered to Collect and Return Money</p>
<p>Wang Hua, the former county magistrate, recently filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Ji Yi, a lawyer from Anhui who resides at No. 13 Min Village, Mintiniyin Road, and has withdrawn from the association, of defrauding him of 1,500 yuan as capital for the Gold Industry Exchange. It is alleged that in early December of the 23rd year, the defendant told the plaintiff that Li Zhukui was skilled in the gold industry and planned to raise funds to operate, but lacked capital, and begged the plaintiff to advance 1,500 yuan, promising to return it within one month. The plaintiff believed it to be true and paid the defendant 1,500 yuan in three installments and signed a contract. The receipt was issued by the defendant, stating that the business would start in January of the 24th year. However, it was delayed for four or five months without being implemented. When the plaintiff negotiated with the defendant, the defendant claimed that Li had left Shanghai due to some matter and that the business could start in another month. Later, in June, the plaintiff met Li Zhukui on Belle Road, who replied that the defendant said that it was difficult to raise funds and had taken back the contract. Afterwards, the plaintiff repeatedly negotiated with the defendant to recover the money, but the defendant moved his residence and avoided meeting him. He requested an investigation. The court summoned the defendant based on the complaint, but the defendant did not appear, and the court ordered a postponement. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengham continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant turned himself in. The plaintiff stated as above. The defendant confessed that Yu Qianzhi, a member of my Zhou's social circle, introduced Li Zhukui, Qian Anlan, Wang Zhenhua, and others to my place as social members. At that time, Yu said that Li was skilled in the gold industry and had no capital to operate. He planned to raise funds for the business, and the plaintiff advanced 1,500 yuan. We five people signed a contract. I was responsible for managing the money. After the plaintiff paid the money, I gave Yu 300 yuan and went to the exchange with Li Zhukui to operate. I also paid Qian Anlan 450 yuan to operate. Because it could not continue, the plaintiff asked me to return the advance money. Because Yu and Qian had already taken 750 yuan, I asked the three parties to hand over the money at the same time to make up the original amount of 1,500 yuan to return to the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff insisted that I be solely responsible for handing over the money, which led to the delay until today and the inability to resolve the matter. The court verified the confession and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 19th. The defendant was ordered to provide a guarantor who would be available upon summons, and Mi Nalu Ruliang was brought to court.</p>
<p>Seized Bullets and Handgun During Arrest of Lu Ruliang</p>
<p>Lu Ruliang, a 32-year-old bandit from Chongming, was hiding in Zhu Jiazhai, Pei Dong. After Detective Liu Guangjun, leader of the Detective Squad of the Ximen Branch Bureau, learned of this, he led team leaders Xu Chengyu and Yu Ruhai, and detective Chen Mian, fully armed, to the aforementioned location at 10:00 PM last night, together with the police chief of the Pudong Branch Bureau, and arrested the suspect Lu on the spot. A handgun and four bullets were seized on the spot. He was taken to the bureau for interrogation and to track down his accomplices.</p>

<p>In the Case of Hide Hideo Nakayama, Kim Dokwon Claims No Involvement</p>
<p>Detailed Confession of Huakezhi's Assassination Plan</p>
<p>Police Station Does Not Prosecute Zhu Guisheng and Others</p>
<p>Yang Wendao and Others to Continue Trial Next Wednesday</p>
<p>Hide Hideo Nakayama, a Japanese sailor, and Kizo Kayao, a Japanese resident, were shot and killed one after another. Last month, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau arrested three suspects, Zhu Guisheng, Chen Enming, and Kim Dokwon, at the Jiande Apartment on North Sichuan Road. Zhang Shimin (also known as Zhang Yuhua and Zhang Wei), a major criminal wanted in the assassination case in the capital, was identified as the mastermind. Detectives were sent to Beijing to transfer Zhang to Shanghai. Subsequently, the Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession transferred the four men to the First Special District Court on the grounds that Yang Wendao, Ye Haisheng, Zhou Sherong, and others had already been arrested in connection with the sailor's murder case. The court was presided over by Judge Xiao Xieben on the afternoon of the previous day for investigation and interrogation. By evening, only Zhu, Chen, and Zhang had been interrogated.</p>
<p>Kim Dokwon</p>
<p>was interrogated separately by Judge Xiao and Prosecutor Tang in the Third Tribunal yesterday morning, with Zhu, Chen, and Zhang also present. Kim gave a detailed account of the assassination plan of Huakezhi and others, but denied any involvement in the killing of the Japanese sailor. According to Kim Dokwon, 19 years old, originally from Jiangbei Zerenying, lives at No. 293 Julieta Road. He was a clerk in an internal and external cotton spinning factory, but has been unemployed for two years. Although Zhang Shimin had been to my house once before, Zhu Guisheng and Chen Enming only met me a month before the arrest. When the Japanese sailor was killed, I lived on Robert Road, and I was a runner for a bank on Jiujiang Road. Therefore, there is</p>
<p>Absolutely No Involvement</p>
<p>I was only hired by Huakezhi in July and only did trivial things such as conveying messages. Liu Lao Si is a member of Huakezhi's gang, about 27 or 28 years old, with a Shandong accent, living in Xiaotaoyuan Lane. On the afternoon of July 10, I was at Liu's house in the late afternoon, when Huakezhi visited Liu with a small leather suitcase. He then spoke to Liu in whispers by the window. I only heard Hu say "can hold six bullets." I paid attention to it, but they spoke in a lower voice, so I didn't hear anything more. I only saw Hua open the box and hand something to Liu, who hid it in his chest. I only saw one end of it, which looked like the handle of a pistol. The two of them then went out together. Hua specifically told me not to go to Liu's house for the next few days.</p>
<p>Reading the Newspaper the Next Day</p>
<p>I learned that a Japanese man (Kayao) had been killed on Kimme Road. I was driven by curiosity and took the newspaper to Liu's house to ask if he had done it. Liu looked pleased and smiled without answering, which made me suspect that the Japanese man was killed by them. On the 20th, Huakezhi ordered me to send 20 yuan to Zhu Guisheng so that Zhu could rent a house and buy things. I met Chen Enming at Zhu's house. On August 3, Hua and Zhu went to an apartment on North Sichuan Road and opened a room. I also went with them. Hua opened a room in the apartment to plan the murder of the Japanese. Hua originally planned to start on August 8, so on the evening of the 7th, he specifically sent me to the apartment to ask Zhu Guisheng if he was ready. The method they planned to carry out was for Shi Fengting to do the shooting, Chen Enming to assist, and Zhu Guisheng to take care of everything. At that time, Shi said that he would listen to the boss's orders (referring to Huakezhi) and would proceed as soon as the boss ordered him to do so. However, Chen Enming said that the chosen</p>
<p>Execution Location</p>
<p>on North Sichuan Road was not stable and needed to be chosen elsewhere, so it was not carried out on the 8th. I once asked Hua on the morning of the 8th what the purpose of killing the Japanese man was. Hua said that he wanted to start a Sino-Japanese war, but he never mentioned the Nakayama Hideo and Kayao cases to me, and Zhu, Chen, and others never said a word. Therefore, I really don't know whether those two cases were done by them. What I said in the Public Security Bureau about the pistol was all nonsense. On the morning of the 10th, Hua sent me 60 yuan to the apartment and ordered me to ask Zhu, Chen, Shi, and others what they were doing. If they were willing to do it, they should proceed as soon as possible. If they were still hesitant, they should bring the money back. As soon as I arrived at the apartment, before I could hand over the money, I was</p>
<p>Arrested Together</p>
<p>with Zhu and Chen. Zhu and I moved</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Explains Examination Questions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has approved a request from the Gansu Provincial Government, stating that the Education Department, according to a report from Gansu Provincial Wuwei Middle School, stated that students who failed the Civics subject in the previous vocational school examination should take a make-up exam in this session according to the examination regulations. However, it was recently found that the Civics subject is not included in this session's regulations for the examination. The school requested instructions on how to handle this. The Ministry of Education found that the examination subjects promulgated this year do not include Civics or Biology in junior high school, nor Civics, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, History, or Geography in senior high school, nor Civics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Physics, History, Geography, or Educational Psychology in normal schools. If students who failed one or two subjects in the previous examination that are not included in this year's regulations are not given a chance to take a make-up exam, it may hinder their future. If they are instructed to participate in the next examination according to the regulations, but there is no such subject in the future regulations, the following methods are proposed based on the previous situation: Students who failed the previous examination will still participate in the next examination according to the previous regulations. If the subject of the make-up exam is a subject included in the future regulations, they will participate in the make-up exam for that subject according to the regulations. If the subject failed is a subject included in the previous examination but not included in the future regulations, the examination committee should prepare separate test questions and allocate time for the students who failed that subject to take a make-up exam during the examination period. The Ministry of Education replied that if students who failed one or two subjects in the previous examination, and those subjects are not included in this year's examination subjects, they should prepare separate test questions and allocate time for a make-up exam during the examination period, as proposed by the government.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Approves Jiangsu Province's Flexible Vocational School Transfer Policy</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department stated that the province's vocational school transfer policy is based on the regulations of the Ministry of Education, and follows the provisions of Chapter 10 of the regulations for middle schools and normal schools. However, the department recently found that the requirement that the transferring students must be in the same major is difficult to implement. It specially requested the Ministry of Education to approve a flexible policy that allows students who have completed one semester of ordinary junior or senior high school to transfer to the first semester of the first year of an equivalent vocational school. However, vocational school students are still not allowed to transfer to ordinary middle schools or normal schools, in order to show restrictions. It has now been instructed by the Ministry of Education: "The request is approved as proposed. However, the vocational schools that accept transfer students must have a study period of three years, and the transfer students must have passing grades in all major subjects in their original school semesters." The Education Department has issued the order to the relevant authorities.</p>

<p>Aurora University Held the Inauguration Ceremony of the New School Building and Library Yesterday; A French Book Exhibition Was Held at the Same Time; More Than 1,000 Chinese and French People Attended</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony of the new school building and library of Aurora University was held at 4:00 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the West Campus on Lujun Road. A French book exhibition was held at the same time. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, French Consul General Bodes, and more than 1,000 Chinese and French people attended. The ceremony was simple. After the ceremony, the school building and the exhibition were visited. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education and others sent congratulatory messages. The grand occasion is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>The ceremony was held in the school auditorium. The national flags of China and France were hung at the entrance of the school. The students of the school stood respectfully at the entrance to receive guests. Boy Scouts were stationed on both sides of the hall and on the roadside to maintain order. The French military band played music at the scene. The guests arrived and gathered in the hall one after another. When the ceremony began, they entered the hall in an orderly manner. The building of the hall is spacious and elegant. Calligraphy and mirror screens presented by various parties are hung around the hall. The party and national flags are hung on the rostrum, and the flags of China and France are hung on both sides. The ceremony began with the singing of the Chinese Kuomintang party song and the French national anthem. After the music, the school's director gave an opening speech, followed by a speech by French Consul General Bodes. Then, Principal Hu Wenyao gave a report, saying that he was very honored to have everyone present. The school was first established in Xujiahui and moved here 28 years ago. The school buildings have gradually expanded. What is completed today is only one-third of the entire plan. In the future, we will work hard under the supervision of the Ministry of Education and local officials, so that the construction can start as soon as possible, and the various facilities can be improved day by day.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu said, Principal Hu, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, today is the inauguration ceremony of the new school building and library of Aurora University. I, Tiecheng, am honored to participate in the grand event. I would like to express my sincerity and represent the citizens of the city to offer my congratulations. Aurora University not only has a very long history in China, but is also a high-level institution of higher learning that connects Chinese and French culture. Culture is the product of the common efforts of mankind. It not only cannot have national boundaries, but also depends on mutual learning and exchange in order to develop. China is the cultural nation with the longest history in the world, and French academic culture also has a lofty position in Europe and the world. I believe that the cooperation between these two talented cultural nations will make a very great and unlimited contribution to world culture and the evolution of mankind in the future. In recent years, the number of young Chinese people studying in France has been increasing day by day, and French masterpieces are often translated and published in the Chinese publishing industry. At the same time, we have also heard that the famous French university, the University of Paris, has a Chinese academy. This symbol of cultural cooperation is really gratifying. The development of libraries in education and culture is certainly very important. Therefore, in Shanghai, a municipal library with a relatively large scale has recently been established. Last year, the French side donated many valuable books to the Oriental Library. I have not dared to forget this spirit of cooperation until today. The completion of the Aurora University Library will benefit the scholars in the future, which is not shallow. At the same time, the French book exhibition held today is full of dazzling things, which is very beautiful. It will certainly increase the Chinese people's understanding of French academic culture. Today's grand event is full of the spirit of Chinese-French cultural cooperation. I am very happy to be able to participate. Aurora University has always been known for its efforts in Chinese-French cultural cooperation. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to express my hope that Aurora University students will continue to work towards this goal, promote cultural exchange between the two countries, and complete their lofty and great mission for the future of the entire human culture. Finally, Bishop Hui delivered a speech, and the ceremony ended at 5:00 PM.</p>

<p>The nine reform plans proposed by the association were passed at the annual meeting a few days ago. Some of them have been modified. The association notified the teams yesterday and added a few points as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The last paragraph of Article 6 should be supplemented with "All registered players of member teams can join the league or the Sunday Morning League. If unregistered players are found to participate in the competition, or registered players participate in other league competitions, the competition will be cancelled and the players will be punished."</p>
<p>(2) The entire text of Article 7 should be supplemented as "All member teams can join the league (Group A, B, C) and the Sunday Morning League. However, those who have been designated to participate in the Morning League cannot join the league again, and those who have been designated to join the league cannot join the Morning League again (i.e., Group B and C teams are only allowed to choose one type of competition, which is different from Group A teams, which can join the reserve team competition.)</p>
<p>(3) In the middle paragraph of Article 9, the sentence "The chairman of the league committee should be elected by the executive committee by voting method" should be added. (According to the following text, the powers of the league committee do not have the right to interfere with administration, but must report to the executive committee for processing. However, half of the six league committee members are produced by the executive committee, and now the chairman is also stipulated to be elected by the executive committee, then the three people elected by the teams in each group have no hope at all, and even if they do, it is equal to a virtual setting due to the regulations of power, and there is also an appeals committee to handle disputes.)</p>
<p>Key Points of Changes to Football Rules</p>
<p>The secretariat notified all member teams yesterday that the association has now accepted the recommendations of the referee association. According to the 1936-37 referee manual of the British Football Association, there are important changes to the football rules, which have been decided to be implemented this season. The key points of the changes are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When the goalkeeper holds the ball in his hand, the player can make a legal foul, but cannot kick or make a gesture of preparing to kick with his feet. If a player is found to have this kind of indecent behavior, the referee may punish him.</p>
<p>(2) The referee has the right to sanction illegal behavior of players from the time the whistle blows to start the game until the end of the game. (This article was decided at the international conference on June 13 this year, and it is noted in the referee's memorandum that "The referee shall not discuss or argue about the judgment on or off the field.")</p>
<p>The above two articles are changes in the referee's manual, and teams are notified to pay attention.</p>
<p>(3) Article 1 of Chapter 7 of the rules should be changed to "When kicking a goal kick, the ball should be kicked directly out of the penalty area," and explained as follows: When kicking a goal kick, in the past, another player could pick it up into the goalkeeper's hand, and then the goalkeeper would kick it out. Now, the ball must be kicked out directly. If its distance does not exceed the penalty area, the referee will declare a re-kick, but it cannot be kicked twice in a row. If it is violated, an arbitrary ball will be penalized."</p>
<p>(4) Article 1 of Chapter 10 of the rules is revised to the following regulations: When executing an arbitrary ball, the penalized player must not stand closer than ten yards from the ball, but those who are in the goal line between the goalposts are not limited. The full meaning of "Goal Line" includes the end line from the "corner flag" to the other "corner flag", so players can stand at any point on the end line. However, when it is implemented in the future, if there is a "free kick in front of the goal" (hitting the robber's fence ball), the defending team members can only gather at the end line under the goal.</p>
<p>(5) Article 12 of the rules makes clearer regulations on the restrictions on football shoes, and states that football shoes are not allowed to be equipped with iron nails (except leather and cork).</p>
<p>(6) Article 12 of the rules, "If a player leaves the field for some reason, and is late after the game has started, if he does not report to the referee when entering the field, he must be warned after being discovered by the referee. If the game is temporarily suspended due to the warning, it will be restarted in accordance with Rule 16 (i.e., the opposing team will continue the game with an out-of-bounds ball.) If the player commits a more serious foul, he will be punished in accordance with the rules.</p>
<p>The above changes to the rules will be implemented from this season.</p>
<p>American Singles Tennis Championship; Panlai Bobqi Obtains the Right to the Final; Victory or Defeat is Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>Linshan, USA, 11th Reuters The American Singles Tennis Championship will be decided by a final between Panlai and Bobqi. The results of today's semi-finals are as follows:</p>
<p>The final between Bobqi and Lai is bound to be an extremely tense match. In the Wimbledon semi-finals, Panlai eliminated Bobqi, but in the Anglo-American Cup trial, Bobqi defeated Panlai, so it is difficult to predict the victory or defeat of the two in the final. In the women's singles semi-finals, Ms. Jekoba overcame her strong opponent, Ms. Stanmer of England, 6-4, 6-3. Ms. Marbul defeated Peterson 6-1, 6-1.</p>

<p>Engineer's Honor After the Closing of the World Games; Government Awards Professor Title</p>
<p>(Berlin Dispatch) Recently, the German Ministry of the Interior, in order to reward the engineer Max, who was the architect of the Olympic Games venue, specially awarded the title of professor.</p>
<p>The representatives and spectators from various countries participating in this year's Olympic Games have an indelible image of the construction of this meeting venue. The neat oval shape, simple and clear lines, majestic clock tower, clear green swimming pool, and the color-coordinated Dieqiai Kate outdoor theater are all pleasing to the eye. The drawings designed by Max were handed over to the government engineer Shibenhall for construction, with 2,500 workers, totaling 2.5 million working days. The materials used for construction include 30,500 tons of hewn stone, 17,200 tons of cement, and 5,000 kilometers of wire. Many barren lands have benefited from it, and countless long-unused stone mines have been excavated. Bluestone comes from Washburg, granite comes from Selshire and eastern Bavaria, igneous rock comes from Eiffel, and marble comes from Selshire. 100 acres of grassland are laid in the venue. This project has set a new world record. Finnish long-distance runner Isuholo also praised the track.</p>

<p>Canada</p>
<p>Uruguay</p>
<p>(6) (1) Record of the Basketball Final</p>
<p>Champion United States; Runner-up Canada</p>
<p>Third Place Mexico; Fourth Place Poland</p>
<p>Fifth Place Philippines; Sixth Place Uruguay</p>
<p>After a week of fierce battles and successive eliminations, the six teams remaining in the basketball championship held the final on the 14th afternoon. As a result, the United States defeated Canada and won the championship. Canada won the runner-up, and Mexico defeated Poland, ranking third and fourth respectively. The Philippines overcame Uruguay, ranking fifth and sixth respectively.</p>
<p>The rules used in this conference's basketball game, in the first and second weeks, were a double elimination system, allowing those who failed to have the opportunity to improve. In the third week, a knockout system was used. The results of the fourth week of competition left only four teams. Therefore, the four teams that failed were able to compete again in the fifth week, in order to produce the fifth and sixth places. This competition method can already be said to be relatively fair, but it is still inevitable that there will be luck and opportunity. For example, the Philippines defeated Mexico in the second week, but now Mexico is ranked third, and the Philippines is ranked fifth. Also, Japan defeated Poland in the second week, but unfortunately was eliminated by Mexico in the third week and failed to make the list, while Poland is ranked fourth. The Chinese team was really unfortunate this time. If all the team members could have exerted their inherent strength and calmly responded to the battle, they would have had a chance to win after defeating Peru in the second week, being idle in the third week, and meeting Poland in the fourth week. In the end, they could have competed with Mexico for third and fourth place. Even if they lost to Poland, they could have competed with Uruguay in the fifth week, and then competed with the Philippines for fifth and sixth place. However, this very good opportunity was easily missed. It is sad to talk about it, so let's not mention it. The three finals were originally scheduled to be held continuously in the largest basketball court from 4:00 PM on the 14th. Anyone who understands basketball would not want to give up such a continuous good show, so 3,000 people gathered in the calm and quiet basketball court. Who knew that God was joking and it rained heavily for two hours, reducing the brilliance of two important games.</p>
<p>Although it had drizzled slightly on the 14th afternoon, by 3:30, there was an intention to clear up. When the players of the Philippines and Uruguay had finished practicing their shots, taken off their coats, and lined up to fight, it suddenly rained heavily and the cold wind was piercing. It did not stop until the game between Mexico and Poland was over and the United States and Canada took to the court to fight. Although the open-air court was paved with very good red sand, it was muddy in an instant because of the heavy rain. The players stumbled and fell, and performed a three-legged iron rooster, making countless jokes. Everyone became Wuxi clay dolls, which was extremely humorous. Only a very small number of the 3,000 fans in the stands had umbrellas to shelter them from the rain, and they were drenched for two hours, which was commendable for their courage, but they all became drowned rats, which was really embarrassing. Fortunately, the rain had stopped when the final game between the United States and Canada was being played, and it was moved to another venue to compete. It was full of brilliance, and everyone was finally satisfied and compensated for their losses.</p>
<p>The Philippines Overcame Uruguay; The Game between the Philippines and Uruguay Started at 4:00 PM; Because the Rain Was Too Heavy, the Court Was Slippery, the Ball Was Heavy, and Running Was Difficult; There Was Simply No Technique to Speak Of; However, Both Teams Strove for Honor and Did Not Relax at All; The Fight Was Extremely Serious; It Was Also Fun</p>
<p>Both teams lined up and started fighting. However, because the court was slippery and the ball was heavy, the shots were not accurate. After persevering for three minutes, each had nothing to show for it. Philippines right forward Patira received support from the defender, carefully aimed, and shot from a distance with both hands, first opening the scoring. Uruguay's left forward Piezui Comance responded in kind, tying the score 2-2. Burke made his first move under the basket, putting the Philippine army in the lead again. Comance refused to be outdone and fired from a distance, 4-4, tying the score again. Burke's pass was just right. Patira did a somersault under the basket. Burke also lived up to his mission, 8-4, the Philippine army took the lead. Breesly couldn't contain his anger and rushed into the Philippine camp, scoring and returning. Then he scored from a distance, 8-8, creating a balance again. Patira and Martinez colluded with each other, and successively shot through the Uruguayan net. Laulisly was unwilling to let go, and used his skills on both sides, 12-12, still shoulder to shoulder, which made the 3,</p>

<p>Shen Bao Children's Supplement Back to School in Autumn! Children, Hurry and Study Hard!</p>
<p>Autumn Lad</p>
<p>Dear Children:</p>
<p>Time passes like flowing water. The summer vacation is now over, and autumn has brought the start of the new school term. I imagine you are all picking up your schoolbags and heading off to school? I think: After a long absence, you will be reunited with your kind teachers and dear classmates, sharing conversations and experiencing joy, adding much interest to your lives!</p>
<p>However, during this long summer vacation, I imagine that perhaps you have been tempted by the heat or lured by entertainment, and have gradually forgotten the lessons taught by your teachers in the previous semester (although there are diligent children who continue to review at home, they are likely few in number). Now, you should quickly seek remedial measures! You must swiftly identify the areas you have forgotten in your textbooks and seek detailed guidance from your teachers, memorizing and understanding them diligently! Otherwise, if you haven't fully grasped the knowledge and learning from the previous semester and then go on to listen to new lessons this semester, gaining new knowledge while forgetting the old, what is the point?</p>
<p>Moreover, in these extraordinary times, with industry and commerce declining and the countryside collapsing, you children are the masters of the future and bear the significant mission of reviving the nation and saving it from peril! Therefore, during this period of learning, you should make extraordinary efforts in all your studies, hoping to achieve profound accomplishments. When you grow up, you will naturally be able to serve society, seek happiness for the masses, and bring glory to the country!</p>
<p>Insects</p>
<p>Zhen</p>
<p>Late summer and early autumn are when insects are most active, so Min'er is very busy catching them. Every day he hides in the garden to find their traces, and at night he takes a palm-leaf fan to the river to catch fireflies. During the day, he often catches crickets in the corners of walls and among the rubble. He knows very well not to harm dragonflies, because they are beneficial to people. During the day, he carries a cigarette tin and a net for catching crickets. Before long, he returns fully loaded. He is very skilled at catching crickets because he has sharp eyes and quick movements. One day, he caught a cricket and looked at it closely. This was the first time he had observed one carefully, because he had never looked at one clearly before. After this observation, many questions arose:</p>
<p>"Brother, is this cicada an insect? How can you tell?"</p>
<p>"Cicadas are insects. It's easy to tell! (1) An insect's body is divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen, and each of these parts is made up of many segments. (2) The head has a pair of antennae, two compound eyes, and several simple eyes. What are compound eyes? Look! Doesn't the cicada have two big eyes on its head? If you look closely, you'll see many small dots in those big eyes. These small dots are small eyes. In short, a large eye made up of many small eyes is called a compound eye. So, if you want to know if an animal is an insect, just see if it has compound eyes. It's very easy. (3) The thorax is made up of three segments, and each segment has a pair of legs, so three segments have six legs. There are usually two pairs of wings above the thorax. (4) Insects don't have skeletons. Their bodies are covered with a kind of chitinous skin, which is called an exoskeleton. (5) Insects are all oviparous. But these are the general characteristics of insects. Because there are so many kinds of insects, there are bound to be exceptions."</p>
<p>"How many kinds of insects are there?"</p>
<p>"There are many kinds of insects, accounting for about seven-tenths of the entire animal kingdom. There are already more than sixty thousand named species. Isn't that a staggering number? Insects are also commonly divided into eight kinds based on their mouthparts, wings, and the way they metamorphose: (1) Orthoptera: They have two pairs of wings and three pairs of legs. The third pair of legs is very long, so they can jump. The larvae and adults look very similar, like locusts. (2) Lepidoptera: Their bodies are covered with many scales, they have two large pairs of wings, and they also have three pairs of legs. Their mouths are like thin tubes, usually coiled under their heads. When they use them, they extend them to suck nectar. When they are larvae, they look like caterpillars, like butterflies. (3) Hymenoptera: They also have two pairs of wings, but the wings are very transparent. They also have three pairs of legs. Their mouths can bite hard things. The larvae sometimes look like maggots and sometimes like caterpillars, like bees. (4) Coleoptera: They also have two pairs of wings. The first pair of wings is very hard, and the second pair is soft and thin. The larvae look like silkworms, like longhorn beetles. (5) Diptera: They only have one pair of wings and three pairs of legs. Their mouths are sometimes like tongues and sometimes like needles. The larvae don't have legs and look like maggots, like flies and mosquitoes. (6) Rhynchophora: They have two pairs of wings, six legs, and their mouths are like snouts, making it easy to absorb plant sap, like cicadas. (7) Neuroptera: Their bodies are very slender, and they have two pairs of transparent, gauze-like wings. The three pairs of legs are on the underside of the thorax. Their mouths can chew things, and their antennae are very short, like dragonflies. (8) Collembola: They are the lowest of the insects. They have two pairs of gills on their heads. They only have simple eyes beside their heads and no compound eyes. Their bodies are very small and mostly flat, and they have no wings. The ends of their tails have whip-like or sword-like appendages, making it easy for them to jump, so they are called springtails. Silverfish belong to this category. We can often find them in old books."</p>
<p>World Aircraft Production by Major Powers</p>
<p>Zhaifu</p>
<p>When there are too many eagles, birds are no longer safe in the forest; when whales and sharks become too numerous, fish are no longer safe in the water; when iron birds fly, humans are no longer safe on the ground. The more unsafe humans feel, the more they need to find ways to protect their own countries' security. To ensure the security of one's country, it is necessary to strengthen the ability to resist external enemies. Today, which country isn't competing to expand its air force? Convenient transportation depends on the development of the aviation industry; comparing national strength depends on the number of aircraft.</p>
<p>It is worth our attention to understand the current number of aircraft produced by various countries.</p>
<p>England: Has thirty-five aircraft manufacturing plants. Fourteen of these plants specialize in manufacturing military aircraft.</p>
<p>France: Has thirty-two aircraft plants. All are subsidized by the government.</p>
<p>Germany: Has seventeen aircraft plants. The largest of these employs 15,000 workers.</p>
<p>Soviet Union: Has eleven aircraft plants. Produces 2,000 aircraft per year.</p>
<p>Italy: Produces one hundred fighter planes per month.</p>
<p>Japan: Has seven military aircraft manufacturing plants.</p>
<p>United States: In the past year (1935), manufactured 459 military aircraft.</p>
<p>In recent years, in our country, amid calls for saving the nation through aviation, the number of aircraft manufactured domestically is very limited. Most aircraft are purchased from foreign countries. Therefore, the urgent task at hand, in addition to developing aviation talent and purchasing aircraft, is to find ways to manufacture them ourselves, in order to produce them in large quantities. This is a long-term plan for the nation.</p>
<p>Scientific Questions</p>
<p>Why is Riding a Bicycle Easier Than Walking?</p>
<p>Zixi</p>
<p>Everyone knows that cars are less strenuous than walking because gasoline engines are doing the walking for people. But riding a bicycle is entirely powered by human effort, and walking is also powered by human effort. Why is riding a bicycle less strenuous than walking, even though both use human power? We know that climbing a mountain is much more strenuous than walking on flat ground because the Earth's gravity pulls people towards the center of the Earth, but people stubbornly resist this force and climb up the mountain. Naturally, this is very strenuous. Walking on flat ground doesn't involve moving towards the center of the Earth, but it also doesn't involve resisting its force by climbing. Therefore, walking is less strenuous than climbing a mountain. When riding a bicycle, the body naturally remains stable and still. On the one hand, you are not resisting gravity, and on the other hand, when walking, you always move forward with a jolt. This upward jolt is like climbing a mountain, resisting gravity. People who ride bicycles don't have this jolting motion, so it's naturally less strenuous. However, with current bicycles, riders still have to use some force, because the friction between the axles and the wheels inevitably requires human power. I hope you children will all use your minds and study how to reduce this frictional resistance to zero. Then, people riding bicycles will be able to drive freely without any effort at all.</p>
<p>Plants in the Ocean</p>
<p>Dong Xun</p>
<p>The ocean, like the land, has many plants and animals living in it. They also need food and nutrients. They also have "survival of the fittest" competition, but the methods needed are different from those of land creatures!</p>
<p>Speaking only of fish among marine animals, there are already more than 20,000 species. The quantity of other kinds can be imagined. There are also many kinds of marine plants, but only a few kinds with larger bodies are noticed by the world: green algae, red algae, brown algae, flowering plants, and filamentous algae. If we want to see the rest, we have to rely on the power of a microscope.</p>
<p>Here are eight kinds of marine plants, all algae, that we can see.</p>
<p>(1) Giant Kelp Kelp is commonly known as "seaweed." There are about 29 families (over one hundred species) in the world. Giant kelp is the largest plant in the Vibro genus. Its leaves are widest and thickest in the middle, and narrower and thinner at the top and bottom. The stalks are very short. The total length is usually within ten feet, and the longest is about twenty-four or five feet. Kelp can be eaten by us, and it tastes very good. In addition, history can be made and alginic acid can be extracted.</p>
<p>(2) Gracilaria Gracilaria is also called hair algae. Its body is slender and cylindrical. Many slender branches often grow in clusters from a thin root. Side branches and small branches occur everywhere in each plant, and each part is the same shape and size. The upper part of Gracilaria has many hemispherical cystocarps. If there are many cystocarps, it looks like an irregular string of prayer beads. Although Gracilaria is edible, its texture is tough and not a delicacy. They often intertwine with each other and form a group, so what we eat mostly looks like a mess of hair.</p>
<p>(3) Grateloupia Filicina Grateloupia filicina can be used medicinally to treat worms in children's abdomens. Its quality roots are tough. When fresh, its body is blackish purple, and it becomes dark brown after drying. After being exposed to the sun, it becomes yellowish brown. The total length reaches seven or eight inches.</p>
<p>(4) Enteromorpha Enteromorpha is slender and thread-like, with fine hairs on the surface, so it looks white in water. The plant grows to about one and a half feet long. It is hollow like a tube, with tight constrictions every one or two inches, but these parts do not grow as large as the other parts. The young plants of this species can also be eaten after being exposed to the sun and dried.</p>
<p>(5) Codium Fragile The plant body is dark green and flattened, long and lanceolate. There is mostly only one body, sometimes with multiple branches, about two or three feet long. Also edible.</p>
<p>(6) Nemalion vermiculare The body of Nemalion vermiculare is cylindrical, five or six inches long, either single or branched into several clustered strands, with a very soft texture. Its taste is very delicious, for eating. Its surface is sticky and slippery, with a dark purple color, and the top is slightly green. When it becomes fully mature, its upper part turns from yellowish brown to milky white.</p>
<p>(7) Gelidium amansii Gelidium amansii grows abundantly in clear seas. It is usually red, but there are also reddish-purple varieties. The body shape is mostly flat and linear, and the roots are filamentous, branching and growing on rocks. The plant tissue has large cells, and the gaps are filled with agar-like substances, making it the best raw material for making agar. In addition to being used as food, agar can also be used in printing, papermaking, cloth making, and medicine.</p>
<p>(8) Ulva pertusa Ulva pertusa has very small roots, and flat leaves grow directly from the roots, without stems. The color is bright green, very beautiful. The part near the root is slightly darker, and the upper end of the leaf has a milky white edge. This can also be used as food.</p>
<p>Of the above eight species, (1) and (4) belong to brown algae, (2), (3), (6), and (7) belong to red algae, and (5) and (8) belong to green algae.</p>
<p>Children! Do you know how much seaweed Japan imports into our country every year? I'll tell you: 400,000 dan (a unit of weight), worth 5 million yuan!</p>
<p>Our China is not without territorial waters or aquatic organisms! Children! Hurry and work hard! Hurry and work hard! They are waiting for you to develop them!</p>
<p>Why Does Closing Our Eyes Seem to Make Us See Red?</p>
<p>Baisha</p>
<p>We all have an experience: in the daytime, when we close our eyes facing the light, we see red; in the dark, even if we close our eyes, if someone turns on a light, we can always feel that there is light, and it is red; what is the reason for this? It is indeed a wonderful and interesting question.</p>
<p>Actually, it is very simple. When we close our eyes, we see red, just like birds are startled by light when they close their eyes. This is because eyelids are somewhat transparent, so they cannot prevent all light from penetrating the eyes. Also, there is red blood in the eyelids, so the light that passes through the eyes and eyelids passes through the red blood that is always in the eyelids. This red blood retains the other colors in the light and only allows red light to pass through. Therefore, when we close our eyes in the light, we see red.</p>
<p>Begonia</p>
<p>Ziqiang</p>
<p>Begonia, begonia,</p>
<p>How beautiful your leaves are!</p>
<p>How fragrant your flowers are!</p>
<p>The territory of our Republic of China,</p>
<p>Resembles the shape of your leaves;</p>
<p>Our people love peace,</p>
<p>Like the fragrance of your flowers;</p>
<p>But those hateful little caterpillars,</p>
<p>Want to gnaw the edges of your leaves,</p>
<p>Eating the thorns that grow roses,</p>
<p>Give them a wound!</p>
<p>So that those clownish troublemakers,</p>
<p>Won't disturb your borders day and night.</p>
<p>Then, the completeness of your leaves,</p>
<p>Will surely win the praise of all nations in the world.</p>

<p>When the Panama Canal was being excavated—that is, a canal in Central America that connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans—it was initially started by the French. But for some reason, the workers often contracted malaria, and it was very contagious. Every year, tens of thousands of workers died. The work became very difficult, and it was really hard to continue! So, they had to let the Americans continue. The Americans studied the spread of malaria and found that it was entirely due to the transmission of a kind of "malarial mosquito." So, they worked hard to eliminate mosquitoes, paid attention to hygiene, and enabled the workers to safely complete this huge project. The greatest contribution can be attributed to eliminating mosquitoes!</p>
<p>In ancient China, there was a scholar who studied very hard all day long. But at night, many mosquitoes would bite him all over, and almost his entire body was bitten! He really hated it! So, he came up with a solution: he moved two earthenware jars and placed them under the table, putting his feet inside. As a result, the mosquitoes were much quieter! Ah, children! Have you ever seen Mr. Wang's hilarious movie? It was just about the same.</p>
<p>The King and the Shepherd Boy (8)</p>
<p>Xin</p>
<p>Little King Huale clamored: "Heavy? I see that you can lift this heavy thing, so it's nothing for me. Put that staff in here, I want to hold it for a moment."</p>
<p>"In that case, hand me the crown too, and we'll exchange them."</p>
<p>Little King Huale said happily: "Very good, I'll go get it." Saying that, he tiptoed up the stairs. He stealthily stepped over the sleeping guard, and the fierce dog smelled its master's scent, so it didn't make a sound. Little King Huale took his jade crown and hurried back to the window filled with moonlight.</p>
<p>"The crown is here," he said, handing the crown out through the window lattice, adding, "Try it on for a moment, and quickly give me your staff."</p>
<p>The two of them shouted in unison: "This thing isn't heavy at all! I don't feel anything holding it!"</p>
<p>They talked for a few minutes, comparing the lives they led. Little King Huale complained that he was confined and couldn't be free, constantly surrounded by many people. Shepherd Boy Huale, on the other hand, complained that he always lived outdoors, lonely and desolate.</p>
<p>Little King Huale said: "My mother says that I am a public servant of many people. Ah! My masters are too many! I'd rather be like you, the master of the sheep."</p>
<p>Shepherd Boy Huale replied: "I am not the master of those sheep, but actually their slave, my father once told me. Moreover, they really belong to you. Because they all have a small crown printed on their backs."</p>
<p>The little king said quickly: "Is that so? That's really fun. The most interesting thing is that my scepter looks like a shepherd's staff."</p>
<p>As they talked, Shepherd Boy Huale gradually felt the crown digging into his forehead. He felt that the crown was getting heavier and heavier, his forehead was hurting, and his head was drooping. At the same time, Little King Huale, holding the shepherd's staff, initially felt it was very light, but now it gradually became heavier. He thought it must be made of lead. Immediately, he took a breath and switched it to his left hand. At that moment, Shepherd Boy Huale suddenly groaned and took the crown off his head.</p>
<p>He then said: "Hey! This thing is very heavy! How can you wear it all day?" Saying that, he quickly stuffed the crown back through the window lattice.</p>
<p>Little King Huale also poked the shepherd's staff out of the window lattice, saying: "Hey! This thing is very heavy, I don't know how you hold it in your hand all day."</p>
<p>"This is really fun!" they both said in unison, laughing loudly at the same time. The little king felt very proud, thinking that he could wear such a heavy thing on his head, and the shepherd boy also felt very proud, thinking that his right arm was getting stronger and stronger every day from carrying the staff.</p>
<p>He then said: "The sky is already dawning. I have to go back to watch my sheep."</p>
<p>The little king shouted: "Come again next time, come again and talk to me."</p>
<p>From then on, Shepherd Boy Huale would come to the outside of the palace wall once a year, and have a sincere long talk with Little King Huale through the window lattice. The little king often told the shepherd boy how bored he was in the palace. The shepherd boy also often told the little king how cold it was outside. Therefore, whenever the little king was dissatisfied, he would always remember the shepherd boy crying and wanting to enter the palace, and when the shepherd boy complained about his hard life, he would also always remember the little king crying and wanting to go outside.</p>
<p>These two children grew up. They both, like ordinary people, harbored worries and also had much happiness, because one was a good king and the other was a good shepherd. Both of them became famous far and wide. The blond Huale was called "the shepherd of his people," and the black-haired Huale became the royal shepherd, therefore called "the king among shepherds."

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Amateur Weekly Philosophy Lecture From "Qi Tian Clan's Grand Gathering of Guests" to Teleology and Mechanism</p>
<p>Jihua</p>
<p>There used to be such a story: "The Qi Tian clan held a grand gathering of guests in the courtyard. One person sent fish and geese. Tian said, 'Heaven is truly kind to people! It produces grains, fish, and birds for people to eat.' At the time, all the guests echoed him. Only the son of the Bao clan did not agree. He said, 'All things are born with us, without any being noble or lowly. Who is born for whom, who should eat whom? This is all a matter of the strong preying on the weak. It is not a rule set by Heaven for us. Otherwise, how would you explain mosquitoes sucking human blood and tigers and leopards eating human flesh? Does Heaven also give birth to humans for mosquitoes and tigers and leopards?'" Such a story seems very stale, ordinary, and seemingly has no value for study now. The error of the Qi Tian clan's remarks and the correctness of Bao's son's arguments also seem to be no problem. But who knows that this little problem is still being debated in the current and thousands of years of philosophical history, and even now, some people often commit the mistakes made by the Qi Tian clan under the elegant, profound philosophical appearance and the hidden philosophical terminology?</p>
<p>Even now, some people still insist that mice are born because cats want to eat them, and laborers are born to be employed by capitalists. For example, teleologists in philosophy can ultimately reach such a conclusion. They believe that the movement and progress of the universe are all according to a certain purpose. Everything is planned, has ideals, and has a purpose. Teleology is further divided into two schools: one believes that all things in the universe, as well as the universe itself, proceed according to their own purposes and plans, without the participation of external forces. This is called inherent teleology. The other believes that outside the universe and all things in the universe, there is a creator who dominates the universe, directing and regulating the progress of the universe, and proceeding towards a certain goal according to the will of this creator. This is called external teleology. For example, Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato were all teleologists, with Plato being an external teleologist and Aristotle being an inherent teleologist.</p>
<p>In philosophy, there is also another school whose views are completely opposite to the above-mentioned teleology. They believe that the development and changes of the universe all have their inevitable laws. The universe is like a machine, and its movement is like the movement of a machine, with no randomness or freedom. There is absolutely no so-called purpose, let alone a creator. There is only cause and effect, and no plans or ideals. For example, the ancient Thales, Democritus, and Epicurus, and the modern Spinoza all belong to this school. Many scientists and philosophers today also belong to this school, such as Bacon, Wundt, Feuerbach, etc. This school is generally called mechanism.</p>
<p>So, who is right and who is wrong?</p>
<p>If we only examine the phenomenon of facts, we can say that they are all right and all wrong. If we simply deny the claims of teleologists and say that everything in the world has no purpose, then there will be many examples that we cannot explain. For example, if we want to build a house, can we build it successfully if we don't have plans, designs, etc.? If we don't have the ideal of transforming society, how can we achieve a perfect society in the future? Obviously, human behavior is purposeful and conscious, and is by no means completely blind, regardless of whether the purpose can be achieved. Therefore, it is not necessarily correct to simply deny teleologists. As for mechanism, yes, everything in the universe has its causal laws, and there is absolutely no god to dominate it. But are humans also acting completely according to these mechanical laws, without any freedom? Is there no purposefulness in human behavior, or has there never been a bit of purposefulness? Therefore, absolutely agreeing with mechanism will also fall into the fallacy of being unable to explain objective facts.</p>
<p>To go further, if we deny the inevitable laws of the objective world and only proceed according to the plans and purposes we have in mind, we will still fall into a state of stagnation. Because if we do not understand the objective situation and only pay attention to the subjective, then no matter how many and how perfect plans you make, the result will be "building a car behind closed doors, and it doesn't fit when you go out." This is the harm that inherent teleologists will reach. If we think that everything is dictated and instigated by a master outside the existing world, then our own efforts will be useless. Won't the result be the same as "obeying orders" and the "fatalism" and "determinism" reached by absolute mechanists? Conversely, if we completely agree with mechanists, then we will inevitably become "waitingists." Anyway, the objective world and objective facts have their own laws of motion, which cannot be prevented or promoted. That is to say, humans are also completely subject to the net of these inevitable causal laws, and even if we work hard, it will not have the slightest effect or change. Then we might as well just let nature take its course without adding human power. Doesn't that also regard the laws of nature as a plan that has been predetermined by Heaven in the dark? May I ask, how much difference is there from that external teleology?</p>
<p>Therefore, simply opposing one or absolutely agreeing with one is wrong.</p>
<p>Originally, the objective world has its own inevitable laws of causality, but this does not mean that it does not allow the existence of purpose. Of course, to find purposefulness in the natural world, such as saying that the sun shines directly on the northern hemisphere in the summer for the purpose of humans harvesting rice, or that inchworms consciously turn muddy gray to avoid being pecked by blackbirds and become tree branches, that is bound to be absurd. But as a result of the evolution of the material world, human society has emerged from nature. Although no purpose consciousness can be found in nature, human society has purposefulness. In the natural world, even for animals, their actions are simple instincts, and they reflect after being stimulated. Therefore, they can only adapt to the environment and cannot transform the environment. They can only passively change their own organs to suit the surrounding environment in order to continue their survival, and cannot actively use their brains to think of plans and methods to change the objective environment in order to suit their own survival. Therefore, animals are still completely subject to the iron mechanical laws of the natural world and cannot be said to have purposefulness. If we say that the Mimosa pudica, the sundew, animals with protective coloration, the claws of tigers, and the long feet of fast-running beasts all have purposefulness, then why can't we say that the sun, moon, stars, and the weather, sunny, cloudy, cold, and warm all have purposefulness? It must be known that these are all the result of using human consciousness to compare with nature. Because humans have purpose consciousness, every time they do something, every time they say something, if they examine the origin, they are not doing so aimlessly. Therefore, they humanize the natural world and add purposefulness to it. This is completely the view of idealists.</p>
<p>Humans are a product of the countless years of evolution of the universe. They have a highly organized substance—the brain—and also the advanced attribute of this substance—consciousness. They not only instinctively reflect after being stimulated, but they can also achieve thinking through sensation. This is where humans differ from animals. Simply having instinct and sensation can only passively absorb the reflection of the objective world and cannot organize this reflection. But with thinking, they can not only passively absorb the reflection, but also organize the reflection. From this constant reflection and constant struggle with the natural world, they gradually discover the laws of development of the objective world and change the objective world according to these laws. That is to say, humans are no longer something that grows naturally, but something with purpose consciousness. Therefore, in the natural world, only mechanical inevitable laws dominate, while in human society, there is purposefulness.</p>
<p>However, saying that humans have purpose does not mean that humans can have free purpose and are completely free from the control of objective causal laws. On the contrary, if purpose is to become a reality, if purpose is to be achieved, then it is necessary to fully and deeply understand objective causal laws. To put it thoroughly, humans are also products of nature, and also part of nature. They must consciously understand the laws of nature in order to utilize nature, conquer nature, and transform nature. That is to say, objective causal laws must be transformed to the subjective in order for the subjective purpose consciousness to have a counter-effect on the objective world. Therefore, purpose consciousness is not completely opposed to objective laws. In many years of practice, humans gradually recognize nature, and the laws of nature gradually change from "things in themselves" to humans' "own things" and are grasped by humans. At the same time, the purpose of humans is also gradually achieved, and the possibility of achieving it increases day by day. This is a contradictory development. If it is just fantasy, then wanting freedom will instead lead to unfreedom.</p>
<p>As for humans in society, it is even more so. In the practice of social life, humans are dominated by the laws of social evolution, and therefore constantly reflect these objective social laws in their brains. After a long period of time, accumulating much experience, they subjectively unearth the causal laws of human society, and then use these laws to promote the development of society or transform it. Therefore, all social reformers in history are also great idealists, and their purposes are greater than those of ordinary people.</p>
<p>In short, focusing on reality and the objective world, we must find causal laws from real things, find causal laws, and then set the purpose of our actions. We should not act blindly, establish purpose subjectively, nor should we mechanically obey objective laws without any effort. In this way, we can move "from the kingdom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom," and from "explaining the world" to "changing the world."</p>
<p>Outlying Postal Agencies Election in Rural Areas</p>
<p>Ping</p>
<p>Correspondence from a County in Jiangsu</p>
<p>One evening, we were having dinner when an unexpected guest came to the door, holding a large stack of cards in his hand. He took out a card and handed it to my brother. I was very curious and looked closely at the card. It turned out that it was an invitation from 〇〇〇, ▲▲▲, ×××, and □□□, who were participating in the election this time, to a banquet for the township heads of the district at someone's house in the countryside tomorrow afternoon. According to the servant, they would also be sending out invitations that night!</p>
<p>The next day, it was said that the township heads of the district had already been persuaded by the second faction and did not attend their grand meeting. At noon, unfortunately, the several tables of wine and dishes they had prepared in advance were not eaten by anyone. Only one township head and one village head came as guests. They came with excitement and left in disappointment. However, in the evening, the entire team returned to the city to host a banquet for the township heads of the urban area. It is said that the results here were very good.</p>
<p>On August 15th, the county-wide civil servants took an oath, and all the township heads of the county came to the city. At noon, after the oath-taking was completed, everyone went to the public sports field, where people from each faction waited to host banquets. At first, they used "Please, please, please come to our side!" It didn't work, so they followed them. Finally, they raised their arms and pulled them away. Someone laughed and said, "Where did these country bumpkins get such a great appetite?" It is said that this banquet was particularly extravagant.</p>
<p>From mid-July, the known (public) election banquets totaled as follows (according to local newspapers): On July 25th, Principal × of × school hosted a banquet in Shanghai to entertain the local gentry. On August 12th, Lawyer □ of □ hosted a banquet for the gentry at the Cotton Industry Association of this city. On August 13th, □□□ hosted another banquet at Wu's Restaurant. On August 14th, □□□ and his party went to Waigang to invite township heads to a banquet. On August 15th, at the oath-taking ceremony for civil servants, the ▲▲▲ faction and the 口口口 faction each sent people to the venue to pull guests to their banquets. On August 16th, ××× hosted a banquet for the township heads at Nanyuan in Nanxiang. On August 19th, ▲▲▲, ×××, and four others, accompanied by a former provincial councilor, hosted a banquet at the Yinzai Residence in Loutang to entertain the township heads of the Fifth District. Only two people attended. That evening, they returned to the city to host a banquet for the township heads of the First District. On August 20th, ××× hosted a banquet for the township heads in Huangdu. On August 21st, ×××, ▲▲▲, and four others hosted a banquet for the local gentry at a certain school. The chef was specially hired from Shanghai, and the dishes were exquisite, costing 30 yuan per table, for a total of five tables. On August 23rd, ××× hosted a banquet for the township heads in Nanxiang. That evening, a special car was dispatched to Shanghai, booking dozens of rooms at the Datong Hotel. Those who liked Peking opera watched Peking opera, those who liked movies watched movies, and there were also dancing girls to entertain them. On August 30th, ××× dispatched a special car again to earnestly invite the township heads to Shanghai for a banquet, still booking Datong Hotel rooms, and a special car sent them back the next day.</p>
<p>The election activities are becoming increasingly heated, and the voices of mutual attacks are also becoming increasingly loud. 〇〇〇 said to someone, "My subordinate □□□, he took 2,000 yuan from me to campaign for me, but who knew that after taking the money, he campaigned for himself. I am irreconcilable with him!" Later, someone said: 〇〇〇 and □□□ were originally cousins, but when the election became heated, they didn't even recognize each other as cousins!</p>
<p>××× entrusted a local gentry to write a letter to a certain district head, instructing him to help ×××. After receiving the letter, the district head hesitated for a long time, and then replied directly in the letter, saying, "My nephew □□□ also intends to campaign for the National Assembly representative, and it is impossible to have both, I am very sorry!" The people who wrote these two letters are all respected scholars in the county. If these letters can be made public to fellow enthusiasts, they will surely not be unworthy of being good historical materials in the election anecdotes.</p>
<p>There is a certain village head who is a teacher at a local substitute elementary school, with a monthly salary of only nine yuan. Usually, no one mentions or helps him. This time, □□□ promised the village head the position of secretary in the office, and the village head immediately packed his bags and set off for Shanghai. Who knew that on the way, the luggage and the person were taken away by ▲▲▲'s people, who also promised him a position. Someone said: The clay Bodhisattva in the dilapidated temple, although no one comes to burn incense at ordinary times, but once the Buddha's luck is high, it will be as red as a red Buddha!</p>
<p>Open bribery, everyone knows that things are too dangerous. Smart candidates said in letters to the township heads of a certain district, "Please indicate how much is needed for travel expenses." This can be said to be unfounded and extremely clever. Also, a certain candidate allowed the daughter of a certain township head, Ms. 某, to study at the school run by a certain candidate for free. This can also be described as perfect!</p>
<p>Among many candidates, ××× is the most extravagant in terms of banquet luxury and generous spending. Other candidates cannot reach him. ××× once made a bold statement: "Prepare to spend 50,000 yuan for campaign expenses!" According to people close to the candidates, ▲▲▲ has also spent more than 1,000 yuan, but seeing that ×××'s momentum is very strong and still rising, with his money being far and wide, it is difficult to compete with him, so he has been very annoyed recently.</p>
<p>After watching this series of good shows, outsiders feel very suspicious. Since the National Assembly representative has no way to make a fortune, isn't it just that they will once again use the people of the countryside as meat or engage in private embezzlement as a source of compensation? If the election of National Assembly representatives is to</p>

<p>— Du</p>
<p>Negotiations regarding the Chengdu incident have not yet begun. However, news of the death of Nakamura Junzo, a Japanese resident in Beihai, has emerged. Amidst voices of improving Sino-Japanese relations, such unexpected twists and turns occur again and again. Not only is this regrettable to the local authorities, but also to those of us who seek peace, causing us to clench our fists and sigh. Indeed, although relations between the two countries are yet to be adjusted, there are no deep rifts between the people of both sides. Why would petty grudges escalate into acts of violence? Now that the conflict has already arisen, resentment is futile. It is only hoped that those in charge of both countries will use reasonable means to seek a swift resolution, and not allow the negotiations to be delayed, causing the situation to become even more entangled.</p>
<p>The truth about Nakamura’s death is still unclear from the daily telegrams. However, it is reported that he had resided in Beihai for more than twenty years. He must have been able to communicate with local people on a daily basis. Even if his influence has had an effect, he is no different from the natives. Unless he had just arrived and attracted attention. Moreover, the cause of the disaster is said to be a dispute over words with a customer, which led to a physical altercation and injury, and the injury led to death. Instinctively, it is an ordinary murder case resulting from a fight. What kind of meaning can be found in it? However, the occurrence of this incident came after the Chengdu tragedy, and Beihai was once garrisoned by the 19th Route Army which had resisted Japan. This is the reason for the serious impact caused. It is something that ordinary people could not have anticipated. Today, warships have been ordered to rush to the scene, intending to conduct an investigation. However, there is still deep concern as to whether the local garrison can avoid misunderstandings. The beginning stemmed from unintentional actions. Where will the evolution lead? Mr. Diao Zuqian did his best to dissuade Japanese warships from sailing there, precisely out of this concern. If the Japanese side really has no intention of expanding the situation, it should focus on the difficulties that exist in reality and take very cautious steps.</p>
<p>Since the Chengdu incident occurred, the Japanese side has experienced a surge of emotions and expressed excessive indignation. At that time, we advocated calmly considering the matter. Even stable newspapers in Tokyo deeply felt that excessive stimulation was not a good plan. It is because today, when Sino-Japanese relations are being gradually adjusted, even if there is an occasional unfortunate incident, it is crucial to seek its elimination in an invisible manner with a spirit of mutual understanding. How can one be provoked and create one's own troubles? Furthermore, both sides’ circles of public opinion should employ calm minds and uphold fair and impartial views, so that emotions can be regulated, and negotiations will naturally proceed smoothly. This is our minimum understanding. It is hoped that our wise colleagues on the Japanese side will also be able to deeply reflect on this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is something else we want to say. Whenever an incident occurs between China and Japan, the Japanese side often believes it is a resurgence of the anti-Japanese movement. In fact, the Chinese people's love of peace has long been recognized by the world. The National Government has a clear order to promote friendly relations with neighboring countries, and the people have no expression of radical words. There are calls for economic cooperation, and both sides are increasingly seeking practical approaches. Even the preservation of some unpleasant emotions can easily be eliminated with goodwill and diplomacy. However, the gunboat policy seen in the past is the greatest obstacle to friendly relations between the two sides. Now, at the beginning of negotiations on both cases, if the Japanese side can truly see through this point and seize the opportunity to make an attempt to build friendly relations with gentle means, the cloudy atmosphere between China and Japan will surely undergo a significant transformation. Whoever tied the knot must untie it. It is up to the Japanese side to plan for themselves.</p>
