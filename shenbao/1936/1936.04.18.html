<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國外交的動態</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>目前的英國外交已陷於矛盾和苦悶的深淵了從這矛盾和苦悶中去找出路就是今日英國外交家所焦慮的問題就英德關係來說希特勒所標榜的廢的目標是在抑制蘇聯反對法蘇互助協定這在英國未始小願表示幾分同情但是在另一方面英國站在協的國的地位站在占有世界殖民地的大部份的地位是决不願意輕輕把旣成的局勢旣成的事實破壞或是改變的英內閣對於這個問題曾起了激烈的爭辯保守黨舊派鮑爾溫等主張對德妥協以貫澈它反蘇聯的外交政策可是這就難免破壞或是改變旣成的局勢和旣成的事實而影響到它在殖民地的利益了保守黨新派艾登等主張對德制裁以維持旣成的局勢和旣成的事實可是這種辦法不獨是爲人作嫁使法國能够回復大陸的覇權而且更足使德國和意國沆癱一氣而引起北海和地中海的同時吿警再就英意關係來說意大利從瑪加爾一戰獲勝之後節節進展且已佔領台西最近阿軍北路藩籬盡撤中樞動搖而英國在地中海的覇權和蘇丹棉區的水源也感受了很大威脅法國不但不給英國帮忙反而對羅馬暗送秋波於四月十日的國聯十三國委員會中不惜替侵略國家張目力主取消對意制裁在這種情勢之下英國如欲保持它在地中海的覇權和蘇丹棉區的水源自不得不主張加緊對意制裁以促意國侵阿戰爭的早日結束可是墨索里尼現方挾法國以自重氣熖高張英國倘要對意加緊制裁安知它不會以「加緊制裁就是戰爭」做口實來威脅英國呢</p>
<p>在今日英國當局的心目中要從這種矛盾和苦悶中求出路只有兩個方法第一是和法國妥協縱不對德制裁也給法一臂之助以减少德國對法的威脅同時以阿國爲犧牲縱容意國在尊重地中海和東菲的英國旣得權益的條件之下繼續進攻阿國第二是抱着和意大利周旋于地中海的决心加緊對意制裁先和意大利反目繼和法國仳離甚至和德國勾結照目前的情形看來英國是採取前一個策略的醞釀已久的英法比三國參謀部談話十五日在倫敦舉行十六日匆匆結束據哈瓦斯社所傳英國已應允法比于兩國遇到不宣而戰的侵略時予以軍事上的援助至于對意態度也很顯明自國聯十三國委員會十六日開會以來侵阿意軍大舉轟炸阿國陣地施放毒氣英國旣不指責意軍的施放毒氣爲違反一九二四年的日內瓦議定書又不提出加緊制裁的建議所表示的無非希望意國修改對阿媾和條件罷了</p>
<p>雖然這種方策未必眞是英國矛盾和苦悶的出路阿比西尼亞做了侵略者的酬勞品地中海的爭覇戰勢必要變本加厲萊茵河的風雲卽使可以和緩於一時但法國覇權的樹立也非英國所肯坐視的所以英國的外交終究脫不了矛盾和苦悶</p>

<h3>新疆婦女　對貞操極注重</h3>
<p>麥斯武德著文作眞實介紹京訊、自報載新疆通訊對新疆女子貞操問題、加以錯誤之記載後、各地回民、均異常憤慨、北平兩報、且被搗毀、引起糾紛、旅京新疆籍之中委麥斯武德、頃特著文對新疆女子貞操問題、作眞實之介紹、題為「一個母親最神聖的責任」、茲錄原文如次、</p>
<p>母親保護女兒貞操</p>
<p>在新疆做母</p>
<p>親的最神聖</p>
<p>而且認為最重要的責任、就是保護她們女兒的貞操、這貞操的證據、就是在處女膜上、為了這個責任、可憐的母親們、不知用了多少方法來完成呢、對她那如心肝一樣的女兒、年齡達到十二歲時、是絕不許她做任何艱劇的事、連跳躍這樣細微的事、也都注意到了、為提高父母家庭或民族的身分光榮廉恥、完全是託付在她們女兒的身上、她們信仰着而且努力的去做、有些話雖是使人害臊的、但我不能不來說一下、就是在舉行婚禮的那一天、一切人們、都是非常快樂、惟有那可憐的母親、却表顯出憂愁顏色、她憂愁的是怕她的女兒生出意外、而不是個處女因此給她家庭和民族一個極大的羞恥、一直要等到把她女兒的貞操給她丈夫證明、兩方的家長相信滿意以後、這可憐的母親、才能在託老天之福當中、開始微笑了、她才能有權在家庭中用着笑顏來自誇自讚、整個的家庭、整個的民族、也都對她尊敬起來、如果不是這樣的話、那未、這　新組織的家庭的爐灶、將要熄滅了、不但她的丈夫、不能要她、就是她的父親、也要把她的母親趕走、因為她不能保護她女兒的貞操、兩方家庭、從此將變成仇敵、諸位凡是到過新疆或去過新疆考察的先生們、你們在新疆或許未留意到像這樣細微的貞操問題、現在我來請你們知道一下吧、</p>
<p>女人不讓別人看的</p>
<p>我們暫不管</p>
<p>這根本是不</p>
<p>是一個宗敎問題、新疆最守舊的回族學者們阿訇們、他們是主張男女要分開的、女人除了她自己的丈夫以外、是不讓別入看的、要用面慕罩起她們的面孔、他們這種主張、自稱是盡宗敎上責任的、今日阿訇們與維新派所爭論最烈、甚至常常流血的事件中、最重要的、也就是這件事了、你們曾經看見一個回敎的阿訇在街道上遇見了罩有面幕的女人、而不掉頭走開去的嗎、他們以為看女人是有罪的、我想這是任人皆知的、你們如果沒有看見的話、那就不能算是到過新疆的人、有了這樣的事實、那可憐的母親、怎麽能够把她年才十一二歲女兒初夜權、來給阿訇們享受呢、同時具有這樣精神的阿訇們、怎敢來做這樣犯法的事呢、像你們這樣淆亂黑白、信口雌黃的說謊者、你們這種欺騙、要我們來使你承認嗎、還是你自己承認呢、為了賺錢而造謠的人們、罪已到了你們的頭上、你們的謊話、是不是自己負責呢、</p>
<p>伊斯蘭教人戒嫖賭</p>
<p>我們很久以來、就注意了伊斯蘭敎戒律中嫖娼問題、「戒律」（黑浪母）是什麼呢、是說對主所禁止的事、無論何時、皆不能違背的、例如不食猪肉、不飮酒、不嫖娼等等、無論是誰、祇要他是一個回敎徒或回敎的兒童、他們都很能明白遵守的、回敎的阿訇們、也是時時向人民敎導的、他們對這尊嚴戒律、是要自己遵守以後、才來敎導別人的、自從這些事傳佈到社會民間以後、一般的人們、也就很自動的歡迎着去做了、這也是伊斯蘭敎能深入土耳其民族最重要原因中的一個、土耳其民族對回敎法律上、最注重保護貞操、這件事在土耳其民族的認識上精神上、是非常適合的、今日有那個民族把他的女子或成年的姑娘、為了不使外人觀看起見、而把她關閉在房子中呢、到外邊的時候、把她面部遮罩起來呢、出來的時候、把她關在四面帷簾嚴密的車中呢、為什麽使外國人來駡我們守舊和不解放呢、她們為什麽受人家的罵呢、這都是為保護她們自己的貞操、而所找的辦法啊、你們到過新疆去的人、沒有看見這個情形嗎、如果看見了、沒有研究其中的原因嗎、這是不是一個研究民族問題的人研究一個社會風俗習慣的人、把這種研究、拿來給漢人看的事呢、你還想社會來相信你這樣沒有邏輯的、沒有理智的、為了出風頭而亂呌嗎、你還以為中國的社會、仍是那樣的幼稚嗎不罷、（中央社）</p>

<h3>糖商受華北走私影響　國糖陷入絕境</h3>
<p>全市十六家糖行均入停頓狀態　存貨由積營業寥寥有停尊重之虞　糖商憶電財部及各省請救濟</p>
<p>大化社云、吾國年來對於糖業一項、頗見起色、向來國人所用食糖、以洋糖較多、近年以來、粵省遍植糖蔗、產量大增、故國糖銷路已駕於洋糖之上、其銷售之總經理處、即在上海、凡國糖洋糖、經上海轉運至華中華北各省、故上海洋糖之銷售、幾遍全國、舉凡江蘇·浙江·安徽·江西·山東·河北·湖北·河南·湖南·山西·陝西·等省、咸向上海購買、是以上海一地、實爲糖業運銷之要地、而每年營業數量、亦至爲钜大、年銷五百萬担、每担以二十二元、時價計算、可達一萬萬元之數</p>
<p>私糖倾销　華糖絕跡</p>
<p>自去年起、華北海關屢屢走私後、吾國糖業、已大受影響、及至本年一二三數月、更因浪人大量偷運、尤以食糖一項爲最钜、於是國產糖業、益遭打擊、蓋愉稅食糖、每担因成本低廉、售價甚輕、只有十五六元、而國糖售價、則須二十二元左右、因之私糖得以暢銷、初僅平津一帶、旋蔓延至陝西·山西·河北·等省、嗣竟深入於安徽·河南·湖南·等省、最近即江浙兩省、亦有此項私糖、充斥各地，國糖遂益無人問津、</p>
<p>內地各省　受害一斑</p>
<p>據本市糖業公會薛梅亭謂、現下內地各省、盡係私糖、蓋此種食糖其成本價格、頗爲平衡、無甚上下、每担至多僅相差二三角、吾人如照章納稅、則其成本須合至二十餘元、萬難跌價與十五六元之私糖競爭、因之華商糖業受累不堪、目下各省商家、以洋糖爲有利、茶至有營洋布業者、今亦改營糖業、可見私糖侵略之一般、而普通糖商、雖欲購進正式來源之食糖、但恐爲低價食糖所爭奪、不得已亦祇得改購私糖、因是之故、各省遂不再營國糖矣、</p>
<p>所受損害　已達千萬</p>
<p>據目下情形而言、在全市六十二家糖行、已入停頓狀態、銷路亳無、營業清淡、無不在水深火熱之中、岌岌可危、上月份及前月份之糖業、全市僅達萬餘包、僅二十萬元左右、吾人如依一年營業達一萬萬之此例言、則此數日雖爲淡日、然其營業之不景氣、亦可想見矣、目下在金利源碼頭、公和祥碼頭等處堆積華糖、均無法出清、</p>
<p>電呈當局　呼　救濟</p>
<p>全市華商、以爲長此以往、則停業之虞、可立而待、用是於日前電請財部速商有效辦法、但亦難以着手、糖業公會、昨正在擬電陝西省政府財政廳、請對私糖徵以特種消費重稅、使其售價與不走私者相若、俾資救濟正式糖商、然結果如何、殊難逆料、亟盼當局速籌根本補救之法云、</p>

<p>各縣在五小學區至十小學區內、指派一聯保主任爲該學區學董、聯保主任因地位興職權關係、對於實施義務敎育暫行辦法大綱施行細則第二十九條所規定之任務、原比較易於做到、但聯保主任之資望·學識·責任心、及其所居住之地點等條件、在指派之前必須慎重察度、然後纔易收效、不致等於虛設、必要時、可依同條附欵之規定、令酌置指導或助理人員、指導或襄助學董、辦理事務、至學董原爲無給義務職、應從精神上設法鼓勵之、免其因物質上酬報之缺乏、而怠荒義敎基本之工作、</p>
<p>各縣短小學生人數我屬稀少、一校僅設一班殊欠經濟、與中央推行義敎原旨　有未合、嗣後除令各短小校長、切實依照短期小學校長須知中「招生留生辦法」實行外、應即將所已公布之強迫入學辦法、嚴厲執行、期收實效、</p>
<p>各縣主持義務敎育行政人員、應訂定考成辦法、詳加考核、嚴予懲獎、</p>
<p>宣城短期小學獎勵會辦法、蕪湖特設短小敎員代課辦法、對於義敎推行、大有裨助、各縣在可能範圍內、應參酌仿行、</p>
<p>該省短小師資、頗形缺乏、應速依照二十五年充短小師資統籌計劃、辦理短小師資訓練班、並實行藝友制、爲學生就訓容易、與師資分布普遍計、除阜陽·黃麗·徽州·三處外、應另行指定敎員者、待遇似應略高、藉以安定其生活、</p>
<p>各縣短小是有兼任他職分心外務者、有出名承辦而私請他人庖代者、有不加招生而將校牌懸掛私塾、略予塾師以若干之津貼者、此種情形、應查明撤辦、以儆效尤、</p>
<p>各縣短小學生及其家長、對於半日二部制、多不滿意、在校舍設備足資支配這學校、應多辦問時二部制、或混合二部制、其學生不多者、可用普通的復式編制、直接敎學與間接敎學、更迭支配、學生即可全日在校、但複式敎學法必須特別研究、方能運用自如、</p>
<p>爲適應短小學生各種不同程度起見、學習能力較強者、及畢業後仍請求讀學者、可酌授補充敎材、凡小學及民眾學校新舊讀物、或坊間所流行之應用文字、均可酌量採用、不必拘限、此種材料來源、可由學生家長設法購買、或向人募贈、注音符號、如敎師缺乏敎授能力、似可暫不敎授、以免浪費時間、</p>
<p>各縣短小開辦設備、及辦公等費、由聯保主任籌指、困難滋多、弊端　出、亟應設法改進、休寗擬由縣府設法統籌、蕪湖擬用統收統支辦法、均值得參考、</p>
<p>各縣短小敎員薪水、除近處由其親自具領外、偏僻或　遠地方、可由縣敎育局派遣可差、按月送至各校或其他指定之處所、掣取收據、在公家所費有限、在短短小敎員則節省許多時間與用資、所惠實大、　（未完）</p>

<p>紗市續挫，形勢軟化、蓋以四月期交割接近、多方雖大量吸收、均集中遠期、對於本月份仍無收貨之意、且陣綫仍被人套利、所以近月鬆懈、遠月受其牽制矣、</p>
<p>金難再跌一元許　標紗前市開盤、各月一致下墮、但跌風未熾、仍屬和緩之勢、以大部份多頭未有舉動，祇有一部分加碼、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五·六角、午後開盤市氣仍平席、三盤時略回、迨至收槃又轉疲途、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二·三·四角、查賣出大孚八百五十包、大豐七百包、錦昌七百包、同豐一千包、仁豐七百五十包、長豐五百五十包，同和九百包、慎記七百五十包、大　七百包、買進裕康二千一百五十包、裕大一千一百五十包、澄記六百包、合興八百包、益　一千四百包、經華七百五十包、生源五百包、永大五百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉產一時不易擴張</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份又見一致　固、洋麥報價、芝加哥跌三角另、坎拿大跌一·角另、市場人心、初尚平靜、旋以本月份爲籌碼有限、廠方－時不能擴大生產、因此人心，步步向上、遠期則因新麥登場、尚有二月、廠方既少出檔、業中籌碼、亦少放出、故人心亦爲帶高、較前日計好一二分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份交易雖不甚暢、人心則又趨堅、遠期初盤續好近分、後則多頭回出、稍覺軟弱、後步如無特殊情影、暫看盤旋云</p>

<p>國產潮糖、昨據汕頭確訊、以青　改製粗砂之說、既不可能、亦不含算、决無是事、惟汕　仍須看升、有到一千二百元之形勢、本來匯價長、情市可廉、但汕市存　不豐、如匯水長、　積價亦必隨升、暫無看　希望、故申市漸呈緊勢、號貨開出不多、昨僅成交合　青五十三包、十元〇四角、餘乏續開、惟雜路白反有下游之象、</p>

<h3>海味　陳魚膠存底不厚</h3>
<p>魚膠新貨則將登塲、但　檔陳貨、街上仔額亦已無多，所以市情、極其堅穩、惟長嘐　項、近被洋莊停辦，去化滯呆、若賴國內天津青島漢口等帮生意、僅屬有限、市故比前略疲、　底　不厚價盤尚能維持、咋日行盤兜售長膠高貨一百元、次至九十元、無根貨一百十元、寗波紮面膠一百五十元至一百四十元、搭肚原干一百三十五元、一普通一百三十元、外山提片肚一百六十五元至一百六十元、溫州貨　檔一百六十元、次　一百四十元、吊片肚一百二三十元、米魚膠厚莊一百四十八元，統手一百二十元、</p>

<h3>鞏固我們的自决權</h3>
<p>— 陸顧文淑</p>
<p>近十幾年以來，在新思想和舊思想交戰的聲浪裏，我們中國婦女界對於自身和社會家庭關係的目光很明顯地可分下列三種。</p>
<p>主張服務社會比治理家庭爲重要理由是根據十八世紀一般新思想家，像服爾德Voltaire盧梭Jean　Jacques　Rousseau骨鳩女士　Olympe　Se　Gouges　等的學說，以爲女子也是人，人和人應該站在一條水平綫上，所以女子也要同男子一樣投身社會，替社會服務，認定女子的基本功能並不是僅僅養育兒女，綿延種族而已。</p>
<p>主張家庭重於社會　這稱主張和上一派主張恰巧絕對相反，理由是說女子因爲生理或是學識上的關係，適宜好好地留在家中，管理家政，敎養兒女，好像聖經上說：「好女子手裏持了紡綞幹最吃苦的事」意思是說盡婦女的天職，做一們賢妻良母的模範，不必一天到晚拋頭露面地在外面跑，並且男治外，女治內，是可以十足表現出人類合作的精神，除了這些，女子假使永遠伏在家裏，還可以減少社會上，失業的人數，不是很有利於社會嗎？</p>
<p>主張服務社會和治理家庭並重理由是攏括上而兩種的理由，以爲假使我們婦女能把職業和家庭看得並重，不分彼此；那麼自身的地位可以永久不低落，並且同時又不忘記自己的本能既不辜負了社會，又不把家庭忽略在一邊，當一個完美的女人？</p>
<p>細細考察上面三種主張，最後一種似乎最合理，最妥善，但是事實上却不容易辦到，因爲一身要兼顧兩面，又不能如蘇俄德國的母親們在外面做工時，家事孩子都可以有人代爲照料，所以結果這主張僅是好說好聽而不十分好行吧了</p>
<p>至於第一種和第二種呢？表面上看去好像相差很遠，不過研究它們的重心郤仍舊是一樣，第一種的重心是在服務社會，我說第二種的重心也是服務社會，爲什磨呢？因爲留在家裏敎養成良好的兒童，就是造就他們將來成功一個純潔高尚的公民，這種工作難道不是間接地在服務社會嗎？</p>
<p>所以我以爲這幾種主張都是對的，我們只要觀察我們自己的環境，情形，身體，性情，學識而定，我們替社會服務的方式，問接或直接，不要拘泥在某一成見上，硬定這樣行是對的，那樣做是錯的，做一個沒有一點自主權的女人，總之最重要的一句話，就是要知道這種取捨揀選我們和社會家庭關係途徑的權，是屬於我門自己的，我們要永久保護這神聖的自决權，不讓任何人，任何勢力，加以指揮，干涉，或是節制。</p>
<h3>獨身的樂趣</h3>
<p>— 夢蘇</p>
<p>貪愛自由…放棄責任</p>
<p>我有一個朋友，她是一惆年已三十六歲而風　未减於風信年華的獨身女子。她的家庭是一個中產之家。她的父母都是在地方上有相當名望的。她自己曾經受過高等的敎育。在過去若干年中，也曾在情塲中受過許多男子追逐，但她始終不曾陷入情網。近年來，她竟把各方的求婚一概謝絕，而毅然表示著以獨身終老。她現在是一個有高尚職業的女子。我爲了她的固執成見，曾經和她往復辯論，冀其回心轉意，早相佳婿，做一個新時代的賢妻良母。無奈她的辯才無碍，竟把我的勸告一口駁回。綜合她所持的見解，有下面這許多妙語：</p>
<p>『自由是人間最可愛的真理。人爲自由而生，爲自由而死。婦女中真能享受自由幸福的，只有不婚的女子。</p>
<p>『我願在我有生期間，完全享受着自由，不願以任何代價賣去我先天得來的自由。……</p>
<p>『我自營生活，自由選擇我的職業；自由交結我的朋友，不像已嫁女子要被丈夫的好惡所牽制。我可以不因丈夫所愛的人物而作違心的酬酢。我於世界一切，可以從心所欲。我愛靜的時侯，可以　然獨處，而沒有兒女的牽擾。倘使我要兒女作伴，儘可以向孤兒院裏喪選擇一個來摸著她。</p>
<p>『因爲我是個未婚的女子，而又姿色不在中人以下，差不多每個男子見了我都表示顯意親近。我只許她們做我精神上的朋友。這也未始不足以自豪。</p>
<p>『與我同樣年齡的姊妹們，此刻都已做了太太或一羣小朋友的母親。她們每回遇到我，總要談到我的身世前途。甚而至於代我抱着無限的憂慮，彷彿把我看作一隻大海的孤舟，不知要飄流到那個去處；又似乎把我看作一隻迷途的羔羊，早晚要給野性的豺虎所吞噬。我呢，對於她們這些好意的過慮，漠然無所容心。我不能了解結婚的幸福在那裏，我自視是一個寥廓的飛鴻，東南西北，任我翱翔；上下四方，隨我來去。我又何妨長此狐芳自賞！……』</p>
<p>我對於這一位孤芳自賞的現代「北宮嬰兒子」，一面表示無限的欽敬，一面表示甚大的遺憾。自由誠哉是可貴的。但婚姻又何嘗會剝奪女子整個的自由呢。世上果然不免有許多鸞鳳失諧的怨耦，但也儘有不少琴瑟葉調的佳耦。若是爲了顧慮失足於怨耦之林而長抱獨身，是何以異於因噎廢食？有情眷屬的天倫樂趣，又豈是苦守著獨身的人所能夢想！即舍苦樂的計較於不論，人身的男女，是先夫判定的，連帶便有共同應負的責任。</p>
<p>古代的北宮嬰兒子撤其環瑱，至老不嫁，以養父母。做父母的又豈願以自己的娛老，而使女兒以孤寡終身呢？所以這種孝情，早已成爲過去；何况僅僅爲了個人的自由，而把對於民族應負的責任輕輕卸脫，又何異於戰士的臨戰脫逃！法律雖不禁人獨身，道德律上也是講不過去的。</p>
<h3>醜婦和犯罪</h3>
<p>— 慧芳</p>
<p>在社會生活的地位上，美人和醜婦各自具有不同的態度。薄命的美人，對於幸福的醜婦，常以爲是不自然的狀態，而懷不滿之念。至於遭過不良的醜婦，以爲此種遭遇，全爲自己的醜陋所造成，遂生鬱鬱不快的感覺</p>
<p>凡醜陋的婦人，多爲「性的弱者」故常擬用面貌以外的長處，以補足醜陋之缺點；如遊藝，技能，修飾，財富等等，在諸多塲合，均可達此目的。且醜婦大多不像美人一樣高傲，所謂「醜婦情深」，亦即此理。惟醜婦對於「性的劣者」的自覺，决不能因以上之諸補足而消失，這在伊們日常生括上的影響是根深的。因此之故，便與犯罪發生相當的關係</p>
<p>根據處置肥罪事件的人所說：與人通姦者以醜婦之數爲多，這雖然不能　爲十足可信的事產，但亦有其適當的理由。醜婦因爲缺少男性的注意和交接，故不易得男性之熱情，如美人之多。一旦如有男性以真誠相待，按諸常情，伊極易發生很大的愉快，感到性的滿足。此即驅使醜婦走近氾罪的重大原因。常與異性缺乏交際而隔膜疏遠的婦人，在意外地獲得此咱機緣時，决不有輕易放過，使伊們失於檢點和顧慮，而致犧牲伊們的節操。又有一說，以爲美人雖亦有不少與人姦非之事，惟美人之姦非，與醜婦之姦非，兩相比較，極有差異。因爲爲美人夫者，雖發見他的妻子有姦非之行爲，然因恐失却這美人，而故意隱藏其事者，有之。反之，如與人私者爲一醜婦，則其夫平日對之，已較疏遠，此時當少寬恕之念，因此把伊的醜行告發。根據數字，醜婦與入通姦奢較多，或爲一積表而的現象。此脫似亦有其見地。</p>
<p>再者，因爲醜婦不易獲得異性的愛好，故當伊占有異性時，必極力逢迎，委曲求全，以其所有的熱愛和好意，傾注於伊的對手。一旦如爲對手所棄，或對手爲人所奪時，必致發生嫉　，忿怒，怨恨等劇烈的感情。較之美人對待異性之冷淡，大不相同。被棄之婦人，因欲報復這「性的失敗」的仇恨，遂能發生縱火殺人等犯罪的行爲。細察日常報端披露之此種事項，實屬醜婦爲多。這種仇恨，亦有以與人姦非來發洩的。也有因爲被夫遺棄絕，遂致甘自暴棄，造成種稱犯罪。或則窘於生活之難，而與人通姦以求倚賴，或獲得金錢，作娼妓之行爲者。（本文根攘市島謙吉「婚人與犯罪」）</p>
<h3>法國婦女生活的實際現况</h3>
<p>— 秋雯</p>
<p>我們談到了巴黎的繁華，就會聯想到那裏婦女的浪漫，奢侈，荒靡。這都足以象徵伊們並不是一個高等民族的國家。然而，實際到過法國全域的人。就會知道法國婦女一樣是要努力於伊應負的生產工作，决沒有一個肯把整天的時間浪費於享樂中。雖然伊們除了工作以外，把娛樂和裝飾看作第二生命，但我們知道任何國家的人民，除了工作以外是應當給以相當時間的休息和娛樂。</p>
<p>法國婦女大概因爲沒有參政權的緣故，所以在國家機關服務的很少。差不多全是向商業上去謀發展。不論那一個城市鄉鎮的商塲和店鋪裏，用女職員的就佔到十分之六。至於娛樂場所（包括電影院，跳舞塲，咖啡館，）那就完全由婦女包辦了。伊們爲了交易的關係，不免和異性的主顧有接觸的機會。而造成了伊們浪慢的引綫。何况在伊們國家中一個女子結過七八次婚，並不算一回事。社會對於伊也並不加以一些輕蔑和歧視。</p>
<p>至於田問鄉村的婦女那就此城市的更加敦樸勤勞了，田間的婦女在春秋兩季，每天在天沒亮透（那裏約合我國上午四點鐘）的時候，闔家就都耍要身，忽忙中吃過早餐，－家人就得扶鋤隨犁的到田問去工作，直到夕陽西下才回家休息。至於在工廠中作工的婦女，伊們也是每天八小時工作，早晨六時起開工，中午十時歇工，下午十二時開工，四時歇工。那裏不像我國的採用夜工制度，因爲伊們國家婦女協會裏有着「夜間是我們婦女大衆的」，規約。雖然，有許事婦女爲了生活問題而情願增加夜工，但一經國家查到，那這工廠就要受到國家的處罰</p>
<p>其他值得一說的就是法國已婚女子，都應當負起一種極大的責任。凡是子女已到學齡時期，做母親的就得把他們送到學校去受相當的敎育，非經若干年，國家予以考試及格後，作母親的才能卸去完全的責任。因此有子女的婦女尚在社會服務的就佔到極少數，否則也都託付給一個專事管理學生敎育的代辦所，（那裏並沒有專門名詞，不過這種塲所很普遍，有些像蘇聯的保姆所。）然而爲母者，一樣要時時負起督促和糾正的敎育職務。</p>
<p>伊們最普遍的娛樂塲所却是每一個市鎮鄉村都設立的咖啡館，因爲城市的跳舞場都需要着偉大的建築和宏麗的設備。而在鄉村田問的人們，就不需要這些，因爲那裏的咖啡館，並不像我國的祇是吃食鋪，同樣地也可以跳舞作樂。每天晚上七點鐘時候在開店，接着就有男男女女的陸續跑到這裏來，不過在十點鐘也就停止了。他們的娛樂程序，也僅僅是喝一杯咖啡，和跳幾次舞，决沒有越軌的舉動。</p>
<p>從上面法國婦女生活的簡單報告中，我們就知道伊們同樣是一個前進的民族。和蘇聯婦女一樣地要爲國家努力於生產工作。决不像我國婦女們整天速晚的從事於享樂生活中。</p>
<h3>發肝氣</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>中國婦女，十個裏面倒有九惆患着肝氣病的。據說肝氣發作時，胸膈上下，有塊氣塊儘向上推，患者便宛轉呻吟，非常難過。從前西子捧心，大概就是那肝氣發作的綠故罷。治肝氣無特效藥。有許多患者告訢我，只消一抽大烟，胸前氣塊自會消失；不知這是飲酖止渴，葬送了許多人！</p>
<p>舊式婦女，或因夫妻不睦，或因姑媳芥蒂，或因受了其他氣憤，往往會成肝氣病的。有位趙太太，少時羨慕虛榮，年華蹉跎，後來嫁上了一個有錢的癮君子，方以爲可以稱心適意了。那知伊的丈夫，又娶上了一個妾，從此，夫妻之問，詬誶時聞，伊便患上了肝氣病。好得抽烟便當，不入，伊便與大烟結成不解之緣；并且每遇着同病的相知，還要稱贊那大烟的神效，把它敬給別人抽，美且名曰「香一口」。</p>
<p>韓太太是伊的芳鄰。那位太太，腹大如五石瓢，據說也患肝氣病的。伊得病的原因，由於婆婆的一句話。一次，伊患難產，旁人都急得什麼似的，獨有伊的婆婆冷笑道：「人家都能快生快養，只有你…」韓太太聽了一氣，就氣出這們肝氣病。一天，兩位太太相遇，彼此初談些家常瑣事，接著伊們就談起肝氣病的問題來了，趙太太又要勸韓太太「香一口」。韓太太因恐要受伊的丈夫責罵，終於未敢上口；然而同病相憐，韓太太恐難保不步趙太太的後塵呢！</p>
<p>中國婦女，向來是工愁善病的：工愁不外受著氣鬱：善病，又十之九大概都患著肝氣病。偏是大烟，又能消胸中的氣塊；所以我特舉上列的事實，勸勸家有太太們的，勿要再上它的當。</p>
<h3>青海的婦女</h3>
<p>— 與琳</p>
<p>青海在中國的西部。那個地方的人民搭帳棚爲屋，帳房中設一寵，把帳房隔爲二，左部歸男，右部歸女，彼等認爲夫婦同宿一處爲可恥之事。</p>
<p>青海地方的男女是沒有軒輊之分的。凡是到過青海的人，一定能常常見到有許多青年男女持槍躍馬在山野之地獵取野獸。</p>
<p>青海地方的婦女每天早晨趕牲畜入山吃草，正午的時侯擠牛羊乳。下午，則在家裏任挑水，捻毛綫，洗衣服，製酸乳，膠乳，乳渣，乳餅，乳合，乳粉，乳飯等事。婦女們除了做以上的幾伴事外，其他如縫紉衣服及放槍捕盜等事，都　於男子們去擔任。</p>
<p>婦女們的衣服都用綢緞做成的，外套都用獸皮製成的。穿的衣服袖僅及腕下，腰圍很緊。穿的裙很長，周圍很緊，因爲伊們是終年不穿褲子的。伊們終年不洗操，就是洗而亦僅用茶碗盛水蘸抹而已。伊們的頭髮結成百辮，辮上綴一布，寬約五寸餘，直至腳跟，其上掛以銀飾及瑪瑙石等類。貧窮者亦有掛銅石的，重約數斤，耳環大如我人之鐲，更有加以兩串姍瑚，懸及肩上，以爲美觀的。</p>

<h3>邵元冲夫人　張默君女士論婦女問題</h3>
<p>— 寄萍</p>
<p>張默君女士，爲中國婦女參政領袖之一，記者亦久仰其人。此番漫游首都，承朱君毅博士之介紹，得與會見，賓深快慰！女士儀態萬方，而出言做事，有恭直之氣，不愧爲巾幗丈夫。凡所論列，應爲婦女界奉爲圭臬，茲紀談話如后：</p>
<p>夫人求學時代有何值得回憶之事？</p>
<p>「當予求學之時，足資回憶之事有三：（一）予　齡時，於甲辰丙午間肆業於上海務本女子中學，維時已加入同盟會，從事革命運動；當時清廷搜捕甚嚴，故予行動極端守秘。一日，校長吳懷疚先生召予至辦公室聞曰：「爾爲何加入同盟會而從事革命工作乎？」予知其已檢閱予往來信件而發覺，因對曰：「滿洲以異族而入主中夏，施行專制淫威，壓迫我民族，桎梏我民智；使我民族不能發展，國勢日漸衰弱，凡我漢族，均應起而加入同盟會，一致團結，推翻異族政府也。」吳曰：「此事危險殊甚！萬一將來發覺，慎再株連學校也。」予正色曰：「大丈夫任事，敢作敢當，予一人作事，當以一身當之，決不累及他人也。」吳聞而莞爾曰：「勇猛哉孺子！」（二）一日有一女子至校訪予，適予外出，及歸，校役告予曰：「頃有一衣和服女子來訪，不言姓名，留字而去。」予觀其留條曰：「予以要事歸國，不日返漸，願先與君接洽，刻未遇，不有久待，　悵！」下署一「　」字，予見此字，方知其爲吾志友秋瑾女士也。當時因不知其住址，未能回訪，殊爲悵惘。未幾，即開伊就義浙中，予甚悔當時未能與伊偕往，同爲民族流血，爲之不快者累月。（三）某次務本女校舉行全校運動會，中有　旗　走」一項，敎師命予於萬頭攢動中，以數尺見方　布四幅作書，予即揮「我武建揭」四攀　大字，爲北魏體，與予今時書法不同，當時各報製版就載，此亦趁一時之興，以示提倡我民族尚武精神，回念童心，有餘味焉。</p>
<p>請追述過去所創之社會事業</p>
<p>「予過　所參加之社會事業，可得　　　有四：　辛亥秋予　　君伯純公光復蘇州後，主辦　　報於滄浪亭可園，以　　民主政　：　民國元年與數女同　發起「婦女協贊會」於　　，　募北伐軍餉數萬元，　回　數人親　南京臨時大總統孫公：　發起神州女界協進社，及創辦神州女學，神州女報，從事於敎育學術救國運動十餘年：　與熊朱其　夫人等發起江蘇平民敎育促進會於南京，爲中國平民敎育之　　。」</p>
<h3>張默君女士</h3>
<p>請夫人指示中國婦女自覺之路</p>
<p>「茲事實至重大，決非片言所能盡，總括言之：中國婦女應以中國固有之道德以鍛練身心，注重人格感化；從敎育學術方面以改進中國社會，挽救國家危亡！」</p>
<p>請批評中國婦女之弱點</p>
<p>「予以爲現代女子中知識份子較　增進，　　　，俱共缺點：　無聯絡與合作精神，　缺少組織能力，　對於責任心較薄，而猜忌心較多。」</p>
<p>對於「賢妻良母」與「賢父良夫」之意見</p>
<p>「此問題聚訟甚久，爲一般新婦女所不喜聽。以予觀之，所謂賢妻良母，認爲古今中外社會中不可缺少之主張，何則。欲求國家之強盛，必先求家庭之健全，女子爲家庭之中心，右一家之中無賢母良妻之主持，則其家庭之　敗可知。然一家之幸福，　乎男女雙方之合作，賢母良妻之　象即爲父良夫，此間題需雙方並重，　　　不可，夫賢母良　最大之力量爲真誠，由真誠而生母愛，予以爲世界上最偉大最純潔最永久之愛。　　於母之愛。倘人能將　母愛　而　之，以保赤子之　而待全民族，則世界可躋於大同。予　賢母之主張爲廣義者，非惟　表被天下，」猶需亦子萬族，是皆在人好　爲之耳。</p>
<p>夫人治家之主張如何？</p>
<p>予治家主張以道德及人格感化爲基礎，再以科學藝術精神以造成衛生美　之家庭，以合於先　所　「日新共德」「日新久日新」之訓，並以促進「新生活之社會。」</p>

<h3>骨痛戒烟法（一）</h3>
<p>— 賈治中</p>
<p>戒烟苦事矣。以患病戒烟者允苦。而以骨痛戒烟者更苦。蓋烟癮發作。則精神萎靡。渾身失去自然。身罹骨痛老。則骨節痠痛。筋絡抽攣。合之烟癮之苦。不啻雙重桎梏也。</p>
<p>如去秋有骨痛患者裴宇淸。迭求戒姻。苦難忍受。半途而止。後經余囑向中法藥房購服「强斯登氏骨痛片」治其骨痛。骨痛旣瘳。全身舒暢。另投服「生殖素」除毒斷癮。卽告安全戒烟。精神愉快。回復壯健云。</p>
<h3>胃痛戒烟法（二）</h3>
<p>— 喬文彬</p>
<p>吸烟由來。以緩和病痛者爲最多。胃痛吸烟。又占其十九。夫鴉片非能治病去痛。特以其含有麻痺毒質。能掩飾於一時耳。迨夫中毒成癮。則病痛轉劇。非迭加共量。不復能麻痺掩飾矣。</p>
<p>去冬有王稚周君。來求戒烟。據訴昔以胃痛難治。而致吸烟成癮。經余囑向太和藥房購服「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」治其胃痛。而用「生殖素」培補除癮。始告痛除癮斷云。</p>
<h3>遺精戒烟法（三）</h3>
<p>— 王士英</p>
<p>遺精夢洩。概由生殖腺虧損。精關鬆弛而起。然在戒烟時期。亦往往訴有本症者。治法以固精爲尚。培補其生殖腺輔之。庶根治之法也。</p>
<p>戒者周國棟。上月來診。訴有遺精之苦。以致戒烟難竣全功。經余囑向五洲藥房購「希米脫氏固精片」治愈其遺精。而主用「生殖素」除毒斷癮。因「生殖素」爲培補戒烟良劑。故戒時生殖腺繁榮。絕不重現遺精云。</p>
<h3>調經療帶婦科福音</h3>
<p>（高景西夫婦來函云）吾倆今連署來函伸謝。謝貴刋重賜家庭幸福之恩也。吾妻任氏。體本柔弱。九年前因產後失調。致罹月經不調及白帶纏綿等症。身更虧損。體益瘦瘠。精神委頓。心力疲怠。生機消失。幸福寡絕。迭求治療。咸無影響。前月投函本刋。承示可內服（女用生殖素）外用（療帶靈）治療。卽向附近中法藥房指購。依法內外兼施。現已經調帶掙。身壯體健。重獲當年新婚時代之健美。若此二藥者。洵婦科之福音也云。</p>
<h3>腎痿早洩名藥救治</h3>
<p>（樊秀倫君來函云）余遠處滇南。身罹性病。腎痿早洩。痛苦不堪。欲求治療。醫藥不便。去秋因閱本刋。亟投函詢求治法。承示最妥來滬就醫電療。吾則可服「生殖素」自療。當以相隔萬山。無從分身。卽向上海永安公司西藥部函購名藥「生殖素」半打。依法內服。半打未完。早洩先瘳。腎痿亦治。（中略）生機重萌。不啻再造云。</p>

<h3>神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 兪伯符</p>
<p>患者熊兆年。去秋來訴有腰痠背疼體顫肢冷等症。余診得熊君並罹有骨節痠楚。卽囑向中西藥房購「生殖素」及「强斯登氏骨痛片」並服之。卽覺腰背有力。全身輕健。骨節舒暢。四肢靈活。欣欣稱謝而去云。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>救濟失學與减輕學費</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>在我國這種貴族敎育制度之下，靑年要受敎育，實是一件極困難的事。現在各級學校，其收費之鉅，往往爲一般人所不能負担。因之社會上除富裕家庭子弟，有機會進學校讀書﹔普通家庭子弟，都有無力求學之苦。允以近年來國民經濟，日趨衰敗，靑年之失學者，更是有增無减。這情形是如何的嚴重，不但是靑年個人的不幸；同時亦爲社會國家的損失！</p>
<p>最近敎育部爲救濟靑年之失學計，向行政院提案，令飭全國各公私立學校，自本年度起，設置免費及公費學額如次：　免費學額，甲·小學本以不收學費爲原則，現應嚴加考察，督促該原則的實施，卽仍有收費者，亦當督令逐年多設免費學額；乙·中等及專科以上學校，至少應設置學生全數百分之五以上的免費學額；　公費學額，定爲全校學生數百分之二至百分之四。這辦法是極善的，雖其救濟範圍，亦屬有限﹔但至少一部分貧寒子弟，可多得一求學機會。我們希望小學不收學費原則，能早日實施；俾義務敎育，得以普及推行。中等及專科以上的學校免費及公費學額，亦能逐年增設；使無力求學者，不至被接在學校門外。</p>
<p>惟我們覺得要救濟靑年之失學，設置免費及公費學額，固然重要；而責令各級學校，削减一切收費，亦是急要之舉。因前者只能獎進少數品學俱優，無力求學的學生；後者才可以减輕多數學生家庭的負担。我國學校，學費膳宿書籍等費之外，又有服裝講義體育諸費：眞是名目繁多，難以枚舉。其他如報名入學賠償等額外的榨取，不勝負担。故我們希望敎育當局，對於這一點，應加以注意，設法以改善之。對於各級學校的收費，除規定一最高度學費；凡不正當的費用，須盡令廢棄。如是方可以使一班靑年，有多得求學的機會。這亦是救濟失學所不能忽視的問題也。</p>
<h3>暴風雨</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>——海航的故事——</p>
<p>天是陰霾得象快要塌了下來。珠江河面不時刮來了怪裏怪氣的風，吹得人家心裏儘在戰抖。灣泊在河面對過白鵝潭海面的幾隻洋艦都升了火，胖而壯的烟通是冒着黑陣陣的烟霧，很象在正等待着什麼似的。——這個陰陽怪氣的天氣，只要走過內河的人也知道不是神色，可是不知怎樣，我門這條貨船，又要從廣州再次溯着西江開出了。大家都不開心，有點不願意似的有神沒氣地工作着。</p>
<p>「刁你老祖個臭口…赶？赶到肇慶去送終嗎？」</p>
<p>五叔邊在解纜，邊是呢呢喃喃地詛咒着。三老爹這天也烏雲蓋臉地一點不起勁。只是循例地關照着，象喇叭筒那麼的覆述着剛才二老板吩咐的話。——</p>
<p>「這次開到肇慶卸了貨便沒事了。不過要赶快，今天初七了，我們要赶十一到肇慶，轉來時一點也不累，——大家便提一點兒勁吧」！</p>
<p>他自己便是天字第一號提不起勁，長烟桿斜靠在他的膝頭上，他也懶得去劃一根火柴去燒着那已裝好了一袋老農夫牌生切烟，連眼皮也疲得挺不起了，很象有什麽事累了七八天般的人不象人，鬼不象鬼。老七不要說了，剛才上岸城隍廟的張鐵筆說他流年不吉提防小人，他便一直担心担到現在，趁老桂鬆了一口氣，很低聲地問：</p>
<p>「這一趟敢保平安嗎？你看——扯了十字風波哩！」</p>
<p>他指着那個警告着有颶風到省的有點怕人的風波，老桂沒睬他，三老爹却緊縐了眉頭，也不作聲。</p>
<p>前頭小火輪傳來一般謠言了：今天不好開船！</p>
<p>「從香港刮來的風尾哩，這一趟不好走，一走誰担保不發生事？」</p>
<p>「不是嗎？崛尾龍造反可不是玩的，聽說又要它在天上番幾個跟頭世界便都變了樣哩！」</p>
<p>「不走不成咧！一切都預備好了，你們不敢胆怕死，我們便打電話去要別人家了。」</p>
<p>隔壁一條貨船也是赶貨上梧州的，他們此我們還急。我們這時心里都打定主意：走不走都沒關係的了，反正吃人家的飯，赶得到赶不到都沒我們的份。有點相反地，我們正要他不赶，弄一塲大風大雨的，我們可以躱在省城里過幾天快活日子。………</p>
<p>嗚………</p>
<p>悠長的凄厲的小火輪底汽笛聲衝破了我們的希望了。它已在慢慢地開駛着，拖着了我們一共三條赶貨不耍命的離開了碼頭。這時候白鵝潭已變成了一個二個小山堆，風掀着波浪在湧呀湧的，風里又夾着一層黃沙霧，把河面弄得烏烟瘴氣，眞不好走。小火輪是拼着了性命，那帶點勉强而且悲哀的汽笛聲象一枝送葬的死人笛，大家聽到了心里都不禁起着抽搐。</p>
<p>老七呆瞧着我，眉心打着皺紋，鼻孔在駭得瘦削了，口唇象給什麽人揑了一把似的發白得怪難看，額角鼻尖儘在冒汗。他兩眼發直，有點象在無可奈何地說：聽天由命吧！風來刮了他一個耳光，浪花噴了滿臉，頭髮給水沾着了，臉皮在起着鷄皮皺。我這時候也和一個痴子一般，心胸里空空洞洞什麽也不想，什麼也都想去想想。老桂五叔兩人很賣力，抖起了十二分精神，因爲只有他倆最有經騐，三老爹太不成，老得象一個鷄巴中屁用。</p>
<p>風越刮越大了。有幾點不知是浪花還是雨的洒到我們身上發着慄。天黑得眞不象樣了，很象眞不換一個不成。這時候的勢色已十分不對，隔壁便有人聲嘶力竭地在喊：</p>
<p>「躱一躱吧！躱一躱吧！祖宗十八代的耍命哇，到附近白蜆殼去躱一躱啊！喂，我們斬纜啊！……」</p>
<p>船駛出了白鵝潭，海面便是一望空際，有點不好過，船身已搖得有點象孩子搖籃一般了。貨船已有一隻脫了纜自己衝着向後退了。我們不知怎樣，完全沒了主意，平素很鎭靜的三老爹這時候也沒有了主張。</p>
<p>「啊哎——哇！……」</p>
<p>跟看幾聲什亂的慘呌，前面的小火輪碰着了什麼了，人在不斷地呼救。跟着駁纜便很厲害地牽動了我們。船一側便裝進了半艙水，雨點已越落越濃，象若干枝箭射到身上來發痛。但也管不到了，拿了戽斗我和老七慌忙把水裝着向外倒。但不知怎的我們還沒有把穩了船身，旁邊斜刺里却衝來了一條掛着白地紅日的旗幟的兵艦，哇啦哇啦地鼓着了浪，使我們的貨船再把持不定。——</p>
<p>「　——救……」</p>
<p>凄厲得怕人的聲音沒有呌完整句，五叔已在傾着的右邊番身落了水了。老</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>桂鎭定地夾了一塊厚艙板跳下了水，奮猛地游近了五叔落水的地方去，但浪湧得很大，我心急地。瞧瞧老桂還沒扒到那里，五叔頭用力地掙了兩掙便沒了踪影了。我身旁三老爹正深長地嘆了一口氣，我們站的地方也顯着不穩，船已完全傾覆。</p>
<p>在怒吼着的海上，我抱着了一個木箱，在風和雨的突擊之下度過了一個漫漫的長夜。</p>
<h3>春宵曲</h3>
<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>幾時是花開的時候，我記得的。</p>
<p>然而，這於我，現在已經是過去了的流水啊。</p>
<p>小雨後的舖道，顯得有點泥濘了。</p>
<p>我們沿着護城河邊走着。</p>
<p>河水漲得滿滿地，載着些殘敗的蔬菜瓣兒和靑草緩緩地流了去。</p>
<p>河底彼岸，古舊的山城在夜底微茫里邊劃出粗線條的輪廓，是那麼地靜靜的。有如一個老年人懷了輕視年靑人的心緒，而同時又感到自己快要沒落的悲哀，於是，就沒奈　地躺在那兒，默默地望着天空。——黝黯的天啊，沒有月，幾顆星子畏縮地露出蒼白色的苦笑。……</p>
<p>由於慣常的夜行，我是熟悉了我底影子的。往時，看着除了自己底之外，還有一個苗條的頎長的伴着，就感覺什麼都是柔和的，溫情的了。</p>
<p>影子是永遠地沉默的。我們也就沉默地過了一大些時日。</p>
<p>現在，沒有了！兩個兒全是單調的笨拙的呢。</p>
<p>『太冷寞了啊。』我嘆息着。</p>
<p>眼珠子朝前望去，遠遠的幾乎是湮濛了的地方，有霧一樣瀰漫着的樹林，樹林後邊，高高地張起幔幕也似的山影，山土，還矗立着一襲瘦削的高塔。可惜是夜了，不然，我一定要跑到那里，瞧瞧是不是到處兒都盛開着花朵。眞的小春底三月已經來了麼？怎麼今兒底風還帶着悄寒嗄！</p>
<p>『年靑人不該如此的。』敏君，我底同行的伙伴，我底說敎者，又來將我們底辨論開始了。——每次，每次，我們底爭辨，總是以他底自以爲勝利的得意的嘻笑，和我底無邊的憤恨爲結論的。——他接下去說了。『失掉了一個女人家底愛，並不是怎麼了不起的天大事。怎的就憂怨到這個地步呢！別人家，失去了家的，失去了國的，不都是要哭死了麼？』</p>
<p>可憎恨的說敎者底臉孔在我底面前搖晃着，搖晃着。我底胸腔里霎時間又塞滿憤怒，懊恨，煩惱。這對於事實上落空的理論，於我有什麼用！我眞想不理他。然而，爲了生氣，我於是快速地回道：</p>
<p>『這是我自己底事情呀！』</p>
<p>『是的，我知道這個。……那末，你想怎樣？』</p>
<p>『我想怎樣，我能做些什麼！只是在忍受着苦痛吧了。』</p>
<p>『「忍受」是頂壞的東西！』他輕蔑地說。</p>
<p>『不盡然的。在某一種條件之下，有一個最低的限度，儘可能地忍受着。——我相信這是合理的。』</p>
<p>『啊，蠢傢伙，你是全然的錯誤哪！因爲——這正是「弱者底屈服的衆徵」啊。不，不，你應該——』</p>
<p>他幾乎是呌出來了。</p>
<p>『可是，你想吧，死了的火山，也有復活的一天的。何况……』——我雖覺得我有加上這一句話的權利；而同時，也知道這是無補於事實的。</p>
<p>『不，你應該立刻挺起你底胸脯纔是呀！』</p>
<p>『是的，會有這樣的一天的啊。』</p>
<p>我笑着。回過腦袋來瞧他，他也在笑。</p>
<p>於是，我們也就沉默了。……</p>
<p>在走完這挺直的舖道，而折向更其湫隘，更其泥濘的小巷底時候，我俯在他底耳邊說：</p>
<p>『死了的火山也有復活的一天的！瞧着吧，朋友。』</p>
<p>幾時是花開的時候，我記得的。</p>
<p>幾時是花落的時候，我也記得的。</p>
<p>然而，這於我，眞的是成爲過去了的流水麼？</p>
<p>不啊，到了明天，還是有陽光的呢</p>
<h3>武聖廟前</h3>
<p>— 芷夫</p>
<p>早上，大堆人包圍了武聖廟，把山門口擠得水洩不通。人們都伸長着勃子視綫，一齊集中在那張嶄新底黑字加紅圈的佈吿上。</p>
<p>「哦！修造萬緣橋！……」識字的人在喊，</p>
<p>于是，擠進去的從新回出來，這女概不會引動大衆的同意！人們的面部，先前是喜悅，這一來，似乎加上一層不愉快，在那不愉快的表情中，反　着有千萬牢騷將在每個人心房裏摒出來。</p>
<p>「年歲這般荒，造屁的橋，不是明明想掏……」周大頭怕聲浪太高，說到這裏留了嘴，回頭相相，好在沒給主腦兒聰見，他歇了歇，才把一個「錢」字來補足，完成了句話，伸伸口舌，扮個鬼臉，自顧縮在籮棚下。</p>
<p>……「修橋，不算眞的做好事！有錢麼，施米…施粥……算他們陰功積德！」錢癩子講好那話，握緊左手，望空打了一拳，希望大衆誇獎他，賞他一個采。</p>
<p>「老子一輩子不走那頂橋，管他娘的賬！「接着周大頭又狠狠地：說完，拉轉身子向東跑。</p>
<p>「操啦！不是上次建造什麼大明寺，小瘤子大爺發了一票財……」爬在石獅子上的洪阿九，今天又喝飽黃湯講醉話：</p>
<p>「好！扔了他媽的……」錢癩子再接再厲，準備捏着理由尅倒他，</p>
<p>接着，人們被激動了，大都跟癩子的話表同情。</p>
<p>咒駡和囂吵夾成一片，洪阿九帶着些酒意，開首闖入人叢中把那張紙扯下來扔在脚底下。</p>
<p>「啊！釀了亂子啦！武聖廟前，開始混亂着，有抱了頭顱在奔的，活像狗子給油湯澆着了身。</p>
<p>漸漸……這個兇消息有人奔吿了瘤大爺，他睜着臉，連一件馬褂扣子都沒扭，隨手帶了三個黑漢子，趕到廟前，他面部的肉，橫着，簡直疑心是一頭獵犬，卽刻會把那些小動物悉數呑噬的……</p>
<p>「哼！修橋是咱的主張，誰敢鬧！管敎誰受……」瘤大爺喘着氣，儘管對人們使威，一雙光芒的眼，照準那洪阿九的全身。</p>
<p>洪阿九繼續酒意，怒容並不减，豎起二條粗眉兒，顯意在還擊瘤大爺的樣兒，但是眼皮一刹，三個漢子便似乎領略了來意，趕過去抓住了那醉漢，很省事的，</p>
<p>掙扎，沒有用，洪阿九的脚步，開始打着歪斜，嘴角上更泛出白沫來，竟似同一隻待宰的羔羊，</p>
<p>「禍啦！阿九肇禍了……」羣衆沒有去援助，祗有這微弱的呼聲，分不出是誰說的。</p>
<p>橋，仍舊要造，洪阿九是被當作禍首看待送進了所去。</p>

<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>
<p>— 云爾</p>
<p>去年年底，曾經有人發起祝賀三對同居者盛舉過，當時簽名加入者，不下五六十位之多，但不知怎樣一來，這事情無形取消了。</p>
<p>最近，叉得到了一個不敢使人相信，而叉可靠的消息，說是有三對同居者將於二十日下午假臘雪斯跳舞學校舉行集團結婚了。</p>
<p>以前所傳的三對，是許幸之，陳露明，唐納，藍蘋，趙丹，葉露茜。而現在舉行集團結婚的，除後二對依舊外，第一對却改了顧而已和璐璐的妹妹。</p>
<p>他們的結婚儀式很別緻，大槪是由三對新人來聯合表演一個話劇。</p>
<p>婚禮之後，在晚上，便繼以跳舞。好在臘雪斯什麼都現成着有。</p>
<p>道消息看來是很不敢使人相信的，但是消息的來源很可靠，大槪不至於是有人開玩笑罷。</p>
<p>三對之後，令人想念不至的還有「老虎」鄭君星，君星如果帶了他的黃小姐同去，那麼倒也大可以加入客串表演一番。客串的理由，作爲練習結婚的「儐相」可以，作爲朋友加入祝賀也可以，甚至，作爲××也可以。不是嗎，黃小姐和我的老虎」的「友誼」，相傳不是很「成熟」了嗎？</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Flew from Chongqing to Chengdu Yesterday to Attend the Military Academy Branch Opening Ceremony, Accompanied by Qian Dajun, Xu Yuanquan, and Others; Enthusiastically Welcomed by Liu Xiang and Others</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew from Wuhan to Yichang on the 12th. For the convenience of touring the Wuxia scenery, he specially changed to a Minsheng steamer to go west on the 13th, passing through Wushan, Fengjie, Wanxian, and other scenic spots, all of which he went ashore to visit.

<h3>Nagai Visits Lin Shize to Discuss Anti-Smuggling Matters</h3>
<p>Piled-up Smuggled Goods in Tianjin Cannot be Sold</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Nagai, the Japanese Consul in Tianjin, visited Lin Shize, the Superintendent of the Tianjin Customs, at 3:00 PM on the 17th to discuss anti-smuggling matters in North China for over an hour before leaving. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding anti-smuggling in North China, the Tianjin Customs, under the instruction of Lin Shize, has begun to study the technical problems of implementation. After the Director-General of Customs issues the order, it will begin to implement the plan. The anti-smuggling staff will be increased at land and water checkpoints to form a tight organization. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to the Tianjin Customs, smuggled goods, because of the promulgation of new anti-smuggling measures, fearing strict investigation, have been desperately smuggled into Tianjin, destroying the system and testing whether we can effectively implement the new law. Recently, because too many goods have been smuggled in, they have formed a situation of being stuck, so they have to temporarily suspend transportation and wait for the goods to be sold. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Smuggled goods have been transported less and less since the 15th because a large amount of smuggled goods are piled up in a certain concession in Tianjin, and the sales routes are all blocked. Although they are trying their best to depreciate the price to sell, they cannot be sold out for a while. A certain country's smuggling rogues have set up the Sansei Yoko Company on Akashi Street in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, equipped with nine wireless radio transceivers, and have established contact with the secret transportation companies set up by smuggling groups along the coast. The scale is very large. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>

Kawagoe has been a diplomat stationed in China for many years. He is still peaceful.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The Dynamics of British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Current British diplomacy has fallen into a deep abyss of contradictions and anguish. Finding a way out of these contradictions and anguish is the anxiety of today's British diplomats. Regarding Anglo-German relations, Hitler's proclaimed goal of abolition is to restrain the Soviet Union and oppose the Franco-Soviet Mutual Assistance Treaty, which the United Kingdom is not unwilling to show some sympathy for. However, on the other hand, the United Kingdom, standing in the position of a member of the Entente and occupying a large part of the world's colonies, is determined not to lightly destroy or change the established situation and the established facts. The British Cabinet has had fierce debates on this issue. The old conservatives, such as Baldwin, advocate compromise with Germany to implement its anti-Soviet foreign policy. However, this inevitably destroys or changes the established situation and the established facts, affecting its interests in the colonies. The new conservatives, such as Eden, advocate sanctions against Germany to maintain the established situation and the established facts. However, this approach not only benefits others, allowing France to restore its hegemony on the continent, but also makes Germany and Italy collude, causing simultaneous alarms in the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Regarding Anglo-Italian relations, Italy has made continuous progress since its victory in the war in Magal and has already occupied Taixi. Recently, the northern fence of the Abyssinian army has been completely removed, and the center is shaken. The United Kingdom's hegemony in the Mediterranean and the water source of the Sudan cotton area have also been greatly threatened. France not only does not help the United Kingdom, but also sends secret glances to Rome. In the League of Nations' Thirteen-Nation Committee on April 10, it spared no effort to support the aggressor, advocating the abolition of sanctions against Italy. In this situation, if the United Kingdom wants to maintain its hegemony in the Mediterranean and the water source of the Sudan cotton area, it will have to advocate tightening sanctions against Italy to promote the early end of Italy's war of aggression against Abyssinia. However, Mussolini is now using France to assert himself and is arrogant. If the United Kingdom tightens sanctions against Italy, who knows if it will threaten the United Kingdom with the pretext of "tightening sanctions is war"?</p>
<p>In the minds of the British authorities today, there are only two ways to find a way out of this contradiction and anguish. The first is to compromise with France, even if it does not impose sanctions on Germany, it should give France a helping hand to reduce Germany's threat to France. At the same time, Abyssinia is sacrificed, and Italy is allowed to continue its attack on Abyssinia under the condition of respecting the United Kingdom's vested interests in the Mediterranean and East Africa. The second is to embrace the determination to confront Italy in the Mediterranean, tighten sanctions against Italy, first break with Italy, then separate from France, and even collude with Germany. Judging from the current situation, the United Kingdom is adopting the former strategy. The long-brewing talks between the general staffs of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium were held in London on the 15th and ended hastily on the 16th. According to a report by Havas, the United Kingdom has promised to provide military assistance to France and Belgium if the two countries encounter undeclared aggression. As for the attitude towards Italy, it is also very clear. Since the meeting of the League of Nations' Thirteen-Nation Committee on the 16th, the invading Italian army has heavily bombed Abyssinian positions and released poison gas. The United Kingdom neither accuses the Italian army of violating the 1924 Geneva Protocol nor proposes tightening sanctions. All it expresses is the hope that Italy will revise the conditions for peace with Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Although this strategy may not be a real way out of the United Kingdom's contradictions and anguish, Abyssinia has become a reward for the aggressors, and the battle for hegemony in the Mediterranean is bound to intensify. Even if the situation on the Rhine can be eased for a while, the establishment of French hegemony is not something the United Kingdom is willing to sit idly by and watch. Therefore, British diplomacy will ultimately not escape contradictions and anguish.</p>
<h3>Legislative Yuan Passes Repeal of Private Salt Punishment Law</h3>
<p>Reasons for Repealing Punishment for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 56th meeting on the morning of the 17th, with 65 members present, including Liu Zhendong. Sun Ke presided, with Liang Hancao as secretary-general. Regarding the amendment to Article 11 of the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods, it was resolved to pass the review results of the Finance and Criminal Law Committees without amendment. The original article stipulated that the Private Salt Punishment Law should be repealed when the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods is promulgated and implemented. The Central Political Committee believed that this article should be amended in accordance with Principle 5 of the original Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods: "All laws and regulations related to anti-smuggling and punishing tax evasion promulgated before the implementation of this law that do not conflict with the provisions of this law shall remain effective." However, the Yuan meeting has rejected this and retained the original article, listing four reasons: Regarding the repeal of special criminal laws, the Central Committee has repeatedly made resolutions, and the Central Administrative Law and Regulations Consolidation Committee in previous years has also unanimously advocated that punishment for tax evasion or violations should be rationalized and standardized, and proposed to repeal the Private Salt Punishment Law. Since salt tax is a type of commodity tax, and a Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods has been formulated, tax evasion on salt should naturally be subject to the provisions of the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods to avoid discrepancies and achieve uniformity. Principle 5 of the Regulations on Punishment of Tax Evasion of National Taxes can be rephrased as: All old laws and regulations related to anti-smuggling and punishing tax evasion that conflict with this law should be deemed invalid. The Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods uses the amount of tax evaded as the standard for punishment, while the Private Salt Punishment Law uses the quantity of smuggled salt as the standard for punishment. These two laws conflict with each other in one aspect. Moreover, the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods stipulates that those who intend to evade commodity tax and commit crimes of obstructing official duties, disturbing order, dereliction of duty, murder, or injury shall be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Law's chapter on multiple crimes. However, the Private Salt Punishment Law stipulates different penalties for those who commit private salt crimes and have the above-mentioned circumstances. These two laws conflict with each other in two aspects. Other conflicts are even more numerous. The Private Salt Punishment Law is a relic of the Beijing government during the third year of the Republic of China. Its harshness and disturbance to the people have long been recognized by society and are particularly incompatible with the Principle of People's Livelihood. Moreover, the Ministry of Finance of the National Government also believes that the law is too harsh, so the Regulations on Punishment of Minor Private Salt Cases were formulated in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China. Now that the Salt Law is about to be implemented, there is no need for such a harsh law to exist. Therefore, it is clearly stipulated in the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods that it should be repealed, precisely to express the government's determination to start anew with the people. The principle of repealing old laws with new laws is a natural principle in law, and the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods adopts an explicit repeal method to express its solemn meaning. Moreover, this method of repeal is not unique to this law. There are many precedents in this Yuan in the past. Furthermore, Article 10 of the Private Salt Punishment Law also explicitly states that "the provisions of Article 11 of the Salt Manufacturing Permit Regulations shall be repealed on the date of implementation of this law." Therefore, the provisions of Article 11 of this law are even more appropriate. In summary, it is clear that the Private Salt Punishment Law conflicts with the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods and is particularly incompatible with the spirit of the Central Committee's repeated resolutions to repeal special criminal laws. There is no doubt that it should be repealed. Therefore, the results of the deliberation show that the provisions of Article 11 of the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods do not violate Principle 5 of the Central Political Committee's decision and seem to have no need for amendment. At the beginning of the review of the case, in addition to Chen Changheng's report on the review process, Zhao Chen, Zheng Hongnian, Lv Zhiyi, and Luo Ding all spoke to supplement their opinions that the Private Salt Punishment Law should be repealed. However, Di Ying and Liang Hancao argued that the Punishment Law for Tax Evasion on Smuggled Goods lacked detailed regulations on punishment procedures and advocated authorizing the Ministry of Finance to formulate private salt punishment measures based on the principles of the law. However, because there were few supporters, it was not passed. (Seventeenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>

<h3>Our Ancient Artifacts Escape Danger</h3>
<p>Ship Floats Without Damage; Set to Arrive in Shanghai This Afternoon</p>
<p>Gibraltar: The Lanpura of the British Steam Navigation Company floated up this morning, and can start sailing to Marseille after noon, and then to Shanghai. It is currently being inspected by the surveyors of Lloyd's Company. No traces of damage to the hull have been found. (Seventeenth Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: The Lanpura of the British Steam Navigation Company, carrying Chinese antiquities, ran aground outside Gibraltar on Tuesday. It has now floated. No water leaks have been found in the ship. It is thought that after inspection, it will be able to prove that the ship's hull has not been damaged. After the ship ran aground, the bottom stuck to the beach. Although attempts were made to tow it out of danger, they were unsuccessful. It was then decided to reduce the load, unloading 300 tons of cargo, which was transported by cargo ships, and unloading 10 tons of fuel, which was transferred to the oil tanker of the Gibraltar Naval Dockyard. Yesterday morning, the work of moving the ship was resumed. The weather was bad the night before, but there was slight progress yesterday morning. However, before long, the northwest wind picked up again, hindering the work of raising its front and rear heavy anchors. However, since 1,300 tons of cargo and baking material had been unloaded from the ship, it was finally able to float. All the work was directed by the British naval authorities in Gibraltar. Sir Alexander Shaw, the Chairman and General Manager of the British Steam Navigation Company, was in Gibraltar when the Lanpura ran aground. Today, he witnessed the ship escaping danger. After the ship floated, it sailed to the naval dockyard opposite the northwest embankment and safely anchored. The antiques in the ship have not been moved. One of the main reasons why the ship could not be easily rescued was that the tide rose and fell by only 18 inches there. The naval tugboats had tried to tow the ship twice last night, but the first time was ineffective. The second time, the ship moved relatively easily. As for the passengers who were traveling on the ship to the Far East, they have changed to the company's Dumara and gone straight to Port Said. (Seventeenth Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Education Wang received a telegram from Ambassador Guo in the UK at 1:00 PM on the 16th, saying that the ship was still aground, and the kerosene, fuel, and heavy ordinary cargo it was carrying had been unloaded. It was hoped that it could be towed during high tide today. The company has also sent two people to inspect the ship's hull. Whether it will enter the dock first or continue sailing has not yet been determined. The British Foreign Office has agreed that if necessary, the antiques will be transferred to Wu's warship for safekeeping. There is no safety problem. (Seventeenth Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Education received a telegram from Tang Xifen at 0:20 AM on the 17th, saying that the Lanpura ship had floated, the hull was undamaged, and the antiques were safe.

<h3>Various Bandit Groups in Southern Shanxi to Be Eliminated in One Blow</h3>
<p>Xu and Liu's Bandits in Zhongyang Heavily Damaged, Southern Section of Tongpu Railway Directly Open to Traffic</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) The various bandit groups in Hejin and Jishan in southern Shanxi will be eliminated in one fell swoop by the encirclement and suppression by the central army. According to a telegram from Tang Enbo, his troops and those of the Weng Brigade have all arrived in the Koukoukou area. They have been fighting with the bandits for days, capturing many prisoners. The number of bandits killed in each route totals over a thousand. The remaining bandits of Xu and Liu in Zhongyang have been heavily damaged and are hiding in the mountains.

<p>(Taiyuan) The bandits in the Lin Yuemiao area of ​​Xiangning County were pursued and suppressed by our various armies, and they fled in embarrassment to the territory of Jixian County. Now our army is dividing up to pursue and block them. Also, the Xu and Liu bandit troops in the Sanjiao area of ​​Zhongyang were defeated by our Sun, Yang, and Li troops, and detoured through Liuyu Town and fled west towards Weiyuangou. About two thousand people arrived at the Lijiazhai area of ​​Sanjiao Town on the evening of the 14th and launched a fierce attack on our garrison soldiers. It was obvious that they had been attacked by our army in Shanxi and suffered heavy losses, and they attempted to cross the river and flee to northern Shaanxi. After being suppressed by a certain army stationed in Jiaozhen and the Xu regimental headquarters that came to support, many bandits were killed. Under the pressure of our forces, the bandits began to flee south towards the Jijiayuan area. Our Zhang regimental troops rushed to assist in the suppression, and launched a surprise attack on Jijiayuan at night. Contact was made that night, and the bandits immediately resisted stubbornly with a large number of troops. We launched a fierce attack with machine guns and grenades, and the bandits suffered heavy casualties and could not hold on, and fled in separate groups. In this battle, more than 700 bandits were killed, and our Zhang regiment also suffered casualties. According to reports, the bandit troops were the First and Second Regiments of Liu Zidan's troops. On the 14th, Ning Shiyi went to the rear general hospital on behalf of Chairman Chiang to comfort the wounded soldiers. All the officers and soldiers were deeply grateful and determined to continue fighting bravely to kill the enemy after their recovery to repay the country's kindness. As for the comfort items, they have now been sent to the Sui Dynasty Secretariat for proper distribution. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Taiyuan) Fang Keyou's Brigade and Zhang Zhengyu's Regiment attacked Liu Zidan's bandit troops in Jijiayuan on the 14th, catching the bandits by surprise and rushing forward, fighting with bayonets, killing more than 700 bandits, and 39 combatants, seizing two mortars, 34 rifles, four pistols, 16 broadswords, more than 600 rounds of ammunition, 24 mortar shells, 19 hand grenades, three horses of Liu's bandits and puppet regimental commanders, and many pack mules and donkeys. Director Yan gave the regimental commander major general status because the regiment fought bravely to kill the enemy and inflicted heavy damage on the bandits. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Yang Hucheng Departs for the Front to Supervise the Suppression</h3>
<p>Bandit Army Kills Bandit Regimental Commander</p>
<p>(Xi'an) In order to step up the work of suppressing bandits and eliminate the remaining bandits as soon as possible, Yang Hucheng left the province for the front on the morning of the 15th to personally supervise the suppression in the front lines. He was accompanied by secretaries, staff, and guards. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) According to a telegram from Magistrate He of Qingjian County, the Shaanxi Provincial Government announced that the volunteer team, together with the Shi Battalion of the garrison troops, killed the bandit regimental commander Lu Wenchang near Shizi River, and captured and killed dozens of bandit officers and soldiers. After Liu's bandits fled to Shanxi, Lu's bandits were responsible for important matters for the bandits. Now that we have eliminated them, the bandits have been scattered, and the morale of our army and people has been greatly boosted. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Dozens of counties in southern Hebei, including Julu, Renxian, Neiqiu, and Zanhuang, have received anti-communist measures: 1. Villagers and village chiefs must bear the responsibility for reporting and exposing.

Bandits were found in Julu and dispersed by the garrison troops on the 15th. Zhang Mengyu and other twelve people were captured and escorted to Baoding. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Zhao Pilian Passes Through Beiping to Go to Yan's in Shanxi</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Pilian arrived in Beiping last night from Nanjing and is scheduled to go to Yan's in Shanxi at 11:30 tonight. According to him, he has not returned to Shanxi for seven or eight months, and it is now when communist bandits have been discovered in Shanxi Province, so he is going to visit and see everything, without any other mission. He will return to Nanjing in about ten days. The situation of the bandits in Shanxi is reportedly very good. The bandits have been dispersed. After the Central Army entered Shanxi, Chen Cheng was assigned to be responsible for command in Pingding. The rumor that Shanxi will set up a temporary headquarters is not accurate. The Shanxi bandit suppression military expenses, the cabinet has asked the central government for subsidies, and a portion has been allocated one after another. The Panchen Lama will go from Tar Temple to Labrang Temple, because of the heavy snow there, it will take one or two months to return to Tibet. Cheng has agreed to go to Labrang Temple from Lanzhou to escort him. The situation in Tibet is better than before. The selection of the abbot of Yonghe Temple in Mount Wutai must also be approved by the Lamasery Temple Organization Committee before he can be appointed. A small number of communist bandits have been discovered in Xikang and are being suppressed. Mongolia has been hit by an unusually heavy snow disaster, and the central government is preparing for disaster relief. Yu plans to go to Suiyuan and Mongolia to inspect. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Remnant Bandits Fleeing in Yunnan Suffer Damage</h3>
<p>More Than Five Thousand Bandits Captured and Dispersed, An Brigade Has Arrived in Lufeng to Relieve the Siege</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yunnan Provincial Government telegraphed Nanjing on the 15th, stating that after Xiao He's bandit troops sneaked into Yunnan territory for the second time, our army divided up to intercept and block them on the east bank of the Pudu River, which belongs to Fumin. After three days of fierce fighting, more than 1,000 bandits were killed, hundreds were captured, and more than 1,000 were dispersed. The regimental commander was lost and 600 to 700 rifles and more than ten machine guns were seized. More than 1,000 men and women were rescued. As of the 12th, the bandit troops, known for their ability to fight, had almost completely destroyed the pseudo-Seventeenth Division, and the pseudo-Sixth Division Commander Zhou Yangxing (also known as Guo Peng) had indeed been killed in battle. The bandits' strength has been reduced by about a quarter. Our army is taking advantage of the situation to pursue them. The remaining bandits continued to attack Fumin, but after a fierce battle, they turned to Luoci and Lufeng, but were unsuccessful. Our army is tailing them and chasing them to the river, and we can give them a greater blow. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>(Kunming) Military news: the defenses of Luoci and Lufeng are strong. The advance troops of the remaining bandits sneaked into Guangtong. The Rong army arrived in Lu on the morning of the 15th and pursued the remaining bandits through Shezi. Also, the An Brigade reported that this brigade rushed to Lufeng to relieve the siege on the dawn of the 14th, and the bandits fled in panic to Monkey Well. Now they are tracking and pursuing them.

<h3>Central Supervisory Committee Holds Regular Meeting</h3>

<h3>Ding Shao and Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ding Shaoji, the outgoing counselor of the Embassy in Japan, arrived in Nanjing and visited Interior Minister Jiang Zuobin to report on the handover. He visited Foreign Minister Zhang and others on the morning of the 17th. He will first return to his native Hubei Province to visit relatives within days, and then come to Nanjing to take up the post of specialized committee member of the treaty. Ding said that the current situation between China and Japan was not created overnight. When I was in Japan, I told Japanese reporters that whether Sino-Japanese relations can improve depends on them, not on us. If the Japanese government can put themselves in our shoes and think from China's perspective as a Japanese person, they will be able to respect our country's minimum requirements. Our principle in diplomatic negotiations is to strive for equality in international status. Anything can be discussed with those who do not treat us with aggression, threats, or unfriendliness. Otherwise, it will be difficult to seek friendship between the two countries. After the February 26 Incident in Japan, the military still seems to be the backbone of its policy towards China, and I am afraid there will be no change. Japan recently intends to increase its troops in North China, which is almost a done deal. It may use the Boxer Protocol as an excuse to increase the number to a brigade. The adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations depends on Japan understanding China's position. There is no other way. Because the border between Japan and Russia in Manchuria and Mongolia is unclear, border conflicts occur frequently. According to recent statistics, there have been as many as nineteen conflicts. However, the situation is not serious. Some people think that we have reached the eve of the Russo-Japanese War, which does not seem to be accurate. Although both countries are preparing for war, they have no determination to start a war, because both sides have the pain of not being able to fight. Japan is expanding its propaganda and making a false show of strength, nothing more than to facilitate the expansion of its military strength and as a domestic measure. According to my observation, Japan does not have the courage to provoke a major war abroad, because the public debt and stock prices plummeted after the February 26 Incident, which greatly affected its finances. However, the Japanese have their own strategies and are seeking to recover quickly, which is not as serious as rumored. There is one thing that is worth telling the people of the country: Japan's recent improvements in industry and the development of commodities are amazing. Not only is our country suffering, but all Western countries are suffering from its dumping. Europe is not afraid of Japan's military strength, but is only afraid of Japan's commercial competition. Although they have tried various methods of resistance, it is still difficult to suppress it, because its goods are cheap, and the brains of general merchants only focus on profit. Major commercial ports in our country are all shipping Japanese goods in large quantities. There is a kind of obscuring method: Japanese goods are labeled with Western goods brands when they are in the factory, and Westerners transport them to our country's Hong Kong and Fuzhou ports, and then transport them to the mainland. Merchants think they come from overseas and are not sold by the Japanese. The price is also cheap, and everyone welcomes them enthusiastically. This kind of fake Japanese goods is almost everywhere in our country. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents in Xiamen Request Permanent Lease Rights to Real Estate</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Foreigners cannot purchase land, real estate, or permanent leases in our country. Many Taiwanese people have purchased land and real estate in Xiamen, but it is not allowed by law. The Japanese Consul has recently negotiated with us and issued a circular this week, stating that the Chinese court, according to the Supreme Court's 20th-year precedent, recognizes the permanent lease rights of our citizens to real estate in Xiamen, which is very unfavorable to our side. We are currently negotiating with the Chinese authorities. In order to collect reference materials, from around the 20th year of the Republic of China to the present, if you hold a precedent from the Chinese court recognizing the permanent lease rights of imperial citizens to real estate, please report in detail. The Taiwanese Association has notified the Taiwanese people to investigate. Recently, the city government has submitted a request to the central government for instructions on the case of Japanese monk Kanda Keun buying the old site of Daguan Garden to build Honenji Temple, but a reply has not yet been received.

<h3>Bao Yueqing Discusses the Mongol Conference, Everything Is as Usual</h3>
<p>Prince De's Relationship with the Central Government Has Never Been Interrupted, Wu Heling Assists in Official Duties in Bailingmiao</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bao Yueqing, director of the Chahar Eastern Mongolia Political Affairs Council's office in Beiping, came to Tianjin to celebrate Song's mother's birthday and to request disaster relief for the Mongolian snow disaster. He returned to Beiping after visiting Song on the 17th. According to him, Prince De's relationship with the Central Government has never been interrupted. All kinds of external rumors are acting with a purpose. Wu Heling is now assisting in official duties in Bailingmiao. Everything in the Mongol Conference is still being handled according to the Central Government's orders. The Mongol Political Affairs Council is responsible for anti-communism in Inner Mongolia. The central government has allocated 200,000 yuan for anti-communist expenses, which will be used to prepare everything. Li Shouxin's forces currently occupy more than 20 counties in Chahar territory and are quite formidable. Zhuo Shi Hai once turned against Prince De, but recently they have been reconciled and are listening to the command of the Mongol Political Affairs Council. There is heavy snow in Mongolia, and traffic is still difficult. Transportation is inconvenient due to the distance of thousands of miles. It snowed again a few days ago, causing many cattle and sheep to freeze to death. The future life of the Mongolian people is worrying. Now that the communist disaster is spreading and young people are displaced, the consequences are worrying. Therefore, Song is specially requested to: 1. Urgently provide relief. 2. Purchase cattle, sheep, and horses and distribute them to the Mongolian people for breeding. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>About 4,000 Kazakhs Flee from Xinjiang to Western Gansu</h3>
<p>There Is No Other Function Besides Being Intolerable in the New Province</p>
<p>(Lanzhou) For more than a month, about 4,000 Kazakhs who fled from Xinjiang to the area outside Jiayu Pass in Anxi County, north of Ma Zongshan, have been identified as fleeing to Gansu because they were not tolerated in Xinjiang. There is no other function. It is known that the Kazakhs are a type of Xinjiang Chan Hui, and their folk customs are strong. These people carry weapons, tents, livestock, etc., and are currently staying there, living their nomadic life. However, ten years ago, when Outer Mongolia declared independence, more than 10,000 Mongols, led by Zhasak, fled to the area south of Ma Zongshan because they opposed the independence of Outer Mongolia. Not long after, Zhasak was assassinated, and the Mongols supported a Living Buddha who was only sixteen years old as their leader. For the past ten years, they have lived in the area, surviving on their own, without anyone asking about them. Now it is known that these White Mongols and the newly arrived Kazakhs also get along peacefully and there are no conflicts, because the place is vast and there is no need to compete for land for grazing.

<h3>Philippine Authorities Restrict Overseas Chinese Business</h3>
<p>The 28 System Will Be Implemented Soon, Anti-Chinese Sentiment Occurs in Liba</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, due to the economic downturn in the Philippines in recent years, the number of unemployed scholars has increased. Also, because commercial rights are in the hands of the Chinese, in order to attract local business and remedy unemployment, they once planned to restrict Chinese business from operating small businesses, stipulating that Chinese stores must employ workers according to the "28" system, that is, eight Filipinos and two Chinese. However, because the matter was of great importance, it was not implemented immediately. After Quezon became president last year, he did not have a deep affection for the Chinese, and the immigration law was more苛 than before. Recently, the old case has been raised again and the "28" system has been re-examined and deemed feasible. An order will be issued soon, and the overseas Chinese businessmen in the Philippines will suffer even more. In addition, anti-Chinese sentiment has recently occurred in the Liba area on the east coast of the Philippines, and overseas Chinese businessmen are panicked. Our Consul General in the Philippines, Li Haoju, has notified the Philippine Ministry of Internal Affairs, requesting that it protect the lives and property of overseas Chinese and eliminate the root of the disaster.

<h3>Italy-Abyssinia Peace Talks Revised Conditions: Abyssinia Still Expresses Rejection, and Asks the League of Nations to Intensify Sanctions Against Italy. The Thirteen-Nation Committee's Mediation is Ineffective.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinia, due to Italy's refusal to negotiate peace within the League of Nations framework, has appealed to the League of Nations to implement various sanctions under Article 16 of the League Covenant. Today, the Abyssinian representative firmly rejected the peace terms proposed by Italy and notified the thirteen-nation committee, declaring this point. According to Italy's conditions: Italy does not allow the League of Nations to participate in negotiations; Italy does not want to submit its treaty terms to the League of Nations, but only to Abyssinia, treating it as negotiations between victor and vanquished; Italy does not allow a ceasefire. The chairman of the thirteen-nation committee, Madariaga, met with the Italian representative this afternoon to obtain a detailed report to convey to the other committee members. After Abyssinia rejected Italy's peace proposal, Madariaga immediately asked the Italian representative, Aloisi, to revise his conditions. Aloisi, after consulting with Rome, has agreed to make slight revisions, allowing League of Nations observers to participate in the negotiations, or to notify the League of Nations of the progress of the negotiations. The thirteen-nation committee has now decided to convey this revised plan to the Abyssinian representative. However, judging from the tone of Abyssinia's first letter, this revised plan will be rejected by Abyssinia. The thirteen-nation committee is now adjourned until 4 p.m. tomorrow. If Abyssinia does reject it, then the thirteen-nation committee can only record that reconciliation has failed. Then the eighteen-nation committee must be convened to consider intensifying sanctions against Italy. Abyssinia's letter asks the thirteen-nation committee to note that Italy refuses to engage in negotiations within the League of Nations structure in the spirit of the League of Nations, and states that the time has come for the implementation of various sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant and the fulfillment of various obligations undertaken by League members. League member states have an obligation to immediately assist the invaded country in an effective manner. The people of Abyssinia are now facing the disaster of annihilation. The Abyssinian government, in this most urgent moment, does not want to hastily believe that Abyssinia cannot obtain this protection. (Reuters, November 11)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the preliminary peace terms proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini were rejected by Abyssinia, the chairman of the thirteen-nation committee, Madariaga, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, advised the Abyssinian representative, Wolde, this morning to reconsider them. Wolde has again expressed his rejection. As for French Minister Without Portfolio, Penancier, he agreed with the Italian representative, Aloisi's proposal to immediately cease hostilities. Aloisi has not yet provided an answer. The thirteen-nation committee is scheduled to hold a meeting at 4 p.m. Its mediation efforts have effectively failed. (Havas, November 17)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is widely expected that the thirteen-nation committee's meeting at 4 p.m. today will determine whether there is any hope of bringing Italy and Abyssinia closer together. This meeting must record the success or failure of peace efforts. If reconciliation fails, then this committee must report to the League of Nations Sanctions Committee, i.e., the eighteen-nation committee. But at present, there are no arrangements for the eighteen-nation committee to meet. (Reuters, November 17)</p>
<h3>France Asks Italy for a Truce</h3>
<p>Italian Representative Asks Mussolini for Instructions</p>
<p>(Geneva) France has now asked Italy to declare a truce to prevent the failure of the thirteen-nation committee's reconciliation efforts. After the Abyssinian representative rejected Italy's revised conditions and declared that all negotiations must not go beyond the League of Nations framework and must not violate the spirit of the Covenant, French Minister Penancier went to see the Italian representative, Aloisi, saying that if Italy could officially announce a truce, even for a few days, so that the current peace talks have a chance of success, this would be a most welcome gesture. Aloisi replied that there are strategically important operations currently underway in East Africa, and this French proposal is unlikely to be adopted. However, he is willing to discuss this matter with Mussolini in Italy. (Reuters, November 17)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the issue of peace between Italy and Abyssinia, French Minister Without Portfolio, Penancier, met with the Italian representative, Aloisi, this morning and suggested to him that Italy should immediately agree to a truce. This will certainly have a great impact in the current situation and will facilitate the negotiations currently being conducted by the thirteen-nation committee. Aloisi replied that he would ask his government for instructions, but Prime Minister Mussolini is unlikely to accept this proposal. (Havas, November 17)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After French Minister Without Portfolio, Penancier, met with the Italian representative, Aloisi, this morning, he then met with the British Foreign Secretary, Eden. Eden then also met with the Abyssinian representative, i.e., the Abyssinian envoy to France, Wolde, and the chairman of the League of Nations eighteen-nation committee, i.e., the Portuguese representative, Vasco-Concelos. (Havas, November 17)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, regarding the issue of peace between Italy and Abyssinia, any negotiation procedure that goes beyond the scope of the League of Nations is opposed by Britain. It is currently believed here that the only hope for improving the peace situation is for Italy to agree to revise the conditions it has proposed. If Italy refuses to revise them, then the current sanctions measures should continue to be implemented. These sources still advocate that the League of Nations General Assembly's eighteen-nation sub-committee should be convened immediately to study the issue of intensifying sanctions against Italy. (Havas, November 16)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council's thirteen-nation committee today, the spokesman for the French delegation immediately declared that an agreement between Italy and Abyssinia has not been despaired of. However, reporters from this agency have learned that the views of the British are the opposite of those of the French, and they advocate intensifying sanctions against Italy, saying that the thirteen-nation committee's compromise work is a failure. The committee will make a clear announcement after its meeting tomorrow. (Havas, November 16)</p>
<h3>Italy's Peace Terms</h3>
<p>Official Terms Submitted Directly to Abyssinia; Meetings Must Be Held Outside of Geneva; Ceasefire to Be Negotiated by Frontline Generals</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the terms of the preliminary peace proposal put forward by Italy, reporters from this agency have learned from the Italian delegation that Italy believes that future peace negotiations can be held in a city near Geneva, such as Ouchy on Lake Geneva, as an example. However, it opposes holding them directly in Geneva. Furthermore, these negotiations should be held directly between the two parties involved. As for the League of Nations' position, the Italian government initially maintained that it would only notify it with a document after the negotiations had achieved results. Later, due to the strong requests of French Minister Without Portfolio, Penancier, British Foreign Secretary, Eden, the chairman of the thirteen-nation committee, Madariaga, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, Aloisi obtained instructions from his government via long-distance telephone, agreeing to "constantly notify" the thirteen-nation committee of the progress of the negotiations during the negotiation period. The two parties involved can also submit applications to the committee at any time. However, Italy can only submit the peace terms to Abyssinia, and it will not notify the League of Nations. The thirteen-nation committee has no objection to this, because the committee can "constantly contact" Italy and Abyssinia. After Abyssinia receives Italy's peace terms, it will naturally notify the committee. Regarding the issue of a ceasefire, the Italian government has stated that either the two sides can negotiate a ceasefire agreement, or they can negotiate preliminary articles of peace. One of the two must be chosen. However, if a ceasefire agreement is signed, then military action should cease immediately. Therefore, the demands that Italy can make must be very significant. According to Aloisi's view, it is more appropriate to negotiate a preliminary treaty at this time. (Havas, November 16) Italy has recently proposed the conditions of a "preliminary peace," the content of which is divided into two items: 1. The military authorities of Italy and Abyssinia should negotiate on the spot regarding ceasefire measures. The indigenous tribes of Abyssinia should disarm under the supervision of the Italian army to ensure the safety of the Italian army. 2. The negotiations for the "final peace" will be held by plenipotentiary representatives from the two countries at a location outside of Geneva. The League of Nations may send observers to attend the meeting, but may not directly interfere in the negotiations. It must wait until the negotiations fail, or for the sake of approving the future agreement, before it can come forward to intervene. The Abyssinian delegation has recently sent a note to the chairman of the thirteen-nation committee, Madariaga, expressing strong protests, saying that "the Italian government is nothing more than speculating and demanding high prices, as if to say that if the League of Nations can withdraw the sanctions measures and stay out of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, then Italy can help the League of Nations once something happens in Europe. The procedure it suggests, if implemented, will inevitably set a bad precedent and make the fate of small countries precarious, which the Abyssinian government cannot accept." It also said that what Abyssinia seeks is nothing more than the implementation of the basic principles of the League of Nations Covenant, which is also what the French memorandum of April 8 (regarding the Locarno case) has repeatedly stated. It is time for the various agencies of the League of Nations to take responsibility. (Havas, November 16)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italy today proposed conditions for peace with Abyssinia, advocating that before the negotiations, Abyssinia should first negotiate directly with the commander of the Italian army in East Africa, Badoglio Rivoli. Aloisi, the Italian representative to the League of Nations, insisted that the East African War should be based on the precedent of the European War, and that the general staff of the two warring countries should sign a ceasefire agreement. Therefore, the peace work of the thirteen-nation committee has almost completely stalled. The Italian representative also notified the League of Nations leaders that after this direct negotiation begins, Italy is prepared to negotiate peace terms in Ouchy, Switzerland. Italy allows the progress of future negotiations to be notified to the thirteen-nation committee, but the League of Nations itself does not need to participate, and the League of Nations must guarantee that Abyssinia will not counterattack after Italy's ceasefire. Today, Abyssinia's envoy to France and representative to the League of Nations, Mariam, and the French representative, Qi Qi, have rejected Italy's conditions in the name of the Abyssinian government. The thirteen-nation committee then held a secret meeting in the evening to listen to Chairman Madariaga's report on the peace work. (National News Agency, November 16)</p>
<h3>Thirteen-Nation Committee Meeting Held in Secret</h3>
<p>Continues to Mediate Between Italy and Abyssinia</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council's thirteen-nation committee met at 6:15 p.m. today to discuss the issue of peace between Italy and Abyssinia, ending at 7:45 p.m. The process was extremely secret. Afterwards, a public report will be issued by the League of Nations Secretariat stating that negotiations are still in progress, and stating that "the chairman of the thirteen-nation committee, Madariaga, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, held talks with the Italian delegation this afternoon, and the results obtained will naturally be notified to the Abyssinian delegation. The committee is now scheduled to continue its meeting at 4 p.m. on Friday (i.e., November 17)." It is generally known that Madariaga has requested supplementary explanations from the Italian representative, Aloisi, regarding Italy's peace terms, and is now waiting for Mr. Aloisi's reply. (Havas, November 16)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The meeting of the thirteen-nation committee today was extremely secret. Each national representative was only allowed to bring one assistant. At the meeting, the representatives of various countries mostly expressed their views, wishing to see an early end to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Eden and Administrative Council Chairman Bruce (Australian representative) also expressed their willingness to compromise, and Bruce's wording was particularly moderate, which was praised by the representatives of various countries after the meeting. As for the French representative, Penancier, he explained that the cessation of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia is the ideal of the League of Nations. This is what France is eagerly seeking, so that Italy can re-engage actively in European affairs. The committee finally decided that Chairman Madariaga and Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, should notify the Abyssinian delegation tonight that after the committee contacted the Italian representative, Aloisi, the prospects for peace are more optimistic, and that the Abyssinian representative should reconsider the situation, or revise the first note it submitted (i.e., the note protesting against Italy's conditions). However, it is generally believed that the views of the two parties involved, Italy and Abyssinia, are still divergent, and it is feared that it will still be difficult to reconcile them. (Havas, November 16)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian delegation, after conducting talks with the chairman of the thirteen-nation committee, Madariaga, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, at 11 a.m. this morning, issued a statement saying that Abyssinia still opposes the preliminary peace terms proposed by Italy. As for the request by Madariaga and Avenol to reconsider them, a reply will be submitted, and it will be sent to the thirteen-nation committee in a short period of time. The thirteen-nation committee is scheduled to continue its meeting at 4 p.m. today. (Havas, November 17)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the famous journalist Madame Tabouis recently published a commentary in the "L'Oeuvre" newspaper, saying, "Britain has not yet decided whether to impose military sanctions on Italy. As for Sir Drummond, the British ambassador to Italy, he reported to the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday that although the rainy season in Abyssinia has begun, the road from the front line directly to the Abyssinian capital has been controlled by the Italian army. The motorized units of the Italian army can drive straight in within a few days without any obstacles. Fortunately, the morale of the Abyssinian army is still strong. Even if the capital falls, they can continue to fight without surrendering. As for Italy, due to economic hardship, it is necessary to cease hostilities immediately, because the country currently has to spend huge military expenses, and after the victory, it must also pacify the region, which will also cost a lot. Its predicament is obvious. From the British point of view, Italy, after this war, will eventually feel exhausted economically, financially, and militarily. In the future, its attitude towards colonial and European issues will inevitably be more compromising." (Havas, November 17)</p>
<h3>Two Italian Aircraft Launch Rockets Over Abyssinian Capital</h3>
<p>Colors Matched to Form the Italian National Flag; A Novel Way to Indicate Occupation</p>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) Two Italian aircraft, flying slowly over here between 8:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. this morning, launched colored rockets to match the colors of the Italian national flag. (Havas, November 17)</p>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) This morning, two Italian bombers flew low over the sky here and dropped several tubes, which exploded on the ground, emitting red, white, and green smoke, which are the colors of the Italian national flag. Residents are no longer as panicked as before. (Reuters, November 17)</p>
<p>(London) According to a report from a correspondent in Cairo received by The Times, the Abyssinian Northern Army is now in a state of total collapse. Unless the rainy season arrives immediately to prevent the advance of the Italian air force, the Abyssinian army has no hope of recovery. According to what the correspondent knows, the main reason for the defeat of the Abyssinian Northern Army is that the Gala warriors of the country have been incited by the Italian army to betray the Abyssinian Emperor. At the beginning of last month, the Italian and Abyssinian armies were deadlocked in the Emba Aratchi area, which is an important area on the northern front and can be defended. However, the Gala warriors retreated without fighting, causing the Guards Brigade to retreat with them. The Abyssinian Emperor had no choice but to deploy defenses near Lake Ashenge in an attempt to contain the enemy. Unfortunately, the terrain there is far inferior to Emba Aratchi. The Italian army was able to take advantage of the victory and advance south, as if splitting bamboo. (Havas, November 17)</p>
<p>(Rome) The General Headquarters announced today that the Italian army in Abyssinia continues to advance south towards the Sudanese border, so it has gradually moved away from areas related to Britain's vital interests. The most recent target of attack will be Boni. After the Italian army occupies the area, it can expand its control and extend it to the camel trails and the Rahal River, a tributary of the Nile. After this, it will attack the Zaré and other bottlenecks of the camel trails connecting Lake Chana to Sudan. Although the Italians are extremely concerned about military affairs, they are not concerned about the policies in Geneva. According to recent rumors, General Badoglio, the commander of the Italian army in East Africa, will be stationed in the Abyssinian capital in May. The Italian army may be able to enter the Abyssinian capital within a week, because the road to the Abyssinian capital is flat and wide, which is conducive to the movement of military vehicles. The military here does not believe the claim that the Italian army has already begun to attack the Abyssinian capital, because the Italian army in Tessenei is mostly infantry. It is said that General Badoglio will first attack east and link up with the Italian army departing from Sardo and passing through the Danakil area, and then flank Harar. General Graziani will then launch an attack from the south to meet them. (National News Agency, November 16)</p>
<h3>Italian Army Bombs British Medical Team; Britain Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>Believes It Was Deliberately Provoked</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the League of Nations news released today, the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, sent a strongly worded official document to the Italian government, protesting against the repeated bombing of the British Red Cross medical team by Italian aircraft, saying that in March, the British medical team in Guarani, Abyssinia, was bombed by Italian aircraft for four consecutive days without any interruption. The Italian representative claimed that the medical team members had shot at the bombers, and that the planes were retaliating. After a detailed investigation by the British government, this statement was found to be untrue and cannot be admitted. According to the report of the chief physician, there is no doubt that the Italian aircraft deliberately provoked the situation. The British government believes that the remarks and memoranda issued by Soviet Vice-Premier Zhu are nothing more than responsible personnel trying to find excuses to cover up their bombing of the British medical team. Britain is now demanding that the Italian government make a firm statement, ordering the Italian air force to be extra cautious in the future and not to attack the British Red Cross and medical teams in Abyssinia. The British government reserves the right to demand compensation for losses. (Reuters, November 17)</p>

<h3>Bank of France Gold Reserves Decrease Again</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Bank of France recently released its weekly report (April 3 to April 10). On the asset side, cash reserves decreased by 945,000,000 francs (compared to the previous two weeks, from March 20 to April 3, gold reserves had already decreased by 2,615,000,000 francs). In addition, the total amount of discounted bills increased by 239,000,000 francs due to the approaching closing date of April 15. Securities-backed loans decreased by 65,000,000 francs. Short-term loans secured by government bonds decreased by 294,000,000 francs. On the liability side, the amount of banknotes in circulation decreased by 740,000,000 francs, and deposits decreased by 118,000,000 francs, totaling a decrease of 858,000,000 francs. The banknote reserve ratio decreased from 67.42 percent to 67.03 percent. (Havas, April 16)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Radical Socialist Party, i.e., the current government party, recently issued an appeal to the people of the country, asking voters nationwide to uphold "freedom, economic revival, and peace." It said, "For the past year or two, the Bank of France, in order to stop malicious propaganda aimed at undermining the French currency, has implemented a large-scale contraction policy in a systematic manner, but it has still failed to meet expectations. As a result, the amount that the Treasury should spend this year is as high as 16,000,000,000 francs, and the amount of gold flowing out of the country has reached a huge sum of 10,000,000,000 francs. What our party seeks is to earnestly safeguard the revival of the franc, revive the economy, protect the democratic rights of the people, and achieve the goal of limiting and reducing armaments based on collective security and mutual assistance systems, thereby realizing true and lasting peace. In addition, our party should safeguard the middle class, i.e., the foundation of France, agriculture, and the honest and sound working class to resist parasitic feudal forces and prevent them from monopolizing the banking system, controlling prices, and monopolizing goods, while allowing the middle class to bear the responsibility for mistakes."

<p>Madrid: Members of the General Confederation of Labor are currently distributing leaflets in the streets, stating that a general strike has been announced and is in effect, without specifying a time limit. The general public believes that work will resume on the first of next week. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Following the announcement of a general strike by the General Confederation of Labor, the cabinet has decided to dissolve fascist organizations and similar groups. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The police commissioner has resigned, and it is expected that a member of the Socialist Party will replace him. Police officers who sympathize with the Fascist Party will be dismissed. From yesterday to today, 180 people have been arrested for various crimes. Riots occurred in various parts of the capital this morning, but they were not serious. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The General Confederation of Labor has announced a general strike due to the repeated insults of left-wing individuals by the Fascist Party and the fact that security team members also lined up to participate in Lieutenant Rifles' funeral yesterday, which caused deep dissatisfaction. Trams, buses, trains, and subways have all stopped. All shops, except for milk shops and pharmacies, have also closed. There are hardly any pedestrians on the streets. Most newspapers, including the monarchist organ "ABC," are still publishing as usual, but demonstrators immediately burn them upon seeing them, making them impossible to sell. As of noon, no major incidents have occurred. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Communist Party and the National Labor Federation announced a 24-hour strike starting this morning, now believed to be in opposition to the government's delay in implementing the administrative procedures of the left-wing parties. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After Security Lieutenant Rifles was killed by demonstrators on the 14th of this month, the anniversary of the establishment of the Spanish Republic, Fascists took the opportunity to cause trouble again yesterday during his funeral, causing serious disturbances, resulting in three deaths and fifty serious injuries. The military and police immediately searched for Fascists and those suspected of causing trouble. As of now, it is reported that as many as a thousand people have been arrested. The left-wing People's Front has also organized special teams to patrol the streets to prevent "Fascist provocative behavior." In addition, security team members are stationed everywhere and will search anyone who looks suspicious at any time. Various labor unions and Communist and Socialist Party organizations in the capital are separately informing their members to pay attention to the development of the situation so that they can adapt to the situation. It is also reported that various labor organizations are deeply dissatisfied with the Fascist Party's recent repeated insults to left-wing individuals and the fact that security team members also lined up to participate in Lieutenant Rifles' funeral, and plan to announce a general strike to protest. However, the certainty of this has yet to be confirmed. Employees of the North Station, however, stopped working for three hours, causing passenger trains departing for France to be delayed.

<h3>Trends in the U.S. Presidential Election: Democrats Very Optimistic</h3>
<p>Republican Candidates Vie for Nomination</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic leaders today generally stated that the current primary results are sufficient to be considered an omen of government victory in this autumn's presidential election. The Republican side has made no comments. President Roosevelt's vote counts in Wisconsin, Illinois, and Nebraska all exceeded those of the Republican Party, and no one in the party is competing with him. Some observers firmly believe that Senator Borah's ability to achieve his current results in Illinois, despite being under strong opposition, is truly commendable. Chicago publisher Knox also failed to achieve a major victory, so experts believe that Knox and Borah are in a "clam and snipe" fight, only benefiting Kansas Governor Landon. Landon has not yet made any comments, but yesterday's primary results in Nebraska showed Roosevelt receiving 79,354 votes, Borah 62,420 votes, and Landon 61,472 votes. Supporters of Landon say that since Landon was not listed as a candidate, having so many votes indicates that with a little organization, he could obtain all of Borah's votes. Most experts believe that Landon is the most promising Republican candidate, followed perhaps by Senator Vandenberg. People on Landon's side claim that Landon can get 472 votes at the Republican National Convention. If so, he would be only 27 votes short of the majority needed to become the candidate.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today laid the cornerstone for the new $12 million building of the Department of the Interior and gave a speech advocating for the preservation of national resources. The trowel used by the President to lay the cornerstone was the same one used by President Washington in 1793 to lay the cornerstone for the U.S. Capitol. President Roosevelt declared that national resources, if not abundant and without policies for their preservation, would have ceased to exist long ago. It is truly astonishing that we have been developing, wasting, and misappropriating the resources of all mankind for so long and still do not find it strange. We should strive now to ensure that those who come after us can enjoy the benefits they deserve. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

The telegram you signed has established a compass, pointing the way for the American people to friendship. The Japanese people share the same sentiment and also wish for a new era of friendship between Japan and the United States. I now represent them in declaring our earnest efforts to enhance friendship." (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(New York) Former Ambassador to Japan and leader of the Far East Economic Delegation Forbes gave a speech today, calling for the repeal of the Japanese Exclusion Act, saying that if the trade balance between Japan and the United States is to be balanced, the United States should repeal the law. The main difficulty in the trade issue lies in the fall in raw silk prices and the forced increase in cotton prices. If the Monroe Doctrine in Asia is the same as the Monroe Doctrine of the United States, there should be no territorial ambitions or factors hindering trade equality. Since the Asian region is vast and cannot be occupied solely by one country, if a country insists on trying to do so, it is feared that before the fence is built, it will be disrupted.

<h3>Military Liaison Between British, French, and Belgian General Staffs</h3>
<p>Britain's Support for French and Belgian Forces is More Than Adequate</p>
<p>(London) Since the talks between the general staffs of Britain, France, and Belgium began yesterday morning, they have held four consecutive meetings and studied all the agenda items. The speed of their work has exceeded the expectations of most people. After a plenary meeting of the three delegations at the Admiralty tonight, they formally announced the closing. The French and Belgian representatives plan to hold an informal meeting tomorrow and return to their respective countries on Saturday (the 18th). According to responsible sources, the results of the talks were quite satisfactory. This was learned by the reporter of this agency, and it was also discovered that France and Belgium obtained accurate information on Britain's existing military strength in terms of defense and counter-offensive as a result of the talks, and they know that Britain's military strength can be used to assist France and Belgium with more than adequate resources, especially during counter-offensives. Britain can use bombers, fighter planes, and naval blockades of Germany to support the two countries, and the results will be significant. This is contrary to what is rumored outside. However, in terms of the army, if Britain's national defense plan is not completed in one day, the number of troops that can be transferred will be relatively weak. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Military Aircraft Crashes Near Suburbs of Swiss Capital</h3>

<h3>Turkey Requests Restoration of Military Installations in the Straits</h3>
<p>British Reply Vague</p>
<p>(London) The Turkish government sent a note to the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne on the 11th of this month, requesting an amendment to Article 18 of the treaty, which concerns the demilitarization of the Dardanelles Straits. It is reported that the British government has submitted a reply to ten countries, stating that the Turkish government has the right to submit the issue of the straits to the Council of the League of Nations for discussion. The procedure adopted by the Turkish government is legal and moderate, and the British government strongly agrees with it. Once the governments of the countries concerned believe that the issue can be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations for discussion, the British government will also be prepared to do so. However, the British government's opinion on this issue must be discussed with the various dominions before it can be expressed. According to observations of political figures here, the issue of re-establishing defenses in the Dardanelles Straits may be submitted for discussion at the next regular meeting of the Council of the League of Nations next month.

<h3>The Ministry of Industry and Commerce Compelling Business Registration is Untrue</h3>

Later, the market became increasingly firm due to the small amount of visible inventory in Australia, which was beneficial to the bulls, and the small number of weekly shipments.

<h3>South Manchuria Railway to Control North China Transportation</h3>
<p>Operating Nine Automobile Routes Within the War Zone</p>
<p>Interconnecting with the Pseudo-Jehol Railway</p>
<p>Planning to Establish a Commercial Port at Dalingkou</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: The North China economic development being carried out by the Japanese Garrison Headquarters in Tianjin in conjunction with the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu) has become a mutually supportive strategy. Although the Japanese military's economic advisory department (also known as the General Staff Headquarters) seems to be developing plans independently, separate from military affairs, its ultimate goal is still to support future military convenience. The economic development methods formulated by Mantetsu, such as building the Cangshi Road, mining the Longyan iron and coal mines, and building a steel mill in Tangshan, Pingxi, are also intended to supply future military needs. In the middle of last month, Ishimoto Kenji, the Mantetsu representative in Tianjin, convened a meeting in Tianjin to organize the materials from the first stage of the investigation and summarize the proposals from representatives stationed in various places. He then took them back to Dalian to present to Matsuoka Yosuke, the president of Mantetsu. Recently, Matsuoka convened a special meeting for this purpose, which was attended by representatives from Mantetsu offices in North China. Even before its resolutions have been implemented, it has been decided to first complete the automobile transportation network between the war zone, the Great Wall passes, and Tianjin and Beijing, as a starting point for future economic development. It is planned to establish the North China Automobile Transportation Company within the Tianjin office, with the Tianjin office director Ota Masao concurrently serving as director. The designated automobile routes are nine:  Shanhaiguan to Jianchangying,  Tangshan to Xifengkou,  Duolun to Zhangjiakou,  Beiping to Chengde,  Luanxian to Leting,  Tianjin to Tangshan,  Tianjin to Tanggu,  Tianjin to Beiping,  Beiping to Zhangjiakou. Of the above nine routes, the Shanhaiguan to Jianchangying route has always been operated by the Shan-Jian Automobile Transportation Company, established by the pseudo-Manchukuo Railway Bureau. The Tangshan to Xifengkou route and the Zhangjiakou to Duolun route are operated by the Mingxin Automobile Transportation Company and the Zhang-Duo Automobile Transportation Company, respectively, established by the International Transportation Company. The Beiping to Chengde route has been operated by the Pingcheng Automobile Company organized by Sakata. All of the above routes were purchased separately by Mantetsu on April 10th and contracts were signed. From now on, the business of long-distance automobiles within the so-called war zone, south of the Great Wall, and north of Tianjin and Beijing will be entirely operated by the newly established North China Automobile Transportation Company in Tianjin. The company will purchase one hundred passenger and freight automobiles and connect with the Yechi, Jin-Chao railways, and Cheng-Gu automobile road within the territory of Rehe. The capital is set at 500,000 yuan. The automobile roads traversed will be built by the Mantetsu-assisted Construction Department of the pseudo-Hebei-East Autonomous Anti-Communist Council. The goal is to control North China's transportation within six months, and at its core, it has more subtle and mysterious connections to military affairs. In January, the Naval Ministry planned to build a military and commercial port at the mouth of the Luan River in Eastern Hebei. This plan has now become a thing of the past, but recently, the pseudo-Hebei-East government has proposed to open Leting Daling River mouth as a commercial port. The construction costs are borrowed from the Mantetsu company, and the construction is scheduled for five years, to be managed by the Construction Department of the pseudo-Hebei-East government, which will hire Japanese engineers from Mantetsu to design it. According to the pseudo-government's own claims, the motivation for building the port is that there are no good commercial ports in eastern Luan, and Tanggu and Qinhuangdao are both too narrow and are subject to annual freezing. This year's ice blockage, for example, has disrupted ship traffic and caused severe losses. The Daling River has been inspected and surveyed by Chinese and foreign personnel and is better than the ports of Qin and Tang. In the past, the Zhili Provincial Assembly planned to build a wharf there, 24 li into the sea, where the largest European and American ships could dock and berth directly, and lay a railway directly from the port to the Rehe Railway. Goods brought in by ship could be unloaded there and loaded onto trains, and goods transported by train could be loaded onto ships and transported abroad. It was estimated to cost more than 75 million yuan, with the port and road projects proceeding simultaneously. Later, due to political changes, it was not realized. Dr. Sun Yat-sen also designated the area as one of the three major good ports in the north and established the Northern Great Port Preparatory Office to conduct climate measurements, test warm currents, and survey routes. The pseudo-Hebei-East government does not have the ability to open the port, but it is actually planning to proceed with it, so the subtle relationship is self-evident. (14th)</p>
<h3>Serious Spring Famine in Hua County, Henan; Poor People Rise Up to Seize and Distribute Grain</h3>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: Hua County has suffered years of drought and flooding, and the crops have failed. The lives of farmers are difficult, and they have reached the extreme. The spring famine is especially severe this year. Most of the food supplies rely on external sources, but these are hoarded by speculators at the Wangzhuang Railway Station. Local rich farmers have also buried all of their surplus grain, making the food problem even more dire. Traitors are taking the opportunity to incite people, calling for "everyone to share the food." As a result, grain seizures have occurred. It started in the Wadian Town of the Eighth District, where more than 800 poor people occupied the Fuxing Temple outside the north gate of the town, guarded the gate, and prohibited entry and exit. Their momentum was fierce, and they declared their intention to seize grain. After persuasion by the joint security director of the town, gentry merchants and wealthy households collected more than 2,000 yuan to establish a porridge kitchen and provide meals immediately, and the disturbance subsided. However, incidents followed in Cizhouzhai, Jiaoguangji, Tunjiaji, Yangzhao, and other places. Now, in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Districts, there are almost no villages without them. There is a tendency for it to spread throughout the county. (15th)</p>
<h3>Private Banknotes in Xianyou, Southern Fujian, Cease Redemption; More Than 300,000 Yuan Affected</h3>
<p>Mostly Held by Farmers</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The currency used in Xianyou County, which belongs to southern Fujian Xinghua district, is mostly paper money privately issued by merchants, called "Jiao Piao." The businesses that issue these banknotes are called "Piao Ju." Since the 15th year of the Republic (1926), "Piao Ju" have been opened and have issued banknotes, but mostly with the aim of collecting money and profiting by purchasing longan agricultural products and sugar from farmers with paper money. Therefore, some have capital of only a few thousand yuan but issue banknotes worth tens of thousands of yuan. In the 18th year of the Republic (1929), all Piao Ju were once cancelled, and the Tongyi Piao Ju was jointly established by various merchant guilds to issue banknotes. By the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), other Piao Ju sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain, but they collapsed in less than a year, leaving only Tongyi Piao Ju. The abandoned banknotes from the bankrupt banks flowed into the hands of the people and have not yet been redeemed. According to the investigation, Xuanlong owed 81,771 yuan, Xinyi 41,803 yuan, Xiandong 17,054 yuan, Limin 7,865 yuan, Xianyi 2,742 yuan, Tonghe 4,126 yuan, Fuxiang 1,161 yuan, Minyou 468 yuan, Fengmei 1,227 yuan, totaling 158,217 yuan. The losses suffered by farmers have been extremely severe. Unexpectedly, Tongyi Piao Ju also went bankrupt at the end of last year. For a time, there was almost no currency in circulation in the entire county, which almost caused a major disturbance. Although the county government arrested Chen Feiting, the chairman of the bank, and strictly ordered him to find a way to redeem the banknotes, due to a lack of funds, only over a thousand yuan of 2-jiao banknotes have been redeemed to date. According to the bank's liquidation report, as of March 23, the banknotes issued and circulating among the people that have not been redeemed include 17,710 yuan in 5-yuan notes, 82,193 yuan in 1-yuan notes, 38,584 yuan in 5-jiao notes, and 3,080 yuan in 1-jiao notes, totaling 151,567 yuan. There is currently no concrete plan for redemption. Including the unredeemed jiao banknotes from the already bankrupt banks, the total reaches more than 300,000 yuan, mostly in the hands of farmers.

<h3>Xinjiang Women Highly Value Chastity</h3>
<p>Ma Si-Wu-De Writes Article Offering True Introduction</p>
<p>Beijing News: Since a Xinjiang dispatch was published containing erroneous information about the issue of chastity among Xinjiang women, Hui Muslims in various places have been extremely indignant. Two newspapers in Beiping were even vandalized, causing disputes. Mai Si-Wu-De, a member of the Central Committee from Xinjiang, who is currently in Beijing, recently wrote a special article introducing the issue of chastity among Xinjiang women, entitled "A Mother's Most Sacred Responsibility." The original text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>Mothers Protect Their Daughters' Chastity</p>
<p>In Xinjiang, the most sacred and most important responsibility that mothers shoulder, is to protect the chastity of their daughters. Proof of such chastity lies in the hymen. To meet this responsibilty, pitiful mothers devote countless methods toward that goal. Daughters, precious as their own hearts, are prohibited from any strenuous activities once they reach the age of 12. Even seemingly innocuous things such as skipping and jumping are meticulously guarded against. The honour, glory and shame of their families and their races are fully entrusted upon their daughters. They have faith in and work hard at these methods. Some points are embarrassing to speak of, but I must bring them up. On the very day of the wedding celebrations, all people are filled with the highest of spirits, but the mothers display a somber air of worry. Their worries are triggered by the fear that their daughters' virginity might be found to be lacking, which would bring immense shame upon their families and their race. The mothers are only able to force a faint smile by thanking the heavens and trusting in good fortune when their daughters have been verified to have virginity by their husbands and verified by both families. Only then do mothers gain the right to flaunt and brag by wearing smiles in their homes. The entire family, the entire race, will hold them in respect. If not, then the family stove of the newly formed home will become cold. Not only will the husband reject her, the father will also turn his mother away, as she had not been able to protect her daughter's chastity. Both families will henceforth become sworn enemies. Gentlemen who have been to or are going to Xinjiang to explore, it is possible that you have not paid attention to the delicate details of the issue of chastity. Now I implore you to understand.</p>
<p>A Woman Cannot Let Others See Her</p>
<p>Let's put aside whether</p>
<p>or not this is fundamentally</p>
<p>a religious issue. The most conservative of Xinjiang's Hui Muslim scholars, the ahongs, advocate the separation of men and women. Women cannot let others see them, except for their husbands. They must cover their faces with veils. They claim such advocacy is rooted in their religious duties. The most fiercely debated and even bloody issue that pits the ahongs against the reformists is the issue of veils. Have you seen an ahong of the Muslim faith ever encounter a woman wearing a veil without averting their eyes? They consider it sinful to look upon a woman. I think this is widely known. If you have not seen such a thing, then you cannot be considered to have visited Xinjiang. Given all of these facts, how could pitiful mothers allow their eleven or twelve-year-old daughters' first night rights to be enjoyed by the ahongs? At the same time, how would ahongs with such conviction ever dare commit such illegal acts? Liars who confuse right and wrong, can we force you to admit the lies, or will you admit it yourselves? The sins of those who fabricate rumours for money have landed upon your heads. Are you even responsible for the lies that you have told?</p>
<p>Islam Forbids Prostitution and Gambling</p>
<p>For a long time now, we have paid attention to the issue of prostitution amongst the Islamic code of laws. What is (haram)? It is to say that matters forbidden by the Lord should be refrained from at all times. For example, one should not eat pork, drink alcohol, or engage in prostitution. Everyone, so long as they are a Muslim or a Muslim child, can understand and obey these tenets. The ahongs teach these values to the people at all times. They must themselves obey the strict laws before they can teach it to others. After these principles have spread throughout society and the people, people have welcomed and accepted them without needing to be asked. This is one of the most important reasons that Islam could so deeply entrench itself within the Turkish race. The Turkish race places great emphasis on protecting chastity under the Islamic code of laws. This concept is deeply compatible with the convictions of the Turkish race. Which race nowadays closes up their grown daughters inside their homes so that strangers may not see them? Which race makes women cover their faces when they go outside? Which race locks their daughters in tightly guarded carts when they travel? Why do they allow foreigners to scold us for being conservative and unliberated? Why do they suffer people's scorn? These are all methods that have been found in order to protect their own chastity. Have any of you who have travelled to Xinjiang seen such things? If you have seen it, have you researched into their causes? Should a scholar of race or of social customs not bring this kind of research to the eyes of the Han Chinese? Do you still expect society to believe your illogical, irrational ramblings which were made to show off? Do you still think that Chinese society is that infantile? Nonsense. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hubei Establishes Tonglin District in Xiangyang</h3>
<p>Dividing into Five Zones to Reclaim Over 500,000 Mu of Wasteland</p>
<p>Aiming to Plant 30 Million Tung Trees Within Five Years</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: Tung oil products occupy an important position in China's export surplus. In a time of frequent disasters and economic depression, promoting tung tree planting is especially important for economic construction. Last year's flood in Hubei province caused losses of over half of agricultural products, but the tung oil production was 300,000 dan, worth 5 million taels of silver. The people relied on it to recover from the disaster. As a result, the issue of tung tree planting has attracted widespread attention. The provincial government has already issued an order to the entire province to make widespread tung tree planting the main forestry policy this year. Xiangyang has many uncultivated barren mountains and wasteland, which are very suitable for tung tree planting. The former Administrative Commissioner of the Eighth District, Cheng Zerun, has drafted a plan to establish a large-scale tung forest area in Xiangyang and submitted it to the provincial government for approval. It is planned that all land in the county, except for cultivated land, will be made into a tung forest area. It is estimated that 30 million tung trees will be planted in five years, and after ten years, the annual income will be more than 3 million yuan and less than 30 million yuan. The steps are divided into five years of tung tree planting, carried out during the agricultural off-season in spring and winter each year. In the first year (1936), 6 million trees will be planted (divided into spring and winter). In the second year (1937), the third year (1938), the fourth year (1939), and the fifth year (1940), 6 million trees will be planted each year. The areas will be selected from the barren hills and plains of Xiangyang. In the first year, it is planned to designate the surrounding areas of various temples such as Nanxizao Pond, Guyin Temple, Yanqing Temple, Ganquan Temple, Xianshi Temple, and Wolfo Temple, each with an area of 15-16,000 mu, totaling 100,000 mu, as the first tung forest area in Xiangyang County. In the second year, it is planned to designate the 100,000 mu of long hills from Weishan Mountain and Lumen Temple to Pangju Temple as the second tung forest area. In the third year, it is planned to designate the 100,000 mu of mountains, earth ridges and Bawang Mountain from Wangjiaji to Chenjiaji as the third tung forest area. In the fourth year, it is planned to designate the 100,000 mu of hills near Longzhong as the fourth tung forest area. In the fifth year, it is planned to designate the 100,000 mu of hills in the Wushao Ridge southwest of Baimadong as the fifth tung forest area. The locations of the above tung forest areas are all not far from the Han River, and transportation is quite convenient. This spring, sowing will be carried out at the aforementioned locations first. If there are insufficient numbers, it is planned to select barren land in the Luyan post area of the Sixth District of the county, such as Ganggou, Zhao Gang, Qiaowa, and other places with relatively sloping ridges and poor soil quality, and sow 10,000 mu. It is estimated that 180 tung seeds are needed per mu, which is about one sheng. 100,000 mu will require about 1,000 shi of seeds. 50,000 mu will be sown this spring. Please have the provincial government distribute 500 shi of tung seeds. In the future, 1,000 shi of tung seeds will be prepared each year, which will be sufficient. Regarding the work, each person's daily labor can sow four mu of tung trees. For 100,000 mu, about 25,000 workers are needed, divided into spring and winter, with about 12,500 workers needed each season. With five workdays per person, about 2,500 people are needed, who will be recruited from the nearby strong men in the tung forest area in accordance with the people's labor service regulations. Students from agricultural and forestry experimental schools will be in charge of the guidance work, and some long-term workers will be hired to take charge. As for the 10,000 mu in Luyan Post area, the district agricultural school will be fully responsible. For management personnel, a forest police team will be organized, and officials from the public service agencies in the tung forest area and the abbots of various temples will be dispatched for short-term training, so that they can each return to their original positions to take charge. For the sake of thorough management of the affairs of each forest area, a management committee will be specially established to manage everything. If tung oil seeds are not cultivated after sowing, the development will inevitably decline. It is planned to carry out cultivation twice a year. The first time will be after the sap flows in spring, and the second time will be during the tree's dormancy period. The labor of the two cultivations each year will be undertaken by the security team and the strong men of each bao, which will not violate agricultural time and will also obtain the benefits of production. Long-term cultivation and fertilization will be carried out by the hired long-term forest police. The distribution of other benefits will be discussed and decided by the tung forest management committee, taking into account the harvest situation and the current situation. As for the repayment of the seed money, about 15-16,000 yuan is needed to purchase 1,000 shi of tung seeds each year. Please have the provincial government purchase and distribute it in advance. As for the method of repaying the seed money, it is planned to include 5,000 yuan in the Xiangyang production and construction budget each year to repay a part. On the day the tung seeds are profitable, Chudi will be returned as soon as possible. After tung oil is planted, if the land is suitable, tung oil seeds can be produced after three years. To improve the quality and quantity of tung oil and accelerate the process for the aforementioned large number of tung trees and tung seeds, a new-style mechanical oil mill should be established in the third year. If this oil mill requires a large amount of money, and the county government's production and construction funds are insufficient, a request will be submitted to the provincial government for subsidies, or commercial shares will be solicited for management.

<h3>Kunshan Strangles Daughter to Death; Father Detained for Legal Action</h3>
<p>Lu Jingshi, the head of Zhouxiang Township in the Sixth District of Kunshan County, had a son named Bingyuan, who is currently an elementary school teacher. At around 7:00 p.m. on the 21st of last month, he suddenly slashed his newly born two-month-old daughter's face twice, causing the bridge of her nose to break and blood to flow profusely. Although he was persuaded by others to seek medical treatment, it was ultimately ineffective, and she died on the 16th. The incident was learned of by the police officers of the Public Security Bureau, who immediately detained Jingshi and his son, as well as the child's mother, Ms. Chen, and the judiciary sent personnel to verify the facts and deal with them strictly according to the law.</p>
<h3>Bandits Found Again in Suzhou East Tai Lake</h3>
<p>Recently, major robbery cases have occurred frequently in the lakeside villages of Wu County. Therefore, the Wu County water and land police and the provincial security team set off on the 14th in seven routes to conduct a joint patrol and suppression. However, the search and suppression yielded nothing. The water and land police teams returned to their respective defenses on the 15th. Unexpectedly, two bandit ships were found near the Xinkai River Maoqi Port in East Tai Lake on the evening of the 16th, carrying more than 20 bandits with firearms. They were spotted by local fishing boats, who stealthily reported to the nearby water and land police. However, when they went to arrest them, the bandit ships had already disappeared. Zhang Hanwei, the director of the Wu County Public Security Bureau, ordered all branch offices in the townships to investigate strictly and arrest the bandits as soon as possible and punish them according to the law to deter the bandits because Chen Muxiang was kidnapped, a ransom was demanded, and Shen Rushen was torn up by the bandits and his body was abandoned near Guanyin Mountain.</p>
<h3>Official Police Murder Case Scheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>The official police murder case in Guanzai Lane, where the main culprit He Naikang and others refused to accept the death sentence imposed by the local court and appealed to the High Court, has been summoned once. Now the High Court has summoned a large number of relevant witnesses, more than thirty people, and has scheduled a court hearing on the 20th and 21st of this month in two days.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Merchants in Various Counties Vigorously Fight for Business Tax</h3>
<p>Representatives of the oil cake industry from more than ten counties, including Danyang, Wuxi, and Suzhou, held a meeting in Suzhou the other day to vigorously fight for the soybean cake business tax rate. They elected Yu Shengzu and four others as representatives and scheduled to gather in Zhenjiang on the 20th to petition the Provincial Government's Department of Finance, requesting a reduction in the tax rate. The soybean cake industry has always been taxed at a rate of 2/1000, which has now been changed to 5/1000. They still request a reduction to 2/1000 to ease the burden on merchants.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Green Town Fish Merchants Suspend Business</h3>
<p>Although Qingyang Town is a major town in the Sixth District of Jiangyin County, business is prosperous, but commercial transactions and market prices are all based on news from Wuxi. It is very close to towns such as Shizhuang North Qifang Yeqiao in Xijing, and has a close commercial relationship with Xiyi. It is learned that there was originally a small vegetable market in the town on Dantong Road, but business was not very developed due to its remote location. Later, it was moved to the Majia Field in Beilong for business, but the place was outdoors and there were no houses. If it rained, snowed, or was hot, it could not be sold. Therefore, vegetable vendors complied with the regulations superficially, but fishmongers built buildings and opened fish shops for business on both sides of the Central Bridge. Recently, the town paid attention to cleanliness, and Inspector Ding Jiarong of the Second Public Security Sub-Station was ordered to ban the opening of fish shops in the buildings next to the bridge, and summoned the shop owners Wu Zu'an, Chen Zaiyao, Zang Agou and others one after another, ordering them to close their shops. After people temporarily bailed them out for reconsideration, starting yesterday (the 16th), the town's fish merchants suddenly suspended business uniformly, waiting for a solution.</p>
<h3>Nantong Nine Chang Fishing Fleets Set Sail in Large Numbers</h3>
<p>Due to the approaching peak season for yellow croaker, fishing boats from the nine coastal Chang areas of Tongshu in Jiangbei set sail in large numbers. There are more than 1,000 fishing boats on the ocean surface in the Shengsi Dongsha fishing areas. The water police escort fleet has now set sail in separate areas. The sea is calm during this fishing season, and the fishing harvest is expected to be very promising.</p>
<h3>Bandits in Eastern Township Rampant</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the severe spring famine in the Yuxi area of the Eastern Township of Tongyi, bandits took the opportunity to wreak havoc. The families of Ji Jinhua and others were robbed, and many people were injured and killed. The attack team has rushed to suppress the bandits.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Jiangsu Bank Small Loans</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Bank is providing relief to small-scale industrial and commercial businesses by offering small loans for industrial and commercial activities. However, they must be introduced by local industrial and commercial groups. Therefore, applicants for loans must be reviewed and certified by the guild and then transferred to the Chamber of Commerce before they can be granted a loan. The maximum amount is 2,000 yuan, with a term of four months. If the loan is not repaid on time, the guarantor will be held fully responsible. Preparations are now underway, but such loans are difficult to be comprehensive without administrative protection. A request has now been submitted to the provincial government to order all counties to notify industrial and commercial groups to assist. It is also heard that in the future, chambers of commerce in various counties will have to organize a loan review committee to specialize in this matter.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou, Villagers from the Western Suburbs Come to the City to Petition</h3>
<p>Recently, due to land price issues, hundreds of villagers, including men, women, the old, and the young, from the area of the earthwork project site outside the West Gate of the county gathered on the 16th, each holding a small flag, and came to the city to petition the county government. Subsequently, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhang led a team to inform them that the government had already decided on a method regarding the land price that should be given, and they should wait patiently for it to be issued. The villagers, believing that their request had yielded results, then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Woman During a Temple Fair</h3>
<p>In Caowang Market, a village belonging to this county, during a recent temple fair, Li Longbao, a stonemason and follower of Chen Dengxin, led dozens of people, including Xu Rongchang and Tian Chaoda, and forcibly took He Qiqin's sister back to his home, intending to rape her. The woman refused and sent a message home. Upon hearing the news, the He family, with the help of local guards from both sides, took the woman back. They have filed a lawsuit with the court, accusing them of rape.</p>
<h3>Epitaph of the Ming Dynasty Martial Virtue General</h3>
<p>The Jiangdu Construction Bureau's earthwork project site unearthed the tomb of General Liu of Martial Virtue from the Ming Dynasty. Inside was a stone epitaph, which workers concealed without reporting. Now, Construction Bureau Chief Shu Guohua has secretly instructed supervisors Wan Jiasheng and others to investigate. On the 15th, it was found under the workers' thatched shed and has been moved to the project office.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou, Reduction in Rice Transportation Costs on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau has received a letter from the Zhejiang Construction Department stating that this province is a rice-deficient area, and the food produced is not sufficient for consumption. Now that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has been opened to Nanchang, Jiangxi Province has an annual surplus of 2 million dan of rice, which can be transported to Zhejiang to supplement the food supply and regulate food prices. However, due to the high cost of railway transportation, each dan costs 9 jiao. They have requested a reduction in price to benefit the people's food supply. The railway bureau yesterday sent Transportation Section Chief Zeng Shirong to the Construction Department to discuss price reduction methods, which will be implemented after seeking instructions from Director-General Zeng. In addition, the railway bureau, due to the increasing volume of cargo transportation between Nanchang and Hangzhou, has purchased seventy more freight cars to be transported to Hangzhou for use and has allocated 30,000 yuan to build seven warehouses along the line to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing, Jiahe Cloth Factory Announces Liquidation</h3>
<p>The Jiahe Cloth Factory in Jiaxing's Xihe Street, which has been in operation for more than 30 years, is divided into more than ten departments, including iron looms, wooden looms, dyeing, and refining. During its peak, there were more than 1,000 male and female weavers. The cloth produced was sold in major ports throughout the country, and there was also a distribution office in Shanghai. In recent years, affected by the commercial downturn, sales have been sluggish. Even the retail department has struggled due to weak purchasing power, making it difficult to manage finances. As a result, the factory has suffered significant losses. After a meeting of shareholders yesterday, it was decided to liquidate and close down the factory. Cao Tingrong, Gu Suming, Jiang Laixian, and others were appointed as liquidators. The liquidation process began on the 17th. It is said that wealthy merchants such as Bao Chu and others will take over the factory and continue its operation. However, during this liquidation period, the livelihoods of over 700 weavers will be greatly affected, which is truly pitiful.</p>
<h3>Tax Collection Office Strictly Urges Payment of Land Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government, in accordance with orders to urge the people to pay old taxes, has established a Tax Collection Office and appointed a director to be in charge. It is understood that after the establishment of the office, it has prepared a list of major households with outstanding taxes, along with the amounts owed, and ordered police officers to urge payment from each household. Those who delay will be summoned and forced to pay. It is reported that many major households have been summoned and forced to pay. In less than a month since its establishment, the office has collected nearly 100,000 yuan in back taxes, which is a remarkable achievement. It is expected that after the spring harvest, the revenue will be even greater.</p>
<h3>Huang Shao Visits Jiaxing for Inspection</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shao-hong arrived in Zhapu from Hangzhou on the afternoon of the 16th to inspect everything. He then went to Pinghu for inspection. At 3 p.m. on the 17th, he took his own car from Pinghu to Xinfeng to inspect the police district. At around 4 p.m., he arrived in Jiaxing and went to the headquarters of the 57th Division to inspect. He then gathered all the staff of the county government and the second-term trained baozhang at the Zhongshan Hall for instructions. At 6:15 p.m., after the instructions, he inspected the county government and stayed overnight at the Yadong Hotel. On the 18th, he reviewed the baozhang and the police force.</p>
<h3>Mingguang, Formation of Anti-Opium and Anti-Drug Patrol Team</h3>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government, recognizing that the existing anti-opium and anti-drug institutions in various counties are inadequately equipped and have had little success, Chairman Liu and Special Commissioner Zhong discussed and decided to form four anti-opium and anti-drug patrol teams in each county. Experienced anti-opium experts will be hired to participate. The province will be divided into four districts, and each team will be assigned to work in a specific area. It is stipulated that each team must help at least 50 opium addicts quit in each county they visit. The organization of these teams is currently underway.</p>

<h3>The Central Mint's Newly Minted Subsidiary Coins for March, the Review Committee Held a Regular Meeting Yesterday and Approved Their Release</h3>
<p>The Review Committee of the Central Mint held its 32nd regular meeting at the Central Bank at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Kong Xianxi was in Beijing on official business and was replaced by Committee Member Chen Xing as chairman. Twenty-one committee members attended, including Ye Zhuotang, Bei Songsun, Song Hanzhang, Shi Bimen, and Geng Aide. Deputy Director Wei Jingzhou of the Central Mint and Secretary Shi Daosheng, Chemical Examiner Ge Laide, and Meeting Recorder Li Zhezhang also attended. In addition to approving the minutes of the previous meeting, the Secretary reported that the Committee had supervised the addition of stamps to 290 Class B (880 fineness) bars and the sealing of five types of subsidiary coins in March 1936. These included 4,090,000 ten-cent nickel coins, 2,280,000 five-cent nickel coins, 280,000 five-cent nickel coins, 18,000,000 one-cent copper coins, and 16,800,000 half-cent copper coins, all of which were approved for release. A list was also published. The Committee also carefully reviewed the factory's operations, audited the factory's accounts, tested the miscellaneous materials entering the factory, and examined the work situation in February, all of which were approved. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Central Bank Recalls and Destroys Copper Coins and Silver Dimes</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance issued new subsidiary coins, it is currently recalling and destroying copper coins and silver dimes. It has ordered the Central Bank to handle this. In addition to purchasing them directly, the bank has also reached an agreement with the city's tram companies and public transportation companies to jointly purchase them at the legal price and send them directly to the Central Mint for storage. It is said that the bank has already collected 500,000 yuan worth of copper coins, totaling 10 million coins. The copper material can be melted down and recast into new coins. However, this matter must be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Specifically Approves Two Banks in Jiangsu Province to Issue New Subsidiary Coin Notes with a Total Value of One Million to Recall Miscellaneous Notes from the Xuzhou Official Exchange Bureau; Preparations Are Underway for the Production and Issuance of One, Two, and Five Jiao Notes</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recognizing that the jiao notes issued by the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Exchange Bureau are widely circulated in the rural areas of northern Jiangsu, while the counties in southern Jiangsu do not need them and there are discounts when they are circulated, and some refuse to accept them, believes that these jiao notes are hindering the circulation of legal tender. It had intended to request the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to exchange them for new subsidiary coin notes, but the subsidiary notes printed by these three banks are not sufficient for distribution. Therefore, it specifically consulted the Ministry of Finance to temporarily allow the Jiangsu Bank and Farmers Bank to issue 6 million yuan to recall these miscellaneous notes and regulate the market.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Specifically Approves. The Ministry of Finance, after considering the Jiangsu Province's request, has replied to Jiangsu Province, stating that since the central government is currently minting new subsidiary coins, the requested issuance of 6 million yuan in subsidiary coin notes is too large. Furthermore, since the Xuzhou Pingshi Official Exchange Bureau increased the issuance of jiao notes in 1932, the amount circulating in the counties of northern Jiangsu does not exceed 3 million yuan. The copper coin notes previously issued have also been gradually recalled, so such a large amount is not necessary. For the purpose of recalling miscellaneous notes and regulating the rural economy, the two banks are temporarily allowed to fulfill their obligations and issue 3 million yuan in subsidiary notes. They must pay 40% in cash and 60% in guarantee reserves in accordance with the law. It is also stipulated that when the central government has sufficient new subsidiary coins, they will be recalled and destroyed.</p>
<p>Printing and Issuance Begins. It is learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank have been ordered to fulfill their respective obligations and begin printing subsidiary notes. The types of subsidiary notes include one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao notes. It is expected that they will begin circulating in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province in early June to recall various miscellaneous notes in order to consolidate the policy of unified currency. The branch offices of the two banks in various counties will have exchange points for Xuzhou official notes. At that time, people can go directly to exchange them.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Continues to Purchase 50,000 Sheets of Silkworm Eggs from Japan</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have begun to sprout, and the eggs will be distributed in twenty days. All silkworm eggs have been distributed. In addition to the improved silkworm eggs owned by the country, eggs have also been purchased from Italy and Japan, and have been continuously transported to the country. Currently, Jiangsu Province is still short of 50,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and has sent personnel to Japan to purchase them. They will be transported to Shanghai and then transferred to the province for distribution to various regions.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Special Products Exhibition Requests a 50% Reduction in Transportation Costs</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Special Products Joint Exhibition is scheduled to open on May 1st, with locations in Nanchang and Hangzhou. It is stipulated that transportation costs for exhibits within 500 kilograms are free, those between 500 and 1,000 kilograms will be charged half the price, and those above 1,000 kilograms will be charged the full price. The Shanghai Collection Office is located at the National Goods Factory Association. The association has stated that exhibition goods have historically been charged half price and requested that all fees be charged at half price.</p>
<h3>The Fish Market Officially Transferred Yesterday Morning; Ministry of Finance Specially Sends Secretary Qian Maoxun to Supervise the Inventory; Minister Wu Will Come to Shanghai to Preside Over the Opening Ceremony; Opening Decided for May 1st</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Fish Market Management Committee was established and the general manager and deputy managers were appointed, General Manager Wang Xiaolai went to Beijing twice to meet with Minister Wu for instructions. He returned to Shanghai the night before last and went to the fish market with Director Du Yuesheng and others yesterday morning to take over the market buildings, documents, contracts, and other items. Former Manager Jin Kai Zhan led the staff of various departments to hand over the items. The opening date of the market was decided to be May 1st. Minister Wu will come to Shanghai to preside over the ceremony. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Goes to Beijing. When the Fish Market Board of Directors was established, two directors and one supervisor were appointed to handle the takeover with the general manager and deputy managers. At that time, General Manager Wang, because the market was about to open, had to decide on the internal organization and business policies. Therefore, he went to Beijing twice to meet with Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang for instructions. He returned to Shanghai the night before last and went to take over yesterday morning in order to actively prepare for the scheduled opening.</p>
<p>Transfer Method. The personnel who went to receive the market yesterday included Chairman Du Yuesheng, Standing Directors Tingfang, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Fayao, Tang Chengzong, Resident Supervisor Xinzhi, General Manager Gan Xiaolai, Deputy Managers Zhu Kaiguan and Sun Guchen, Accountant Tang Zaizhang, Secretary Li Zizai, and more than ten others. Former Manager Jin Kaizhan invited them to lunch, then led them to inspect the auction hall, wharf, warehouse, cold storage, ice-making room, and other places. They then divided up to hand over the documents and contracts. Ministry of Finance Special Secretary Qian Maoxun supervised the inventory. Du Yuesheng and others left first, while Wang Xiaolai and others left around 4:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Business Philosophy. According to Wang Xiaolai, in an interview with a reporter from the Central News Agency, he went to Beijing twice to meet with Minister Wu to seek instructions on the market's organization and other matters. The fish market is an emerging industry in our country, and since all methods have been changed, the assistance of specialized personnel is required to handle it. The personnel previously dispatched by the Ministry are experts in fisheries, so they will still be relied upon. In terms of personnel, careful consideration will be given. All expenses will also be minimized. Minister Wu greatly appreciated this intention. He also discussed in detail how to reduce commissions to ease the burden on producers and consumers, strive for cleanliness and hygiene of products, provide economic assistance to fishermen to encourage fishing and increase production, so that consumers can obtain inexpensive necessities, and how to deal with the existing fish merchants at the Sixteenth Wharf to ensure they cooperate with the market and do not suffer losses. In short, the Ministry is committed to developing the fishing industry, and he will follow suit to promote its establishment.</p>
<p>Market Building. The fish market is located on the Jiangxinsha in Pudong and is magnificent and well-equipped. The entire building resembles a ship, with the broker's office in the rear, shaped like a semicircle. To the right are the water tower and cold storage. The construction of the walls and the installation of machinery were delayed, so it was completed last. The motors were tested recently, and the results were excellent. The cold storage equipment includes a freezing room with an area of 118.7 square meters and a volume of 392 cubic meters. It has two freezers and cooling pipes, which keep the temperature at -15 degrees Fahrenheit, with a cooling rate of 20,000 B.T.U. per hour. It can freeze 30.5 metric tons of fish in 24 hours. There are five cold storage rooms with a total area of 817.5 square meters and a volume of 2,699.3 cubic meters. The cooling pipes use a direct expansion system to maintain a constant temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit, with a cooling rate of 660,000 B.T.U. per hour. It can store 1,500 English tons of fish. The ice-making room has an area of 204.5 square meters and a volume of 965.2 cubic meters. Below it is a water pool with 672 ice containers, covered with wooden lids. Each container can freeze 300 pounds of ice. The daily ice production is 50 tons. Each room has cork-lined walls, with a thickness of 6 to 9 inches, and the doors are sealed with rubber to prevent heat transfer.</p>
<p>Total Construction Costs. The refrigeration for ice-making and cold storage uses an ammonia compression method. The machine room is equipped with two canopies and 5,000 bottles of ammonia to drive all the machines, with a total horsepower of 487. Four ammonia compressors, each powered by 100 horsepower, compress the ammonia liquid into the condenser to cool it and send it to each part, using the heat absorption effect during its expansion to freeze the ice and generate cold air. The water used is drawn from two deep wells, each reaching 550 feet. The power of 10 horsepower is also used to pump water into the storage tank, and after precipitation, it is pumped into the water tower, which has a capacity of 100 tons, to supply drinking water and ice-making for the entire venue. All electricity is supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, with each machine using 82 degrees of electricity per hour. The entire machine project was undertaken by the Dick Machine Factory at a cost of 350,000 yuan. Including the wharf construction cost of 100,000 yuan, the building construction cost of 280,000 yuan, and the equipment costs for the tracks in the venue, the total cost is 800,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sugar Merchants Affected by Smuggling in North China; National Sugar Enters a Desperate Situation</h3>
<p>All Sixteen Sugar Firms in the City Have Suspended Operations; Accumulated Inventory and Few Sales Pose a Risk of Stagnation; Sugar Merchants Telegraph the Ministry of Finance and Various Provinces Seeking Relief</p>
<p>According to the Dihua News Agency, in recent years, the sugar industry in our country has shown significant improvement. In the past, most of the sugar consumed by Chinese people was foreign sugar. In recent years, sugarcane has been widely planted in Guangdong Province, and the output has greatly increased. Therefore, the sales of domestic sugar have surpassed those of foreign sugar. The general management office for sales is located in Shanghai. All domestic and foreign sugar is transferred to various provinces in Central and North China via Shanghai. Therefore, the sales of foreign sugar in Shanghai are almost nationwide. All provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hebei, Hubei, Henan, Hunan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi purchase from Shanghai. Therefore, Shanghai is a key transportation hub for the sugar industry, and the annual business volume is also very large, with annual sales of 5 million dan, which, calculated at the current price of 22 yuan per dan, can reach 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>Smuggled Sugar Dumping; Domestic Sugar Disappears</p>
<p>Since last year, the smuggling at the customs in North China has greatly affected our country's sugar industry. Since the first, second, and third months of this year, the large-scale smuggling by Japanese ronin, especially of sugar, has further damaged the domestic sugar industry. Because smuggled sugar has low costs, the selling price is very low, only 15 or 16 yuan per dan. The selling price of domestic sugar is about 22 yuan. As a result, smuggled sugar can be sold smoothly. Initially, it was only in the Tianjin area, but it spread to Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hebei, and other provinces, and then penetrated into Anhui, Henan, Hunan, and other provinces. Recently, even Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have been flooded with smuggled sugar. Domestic sugar has become increasingly unpopular.</p>
<p>Various Provinces in the Interior Suffer the Same Fate</p>
<p>According to Xue Meiting of the city's Sugar Industry Association, all provinces in the interior are now dominated by smuggled sugar. The cost price of this type of sugar is quite balanced, with little fluctuation. At most, it only differs by two or three jiao per dan. If we pay taxes according to regulations, the cost will be more than 20 yuan, making it impossible to lower the price to compete with the 15 or 16 yuan smuggled sugar. As a result, Chinese sugar merchants are suffering terribly. Currently, merchants in various provinces find foreign sugar more profitable. Even those who deal in foreign cloth are now switching to the sugar business. The general invasion of smuggled sugar is evident. Ordinary sugar merchants want to purchase formally sourced sugar, but fear being outcompeted by low-priced smuggled sugar, so they have no choice but to switch to purchasing smuggled sugar. As a result, the provinces no longer deal in domestic sugar.</p>
<p>Damage Reaches Millions</p>
<p>According to the current situation, all 62 sugar firms in the city have suspended operations. Sales are non-existent, business is sluggish, and everyone is in dire straits and on the verge of collapse. The sugar business in the city in the previous month and the month before that only reached 10,000 packages, worth only about 200,000 yuan. If we follow the example of annual business reaching 100 million yuan, then even though these few days are slow days, the sluggishness of the business is evident. Currently, domestic sugar is piled up at the Jinliyuan Wharf, Gonghexiang Wharf, and other places, and there is no way to clear it out.</p>
<p>Telegraph to Authorities Urging Relief</p>
<p>Chinese merchants throughout the city believe that if this continues, the risk of business closure is imminent. Therefore, they telegraphed the Ministry of Finance a few days ago to quickly discuss effective measures, but it is difficult to start. The Sugar Industry Association is currently drafting a telegram to the Finance Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, requesting that a special consumption tax be levied on smuggled sugar to make its selling price similar to that of non-smuggled sugar in order to help formal sugar merchants. However, the outcome is difficult to predict. It is hoped that the authorities will quickly formulate fundamental remedies.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factory Association Participates in Zhejiang-Jiangxi Special Exhibition; Yesterday Notified Factories to Begin Registration</h3>

<h3>Annual Meeting of the British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association: Encouraging British Commercial Activities and Commenting on Chinese Politics</h3>
<p>The Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association branch in China held their 21st annual meeting at the Shanghai Club at 5:15 PM on Thursday, the 16th. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. In addition to members, attendees included Sir Brenan, British Consul-General in Shanghai and Honorary President of the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Peel, Commercial Counsellor of the British Embassy, Mr. Hude Hai, Chairman of the China Association, Mr. Ma Sai, Vice Chairman, and other prominent figures. First, Mr. Marshall read the annual report of the Chamber of Commerce, which was quite lengthy. It began with condolences on the passing of King George V of England, expressing confidence that the new monarch, Edward VII, would inherit his predecessor's ambitions. Then, it discussed the political situation in China last year and the impact of the political upheaval in North China, praising Generalissimo Chiang's efforts in suppressing the communists and hoping for an early unification of the North and South. It stated that in 1935, no major internal political unrest disrupted commerce, and therefore, the decline in commerce that year was largely due to the efforts of foreigners, on the one hand, and the recall of silver and the instability in North China, on the other. It then mentioned the losses from the floods in the Yellow River and Yangtze River last summer, which amounted to 450 million yuan. It also stated that foreign trade in China last year decreased by 70 million yuan compared to 1934 and 462 million yuan compared to 1932. The total import and export trade was compared in a table in millions of yuan, as follows:</p>
<p>1933 1934 1935</p>
<p>Net Imports 1,345 1,030 919</p>
<p>Exports 612 535 576</p>
<p>Total 1,957 1,565 1,495</p>
<p>Trade Deficit 733 495 343</p>
<p>The decrease in trade volume was partly due to the increase in local manufactured goods, but also due to the lack of confidence caused by political instability and the aggression in North China. It then discussed the harmful effects of smuggling in the demilitarized zone of North China on Chinese and foreign commerce. It also mentioned the increase and decrease of various imported and exported goods. In 1935, the export of Chinese raw silk greatly increased, but this was due to the Japanese restrictions on purchases in the spring and summer of that year and the subsequent damage to autumn purchases. China cannot rely on this favorable situation for long and should strive to improve standards and breeding methods. Attention should also be paid to tea cultivation methods. Government promotion can greatly increase foreign demand for Chinese tea. It also stated that Britain's trade with China had fallen from third to fourth place, with the order being the United States, Japan, Germany, and Britain. However, if the British Empire, including Hong Kong, is included, it still ranks first, followed by the United States, then Japan, and then Germany. British merchants naturally regret that British import trade has fallen to fourth place, but the remedy is not something that British people in China can do. It depends on domestic manufacturers. Price and favorable credit terms are important factors in obtaining orders. Unless efforts are made to compete with other countries on price and terms, Britain's position is unlikely to improve. This is not to say to take unnecessary risks, but to say that when there is adequate assurance, the convenience of credit should be given careful consideration. It then mentioned that the adoption of the legal tender and the stabilization of exchange rates were beneficial to merchants and export trade, and the new nickel and copper coins were welcomed by all parties. If the stability of the legal tender can be maintained for a long time, and standard new coins can be issued steadily, it can greatly contribute to the prosperity of commerce. It also mentioned the progress of Chinese industry in recent years, stating that heavy industry and public utilities requiring large amounts of capital should be operated by the authorities. However, some provincial and municipal governments are now engaged in light industry, which is not a good example, as it inhibits the development of private enterprise and creates monopolies. Government operation of such enterprises is harmful to the people and not beneficial. It then mentioned the achievements of Chinese railways and highways last year, stating that the overdue payments of Chinese railway loans are now being addressed, which will greatly facilitate future railway loans. It criticized the stamp tax law promulgated in China last year and other measures that hinder foreign commerce. It then mentioned the achievements of the National Economic Council last year in rural reconstruction, cooperative societies, agricultural development, and other undertakings, as well as the establishment of the Sino-British Trade Association. Finally, it summarized the entire report, stating that although commerce was in an unfavorable situation last year, much of the situation in North China, the so-called autonomous movement, and smuggling in the demilitarized zone were beyond the control of the Chinese authorities. Despite these unfavorable conditions, China's achievements in many areas were still remarkable. Without the instability caused by the northern forces, the future would be promising. However, given the current situation, the future is not yet optimistic. The report then listed the work of the Chamber of Commerce during the year. After the report, Sir Brenan and Mr. Peel delivered speeches. Mr. Peel said that British commerce is now on the road to recovery. He expects China to enter an era of importation and development, its currency management is gradually becoming stable, and its industrial revitalization is progressing in an orderly manner without being hasty, which is commendable. British merchants are prepared and willing to help China's future commercial progress, as in the past. The meeting then approved the accounts for the year and elected twelve new and old directors. Then, the meeting of the China Association was convened, and Chairman Hude Hai read the report, which stated that major issues between China and Britain, such as consular jurisdiction and the recovery of concessions, have been stalled since the end of 1931. However, one day these issues will be raised again, and the British should pay constant attention to the fact that when they are raised again in the future, the British Foreign Office and the British Embassy should allow the opinions of the British community in Shanghai to have adequate participation. The main task of the two associations in peacetime should be to jointly resist the continuous attempts to discriminate against foreign interests. The report cited the continued acceptance of the International Savings Society by the Chinese authorities as evidence of discrimination against foreign interests. It went on to say that the various laws enacted in recent years, such as the Encouragement of Industry Law, the Insurance Law, and the Private Railway Law, all directly discriminate against foreign interests and are contrary to the Chinese authorities' desire to encourage foreign investment. It then discussed the stamp tax, business tax, and other taxes, saying that on the surface, they were adopted in accordance with Western principles and, with the approval of the treaty powers, could be easily applied to foreigners. However, these laws cannot be applied to Chinese people, because local authorities in various provinces still enact their own laws, which run parallel to the laws promulgated by the central government. There are many troubles with taxes on taxes, which make it impossible for many foreign businesses to operate. We do not want to argue with the Chinese government's efforts to reform the laws. The only safe principle to be followed is the one stated in Chamberlain's note of January 1927, that the British government is prepared to have the British community in China pay legitimate taxes, that is, taxes paid by all Chinese citizens alike. This principle cannot be limited to taxes, but should also be applied to factory laws and the like, so as to avoid differences in treatment between Chinese and foreigners. In recent years, China's credit has made it difficult to make progress, but there are still many debts that are overdue. The resulting bad impression cannot be eliminated by excluding foreign businesses in China. The two associations cannot ignore the various situations mentioned above, and only cooperation, not discrimination, can greatly benefit China's interests and the interests of British merchants and investors in China. After the report, the association approved the accounts for the year and elected three new directors, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Four Radio Stations Are Being Built, Materials Have Been Shipped from England and Distributed to Various Locations for Installation</h3>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the long-distance telephone network connecting the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan, was planned by the Long-Distance Telephone Administration of the Ministry of Communications in January 1934. Five main lines were designated: Nanjing to Hankou, Nanjing to Tianjin, Xuzhou to Zhengzhou, Hankou to Changsha, and Jinan to Qingdao. The completed sections include (Jinghan Line) Nanjing to Shun'an, Hukou, Yangxin, Jinghan Branch Line, Yinjiahui, Shun'an to Anqing, (Jingjin Line) Nanjing to Xuzhou, Xuzhou to Jinan, (Hanxiang Line) Hankou to Changsha, Xuzhou to Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. The sections under construction include (Jingjin Line) Jinan to Tianjin, Tianjin to Beijing Branch Line, and (Jiqing Line) Jinan to Qingdao and various counties.</p>
<p>Building Radio Stations</p>
<p>In order to make the sound of long-distance calls clear across the country, boost radio wave power, and prevent the impact of hurricanes and rain, the Ministry of Communications is building radio stations in Shanghai, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places. The materials are ordered from the British Standard Electric Company by the Ministry of Communications' electrical materials supply department, costing more than 200,000 yuan. The materials have now been shipped from England to Shanghai and transferred to the Nanjing National Long-Distance Telephone Administration Bureau for distribution to various locations for installation. The radio station in Shanghai will be attached to the long-distance telephone station on Yongxing Road in Zhabei.</p>
<p>Telephone Service in June</p>
<p>In recent years, after the Ministry of Communications ordered the telephone bureaus in various provinces and cities to work hard on telephone construction, the national telephone area has reached more than 600 locations. In addition to the telegraph and telephone lines, the total length of the telephone lines, including the newly built long-distance telephone lines in nine provinces, is more than 9,200 kilometers. Transportation is becoming more and more convenient, and the business is developing more and more, almost replacing telegrams. The long-distance telephone project across the nine provinces has been delayed due to weather conditions and will be completed by the end of next month. The completed sections are currently being tested separately, and it is expected that the telephone service will be open in early June of this year. At that time, the Ministry of Communications will hold a grand telephone ceremony in Beijing, and the Minister of Communications will report on the construction process.</p>
<h3>The Special District Rickshaw Association Asks to Increase the Number of Registered Rickshaw Pullers, Sending Letters to the Municipal Council and Requesting Assistance from the Chinese Directors, and Issuing Notices to Rickshaw Owners to Resolve to Persevere to the End</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Special District Rickshaw Association sent letters to the Municipal Council and the Chinese Directors yesterday regarding the registration of rickshaw pullers by the Municipal Council and issued notices to rickshaw owners. The following is a record:</p>
<p>Letter to the Municipal Council The Special District Rickshaw Association previously sent a letter to the Municipal Council, expressing its unwillingness to pay the mutual aid fee and its dissatisfaction with the mutual aid society, considering the mutual aid society to be a business of the Municipal Council. The issue of its existence or abolition should be decided by rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers. However, the Municipal Council's reply did not mention the mutual aid fee. Therefore, yesterday, lawyer Gu Wo sent a letter to the Municipal Council, requesting a meeting of rickshaw merchant representatives to resolve all outstanding issues. The original text reads, "We have just received your letter of the 9th of this month and have already informed our clients. Our clients express deep regret over the rickshaw puller disturbances and declare that they have absolutely no involvement in the disturbances. Our clients received a letter from the Rickshaw Affairs Committee on the 7th of this month and immediately published it in the newspaper on Sunday to inform all rickshaw owners that rickshaw puller registration will continue from the 14th of this month. However, because the Rickshaw Committee only stipulates an increase of 5,000 rickshaw puller registrations, the number is very small. Our clients have long believed that the number of rickshaw pullers needed for the rickshaw industry is insufficient, and it is difficult to allocate a small number of registrations to a large number of rickshaw pullers who have not been registered. Your council's letter of the 9th stated that the Rickshaw Committee has been authorized to issue rickshaw puller registration certificates sufficient for the needs of the rickshaw industry. However, the rickshaw pullers demanded registration yesterday and caused disturbances, which is obviously because the Rickshaw Committee is unwilling to issue rickshaw puller registration certificates sufficient for the needs of the rickshaw industry. The Rickshaw Committee has not yet clearly stipulated the number of rickshaw pullers who should be registered to meet the needs of the rickshaw industry or obtained a definite number agreed to by the Rickshaw Merchants' Association. In order to avoid further disturbances by rickshaw pullers, our clients hope that the matters mentioned in the two letters of the 26th and 30th of last month, which were not mentioned in your council's reply of the 9th of this month, namely the collection of mutual aid fees and the issue of the existence or abolition of the mutual aid society, should be resolved as soon as possible by convening a joint meeting of rickshaw merchant representatives and your council representatives. In accordance with the intentions expressed in the unresolved paragraphs of your council's letter, our clients are very willing to have an opportunity to personally present everything to your council."</p>
<p>Letter to the Chinese Directors The association sent a letter to the Chinese directors, saying, "We respectfully inform you that upon reading the newspapers, we learned that Mr. has been re-elected as a Chinese director in the 15th Delegates' Meeting of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession, which shows that he enjoys popular support and the enthusiasm of the citizens of the city in unanimously supporting him. We are deeply impressed. In recent years, the rickshaw disputes in the Public Concession have been caused by a part of the foreigners who want to eliminate rickshaws in order to realize the monopoly of foreign-run transportation businesses. Since the establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, which represents this kind of economic aggression, a year has passed, and it has been picking on the rickshaw industry in every possible way, exhausting its ability to demand perfection. Therefore, the rickshaw industry has plummeted in the past two years and is becoming increasingly precarious, and the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers have also suffered a great blow. For example, on April 14, the restriction of registration for unemployed rickshaw pullers by the Rickshaw Committee led to a conflict and bloodshed incident, which is very painful to say. It is understood that there are 10,000 rickshaws and 70,000 to 80,000 rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession. Since the Rickshaw Committee registered more than 41,000 rickshaw pullers in the previous year, there are as many as 30,000 to 40,000 rickshaw pullers who are unemployed because they are not registered and cannot pull rickshaws. Considering the livelihood of the poor, our association has repeatedly requested the Municipal Council to continue registration to save tens of thousands of unemployed people. Fortunately, we were invited to allow the registration to continue from April 14. Unexpectedly, the Rickshaw Committee temporarily announced that it would restrict one person to be introduced for every two rickshaws, with a total of 5,000 people. There is not enough porridge for everyone, which caused a conflict between rickshaw pullers and patrols. It is a deep regret. Since the purpose of rickshaw puller registration is to protect rickshaw pullers, it should be registered as much as possible according to the actual needs to avoid regrets. However, the Rickshaw Committee ignores the facts and restricts 5,000 people, so that most rickshaw pullers are still unemployed because they cannot register. This kind of action is tantamount to cutting off the livelihood of rickshaw pullers, which is inappropriate in terms of both emotion and reason. We have always admired Mr.'s enthusiasm for safeguarding Chinese commerce and caring for the livelihoods of the poor. We respectfully request that you strive for unrestricted rickshaw puller registration at the current board of directors' meeting so that tens of thousands of unemployed rickshaw pullers can maintain their lives. We rely entirely on Mr.'s contribution. We are eagerly awaiting your response."</p>
<p>Notice to Rickshaw Owners The industry association issued a notice to all rickshaw owners yesterday, saying, "To all rickshaw owners, the rickshaw industry is unfortunate and has been repeatedly ravaged. The reduction of rickshaw rent, the mandatory replacement of rickshaw styles, the implementation of rickshaw puller registration, and the payment of mutual aid fees are all enough to bankrupt our rickshaw industry. Although we rickshaw merchants initially compromised for the sake of peace and endured insults, we can never satisfy the insatiable ambitions of economic aggressors. In the past two years, the business of rickshaw merchants has plummeted, and the livelihoods of rickshaw pullers are in imminent danger. It is very painful to say. We read in the newspapers that in the speech by Arnold, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, at the annual meeting of the Western Ratepayers' Association on April 15, the foreigners' ambition to eliminate rickshaws was completely exposed. All the issues of reducing rickshaw rents and registering rickshaw pullers are transitional issues. Its ultimate goal is to fundamentally eliminate rickshaws in order to realize the monopoly of foreign-run buses and trams. Such ambition is appalling. At this critical juncture of life and death, in order to seek the survival of the rickshaw industry, we must rely on the unity of all rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers to jointly resist foreign aggression. If there is a lack of solidarity and small gains are seen while ignoring the big picture, then we can only bring about our own destruction. It will be too late to regret it at that time. Therefore, we sincerely inform you that all our rickshaw owners must unite with the greatest determination and spirit, act in unison, and share life and death. Then, there may be a glimmer of hope for the future of the rickshaw industry. This is a heartfelt and loyal message. We hope you will understand."</p>

<h3>The Husband and Wife Encounter a Mishap</h3>
<p>Zhou Keming, a 34-year-old from Fenghua, lives at 1407 Luzon Road in this city. In his early years, he married a woman named Sun from the same town. The couple has always been extremely harmonious. However, because Zhou was doing business in Harbin, he did not return home for several years. This time, he has been away from home for more than two years since the winter of 1934. Unexpectedly, Sun's abdomen has recently been swelling. After a doctor's examination, it was said that she was four months pregnant. At that time, a carpenter named Zou Asheng happened to be present in the doctor's office. Zou was Sun's neighbor and was usually a busybody. Hearing the news that the empty house had suddenly become pregnant after two years, he spread the news everywhere, which eventually reached Zhou's ears. Zhou was usually impatient and, without asking the details, immediately accused Sun of infidelity in a letter. Sun, at this moment of unexpected good fortune, was looking forward to his return when she suddenly received this letter and was overwhelmed with grief. Fortunately, after Sun's cousin, Sun Shiyao, accompanied her to Dr. Wang Longxiang for a detailed diagnosis, it was determined that Sun was weak and depressed and had amenorrhea. She then purchased "Yuè Yuè Hóng" and "Female Treasure" from a large pharmacy and took them according to the instructions on the package insert. Now, she has indeed had her period, and her body has recovered. It is said that Zhou arrived in Shanghai yesterday, intending to investigate the affair and prepare to file for divorce. However, after being told the truth by others, he is now relieved and free of suspicion, and they are as loving as ever.</p>

<h3>Fragrance Industry Workers Went on Strike Yesterday Morning - To Support Workers at the Dayuan Ship Fragrance Factory</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News, the Dayuan Ship Fragrance Factory in the British Concession on Hualei Road recently experienced sluggish business. The originally stipulated wage for resuming work was reduced from $0.521 to $0.48 per day with the consent of the workers. However, the factory recently reduced the wage again to $0.40 per day, causing dissatisfaction among the workers, who requested assistance from the Shanghai Fragrance Industry Workers Union. After the union's negotiations, no results were achieved. All the workers in the industry went on strike yesterday in response. Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, a general meeting of all members was held at the union hall, attended by over 350 people.

<h3>Winner of the 21st Aviation Lottery - Xu Fu from Shanghai Wins 10,000 Yuan - Sales of Each Lottery Issue Have Been Very Strong</h3>
<p>Since the National Government's Aviation Highway Lottery was launched, it has reached the 21st issue. Due to its well-established credibility, each issue has been sold out. Because this lottery contributes to construction and offers prizes, people are naturally eager to purchase it. The 21st issue has already been released, and sales are very strong.

<h3>Impersonating Water and Electricity Company Employees - Stealing Electricity Meters and Arrested - Sun Yonglin Repeatedly Fraudulent</h3>
<p>The house of He Xiuchun, a local resident at No. 16 Jia, Zhoujiazhai, Shuider Road, Zhabei, was visited by a craftsman-like person at about 9 AM yesterday morning. The person claimed that the electrical meter in their home was damaged and that the company had sent them to remove it and replace it with a new meter. The person then removed a Siemens-brand electrical meter from the wall and attempted to leave with it. However, his flustered demeanor aroused suspicion. He was reported secretly to the Qujiaqiao Police Station, who dispatched officers to apprehend him along with the electrical meter, a folding ruler, and two awls. A telephone inquiry was made to the Water and Electricity Company, who stated that they had not dispatched anyone to remove electrical meters. The suspect confessed that his name was Sun Yonglin, from Suzhou, 25 years old. Due to unemployment and poverty, he resorted to this tactic. He had previously stolen an electrical meter from a Mr. or Ms. Jiang's home in Jiangwan and sold it for cash. The police station considered the case to be one of fraud and extremely despicable. A document was prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Zhan Dayou's Property Dispute - Zhan Yunshan and Others Convicted of Forging Documents</h3>
<p>Zhan Daoyou, the owner of the Zhan Dayou Farm, had only one daughter, who married Zha Qilin. Zhan Daoyou passed away in 1929, leaving behind over two million yuan in property. However, his daughter, Zha Zhan, also died. Zha Zhan had two sons and one daughter, who inherited their maternal grandfather's estate in succession, with Zha Qilin as their guardian. Zhan Yunsan and Zhan Songsan, Zhan Daoyou's younger brothers, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the District Court against Zha Qilin, requesting an audit. They then filed a lawsuit claiming inheritance, alleging that Daoyou had adopted Yunsan's son as his son and produced a certificate of adoption and a will allegedly written by Zhan Daoyou. They also brought Daoyou's nephew, Yu Ruizhi, to court as a witness to verify the document. Zha Qilin claimed that the documents were forged. The judge submitted them for authentication, and they were indeed found to be forged. They were reported to the prosecutor, who filed a public prosecution. After repeated trials and arguments, Judge Cai announced the verdict yesterday. Zhan Yunsan and Zhan Songsan were jointly sentenced to four months of imprisonment for using forged private documents.

<h3>Grain Council Plan: Building New-Style Granaries to Store Grain</h3>
<h3>Exemption of Full Tax on Imported Broken Rice Requested; Ningbo Chamber of Commerce Changes Plan to Purchase Imported Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Mr. Gu Xin-yi, a leader in the grain industry, to inquire about various grain-related matters. Mr. Gu provided the following information:</p>
<p>**Cessation of Imported Rice Orders**</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grain Council, through its 43rd regular meeting, resolved to request the Social Affairs Bureau to forward a request to the Municipal Government for an appropriation of 200,000 yuan to order 100,000 bags of imported rice. The remaining funds were to be secured upon arrival of the rice. Simultaneously, it requested the Ministry of Finance to issue a tax exemption permit. However, due to the Municipal Government's financial difficulties, no funds were available. Moreover, although Shanghai experienced a grain shortage during this pre-harvest period, it was not expected to become a major problem. Therefore, the proposal to order imported rice has been discontinued.</p>
<p>**Plan to Build New-Style Granaries**</p>
<p>Regarding the Duojialu base of the original Shanghai grain storage funds and properties rented by Shanghai hospitals, it was resolved to request the Social Affairs Bureau to forward a reasoned argument to the Municipal Government, insisting that grain storage funds and properties should not be used for other purposes in accordance with central government directives. Furthermore, it requested the Municipal Government to allocate funds to build new-style granaries on the original site to handle grain storage matters. Implementation measures have now been determined, and construction is planned to reserve grain.</p>
<p>**Exemption of Increased Tax on Broken Rice Requested**</p>
<p>Since the Customs announcement on April 11th to levy full tax on broken rice, grain merchants had ordered a total of over 100,000 bags of broken rice before April 11th that had not yet been imported. The guild has resolved through a meeting to send a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance Customs Administration, requesting that broken rice traded before April 11th still be taxed at half the rate. However, since the full tax was levied, grain merchants have no longer ordered imported broken rice.</p>
<p>**Ningbo Changes Plan to Purchase Imported Rice**</p>
<p>Previously, the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, in view of the approximately 300,000 shi shortage of rice in the area this year, borrowed 3 million yuan from the Farmers Bank of China to order 300,000 bags of imported rice and requested the Executive Yuan to issue a free permit. Now, the original plan has been changed to order 40,000 to 50,000 bags of imported broken rice, which has already been traded and will arrive in China successively. This broken rice was ordered before April 11th, and they are currently requesting exemption from full tax upon import.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Conflict with Police: Lost Handgun Recovered, Hidden in Rickshaw Puller Qian Fu-sheng's Bedroom; Police Charge with Robbery and Grievous Bodily Harm</h3>
<p>Between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM on the 14th of this month, a conflict occurred between rickshaw pullers and police officers in the area of McTyeire Road and Shunde Road due to rickshaw registration. At the time, in addition to Chinese Deputy Head Constable Tao Shi-wei being injured, Chinese Constable No. 1853 was also seriously injured, and a handgun with six bullets that he was carrying was stolen. Although the police subsequently arrested many rioters and sent them to the court for interrogation and detention, the person who actually robbed the gun and bullets had not been captured. Therefore, in recent days, the police authorities have paid close attention to this case and ordered all police stations to investigate strictly. On the morning of the day before yesterday at about 1:00 AM, Chinese detectives Zhou Hong-lin and Qian Xian-ting of the Public Concession Police Headquarters learned that the suspect in the handgun robbery case was hiding at No. 10 Chongde Lane, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. They reported this to Inspector Lu Lian-kui, who ordered Detective Song Bing-zheng and Western Detective White to go to the address together with detectives from the Zhabei Public Security Bureau. They found that No. 10 Chongde Lane was a rickshaw repair company. The kitchen shed was the bedroom of Qian Fu-sheng, a rickshaw puller from Ningbo. They searched the room and found the stolen handgun and six bullets of Chinese Constable No. 1853 on a broken rickshaw, covered with Qian Fu-sheng's clothes. They arrested Qian Fu-sheng and questioned him about the origin of the handgun, but he claimed he didn't know and needed to ask Zhu San. The detectives then apprehended Zhu San (i.e., Zhu Shou-fu), who also gave evasive answers and refused to speak clearly. They were both taken to the Public Security Bureau and then transferred to the Xinza Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Zhang Tian-yin sent them to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, charging them with robbery and grievous bodily harm under Article 328, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law. He also recounted the previous events, saying that the injured victim, Chinese Constable No. 1853, was seriously injured, with severe eye damage, and was still being treated in the hospital. Therefore, he requested an extension. Qian Fu-sheng and Zhu Shou-fu both claimed that they did not know who had placed the handgun on the rickshaw. After Judge Tan Xin-zhen verified the confession, he ordered the two defendants to be detained pending a further hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Sudden Gale in the City Yesterday; Cloudy Sky and Cooler Weather; Rain Intermittent After Wind Stopped in Afternoon</h3>
<p>The weather in the city has been quite hot recently, especially on the day before yesterday (the 16th). Residents are mostly dressed in light clothing, and even laborers working with bare arms are sweating profusely. Unexpectedly, after nightfall, a gust of wind suddenly rose, howling all night. Yesterday morning, the wind intensified, and eaves tiles were often blown down. Pedestrians on the thoroughfares had their hats easily blown off by the wind, so they all hurried along with their heads covered. After 9:00 AM, the sunlight suddenly disappeared, and the weather also turned cooler. In the afternoon, the wind subsided slightly, but rain was intermittent, continuing until nightfall.</p>
<h3>Coal Industry Attention: Another New Coal Firm Lawsuit; Over a Hundred People Attended Hearing Yesterday; Guild Secretary Recounts Handling of Stolen Coal; New Coal Admits Coal Purchased from Mitsui</h3>
<p>The Liu Jiang Coal Mine in Hebei Province has been seized by force, and negotiations for its return have been unsuccessful for a long time. The Liu Jiang Coal Mine Company reported this to the Shanghai Coal Industry Guild, which resolved to refuse to sell Liu Jiang coal; violators would have their membership in the Coal Industry Guild revoked and face economic sanctions. Zhang Yan-zhang, the owner of the New Coal Firm, a Ningbo native and currently a supervisory committee member of the Coal Industry Guild, also supported the above resolution when it was passed. However, he later went back on his word and was the first to violate the resolution by purchasing a large quantity of Liu Jiang coal and dumping it at a low price. The Liu Jiang Company then claimed that he was selling stolen coal and requested the Coal Industry Guild to implement sanctions based on the resolution. Zhang Yan-zhang then filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Local Court against Shen Jin-zhou, the manager of Liu Jiang, for obstructing credit. The case has been heard twice, as reported in previous newspapers. Currently, Zhang Yan-zhang has successively filed petitions requesting that Liu Hong-sheng, Chen Yu-tang, Wei Hong-wen, Mao Chun-pu, Pan Yi-san, and five others be added as defendants in the case. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Sheng-chao continued the hearing. The defendant was still only Shen Jin-zhou, who appeared in court. However, over a hundred people from the coal industry attended the hearing, making the Fifth Court crowded. The summoned witness, Wang Ping-nan, the secretary of the Coal Industry Guild, recounted the guild's handling of the matter, saying that Zhang was a supervisory committee member and Shen was an executive committee member. After Liu Jiang requested assistance, the guild held several executive committee or executive and supervisory committee joint meetings before resolving the sanctions against those who sold Liu Jiang coal. Zhang also stated at the meetings that anyone who sold Liu Jiang coal should be expelled from the guild. Unexpectedly, Zhang's New Coal Firm actually sold it, disguising it as Hebei coal. He then submitted all the relevant documents and drafts to the court for review. Zhang Yan-zhang testified that the coal was purchased from Mitsui, and Mitsui purchased it from Tai Kee Company. Tai Kee is one of the three major coal mines in Qinhuangdao. The defendant claimed it was stolen coal and should provide proof. Shen Jin-zhou stated that Tai Kee never ships coal to Shanghai, as all industry members know. The only coal from Qinhuangdao is Liu Jiang coal. The plaintiff's lawyer then requested to question the defendant about his lawsuit in eastern Hebei. The defendant's lawyer said that there was a puppet government in eastern Hebei, and it was painful to talk about it, so he did not elaborate. The court has ordered a further hearing next Friday afternoon. Suddenly, a voice came from the crowd of listeners, clamoring in response. The bailiffs and court police stopped it and ordered the audience to leave, and the order was fortunately not disrupted, but several Chinese and Western bailiffs and police officers had already gathered after hearing the sound, then all the idlers in the court dispersed.</p>
<h3>Post Office Promotes Registered Express Delivery</h3>
<p>In the past, the express mail service offered by post offices across China only included "registered express delivery," which was handled at designated post offices. In order to facilitate the public, the Ministry of Communications added "ordinary express mail" last year, which can be sent and received everywhere. It is now learned that the Directorate General of Posts is taking a further step to promote registered express delivery again. Except for Mongolia and Xinjiang, it can be delivered to any location without restrictions. When the post office sends it, it is delivered via the fastest route. After it arrives, it is also delivered using the fastest method, even if it is submitted after the ordinary mail dispatch time, it will be sent out as quickly as possible within the possible range. The plan has been ordered by the Directorate General of Posts to all post offices nationwide and will be implemented uniformly from May 1st.</p>
<h3>Shanghai International Settlement Volunteers to Hold Inspection Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps of the Public Concession, as usual, holds a general inspection once a year. This year's general inspection is scheduled to be held today at 3:30 PM. All units of the Volunteer Corps, except for the mechanized unit, will gather at the Racecourse at 3:00 PM.

After this, the infantry and cavalry units will turn from Rue du Consulat into Route Tenant de la Tour, and return to the Racecourse via Weihaiwei Road. The mechanized unit will return to the Volunteer Corps Training Room via Avenue Haig, Avenue Foch, Avenue Edward VII, and Tibet Road, turning into Hankou Road.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Native Association Sends Letter to Customs to Punish Culprit, Provide Generous Compensation to Lou A-he</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Commissioner, stating: "Respectfully, according to a letter from our member Ying Sun-chuan, our fellow townsman Lou A-he, 41 years old, from Duji Village, Jinxiang Township, Dinghai, had been engaged in fishing. Last winter, on December 18th of the lunar calendar, he sold fish from the Zhu A-bao winter sandfish boat in Dinghai. On the morning of the 19th, when sailing to the waters off Zhushanmen, they were chased by Shanghai patrol boat No. 25. Fearing a misunderstanding, they immediately lowered the sails to await inspection. Unexpectedly, foreign and Chinese personnel on the patrol boat opened fire continuously, and bullets hit Lou A-he in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground immediately. Only then did the foreigner realize that the shooting was inappropriate. They accompanied Lou A-he and the boat owner Zhu A-bao to the Dinghai Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of the injuries, the Dinghai Hospital was unable to help. On the same day, patrol boat No. 25 transported him to the Ningbo Huamei Hospital. He eventually died at 3:00 PM on the 20th at Huamei Hospital due to his injuries. The Ningbo Customs purchased a coffin for him, and the Ningbo Customs Commissioner issued 20 yuan for travel expenses, which was received by Lou A-he's wife, Chen, and was verbally instructed to send a telegram to Jianghai Customs to request compensation. It has been more than a month since Lou A-he was killed, and compensation has not yet been issued. Regardless of whether the Ningbo Customs Commissioner fulfills his promise, it is justified that the patrol boat mistakenly injured the fisherman. Lou A-he's funeral was desolate, leaving behind a widow and orphan, making their livelihood extremely difficult. As our association is closer to the victim, we know the details thoroughly. Therefore, we provide a brief account of the incident and request that you find a way to negotiate and seek compensation for the victim to appease his spirit. We also hope to receive a reply." Addressed to the Jianghai Customs Commissioner.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhu-xuan's Opium Dross and White Powder Tested to Have Narcotic Toxicity; Custodial Dereliction Case to Continue Hearing Today</h3>
<p>Gu Zhu-xuan was arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court for instigating the assassination of Tang Jia-peng and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. During the appeal period, Gu bribed guards to instigate perjury, and the prosecutor filed a public prosecution for two closed hearings. At the same time, prison guard director Jia Fu-rong and detention center director Wu Lu were accused by inmates such as Li He-shang of colluding with Gu Zhu-xuan to smoke opium in the outer sick ward, and opium dross, white powder, and other items were confiscated. The prosecutor also investigated Jia and others for dereliction of duty. After a hearing last month, Jia Fu-rong was put under the charge of the prison warden, and Wu Lu was detained. The court sent the confiscated opium slices and white powder to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to test for toxicity. It is now learned that the forensic institute has completed the test and the results show that the white powder, opium dross, and other items do contain narcotic toxicity. The court received the report a few days ago and has scheduled the head of the criminal court, Wang Gang-xu, to continue the hearing on the dereliction of duty case at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Worthless Son-in-Law Opens Fire After Loan Request Denied; Wife and Mother-in-Law Both Injured</h3>
<p>Mrs. Tang Qi, a local woman, 56 years old, lives at No. 1 Tangjiazhai, Caojiadu. She has a daughter named Yinzhu, currently 36 years old, who married Shen A-di, a local man, through a matchmaker many years ago. Unexpectedly, A-di has no regular job and roams around all day, associating with local ruffians, acting like a hooligan, specializing in meddling, and extorting money whenever possible. Occasionally, when he is short of money, he goes to his mother-in-law's house to borrow money from Tang Qi. If he is not satisfied, he often curses and scolds, causing the Tang family to fear him like a tiger and hate him to the core. In the end, he still manages to borrow some money and leaves. Yesterday afternoon at around 7:00 PM, Shen A-di, under the pretext of visiting his wife Yinzhu, who had not returned from Ningbo, went to her house. Before long, A-di's old habits returned, and he again asked his mother-in-law for a loan. Tang Qi refused outright and offered some advice, hoping he would change his ways and strive for self-reliance. However, A-di took the good advice as an insult and became extremely angry, cursing and scolding. At that time, Yinzhu could not bear it and helped her mother to confront A-di. Unexpectedly, Shen A-di said nothing, rushed out of the door, and brought back four hooligans, rushing into the inner room, pulling out a handgun, and shooting Tang Qi and Yinzhu in the legs each, then fleeing together. By the time the patrol police arrived after being notified, both the mother and daughter were lying on the ground, covered in blood. They quickly hired a car to take them to the hospital for treatment, and then reported to the police station, sending officers out to pursue and arrest the perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Female Witch Arrested by Police</h3>
<p>Zhu Ji, a woman from Taicang, 38 years old, lives upstairs at No. 1 Rongshan Lane, Singapore Road, in western Shanghai. She works as a female witch (commonly known as a "spiritual medium"), relying on false claims of ghosts and spirits to deceive ignorant and foolish people, and takes the opportunity to extort money. Over the years, many people have been deceived by her. Recently, her activities have become even more harmful. After receiving a tip-off, Inspector Li of the Singapore Road Public Security Substation, together with Sergeant Fa Jin-zhang and Constable Zhang Ru-lan, went to the address at around 5:00 PM yesterday and arrested the woman and her husband, Zhu Chang-sheng, 46 years old, from Suzhou. They also found a box of incense ashes, two Buddhist idols, and six paper gods in the house and took them all to the station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Ring: Zhou Chun-bo's Son, a Young Hostage, in Pudong; French Police Dispatch Detectives to Consult with Public Security Bureau for Search; Maid Jin Zhou with Suspicion</h3>
<p>Zhou Chun-bo from Hubei, residing at No. 135 Bubbling Well Road, French Concession, has been working at a local exchange for years and has some assets. Zhou has two sons, the elder named Jie-sheng, only four years old, and the younger still an infant. On the 4th of this month, at around 1:00 PM, the maid Jin Zhou, a Shaoxing native (43 years old), who had been employed for six years, took the elder son Jie-sheng to play at the doorway. Suddenly, a strange car came, and several bandits jumped out, kidnapping Jin Zhou and Jie-sheng onto the car and speeding away. When the Zhou family learned of this, they urgently reported to the police, who dispatched detectives to pursue them, but they were already gone. The next day, the Zhou family received a letter delivered by the post office. After reading the contents, they were certain that it was sent by the bandits, only informing them that the hostage was safe, without setting a ransom. For over ten days since then, they have not received a second ransom demand. Yesterday afternoon, the Old Zha Police Station of the Public Concession arrested a bandit named Xu Ren-gui at a certain location, who confessed that his accomplices were hiding in a new bungalow at No. 12 Peide Lane, near Shiditang, West Yangjiazhai, Pudong. At 6:30 PM, detectives You A-gen and Lu Gen-sheng, along with Western Detective Bodé, of the police station took the criminal to the Pudong Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance in the apprehension. The bureau chief Zhang Ming-qin immediately dispatched over ten police officers to the location, surrounding it front and back. They immediately searched the room and discovered that the so-called hideout was actually a kidnapping ring. The hostage being held was Zhou Chun-bo's kidnapped elder son, Jie-sheng. Bandits Zhang Xi-biao (41 years old, Shaoxing native), Jin Feng-xiang (38 years old, Shaoxing native), Ma Liang-fu (34 years old, Shaoxing native), Wang Shi-pin (Shaoxing native), and woman Wang Xie (36 years old, Shaoxing native), girl Wang Xiang-zhen (18 years old, Shaoxing native), boy Wang Xiang-cao (13 years old, Shaoxing native), and seven other people were arrested. Zhou Chun-bo's maid, Jin Zhou, and the hostage Zhou Jie-sheng, were also in the house. A Mauser pistol with serial number 454142 and 17 bullets were also confiscated. All the people were taken to the Pudong Bureau for questioning. It was found that Zhou's maid, Jin Zhou, was from the same place as the bandits, and there was a strong suspicion of her involvement. The fingerprinted suspects were then taken to the police station by detectives Zhang Zi-ying and others of the French Concession police for disposal. The Pudong Bureau found that the house was rented by Xi and Wang from the landlord on the 8th of this month, and there was a guarantor. The police were sent to guard the house and reported to the superiors, awaiting instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Temple Incense Murder Case Involving Wang Hui-nong, Escorted to Suzhou for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Jing-xuan, the manager of a branch of a bank near the Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession, and Wang Hui-nong, the chief accountant, were previously arrested for colluding in embezzlement. The head office discovered the matter last year and reported it to the police. Chen and Wang were subsequently arrested and sent to the Second Special District Court, where they were sentenced separately. It is now learned that the second defendant, Wang Hui-nong, fled to a temple in Suzhou when the case broke out. Unfortunately, the temple's incense caretaker, someone named Jia, was murdered. The Wu County authorities arrested a related patrol officer, He Nai-kang, and sentenced him. Now, because He is dissatisfied, he has appealed to the High Court. Because the High Court believes that Wang Hui-nong is also an important witness in the case, it prepared a document and sent police to Shanghai to request the Third High Branch Court to transfer Wang for strict interrogation. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang from the Third High Branch Court presided over the trial of Wang Hui-nong in the Sixth Court and ordered the transfer of Wang to the police for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Enticing Another Man's Wife to Be His Concubine: Assault After Refusal; Ms. Xu Swallows Gold Due to Two Threats; Scoundrel Liu Si Flees Arrest</h3>
<p>Ms. Xu, 22 years old, wife of Tang Bao-lin, a resident of No. 18 Heshan Lane, Lujiabang Road, Nanshi, has been working at the Junlong Cloth Factory in Xieqiao. When passing by Dalin Road every day, she was often harassed by Liu Si, the owner of Jiecheng Company at No. 1 Shi'anfang, who wanted Ms. Xu to be his concubine. When Ms. Xu refused, Liu Si became angry and led several hooligans, including Gao Gui-sheng, to Ms. Xu's house yesterday, where they beat Ms. Xu's mother and Ms. Xu, and threatened that if there was no response tomorrow, they would take extreme measures. Later, through the mediation of Xu Jin-sheng, the incident was resolved, and the two sides no longer had any incidents. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 PM that afternoon, Liu Si and Gao Gui-sheng went to the Xu's house again, wanting Xu's husband, Tang Bao-lin, to come out and talk. When Tang was not home, Ms. Xu, seeing this, became worried and anxious, and swallowed two gold earrings in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was discovered, and Tang Xu was sent to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. The Sanguantang Police Station reported this to the Ximen Branch, which sent police to arrest Liu Si and Gao Gui-sheng, but they had already fled.

<h3>Expansion of the Second Branch of the High Court</h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court has expanded its premises. Due to the limited space of the original location, which was insufficient for its needs, the court purchased over ten rooms in the Xipuyi Lane adjacent to the court last winter. Since the buildings were not very old, they were slightly renovated. The renovation is now complete, and some staff members have moved into the new space to alleviate overcrowding. Previously, the Second Branch of the High Court only had one civil court and one criminal court. Now, the room in front of the First Court, which was formerly a lounge for lawyers, has been converted into a Third Court, and the room next to the Revenue and Expenditure Office has been vacated to serve as the lawyers' lounge. Currently, the Second Branch of the High Court has three courtrooms.

<h3>Sino-British International Billiards: Chinese Still Hold the Advantage. Results from the Second Day Show a Lead of 34 Points. Hu Changyuan Lost by 125 Points Yesterday.</h3>
<p>The results of the second day of competition in the Fourth Sino-British International Billiards Tournament show that the Chinese team still holds the advantage, leading by 34 points. The third match, Shen Lince versus Bockell, will be held next Monday (the 20th) at 5:30 PM. The competition for the championship is becoming increasingly intense, and the outcome depends on the result of the third match.</p>
<p>Fighting Hard Against a Strong Opponent: Yesterday, Hu Changyuan maintained a serious attitude and a determined will, battling the Englishman Clark for three hours. The number of points he lost was not as high as expected. He not only fulfilled his duty but also inspired the spirit of the Chinese team. From the ninth shot onwards, Hu had a cumulative lead, and by the thirtieth shot, the score was 144 to 125, giving him a lead of 19 points. Clark had a stroke of luck, scoring unexpected points and launching an offensive. Unfortunately, Hu inadvertently shot the ball out of bounds and had to stop. Otherwise, he would have won by more than just 27 points. Later, both sides competed on the central horizontal line, and by the forty-fourth shot, Hu Changyuan still had a one-point lead at 256 to 125.</p>
<p>Following the Rules: After the forty-fifth shot, Clark gradually improved, and his shots were on target. He scored two short scores of 32 and 37 in a row (the highest score of the day), resulting in a difference of over 80 points. In the end, he scored another 32 points, exceeding 100 points. Hu Changyuan used the strategy of clearing the field to resist his strong opponent, but due to Clark's all-around skills, he could only helplessly try to recover points. As a result, Hu Changyuan lost by 125 points with a score of 485 to 600. Clark's high scores were 27, 20, 32, 37, 32, and 21, while Hu Changyuan's were 20, 25, 22, 25, 24, and 27.</p>

<h3>Universities Enrolling New Students; Ministry of Education Issues Order for Restrictions; Next Year's Method Will Follow This Year's Method</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th dispatch) The Ministry of Education issued an order that for the 25th year, all universities and independent colleges enrolling new and transfer students will, unless otherwise stipulated by the Ministry for specific departments or colleges that have been ordered to suspend enrollment of new students within a limited time, continue to apply the enrollment methods of the 24th year. Key points: 1. All departments of arts, law, commerce, education, science, agriculture, medicine, and engineering in all universities and independent colleges should carefully examine the qualifications of teachers and equipment conditions of each department and determine the number of students to be enrolled in each department to ensure that teaching efficiency is actually achieved. There should be no excessive enrollment. 2. Universities with colleges of arts, law, commerce, and education, and independent colleges with departments of arts, law, commerce, and education, should limit the number of new and transfer students enrolled in each department or specialized course to 30, unless special circumstances such as outstanding academic performance have been specifically authorized by the Ministry before the enrollment. Universities with colleges of arts and science, or independent colleges with departments of arts and science, should also follow the provisions of this item for each department or specialized course belonging to arts, law, commerce, and education. Universities with colleges of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, or independent colleges with departments of science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, which have affiliated departments or specialized courses of arts, law, commerce, and education, should also follow the provisions of this item for their enrollment methods. 3. Schools that do not enroll students in accordance with these methods will not have the enrollment qualifications of their new and transfer students approved by the Ministry. 4. These regulations do not apply to colleges that specialize in female students for the time being.</p>

<h3>The Educational Inspection Report of Superintendent Zhou of Anhui Province's Education (1)</h3>
<p>According to the inspection report of Superintendent Zhou Bangdao, Anhui Province's education has many outstanding aspects, such as the unified control of the construction and equipment of provincial schools, the organization of the provincial education supplies consumer cooperative, the subsidizing of outstanding students from poor families, the establishment of local education supervisors, the implementation of the normal school guidance area, the exceeding of the original plan for the number of short-term primary schools established, the pilot implementation of the guidance student system and the teaching student system, and the rectification of training in private schools and secondary schools. However, there are still points that need to be improved, which are recorded below.</p>
<p>I. Regarding Compulsory Education:</p>
<p>Each county should appoint a chief of the joint guarantee within five to ten primary school districts as the school director of that school district. Due to the relationship between the position and authority of the chief of the joint guarantee, it is relatively easy to complete the tasks stipulated in Article 29 of the Implementation Rules of the Outline of the Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education. However, the qualifications, knowledge, sense of responsibility, and location of residence of the chief of the joint guarantee must be carefully considered before appointment, so that it is easy to be effective and not equal to a formality. If necessary, guidance or assistant personnel may be appointed in accordance with the provisions of the same article to guide or assist the school director in handling affairs. As the school director is originally an unpaid voluntary position, efforts should be made to encourage them spiritually to avoid neglecting the basic work of compulsory education due to the lack of material rewards.</p>
<p>The number of short-term primary school students in each county is relatively small. Setting up only one class per school is uneconomical and does not fully meet the original purpose of the central government's promotion of compulsory education. In the future, in addition to ordering the principals of each short-term primary school to strictly implement the "Methods for Enrolling and Retaining Students" in the "Short-Term Primary School Principal's Guide," the compulsory enrollment methods that have been announced should be strictly enforced to achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Administrative personnel in charge of compulsory education in each county should formulate performance appraisal methods, conduct detailed assessments, and strictly impose rewards and punishments.</p>
<p>The methods of the Xuan City Short-Term Primary School Award Association and the Wuhu special short-term primary school teacher substitute class method are of great help to the promotion of compulsory education and should be followed in each county within a possible range.</p>
<p>The number of short-term primary school teachers in the province is quite lacking. The short-term primary school teacher training class should be organized as soon as possible in accordance with the 25th year overall planning for staffing short-term primary schools, and the art friend system should be implemented to make it easier for students to be trained and to distribute teachers universally. In addition to Fuyang, Huangli, and Huizhou, teachers should be designated elsewhere. It seems that the treatment should be slightly higher in order to stabilize their lives.</p>
<p>Some short-term primary schools in each county have people who hold other positions and are distracted by outside affairs, some are nominally running the school but privately ask others to take their place, and some do not enroll students but hang the school sign at private schools and give the private school teachers a certain amount of subsidy. Such situations should be investigated and dealt with to warn against emulation.</p>
<p>Students and their parents in short-term primary schools in each county are mostly dissatisfied with the half-day two-part system. Schools with sufficient school buildings and equipment should set up more two-part systems with questions, or mixed two-part systems. For those with few students, ordinary complex compilation can be used, and direct teaching and indirect teaching can be used to allocate students so that students can be in school all day. However, complex teaching methods must be specially studied in order to be used freely.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the different levels of short-term primary school students, supplementary teaching materials can be given to those with stronger learning abilities and those who still request to study after graduation. All new and old readings from elementary schools and public schools, or commonly used texts circulating in the market, can be adopted as appropriate without restriction. The source of such materials can be purchased by students' parents or raised from donations. If teachers lack the ability to teach phonetic symbols, it seems that they can be temporarily suspended to avoid wasting time.</p>
<p>Difficulties arise and abuses emerge from the fact that the opening equipment and office expenses of short-term primary schools in each county are raised and designated by the chiefs of the joint guarantee. It is urgent to find ways to improve them. Xiuning plans to be planned and coordinated by the county government, and Wuhu plans to use the method of unified collection and expenditure, which are both worth referring to.</p>
<p>The salaries of short-term primary school teachers in each county, except for those who personally receive them in nearby places, can be sent to the schools or other designated places on a monthly basis by the county education bureau, with receipts being drawn up. The public expense is limited, but the short-term primary school teachers save a lot of time and money, which is a great benefit. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Key Issues Decided at the Sixth Preparatory Meeting: Regarding the question of how to print the association's publicity manual, it was resolved to allocate funds for printing from the association's preparatory expenses, and to solicit advertisements at the same time to provide support. The General Affairs Section will handle this. Since the deadline for submissions is approaching, should letters be sent directly to various provinces and cities to urge them to send works?

In the early morning, the London foreign exchange market saw a recent increase of 1.785 and a forward increase of 1.25.

<h3>Securities: Bulls Exit, Public Debt Shows Slight Rebound Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a slight rebound after rising for three consecutive days, which was expected. Observing that the bulls have not yet given up, there may still be a rally, but the amount of inventory is still large. The bulls are concentrated in a limited number of large accounts, while the shorts are mostly scattered. With only one week left until settlement, a squeeze on either side is inevitable. Market rumors are not credible. In terms of supply and demand, there will be fierce competition. Yesterday, the bulls exited in the morning, with sales of No. 4, 43, 45, and 48, and both buying and selling of No. 35. No. 54 saw some buying. Prices initially continued to rise by 1-2 jiao, starting with the domestic long-term bonds. Sales of No. 4 were very active, falling slightly by 5 fen, and market sentiment eased. Later, they fell by 2.5 to 4.5 jiao, indicating a lack of confidence and a tendency to follow the wind. In the second session, funds surged, and there was a rally. Nos. 4 and 11 saw sales. With the Class C bonds at a price of 2 yuan, No. 34 bought strongly, while No. 11 actually sold more, suppressing the price to 1.9 yuan at the close, further weakening confidence. In the afternoon, Nos. 4 and 11 suddenly saw some buying, and the sentiment shifted again. The market continued to be weak at the beginning of the session, with Class E and Class C bonds declining by 1-2 jiao. Starting with the long-term Class C bonds, the trend of buying and selling had changed, and retail investors followed the tide, slightly offsetting the losses. Later, they rebounded by 2 jiao, and Nos. 4, 11, and 59 were bullish at the close. Although the market situation did not change much, it continued to strengthen by 1-2 jiao, which was not enough to reverse the declining sentiment. As a result, prices mostly fell by 1-2 jiao to 4 jiao. The spot market price of Class C long-term bonds was the opening price in the morning, and the remaining three sessions did not open, so it was still up by 2 jiao compared to the previous day. The total number of transactions was 4,555,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Bulls Abandon Near-Term; Yarn Market Unlikely to Revive</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the situation softened. As the April contract approached delivery, although the bulls absorbed a large amount, they were concentrated on the long-term contracts. They had no intention of taking delivery this month, and the front line was still being arbitraged, so the near months were weak, and the far months were affected.</p>
<p>It is difficult for gold to fall by another yuan. At the opening of the yarn market in the morning, prices fell uniformly across all months, but the decline was not severe, and the trend was still moderate. Most of the bulls did not take action, and only a few added positions. As a result, each month fell by 5-6 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market sentiment remained flat in the afternoon, with a slight rebound in the third session. However, the trend weakened again at the close. As a result, each month fell by 2, 3, or 4 jiao compared to the morning's closing price. It was observed that 850 bales of Dafu were sold, 700 bales of Dafeng were sold, 700 bales of Jinchang were sold, 1,000 bales of Tongfeng were sold, 750 bales of Renfeng were sold, 550 bales of Changfeng were sold, 900 bales of Tonghe were sold, 750 bales of Shenji were sold, and 700 bales of Da were sold. 2,150 bales of Yukang were purchased, 1,150 bales of Yuda were purchased, 600 bales of Chengji were purchased, 800 bales of Hexing were purchased, 1,400 bales of Yi were purchased, 750 bales of Jinghua were purchased, 500 bales of Shengyuan were purchased, and 550 bales of Yongda were purchased. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>

<h3>Ample Delivery Chips; Cotton Decline Difficult to Reverse</h3>
<p>The cotton market was suppressed by the ample delivery supplies of the group, but Tongji tried its best to support it in the near term, and the towing was also huge, reaching 11,700 dans, but the momentum of the sellers was turbulent, and it was difficult to reverse the decline for a while.</p>
<p>The near-term cotton decline is getting stronger and stronger.</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market in the morning, the atmosphere was sluggish due to the approaching delivery period in recent months, with abundant delivery chips. Although the communications are still buying in large quantities in recent months, the amount is huge, reaching 7,800 dans, most cotton merchants are tending to be short. As a result, each month fell by 1.5 to 2 jiao compared with the closing price of the previous day.</p>
<p>The shorts in the afternoon opened the market to make swaps, and the decline in May was even stronger. By the second and third discs, the distant months suddenly rebounded, and the three inner products of flower were squeezed, jumping wildly by 2 yuan. Until the close, the distant months returned to fatigue. As a result, each month fell by 5 minutes to 1 jiao compared to the morning's closing price. 5 minutes, flat on the distant side. 4,400 dans were sold to Ju Yu, 2,200 dans to Dafeng, 3,100 dans to Zhenda, 2,000 dans to Yi, 2,100 dans to Changfeng, 6,100 dans to Run Kang, and 4,700 dans to Yi Kang 2,800 dans to Xinheng were sold, 2,800 dans to Deji were purchased, 11,700 dans to Tongji, 3,800 dans to Dachangcheng, 1,600 dans to Taichang, 1,400 dans to Jinkang, and 2,900 dans to Shenji 2,900 dans to Jinghua.</p>

<h3>News of Rain in Central Region; US Cotton Market Slightly Weak; British Cotton Prices All Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and the market was firm, with each month rising by 1 to 4 points. In the early morning, the market was good due to the good news from Liverpool, and short positions were offset, and domestic and foreign and industry limit-price purchases were made, and market prices rose. Soon, it rained in a part of the Central West Railway Sess Oklahoma, and there were two inches of water in Abelon. Retailers and long positions were closed, and brokers from the South and local merchants sold, and the market turned soft. This amount of rain was not serious, but it was enough to save it from drought. Before the close, there were slight industry purchases, and the settlement of nests rose 1 point, and futures rose 1 point to fall 4 points.</p>
<p>British spot cotton rose 9 points, and futures rose 45 points. Indian cotton speculators, futures traders, and Japanese merchants bought, and met many long-term profit-taking, counting Pingo rising 2.75 roshis, Omra rising 1.25 roshis, and Bailuo Creek rising 2.25 roshis.</p>

<h3>Grains: Flour Production Cannot Be Easily Expanded at the Moment</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, prices for all months saw a uniform firming. Foreign wheat quotations showed declines, with Chicago down by 0.03 USD and Canada down by 0.01 USD. Initially, market sentiment was calm, but it soon turned upward due to limited supplies for the current month, preventing factories from expanding production immediately.  Prices for deferred months were influenced by the upcoming new wheat harvest in February, with factories offering few contracts and traders releasing few holdings. Consequently, prices also rose, increasing by 0.01 to 0.02 USD compared to the previous day. During the afternoon session, while trading in the current month was not very active, sentiment remained firm. Deferred contracts continued to rise initially but then weakened as long positions were reduced. Without any special developments, the market is expected to trade sideways for the time being.</p>

<h3>Futures Wheat Disconnects from Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the futures wheat market, after the opening bell in the morning, prices for all months initially showed stability followed by increases. Foreign wheat quotations declined by 0.02 to 0.03 USD, leading to initial market stability. However, due to the strong flour market, uncertainty about the new wheat harvest, and rising grain prices in various regions, sentiment grew cautious. By the closing bell, prices had risen by 0.03 to 0.04 USD. The afternoon session saw light trading with sideways movement. Initial prices continued to rise by 0.01 to 0.02 USD but later retreated. Future developments will depend on the new wheat crop conditions. The spot wheat market remains stable, with Shandong Yaowan wheat trading at 5.32 USD and Tiantai wheat at 5.28 USD. Fuxin purchased 700 bags.</p>

<h3>Decreased Arrivals of Guest Xian Rice, Local Sales Are Good, Price Reversal Is Hoped For</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the Guest Xian rice market, arrivals came from various ports along the Yangtze River and eastern Zhejiang, but volumes were low, while demand was strong. The sluggish market showed signs of recovery. If local merchants and guest wholesalers continue to buy, prices may rise gradually. Although local rice supplies are sufficient, foreign rice transport remains difficult. Trading remains quiet as both sides maintain their positions. Local sales of Guest Xian rice were decent yesterday, and buyers were making inquiries. There is hope for a turnaround in the market. Daily transactions included 2,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 540 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, 1,750 bags of Jiangbei rice, 161 bags of Anhui rice, and 340 bags of Hunan rice. Prices remained similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>River Rice Rebounds Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of suppliers remained at just over 30, with a total supply of over 6,000 dan. The market was initially weak but tightened later. Bao Wei of Tianjin only purchased over 1,000 bags. As a result, the price of thick early japonica rice increased by 0.10 USD, and paddy rice also tightened. Du Yang pointed rice remained similar, and Yin Bian Yuan was stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 36 or 37 boats arrived from various areas along the river. Sales were brisk in the market, and retail sales continued. Bao Wei of Tianjin rice moved slightly, and the market tightened by several fen to over 0.10 USD. Early rice followed closely, tightening by nearly 0.10 USD. Sales of thin rice remained sluggish, and prices were stable. Yang Du pointed rice continued to see retail sales, and prices tightened by a few fen. Port customers held firm on pointed rice, and Yin Bian Yuan was stable. Prices for other varieties showed a tendency to increase.</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Shantou Exchange Rate Increases, Chaozhou Sugar Remains Difficult to Loosen</h3>
<p>Regarding domestic Chaozhou sugar, according to reliable news from Shantou, the rumor of Qing sugar being converted to coarse sand is impossible and uncalculated, and such a thing will never happen. However, Shantou still needs to see an increase, with the possibility of reaching 1,200 yuan. Originally, if the exchange rate increases, the market price could be lowered, but the inventory in Shantou is not abundant. If the exchange rate increases, the accumulated price will also rise accordingly, and there is no hope of seeing a decrease for the time being. Therefore, the Shanghai market is gradually tightening. Few merchant's goods are being offered. Yesterday, only a total of 53 bags of Qing sugar were traded at 10.04 USD per bag. There were no further offers. However, miscellaneous white sugar showed signs of downstream demand.</p>
<p>The Public Association's trading panel, such as second-grade coarse sand white, Dong Chi white, and local factory cotton white, called out the original price. There were few buyers and no signs of improvement. However, after the inter-bid, the future market suddenly rose by 5 yuan. If the customs gold tightens today, it may improve slightly.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Platform Company held its term for bid exchange yesterday. The total quota was 4,607 bags. The bid price remained unchanged. As a result, a total of 540 bags were traded, including 530 bags of Five Sheep coarse white sugar produced in Guangzhou at 11.85 USD per bag, and 1 bag of No. 4 cotton white sugar at 20.09 USD per bag. The remaining Qu Xi coarse white sugar at 21.65 USD, No. cotton sugar at 21.10 USD, and medium sand white sugar at 20.06 USD were not sold.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: New Season Is Still Far Away, Daylily Market Is Tightening</h3>
<p>Daylily: Although the sales of goods from Guangdong are not prosperous, the inventory in the Kui market is ultimately low, and the source is lacking. Therefore, merchant's warehouses are holding back on offering goods, and the trend is tightening. It is heard that the price of Zhenjiang production has also rebounded by about 1 yuan. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang merchant's warehouse quoted a higher price of 27 yuan for better-quality goods. The quoted prices for other Xuzhou daylilies have also increased, and there is no intention to sell urgently. The future market is bound to tighten. The new season is still far away. After a long period of fatigue, there is often a possibility of rebounding.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Old Fish Maw Inventory Is Not High</h3>
<p>New fish maw will soon be available, but the old goods in the warehouses and the inventory on the street are also running low, so the market situation is extremely stable. However, the purchase of long goods has recently been suspended by foreign firms, and sales are sluggish. Reliance on business from Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, and other domestic sources is limited. Therefore, the market is slightly weaker than before. The inventory at the bottom is not high, and prices can still be maintained. Yesterday, brokers offered high-quality long glue at 100 yuan, second-quality at 90 yuan, rootless goods at 110 yuan, Ningbo Zhamian glue at 150 yuan to 140 yuan, Dadao Yuan dried at 135 yuan, general goods at 130 yuan, Waishan tip slice belly at 165 yuan to 160 yuan, Wenzhou goods first grade at 160 yuan, second grade at 140 yuan, Diaopian belly at 120-130 yuan, thick Zhuang rice fish glue at 148 yuan, and Tongshou at 120 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Firms Traded Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk prices rebounded slightly, but Shanghai silk prices were small, so transactions with foreign firms have gradually approached. For example, Baichang's June and July futures were resold yesterday. Although the price was slightly weaker, it was still satisfactory. It is estimated that Xinfu Dachang and other firms purchased a total of 35 bales.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: La Seine Flannel Is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market atmosphere at the Wool Fabric Public Welfare Association was very good. There were transactions from both local merchants and customers from other regions. Most of the running street brokers had substantial sales, mostly by check. La Seine flannel is currently selling well. Door merchants and Western clothing merchants all have substantial imports. Yongle's first-grade goods were sold yesterday at a uniform price of 4.95 USD per yard, and Haohua's goods were sold at 3.85 USD, up from the previous day. This is because the foreign firms have run out of stock, and the current market is short of spot goods.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Supply and Demand for Large Tinplate Are Balanced</h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of incoming large tinplate, there is a fear of running out of stock. New Taikoo Warehouses have had new goods arriving since the day before yesterday, but the number is limited. Therefore, those who hold the goods continue to hoard them, so prices are very firm. However, the transaction is quite strong, and the goods offered are also quite impressive. The 24-gauge patterned tinplate is selling well due to strong purchases from yarn factories and is also short of stock. Therefore, the standard once rose to 400 yuan. Recently, some have been loaded overseas, and the sales market has slightly loosened, selling for 200 yuan per box. It is estimated that 20 to 30 boxes have been offered in the past two days. Although 26-gauge yarn factories and toy factories also have transactions, the inventory is larger. More than a dozen boxes have been offered, and the most sales are made by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road. Although hardware stores along Bailao Road also have inventory, the asking price is very high, so transactions are slightly quiet.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Black and White Pepper Prices Fall</h3>
<p>For use in the pharmaceutical industry, produced in Dutch-owned Makassar and other places, the amount imported into our country each year is quite large. In past years, imports have always been over 10,000 dan. Although there was a poor harvest last year, there were still over 8,000 dan. The largest sales markets are Sichuan and Hubei. Demand in the northern provinces is also very common, but customer sales are strongest in the winter. Now, in late spring and early summer, the climate is gradually getting hotter, and business is becoming sparse, so the market is also trending downward. Yesterday, merchant's warehouses offered 40 packages of black pepper at 41.50 yuan, 20 packages of No. 1 pepper at 41 yuan, 17 packages of white pepper, high-quality goods at 78 yuan, and second-quality goods at 70.05 yuan, down 1 yuan from the previous offering. There are few buyers, and the market is extremely weak.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Yellow Gardenia Declines</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of yellow gardenia is occasional, but sales are declining. Therefore, there are few buyers for ordinary goods, and sales are becoming sluggish. Yesterday, it was heard that a batch has been offered, and the quality is still dry, but the color is not good, causing the asking price to fall by nearly 1 yuan compared to the previous offer. However, goods with large grains and good color are still in demand due to low inventory, and the market is expected to remain stable in the future. The arrival and inventory are rare, and the future can be expected to be stable.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Women's Supplement</p>
<h3>Consolidating Our Right to Self-Determination</h3>
<p>— Lu Gu Wenshu</p>
<p>In the past decade or so, amidst the clash of new and old ideas, our Chinese women's sphere has seen three distinct perspectives on our relationship with ourselves, society, and family.</p>
<p>The first advocates that serving society is more important than managing a household, based on the ideas of 18th-century thinkers like Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Olympe de Gouges, who believed that women are also human beings and should stand on an equal footing with men. Therefore, women should also devote themselves to serving society, considering that a woman's primary function is not merely to raise children and perpetuate the race.</p>
<p>The second argues that family is more important than society, diametrically opposed to the previous view. It suggests that women, due to their physiology or knowledge, are better suited to stay at home, manage household affairs, and educate children, as the Bible says, "A good woman holds the distaff in her hand and does the hardest work." This means fulfilling a woman's natural duty and being a model of a virtuous wife and good mother, without constantly showing her face outside. Furthermore, men governing the outside and women governing the inside perfectly embodies the spirit of human cooperation. Besides, if women always stay at home, it can reduce the number of unemployed people in society, which is very beneficial to society, isn't it?</p>
<p>The third advocates for equal emphasis on serving society and managing a household, encompassing the reasons of the previous two. It believes that if women can value both career and family equally, without distinguishing between them, their status can remain high permanently. At the same time, they won't forget their instincts, neither failing society nor neglecting their family, becoming a perfect woman.</p>
<p>After careful consideration of the above three views, the last one seems the most reasonable and appropriate. However, in reality, it is not easy to achieve, because one person has to take care of both sides. Unlike mothers in Soviet Russia and Germany who can have someone take care of their housework and children while they work outside, this view is only good in theory but not very practical.</p>
<p>As for the first and second views, they seem very different on the surface. However, a study of their core reveals that they are still the same. The core of the first is serving society, and I say that the core of the second is also serving society. Why? Because raising well-behaved children at home is to cultivate them into pure and noble citizens in the future, and isn't this work indirectly serving society?</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that all these views are correct. We only need to determine the way we serve society, directly or indirectly, based on our own environment, situation, body, temperament, and knowledge. We should not be confined to a certain prejudice, rigidly defining that doing this is right and doing that is wrong, becoming a woman without any autonomy. In short, the most important thing is to know that the right to choose the path of our relationship with society and family belongs to us. We must permanently protect this sacred right of self-determination, and not allow anyone or any force to direct, interfere with, or control it.</p>
<h3>The Joys of Singlehood</h3>
<p>— Meng Su</p>
<p>Greedy for Freedom... Abandoning Responsibility</p>
<p>I have a friend who is a single woman of thirty-six years old, whose charm has not diminished with age. Her family is middle-class. Her parents are both well-known in the community. She herself has received higher education. In the past few years, she has been pursued by many men in the romantic arena, but she has never fallen into love. In recent years, she has resolutely rejected all proposals and expressed her determination to remain single for the rest of her life. She is now a woman with a noble profession. I have debated with her repeatedly about her stubborn views, hoping that she would change her mind, marry a good husband as soon as possible, and become a virtuous wife and good mother of the new era. However, her eloquence was unimpeded, and she rejected my advice outright. Summarizing her views, there are many wonderful remarks as follows:</p>
<p>"Freedom is the most beautiful truth in the world. People are born for freedom and die for freedom. Among women, only unmarried women can truly enjoy freedom and happiness."</p>
<p>"I am willing to fully enjoy freedom during my lifetime, and I am unwilling to sell my innate freedom at any price..."</p>
<p>"I make a living myself, freely choose my profession, and freely associate with my friends, unlike married women who are restrained by their husbands' preferences. I can avoid insincere socializing because of the people my husband loves. I can do whatever I want with everything in the world. When I love quiet, I can be alone without the disturbance of children. If I want children to accompany me, I can choose one from the orphanage and touch her."</p>
<p>"Because I am an unmarried woman, and my appearance is not below average, almost every man who sees me expresses obvious willingness to get close. I only allow them to be my spiritual friends. This may not be enough to be proud of."</p>
<p>"My sisters of the same age are now wives or mothers of a group of children. Every time they meet me, they always talk about my life and future. They even hold infinite worries for me, as if they see me as a lonely boat in the sea, not knowing where it will drift; as if they see me as a lost lamb, sooner or later to be swallowed by wild jackals. As for me, I am indifferent to their well-intentioned overthinking. I cannot understand where the happiness of marriage lies. I regard myself as a vast wild goose, soaring freely to the east, west, south, and north; going up and down in all directions as I please. Why shouldn't I enjoy my own beauty for a long time!..."</p>
<p>I express infinite admiration and great regret for this self-admiring modern "Bei Gong Ying'er." Freedom is indeed precious. But how can marriage deprive a woman of her entire freedom? There are indeed many discordant couples in the world, but there are also many harmonious couples. If you are afraid of falling into the forest of discordant couples and remain single for a long time, how is that different from giving up eating for fear of choking? The joy of family among loving couples, how can it be dreamed of by those who bitterly adhere to singlehood! Even putting aside the calculation of joy and suffering, the male and female bodies of human beings are predetermined by nature, and there is a joint responsibility to be borne.</p>
<p>In ancient times, Bei Gong Ying'er removed her earrings and ornaments and did not marry until old age in order to support her parents. How could parents be willing to make their daughters spend their lives as widows in order to entertain themselves in their old age? Therefore, this kind of filial piety has long become a thing of the past; moreover, merely for personal freedom, to lightly cast off the responsibility that should be borne for the nation, how is that different from a soldier deserting before battle! Although the law does not prohibit people from being single, it also cannot be justified on the grounds of moral law.</p>
<h3>Ugly Women and Crime</h3>
<p>— Hui Fang</p>
<p>In the position of social life, beautiful women and ugly women each have different attitudes. A beauty with a bad fate often feels that the happiness of an ugly woman is an unnatural state and harbors dissatisfaction. As for an ugly woman who has suffered misfortune, she feels that this encounter is entirely caused by her ugliness, and she feels depressed and unhappy.</p>
<p>All ugly women are mostly "sexually weak," so they often try to use strengths other than appearance to make up for the shortcomings of ugliness; such as performing arts, skills, decoration, wealth, etc., which can achieve this goal in many situations. Moreover, ugly women are mostly not as arrogant as beautiful women. The so-called "ugly woman's deep affection" is also the reason for this. However, the ugly woman's awareness of being a "sexually inferior person" can never be eliminated by the above-mentioned supplements, and its influence on her daily life is deeply rooted. Therefore, it has a considerable relationship with crime.</p>
<p>According to those who handle fat crime cases, the number of ugly women who commit adultery is high. Although this cannot be said to be an entirely credible fact, there is also a suitable reason for it. Because ugly women lack the attention and contact of men, it is not easy to obtain the enthusiasm of men, as with many beautiful women. Once a man treats her sincerely, according to common sense, she is very likely to have great pleasure and feel sexual satisfaction. This is the major reason that drives ugly women closer to crime. Women who often lack interaction with the opposite sex and are estranged from each other will never easily let go of this opportunity when they unexpectedly obtain this opportunity, causing them to lose their discretion and consideration, and sacrifice their chastity. There is also a saying that although there are also many beautiful women who commit adultery, compared with the adultery of ugly women, there is a great difference. Because the husband of a beautiful woman, even if he finds out that his wife has committed adultery, he may deliberately hide the matter for fear of losing this beautiful woman. On the contrary, if a woman who has an affair is an ugly woman, then her husband has already been more alienated from her on weekdays, and at this time, he will have less forgiveness, and therefore expose her ugly behavior. According to the numbers, the fact that ugly women commit adultery with others more often may be a superficial phenomenon. This theory also seems to have its own point of view.</p>
<p>Furthermore, because ugly women are not easy to obtain the love of the opposite sex, when they occupy the opposite sex, they must do their best to cater to them, making every effort to please them, pouring all their love and goodwill on their opponents. Once they are abandoned by their opponents, or their opponents are taken away by others, they will inevitably experience intense emotions such as jealousy, anger, and resentment, which is very different from the coldness of beautiful women towards the opposite sex. Because she wants to avenge the hatred of this "sexual failure," an abandoned woman can commit crimes such as arson and murder. A close examination of such items disclosed in the daily headlines shows that ugly women are in the majority. This kind of hatred can also be vented by committing adultery with others. There are also cases where a woman is abandoned by her husband, leading her to become self-abandoned, resulting in crimes. Or, embarrassed by the difficulty of life, they commit adultery with others in order to seek reliance, or obtain money, and engage in prostitution.

<h3>The Actual Situation of French Women's Lives</h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>When we talk about the prosperity of Paris, we often associate it with the romance, extravagance, and debauchery of the women there. All of this is enough to symbolize that they are not a country of a high-class people. However, those who have actually been to the whole of France know that French women also have to work hard at the productive work they should be responsible for, and no one is willing to waste the whole day in enjoyment. Although they regard entertainment and decoration as their second life besides work, we know that the people of any country should be given adequate time for rest and entertainment besides work.</p>
<p>French women are probably less involved in national institutions because they do not have the right to vote. Almost all of them seek development in commerce. In the business fields and shops of any city or town, female employees account for six out of ten. As for entertainment venues (including cinemas, dance halls, and cafes), they are completely run by women. For the sake of business transactions, they inevitably have opportunities to come into contact with male customers, which creates the spark for their romance. Moreover, in their country, it is not a big deal for a woman to marry seven or eight times. Society does not add any contempt or discrimination to them.</p>
<p>As for women in the fields and villages, they are even more honest, simple, and hardworking than those in the cities. In spring and autumn, women in the fields get up every day before dawn (which is about 4:00 AM in our country), the whole family has to get up, hurriedly eat breakfast, and then the family has to work in the fields with hoes and plows until sunset before returning home to rest. As for women working in factories, they also work eight hours a day, starting work at 6:00 AM, stopping work at 10:00 AM, starting work at 12:00 PM, and stopping work at 4:00 PM. It is not like our country, which adopts a night work system, because their national women's association has a regulation that "the night belongs to all of us women." Although many women are willing to increase night work for the sake of livelihood, once the state finds out, the factory will be punished by the state.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that married women in France should bear a great responsibility. When children reach school age, mothers have to send them to school for a considerable education. Only after the state has tested them and passed them after a certain number of years can mothers be completely relieved of their responsibilities. Therefore, only a small number of women with children are still serving in society. Otherwise, they are entrusted to an agency specializing in managing student education (there is no specific term for this there, but these places are very common, somewhat like nurseries in the Soviet Union.) However, as mothers, they still have to constantly undertake the educational duties of supervising and correcting.</p>
<p>Their most common entertainment venue is the coffee shop established in every city, town, and village because the dance halls in the city require great architecture and magnificent equipment. People in the countryside and fields do not need these because the coffee shops there are not just eateries like in our country, but also places where they can dance and have fun. They open at 7:00 PM every night, and then men and women come here one after another, but they stop at 10:00 PM. Their entertainment program is only drinking a cup of coffee and dancing a few times, and there are absolutely no excessive actions.</p>
<p>From the above brief report on the lives of French women, we know that they are also an advancing nation, and like Soviet women, they have to work hard for the country's production. They are definitely not like our country's women who spend the whole day engaging in a life of pleasure.</p>
<h3>Losing One's Temper</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Nine out of ten Chinese women suffer from liver qi disease. It is said that when liver qi attacks, a lump of qi pushes upward from the chest, and the patient groans and writhes in great pain. It is said that Xi Shi clutching her chest in pain was probably due to an attack of liver qi. There is no specific medicine for treating liver qi. Many patients have told me that just taking a puff of opium will make the qi lump in the chest disappear. I don't know if this is drinking poison to quench thirst, and it has ruined many people!</p>
<p>Old-fashioned women often develop liver qi disease because of discord between husband and wife, discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, or because they have suffered other anger. Mrs. Zhao envied vanity when she was young, and her youth was wasted. Later, she married a wealthy opium addict, thinking that she could finally be satisfied. Who knew that her husband would marry a concubine, and from then on, quarrels and disputes between husband and wife were often heard, and she developed liver qi disease. Fortunately, smoking was convenient, so she became inextricably linked with opium, and every time she met someone with the same disease, she would praise the miraculous effect of opium, and respectfully give it to others to smoke, beautifully calling it "a fragrant puff."</p>
<p>Mrs. Han is her neighbor. That lady has a belly as big as a five-stone gourd, and it is said that she also suffers from liver qi disease. The reason for her illness was due to a sentence from her mother-in-law. Once, she suffered from dystocia, and everyone else was anxious, but her mother-in-law sneered, "Others can give birth and raise children quickly, only you..." Mrs. Han got angry when she heard this, and she got liver qi disease. One day, the two ladies met, and they first talked about some trivial household matters, and then they talked about the problem of liver qi disease, and Mrs. Zhao wanted to persuade Mrs. Han to take "a fragrant puff" again. Mrs. Han was afraid of being scolded by her husband, so she finally did not dare to take a puff; however, sympathizing with each other, it is difficult for Mrs. Han to guarantee that she will not follow in Mrs. Zhao's footsteps!</p>
<p>Chinese women have always been good at worrying and prone to illness: worrying is nothing more than being subjected to qi stagnation; and nine out of ten diseases are probably liver qi disease. However, opium can eliminate the qi lump in the chest; therefore, I especially cite the above facts to persuade the ladies in the family not to be fooled by it again.</p>
<h3>Women of Qinghai</h3>
<p>— Yu Lin</p>
<p>Qinghai is in the west of China. The people there build tents as houses. A stove is set up in the tent, and the tent is divided into two parts. The left part is for men, and the right part is for women. They think it is a shameful thing for husband and wife to sleep in the same place.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between men and women in Qinghai. Anyone who has been to Qinghai will definitely see many young men and women holding guns and riding horses to hunt wild animals in the mountains and fields.</p>
<p>Every morning, women in Qinghai drive livestock into the mountains to graze, and at noon, they milk cows and sheep. In the afternoon, they are at home doing things such as fetching water, twisting wool, washing clothes, and making sour milk, gum milk, milk residue, milk cakes, milk butter, milk powder, and milk rice. In addition to the above things, women do, other things such as sewing clothes and shooting guns to catch thieves are all the responsibility of the men.</p>
<p>Women's clothes are all made of silk, and their coats are all made of animal skins. The sleeves of the clothes they wear only reach below the wrist, and the waist is very tight. The skirts they wear are very long and tight all around because they do not wear pants all year round. They do not wash themselves all year round, and even when they wash, they only use a teacup to hold water and dab it. Their hair is braided into hundreds of braids, and a cloth is attached to the braids, about five inches wide, all the way to the heel, and silver ornaments and agate stones are hung on it. Poor people also have copper stones hanging on them, weighing several pounds. The earrings are as big as our bracelets, and some even add two strings of coral, hanging on the shoulders, as a beauty.</p>
<p>Special Feature from this Newspaper</p>
<h3>Mrs. Shao Yuanchong, Ms. Zhang Mojun, on Women's Issues</h3>
<p>— Ji Ping</p>
<p>Ms. Zhang Mojun is one of the leaders of women's suffrage in China, and the reporter has long admired her. During this tour of the capital, I was introduced by Dr. Zhu Junyi and had the pleasure of meeting her. The lady is graceful in appearance, but her words and deeds are dignified and upright, worthy of being a heroine. Everything she discusses should be regarded as a model by the women's community. The following is a record of the conversation:</p>
<p>What are the things worth remembering from your time as a student?</p>
<p>"When I was studying, there were three things worth remembering: (1) When I was young, I studied at Wuben Girls' Middle School in Shanghai between the years of Jia Chen and Bing Wu. At that time, I had already joined the Tongmenghui and engaged in the revolutionary movement; at that time, the Qing court's search and arrest were very strict, so my actions were extremely secretive. One day, Principal Wu Huaijiu summoned me to the office and asked, "Why did you join the Tongmenghui and engage in revolutionary work?" I knew that he had read my correspondence and discovered it, so I replied, "The Manchus, as a foreign race, have entered the Central Plains and implemented autocratic tyranny, oppressing our nation and shackling our people's intelligence; making it impossible for our nation to develop and the national power to decline day by day. All of us Han people should rise up and join the Tongmenghui, unite as one, and overthrow the foreign government." Wu said, "This matter is extremely dangerous! In case it is discovered in the future, be careful not to implicate the school." I said sternly, "A man who undertakes a task dares to act and dare to bear the responsibility. If I do something, I should bear the responsibility myself and never implicate others." Wu smiled when he heard this and said, "How brave you are, young man!" (2) One day, a woman came to the school to visit me. It happened that I was out, and when I returned, the schoolboy told me, "A woman in a kimono came to visit just now. She didn't say her name, but left a note." I looked at the note, which said: "I am returning to the country for important matters, and will return gradually in a few days. I would like to contact you first. I didn't meet you at the moment and didn't wait long. I am disappointed!" Below was signed a "Qiu" character. When I saw this character, I knew that she was my comrade Qiu Jin. At that time, because I didn't know her address, I couldn't return the visit, which was very disappointing. Not long after, I heard that she was martyred in Zhejiang. I regretted very much that I didn't go with her at that time to shed blood for the nation together, and I was unhappy for months. (3) Once, Wuben Girls' School held a school-wide sports meeting. There was an item called "Race with Flags." The teacher ordered me to write on four pieces of cloth of several feet square in the midst of a crowd. I immediately waved the four large characters "I Jianwu Jie," which were in the Northern Wei style, which is different from my current calligraphy. At that time, newspapers made versions and published them. This was also taking advantage of the momentary excitement to show the promotion of the martial spirit of our nation. Thinking back to my childhood, there is a lingering taste."</p>
<p>Please recall the social undertakings you have created in the past.</p>
<p>"The social undertakings that I have participated in in the past can be summarized into four categories: In the autumn of Xinhai, after Mr. Bochun restored Suzhou, I ran the Min Pao at Keyuan in Canglang Pavilion to promote democratic politics: In the first year of the Republic of China, I and several women initiated the "Women's Assistance Association" in Shanghai, raising tens of thousands of yuan for the Northern Expeditionary Army, and several people personally went to Nanjing to see the Provisional President Sun Gong: I initiated the Shenzhou Women's Progressive Society and founded the Shenzhou Women's School and Shenzhou Women's News, engaging in educational and academic national salvation movements for more than ten years: I and Mrs. Xiong Zhuqi and others initiated the Jiangsu People's Education Promotion Association in Nanjing, which is the pioneer of people's education in China."</p>
<h3>Ms. Zhang Mojun</h3>
<p>Please instruct Chinese women on the path to self-awareness.</p>
<p>"This matter is extremely important and cannot be fully explained in a few words. In summary, Chinese women should cultivate their body and mind with the inherent morality of China, and pay attention to the influence of personality; use education and academics to improve Chinese society and save the country from danger!"</p>
<p>Please criticize the weaknesses of Chinese women.</p>
<p>"I think that among modern women, the number of intellectuals has increased relatively, but they all have common shortcomings: lack of connection and cooperation, lack of organizational ability, and less responsibility and more suspicion."</p>
<p>What are your opinions on "good wives and mothers" and "good fathers and husbands"?</p>
<p>"This issue has been debated for a long time and is disliked by ordinary new women. In my opinion, the so-called good wives and mothers are considered indispensable in societies both ancient and modern, both Chinese and foreign. Why is this? If you want the country to be strong, you must first seek the soundness of the family. Women are the center of the family. If there is no good mother and good wife in a family to preside over it, then the failure of the family is conceivable. However, the happiness of a family depends on the cooperation of both men and women. The prerequisite for a good mother and good wife is a good father and husband. This issue requires equal emphasis on both sides, and neither can be neglected. The greatest strength of a good mother and good wife is sincerity. From sincerity comes motherly love, which I believe is the greatest, purest, and most lasting love in the world, surpassing the love of mothers. If people can extend and generalize their motherly love, treat the whole nation with the heart of a child, then the world can achieve great harmony. The good mother I advocate is a broad concept, not only representing the world, but also benefiting all races. All of this depends on people doing it well."</p>
<p>What is your idea of managing a family?</p>
<p>My idea of managing a family is based on morality and the influence of personality, and then creating a healthy and beautiful family with a scientific and artistic spirit, in line with the teachings of the sages "renewing virtue every day" and "renewing for a long time," and promoting a "new life society."</p>

<h3>Bone Pain Smoking Cessation Method (1)</h3>
<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Smoking cessation is a painful matter. It is even more painful to quit smoking because of illness, and even more painful to quit smoking because of bone pain. When the smoking addiction occurs, the spirit is depressed and the whole body loses its natural state. Those who suffer from old bone pain experience sore and painful joints and twitching muscles. Combining this with the pain of smoking addiction is like double shackles.</p>
<p>For example, last autumn, a bone pain patient, Pei Yuqing, repeatedly sought to quit smoking, but the pain was unbearable and he stopped halfway. Later, I instructed him to purchase and take "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Sino-French Pharmacy to treat his bone pain. After the bone pain was relieved, he felt comfortable all over. He then took "Reproductive Element" to remove toxins and break the addiction, and he safely quit smoking, felt happy, and regained his health.</p>
<h3>Stomach Pain Smoking Cessation Method (2)</h3>
<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>Most people smoke to relieve pain. Stomach pain and smoking account for most of them. Opium cannot cure diseases or relieve pain, but it contains paralyzing toxins that can cover up the pain for a while. By the time the person is addicted, the pain will worsen, and it will no longer be able to paralyze and cover up unless the dose is repeatedly increased.</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Wang Zhizhou came to seek smoking cessation. He said that he had become addicted to smoking because of intractable stomach pain. I instructed him to purchase and take "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Stomach Strengthening Element" from the Taihe Pharmacy to treat his stomach pain, and use "Reproductive Element" to nourish and remove the addiction. He said that his pain was relieved and his addiction was broken.</p>
<h3>Seminal Emission Smoking Cessation Method (3)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Seminal emission and nocturnal emission are generally caused by deficiency of the reproductive glands and relaxation of the seminal gate. However, those who quit smoking often complain of this symptom. The treatment method is to strengthen the essence and nourish the reproductive glands. This is the radical cure method.</p>
<p>The smoker Zhou Guodong came to the clinic last month and complained of the pain of seminal emission, which made it difficult to complete the smoking cessation. I instructed him to purchase "Simitu's Essence Strengthening Tablets" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy to cure his seminal emission, and mainly used "Reproductive Element" to remove toxins and break the addiction, because "Reproductive Element" is a good tonic for smoking cessation, so the reproductive glands flourish during smoking cessation and seminal emission never recurs.</p>
<h3>Menstrual Regulation and Bandage Therapy: Gynecology Gospel</h3>
<p>(Mr. and Mrs. Gao Jingxi wrote a letter saying) We are jointly writing this letter to express our gratitude. Thank you for the grace of this journal in bestowing happiness on our family. My wife, Ren, was originally weak. Nine years ago, she suffered from menstrual disorders and prolonged leucorrhea due to postpartum disorders. Her body became even more deficient, her body became thinner, her spirit was weak, her mind was tired, her vitality was lost, and happiness was rare. She repeatedly sought treatment, but none had any effect. Last month, I wrote to this journal and was shown that I could take (female reproductive element) internally and use (bandaging spirit) externally for treatment. I immediately purchased them from the nearby Sino-French Pharmacy and used them internally and externally according to the law. Now, the menstruation has been regulated and the bandage has been taken off. Her body is strong and healthy, and she has regained the health and beauty of her honeymoon. These two drugs are truly the gospel of gynecology.</p>
<h3>Famous Drugs for Kidney Weakness and Premature Ejaculation Save Lives</h3>
<p>(Mr. Fan Xiulun wrote a letter saying) I am far away in southern Yunnan and suffer from venereal disease, kidney weakness, and premature ejaculation, which is extremely painful. I want to seek treatment, but medicine is inconvenient. Last autumn, I read this journal and hurriedly wrote to ask for treatment methods. I was shown the safest way to come to Shanghai for medical treatment and electrotherapy. I can take "Reproductive Element" to treat myself. At that time, because I was separated by thousands of mountains, I could not spare myself. I immediately wrote to the Western Medicine Department of Shanghai Wing On Company to purchase half a dozen famous drugs "Reproductive Element" and took them internally according to the law. Before half a dozen were finished, premature ejaculation was cured first, and kidney weakness was also cured. (Omission in the middle) Vitality was revived, no less than being reborn.</p>
<h3>Underdevelopment</h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The patient Chen Yaobang committed masturbation when he was young, resulting in a thin and weak body and no development. Hundreds of diseases occurred. Last autumn, he came to complain of the pain of seminal emission and insomnia. I instructed him to purchase "Simitu's Essence Strengthening Tablets" and "Reproductive Element" from the Wuzhou Pharmacy. After the seminal emission was cured, his body quickly recovered and became strong, and he regained development.</p>
<h3>Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The patient Xiong Zhaonian came last autumn and complained of symptoms such as soreness in the waist and back, trembling body, and cold limbs. I diagnosed that Mr. Xiong also suffered from sore joints, and immediately instructed him to purchase "Reproductive Element" and "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy and take them together. He immediately felt strength in his waist and back, his whole body felt light and healthy, his joints were comfortable, and his limbs were flexible. He thanked him happily and left.</p>

<h3>Case Records of Venereal Disease Diagnosis and Treatment</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(Clinic) Second floor of China Trust Company at the corner of Xichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>(1) Radical Treatment of Gonococcal Arthralgia</p>
<p>To seek radical treatment, you must search for and eliminate residual toxins.</p>
<p>Patient Shi Zhichu had previously suffered from gonorrhea, but the treatment was not thorough, and it recurred and was treated again, but it was still not thorough, resulting in gonorrhea accumulating in the bones and developing into symptoms of arthralgia, which was like stabbing and drilling, causing unbearable pain. He took various oral medications, but there was no improvement. His limbs gradually became numb, and he felt paralysis in half of his body. It was not until late autumn that he was introduced by a colleague to be treated. In addition to radically treating his gonorrhea, I also instructed him to purchase and take "Strongston's Bone Pain Tablets" from the Sino-Western Pharmacy to search for and eliminate residual toxins. His joints immediately felt comfortable, his hands and feet immediately became flexible, his whole body felt light and healthy, and his spirit was refreshed. He was like a different person before and after.</p>
<p>(2) Circumcision and Electrotherapy Save Young People</p>
<p>Radical treatment of seminal emission and kidney weakness.</p>
<p>Patient Han Boxi committed masturbation when he was young, resulting in an overly long foreskin and a weak body, suffering from symptoms such as kidney weakness and seminal emission. He was already over twenty years old, but his local area was as small as a child of ten. He had been married for three years, but it was only in name. His relationship was indifferent and like strangers. He lost his sense of life, had no share of happiness, and had no hope of having children. His body and mind were decadent. Later, he saw that his close relative Mr. Zhang was suffering from the same symptoms, and he was cured by me, so he asked him to introduce him to be treated. In addition to performing painless surgery to remove the foreskin and local electrotherapy, I also instructed him to purchase and take "Simitu's Essence Strengthening Tablets" from the Huamei Pharmacy to strengthen his seminal gate, and used "Reproductive Element" to nourish his deficiencies. Vitality was revived, happiness was reborn, and the couple's relationship was far better than when they were newlyweds.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's outpatient hours are from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, and he is closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Clinical Case Examples</h3>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, Benxue Wenni University, USA</p>
<p>(Clinic) Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road, Shanghai</p>
<p>Treatment for Long-Standing, Stubborn Stomach Ailments</p>
<p>The patient has stopped taking medication for many months after treatment and has not had a recurrence.</p>
<p>Patient Zhu Lianqing came last autumn complaining of recurrent stomach pain, so severe he could not lie down. Medication provided temporary relief but no permanent cure. On average, he experienced pain more than twice a week, making stomach medicine indispensable, like a second life. However, the dosage needed kept increasing. After examination, I found Mr. Zhu's stomach lining was eroded, causing the pain due to ulceration. I immediately prescribed "Weitong," purchased from the Anglo-Chinese Dispensary, to protect the lining and promote healing. The stomach pain gradually subsided and disappeared. I also prescribed "Jianweisu" to regulate his weak and sickly stomach, achieving a permanent cure. As he was underdeveloped, I advised him to take "Shengzhisu" to nourish his body. After about a month, he rapidly became stronger and developed. Recently, I received a thank-you letter from him, stating that his stomach pain had not recurred for many months, expressing his deep gratitude for the cure.</p>
<p>Joyfully Blessed with a Son After Prolonged Infertility</p>
<p>Restored Health and Beauty, Breast Development Regained</p>
<p>Patient Mrs. Cao Xilin came in early summer complaining of weakness, prolonged infertility, irregular menstruation, bone pain, and leucorrhea. Examination revealed Mrs. Cao's reproductive glands were atrophied, causing infertility. Furthermore, internal dampness and rheumatism caused toxins to enter the bones, leading to joint pain. I prescribed "Strong Deng's Bone Pain Pills" from the Yong'an Company's Western medicine department to remove toxins and relieve pain. I also prescribed "Female Shengzhisu" to regulate menstruation and treat leucorrhea. For rapid treatment, I also prescribed "Liaodailing" for external use. After about a month, she was completely cured, regaining health and beauty, and her breasts developed. Recently, I received a letter from Mr. Cao expressing his gratitude, stating that his wife had now given birth to a son, deeply grateful for the miracle of the renowned medicine.</p>

<h3>Relieving Schooling Loss and Reducing Tuition Fees</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Under our country's aristocratic education system, it is extremely difficult for young people to receive education. The high fees charged by schools at all levels are often beyond the means of ordinary people. As a result, only children from wealthy families have the opportunity to attend school, while children from ordinary families suffer from the hardship of not being able to afford education. Given the recent decline in the national economy, the number of young people who have lost the opportunity to attend school has only increased. This situation is extremely serious, not only for the individual misfortune of young people, but also for the loss to society and the nation!</p>
<p>Recently, in order to alleviate the loss of schooling for young people, the Ministry of Education submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, ordering all public and private schools across the country to set up free and publicly funded places from this year onwards as follows: Free places, A. Elementary schools should in principle not charge tuition fees. The implementation of this principle should be strictly examined and supervised. Even those that still charge fees should be ordered to gradually increase the number of free places; B. Secondary schools and higher vocational schools should set up at least 5% or more of the total number of students as free places; Publicly funded places should be set at 2% to 4% of the total number of students. This is an excellent approach, although the scope of relief is limited; however, at least some poor students can gain more opportunities to study. We hope that the principle of free tuition in elementary schools can be implemented as soon as possible so that compulsory education can be universally promoted. The number of free and publicly funded places in secondary and higher vocational schools should also be increased year by year so that those who cannot afford to study are not excluded from schools.</p>
<p>However, we believe that in order to alleviate the loss of schooling for young people, it is important to set up free and publicly funded places, but it is also urgent to order schools at all levels to reduce all fees. The former can only reward a small number of outstanding students with good character and academics who cannot afford to study, while the latter can reduce the burden on most student families. In our country's schools, in addition to tuition, board, and books, there are also fees for clothing, lectures, and physical education: there are truly many items that are difficult to list. Other extractions such as registration, admission, and compensation fees are unbearable. Therefore, we hope that the education authorities should pay attention to this point and find ways to improve it. In addition to setting a maximum tuition fee for schools at all levels, all improper fees must be abolished. In this way, a group of young people can have more opportunities to study. This is also a problem that cannot be ignored in alleviating the loss of schooling.</p>
<h3>Storm</h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>——A Story of Maritime Navigation——</p>
<p>The sky was so gloomy it felt like it was about to collapse. Strange gusts of wind blew across the Pearl River from time to time, causing people's hearts to tremble. Several foreign warships anchored on the Bai'etan sea across the river were all fired up. Their fat, sturdy smokestacks emitted thick plumes of black smoke, as if waiting for something. Anyone who had traveled on the inland river knew that this ominous weather was not a good sign, but for some reason, our cargo ship was about to set sail again from Guangzhou, heading up the Xijiang River. Everyone was unhappy, working listlessly as if unwilling.</p>
<p>"Damn your ancestors' stinky mouths…hurrying? Hurrying to Zhaoqing to send someone off to their death?"</p>
<p>Fifth Uncle cursed under his breath as he untied the mooring ropes. Third Elder was also gloomy-faced today, lacking any energy. He simply reiterated the Second Boss's instructions as usual, like a megaphone—</p>
<p>"This time, we'll be fine after unloading the goods in Zhaoqing. But we need to hurry. It's the seventh day of the month today, and we need to get to Zhaoqing by the eleventh. The return trip will be easy, so let's all put in a little more effort!"</p>
<p>He himself was the number one person lacking energy. The long pipe leaned against his knee, and he was too lazy to strike a match to light the bag of Old Farmer brand tobacco he had already packed. Even his eyelids were too tired to lift. He looked like someone who had been exhausted for seven or eight days, neither human nor ghost. Not to mention Old Seven, Zhang Tiebi from the Chenghuang Temple had told him earlier on shore that his luck was bad and he should beware of villains. He had been worrying about it ever since. Taking advantage of Old Gui's brief respite, he asked in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Can you guarantee a safe trip this time? Look—they've hoisted the typhoon warning!"</p>
<p>He pointed to the frightening typhoon warning indicating a hurricane was approaching the province. Old Gui ignored him, but Third Elder frowned and remained silent.</p>
<p>Rumors were spreading from the small steamer in front: It's not good to set sail today!</p>
<p>"It's the tail end of a wind coming from Hong Kong. This trip won't be easy. Who can guarantee nothing will happen?"</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? Jue Wei Long's rebellion is no joke. They say he'll turn a few somersaults in the sky, and the whole world will change!"</p>
<p>"We have to go! Everything is ready. If you're too cowardly to be afraid of death, we'll call someone else."</p>
<p>A cargo ship next door was also rushing goods to Wuzhou, and they were even more eager than us. We were all thinking: It doesn't matter whether we go or not. We're just working for them, and it's not our responsibility whether we make it on time. On the contrary, we were hoping for a big storm so we could hide in the provincial capital for a few days of fun…</p>
<p>Woo…</p>
<p>The long, mournful sound of the small steamer's whistle shattered our hopes. It was slowly starting to move, towing us three cargo ships that weren't willing to risk our lives, away from the docks. By this time, Bai'etan had turned into one or two small mountains. The wind stirred up waves, and the wind was mixed with a layer of yellow sand, making the river surface murky and difficult to navigate. The small steamer was risking its life. The somewhat reluctant and mournful whistle sounded like a funeral dirge. Everyone who heard it felt a pang in their hearts.</p>
<p>Old Seven stared blankly at me, wrinkles furrowing his brow. His nostrils were pinched with fright, and his lips were pale as if someone had pinched them. Sweat was beading on his forehead and the tip of his nose. His eyes were unfocused, as if saying helplessly: We're at the mercy of fate! A gust of wind slapped him in the face, and waves splashed all over him. His hair was soaked with water, and his skin was covered in goosebumps. At this time, I was also like a fool, my mind empty, yet wanting to think about everything. Old Gui and Fifth Uncle were working hard, putting in their best effort, because they were the most experienced. Third Elder was useless, as old as a chicken coop with no use.</p>
<p>The wind grew stronger and stronger. A few drops, unsure whether they were spray or rain, landed on us, causing us to shiver. The sky was getting so dark it looked like the world was truly about to change. The situation was already very bad. Someone next door was shouting hoarsely:</p>
<p>"Take cover! Take cover! You're risking the lives of your eighteen generations of ancestors! Take cover at Baixian Shell nearby! Hey, we're cutting the cables!…"</p>
<p>The ship sailed out of Bai'etan, and the sea was vast and empty, making it even harder to navigate. The ship was rocking like a baby's cradle. One of the cargo ships had broken its cable and was drifting backwards. We didn't know what to do. Third Elder, who was usually very calm, was also at a loss.</p>
<p>"Ah, ai—wa!…"</p>
<p>Followed by several chaotic screams, the small steamer in front had hit something. People were constantly calling for help. Then the towing cable jerked us violently. The ship tilted to one side, and half the hold was filled with water. The raindrops were falling thicker and thicker, stinging like arrows hitting our bodies. But we couldn't worry about that. Taking buckets, Old Seven and I hurriedly scooped water out. But somehow, before we could stabilize the ship, a warship with a white flag and a red sun on it suddenly rammed into us diagonally, causing waves that made our cargo ship even more unstable—</p>
<p>"Save—"</p>
<p>The terrifying scream was not completed before Fifth Uncle fell into the water as the ship tilted to the right. Old</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Gui calmly grabbed a thick cabin plank and jumped into the water, swimming vigorously towards where Fifth Uncle had fallen. But the waves were huge. I anxiously watched as Old Gui hadn't reached him yet, and Fifth Uncle struggled twice before disappearing from sight. Third Elder next to me sighed deeply. The place where we were standing was also unstable. The ship was completely overturned.</p>
<p>On the roaring sea, I clung to a wooden box, enduring a long, endless night under the onslaught of wind and rain.</p>
<h3>Nocturne</h3>
<p>— Liang Qiyun</p>
<p>I remember when the flowers bloom.</p>
<p>However, for me, that is now a flowing stream of the past.</p>
<p>The pavement after the light rain seemed a little muddy.</p>
<p>We walked along the moat.</p>
<p>The moat was full, carrying some withered vegetable petals and green grass slowly away.</p>
<p>Across the river at the bottom, the ancient mountain city outlined rough contours in the dim light of the night, so quiet. It was like an old man harboring contempt for the hearts of young people, and at the same time feeling the sadness of his impending demise, so he lay there helplessly, silently watching the sky. —The dark sky, no moon, a few stars timidly revealing pale, bitter smiles...</p>
<p>Due to my habitual night walks, I was familiar with my shadow. In the past, seeing that in addition to myself, there was also a slender, tall companion, I felt that everything was gentle and affectionate.</p>
<p>Shadows are always silent. We had passed many days in silence.</p>
<p>Now, it's gone! Both are monotonous and clumsy.</p>
<p>"Too lonely," I sighed.</p>
<p>Looking forward, in a place almost obscured by distance, there were forests spreading like mist, and behind the forests, high mountain shadows erected like curtains, the mountain soil, and a slender tower stood tall. It was a pity that it was night, otherwise, I would definitely run there to see if flowers were blooming everywhere. Has March in early spring really arrived? Why does the wind today still carry a cold chill!</p>
<p>"Young people shouldn't be like this." Minjun, my fellow traveler, my preacher, began our debate again. —Every time, every time, our arguments always concluded with his smug, triumphant laughter, and my boundless resentment. —He continued, "Losing a woman's love is not such a big deal. What's the point of being so melancholy! Other people, who have lost their homes, who have lost their countries, aren't they all about to cry themselves to death?"</p>
<p>The hateful preacher's face shook, shook in front of me. My chest suddenly filled with anger, regret, and annoyance. What use is this practically empty theory to me! I really don't want to pay attention to him. However, for the sake of getting angry, I quickly replied:</p>
<p>"This is my own business!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I know that... Then, what do you want to do?"</p>
<p>"What do I want to do? What can I do! Just endure the pain."</p>
<p>"'Endurance' is the worst thing!" he said contemptuously.</p>
<p>"Not necessarily. Under certain conditions, there is a minimum limit, endure as much as possible. —I believe this is reasonable."</p>
<p>"Ah, fool, you are completely wrong! Because—this is precisely 'a symptom of the submission of the weak.' No, no, you should—"</p>
<p>He almost shouted it out.</p>
<p>"But, think about it, even a dead volcano has a day of resurrection. What's more…" —Although I felt I had the right to add this sentence; at the same time, I also knew that this would not help the facts.</p>
<p>"No, you should straighten your chest immediately!"</p>
<p>"Yes, there will be such a day."</p>
<p>I smiled. Turning my head to look at him, he was also smiling.</p>
<p>So, we were silent...</p>
<p>After walking this straight pavement and turning into a narrower, muddier alley, I leaned over to his ear and said:</p>
<p>"Even dead volcanoes have a day of resurrection! Look, friend."</p>
<p>I remember when the flowers bloom.</p>
<p>I also remember when the flowers fall.</p>
<p>However, for me, is this really becoming a flowing stream of the past?</p>
<p>No, there is still sunshine tomorrow.</p>
<h3>In Front of the Temple of the Martial Saint</h3>
<p>— Zhi Fu</p>
<p>In the morning, a large crowd surrounded the Temple of the Martial Saint, crowding the front gate so tightly that not a drop of water could pass through. People stretched their necks, their gazes all focused on the brand new black-lettered announcement with a red circle around it.</p>
<p>"Oh! Repairing the Wanyuan Bridge!..." someone who could read shouted.</p>
<p>Then, those who had squeezed in returned, which generally would not elicit public agreement! People's faces, previously happy, now seemed to have an extra layer of displeasure. In that displeased expression, millions of complaints were about to burst out from everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>"In such a barren year, building a bridge, isn't it clearly wanting to take..." Zhou Datou was afraid of raising his voice too high, so he stopped there. Looking back, luckily, he hadn't been seen by the boss. He paused before adding the word "money" to complete the sentence, sticking out his tongue, making a face, and shrinking back under the shed.</p>
<p>..."Repairing the bridge doesn't really count as doing good deeds! If they have money, giving out rice... giving out porridge... that counts as accumulating merit!" Qian Laizi said those words well, clenched his left hand, and punched the air, hoping the crowd would praise him and give him a cheer.</p>
<p>"I'll never walk on that damned bridge in my life, I don't care about the accounting!" Then Zhou Datou added fiercely. After speaking, he turned around and ran east.</p>
<p>"Damn it! Wasn't it the last time they built that Daming Temple that Little Tumor Lord made a fortune..." Hong Ajiu, who was sitting on the stone lion, was drunk again today and talking nonsense:</p>
<p>"Good! Throw it away..." Qian Laizi kept up his efforts, preparing to fabricate a reason to defeat him.</p>
<p>Then, people were agitated, and most agreed with Laizi's words.</p>
<p>Cursing and shouting mixed together. Hong Ajiu, with some drunkenness, took the lead in rushing into the crowd and tearing down the paper, throwing it at his feet.</p>
<p>"Ah! Trouble is brewing! In front of the Temple of the Martial Saint, chaos has begun. Some are running with their heads in their hands, like dogs splashed with hot oil.</p>
<p>Gradually... someone ran to inform Tumor Lord of this bad news. He opened his eyes wide. He didn't even button up his jacket and casually took three tough guys with him, rushing to the temple. The flesh on his face was horizontal. One would suspect he was a hound who would immediately devour all the small animals...</p>
<p>"Humph! Building the bridge is my idea, who dares to make trouble! I'll make sure they suffer..." Tumor Lord panted, making threatening gestures to the crowd, his bright eyes targeting Hong Ajiu's entire body.</p>
<p>Hong Ajiu continued with his drunkenness, his angry expression undiminished, raising his thick eyebrows, showing his intention to retaliate against Tumor Lord, but in a flash, the three tough guys seemed to have understood the intention, rushed over and grabbed the drunkard, very easily.</p>
<p>Struggling was useless. Hong Ajiu's steps began to stagger, and white foam appeared on the corner of his mouth, like a lamb waiting to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>"Trouble! Ajiu has caused trouble..." The crowd did not go to help, only this weak cry, it was impossible to discern who said it.</p>
<p>The bridge still had to be built. Hong Ajiu was treated as the culprit and sent to the station.</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Yun Er</p>
<p>At the end of last year, someone initiated a grand celebration for three couples living together. At that time, no fewer than fifty or sixty people signed up to join, but somehow, this matter was cancelled invisibly.</p>
<p>Recently, I got an unbelievable but reliable piece of news, saying that three couples living together will hold a group wedding at the Lassus Dance School on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<p>The previously rumored three couples were Xu Xingzhi, Chen Luming, Tang Na, Lan Ping, Zhao Dan, and Ye Luxi. And now, the couples holding the group wedding, except for the latter two couples remaining the same, the first couple has changed to Gu Eryi and Lulu's younger sister.</p>
<p>Their wedding ceremony is very unique, probably involving the three couples jointly performing a play.</p>
<p>After the wedding ceremony, a dance will follow in the evening. Fortunately, everything is readily available at Lassus.</p>
<p>This piece of news seems very unbelievable, but the source of the news is very reliable, and it probably isn't someone playing a joke.</p>
<p>After the three couples, what is unforgettable is also "Tiger" Zheng Junxing. If Junxing takes his Miss Huang along, then he can very well join in a cameo performance. The reason for the cameo could be as a practice "best man" for the wedding, as a friend joining in the congratulations, or even as ××. Isn't that right, Miss Huang and my Tiger's "friendship" is rumored to be very "mature"?</p>
