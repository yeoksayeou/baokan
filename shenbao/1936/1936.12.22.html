<p>張氏舉兵叛國。刦持統帥。亦旣爲各方一致聲討之目標。實無庸吾人再爲罪狀之臚陳。第就縱兵殃民一點言之。卽可斷其無法苟延殘喘。蓋民爲邦本。權操無形。祇許維護安輯。豈容摧殘虐殺。先王起師動衆。大都以弟民伐罪爲言。周儒著書立說。列民於君人社稷之上。卓見所及。義無二致自是厥後。霸主迭作。揆其功緒所紹。首在牢籠人民。淫昏暴君。任情宰割。民怨旣沸。亡亦隨之。此爲史乘章著之事實。不勝吾人僂指而枚舉。更就其近者言之。革命以後。國體一新。民情發皇遠非昔比。其有違反民意之舉措。無不邅迥頓挫　失敗。項城以稱帝而殂。張勳以復辟而亡。降及直皖之役。張吳之爭民情向背。宛示諸掌卽以最近綏事觀之。有全國一致踴躍之輸將。乃能作前方將士之勇氣。卒使國軍連戰皆捷。漢奸氣燄全消。豈非已事之足資警惕者乎。國府奠定以來。揭虊中山先生之民生主義。銳圖與民休養生息。一方則努力遏阻苛擾。一方則極意尊重輿論。三令五申。誠意昭然。故能全國歡抃一致擁戴。以有今日統一之局面。今張氏一反政府仁恕之道。挾其個人利害之私。擾害地方。殘民以逞。遑論大軍雲集。卵石之勢懸殊卽就此一端言。已不難卜其前途之命運矣。</p>

<p>申報醫藥專刊「急驚風遇着慢郎中」  黃貽淸　　好的造化！　　可是是郎中的慢　還是病家請的慢？　　「急驚風遇着慢郎中」這句話，好像含有些怨天尤人的意味。實際做醫生的，除非不是科學醫，斷斷不會故意拖延的（因事延緩又當別論。那些到了一病入膏肓」，不可救藥的時候才覺得「郎中」行動緩慢，藥性緩慢的病家，究竟是「郎中的慢，還是病家請的慢，還要問個明白。若是由於病家自己請的太慢，　未怎能責怪「郎中」呢？　　害了不能傳染的病，醫生請的慢，或是來的慢，治的慢，坐誤良機，或竟致病人不得不終於」死，造化固然已是不小，若是害了傳染病，那末不治，更須傳給旁人，輾轉施染，流行成「疫一，造化可就越發大了！又就醫生個人的遭遇言，有時「郎中走運」，某種急性病症，因爲病家請的慢，病的危險期本已抵抗過去，竟能「着手成春」，「服」而瘳的，倒還間或有之。可是就公衆衛生的保障言，要杜絕一個傳染病的蔓延，也只能阻遏隔離以後的施染；在沒有給人家知道，給醫生診斷明白，給衛生官廳或衛生院所行施隔離治療的以前，所傳播出去的「病種，却絕無補救辦法，彷彿過了河的牛，這牛尾巴是拉不到的了。　　所以開口見喉嚨地說一句，別管是郎中」的慢，還是病家請的慢，無論何人，有了病，能够及　就診，必要時，馬上受醫院治療，總是對的。撑的不是傳染病，該如此；是傳染病，尤其應該如此（上海第一特區裏白色的救命車，敲着和救火車一樣的警鈴，疾駛過市，可十足表現這種情勢）。醫療的事，不比個人衛生，絕無常入自作聰明的餘地：當行出色，自然非趕快去請敎醫生不可啦。　　有人說，你別替醫界鼓吹吧！現在像我國內地各處，旣大都沒有公立的醫院，診所，衛生試騐所，衛生事務所，傳染病院，療養院的設立，無從靠牠實施免費診治，代行實騐診斷，處理保健·防疫，調養貧病，更沒有防病院的設立，無從靠牠切實給各團體防止癆的乘機卒發，更沒有田舍醫院的創設，無從靠牠切實給鄕村治病，給鄉村阻遏傳染病，更談不到防疫的緊急處置策劃，在地方上有疫病流行的時候，能設立個臨時衛生試駱所，急救醫院，病人居留所，以便從速診斷，普遍施醫，嚴密隔離。地方上偶或有一二醫生，又難免不因爲沒有實騐診斷的帮助，有了病症，單靠着兩隻肉眼，一雙手，幾件臨診用具，診斷不出什麼個究竟—假使事實上沒有這種困難，恕我胡說。那末便勸人家有了病就去找醫生，可大家有找處嗎？至於傳染病的要報告，要隔離，從前衛生部固然也曾經有法定傳染病的規定，規定某某九種急性傳染病，要强迫病家報告，但是否直到現在，地方上執行報告的機關在那兒呢？報告了以後，實施查勘和隔離事宜的入員又在那兒呢？　　哦！這話倒也不錯。原來我國地方事業，百廢待舉，醫事衛生上本來也還有這些問題，未曾解决——近年雖然有經委會衛生實騐處和各省市府在努力建設，努力推行，私人方面也曾有幾位鉅人長德，樂予輸將，或甘效奔走，捐建或募建着幾個醫事院所（像蔣委員長的建立漢口醫院，胡文虎先生的助建中央醫院，杭州市立醫院，上海市衛生試騐所，捐建汕頭，廈門，福州，瓊州，廣州各地醫院，張公權先生的捐建太嘉寶翳院，孔庸之，趙晋卿，顏克卿諸先生的募建上海中山醫院），可是風氣初開，只能粗樹楷模，總還談不到普及，更談不到能使全民受惠——哩！可是這又難道單是醫衛生界的責任末？戰時救護統制問題（下）  花新人　　各省市縣分會之組織法應與總會同，亦須與總會發生直接關係，並應由總會供給各項材料，總會應視情形而定，按人數多少，分配爲組，成爲救護隊每隊應以十人爲限，每十隊爲一大隊，各隊長及隊員除於救護治療經騐外，對於軍事訓練亦應明曉，大隊長及隊長隊員均應由政府委任，以便工作得能聯銷進行而每隊之組織應包括醫師護士各隊長人選則應視辦事之經駱與毅力爲準，不應以資格爲主觀，故護士亦可爲隊長，前綫救護隊之工作亦可大別爲二，卽最前錢工作者，爲移動性質其工作包括有「包紮使輕傷者能於包紮後，復上前方殺敵，有「救傷」使傷重者於包紮救護後能减輕痛苦，並負責運輸至後方，再則爲後方工作者，爲固定性質除作由前方運回之傷者治療外，並當負責運輸藥品供給前力，其職責繁重（詳細辦法及救護　組織工作當另文申述之）　　（二）訓練：組織雖健全然缺乏訓練亦難有效，吾國醫護人才共爲缺少，茲根據敎育部之調查全國畢業之護士只有六八八六人，按吾國四萬萬五千萬人口計算，則平均每六萬五千三百五十人有一護士，而全國訓練護士之學校有二一七處，公私立醫院只有三六〇處，按標準計算，每一醫院病床八十張，每一護士護理五人，則全國須護士五七六〇人，醫院之外，向有學校工廠及衛生機關，須用此種人者者亦多，但其中亦有因病及婚嫁而不能工作者，照百分之三十計算，則每年至多只有四七三二人，在外作實際之工作，若供給三百六十處醫院，則人數向感不敷者有九二七人，由此足證吾國護士人才缺少，若一旦前綫須用人員則將如何應付？此政府均常加以考慮者，故目前所迫切須要者卽爲人才之集中訓練，關於訓練方式亦可分析爲二部言之。　　（一）一般訓練：查近年來吾國各女中學校及女國民均曾受有軍事看護訓練，此種訓練爲時亦不過三月，所學亦有限，此種人員按經騐與學歷對於正式護理則尚談不到，但只能作一護士助理員耳（一二八之役上海各校女同同學均入軍醫院担任護士工作，筆者親兒女同學因目睹傷兵流血及死亡而害怕暈倒此爲事實亦足證經騐之欠缺耳），再此種助理員而言目前亦將供不應求用，故政府當繼續擴大訓練範圍，宜以救護一課，爲各女中之必修科，對於此種訓練之普及政府當責令衛牛署內之公共衛生人員訓練所辦理。　　（二）特殊訓練—此種訓練即按社會醫藥衛生設備之趨向及目前之環境而定，亦卽專爲曾受有較高之醫學衛生敎育之醫師與護士而設，年來吾國之男護士有一千四百七十七人，此種人員得之實不易，若再加以數月之軍營化學醫藥之訓練，則可率領助理員若干人赴前綫工作，自可收事半功倍之效也，對於人才與經濟均兩相得益，政府何不樂而爲之！　　救護工作亦如消防事業，不獨爲醫護界中人應知之更宜進一步深入民間，普及於人民，使人人均瞭解救護之法則，知防毒之常識臨事不亂，此時政府指揮亦較易爲，而前錢之傷亡率亦將逐日而减低耳。　　對於經濟統制筆者非理財專家，而對於經濟學亦無相當研究，故不能詳述之，但有二問題當注意者卽財力之來源與支配是也，若支配不得其法，供求又將不濟，對事業之進展定有阻碍耳，其他卽救護準備金之統制以免雜亂不相爲謀，此項原則當與政府統制金融法，爲一貫策略不多贅。　　結論—救護問題在非常時期中實爲重要，政府宜力加以統制，以免步驟零亂，於國於民兩相不利，故政府在此援綏高漲中應從速統制救護工作，整理救護機關，訓練救護入才，以備萬一，更望國人於熱烈愛國捐輸聲中請勿忽略救傷護病關於牛命安全之救護事業，此爲余草斯篇之原意也。　　一九三五，十一月脫稿於克復白靈廟之役。疾病常識問答  程瀚章　　（九十八）去勢和性器缺乏　　（問）什麼呌做去勢？　　（答）這是男子的睪丸受外傷成人工的摘出而致的一種症候。像從前君主時代宮中所有的太監，就是這類病態。　　（問）男子去勢之後，現出的症候是怎樣的？　　（答）這種去勢症候有有早期和晚期之別　　（問）早期去勢的症候怎樣？　　（答）凡在春機發動期前施行去勢手術的人，他一生就永遠沒有男性的性格，於是缺乏性慾，發毛微薄，聲音變高調；而全身身長却異常發育，脂肪也很發育，所以外貌很肥大。　　（問）晚期去勢的症候怎樣？　　（答）這就是在春機發動期後的去勢。身體發育並不受影饗，祇現性徵减退，情慾消失，陽萎等。　　（問）什麼呌做性器缺乏？　　（答）這是先天性（天閹）或後天性的早期患性機能不全。大都是因爲內分泌性的性器發育障礙而起。　　（問）性器缺乏的病狀怎樣？　　（答）這種性器缺乏的病狀，和去勢相像，也可分爲身體發育異常和脂肪發育異常。　　（問）性器缺乏的人，身體發育異常，有什麼特徵？　　（答）迅種病人，大都四肢細長，下半身比上半身爲長。膝外翻，而兩足底扁平　　（問）脂肪發育異常的特徵怎樣？　　（答）皮下脂肪沉着，尤其在腹部陰部和股部特別肥胖。　　（問）關於性慾方而呢？　　（答）都是沒有性慾的發生。　　（問）去勢和性器缺乏的治療應當怎樣？</p>
<p>Page 16</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊沒有兒女的人  里昂　　活像在做夢，戴紅絨球瓜皮帽的時代似乎還在眼前，而已做着兩個孩子的父親了。自己的父親在家鄕，同母親過着寂寞的暮年，我們弟兄兩個被生活的颶風吹在外邊，所謂「天倫之樂」是難得享受到的，每决父親的來信，總對這事表示着莫大的遺憾，一別入家都兒女滿堂的有說有笑，而我們老夫婦倆無聲息地坐在堂屋裏，老眼望着老眼，多麼凄淸，像是沒有兒女的人……」這些語氣的流露，往往會望着自己的孩子，從心坎滲出辛酸的悲哀淚。　　而他最近的一决來信，又特別提起了村上的容德伯，他的確是一個沒有兒女，沒有老伴的孤老人呵，據說就在這决惡性瘧疾流行中死了，沒有一塲經懺，沒有揑哭竹棒的孝子，沒有披麻衣的媳婦，沒有眞正落眼淚的人，由他的房侄草草收殮，當天埋葬了，冷淸淸的，「唉！這也算是一世人生嗎？這人生太枉爲了。」父親用重擾的句子在八行箋上嘆息着，從他嘆息的句子中，感到了沒有兒女的人的悲哀，這悲哀在容德伯自己，自然不在死後，而在生前。　　悄悄地，從悲哀的情感中，容德伯在我記憶裏復活了起來：　　是那麼一個忠厚的長者，八字鬚下面有着一張老像微笑着的嘴，顴骨很高，因爲肌肉太瘦削了，昏花的老眼深深的陷落在窅膛裏，是常年流淚的劇性沙眼。花白頭髮只有後腦一圈，他的大布長掛起了油光，袖子允亮的厲害，襯裏布衫是終年不洗的，在家裏的時光少，混在街上的日子多，他是東園茶室的老主顧，不和人多說話，刺蝟似的踡伏在靠爐灶的桌子上似有時痴呆呆的吸着旱烟，一些人都在背地裏稱他「絕屁股」，村上人家做喜事是不歡迎他的，好像他到了就要連累新娘子的生育，大家沒好臉給他。　　連他自己的親兄弟也結了怨，照他兄弟主張，把侄子立嗣給他，承替他的產業，幾决三番，可是都被拒絕了：爲什麼我一定要兒子，自己掙的產業，自己吃的苦，自己不會享受嗎，親生的兒女有時還要受氣，老來苦呢！」這是他所持的唯一理由。後來他給續把幾畝田地，不顧侄輩的阻止，賣掉了，速一塊坑厠的地基也變了錢，整天價混在街上吃羊肉，喝酒，抹紙牌，只要他認爲可以相信的人，借十塊八塊錢很慷慨。即使上當，亦不在乎。這樣，親房們都惡聲感氣的對他說：你死了想害誰」？　　「死嗎嘿嘿嘿嘿……閻王多留我一天，我就多享受一天，也是一世人生呵，沒有兒女，沒有兒女……唉，甚麼都是空，死就死，害得了誰！」他的回答老是這麼幾句。這是他看透自己身世的話嗎？那裏，我很明白的記得；二弟完姻的那年，他站在我家屎簷下對父親說過這些悽慘的話：老弟，你眞是前世修得的福氣，兩個兒子，大媳婦添了孫子，二媳婦又進門了，一家三代，三代……瞧我，年紀比你大，光光的一個人，要是前世不作孽，天也不會罰我到這地步。好，你老弟該想得明白，有子萬事足……」　　而現在，據父親的來信說，他是死了。　　我知道，他雖死，他那沒有兒女的遺憾却並未死去。家鄉是一個多麼古怪的地方，會奚落一個沒有兒女的人，會企圖佔持一個沒兒女的人的產業，會認他爲不祥。但是，有兒女，有後代的便怎樣呢？我父親不是有着兩個兒子嗎，却被生活的颶風終年吹飄在外邊，使父母做着「像是沒有兒女的人」。談言原料告罄紗廠被迫停車  劍平　　十一日我在「談言」說：百物騰貴不是好現象」，那不過是「一般奸商乘機壟斷，把必要的，甚至食糧，也「囤積居奇」，致使「米船到埠日减，米市漲風更厲」在那裏，我不過只拿食糧來舉例，證明「百物騰貴不是好現象」這一句話的正確性，同時指出目下「物價不斷上漲」這一畸形現象，是「人爲的」陰謀。但是，這樣的立論也遭逢了一些論客的非難，然而事實是最雄辯的，現在讓我再說如下一段也是由一般奸商「囤積居奇」，而引起的更悲慘的事實，來證明這確是人爲的」陰謀吧。　　十二日本報本埠新聞有這樣的一條新聞：歐美市場華絲價格低落後，上海開工之四十人家絲廠，均因原料告馨，相繼停工，昨日截止（十一日）恒泰，振祥等十餘家均已停工：東鄉，裕豐等則原料已馨，即日停工：至於尚開工的積餘等廠，預料一月底前，亦將全停。爲「原料告馨」而至被迫停車的新聞，我們雖會見過，但全數均「請謜停業，不願繼續開車，」却爲前聞　　紗廠旣爲了「原料告罄」而是「被迫停車」，那麼，原料又爲什麼告罄的呢？毫無疑問的解答，這又是奸商的奸計了。同版新聞中，我們看到這一决「原料告罄」的原因，雖然部份在「本屆江浙秋繭歉收，不敷開工絲廠之用」，但最主要還是爲了「一般繭商雖收購本年豐收春繭甚多，但因鑒於九十月間歐美絲市頗形起色，故均囤積居奇，不欲輕售」。那麼，由此我們可知此次「紗廠被迫停車」的原因，說是「原料告罄」，未免大有語病了。說得明白點：原料是有的，不過一般奸商冀圖「居奇」，不撈一筆大財不放手，所以才「不欲輕售」。那又怎能　是「原料告罄」呢？當然，我們也不能深怪一般廠商的，生意人自有他的生意經，蝕本生意是誰也不願意做的，我們不看：「據絲業界調查，上海洋棧內存繭，尚有一二萬担，如廠商向其採購，因其價昂，照現下絲市，决不能盈利。」那又怎怪得他們「情願停業，不願繼續開車」呢？　　原料，已經爲「居奇」者剝削了第一重，成本加重，使一般小工業者已負擔不起：但成貨的銷售，以及絲市，又「因投機商乘機活動，海外市塲，均見回跌」。一而再，再而三的給中間商人（當然我們不能忽略了他們的後臺老闆）的直接間接的剝削，又怎能不「不打自倒」呢？可怕的天津我國民營的紗廠先後被吞，已是前車之鑒，無論爲國家計，爲民族工業計，我們又怎能輕視了和忽略了這一可慘的事件呢。　　別人是依恃着他們在政治上的特殊勢力作掩護，而在「經濟提携」這一美名下，遂行一切「刀不見血」的亡我的計劃我們呢，疲弱的民族工業沒有强有力的支持已不待說，而一般只見「已利」的奸商，竟敢冒大韙的對自己的民族工業加以非法的殘殺，無論是否有背景，我們總認爲是「仇快我痛」的禍國的事。　　對我們的「先天不足」的可憐的民族工業的從事者，我們敢以竭誠地勸告：我們除鞏固我們的國防，是再沒有方法可以使民族工業在有保障下自由發展的。穀草  李軒　　近黃昏時，鉛色的被濕霧所蒙蔽的天，更形陰沉了。風發怒的撲過大野去，又嗚嗚地呌着捲來，鹽樣的雪沙像波濤般翻轉着，大地漸漸泛了白色，車站旁小朱紅房子也一個個地白了。風越刮越猛，電杆木不住發着急促的嗡嗡聲。附近有幾個被灰色的大圍墻抱着的媒棧，川阜般的煤堆豎立在冷空中，上面的冰雪一層層凍厚，雪沙隨着風掃蕩去，沙沙的發出響音。月台的背面是一片長長的凹地，靠東點有個龐大的穀草堆，凝伏在黑越越的夜蔭下，　　遠處亮着兩盞水黃色的車燈，兩輛牛車停在那裏，車上滿載着穀草，雪花在上而繽紛的舞着，已厚厚蓋了上層泳花，兩個趕車漢子，裏着長毛的老羊皮襖，蹲在那車後身，一聲不響的捧着黑磁瓶子喝酒，那鄉下地保跟矮胖子吃咕了半天，最後他不響了，胖子回轉身，用手拂了拂那肩頭細小的雪片，便說：　　「老弟我能讓你吃虧嗎」？　　不等回答就迎着橫掃來的風雪，向迷霧中透出一星燈火的小飯館奔去。　　木板柵欄被推開，低着頭，大步的邁着，沿了屋簷下高低不平的磚道，過了櫃房門，循着舊路，在一個飲馬的水桶旁邊，零碎的冰塊把他滑倒了。　　屋裏一個啞嗓子被驚嚇了一跳似的問：北歐的亞洲古民族  特　　上星期四日（十七日）本埠亞洲文會舉行學術演講，主講的是該會敎育科主任勞萊爾氏，題目是「斯坎狄那維亞半島的亞洲人前哨。」在人種學和地理學上都有些關係，並且足以表示亞洲民族自上古即有冒險遠征性。　　在北歐俄羅斯白海和西而大西洋之間，住着一種民族，名呌拉浦，」今人都稱他們是蒙古種。但是照種族生物學而論，並非純粹蒙古種。他們在有史以前，便由亞洲內地移至現在所居之地，因爲在歷史開始時，斯坎狄維亞的極北部便有這種民族了。勞萊爾氏曾用五彩幻燈表不這種堅苦耐勞的民族的性格，職業，習慣。據他說：住在北歐的拉浦人，現在還有二萬五千人，他們分居在北歐各國。瑞典北部共有五六千人，挪威共有八千到一萬一千人，其餘的散居在芬蘭和北俄。住在瑞典北部的至少已有二千年以上。他們是養鹿游牧民族，雖久處文明進化時代，仍舊維持特有的個性。這是半由於地理上的關係，因爲他們所住的地方，白種人是無一能忍受那苦况的。半由於瑞典政府竭力保持這漸漸消亡的民族，不許他們和白種人通婚，因着這個原故，拉浦入能够維持他們的特性和語言。　　拉浦人身段矮小，步履輕佻，慣穿雪鞋，他們的兩足，天生成適用這物。他們額低，頰骨高，頭圓，鼻平，眼晴頗小而黑，但非杏仁式。口闊，下　狹，頭髪黑，皮膚微帶黑色。他們的女子，面貌很美，但老的很快，到了四十歲便滿而皺紋，但從來不施脂粉。他們平時很歡樂，不過怕見陌生人，他們疑心多端，但是中心釋然後，却很友善的。　　拉浦人依賴兩種動物，一種是鹿，一種是犬。每個男女孩，都畜一犬。犬很强壯，能够右守鹿羣，夜間守衛允勤，遇有狠來擒鹿的時候，便大吠驚醒牠的主人。拉浦人因爲養鹿的原故，時常遷移居處，春季移居山中草地，秋季回至森林，卽在該處度冬。其中最富有者，有鹿千頭，值價美金二萬元，但普通者有鹿三百頭，便很快樂了。　　拉浦人沒有文字，沒有文化。他們不懂樂器，他們的歌曲，雖有神話的價值，但音調簡單，隨口成章，唱的都是關於森林，鳥獸，花草，和天然的景物他們的宗敎，本來是拜天然的物，現在大半信本基督敎了。他們人人身上都掛一把刀，吃物都用刀爲助。長冬無事，大都飲酒消遺。他們分爲若千部落，用所戴的帽子表示屬於那一部落。照現在的情形看來，長此下去，人口日减怕總有滅亡的一天吧。</p>

<p>「誰呀」？　　摔倒的這漢子很快的爬起身，撲打着粘得泛白的衣袖，一面回答着：　　「我，我，老爺還沒有睡吧」？　　「幹麼？掌櫃的進來吧」。　　掌櫃的拉開風門，幌着他那胖身子走了進去，他是個四十多歲大腦袋傢伙，進來後就哈哈地乾笑着，匟上是一男一女，女人的左手正給斜對面睡着的黃瘦子托住烟斗，右手用拇指和食指揑捻着籖子，對那黑黑的一粒鷄屎似的東西向斗門裏撥，等這瘦男人吸完一口烟，將一杯紅紅的濃茶嚥下喉嚨去，便說：　　「掌櫃的有什麼事」？　　「我只打算又摟着花靑睡了呢」。女人用白眼珠翻了他一眼便：　　「呸，偌麼大年紀，不臊」　　胖子笑着，臉上可有點發起燒來，就不再跟那土婊子開玩笑，正經的坐在椅子上，跟那個上面派來的收草員瘦子講：上午北召村地保送來的一千四百斤榖草，還求老爺過過秤收下。瘦子像沒那回事似的，吸了口烟，才慢吞吞地問道：　　「說是二千斤的，一過秤差了六百斤哪！」　　「差六百斤」，這大頭胖子把袖管挽了挽，伸出三個短粗指頭來：「補這個的水成不成？」　　「三塊？滾他媽的蛋！」　　胖傢伙把手收回去，又笑得路兒路兒的，講起道理來：　　「老爺你想想，村長白當官差？地保白跑腿子？」　　「不是那麼說，村長能只要二千嗎？至少得派每村兩千五百斤這里只送一千多來，他們想吃獨食！苦我，我是幹麼的？我回到營裏也有交代！」停停，他盤算了下，接着說：「至少五塊錢，差一個也不成！」　　掌櫃的出去了一會，再回來時，將五張鈔票疊折在一起，放到　上，瘦子瞅了瞅，便拿起隻烟來擲過去說：　　「給你，—什麼也難，上邊來公事要你們交三萬斤草，派我來收，可是沒一個村子送得够數，託人說說，貼點水，其實這點錢够幹什麼用的？（把那鈔票輕輕一按）」　　掌櫃是慣於逢迎的，就笑迷迷的「是」了幾聲說：　　「今年旱，四鄉莊稼都不好，草也不多，睡吧，朋天見」。　　走出屋門，側着身子把門關好，就走到雪地里，在院中牲口棚那兒，咳嗽了兩聲，不知跟誰說：　　「好大雪，明年麥子好收成」。播音特別節目　　雛聲社特別節目　　交通（一三〇〇）下午四時至五時一刻　　自術歌　鐵蹄下的歌女　　中華男兒　狼山瑤　　美哉中華　挑夫曲　　伏爾加船夫曲　運動會歌　　一日恭獻國家歌　揚子江暴風雨彈詞　　曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻開篇「驚愛」　　天淡風閒爽氣多，數行新雁半空過，忙　侍臣高力士，御園中洗掃費工夫，內園　色無窮景，到處池塘　箋荷，少頃報說　皇到，寵幸楊妃左右扶，無數桂花風馥都，有時鸚鵡自相呼，排開御宴花亭上，海味山珍滿席鋪，纖纖玉手捧金壺　君按板，妃唱歌，霓裳妙舞世間無，太眞跪進三板酒，天子含歡把御手扶，楊妃醉倒楊妃榻，一幅海棠春睡圖，見醉態醺容　膚了處，那曉得，歡喜未完愁已到，說安祿山兵變逞干戈，直逼京帥奈若何，大唐天下承平久，文武朝臣禦敵無，速令六軍嚴護駕，忽忽車馬走長途，暫避烽烟幸蜀都，可憐弱質如花女，玉碎香消一幅羅，片時賜死在馬嵬坡。　　何芸芳何琴芳「雙珠球」　　元昌（一一二〇）下午三時半至四時一刻　　開篇「廿四個節氣」（嵌戲名）　　西園花放又春天。二度梅開雨水連。驟變未歌驚蟄起。春分蝴蝶夢綿綿。淸明高放風筆子。穀雨西廂把翠茗煎。牡丹立夏花零落。玉簪小滿野亭前。夾溪芒種漁家樂。夏至人逢得意緣。小暑白羅衫著日。望荷亭大署對風眠。立秋和的長牛殿。處暑西樓聽暮蟬。飛彩園中臨白露。秋分拚桂月中仙。西風寒露金荷葉。霜降釐花白似綿。立冬暢飲麒麟閣。繡儒小雪點雙肩。鐵冠圖大雪紛紛染。冬至琵琶懶撥弦。　寒　掃松問路。雪盃圓共醉大寒天。白兎金鳥又一年。　　將賓初「三笑」　　新聲（一三八〇）下午七賓時至八時　　開篇「柴淮門招天下客」　　蝦逢淡水戲蚊龍。虎落平陽與犬同。林冲决配來橫海。柴進招留禮貌恭。這呌做。英雄到處惜英雄。、開懷暢飲香醪酒。忽然走入敎頭洪。他是。自謂生平多武藝。不把林冲放眼中。說配軍那有多略。想來必定藝平庸。林冲是，忍氣低頭來伏小。恐防得罪主人翁。常時怒壞小旋風。說敎頭呀，好漢還須惜好漢。你不可，禮貌毫無太不恭。洪師聽。氣洶洶。欲將本領壓林冲。這正是，螳臂擋車害　躬。歌唱　　現代歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）下午三時一刻至四時　　娥眉月　（陳筠）　　喜相逢　（莉莉）　　長記得　（莉莉）　　愛的化　（　影）　　早行業　（曼琪）　　蝶戀花　（徐燕）　　周協記（七六〇）下午六時一刻至七時　　西宮調　（　影）　　花生米　（曼琪）　　微微風　（莉莉）　　賣油條　（徐燕）　　挑夫曲　（陳筠）　　吹泡泡　（曼琪）　　爵士歌劇社　　新新（七八〇）下午五時一刻至六時一刻　　賓貴的幼年　（姚莉）</p>

Zhang's rebellion against the party and harm to the country, occupying Xi'an, and holding the commander-in-chief hostage, making presumptuous claims, such disloyal, rebellious, ungrateful, and unrighteous wolfish ambition is intolerable to both heaven and earth, and despised by China and foreign countries. The central government, for the sake of rectifying the steel discipline and laying the foundation of the country, can only quickly launch a campaign to destroy the rebels. Our division belongs to the military and should sincerely support the central government, be ready for battle, and annihilate this rebellion. However, due to the remote location and blocked transportation, we ask to request instructions from the central government nearby so that we can follow them.

<h3 id="e5">Shao Yuan Chong's Reason for Entering Shaanxi <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Hongwen, the representative of Yan Xishan, the Pacification Commissioner of Taiyuan, told reporters on the 21st that the reports about the inside story of Mr. Shao Yuan Chong's entry into Shaanxi were not detailed. I fully understand the reason why Shao entered Shaanxi. Two days before Shao went to Shaanxi, I met with Mr. Chen Zifeng at his residence to jointly discuss a plan to recruit and pacify several informal troops in Suiyuan who were under the coercion of bandits. These troops had long had the intention of surrendering, but because no one could speak on their behalf, they had no choice but to wave the flag for other bandits. Mr. Shao and I understood the intentions of these people, and there were many people who could be persuaded, so it was decided that Mr. Shao would personally go to Shaanxi to discuss the matter with Chairman Chiang in a serious manner, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort. After Mr. Shao entered Shaanxi, he met with Chairman Chiang several times about this matter, and Chairman Chiang agreed very much and had already implemented it according to Mr. Shao's plan. The detailed process and the names of the recruited troops are confidential and cannot be disclosed. On the 10th of this month, Mr. Shao planned to return south immediately after completing his mission, because before Mr. Shao flew to Shaanxi, he had to return to Nanjing from the southwest to deal with other important matters in Nanjing. However, because Chairman Chiang repeatedly persuaded him to stay, he could not make the trip. Unexpectedly, the Shaanxi Incident broke out suddenly on the 12th, and Mr. Shao suddenly encountered the rebellion and died. However, I have received news from the front that the troops that Mr. Shao had previously planned to recruit have all surrendered one after another. The current improvement of the Suiyuan situation is greatly related to this. However, Mr. Shao has already achieved success and died. It is so painful! (21st Central News Agency)</p>

He hoped that Long could take the time to go to Nanjing for a trip to discuss the best plan, but if he was too busy to leave, he asked him to send a representative to come. Long replied to He on the 18th, stating that due to the initial outbreak of the incident, in order to stabilize the hearts of the people, he would not go to Nanjing for the time being and had entrusted Huang Shijun to fly to Nanjing by plane and would send Gao Yinhuai to pay a visit and learn everything.

Advance day and night and besiege the rebels immediately, so that the chief culprit will be captured and the President will be rescued from danger. The fate of the country depends on this. I and the strong men of the capital have long been trained by the President, and we are deeply shocked and angered by this incident. We all have the determination to kill the bandits and vow to be your backing. I send a special telegram to congratulate you." (Telegram on the 21st)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) During the joint memorial week on the 21st, Yu Hanmou reported that Zhang Xueliang forcibly detained the President at a time when the national unification and bandit suppression had been victorious. No matter how he defended himself, he would eventually be abandoned by the people of the country. Therefore, after receiving the news, I and Chairman Huang were the first to express our opposition. However, based on observation at this time, three conclusions can be drawn: (1) Unifying against foreign aggression is the unanimous demand of the whole country; (2) Chiang is the center of unifying against foreign aggression and the leader believed in by the people; (3) Anyone who violates the demands of the people and hinders the leader will be abandoned by the people. We only know that the Three Principles of the People are the only doctrine to save China and that we must concentrate the strength of the whole country under the overall national policy and central leadership to complete the great cause of national revitalization. The current important work in this province is to protect the locality, maintain finance, prevent traitors, and protect foreigners. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) People here are eagerly awaiting the development of the overall situation in Xi'an. Officials held a meeting today and swore to be loyal to the central government in any situation. Today, Yu Hanmou issued a declaration stating that Guangdong Province is willing to do its best to support the central government and is determined to protect Guangzhou at all costs. He also said that the current work in Guangdong Province is nothing more than the following four points: (1) Protect the security of the local area; (2) Maintain the local finance; (3) Strictly prevent reactionaries; (4) Protect foreigners. It is reported that Zhang Yingmin, the chief of staff of Guangxi Province, has recently suspended his trip to the north and has returned to Guilin to discuss the political situation with other leaders of Guangxi Province.

<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe, who went to Shanghai on the 5th, has been there for half a month. Now, out of concern for Chairman Chiang's situation in Shaanxi, he came to Nanjing the day before yesterday.

<p>(Tokyo) Japan is still closely watching whether there is room for compromise between the National Government and Zhang Xueliang. Ambassador Kawagoe's mission to Nanjing seems to be to reiterate the opinions that Foreign Minister Arita conveyed to Ambassador Xu last Saturday. Song Ziwen's trip to Xi'an after Terna's return to Nanjing indicates that efforts to rescue Chairman Chiang are still underway, but according to observers here, the outcome of these efforts is questionable because there are fundamental points that cannot be accepted, so the path to compromise is blocked. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told foreign journalists that Ambassador Kawagoe's trip to Nanjing is not surprising, as Sino-Japanese negotiations have never stopped.

<p>(Nanjing) Since Zhang Xueliang led a rebellion with his troops in Xi'an and held Chairman Chiang hostage, many people's organizations and universities and colleges of all sizes have formed crisis response corps. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Zhou Fo Hai, the Minister of Central People's Training, who was kind enough to grant an interview and make the following remarks: The Xi'an Incident has shocked governments and people in all countries around the world. They all believe that Zhang Xueliang's rebellion and holding the leader hostage can only undermine our country's revitalization and increase the enemy's strength. All compatriots across the country and overseas Chinese, when the country and the nation encounter extraordinary setbacks, can recognize the crisis of the country and the nation and the importance of supporting the leader. Therefore, all people across the country are vying to be pioneers to eliminate the rebellion and rescue the leader. This phenomenon fully demonstrates the people's enthusiasm for loving the country and supporting the leader. As for the crisis response corps organized by people's organizations in various places, the comrades of the central government all believe that they are loyal and brave. However, military operations are currently underway on the front lines, and transportation is very inconvenient. Civilians in various places are rushing to the front lines, which may affect the transportation of military supplies.

Chairman Lin led the ceremony and gave an impromptu speech on "The Great Significance of the Central Government's Clear Order to Punish the Rebels." The ceremony concluded at 10:30 a.m. (21st Central Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin reported at the National Government Memorial Week on the morning of the 21st, entitled "The Greatest Significance of the Central Government's Clear Order to Punish the Rebels." The original speech was as follows: "The Xi'an Incident occurred last Saturday and today is the ninth day. You can all see the course of events in the newspapers, so there is no need for me to report them again. What I want to report to you today is why the Central Government resolutely and decisively issued a clear order to punish the rebels. Speaking of this reason, it is actually very clear. First, from the perspective of our Party, the rebel Zhang Xueliang was originally a Party member. He should have obeyed Party discipline and Party principles. His actions should have been loyal to the Party and loyal to the ideology. The Central Government ordered him to take charge of the work of suppressing the bandits. He should have, under the command of the Central Government, supervised and led his troops to completely wipe out the remaining bandits in the Northwest. Unexpectedly, over the years, he wasted a lot of the country's military expenses and consumed a lot of precious time. As a result, he was raising bandits and aggrandizing himself. Recently, he dared to violate the major policies repeatedly decided by the Central Government, colluding with bandits, and kidnapping the Commander-in-Chief, creating the unprecedented Xi'an Incident. Such betrayal of the Three People's Principles and harm to the Chinese Kuomintang is a crime that cannot be tolerated. In order to maintain Party principles and Party discipline, the Central Government has no room for leniency towards such traitors. This is the first significance of the Central Government's decision to clearly order the punishment of the rebels. Second, from the perspective of the country, the reason why a country can be established, maintain national order, and maintain national unity lies entirely in the two words: 'principle' and 'discipline'. If a country has principles and discipline, the country can survive and maintain national security. If a country has no principles and discipline, the country will perish and will not be able to maintain all the order of national society. Therefore, principles and discipline are necessary conditions for the survival of a country. This rebel Zhang Xueliang committed treason and rebellion in Xi'an, kidnapping the Commander-in-Chief, and destroying the country's principles and discipline completely. In order to rectify the principles and discipline of the country, the Central Government has no room for turning back in punishing the rebel Zhang Xueliang. This is the second significance of the Central Government's decision to clearly order the punishment of the rebels. Third, from the perspective of the nation, every nation that can survive in the world has a basis for survival. Our Chinese nation has our Chinese nation's history, our Chinese nation's environment, and therefore our Chinese nation has our Chinese nation's basis for survival. In the current situation, our Chinese nation's basis for survival, simply put, is to clear the banditry at home and resist the powerful abroad. On the one hand, we must eliminate the remaining bandits in the country, and on the other hand, we must resist foreign aggression. These two tasks should be considered together. We must not focus on one and lose sight of the other, and we must not invite wolves to repel tigers. We must seek national self-reliance and national rejuvenation on this basis. Only then can our Chinese nation achieve the goal of true freedom and equality. This time, the rebel Zhang Xueliang, under the guise of resisting insults, colluded with the remaining bandits and spread heresies. If his rebellious plot succeeds, it would be a case of the wolves advancing before the tigers are repelled, harming the survival of the Chinese nation to the extreme. In order to safeguard the survival of the entire nation, the Central Government should severely punish the rebel Zhang Xueliang and have no room for tolerance. This is the third significance of the Central Government's decision to clearly order the punishment of the rebels. Fourth, from the perspective of morality, our late Premier Sun Yat-Sen vigorously advocated promoting our Chinese inherent morality. Among the inherent virtues of China, the four words of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness occupy the most important position. This time, the rebel Zhang Xueliang betrayed the Party and the country, committing treason and rebellion. He is disloyal. His father's revenge has not been avenged and the lost land has not been recovered. Instead, he took advantage of the normal and urgent time of the Sui War to turn to rebellion, creating an opportunity for the enemy to invade. He is unfilial. Because of a single thought, he made tens of thousands of children of Northern Shaanxi his personal sacrifices. He is unbenevolent. He is ungrateful to his superiors, repaying kindness with hatred. He is unrighteous. The people of the country are deeply indignant at this traitor who is disloyal, unfilial, unbenevolent, and unrighteous. The Central Government, based on the principle that all Chinese people can kill such a person, launched a major crusade. This is the fourth significance of the Central Government's order to punish the rebels this time. The above is my explanation today of the great significance of this decision to clearly order the punishment of the rebels. In short, the most important thing for the Party is ideology, the most important thing for the country is principles and discipline, the most important thing for the nation is survival, and the most important thing for morality is loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. The perverse actions of the rebel Zhang Xueliang this time are a betrayal of the Party's ideology, a destruction of the country's principles and discipline, a harm to the nation's survival, and a lack of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness. They are resented by the world and abandoned by all. Not only should the Central Government issue a clear order to punish him, but all Chinese people should beat the drums and attack him, and should rise up to punish him, so that justice can be extended, the source of chaos can be eliminated, and traitors and rebellious sons will be frightened and lose their souls, so that there will be no second Zhang Xueliang. This is the hope for the future of the country and the nation. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Kang Shibi said that the military period in Bailingmiao has passed, the markets have been restored, and the fleeing lamas have returned to the temple one after another. The bandits have suffered two惨 defeats and there are few remaining, so there is absolutely no possibility of re-offending. Moreover, the defenses built by the National Army in that area are extremely solid, so even if they attack again, they can cope with ease. Therefore, the Mongolian people are very at ease. Yun Wangfu is only dozens of miles away from Bailingmiao, and it only takes half an hour by car, so he can go to the temple at any time. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The hearts of the people of Tianjin are gradually stabilizing, and they are convinced that Chiang is safe and will be out of danger soon, and that the Shaanxi Incident can be resolved. A certain financier in Tianjin said that the sudden outbreak of the Shaanxi Incident caused a slight change in the market on the 14th. The old head bills rose, foreign exchange became scarce, and public bonds fell. Various banks sold more than 10,000 yuan each of British pounds and US dollars within a day. After the 15th, it gradually stabilized. Various banks originally planned to hold a meeting to prepare emergency measures, but in recent days, the management has been as usual. Public bonds are only a few yuan lower than before. Since the banks have not experienced withdrawals or transfers to other banks, all kinds of buying and selling in the market are as before. This is indeed an unprecedented event. This is enough to prove that the people of the country are eager to love the country and have the ability to calm down, which is far from what it used to be. At present, except for the textile industry, which is slightly affected, there are no other losses. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e26">Ministry of Railways Signs a 40 Million Loan Contract with German Merchants to Construct the Hunan-Guizhou Railway and Repair the Yellow River Bridge <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to raise funds for the construction of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway and the repair of the Pinghan Yellow River Railway Bridge, the Ministry of Railways specially negotiated with German merchants Otto Wolff and others on the method of borrowing materials. Negotiations began in the spring and a preliminary contract was signed. After consultations with various parties, the purchase contract was finally agreed upon recently and formally signed after being approved by the government. The total amount of the material loan is 40 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%. Of this amount, 30 million yuan will be used for the construction of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, and the remaining 10 million yuan will be used for the repair of the Pinghan Yellow River Railway Bridge. The repayment period is ten years for the 30 million yuan for the Hunan-Guizhou Railway and twelve years for the 10 million yuan for the Pinghan Railway. The material loan will be secured by the future property and income of the railway, and the German side will entrust the Bank of China as the trustee, with detailed provisions regarding the exercise of the mortgage rights. The Bank of China will come forward to investigate. The Hunan-Guizhou Railway starts from Zhuzhou in Hunan to Guiyang in Guizhou, with a total length of 1,002 kilometers, and is the backbone of transportation in the Southwest. Construction has already begun and is expected to be completed in three years, which will be of great benefit to the progress of the national railway construction plan. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

The new railway line is an extension westward of the Nanping (from Nanchang to Pingxiang Railway), and that railway will be used as collateral for the 30 million yuan credit. This contract is the result of nearly a year of continued consultations following the preliminary contract established by both parties on January 22 of this year. (21st National Telegram)</p>

<p>— By Zhong</p>
<p>It is reported that Zhang Xueliang, in addition to betraying the party and the nation, also condoned soldiers and bandits, resulting in murder and arson. In the Xi'an area, the number of people killed is not small. To rectify the legal system, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has ordered the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court to instruct its subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation. After receiving the order, the Prosecutor's Office has notified all its subordinates to comply and has submitted a report for review. It is expected that those who disturb the people will be brought to justice, and the law will be sufficient to safeguard the foundation of the nation. As far as our observations are concerned, we examine the trends of the times, express our thoughts, and there are things we can say.</p>
<p>Zhang's military rebellion and kidnapping of the commander-in-chief has already been the target of unanimous condemnation from all parties, so there is no need for us to reiterate his crimes. But just focusing on the point of soldiers harming the people, it can be concluded that he has no way to survive. Because the people are the foundation of the country, and power is intangible. It is only permissible to maintain peace and order, how can they be destroyed and massacred? When the ancient kings launched wars, they mostly said it was to comfort the people and punish the guilty. Zhou scholars wrote books and made statements, placing the people above the ruler, the country, and the altars. The insights were consistent. Since then, hegemons have emerged one after another. Considering their achievements, the first was to secure the people. Tyrants, indulging in their desires, slaughtered at will. When the people's grievances reached a boiling point, destruction followed. This is a clearly recorded historical fact that we cannot enumerate. Furthermore, in recent times, after the revolution, the national system was renewed, and the people's sentiments were greatly developed, far surpassing the past. Any actions that violated the will of the people were fraught with setbacks and failures. Yuan Shikai died because of his imperial ambitions, and Zhang Xun perished because of his restoration attempt. Coming down to the Zhili-Anhui War and the Zhang-Wu conflict, the people's support was clear. Even looking at the recent Sui incident, the nationwide enthusiastic donations were able to bolster the courage of the soldiers at the front, and ultimately the national army won successive victories, and the arrogance of the traitors was completely eliminated. Is this not enough to serve as a warning? Since the establishment of the National Government, it has promoted Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood, and has earnestly sought to allow the people to rest and recuperate. On the one hand, it has worked hard to curb extortion, and on the other hand, it has tried to respect public opinion. Repeated injunctions demonstrate sincerity. Therefore, the whole country can cheer and support it unanimously, leading to today's unified situation. Now, Zhang, contrary to the government's benevolent policies, uses his personal interests to disturb the local area and indulges in harming the people. Not to mention the gathering of large armies and the disparity in strength between eggs and rocks, just speaking of this one point, it is not difficult to predict the fate of his future.</p>

<p>Argentina, the capital. The Pan-American Peace Conference has made significant progress in promoting cooperation among the countries of North and South America. However, the United States' desire for the American continent to declare strict neutrality in the event of wars outside the continent has not been achieved. Resolutions obtained in the last 24 hours indicate that most American countries agree to approve conventions related solely to the Americas. Argentina alone views the current conference as the foundation for world peace. Although the plan for a Pan-American International League has been submitted to Washington for study, most representatives here do not agree with it. The work of the various committees has come to an end. A plenary session will be held again today, and the closing ceremony will be held on Wednesday. Matters to be discussed at today's meeting include the review of the committee's report on the "Declaration of Solidarity and Cooperation among American Countries" proposed by a certain Central American country, and several other economic proposals. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Argentina, the capital. The Pan-American Peace Conference recently passed three important conventions. One stipulates that the signatory countries agree not to interfere in the internal affairs of other signatory countries. The second stipulates the establishment of a collective security system. The third stipulates the joint maintenance of peace. Today, the Peace Group Organization Committee of the Peace Conference passed a motion stipulating that countries outside the Americas shall not participate in the above three conventions.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the signing of the Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty, as a result of Ambassador Shigemitsu's meeting with Foreign Minister Litvinov on the 19th, it was decided to continue the meeting with Deputy Foreign Minister Stomonyakov on the 21st to discuss specific issues. The meeting on the 21st was actively requested by the Soviet side. It is expected that the Soviet side will actively propose some conditions, and it is believed that the outcome of this meeting will largely determine the future of the fisheries treaty signing issue. (Allied Press, 21st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Director-General Togo of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Chief Kase of the First Section, Chief Matsumoto of the Treaty Section, Officer Saito, Chief Ide of the Supervisory Section of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and related members held a meeting to discuss the Japan-Russia fisheries treaty issue. After the meeting, Director-General Togo visited Foreign Minister Arita at 6 p.m. to report on the meeting and exchange views. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Soviet Union should be obligated to conclude a fisheries treaty in accordance with Article 11 of the Japan-Russia Peace Treaty and Article 15 of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Treaty. Therefore, if the Soviet Union cannot sign the fisheries treaty due to domestic procedures, it should find a way to extend the validity of the current treaty. Under this view, Japan believes that the Soviet Union should extend the validity of the treaty to avoid the Soviet Union's delaying tactics. (Allied Press, 21st)</p>

<p>Vatican City. The Pope will broadcast to the world on the eve of Christmas, and it is expected that he will call for peace. (Reuters, 21st)</p>
<p>Vatican City. Regarding the Pope Pius XI's illness, rumors circulated yesterday that it had suddenly worsened, but this is unfounded. In fact, there has been no change. He is still resting in bed according to the advice of Professor Amidei, the doctor. This morning, he also summoned Cardinal Pacelli, the Secretary of State of the Holy See. There are now plans to specially make a chair so that the Pope can sit comfortably with his right leg straight when he gets out of bed during the day. However, this plan will only be implemented when the Pope's condition definitely improves. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>Vatican City. Officials indicated today that the Pope occasionally suffers from asthma and has some difficulty breathing, but his breathing is usually very smooth, and his body temperature and pulse are no different from ordinary people. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Japanese Navy Prepares to Conclude; New Pacific Treaty; Wants to Consolidate Naval Defense with Minimum Expenditure; But is also Prepared to Compete with Britain and America <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Washington Naval Treaty will expire on January 1 next year. The Japanese Navy's budget has reached a huge sum of 680 million yen. There will be fierce discussions in the current Diet session regarding military expenses, new military plans, and shipbuilding issues. Naval authorities, including Vice-Minister Yamamoto and Director-General Toyoda of the Military Affairs Bureau, are studying how to respond in the Diet. As a result, the following decisions have been made:</p>
<p>(1) The purpose of the Japanese Navy's new armaments plan is to build a navy that does not threaten or invade, and to implement the minimum necessary replenishment. If the Washington and London treaties continue to exist, Japan originally planned to implement a plan to build replacement warships starting next year, so naval spending will naturally increase. The budget for the first year of the treaty's expiration is not much different from the budget when it is in effect, and in fact, the actual amount is less than when it is in effect.</p>
<p>(2) The Japanese Navy's replenishment plan for the post-treaty era is by no means aimed at maintaining the same number of warships as the British and American navies. It wants to build a navy that does not threaten or invade other countries, and that is most suitable for Japan's national conditions in terms of quality and type of warships, with the least expenditure. Therefore, Japan has no intention of inducing competition. However, military preparations have a comparative nature, so if Britain and America take actions that induce competition, Japan may have no choice but to compete with them.</p>
<p>(3) The Japanese Navy intends to compensate for any deficiencies by organizing and training fleets, in order to secure national defense. Only then will there be economic significance to military preparedness.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the issue of limiting Pacific defenses, the Japanese Navy is prepared to conduct negotiations and conclude a fair treaty that adapts to the current situation in the Pacific. (Allied Press, 21st)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai decided on its policies for the 70th Diet session. On the morning of the 21st, it convened a joint conference of executives and members of the Policy Research Council at San'entei in Shiba Ward. Over sixty people, including Shimada and Hatoyama, attended. After Chairman Sunada delivered a speech, Kiyose reported on diplomacy, Kuramoto on internal affairs, Miyawaki on national defense, Kanemitsu on financial reform, Kimura on administrative organization, Tateshiro Takahashi on rural issues, Ryogoro Kato on small and medium-sized businesses and industries, and Kobayashi on social issues, from each department's special committee. After the report was unanimously approved, a general meeting of the Policy Research Council was held at the headquarters. Furthermore, Chairman Sunada stated the following in his address: "What I want to say during this deliberation is the recent diplomatic issues, including relations with China and Russia, which have suffered unprecedented humiliation in diplomatic history and are in a critical crisis. In August of this year, our party strongly urged the government to establish a national policy to adjust diplomacy as the foundation for a new administration, but so far there have been no concrete results, and instead, it has become a state of diplomacy that is humiliating to the nation. For the sake of the country, this is a matter of great concern. Japan lacks natural resources to cope with its vigorously increasing population, which is a major problem threatening the lives of the people. However, in order to understand this reality and maintain international peace, it is appropriate to seek a readjustment of world resources, and further promote the convening of international conferences, etc. I believe that this is the diplomatic policy of the Empire. In recent years, there have been strong proponents of economic alliances internationally, which have greatly sacrificed the interests of many ethnic groups in order to seek the survival of their countries, but this is using the unnatural operation of politics to oppress ethnic groups, and I am convinced that it has no sustainability. From this viewpoint, we will determine our national policy and advocate for it. In order to achieve this goal, I believe that it is necessary for the entire nation to have a great determination."

<h3 id="e45">The Future of the Philippines; The United States Should Actively Cooperate <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) At the Foreign Policy Discussion Group, Popp published a survey report today, arguing that the Philippines and the United States should hold business talks as soon as possible to reduce the risk of the autonomous government failing. Mr. Popp said that the Philippine government should increase tariffs restricting American goods and conclude trade agreements with other countries. However, even after the Philippines becomes fully independent in 1946, American businesses should continue to enjoy preferential rights. The State Department has indicated that it intends to extend the period of economic adjustment in the Philippines, meaning that regardless of any changes in the political status of the Philippines, the United States still intends to exclude the Philippines when concluding most-favored-nation trade agreements with other countries. As for the opposition from all parties in the United States to withdrawing from the Philippines, it is actually due to relations with Japan. It is said that political circles in the Philippines also privately support an indefinite extension of the autonomous system. The United States may find a way to have China, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other countries jointly guarantee the territorial integrity of the Philippines, and if it is violated, they will jointly implement sanctions. Otherwise, the United States must continue to maintain the independence of the Philippines on its own. However, the public naturally believes that since the United States has this responsibility, it should also retain some control over the internal affairs of the Philippines. If the United States' policy of isolationism progresses further, it may also completely abandon the Philippines. However, future relations with the Philippines will depend entirely on the United States' policy in the Far East. The achievements of the first year of the autonomous government show the enthusiasm of the Philippine people in supporting the government. The Philippine Constitution is well-structured, and if handled properly, it can serve as a solid foundation for democratic government. However, as it stands, it may become a rule-of-law dictatorship. As for the Philippine national defense plan, if the United States is at war with Japan, it may strengthen the United States' military strength, because the Philippine national defense is entirely a naval issue. At that time, the navies of the Philippines and the United States may restrain Japan and allow the United States to attack from the Aleutian Islands. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet leaders today announced the news that Spanish rebels had burned the Russian ship Komsomol, calling it "the most serious development since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War." The government newspaper Izvestia said that this provocative act cannot be discussed in detail because the truth is not yet clear, but the Spanish Fascist Party and those who instigated it behind the scenes cannot shirk their responsibilities. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) It was learned today that Soviet Russia may suggest that Spanish rebel warships be regarded as pirates, so that neutral warships can fire on them at any time. However, Soviet Russia is not planning to take any action before knowing the details of the burning of the Russian ship Komsomol. Official sources said that Moscow has received notification from the British Foreign Office, allowing assistance in investigating the truth of the matter and the whereabouts of the crew, but does not believe that Britain will agree to regard the rebel ships as pirates. It is understood that France, despite its relationship with the Franco-Russian Treaty, will also support Britain's position, so Soviet Russia may take action alone. (National Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Soviet cargo ship Communist Youth, which was carrying manganese ore from a Soviet port to Gangcheng, Belgium, on the 5th of this month, was intercepted and sunk by a Spanish Nationalist Navy warship in the sea off the coast of Spain. Regarding this matter, the Petit Parisien recently published a dispatch from a Moscow correspondent stating that Soviet relations officials believe that the nature of this matter is extremely serious, and the outcome will make commercial relations between the Soviet Union and other countries unsafe. The Soviet government is currently studying the possible impact of this matter and the need for revenge. (Havas, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) After the Soviet cargo ship Communist Youth was sunk by a warship belonging to the Nationalist forces off the coast of Spain, the diplomatic reporter of the Daily Herald recently published a commentary stating that "this incident is extremely serious, and the international community is also greatly disturbed. It is difficult to say whether the Soviet government can tolerate it without taking action. However, it is obvious that if General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist government, knows that the warships under his command have sunk foreign merchant ships without causing repercussions, then similar incidents will continue to occur endlessly after the Communist Youth. For this reason, it was suggested last night that the Soviet government should take two measures as a warning for the future: (1) send warships to the Mediterranean to escort Soviet merchant ships; (2) ask the British and French governments to come forward to assist in curbing this kind of piracy."

<p>(London) Regarding the issue of foreign troops assisting in the Spanish Civil War, the diplomatic reporter of the News Chronicle recently declared that German leader Hitler has decided to continue sending troops to Spain to assist the Nationalist forces in combat, despite the advice of the Army General Staff. The force consists of five divisions, totaling 62,500 men. It is also said that "a German diplomatic delegation sent to inspect the territory under the control of the Spanish Nationalist forces three weeks ago submitted a report to the German government, believing that General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government, has lost popular support and will be difficult to win without the support of a large number of foreign troops. Even after victory is secured, this foreign aid must remain stationed in Spain, otherwise the Nationalist government will still be difficult to establish." For this reason, the reporter put forward the view that the only solution is to clearly warn Germany and Italy on two matters: (1) If the two countries assist the Spanish Nationalist forces, it will inevitably lead to serious disputes with Britain and France; (2) This risky action by the two countries, even in the most favorable environment, will inevitably sacrifice a large number of troops and a large amount of money. It is best to change course. (Havas)</p>

The Nationalist army plans to launch a major offensive before the New Year, but it is heard that Madrid is prepared to deal with everything. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid In the past week, there have been extremely important military actions around the capital. A large-scale offensive by the Nationalist army on Madrid has long been expected by the general public and is now imminent. During the week, the Nationalist army launched repeated offensives from the village of Valdemoro in the south of the capital to the western suburbs of the capital, the Parque del Oeste, and the towns of Boadilla del Monte and Pozuelo de Alarcón in the northwest, in an attempt to cut off the road from Madrid to Irún. However, they were unsuccessful. According to the government army, the enemy launched repeated offensives at the above-mentioned locations, but were repelled, suffering heavy losses. It is estimated that in the battles in the above-mentioned locations, the Nationalist army suffered 1,500 fatalities, while the government army suffered 500 fatalities. The Nationalist army was blocked in the area from Casarrubios del Monte to Pozuelo de Alarcón west of the capital and was unable to advance. Therefore, they turned to launch a fierce offensive against Boadilla del Monte to contain the government army. The battle lasted for three days and nights without interruption. On December 15, the Nationalist army was repelled by the government army in the village of Valdemoro. On the 16th and 17th, they launched a fierce offensive against Boadilla del Monte, using artillery and aircraft to assist in the battle. However, the government army fought bravely and was unstoppable. Boadilla del Monte was originally a small village and has now been completely destroyed. The Nationalist army then launched offensives against the Parque del Oeste and the university area, but were also repelled. Currently, it is heard that the Nationalist army has obtained a large amount of supplies and is preparing to launch a major offensive on Madrid at the end of the year, launching a general offensive. According to the latest news, a large number of Nationalist troops have been concentrated in various locations near Madrid. However, according to military experts, the Nationalist army's current strength is insufficient to encircle the city of Madrid from the northwest and southeast. This can be seen from the recent movements of the Nationalist army. However, in the next few days, no matter how the enemy attacks, the government army will definitely resist regardless of all difficulties. The current defense of the city of Madrid is very solid, morale is extremely high, and military discipline and training have greatly improved compared to the past. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>

Although he was injured, he was still able to land the plane safely. The woman suddenly jumped into the driver's seat, pushed him out, and flew the plane away herself. Larimont also said that the woman did not explain the reason for the attack, but it is generally believed that this was caused by love jealousy. Although the plane only had enough gasoline for a 350-mile flight, the plane was not found after a night of searching. It was not until this morning that the mystery was completely revealed, because someone reported that a beautiful woman had crashed a plane in a field in the village of Selsey in Sussex yesterday evening. The woman identified herself as Mrs. Chabilu and, apart from a few minor abrasions, was not injured. She said that she did not intentionally land in England. The Versailles authorities have issued a summons, entrusted to the British Foreign Office for delivery, ordering the woman to turn herself in for questioning. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) The extreme Labor MP Sir Cripps recently gave a speech in Bristol, advocating that the various political parties of the British working class should unite. Although Sir Cripps did not explicitly propose the name "Popular Front", his intention was no different from the Popular Front, stating, "Capitalists are now concentrating all their efforts to support the National Cabinet. If the working class wants to gain political power, it must also concentrate its organization. This concentration should include various labor movements, such as the Labor Party and trade unions. All Labor Party members, Independent Labor Party members, and Communist Party members should jointly formulate a minimum joint political program. This joint political program is peace, civil liberties, opposition to war, and opposition to fascism." It is said that other people in Britain besides the Labor Party, such as General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress Citrina, also want to organize this political group and include the capitalist forces led by Sinclair (leader of the opposition Liberal Party) and Churchill (leader of the extreme Conservative Party). Now that Cripps has made this proposal, it shows that there are also many people in the Labor Party who have the same feelings. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The leaders of the Socialist League recently decided to unite the Labor Party, the Independent Labor Party, and the Communist Party to form a "Unified Front". The political reporter of the Daily Herald recently commented, "If this can be realized, only the Communist Party will benefit. If the 'Unified Front' is to be effective, it must ensure that all participating parties have a common belief and accept all major policies. If not, the parties will be outwardly united but inwardly divided, and there will be no possibility of lasting. It would be better to remain separate and respect each other." (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Labor Unity Party, which is located between the Socialist Party and the Communist Party, is planning to merge into the orthodox Socialist Party. The time of realization is probably not far away. The Labor Unity Party occupies six seats in the Chamber of Deputies, the more important of which are Sique, secretary of the Provincial Administrative Committee and the Aviation Committee of the House, and Ful, vice-chairman of the Mining Committee and secretary of the Social Affairs Committee. Regarding this matter, the Socialist Party organ "People's Daily" recently stated that representatives of the Labor Unity Party and the Socialist Party headquarters held a joint meeting yesterday and declared that the two parties are completely the same in fundamental organization. Therefore, the time for the merger of the two parties is now ripe, and it is expected that this matter can be finally decided in early January next year. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The Guangdong Construction Department, in order to develop the fishing industry, has, through the provincial government, earmarked five million yuan from rural reconstruction funds to handle the development of the fishing industry. The department is now proceeding to plan the development of the Shangchuan fishing zone and is formulating detailed plans. The fishing zone is located at the mouth of the West River, in Taishan County, west of Hengcui Island, and near Guanghai fishing zone and Yangjiang Zhapo, making it an excellent location for a fishing zone. The steps the department plans to take are to first investigate the various fishery conditions in the area, and to measure the area's topography and area, with a term of six months, with expenses of approximately twelve thousand yuan. The first phase of construction has also been decided: (1) the first section of the breakwater, (2) the first section of the fishing catch unloading wharf, (3) a weather station, (4) a fish warehouse, (5) a lighthouse, (6) a coal supply station, (7) a water supply station. In addition, an ice-making plant and cold storage will be established, requiring an expenditure of 200,000 yuan. The fishing zone will also be equipped with a fishing gear manufacturing factory, a net dyeing factory, a shipyard, a fish fertilizer factory, a canning factory, a radio station, etc., striving to become the premier fishing zone in South China. As active preparations are underway, its success is likely to be seen soon.</p>

<p>Zhangbei Dispatch: Since the Xi'an Incident, the remnants of bandits and puppets in Chahar, which were on the verge of collapse, have become restless again. Moreover, a certain party is watching from the sidelines, stirring up the dying embers and providing fuel, so that the flames of banditry are flaring up again. According to people from Jiabu Temple on the 18th, since the 12th of this month, military personnel from a certain party in Jiabu Temple have been shuttling between Jiabu Temple and Shangdu, negotiating with De Wang and a group of puppet bandit leaders, repeatedly deliberating on taking the opportunity to advance aggressively towards Suiyuan. In recent days, troops from Rehe have been advancing towards Kangbao, Baochang, Shangdu, and Nanhaogian, totaling more than 20,000 people, all belonging to the forces of the traitors Zhang HaiPeng and Wang Jingxiu. Furthermore, airplanes and tanks, which had previously been transferred back to Duolun by a certain party to prevent them from being destroyed by the forces that had defected, are now being continuously dispatched to supply the puppet army, supporting their encroachment. On the 16th, six trucks loaded with chemical warfare equipment were transported from Duolun to Jiabu Temple. Regarding military operations, a certain party convened a secret meeting in Jiabu Temple on the evening of the 16th, gathering De Wang, Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, Li Shouxin, Wang Jingxiu, and other traitors. It is vaguely heard that the main points of the resolutions are roughly as follows: (1) De Wang will remain stationed in Jiabu Temple to oversee the situation; (2) Bao Yueqing and Zhuo Shihai will be appointed as frontline commanders; (3) Li Shouxin will be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the front in Suidong (the rumor that it is Subei is incorrect), and all the puppet bandits, Mongolian and Rehe troops in front of Suidong will be under his control and dispatch; (4) a certain party will appoint another commander-in-chief to assist Li Shouxin, with the nature almost like the military supervisor dispatched by the imperial family in the autocratic era of our country; in addition, sixteen people will be dispatched to Li's staff headquarters to plan all military operations; (5) a request will be made to the highest leader of the forces at Koukou to quickly allocate airplanes and tanks to strengthen their forces, so as to launch a swift counterattack before the Xi'an Incident is resolved. On the evening of the 17th, De Wang and Li Shouxin jointly issued a large number of proclamations to the puppet generals and soldiers at the front, with absurd and outrageous wording.</p>
<p>As for the Rehe troops, more than 3,000 people have arrived in the vicinity of Guyuan and Gaohongyingzi in recent days and are advancing westward. Those advancing from Rehe towards Guyuan and Duolun continue to arrive in an endless stream. Two thousand troops under Zhang Haipeng arrived in Baochang on the evening of the 16th. More than 1,000 troops under Bao Yueqing, commander of the puppet 8th Division, also set off from Kangbao to the front of Shangdu early on the 17th, with Bao himself commanding in the army. One thousand Rehe troops under Wang Jingxiu, who had previously entered Zhangbei City from Duolun, had set off for the vicinity of Nanhaogian on the 16th. At the same time, four tanks were sent to that place and handed over to Zhang Wanqing to assist in the offense against Xinghe. At 8:00 PM on the evening of the 17th, Zhang Wanqing received the puppet side's general offensive order. Zhang immediately prepared to officially launch an attack from Nanhaogian towards Xinghe.</p>
<p>Now, it is the height of winter, and the climate outside the Great Wall is particularly cold. The fuel for the puppet bandit troops is extremely scarce. Therefore, since the army started, it has been difficult to obtain cooked hot food to ward off hunger and cold. The puppet bandits are therefore forcibly extorting from the people. Recently, merchants and residents in Kangbao and other counties are required to provide twenty catties of baked flatbreads or fried rice every day, which are continuously transported by trucks to Jiabu Temple and the front lines of Shangdu to be shared among the bandits. However, after arriving, the flatbreads are frozen, as hard as iron, and the bandits still cannot get their fill. As for the price given to the merchants and residents, each household is only given five corners, and at most no more than seven corners. The people's food is taken away, so everyone deeply hates the puppet bandits. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Fujian Province: All Troops Temporarily Under the Command of Chen Yi – Continued Active Suppression of Bandits <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Due to the recent Xi'an Incident, Chiang Ting-wen, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Fujian, was also detained. Therefore, the Ministry of Military Affairs telegraphed the Fujian Provincial Government to place the national troops stationed in Fujian temporarily under the command of Chen Yi. The Pacification Headquarters, located in Jian'ou, moved its staff office, led by Chief of Staff Miao Qingshan, along with the headquarters staff, to Fuzhou, where they will work in the Provincial Government to closely follow Chen Yi's instructions and handle official business. Regarding the suppression of bandits, it was decided to continue actively. In addition to the southwest of Fujian, which is fully responsible by the Fourth Route Army, the northeast of Fujian will be undertaken by the Pacification Headquarters, and the Pacification Headquarters will send one military supervisor and one political supervisor. One is to direct the troops to work hard to suppress the bandits, and the other is to publicize the crimes of the Red bandits in the garrison area, connect with the people, and report the whereabouts of the bandits at any time, so that the bandit suppression troops can have a target and easily make progress. Now, the largest bandit gang in northern Fujian, Huang Ligui's gang, has been driven by the troops from Nanping, Jian'ou, Shunchang, and Shaowu counties, and is trapped in the mountains on the border between Jianyang and Chong'an counties. In addition, the troops are searching very tightly, and food and ammunition are in short supply. They know that they cannot stand here and are planning to flee to Jiangxi. The bandit gangs of Xie Zuolin, Fan Tiemin, and Liu Ying in eastern Fujian have been dispatched by the 80th Division Wang Jixiang Brigade to Fuan Prefecture to encircle and suppress them in different ways. Now, there are no bandit traces in Fuan, Fuding, and Shouning counties. Chen Qi, the commander of the 80th Division, also went to eastern Fujian from Fuzhou the day before yesterday to inspect defense affairs and urge the troops to advance and suppress the bandits. As for the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Border Area of Fujian, Zhejiang and Jiangxi, Liu Jianxu, he has not yet taken office. The Military Affairs Commission has ordered the original incumbent, Zhang Fakui, to preside over the suppression of bandits in the border area of the three provinces. Regarding the amalgamation of the Provincial Security Corps into a Security Brigade, the first brigade commander, Chen Peiyu, and the second brigade commander, Huang Su, are scheduled to take office on New Year's Day next year at the Donghu barracks in Fuzhou, and the Security Office will hold a military parade and ceremony at the same time (December 19th).</p>
<h3 id="e65">Fuzhou Grain and Finance: Civil Affairs Department Formulates Measures for Adjusting Grain; Provincial Government and Chamber of Commerce Plan Financial Relief <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: In recent months, due to the excessive export of rice from coastal counties in this province, although the late rice harvest was abundant, rice prices have continued to soar, which will develop into a public food panic. Various groups have repeatedly petitioned the provincial government and the civil affairs department to find ways to prohibit it. Now, the Civil Affairs Department has formulated temporary measures for adjusting grain in this province and issued them to the counties for compliance: (1) The export of rice and grain overseas is strictly prohibited. If any smuggling is discovered, it will be confiscated in full. (2) The export of rice and grain out of the province should be reported to the local county government and forwarded to the provincial government for verification and issuance of a passport before export is allowed. When it arrives at the destination, it should be reported to the local county government for verification to ensure there is no mistake, and the passport should be collected and sent to the original procurement place government for investigation and forwarded to the provincial government for record. After these regulations, rice merchants cannot transport goods as freely as they did in the past, and the amount of exports has decreased slightly. Rice from upstream creeks is also coming in steadily. If the grain in the provincial capital can be slightly accumulated, the current selling price is expected not to continue to rise, or it may be slightly reduced. Furthermore, the Fuzhou Chamber of Commerce recently sent a letter to the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, inquiring whether the rice transported from Fuzhou to that place was re-exported overseas. Yesterday, the Shantou Chamber of Commerce replied, stating that "The food supply in Chaozhou and Meizhou has always been scarce and needs external assistance to maintain. Although the late rice has been harvested, it is still a poor harvest. The people's food needs still rely on external rice adjustment. As for the rice and grain handled, they are all supplied for domestic demand and there is no re-export to foreigners," and so on.</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident, although people in Fuzhou have been shocked, the financial situation is still stable. All kinds of banknotes are still in normal use, and prices have not increased. As for the relief of the city's financial situation during the Lunar New Year, the Chamber of Commerce previously requested the provincial government to borrow five million yuan from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank, with real estate as collateral, or to allow the issuance of commercial mutual assistance vouchers of not more than three million yuan for relief. The provincial government believes that the issuance of mutual assistance vouchers in the form of banknotes is related to the currency system and it is difficult to obtain approval. If it is within the scope of laws, regulations, and facts, it will do its best to help it succeed. Provincial government councilors Zhang Guowei, Fang Xueli, and Du Jundong were dispatched to discuss with Chamber of Commerce members Luo Mianhou, Hong Fasui, and Chen Peikun, and ordered the various merchant guilds to review the measures and submit them for verification. Now that the end-of-year accounting period is approaching, there are already some clues about the relief measures, and the various merchant guilds will be gathered for discussion within the next few days.

<p>Seven Russian thieves were arrested in Shanghai. It was discovered that they were planning to rob banks along the two roads, and detailed maps were seized, along with firearms and equipment for destroying iron boxes. The Bank of China in this port was also on the list of planned robberies. Previously, a Western detective, accompanied by one of the arrested Russian thieves, came to Songjiang to investigate. The bank identified that the thief had indeed come to withdraw remittances, and his actions were unusual. On the 21st, a Western detective from Shanghai brought another Russian thief to identify the bank. Subsequently, the bank's situation was photographed and taken back for investigation. According to reports, a person surnamed Mo behind the Bank of China in this port had previously pretended to go to the toilet and barged in to observe, initially arousing no suspicion. Later, when going to the bank to withdraw remittances, he also barged in and saw the iron box being opened and the money being taken away. According to the thieves' confession, they had identified the person in charge of the vault and the location of the vault. Fortunately, the case was solved in time, and no major disaster occurred.</p>

<p>The Suzhou-Wuxi Highway has been fully completed and will soon be open to traffic. It is learned that the right to operate the route between Suzhou and Guangfu has been obtained by the Su-Fu Automobile Company. As for the section between Guangfu and Wuxi, it was originally planned that the Highway Administration Office of the Jiangsu Construction Department would directly operate long-distance buses. It is heard that the method has been changed and it has been decided to be run by merchants. People from Suzhou and Wuxi, such as Liu Zhengkang and Mao Mujun, are raising funds of 200,000 yuan to organize the Suzhou-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company. They are currently in contact with the Jiangsu Construction Department. The idea is likely to become a reality, and traffic can be implemented in the Western New Year.</p>

It was originally scheduled to implement traffic within the year, but due to certain reasons, it could not be implemented. The opening has been postponed to the spring of next year. It is also learned that the Kunshan-Taicang Highway was originally handled by the Highway Administration Office of the Construction Department. Now, in order to achieve unity between Suzhou and Kunshan highways, the traffic matters of the entire Su-Zhen-Tai Highway will be organized by the Xihu Company. The Construction Department is currently negotiating with the Xihu Company.</p>

Currently, more than 50% of the taxes have been collected. The first installment of land tax has been fined according to regulations. Since the effect of the first general mobilization was not significant, in order to correct the arrears and achieve annual liquidation, the county government has formulated a second general mobilization inspection method. From the 21st to the 31st, it will be the period for the second mobilization. However, this mobilization will use the baojia system to check the preparations of each household.

<p>Since the Shaanxi Incident, the military and police authorities here have worked hard to maintain local security and have also made great efforts to stabilize the financial situation in the market. In recent years, unscrupulous merchants have taken advantage of the situation to manipulate the market and undermine finance. At a time of crisis and shock, when people are panic-stricken, they should be strictly suppressed to prevent disturbances. Recently, the Jiangsu and Shanghai banks in this port stopped lending money after the outbreak of the Shaanxi Incident. The authorities have separately advised them, and it is expected that they will resume normal financial operations within a few days. In terms of the financial situation, the local area is peaceful, and the stability is as constant as before. All banks are operating as usual.</p>

<p>National Products Industry Discusses Next Year’s</p>
<p>New National Products Promotion Plan</p>
<p>Establish a National Products Broadcasting Station</p>
<p>Hold Touring Propaganda Conferences</p>
<p>Wang Hanqiang, Xu Yunchan, Qian Zongjian, Zhu Gengtao, and other leaders of the national products industry in Shanghai, in view of the fact that although the national products industry has gradually developed in recent years under the enthusiastic advocacy of all sectors, the import of foreign goods has still increased year by year, indicating that the people of the country still need to be made aware of the promotion of national products. The representatives of major national products factories such as Dingxin Cloth Factory, Jiuxin Enamel Factory, and Taikang Food Company, including Sun Xizu, Le Fucheng, Chen Shude, Fan Tianjin, and Xu Chengde, gathered to discuss the national products propaganda plan for next year. After exchanging opinions, they decided (1) to establish a national products broadcasting station to specifically translate the advantages and market conditions of national products in order to introduce them to the people of the country and invite leaders of the national products industry to broadcast speeches; (2) to request the government to allow the widespread installation of glass display windows in public places in major cities across the country, specifically for national products manufacturers to display various samples for people to visit, so as to increase national awareness. This kind of equipment already exists in places such as the North Railway Station in Shanghai. (3) To unite 50 national products factories as the foundation and hold national products touring propaganda conferences, specifically traveling to various places in Shanghai and other cities to expand propaganda in an attractive way, so that national products can gain the loyal trust of the people of the country. The above three principles have all been decided. In addition to the first and second items, which are still in the planning stage, the third item, the touring propaganda conference, will be held for the first time in Shanghai and is already being prepared. The location has been surveyed and determined to be the Times Vocational Middle School in Caojiadu, West Shanghai. The opening ceremony is scheduled to be held on New Year's Day next year. The propaganda materials will mainly be for daily use, and other agricultural, mineral, chemical, and aquatic products will also be collected as much as possible. National products factories wishing to participate can contact the preparatory office of the association at Room 3, 3rd Floor, Ju'e Fang, Ermalu, Shanghai. The touring propaganda outside Shanghai will first be held in Nanxiang and Kunshan, and then gradually promoted in the counties along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway. However, it is still in preparation, so the opening date has not yet been determined.</p>

<p>Ineffective and Difficult to Ensure Safety</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Gas Masks</p>
<p>Many Inferior Products on the Market Are Shoddily Made by Various Merchants</p>
<p>People Wishing to Purchase Them Can Inquire at the Air Defense Association</p>
<p>Gas masks and other gas defense equipment are important tools for defending against poison gas, and civilians must have them readily available in order to deal with emergencies at any time. However, the products manufactured by general industrial factories, as well as imported products, are mostly simplified and shoddily made due to limitations in raw materials or technology. The effectiveness is low and they are of little practical use. The general public, only fearing the urgency of the need and lacking the experience to distinguish them, hastily purchase them without examining their contents, spending a large amount of money only to obtain useless equipment. The impact is not insignificant. Therefore, the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs has now implemented an inspection. Recalling the January 28th Incident, the manufacturers produced almost mountains of such products at that time, and the public purchased them enthusiastically. Later, after the Shanghai Air Defense Association collected and inspected them, it was discovered that these devices had no effectiveness at all. If the enemy had openly released poison gas at that time, and the public had only relied on these as the only means of defense, it would have been unthinkable. The past is a lesson. Unexpectedly, in recent days, there are even more of these inferior gas masks and equipment being produced. Not only are people wasting money, but the outflow of currency is also worrying. In view of this, the Shanghai Air Defense Association has reportedly submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban gas masks and various gas defense equipment that have not been inspected and stamped by the Ordnance Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs. At the same time, fearing that the public may not be fully aware of this, it has also published a notice in the newspaper to prevent the public from being deceived and increasing the danger. If anyone does not know the purchase situation, they can inquire at the association, which will be able to fully inform them and provide convenience. It is hoped that the citizens of Shanghai will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Xu Kai to Depart Tomorrow</p>
<p>for the League of Nations to Study Water Conservancy</p>

Mr. Hu departed earlier this month. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhang arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Mr. Zhang will start his trip in January next year because the procedures for going abroad have not yet been completed. Mr. Xu is scheduled to take the German ship Xianghuosi Tuo tomorrow to Italy and then to Geneva. Mr. Xu and Mr. Zhang's relatives and friends held a banquet last night to see them off. According to a reporter's investigation, Mr. Hu will study administrative matters, Mr. Xu will study water conservancy, and Mr. Zhang will study cooperative matters. They are sent by the National Economic Commission, and the expenses are all borne by the League of Nations. The study period is temporarily set at six months, and it may be extended if necessary. Twelve people have been approved by the League of Nations to be sent to study, so more people will be sent to study in the future.</p>

However, it did not mention how the funds could be remitted to Xi'an.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Association</p>
<p>Held General Membership Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Promote Acceptance of Bills of Exchange and Other Matters</p>
<p>Elected Luo Qinghua and Others as Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Industry Association held its seventh general membership meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 3 PM yesterday. Wang Yucheng from the City Party Headquarters, Fan Aiwei from the Social Affairs Bureau, Yuan Hongjun from the City Chamber of Commerce, and more than 250 members attended. Luo Qinghua was publicly elected as chairman. The meeting amended the articles of association and re-elected executive and supervisory committee members. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Luo Qinghua gave a brief report, saying that the association is holding its seventh general membership meeting today. According to the association's articles of association, a general membership meeting should be held once every year in mid-June. This year's meeting was postponed to today due to the National Assembly election. Since the establishment of the association, it has been more than six years, during which time the country has been in a difficult period, which has greatly affected the silk industry market. The economic situation of the industry has encountered unprecedented difficulties. In the spring of last year, the association created the commercial acceptance bill of exchange system in order to activate the use of funds. For several months of promotion, it has been deeply supported by the domestic economic community. After the government reformed the currency system on November 4th last year, the matter has been resolved. However, since the rampant smuggling in North China, a large number of smuggled rayon has been imported, which is a fatal blow to the silk industry. It not only affects national taxation, but also poses a serious threat to the industry. Now that the national crisis is becoming more serious, it is hoped that the industry will concentrate its efforts to eliminate internal strife and strictly inspect smuggling, so that the association will become brighter and more prosperous. Representatives from party and government agencies then made speeches, followed by amendments to the articles of association, discussion of proposals, and re-election of executive and supervisory committee members. The meeting adjourned at around 6 PM.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Xueliang's rebellion with troops, hijacking of the leader, and shaking of the national foundation should be condemned in the name of the general membership meeting. A telegram should be sent to urge Zhang Xueliang to repent and escort Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to a safe area. The resolution was passed. (2) According to the amount of money collected from the business leaders of each village, aid should be given to the soldiers fighting against the enemy in Suiyuan. The resolution was passed. (3) The resolution to amend the articles of association was passed. (4) Urge the industry to unanimously promote the municipal ruler. The principle was passed, and it was submitted to the next executive committee for handling. (5) Urge the industry to unanimously promote acceptance bills of exchange. The principle was passed, and it was submitted to the next executive committee for handling.</p>
<p>Elected Executive and Supervisory Committee Members</p>
<p>As a result of the election, there were 15 executive committee members: Luo Qinghua, Shen Qingsi, Pan Yisheng, Wu Xingcha, Suo Zuosun, Xu Limin, Li Yunjia, Li Wenzhi, Lou Fengshao, Wu Baoyuan, Shen Zicha, Yan Juqing, Niu Zhizhi, Pan Digong, Cheng Yansheng, etc. There were 7 supervisory committee members: Lu Zhengbing, Shen Qinzhai, Wang Tingsong, Niu Jiechen, Wang Shoushen, Cheng Yongliu, Wang Meisheng, etc.</p>
<p>Tax Bureau Explains</p>
<p>Tax Collection for Branch Stores</p>
<p>In response to an inquiry, the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance replied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday that the letter No. 1497 from your esteemed chamber stated that the Huoyou Industry Association stated in its letter of this month that Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the head office and its branch stores in the Republic of China, whose capital is divided from each other, should calculate their income separately. The meaning of the text naturally refers to the division of capital. From a systemic perspective, the branches belong to the head office or the head company, which is undoubtedly true. However, once the capital is divided, the operating rights are somewhat independent. It is also reasonable to levy taxes separately in the location of the branch store. However, many branch stores often do not divide the capital and only sell goods on behalf of the head office. In other words, whether there is profit or loss, the branch does not care. If the above situation occurs, should the same regulations still be applied to levy taxes in their location, or should the head office or the head company pay in total as a whole? Since the detailed rules of the regulations do not have clear provisions, the association is not very clear. Furthermore, although the branch store and the head office have a consistent organization, the brands are the same and different. It is not known whether there is any conflict. I would dare to inquire about two points, and I hope that your chamber will give an explanation, so that the association can forward it. Upon arrival, it was found that the branch store mentioned by the association only sells goods on behalf of the head office. In fact, the operating rights are not divided. The income tax should naturally be paid by the head office in total. This is a natural interpretation in accordance with the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations. However, for those whose name is a branch store, but the brand name is different from the head office, how should it be handled to avoid abuses? The Ministry of Finance is hereby requested to investigate and show a reply so that it can be forwarded, etc. As such, Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations stipulates that the capital of the head office and its branch stores, which are divided from each other, refers to the capital and business of the branch store being completely independent. If the brand name of the branch store is different from the head office, and its capital and business are not completely independent, its income will still be calculated together with the head office. The previous letter is hereby approved. The recipient is requested to check and inform.</p>
<p>The Yangtze River Rises Sharply</p>
<p>Shipping Routes Fully Open; Cargo Ships Operate Smoothly</p>
<p>The Thunderstorm's Merit Brings Joy to Shipping Merchants</p>
<p>Rose to Fifteen Feet Seven Inches Yesterday</p>
<p>The Yangtze River water receded, the earliest this year, and the retreat was also the most severe, once dropping to nine feet and three inches. The water level in Hankou dropped to two feet and four inches. Shanghai-Hankou ships could not go up the river after reaching Jiujiang, so Shanghai export ships could only load 20-30% of their cargo under the water level restrictions. At the same time, the boats and warehouses in Jiujiang were full of goods. The Yangtze River boatmen and shipping merchants were worried that the water level would recede further after the weather turned cold, and the shipping route would be cut off, and the accumulated goods waiting to be transported would not be able to be cleared. Unexpectedly, the weather changed unexpectedly. After the thunderstorm the day before yesterday, the Yangtze River water level changed dramatically, rising sharply. Yesterday, it was 13 feet and 7 inches, rising more than 4 feet in two days. This is the water level for the shallow sections from Jiujiang to Hankou. From Jiujiang to Wuhu, it has risen to 15 feet and 7 inches. The Yangtze River shipping route is fully open, and large cargo ships can be fully loaded with cargo and go directly to Hankou. Yesterday, the shipping merchants and the Yangtze River boatmen were overjoyed upon receiving this telegram. All the commercial goods that were accumulated in Shanghai, Wuhu, and Hankou due to the shallow water are now being loaded.</p>

<p>The Takahashi Rural Improvement Association</p>
<p>Requests the City Government to Pilot the Baojia System</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng Aims to Promote Local Undertakings</p>
<p>Orders Public Security Organs to Preside, with the Association Assisting</p>
<p>The Takahashi Rural Improvement Association, in view of the fact that the Baojia system is the primary plan for local autonomy, and since its implementation in various provinces and counties has achieved great success, Shanghai, although located in the economic and cultural center of the country, still lacks this organization, resulting in numerous difficulties when promoting local undertakings. Therefore, Du Yuesheng, the chairman of the association, submitted a request to the Municipal Government for approval to pilot the Baojia system in the Takahashi District. Once successful, it will be promoted throughout the city. The original memorial is excerpted below: "The Baojia system is the beginning of local autonomy, and since its implementation in various provinces and counties, it has achieved great success. Shanghai, located in the economic and cultural center of the country, should attach great importance to local autonomy and facilities for organizing the masses. Although Takahashi is located in the eastern rural area of Shanghai, after the enthusiastic efforts of local people in recent years, everything is waiting to be done. The implementation of the Baojia system is urgently needed as a basis for launching undertakings. The association has been engaged in the construction of rural Takahashi for two years, and deeply feels that the masses lack organization. Therefore, the rise and fall of an event cannot grasp the main points and achieve the effect of cooperation between the masses and the government. All organizations engaged in rural undertakings in Takahashi also feel the same pain of being uncertain and lacking a basis. Striving hard often achieves half the result with twice the effort. Therefore, we hereby state the facts and earnestly request your government to approve the pilot implementation of the Baojia system in the Takahashi District, and within a short period of time, instruct the local public security organs to preside over it. The association will also do its best to assist, so that we can see the success as soon as possible. If the public security organs are too busy with government affairs, and instruct the association to preside over it, we are also willing to devote all our efforts to serve our government and the local area. Is this appropriate? We hope that you will review and approve it so that we can follow it. It is truly for the public convenience. Respectfully presented to Wu, the Mayor of Shanghai Municipality."</p>
<p>Various Organizations</p>
<p>Telegraph to Condemn the Rebellion</p>
<p>Also Hoping Zhang Repents and Protects the Leader Back to Nanjing</p>
<p>Military Training Students Telegraph: "Director He, Nanjing. Zhang Xueliang, with the heart of a jackal and the nature of a wolf, rebelled against the country by force and hijacked the chairman. The whole country is resentful and condemns him in unison. We are willing to lead under your leadership, attack the bandit's nest directly, and protect the chairman. We swear to be irreconcilable with the chief culprit. Respectfully telegraph this, hoping for your consideration. Liu Lianyi, Military Instructor of Shanghai Hujiang University, Jia Disheng, Military Instructor of Attached Middle School, and all the military training students."</p>
<p>Aurora University</p>
<p>Attached Yangzhou Aurora Middle School telegraphs to the Executive Yuan: "Director of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Xueliang rebelled against the party and the country, hijacked the commander, deliberately sabotaged the overall situation, and his conspiracy was fully exposed. He heartlessly colluded with the communist bandits, and his extreme evil has been revealed. All our countrymen are filled with righteous indignation and feel the pain deeply, and think of ways to skin him alive and eat his flesh. Moreover, the national crisis is in full swing, and the border police are becoming more urgent. We are relying on the chairman to clear the enemy and recover the lost land. Zhang rebelled out of a sentimental illness, recognizing the thief as his father and coercing his superiors, willing to be a rebellious minister. He wants to trap the entire nation in a state of eternal damnation. Therefore, we specially telegraph to request a clear order to be given to suppress him in order to eliminate the rebels, quell the evil atmosphere, rectify the discipline, and extend the national destiny. We are extremely eager to see this happen. All teachers and students of the Attached Yangzhou Aurora Middle School of Private Aurora University."</p>
<p>Cihang Middle School</p>
<p>Telegraphs to all newspapers and compatriots across the country: "Zhang Xueliang, with the body of a lost territory, does not think of atoning for his sins and redeeming his past mistakes. Instead, when the national unification and the suppression of bandits and pseudo-regimes were proceeding victoriously, he hijacked the commander, rebelled against his superiors, colluded with the communist bandits, and attempted to subvert the government. His crimes are heinous. All our countrymen are deeply indignant. Skinning him alive and eating his flesh is not enough to uphold the national law and quell the rebellion. We believe that at this time of repeated internal and external troubles, it is time for the people to struggle hard. On the one hand, we should support the central government, quickly quell the rebellion, and rescue the chairman. On the other hand, we should continue to actively assist Suiyuan and recover the lost land. This is not a task for unusual people. Only all our compatriots can rise up and plan it together. Cihang Vocational Middle School Teachers and Students National Salvation and Suiyuan Assistance Association."</p>
<p>Physician Association</p>
<p>The National Physicians' Union and the Shanghai Physicians' Association telegraphed to Zhang Hanqing yesterday: "Mr. Zhang Hanqing, Xi'an: The national crisis is in full swing, and foreign troubles are becoming more urgent. Chairman Chiang, with his body connected to the safety of the world, is in the process of persevering in resisting the enemy and responding to changes calmly. However, you have used your personal desires to risk the disapproval of the world, rebelled against your superiors, and hijacked the leader. When the news came, the whole country was shocked and angered. You are a general who defends the country and bears the responsibility of protecting the nation. You have plotted against the country and trapped 400 million compatriots in a state of eternal damnation. This is called being unkind. You have received the special knowledge of Chairman Chiang, forgiving your past mistakes and entrusting you with important tasks. However, you have repaid kindness with enmity and are willing to sell your friends for glory. This is called being unrighteous. You bear the responsibility of suppressing bandits, but you have colluded with bandits. This is called being disloyal. You have forgotten the sound of killing your father and created a great opportunity for the sounders. This is called being unfilial. With one move, you have committed all kinds of evil. We do not approve of this. For the sake of the present, the only thing to do is to quickly repent, surrender, and escort Chairman Chiang out of danger. The government can stop the suppression, and the people can forgive your past mistakes. Otherwise, fighting stubbornly will inevitably lead to destruction. Time will not come again. Only you can quickly plan it. The National Physicians' Union and the Shanghai Physicians' Association."</p>
<p>Tongji University</p>
<p>All faculty and staff telegraphed: "The Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, the various ministries, departments, and commissions, the party headquarters and provincial governments of various provinces, the various military divisions and brigades, the various public groups, and the newspapers: Chairman Chiang's body is of great importance to the country and the nation, but he is trapped by Zhang and disgraced in Xi'an. All those with human hearts are indignant. The government declares justice to suppress him, and Liu Gu and other gentlemen bear the national command to attack and punish him, uniting the righteous army and attacking the rebellious masses. The difference between obedience and rebellion is clear, and the strength and weakness are different. Moreover, the trend of building a building is already established, and how can the land of a bullet be defended? Zhang has no talent like Zhao Kuo, but only the actions of Hou Jing. Drinking heads and burning stomachs is as easy as picking something from a bag. Washing his face and reforming is only possible today. If he can look up to the sky and be awed by his power, and make the soldiers not shed blood, and respectfully send Chairman Chiang back to the central government to preside over the national plan, it seems that Zhang can be allowed to rest and listen to his own destruction, or make contributions to atone for his past mistakes. We sincerely express our views for your public review. Weng Zhilong, President of National Tongji University, and all faculty, staff, and students."</p>
<p>Shanghai Organizations</p>
<p>The various provincial and county organizations in Shanghai issued a letter to the compatriots across the country regarding the Xi'an Incident: "Since the restoration of our country, internal and external troubles have become increasingly pressing. The territory is shrinking day by day, and the nation is in danger day by day. We are worried that the country will not be able to protect itself in the morning. Fortunately, Chiang Kai-shek, the only leader of our nation, has dedicated himself to the party and the country, and has maintained the overall situation, so that all 400 million of our compatriots love and support him. We are celebrating the unification of the country, and the prospects for revival are promising. It is within reach to stand shoulder to shoulder with the world's powers. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang is using the beautiful name of resisting Japan to summon the real disaster of national subjugation. He lost the Northeast with the policy of non-resistance, but he did not repent. He deceived the people with heretical slogans and launched a rebellion in Xi'an. He deceived the people and even betrayed the party and the country. Hijacking the commander, rebelling against his superiors, and disrupting the overall situation, he dared to risk the great disapproval of the world, lost his mind, and reached this point. It is precisely that the owl cannot live together, and the incense cannot be in the same vessel. All our compatriots should abandon him together. Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of our nation, has been working hard for ten years, striving for self-improvement, and this is known to all Chinese people. At this time of national revival and progress, he has suffered for the country. We must recognize the mission of the times, and those who undermine national unity and endanger the safety of the leader should be resolutely opposed. We urge compatriots across the country to unite and attack him in order to fulfill the national duty. We sincerely express this meaning and cry out loudly to inform the Chinese people. Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association, Hubei Fellow-Provincials Association, Sichuan Fellow-Provincials Association, Shandong Fellow-Provincials Association, Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association, Fenghua Fellow-Provincials Association, Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association, Shaoxing Seven County Fellow-Provincials Association, Dinghai Fellow-Provincials Association, Zhuji Fellow-Provincials Association, Changzhou Fellow-Provincials Association, Jiaying Five Prefecture Fellow-Provincials Association, Taishan Fellow-Provincials Association, Wuhua Fellow-Provincials Association, Xinhui Fellow-Provincials Association, Panyu Fellow-Provincials Association, Shunde Fellow-Provincials Association, Qingyuan Fellow-Provincials Association, Baoan Fellow-Provincials Association, Dabu Fellow-Provincials Association, Jiangning Six County Fellow-Provincials Association, Wuxi Fellow-Provincials Association, and other 55 organizations."</p>
<p>Also, a joint telegram was sent to Zhang Xueliang: "Mr. Zhang Hanqing, Xi'an: The incident in Shaanxi, hijacking of the commander, the news has shocked the world. You are wise and observant, why did you do this that the loved ones are sad and the enemies are happy? The matter concerns the safety of the nation, and we must sincerely express our final advice. Since the September 18th Incident, foreign enemies have been pressing on us day by day, and the survival of the nation is at stake. We rely on the unity of the whole country to complete the unification, and the good news of the victory in the Suiyuan War of Resistance has been repeatedly seen. Unexpectedly, you have not avenged your father, recovered the lost land, or avenged the national hatred. You have committed this act of rebellion, undermining national unity and increasing the national crisis. How can you face your father, the Northeast, the people of the country, and future generations? Therefore, although your actions are nominally for saving the country, they are actually harming the country. Nominally resisting the enemy, they are actually helping the enemy. This is one thing we must advise you on. Chairman Chiang has been running around north and south for more than ten years, planning and plotting, and has been loyal to the country, which is loved by the people. Moreover, you did not fight in the September 18th Incident, and Chairman Chiang was generous and did not pursue the past. Later, he entrusted you with important military and political tasks. His treatment was generous, and his expectations were earnest. It can be said that he has done his best. Now you do not think of atoning for your sins, but repay kindness with enmity, and suddenly hijack him. With a little conscience, how can you bear to do this? This is the second thing we must advise you on. In recent years, the people have been eagerly hoping for unification, which has become a consistent trend from top to bottom. Anyone who violates this principle will surely perish. The rebellion of the Fujian People's Government was quelled in less than a month, and Chen's light moves and reckless actions ultimately led to ruin. The previous events can be used as a warning. This is the third thing we must advise you on. We hope that you will consider the difficulties of the nation, respond to the demands of the people, immediately escort Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing, and telegraph your repentance to quell public anger and thank the people of the country. Otherwise, the righteous army will attack, and it will be too late to regret. Success or failure depends on one thought. We humbly express our sincerity and hope that you will consider it." (Signed by the same organizations as above).</p>
<p>Architectural Association</p>
<p>Telegraphed to Zhang Xueliang yesterday: "Mr. Zhang Hanqing: Since Chairman Chiang was captured, it has been a decade. The whole country is in pain. Although letters and telegrams have been exchanged to condemn him, he has not been enlightened. The people of the association have never expressed their views on national affairs, but they cannot remain silent about the leader of the revival of the Chinese nation being hijacked. At the time when national unification has been achieved and the national status has gradually recovered, you have dared to risk the unmentionable and rebelled against your superiors. We do not approve of this. We hope that you will escort the chairman back to Nanjing immediately, and you will not lose your status as an enlightened person. If the chairman is in trouble, you will have no day to die. We dare to offer sincere advice, hoping that you will consider it. The Shanghai Architectural Association."</p>
<p>City Muslim Association</p>
<p>Telegraphed yesterday to advise Zhang Yang to repent regarding the Xi'an Incident. The original telegram briefly stated, "When the news of the Xi'an Incident came, the people of the whole country felt uneasy. At this time of serious national crisis, at the critical moment of national survival, it is appropriate for everyone to be united, think with one heart, and work together to help the crisis. Even if there are any propositions, they should be legal and follow the rules, and wait for instructions from the central government before proceeding accordingly. How can we detain the leader and kill the officials, destroying the peace of the whole people? If we cause the people to suffer, it will be difficult for gods and people to tolerate it. We hope that you will stop at the edge of the cliff. It is not too late to repent in time. It is urgent to immediately escort Chairman Chiang back to Nanjing to preside over everything. The crisis will be resolved immediately. It all depends on your thoughts," etc.</p>
<p>After the Xi'an Incident</p>
<p>Northwest Intermodal Transport Interrupted</p>
<p>Goods Unloaded at Lianyungang Pier</p>
<p>Shipments to Shanghai Stopped</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, the traffic on the Longhai Railway was blocked, and the intermodal transport of goods from Shanghai was also affected. According to Section Chief Wang of the Intermodal Transport Section of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, due to the poor wheat harvest in the Northwest this year, a large amount of flour and rice was purchased from Shanghai. Currently, there are 14,000 to 15,000 tons being transported from Shanghai. When they arrived at Lianyungang, the Xi'an Incident broke out, and the Longhai Railway was interrupted. These grains could not be shipped to the Northwest and had to be temporarily unloaded in the Lianyungang warehouse. The warehouses are already full of goods to be shipped, and there is no way to store them. Therefore, the Intermodal Transport Section of the company, in order to take into account the losses of customers who are obstructed and delayed, has stopped shipping intermodal transport goods from Shanghai to the Northwest. It will be necessary to wait for the Longhai Railway to be fully open and the accumulated goods in the old kiln to be shipped out before continuing to transport them. As for the goods transported from the Northwest to Shanghai, they arrived in Haizhou before the Xi'an Incident and were waiting to be transported. The Hairen and Huahaiyun ships have been sent to load them.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Reports Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>Beat a Detective Sub-Inspector</p>
<p>Keming Beaten Unprovokedly on the Way</p>
<p>European Staff Express Indignation</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that on Sunday evening, Keming, a senior Chinese detective sub-inspector of the Huishan Police Department, was walking along Ward Road back to the Huishan Police Department after going to the Hongkou Police Station to work, when he was suddenly beaten unprovokedly by a team of armed soldiers of the Japanese Marine Corps. The time was 6:40 PM. Keming was walking alone in plain clothes. According to reports, the location of the beating was only a few steps away from the Hongkou Police Station. One armed soldier of the Japanese Marine Corps, wearing a steel wire vest, a helmet, and holding a rifle with a bayonet, struck Keming in the neck from behind. Keming turned around to defend himself, and another soldier confronted him with a weapon. Several soldiers rushed to help, all fully armed. The soldiers surrounded Keming and threatened him with rifles and bayonets. In the nick of time, a group of Chinese police officers walked out of the police station. Keming shouted in Chinese, and the Chinese police officers ran back to the police station to report to the European officer on duty, who dispatched Sub-Inspector Buck and a team of Chinese, European, and Indian police officers to Minhang Road to rescue Keming. Then he stepped into the Hongkou Police Station, and the Japanese soldiers retreated. Keming was hit several times in the face and made a report at the police station, stating that he had not provoked the Japanese soldiers, and they had suddenly beaten him for no reason. Keming did not want to go to the hospital to verify the injury and returned to the Huishan Police Department. It is reported that Keming was in charge of investigating the case of a sailor who was shot and killed by an unknown person near Bei'er Road on November 11th, accompanied by a Japanese hostess. The murderer has not yet been identified.</p>

<p>Western YMCA Basketball</p>
<p>Fudan vs. Chi-chih Final</p>
<p>University Group Championship Decided Tonight</p>
<p>The Western YMCA basketball games last night, each with a university independent group, were of little interest. John won against Nanyang with a score of 35 to 22. The match between the Xin team and the Hornets was once violent, and neither side showed much sportsmanship. The corruption of the Western YMCA referees is the biggest reason for the deterioration of the competition. The Xin team's score was originally twice that of the Hornets, but later one side relaxed its defense and the other took the opportunity to attack. The score gradually narrowed, resulting in a final score of 51 to 37, with the Xin team winning. Tonight, the Fudan vs. Chi-chih second confrontation in the university group will be the final for the group championship. The two teams have each lost once, with equal points. Fudan was defeated by Chi-chih in the first game of the Western YMCA opening, and should take revenge tonight. The schedule is as follows:</p>

<p>China Youth Swimming Pool</p>
<p>Charity Performance Competition Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Wonderful Program, Satisfactory Results, Women's Group Exceeded Expectations</p>
<p>The China Youth Sports Department, in order to raise funds for the Children's Paradise Association, held a charity swimming performance competition at the association's Sichuan Road swimming pool last night. The performers were all famous male and female swimmers in the city. After three months of warm water swimming training, their results have improved dramatically. Although yesterday's competition was a performance, everyone strived to do their best, especially the women's performances. The results were excellent. The performance began with a history of swimming evolution, explained by Mr. Peng Sanmei. Starting from the first attempts of humans to swim, relying on buoyant objects for support, gradually progressing to swimming across rivers without external assistance, the performance was divided into seven sections, detailed and unusual, attracting the attention of those who have not learned to swim, which was very powerful. The second part was modern swimming techniques, divided into four major categories and eight sub-items, all modern and cutting-edge styles. The third part was the beginner's swimming method, with Huo Zhenhong demonstrating various preliminary movements, how to make the body float, how to move forward, and how to breathe and exchange air, explained by Liang Zhaoan. Next was the 160-yard men's and women's relay, divided into two groups. Zhou Xiuzhen had the best start, leading by almost half a pool, but the third person, Lin Manling, deviated midway, allowing Lin Meizhen's group to catch up, resulting in Zhou's group failing. The next was lifesaving skills. China Youth believes that lifesaving is important and should not be undertaken rashly by everyone, so a lifesaving training class was established. The performers last night were mostly trainees, which was like a results test. Everyone had skills and was very proficient, attracting much attention. Next was the men's three-person relay, performed by famous masters, which was extraordinary. Then came water acrobatics, divided into twelve items, all very exciting and interesting, especially the slippery pole, dragon boat race, long-person swim, and apple swim, which were most captivating. The slippery pole was like crossing a single-log bridge. All the contestants took turns walking on bamboo poles. In the end, the Lin Manzhen and Meiling sisters crossed successively, while only Wang Zhongcheng among the men succeeded, and the rest fell into the water. In the long-person swim, the Lin sisters, Zhou Xiuling, and Liang Jinwen were divided into two groups, and their results were not weaker than the men's. In the water arena, Wang Zhongcheng for men and Zhou Xiuling for women were undefeated champions. The most difficult task was Zhang Rongguang's underwater swim, with one foot raised out of the water, the whole body and head submerged, and advancing on the back, which was very difficult. Huo Zhenhong's sea dog swim involved somersaulting forward in the water, imitating the sea dog's style. Zhou Ruiqin's bound hands and feet swim was also impossible for those who were not well-trained. The ninth item was the 160-yard eight-person men's and women's relay, which gave the contestants an opportunity to show their usual strength. The speed and posture were perfect. Then, the chairman of the conference, Ling Xitao, gave a report. In addition to thanking the visitors, he stated that the unfinished gymnasium of the association's Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association is now actively planning for construction, and a more perfect swimming pool will be established to promote the popularity of swimming. The association's Sichuan Road pool will also add a women's training class soon, and registration will begin soon. After the speech, there was fancy diving, with dragons soaring and tigers leaping, which was beautiful and breathtaking. Each contestant jumped twelve kinds of postures. Finally, there was a water polo match, divided into blue and white teams. The white team was stronger. Within a minute, Zhang Rongguang scored two consecutive goals, and Huo Zhenhong added another, leading 3-0. The blue team tried their best to fight back, and Zhou Ruiqin scored a long shot. In the first half, the white team led 3-1. After the break, Guo Zhenheng of the white team and Zhou Ruiqin of the blue team each scored two goals, making the situation equal. Then Zhang Rongguang of the white team scored again, ending the game with a score of 6-3, with the white team winning. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>White Team: Yu Zi, Lin Jinjiang, Guo Zhenheng, Huo Zhenhong, Zhang Rongguang</p>
<p>Blue Team: Chen Bao Yi, Lu Huijie, Zhong Shoujun, Wang Zhongcheng, Zhou Ruiqin</p>

<p>Charity Football Tournament</p>
<p>Donghua and Fashang Meet</p>
<p>This Saturday at Shen Yuan</p>
<p>Inviting Mayor Wu to Kick Off</p>
<p>The annual Charity Cup Football Tournament, this year the Shanghai Western Football Association, has invited the two major Chinese and Western teams, Donghua and Fashang, to participate. The date is the day after Christmas, this Saturday, at Shen Yuan. To show solemnity, Mayor Wu Tiecheng has been invited to personally kick off the grand ceremony and present awards. All gift tickets will be suspended. The proceeds from ticket sales will be donated by the association to various charity organizations in the city. This week's games include two Zilin Cup second-week games on Saturday. The league games include one each for the A group and reserve group, and two for the C group, all of which are less exciting. On Sunday, there will still be two Zilin Cup second-week games, three A group games, with Jinan playing Xishang, and one reserve group game. Donghua vs. Fashang is the most important. Although Donghua has already secured the championship with eight wins in eight games, winning against Fashang again would allow them to maintain their virgin status and win undefeated honors. If they are unfortunately defeated, it will not affect their championship prospects. There is also one game each for the B and C groups, and three morning league games, all of which are less exciting. The schedule is as follows.</p>
<p>Shanghai Basketball Association Three Games Last Night</p>
<p>Today's Games Postponed</p>

As a result, Huofeng won with 22 points to 20 in the first half. The Shanghai Basketball Association's three women's group games tonight have been postponed to the 26th due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>

Tonight, Ding Mingyi will face Mai Xueguo, with a handicap of 500 points. The two have faced each other once recently, and their skills and experience are evenly matched. This time, in the charity competition, they should be doubly serious and show their skills. After the game, there will also be a snooker match between Xue Yunrong and Max. Tomorrow night at 8 PM, there will be even more exciting performances. Since the billiards king Li Gongying went to Guangdong, the Portuguese Medina has risen to become the champion in Shanghai's billiards world. The only opponent is our country's master Zhang Yingda. For the purpose of donating to the Suffering Children's Paradise, they will personally compete against each other to compete for superiority and inferiority, seeking happiness for the suffering children.

<p>The Jiangsu Education Department produced a film on capturing and destroying pine caterpillars. The Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition Exhibition Period will be Held</p>
<p>The Opening will be Held until February 20th Next Year</p>
<p>The Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition hosted by the Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Library has been making greater efforts in recent days. The exhibitors who responded to the solicitation, such as the libraries of Peking, Zhejiang, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Yanjing University, the West Lake Museum, and collectors from various places, such as Ding Fuzhi, Zhang Jusheng, and Huifu An, all have fine works to participate in. The museum also held a solicitation and review meeting on the 20th. The attendees included Deng Xiaoxian, Jin Songcen, Pan Boshan, Pan Jingdeng, Peng Gongfu, Xu Weishi, Cheng Zhanlu and other ten people. After collective discussion, it was believed that the Wu Chinese Literature Exhibition in Suzhou was still a pioneering work, so it should be widely collected to promote culture. The original deadline of January 1st was too short and it was considered necessary to extend the exhibition period in order to live up to the enthusiasm of those who came from afar to visit and to enrich the amount of Wu Chinese literature. Therefore, the opening date will be extended to February 20th, and the exhibition will last for seven days. All the exhibits that have arrived will be properly kept, and the deadline for those that have not arrived will be February 10th.</p>

<p>Yarn Flower Speculation on Short Squeeze in Current Month's Yarn</p>
<p>The Situation in the Later Market Has Already Shown Weakness</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the situation gradually showed a hesitant trend. It is because the end of the year is approaching, and there is a period of closing accounts. In addition, some peers, because the price has entered a high level, are not indifferent to buying. However, the Osaka Sanpin yarn still rebounded high.</p>
<p>The Interest of Buyers Has Been Relatively Weak</p>
<p>The opening of the standard yarn market in the morning was because there were only three business days left in this month, and the delivery yards in the warehouse were not prosperous. Of course, there will be continuous unloads in the future, so the short-selling retailers hedged their positions. The market situation was still tight, and the prices of each month rose by 1.8 or 9 jiao to 2 yuan. After the second round, the Changfeng bulls closed their positions, and the market became looser and fell. By the time of closing, the Osaka Sanpin yarn rose sharply by 2.8-9 jiao to 3.9 yuan. The spot yarn price rose by 1 yuan, slightly rebounding. As a result, each month's closing price was higher than the previous day's closing price, with the near term rising by 1.6-7 jiao and the far</p>

<p>(Answer) If it is a congenital lack of genitals (eunuchism), there is absolutely no cure. If it is castration and acquired lack of genitals, testicular transplantation can be tried, and injections of testicular endocrine preparations such as Androstin A &amp; B, Erugon Spermin, etc., can be given frequently. According to my opinion, alternating injections of Androstin A &amp; B are more likely to achieve good results, especially for common neurasthenia caused by testicular endocrine dysfunction, which often has miraculous effects. (Note) This article refers specifically to men. Women who lack ovaries or have their ovaries removed due to surgery also suffer from a lack of sexual characteristics, such as cessation of menstruation, breast atrophy, and masculinization of personality. It is not difficult to draw inferences from one instance. The treatment, of course, should use ovarian endocrine preparations. (End) Discussion on the Nomenclature of "Tropical Diseases" (Middle) Little Soldier Considering the origin of the term "tropical disease," it probably originated in England after it acquired India. After becoming a colony, the British gathered various medical and health experiences they gained while operating in the colonies. They combined diseases that were unique to India with those common to both India and England. They attributed the causes to geographical and climatic factors and named them "tropical diseases." The famous London School of Tropical Medicine, as well as research and treatment institutions in Mumbai, Kolkata, Ceylon, and other places, are all venues for the advancement of this discipline. Following this, the Hamburg School of Tropical Medicine in Germany (founded by Mr. Koch) and the Batavia Institute for Tropical Diseases in the Dutch East Indies emerged. There are also specialized medical schools in various South American countries, such as the most famous Oswaldo Institute. Italy also has similar institutions. Considering their meaning and application, they are all for the purpose of understanding that knowledge of tropical medicine is the most important pioneer tool in the process of colonial development. Because when venturing into barren lands, it is necessary to prepare for resistance against the invasion of nature. At this time, the only assistance relies solely on medical and health facilities. Therefore, European and American countries that possess vast colonies in tropical regions all use national power to establish specialized institutions for treating and researching this discipline. Although there is no necessary requirement to specialize in this discipline during university medical studies, medical students, after completing their studies, if they are interested in serving in colonial health institutions (missionaries sent or volunteering to work in the tropics are also subject to this rule), must receive knowledge and work training in short-term courses at specialized tropical disease schools. They must also pass an examination and be granted a certificate before being allowed to serve. There are also universities that incorporate tropical medicine knowledge into the later stages of medical studies, such as the University of Tübingen in Germany (for missionary purposes!). Similar facilities exist in other countries, especially England, which need not be elaborated upon. Regarding the use of this discipline's name in various countries, the British Empire naturally calls it "Tropical Diseases." The United States follows the lead of its elder brother, which is self-explanatory. A part of Germany also calls it "Tropical and Maritime Diseases." However, some people call it "Exotic Diseases." This is obviously because they feel that the term "tropical disease" cannot fully encompass the meaning, and they want to use a more cautious and ambiguous term! However, when viewed objectively, it is felt that the use of these three words by European and American countries to represent the overall sum of this discipline already has sufficient justification from a geographical standpoint (except for South American countries). From a factual standpoint, these diseases are relatively rare (also excluding South America), which does not hinder the use of this term. Moreover, the roots of history and custom have already reached a considerable depth, and there is no need for reform whatsoever. Since the situation in European and American countries, the origin of the term "tropical diseases," is as such, let us turn our attention back to the Eastern Hemisphere and see what the situation is in Asia. Among the countries in Asia, besides our magnificent Republic of China, the one worth discussing is, of course, Japan. They absorbed Western civilization earlier, and their achievements are also considerable. We know that they are the best at copying, but here they did not blindly accept and imitate! Although they also have a tropical disease hospital in Kobe and an overseas medical affairs department at Keio University, these are not national institutions. There is also no specialized term in the curriculum of imperial universities. However, if we flip through their medical textbooks, we find a difference from the textbooks we use. In their textbooks, all so-called tropical diseases related to the East are sequentially incorporated. This method of extracting the essence and discarding the dross can truly be called rationalization! Emphasizing substance over name is the secret to Japan's success in absorbing Western culture! This is a clear example! I am not singing their praises; simply speaking from the perspective of position, environmental needs, and circumstances, the situations of China and Japan are identical in every way, so it is impossible not to make a comparison. If we carefully analyze tropical diseases, their main components are still infectious diseases, and parasitic organisms (including both animal and plant kingdoms) occupy the most important part beyond the scope of bacteria. Diseases caused purely by climatic factors are relatively few. At most, they become contributing factors with slightly different clinical courses. From a clinical point of view, the main field of tropical diseases lies in internal medicine. Decisively excluding skin diseases and venereal diseases, decisively excluding surgery, and other departments. Observing the above situation and for the sake of our own factual needs, at least I personally feel that we should obtain two viewpoints.

<p>Random Thoughts on Spring and Autumn (Infatuated Goose) Only with lofty ideals can there be a lofty life. Many defects of reality must be compensated by ideals. Many sorrows of life disappear in ideals. Many hopes of life are realized because of ideals. Ideals can enable a defeated warrior to run back onto the battlefield of life. Ideals can enable a heartbroken lover to be rebaptized in the river of love. Ideals can enable Sakyamuni to abandon his throne and go alone to the lonely mountains to practice asceticism. Ideals can enable Jesus to walk resolutely to the cross with unwavering composure. Ideals can enable Newton, Watt, Edison... to become scientists. Ideals can enable Tao Yuanming, Li Bai, Du Fu... to become poets. Ideals are the compass; when you lose your way, they point you to the light. Ideals are the beacon; in the vast sea of humanity, they illuminate your path forward. With ideals, one can ascend to heaven from hell. With ideals, one can jump into paradise from the sea of suffering. Our National Flag Yan Chonglou What we respect is our national flag. What we are responsible for is guarding our national flag on the border. The enemy wants to destroy our national flag and annex our territory. This conspiracy has been brewing for a long time, but we cannot let them do it, because the life of the national flag is our life. In the star- and moonlit night, our national flag flutters in the gale. We do not miss our parents in our hometown, nor do we yearn for a leisurely life. We lie in the trenches, holding our rifles in our hands and hand grenades on our chests. Although the fierce wind blows in our faces, this fierce wind, which would normally enter our nostrils, might stop our breathing, freeze off our fingers, and make us lie stiff and wait for death. But today, oh today, we have the courage to prepare for a decisive battle! We have a fire burning inside us! We do not flinch at all! We are not afraid of the cold at all! Each of us is a ball of flame! In the vast expanse of yellow sand, surrounded by nothingness, we have not slackened our spirits. We keep our eyes wide open. When we see the enemy approaching, we do not disturb them at first. When the enemy gets close, we fire our guns in unison. Then, some enemies fall to the ground, and some flee. Sometimes, our blood boils, and we leap out of the trenches. Regardless of how rugged the road is, we rush towards the enemy, upholding our national flag and marching forward! The national flag is our soul. We want to seek freedom and liberation for our soul. The national flag is in front of us, giving us encouragement and comfort. As long as the national flag exists, our spirit will not die. The Girl Without a Motherland Zhu Ying The rain was falling torrentially. Two rickshaws carried two lost souls of the city along a flat and dim road at night. One was me, and the other was my friend A Wei. I was specially accompanying A Wei to sightsee because he had discovered a miracle. It was said to be a noble lady from a certain European royal family who had just arrived from the United States, but she was now without a motherland. Not only was she young and beautiful, but she was also proficient in music, singing, and dancing. Therefore, as the wheels rolled along a certain road, I kept chewing on everything that A Wei had told me—according to A Wei, he had already been there three times, and this was the fourth time, because he wanted to consult her about music. Indeed, A Wei knew music. At A Wei's direction, the rickshaw puller turned a corner and finally stopped in front of a very old small Western-style house. He rang the doorbell, and a Chinese servant appeared from inside the door. When he saw A Wei, he said with a smile, "What a coincidence, Miss Tairoki just returned." A Wei nodded and led me straight to a bedroom on the third floor. Beautiful piano music drifted out melodiously. The sound of students' footsteps startled the music to a stop. A Russian girl, indeed very beautiful, came out of the room to greet A Wei and held my hand tightly, using stiff English to invite us into the room. After talking for a while, A Wei told her that he had brought a friend to appreciate her songs. As he spoke, he pointed to me. The girl smiled at me, then stood up abruptly, took out a violin from the cabinet, played it, and sang a small Parisian tune in a melodious voice. Then, she changed the tune and sang a Russian song. As she sang to the end, mournful notes jumped out with the strings, and tears couldn't help but jump out of her long eyelashes. But as soon as the song ended, she wiped away her tears and laughed again. During the conversation, I learned that she was only twenty years old this year. When she was five years old, she drifted to Paris with her parents. Then, her father died, and life became increasingly difficult. In the past ten years or so, she had experienced the hardships of the world. For the past eight years, she had been relying entirely on singing to support herself. She had wandered around New York, Chicago, and other places for three or four years, but she couldn't find a stable life. Recently, she had drifted to the Far East with her mother, like an autumn leaf. If she couldn't gain a foothold here, she might cross the sea to Japan again. The three hours quickly slipped away in wisps of cigarette smoke. I took out my watch and looked at it. The short hand was pointing to almost eleven o'clock, so I got up and pulled A Wei to leave. The girl suddenly brought her blood-red lips close to A Wei's ear, smiled charmingly, and said softly. A Wei smiled and said to me, "I'm not leaving. She said she'll find you a girlfriend to keep you company, how about that?" As he spoke, he made a face. I shook my head, put on my raincoat, and bid farewell to return to my residence. On the way back, I felt very empty in my heart, and I couldn't say exactly what kind of discomfort it was.</p>
<p>Knocking for Coregonus Nicholsii Luo Futing Knocking for Coregonus nicholsii, this unfamiliar method of catching fish, is something I only learned from my wife recently. It seems that the hearing of this fish favors musical sounds. Fishermen take advantage of this weakness, using knocking sounds to lure it into the net. Because the fish loves to listen to music, it mistakenly enters the net, thus losing its life. It can be seen that in this world, all things will inevitably lead to sorrow after extreme joy. But the person who discovered that this fish has an organ that likes to listen to music is no less accomplished than the Western musician Beethoven! Because there are many fishing households who rely on this method of catching fish to make a living. In the setting sun, when taking a walk on the motor road along the bank of Jiu—Xijiu in the western suburbs of Yixing—in addition to enjoying the leisurely scenery, we can sometimes hear a rhythmic, monotonous knocking sound, gently carried by the evening breeze. At first, people may wonder if it is a child on a fishing boat knocking for fun, or a signal to urge some kind of waterfowl to return, but after a few days, I saw the performance of this fact: that small fishing boat curved in from the small river mouth connecting to Xijiu, Boom—Ping Boom—Boom Ping Boom Ping Ping Boom Ping… Suddenly, the person paddling at the stern of the boat skillfully and rhythmically steps on a small movable wooden board placed on the boat surface. His technique of using both hands and feet requires considerable training. The sound of the knocking is very much like reading a seven-character quatrain poem when adjusting the tones, monotonous, weary, and sluggish. They don't ask whether it's spring, summer, autumn, or winter; whether it's sunny, rainy, snowing, or windy. They always spend their long years in this monotonous and weary life. When the wind and rain blow gray hair onto their heads, their age is soon aged by hard work, but their work is still a new beginning, as if destined in a previous life. If you hear this desolate melody on a drizzly early winter afternoon, a piercingly painful scar can immediately be imprinted on your brain—this is a miserable cry for survival!</p>
<p>Hearing that King Edward of England Abandoned the Throne for Mrs. Simpson He Tianjian A king's eyes see nothing of lasting value. He sees beauty instead of rivers and mountains. Is it that a gentle land can grow old? Yet observe that even an inchworm seeks to stretch. The royal crown cast aside, people's voices cease. Return to me, a small commoner under heaven and earth. Having obtained the meaning of Emei, why not test the truth of love for fun. The Patient Using an Iron Lung at Peking Union Medical College (Part 1) Bi Li Last spring, an American wealthy businessman from Chicago, Mr. Snyder, traveled to China with his family. After they arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Snyder and others boarded a ship northward, but Mr. Snyder's son and a friend took a plane to Beiping. The night before boarding the plane, he caught a cold. On the plane, he felt dizzy and unbearable. When he arrived in Beiping, his friend saw that his condition was not good, so he sent him to Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Two hours after arriving at the hospital, half of his body was stiff and unable to move. The doctor rushed to use an iron lung to maintain his breathing, otherwise, in another half an hour, his life would have been beyond saving, because his own lungs had reached a critical state of being unable to breathe. What exactly is the structure of this iron lung? It is an iron box shaped like a coffin. The patient lies inside the box, with only his head exposed. The patient's neck is surrounded by a very soft rubber ring. This iron box is connected to a specially made air pump. First, air is forced into the iron box—all the openings of the box are airtight—so the patient's lungs are also subjected to pressure and exhale; then, the air is extracted, so the patient's lungs expand due to the reduced pressure and can inhale air. The rate at which the pump presses and extracts is adjusted to be equal to the time of a normal person's inhalation and exhalation. In this way, the patient's lungs continue their breathing function under passive conditions. The side wall of the iron lung is fitted with two transparent membrane windows, and the doctor can look inside to see the internal conditions. There are also four pistons on the iron lung, and the doctor can reach in to move the position of the patient's limbs. The bedding inside the iron lung also needs to be changed; this is a very troublesome task. Twelve nurses need to work together to remove the bedding within three seconds. Because if the function of the iron lung is stopped for more than three seconds, then the patient will not be able to withstand the pain. After a quarter of an hour, the clean bedding is changed in within three seconds.</p>
<p>A Sojourn to Yan Hui's Former Residence Chen Jie —In the Humble Alley of Qufu— Yan Hui was the most admired of Confucius's three thousand disciples and the most virtuous of the seventy-two sages. Because he received Confucius's extreme praise, he was given the honorary title of "Assistant Sage" and was revered by later generations of scholars. Unfortunately, he did not enjoy a long life and died young in his youth. Confucius felt infinite sorrow at the death of this outstanding disciple. From the Analects, we know that Yan Hui was very poor during his lifetime. He lived in a dilapidated alley, but he did not suffer because of it and was able to maintain his joy as before. In Confucius's eyes, this attitude of being content with poverty was considered a manifestation of Yan Hui's virtue, and later generations of people who read the Analects also passed this matter down as a beautiful story. Where exactly is this humble alley? If you have the opportunity to go to Qufu, you can find its remains. Originally, on the way from the Confucius Temple to the Confucius Forest, there is a narrow street, just like the ordinary streets of Qufu. At the intersection stands a stone archway with the clear words "Humble Alley" engraved on it. On both sides of the street are scattered small, tilted houses and several bald thatched huts. It is said that this is the humble alley where Yan Hui lived in his time. Now that we see the true situation, it is indeed very dilapidated. But it is clearly a street, why is it called an alley? I think it is probably that the humble alley was the original site, which was transformed into a street after changes in later generations. There is also a temple of Yan Hui in the humble alley, with the words "Yan Temple" written on the door lintel. Although the architecture is not as grand and magnificent as the Confucius Temple, it generally has red walls and tall gate towers, which not only arouse solemn thoughts in visitors, but also serve as the only embellishment in this humble alley, adding a lot of color to it. The Yan Temple is worth describing in detail. In front of the temple gate is a very large meadow, interspersed with many ancient trees of unknown names, which grow very thick and tall. I don't know how many years they have been around. At a glance, they give people a sense of ancient times. Entering the temple gate, in that corner, you can see an ancient well, called "Humble Alley Well." The well is very deep, but the well water has long since dried up. Looking down, one only feels a dark darkness, unable to see anything. Around the well is a dilapidated thatched pavilion. If you sit idly on the railings of the thatched pavilion, overlooking this mysterious ancient well, and thinking about the scene of Yan Hui drawing water and drinking here thousands of years ago, how mysterious will you feel in your heart? In front of the pavilion, there is also a tree that is even older than the ancient trees in front of the gate. The trunk has cracked, and it may be destroyed by wind and rain at any time. Now it is tightly surrounded by iron rings, which complements the ancient well and thatched pavilion. If you go further into the hall, you will reach the main hall. Looking up, you can see Yanzi, who died young, sitting there solemnly, receiving the worship of future generations. Although he has no beard, in such a towering and grand temple, he also shows a solemn demeanor. Unfortunately, the tall temple was bombarded beyond repair by Zhang Zongchang's Zhili-Shandong army years ago. Now, part of the roof is exposed to the sky. It is pitiful that Yanzi's shrine has to be padded with a very thick and large bamboo mat, with stones pressing down on the four corners, which can barely avoid wind and rain. From this, we are sad about the inferiority of his fate, even after death he cannot peacefully enjoy a very good temple. At the same time, we deeply feel the odiousness of the warlords, who, in order to fight for power and profit, ruthlessly destroy thousands of years of historical sites. I don't know how many have been sacrificed, and it is not just the Yan Temple alone? It is said that there are currently no descendants of Yan Hui in Qufu, because there were no descendants left at that time. As for the annual sacrifices at the Yan Temple, they are presided over by local gentry, but they are only a perfunctory effort and do not have the solemn respect of the Confucius Temple's sacrificial ceremonies. This is also the bitterness of not having descendants!</p>
<p>Changing the Nest and Replacing the Phoenix Written by Zhang Henshui Episode 9 Pledging Hearts with a Cup of Water, Talking Wearily in the Green Light Hooking Fingers and Promising Love with Red Beans Guo Qi smiled: I'm just here to cool off. As the saying goes, a calm mind is naturally cool. I sit here without moving, so I don't need to use a fan, and it's still very cool. Old Mrs. Zhang said, "That's enough for today. Tomorrow, get up early and go for a walk. Sitting at home all day in this hot weather will make you sick." Guo Qi thought that although his mother's words came from love, he felt very depressed in his heart, so it would be good to go out for a walk. Therefore, he followed his mother's words and went out early the next day. A very annoyed person can occasionally feel comfortable for a while when suddenly walking from a room to a wide-open space. So after he came out, he didn't return home until ten o'clock. In the summer at ten o'clock, it was already halfway through the morning. When he walked back to the study, he saw a note on the table, weighed down by an inkstone. It was clear that a friend had come and left it. He immediately picked it up to read. It read: Cousin Wenjian: The item you entrusted has been forwarded. Mei Shi did not talk in detail due to other affairs. I will go again tomorrow to hear the reply. Brother left early in the morning for a walk. This is good exercise in the summer. I secretly like it, but I am ashamed that I could not accompany you. I send my best regards. Your friend, Mei Left Furthermore, Mei will return to his residence in the afternoon, or still pass by the gate of your mansion, where we can talk. Moreover: Mei will arrive at your residence around one o'clock, please wait for your cousin as I hope. At first, Guo Qi was a little confused when he received this letter. Later, after reading the two postscripts, he understood that he had left a note asking people to wait. Based on his personality, he is very enthusiastic. And since he volunteered to deliver messages between the two sides, he would be even more enthusiastic. The note says that he did not talk in detail. Probably there is something in these four words "did not talk in detail" that cannot be said face to face. In that case, just wait for him at home. Thinking this in his heart, he held the note in both hands and just stood up. It was at this time that someone asked in the courtyard: "Is Mr. Zhang back?" It was Li Youmei's voice. He answered through the window: "Miss Li, I'm waiting at home." Youmei laughed, "I came to try my luck, and this time I succeeded." With these words, he had already walked into the door. He nodded to Guo Qi and smiled, "Brother, you came back early. I came a while ago and talked with your mother for a long time." As he spoke, he took a seven-inch small flower fan and kept waving it in front of his chest. (113)</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement People Without Children Lyon It's like a dream. The era of wearing melon-skin hats with red pom-poms seems to be right before my eyes, and I'm already the father of two children. My own father is in my hometown, spending his lonely twilight years with my mother. My brother and I are blown away by the hurricane of life. It is difficult to enjoy the so-called "joy of family." Every time I receive a letter from my father, he always expresses great regret about this matter. "Others who left home with you all have children and grandchildren, laughing and talking, while our old couple sits silently in the hall, old eyes looking at old eyes, how desolate, like people without children..." These expressions of emotion often make me look at my own children, and from the bottom of my heart, seep out sad tears of sorrow. And in his most recent letter, he specifically mentioned Rong Deber in the village. He is indeed a lonely old man without children or a partner. It is said that he died in this epidemic of malignant malaria. There was no Buddhist service, no filial sons wailing, no daughters-in-law wearing hemp clothing, no one truly shedding tears. His nephews and nieces hastily collected his body and buried him that day, coldly and quietly. "Alas! Can this be considered a lifetime? This life is too in vain." My father sighed on the eight-line letter with heavy sentences. From his sighing sentences, I felt the sorrow of people without children. This sorrow, for Rong Deber himself, was naturally not after death, but before death. Quietly, from the sad emotion, Rong Deber revived in my memory: He was such a loyal and kind elder. Below his eight-character mustache was a mouth that always seemed to be smiling. His cheekbones were very high because his muscles were too thin. His dim old eyes were deeply sunken in his hollow eye sockets, caused by chronic weeping due to severe trachoma. His gray hair only circled the back of his head. His long cloth gown was shiny with oil, and the sleeves were particularly bright. The lining of his cloth shirt was never washed year-round. He spent less time at home and more time wandering the streets. He was a regular at the Dongyuan Teahouse. He didn't talk much to people. Like a hedgehog, he huddled at a table near the stove, sometimes blankly puffing on his long-stemmed pipe. Some people secretly called him "Cut-off Butt." People in the village didn't welcome him when they had happy events, as if his arrival would affect the bride's fertility. Everyone gave him unfriendly looks. Even his own brothers had grudges with him. According to his brothers' suggestion, they wanted to establish his nephew as his heir to inherit his property. Several times, but he refused each time: "Why must I have a son? I earned the property myself, I suffered myself, can't I enjoy it myself? Biological children sometimes make you angry and suffer in old age!" This was the only reason he held. Later, he even sold a few acres of farmland, ignoring the objections of his nephews, and even turned a plot of pit latrine into money. He spent the whole day wandering the streets eating mutton, drinking alcohol, and playing cards. As long as he considered someone trustworthy, he would generously lend ten or eight dollars. Even if he was cheated, he didn't care. Because of this, his relatives said to him with resentment: "Who do you want to harm when you die?" "Die? Hehehehe... The King of Hell keeps me for one more day, and I will enjoy one more day. It's still a lifetime. No children, no children... Alas, everything is empty. Death is death. Who can I harm!" His answer was always these few sentences. Was this his way of seeing through his own life? There, I remember very clearly; the year my second brother got married, he stood under the eaves of my house and said to my father these miserable words: "Old brother, you really accumulated blessings in your previous life. Two sons, the elder daughter-in-law added a grandson, and the second daughter-in-law also entered the house. A family of three generations, three generations... Look at me, older than you, all alone. If I didn't commit sins in my previous life, Heaven wouldn't punish me to this extent. Good, you old brother should understand, having a son is all you need..." And now, according to my father's letter, he is dead. I know that although he is dead, his regret of not having children has not died. The hometown is such a strange place. It will ridicule a person without children, try to seize the property of a person without children, and consider him unlucky. But, what about those who have children and descendants? Doesn't my father have two sons? But they are blown away by the hurricane of life all year round, making their parents "seem like people without children."</p>
<p>Factories Forced to Shut Down Due to Depletion of Raw Materials Jianping On the eleventh, I said in "Tan Yan": "The soaring prices of everything are not a good phenomenon." That was just "some unscrupulous merchants taking the opportunity to monopolize, even hoarding necessary goods and even food," causing "the number of rice ships arriving at port to decrease daily, and the rice market to see a more severe price surge." There, I only used food as an example to prove the correctness of the statement "the soaring prices of everything are not a good phenomenon." At the same time, I pointed out that the current abnormal phenomenon of "constantly rising prices" is a "man-made" conspiracy. However, such a proposition also encountered criticism from some commentators. However, the facts are the most eloquent. Now let me say another paragraph, which is also caused by the "hoarding and speculation" of some unscrupulous merchants, which has led to even more tragic facts, to prove that this is indeed a "man-made" conspiracy. On the twelfth, this newspaper's local news had the following item: "After the decline in the price of Chinese silk in the European and American markets, 40 silk factories in Shanghai have all stopped work one after another due to the depletion of raw materials. As of yesterday (the eleventh), more than ten factories including Hengtai and Zhenxiang have stopped work; Dongxiang, Yufeng, etc. have also run out of raw materials and will stop work immediately; as for the remaining factories that are still operating, such as Jiyu, it is expected that all will stop by the end of January." We have seen news of yarn factories being "forced to shut down" due to "depletion of raw materials," but it is unprecedented to hear that all are "willing to shut down and unwilling to continue driving." Since the yarn factories are "forced to shut down" because of "depletion of raw materials," then why are the raw materials depleted? The undoubtedly answer is that this is another trick of unscrupulous merchants. In the same issue of the news, we see that the cause of this "depletion of raw materials" is partly due to "the poor harvest of autumn cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang this year, which is not enough for silk factories to use," but the main reason is still "although general cocoon merchants have purchased a large amount of this year's bumper spring cocoons, they are hoarding and speculating because they are aware that the European and American silk markets have improved somewhat between September and October, and are unwilling to sell lightly." So, from this, we can know that the reason for this "forced shutdown of yarn factories" is somewhat problematic to say that it is due to "depletion of raw materials." To put it more clearly: the raw materials are there, but the general unscrupulous merchants hope to "hoard and speculate," and will not let go until they have made a big fortune, so they are "unwilling to sell lightly." Then how can it be "depletion of raw materials"? Of course, we cannot blame the general manufacturers too much. Businessmen have their own business scriptures, and no one is willing to do a loss-making business. Don't we see: "According to a survey by the silk industry, there are still 10,000 to 20,000 dan of cocoons stored in Shanghai foreign firms. If manufacturers purchase them, they cannot make a profit at the current silk market due to the high price." Then how can we blame them for being "willing to shut down and unwilling to continue driving"? The raw materials have already been exploited by the "hoarders" for the first time, and the cost has increased, making it unaffordable for general small industrialists; however, the sales of finished products and the silk market are also "seeing a decline in overseas markets due to the speculative activities of speculators." Repeatedly giving the intermediate merchants (of course, we cannot ignore their backstage bosses) direct and indirect exploitation, how can they not "fall without being hit"? The terrible fact that Tianjin's privately owned yarn factories have been swallowed one after another is a lesson from the past. Whether for the sake of the country or for the sake of the national industry, how can we lightly regard and ignore this tragic event. Others rely on their special political power as a cover, and under the beautiful name of "economic cooperation," they carry out all plans to destroy us "without seeing blood." What about us? The weak national industry has no strong support, which goes without saying, and the general unscrupulous merchants who only see "self-interest" dare to illegally slaughter their own national industry, regardless of whether there is a background or not, we always believe that it is a "hating my pain" disaster for the country. To those who are engaged in our "inherently insufficient" pitiful national industry, we dare to earnestly advise: we have no other way to make the national industry develop freely under protection except to consolidate our national defense.</p>

The earth gradually turned white, and the small vermilion houses by the station also turned white one by one.

<h3 id="e83">The Maritime Party Department Held a Memorial Week Yesterday to Condemn Traitors; Distributed Leaflets Appealing to Compatriots and Comrades Nationwide; National Seamen Swore Allegiance to the Party and the Nation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Special Maritime Party Department of China convened various maritime organizations at 10:00 AM yesterday for a memorial week to condemn traitors. Attendees included all committee members and staff of the Maritime Party Department, all committee members and staff of the Seamen's Union, the Shanghai Branch of the Seamen's Union of the Shanghai Maritime District Party Department, representatives from the New Taikoo Stevedores' Club, the Nautical Hostel, the Sanbei Hong'an Stevedores' Mutual Aid Society, the Commercial Ship United Benefit Association, the Middle Cabin Guild, the Little Yangtze Club, the Outer Harbor Stevedores' Mutual Aid Society, the Jardine Matheson Stevedores' Guild, the Jardine Matheson Stevedores' Club, and the Jardine Matheson After Cabin Agreement Society, totaling over 200 people. The meeting was chaired by special committee member Yang Hu, who distributed leaflets entitled "Please Unite, Compatriots and Comrades Nationwide, to Condemn the Traitor Zhang Xueliang, Rescue Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Support the National Government." The meeting adjourned around 11:00 AM. Details follow:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After Chairman Yang Hu led the attendees in customary salutations, he delivered a report, stating in brief: "Zhang Xueliang, entrusted with significant military responsibilities and the recipient of Chairman Chiang's unparalleled benevolence, has failed to reciprocate with gratitude. Instead, he has dared to rebel, seizing the commander-in-chief. Our government, responding to the people's demands, is righteously and justly condemning him. All Chinese seamen should strive to be the government's support, aiming to swiftly quell the rebellious atmosphere and ensure the early and safe return of our esteemed leader to the capital, to lead the entire nation in completing the great revolutionary cause."</p>
<p>Pledge</p>
<p>Following the chairman's report, all participants took an oath, the text of which read: "I pledge with utmost sincerity to be loyal to the Party and the Nation, to support Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. If I betray this oath, I am willing to accept the most severe punishment from this Party."</p>
<p>Distribution of Leaflets</p>
<p>"Please Unite, Compatriots and Comrades Nationwide, to Condemn the Traitor Zhang Xueliang, Rescue Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Support the National Government." The original text stated: "On the 12th of this month, the traitor Zhang Xueliang, colluding with the Communist Party in Xi'an, seized our supreme leader, betrayed the Party and the Nation, and made presumptuous claims, arousing the public indignation of the entire nation. Communications poured in from all sides, expressing the hope that Zhang Xueliang would abandon his erroneous views, heed the public's admonitions, and personally escort our universally supported Chairman Chiang Kai-shek back to the capital. The Central Government, with magnanimity, would surely not hold past actions against him, granting him an opportunity for self-renewal, and the people could also understand the hardships he faced under duress. Unexpectedly, Zhang Xueliang stubbornly adhered to his erroneous views, remaining unrepentant, disregarding the people's admonitions. The entire nation is filled with righteous indignation, unanimously telegraphing the Central Government to order the suppression of the rebellion. The Central Government, to respond to public sentiment, uphold the leader, maintain discipline and order, and consolidate national defense, had no choice but to condemn and punish him. The 30th meeting of the Central Political Council resolved that the National Government should order the suppression of the rebellion and appointed Committee Member He Yingqin as the Commander-in-Chief of the suppression, to swiftly direct the National Army to sweep away the rebellious traitors, first exerting efforts to pacify the interior, and then resist foreign aggression to save the nation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the nation's sole leader, the loyal disciple of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, and the savior of the Chinese nation. Therefore, his personal safety is truly related to the nation's survival and the strength of the nation. Zhang Xueliang, with a deranged mind, violating the will of the people, dared to lead his troops in seizing and betraying the central government, disregarding the sincere advice of the nation. The plot and intrigues cannot be reversed by correspondence alone. Therefore, only by issuing a clear order for condemnation, using the people's force, can we eliminate the wicked and stubborn traitors and criminals against the Party and the Nation. Zhang Xueliang, formerly the Commander of the Northeast, indulged in pleasure all day long, neglecting political affairs and failing to secure national defense, leading to the 'September 18th' Incident and the loss of the four northeastern provinces. He should have been severely punished, but fortunately, the Central Government showed leniency and still entrusted him with important responsibilities, tasking him with atoning for his sins. If Zhang Xueliang had any conscience, how should he have repaid this kindness? Who knew that he had the ambition of a wolf, repaying kindness with enmity, clearly betraying the Party and the Nation, yet falsely using the beautiful name of resisting the enemy. In fact, even a child of three feet knows that Zhang Xueliang is the creator of non-resistance. Now, he is detaining generals resisting the enemy on one hand, and telegraphing self-proclaimed resistance on the other. This contradictory and ugly state is truly self-deceptive, and who can believe it? The Red bandits have harmed China and, after repeated encirclements and suppressions by the army, could not establish a foothold in Jiangxi and Hunan, fleeing successively to the Northwest, having become fish in a kettle, and it would not be difficult to thoroughly eliminate them in the short term. Yet, Zhang Xueliang, ordered to suppress the bandits, showed no progress, and now colludes with the Red bandits, making absurd claims. From this, it is clear that unless Zhang Xueliang is eliminated first, the bandit scourge cannot be eradicated; unless the remaining Red bandits are eliminated, the people's suffering cannot be relieved. Therefore, the only crucial task now is to eliminate Zhang Xueliang, the pest of the people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, since taking the oath to launch the Northern Expedition, has led comrades of the Party and the people of the nation in continuous arduous struggle, enduring countless hardships, and only then has created today's unified situation. Politics is on track, construction has achieved many results, and preparations have been made for resisting foreign aggression. We are relying on the supreme leader to lead the nation in consolidating national defense and recovering lost territory. Yet Zhang Xueliang dares to risk everything, attempting to overturn the Central Government's national policy of suppressing bandits and resisting foreign aggression, plunging our nation into an irredeemable abyss. He is truly a national traitor, despised by both gods and men, unforgivable by heaven and earth. The Central Government, with supreme force, responding to the people's demands, has issued a clear order for suppression. The soldiers suppressing the rebellion are a hundred times more courageous. Everyone wants to eat the flesh and sleep on the skin of this criminal who betrayed the Party and the Nation. Therefore, all generals and soldiers who have been forced into error by coercion, or who have blindly followed suit due to temporary ignorance of the truth, should immediately reform themselves and resolutely revolt, striving to kill the enemy. If they can rescue the leader safely out of danger, they will surely receive the praise of the people and the heavy reward of the state."</p>
<p>Slogans</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's rebellion is the ringleader of betraying the Party and harming the nation. Seizing the Chairman is a rebellious traitor. Detaining the generals resisting the enemy in Suiyuan is a criminal who obstructs resistance against foreign aggression. Detaining the generals suppressing bandits in the Northwest is a criminal who obstructs the suppression of the Red bandits. Accommodating the Red bandits is the chief culprit of selling out the people. Losing territory and humiliating the nation is a criminal against the Chinese nation. Suppressing Zhang Xueliang is to eliminate rebellious ministers and traitors, to maintain the righteous spirit of the nation, to rectify the discipline and order of the country, to consolidate the unity of the country, to implement the national policy of suppressing bandits, eliminating traitors, resisting foreign aggression, and saving the nation. Suppress Zhang Xueliang, the traitor who betrayed the Party and the Nation and rebelled against his superiors. Overthrow Zhang Xueliang, who colluded with the Red bandits and lost territory and humiliated the nation. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is the savior of the nation. Everyone rise up and rescue Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Everyone rise up and rescue Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the savior of the nation. Whoever rescues Chairman Chiang Kai-shek from danger is a national hero. Northeastern generals and soldiers, if you want to preserve your lives, you must revolt immediately. Northwestern people, if you want to live and work in peace, you must rise up to suppress the rebellion. Only by rescuing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek can we save China. Only by supporting the National Government and supporting the Chinese Kuomintang can we save China. Only by implementing the Three Principles of the People can we save China. Long live Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, long live the Three Principles of the People, long live the Chinese Kuomintang, long live the Republic of China.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Various Maritime Organizations Issued Declarations in Response to the Leader Rescue Association <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese United Federation of Ship Inspectors, the Chinese General Association of Merchant Ship Officers, the Chinese General Association of Yangtze River Pilots, the Chinese Association of Ship Radio Operators, and the Chinese United Federation of Yangtze River Pilots—five organizations—and all seamen, responding to the Leader Rescue Association, issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "Dear compatriots, what is your attitude towards Zhang Xueliang and his subordinates' recent act of seizing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and betraying the central government? Sympathy or abhorrence? If you are Chinese, you should frankly express it. Frankly speaking, anyone who has not forgotten that they are a part of China cannot remain silent about such a major event concerning the safety of the entire nation. Everyone expresses deep abhorrence and is filled with grief and indignation. Dear compatriots, aren't you like this? We now respectfully present the following points to all compatriots of the nation who have blood and spirit, praying that you immediately summon the greatest courage and determination to unanimously participate in the Leader Rescue Association, and use the power of the true people's front, which Zhang rebel calls the 'People's Front,' to rescue our only leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who is reviving the nation. Because if we don't do this, we will lose our mentor, and China will fall back into a state of disintegration, giving the enemy an opportunity to intensify aggression. Listen, here are our roars: (1) We respectfully participate in the Leader Rescue Association with twelve thousand percent enthusiasm and sincerely support all the association's proposals and resolutions. (2) We are willing to shed the blood of tens of thousands of Chinese seamen across the country to rescue the leader. (3) We are determined to use the power of the people to punish Zhang, who betrayed the central government, undermined unity, and seized the leader, and all the traitors who harbor the intention of harming the country and sympathize with Zhang. (4) We swear with sincerity to support the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the revolutionary leader who is reviving the nation, and to fight tooth and nail against any imperialism and all reactionary forces. (5) We firmly believe that to save China, we must rely on ourselves, and only our own strength is the true strength. We must plan for ourselves, rely on our own efforts, and all the sweet words of international affairs are deception, all are poison. In short, now is the world of national war, and everyone is waging war, seeking the survival of their own nation. The Soviet Union is fighting for the future of the Slavic nation, and Germany is striving for the glory of the pure Germanic nation. Does China willingly forget the great, long-standing, and glorious history of the Chinese nation for thousands of years and become cannon fodder for other nations? If not, we should repent from now on, make a determination, and take the interests of the motherland above all else as the principle, and strive for national revolution, in order to implement the Three Principles of the People and enter the world of great harmony. (6) We believe that in the world there is only mutual assistance, not unilateral aid. The Chinese people should shed their own blood to defend their motherland; no foreigner will shed it for us. Therefore, we should strive for self-improvement, work hard to train, and strive to cultivate ourselves under the leadership of a supreme commander, in order to be loyal to the motherland and loyal to the revolution. Undoubtedly, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has objectively become China's only supreme leader. May we ask, how can we do without him now when the nation is in dire straits? (7) In order to revive the nation, we should oppose all reactionary parties that disperse the central government's strength and deprive the motherland's interests. We advocate national unity, support the Three Principles of the People, and melt the thoughts of the Chinese people into one furnace, in order to unify actions, align steps, and create a kind of great invincible force. (8) We look forward to the early release of the revolutionary leader from danger, and we hope that Zhang Xueliang and his subordinates, as well as those suffering from the same disease as Zhang, will immediately repent of their past mistakes and unanimously work hard to resist foreign aggression under the command of the central government. At the same time, we hope that everyone will loudly shout, 'Return our revolutionary leader Chiang Kai-shek to freedom!' Use the power of the true 'People's Front' to rescue the leader back to the capital, preside over the major plans of the country, eliminate the remaining warlords, eradicate the Red bandits who harm the country, eliminate all reactionary parties, concentrate forces, consolidate the central government, and support the National Government. Long live the Three Principles of the People, long live Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, long live the Republic of China."</p>
