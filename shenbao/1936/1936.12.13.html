<h3 id="c48">諾貝爾獎金給獎 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>據昨日國民社斯篤庫爾姆電。本年度的諾貝爾獎金。巳於十日在奧斯洛及斯篤庫爾姆兩地。由瑞典王格斯多夫親自給獎。到會領獎的。有化學·物理·醫學等獎金的得主。祇有本年度文學獎金的得主奧尼爾。與一九三五年和平獎金的得主奧西哀斯基。沒有親來領獎。奧尼爾因病。他的獎金由美國駐瑞典公使代領。奧西哀斯基則尙在德國。因爲他不能親來領獎。特由斯坦敎授作一簡短的演說。介紹這位榮譽的得獎者。據瑞典報紙所說。這是對於諾貝爾和平獎金得主的空前未有的演說辭。</p>
<p>在各種諾貝爾獎金中。文學獎金與和平獎金兩種。一向是最受注意的。因爲文學在世界的流傳性。特別廣泛。每一個文學作家獲得這項獎金。他的作品就更會得到世界人士的傳誦。至於和平獎金。則因爲和平問題關係於全世界人民的安寗及幸福。在戰雲瀰漫各處的現時。自然更受到大家的關切了。</p>
<p>然而。在世人對於諾貝爾和平獎金的關切中。這次不能親往瑞典領受和平獎金的奧西哀斯基。還是特別値得我們關切的一個人。斯坦敎授爲他而作的演說辭。是有特殊的原因的。爲什麽呢。以往獲得諾貝爾和平獎金的人物。都是在政治上有了聲望地位的。如英國的政治家張伯倫·漢特遜。如著作家諾曼安傑爾。如本年度得獎的阿根廷外長拉瑪斯。都是。然而奧西哀斯基却不是這樣的人物。他是一個無名的著作家。他只會在報紙上鼓吹和平。他還是一個罪犯。原來他從一九三一年起。就因鼓吹和平而獲罪了。最近三年來。他的生活是在德國黑暗的集中營度過的。他已經滿身殘病。但是爲了他對於和平的堅决信心。在這個充滿戰爭的世上。終有許多人認識他。不忘記他。而且努力爲他營救。向國際間宣傳把和平獎金給與他。本年九月在英國出版的一個小冊子。名爲「他犯了什麼罪」。由赫胥黎·威爾斯·麥考萊·潑里斯脫萊·等十五著名學者作家執筆。就是爲他呼籲的。結果他竟被釋放了。而諾貝爾獎金委員會。居然也决定把去年的和平獎金補贈給他。不過這幸運的消息。却又帶來了一個不幸的結果。德國當局因奧氏得了和平獎金。認爲是一種侮辱。一面向諾貝爾獎金委員會抗議。一面又把病弱不堪的奧氏扣留住了。於是在這次諾貝爾獎金的給獎禮中。竟不能見到這位光榮的得主。</p>
<p>爲和平而受罪。爲和平而遭刧。正是目前戰雲瀰漫世界時候的必然現象。然而單從這一點。也可見爲和平而努力者的値得寳貴了。</p>

<p>本市曹家渡憶定盤路寶華·裕村·益友·三織綢廠工人五百餘人、自十日晚發生工潮後、因勞資雙方態度堅决、事態在僵持中、昨晨附近永豐等六廠、曾一度停工、工人分向黨政當局、及杜月笙虞洽卿王曉　諸氏請求援助、大公社記者、茲分誌各情於次、</p>
<p>各廠援助</p>
<p>寶華裕村益友一織綢廠、前因無故開除工人發生糾紛、旋經准社會局批示、各開除工入准予復工、工人遵令復工、遭廠方拒絕、以致發生罷工件、昨爲第三日、罷工工尙在　續中、但秩序頗佳、昨晨六時許、三廠附近之永豐天成福星經成等六廠工人一千餘人、　實行停工、以爲聲援、旋經工會派員勸止、故仍照常工作、但工人情緒緊張、如不能解决、恐將蔓延、</p>

<p>首屆大學聯足球錦標賽、自前週開始以來、　南以二戰二勝列居前導、復旦亦已戰勝光華、雖對同濟尚有一賽、但勝算可以穩操、故復曁兩隊、在該賽中已成均勢、昨日兩隊相逢於眞如、成敗關頭、在所必爭、戰情始終緊張而激烈、惟復旦以缺乏脚頭、故爲曁南以六對二壓倒、</p>
<p>交鋒後曁南先攻、相持約十五分鐘、復旦左鋒方寶齡、得左方接濟、先行登記、但一分鐘後、仍爲曁南猛攻、右鋒梁耀華於人叢中穿出、低射中的、一比一造成平等、再過十分鐘、暨南中鋒伍樹芳、又建一功、遂以二比一超出、並以此結束上半時、曁南前導、　樣後、曁南愈戰愈勇、攻勢更盛、復旦因上半時過於嚴守、以致落後、因改取攻勢、不意後防稍鬆、遂爲曁南乘虛而入、桀耀華先於五分鐘時建功、比數增至三對一、旋薛雍源、亦於罰球綫上射中、四比一形勢更見優越、俄而蔡今才又得左翼傳球、一碰入網、成五比一、復旦於此時亦反攻甚烈、方寶齡劉祖修最見活躍、終以缺乏接應、未能如願、未幾、復旦腹地、又爲曁南所困、伍樹芬於邊綫傳中、落點極佳、蔡今才臥地一碰、擦橫木又入、姿勢美妙、得未會有、曁南旣以六比一前導、錦標已見穩面、而梁耀華亦因傷退出、以張民治入代、復旦諸鋒、並不因希望已絕而氣綏、仍奮力反攻、距終塲的十分鐘、李昌熾於邊綫傳中、掠門而過、劉祖修趕上一挑、從橫木頂上彈入、遂以六對二結束戰局、曁南以三戰三勝、榮獲大學聯首屆錦標、繼承江大時代之偉業、裁判陳吉祥、</p>

<p>足球錦標</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時先舉行足球錦標决賽、的翰雖得地利之宜、終以實力相差一籌、爲上屆冠軍金陵隊所淘汰、金陸隊員、身材均異常高大、佔得不少便宜、而進攻之銳利、與夫聯絡之純熟、初未减其上屆冠軍之雄風、惟的翰亦力事防守、使金陸無法進展、上半時各無所獲、檸檬後的翰力圖進取、後防稍見鬆懈致爲金陵乘隙而入、損失三球之多、遂遭淘汰、爲金陵蟬聯錦標、至明强對滬江之落選複賽、謂同時舉行、滬江初時聲勢極盛、以一比〇前導詎最後反爲明强以三對　淘汰、實出意料之外、的翰與明强兩隊、復餘勇可賈、再於下午三時一刻、舉行亞軍决賽、的翰實力較强、以二比一獲勝、榮膺亞軍、先時約翰球塲、尙有一幕友誼足球賽、爲東吳大學隊對約翰大學隊、結果約翰上下半時各射中一球、以二比〇獲勝、至各隊塲陣容、均與前日相同、已出各塲結果如後、</p>
<p>（一）明强勝沁江（落選賽）三對二（上半時）〇比一</p>

<p>西聯甲組足球、東華與聖芳濟、昨日重逢於逸園、結果東華以四對一獲勝、東華乙組球員竟佔其半、陣容零落、昨賽竟兩失十二碼球、茲將昨日戰情、略述如后、</p>
<p>上半時</p>
<p>聖芳濟先攻、相持八分鐘、東華卽得十二碼機會、孫錦順執罰中的、先開紀錄、此後東華攻勢雖盛、但以球運未亨、均失交臂、未幾、聖隊右衛史登搿犯規、又被罰十二碼、羅海光執行、一罰不中、因蘇石於羅舉足時擅自行動、再判重罰、羅海光二次執行、仍被蘇石擋出、不久、羅又於十五碼處射門、仍因脚頭軟弱被接、上半時遂以一對零結束、東華佔先、</p>
<p>下半時</p>
<p>檸檬後、聖芳濟漸見活躍、十五分鐘時、喬尼何於邊綫遙射、張榮才接而復失、惠萊衝上、一蹴入網、造成平等、士氣爲之一振、而束華門下、亦頻見鐵騎　橫矣張榮才手揮脚踢、救出兩决險球、二十分鐘時、賈幼良運球前進、底綫左傳吳納浩來得恰好、力射命中、東華以二比一領先、再過三分鐘、賈幼良吳納浩取得聯絡、左右翼輔而前、直衝到底、人球並進、賈吳亦同時被激仆地、球由賈腿部彈入網窩、三對一東華勝利穩定、終以此三對一結束全局、東華獲勝、昨日出塲陣綫如下、</p>

<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>綏遠的戰事，因爲我們前綫戰士的忠勇，和我們全國人士的紛紛援助，那邊是已獲得很大的勝利了，上星期中的收復百靈廟，史是繫敗匪賊，奪回失地，最光榮的一回事。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們聽到這種勝利的悄息，不是很快樂很興奮嗎？不過，在這個時候，我們一面慶祝我們的勝利，一面千萬不可忘了愛國家的責任，要知道僞匪這次的犯綏，决不是一次的被我擊敗，就完全終止的，牠正在準備二次三次的大舉進犯呢？所以，我們在後方的援助工作，應該是再接再厲地起來，盡我們最大的努力！</p>
<p>現在全國的人十們，確已熱烈地起來，幹着各種援綏的工作，像「一日運動」「一元運動「减食」「停煤等等英勇的運動，但我在這裏，却要向全國的小朋友們，來提出一個「一角運動」，就是希望我們每個兒童，大家來捐出一角錢來貢獻國家，援助綏遠，盡我們最微小的救國的責任！</p>
<p>我想：這一個建議，一定會得到全國小朋友們的響應，因爲我們雖然都是年幼的兒童，救國的力量，是最小的，但是，我們大家本愛國人人應有的心，有錢的兒童，只要在糖菓·玩具中省下一角錢來，貧苦的兒童，也可在衣服·飲食中省下一角錢來，把這錢送到報館裏，或銀行等，匯給前綫在浴血苦戰的軍士們，這是一伴輕而易舉的事，然而假使能够全國數千萬兒童，都做到的話，那也立刻就四有幾百萬塊的巨額金錢，供獻給剿匪殺賊的戰士了。</p>
<p>全國的小朋友們！我希望你們大家來討論，努力推行這「一角運動」！</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>這次爲了匪爲的進攻綏遠，使國人對於綏遠立刻重視起來，援綏運動也正日見擴大，但我們相信有許多人直到現在，對於綏遠的一切，還是不大明瞭。因此；在這裏要把綏遠的沿革，交通，物產，以及風俗人情，約　的介紹一些，請小朋友們也可在腦中留下一個深刻的印象。</p>
<p>沿革　綏遠於民國三年劃爲特別區，到了民國十七年才改特別區爲行省，以歸綏爲省會，目前所轄有一等縣四，歸綏，薩拉齊，包頭，豐鎭，一等縣四，武川，興和，五原，集寗，三等縣八，托克托，東勝，凉城，淸水河，和林袷爾，陶林，固場，臨河等。</p>
<p>交通　綏遠的陸地交通，鐵路有平綏路，從北平起，經察哈爾，山西至綏遠的包頭縣止，長約七百五十公里，也稱平包路。這條鐵路將來的計劃，南下接隴海路，東南接平漢路，津沛路，環成一大圈，至於功用方面，在國防上策應非常便利，而在文化上，商業上，更有發展的希望，至於公路方面，有綏張路，綏蒙路，西綏路，寗包路，包東路，是五大幹綫，全長一，四〇〇公里，目前已全部通車，另外有支錢四十條，長三，八〇〇公里，內中有三分之一還沒有築成。</p>
<p>農產　綏遠土地肥沃，農產豐多，除了米沒有出產外，小麥，大麥，玉米，高梁，小米，糜黍，燕麥，蕎麥，大豆，　豆，豌豆，錄豆，豉豆等都有出產，而且量的方面，也是不少，此外已種或未種而適於森林的地帶，更在一萬萬市畝以上。</p>
<p>畜牧　據中央農業實業所民國二十二年的估計，綏遠一省，主要的家畜有黃牛二七五，〇〇〇頭，馬九三，〇〇〇頭，騾三七，〇〇〇頭。驢六一，〇〇〇頭，肉　有羊三，二九七，〇〇〇頭，平均每家有十五頭餘，猪一，七〇四，〇〇〇頭，平均每家有九頭，鷄二，丸八一，〇〇〇頭，平均每家有十二頭餘，鴨八〇，〇〇〇頭，平均每家有十分之二頭。</p>
<p>風俗　綏遠的居民，雖然還有不少是蒙人，但自山西，河北，山東，河南，等地移來的漢人也是不少，尤其是山西人，在綏遠的移民，已有一二百年的歷史，人數也多，所以風俗人情，和山西也不無大同小異了。男女婚姻，仍用父母之命，媒妁之言，極少自主，人死了有錢的衣衾棺木，也是窮極奢華，燒化冥紙，喊和尚念經，也是不能免俗，養了兒子，過滿月，做百歲，有錢的人家是非常熱鬧的。</p>
<h3 id="c188">寄生 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>在星期日那天的早晨，敏兒剛起身了不久，覺得肚子裏在發痛，便很沒趣的坐在椅子裏發呆，</p>
<p>『你呆坐在這裏幹嗎？是不是有些不舒？』他的哥哥聰兒這樣的問着他。</p>
<p>不知道今天爲什麼肚子裏痛得很？』他一面說着，一面便去大便了。</p>
<p>不多一會，敏兒很快的跑出來對他哥哥說：』眞奇怪，我不知怎麼排洩出了很多的虫，而肚子倒不痛了。哥哥，那是什麼虫？』</p>
<p>『那一定是蛔虫了。』</p>
<p>『什麽蛔虫？』</p>
<p>『蛔虫是一種寄生的動物。它常常寄生在入身體裏的腸內，粗看上去，它和蚯蚓差不多，但仔細的去看，它身上是沒有環節的，所以我們呌它是圓形動物。它身上的顏色是黃白色　或梢帶一些淡紅色，而兩端較細，腹背兩部和兩側各有直綫條，背上的那一條呌背綫，在腹面的呌腹錢，兩側的呌側錢，這是它外表的大概形狀。但寄生動物都有一般的性質；（一）它們是寄生在一切動物體中，吸收已成的養料，所以它們的悄化器管　很簡單。而蛔虫竟不生胃的。（二）它們的生殖是特別的發達，而蛔虫的生殖力，很可驚入，有人計算過，蛔虫能在一畫夜是能產生一萬五千個卵。（三）它們寄生　在動物體內，所以它們的感覺力　很薄弱，因爲它們是不需要的。（四）它們的頭部都有釣或是吸盤，那便可固定它們的地位。』</p>
<p>『那麽蛔虫和我們有什麼關係呢？』</p>
<p>『寄生動物大都是寄生在人體裏的腸，吸取血液和養料，影響小的，便是肚子痛，影響大的，便要體內缺少血，頭痛，肌肉疼痛，食慾不振，精神異常等疾病，甚至還要死亡，蛔虫的影響是比較少一些。但是總有害處的。』</p>
<p>『那麽我們怎樣預防呢？』</p>
<p>『它們傳入我們的身體，大都是直接的。像蛔虫就是它的卵隨它所寄生的動物的　大便排出體外，如遺落在水中或蔬菜上，人便去喝水或吃不熟的菜蔬，於是它的卵同入體內，在腸中發育起來。所以你下次吃東西的時候，要特別的小心，千萬不可吃沒有燒熟的東西。』</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>自從科學發達以來，戰爭比以前就格外可怕了。現在的戰爭完全是化學戰爭，其中最可怕的，要算是放射毒氣，我們應該知道，戰爭一旦爆發，不分前方和後方，敵人就可派多數的轟炸機，來襲擊我主要的都市　或重要資源地，並且要放射各種毒氣，加以殺害後方的人民，而牽制前方作戰的兵士，和未受毒區域的人民，給予精神上的重大打擊，所以我們對於防毒方面的智識，不可不加以深切的研究，和防護的方法怎樣施行。在這裏，我介紹給一個簡易的防毒面具的　製法，諸位小朋友！趕快製造一個來玩玩吧！</p>
<p>方法：預備一個洋鐵香烟罐頭，在蓋口邊上鑿小孔兩個，爲繫繩之用，再在罐底鎜多數小孔，然後到藥房內去買炭酸鈉　及一硫硫酸鈉各若干，用清水調勻，越濃越好，再加幾許甘油調和之，藥棉就浸透其中，將浸濕的藥棉，放到做好的罐頭中，罐的外面須蒙浸入這溶液中的紗布，這樣子，便可以繫在面部　遮掩口鼻，而成爲一個簡易的防毒面具了。</p>
<p>還有兩個防毒的更簡單的方法，就是把日常所用的手巾，浸入淸水，遮住口鼻呼吸，可以防較輕的毒氣，又用肥皂水，將毛巾浸濕，或急時用本人的小便，遮掩口鼻亦可，這是我們臨時極容易辦到的。</p>
<p>小朋友呀！我們防毒面具是做好了，不過，我們應該曉得，我們是多麽危險呵！隨時隨地，敵人都可以來襲擊，施以最殘酷的手段，所以我們不得　不早作準備，並且防毒面具買價很貴，我輩窮白姓如何買得起呢？因此，希望全國二萬萬的小朋友！趕快到窮鄕僻壤的　農村去宣傳，好在這裏的簡易的防毒面具，任何人可做得到，想來諸位一定個個樂於擔任的罷！</p>

<p>耶穌聖誕節和二十六年元旦快要到臨了，於是休息了一年的　聖誕老公公，又得活動起來，白鬍鬚，紅衣裳，在市上到處可以見到，而他背上的那個挺大　的包裹，照例是裝滿了花花綠綠的玩具，預備送給那些有幸福的小　朋友們的。</p>
<p>但是，小朋友們，這是國難嚴重的時期，緩遠的邊境正在被匪僞侵擾着，敵人的飛機，不斷的飛來擲彈轟炸；國軍中的戰士們正　在吞冰嚼雪，浴血抗戰；並且靑島一片乾凈土，又平白地受了鐵蹄的踐踏。試問在這樣的情勢　之下，小朋友們還有心情弄玩具來玩麽？</p>
<p>昨天跟着爸爸上先施公司去買東西，走到第五層樓上，見有許多工友正在忙着裝置佈景，上面所畫的，全是冰天雪地的模樣，我好奇心切，先自進去繞了個圈兒。據那裏的一位職員先生和我爸爸說，這是他們因鑒於國難嚴重，非將國防意義灌輸到小朋友們腦筋中去不可，所以新翻花樣，做一番有意識的點綴，以最近國軍克復的百靈廟作背景，描摹出前錢愛國將士殺敵致果的壯舉來，使小朋友們一到此間，彷彿身歷其境，而引起了愛國的熱忱。像這樣的官傳玩具，委實是其他商人們大可取法的。</p>
<p>那天可惜還在佈置，沒有完成，等他們完全之後，我一定要的幾位小朋友同去參觀，雖不能親上綏遠前錢去，到了這裏，也大有可觀了</p>

<p>— 董遜</p>
<p>問：鯊魚是不是一種屬於魚類的動物？答：是的，鯊魚是一種軟骨類的魚，屬橫口類中之絞類，所以鯊魚又名爲餃，問：什麼呌做軟骨魚？答：在地球上所有的一萬六千餘種的角類之中，可分爲二目，一種是硬骨目，凡是屬於道一目的魚類，它們的骨骼都是硬質的；一種就是軟骨目，它們適和硬骨目相反，都是軟骨質的。此外，它們的尾鰭都是不正形的，上葉比下葉闊大些，體外面生着楯狀的鱗片，鰓的外面沒有鰓蓋，體裏面沒有鰾，這些都是軟骨魚特異的地方。</p>
<p>問：那末「橫口類」是什麼呢？答：橫口類是軟骨魚中的一個種類，凡屬於這一類的魚，它們的嘴巴都是很大而橫裂的，生在腹面；鼻孔生在口吻的下端：鳃孔有五對，但是也有六對或七對的。它們的稚兒或是胎生，或是卵生。問：鯊魚最大的有多麽大？答：鯊魚中以長尾餃爲最長大，有一丈五·六尺，雙髻餃長一丈許，鼠鮫長一丈許，貓餃長三·四尺，白餃，靑絞，角餃都是兩·三尺左右長的。問：請你把這幾種鯊魚的形態大略地講給我們聽。答：好的，現在我就開始講，你靜心地聽着吧！</p>
<p>（一）長尾餃：它的頭部短小得很，嘴端是圓形的，背鰭很是高大，胸賭也很闊，尾鰭的長度和軀幹的長度相等。</p>
<p>（二）雙髻餃：這種鯊魚又名橦木鯊，因”它的頭部生得左右突出，變形爲雙髻的形狀，又像寺院中敲鐘用的撞木拐杖頭的樣子，很好看。</p>
<p>（三）鼠餃：它的身體也很長大，頭部的形狀尖銳如鼠，尾鰭很大。　　（四）貓鮫：貓鮫的身體比鼠　要小得多，這恰和陸地上眞的貓咪與老鼠的大小相反。同時因爲它的頭形和斑紋好似老虎，所以又呌「老虎鯊。」它的頭部形如鐵鎚，吻端爲鈍圓形。體背上的顏色是淡茶而微紅，有許多深褐與淺褐色的橫條紋，好像老虎的斑紋，這種鯊魚的緒形都很大，兩脊背鰭的前端各有一强大的硬棘。</p>

<p>— 海</p>
<p>在沿着伏爾加河上去的時候，那船由幾匹馬在岸上背着　。忽地有一陣很利害的風潮襲來，船夫們因爲要使那船免得撞到岸邊去，使用了一支粗重的槳，竟不小心將柏絲可菲和其他兩個搭客打下河去。辛而他們不久都被救了起來，不過船上究哦隱秘的地方，柏絲可菲不肯當衆露出伊的身體來，那一套打濕了的衣服，黏在身上，更損害了伊的健康。那密林夫人所信託的一位朋友，從諾夫高洛和伊分手之後，仍由伊單獨的前進，旣不會給伊什麼介紹的信，也沒有指示伊前進的路徑，使伊孤零零的晤中摸素，所幸那仁慈的密林夫人慷慨的帮助伊，使伊的錢袋和行李，都比剛從依吉村出發時充實得多了。船夫們在一條橋脚下的碼頭上，把伊放上岸去。伊瞧見前面的一片高地上，有一座禮拜堂，伊照常在尋覓宿所之前，到那裏去祈禱一下。那禮拜堂中是空空的，但伊聽得一排木格子的後面”許多婦人的聲音，正在做着祈禱，原來這所在是一座女修道院，而這些婦人的聲音，頓時使伊得了新的鼓勵和安慰。伊想：『要是上帝能接受我的祈禱我也願意像伊們那麼把臉面躱在面幕之後，除爲伊很怕投上客店去，受人家的粗暴的待遇。當下沒事可做，便重又祈禱起來。有一個女尼來和伊說是修道院關門的時候了。請伊快快出去。柏絲可菲卽忙和伊說因爲自已不願意上客店去，可否許伊在這裏住宿一夜。那女尼回說，伊們從不接待外來的旅客，但是伊們的院長也許能給伊一些帮助的。柏絲可菲打開伊的錢袋給那女尼看，說明自己在依加什林寗堡時會得慈善朋友們的資助，並不再要什麼錢，只求一宿罷了。那女尼很歡喜伊那落落大方的態度，就帶伊去見院長。伊那一段坦白而動人的故事，加以護照的證明，和密林夫人的介紹信，頓使那位溫和的院長又興奮，又快樂，很殷勤的留伊睡在自己的臥房裏，又見伊前幾天跌落在伏爾加河中時所受的傷害，便决意挽留伊多件幾天，休養一下。</p>
<p>柏絲可菲住過了幾天之後，却害起病來，病勢十分沈重，醫生們說伊的性命已達到了很危險的地步；但伊雖然覺得自已的病沒有起色，還是並不失望，一面向自己說道：「我，不相信我的末日已經臨頭，希望上帝允許我完成我的工作』。果然隔不多時，已經漸漸的復原起來，雖然復原得非常的遲漫，足足挨過了漫長的夏季。伊居然又能繼續伊們行程了。可是伊那病後的身體，非常軟弱，受不了驛車的顚播，只得仍在女修道院中等候着坐了雪車出發。</p>

<p>晨開爲一一五五元、較前收下挫二角、元茂永同泰昌供給、退爲五元內、但以生源永慶發永微納升至五元一角、萬興宏利來售、降爲四元九角、匯豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平而尚定、成大恒餘乘低維持、白銀平衡稅揭曉勿動、此際盤旋於五元光景同泰昌春源、永元茂永來賣、又退爲四元九角、大昌祥努力維持、午收爲一一五四元九角、</p>

<p>昨證劵巿場公債巿况、續見上漲、人氣亦絕　定、因時局雖尙沉悶、惟大戶買胃仍濃、散戶亦多收進、市價於蓬勃之檯面上、一致上升、惟空方大戶亦有拋賣加碼、故至後市、漸轉回降、因多空雙方尚在相持中、故頗呈盤旋之勢、昨日上午開盤、趨勢頗見挺昂、大戶如三十五·四·五號等收買均極踴躍、五十號及五十四號等頗多出籠及拗賣、市價一致高升二角至四角半、次盤市况仍趨堅俏、二十·十一·七十七號等買氣愈盛二十五號則轉有賣出、四十七·四十一三號仍有拋賣、戊乙等續漲一角至三角半、甲種本月回小五分、下午開盤、行市轉呈疲勢、四·十一·號等尚多收買、三十五·五號等均頗有賣出、除戊種本月尚好一角、餘均回降五分至三角、收盤　十五·五十四號等仍有大批拋賣或出籠、市况續呈疲態、再小一二角、惟四號買進本月期各債甚多、全日結果、一律高漲五分至三角半、成交總數、計七百二十二萬元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<p>原函、略云：頃　　　二月四日生絲行情、內所載「美法兩　　絲　　　、國內　絲價相距二十元許」云云、以當日（三四）紐約華　七八分二〇——二一條份現貨、拍合華幣價格、再扣除出口費等於七百九十元左右而是日　　所載之白廠絲二〇——二一最高價為七百　十元、似乎國外仍較滬市高出九十元左右、諒係滬市成交之絲、或為低級品　之　、惟貴報訪員所用以與國外市塲作比者、究收何種生絲為標準乞、便中間明見示、以資參考為荷、</p>
<p>（答）承詢、節、茲為分別答覆於下、</p>
<p>（一）　日絲業新　云、國風外價絲相差二十元許一語、係以國外電滬　貨之限　、與申埠廠商持價相較而言、具絲品當為普通B字等級、</p>
<p>（二）國外絲不能與申市當日售盤相吻合、其原因有三、</p>
<p>（甲）生絲類別繁多、同一白廠經七八分二、一二條份、但其可分之等級有GXX.　Exta　Extra　B.　ill級、其不可分者、有好A字、好B字次A字、次B字等等、此等係以其牌之信用和出品而定、其絲身、又有直繅絲·復繅絲·揚返與　揚返之別、因其絲身不同、其售價亦異、</p>
<p>（乙）國外絲價需之到申者、有紐約絲商之索價、海外購者之　價、此價無標準可言、固日西商所接到之電、互有上下、）及路透所傳播之交易所實售行市、其出入之處、更屬難免、與國內絲商之持價或售開之行市更難吻合、</p>
<p>（丙）華絲外銷、操縱於西商之手、其看　看　、放盤或捺低市盤、乃其常事、本報所載國外行市、係廣泛的供給絲商作一覩國外售盤之直商　、其協合申市、亦僅作為參考、固不能與申市信號盤相同也、且西商扣除之佣金、　　　、亦各互異、實不能一槪而論、</p>

<h3 id="c215">新土耳其的經濟建設 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 王特夫</p>
<p>凱末爾統治下的新土耳其，是建立在這三大主義之上的，卽國粹主義，現世主義，工業立國主義。關於前兩者，因與本問題無直接關係，可不必特別　出來座論；我們所要在這裏提出的，是新土耳其的工業化的問題。</p>
<p>過去的土耳其，其基礎是建立於農業之上的，是歐洲列强共同侵略下的半殖民地　世界大戰告終以後，特別是戰勝希臘以後，一九二三年以來凱末爾統治下的新土耳其共和國，無論在經濟和政治方　，都努力從事於完全獨立的發展；它的最基本的任務，便是使農　國發展而爲工業國。</p>
<p>但是，依據諾桑條約的規定，土耳其沒有關稅自主權，道不消說是新土耳　經濟建設的一個極大障碍。據一九二七年的統計，當時土耳其的工業勞動者只有二五七，〇〇〇人，有工人一百以上的工廠只有三個，雇用工人五十以上的工廠也只三百二十一個，其總馬力不過一六五，〇〇〇馬力、至於工業所使用的原料，僅有二三二，六六六，〇〇〇土耳其鎊，其生產額也只有四三二，七四〇，〇〇〇土耳其鎊。在那些工廠中，主要的工業要算農業的工業，金屬工業，纖維工業，木材工業；它們要佔全土耳其的工業百分之九十五。及至一九二　年六月八日，政府的大評議會才開始通過了保護關稅法案。這便是新土耳其經濟上的國家主義的最初出現，也是它開始利用國外貿易的平衡來求自己經濟自立的表現。</p>
<p>一九三四年新土耳其更仿效蘇聯，制定五年計劃，實行計劃經濟。這計劃的重要點也和蘇聯計劃經濟有些類似，卽是將重要產業作爲國有國營，注意國防建設。及至去年，土耳其的唯一政黨國民黨又設立廣大的經濟計劃，並發表這樣關於工業的宣言：「以土耳其工業化爲目的而建設的諸工業，無論其爲私產或國有，都須依從國家的計劃。土耳其工業不是部分地集中，而必須把全國打成一片。因此國家必須統制價格，不許有對謚一般消費者提高價格的加爾特和托辣斯」。對於勞動問題也表明：「在一切經濟企業中，勞動與利潤要國家的地調和。雇用者和勞動者要由勞動法合理地統制。」道樣的統制，不僅施行於工業方面，就是對於農民也是如此。土耳其農民不得怠惰，由政府以最小的利息借錢給他們，使他們有土地耕種。同時政府又督促農民開發地下的富源，利用水力，統制森林；並向農民們說「全國電氣化是祖國發展的重要因素」。</p>
<p>在　樣的經濟計劃下，土耳其的工業分為了如下的幾個部門：卽（一）　維工業（棉，麻，毛），（二）金屬工業（鐵，石炭，蜉炭，銅，硫黃），（三）製紙，假象牙工　（紙，假象牙，人造絲），（四）陶磁工業（陶磁器等），（五）化學工業（硫酸，鹽素，重炭酸鹽，燐酸鹽）。同時，對於這些工業部門的投資並有這樣的决定（單位千土耳其鎊）：</p>
<p>棉紗紡織　一八，五三八</p>
<p>毛織工業　一，一六五〇</p>
<p>石炭工業　一，〇〇〇</p>
<p>硫黃工業　三〇〇</p>
<p>假象牙工業　一，〇二五</p>
<p>玻璃工業　一，二五〇</p>
<p>化學工業　三，〇〇〇</p>
<p>製麻工業　一，七〇〇</p>
<p>鐵工業　一〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>銅工業　五五〇</p>
<p>絲　　三，七九〇</p>
<p>人造絲工業　四九〇</p>
<p>磁器工業　八〇〇</p>
<p>由此崁看來，可見土耳其投資　多的是棉紗紡織工業，其次是鐵工業；這兩者可說都是當前土耳其最主要的工業。依據國家的經濟計劃，主要工業的豫定生產額是：棉布一〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇公尺，麻紗六〇〇，〇〇〇噸，毛綫一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇千格　姆，鐵一〇〇，〇〇〇噸，石炭六〇，〇〇〇噸。</p>
<p>其次是新土耳其的金融。爲了實行那樣的計劃經濟，土耳其政府特在一九三三年六月二日於安哥拉設立特別銀行。這銀行與土耳其銀行都是新土耳其的主要的金融機關。前者的資本總額爲二千萬鎊，而其流動資本則有六千二百　鎊；在五年計劃的施行中，政府每年要向它通融六百萬鎊；所有全國的投資，分配生產品，統制和指導經濟建設，都是它的重要任務。這個銀行在工業投資方面，首先進行的是紡織和製紙工業。在紡織工業方面，這銀行建立了三個大工廠：第一個是在克寒里，第二個在愛來里，第三個則在那基里。在這三個工廠中，第三個可說是歐洲最大最新式的現代工廠之一。它共有紡錘二萬三千，每年生產棉布三千萬公尺，要消費土耳其棉花五百六十基羅。第　個工廠的紡錘數有二萬五千，每年牛產棉布一千七白萬公尺。較小的第二個也有生產棉布七百萬公尺的能力。全土耳其所需要的棉布幾乎都是由這三個工廠供給的。</p>
<p>這個銀行在製紙工業方面的投資也很大，土耳其最大的伊茲米特的製紙工廠，便是由它投資設立的。只是這個工廠便要生產土耳其國內需要的紙張的百分之五十。</p>
<p>此外還有在國　經濟上和國防上都很重要的鐵工業，從去年起這個銀行就在開始　設，現刻正在計劃發展中。</p>
<p>至於土土其銀行，則是遠在一九二四年就創立的，當時僅有資本百萬鎊，現在它的資本已增至五百萬鎊了（本文中的鎊都是土耳其鎊；請勿誤爲英鎊）。這個銀行的投資活動首先是在一九二八年設立土耳其最早的砂糖工廠。其决是努力在鑛業方面，特別在石炭業方面投資。一九二六年它便在準加爾達克設立土耳共石炭公司，資本百萬鎊。隨後又在戈茲爾設立石炭公司，其資本最初是五十萬鎊，至一九二丸年更增至三百萬鎊。這個銀行形式上雖是民　的，但實際上却爲土耳其國民黨所支配的。</p>
<p>除上述兩大銀行外，還有土耳其政府的中央銀行，　資本現有一億六千萬鎊。這個銀行不消說是掌握着重要的國家財政機能的。</p>
<p>現在還須特別提說的，是土耳其的天然資源和其開發情形，這可說是新土耳其經濟建設的重要基礎。</p>
<p>土耳其地跨默亞兩洲，有人口千五百萬，而積　十九萬四千平方哩。說到它的物產，最豐富的是　物。它的鉻和寶砂粉居世界第一位。石炭產量也很有名；黑海岸上的準加爾達克便是近東最大的石　產地。同時，土耳　對於礦物的開採也很努力；牠的石炭產額在一九二三年僅有六十萬噸，及至　　三四年便增至二百，　十八萬噸了。銀的產額也很可觀，每年約有八千噸。硫黃的產額現在雖不過三千五百噸，但依據五年計劃，年產當在百五十萬噸以上。鉻·寶砂粉·錳以及褐炭等物，一九三四年產十二萬噸，現在當然也還有增加。此外如銅·鐵和石油的產額也不少。</p>
<p>土耳其的農業資源也很豐富，這可以由以下的數字來表明（單位海克特）——</p>
<p>適宜於耕作的土地　二三，一五七，三〇〇</p>
<p>有價值的森林地帶　一〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>牧塲　二七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇</p>
<p>在耕作的土地中，的有百分之九十適宜於榖物栽培；而小麥與大麥的面積更佔其百分之八十五。棉花的耕種　積也正在增加中，其中心地方是在亞達拉。</p>
<p>土耳其還是產水菜的地方。如葡萄·無花果·橄欖等，它每年都有輸出。在五年計劃規定之下，這些物品的產量也都有大量的增加；比較起過去的來，都要增產一倍以上。</p>
<p>在新土耳其的經濟建設中，與一般產業發展同時，鐵道建築也很有成績，到去年底，政府建設的鐵道已超過了六千目羅；並預定從一九三六年至一九四〇年要建築鐵道七千目羅。這樣下去，不消說是會促使土耳其的經濟更加發展的。當然，土耳其的經濟發展並未變更它社會的本質，不過，這是題外的話，這裏用不着持特別述了。</p>

<p>上月二十七日，死亡襲擊着寓居於法國邊境上的賭國摩那哥首都蒙德卡羅的巴西爾·柴哈羅夫爵士。故事般的神秘的傳說，充滿着柴氏的一生。他是歐洲的一位著名「軍火大王」。他的說話可以左右各國的政治以及各國民族的命運。從他的靑年時代以迄於他具有絕對巨大的權威時，他是始終被認爲「神秘之人」，而爲歐洲的若干君主與大政治家所畏懼而尊敬。</p>
<p>關於他的出身，是有着不少的傳說。據正式的記載，他是生於一八五〇年。「巴黎的巴西爾·柴哈羅夫是他的父親。歐戰時，英國首相勞合·喬治對於這位擔負着供給協的國軍火的軍火商人，很想多知道一些他的身世，於是委託着英國的秘密偵探部，從事偵探。結果，才知道了柴氏是生於君士坦丁的。他的父親是俄人，他的母親是希臘人。</p>
<p>他在幼年時被他的父親送至英國肄業。他在攻習英文之外，很快的又習得了法文，西班牙文，意大利文和阿拉伯文。他的父親去世時，遺給了他四〇〇〇〇磅的遺產。他在離校之後，很快的把遺產幾乎完全賭掉了。接着的若干年的生活便很難査考。有人說他曾漂流到紐的和美國的共他城市當過新聞記者，但這是無法加以證實的。而他的參加國際事件，是一直待到了他六十歲後的初期的事。那時，他是供應着埃及和尼爾河上游的軍火。</p>
<p>接着，他便被任爲駐在雅典的維克司兵工廠經理，成爲希臘政治圈中的要人。他的成爲一軍火商人是在近東方面發軔的。他對於任何軍火都經售。他曾任駐在巴黎的維克司兵工廠經理，專擔任對俄的軍火貿易。據說在日俄戰爭中，他曾承造俄國的戰船，而着實賺了不少的錢。</p>
<p>他雖然是一個軍火商人，同時，他也是歐洲的一位政客。他常任白里安與勞合·喬治的中間人。後來，他又奔走於勞合·喬治與克里門沙之間，接洽着英法二國間有關於歐洲的政治。在那時期中，他就被目爲「神秘之人一了，因爲他往來於倫敦，巴黎之間，是常在深夜之中往返的，而他的來往又都是搭着一艘毀滅艦，渡過海峽的。</p>
<p>在他的生活之中，最富有故事意味的事件之一，是在他七十餘歲時，在西京瑪德里所發生的那一回事。當他在宮內大梯上下來時，忽見一個貴族裝飾的靑年抓住了一個少婦的頸項，不住地搖撼着。於是他便猛力的衝上去而揷身其問。少婦被撞，幾至傾跌，於是他便用臂擁抱着。豈知這靑年是西班牙鮑旁王室中的弗倫雪司古公爵，是西王之侄。那少婦便是這公爵的夫人瑪璣娜，那時才只二十歲。</p>
<p>這是很有趣味的一幕活劇。但是從這一幕活劇中，柴氏便與公爵夫人開始發生了友誼。弗倫雪司古公爵，接着，是神經失常了，於是他的家人便把他幽囚在郊外的別墅裏。到了一九二四年便死了，而就在那一年柴氏娶了公爵夫人，很愉快的住在巴黎，尼司和蒙德卡羅各地。不料才只結婚了十八個月，這位柴哈羅夫夫人突然地死亡了，這眞是給與了柴氏以一個大打轚。從此以後，他便不常在社會上露臉了。</p>
<p>寓處，他是有着多處。在法國，亞旁維爾的巴林考脫別墅是一個最考究的。那本是比王利亞包爾特的產業，是法國最美麗的別墅之一。一切美術的裝飾是費了四十年的收集而自法國各地得來的。裏面的一切陳設也十分講究。後面並有柴氏划船用的池塘。不過他在冬季中總是住到蒙德卡羅去。據說，在大戰之後，柴氏在蒙德卡羅握有巨大的權力。在仿造自巴黎大劇塲的蒙德卡羅大劇場中，有三個特別廂座，中座是摩那哥太子佔有的，左座是柴氏的，右座是劇塲老板備給王室中人及各賭塲老板坐的</p>
<p>中年時的柴氏，身材較常人略高，貌清癯。當他八十歲時，共有財產二〇〇〇〇〇〇〇磅。在最近數年間，他的生活的神秘還是有增無减而與年俱進。卽如最近的焚毀他的日記，便是一例。在他的日記中，有着每天的事件的記載以及時人的批評。他恐身後爲人所發現，於是特派了六位秘書加以淸理而焚毁之。</p>
<p>雪茄烟上的彩紙，是常由他贈給朋友，作爲幸運的朕兆的。他也有者干迷信，但對於裏烟的彩紙的迷信特深。</p>
<p>雖然他是國際間的幕後人物之一，但是在巴林考脫別墅旁的村民們，却還誰都不知道他是歐洲的首富呢。</p>
<p>現在柴氏是死了，他的一生的秘密是永成爲秘密的了。有人說，他的事業將以此爲終點。但也有人說，他雖然死了，他的勢力是依然存在的。但是究竟如何，那恐怕只有歐洲政治舞台上的極少數人心裏明白吧。</p>

<h3 id="c217">文化社會學的評價 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 鄭逸</p>
<p>社會學是幾十年前才成立的一種科學，而文化社會學則更是最近十幾年內的產物，在歐戰以後才成立的，直到現在，牠還是在萌芽草創期間。因之，不僅人們一般對於文化社會學，有些尚不甚了了，有些甚至頗爲懷疑或進而反對，有些則對牠理解錯誤，而且就是那些自認是主張或贊成牠的人也是衆說紛紜，莫衷一是。這門（或者說道一派）學問發生於歐戰後的德國，加馬格思·韋白爾，杜羅爾茨，斯　格勒等人皆中張之。其後美國承繼了，響應了這種主張而風靡一時。至於我們中國，當然也「孔步亦步，孔趨亦趨」地步着美國的後塵，從「二把手」中把這新發生的文化社會學搬進這落後的中國來了，幷且廣爲應用，居然認作是自己的發見，如孫本文便是其主要的人物。在日本，如田中王堂，宮卯之助，津田左右吉，西村眞治等等，都可說是前後的文化社會派的學者。</p>
<p>不管有這樣多的主張牠或贊同牠的人，但是至今還未見有人有系統地著過一本文化社會學的書出來。我們之得以知道牠，多半是從各種雜誌論文上得來，或者在普通的社會學著作中見有附帶的提及，也有些社會學概論或社會學原理之類的書籍，根本就是用文化社會學派的觀點寫的，但標以文化社會學之名者，除了日本的關榮吉有一本「文化社會學」和我們這落後的中國還勉强有幾種如「社會的文化基礎一，「社會學之文化論幾册薄簿的小書而外，世界上都可說沒有。正因爲這樣，所以文化社會學究竟是一個甚麽東西，是否够得上稱爲科學，其內容爲何，這些都有一個簡單的叙述之必要。</p>
<p>我們初初看「文化社會學」這一名詞，就不禁令人懷疑：這是「社會學」呢，抑是「文化學」？如果說是社會學，那就只能說這是文化學派的社會學，如生物學派的社會學，唯物史觀派的社會學，唯心史觀派的社會學之類一樣，怎麽能在社會學這一總的名稱之上加上文化二宇呢？如果說是文化學，那這就只是以社會學的見地來研究文化的一種學問，根本就是文化學學說中的一派，不能呌做「文化社會學」的。所以一般說來，文化社會學不怕有多少人主張，援用，但寶際上仍是一個不妥的名詞。</p>
<p>其决，我們按照文化社會學派所規定的文化社會學的內容來考察。抑他們所說：「文化社會學是按社會的規定，去理解文化的學問（現代德國及日本的社會學）。」（見「文化社會學」）這就非常不通，旣然是「理解文化的學問」，又爲甚麼呌做「社會學呢？我們又看牠所列舉的內容，則有「文化之國民性」，「文化之階級性」，「文化之時代性」等等，這又可以證明牠是在處理文化而不是在處　社會，應屬於文化學而不應屬於社會學了。我們又見杜羅爾茨有「宗敎社會學」，斯齊勒有「智識社會學」，這其中，如宗敎，如智識，都屬於文化，研究宗敎或智識的學問都是文化學之一部份，而他們之所謂「文化社會學」也就是文化學的一個總名稱了。但是我們又看見孫本文在「社會的文化基礎」一書中說：「凡具有共同文化，因以表現共同行爲的一羣人，就是社會。」「除開文化，就沒有社會，社會就存於文化。」「社會是文化的產物。」這樣看來，那研究文化的學問就是社會學了。因爲文化是社會之母，是社會的基礎的緣故。只要把文化研究淸楚了，社會也就研究淸楚了。因之文化學就是社會學。其所以呌做「文化社會學」者，是有別於其他各派的社會學之故。再看斯齊勒的話：「集團和文化形態之多元論，才是一切社會學的出發點」，他不贊成德意志觀念論者之唯心一元論的社會學，同時也反對唯物一元論的社會學，認爲單是精神或物質都不足以說明社會之構造，都不能規定社會之發展，只有取各種文化要素，如宗敎，哲學等精神文化加上物質文化，而且要這各要素起相互作用，才能說明社會之發展。從這些看來，那所謂「文化社會學」又是社會學了。總之，這個名詞不但在理論上費解，難懂，不妥，而目連他們自己也沒有把牠弄清楚呢。</p>
<p>根據以上所說，不管文化學是甚麽東西，但總括各家意見，牠是以各種文化，如國民性，階級性，時代性，宗敎，智識等，作爲社會之精神要素和物質要素，認爲這些要素　生相互作用，便構成社會，規定社會之發展。同那觀念論社會學，唯物論社會　對待來說，牠是多元論的社會學。牠不只是用精神或經濟來說明社會，牠還要用國民，時代，人種，民族，地理，氣候，階級，職業等等應有盡有的東西來說明。</p>
<p>我們已經十分簡略地「文化社會學」解釋出來了，現在我們要根據我們所捉摸着的對象來加以評價。</p>
<p>如照文化社會學者所說：社會是混沌一團，爲各種文化交織而成，「社會是文化的產物」。各種文化相互間只有相互作用，而無决定作用。但是依　科學，社會之構造是有其下層基礎和上層建築的，下層基礎就是經濟構造，上層建築就是法律政治制度和各種意識形態。至於所謂文化，如資本主義文化，如封建文化，舉凡各種思想學術都屬於意識形態領域之中，而爲社會上層建築。科學的研究是在根本的說明，是在因果必然法則之闈發，僅是相互作用　　以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>是不够的。文化是爲經濟構造所决定，這是夫人皆知之事，至於文化之能起反作用於其上層建築，而使彼此間發生相互作用，那自不用說的；不過，最終的决定者仍爲其基礎，這才是科學的說明。社會學的任務，就是在說明社會之此種構造和此種構造的社會之進化發展的因果必然法則。這樣看來，文化社會學不但不能說明社會的眞實構造，抑且不知道牠的發展法則。牠一點也未能完成社會學的任務。所以牠能否成爲科學，仍　疑問。</p>

<h3 id="c218">是誰使今年豐收的？ <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>大家都知道「細菌」這一名稱吧？這衛生家視爲蛇蠍的東西，便是使我們今年豐收的大功臣！</p>
<p>不相信嗎？聽我說來：在我國，農人大都以糞便肥田，衛牛家一見，總掩鼻而過，說是不衛生，其實，他那裏知道，塞飽他肚子的一切食料，正需要，也正是這些不衛生的糞便培植出來的。因爲糞便中含氯最多，合於植物的需要。我們看見這些糞便洒在泥土之上，過幾天，便不見了，而土中的植物却欣欣地長大起來。這時，若我們加以仔細的考察，便知道這些糞便先要醞釀，腐爛，變成爲別的物質以後，植物才去吸收，使這糞便腐爛變質的，卽是前面所稱爲功臣的細菌。細菌的能力惟在能使物　腐爛，這在人體上固然有害，但在農業上却比牛馬的功勞還大。糞中的氯氣是包藏在結構複雜的化合物中的，所以細菌走來，以它的大力使糞便腐爛之後，其中所含的物質各各分解，分解之後，再各各化合，然後才變成硝酸鹽類的東西，給植物來取用。</p>
<p>七壤之有肥瘠的分別，就在淤這腐爛的東西多不多，廣大的沙漠沒有出產，卽是細菌不喜在那兒生長，腐植質缺乏的緣　。這種腐植質沒有一定的成分，可是我們經化學的實騐，知道是由生物及礦物質和合而成，總之是有　物質，含蛋白質最多，可是，單有這些腐植質，沒有細菌的力量　帮助牠，　，化合，於農作物仍是毫無裨益的。因爲腐植質在未分解之前，結構異　複雜，植物不能直接吸取，必須要細菌來醞釀，腐爛，由複雜而成節單的物質，再經幾度細菌的醞釀作用，使這蛋白質中的氮與他種物質化合，成爲硝酸鉀或硝酸鎂，這些物質才能使植物孳長發達起來。</p>
<p>這種情形，只要看豆科植物的牛活，如豌豆，苜蓿等，便可以知道細菌是使農產豐收的功臣的話决不是假的。我們若拔起一棵豌豆來看，在那些鬚根上是不是有着千千萬萬瘤形的東西，小的若芥子，大的如豌豆？如果設法將這些小瘤摘去，那棵豌豆樹便要漸漸枯萎，而結的豆子也就又小又少了。這些小瘤是什麽？便是一包一包的細菌。</p>
<p>豆子的生長必需要有大量的氮氣，卽是需要大量的植物中的蛋白質，空氣中的氮雖然很多，但植物自己無法自由吸取，而豌豆鬚根上的瘤却有這副本，它能將空氣中大量的氯一手抓來送給豆樹做養料去。</p>
<p>豆根上的細菌不單能助長豆樹的生長，而且還能使瘠土變爲肥壞。美國意利諾有個農塲，有一决爲試騐細菌對於士壞的功效，他們特意將農塲劃爲A，B，C三塊地方，A地專種玉蜀黍，B地種麥或黍，逐年輪流，C地則或黍，或麥，或首蓿，每年更換，依决循環。二十八年之後，三地玉蜀黍每畝之產量，於A地爲二十英斛，B地三十六英斛，C地則有五十九英斛，較之A地的竟多了一倍以上！這就是豆根上細菌的功勞。</p>
<p>細菌對於植物最有用的，計有兩種，一種是亞硝酸菌，能將物質腐爛後所產牛的亞母尼亞臭氣製造成亞硝酸鹽，二是硝酸菌，牠能將腐植質中蛋白質的氯取來造成爲硝酸鹽。</p>
<p>近世科學昌明，十壤改造家常翹起大拇指盛誇他的肥料的功効，其實一切肥料都不過是有着大量氮氣的化合物而已，而這些氮也正和空氣中的氮一樣，若沒有細菌的帮助，是絕對達不到植物的身上去的。</p>
<p>植物的生長，除了炭，氫，氧，氮，之外，還要鈣，鎂，鉀，硫，燐，氮，鐵等。但這决不是將化學室中看見的那些原質洒下地去，植物能孳牛的，因爲無論那一種原質都須要經過細菌的醞釀，腐爛和製造過了才能合用。</p>
<p>因着我國今年各省各地都吿豐收，鄉下人便紛紛進廟燒香，感謝菩薩的保佑，他們不知道使今年豐收的惟一的功臣—細菌—却仍然在銷聲匿跡地在地下繼繼牠們的工作呢！</p>

<h3 id="c219">左拉與法國人民 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 石孚</p>
<p>在本年法國小說作家愛米爾左拉逝世紀念那一天，法蘭西文藝界特在巴黎附近美唐城左拉生前別莊內，開會表示紀念，由敎育部長才的翰主持紀念儀式並發表演說。略謂「政府方設法以謀改善勞動階級之運命。夫法國勞工階級，有節儉和平之美德，此惟左拉知之最深，亦且愛之最甚。」左拉是自然主義的百要，他在某些地方雖然同情於法國一般人民和勞動者，但最後說來，他所描畫的仍然是法國市民一照自已的模型所創造的那個世界」，他自身仍然是市民　家。現在，法國以社會黨爲主的人民戰綫政府，法國的一羣進步的文學作者，特別開會來紀念他，並說他是最愛法國勞動者的人，這一看好像是很難解釋的事，但仔細考究起來，那意義却是很明瞭的。</p>
<p>左拉是活動於十九世紀後半期的法國作家，他所表現的便是第二帝政及第三共和時代的法國社會。比較起弗羅貝　，莫泊桑乃至一切自然主義作家來，他是更正視現實，更努力將眞理「赤裸裸表現出來」的。他無情地暴露了當時法國貴族的墮落生活，斥責們「把娼婦，街頭女當作民族之花」（「娜娜」）。對於都市市民和農村地中的貪欲（如「巴黎之腹和「士地」），對於交易所中一羣人物的欺詐（「金錢」），對於「買壞牛肉，可是用花來裝飾棹子」的小市民的可憐亦復可笑的虛榮生活（沸騰的鍋」），他都生動地表現了　來。他反對榨取行爲，表同情於動勞大衆，這是在「炭坑夫」和　勞動中可以明白看到的。爲了描寫普法戰爭的慘狀，他曾創作了「敗軍」；在這中問，我們可以看到他的反戰意識，雖然不很鮮明，不很徹底。</p>
<p>一八八四年，法國當局在瘋狂的反猶太入意識支配之下，竟自卑汚地偽造了一些事實，指猶大系法國入德來凡斯砲兵大尉有出黃軍事機密與德國人的嫌疑。於是，便爆發了法國歷史上有名的德來凡斯事件，也可說是反猶太人，所謂「猶太人禍」的事件。在這事件中，法國的政黨分成了兩大陣營：一方面是保皇黨等反猶太人的勢力，他們不僅硬說德來凡斯大尉有罪，而且根本反對共和政體；另一方面則是急進社會黨和社會黨的陣營，他們不僅揭穿了常局陷害德來凡斯的陰謀，向反對猶太人的狂徒抗議，而且爲保護共和政體而奮鬥。偉大的作家左拉正生活於這時的法國，對於震動全國的這個事件當然要表示他的意見，於是他寫了一篇論文爲德來凡斯大尉伸寃，斥　反猶太入運動的無理。可是，這結　觸怒了法國常局，馬上下令要逮捕他，甚至使他不得不亡命英國，直到大尉的寃屈事件大白後，才能重返故里。——我們爲什麽不　煩地在這裏述說這件事呢？那便是因爲在這事件中可以充分看出左拉是如何地愛護眞理和正義，更可以看出他的行動，他的實生活是如何地與他那創作態度一致。</p>
<p>一般說來，對於這樣的左拉，當時法國有自覺的市民還是很愛護的，因爲他們的社會在那時還有繼續發展的可能，他們的生活還有前途，因之他們還能相常地正視現實，還不至於仇視那樣描寫客觀現實的左拉；而且，左拉雖然描畫了法國市民生活的醜惡面，但他却是「在市民的道德中去找尋市民的缺點之補救」的（柯根敎授對他的評語），這對於眞正有敎養的巿民不消說是應該特別稱贊他的。因此，在當時仇視左拉者並不是法國市民，而是法國的貴族，保守派和敎會等等。例如天主敎詩人巴爾赫，多爾維利，便說他是「卑劣的藝術家」，嘲笑他是「爛污的米格蘭紀羅」。</p>
<p>現在呢？資本主義已走上了最後的死亡階段，在歷史的行程中，市民階層也和十九世紀的貴族一樣，成爲了不敢正視現實的人羣。這在觀念形態方面表現出來的，便是尼采的超人哲學，新的英雄主義，神秘主義，代替了科學眞理和自由主義與現實主義。於是，畏懼現實，反對民主和自由，反對猶太人的，在這時便不是已經被歷史的車輪碾碎了的貴族，而是企圖以最後的努力來阻止歷史車輪前進的市民民。這種情形在德國和意大利表現得特別顯然。至於法國的情形雖與德意的有些不同，但那里的金融資本家，軍事工業者，交易所中的投機份子，洛克大佐（火十字團的領袖）的黨徒，現在却正承繼着十九世紀法國貴族的地位，跟隨在德國希先生的屁股後面，努力反對共和政體，反對和平主義，反對猶太入，企圖以新的英雄主義和尼采的神秘主義來與眞理正義爲敵。像這樣的法國大市民，如果把左拉全部的文學遺產擺在他們面前，他們是絕不能接受的；在這時，能够宣揚他那正視現實，愛好眞理和正義的精神者，只有法國的勞動者和進步的人民。因此，紀念左拉並給與他最高評價的，並不是法蘭西的大市民，倒反而是法國的人民陣綫和一般進步作家了。</p>
<p>自然，說左拉知法國勞動者「最深」並「愛之最甚」，那是未免評價過高的。從各方面看來，我們都只能說他是進步的市民作家，是改良主義者，因他雖描寫資本卞義社會的黑暗面，但他却並未根本否定那社會制度，更不知道由什麽人用什麽方法來改革那社會。社會黨入之過高地評價他，其原由也許正在這里吧。不過，對於眞能擔負新的歷史任務的人羣，却是要批判地來接受左拉之一切的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Major Incident Occurs in Xi'an Yesterday; Zhang Xueliang's Troops Suddenly Change; Central Leaders Hold Emergency Meeting Late at Night; National Government Orders Zhang Xueliang to be Stripped of His Duties and Severely Punished; Chiang Kai-shek Kidnapped in Xi'an; Westbound Trains on Longhai Railway Stop at Tongguan; Telegraph Communications with Xi'an Cut Off <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Telegraph communications with Xi'an have been cut off since the morning of December 12. Subsequently, it was reported that Zhang Xueliang led a mutiny, using coercion near Lintong, and simultaneously issued a public telegram advocating the overthrow of the government. The telegram explicitly stated that he was giving Chiang Kai-shek a final warning and would temporarily detain him in Xi'an, among other things. Upon receiving the report, the Central Government held a joint emergency meeting of the Central Standing Committee and the Central Political Committee at 11:30 PM that evening. Those present included Ding Weifen, Chen Guofu, Feng Yuxiang, Ye Chucang, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Zhang Ji, Sun Ke, Fang Zhi, Chen Lifu, Zhang Qun, Wu Dingchang, Zhu Jiahua, Zhang Jia'ao, Chen Bijun, Zhang Daofan, Zhang Lisheng, Li Liejun, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Cheng Qian, Deng Jiayan, Chen Shaokuan, Zeng Yangfu, Liang Hancao, Chen Bulei, Wang Luyi, Chen Gongbo, Ma Chaojun, etc. Ding Weifen chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Resolutions: 1. The Executive Yuan will be the responsibility of Vice President Kong. 2. The Standing Committee of the Military Affairs Commission will be increased to five to seven members, with He Yingqin, Cheng Qian, Li Liejun, Zhu Peide, Tang Shengzhi, and Chen Shaokuan newly appointed as Standing Committee members. 3. Meetings of the Military Affairs Commission will be the responsibility of Vice Chairman Feng and the Standing Committee members. 4. The command and deployment of troops will be the responsibility of He Yingqin, Minister of Military Affairs and a Standing Committee member of the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<p>(2) It was resolved that Zhang Xueliang should first be stripped of all his concurrent posts and handed over to the Military Affairs Commission for severe punishment, and that his troops should be placed under the direct command of the Military Affairs Commission. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 12th stating that Zhang Xueliang's telegram of the 12th reporting his act of national betrayal is extremely regrettable. It was found that this member did not perform his duties well, and the Central Government had originally shown leniency and hoped for future service. However, at a time when foreign aggression is urgent and the suppression of bandits is about to be completed, he has kidnapped the commander and made reckless claims. This member, who bears the important responsibility of suppressing bandits, is acting like a bandit himself. As a soldier, he has offended his superior, which is a violation of the law and discipline. Zhang Xueliang should first be stripped of all his concurrent posts and handed over to the Military Affairs Commission for severe punishment, and his troops should be placed under the direct command of the Military Affairs Commission. This order must be strictly obeyed and not violated. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to information received here tonight, the provincial army in Xi'an stirred up trouble this morning, with some problems occurring. Chiang Kai-shek had just left Xi'an for Huaqing Pool last night. After hearing the alarm, he returned to the province this afternoon to restore order. Initially, the general public was quite concerned about Chiang's safety. It is now known that Chiang is safe and sound. The mutineering soldiers are part of the Northwest Communist Suppression Army. It is said that their aim is to demand a return to the Northeast to serve. Westbound trains on the Longhai Railway are currently stopping at Tongguan. Telegraph communications between Xi'an and the capital have also been temporarily cut off. The number of mutineering soldiers is unknown. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Government leaders held an emergency meeting tonight to discuss the serious situation caused by the mutiny of the army in Xi'an and the detention of Chiang Kai-shek there. It is reported that the immediate cause of the mutiny was the suspicion that a certain unit had communicated with the Communists.</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram: A certain military department's deputy chief of staff [redacted], and senior staff officer [redacted], concluded a military conference held at Jiabusi. On the 11th, they fled with Prince De, Zhuoshai, Bao Yueqing, and others to meet [redacted] Chief of Staff to conduct final negotiations. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining Telegram: The war in northern Sui has come to an end, and the focus has shifted to eastern Sui. If our army does not advance, the bandits and puppets will resist by occupying Shangdu and Jiabusi. They will continue to harass us after a certain military department outside the Pass officially launches its operations. Recently, the authorities in northern Sui have decided on two measures: (1) to resettle refugees and pacify the local area; (2) to reorganize the surrendered units and turn them into a strong force to defend against the enemy. A telegram has been sent to Yan and Chen to discuss and decide on implementation methods. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jihai Telegram: Starting from the 10th, the Japanese garrison troops stationed at the Great Wall have undergone a major redeployment. So-called elite troops are concentrating towards Chifeng Weichang and will advance westward within the week. (Special Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>Zhangbei: Prince De is holding important meetings with personnel from a certain special service agency in the West Sunite Banner for several days. The Mongolian troops under Zhuoshai are concentrating towards Pangjiang, and Bao Yueqing's troops are concentrating north of Shangdu. Prince De is scheduled to go to Jiabusi on the 14th.

<h3 id="e27">Proposed Measures for Renewing Old Mining Licenses <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry is now proposing measures to handle old mining licenses that existed before the implementation of the Mining Law and have not been renewed after the deadline for renewal and exchange of licenses on May 31, 1934. For those who apply for renewal after the renewal period deadline, they should be ordered to pay additional application fees and license fees in accordance with the new application regulations, and there should also be distinctions, in order to facilitate inspection and license renewal. However, a strict investigation should still be conducted to determine whether any of the unrenewed mines have any of the circumstances listed in Article 41 of the Mining Law. If so, their mining rights should be revoked in accordance with the law, so that those mines that have delayed renewal for a long time can be decisively closed down within a reasonable period, and all mining licenses can be unified. Currently, these handling measures have been communicated by the ministry to the provincial and municipal governments for implementation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding administrative plans and budget reports, the Executive Yuan has now stipulated methods and ordered implementation. Starting from the next fiscal year, the administrative plans of provincial and municipal governments must be submitted to the Yuan in 30 copies before the deadline for submitting budget estimates stipulated in the budget regulations, so that they can be approved early and there is a basis for reviewing the budget estimates. The administrative plans of various ministries, commissions, and agencies should also be submitted to the Yuan in 30 copies for approval before the date stipulated in Article 22 of the budget regulations (i.e., January 15). Furthermore, a review of the administrative plans of the various ministries, commissions, and agencies and the provincial and municipal governments shows that they have not been divided into monthly progress, making it impossible to compare them with the monthly work reports. Starting from the next fiscal year, the items listed in the administrative plans of various agencies should indicate the month of implementation. If an item cannot be completed within one month, the start and end months and progress should be indicated. In addition, in the monthly work reports thereafter, the items listed in the administrative plan and the work progress comparison table should detail the items listed in the original administrative plan for evaluation.

<p>(Nanjing) The case in which various sectors of the Guangdong military and government jointly telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance requesting exemption of import tax on foreign rice has aroused opposition from commercial groups in Hubei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces. It is now known that the responsible department of the Ministry of Finance has collected opinions from all parties and studied the case in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan, and has proposed solutions, which have been submitted to Minister Kong for approval. According to sources familiar with the grain situation, Guangdong's grain shortage has traditionally relied on the import of foreign rice for regulation. However, Hunan has always been a rice-producing area, and this year there is a bumper harvest with surplus grain to supply the needs of neighboring provinces. Moreover, the Guangdong-Hankou Railway is now open to traffic, making transportation between Hunan and Guangdong convenient. The situation is different from the past. Therefore, after receiving the telegram from Guangdong Province requesting exemption of import tax on foreign rice, the Executive Yuan immediately ordered the Ministry of Railways to quickly set special prices for transporting Hunan rice to Guangdong and ordered the Hunan Provincial Government to quickly plan relief measures to facilitate the sale of Hunan rice in Guangdong, which should be implemented within the shortest possible time so that the economies and food supplies of Hunan and Guangdong provinces can be mutually regulated and no longer rely solely on foreign rice. Although the Ministry of Finance has not yet announced its attitude towards exempting import duties on foreign rice in the future, it will certainly not exceed the scope determined by the Executive Yuan.

<p>(Nanjing) According to relevant sources, the number of overseas Chinese residing in Malaya is the largest, ranking first among the population of Malaya. However, from 1931 to 1934, the Federation was hit by the recession, and more and more overseas Chinese returned to China, causing a sharp decline in population. By 1935, it had gradually recovered. According to a survey, the overseas Chinese population in Malaya last year still ranked first among the Federation's population, totaling 737,440 people. Malays ranked second with 649,440 people, and Indians ranked third with 397,582 people. The total population of the Federation was 1,813,714 people. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e32">Guizhou People's Representatives Petition to Restore the Old System of Joint Salt Sales by Three Factories; Meet with He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, and Others; Ministry of Finance Orders the Sichuan Salt Transport Commissioner to Investigate and Reply <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Shuxun and other representatives of the people of Guizhou stated that 80-90% of Guizhou's edible salt is supplied by Sichuan Province, which has traditionally been jointly sold by factories in Fugong and Congjian. In 1930, the factories took advantage of the past benefits of the Sichuan Province defense zone and requested exclusive sales of Yong'an salt, raising prices year by year. Over the past six years, price increases and exploitation have amounted to no less than 2.4 million yuan, causing the people of Guizhou to suffer unspeakably from salt, and there is a risk of running out of salt. They came to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Finance and the Salt Bureau to restore the old system of joint long-distance sales by the three factories, so that salt prices could be reduced. They also met with He Yingqin, Wang Boqun, Gu Zhenglun, and others to request their united assistance. The Ministry of Finance agreed to order the Sichuan Salt Transport Commissioner Miao Qiujie to investigate and deliberate on a reply. A Sichuan telegram also stated that Salt Transport Commissioner Miao presented to the Ministry of Finance that the exclusive sales of Yong'an salt have a significant impact on the suffering of the people of Guizhou, the national tax revenue, and exclusive price gouging. The case should be revoked, the joint sales of the three factories should be restored, and sales should be promoted according to the old practice, so that the price of salt would naturally be reduced. The petition of Yan and others has already had results. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>

The purpose of this trip was to survey the progress of the main roads along the Beijing-Yunnan highway. The journey was quite dangerous and involved special engineering, but with the concerted efforts of officials, gentry, and people from all over the country, it has been transformed into a broad road. It is indeed a pleasure to be able to travel thousands of miles from Beijing to Yunnan by car. They will stay in Yunnan for three or four days and then return to Beijing in the same car. On the 12th, the Highway Bureau invited Qian and others to visit the Anning Hot Springs. On the 13th, they will pay respects to Long Yun. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Overview of the Suiyuan War – Conversation with a Foreigner After Inspection – National Army's Defense Works are Exceptionally Solid <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence, A foreigner from Peiping recently went to Suiyuan for inspection and traveled through Guihua, Pingdiquan, Zhuozishan, Bailingmiao, and eastern Suiyuan. He returned to Peiping on the 5th. According to his observations and experiences:</p>
<p>In eastern Suiyuan, when the war first started, there was only one company of local militia in Honggertu. At that time, the puppet bandits attacked with 300 men, but they were all repelled by this one company of militia. About half a day later, reinforcements began to arrive. Since the Chinese army completed its deployment, a certain party has led puppet bandits to attack Taolin and Xinghe along the border several times, but all failed. At present, the fortifications built by the Chinese army are very solid. According to military experts, if the current puppet bandits attack eastern Suiyuan alone, they will definitely not succeed. Even if there is external force involved, it will not be easy to succeed.</p>
<p>In northern Suiyuan, when Bailingmiao was previously occupied by a certain party, a huge sum of money was spent on building defense works that were exceptionally solid. Now that it has been recovered by the Chinese army, it has been further strengthened. At present, it is as stable as Mount Tai. In addition, the terrain near the area is surrounded by mountains. If the puppet bandits advance from eastern Suiyuan, it is more than 300 li of dry road, and it will take the army three to five days to arrive. If they counterattack Bailingmiao from Jiabusi or Pangjiang, the mountain roads in the northeast are rugged, making military travel even more difficult. Moreover, the existing bandits and puppets are only a few remnants, which can be easily resolved by the Chinese army in one fell swoop. Recently, aircraft from a certain party have occasionally come to drop bombs, but all the aircraft are not fighters. In order to prevent being shot down by the Chinese army's anti-aircraft guns, they dare not fly low, so the bombs dropped are mostly ineffective and the Chinese army has not suffered much damage. The Chinese army in Bailingmiao is very calm. Although the two armies in the front lines of eastern and northern Suiyuan are in confrontation, the city of Suiyuan is still very peaceful. The general residents are very excited, and the movement to comfort the soldiers is widespread throughout the region. From the outbreak of the war until now, large numbers of troops have never been seen passing through the city, so the residents have no war panic. Chairman Fu Zuoyi directs military affairs day and night and occasionally goes out on patrol in plain clothes. He personally receives representatives from all over the country who come to offer condolences and promises special care to students. Grain and fodder in the front are very sufficient. The fighting soldiers are very grateful for the generous contributions of the people in the rear and have established a committee to collect condolences from all parties. Representatives selected by the army, divisions, and brigades participate, and everything is extremely open. However, the items donated by all parties must be sent in large quantities. If they are sent sporadically, they may not be distributed equally. As for grain and fodder, they are piled up like mountains in the front and rear. It is said that the Chinese army in Suiyuan is powerful and aircraft have indeed arrived in Suiyuan, but the number is unknown. On the 3rd of this month, Chinese army aircraft set out for reconnaissance. As for the bandits' plan, they are now concentrated in Damaozi, on the one hand, trying to counterattack Bailingmiao, and on the other hand, trying to cover Pangjiang and Shangdu, but the counterattack has already failed, and the second attempt has been destroyed by the current actions of the Chinese army. It is now known that the Chinese army has a large number of troops moving towards the front, which will clear northern Suiyuan and then besiege Shangdu to eliminate the bandits.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Awarding of the Nobel Prize <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to a report from the Guomin News Agency in Stockholm yesterday, this year's Nobel Prizes were awarded in Oslo and Stockholm on the 10th by King Gustav V of Sweden in person. Among those attending the award ceremony were the laureates for Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine. Only Eugene O'Neill, the laureate for Literature, and Carl von Ossietzky, the laureate for the 1935 Peace Prize, did not attend in person. O'Neill was ill, and his prize was accepted by the U.S. Minister to Sweden on his behalf. Ossietzky was still in Germany, and because he could not attend in person, Professor Stein gave a brief speech to introduce this honored laureate. According to Swedish newspapers, this was an unprecedented eulogy for a Nobel Peace Prize laureate.</p>
<p>Among all the Nobel Prizes, the Literature Prize and the Peace Prize have always received the most attention, because literature has a particularly wide circulation in the world. When a writer wins this prize, his works will be read by people all over the world even more. As for the Peace Prize, it is naturally of greater concern to everyone because the issue of peace is related to the tranquility and happiness of people all over the world, especially at a time when the clouds of war are looming everywhere.</p>
<p>However, in the world's concern for the Nobel Peace Prize, Carl von Ossietzky, who could not go to Sweden to receive the Peace Prize in person, is a particularly worthy person for us to care about. Professor Stein's speech for him had a special reason. Why? In the past, the figures who won the Nobel Peace Prize were those who had gained prestige and status in politics, such as the British politicians Chamberlain and Henderson, the writer Norman Angell, and the Argentine Foreign Minister Lamas, who won the prize this year. However, Ossietzky was not such a figure. He was an unknown writer. He would only advocate peace in newspapers. He was also a criminal. He had been convicted of advocating peace since 1931. For the past three years, he had been living in Germany's dark concentration camps. He was already physically and mentally ill. But because of his resolute belief in peace, in this war-torn world, there were finally many people who knew him, did not forget him, and worked hard to rescue him, publicizing internationally that the Peace Prize should be awarded to him. A booklet published in England in September this year, entitled "What Has He Done?", written by fifteen famous scholars and writers such as Huxley, Wells, Macaulay, and Priestley, was a call for him. As a result, he was released. And the Nobel Prize Committee actually decided to award him the Peace Prize for last year. However, this fortunate news brought about an unfortunate result. The German authorities considered it an insult that Ossietzky had won the Peace Prize. On the one hand, they protested to the Nobel Prize Committee, and on the other hand, they detained the frail Ossietzky. As a result, at this Nobel Prize award ceremony, this glorious laureate could not be seen.</p>
<p>Being punished for peace, being robbed for peace, is an inevitable phenomenon in the current era of war-torn world. However, from this point alone, it can also be seen that those who work hard for peace are valuable.</p>

<p>(Argentine Capital) U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced today that the American Peace Conference has completed its main tasks, and the plan to maintain peace has been agreed upon by the twenty-one republics of the Americas. This plan can be submitted to the Plenary Session for a vote on December 15, and its content includes (1) neutrality, (2) general security, and intercontinental security.

However, the preservation of American peace and the immediate start of consultation and cooperation among American countries when faced with threats will be retained. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e51">The Accession of the New British Monarch George VI; Proclamation Read by the Privy Council; Ministers Swear Allegiance <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(London) This morning at St. James's Palace, in the presence of the Accession Council, George VI was formally proclaimed King of Great Britain and Emperor of India. When the new monarch arrived at the palace, he was wearing the uniform of an Admiral of the Fleet. He slowly ascended the red and yellow throne. Those attending the ceremony were all dressed in formal attire or official uniforms, creating a rather grand spectacle. Guests were welcomed by the Duke of Norfolk. Nearly all three hundred members of the Privy Council were in attendance. Among the first to arrive were Prime Minister Baldwin and the Lord Mayor of London.</p>
<p>Those present openly proclaimed: "We, therefore, with one heart and one soul, and with the blessing of God, do hereby proclaim Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George to be King, by the title of George VI. To whom we do acknowledge all faith and all obedience with humble affection; beseeching God by whom Kings and Queens do reign, to bless His Majesty with long and happy Years to reign over us."</p>
<p>Subsequently, members of the Privy Council, as well as representatives from various Dominions and India, swore allegiance. A new Privy Council was then formed. The first act of the new monarch upon accession was, according to custom, to issue a decree to the Privy Council. Following this, he took an oath to safeguard the security of the Church of Scotland.</p>
<p>The proclamation of the new monarch and the swearing of allegiance commenced this morning and were broadcast via radio throughout the Empire. Sunday marks the new monarch's forty-first birthday, and many places throughout the Empire have announced a day of holiday. Tomorrow, churches will offer prayers for the new King George VI and the Empire.</p>
<p>This afternoon, when the new monarch was proclaimed, the number of spectators was even greater than during the accession of the abdicated King Edward VIII in January of this year. Despite the cold weather, many people took advantage of the Saturday half-day holiday to visit. At 3:00 PM, the Lord Chamberlain stood on the balcony of St. James's Palace and read the proclamation of the new monarch's accession. This proclamation was also read separately at the Exchange and three other locations.</p>
<p>According to official sources, the coronation of the new King George VI and the new Queen Elizabeth is scheduled for May 12th of next year, which is the date originally set for the coronation of the abdicated king. (Reuters and Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) It is not yet known when the new King and Queen will move to Buckingham Palace. Public opinion suggests that the King will follow the practice of the previous King and visit the palace daily for several months to handle state affairs after his accession. The new King and Queen had previously decided to spend Christmas with the Queen Mother at Sandringham. Newspapers now believe that this plan will not be changed due to the accession. The new King's schedule for the coming year is a matter of great concern to both the government and the public. To what extent the new King will follow the schedule set by the previous King is a topic of much discussion. There is good reason to expect that the new King will formally tour India next winter, according to the previous King's plans.</p>
<p>The House of Commons is scheduled to convene this afternoon to swear allegiance to the new King. The adjournment of today's session will be early. This ceremony will be completed next Monday.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will bring the new King's edict to the House of Commons on Monday evening and will propose a response. On Tuesday, the House of Commons will resume its regular business and is scheduled to adjourn on the 18th for the Christmas holidays. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The new Queen Elizabeth, originally named Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon, is the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, a noble Scottish family with fourteen generations of distinguished ancestors. She is the third daughter and was born in London on August 4, 1900. On April 26, 1923, she married the Duke of York. The British people greatly admire her because their union was based on love, not on considerations of social status. The Queen has two daughters. The elder, Elizabeth, was born on April 21, 1926, and is now the heir apparent. The younger, Margaret Rose, was born on August 21, 1930. The Queen is known for being kind and approachable, without any pretense, and is deeply loved by the British and the people of the British Empire. She is most popular for her ability to manage her household well and is considered a virtuous wife and mother. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) According to official sources, the new monarch's title has been decided as George VI, and not Albert I. This is because Queen Victoria, during her reign, had a husband named Albert and specifically instructed that the name Albert should not be used as a monarchical title in the future. This time, the new King's accession and change to George VI is in accordance with Victoria's will. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Portsmouth The abdicated King Edward has departed the country aboard the destroyer HMS Fury after midnight. The Prince arrived by car, accompanied by one police car and two baggage cars. Upon arrival, he proceeded to the waterfront to board the ship and depart. The destroyer HMS Wakeful is also set to depart tonight, but the Prince did not transfer to that ship. According to the Daily Mail, the Prince is headed to Gibraltar. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) The abdicated King Edward, now titled "Mr. Windsor," left the country early this morning. His whereabouts are kept secret, and no one knows where he is going. Last night, in his capacity as King, he approved the Act of Abdication, which was his final act as monarch. A few hours later, he traveled by car to Portsmouth and boarded a destroyer. Half an hour later, the ship set sail, escorted by the destroyer HMS Wolfertone, which carried many pieces of luggage. It is reported that "Mr. Windsor" is accompanied by his Equerry, Lieutenant Colonel Piers Legh, who is also his private detective and a member of the royal household. The abdicated king arrived at Portsmouth from Windsor Castle by car after midnight. The car curtains were drawn, and several other cars, laden with luggage, followed behind. His attendants waited for him at the dock. Dock officials were sworn to secrecy regarding the abdicated King's movements and destination. However, HMS Wolfertone had already been prepared and was awaiting him. As the abdicated King's car passed through the dock entrance, the ship quietly pulled alongside the pier. The police officers on duty, clearly aware of who was in the car, allowed it to enter without hindrance. No one was allowed to enter with the car. It was heard that before the abdicated King boarded the HMS Trenchant yacht, he spoke briefly with Admiral Fisher. The battleship HMS Nelson was seen in the distance, illuminated by electric lights, and the cruiser HMS Neptune was also docked nearby. While the luggage was being loaded onto HMS Wolfertone, the ship's crew was extremely active. The abdicated King held a farewell banquet at Windsor Castle last night, attended by his younger brother, the new King George VI, his mother, Queen Mary, his younger brother, the Duke of Gloucester, his uncle, the Duke of Athlone, and several princesses. Those present felt a deep sense of sadness and farewell. The new Queen Elizabeth was unable to attend due to a mild cold and the cold weather. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) After delivering a farewell address to the nation via radio last night, the abdicated King Edward hurriedly said goodbye to his relatives and old friends. He then quietly left London by car with his adjutant, Captain Piers Legh. At that time, the car traveled through the suburbs, and all was silent. The person in the car was alone and solitary. His departure, wherever he may go, is like a wild cloud or a free crane, which is much more carefree than those who manage countless affairs of state every day. Around midnight, the car arrived at the "Unicorn Gate" of the Portsmouth Naval Dockyard. Local officials had been instructed in advance to maintain strict secrecy regarding the abdicated King's visit. The abdicated King shook hands and bid farewell to Admiral Fisher, the commander of the fortress. The Admiral, overcome with emotion, could not help but shed tears. At that time, it was late at night, and only a few naval soldiers held electric torches. Three cruisers were anchored outside the harbor, with their lights flickering faintly. Soon after, Admiral Fisher escorted the abdicated King away from the fortress headquarters and quietly boarded the ship. (Havas, 12th)</p>

<p>(London) According to reliable sources, the abdicated King is not going to Cannes, France, to meet Mrs. Simpson. Due to divorce law restrictions, Mrs. Simpson cannot meet with the abdicated King within five months. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) After approving the Act of Abdication, the abdicated King Edward quietly boarded a ship. In the evening, he went to Windsor Castle to be with the new King and the royal family, enjoying family happiness. At 10:29 PM, he departed. At approximately 10:00 PM, Windsor Castle staff announced to radio listeners, "His Royal Highness Prince Edward" will deliver a speech. The abdicated King then began his radio broadcast address, which was as follows:</p>
<p>"At long last I am able to say a few words of my own. I have never wanted to withhold anything, but until now, this has not been constitutionally possible. A few hours ago I discharged my last duty as King and Emperor, and now that I have been succeeded by my brother, the Duke of York, my first words must be to declare my allegiance to him. This I do with all my heart. You all know the reasons which have impelled me to renounce the throne. But I want you to understand that in making up my mind I did not forget the country or the Empire, which, as Prince of Wales and lately as King, I have always tried to serve. I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as King as I would wish to do without the help and support of the woman I love. And I want you to understand that I have made this, the most serious decision of my life, only upon the single thought of what would in the end be best for all. This was a judgment which I myself had to make, and which I alone could make. The other person most nearly concerned has tried all she could to persuade me to take a different course. I have made this decision with calm and full deliberation, and it has been, as it has always been, the single object of my life, to serve my people as best I could. There has been no constitutional crisis or friction between me and Mr. Baldwin or between me and Dominion Prime Ministers." And finally, "Perhaps one day I may return. And until then God bless you all. God save the King!" (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) Queen Mary has issued the following decree to the various territories of the Empire: "In this time of sorrow, looking at the circumstances around us, I cannot help but feel deeply moved. Therefore, I issue this decree to express my sincere gratitude to the people of the Empire. The death of the late King some time ago caused deep and immense pain. Less than a year has passed since then, and the grief has not yet left my heart. Now, another sudden change has occurred. How can I bear it? When my beloved son told me that he had to relinquish his responsibilities due to his duties, my motherly heart was broken. This situation need not be explained further. You all know how great a price my son paid for making this decision. In the past, my son served his country and the Empire with loyalty and diligence. You will never forget his virtues. Now, I especially recommend his younger brother, who unexpectedly and painfully acceded to the throne. I also urge you to give the new monarch as much loyalty as you gave to the late King and my eldest son. In this time of sorrow, I offer my most sincere prayers for the unity of our motherland and the Empire. May God bless our country, to become strong and prosperous. May He also bless you, guide you, and never abandon you." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Dublin Today, the Parliament of the Irish Free State passed two motions proposed by President de Valera by a vote of 79 to 54. These motions stipulate amendments to the constitution, effectively making the Irish Free State a republic in its internal affairs. The President explained that this clause, which restricts the King's power, would bring the law in line with the facts. Opposition leader Cosgrave then raised questions, to which the President replied that since Article 1 of the constitution had not been changed, the relationship between the Free State and the British Empire had not been severed. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Dublin The constitutional amendment bill for Southern Ireland proposed by Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, at a special parliamentary session, passed this afternoon by a vote of seventy-nine to fifty-four. The bill stipulates the abolition of the post of Governor-General of Southern Ireland, and the removal of the name of the British monarch from all internal affairs of the Irish Free State. Governor-General of Ireland, Sir Harry Verney, has indicated to the British government that the Irish Free State cannot agree to the procedural clauses of the Statute of Westminster regarding constitutional disputes between Britain and the Dominions. Therefore, Sir Harry decided to submit two proposals regarding the Irish constitution and foreign affairs, recognizing the new monarch, but restricting the British monarch's role in the administration of the Irish Free State in the future. De Valera declared that since the Irish Free State is combined with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa, and the British monarch is recognized by the aforementioned states, allowing them to appoint diplomatic and consular representatives and conclude international agreements, the Irish Free State will also recognize the British monarch's right to perform the same duties on behalf of the Irish Free State. The bill effectively means that the name of the British monarch will be removed from all internal political activities of the Irish Free State, retaining the British monarch's name only in matters of foreign affairs of the Irish Free State. As for the post of Governor-General, it will be abolished, and its duties will be assumed by the Speaker of Parliament. De Valera concluded by saying that the bill does not sever the relationship between the Irish Free State and the other federated states. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held a closed-door meeting at 11:00 AM today, which ended at 1:30 PM. It drafted a final resolution on the Spanish issue and scheduled a public meeting at 6:00 PM to debate it. The resolution contains the following items:</p>
<p>(1) The Spanish government's application is based on Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant, and its reason is entirely justified, as the Spanish Civil War is sufficient to cause a situation of international dispute.</p>
<p>(2) All countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and countries should maintain good relations with each other regardless of the political system adopted within other countries.</p>
<p>(3) Reference to Article 10 of the Covenant, which stipulates that member states should respect each other's political independence and territorial integrity. However, the wording is implicit and does not clearly point out the facts.</p>
<p>(4) The Council approves the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and supports the mediation proposal of Britain and France. The Council has rejected the proposal made by the Chilean representative that all personnel from the embassies and legations of various countries in Spain should be evacuated. However, the Chilean representative's proposal to find ways to humanize the Spanish Civil War has been included in the draft resolution. The League of Nations expects that the Council will vote on the draft resolution today and that there will be no difficulties. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations continued its meeting in the afternoon to discuss the Spanish situation. Lord Cranborne, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom, French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos, the representative of New Zealand, the Soviet Ambassador to France Potemkin, and the Polish representative Komarnicki successively delivered speeches. Lord Cranborne first stated that the interference of some countries in the Spanish Civil War has seriously endangered international peace. He also stated that although the tasks of the Non-Intervention Committee have not been fully accomplished, they have been of great help in maintaining peace. "However, it is also true that some countries have failed to absolutely comply with the Non-Intervention Agreement, resulting in repeated instances of violating the agreement and assisting both sides of the civil war." He finally mentioned the recent proposal by Britain and France to the governments of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and the Soviet Union to jointly mediate the Spanish Civil War, stating that although some of these countries have not yet replied, the British government will request these countries to cooperate in promoting international peace. Following this, Yvon Delbos spoke, stating that the plan to monitor the import of armaments into Spain has been drafted and completed by the Adjustment Committee and submitted to the legitimate government of Spain and the Burgos authorities. This monitoring plan urgently needs to be implemented immediately. As for the principle of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, it must be expanded to include the prohibition of volunteers from going to Spain for assistance. He concluded by hoping that the Council would rise up and support the proposal of Britain and France to mediate the Spanish Civil War. At this point, the representative of New Zealand spoke, stating that since the Council has convened a meeting for the Spanish situation, it must take immediate action. Subsequently, Potemkin delivered a speech, stating that the Soviet Union has always faithfully complied with the restrictions of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War and believes that in order to end the civil war in that country, the monitoring plan must be strictly implemented. Finally, he reiterated that the Soviet government has decided to participate in the proposal of the British and French governments and that the Council should support this proposal without reservation. However, the Polish representative Komarnicki stated that the Council must be very cautious and that any action that may cause new disputes should not be attempted lightly. He also said, "If the Council has not received a concrete application, it would be best to end the debate. Fortunately, Britain and France have already begun negotiations with the four most relevant countries, Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia." The Council adjourned at 7:25 PM and is scheduled to continue the meeting tomorrow afternoon. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that Britain has formally notified it of the suspension of the war debt payment of $117,670,765 due on the 15th of this month. The British government also stated that it is willing to reopen negotiations at an appropriate time. However, State Department officials declared that the United States has not taken action to reopen negotiations. (National Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>(Washington) British Ambassador to Washington Sir Ronald Lindsay delivered a reply from the British government to U.S. Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles today, stating that the war debt due on December 15th could not be paid. However, unlike previous notes, which stated that Britain was unable to pay the annual installments, this note stated, "The British government is willing to resume discussions with the United States when the opportunity arises to obtain a satisfactory result." Responsible parties here, considering the different wording of this year's note compared to those issued in previous years, hope that Britain will follow in France's footsteps and begin negotiating the war debt issue with the United States. The Finnish government has notified the U.S. government that it is willing to continue paying this year's installments. France had previously declared to the United States that it was willing to negotiate a settlement of the war debt issue, so the U.S. government is now waiting quietly for France to submit a solution.

<p>(Geneva) French representative to the Council of the League of Nations Yvon Delbos recently made a statement to the press, roughly stating that the current goals of the French government regarding the Spanish issue are twofold: the non-intervention agreement must continue to be implemented, and the international monitoring measures must be strengthened. This is one goal. Mediation should be undertaken by the relevant countries to implement a ceasefire in Spain. This is the second goal. Delbos believes that France's intentions are fully in line with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant and hopes that the League of Nations can support them. He also stated that in order to avoid international disputes, the governments of the relevant countries must act quickly. If some countries continue to supply arms and manpower to both sides of the Spanish Civil War, making the world regard the non-intervention agreement as a joke, then the great powers may have to reconsider their adopted positions.

It is generally believed that all future military operations will be personally directed by General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government. The Madrid government forces have built solid defense lines, and the Nationalist army has reorganized its attacking units and formed a machine gun network, with a machine gun team every twenty meters, which will be used to cover the army's attack.

This bombing was clearly a military action by the government army to attack the left flank of the Nationalist army when the enemy was unprepared due to the severe cold weather.

<h3 id="e68">The Course of Shi Yushan's Defection; Wang Ying Also Sent Representatives to Guihua, Falsely Claiming to Surrender; Two-Thirds of Wang's Troops Followed Shi in Defecting <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Suiyuan: During the last counterattack on Bailingmiao, the puppet bandit army mainly used Wang Ying's bandit troops. A certain side used automobiles to transport all of Wang's bandits to Bailingmiao, then drove the automobiles away, intending to place them in a hopeless situation to strengthen their will to fight. However, the snowy ground there stretched as far as the eye could see, and there was a lack of clothing and food. Suffering from hunger and cold, the soldiers had no fighting spirit. After our army launched an attack, the bandits scurried away at the mere sight of us. Lei Zhongtian, the commander of Wang's bandit vanguard, is said to have been killed in action. After the defeat, Wang Ying only had small detachments remaining under Shi Yushan, Su Meilong, etc. Wang Ying himself, after repeated defeats, retreated to the vicinity of Wulanhua, intending to surrender to our side and cut off our advance towards Damiaozi. Considering that they were thinking of repenting, and not wanting to sacrifice the coerced compatriots, we did not attack them. However, according to investigations, Wang Ying's surrender was not sincere. On one hand, he sent people to a certain side to explain that he was reorganizing his troops and requested that that side replenish his guns and military supplies. On the other hand, he also sent people to contact our side about surrendering, but to no avail. On the morning of the 8th, our army advanced to the area of Caowa (on the road from Wulanhua to Damiaozi). Wang Ying actually ordered Shi Yushan to lead his troops to counterattack. Shi then requested Wang Ying to allocate him a battalion of artillery. After Wang agreed, Shi Yushan immediately led three and a half regiments of Wang's troops (Wang Regiment, Liu Regiment, Cao Regiment) and a company of artillery to surrender to our side. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, they arrived at Wulanhua and met with Zeng Yan-yi, Deputy Commander of the 35th Army, and Sun Changsheng, Commander of the Cavalry Division. The results of the talks were very satisfactory. It is said that after Shi Yushan's defection, two-thirds of Wang Ying's bandit troops followed Shi in defecting. Wang Ying's remaining bandits number less than one-third. According to one account, Wang Ying currently has no more than a company of remaining bandit troops. Seeing that the situation was hopeless, Wang Ying also urgently sent his Chief of Staff, Kou Ziyan, to Guihua on the afternoon of the 8th to meet with our military authorities to discuss surrendering sincerely. He hurriedly left Guihua to report to Wang Ying. It is said that Shi Yushan and others, who defected this time, plan to issue a circular telegram in the next few days, announcing the process of their defection and their aspiration to serve the country and eliminate the bandits from now on. Our side believes that the defection of Wang Ying's troops is equivalent to the victory at Bailingmiao. In addition to the soldiers being encouraged and delighted, they are even more invigorated, believing that the Chinese people ultimately belong to China. Although they may be temporarily oppressed and unable to be free, if there is an opportunity, their conscience will still not be extinguished. (9th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Qingdao: Hints of Resolution in Sino-Japanese Negotiations; All Yarn Factories to Resume Work Uniformly on the 14th; Japanese Marines to Withdraw Within the Shortest Time <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao correspondence, The illegal action of the Japanese Marines landing in Qingdao has been seriously negotiated by Mayor Shen Honglie to the Japanese Consul General in Qingdao. At first, the Japanese Marines not only refused to withdraw but also made unreasonable demands to the municipal government, almost reaching a stalemate. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Third Fleet, Hasegawa Kiyoshi, arrived in Qingdao but did not meet with Mayor Shen. He only summoned his subordinate captains, the Consul General, Military Attaché Tajiri, Chief of Special Services Hagi, etc., to hold an important meeting on the Izumo warship to discuss countermeasures. It is said that the Japanese side has made six demands to the municipal government, and Mayor Shen has sternly rejected those that exceed the scope. At the same time, the municipal government also made five demands to the Japanese side: (1) The Japanese consulate apologizes to the municipal government in writing for the illegal actions of the Japanese sailors landing; (2) Return the important documents taken from the Party headquarters; (3) Compensate for the losses suffered by the Chinese side; (4) Immediately withdraw the landed Japanese Marines; (5) Guarantee that such incidents will not happen again in the future. It is said that the Japanese Consul General has agreed to the above items. The municipal government has also agreed to consider accommodating the Japanese demands. This matter can probably be resolved peacefully. On the evening of the 10th, Shen also held the final decisive talks with the Japanese Consul General. Agreements were reached on the measures for the resumption of work by the yarn factories and other related matters. The Japan Textile Industry Association and the directors of various yarn factories also held a joint meeting at noon on the 10th, which lasted four hours. There was a detailed discussion on the issue of starting work. It is said that the factory side has decided to start work uniformly on the 14th, and all the Japanese Marines stationed in various factories will gradually withdraw to their ships before the 15th.</p>
<h3 id="e70">No Good Policy Yet for Anti-Smuggling in North China; Sun Weidong Returns North to Convey the Ministry of Finance's Opinions; Losses of Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs This Year Amount to 20 Million; False East Hebei Government Illegally Establishes False Inspection Offices <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, The problem of anti-smuggling in North China is still pending resolution. After Sun Weidong, the Tianjin Customs Superintendent, returned north, he reported to Chairman Song in Beijing on the results of his consultations. If the Hebei-Chahar side has any suggestions, Sun will also forward them to the Ministry of Finance for further review and to develop an appropriate remedial measure. Therefore, the implementation of a new policy will be no earlier than next spring. Now, the opinions of the central government and the local governments are extremely consistent. That is, the previous misunderstandings have been completely eliminated through Sun Weidong's communication. When the Customs and the Directorate General of Smuggling Prevention for Road Transport are to promote anti-smuggling official duties in the future, the Hebei-Chahar authorities have already agreed to assist by local military and police agencies. However, before the diplomatic obstacles encountered by the Directorate General of Smuggling Prevention for Road Transport are resolved, it is still difficult to work in practice. Therefore, it is also difficult for Director General Pezzetta and Deputy Director Li Tonghua to come north for a while. Regarding the rumor that the Directorate General will move south, Sun Weidong solemnly denied it to the outside world after returning north. According to investigations from various parties, whether the Directorate General relocates depends on whether the anti-smuggling work can be carried out as desired and whether the diplomatic channels are opened. It seems premature to say that it is leaving now.</p>
<p>Since September of this year, after smugglers abandoned the use of railways and switched to highways, the rampant smuggling has been similar to the peak period in the spring and summer. On average, 100 to 150 truckloads of smuggled goods are shipped out of Tianjin every day. Recently, the weather has been cold, and the rivers have frozen over, cutting off shipping. Otherwise, dozens of civilian ships are also shipped out by water every day. The North-Ning Railway, faced with the situation, has to carry smuggled goods coming from the Eastern Hebei region. The Tianjin East Station Customs Anti-Smuggling Office has virtually abandoned its responsibilities in order to avoid trouble, allowing the ronin to transport the goods into a certain concession for storage. Therefore, the amount stored here is enough to be sold for more than half a year. In the future, the Bohai Bay will freeze, making it difficult for smuggled goods to land. Although there will be fewer coming, the smuggling in Tianjin is so much that it can still be sold as before. Therefore, the focus of anti-smuggling in the future lies in Tianjin. If Tianjin can effectively block smuggling, at least the areas of Eastern Hebei and Northern Shandong will not be harmed by the flood of smuggled goods. Due to the rampant smuggling, from January to the end of October this year, the customs revenue lost by the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs amounts to more than 16 million yuan. Although the losses in November and December have not been calculated, it is estimated that they will each be around 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan. Therefore, the lowest loss of customs revenue in North China this year must be around 20 million yuan. Last year, the total revenue of the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs was more than 39 million yuan. Compared to this year, the highest figure will probably not exceed 19 million yuan. Such a huge amount is truly heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Last year, the pseudo-East Hebei government illegally established pseudo-inspection offices in Beidaihe, Changli, and other places to collect import taxes on smuggled goods, called inspection fees. Starting in the spring of next year, it plans to use new regulations and revise the pseudo-tax rates. Not only will imported goods be taxed a quarter of the regular customs duties as inspection fees, but exported goods will also be released with reduced tax rates. As for its tax rules, they have been compiled using the pseudo-Manchukuo system and will be announced on New Year's Day. If there is still no solution to anti-smuggling in North China next spring, I am afraid that the rampant smuggling will be even worse than this year. The pseudo-organization has also forced British and American goods to take the path of smuggling recently. A notice was issued to British and American oil merchants that all types of oil sold in the Eastern Hebei region, regardless of whether they have paid Chinese customs duties, will be subject to a pseudo-inspection fee of 1.09 yuan per ten gallons (Chinese customs duty is 4.25 yuan per ten gallons). If unloaded at Qinhuangdao, it is not necessary to pay Chinese official taxes. Once the inspection fee is paid, it can be sold in the Eastern Hebei region. The oil merchants believe that the pseudo-government intentionally suppresses British and American oil merchants to help a certain country's private oil sales. In addition to requesting the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao Customs to find ways to stop this, they have also requested instructions from their respective head offices. Currently, the sales of British and American merchants in the pseudo-East Hebei region have been virtually abandoned. The customs authorities attach great importance to this matter and are waiting for the instructions of the Inspector General of Customs. (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Song Zheyuan Declares Four Prerequisites—Speech at a Tea Party for the Press <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, The work of suppressing bandits in Suiyuan is gradually developing, and the situation in North China is becoming increasingly serious. Song Zheyuan, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission, is paying even more attention to the current situation. Having been in charge of military and political affairs in Hebei and Chahar for nearly a year, he specially hosted a tea party for the press at the Political Affairs Commission's East Building at 10:00 AM on the 10th to report on the political situation of the past year and the attitude and direction of the future towards the current situation. More than 50 reporters attended. Qin Dechun, Jia Deyao, Liu Zhizhou, Deng Zhexi, Lei Sishang, Wang Shijiu, and Guo Zhihan were all in attendance to welcome them. It lasted for an hour before adjourning. The following is a record of Song's speech:</p>
<p>"I, Zheyuan, have been entrusted to preside over military and political affairs in Hebei and Chahar for nearly a year. During this year, although I have often met with you in the press, I have had few opportunities to speak freely due to the many political affairs. Now, at the end of the year, I have specially prepared tea and snacks to invite you to gather together to express my respect and to encourage each other and work hard for the country. Now is a time when the country is in trouble. I am deeply afraid of falling short of my responsibilities, as I am of meager virtue and scarce ability, burdened with heavy responsibilities. However, in handling all affairs, I have acted on the instructions of the central government and strived to take the four matters of the country, the people, the facts, and the suppression of communism as prerequisites. First, take the country as a prerequisite, because the country is formed by the concerted efforts of everyone. The strength of a country does not lie in having many soldiers, but in having strong people. Therefore, the first thing to do is to support righteousness to encourage the people's hearts, so that everyone can fulfill their responsibilities, be loyal to the country, and be loyal to the nation, eliminate selfish views, and seek the permanent welfare of the country. Second, take the people as a prerequisite, that is, to relieve the people's suffering, eliminate corruption, suppress bandits, and abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes. In the past year, we have continuously eliminated corruption. However, whether we have completely eliminated it is also related to politics. I believe that we can definitely go down this road. The bandits are also gradually being suppressed. Although we cannot leave our doors unlocked at night, we can still walk safely. We have tried our best to abolish excessive and miscellaneous taxes, and the main goal is to enable the people to live and work in peace. Third, take the facts as a prerequisite. I have always advocated telling the truth and doing practical things, striving for self-improvement, and overthrowing the mentality of dependence, doubt, and hypocrisy. I personally believe that the Chinese people all have patriotic ideas and are not bad people. Therefore, we should eliminate the above points, seek truth from facts, and strive to benefit the country and the nation, and walk together on one road to achieve the goal of saving the country. Fourth, take the suppression of communism as a prerequisite. The fallacies of communism confuse the world and are completely incompatible with the national conditions. In recent years, communist bandits have rioted, and their brutality exceeds that of bandits. If we want to save the country, we must first eliminate communism. We will never allow it to exist within the borders of Hebei and Chahar and will thoroughly eliminate it. The above four are the facts of the past and will also be the direction of the future. The press is a guiding organ of society. The development of the press is related to the enlightenment of the people, the improvement of society, the promotion of national policies, and the support of the public. It is hoped that you in the press will fulfill your social responsibilities, promote the historical mission, and not hesitate to give me guidance, deeply understand the difficulties of the times, and jointly maintain the overall situation. I am greatly honored." (10th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Grain Prices in Northern Anhui Remain Surprisingly High; Have Not Eased Due to Prolonged Drought; Disaster Has Taken Shape in Various Counties <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence, Since the end of October, due to drought and lack of rain in northern Anhui, tense situation, and scarce sources of miscellaneous grains, grain prices have risen step by step. The Bengbu authorities initially planned to suppress them and limit further rises. However, the established situation was impossible to reverse. Before long, the Anhui Provincial Government prohibited the export of food grains as a restrictive measure. However, with food grains unable to circulate freely, the grain market was virtually stagnant, and grain prices remained stiff. Although the central government subsequently implemented food grain regulation and prohibited restrictions on exports in order to balance supply and demand and provide relief, grain prices in northern Anhui remained firm due to the prolonged drought for a month and have not fallen back yet. There was light rain like silk on the 10th of this month, but the fields could not be thoroughly soaked. The market price of river bottom soybeans and wheat has not eased at all. The export of soybeans is surging, and flour mills are buying wheat as much as possible. The prices of various grains still have an upward trend. The recent market prices in Bengbu are: good quality Hehua wheat, 18 yuan; Shouzhou red wheat, 17 yuan 8 jiao 9; soybeans, 14 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen; high-grade rice, 18 yuan (the above are calculated per shi); and the price of first-class flour has risen to 4 yuan 3 jiao per bag. Families below the middle class, seeing the high cost of rice and firewood and the surprising prices of everything, are all complaining bitterly, feeling that their livelihoods are difficult. Moreover, disaster victims in various counties are forming groups to flee the famine. At this time of winter cold and drought, with the sowing of wheat overdue, a disaster has taken shape. The winter famine is more serious than the spring famine, which is truly worthy of attention. (11th)</p>

<p>The home of Zou Meiting, a farmer in Anqiao Village, the second district of the county, was suddenly robbed by bandits on the night of the 22nd of last month. Before leaving, they also kidnapped his second son, Fucheng. It was not until the day before yesterday that they received a letter from the bandits, stating the method and path of the gambling tickets. Zou immediately submitted the original letter to the Public Security Bureau. Director Dong immediately dispatched Detective Li of the Detective Squad, leading detective police and the victim, disguised, to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. According to the designated address, they joined forces with patrolmen and arrested four bandits. During interrogation, they confessed that the hostage was hidden in Yaoshan Township, Changshu. Detective Li then joined forces with Shanghai Public Security Bureau detectives and rushed to Changshu overnight, recovered the hostage, and arrested two bandits guarding the hostage, and brought them back to Shanghai. They confessed their names as Xie Changlin, Shi Xin-gen, Wang Xiulong, Min Chen, Duan Mingchen, and Yang Jinyuan, etc. The Kunshan County Public Security Bureau dispatched personnel to Shanghai on the 11th to escort the bandits and hostage back to the county for interrogation.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter, there have been frequent reports of robberies in urban and rural areas. A robbery also occurred in Xiangcheng Township the day before yesterday, with the homes of Xu Jiayu and Xu Buchang being robbed, as well as a bird gun. Moreover, the Hengchangxiang, Laidetang, Yongchunxiang, Wu Bomao, Zhao Xiemao, Zhengfengxiang, and eight other shops in Nijiawan Town, Huangdai Township, were robbed. Wang A-gen, Xue Qiuting, and Wang Jiayu were injured and six guns were taken from the head of the security corps. After robbing for about two hours, they escaped. The Huangdai Township Public Security Sub-bureau and Security Corps immediately dispatched teams to pursue the robbers, but were unsuccessful. County Magistrate Deng, upon receiving the report, ordered the Public Security Bureau and Security Corps on the 12th to dispatch teams separately to strictly investigate and punish the stolen goods and robbers. He also reported to the Winter Defense Committee, as well as the Second District of the Water Police. District Chief Zhou immediately dispatched warships to patrol Yangcheng Lake and other places to prevent bandits from fleeing to various villages. Director Song of the Winter Defense Office heard that he would implement the dispatch of teams to encircle and suppress bandits to maintain local security.</p>

<p>Recently, Suzhou has experienced a continuous shortage of rice and wheat, leading to gradual price increases. In just a few days, the price of rice has risen by more than one yuan, and the price of wheat has also risen by six or seven jiao. Because of this, various snacks that are necessary for common people, such as sliced noodles, sesame cakes, and fried dough sticks, have all been raised in price uniformly to maintain their capital. The general poor people are all complaining bitterly.</p>

<p>The Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce was ordered to raise funds for aircraft donation, with a target of 30,000 yuan. Merchants from various industries have separately raised more than 11,000 yuan, all of which have been sent to the province. The Second District Commissioner's Office, considering that the amount of donations raised in this county was still significantly insufficient, specially sent Zhang Zhongyu to Suzhou to supervise the collection. After arriving in Suzhou, Committee Member Zhang immediately consulted with County Magistrate Deng and Cheng Ganqing, Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, several times. In addition to having the Chamber of Commerce issue a letter urging various industries to quickly raise and submit the funds, on the 12th, Zhang Haishan and Xu Woyun, along with police officers dispatched by the police station, set off for Jingde Road, Guanqian Street, the East-West-Central Market, Yuyuxiang, and other places to solicit donations from each store that had not yet paid the donation, in order to gather the amount and remit it.</p>

<p>The Baohe Tang Traditional Chinese Medicine store on Tonghui Road near Huinong Bridge in our county, owned by Xu Baofa, caught fire unexpectedly last month, causing significant damage to neighboring properties. However, since Wu had fire insurance, there is suspicion of arson to claim insurance. Recently, Xu agreed to pay his neighbor Shao Er'er 50 yuan after receiving the insurance money and donate 100 yuan to the fire brigade. This matter came to the attention of Yu Zhuo'an, the town head of Huiqin Town, and Qiao Houfu, the head of the fifth bao, who reported it. Yesterday, they convened an emergency meeting of the baojia and decided to jointly petition the local court's prosecutor's office to investigate the matter according to law.</p>

Chairman Li Tiping reported that since the initiative was launched in our county, all sectors have enthusiastically supported it. As of the 10th, 15,183 yuan and 16 cents have been donated. The following matters were resolved: (1) Revised and approved the organization's constitution. (2) Encouraged all households that have not yet donated to contribute enthusiastically. (3) Decided to remit 10,000 yuan to the front lines first. The destination will be telegraphed to Commander Chiang's headquarters in Luoyang for instructions. Furthermore, the silk factory's labor union in our county purchased and manufactured 1,000 silk cotton vests to be sent to Suiyuan to comfort the soldiers.</p>

<p>Our county's chamber of commerce was previously ordered by the provincial government to raise 6,250 yuan for an aircraft donation to celebrate a birthday. However, the business in our county is too sluggish, and only 1,704 yuan has been raised, far short of the assigned amount. Yesterday, Zhang Buyu, a commissioner from the Second District Commissioner's Office, was dispatched to the county to oversee the collection. Our county's chamber of commerce remitted another 500 yuan. For the outstanding amount, Zhang ordered the chamber of commerce to clear the entire amount before the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>The four districts surrounding Yangzhou city have suffered from a severe autumn and winter drought. In areas where wheat was planted by laboriously drawing water, most of the seeds did not sprout. Those that did sprout are withering due to the lack of rain and snow. Farmers have been longing for rain for ages. Fortunately, light rain began on the evening of the 10th, turning heavier at 10:00 PM and continuing throughout the night. On the 11th, it rained intermittently, becoming heavy again in the evening. The total rainfall is estimated to be about three inches. The wheat seedlings that have sprouted can be expected to recover. However, it is difficult to predict whether the seeds that have not yet sprouted will be able to do so.</p>

<p>The Liangzhe Salt Transportation Office stated that the coastal counties of Zhejiang have historically been salt-producing areas. However, in recent years, salt production has not decreased, but tax revenue has declined. The reason is that illegally produced salt is rampant, which must be strictly investigated to increase tax revenue. In addition to instructing the salt affairs tax police to diligently investigate, the office also ordered the county magistrates to assist at any time and strictly prohibit illegal trafficking, illegal production, illegal transportation, and illegal sale.

However, some unscrupulous merchants are still privately transporting rice out of the area from time to time, causing prices to soar. To maintain the people's livelihood and balance grain prices, rice merchants are prohibited from transporting rice out of the area any further. Once discovered, the rice will be confiscated, and the merchant will be ordered to suspend business operations.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Li Daming Arrives in Shanghai After Inspecting Suiyuan; Talks About the Situation on the Front Lines <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>After the Suiyuan border situation became critical, overseas Chinese were extremely concerned. Chinese newspapers in the United States and Canada sent Li Daming to conduct a thorough inspection of the front lines in Hebei, Chahar, Shanxi, Suiyuan and other provinces, and to comfort the soldiers on the front lines. Li has already returned to Shanghai. It is said that since the recapture of Bailingmiao in northern Suiyuan, the bandits have lost their fighting spirit. Wang Ying was originally the son of Wang Tongchun, a major landlord in Hetao. Most of his troops were workers who had cultivated the land in those years, so the move to return to allegiance was natural. At present, bandit puppet troops are gathered in Shangdu. If they do not counterattack, the Suiyuan affair can be considered to have come to an end for a period of time. Song Zheyuan's attitude is very much watched by the whole country. Song is very chivalrous and has a very strong sense of national concept. All of his 29th Army are patriotic men of zeal and are filled with righteous indignation and have a good attitude. They are very submissive to the central government. Song's environment is special and difficult to deal with. However, since the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, although under threat, no treaties have been signed, etc.</p>

Yan, the general director of the Relief Committee, and Pang, the deputy general director, have already gone to implement the work and investigate the situation of the wounded soldiers and have now returned to Shanghai. It is expected that the war will break out soon, and we are deeply aware of the lack of medical supplies. The North China Branch of the Relief Committee of the General Headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society has been set up, and a relief team has been dispatched to enrich the treatment. According to letters and telegrams from the front, due to the severe weather in recent days, military hospitals urgently need bedding and medical supplies, which are the most important necessities. At present, there is not much in reserve. Therefore, we are publishing this notice to solicit these materials or funds for procurement. If you are willing to help, please send them to our society at 856 Xinzha Road, and we will issue an official receipt as proof.

<h3 id="e100">Tian Bo Lie Lectured Yesterday on International Situation and the League of Nations, Visited New Buildings in the City in the Morning, Then Visited President Cai's Illness, Scheduled to Return to England by Boat at 8:30 Tomorrow Morning <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Tian Bo Lie, President of the International Historical Society, accompanied by Kang Xuanyi and Jiang Jianbai, visited new buildings such as the Municipal Hospital, Library, and Museum in the city center yesterday morning. He then visited Mr. Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, and gave a public lecture at the YMCA at 4:30 PM. This afternoon, St. John's University held a tea party to entertain Mr. Tian. It is reported that Mr. Tian is scheduled to return to England by the Changxing Company's Asia Queen at 8:30 tomorrow morning. The following is an excerpt from Mr. Tian's speech at the YMCA yesterday. First, He Bingsong delivered an introductory speech. After the speech, Mr. Tian stood up and spoke on "The International Situation and the League of Nations." He first described the international trends after the European War, and then said the diplomatic relations between Britain and the international community, according to Balfour (League of Nations advisor in 1921) said that the emergence of the League of Nations, for diplomacy to resolve international disputes a new discovery. As a result, international diplomacy is divided into two new and old ways, but because we promote the new diplomacy too fast, before the new diplomacy has proved its value, we have given up the old law, now we are all in this difficulty in receiving efficiency. In the current Italian-Abyssinian incident, the judgments of 52 countries are ineffective. Although A'er still sends representatives in the League of Nations, it is impossible to say that it is an independent country. Both new and old diplomacy have tended to fail. We should combine the new and old diplomacy to build a new political system. Former British Foreign Secretary Canning said that public opinion and propaganda had a lot of power in the old diplomatic policy. After Canning's death, Palmerston succeeded as Foreign Secretary and adopted his policy, which made British diplomacy successful for more than 30 years. In 1864, he was defeated by Bismarck of Germany, and the new diplomatic policy was born in response to the facts. Empty words are no match for weapons, and morality is no match for force. England was humiliated by Prussia, just as the League of Nations was humiliated by Italy. England only recognized the independence of Belgium in the past, so Germany committed the territory of Belgium during the European War, but now Germany knows that England will protect Belgium and will never dare to invade it again. Article 4 of the International Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Locarno Treaty are all clauses expressing peaceful resolution of disputes. But how is the actual performance? Now I hope that there will be genuine legal control among nations. We are willing to transform the League of Nations and Article 4 of the League of Nations to further consolidate the territorial integrity of member states. It is ineffective if we invite aggressive countries to discuss everything together and transform it in this way. King Edward VIII of England said that we should sincerely support the League of Nations to resolve all disputes, but the lessons of the facts show that British diplomats will never adopt this. The League of Nations can still exist now, because there are still many countries behind the League of Nations that support the League of Nations, so the League of Nations is still an inviolable organization. Past lessons believe that it cannot be destroyed any more. The League of Nations is not dead and needs to continue to exist. The greater the lessons learned, the deeper the understanding of the international community. The past work of the League of Nations, such as public health, charitable organizations, and statistical surveys, are all beneficial undertakings for the world, and the International Court of Justice is also a pioneering initiative for the world to uphold justice. We are born in the political world and should engage in political activities and support political progress. China has always expressed faith in the League of Nations, and although past facts are not satisfactory, I hope it will not be distracted. We can represent unrealistic idealism with realism.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Suspension of Hunan Rice Transport to Guangdong, Suspension of Syndicated Loans <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the Yuehan Railway, the transport and sale of Hunan rice to Guangdong was carried out smoothly under the joint leadership of the Shanghai Syndicate, the Hunan Rice Merchants Association, and the provincial governments of Hunan and Guangdong. Recently, Hunan rice merchants took advantage of the large amount of sales rights to manipulate prices, which aroused the resentment of Guangdong distributors. As a result, rice prices fluctuated and citizens complained. In addition, the Yuehan Railway could not transport according to the stipulated time, and there were also cases of supply and demand not meeting. As a result, the transport of Hunan rice to Guangdong was suddenly suspended. China, Jiaotong, and other banks in this city had planned to use 10 million to 50 million yuan in funds to handle the syndicated loan for the transport and sale of national rice. It was decided that the transport of Hunan rice to Guangdong would be the first step. Now that the transport of Hunan rice to Guangdong has been suspended, the progress of the syndicate is facing many difficulties and has been temporarily suspended. Each bank will continue to handle it on its own. A reporter from Xinxin News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the suspension of Hunan rice transport to Guangdong should be rescued as soon as possible and restored as soon as possible. Otherwise, foreign rice will take the opportunity to invade, and the rice trade of more than 20 million yuan in Guangdong Province may still be plundered by foreign merchants. It is reported that the Bank of Communications has sent Li Zhongzhi to Hunan to investigate the truth and will meet with Yu Jichuan, Director of the Hunan Provincial Department of Construction, to discuss the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Contractor for Labor at the China Merchants Bureau's South Wharf Has Been Replaced by the Bureau Because of Insufficient Labor and Delay in Ship Schedules <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Bureau recently removed Li Huanxin, the contractor for labor at the South Wharf, for poor management and violation of the contract for labor. After repeated warnings, he remained indifferent. The contracting right of Li Huanxin was revoked, and Qiu Dinglai, the original alternate bidder, was assigned to take over the labor affairs of the South Wharf. A responsible person from the bureau issued a statement saying that the bid for labor at the South Wharf of the bureau was submitted on August 20 of this year, and the bids were opened on the same day. On August 24 of the same month, the bid review meeting reviewed the bids and selected Li Huanxin as the winning bidder, and Qiu Dinglai as the alternate winning bidder. The bureau ordered Li Huanxin to come to the bureau on September 2 of this year to sign the contract for contracting the labor at the South Wharf, and ordered the wharf management office to report that the contractor officially took over the labor and transportation affairs of the South Wharf on the morning of September 16 of this year. Afterwards, internal disputes occurred within the contractor, involving a large number of people. Although it had no direct relationship with the bureau's business, it could have been ignored. However, newspapers published notices one after another, which was not a good thing. The bureau is still investigating the truth of the case. However, since the contractor took over, he has been poorly managed, his measures have been flawed, and there is insufficient labor. Moreover, the bureau has repeatedly reported that there are cases of deducting wages, and the new laborers he uses are weak and inefficient, resulting in slow loading and unloading and delays in ship schedules. He has also made things difficult for customers, arbitrarily demanding money, and customers have made many complaints. According to reports, the contractor has also made things difficult for customs brokers. After reviewing the circumstances, it has violated the provisions of the contracting contract. The bureau has repeatedly ordered the wharf management office to give earnest warnings and limited the contractor to thoroughly improve the situation within a certain period of time, so that all bad measures can be eliminated and the schedules of each ship will not be delayed. Originally, it was hoped to give him a final opportunity to revitalize, but the contractor remained indifferent within the time limit and did not have any rectification measures. Moreover, within the time limit, the cargo transportation work of the Taishun ship could not be handled quickly, resulting in the ship's schedule being delayed as before. The bureau has repeatedly warned him, but he does not know how to repent. If it is not strictly rectified, how can we maintain business and value customer trust? Therefore, the bureau ordered the contractor Li Huanxin to have his contracting right revoked in accordance with the joint regulations, and ordered the original alternate bidder Qiu Dinglai to come to the bureau to pay the deposit and prepare a reliable shop guarantee to sign the contracting contract, and to take over the labor affairs of the South Wharf on a fixed date. The bureau also ordered the wharf management office to transfer the order to its subordinates, and to give the new contractor as much convenience as possible under the principle of increasing the efficiency of the bureau's business. Before the new contractor Qiu Dinglai takes over, the original contractor Li Huanxin is still ordered to be fully responsible for all labor work at the South Wharf. The bureau will hold the contractor accountable for any losses incurred. In order to take into account the interests of customers and the livelihood of workers, the bureau has also made additional regulations when signing the contract for contracting labor with the new contractor. The contractor shall not reduce the wages paid to workers after contracting compared with before September of this year (ie, before the implementation of the bidding), and shall not increase the additional labor force that customers are willing to pay compared with before September of this year, in order to achieve the purpose of eliminating malpractices such as deducting wages and extorting and making things difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Labor Service Propaganda Held in Gaohang Yesterday <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Shanghai Labor Service Committee convened a discussion meeting with representatives from all sectors of the Gaohang Township in Pudong at the Municipal Committee Office. The purpose was to discuss propaganda matters. More than 70 people attended, including the district director Pan Hongding, Donggou Police Chief Wang Chongshan, Gaohang District Farmers' Association Zhu Runsheng, Shen Baotian, and various school principals such as Ling Songjiao.</p>
<p>Chairman Hongding began with a report, stating that the purpose of Shanghai's ordered implementation of labor service is to enable everyone to serve the country, to develop construction projects, and to cultivate a habit of labor and a spirit of service. The projects undertaken by the district's labor service include dredging and protecting the Tanghe River, Henghang River, Zhuangshupu River, and Xiantangwan River, all of which are of great benefit to water conservancy and transportation. Now that service is about to begin, it is feared that some sectors are still unclear about the meaning and methods of labor service, and it is hoped that everyone will make efforts to publicize it.</p>
<p>Next, Yu Hui, a representative from the Labor Service Committee, reported on service methods and gave instructions on propaganda guidelines. It was decided that (1) starting immediately, all schools and Bao'an Tuan (local security corps) in the district would be fully mobilized to go to the villages for propaganda; (2) preparations would be made for a commencement ceremony, and meaningful entertainment would be included to encourage farmers' interest in service. The meeting then discussed various issues related to the engineering aspect and adjourned.</p>

<p>The Weitong Textile Factory workers' aid-Sui donation initiators, Wang Zhengping, Zhang Xilin, Jiang Minyu, etc., stated in a letter that "At this time of bandit invasion of Sui, and the critical moment of survival, we workers are also a part of the nation and naturally bear the important responsibility of saving the nation, and should also fulfill the obligation of rear support and comfort. Therefore, in addition to the one-day wage movement already conducted by the factory, we have specially joined forces with our comrades to initiate saving pocket money to慰勞慰勞 the soldiers on the front lines. Now we send the donations from colleagues in the machine repair section, totaling 44.08 yuan, to your newspaper office for transfer, and hope that workers in all factories will not shirk their responsibility and implement it uniformly."</p>

<p>At the beginning of the Suiyuan War, the owner of the Zhengtai Xinyi Rubber Factory in this port, realizing that the soldiers fighting bloody battles on the front lines were in urgent need of supplies, generously donated 2,000 pairs of the factory's famous "Huilipai" rubber shoes, and entrusted them to the Shen Bao for transfer to the Suiyuan Pacification Commissioner's Office in Sui Province. Yesterday, General Fu's letter of thanks and receipt were received. The value of these rubber shoes, just the shipping cost alone, has reached 216 yuan, totaling over 2,000 yuan. Now, all the employees of the factory have again donated 523.5 yuan from one day's wages and saved meal expenses (totaling 739.5 yuan including shipping costs), still entrusting it to the Shen Bao for transfer to the front. Furthermore, the factory had previously had a dispute with the Shiye Rubber Factory over the name "Wanli Shoes." It was reasonable to pursue compensation for the loss from the Shiye Factory, but the factory, considering the national crisis and the relationship between fellow businesses and intermediaries, could not bear to be harsh. Therefore, they requested the owner of the Shiye Factory to generously donate 200 yuan in national currency for the purpose of aiding Suiyuan. The patriotism and benevolent actions of the company are worthy of emulation.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Pudong Fellow Association Writes to Request Exemption of Housing Donation for Residents, Letter to Chuansha County <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Pudong Fellow Association sent a letter to the Chuansha County government to request exemption of housing donation for residents. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>According to letters from our members in Chuansha, Chen Caiqin, Wang Zhongming, Ding Zhengdong, etc., the Chuansha County government has recently sent personnel to collect housing donations from residents. The regulations and commencement dates were not announced in advance. When asked, the collectors stated that the funds were for expanding public security expenses, starting from July of this year, etc. Although public security expenses are important for maintaining local security, these expenses have traditionally been covered by surtaxes on land taxes, tea donations, and housing donations from shops. Chuansha is a small place with limited towns. Even if there is a need to expand public security facilities and increase the number of police officers, it can be covered by adjusting the existing donations and taxes. There is no need to add new taxes. Moreover, there was news of implementing housing donation in 1935, which was approved for postponement by various public organizations and fellow associations in the province. In April of this year, the Chuansha County government convened an administrative meeting, listing the collection of housing donation on the agenda, preparing to submit it for discussion. However, because of a deep understanding of the suffering of the people and the difficulty in bearing the burden, the county magistrate withdrew the proposal on the spot, indicating a postponement. Unexpectedly, only a few months later, personnel were dispatched to collect it, and it must be traced back to the beginning of July of this year, which is quite surprising. If it is done by the provincial government, then 61 counties of the province should be required to do it simultaneously. The investigation shows that the Shanghai and Nanhui counties adjacent to my Chuansha have not yet held it. Wujin then held it and then it was approved to be postponed, which is also seen in the newspapers. The areas of Shanghai, Nanhui, and Wujin are larger than Chuansha, and the security relationship is more important than that of Chuansha. How can Chuansha County alone open up the collection first, failing to enjoy its benefits? It is even more difficult to understand. As for the provisional measures for supervising local finance, provincial taxes should be planned by the provincial government, consulted by the Ministry of Finance for review and endorsement, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for resolution, and then submitted to the National Government for decree. County local taxes should be planned by the county government, convene local legal groups, open for discussion, submit to the Department of Finance for review and endorsement, and submit to the Provincial Government for resolution and decree, and consult with the Ministry of Finance for record. It is unknown to local Chuansha if the housing donation has gone through the procedures of the Legislative Yuan and the National Government. If it is a county local tax, then it has not gone through the procedures of convening local legal groups for public discussion, which is also not appropriate. Since the January 28th Incident, Chuansha has been affected by the general social depression. The countryside has collapsed and commerce has declined. Even those with some real estate have no income to look forward to. It is already difficult to maintain life, so how can they bear the burden of increased donations and taxes? This is the real situation that the members believe that housing donation cannot be collected.</p>
<p>All the people of Chuansha have the same opinion. In addition to submitting a separate letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Department of Finance, and Chuansha County Government to revoke the original plan and stop the collection, we hereby request you to convey the public opinion of the Chuansha people and request that the housing donation be exempted. Regarding the provincial housing donation, our association telegraphed the provincial government on March 20 of last year to request exemption. The situation reported by our members Chen Caiqin, etc., in their letter this time, that Chuansha should not be collected is also true. We hereby write to your county and request that you comply with public opinion and exempt the collection.</p>

<p>The mother of Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, passed away in Shanghai due to illness. Mr. Kong was deeply grieved by this sudden misfortune. Having arrived in Shanghai from Bianliang the day before yesterday, he immediately submitted his resignation to observe the mourning period. However, the Central Government, considering the Yellow River's winter flood prevention preparations and the importance of addressing the ice floe season, deemed it inappropriate for him to abruptly relinquish his responsibilities. He was granted a one-month leave to manage the funeral arrangements. Mr. Kong, along with his younger brothers, Xiangmian and Xiangxian, plans to escort his late mother's coffin back to their ancestral home in Qufu within a few days. A date will then be chosen for holding the memorial service and burial. In accordance with his late mother's will and the traditional rites of the Kong family, all funeral arrangements will be simplified as much as possible, given the current national crisis.</p>
<p>The late Madam Kong passed away at 12:00 noon on the 11th at her residence at 106 Avenue Grouchy in the French Concession, where the preliminary encoffining took place. The telegrams of condolence received that day from various parties included those from Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province; Shen Honglie, Mayor of Qingdao; Zhang Shaotang, Secretary-General of the Shandong Provincial Government; Zhang Honglie, Director of the Department of Reconstruction; Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Qingdao Municipal Government; Chu Zhen, Director of the Department of Social Affairs; Zhou Jiacan, Counselor; Guo Binghe, Director of the Bureau of Finance; Xu Sen, Section Chief; Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department; Lu Peizhang, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing; Li Tang, Director of the National Treasury Department; Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department; Tao Lujian, Vice Minister of the Interior; Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the National Economic Council; Zheng Zhaojing, Director of the Water Conservancy Department; Zhang Hanying, Deputy Director; Tang Kesan, Member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission; Lin Jiqing, Member of the Shandong Provincial Government; Song Xishang of the Nanjing Public Works Bureau; He Bingru, Standing Committee Member of the Shandong Journalists Association; Ling Changyan, President of the Pingjin Telegraphic News Agency; Zhao Qi, former Director-General of the Jiaozhou Commercial Port; and Kong Decheng, Sacrificial Official to the Sage Confucius. In total, over a hundred telegrams arrived in Shanghai. The elegiac couplets and plaques received included those from Xiong Xiling, former Prime Minister; Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance; Zhu Ziqiao, Chairman of the Relief Work Committee; Wang Yiting, Chairman of the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee; Fu Rulin, Central Committee Member and Chairman of the Yangtze River Conservancy Commission; Qu Yingguang, former Governor of Zhejiang Province; and Yu Hongqi, Member of the Control Yuan, among dozens of others. At noon on the 12th, the coffin was moved to the Chinese Funeral Home on Hart Road, and the major encoffining took place at 2:00 PM. Those from various circles who came to offer condolences included Xiong Xiling; Tan Zhonghui, representing Minister Kong; Tao Fuqing, representing Zhu Ziqiao; Guo Dehua, representing Qin Fen; as well as Qu Yingguang, Fu Rulin, Ye Zhuotang, Yang Jin, Zhang Du, Wang Lai, Li Wushen, Yin Tong, Zhao Lanping, Yang Zhixiong, Chen Jian'an, Chen Huahua, Chen Liting, Zheng Zhao, Hu Chunlin, Tang Zaijun, and Zhou Qibang, among over 500 people. Around 6:00 PM, Xiong Xiling, noting the late Madam's lifelong dedication to charitable causes and her role as one of the presidents of the World Red Swastika Society Women's Moral Society, led the presidents of the entire Shanghai branch of the World Red Swastika Society to the funeral home to pay their respects. It was said that the white carriages and horses on Hart Road displayed utmost solemnity.</p>

<p>Qin Jinqing, Manager of the Currency Joint Reserve Bank, after suffering from pleurisy and undergoing treatment by renowned physicians, is gradually recovering. However, the doctors advised him to rest due to overwork. Simultaneously, Fu Shenggui, Deputy Manager, was appointed as the Manager of Xinyu Money Exchange, making it impossible for him to concurrently hold both positions. Both submitted their resignations one after another. The Executive Committee of the Bank, noting that since its establishment on October 6, 1932, the currency reserves of the member exchanges had increased from three million yuan to over forty million yuan, establishing an exceptionally solid foundation and stabilizing the member exchanges, credited this achievement to Manager Qin. After repeated but unsuccessful attempts to retain him, his resignation was reluctantly approved. Chen Lishan was appointed to succeed him as Manager, scheduled to take office on New Year's Day. Mr. Chen was the former Manager of Baochang Money Exchange and a past Executive Committee member of the Guild. The position of Deputy Manager will be abolished, with Assistant Managers Qian Jingqiu and Yuan Wenyi continuing in their roles.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Shanghai West Silk Factory Workers Petitioned Party and Government Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Over five hundred workers from the Baohua, Yucun, and Yiyou silk weaving factories in Caojiadu, Yidingpan Road in this city, following the labor dispute that erupted on the evening of the 10th, remain in a stalemate due to the firm stances of both labor and management. Yesterday morning, six neighboring factories, including Yongfeng, briefly went on strike. The workers petitioned the Party and government authorities, as well as Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, and Wang Xiaolai for assistance. The Dagongshe reporter provides the following account of the situation:</p>
<p>Support from Various Factories</p>
<p>The Baohua, Yucun, and Yiyou silk weaving factories had previously dismissed workers without cause, leading to a dispute. Following an order from the Social Bureau, the dismissed workers were permitted to return to work. However, the factories refused to reinstate them, resulting in a strike. Yesterday marked the third day of the strike, which continues with relatively good order. Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, over a thousand workers from six factories near the three factories, including Yongfeng, Tiancheng, Fuxing, and Jingcheng, went on strike in support. However, the labor union sent representatives to dissuade them, and they resumed work as usual. Nevertheless, the workers' emotions are tense, and if the issue is not resolved, the strike may spread.</p>
<p>Workers' Petition</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the workers sent representatives, including Jin Xiuwen and twenty-three others, to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Social Bureau, the General Labor Union, as well as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, and Yu Qiaqing. Zhou Funong, Director of the People's Livelihood Section, received them at the Municipal Party Headquarters. Wang Xianqing of the Mediation Section received them at the Social Bureau. Zhou Xuexiang, a standing committee member, received them at the General Labor Union. Regarding the workers' requests, they promised to send representatives to mediate the matter immediately, urging the workers to await a resolution calmly and refrain from any excessive actions. Du, Wang, and Yu all comforted the workers, urging them to return to work and promising to persuade the factories to accept the government's orders. The workers expressed satisfaction and returned to the labor union to report around 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters' Statement</p>
<p>A responsible member of the Labor Movement Committee at the Municipal Party Headquarters stated to the Dagongshe reporter yesterday that while the workers were acting on orders to return to work, only to be rejected by the factories, their hasty strike was inappropriate. As for the factories' attitude, if they remain stubborn and refuse to accept the decisions of the Party and government authorities, they should also bear corresponding responsibility. Currently, the only point of contention is the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. If both labor and management show some flexibility, the labor dispute can be easily resolved. The Municipal Party Headquarters will strive to mediate a solution to prevent its escalation.</p>
<p>Mediation Fails</p>
<p>The Dagongshe reporter learned that management had attempted to enlist a prominent figure to mediate yesterday. However, after detailed discussions, management still refused to accept the workers' minimum demands: (1) Reinstating all dismissed workers in accordance with the Social Bureau's instructions; (2) Providing dismissed workers with three months' severance pay, calculated at one yuan per month. As a result, no agreement was reached. It is now reported that the Party and government authorities have decided to conduct further mediation in the hope of achieving an early resolution.</p>

<p>Female lawyer Shi Liang, along with Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, and others, were arrested late at night on July 22. The following day, the Third Branch of the Higher Court ordered her release on bail, requiring her defense lawyers, Tang Hao and Zhang Zhirang, to act as guarantors. After being released on bail, Shi immediately left Shanghai and has not reported to the authorities. Subsequently, the Prosecutor's Office of the Third Branch of the Higher Court, citing Shi's escape while on bail, issued a warrant for her arrest. Considering the responsibility of lawyers Tang and Zhang, they were ordered to appear before the Prosecutor's Office of the Special No. 2 Court. Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang convened a hearing, ordering Tang and Zhang to each post a cash bond of 500 yuan, with a ten-day deadline to produce Shi Liang. Tang and Zhang, along with Shi's family, published notices in the newspapers urging Shi Liang to report to the authorities immediately, as previously reported in this newspaper. As the ten-day deadline for Tang and Zhang was approaching, the Prosecutor's Office of the Special No. 2 Court summoned Tang Hao and Zhang Zhirang again yesterday morning. Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang, accompanied by a clerk, questioned them in the Second Criminal Court, asking whether Shi Liang had reported to the authorities today. Lawyer Zhang Zhirang replied that he and Lawyer Tang had telegraphed Lawyer Dong asking if he knew Shi Liang's whereabouts. Dong replied that he did not know where Shi was. The day before yesterday (the 10th), he received a letter from Shi Liang from 80 Guanqian Street, Suzhou, in her own handwriting. He submitted the letter, stating that according to Shi's letter, she had returned to her hometown to visit her grandmother after being released on bail and had intended to report to the authorities on time. However, she unexpectedly suffered from hemoptysis and was unable to report. She requested an extension of one week, at which time she would be able to report and await questioning. Chief Prosecutor Sun then stated that, both legally and morally, Shi Liang should report to the authorities as soon as possible and that it would be appropriate for her to surrender to the Higher Court in Suzhou. If she surrendered to this court, she would not be made to feel uncomfortable. Lawyers Zhang and Tang then expressed their intention to publish another notice, urging Shi Liang to report to the authorities as soon as possible. Chief Prosecutor Sun then announced a postponement to the 19th, for further review. Shi Liang should report to await questioning by that time. If she is truly ill and unable to move, the court can conduct an on-site interrogation in accordance with the law to clarify the situation. After the statement, the court adjourned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government, noting that the county's rice borer control efforts in 1935 were unsuccessful due to delayed preparations, has actively addressed the problem this year. From the 5th of this month to yesterday, district-level rice borer control campaigns and lectures were held.

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented the legal tender system, the exchange rate in this city has been stable, with each legal tender coin exchanging for 312 copper coins. Double copper coins exchange for forty-five or forty-six coins, and double hao coins exchange for fifty copper coins. However, yesterday at noon, there was a significant shortage of copper coins in this city, causing small money exchanges and cigarette vendors to display exchange rates of only 280 or 289 copper coins per legal tender coin. The exchange rate for double copper coins remained unchanged. The discrepancy in the exchange rate for copper coins increased by as much as 134 coins within a few hours.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Rong and Zhao, Facing Doors Opposite Each Other, Lawsuit Over Broken Chastity; Zhao Xing Sues Rong Erbao, Claiming She Was Violated and Happiness Sacrificed <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Rong Erbao, also known as Er Yang, a Wuxi native residing at 35 Shenyu Lane, Tiantong Road, whose father is the founder of the Sanxin Shipping Company, and Rong Shaoqing, the cook he employed, are being sued by Zhao Xing, a Liyang woman residing at 18 Ruiqing Lane, Dongjiaxing Road, for offenses against public morals. The indictment states that Zhao Xing's daughter, Zhao Genhua, now twenty years old, was employed as a servant at the Rongchang household at 41 Shenyu Lane, Tiantong Road. Rong Erbao, who lived in the lane in a house facing theirs, seeing that Zhao Genhua was young and attractive and that she was naive and easily deceived, colluded with his cook on September 11 of this year to lure Zhao to his home on the upper floor, where he forcibly raped her. Because she was weak and unable to resist, she was violated. Afterward, Rong Erbao falsely claimed that his wife was often ill after childbirth and that if anything happened to her, he would take Zhao as his successor, or at least as a concubine, never going back on his words. Zhao, being young and inexperienced, was seduced, and her chastity was broken. Subsequently, on the 17th of the same month and on October 3, she was lured to his house and raped twice more. Zhao Xing believes that her daughter, who has not yet been betrothed, has been violated without cause, and her happiness for the rest of her life has been sacrificed. Rong Erbao, the first defendant, committed the egregious acts of luring and raping Zhao Genhua, violating Articles 229 and 241 of the Criminal Code. Rong Shaoqing, the second defendant, is guilty of violating Article 240, Section 2 of the same code. Therefore, the plaintiff brings this suit, requesting punishment. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Xiao Xie-Fen presided over the Second Criminal Court and summoned the two defendants, who were not present. Lawyer Mao Fengwu appeared in court as their representative. Judge Xiao, after briefly questioning the plaintiff, Zhao Xing, and Zhao Genhua, adjourned the case for further hearing on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Ye Fu-kang Embezzlement Case; Judge Cross-Examines Witnesses; Hu Jin-kun Details Events; Ye Fu-kang Denies Reconciliation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Ye Fu-kang, a lawyer who formerly served as a judge in the Shanghai District Court and now runs a hat shop selling "Little Luzon" hats, was accused by Wang Hanqing, a Henan native who formerly worked as a detective in Hankou, of embezzling his vast fortune under the guise of defending him in a theft case in 1931. The Ministry of Justice ordered the District Court to investigate. Prosecutor Tang Ru-xiu released Ye Fu-kang on a cash bail of 20,000 yuan and indicted him for embezzlement. Yesterday morning, Judge Lu Hong-shi presided over a continued hearing in the Fourth Criminal Court. Ye Fu-kang was defended by lawyer Yu Chengxiu. The judge questioned witness Hu Jin-kun, 39 years old, a Hubei native who formerly lived in the Nanshan pier in Pudong and now resides at 23 Yongxing Lane, Tangshan Road, Xiahaimiao. He stated that he did not know Ye Fu-kang, but Wang Hanqing was his friend. Wang was arrested for theft in March 1931 and initially hired lawyer Fan Gang, who was recommended by Li Zhanyuan, for a fee of 3,000 yuan. Wang Hanqing's wife, Wang Zhangshi, and his brother Wang Fuyou's wife, Wang Yangshi, went to the police station to visit him but were also detained, and two banknotes worth 2,000 and 5,000 yuan, as well as sixteen gold ornaments, were confiscated. He did not know who hired Ye Fu-kang. Wang Hanqing was released in April. After Wang's release, he did not meet with him. The two women were released first. They had a total of 10,000 yuan deposited in Juxingcheng Bank. He withdrew 4,000 yuan, gave 200 yuan to Wang Yangshi, and deposited the remaining 3,800 yuan in Zhejiang Xingye Bank, including a 3,000 yuan fixed deposit and an 800 yuan current account. He gave the 800 yuan in the current account to Wang Yangshi. The banknotes were given to Li Zhanyuan. He was not present when they were given to Ye Fu-kang by Wang Yangshi and Wang Zhangshi. Questioned about Ye Fu-kang's claim that the banknotes were in his possession and that he refused to hand them over, resulting in the publishing of a notice declaring them invalid, he replied that this was not true. He did not know how much was paid to Fan Gang. When asked if Wang Hanqing had gone to Shanghai in 1933 to ask Ye for money, he replied yes, he returned 5,000, but he did not know who handled the process. In 1935, he received 500 yuan at lawyer Gu Ao's office. When asked about Gu Ao's saying 1300 yuan, he stated, "I do not know how much they secretly transferred." Wang came again this year. Because Wang Zhangshi had died and his daughter, Cui Bao, was getting married, he was going back. When asked whether there had been a reconciliation, he replied that Ye Fu-kang had taken a 20,000 yuan bail receipt and asked lawyer Gu Ao to tell Wang to settle the matter for 10,000 yuan. Wang said that the money was not in his hand and that he wanted to vent his anger in court. He and Wang had stayed at 11 Central Apartments, Pushi Road, for one night, and Gu Ao had also come to discuss reconciliation. Furthermore, Cao San-ye called Gu Ji-rong's law office on October 23 to discuss reconciliation, but it was unsuccessful. The document submitted by Wang Hanqing was not a withdrawal of the charges but a statement that the money had been taken by a woman. Gu Ji-rong drafted the document, and Gu said that it did not matter and that the lawsuit could still be pursued. Gu Ji-rong was recommended by Li Song-tang. Asked why, if there was no reconciliation and he did not receive any money, he would admit wrongdoing, he replied that he did not know the inside story. Asked whether Wang Hanqing had seen the document, he replied that Wang Hanqing was illiterate and that Gu Ji-rong read it to him. The judge then stated that if Ye Fu-kang was innocent, then Wang Hanqing had made several inconsistent statements and should be charged with false accusation. Furthermore, his previous statements were inconsistent. If he wanted to make a statement, why didn't he do so in court, instead of making a statement admitting false accusations? This was very strange. Do you know his place of origin? He replied that it was Laiyang County, Henan, but he did not know the detailed address. The judge ordered an investigation to locate him and bring him to court. Hu Jin-kun repeatedly agreed. The judge then questioned witness Li Song-tang, 44 years old, a Shaoxing native who works as a ticket inspector for the Shanghai Tram Company and resides at 327 Huishan Road. He stated that he did not know Wang Hanqing, but was introduced to him by a friend, Li Yingxiang, who lived at his place. Li has now returned home due to unemployment and is not in Shanghai. He has forgotten whether Wang Hanqing hired Gu Ji-rong to draft the document on October 8 or 9. Because Wang Hanqing was anxious to go home, he wanted to draft a document. There was no fee, only a document fee of 2.4 yuan. Gu Ji-rong wrote the draft in pencil. He did not understand what they were talking about or what they were writing. Two or three days after the document was submitted, Wang Hanqing left without saying goodbye and never returned. At this point, the judge summoned Ye Fu-kang to court and questioned him about the witnesses' testimonies, asking if there had been any reconciliation. Ye replied that there had been none at all. The judge then stated that he would adjourn the case to investigate further and summon Wang Hanqing for further questioning.</p>

<p>Gambling on the Huangpu River in Hongkou has long been rampant, with three gambling dens operating on Changjiang passenger ships docked at the wharves of the Dongyang Company, Ewo Company, and Taikoo Company. The Dongyang Company wharf is the original den, while Ewo and Taikoo are newer. (Recently, due to strict police raids and shallow waters on the Yangtze River, few ships are available, so only the Dongyang Company operates, hiring barges or dockside vessels and mooring them in the middle of the Huangpu River to gather people for gambling. The games offered include Tongbao, Yaotun, and Twenty-One Points, and they employ numerous accomplices to serve as lookouts at key locations on land and water. If they spot police boats approaching, they signal, and the gamblers quickly row the boat to the wharf and scatter to escape, making arrests difficult.) Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, the gamblers hired a boat and moored in the middle of the Huangpu River in Hongkou for gambling. Detectives from the Water Police Station discovered this and immediately led officers on a patrol boat at full speed to make arrests. The gamblers spotted them and immediately rowed the barge close to the Dongyang Company wharf to disembark and escape, but the detectives had already surrounded them from behind. The operator, Wu A-kang (a Ningbo native), was arrested, but the others escaped. Wu and the gambling equipment were taken to the Water Police Station. After questioning by the station chief, Wu A-kang and the gambling equipment were transferred to the District Court yesterday. After a brief interrogation by the prosecutor, he was ordered to be detained pending prosecution.</p>

<p>The Xiaonanmen branch of the Nanqu Citizen Association of this city has completed all procedures since its preparation.

<h3 id="e134">Fire Insurance Claim Reward Payments Are Being Processed for Completion <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After the January 28th Incident, the residents of Zhabei suffered a great disaster. Some of those who had fire insurance were promoted by Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Binyan, Tang Youwei, Ye Jiaxing, and others to organize the Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claim Association to negotiate with various insurance companies based on reason. However, because it involved war, the insurance companies were unable to bear the responsibility for compensation. After several months of effort, little progress was made. Therefore, the policyholder meeting publicly elected Hu Yibo, Xu Zaikang, Wang Zhixiang, Mu Yueqiu, Ma Rugen, and others to form a claims committee to intensify the claims work. Soon, due to financial exhaustion, it was suspended halfway for almost half a year. The committee members Wang Zhixiang, Xu Zaikang, Mu Yueqiu, Ma Rugen, Liang Baolin, and others, deeply concerned about the interruption of the association's work and the unfinished mission, re-invited enthusiastic committee members to continue planning and received financial support from the sponsors of the association, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Songyuan, Ye Jiaxing, Mo Meiqing and other committee members, thus enabling the re-energized claims work from Jiaotong Road in Zhabei to take off. At that time, society sympathized, public opinion supported, and the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau mediated. Yu Juntianbi was especially diligent in his efforts. Therefore, in less than a month, 19 Hua Shang Insurance companies jointly provided 10,000 yuan as an initiative for relief. More than 150 foreign insurance companies were mediated by Ye Weiyi of the Social Affairs Bureau. After years of effort, they received a similar 20,000 yuan for relief. The funds were held in trust by the Social Affairs Bureau. After two policyholders' meetings in January of the Republic of China year 24, they resolved the distribution method. The re-elected claims committee members and policyholders who participated in the claims were entitled to rewards and bonuses. It was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau, and payments were made in batches as recorded. Now it is heard that the rewards for the claims committee members have been largely completed, but the bonuses for the policyholders have been outstanding for three years due to numerous relocations. The person in charge of distributing the funds, in order to expedite the completion, has published notices in Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers on the 4th, 5th, and 6th of this month to register and urge collection. For the registration procedure, one only needs to state the name, address, and the number of times they participated in the claims at Jiaotong Road and mail it to Shen Bao mailbox number 391 before the 15th of this month.</p>

<p>The Qin Feng Cotton Weaving Factory at 450 Saposai Road in the French Concession was opened by Gu Yiqin from Wuxi for many years with a capital of hundreds of thousands of gold. Previously, it was engaged in weaving silk products. Recently, due to the sluggish market, it switched to operating cotton textiles. In April of this year, after moving to a new location at 162 Rue du Pere Froc, the old site was converted into a warehouse to store raw materials such as cotton. More than a dozen flower-picking female workers worked there every day. At 10 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's warehouse. The female workers noticed it and rushed out to inform the accounting room to report to the fire brigade. The fire engine immediately rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It had already spread to the neighboring Jiu Yi Hosiery Factory. After an hour of firefighting, the fire was extinguished. At that time, the French police station heard the alarm and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene to suppress the situation. Afterwards, the police station learned that the Qin Feng Factory warehouse had several thousand gold in fire insurance, while the Jiu Yi Hosiery Factory had moved its machinery and materials to the new factory on Yuezhou Road and Feihong Road in Hongkou three or four days ago. Therefore, the loss of the old factory yesterday was only several thousand gold. The police station is currently investigating the cause of the fire to determine the appropriate action.</p>

<p>Xiang Qizhang from Anhui recently set up a private opium den at 61 Pu'ai Fang, Zhoujiapai Road, for people to smoke opium for profit. Liu Wenzao, a Chinese detective chief from the Yangshupu police station, found out. At 1:50 PM the day before yesterday, he collaborated with Chinese and Western detectives to go to the address and arrest Xiang, along with opium addicts Ye Hongbao, Li Guisheng, Yang Xiaoba, Yao Dalong, and others, as well as opium paraphernalia, and took them all to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated the circumstances. Then, Chief Detective Liu reported the details of the raid and presented the evidence for inspection. When questioning the defendants, their statements were evasive. Judge Zhong Qing sentenced Xiang Qizhang to two years and six months in prison, Ye Hongbao, Li Guisheng, and Yang Xiaoba each to seven months, and Yao Dalong to six months. Before serving their sentences, they were sent to the anti-addiction hospital for a one-month detoxification treatment. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

<p>Xie Juxiu, 32 years old from Tongzhou, is currently a rickshaw puller. He currently lives at 2 Qingyun Li, Baoxing Road, Zhabei. His elderly mother, Xie Chen, 60 years old, and wife, Xie Lanying, 31 years old, live at 194 Chenjiabo, Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Unexpectedly, Xie, although a rickshaw puller, also learned the habits of urban youth, squandering and neglecting the lives of his mother and wife, and never returning home for four years. Although Xie Lanying had little schooling, a poor woman without education, she was quite virtuous. She worked in a factory every day, earning her hard-earned money to support her mother-in-law. Therefore, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law did not feel cold and hungry because of the bad son's absence. But heaven did not bless them. Recently, Xie Lanying overworked herself and became ill, causing the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law to have no food to cook. She had no choice but to discuss life with her son, but was met with violence. Therefore, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law were heartbroken and filed a complaint with the district court. Yesterday, Judge Xie held a hearing. The defendant did not appear. The old woman recounted the experience and said that when the son was eight years old, his father died. She endured hardship to raise him and arranged for Lanying to be a child bride. When he was 20 years old, she arranged for them to marry. Now he has abandoned his mother and wife for four years because my daughter-in-law is sick and cannot work. When I advised him, he became violent. Xie Lanying testified that she usually made 70 to 80 cents a day, which was enough to support herself, but now she is really sick and her husband is ungrateful and beats her. The official said, "Your mother, son, and wife cannot resolve the lawsuit. You are loving and helpful, which is very good, and your son's work and husband are also pitiful. You should go back and reconcile properly. The defendant will be summoned next time to resolve the matter." Then he adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Laozha police station learned that Shen Jinbao, nicknamed "Qiao Pigu Jinbao" (翹屁股金寶, "翘屁股" literally means "翹 butt", a common local nickname), and others specialized in opening rooms in major hotels within their jurisdiction to gather people for gambling and skim profits. Therefore, they intensified their investigation. However, the places where Shen and others gambled were like rabbits with many hideouts, and they frequently changed their location, making it difficult to arrest them. The day before yesterday, they learned that they were in room 503 of the Xinxin Hotel and were about to go to arrest them, but Shen and others moved to room 240 of the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road and continued to gamble. Yun A'gen, the Chinese Chief Detective of the police station, ordered detectives at 11 PM the day before yesterday to rush to arrest them without making a sound. At that time, the gambling was in full swing. The detectives rushed in and arrested the bosses Shen Jinbao, Li Jinbao, Chen Zhulin, and gamblers Shen Xiaobao, Zhou Heqin, Wu Hangye, Li A'gou, Lin Zirong, Chen Jiuxia, Gu A'you, Zhang Heshang, and others, a total of 29 people. They confiscated gambling paraphernalia such as pai gow and mahjong tiles, and more than one hundred dollars in gambling money, and took them all to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court. Judge Ye Shengchao interrogated them. Qian Jiujiu, the police station's lawyer, prosecuted them for gathering to gamble and gambling and requested severe punishment. After questioning by Judge Ye, Li Jinbao was sentenced to two months in prison, Shen Jinbao and Chen Zhulin each to one month in prison, and the rest were each fined ten yuan as a warning. The gambling paraphernalia and gambling money were confiscated.</p>

His family resides at 25 Ningkang Li, Route Ghisi, French Concession. Ma's third son, Ma Mingxia, 28 years old, also works at the Xinwei Relief Association.

<p>Zhu Sanmao from Ningbo, at 8:30 PM on May 28th of this year, colluded with accomplices to rob Madame Rong Chen with weapons on Yuezhou Road, stealing gold jewelry worth 60 dollars and fleeing in different directions. The police station was notified and captured him. Recently, Liu Zhaonian, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou police station, and detectives Chen Baozhong and Wang Chonghao investigated and captured Zhu Sanmao, a bandit in this case. He confessed that his accomplice was named Xiao Liansheng, and Ni was his laotouzi (老師頭子, meaning "teacher," referring to his leader). The detectives then went to arrest Ni Yucai and took him to the First Special District Court. Zhu Sanmao's confession was the same as before, stating that Ni provided the gun, but Ni Yucai denied it. He was remanded and the investigation was postponed. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the continued hearing. Zhu Sanmao suddenly changed his testimony, saying that he had falsely accused Ni because he had failed to borrow money from Ni. He asked for leniency. Judge Zhong sentenced Zhu Sanmao to three years and eight months in prison and released Ni Yucai. The case was closed and the remaining ten dollars were taken away by Xiao Liansheng.</p>
<h3 id="e143">35 Packages of Morphine Seized in Cao Hang Town; Special Commissioner's Office Secretly Dispatches Officers to Seize Ding Boqi and Ding Zhangshi and Bring Them to Justice <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>At 6 AM on the 12th, six plainclothes detectives, along with the police chief and police officers from the Cao Hang Town Public Security Substation, suddenly arrived at the home of Ding Boqi in Cao Hang Town, a county-administered town. They guarded the front and back doors and searched the house for 40 minutes. As a result, 35 packages of morphine (each package worth five yuan) were found hidden in the grass behind the house. Ding Boqi and another suspect, Zhangshi, as well as the seized goods, were taken to the car parked on the Hu-Min Road and driven away to be handed over to the authorities. It is learned that these plainclothes officers were dispatched by the Songjiang Special Commissioner's Office because the office received a confirmed secret report that Ding Boqi was engaged in the business of selling drugs and had a large amount of drugs at home. Therefore, officers were dispatched to search the house. Ding Boqi is a merchant in the town and owns a cotton ginning factory. No one can confirm whether he usually engages in drug trafficking.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Deposit Dispute at Dong Xin Hotel; Ren A'gen Dies by Suicide as a Result <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Dong Xin Hotel in Baoyu Li, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, was originally opened by Wang Derong. In May of this year, Wang Qingchu and Bian Jing'an jointly leased it for business. It was still operated under the original brand name with the addition of a "Yuji" (裕記) character. It was transferred and sublet to Xu Yusheng before its term was up. It received a security deposit of more than 2,800 yuan. The more than 1,400 yuan deposit paid by the waiters, Chen Dachang, Zuo Liyan, and others, was completely ignored. They could not get it back from those who owed it. Later, lawyer Gu Kenfu mediated and Wang Qingchu wrote a receipt promising to return the deposit to the waiters. When the deadline arrived, the waiters asked Gu for the money, but he was unable to pay. The waiters negotiated with Gu, and it even escalated into violence, but the money was still not received. Now, the waiters Chen Dachang and Zuo Liyan and ten others have hired a lawyer to file a fraud and injury case against Wang Qingchu and Gu Kenfu with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. After one hearing, the case was rescheduled because the defendant did not appear. However, one of the waiters, Ren A'gen from Ningbo, committed suicide by taking poison because he could not recover his deposit. After it was discovered, he was sent to the hospital for treatment and recovered, but he still died due to the remaining poison. Yesterday, Judge Sun Penghai interrogated the case. The plaintiffs and their lawyers appeared in court and testified that the deposit was paid in front of Gu Kenfu and collected by Wang Qingchu, who issued a receipt. The receipt was presented as evidence. Only Gu Kenfu appeared as a defendant. Wang Qingchu sent a lawyer to appear on his behalf. According to Gu, when they paid the deposit, I and Wang Qingchu had not yet met. Three or four days after I met Tu Qingchu, the plaintiffs surrounded Wang Qingchu and demanded money at the Qinghe Hotel. Wang asked me to mediate. I wrote a receipt with a scheduled date. When the date arrived, Wang had no money to give me, so I had no money to pay the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs then went to my house and argued all night. After reporting to the police station, they dispersed. Later, Wang Qingchu gave me a check for 130 yuan and 60 to 70 yuan in cash, totaling 200 yuan, and asked me to go to the Dafang Hotel to reconcile with the plaintiffs. Because the plaintiffs did not want the check and needed cash, the reconciliation failed. He denied any joint fraud or injury. Wang Qingchu's defense lawyer stated that Wang could not appear in court due to illness and presented an account book to prove that he had paid the plaintiffs some money and wages and there was no fraud. The court examined the situation and, due to the lack of witnesses, ordered a rescheduling for the 19th for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The first University League Football Championship, which began last week, saw Jinan taking the lead with two wins in two games. Fudan had also defeated Guanghua. Although there was still one game against Tongji, the odds of winning were stable. Therefore, the Fudan and Jinan teams have become evenly matched in the competition. The two teams met in Zhenru yesterday, and the key to success or failure was highly contested. The battle was tense and fierce throughout. However, Fudan lacked footwork, so it was overwhelmed by Jinan with a score of six to two.</p>
<p>After the exchange, Jinan attacked first. After about fifteen minutes of stalemate, Fudan's left forward, Fang Baoling, received support from the left and registered the first goal. However, one minute later, Jinan launched a fierce attack again. Right forward Liang Yaohua broke out of the crowd and shot low, hitting the target. The score was tied at one to one. Ten minutes later, Jinan's center forward, Wu Shufang, scored another goal, exceeding the score to two to one. The first half ended with this score. After Jinan took the lead, Jinan became more and more courageous and the offensive became more intense. Fudan had been too defensive in the first half, leading to the backwardness, so it changed to an offensive strategy. Unexpectedly, the defense was slightly relaxed, so Jinan took advantage of the opportunity to enter. Jie Yaohua scored first in five minutes, increasing the score to three to one. Soon Xue Yongyuan also shot in the free throw line, and the situation was even more superior with four to one. Then Cai Jincai got the ball from the left wing and touched it into the net, making it five to one. Fudan also counterattacked fiercely at this time. Fang Baoling and Liu Zuxiu were the most active, but they failed to get the desired result due to lack of response. Before long, Fudan's hinterland was once again trapped by Jinan. Wu Shufen passed in from the sideline, and the landing point was excellent. Cai Jincai touched the ground and hit the crossbar again, and the posture was wonderful, which was rare. Jinan led with six to one, and the championship was stable. Liang Yaohua also withdrew due to injury, and Zhang Minzhi replaced him. Fudan's forwards did not give up despite the fact that hope was gone, and still fought back hard. Ten minutes from the end of the game, Li Changchi passed in from the sideline, passing over the goal. Liu Zuxiu caught up and picked it up, bouncing from the top of the crossbar. The battle ended with a score of six to two. Jinan won the first University League Championship with three wins in three games, inheriting the greatness of the Jiangda era. Referee Chen Jixiang.</p>

<p>The 11th Football and Basketball Championship of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Sports Federation ended successfully yesterday. The two champions and runners-up have also been produced one after another. St. John's was miserably eliminated from the football championship and Jinling successfully defended their title. St. John's was also two points behind in basketball and Hujiang won the award. Now, except for Soochow University, which will embark on an expedition to Hangzhou today, other schools such as Yancheng, Taowu, Jinlu, and Zhijiang will also return separately today. The specific situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Football Championship</p>
<p>The football championship final was held at 11:00 AM yesterday. Although St. John's had the advantage of location, it was finally eliminated by the defending champion Jinling team due to the difference in strength. The Jinlu team members were all unusually tall, which gave them a lot of advantages. The sharpness of the attack and the proficiency of the contact did not diminish the power of the previous champion. However, St. John's also tried their best to defend, making it impossible for Jinlu to progress. Neither side gained anything in the first half. After the break, St. John's tried to make progress, and the defense was slightly relaxed, causing Jinling to take advantage of the opportunity to enter and lose as many as three goals, and was eliminated. Jinling successfully defended their title. The loser replay of Mingqiang against Hujiang was held at the same time. Hujiang was very strong at the beginning, leading by one to zero, but unexpectedly was eliminated by Mingqiang with three to one in the end. St. John's and Mingqiang teams still had the courage to sell and held the runner-up final at 3:15 PM. St. John's was stronger and won with two to one, winning the runner-up. There was still a friendly football match on the St. John's Stadium, which was the Soochow University team against the St. John's University team. As a result, St. John's shot one goal in each half, winning with two to zero. The lineup of each team was the same as the previous day. The results of each game are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Mingqiang beats Qinjiang (loser match) three to two (first half) 0 to 1</p>
<p>(2) Jinling beats St. John's (Championship) three to zero (first half 0 to 0)</p>
<p>(3) St. John's beats Mingqiang (Runner-up match) two to one (first half one to zero)</p>
<p>(4) St. John's University beats Soochow University (Friendly match) two to zero (first half one to zero)</p>
<p>Basketball Championship</p>
<p>The basketball championship is a single-round robin league. Six schools participated. As a result of the fierce battle, St. John's and Hujiang were tied with four wins in four games. St. John's and Hujiang met in yesterday's competition. The outcome was crucial to the ranking. Both sides had cheerleaders to support them. After the start, both sides were obviously flustered and the throws failed to work. After three minutes of stalemate, Shen Ji'en opened the record with a free throw. St. John's got one point first, and Hujiang's Tang Baojia's basket hit the target, exceeding it with two to one. St. John's hit two points to surpass them. Before long, Hujiang's forwards suddenly became sharp, throwing and penalizing quickly, adding up to ten to three in one breath. St. John's suspended, and the situation improved. Liu, Shen, and Zhou scored successively, tying the score at twelve to twelve. Since then, each other has gained something, and Hujiang is leading by one point. When St. John's Liu Zude's long shot hit the target, it fell into the basket and the break time arrived. Eighteen to seventeen, St. John's led the first half by one point. After the second battle, St. John's had two leads of twenty-two to twenty-one and twenty-eight to twenty-six, but with a little negligence, Tang Baojia attacked the basket continuously and added twelve points in one breath, creating a disparate score of forty to twenty-eight. St. John's chased hard, until thirty-eight to forty, the time was running out, and the whistle rang suddenly. Hujiang then won the championship with these most valuable two points with five wins in five games. St. John's finished as runner-up. Yesterday there was also a game between Soochow and Zhijiang. Because the order was switched, both sides did not know, so there was no competition, but it was not related to the ranking and was cancelled.</p>

<p>The Secretariat of the Shanghai Basketball Association announces that this year's games will be conducted according to the new 1936-37 rules. Currently, the official rulebooks have not yet arrived in Shanghai. We have only received a notice from the American Referees Association outlining the major changes. This notice has been translated and published for the benefit of members. Fortunately, the changes are simple and easy to remember.</p>
<p>(1) A large circle with a radius of six and a half feet is added outside the center circle of the court. During the jump ball, other players may not enter the circle before the jumper touches the ball.</p>
<p>(2) Each team is allowed to call four "time-outs" during each game (previously three under the old rules).</p>
<p>(3) The restriction on offensive players in the free-throw area within the semicircle farthest from their own basket for three seconds is removed. That is, the effective area of the 3-second rule is reduced.</p>
<p>(4) The rule that "substitute players may not speak with players on the court before the start of the game" is removed.</p>
<p>(5) If a defender touches the hand of a player holding the ball with one or both hands, it will not be considered a "hitting" personal foul.</p>
<p>All new and old members should promptly complete the membership and registration procedures at this office. (Old members should pay a registration fee and security deposit of 5 national currency units each and obtain a registration form from this office. B-group teams should also submit a photo of each player.) New members must pay a membership fee of 10 national currency units in addition to the above procedures. Those who have not completed the procedures clearly will not be allowed to participate in the games. Please pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Today, there are two First Division Western Union football matches. Kiangnan and the French Business Association will re-encounter each other in the second round.

In the first half, Sanmin's momentum was strong, but Huanan's forwards cooperated well and passed quickly, creating opportunities. At 15 minutes, Huanan's center-back kicked a free kick from over 40 yards away. The ball flew straight into the goal. Sanmin's goalkeeper waved his hand to deflect it, but Huanan's right inside forward added a touch, sending it into the net. About 4-5 minutes later, Huanan was awarded a 12-yard free kick, which was scored, bringing the score back to equal. However, Huanan quickly attacked again, with the right winger passing to the center forward, who shot directly into the goal. In the second half, Sanmin's morale was slightly dampened, and Huanan's right inside forward scored another goal, making the score 4 to 1 in favor of Huanan.</p>

<p>First Half</p>
<p>St. Francis attacked first. After 8 minutes of stalemate, Donghua got a penalty opportunity. Sun Jinshun scored the penalty, opening the scoring. After that, although Donghua's attack was strong, they were unlucky and missed several chances. Soon after, St. Francis's right-back, Shi Dengge, committed a foul, and another penalty was awarded. Luo Haiguang took the kick but missed. Because Su Shi moved on his own when Luo raised his foot, a retake was awarded. Luo Haiguang took the second kick, but it was still blocked by Su Shi. Soon after, Luo shot from the 15-yard mark, but the shot was weak and was caught. The first half ended with Donghua leading 1-0.</p>
<p>Second Half</p>
<p>After lemonade, St. Francis gradually became active. After 15 minutes, Joni Ho shot from the sideline, Zhang Rongcai caught it but then lost it, Huilai rushed up and kicked it into the net, making it equal. The morale was boosted. Zhang Rongcai, with both hands and feet, saved two critical shots. After 20 minutes, Jia Youliang dribbled forward and passed to Wu Naho on the left baseline, who shot forcefully into the goal, putting Donghua ahead 2-1. Three minutes later, Jia Youliang and Wu Naho established contact, with the left and right wings assisting forward, rushing to the end. Both Jia and Wu were knocked to the ground. The ball bounced off Jia's leg and into the net, making it 3-1, securing Donghua's victory. Donghua won the game with a final score of 3-1. Yesterday's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai</p>

<h3 id="e174">Guangdong's Measures for Students Studying Abroad: Twelve Students Selected to Study in Europe and America This Year <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong Province held the third selection examination for publicly funded students to study abroad in June of this year, selecting twelve students to study in Europe and the United States, majoring in hydraulic engineering, hydroelectric engineering, mechanical engineering, military chemistry, ordnance manufacturing, shipbuilding, metallurgy, rayon, woolen agriculture, and education. The province provides the following benefits for students studying abroad: for those studying in Europe, 1,000 yuan for overseas travel and outfitting expenses, and the school fees will be paid in full. Each student will receive a monthly living allowance of 14 British pounds and 40 British pounds for return travel expenses. For those studying in the United States, 1,000 yuan for overseas travel and outfitting expenses will be given, and the school fees will be paid in full. Each student will receive a monthly living allowance of 75 US dollars and 300 US dollars for return travel expenses. This is the current situation for those studying abroad. Upon completion of their studies and return to the country, the provincial government will assign them to work in government agencies or factories. If publicly funded students engage in non-assigned jobs without government permission after graduation, they will be required to repay part or all of the public funds they received. Their salaries during their service period will be limited to 100 to 1000 yuan. Those who have served in government agencies, schools, or factories will be able to advance in their original salary scale when they return to serve, and the length of service will be the same as the length of the public funding. As for the measures for counties and cities to subsidize students studying abroad, each county and city must meet three conditions: (1) The county or city's approved education funds are not in arrears; (2) The county or city's compulsory education funds have been fully allocated in accordance with the province's interim measures for the implementation of compulsory education, with no delays; (3) The field of study of the students subsidized by the county or city is indeed particularly needed by the local county or city. The application must be submitted to the Department of Education for approval before subsidies can be granted. The fields of study subsidized for students should be limited to science, engineering, agriculture, medicine, and education. The students subsidized by each county and city should be recommended by the county to participate in the Department of Education's selection examination for publicly funded students studying abroad. After passing the examination and being approved by the Department, the county may issue subsidies. However, if the country and subject applied for are suitable for the provincial quota and public funding is provided by the province, the county subsidy will no longer be received. The subsidies allocated by each county and city to students studying abroad should not exceed 10% of the total county's educational funds.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Ministry of Education Orders All Middle Schools to Follow Teaching Hours <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments of all provinces and cities on the 11th, stating: "The table of teaching subjects and weekly teaching hours for each subject in junior and senior middle schools has been revised and promulgated by the Ministry in February of this year, and a circular has been issued stating that it will be implemented from the 25th academic year. Subsequently, the curriculum standards for each subject in junior and senior middle schools were revised and fully promulgated before June and a circular was issued ordering their implementation. In this academic year, all first and second grade students in junior and senior middle schools in all regions should follow the revised curriculum standards, and third grade students should follow the previously promulgated curriculum standards for teaching separately. There should be no changes or additions to the teaching subjects and hours. However, it has been found that many middle schools in various regions have not been able to strictly comply, and some have arbitrarily increased subjects and hours in preparation for the joint entrance examination and higher education, with the daily increase in hours exceeding the regulations by one or two hours. This will leave students with no free time to participate in extracurricular activities to improve their physical fitness, and no adequate rest time to recover from their fatigue, which will have a significant impact on the development of young people's physical and mental well-being. We hereby issue a circular to all departments, instructing all middle schools under their jurisdiction to pay close attention to rectification. Provincial supervisors should pay special attention to this during inspections, and severely correct any violations in order to comply with the law and emphasize efficiency. It is also hoped that all middle schools under their jurisdiction will be instructed to strictly comply. This is of utmost importance." In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance.</p>

<h3 id="e186">Little Friends, Let's Promote the "One Cent Movement" <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Bai</p>
<p>Thanks to the bravery of our front-line soldiers and the enthusiastic support of people across the country, the war in Suiyuan has achieved great victories. The recapture of Bailingmiao last week was the most glorious event of defeating the bandits and recovering lost territory.</p>
<p>Little friends! Aren't you happy and excited to hear this news of victory? However, at this moment, while we celebrate our victory, we must not forget our responsibility to love our country. We must know that this invasion of Suiyuan by the puppet bandits will not end completely with one defeat. They are preparing for a second and third large-scale invasion! Therefore, our support work in the rear should be redoubled and we should do our best!</p>
<p>Now people across the country have enthusiastically risen to engage in various support activities for Suiyuan, such as the "One-Day Movement," "One-Dollar Movement," "Reducing Food," and "Stopping Coal" heroic movements. But here, I want to propose a "One-Cent Movement" to children across the country. I hope that each of us children will donate one cent to contribute to the country, support Suiyuan, and fulfill our smallest responsibility to save the country!</p>
<p>I think this suggestion will definitely be echoed by children across the country, because although we are all young children and our power to save the country is the smallest, we all have a patriotic heart that everyone should have. Children with money can save a cent from candy and toys, and poor children can also save a cent from clothes and food. Send this money to the newspaper office or bank, etc., and remit it to the soldiers who are fighting hard on the front line. This is an easy task, but if tens of millions of children across the country can do it, then there will immediately be several million dollars to contribute to the warriors who are fighting bandits and killing thieves.</p>
<p>Little friends across the country! I hope you all discuss and work hard to promote this "One-Cent Movement"!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Idle Talk about Suiyuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>This invasion of Suiyuan by bandits has made the people of the country immediately pay attention to Suiyuan, and the support movement for Suiyuan is expanding daily. However, we believe that many people still do not clearly understand everything about Suiyuan. Therefore, I want to briefly introduce the evolution, transportation, products, and customs of Suiyuan here, so that children can also leave a deep impression in their minds.</p>
<p>Evolution: Suiyuan was designated as a special region in the third year of the Republic of China (1914), and it was not until the seventeenth year of the Republic of China (1928) that the special region was changed to a province, with Gui Sui as the provincial capital. Currently, it has four first-class counties: Gui Sui, Salachi, Baotou, and Fengzhen; four second-class counties: Wuchuan, Xinghe, Wuyuan, and Jining; and eight third-class counties: Tokto, Dongsheng, Liangcheng, Qingshuihe, Helin'er, Taolin, Guyang, and Linhe.</p>
<p>Transportation: Suiyuan's land transportation includes the Ping Sui Railway, which starts from Beiping, passes through Chahar and Shanxi, and ends at Baotou County in Suiyuan, with a length of about 750 kilometers, also known as the Ping Bao Railway. The future plan for this railway is to connect to the Long Hai Railway to the south and the Ping Han Railway and Jin Pei Railway to the southeast, forming a large circle. As for its functions, it is very convenient for national defense and has the hope of development in culture and commerce. As for highways, there are the Sui Zhang Road, Sui Meng Road, Xi Sui Road, Ning Bao Road, and Bao Dong Road, which are five major trunk lines with a total length of 1,400 kilometers, all of which are now open to traffic. In addition, there are 40 branch lines, with a length of 3,800 kilometers, of which one-third have not yet been built.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products: Suiyuan has fertile land and abundant agricultural products. Except for rice, which is not produced, wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, millet, glutinous millet, oats, buckwheat, soybeans, green beans, peas, mung beans, and soybeans are all produced, and the quantity is also considerable. In addition, the area already planted or not yet planted but suitable for forests is more than 100 million mu.</p>
<p>Animal Husbandry: According to the estimates of the Central Agricultural and Industrial Institute in the twenty-second year of the Republic of China (1933), Suiyuan Province mainly has 275,000 head of cattle, 93,000 horses, 37,000 mules, 61,000 donkeys, 3,297,000 sheep, with an average of more than 15 head per household, 1,704,000 pigs, with an average of 9 head per household, 2,181,000 chickens, with an average of more than 12 head per household, and 80,000 ducks, with an average of 0.2 head per household.</p>
<p>Customs: Although there are still many Mongol residents in Suiyuan, there are also many Han people who have migrated from Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, and other places, especially Shanxi people. There have been immigrants from Shanxi in Suiyuan for one or two hundred years, and the number of people is large, so the customs and human feelings are not very different from Shanxi. Marriages between men and women are still based on the orders of parents and the words of matchmakers, with very little autonomy. When people die, the rich use extremely luxurious clothes, coffins, and burn ghost money, and chanting sutras by monks is also unavoidable. Wealthy families are very lively when they raise sons, celebrate the full moon, and celebrate the hundredth day.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Parasitism <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>One Sunday morning, not long after Min'er got up, he felt pain in his stomach, so he sat listlessly in a chair in a daze.</p>
<p>"What are you sitting here for? Are you feeling unwell?" his brother Cong'er asked him.</p>
<p>"I don't know why my stomach hurts so much today," he said, and went to defecate.</p>
<p>After a while, Min'er quickly ran out and said to his brother, "It's really strange, I don't know how I excreted a lot of worms, but my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. Brother, what are those worms?"</p>
<p>"That must be roundworms."</p>
<p>"What roundworms?"</p>
<p>"A roundworm is a parasitic animal. It often parasitizes in the intestines of the human body. At first glance, it is similar to an earthworm, but if you look closely, it has no segments on its body, so we call it a round animal. Its color is yellowish-white or slightly reddish, and both ends are thinner. The abdomen, back, and both sides each have straight lines. The one on the back is called the dorsal line, the one on the abdomen is called the ventral line, and the ones on the sides are called the lateral lines. This is the approximate shape of its appearance. But parasitic animals have general properties: (1) They parasitize in the bodies of all animals and absorb ready-made nutrients, so their digestive organs are very simple. And roundworms don't even have stomachs. (2) Their reproduction is particularly developed, and the reproductive power of roundworms is very alarming. It has been calculated that roundworms can produce 15,000 eggs in one day and night. (3) They parasitize in animal bodies, so their sense of feeling is very weak, because they are not needed. (4) Their heads have hooks or suckers, which can fix their position."</p>
<p>"Then what is the relationship between roundworms and us?"</p>
<p>"Parasitic animals mostly parasitize in the intestines of the human body, absorbing blood and nutrients. If the impact is small, it is stomach pain; if the impact is large, it will cause lack of blood in the body, headaches, muscle pain, loss of appetite, mental abnormalities, and other diseases, and even death. The impact of roundworms is relatively small. But there are always disadvantages."</p>
<p>"Then how do we prevent it?"</p>
<p>"They enter our body mostly directly. For example, the eggs of roundworms are excreted from the body with the feces of the animals they parasitize. If they are left in water or on vegetables, people will drink water or eat uncooked vegetables, so its eggs enter the body and develop in the intestines. So next time you eat something, you must be especially careful and never eat uncooked things."</p>

<p>Ancient China, about to sink, watching the Central Plains being divided. Little friends, truly ambitious, determined to be little soldiers; small wooden guns, carried on their backs, small wooden horses, mounted below, practicing steps, learning war. Little brother ×××, young, single-mindedly wants to be a Boy Scout; no uniform, no scarf, having fun playing games; piling stones, making fortresses, folding grass, as flags, everyone learns from Yuwen Shen; parents smiled, saying "My son is really attentive, China's future has hope, the Chinese nation can be revived."</p>
<p>Note: Yuwen Shen was a general in the Northern Zhou Dynasty. As a child, he folded grass into flags and piled stones into fortresses, arranging formations that were quite in line with military tactics.</p>
<h3 id="e191">The Simplest Gas Mask <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Since the development of science, war has become even more terrible than before. Today's war is completely chemical warfare, and the most terrible of these is the release of poisonous gas. We should know that once a war breaks out, regardless of the front or the rear, the enemy can send a large number of bombers to attack our major cities or important resource areas, and release various poisonous gases to kill the people in the rear, restrain the soldiers fighting on the front, and give a major mental blow to the people in the non-toxic areas. Therefore, we must deeply study the knowledge of gas protection and how to implement protection methods. Here, I will introduce to you a simple method for making a gas mask. Little friends! Hurry up and make one to play with!</p>
<p>Method: Prepare a tin cigarette can. Punch two small holes on the edge of the lid for tying the rope. Then drill a number of small holes in the bottom of the can. Then go to the pharmacy to buy sodium carbonate and sodium thiosulfate, a certain amount of each. Mix them evenly with clean water, the thicker the better. Add a little glycerin to mix them. Soak the cotton wool in it. Put the soaked cotton wool into the finished can. The outside of the can must be covered with gauze soaked in this solution. In this way, it can be tied to the face to cover the mouth and nose, and become a simple gas mask.</p>
<p>There are also two simpler methods of gas protection, which are to soak the daily-used towel in clean water and cover the mouth and nose to breathe, which can prevent relatively light poisonous gas, and to wet the towel with soapy water, or use one's own urine in an emergency to cover the mouth and nose. This is what we can do very easily temporarily.</p>
<p>Little friends! Our gas mask is made, but we should know how dangerous we are! At any time and anywhere, the enemy can come to attack and use the most cruel means, so we have to prepare early, and gas masks are very expensive to buy. How can our poor common people afford them? Therefore, I hope that 200 million little friends across the country will quickly go to the poor rural areas to promote the gas mask here, which anyone can make. I think you will all be happy to take on the task!</p>

<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Christmas and New Year's Day in the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) are coming soon, so Santa Claus, who has been resting for a year, has to become active again. White beards and red clothes can be seen everywhere in the market, and the big package on his back is usually full of colorful toys, ready to be given to those happy little friends.</p>
<p>But, little friends, this is a time of serious national crisis. The borders of Suiyuan are being invaded by bandits, and enemy planes are constantly flying to drop bombs and bombard. The soldiers in the National Army are swallowing ice and chewing snow, fighting bloody battles, and Qingdao, a piece of pure land, has been trampled on by iron hooves. May I ask, under such circumstances, do the little friends still have the mood to play with toys?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I followed my father to Sincere Company to buy things. When I walked to the fifth floor, I saw many workers busy decorating the scenery. The paintings on it were all ice and snow. I was curious and went in for a walk. According to a staff member there and my father, they did this because they realized that the national crisis was serious and that national defense significance must be instilled into the minds of the little friends, so they made new patterns and made a conscious embellishment, using Bailingmiao, which was recently recovered by the National Army, as the background, depicting the heroic deeds of patriotic soldiers on the front line who killed the enemy and achieved success, so that the little friends, once they arrived here, would feel as if they were on the scene and aroused patriotic enthusiasm. Such official propaganda toys are indeed worth emulating by other merchants.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it was still being arranged that day and had not been completed. After they are completely finished, I must go with a few little friends to visit. Although we cannot go to the front line of Suiyuan in person, there is still much to see here.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Shark (Part 1) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Xun</p>
<p>Q: Is a shark a type of fish? A: Yes, a shark is a cartilaginous fish, belonging to the squalus genus of the horizontal-mouthed class. Therefore, sharks are also known as squalus. Q: What is a cartilaginous fish? A: Of the more than 16,000 species of angular fish on Earth, they can be divided into two orders. One is the bony order. All fish belonging to the bony order have hard bones. The other is the cartilaginous order. They are the opposite of the bony order and are all cartilaginous. In addition, their caudal fins are irregular, with the upper lobe larger than the lower lobe. The body is covered with shield-shaped scales. The outside of the gills does not have a gill cover. The inside of the body does not have an air bladder. These are all unique features of cartilaginous fish.</p>
<p>Q: Then what is a "horizontal-mouthed class"? A: The horizontal-mouthed class is a type of cartilaginous fish. All fish belonging to this class have large and horizontally split mouths that grow on the abdomen. The nostrils grow at the lower end of the snout. There are five pairs of gill holes, but there are also six or seven pairs. Their juveniles are either viviparous or oviparous. Q: How big can the largest shark be? A: Among sharks, the long-tailed shark is the longest, at 15.6 feet long. The hammerhead shark is about 10 feet long. The rat shark is about 10 feet long. The cat shark is 3.4 feet long. The white shark, blue shark, and horn shark are all about 2.3 feet long. Q: Please tell us about the morphology of these sharks in general. A: Okay, now I will start talking, please listen carefully!</p>
<p>(1) Long-tailed shark: Its head is very short, the end of the mouth is round, the dorsal fin is very high, the pectoral fins are also very wide, and the length of the caudal fin is equal to the length of the trunk.</p>
<p>(2) Hammerhead shark: This shark is also known as the mallet shark, because its head grows protruding left and right, deforming into the shape of a double mallet, and also looks like the head of a mallet used to strike a bell in a temple, which is very beautiful.</p>
<p>(3) Rat shark: Its body is also very long, and the shape of its head is sharp like a rat, and its tail fin is very large. (4) Cat shark: The body of the cat shark is much smaller than that of the rat shark, which is exactly the opposite of the size of real cats and mice on land. At the same time, because its head shape and markings resemble a tiger, it is also called the "tiger shark." Its head is shaped like a hammer, and the end of the snout is blunt and round. The color on the back of the body is light brown and slightly red, with many dark brown and light brown horizontal stripes, like the markings of a tiger. The fins of this shark are very large, and there is a powerful hard spine at the front of each of the two dorsal fins.</p>

<p>— Hai</p>
<p>While travelling along the Volga River, the boat was being hauled by several horses on the shore. Suddenly, a very strong windstorm swept through. To keep the boat from crashing into the bank, the boatmen used a thick oar and accidentally knocked Perskovya and two other passengers into the river. Fortunately, they were soon rescued. However, due to a secret part of her body, Perskovya was reluctant to expose herself in public. The wet clothes, sticking to her body, further damaged her health. A friend trusted by Mrs. Milin separated from her in Novgorod. She continued alone, neither giving her a letter of introduction nor indicating the way forward, leaving her groping in the dark. Fortunately, the kind Mrs. Milin generously helped her, making her purse and luggage more full than when she first left Igish Village. The boatmen put her ashore at a pier under a bridge foot. She saw a chapel on a high ground ahead. As usual, she went there to pray before looking for a place to stay. The chapel was empty, but she heard the voices of many women behind a row of wooden grilles, praying. It turned out that this was a nunnery, and the voices of these women immediately gave her new encouragement and comfort. She thought, "If God can accept my prayer, I would also like to hide my face behind the veil like them, because I am very afraid of going to a hostel and being treated rudely." Having nothing to do at the moment, she began to pray again. A nun came and told her that it was time for the monastery to close. Please go out quickly. Perskovya immediately said to her that because she was unwilling to go to a hostel, could she be allowed to stay here for one night. The nun replied that they never received foreign travelers, but that their abbess might be able to help her. Perskovya opened her purse and showed it to the nun, explaining that she had received help from charitable friends in Ekaterinburg, and that she no longer needed any money, but only asked for a night's lodging. The nun was very happy with her generous attitude and took her to see the abbess. Her frank and moving story, coupled with the proof of her passport and the letter of introduction from Mrs. Milin, immediately made the gentle abbess excited and happy. She very diligently let her sleep in her own bedroom, and seeing the injuries she had suffered when she fell into the Volga River a few days ago, she decided to keep her for a few more days to recuperate.</p>
<p>After Perskovya had lived for a few days, she fell ill. Her illness was very serious, and the doctors said that her life had reached a very dangerous point. But although she felt that her illness was not improving, she was not disappointed. She said to herself, "I do not believe that my end has come, I hope God will allow me to complete my work." Sure enough, after a short time, she gradually recovered, although the recovery was very slow, lasting through the long summer. She was finally able to continue her journey. But her body after the illness was very weak and could not withstand the shaking of the post car, so she had to wait in the nunnery for a snow car to set off.</p>

<h3 id="e197">Cotton Yarn: Spun Yarn Fell for Three Consecutive Days; Although Real Sales are Sluggish and Qingdao Factory Resumes Work, The Market is Too High and Rebound is Inevitable <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the decline is severe. Due to sluggish real sales, the Qingdao Yarn Factory is scheduled to formally resume work on the 14th. Customers believe that the end of the year is approaching and there should be procedures for settling accounts, so yarn sales are even more sluggish. People's hearts are softening. In fact, the current yarn price has reached a high level. If there is a slight unfavorable news, the wind will be even more intense.</p>
<p>Distant-Month Spun Yarn Declines Further</p>
<p>The spun yarn market opened weakly in the morning. When it came to distant-month futures, the decline suddenly began. Due to sluggish yarn sales, the Osaka Sanpin yarn market declined slightly. The Qingdao Yarn Factory officially resumed work on the 14th. There was a lack of buyers in the market. After the second session, the market price opened and declined. In fact, the previous day's rise was too激烈. The current environment is slightly unfavorable, and the rebound is more intense. The resulting months of spun yarn all fell by 1.3 to 3.7 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The noon session saw the December futures hold steady due to the China Cotton Company's absorption without releasing, but distant-month futures were sluggish due to particularly sluggish yarn sales. The resulting month fell by 1 yuan and 10 cents compared to the morning closing price, and quickly fell by 5.6 cents. It was found that Hengyi sold 7,000 bales, Dafu 2,200 bales, Hexing 4,050 bales, Xingchang 2,850 bales, Senkang 1,150 bales, Yuan 2,300 bales, Xincheng 2,200 bales, Mingde 2,600 bales, Shenji 5,000 bales, Dachangcheng 5,150 bales, and Tonghe 1,000 bales.

<p>The cotton market rose for two consecutive days, but today it rebounded and fell. This is because US cotton fell by more than ten pounds, Indian cotton rose and fell, and the yarn market entered a sluggish situation again. People's hearts are even more frustrated, but some bulls remain calm. The current cotton mill demand is still quite strong.</p>
<p>Decline in Cotton Futures Leads to Short Covering</p>
<p>The flower market opened in the morning because US cotton had risen for two consecutive days and then rebounded slightly, falling by more than ten pounds. Indian cotton rose and fell, and the Osaka Sanpin flower market also declined slightly. At the same time, the yarn market was not good, and the momentum was even more frustrated. The short sellers were active, and the market gradually declined. However, the large buyers did not relax the amount of absorption. The resulting months of cotton futures all fell by 4 to 6.5 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon session saw the morning's decline become even more severe, leading to floating accounts covering their shorts. Each month rose by 2.3 cents. After the second session, it was flat. The resulting month rose by 5 points compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Yuanxingchang sold 8,100 dan, Dafu 1,600 dan, Chengji 3,000 dan, Hengyi 2,500 dan, Dafeng 8,800 dan, Daji 2,600 dan, Juxing 11,200 dan, Gengfeng 1,200 dan, Yichang 5,300 dan, Kang 8,500 dan, Minghua 2,100 dan, and Xinchang 2,400 dan.

<h3 id="e199">Many Bull Closings in American Cotton <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with increases of two to four points for each month. Trading was slow, and there was a reactionary trend in the market. The amount of bull closings and hedging sales by cotton farmers were absorbed by the industry. The May contract met significant resistance at 12.255 cents. Spot cotton is slow but firm, and the cloth market is firm. This week’s sales have been below production levels. At the close, there were bull closings, and market prices weakened, with spot prices down ten points and futures down eight to thirteen points in general. British spot cotton rose five points, and futures fell one point. Indian cotton initially firmed due to purchases by futures traders and exporters, but then retreated due to hedging sales. Bengal cotton rose by 0.50 to fall by 0.25 rupees, Oomra rose or fell by 0.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 0.75 rupees, according to a telegraphic report (dated the 11th).</p>

<h3 id="e201">Piece Goods - Rapid Advance, Quick Retreat - Cotton Cloth Market Sentiment Turns Sour - Everyone Scrambles to Sell, Dull Sales, Dye Factories and Grey Goods Alike Reduce Orders <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market conditions continued to weaken, and with yarn prices declining rapidly, everyone was scrambling to sell, resulting in dull actual sales. Sales orders for grey goods such as Japanese fine drills and fine cloths fell even more sharply, declining another 1 to 1.50 dimes per piece compared to the previous day. Heavy cloths also fell by 1 dime. Fine cloths, fine drills, and heavyweight drills from local mills also retreated by 5 fen to 1.50 dimes. Only goods in short supply, such as those from the Ewo mill and heavyweight and lightweight drills from underwear factories, were able to maintain their original asking prices, and daily shipments from factories were sold out. With the season coming to an end, production of flannelette, printed flannelette, and corduroy is gradually decreasing, and current sales are still good, and prices are still stable. Printed goods, broadcloth, and serge are also stable in the market, as various factories have no inventories. Various dyed goods continued to sell well. Only the Hokkien trading houses had good demand for grey fine cloths and fine drills, and dye factories, which are the most significant buyers, are reducing their orders for grey goods in response to the daily price declines and mediocre dyed cloth sales, only buying what is urgently needed. However, even the delivery of bills of lading with contracted delivery dates from Japanese factories are being delayed, reportedly because Japanese trading companies are selling existing inventory to other ports. Therefore, although market prices have fallen, actual inventory remains meager. However, shipments from Qingdao are expected to increase daily from next week.</p>

<p>Recently, new shipments of woolen fabrics have been arriving in port successively, so there were many declarations of imports last week. However, regarding tariffs, such as for woolens exceeding twelve ounces per square yard, ad valorem taxes are assessed. Some firms, in an effort to reduce tariffs, have underreported quantities, while others have overvalued goods, leading to frequent disputes. It is reported that several dozen cases of thick woolens from two foreign firms have been detained due to disagreements over valuation and have not yet been resolved. It is found that current market wholesale prices for thick woolens, such as those from the Baoda and Baodali brands, have fallen from 1.60 to 1.70 yuan to 0.80 yuan.</p>

<p>Before the promotion of the new subsidiary currency, the exchange rate between copper coins and silver dimes would invariably narrow every year as the Winter Solstice approached. Although the influence of the old subsidiary currency this year is not as strong as before, it has already been observed as of yesterday.</p>
<p>The black market rate for copper coins is surprisingly high, reaching a premium of 11,500 cash per 100 yuan. It is reported that small money shops in the Hongkou district of this city are purchasing and shipping to Qingdao.</p>

<p>The gold market suddenly fell yesterday but retreated slightly. However, large speculators aggressively absorbed the decline, so even though sellers were also eager, they could not cause a significant change. It was found that early in the morning, overseas silver markets were flat in both England and America. The forward silver price in Montreaux rose by 0.07 to 0.095 yuan. Exchange rates declined slightly, and the price of spot gold in London fell by 3 pence. The Central Bank's posted rate was announced, flat in both England and America. The customs gold unit declined by 0.04 yuan, and the standard gold price fell to 1153 yuan. Transactions outside the market required a deposit of about 5 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong sold. The morning opening was slightly lower. After the opening, the demand from large speculators varied. However, because both sides mostly limited their positions, the overall trend was extremely flat. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's posted rate was announced, flat in both England and America, and the silver equalization tax was unchanged. It hovered around 55 yuan. Both sides struggled repeatedly. Although demand from actual users increased later, large speculators absorbed as much as possible at the low, making it difficult to decline further. Therefore, the morning market only fluctuated by 0.20 yuan. The half-day market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 1155 yuan, down 0.20 yuan from the previous close. Yuan Mao Yong and Tong Tai Chang supplied, retreating to within 5 yuan. But Sheng Yuan Yong Qing Fa Yong slightly increased to 5.10 yuan. Wan Xing Hong Lai sold, falling to 4.90 yuan. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's posted rate was announced, flat and stable in both England and America. Cheng Da Heng Yu maintained at the low. The silver equalization tax was announced unchanged. At this point, it hovered around 5 yuan. Tong Tai Chang Chun Yuan, Yong Yuan Mao Yong Lai sold, falling again to 4.90 yuan. Da Chang Xiang worked hard to maintain it. The noon close was at 1154.90 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price was announced with the Central Bank's standard gold price down to 115 yuan, about 2 yuan higher than the closing price. The January account was 1155 yuan, and the morning margin call was 1153 yuan. The spot market was stable. Tianjin goods were quoted at an additional 13.20 yuan. Refined gold was offered at 15 yuan and bid at 11 yuan, with little trading.</p>
<p>Trading inside the market was still flat. In summary, Cheng Da, Qia Feng, Yong Da, Chang Xiang, Sheng Yuan, Yong Qing Fa Yong, etc., were on the buying side. Chun Yuan Yong, Tong Tai Chang, Da Feng Heng Shen, Da Yong Yu Xing Yuan Mao, and Yong were on the selling side.</p>
<p>It was found that the half-day market was extremely stable. The morning opening was 1155 yuan, the highest was 5.10 yuan, and the lowest and noon close was 4.90 yuan, a fluctuation of 0.10 yuan, resulting in a decline of 0.30 yuan from the previous close. The total number of transactions for the half-day was 504.</p>
<p>The January contract lineup: On the long side, Da Chang Xiang had over 1100, Qing Fa Yong and Yuan Mao Yong had over 800 each, Wu Chang Xiang had over 400, Li Feng had over 200, and Fu Tai Heng Yi Sheng Yong Heng Fu Da Fu Xing had over 100 each. Da De Cheng had over 800, Cheng Da had over 700, and Jing Fu had over 500. Da Feng Heng had over 200. Shun Mao Qian Chang Xiang Chang Yu Tong Tai Chang had over 200 each.

<p>The foreign exchange market remained stable yesterday. Banks and Japanese banks slightly oversold. Chinese merchants took the initiative. Early in the morning, overseas telegrams reported that London large cable transfers were flat for both near and far dates. The New York silver market was unchanged. The forward silver price in Montreaux rose by 0.07 to 0.095 yuan. The price of spot gold in London fell by 3 pence. The British pound fell against the US dollar by 0.0125. The British pound was unchanged against the French franc. The US dollar fell against the British pound by 0.0125. The US dollar fell against the French franc by 0.025. The Central Bank's posted rate was announced, flat in both England and America. The customs gold unit fell by 0.04 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 and 5625/10000 pence, and US exchange at 29.75 yuan, flat from the previous close in both British and American exchange. After the opening, banks supplied more than they sold. Japanese banks also dumped East exchange. However, because of intermediate offsetting, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's British and American rates, as well as the silver equalization tax, were flat and had no impact. Although banks continued to supply later, the purchases by Chinese merchants had no impact. By the close, the near-term selling price of British exchange was 1 shilling, 1 and 5625/10000 pence, and US exchange was 29.75 yuan, flat from the previous close in both British and American exchange. The forward dates were also the same. Chinese merchants slightly bought shillings. The details of British and American exchange transactions are omitted due to the abundance of material.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public bond market in the securities market continued to rise, and market sentiment was also extremely stable. Although the situation is still depressing, large speculators continue to show strong buying appetite, and many small investors are also buying in. Market prices rose across the board on the thriving platform. However, large short speculators also sold aggressively, so in the later market, it gradually turned back down. Because the long and short sides are still deadlocked, it presented a swirling trend. The trend was quite bullish at the opening yesterday morning. Large speculators such as Nos. 35, 4, and 5 were very active in buying. Nos. 50 and 54 were mostly releasing and short-selling. Market prices rose across the board by 0.20 to 0.45 yuan. Market conditions remained strong in the second round. Nos. 20, 11, and 77 became even more active in buying, while No. 25 turned to selling. Nos. 47, 41, and 3 continued to sell off. Categories B and C continued to rise by 0.10 to 0.35 yuan. Category A of the current month fell slightly by 0.05 yuan. At the afternoon opening, the market turned weak. Nos. 4 and 11 continued to buy a lot, and Nos. 35 and 5 sold a lot. Except for Category C of the current month, which was still good at 0.10 yuan, the rest fell back by 0.05 to 0.30 yuan. At the close, Nos. 15 and 54 continued to sell off or release in large quantities, and the market continued to be weak, declining another 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. However, No. 4 bought a lot of each bond in the current month. As a result of the full day, all rose by 0.05 to 0.35 yuan. The total number of transactions was 7.22 million yuan. The comparison of their gains, losses, highs, and lows is listed in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

Oil mills bought 4,000 bags of Tancheng beans, 400 bags of Huaian beans, 351 bags of Anqing beans, and 700 bags of Bengbu beans. Local inland cart shops bought over 1,700 bags of Sipingjie beans, over 200 bags of Xiashi beans, over 100 bags of Wuhu beans, 116 bags of Zha beans. The Xiamen gang bought 100 bags of sand yellow. The Ningbo all procured over 200 bags of Ying beans. Prices rose again by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. The rise in sesame prices is alarming. The asking price for clean goods from foreign firms has already reached 14.30 to 14.40 yuan, but there is no supply at the moment. Although no transactions have occurred, it is secretly believed that new high prices will appear. Sales of spot raw sesame to the Dongyang gang and Shaoxing gang in this street were quite good. Prices rose more than 0.10 yuan compared to the previous market, with over 900 bags of each type of sesame being traded.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Over 36,000 piculs of Rice Arrive in Nanshi - Over 10,000 piculs Sold North - Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Fall 0.30 Yuan <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, due to the arrival of all the ships that had been delayed from various origins, there was a sudden surge in supply, totaling 180 shops with 36,450 piculs of goods. Thin rice still accounted for the majority, totaling around 100 shops, which instantly lowered market sentiment. Sales in this street turned sluggish, and although package users from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Henan, etc., continued to purchase 8,000 to 9,000 bags of thin rice and 1,400 to 1,500 bags of thick japonica rice, the sudden surge in arrivals caused supply to exceed demand, leaving over half of the rice unsold. This frustrated sellers' intentions to sell, causing them to lower prices to try to sell out. As a result, the situation immediately weakened, the market fell sharply, and customer groups insisted even more on lower prices. Consequently, the price of thin rice fell sharply by 0.30 yuan, while the price of thick japonica rice, fortunately with less supply, fell slightly by 0.05 yuan. Arrivals and sales of Du Yang tip rice were balanced. Yin Yuan was short of supply and tight.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, over 50 shops arrived from various routes downstream of the river. Sales of various goods in the market were normal. Conditions were stable in the morning market. In the afternoon, it was heard that package users had temporarily suspended purchases, causing market prices to weaken. White japonica rice prices in the afternoon market were slightly lower, close to 0.10 yuan. The prices of high-quality thin rice were slightly lower by more than 0.10 yuan, and medium-quality was slightly lower by more than 0.20 yuan. Early rice was also slightly lower by more than 0.10 yuan. The prices of Yang Du Bu tip rice were flat and weak. Customer tip rice sales were normal, and prices were peaceful. White Yuan wine users were active, and retail was also active, with prices increasing by more than 0.10 yuan. The prices of other goods were generally weak.</p>
<p>(Customer Xiang Rice) Yesterday, arrivals and sales of customer Xiang rice were both strong, with each exceeding 10,000 bags. Sales of Hunan rice to Guangdong could not be implemented. Reduced taxes on foreign rice shipped to Guangdong were expected. Vendors from Quanzhou and Henan in this street were actively purchasing. The market ended up flat and soft. Daily sales included 7,325 bags of Jiangxi rice, 3,500 bags of Hunan rice, and 591 bags of rice from Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Flour Market Shows Recovery - Factories Covering Short Positions in Near Months - Outsiders Buying in Far Months <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices in each month showed a trend of first declining and then rising. With the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago and Canada both retreated slightly by 0.04 to 0.20 yuan. Therefore, after the opening price, market sentiment was quite depressed. The opening price for the current month was only 0.155 yuan, and the January price was as low as 0.1475 yuan. Other months were also slightly lower by about 0.01 yuan. However, with factories covering short positions in the near months and outsiders still buying in the far months, market sentiment rebounded in the second round and after, improving by about 0.02 yuan compared to the initial opening. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, market sentiment was even better, and trading was also smooth. It was heard that the asking price for spot foreign wheat was higher, and the goods ordered a few days ago were already asking around 0.70 yuan. Therefore, buying activity was revived, and prices rose step by step, rebounding by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan compared to the previous day's close. According to this situation, if foreign wheat cannot be continuously ordered, the market will continue to fluctuate. Spot wheat factory sales are active, continuing to improve by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan, with the opening prices of Lin Huai Guan at 6.70 yuan, Bengbu at 6.65 yuan, Liuhe Jiangbei at 6.60 yuan. Shaoxing was at 6.70 yuan, Bengbu was at 6.65 yuan, and Liuhe Jiangbei was at 6.00 yuan. Fufeng went to 10,000 bags.</p>

<p>There was not much change in the sugar market yesterday. The guild's posted prices were 21.50 yuan for high-quality coarse raw white spot goods, 6.112 yuan for transshipment, and the original prices for Dongbai No. 489 and native cotton white sugar were unchanged. Independent vendors opened 200 cases of spot Beihai sliced green from Guangdong and Hong Kong vendors at 10.70 yuan, up 0.10 yuan. Also, some roadside cargo vendors opened 200 to 300 cases at 10.60 yuan, and 200 cases of Hainan red sugar were priced at 13.80 to 14 yuan, up 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. Xinghua vendors opened 35 pieces of new high-quality sliced green goods at 12 yuan, the highest new price seen since the arrival of new goods.</p>

<p>Honey dates are a poor harvest this year, so market prices initially fell when new goods were released, but then rose again. The current inventory is even more scarce, and market conditions are tightening. Yesterday, Hui Gong Tu Tu were quoted at 47 to 48 yuan on the market, Chong Huo were at 44 to 45 yuan, Lanxi Gao Tu Tu Bang were at 43 to 44 yuan, ordinary were at 40 yuan, and miscellaneous routes were at 36 to 37 yuan. Upper and lower grades are usually adjusted accordingly. There is very little sign of any easing in the future.</p>

<p>Recently, the overseas market for white lead wire has seen prices jump from £6 10s to £8 15s per ton due to supply shortages. Yesterday, the price in this port city also rose sharply as procurement was very high and the base felt a sudden shortage. The price per dan rose from 9 yuan to around 11 yuan. Various vendors are rushing to buy, and construction vendors on this street are also buying. Counterparts are also trying to hoard, so the market is becoming more stable.</p>
<p>Special Report</p>
<h3 id="e213">Reply to Mr. Shen Zhenyi of the Bank of China: The Differences Between Domestic and Foreign Silk Price Calculations <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>Original letter, abridged: Recently, regarding the silk market report on February 4th, it stated, "The price difference between American and French silk and domestic silk is about 20 yuan." On that day (February 4th), the spot price in New York for 20-21 denier silk was between 78.20 and 78.21 cents, which, when converted to Chinese currency and deducting export fees, is approximately 790 yuan. However, the highest price for 20-21 white filature silk listed on the same day was 700 yuan, seemingly indicating that foreign prices are still about 90 yuan higher than Shanghai prices. It is presumed that the silk traded in Shanghai may be of lower quality. However, what standard of raw silk did your newspaper's reporters use to compare with the foreign market? Please clearly indicate this so that we may use it for reference.</p>
<p>(Reply) Regarding your inquiry, the following are the separate answers:</p>
<p>(1) The statement "The difference between domestic and foreign silk prices is about 20 yuan" in the daily silk news refers to a comparison between the price limits of goods wired from foreign countries to Shanghai and the prices held by Shanghai merchants. The silk grade should be the ordinary B grade.</p>
<p>(2) The reason why foreign silk prices cannot perfectly match the sales prices in Shanghai on the same day is threefold:</p>
<p>(A) There are many categories of raw silk. Even within the same white filature, 20-21 denier, the grades can be divided into GXX, Extra, Extra B, and ill grades. Those that cannot be divided include good A grade, good B grade, secondary A grade, secondary B grade, and so on. These grades are determined by the credit and output of their brands. Furthermore, the silk thread itself can be divided into direct-reeled silk, re-reeled silk, "Yangfan" (special reeled) and special "Yangfan." Due to the different silk threads, the prices also vary.</p>
<p>(B) The price of foreign silk needed to arrive in Shanghai includes the asking price of New York silk merchants and the price demanded by overseas buyers. This price has no standard. Therefore, the telegrams received by foreign merchants vary. Moreover, the exchange real-time market prices transmitted by Reuters inevitably have discrepancies. It is even more difficult to match them with the prices held or sold by domestic silk merchants.</p>
<p>(C) The export of Chinese silk is controlled by foreign merchants. It is common for them to be optimistic or pessimistic, release or suppress market prices. The foreign market prices reported in this newspaper are widely provided to silk merchants as a direct indication of foreign sales prices. Its correlation with Shanghai prices is only for reference and therefore cannot be the same as the Shanghai market's "signal" prices. Furthermore, the commissions deducted by foreign merchants also vary, making it impossible to generalize.</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Economic Construction of New Turkey <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Defu</p>
<p>The new Turkey under the rule of Kemal is built upon these three principles: nationalism, secularism, and industrialization. As the first two are not directly related to this issue, they need not be discussed in detail. What we want to present here is the issue of the industrialization of new Turkey.</p>
<p>The past Turkey was based on agriculture and was a semi-colonial land under the joint invasion of European powers. After the end of World War I, especially after the victory over Greece, the new Turkish Republic under Kemal's rule since 1923 has strived for completely independent development in both economic and political aspects. Its most fundamental task is to transform an agricultural country into an industrial one.</p>
<p>However, according to the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey did not have tariff autonomy, which undoubtedly was a major obstacle to the economic construction of new Turkey. According to statistics from 1927, there were only 257,000 industrial workers in Turkey at that time, only three factories with more than 100 workers, and only 321 factories employing more than 50 workers. Their total horsepower was only 165,000 horsepower. As for the raw materials used by industry, they were only 232,666,000 Turkish pounds, and their production value was only 432,740,000 Turkish pounds. Among those factories, the main industries were agricultural industries, metal industries, textile industries, and wood industries; they accounted for 95% of Turkey's total industry. It was not until June 8, 1929, that the government's Grand National Assembly passed the protective tariff bill. This was the initial appearance of statism in the economy of new Turkey, and it was also a manifestation of its beginning to use the balance of foreign trade to seek its own economic independence.</p>
<p>In 1934, new Turkey further imitated the Soviet Union and formulated a five-year plan to implement a planned economy. The important points of this plan were somewhat similar to the Soviet planned economy, that is, to nationalize and operate important industries and pay attention to national defense construction. By last year, the Nationalist Party, Turkey's sole political party, had established a broad economic plan and issued the following declaration on industry: "All industries built for the purpose of Turkey's industrialization, whether private or state-owned, must follow the national plan. Turkish industry must not be partially concentrated, but must integrate the entire country. Therefore, the state must control prices and not allow cartels and trusts to raise prices for ordinary consumers." Regarding labor issues, it also stated: "In all economic enterprises, labor and profit must be harmonized by the state. Employers and laborers must be rationally controlled by labor laws." Such control is not only implemented in industry, but also for farmers. Turkish farmers must not be lazy. The government lends them money at minimal interest to enable them to cultivate land. At the same time, the government also urges farmers to develop underground resources, utilize hydropower, and control forests; and tells farmers, "National electrification is an important factor in the development of the motherland."</p>
<p>Under such an economic plan, Turkey's industries are divided into the following sectors: (1) textile industry (cotton, hemp, wool), (2) metal industry (iron, coal, lignite, copper, sulfur), (3) paper making and artificial ivory industry (paper, artificial ivory, rayon), (4) ceramics industry (ceramics, etc.), (5) chemical industry (sulfuric acid, chlorine, bicarbonate, phosphate). At the same time, there are the following decisions regarding investment in these industrial sectors (unit: thousands of Turkish pounds):</p>
<p>Cotton Spinning and Weaving 18,538</p>
<p>Wool Weaving Industry 11,650</p>
<p>Coal Industry 1,000</p>
<p>Sulfur Industry 300</p>
<p>Artificial Ivory Industry 1,025</p>
<p>Glass Industry 1,250</p>
<p>Chemical Industry 3,000</p>
<p>Hemp Industry 1,700</p>
<p>Iron Industry 10,000</p>
<p>Copper Industry 550</p>
<p>Silk 3,790</p>
<p>Rayon Industry 490</p>
<p>Porcelain Industry 800</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Turkey invests the most in the cotton spinning and weaving industry, followed by the iron industry; these two can be said to be Turkey's most important industries at present. According to the national economic plan, the estimated production volume of major industries is: cotton cloth 100,000,000 meters, hemp yarn 600,000 tons, woolen thread 1,000,000 kilograms, iron 100,000 tons, coal 60,000 tons.</p>
<p>Next is the finance of new Turkey. In order to implement such a planned economy, the Turkish government specially established a special bank in Ankara on June 2, 1933. This bank and the Turkish Bank are the main financial institutions of new Turkey. The former has a total capital of 20 million pounds, and its current capital is 6.2 million pounds; during the implementation of the five-year plan, the government will provide it with 6 million pounds annually; its important tasks are all national investment, distribution of products, control and guidance of economic construction. In terms of industrial investment, this bank is first engaged in the textile and paper industries. In the textile industry, this bank has established three large factories: the first is in Kayseri, the second is in Ereğli, and the third is in Nazilli. Among these three factories, the third can be said to be one of the largest and most modern factories in Europe. It has a total of 23,000 spindles, produces 30 million meters of cotton cloth annually, and consumes 560 kilograms of Turkish cotton. The number of spindles in the first factory is 25,000, and it produces 17 million meters of cotton cloth annually. The smaller second factory also has the capacity to produce 7 million meters of cotton cloth. Almost all of Turkey's required cotton cloth is supplied by these three factories.</p>
<p>This bank also invests heavily in the paper industry. Turkey's largest paper factory in İzmit was established with its investment. This factory alone will produce 50% of the paper needed in Turkey.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the iron industry, which is very important for both the national economy and national defense. This bank has been investing in its construction since last year and is currently planning its development.</p>
<p>As for the Turkish Bank, it was established as early as 1924, with only a capital of 1 million pounds at that time. Now its capital has increased to 5 million pounds (the pounds in this article are all Turkish pounds; please do not mistake them for British pounds). The investment activities of this bank first began in 1928 with the establishment of Turkey's earliest sugar factory. Its decision is to strive to invest in the mining industry, especially the coal industry. In 1926, it established the Turkish Coal Company in Zonguldak with a capital of 1 million pounds. Subsequently, it established a coal company in Kozlu, with an initial capital of 500,000 pounds, which was increased to 3 million pounds in 1929. Although this bank is nominally private, it is actually controlled by the Turkish Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>In addition to the above two major banks, there is also the Central Bank of the Turkish government, with a current capital of 160 million pounds. This bank undoubtedly controls important national financial functions.</p>
<p>What needs to be specially mentioned now is Turkey's natural resources and their development, which can be said to be an important foundation for the economic construction of new Turkey.</p>
<p>Turkey spans the two continents of Asia and Europe, with a population of 15 million and an area of 294,000 square miles. Speaking of its products, the richest are minerals. Its chromium and emery powder rank first in the world. Coal production is also very famous; Zonguldak on the Black Sea coast is the largest coal production area in the Near East. At the same time, Turkey is also working hard to exploit minerals; its coal production in 1923 was only 600,000 tons, but by 1934 it had increased to 2,180,000 tons. The production of silver is also considerable, about 8,000 tons per year. Although the production of sulfur is currently only 3,500 tons, according to the five-year plan, the annual production should be more than 1.5 million tons. The production of chromium, emery powder, manganese, and lignite was 120,000 tons in 1934, and of course there are still increases now. In addition, the production of copper, iron, and petroleum is also quite large.</p>
<p>Turkey's agricultural resources are also very rich, which can be indicated by the following figures (unit: hectare) —</p>
<p>Land suitable for cultivation 23,157,300</p>
<p>Valuable forest area 10,000,000</p>
<p>Pasture 27,000,000</p>
<p>Among the cultivated land, 90% is suitable for grain cultivation; and the area of wheat and barley accounts for 85% of it. The cultivated area of cotton is also increasing, and its center is in Adana.</p>
<p>Turkey is also a place where water vegetables are produced. Such as grapes, figs, olives, etc., it exports them every year. Under the provisions of the five-year plan, the output of these items has also increased significantly; compared to the past, they have increased by more than double.</p>
<p>In the economic construction of new Turkey, along with the development of general industries, railway construction has also achieved great results. By the end of last year, the railways built by the government had exceeded 6,000 miles; and it is planned to build 7,000 miles of railways from 1936 to 1940. If this continues, it will undoubtedly promote the further development of Turkey's economy. Of course, Turkey's economic development has not changed the nature of its society, but this is beside the point, and there is no need to discuss it here.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Basil Zaharoff, the European Arms Merchant <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingxian</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, death struck Sir Basil Zaharoff, who resided in Monte Carlo, the capital of the gambling country Monaco, on the French border. The life of Zaharoff was full of story-like mysterious legends. He was a famous "arms king" of Europe. His words could influence the politics of various countries and the fate of various nations. From his youth to his possession of absolute and immense authority, he was always regarded as a "mysterious person," and was feared and respected by some monarchs and great politicians in Europe.</p>
<p>There are many legends about his origins. According to official records, he was born in 1850. "Basil Zaharoff of Paris was his father." During the European War, British Prime Minister Lloyd George wanted to know more about the background of this arms merchant who was responsible for supplying the Allied countries with arms, so he entrusted the British Secret Intelligence Service to investigate. As a result, it was discovered that Zaharoff was born in Constantinople. His father was Russian, and his mother was Greek.</p>
<p>In his childhood, he was sent by his father to England for studies. In addition to studying English, he quickly learned French, Spanish, Italian, and Arabic. When his father passed away, he left him an inheritance of £40,000. After leaving school, he quickly gambled away almost all of his inheritance. The life of the following years is difficult to investigate. Some say that he drifted to New York and other cities in the United States and worked as a journalist, but this cannot be verified. His participation in international events did not begin until the early years after he turned sixty. At that time, he was supplying arms to Egypt and the upper reaches of the Nile.</p>
<p>Subsequently, he was appointed as the manager of the Vickers armaments factory in Athens, becoming an important figure in Greek political circles. His career as an arms merchant began in the Near East. He traded in all kinds of arms. He once served as the manager of the Vickers armaments factory in Paris, specializing in arms trade with Russia. It is said that during the Russo-Japanese War, he contracted to build warships for Russia and made a lot of money.</p>
<p>Although he was an arms merchant, he was also a politician in Europe. He often served as an intermediary between Briand and Lloyd George. Later, he shuttled between Lloyd George and Clemenceau, negotiating the politics of Europe between Britain and France. During that period, he was regarded as a "mysterious person," because he traveled between London and Paris, often traveling back and forth in the middle of the night, and his travels were all on a destroyer, crossing the English Channel.</p>
<p>One of the most story-like events in his life was what happened in Madrid, the capital of Spain, when he was over seventy years old. As he was coming down the grand staircase in the palace, he suddenly saw a young man in aristocratic attire grabbing a young woman by the neck and shaking her incessantly. So he rushed up and intervened. The young woman was knocked over and almost fell, so he embraced her with his arm. Unexpectedly, this young man was Duke Francisco, a member of the Spanish Bourbon royal family and nephew of the Spanish King. The young woman was the Duke's wife, Magina, who was only twenty years old at the time.</p>
<p>This was a very interesting scene. But from this scene, Zaharoff began to develop a friendship with the Duchess. Duke Francisco subsequently became mentally deranged, and his family imprisoned him in a villa in the suburbs. He died in 1924, and in that same year, Zaharoff married the Duchess and lived happily in Paris, Nice, and Monte Carlo. Unexpectedly, only eighteen months after the marriage, Zaharoff's wife suddenly died, which was a great blow to Zaharoff. From then on, he rarely appeared in public.</p>
<p>He had many residences. In France, the Villa Balincourt in Auberive was one of the most exquisite. It was originally the property of Prince Billya Paulte and is one of the most beautiful villas in France. All the artistic decorations were collected from all over France over forty years. All the furnishings inside are also very exquisite. There is also a pond behind it for Zaharoff to row boats. However, he always lived in Monte Carlo in winter. It is said that after the Great War, Zaharoff held immense power in Monte Carlo. In the Monte Carlo Grand Theatre, which was modeled after the Paris Opera, there were three special boxes. The center box was occupied by the Prince of Monaco, the left box was Zaharoff's, and the right box was reserved by the theater owner for members of the royal family and the owners of various casinos.</p>
<p>In middle age, Zaharoff was slightly taller than the average person and had a thin appearance. When he was eighty years old, he had a total property of £200,000,000. In recent years, the mystery of his life has increased and progressed with age. The recent burning of his diary is an example. His diary contained records of daily events and criticisms of contemporary figures. Fearing that it would be discovered by others after his death, he specially assigned six secretaries to sort it out and burn it.</p>
<p>He often gave away the colored paper from cigar bands to his friends as a sign of good luck. He also had some superstitions, but he was particularly superstitious about the colored paper on cigar bands.</p>
<p>Although he was one of the behind-the-scenes figures in the international community, the villagers near the Villa Balincourt did not know that he was the richest man in Europe.</p>
<p>Now Zaharoff is dead, and the secrets of his life will forever remain secrets. Some say that his career will end with this. But others say that even though he is dead, his power still exists. But what the truth is, I am afraid that only a very few people in the European political arena know.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Evaluation of Cultural Sociology <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yi</p>
<p>Sociology is a science that was established only a few decades ago, and cultural sociology is an even more recent product, established after the European War, and is still in its infancy. Therefore, not only are people generally unfamiliar with cultural sociology, some are even quite skeptical or even opposed to it, and some misunderstand it, but even those who consider themselves to be proponents or supporters of it have various opinions and cannot agree on a single view. This discipline (or rather, this school of thought) originated in Germany after the European War, and figures such as Max Weber, Durkheim, and Spengler all advocated it. Later, the United States inherited and responded to this view, and it became popular for a time. As for our China, it also followed the footsteps of the United States, bringing this newly emerging cultural sociology into this backward China from the "second-hand," and applying it widely, even considering it as its own discovery, such as Sun Benwen being its main figure. In Japan, figures such as Tanaka Odo, Miyauchi no Tasuke, Tsuda Sokichi, and Nishimura Shinji can all be said to be scholars of the cultural sociology school, both before and after.</p>
<p>Regardless of how many people advocate or support it, no one has yet systematically written a book on cultural sociology. Our understanding of it mostly comes from various magazine articles, or from incidental mentions in ordinary sociology works, and some sociology outlines or principles of sociology are simply written from the perspective of the cultural sociology school, but labeled with the name of cultural sociology, except for Kan Eikichi's "Cultural Sociology" in Japan and a few thin books like "Social Cultural Foundations" and "Cultural Theory of Sociology" in our backward China, there are practically none in the world. Because of this, it is necessary to give a simple description of what cultural sociology actually is, whether it is worthy of being called a science, and what its content is.</p>
<p>When we first see the term "cultural sociology," we cannot help but wonder: is this "sociology" or "cultural studies"? If it is sociology, then it can only be said that this is the sociology of the cultural school, like the sociology of the biological school, the sociology of the materialistic historical view school, the sociology of the idealistic historical view school, etc. How can we add the two characters of culture to the overall name of sociology? If it is cultural studies, then this is just a branch of cultural studies that studies culture from a sociological perspective, and cannot be called "cultural sociology." Therefore, generally speaking, cultural sociology does not fear how many people advocate or use it, but in reality, it is still an inappropriate term.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we examine the content of cultural sociology as defined by the cultural sociology school. As they say, "Cultural sociology is the study of understanding culture according to social regulations (modern German and Japanese sociology)." (See "Cultural Sociology") This is very unreasonable. Since it is "the study of understanding culture," then why is it called "sociology"? When we look at the content it lists, there is "the national character of culture," "the class nature of culture," "the time-bound nature of culture," etc. This proves that it is dealing with culture and not with society, and should belong to cultural studies and not to sociology. We also see Durkheim's "Sociology of Religion" and Scheler's "Sociology of Knowledge." Among these, such as religion and knowledge, all belong to culture, and the study of religion or knowledge is part of cultural studies, and their so-called "cultural sociology" is also a general name for cultural studies. But we also see Sun Benwen saying in his book "Social Cultural Foundations": "A group of people who have a common culture and therefore express common behavior is a society." "Without culture, there is no society; society exists in culture." "Society is the product of culture." In this way, the study of culture is sociology. Because culture is the mother of society and the foundation of society. As long as culture is studied clearly, society will also be studied clearly. Therefore, cultural studies is sociology. The reason why it is called "cultural sociology" is to distinguish it from other schools of sociology. Looking at Scheler's words again: "The pluralism of groups and cultural forms is the starting point of all sociology." He does not agree with the idealistic monistic sociology of German ideologues, and also opposes materialistic monistic sociology, believing that neither spirit nor matter alone is sufficient to explain the structure of society, and neither can determine the development of society. Only by taking various cultural elements, such as religion, philosophy, and other spiritual cultures, plus material culture, and having these various elements interact with each other, can we explain the development of society. From these points of view, the so-called "cultural sociology" is again sociology. In short, this term is not only theoretically incomprehensible, difficult to understand, and inappropriate, but even they themselves have not figured it out clearly.</p>
<p>Based on the above, regardless of what cultural studies is, summarizing the opinions of various schools, it takes various cultures, such as national character, class nature, time-bound nature, religion, knowledge, etc., as the spiritual and material elements of society, believing that the interaction of these elements constitutes society and determines the development of society. Compared with idealistic sociology and materialistic sociology, it is a pluralistic sociology. It does not only use spirit or economy to explain society, but also uses everything that should be available, such as nation, era, race, ethnicity, geography, climate, class, occupation, etc. to explain it.</p>
<p>We have explained "cultural sociology" very briefly, and now we want to evaluate it based on the object we are grasping.</p>
<p>As the cultural sociologists say: society is a chaotic mass, woven from various cultures, "society is the product of culture." Various cultures only have interaction with each other, but no determining effect. But according to science, the structure of society has its underlying foundation and superstructure. The underlying foundation is the economic structure, and the superstructure is the legal and political system and various ideologies. As for the so-called culture, such as capitalist culture, such as feudal culture, all kinds of thoughts and academic studies belong to the field of ideology, and are the superstructure of society. Scientific research is to explain fundamentally, to develop the causal laws, and merely mutual interaction — Please continue on the fifth edition.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>is not enough. Culture is determined by the economic structure, which is known to everyone. As for culture being able to have a counter-effect on its superstructure, and causing interaction between each other, that goes without saying; however, the ultimate determinant is still its foundation, which is the scientific explanation. The task of sociology is to explain this structure of society and the causal laws of the evolution and development of this structure of society. In this way, cultural sociology not only cannot explain the true structure of society, but also does not know its laws of development. It has failed to complete the task of sociology at all. So whether it can become a science is still questionable.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Who Made This Year's Harvest Abundant? <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows the name "bacteria," right? This thing that hygienists see as a venomous snake is the great hero that made our harvest abundant this year!</p>
<p>Don't believe it? Listen to me explain: In our country, farmers mostly use manure to fertilize the fields. When hygienists see it, they always cover their noses and pass by, saying it's unsanitary. But they don't know that all the food that fills their bellies needs, and is precisely cultivated by, these unsanitary manures. This is because manure contains the most chlorine, which meets the needs of plants. We see this manure sprinkled on the soil, and after a few days, it disappears, while the plants in the soil grow vigorously. At this time, if we examine it carefully, we will know that these manures must first ferment, decay, and be transformed into other substances before plants can absorb them. The bacteria that cause this manure to decay and change are the aforementioned hero. The ability of bacteria lies in their ability to make things decay. This is certainly harmful to the human body, but in agriculture, its contribution is even greater than that of cattle and horses. The chlorine in manure is contained in complex chemical compounds, so when bacteria arrive, they use their great power to make the manure decay. After that, the substances contained within are each decomposed, and after decomposition, they are each combined again, and then transformed into nitrate-like substances for plants to use.</p>
<p>The reason why soils are fertile or barren lies in whether there are many or few of these decaying things. The vast desert has no produce because bacteria do not like to grow there, which is due to the lack of humus. This kind of humus does not have a fixed composition, but through chemical experiments, we know that it is formed by the combination of organisms and minerals. In short, it is organic matter, containing the most protein. However, even with these humus materials alone, without the power of bacteria to help them ferment and combine, they are still of no benefit to crops. This is because before humus decomposes, its structure is extremely complex, and plants cannot directly absorb it. It must be fermented and decayed by bacteria, transforming complex substances into simple ones, and then, through several stages of bacterial fermentation, the nitrogen in the protein combines with other substances to become potassium nitrate or magnesium nitrate. These substances can then make plants thrive and develop.</p>
<p>This situation can be seen by observing the life of leguminous plants, such as peas and alfalfa. It can be known that the statement that bacteria are the heroes that make agricultural products abundant is definitely not false. If we pull up a pea plant to look at it, don't you see countless nodule-shaped things on those root hairs, some as small as mustard seeds, others as large as peas? If you try to remove these small nodules, the pea plant will gradually wither, and the peas that grow will also be small and few. What are these small nodules? They are packages of bacteria.</p>
<p>The growth of peas must require a large amount of nitrogen, which is to say, it needs a large amount of protein in plants. Although there is a lot of nitrogen in the air, plants themselves cannot freely absorb it, but the nodules on the root hairs of peas have this ability. They can grab a large amount of chlorine from the air and send it to the pea plant to use as nutrients.</p>
<p>The bacteria on pea roots not only help the growth of pea plants, but also turn barren soil into fertile soil. In Illinois, USA, there is a farm that specifically tested the effectiveness of bacteria on soil. They specifically divided the farm into three areas: A, B, and C. Area A was exclusively planted with corn, area B was planted with wheat or millet, rotating yearly, and area C was alternated with millet, wheat, or alfalfa, changing every year in a set cycle. After twenty-eight years, the yield of corn per acre in the three areas was twenty English bushels in area A, thirty-six English bushels in area B, and fifty-nine English bushels in area C, more than double that of area A! This is the contribution of bacteria on the pea roots.</p>
<p>The two most useful types of bacteria for plants are nitrite bacteria, which can convert the ammonia odor produced after the decay of substances into nitrite, and nitrate bacteria, which can take the chlorine in the protein of humus to create nitrate.</p>
<p>In modern times, with the flourishing of science, soil reformers often give a thumbs up and praise the effectiveness of their fertilizers. In reality, all fertilizers are nothing more than compounds with a large amount of nitrogen, and this nitrogen, like the nitrogen in the air, can absolutely not reach the plants without the help of bacteria.</p>
<p>Besides carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, the growth of plants also requires calcium, magnesium, potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, iron, and other elements. But it is definitely not the case that plants can thrive by sprinkling those elements seen in the chemistry lab on the ground, because every element must go through the fermentation, decay, and manufacturing of bacteria before it can be used.</p>
<p>Because our country has reported good harvests in various provinces and regions this year, the villagers have flocked to temples to burn incense, thanking the Bodhisattvas for their protection. They do not know that the only hero that made this year's harvest abundant—bacteria—is still silently and inconspicuously continuing their work underground!</p>

<h3 id="e218">Zola and the French People <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Fu</p>
<p>On the anniversary of the death of the French novelist Émile Zola this year, the French literary community held a meeting at Zola's former villa in Médan, near Paris, to express their commemoration. The Minister of Education, Talent, presided over the memorial ceremony and delivered a speech. He said, roughly, "The government is trying to improve the fate of the working class. The French working class has the virtues of thrift and peace. Zola knew this best and loved them most deeply." Zola was the leader of naturalism. Although he sympathized with the common people and workers of France in some respects, in the end, what he depicted was still "a world that French citizens created based on their own models." He himself was still a bourgeois figure. Now, the People's Front government in France, led by the Socialist Party, and a group of progressive literary authors in France, are holding a special meeting to commemorate him and say that he was the person who loved the French workers the most. This may seem difficult to explain, but upon closer examination, the meaning is very clear.</p>
<p>Zola was a French writer active in the latter half of the 19th century, and what he depicted was French society during the Second Empire and the Third Republic. Compared to Flaubert, Maupassant, and even all naturalist writers, he paid more attention to reality and worked harder to "expose the truth nakedly." He ruthlessly exposed the decadent lives of the French aristocracy at the time, accusing them of "treating prostitutes and street girls as the flowers of the nation" ("Nana"). He vividly depicted the greed of urban citizens and rural landowners (such as "The Belly of Paris" and "The Earth"), the fraud of a group of figures in the stock exchange ("Money"), and the pitiful and ridiculous vanity of the petty bourgeoisie who "buy bad beef but decorate the table with flowers" ("Pot-Bouille"). He opposed exploitation and expressed sympathy for the working masses, which can be clearly seen in "Germinal" and "Labor". In order to depict the tragic situation of the Franco-Prussian War, he created "The Debacle." In this, we can see his anti-war consciousness, although it is not very clear or thorough.</p>
<p>In 1894, under the sway of a crazed anti-Semitic consciousness, the French authorities basely fabricated some facts, alleging that Captain Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish French artillery officer, was suspected of leaking military secrets to the Germans. Thus, the famous Dreyfus affair in French history broke out, which can also be said to be an anti-Semitic, so-called "Jewish peril" event. In this event, French political parties were divided into two major camps: on the one hand, the royalists and other anti-Semitic forces, who not only insisted that Captain Dreyfus was guilty, but also fundamentally opposed the republican system; on the other hand, the radical socialist party and the socialist party camp, who not only exposed the authorities' conspiracy to frame Dreyfus and protested against the anti-Semitic fanatics, but also fought to protect the republican system. The great writer Zola was living in France at this time, and he certainly had to express his opinion on this event that shook the country. So he wrote an essay to vindicate Captain Dreyfus and rebuke the unreasonable anti-Semitic movement. However, this result angered the French authorities, who immediately ordered his arrest, even forcing him to flee to England, until the Captain's wrongful case was clarified before he could return to his homeland.——Why do we not hesitate to describe this event here? That is because in this event, it can be fully seen how much Zola loved truth and justice, and it can also be seen how consistent his actions and his real life were with his creative attitude.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the conscious citizens of France at that time still loved Zola, because their society still had the possibility of continued development, their lives still had a future, so they could still fairly face reality, and they were not yet hostile to Zola, who depicted objective reality. Moreover, although Zola depicted the ugly side of French bourgeois life, he was "seeking remedies for the shortcomings of the bourgeoisie in bourgeois morality" (Professor Cogan's comment on him), which should be especially praised by truly cultured citizens. Therefore, those who hated Zola at that time were not French citizens, but the French aristocracy, conservatives, and churches, etc. For example, the Catholic poets Barbey d'Aurevilly said that he was "a despicable artist" and ridiculed him as "a disgusting Michelangelo."</p>
<p>What about now? Capitalism has entered the final stage of its demise. In the course of history, the bourgeois class, like the aristocracy of the nineteenth century, has become a group of people who dare not face reality. What is expressed in terms of ideology is that Nietzsche's superman philosophy, new heroism, and mysticism have replaced scientific truth, liberalism, and realism. Thus, those who fear reality, oppose democracy and freedom, and oppose Jews are no longer the aristocracy that has been crushed by the wheels of history, but the bourgeoisie who are trying to stop the wheels of history from moving forward with their last efforts. This situation is particularly evident in Germany and Italy. As for the situation in France, although it is somewhat different from that in Germany and Italy, the financial capitalists, military industrialists, speculators in the stock exchange, and the followers of Colonel de la Rocque (leader of the Croix-de-Feu), are now inheriting the position of the French aristocracy of the nineteenth century, following in the footsteps of Mr. Hitler in Germany, working hard to oppose the republican system, oppose pacifism, and oppose the Jews, attempting to use new heroism and Nietzsche's mysticism to be enemies of truth and justice. If such a large French bourgeois presented all of Zola's literary heritage before them, they would never accept it. At this time, those who can promote his spirit of facing reality and loving truth and justice are only the French workers and progressive people. Therefore, those who commemorate Zola and give him the highest evaluation are not the great citizens of France, but the French People's Front and general progressive writers.</p>
<p>Of course, it is an overestimation to say that Zola knew the French workers "most deeply" and "loved them most deeply." From all aspects, we can only say that he was a progressive bourgeois writer, a reformist, because although he depicted the dark side of capitalist society, he did not fundamentally negate that social system, and he did not even know who would use what methods to reform that society. Perhaps the reason why the Socialist Party people overestimate him is precisely here. However, for the groups of people who can truly bear new historical tasks, everything about Zola must be accepted critically.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Sex Life of African Natives <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Seven thousand concubines in the harem. From the perspective of modern civilized people, polygamy is unreasonable no matter what. However, in the evolutionary process of history, there was indeed a period when polygamy existed. At that time, women were completely slaves of men, private property: if a man had a lot of property, he could marry many wives and concubines. For example, a chieftain-like figure would often have several subordinates, rob several branches, have several heads of livestock, several leopard skins, several cowrie shells (currency), and the equivalent of these in wives and concubines. This situation still actually exists among the natives of Africa today.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of so-called polygamy is extremely common in the places where African natives live, and one can almost always see a man raising a large number of wives and concubines. For example, in the Bunya region of Uganda, most chiefs have ten to fifteen wives and concubines; even the poor have at least three or four wives and concubines. The rich of the Nandi tribe in the Kenya highlands have forty wives and concubines at any given time. In the Lezalis region of French Congo, there is a famous person called Berlin...
