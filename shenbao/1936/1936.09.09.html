<h3>最近「凱陀賽」外交的活躍</h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>在最近數天中歐洲侵略集團的活動是非常可以注意的西班牙的叛軍在國際法西斯勢力的積極援助下已經佔領了該國北部的軍事重鎮伊倫城戰後不曾踏出國門一步的匈牙利攝政霍才却借了「行獵」之名訪問德奧二國重要首領以圖建立反蘇聯的防錢羅馬尼亞內閣的改組已染上了了國社黨的色彩德國義務兵役時期的延長使它平時得擁有百萬以上的大兵而法西斯的二大巨頭最近還有在德國會晤的傳說從這些事實來看侵略集團的活動似已有總動員的狀態了</p>
<p>與這侵略集團的活動相對照的是「凱陀賽」外交的活躍自從人民政府成立以後法國就已成為和平陣綫中的重要支柱在这次西班牙的內戰中法國所提出的不干涉恊定允為維護國際和平的重要工具誠如法總理勃倫於六日在塞納省社會黨大會中所說「假使讓各國向西班牙政府軍與叛軍雙方競事供給軍火則對於全歐局勢必將發生無窮的禍患而不干涉恊定的締結就是為防止這禍患的」現在不干涉西班牙內戰恊定雖經很久的談判始行簽訂成立它的實效如何還待以後事實的證明但這個協定的成立巳使德意等國失了供給叛軍軍火的藉口同時並暫時防止伊比里亞半島的戰事之擴展為全歐洲之侵略陣綫與和平陣綫的大决戰凱陀賽、外交的和平目的已因此達到了相當的成功</p>
<p>「凱陀賽」外交的活躍範圍不僅限於消極方面擁護和平防止戰爭的擴大而且還在積極方面增原擁護和平的力量最明顯的例子就是法波關係的改善於今日簽訂財政軍事協定由法國以二十二萬五千萬法郞分五年貸舉波蘭其中一部由波蘭政府自由分配一部向蘇聯購買原料一部則向法國購買軍火用以革新波蘭的陸軍而促其機械化這個軍事財政恊定的成立可以說是最近凱陀賽外交的大成功</p>
<p>法波軍事財政恊定之所以含有重大的意義是有歷史上的原因的我們知道戰後波蘭的能够獨立大部是賴法國的帮助因此兩國間曾締有軍事同盟條約但到了一九三四年時這個為法國外圍勢力的波蘭却投入德國的懷抱中在外交上處處與德意集團沆瀣一氣而其與法國的同盟條約雖未取消但關係却日漸疏遠起來同時對於法國的東歐同盟國家如捷克蘇聯等國又採取敵視的態度波蘭的這種外交政策當然是增長侵略陣綫的氣焰的可是到了最近波蘭因感到同德國勾結在一起倒底沒有好處（因為在將來大戰中卽使侵略集團戰勝波蘭也有被併於第三帝國的危險）於是同法國的關係重又好轉在上月中旬時法國陸軍參謀總長甘茂林首先往訪華沙當局現在波蘭的最高權力者陸軍敎育總監里資米格里又報聘巴黎終於締成了軍事財政協定使二國的軍事同盟關係獲得更鞏固的保障里資米格里又向法國保證放棄其對捷克的敵視態度同時因為法國的借欵有一部是規定購買蘇聯的原料的那末波蘇的過去敵對關係當也有相當改善的可能所以这次法波軍事財政協定的成立不但增强了法國的軍事力量而且也使和平陣綫的勢力大形增加其意義的重大不言可喩而這種局勢的演變却是最近「凱陀賽」外交的活躍底最大成果</p>

<h3>俄報抨擊　德報反俄宣傳</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）關於德國報紙之反蘇宣傳、莫斯科新聞特撰社論云、</p>
<p>「國際新聞界已有多决機會可以深信此種反蘇新聞宣傳决非法西斯蒂記者之自由創造物、而係德國宣傳部有組織有系統之宣傳、正因係在德宣傳部命令之下、德報界方全部動員散佈關於紅軍人數之不確消息、</p>
<p>「此輩利用蘇聯减低徵兵年齡之法律為藉口、然彼等實深知此法律實際决不增加紅軍人數、紅軍之現狀正如蘇政府公佈之消息、尚與以前相同、此全世界所知者、故德國報所載紅軍人數消息全係偽造、亦全球新聞界所深悉、全球報界並可明悉此種反蘇宣傳實為德國掩飾自已兵力增加二倍之用」、</p>
<p>論及德報所播烏克蘭飢饉、人民暴動、兵民衝突、紅軍兵士及軍官不聽指揮等偽消息、該報云、「德報雖偽造此種誹語、然彼實深知紅軍與人民問從未發生過衝突、正相反、全國勞工均對紅軍異常摯愛與尊敬、彼宣傳部之誣蔑紅軍、正因紅軍係德帝國主義及軍國主義侵略政策實現之大障礙、</p>
<p>「各國駐莫斯科之記者已屢决證明德國所播烏克蘭飢饉消息之虛偽、彼等已與蘇聯報紙共同證明本年烏克蘭收成决不不在去年之下、而全蘇收成實均比去年更佳、尤以德報所稱發生飢民暴動之奧迭薩省為特別良好、戈培爾之作此讕言、顯因需要掩飾渠本國食物日缺之情形、蓋無疑也、</p>
<p>「關於近頃托齊恐怖黨徒之公開審判、德報亦大放謠言、云政府人員、紅軍軍官及外交官員多人被捕、此種讕言之可笑已早被蘇政府官報揭破矣、</p>
<p>「德報散佈謠言並採取一種卑劣無恥之手段、如偽稱該消息係駐蘇各城市記者所發、實際該城市並無德記者、此種方法自亦係德宣傳部所授、渠等有時甚至在自製消息之上、列一實際無有之地</p>
<p>「德國官辦通訊社亦坦白參加此項誣蔑工作、彼專採取挑撥民族仇恨之路綫、卽希特勒在其「我的奮鬥」中所提出者、</p>
<p>「此種挑撥民族惡威之目的與方法、在目前反蘇宣傳中可以明見、並為德國一貫政策之特徵、旣已如以、則對德國新聞界或對鼓動彼等之德政府作任何勸告、或抗議、或警告、均屬無用矣、</p>
<p>「不正確之消息使國際關係更複雜、並增加不安及恐慌、然德政府之組織並發展此種反蘇宣傳、則顯係有意增加全世界之不安與恐慌、全世界擁護和平之人士必須對此繼續不斷之反蘇宣傳特別注意，必須動員一切國家之輿論與之奮鬥、以掃除此從柏林來對於和平之新威脅、」（八日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>泰州國貨營業所訪問記</h3>
<p>— 喬耘飱</p>
<p>筆者在去年夏季，曾就管見所及，寫過一篇縣城裏應設國貨專銷機關的文字，便是規模較小的國貨市塲，俾一般內地士女，對提倡國貨知所適從，本刋主編潘仰堯先生，並加按語，表示熱烈同情；時未間歲，縣城裏居然有專營國貨的市塲發現了，欣喜之餘，特趨訪問；泰州卽今之泰縣，它本包括泰束兩縣，東台沒有城池，曩隸泰州，現在泰縣東台比鄰而處，「泰州國貨營業所」，而不稱「縣」。大槪裏下河，甚至揚八屬，土著的大羣認識泰州，比較認識泰縣深切；這和蘇州吳縣正相彷彿，也是生意圈裏的技巧吧：該所位置北門外坡子街，這條市廛，和蘇州的觀前街，揚州的多子街，是一樣暄關繁盛的，經理薛屏藩君，歲方適壯，是位英年有為的幹才，他態度和藹，允為國貨界的一座屏藩；彼此談話，他籍貫靖江，該所胚胎孕育於江南實業區的梁溪，為無錫總經理處的支流，無錫國產商品經理處，發生「五卅慘案」以後！華洋業商人痛漏巵日深！怒焉憂之！組織大同國產商品經理處，是華洋雜貨業的聯合戰錢，現在標幟益鮮，更名國貨市塲，承銷上海各大工廠純粹國產；如棉織印花類鋼精器皿類，化裝品類，橡膠類，搪瓷類，電池類，家庭日用品類；啟明棉織廠，家庭工業社，中國化學工業社，梁新記牙刷廠，大柬橡膠廠，中央電池廠，立興水瓶廠，五和織造廠，都是他推銷的鵠的；泰州國貨營業所，仰承總處營業方針，體例大同小異；泰縣門市不廣，側重募批，有常川專員，向百貨業推銷，薛君以為這樣做，舶來品便無由駐足！該所占地雖不廣，陳設尚合新興商業規律，並有印刷品，以資宣傳，價目表上有這樣幾句弁言：「本所承上海各大國貨工廠之委託，為便利泰縣，東台，興化，鹽城，阜寗等各縣之百貨商號採辦起見，特設國貨營業所於寨州；開辦以來，瞬經……，抱定忠實服務與努力宣揚國貨為主旨！……」看了這幾句話，便知道它的志趣所在，末了我以為批發固應注意，門市也該當推廣，薛先生點首稱是，我們乃相與珍重道別。</p>

<h3>幾年來提倡國貨之果實</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>啖果食，人都好之，且謂其甘美可口也。詎不知下種之時，栽培壅土，施肥摘草，中間已費去幾許之歲同幾許之精神，與多少之力量，多少之成本，始得上口稱甘，嘖嘖歎美。也許果實成熟之頃，而下種者已不在人間世矣，「前人種樹後人凉」，「成功不必自我」，在種樹人之存心如此，惟後之食其賜者，却不可忘其澤也。</p>
<p>一昨在市民提倡國貨會席上，列席者盛道年來提倡國貨之舉，可謂風發雲湧，勢如破竹，上自官廳，下至家庭，有所談，談國貨，有所問，問國貨，小兒所唱，唱國貨，文人為文，為國貨，電臺播音，播國貨。最近新生活運動之要項，為服用國貨，國民經濟建設運動之大綱，為提倡國貨。凡政府之通令，報章雜誌之所載，國貨文字，連篇累讀。猗歟盛哉，國貨之絢爛，至今日而極，國人居今日而不服用國貨，是眞喪心病狂是非中國民族矣。允可慰者，酒館飯店之侍者，進酒進水，多持國貨饗客，小兒製服，非用國貨衣料不願上身。天祚中國復興之機，行有望矣。同時提倡國貨數十年之干介安君，作而歎曰：二十年前吾人提倡國貨，人皆竊笑，不視之為迂闊，卽譏之為多事，甚有以戇人目之者，蓋當時國人缺乏愛國思想，國貨亦粗笨窳劣，摩登之士，以來路貨為時髦，舶來品為榮耀，與談國貨，掩耳却走，的口燒音，成效幾何？且曲高和寡有誰贊同，有誰附和，更有誰聽命，不謂二十年後，有今日煊赫焜煨，轟動於國內外之一日。言時老淚盈眶，舉座為之動容。吾人敢為諸君告慰曰：不有昔日，安有今朝，有昔日之下種，始得今朝之果實，天下事不經艱苦，不能成功。况以今日國貨之情形，未許樂觀，尚未可謂已至食果之時。害蟲遍野，莠草滿地，尚待吾會奮鬥耕耘，切實努力，繼續不斷為提倡國貨之運動。則甘美之果實，始可永永可口，質諸熱心國貨之邦人以為何如？</p>
<h3>國貨藥水電精燈之新活躍</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>國貨中最新發明之「藥水電精燈」，前雖略見報載，但歷久未有續訊，查是項最初發明者，為華一工業社，惟僅製成樣品，於本年六月間，送呈實部請求專利，繼以資本短絀，及候部批，暫行停頓，迺最近又有王某吳某者，亦研究製造此燈，已告成功，刻正積極趕製大批出品，殆所謂後來居上，聞巳定於九月中，將開始為裝戶接綫裝置云云，按此燈最困難之點，卽為配合藥水手續，（藥水亦國產品）蓋將利用藥水，以通電流，至其裝綫情形，與普通電燈相仿，惟燈泡則係特製者，且每燈必須置藥水瓶箱一具，多裝則類推，藥水可供一百五十小時之用，其電費較普通電燈可省三分之二，故訂裝之戶，已有多家，是誠國貨界中之新貢獻矣！</p>
<h3>一週間國貨新訊</h3>

<p>南洋商業考察團，昨電告已於四日離吧城，刻安抵新加坡，華僑熱烈歡迎。上海機製國貨工廠聯合會組織促進同業公會委員會，推胡西園顧炳元等五人為委員。</p>

<h3>英印棉價同回小　—三品紗花漲跌互見—</h3>
<p>昨美棉停市、英棉現貨跌九點、期貨跌四至六點、印棉初因空戶抵補、成交不多而漲、同業均抱觀望態度、後因據報古巨拉及開庶華兩地獲得益雨而跌、計平果爾跌一羅比半、奧姆辣及白羅溪跌二羅比、原電錄左、（七日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、八日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百十四羅比半、漲〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣為一百九十二羅比、漲〇·二五羅比、平果爾為一百五十六羅比半、漲〇·二五羅比、</p>

<h3>疋頭棉布大走動　津粵陜豫均有添辦　內地配貨驟增數倍</h3>
<p>昨棉布標紗花平疲、而現紗走銷繼續良好、巿勢頗佳、津粵二帮、棉布亦有大額採辦、津帮進英商怡和廠十一磅三兎粗布·十二磅三兎粗斜·十一磅貓鷹粗斜·及申新新裕慶豐等廠十六磅粗布等貨四百餘件、綸昌及恒豐廠印花直貢嗶嘰美恒與達豐等廠綫呢、嗶嘰漂布亦辦進百餘件、兩廣旺購本下月期本廠細斜、成交達千餘件、細斜貨額一致缺乏、市盤亦微挺五分之譜、白貨粗布細布嗶嘰綫呢印花貨採辦亦殷、陝豫等帮、印花及染色布疋需要仍佳、近地秋銷大旺、各內路客家來滬配貨、品目繁多、較平時驟增數倍、致連日批發莊對於各檔羽綢·直貢·嗶嘰·印花貨絨貨色布銷售大旺、各廠花色貨允為堅俏、不敷需求、白貨細布細斜粗布本街及內地帮走勢續盛、市盤非常穩固、</p>
<h3>本街呢絨盛極一時</h3>
<p>呢絨銷路、日來可謂八方齊動、東西舶來品及國產毛貨、統有大宗成交、羽紗呢·元常嗶嘰·華特呢·三元光景薄花呢等、成交允夥、袖裏洋布、法西寸、黑炭襯、寬緊條素駱駝絨等、巿銷均盛、帽作塲、大衣作塲、門莊舖子西服帮、俱有進意、銀根略裕號家、仍在四出搜羅洋行現貨、洋行亦知　來呢絨市面進展、貨價升高、大多數因之亦不肯輕易出售矣、</p>
<h3>糧食　津帮昨進現粉四五萬包　標粉漲後仍疲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈初穩繼疲之象、以洋麥無報價、人心本少依據、惟開價時、因津帮有現貨交易、吃進兵船四五萬包、價一角六分惟係廠方划貨、非市塲抽買、不過因此之故、本月份開盤、會見一度熱奮、回好八分半、十·十一月份亦帶好一分零、十二月份以下、則無生色、迫至下午開盤、趨勢又疲、因現貨日積日盛、銷則不敵、一部分廠方、遂有套售、市勢遂又疲軟、較上午高盤、回落一二分不等、據業中人觀察、如往後無大批銷塲、近期粉恐須軋多云、</p>
<h3>期麥交易淸淡　—午後隨粉市下落—</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、各月份大致平穩、因洋麥無市、內地客戶之進出、目下又多觀望、如以米值比較、麥市實難振奮、惟出新已過、多數貨品、已在糧商囤戶手中、非至擯無可擯、不願脫售、是以交易轉淡、上落無幾、迨至下午開盤、以粉市又復不振、買戶見稀、各月份喊價、遂短去二三分左右、此後情形、當以粉銷為轉移耳、現麥市面、高貨穩定、中次平平、開洋河瑤灣麥四元八角八分、蚌埠麥四元八角二分、次七角六分、高郵麥四元七角半、次七角、蔣家壩麥四元七角六分、水溪口麥四元七角、宿遷麥四元八角二分、蕪湖麥四元五角七分、次五角二分、東葛麥四元六角七分、泗州麥四元八角半、東台麥四元八角半、由福新去七千包、申大去一千包云、</p>
<h3>新米出貨日湧　—昨日做開盤價逐跌—</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十七八號、貨共三千六七百石、零銷依然呆滯、包胃大連靑島帮亦僅辦九百餘包、故市况尚難振作、厚早粳價續低幾分至一角、薄稻包胃動者平定、零銷者仍見修削角外、東新粳雖見定勢、然河下較次者又貶幾分、新杜羊尖等價亦相仿、總之新貨在日湧一日之際、難以好望也、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到貨念餘號、市上各貨銷路白粳薄稻、陳羊埠尖平常、新羊團尖短價略交、變元新客尖平淡、市價白粳新埠尖·東新粳定勢、陳羊尖·變元·薄稻·新團尖疲數分、新羊尖價短一二角、新客尖價小近角、昨到崑山新粳十餘石、出品頗佳、開價十元、</p>
<h3>客秈產豐價疲　—滬市昨小二角餘—</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭續有長江各帮湧到、而糙米因月前粵銷活潑、到頭更旺、且巿上存底日漸見充、而近日粵帮去化旣懈、吃價尤緊、行販貨主以產地貨多價落、亦主貶價急脫、故昨日糙米突落二角半至二角不等、機砶各米亦回落五六分至一角許、價跌後消化尙活、粵帮亦有應酬糙米少許、全日開出贛米三千〇二十五包、湘米六千三百包、京糙一百五十八包、漢造一百〇八包、辦胃以本街為主、其他如甬帮汕頭北帮均有點綴云、</p>
<h3>新芝蔴次第上巿　願產地不要攙雜泥灰</h3>
<p>今庚各地新芝蔴比較往歲登塲為早、且年成尚可樂觀、出品亦佳、惟望各產區對於泥灰千萬不可再有攙雜、因今年銷塲、全靠國外去路、故在國際立塲中、務須保持我國農產品之信譽、幸無貪目前小利、致為人所鄙棄也、昨計開沙市新蔴三百包、價為十元零九角、歸德新蔴十八包、價為十元零五角半、南京新蔴三十五包、價為九元六角、宿州新蔴二十包、價為九元一角半、及揚州新蔴五十三包、價為九元三角·九元一角、刻下起勢一因新貨交易、一則洋莊疲軟、所以前途不免見辱、昨洋莊拋盤開四百五十噸、價為十一元八角二分原盤、</p>
<h3>八月份糧價統計（二）</h3>
<h3>絲茶　滬絲云路仍恃用戶</h3>
<p>昨日紐約因勞動節循例休息、因之無市、里昂絲市呆穩如前、　濱方面、因悉今年秋繭歉收（的較上年產量减少百分之十）、故絲價稍形回上、計現貨漲三元、期貨漲十一元、申埠絲市、仍以用戶為校活躍、惟價格仍無起色、昨日普通B字等級、已跌進六〇〇元關、但走銷尚暢、昨日洋行用戶等共購進一百五十八包、</p>
<h3>兩湖紅茶慘跌</h3>
<p>據漢口傳來消息、今庚湘鄂兩省紅茶出產總額、為數共有二十三萬箱、前由英商怡和協和各洋行及蘇聯辦茶機關、購去十餘萬箱、市面尚稱良好、最近因印度錫蘭茶廉價競銷、該路茶大受打擊、近兩週來、銷路一　不振、存底囤積至八萬箱、紅茶市價、慘跌至二十一二元、花香跌至十元左右、市情至為不利云、</p>
<p>據茶業公會報告云、綠茶市上週曾有一番走銷、本週略靜、前昨兩日、僅　隆進遂珍三百餘箱、價五十元及五十一元、協和略進抽珍及小針眉、又同孚福時均各有少數屯珍成交、並聞　隆對屯珍的有二百餘箱談盤、日內亦可成交、平水茶正式大帮仍然靜寂、惟錦隆對拆　續有成交云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新紅棗桂圓俱有到滬　桂圓行多了一家——寳大</h3>
<p>首批新鷄心紅棗，昨由鎮帮號家運到三百餘包、當已見樣、貨品尚佳、正在談價中故未開出、新桂圓昨由太原輪入口、續到二批、同安漳州安海等貨一千三百餘件、大的今明日可以見樣、開價不致有上落趨勢、又同業訊、昨有金融界人與某桂圓行新組一寶大桂圓行、經理為袁春發君、並已加入同業公會、即日營業云、</p>
<h3>糖巿　轉口新荷赤昨有劃出</h3>
<p>昨糖市無甚更動、公會劃盤、如二四粗白以四八九號東白等均呌原價、本廠綿白一號仍為二十元半、惟前日新到之新荷赤八九號昨劃過六元零五分、號盤穩立、均少開出、聞行方有向汕頭續辦潮靑之說、故後市似不易看鬆、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳藴素）</p>
<p>做大學教授的人，住往憧憬着大學校長的尊嚴；到了大學校長的頭銜加到身上，又立刻想過一次教育部長的癮；及至教育部長的印抓到手裏，再也不念及舊日的生涯了。這呌什麽呢？前者謂之得隴望蜀，後者謂之樂不思蜀，二者都要不得的啊！</p>
<p>爬在塔頂上的朋友，應該看看下面那些迷途的羔羊，設法指點他們的途徑，呌他們也有拾級而上的可能。</p>
<p>有人說目下填鴨式的教育，並不是當局為學生的學問能充實，將來有出路，完全是應付會考，抽考，上司褒獎的，這好比喂鴨子的人，目的並不在鴨子本身的肥美，是在吃鴨肉的那些老饕啊！</p>
<p>做事好像吃點心，點心要揀我所喜愛的，做事要揀我性之所近的，這樣吃下去才合脾胃，做下去才有意思。不然，身體一定不會舒適的，事業不會有進展的。</p>
<h3>辦校哲學</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>這裏所說的「校」是私立學校。辦私立學校與辦省立學校異。經費來源不同，招生方法不同，這是最顯著的兩大點；因此，辦私立學校是別有秘訣了。</p>
<p>如果把學校比做商店，那末學生就是主顧，。劃一不二的私立學校，固未嘗沒有；然而大簾價招生的，也到處可見。所謂「大廉價」，並非把學費减低之謂；乃是來者不拒，一概錄取，這是吸收通貨之妙法。</p>
<p>主顧進門後，自不能輕易放他出去，所以也不可不知拉攏之法。拉攏之法維何？管理不妨從寬，功課何必認眞是。某校當局—不，老闆—嘗發表他的治校方針，謂：學生越多越好，留級越少越好。這確是深得其中三昧之談。至於校譽，自然也要顧到；因此，某校老闆又績發明先寬後緊之法，卽前幾學期儘可讓學生馬虎地過去，以便吸收通貨，至最後一學期，則對學生突然加緊；汰蕪存精，自然應付會考，個個「派司」，而校譽也不患不蒸蒸日上了。</p>
<p>督學光臨，雖不是玩的事；然而也無妨。平時校內多種花木，臨時把各處牆壁粉刷一新，再令學生嚴守秩序；自然督學先生得心曠神怡之感，或者事後可博得傳令嘉獎，全校都笑逐顏開哩。</p>
<p>私立學校老闆要想保存飯碗，也有秘訣，即：當校董會三顧聘請之時，與其受寵若驚，不如略搭架子。略搭架子，可多訂幾年合同。多訂幾年合同，不是可以作威作福，視學校如私產嗎！</p>
<h3>情侶</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>古代的女子，以深居簡出為美德，現代的女子，以善於和男子交際為摩登。所以昔日雖男女同行，也總是一前一後，二者之間，相距着三五尺，現在呢，男女同行，都是左胳膊絡着右胳膊，相依相偎着，一股親熱的樣兒，是儘也不避眼生人的。衛道之士，對於這種反男女授受不親的摩登行為，視作為世風日下，可是摩登的士女們，却自命為是「情侶」。</p>
<p>在暑期中，是情侶們最活躍的時期，偶然踏進公園去，在林子裏，在小池邊，在甚麼所在，都擠滿着一對對，一雙雙的男女，那便是情侶。在游泳池和海濱浴塲裏的池子邊，沙灘上，彩綢陽傘的下面，都擠滿着一對對，一雙雙男女，那自然也是情侶。在備有冷氣設備的電影院裏，在最後的幾排座位上，擠滿着一對對，一雙雙的男女，在電影放映着的黑暗的空間中，娓娓地細語着，謔浪地笑着，那便是情侶。在不供應舞女的高等舞塲中，在幽綠的燈光下，儕滿着一對對，一雙雙的男女，臉兒相偎，胸兒相貼，足尖兒對着足尖兒，步着樂調而舞着，其間也儘有不少是情侶。在晚飯後的黃昏中，在高挺的法國梧桐下的人行道上，在習習的凉風裏，在一壁說着，一壁笑着，一壁互挽着胳膊兒，緩緩地在散步的情侶，是更多了。「情侶」，竟成了大都市中，最富有詩意一個點綴品。</p>
<p>若說結婚是戀愛的墳墓，那麼！我想情侶時期，該算是戀愛的蓓蕾。在一對對，一雙雙的情侶的臉上，是充滿着天眞而無邪的笑意。心田中的熱情，奔放而流露在情侶們的嘴角上。大家都忘了愛情之外的一切，忘了人世問的一切悲哀與痛苦。每一情侶所感到的，都是我的心中，只有一個你，你的心中，只有一個我」。</p>
<p>但是，天下無不開放的蓓蕾，所以天下的情侶也一大半都以結婚作結束。還有一小半，便受暴風雨的外力所打擊而摧殘。結婚，是戀愛的墳墓，被暴風雨所摧殘的蓓蕾，更是不免於一個悲慘的結局，因此，我祝福着所見的一對對，一雙雙情侶，多多地體味着你們情侶，時期中的甜蜜蜜的滋味。—情侶時期，實是你們一生戀愛生活的黃金時期。牢牢地抓住着罷，莫放它輕輕地逃掉。</p>
<h3>和尚豆</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>我們江浙一帶，對於豆，似乎也是一種消開的食料，因炒燉煨煮的不同，便產生出多種各別的名稱與滋味來，如鬆而脆的沙炒豆，甜而香的五香豆，鹹而硬的炒鹽豆等等，但最給人們所歡迎的，却是酥軟嫩膩的和尚豆。</p>
<p>據說和尚豆是蘇東坡創製的，用青豆剝去皮的一頭，置在水中浸胖，加以鹹料同燉，祗一飯時便熟透，下酒佐餐，入口卽融，而且和西瓜子落花生一般，大有百吃不厭，欲罷不能之概，五香豆，沙炒豆，雖也別具風味，但總多一種彈力，多一種抵抗性，可是它雖然能得到食者的歡迎，但祇是犧牲了自己，以供人咀嚼的一個弱者而已！</p>
<p>假若以和尚一豆而象徵着我們老大的古國與民族，那麼炒鹽豆大可以比例阿比西尼亞，因為它，究竟多予牙齒以頑抗，一個不留意，便得踅斷牙齦，咬破舌尖，雖然終於給吞了下去，也選留着一些渣滓，一些焦皮屑，嵌在牙縫裏作祟，給與吃者一個老大的不適，就是要染指的時候，手上也得沾上些油膩，和尚豆則不然，祇是伏伏貼貼，在舌尖一雄之下，卽已皮肉消融，屑粒無存，此亦大堪悲哀者也！</p>
<p>可是我們豆早已註定的是豆了，我們但願主持煮製者，多煮些炒鹽豆，別祇是迎合人家的胃口，浸得胖胖的，軟軟的，使人家也可以感到不便利，而知所顧忌才好。</p>

<p>在這個時候，己是晚飯端上了桌子，娘兒倆的話打斷，不再提，夢蘭為了免除母親疑心起見，打起精神來，吃了一碗半飯。飯後，還在母親屋子裏坐了半小時，才回樓上去一次日，恰好是個星期日，自己雖是很願意出去散一散悶，可是身體疲倦，總打不起精神來。因之也就只堆了幾本雜誌在桌上，隨便翻閱着。正看得有點兒趣味，忽然有兩隻手伸了過來，把自己的眼睛遮住。抬起手來，發那兩隻手，只覺軟綿綿均，還有一個戒指，因笑道：我一猜就着，你是李友梅。那人放下手來笑道：你怎麽知道是我？夢蘭站起來笑道：這麽天姑娘，還是這樣淘氣。人長得像薛寶釵，性格又像史湘雲，你是個兩全共美的美人。友梅笑道：你還說人。丟了正經書不念，在家裏只可偷看紅樓夢。說着，他挽了夢蘭一隻手，同在床沿上坐下，夢蘭看他穿了一件淺紅色的　綢夾　，下面繫了一條長長的靑湖續裙子，露出一雙白番布鞋來。在袖口裏露出他那豐潤的肌膚，眞是可愛。也是一張長圓臉兒，大大的眼睛，在兩腮上，透出兩塊紅暈，同那頭上烏油似的頭髮，又得顏色調和之美。他忽然的笑道：你老看我作什麽？夢蘭道：夏天快到了，你脫了衣服越是好看。友梅笑道：你愛看，你就看罷。找聽到伯母說說幾天你很不自在，怎麽你見了我又這樣快活起來呢？夢蘭聽說不由得嘆了一口氣。友梅握住他一隻手道：這樣說，你倒是眞有　不高興了。你為了什麽事？夢蘭道：無從說起。說着搖了兩搖頭，友梅道：我們這樣好的朋友，你有什麽心事不應當瞞了我。我這人最喜歡多事，說不定你感到困難的事，恰好只有我能帶忙。夢蘭聽到這話，不由得突然站了起來，向他臉上望着道：什麽，你能帮我的忙？你怎麽帮我的忙？他說着這括時，臉上可就紅了。那紅暈起得很猛，好像並不屬於害羞方面。友梅道：你還沒有說出來為了什麼困難呢，我怎能說替你帮忙的話。夢蘭道：因為你說，恰好你可以帮忙，我就疑心你知道我什麽困難。友梅笑道：那是你誤會了我的意思了。我以為你的事，也許用得着我的。夢蘭對於這話，就不再下提了。他在桌邊椅子上坐下，用手托了頭，微微的歡了一口氣。（七二）</p>
<h3>國軍大刀隊與舊京王麻子老店（下）</h3>
<p>— 病鴛</p>
<p>嘗聞一軍事專家言：謂吾國各軍中之大力隊，在昔常推馮煥章將軍統率之西北軍中所附屬者，其訓練與技術，及作戰實力，皆應首屈一指。蓋其隊士悉選軍中精壯，取個別教練，且人人皆諳國術，技擊深湛，卽徒手與人角，往　集十餘壯丁之力，等閒不得近其身，隊士所用之刀，一律係續鋼治製，背厚面狹而鋒薄，雖未必如說部中所謂俠士之寶刀，可以吹毛斷髮，削鐵斬釘，然而用之砍人頭，卸人臂，再配以隊士施展之功夫，則信猶之切菜破瓜也。</p>
<p>至刀之來源，並非取諸國有機關之兵工廠中，乃為舊京土麻子鐵器舖所造。按該　舖在故都種王家老店，亦有人經呼為王麻子鐵店，開設於東四牌樓，迄今已有四百餘年之歷史，世以製造刀槍劍戟十八般舊兵器而馳譽於國術界。相傳至該店第三代主人，是卽王麻子，共人麻，幼年喜弄刀槍棍棒，後承名師之傳，得少林正宗之刀法。王賦性沉默，不茍言笑，遇不平事，必挺身而出，尤重義信諾，無論職與不職，有急難乞援，糜不應。其始祖係前明之遺民，初非出身匠人，頗富資財，開設是店，志不在牟利，殆另有深意存焉。惟其出貨精良，取價低廉，營業大盛，獲利反豐。王麻子繼承先業，凡百悉循舊規，獨於冶造　刀，格外研究，精益求精。每遇奇人俠士來購，必不惜工本，竭盡技非，為之鼓鑄。有時與客論交，竟不肯受值，久之，其資財漸耗殆盡，僅賴營業，維特店務，否則，王麻子早成屢人矣。在前淸開國百齡年後，舊京社會，鮮有不知東四王掌櫃其人。蓋其好義輕財，馳聲遐邇，後又成為技繫名家，交游益廣。顧其外貌恂恂然，頗不類拳師，更不類鐵匠。或曰：工之子，始為工，彼祖若父，本亦讀書種子，若王麻子則大隱淪於市井，初未容因其操業而鄙賤之。王於晚年，忽有心得，每當開鑪冶鐵，必在原　中配合一種物質，幾經煉製，而後取以造器。器中尤以刀最著名，蓋刀為武術家所用極普遍之物，王本人所擅長者亦為刀法；因之每一刀成，其質至堅，其鋒至利，用之者無不得心應手，　非凡品。所惜我國禎習，每有發明，但期獨得其秘，絕對不肯公開，子孫賢者尚能繼續，不肖者遂失其眞傳，天下憾事，甯有愈於此者乎？至王麻子鑄刀之法，其大體今仍存在，尚不至面目全非，但其後人，不知乃祖畢生心血之可寶，祇知趨向於偷工减料之營業化。久之，其獨得之秘竅，亦將漸歸烏有矣。有人謂王麻子昔所造刀，其中摻有赤金若于成，金質至堅，言亦成理。故在從前出品，凡屬自稱為寶刀者，造時必經百日以上，所費亦過千串，其工繁，其本鉅，其價值可知，稱曰寶刀，殆不謬矣。</p>
<p>前清刑部劊子手所用斬决囚犯之刀，亦由王家老店所承造，民國以還，華北各軍中大刀隊所用刀，因慕其名，多責令製造。在當時鞏縣與德州兩兵工廠所鑄之大刀，亦確不及其「堅」「巧」「經」「快」。最近國軍中之大刀隊，魯省有韓復榘部，冀省有宋哲元部，不特全隊咸稱勇士，卽各個隊士之國術，亦復非常。考其歷史，則仍屬諸舊西北軍嬗遞補充之遺耳。至宋部即會在喜峯口苦戰之第二十九軍是也。</p>

<h3>沒落後的誇耀</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>小唐沒落了，自從他父親投機事業失敗後，他就失掉了一座金錢的靠山。朋方們都親眼看他從崇高華麗的享樂之塔巔跌落下來，沒埋於污泥般的生活中，一蹶而不振。於是引起朋友們一番嘆息與批評，有的說他有綫時太荒唐了，有的說他以前太看輕金錢了，雖然這點批評的人，從前正是他荒唐揮耗的助手，擁護他向沒落之路上跑的人，現在是翻過臉來了</p>
<p>在第三者或許要感歡着人情世態，但在小唐自己，倒滿不在乎這一點，他偶然在夜花園的籬笆邊瞥見他兩年前的『知己』，從汽車裏挽着女人出來，走進門去，他感到欣慰似的想：『結交的朋友畢竟得發了，可是他為什麽不來看我呢？哦，我自己眞昏了，父親的住宅不是被拍賣了嗎嗎？……東走西走，沒有一定歸宿，呌他那裏來找我？』他奔前去想喊他，不料腦袋上着了司開捕一棍。</p>
<p>小唐這才氣惱了，他退到籬笆邊的暗角裏，他對司閣捕瞪瞪眼睛，駡道：『沒生眼珠的東西，從前替我開汽車門忘掉了嗎，唐三少，你不認識唐三少嗎，我那輛司蒂倍克你是每夜看熟的，你胆敢打，侮辱，那位朋友的叔父就是律師……』駡到這裏停止了，小唐有了新的見解：『僥倖沒有喊住那朋友，自己身面不像樣，他有女人在旁邊，那太難為他了，知己朋友就不應該……』</p>
<p>他告訴另一個夥伴，說他的朋友都是那樣闊綽的。</p>
<p>在街沿上拾到一個烟蒂，貼上嘴唇，他辨出是什麼牌子，他又告訴他的夥伴，對於吸烟捲，他很有經騐，從前他吸這牌子，每天須兩聽，一半是請客，那時吸掉半支就丟了。現在，現在，正是「沙灘蛟龍」，哼！有朝一日……然而腸胃却不服小唐的誇耀，而搗亂起來，而呌喊起來，這一下小唐沒法，扮起苦險來，『先生，太太，可憐我吧……』向人求乞。</p>

<h3>萬眾所求的有效戒煙法</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>煙毒一入身體，則血液內被其刺戟而生無數的『血小板』，此種『血小板』能促進各細這活力，故一旦停止吸煙，血液中的『血小板』無從刺激，各細胞失去其依賴不能活動，身體遂大感不適，甚至不能支持，陷於萬分痛苦之中，吸煙過久者，被麻醉的程度愈深，故平時身體的衰弱亦愈甚，雖設法戒除，必至半途而廢，不能竟其全功，所以最安全的戒煙方法，捨培補戒煙法之外，沒有再較好的了。蓋培補戒煙法，一面可將煙毒减轻，同時即產生一種滋補力量，以前被雅片所侵害的各部，就馬上恢復原狀，故經過絕無痛苦，下列的一戒者，係用此法，得以戒除其十四年的煙癮，費時衹月許，可謂方法安全。效果確實矣。</p>
<p>患者鄒來儀，浙之杭州人，現年四十歲，念六時即染上煙癮，加之身體素弱，故煙量頓增，每日至少吸煙六錢，以前鄒君所擁有之遺產，因十四年之取給無力度，家道遂漸形衰微，經濟能不許其吸煙，在前年曾戒煙一次，因戒時病變百出，故中途復吸，今春得同族某之介紹，用培補戒煙法，服以『生殖素』以增加血液中之抗毒素，並注射『育維賜保命』以縮短戒期，减少痛苦，在開始服『生殖素』第一週，即减烟量四分之一，約四星期左右，吸烟不到一錢，共服『生殖素』月許，竟將十四年之老癮戒絕一旦，刻精神壯健，體重增加，面色轉有紅潤。</p>
<p>淋濁自療</p>
<h3>白濁的自療良法</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>娼妓是花柳病傳染的總樞紐，所以喜歡冶遊的人們，很容易發生白濁，原因由於娼妓的陰道不潔，陰道內的淋病雙球菌藉此機會侵入到你的尿道，故一度不潔的交媾後，使你的龜頭種脹，排尿刺痛，白色粘液，糊滿尿道前端，而淋漓不息。萬一不慎，即傳染妻子，如淋濁過久，精囊大受損害，就有喪失生育的危險，本症的唯一治療方法，除服以黃色素和伐克辛合製劑『安敵淋』之外，實無再較簡效也。因黃色素有透膜殺菌之效，而伐克菌能使體內增加抵抗毒素的能力，不論慢性與急性，都為對症的良藥。</p>
<p>患者林順才，蘇州木凟鎮人，彼患白濁已有兩載，當之妝因治療不慎，致由急性而變慢性，中間雖服藥多種，仍然無效，有時服後雖感覺表面痊癒，但未到幾月，重竹復發作，如是反覆延誤，病毒愈深，今春由同事的介紹服以『安敵淋』之後，病象轉佳，白濁淨止，約服四盒，完全根治痊可，尿液澄清，刻已治癒四月，雖操勞過度，刻步行過遠，亦不若前之再發矣，總計彼共受白濁之苦兩載，精神及肉體痛苦之外，尚受金錢之損失，今者此種痛苦完全解除，足證『安敵淋』的神效偉大也。</p>
<p>自療常識</p>
<h3>如何能使遺精的青年得救</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>手淫雖不是傳染性的病症，然而羅患的青年倒反而層出不窮，差不多到了十五六歲的時期，都要想來嘗試一下，不過少接的觸淫畫，比較可以避免些。</p>
<p>手淫之害，在今日的公開討論下，已經證實能促成神經衰弱症與發育不全，因為手淫之後，生理上所生的精液，必定要流出若干，而且染上這種惡癖之後，雖然明知要斵喪身體，摧殘精關，然而終究敵不上生理的刺激，情愿做一只飛蛾而投入火焰而不自覺，這是多麼傷必的事喲？</p>
<p>遺精一症，多數是根據手淫而發生的，神經衰弱症是根據遺精後而促成的，所以有手淫癖的青年，他的精關定然鬆懈，比較厲害些，差不都一月之內，至少要夢遺十次以上，試想，這樣的青年，康健當然成為困難的問題了。</p>
<p>神經衰弱症，種類不一，舉凡是，精神萎頓，頭昏腦脹，耳鳴，心悸，失眠，盜汗，記憶力薄弱，記銘力衰退等，都謂之神經衰弱症。</p>
<p>近來畫報雜誌上，及通俗衛生書籍上，多有本症治療法的討論，大都以停止手淫為其唯一的內容。誠然，遺精的治療，雖然必須痛戒手淫。試問，手淫停止後，業關及全身被遺精所破壞的種種，是否可以自動恢復？當然不可能的事，所以本文的討論點，為求更進一步的貢獻，將遺精及神經衰弱症的療法，作實際有效的指導。所以凡是有遺精症的人，不論是屬於身體虛弱而遺精，不論是純由手淫摧殘而發生，第一必須鞏固精關，使精關鞏固之後，神志堅定，夢遺可免，故應以『希米脫氏固精片』治其遺精，同時宜服『生殖素』以消減神經衰弱症，這樣補救，對於病人是有不少的利益，今特舉述如下：（一）因效果迅速，療期縮短，對於時間上有不少的利益（二）服法簡便，費用減省，頗合於經濟之道，對於經濟困難者大有裨益，（三）藥力偉大，各著名醫師多肯為之介紹證明，以免病家有猶豫不决之苦。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>血分不潔與瘋濕骨痛的治愈</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>骨痛一症、在人們心目中，都有些見它搖頭，的確骨痛的發作，實在有些心驚肉跳，而且它不但使你的肉體受苦，精神也未嘗不使你狼狽，</p>
<p>當發作比較厲害的，竟可使你全身行動陷於不遂，形同中風，在年歲稍高的，罹患率非常增高，差不多要佔十分之九以上，所以年老人幾盡為骨痛所苦。</p>
<p>骨痛何以會發生呢？除了早年的荒淫和血份不潔之外，厥為瘋濕及操勞過度了。</p>
<p>患者荘石岩，年四十九歲，浙江長興人，住居於本埠老垃圾橋北堍東唐家弄裕慶里，廿四歲時，即開始實行其浪漫的性生活，以致血液不潔，加這職業過勞，僕僕長途，胃盡風霜，故瘋濕內蘊，年青時因抵抗力稍强，隱伏而不發，在中年時，始乘機惡化，起先衹覺工作後腰背酸痛而已，至四十四歲時，每交節氣，即感全身麻木，兩肩膀酸痛難當，上年冬病愈劇烈，竟陷於半身不遂，而腰背酸痛之苦，幾為日常所不能免，後幸為同鄉羅君的介紹，服以『强斯登氏骨痛片』之後，病乃轉佳，連服兩月，腰背爽適，骨節輕鬆，至今年有餘，從未一發云。</p>
<h3>奠定曲線美的發育乳峯</h3>
<p>— 王士英</p>
<p>二十世紀的審美觀念，完全根據在健康的基礎上了。所以女子一反從前的弱不禁風，而必須要壯健丰腴，發育美滿。講到發育，我們就曉得很與健康有連繫關係，因為發育不全，身體當然衰弱，特別在女子，當發育之年，如有良好的成績，則乳峯高聳，臀部丰滿，腿臂壯健，不但曲線畢露，而疾病也就减少了。所以女子一生的康健幸福，衹須打量她的乳房發育，就不難猜想而知了。</p>
<p>而且女子乳房發育美滿，婚後妊娠的機能强大，乳汁也不慮缺少，滋養也豐富異常，結果對於胎兒大有裨益。試想，這是多麼重要的一件事，實在不容我們再來忽視了。</p>
<p>誠然，乳峯高聳，確實是增加美姿，但是僅僅增加幾分姿色，我想到也在其次了，特別其能使全身的體力强壯，抵抗力强大。所以能致力於乳房發育的女子，她確實是研究「健美」的成功者，不過身體衰弱的，生殖腺也就萎縮，所以乳房萎癟，不能膨脹高聳，此時唯一的補救，應以真正純良的女性生殖腺素製劑「女用生殖素」服之，使體內的內分泌增加，新陳代謝的能力旺盛，結果乳房的發育豐腴美滿，而曲線美的基礎，始得奠定。使妳永無遺憾！</p>
<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌著</p>
<h3>夫婦的病弱與絕嗣之補救</h3>
<p>夫婦雙方有了健全的體格，纔能够組織幸福的家庭，這是任何人盡知的事實，無需我們再來瑣屑了。不過我們站在醫學的立塲上，應該將康健的方法，作公開指導的必要。</p>
<p>從古至今，人類由生而死，皆痛惜個人的死亡，但是身體衰弱的，一定多病多痛而容易夭逝，所以任何人皆希望有康健的願望，不惜用許多金錢，覓求長壽的方法。又有人搜集，人參鹿茸何首烏等貴重藥品，然而其效幾何？</p>
<p>現代學者奧國生理學家司丹那氏，取羊與兎的睪丸，移植在軟弱動物的身上，就產生內分泌的作用，能致返老還童，所以他就根據這一點，提取雄壯動物的生殖腺素制鬚眉「生殖素」，服後能使人體的生殖腺旺盛，白血球與赤血球增加，不論他是先天不足，後天失調，或者婚後性生活過度，致行高度的神經衰弱症，都可藉「生殖素」以補救之，我們在臨診時確藉它偉大的藥力，從未遭遇失敗。</p>
<p>每有在婚前體質强壯的，結婚後就肌肉削瘦，身體衰弱不堪，甚至不能行夫婦之道，或婚後數年，即感覺面色蒼白，未老先衰，此進唯一的補救，衹有服「生殖素」以旺盛其生殖腺，增加其血液，此為最高全合理的根本對策。歷試不爽！</p>
<p>此外，婦女的妊娠問題，亦必須藉女用「生殖素」來調整月經，因為當精子流入子宮，如子宮內膜在月經前後充血，如能適當調整，則受精卵即附於粘膜上，漸次發育成胎兒，這才是受孕的理由，「生殖素」能助長婦女的排卵機能，因為女性若不排卵，任憑數百萬精子一齊突進，也無濟於事。是故不孕的婦女，或身體衰弱與月經不調等，餌服「女用生殖素」後，在短期內，即可澈底根治。</p>
<p>不過生育是男女雙方平衡負責的，男子如體質衰弱，發育不全，當然沒有健全的精子產生，所以要避免絕嗣的煩惱，和生育的希望成為事實，必定雙方共同服用此項「生殖素」，發明人為了要達到男女一無遺憾，所以製成男用與女用兩種，現在各國在獎勵生育，所以該藥愈能風行全球了。</p>

<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息</p>
<p>（一）遺精滑精的治療</p>
<p>患者張海生，年廿一歲，浦東人，住居於本埠天濟路鑫順里七號，職業電料跑街。十八歲時開始手淫，致起神經衰弱症。（主訴）——手淫四年，雖知手淫之害，但為慾望所驅不能戒絕，今年正月起，生殖器愈見過敏，以前雖感靈敏，但尚未至極度，現則稍加刺戟立即勃起，頗以為苦，遺精滑精，疲勞，頭痛，思想力减退，入夜盜汗，精神異常不振，夢遺頻繁，（病歷）——在校時已知有手淫其事，不過尚未試行，旋看淫書，必乃躍躍欲試，民國廿年春受外界之引誘，始實行手淫，久習成慣，乃行之頻繁。（現在症狀）——目倦無神，所患之神經衰弱症甚烈，全身營養障碍，精關松懈，肌肉削瘦，體重衹八十八磅，（治療方法）——戒除手淫，每日電療一次，並為之冷却後尿道部，攝護腺按摩，以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』滋補其體虧，消減其神經衰弱症，同時再以『希米脫氏固精片』根治其遺精，鞏固其精關，精關旣固，精神自足，神志也隨之鎮定，夜夢减少，不到六星期完全治愈，不便精神充足，而肌肉亦結實異常，食慾增進，體重增至一百〇八磅矣。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>世界和平大會</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>據六日比京電，世界和平運動大會，昨日賡續開會，自經各名人演說之後，旋卽通過宣言書，結束會務。其宣言的最重要語句，謂此項運動之唯一目的，厥在全世界民族，無分强弱，均在完全平等之條伴下，共享和平之樂，苟有一國焉，違反國際法，而從事侵略，因而破壞世界和平，則我人當以唯一敵人靦之云云。這幾句話，何等好看，亦是好聽，尤其是一般弱小民族聞之，更加開味，更加點頭稱是，更要大拍共掌。</p>
<p>但是回轉頭來看看，所謂希望和平保障和平的東西，着實不少，如國聯盟的，如九國公約，如羅卡諾條約，如縮减軍備會議，試問此種紙上空談，也是收過保障和平的實效者乎？此種堂皇而冠冕的條文，早已成為廢紙，為侵略者踐踏殆盡，撕廢殆盡，還欲開此和平大會乎。</p>
<p>已過的事情不算，且再來看看現在，德國大造坦克車，現有坦克車隊三師，將來擬增編八師，并且念念不忘收回舊殖民地，美决定援英先例，保留驅逐艦四萬噸，强化商船隊，日本備戰積極，擴充航空教育；英國增募新兵兩萬四千名；法國延長兵役時期；俄國縮减兵役年齡；這種現狀擺在眼前，試問這樣和平的喊聲，他們還聽得見麽？</p>
<p>一個人病重，馬上去請女巫，去請拆字，去請太保做鬼戲，但是結果，一點不能收效。世界有一部份的國家，看見世界形勢不好，二次大戰卽在目前，馬上發起和平大會，來反對戰爭，其結果和請女巫拆字太保等。中元節後，各處舉行盂蘭大會，蘄求一里一鄉太平，保佑不生疾病，和平大會的效能，其結果和盂蘭大會相同，這眞是無聊之極矣。</p>
<p>我國人迷信，外人未見不迷信，試看現在的和平大會，竟與我國的迎神賽會相同，是何故歟？亦是人窮呼天的一個道理。其實愈呼和平，而愈不和平，因為現在的世界，原是一個弱肉强食的世界，祇有槍對槍，砲對砲，飛機對飛機，殺得一個鬼哭神號，拚一個你死我活，方才罷手，假定呼籲和平，祈禱和平，一般侵略者流，卽視為畏怯，視為怕死，視為有隙可乘，眞所謂長他入的志氣，滅自己的威風，而魔鬼之手，更將伸長而攫取矣。</p>
<p>故現在的世界，惟戰爭乃可以制止戰爭，惟殺戮乃可以制止殺戮，惟强權乃可以制止强權，故欲以和平之手段，希望和平，其和平終不可得，其和平更屬危險，世之專以和平為手段，以息事寧人為目的者，其亦可以思其故矣。</p>
<h3>老闆娘的故事（續）</h3>
<p>— 以一</p>
<p>我便把我看出了老闆娘的那副愁苦的面容告訴他，他便張大了脫落了三顆牙齒的嘴哈哈的笑了。——你那里曉得？你號里……他的笑語聲被劇烈的咳嗽聲吞沒了。</p>
<p>——大概是三年前吧，老車夫定了定神之後說了。那老闆娘的男人死掉了，店里的事情就全是她一人來照管了。可是年紀靑靑的女人，模樣又挺那個的，又是剛死了男人，……你想想，來來往往的生意人多着吶，日子長了，誰都要說幾句玩話逗她，哼，沒有多少日子另一個趕車夫便悄悄地告訴我關於她的秘密了——她給一個住在店里的賣土綢的販子勾搭上了，他還說了些什麼親眼目覩的話。本來我不相信的，後來她給那綢販子的親暱樣兒也給我看出來了。</p>
<p>這里邊就出了毛病了，那個趕車夫年紀輕輕的不是個好傢伙，不知道他用了什麼手段也把那老闆娘弄上手了，這當然免不了爭風吃醋了。一天晚上那個混蛋的車夫把那綢販騙到山谷里去用石塊把他打死了————這事情至今也只有我曉得。那麽，那個趕車夫可以吃獨食了，可是人的嘴總是太壞了，你一言，我一語的說些不三不四的閒話，那老闆娘便只有裝做聽不見算完，赶車夫那傢伙可受不了哩，有很多人大概也是為了吃醋關係吧，就有人要給他打架，終於在一個晚上，他便席捲了老闆娘很多的錢和首飾逃掉了！</p>
<p>老闆娘便掉在痛苦的深淵里了，一直到現在……</p>
<p>——她年紀不還是很輕的嗎？我說：</p>
<p>——我有時候也常向她開開玩笑，她說她恨透男人了，沒良心……。那老趕車夫就又哈哈的笑起來了！</p>
<p>我曉得他是為什麽笑了。</p>
<p>他扭回身去加緊了兩鞭，那馬車便穿過了一個樹林，他又告訴我：</p>
<p>——穿過了樹林，再過一個橋那便是有名的七里堡了，在那里有一所別墅，到那里時我再告訴你一件關於那別墅里的事情。</p>
<p>他沒等我再向他問話。他便又：</p>
<p>「得兒——喔噢！」的打着馬飛快的跑去了。……　（完）</p>
<h3>秋蚊的教訓</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>夏天有兩種最討厭而可怕的東西，是蒼蠅和蚊蟲。這兩種小動物產生在齷齪的地方，繁殖極速。在鄉下時候，看着一臭水浜的孓孑不多幾天都變成了生着翅膀飛來咬人的蚊蟲了，蒼蠅據說是生卵的，我沒有親眼看過它們的蛻化，但是它們成羣結隊的到處亂飛亂撞，它的繁殖力總也不下於蚊蟲吧。鄉下人是最不講究衛生的，有什麽學生到廣塲上來宣揚捕蠅捕蚊的時侯，小孩子雖然會圍着去瞧熱鬧，老年人却嚕咕起來：</p>
<p>「什麽衛生不衛生，我們也活到這一把年紀了，讀了書就會讀出這些花樣來。」</p>
<p>那時候自已剛在小學里讀教科書，也知道一點蒼蠅和蚊蟲的厲害，不過大人們旣不相信這些鬼話，我們這一點剛學來的常識自然無用武之地了。</p>
<p>現在是住在大都市里丁，衛生常識也與年俱進。卽是不到鄉下去宣傳衛生之道，也不致馬馬虎虎放那些害人的蚊蠅過門。一到夏令，我家里就有兩樣必需品，蒼蠅拍和蚊烟香。</p>
<p>但是這些小動物一到都市來，也學乖了，蒼蠅不是一羣羣的亂飛亂撞，它們是採取散兵錢式的，祇要你不留意的時候，它們像飛機孵蛋似的在菜餚上稍縱卽逝，蒼蠅拍是無濟於事的。蚊蟲呢，祇聽見它們嗡嗡之聲，可了你一口已經不見它的影子。一點起蚊烟香，却連嗡嗡之聲都沒有了。</p>
<p>立秋之後，情形又是一變。在鄉下這些東西已經是絕跡的時侯了，它們享受了一個夏節，現在都僵化了，不必蒼蠅拍和蚊烟香使威，它們自會跌倒在桌子上或是什麽地方死去了。而都市中剛是亂霍瘧疾發生的時候，這實在是使人想不透的。</p>
<p>昨天晚上在燈下看書，一個蚊蟲在我手臂旁飛來飛去，彷彿一頭盤旋在天空的鷹一樣，它在搜覓它的目的物，於是我的目光放棄了書本上的黑字跟着它盤旋，想等它停到手臂上時，馬上請它送命。這樣有不少時候，它漸漸飛近我的手臂了，但是在一剎間我的皮肉上已着了一口，而那只蚊蟲不知飛到什麼地方去了。那被咬的手臂，立刻顯現一個紅塊，奇癢，我馬上用花露水搽了，索性不看書，靜等它第二次飛來，但是到我眼皮抬不起來的時候還是使我失望。今天早上醒來，大腿上同樣發現了四五個紅塊，這自然又是它的襲擊。</p>
<p>這給了我一個很大的教訓，「衛生之道」不能在看見蒼蠅蚊蟲多起來的時侯才衛生的，我們要隨時隨地衛生着到它們絕了跡，那末明年或許可以少受些苦。說得更明白一點，我們不怕它們成羣結隊地飛來，要留意它們偷偷地襲擊。</p>

<h3>蛇與窮人</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>長脚老四這傢伙最歡喜談蛇，似乎他對於蛇特別見識得多。只要候空？一開口便兩三個時辰談下去，什麽菜靑蛇呵，火赤練呵，烏風蛇呵，還有什麽兩頭的，四脚的，在他嘴裏活現起來。</p>
<p>我是最怕蛇的，然而很喜歡聽人講述蛇的故事，更常想看看希奇古怪的蛇的面貌。譬如兩頭蛇，我就從未見過，一條細長的蛇身生出兩個頭，四粒小圓眼珠射出光彩，兩張有毒牙的嘴，兩支血紅的舐舌，這將是多麽可怕的形狀呵。一條蛇怎會生出兩個頭呢？這嘗經聽長脚老四講過，極其神秘。</p>
<p>那一年秋天，我躭擱在內地一個小鎮上伯父開的油坊裏，長脚老四是鎮上跑班頭信的，一天兩班，要起早摸夜。下午是他頂空閒的時候，不是『躺屍』（睡），便是『賣話』（多說），油坊裏往來信比較多，他就常在這裏落脚，身體往黃豆袋堆上一仰，右脚一蹺，神氣活現的講起來。有一天他講兩頭蛇——『把蛇斬斷後一定要埋起來，不然，凑巧有兩個頭段被烏兒啣在一塊，就會連接起來，變成兩頭蛇，而且還要報仇。』……</p>
<p>這說法顯然太玄妙，我不相信，但是我相信他蛇的確看見得多，他每天要跑四五十里鄉路，而且要過蔓草叢生的山坡。驚蟄過後路上就有蛇出現了。『有一夜』！他常這樣大驚小怪的呌起來：『月光照得很亮，沒帶桅燈，將近塌頭的時候，怕瞧那士地廟邊的荒塚便低着頭走。來啦，橫在路上的像一根紮肉的粗草繩，有意沒意的用脚一踢，呼的一聲，你道是什麼呵？……</p>
<p>『是蛇吧，怎會呼的一聲？』我使着驚疑的眼色。</p>
<p>『……怎麽不是蛇呢，烏風蛇，呼的一聲穿走，身上墨黑。我赤着腳，被牠咬一口，性命穩不保了，烏風蛇的牙齒比砒箱還毒，死在半路鬼都不知道』</p>
<p>『你為什麼不穿鞋子呢？走夜路最要防蛇咬！』</p>
<p>『小先生：窮人哪，那來這許多鞋子，少欠路頭債似的，鐵鞋亦要穿破，我只生了赤脚的命，早遲總要被毒蛇咬死在半路的』。他睞一睞多紅絲的眼睛，右手伸到腦袋後面，當軟枕。打了一個呵欠：『唉，窮人生定走脚的命！』嘆息着。這一來可引起幾個油榨司務的打趣了！</p>
<p>『長脚，你老婆不是會做鞋子的嗎，還會做綉花拖鞋……嘿嘿……』</p>
<p>『好了，好了，少坍我面子吧，有朝一天我阿四得發，瞧她瀾污貨有什麽面孔見我？除非黑夜裏被蛇咬死，我難道就永世不出頭！』於是，以後他沒有話脫，眼睛一貶，睡去了……</p>
<p>——算起來，這已經是五六年前的事。</p>
<p>这次又曾在鎮上伯父油坊裏躭擱了幾天，可一直沒看見長脚阿四，據油榨司務告訴我，他在兩年前害了蛇頭疔，一直沒收功，入瘦得像活鬼，後來汽車路通了，鎮上信也不用他跑，他站不住脚，開了碼頭。於是，在寂寞的午後再沒有談蛇的人。我自己對於蛇，亦不及從前那樣害怕了。在都市裏混了五六年，每天為着生活奔波，在熱鬧的馬路上，看見那些手執活蛇向人家求乞的丐兒，有的甚至把小蛇從鼻子裏鑽進去，打嘴裏游出來，做出種種可怕的樣子，使人家快快給錢。在都市裏，窮人竟利用蛇來掙取生活的源泉。</p>
<p>我默祝着；長脚阿四並未犧牲在蛇的毒齒上。有機會，或者我還會聽到他講述的故事，……然而，這總不免是夢想了吧？</p>
<h3>沒有奶吃的孩子</h3>
<p>— 已而</p>
<p>後房來的那個鄉下婦人，忽然不見了，只留下帶來的孩子在哭。她到這裏是午飯前，一進門，就把孩子放下，和嫂嫂的男人，跟着另一個男人，一道出去了，那末忽忽地。不知道什末時候，她又回來一趁，獨自一個人。可是一會兒，踪影又渺然了。</p>
<p>沒有相識，她在我們這一家，完全是一個生人，除了嫂嫂。因此，她的行踪，一點也引不起旁人的注意。要不是孩子的哭聲，使我們煩厭，大家眞把她忘了。</p>
<p>夜裏孩子哭了一宵。</p>
<p>隔天，看見嫂嫂很忙碌：煮奶糕，喂豆腐漿，洗尿布，把孩子抱出抱進，有時也哼幾聲不入調的催眠曲，彷彿自已就做起母親來。這時我們有議論了：「那個鄕下婦人，究竟是後房的誰？」「她為什末一來了，馬上就不見」「吃奶的孩子，怎末離得開母親呢？」「聽說孩子生下來，才有一個多月呵。」</p>
<p>這一夜—第二夜，孩子哭得更厲害了，幾乎就沒有片刻停息過。「哇哇！哇哇哇！」聲音是那末的凄切，像肚子餓難過，又像為尋不到母親而悲哀。嫂嫂的不入調的催眠曲，又哼起來了。她越是「搖一搖」的唱，孩子越是「哇哇」的哭。</p>
<p>給她們鬧了兩夜，我這時再也忍耐不住了。</p>
<p>「嫂嫂！你們的孩子為什末這樣哭不停？昨晚哭，今晚又是哭。」我用手擊着板壁。</p>
<p>「先生！眞對你不起呵。孩子沒有奶吃，所以一連吵了你們兩夜。」後房的應聲。</p>
<p>「為什末會沒有奶吃呢？她的母親……」</p>
<p>「母親做奶娘去了。」</p>
<p>「哦！」我有些愕然：「那末她自己這個孩子呢？</p>
<p>「孩子嗎？本來想給人，孩子的祖母不肯，就打算另外請入養。」</p>
<p>又是「哇哇哇」「……我的小寶寶」的響了一陣。</p>
<p>「怎末這般麻煩呢？母親給人做奶娘，孩子再吃別人的奶。」我不大相信她的話。</p>
<p>「麻煩是麻煩的，可是家裏窮，也沒有辦法。這樣可以掙一點錢帮家用。」她又接着：「她是我的妹子呢。」</p>
<p>「掙錢？自己的孩子不是還要用奶娘嗎？」</p>
<p>「自然的。不過上海工錢高，十塊錢一個月，鄉下只有兩塊半，便宜得多了。」</p>
<p>「這樣一個月就可以多得七八塊錢了。」</p>
<p>「不止。這裏還有吃有穿，鄉下是寄到奶娘家去，所以也無需供飯食。」</p>
<p>「那孩子可不必帶來好了。」</p>
<p>「這是恐怕東家不當意，誰能保定一就成呢？」</p>
<p>我明白了一切：十塊錢奪去這個孩子的奶，二塊半錢又佔了另一個孩子的奶。</p>
<p>第三夜更是哭。不過因為哭得太疲乏了，像也熟睡了好一會。</p>
<p>天一亮，鄉下有人來領孩子回去了，母親也沒有來看她一看。嫂嫂給她一瓶豆腐漿，是預備孩子在路上吃的，他們去了。</p>
<p>於是我又想起一個問題：鄉下那個給這個孩子做奶娘的母親的孩子，又將給誰去養呢？</p>
<h3>啞子</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>兩個莊稼漢正在河上坡的玉蜀黍田裏鋤地，六月的近午天，是分外燥熱，雖然有一點河風飄來，那麽矮着半個身子向後一步一鋤的，風全給地頭邊的高粱杆遮住了。年輕的一個，把鋤杆拉到這塊地煞尾，便向那軟鬆鬆地土裏一種，把蘆葦織的大草帽子推到腦後，用胳膊抹着額角上的汗水，就向高粱地裏邊走去，年老的仍然不停的鋤，他抬抬頭，看看小伙子又出了地邊，便好大不高興的喊着：</p>
<p>「小丕子你又歇着呵？」</p>
<p>「喝口水。」</p>
<p>在一顆小桑樹下，放着口紅色瓦罐，小伙子剛要蹲下，他就：</p>
<p>「呵，你你……你是幹麽的？」</p>
<p>高粱根下面的豆秧叢裏，爬着一個人，頭髮長得可怕，亂糟糟的遮住臉，那上面粘了許多草末，灰塵，頭髮下，是一條赤光的身子，這時正用雙手捧着罐子在喝水。小伙子有些慌張了，他怕那個睡在地裏的人會死，這是一條人命呵，要報案，要出棺材錢，要給村長送禮，……他倉皇的竄着，走到那汗水淋淋的老人跟前；（未完）</p>

<p>開篇「吟秋」</p>
<p>一年容易又秋風。落葉先看升上桐。飄飄金風秋至早。世間萬物應天工。歐陽修，會作秋聲賦。早驚秋氣入簾隴。王漁洋，詩吟秋柳傳佳話。餘音嫋嫋動秋衷。秋來怕聽那樓頭笛。庾信當年也秋滿胸。玩秋愛看那洞庭月。秋入錢塘月浪衝。秋水伊人懷舊雨。秋風黃葉吊幽蛩。唧唧蟲聲秋作伴。蓴　滋味憶秋菘。我想那，菊傲荷殘還須秋作主。莫管他，秋來秋去太忽忽。不過是，白蘋紅藝秋光裏。畫這擋丹靑，要算是秋功。飄香桂子隨秋訊。東籬下，秋逐酡顏映酒紅。慢道那，雁橫塞外秋風急。慢道那，人倚樓頭秋露濃。姑看那，文人雅士吟秋興。秋月秋華盡可入詩筒。蟋蟀宵征秋不管。哀啼絡緯夜濛濛。就是那，八月十五中秋節。也不過，舉頭遙望咏秋容。就是那，持鱉對菊秋暉照。也不過，秋社文章點綴工。誰有那，堂高簾遠秋難到。想不到，秋在人間却路路通。那秋水為神眉黛好。輕微微，十分秋月也不够照秦宮。師生為愛秋山好。趁此秋凉倒玉峯。眼前秋添詩意。却忘了，秋信催人惱阿儂。我今朝，聊舒秋意當漁笛。秋色深深在此中。不管那，燕去鴻來秋色老。學一學，蘇東坡的秋風黃葉贈詩翁。恨只恨，近來秋意無窮薄。轉覺秋風却厚一重。秋也秋也我就算曲完終。</p>

<h3>「狂歡之夜」初次試片後記</h3>
<p>名導演名言儻論　衆明星虎嚥狼吞</p>
<p>名導演央東山先生編導的諷刺書劇「狂歡之夜」，業經剪接完成，於上星期二上午十時試演於金城大劇院，往觀者泰半是新華的工作人員，和有關係的演員們。經過了整整兩小時的寂靜的嚴肅的窒息後，　都站起身來伸上個倦腰，臉上露出喜孜孜的笑容，他們大家都承認幾個月來的努力，是沒白耗了！但史導演却做了瞌睡的金剛。把右手撐在額上，坐在原位上一動也不動。大家都喊着：「史先生，史先生：東山，怎麼啦？怎麼啦？」他這　懶洋洋地站起來，臉上沒有一絲笑容，這是顯示了他於本片還覺得有不滿意的地方。果然，他第一句就是：「陸先生，我想明大就到蘇州去補外景去！」但條約他也就露出了歡容，招呼大家說：「辛苦了各位小姐先生，這只是枝節方面的不滿意，大部份說來，還是算成功的呢！時候不早哩，上大東吃午飯去吧！歡聚一下。」在到大東去的路上，他就拉着記者發了如下一段議論；他說：「一部影片從開拍以至於完成，導演是煞費苦心的；上演以後能夠寶座不賣座，那是另外一個問題，可以置諸不問，根本生意眼和「藝術眼」，在目下的中國，似乎到成為正比例的時期還遠着！而他人的批評呢，也可置諸不問，根本別人自有別人主觀的見解，所謂智者見智，仁者見仁。但至少在正式上演以前，在自己看來，總要覺得十分滿意才是，這總對得住自己數月來或成年所耗的心血，對得住化了相當代價熱誠而來的觀衆。所以，這就成了我一定不易的主張，而尤其是這部「狂歡之夜」，是我取材於名作家戈果　的　著編製成的，我希望在末次試映時，會沒有一個鏡頭使「我」起厭膩。一他的話說到　　，大衆的腳也就搬上了大東二樓：亂糟糟一陣　桌子，搬椅子之後，我只回答他簡單的幾　說：「現在的觀衆，對於電影知識，確乎是　　了不少，你在你的影片上多用一分力，觀　們也一定會同樣多用一分力去當鑒牠　！不信，但看本片上演以後大家的批評　是哩。一這時時鐘報了一下：各人的肚子，大　　已在唱空城計啦；所以但等萊到，奠不狼吞虎嚥，屠門大嚼，儘你冬瓜盅哩，蠔油牛肉哩，放下了一桌子，只幾秒鐘，便已勁風捲殘雲，　下空碟空碗了。的確這次參加的人員，十九都是「狂歡之夜」裏的共患難的同志，根本　無所用客氣和拘束的，現在且讓記者介紹一下以作本篇的結束吧：計導演史東山，收音陸元亮攝影余省三，主演胡萍，周璇，顧而已，金山，及王為一施超殷秀岑等。</p>

<h3>National Government Orders All Citizens to Perform Military Service; Military Service Law Should Be Promoted Step by Step; Conscription System Cannot Be Delayed Any Longer</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 8th stating that the way to strengthen the country lies first in sufficient troops. In modern times, all countries in the world follow the system of universal conscription. In ancient China, soldiers were integrated with farmers, and the ranks came from the rural community. Later generations exclusively used recruitment, and soldiers and farmers were separated, which has continued to this day without reform. Most people are content with idleness and weakness, and national consciousness is fading. Moreover, the cost of raising troops is enormous, and the state's finances are insufficient to supply them. In the event of a crisis, there are still concerns that the vast territory of the country will not be sufficient for deployment. If we do not train militias in a timely manner and improve the military system, how can we provide garrison troops and strengthen border defenses? The Military Service Law was previously formulated and promulgated, and has been implemented since March 1st of this year. The responsible authorities have now selected various division jurisdictions and should promote the law step by step according to procedure. We hereby issue a sincere order that all citizens must know that performing military service is a duty that everyone should fulfill. At this time of national hardship, there should be a determination to strengthen ourselves. The conscription system is a fundamental plan to strengthen self-defense forces. Other countries have implemented it for a long time, and we must catch up quickly and cannot delay any longer. We must ensure that all people in the country wake up together and work together to implement it. Those who are required to perform military service according to law should especially work hard, enthusiastically enlist, and revive the nation and consolidate the country's foundation. We have great expectations. This order. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, the Customs can only handle anti-smuggling according to precedent. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar General Inspectorate transferred 100 anti-smuggling soldiers from Qikou to listen to commands and conduct anti-smuggling activities in the city. Chen Juesheng and Fu Shan returned to Beiping from Tianjin at 4:00 PM on the 8th. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Wang Kemin arrived in Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 8th aboard the Japanese ship Changping Maru. He docked at the Dalian wharf at 11:15 AM and disembarked at 11:40 AM, escorted by plainclothes detectives and armed guards. He immediately took a car back to his residence at No. 1, Xinhe Lane, No. 23, British Concession Road. He is scheduled to visit Tashiro, Iida, Tajiri, and Togawa at 2:00 PM this afternoon to exchange views. According to reports, he met with Staff Officer Sentada of the North China Garrison and representatives of the Kwantung Army in Dalian but did not meet with Itagaki. It is undecided how long he will stay in Tianjin and whether he will go to Beiping to attend meetings. He came here in response to Song's repeated telegrams urging him to help. He personally has no preconceived notions about whether or not to take office. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Mr. Wang Kemin, who has been appointed chairman of the Economic Committee of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, arrived here today by sea from Dalian. He disembarked under the protection of police detectives and others. Thirty uniformed police officers were present, holding firearms, and armed guards stood on the running boards on both sides of the car Wang was riding in, waiting for him at the wharf. After leaving the wharf, he drove to his residence in the British Concession. When Wang met with reporters, he declined to comment on the current situation and said that he was still undecided whether or not to accept the position of chairman of the Economic Committee. As for when Wang will go to Beiping or return to Shanghai, it is currently undecided. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 6:00 PM on the 8th, Ma Yanchong, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, visited Wang Kemin. Japanese Deputy Consul Nishida visited Wang in the evening and met with Tajiri. When Wang Kemin arrived in Tianjin from Dalian, Yamamoto Eiji, a military attaché of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, accompanied him.

<p>(Tianjin) Wang Kemin arrived in Tianjin this morning at 10:30 AM aboard the Changping Maru via Dalian and immediately entered his residence in the British Concession. He is scheduled to stay for several days to meet with important Chinese and Japanese figures before going to Beiping. (8th Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Wang Kemin told reporters that he came north at the urging of various parties and because he had spent too much money living in Shanghai for ten months. He returned to Tianjin to be a recluse for a while. After his trip south, Chairman Song sent two letters urging him to come quickly. He originally planned to come to Beiping at the end of August, but he postponed it because he was waiting for the representative of the Tianjin garrison to go south to discuss the matter. Recently, he was urged so much that he could not resist and took advantage of his return to Tianjin to come and see. In Dalian, he met with Tanaka Sentada, a staff officer of the Kwantung and North China armies, and Matsuoka, president of the South Manchuria Railway, to exchange views. Since he is not a responsible official, there are many things that they could not directly say. However, Matsuoka seemed to agree with the idea of developing the economy of North China to a certain extent and asked for my opinion on the plan. The Kwantung Army seems to advocate a more active approach, while the North China Army seems to favor a more gradual approach. After arriving in Tianjin, I plan to visit Tashiro at 1:00 PM on the 9th to talk. I will also visit Consul General Tajiri within a few days. I will go to Beiping within a week to meet with Song and convey the opinions of various parties. When I came north, I originally planned to stay for one month and then return south to report. Therefore, after gathering the opinions of all parties, I will have no further responsibility and will return south. In the future, I will return to Tianjin for a long-term stay. As a standing committee member of the Hebei-Chahar Council, I have no other opinions except to obey Chairman Song's orders and have never intended to take on the role of leading any council.

<h3>Recent Active "Quai d'Orsay" Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>In the past few days, the activities of the European aggressor group have been very noteworthy. The Spanish rebels, with the active assistance of international fascist forces, have occupied the important military stronghold of Irun in the north of the country. The Regent of Hungary, Horthy, who had not stepped out of the country since the war, visited Germany and Austria under the guise of "hunting" to establish an anti-Soviet defense line. The reorganization of the Romanian cabinet has been tainted with the colors of the National Socialist Party. The extension of Germany's compulsory military service period allows it to have more than a million troops in peacetime, and there are rumors that the two giants of fascism recently met in Germany. From these facts, the activities of the aggressor group seem to be in a state of general mobilization.</p>
<p>In contrast to the activities of this aggressor group is the active "Quai d'Orsay" diplomacy. Since the establishment of the People's Government, France has become an important pillar of the peace front. In this Spanish civil war, the non-intervention agreement proposed by France is an important tool for maintaining international peace. As French Prime Minister Blum said at the Seine Province Socialist Party Congress on the 6th, "If countries are allowed to compete in supplying arms to both the Spanish government army and the rebels, it will cause endless disasters for the entire European situation, and the conclusion of the non-intervention agreement is to prevent this disaster." Although the non-intervention agreement on the Spanish Civil War was signed only after a long negotiation, the proof of its actual effectiveness will be seen in future facts. However, the conclusion of this agreement has deprived Germany, Italy, and other countries of the excuse to supply arms to the rebels, and at the same time, it has temporarily prevented the expansion of the war on the Iberian Peninsula into a decisive battle between the aggressor front and the peace front of the whole of Europe. The peaceful purpose of "Quai d'Orsay" diplomacy has thus achieved considerable success.</p>
<p>The active scope of "Quai d'Orsay" diplomacy is not limited to passively supporting peace and preventing the expansion of war, but also actively increasing the strength of supporting peace. The most obvious example is the improvement of Franco-Polish relations. A financial and military agreement was signed today, with France lending Poland 225 million francs over five years, part of which will be freely allocated by the Polish government, part of which will be used to purchase raw materials from the Soviet Union, and part of which will be used to purchase military equipment from France to modernize the Polish army and mechanize it. The conclusion of this military-financial agreement can be said to be a major success of recent Quai d'Orsay diplomacy.</p>
<p>The Franco-Polish military-financial agreement has profound significance for historical reasons. We know that Poland's ability to become independent after the war was largely due to French assistance. Therefore, the two countries had a military alliance treaty. However, in 1934, Poland, which was supposed to be France's peripheral force, threw itself into Germany's arms and colluded with the German-Italian group in diplomacy everywhere. Although its alliance treaty with France was not cancelled, the relationship gradually became estranged. At the same time, it adopted a hostile attitude towards France's Eastern European allies, such as Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Poland's diplomatic policy certainly increased the arrogance of the aggressor front. However, recently, Poland felt that there was no good reason to collude with Germany (because even if the aggressor group wins the future war, Poland is in danger of being annexed to the Third Reich). So the relationship with France has improved again. In the middle of last month, French Army Chief of Staff Gamolin first visited Warsaw. Now, General Inspector of the Army Training of Poland, the highest authority, Riz-Smigly, returned the visit to Paris and finally concluded a military-financial agreement to make the military alliance between the two countries more consolidated. Riz-Smigly also assured France that it would abandon its hostile attitude towards Czechoslovakia. At the same time, because part of the French loan is stipulated to be used to purchase Soviet raw materials, the past hostile relations between Poland and the Soviet Union should also be considerably improved. Therefore, the conclusion of this Franco-Polish military-financial agreement not only strengthened France's military strength but also greatly increased the power of the peace front. The significance of this cannot be overstated, and this evolution of the situation is the greatest achievement of the recent active "Quai d'Orsay" diplomacy.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Passes Through Japan and Talks; Britain's Policy Towards the Far East Remains Unchanged; Maintains Economic Interests in China; Anglo-Japanese Alliance is a Thing of the Past; Will Leave Japan for China on the 11th</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, is on his way to China to take office and is staying temporarily at the British Embassy in Tokyo. A special correspondent from the Central News Agency in Tokyo went to the British Embassy to seek an audience and was granted an interview. According to the British Ambassador, the situation in the Far East is now changing. Britain's policy towards the Far East still follows the original system and is no different from before. Although the British Ambassador has a deep understanding of the situation in the East, he is determined to visit the Far East for the first time, so he does not want to make concrete comments on the current situation in the Far East. However, he firmly stated that Britain's greatest interests in China are economic in nature, and trade is the most important. Britain does not want to change its policy but will maintain this interest. Therefore, not only is a peaceful and friendly relationship between China and Britain necessary, but also a peaceful and friendly relationship between Britain and Japan and between China and Japan is considered necessary. The reporter asked whether the London authorities are still willing to work towards peaceful development in China with the cooperation of Japan, as envisioned by British Economic Advisor Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, and the general impression is that Leith-Ross's mission in this regard has largely failed. The British Ambassador smiled and explained to the reporter in detail his several meetings with Leith-Ross before leaving London, saying that when Leith-Ross returned to England, he expressed optimism about the reform of the Chinese currency system, at least. The success of China's currency reform has proven to be amazing, and even Leith-Ross himself, although he has contributed to this major reform, expressed surprise at its success. The Ambassador did not agree with the statement that Leith-Ross's trip was a failure, saying that if there is a possibility of improving the relationship between China, Britain, and Japan, then we should continue to work in this area. Regarding the recent movement to restore the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, the British Ambassador said that he believes that the Anglo-Japanese Alliance is a thing of the past. Britain does not want to unite with any country to oppose other countries. What Britain wants is the same as before, only to maintain friendly relations with all countries in the world. Continuing on, regarding the proposal of some British people to recognize "Manchukuo", the Ambassador firmly declared that the British government's attitude towards this has not changed. The reporter then asked whether Britain was concerned that Japan's gradual expansion of its military power in China, especially in North China, would have a negative impact on British interests. The Ambassador replied that he would have to study the situation closely in the area before he could give a concrete answer to this question but firmly stated that Britain's greatest interests in China are to maintain peace and trade, as he had already said. Therefore, Britain will consider anything that causes turmoil and unrest in any part of China to hinder British interests. Later, when discussing Japan's current policy of promoting its national policy through the "southward advance" policy, the Ambassador humorously said that he is fifty years old and remembers when he was young, someone showed him a map and told him that a certain country wanted to seize certain lands for itself, but so far he feels that this has not become a reality, and that it has caused Britain to worry about the seriousness of the Japanese threat. The British Ambassador is of medium height, with a calm and friendly attitude, polite and courteous, and has the demeanor of an Oriental. He also told the reporter that the British government is not currently planning to move the embassy but intends to move the general office of the embassy from Beiping to Nanjing. He will establish his own base in Nanjing and is willing to stay in Nanjing for half a year each year, and the other half of the year he will live in Beiping, Beidaihe, and travel to other parts of China. The British Ambassador, his wife, son, and two daughters arrived in Yokohama on the 6th and stayed in Tokyo for two hours before going to Nikko with the British Ambassador to Japan, Clive, to spend the weekend. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hosted a banquet to welcome the British Ambassador on the 8th. Foreign Minister Arita was unable to attend due to illness. The British Ambassador will leave Kobe with his family on the British ship Chitral this Friday and will stay in Shanghai for three or four days before going to Nanjing to present his credentials. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita held a luncheon at his official residence at noon on the 8th to welcome the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. However, due to Foreign Minister Arita's illness, Vice Minister Horinouchi delivered the welcoming speech. The British Ambassador delivered a speech of thanks. The guests on this day were British Ambassador to Japan Clive, Minister of the Imperial Household Matsudaira, and President of the Anglo-Japanese Association Hayashi Yōsuke. In addition, Ambassador Clive has scheduled a luncheon at his official residence on the afternoon of the 9th to welcome Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, and has invited Director of the Eurasian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Horinouchi and others to accompany them.

<h3>Suma Visits Foreign Minister Zhang; Exchanges Views on the Chengdu Incident; Wu Zexiang Arrives in Nanjing by Plane from Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Consul General Suma arrived in Nanjing on the Eurasian plane on the morning of the 8th. In the afternoon, he went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang and talked for two hours, leaving at 6:00 PM. It is reported that they continued to exchange views on the Chengdu Incident. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is rumored that the content of Suma's meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang was a preliminary unofficial discussion on the Chengdu case on behalf of Ambassador Kawagoe and that he presented documents related to the matter without involving specific solutions. After returning to the consulate, he immediately telegraphed Kawagoe to report the contents of his conversation with Foreign Minister Zhang and planned to go to Shanghai to meet with him and give a detailed report. After Suma arrives in Shanghai, Kawagoe will enter Nanjing with him within the week and formally negotiate the Chengdu case with Foreign Minister Zhang. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Consul General Suma returned to Nanjing from Shanghai at 7:30 this morning and plans to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang within the day to formally begin negotiations on the Chengdu Incident. Asian Affairs Director Gao Zongwu went to the Japanese Consulate General at 9:30 this morning to arrange the time for Suma's meeting with Zhang. The date for Ambassador Kawagoe's meeting with Minister Zhang will also be decided today. The Ambassador will enter Nanjing in two or three days to conduct concrete negotiations with Minister Zhang.

<h3>Stimson Publishes New Book; Reveals Far East Crisis; Failure to Invoke Nine-Power Treaty Blamed on Britain; Japan's Interests Lie in Friendship with China</h3>
<p>(New York) Former Secretary of State Stimson will publish a new book tomorrow entitled "The Far Eastern Crisis," the main point of which is that it is now difficult for the United States and Japan to reach any agreement on the Manchurian problem because any solution acceptable to Japan will be condemned by China. The book details Stimson's negotiations after the Japanese army occupied Manchuria. First, it states that before the Japanese army occupied Manchuria, the former Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Debuchi, declared to Stimson that American public opinion was "so friendly" to Japan and that he hoped to resolve the immigration issue with the US authorities before retiring. When the Japanese army invaded Manchuria, Stimson criticized Britain for not cooperating with the United States, saying that the United States suffered blows after the US government announced the non-recognition policy. He said that Britain's inability to make a strong statement to Japan at that time made the Japanese believe that Anglo-American cooperation was impossible and allowed Japan to righteously accuse China of disunity and hindering the implementation of treaties. Stimson disclosed the diplomatic process as follows: In February 1932, he intended to advise former British Foreign Secretary Simon to formally take joint action with the United States and invoke the Nine-Power Treaty to deal with Japan, but this action ultimately failed due to Britain's indifference. Finally, Stimson declared that if Japan takes military action in China, it will be enough to prevent it from doing business, and the impact will make it impossible for Japan to balance its budget. For this reason, Japan will eventually realize that its greatest national interests depend on friendship with China, but this is by no means achievable by force. Stimson praised the League of Nations for eliminating wars and preventing Japan from directly annexing Manchuria but believed that the League of Nations Charter and the Treaty of Versailles were integrated, making the League of Nations merely an institution for maintaining the status quo, which he considered a major weakness of the League of Nations. His conclusion predicts that although the relationship between the United States and Japan will inevitably experience ups and downs from time to time, there will be a day when they will restore friendship.

<h3>The Third World Power Conference: 3,000 Delegates Gather in Washington</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Third World Power Conference opened here today, with over three thousand delegates in attendance. American representatives will explain the development of power in the United States over the past fifty years.

<p>(Washington) When welcoming the delegates to the Third World Power Conference today, Secretary of State Hull said that a general war is in danger of breaking out uncontrollably, and the civilization of the world may be utterly destroyed as a result.

<h3>International Lawyers' Conference: Chen Yaodong Speaks on China's Legal System</h3>
<p>(Vienna) At a meeting of the International Bar Association yesterday, Dr. Chen Yaodong, Professor of the Law School of National Central University of China, was elected as an Executive Committee member. He also delivered a speech on China's judicial organization and consular jurisdiction, which was warmly welcomed by delegates from various countries. The main points of Dr. Chen's speech are appended below: "The National Government of China, under the leadership of the Kuomintang and General Chiang Kai-shek, has made many reforms and achieved remarkable results. For example, the current judicial organization and legislative work, in some respects, are even superior to those of Western countries. However, the consular jurisdiction system still in practice is not only an infringement of China's sovereignty but has also lost its raison d'être and should be abolished." Austrian President Miklas and Prime Minister Schuschnigg met with Dr. Chen Yaodong yesterday. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Republican Presidential Candidate Landon Announces Platform: Opposes Racial Conflict</h3>
<p>Wichita, Kansas, USA. Republican presidential candidate Landon, on Labor Day, delivered a speech to the American Legion, commenting on the development of the situation in which various races in the United States are clashing with each other, and called on the veterans to work together to correct it. The gist of his speech was: "In the past, Christians, Catholics, and Jews worked together in harmony, but now this is not the case. The trend of encouraging racial struggle has gradually emerged and cannot be ignored. The reason for this is mostly that people around the world have been stimulated and lost their normality since the economic panic. Some countries have taken hostile actions against different races, and the United States has also been affected." Regarding the issue of peace, he said, "We have not advocated war, so even if we do our best to reduce the danger of being drawn into the vortex of war, the effect is minimal. Our ancestors came from Europe, so we should prepare everything to do our best to eliminate the disasters of the old continent. In short, we must have a clear head." Political observers generally believe that Landon's speech is extremely important. First, some newspapers representing the Democratic Party's "New Deal" have repeatedly criticized Landon for having anti-Semitic tendencies. Second, Democratic newspapers often claim that Roosevelt is a friend of peace and is more practical and effective than Landon. Therefore, Landon specifically made this speech to express his opposition to racial conflict and support for peace legislation, which was aimed at the Democratic newspapers. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>German National Socialist Party Congress: Advocates Anti-Soviet Policy; Over 500,000 Participants; Pictures of Starving Children Distributed Everywhere</h3>

Führer Hitler will arrive tonight, and all the churches in the city will ring their bells in salute, and all the houses in the city will hang the Swastika flag to express their welcome. The congress will last for eight days. Over 500,000 members of the "Brownshirt Political Soldiers" will participate.

(Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Nuremberg. The National Socialist Party Congress will open here tomorrow, and all the arrangements are very moving. It is reported that the German government has allocated £2 million to provide food and lodging for thousands of representatives. There are hundreds of National Socialist Party groups represented, the most famous of which are the Labor Corps, Storm Troopers, Hitler Youth, Air Defense Corps, and over 90,000 political officials.

The representatives will hold an anti-extremist exhibition, and pictures of starving babies in the Russian disaster will be posted everywhere, and photos will be distributed in all directions. According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the semi-official Soviet newspaper Moscow Daily News published news about the congress and made harsh criticisms of the propaganda methods adopted by Germany, stating that Germany's anti-Soviet movement was not generated automatically, but was planned and organized by the German Propaganda Ministry. Its purpose is only to divert the world's attention so that they do not pay attention to the increase in the German army. The newspaper also ridiculed the leaflets and photos of starving children, saying that this was invented by Germany to cover up its own need for food. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>

Yurenev asked the Japanese side to guarantee that such incidents would not happen again in the future. (TASS Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Criticizes German Newspapers' Anti-Russian Propaganda</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the anti-Soviet propaganda of German newspapers, the Moscow News Special Editorial writes:</p>
<p>"The international press has had many opportunities to be deeply convinced that this kind of anti-Soviet news propaganda is by no means a free creation of fascist journalists, but an organized and systematic propaganda of the German Propaganda Ministry. It is precisely under the orders of the German Propaganda Ministry that the German press is fully mobilized to spread inaccurate news about the number of Red Army soldiers.</p>
<p>"These people use the Soviet law of lowering the conscription age as an excuse, but they actually know that this law will never increase the number of Red Army soldiers. The current situation of the Red Army is the same as the news released by the Soviet government and is the same as before. This is known to the whole world. Therefore, the news about the number of Red Army soldiers published in German newspapers is all fabricated and is also deeply known to the global press. The global press can also clearly understand that this kind of anti-Soviet propaganda is used by Germany to cover up its own doubling of military strength."</p>
<p>Referring to the false news broadcast by the German newspapers about the famine in Ukraine, the riots of the people, the conflicts between soldiers and civilians, and the Red Army soldiers and officers disobeying orders, the newspaper said, "Although the German newspapers fabricated this kind of slander, they actually know that there has never been a conflict between the Red Army and the people. On the contrary, the workers of the whole country are extremely fond of and respect the Red Army. The Propaganda Ministry's slander of the Red Army is precisely because the Red Army is a major obstacle to the realization of the German imperialist and militarist aggressive policies.</p>
<p>"Journalists from various countries stationed in Moscow have repeatedly proved the falsehood of the news about the famine in Ukraine broadcast by Germany. They have jointly proved with Soviet newspapers that this year's harvest in Ukraine is by no means lower than last year's, and the harvest in the entire Soviet Union is actually better than last year's, especially in the Odessa province, which the German newspapers claimed had famine riots. Goebbels' fabrication of this lie is obviously to cover up the situation of the daily shortage of food in his own country. There is no doubt about it.</p>
<p>"Regarding the recent public trial of Trotskyist terrorists, the German newspapers also released a lot of rumors, saying that many government officials, Red Army officers, and diplomats were arrested. The ridiculousness of this kind of lie has already been exposed by the Soviet government's official newspaper.</p>
<p>"The German newspapers spread rumors and also adopted a despicable and shameless method, such as falsely claiming that the news was sent by journalists stationed in Soviet cities, but there are actually no German journalists in those cities. This method is also taught by the German Propaganda Ministry, and they sometimes even list a place that does not actually exist on top of the self-made news.</p>
<p>"The German state-run news agency also openly participates in this slander work, and they specifically take the path of instigating national hatred, which is proposed by Hitler in his "Mein Kampf."</p>
<p>"The purpose and method of instigating national animosity can be clearly seen in the current anti-Soviet propaganda and is a characteristic of Germany's consistent policy. Since it is already like this, any advice, protest, or warning to the German press or to the German government that is instigating them will be useless.</p>
<p>"Inaccurate news complicates international relations and increases anxiety and panic. However, the German government's organization and development of this kind of anti-Soviet propaganda is obviously intended to increase the anxiety and panic of the whole world. People who uphold peace all over the world must pay special attention to this continuous anti-Soviet propaganda and must mobilize the public opinion of all countries to fight against it to eliminate this new threat to peace from Berlin."

<h3>Albanian Emperor Appeals to the World: Will Never Surrender to Italy</h3>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia, who has been a guest here for a long time, has issued an appeal to all countries in the world, stating that a formal government still exists in the western city of Gore, and that the land occupied by the Italian army is only one-third. "Moreover, in this occupied territory, they have to dig deep trenches and build high walls to guard themselves cautiously, and they have to rely on the air force to barely maintain control. In addition, the people of our country have never been willing to surrender to the Italian forces. Even in the vicinity of Addis Ababa, there are often actions to resist the Italian army. The Italian air force often throws bombs in various places and warns our people that once the rainy season is over, they will start a massacre to retaliate. At the same time, they also want to deceive our people and falsely claim that our government no longer exists. Their failure to control the overall situation is becoming increasingly obvious."

<h3>Portugal Rebellion: Two Warships and Tax Collection Rebellions; Fortresses Bombard and Surrender; Government Declares Partial Martial Law</h3>
<p>Lisbon. The warship Albuquerque and the destroyer Douro, now docked in the Tagus River, suddenly mutinied today, but surrendered after being bombarded by the Almada Fortress. It is generally believed that this is a prelude to a Portuguese rebellion, but the government authorities say that this is an accidental incident and that the country is very peaceful. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Lisbon. A part of the sailors of two Portuguese warships rebelled today and seized command of the ships, firing on the Lisbon Fortress, causing a great shock in Lisbon. The land artillery at that time returned fire and hit several shells, and both ships were damaged. During the exchange of fire, several shells fell into the port of Lisbon. The rebels surrendered immediately, and both ships were towed to the Tagus Port. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The news of the Portuguese warship rebellion was first transmitted to London by private sources. The telegram only said that two warships bombarded the Lisbon Fortress, and the Fortress also returned fire, but did not mention which country the two ships belonged to. Everyone is very concerned about this news, especially because the telephones to Lisbon cannot be connected. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Lisbon. The crew of the Portuguese coast guard ship "Afonso de Albuquerque" and the destroyer "Dão" suddenly mutinied. The government sent troops to suppress them, resulting in six deaths and nine injuries to the crew of the "Afonso de Albuquerque." The government also declared a state of alert afterward, and all troops were not allowed to leave their barracks and should guard all important places to prevent them. The entrances of all agencies have also been heavily guarded by the police. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Lisbon. As a result of the rebellion of some of the sailors of two Portuguese warships, the Portuguese government has declared a partial martial law. All troops in Lisbon have been ordered not to leave their barracks without authorization, and all important locations have been stationed by troops. All public buildings are now guarded by the police. It was decided that the warships participating in the rebellion were the small gunboat "Afonso Albuquerque" and the destroyer "Douro." After the government received news of the rebellion of the two ships, it quickly took action and ordered the coastal fortresses to prepare for bombardment. Therefore, after the rebels opened the first shot, the fortresses immediately returned fire, and both ships were hit and immediately surrendered. Currently, the two ships have been towed into the Tagus Port. Passengers on the British ships "Asturias" and "Stralethmore" witnessed the thrilling situation during the bombardment. It is reported that the "Stralethmore" avoided entering the Tagus Port when the two sides began to bombard each other. The ship acted quickly, opened its engines, and entered the port from the mouth of the Tagus Sea. The whole of Portugal is now extremely peaceful. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Gradually Encircle Madrid; The Situation in the Capital is Unbearable; The Authorities Take Strict Air Defense Measures</h3>
<p>Madrid. The rebels are slowly encircling Madrid, causing the situation in the capital to deteriorate. Food is extremely scarce.

At the same time, the capital is being attacked by the rebels from the air every day, so the authorities have to take strict measures to cope with the crisis. Street lights are painted dark blue, and air raid shelters have been prepared in various places in the city. The authorities have also ordered underground stations to be open all night.

<p>Hendaye. San Sebastian, a famous summer resort in northern Spain, is expected to fall at any time because the anarchists and socialists in the garrison are fighting each other, and the authorities cannot maintain order. The residents of the town are also tired of the war. Today, more than a thousand women, all holding babies, are walking around the streets, asking the government troops to surrender as soon as possible to save their own lives and the lives of their children. The anarchists are now mainly burning and destroying the town, while the socialists are trying to prevent the anarchists from setting fires. The rebels have captured the Guadaluque battery and Huolanlachia today, so they have completely occupied the city of Irun. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>International Neutrality Committee Holds First Meeting; 24 Countries Participate</h3>
<p>(London) The British government has notified the governments concerned that the International Committee for handling the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War will hold its first meeting at the Foreign Office on Wednesday. London now hopes to receive the final reply from the Portuguese government before Wednesday. The interpretation of the work of the committee has been sent to the Portuguese government and is the same as that sent to Berlin. Portuguese representatives may attend the first meeting. A total of 24 countries participated in the committee. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The International Coordinating Committee on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to hold its first meeting at noon tomorrow. The responsible parties believe that if the committee seeks a compromise between the views held by the United Kingdom, France, and Italy at that time, it will inevitably encounter great difficulties. This is because Italy had previously proposed two reservations: first, to prohibit the people of all countries from providing financial assistance to the two warring parties in Spain; second, to prohibit the people of all countries from holding demonstrations or volunteering to serve in the two warring parties in Spain. In the United Kingdom and France, due to the various principles contained in the democratic system, it is difficult to adopt this radical approach. It is learned that the French Ambassador G尔平 will meet with Sir 西泰, the decision-maker of the British Foreign Office, this afternoon to draft the agenda of the International Coordinating Committee. According to the responsible parties, at tomorrow's meeting, the chairman of the committee, namely Morrisen, the standing decision-maker of the British Treasury, will first deliver an opening speech. It was decided that Ambassador G尔平 would deliver a speech as the representative of the initiating country, and then submit the agenda for a vote and appoint a committee to review the various measures that the countries concerned have taken on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The second step is to study the various new measures proposed by the countries, including the above-mentioned reservations proposed by Italy. According to foreign sources here, the various measures that the International Coordinating Committee can decide on will not take effect unless they are formally accepted by the governments of various countries. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The International Coordinating Committee on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War is now scheduled to hold its first meeting on Wednesday of this week. Political figures hope that before the meeting is held on this day, the Portuguese government can decide to unconditionally join the committee. All countries attending the committee will be represented by their ambassadors to London. The representative of the French government will be the French Ambassador to the UK, 戈尔平. The representative of the German government will be Prince Bismarck, the acting German Ambassador to the UK. The United Kingdom intends to be represented by Morrisen, the standing decision-maker of the Treasury, and will serve as the chairman of the committee. Morrisen is a well-known member of the Conservative Party caucus in the Parliament. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France. The Spanish government's attitude has recently hindered the humanization of the Spanish Civil War by the diplomatic corps stationed in Spain. The Spanish government representative is still staying here, but it has been clearly denied by the new cabinet of Spanish left-wing leader Caballeros. It is heard that the Madrid authorities are currently unwilling to reach a compromise with the rebels. The recent proposals of the diplomatic corps have been firmly rejected. It is rumored that the rebels, because the government troops are using poison gas to fight, have threatened to take the same action in retaliation. The British Acting Agent 福白斯 has been instructed by the British government to inquire the truth from the Madrid authorities and inform them that if there is such an action, public opinion in all countries will not approve of it. 祁尔登, the British Ambassador to Spain, who is currently in安达伊, has been asked to try to convey the same warning to the rebel side, so that they know that the use of poison gas in the civil war will have serious consequences, but the United Kingdom has not yet obtained evidence of the use of poison gas.

<h3>Army Inspector-General of Poland Changes Mind and Returns Home from France; Poland's Successful Policy of Non-Alignment</h3>
<p>General Ryz-Smigly, the Inspector-General of Military Education of the Polish Army, departed from France yesterday and returned home via Italy. He arrived here this afternoon and is scheduled to visit Duke Genoa, an Italian aristocrat, tomorrow, and will spend a few days relaxing in the surrounding area before returning home at the end of this week. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Various newspapers have recently commented on the visit of Army Inspector-General Ryz-Smigly to France. The wording clearly originates from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and all believe that this decision to engage with France is a result of Poland's policy of non-alignment in recent years. Even the opposition newspapers "Warsaw Evening News" and "Warsaw Courier" consider the outcome of General Ryz-Smigly's visit to France satisfactory. "Warsaw Evening News" stated, "The talks recently held in Paris between France and Poland have achieved concrete results, sufficiently strengthening the current alliance between the two countries. Polish public opinion expresses genuine happiness." "Warsaw Courier" reported, "Of all collective actions of a defensive nature, the current alliance between France and Poland is the most important. In recent years, our country's foreign policy has neglected this type of action and leaned too much towards rapprochement with Germany. This period has now become a thing of the past." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) General Smigly, the Polish Army Inspector-General, recently signed two Franco-Polish protocols while staying in Paris. These protocols reaffirmed the alliance between the two countries and stipulated that France would lend Poland 27 million pounds, half of which would be in the form of military supplies in lieu of cash, and the other half divided into three parts as follows: (1) France will assume Polish debts owed to French legal entities; (2) France will provide funding to complete the Gdynia to Katowice railway; (3) France will provide re-discount loans to the Polish Bank.

(Havas dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After 300,000 metallurgical workers in the capital and surrounding areas went on strike for one hour yesterday afternoon, several other industries in the country seem to be following suit. The Socialist Party's newspaper, "People's News," believes that the main purpose of the labor unrest is to demand increased wages and improved working conditions. Other newspapers, including the Communist Party's newspaper, "Humanity," say that the action is in protest against the government's ban on arms supplies to Spain. In addition, former Minister of Justice, Lémeret, Senator of Martinique, a French territory in the North Atlantic, recently sent a letter to Prime Minister Léon Blum, stating that the workers had not followed the words expressed by the Prime Minister during the demonstration held by the Seine branch of the Socialist Party at the Palais de la Mutualité. The workers announced a strike yesterday, which is using pressure on the government's foreign policy. This kind of action is "quite illegal, and can even be called a rebellion." If the striking workers, as rumored, occupy factories, exclude management, and adopt the methods of Soviet communists, freely acting, it is unknown what steps the government intends to take to maintain social tranquility.

Therefore, the British Trades Union Congress has decided to do everything possible to maintain peace in all countries and to protect the democratic system at all costs. Anything that harms the working class of one country will inevitably harm the working class of other countries. The Spanish events are a clear example. Therefore, we should establish closer ties with American labor circles in the future, and sincerely hope that American labor circles will quickly unite with brothers from all countries, regardless of religion or ethnicity, to form an unbreakable connection.

<h3>The Palestine Question: Important Declaration by the British Government; Deploying Troops but Also Preparing for Negotiations; Mixed Reactions from Arabs</h3>
<p>(London) The British Colonial Office issued an important declaration today, indicating that the British government will take swift and effective action to curb the disturbances in Palestine. The declaration stated: "After careful observation of the entire situation, the British government feels that it can no longer tolerate the riots and disturbances incited by Arab leaders, attempting to change the British government's policies as a result. More rapid and effective action must be taken now to bring the disturbances to an end as soon as possible. The British government deeply regrets having to implement this decision. The conditions under which Britain accepted the mandate of Palestine stipulated that it was responsible for the welfare of all levels of the people of Palestine. Britain recognizes this responsibility as a trust, and there is no other way than to implement it." The declaration issued by the Colonial Office today is actually related to the communiqué issued by the highest military authorities in Palestine. According to the communiqué, Britain is sending another division of troops to Palestine, increasing its responsibilities. It is intended to entrust this important responsibility to Lieutenant General Dill, the former Director of Military Operations and Intelligence at the War Office. The declaration issued by the Colonial Office today first provides an introduction, briefly describing the events since the disturbances in Palestine in April, and stating that after the riots in Jaffa and other places were quickly quelled, prominent Arabs organized committees and announced a general strike of political significance. The objectives they sought were completely inconsistent with the purpose of the mandate. Furthermore, armed terrorists roamed around, and assassinations and other atrocities spread daily. In addition to British soldiers, airmen, and police officers being attacked by these mobs from time to time, even Jewish and Arab victims were too numerous to count. Attempts to disrupt traffic order were repeatedly made, resulting in significant material losses and severely impacting Palestine's economic situation. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Palestinian administrative authorities immediately took active measures to protect the lives and property of citizens and to prevent the continuation of the disturbances. The garrison in Palestine has also been increased accordingly. The British authorities have tried their best to be tolerant, in accordance with the British government's desire to protect peace and alleviate the suffering of the people, but political strikes have continued unabated, and riots and guerrilla warfare have been heard from time to time. In short, this situation is tantamount to directly provoking the British authorities in Palestine. The declaration also stated that the Imperial Committee repeatedly issued communiqués, the content of which was published on July 29. The Colonial Secretary repeatedly assured that the Committee intends to investigate the truth of this incident after order is restored in Palestine. The declaration also cited the communiqué issued by the Permanent Mandates Commission of 1930, in which the mandate obligations regarding the two peoples of Palestine, Jewish and Arab, were extremely equal and could not be more in agreement. The declaration continued: "The British government greatly agrees with the meaning of the communiqué of the International Permanent Mandates Commission and is willing to implement an impartial policy towards both the Jewish and Arab peoples, seeking peace and progress for the country they deeply love. British policy is to maintain friendly relations with the Muslim people and gain their trust. Therefore, the actions currently taken are taken out of necessity and are not what we desire. It must be understood that a government, even one responsible for a mandate, cannot change its original policy due to riots and disturbances. However, the British government still hopes that those who are currently disturbing the peace of Palestine will eventually repent, realize that their actions are hindering the real interests of the people at all levels and the welfare of the country, and understand the impartiality of the mandated government, so that the Imperial Committee can come to Palestine to carry out its investigation mission. Finally, it is hoped that the Imperial Committee will make suggestions afterwards, so that this situation of mutual suspicion can be brought to an end, and the tragedies of misunderstanding and turmoil of the past five months can be finally resolved.

<p>(London) The War Office has recently announced that Lieutenant General Dill will be the commander of the British forces stationed in Palestine. Lieutenant General Dill was the Director of Military Operations and Intelligence at the War Office and is an outstanding talent in the British Army.

<p>Jerusalem: The British Colonial Office's declaration that Britain will implement coercive measures in Palestine has aroused various reactions among the people here. The Arab Higher Committee has convened an emergency meeting to discuss the current situation. Security is very strict, and the situation is impossible to ascertain, but the general mood here seems to be unstable. On the one hand, there is hope that the Arabs will understand that their situation has attracted worldwide attention and decide to cancel their strike without losing face. On the other hand, there is fear that die-hard elements among the Arabs will engage in incitement and forceful resistance. At the same time, Fuqi, a well-known Arab rebel leader who recently arrived in Palestine from Syria, has been vigorously engaged in propaganda. The most noteworthy of these is Fuqi's mention of the participation of Iraqi and Syrian troops. However, according to reports in the Arab press, Iraqi Foreign Minister General Nuri does not seem to intend to return here to continue mediation. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Iraq's Proposal on the Question of Amending the League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations, in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly in July of this year, has solicited suggestions from its member states regarding the amendment of the League of Nations Covenant. To date, multiple suggestions from various countries have been received. The Secretariat of the League of Nations has recently received proposals from Iraq and Peru. The Iraqi government's proposal advocates separating the League of Nations Covenant from the various peace treaties concluded in 1919, and argues that the collective security system stipulated in the Covenant should be strengthened through regional agreements. As for the Peruvian government's proposal, it expresses opinions on each article of the League of Nations Covenant, and puts forward multiple amendments on the conditions for joining member states, the reorganization of the Executive Council, and the reform of its election system. In addition, it also advocates abolishing the distinction between permanent treaties and non-permanent treaties. The proposal indicates that the Peruvian government supports strengthening the provisions of Article 10 of the Covenant regarding the protection of territorial integrity, but the actions and implementation of sanctions stipulated in Article 16 should be restricted. Finally, the Peruvian government requests that the method of amending treaties stipulated in Article 19 of the Covenant should be effective if passed by a two-thirds majority of the League of Nations General Assembly.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders All Customs Offices to Pay Attention to Civilian Ships and Automobiles Transporting Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance instructed the finance departments of various provinces and all customs offices to the effect that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Anti-Smuggling Committee proposed that the government should vigorously suppress smuggling. Although smuggled goods have gradually disappeared from ships on the Yangtze and roads, unscrupulous people are avoiding inspection by transporting smuggled goods inland for sale by small launches or long-distance automobiles. Anti-smuggling agencies in various places have not yet paid universal attention. In addition, current anti-smuggling work often causes difficulties for the transport and sale of legitimate goods to various places, with unwarranted detentions by inspectors. Please find a way to provide relief. Please issue a general order to all anti-smuggling agencies to pay attention to civilian ships, small launches, and highways, and strictly guard against smuggled goods transported by automobiles. At the same time, please ask the inspectors not to arbitrarily cause difficulties for the transport and sale of legitimate goods. The regulations for the inspection of imported goods are very clear on the inspection methods for goods loaded on inland river steamers, civilian ships, automobiles, and trains. These should be earnestly enforced. Inspectors should not arbitrarily cause difficulties for the transport and sale of legitimate goods, causing disturbances. This order is issued.

<h3>American Espionage Expert Suggests Implementing a Prevention System to Prevent the Leakage of Military Secrets</h3>
<p>(New York) Mason, an international espionage expert and author, delivered a speech here today, urging the United States to adopt an espionage prevention system to counter the countless spies from other countries who come here to probe America’s most important national defense secrets. Mason, who studied espionage during the European War, stated tonight that the naval and land secrets on which American security depends have become public knowledge for the intelligence agencies of various countries due to the lack of an espionage prevention system. The United States spends millions of dollars on national defense, but spends not a penny to protect its most valuable secrets. Therefore, all new inventions related to warships, aircraft, guns, cannons, and poison gas are known to other countries due to carelessness. The world’s major powers all have well-trained espionage prevention systems that can be easily implemented. (7th National Press)</p>
<h3>Over Ninety Counties in Guangdong Submit This Year’s Budget to the Ministry of Finance</h3>

<h3>Person in Charge of the Ministry of Civil Service States That the Salary Schedule Does Not Need to Be Revised</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It was previously reported that the outside world believed that the temporary salary schedule for civil and military officials was too divided and the treatment was inconsistent, and hoped to revise it. According to the person in charge of the Ministry of Civil Service, although the official salary schedule is divided into 36 levels for simple recommendation and appointment, appointed officials are divided into three grades. New appointees may start from the lowest level of each grade. Simple recommendations also have the lowest level of each official grade. Those with outstanding performance may be awarded two levels of salary at once. The regulations on performance evaluation, rewards, and punishments also provide for the possibility of advancing two levels. Although the official salary schedule stipulates a large number of levels, there is still room for flexibility in promotion. The original schedule was revised and approved based on the opinions of various central agencies. Now, the salary schedule for police officers has also been changed to be consistent with that of civil officials. If it is revised again, not only will the procedures be complicated and involve many things, but since the original schedule has great flexibility, if one is indeed a talented person, it will take only ten years or so to be promoted from an appointed position to a recommended position, and one can rise level by level. There is no need for thirty or forty years. It seems that there is no need to revise it. The grade differences between the official positions of the National Government, the Five Yuan, and the military officers in the ministries and commissions as stipulated in the original schedule are actually due to the fact that the original schedule was formulated based on the established facts at the time of revision. If the National Government’s column is lowered, it is not allowed by the facts. Raising the column for the Five Yuan and the ministries and commissions is not possible for the country’s finances. The National Government is the highest administrative agency in the country, and it is not excessive to slightly increase the official grades of its civil servants in terms of system. It seems that the current situation can be maintained. Furthermore, according to the Civil Service Performance Evaluation Law and the Performance Evaluation Reward and Punishment Regulations, those who are evaluated as first-class should be promoted. The current official salary schedule has more levels and the grade differences are not large, which allows the majority of civil servants in various agencies to be promoted and receive salary increases. The combined increase is also limited, and it will not affect the budget of each agency. If the number of levels is reduced, then the level salaries will increase accordingly. If no promotions are given every year during the performance evaluation, it will lose the meaning of rewards. If many promotions are given, then the salary increase will be huge. The country is currently facing national difficulties, and there are doubts about whether the country’s financial resources can afford it. Therefore, the implementation of the current official salary schedule does not have any obstacles. (8th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Wu Dingchang Talks About the Four-Province Cooperation Projects, Which Must Start From Simple and Clear Steps</h3>
<p>(Anqing) Liu Yiyan, the Director of the Construction Department, accompanied Wu Dingchang, the Minister of Industry, to inspect the cooperative undertakings of various counties to Wuhu. Wu returned to Nanjing by turning. He returned to the province from Jiangxin transporting on the morning of the 8th. (8th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The reporter recently visited the Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang, and asked about his recent inspection of the cooperative undertakings in the four provinces and the future improvement plan. According to him, this inspection took a total of seventeen days and covered the four provinces of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei. In addition to visiting local authorities and visiting industrial and commercial enterprises and the special products of each province, most of the time was spent on on-site inspections in rural areas. However, due to the short time, only a general impression was obtained. The major points are as follows: (1) The cooperative laws and regulations must be unified, and the undertakings should be handled carefully by the local authorities according to local conditions. The central government should provide guidance and necessary assistance. (2) There are seven categories of cooperative business, but the type of business to be handled should be determined according to the needs of the members. According to the inspection, one type must be handled well before the second type is handled. It is not appropriate to force more to be handled. At present, farmers are very eager for credit lending to be used for production purposes. Therefore, how to develop credit lending is indeed a question that the people of the country should study today. (3) The joint organization of cooperatives should be based on its constituent members. Only when the organization of individual cooperatives is sound can it be effective. (4) Cooperative undertakings are organizations to improve the economic life of the people. Therefore, when promoting cooperation, one should always consider the economic life of the people themselves and should not include other meanings in between. (5) Whether the cooperative undertaking is pure and promising depends on whether the cadres who handle the cooperative undertaking in each locality are appropriate. Those who understand things well often lack the moral character to be role models, and those who are generally old and virtuous lack the ability to handle affairs. Therefore, when promoting cooperation, it is hoped that appropriate personnel will be trained. (6) Cooperation is a permanent undertaking. Being eager for success can easily damage the foundation, and once it fails, it will be more difficult to proceed. Now, cooperative undertakings have attracted the attention of people all over the country. According to the inspection, my country’s cooperative undertakings are still in their infancy. It is impossible to talk about this with the general knowledge of farmers. Even finding simple cooperative talents is not easy, let alone involving complexity. Therefore, although we cannot but have this great expectation, we must never make this great expectation want to be realized immediately. We still need to be down-to-earth and start from the four words “simple and clear” and gradually expand. We can naturally achieve success. Therefore, in the future, we still plan to stick to the stable and progressive principle and consult with local authorities to proceed. (8th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Waste Land Reclamation: Key Points for Supervision Measures</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan passed the following key points for supervision measures regarding the implementation of waste land reclamation in various inland provinces and cities at its morning meeting on the 8th: (1) All reclaimable waste land in inland provinces and cities should be implemented in two phases. The first phase covers the twelve provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Henan, Gansu, and Shaanxi, as well as the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai. The second phase covers the six provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, Hebei, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, as well as the three cities of Qingdao, Peiping, and Tianjin. (2) For the first-phase provinces and cities, if the survey and reporting of waste land have not been carried out in accordance with the Interim Measures for Clearing Waste Land, or if the information is incomplete, the deadline for reporting is still the end of this year, and reclamation will be implemented from the 26th year onwards. (3) For the second-phase provinces and cities, the deadline for completing the survey and reporting is the end of the 27th year, and reclamation will be implemented from the 28th year onwards. (4) When implementing reclamation, public and private waste land should be handled separately. If the public waste land covers an area of more than 5,000 mu, the county government should report to the provincial government for handling. If it is less than 5,000 mu, the county and city governments are responsible for soliciting reclamation. In cities directly under the Executive Yuan, the city government will handle it. For private waste land, the owners will be urged to reclaim or solicit reclamation. (5) When soliciting reclamation, county and city governments should formulate implementation plans in accordance with the Regulations for Contracting State-Owned Waste Land and its Implementing Rules, as well as the principles of supervising reclamation under the Interim Measures for Clearing Waste Land, and the principles of encouraging and assisting migration for reclamation. These plans should be submitted to the provincial government for review and then forwarded to the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry for record. If reclamation is handled by the provincial government or a city directly under the Executive Yuan, the implementation plan should be sent to the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry for record. (6) If the reclamation of waste land requires the construction of water conservancy and transportation projects, and the expenses are large and there are indeed difficulties, the county and city governments should submit a budget each year, stating the reasons and proposing an engineering plan, and request subsidies from the provincial government. If it is handled by the province or a city directly under the Executive Yuan, it should be submitted to the central government for consideration of subsidies. (7) County and city governments are responsible for urging the owners of private waste land to implement reclamation in accordance with the following regulations. In cities directly under the Executive Yuan, the city government is responsible for urging them. (8) County and city governments should prepare an annual report on the reclamation of waste land each year and submit it to the provincial government for forwarding to the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry for record. If it is handled by the province or a city directly under the Executive Yuan, it should be directly sent to the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Industry for record.

<h3>Yellow River in Shaanzhou Continues to Rise; Flood Prevention on the Yellow River in Shandong is Critical; The Head of the Flood Has Passed Lishengtun and is Approaching Luokou; River Bureau Director Wang Kairu Goes Upstream to Supervise Prevention</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River in Shaanzhou, upstream, suddenly rose sharply on the 5th of this month. The water level and flow rate were almost the same as when the Chongzhuang breach occurred last year. On the 6th, the head of the flood had passed Zhongmou. This morning (7th), its highest level had passed Lishengtun, upstream of the Shandong border. It will reach Luokou in the middle reaches tonight. In this environment of a large flood entering the border, according to the water reports from various reaches received by the River Affairs Bureau today (7th), the water level at Lishengtun suddenly rose by more than 1.3 chi from the night of the 6th to 10:00 a.m. on the 7th. Guanzhuang and Luokou in the middle reaches have also seen increases under the high pressure of the upstream water. There have been no significant changes in the water level at Xiezhiwan and Damajia downstream. However, today (7th), the River Affairs Bureau continued to receive a telegram from Kong Xiangrong, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, stating that he had just received a telegram from Longmen, stating that the water level at Longmen reached 91.23 meters on the 4th of this month, and the flow rate in Shaanzhou below increased to 17,700 cubic meters per second. On the 6th, the water level at Longmen continued to rise to 92.01 meters. It is expected that today (7th) the flow rate in Shaanzhou and below will inevitably be higher than before. The telegram ordered all on-site personnel along the river to continue their efforts, guard day and night, and not slacken in the slightest. Wang Kairu, Director of the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau, went upstream to supervise prevention early on the 6th after the water rose in Shaanzhou. Today (7th), he had driven to Dongzhuang. After receiving the telegram from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, he reported to Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government. In view of the continuous rise of water in the Longmen and Shaanzhou areas upstream of the Yellow River, which will soon reach Shandong, and that the flood prevention along the river has reached a critical stage, for the sake of caution, and to decide on flood prevention at Dongzhuang, he telegraphed Han to urge the magistrates of the counties along the river to quickly mobilize laborers to the dikes to guard day and night, hoping to ensure safety. At the same time, he telegraphed the two general section chiefs, the ten section chiefs, the five dike chiefs of the Dike Works Bureau, and the flood prevention personnel along the river upstream to supervise their subordinates and strictly guard against the situation to get through this critical juncture.</p>
<p>Water Levels in Various Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province</p>
<p>At 6:00 p.m. today (7th), Pan Jianfen, Chief of the Engineering Section of the River Affairs Bureau (who set off at the same time as Wang Kairu), said in a telephone call that the water in the Longmen and Shaanzhou areas had stopped rising. Kong Xiangrong has returned to Kaifeng and is scheduled to come to Jinan on the 9th to attend the sixth anniversary commemoration and encouragement meeting of the Provincial Government. As of 6:00 p.m. on the 7th, the water levels in various reaches of this province were as follows: Lishengtun upstream rose a total of 1.3 chi for the whole day, with a water level of 58.7 meters; Guanzhuang in the middle reaches rose 3 cun, with a water level of 35.76 meters; Luokou rose 1.8 cun, with a water level of 30.07 meters; Xiezhiwan downstream had a normal water level of 18.93 meters; Damajia fell 1 cun, with a water level of 14.55 meters.

<h3>Bandits Rampant in Various Counties in Southern Jiangxi; Forts Are Often Captured; Many Innocent People Are Killed</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: In the past, the scourge of bandits in Jiangxi spread throughout the province. The Central Government devoted its full efforts and several years of effort to suppress the Red Bandits, who threatened the nation and the people. However, since Zhu and Mao fled westward, although the large forces have been pacified, there are still sporadic small groups everywhere. The most rampant are the remnants of Fang Shao and the Huang Ligui gang, who harass the border areas of Wuyuan, Dechang, and Fuliang, and spread to Xiuning and Kaihua. The remnants of Xu Yangang and Gao Yongsheng are hiding in the mountains around Xiuwu and Tongyi. A few days ago, 400-500 people disturbed the Jiangxi-Hunan Road and captured the station personnel at Shinao Weir on the Gaoshang section. Another group attempted to enter Fengxin City. Fortunately, the county had early warnings, and the city gates were tightly closed, so the bandits did not succeed. The counties of Fengjing and Gao are now holding a joint meeting for suppression in Yifeng. As for the southern Jiangxi area, scattered bandits in Chongyi, Shangyou, Xinfeng, Yudu, and Xunwu are hiding in the mountains and appearing and disappearing unpredictably. Previously, because the 1st Army of Guangdong, led by Yu Hanmou, suppressed them with a large army, the remnants of the bandits began to retreat slightly. Now that the Guangdong army has returned to Guangdong, the scattered bandits in Chongyou and Xinyu counties have become active again. At the end of last month, when Li Dezhao, a member of the provincial government, patrolled from Ganzhou to Dayu, the bandits in Chijiang fought fiercely with the police, and traffic was cut off, so he turned back halfway. The forts guarded by the Xinfeng four-village militia are often attacked and captured by bandits, and many innocent people are brutally killed. If this continues, it is feared that it will spread like wildfire. The provincial government has now sent Deputy Security Director Liao Shiqiao, Security Team Leader Lai Weiying, and his Chief of Staff Xiong Bin to various places in southern and western Jiangxi to supervise the suppression.

<h3>Epidemic Spreading in Anhui Province; Ministry of Health Sends Personnel for Prevention and Control</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: This year, Anhui Province has had a full harvest of various agricultural products, and the recovery of farmers is celebrated, and the commercial market is active. Unexpectedly, an epidemic broke out in the inner counties after autumn, and deaths followed one after another. Recently, due to the improper weather, the epidemic has become even more rampant. The places where it has occurred include the counties of Chaoxian, Dangtu, Nanling, and Guichi in the central and southern regions, with Chaoxian having the widest and fastest spread. In various villages and towns in the fourth district of the county, more than 200 people have died from the epidemic in the past ten days. The symptoms are headache, inability to speak, followed by vomiting and diarrhea, and death within two or three days. In the jurisdiction of the third district, not only have human disasters not ended, but also six animals such as pigs and cattle have suffered from yellow diarrhea, causing plague. The place where the epidemic has occurred in Guichi is in Guanqian Town in the second district. Every household in the town is suffering from diseases such as malaria, cholera, and typhoid fever, and deaths from the epidemic are heard every day. Although the local government has established epidemic prevention and medicine distribution centers, and hired medical professionals to specialize in diagnosis, the area is too large, and assistance is difficult to provide, so the infection is still severe. There are more deaths among children. According to reports, all these places are remote areas, and medical facilities are extremely lacking, and the villagers are confused by superstition, which has delayed treatment. In view of this, the Ministry of Health has specially sent doctors Feng Rulin and technical student Ying Xihong, etc., to Anhui with a large number of medicines. Since the infection in the countryside of Chaoxian is rapid, they have crossed the river from here and taken the Huainan train to provide relief, and then transferred to other places for prevention and control.</p>
<h3>Yongding River Water Level Rises Sharply; Water Level Exceeds Historical High; Leaks Have Been Found in Dikes and Embankments on Both Banks; Danger is Inevitable During the Autumn Flood Season</h3>
<p>Peiping Correspondence: The water level of the Yongding River this year has risen sharply due to the impact of the typhoon's northward attack. According to a survey report by the Huiximiao Measurement Institute on the 6th, the water mark has risen to 1 zhang and 9 hua chi, breaking historical records. Many dams have collapsed, and the water is turbulent and dangerous. After hearing the news, all parties paid great attention to it. Although the water receded slightly to 1 zhang and 6 chi by the evening of the 7th, it has not yet escaped the danger period. The reporter made a special trip to the Lugouqiao, an important point of the river, in the afternoon of the 7th to inspect it, and visited Liu Yuful, Director of the River Affairs Bureau, to inquire about everything. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The western part of Wanping County is Lugouqiao, which is only a mile away, but the sound of the turbulent river water has long entered the ears. The Yongding River is usually only a chi deep, but recently, due to the impact of typhoons and heavy rain, it has suddenly risen to 1 zhang and 9 chi, and the water is mixed with a large amount of yellow sand, small stones, branches, and other debris. The villagers are all extremely frightened and flock to the riverbank to watch. Lugouqiao, which is usually deserted, has become lively due to this. A group of children is using this natural swimming pool to swim and collect branches and other debris from the river. According to the farmers there, when the water was fierce on the 6th, the bridge holes were blocked, and the water surface was about to reach the railway, and the Pinghan traffic was almost interrupted. Fortunately, the water has receded, and the farmers are all celebrating, hoping that the water will not rise again. Liu Yuful said that this year's water level is unprecedented. Because precautions were taken in advance, although leaks were found in various sections, no villages and towns along the coast suffered disasters. Now the water has reached the Sanjiadian area, because the river surface is widened there, so the water is very stable. However, it is still the autumn flood season and has not yet escaped the danger period. It will be safe after another ten days or so if there is no major flow. The reason for the sudden rise in the river water is that the terrain of the San'an River upstream is extremely high, and the flow is very rapid when there is a large amount of water. The provincial government has allocated 20,000 yuan for emergency rescue, and the county magistrates along the coast are supervising the laborers, security teams, and garrison troops to rush to carry out flood prevention work. Liu also said that the Yongding River and the Yellow River are the two major harms in North China, and their treatment is quite difficult. The water flow is sometimes small and sometimes large. When it is small, it is almost dry, and when it is large, it is dangerous. It cannot help with transportation and often causes disasters. The water also contains a large amount of yellow sand and silt. After the water has passed, the silt is deposited on the river bed. In recent years, the river bed has been blocked by silt, resulting in a very shallow river bed, which is also the source of flooding. If you want to dredge the river, it is not only difficult to do, but even if you spend a lot of manpower, money, and time to dredge the river well, it will be blocked by silt again after a large amount of water passes through in the future. It has now been decided to implement a diversion method after the autumn flood this year, opening several branches from the river to allow the silt to enter the branch channels and reduce the amount of silt in the river. This method is being planned. In addition, in order to facilitate management, the River Affairs Bureau has specially divided the north and south banks into eight sections each, and sent personnel to guard them separately. Now that dangerous situations have occurred in the river, each section is reporting dangerous situations by telegram. In the afternoon, it has been forwarded by telegram to the Department of Construction. The original telegram said, "Continuous rain and mountain torrents have broken out. Since the 4th of this month, the river has gradually risen, reaching 64.31 meters yesterday afternoon, breaking recent records. Yesterday evening, we received a phone call from Guanting, stating that the water level at that station had decreased by another 6 chi and 4 cun, which is the same as the water level in the telegram from the North China Water Conservancy Commission. We have reported to you by telegram one after another. Immediately, we telegraphed various counties and contacted the Wanping County Government and the garrison troops nearby to prepare for special emergency rescue. The report from the first section on the south bank stated that the water in the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th numbers of this section has reached the top of the embankment, and there is flooding in many low-lying areas. The report from the sixth section stated that the 54th and 58th dangerous works in this section are all local lateral water hazards, causing the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th section dams of the 54th number and the 3rd to 9th section side dams of the 58th number to be flooded, and the soil on the dams has been washed away. A large seepage hole and two small seepage holes have also been found in the 64th number, and water has penetrated outside the dike. The report from the seventh section stated that there are three drilled holes in the middle of the 69th number and one drilled hole at the end of the 74th number. The 13th to 19th and a half sections of the 74th number side dams are uneven, ranging from two or three chi to three or four chi. The report from the first section on this bank stated that the water surface at the place where the dam is located near the Wanping Normal School has increased, and it is only a few inches away from the west wall of the school, which is extremely dangerous. The report from the sixth section stated that six leaks have appeared in the 76th number, two leaks have appeared in the 75th number, and one leak has appeared in the 78th number. The report from the eighth section stated that two drilled holes have appeared in the 92nd number and three drilled holes have appeared in the 98th number. According to the reports from these 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th sections, the low-lying parts of the dike are mostly level with the water, and they are about to overflow. We have telegraphed each section to lead the officers and soldiers and laborers to add compartments to fill the leaks, chase and compress the sack bags, and rush to pick up the son-in-law embankments, regardless of day and night, to protect the embankments as they see fit, and do their best to defend them."</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Investigation of Theft of Military Arms</h3>
<p>The sixth squad of the second platoon of the first company of the twelfth Security Brigade of this province was stationed independently in Huan'an Town in Punan, led by its squad leader. Among the soldiers in this squad was a man named Wang Yushi. Recently, a fellow villager, Ding Wenyu, came to borrow travel expenses and was allowed to stay overnight. The next morning, it was discovered that Wang Wangbao's weapon (a Mauser pistol) and Ding Wenyu had both disappeared. The matter was reported to Wu Zongjun, the commander of the second platoon of the brigade, who immediately hired a car and rushed to Punan. In Jinshanwei Town, he spotted Ding Wenyu, the gun thief. He ordered him to stop and searched him, finding a Mauser pistol on his person. The gun's serial number matched that of the one missing from the first company. Ding Wenyu was immediately taken back to headquarters. Under interrogation, he confessed that he was from Heze County, Shandong Province, and was twenty-nine years old. He intended to use the gun to borrow travel expenses from a Mr. Zhang, a wealthy man with a horse shed, to help him return to his hometown. He begged for leniency. After interrogation, Brigade Adjutant Yang, considering that the criminal dared to steal military arms, a truly heinous crime, ordered the relevant department to prepare a formal report and send it to the Third District Headquarters for strict interrogation and legal action.</p>
<h3>Wu Boyang Experiences an Unpleasant Taste</h3>
<p>The dispute over the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument at the Xiyuecheng base in Songjiang, following a ruling by the Supreme Court that the property rights belonged to Wu Boyang, led Wu to obtain permission from the District Court to hire workers to dismantle it on the 25th of last month. Afterwards, Gu Wenshi and Gao Rongqing, the main figures in the construction of the monument pavilion, believing that Wu had defiled the Father of the Nation, immediately requested Lin You堂 to write a complaint and sued Wu in court, asking for him to be punished to the full extent of the law and ordered to rebuild the monument to leave a lasting memorial. It is now known that Wu Boyang believes that Gu and Gao have damaged his reputation and has filed a lawsuit with the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The Prosecutor's Office, based on the lawsuit, issued summons yesterday morning at ten o'clock, ordering both the plaintiff and defendant to appear in court for questioning. As a result, Gu Wenbao was released on bail, and the plaintiff was ordered to return home to await further questioning. However, at around ten o'clock in the morning, when Wu Boyang and an elder from his village arrived at the District Prosecutor's Office for questioning, as they passed the courthouse entrance, Gu Wenbao took his own excrement, wrapped it in paper, and taking Wu by surprise, told Wu Guang生 that he wanted to treat him with a snack, and then immediately smeared the excrement on Wu's face, covering him completely, with the stench permeating the air. His family was immediately called by phone and came to help him clean up, but he had already enjoyed a mouthful of osmanthus flavor.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Gold Bar Unearthed in Wood Pulp</h3>
<p>In Qian Jinbao's carpentry shop in the Jiantou Longchuanbang area outside the West Gate, a partner named Li Hesheng, while having breakfast outside the back door at seven o'clock yesterday morning, suddenly saw a corner of a golden-yellow object protruding from the soil. Hesheng, seeing this, became suspicious and believed it was a gold bar. He immediately took scissors, dug away the soil, and took it out for inspection. The words "Xin Bao Cheng Yin" were engraved on it. Hesheng weighed it on a scale and found it to be over five taels. It is said that when Hesheng unearthed it, he promised to split it among three or four partners in the shop, but unexpectedly, they left without saying goodbye at noon. The partners are now searching for them separately to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Adulterer Kills Paramour with a Knife</h3>
<p>Xu Zhian, from Taizhou, made a living as a barge operator, traveling between Wuxi and Shanghai. His wife, Song, was thirty-three years old and from Benniu, Changzhou. She had three daughters. Unfortunately, Zhian died of illness in March of this year. Through an introduction, a peddler named Luo Youcheng became a boat partner. Luo was in his thirties, lived behind the Xifeng Depot near Huangbudun in this county, and had no wife. Soon, he and Xu Song lived together day and night. Before long, a relationship developed, and their feelings deepened, becoming like husband and wife. The matter was discovered by Xu's aunt, Xu Zhu, who scolded them. The other day, Xu Song's barge was loading soybeans from Benniu to Wuxi, stopping at the entrance of the Xinchangyuan Rice Shop in Beitang. Luo Youcheng went to the boat and asked Song to meet him at his home for a tryst. Song did not agree at the time. At around five o'clock in the afternoon, Luo came to the boat again, claiming that he had important matters to discuss and that she had to go. Song had no choice but to take her daughter, Jidi, and go with Luo. When they reached a remote area behind Ronghu Village, Luo suddenly pushed Song to the ground, took out a small knife, and stabbed Song three times in the neck. Blood flowed profusely, and she lost consciousness. The murderer, seeing that his goal had been achieved, fled the scene. Afterwards, the head of the neighborhood, Dong Xiuhua, carried the injured person to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Due to excessive blood loss, her life is feared to be in danger. Upon hearing this, the Fourth and Fifth Precincts of the Public Security Bureau immediately dispatched officers to investigate and pursue the murderer to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Drug Offender Investigation Bribery Case</h3>
<p>Police officer Zhang Bin of the Third Police Station of the First Branch of the Wu County Public Security Bureau previously arrested three drug offenders, Wan Binyi, etc., and seized a small package of drugs. After handing them over to the county, Wan Binyi was sent to the County Hospital for examination. On the sixth day, Zhang Jiaoru, who runs a special training school, visited Wu Huigong, the hospital director, asking for help with Wan Binyi's case, offering 60 yuan in legal tender as a gift. At the time, a note for 30 yuan in silver dollars was written and given to Director Wu. He also asked Yu Zhijian, an affairs clerk in the county government, to ask Xu Chunsheng and Zhang Zirong to intercede once, asking that the case be handled according to precedent, etc. Director Wu immediately reported this to County Magistrate Hou by telephone. County Magistrate sent Wang Yao, the head of the Fourth Section, to investigate, and Zhang Jiaoru and Yu Zhijian were taken into custody. On the seventh day, Xu Chunsheng and others were summoned for questioning. Zhang Jiaoru and Yu Zhijian were ordered to be sent to the hospital for examination. Zhang Zirong and Xu Chunsheng were detained. Wan Binyi was sent back for drug rehabilitation in another case.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Tragic Collision with Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>Fan Zhengqi, a resident of Dongtai County, made a living by operating a boat. The other day, he took 280 yuan in legal tender to Wuxi to buy wheat. While passing through Jiangyin, at around seven o'clock in the afternoon of the sixth day, the boat was sailing near Huangtiangang when it was suddenly struck by a black foreign merchant ship, causing the boat to sink. All six people on board fell into the river. Two of Fan's daughters drowned. The remaining six were rescued by the Jiangyin Sub-Customs Office and were able to survive.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Organizing the Northern Jiangsu Cotton Association</h3>
<p>More than seventy representatives of cotton merchants from various counties in northern Jiangsu Province met in Nantong. Under the chairmanship of Wu Xucheng, they resolved to organize the Northern Jiangsu Cotton Industry Association. Representatives from each county elected Wu Xuxian, Zhang Tongwu, Li Yinong, and fifteen others as executive committee members. They discussed important issues: (1) Regarding the collection of commissions, they agreed to act in unison and resolved to hand the matter over to the executive committee. (2) Regarding the Cotton Improvement Office's levy of improvement fees, one dime per stone of cotton, they expressed extreme support for the improvement, but resolved that the government should find other ways to raise the improvement fees and decided to send representatives to visit Commissioner Ge, who also heads the Cotton Improvement Office, to petition.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: County Land Administration Bureau Illegally Collects Land Price Tax</h3>
<p>Citizens Wu Dilou and others submitted a petition to the Provincial Land Administration Bureau requesting correction and cessation of the County Land Administration Bureau's illegal collection of land price tax. The original petition stated: "Petition regarding the Zhenjiang County Land Administration Bureau's illegal collection of land tax, requesting investigation and determination according to Article 3 of the Land Law Implementation Act. It is observed that the Land Law Implementation Act was implemented on March 1, 1936. Article 3 states: 'In areas where the Land Law is implemented, land administration matters that have been carried out before the implementation shall be submitted to the Central Land Administration Authority for determination according to law. Those that are deemed non-compliant shall be ordered to be corrected or stopped.' This means that if there are non-compliant matters in the land administration bureau, the higher-level authority shall determine according to the law. Now, when the Land Law Implementation Act is implemented, your bureau seems to have determined the land administration matters of the said bureau according to the law, and ordered those deemed non-compliant to be corrected or stopped, in order to demonstrate the spirit of the rule of law. Please bring to your bureau the various illegal acts of the said bureau for your review: (1) Illegal zoning; (2) Illegal valuation; (3) Illegal increases; (4) Illegal double taxation; (5) Illegal collection period; (6) Illegal surcharge," etc.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing: Public Security Bureau to Change Name</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Government, upon order from the Executive Yuan, will change the County Government's Public Security Section to the Police Bureau and the Public Security Bureaus in each district will become police stations. The county government is proceeding with the plan. The directors of the joint township construction offices are currently concurrently held by the heads of the public security bureaus in each district. This reorganization may lead to separate appointments, and it is understood that they may be renamed district offices, but this has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Belgian Minister Ji Youmu Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning, Visited Mayor Wu in the Morning to Say Goodbye, Consul-General Hosted a Luncheon, and the Mayor Hosted a Dinner in the Evening</h3>
<p>Belgian Minister to China Ji Youmu paid farewell visits to Foreign Minister Zhang and other authorities, staying in Nanjing for one day. After being hosted by Foreign Minister Zhang for dinner the previous night, he took the 11:00 PM express train back to Shanghai with the Counselor of the Embassy and Consul-General to Shanghai Tan Erfu. He arrived in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday. After getting off at the North Station, he returned to the Huamao Apartment on Baishi Road to rest. Then, at 11:00 AM, he and Tan Erfu drove to the Municipal Government to visit Mayor Wu to say goodbye. The mayor and Secretary Tang Shixuan met him and sent a guard of honor to pay tribute. They talked for 20 minutes before he left. At 12:00 noon, Tan Erfu hosted a luncheon for Ji Youmu at his official residence in the Consulate-General on Lafayet Road, inviting the President of the Belgian Chamber of Commerce, Hailshi, the Director of the Sino-Belgian Bank, Lan Bote, and all members of the consulate to attend. Mayor Wu and his wife also hosted a farewell dinner for Minister Ji and his wife at their private residence on Haige Road at 8:30 PM last night, inviting the Belgian Consul-General, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, Zhu Changnian, Yan Nanzhang, and Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun and Secretaries Geng Jiaji and Tang Shixuan and their wives to attend. The party ended at around 10:00 PM. Minister Ji also paid farewell visits to the envoys of various countries in Shanghai these past two days. This afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Sino-Belgian Friendship Association will hold a tea party at the Clement Hotel on Lafayet Road to welcome him. From 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, Minister Ji himself will host a tea party at the Consul-General's residence to entertain the Belgian community (previously mistakenly reported as entertaining people from all walks of life in China and abroad). Then, at 10:00 AM tomorrow morning, he, his wife, and children will depart on the Zhijiade ship of the Zhaohua Company, departing from China to inspect the Dutch East Indies and the situation of the consulates and overseas Chinese businesses in the Dutch East Indies, and then return home. Minister Ji, believing that the envoys of major countries in China have been promoted, suggested to his government that China and Belgium also promote their ministers to ambassadors to strengthen diplomatic relations. The two governments are currently considering and waiting for the opportunity to realize this. However, it is understood that according to the Belgian diplomatic personnel appointment regulations, all ambassadors must be over 50 years old. Since Minister Ji is not yet 50 years old, he is bound to be restricted by this. After returning home this time, he will no longer return to China to resume his post. Once the promotion is realized, the Belgian government will naturally send another ambassador. Before the new ambassador arrives, the embassy's duties will be temporarily handled by Tan Erfu.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Election News from All Circles</h3>
<p>Railway Union Begins Nominations</p>
<p>The National Assembly Representative Election Implementation Law stipulates that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions should have one representative. The union had previously been ordered by the Third District Representative Election Office of Jiangsu Province to submit a roster of all members and resumes of officers for review by the Zhenjiang General Office. The union worked overnight to prepare and submit the documents. It also received instructions from the Third District Election Office of Jiangsu Province that the railway union should nominate candidates through the executive staff of each branch. Subsequently, it received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Election General Office that the election general office had decided to adopt the method of voting by correspondence for the method of nominating candidates by the vocational group of railway employees regarding the officials of their vocational group organization, using the example of the free vocational group nomination, and attached 36 ballots, ordering them to be distributed immediately for nomination, limited to the 10th of September, and the union council will directly send them to the Zhenjiang Election General Office. The railway union is now proceeding in accordance with this order and has begun the election. It is expected that the list of candidates will be submitted to the Zhenjiang Election General Office before the 10th of this month.</p>
<p>Joint Suggestions from Various University Associations</p>
<p>More than twenty presidents of public and private universities in Shanghai held a discussion and dinner the other day, and they all expressed regret that vocational schools nationwide were not allowed to participate in the election of candidates for representatives to the National Assembly, and that it was also inappropriate to mix the teachers' associations of universities with the members of the National Education Association for elections. They specifically suggested that the Ministry of Education revise the National Assembly Representative Election Law. The public document submitted by the association to the Ministry of Education is as follows: "It has recently been seen in the newspapers that, according to the interpretation of the General Office for the Election of National Assembly Representatives, vocational schools are not included in the list of free vocational groups in the professional election. Upon hearing this, everyone was suspicious, and they all believed that vocational schools also belong to higher education, and the term "schools above vocational level" has been commonly used, and they are classified as the same stage as independent colleges and universities. There are dozens of public and private vocational schools across the country, and they should enjoy the same treatment as independent colleges and universities. Furthermore, according to the provisions of Article 18 of the professional election on the number of representatives, according to the attached Table 4, the number of representatives from the educational associations, national universities, independent colleges, and teachers' associations of universities and independent colleges registered by the Ministry of Education is 18. The number of members of the educational associations is in the tens of thousands, which is quite different from the number of teachers in public and private universities and independent colleges. Mixed elections are inappropriate. Teachers from schools above vocational level should elect a certain number of representatives to the National Assembly themselves. We have always looked up to your department for its concern for higher education and teachers' rights. All the reasons for which we request that the National Assembly Representative Election Law be amended have been duly prepared and are hereby submitted to your department for review, and we would be grateful if you would promptly forward it to the General Office for the Election of National Assembly Representatives for their consideration. We are extremely eager to await your response. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Education, Shanghai each."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance, Legal Tender Should Be Accepted Universally, Without Restrictions Based on Place Name on the Bill</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, It is hereby observed that since the currency reform, the banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China have been designated as legal tender, regardless of the place name printed on the banknote, as long as it is not a counterfeit, it should be accepted universally in order to achieve the effect of currency unification. According to reports from merchants and citizens in this city, recently, banknotes of the Central Bank of China in Shanghai with the words "Chongqing" printed on them have been rejected by small merchants and tobacco shops in an attempt to gain small profits, which hinders the credibility of legal tender and inconveniences citizens. We hereby cable to you to request that your ministry investigate and promptly instruct the municipal authorities of this city and the provinces and cities to issue a bulletin stating that the legal tender of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Farmers Bank of China should be accepted universally regardless of the place name printed on them, in order to emphasize currency unification, which is the common sentiment. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows in reverence."</p>
<p>Guangdong Finance Office Successfully Borrows Two Million Yuan from the Bank of Communications and Other Banks, Using Provincial Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Revenue as Collateral, Each Shanghai Head Office Has Approved the Guangdong Branch to Transfer the Funds</p>
<p>The Xinsheng She reported that Song Ziliang, Special Commissioner of Guangdong and Director of the Finance Office, to reorganize the finances of Guangdong Province, continued to discuss borrowing two million yuan from the Bank of Communications and eight other banks, using the tobacco and alcohol stamp tax revenue as collateral, and has been successful and signed a contract. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Previous Loan Already Released in Three Installments</p>
<p>At the end of July, the Guangdong Finance Office, to reorganize its finances, borrowed six million yuan from the Central, Bank of Communications, and Three Banks, using the provincial consolidated tax revenue as collateral. After the agreement was reached, the funds were released in four installments. Three installments have already been released, totaling 4.5 million yuan. The fourth installment of 1.5 million yuan is scheduled to be released on September 15th, all directly released by the Guangzhou branches of the above three banks. Before the establishment of the Central Bank branch in Guangzhou, it was entrusted to the Bank of China.</p>
<p>Another Loan of Two Million Yuan Successful</p>
<p>The Guangdong Finance Office is now borrowing another two million yuan from eight banks: the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, the Zhongnan Bank, the Jincheng Bank, the Yanye Bank, the China National Products Bank, and the Guohua Bank. After Special Commissioner Song negotiated with the managers of the Guangzhou branches of the above banks, it was agreed that the loan would be secured by the provincial tobacco and alcohol stamp tax revenue, with a monthly interest rate of 0.9% and a term of one year. The branches have applied to their Shanghai head offices for approval and will sign the loan contract immediately.</p>
<p>Each Bank Individually Acknowledges the Loan to be Released by Guangzhou</p>
<p>Each bank acknowledges the amount of the loan: the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications each acknowledge 275,000 yuan, the China National Products Bank 600,000 yuan, the Guohua Bank 200,000 yuan, the Shanghai Bank 250,000 yuan, the Zhongnan Bank 150,000 yuan, and the Yanye Bank and the Jincheng Bank each acknowledge 125,000 yuan, totaling two million yuan. As for the method of releasing the funds, the Guangzhou branches of the above banks will directly release them to the Guangdong Finance Office, University Federation, August 31st.</p>
<p>Jiang Gonghui and Other Associations Compete for Quotas</p>
<p>The Guomin She reported that the first-class crew members in the transportation industry in this city have recently noted that the National Assembly Election Office has allowed the second-class crew member groups, such as the Seamen's Union, to nominate representatives to attend the conference in accordance with the Occupational Group Election Law, while the first-class crew member groups such as the Jiang Gonghui Dispatcher's Guild are not allowed to nominate representatives in accordance with the Occupational Group Election Law, which is quite unsatisfactory. Therefore, last month, the Jiang Gonghui Dispatcher's Guild, the Driver's Guild, the Engine Mechanics Association, the Wireless Electricity Association, and the Maritime Drivers Association each nominated one representative to go to Beijing the other day to petition the National Election General Office, strongly arguing for the number of representatives to the National Assembly.</p>
<h3>President Sun Returned to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke took the opportunity to come to Shanghai last Saturday to rest and visited national party elders such as Yun Lie, etc. After staying for four days, he took the 11:00 PM express train back to Nanjing last night to resume his duties.</p>
<h3>Before the Implementation of the Transportation and Marketing Regulations, Goods Can Be Purchased</h3>
<h3>Exemption from Adoption, But Those Suspected of Smuggling Shall Still Be Dealt With in Accordance With Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued an instruction to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: "It is hereby decided that in the instruction No. 19891 of the Municipal Government, it is stated that in the consultation No. 46541 of the Ministry of Industry, it is stated that in the consultation No. 28659 of the Ministry of Finance, it is observed that the Ministry has previously distributed the Temporary Regulations on Punishing Smuggling and Tax Evasion and the Temporary Regulations on Inspecting the Transportation and Marketing of Imported Goods to various provinces for reference in order to strictly combat smuggling. Subsequently, it was approved that the goods seized in various provinces were mostly purchased before the implementation of the Transportation and Marketing Regulations. Should they be punished? They have sent telegrams requesting a response from the Ministry. It is now stipulated that goods purchased by inland merchants before the implementation of the Transportation and Marketing Regulations will not be subject to the provisions of the Transportation and Marketing Regulations. However, if there are large quantities of goods that the Customs deems to be suspected of smuggling, the Customs may investigate and deal with them in accordance with the Anti-Smuggling Regulations. In addition to the distribution, a corresponding consultation is requested for reference and compliance. In addition to the distribution, a corresponding order is hereby issued to the bureau to immediately comply with the distribution for reference. It is ordered that the association inform all industries for reference. This order."</p>

<h3>Municipal Party and Government Jointly Proclaim to Labor and Management That They Must Not Suspend Business or Strike Without Authorization, and If There Are Any Disputes, They Should Apply for Mediation, and If They Continue to Violate, They Will Be Investigated in Accordance with the Law</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee and the Municipal Social Bureau jointly issued Proclamation No. 1105 yesterday, stating: "It is hereby observed that the industry of our country is backward and needs to catch up quickly. Although there are countless ways to revitalize it, the coordination of labor and management is a necessary condition. Therefore, the bureau and the society have repeatedly emphasized the importance of mutual understanding and cooperation to overcome difficulties together. If both labor and management have disagreements due to minor matters and do not apply for mediation or arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Labor Dispute Handling Law, and suddenly suspend business or strike, such direct actions will not only destroy the industry and hinder livelihoods, but also affect social order and disrupt law and discipline. The bureau and the society have repeatedly declared this to be strictly prohibited. However, this has been ignored for a long time, and recent disputes have gradually increased. A joint proclamation is hereby urgently issued to reiterate the prohibition. The labor and management in this city shall abide by this proclamation. If there are any disputes, they shall first send representatives to directly and peacefully negotiate. If the matter cannot be resolved, they shall apply to the bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. If the factory shuts down or goes out of business without going through the mediation or arbitration process, or if the workers go on strike or work slowly without authorization, once it is verified, they will be investigated in accordance with the law without any leniency. Be careful and do not neglect this important matter. Signed on September 8, 1936, by Executive Director Bai, Pan Gongzhan, and Acting Director Pan Gongzhan."</p>
<h3>Du Chongyuan Regained Freedom Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Du Chongyuan, the person in charge of the Xinsheng Weekly, was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment by the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court on July 9 of last year for the crime of obstructing foreign relations. He was sent to prison to serve his sentence. He was detained in Caohejing Prison. Later, due to illness, he requested bail and was transferred to Hongqiao Sanatorium by the Second Branch of the High Court, where he was guarded by police officers from the Public Security Bureau. He was released from prison yesterday upon the expiration of his term. A large number of people went to the hospital to welcome him at 11:00 AM yesterday, but he politely declined. The following is a transcript of his announcement: "Chongyuan's prison term has expired, and he has regained his freedom on September 8. I have been in prison for more than a year, and I am very grateful for the concern of all circles. Due to a slight indisposition, I must go to the countryside for recuperation immediately after my release from prison, and I will not be able to thank you in person. I hereby report this to you and ask for your forgiveness."</p>
<h3>This Month's Third Day Hurricane Invasion - Multiple Breaches in the Gaoqiao East Embankment - Zhao Shiqi and Others Request Planning for Prevention - Existing Breaches to be Repaired Imminently</h3>
<p>Due to the hurricane invasion on the third day of this month, the Gaoqiao East Embankment suffered multiple breaches and is extremely dangerous. Residents of the area, including Zhao Shiren, are appealing to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to organize immediate repairs. The appeal states that on the third day of this month, a hurricane swept through Shanghai, and the tide surged violently, causing extensive damage to the East Embankment. The embankment faces in Lier and other sections are almost entirely broken, with successive breaches and water flowing in. Fortunately, the wind direction changed immediately, averting a major disaster. Otherwise, it would have been dire. In light of unpredictable autumn floods and tides, the East Embankment is always at risk of danger. Previously, when under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, the Gaoqiao Township Office was responsible for hiring laborers to pile up mud bags to address emergencies. Since coming under the administration of the Bureau, a special Embankment Works Management Office was established. If emergency repairs were needed, the Management Office would handle them accordingly. However, the Management Office has now been abolished. With the autumn flood season just beginning, if another hurricane strikes and high tides rage, the existing breaches will not have been repaired. If the already weakened embankment collapses further, how can emergency protection be carried out? Furthermore, the Bureau is far away across the Huangpu River, and transportation will inevitably be disrupted, making it impossible to provide assistance. The degree of danger is such that it may become unmanageable. Citizens, considering this, feel deeply uneasy. They implore the Bureau to promptly plan for prevention, so that there is no panic in emergencies, and the danger can be prevented from escalating. They also request that the existing breaches be repaired imminently to protect the embankment and safeguard the lives of the people.</p>

<h3>The Hujia and Sujia Roads are Open to Traffic - Opening Ceremony Scheduled for October 1st - Supplementary Opening Ceremony to be Held</h3>
<p>Long-distance buses traveling directly from Huzhou to Suzhou and Jiaxing have been in operation for half a month. There are as many as ten train trips between Shanghai and Suzhou every day. From Shanghai to Suzhou, passengers can transfer to long-distance buses on the Sujia Road to Wujiang, Beita, Pingwang, Zhenze, Nanxun, Huzhou, and from Pingwang to Shengze, Wangjiangjing, Shuangqiao, Jiaxing, etc., all of which can be reached in a short time. The entire route is flat, and the company has thoroughly repaired it. The vehicles are newly built, so they can arrive on time, making them faster than other vehicles. The station staff at each station provides attentive service, and it is very convenient to carry luggage. It is truly the most important route connecting Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. There are eight local buses with sixteen round trips, and more than forty regular buses. Small chartered cars for everyday use and more than twenty large and small stations are all available for telephone calls. In the future, the joint transportation of goods will be actively pursued, which will prove the completeness of the paper weaving of the two roads. We must also invite all transportation bureaus to change the Shanghai-Suzhou long-distance service to a short-distance passenger service. If there are even large towns connected on both sides of the road, there are more than twenty towns such as Shuanglin Wuzhen, Lianshi, Xinshi, Shanzhen, Zhili, Yigao, Linghu, Dibao, Yuanjiahui, Xia'ang, and Luohe. Furthermore, to reach small towns and villages and the Seventy-Two Tower Ports, there are no less than two hundred places.

<h3>British and American Three Factories - Workers Decide to Resume Work This Morning - Demands Waiting to be Resolved According to Law - Party and Government Agencies Hold Second Mediation</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports that all 2,200 workers of the Third Factory of the British American Tobacco Company (i.e., Yizhong Tobacco Company) on Shutaopeng Road in Shanghai, due to opposing the oppression of workers by Manager Wei Ziqian, triggered a general strike on August 18. In the past ten days, the attitudes of both sides have become increasingly antagonistic. Although the Social Bureau has mediated according to the law, the capitalists have refused to attend, resulting in no resolution. In order to consider the livelihood of the workers and maintain local safety, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions specially dispatched Standing Committee members Zhou Xuexiang, Zhang Kechang, Ye Xianggao, Lu Muqin, and Hu Menglin, together with the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, to Yangshupu at 2:00 p.m. yesterday to convene representatives of workers from various departments of the factory. After giving earnest advice on the current situation, the representatives listened to the advice of the Federation of Trade Unions and expressed their acceptance. They notified all workers in groups overnight and decided to resume work in the factory this morning.</p>
<p>Order to Resume Work</p>
<p>The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions immediately issued Instruction No. 31, stating: "For the purpose of following orders, in the case of the Yizhong Tobacco Factory (i.e., British American Tobacco Company) dismissing workers without reason, causing a strike, the workers have repeatedly presented requests for assistance to the Federation. The Federation feels that the workers have suffered unreasonable oppression, which is truly pitiful. However, at this time of great difficulty and deepening national crisis, the order in the rear should be maintained. In addition to dispatching personnel to give earnest advice, it is urgently ordered that the workers resume work in the near future and wait for the Party and government to resolve the matter. The Federation has high hopes." This order is issued by Chairman Zhu Xuefan, Standing Committee members Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xiangfu, Zhang Kechang, Li Mengnan, Shao Xubai, and Long Peiyun.</p>
<p>Second Mediation</p>
<p>It is now known that the Party and government agencies of this city, in order to resolve the British and American labor dispute as soon as possible, have specifically scheduled to convene the labor and capital sides for a second mediation at 9:00 a.m. today. If the mediation fails to establish, it will be submitted to the Municipal Government Arbitration Committee for arbitration according to the law.</p>
<h3>Solicitation of National Day Lyrics and Sheet Music - Extended Deadline - Extended to September 15th</h3>

Yesterday, they jointly announced that the deadline for submission would be extended to the 15th. The original text stated: "Regarding the deadline for soliciting National Day and National Flag lyrics and sheet music for raising and lowering the flag, it was previously set to end at the end of June and was announced in the newspaper.

<h3>Suggestions from the Commercial Commissioner to the Dutch East Indies - Key Points for Improving Export Products - Trade Values Were Equal in the Past - Hope that We Can Develop Technically</h3>
<p>The economic structures of our country and the Dutch East Indies are almost the same in nature. Therefore, although the possibility of trade development between the two is not great in terms of value, it is also not much in terms of variety. If our country can make considerable progress in technical industry, the industrial manufactured products it can supply to the Dutch East Indies will be more than what it can supply today. The following is a report on Sino-Dutch commercial conditions from Xu Tinglie, our country's Commercial Commissioner to the Dutch East Indies:</p>
<p>Import and Export Comparison The types and amounts of imports and exports of goods between our country and the Dutch East Indies are compared as follows. In 1935, China's important export commodities included: (1) animals and animal products (excluding raw hides, finished hides, leather goods, and fish, shellfish, and marine products), totaling 37,021 tons; (2) raw hides, finished hides, and leather goods, totaling 2.67 holes tons; grains and products, totaling 6,107 tons; (3) oil, none; (4) seeds and kernels, totaling 8,126 tons; (5) tea, totaling 20,392 tons; tobacco, totaling 272,112 tons. The Dutch East Indies' important export commodities included: (1) rubber, totaling 134,000 tons; (2) tea, 14,000 tons; (3) sugar, 18,845,000 tons; (4) tobacco, none; (5) coffee, totaling 26,000 tons; (6) camphor, totaling 161,000 tons; (7) copper skin and copper ore, none; (8) oil and main products, totaling 5,500,000 tons. From the above observations, some of our country's main products exported to the Dutch East Indies may have a monopoly in the Dutch East Indies market, and some have already been introduced to the Dutch East Indies and are expected to successfully monopolize in the future.</p>
<p>Export Improvement The goods that should be improved for our country's exports to the Dutch East Indies include: (1) matches, the quality is inferior to that of Sweden, but better than those made in Japan, and the price is cheaper than European matches, not far from Japanese matches; (2) tea, the quality of our country's non-smoked tea is quite excellent in quality, but the market is extremely limited, our country's smoked flower tea is better than the well-known Taiwanese counterpart, the price of Chinese smoked flower tea competes with Taiwanese smoked flower tea, but is higher than Taiwanese and Dutch East Indies mixed smoked flower tea; (3) unbleached cotton goods, the quality is generally very good, comparable to the better products in Japan, the price is too expensive compared with Japanese goods; (4) colored cotton fabrics, the quality of some is good or just passable, some are too poor, the price is still relatively high compared with Japanese products; (5) silk, the quality is good, but often fades, the price is higher compared with the price of Japanese rayon fabrics and mixed rayon and natural silk fabrics, or rayon and cotton interweaving fabrics; (6) cotton yarn, the quality is good, at least equal to that made by Japan, the value is too high; (7) cement, the quality is good, the value must be competitive under the current limited system; (8) carpets, the quality is good, the price is higher than the average of European machine-made carpets, but lower than the products of Persia and Turkey; (9) ink, the quality of some brands is very good, some are not satisfactory, the price must be competitive; (10) paint, the quality is good, the price must be competitive; (11) flashlight batteries, the quality is good, the price is too high; (12) Shandong manchu silk, the quality is good, the price is still cheap, quite popular.</p>

<h3>When Transshipping Taxed Goods - A Permit is Still Required</h3>
<p>The New Medicine Association sent a letter to its members yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir/Madam, we have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, which in turn received a proclamation No. 1541 from the Jianghai Customs, stating: 'The interim regulations for inspecting the transportation and sales of imported goods were announced in proclamation No. 1521 on June 23 of this year. Now, according to the order of the Ministry of Finance, the provisions of Articles 2, 3, and 6 of the aforementioned transportation and sales regulations should be interpreted as follows: For taxed goods (i.e., goods that should apply for a transportation and sales license) that are transported by sea or river from the original port of entry to another port, if they have not obtained a transportation and sales license, they should apply to the Customs (i.e., the Customs of the other port) for a transportation and sales license in accordance with Article 2 of the transportation and sales regulations if they need to be transported to other places for distribution from that other port. If they are transported from the original port of entry to various places by train, inland river vessels, civilian ships, or automobiles and have already obtained a transportation and sales license, they should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of the transportation and sales regulations if they need to be transported to other places for distribution. Merchants should be informed accordingly.' Therefore, we have sent a letter to inform you and hope you will take note accordingly."</p>
<h3>Dr. Pang Jingzhou Returns Home</h3>
<p>Dr. Pang Jingzhou has been serving in the medical education field in Shanghai for many years. Last autumn, he was ordered by the Ministry of Education to go to Europe and the United States for inspection. He returned to China from the United States on the 7th of the previous day. In an interview, he stated: "I took an Italian mail ship abroad on this day last year and traveled to a total of fifteen countries, including Germany, France, Russia, Austria, England, and the United States, for exactly one year. The main task was to investigate the equipment and new trends in modern medical education. I stayed in Germany for a relatively long time, because I had lived in Hamburg to do private research, and I also helped the University of Frankfurt run the folklore museum of the Chinese Academy. During the trip in Europe, except for taking a plane to Moscow, I traveled by car, covering more than 12,000 miles of highway. Therefore, I was able to get a glimpse of the rural facilities of various countries. I arrived in the United States in early July and stayed in New York and Washington. Soon after, I chose to travel east and stopped along the way for sightseeing. In the middle of last month, I finally took the route to the West Xian De Wharf and returned home. I once drafted a book on medical education and travel notes, which are stored in my luggage and will be sorted out and published later."</p>
<h3>Memorial Service for Living Buddha Nuona - Soliciting Articles to Commemorate Loyalty and Martyrdom</h3>
<p>Nuona Hutuktu, a candidate for the Central Executive Committee and Pacification Commissioner of Xikang, passed away in Garze a month ago. Because the Central Government considers Nuona to have sacrificed himself for the country, it has ordered the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and other agencies to hold a memorial service. It is now known that the commission has consulted with the Nuona Office in Beijing and decided to hold the service in Beijing on the 30th of this month. It also sent letters to various circles yesterday, inviting them to participate or write inscriptions to commend his loyalty and martyrdom. The original letter stated: "Reverently, Nuona Hutuktu, the leader of politics and religion in Xikang, served as a candidate for the Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee, a commissioner of the Military Commission specially appointed to pacify Xikang, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and a member of the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee. Throughout his life, he sincerely supported the Han people and assisted in politics. Last year, he was ordered to return to Kang and traveled to various places to appease the people of Kang, feeling grateful for unity and resisting the Communist bandits. He repeatedly fought fiercely until his strength was exhausted and aid was cut off. He was captured but unyielding. On May 12 of this year, he sacrificed himself for the country at the age of 73. He showed auspicious signs at the time of his death, which were witnessed by all. The government has issued a decree to commend him and ordered the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and this office to prepare for a memorial service. We sincerely request you to inscribe a portrait to commend his loyalty and martyrdom so as to last forever. We hope you will grant it as soon as possible so that it can be paid to Xinyun."</p>

<h3>Ceylon Xuefa Delegation Receives Bhikkhu Ordination: Ordination Platform Set Up in the River, More Than Five Thousand Visitors</h3>
<p>The members of the Ceylon Xuefa (Study Dharma) Delegation organized by the Shanghai Chinese Buddhist Association, Hui Song, Xiu Lu, Wei Huan, Wei Zhi, Fa Zhou, and others, set sail in April of this year.</p>

<p>To study Southern Buddhism and other matters, as reported in the newspapers. After the delegation arrived in Ceylon, they were warmly welcomed by the local people. On the Buddha's Birthday in May of this year, they first received the novice monk ordination. Thousands of people attended the ceremony, a rare event in history. Their teacher specially bestowed upon them Dharma names, the same as the Dharma names of the five monks first converted by the Buddha, expressing deep expectations. In the past few months, they have been studying Sanskrit, Pali, English, and Sangha precepts with Master Naluoda, making rapid progress. Yesterday, the Shanghai Buddhist Pure Land Karma Society received</p>
<p>A Report From The Delegation</p>

<h3>Strange Insects in the River at North Gaoqiao, Pudong: About an Inch Long, All Colors Available, Health Bureau is Eliminating Them</h3>
<p>The river at North Gaoqiao in Pudong (also known as Jiebang) is the largest river in the area, with constant boat traffic. However, the residents there usually do not know about sanitation and arbitrarily throw garbage, feces, and dead cats and dogs into the river. Although the Health Bureau has previously posted signs strictly prohibiting this, it has not been effective. Therefore, a strange insect has recently been found in the river, about an inch long, everywhere. Red, yellow, blue, white, and black colors are all available, and they are as numerous as tadpoles in spring. A few days ago, a worker named Jia got thirsty and took water from the river to quench his thirst. Unexpectedly, he immediately vomited and diarrhea, and the above-mentioned strange insects were also found in the diarrhea. It was then known to be poisonous. Fortunately, he was immediately treated by a doctor and escaped the danger of death. At present, the residents there are quite frightened by this. Therefore, the Health Bureau has come forward to inspect and find ways to eliminate it, while strictly prohibiting the throwing of garbage and other filth into the river.</p>
<h3>Woman Huang Butian Sues Zhu Ziyun, Claims Relationship With Zhu, Court Mediation Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>Zhu Ziyun, a traditional Chinese medicine doctor residing at No. 447 Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou, has a thriving practice. Recently, Huang Budai, a Shanghai woman (45 years old), hired lawyer Sha Xunyi to file a lawsuit in the civil mediation office of the First Special District Court, requesting a summons for mediation to confirm that Zhu Ziyun's daughter, Zhu Amao, was born to her and Zhu. The facts she stated were that the petitioner, Huang Budai, was the daughter of the deceased famous doctor Huang Xiaochu. When the petitioner was fourteen years old, Zhu Ziyun went to her father to learn medicine, residing there. Therefore, the petitioner and Zhu Ziyun had a very good relationship, like siblings. Zhu once proposed marriage to the petitioner, but was rejected. Later, the petitioner married Shi Xiugang, but her husband died after a few years. She returned to her mother's house. Zhu Ziyun came to seduce her from time to time, restating his old request, vowing to grow old together. The petitioner was fooled and lived together in Shihua Lane, Hongkou. Soon, she gave birth to a daughter, named Amao (now an adult, also listed as the second petitioner), who was taken back by Zhu for upbringing. Afterwards, Zhu changed his attitude. After negotiations, Zhu began to provide living expenses of two to three hundred yuan per month. Initially, the petitioner and Amao visited each other several times a year, but recently Zhu prohibited Amao from interacting with the petitioner and stopped paying living expenses. The petitioner entrusted lawyer Yao Yongli to send a letter for negotiation, while Zhu entrusted lawyer Lu Qi to reply, absolutely denying any relationship with the petitioner. Therefore, lawyer Sha filed a mediation request, requesting confirmation that Zhu Amao was her biological daughter and cessation of his abuse of rights, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei of the First Special District Court opened the Civil Court No. 11 to summon mediation. Zhu Ziyun hired lawyer Lu Qi to appear as his representative. After lawyer Sha presented the reasons for Huang Butian's request, lawyer Lu rose to respond, absolutely denying the facts stated by the petitioner, saying that Zhu Ziyun and the petitioner were fellow apprentices. When the petitioner was a widow in her mother's house, she suddenly had a child, Amao, who was not tolerated by her husband's family. Zhu Ziyun devised a plan to send Amao to his in-laws, the Ma family, for upbringing. This was entirely a matter of morality. Even Amao's marriage to the Zhang family was presided over by the Ma family, with gift lists and other evidence to prove it. Therefore, the petitioner's allegations were entirely castles in the air, etc. The court inquired whether there was any possibility of settlement. Lawyer Lu immediately stated that it was absolutely impossible, etc. Judge Wang then declared the mediation unsuccessful and instructed the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit separately. It is reported that Amao was once engaged to the third son of a prominent figure in Shanghai, Mr. Wei, but the engagement was dissolved for some reason. Now she has married into the Zhang family.</p>
<h3>Poor Daughter-in-Law Painfully Abandons Her Sick Child: Municipal Council and Court Have No Relief Measures</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports: Last Thursday night, a Chinese woman abandoned her nine-year-old paralyzed son on the steps in front of Renji Hospital on Shandong Road. This incident has left the police authorities of the Municipal Council and officials of the First Special District Court in a quandary, with no precedent to follow. In other words, there is no precedent to follow. The court cannot now send the child to a hospital or charitable organization in the Public Concession or the Greater Shanghai Municipality for treatment, because the major charitable organizations in the Concession are not under the jurisdiction of the First Special District Court. Therefore, taking in the sick child is not a matter that the court can decide, but should be decided by the hospital or other similar organizations, or by the Municipal Council. Although this matter has been reported to the court, it has not been judged. The sick child is currently temporarily taken in by the police, but the police authorities are eager to determine a solution so that they can be relieved of the burden of caring for the child. The child cannot move from the waist down and needs constant medical treatment. The police believe that the child's future life will depend on the public. The whereabouts of the mother are currently unknown. Although the child can speak, he cannot tell the police where his mother is or her usual residence. The child's clothes are tattered. When he was found that day, there was a note on his clothes that read: the child's father is dead, and the mother is destitute, so she cannot afford the child's medical expenses. Now she is abandoning him on the steps of your hospital, hoping that the doctors will do good deeds and treat him properly. If he can be cured, she will do her best to save the wages she earns to repay their labor, etc. The note was not signed. The hospital staff took the child in and reported it to the police. The police immediately formally applied to the court for disposal, which ordered the child to be sent to a certain nursery in the Xinzha district. The nursery refused, saying that it was currently repairing the building and could not take him in. The child was then cared for by the police and the court again. Major foreign charitable hospitals in the Concession are unwilling to take in the child, setting a precedent, and wish to have the matter resolved by the judicial authorities. Logically speaking, if the mother is found to reside in the Public Concession, then the responsibility may be borne by the Municipal Council. If she is a resident of Zhabei or Nanshi, then the Chinese authorities should bear the responsibility. However, it is heard that the Municipal Council is unwilling to assume this obligation, believing that if this precedent is set, other disabled people will flock to it. The Municipal Council has not prepared the funds to support such people.</p>
<h3>Student Attempts Suicide and is Rescued: Was it Due to Missing the Exam or Economic Pressure?</h3>
<p>The Daxin Hotel on North Zhejiang Road, Zhabei, had a traveler named Chen Xingji who checked in the night before last. He was 25 years old, from Hubei, and had graduated from Hubei Middle School. He came to Shanghai with two classmates, A and B, to take the entrance exam for Shanghai's Great China University. They had already registered and obtained admission tickets. However, Chen and others were overly nervous, fearing that Great China University would not accept them. Therefore, they discussed with classmates A and B and decided to go to the capital to take the entrance exam for Yuling University. However, A and B had already taken the train to Beijing, leaving Chen alone in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, yesterday at noon, the hotel tea boy suspected something was wrong when he did not see Chen get up. He went to the bedside to call him, only to find that the traveler was unconscious and pale. Knowing that he had taken poison, he immediately ran to report to the Tianbao Lane police station of the Mongol Road Police Station. The police were dispatched to send the traveler to Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road. After the doctor ordered Chen to vomit the poison, it was identified as a poisonous substance resembling calming powder, etc. Due to the lack of testing equipment, it was not identified. Later, the poisoned man gradually recovered. He called the police station, and the Chen Xingji was taken away for disposal.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaosan is Severely Injured in a Chopping: Xiao Zifan Surrenders Himself, Denies Any Involvement in the Attack</h3>
<p>A notorious gangster, Ding Xiaodi from Changshu, nicknamed Xiao Zifan (Little Rice Cake), is quite powerful in the Xinzha area and has many disciples. Last month, Chen Zhengguang, residing at No. 373, Lane 568, Xinzha Road, introduced his tenant, Wang Xiaosan, to Ding Xiaodi as a disciple (commonly known as "Old Man"). Until the night before last, Wang Xiaosan was suddenly beaten by Xiao Zifan and five others, including pig butcher A Quan and A Hui, near his residence for unknown reasons. Unexpectedly, at about 8:00 am the day before yesterday, when Wang Xiaosan was still in bed, Xiao Zifan and the other five barged in. Xiao Zifan covered Wang's mouth and ordered the other four to attack with knives, causing Wang to be stabbed four times in the right leg and once in the left leg. He bled profusely and moaned in bed. The murderers fled in a panic. Later, the cohabiting tenant, Mrs. Chen Wu, heard the commotion and saw two puddles of blood on the ground next to Wang's bed. She realized that he had been injured and immediately reported it to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detectives Tao Ruye and Yang Yunfeng to transport Wang to Baolong Hospital for treatment. They also went to arrest Xiao Zifan, Ding Xiaodi, at his home, but could not find him. Before long, Ding Xiaodi surrendered himself to the police station and was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Liu Baolian prosecuted him for the crime of injury under Article 277 of the Criminal Code, and stated the above situation, saying that the victim, Wang Xiaosan, was still being treated in the hospital and could not appear in court today, requesting a postponement. He also presented witnesses Chen Zhengguang and Mrs. Chen Wu to testify to everything. In conclusion, the defendant, Ding Xiaodi, confessed that Wang Xiaosan was in the duck blood soup business, and his father and he were rice cake sellers, hence the nickname Xiao Zifan. Recently, Wang Xiaosan set up an oil tofu stall next to his rice cake stall. Yesterday morning, after he returned home, he heard his wife say that he had stabbed Wang Xiaosan. But because he had not done so, he surrendered himself to the police station. Judge Zhan Liangzai verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for further questioning in seven days.</p>
<h3>A Dance Hostess Accuses Him of Seduction and Rape: Huang Qiluan Disappears, Lu Bin and Yu Ying Testify to What They Saw, Girl Goes to Hotel for Revelry After Getting Drunk at the Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Zou Lou, a local woman residing at No. 115 Ruifu Lane, Tangjia Lane, recently accompanied by her sixteen-year-old daughter, Zou Cuifei, hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special District Court against Huang Qiluan, a student at Jiangwan Yuqing Middle School, and Lu Bin, a Cantonese, and Yu Ying, Lu's lover and a dancer at the Shunfeng Dance Hall, for hindering public morals, requesting that they be punished in accordance with Articles 221 and 227 of the Criminal Code, and attaching a civil suit, ordering the three defendants to be jointly and severally liable for compensation of 10,000 yuan, etc. Zou Cuifei had been a dancer at the</p>
<p>Shunfeng Dance Hall</p>
<p>on North Sichuan Road. On March 30 of this year, Huang and Lu went to the Shunfeng Dance Hall to dance. Until 5:00 am the next morning, after being tired of dancing, they invited Yu Ying and Zou Cuifei to the Lanting Restaurant, where they plied Zou with alcohol until she was drunk, and then lured her into a room at the Hongkou Hotel, where she was raped by Huang Qijian. Afterwards, Huang used this as an excuse to avoid Zou. In anger, Zou attempted suicide by taking poison, but failed. Her mother found out about it, so she filed a lawsuit. The case has been summoned by the Special District Court once, but because the three defendants did not arrive, it was ordered to be</p>
<p>rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<p>The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Xiao took the seat in the Second Criminal Court for further questioning. Lu Bin and Yu Ying arrived as summoned, but Huang Qiluan did not arrive. His lawyer appeared on his behalf, stating that Huang Qiluan had now disappeared and his whereabouts were unknown. His cousin, Li Delin, had received a letter from Huang, saying that he had fled. Huang's parents only learned that their son had been sued after reading the newspaper, so they entrusted their lawyer to appear in court and state this, etc. Then, Lu Bin testified, 24 years old, Cantonese, residing at No. 34 Chang'an Lane, Xinji Hong Road, formerly worked at the Rihuo Foreign Firm, and now</p>
<p>is unemployed at home.</p>
<p>Yu Ying is my fiancée and is a dancer at the Shunfeng Dance Hall. Although we have a relationship, we still live separately. Huang Qiluan was met at the dance hall. At 1:30 am on the night of March 30 of this year, I went to the Shunfeng Dance Hall. Huang was dancing with another dancer, which I found strange, because Huang was usually very friendly with the dancer Zou Cuifei and always danced with her. Why was he suddenly dancing with another dancer today? I questioned Huang, who said that Zou was going to the Far East Dance Hall to dance tea, and Huang had advised her against it, but she would not listen, so they</p>
<p>had different opinions.</p>
<p>At that time, Zou Cuifei was also jealous and angry. She drank beer wildly alone at the wine rack. After my persuasion, at about 5:00 am at dawn, in addition to Huang and me and Yu Ying and Zou Cuifei, there were also dancers Xinbao and Zou's cousin Jinmei, etc., who went to the Lanting Restaurant for snacks, intending to take the opportunity to reconcile Huang and Zou. Unexpectedly, Zou collapsed at the table and babbled, appearing drunk, saying to Huang Qiluan, "Ah Huang, I can never leave you," and other unseemly language. I assumed Zou</p>
<p>was already drunk,</p>
<p>so I ordered Yu Ying to send her home. So I hired a car. Unexpectedly, Zou suddenly said that if she went home at this time, she would be scolded by her parents, so she did not want to go back. Therefore, she had to go to the Hongkou Hotel to open a room for a little rest. As soon as she entered the room, Zou lay across the bed. Because it was already 6:00 am, I opened another room with Miss Yu to rest together, so that I could go to my job at 8:30 am. At about 8:00 am, Huang and Zou came to my room together,</p>
<p>looking very happy.</p>
<p>Before long, they parted ways. I do not know what happened afterwards. But whether Huang and Zou have a relationship, I still do not know, etc. Yu Ying also testified to the same thing as Lu, her testimony was similar to Lu's. Under the debate of the two parties, Judge Zhong concluded the debate on Lu Bin and Yu Ying's part and will render a judgment on the 15th of this month. The trial of Huang Qiluan's part is temporarily suspended.</p>

<h3>Removing the Mezzanine to Make a Floor: Accusation of Thief Destroying the House: Sleeping on the Plank and Climbing onto the Bed: Zhou Chengxiang Files a Lawsuit Out of Resentment</h3>
<p>Zhou Chengxiang, the owner of the Zhou Xiangtai Meat Shop at No. 19 Xu Zhen Road, Xujiahui, Shanghai, hired lawyer Shen Yong to file a lawsuit in the local court against Xie Qingbai, the warden of the Second Special District Prison, for theft and destruction. The case was heard by Judge Li Xuedeng yesterday. Zhou Chengxiang testified that he was 55 years old, because the defendant rented a bungalow with a mezzanine in the fourth house of Lane 66, Hu Jia House, owned by the plaintiff in March 1933, for a monthly rent of $4.50. Unexpectedly, on August 29, he removed the iron lock on the adjacent third house, which had been locked by the plaintiff and could not be entered, and tore down the partition wall in the middle to expand it into a connected residence of two houses. He also demolished all the exquisite mezzanine floors that the plaintiff had made and changed them into floors for his own use. He also tore down the plank walls in the house and took them to his house to make plank walls. He reported it to the Public Security Bureau, which ordered him to restore it, but he said he was a public official and a party member and ignored it. We businessmen are too bitter. He even built a thatched hut as a stove shelter, and I didn't interfere with him. Now it's like the saying "sleeping on the plank and climbing onto the bed." He damaged my house and took movable property without permission. Please punish him according to the law and restore it to its original condition, etc. The defendant replied that everything was with the plaintiff's consent. The official then ordered an investigation and further questioning.</p>

<h3>Abbot of Wanfu Nunnery Sues for Defamation: Arising from the Dispute Over the Wan Nian Nunnery Property: Defendant Zhang Jiesheng Claims He Did Not Know About It</h3>
<p>The abbess of Wanfu Nunnery, Nixiu Chan, near the Sun Temple in Zhabei, recently hired lawyer Jiang Chiping to file a lawsuit in the criminal court of the local court against Zhang Jiesheng for disseminating leaflets and defaming her reputation. The case was heard by Judge Xie in the eleventh court yesterday morning at 10:00 am. First, the plaintiff, Xiu Chan, testified that she was 38 years old, from Zhenjiang, and was the disciple of the former abbess of Wanfu Nunnery, Zi Jian. The temple property of Wan Nian Nunnery in Tanziwan, Zhabei, belonged to the venerable Master Tai Zi Jian. The nunnery was managed by Zi Jian. Later, in 1928, Zi Jian was old and sick, so she entrusted her disciple Xiu Jing to manage it on her behalf, and Wanfu Nunnery entrusted the plaintiff as abbess. Unexpectedly, in 1933, Xiu Jing transferred Wan Nian Nunnery to Zhong Lin for management, and Xiu Jing herself completely ignored the nunnery. Now that Zhong Lin has died of illness on June 20 of this year, leaving Wan Nian Nunnery without a manager, the plaintiff has assisted venerable Master Tai Zi Jian in supervising everything in the nunnery. Unexpectedly, the defendant colluded with the nun Long Zhi of the nunnery to prevent venerable Master Tai from managing and the plaintiff from exercising their rights, fabricating facts and disseminating leaflets, falsely claiming that the nuns of Yufu Nunnery had illegally occupied the nunnery and engaged in private extortion, etc. The plaintiff and her master went to supervise Wan Nian Nunnery, which was entirely a legal act. How could it be called illegal occupation? As for private extortion, it was entirely false. It is clear that they fabricated facts with the intention of slander. The defendant has no relationship with Wan Nian Nunnery. Now, with regard to temple affairs, he dares to fabricate facts and damage the plaintiff's reputation, and Wan Nian Nunnery has suffered damage for no reason. The plaintiff requests the presiding judge to punish him according to the law, etc. She also presented a leaflet, which read: "Notice: Wan Nian Nunnery was illegally occupied by the nuns of Wanfu Nunnery last night and engaged in private extortion, which is extremely abhorrent. Jiesheng and others witnessed this situation and are extremely indignant. They plan to convene people from the villages and houses in Tan Town and Gongjiazhai to discuss expelling the nuns of Wanfu Nunnery in order to maintain morality. (Meeting time starts at 3:00 pm today, July 20, which is June 3 of the lunar calendar.) We hope that you will come and not refuse. We hope that you will be aware of it. Zhang Jiesheng and Zhou Rong, jointly announced, July 20, that is, June 3 of the lunar calendar." At this point, the defendant, Zhang Jiesheng, testified that he was 57 years old, a local, and runs the Xie Shen South Goods Store at No. 159 Tanziwan. I have been running a store in this town for five generations, have nine children, five daughters-in-law, and eight grandchildren. I am a proper merchant, who is law-abiding and does not interfere in outside affairs. I do not know about the leaflet and have not intervened in this matter. I do not know who fabricated the name and framed me, etc. At this point, because the defendant completely denied it, the official ordered the witnesses to be summoned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Biscuit and Candy Association Submits Document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Requesting the Cessation of Increased Taxes in Vietnam</h3>
<p>The Biscuit and Candy Industry Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating (previous content omitted): “Since recent years, domestic goods manufacturers in our country have suffered from the global economic downturn externally, and have been affected by rural bankruptcy internally. They struggle arduously and try to survive with difficulty, and are already in a precarious situation. Since the September 18th Incident, the sales routes in North China for our biscuit, candy, and canned goods industries have been completely cut off. The situations in Central and South China are also far from what they used to be. The vitality of various factories is hanging by a thread. Fortunately, in the Nanyang region, due to overseas Chinese not forgetting their homeland and loving domestic goods, and particularly because the overseas Chinese in Vietnam have a deep understanding of domestic goods, exports to Vietnam are still substantial and the future prospects are limitless. However, recently, the Vietnamese government suddenly became envious and implemented a scorched-earth policy, excessively increasing import taxes on goods imported from our country. Such measures are clearly erecting high tariff barriers to block the sales routes of our country's goods and cut off our trade with Vietnam. Upon investigation, the ink is barely dry on the Sino-French Vietnamese commercial agreement, but the authorities are suddenly going against it, disregarding the agreement and arbitrarily increasing taxes, which is truly infuriating. We earnestly request that your ministry promptly raise a serious protest, ensuring that diplomatic relations are considered and the tax increase is urgently cancelled, in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit and equality. The diplomatic front, the national economy, and the people's livelihood will all deeply benefit from this, not only will the future of domestic goods be bright." (remainder omitted)</p>

<h3>Forging Land Deed Mortgage Guarantor Sues for Fraud</h3>
<p>Deng Jieqing, a Cantonese native and the owner of Ruichang Hardware Store at No. 667 Jing'an Temple Road, aged 64, retained lawyer Jiang Hechun to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Chen Huibin, a local resident living upstairs at the Yalu Bookstore at No. 48 Glock Road, of colluding with Ding Huiting, a land guarantor from Map 1, District 1 of the 29th Bao, to forge documents in a fraud case, and filed a civil suit requesting the recovery of the $2,250 compensation paid on his behalf. According to the complaint, in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), Chen Huibin mortgaged a land deed for farmland to the Tongyuan Bank for $4,000, with the plaintiff acting as guarantor and Ding Huiting providing land guarantee certification. At the deadline, Chen first repaid half of the amount, leaving $2,000 outstanding, and replaced the original mortgaged land deed with another land deed (measuring 5 mu, 4 fen, 7 li, 9 hao) from the Jiang character No. 1454 in Map 3, District 1 of the 29th Bao, still with the plaintiff as guarantor. When the deadline arrived, Chen Huibin did not redeem the deed. The creditor, Tongyuan Bank, filed a lawsuit in the Special No. 1 Court to enforce the mortgage. Because the land was located in the Chinese area, the case was entrusted to the Shanghai Local Court for assistance in enforcement. Unexpectedly, when the land deed was checked with the Land Bureau, it was found to be owned by Chen Hanzhou and had another land ownership certificate, rendering the enforcement impossible. The plaintiff had no choice but to pay $2,250 to compensate the debt. However, Chen Huibin and Ding Huiting completely ignored the matter. It is clear that the later land deed was forged by the defendants for fraud. He requests that they be punished according to Articles 211 and 339 of the Criminal Law. Upon receiving the complaint, Judge Chen Shuoying from the Criminal Division No. 2 summoned the defendants yesterday. The defendants did not appear. Because the plaintiff had language difficulties, his lawyer explained the main points of the prosecution on his behalf. Witness Chen Songtao, the head of the business department of Tongyuan Bank, testified that the defendant mortgaged the land deed until the deadline, repaid half of the amount, and still owed half. He also described the circumstances of the replacement of the mortgaged land deed. After reviewing the evidence, the court instructed that the hearing be adjourned to the 15th to summon the defendants for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Loses Over 700 Gold Coins Gambling Check Bounces Holder Hu Tiegen Files Suit Yesterday's Trial Concluded, Judgment Scheduled</h3>
<p>Wang Zongpu, courtesy name Yangsu, from Hangxian, Zhejiang, 26 years old, joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member in July of the 24th year of the Republic (1935) and practiced law in Shanghai, with an office at No. 423 Continental Market and residing at No. 15 Jingu Village, Father Jin Road, French Concession. At 10:00 PM on March 8th of this year, Wang received a phone call at his residence from his friend Hu Jinchang from room 215 of the Datong Hotel, stating that there were business matters to discuss and urging him to go there immediately. Wang complied and went to room 215 of the Datong Hotel, where he chatted with Hu Jinchang and several others. On a whim, they played mahjong with a base of one thousand yuan. After entering the game and playing two rounds, Wang lost over 700 yuan. Wang immediately stopped the game and settled the debt of 749 yuan, issuing a check on the Shanghai Bank branch on Jing'an Temple Road, dated March 9th, with the number C390786 for 749 yuan, to the winner, and they all dispersed. The next day, the check holder and winner, Hu Tiegen (age 36), a native of the right place, went to the Shanghai Bank branch on Jing'an Temple Road to cash the check, but it was returned due to insufficient funds. Hu also sent a letter to Wang, asking for a delay in repayment, but Wang has not paid a penny to this day. The check holder, Hu Tiegen, retained lawyer Ye Changyi to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Wang Zongpu of fraud, and filed a civil suit requesting the recovery of the check amount. Upon receiving the complaint, Judge Qiu Xiying presided over a hearing in the Criminal Division No. 2 yesterday morning. The plaintiff, Hu Tiegen, arrived with his lawyer to explain the situation and present the check as evidence. The defendant, Wang Zongpu, stated that Hu Jinchang, a former classmate from Minli Middle School, called him and invited him to room 215 of the Datong Hotel to discuss business matters. Unexpectedly, there was no business to discuss, and he was urged to play two rounds of mahjong, resulting in him losing over 700 yuan. Fearing that they were setting him up, he immediately stopped. They demanded cash on the spot, otherwise they would not let him leave. Being forced and helpless, he issued the check, deliberately writing the date as August 9th of the 24th year of the Republic, to indicate that he would not honor this gambling debt. The judge reprimanded the defendant, saying, "As a lawyer, you went to play mahjong with a base of one thousand yuan. If you were cheated and lost money, you could have filed a lawsuit and reported it at the time. Why did you only claim it was a gambling game after the plaintiff sued you? You are too absurd." He then ordered the debate to begin, declared it concluded, and scheduled the judgment for the morning of the 11th.</p>
<h3>Cai Wucai and Others Organize Kunshan Fellow Countrymen Association</h3>
<p>Cai Wucai, Tang Wenli, Zhu Yong, and over ten other fellow countrymen from Kunshan in Shanghai believe that the number of Kunshan people in Shanghai is increasing daily. Although some people initiated the organization of a fellow countrymen association last year, it has not yet been formally established. Considering this, Mr. Cai and others continue to initiate the effort and are actively preparing. On the 6th of this month, they held a founders' meeting at the Dongya Restaurant, decided on the preparatory plan, and are separately seeking fellow countrymen to join, hoping to establish the association as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Another Depositor of Meihua Bank Accuses Gu Yubo and Others Of the Eight Defendants, Only Sun Wenkui Appeared Attorney Wu Peng Presents Important Evidence to the Court</h3>
<p>The Meihua Bank, founded by Gu Yubo and others, closed down after only two weeks of operation, making it arguably the shortest-lived bank. However, Gu and others disappeared after the bank failed, ignoring repeated accusations from creditors. Now, Wang Tingfang, Chen Peidong, Wu Youji, Lin Boyuan, Li Qiuyang, Zhu Meifang, Zhou Guanqun, Zhang Yushu, Chuan Fengguo, Li Songsheng, He Hongfang, Ma Buqing, Qian Zhixiang, and fourteen other depositors of the bank, retained attorney Wu Peng to file</p>
<p>criminal self-accusation of fraud and embezzlement</p>
<p>against Gu Yubo and others in the First Special District Local Court, stating that Gu Yubo, Zhang Xusheng, Li Yichou, Bao Ziwu, and Chen Xuanzai were initially co-founders of the former Daxin Bank with Lin Kanghou, Jiang Baili, Shen Jingzhong, Chen Jinnan, and others. However, because the shares could not be concentrated and no record was filed, Li Yichou introduced a merger with the Meihua Bank on January 16th of this year and signed a merger agreement. Gu Yubo subscribed to 150,000 yuan of shares, serving as a director and manager of Meihua Bank. Zhang Xusheng, Li Yichou, Bao Ziwu, Chen Yizhai, etc. each</p>
<p>subscribed to 50,000 shares</p>
<p>Zhang served as deputy manager, Li and Bao as executive directors, and Chen also served as deputy manager. Liu Tongfu, Sun Wenkui, and Wang Zhonglin each served as assistant managers. Whether the subscribed shares were fully paid is unknown. However, without legally registering, the bank opened on April 8th of this year at No. 230 Jiujiang Road. Unexpectedly, it closed down on the 30th of the same month. The plaintiffs were collectively owed 9,945.89 yuan, which is obviously a case of setting up a bank to</p>
<p>fraudulently obtain deposits</p>
<p>and should be punished under Article 339 of the Criminal Law. In addition, the private prosecution requested that, since the bank was not registered, all defendants be held jointly liable for repayment and legal interest. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened a court hearing to summon the defendants. Only Sun Wenkui appeared with his defense attorney, Lin Hanqing. The other seven defendants, Gu Yubo, Zhang Xusheng, Li Yichou, Bao Ziwu, Chen Yizhai, Liu Tongfu, and Wang Zhonglin, were all in hiding. Judge Huang decided to combine the case with</p>
<p>the self-accusation of breach of trust</p>
<p>filed by the Westerners Yale, Menglei, Malaysia, and others against Gu and others, as the circumstances were similar. The Westerners' attorney briefly stated the case, saying that Meihua's closure was due to Gu Yubo, Bao Ziwu, and Chen Yaozai embezzling the collected shares, making it impossible to maintain the bank. He requested that Gu be wanted and that Bao and Chen be arrested and investigated. Then, attorney Wu Peng, representing the other plaintiffs, presented ten photographs, all taken at the bank's opening, and photographs of</p>
<p>various congratulatory telegrams</p>
<p>and the agreement signed with Dajia, stating that this evidence was sufficient to prove that Gu and the other eight defendants were all important figures in the bank and could not deny it. Attorney Lin Hanqing defended Sun Wenkui, saying that Sun was only an employee of the bank. The court then ordered the plaintiffs to present deposit slips to prove the amount of the deposits and adjourned the hearing for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Inmates' Lawsuit Concluded Zhao and Fang Were Not Injured All Five Defendants Found Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Zhu Quanmei, Xue Agen, Yang Wenchang, Gui Jinhu, and Hu Senlong (currently appealing in the second and third trials), five defendants awaiting trial in the detention center of the Special No. 2 Court of the French Concession on Masnan Road (i.e., the prison in the First Special District), recently jointly submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, alleging poor treatment in the detention center. They accused Zhao Taotao and Fang Dalang, two fellow inmates, of flattering the officers and guards and helping them oppress other inmates. Zhu and others were dissatisfied and, on the 13th of last month, they went to Zhao and Fang and claimed that the lawsuit against the warden to improve treatment had cost them 50 or 60 yuan, and demanded that Zhao and Fang each compensate them 30 yuan. Zhao and others refused. On the afternoon of the 14th, before the lockdown, during exercise in the courtyard, the five individuals argued and quarreled with Zhao and Fang, followed by physical assault. The guards intervened and stopped the fight. Zhao and Fang reported to the section chief that they had been injured in the assault, and Zhu and others were transferred to the Special No. 2 Court Procuratorate for investigation. After investigation, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution with the Criminal Division of the same court, accusing the five inmates of obstructing official duties. Judge Chen Shuoying presided over the trial and decided to investigate further before making a decision. The details were briefly recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Chen opened a continued hearing. The plaintiffs, Zhao and Fang, insisted that they had been beaten by Yang Wenchang and Xue Agen and that they still had back pain. The five defendants, Zhu, Xue, Yang, Gui, and Hu, all denied extorting money and assaulting Zhao and Fang. The judge told Zhao and Fang that the procurator from the court had initially gone to the prison to investigate and did not see any injuries on them, nor did they request an examination of their injuries, which indicates that there was no assault. He then announced the verdict in court, finding the five defendants not guilty, and the plaintiffs were sent back to prison to serve their sentences. After years of research and crossing several oceans, has invented lightweight steel typecasting. In previous years, due to equipment constraints, his long-cherished wish was not fulfilled, and he only contributed this plan to foreign countries. The cast steel type, when installed in the Yu-style Chinese typewriter, has been used by 719 places, including the Bank of China, the Zhonghua Book Company, and factories at all levels of the National Government, all of which have given it high praise. Now, to recover profits and develop the cultural industry, he has obtained the necessary equipment and opened the Shanghai Lightweight Steel Typecasting Factory at No. 287 Beijing Road. Lightweight steel typecasting produces type that is white, lustrous, elegantly shaped, hard, and capable of resembling copper. In recent days, the printing industry, including Jiabie, Shangwen, Zhonghua, Shanghai, and Longjiang, has been continuously visiting and purchasing, which is very enthusiastic. It is reported that the inventor, for the sake of further studies, welcomes guidance from all sectors.</p>

<h3>Privately Pledging Deposited Silk Accusations of Business Embezzlement Fuxingheng Suffers Losses of 140,000 to 150,000 Yuan Xu Ziming and Zhu Xingzhai Ordered to Appear, but Cannot Be Found</h3>
<p>Tongfeng Silk Shop, located at No. 20 Jingxing Lane, Tianjin Road, is an extremely large organization managed by Xu Ziming (also known as Minggao) and Zhu Xingzhai (also known as Shikui). Fuxingheng Money Shop, originally located in Chongqing, engages not only in the money industry but also in the silk and cotton business. It appointed deputy manager Li Xiangchi to handle the buying and selling of silk and cotton in Shanghai. Because Tongfeng Silk Shop is very familiar with various foreign firms, Fuxingheng stores all the silk shipped from Sichuan to Shanghai in the shop and entrusts it for sale. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), Fuxingheng stored over 400 dan of Sichuan silk in the shop. Tongfeng sold over 100 dan, leaving 292 dan still in storage, which was worth over 200,000 yuan at the time. Li Xiangchi repeatedly urged the shop to sell the silk, but Xu and Zhu made excuses, claiming that the silk was of poor quality and the market price was not suitable. Until last year, there was still no news of the sale. Li then demanded that the goods be returned, but Tongfeng kept delaying. Li then filed a civil lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Xu and others, demanding the return of the stored silk. Xu and others hired a lawyer to appear in court. The plaintiff, Li Xiangchi, requested that the defendant disclose the identities of the shareholders, but they were unable to do so. Only later did it become known that Tongfeng had mortgaged the stored silk to Xinfu Foreign Firm at No. 9 Aiduya Road in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) for a price of 500 to 600 gold coins per bale. The term was six months, and because it was not redeemed, it was auctioned off by the foreign firm. Tongfeng seemed to have ceased operations last year, with only a few junior employees left to handle matters. Li believed that Xu and Zhu should not have privately mortgaged the deposited goods. Based on the current market price, Fuxingheng suffered a loss of 140,000 to 150,000 yuan, which clearly constituted business embezzlement. Therefore, he retained attorney Wen Dairong to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special No. 1 Court against Xu and Zhu. The court ordered them to appear, but they could not be found. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened a hearing in the Criminal Division No. 8. Because the defendants did not appear, the hearing was adjourned for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Squatter Wang Baoliang Died of Illness Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Squatter Association Requests the Municipal Council to Provide Compensation for a Victim of the Chaoyang Road Demolition The New Voice Society reported that two households at No. 448 Chaoyang Road, Shanghai East, were forcibly demolished because the houses were old and dilapidated, and the owner, Wang Baoliang, repaired them. The Municipal Council deemed this an illegal construction and forcibly demolished them, which was the cause of this tragic incident. On September 2nd, a large number of detectives and laborers forcibly carried out the demolition. Wang Baoliang, being old, suffered too much shock from this incident and became ill immediately. He died around 2:00 AM yesterday morning. His wife, Liu, is also seriously ill and unlikely to survive. Wang Baoliang was a native of Funing, Jiangsu, 58 years old. He used to run a small pharmacy on Chaoyang Road, but business was poor and he had to close down. He was then forced into this squatter's life. He had four sons. The eldest son is an adult and works as a laborer, but the other sons are not yet established. The orphans and the old woman are now destitute, which is unbearable to hear. Wang's body cannot be put into a coffin due to lack of funds, and the situation is extremely tragic. The Squatter Association has requested the Municipal Council to provide compensation. Sincerely, Wang Baoliang, a member of our association and a squatter at No. 448 Chaoyang Road, is 58 years old and a native of Funing, Jiangsu. Since his squatter house was forcibly demolished and all his daily necessities were destroyed, he became depressed and ill from the severe shock. He suffered for several days and could not afford to see a doctor or take medicine. Unfortunately, he passed away at 2:00 AM on the 8th. We are ashamed that we cannot console the deceased. However, we believe that Wang Baoliang was an innocent victim of your council's extraordinary measures and should be given generous compensation to comfort his aggrieved soul. We are endlessly pleading.</p>
<h3>Cao Yunfu Accused of Adultery with Maid</h3>
<p>Cao Yunfu, a Ningbo native, 35 years old, lives at No. 195 McKinley Road. He runs a printing shop and also engages in the insurance business. His family is relatively well-off. He is married to Chen, also from Ningbo, and of the same age as Cao. They have six children. In February of this year, Cao hired Cai Shen, a woman from Haidou (23 years old), as a maid. She resigned at the end of May. After resigning, Cai Shen mentioned to her husband, Cai Yichang, that her master, Cao Yunfu, had had relations with her on April 10th and May 23rd, once in a hostel and once in the master's house. Later, the mistress found out, and Cao dismissed Cai for 20 yuan. Cai Yichang then hired a lawyer on May 27th to file a lawsuit against Cao and Cai Shen in the Special No. 1 Court, accusing them of adultery. However, according to Article 313 of the Criminal Procedure Law, spouses cannot file lawsuits against each other, so the court rejected the case. Now, Cai has hired lawyer Wang Jianhang to report to the Huishan Police Station. The police were ordered to investigate Cai Shen's residence at No. 83, Lane 625, Dongyouheng Road. Cai Shen confessed without hesitation. The police then requested the Special No. 1 Court to issue a summons. Judge Chuan Lin presided over a hearing in the Criminal Division No. 5 yesterday morning. Cai Yichang did not appear. Cai Shen had moved and could not be summoned. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, charged Cao Yunfu and Cai Shen with adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law and requested that Cai Yichang be summoned for further questioning at a later date. Cao Yunfu completely denied the charges. Judge Chuan then adjourned the hearing for further questioning in one week.</p>

<h3>Qian Gaoning Missing</h3>
<p>Qian Gaoning, also known as Shigen, a native of Ningbo, who was the chief of accounting materials at the Miller County Transportation Company on Beijing Road, aged 28, left his residence at No. 6, Renren Lane, East Yalu Road, Hongkou, with colleague Liang Rongsen on August 31st at 5 pm.

Unexpectedly, on the 6th, Xinyuan Company falsely published the same second prize number to attract customers. It is said that Huiliyuan has legally negotiated with Xinyuan Company and has also issued a statement in various newspapers. It is confirmed that the ticket was actually sold by Huiliyuan. The popularity of this lottery shop is truly well-deserved.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I have received a statement from the person concerned, Wang Liu Shi, stating that her late husband, Wang Jiasheng, was seriously injured by his colleague, Zhang Pinfu, in the factory's toilet on the 3rd of this month and died on the afternoon of the 4th. The sudden death has caused unbearable pain. Fortunately, the murderer, Zhang Pinfu, has been arrested by the police. The widow will wait quietly for the court to make a judgment according to the law regarding the prosecution. However, the newspaper reports have stated that the deceased, Wang Jiasheng, had an affair with Zhang Pinfu's wife, A Feng, which is untrue. Leaving aside the fact that the deceased and A Feng are more than twenty years apart in age and usually address each other as "Uncle," how could an affair occur? Even when the deceased was alive, he was silent and taciturn. If he were not a good person, he would not have worked in the electric light factory for fourteen years. Colleagues in the factory and neighbors can all testify. Justice is in the hearts of the people and will be clear after investigation. Now, Zhang Pinfu killed the deceased for no reason and is trying to defend himself with fabricated words, which is utterly heartless. The widow believes that her husband's death was sudden and unexpected, a calamity from the sky, and that he is already suffering in the depths of injustice. Yet after his death, he is being tarnished with an impure reputation, adding injustice to injustice. How can she bear it? Therefore, she has entrusted your lawyer to send a letter to various newspapers for correction. Please publish it to correct the record. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Jia Yi, September 8th, to the Shen Bao Newspaper.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 pm yesterday stated: The Shandong area and the Yellow Sea are overcast with showers and whirlwinds due to a small low-pressure system moving northeastward. The Yellow River basin and the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River are clear and sunny with variable winds. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are cloudy with unsettled winds and strong southeasterly to southwesterly winds. The East China Sea has easterly winds. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 pm yesterday, the local temperature was a high of 91.2 and a low of 76.5. On the same day last year, the high was 90.5 and the low was 76.1.</p>
<h3>Zhang Bofang Appeals Against Fraud Conviction; Hearing Concluded Yesterday; Verdict Scheduled for the 15th</h3>
<p>Zheng Chengqing, a former executive committee member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce who has been expelled, alleged that the national flags manufactured by Zhang Rongchu's National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau used inferior materials. He forged an official document from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stating that it had sent personnel to investigate and forged the signature of the former chairman, Yu Zuoting, to instigate his brother-in-law, Zhang Bofang, manager of the Zhonghe Soap Factory, to visit Zhang with the document and attempt to extort 50,000 yuan. Zhang reported this matter, and the Chamber of Commerce resolved to revoke Zheng's executive committee membership and Yu filed a criminal lawsuit against Zheng and Zhang. Zheng fled after the incident, while Zhang was summoned by the First Special District Local Court. After hearing the case, the court sentenced Zhang to two and a half years of imprisonment, a fine of 900 yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for five years. Zhang, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, hired lawyer Fan Gang to file an appeal with the First Branch of the High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu specially convened a collegiate panel for a joint hearing. Zhang admitted that Zheng Chengqing had instructed him to take the official document to Zhang's place, but claimed that he was unaware that the document was forged by Zheng and that what he was seeking from Zhang was the outstanding shares of the Zhonghe Soap Factory, and absolutely not extorting money. Lawyer Fan Gang further argued that Zhang Rongchu acknowledged that the Zhonghe shares were worth 5,000 yuan, but has not yet paid them, so how could Zhang seek 50,000 yuan? As for the letter written by Zhang Zilian during the first trial, proving that Zhang was seeking money from Tong, it should not be adopted. Zhang Zilian has committed many crimes in recent years, and his character is imaginable, so his testimony is difficult to believe. The original judgment should be revoked, and the appellant should be declared innocent. Yuan Hanyun, the lawyer for the appellant Yu Zuoting, argued that Zheng and Zhang were brothers-in-law, and Zhang could not claim ignorance of the fact that the document was forged by Zheng, and asked the court to impose punishment according to the law. Judge Yu then announced that the verdict would be rendered at 15:00 on September 15.</p>
<h3>Car Hits Person and Flees the Scene; Zhu Tang Dies Unjustly</h3>
<p>Zhu Tang, a 61-year-old Shanghai resident, lived at No. 28, Zhujiazhai, north of Hongqiao Road in Western Shanghai. Yesterday morning at around 3:00 am, he was returning home when he was suddenly hit by a black-plated car on Hongqiao Road, suffering severe head injuries. The driver, seeing that there was no one around, sped away and fled the scene. Later, he was found by the Chinese police, who sent him to the Red Cross for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at 8:30 pm that night and was sent to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Taizhou National Products Sales Office</h3>
<p>— Qiao Yunxun</p>
<p>Last summer, I wrote an article based on my limited knowledge, suggesting that national product sales agencies should be established in county towns, creating smaller-scale national product markets so that the general public in the interior could know where to go to promote national products. Mr. Pan Yangyao, the editor of this publication, added a note expressing enthusiastic support. Before a year has passed, a market exclusively selling national products has actually been discovered in a county town. Overjoyed, I made a special visit. Taizhou is the current Taixian, which originally included Taidong County. Dongtai does not have a city wall and once belonged to Taizhou. Now, Taixian and Dongtai are adjacent to each other. It's called "Taizhou National Products Sales Office" rather than "County." It seems that the natives of the Lixiahe region, and even the eight prefectures of Yangzhou, know Taizhou more deeply than they know Taixian. This is similar to Suzhou and Wuxian. It's also a business strategy. The office is located on Pozi Street outside the North Gate. This street is as lively and prosperous as Guanqian Street in Suzhou and Duozi Street in Yangzhou. The manager, Mr. Xue Pingfan, is in his prime and is a talented and promising young man. He is amiable and willing to be a bulwark for the national products industry. During our conversation, he mentioned that his ancestral home is Jingjiang and that the office originated in Liangxi, the industrial area south of the Yangtze River, as a branch of the Wuxi General Management Office. After the "May 30th Massacre," the Chinese and foreign merchants deeply felt the loss of profits and worried about it. They organized the Datong National Products Management Office, a united front of Chinese and foreign grocery businesses. Now the banner is even clearer, renamed the National Products Market, consigning purely domestic products from major Shanghai factories, such as cotton weaving and printing, steelware, cosmetics, rubber, enamelware, and batteries, as well as household daily necessities. Qiming Cotton Weaving Factory, Family Industrial Cooperative, China Chemical Industrial Cooperative, Liangxinji Toothbrush Factory, Da Dong Rubber Factory, Central Battery Factory, Lixing Thermos Factory, and Wuhe Weaving Factory are all the targets of his promotion. The Taizhou National Products Sales Office follows the business policy of the head office, with minor differences in details. Taixian's retail market is not broad, so it focuses on wholesale. There are full-time representatives who promote to department stores. Mr. Xue believes that by doing so, imported goods will have no place to stand! Although the office does not occupy a large area, the furnishings are in line with modern business rules, and there are printed materials for promotion. The price list has these introductory words: "Entrusted by major national product factories in Shanghai, this office has been specially established in Taizhou to facilitate the procurement of department stores in Taixian, Dongtai, Xinghua, Yancheng, Funing, and other counties. Since its opening, it has been pursuing the aim of faithful service and vigorous promotion of national products!..." After reading these words, one knows its ambition. Finally, I believe that while attention should be paid to wholesale, retail should also be promoted. Mr. Xue nodded in agreement, and we said goodbye with mutual respect.</p>
<p>Announcement: To Mr. Yiyiguanzhu, Ying, Meng Zhao, Xuan Wan, Ying Dai, Jin Rentong, Qiulang, We are grateful for your contributions to the magazine in August. The payment for the contributions has been settled. Please provide a receipt with a stamp from now until the 10th, and from the 16th to the 20th, from 2 pm to 4 pm (excluding Sundays) to the accounting department of this magazine to collect the payment.</p>

<h3>The Fruits of Promoting National Products in Recent Years</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>People love to eat fruit, and they say it is sweet and delicious. But little do they know that at the time of planting the seeds, cultivating the soil, applying fertilizer, and removing weeds, how many years, how much spirit, how much strength, and how much cost have been spent before they can taste the sweetness and sigh in admiration. Perhaps at the time when the fruit ripens, the one who planted the seeds is no longer in this world. "The predecessors plant trees for the descendants to enjoy the shade," "Success does not have to be my own." The mentality of the tree planter is like this, but those who eat its benefits should not forget its favor.</p>
<p>Yesterday at the meeting of the Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, the attendees praised the promotion of national products in recent years, saying that it can be described as vigorous and unstoppable. From government offices to families, wherever there is talk, it is about national products; wherever there is a question, it is about national products; what children sing is about national products; what literati write is about national products; what radio stations broadcast is about national products. Recently, the key point of the New Life Movement is to use national products, and the outline of the National Economic Construction Movement is to promote national products. All government circulars and newspaper and magazine articles are full of national products. How magnificent! The splendor of national products has reached its peak today. If Chinese people living today do not use national products, they are truly deranged and not of the Chinese nation. What is gratifying is that waiters in bars and restaurants mostly use domestic products to serve guests, and children do not want to wear clothes that are not made of domestic fabrics. China's opportunity for revival is within sight. At the same time, Mr. Gan Jie'an, who has been promoting national products for decades, sighed: "Twenty years ago, when we promoted national products, people laughed secretly, either considering it impractical or criticizing it as meddling. Some even regarded it as foolish. At that time, Chinese people lacked patriotic ideas, and national products were also crude and inferior. Modern people regarded imported goods as fashionable and imported goods as glorious. When you talk about national products, they cover their ears and run away. How much effect could it have? And the song was too high for the few to sing along. Who would agree? Who would echo? Who would obey? I never thought that twenty years later, there would be such a glorious and sensational day at home and abroad." As he spoke, tears welled up in his eyes, and everyone present was moved. We dare to comfort you by saying: Without the past, there would be no present. Only by planting seeds in the past can we have the fruits of today. Nothing in the world can be accomplished without hardship. Moreover, the situation of national products today is not optimistic, and it cannot be said that the time has come to eat the fruit. Pests are everywhere, and weeds are everywhere. We still need our association to struggle, cultivate, work hard, and continue the movement to promote national products. Then the sweet fruit can always be delicious. What do the patriotic people of our country think?</p>
<h3>New Developments in National Product Medicine Water, Electric Essence, and Lamps</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>The latest invention among national products, the "Medicine Water Electric Essence Lamp," although previously briefly reported, has not had any follow-up news for a long time. It turns out that the original inventor of this lamp was the Hua Yi Industrial Cooperative, but it only produced samples. In June of this year, it submitted it to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for patent application. Due to a shortage of capital and waiting for the ministry's approval, it temporarily stopped. Recently, however, Mr. Wang and Mr. Wu have also researched and manufactured this lamp, and have succeeded. They are now actively rushing to produce a large number of products. It seems to be a case of "the latecomer surpasses the former." It is heard that they have set a date in mid-September to begin connecting lines for installation. According to reports, the most difficult point of this lamp is the coordination of the medicine water procedure (the medicine water is also a national product). It will use medicine water to conduct electricity. Its wiring situation is similar to ordinary electric lamps, but the bulbs are specially made, and each lamp must have a medicine water bottle box. More lamps will require more boxes. The medicine water can be used for 150 hours, and the electricity cost is two-thirds less than ordinary electric lamps. Therefore, many households have already ordered installations. This is truly a new contribution to the national product industry!</p>

<h3>Recent Four Years of National Central University (3)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jialun</p>
<p>(10) New Xueshi School Xuechi Building, 23,100 yuan. (11) Two new student dormitories, 103,289 yuan. In order to concentrate management, the school returned the rented dormitories and built two new student dormitories on the original site of the old fifth dormitory, which can accommodate hundreds of people. They were designed and supervised by professors from the school's architecture department. Currently, most of the school's students live here. (12) New special mechanical research class factory and wind tunnel room, 11,810 yuan. (13) New telecommunications experimental room, 4,800 yuan. (14) New plant research room and heating system for the Department of Biology, 1,895 yuan. (15) New hydraulic laboratory, 6,200 yuan. (16) New chemical laboratory for the Department of Forestry, 1,100 yuan. (17) New medical school, 42,000 yuan. (18) New refrigerated room for the Department of Animal Husbandry, 5,000 yuan. (19) New National Building of the Experimental School, 12,000 yuan, of which 4,500 yuan was saved from the school's regular expenses. (20) New piano practice room, 1,000 yuan. (21) New dormitory storage room, 3,000 yuan. (22) Additional ball field, 1,200 yuan. (23) Renovation of the Biology Museum, 13,700 yuan. The original Biology Museum was in very poor condition and severely damaged. The groundwater accumulated two or three feet underground, so it had to be completely renovated. (24) Additional new classrooms, factories, and soap factories for the School of Engineering, 6,790 yuan. (25) Renovation and addition of classrooms and laboratories for the School of Education (Nanjing Higher Normal School), 14,530 yuan. This is the oldest building in the school and must be completely renovated. However, the bell tower was not repaired because it might involve other departments. (26) Renovation of the School of Law (Southeast Academy), 7,700 yuan. (27) Renovation of the faculty housing, 5,785 yuan. This is also the earliest building in the school, dilapidated and must be repaired. (28) Renovation of student dormitories, 4,739 yuan. Although this house was built in 1929, the foundation and materials are very poor, so it had to be repaired. (29) Renovation of the South House of the student dormitory, 10,230 yuan. (30) Renovation of the old first dormitory into a female dormitory, 7,000 yuan. The female dormitory was originally rented from private houses. The old first dormitory is now renovated into a female dormitory, so that all female students can live on campus for easy management. The above are only the larger and more expensive ones. In total, from September 1932 to June 1934, the amount has reached 368,160 yuan. There are also smaller buildings and construction projects that cannot be listed one by one, totaling more than 66,849 yuan. From July 1934 to the present, the total construction cost has reached 211,624 yuan. There are also smaller buildings and repairs, such as the addition of chemical laboratories, which are not included here, totaling more than 7,900 yuan. As for the amount not yet paid after the completion of the auditorium and the amount for the installation of seats, 14,455 yuan has also been paid. Therefore, within these four years, the total amount actually paid for construction is 668,988 yuan. For all major constructions, professors are hired to form a construction committee to preside over it, so as to make a joint decision and achieve perfection.</p>
<h3>4. Extensive Expansion of Library and Scientific Instruments</h3>
<p>Besides academic buildings, school facilities primarily consist of libraries and scientific instruments. The current policy focuses on minimizing administrative expenses to expand the aforementioned facilities. This is the wellspring of academic subjects, textbooks, and research, and should not be neglected for even a moment. Examination of the past reveals that while the budget for these facilities was considerable, the actual expenditure on libraries and scientific instruments in a single year amounted to only 36,582 yuan. Since Chancellor Zhu Jiahua's arrival, great efforts have been made to enrich these facilities. From September of the 21st year to June of the 23rd year of the Republic (a period of 22 months), the total expenditure on library resources was 165,342 yuan. Furthermore, from July of the 23rd year to the end of June of the 25th year, the actual expenditure on library resources was 205,303 yuan. Thus, within four years, the total actual expenditure was 370,645 yuan, with the addition of 48,265 volumes of Chinese and Japanese books, 19,570 volumes of Western books, 266 types of Chinese magazines, and 186 types of Western magazines. The number of individual issues is countless. Among the Chinese books, there are many rare and fine editions, and among the Western books, many are considered quite valuable. Examples include P. Gelisdidot's La Peinture decorative en france du 16th au 18th Siecle (French painting from the 16th to 18th centuries, bound from individual pages), Paul Pelliot's Les grottes de toue Houang Peintures et Sculpturesbou dhigues epoques des Wei des Tang et des Long (Buddhist statues and sutras from the Wei, Tang, and Song dynasties in the Dunhuang grottoes, published between 1914 and 1924, in six massive volumes, bound from individual pages), and Arthuur Pugin's Gothic architecture (over a hundred drawings illustrating ancient British architecture, reproduced from originals dating from 1821 to 1838). The number of Western magazine titles is significant. The most gratifying aspect is that a large portion of the Western magazines that were missing from the 20th year of the Republic have been acquired, alleviating the perceived financial burden. It is also noteworthy that a complete collection of over thirty Western magazines has been acquired within a short period. These include Journal fur die reine unp angenandte Mathematik, dating from 1826 to the present (111 years), Justus liebig'S Annaleender Chemie, dating from 1832 to the present (105 years), Petermanns Mittilungen, dating from 1855 to the present (82 years), "Mittilungen"Annaien"B-I-II2, dating from 1869 to the present (68 years), Geographisches Tahrbuch, dating from 1866 to 1931 (66 years), "Berichte der DeutschenBotanischen Gesnllscafi," dating from 1883 to the present (54 years), Acta Mathematica Vol I-66, dating from 1882 to the present (55 years), Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft Vol I-69, dating from 1873 to the present (64 years), "American Journal of Mathematics" Vol. I-58, dating from 1878 to the present (59 years), "Transaction of the American Mathematical Society" Vol. I-39, dating from 1900 to the present (37 years), and "Harvard Law Review" Vol. I-49, dating from 1887 to the present (50 years). All of these have been completely purchased. Some of the more expensive sets cost six or seven thousand yuan, but for the sake of research, no expense has been spared to acquire them.

<h3>Mr. Wang Liansong, A Scholar of New Year, What He Studies</h3>
<p>Wang, styled Baiquan, is from Yingcheng, Hubei. He graduated from National Beiping Industrial University in the 15th year of the Republic and subsequently worked for the Jidun Railway Engineering Bureau in Jilin Province. In the 18th year of the Republic, he served as a technician and senior technician in the municipal utility and public works bureaus of Hankou, and as the director of the Wubo Wireless Radio Station in Wuchang. In the 20th year of the Republic, he served as an electrical engineer for the Pinghan Railway Bureau. He is currently employed by this publication. Mr. Wang has been researching the three great problems of geometry for a total of fourteen years, from the 11th year of the Republic to the present. He has finally completely solved these geometrical puzzles, which have eluded the world's mathematicians for over two thousand years. When he began researching these problems, he first used the triple angle function to create a proportional mean formula to graphically solve the trisection of an angle, finding Nicomedes' conchoid method to be simple. At the same time, he also used this new curve to solve the problem of duplicating the cube, finding it more convenient than Diocles' cissoid method. However, since this curve was still a curved solution and could not be constructed with a ruler and compass, he abandoned this method and switched to using the method of bisecting the angle of eccentrically arranged arcs, spending eight years proving that this bisector was a straight line. At the same time, he also sought the limit of this new bisecting line, using it as a boundary for dividing infinitesimal arcs. Due to the convenience of this new straight line, the problem of trisecting an angle was suddenly solved. After another four years, the problem of duplicating the cube was also solved, still using the same consistent principle. He then continued to solve the problem of squaring the circle. Thus, the three great problems of geometry were thoroughly solved. Immediately following this, he generalized and solved the problems of dividing an angle into any number of equal parts, dividing a circle into any number of equal parts, straightening the circumference of a circle, squaring the surface of a sphere, and cubing the volume of a sphere, all based on the above principles. Mr. Wang is currently editing his research findings into a book, which he will submit to the Academia Sinica, the Ministry of Education, and other organizations for review. He is also translating it into English to be sent to the World Educational Association for research. Below is a recent photo of Liansong (taken by International News Service).</p>

<h3>Today's Annual Meeting of the Shanghai Western Football Association Will Discuss Reforming the League Scheme; The Western Association Plans a Scheme to Respond to Attackers; A League Committee of Three Will Be Established to Handle the League; Last Year's Revenue Was Over 17,900 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Football Association is scheduled to hold its annual meeting at 5:15 PM on the 10th of this month (tomorrow) at the Western Children's Public School at 219 Jiujiang Road. The motions to be discussed at the annual meeting have attracted attention from all walks of life. It is generally agreed that the reform of the league organization scheme will become the focus of debate. The reform of the organization scheme has been included as the fourth item on the agenda for this year's annual meeting, but it is noted that this refers to the measures announced by the association on August 17. The sixth item is proposals from various teams, which are still being compiled and have not yet been listed in detail. The association's accounts for the past season will also be reported at the annual meeting. The following is a breakdown:</p>
<p>Annual Meeting Agenda</p>
<p>(1) Report on the past year's progress and overview (i.e., the implementation plan resolved at the annual meeting on September 12, 1935); (2) Report on the results and accounts of the previous competition (up to July 31); (3) Election of this year's officers, including: (A) One president; (B) Four vice presidents; (C) Four team representatives attending the meeting; (D) Other officers; (4) Reform of this year's Western League organization scheme (i.e., the notice to all member teams issued on August 17 of this year); (5) Organization committee responsible for drafting the association's new constitution and new rules; (6) Cases proposed by various teams (cases proposed by each team must be submitted to the registrar's office two days before the annual meeting, but in addition to the proposer's signature, there must be a countersignature from one team). Notice: Those attending the meeting are Western League officers, committee members, representatives from each team (two people), and referees. Seating: Members and those with voting rights are on the right side of the podium, and observers are on the left side. Newspaper reporters are in the front row near the podium.</p>
<p>Restructuring Plan</p>
<p>The Western League Football Association issued a draft reform plan to its member teams on the 17th of last month, which will be submitted at this year's annual meeting. The plan includes a total of nine articles, which are listed below. If the plan is adopted, it will be implemented this season and will be valid until 1937-38.</p>
<p>(1) This year's Shanghai Western Football Association will be divided into three groups (Groups A, B, and C).</p>
<p>(2) There will also be a reserve group, specifically for the inclusion of reserve teams from Group A. Players in the reserve group will not be restricted from competing in Group A.</p>
<p>(3) Member teams joining Group A must join one reserve group team.</p>
<p>(4) The bottom team in Group A will be relegated to Group B, and the champion of Group B can be promoted to Group A (but must join one reserve group team). The bottom team in Group B will be relegated to Group C, and the champion of Group C can be promoted to Group B.</p>
<p>(5) There will be a Sunday morning league to replace the previous Group E, with a limit of twelve teams.</p>
<p>(6) All member teams can join the league or the Sunday morning league.</p>
<p>(7) Each member team can join at most one team in the league or the Sunday morning league.</p>
<p>(8) In each match, the winner will receive two points, the loser will receive zero points, and a draw will result in each team receiving one point. If the scores are the same at the end, the average number of winning goals will be used.</p>
<p>(9) This season's League Committee will consist of five members, three of whom will be selected from the executive committee, and the remaining two will be selected from the member teams. This committee has no administrative power but can report to the executive committee for handling.</p>
<p>(Note) This reform plan is very similar to Davidson's plan, and is a modified version of Davidson's plan. The biggest difference is that the league will still be subordinate to the Western Association and will not be independent. However, a committee of three will be established. This is clearly a response to Davidson's attacks.</p>

In the morning, overseas reports indicated that both near-term and long-term pound rates were flat in London. Traders claimed that after the market closed, there were buyers at the fixing price, and sellers were trading above 0.0625, with not many transactions and the market was quite stable. Silver markets in New York and Montreux forward silver prices were both closed. London spot gold was unchanged.

The HSBC Bank's fixing announcement showed that both the pound and the dollar were flat, and the silver equalization tax was unchanged, so the market was hovering and the potential was slightly loose. After entering the market, Mobil Oil Company took advantage of the cheap price to buy US dollars, and banks were still selling US dollars, but they were blocked and the market remained in a stalemate. In the afternoon market, foreign banks continued to sell, but because there were people maintaining the price, the trend had stabilized. Japanese banks were buying US dollars and selling Japanese currency to arbitrage exchange rates. The Indian silver reported an increase of one anna, and the market was slightly fluctuating.

<h3>Securities - Few New Transactions in Public Bonds - Number of Account Balances Also Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange saw very few new transactions due to the lack of significant changes in the environment. After days of hovering and brewing, the number of account balances has gradually declined. The total number of accounts for September and October is less than 25 million yuan. With a shallow river, there is little water, and there are no waves. It is not easy to have any major changes in the future. Speculators have left to go elsewhere, and the market situation is bleak. In the course of yesterday, there were quite a few sales of No. 10, No. 11, and No. 21 at the opening, but the market only weakened slightly by one or two corners because No. 47 suddenly had demand. In the second round, No. 53 was sold and No. 54 was bought, and the market price wanted to fall but could not, and only continued to drop by about one corner. The market opened flat in the afternoon. However, No. 16, No. 32, and No. 53, etc., all wanted to buy forward bonds of Category E and suddenly raised the price by three or four corners. The following categories were all raised by two or three corners. The transactions were clear at the close, and the market price returned to chaos, still varying between five cents and one corner. In summary, the results of the market prices were mostly slightly better by five cents to one corner. Only Category A was down slightly by five cents because there were more sales of No. 10. The total number of transactions was 3,395,000 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Differing Perspectives of Bulls and Bears - Yarn Market in a Hovering State</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with mixed increases and decreases, and the trend is uneven. This is because the bulls and bears have different opinions, each with their own perspectives. The buyers are aware that the inventory of existing yarn mills is decreasing and that customer sales are smooth. However, the bears are concerned that the weather is favorable and the cotton production is abundant, so they are bearish on the forward yarn price and tend to sell.</p>
<p>Posted Yarn Prices Show Mixed Increases and Decreases</p>
<p>At the opening of the yarn market in the morning, the prices for each month showed an uneven picture, fluctuating up and down by three or four corners. This was because after the large traders had hedged and sold the previous day, the market sentiment was dispersed. After the second round, rumors spread that customers of existing yarn still had high hopes for large-scale development, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. This month suddenly jumped by 1.3 yuan, but the prices for the far-term contract turned loose and fell back by two or three corners. There were very few transactions in the market. Hexing, Guangfeng, Ruida, and Dachangcheng took long positions and slightly settled, and the situation was weak. However, Hengyi, Mingde, Shenji, and Fukang came back to cover their positions. As a result, the prices for each month fell by two, four, and five corners compared with the closing prices of the previous day, but this month was unchanged, and October rose by two corners. The market opened in the afternoon, and it was heard that yarn sales were still good. There were still more than 2,000 bales of transactions. The shorts covered their positions and the price rose by six or seven corners. In the second round, the price of raw cotton was weak and fell again, but the market atmosphere rose and fell unevenly. As a result, the prices for each month fell by 1.4 yuan for the near-term contract and rose by three, five, and six corners for the far-term contract compared with the morning closing prices. It was found that Dafu sold 1,350 bales, Meiji sold 1,050 bales, Hexing sold 2,400 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,150 bales, Ruida sold 1,150 bales, Dachangcheng sold 2,200 bales, and Yuda sold 2,300 bales.

<p>It was found that the total number of bales bought by each gang throughout the day was 2,040 bales, and the selling price was similar to that of the previous day. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below:</p>

<h3>Existing Cotton Mills Need Healthy Cotton - Decline in Cotton Prices Temporarily Ceases - Weather Clear on the Autumn Equinox - Development of Cotton Plants Can Be Guaranteed Without Worry</h3>
<p>The cotton market is increasingly expensive, because the price of cotton in Hanpu is strong, and the existing cotton mills are quite healthy, and the purchases are very enthusiastic, so there are fewer hedgers. However, some cotton merchants are optimistic about the future of cotton due to the good autumn equinox and the clear weather.</p>
<p>Posted Cotton Prices Still Rise by More Than a Dime</p>
<p>The posted cotton market opened in the morning, the US cotton market was closed, and the Indian cotton fell by 1 to 2 rupees. The market sentiment was stronger, because there was a lack of new sellers, the trading floor was dry, and the prices for the far-term contracts turned favorable, rising by 1.5 to 2 dimes. In the second round, the yarn market was weak, and the autumn equinox and clear weather were very beneficial to the cotton plants, so the shorts came to put pressure on the market and the price fell by 2 dimes. However, the Ningbo gang tended to turn from short to long, and Hengyi, Shenji, Fukang, Yuanxingchang, and Changhe covered their short positions and increased their positions. Both sides rose together, but Ruida, Juxing, Changfeng, Yikang, and Xincheng took short positions and increased their positions, and the amount was very small. As a result, the prices for each month rose by 5 to 10 points compared with the closing prices of the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon, and it was rumored that the Fortune Foreign Firm had a private telegram that the estimate for US cotton was reduced by more than 600,000 bales compared with the previous estimate, and it was expected that the US cotton market would be favorable to the buyers tomorrow, and the buying interest was revived, rising by 2 dimes. After the second round, the longs, Runkang and Yuda, came out in large quantities again, and the price suddenly fell. As a result, the prices for each month still rose by 5 to 10 points compared with the morning closing prices. It was found that Yuda sold 9,800 dan, Juxing sold 1,900 dan, Ruida sold 4,400 dan, Changfeng sold 4,800 dan, Runkang sold 13,500 dan, Xincheng sold 3,400 dan, and Yikang sold 4,100 dan.

<p>New Yao Flowers Arrive Uninterrupted</p>
<p>The consumption of existing cotton is still quite high, the factory inventory is very good, and the source arrives at 2,900 bales of Yao flowers, and the asking price is similar to that of the previous day.</p>

<h3>British and Indian Cotton Prices Slightly Rebound - Prices of Three Grades of Yarn and Cotton Show Mixed Increases and Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed. The spot price of British cotton fell by 9 points, and the futures price fell by 4 to 6 points. The price of Indian cotton initially rose due to short covering and limited transactions. Dealers were generally taking a wait-and-see attitude. Later, the price fell due to reports that Gukila and Kaishawah had received beneficial rain. It is estimated that Pinggul fell by 1.5 rupees, and Omra and Bairoxi fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 7th):</p>
<p>Also, according to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening price forecast for the 8th was: Bairoxi at 214.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; Omra at 192 rupees, up 0.25 rupees; and Pinggul at 156.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees.</p>

<h3>Large Movement of Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth - Tianjin, Guangdong, Shaanxi, and Henan All Adding Purchases - Domestic Allocations Increase Several Times</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the posted cotton and yarn market was flat and weak, while the sales of existing yarn continued to be good, and the market situation was quite good. The Tianjin and Guangdong gangs also made large purchases of cotton cloth. The Tianjin gang purchased more than 400 pieces of 11-pound Three Rabbits coarse cloth, 12-pound Three Rabbits coarse twill, 11-pound Cat Eagle coarse twill, and 16-pound coarse cloth from Shenxin, Xinyu, Qingfeng, and other factories from the British firm Jardine Matheson. They also purchased more than 100 pieces of printed straight tribute, serge, and Meiheng and Dafeng thread, serge, and bleached cloth from Lunchang and Hengfeng factories. The two Guangdong gangs were eager to purchase the current-month and next-month futures of fine twill from local factories, and the transactions reached more than 1,000 pieces. The amount of fine twill was consistently lacking, and the market price also rose slightly by 5 points. White coarse cloth, fine cloth, serge, thread, printed goods were also purchased enthusiastically in serge. The demand for printed and dyed cloth from the Shaanxi and Henan gangs was still good. The autumn sales in the nearby areas were booming, and the customers from various inland routes came to Shanghai to allocate goods. The items were numerous, increasing several times compared to normal times, resulting in the wholesale shops for various grades of silk, straight tribute, serge, printed goods, velvet goods, and colored cloth selling very well in recent days. The patterns and colors of each factory were indeed strong and in short supply. The sales of white fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse cloth to local and inland gangs continued to be strong, and the market was very stable.</p>
<h3>This Street's Woolen Fabrics Were Once Extremely Prosperous</h3>
<p>The sales of woolen fabrics have recently been brisk from all directions. Imported goods from the West and domestically produced wool products have seen substantial transactions. Feathered wool, "Yuan Chang" serge, "Huate" wool, and "Sanyuan" light floral wool are selling well. Sleeve linings of Western cloth, French "Xi Cun," charcoal linings, and both wide and narrow plain camel wool are also enjoying strong market sales. Hat workshops, overcoat workshops, and tailor shops are all showing interest in purchasing. Financially sound firms are still actively seeking out available goods from foreign firms. The foreign firms are also aware of the progress in the woolen fabric market, with prices increasing, leading most of them to be unwilling to sell easily.</p>
<h3>Grains: Tianjin Shipped 40,000 to 50,000 Bags of Flour Yesterday; Prices Rose but Remained Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an initial stability followed by weakness after the opening bell. With no quotations for imported wheat, market sentiment lacked support. However, during the opening, Tianjin shipped 40,000 to 50,000 bags of available flour, which were purchased for 1.60 yuan per bag. This transaction was directly between the factory and the buyer, not a market purchase. Nevertheless, this caused a brief surge in the opening price for the current month, rising by 8.5 fen. October and November also saw gains of 1 fen, while subsequent months showed no improvement. As the afternoon session began, the trend weakened again, as the accumulation of available goods outstripped sales. Some factories began selling off their holdings, leading to renewed market weakness. Prices fell by 1 to 2 fen from the morning's high. According to industry insiders, without a large-scale outlet in the future, flour prices are likely to face downward pressure.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Trading Was Quiet—Following the Flour Market Downward in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market opened with relatively stable prices across all months. With no market for imported wheat and mainland clients mostly adopting a wait-and-see approach, it was difficult for the wheat market to rally compared to rice prices. However, the period for new harvests had passed, and most goods were held by grain merchants and hoarders who were unwilling to sell unless absolutely necessary. As a result, trading slowed, with minimal fluctuations. When the afternoon session began, the flour market weakened again, and with few buyers, prices across all months fell by about 2 to 3 fen. Future trends will likely depend on flour sales. The current wheat market sees stable prices for high-quality goods, while mid-range and lower-quality goods are average. "Kaiyang He Yao Wan" wheat is priced at 4.88 yuan, "Bengbu" wheat at 4.82 yuan (second grade at 4.76 yuan), "Gaoyou" wheat at 4.75 yuan (second grade at 4.70 yuan), "Jiangjiaba" wheat at 4.76 yuan, "Shuixikou" wheat at 4.70 yuan, "Suqian" wheat at 4.82 yuan, "Wuhu" wheat at 4.57 yuan (second grade at 4.52 yuan), "Dongge" wheat at 4.67 yuan, "Sizhou" wheat at 4.85 yuan, and "Dongtai" wheat at 4.85 yuan. Fuxin purchased 7,000 bags, and Shenda purchased 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3>New Rice Shipments Arrive Daily—Prices Declined Steadily from Yesterday's Opening</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, shipments from various regions totaled seventeen or eighteen, amounting to 3,600 to 3,700 shi. Retail sales remained sluggish, and bulk buyers from Dalian and Qingdao only purchased over 900 bags, making it difficult for the market to rally. Thick early japonica rice prices continued to fall by several fen to 1 jiao, while thin indica rice was stable in bulk purchases and continued to see slight reductions in retail sales. Although Dongxin japonica rice prices stabilized, lower-quality rice from Hebei depreciated by several fen. New "Du Yang Jian" and similar varieties experienced similar price movements. Overall, with new goods arriving daily, prospects are not promising.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, shipments from various regions of Hebei arrived at more than twenty locations. Sales of white japonica and thin indica rice were normal, while aged "Yangfu Jian" rice was average. New "Yang Tuan Jian" rice saw slight price adjustments, while "Bian Yuan Xin Ke Jian" rice was flat. Market prices showed stable prices for white japonica new "Bu Jian" and "Dongxin" japonica rice. Aged "Yang Jian," "Bian Yuan," thin indica, and new "Tuan Jian" rice were weak by several fen. New "Yang Jian" rice prices fell by 1 to 2 jiao, and new "Ke Jian" rice prices fell by nearly 1 jiao. Yesterday, over 10 shi of new Kunshan japonica rice arrived, with excellent quality, and an opening price of 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Early Indica Rice Abundant, Prices Weak—Shanghai Market Down Over 0.2 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, shipments of early indica rice continued to flood in from various regions along the Yangtze River. Polished rice arrivals were even more abundant due to active sales to Guangdong in the previous month. Market inventories are gradually filling up, and with recent sales to Guangdong slowing down, purchasing prices are particularly tight. Merchants and owners, noting the abundance of goods and falling prices in producing areas, were keen to reduce prices and sell quickly. As a result, polished rice prices suddenly fell by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan. Mechanically milled rice also fell by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Despite the price drop, digestion of stock was still happening. Guangdong buyers made some small purchases of polished rice. Daily transactions included 3,025 bags of Jiangxi rice, 6,300 bags of Hunan rice, 158 bags of Beijing polished rice, and 108 bags of Hanzuo rice. Purchases were mainly from this street, with some participation from Ningbo, Shantou, and northern regions.</p>
<h3>New Sesame Seeds Gradually Enter the Market—Hoping Producing Areas Will Not Adulterate with Mud and Ash</h3>
<p>This year's new sesame seeds from various regions are entering the market earlier than in previous years. The harvest is also expected to be optimistic, with good quality. However, it is hoped that producing areas will not adulterate the seeds with mud and ash, as this year's sales depend entirely on foreign markets. Therefore, in the international arena, it is essential to maintain the reputation of our country's agricultural products and avoid being despised for greed. Yesterday's transactions included 300 bags of new Shashi sesame at 10.09 yuan, 18 bags of new Guide sesame at 10.055 yuan, 35 bags of new Nanjing sesame at 9.06 yuan, 20 bags of new Suzhou sesame at 9.015 yuan, and 53 bags of new Yangzhou sesame at 9.03 yuan and 9.01 yuan. The current upward trend is due to new goods being traded and the weakness of foreign firms, so the future is likely to suffer. Yesterday, foreign firms dumped 450 tons at 11.082 yuan per original package.</p>
<h3>Grain Price Statistics for August (2)</h3>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Market Still Relies on End Users</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York was closed for Labor Day, so there was no market. The Lyon silk market remained stable. In Binjiang, it was learned that this year's autumn cocoons had a poor harvest (a 10% reduction in production compared to last year), so silk prices slightly increased, with spot prices rising by 3 yuan and futures prices by 11 yuan. The Shanghai silk market remained active, driven by end users, but prices showed no improvement. Yesterday, ordinary B-grade silk fell below the 600 yuan mark, but sales remained strong. Yesterday, foreign firms and end users purchased a total of 158 bales.</p>
<h3>Red Tea from Hunan and Hubei Plummeted</h3>
<p>According to news from Hankou, this year's total red tea production in Hunan and Hubei provinces is 230,000 chests. More than 100,000 chests were previously purchased by British firms Jardine Matheson and Concordia, as well as Soviet tea buying organizations, and the market was in good condition. Recently, the market has been severely impacted by the low-priced competition from Indian and Ceylon tea. Sales have been sluggish for the past two weeks, with inventories piling up to 80,000 chests. Red tea prices have plummeted to 21-22 yuan, and floral-scented teas have fallen to around 10 yuan, making the market situation extremely unfavorable.</p>
<p>According to the Tea Industry Association's report, green tea sales were brisk last week but have been quieter this week. In the past two days, only Longjin and Suizhen have sold over 300 chests at 50 yuan and 51 yuan, respectively. Concordia has made small purchases of Tezhen and Xiaozhen eyebrow tea, and Tongfu and Fushi have also made small transactions for Tezhen. It is also heard that Longjin is negotiating for over 200 chests of Tezhen, which may be concluded within days. Ping Shui tea remains quiet, but Jinlong continues to make transactions of disassembled shipments.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: New Red Dates and Longans Have Arrived in Shanghai; One More Longan Company—Bao Da</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Jixin red dates was shipped from Zhenjiang by shipping companies yesterday, totaling over 300 bags. Samples have already been shown, and the goods are of good quality. Prices are currently being negotiated, so they have not been released yet. New longans arrived via the Taiyuan steamer yesterday in a second batch, with over 1,300 pieces from Tong'an, Zhangzhou, and Anhai. Samples of the larger pieces will be available tomorrow or the day after. Prices are not expected to fluctuate significantly. Industry sources also report that people from the financial sector and a certain longan company have formed a new Bao Da Longan Company, managed by Mr. Yuan Chunfa. The company has joined the industry association and will begin operations immediately.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New Dutch Red Sugar Sold Out Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was little movement in the sugar market. The exchange set prices, with No. 24 coarse white sugar and No. 489 East White sugar maintaining their original prices. The price of No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory remained at 20.5 yuan. However, the newly arrived No. 89 New Dutch Red sugar, which arrived the day before yesterday, was sold out yesterday at 6.05 yuan. The exchange prices were stable, and few transactions were made. It is rumored that merchants are considering continuing to purchase Chaoqing sugar from Shantou, so the future market is unlikely to ease.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Chen Yunsu)</p>
<p>Those who become university professors often yearn for the dignity of a university president; once the title of university president is bestowed upon them, they immediately crave to experience being the Minister of Education; and once they seize the seal of the Minister of Education, they never think of their old lives again. What is this called? The former is called 'wanting more after getting Shu', and the latter is called 'being so happy as to forget Shu'. Both are undesirable!</p>
<p>Friends perched atop towers should look down at the lost sheep below and try to point out their path, so they too may have the possibility of climbing up.</p>
<p>Some say that the current cramming education is not for the sake of students' substantial knowledge, nor for their future prospects, but solely to cope with exams, spot checks, and superiors' praises. This is just like those who feed ducks; their aim is not for the ducks themselves to be plump, but for those gluttons who eat duck meat!</p>
<p>Doing things is like eating snacks. Snacks should be chosen to our liking, and work should be chosen to be close to our nature. Only by eating in this way will it suit our appetite, and only by working in this way will it be meaningful. Otherwise, the body will certainly not be comfortable, and there will be no progress in the career.</p>
<h3>Philosophy of Running a School</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>The "school" mentioned here is a private school. Running a private school is different from running a provincial school. Different sources of funding and different enrollment methods are the two most obvious differences; therefore, running a private school has its own secrets.</p>
<p>If we compare schools to shops, then students are the customers. There are certainly private schools that treat everyone equally; however, those that recruit students with "big discounts" are also commonly seen. The so-called "big discounts" do not mean reducing tuition fees; rather, it means accepting everyone who comes, regardless of their qualifications, which is a wonderful method for absorbing currency.</p>
<p>After customers enter the door, they cannot be easily let go, so it is important to know how to retain them. What is the method of retaining them? Management may be lenient, and homework need not be taken seriously. An official of a certain school—no, the owner—once expressed his school management policy, saying: "The more students, the better; the fewer students repeating grades, the better." This is indeed a profound understanding of the essence of the matter. As for the school's reputation, it must naturally be taken care of; therefore, the owner of a certain school also successively invented the method of being lenient first and then strict, that is, allowing students to pass the first few semesters carelessly in order to absorb currency, but then suddenly tightening up on students in the last semester, eliminating the dross and retaining the essence. Naturally, they can cope with the exams and everyone will "pass," and the school's reputation will naturally improve day by day.</p>
<p>Inspections by the superintendent of schools are not something to be trifled with; however, they can be dealt with. Usually, plant more flowers and trees in the school, and temporarily whitewash all the walls. Then, order the students to strictly maintain order. Naturally, the superintendent will have a feeling of relaxation and happiness, or perhaps he can win a commendation, and the whole school will smile with joy.</p>
<p>Private school owners who want to keep their jobs also have a secret: when the board of directors invites them three times, instead of being flattered and surprised, it is better to put on a slight show of pride. By putting on a slight show of pride, you can secure a longer contract. With a longer contract, can't you act arbitrarily and treat the school as your private property!</p>
<h3>Lovers</h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>In ancient times, it was considered a virtue for women to stay at home and avoid social interaction; in modern times, it is considered fashionable for women to be good at socializing with men. Therefore, in the past, even when men and women walked together, they were always one in front and one behind, with a distance of three to five feet between them. Now, when men and women walk together, they are always arm in arm, leaning on each other, with an air of intimacy, not at all avoiding the eyes of strangers. Moralists regard this modern behavior, which goes against the principle of not allowing men and women to touch each other, as a sign of declining morality. However, modern men and women claim to be "lovers."</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, it is the most active period for lovers. If you happen to step into a park, you will find it filled with pairs of men and women in the woods, by the ponds, and everywhere else. These are the lovers. By the poolsides and on the beaches of swimming pools and seaside resorts, under the colorful parasols, you will find pairs of men and women. These are naturally also lovers. In air-conditioned cinemas, in the last few rows of seats, you will find pairs of men and women, whispering and laughing teasingly in the dark space where the movie is playing. These are the lovers. In high-class dance halls that do not provide dance partners, under the dim green lights, you will find pairs of men and women, their faces close together, their chests touching, their toes touching, dancing to the music. Among them, there are certainly many who are lovers. In the evenings after dinner, on the sidewalks under the tall French parasol trees, in the gentle breeze, you will find even more lovers strolling slowly, talking and laughing, arm in arm. "Lovers" have become the most poetic decoration in big cities.</p>
<p>If marriage is the tomb of love, then I think the lover period should be considered the bud of love. On the faces of pairs of lovers, there is a genuine and innocent smile. The passion in their hearts bursts forth and is revealed on the corners of their lips. Everyone forgets everything else besides love, forgets all the sorrows and pains of the world. What every lover feels is, "In my heart, there is only you; in your heart, there is only me."</p>
<p>However, there is no bud that does not bloom, so most lovers in the world end in marriage. There is also a small portion that is hit and destroyed by the external forces of storms. Marriage is the tomb of love, and a bud that is destroyed by storms is even more likely to end in tragedy. Therefore, I wish the pairs of lovers I see would savor the sweetness of your lover period as much as possible. The lover period is truly the golden period of your lifelong love life. Hold on to it tightly, and don't let it escape lightly.</p>
<h3>Monk Beans</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>In our Jiangzhe area, beans seem to be a popular food. Different methods of stir-frying, stewing, and simmering produce various individual names and flavors, such as loose and crispy sand-fried beans, sweet and fragrant spiced beans, and salty and hard fried salt beans. However, the most popular are the soft, tender, and greasy monk beans.</p>
<p>It is said that monk beans were created by Su Dongpo. The green beans are peeled on one end, soaked in water to plump them up, and then stewed with salty ingredients. They are cooked through in just one mealtime. They can be eaten with wine or as a side dish, melting in your mouth. Like watermelon seeds and peanuts, people can't get enough of them and don't want to stop. Spiced beans and sand-fried beans also have their own unique flavors, but they always have some elasticity and resistance. However, although it can be welcomed by eaters, it is only a weak person who sacrifices himself for people to chew!</p>
<p>If we use a monk bean to symbolize our ancient country and nation, then fried salt beans can be compared to Abyssinia, because it, after all, gives the teeth more resistance. If you are not careful, you will have to break your gums and bite your tongue. Although it is finally swallowed, it also leaves some residue, some burnt skin chips, embedded in the teeth to make trouble, giving the eater a great discomfort. When you want to get your hands on it, your hands will also get greasy. Monk beans are not like that. They are just obedient and docile. Under the power of the tip of the tongue, the skin and flesh have melted, and there are no crumbs left. This is also very sad!</p>
<p>But our beans are already destined to be beans. We only hope that those in charge of cooking will cook more fried salt beans, and don't just cater to people's tastes, soaking them fat and soft, so that people can also feel inconvenient and know what to be wary of.</p>
<h3>Phoenixes Replaced in the Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Iron Face Sees Close Hearts, Words Deceive Parrots; Moth Eyebrows Preserve Chivalry, Asks About the Classics of Kunlun</p>
<p>At this time, dinner had already been brought to the table, interrupting the conversation between mother and daughter. Menglan stopped mentioning it, and in order to dispel her mother's suspicion, she cheered up and ate a bowl and a half of rice. After dinner, she sat in her mother's room for half an hour before returning to her room upstairs. It happened to be a Sunday. Although she was very willing to go out for a walk to relieve her boredom, her body was tired and she couldn't muster any energy. Therefore, she just piled a few magazines on the table and casually flipped through them. Just as she was getting interested in reading, suddenly two hands reached out and covered her eyes. Raising her hand to feel those two hands, she only felt that they were soft and there was a ring. So she smiled and said, "I guessed it right away, you are Li Youmei." The person put down her hand and smiled, "How did you know it was me?" Menglan stood up and smiled, "Such a big girl, still so naughty. You look like Xue Baochai, and your personality is like Shi Xiangyun. You are a beauty who combines both perfections." Youmei laughed and said, "You're still talking about people. You don't study the proper books and only secretly read 'Dream of the Red Chamber' at home." Saying that, she took Menglan's hand and sat down on the edge of the bed together. Menglan saw that she was wearing a light red silk jacket, with a long blue lake-colored skirt underneath, and a pair of white cloth shoes were exposed. Her plump skin was exposed in the cuffs, which was really cute. She also had a long, round face, big eyes, and two red blushes on her cheeks, which harmonized beautifully with her black, oily hair. She suddenly laughed and said, "What are you looking at me for?" Menglan said, "Summer is coming soon, you will look even better when you take off your clothes." Youmei smiled and said, "If you like to watch, then watch." I heard Auntie say that you have been very uncomfortable these days, how come you are so happy when you see me?" Menglan couldn't help but sigh when she heard this. Youmei held one of her hands and said, "So, you really have something that is making you unhappy. What is it for?" Menglan said, "There is no way to say." Saying that, she shook her head twice. Youmei said, "We are such good friends, you shouldn't hide anything from me. I am the most nosy person, maybe the thing that you feel is difficult, just happens to be something that I can help with." When Menglan heard this, she couldn't help but suddenly stand up, looked at her face and said, "What, you can help me? How can you help me?" When she said this, her face turned red. The blush rose very fiercely, as if it did not belong to the aspect of shyness. Youmei said, "You haven't said what the difficulty is, how can I say that I can help you." Menglan said, "Because you said that you can just help, I suspect that you know what my difficulty is." Youmei smiled and said, "That's you misunderstanding my meaning. I thought that your matter, maybe you can use me." Menglan stopped mentioning this. She sat down on the chair at the table, supported her head with her hand, and sighed slightly. (72)</p>
<h3>The National Army's Broadsword Brigade and the Old Wang Mazi Store in the Former Capital (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Bingyuan</p>
<p>I once heard a military expert say that among the daredevil teams in the various armies of our country, the one affiliated with the Northwest Army led by General Feng Huanzhang was always the most highly regarded. Its training, skills, and combat strength should all be second to none. The team members were all selected from the strong and robust in the army, receiving individual training, and everyone was proficient in martial arts, with profound fighting skills. Even in unarmed combat, they could withstand the strength of more than a dozen strong men, and it was not easy to get close to them. The knives used by the team members were all made of wrought steel, thick on the back, narrow on the face, and thin on the edge. Although they were not necessarily like the treasured swords of chivalrous warriors in novels, which could cut hair blown against them and chop iron and cut nails, using them to chop off heads and unload arms, coupled with the skills displayed by the team members, was indeed like cutting vegetables and breaking melons.</p>
<p>As for the source of the knives, they did not come from the ordnance factories of national institutions, but were made by the old Wang Mazi ironware shop in the former capital. According to the old Wang family store in the former capital, also known as Wang Mazi Iron Shop, it was opened in Dongsi Pailou and has a history of more than 400 years, famous in the martial arts world for manufacturing the eighteen kinds of old weapons, such as knives, guns, swords, and halberds. It is said that the third-generation owner of the store, that is, Wang Mazi, liked to play with knives, guns, sticks, and clubs in his youth, and later inherited the Shaolin Orthodox knife technique from a famous teacher. Wang was taciturn, did not smile easily, and would stand up for injustice. He especially valued righteousness and trustworthiness. Regardless of whether he was in charge or not, if anyone asked for help in an emergency, he would always respond. His ancestor was a survivor of the former Ming Dynasty, and he was not originally a craftsman. He was quite wealthy and opened the store, not for profit, but with other profound intentions. However, because his goods were of high quality and the prices were low, his business was booming and his profits were abundant. Wang Mazi inherited his ancestor's business and followed the old rules in everything, but he devoted extra research to the manufacture of knives, striving for perfection. Whenever extraordinary people and chivalrous warriors came to buy, he would spare no effort to cast and forge them. Sometimes, he would become friends with the customers and would not accept payment. Over time, his wealth gradually dwindled, and he relied solely on business to maintain the store. Otherwise, Wang Mazi would have become a poor man long ago. After a hundred years of the founding of the former Qing Dynasty, few people in the old capital's society did not know the owner Wang of Dongsi. Because of his generosity and disregard for wealth, his reputation spread far and wide. Later, he became a famous expert in skills and had extensive social connections. However, his appearance was gentle and modest, quite unlike a boxer, let alone a blacksmith. Some said that the son of a worker starts as a worker, and his ancestors and fathers were originally scholars. Wang Mazi was a great hermit in the city, and he was not despised because of his occupation. In his later years, Wang suddenly had an epiphany. Whenever he opened the furnace to smelt iron, he would add a certain substance to the ore. After several refining processes, he would take it to make utensils. Among the utensils, the knife was the most famous, because the knife was the most common item used by martial artists, and Wang himself was also good at knife skills. Therefore, every knife he made was extremely hard and extremely sharp, and those who used it could handle it with ease, which was no ordinary product. It is a pity that our country's habits are such that every invention is intended to be kept secret, and absolutely no one is willing to disclose it. If the descendants are virtuous, they can continue it, but if they are unworthy, they will lose the true transmission. Is there anything in the world more regrettable than this? As for Wang Mazi's method of casting knives, its general outline still exists today, and it is not yet completely unrecognizable, but his descendants do not know the value of their ancestor's lifelong hard work, and only know how to turn to commercialization by cutting corners. Over time, his unique secrets will gradually disappear. Some people say that the knives made by Wang Mazi in the past contained some red gold. The gold is very hard, and the statement also makes sense. Therefore, in the past, all products that claimed to be treasured knives had to undergo more than a hundred days of manufacturing, costing more than a thousand strings of cash. The work was complicated, the capital was huge, and the value can be known. It is not an exaggeration to call them treasured knives.</p>
<p>The knives used by the executioners of the former Qing Dynasty's Ministry of Justice to execute prisoners were also made by the Wang family's old store. Since the Republic of China, the broadswords used by the broadsword brigades in the various armies of North China were mostly ordered to be manufactured because of its reputation. At that time, the broadswords cast by the Gongxian and Dezhou arsenals were indeed not as "hard," "skillful," "durable," and "sharp." Recently, the broadsword brigades in the national army included Han Fuju's troops in Shandong Province and Song Zheyuan's troops in Hebei Province. Not only were the entire teams known as brave warriors, but the martial arts skills of each team member were also extraordinary. Examining their history, they still belong to the legacy of the old Northwest Army's succession and replenishment. The Song's army is the 29th Army that fought hard at Xifengkou.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>Boasting After Decline</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>Little Tang fell, and since his father's speculative business failed, he lost a financial backing. His friends all witnessed him fall from the towering and luxurious peak of enjoyment, buried in a mud-like life, never recovering. This caused a sigh and criticism from his friends. Some said he was too absurd when he had money, and some said he underestimated money too much before. Although those who criticized him were the same people who had assisted his extravagant spending in the past, and who had encouraged him to run on the road to decline, they now turned their faces.</p>
<p>To a third party, one might sigh at the coldness of human relationships, but Little Tang himself didn't care about this at all. He happened to glimpse his "intimate friend" from two years ago by the fence of the night garden, getting out of a car with a woman and walking into the door. He thought with relief: "The friends I made have finally made a fortune, but why doesn't he come to see me? Oh, I'm really confused myself, wasn't my father's residence auctioned off? ... Walking east and west, without a fixed home, how can he find me?" He rushed forward to shout at him, but unexpectedly, a doorman hit him on the head with a stick.</p>
<p>Only then did Little Tang get angry. He retreated to the dark corner by the fence. He glared at the doorman and scolded: "You blind thing, have you forgotten opening the car door for me before? Don't you recognize Tang San Shao? You are familiar with my Studebaker every night, how dare you hit me, insult me? That friend's uncle is a lawyer..." He stopped scolding there. Little Tang had a new understanding: "Luckily I didn't shout at that friend, my appearance is unsightly, he has a woman next to him, that's too embarrassing for him, an intimate friend shouldn't..."</p>
<p>He told another partner that his friends were all so rich.</p>
<p>Picking up a cigarette butt on the street and sticking it to his lips, he recognized what brand it was. He also told his partner that he had a lot of experience with cigarettes. In the past, he had to have two tins of this brand every day, half of which were for treating guests. At that time, he would throw away half of a cigarette after smoking it. Now, now, it is "a dragon in the sand"! One day... However, Little Tang's stomach didn't approve of his boasting, and started to cause trouble and shout. Little Tang couldn't help it, and put on a pitiful look, "Sir, Madam, please have pity on me..." begging people.</p>

<h3>Effective Method for Quitting Smoking that Everyone Wants</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Once nicotine enters the body, it stimulates the blood to produce countless "platelets." These "platelets" can promote the vitality of each cell, so once you stop smoking, the "platelets" in the blood have no way to stimulate, and each cell loses its dependence and cannot function. The body feels very uncomfortable, and even cannot support it, falling into extreme pain. Those who have smoked for too long are more deeply anesthetized, so the weakness of the body is more severe. Even if you try to quit, you will inevitably give up halfway and fail to achieve complete success. Therefore, the safest method of quitting smoking is to use the nourishing and replenishing method of quitting smoking. The nourishing and replenishing method of quitting smoking can not only reduce the nicotine toxins, but also generate a kind of nourishing power. The various parts that were previously damaged by opium immediately return to their original state, so there is absolutely no pain during the process. The following quitter used this method to quit his fourteen-year smoking addiction, taking only a month or so, which can be said to be a safe and effective method.</p>
<p>Patient Zou Laiyi, from Hangzhou, Zhejiang, is now forty years old. He became addicted to smoking at the age of twenty-six. In addition, his body was inherently weak, so his smoking volume increased sharply. He smoked at least six qian of tobacco every day. The inheritance that Mr. Zou possessed in the past gradually declined due to the lack of control over his expenditure for fourteen years. His economy could not afford his smoking. He had tried to quit smoking once in the past year, but because of the hundreds of pathological changes during the quitting process, he resumed smoking halfway through. This spring, he was introduced by a fellow clan member to use the nourishing and replenishing method of quitting smoking, taking "Reproductive Essence" to increase the antitoxins in the blood, and injecting "Yu Wei Ci Baoming" to shorten the quitting period and reduce pain. In the first week of taking "Reproductive Essence," he reduced the amount of smoking by a quarter. In about four weeks, he smoked less than one qian of tobacco. He took "Reproductive Essence" for about a month, and he quit his fourteen-year-old addiction once and for all. His spirit is now strong, his weight has increased, and his complexion has become rosy.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Gonorrhea</p>
<h3>Good Method for Self-Treatment of Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, University of Hong Kong Medical School</p>
<p>Prostitutes are the main hub of venereal disease transmission, so people who like to frequent brothels are prone to leukorrhea. The reason is that the prostitute's vagina is unclean. The gonococcus in the vagina takes this opportunity to invade your urethra, so after an unclean intercourse, your glans will swell, urination will be painful, and a white mucus will fill the front end of the urethra, dripping non-stop. If you are not careful, you will infect your wife. If gonorrhea lasts for too long, the seminal vesicles will be greatly damaged, and there is a risk of losing fertility. The only treatment method for this disease is to take "Anti-Gonorrhea," a compound preparation of flavin and Vakxin. Flavin has the effect of penetrating the membrane and killing bacteria, and Vakxin can increase the body's ability to resist toxins. Whether chronic or acute, it is a good medicine for the symptoms.</p>
<p>Patient Lin Shuncai, from Mudu Town, Suzhou, has suffered from leukorrhea for two years. At that time, due to improper treatment, it changed from acute to chronic. Although he took many kinds of medicines in the middle, they were still ineffective. Sometimes, although he felt superficially cured after taking the medicine, it relapsed in less than a few months. Such repeated delays deepened the virus. This spring, after being introduced by a colleague to take "Anti-Gonorrhea," the symptoms improved, and the leukorrhea stopped completely. He took about four boxes, and was completely cured. The urine was clear. He has been cured for four months, and even if he overworks or walks too far, it will not recur as before. In total, he suffered from the pain of leukorrhea for two years. In addition to the mental and physical pain, he also suffered financial losses. Now that this kind of pain has been completely relieved, it proves the great effectiveness of "Anti-Gonorrhea."</p>
<p>Common Sense of Self-Treatment</p>
<h3>How to Save Young Men from Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Doctor Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Although masturbation is not a contagious disease, the number of young men suffering from it is constantly increasing. Almost everyone wants to try it around the age of fifteen or sixteen, but less exposure to pornographic pictures can help to avoid it.</p>
<p>The harm of masturbation, as openly discussed today, has been proven to contribute to neurasthenia and incomplete development. Because after masturbation, a certain amount of seminal fluid is bound to be lost. Moreover, after developing this bad habit, although one knows that it will damage the body and destroy the essence, one cannot resist the physiological stimulation and is willing to be a moth flying into the flame without realizing it. How sad is that?</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission mostly occurs due to masturbation, and neurasthenia is caused by nocturnal emission. Therefore, young men with the habit of masturbation will have a weakened seminal gate. In severe cases, they will have wet dreams at least ten times a month. Imagine, for such young men, it is difficult to maintain good health.</p>
<p>There are various types of neurasthenia, including mental fatigue, dizziness, tinnitus, palpitations, insomnia, night sweats, poor memory, and declining recollection. All of these are referred to as neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Recently, pictorial magazines and popular hygiene books have discussed the treatment of this condition, mostly focusing on stopping masturbation as the only solution. Indeed, the treatment of nocturnal emission requires complete abstinence from masturbation. But, after stopping masturbation, can the seminal gate and the body damaged by nocturnal emission automatically recover? Of course not. Therefore, the point of discussion in this article is to provide more advanced contributions, offering practical and effective guidance on the treatment of nocturnal emission and neurasthenia. Therefore, for those who suffer from nocturnal emission, whether due to physical weakness or caused by masturbation, the first step is to strengthen the seminal gate. After the seminal gate is strengthened, the mind will be firm, and nocturnal emission can be avoided. Therefore, "Hemetol's Semen-Consolidating Pills" should be used to treat nocturnal emission, and "Reproductive Essence" should be taken to reduce neurasthenia. This kind of remedy will bring many benefits to patients. Now, I will list them as follows: (1) Because of the rapid effect, the treatment period is shortened, which saves a lot of time; (2) The method of administration is simple, and the cost is reduced, which is very economical and beneficial to those with financial difficulties; (3) The medicinal power is great, and many famous doctors are willing to introduce and prove it, so as to avoid the patient's hesitation.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge of Bone Pain</p>
<h3>Healing Blood Impurities and Rheumatic Bone Pain</h3>
<p>— Doctor Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The term "bone pain" makes people shake their heads. Indeed, the onset of bone pain is quite frightening. It not only causes physical suffering but also mental distress.</p>
<p>Severe attacks can even render the whole body immobile, resembling a stroke. The incidence rate is very high among older people, accounting for almost nine out of ten cases. Therefore, most elderly people suffer from bone pain.</p>
<p>Why does bone pain occur? Besides early licentiousness and impure blood, rheumatism and overwork are also major factors.</p>
<p>The patient, Zhuang Shiyan, is 49 years old and from Changxing, Zhejiang. He resides in Yuqing Lane, Dong Tangjia Lane, north of the Old Garbage Bridge in this city. At the age of 24, he began to engage in a romantic sexual life, leading to impure blood. Coupled with excessive labor and long journeys, his stomach was exposed to the elements. As a result, rheumatism accumulated internally. In his youth, his resistance was relatively strong, so it remained hidden. In middle age, it took the opportunity to worsen. Initially, he only felt soreness in his lower back after work. At the age of 44, he felt numbness all over his body and unbearable soreness in both shoulders every time the seasons changed. Last winter, the condition became more severe, leading to hemiplegia, and the pain in his lower back became almost unavoidable daily. Fortunately, he was introduced by his fellow villager, Luo Jun, to take "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills," and his condition improved. After taking it for two consecutive months, his lower back felt comfortable, and his joints felt relaxed. More than a year has passed since then, and he has never had a relapse.</p>
<h3>Establishing the Curve of Beautiful Breast Development</h3>
<p>— Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The aesthetic concept of the 20th century is completely based on health. Therefore, women must reverse the weak and frail image of the past and strive for a strong, plump, and well-developed physique. When it comes to development, we know that it is closely related to health. Because incomplete development naturally leads to a weak body. Especially for women, good results during the years of development will result in high breasts, full hips, and strong legs and arms. Not only will the curves be revealed, but also diseases will be reduced. Therefore, a woman's lifelong health and happiness can be easily guessed by observing her breast development.</p>
<p>Moreover, women with well-developed breasts have strong pregnancy functions after marriage, and there is no need to worry about a lack of milk. The nourishment is also exceptionally rich, which is very beneficial to the fetus. Think about it, this is such an important thing that we really cannot afford to ignore it anymore.</p>
<p>Indeed, high breasts do increase beauty, but I think increasing a few points of beauty is secondary. In particular, it can strengthen the body and enhance resistance. Therefore, women who are committed to breast development are indeed successful in the study of "fitness and beauty." However, a weak body will lead to the atrophy of the gonads, so the breasts are shriveled and cannot swell and rise. At this time, the only remedy is to take a truly pure and high-quality female gonad preparation, "Female Reproductive Essence," to increase the internal secretion in the body and enhance the ability of metabolism. As a result, the breasts will develop richly and beautifully, and the foundation of curved beauty will be laid. So you will never regret it!</p>
<p>Marital Knowledge</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Erchang, Medical Doctor of the University of Pennsylvania, USA</p>
<h3>Remedies for Marital Weakness and Sterility</h3>
<p>Both husband and wife must have healthy bodies to form a happy family. This is a fact known to everyone and does not need to be repeated. However, from a medical standpoint, we should provide public guidance on how to maintain health.</p>
<p>From ancient times to the present, people lament the death of individuals from birth to death. However, those who are weak are bound to suffer from many diseases and pains and are prone to premature death. Therefore, everyone hopes to be healthy and is willing to spend a lot of money to seek ways to prolong life. Some people even collect precious medicinal materials such as ginseng, deer antlers, and fleeceflower root. However, how effective are they?</p>
<p>The modern scholar, Austrian physiologist Dr. Steinach, transplanted the testicles of sheep and rabbits into weak animals, which produced the effect of internal secretion and could achieve rejuvenation. Therefore, based on this point, he extracted the reproductive glands of strong animals to make the male "Reproductive Essence." After taking it, it can make the human gonads flourish, increase white blood cells and red blood cells. Whether it is congenital deficiency, acquired imbalance, or excessive sexual life after marriage leading to severe neurasthenia, it can be remedied by "Reproductive Essence." In our clinical practice, we have indeed relied on its great medicinal power and have never encountered failure.</p>
<p>Often, those who are strong before marriage become thin and weak after marriage, even unable to perform marital duties, or feel pale and prematurely aged a few years after marriage. The only remedy at this time is to take "Reproductive Essence" to strengthen the gonads and increase blood. This is the most complete and rational fundamental countermeasure. It has been proven effective repeatedly!</p>
<p>In addition, women's pregnancy problems must also be adjusted with the female "Reproductive Essence" to regulate menstruation. Because when sperm flows into the uterus, if the endometrium is congested before and after menstruation, proper adjustment will allow the fertilized egg to attach to the mucosa and gradually develop into a fetus. This is the reason for conception. "Reproductive Essence" can help promote women's ovulation function, because if women do not ovulate, no matter how many millions of sperm rush in, it will be in vain. Therefore, infertile women, or those with physical weakness and menstrual irregularities, can be completely cured in the short term after taking "Female Reproductive Essence."</p>
<p>However, fertility is the equal responsibility of both men and women. If a man is weak and underdeveloped, he will naturally not produce healthy sperm. Therefore, to avoid the trouble of sterility and make the hope of childbearing a reality, both parties must take this "Reproductive Essence" together. In order to ensure that both men and women have no regrets, the inventor has made it into two types, male and female. Now, countries are encouraging childbearing, so the drug is becoming more and more popular around the world.</p>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays</p>
<p>(1) Treatment of Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>The patient, Zhang Haisheng, is 21 years old, from Pudong, and resides at No. 7 Xinshun Lane, Tianji Road in this city. He works as an electrical materials salesman. He started masturbating at the age of 18, which led to neurasthenia. (Chief complaint) —— He has been masturbating for four years. Although he knows the harm of masturbation, he cannot abstain from it due to desire. Since January this year, his genitals have become increasingly sensitive. Although he felt sensitive before, it was not to an extreme degree. Now, even a slight stimulation will cause an immediate erection, which is quite painful. He also suffers from spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, fatigue, headaches, reduced thinking ability, night sweats, abnormal mental depression, and frequent nocturnal emissions. (Medical history) —— He knew about masturbation in school, but he had not tried it. After reading pornographic books, he was eager to try it. In the spring of 1931, he was induced by the outside world and began to masturbate. After practicing for a long time, he became addicted and did it frequently. (Current symptoms) —— His eyes are tired and dull, and his neurasthenia is very severe. He suffers from systemic malnutrition, relaxed seminal gate, emaciated muscles, and weighs only 88 pounds. (Treatment methods) —— Abstinence from masturbation, electrotherapy once a day, cooling the urethra, prostate massage, nourishing the body's deficiency with the gonad-derived preparation "Reproductive Essence" to reduce neurasthenia, and using "Hemetol's Semen-Consolidating Pills" to completely cure spermatorrhea and consolidate the seminal gate. Once the seminal gate is strengthened, the spirit will be sufficient, and the mind will also be calmed, reducing night dreams. He was completely cured in less than six weeks. Not only is his spirit full, but his muscles are also exceptionally strong, his appetite has increased, and his weight has increased to 108 pounds.</p>
<p>(2) Poor Genital Development</p>
<p>The patient, Jiang Shiming, is 21 years old, from Haizhou, Jiangsu, and resides in Weishui Lane, Ningbo Road in this city. His occupation is unknown. He started masturbating at the age of 15, and his development was greatly damaged, so his sexual organs are abnormally small. (Chief complaint) —— His genitals are short and small and he has phimosis. (Medical history) —— In school, he was induced by bad elements and practiced mutual masturbation. (Symptoms at the time of diagnosis) —— The penis is as thin as a finger, and the testicles and prostate are also abnormally small. He also has third-degree phimosis, with only a tiny hole at the front end of the urethra. (Treatment methods) —— Dr. Zhan performed the phimosis surgery, which was painless and completed in fifteen minutes. He also received electrotherapy every day, and the prostate area was massaged with special effective techniques for about three weeks. It gradually developed, and at the same time, he took "Reproductive Essence" internally to complete the development, which was completely satisfactory. Especially the most obvious thing is that the penis is similar in size when it is static and when it is erect. There is an increase in pubic hair, strong muscles, and weight gain, all with unexpected results. He is completely different from before.</p>
<p>Lower Back Pain</p>
<p>Although I am only 40 years old, I feel lower back pain every time after work. The most severe attack was last winter, and I could not move my arms. This spring, I had another major attack. I think if I don't cure it, it will be more difficult to cure when I get old. I sincerely ask for an effective treatment. I would be very grateful. (Zhao Tianmin)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can buy "Johnston's Bone Pain Pills" from Wuzhou Pharmacy to cure it.</p>
<p>Self-Treatment for Stomach Pain</p>
<p>I am 35 years old, and although I am in my prime, my stomach and intestines are not very healthy due to my weak constitution. Not only do I have frequent stomach pains, but my digestion is also exceptionally weak, so my body is malnourished, and I feel very depressed. In June this year, after being introduced by a friend to "Stomach Pain Relief" and "Digestive Pills," I miraculously eliminated my stomach problems of many years. I can be considered lucky. (Xu from Fukang Lane, Haining Road, North Zhejiang Road, this city)</p>
<p>Cured Leukorrhea</p>
<p>I have always been weak, and I often felt pain before I got married. After getting married last spring, my body became even weaker, and I even had leukorrhea. This spring, my husband and I bought a box of "Leukorrhea Relief" to use, and the leukorrhea stopped frequently. In less than four weeks, my lower body was exceptionally clean. (Xu Hongyu)</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>A year ago, I indulged in debauchery, which led to spermatorrhea and unbearable pain. Later, I bought several kinds of medicine from the market, and I felt better after taking them. Unexpectedly, it recurred this summer, with swollen testicles and premature ejaculation. What medicine can cure it completely? (Jiang Yongcun)</p>
<p>(Answer) You can buy "Anti-Lymph" from Wing On Company to treat spermatorrhea, and take "Reproductive Essence" to cure premature ejaculation and kidney deficiency.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>World Peace Congress</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Brussels on the 6th, the World Peace Movement Congress continued its meeting yesterday. After speeches by various celebrities, it passed a declaration and concluded its work. The most important statement in the declaration said that the sole purpose of this movement is to ensure that all nations in the world, regardless of their strength or weakness, share the joy of peace under conditions of complete equality. If any country violates international law and engages in aggression, thereby disrupting world peace, then we should treat it as the sole enemy, and so on. These words are so good to look at and so good to hear, especially for small and weak nations, who find them even more appealing and nod in agreement, ready to applaud loudly.</p>
<p>But looking back, there are many so-called things that hope for and guarantee peace, such as the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, the Locarno Treaties, and the Disarmament Conference. Have these paper talks ever achieved any real effect in guaranteeing peace? These grand and high-sounding clauses have long become waste paper, trampled on and torn up by aggressors. And now they want to hold this Peace Congress?</p>
<p>Let's not dwell on the past, and look at the present. Germany is building tanks on a large scale, currently has three tank divisions, and plans to increase this to eight divisions. It is also constantly thinking about reclaiming its old colonies. The United States has decided to follow Britain's example by retaining 40,000 tons of destroyers and strengthening its merchant fleet. Japan is actively preparing for war and expanding its aviation education; Britain is recruiting 24,000 new soldiers; France is extending its conscription period; Russia is reducing the conscription age. With this state of affairs before our eyes, can they even hear the call for peace?</p>
<p>When a person is seriously ill, they immediately hire a witch, ask someone to interpret characters, or ask a Taibao to perform ghost plays, but in the end, it has no effect at all. Some countries in the world, seeing that the world situation is bad and that a second world war is imminent, immediately launch a peace congress to oppose war. The result is the same as hiring a witch, interpreting characters, or hiring a Taibao. After the Ghost Festival, various places hold Yulan festivals to pray for peace in a village or township and to bless them not to suffer from diseases. The effectiveness of the Peace Congress is the same as that of the Yulan festival. This is truly extremely boring.</p>
<p>We Chinese people are superstitious, and foreigners are no less superstitious. Just look at the current Peace Congress, which is the same as our Chinese welcoming-the-gods festivals. Why is that? It is also a principle of people calling out to heaven when they are in trouble. In fact, the more they call for peace, the less peaceful it becomes, because the current world is a world where the strong prey on the weak. Only guns against guns, cannons against cannons, airplanes against airplanes, killing each other until the ghosts cry and the gods wail, fighting to the death, can stop it. Assuming that they call for peace and pray for peace, the general aggressors will regard it as cowardice, fear of death, and an opportunity to take advantage of. It is truly encouraging the ambitions of others and destroying one's own prestige, and the devil's hand will stretch out even further to snatch it away.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the current world, only war can stop war, only killing can stop killing, only power can stop power. Therefore, if you want to achieve peace through peaceful means, it will not be possible, and it will be even more dangerous. Those in the world who are dedicated to peace as a means and aim to avoid trouble at all costs can also think about its reasons.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Landlady (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>I told him what I saw, the landlady's sad face, and he opened his mouth, missing three teeth, and laughed loudly. —— How would you know? You... His laughter was swallowed by a violent cough.</p>
<p>—— Probably three years ago, the old cart driver said after calming down. The landlady's husband died, and she was the only one who took care of the store. But a young woman, looking like that, and having just lost her husband... Think about it, there are many businessmen coming and going. As time goes on, everyone has to say a few teasing words to her. Humph, it wasn't long before another cart driver quietly told me about her secret —— she had been hooked up with a peddler selling local silk who lived in the store. He also said something about seeing it with his own eyes. I didn't believe it at first, but later I saw how affectionate she was with that silk peddler.</p>
<p>This is where the problem came in. That young cart driver wasn't a good guy. I don't know what tricks he used, but he got his hands on the landlady too. Of course, there was bound to be jealousy. One night, that bastard cart driver tricked the silk peddler into the valley and beat him to death with stones —— only I know about this so far. So, that cart driver could eat alone, but people's mouths are always too bad. You say one thing, I say another, saying some improper gossip. The landlady could only pretend not to hear it and be done with it. That cart driver couldn't stand it. Many people probably wanted to fight him out of jealousy. Finally, one night, he ran away with a lot of the landlady's money and jewelry!</p>
<p>The landlady fell into the abyss of pain, and has been there ever since...</p>
<p>—— Isn't she still very young? I said:</p>
<p>—— I often joke with her sometimes, she says she hates men, heartless.... That old cart driver laughed again!</p>
<p>I knew why he was laughing.</p>
<p>He turned back and cracked his whip twice, and the carriage passed through a forest. He told me again:</p>
<p>—— After passing through the forest, and crossing a bridge, there is the famous Qilibu. There is a villa there. I will tell you something about that villa when we get there.</p>
<p>He didn't wait for me to ask him any more questions. He then:</p>
<p>"Get up —— Oh Oh!" He whipped the horse and ran away quickly. … (The End)</p>
<h3>Lessons from Autumn Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>There are two most annoying and terrible things in summer: flies and mosquitoes. These two small animals are produced in dirty places and reproduce extremely quickly. In the countryside, watching a ditch of wriggling larvae turn into winged mosquitoes that fly around and bite people in just a few days. Flies are said to lay eggs. I haven't seen their transformation with my own eyes, but they fly around everywhere in groups, and their reproductive power is no less than that of mosquitoes. Country people are the least concerned about hygiene. When students come to the square to promote fly and mosquito catching, although the children will surround them to watch the fun, the old people will grumble:</p>
<p>"What hygiene, no hygiene, we have lived to this age. Reading books will read out these tricks."</p>
<p>At that time, I was just reading textbooks in elementary school, and I also knew a little about the danger of flies and mosquitoes, but since the adults did not believe these ghost stories, our little bit of newly learned common sense was naturally useless.</p>
<p>Now I live in a big city, and my knowledge of hygiene has also progressed with age. Even if I don't go to the countryside to promote hygiene, I won't let those harmful flies and mosquitoes into my house casually. Once summer comes, I have two necessities in my house: fly swatters and mosquito coils.</p>
<p>But these small animals also learn to be smart when they come to the city. Flies don't fly around in groups, they adopt scattered tactics. As long as you don't pay attention, they hover over the dishes like airplanes incubating eggs, disappearing in an instant. Fly swatters are useless. As for mosquitoes, you only hear their buzzing, and after they bite you, you can't see their shadows. Once you light a mosquito coil, you don't even hear the buzzing.</p>
<p>After the beginning of autumn, the situation changes again. In the countryside, these things have already disappeared. They enjoyed a summer season and are now all rigid. There is no need for fly swatters and mosquito coils to exert their power, and they will fall on the table or somewhere else and die by themselves. But in the city, just when malaria is rampant, it is really puzzling.</p>
<p>Last night, I was reading under the lamp when a mosquito flew around my arm, like an eagle circling in the sky. It was searching for its target, so my gaze abandoned the black characters on the book and followed it in circles, wanting to wait for it to land on my arm and immediately send it to its death. It took a long time, and it gradually flew closer to my arm, but in an instant, it had bitten me, and the mosquito had disappeared somewhere. The bitten arm immediately showed a red bump, very itchy. I immediately applied mosquito repellent, and simply stopped reading, quietly waiting for it to fly back a second time, but it disappointed me until I couldn't keep my eyelids open. When I woke up this morning, I found four or five red bumps on my thighs, which were naturally its attacks again.</p>
<p>This gave me a big lesson: "Hygiene" cannot only be done when you see a lot of flies and mosquitoes. We must be hygienic anytime and anywhere until they have disappeared, so that we may suffer less next year. To put it more clearly, we are not afraid of them flying in groups, but we must pay attention to their sneaky attacks.</p>

<h3>Snake and the Poor Man</h3>
<p>— Rural Dweller</p>
<p>Old Zhang the Fourth loved talking about snakes the most, it seemed he had especially vast knowledge of snakes. As long as he had free time, once he started talking, he could go on for two or three hours, talking about green grass snakes, red rat snakes, black wind snakes, and even two-headed ones, four-legged ones, all vividly brought to life in his words.</p>
<p>I am most afraid of snakes, yet I really enjoy listening to people tell snake stories, and even more so, I often wanted to see the faces of strange and bizarre snakes. For example, the two-headed snake, I have never seen one. A slender snake body with two heads growing out of it, four small round eyeballs emitting light, two mouths with venomous fangs, two blood-red forked tongues, what a terrifying shape that would be. How can a snake grow two heads? I once heard Old Zhang the Fourth talk about it, extremely mysterious.</p>
<p>That autumn, I was staying at my uncle's oil mill in a small inland town. Old Zhang the Fourth was the town's messenger, making two rounds a day, having to get up early and work late. The afternoon was his freest time, when he would either 'lie like a corpse' (sleep) or 'sell words' (talk a lot). There were many letters coming and going at the oil mill, so he often stopped there, leaning his body against the stacks of soybean bags, crossing his right leg, and speaking animatedly. One day he talked about two-headed snakes—"After cutting a snake in half, you must bury it, otherwise, if two head sections happen to be picked up by crows and joined together, they will connect and become a two-headed snake, and they will take revenge."…</p>
<p>This saying was obviously too mystical; I didn't believe it, but I did believe that he had seen a lot of snakes. He had to travel forty or fifty miles of rural roads every day and cross mountain slopes overgrown with weeds. After the Awakening of Insects, snakes appeared on the roads. "One night!" he would often exclaim in alarm: "The moonlight was very bright, and I didn't bring a mast lamp. When it was almost time to rest my head, I was afraid of seeing the desolate graves beside the local temple, so I walked with my head down. Suddenly, there it was, lying across the road like a thick rope made of bundled meat. I kicked it unintentionally, and with a 'whoosh' sound, what do you think it was?…"</p>
<p>"It was a snake, right? How could it make a 'whoosh' sound?" I asked with a look of surprise and doubt.</p>
<p>"…What else could it be but a snake? A black wind snake, it darted away with a 'whoosh' sound, its body pitch black. I was barefoot, and if it had bitten me, my life would certainly not be guaranteed. The teeth of a black wind snake are more poisonous than arsenic. I would have died halfway, and even the ghosts wouldn't have known."</p>
<p>"Why don't you wear shoes? You must guard against snake bites when walking at night!"</p>
<p>"Young master: Poor people, where do they get so many shoes? It's like always owing road debts; even iron shoes would be worn through. I was born with a barefoot fate, and sooner or later, I'll be bitten to death by a venomous snake on the road." He glanced with his bloodshot eyes, then stretched his right hand behind his head, using it as a soft pillow. He yawned and said: "Alas, poor people are destined to walk the road!" This aroused teasing from several oil mill clerks!</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, doesn't your wife know how to make shoes? She can even make embroidered slippers... hehe…"</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, don't embarrass me. One day, when I, Zhang the Fourth, strike it rich, will she, that slut, have the face to see me? Unless I'm bitten to death by a snake in the dark, am I never going to amount to anything!" Then, without saying another word, his eyes drooped, and he fell asleep…</p>
<p>—Counting it, this was already five or six years ago.</p>
<p>This time, I stayed at my uncle's oil mill in the town for a few days again, but I didn't see Old Zhang the Fourth. According to the oil mill clerks, he had suffered from snakehead boils two years ago, and he had never recovered. He became as thin as a living ghost. Later, when the automobile road opened, the town no longer needed him to run errands. He couldn't stand on his feet, so he opened a pier. Thus, in the lonely afternoons, there was no one to talk about snakes anymore. As for myself, I am not as afraid of snakes as I used to be. After wandering around in the city for five or six years, running around for a living every day, on the bustling streets, I saw beggars holding live snakes and begging for money, some even shoving small snakes into their noses and letting them swim out of their mouths, doing all sorts of terrible things to get people to give them money quickly. In the city, poor people actually use snakes to earn a living.</p>
<p>I silently pray; may Old Zhang the Fourth not have sacrificed himself to the venomous fangs of snakes. Perhaps, if I have the chance, I will hear him tell stories again… However, this will probably only be a dream, right?</p>
<h3>The Child Without Milk</h3>
<p>— Already</p>
<p>The country woman who came from the back room suddenly disappeared, leaving only the child she brought with her crying. She arrived here before lunch. As soon as she entered the door, she put the child down and went out with the sister-in-law's husband and another man, in a hurried manner. She came back for a while at some point, alone. But after a while, her whereabouts were vague again.</p>
<p>Without knowing each other, she was completely a stranger in our family, except for the sister-in-law. Therefore, her movements did not attract anyone else's attention at all. If it weren't for the child's crying, which made us annoyed, everyone would have really forgotten her.</p>
<p>The child cried all night.</p>
<p>The next day, I saw my sister-in-law was very busy: cooking milk cakes, feeding tofu paste, washing diapers, carrying the child in and out, and sometimes humming out-of-tune lullabies, as if she had become a mother herself. At this time, we had discussions: "Who exactly is that country woman from the back room?" "Why did she disappear as soon as she came?" "How can a child who is breastfeeding be separated from its mother?" "I heard that the child was only a little over a month old when it was born."</p>
<p>That night—the second night, the child cried even more fiercely, with hardly a moment of rest. "Waa! Waa waa waa!" The sound was so mournful, like it was hungry and uncomfortable, and like it was sad for not being able to find its mother. My sister-in-law's out-of-tune lullaby hummed again. The more she sang "rock-a-bye," the more the child cried "waa waa."</p>
<p>After being disturbed by them for two nights, I couldn't bear it any longer.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law! Why does your child keep crying like this? It cried last night, and it's crying again tonight." I tapped on the partition wall with my hand.</p>
<p>"Sir! I'm really sorry. The child doesn't have any milk to eat, so it's been disturbing you for two nights in a row." The back room responded.</p>
<p>"Why doesn't it have any milk to eat? Her mother…"</p>
<p>"The mother went to be a wet nurse."</p>
<p>"Oh!" I was a little stunned: "Then what about her own child?"</p>
<p>"The child? We originally wanted to give it away, but the child's grandmother refused, so we plan to hire someone else to raise it."</p>
<p>"Waa waa waa" "…My little baby" rang out for a while.</p>
<p>"Why is it so troublesome? The mother is a wet nurse for someone else, and the child eats someone else's milk." I didn't quite believe her words.</p>
<p>"It's troublesome, but the family is poor, and there's no other way. This way, we can earn a little money to help with household expenses." She continued: "She is my younger sister."</p>
<p>"Earn money? Doesn't your own child still need a wet nurse?"</p>
<p>"Of course. But wages are high in Shanghai, ten dollars a month, while in the countryside it's only two and a half dollars, much cheaper."</p>
<p>"This way, you can earn seven or eight dollars more a month."</p>
<p>"More than that. Here, there is food and clothing, but in the countryside, it is sent to the wet nurse's home, so there is no need to provide meals."</p>
<p>"Then the child doesn't need to be brought here."</p>
<p>"That's because we're afraid the employer won't be satisfied. Who can guarantee it will be successful in one try?"</p>
<p>I understood everything: ten dollars took away this child's milk, and two and a half dollars occupied another child's milk.</p>
<p>The third night was even more crying. But because it was so tired from crying, it seemed to have fallen asleep for a while.</p>
<p>As soon as it dawned, someone from the countryside came to take the child back. The mother didn't even come to see her once. The sister-in-law gave her a bottle of tofu paste, which was prepared for the child to eat on the way. They left.</p>
<p>Then I thought of another question: Who will raise the child of the mother in the countryside who is being a wet nurse for this child?</p>
<h3>The Mute</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>Two farmers were hoeing in the cornfield on the river slope. It was an extraordinarily hot day in June around noon. Although there was a bit of river breeze, the tall sorghum stalks at the edge of the field blocked the wind for those who were hoeing half-bent and stepping backward. The younger one pulled the hoe to the end of this plot, then thrust it into the soft soil, pushed the large reed-woven hat to the back of his head, wiped the sweat from his forehead with his arm, and walked towards the sorghum field. The older one continued hoeing without stopping. He raised his head, saw that the young man had left the field again, and shouted with great displeasure:</p>
<p>"Little Pi, you're resting again?"</p>
<p>"Drinking some water."</p>
<p>Under a small mulberry tree, there was a red earthenware jar. Just as the young man was about to squat down, he:</p>
<p>"Hey, you you... what are you doing?"</p>
<p>Under the sorghum roots in the soybean sprout bush, a person was crawling, with terrifyingly long hair, a tangled mess covering his face, with a lot of grass clippings and dust stuck to it. Underneath the hair was a bare body, and at this moment, he was holding the jar with both hands and drinking water. The young man panicked a little. He was afraid that the person sleeping in the field was dead. This was a human life! He would have to report it to the authorities, pay for the coffin, and give gifts to the village chief... He scurried away in a panic, walked to the sweating old man: (To be continued)</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Singing Autumn"</p>
<p>Another year easily passes into autumn wind. Falling leaves are seen first rising onto the parasol tree. Fluttering golden wind, autumn arrives early. All things in the world respond to heaven's work. Ouyang Xiu, composes the essay on the sound of autumn. Early in the season alarms the autumn air that enters the curtain. Wang Yuyang, composes a poem that sings of autumn willow trees a beautiful story. Lingering tones stirring autumn feeling. Autumn comes, fearing the sound of the flute from the tower. Yu Xin in those years also with autumn in his chest. Playing autumn, loving to see the Dongting Moon. Autumn enters the Qiantang Moon, waves crashing. Autumn waters, that person cherishing old rains. Autumn wind, yellow leaves mourning secluded crickets. Chirping insect sounds accompany autumn. Memories of Autumn Sung and the taste of water shield. I think that, chrysanthemum arrogant lotus residual still requires autumn to be the master. Never mind that, autumn comes autumn goes, too suddenly. It is nothing more than, white duckweed red art in the autumn light. Painting this file of Dan Qing, should be considered the merit of autumn. Fragrant sweet osmanthus follow the autumn news. Under the eastern fence, autumn follows the flushed face reflected in the wine red. Slowly saying that, geese fly horizontally beyond the frontier, autumn wind rapid. Slowly saying that, people lean on the tower, autumn dew thick. Just watch that, literary gentlemen and elegant scholars sing autumn feelings. Autumn moon autumn splendor all can enter the poetry tube. Crickets travel by night autumn unconcerned. Mournful chirping weaving ladies night misty. Just that, the fifteenth of the eighth month, Mid-Autumn Festival. Is nothing more than, raising your head to look afar, singing autumn looks. Just that, holding a turtle facing the chrysanthemums, autumn radiance shining. Is nothing more than, autumn club essays decorate the work. Who has that, hall high curtain far autumn difficult to reach. Unimaginable that, autumn in the human world everywhere connected. That autumn water for spirit eyebrow Dai good. Lightly, ten points autumn moon also not enough to shine Qin Palace. Teachers and students love the autumn mountain good. Taking advantage of this autumn cool falling jade peak. Eyes before autumn adds poetic intent. But forgot, autumn news urging people to be annoyed, oh me. I today, briefly spread autumn intent, take it as a fishing flute. Autumn color deeply in this. Regardless that, swallows go geese come autumn color old. Learning and learning, Su Dongpo's autumn wind yellow leaves gave the poem to the old man. Hating and hating, recent autumn intent is endlessly thin. Turning to feel the autumn wind actually thicker. Autumn also, autumn also, I will count the song finished in the end.</p>

<h3>Postscript of the First Screening of "Carnival Night"</h3>
<p>Famous Director's Famous Saying on Lun, Many Stars Devour</p>
<p>The satirical book drama "Carnival Night," directed by the famous director Mr. Shi Dongshan, has been edited and completed. It was screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater on Tuesday morning last week at ten o'clock. Most of the viewers were Xinhua staff and related actors. After a full two hours of silence, seriousness, and suffocation, everyone stood up and stretched wearily, with joyful smiles on their faces. They all admitted that their efforts over the past few months had not been wasted! However, Director Shi was a dozing Kongo, propping his right hand on his forehead, sitting motionless in his seat. Everyone shouted: "Mr. Shi, Mr. Shi: Dongshan, what's wrong? What's wrong?" He then stood up lazily, without a trace of a smile on his face, which showed that he still felt dissatisfied with this film. Sure enough, his first sentence was: "Mr. Lu, I think we'll go to Suzhou tomorrow to reshoot some outdoor scenes!" But after the negotiations, he also revealed a happy expression, greeting everyone and saying: "Thank you for your hard work, ladies and gentlemen. These are just minor dissatisfactions. For the most part, it's still considered a success! It's getting late, let's go to Da Dong for lunch! Let's have a gathering." On the way to Da Dong, he pulled the reporter and made the following remarks; he said: "A film, from the beginning of filming to completion, is painstakingly done by the director; whether it sells well after it's shown is another question that can be set aside. Basically, the business eye and the artistic eye, in present-day China, seem far from reaching a proportional period! As for the criticisms of others, they can also be set aside. Basically, others have their own subjective views, so-called the wise see wisdom, the benevolent see benevolence. But at least before the official premiere, as far as I'm concerned, I must feel very satisfied, this is always worthy of my months or years of hard work, worthy of the audience who have come enthusiastically and paid a considerable price. Therefore, this has become my unwavering proposition, and especially this "Carnival Night," which I adapted from the work of the famous writer Gogol, I hope that in the final screening, there will not be a single shot that makes 'me' feel disgusted." His words reached this point, and the feet of the crowd moved to the second floor of Da Dong: A messy arrangement of tables, after moving chairs, I only answered him with a few simple words: "The current audience, for film knowledge, is indeed a lot of , on your film use more effort, the viewers will certainly also more effort to be identified it! Do not believe it, but watch the film after the premiere everyone's criticisms it's." At this time the clock reported a little: everyone's belly, has been singing empty city plan; So but wait for came, laid upon wolf swallow tiger eat, butchery door big swallow, as you are winter melon cup it, oyster oil beef it, put down a table, only a few seconds, it has wind roll left cloud, under empty dish empty bowl. Indeed, the people who participated this time, nineteen were all "Carnival Night" in the fellow sufferers of the same fate, basically without the need for courtesy and restraint, now let the reporter introduce to make this end: counting the director Shi Dongshan, recording Lu Yuanliang photography Yu Shengsan, starring Hu Ping, Zhou Xuan, Gu Eryi, Jinshan, and Wang Weiyi Shi Chao Yin Xiucen, etc.</p>
