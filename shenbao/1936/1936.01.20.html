<p>— 年</p>
<p>日來內外電訊均傳滂江集寗（平地泉）間已發生嚴重事態雖具體事實尚難明悉然當國人正注目於冀東察北交涉之際內蒙方面竟有此種警報傳來瞪以野心國家以往對蒙活動情形吾人不禁抱非常之焦慮矣</p>
<p>吾人焦慮之因不外二點　所謂內蒙古者在中國之領土中自東至西如遼黑熱察綏晋陜甘聳九省均與有密切關係今日除遼黑熱以外因此事件有發生糾紛與受到牽動之可能者尚有六省　內蒙六盟其中哲里木盟烏克昭盟卓索圖盟九一八後已被强隣改制析爲四興安省今日之問題乃在强隣更圖擴展致使自察綏至甘寗之錫林果勒·烏蘭察布·伊克昭等三盟發生動搖</p>
<p>依第一點觀察此事變之影響將使中國之外禍自東北延及西北自長白山脈延至黃河上游依第二點觀察强隣以九一八事變造成一東北僞組織卽就其中之內蒙三盟以作進行侵略內蒙全部之根基逐步進展程序顯明倘吾國於此决事變不爲適當之措置其延及西北當爲其必然之結果</p>
<p>雖然上述形勢係就整個的內蒙問題言之短期間內或尚不致實現而目前成爲吾國燃眉之急者則爲綏晋二省之被脅夫强隣軍閥浪人心目中之華北問題實包括冀魯察綏晋五省在內乃晋綏等當局不受誘惑使其計劃大受頓挫於是彼等憤嫉之餘出其偏師令李守信聯合蒙人保安隊由察西趨繞道滂江脅蒙王公共犯集寗遙制大同此種形勢一展地圖卽能明瞭故此事件在發縱指使之一方面實有二種作用就其根本言爲誘致全部內蒙之一步驟就其副作用言則藉以解决所謂華北問題耳</p>
<p>在形勢進展中吾人所望於中央及綏省當局者爲鑑於事件性質之嚴重以果敢之手段應付事變蓋二十二年六月以來之治蒙政策爲純粹內政問題之處置對於明達之蒙古盟旗仍屬適用而爲遏制與李守信偽軍合流者則不能不出以警告之手段傳聞綏軍已有準備謀阻偽軍西展惟望中央更有全盤計劃俾捍禦者有所遵循弗使綏束爲察東之續則以晋綏爲屛障西北安全庶有可言否則前鑑具在禍患蔓延豈有底止乎</p>

<p>— 兪慶棠主編</p>
<p>杭縣凌家橋的　土地關係及農業經營　郭人全</p>
<p>作者客居於凌家橋還不到兩個月。以下的紀述，大部分不過是作者從當地幾位老農談話中拾取來的幾件零星事實而已。</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>要明瞭凌家橋的概况，得先說一說凌家橋所屬的上泗區。上泗區位於杭縣的東南部，有一半的區界就是錢塘江的邊岸。全區分二十一個鄉，外加一個周家浦鎭。區內有許多聳起於地面的小山，山的面積統計的十萬畝，佔全區總面積三分之一。稻田的面積反只有九萬畝弱。在這九萬畝稻田中，據十分可靠的估計，有百分之六十以上是被杭州市區內的官商們所佔去的。因此僅靠這九萬畝田所能出產的十四——十五萬石米，除去了五萬——六萬石租米以後，就很難養活全區內四萬九千口的農民。飢餓之神驅使這批農民向山地開發，種茶栽竹便成為本區農民主要的副業。全區茶山和茶地計的二萬六千畝，竹林亦有一萬四千餘畝。畜養方面的蠶業和養鴨，在本區某幾鄕的農家生計中也佔着重要的地位。特別値得提出的是養鴨，在新蘭鄉，許多林戶簡直就把它當做唯一的主業。他們多數住在錢塘江邊的沙灘上，住的是茅屋，當你走近他們的住宅時，在幾百步路之外就能聽見『呷！呷！呷！』的聲音不斷的從茅蓬中送來。</p>
<p>凌家橋，這一個二百五十戶左右的農村，就位在上泗區中的一鄉——定山鄉的中心地點。因為牠的地位適中，交通又很方便，杭富公路通過這裏，離杭州只消四十分鐘），政敎機關如督導員辦公處，田賦徵收處及發照處。浙江省立實騐民衆敎育館等，都設在這裏。同時，因為在凌家橋附近沒有較大的市鎭，在這裏也開設有幾爿小商店，如茶社，藥舖，理髮店，雜貨舖等，這似乎不是純粹的農村了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>在二百五十戶左右的村戶中，有一家地主有田的百畝，有五六家較大的自耕農兼地主各有田三零——五零畝。餘下的農家，能有幾畝自田種種，就算是萬幸的了。足有半數以上的農家，他們種的純粹是租田。僥倖的是他們大都自己有幾畝或幾分山坡，只要那山坡不是滿佈着無從開墾的石頭，便都已墾熟而種上了茶樹。農家大部分的支付，都依靠森季裏賣茶的所得，純靠幾畝租來的稻田，恐有多數農家是連糧食都不够維持的，因此茶價的高低實為凌家橋農民生命之所繫。今春茶價此往年較差，它給予多數農家的威脅已不小了。</p>
<p>凌家橋農民所種的租田，和上泗區的其他各村同樣，絕大部分是杭州市區內的官商們所有的。遠在五十餘年或八十餘年前，那些官商們，委托了可靠的人，來本村大批地收買。『田地是子孫萬世的產業』，官商們都具有這樣的瞭解，將他們的括民所得投放到鄉間來，滿挿了牢固的，持久的吸血網。他們支出的是稀少的白銀（那是只十餘元一畝），收進的却是歷年不絕的白米。正為了他們的目的是「白米」，因此當他們收買的時候，往往不注意到田的所在及好壞。有些農民為了窮苦得沒法，希得較多的田價，竟有把三畝當作四畝賣的；買田的人只要能收到四畝的租米，又何必去追問那塊田的實際大小呢？</p>
<p>收租人要的是租米，這些佃農只要不欠租米，就可永久享得耕種權。作者曾訪問過許多農民，問他們某坵稻田租種的年限時，他們的回答往往是：『還是祖父賣出的祖產，已種了六七十年了』。這種事實上的永久耕種，但並未形成所謂永佃權。『民客田』『大小賣』等名目，這裏的農民從未聽到過。當他們窮苦得繳不出租米時，就只能眼巴巴望着稻田讓旁人去種。他們常常恐慌着：繼不出租，撤了佃，將如何呢？</p>
<p>城市地主們的租田，租額是有一定的，每畝從五斗－一石不等，普通是六斗－八斗。二五减租在這裏總算能切實遵行。民十六以前照實織租，民十六－十八三年估計全收穫量按三七·五％繳租，民十九起取消估計全收穫量辦法，依照各租田原定租額，打七五折繳租。</p>
<p>本村的一家地主及五六家富農，共計也有百七八十畝田放租在本村的貧農層裏。有些村內的小地主，洞悉村內的貧農是如何迫切地需耍土地，因此他們所收的租額就比較重些，或為四（地主）六（佃戶）分租，或則講定租額，但無二五减租。因為他們自身戚覺到田賦的負擔並未减輕，且在繼續增高呢！。</p>
<p>近五年來因受國際帝國主義的糧食傾銷之壓迫，全國各地穀價在跌，因而影響地價，凌家橋自亦不能有所例外。但茶地的價格，近五年來反形增高，這是本地茶葉銷路增加的關係，可視作本地的一個例外：</p>
<p>每畝稻田價格　每畝茶地價格</p>
<p>現時　五年前　現時　五年前</p>
<p>最高　九〇元　一二〇元　九〇元　五〇元</p>
<p>普通　四〇元　八〇元　四〇元　二五元</p>
<p>最低　一〇元　四〇元　一〇元　一〇元</p>
<p>對於茶地，農民視為致生要道的『後起之秀』，儘管價格高漲，普通農民絕少脫售。現在，還是稻田的賣買比較普遍。隨着田價的跌落，田的集中趨勢並未稍衰。凌家橋有一商家，以其經營茶葉賣買所得之盈利，在最近五六年問，就從本村農民賣進三十餘畝田。城市內的大地主，鑑於農民運動風潮高漲，租額减少，雖欲脫售其土地，但在這年頭希望農民來買進田地自屬夢想。因此，大地主敝屣其土地的意識，並非卽能减削土地問題意義之嚴重。（未完）</p>

<p>最富興趣者、當為港滬埠際足球賽、此項香港隊人材極盛、因李惠堂之參加、使該隊奪得埠際錦標之希望益強、而球迷亦將因李惠堂之來、而特感興趣焉、</p>
<p>上海埠際隊、昨日舉行二次試賽、理想隊竟以二比三敗於英尼斯、正式人選、有待公佈、觀兩次試賽所給予吾人之印象、上海恐非香港之敵也、華北足球隊之來滬、與上海中華隊作出席亞林比克之初步預選者、年來北地足球漸見發達、當有良好表演、</p>
<p>高麗足球夙稱發達、前年上海西聯足球錦標東華隊征韓、曾吃兩次敗仗、此次該隊旅　來滬、將與上海中華、華北、及港滬埠際隊之西聯隊等比賽、</p>
<p>三隊在滬、作一星期之交戰、延平路申園足球場、當為球迷於春節中娛樂之聖地、茲將秩序　錄如下、</p>

<p>埠際足球試賽失望　理想隊竟慘敗　二比三敗於英尼斯　整個球隊全無合作</p>
<p>滬港埠際足球上海隊昨舉行二次試賽、理想隊於昨日下午三時特約英尼斯作第二度試騐、藉以觀察者各個球藝、以便决定代表、慕名前往作壁上觀者、約三千餘人、英尼斯昨日賽來表演異常精採、尤以卡崙獨中三球包辦全局甚屬不易、上半時理想隊失去一十二碼機會、被英尼斯以二對一佔先、下半時開賽後、理想隊仍無滿意之表演、英尼斯則全軍用命、攻入一球、最後英尼斯麥奎特犯規理想隊罰進一球、結果為三對二、理想隊敗於英尼斯、</p>
<p>理想隊表演失望</p>
<p>理想隊隊員、十分之九、將為正式之埠際代表、故昨日之失敗於英尼斯、非但出於球迷意料之外、亦使選擇委員大吃一驚、整個球隊之表演、在水準之下遠甚、前鋒毫無合作可言、因霍和之不　、頓使前鋒失落靈魂、麥遠幾不知所措、李甯亦不如平日、考斯泰上半時尙佳、下半時亦軟若綿羊、二球門則俱有出色表演、尤以史梅頓大受贊賞也、</p>
<p>英尼斯先聲奪人</p>
<p>三時未至、雙、疏鬆腳頭、迨裁判員裘拉姆銀笛聲起、即列陣而戰、理想隊先取攻勢、球出　威腳下撥動、柯拉沙互相呼應、谷納爾施下解數、半途截下、　送開墨爾、運球前方、幸李寗救駕有功、未遭蹂躪、麥金台邊陲入寇、與卡崙一搭一擋、大刀闊斧、連下三道防綫、逼入理想隊腹地、卡崙不慌不忙、臥地一掃、球滾滾入網、首開記錄、英尼斯得手後、氣　甚　、卡崙馳奔滿場、勇冠三軍、從此球勢常在理想隊境內徘徊、險象環生、幸李寗休脫左擋右攔、救出不少險球、厥功殊偉、禿子霍威坐鎮中央、率領三軍、浩浩蕩蕩殺向前去、短　小　、提腳力射、被史梅頓　出、接着柯拉沙又過高而不入、陳鎮和邊陲起義、陳倉暗渡、偷傳鮑塞利踢入、惜越作廢、霍威崛起中軍、砰然一腳鮑塞利趕上、頂上開花、造成和局、</p>
<p>上半時落後一球</p>
<p>理想隊行軍得利、聲勢大盛、賈幼良揭旗邊域、進兵中央、鮑塞利凑上一頭、卒被史梅頓揮拳擊出、小黑炭東山再起、又遭阻擋、史梅頓表演精彩、高擋低攔、救出危球不少、自此英尼斯門前敵踪四佈、卒因丁麥克樂犯規、判　十二碼、誰知考斯坦罰來太偏、擊中門柱彈　、此球不入、理想隊仍不氣餒、我行我素、柯拉沙　整軍容、單槍匹馬、闖入敵營、拉起毛腿、球入網角、又因小賈越位取消、考斯坦後防接應、遠射未成事實、敵將麥克法蘭、統兵浩浩蕩蕩殺來、李寗阻之不及、敵勢囂張、危機四伏、幸曼萊腳頭欠準、踢成野球、小黑炭乘虛而入、暗令小賈接應、幼良　底綫處傳球中央、柯拉沙頭頂迎個正着、究因霍威年老、腳步遲滯功虧一簣、霍威擬將功抵罪、不計利害、單騎長驅直入、進逼英軍境內、又未告成功、此時英將開　爾足踝受傷、負痛作戰、而勇氣百倍、躍起一蹴、被白賽仲揮出、卡崙從人眾中奔上建功而返、未幾笛聲長鳴、結果上半時英軍以二比一佔先</p>
<p>三比一形勢更劣</p>
<p>過後、雙方易地再決雌雄、英尼斯氣　萬丈、節節進逼、霍威不為所動、仍案若泰山、率領諸將、搶營刦寨、舉兵殺去、遭麥樂兄弟阻擋、鮑塞利斜裏穿出、仍未建功、卡崙崛起邊疆、毫不留情、舉足力射、白裏仲　　一躍、接住阿斗、化險為夷、小黑炭雄風依然、帶球闖陣、未過三關、麥克樂兄弟未雨綢繆、奈出阻住、小黑炭有法無施、再度舉兵、巧施調虎離山計、偷渡敵陣、由鮑塞利轉　霍威、霍迎以禿頭、惜過偏未中、卡崙揭竿運兵、連闖三關、頭頂腳踢、均被向賽仲阻回、曼萊東山再起、逼入理想隊腹地、卡崙趕上、砰然一聲、踢在白賽仲身上、二人同時跌倒、幸未失守、俄而曼萊受傷、卡崙侵兵犯境、更得柯伯麥金臺左右協助、射入一球、成三對一、</p>
<p>臨了一隻十二碼</p>
<p>時英尼斯前鋒五將、個個賣力、聯絡純熱、其中尤以卡崙馳奔滿場、精神百倍、曼萊負傷運球、尙能如意、與卡配爾搭檔、殺奔前敵、白賽仲見勢不佳、趕忙奔出擋住、未遭殘踏、柯伯坐鎮中央、指揮三軍、儼然大將風度、獨自身先士卒、單刀直入、何奈腳頭欠準、未中鵠的、小黑炭見盡是敵人勢力、不由忿火中燒、孤軍進逼、一路衝去、麥奎特眼看不濟、挺身擋駕、不慎犯規、判罰十二碼、考斯坦恐再踏覆轍、罰來小心翼翼、果然不負眾望、一舉成功、未幾時間已屆、鳴金收軍、總結果三對二、理想隊敗北、此次理想隊全軍聯絡尙臻佳境、其失敗主因、在上半時失去一十二碼機會、隨鑄成大錯、又曾兩度攻破敵門、均因越位作廢、不然不難一鼓作氣、擊敗頑強之英尼斯、茲錄兩隊陣綫如下、</p>

<h3 id="c184">世界石油供需狀況（續） <a href="#c184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— 何冰</p>
<p>世界石油供需狀況</p>
<p>就因為石油在軍需工業上佔有重要地位，所以在世界資本主義各國均感到工業不景氣的時候，而石油工業卻有相當發展。石油工業的盛衰，隨各種自動車，飛機，汽船等數量而定。在一九三一年世界自動車數計三五，七八四千架，因經濟恐慌的關係，以後兩車略形減少，一九三二年為三三，六〇三千架，一九三三年為三三，三三一千架，自至一九三四年，因戰機的急迫，各種自動車又見增加，計三千四百九十萬架，較一九三三年增加百分之八，需要石腦油六千七百五十萬瓲，比一九三三年增加百分之六·九。據巴黎景氣調查所的報告，四大資本主義國家新製輕自動車登記的指數，有如下表（一九三三年計為一〇〇）：</p>
<p>國別　一九三三年　一九三四年</p>
<p>美國　一三六·二　一七三·三</p>
<p>英國　一一九·七　一四八·三</p>
<p>法國　一〇八·一　一一一·五</p>
<p>德國　一九九·五　三一八·四</p>
<p>一九三四年石油的需要雖然增加，但有一個矛盾的現象，即石油的價格卻見低落，尤其是石油製造品的價格，更為慘落。其中主要的原因是由於各國石油自給政策的激化，國際石油托辣斯間的傾銷　爭，以致石油的需要量數之增加，而價格反而趨低，因石油市場的崩潰而最受影響的是世界最大的石油生產國的美國，政府雖積極努力於石油市場的統制與生產的安定，並發佈了石油業法，但効力並不顯著。</p>
<p>一九三四年世界石油產額增加，美國的產額佔到全世界百分之六十以上，世界其他各托辣斯間，對於世界石油資料的再分割，以及販賣市場的　爭，愈形尖銳化起來，一九三四年伊拉庫新油田開始發掘，更加甚了托辣斯間的　爭。各國間一方面為了發展本國的石油業及石油精製事業，同時為了戰時的準備，所謂「石油國策」「石油獨立政策」，或「石油自足自給政策」急　發展，原有石油市場的供需關係破壞，石油生產過剩以及石油不足之間的矛盾，不能調和起來，因而需要增加，而價格反跌。世界石油產額及其需要額，近年來的趨勢，有如下表：</p>
<p>世界石油之產額與需要額</p>
<p>年份　生產額　需要額　生產超過</p>
<p>百萬噸　指數　百萬噸　指數　需要數</p>
<p>（百萬噸）</p>
<p>一九三四年因受美國的石油業法的刺激，生產額增加很大，一九三三年與三四年合計，生產超過需要計有千八百五十萬　之巨。</p>
<p>世界石油製品的價格的跌落，有如下表：</p>
<p>世界石油製品平均價格指數（一九二九年—一〇〇）</p>
<p>年份　石蠟油　燈油　瓦斯油　重油</p>
<p>意大利的石油問題</p>
<p>今日世界石油戰爭中，佔到最重要地位的，自然是美國，因其生產量佔到全世界百分之六十以上，但在今日，因意阿戰爭而引起國際對意禁油問題，以致意大利的石油問題，比較更引起時人的注目。</p>
<p>意大利的石油與石炭一樣，曾經專家多次試掘，耗費了政府很大公欵，結果探出本國並沒有石油資源，意大利每年在本國所採得的僅數千　劣等石油，而其所費且比普通的高百分之〇·三。所以，意大利對於戰時如何取得石油供給來源，保障石油不致缺乏，曾費很大努力。</p>
<p>因之，意大利為發展其本國的石油精製工業，以各種方法向各國謀取原料的供給，先從阿爾巴尼亞政府取得當地石油開採的獨佔權，又撰取了羅馬尼亞的石油採掘權，伊拉庫新油田發見後，意大利也是國際利權國中的有力的一員。</p>
<p>據意大利政府的估計，依照原定計劃，到一九三六年，從阿爾巴尼亞可得二十萬瓲原油，從羅馬尼亞預定可輸入三十萬瓲，伊拉克庫方面更可有四五十萬噸。如此，則意大利本國自用百分之五十外，還可有餘。如這計劃成功，則意國對於各國的石油貿易政策，即將更變，便是極力提高石油製品的輸入，以發展本國的石油精製業，統製本國的石油市場。</p>
<p>近年來意大利石油精製業逐漸發展，其趨勢有如下表：（單位千噸）—</p>
<p>一九三四年，意大利的石油市場，因受國際托辣斯的激烈競爭，本國石油業頗受壓迫，故生產量頗見減少，石油製品的輸入，年見發達，有如下表：（單位千噸）</p>
<p>觀上書，可知意大利與他國在石油貿易關係上之深刻，欲做到「石油自給國策，」殊非易易。一九三五年一月一日開始，實行石油製品輸入定額許可制，以二年為限，這時間內，積極發展本國石油工業，並頒佈新石油業法，以期發展本國工業，並做到自給地步。但一九二五年意阿戰爭開始，石油禁輸，反成為國際經濟制裁中的有力工具，如戰爭繼續，各國真能做到禁油，則意大利的石油恐慌，自必即將發生。</p>
<p>對意禁油問題，現在尙無結果，而列強間已糾紛橫生，如一九三五年十一月十八日國聯通知對意禁油後，蘇聯羅馬尼亞雖表贊同，而加拿大已表示反對。世界最大產油國美國，發表所謂中立，又有所謂對國聯的精神支持，並無具體決定，但這事卻引起意大利法西的極大反響。如去年十一月十八日法西大評議會緊急會議議決，　如國聯委員會禁止會員石油輸出，意大利即刻退出國聯，對於制裁國斷絕國交，撤回使領，　意國空迦一百二十五名組成決死隊，轟炸地中海上英國海軍的精華，空軍將領抱必死決心，致採英國地中海艦隊全滅。不久，意大利駐英法的大使，又分致抗議，其要旨即說，如英法實施禁油，意國即以戰爭行為報之，於此亦可見意大利對於石油的恐慌，以及石油在戰爭中所佔地位之重要了。而英國畢竟在歐洲方面，仍願保持意國原有的地位，及對於遠東問題的顧慮，德國規模宏大的重整軍備，對於意國不欲相適太甚，故禁油問題志不在求其實現了。（完）</p>

<p>棉花為中美二國主要農產品之一。以美國言之，其產棉量，佔世界總產額百分之五十以上，每年之出口棉值約達五十萬萬美金，佔出口總額百分之十六左右。以中國言之，棉產居世界第三位，每年產額約在八百萬擔左右，輸出量約為六七十萬擔。如以民國二十二年為例，棉花出口共七二三·六三二擔，共值三〇，二三八，九五八元，佔出口總值百分之四，九四，第六位。此二國棉產既佔如此重要之地位，則棉花產銷制度之研究與改進，實屬不容忽視。美國改進之途徑雖有種種，合作方法實佔重要之位置，二十餘年來經政府，學術團體，金融界，與農民等之共同努力，成效甚為卓著。反觀我國，近年來棉花產量日減，洋棉進口激增，生產技術毫無改革，運銷制度積弊叢生，長此以往，必致危及棉農生計。政府當局與一般有識之士有鑒於是，遂共起而　挽救之道，棉業統制委員會，各省之棉產改進所，華北農產改進社，以及各地所設之棉花運銷合作社等，遂相繼產生，惟是棉產改進，非一時所可收效，而棉花運銷之改進則較易為功。美國棉花運銷制度在革新前之種弊端，頗多與我國相似之處，而其所以謀補救此弊端之合作運銷制度！又有若干可適用於我國者，受搜集有關美國棉花合作運銷之資料，輯為斯篇，聊備國人從事棉運者之參考云耳。</p>
<p>（一）美國原有棉花運銷制度之缺點</p>
<p>欲明瞭　美國棉花運銷合作之制度，必先探究其　原有制度之缺點，茲擇其要者縷述如下：</p>
<p>（甲）軋花</p>
<p>（一）軋花費用　棉農多無自備之軋花機器，及棉花採集乃送往私營之軋花廠，代為軋成皮棉。軋花廠之目的在營利，故必儘量提高軋花費用，每百磅籽棉約需美金三角至五角。棉籽在棉農視之為量過少，多不向廠家索取，而廠家集少成多，又可得額外之收入。</p>
<p>（二）軋花品質　私營軋花廠所用之機器類多腐朽，效能减低，軋花時每不能將棉絨與棉籽分別清楚，有時且　雜泥沙等不潔物，皮棉之品質减低，因而損及棉花之售價。</p>
<p>（乙）棉花品質之不分棉花銷售之初，本無所謂分級，僅憑樣品交易。及後棉織工廠日漸發達，需用各色品質一律之棉花，以供紡織各種棉織品之需用，故棉花市場中亦漸次發生分級辦法。惟其始只是各憑主見，任意分劃，毫無一定標準，購主往往故意抑低所購棉花之等級，從中取巧，輒易引起雙方之爭論，一九二三年美政府農業部農業經濟局（Bureau　of　Agricultural　Eononics，U.S.D.A　）乃制定一通用棉花分級標準法（Universal　Cotton　Staudard　Act），依棉花市塲之結果，證明咸以米達林棉（Mi　ddlingCotton）為最高之品級，在此品級以上之棉花，亦不能售得較高之價格，在此種運銷制度下棉農必不願生產長絨棉，以增加起擔負。因棉絨愈短，則生產費不若長絨棉之高，而其皮棉之收成數，反較長絨棉為高，茍棉價既不依品質之優劣而分，則棉農必皆競植短絨棉，棉花之品質，因以日形降落。</p>
<p>（丙）中間人之漁利棉花自生產者達消者，所經過之層次甚多費有軋花販，棉花販，棉花店，棉花客，棉花棧，代售處等，每經一階段即受一次剝削，故棉農所得之棉價因以虧損。</p>
<p>（丁）棉花　雜與作弊　如棉農以籽棉售於軋花販，則彼於軋花時，故意於機中留一空隙，而圖意外之收入。亦有於皮棉中加入水分，其最多者可加水分百分之二十至三十。即謂軋花販不如此作弊，然當棉花轉入其他中間人時，難免其如此作弊也。</p>
<p>以上所舉之弊端，僅其　　大者，然已足以見改革之殷切，合作運銷制度遂應運而生。按美國棉運合作組織本有各州合作社與全國聯合會（即美國棉產交易社）二種，茲依次述明其概況如右。</p>
<p>（二）各州棉花運銷合作社</p>
<p>（甲）原則與政策　各州棉花運銷合作社咸為無股金無利潤之社會。蓋合作社純為服務性質，無需有耗費巨資之設備，舉凡一切運費，保險費，利息，營業等費用，皆按社員交運棉花之數量分攤之。如合作社社員多限於某區域內或某州之居民，有時限於某特殊農民團體之社員可加入，例如亞堪薩斯棉花產銷合作社必限於農民協會之會員始可加入。社員入社員需繳入社費，有規定一次繳足十元者，有規定按其個別之運銷量每包徵以二角五分錢者，此外並需簽定合同二紙，一為組織合同，其上訂明本組織之目的與原則，經營計劃社員資格等。一為運銷合同或稱契約，內載簽定合同雙方之責任權利，期限等，如社員違約不交運規定之棉花，則合作社需處以每磅之罰金三分至一角，契約年限多為五年，以前之鐵甲契約（IronClad　Contract）規定在訂約期間社員不得自由退社，其後加以修正，凡欲退社者須於每年五月第二個星期三之前用書面通知合作社，經負責人查明核準後，即可解除契約關係。</p>
<p>（乙）結構與管理　各州合作社為集權式，僅有一中央組織。各地方無分社之設立，但將所轄之地域劃分為若干區，各區設辦事處，所有一切訂立契約及地方設立之軋花廠堆棧等，皆由合作社直接管理之。合作社之管理機關為理事會，理事皆由各處農民選舉之，其法先就各區作預選，然後再就代表中選出理事。每社員只有一投票權，所以防止操縱。各理事皆為無給職，惟於開會期間酌貼車馬費。除理事會外，並指定社員三人至五人成立社務委員會，執行日常社務。合作社設主席一人，副主席一人，文書會計各一人。為提高經營效能起見，社中特分為會計，財務，推銷，服務等部，各部委部長一人負責辦理之。</p>
<p>（丙）經營方法　（子）收花與取樣　各區辦事處於棉花採集時期，派收花員向棉農收集棉花運至最近之壓榨所。（Cinoress）由辦事處派人抽取樣品，鑒定其品級。棉農如需欵孔殷，此時即可息借棉價若干。另一法則係由社員自行打包後直接送至合作社指定之倉庫，或交由鐵路局運至指定之倉庫，由倉庫管理人在每包之兩旁各取樣一個。所有樣品，皆送至合作社總辦事處，由社聘請曾受訓練並領有執照之棉花分級員（Cotton　Classers）加以　　　　，簽發品級證明書，合作社乃將同品級之樣品歸倂一處，並登記各社員交來各級棉花之包數。</p>
<p>（　）　藏—棉花為一種耐久性農產品，故其貿易期間較長，茍能善為　藏，待價而估，則必能獲得較厚之利益。美國各州棉花運銷合作社多無自建之堆棧，而係向私營堆棧租用。其故為　建築堆棧所費過鉅。　私營堆棧之設備與效能已甚完善，利用合作社力　與之　價，更可得優待之條件。　如無充分棉花以供儲存，則不能儘量利用，徒耗財力。</p>
<p>（寅）調劑金融　合作社所需之費用，約可分為三大類：</p>
<p>運銷組織之營業費用—又可分為永久之設備費用（如房屋用具等）與經常之營業費用（如薪俸，佣金等），前者係由按運銷量而提取之公積金項下撥用，後者係由各社員所納之佣金之給充。</p>
<p>（二）運銷活動上所需之費用—如社員預付棉值，運輸費用等。其所需數額之多寡，依　收進棉花之包數，　預付棉值之成數，　市場價格之高低，　運費率之高低等，因子而決定。合作社既為無股金之組織，故必向銀行或政府機關告貸，以棉花棧單提貨單等為擔保品。</p>
<p>（三）對於社員生產上或其他方面之接濟—美國南方棉農多數為佃農，自有資金甚少，在棉花生產時即感無力購置肥料種籽，且多有向當地商人賒用生產上之用品，或向小銀行借欵，而以青苗為抵押品。合作社對於此種社員必予以金融上之接濟，以解其困。為應付此需要，各社有成立附屬之金融公司，發行股票募集資金，貸放於社員。</p>
<p>（卯）銷售與計算貸欵　合作社設有推銷部，任經騐豐富之一人為部長，亦有另設一附屬之公司獨立經營者。合作社售棉方法有二，第一為混合銷售或稱合賣均分法（Pooling），係將社員棉花同等級者合為一處，陸續出售至一合賣期限（有一日，一星期，一月，一年等種）終了時，以各級售棉總包數除各級之總售價，得每包之平均價格，再按各社員之交運各級棉花包數分配之。（惟需先扣除各項應攤費用）第二即為單獨銷售法，由交運棉花之社員自定其銷售時期及最低價格，除去運銷費外，接受其剩餘之棉價，但此種辦法，係屈就不願加入合賣之棉農，及其後棉農認識合賣之利益後，無不願放棄其主見，故個別銷售之事已日漸减少矣。棉花銷售之對象為國內外各大棉織工廠，　社派代理人駐各大棉市負推銷之責。自美國棉產交易社成立後，各州合作社多有委託其代為銷售者。</p>
<p>（辰）軋花　私營軋花廠之弊端前已詳言之，但合作社之辦理軋花業，務則係在最後完成。因係中央集權式之組織，各地方合作軋花廠，皆由總社監督指揮，派人管理，棉農只有使用權，軋花廠設立之地點，一方面需顧及軋棉量之多寡，另一方面需考量距離各社員之遠近。社員交入籽棉請求軋花者亦取以少量費用。自合作觀點言之，軋花廠之功效頗大，因在中央集權式組織，社員與社間相隔甚遠，無精神上之維　，如能在農村中或鄉鎮設立合作軋花廠，則農民對於合作之關係必較為密切，信仰較深，且軋花廠亦可作為收集棉花之所，代替壓榨所之位置，軋成皮棉後即檢取樣品，再行打包，運往堆棧，以免將來抽樣之煩。</p>
<p>（三）美國棉產交易社American　Cotton　Growers　Exchange</p>
<p>各州棉花運銷合作社成立後，尙無一聯合之組織以劃一運銷制度，並輔助各社運銷之業務。特克薩斯與奧克拉荷馬合作社乃首先創　此種組織，於一九二一年開成立大會，定名為美國棉產交易社，其時加入者共有十二州合作社，茲述其概況如下：</p>
<p>（甲）原則與組織　此交易社亦如各州合作社為無股金不分紅利之組織，既無會章，又無附約，僅依社會加入時所簽定之合同維持其交易。社中共設十二部：（一）行政與執行部，（二）管理部，（三）分類與標準部，（四）貸棧部，（五）保險部，（六）運輸部，（七）金融部，（八）統計部，（九）普通棉推銷部，（十）細絨棉推銷部，（十一）法律部，（十二）實地服務部。總所設田尼孫州之孟菲斯城（Mempbis）。</p>
<p>（乙）管理　交易社之上設有董事會，由各持合作社選派三人合組之，每年改選一次，另由政府派公家董事三人，保護公家利益。董事會每年開會二次或三次，由董事長召集之，依合同上之規定，決定營業政策。此外並有執行委員會，由各社派一代表合組之。每月開會一次，負責進行一切事務。社中設主席一人，副主席一人，文書會計各一人。</p>
<p>（丙）業務　交易社擔任之業務，約可分為四大類：</p>
<p>（子）銷售　各州合作社感銷路不廣，或有數額過鉅無力推銷者，皆可以委託交易社代售。該社在國內外各大棉花市場均設有代理人，時時報告商情，並代表該社接洽交易，各州合作社藉此可以省銷售之勞。</p>
<p>（　）調劑金融—交易社能利用其　厚之勢力，向各大銀行接洽借欵，以謀解除各州合作社金融上之困難，惟借欵成立時，仍需由各州合作社直接與貸欵者訂立契約，交易社僅處於媒介之地位而已。</p>
<p>（寅）實地服務—交易社之服務部，專司調查各州合作社之經營方法，截長補短，廣為推行，使各社能漸次採用一律之完善方法，此外並協助各州合作社之服務部，發展其社務。</p>
<p>（卯）統計—此為交易社最受各分社重視之工作，即搜集市塲中棉運之數字，如供給量消費量，棉價長期趨勢，棉價節季變動等，加以分析，報告於各州棉花運銷合作社，各州合作社即可預測市場中之供求關係，而決其銷售政策。</p>
<p>（丁）經營方法　凡依純正之合作原則組織之各州合作社，皆可向交易社報名，經執行委員會通過後即可與社中簽定合同，推定代表三人為董事，一人為執行委員，手續即告完畢。以後如有棉花可委託交易社代售，並得享受其他權利。交易社之費用甚少，所有運銷費用，係按各社交運之棉花包數分攤再徵取少量佣金，供社中開支之用。</p>
<p>以上僅將美國棉花運銷合作制度作一簡略之描繪，至於其優點與缺點，以限於篇幅，不克申述，容他日為文補記之。</p>

<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>美國最近發見一種學堂病，據說它是學堂的特產。患者都是一些小學生，時常呈現出憤怒，不安，焦急和高度的情感狀態等等特徵；而且胃部很弱，睡眠不安，晚上常做恐怖的夢。那種症象在開學之後就顯現着，在學期的進行中愈見惡劣。腦力的測騐和運動競賽促進着它的成長。</p>
<p>這種神經病的起因是由於對於多少地神經質的孩子的壓制。許多學校制度要孩子們能以同一的速度讀完同一的學科，不然「附註」裏便得填着「丁等，」「愚笨」「遲鈍」或者「劣等」之類字眼。比較地神經質的孩子有一二門學科不能跟着同級的一齊前進，在老師的激勵之下努力着：結果就充滿了愁苦的疾病。</p>
<p>一班衛生專家正在注意着這個已診明的病。有的主張往後成績報告單上只寫「滿意」或者「不滿意。」有的卻以為學堂應該根本剷除「壓制」那個惡魔。</p>
<p>看到這個消息，我着實替美國的小朋友們歡喜，祗希望那些專家不久就擬出具體的預防辦法。跟着，我當然要連想起自己的這麼多的小弟弟，小妹妹來了！他們悄悄地生長着，沒有引起任何注意和興趣。所以功課不好，他們儘可以被命令站壁角，關夜學，寄膳寄宿的不給飯吃，「被笨胚」「呆大」地爛罵。到學期終了，報告單上寫上一個「劣等，」老師們便算盡了責任。而做父兄的在接到單子之後，免不了大怒：一面心痛着化了錢沒有收穫，一面「養不教，父之過」地開始虐待他們的子弟，減縮子弟的物質的享受，希望孩子自覺？</p>
<p>假使中國的孩子們中間有好多也患着學堂病，有誰會發現這個，注意這個呢？啊，救救孩子！</p>
<h3 id="c194">A字牛奶 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>某大學裏有一位女生，曾一度被捧為皇后，那時，一般同學，給伊起了一個混名，呌做A字牛奶。</p>
<p>據說A字牛奶的混名，也有些兒小掌故的，原因是那一位女生的老太爺，是以牧牛起家的。家，是在南國的某殖民地。在那裏，豢養着二百條乳牛。A字牛奶，自幼就喝着自產的牛乳，十餘年來，未曾中　過，所以那一種健而美的體格，正像牛奶棚中的A字牛奶那麼的合乎標準。所以名之曰A字牛奶，果然是再也確切不過。</p>
<p>A字牛奶在那大學裏書念時，也定飲着一磅A字牛奶，據說因喝了十餘年，所以非喝不可了。但是伊的飲牛奶，據說是不用自己掏腰包的，就是牛奶之外的一切　費，也都由一位同學歐陽先生　　　的。所以　　的歐陽先生，便有了牛奶棚老　的　號。歐陽先生，同時也以牛奶棚老闆自居。對於A字牛奶，絕對不許他人染指。</p>
<p>在大學裏讀了二年之後，牛奶棚老闆　了沸點，有情人終成眷屬，終於正式結婚了。於是Ａ字牛奶便輟學而跟着老闆，回南去度着甜蜜的生活。</p>
<p>這是前年暑假中的故事。此後一年中，A字牛奶的消息沉沉，幾乎都給一般同學遺忘了。可是在去年秋季裏，在別一個大學中，忽然又發現了Ａ字牛奶的踪跡。銷聲匿跡，已不復有昔日的風頭了。起初大家還不知這便是某大學的Ａ字牛奶，但二三月後，終於給人揭穿了秘密。據消息靈通者說，A字牛奶和老闆，結婚之後才半年，便反目離婚了，所以現在的A字牛奶，又已恢復了小姐的資格了。</p>
<p>但是Ａ字牛奶，自經創傷之後，屏棄了一切享樂生活，埋頭苦讀，不交男朋友，竟是一位再也用功不過的好學生。於是一輩促狹的舊同學，把伊的混名，改成了B字牛奶，說的已沒有昔日那麼的夠人迷戀了。</p>

<p>可是這話說回來了，這件事除非自己完全退讓了，不然總要找一個正當解決的法子的。那除了起訴，還有什麽？正是這樣的想着，既要起訴，就也不必怕得罪他們。卻聽到樓上哈哈的笑着，有女人說話聲，那女人可不就是專員夫人嗎？笑道：假使這裏官司打輸了，上高等法院，高等法院再輸了，上南京最高法院，到了南京最高法院，就算輸了，也是一年以後的事。你是個閑人，還有什麽怕和他糾纏得的。這一年裏頭，你得吃喝穿，全不用愁，有我們大家幫你的忙。那聲音傳到樓下來，還是這樣清清楚楚，說話的人，似乎有幾分故意如此的。賈多才回到屋子裏，點了一根煙捲，斜躺在床上插着兩隻腿架在板凳上，只管想着需要什麽手腕來對付他們。他忽然自言自語的道：什麽風浪也見過了，難道受他們的恐嚇嗎？於是跳了起來，就把桌上現成的紙墨筆硯，起草了一張稿子，寫的是：編輯先生大鑒：弟為個人人格計，決定聘請律師，正式起訴，關於鄙人記載，請根據此點着筆，不必顧慮也。即頌撰祺，賈多才頓首。把信寫好了，便向門外看看，有茶房沒有。預　呌茶房把信送了去。這就看到茶房引了兩個人，向隔壁屋子裏走去。其中有個大胖子，穿了長而且大的藍湖　夾袍子，口裏　着大半截雪茄，手上把一頂草帽同一支手杖，一同拿着，頗有點東方資本家的丰度。茶房替他開門，送他進去，卻聽到他帶一種發牢騷的口吻道：那個說西安人不會做買賣？比我們東方人做買賣，還要高叨得多呢。隨着有個本地人答道：我們還不老實嗎？我們要是調皮的人，就把這地皮再留幾個月，等火車通了再賣，不更要多賣一些　　　賈多才對於這種言語，是最聽得進耳的，更縮到屋子裏坐着，側了臉，聽了下去。（八九三）</p>

<p>粥店是代價最廉的果腹地，有了十幾枚銅子進去，就可吃得挺着肚皮出來。</p>
<p>上海因為窮富雜居，人口眾多的關係，大小粥店開設得觸目皆是。他們除廢歷年首停業三天外，平時無論狂風暴雨，總是日夜營業。始終不上排門、現此許多　　　，都視粥店為一處不費旅資的寄踪之所。每至夜半更深路無行人時如走進去作成幾碗薄粥，就可歇一下腳。在這嚴寒冬天，倘與堂倌相熟的話，向他打了一個招呼，便可伏案面臥，暫作臨時公館。如此看來，粥店開放門戶主義，無疑一個庇護貧民的善團。我希望上海的商人，多開小粥店。少設大旅館，俾無家可歸的流浪人，多一個夜間棲止的場合。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c215">救亡運動中對戲劇家的要求 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>由於華北形勢之危急，從「五四運動的故鄕」底文化城——北平傳出了救亡運動的呼聲之後，立刻就得到了各地民衆底强烈的響應，上海的巿民很快的就組織了救國的團體，從文化界，婦女，小學敎員，護士，……到各種職業界的人，都起來參加了這决救國的行動，很悲壯的表現着目前中國的民氣還沒有銷沉，而且，也是永遠不會銷沉的。中國人，除掉漢奸，賣國賊以外，沒有一個願意做亡國奴，眼看着國土無論是直接或間接（變相）的淪喪！，因此，卽管目前在「隣睦邦交」及種種困難之下，民衆救亡運動的情緒依舊是一天一天的高漲，比之九一八以來的任何時期都要激昂！</p>
<p>在這種急迫的情勢之中，在高漲的救亡的呼聲裏，素來站在時代前錄的文化界，是應該更站到大衆的前頭，擔負起救亡運動的任務來的。然而，就着目前的情形看來，文化界的人顯然還不曾盡了他們的責任的。誠如上海文化界救國會的宣言所說：「……全國各級敎師們，還未站在學生的前面，負起領導學生救亡的責任；從事新聞事業的人們，還在新聞檢查制度下，隱匿現實，顚倒是非，沒有站在大衆前，負起輿論的領導，雜誌編輯及作家門，尙未做到盡自己的良心，用自己的筆代表大衆說話，並指導大衆的行動；共它如出版，戲劇，電影等部門的工作者，也未能盡自己領域內應盡的天職。這不能不說是我們的恥辱。」眞的，我們的文化人應該立刻要洗去了這些恥辱，馬上把我門底緊急的任務擔負起來。因之，在這裏，我應該提到戲劇的部門，以及從事於戲劇活動的戲劇家。</p>
<p>去年的戲劇的活動非常活躍，因之，去年也就無愧乎它是「戲劇年」。就今年年頭的情景看來，今年的戲劇活動大致上也不會比去年低落，然而，今年是個危機的年頭，戲劇的公演就非捉住當前底緊急的情勢不可。去年年底，我在「談言」曾經說過！「假如我們不願亡國，不願做亡國奴，那末，戲劇在目前可說是我們作為民族獨立解放運動底有力的武器！」但是，目前的戲劇家們却還不曾積極地把這有力的，武器運用起來，這更不能不說是我們的恥辱從報紙上我們隱約聽到北平學生有下鄕宣傳的消息，並有人因陋就簡的演出了一些反帝的戲劇，學生們並非以戲劇為職業的，然而却能捉住當前的局勢去做戲，反之，反觀以戲劇為職業的上海戲劇家們，却還沒有積極地活勁起來，甚至有些人還演一些無關重要的戲，這眞使我們，感到莫大的悲哀！感到了無限的慚愧！……</p>
<p>九一八以後，反帝的戲劇曾有過一時期很活躍，目前的形勢比九一八更危急得多，然而戲劇家們為什麽反而沉寂起來呢？為了救我們的國家，救我們的民族，要使中國的大衆做自己底國家的主人；我們要求戲劇家們一致集合起來，在救亡運動的聯合戰綫之中，不論是什麽形式的戲，不論是什麽派別，……都應該一致演出反帝救亡的戲劇，使中國的大衆在舞臺上看到我們民族的怒吼，激奮起救國的熱情，以至推動整個救亡運動的開展。——在舞臺上，讓我們喊：「怒吼吧，中國！」</p>

However, with the nation in such dire straits, I felt uneasy staying abroad for so long, and thus hastily returned. My advocacy remains the same as before: the Party must be restored as a party with principles and spirit, eliminating the disarray and errors of the past; the government should be transformed into a responsible and capable government, correcting the past mistakes of timidity and complacency, in order to shoulder the heavy responsibility of resolving the national crisis and building the nation. Only in this way can we be accountable to the people." At 4:00 PM, he attended a welcoming reception held by the gentry and business community at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. Security along the way was extremely tight, with no entry or exit allowed without a pass. Even the cameras of news reporters were inspected. Hu delivered a speech, saying, "For several years, I have been plagued by illness and have not been able to contribute my strength to the country, which I deeply regret.

When reporters approached Mr. Hu upon his landing to inquire about his travels in Europe, he presented a written statement, the original text of which is as follows: "I have been away from my motherland for over six months. The purpose of this departure was solely to recuperate. However, my health has still not fully recovered in these six months. Given the nation's current plight, I felt uneasy staying abroad for so long, and thus hastily returned eastward. My political views and policies remain the same as before, which are difficult to fully express. In short, the Party should be restored as a party with principles and spirit, eliminating the errors of disintegration and disarray in the past, and striving to continue the great cause left unfinished by the Party. The government should be transformed into a responsible and capable government, correcting the past mistakes of timidity and complacency, in order to bear the heavy responsibility of resolving the national crisis and building the nation. My attitude toward the domestic reality is based on the above two points. Only in this way can we be accountable to the people and to the late Premier and ourselves. I have been out of the country for half a year, and I regret that I have not been able to do more for the country. However, I have gained many impressions wherever I have traveled, which can serve as a lesson for us. I will share them at a later date when I have some free time." (Nineteenth Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Zhi Zheyuan has also not sent a telegram to Nanjing regarding this matter. It is impossible to speculate what the situation is. It is found that De was originally a member of the Mongolian Political Council and also the secretary-general. The title of the chairman of the Mongolian Political Council is held by Yun Duanwangzhabu, but Yun is old and cannot bear the burden, so it is actually presided over by De. De originally worked in the Bailingmiao council office. Recently, because of the Pangjiang meeting, he went to Pangjiang and is still in the Pangjiang meeting, while Yun is in Zhangbei. Even if the declaration of independence is true, it is only his personal action and should be regarded as unrelated to the Mongolian Political Council and the entire Inner Mongolia, because if he leaves the Mongolian Political Council, he cannot actually govern the Mongolian banners.

<p>Seeking Sino-Japanese "Manchukuo" Cooperation: Suma Returns with New Instructions</p>
<p>Nanjing: The international situation after the breakdown of the disarmament conference seems superficially calm, but future trade relations may inevitably deteriorate considerably. Therefore, Foreign Minister Hirota is seeking to prevent any shaking of the foundation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo, and is focusing on the realization of East Asian policy. Ambassador Yoshizawa has instructed Suma, the Consul General in Nanjing, to return to Japan in early February. In mid-February, Ambassador Arita will go to China to succeed him. Taking this opportunity, the diplomatic organs in China will be refreshed, and the following new policies will be pursued to increase the mutual welfare of the Chinese and Japanese people and move towards a long-term plan: 1. If Sino-Japanese relations reach a state of possible cooperation, provide all assistance for China's independence and prosperity. 2. The fundamental reason for the Chinese people's self-reliance lies in the cultivation of the people's strength. Therefore, it is necessary to stabilize politics. 3. To prevent disasters, water conservancy projects should be prioritized. Therefore, major companies such as the South Manchuria Railway will be used as intermediaries to establish Sino-Japanese joint ventures, respecting the existing rights and interests of foreign countries to prevent the deterioration of international relations.

<p>Nanjing: The government believes that the most strategically appropriate time to dissolve parliament is after the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister have delivered speeches outlining their policy directions. It is now devising various plans to strike decisively. At the same time, it believes that the reasons for the dissolution must be made known to the people as a whole. Therefore, it plans to issue a statement regarding the dissolution of parliament in the form of a conversation by Prime Minister Okada after the dissolution. The original draft is currently being carefully prepared by Chief Secretary Shirane. The gist of its content is roughly as follows: Under the current domestic and international situation, the government has consistently acted in the spirit of national unity. However, the current political situation cannot be expected to lead to satisfactory progress in national affairs. Therefore, the government has respectfully requested an imperial edict to dissolve the House of Representatives and inform the people.

<p>Nanjing: The 68th session of parliament, fraught with the possibility of dissolution, will reconvene on the 21st. Various political parties have decided to convene party congresses on the 20th beforehand to prepare for the upcoming dissolution. It has been decided that political parties will submit an all-encompassing vote of no confidence to confront the government head-on. The Seiyukai will convene a congress at its headquarters at 2:00 PM on the 20th, with a high spirit of not fearing dissolution and aligning its steps. The government and the party have always advocated dissolution. The Minseito will also convene a congress at Seiyoken in Ueno at 1:00 PM on the same day. The Kokumin Domei will also hold a meeting on this day. These gatherings are largely demonstrations for general elections after dissolution, so the procedures for the general election have already been prepared, and the situation is quite tense.

The debate was chaotic and inconclusive. It recessed at 6:00 PM and reconvened at 9:00 PM, but the dispute continued. General Affairs Director Kuhara then proposed that the general affairs meeting on the 19th discuss the issue, and the meeting adjourned at 12:20 AM. However, the general trend of the party is largely inclined to submit an all-encompassing vote of no confidence including the clarification of national principles at the beginning of parliament.

<p>Tokyo: Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to deliver a speech outlining diplomatic policy at the beginning of the reconvened parliament. The key points are recorded below: 1. The Japanese government believes that maintaining and ensuring free trade policies is the most effective way to promote world peace. It has always taken the lead and consistently followed the principles of free trade. The entire territory of Japan has historically allowed the free flow of people and goods from all countries around the world, and this remains the case today. 2. However, looking directly at the current world situation, on the one hand, inexpensive and high-quality Japanese goods are blocked by unfair tariff barriers in various countries. On the other hand, the overseas advancement of the Japanese people is also effectively prohibited worldwide. 3. The Japanese government believes that such trade measures are the greatest fundamental obstacle to maintaining world peace. It should demand from the world the indispensable conditions for national survival, namely, the free flow of people and goods, and request the opening of world markets and resources. All countries should guarantee Japan's peaceful progress in the world. (19th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Fage Speaks on the Position Regarding the Naval Disarmament Conference; Failure of the Five-Power Conference Due to Political Issues; Japanese Delegation to Return Home Via the United States <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Naval Minister Pietri recently gave an interview to Le Petit Parisien regarding the situation at the naval conference, stating that the failure of the five-nation conference was due to political issues interfering. He said, "Each country has the right to determine what naval forces are needed to maintain its own security. However, six months before the implementation of the annual shipbuilding program, other countries should be notified with necessary and clear information. If this is the case, the situation of naval issues can be clearly understood. After the naval conference is over, we can leave London without fear of repeating the absurd dangers of naval competition. All naval powers either secretly build ships or suddenly build ships, which are nothing more than the steps of such competition. When the naval conference reconvened at the beginning of this month, our delegation proposed the above suggestions, and the delegations of other countries praised them in unison. At that time, I felt that Japan could also agree. However, the Japanese delegation insisted that the naval conference must make a decision on the joint maximum amount proposed by that country, which led to the failure of the matter. If the Japanese did not know that the joint maximum amount could cause the failure of the naval conference, why did they still propose this proposal? It must be due to political reasons, which France wanted to avoid. France knew that quantitative restrictions were not the only issue that should be discussed at the naval conference, nor were they the only important issue, but it still insisted on discussing this first. As for the humanization of submarine warfare, France has the strongest submarine force among all countries, so it has a direct interest in it. However, we should be clear that submarine warfare should still be controlled by military purposes. Moreover, compared with its national defense needs, France's battleship tonnage is still insufficient. In fact, France's protected interests are all over the world, its coastline is very long, and its distance from various colonies is also far, so it must maintain a considerable naval force."

<h3 id="e43">The Neglected Issue of Inner Mongolia <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Recent domestic and foreign telegrams have reported serious incidents occurring between Bangjiang and Jining (Pingdiquan). Although the specific facts are difficult to ascertain, at a time when the nation is focused on the negotiations in eastern Hebei and northern Chahar, such warnings from Inner Mongolia cannot help but cause us great anxiety, given the past activities of ambitious nations in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Our anxiety stems from two points: 1. The so-called Inner Mongolia is a territory of China, and from east to west, it has close relations with nine provinces, including Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Jehol, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia. Today, apart from Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Jehol, the other six provinces are potentially affected by and involved in this incident. 2. Among the six leagues of Inner Mongolia, the Jerim League, the Horchin League, and the Josutu League were reorganized by a powerful neighbor after the September 18th Incident and split into the four Xing'an provinces. The current issue is that the powerful neighbor is further expanding, causing unrest in the Xilingol League, Ulanqab League, and Yekhe Joo League from Chahar and Suiyuan to Gansu and Ningxia.</p>
<p>Based on the first point, the impact of this incident will extend China's external troubles from the Northeast to the Northwest, from the Changbai Mountains to the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Based on the second point, the powerful neighbor created a Northeast puppet organization through the September 18th Incident and used the three leagues of Inner Mongolia within it as a foundation for invading all of Inner Mongolia. The step-by-step progress is clear. If our country does not take appropriate measures to resolve this incident, its extension to the Northwest will be inevitable.</p>
<p>Although the above situation refers to the entire Inner Mongolia issue, it may not be realized in the short term. What is currently an urgent concern for our country is the coercion of Suiyuan and Shanxi provinces. The North China issue in the minds of the powerful neighboring warlords and ronin actually includes the five provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi. Because the authorities of Shanxi and Suiyuan were not tempted, their plans suffered a major setback. As a result, they became angry and dispatched a partial force, ordering Li Shou-hsin to join forces with the Mongol Security Forces to bypass Chahar and approach Bangjiang, threatening the Mongol princes and jointly attacking Jining, remotely controlling Datong. This situation is clear when viewing a map. Therefore, this incident has two roles in terms of its initiation and direction. Fundamentally, it is a step towards enticing all of Inner Mongolia. As a side effect, it is used to solve the so-called North China issue.</p>
<p>In the progress of the situation, we hope that the central government and the Suiyuan authorities will recognize the seriousness of the nature of the incident and deal with it decisively. The policies towards Mongolia since June 1933 are purely domestic affairs and still apply to the enlightened Mongolian leagues, while those who have joined forces with the Li Shou-hsin puppet army must be warned. It is rumored that the Suiyuan army has prepared to prevent the westward expansion of the puppet army. It is hoped that the central government will have a comprehensive plan so that the defenders have something to follow. If Suiyuan is not made a continuation of eastern Chahar, and Shanxi and Suiyuan are used as a barrier to the safety of the Northwest, it can be said that there is some hope. Otherwise, with past lessons in mind, how can the spread of disaster be stopped?</p>

<p>Rome: Turkish, Iranian, Iraqi, and Afghan officials have recently established a non-aggression pact. Italian political figures commented that this is an important factor in international affairs and its impact will be very significant. Britain, in its Near East policy, must take this into account. Because after the establishment of this political group, it will unite 35 million people into one force. This move will undoubtedly cause serious problems for the interests of the British Empire.

<p>Geneva: The regular session of the League of Nations Council is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 11:00 AM tomorrow. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will arrive here at 10:20 PM today from Clermont-Ferrand in central France. Most other Council member representatives, including British Foreign Secretary Eden, will arrive tomorrow. League of Nations officials are very concerned about the illness of King George V of England and the potential for a cabinet crisis in France, as they believe that Eden and Laval may not be able to stay in Geneva for long according to their original plans. (19th Havas)</p>
<p>Geneva: When the League of Nations Council meets tomorrow, it will only deal with Ethiopia's request to send personnel to investigate Italian aircraft bombing hospitals, undefended cities, and civilians, and the use of poison gas. Ethiopia's request may be passed, but Italy will also request an investigation into the Ethiopian army's use of dumdum bullets, dismemberment of prisoners, and abuse of the Red Cross. Sanctions issues and the implementation of an oil embargo are matters to be considered by the Committee of Eighteen. The general opinion is that the implementation of an oil embargo will depend on Britain's attitude. If Britain is unwilling to initiate it, no one will advocate it. Many people in Geneva believe that Italy is gradually approaching its doom. If an oil embargo is passed and pushed too far, it may create a dangerous situation, which is not politically appropriate. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>Geneva: According to our correspondent, if there is any misfortune for King George V of England, the current session of the League of Nations Council will have to be postponed for one or two days before it can be held (originally scheduled for the 20th of this month). As for the dispute between the Soviet Union and Uruguay and the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, because British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval will be staying here for a very short time, they should be dealt with quickly. Regarding the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, since the breakdown of the reconciliation plan proposed by former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval in December last year, there has been no change in the diplomatic situation. When the Committee of Thirteen of the Council meets in the future, it will only reiterate its willingness to proceed with reconciliation as soon as possible. As for Committee of Eighteen Chairman Vasconcelos, he will also convene the committee to meet, at which time he may appoint a sub-committee to study the possibility of implementing an oil embargo against Italy and to discuss the political, legal, and practical aspects of this issue. The Committee of Eighteen itself will have to wait until February or March to make a decision, because the attitude of the US Congress towards the new Neutrality Act will not be clear until then. (19th Havas)</p>
<p>Paris: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval took the train to Clermont-Ferrand in central France at 5:00 PM to stay for a short time before going to Geneva to attend the League of Nations Council meeting. Before leaving, the Prime Minister declared to the press, "I will go to Geneva tomorrow to hold consultations with representatives of other countries, including British representative Eden. This conversation should be helpful to the situation, but my stay will be very short."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister did not mention a word about the domestic political situation. (18th Havas)</p>
<p>Rome: For the League of Nations Council meeting on the 20th of this month, the Italian government has sent Aloisi, the director of the Prime Minister's Office, as its representative. According to semi-official observations, the attitude of the countries currently participating in sanctions towards intensifying sanctions has shown a tendency to ease. Aloisi's attendance at the Council meeting is a very important stage for this fact. It is reported that Aloisi's acceptance of this mission was decided after careful consideration by the Italian government. After the Council meeting, Aloisi will once again defend Italy's views on the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and will hold talks with representatives of various countries outside the meeting, hoping to make the sanctions more moderate. This is the method that the Italian government has decided on. In addition, the Italian government recently sent a note to the League of Nations protesting against the "various barbaric acts of Ethiopia," in order to demonstrate that Ethiopia does not have the qualifications of a civilized country. The Italian side hopes that this note will have an effect. (18th Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Rome Issues Statement: Willing to Maintain European Peace; Colony Policy Not Abandoned <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Roman government today issued a statement in a particularly accommodating tone, stating that Italy's reason for not withdrawing from the League of Nations is to comply with the principles of collective security and maintain peace in Europe, and it is eager to continue to contribute its cooperation for peace. As for the plan to conquer East Africa, it is an absolutely necessary move, because Italian territories there are often harmed. This is entirely a colonial issue. As long as the security of the territory is consolidated, Italy will devote all its efforts to promoting the European peace plan. It is rumored that the League of Nations will be more lenient towards Italy. This statement coincides with this rumor. (18th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Problem of Soviet-Uruguayan Break in Relations</p>
<p>Geneva: With a French cabinet crisis about to break out and King George V of England in poor health, French Prime Minister Laval and British Foreign Secretary Eden will not stay here for more than two days to participate in the League of Nations Council meeting. At the Council meeting on the 20th, various major political issues will be discussed quickly, such as the complaint filed by the Soviet Union after Uruguay severed relations. According to our interviewer, the League of Nations Secretariat and the countries concerned have been in contact in recent days, so it will not cause major difficulties. The Council will listen to the statements of the representatives of the Soviet Union and Uruguay, and then entrust three member countries to draft a resolution in order to bring it to a swift conclusion. In general, the Council will recognize that it has no right to judge whether the Soviet complaint is appropriate and will advise the Soviet Union and Uruguay to maintain friendly relations in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. (18th Havas)</p>
<p>Geneva: After Uruguay and the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations, the Soviet government protested to the League of Nations. The next regular meeting of the Council will be discussed at the beginning of next week. At that time, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and Uruguayan representative Dr. Guani will both attend and make statements. It is expected that the Council will appoint a committee of three countries to draft a resolution acceptable to the countries involved. This dispute is expected to be resolved satisfactorily before the Council adjourns. (19th Havas)</p>
<p>Danzig Administrative Report</p>
<p>Warsaw: League of Nations High Commissioner for the Free City of Danzig, Lester, recently submitted a report to the League of Nations, stating that, from his observation, the Danzig Municipal Council is obviously worrying. The Free City's constitution is guaranteed by the League of Nations, but the City Council constantly violates certain provisions of the constitution. An international committee should be established to investigate these unconstitutional facts and find ways to prevent them from happening again. The powers of the High Commissioner should also be expanded. Even the last City Council election was based on unconstitutional actions. The police have no political function and do not maintain public security, so the results are difficult to be fair. (According to the results of the election, the Nazi Party won 43 seats and the opposition party won 29 seats.) In addition, Danzig Nazi Party leader Forster forcibly ordered his armed party members to swear allegiance to German leader Hitler, which is also reprehensible. However, the relationship between Poland and Danzig is generally satisfactory. (18th Havas)</p>

<p>Following the decision of Minister Without Portfolio Herriot to resign, the Laval cabinet's position has already been affected, and a major cabinet crisis is expected to erupt in the middle of next week. Herriot met with Prime Minister Laval this afternoon, saying that he would formally resign after the Prime Minister returned from Geneva, likely on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the Executive Committee of the Radical Socialist Party is scheduled to meet tomorrow. If the committee decides that all cabinet members affiliated with the party should also resign, then those cabinet members will retire at the same time as Herriot, also likely next week. The cabinet members met today, with Herriot attending, and reaffirmed their decision to resign from their cabinet positions and not to nominate a candidate for party leader. People here are calm about the political situation, but there is intense criticism of Herriot's decision, with some harsh rebukes, echoing the tone of the right-wing parties. These parties, who support the current cabinet, all say that if a cabinet crisis breaks out, the financial sector will inevitably panic. Regarding this, the Governor of the Bank of France, Tannery, warned Herriot. However, the stock market situation remains stable as usual. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: The position of leader of the Radical Socialist Party has been vacant since Minister Without Portfolio Herriot resigned in December last year. The party's Executive Committee held an election at 3:00 PM today, and left-wing leader and former Prime Minister Daladier was elected amidst cheers. Daladier is strongly opposed to the Laval cabinet. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>Innsbruck: Contrary to widespread rumors of serious unrest in South Tyrol province, which the authorities strongly deny, a special correspondent from Reuters today visited the area to investigate. After crossing the Brenner Pass border with barbed wire obstacles, they noticed secret police following them. Italy has transformed South Tyrol province into a large military camp, with at least 20,000 troops stationed there. The machine gun teams stationed on the mountains were practicing with straw figures of Abyssinians when the correspondent arrived. Every Tyrolean encountered opposes the Italian war. The Italian authorities seem capable of handling the current situation without doubt, but the morale of the troops is even more important. South Tyrol province is now feeling the impact of sanctions. It is reported that some new recruits cried upon hearing that they were being transferred to Africa. The soldiers lack martial spirit, and their daily allowance is less than two shillings. The correspondent learned that about 1,400 people have fled Tyrol into Austria and Bavaria. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>

At the same time, the Italian government has responded to Sweden's protest against the Italian air raid, resolutely rejecting the claim of intentionally harming the Swedish relief team.

<h3 id="e54">British King's Condition Not Improving: Cardiologist Leaving Palace Raises Speculation, People Anxious, Prayers Held in Churches Nationwide <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The latest bulletin reporting on the King's condition is quite serious in nature, causing increasing anxiety throughout the British Empire. Prayers were held in churches nationwide over the past two days. According to official sources from Sandringham this morning, the King's sleep was restless, but his strength remained. A bulletin will be issued tonight. The Archbishop of Canterbury said in the cathedral that the King's strength was still good, and that the royal doctors were skilled, so there was hope for recovery. The renowned cardiologist, Sir Maurice Cassidy, who was consulted by the three royal physicians, left Sandringham yesterday afternoon, raising speculation. The King's two granddaughters also returned to London yesterday. The King's daughter, who came to Sandringham yesterday, inquired in detail about her father's condition from her mother and siblings after entering the palace. The King's third son, the Duke of Gloucester, was unable to attend to his bedside due to a sore throat, but it is said that his throat pain is now gradually improving. The King's two nurses are constantly at his side. Since dawn today, many people have gathered in front of Buckingham Palace to inquire about the King's condition, showing the nation's deep concern. Despite the cold, men, women, and children are waiting in groups for the release of bulletins. Hundreds of news reporters from around the world have gathered in the town of Dowsinhham to gather news nearby. The lights in the King's bedroom remained on all night, and the nurses quietly moved about, watching the King's movements. The lights were only turned off after dawn. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>King George V, currently suffering from tracheobronchitis, is convalescing at Sandringham House. According to a bulletin issued by the royal physicians at 10:00 PM tonight, his condition has not changed. This shows that since the afternoon bulletin, the King's condition has neither worsened nor improved. A subsequent midnight bulletin stated: "His Majesty is now resting peacefully." The citizens of London were shocked upon hearing the news of the King's illness. This afternoon, people from all walks of life gathered in front of Buckingham Palace, waiting to see the bulletins released by the attending physicians. When the evening newspapers were published, people on the streets rushed to buy them, eager to be the first to see the news. The people's anxiety is evident. It is rumored that the granddaughters of the King, Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret (daughters of the King's second son, the Duke of York, who have been at the palace since Christmas), have returned to London from Sandringham House, adding to the uneasiness. The Archbishop of Canterbury led a sincere prayer this afternoon at Canterbury Cathedral. Other Catholic churches in the southern diocese were also ordered to hold prayers, wishing the King a speedy recovery. This is another reason for the people's anxiety. Prime Minister Baldwin, who had intended to go to Chequers for the weekend, has canceled his trip due to the King's illness. It is learned that the royal physicians, Lord Dawson, Sir William Shearer, and Sir Hugh Whitwell, are all attending to his bedside. Sir Hugh Whitwell has been a royal physician for over 20 years. The renowned cardiologist, Sir Maurice Cassidy, is still at Sandringham House after being summoned from Harley Street this morning. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Baldwin has canceled his customary weekend outing to remain on Downing Street. It is understood that this move is due to the dangerous condition of King George. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Simon receives hourly reports on the condition, as it is the Home Secretary's duty to personally announce the King's death. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>The bulletin from Sandringham Palace at 3:30 PM today stated that King George had a few hours of peaceful sleep, but his heart was very weak and his pulse was even weaker. Princess Elizabeth and Princess Rose have returned to the palace from London. The King's secretary, Sir William, has also arrived here. The general public attaches great importance to their arrival. However, Home Secretary Simon is still at his private residence. It is understood that the government may organize a Council of State to govern during the King's illness. Meanwhile, the King's Lynn Hospital, ten miles from Sandringham Palace, has prepared a large supply of oxygen in case of emergency. (National Telegraph dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales and the Duke of York, sons of the King, arrived at Sandringham House in England this morning by car, traveling from London. They will return here tonight. It is generally believed that the Prince of Wales will meet with Prime Minister Baldwin. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>England, Newham: This agency's special correspondent reports that this town, which is a stone's throw from Sandringham House, has become a gathering place for news hunters since news of King's illness broke out. The situation today is noteworthy. More than 50 journalists and photographers arrived here early in the morning. All the hotels are crowded. In addition to providing proper hospitality, the proprietors are well aware that these uninvited guests may not go to bed at night and will be sitting up all night waiting for news from Sandringham House, so they have specially set up tables and chairs for them to write. However, the palace gates are heavily guarded, and reporters are not allowed to enter. They all stand in front of the palace gate, illuminated by the palace lights, imagining the tense situation inside. Seeing the King's flag flying in the wind on the roof, one can imagine that the King is safe. It was learned this afternoon that cardiologist Sir Maurice Cassidy has left the palace and does not intend to return, which caused a great shock. People speculated that perhaps Sir Maurice Cassidy was also powerless. However, palace officials said that Sir Maurice's departure should not be taken too seriously. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Trip to Nanchang (Part Two): Inauguration of the Yunan Section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and Other Matters <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Grand Inauguration Ceremony: On January 15th, at approximately 7:00 AM, the inauguration ceremony reception office notified guests at various hotels that vehicles were prepared to transport them to Nanchang Station to attend the ceremony. At 9:00 AM, guests successively boarded buses to the assembly area in front of the station. This was a shed made of reeds, large enough to accommodate a thousand people, decorated with lanterns and colorful ribbons. On the stage, in addition to the national flag and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, there was a loudspeaker for the speakers to amplify their voices. A horizontal banner read "Yunan Section Inauguration Ceremony". On both sides were long couplets that read, "Six hundred *li* of winding tracks, travelers rejoice, celebrating the connection between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces," and "Hundreds of people united with sincerity, the project completed successfully, working together to serve the nation." More than six hundred people attended, including the Director-General of the railway, Zeng Yangfu; the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Shaohong; the Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Xiong Shihui; representatives from industry, banking, and the press; and guests from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and other places. Director-General Zeng Yangfu presided over the meeting and delivered a report. Following this, the Director and Chief Engineer of the Railway Bureau, Du Zhenyuan, and the Deputy Director and Deputy Chief Engineer, Hou Jiashen, reported on the construction process. Because more than two thousand people died during the construction of this section of the railway – some killed by bandits, some drowned, and some succumbed to epidemics – Zeng Yangfu asked the guests in attendance to stand in silence for five minutes to mourn the deceased workers. Subsequently, Huang Shaohong, Xiong Shihui, representatives from the Provincial Party Headquarters, the German Embassy's Representative, Fischer, and representatives from the Sinot-Wahalf Company delivered speeches. The representative of the banking group, Cui Baoshu, also read speeches written by T.V. Soong and Song Hanzhang. Afterwards, ushers guided the attendees out of the assembly area for a photograph in front of the station. Then everyone boarded the special train from Hangzhou to Nanchang. At 12:20 PM, the train departed for Liangjiadu to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the Nanping section.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Nanping Section: According to the Railway Bureau's survey, the Nanping section will begin at a place called Hexi on a tributary of the Fu River and end at Pingxiang, with a length of 263 kilometers. This is more than 20 kilometers shorter than the northern route. The terrain along the route is also relatively flat, and it can also avoid the need to spend large sums of money to rebuild the bridge over the Fu River tributary. Therefore, it was decided to adopt the southern route. Around 1:00 PM on January 15th, the groundbreaking ceremony was held near the western abutment of the large Shu Fu River Bridge at Liangjiadu. The Railway Bureau set up an altar on a yellow earth mound. After the special train stopped at the site, Zeng Yangfu, Xiong Shihui, Huang Shaohong, and guests from all walks of life disembarked and walked there. After firecrackers were set off and the meeting commenced, Zeng Yangfu gave a brief report, expressing hope that they would continue the past spirit from the groundbreaking day and hold a grand inauguration ceremony for the Nanping section one and a half years later. Then, together with Xiong Shihui, Huang Shaohong, and Chinese and foreign guests, everyone picked up duck-bill hoes and shovels wrapped with red cloth and ribbons and performed the groundbreaking. In this way, over a hundred railway workers began construction.</p>
<p>Visit to the Fu River Bridge: The Fu River Bridge is the largest bridge on the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, with fourteen spans, a width of 35 *chi*, and a total length of 490 meters. It features steel plate girders, concrete piers, wooden piles, and concrete foundations, costing over 730,000 yuan. It is a bridge for both railway and highway use. The railway is located in the middle, for trains to pass, and triangular cantilever structures are extended on both sides (not yet completed) for cars to pass. At this time, the north wind was strong, but everyone walked across the bridge with great interest. Afterwards, the special train crossed the bridge again to pick up the guests and return to Nanchang. According to Zeng Yangfu, "If a highway bridge had to be built over the Fu River, it would have required 600,000 yuan. Now, by cantilevering off the railway bridge, it only cost 200,000 yuan, saving 400,000 yuan."</p>
<p>Lizhishi Banquet: The special train left Liangjiadu at 1:30 PM and returned to Nanchang. At 3:30 PM, it arrived at Nanchang Station. The guests then took public buses to the Lizhishi to attend the banquet hosted by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company. The Lizhishi is Nanchang's military club, built on a high ground by the Gan River. The building is I-shaped, palace-style, and three-stories, with one story underground. The auditorium can be used for speeches, plays, sports, banquets, and movies. There are commandments handwritten by Chiang Kai-shek. Although the decor cannot be said to be luxurious, it can be described as very clean and beautiful. Seats were arranged in the auditorium, in five vertical rows, accommodating over six hundred people. It is said that this was Nanchang's largest banquet in terms of the number of people. At 5:30 PM, Zeng Yangfu invited Chairman Xiong and Huang to take their seats, while he himself sat in the presiding seat. Western food was served, consisting of only one soup, one dish, and one dessert, but these six hundred-plus servings required knives, forks, and plates that reportedly had to be specially borrowed from Jiujiang. During the banquet, Zeng Yangfu rose to speak, thanking the guests for their presence and wishing them a pleasant journey. He also said, "Chairman Xiong has four major railway policies: the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Jiangxi-Fujian, Jiangxi-Guangdong, and Jiangxi-Anhui lines. Now, the inauguration ceremony for the Yunan section is being held, with more than six hundred guests. We hope that when the Nanping section opens next year, there will be twelve hundred guests, and we hope that Chairman Xiong will build an even larger dining hall than this one for us to feast the guests. Furthermore, we hope that when the Jiangxi-Guangdong section opens in the future, there will be forty-eight hundred guests; when the Jiangxi-Fujian section opens, there will be nine thousand guests; and when the Jiangxi-Anhui section opens, there will be tens of thousands of guests." This made everyone smile. Less than a minute after Zeng finished sitting, he suddenly rose again to speak, "For the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, we must also thank one person, and that is the Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Huang Shaohong. Everyone should raise a glass to him." Zeng's social skills can be seen from these instances. The banquet did not end until 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui's Progress: After the dinner, more than twenty reporters from Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Western newspapers jointly interviewed Xiong Shihui. Commissioner Xiao led them into the reception room, where they sat around in a circle, leaving a chair in the middle for Xiong to sit and talk. Ten minutes later, Xiong entered the room, wearing a yellow Zhongshan suit made of straight-woven silk. His hair was neatly combed, and he looked healthy. Considering he was almost forty years old, he still looked like a young soldier. However, judging from his words and actions, the arduous political life he had been living in Jiangxi in recent years had cultivated a restraint in his demeanor compared to his Shanghai days. He had the earnest and practical demeanor of a statesman. He answered almost all of the reporters' questions earnestly and specifically. He said, "Although the main force of the Red Army has left Jiangxi, small groups of bandits in remote areas of Jiangxi have not been completely eliminated, but they are absolutely not a cause for concern and will absolutely not return to Jiangxi. The construction of highways reached more than ten thousand kilometers last year, and construction is still actively underway this year. The earthwork and the transport of wood and stone are all done by the people, and the government is only paving the prepared materials." He also said, "Most of the land deeds and grain coupons in the Red areas have indeed been destroyed by the Communists, but now they are being reorganized using the Baojia system, which is even more perfect than the old system. This is because the Red Army did not flatten the field boundaries. Since most of Jiangxi is mountainous, leveling the field boundaries would prevent the fields in the mountainous areas from storing water. Moreover, if they were to carry out this work, the effort they would expend would be more troublesome than our construction of highways. Regarding Zhejiang, after the completion of the Yunan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, my intention is to give priority to supplying Zhejiang with the special products of our province, such as rice and grain, because Zhejiang still has to buy foreign rice. Agricultural cooperatives are now progressing smoothly. For example, the tangerines of Nanfeng are very famous. In the past, even Nanchang rarely saw them. Now, on the one hand, we are teaching them how to improve cultivation, and on the other hand, we are finding ways to transport and sell them. Now, not only does Nanchang have Nanfeng tangerines, but Shanghai also has them." He also said, "When President Chiang was stationed in Nanchang earlier this year, he was extremely concerned about the political construction and revitalization work in Jiangxi. Although he has now gone to Nanjing to preside over the central government affairs, he is unable to revisit Jiangxi, but his concern for the political situation in the province is as it was in the past and has not been forgotten. As for the thinking of the people in the province, before the bandits were eliminated, most of them held a passive attitude, but now they are all trending towards a more active one, so they are able to assist the government's political work with all their strength. For example, the construction of major highways and the completion of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are mostly due to the power of the people. What Director Zeng said just now, that I have four major railway policies, refers to the Jiangxi-Guangdong, Jiangxi-Fujian, Jiangxi-Zhejiang, and Jiangxi-Anhui trunk lines. Because I had previously advocated that merely completing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway would not fully serve the main trunk line south of the Yangtze River, I proposed the addition of the other three lines to extend to the southern provinces and become the center of the southeastern railway network. This plan is now being worked on in cooperation with all parties concerned." While Xiong was speaking, colleagues from Nanchang held a tea party at the Lizhishi, chatting happily during the gathering. Everyone only dispersed after 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Tea Party: According to the original schedule, guests were supposed to leave Nanchang on the night of the 15th after dinner at the Lizhishi. Later, because the Jiangxi Provincial Government scheduled a tea party for guests from all walks of life at the Provincial Government at 3:00 PM on the 16th, they stayed in Nanchang for another day. During these twenty-four hours, on the one hand, they could take the opportunity to sightsee in Nanchang City and nearby scenic spots, and on the other hand, they could also investigate several of the more important undertakings in Jiangxi and several of the works that the Provincial Government has been striving for recently. At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 16th, more than two hundred guests from all walks of life gathered in the grand auditorium of the Jiangxi Provincial Government for a grand tea party. Chairman Xiong and all the members of the Provincial Government personally served with diligence. First, attendants distributed a glass of "Cognac" wine to each guest, who drank and chatted at the same time. Tea and Western-style desserts were also prepared for guests to take at will, with freedom of movement and no restrictions. Although the format was simple, the meaning was very rich. It lasted for over an hour before dispersing. When dispersing, more than ten volumes of "Jiangxi Undertakings Series" and various outlines of the recent work of the Provincial Government were also distributed. After the tea party, guests rushed back to their hotels to pack their luggage. Before 5:00 PM, they gathered at Nanchang Station to board the train. Xiong Guangdu and all the members of the Provincial Committee and the heads of various agencies were also at the station to see them off. At 5:15 PM, our special train said goodbye to Nanchang amidst the melodious sound of military music. At 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, we arrived at the bank of the river. The special train returned to Shanghai that night.</p>
<p>Actively Revitalizing the Countryside: Jiangxi is entirely an agricultural province. After being severely damaged by the Red Bandits in the past few years, the bankruptcy of the countryside has reached an unimaginable state. Now, although they have been suppressed, the revitalization work can be considered the most difficult and arduous. After recovering the bandit areas, the Jiangxi Provincial Government devoted all its energy to this arduous revitalization work. In the past year, it has made considerable progress. The organization and work overview of their revitalization of the countryside is roughly as follows. Under the goal of revitalizing the countryside, the Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee, the Agricultural Institute, and the Jiangxi Rural Service Guidance Office of the National Economic Council have been established. The main work of the Rural Cooperative Committee is divided into three major categories: rural cooperation, such as cooperative education, cooperative administration, cooperative loans, and assistance in supply and transportation; rural economy, such as disaster relief for bandit-stricken rural areas and drought relief for rural areas; and rural land management. There is a total of 2 million yuan in funding, which is used exclusively for loans and various relief efforts. The main work of the Agricultural Institute includes the establishment of five departments: plant production, animal production, promotion, agricultural economics, and general affairs. It engages in the development of production and promotion. The start-up cost is 300,000 yuan, and the annual cost is 200,000 yuan. The Jiangxi Rural Service Guidance Office of the National Economic Council has established eight experimental areas throughout Jiangxi Province. Its main tasks are rural education, sanitation, cooperative guidance, livestock improvement, and disease prevention.</p>
<h2>Page 11</h2>
<p>According to news from the Provincial Government, this year's focus on rural revitalization work is on water conservancy, with water conservancy as the center of construction. The Provincial Water Conservancy Office has divided the entire province into eight major engineering offices, engaging in the following tasks: dike construction, tree planting, canal excavation, and river dredging. The method of conscription is implemented, that is, people perform labor service. Each able-bodied man performs labor service for a maximum of twenty days and a minimum of five days. The method of distribution is proportional to the amount of engineering work in a certain place and the number of able-bodied men. Also, the original population of Jiangxi Province was 24 million, but since the Red Bandits disrupted it, there are now only about 17 million.</p>
<p>Handling Rural Land</p>
<p>The rural land of Jiangxi Province has been repeatedly divided and surveyed by the Red Bandits, resulting in changes in boundaries, loss of deeds, and complicated and chaotic ownership and tenancy relationships, making disputes prone to occur. This has a huge impact on the stability of rural order and the recovery of unemployment. After Chairman Chiang promulgated the Regulations on the Handling of Rural Land in Various Provinces within the Bandit Suppression Area by the General Headquarters of the Three Provinces in the 21st year of the Republic, he redeployed to Nanchang and reiterated the previous order, actively implementing it. He also considered that rural affairs in the recovered areas were numerous and personnel were few, making it difficult to establish rural revitalization committees at all levels. Therefore, he used the articles of association of the Cooperative Preparatory Society to stipulate that each preparatory society should act as a rural committee in a township or town, so as to universally handle land ownership registration and other work. In January of last year, the headquarters also held a land handling training course to train land handling staff. In February, it ordered the Rural Cooperative Committee to direct these personnel to preside over the land handling affairs in the recovered counties and districts. Later, because it coincided with the spring plowing season, it based on the actual situation, using the shortest time, the least manpower, and the greatest efficiency as the criterion for carrying out this work. The handling situation is as follows: Maintenance after spring plowing and autumn harvest: After receiving orders in February last year, the Rural Cooperative Association selected cadres from the members of the headquarters' land training class to serve as land handling instructors, dividing them into fourteen counties and districts such as Lianhua, Yongxin, and Xiushui, where bandit disasters were more serious and land was more chaotic, to start work. It also guided and utilized the Cooperative Preparatory Society to properly mediate disputes between landowners and tenants, so as to ensure that spring plowing would not be delayed and autumn harvest would not cause disputes. It has resolved more than 200 land disputes. For fields that were abandoned due to tenancy disputes, after guidance and urging to increase reclamation, there were more than 18,000 *mu*. After the autumn harvest, it prevented landlords from forcing rent collection in 18 cases. It has indeed achieved considerable results in stabilizing the order of the recovered countryside. Handling land registration: In addition to guiding and utilizing the Cooperative Preparatory Society to mediate disputes between landowners and tenants, the land handling instructors in each county actively promoted the establishment of rural revitalization committees in each county and district to handle land registration work. According to reports from the heads of various county bureaus, 9 counties and districts, including Pingxiang and Shuhua, have established rural revitalization committees. Among them, Lianhua County alone registered more than 110,000 *mu* of land. Other county bureaus are still in progress. However, since September of last year, because the predetermined period expired and funding was unavailable, the Rural Cooperative Association has withdrawn these instructors. This handling work has been transferred to each county and district for separate supervision and continued handling.</p>
<p>Effectiveness of Special Education</p>
<p>Jiangxi Province has suffered from bandit disasters for many years, with almost four-fifths of the province falling into bandit areas. Wherever the Red Bandits passed, the local area was ravaged, the people were brutally killed, the social economy collapsed, and rural enterprises were destroyed. The severity of the damage is unprecedented. However, this is only the tangible bandit disaster, and the ideological poisoning suffered by the general public is truly frightening. The Red Bandits established Lenin Primary Schools, Public Clubs, and other reactionary educational institutions in the areas they occupied. Each county had hundreds of them, doing everything they could to numb and entice the people. As a result, the adults and children in the bandit areas exhibited abnormal and immoral consciousness and behavior. If measures are not taken to correct and remedy this, the consequences will be unimaginable. Chairman Chiang, seeing this, instructed the Jiangxi Provincial Government to establish schools as soon as the bandit areas were gradually recovered, so that children would have books to read and adults and able-bodied men would have the opportunity to make up for their education. All measures should not be bound by conventions and should be tailored to the specific circumstances to achieve the goal of subtle influence. The Provincial Government followed this instruction and, with reference to the Interim Measures for the Implementation of Social Education in Special Areas promulgated and implemented by the Central Standing Committee, implemented it in the recovered bandit areas to remedy the basic education of adults and children who had been communized, called Special Education. The Department of Education stipulated plans and started implementation, hoping to use the method of combining management, education, nurturing, and hygiene to provide the people in the recovered bandit areas with transformative, civic, vocational, and self-defense training to correct their thinking, build their character, develop their livelihoods, and support their survival, so as to achieve the ultimate goal of national revival. Special education is aimed at rescuing the bandit areas after their recovery, with education as the center, focusing on correcting the erroneous thinking of the people, training local self-defense, and increasing rural production. It aims to train the people and children to thoroughly understand the crimes of the Red Bandits and the fallacies of their arguments, so as to firmly believe in the Three Principles of the People and love the country; to train the people and children to have civic qualifications, self-defense capabilities, and productive skills, so as to achieve social peace and people's happy lives; to establish the foundation of education in the recovered bandit areas, and strive to promote it as a goal. The Provincial Government believes that the talents who implement special education must have special training. Therefore, in February of last year, it recruited two classes for the first training course, totaling 84 people. After four months of rigorous training, 80 people graduated. In June, it recruited a second term and expanded the training of special education teachers in the recovered counties in order to adapt to the needs of each county. It specially established two summer training classes and a research class to cultivate special education guidance talents in the recovered counties and seek the progress of special education. As a result of the recruitment, there were 84 people in the summer class, 91 people in the second training class, and 38 people in the research class. Afterwards, the training periods expired one after another. After passing the examinations, 83 people graduated from the former and 91 people graduated from the latter, and all have been assigned to serve in the recovered counties. In total, 254 students have graduated from various terms, and 38 students are still in school. Since the implementation of special education, it has achieved considerable results. If we continue to work hard and promote it continuously, in a few years, the people of the entire province will have self-reliant skills and sound character.</p>
<p>Decline of the Porcelain and Sugar Industries</p>
<p>The porcelain of Jingdezhen in Jiangxi has a long history of thousands of years. It is not only a specialty of Jiangxi, but also a precious product of China. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was at its peak. During the Qing dynasty, the Jingdezhen Imperial Porcelain Factory was renamed the Imperial Kiln Factory. During the Qianlong period, Tang Ying, an official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, was appointed to supervise the Imperial Kiln Factory, bringing together skilled workers and concentrating on craftsmanship. The style was modeled on the simple and rustic style of ancient porcelain, and the colorful and gorgeous style of Western enamel. Other techniques such as porcelain plate photography and lifelike painting were also used. At that time, the factories competed with each other, constantly innovating. Therefore, it enjoyed a reputation throughout the world, and sales were extremely brisk. Unfortunately, after its peak, Jingdezhen suffered many military disasters, resulting in huge losses. By the time of the opening of the five ports, foreign porcelain poured in again, and the porcelain industry of Jingdezhen declined sharply. Since the Republic of China, no special management has been set up for porcelain administration, and it has been allowed to grow and die on its own. After 1919, it was repeatedly ravaged by the Red Bandits, and its decline deepened. In its heyday, there were hundreds of kilns and hundreds of thousands of workers. Porcelain exports reached countries in Europe and the United States, and the total annual turnover was often around 20 million yuan. According to a recent survey by people in the porcelain industry, in the past two years, the total annual value of porcelain exports was less than four to five million yuan, and the amount of porcelain exported overseas has dropped to fifty to sixty thousand *dan*. The extent of its decline is truly heartbreaking. The provincial authorities have long had plans for improvement, but they have been hampered by financial difficulties. It is now known that the Provincial Government has established the Jiangxi Pottery Administration Bureau in Jingdezhen in order to promote the development of the porcelain industry, so as to carry out rectification and improvement. Chinese sugar production used to occupy an important position in the world. Jiangxi's sugar industry also ranks third in the country. In its peak years, annual production exceeded 300,000 *dan*, not only being self-sufficient, but also having a surplus for sale outside the province. In recent years, production has decreased daily and sales have stagnated. Those who used to supply other provinces are now relying on others. The degree of degradation is shocking, and the loss of resources is great. Now that the Red Bandits have been suppressed, efforts are being made to revive various industries. Therefore, plans are being made to restore this sugar industry, which once had a good reputation. It is now known that the Provincial Government has resolved to send personnel to carry and prepare forms, and to conduct field investigations in various sugar-producing areas. After the survey is obtained and the customs report is received, a systematic statistics and research will be made on the various situations of sugar cane planting and sugar production in the province and the dumping of foreign sugar. The Provincial government will also conduct a systematic statistical study and research, and will realistically rectify the areas where sugarcane planting and sugar production in this province should be improved and supported.</p>
<p>Nanchang News Industry: In recent years, the news industry in Nanchang has made considerable progress due to the government's and people's recognition of the great relationship between the news industry and the country, society, politics, economy, and culture, and their vigorous support and promotion, as well as the efforts of colleagues to seek progress and struggle. Whether in terms of speech, editing, or business, it has progressed more than before. According to the reporter's investigation, the general situation is as follows: News agencies include the Central News Agency branch, the Jiangxi News Agency sponsored by the Provincial Party Headquarters, and the private Kuanglu News Agency and Jiangxi News Agency; Newspapers include the Republican Daily sponsored by the Provincial Party Headquarters, which publishes three major sheets every day, with a daily circulation of about 2,500 copies, and monthly advertising revenue of about 600 yuan; the Xinwen Bao, which publishes two and a half sheets every day (the Provincial Government subsidizes a portion of the funds each month), with a daily circulation of over 1,000 copies, and monthly advertising revenue of 400 to 500 yuan; the Min Bao, which publishes two and a half sheets every day, with monthly advertising revenue of over 600 yuan, and a daily circulation of about 1,000 copies; the Gongshang Bao, which publishes two and a half sheets every day, with a smaller circulation, and monthly advertising revenue of 400 to 500 yuan; and the Shang Bao, which publishes two and a half sheets every day, with a smaller circulation and monthly advertising revenue of 200 to 300 yuan. In addition, there are evening newspapers (half sheet) and small newspapers, with a daily circulation of several hundred copies, but the advertising revenue is unknown. Other larger counties have small stone-printed newspapers, but most of them are run by the Party Headquarters. Also, in order to avoid difficulties in work and unify the records, the reporters of various newspapers in Nanchang organized a reporters' interview team in December of last year. According to this kind of organization, it may hinder the progress of the newspaper, but in a special environment, it only serves as a transitional measure, and it seems harmless. (Huating)</p>
<h3 id="e58">Activities of the Mongolian Security Forces in Western Suiyuan: Zhuo Shihai's Troops Display Unusual Movements, Telegraphing Li Shou-hsin's Puppet Troops Arriving at Daqingmen, Kang Wang Passing Through Suiyuan to Jin to Report on Anti-Communism <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Over two hundred men of the Mongolian Security Forces set out for western Suiyuan five days ago. According to recent reports, the security forces have advanced to a point seventy li from Pingdiquan in Suiyuan, and are still progressing. However, their advance avoids the railway line, so their destination remains unclear. The Jin-Suiyuan authorities are paying close attention to this. After arriving at Zhangbei, Zhuo Shihai's unit of the Mongolian Security Forces issued a telegraph on the 17th indicating unusual movements, ending with the inscription "Year 736 of Genghis Khan." Li Shou-hsin's puppet troops from Chahar North arrived at Daqingmen, a strategic point on the Shangdu highway, on the 17th. After Chahar Chairman Zhang Zizhong returned to Zhangjiakou, a telegram was sent to Beiping reporting on the current situation in Chahar North, stating that Li Shou-hsin's puppet troops remained in Shangdu, and administrative affairs in the counties were proceeding as usual without major changes. Communist bandits in northern Shaanxi are inciting the populace and their influence is very rampant. Inner Mongolian princes and dukes of the Ulanqab League and the Ordos League are paying attention to anti-communism because they are close in proximity to northern Shaanxi. Kang Wang, concurrently commander-in-chief of anti-communism in the Ordos League and commander of bandit suppression in the Dalad Banner, traveled from his banner to Suiyuan on the night of the 16th. On the 17th, he met with Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi to discuss the anti-communist situation in the Ordos League and to request instructions on joint defense measures between the Ordos League and Suiyuan. The anti-communist situation in Inner Mongolia is quite comprehensive. Pan Degongzhabu, the Jasagh of the Siziwang Banner of the Ulanqab League, established the Mongolian Banner Bandit Suppression District Command in Suiyuan. Baobaoduorji, the deputy league leader of the Ulanqab League, organized the Sui North Railway Protection Deputy Command in Baotou. Kangdaoduorji, the Jasagh of the Dalad Banner, also established the Ordos League Seven Banners Anti-Communist Headquarters and the Bandit Suppression District Command in Baotou. Aletan'eqiqier, the Jasagh of the Hanggin Banner and deputy league leader of the Ordos League, installed telephones in the Hanggin Banner to form a communication network. Tubushengjiergele, the Jasagh of the Ordos League County Prince Banner, is implementing the Baojia system in his banner. All of these measures are preparations for anti-communism. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">Min Security Regiment Commander Zhan Fangzhen Detained <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>—Zhan Was Originally a Notorious Bandit in Southern Fujian—Xiamen Dispatch: Zhan Fangzhen, the commander of the 7th Security Regiment, was originally a notorious bandit in southern Fujian, rampaging in the Anxi, Hua'an, and Zhangping counties for over a decade. Last year, he was persuaded by Suiyuan and incorporated into the provincial government forces. Wu Zhuzhong, the commander of the 2nd Battalion of his regiment, was from Zhan's original bandit forces. Ye Chengqing, the commander of the 1st Battalion, and Wang Zizhiwang, the commander of the 3rd Battalion, were transferred from other local militias after incorporation and integration. On the morning of the 16th, Zhan traveled from Zhangzhou to Zhangpu in his private car with the Security Department inspection committee members Jiang Lei and Hu Jiwu. They stayed at the Weisheng Lou Hotel. At 7 p.m., he was summoned by Chen Qi, the commander of the 80th Division, and went to the division headquarters to meet Chen. Chen immediately ordered Zhan's detention. The 7th Regiment's office in Zhangzhou was also searched, one of Zhan's guards was arrested, and Zhan's private car was impounded. To prevent leaks, long-distance telephone lines from Zhangzhou to Zhangpu and Punan were cut off that night. At the same time, a secret telegram was sent to the 80th Division troops stationed in Zhangpu to disarm the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Battalions of Zhan's regiment during roll call at 7 a.m. on the 17th. Subsequently, Wang, the brigade commander of the 80th Division's 239th Brigade, and Chen, the brigade commander of the Independent 39th Brigade, arrived in Zhangpu from Zhangzhou. After addressing the officers and soldiers of the 1st Battalion under Ye Chengqing and the 2nd Battalion under Wang Zhigang, the firearms were returned to them. Furthermore, the 80th Division headquarters ordered the troops stationed in Punan on the evening of the 16th to detain Zhan's family members residing in Punan. During the arrest, Zhan's family guards resisted, resulting in one death and one serious injury. Zhan's wife, concubines, children, and nephews, four people were arrested. The 80th Fujian Division's detention of Zhan was carried out based on a secret telegram from the Security Department. The operation was extremely secretive and swift. Zhangzhou, Zhangpu, and Punan took simultaneous action to resolve the situation overnight. The reasons for Zhan's detention are still unknown. However, it is undeniable that Zhan was originally a notorious bandit in southern Fujian with poor discipline. There must be a reason for resolving the situation. (January 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">The 80th Division Stationed in Zhangzhou Resolves the Zhangzhou Secret Service Team: The Team Is Accused of Indiscipline <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Thirty-Nine Killed During Disarmament Xiamen Dispatch The Special Service First Team of the Investigation Department of the Zhangzhou Garrison Headquarters, led by Zheng Yuanlong, the deputy team leader Wu Jinlai, the Second Team led by Hong Haojie, and the Third Team leader Zhang Yuting were formed by integrating local bandits from Zhangzhou and affiliated with the Investigation Department of the Garrison Headquarters as a special service team, stationed in the southeast suburbs of the city. However, even after being incorporated, they continued to be undisciplined, extorting the villagers in the four suburban areas and privately collecting donations. The people repeatedly presented complaints to Chen Qi, the commander of the 80th Division and the Zhangzhou Garrison Commander. Commander Chen summoned Zheng, Hong, Zhang, and others several times, sternly warning them to mend their ways. However, they ultimately did not change. In recent months, the accumulated complaints piled up. On the 14th, Commander Chen dispatched personnel to the southeastern villages to summon the three team leaders and all the troops into the city, ostensibly for roll call and verification of firearms. The three teams did not suspect anything. At 10 a.m. on the 15th, First Team Leader Zheng Yuanlong led 28 men, Second Team Leader Hong Haojie led 28 men, and Third Team Leader Zhang Yuting led 24 men into the city one after another, gathering at Zhongshan Park. Prior to this, all soldiers of the 478th Regiment under the 80th Division, led by Du Kan, were fully armed and guarded inside and outside Zhongshan Park. At 11 a.m., the three teams gathered in front of the memorial platform in Zhongshan Park to listen to the roll call. The special service team was in the front row, followed by hundreds of soldiers from the 80th Division's 478th Regiment. Soldiers guarded the park's left, right, front, and rear gates, preventing pedestrians from passing through. The division headquarters' special service company was also fully mobilized. It was originally hoped that the firearms of the team would be confiscated, and after training by personnel dispatched by the division headquarters, they would be re-assigned. At around 11 a.m., Regiment Commander Du addressed all the team members, ultimately urging them to abide by discipline and obey orders. He also recounted the various complaints against each team, and announced that he was now ordered to have each team submit their firearms for verification, and personnel would be dispatched for training. Unexpectedly, the soldiers of each team disobeyed. During Regiment Commander Du's address, they each loaded their guns with bullets, preparing to resist. Commander Du remained calm, ordering them not to load bullets and summoning the three team leaders to the front for earnest persuasion, ordering the three team leaders to order their teams to turn in their guns. Unexpectedly, the three team leaders refused and loudly protested. At that time, following behind the three team leaders were a platoon leader and a soldier from the 478th Regiment, both armed and monitoring them. When Zheng and others loudly protested, the team soldiers heard from afar, and also shouted and killed, and each used their guns to fire at the 478th Regiment soldiers behind them, and try to escape. The 478th Regiment soldiers immediately scattered and returned fire. Suddenly, the sounds of gunfire boomed, and the city residents fled in alarm, shops closed, and the main roads of the city were temporarily under curfew. As a result, besides those killed on the spot, the rest escaped over the short walls of the park, fleeing into the civilian houses in the Lianzi Street and Xiehe Road area. The army split up to search for them. A rebel soldier ran into the Chen Gui house at 16 Lianzi Street, where Chen's father and wife were. When the army arrived, they ordered them to escape quickly in order to open fire, but the two trembled and could not move. The rebel soldier took the opportunity to open fire, and the army swept with submachine guns, finally killing him. Chen's father was shot in the foot and his wife in the leg. Also, one soldier was killed in an empty house at No. 36. By a little after 12 o'clock, it finally settled down. Inside and outside the park were filled with corpses bathed in blood. Afterwards, it was determined that those killed on the spot included First Team Leader Zheng Yuanlong, Second Team Leader Hong Haojie, and squad leaders and soldiers Feng Tianshui, Zhang Dabao, Xu Qisheng, Wang Jiao, Xu Shuilong, Hong Shuisheng, Hong Mingyuan, Zheng Qiwen, Yan Lintian, Feng Ren, Zhang Ou, Zhang Jinshou, Chen Baishui, Zheng Rengen, Chen Sun, Hong Jinming, Zheng Shishi.</p>

In addition, there are five corpses whose names are unknown. The above total is 39 killed. Those captured alive included Third Team Leader Zhang Yuting, Qiu Huang, squad leaders and soldiers Zhang Youde, Zhang Long, Zhang Shou, Zeng Yuanhe, Yang Shuizhan, Chen Chiru, Zheng Bao, Hu Cheng, Chen Youshui, Zhang Jinming, Yan Dong, Yang Zhengyi, Zheng Erlai, Lin Lushu, Zhang Gen, Wang Shuhua, all uninjured, Huang Songgen, Zheng Yuan, Huang Zhen, Cai Qingmiao, Zhang Yong, Wu Bie, Lin Guoqing, Hong Weichen, Hong Shuixuan, Hong Abi, Yan Dian, Zhang Shui, all seriously injured, Wang Changjia, Ye Kun, Hong Lu, Hong Zao, all uninjured. It was found that only seven soldiers of the three teams escaped. Also, Wu Jinlai, the deputy team leader of the First Team, did not enter the city and escaped. Twelve rifles, thirty-four Mauser pistols and other short guns, and four submachine guns, a total of fifty guns, were seized. (January 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e61">Fuzhou Financial Relief Association Established: Sixty to Seventy Merchants Apply for Mortgages; Only a Few Qualify for Loans <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: After the establishment of the Fuzhou Financial Relief Committee, the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications have allocated 1 million legal tender to be loaned to merchants through the Provincial Bank. Recently, sixty to seventy merchants have brought their property deeds to the Relief Association to apply for mortgages. However, the conditions set by the association are very strict:</p>
<p>The property must be owned by the applicant.</p>
<p>The property must be insured against fire.</p>
<p>The deed must have been taxed and registered with the court.</p>
<p>Repayment must be guaranteed by a merchant shop with substantial capital.</p>
<p>As a result, only a few have qualified for loans. However, the Southeast Bank has received 150,000 yuan and will begin disbursing 50% of the banknotes on the 20th. Tianji Money Exchange will also begin disbursing 50% of the banknotes on the 22nd. The remaining 50% will be disbursed on a regular basis after debt settlement. Small insurance companies have also borrowed 70,000 yuan for lending to policyholders. The money exchanges originally planned to borrow 300,000 yuan from the Provincial Bank to lend to merchants. Now, due to the excessively strict conditions set by the Financial Relief Association, they fear taking responsibility and have stopped borrowing. As for the merchants, they are divided into two factions. Those with real estate to mortgage are asking the Relief Association to change the loan methods: 1. Remove the merchant shop guarantee. 2. Provide loans first and then register. It is unknown if this will be approved. However, there are only a few days left until the end of the year, and most merchants have not received the loans, so they are very anxious. Those without real estate to mortgage believe that the tightness of money this year is many times worse than in previous years. The meager 800,000 yuan (because 150,000 yuan for the Southeast Bank and 70,000 yuan for small insurance are unrelated to the merchants) cannot provide relief. Yesterday, they jointly requested the County Chamber of Commerce to allow the closing period to be extended to the second day of the second month of the lunar new year. Two-thirds would be repaid at the end of the lunar year, and the remainder would be settled when due. However, this is inconsistent with business customs and is unlikely to be realized. Furthermore, Fuzhou's commercial decline last year reached its peak. Exports of all kinds of special products such as tea, wood, paper, and bamboo shoots have plummeted. Nine out of ten shops are losing money. It is expected that more tea, wood, paper, and bamboo shoot merchants will close down this year than last year. The Jiangsu-Guangdong guilds and silk and cloth guilds have decided to reduce their scale uniformly starting next lunar year, laying off some shop assistants or reducing salaries. The Yunwen and Jiulong stores on South Street in the city have already implemented this first. Therefore, the shop assistants of general stores are worried about unemployment and are extremely anxious. However, in the administrative and education sectors, the funds coordinated by the Ministry of Finance and Education have been remitted in advance. January salaries can be paid on the 21st, which is quite optimistic. As for the poor, charitable organizations in previous years have all organized end-of-year assistance. This year, due to the depression of commercial activities, it is not easy to donate money, and all organizations have suspended it. However, the Provincial New Sports Association, the Provincial Relief Association, the Red Cross Society, and the Red Swastika Society are jointly organizing winter relief: Each person will receive four jiao of silver, and each person will receive five sheng of white rice, limited to 5,000 people.

<h3 id="e62">Bandit Liu's Rampant Activities: Gathers Bandits from Outside the Pass, Plans to Flee South, Incited by Some Party, Briefly Captures Laiyuan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Liu Guitang recently gathered bandits on the border of Hebei and Chahar, including Zhang Haijiao and Da Wanglong outside the Great Wall. He also gathered Fei Yun, Wang Yanru and other bandits as well as two companies of cavalry from Xia Ziming's regiment, which had defected in eastern Chahar, using the Yanhai, Sihai, and Yongning Forts of Yanqing as bases. They are receiving supplies of guns and ammunition from a certain country and changing into blue cloth uniforms and wearing the East Asian Alliance emblem. They are divided into several groups and fleeing south across the Great Wall, wanting to use the old route of the 23rd Army to reach the junction of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, to join forces with Liu Zhinan, Zhao Dehuai, and other bandit gangs in western Shandong, northern Henan, and southern Hebei to launch a major operation. Since the winter solstice, Liu himself led an army of thousands, intending to cross southwest to Hebei, but was repeatedly blocked by the 29th and 50th Army units and failed. The bandits then fled back to western Hebei, intending to enter Yuxian County in Chahar Province and go west to western Suiyuan, to invade Inner Mongolia. Just as they were fleeing to the border of Yuxian County, they were intercepted by Dong Shengtang's regiment of Zhang Zizhong's division of the 29th Army. At the same time, the Jin army, fearing the bandits would flee into their territory, sent a regiment to intercept them near Longquanguan. The bandits were forced to turn back south again. The majority have returned to their old nest in the Yanhai and Sihai areas of Yanqing, lying low and waiting for an opportunity. Jin Huanwen (Liu's chief of staff) is leading 1,000 men from Fei Yun, including 400 cavalry and 700 infantry, carrying five steel cannons and over ten light and heavy machine guns. On the 5th, they fled to Wulonggou in Yixian County, and on the 6th, they fled to Majiacun. Having heard that the main force of the 29th Army was coming from Quyang to suppress them, they returned to take advantage of the emptiness, and on the evening of the 7th, they attacked and entered Laiyuan County. The county's local defense forces were weak, so the bandits were allowed to enter the city. The county magistrate and the chief of public security took the seal and fled to Lingqiu, Jin, to conduct their affairs. On the one hand, they telegraphed the province for help. After the bandits occupied Laiyuan, the cavalry were stationed outside the city, and the infantry were stationed inside the city. Villages within thirty miles of the county seat were raped and looted. The wealthy families in the city were all searched, and hundreds of men and women were kidnapped for ransom. The chamber of commerce president was forced to supply 5,000 yuan and 200 guns. The president of the Chamber of Commerce could not provide it and was also kidnapped. They occupied the area for two days. Dong's local defense troops from Yuxian were ordered to take the north of Laiyuan directly. Li's regiment of Feng Zhian's division of the 29th Army came to help from Dingxian, dividing their troops to take Wulongkou, Jinshuikou, and Huang'anling to cut off the bandits' route south. Gao's regiment of the Jin army left Lingqiu to attack the west of Laiyuan. On the afternoon of the 9th, the telephone and telegraph lines of Laiyuan, Quyang, Yixian, Wanxian, and Tangxian were destroyed by bandits, and news could not get through. There was a great shock. The local defense forces of each county were all transferred to the border to guard it. Villagers from each county fled in droves. On the night of the 9th, the bandits learned that the government army was attacking in three directions, and they abandoned the city in a panic, fleeing through the borders of Yixian and Laiyuan counties, crossing villages such as Caicungang, Chajianling, and Shizhuangpu, looting along the way. At 11 a.m. on the 10th, they had fled to Zoumayi, posing a threat to Anxin in the south via Tangxian and Wanxian counties. The Second Regiment of the 53rd Army arrived in Tangxian in the afternoon of the 10th to block the bandits from fleeing south. Li's regiment of the 29th Army followed closely behind the bandits. As of the afternoon of the 11th, the bandits were divided into infantry and cavalry, some fleeing towards Yixian and Tangxian counties, and some fleeing towards Wanxian and Anxin counties. The counties in the heart of Hebei Province were in a panic due to the approaching end of the year. The counties telegraphed the province one after another, asking to send troops to block them quickly. However, since the 29th Army was transferred to garrison and the 32nd Army was sent south, and most of the 53rd Army was also transferred to Shaanxi and Gansu to undertake bandit suppression work, the province was so vast that the military strength was actually insufficient. Therefore, Bandit Liu's decision to lead his troops to flee east and west has left the defenses of each county empty. Although the troops have been mobilized to intercept them, opportunities have been repeatedly lost, resulting in the failure to completely eliminate them. Furthermore, the bandit gang has a significant background and is supplied with guns and ammunition, with heavy weapons to confront the government army, so the disaster is even worse than in the past.

<h3 id="e63">Shortage of Subsidiary Currency in Guangdong Province: Retail Trade Greatly Affected; Authorities Begin to Recast Copper Coins <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After Guangdong Province abolished the use of silver fractional currency and implemented legal tender, legal tender has circulated without obstruction. However, the market suddenly lacked several tens of millions of two-jiao silver coins, which caused great inconvenience to trade. The authorities have rushed to print five-mao and two-mao fractional notes for issuance. However, each issuance is only two to three hundred thousand yuan, and small transactions in society are still extremely difficult. Furthermore, unscrupulous merchants seized the opportunity to buy up these small fractional notes, manipulating them for profit. Therefore, small fractional notes on the market are becoming increasingly scarce. As a result, one yuan of legal tender is only equivalent to nine jiao of small fractional notes. Consumers are, in effect, suffering losses, while stores are reducing their business due to a lack of small fractional coins for change. At the same time, hawkers are adopting a tightening policy due to the rising prices of fractional notes and copper coins, and the business of hawkers has become bleak. Therefore, at this urgent and challenging time of year, Guangdong Province's finances have suddenly presented a tight shortage.</p>
<p>The financial authorities, in order to alleviate the panic of small subsidiary currency, have recently started to mint new-style copper coins for uniform use, divided into one-fen and half-fen denominations. Ten one-fen coins are equivalent to one jiao, and twenty half-fen coins are equivalent to one jiao. The Department of Finance will set up an office to buy old copper coins and recast them. The fineness of the copper coins is said to be 95% bronze and 5% zinc-lead. An initial 4 million coins will be minted for circulation. As for the design of the new copper coins, the front will be engraved with Sun Yat-sen's image, and the back will be printed with the year of manufacture and the denomination. The Department of Finance has dispatched personnel to the mint to repair the factory buildings and repair the coin-minting machines. It is expected that a trial run can be carried out at the end of this month. If it goes smoothly, large-scale minting can officially begin in the middle of next month. In order to save the treasury and utilize waste, in addition to the copper that must be purchased, the military agencies plan to allocate the copper shells of bullets stored for bronze smelting. After this news came out, speculators are now rushing to buy old copper coins to hoard them, so the price of old copper coins on the market has suddenly risen. In the past, one jiao could be exchanged for 32 coins, but soon only 24 coins could be exchanged. Recently, only 20 coins can be exchanged. However, daily commodity prices have not fallen due to the high price of copper coins. (January 11th)</p>

<p>Wangmashan in the northwestern township of this county, 18 li from the city, connects to Qingpu in the north, making it an important transportation route between Songjiang and Qingpu. The town's commerce has always been prosperous, with about several thousand households. Since Magistrate Li's arrival, he has paid much attention to the town's security, occasionally sending provincial security teams and water patrol teams to patrol and stand guard. In addition to the original public security branch office in the town, there are also two groups of local defense guards. The first group is led by Zhang Tianmin, chairman of the town's Chamber of Commerce, and the second group is led by Zhang Shouchang, the leader of the Huangni Mountain stone quarry. These groups were formed from the quarry workers. Unexpectedly, last night (the 18th) at around 12 o'clock, the second group of local defense guards colluded with bandits. While on patrol in Shenjia Lane, they suddenly killed the squad leader Qian Jinghao in the Lujing Port area, then turned around and shouted into the town, surrounding the town. The Yuchang Winery was the first to be looted. Upon hearing the alarm, Zhang Tianmin, the director of the first group, led his team to bravely resist, and they were repelled. The detailed amount of losses to shops and civilian households is still being investigated. After receiving the report, the county magistrate dispatched a team to pursue them. More details will be reported later.</p>

<p>Huang Jinxi, a resident of Duanjia Village, Haitang Township, Third District, near the Xida Wang Temple outside the West Gate of Wuyi, opened the Yuanfenghong Wood Company in Qingji Bridge, and his family was well-off. Recently, he was marrying off his son, which attracted the attention of bandits. On the night of the 17th of this month, at around 11 p.m., more than a dozen bandits suddenly arrived, holding two box guns. They used a poplar tree to break open the gate and rushed in, forcing the homeowner to reveal where he had hidden his money, overturning boxes and cabinets, and arbitrarily searching. Huang's wife, Zhang, heard the alarm and called for help. The bandits raised their guns and shot, killing her. Then they looted all the jewelry, clothes, and silver dollars in the new house. They carried the loot and escaped to the east after about an hour. Afterwards, the watch post sounded the gong to round them up, but the bandits had already gone far away and could not be pursued.</p>

<p>Since the field transportation and food merchant office was ordered to be abolished, a total of 108 internal staff were all unemployed. After that, the former salt commissioner Miao issued severance pay for two months. The laid-off personnel then requested the field supervisors and chambers of commerce, for support. It was originally agreed that aid would be provided and two months of support would be allocated. The above said that the allocated funds were being deducted by the salt commissioner, which resulted in no ability to allocate the two months of funds. Although laid off personnel have communicated with the above repeatedly to request the funds, as of today the request has not been fulfilled. Recently it was heard that personnel that have been laid off for a long time are unable to survive, so on the 16th and 17th of this month, they brought their wives and children to the salt commissioner to request aid from the person in charge of the meeting, Shen Minzhu. It was agreed that they would allocate 300 yuan, and that amount would be split among the 108 people, the allocation was minimal.</p>

<p>The presiding old Taoist priest, Dao Xing, of the Chunyang Temple at Xin Feng Dian in Yushan, because the temple has a small amount of farmland, and there is a surplus every year in addition to expenses, unexpectedly aroused the coveting of villains. On the afternoon of the 18th, a young man suddenly came to the temple, presenting a letter and requesting to see Dao Xing. After being seen, the young man handed over the letter and left. Dao Xing opened and read it, and was horrified to find it was a threatening letter, demanding a loan of 250 yuan in foreign currency, signed "Youth Blood Corps." However, the location for payment was not specified. After reading it, the Taoist priest was extremely frightened, as there were no neighbors in the high mountains and no help could be called. He has now reported to the Public Security Bureau, requesting protection. It is said that these youth groups are actually hooligan organizations inside and outside the city, and the authorities have already paid attention to them.</p>

<p>The Xiaoshan County Government received an order from the provincial government stating that at the beginning of the implementation of the new currency policy by the Ministry of Finance, Article 8 of the Measures for Exchanging Legal Tender was required. Article 1 of the measures stipulated that all holders of silver were required to exchange it for legal tender within three months from November 4th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, which was due to expire on February 3rd of this year. Currently, there are still many places where silver and silver coins have not been exchanged for legal tender as scheduled, and many remote areas still lack the circulation of legal tender and urgently need its promotion. Therefore, the deadline should be appropriately extended to benefit merchants and promote its implementation. It is now ordered by the ministry to continue the original deadline from February of this year, which has been reported to the Executive Yuan for record, and to notify all provincial and county governments and relevant authorities to comply. This county has already complied.</p>

<p>The Shaoshan Linpu Town Chamber of Commerce has been jointly organized by shops in Shaoshan and Xiaoshan counties since the Xuan統 years of the late Qing Dynasty, using the name "Shaoshan Linpu Town Chamber of Commerce." In December, the county government asked the county government of this county, on the instructions of the Construction Department, to organize the town's chamber of commerce according to administrative regions, with each county separately organizing its town chamber of commerce. The chamber of commerce believes that separate organization would not only lead to a lack of talent and difficulties in selecting staff, but also limited funding, making it difficult to develop the chamber's affairs. According to the membership list, there are only over 140 shops in the entire town, excluding Zhu Mu, who joined the trade association. Over 100 of these are in Xiaoshan, who can organize on their own, while less than 50 are in Shaoxing, making it impossible to organize independently. Although the town is divided between Shaoshan and Xiaoshan counties, the shops are still close to each other. The reasons for not being able to separate were explained to the county party headquarters, which then forwarded the situation to the provincial and central departments for review. Yesterday, instructions were received from the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters stating that since the laws and regulations have changed, the town's chamber of commerce should be organized separately. Yesterday, the county party headquarters forwarded the order to the town's chamber of commerce for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Rural Life Talks <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtang</p>
<p>Land Relationships and Agricultural Management in Lingjiaqiao, Hang County - Guo Renquan</p>
<p>The author has been residing in Lingjiaqiao for less than two months. The following narrative consists mostly of scattered facts gleaned by the author from conversations with several local elderly farmers.</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>To understand the overview of Lingjiaqiao, one must first talk about the Shangsi District to which Lingjiaqiao belongs. The Shangsi District is located in the southeastern part of Hang County, with half of its district boundary being the bank of the Qiantang River. The entire district is divided into twenty-one townships, plus the town of Zhoujiapu. There are many small mountains rising from the ground within the district, with the mountain area totaling 100,000 mu, accounting for one-third of the total area of the district. The area of paddy fields, on the other hand, is only slightly less than 90,000 mu. Of these 90,000 mu of paddy fields, it is estimated with reasonable certainty that more than 60% are occupied by officials and merchants in the urban area of Hangzhou. Therefore, the 140,000 to 150,000 shi of rice that can be produced from these 90,000 mu of fields can hardly feed the 49,000 farmers in the entire district after deducting 50,000 to 60,000 shi of rent rice. The god of hunger drives these farmers to develop the mountains, and growing tea and planting bamboo become the main secondary occupations of the farmers in this district. The entire district has 26,000 mu of tea mountains and tea land, and over 14,000 mu of bamboo forests. Sericulture and duck farming also play an important role in the livelihood of farm families in some villages in this district. What is particularly noteworthy is duck farming. In Xinlan Township, many forest households simply regard it as their only main business. Most of them live on the sandy beaches along the Qiantang River, living in thatched huts. When you approach their residences, you can hear the sound of "Gha! Gha! Gha!" constantly coming from the thatched sheds from hundreds of paces away.</p>
<p>Lingjiaqiao, a village of about 250 households, is located in the center of a township in the Shangsi District – Dingshan Township. Because of its central location and convenient transportation (the Hangfu Highway passes through here, only forty minutes away from Hangzhou), political and educational institutions such as the supervisor's office, the field tax collection office, the permit issuance office, and the Zhejiang Provincial Experimental Public Education Hall are all located here. At the same time, because there are no larger towns near Lingjiaqiao, there are also several small shops opened here, such as tea houses, pharmacies, barbershops, grocery stores, etc., which do not make it a purely rural village.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>Among the approximately 250 households in the village, one landlord owns 100 mu of land, and five or six larger self-cultivating farmers and landlords each own 30 to 50 mu of land. For the remaining farm families, being able to own and cultivate a few mu of their own fields is considered very fortunate. More than half of the farm families cultivate purely rented fields. Fortunately, most of them have a few mu or fen of hillside land of their own, and as long as the hillside is not covered with uncultivable rocks, they have already cultivated it and planted tea trees. Most of the farm families' expenses depend on the income from selling tea in the spring season. Relying solely on a few mu of rented paddy fields, it is feared that many farm families cannot even maintain their food supply. Therefore, the price of tea is truly the lifeline of the farmers in Lingjiaqiao. The price of tea this spring is worse than in previous years, and it has already posed a considerable threat to the majority of farm families.</p>
<p>The rented fields cultivated by the farmers in Lingjiaqiao, like other villages in the Shangsi District, are mostly owned by officials and merchants in the urban area of Hangzhou. As early as fifty or eighty years ago, those officials and merchants entrusted reliable people to buy in large quantities in this village. "Land is the property of descendants for all generations." The officials and merchants all had such an understanding, investing their extorted wealth in the countryside, planting a solid, lasting network of bloodsucking. They spent scarce silver (only about ten yuan per mu), but received a continuous supply of white rice over the years. Precisely because their purpose was "white rice," they often did not pay attention to the location and quality of the fields when they bought them. Some farmers, because they were too poor, hoped to get a higher price for their fields and even sold three mu as four mu. The buyers only needed to receive the rent rice for four mu, so why bother asking about the actual size of the field?</p>
<p>Rent collectors want rent rice. As long as these tenant farmers do not owe rent rice, they can enjoy the right to cultivate permanently. The author has visited many farmers and asked them about the term of their tenancy for a certain paddy field. Their answers were often: "It was the ancestral property sold by our grandfather, and we have been cultivating it for sixty or seventy years." This de facto permanent cultivation has not formed the so-called perpetual tenancy. The farmers here have never heard of terms such as "Min Ke Tian" (people's guest land) or "Da Xiao Mai" (big and small sale). When they are too poor to pay the rent rice, they can only watch their paddy fields being cultivated by others. They often panic: What will happen if we can't pay the rent, and the tenancy is revoked?</p>
<p>The rent for the urban landlords' fields is fixed, ranging from five dou to one shi per mu, with six dou to eight dou being common. The 25% rent reduction is generally implemented here. Before the 16th year of the Republic, rent was collected as is. From the 16th to 18th years of the Republic, rent was paid at 37.5% of the estimated total harvest. From the 19th year of the Republic, the method of estimating the total harvest was abolished, and rent was paid at a 25% discount on the original rent amount for each rented field.</p>
<p>One landlord and five or six wealthy farmers in this village also rent out a total of 170 to 180 mu of land to the poor farmers in the village. Some small landlords in the village, aware of how urgently the poor farmers in the village need land, therefore collect relatively higher rents, either dividing the harvest at a ratio of 4 (landlord) to 6 (tenant), or setting a fixed rent amount without a 25% rent reduction, because they themselves feel that the burden of field taxes has not been reduced and is continuing to increase.</p>
<p>In the past five years, due to the pressure of grain dumping by international imperialism, grain prices across the country have been falling, which has affected land prices. Lingjiaqiao is no exception. However, the price of tea land has increased in the past five years. This is related to the increase in local tea sales and can be regarded as an exception in this area:</p>
<p>Price per Mu of Paddy Field Price per Mu of Tea Land</p>
<p>Current 5 Years Ago Current 5 Years Ago</p>
<p>Highest 90 Yuan 120 Yuan 90 Yuan 50 Yuan</p>
<p>Average 40 Yuan 80 Yuan 40 Yuan 25 Yuan</p>
<p>Lowest 10 Yuan 40 Yuan 10 Yuan 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Farmers regard tea land as the "rising star" of wealth generation. Despite the rising prices, ordinary farmers rarely sell it. At present, the sale and purchase of paddy fields is more common. With the decline in field prices, the trend of land concentration has not weakened slightly. A merchant in Lingjiaqiao has used the profits from his tea business to buy over thirty mu of fields from the farmers in this village in the past five or six years. Large landlords in the city, aware of the rising tide of farmer movements and the reduction of rents, want to sell their land, but in this day and age, hoping that farmers will buy the land is just a dream. Therefore, the landlord's attitude of regarding their land as worthless does not immediately reduce the seriousness of the land problem. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e78">Rumors of Public Debt Interest Rate Reduction and Postponement Spread Widely. Minister Kong Calls for Meeting with Financial Circles. General Manager Qian Xinzhi of the Four Banks Goes to Beijing to Meet Wu and Chen. Securities Trading as Usual Today, Regular Closure Tomorrow. <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that after the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations telegraphed the government to protect credit, Yu Zuoting, Jin Runyang, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, and others were summoned to Beijing by telegram from the Executive Yuan to inquire in person. After returning to Shanghai, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi called a meeting with leaders of the financial community the night before last. Qian Xinzhi, Deputy General Manager of the Four Banks Savings Association, went to Beijing the night before last. The Huashang Securities Exchange will open as usual today, with a regular closure from tomorrow onwards for the general closing period. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rumors of Interest Rate Reduction and Postponement</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, former Finance Minister Song Ziwen had consulted with holders of domestic bonds and agreed to slightly reduce the interest rate on the bonds and slightly postpone the repayment date to prevent the depletion of social finance. The National Government ordered the implementation on February 24th of the 21st year of the Republic of China. At that time, the monthly principal repayment fund for the bonds issued by the government was reduced from a total of 18 million yuan to 8.6 million yuan. Since its implementation, the monthly principal repayment fund has exceeded the previously stipulated amount due to the government's increased issuance of financial, customs, Yuping, and telecommunications bonds, totaling 11 million yuan. Recently, after rumors of the government reducing interest rates and postponing the repayment date of bonds spread in the market, all sectors attached great importance to them. Leaders of various organizations, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the financial community, and the Citizens' Federation, telegraphed the government one after another to protect bond credit. At the same time, Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and others were summoned to Beijing by telegram from the Executive Yuan to inquire in person. Although they have returned to Shanghai, securities trading on the Huashang Securities Exchange continues to plummet due to the unabated rumors in the market.</p>
<p>Verbatim Record of the Government Order of the 21st Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency verbatim recorded the order of the National Government on June 24th of the 21st year of the Republic of China as follows: "Since the Liaoning Incident, the prices of various bonds have plummeted as a result, and the national finances and social economy have suffered. The government has never been late in repaying principal and paying interest. When the Shanghai Incident followed, the bond market suddenly lost its liquidity, and finance was also stagnant. The government and the people are one, sharing weal and woe. At this time of national crisis and financial difficulties, rather than letting the bond market drift, it is better to slightly reduce interest rates and slightly postpone the repayment date to prevent the depletion of social finance. The financial resources to resist aggression can be slightly improved. Repeatedly decorate the example and re-propose appropriate standards. It has also been decided that 8.6 million yuan will be allocated from customs duties each month as a fund for allocating various bonds. The interest rate is 6% per annum, and the repayment period will be handled in accordance with the schedule drawn up by the Ministry of Finance. The relevant revenue officials and the General Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance shall be ordered to transfer the principal and interest of the various bonds in full and on schedule each month until the principal and interest are fully repaid, without any delay. This is the government's most decisive decision to maintain integrity and regulate finance with the people. Once the order is issued, it will be a permanent settlement. In the future, no matter how difficult the finances are, the aforementioned funds shall not be moved slightly, and there shall be no further changes to show great trust. This order."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Calls for Meeting with Financial Circles</p>
<p>After Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the morning before last, he convened a meeting with leaders of the financial community at his private residence on West Ahemes Road the night before last, including Song Hanzhang of the Bank of China, Tang Shoumin, General Manager of the Bank of Communications, Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, Qian Xinzhi, Deputy General Manager of the Four Banks Savings Association, Ye Zhuotang, General Manager of the Siming Bank, and Hu Bijiang, General Manager of the Zhongnan Bank. It is reported that the meeting was related to the rumors in the market about the government reducing interest rates and extending the repayment date. At the same time, Qian Xinzhi, Deputy General Manager of the Four Banks Savings Association, took the Shanghai-Nanjing night express train to Beijing the night before last to meet with Wu Daquan, Minister of Industry, and Chen Zheqing, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is reported that this matter is also related.</p>
<p>Securities Market Opens as Usual</p>
<p>Securities trading on the Huashang Securities Exchange has been consistently plummeting due to the market being filled with rumors of government interest rate reductions and postponements, causing all bonds to fall across the board. The previous day, military cuts and rehabilitation fell to four yuan and trading was suspended. Yesterday was a regular weekly closure. Today, Monday, it will open as usual. Also, because the general closing period for various industries in the 24th year of the Republic of China has arrived, it has been decided that from tomorrow (the 21st), the market will be closed in accordance with previous years' practices until the general closing is over.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports that the Central Mint has been ordered to mint decimal subsidiary coins. After the regulations were passed by the Legislative Yuan, the mint is now casting two types: copper one fen and nickel five fen. Once a certain number have been minted and the weight is verified to be legal, they can be circulated on the market. The five-fen subsidiary coin is round in shape. The front features a profile portrait of the Premier, inscribed with the words "Made in the 25th Year of the Republic of China." The reverse side has a currency cloth model in the middle, with the words "Five Fen" on the left and right. Both sides are surrounded by a meander pattern. The total weight is three grams.

<h3 id="e86">Silk Factories Completely Shut Down. Workers Cling to Old Habits and Return Home for the New Year. Various Silk Merchants All Earned Huge Profits Last Year. <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>After the overseas sales of Chinese silk improved, prices soared, and exports increased significantly. Silk merchants from various factories all earned huge profits. However, due to the lack of raw materials, silk factories in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang were forced to shut down one after another. They will resume operation after the spring cocoons are on the market. Silk factories in Shanghai have temporarily shut down due to the arrival of the general closing period for various industries in the 24th year and the silk reeling workers clinging to their old habits and returning home for the New Year. For example, Fulunheng Shuanggong Factory and others on Tianbao Road have already shut down yesterday and will resume operation after the 27th of this month. However, it is expected that all silk factories will inevitably stop operating due to the lack of raw materials to reel when the spring cocoons are about to be on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Industry Ministry's Silk Relief Plan: Three Major Initiatives Proposed <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to the Hua Dong News Agency, the United States has traditionally been the largest importer of Chinese silk, with exports to the U.S. reaching over 30 million yuan last year. France and England are second, but in recent years, due to the dumping of artificial silk by Japan and Italy, the position of Chinese silk has plummeted. Last year, after the "International Raw Silk Trade Conference," uniform standards of quality and pricing were implemented under the repeated supervision of the authorities, finally gaining the trust of foreign merchants. Now, to facilitate sales, the Ministry of Industry has planned to establish Chinese raw silk promotion offices in New York, Paris, Marseille, and London. These offices are expected to be operational by the summer of this year.</p>
<p>Improving Silkworm Breeds: The Ministry of Industry believes that in addition to dumping, poor silk quality is a major factor affecting silk exports. Therefore, this year, it has decided to work with the National Economic Council and the Silkworm Breed Improvement Committee to actively improve silkworm breeds. Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have already started their own programs. It is expected that preparations will be completed by March and the improved breeds will be distributed to various counties for application. In addition, silkworm breeds will be purchased from foreign countries. It is reported that the Silkworm Association has confirmed the improvement of 1.5 million sheets of improved silkworm eggs, and currently has 2 million sheets.</p>
<p>Standardizing Brands: Last year, raw silk prices rose sharply abroad, resulting in considerable profits for silk mills. However, there were occasional factory shutdowns, with some mills deliberately halting production. It is estimated that there are currently over 80,000 bales of silk in storage, which can sustain production until the new silkworms come on the market. According to research by the Ministry of Industry, the failure of Chinese silk has many causes, but the lack of standardized brands and pricing is the most detrimental factor. Recently, old-style silk mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou and other cities have machinery that is three or four decades old. If these are not urgently improved, they will be eliminated by the times. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry suggests that factories use their profits to purchase new machinery, working together to overcome the challenges facing the silk industry.</p>

<p>Since its opening on New Year's Day, the Shanghai Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association has specified its key tasks for this year. It has also sent a letter to the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau, requesting that national goods raw materials be used in the manufacture of Party and National Flags. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Key Tasks</p>
<p>The key tasks for this year include: pasting slogans throughout the city to promote the concept of citizens using national goods; holding mobile national goods exhibitions in the five districts of Shanghai (East, South, West, North, and Central); organizing five national goods promotion teams, each with ten members, to promote national goods in Shanghai and other locations; inviting prominent figures from the Party, government, business, academic, agricultural, and industrial sectors to broadcast on the radio weekly; having staff members inspect the performance of various stores in promoting national goods in Shanghai; holding national goods promotion meetings in Shanghai once a month; having staff members investigate the production and economic conditions of national goods factories in Shanghai; organizing five national goods lecture teams, each with six members, to give lectures in Shanghai and other locations; publishing national goods publications; and conducting national goods statistics.</p>
<p>Using National Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau requesting the use of national goods raw materials, stating: "The national emblem is the most solemn symbol of a country, and the most important symbol of a nation. Therefore, to maintain national dignity, the raw materials used to manufacture national flags must be entirely national goods, so as not to undermine the nation's system. Now that your bureau has been established to standardize the size and specifications of flag manufacture, we are deeply impressed by your thorough planning. However, current production should prioritize the use of national goods raw materials. In order to respect the national emblem, our association has resolved in a board meeting to send a letter to the Party and National Flag Manufacturing Bureau asking what raw materials are currently used in manufacturing, and requesting a sample of the Party and National Flag for our inspection." This has been recorded. This matter concerns the promotion of national goods, and we hope you will strive to promote them in order to honor the nation and benefit sales. We are sending this record for your reference. We hope to receive a reply."</p>

<p>Extended Inspection in the South Shanghai District; Inspections to be Held in Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Pudong</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, factory fire prevention and the safety of each factory are extremely important. The municipal authorities have always paid attention to this. In order to further improve the fire prevention equipment of various factories, the Municipal Public Security Bureau began inspection work in July last year, dispatching personnel to actively inspect each factory. If improvements were urgently needed, the factories were immediately ordered to correct them, install fire extinguishers, and provide instructions to avoid fire hazards. Since its implementation, the results have been very remarkable. The work is carried out by district. The inspection in the South Shanghai District has been going on for a long time. However, because there are many areas that need to be improved in the various factories, it has been extended slightly and inspections continue, with the aim of ensuring that all factories can make corrections voluntarily. According to the person in charge of the Fire Prevention Section of the Bureau, after the inspection in the South Shanghai District is completed, the three districts of Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Pudong will continue to start at a later date. The inspection date for each district has not yet been determined, and will depend on the results of the inspection. The Bureau believes that factory fire prevention is related to the happiness of all workers in the city, and is also closely related to public safety. Therefore, the inspection cannot be carried out carelessly, and the date must be extended slightly.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Salary Cuts for Staff of Various Bureaus Due to Municipal Government's Austerity Measures <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Government has been experiencing empty coffers and a budget deficit in recent years. Therefore, starting in December of the 24th year, the regular expenses of all subordinate agencies have been paid at 80% of the original amount. Now, various bureaus are implementing major austerity measures, including layoffs and salary cuts. Except for staff with salaries below 50 yuan, who are exempt from the discount, all bureaus issue salaries at 80% to 90% of the original amount. The Social Affairs Bureau has larger expenses, so the salaries of its staff have already been discounted by 5% since July of last year, and have been further reduced since December, resulting in a significant shortfall. Therefore, it is proposed that the salaries of staff be uniformly paid at 76% of the original amount. However, low-level staff with salaries below 50 yuan have difficult lives and are at risk of going hungry if their salaries are discounted. Therefore, Director Wu, out of consideration, has decided to find ways to maintain their original salaries.</p>

<p>Slaughtering Industry Stops Taking Slaughtered Pigs</p>
<p>A total of 24 slaughtering companies in the Nanshi area have all stopped taking slaughtered piglets from Nanshi pig trade warehouses starting yesterday. The counterparts in the concession areas were informed too late, so they are still taking goods from Nanshi. It is estimated that they will all stop taking goods today. The counterparts of the association in Zhabei take goods from Wusong, because the fresh pig industry in Wusong is well managed and there is no malpractice of forcibly plucking pig bristles.</p>
<p>Vendors Association Petitions for Relief</p>
<p>After the slaughtering industry stopped taking goods, the Fresh Pig Trade Association and the Fresh Meat Industry Association have not yet made any statements.

<h3 id="e117">Jiangnan Chemical Industrial Plant Creates Domestically Produced Bleaching Powder, Capital Increase of 100,000 Yuan Fully Subscribed <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangnan Chemical Industrial Plant, located on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, was the first acetic acid plant in the East. It was established in 1933 by Xu Shixing and Ge Guiye, using wood as raw material. By 1934, it was fully operational, producing high-quality products that were favored by many domestic factories. However, production was too small to meet demand. Leading merchants such as Shen Zhongyi, Zhang Rongchu, Zhu Luquan, Fei Liangsheng, Zhou Lianbu, and Zhao Shichun invested to expand and reorganize the plant. Dr. Xue Jimin was hired as the chief engineer. Xue, with his ingenuity, built four dry distillation stoves himself. Other equipment, such as tar machines, wood alcohol machines, and drying machines, were also designed and built in-house, achieving remarkable results. Each day, 400 dan of firewood were used to produce over 3,000 pounds of high-quality acetic acid. The plant also produced many by-products, such as carbolic acid, turpentine, refined wood alcohol, and medicine for lung diseases. The raw materials were only three: firewood, lime, and sulfuric acid, making it a purely domestic product. Recently, Dr. Xue, after further research, discovered that adding salt would produce high-quality bleaching powder. The required equipment, in addition to the existing generator, only needed new-style electrolytic cells. This would be highly efficient, achieving two goals at once. The plant authorities have already ordered various necessary machines from famous European and American factories. The new project is expected to be completed between May and June, and production will begin then. A decision was also made to increase capital by 100,000 yuan to strengthen the plant's financial position. The shares were subscribed by the shareholders, and it is said that the full amount has been raised. This is truly good news for China's industrial sector.</p>

<p>The world is going downhill, and scams are becoming more ingenious.

<p>The military government's transportation corps plans to switch entirely to charcoal-fueled vehicles. A special commissioner has been dispatched to Shanghai to test the vehicles. Three companies are participating in the trial: Zhongming Machinery Company, China Coal Gas Company, and Chinese Coal Gas Company. They departed from Shanghai the other day, first to Hangzhou and then back to Nanjing, to determine which is superior. As a result, Zhongming arrived in Hangzhou first, followed by China five minutes later, and then Chinese thirty minutes later. This shows that the use of charcoal vehicles is becoming increasingly widespread today.</p>

<p>Riri News reports that yesterday, the China branch of the International Labor Bureau released a report on the situation of overseas Chinese in Vladivostok. According to a survey by the local consulate general: The Soviet government has no immigration regulations and treats overseas Chinese equally with its own citizens, with no special provisions. There are a total of 23,800 overseas Chinese in Vladivostok city and the coastal Ussuri region under the consulate's jurisdiction. Since the Soviet Union implemented state-owned industries and commerce, all foreign businesses have been completely eliminated. Therefore, with the exception of a few property owners and property agents, all overseas Chinese in the Soviet Union are laborers. They work eight or seven hours a day, with one day off every six days. Their monthly income ranges from 100 to 300 rubles, while their monthly expenses range from 150 to 250 rubles. The cost of living in the area is high. Only those with skills have higher incomes and can barely manage. Most others have difficulty making ends meet, and their lives are difficult. Furthermore, Soviet law prohibits the export of domestic currency. Therefore, the income earned by foreigners can only be used within the Soviet Union and cannot be remitted to support families. When leaving the Soviet Union to return home, they cannot take the currency with them.</p>

<p>In order to maintain public order and provide relief to vagrant beggars in the city, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has drafted a plan to thoroughly address the issue and will begin implementation immediately. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures to Provide Rescue and Steps to Take</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau recognizes that due to the natural and man-made disasters of the past year, rural areas have become bankrupt, the economy has declined, and many refugees have been unable to make a living, resulting in a large influx of refugees into Shanghai. Shanghai is a mixed Chinese and foreign settlement, with a dense population, developed transportation, and public order that must be maintained. Many refugees, after arriving in Shanghai, gather at wharves and train stations, stealing travelers' belongings to make a living, or engage in illegal and criminal activities throughout the city. In order to maintain public order and thoroughly provide relief, the bureau has decided to implement a beggar relief plan, to be carried out in January, February, and March, with the head of the relief division, Yin Guanzhi, responsible for overseeing everything. According to the division head, speaking to a reporter from Xin Sheng News, the plan has been approved by Director Cai and will begin implementation soon. The steps to be taken are as follows: In January, consult with various charitable organizations to discuss relief measures and issue orders to subordinates to implement the regulations. In February, investigate the number of people receiving relief and conduct inspections at important locations. In March, continue to investigate the number of people receiving relief and conduct inspections at important locations, and compile statistics.</p>
<p>Decisions Made and Implementation to Begin Immediately</p>
<p>The bureau has decided on a comprehensive relief plan for vagrant beggars, as follows: Consult with various charitable organizations in the city (such as the Hubei Nanbihan Shelter, the Unemployed Training Center, the Civilian Education Center, and the Women's Temperance Association, etc.) to discuss effective ways to provide relief to vagrant beggars and establish close cooperation. Issue orders to subordinates to begin arresting beggars immediately. Male beggars should be sent to the Hubei Nanbihan Shelter, while female beggars should be sent to the Women's Temperance Association for education. Those who voluntarily wish to return home, regardless of gender, should be reported to the bureau at any time, which will consult with charitable organizations to arrange their return to their hometowns. Beggars with extremely poor character who are deemed irredeemable may be sent to the Unemployed Training Center or the Civilian Education Center for compulsory accommodation and education. Personnel will be dispatched at any time to inspect important transportation locations.</p>

This was done to keep a close eye on protection at any time and to plan unified relief. The completion of registration was limited to four months and at the latest, not to exceed six months. The measures stipulate that employers should appropriately pay those under 16 years of age and must not mistreat them. If they are over 16 years of age, the employer shall consult with the person concerned to select a marriage or send them to a local charitable institution for relief. If concealment or mistreatment is discovered within the registration period, the public security organs may punish them at any time or send them to the court for prosecution. Since receiving this order, the Municipal Public Security Bureau is currently considering and drafting detailed measures. Once the drafting is completed, it will be submitted to the municipal government for approval and registration will begin, in early next month.</p>

<p>At 2:30 AM yesterday, a detective from the French Concession Foch Police Station, number 103, was on patrol when he discovered an abandoned rush bag by the side of the road in front of number 12 Henry Road. The bag was neatly wrapped, arousing suspicion. The detective immediately went forward, untied the bag, and opened it for inspection. To his shock, he found a child's head inside. He was terrified and immediately reported it to the Foch Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate. It seemed that the child had died of illness and was then decapitated. Judging by the child's appearance, he/she was less than one year old, only a few months old. There were slight traces of blood where the head was cut off. The gender could not be determined, but the body was nowhere to be found, and it was unknown where it had been buried or discarded. The detectives reported the information to the head detective, who notified the Tongren Funeral Home to send workers to take the body to the mortuary for examination. Today, the matter will be reported to the Second Special District Court for officials to conduct an examination. Meanwhile, the police station has ordered all detectives to investigate and arrest the person who abandoned the body and bring them to justice. According to general speculation, the parents of the deceased child believed that the child would not grow up and was a "debt-collecting ghost." Hence, they resorted to this cruel measure to prevent the dead ghost from being reborn in the future, so that subsequent children could grow up safely. This superstitious act is truly ridiculous.</p>

<p>Since its founding by Minister Kong and others, the Chinese Child Welfare Association has been working with the government to promote child welfare, which has attracted the attention of people in the country. The association has also been working hard to establish close ties with child welfare organizations in the United Kingdom and the United States, without discrimination based on race or nationality. Therefore, when the Chinese Child Welfare Association held its annual meeting, the American Child Welfare Association also sent a representative, Mrs. Roberts, to China to attend and to investigate the general situation of child welfare in China. After arriving in China, Mrs. Roberts met with the president of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, Kong Xiangxi, and his wife, and expressed her willingness to donate 80,000 yuan in the name of the American Association to establish a Nanjing Child Welfare Experimental Zone in the capital to carry out various child welfare initiatives. Mrs. Roberts stated that this matter has been agreed upon, and the American Child Welfare Association will remit the funds soon in preparation for working with the Chinese Child Welfare Association to prepare everything. It is expected to be realized this year. Once the experimental zone is established, it will still be managed by the Chinese Child Welfare Association and will apply to the Chinese government for annual funding in order to promote various important tasks and benefit children in China who are deprived of education and care. However, the 80,000 yuan provided by the American Association is only a foundation fund.</p>

Lu was tied with ropes and left to sleep on the drying rack overnight. After the incident came to light, Detective Su Jiyu of the Hongkou Police Station arrested Liu Shaozhang and sent him to the First Special District Court, where he was released on 500 yuan bail. Tan, who was working as a nurse at the Shanghai Sanatorium Hospital on Laobazi Road, had not arrived yet. Yesterday, she and her lawyer, Yue Junying, surrendered to the police station with her husband, Shaozhang, to face the Third Criminal Court. Cuiying and Lu Yue were temporarily held at the Jiliang Institute and also appeared in court at the time. After Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned the two defendants, he ruled that Liu Shaozhang would be sentenced to six months in prison, suspended for three years, and Liu Tan would be fined 200 yuan, suspended for two years. Cuiying and Lu Yue were taken back and must not be abused again. During the probation period, they are both to be placed under the supervision of the local police station.</p>

<p>Xiang Yixing, the owner of the Xingchang Iron Factory at 151 Ou Jia Road, from Ningbo, was kidnapped on July 20th of last year at his ancestral hall on Gonghe Road, Zhabei, and a large ransom was demanded. He was rescued by the local Public Security Bureau. However, between October 13th and January 6th of this year, he received more than ten threatening letters from the gang, demanding 80,000 yuan. Xiang reported this to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, and Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, Detective Liu Shaokui, and Detective Qian Xianzhang of the General Inspection Office arrested four suspects, Wang Jinzhang from Pudong, Zhang Guangen, Gong Agen, and Wei Youliang from Chongming, at room 16 of the Jiaotong Hotel at 37, Lane 117, Shandong Road. They were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, Judge Xiao changed to Cai to continue the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer of the Municipal Council, stated that since the adjournment, the victim Xiang had received another letter from the gang, stating that they must pay at least 10,000 yuan and that they would send someone to negotiate at a certain location on Badang Road in the French Concession; otherwise, they would take drastic measures. Given this situation, in addition to the four defendants, there are still many accomplices. He requested an extension of the investigation. Chang presented the letter and asked the defendants for an explanation. They confessed that a man named Xue Shandong, who is still at large, had initiated the plan. After deliberation, the court ordered them to be returned to custody and postponed the hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>At 4:20 PM yesterday, Zhu Shizhen, a traffic police officer stationed at the intersection of Heping Road, was directing traffic when four rickshaws carrying one man and four women from north to south arrived at the intersection. The rickshaw pullers, without displaying their police badges, attempted to make a small turn illegally. Officer Zhu Baozhen went forward to direct the pullers when a passenger in plain clothes got out of one of the rickshaws and started arguing with the officer. Without asking for any explanation, he slapped the officer twice, causing his hat to fall off, and claimed, "I am an inspector, what's wrong with hitting you?" At that time, the pedestrians on the road protested. At the same time, a machine gun squad police officer, Mao Biao, a traffic police officer from Wenchao Road Police Station, Zhang Linfu, and an officer from the Ximen Police Station arrived. Officer Zhu Baozhen was reporting the above incident when the so-called inspector snatched his baton and struck him again, breaking his right eye socket and causing him to bleed profusely. The officers and inspectors present in the branch office witnessed this. All the officers in the branch office were dissatisfied and demanded that the branch chief send both parties to the General Bureau for legal proceedings. It was also learned that the so-called inspector was Yin Xueren, who is currently serving as an inspector at the Mongol Road Police Station in Zhabei. He had taken leave to go to Nanshi with his wife and family. As a result, the pedestrians in front of the Ximen Police Station were crowded and unwilling to disperse. Later, Director Yao sent the inspector and the traffic police officer together to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

On December 20th of last year, at around 4:00 PM, Ada suddenly went missing. Later, a neighbor's daughter reported that he had been taken away by Hou Lin'an, a native of Changzhou whom they knew. She immediately reported it to the French Concession police, but they were unable to investigate. It wasn't until the 4th of this month that a tenant living with the Ni family happened to get off the tram at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Haining Road and saw Hou seemingly heading to a public bathhouse. So, she devised a plan to lure Hou to the Ni family's house and handed him over to the police for interrogation. Hou then admitted to the kidnapping and fraud, and that the child was hidden in the Aihua Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. The head constable immediately dispatched Detective Wu Yuren to retrieve the child and return him to his family. Hou was then handed over to the Special Second Court, and the police department filed a public prosecution according to the law. The details of the trial have been reported in previous issues. After the trial by Judge Xiong of the Special Second Court, Hou Lin'an was sentenced on the afternoon of the other day to four years of imprisonment for enticing a man under the age of twenty to leave his family.

Both Bi and Xu were suffocated by the gas. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a female servant knocked on the door, but there was no response. She opened the door and saw that Bi was already dead.

<h3 id="e146">Hunan Nanxian, China Inland Mission Begs for Disaster Relief for Sanxian Lake <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on Renji Road, in view of the Yangtze River flood disaster, which has spread across several provinces, and the limited cotton relief efforts, has long been jointly working with the World Red Swastika Society, Jisheng Society, etc., hoping to achieve the goal of universal relief. For Hunan Province, they will first address the most urgent needs and have allocated funds to Director Lu Junbohong of the Shanxi board to select areas for distribution. However, due to the vast area and severe disaster, the funds are felt to be insufficient. Now, the association has also received a plea from Pastor Sheng Cheng of the China Inland Mission Gospel Church in Nanxian, Hunan, for Sanxian Lake. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "Respected Sirs, Sanxian Lake is a prosperous town in Nanxian, located in the fourth district of Nanxian. The fourth district consists of more than thirty settlements, including Tiancheng, Jixian, and Laoyan, and is the largest area in the entire county. In the 20th year of the Republic of China [1931], it suffered an unprecedented flood, with everything submerged. In the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd years [1932-1934], although the main embankment did not collapse, those within the courtyard that collapsed and produced nothing accounted for nearly one-third. Unexpectedly, in the 24th year [1935], there was again continuous spring rain, and continuous summer rain. The Xiang, Zi, Huan, and Feng rivers simultaneously burst, reaching a water level one foot higher than in the 20th year, turning everything into a watery land. Pitiful farmers, many of whom drowned. Homes, agricultural tools, etc., were all washed away. The embankments are in danger with the sound of crying filling the air. Although the disaster situation is severe, the Hunan government has provided emergency relief by distributing porridge and providing funds to send the disaster victims away. Due to the severity of the disaster and the shortage of funds, the relief work was soon suspended. Temporary work loans were also issued, and late rice and miscellaneous grains were planted. However, due to the autumn flood, the water submerged and the wind destroyed them. High-field white rice accounted for the majority, with very little harvest. Low-lying fields were completely submerged, and the even lower fields are still submerged to this day. In this harsh winter, with ice and snow everywhere, the wailing disaster victims are fighting for nameless vegetable leaves to barely survive. Some are suffering from hunger and cold, and are on the verge of starvation. Some are displaced and their whereabouts are unknown. The misery of these disaster victims is beyond words. If we do not seek urgent relief, starvation is inevitable. Therefore, we are making a special report on the disaster situation and earnestly requesting that personnel be dispatched to conduct an on-site survey and widely distribute disaster relief funds to save the disaster victims."</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to all amusement parks yesterday, stating: "It has been found that various amusement parks have facilities such as X or SY. If they do not violate the bureau's regulations on the review of operas and records, this Bureau could refrain from further investigating. However, it has been found that some amusement parks are using women who are completely naked as a draw. This kind of behavior, which spares no effort to harm young people and seeks only profit, is highly inappropriate. This is a special notice to all. Hereafter, the appearance of nudity is not allowed. Furthermore, hula dances and 'New Spider Cave' performances are all performances that harm morality and have been repeatedly strictly prohibited by this bureau. Currently, a small number of amusement parks still dare to outwardly comply but inwardly resist, or cleverly change their names, which is illegal. It is hereby reiterated that these prohibitions are in effect. If anyone dares to deliberately violate them again, they will be severely punished without leniency. This order."</p>

<h3 id="e148">Chen Kaiqing's Rough Stone Case: Appeal to the Administrative Court Based on the Principle of Not Punishing Twice for the Same Offense <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Request to revoke the original confiscation order. The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Fujianese merchant Chen Kaiqing, due to the rough stones he was transporting being deemed underpriced by the Jianghai Customs, was fined after a separate valuation. While the stones were being processed, they were again seized and confiscated by the Jianghai Customs. The merchant, based on the principle of not punishing twice for the same offense, raised an objection according to Article 31 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations. This objection was overruled by the Penalty Review Committee, which upheld the original order. The merchant, feeling that being punished twice for the same offense was unacceptable, filed an appeal to the Administrative Court according to Article 32 of the Anti-Smuggling Regulations. The statement of appeal is as follows: (A) Facts and History of the Case:</p>
<p>Payment of Tax and Fine: The plaintiff, on April 22nd of this year, transported a piece of rough stone from Burma. He declared the original price to the Jianghai Customs and submitted all relevant documents for inspection (in addition to invoices and other documents, there was also a tax receipt from Burma, which is referred to as the tax bill in this case). The Customs deemed all documents submitted by the plaintiff unreliable and independently valued the stone at 2,000 Rupees, equivalent to 1,234.58 Gold Standard Units. They then considered this a violation of customs regulations (specifically Article 22 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations) and ordered the plaintiff to pay a fine of 600 National Currency Units in addition to the tax based on the assessed value. At the time, the plaintiff was eager to take delivery of the goods for sale and immediately paid the full amount, holding receipts for both the tax and the fine issued by the Customs. He then took possession of the stone.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Second Seizure: Later, the stone was taken for trial processing in order to sell it at a good price. Unexpectedly, upon trial processing, it was found that the quality of the materials inside was quite excellent, and therefore the plaintiff was unwilling to sell it cheaply. This aroused the jealousy of competitors, and a person named Lu Zhongyi falsely accused the plaintiff to the Customs, resulting in the Customs repossessing and detaining the stone on May 22nd. Despite explanations of the tax payment and fine, the Customs ignored them. At that time, the Customs did not follow the legal procedures and illegally took the stone away without authorization. The plaintiff, fearing the authority, did nothing about it.</p>
<p>Negotiations and Penalties: Subsequently, the plaintiff repeatedly went to the Customs to negotiate, only obtaining a receipt for the detained goods. He repeatedly requested its return, but was told that he must first admit his mistake (without specifying how to admit it). The plaintiff, considering his previous penalty, was unwilling to do so, leading to a stalemate. Seeing that they were unreasonable, the plaintiff repeatedly explained the facts and reasons to the Inspector General of Customs and the Directorate General of Customs, repeatedly requesting legal intervention, but to no avail. Finally, on June 18th of this year, the Inspector General of Customs sent a letter stating that the case was under investigation. Believing that the case was simple and did not require investigation, and fearing that this was a tactic to delay the matter, the plaintiff immediately raised an objection, but it was ignored. On July 18th, another letter from the Inspector General of Customs stated that the case had been submitted to the Directorate General of Customs for review, but no instructions were received from the Directorate General of Customs. Knowing that he was powerless, the plaintiff entrusted the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward the matter with a factual account, but there was no reply. It was not until October 3rd that a letter was received from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, enclosing a copy of the Inspector General of Customs' document No. 7935, in which the Customs stated how the plaintiff had committed fraud, etc. While the plaintiff was still astonished, on October 8th, the Customs personally delivered a penalty order, which stated the penalties:</p>
<p>*   A fine of 15,000 National Currency Units.</p>
<p>*   The jade stone is confiscated, but the owner is allowed to repurchase it at an assessed value of 50,000 Yuan.</p>
<p>*   Supplementary import tax is to be paid according to the assessed value of 50,000 Yuan. The reasons for the alleged violation of customs regulations were only the eight characters "submitted fake documents, underreported value," which is exactly the same as the content in Article 22 of the Anti-Smuggling Regulations and the same as the previous penalty.</p>
<p>Review and Decision: The plaintiff, feeling that the reasons given in the order were brief and lacking in detail, making it difficult to defend himself, immediately declared an objection on October 12th in accordance with the law and requested a detailed explanation of the reasons. The reply stated that the penalty in this case had been approved by the Directorate General of Customs, and if the plaintiff was not satisfied, he should file an administrative lawsuit, but the reasons for the penalty were still not explained. Fearing that he would miss the legal deadline, the plaintiff immediately prepared a statement of objection on October 18th, based on the Inspector General of Customs' document No. 7935, and submitted it to the Customs for review. However, on October 21st, the original statement was returned with instructions to proceed as before. The plaintiff, feeling that it was inappropriate to appeal beyond the proper channels, again cited legal examples and submitted it to the Customs for correction, but the Customs remained unenlightened and instead blamed the plaintiff for misunderstanding. At this point, the plaintiff was truly helpless. Just as he was about to file an administrative lawsuit, he suddenly received an order from the Directorate General of Customs on November 1st, pending review by the Penalty Review Committee. At the same time, he received a letter from the Customs asking him to submit additional reasons for the objection. The plaintiff, wanting to resolve the matter quickly, immediately submitted three copies of the prepared statement of objection to the Customs for review the following day. Afterwards, he repeatedly urged them, and after more than a month, on December 12th of this month, he received the decision of the Directorate General of Customs to uphold the original order. Looking at the inconsistencies and illegal actions of the defendants in the procedural aspects of this case, it is truly unbearable for the plaintiff. Therefore, according to Article 32 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations, the plaintiff has filed this lawsuit with your court, requesting relief. (B) Reasons for Disagreeing with the Order and the Decision:</p>
<p>Regarding the order from the first defendant, the Jianghai Customs Tax Office, it only contained the main text and did not provide any reasons, so the plaintiff cannot fathom the reasons for the order and cannot refute them. Here are the points to refute the reasons for the decision of the Penalty Review Committee of the second defendant, the Directorate General of Customs:</p>
<p>Regarding the first item of the review opinions, the principle of "res judicata" (a matter already judged) is a major principle of the rule of law. How can customs penalties be an exception? The provisions of Article 30 of the Customs Anti-Smuggling Regulations refer to the subsequent discovery of undeclared goods that have not been penalized beforehand. If a penalty has already been imposed, the provisions of that article do not apply. The original decision intentionally distorts the text, which is outrageous. The decision also states that "the Customs' first decision to punish the merchant was due to underreporting the value of the goods, while the second decision to punish and confiscate the goods was due to the discovery that the tax bill did not belong to the rough stone in this case." This argument is very sophistical. Does the original order not state that the rule violated by the plaintiff was "submitted fake documents, underreported value"? Therefore, the first penalty is for the same reason and the same act as the second penalty and confiscation. This is the first disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the second item of the review opinions, it is stated that "it has long been verified that the tax bill for the rough stone in Burma is taxed at 33.33%, and the tax amount is also clearly stated as 200 Rupees, which can infer that the value of the stone in Burma should be 600 Rupees." It is also stated that "using the tax bill as the valuation standard, the amount stated on it is one-tenth of the price of the stone on board," and "the tax amount of 200 Rupees, multiplied by ten, is 2,000 Rupees, plus the cost of landing and taxes, should be converted to 1,234.58 Gold Standard Units." Based on the above valuation method, anyone would know that it is unreasonable. Saying that it is not based on the tax bill for valuation is certainly credible. It is also stated that "the invoice shows 825 Rupees, which is considered the price on board, so it is equal to the tax bill." If the invoice states this, and the Customs values it like that, then is the submitted invoice not already recognized as fake? That is, there is no need to discuss how to value it, as it has already been considered that there is a situation of submitting fake documents. Why wait until it is discovered that the tax bill does not belong to the rough stone in this case to determine that the plaintiff submitted fake documents? As for the odd amounts, since the Customs themselves stated that it is based on calculation methods, then even if it is odd, it is actually rounded. The terms "one-tenth" and "multiplied by ten" are intended to force a match, but instead expose their own flaws. The committee still forcefully defends it, but where is the so-called "sufficient reason"? This is also disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the third, fourth, and fifth items of the review opinions, according to the principle of "res judicata," even if someone reports, the past situation should be checked first, and then it should be decided whether to accept it or not. One should not rashly detain it, causing unnecessary losses to others. If this example is set, all import merchants in the city will have the risk of having their goods detained at any time, and there will be no peace. Is this the original intention of setting up customs and collecting taxes? The so-called disclosure of the name of the reporter and the reported facts is intended to thoroughly investigate and see the truth of the case. According to the Inspector General of Customs' document No. 7935, it is based on hearsay, Lu Zhongyi's report, described vividly and definitively. After the plaintiff refuted it fully in the statement of reasons for disagreeing with the order, the original decision stated that the Customs' order was not based on this, which clearly shows that the original decision is a castle in the air with no basis. This is the third disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the sixth item of the review opinions, regarding the so-called value problem, the Customs never mentioned the so-called inviting valuation in the original report, only stating that someone came to the Customs for unofficial contact to purchase it. Now, it is said that it is handled according to the regulations, and one of the people is said to be an arbitrary addition. Whether the regulations cited are applicable or whether there was actually a valuation, even if there was, the price estimated in the first decision is absolutely insufficient to be used as a basis, and there is even less reason to say that there is tax evasion and confiscation. Because the thing about rough stones is that before it is trial processed, its appearance is like ordinary rock and has no value. Only after trial processing (commonly known as opening the eye) can a rough estimate be made, and only after complete processing can a more accurate valuation be made. It still needs to be priced by people according to the time after it is processed into utensils. The truth in this is not enough for outsiders to say. Therefore, the valuation after trial processing, even if it is hundreds or thousands of times the original purchase price, or even worthless, is a common occurrence, similar to speculative business. Now, if the second decision estimates the value at 50,000, and in the future it will be 100,000 or 200,000, and then the valuation is followed in sequence, and penalties are imposed in turn, is there such a reason in the world? The committee did not know the truth, but only thought about ordinary things. It is not surprising that their understanding is insufficient, but at the beginning when the stone was detained, the truth was briefly stated to the Directorate General of Customs. Why is it so forgetful? Moreover, the method of appraisal of goods by the public must be done by hiring experts in a public way and must never be done by the Customs in a secretive way. This is the fourth disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the seventh item of the review opinions, whether there is a Baozhen Company mark on the stone is a major question. Since the committee examined it and said that it was clearly visible and obvious to the eye, the plaintiff cannot say that it is certainly not there. But how does the committee know for sure that the rough stone they saw is the rough stone in this case? How do they know for sure that the mark they saw is the actual mark placed by the company? Whether the ink color is new or old, please have an expert appraise it. Also, why was the plaintiff not present at the time of the examination? And the plaintiff has repeatedly requested to see the stone, why was it rejected? All this makes the plaintiff very suspicious. Also, when the Customs detained the stone, they did not follow the legal procedures, neither issuing a formal receipt nor noting the characteristics of the stone on any record. The plaintiff has been touching the stone day and night, and has never seen the Baozhen Company mark. Now the Customs suddenly discovers the mark. Therefore, regarding the authenticity of the mark and whether the mark existed before the detention, the Customs has the responsibility to provide evidence. The plaintiff still has the following points of defense regarding this item:</p>
<p>The stone has been detained for a long time and anything can be done. The stone has been detained at the Customs for more than half a year, and it is easy to add crimes and do whatever they want. The mark on the stone is only a sign for the tax merchant and does not have any external duties, so all use Chinese ink, which can be washed off and will not be permanently preserved. Now the mark they see has not been proven to be the company's true mark, nor has the ink been inspected. And according to the Customs' investigation, the so-called Zhang Bao and others have been dead for several years, so no one can come out to acknowledge it. How do they know that it was not added later? Why did the committee not see this?</p>
<p>Deliberately inspected, but nothing was seen. According to the mark seen by the committee, it is very visible and obvious to the eye. Then, when the Customs inspected and valued it, even after repeated and detailed viewing, why didn't they see it? It is said that recently the rough stones declared to customs all have marks on them. Stones have not started today, and marks have long been seen. And since they have been priced based on the documents for a long time, the relationship between the documents, goods, and stamps should have been well known. Therefore, the inspection at the time was a clear sign of comparison between the documents and goods. How could it not be discovered such a clearly visible mark? Now it suddenly appears, which is strange.</p>
<p>The handling process is incredible. After the stone was detained, the plaintiff went to the Customs to negotiate many times, but the Customs never mentioned the discovery of the mark, nor did they ask the plaintiff to acknowledge it. And according to the original report, because this mark was discovered, the Burmese government was investigated, and the government's reply telegram was received in June. Why couldn't it be announced and judged directly, but had to be reviewed and handled for several months? The actions of the anti-smuggling department are incredible, probably because there is no supporting evidence and they are shirking responsibility.</p>
<p>It is not possible to replace the goods. Rough stone is a natural product and is not man-made. The size and weight are different and cannot be changed. If it is suspected of being replaced, the tax bill clearly lists the weight, about 640 Chinese pounds, which was verified by the Customs at the time of valuation and found to be correct. Since the weight of the stone cannot be changed, how can it be so coincidental to replace it? Now, instead of thinking about this, they discovered a mark and then inquired about it from people thousands of miles away, which is abandoning the near and seeking the far, and the intention is unknown.</p>
<p>There are three marks on one side, which is very strange. There are no rules for tax merchants to stamp, only for easy identification. To be identified, it should be stamped on the front where it is easy to see. Now there are as many as three on the side, and all other parts are completely absent. Instead of stamping the mark on the front, which is convenient for stamping, three are stamped on the side, which is very strange. If all the others have been erased and nothing remains, then why are these three left, and they are very visible? Is it not strange? If the final suspicion is the truth, then it is just a case of overreaching.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to chemically test the age of the ink. The part of the photos taken is extremely small, and it cannot be determined that it is not the rough stone in this case. The marks taken cannot be concluded to be fake. Comparing the other photos attached, the degree of visibility is almost the same. However, the mark stamped ten years ago is as clear as the one recently stamped. Even the most stupid people cannot believe it. Although it is not difficult to test the age of the ink by chemical methods, due to the prestige of the country, no one can but maintain the dignity of the customs and give a fair judgment. The Customs may have seen this, so they rashly made a statement, and they did not dare to ask for an inspection, which is very frightening.</p>
<p>It is easy for the reporters to design and frame them. According to what the plaintiff said, there is more than one reporter, Lu Zhongyi. It is also said that "Lu Zhongyi said in person", "the stone should be carefully observed", "there should be no such mark", etc. Judging from the meaning of this paragraph, although it is not said what day it happened, it can be seen that the reporters come to the Customs from time to time, and the Customs discuss with them. It can also be seen that they are allowed to watch at any time, hoping to find something. If so, it is easy for them to forge the mark and stamp it on the stone, and then make a face-to-face statement. It was discovered on the side of the stone, and it can be inferred that it was done intentionally, so as to avoid not seeing it during the valuation, or to make the Customs believe it. This is the fifth disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the eighth item of the review opinions, the so-called finding the Baozhen mark is a huge injustice, so all the Burmese government's telegrams are the finishing touch. List the known facts reported by Lu Zhongyi, and add words such as "is" and "was" so that the question can be answered, so as to punish. The reason is very clear. It is said that it has nothing to do with this case, which is a light statement. This is the sixth disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the ninth item of the review opinions, the first item of the review opinions and the opinions in the original decision clearly stated that the tax bill does not belong to the rough stone in this case, which means it is replaced. If so, why say it two or three times? This is to fabricate words and make it easy to convict. The original book said that it failed to determine the facts of the whole case, which is true. It is said that it is suspected of its crime, which is also true. The committee defended it, but what is the intention? This is the seventh disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the tenth item of the review opinions, the tax bill is as mentioned above, so let it be. The plaintiff did not consider himself a shareholder of the company, so there should be no possibility of forgery. Also, this invoice has been signed by the consul, so it is impossible to collude. This is the eighth disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the eleventh item of the review opinions, the original book stated that it was just briefly mentioned for fear that outsiders would not understand the truth. If they pay attention to this, then the price estimated in the second decision is not credible. Once the tax is paid and released, it should not be questioned, and there is no need to wait until the future. This is the ninth disagreement with the original decision.</p>
<p>Regarding the twelfth item of the review opinions, Lu Zhongyi's malicious accusation is a narrative of the origin of this case. But why he dared to be so bold is even more difficult to ensure that he has no background. It is okay not to investigate it thoroughly, but it is not the point to say that it has nothing to do with this case. This is the tenth disagreement with the original decision. Looking at the situation of this case, the most important point is whether all the actions of the Customs in handling this case are legal. Secondly, after a penalty has been imposed once, for the same fact, based on the same regulations, and for the same act, can a heavier penalty be added? Secondly, whether submitting fake documents and underreporting the value are related under the circumstances of this case and regarded as the same act. Fourthly, whether the submitted invoice is one of the documents, and the tax bill has been used to estimate the price. Since it has not been believed and a separate price has been estimated, this is not considered submitting fake documents. The last point is whether the so-called invitation to estimate the price actually happened, and whether the regulations cited are applicable. As for the matter of discovering the Baozhen stamp, the plaintiff does not consider it important to this case, and the defendant, as stated above, has not fulfilled his responsibility to provide evidence. The plaintiff cannot admit it even if he dies. Therefore, based on the above reasons, this lawsuit is filed in accordance with the law. I respectfully request that your court, taking into account that the plaintiff is innocent and has suffered misfortune for more than half a year, quickly conduct a fair trial and revoke the original order of the first defendant and the original decision of the second defendant in accordance with the law, and order the defendants to return the rough stone to the plaintiff, in order to uphold justice. I am very much looking forward to your order. Respectfully submitted to the Administrative Court, Petitioner: Chen Kaiqing, December 27th, Year 24.</p>

<p>The forty district branches of the Shanghai Municipal Citizen's Federation, in response to the Citizen's Association's advocacy against gambling, yesterday jointly sent a letter to the Citizen's Association, stating: Respectfully, after reading the public notice regarding the anti-gambling case, we deeply appreciate your enthusiasm for eliminating harm to the people and your concern for the people's livelihood. The branch associations share your sentiments and are deeply gratified. Upon investigation, the harm of gambling is no less than that of floods and fierce beasts; it can lead to forgetting meals and abandoning sleep, going on day and night, hindering legitimate occupations, and inducing opportunistic attempts. It is not merely a medium for teaching theft but directly a tool for bankruptcy and self-destruction. At a time when the market is depressed and the economy is collapsing, and the number of unemployed people is increasing daily, how can we turn a blind eye to gambling, which harms people? However, if there are no places in the city where people can gamble at will, then even those who are addicted to gambling will have no opportunity to degenerate. Therefore, in addition to all the unidentified secret gambling dens, other places like Jai Alai courts and dog racing tracks are all obvious sources of misfortune in our city. Since our city has such obvious sources of misfortune, we should rise up together to find ways to eliminate them. The branch associations, noting that this gambling collects a huge amount of money every year, and finding it difficult to tolerate the leakage of funds and the failure to save citizens who are obsessed and unawakened from the abyss, must support and unanimously advocate for the prohibition of gambling. We earnestly request your association to make vigorous efforts to achieve the goal of prohibiting gambling.</p>

Their artistic skills have long been admired by people in Shanghai, and there is no need to repeat them. In order to completely eliminate the vulgar customs of Peking Opera theaters, the owner of the theater has decided to follow the methods of high-end cinemas, abolish the usher tea rooms, and instead use female inspectors as ushers. All audience members will purchase tickets and be seated, and fragrant tea will be given as a gift, without fruit platters or tips. This will reduce the burden on the audience. In addition to the ticket price, there will be no other expenses. The performance time will be from 8:30 p.m. to 12:00 p.m., so that the audience will not feel tired.

<p>According to the Public Concession Health Department's report for December of last year, the sanitary conditions in the city last month did not undergo any major changes. Except for a few exceptions, all notifiable infectious diseases were not significantly different from the same month of the previous year. Malaria has also sharply decreased due to the weather. An outbreak of diphtheria occurred at a certain Chinese children's school established by the Bureau, but thanks to the effective handling by the newly established school health team, the disease did not spread. Furthermore, due to the inclement weather, vaccination work could not be carried out as much as possible. Therefore, the number of people vaccinated last month was only 25,976. However, several cases of smallpox occurred within the Concession during the month. Those who have not been vaccinated recently should take measures to get vaccinated as soon as possible for prevention, especially the laboring class, which cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the statistics for births and deaths in the Concession in this city in December show that 83 foreign babies were born, 75 of whom resided within the Concession, including 43 male babies and 32 female babies. The number of Chinese babies born has decreased compared to last month, with only over 1,500 reported, 1,459 of whom resided within the Concession, including 760 male babies and 699 female babies. Regarding deaths, 45 foreigners died, of whom non-Chinese Asians accounted for 58%. The biggest causes of death were tuberculosis, pneumonia, typhoid fever, tumors, and suicide. The biggest causes of death for Chinese were old age, tuberculosis, brain diseases, heart disease, and bronchitis.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on January 16, "A Major Fire in Bailianjing, Pudong Last Night," stating that the Yuchang Bamboo Company in Bailianjing Port, Pudong, was a branch of the Hu Yuchang Wood Company on South Dongjiadu in the Southern City. This is very shocking. After investigation, our company specializes in the wood business and does not engage in the bamboo business, and there is no fact that the Yuchang Bamboo Company is set up in Bailianjing. The report is completely inconsistent with the facts. I hereby request you to correct it to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. Yours truly, Hu Yuchang Wood Company, January 19, 25th year of the Republic of China.</p>

This time, the team will travel to Shanghai to compete with the Shanghai Chinese, North China, and the Hong Kong-Shanghai interport team's Western Union team, among others.</p>

Ennis performed exceptionally well in yesterday's game, especially Calon, who scored three goals, which was not easy. In the first half, the Ideal Team lost a penalty kick opportunity and Ennis took the lead with 2-1. After the start of the second half, the Ideal Team still did not perform satisfactorily. Ennis used its entire army and scored a goal. Finally, Ennis Macquitt fouled, and the Ideal Team scored a penalty, resulting in a final score of 3-2, with the Ideal Team losing to Ennis.</p>
<p>Disappointing Performance of the Ideal Team</p>
<p>Nine out of ten members of the Ideal Team will be the official interport representatives, so yesterday's defeat to Ennis was not only beyond the expectations of the fans but also shocked the selection committee. The performance of the entire team was far below standard. The forwards had no cooperation. Huo He's absence caused the forwards to lose their soul. Mai Yuan seemed at a loss, and Li Ning was not as good as usual. Costey was still good in the first half, but also as soft as cotton in the second half. The two goalkeepers both had excellent performances, especially Smeaton, who was highly praised.</p>
<p>Ennis Takes the Lead</p>
<p>Before 3 o'clock, the two sides loosened their muscles. When referee Julam's silver whistle sounded, they formed their formations and fought. The Ideal Team took the offensive first. The ball was moved under Fu Wei's feet, and Kola and Xia 서로 responded. Gu Naer Shi showed his skills and intercepted the ball halfway, and 送 开墨尔 transported the ball to the front. Fortunately, Li Ning saved the situation and was not ravaged. MacKingtai invaded from the periphery, cooperating with Calon to sweep down three lines of defense and forced into the hinterland of the Ideal Team. Calon did not panic and swept the ground, and the ball rolled into the net, opening the record. After Ennis succeeded, his morale was high. Calon galloped all over the field, bravely crowning the three armies. From then on, the ball often wandered in the Ideal Team's territory, with many dangers. Fortunately, Li Ning 탈 off the left block and right block, saving many dangerous balls. Huo Wei, the bald man, sat in the center and led the three armies to kill forward mightily. A short and small shot was shot by Steve, but Smeaton blocked it. Then, Kola was too high and did not enter. Chen Zhenhe rose from the periphery, crossed Chencang secretly, and stole a pass to Bosselli to kick in, but it was cancelled for being offside. Huo Wei rose from the army and kicked off a bang, and Bosselli caught up with the top flower, creating a draw.</p>
<p>Trailing by One Goal in the First Half</p>
<p>The Ideal Team marched to victory, its momentum was strong, Jia Youliang raised the flag on the edge of the field and advanced to the center. Bosselli put a head on it, but was smashed out by Smeaton with a fist. Xiao Hei Tan Dongshan rose again and was blocked again. Smeaton's performance was wonderful, high-blocking and low-blocking, saving many dangerous balls. From then on, the enemy's trail was scattered in front of Ennis's gate. Ding MacLer fouled, and the judge judged the 12-yard. Who knew that Costa's fine was too biased and hit the door post and彈. This ball did not enter, and the Ideal Team was still not discouraged. Kola 整整 the military Rong and broke into the enemy camp with a single gun and horse. He pulled up his hairy legs and the ball entered the corner of the net. Xiao Jia's offside was cancelled again. Kostan's rear defense responded, and the long shot failed. The enemy general McFarlane, commanding the army and killing him mightily, Li Ning failed to stop him, the enemy's situation was arrogant and the crisis was lurking. Fortunately, Manley's feet were not accurate, and he kicked the wild ball. Xiao Hei Tan took advantage of the situation and secretly ordered Xiao Jia to respond. Youliang 底 底 Bottom The center of the line passed the ball to the center, and Kola greeted him with the top of his head. The results were due to Huo Wei's old age, and the steps were delayed and the work was abandoned. Huo Wei attempted to commit crimes and did not count the dangers, and drove straight into the enemy's territory with a single ride, and failed to succeed. At this time, the ankle of the British general 開 Er was injured and fought in pain, and his courage was doubled. He leaped up and was waved out by Bai Saizhong. Calon ran up from the crowd to build his achievements and returned. Before long, the whistle sounded long, and the results in the first half were that the British army took the lead with 2-1</p>
<p>3-1 The Situation is Even Worse</p>
<p>After that, both sides changed places and decided to compete again. Ennis's spirit was 万丈, and he pressed hard. Huo Wei was unmoved and still stood like Mount Tai, leading the generals to snatch the camp. However, he was blocked by the McLer brothers. Bosselli broke through diagonally, but failed to make merit. Calon rose in the border area, unrelentingly, raised his feet and shot hard, and Bai Lizhong jumped out and caught Adou, turning the danger into safety. Xiao Hei Tan's heroic style was still the same, and he broke into the formation with the ball, but was blocked by the McLer brothers before passing three levels. Xiao Hei Tan had no way to use the law, and he re-raised his army to steal the enemy's formation with a plan to adjust the tiger away from the mountain, and switched from Bosselli to Huo Wei. Huo welcomed him with his bald head, but it was too biased and failed to hit him. Calon revealed the banner to transport troops and even broke through three levels. The head and feet kicked and was blocked back by Xiang Saizhong. Manley Dongshan rose again and forced into the Ideal Team's hinterland. Calon caught up and kicked Bai Saizhong with a bang. The two fell at the same time, but fortunately they did not lose. Er Manley was injured, Calon invaded the territory, and got the assistance of Cooper McGinty on the left and right, and shot into a ball, which became three to one.</p>
<p>Finally, a Twelve-Yard</p>
<p>At that time, Ennis's five forwards were all working hard, and their connections were pure and hot. Among them, Calon was particularly galloped all over the field, and his spirit was hundreds of times. Manley was injured and transported the ball, and he was still able to do so. He teamed up with Capeel and killed the previous enemy. Bai Saizhong saw that the situation was not good and hurried out to block it, and was not ravaged. Cooper sat in the center and commanded the three armies, like a general's demeanor. He took the lead by himself and went straight in. But what can I do if his feet are not accurate? Xiao Hei Tan saw that it was all the enemy's power, and couldn't help but burn with anger. He was lonely and forced to go all the way, and the McTeeth saw that it was not working, and stood up to block the drive. Accidentally fouled and was sentenced to twelve yards. Costen feared that he would repeat the same mistake, and carefully fined him. As expected, he did not live up to the public's expectations and succeeded in one fell swoop. Before long, the time had arrived and the troops were collected. As a result, three to two, the Ideal Team was defeated. The main reason for the failure was that he lost a twelve-yard opportunity in the first half, and then made a big mistake. He also broke the enemy's gate twice, but was cancelled due to offside, otherwise it would not be difficult to defeat the stubborn Ennis in one fell swoop. The lines of the two teams are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>At this time when the national crisis is increasingly serious, the people of the whole country should pay attention to sports and temper their body and soul. In recent years, our country has vigorously promoted sports and can be said to have done its best. For example, the central government and various provinces and cities have sports administrative staff who specialize in sports affairs. National Games and local primary and secondary school sports meets are held on time. This year, the government will allocate huge funds to participate in the World Games. However, holding various sports competitions is not enough to temper the body and soul of the people in China today. Let us observe that after the war, Germany focused on morning exercises throughout the country and promoted military training in sports, achieving remarkable results. Sports administrative personnel in our country should intensify their work, deeply study the national crisis sports plan, implement it and seek practical results, and hopefully not be biased towards sports competitions.

<h3 id="e176">Recent News on the Promotion of Education at All Levels in Guangdong <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The following is a summary of the recent developments in the promotion of education at all levels in Guangdong Province: "Primary Education" The province, in accordance with the three-year policy plan, urges counties and cities to implement compulsory education. According to reports from various counties, the number of schools has been increasing year by year, and the number of out-of-school children has been gradually decreasing. It also coordinates the overall situation and selects counties that are known to be poor to provide subsidies to help them make adjustments. In the 24th year, the subsidy was increased to more than 120,000 yuan, plus the central government subsidy of 120,000 yuan, and the counties raised more than 500,000 yuan themselves. Statistics show that within the 24th year, a total of 1,130 short-term primary schools must be opened. In addition, the counties must still consider the local conditions and actively promote ordinary primary schools in order to make education universal throughout the province in the shortest possible time to comply with the provisions of the three-year policy plan. "Secondary Education" The province originally had 13 provincial secondary schools, 8 normal schools, and 5 vocational schools. Following the Ministry of Education's order to reduce the number of ordinary secondary schools and promote vocational education and normal education year by year, the province has implemented the order and divided the province into ten normal school districts in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Vocational schools also follow the district planning of normal school districts. This year, it is planned to add four provincial secondary schools: one provincial Lao Jiang Normal School, two provincial Changsha Normal Schools, three provincial Shantou Fisheries Vocational Schools, and implement the procedure in three phases. The first phase is to set up a fishing department, the second phase is to set up a manufacturing department, and the third phase is to set up an aquaculture department. The 24th year is the second phase to handle the fishing department, enrolling one class each for the senior and junior groups. The province has also set up a provincial sports school to cultivate specialized sports talents, which is divided into three classes: a two-year sports specialty course, enrolling high school graduates or those with equivalent qualifications; a three-year sports normal school course, enrolling junior high school graduates or those with graduates from equivalent schools; and a one-year training course, enrolling current secondary school physical education teachers or those who have worked in professional sports for more than five years. "Higher Education" In order to cultivate high-level industrial technical talents, the province selects government-funded students to study abroad. In addition to the four students who studied in Europe and the United States in the previous year, Huang Guanyue, Tang Yushu, Lu Wen, and Fu Dicai, who were assigned to study papermaking, textile, hydropower, and silk weaving industries, have reported their achievements in the past year. This year (24th year), five students were selected to study abroad: Lin Shihe, specializing in aircraft manufacturing; Huang Yichen, specializing in school building engineering; Zhao Shanhuan, specializing in entomology. The above three students are all sent to the United States. Liu Fukang is sent to the United Kingdom to study shipbuilding, and Huang Dunhan is sent to Japan to study physical education. "Social Education" The Provincial Education Department issued measures for counties and cities to establish public education centers, requiring them to establish public education centers within a time limit as the center of social education in various counties and cities. According to reports from counties and cities, the number of establishments has been increasing year by year. The latest survey shows that Fangcheng has seven, Nanhai and Shunde have five each, Panyu has three, Sanshui and Chaoan have two each, and the remaining 43 counties such as Zhongshan and Shantou City have one each, totaling 68, an increase of about 15 from the previous year. In addition, the villagers in Xinzhao, Panyu County, are mostly engaged in agriculture. Recently, Guangdong Construction set up a sugar factory there, and the nearby residents mostly make a living by planting sugarcane. Local construction has also been flourishing. At the time of the decline of the countryside, psychological construction must be combined with material construction. The Provincial Education Department ordered the Provincial Public Education Center and the Guangzhou District First Sugarcane Construction Site to jointly establish a Public Education Experimental Zone in Rongyong to facilitate the implementation of public education and establish a center for new rural construction, and an experiment has already been established.</p>

<h3 id="e184">World Oil Supply and Demand Situation (Continued) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>World Oil Supply and Demand Situation</p>
<p>Because oil occupies an important position in military industry, the oil industry has developed considerably in all capitalist countries around the world, even when they are experiencing industrial recession. The prosperity or decline of the oil industry depends on the number of various automobiles, airplanes, steamships, etc. In 1931, there were 35,784,000 automobiles in the world. Due to the economic panic, the number of vehicles decreased slightly in the following two years: 33,603,000 in 1932 and 33,331,000 in 1933. Since 1934, due to the urgency of warplanes, the number of various automobiles has increased again, reaching 34,900,000, an increase of 8% compared to 1933, requiring 67,500,000 tons of naphtha, an increase of 6.9% compared to 1933. According to a report by the Paris Business Survey Institute, the index of new light automobile registrations in the four major capitalist countries is as follows (1933 is counted as 100):</p>
<p>Country 1933 1934</p>
<p>United States 136.2 173.3</p>
<p>United Kingdom 119.7 148.3</p>
<p>France 108.1 111.5</p>
<p>Germany 199.5 318.4</p>
<p>Although the demand for oil increased in 1934, there was a contradictory phenomenon: the price of oil fell, especially the price of oil products. The main reason for this is the intensification of national oil self-sufficiency policies and the dumping competition among international oil trusts, which led to an increase in the demand for oil, but the price fell instead. The collapse of the oil market has had the greatest impact on the United States, the world's largest oil producer. Although the government has actively worked to control the oil market and stabilize production, and has issued the Oil Industry Law, its effectiveness is not significant.</p>
<p>In 1934, world oil production increased, with the United States accounting for more than 60% of the world's production. The redistribution of world oil resources and the competition for sales markets among other trusts in the world became increasingly acute. The discovery of the new oil fields in Iraq in 1934 intensified the competition among trusts. On the one hand, countries are developing their own oil industry and oil refining industry, and at the same time, they are preparing for war. The so-called "oil national policy," "oil independence policy," or "oil self-sufficiency policy" is developing rapidly, destroying the original supply and demand relationship in the oil market. The contradiction between overproduction and insufficient oil supply cannot be reconciled, so the demand increases, but the price falls. The trend of world oil production and demand in recent years is as follows:</p>
<p>World Oil Production and Demand</p>
<p>Year Production Amount Index Demand Amount Index Production Exceeds</p>
<p>(Million Tons) (Million Tons) Demand (Million Tons)</p>
<p>Stimulated by the US Oil Industry Law in 1934, the production amount increased greatly. The total production in 1933 and 1934 exceeded the demand by a huge amount of 18.5 million tons.</p>
<p>The fall in the price of world oil products is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Average Price Index of World Oil Products (1929—100)</p>
<p>Year Paraffin Oil Kerosene Gas Oil Heavy Oil</p>
<p>The Italian Oil Problem</p>
<p>The United States naturally occupies the most important position in today's world oil war, because its production accounts for more than 60% of the world's production, but today, due to the Italian-Abyssinian War, the international oil embargo against Italy has attracted more attention.</p>
<p>Like coal, Italy's oil has been repeatedly prospected by experts, costing the government a lot of public funds. As a result, it has been found that there are no oil resources in the country. Italy only extracts thousands of tons of inferior oil in its own country every year, and the cost is 0.3% higher than ordinary oil. Therefore, Italy has made great efforts to obtain a source of oil supply and ensure that oil will not be lacking in wartime.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to develop its own oil refining industry, Italy has sought the supply of raw materials from various countries by various means. First, it obtained the exclusive right to exploit local oil from the Albanian government, and then it seized the Romanian oil mining rights. After the discovery of the new oil fields in Iraq, Italy was also a powerful member of the international vested interests.</p>
<p>According to the Italian government's estimate, according to the original plan, 200,000 tons of crude oil can be obtained from Albania by 1936, and 300,000 tons are expected to be imported from Romania, and 400,000 to 500,000 tons can be obtained from Iraq. In this way, Italy can not only use 50% for its own use, but also have a surplus. If this plan is successful, Italy's oil trade policy with various countries will change, that is, it will try its best to increase the import of oil products in order to develop its own oil refining industry and control its own oil market.</p>
<p>In recent years, Italy's oil refining industry has gradually developed. The trend is as follows: (Unit: 1,000 tons) —</p>
<p>In 1934, Italy's oil market was under intense competition from international trusts, and the domestic oil industry was under great pressure, so production decreased significantly. The import of oil products developed annually, as shown in the following table: (Unit: 1,000 tons)</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen the deep relationship between Italy and other countries in oil trade. It is not easy to achieve the "oil self-sufficiency policy." On January 1, 1935, the quota permit system for the import of oil products was implemented for a period of two years. During this time, the domestic oil industry was actively developed, and a new oil industry law was promulgated in order to develop the domestic industry and achieve self-sufficiency. However, when the Italian-Abyssinian War began in 1925, the oil embargo became a powerful tool in international economic sanctions. If the war continues and countries can truly achieve an oil embargo, Italy's oil panic will inevitably occur.</p>
<p>The oil embargo against Italy has not yet been resolved, and disputes have arisen among the great powers. For example, after the League of Nations notified the oil embargo against Italy on November 18, 1935, the Soviet Union and Romania expressed their approval, while Canada expressed its opposition. The United States, the world's largest oil producer, issued a so-called neutrality, and there is so-called spiritual support for the League of Nations, but there is no concrete decision. However, this matter has aroused great repercussions from the Italian Fascists. For example, the Fascist Grand Council emergency meeting on November 18 last year resolved that if the League of Nations Committee prohibits members from exporting oil, Italy will immediately withdraw from the League of Nations, sever diplomatic relations with the sanctioning countries, and withdraw its ambassadors and consuls. One hundred and twenty-five Italian air force members formed a suicide squad to bomb the essence of the British Navy in the Mediterranean. The air force generals were determined to die, causing the annihilation of the British Mediterranean fleet. Soon, the Italian ambassadors to Britain and France also sent protests, the main point of which was that if Britain and France implemented an oil embargo, Italy would retaliate with acts of war. From this, it can also be seen Italy's panic about oil and the importance of oil in war. After all, Britain is still willing to maintain Italy's original position in Europe and is concerned about the Far East issue. Germany's large-scale rearmament does not want to be too suited to Italy, so the oil embargo is not intended to be realized. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e185">An Analysis of the American Cotton Marketing Cooperative System <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Honggen</p>
<p>Cotton is one of the main agricultural products of both China and the United States. In the case of the United States, its cotton production accounts for more than 50% of the world's total, and its annual cotton export value reaches approximately 500 million US dollars, accounting for about 16% of the total export value. In the case of China, cotton production ranks third in the world, with an annual output of about 8 million dan, and exports of about 6-700,000 dan. Taking the year 1933 as an example, cotton exports totaled 723,632 dan, worth 30,238,958 yuan, accounting for 4.94% of the total export value, ranking sixth. Given that the cotton production of these two countries occupies such an important position, the study and improvement of cotton production and marketing systems are essential. Although there are various ways to improve the system in the United States, the cooperative method occupies an important position. Over the past 20 years, through the joint efforts of the government, academic groups, the financial sector, and farmers, remarkable results have been achieved. In contrast, in our country, cotton production has been decreasing in recent years, imports of foreign cotton have surged, production technology has not been reformed at all, and many malpractices have emerged in the marketing system. If this continues, it will inevitably endanger the livelihoods of cotton farmers. The government authorities and enlightened people are aware of this, and have therefore jointly sought ways to remedy the situation. The Cotton Industry Control Committee, the Cotton Production Improvement Institutes in various provinces, the North China Agricultural Improvement Society, and the cotton marketing cooperatives established in various places have emerged one after another. However, cotton production improvement cannot be achieved in a short period of time, while the improvement of cotton marketing is easier to achieve. The various malpractices in the American cotton marketing system before its reform were very similar to those in our country. Moreover, their cooperative marketing system to remedy these malpractices has some aspects that can be applied to our country. I have collected relevant information on American cotton cooperative marketing and compiled it into this article, hoping to provide a reference for those in China engaged in the cotton industry.</p>
<p>(1) Shortcomings of the Original American Cotton Marketing System</p>
<p>To understand the American cotton marketing cooperation system, it is necessary to first explore the shortcomings of its original system. The following are the main points:</p>
<p>(A) Ginning</p>
<p>(1) Ginning Costs: Most cotton farmers do not have their own ginning machines, and after collecting the cotton, they send it to privately-run ginning factories to be ginned into lint cotton. The purpose of ginning factories is to make a profit, so they inevitably increase ginning costs as much as possible. Every 100 pounds of seed cotton requires about 30 to 50 US cents. Cottonseeds are considered too little in quantity by cotton farmers, so they often do not ask the factories for them, and the factories accumulate a small amount into a large amount, which can also generate extra income.</p>
<p>(2) Ginning Quality: The machines used in privately-run ginning factories are mostly decayed, and their efficiency is reduced. During ginning, they often fail to clearly separate the cotton lint from the cottonseeds, and sometimes even mix in unclean substances such as mud and sand, reducing the quality of the lint cotton and thus damaging the cotton's selling price.</p>
<p>(B) Failure to Grade Cotton Quality: At the beginning of cotton sales, there was no such thing as grading. Transactions were based only on samples. Later, as cotton textile factories became more developed, they needed cotton of uniform quality for weaving various cotton textiles. Therefore, grading methods gradually emerged in the cotton market. However, in the beginning, the grading was arbitrary and without fixed standards. Buyers often deliberately lowered the grade of the cotton they purchased to gain an advantage, which easily caused disputes between the two parties. In 1923, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A) formulated a Universal Cotton Standard Act. Based on the results of the cotton market, it was proven that Middling Cotton was the highest grade. Cotton above this grade could not be sold at a higher price. Under this marketing system, cotton farmers would not be willing to produce long-staple cotton to increase their burden. Because the shorter the cotton lint, the lower the production cost than that of long-staple cotton, and the yield of lint cotton is higher than that of long-staple cotton. If cotton prices are not based on the quality of the cotton, then cotton farmers will inevitably compete to plant short-staple cotton, and the quality of the cotton will decline daily.</p>
<p>(C) Profiteering by Middlemen: From the producer to the consumer, cotton passes through many levels, including ginners, cotton merchants, cotton shops, cotton brokers, cotton warehouses, and consignment stores. Each stage is exploited once, so the cotton price received by cotton farmers is reduced.</p>
<p>(D) Adulteration and Cheating of Cotton: If cotton farmers sell seed cotton to ginners, then they intentionally leave a gap in the machine during ginning to make an unexpected income. Some also add water to the lint cotton, with the maximum addition being 20% to 30%. Even if the ginners do not cheat in this way, when the cotton is transferred to other middlemen, they will inevitably cheat in this way.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned malpractices are only the major ones, but they are already enough to show the urgency of reform. The cooperative marketing system thus emerged. According to the American cotton transport cooperative organization, there are two types: state cooperatives and the national federation (i.e., the American Cotton Growers Exchange). The following describes their general situation in order:</p>
<p>(2) State Cotton Marketing Cooperatives</p>
<p>(A) Principles and Policies: State cotton marketing cooperatives are all non-stock, non-profit societies. Cooperatives are purely service-oriented and do not require equipment that consumes huge amounts of money. All transportation costs, insurance fees, interest, operating expenses, etc., are shared according to the amount of cotton delivered by the members. Most cooperative members are limited to residents of a certain region or a certain state. Sometimes, only members of certain special farmer groups can join. For example, the Arkansas Cotton Production and Marketing Cooperative must limit membership to members of the Farmers' Association. Members need to pay a membership fee to join the cooperative. Some stipulate that ten yuan must be paid at one time, while others stipulate that 25 cents per bale should be charged for each individual's sales volume. In addition, two contracts need to be signed: one is the organizational contract, which states the purpose and principles of the organization, the operating plan, membership qualifications, etc.; the other is the sales contract or agreement, which contains the responsibilities, rights, and terms of the parties signing the contract. If a member breaches the contract and fails to deliver the stipulated cotton, the cooperative will impose a fine of three to ten cents per pound. The contract term is mostly five years. The previous IronClad Contract stipulated that members could not freely withdraw from the cooperative during the contract period. Later, it was revised so that those who wish to withdraw from the cooperative must notify the cooperative in writing before the second Wednesday of May each year. After verification and approval by the person in charge, the contractual relationship can be terminated.</p>
<p>(B) Structure and Management: State cooperatives are centralized, with only one central organization. No branches are established in various localities, but the regions under their jurisdiction are divided into several districts, each with an office. All contract signing and ginning factories and warehouses established in the area are directly managed by the cooperative. The management agency of the cooperative is the board of directors. The directors are elected by farmers in each district. The method is to first conduct a preliminary election in each district, and then elect directors from the representatives. Each member has only one vote to prevent manipulation. All directors are unpaid, but they are given a reasonable allowance for travel expenses during meetings. In addition to the board of directors, three to five members are designated to form a committee to execute daily affairs. The cooperative has one chairman, one vice-chairman, and one secretary-accountant each. In order to improve operating efficiency, the cooperative is specially divided into accounting, finance, marketing, and service departments, each with a department head responsible for handling matters.</p>
<p>(C) Operating Methods: (1) Collecting Flowers and Sampling: During the cotton picking season, offices in various districts send collectors to collect cotton from cotton farmers and transport it to the nearest squeezing plant (Cinoress). The office sends people to take samples to identify their grades. If cotton farmers urgently need money, they can borrow a certain amount of cotton prices at this time. Another method is for members to pack the cotton themselves and send it directly to the warehouse designated by the cooperative, or hand it over to the railway bureau to transport it to the designated warehouse. The warehouse manager takes one sample on each side of each bale. All samples are sent to the cooperative's head office, and the cooperative hires trained and licensed Cotton Classers to grade them and issue grade certificates. The cooperative then combines samples of the same grade in one place and registers the number of bales of each grade delivered by each member.</p>
<p>(2) Storage—Cotton is a durable agricultural product, so its trading period is longer. If it can be properly stored and evaluated at a price, then a greater profit can be obtained. Most state cotton marketing cooperatives in the United States do not build their own warehouses, but rent them from private warehouses. The reason is that the cost of building warehouses is too high. The equipment and efficiency of private warehouses are already very complete. Using the cooperative's strength to negotiate prices with them can get more favorable terms. If there is not enough cotton for storage, then it cannot be fully utilized, wasting financial resources.</p>
<p>(3) Regulating Finance: The expenses required by cooperatives can be divided into three main categories:</p>
<p>(1) Operating expenses of the marketing organization—can be further divided into permanent equipment expenses (such as houses and utensils, etc.) and recurring operating expenses (such as salaries, commissions, etc.). The former are appropriated from the public reserve fund extracted according to the sales volume, and the latter are funded by the commissions paid by the members.</p>
<p>(2) Expenses required for marketing activities—such as member advances on cotton value, transportation costs, etc. The amount required depends on the number of bales of cotton received, the percentage of advance cotton value, the level of market prices, and the level of freight rates. Since the cooperative is a non-stock organization, it must borrow money from banks or government agencies, using cotton warehouse receipts and bills of lading as collateral.</p>
<p>(3) Assistance to members in production or other aspects—Most cotton farmers in the southern United States are tenant farmers with very little capital of their own. They feel powerless to purchase fertilizers and seeds during cotton production, and mostly purchase production supplies on credit from local merchants or borrow money from small banks, using green seedlings as collateral. The cooperative must provide financial assistance to these members to relieve their difficulties. To meet this need, each cooperative establishes an affiliated financial company, issues stocks to raise funds, and lends them to members.</p>
<p>(4) Sales and Calculation of Loans: The cooperative has a marketing department, headed by an experienced person, or an affiliated company is established to operate independently. There are two methods of selling cotton by the cooperative. The first is mixed sales, also known as the pooling method, which combines cotton of the same grade from members, and sells it successively until the end of a pooling period (one day, one week, one month, one year, etc.). The average price per bale is obtained by dividing the total number of bales of cotton of each grade by the total sales price of each grade, and then distributing it according to the number of bales of cotton of each grade delivered by each member. (However, various deductible expenses need to be deducted first.) The second is the individual sales method. The member who delivers the cotton determines its sales period and minimum price, and accepts the remaining cotton price after deducting transportation and sales costs. However, this method is to accommodate cotton farmers who are unwilling to join the pooling method. After cotton farmers recognize the benefits of pooling, they all wish to abandon their opinions. Therefore, individual sales have been gradually reduced. The targets of cotton sales are major cotton textile factories at home and abroad. The cooperative sends agents to major cotton markets to be responsible for sales. Since the establishment of the American Cotton Growers Exchange, many state cooperatives have entrusted it to sell on their behalf.</p>
<p>(5) Ginning: The malpractices of private ginning factories have been described in detail earlier. However, cooperatives' operation of the ginning industry is to be completed last. Because it is a centralized organization, local cooperative ginning factories are supervised and directed by the head office, which sends people to manage them. Cotton farmers only have the right to use them. The location of the ginning factories must take into account the amount of cotton ginned and the distance from the members. Members who submit seed cotton for ginning also charge a small fee. From a cooperative point of view, the effectiveness of ginning factories is quite great. Because in a centralized organization, the distance between members and the cooperative is very far, and there is no spiritual maintenance. If cooperative ginning factories can be established in rural areas or towns, then farmers' relationship with the cooperative will be closer and their faith will be deeper. Moreover, ginning factories can also be used as places to collect cotton, replacing the location of squeezing plants. After ginning into lint cotton, samples are taken and then packaged and transported to warehouses, to avoid the trouble of sampling in the future.</p>
<p>(3) American Cotton Growers Exchange</p>
<p>After the establishment of state cotton marketing cooperatives, there was still no joint organization to standardize the marketing system and assist in the marketing operations of various cooperatives. The Texas and Oklahoma cooperatives first created this type of organization, and held an inaugural meeting in 1921, named the American Cotton Growers Exchange. At that time, a total of twelve state cooperatives joined. The following describes its general situation:</p>
<p>(A) Principles and Organization: This exchange, like the state cooperatives, is a non-stock, non-profit organization. It has no articles of association or bylaws, and only maintains its transactions based on the contracts signed when members join the society. The exchange has a total of twelve departments: (1) Administration and Execution Department, (2) Management Department, (3) Classification and Standards Department, (4) Lending Department, (5) Insurance Department, (6) Transportation Department, (7) Finance Department, (8) Statistics Department, (9) General Cotton Sales Department, (10) Fine Cotton Sales Department, (11) Legal Department, (12) Field Service Department. The general office is located in Memphis, Tennessee.</p>
<p>(B) Management: The exchange has a board of directors, composed of three people elected by each cooperative. They are re-elected every year. In addition, the government appoints three public directors to protect public interests. The board of directors meets twice or three times a year, convened by the chairman, to determine operating policies according to the provisions of the contract. In addition, there is an executive committee, composed of one representative from each society. It meets once a month and is responsible for carrying out all affairs. The society has one chairman, one vice-chairman, and one secretary-accountant each.</p>
<p>(C) Business: The business undertaken by the exchange can be divided into four major categories:</p>
<p>(1) Sales: State cooperatives that feel that sales are not widespread, or that have excessive amounts and are unable to sell them, can entrust the exchange to sell on their behalf. The exchange has agents in major cotton markets at home and abroad, who report on market conditions at all times and represent the exchange in negotiating transactions. State cooperatives can thus save the labor of sales.</p>
<p>(2) Regulating Finance—The exchange can use its strong influence to negotiate loans with major banks to resolve the financial difficulties of state cooperatives. However, when a loan is established, the state cooperatives must directly sign a contract with the lender. The exchange is only in the position of a mediator.</p>
<p>(3) Field Services—The service department of the exchange specializes in investigating the operating methods of state cooperatives, learning from each other's strengths and promoting them widely, so that each society can gradually adopt uniform and perfect methods. In addition, it assists the service departments of state cooperatives in developing their society affairs.</p>
<p>(4) Statistics—This is the work most valued by the branches of the exchange, that is, collecting cotton transport figures in the market, such as supply, consumption, long-term trends in cotton prices, seasonal changes in cotton prices, etc., analyzing them, and reporting them to the state cotton marketing cooperatives. State cooperatives can predict the relationship between supply and demand in the market and determine their sales policies.</p>
<p>(D) Operating Methods: All state cooperatives organized according to pure cooperative principles can register with the exchange. After approval by the executive committee, they can sign a contract with the society, designate three representatives as directors, and one person as an executive committee member. The procedures are completed. Thereafter, if there is cotton that can be entrusted to the exchange to sell on its behalf, and they can enjoy other rights. The exchange's expenses are very low. All sales expenses are divided according to the number of bales of cotton delivered by each society, and a small commission is collected for the society's expenses.</p>
<p>The above is only a brief description of the American cotton marketing cooperation system. As for its advantages and disadvantages, due to space limitations, they cannot be described in detail. I will write a supplementary note another day.</p>
<p>Business News</p>
<h3 id="e186">Finance: Financial Clearing Procedures are More Complicated <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market was as calm as usual. Although the closing period is imminent, there is no sign of tightening. Banks are lending as much as possible and accommodating overdrafts. The market situation is therefore loose, and the closing period can be passed safely. However, the clearing procedures are more complicated. The overnight interest rate remains at the original price, unchanged from beginning to end, both morning and afternoon at eight percent. In overnight transactions, morning market transfers were more than 3.8 million, new transactions were more than 60 million, afternoon market transactions were more than 400,000, and small general meeting transactions were more than 800,000. Bank collections were made on a holiday schedule. The Shanghai Native Bank Clearing House received more than 48 million yuan in collection notes. In subsidiary currency transactions, the morning market traded 130,000 jiao of Guangdong small silver coins, and the afternoon market traded 40,000 jiao. The black market rate was 11.8 jiao, down 1 li from the previous day. 29,400 strings of copper coins were traded, worth 9,800 legal tender yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Securities: Rumors of Interest Rate Reduction and Postponement Hit the Bond Market Suddenly; Shorts Took Advantage of the Pressure; Military Bonds Fell More Than Six Yuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>From January 13th to 18th last week, speculation on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was intense, leading to extraordinary changes. After rumors of interest rate reductions and postponements, short sellers were extremely enthusiastic, especially those releasing forward contracts. Therefore, forward prices were lower than spot prices. The difference often exceeded the principal and interest earned each month. Normally, arbitrage transactions would roll over to the next month when they expired, involving tens of millions, and market prices would be maintained as a result. However, with the rumors of interest rate reductions and the unfavorable market prices, nearly all arbitrageurs in the market delivered their contracts this month. After the September 18th Incident, although market prices were small, the profit from hedging was very high, and a portion of investment still absorbed spot contracts. Currently, investors, except for a few retail investors, have almost disappeared from the market. Most of the market transactions are speculation. The big players on both the short and long sides are evenly matched. The shorts use rumors to deliberately make forward prices lower than spot prices, so that arbitrageurs naturally leave the market. It has already driven the important elements of investment out of the market, reducing the strength of the opposing side, and deliberately using various rumors, they are determined to make the longs yield. It can be seen that they also feel that they are too big to fail and cannot compensate. Because they rely on the interest rate reduction issue, if it is not true, then the future reaction will be even more extraordinary. The longs believe that the government stated that after the September 18th and January 28th incidents in 1932, when bond interest rates were reduced and postponed, the decision would be permanent. Moreover, even if the interest rate is reduced, it would only increase the government's income by more than one million yuan per month. Is there no other way to compensate? They must shake the bond market. If the rumor is that new bonds are being issued in exchange for old bonds, regardless of whether the interest rate and term of the new bonds are consistent with the original ones, if the interest rate is reduced and the term is extended, then the shorts who are currently shorting will definitely not be in this case. In the future, rolling over will result in huge losses. If they re-compensate, it will be easier for the longs to surround them. The above sections are indeed the actual pain of both sides recently, so there are rumors of mediators persuading both sides to settle out of court, but it is not easy to comply. Today is the last day of the year, and there will be a week's holiday afterwards, so there will be extremely large changes on this day. Investing and speculating are both once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, but unfortunately, not all can fully understand the crux of the problem. On the Saturday and Sunday of last week, retail investors covered their shorts on Wednesday, and the prices rose by a few jiao to one or two yuan. The remaining days were all under the pressure of the shorts, and the market prices gradually declined. The rumors of interest rate reductions became more and more true, but no formal announcement was ever seen, and whether it actually happened or not, the market rumors all aimed at this point as the only goal. Ticket holders and the financial community across the country are panicked. On Thursday, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Beijing requesting an announcement, which boosted morale. In the end, the rumors did not have good results, and market prices rose and fell, still trending downward. After that, market prices felt more and more unsustainable, and on Friday, they fell by about two and a half yuan. Saturday was the most serious period for rumors of interest rate reductions. Military bonds and Nine Goodness bonds suddenly fell to the limit. The market sentiment was extremely weak, but those who went long were not very flustered, and especially retail investors were very interested in eating in. The competition between the long and short sides has reached its peak, and it will soon be unveiled. Let us wait and see. The result of the week's market prices was a fall of at least more than one yuan, and the most fell by as much as six and a half yuan. The total number of transactions totaled 15,831,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>——But British and Indian Cotton Futures and Spot Prices Rose——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with sluggish conditions. Liverpool news was difficult to lower. However, due to purchases by the industry and brokers, it was able to maintain. Each month fell by one to three pounds. Unfortunately, there were few people following up with purchases. The industry is waiting for the development of new cotton plans and the government's management measures. Most of the floor transactions were of an exchange nature. Some October hedging sales were all moved back to the March and May periods. Before the close, southern hedging sales caused the market price to be depressed. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures fell by three to ten pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by two points, and futures rose by one or two points. The amount sold by European exporters of Indian cotton was all absorbed by operators covering their shorts. Later, the price was slightly softer due to futures traders selling. Pingguoer rose by 0.75 to 1.25 rupees, Aomula rose by 1.5 to 1.75 rupees, and Ziluoxi rose by 1.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 18th).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for Ziluoxi flower on the 20th was 206 rupees, down 0.75 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Last Week</p>
<p>The Market Weakened After Most of the Bulls Closed Out</p>
<p>——Brokers and Exporters Also Had Hedging Sales——</p>
<p>Last week, Indian cotton did not follow the ups and downs of US cotton. Later, the market weakened due to a large number of speculative bulls closing out, and hedging sales by brokers and exporters. Indian factories purchased some at a limited price, but there was no big amount. Therefore, current demand was not good. China was sluggish, and Japan also decreased compared to previous years. Transactions on the mainland were brisk, but there were no signs of expansion in inquiries from foreign factories. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources from all roads in Zhabei were reduced, with only five or six ships. There were about 100 ships stored in the river. Most of the firms stopped selling rice, resulting in a shortage of goods in the market. Stores with insufficient inventory slightly replenished their stock. Speculators continued to take advantage of the situation. Market prices were stable in the morning, but the closing result turned weaker by a few jiao. The early rice price was stable, the thin rice showed good interest, and the Lvjin rice continued to be handled, with market conditions tightly holding on by a few jiao. White Yuan retail was normal, and prices were stable. The prices of other goods did not fluctuate much.</p>

As the end-of-year closing approached, both buyers and sellers were focused on inventory and settling accounts, so attendance at the public market was sparse. However, behind the scenes, dealers were actively trading stockpiled goods. Shops facing tight credit secretly offered discounted prices, while those with ample funds absorbed as much stock as possible. Both insiders and outside speculators showed considerable appetite, leading to numerous under-the-table deals.</p>

<p>We all live in a house. Who wants this roof to collapse? If you don't want the roof to collapse, of course, all the pillars and beams must be repaired and strengthened. If that's not enough, more supports should be added to hold up the roof. If you harbor wishful thinking, waiting until the roof collapses to take action, then perhaps everyone will perish in that instant when the roof collapses!</p>
<p>"If you don't advance, you retreat." This is an old saying, originally used in the context of sailing. However, I believe that applying this old saying to other matters is still valuable. For example, if you are sick, if you do not quickly seek medical treatment, the illness will never heal. It will only become more serious day by day without you realizing it! Or, for example, with learning, if you do not actively study and research, you will not only fail to progress, but what you have already learned will gradually be forgotten and lost. Friends, remember this famous saying: "If you don't advance, you retreat" is the law of evolution for all things!</p>
<h3 id="e193">School Sickness <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>The United States has recently discovered a type of school sickness, said to be a product unique to schools. Sufferers are usually elementary school students, often exhibiting characteristics such as anger, anxiety, agitation, and a heightened emotional state; they also have weak stomachs, restless sleep, and frequent nightmares. These symptoms appear after the start of the school year and worsen as the semester progresses. Mental tests and athletic competitions accelerate its development.</p>
<p>The root of this neurosis lies in the suppression of children who are already somewhat neurotic. Many school systems require children to complete the same subjects at the same pace. Otherwise, the "remarks" section will be filled with words like "D grade," "stupid," "dull," or "inferior." Relatively more neurotic children struggle to keep up with their peers in one or two subjects and, under the encouragement of teachers, push themselves, resulting in a disease filled with sorrow.</p>
<p>A group of health experts is paying attention to this diagnosed illness. Some advocate that report cards should only state "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory." Others believe that schools should fundamentally eradicate the demon of "suppression."</p>
<p>Seeing this news, I am truly happy for the children in the United States. I only hope that those experts will soon develop concrete prevention methods. Following that, of course, I have to think of my own many younger siblings! They are growing up quietly, without attracting any attention or interest. So if their grades are not good, they can be ordered to stand in the corner, attend night school, or be denied food when boarding. They are scolded as "dunce," "slowpoke." At the end of the semester, the teachers consider their responsibility fulfilled by writing "inferior" on the report card. And the fathers, after receiving the report, cannot avoid being furious: on one hand, they are pained by the wasted money without any return; on the other hand, they start to abuse their children in the manner of "it is the father's fault if he raises them without instruction," reducing their material comforts in the hope that they will become self-aware?</p>
<p>If many children in China also suffer from school sickness, who would discover it and pay attention to it? Ah, save the children!</p>
<h3 id="e194">A-Grade Milk <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>There was a female student at a certain university who was once hailed as a queen. At that time, the general student body gave her a nickname: "A-Grade Milk."</p>
<p>It is said that the nickname "A-Grade Milk" has a bit of a story behind it. The reason is that the old gentleman, the female student's grandfather, started his business by raising cows. The family was in a certain colony in the South. There, they kept 200 dairy cows. A-Grade Milk had been drinking milk produced on their own farm since she was young. For more than ten years, she had never been sick, so that kind of healthy and beautiful physique was just like the A-Grade Milk in the milk shed, so it met the standard. So calling her A-Grade Milk was indeed the most accurate thing to say.</p>
<p>When A-Grade Milk was studying at that university, she would always drink one pound of A-Grade Milk a day. It was said that she had been drinking it for more than ten years, so she had to drink it. But her drinking of milk, it is said, did not require her to reach into her own pocket. Even all the other expenses outside of milk were all covered by a certain student, Mr. Ouyang. So the generous Mr. Ouyang got the nickname of "milk shed owner." Mr. Ouyang also regarded himself as the boss of the milk shed. He absolutely did not allow anyone else to touch A-Grade Milk.</p>
<p>After studying at the university for two years, the milk shed owner reached his boiling point. The lovers finally became husband and wife and finally got married. So A-Grade Milk dropped out of school and followed the boss back south to live a sweet life.</p>
<p>This was a story from the summer vacation of the year before last. After that, A-Grade Milk's news was quiet, and almost all the students forgot about her. But in the autumn of last year, A-Grade Milk was suddenly found again at another university. She had disappeared and no longer had the spotlight of the past. At first, everyone didn't know that this was A-Grade Milk from a certain university, but after two or three months, the secret was finally revealed. According to well-informed sources, A-Grade Milk and the boss divorced only half a year after they got married, so now A-Grade Milk has returned to the qualification of a young lady.</p>
<p>But A-Grade Milk, after experiencing trauma, gave up all pleasure in life and buried herself in her studies, not having any boyfriends, and became a good student who couldn't work any harder. So a group of mischievous old classmates changed her nickname to B-Grade Milk, saying that she was no longer as captivating as she used to be.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-Third: High Talk Resounds in the Air, Lawsuit to be Filed, Old Friends Reconnect Over Wine, Profit Can Be Forgotten</p>
<p>But then again, unless he completely backs down, he has to find a proper way to resolve this. Besides filing a lawsuit, what else is there? Thinking just like that, if he is going to file a lawsuit, then he doesn't need to be afraid of offending them. He heard laughter upstairs, women's voices, wasn't that the commissioner's wife? She laughed, "If you lose this lawsuit here, appeal to the High Court. If you lose in the High Court, appeal to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. Even if you lose in the Supreme Court in Nanjing, it will be a year later. You're a free person, what are you afraid of getting tangled up with him for? In this year, you can eat, drink, and dress without worry. We're all here to help you." The voice carried downstairs, still so clear. The person speaking seemed to be doing it on purpose. Jia Duocai went back into his room, lit a cigarette, lay diagonally on the bed with his legs propped up on a stool, and kept thinking about what tactics he needed to use to deal with them. He suddenly said to himself, "I've seen all kinds of storms, am I going to be intimidated by them?" So he jumped up and, using the paper, ink, brush, and inkstone that were already on the table, drafted a letter: "Editor, I have decided to hire a lawyer and formally file a lawsuit for the sake of my personal integrity. Please write about my case based on this, and do not need to worry about anything else. Sincerely, Jia Duocai." After writing the letter, he looked outside the door to see if there was a tea boy. He wanted to call a tea boy to send the letter. Then he saw the tea boy leading two people to the room next door. One of them was a large, fat man wearing a long and large blue silk robe, chewing on more than half a cigar, holding a straw hat and a cane in his hand, looking quite like an Eastern capitalist. The tea boy opened the door for him and led him in, and he heard him say in a complaining tone, "Who said the people of Xi'an don't know how to do business? They are much more cunning than us Easterners." Then a local replied, "Aren't we honest? If we were tricky, we would keep this land for a few more months and sell it after the train line is open, wouldn't we make even more [omitted]." Jia Duocai was most interested in these kinds of words, so he withdrew into the room and sat down, turning his face to listen. (893)</p>

<p>In the countryside of Wujin, there is something called "Yellow Mud Arm," referring to a young woman in the village who unfortunately became a widow and had difficulty [omitted], so she sought the consent of her parents-in-law to bring a strong man into the family to continue the family business of her late husband. But the name "Yellow Mud Arm" is strange, so I asked the elders, and they said: "Yellow Mud Arm is actually a euphemism for (preventing child famine). After the husband dies, there must be orphans, [omitted]. There is no way to make a living to feed the children, so a man is brought into the home to help raise them and prevent the children from starving," etc. That makes sense.</p>

<p>As the autumn waves of the departing god of night were about to be sent, and the fish-belly white of the east had not yet bloomed, I returned from the land of dreams, opened my sleepy eyes, and encountered you in the corner of the sky outside the window.</p>

<p>From the start, I failed your good intentions, and I still buried my head in the blanket, reluctant to leave the warmth of the blanket, and returning to my warm and sweet morning dream, neglecting you.</p>

<p>I can't sleep at night, everything is silent, but my thoughts are surging.</p>
<p>Qi Dong Ye Yu says, "The poisonous snake of worries sleeps in your heart; only when the sleeping snake leaves can you sleep peacefully." But the poisonous snakes of worries in my heart are too numerous and difficult to completely remove.</p>
<p>Insomniacs are sleepy during the day, but the work is demanding, and they can't take a nap. I occasionally read Lu Fangweng's poem about daytime naps, "Sleeping together in a ball tastes long, host and guest forget each other; soon the guest leaves and the host wakes up, the same west window has no setting sun."</p>
<p>And Wu Sengyougui's poem, "Reading has strained my brow, but lying down brings joy to my bones; when I wake up, I don't know if it's early or late, and little of the setting sun remains in the west window."</p>
<p>I think that if I could get half a day off and sleep to my heart's content, it would be the greatest pleasure in life. Even if I am ridiculed as rotten wood and dung, I would not care.</p>
<p>But this is ultimately an elegant hobby for those of the privileged class, and a poor scholar does not have this blessing.</p>

<p>The congee shop is the cheapest place to fill one's stomach. With a dozen or so copper coins, you can go in and come out with a full belly.</p>
<p>Shanghai has a large population of rich and poor residents, so the congee shops are everywhere you look. Except for closing for the first three days of the lunar new year, they are open day and night, rain or shine. Many [omitted] who don't have a proper home see the congee shop as a place to stay without paying for a room. Every night when the road is empty, you can go in and order a few bowls of thin congee to rest your feet. In this cold winter, if you know the waiter well, you can greet him and lie face down on the table, using it as a temporary residence. It seems that the congee shop's open-door policy is undoubtedly a charitable organization that shelters the poor. I hope that Shanghai's businessmen will open more small congee shops and fewer large hotels, so that homeless wanderers will have more places to stay at night.</p>

<p>Refer to the previous issue. Very detailed.</p>
<p>The western name for endocrine element is Hormone, hence the transliteration as "賀爾蒙" [Heermon]. It is secreted from endocrine glands. Some of these can be manufactured in pure state and chemically detected, such as thyroxine, parathyroid hormone, pituitary hormone, thymic hormone, adrenal hormone, and isletin from the pancreas, and testicular or ovarian hormones from the gonads.</p>
<p>Note that the gonads have different testicular and ovarian preparations, so there are male and female versions. Do not confuse them.</p>

<p>— Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>There are eight methods for quitting smoking: namely, sleep aid, vesicant, serum, denaturation, antitoxin, bloodletting, substitution, and tonification. However, some involve complicated surgery, long periods of cessation, require hospitalization, or are painful, making those who want to quit see it as a daunting task. However, the newest eighth method, the "tonification smoking cessation method," requires no surgery, no hospitalization, has a very short cessation period, no pain at all, and offers the pleasure of quitting secretly while working as usual. Therefore, smokers with a little medical knowledge are happy to adopt it.</p>
<p>When choosing medicines for the tonification smoking cessation method, the use of gonadal preparations can achieve the most satisfactory results. This is because they can restore vitality, treat illness, eliminate toxins, and break addiction. The term "tonification" is an understatement.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Spermatorrhea <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is divided into pathological and physiological. However, physiological spermatorrhea is less than one in a hundred.</p>
<p>Anything that causes frustration, dizziness, fatigue, insomnia, etc., in whole or in part, and spermatorrhea that occurs more than twice a month is pathological and must be treated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Sufferers often think that taking tonics can cure spermatorrhea. Therefore, they are ineffective and delay treatment, thinking it is incurable, which leads to various symptoms of weakness. This is regrettable.</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease is to first strengthen the sperm, and then use gonadal preparations to replenish the loss, which is hundreds of times better than tonics that do not address the root cause. Himi Tuo's Sperm-strengthening Pills</p>

<p>Years of spermatorrhea cured in one fell swoop!</p>
<p>Patient Xiao Xinyuan had a habit of masturbation in his youth, which led to spermatorrhea. He delayed treatment, and it was never cured. Last autumn, he was introduced to me for diagnosis and treatment by Mr. Gu San [omitted]. I prescribed "Himi Tuo's" sperm-strengthening pills to strengthen his sperm gate, and instructed him to purchase and take the gonadal preparation "Reproduction Element" from the Sino-British Pharmacy. In about a month, the spermatorrhea was eradicated. His body recovered to be strong and healthy. He was like a completely different person before and after.</p>

<p>(1) Underdevelopment and Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Achieved good development and reversed extreme weakness.</p>
<p>Patient Lou Changsheng, 27 years old, from the South City, merchant. Mr. Lou was born weak, and his mother's milk was insufficient in his youth, resulting in poor development during his growth period. He was prone to depression and anxiety, which led to neurasthenia. He became emaciated, listless, and suffered from anemia, loss of appetite, forgetfulness, insomnia, kidney deficiency, back pain, and dizziness. He had been treated many times, but with no full effect. Last autumn, his colleague Mr. Lin Bofang's premature aging was cured by me, so he introduced him to me for treatment. I told him about methods of health preservation and performed electrotherapy to stimulate his nerve center. In terms of medication, I instructed him to purchase and take Staner's "Reproduction Element" from the Taihe Pharmacy. After taking it, his symptoms gradually disappeared. His muscles became full and his spirit was restored. Because Mr. Lou's stomach was weak, I also gave him a large amount of "Stomach-strengthening Element" to strengthen his stomach. Since then, all parts of his body have achieved good development.</p>
<p>(2) Smoking Addiction and Spermatorrhea Eliminated by Medicine</p>
<p>Tried all methods, but this is the most effective. Worthy of praise!</p>
<p>Patient Gu Yulin, 34 years old, local. Not specified. Mr. Gu has been smoking for no less than ten years. At first, Mr. Gu suffered from severe spermatorrhea due to indulgence in wine and women. Repeated treatments were ineffective, causing forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus, and back pain, causing great suffering. He occasionally tried smoking opium at a friend's place, which seemed to invigorate him. After smoking it for a long time, he became addicted. It then turned into numbness. If he didn't smoke, not only would his whole body feel uncomfortable, but also various symptoms would immediately appear. He then realized that smoking could not cure the disease, but only hide and delay it. He repeatedly resolved to quit smoking. He tried various methods, but each time failed because his various symptoms were not alleviated, and it was difficult to quit smoking completely. Last autumn, he was introduced by his peers to me for treatment. I prescribed Himi Tuo's sperm-strengthening pills to treat his spermatorrhea, and instructed him to take Reproduction Element to remove his smoking toxins, break his smoking addiction, treat his weakness, and restore his strength. He praised me repeatedly before leaving.</p>
<p>Note: When purchasing sperm-strengthening pills, be sure to recognize Himi Tuo's, as it is the only effective brand. (Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is located on the second floor of the China Trust Company building on the corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road. Clinic hours are from 10 am to 6 pm, closed on Sundays.</p>

<p>Premature Aging, Frailty, and Multiple Illnesses</p>
<p>Patient Huang Fu [omitted], 36 years old, from Chuzhou, merchant. Mr. Huang was the sole heir to three families, and his parents were eager for grandchildren. He was married at the age of seventeen. He married a total of three wives in four years. Mr. Huang [omitted] in between, his sexual function was damaged as a result, and he suffered from spermatorrhea and kidney atrophy. His form and spirit were [omitted]. His face was haggard. Before reaching the age of forty, he looked like he was nearing the end of his life. Over the years, he suffered from forgetfulness, insomnia, dizziness, tinnitus, back [omitted], body tremors, and cold limbs. He took tonics continuously, but they seemed ineffective. Spermatorrhea and kidney atrophy were the most painful. Although he possessed three beauties, they were only nominally his. Last spring, his fellow villager Mr. Shi, whose underdevelopment was cured by me, introduced him to me for diagnosis and treatment. I observed that his gonads were severely weakened, so I gave him a large amount of "Reproduction Element." I instructed him to purchase and take "Himi Tuo's" sperm-strengthening pills to treat his spermatorrhea. After a month, his symptoms gradually disappeared. His spermatorrhea and kidney atrophy were cured. He looked like he was not yet thirty. Recently, I heard that he has added a child to each of his wives.</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea and Premature Ejaculation, Multiple Symptoms</p>
<p>Patient Liu Mingxin, 29 years old, from Sheng County, laborer. Mr. Qin was born weak and developed relatively late. He also committed the bad habit of early masturbation, which led to spermatorrhea. At first, he had dreams before ejaculating, but later he discharged sperm without dreams. The episodes occurred more than ten times a month. He took medication constantly, but the effect was negligible. After getting married, he developed severe premature ejaculation. Recently, it became more serious, and he was unable to perform his marital duties. He also suffered from insomnia, headaches, tinnitus, back pain, fear of movement, fatigue, palpitations, night sweats, forgetfulness, and a pale face. Multiple symptoms appeared. He felt that he had neurasthenia, which caused him great suffering. Until last summer, he came to me for treatment. I instructed him to purchase and take "Himi Tuo's" sperm-strengthening pills from the Western medicine department of the Wing On Company to strengthen his sperm gate, and instructed him to take "Reproduction Element" to treat his premature ejaculation and weakness. After taking half a dozen, all his symptoms suddenly disappeared.</p>

<p>— Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>This symptom is one of the symptoms of neurasthenia. It is most common in those who are physically weak, those who have imbalances after illness, and the elderly. In our clinic, we often see this symptom occurring with tinnitus, dizziness, fear of movement, and fatigue. If we give them gonadal preparations, they often respond quickly and effectively. This is because this symptom is caused by deficiency of qi and blood and neurasthenia, and gonadal preparations have the effect of tonifying qi and blood and reversing weakness. Therefore, they are particularly effective in treating this symptom and its complications.</p>

<p>Restore Robust Health in a Month!</p>
<p>Patient Zheng Guoxun, 27 years old, local resident, merchant. He was naturally robust. Three years ago, in the autumn, he carelessly contracted typhoid fever. He was almost dead from the illness. Although he was fortunate to recover, he did not take care of himself after the illness, resulting in physical weakness and suffering from symptoms such as nocturnal emission and insomnia. He took many kinds of medicine, but they were ineffective. Last summer, he was introduced to me by his colleague, Mr. Fang. I observed that he was tall and remarkably thin. After examination, I prescribed Himrod's Spermatorrhea Tablets and Reproductive Essence. The nocturnal emission ceased immediately. Within a month, he regained his robust health. Compared to when he first came for consultation, he was almost unrecognizable.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Demands on Dramatists in the National Salvation Movement <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Traveler from Oka</p>
<p>Due to the critical situation in North China, after the call for the national salvation movement was issued from Beiping, the cultural city that is the "hometown of the May Fourth Movement," it immediately received a strong response from the people of various regions. The citizens of Shanghai quickly organized national salvation groups. People from the cultural world, women, elementary school teachers, nurses, ... to people from various professional circles, all rose up to participate in this determined national salvation action, tragically demonstrating that the national spirit of China has not yet subsided, and moreover, it will never subside. Chinese people, except for traitors and national sellouts, none want to be slaves of a conquered nation, watching as our territory is lost, whether directly or indirectly (in disguise)! Therefore, despite the current "good neighborly relations" and various difficulties, the sentiment of the popular national salvation movement is still rising day by day, more fervent than any period since the September 18th Incident!</p>
<p>In this urgent situation, in the rising cry for national salvation, the cultural world, which has always stood at the forefront of the times, should stand even further ahead of the masses and shoulder the task of the national salvation movement. However, judging from the current situation, the people of the cultural world have clearly not fulfilled their responsibilities. As the declaration of the Shanghai Cultural Circles National Salvation Association says: "... Teachers at all levels across the country have not stood in front of the students and taken on the responsibility of leading students to save the nation; people engaged in journalism are still concealing reality and reversing right and wrong under the news censorship system, and have not stood in front of the masses and taken on the leadership of public opinion; magazine editors and writers have not done their best to use their conscience and their pens to speak for the masses and guide their actions; others, such as workers in publishing, drama, film, and other departments, have also failed to fulfill their duties within their respective fields. This cannot but be said to be our shame." Indeed, our cultural people should immediately wash away these shames and immediately take on our urgent tasks. Therefore, here, I should mention the drama department and the dramatists engaged in theatrical activities.</p>
<p>Last year's theatrical activity was very active, and therefore, last year was worthy of being called the "year of drama." Judging from the situation at the beginning of this year, the theatrical activity this year will generally not be lower than last year. However, this year is a year of crisis, and theatrical performances must seize the current urgent situation. At the end of last year, I said in "Talks": "If we do not want to be conquered and do not want to be slaves of a conquered nation, then drama can be said to be a powerful weapon for us in the national independence and liberation movement!" However, current dramatists have not actively used this powerful weapon, which cannot but be said to be our shame. From the newspapers, we vaguely hear news of students in Beiping going to the countryside to conduct propaganda, and some people are putting on some anti-imperialist dramas with rudimentary conditions. The students are not professional dramatists, but they can seize the current situation to do drama. On the other hand, looking back at the Shanghai dramatists who are professional, they have not actively stirred up their energy, and some even perform some unimportant plays. This really makes us feel great sorrow! And feel boundless shame! ...</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, anti-imperialist drama was active for a period of time. The current situation is much more critical than the September 18th Incident, but why have the dramatists become silent instead? In order to save our country, save our nation, and make the Chinese masses the masters of their own country; we demand that dramatists unite together in the united front of the national salvation movement, regardless of the form of the play, regardless of the faction, ... all should unite to perform anti-imperialist national salvation dramas, so that the Chinese masses can see the roar of our nation on the stage, arouse the enthusiasm for national salvation, and promote the development of the entire national salvation movement. - On the stage, let us shout: "Roar, China!"</p>
<h3 id="e216">Between Profession and Unemployment <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>When I learned that Junyi was going to be sent to Qingjiangpu, my colleagues and I held a final gathering in a restaurant. Junyi was unusually excited and drank an excessive amount of wine. He said, "This is really unexpected, but I feel this responsibility is too great. For twenty-five years, I have not left Shanghai a single step. Now I am going to the strange northern region alone. I don't know how to deal with those cunning merchants?" But he continued, "This is a broad road in front of me, I must work hard!"</p>
<p>Junyi was one of the most congenial among our graduating classmates. After graduation, he was recommended by his uncle to work in a compradore's office in a foreign firm. The compradore was a close friend of his uncle, and the condition for the recommendation was to learn, so Junyi did not have a fixed title in the compradore's office: whenever the compradore thought of something that needed him to do, he would order him to do it. Naturally, many things went beyond the scope of a general employee. Junyi was very dissatisfied with this "errand boy" position. He thought that the compradore was not sincere in accommodating him, but was relying on his uncle.</p>
