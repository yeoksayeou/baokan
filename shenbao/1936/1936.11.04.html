<p>— 孫懷仁</p>
<p>從中國的歲入上而論，財政的不能平衡，似乎巳成為了一種不治之癌。在這裏，要把這癌能除出，不外只有兩種手段，一種是從歲入上想法，把漸减傾向的租稅收入，能够轉變為漸增；還有一種，就是從歲出方面，看有沒有辦法節流。假若這兩種手段都歸失敗，那末，中國財政經濟的前途，也就非常悲觀了。</p>
<p>這裏，先討論歲入方面改良的可能性。</p>
<p>在我們前面那些就財政以論財政的叙述中，租稅收入的情形，實在是每况愈下，今後要想改變這種情形，當然應該是先從改善租稅的根源—國民經濟—入手。一般對於法幣政策抱着樂觀的人們，它們以為要改善租稅的根源，法幣政策可以負起這個責任來的。它們以為法幣政策實施以後，中國的幣値已有二五％左右的降低，這幣値貶低的結果，物價可以抬高。於是中國大部分的農民，可以因物價的抬高，而使它們的農產品，賣得起錢，結果使它們的購買力也得以加大了。另一方面因為中國幣値减低的結果，外來的洋貨可以减少輸入，民族工業得以乘機勃與，工商階級的繁榮，指日可待，又中國的出口貨物，也可以　幣値减低而趨旺盛。這種種幣値减低後的效果，可以使整個中國的國民經濟繁榮，從而使稅收可以漸增，而財政收支的不平衡，亦可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>這些理論是否全屬事實，我們姑置不論，但這裏顯然就發生了一個矛盾，這就是洋貨入口縱令能因幣値貶低而减少，那末，關稅的收入當然也因而减少，試問建築在關稅基礎上的中國財政，還有辦法沒有？許多的國債將無法抵償，收支將如何平衡？至於說徉貨减少入口而民族工業可以與旺，這也是事實上所不可能的，因為國際間資金的流動，是向着幣値落的國家跑的，各國貨物的輸入縱今减少，外資的流入恐將增加，於是運用其在華就地設廠之權利，猛力進攻，到那時候，民族工業不僅不會興盛，恐將無有瞧類。有許多人，最近拿着中央銀行所編生產指數的向上，（二十四年平均為一〇二·一，本年六月為一〇五·七），來證明工業的繁榮。這種論調是絕對錯誤的，要知道中央銀行的生產指數，是根據統稅署的材料來編製的，因此，牠裏面大部分是外商廠家的生產，而不是所謂民族工業。具體的把各種生產指數分析起來看，更可以知道指數漲得最高的是啤酒（二四年平均為一〇一·一，本年六月為二一三·九），　漲上一一二·八％，指數不但不漲而反下降的是麥粉（二四年平均為一一三·五，本年六月為八二·四）計降下三一·一％，這就因為啤酒大部分是外商，而麥粉差不多是華商。這樣生產指數又何嘗吿訴我們民族工業是旺盛呢？</p>
<p>而且在事實上，中國的進口貨大概都是些必需品，幣値减低也不一定可以杜絕其輸入的。關於這一點，最近也有人在指出，說本年六個月來入口僅四萬六千萬元，比去年同期减一五·九％，出口為三萬三千萬元，比去年同期增加二八·三％，因此說法幣政策是奏效了。但這樣機械的應用統計數字，是非常危險的，年來華北數萬萬元的走私，難道我們因為牠不入統計，而就可以不認為是中國的輸入貨嗎？至於出口貨的加增，我們也應該把牠的內容來分析一下的，大概是些中國特產的軍需原料品，或者是一些海外市塲上突然增加了需要的商品，很少是由於幣値减低的關係的。</p>
<p>最後，我們要檢肘一下法幣政策對於農村的有利程度是如何。法幣政策樂觀者，以為對於農村第一個好的結果，是可以使農產物價抬高。這一點，確是不能否認，下面就是幣制改革前後的幾種農產物指數的比較：</p>
<p>二十四年九月　二十五年九月</p>
<p>上海農產物批發物價指數　七二·二七　八八·五七（七月）</p>
<p>上海輸出農產物價指數　七四·五〇　一二·二〇</p>
<p>上海輸入農產物價指數　一二·一〇　一三七·二　〇</p>
<p>從這個指數看來，農產物價格的確是上漲　了，但這些畢竟只是個都市中的價格，比較農村中的出售價格，要高出許多。據中央農業試騐所的調查，譬如浙江各縣生產地與消費地的米價相差，就常在二元之譜。其餘交通更不方便的內地，其差額當然更大。因此，都市農產品百分之二十餘的上漲，所影響及於農村的農產物價，恐怕是微不足道了。而且我們還更可注意的，就是農產品物價輸入指數，尙遠在輸出物價指數以上。此外，輸入物價指數中的生產品消費品的指數，大致也與農產品呈同一之傾向，所以，農民在農產物價漲上得到的好處，大致都巳與其消費品價騰上所受的損失相殺，很難講有如何改善</p>
<p>從這些分析的結果，可知法幣政策所能改善國民經濟的力量，决不能把牠有一個過大的評價，最近國民經濟旣難有顯著的改善之希望，那末，財政上租稅的收入，不但不能有增大的希望，恐怕稅收漸减之傾向，也是很難以阻止的吧。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c48">黑衫首相的狂吼 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>本月一日意大利黑衫首相在米蘭城的怒吼。簡直震動了每個歐人的心弦。這個演說對於歐洲政局的重要性。不僅是因為它本身包含着許多的要點。而且是因為它表明了法西斯集團對外政策的新動向。原來黑衫首相的演說。係在意德談話後發表。所以從意火利的態度中。也可以看出德國的態度來。換一句話說。墨索里尼的演說。實為德意談話結果的表露。這樣一個含有重大意義的宣言。對於今後歐洲政局的發展。當有極大的影響。那是不用說的。</p>
<p>黑衫首相的演說。除了內政的一部外。關於對外方而所涉及的範圍。是很廣泛而非常重要的。墨氏首先攻擊和平主義考的幻想。如裁軍會議。國際聯盟與集體和平制度。接着說明意國對於英法多腦河流域各國以及共產主義的態度。關於德意談話的結果。允認為歐洲各國合作的基礎。我們現在就其中的幾個要點來分析一下。藉以推測此後法西斯集團的外交動向與國際政局的關係。</p>
<p>先就墨氏所攻擊之和平主義的「幻想」來說。在帝國主義的世界中。要謀軍縮的成功與組成眞正能够維持和平的國際聯盟本是一種幻想不易得到很大的成功。可是我們知道在濃厚的火藥氣世界中。集體安全制度。比較地說。尙不失為一種維持和平的實際辦法。而且這種幻想的破滅。也得由侵略的國家。如意德日本等國負大部的責任。現在墨氏一手持刀殺死病人。而一面却對人說。這個病人本是要死的。還怪診治他的醫生多事。這眞是太不成邏輯了。</p>
<p>由於墨氏的攻擊和平的「幻想」。它自然也必定要反對法蘇因為法蘇。是擁護集體和平與國聯最力的國家。墨氏說羅馬協定後的法意關係。本是非常密切的。但自法國堅持國聯的對意制裁後。它就不得不採取報復的態度。而對於蘇聯的共產主義。現在墨氏也要重新恢復其初期的反對運動。這都顯然的表明德意談話的結果。意國是更採取德國之仇法反蘇聯的政策了。</p>
<p>其次。就關於多腦河流域的國家說。奧匈二國自從三國議定書成立後。本在羅馬勢力的影響下。不過這决墨氏的特別贊助匈國修改和約。收回失地並在最近的將來有以滿足之。這樣顯明的表示。實為以前所罕見。而為對於小協的國的直接進攻。難怪在羅馬尼亞與捷克國內。要引起極大的反響了。但最奇怪的。却是意國與南斯拉夫的關係。墨氏表明有改善的可能。我們都知道意南與匈南的衝突。在過去十餘年中。本是非常嚴重。的而現在墨氏却說可建立友好的關係。這顯然表明墨氏想拉攏南斯拉夫。而拆散小協的國的團結。因為南斯拉夫向來反對共產主義甚力。至今尙未承認蘇聯。因此就不免引起意國的妄想。意國此種對多腦河國家的急進政策。必然會增重中歐政局的糾紛的。</p>
<p>再次。意國的對英政策。以後恐將有重大改變的可能。自從東非戰爭以後。英意衝突的嚴重。是誰也知道的。但在這决墨氏的演說中。他雖然很堅决的表示。英國如不尊重意國在地中海的利益與地位。那末意國甚至不惜一戰。但在骨子裏。墨氏却流露出與英妥協的意思。因此泰晤士報說。「英國對於墨氏之亟於改善英意兩國間關係。極表威激。」而每日郵報更說。「英國對於墨氏此種坦率及表示好感之演說。自當立卽予以反響。」其他各報也有相似的批評。由此可以看出以後意國的對英政策。實將有很大的改變改變的原因。大部是由於意德談話的結果。因為德國為應付和平陣綫起見。亟想拉攏英國。使他不致傾向到法蘇方面去。最近德意之贊成提早召開羅加諾會議就是一個旁證。</p>
<p>墨氏的演說。涉到歐洲所有的重要問題。而獨於最嚴重的西班牙戰事。却一句也沒有說到。這是非常可注意的。也許德意兩國的談話。對於這事還沒有獲得妥協的結果。不過我們就墨氏的演說分析。已可决定意德兩國的關係。已較前更為密切。而法西斯陣綫的團結。也比前有更進一步的發展。這於歐洲以至世界和平的威脅。當然是非常嚴重的。</p>

<p>路透社倫敦通訊　英國足球總會大會中之一大驚人事件、為英國足球隊、在柏林慘敗之報吿書、報吿書中力言、英國式之比賽方法、與其他國家比較、並不佔優、W式陣式、並不能得歐洲大多數國家之同情、</p>
<p>此報吿書由華拉福白朗及勞斯兩人簽具、十分明晰表示、在大多數英國職員之意見、奧地利挪威波蘭所採取之方法、較英國更收效力、</p>
<p>報吿書中稱、概括言之、舊方法以攻重於守為目標、證明更為得力、觀賽當然亦更有興趣、英國職業隊傳說將於本季回復至從前在長久時期中所得之足球方式、有相當之理由可以相信、當初改變之時、全因適應越位規則改變後之環境、如果確係如此、英國國際足球比賽之結果、必隨之而進步、此次英國高級足球職員與國際足球協會在柏林商議　於國際足球管理上所發生之各點、咸認為一嚴重事實、因此或可使英國足球總會重返國際足球協會、目下雙方僅成立一關於掉換球員之「君子協定」、英國足球總會大會之另一結果、為發表一關於巡邊員及裁判員之修正備忘錄、中有如何工作之淸晰指示、裁判委員會所贊成之「斜對角」制卽為使裁判員常可得知其助手之位置、此三職員中、應有極完密之台作、</p>
<p>對於裁判之指示</p>
<p>備忘錄中、將裁判昌對於球員之管理、作成幾點重要結論、特殊之指示如下、</p>
<p>（一）裁判員關於粗暴行動可極對自行斟酌處理、並授權以各種方法使之中止、</p>
<p>（二）在球員受警吿時、球員之姓名及「警吿」兩字必須同時並用、並使球員理會此為其最後之機會、</p>
<p>（三）裁判員於警吿或以言語警吿時、不可以手指或以手放在任何球員身上、</p>
<p>（四）裁判員必須於最初卽制止粗暴行為、</p>
<p>（五）裁剁員必須處罰有意之行為、無意者不罰、</p>
<p>（六）發表裁决後、裁判員不可更改、如有疑問、應於發表裁决前、商諸巡邊員、</p>
<p>（七）球員不可阻礙裁判員之判决、如有阻礙或表示怒意者、必須警吿之、</p>
<p>（八）裁判員在球塲中不可與球員或職員商討或辯論事件、在塲外亦不可與任何球員有所商討或辯論、</p>
<p>（九）對於犯規方面有利之任何處罰、不可使之實現、備忘錄之特別注意「枉費時間」之比賽方法、此與比賽精神完全相對、巳成為可注意者、</p>
<p>在任意球及擲球入界時、球員將球野踢、使其本隊得回復其位置、而監視其對方選手、此種習慣、備忘錄認為幼稚與可惱、並請裁判員堅决處置此等違反足球運動員精神之行動、</p>

<p>連環圖畫為最普遍之民間讀物、尤以上海一埠發行者最多、惟內容大都為神怪小說、對推行社敎頗有影響、敎部現正設法改善、茲探錄各情如次、</p>
<p>出版種類　連環圖畫之內容、大部份係參照舊小說、使其簡單化、通俗化、趣味化文圖各半、間有將社會上臨時發生之新聞事件編成者、所有內容以神怪傳奇佔多數、如七劍十三俠、荒江女俠、火燒紅蓮寺等名目繁多、至侮淫作品比較罕見、以閱讀對象為兒童與粗識文字之成化、俠義小說較能吸引也、</p>
<p>鶯業概况　發行連環圖畫之書店、市內不下百餘家、而大部份均開設於閘北蒙古路北公益里一帶、該處已達八九十家之多、餘如九畝地亦有數家、　馬路則僅有一家、粽計出版種類共八九百種、每種自一部至十餘部不等、銷路外埠批發甚盛、而以北方為多、市內販買者均係各里巷之書擴、用以粗給附近居戶之，童閱讀、最低之代價平均每部七分至一角、</p>
<p>影響甚大　連環雖不受一般智識份子之注意、但在低級社會與兒童間之勢力甚大、以其通俗簡單趣味、故幾無里無之、而商店工廠學徒之租閱是項讀物者尤夥、惟以其內容神怪傳奇、使兒童思想為之改變、較神怪影片之效力並不見遜、實為最普遍之民衆讀物、</p>
<p>設法改善　敎界人士以連環圖畫為推行社敎之利器、故予以改良出版者、近年來已有數種、如上海社會敎育社及兒童書局等、均有改良之連環圖畫出版、近聞敎部方面對此亦頗注意、正在籌議改編云，</p>

<p>中外文化協會、於日前舉行交誼大會、特請新自歐美考察歸來之陶百川氏演講「怎樣復興中國文化、紀錄其演詞如下、</p>
<p>考察國外文化　有二點堪注意在發起中外文化協會之前、我已參加文化建設協會、當時有十敎授提倡本位文化、究竟什麼是中國的本位文化、其實質與定義雖沒有確定、然一時很引起各界、的注意、後來我出國考察國外文化、有二點値得注意、（一）注意人民生活、（二）確定經濟基礎、各國對於人民生活都很注意在蘇聯尤其顯明、他們特別注意兒童·婦女·和勞働大衆的生活、托兒所和幼稚園到處可以看到、德國人民的民族性趨向於尙武精神、鐵血主義、有這樣的民族才有這樣的德國、所以要提倡復興中國文化應該如何着手、我認為除了政治經濟以外、須在人民生活方面去探討和求出結論、因為政治經濟以及人民的衣食住行、都是搆成文化的原素、中國人民的體格和精神是否適應現代的世界、在左石兩種勢力激蕩之下、我們的民族是否能站住脚跟、我們能挽已倒的在瀾、救垂亡的國家、全國我仍能否努力改善我們的生活、</p>
<p>提倡文化必先　研究人的生活</p>
<p>人民生活應努力的對象是一切制度·文物·典章·文化固然可以影響人的生活、然而究竟文化是人造出來的、所以要提倡文化、必先研究人的生活、我考察各國後的感想是應該、（一）促進人民的健康、不和別人比較還不能發現我們幣病、這次世界運動會的結果與乎鬥爭經過、可見中國人民非從健康上着手不能求生存、以足球而論、我們選手失敗是由於體力之不能持久、所以我們必定要在政治經濟以外、在生活上努力求體格的健康、才會有出路、若中國人民不在健康上改進不必人家來侵略、已足亡國、（二）培養人民鬥爭的精神、世界運動會中我們足球的失敗、由於體力不足、而籃球的失敗、是由於鬥爭精神的不移、當抽籤抽到先與日本比賽、選手精神頓為一挫、結果竟是矣失敗、我國的籃球隊以前曾經和美國的籃球隊比賽成續很好、這次因心理的失敗形成事實的失敗、回國後看到外交情形有同樣的感想、我會經和救國會中的沈鈞儒李公樸等談話、他們認救國會的目的在促成抗人、但是還有問題政府還沒有準備就緒以前、不能促成抗人、但得培養抗人的精神、猶太人之所以不能復國、固然是民族沒有鬥爭的精神、德國靑年都穿制服、各人都佩有一把刀到處縣掛文武名人的像片、也都佩有寳劍的、蘇聯對於兒童的訓練也很注重培養鬥爭的精神、一切事都是人為的、國家是人建設的、所以國家的文化就是人民的生活、</p>
<p>發揚一國文化　應該注意經濟</p>
<p>第一點我們應該注意的是經濟、是一切一切的基礎、政治敎育都為上層、經濟則是下層基礎、改變或發揚一國的文化都要　經濟、蘇聯的確是一個新的社會、不管反對她的贊成她的都不能否認他們有新的建設、他們有廚房工廠專鬥造飯做菜、要婦女從廚房跑到工廠、農塲必先解除她們家庭中的廚房工作、婦女工畢以後、就可是到廚房工廠買到熟食、蘇聯家庭、現在已無廚房婦女生產時有四個月的假期、輕工也有三日假期、小孩滿了二僩月、就能送到託兒所、託兒所收容小孩分二月以上、五月以上、一歲以上、二歲以上的幾等、滿了三歲就到幼稚園去、婦女從家庭解放出來、就可以供獻她們的勞力於社會、中國要復興民族發揚文化、非從人民生活、國民經濟上改良不能達到目的、人民生活逐漸改良、國民經濟逐漸建設、文化即在其中、我們不必學別國的左傾、也不必效別國的右傾、國民黨雖然有軍政和訓政的時期、然而要趣向於憲政的、</p>

<p>德俄問題</p>
<p>記老繼更叩以德俄問題、兩國問互事攻擊、情形似甚緊張、陶使謂、外問關於德俄兩國種種傳說、均不足置信、不過德國為共產主義之仇敵、德國反對共產、反對布爾希維克、德俄兩國問、初無其他政治問題也、</p>

<p>不認偽滿</p>
<p>日前報載哈瓦斯電稱、德國前與偽「滿」所訂黃荳協定、近因鑒於由滿輸入德國激增、而德國對偽輸出反减、頗為失望、記者特再舉此向陶使叩詢、陶使對此不願有所表示、嗣談及德國决不承認偽「滿」、謂德國之態度、一切如前、不予變更、新聲社記者末叩以德國重返國聯間題、陶使笑未置答、歡然而散、</p>

<p>（三）醬油之種類及其製法－醬油有雙套，套油，母油，頂油四種，其區別之點在於質地之優劣，普通以一斤豆瓣醬僅製醬油一斤者為雙套，以一斤豆瓣醬製醬油一斤半者為套油，一斤豆瓣醬製成二斤醬油者為母油，至頂油則幾完全以醬滓製成。至於製造醬油之方法，極其簡單，卽將豆瓣醬貯滿於布袋內，並將袋口紥緊，然後以木榨榨取其油汁，遂成醬油，按前所述醬油，質地當以雙套為最佳，套油母油次之，預油最劣，味常鹹苦，若干醬園為圖利起見，常將凈糖（為大麥芽所製）滲入劣等醬油中以解鹹苦，俾得高價出售，此吾人所應注意也。</p>
<p>醬油種類除上述種外尙有鎭江，揚州各醬園所出之秋油，其最佳者稱為三伏秋油，緣鎭江揚州各醬園注重製造醬菜，將蔬菜蘿葡等，雜置醬內，其醬菜之陳醬，每當伏天，必如製新醬然，再加晒露，從此種再度晒露陳醬中逼出之醬汁，經布袋濾過後卽為伏油，倘該類陳醬已經三個伏天之晒露，則所得之醬油，卽為三伏秋油，其味之鮮美異乎尋常，原因醬之原料，固已鮮美，再加各種蔬瓜之鮮味，滲透於醬內，遂更可口。此外市上尙有所謂醬油精，及某某鮮汁者，其中頗有優劣之不同。一種係規模較大之調味粉廠於製造味粉時所附帶製造，以其係利用麵粉製就麵筋，再用鹽酸等藥品之腐爛，並經過化學作用，將其中之毒質提凈，然後乃成醬油精，故味鮮而無毒。另一種係營利之徒，以低價購製造味粉後所餘之麥渣，再將其中殘汁提出製造而成，故往往含有幾　毒質，不宜衛生。但此種劣醬油精因其售價甚微，反能風行市上，此吾人所不得不加鑑別者也。</p>

<p>品評國貨，不是僅憑表面，必須研究內容和種種的關係，而後可以得確切的結果。</p>
<p>第一應根據前工商部頒布七等國貨的原則，來作品評的基礎。</p>
<p>第二應研究製作的技術是否已臻改進的地步？</p>
<p>第三應比較以前的出品，究竟進步了多少，改善到怎樣？</p>
<p>第四應研究所用的原料，是否採自國產？倘使不是的話，是否是的確沒有國產？</p>
<p>第五應研究這種出品，在社會上需要的價値怎樣？於社會有什麽好處？</p>
<p>第六應研究這種出品，與同樣的外貨比較，是否比外貨為價廉物美？是否足以抵制外貨？</p>
<p>第七應研究這種出品的供給量怎樣？過於不及，都　有研究的地方。</p>
<p>第八應研究這種出品，已否達於標準化？能够伴伴如此，個個一樣。</p>

<p>— 梁桐芳</p>
<p>每年海關冊的報吿，終有十多萬萬的金錢外溢，這巨太的漏巵，無疑的，是我們的致命傷，在這十多萬萬元的漏卮中，外貨鉛筆侵奪我們的金錢，也佔到二三百萬元，區區的一枝鉛筆所費，尙能積到這樣驚人的巨數，母怪外貨的侵入，勵輒幾千萬幾百萬了。</p>
<p>在外貨鉛筆很猖獗地暢銷在我們的市塲之際，國貨中國鉛筆廠在民國二十三年七月間創辦了，所出的各種國貨鉛筆較之外貨鉛筆的精美實用，有後來居上之勢。</p>
<p>中國鉛筆廠是由吳羹恤先生發起創辦的，資本五萬元，吳君是一位著名的工業家，以前曾留學日本，研究製造鉛筆，現任該廠協理兼廠長，經理是章偉士先生。</p>
<p>上月二十二日上午特赴打浦橋斜徐路二七六號該廠訪問，承吳君親自接見，據談該廠現分製心木工，成品三部，計有工人五十多人，對於所製鉛筆原料，在可能範圍內，儘量採用國貨，例如粘土採自宜興，筆鉛購自鎭江，木材除普通用鉛筆採用冀·魯·贛·鄂·諸省，所產楊木外，優良者因環境所限，不得不購用美國貨，全部機器均為吳君設計，由順昌鐵工廠承迭，牛皮膠採用上海熾泰製膠廠出品，酒精採用中國酒精廠出品，他如油漆等類，則向國華工業原料公司採購，因此本廠所出貨品，幾可說完全採用國產原料製成，本廠出品，以鼎脾·飛機牌·航空救國·小學生等為商標，除製造普通黑鉛筆外，還製造各種高級鉛筆，繪圖鉛筆，紅藍鉛筆，拷貝鉛筆，蠟筆等，每日可出二百五十籮，（每籮十二打，批發價格每籮自一元二角至七元五角）銷售區域，遍達全國，甚至南洋羣島，暹羅等地，也有本廠出品的足跡，每年營業總額約在二十萬元左右，一方面果然因為本廠對於出品方面力求精美，他方面承各界熱烈愛護，採用國貨，可以阻塞不少漏卮云。</p>
<p>旋由吳君領導參觀該廠工塲製造鉛筆的程序，是先將粘土淘洗，去其濟滓，而後與筆鉛粉混和，經過烘乾手續後，軋成薄片，待其堅硬後，製成鉛棒，再用鉛心機製成與鉛心一般粗細，而後將鉛心置瓦罐內，放爐中一度烘乾，將鉛心的兩頭切成規定的長短，這是製成鉛心的工作，製板部份，是將小木塊先用挖槽機挖成置鉛心的槽條，將筆鉛置在槽中，再用其他木板，用膠水覆粘堅牢，使用機器切成圓形或六角形，並將兩頭長短不齊的切齊，而加以磨光，然後再置於揩漆機，經數度的揩漆，再經打印和包紮手續後，始吿成功。</p>
<p>該廠對於機器設備方面，十分完善，而對於工人的福利事業，也很注意，例如廠內特設有巨力的風箱，吸收工塲內的塵埃和木屑；從事粉末工人的工人，部戴有風鏡和嘴套；機器齒輪和高速度的鋸刀鉋刀，都蓋有護網或錢蓋，以防危險，對於工人敎育方面，更特別注意，設有工徒補習學校和勞工識字學校等，敎育工徒女工，宿舍中又備有書報雜誌等，其他關於安全設備，衛生設備，運動設備，醫藥設備，莫不盡善盡美，該廠創立約期限雖然很短促，但能以微薄的資力，改良出品，與外貨競爭，而佔得相當勢力，那種埋頭苦幹的精神與注意工人福利事業，値得景仰的。</p>

<p>元絲新近因到貨稀少實銷暢旺、故市象非常良好、行情每擔開六元三四角、　　又吐二三角之譜、但建築幫及四漢口等　　紛給　　、因供求失衡、致趨勢愈形挺秀、昨　　　六元五角者、查市上現貨殊覺寥少、是以後市情形、甚為樂觀云、</p>

<h3 id="c209">理論研究　淋病學說之最新革命 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 日本帝國醫科大學畢業陳敏伯醫師</p>
<p>，……局所的療法有利尿清濁之效……方法漸趨完密　……全身淋毒之抗除則有最新的……非特異性療法</p>
<p>淋病因自昔向無特效療法，故被視爲一種難治之病，而「無藥愈淋」之聲，遂盛囂塵上。其實此乃十九世紀之迷信，蓋科學不發達時之必有反響耳。</p>
<p>人類社會自進入二十世紀以來，循科學的猛進，凡百事物皆得而用科學管理，此在醫學界尤爲明瞭。觀於以往一切療法之漸次革新，漸趨完密，足證吾人類居此二十世紀，已能全完享受科學光輝之溫煦，其幸福殆有非舊來之病家所能夢見者矣！</p>
<p>居文明異彩特效之今日，淋病學說乃有一最大的革命事實呈現於吾人目前，一反其舊日迂緩不當之療法，而以嶄新的面目特樹立於治療界，此淋病醫學界今日最大之收效也。</p>
<p>震驚世界之非特異性療法Unse　Pecifische之創立是也！查此種療法之根據，乃以蛋白體施之於接種後之淋病動物，而抽出其動物體內之抗淋素，以行血清治療。故亦名之曰蛋白體療法！其收果之確實與迅速，爲任何方法所望塵莫及也。</p>
<p>根據此種學理，而取經接種動物體內之蛋白體作愛似水仙</p>
<p>內服製劑，則尤爲難能可貴之事實！蓋如是既省卻注射之煩，又便於男女病人在家自療。法固至善，且又流弊絕無，此種內服淋齊，是即蛋白體黃色素合製劑之「克淋儂」是也！本劑之有效作用，即在此蛋白體所具「非特異性」，於服後振奮人體全身細胞機能，使發生強大之</p>
<p>猛力撲菌作用，務使全身各部深微組織內之淋菌，一掃無餘。一方亢進赤白血球之活力，充實全身之抵抗，而免淋毒之後，發生虛弱之骨痛及關節炎。一方又能糾正精囊及睾丸因淋毒而生之炎症，故本藥服後，睾丸腫硬！又如淋病攝護腺炎，婦女因丈夫淋病而受傳染之子宮炎</p>
<p>赤白帶下服此藥尤具偉異效力，不過婦女白帶最好須同時外用「卡而地地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，每晚納入陰道內一二片，凈垢清除，即可迅速恢復清潔！</p>
<p>像「克淋儂」這樣的蛋白體療法，眞可說是二十世紀最有成效的科學結晶品啊！</p>
<h3 id="c210">適應的醫治　失眠症與記憶力消失之由來 <a href="#c210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>……與性神經衰弱有相互關係　……先要解剖此症之本因……</p>
<p>失眠症與記憶力的消失，神經衰弱最顯明的症象，牠的原因很多，變症也是百出。此症大多見於沒有發育完全的青年，原因是手淫中傷，或房勞過度，把產生荷爾蒙的青春腺弄壞了。更因了手淫關係，腦神經也大受震刺，漫漫的把神經衰弱下來了。所以就有失眠和記憶力薄弱的症象，這是在腦神經衰弱的表現。又因了青春腺的斷喪，所以性器官不能如常發發育，矮小異常，幾如幼童，且有遺精，滑精，陰莖勃起力不堅等性神經衰弱之症。此種症候，往往和神經衰弱，有相互的關係。所以性神經衰弱症象加重，那末失眠和記乙力消失，必更度的深刻，我們應該連帶去醫治牠，不可分開來個別治療。</p>
<p>那麽我們應該作如何適應的醫治。這問題我們當然從根本上去著想，服就是要補給己損失的荷爾蒙而具此功效的以「補體康」最具此卓特效力。因俏此劑，是用活潑壯健的動物荷爾蒙，以科學的方法，提製而成，對於神經衰弱，有特殊功能。因此其有旺盛內分泌機能，尤其是性腺的機能有徹底改造之效。服後在短期內，此「補體康」即由血液的輔送各部，不僅有促性器官之發育，性神經的健全。並能把肌肉充實起來，一切的新陳代謝機能加速，凡是陳腐的物質，都能盡量排除。於是精神振奮，記憶力增加，又因腦神經得到荷爾蒙補充影響，所以也能調整而強壯起來。於是失眠和記憶力的消失，都完全治愈了。至於遺精，那可與「耐而斯遺精片」同服，自可同時治愈。這是我從俄國勞働大學醫科畢業後，在臨床上所得到的，有數千人都服此藥而愈。</p>

<p>陰萎短小……伉儷勃谿</p>
<p>韓福田君，年二十九。銀行界。（病原）——年少時，因受淫書之毒，致罹手淫，濫用生殖器，致摧毀性能，阻礙發育。（症狀）——於民廿年結婚，因不節房事，腎元大傷，漸覺精神萎頓，思想鈍滯，記憶力減。而夫婦樂趣，尤大爲減色，蓋早洩陰萎，毫無能力。性器亦殊短小，伉儷感情，不絕如縷。今春由友人介紹，來余處治療。（診療）——余診爲荷爾蒙機能損傷，性發育阻礙，乃利用最新療法，投服荷爾蒙製劑「補體康」，補育其荷爾蒙，旺盛其發育，一方施以電療，約一月另七天，即獲全部治愈。尤奇者，發育遂增強大，已與常人無異矣！</p>

<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>……面有菜色好象飢餓線上回來之人，　……原因多端而卵巢機能失常爲其主要原因</p>
<p>女子有的艷如桃李，有的慘若菜色，這究竟是何原因。據近頃醫家的所究研結果，知是卵巢機能的健全與否爲斷。因爲卵巢是握女子生殖腺系統最重要的部分，一個身體的健康，多准這一部重要器管而定。假使卵巢機能失云生理的常態，而不能執行排卵的工作，於是月經即起困難，血行障礙，貧血，故玉容憔悴，現委黃狀，而神經亦陷衰弱，如頭痛失眠，精神煩躁，腰酸背痛，白帶涓涓而流，故體益弱而面色益覺萎黃可怕了。對於女性的生育，也要發生了問題，因卵巢是受姙的主要器官，一如男子的睾丸，假如睾有病，自然也不能有精子的製造了。從我於陸軍醫科大畢業之後，凡是遇到了卵巢機能失常而來之婦女萎黃。率用「補女容」一藥服之，以調整卵巢機能，而促新血源源而生，並因荷爾蒙之增多，所以新陳代謝機能也加速，脂肪實充，乳房臀部膨大高聳，臉色嬌嫩，妍態二甲雙胍人。其有白帶患者，則可用，「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，那末萎黃病同白帶，一概可以治愈了。這是最根本而最正確的治療。</p>
<h3 id="c213">最執拗之淋病獲效 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 鄧源和醫師</p>
<p>淋病本一執拗的花柳病，因爲雙球菌的淋菌，牠有善竄和耐冷抗毒的功能，但是在淋病最起的時候，牠的巢穴，也不過在前尿道，最易掃凈根治。若一旦急性淋變爲慢性，牠的巢穴，已不僅在一處了。所以醫治，也較急性時候困難。但是，如果侵入副尿道時，這狡猾的淋菌，更難以擒獲了。凡是淋菌侵入副尿道管時，因爲這管口很細小而且狹長，一經進去，不得出來。患者尿雖與平日無異，也不溷濁，（但往往在早晨初次小便時，見有淋系，在平時用指壓迫龜頭時，也有污濁之淋系擠出）。因此往往傳染妻子，以其不容易顧到的原故。</p>
<p>對於此病，我也曾有遇到，如易大雲君，他是一個網遊而好飲酒的青年，患了淋病以後，依然是過飲無度，且不愼房事，數年以來，不但病沒有好，且反將淋毒傳染他的夫人某女士，但易君之病，並不覺得有何痛苦，也沒有什麽症狀，只不過疲勞之後，尿液溷濁而已。後來我處治療，經了診察結果，知道患的是副尿道炎，即囑其服「克淋儂」使其藥效直接在副尿道管中發生殺菌作用。一方呌他往姚菊巖醫師行電療法後，在五星期中即獲根治了。至於他的夫人淋毒性白帶，也囑服「克淋儂」外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥，先後治療三四星期，也獲根治。因此「克淋儂」一藥，確是根治執拗性的淋病之極適當內服藥，宜其風行中外也。</p>
<h3 id="c214">白帶病之新自療 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>

<p>白帶是婦科中最易遭遇之疾患，病人往往因其普遍而忽之，因而變症百出。最著之症象，爲陰道糜爛，發炎腫痛妨害月經及房事。故有小腹膨脹，而來精神之萎壻，體健之消失等。尤其可慮之後果，厥爲不孕，及兩性愛清之破裂。故不可不亟早從事作根本上之挽救。俾女子幸福不致永遠之消失也。</p>
<p>際此秋高氣爽之候，此種白帶尤宜及時醫治，方不影響冬日之健康。「卡而雪地氏陰道片」一藥，爲近頃極有特效之外用坐藥，由余在臨床上之詳細考究，「卡而雪地氏陰道片」確有防腐止泌消炎殺蓖之效。能在短期內將白帶掃除凈盡。惟如因淋一次而來者可服「克淋儂」，因白帶而引起月經，或月經不調，身體虛弱而來之白帶，可服「補女容」，尤能調經去帶之功。世界各國醫家，莫不推用此藥片也。</p>

<p>尿後見有血滴之淋病</p>
<p>淋毒性之炎症，最易由後逆道侵入內尿道口，而波及於附近之膀胱粘膜。更進而侵入其餘之膀胱部分，因而遂起膀胱炎。患者感到尿意頻數，放尿時疼痛而尿質溷濁，身發高熱，食慾不振，全身違和，其患純急性膀胱炎者，每隔一二小時，而排逆一次，甚至隔二三十分，即小便一次者，故夜不安枕，而釀成失眠之患。痛苦不堪，此外恥骨上部與會陰亦感痛楚，尤其是放散在尿道膀胱炎所經過之尿道或肛門等部分。</p>
<p>然而膀胱炎之痛苦，並不止此。往往在小便之後，繼之以血滴。此血滴稱爲終末性血尿Terminale　Haematurie，所以此症之療治，絕對不可行局療法，如透膜殺菌等淋藥決難奏功。因此等膀胱炎範圍甚大。且淋菌已四散奔走。決難在一處可以殲滅。經余多年來細心考究，知此症非用內服「克淋儂」以振奮全身細胞，俾產生一種抗淋毒素，以喰滅淋菌而奏消炎，退腫，利尿等效。一方輔用長短電波治療，以發揮滅淋之威力。</p>
<p>患者章一鶚君，居青島路。年二十四歲，偶因酒後，遂致失身而染淋毒，以治療不得其法，及誤服劣藥，遂轉成膀胱炎，尿意頻數，日夜小便多至數十次。遂成失眠，且每次尿後見血，其餘會陰恥骨肛門等處，均感痛楚，丐余治療，乃用電波治療外，一方進服「克淋儂」，以殺菌消炎利尿鎭痛，兼以防腐退腫。僅四星期中完全根治。惟因失眠之後，神經不免衰弱，乃囑往中西大藥房購服「補體康」至二星期而愈。迄今飲酒勞動，均無病態。蓋根已三年矣。</p>

<p>切勿妄服戒藥！　必須注意細胞力。</p>
<p>要談到戒煙藥物，眞是談何容易？因爲煙毒並不專門損害人體某一部分，而是全盤破壞人體細胞機能的。戒煙藥物若不能補育全身細胞力，只單獨糾正某一部分，那是駕雲梯取月，相想把煙毒戒除，而且痛苦重重，神經衰弱症必不能免！</p>
<p>據我從南通醫科大學畢業後歷年的研究，認爲戒煙最適當的藥物，要算「補體康」了。服後即可恢復全身細胞力，昂進因煙毒失去之各種組織機能，故一經進服，煙毒清除，體力活潑，精神猛增，而毫無痛苦！戒除後永遠不復重吸，因「補體康」的效力，確能使血液內之煙毒，完全根除也。</p>

<p>諸葛亮的短命　劉姥姥的長壽</p>
<p>凡是看過三國志和紅樓夢的人。都知道諸葛亮的死是由於食少事頃而劉姥姥則因食量大如牛而惹賈府中那些公子和小姐的笑聲。你看一個妙計多端的孔明，竟敵不過蠢如　鹿的劉姥姥的壽命，豈非怪事？其實吃飯也有哲學的。孔明之所以食慾減少，完全用腦過度，影響消化機能，因而營養不足，體弱多病，自然不能長命的。而劉姥姥則吃好飯無所事事，腦子裏一些事也沒有。所以飯量大增。我們固不必學劉姥姥的爲人。但我們要求劉姥姥的健康。那末自然不可服使食慾旺盛的「張胃精」一藥了。因爲此劑有改造消化機能，促加食慾之亢進，凡胃呆，營養不足，胃痛，嘔吐吞酸，飽悶，及因瓦斯擁塞腸道而屁如連珠皆可治愈。又能補給維他命Ｂ而治愈腳氣。總之凡是有胃腸痛和用腦過度而致令慾不振的患者，都可服「強胃精」。這是我從南通醫科大學畢業後經騐過的特效藥。</p>

<p>— 陸軍醫科大學畢業宋忠鈺醫師</p>
<p>……每個青年犯手淫病的　……都有缺少精液之症象</p>
<p>精液是我們生命上最可寶貴的成份，沒有牠不能活，缺少牠病即百出，最顯著的才在十四五歲的青年，因了外界的引誘；及荷爾蒙的剌戟，就釀成手淫的惡習，天天作那自凟的勾當；無限制的把精液損失掉。於是病態就天天出現了。最顯明的，要算發育的不全，及神經衰弱症了，其他因房事過度，也能弄到這種結果。患者精神遲鈍，貧血，消瘦，這是體內缺少內分泌的營養之故。而在青春腺方面，則因機能失常而不能發育，連帶性神經衰弱，如遺精，早洩，勃起力不堅等皆因之而起。他如失眠，心悸，記憶力有顯明的降低。</p>
<p>關於此等因手淫而來之遺精病等治法，由余在陸軍大學畢業後之數十年來之實地經騐，以服「耐而斯遺精片」一藥，功效最著，因爲遺精病多由於性神經脆弱，精關失去控制的力量，所以往往不自主地把精遺失了。「耐而斯遺精片」恰好能鎭攝神經，鞏固精關，很快而且很正常地把遺精病治愈了。與那引起霸烈的劣藥比較起來，眞有天淵之別。這祗要服過該藥片而治愈的人，就完全可以證明了。惟是身體已十分衰弱的。可與「補體康」同服。更易奏功。</p>

<p>— 君美</p>
<p>鬍鬚，在人體上似乎也是一種與觀瞻有關係的東西，像我們林主席的銀髯飄拂，于院長的滿面于思，在在足以表示出他們的慈祥愷悌莊嚴肅穆的神情來，無怪有人以為鬍鬚是雄性美的象徵，在某種塲合，確令人有此感想。</p>
<p>因此鬍鬚有時亦被視為一種工具，在商塲中「老成持重」總比較「浮燥輕佻的能得人信用，拆字先生往往蓄鬚，自亦為此種作用，至於它的樣式，確亦花式多端，一字的，八字的，公字的，也會跟着時代的遷移，而變化着。據說：友邦人士有「鬍鬚會」的組織，因為鬍鬚亦足以表現其民族精神的傾向，而友邦「一字式」的鬚，看上去多少帶一點勇猛，進取，活潑的姿態可見亦非偶然，國人蓄鬚，大多隨其所至，除了靑年人在好奇嘗試以外。</p>
<p>在舊小說上我們往往可以瞧到三綹淸鬚五綹長髯等種種描寫實則亦正如戲班中扮演出來的白的，黑的，灰白的，甚至於紅的，貫串成三角形的一般，在表示其劇中人的忠奸勇怯，同一用意，「後視今猶今視昔，今人初不異前人。」鬍鬚當然也不能例外。</p>
<p>歷史上關於鬍鬚趣話，記不勝記，最近時賢如熊鳳凰之因結婚而剃鬚，褚太極之因振災玩票而剃鬚，一則老去風懷，爭羨艷事，一則急公好義，造福窮黎，其流風餘韻，洵足留為佳話。</p>
<p>里諺有云：「十個麻子九個俏，十個鬍子九個騷。」前者指女子，則不過就其背影而言，後者則竟不知何以蒙此惡名，不能考其始作俑者，意者，鬍子每不能博女子歡，因此不免發洩於「騷吧」，一笑。</p>
<h3 id="c221">野雞 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>「野鷄」，是上海的女人之一種，是一種下等的賣淫婦的代名詞。查野鷄，本來是禽類之一，就是子路攻之，三嗅而作之所謂「雉」是也。所以野鷄一名「雉妓。」但這是文人筆下所用的，若是通俗的說起來，那總是說「野鷄」的。為甚麽這種下等妓女，呌做野鷄？那恐怕翻遍了二十四史，也是找不出其所以然來的。</p>
<p>雖然野鷄是下等妓女的代名詞，但現在在上海，却是很廣泛地被用作形容詞了。凡是不正常的，或是不規則的一切，都冠之以野鷄。例如開着一家舖子，正常的總有若干老主顧，光臨賜顧着。但是在這若干老主顧之外，若有着陌生主顧上門來，這陌生主顧，便被名為野鷄客人。」這在脂粉市塲中，更是普遍。難得來呌一次二次局的，被呼野雞客人。偶然到跳舞塲去買一塊錢舞票，而跳舞的，也是野雞客人之一種。</p>
<p>汽車未曾風行於上海時，最出風頭的，是馬車。馬車是有自備的與出租的二種。而同時呢，却還有一種，是名為自備，實際出租的，這便呌「野雞馬車。」正如現在的「野雞汽車」一樣，雖然捐的是自備汽車的黑牌子照會，實際，是作着白牌子的出租生意的，其作用，僅不過迎合主顧的虛榮心理而已。而更是普遍的，該算是「野雞包車。」有自備人力車之名，而有公用人力車之實。兜攬主顧時，低聲下氣，接取車資時，常得踅進小弄堂，鬼鬼祟祟的，惟恐被巡捕查見，而被吊銷着執照。但是在街上拉走時，坐車者，高坐堂皇，誰能瞧透他所坐的，是野雞包車呢。</p>
<p>說起了野雞，似乎總是有些兒不登大雅，不怎麽會從大人先生的嘴角裏，漏出來的。但是這些年來，野雞二字，竟也逐漸地侵入敎育界了。瞧哪，在這裏儘有着不少租着個二上二下的弄堂屋子，自命為造就靑年的「野雞大學。」在野鷄大學中，只須照章交納着學費，儘不用每天上課，只須挨過了相當的時間，便居然也能戴方帽子。最好笑的，是給人代課的敎授先生，也往往不期然而然的對人說，「我是打打野鷄的。」而學生們對於這種敎授，也總呼之為「野鷄先生。」</p>
<p>野鷄，在上海，是風靡一時的，所以我們這個上海，已不啻是一個「野鷄世界。」</p>

<p>— 拾玫</p>
<p>莫看輕一個包廚－天下無如吃飯難。如果社會上沒有這包廚的行業，那末各機關中的什麼點王，大亨之類，固可坐着包車，回到府上去逍遙大嚼；而那些小職員之類將何以果腹呢！莫看輕一個包廚！要想在機關裏做個廚頭也大非容易。沒有脚力，憑你是個烹調能手，誰來睬你！旣做得成包廚了，對待大亨，小職員甚至工友，也須八面玲瓏，應付得法；不然，當心你的碗盞！</p>
<p>千做萬做，蝕本弗做。做包廚也不外此例，然而這很難言。某校校長的住宅裏，連車夫女傭在內，共有人口十名以上，而包飯只吃三客半，包廚的已經覺得有些說不出的為難了，而為難的還不止此。廚工送客飯，必得先送校長住宅，聽候他宅中選魚揀肉，甚或分取別家的飯菜，以供那十餘人的大嚼。包廚格於上下之分，誰敢吐出一個「不」字，只好把學生的飯食减至無可减，而學生自治會安知之，包廚遂屢受「罰菜」的處分了！</p>
<p>有些機關裏，往往會計先生，庶務先生和廚頭合股幹那包飯的事兒的。也有會計先生鐵面無私，飯費預支，不能通　的。也有庶務先生不但白吃了飯，而逢時逢節，包廚還要備了豐盛的禮物，以酬其照顧之恩的。此中內幕，一言難盡。廚頭因禁不住重重榨取，而中途脫逃的，遂常有所聞。</p>

<p>在沒有開關平門之前，在沒有改建護龍街和觀前街為寬廣的大道之前，閶門正是一個似花如玉的少女，往來如梭的人羣。澈夜不絕的歌聲，誰料想得到他會同蕭煞的秋光一般，這麼憔悴，蒼老，可憐。</p>
<p>只是兜了幾個圈子，看萬千的電燈光，像要抗住了這黑夜的權威，燈光下，更點綴着漂亮的姑娘，不，該說是可憐的女子吧！</p>
<p>伊們逢人拖着，「玩玩去罷！先生！」看伊們臉上塗着厚厚的白粉，嘴唇加上深紅的胭脂，美嗎？我不敢說，我的眼裏祗有憐惜！他們做足着宛轉，淸脆，細膩的　調在呌喊，但　在我聽來祗是人問地獄悽慘的呼聲。</p>

<p>深秋的嬌陽怪嫵媚的在草原上鋪着術好像帶著一點早春的味兒；風，仿佛似一雙多情少婦的纖手，圍過了我的勃子，探進了我的胸膛，使我感覺到無限的舒適與輕快。</p>
<p>一行三個人，在蘊藻浜下了車，沿着那條河濱走去，默默地，大家暫時沉默着，讓鞋底擦着細石子，發出那淸脆的步調，很有節奏地在道靜穆的空氣裏蕩漾着，蕩漾着。轟轟轟！一輛小火車從我們身邊飛了過去，丟下的兩條鐵軌却像兩根墨綫似的在我們面前伸展着，一直伸釗天涯，伸到海角，仲到世界的盡頭。</p>
<p>過了洋橋，河洪裏密密的擠着許多貨船和方頭的划子，岸上也可以看釗一些不整齊的人，和零落的小攤頭；一羣孩子却圍坐在泥地上談些什麼，大家手裏都裏都執着一面小紙旗，樣子倒有點像是在開會。榮向一個攤頭上去買了一些水果和點心，想到河裏去找一隻淸潔點的划子，準備暢游一回河，可是沿着河濱走了好些路，所看到的那幾隻划子太不愜意了。</p>
<p>「船要　，要遊河　！幾個嘶啞的聲音在河裏響著，於是我們回過頭去向那響着　音的地方望，　見幾個老婆子站在划子上對我們招呼。</p>

<h3 id="c227">「王寶川」的流行 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 無次</p>
<p>女人在中國像是一種特殊的人物，要是不能上升天堂，就必墮入地獄。上天堂的，當然有丈夫陪着上跳舞塲，進電影院；而入地獄呢，則大都是做馬牛，或者守活寡。天堂旣不是人人能够上升，地獄又大都不願意進，所以夾在當中的就只得想盡方法去維持她們這個不上不下的地位。</p>
<p>但維持也就很難，譬如經濟吧，那不消說得是要獨立的，而經濟獨立，自　非謀職業不可，有了職業，就是以服務的成績去換取相當的酬謝。有些地方還為了這點，而有婦女社會服務促進會的組織。</p>
<p>北平的婦女界就有這樣的活動。</p>
<p>我們住在上海，對於她們活動的成績，當然無從得知，不過單從報上登載的新聞看來，也可知道一二，如籌備在北京飯店舉行盛大的遊藝會，公演舊劇及話劇，而話劇又决定演英文劇「王寳川」，主角又請定俞姍女士擔任之類。</p>
<p>這新聞引起我們興趣的，自然是「王寳川」了，但也幷不是因為「王寳川」是英文劇，而這劇在倫敦上演的時侯，曾轟動過英國皇室中人去觀光的。我們感覺些微奇異的是像婦女社會服務促進會這樣一個團體竟會演「王寳川」。</p>
<p>這裏，我們得先來解釋「王寳川」所以成功的原因。</p>
<p>外國人的歡迎中國戲，够不上說藝術的欣賞，祗是好奇心的衝動。他們日常所見的戲劇，大抵都是寫實的，如佈景力求富麗，動作務求逼眞，而為了急促的生活，主題的表現，又往往都是最急促的人生的一段，現在看了用馬鞭子當馬騎那種象徵的方法，又看了王寳川與薛平貴的離合悲歡，一鬧就是兩十年，那麽悠閑，那麼羅漫蒂克，自然禁不住要喝起采來！</p>
<p>可是我們欣賞「王寳川」為的是什麼呢？而婦女社會服務促進會這樣的團體排演「王寳川」又為的是什麼呢？</p>
<p>難道像王寳川這樣的人物，還是現代女性心目中崇拜的偶像麼？雖然說以相國女兒之尊去下嫁一個寒士，那正顯出戀愛是不分階級，而平貴投軍一別就是十八年，這十八年之中，王三姐苦守寒窰，心如止水，也正顯出她愛情的堅貞。可是這樣的戀愛是不足為訓的。</p>
<p>王寳川究竟是封建社會的產物，在王寳川時代，一個出嫁的女子如果不能像干寳川那樣守活寡，她會遭受到社會上一切人們的白眼，如果生在現代，卽使在封建勢力還殘存的地方，為了時代的進展，環境也不容許有這樣一個人物</p>
<p>因為，這是超於人性的。</p>
<p>那末，婦女社會服務促進會之出演王寳川，我們除了看出她們是有意無意地，在崇拜這個人物外；就想不到還有其他的意義。二十世紀四十年代的中國，有人以業餘劇人演娜拉為開倒車，其實，娜拉在中國社會中，實在還應該多多給中國婦女們看一看，不然，那些不上不下的女人，委實有被夾死的可能！</p>

<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>——海宴之什</p>
<p>我愛南海的海濱，那在洋的水，廣闊地舖滿了銀似的光芒，這兒是魚蝦所構成的肥腴的廣域，三年前，我旅寄在那兒，那印象多麽深刻地停留在我的腦袋里，如今我們又舊地重遊了。是陰霾的早上我們從廣州來到台城的第三天，我倥惚地踏上穿雲似的長途汽車里，張着美麗鑑賞底眼珠子，望那長蛇似的伸開的山，高高地挿入雲霄的乳峯，望那古舊而幽美地躱在綠林下的村莊，望那澄淸的坑水，雖然三四天來的奔波，沒有睡得滿足，可是，安妮還是張大了兩　靈慧的眼珠子，從窗子望着那迷人的風景，她是住慣城市的人，一旦看到這奇麗的山川，心兒早就輕輕地飄蕩了。這，使我想起了在江南的時候，從火車廂上望見了一片無際的平野，叢密的綠草，到處顯出了那軟弱的文雅的風度，而靠南海的地方呢，却是顯出了高昂的壯麗的山景，也許是，南海和江南的風土人情，跟地理氣候的環境而不同的吧。</p>
<p>坐了兩點半鐘的迅速的長途汽車，到了深井，這兒跟開平陽江交接的境界，也是海宴的一角了，不過，海宴是地廣人富又是山明水秀的偏僻地方，用這個地方來代表是不够的，在好多年以前，賊黨盤居着古兜　的時候，海宴為賊黨擾亂的地方，這深井也曾做過好久的賊窟，想起當年是多麽驚心的，現在，從那組俗的鄉人的輪廓上偷望一下，好像看出他們底地方色彩是非常野蠻的，這交通不便的遠鄉，人民也現出了較原始似的風格來呢。</p>
<p>到海宴街——我們的目的地，還有五十多華里過嶺山路，我的腿本來還可以跑，可是，我不幸的患了三四個月的脚病，安妮也許跑不得多少路，還有行李，所以老鶴呌了三輛轎子，一輛要化二塊五角的白銀，價講好了，那十多個轎夫就你爭我搶的，倒把我的籐篋也扯壞了，雖然跑來跑去要一百華里的山路，費了多少血汗來掙這一點錢，可是，在鄉村里，這個數目倒不是少的，所以爭不倒的那一個轎夫，睜大了憤怒的眼珠子，失望的氣息就壓呀壓的溜出來了</p>
<p>坐轎，我和安妮都是破題兒的第一遭，過去，我的想象里，在未有汽車以前坐轎當然不失為高貴的紳士才有福的，那麽，當然很趣味了，可是，輪到我們來嘗試的時候，所感到的苦味就够難受了。我當然不是一個狹義的人道主義者，但我同情這種勞動者的苦痛，當我看到眼前的一個轎夫那起了胝的肩上皮也給擦破了，一點一點的汗淌下來，掙扎地繞着崎嶇而狹小的山路，或難走的灣曲的阡陌的時候，我的心就壓着什麽似的緊皺起來了。同時，我坐不慣轎子，給結實的木凳子和一起一伏的動盪，不久，我的屁股又痛又難過，氣也透不出來，肺葉在跳舞似的，正像犯人在受着刑罰，我在咒詛：我為什麽要這樣呀！前面的奴隸比我更苦呢！想着，那秀麗的山川，迷人的美景，我冉沒心悄去賞了。</p>
<p>轎到了殺水關，我們就落轎步行，因為這山路最險惡難行的，從山上看到瀑布，深流的澗水，灣灣曲曲，也使人心神驚盪的。安妮呢，她不停地呌好，這曾是巨賊盤居的大山上，可愛的景色够迷人了。又使我回憶起在杭州遊天竺山的情景來，這地方也可以和九溪十八澗的壯麗比美呢。可惜安妮沒有到過杭州，感不到那點咪兒吧了，安妮從現在起，也要過那樣的流浪生活了，也許，總有一天，她會有更多的甜和苦的經騐吧。</p>
<p>轎到汶村的時候，已快過黃昏，還有九華里的平陽的路程，老鶴那兩個轎夫跑得特別慢，那時陡然的來了風雨，到海宴街的時候，天已完全黑了，那淡黃的電燈在閃爍着，我們從早時上到這候，一百五十華里的難行的遠程，已把我們的肚子餓癟了。</p>
<p>可是，海宴街——夢里還在懷戀着的，海的王國，我父悄悄地投進她的懷抱里去了。</p>

<h3 id="c229">海上歸帆 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 夏理斯</p>
<p>「夕陽照着紅色的歸帆，飄盪在迢迢的海面；哦，帶着我庇愛人，安穩無恙地歸來吧！…………」</p>
<p>每一次海岸邊騰起這樣的歌聲的時候，那蓬着秀麗的頭髮的露薏莎，跣着兩隻褐色的脚，迎風挺直了胸脯站在花崗石上，用一種熱烈地期待的情感，等候着一個人——</p>
<p>這個人是戈米。</p>
<p>戈米現在正張開了兩隻異常堅實的臂膊，站在船頭上，背着將要沉落到海底去的夕陽。在夕陽底反照之下，他有着　色的肌膚，和突起的筋骨。「强健的戈米哪，」島上的人誰不這樣地讚美呢？而露薏莎，當她被戈米底有力的膊胳掛着，在島上每一個人家底門前走過時，她都感到異常的驕傲！戈米自然是愛着這粗野，然而十分美麗，刺激的露薏莎的：他一想到馬上就要會到這個野妮子了，心里便開了花那樣地愉快起來</p>
<p>可是，船愈駛近海岸，那女人們底合唱就愈加淸脆地傳入戈米底耳鼓；他聽着，臉色漸漸地沉下去了。</p>
<p>「…………</p>
<p>明朝我們將結婚了，而他再也不去漂海。</p>
<p>隨着風直吹入戈米底心坎，這强健的人是有着一股悒鬱的氣色飛上了眉尖</p>
<p>——明朝我們結婚？是的，露薏莎，我是這樣地允許過你，說我這一次歸來，一定不再去漂海的了。可是，露薏莎，這還是我們年靑人底夢想呢！我在海上並沒有撈得珍珠和珊瑚，祗帶了一船魚。這些魚又是船主的呢，我除了薪水，還能拿到什麽？而我又用什麽來娶你，露薏莎？</p>
<p>在這邊，與奮得要發在了的露薏莎已經離開了花崗石舖成的碼頭，跣足跑到沙灘上來了。她和着那悠揚的歌聲，睜大了美麗的眼睛，還伸出了右手間那一列浦帆招着，招着……</p>
<p>——明朝我們其的結婚了，戈米！你出去漂海的時候，不是緊握着我底手，對我說過這一次回來，我們將有一個舒適的家的嗎？是的，我是渴望着我有一個家的啊！戈米，我眞急死啦！</p>
<p>船更近了，太陽只殘留着一綫黃金色的餘暉，把腦袋沉向海里去。人們各自呼喚着自已底親人底名字，那滿頭白　的老祖母底聲音更加尖刺，呌着：</p>
<p>「彼得我底好孫兒呀，你是——終於－平安地回來了！」</p>
<p>於是她看見彼得從戈米底身邊衝了下來，投向她懷抱。戈米也暫時忘記了悒鬱，發現露薏莎正站在一邊等着他。像一對有廿五年不曾謀面的情人似地，他們緊緊摟抱着。他們都因為過度的興奮而說不出一句話來！過了好久，露薏莎才把頭從戈米底長着毛的胸前抬起來，帶着笑地向他說：</p>
<p>「戈米，我們結婚吧」。</p>
<p>「唔－是的，露薏莎－我們－哦，我眞高興呢」！</p>
<p>晚上，戈米在酒店里喝喝酒到半夜。</p>
<p>第二天，戈米又在船主那里簽了字，下次出帆的名單上，還有戈米底名字。</p>
<p>露薏莎哭倒在他懷中了。</p>
<p>一這是生活所迫的呵，露薏莎，並不是願意離開你…讓我再去一次吧，過不了多少天我就會回來的。露薏莎，我一不騙－你……咳，為什　老是哭？我不要你－哭」！</p>
<p>「為什麽不哭？戈米，你又要走啦」！</p>
<p>是的，在一個明朗的十月底早晨，戈米和一隊帆船又開出了這海島，去開拓他們底命運去了。露薏莎呢，等待着，熱烈地等待着歌聲又浮起在這寂寞的海岸——</p>
<p>『夕陽照着紅色的歸帆，飄盪在迢迢的海面！哦，帶着我底愛人，安穩無恙地歸來吧！…………』</p>
<h3 id="c230">老敎務員 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 牧野</p>
<p>不曉得為了什麼，點名的時候，眼睛從老光的近視鏡里望了出去，總是有些含糊不淸，彷彿在當中隔開了一層霧。那些年輕人，在敎室里搖晃着糢糊的影子，他分別不出那個是男女，他也辨不出誰的面貌。每個人的面孔映在他眼簾里的只是黃橙橙地一片，除此之外，便什麽也不再存在了。</p>
<p>他深為這事苦惱着，他自己咀咒着自己——為什麽生了眼睛反而給瞎子似的那麼無用呢？那麽為了更「盡職」一點，他便抱着一大本點名簿，走到每一個敎桌前，然後再呌出了一個一個的名字，再拿鉛筆吃力的劃上個「×」。那麽，他要挨門挨戶的走遍了每一個桌子。有的時候坐位上沒有人，他也走過去了，及至他發現那里沒有人時，他便被埋在一陣洪大的哄笑中了。</p>
<p>在這××專科學校里論年紀要以他為最大了，據說他在幾十年前是有過很好的「功名」的，那時自然是他的黃金時代了，可是，自從經過了他所最痛恨的「改朝換帝」之後，他便背時了，以至於弄到現在全校的職敎員中薪金最少的這麼個每月二十元的敎務員的位置……。要是一提起往事來，除了長吁短嘆之外，就把這「當今之世」來謾駡得體無完膚了。</p>
<p>他之所以能在這專校里做敎務員是靠了校長劉先生關係，他給校長是同鄉，又是同姓，每月二十元也巳經是優禮有加了，這里也就有人造謠（？）說他是校長的宗叔，這個也倒沒有人去深究。</p>
<p>他是只管點名的，十幾個敎室都要他去點名，如果學生的數目少了，也要他負責去找，什學院子里呵，寢室里呵，他都得要找遍了才可以，這是多麽麻煩的事呵！他想到自己敎私塾的時候那是什麽樣呵，學生都規規矩矩，不像這些年靑人那麽浮躁，除了男女談愛之外不再懂的什麽了！可是這些學生要他們有什麽用呵？於是他又想到校長身上了，他曉得校長是在多一個學生就多收幾十元的學費，這原則上是抱定了：愈多愈善，來者不拒的宗旨的，那麼這可苦了他了，他幾次的向校長建議給學生們的法三章（第一章就是「準時入敎室」）校長只是左耳里聽了，右耳里跑掉，他曉得如果這麼嚴格，對於收入項下是有損無益的。</p>
<p>「拿點名簿子來！」說不定在會麽時侯校長興緻來了，他要關心「校務」了，那麼，老敎務員　戰戰兢兢的把那一疊點名簿子捧過來。</p>
<p>「太不盡職了，太不盡職了」為什麽這麽多×呢？呵？…這怎麽能行，老是不到還行嗎，吿訴你，要你撲個的去呌，你總是…總是不聽，…我看你是吃飽了！…你看滿本子上是×××，我問你，你說好看不好看？」接着就砰！」的一下子校長先生把薄子使勁兒一丟，賭氣的走了！</p>
<p>他這里便把簿子一本一本的拾起來「…學生到了敎室里去幹什麽？先生也不到，還不是馬馬虎虎的算了嗎？…反正洋錢票弄到手了…」他這一席話便在肚子里咕嚕着，－並沒有講得出來！</p>
<p>上班鈴一嚮，他的工作便開始了，因為　並沒有「屹飽一，他滿頭大汗的跑遍了每一個敎室，捧着一大疊點名簿，劃着「／」字。在操塲上，寢室里，……甚至於厠所里他都跑遍了，他向着每一個只高興玩兒而不願進敎室去的學生們像是哀求他們似的：</p>
<p>「先生，你請到敎室里去好嗎？我兄弟是負點名之責的：不然，校長把脾氣都出在兄弟身上了，兄弟今年，今年六十幾歲了，家里還有兩口人！咳，老而無能了，要是校長一生氣，…我兄弟便只好滾蛋了，…請你先生帮帮忙，到敎室里去不是一樣的玩兒嗎？給女同學（男同學）談談，再不，帶本小說去翻翻，是不是？…只要你先生在敎室里坐着，其實睡一覺也沒有關係！…那樣，你先生可總是「到」了；那，我兄弟也可以在點名簿上多劃一個「／」，這是一舉兩得，你先生也好看，我的面子上也下得去，這麼…這麽大年紀的老頭子了，實在太作難了，你先生也不會忍……」</p>
<p>說的總是說就是了，聽不聽，他又那里管得着呢？</p>
<p>後來，終於使他發現了一個好法子了，就是你到也好，不到也好，在點名簿上是淸一色的「／」「／」「／」！校長先生見了自然是高興了。</p>
<h3 id="c231">平原中 <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 啟瑩</p>
<p>每逢初一十五，這平原中的莊主，召集了所有的騎馬的能手，舉行一個極大的競馬會，依着他的充裕的金錢，依着他的精越的騎術，藉此來博取羣衆的歡心與信仰。可是莊主每次的苦心都等於零了；眼望着那錦標是被一個並不出色的老人奪去了，羣衆都發在一般地擁護他，還有穿紅帶綠的娘兒們都嬌滴滴地呼着老爹前與老爹後。於是莊主被在塲的所有的人們，扔棄在無光的寂寞的一角了。在失意與狼狽之餘，每次使他都是用手托着下巴，咬着牙齒，閃着一對鼠似的眼光思索着，好像對老人有所陰謀的報復似的。</p>
<p>可是，老人却不相信，這世界還有什麼險惡，卑鄙的意識存在，他更不相信有名有利的莊主，會對他加以陷害，當每次人們向他警吿的時侯，他都是那樣毫不在意，搖搖腦袋說道：「不別提防，我一生就沒有看見您們那樣所說的事！」</p>
<p>於是，人們再也不向他加以警吿了。一天，兩天，……莊主要對老人加以陷害的事，也在人們的記憶裏漸漸地淡去了。老人也平平安安地生活着，每個時候人們都看得見老人和他的馬。突然，一天老人和他的馬失踪了，整日地沒有一個人看見老人和他的馬，這消息立刻傳遍了整個的村莊，大家都驚慌地跑出了屋子，只有莊主却安安穩穩地躱在屋中，人們都相信老人和他的馬是被害了。於是，入們都分途驅馬到平原中尋找老人了。</p>
<p>在夜深了很久，人們才尋着了老人，平原中月色慘淡得欲泣，老人坐在地下，低垂着腦袋，兩隻手抱着膝蓋。他的心愛的馬躺在他的身邊，已經是死了，鮮血流滿了地下，一望便知道他是被人殺死的，大家都噎息得說不出一句話來。</p>
<p>最後，老人站起身來，綏慢地走到馬的身邊去，顫抖着手將馬鞭子從馬的身上解了來，背到肩上去，彎着腰一句話也不說地走去了，老　大概覺悟到這世界是大大地變了吧？　（完）</p>

<p>女伶梅蘿香躭在這怪幽美的鼓浪嶼的旅館裏巳經很久了。正打算回到上海去的時候，那個上海明新舞台的大股東便老遠跑來接她。四十多歲的白森卿這樣愛護一個年輕的梅蘿香當然是有着他的目的的。</p>
<p>白森卿滿想這决的計劃已有百分之白的成功，他把他已在上海法租界辣斐德路租好房子的詁吿訴給蘿香的時候，想不到梅蘿香天眞地吿訴他：她在這富於詩意的鼓浪嶼已跟一個富於熱情的忠實的靑年馬子英熱戀上了。</p>
<p>白森卿是個很懂世故的商人，他明白以自己的年紀决敵不過英俊的馬子英；但是當地知道馬子英在報館裏當編輯。祇有賺到五十元錢一月薪水，怎能養活一個過着奢華生活的梅蘿香的時候，他對梅蘿香說了。多諷刺的話。</p>
<p>「我們都很年輕，我們可以努力奮鬥。」梅蘿香很勇敢的回答他。</p>
<p>馬子英來了，他瞧見白森卿在梅蘿香的房間裏，他當然便很明白他和她的過去的關係，而且他更知道梅蘿香在五年前嫁過一個現在巳經自殺了的丈夫；但是，這在他是决不在意的，像他自己也曾度過花天酒地的糜爛生活。交給過許多不三不四的女人一樣。只要現在彼此改過，那些巳往的事蹟他倆决不計有的。</p>
<p>不過，他現在可要求蘿香不要呌白森卿那樣的人陪着到上海去，不，這也許是命令的話。</p>
<p>梅蘿香當然是絕對的聽從；他倆預的好：待馬子英能够賺得更多的薪水的時候，决計到上海再接梅蘿香回鼓浪嶼。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Suma's Visit to Gao Zongwu Yesterday: Preliminary Consultations Before Meeting with Zhang and Chuan; Three Hours of Discussions, Contents Extremely Important <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Although there have been rumors for days about the timing of the seventh meeting between Zhang Qun and Kawagoe, none have been confirmed. Foreign reports stated that the meeting would take place on the afternoon of the 4th, based on the assumption that the three-day Japanese Meiji Festival would be over. However, it is now learned that the date has not yet been finalized. Suma, who returned to Nanjing from Japan, met with our diplomatic personnel today. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Suma, the Consul-General in Nanjing, visited Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, at 2:00 PM on the 3rd, for a three-and-a-half-hour meeting. This was a preliminary consultation in preparation for the seventh meeting between Zhang and Kawagoe. As this was Consul-General Suma's first consultation after returning to his post, it seems there was a fairly crucial discussion. However, the issues are important and extremely delicate, and the opinions of both sides are still not aligned. Therefore, there may be two or three more rounds of negotiations with Gao Zongwu. Once the method of resolution has made some headway, Zhang and Kawagoe will hold talks. Therefore, the seventh official meeting may be held this weekend. (3rd Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Army in North China Begins Attacking and Defending Exercise; Kawabe Commands the Northern Army to Defend the Outskirts of Beiping; Tashiro Leads the Southern Army in an Offensive; Japanese Troops March Through Beiping City During the Exercise <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army in North China began a large-scale exercise attacking Beiping at 7:00 AM on the 3rd. Brigade Commander Kawabe commanded the Mutaguchi and Kayashima infantry regiments (1st and 2nd) as the Northern Army, holding the outskirts of Beiping and digging trenches. Tashiro commanded the Suzuki artillery independent regiment, the Morita detachment, and the Shinabe, Kagawa, and Nakajima battalions as the Southern Army, taking an offensive stance. At dawn on the 3rd, the Morita detachment first circled around to the southwest of Beiping to attack the Northern Army's flank, but was defeated by the Kawabe Brigade and driven to the vicinity of Tongzhou, where it encountered the main force of the Southern Army in battle. Two squadrons of the air force led by Higuchi flew to bomb the Northern Army. At the same time, two detachments split off to launch a side attack from the northeast of Beiping. The entire army was mobilized, without sleep or rest. By the morning of the 4th, the Northern Army's Pinghan Railway line of communication was cut off, its front line wavered, and it was defeated by the Southern Army, retreating along the Pinghan Railway. The exercise ended at 9:00 AM, and at 11:00 AM, troops gathered at Babaoshan for a military review. Tashiro planned to return to Tianjin that night. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Five hundred members of the Japanese garrison stationed in Fengtai and 220 artillerymen from Tianjin, led by Captain Ittiki and Colonel Tanimura, respectively, marched on foot to the Babaoshan area west of Beiping at dawn this morning. Inspection groups from various agencies and liaison officers accompanied them. Another unit of 82 Japanese cavalrymen departed at 8:00 AM this morning. The Japanese troops will not return to Fengtai tomorrow. After the exercise ends, they will return to Fengtai in eight groups starting at 6:00 AM on the 5th, and then return to their respective bases. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army held a full-scale exercise today. More than a thousand Japanese troops concentrated in Tongxian advanced towards Beiping City, while more than a thousand Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai and Beiping City were jointly concentrated at the border between the eastern suburbs of Beiping City and Daxing County to engage in attack and defense warfare against the Japanese troops from Tongxian. At around 9:00 AM, the Japanese troops from Beiping and Fengtai feigned a retreat, and the Japanese troops from Tianjin and Tongxian pursued them, entering Chaoyangmen together and leaving the city through Xizhimen and Guang'anmen to conduct night combat exercises in the western suburbs of Babaoshan, Dajingcun, Lanmenkou, Mulou, and other places. The large-scale exercise ended at 4:00 AM tomorrow morning. At 10:00 AM tomorrow morning, troops will gather at Babaoshan to be inspected by Tashiro. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At around 8:00 AM this morning, the Japanese troops in Beiping and Fengtai began a feigned retreat. Infantry, cavalry, and artillery successively entered Chaoyangmen. According to statistics, a total of more than 20 tanks, hundreds of trucks, and more than a thousand officers and soldiers entered the city, along with 14 Chinese carts carrying Japanese army provisions, etc. After the tanks entered the city this morning, they passed through Dongxi Chang'an Street and returned along the original route. When they reached Xidan Archway, some went south through Xuanwumen and out of Guang'anmen, while others went north. All the tanks were covered with yellow cloth, and passersby were prevented from taking pictures. It was originally planned that more than 500 infantrymen of the Japanese army, who had feigned a victory, would enter the city through Chaoyangmen, but the route was temporarily changed to Guangqumen. It is said that two Japanese tanks were damaged in Ciyun Temple. Today, the entire police force of Beiping City was mobilized to increase posts and maintain order. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) More than 4,000 Japanese troops in North China conducted a large-scale offensive and defensive battle in the southwest suburbs today, then divided into two routes, one to the racecourse in the western suburbs and the other to Yuegezhuang. They conducted night combat exercises that evening and camped overnight in the western suburbs at the White Cloud Temple and Tianqing Temple. Commander Tashiro of the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin and Brigade Commander Kawabe of the garrison army personally went to the western suburbs to command and camped overnight at Jiangjiafen.

<p>(Hankou) The Japanese warships "Hira" and "Kotaka," anchored in Hankou, were ordered to go to Changsha. The two warships immediately began preparations to set out. (3rd Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e4">New Monetary Policy Declared Successful; Observations from a Financial Expert <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the government promulgated emergency decrees on November 3rd of last year to implement the new monetary policy, in order to preserve the nation's economic lifeline, consolidate the currency system, and improve finance, successive successes have been achieved. This month marks the first anniversary of the policy on the 3rd. A reporter interviewed a financial expert to inquire about his observations. According to him, the circulation of legal tender over the past year has not only been accepted by the people of the entire country without hesitation, but also its issuance volume and scope of promotion have expanded day by day. This is not only due to the wholehearted national love of the Chinese people, but also to the fact that the legal tender reserve is sufficient and the foundation is solid. This is the first point. Although the new monetary policy has been indirectly affected by the French franc crisis in the past year, the foreign exchange rate has always hovered around one shilling and two and a half pence. This kind of exchange rate stability has removed serious obstacles to legitimate foreign trade. Therefore, international trade has improved in the past year, and the unfavorable balance has been greatly reduced. This is the second point. Since the implementation of the new monetary policy, prices have risen reasonably, which shows that the phenomenon of currency deflation has been curbed. This is the third point. There are too many other facts that can prove the success of the new monetary policy to enumerate. Therefore, domestic and foreign opinions have unanimously praised it. It is hoped that the entire country, from top to bottom, will cherish the hard-earned gains of the past year even more. However, the reorganization of the reserve bank, the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, the unification of legal tender issuance, the adjustment of financial institutions, and the regulation of industrial finance all remain to be addressed by the financial authorities to promote industrial and commercial prosperity and revive the rural economy.

<h3 id="e8">Fu Zuoyi Returns to Suiyuan and Speaks: He Will Strictly Obey Orders from Above; Any Encroachment on Suiyuan Province Will Be Severely Punished; War in Eastern Suiyuan Could Break Out at Any Time <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Guihua) Fu Zuoyi returned to Suiyuan on the 3rd and made a statement, roughly stating that although Suiyuan Province is currently peaceful, both the eastern and western borders are tense. He swore to uphold (1) absolute obedience to orders from above and (2) the two principles of protecting the people and defending the territory. Anyone who disturbs the security of the people of Suiyuan, whether they are pro-Mongolian bandits or communists, will be severely punished. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Jining telegram: It is reported that Zuoyi arrived in Datong from Taiyuan at 2:00 PM on the 2nd and rushed back to Suiyuan that night. He passed through Jining at midnight and, together with Zhao Chengshou, inspected the border and made defense arrangements. The bandit army in northern Chahar plans to attack Xinghe with two brigades within ten days. There are about 400 troops from Wang Ying's and Li Shouxin's units near Nanhouchang. There is a unit of bandit puppet troops in Shangdu, as well as several airplanes and many tanks from a certain country. Our army is on high alert to prevent accidents. It is reported that Li Shouxin's unit will move west to Zhangbei, and the puppet sixth and seventh armies will take over the defense. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Zizhong said that the current situation in Eastern Suiyuan is indeed tense. Although he does not know the details in depth, he has learned from reports that it has reached a critical juncture. It seems difficult to secure a construction loan of four million yuan in Tianjin. The Ministry of Finance has approved one million yuan, which will be raised jointly by various banks to form a debt group. A contract can be signed in the near future. The construction of the Jintang Bridge requires about 700,000 yuan, and the rest will be used to repair roads. However, there are many things in municipal administration that need to be reformed, and a lot of money is needed. He will ask the Ministry of Finance to approve the Tianjin Customs surcharge as a special fund for this purpose. Song's trip to Tianjin is purely for his niece's wedding and nothing else. He will stay for a short time and then return to Beiping. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) Because Wang Ying's unit has few soldiers, many officers, and a shortage of supplies, they are all eager to seize Eastern Suiyuan, expand their troops, and get promoted. They have sent people everywhere to recruit soldiers, but few have volunteered. Because De Wang's Mongolian soldiers cannot endure the restrictions of military camps, another 40 to 50 people recently deserted with weapons. Li Shouxin has recently stationed heavy troops in the area of Shangyi Pingdinaobao, along with hundreds of cavalry, gathering in Shangdu, waiting for an opportunity to advance westward. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengshou returned to Suiyuan on the 3rd. Fu passed through Jining without stopping, while Zhao came to Jining that day to make arrangements. After meeting with Fu in Jining on the 3rd, they traveled together to Suiyuan to discuss matters. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the situation in Eastern Suiyuan has become extremely tense in recent days, and there are rumors of contact. Someone asked Ba Wenjun, director of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council's office in Nanjing. According to him, the head administrators Jingda, Miling, and Sulong recently sent a telegram that did not mention a tense situation. In addition, the Mongolian Banner Security Team is working hard to maintain defense. If there are any military emergencies, a telegram will be sent at any time. On the 3rd, someone from Suiyuan said that the situation in Suiyuan and Eastern Suiyuan is still peaceful, and our army's defenses are very solid. According to personal observations, even if a small contact occurs, it will only be a skirmish between sentries and will not lead to a formal war. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) As a result of the gradual westward advance of "Manchukuo" troops and Mongolian soldiers through Chahar territory, Suiyuan is once again feeling the threat of invasion. According to Chinese sources, the main force of Li Shouxin's "Manchukuo army" has already arrived in Shangdu, and the Mongolian soldiers under Wang Ying have also arrived at a location closer to the Suiyuan border. It is said that a large number of munitions and bullets are being transferred from Zhangbei to Shangdu via the newly built Zhangbei-Shangdu and Nanhouchang motorways. The Suiyuan provincial army is now awaiting the enemy's attack, as an outbreak is possible at any time. This new threat to Suiyuan has been brewing for several months, during which time there have been frequent reports of Chahar preparing for war. Li Shouxin's "Man" army is the one that fought with the Chinese army on the Rehe-Chahar border last year and occupied five counties in Chahar province. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A Wang paid separate visits to Ju Zheng and Ye Chucang on the morning of the 3rd to report on the situation in Mongolia. Cheng Qian and Feng Yuxiang then visited A Wang at the Central Hotel and had a very pleasant conversation. In the evening, Cheng Qian hosted a banquet for A Wang at the General Staff Headquarters, inviting various dignitaries to accompany him. Ju Zheng has scheduled a banquet for the evening of the 4th.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the incident in which a Japanese person, Tanaka, etc., seized and harassed a house on Ansi Street in Taiyuan, according to the latest confirmed news, when the Japanese person first forcibly seized the house, he immediately hung a Japanese wooden sign on the door of the house, roughly stating that the house should be temporarily managed by the Japanese army. Then, he changed the wooden sign to two pieces, one in Japanese, which had the same meaning as the original text, and one in Chinese, which stated that the house should be managed by the Japanese army as a matter of course. On October 30, the Japanese wooden sign was changed again, roughly stating that the house would be managed by the Japanese military attache and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff stationed in Taiyuan until a proper resolution was reached. To this day, this wooden sign is still hanging. Taiyuan is not a treaty port, and Shanxi Province has never recognized that Japan can station officials in Taiyuan. Tanaka's false statements and deceptive behavior are sufficient to prove that he knows he is unreasonable and is simply relying on sophistry. (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Li Tonghua visited the authorities of the Beining and Jinpu railways on the 3rd to discuss assisting the office in anti-smuggling matters. A concrete decision will be made after An Sier arrives. The Tianjin Customs seized two cases of smuggled goods at Xiyingmen Da Hongqiao on the 3rd. Both were sugar and rayon transported by car for export, and were detained in the customs. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) From August 28 to September 23, the Jicha General Inspection Office inspected and released a total of 72,000 bags of smuggled sugar, 5,250 boxes of rayon, 5,000 volumes of petroleum, and 4,500 pieces of wool fabric, collecting a total of 1.774 million yuan in inspection fees. However, the amount reported by the Jicha Association was less than one-tenth of this figure, so Song decided to abolish it immediately. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e15">Regulating Grain Prices <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, Industry, and Military Affairs are coordinating measures regarding food regulation and sales because grain prices have been rising in recent months, affecting the people's food supply. Regarding the ban on grain exports, the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Inspector General of Customs to first investigate the current market price and the purchase and sale of grain in the Shanghai market for reporting purposes, in order to determine the policy direction. According to relevant sources, statistics on national rice production over the past two years amount to 900 million piculs. Based on national consumption of 900 million piculs, plus a comparison of 5%, about 50,000 piculs of foreign rice need to be purchased each year. This year, there have been good harvests in various places. According to surveys and statistics, national rice production has reached more than 950 million piculs, which is sufficient for national consumption. However, because various provinces are handling the warehousing and stockpiling of rice, sources are scarce and grain prices are high. For now, if sales can be handled properly, grain prices will naturally be suppressed. Even if exports are not prohibited, they will not flow out. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Security in Tianjin was still tight on the 3rd, but it was slightly relaxed compared to the night of the 2nd. Armed security teams, cavalry patrols, and armored vehicles were constantly patrolling Dong Malu and Hebei Dajie. Qin Xinzhai and Han Ziqing, the ring leaders of the rioters, were apprehended by detectives from the Public Security Bureau at No. 27 Xin Yi Li in the French Concession and Yu Qing Chi in the South City on the morning of the 3rd and detained for questioning. Their accomplices are still lurking in a certain concession, plotting. Cheng Xixian, the director of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau, said that public security in Tianjin was tense on the night of the 2nd because a group of lawless elements wanted to create a serious diplomatic situation. Qin Xinzhai was the one who plotted and instigated this incident, but he was unable to succeed due to the tight security. Although the area is still under alert, it is believed that there will be no surprises. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) With the assistance of the French Concession police, Chinese police have apprehended a Chinese person named Zheng, who is said to be a leader sent to Tianjin by "Manchukuo" to engage in disturbances while the Japanese army is leaving Tianjin for exercises. A total of 20 people came to Tianjin this time. According to Chinese sources, these rioters planned to set fire to houses in the streets bordering the Chinese and Japanese concessions while riding in cars. Zheng is currently detained in the French Concession police station. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Because of rumors that troublemakers were plotting unrest, the Chinese authorities here have implemented special security measures at night to prevent this. Dong Malu and other streets bordering the Japanese Concession, because it is rumored that the rioters are using this area as a hiding place, have been specially assigned several armored vehicles to patrol back and forth. Security teams are stationed at important locations in the Chinese Concession. The same security measures have been taken in remote areas of Tianjin. However, as of now, no accidents have occurred. It is rumored that many former officials are related to organizations that are attempting to disrupt local order, and that this disturbance is a smokescreen to overthrow the current Tianjin government.

<p>(Nanjing) China's accounting year, which adopted the American July system, began in the second year of the Republic and has been followed to this day. However, this system is not suitable for China's financial situation, economic needs, and social customs. Therefore, legislators Wei Tingsheng, Chen Changheng, Ma Yinchu, and others advocated adopting the January system, that is, the calendar year system. They obtained the consent of Xu Kan of the Finance Resolution and Chen Qicai, the Director-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and submitted a proposal to the Central Political Committee to change the system, which was referred to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan has now resolved to change to the calendar year system, effective from January 1, 1938. This change was made after soliciting opinions from government agencies and industrial and commercial circles, and it is expected to be implemented smoothly in the future. However, the national and local budgets for the 25th year all end on June 30, 1937. Before the implementation of the calendar year budget in the 27th year, it is still under study whether to compile a half-year provisional budget for the six months from July to December of the 26th year or to follow the budget for the same period of the previous year. It is also learned that the Financial Committee of the Legislative Yuan is revising and drafting various laws on budget and final accounts, and the accounting year defined therein also adopts the calendar year system.

<p>— Sun Huairen</p>
<p>From the perspective of China's revenue, the imbalance of finances seems to have become an incurable cancer. To remove this cancer, there are only two means: one is to find a way to increase the gradually decreasing tax revenue; the other is to see if there is a way to cut expenditures. If both of these means fail, then the future of China's financial economy will be very pessimistic.</p>
<p>Here, we will first discuss the possibility of improving revenue.</p>
<p>In our previous narratives, which discussed finance in terms of finance, the situation of tax revenue is indeed getting worse. To change this situation in the future, we should naturally start by improving the root of taxation – the national economy. Generally, people who are optimistic about the legal tender policy believe that the legal tender policy can take on the responsibility of improving the root of taxation. They believe that after the implementation of the legal tender policy, the value of China's currency has decreased by about 25%. As a result of this currency depreciation, prices can be raised. As a result, most of China's farmers can sell their agricultural products for money, thereby increasing their purchasing power. On the other hand, as a result of the decrease in the value of China's currency, the import of foreign goods can be reduced, and national industries can take the opportunity to prosper, and the prosperity of the industrial and commercial classes is just around the corner. Also, China's export goods can also become prosperous due to the decrease in currency value. These various effects after the decrease in currency value can make the entire Chinese national economy prosperous, thereby making tax revenue gradually increase, and the imbalance in financial revenue and expenditure can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Whether these theories are all true, we will leave aside for the moment, but here a contradiction clearly arises, that is, even if the import of foreign goods can be reduced due to currency depreciation, the revenue from customs duties will naturally decrease as a result. May I ask if there is still a way for Chinese finance, which is built on the foundation of customs duties? Many national debts will not be able to be repaid, and how will revenue and expenditure be balanced? As for saying that the import of foreign goods will decrease and national industries can prosper, this is also impossible in reality, because the flow of international funds is running towards countries with falling currency values. Even if the import of goods from various countries decreases, the inflow of foreign capital will probably increase. Then, using their right to set up factories locally in China, they will launch fierce attacks. At that time, national industries will not only not prosper, but may even have no peers. Recently, many people have been using the upward trend of the production index compiled by the Central Bank (the average in 1935 was 102.1, and in June of this year it was 105.7) to prove the prosperity of industry. This argument is absolutely wrong. It should be known that the Central Bank's production index is compiled based on the materials from the Consolidated Tax Administration. Therefore, most of it is the production of foreign-owned factories, not the so-called national industries. Specifically analyzing various production indexes, we can even know that the product whose index has risen the most is beer (the average in 1935 was 101.1, and in June of this year it was 213.9), which has risen by 112.8%. The index that has not only not risen but has instead fallen is flour (the average in 1935 was 113.5, and in June of this year it was 82.4), which has fallen by 31.1%. This is because most of the beer is foreign-owned, while almost all of the flour is Chinese-owned. So how can this production index tell us that national industries are prosperous?</p>
<p>Moreover, in fact, most of China's imported goods are necessities, and currency depreciation may not necessarily be able to prevent their import. Regarding this point, some people have also pointed out recently that imports in the past six months of this year were only 460 million yuan, a decrease of 15.9% compared with the same period last year, and exports were 330 million yuan, an increase of 28.3% compared with the same period last year. Therefore, it is said that the legal tender policy has been effective. However, it is very dangerous to mechanically apply statistical figures in this way. How can we not consider the tens of millions of yuan of smuggling in North China in recent years as China's imports just because it is not included in the statistics? As for the increase in export goods, we should also analyze its contents. It is probably some military raw materials that are unique to China, or some commodities for which there has been a sudden increase in demand in overseas markets, and it has little to do with the depreciation of currency value.</p>
<p>Finally, we want to examine the extent to which the legal tender policy is beneficial to rural areas. Optimists of the legal tender policy believe that the first good result for rural areas is that it can raise agricultural product prices. This point cannot be denied. The following is a comparison of several agricultural product indexes before and after the currency reform:</p>
<p>September 1935 September 1936</p>
<p>Shanghai Agricultural Product Wholesale Price Index 72.27 88.57 (July)</p>
<p>Shanghai Exported Agricultural Product Price Index 74.50 112.20</p>
<p>Shanghai Imported Agricultural Product Price Index 121.10 137.20</p>
<p>From this index, it can be seen that agricultural product prices have indeed risen, but these are, after all, just prices in the city, which are much higher than the selling prices in rural areas. According to a survey by the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, for example, the difference between the rice price in the producing areas and the consuming areas in various counties in Zhejiang is often in the range of two yuan. The difference will of course be even greater in other inland areas where transportation is more inconvenient. Therefore, the 20% or more increase in agricultural product prices in cities probably has a negligible impact on agricultural product prices in rural areas. Moreover, what we should pay even more attention to is that the agricultural product price import index is still far above the export price index. In addition, the indexes of production goods and consumer goods in the import price index also generally tend to be the same as agricultural products. Therefore, the benefits that farmers get from the rise in agricultural product prices are mostly offset by the losses suffered from the rise in the prices of their consumer goods, and it is difficult to say how much improvement there has been.</p>
<p>From the results of these analyses, it can be seen that the legal tender policy's power to improve the national economy should definitely not be overestimated. Since it is difficult to have significant hope for a significant improvement in the national economy recently, then not only can there be no hope for an increase in tax revenue in finance, but also the tendency for tax revenue to gradually decrease is probably very difficult to prevent.

<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, has separately telegraphed orders to the counties of the first, second, and third phases to comply with the prohibition of opium. Now that the autumn harvest has ended and spring plowing is approaching, in order to promote the matter early, a proclamation has been printed and distributed to prevent the people of the entire county from planting opium again. At the same time, orders have been issued to the county magistrates to widely post the proclamation and personally enter rural areas to investigate and eliminate poisonous plants. Instructions on matters that require attention have been provided for effective implementation, so that no opium seeds will enter the soil this year, and no opium seedlings will appear next year, in order to maintain the prohibition policy. The original text of the instruction and proclamation is recorded below: "Regarding the prohibition of opium in this province, it is handled in five phases. The counties in the first and second phases that prohibit the planting of opium seedlings must be completely prohibited in the past two years. The counties in the third phase should implement the prohibition starting from January 1937. Orders have already been telegraphed for compliance. Now that the autumn harvest has ended and spring plowing is approaching, it is urgent to promote the matter early and personally enter rural areas to investigate and eliminate poisonous plants. It is appropriate to print and distribute a proclamation, ordering the county magistrate to widely post it and make it known to all, and to list the matters that require attention for implementation as follows: (1) Widely inform the district and township chiefs to order all households within their jurisdiction who have opium seeds in storage to hand them over within three days, or destroy them themselves, and submit a written guarantee to the county through the layers, and the county will supervise the burning of the handed-over opium seeds and report to the government for record, and send personnel to investigate, and if found again, in addition to confiscating the opium seeds, the holder will be sent to the court for handling. (2) Order the district and township chiefs to warn each household not to plant opium, and supervise to ensure that no seeds enter the soil, and issue a guarantee that no opium seedlings will be found in the future, and submit it to the county for record, and report it to this government for record. (3) Prepare and issue a "Those who plant opium will be severely punished according to military law" simple notice and post it in rural areas, and hold meetings with all sectors of society to expand publicity. (4) If the county territory borders counties that have been slow to prohibit opium, and there are enclaves interspersed in various places, the related counties should be consulted immediately to reorganize according to the province's measures for handling enclaves and exclaves, clarify county boundaries, and report the special case. Exclaves should be completely prohibited regardless of territory, and in enclaves, neighboring counties should be consulted to ensure that no opium is planted within one zhang of the connecting lines with the opium-prohibiting counties, and markers should be set up to avoid mixing. Now that the communists are fleeing west and large armies are gathering, if strict implementation is not carried out and jiahe is planted instead, not only will the poisonous atmosphere be difficult to clear, but also food supplies will inevitably be exhausted. The opium should be complied with and strictly implemented, so that no opium seeds will enter the soil this year, and not a single opium seedling will be found next year, which is of utmost importance.

<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: The Education Department of Zhejiang Province, in order to commend Zhejiang literature, promote academics, and achieve the effect of learning from the past to plan for the future, decided to hold the Zhejiang Literature Exhibition this year. The Provincial Library, which has been focusing on collecting books and documents from the province, was specifically assigned to organize the event. After several months of preparation, it has been completed and officially opened on the 1st of this month. Detailed methods were established for collecting items for the exhibition, and collection branches were set up in the nine administrative regions of Zhejiang Province, as well as in Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, and other places. With the support of various public institutions and esteemed scholars from various regions, many types of items were collected. According to the library's announcement, the content includes books, calligraphy, portraits, antiques, rubbings of inscriptions, and revolutionary literature. From the beginning of the collection to the present, over 6,000 varieties and 20,000 items of various cultural relics have been obtained. The most valuable and rare items are categorized and recorded as follows: (1) Manuscripts of Local Worthies, such as Zhang Dai of Shanyin's handwritten "Shi Kui Shu" (said to be plagiarized by Gu Yingtai) and "Tao An Miscellaneous Manuscripts," Chen Hongshou of Zhuji's handwritten first draft of "Bao Lun Tang Collection," Wu Yankuang of Yongjia's "Flower History," Wang Yizhong of Qingtian's "Jing Fei Lu," Zhu Yizun of Xiushui's first draft of "Jing Yi," Qi Zhaonan of Tiantai's handwritten "Yu Zhi Tang Wen Ji," Sun Yirang of Ruian's various original manuscripts, Huang Yizhou of Dinghai's "Jing Li Miscellaneous Works," and Zhang Binglin of Yuhang's handwritten books, etc. (2) Collated Editions, such as Qian Taiji of Jiaxing's hand-copied and collated "Laozi Daodejing," and Sun Yirang of Ruian's collated "Li Qi Tong Gu." (3) Manuscripts, such as Feng Dao Wang's handwritten "Lu Shi Shi Xue" from the Ming Dynasty, Xu Wei's handwritten "Wen Ji Shu Zhuan," handwritten poem drafts by Zhong Huang, Lu Wudang's handwritten drafts of his father's "Wancun Poems" from the Qing Dynasty, and Cha Chuba and Lu Baojing's handwritten poems, which are treasures of the book world. (4) Portraits of Local Worthies are particularly rare, including the portrait of Qian Wusu Wang of Wuyue, as well as the portrait of Yang Cihu of the Song Dynasty (painted in the late Ming Dynasty), Liu Wencheng's "Shi Shou Jing Tu" (painted by Chen Laolian), a combined portrait of seven generations of Wang Wencheng Gong, portraits of Fan Dongming (Qin), Mao Xihe, Jiang Ximing, and Zheng Hancun of the Qing Dynasty, a combined portrait of Xihu and Zhu Zhutuo (painted by Ding Xiaozhi with inscriptions), portraits of Quan Xieshan, and combined portraits of Xieshan and Xinghang Dazong, and portraits of martyrs such as Zhang Cangshui and Qian Zhongjie. There are also countless large photographs taken of other portraits. (5) Relics of Local Worthies, such as Qian Wusu Wang's iron certificate, which could not be obtained despite negotiations, but the Tian Ce Tang jade seal of Wusu is also very valuable. Other items include the painting inkstone of Meihua Daoren of the Yuan Dynasty, Wu Zhonggui of Jiaxing, the court tablet of Wang Huaibin of Yunhe in the Ming Dynasty, the iron helmet used by Zheng Xiao of Haiyan during the defense against Japanese pirates, Zhang Cangshui's inkstone (collected by the Yang family of Cixi and never shown), Leqing Heshanren Baiyi's inkstone, Chen Guifen, the martial arts champion of Tiantai in the Qing Dynasty's Yulin armor, Zhang Shuwei's postscript on the Qin measuring instrument of Jiaxing, and Tao Qibiao's Tao Gong bed and Tao Gong cabinet of Kuaiji, all of which are worthy of cherishing. The relics of revolutionary martyrs are displayed separately from Baiyi's inkstone, etc. (6) A section on National Revolutionary Documents (limited to Zhejiang natives), due to the difficulty of solicitation, the collection is limited. However, items such as the Guangfuhui history written in pencil by Tao Huanqing, the leader of the Guangfuhui, two days before his martyrdom, the secret propaganda materials of Ao Mengjiang of Jiaxing, ancestral teachings, and prayers, and Xu Bosun's early-year map of the Chinese coast are also rarely seen by the Chinese people. The exhibition also includes relics of Qiu Nüxia and portraits of martyrs from Shanyin. Chen Yingshi's blood-stained clothing, treasured by the Lake Society and not easily shown to the public, is also brought here for public viewing through the efforts of the organizers, echoing the bronze statue on the lake. (7) Calligraphy and paintings of local worthies, selected from more than 500 scrolls, are overwhelming in their beauty, whether in the form of scrolls, hand scrolls, or album pages. Notable examples include Wang Wencheng Gong's family letters from the Ming Dynasty, Liu Ji's hand-written notes, Zhen Hezhi's imitation of Mi Zhishui, Ren Dao of Ruian's landscape painting, Wu Cheng's Wusi Xiamu Chuiyin map, Chen Laolian's Xishan Dushu map of Zhuji, Mao Xihe's painting of Yulinglong Stone, Dai Wengong's bamboo painting of Qiantang, and other masterpieces too numerous to mention. Xia Gui and Xia Ze of Qiantang in the Song Dynasty are suspected of being forgeries, and the authentic works of Yue Zhongwu and the correspondence of Ge Xiaoxian of Linhai are not included in the count of the works of local worthies. (8) Printed Books and Documents include the "Bao Qie Tuo Luoni Jing," printed during the Xian De period of the Later Zhou Dynasty, discovered at Tianning Temple in Huzhou (20 years earlier than the Leifeng Pagoda scroll), Song Dynasty Jianben, Chen Jieyuan's bookstore edition, Yuan Dynasty West Lake Academy edition, and fine prints from Zhejiang Province in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, which can be used to view the history of printing in Zhejiang. (9) Collections of Books and Documents, including the collections of Fan's Tianyi Pavilion, Qi's Danshengtang in the Ming Dynasty, Zhu's Shancaitang, and Bao's Zhibuzu Zhai in the Qing Dynasty, as well as Ding's Bachuanjuanlou and Sun's Yumeilou, are all displayed. Rare items include Yan Jiuneng's postscript on Zhou Yigong's manuscript from the Song Dynasty and Wu Meicun's hand-copied "Linpu Zhou Xiansheng Ji" from Shancaitang, which are treasures of the book world. (10) Scientific Documents include a large collection of Ming and Qing Dynasty provincial examination records, and the Ming Dynasty Dengke records from Tianyi Pavilion in Ningbo are also selected and exhibited. The most eye-catching are the original Zhu Juan of Qi Chengrang and Qi Biaojia of Shanyin in the Ming Dynasty, and the silver cup used by Zhang Weichi of Haiyan in the early Qing Dynasty at the Yan Lu Ming banquet in Zhang's Sheyuan, as well as the Jinshi clothing and palace examination papers of Chen Shengqin of Tiantai in the Qing Dynasty collected from Taizhou. (11) There is a large collection of archives, such as the private accusation of Zhang Dajie by the Grand Scholar Hu Zhaolong during the Shunzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, the memorial of the bribery case of Shen Jinshi of Huzhou, the memorial of Ruan Yuan, the governor of Zhejiang in the 14th year of Jiaqing, and the copied drafts of the Yang Naiwu case preserved by Yuhang County, which are also of great value. (12) The collection of Zhejiang local chronicles is extremely rich, including the Song Dynasty editions of "Siming Zhi" and "Chicheng Zhi," as well as the Ming and Qing Dynasty chronicles. In addition to those collected by the Zhejiang Library over the past 30 years, the treasures of Tianyi Pavilion, Jiaye Building, Wufeng Old Hut, the National Library of Peiping, Jinling University, and other private collections are also combined to form a grand spectacle. (13) The charts include 40 newly drawn maps of Zhejiang's historical geography, as well as old maps of Zhejiang Province from the Ming and Qing Dynasties borrowed from the National Library of Peiping. The various economic and transportation maps sent by the construction agencies are not included. (14) The genealogy section includes the family histories of large surnames from various parts of the province in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, which the Zhejiang Library originally collected, supplemented by local borrowings. Among them, the Song Dynasty genealogy treasured by the Chen family of Fengqiao, Zhuji, is the most famous. The first page of the genealogy has the inscription of Emperor Gaozong in the 15th year of Shaoxing, four portraits of Chen Sheng, Chen Zizuo, etc., and the national seal of "Zhang of the Great Song." It is said that Song and Yuan Dynasty genealogy books are quite common, but this is the only one that is generously displayed at this exhibition, making it the most valuable genealogy and a rare sight in the world. (15) There are very few original bronzes and stone inscriptions on display this time. The gilded pagoda of Wuyue and the Tang Dynasty stone scripture pillar are quite precious. The rubbings are collected by the Zhejiang Library over the years and contributed by various parties, and they are very numerous. In addition to the recent rubbings, there are also old objects from the Tang and Song Dynasties. (16) The calligraphy and paintings are not numerous, but there is the Dongyang version of the Lanting Collection, and Wang Shijun's "Luoshen Fu" rubbed from the Chengxintang paper of the Southern Tang Dynasty, borrowed by Mr. Sun Zhifu, is a treasure of the inner court with obvious Zhu Zhang marks. Although it is not specifically related to Zhejiang literature, it is a treasure of this art. The collection of cultural relics is so large that the display was not completed at the time of writing, and the compilation and recording were hasty and flawed. I hope to describe it in detail another day. (Editor's note: The list of exhibits and inscriptions will be published in the special issue of the Zhejiang Library's "Literary Journal," Volumes 3 and 4.)</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Black Shirt Premier's Roar <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The roar of the Italian Black Shirt Premier in Milan on the 1st of this month simply shook the hearts of every European. The importance of this speech to the European political situation is not only because it contains many important points, but also because it indicates a new trend in the foreign policy of the Fascist group. The Black Shirt Premier's speech was delivered after the Italo-German talks, so the attitude of Germany can also be seen from Italy's attitude. In other words, Mussolini's speech was actually a revelation of the results of the German-Italian talks. Such a declaration with great significance will undoubtedly have a great impact on the future development of the European political situation.</p>
<p>The Black Shirt Premier's speech, in addition to a part on domestic affairs, covered a wide range of foreign affairs and was very important. Mussolini first attacked the illusions of pacifists, such as the Disarmament Conference, the League of Nations, and the collective peace system. He then explained Italy's attitude towards the Danube River basin countries of Britain and France, as well as communism. Regarding the results of the Italo-German talks, he believes that they are the basis for cooperation between European countries. Let us now analyze some of the key points to speculate on the diplomatic trends of the Fascist group and its relationship with the international political situation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Mussolini's attack on the pacifist "illusion." In the world of imperialism, seeking the success of disarmament and forming a truly peaceful League of Nations is an illusion that is not easy to achieve great success. However, we know that in the world of thick gunpowder, the collective security system is still a relatively practical way to maintain peace. Moreover, the destruction of this illusion must be largely blamed on aggressive countries such as Italy, Germany, and Japan. Now Mussolini is killing the patient with a knife in one hand, and telling people that the patient was going to die anyway, blaming the doctor who treated him for being meddlesome. This is really illogical.</p>
<p>Due to Mussolini's attack on the "illusion" of peace, he will naturally oppose France and the Soviet Union, because France and the Soviet Union are the strongest supporters of collective peace and the League of Nations. Mussolini said that the relationship between France and Italy after the Rome Agreement was very close, but since France insisted on the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy, it had to take retaliatory measures. And for the communism of the Soviet Union, Mussolini now wants to resume his initial opposition movement. This clearly shows the result of the Italo-German talks: Italy is taking a more pro-German, anti-French, and anti-Soviet policy.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the countries in the Danube River basin, Austria and Hungary have been under the influence of Rome since the establishment of the Three-Power Protocol. However, Mussolini's special support for Hungary's revision of the peace treaty, the recovery of lost territories, and the satisfaction in the near future is a clear expression, which is rare in the past and a direct attack on the countries of the Little Entente. No wonder it has caused great repercussions in Romania and Czechoslovakia. But the most strange thing is the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia. Mussolini indicated that there is a possibility of improvement. We all know that the conflict between Italy, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Yugoslavia has been very serious in the past ten years. But now Mussolini says that a friendly relationship can be established. This clearly shows that Mussolini wants to win over Yugoslavia and break up the unity of the Little Entente. Because Yugoslavia has always been strongly opposed to communism and has not yet recognized the Soviet Union, it is inevitable that it will arouse Italy's delusions. Italy's aggressive policy towards the Danube countries will inevitably increase the disputes in the Central European political situation.</p>
<p>Again, Italy's policy towards Britain may undergo major changes in the future. Since the East African War, the severity of the conflict between Britain and Italy is known to everyone. But in Mussolini's speech, although he firmly stated that if Britain does not respect Italy's interests and status in the Mediterranean, then Italy will not hesitate to go to war, in his heart, Mussolini revealed the intention of compromise with Britain. Therefore, The Times said, "Britain is very encouraged by Mussolini's eagerness to improve relations between Britain and Italy." And the Daily Mail said, "Britain should immediately respond to Mussolini's frankness and expressions of goodwill." Other newspapers also have similar criticisms. From this, it can be seen that Italy's policy towards Britain will undergo great changes in the future. The main reason for the change is the result of the Italo-German talks, because Germany wants to win over Britain in order to deal with the peace front, so that it will not lean towards France and the Soviet Union. The recent German-Italian approval of calling the Locarno Conference earlier is a side proof.</p>
<p>Mussolini's speech involved all the important issues in Europe, but he did not say a word about the most serious Spanish war. This is very noteworthy. Perhaps the talks between Germany and Italy have not yet reached a compromise on this matter. However, based on our analysis of Mussolini's speech, we can already determine that the relationship between Italy and Germany has become closer than before, and the unity of the Fascist front has also developed further than before. This threat to peace in Europe and the world is, of course, very serious.</p>
<h3 id="e49">British Parliament Reconvenes; King's Speech Emphasizes the Far East; Hopes for Successful Sino-Japanese Negotiations; Foreign Policy Based on the League of Nations. <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(London) The new session of Parliament held its official opening ceremony today. The King's speech expressed the hope to revisit India after the coronation and mentioned that the British government is concerned about the political situation in the Far East and hopes that the current Sino-Japanese negotiations will achieve satisfactory results. His Majesty originally planned to travel from Buckingham Palace to Westminster in the carriage used by the late King George V during his coronation, but it was canceled due to rain and changed to a car. The escort was the Duke of Beaufort, the Grand Chamberlain of the Inner Court. This morning, it rained heavily, and since there was no sign of improvement, the original plan was changed. However, the crowd watching along the road was still very crowded, and the road was full of umbrellas. The relentless rain and thin fog made the surroundings gray, but the people's enthusiasm for welcoming was not diminished. Cheers erupted as the car passed by. Inside the House of Lords, the ceremony was held as usual. Since His Majesty has not yet been crowned, he did not wear the imperial crown. Queen Mother Mary's cold has gradually healed, but she has not yet left her room, so she did not attend. Only the King's three younger brothers participated in the ceremony. The King first made a solemn Christian oath, and then read the speech, which mainly stated that the British government's policy is still based on the League of Nations member states, so it will strive to promote the conference of the five countries of the Locarno Pact. The Imperial Conference to be held in London in May next year will provide the representatives of the imperial governments with the opportunity to discuss and re-prove the value of enhancing close understanding. When the coronation ceremony is held, he hopes to visit India again, so that the princes and people of that place will know that he has inherited the imperial crown. Strengthening the defense plan is essential for the protection of the empire, and the government is very satisfied with this. The British government is also concerned about the political situation in the Far East, and peace and tranquility there are closely related to the interests of the British people in that part of the world, so it sincerely hopes that the current Sino-Japanese negotiations will achieve a satisfactory solution. British industry and commerce now have the hope of continuing to develop. The government is now considering a merchant shipping maintenance plan suitable for the needs of the country, and indicates the legal system for reorganizing the coal mining industry and dealing with individuals and the state who disturb public order, but without hindering their legitimate freedom of speech or assembly. The government also intends to propose bills for the development of domestic agriculture and fisheries within the Factory Law, and will use a great plan to improve the national physique, especially focusing on young people.

<h3 id="e50">Regarding Mussolini's Speech, Britain Expresses Willingness to Accept, but on the Premise of a New Locarno Pact; Hopes for Mutual Respect for Mediterranean Rights. <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>(London) Officials believe that Mussolini's speech in Milan yesterday, regarding the conclusion of a Mediterranean agreement, requires the establishment of a new Locarno Pact before this agreement can be concluded. The British public also believes that most of Mussolini's speech is practical common sense, so before proceeding with negotiations on the Mediterranean issue, negotiations on a new Locarno Pact must be started first. Moreover, if this Mediterranean agreement is to be negotiated, it may immediately cause problems for various countries in the eastern Mediterranean, and the Spanish incident is also difficult to avoid being involved. Britain has solemnly declared that the method of recognizing Italy's conquest of Abyssinia, as requested by Mussolini, is difficult to implement at present, but the British government has recognized Italy's power in Abyssinia as a fait accompli, because the British Embassy in Abyssinia has already established relations with the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, Graziani. Britain's only concern about the Mediterranean is the maintenance of the status quo. Britain has long expressed its willingness to recognize Italy's interests in the Mediterranean, but Italy must also respect Britain's interests there. In short, from the British point of view, the new Locarno Pact is the most useful step to resolve the European situation. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Vienna) A semi-official Federal Post reporter stationed in the Hungarian capital recently announced that the Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy and Prime Minister Daranyi are scheduled to visit Rome at the end of this month. When returning home, they will stop here to pay a visit to Austrian President Miklas. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political figures recently confirmed the saying that Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy will visit Italy soon. According to Prime Minister Mussolini's speech in Milan yesterday, when he mentioned Hungary, he said, "The enthusiasm of the Italian people for the Hungarian people will be publicly expressed in the near future." This refers to the visit of Admiral Horthy. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Hungarian Capital) Prime Minister Daranyi recently sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, briefly stating, "The people of our country sincerely thank you for the speech you delivered in Milan yesterday. I also respectfully express my friendship to you." The Hungarian newspapers commented on the Italian Prime Minister's speech, saying that the Italian Prime Minister is the first great power leader to so clearly support Hungary's legitimate demand to amend the treaty. Well-informed sources also said that the Italian Prime Minister had already decided on his attitude towards the Central European issue several years ago, and the speech he made today is only a natural result.

<p>(Lisbon) According to the Spanish rebel army, the attack on Madrid has made significant progress. It has occupied Villaviciosa, ten miles southwest of the capital, and has advanced along the Aranjuez-Madrid Avenue to within three miles of the tram terminus on the outskirts of the capital. At dawn this morning, the Nationalist army began shelling the Getafe air force base, nine miles south of the capital, and will then attack with infantry. It is expected that Getafe can fall within a few hours. The Nationalist army north of the capital is now crossing the Guadarrama Mountains and the Leon Pass, advancing towards Villalba. If the Nationalist army occupies the town, the position of the Escorial government army will be seriously threatened. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Navalcarnero) A special dispatch from our reporter stated that the Nationalist army advanced yesterday along the highway between this city and Madrid, and occupied the two towns of Villamantilla and Villanueva Canada. Until 5:00 p.m., it fought fiercely with the government army again, defeated it, and occupied the town of Brunete. From now on, the Nationalist army's positions between Navalcarnero and Chapineria have become one. In this battle, 300 members of the government army were killed, including many Russians. (Havas, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) The Sub-Committee established by the Adjustment Committee for the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Method met at 3:30 p.m. today and ended at 7:00 p.m. According to the suggestion put forward by Lord Plymouth, the chairman of the Adjustment Committee and the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (referring to monitoring the Spanish seaports and the border between Portugal and Spain), it discussed how to enhance the monitoring method of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. The representatives of the countries agreed to request instructions from their respective governments. The Sub-Committee then discussed the suggestion put forward by the Soviet representative to monitor the Portuguese seaports. The representatives of the major countries successively expressed their opposition, and said that the border between Portugal and Spain should implement the monitoring method, so there is no need to monitor the Portuguese seaports. The Soviet representative refuted this view, saying that if the Portuguese seaports can be monitored, then the situation of shipping weapons to Spain by plane will no longer occur. As a result, the Sub-Committee did not make a decision and adjourned. It will continue to be discussed at the next meeting or at the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee on the 4th of this month. The date of the next meeting of the Sub-Committee has not yet been decided. As for the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee, if the representatives of the countries have received instructions from their respective governments by then, the issue of monitoring the Portuguese seaports can be submitted for discussion, but it is feared that the instructions will be difficult to send by then.

<p>Fukushima: An earthquake occurred here at 5:45 AM this morning, startling citizens from their sleep and causing them to flee outdoors, leading to temporary chaos. The extent of the damage is still being investigated, but when the earthquake struck, roof tiles flew, shop windows shattered, and electricity and telephone lines were cut, completely disrupting long-distance communication. However, it appears that neither people nor livestock were harmed. According to the Fukushima Observatory, the earthquake occurred at 5:46:26.5 AM on the 3rd, with an initial tremor lasting 16 seconds, a seismic intensity of 1.2 millimeters, an epicenter located 120 kilometers northeast of Kin-Hua Mountain off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, a total duration of 10 minutes, and a moderate nature, not significantly different from previous earthquakes in the Sanriku region. (3rd, DOMEI News)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 5:46 AM this morning, a strong earthquake struck the Kanto region, with tremors felt over a wide area, including the Tohoku region, the entire Kanto region, and parts of the Chubu region. The tremors were most severe in Fukushima, Miyagi, and Iwate. The epicenter was in the deep sea northeast of Fukushima, resulting in relatively little damage. Had the epicenter been on land, it would have been a major earthquake, causing a terrible disaster. (3rd, DOMEI News)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Four Thousand Several Hundred Million Voters Decide the American Political Situation: Presidential Election Held Yesterday; Various Parties Predict Roosevelt's Advantage <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The people who are preparing to vote for the president tomorrow number a total of 45 million. The success or failure of the Democratic candidate, President Roosevelt, and the Republican candidate, Governor Landon, rests in the hands of these individuals. Election Day is a national holiday. Clubs, bars, and restaurants are all busy preparing, but until the polling places close, no beer or alcohol of any kind may be sold. Movie theaters nationwide are finding ways to project election results on the screen. It is feared that more than 100,000 citizens will gather in Times Square in New York, waiting for the various colored lights from the top of the tower to indicate the election situation. Radio stations will report the results at any time, without stopping all day long. The Associated Press has already leased 280,000 miles of telegraph lines, ready to send telegrams reporting election vote counts at any time, and will employ 50,000 personnel to count the votes. The police are preparing for possible riots in eastern New York and will station strong police forces there as a precaution. Many businesses on New York's Heng Street have announced that they will remain open all night during the election to report the news to their London branches. (2nd, Reuters News)</p>
<p>(New York) Before the election, various parties are still making efforts to study the results of "mock voting." Only the Literary Digest and Hua Weekly predict Landon will win. According to the results of the mock voting held by the New York Newsletter, Roosevelt won by a large margin, with 315 electoral votes, exceeding the 266 votes required for the election. The New York Times announced that Roosevelt has 236 votes that can be determined and 170 votes that are promising. It is not yet known whether the Pacific Coast Seamen's Strike will have an impact on the election. American media tycoon Hearst arrived here yesterday from Europe aboard the Queen Mary. According to his prediction, Landon should be able to win. The New York Evening Journal, which he runs, published an editorial urging readers to vote for Landon to save America. (2nd, Reuters News)</p>
<p>(New York) Today, the banking community is betting on President Roosevelt's victory in this election by a ratio of five to two. Last Saturday night, the ratio was eight to five. As for the situation in various states, Roosevelt also has the lead, with a ratio of two to one in New York, six to five in Ohio, three to two in Illinois, and four to one in California. Landon has the lead in New Jersey, with a ratio of seven to five. In Pennsylvania, Roosevelt and Landon are evenly matched, both with a ratio of three to two. (2nd, National News)</p>
<h3 id="e58">American Voters Vote in the Rain: The Tendency of the Middle Class is Unclear; Landon Takes the Lead in the First Few Places <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>(New York) This morning, the sky was gloomy and there was rain. The American people went to the polling places to elect the president. Twelve voters from the village of Millsfield, New Hampshire, went to vote one minute before midnight, hoping to gain the honor of being the first to vote. Of these twelve people, five voted for Landon, two voted for President Roosevelt, and the remaining five abstained temporarily. Many places in the United States are betting that President Roosevelt will not win, but the tendency of the middle class is still a mystery and may suddenly change dramatically. It is expected that President Roosevelt will win a majority of the votes from the labor community, the unemployed, and young people, but the middle class is frightened by propaganda, and it is not known to what extent. Whether the intense propaganda against the New Deal has an impact on the "white-collar" class can only be proven by voting today. All the votes cast in the village of Somerset, Vermont, were for Landon. According to the first report from Houston Town, Texas, President Roosevelt currently has 126 votes and Landon has 21 votes.

<p>The results of the election in the village of Millsfield, New Haven, show that Republican candidate Landon won. The entire village had a total of twelve voters. Voting began at midnight and ended immediately after seven votes were cast. Landon received five votes. This village is the first in the United States to report the election results.

<p>Massachusetts, New Ashford: As a result of the election in this town, Republican presidential candidate Landon received 26 votes, and President Roosevelt received 19 votes. This is the first fully disclosed result in the country. In the town of Tolland, Maine, Landon received 44 votes, and Roosevelt received 21 votes. (3rd, National News Agency)</p>

<p>(New York) President Roosevelt and Republican presidential candidate Landon will both broadcast "fireside chats" on the radio tonight, ending the most expensive campaign in history. Voting will begin tomorrow morning. According to today's gambling in various cities, everyone is betting on Roosevelt's election. The total cost of this campaign exceeded 13 million yuan, of which 7 million yuan was spent by the Republican Party, 4 million yuan by the Democratic Party, and the rest by smaller organizations such as the Liberty League, the National Social Justice League, and the United Mine Workers. Democratic National Committee Chairman Farley said that President Roosevelt can get the support of 46 states, with only Maine and Vermont electing Landon. Republican National Committee Chairman Hamilton believes that Landon has a good chance, saying that the 14 states east of the Mississippi River and north of the Ohio River will elect Landon, and that he is confident even in the far western states. As for the congressional elections, Republicans expect to gain 45 seats in the House of Representatives. Democrats privately admit that they will lose about 35 seats. However, although Republicans may slightly increase their seats in the Senate, even if Landon is elected, he will not be able to seize control. Statisticians estimate today that between 42 million and 45 million voters will vote. Observers believe that during the campaign, the model of a new party has been formed. All left-wing and radical elements will vote for the Democratic Party, while conservative Democrats will switch to the Republican Party, and there are quite a few fence-sitters, such as Senators Johnson and Borah, who have not said a word. (2nd, National News)</p>
<p>(New York) The 48 states of the United States are scheduled to hold general elections and congressional elections tomorrow. Between 42 million and 45 million voters will participate in the voting. They will elect (1) 531 election representatives, that is, one representative is elected for every 279,712 citizens; (2) 467 members of Congress, that is, 435 members of the House of Representatives and one-third of the senators, totaling 32; and (3) 33 governors. According to the American general election, a two-stage election system is used. First, voters in each state elect "election representatives," which is the primary election. Then, the election representatives will elect a president and vice president each in the state capitals on December 14 of this year, which is the second election. During the primary election, if a political party can win a majority of the votes in a state, then all the election representatives in that state will belong to that party. For example, the state of New York has a total of 10 million voters. If Party A gets only ten more votes than Party B, then all 47 election representatives in that state will belong to Party A. This determines the general election. The parties participating in the competition include the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. Among them, the Socialist and Communist parties have very little power and are not worth mentioning. Therefore, the situation of this competition should be the same as in previous elections. In other words, it is a contest between the Democratic candidate, President Roosevelt, and the Republican candidate, Kansas Governor Landon. As for the campaign speeches delivered by President Roosevelt and Governor Landon, most of them are about domestic issues, and rarely mention foreign policy. Only once did Landon criticize the current government's foreign trade policy, that is, the reciprocal trade agreements established between the United States and various countries. Later, Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Interior Ickes successively responded, saying that the reciprocal trade agreements would not only be maintained, but that similar agreements should also be signed with other countries in the future. If we speculate on the election results, both the Democratic and Republican parties claim to be confident of victory. According to the New York Times, the election situation in the major states is still uncertain, among which the state of New York is the most important (the state of New York will elect as many as 47 election representatives). The states of Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, and Texas are decisive. If the Republican Party can win in these four states, then Landon has a chance of being elected. In short, President Roosevelt's hope of being elected is the strongest. Also, during tomorrow's election, most places will still have voters fill out election ballots and put them in ballot boxes, and then count them, as in the past. However, in major cities, such as New York City, special machines will be used to automatically calculate the votes in order to make it more convenient. This is also a feature of this election.

<h3 id="e60">Roosevelt and Landon Deliver Final Campaign Speeches: Both are Concerned about Freedom and Democracy <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Tomorrow is the date of the primary election. Democratic candidate President Roosevelt and Republican candidate Kansas Governor Landon both delivered radio speeches on the evening of this day, about fifteen minutes each, to end the campaign. President Roosevelt delivered his speech at his hometown of Hyde Park, New York (the Roosevelt family has voted there in every election for more than a hundred years). He said, "There is a trend in some parts of the world that threatens to engulf democratic systems, but in our America, people still believe in democracy as before and have not been moved by it. The majority rules the minority, which is the law recognized by the United States. We firmly uphold the traditional ideas and experiences of the United States for our own reasons. The election is tomorrow, and when you vote, you must put aside thoughts of gratitude and grievances, and promote the prosperity and welfare of the United States as the only goal. Governor Landon's speech was delivered at his private residence in Topeka, the capital of Kansas. He said, "The nation will accept a major responsibility tomorrow. The situation is such that there is a need to form a free and democratic line in the world, and we must uphold this line, which is our inescapable responsibility." (2nd, Havas News)</p>
<p>Hyde Park: President Roosevelt addressed American voters in his famous "fireside chat" tonight to end his election campaign, warning voters not to act against their conscience and be afraid when voting tomorrow, saying, "Whoever is elected tomorrow will ultimately be the president of all the people, so it is appropriate not to be afraid of electing the person you consider perfect in your mind. Moreover, the election is a personal matter, and others can never blame you for not choosing what they want. We are all equal before the ballot box." Roosevelt also praised the open methods of the opposition party, saying that the people can understand the current points of contention, which is very beneficial to the democratic system. The American citizens of 1936 are the products of a free system, and I am not afraid of the threats of politicians or the ambitions of dictators, because they can hardly use their skills for long in nations with freedom of thought and freedom of action. (2nd, National News Agency)</p>
<p>Topeka: Republican presidential candidate Landon delivered his last speech here tonight on the eve of the general election, saying, "When you vote tomorrow, you should vote as Americans for the future of Americans. We must strictly adhere to the line of democracy and dare not slacken. When you vote tomorrow, you should be determined to uphold the three principles on which the American people rely to be great, namely, love of freedom, enthusiasm for justice, and humanitarian habits." This speech was broadcast nationally by the radio station in Topeka, the capital of Kansas. (2nd, National News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e61">American Seamen's Strike: Claiming Communist Agitation; Number of Strikers Increases to 100,000; Government May Take Strong Measures <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(New York) The seamen's strike is expanding, and it is said that communists are instigating it. The Seamen's Union here announced today that 133 ships are currently out of service on the Atlantic coast. About 10,000 seamen are striking on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. Most ships from Europe will also be out of service after arriving here in the future. The mail ship Manhattan and the Virginia have canceled their schedules, so 21 ships here have stopped. The Seamen's Union held a secret meeting today. International Seamen's Union Director Crum stated that if the shipowners request assistance from the Navy and Customs Enforcement, the union will announce a general strike. (2nd, National News)</p>
<p>(New York) Third Vice President Grange of the International Seamen's Union issued a statement today, strongly criticizing the current shipping strike as an illegal movement organized by the Communist Party. He has planned to supply sailors to the ships that are out of service so that the strike cannot last long. This dispute is a struggle between communism and Americanism. At the same time, the San Francisco Seamen's Union has ordered the strike to be extended to all parts of the country. (3rd, Reuters News)</p>
<p>Philadelphia: Philadelphia Mayor Wilson announced today that the national seamen's strike is illegal, and ten pickets have been arrested and imprisoned. (2nd, National News)</p>
<p>(San Francisco) The strike on the Pacific coast has now spread to related industries. By Wednesday, 100,000 people will be out of work, so the government may take "strong measures" to stop it. Labor Secretary McGrady, who was ordered to come here to preside over labor-management negotiations, said today that the seamen's strike is a challenge to national welfare, and announced that the capitalists intend to ask the Navy to provide "safe crew members" to protect perishable goods, and said, "Now water transportation has been blocked, which will directly and indirectly affect the lives of the people across the country. The government must crack down on any organization, labor or management, whose actions endanger national welfare in order to protect the country and the people." Today, the capitalists initially decided to express their willingness not to strike, but to operate the ships on their own. Although there is no such plan at present, it is believed that ships must be protected from fire and other dangers. This confirms the saying that the capitalists may order a small number of sailors to board the ships. The suspension of shipping has spread to the Atlantic coast and the ports of the Gulf of Mexico. Eighteen ships are holding sympathy strikes in the port of New York, and another fifty-nine ships are holding strikes in other ports on the Atlantic coast. The total number of strikers reaches more than 5,000. More than 5,000 people are also striking in the Gulf of Mexico. (2nd, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) The labor unrest has now spread to the Atlantic coast and the ports of the Gulf of Mexico, threatening the entire American shipping industry. The Shipping Committee is conducting a thorough investigation in San Francisco today to try to break the deadlock, but the representatives of the Pacific branch of the Seamen's Union angrily left the meeting, saying that they opposed the investigation and refused to submit the case. However, the committee continued to listen to the report and did not stop because of their withdrawal. The American largest airship Virginia, which was scheduled to sail to the Pacific coast tomorrow, has canceled due to the seamen's strike, and the 500 passengers on board have disembarked and returned home. The ship is the 19th ship affected by the strike. The American Steamship Owners Association has convened a meeting of American shipping leaders to consider the overall situation. Several ports, such as Philadelphia and Boston, have successively held strikes. In Boston, the crew of the engine room of the mail ship New York completely left the ship a few minutes before departure, preventing it from departing. The 300 passengers on board were sent to New York by train. The situation in the port of New York is very quiet. No pickets are stationed at the wharf, and the dispatched police have nothing to do. The International Seamen's Union announced that the shipowners have agreed to increase wages by an average of 20% in the ports between Wilmington, North Carolina, and Tampa, Florida. The shipowners took this action because there are also signs of a strike in the Southeast. The mail ship Manhattan, which was scheduled to sail to Europe on Wednesday, has canceled its schedule due to the seamen's strike, and the ship fares paid by the 350 passengers have been refunded. (2nd, Reuters News)</p>
<p>(New York) The International Seamen's Union here immediately announced a slowdown in support, causing 20,000 seamen on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts to stop working, resulting in 107 ships being unable to sail, including as many as 26 ships anchored in the port of New York. (2nd, Havas News)</p>
<p>Honolulu: All ships in this port have announced a strike in sympathy with the American shipping strike. It is heard that some travelers traveling around the world are stranded here as a result, including two American consuls to China. Due to the suspension of ships, the mail volume of the Clipper flying boat across the Pacific has surged. (2nd, Reuters News)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Chaozhou-Shantou People Appeal for Reduction and Exemption of Harsh Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies; Local Areas Arbitrarily Impose Taxes, Resulting in Multiple Taxes on a Single Item; Marriage of Daughters Requires Tax Payment, Otherwise Considered Abduction; Various Harsh and Miscellaneous Levies Emerge Endlessly <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: After the renewal of the Guangdong administration, the government immediately implemented the abolition of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies to alleviate the people's suffering. However, in the Chaozhou and Meizhou counties, there are numerous types of harsh taxes and miscellaneous levies, and the amount collected and its usage are largely unclear. The collectors of these taxes and levies are mostly county councils, district and township offices, guard teams, police districts, autonomous offices, schools, local public organizations, party headquarters, and other institutions. Currently, the county councils and party headquarters have ceased operations, and district and township autonomous organizations have also been suspended. The guard teams will be downsized into security forces, and police districts will remain as before. Various harsh and miscellaneous taxes, such as land tax surcharges, should be reduced. However, the counties still maintain countless taxes, leading to indescribable suffering for the people. The item of rice alone is subject to multiple taxes. On the 26th, the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, the North-South Trade Association, and others sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the prior exemption of special taxes on imported rice to alleviate the people's food shortage. The original telegram stated, "Upon investigation, domestic rice has been snatched up by Japanese merchants everywhere, resulting in empty stocks and skyrocketing prices. Currently, there is little rice stored in Chaozhou and Meizhou, and coupled with the disaster of drought and locusts, the autumn harvest is worrisome. The price of rice has risen from six yuan to ten yuan per dan (a unit of weight), causing widespread panic. If no replenishment is made in advance, there is no way to stabilize the people's hearts. We humbly request that the import of foreign rice into Chaozhou and Meizhou be temporarily exempted from special taxes, so that it can be purchased and imported to stabilize prices and alleviate the famine." Furthermore, various public associations in Chaoyang County and other counties telegraphed the provincial government to abolish harsh levies and surcharges, stating, "The Guangdong government is corrupt, and incompetent and greedy officials fill the political arena, colluding with each other. For years, they have been imposing excessive taxes and levies, with hundreds of tax items emerging, making it impossible for the people to survive. Leaving aside provincial and national taxes, various local taxes and levies are such that almost every item is taxed multiple times, with unbearable harshness and complexity. The organizers claim the levies are for autonomous expenses, relief funds, or security needs, creating clever names and arbitrarily imposing taxes, draining the people's resources and causing the collapse of all industries, akin to exhausting the pond to catch all the fish. The strong are driven to take risks, while the weak are left to fill the ditches. Public resentment is boiling, and cries of anguish fill the air. Our association and others find it difficult to remain silent, and after the fifth board meeting, it was resolved to list the names of various taxes and levies that should be abolished and submit them to the Guangdong Provincial Committee for the Abolition of Harsh Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies, requesting a review and abolition to alleviate the people's suffering." According to investigations, in addition to legitimate taxes and levies, each county has over a hundred types of harsh and miscellaneous levies, and each district and township has over twenty types. For example, in rural villages, when a woman gets married, there are so-called "daughter's departure tax," "new bride flower tax," "marriage certificate tax," "district office certificate stamp fee," "dowry tax," "face powder tax," "ceremonial guard tax," "drum and music tax," "wedding banquet tax," "matchmaker commission tax," and "auspicious and inauspicious occasions tax." Not only are wealthy families afraid to formally marry under the weight of these overlapping harsh levies, but poor families also lack the qualifications to enjoy the joy of a new marriage. For example, if a rural woman formally marries through a matchmaker, the bride price is eighty yuan. When the matchmaker delivers the ancestral records, they must register with the district office and obtain a marriage certificate, costing four yuan, plus a four-cent stamp. The matchmaker and an additional matchmaker receive eight yuan, plus an additional eight yuan for the matchmaker's commission, with the bride's and groom's families each contributing four yuan. Otherwise, the matchmaker's qualifications will be revoked, and the marriage will not be considered a formal marriage with proper betrothal gifts. Furthermore, before setting the auspicious day, a departure tax of four yuan must be paid before the bride can leave the house, otherwise, it will be considered abduction. When the woman boards the bridal sedan chair, the sedan chair carriers must first pay the tax to the tax bureau before they can carry the sedan chair to the bride's home; otherwise, it will be considered smuggling and tax evasion, and the sedan chair shop and carriers will be punished and disqualified from their profession. The sedan chair tax ranges from two to four yuan per chair. Unless the bride walks on foot, she cannot avoid paying this tax. However, according to village customs, walking on foot is not allowed in the village. If the new bride has a clothing chest with her, it is called the dowry tax, which is charged at two to four cents per load. Wealthy people who marry off their daughters may be charged dozens of yuan. If there are drums, music, and ceremonial guards in front of the bride's sedan chair, there are additional taxes, costing one yuan per set, with a double charge for those with gongs. The tax for auspicious and inauspicious occasions is for the purpose of settling wandering vagrants and beggars. The family hosting the wedding must pay over ten or twenty yuan to avoid the misery of disturbance at the door. Relatives who come to congratulate bring wedding banquets, and the kitchen dishes are assessed by the banquet tax inspector. Those with shark fin, abalone, and sea cucumber are charged an additional two percent, while those with pork, chicken, and fish are charged an additional one percent. Each table of food costs at least one yuan in tax, and the chefs and restaurant owners are responsible. If one prepares the banquet oneself, one must first notify the tax bureau for inspection. In short, those who know even a little about the suffering caused by harsh levies to the people of Chaozhou and Meizhou cannot help but stick out their tongues in dismay. For example, many farming families rely on raising pigs as a sideline. From the time the boar is used for breeding, there are the following taxes: "breeding tax," "piglet tax," "piglet bar tax" (when piglets are sold), "weighing commission tax," "big pig tax," "pig manure boat tax," "slaughter tax," "meat stall tax," "health inspection tax" (failure to inspect will be considered inflating the pigs), "pig bristle tax," "pig oil export tax," and "banquet tax." Even after being eaten and turned into feces, one must still pay the "feces and urine tax" to the collective agricultural company. Therefore, it is no wonder that the people of Chaozhou and Shantou are calling for tax reductions and lighter levies.</p>
<h3 id="e65">During the Japanese Army's Grand Maneuvers, a Banquet at Huai Ren Hall; Tashiro Kan'ichiro Attends Inspection; Song Zheyuan Hosts a Grand Banquet, Frankly Discussing Sincere Cooperation; The Evening Concludes with Chinese and Western Songs <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The North China Garrison Army of Japan held its autumn grand maneuvers. The 2nd was the eighth day, and all Japanese soldiers were concentrated in Tong County for rest. All schools, hotels, theaters, and other places were full of Japanese soldiers. Many students of the Tong County Normal School came from other places. The school was occupied, so the local authorities gave each student two yuan to find their own place to live, and they would return to school after the maneuvers were over. The Japanese Army Headquarters was located in the special agency in the rice warehouse. Tashiro Kan'ichiro, the commander, arrived in Peiping by express train from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 2nd. The scene at the station was not as serious as last time. In addition to several dozen Chinese and Japanese welcomers, including Qin Dechun, Chen Juesheng, Chen Zhongfu, Chen Jiyan, Matsumuro, Kato, and Kuwabara, there were no Japanese soldiers guarding the station. After getting off the train, Tashiro went to the Fusang Hall to rest briefly, and then went to Huai Ren Hall in Zhongnanhai at 12:30 to attend the banquet hosted by Song Zheyuan. After the banquet, he took a car to Tong County. At about 3:00, he summoned Hashimoto and other responsible persons such as Shinagawa to the headquarters to inquire in detail about the locations of the maneuvering troops and all preparations for the general maneuvers on the 3rd.</p>
<p>When Song held a banquet for Tashiro at Huai Ren Hall, he also invited important figures from all walks of life and various institutions to accompany them. The Japanese attendees included Tashiro, Matsumuro, Imamura, Hamada, Imai, Nakajima, Sakurai, Satani, Yamamine, Nishida, Matsuo, Kuwabara, Kato, Akato, and Hirai. The Chinese attendees included the host Song Zheyuan, as well as Qi Xieyuan, Jia Deyao, Qin Dechun, Jiang Menglin, Li Zheng, Xu Songming, Li Linyu, Zhou Jingwen, Qi Dapeng, Men Zhizhong, Tang Erhe, Deng Zhexi, Shi Yousan, Hu Yukun, Chen Zhongfu, Chen Juesheng, Niu Chuanshan, Leng Jiaji, Zhang Shizhao, Liu Chunlin, Liu Zhizhou, Lu Zongyu, Zhu Shen, Li Mingzhong, Liu Yufen, Pan Yugui, Guo Zhihan, Ge Dingyuan, Lei Sishang, Wang Xicheng, Yue Qianzhai, Zou Quansun, Fu Zhankui, Sun Weihao, Zhang Weifan, Shao Wenkai, Chen Jiyan, Lin Shize, Wang Lengzhai, Guan Yixian and others, totaling more than eighty people. The meal was Chinese food. After taking their seats, Song stood up and delivered a speech, which was translated by Chen Zhongfu, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. His speech stated, "Today, Commander Tashiro has arrived in Peiping. I would like to take this opportunity to prepare a simple meal and wine to show my respect as the host, and to invite Chinese and Japanese people to accompany us, to have a friendly gathering and introduce each other. China and Japan are two major Asian nations and brotherly countries, sharing common interests. China has a vast territory and abundant resources, but its development is backward, which is the focus of world attention. Japan has a strong national power and rapid development, which is also the focus of world attention. Both countries are struggling and striving in the world, and it is natural for them to coexist and prosper. Sincere cooperation based on equality between the two countries is a common understanding among people with insight in both countries, and there is no need to elaborate. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council has been established for a year, and we have been working towards this goal, advocating peace internally and externally, opposing communist riots, and maintaining social order with sincerity and fairness in order to achieve progress. However, there have been doubts in society over the past year. The first doubt is that Japan is invading North China, and the second doubt is that the North China authorities have any secrets with the Japanese side. Regarding the first point, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly and solemnly stated that they have no intention of invading North China's land and sovereignty. Regarding the second point, since the establishment of this political council, North China has had no secrets with Japan. The opening of transportation, postal services, and navigation are all continuations of previous unfinished negotiations. We are seeking to achieve the goal of sincere cooperation based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. I would like to sincerely state this during this toast with Commander Tashiro, so that it may be known and believed by all parties."</p>
<p>After Song finished his speech, he raised his glass to Tashiro to propose a toast, and everyone applauded. Tashiro stood up in the applause to deliver a reply, which was also translated by Chen Zhongfu. He stated, "I have come to Peiping for the autumn maneuvers, and I would like to take this opportunity to accept Chairman Song's invitation to a banquet and to meet leaders from all walks of life. I am deeply honored. I would also like to express my gratitude to Chairman Song and all aspects of your country for providing various conveniences for the autumn maneuvers. The houses and all utensils needed during the maneuvers were all helped by the Chinese people. This further demonstrates that Chairman Song and the Chinese people deeply understand the friendship and relations between China and Japan. Therefore, I would like to express my deep gratitude. The points Chairman Song mentioned regarding the relationship between China and Japan are generally consistent with my feelings. Chairman Song said that China and Japan should cooperate sincerely based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit. This is extremely pertinent. I admire Chairman Song's patriotic and caring zeal. In the past, there have inevitably been imperfections in the relationship between the two societies, which have led to misunderstandings, and there have always been people who intentionally slander. In my opinion, facts speak louder than words, and in the end, they are not worth the laughter of those in the know. I have several things that can prove this. First, when I first arrived in Tianjin to take office, there were rumors that Japan had some kind of action against Hebei and Chahar. Now that much time has passed, there is complete factual evidence to show that these rumors have been completely shattered. Second, when the Fengtai incident occurred, someone deliberately spread rumors, but it was finally resolved due to mutual understanding. This is another example not worth laughing at. Third, with this Japanese autumn maneuvers, there are rumors that Japan wants to take this opportunity to take action. Newspapers everywhere have records of this. Now, what is the reality? The outside world should already be fully aware. In short, misunderstandings are ultimately misunderstandings, and rumors are ultimately rumors. The events of the three eastern provinces will never be seen in Hebei and Chahar. However, rumors do not come from nowhere, or perhaps some people do not want the Hebei-Chahar authorities to implement friendly relations with Japan, so they create all kinds of rumors in an attempt to undermine them. Rumors stop at the wise, and there is no need to defend them. Chairman Song's enthusiasm for the country is seen by all. I have a thorough understanding of the greatness of Chairman Song's personality. Chairman Song advocates that China and Japan should implement friendly relations, and I fully support lasting friendship. I would also like to do my best to facilitate and introduce them in order to promote them. Now, I would like to use the host's wine to wish Chairman Song good health, and to wish good health to everyone present." After Tashiro finished his reply, everyone applauded. Chinese and Western music was then played, including "Ten Thousand Years Song," "Drunken Peace," and "March," "Friendly Banquet," and "Happy Guests." The hosts and guests had a pleasant conversation and drink, and the gathering ended happily at 2:00 in the afternoon. (2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Request for Re-examination of Bad Monk Rejected <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Lianchi Temple on Wufeng Mountain in Mutu Township, Wuxian County, is one of the famous monasteries in Suzhou, with a flourishing incense offering. The abbot of the temple, Monk Kuanlu, privately built a secret room and engaged in improper behavior. The Wuxian Public Security Bureau verified this and ordered the expulsion of the bad monk, and the district office was ordered to select a replacement to take over. However, the monk resisted the transfer and refused to meet. On one hand, he pleaded with the monks of major temples to submit a petition to the county government to delay the sealing of the temple, but this was rejected. The township Baojia chief Ding Renlin and others believe that the township patrol officer is protecting the bad monk, so they submitted a petition to the county government on the 2nd to dismiss his followers. Kuanlu also submitted a petition to the county government, claiming that the Public Security Bureau's investigation was inaccurate and requesting that a qualified official be appointed to conduct a thorough re-examination to clarify the truth. The county government issued a reply on the 3rd, stating that the Public Security Bureau had already been ordered to carry out the expulsion and report it to the Second District Administrative Inspector's Office of Jiangsu Province, and that the Second District Office had been ordered to recruit a replacement. The request for re-examination should not be discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Two Cases Filed and Handed Over to the County for Investigation <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The First Branch of the Fifth Public Security Bureau discovered a den selling opium in Niuchangshang, Shanrenqiao Township, and confiscated eight packages of opium, smoking paraphernalia, and other items. Two opium traffickers, Cao Tuquan and his mother, Cao Chou, were arrested. The First Public Security Bureau also discovered eleven packages of opium and smoking paraphernalia at No. 81 Xiatang, Qimen, and arrested two opium traffickers, Gong Houqing and Zhang Shaozhen. After the above two cases of criminals were sent to the General Bureau, they were transferred to the county government on the 3rd and detained separately for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Jiading: Car Overturns into River <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>At about 5:00 p.m. on the 1st, a Shanghainese man was driving his own sedan-style car back to Shanghai after traveling in Taicang. When passing by Huizhaqiao south of Malu Station in this county, the driver neglected his duty due to the windy and rainy weather and dark skies, and overturned into the river west of the road. The eight men and women in the car fell into the river with the car. The road workers repairing the road on the Xihu Road went to rescue them. Two of the children were already on the verge of death, but fortunately, there were no major injuries. After being rescued, they went to Nanxiang to change cars and return to Shanghai. The next day, a crane was dispatched from Shanghai to Jiading to salvage the car that had fallen into the river. However, due to the great weight, it could not be salvaged. To this day, the car is still in the river.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Memorial Monument Scheduled for Unveiling <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Hou Tongzeng and Huang Tao'an, two martyrs of this county, advocated defending the city in righteousness during the late Ming Dynasty. They were unyielding during the Three Massacres and eventually died for their country. At a time when the country is in great difficulty, it is necessary to commend them. Therefore, educational staff and school students donated thousands of yuan to build the Hou Huang Two Loyal and Righteous Public Memorial Monument in Kuishan Park, which has now been completed. It is now scheduled to hold a grand unveiling ceremony on November 6th, the local memorial day. Wang Gongyu, the third administrative inspector commissioner, has been invited to Jiading to unveil the monument. A notice has been sent to all walks of life, and a grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Changshu: The Bandit Gang of the Meili Robbery <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Wang Xiangjiu and Gao Yunpan's family, wealthy households in Meili Tangqiao, were robbed by bandits a few weeks ago, suffering losses of three to four thousand gold. After the investigation team worked hard to investigate, Chen Youliang and Wang Agen were captured in the Shanghai Concession. They have now been brought to Changshu. The victims, Wang and Gao, went to the bureau to identify them and confirmed that they were the perpetrators. The clothes worn by the Wang bandit and the leather shoes worn by the Chen bandit were indeed the items lost by the family. With this ironclad evidence, the two bandits knew it was difficult to deny and immediately confessed that they had committed a total of nine robberies, including the houses of He Fu in Yaozhen, He Fengxi in Hejiashi, and He She in Taoshe. The gang confessed that they were lake bandits from the Xianzi Mountain gang in the Taihu Lake area of Suzhou, totaling four to five hundred people. The investigation team has confirmed the confession and is now coordinating with the authorities to apprehend the remaining bandits. The captured criminals will be handed over to the county judicial authorities for review.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Changzhou: Two Banks Exchange Copper Coins <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The eight industries of Wujin County, including wine sauce and cigarettes, previously had an overabundance of copper coins in circulation, causing financial stagnation. They jointly sent the accumulated copper coins to the Changzhou branches of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications for exchange. Subsequently, Chiang Wei-hsien, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, agreed with the authorities of the two branches to exchange 10,000 yuan first within one week, and convened representatives of the eight industries on the 30th of last month to discuss the distribution plan and whether it was necessary to retain the balance to facilitate the exchange of other industries. It was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would first complete the exchange before discussing the distribution method. The County Chamber of Commerce then sent a letter to the two branches requesting them to send personnel to the meeting to collect the exchange. Yesterday (2nd), the two branches sent personnel to begin inspecting the exchange, but the procedures are extremely complicated and will take half a month to complete.</p>

<p>Yesterday (1st) at 7:00 or 8:00 a.m., Yang Yuanchang's paper candle shop in Dongdai, Tongli Town, Wujiang County, caught fire carelessly, and the flames burst through the roof and could not be stopped. The fire spread to over thirty houses across the street, including Mabaohe Silver Shop, Jinlun Foreign Goods Store, Nantaitai Native Products Store in Nandai, Yuankang Clothing Store, Dechang Beijing Goods Store, and Fuan Tea House. Although the fire brigades from various sections tried their best to put out the fire, the streets were too narrow and the wind and fire were dry, making it difficult to extinguish. The shops in this section are the busiest in the town, with losses exceeding 200,000 yuan. The fire was not extinguished until 12:00 a.m. The public security branch is investigating the cause of the fire in order to determine responsibility.</p>

<p>Shen Qingchen from Gushan, Wudong, the current manager of the Licheng Steamboat Bureau, was arrested and detained by the county in the case of Song Qichen, the owner of Changjing, selling red pill drugs last year, and was sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment and a fine of 1,000 yuan by the Provincial Garrison Headquarters. He has served fourteen months. In August, the trial judge Shen Yuan suddenly granted bail, and someone accused Judge Shen of illegally releasing the key drug criminal, with suspicion of bribery. The High Court then ordered the Wuxi District Court to send Judge Lai Sihe to Cheng yesterday (2nd) to investigate the county government, and inquired in detail with the guarantor Cai Xuelin and the enforcement policeman Zhu Qixin. There were already clues about this case, and he returned to Wuxi in the afternoon to report.</p>

<p>The Xicheng long-distance bus, which departed from Wuxi to Cheng at about 12:00 a.m. on the 1st, had a Japanese man dressed in Chinese casual clothes. After arriving in Cheng from Wuxi, the police officers stationed at the station asked about his whereabouts. He took out a passport stating his name as Nakajima and that he was traveling to Jiangsu Province. The Public Security Bureau then sent a police officer to protect him. The Japanese man entered the city and went to Shengyi Bowl Shop on Dongda Street to collect debts. Later, it was learned that he was indeed a merchant from Yongxingtai Shop in Suzhou. He left Cheng for Wuxi in the afternoon and returned to Suzhou.</p>

<p>The land tax for 1936 in Jiangdu was announced on the 1st. However, the notice forms were sent to various districts and townships not long ago, so the landowners have not received them widely, and few have paid. All partially reduced land, totaling over 440,000 mu, with a tax reduction of over 40,000 yuan, will also be announced separately by the county. All land with inconsistent land tax has been reported to the provincial government, and approval is pending for correction in the next year.

<p>The area from Zhenjiang to Jurong is undulating with mountains and continuous mountains. In previous years, it was known as the most desolate and dangerous area. Since the opening of Zhenju Road, it has become a major artery for traffic between Nanjing and Zhenjiang. The population has increased, and the number of travelers is dense. Tigers and leopards have disappeared, and bandits have disappeared. However, the area around Qiaojiamenxi Huifeng An Fenlonggang Lime Kiln is still steep and densely covered with weeds, and there are still wild beasts lurking. Recently, Secretary-General Luo of the Provincial Government saw a tiger with mottled patterns and a body like a calf when he passed the Fenlonggang Lime Kiln area by private car. When he saw the car, he fled into the mountains in surprise. Yesterday, Chen Zhongxi also saw this beast in the same place when he went to Nanjing via Jurong. If no measures are taken to hunt and kill it, it will seriously affect the safety of the villagers. Yesterday, Zhang, the magistrate of Zhenjiang, was specially instructed to instruct his subordinates and nearby hunters to find a way to capture it, so as to avoid harming people and livestock and ensure the safety of the villages.</p>

<p>Jiaxing had been without rain for a long time, the rivers dried up, and the fields cracked. Many crops in the countryside, such as beans and vegetables, withered. The late rice also couldn't mature fully due to lack of rain. Beans and wheat couldn't even be sown. Residents also lacked drinking water, making it difficult to fetch water. The air was dry, causing eye and throat ailments. People had been hoping for rain for a long time. It finally began to drizzle around 2 AM three days ago, and there was still a hint of rain at noon. The countryside rejoiced at this rain. From now on, beans, wheat, and other crops can be sown, and the spread of common ailments can also be slightly suppressed.</p>

<p>The southeastern border of Zhejiang Province is adjacent to Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. Due to its location in high mountains and inconvenient transportation, bandit gangs often emerged. To facilitate the suppression of bandits, the Construction Department has strictly ordered the construction of various highways to be expedited. (1) The Lishui to Songyang section has been fully completed and opened to traffic, and commercial operations began at the end of October, with excellent results. (2) The original road surface of the Songyang to Suichang section has been completed and only needs to be tidied up and bridges built. It can be completed by the end of December. (3) Earthwork for the Yongjia, Ruian, and Pingyang road was once collected from civilian laborers, but work was suspended midway due to some reason. Now, it has been decided to continue construction and complete the entire project by the end of the year.</p>

<p>The autumn harvest in Zhejiang Province this year has been abundant in various counties, and the output of agricultural products has increased. However, rice prices have risen daily, causing considerable panic among ordinary people. The authorities learned that a large quantity of rice was being shipped out of Jiaxing, Pinghu, Jiashan, and other rice-producing areas in Zhejiang, supposedly for export overseas. Therefore, they ordered the counties to seize all rice to maintain the food supply for the people. Now, after merchants appealed and it was verified that the rice was being transported to Shanghai for sale and certified by the Chamber of Commerce, the Civil Affairs Department has ordered the counties to allow the release for export to facilitate the circulation of food and regulate the market.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Ningbo Ban on Exporting Food Grains <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Zhenhai County government, considering that the county's food supply is insufficient and sometimes relies on imports from other counties for relief, has always strictly prohibited unauthorized exports. However, recently, some unscrupulous merchants, only concerned with profit and disregarding the people's food supply, have been secretly smuggling goods for export. Yesterday, special instructions were issued to the heads of each Public Security Bureau to supervise the police at stations and wharves to pay special attention. If anyone lacks a transportation permit issued by the government and promulgated by the province, regardless of whether they have declared and paid taxes, they will be immediately detained. At the same time, a letter was sent to the customs and various shipping companies to jointly prevent it.</p>

<h3 id="e88">British World Games Football Report Claims: British New Tactics Not Superior, Strongly Advocates the Need to Re-Adopt Old Methods, Football Association Revises Referee Memorandum <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London -- A major surprise at the British Football Association Congress was the report on the British football team's disastrous defeat in Berlin. The report strongly stated that the British style of play is not superior to other countries. The "W" formation does not find favor in most European countries.</p>
<p>The report, signed by Wallraf White and Rose, clearly expresses the opinion of most British officials that the methods adopted by Austria, Norway, and Poland are more effective than those of Britain.</p>
<p>The report stated that, in general, the old method, with its emphasis on attack over defense, has proven to be more effective, and the game is certainly more interesting to watch. There is considerable reason to believe that British professional teams will revert to the football style they had for a long time in the past this season. The initial change was entirely to adapt to the changed offside rule. If this is indeed the case, the results of British international football matches will inevitably improve accordingly. This time, the discussions in Berlin between senior British football officials and the International Football Association on various issues arising in international football management are considered a serious matter. Therefore, it may allow the British Football Association to rejoin the International Football Association. Currently, the two sides have only established a "gentleman's agreement" on exchanging players. Another result of the British Football Association Congress was the publication of a revised memorandum regarding linesmen and referees, which contains clear instructions on how to work. The "diagonal" system favored by the Referees Committee allows referees to always know the position of their assistants. There should be extremely close cooperation among these three officials.</p>
<p>Instructions for Referees</p>
<p>The memorandum makes several important conclusions regarding the referee's management of players, with the following specific instructions:</p>
<p>(1) Referees can exercise their own discretion in dealing with rough actions and are authorized to stop them in various ways.</p>
<p>(2) When a player is cautioned, the player's name and the word "caution" must be used simultaneously, and the player must be made aware that this is their last chance.</p>
<p>(3) When warning or verbally cautioning a player, the referee should not point a finger or place their hand on any player.</p>
<p>(4) Referees must stop rough behavior at the outset.</p>
<p>(5) Referees must punish intentional acts, not unintentional ones.</p>
<p>(6) After issuing a ruling, the referee cannot change it. If there are any doubts, they should consult with the linesmen before issuing the ruling.</p>
<p>(7) Players must not obstruct the referee's decisions. Those who obstruct or express anger must be cautioned.</p>
<p>(8) Referees should not discuss or debate incidents with players or officials on the field, nor should they discuss or debate with any players off the field.</p>
<p>(9) Any penalty that favors the side committing a foul should not be implemented. The memorandum pays special attention to the game method of "wasting time," which is completely contrary to the spirit of the game and has become noteworthy.</p>
<p>When taking free kicks and throw-ins, players kick the ball wildly to allow their team to regain their position and monitor their opponents. The memorandum considers this habit childish and annoying and asks referees to firmly deal with such actions that violate the spirit of football.</p>

<p>The seventh Municipal Middle School Sports Federation Tennis Championship, with the participation of four schools including Private Shanghai, Fushi, Guanghua, and Shanghai Jiang, began its preliminary round the day before yesterday. Private Shanghai and Fushi were both eliminated. Shanghai Jiang and Guanghua, who qualified for the finals, were delayed by rain the day before yesterday and only held the finals at the Municipal Sports Field at 2:00 PM yesterday. As a result, Shanghai Jiang won two singles matches, and Guanghua won the doubles match. The overall result was 2-1, and Shanghai Jiang won the championship. According to previous reports, the champion was Guanghua High School, and the previous champion was Shanghai Jiang. In total, Shanghai Jiang has retained two championship titles. The battle results are as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Baojia Defeats Xiong Dazuan First Single: Shanghai Jiang's Tang Baojia vs. Guanghua's Xiong Dazuan. Tang was injured playing basketball the night before and could barely take a step yesterday. His ball skills were not as sluggish as in the hard-court cycle week the day before. Xiong is one of Guanghua's fierce generals and was quite unwilling to submit. In the first set, he resisted Tang in every way. Tang narrowly took advantage of him midway, handled it carefully afterward, and finally defeated Xiong 6-3 in the first set. Tang's spirit was even stronger in the second set, invincible, and won another slippery set, thus winning 2-0.</p>
<p>Chen Dexian Defeats Wang Tianduo Shanghai Jiang's Chen met Guanghua's Wang in the second single. The strength of both sides was equal, and there were many wonderful and tense moments. The first set was even more difficult to separate, with frequent ties. Chen, with his accurate landing points, won three consecutive games and ended the set 7-5. In the second set, Wang's spirit was greatly reduced. After winning two games, he immediately collapsed and lost again 6-2. The overall result was 2-0, and the championship was lost from then on.</p>
<p>Guanghua Wins One Doubles Match The final doubles match was irrelevant to the overall result. Shanghai Jiang sent Xu Peizhi and Zhang Dechang, who had defeated Fushi with two 6-3 scores the day before. Their ball skills were experienced, and they immediately gave Guanghua's Feng Zhuomin and Sun Luofang a blow with a 6-1 score. However, Feng and Sun were not discouraged by this, calmly responded, and finally tied the score 6-1, making the autumn colors evenly divided. The final deciding set was even more exciting. From 4-4 to 5-5, and then 6-6, Feng and Sun cooperated effectively and finally completed two games in one go, achieving success with a score of 8-6. The overall result was 2-1, Guanghua winning the doubles.</p>

<p>The Capital Amateur Sports Association, with famous players such as Ma Shaobo, Li Pizu, and Zhao Minheng, has greatly improved the level of tennis in the capital. Last month, in the "Shouru Cup" battle, the Shanghai team concentrated on sending second-tier players to Beijing for the first Shouru Cup Beijing-Shanghai confrontation, but due to Shanghai's misarrangement of the order, they suffered a setback with a score of 1-6. This time, the tennis players from Beijing took advantage of their visit to Shanghai to watch Lefebvre's performance and received enthusiastic support from Mr. Chen Jianru, Director of the Beijing Social Bureau, who donated a silver cup to reward the winning team. The morale of both sides was further boosted. Therefore, Zhao Minheng contacted Chen Qihao in advance and, during his stay in Shanghai, held the second Beijing-Shanghai confrontation with the Chinese Club athletes, competing in five singles matches and two doubles matches to compete for the "Jianru Cup." The Chinese Club will make every effort to cope with the competition this time. The competition will be fierce, and the excitement is predictable. The location is the Chinese Club court on Singapore Road. No tickets will be sold, and anyone can visit. The Beijing team welcomes other tennis groups in Shanghai to arrange competitions in order to learn from each other. If anyone is interested in accepting the invitation, please send a letter to Mr. Chen Qihao (4th floor, 20 Guangdong Road) in advance to make arrangements. The initially determined lineup is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e100">Most Popular Public Reading Material: Shanghai Comic Book Industry, Over a Thousand Products, Mostly Focused on Gods and Monsters, Ministry of Education is Planning to Improve and Promote Social Education <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Comic books are the most popular reading material among the public, especially those published in Shanghai. However, most of the content is supernatural novels, which has a significant impact on the promotion of social education. The Ministry of Education is now working to improve this. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Publication Types The content of comic books is mostly based on old novels, simplifying them, popularizing them, and making them interesting, with half the content being text and half being illustrations. Occasionally, news events that occur in society are compiled into comics. Most of the content is supernatural and legendary, such as "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes," "Wild River Heroine," and "Burning the Red Lotus Temple." There are many titles, but obscene works are relatively rare. Since the target audience is children and adults with rudimentary literacy, chivalrous novels are more attractive.</p>
<p>Industry Overview There are no less than a hundred bookstores in the city that publish comic books, and most of them are located in the Beigongyi Lane of Mongolia Road in Zhabei. There are as many as eighty or ninety stores there. There are also several stores in Nine Acres. Only one store is on Dalu Road. The total number of published types is eight or nine hundred, each ranging from one to more than ten volumes. Wholesale sales to other cities are very prosperous, especially to the north. Those who sell in the city are all book vendors in various neighborhoods, used to roughly provide nearby residents with reading material. The lowest price averages from seven cents to one jiao per volume.</p>
<p>Significant Impact Although comic books are not noticed by the general intellectual class, they have a great influence among the lower class and children. Because they are popular, simple, and interesting, they are almost everywhere. Students in shops and factories are particularly fond of renting these readings. However, because of the supernatural and legendary content, children's thinking is changed by it, which is no less effective than supernatural films. It is indeed the most popular reading material among the public.</p>
<p>Finding Ways to Improve Educational circles consider comic books to be a useful tool for promoting social education. Therefore, there have been several attempts to improve them in recent years, such as the Shanghai Social Education Society and the Children's Bookstore, which have published improved comic books. It is recently heard that the Ministry of Education is also paying close attention to this and is planning to revise them.</p>

<p>Ms. Wu Yifang, President of Jinling Women's University in Nanjing, went to the central government for a meeting in early May this year and inspected university education in various countries in Western Europe. In mid-September, she traveled from Europe to the United States to attend the grand celebration of Harvard University's 300th anniversary. After the meeting, she contacted the school's founding committee to discuss everything and visited various universities to learn from them. She has completed her work and started her journey back home. She arrived in Shanghai yesterday (3rd) and will attend gatherings today and tomorrow. She will return to school the day after tomorrow. The school's faculty and staff sent representatives to Shanghai to welcome her. The four Yan sisters inherited their father Zi Jun's will and donated a large sum of money to build a sanatorium. Since construction began this spring, it has taken seven or eight months, and all projects have been completed. With the assistance of Yan's sons-in-law, Wu Taomin, Xu Zhendong, and other four gentlemen, they donated various equipment. Now that the layout is ready, the dedication ceremony is scheduled to be held on the 7th of this month. Shen Kefei, the acting director of the Central Hospital, and others will give speeches. In addition, the school was founded in the fourth year of the Republic of China and has been 21 years old.

<h3 id="e104">Tao Baichuan's Speech: How to Revive Chinese Culture - At the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Cultural Association recently held a social gathering, and specially invited Mr. Tao Baichuan, who had just returned from a study tour in Europe and America, to give a speech on "How to Revive Chinese Culture." A record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Study of Foreign Cultures Reveals Two Points Worth Noting</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Sino-Foreign Cultural Association, I had already participated in the Cultural Construction Association. At that time, ten professors advocated native culture. What exactly is China's native culture? Although its essence and definition were not clearly defined, it aroused considerable attention in all circles for a time. Later, I went abroad to study foreign cultures and found two points worth noting: (1) Pay attention to the people's lives; (2) Establish a solid economic foundation. All countries pay close attention to the people's lives, especially in the Soviet Union, where this is particularly evident. They pay special attention to the lives of children, women, and the working masses. Nurseries and kindergartens can be seen everywhere. The national character of the German people tends towards militarism and iron-bloodedness. Only with such a nation can there be such a Germany. Therefore, how should we start to promote the revival of Chinese culture? I believe that in addition to politics and economics, we must explore and seek conclusions in the area of people's lives. Because politics, economics, and the people's basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, and transportation are all elements that constitute culture. Are the physique and spirit of the Chinese people adapted to the modern world? Under the impact of the two forces of the left and right, can our nation stand its ground? Can we save the country from the brink of collapse? Can the whole country still strive to improve our lives?</p>
<p>To Promote Culture, One Must First Study People's Lives</p>
<p>The object of the people's lives should be all systems, cultural relics, institutions, and customs. Culture can certainly influence people's lives, but ultimately culture is created by people. Therefore, to promote culture, one must first study people's lives. My feeling after studying various countries is that we should: (1) Promote the people's health. We cannot discover our own shortcomings without comparing ourselves with others. The results of this World Games and the struggles that occurred show that the Chinese people cannot survive unless they start with health. Taking football as an example, the failure of our players is due to their lack of physical endurance. Therefore, we must strive for physical health in life, in addition to politics and economics, in order to find a way out. If the Chinese people do not improve their health, they will perish without being invaded by others. (2) Cultivate the people's spirit of struggle. In the World Games, our football team failed due to lack of physical strength, while our basketball team failed due to lack of unwavering fighting spirit. When the draw resulted in playing Japan first, the players' spirits were immediately dampened, and the result was failure. Our basketball team had previously performed very well in competitions with American basketball teams. This time, psychological failure led to factual failure. After returning to China, I had the same feeling when I saw the diplomatic situation. I have talked with Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, and others in the National Salvation Association. They believe that the purpose of the National Salvation Association is to promote resistance against Japan, but there is still a problem that the government is not ready yet, so it cannot promote resistance against Japan. But we must cultivate the spirit of resistance against Japan. The reason why the Jewish people cannot restore their country is that the nation lacks the spirit of struggle. German youths all wear uniforms, and everyone carries a knife and hangs portraits of famous people, both literary and military, everywhere. They also wear swords. The Soviet Union also pays great attention to cultivating the spirit of struggle in children's training. Everything is man-made. The country is built by people. Therefore, the culture of a country is the life of the people.</p>
<p>To Promote a Country's Culture, Attention Should Be Paid to the Economy</p>
<p>The first point we should pay attention to is the economy, which is the foundation of everything. Politics and education are the upper levels, while the economy is the lower foundation. To change or promote a country's culture, one must rely on the economy. The Soviet Union is indeed a new society. Regardless of whether you oppose it or support it, you cannot deny that they have new constructions. They have kitchen factories specializing in cooking. They want women to run from the kitchen to the factory. Farms must first relieve them of their kitchen work at home. After women finish their work, they can go to the kitchen factory to buy cooked food. Soviet families now have no kitchens. Women have four months of leave during childbirth, and light industry also has three days of leave. When a child is two months old, he or she can be sent to a nursery. Nurseries accept children of several levels: two months old or older, five months old or older, one year old or older, and two years old or older. At the age of three, they go to kindergarten. Women are liberated from the family, so they can contribute their labor to society. If China wants to revive the nation and promote culture, it cannot achieve its goal without improving the people's lives and the national economy. As the people's lives are gradually improved and the national economy is gradually built, culture will be within it. We do not have to learn from other countries' left-leaning tendencies, nor do we have to imitate other countries' right-leaning tendencies. Although the Kuomintang has periods of military administration and tutelage, it must move towards constitutionalism.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School Overview (III) Special Report by This Newspaper: Hu Zuyin's Investigation <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The service regulations for faculty and staff of each school, as well as the detailed rules for the service of principals, academic directors, teachers, and clerks, have been stipulated and will not be repeated here. The daily work of faculty and staff at school has also been specified in detail. The work is divided into three categories: work at the beginning of the semester, work after the start of school, and work after school. The work after the start of school is further divided into four types: daily work, weekly work, monthly work, and every six weeks of work. All faculty and staff of each school are full-time employees and may not hold any paid positions outside the school. Faculty and staff must abide by the service creed and all regular rules.</p>
<p>In addition to performing their own teaching duties, faculty and staff must participate in various relevant meetings in the school. The school's meetings include the school affairs meeting and the teaching affairs meeting, which discuss all issues related to school affairs and teaching affairs. There are also high-grade, middle-grade, low-grade, and kindergarten education research meetings to discuss teaching matters related to each grade. There are also guidance committees, admissions committees, graduate guidance committees, and Boy Scout affairs committees, etc., to discuss and handle matters within the scope of each committee.</p>
<p>5. Qualifications and Treatment of Faculty and Staff</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School Faculty and Staff Employment and Treatment Regulations, principals must have a degree from a domestic or foreign university's education department, education college, education department, or normal university, and have served in the education field for more than three years, and have considerable writings or achievements. The qualifications of the academic director are the same as those of the principal, and they enjoy the treatment of first-class teachers. Second-class teachers must have a degree from a domestic university and be engaged in full-time teaching. Third-class teachers must be graduates of normal colleges and secondary normal schools or secondary specialized schools and be engaged in specialized teaching. Clerks are divided into two grades: second grade and third grade. They must be graduates of secondary schools or have equivalent academic qualifications, be able to calculate school accounts, and be able to handle Chinese and English documents. The number of faculty and staff in Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School is now copied and recorded according to grade as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School Faculty and Staff Number Survey Table (Surveyed in July 1936)</p>
<p>In terms of treatment, the salary of formally employed faculty and staff is based on individual qualifications and the position held, as specified below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School Faculty and Staff Salary Standard Table (in yuan)</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are responsible for their own board and lodging. However, if there are suitable houses in the school and they voluntarily live in them, the accommodation fee may be deducted from their monthly salary according to the following standards.</p>
<p>Other benefits include seniority bonuses, vacation salaries, medical subsidies, and retirement savings. Faculty and staff who have been employed for more than one year will receive an additional half-month's salary as a seniority bonus every New Year's Day; however, the seniority bonus for those with a monthly salary of more than 200 yuan is limited to 100 yuan. In addition, faculty and staff who have been employed for more than one year and resign with the approval of the Municipal Council may receive one month's vacation salary; those who resign before being employed for one year will have their salary calculated up to the date of termination of their position or teaching duties. Faculty and staff who are hospitalized for illness in the Municipal Council Hospital or a hospital designated by the Municipal Council will be subsidized by the Municipal Council for medical expenses of $1.25 per day. Female staff members or female teachers who are pregnant and give birth may apply for a long leave of one semester (seven months). No salary will be paid during the leave. After returning to work after the leave, in addition to not counting the leave period, their length of service will still be calculated as continuous employment.</p>
<p>Retirement savings are made by each school's faculty and staff by deducting 5% of their monthly salary, which is stored by the Municipal Council as retirement savings. The Municipal Council adds twice the amount of the retirement savings deducted by each employee each month, merges and stores them, and also provides a fixed annual interest rate of 6% on the savings. Depositors who meet one of the following conditions may recover all of the retirement savings and interest paid by the Municipal Council; otherwise, depositors may only recover their own retirement savings and interest:</p>
<p>1. Those who have joined the savings plan for more than three years and apply for resignation with the approval of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>2. Those who are disabled due to illness or injury in the line of duty, and are certified by the Municipal Council's doctor as unable to continue working.</p>
<p>3. Those who have been continuously employed for 20 years and apply for resignation with the approval of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>In addition to the above benefits, there are also funeral expenses, death benefits, disability benefits, and retirement pensions. If a faculty or staff member of each school dies in the line of duty, their successor or legal representative may receive funeral expenses of 60 yuan from the Municipal Council; they may also receive from the Municipal Council an amount equal to 5% of the employee's annual salary at the time of death multiplied by the number of years of service as death benefits. If they are disabled due to illness in the line of duty, and are certified by the Municipal Council's doctor as unable to continue working, and are guaranteed by the head of the department as having always been cautious in their work, they may receive from the Municipal Council an amount equal to 5% of the annual salary at the time of retirement multiplied by the number of years of service as disability benefits. Those who have been employed for 20 years and have been approved to resign by the Municipal Council may receive from the Municipal Council an amount equal to 5% of the annual salary at the time of retirement multiplied by the number of years of service as retirement pensions.</p>
<p>6. Teacher Training Methods</p>
<p>In addition to teaching, teachers at Municipal Council Primary Schools must participate in various training activities. Each school has a teacher library, and various books, newspapers, and magazines that teachers should read are added every year. The Chinese Education Department compiles and prints an index of educational books and papers every month and distributes it to teachers in each school for reference. After reading the books, teachers must also make a written report and submit it to the Chinese Education Department for review. During the winter and summer vacations, teachers in each school have assigned vacation work, such as collecting teaching materials for each subject, compiling teaching units, and reading various books and newspapers.</p>
<p>Every Saturday afternoon, teachers of each subject in each school jointly hold subject-based research meetings to participate in research together. Several lectures are held during each semester, and celebrities are hired by the Chinese Education Department to give lectures, and teachers from each school must attend. Each school also has off-campus visits, and teachers take turns to participate, visiting famous schools in and outside the city, large-scale organizations and factories, and various exhibitions. After the teachers visit, they make written reports separately, compile teaching materials, or collect teaching aids as a reference for improving teaching.</p>
<p>Teachers in each school also pay attention to their own health. After school every afternoon, male and female teachers often participate in various extracurricular activities in groups. Each school currently has teacher tennis teams, basketball teams, football teams, table tennis teams, volleyball teams, and quoits teams. The Chinese Education Department often holds various teacher sports competitions during each semester, in which teachers from each school participate separately, competing fairly and winning, in order to improve health and promote emotional connections.</p>
<p>Correction: In the Shanghai Municipal Council Primary School Overview (II) published yesterday, paragraph four should be paragraph two, and paragraph two should be the last paragraph of the article. Also, "School Buildings and Equipment" should be changed to Section 3.</p>

<p>Chairman Lin then went to the Sino-Western Sanitarium on Rue Pu Shi at 9:40 AM to have his body examined. He was personally examined by the national physician Lu Zhong'an. It was not until 11:10 AM that the examination was completed, and he returned to his residence for lunch. According to Lu Zhong'an, Chairman Lin's health is good, and he only felt slightly tired. He has already prepared a conditioning formula to help him recover.</p>
<p>Visiting Friends</p>
<p>After returning to his residence for lunch at noon, Chairman Lin took the medicine prescribed by Lu Zhong'an and took a nap. In the afternoon, he got up and went out to visit friends until about 5:30 PM, when he returned to his residence to rest.</p>
<p>Chairman's Remarks</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Chairman Lin yesterday evening and was received by him. Although the Chairman is old, he is still in good spirits. According to Chairman Lin, he has been away from Shanghai for ten months, and he has been taking the medicine prescribed by Dr. Lu Zhong'an for ten months. Recently, as the weather has gradually turned cold, the elderly inevitably feel some changes, so he made a special trip to Shanghai to have Dr. Lu Zhong'an examine his body and prescribe a new formula for him to continue taking. After taking the medicine just now, he felt quite comfortable. The reporter then asked him about his views on the overall situation. The Chairman did not want to express much on this, but said that protecting the family can protect the country, and protecting the country can protect the family. The two are inseparable. The traditional concept of the Chinese people is to value the family and despise the country, but they do not know that without a country, how can there be a family? This traditional concept is actually wrong, but this traditional concept has changed in recent years. During President Chiang's birthday, the people of the whole country enthusiastically contributed to the purchase of airplanes to dedicate to the country, which is enough to prove. He (Chairman Lin) is deeply gratified by this.</p>

He Met with Kong Xiangxi the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinxin News Agency, Li Sihao, a member of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Commission and Chairman of the Economic Committee, said last night that he had originally planned to go to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee, but now that Duan Zhilao has suddenly passed away, he must stay in Shanghai to assist in handling the funeral. He has postponed his departure for a few days and will be able to leave on the 8th or 9th. He (Li Sihao) visited Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, the day before yesterday, but Kong was still ill and did not have much to say. He only briefly discussed the principles that need to be discussed. The details still need to be discussed calmly.</p>
<h3 id="e113">National Economic Construction Commission to Establish National Goods Companies Universally. The First Step is to Establish 40 Locations. <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Under the advocacy of Chairman Chiang, the National Economic Construction Commission is proceeding very actively. The General Assembly is located in the capital, and ministers of various ministries and leaders from industrial, commercial, and financial circles serve as members to preside over the affairs of the commission. In various provinces and cities, local administrative officials, together with local industrial, commercial, and financial circles, have organized many branches. The General Assembly has formulated specific plans for the implementation of construction projects. The most urgent task is the promotion of national goods. Recently, Cheng Juemin, Deputy Director of the Executive Division, was specially sent to Shanghai to make contact. He visited Wang Xingyao, the director of the China National Goods Introduction Center and the Joint Office of National Goods Companies, and discussed the matter. He completed his work the day before yesterday and returned to Nanjing to report. He also planned everything. It is learned that as a result of the efforts of the National Goods Joint Office in the past two years, more than ten National Goods Companies have been established, covering various provinces, and have a considerable foundation, but they still need to work hard to promote them. Now, the National Economic Construction Commission plans to establish 40 companies in various provinces and major commercial ports as the first step. The Joint Office will send personnel to negotiate and proceed with the commission, and the commission will be responsible for the organization. The Joint Office will contact various national goods factories to participate. The capital for each location is 80,000 to 100,000 yuan. After preparations are completed, they will be established one by one. The ultimate goal is to establish a National Goods Company in every county.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Opportunities for Chinese Goods in the Nanyang Market. Dutch Reduce Tariffs, Dutch Ships Appropriately Reduce Freight Rates <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Java, Surabaya, Semarang, and other ports in the Dutch East Indies have always been major producers of sugar, and the daily necessities of their native people must be supplied by other countries. Chinese goods such as cement and wheat flour are shipped to Java in large quantities. However, in the gradual promotion of this business, the value of the Dutch currency suddenly fell, causing a major blow to Chinese goods arriving in Nanyang. The value of one Chinese dollar has always been 43 Dutch cents, but now it can be exchanged for 54 Dutch cents. As a result, the selling price of Chinese goods shipped to Nanyang has invisibly increased by 25%. This not only affects the livelihood of the local natives, but also hinders Chinese commercial goods. The Dutch government has organized a special committee to discuss how to remedy the lives of the people, suppress prices, and prevent the decline in currency value from hindering the import of daily necessities. After deliberation, it was decided to reduce import tariffs, and it was resolved to implement this from the 1st of this month. The tax reduction methods are divided into two categories: one is to shorten the import surtax, and the other is to reduce the import tax. Generally, it is reduced by about 20%. For goods assessed for import, the surtax was originally 50%, but it has now been changed to 25%. Cotton yarn with no printing of 45 pieces will also be specially reduced by 20%. As for the import tax, it must be reduced by about half. For example, the import of flour, which was originally taxed at 12%, is now taxed at only 6%. Shirts, etc., which were originally taxed at 12%, are now changed to 6%. Foreign yarn, which was originally taxed at 10%, is now reduced to 6%. Shanghai homespun cloth, which was originally taxed at 12%, is now also changed to 6%. Blankets, etc., are also changed to 6%. The import tariff is reduced to suppress the selling price, so that Chinese goods shipped to Nanyang can pay less import tax and not be affected by the decline in the guilder price. This new tariff has been sent to Shanghai to notify all industries. It has been found that the Nanyang liners of Chinese shipping companies should also announce a reduction in prices at the same time. The first class fare from Shanghai to Hong Kong is 100 yuan, the second class fare is reduced from 50 yuan to 45 yuan, the third class fare is reduced from 30 yuan to 27.5 yuan, and the steerage fare is reduced from 17.5 yuan to 15 yuan. The first class fare to Xiamen is 75 yuan, the second class fare is reduced from 50 yuan to 45 yuan, the third class fare is reduced from 30 yuan to 27 yuan, and the steerage fare is 12.5 yuan.</p>

<p>In order to relieve the fishing industry, the Ministry of Industry has specially joined forces with the Shanghai financial community to establish a Fishery Bank Group. All organizational regulations, etc., have been approved by the Executive Yuan. However, due to preparations for the Rural Bank, the establishment was delayed. However, in response to the needs of fishermen, the China, New China, and Four Lines Savings Banks have each allocated 40,000 yuan in funds, totaling 120,000 yuan, to lend to fishermen. It is learned that the Ministry of Industry believes that the bank group is one of the most effective ways to relieve the fishing industry and should not be delayed any further. Therefore, it specially sent letters to Qian Xinzhi of the Shanghai Four Lines Savings Bank, Qian Yanfang of the China Bank, Wang Zhihua of the New China Bank, etc., urging them to contact various participating banks and raise and pay the funds pledged, totaling 250,000 yuan, as soon as possible, so that the bank group can be established as soon as possible. Qian Xinzhi, Wang Zhihua, Xu Xinliu, and others went to Beijing the day before yesterday to attend the second board meeting of the Rural Bank, and will take the opportunity to discuss the implementation methods with Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry. After returning to Shanghai, they will convene a meeting of representatives of various participating banks, and then formally establish the bank group on a scheduled date. Before the formal establishment of the Fishery Bank Group, the 120,000 yuan of fishery loans from the China, New China, and Four Lines Savings Banks will continue to be lent. Since the start of lending, more than 50,000 yuan has been lent, mostly to the Ningbo Fishery Loan Cooperative. The loan procedures require the fisherman to apply to the three banks through the fish market wholesaler, and the fish market will provide a guarantee. After passing the review, the loan can be borrowed, with a maximum term of ten months and an interest rate of 9%, but it can be repaid in installments.</p>

On the 6th, a clear list would be compiled, the funds remitted to the Aviation Association, and a list of donor households, as well as the names of non-donating households, would be published in advertisements for public recognition.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Local Association telegraphed the authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces on the 31st of last month, requesting the revocation of the clear order banning rice from leaving the province. It is now learned that Zhejiang Province has replied by telegram, stating: (Excerpt) "Your telegram is acknowledged. This province's restriction on rice leaving the province is purely to prevent smuggling to the sea and is by no means intended to impede domestic circulation. If Shanghai has appropriate measures to prevent export, and this province indeed has surplus rice, it will naturally be transported to aid Shanghai, but it must be formally certified by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to prevent smuggling." (End excerpt). The association has also sent letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Grain Association for their information.</p>
<h3 id="e118">German Ambassador Dr. Trautmann Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Evening Denies German-Japanese Alliance Resolves Not to Recognize Manchukuo <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, German Ambassador to China, Dr. Trautmann, returned to his post via the United States. He and his wife arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM aboard the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada, which docked at the Qichang Warehouse Pier in Pudong (originally scheduled to dock at the Gonghexiang Pier).</p>
<p>Welcoming Personnel</p>
<p>German Consul General in Shanghai, Kriebel, and German Embassy Secretary Mohr and Commercial Counselor Weidfa, who came specifically from Nanjing, as well as Consul Kauder, German News Agency President Ge Linfu, and others, went to the ship to welcome him. Ambassador Trautmann then transferred to the company's reception launch and disembarked at the Customs Pier at 4:00 PM. Deputy Director Zhou Jue and Secretary Zhang Meng of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office also made a temporary visit to the pier to welcome him.</p>
<p>Departing for Nanjing that Evening</p>
<p>After disembarking, Ambassador Trautmann went directly to the German Legation on Huangpu Road to rest. In the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by German Consul General Kriebel and then, together with his wife and Embassy Secretary Mohr who had come from Nanjing, departed for Nanjing on the 11:00 PM night express train to meet Foreign Minister Zhang and report on his return to his post. Because the German Embassy had already moved from Beiping to Nanjing, he would remain stationed in Nanjing from then on and would not need to go to Beiping.</p>
<p>Talks During Stopover in Shanghai</p>
<p>Ambassador Trautmann met with a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter on the ship yesterday and made the following remarks: Ambassador Trautmann first stated that he had returned to Germany for a six-month leave, during which he met with German officials in Berlin and Hamburg, as well as individuals enthusiastic about Sino-German culture in the Far East Association. He noted that the German people were extremely excited about the participation of the Chinese delegation in the World Games held in Germany, but he expressed regret for any shortcomings in their hospitality. He mentioned that the art pieces he had collected and brought back from China were displayed and exhibited, and were warmly received by the German people, who praised them highly. He also pointed out that there were many Chinese students in Germany, which was a testament to the cultural ties between the two countries, and that Sino-German cultural relations had seen progress in recent years, which he would continue to strive for. He expressed his joy at being able to return to learn more about Chinese culture.</p>
<p>German-Russian Relations</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired about the German-Russian issue, noting that the two countries had been attacking each other, and the situation seemed very tense. Ambassador Trautmann stated that the various rumors about Germany and Russia were not to be believed. However, he said that Germany was an enemy of communism, opposed communism, and opposed Bolshevism, and that there were no other political issues between Germany and Russia.</p>
<p>German-Japanese Relations</p>
<p>He continued, stating that he had transited Japan during his trip but did not stop there, instead proceeding directly to China on the same ship, and therefore had not met with any Japanese officials. At this point, the reporter inquired about the relationship between Germany and Japan. Ambassador Trautmann stated that Germany wished to be friendly with Japan, just as it did with China, but that, standing in the position of Ambassador to China, he hoped for a particularly friendly relationship between China and Germany. Ambassador Trautmann also denied previous reports of a German-Japanese military alliance, stating that he had heard nothing of it.</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Disputes</p>
<p>Ambassador Trautmann continued to answer questions from the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, stating that he had only seen reports in the newspapers regarding the situation between China and Japan, and that negotiations were currently underway in Nanjing. He said that he had been away from his post for a long time and was not familiar with the current situation, so he was not in a position to comment. However, he said that he hoped that China and Japan could reach a mutual understanding and peacefully resolve everything.</p>
<p>Non-Recognition of Manchukuo</p>
<p>It was reported earlier that the Havas News Agency had reported that Germany was disappointed with the soybean agreement previously signed with the puppet "Manchukuo" because imports from Manchukuo to Germany had increased sharply while German exports to the puppet state had decreased. The reporter specifically raised this question with Ambassador Trautmann. Ambassador Trautmann declined to comment on this, but later stated that Germany would never recognize the puppet "Manchukuo," and that Germany's attitude remained the same and would not change. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter finally inquired about Germany's return to the League of Nations. Ambassador Trautmann smiled and did not answer, and the interview concluded happily.</p>

<p>Following the death of Duan Qirui, former head of the Beijing government, the Duan residence's funeral arrangement committee was established yesterday, and Duan's will was released last night. Chairman Lin, Mayor Wu, and others visited to pay their respects yesterday, and over a hundred telegrams of condolence have been received from various locations outside the city. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Lin and Others Personally Pay Condolences</p>
<p>Those who visited to pay their respects yesterday morning and afternoon included Chairman Lin of the National Government, Mayor Wu of this city, Police Chief Cai Jinjun, Yu Qiaqing, Gong Xinzhan, Huang Fu (represented by Xu Xiuzhi), Central Committee member Chu Minyi, Foreign Minister Zhang Qun's representative, Director Zhou Jue of the Shanghai Office, Feng Gengguang, Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Liu Chaowang, Han Yunbo, Li Guojie, Gong Zhenpeng, Zhu Hongzhi, Zhao Hengti, Xu Xiuzhi, Chief Judge Lu Yimei of the Local Court, Qian Xinzhi, Qu Wenliu, National Government Relief Committee Chairman Zhu Qinglan, Japanese national Funatsu, and over two hundred of Duan's former colleagues and friends.</p>
<p>Solemn and Respectful Funeral Hall Arrangement</p>
<p>The funeral hall was set up in the main hall of the residence. The remains were covered with silk curtains, and an altar with fruit, vegetable offerings, incense, and candles was placed in front. Below, various wreaths were arranged, including dozens from Chairman Lin, Mayor Wu, Commander Yang, Finance Minister Kong, Foreign Minister Zhang, Governor Zhang Jia'ao of the Bank of China, and Financial Decision-maker Xu Kan. Because Duan was a devout Buddhist in life, the funeral hall arrangement followed Buddhist rituals, which was quite solemn and respectful. In front of the hall, there was a Buddhist monk, and in a separate room, there were many Buddhist followers chanting scriptures. Visitors were led in by ushers and performed the customary rites.</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangement Committee Established Yesterday</p>
<p>The Duan residence, led by Duan's former colleagues Li Sihao, Wu Guangxin, Zeng Yunpei, Liang Zhongyi, Qu Wenliu, and over thirty others, organized the funeral arrangement committee at the Duan residence on Avenue Joffre. It was established yesterday and divided into three groups: document, administration, and reception, to manage all affairs.</p>
<p>Funeral Announcement Issued, Burial Tomorrow</p>
<p>Duan's remains are scheduled to be buried tomorrow at 2:00 PM. The funeral arrangement committee has issued the following funeral announcement: "The former Head of the Republic of China, Duan, passed away on November 2nd at 7-9 PM. The burial is scheduled for 2:00 PM on the 5th at this residence. Duan Residence Funeral Arrangement Committee, 1487 Avenue Joffre."</p>
<p>Eight Admonitions in the Will Regarding National Affairs</p>
<p>The original text of Duan's will is as follows: "Will of the Old Man Zhengdao. I am over seventy years old. In the event of my sudden demise, considering the principle of life's journey and death's return, I have no lingering concerns. However, looking around, the country is vast, the people are poor, and resources are exhausted, which is truly heartbreaking. I have never liked to talk much. In the past, the country may not fully remember my advice on moving firewood and preventing chimney fires. Now, based on the experience of a seasoned traveler, I offer a final warning, hoping that the people of the country will listen quietly and act diligently. Then, even if I die, I will live on, and my eyes will be closed in peace. Although the country is weak, there is hope for revival. The way to revival is also very simple: Do not lightly initiate political disputes based on personal opinions, do not engage in empty talk without considering practice, do not undertake unnecessary tasks and waste public funds, do not believe in extreme theories and shake the foundation of the country. Those who discuss diplomacy should not forget to strengthen national defense. Those who manage education should not forget to preserve the national essence. Those who manage families should not abandon the inherent etiquette. Those who seek knowledge should not be distracted by the superficial brilliance of fashion. Adhering to these eight admonitions will cope with all situations. The so-called self-reliance lies in this, and turning weakness into strength also lies in this. I have never engaged in production in my life. My descendants should understand my intention of enjoying the Tao and being content with poverty. Funerals should be thrifty. Dress me in a Buddhist robe and do not offer meat or fish as sacrifices. This will was written on the fifth day after the Mid-Autumn Festival of the Bingzi year at Zhengdao Residence on Avenue Joffre."</p>

<p>Engineer Lei Binglin of Wing On Spinning Mill has been researching for many years and has recently made two major inventions on spinning machines: one is a double trumpet on the roving frame, and the other is a large drafting on the spinning frame. These two inventions have been practically tested at the Ansha factory, and the results are very good. Yesterday, the Cotton Textile Dyeing Experiment Hall of the Academia Sinica specially sent four textile experts, Chuandao Shen, Ren Shangwu, Li Zhuangshou, and Nie Guangyu, to visit. They said that these inventions could not only improve product quality and increase production but also reduce manufacturing costs, which is truly good news for the future of Chinese textiles. However, they were unwilling to disclose the detailed content because the inventions had just been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for patent application and had not yet been approved. According to reports, Lei studied textile engineering in the United States and served as a professor of textile engineering at Nantong University for 15 years and as an engineer at Wing On Spinning Mill for more than 10 years. He is currently about 60 years old, with a full head of white hair, but he is in very good spirits.</p>

<p>Since the era of Chen Jitang's governance in Guangdong Province, most industries and businesses have been subject to unified control and monopoly for the purpose of collecting money. The tobacco monopoly is recognized as harmful to merchants and detrimental to farmers. After the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, the Guangdong Tobacco Leaf and Tobacco Thread Associations and farmers from various regions have called for the abolition of the tobacco monopoly. However, the government has not adopted their requests. The tobacco merchants and farmers are greatly disappointed. They have held separate meetings to decide to send representatives to Nanjing to petition for the abolition of the tobacco monopoly. Representatives from the Tobacco Thread Association, Fang Yuwan, the Tobacco Leaf Association, Wu Yuqiang, Su Dingchuan, and the Heshan farmers representatives, Lu Yining, Chen Yiguang, and five others, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday aboard the Coolidge. In addition to appealing to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Guangdong Compatriots Association, and related organizations in this city for assistance, urging the government to abolish this harsh policy, they also plan to host the local press to explain the harms of the monopoly, with the aim of gaining unanimous support from the public opinion.</p>

<p>The Public Society reports that workers from six silk weaving factories in Shanghai's West District on Avenue President Pershing, namely Baohua, Tiancheng, Fuxing, Yucun Yongfeng, Yiyou, and others, previously initiated the establishment of the Third District Silk Weaving Industry Union.  However, Tiancheng and Baohua factories dismissed eleven union organizers, including Lü Shaocheng and Xu Housheng, leading to worker dissatisfaction. Representatives were elected to demand the reinstatement of the dismissed workers from the managers of the two factories. This led to conflicts with guards and staff at the Yucun factory, resulting in a labor strike. Subsequently, over sixty worker representatives presented six demands and petitioned party and government authorities.  The Municipal Party Committee, after receiving the petition, feared the expansion of the labor unrest.  It promptly collaborated with Zhang Chuqiang, a representative from the Social Affairs Bureau, to earnestly persuade both labor and management in each factory to resume work first, and await mediation according to the law for all disputes. Yesterday morning, around 7 a.m., the workers of these factories demanded the payment of back wages from the factory management, but without result.  Therefore, around 10 a.m., they resumed the strike. Upon receiving the report, the party and government authorities believed that the repeated occurrences of labor unrest in these six factories were significantly related to social tranquility. In addition to instructing the workers to await handling, they also decided to formally convene both parties on the 5th of this month (Thursday) for mediation according to the law, in order to prevent the prolongation of the labor unrest.</p>

<p>The Special Seamen's Branch of the Kuomintang, in order to manage seamen affairs, previously drafted a plan for reorganizing Chinese seamen, requesting the Central Government to order its implementation. The Central Government ordered the Ministry of Communications to review and implement it, but it has not yet been promulgated. Therefore, the party branch has specifically reapplied to the Ministry of Communications for the original plan: (1) Only those seamen who hold a membership certificate from the Chinese Seamen's Union shall be recognized as seamen. (2) Non-seamen shall not be permitted to serve as seamen workers on vessels powered by machinery. (3) When seamen obtain certificates, the local seamen's branches must employ experts with seafaring skills to conduct face-to-face examinations. Only those who pass the examination can be reported to the headquarters for issuance. (4) The examination of seamen shall be conducted through oral tests and practical operations. (5) When companies and shipping bureaus employ seamen, they must consult with the Seamen's Union. The union shall be responsible to the employer. If dismissals or replacements are necessary, they should also be handled in consultation with the union. If employers and the union have any disputes, they may be jointly decided by party and government authorities.</p>

<p>Ye Jiaxing, a prominent figure from Cixi residing in Shanghai, has held numerous important military and political positions. Recently, he has served as a member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, a member of the Municipal Federation, and a member of the Taxpayers Association. In recent years, he has served the community, and he has been enthusiastic and diligent in all local public welfare matters. Therefore, he has gained considerable trust from all sectors. This year, on November 5, is the 70th birthday of Ye's mother, Madam Xu. Considering the plight of the people and the difficulties of the nation, Madam Ye does not wish to have any celebratory or extravagant events. However, those who have a friendship with Ye Jiaxing, such as Zhang Xueliang, Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, Liu Zhi, Huang Shaoxiong, Liu Zhenhua, Jiang Dingwen, Zhang Qun, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Lifu, Chu Minyi, Wu Tiecheng, Cai Jinjun, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Yang Hu, Chu Hede, Wang Yansong, Lu Liankui, Jin Tingsun, Fang Jiaobo, Ye Zhuotang, and Chen Bulei, in order to commend Madam Ye's virtue and conduct, have jointly initiated a celebration to wish her longevity. Because Mr. Ye has a wide circle of friends, it is heard that recently, important party and state figures, such as Chairman Lin Sen of the National Government, personally bestowed a plaque with the four characters "Qing Du Wei," and Vice Chairman Yan Xishan of the Military Affairs Commission personally inscribed the four characters "Mu Yi Zu Shi." The President of the Legislative Yuan, Sun Ke, the President of the Control Yuan, Yu Youren, Kong Xiangxi, Han Fuqu, Song Ziwen, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Jie, Qian Yongming, Yang Xiaotian, Jiang Zuobin, Xu Peihuang, Chuan Zongyao, Tang Min, and Xu Jilü have all sent valuable gifts.

<p>Tan Haiyun, a young woman from Guangdong, 25 years old, married Pan Awan five years ago, who used to work in the Xiaoshadu Mint. Because her husband smokes opium and does not manage the household, she hired a lawyer to file for divorce with the Local Court, stating in brief: The plaintiff and the defendant have been married for five years, and the couple has not been harmonious since they married. Moreover, the defendant has an addiction, smoking opium, so his monthly wage of more than ten yuan is used entirely for himself. Persuasion is met with beatings, and the plaintiff is regarded as a thorn in his side, leading to abandonment and neglect of life. This situation constitutes the provisions of Article 1052, Item 5 of the Civil Code, requesting a divorce, etc. Yesterday morning, the court opened the hearing. The defendant did not appear, but the plaintiff arrived in court and stated what had happened. The inquiring official said, "The defendant has no confirmed address, and there is a jurisdictional issue. You are hereby given three days to ascertain the address, and he will be summoned for verification."</p>

<p>Mr. Zhang Yuanshan, Director-General of the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Association at 505 Henan Road, has been in charge of the association's affairs for fifteen years with outstanding results. Recently, because he also serves as Director of the Cooperative Affairs Department of the Ministry of Industry, he finds it difficult to manage both. He has repeatedly resigned from the association in order to focus on the Ministry's affairs. The Executive Committee has approved this and requested Executive Committee member Mr. Baker to succeed him. However, Mr. Zhang will leave his post on the 1st of this month, and Mr. Baker will not return to China to take over until January next year. The Executive Committee of the Association believes that the position of Director-General is a major responsibility and should not be left vacant. Furthermore, the 15th Anniversary Celebration is scheduled to be held on the 16th of this month, and the various preparations beforehand are extremely complex and require someone to preside over them. Therefore, it was resolved that before Mr. Baker takes office, the duties of the Director-General will be temporarily handled by Mr. Adous, the Vice President of the Association. In addition, the Beijing office has just been established, and its work is complicated and requires a capable person to preside over everything. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Yuanshan is requested to serve as Honorary Director and direct operations from nearby.</p>

<p>Before and after dawn yesterday in this city, there was another abundant rainfall, which lasted for a long time. This will undoubtedly greatly benefit agricultural crops. We now record the details as follows:</p>
<p>Abundant Rainfall</p>
<p>In this city, after a small amount of rain fell on the night of September 15, it became sunny and dry from then on, until it rained again on the 1st of this month. However, the amount of rainfall was minimal, and the weather turned sunny again on the 2nd. The fields were eagerly awaiting rain, but this was not enough. Before and after dawn yesterday, there was a sudden downpour, which lasted for a long time, stopping around 8 a.m.</p>
<p>Darkness After the Rain</p>
<p>After the rain, the sky was as dark as ink, and it seemed like dusk was approaching. It was difficult to distinguish people even a few steps away. Vehicles on the streets all drove slowly with their lights on. Shops had to turn on their electric lights to do business. This darkness lasted for about half an hour before the sky began to clear slightly. However, the clouds were still swirling and seemed to indicate more rain. The weather cleared up in the afternoon, and a pleasant rainfall continued late into the night.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of autumn, there has been a lack of rain, and the water level of the Yangtze River has continued to fall, making navigation difficult. According to a report from the Customs Surveyor's Office yesterday morning, the water levels at Anqing, Wuhu, and other places continued to fall. Vessels traveling to and from the area can barely navigate the center of the waterway and must reduce their tonnage. The details are as follows, recorded by a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao:</p>
<p>River Water Falls Again</p>
<p>According to a report from the Jianghai Customs Surveyor's Office yesterday morning, the water level of the Yangtze River upstream continued to fall in the past two days: (2nd) Anqing 10 feet 09 inches, Wuhu 8 feet 9 inches; (3rd) Anqing 10 feet 05 inches, Jiujiang 12 feet. Compared to the water levels reported at the end of last month, it has fallen another five or six inches.</p>
<p>Navigation Tonnage Reduced</p>
<p>Since the Yangtze River water level dropped, navigation has been difficult. Currently, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangshun, Jianghua, Jiangda, Jiangxin, Datong, Kuailli, Jianguo, and other vessels traveling on the Yangtze River line have reduced their cargo and passenger loads to slightly less than 1,500 tons per ship. During navigation, they must follow the deepest water level in the central waterway. If the pilot and captain are not careful, they may run aground on shallow sandbanks. All other Chinese and foreign private vessels on the Yangtze River line have also reduced their loaded tonnage.</p>
<p>Changsha Transshipment</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that Tao Lin, the general manager of the Fuchi Construction Company in this city, believes that since November of last year, the price of domestic cement has been rising continuously, and now it has reached more than two yuan per barrel. He has specially sent a letter to the Qixin China Cement Company, asking it to consider. The general idea of ​​his letter is roughly: In recent years, the voice of promoting domestic products has been very loud, and the people are deeply stimulated and happy to purchase them. The government has also promoted and guaranteed them in various ways. At this time, domestic merchants should work day and night, engage in research on how to improve raw materials, how to reduce costs, how to seek fair prices, and how to ensure smooth shipments. If, taking advantage of this opportunity to raise prices, obstruct the promotion of domestic products, and affect national construction, it is not only standing still and committing suicide with high prices, but also cutting off the vitality of national rejuvenation, which is not what domestic merchants should do. His words are extremely sincere and moving.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 5 AM, just as a torrential rain was falling, Xu Xindi, a Ningbo native woman residing at No. 35, Lane 1423, Chongye Li, Yangshupu Road, aged 14, and her left neighbor, Du Gendi (also a Ningbo native, aged 14), residing at No. 39, were holding one umbrella and walking from east to west along the side of Yangshupu Road, 190 yards west of Qiwupu Road, intending to go to the Ewo (Jardine Matheson) Cotton Mill to work. Unexpectedly, a car sped from behind, and unable to avoid it, hit both Xu and Du. Xu died instantly due to severe injuries, while Du suffered minor injuries. The car, seeing that an accident had occurred, instead accelerated and fled without a trace. A passerby, Wu Jixiang, caught a glimpse and immediately summoned an ambulance, sending the two women to Renji Hospital. Because Xu was already dead, her body was transferred to the Coroner's Office on Lunn Road for examination. After examination and treatment by a doctor, Du had already left the hospital. Upon receiving the report, the Yulin Road Police Station ordered detective Pan Yunlong to investigate. Since no one had seen the car's license plate, it was impossible to apprehend the driver. A diagram of the accident scene was drawn. Around 10 AM, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Tang, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, to the scene to examine the body. Du Gendi testified that after she and Xu were hit by the car, the car immediately drove away, so she could not see its license plate, and her waist was still slightly painful. Wu Jixiang testified that he was 43 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at No. 52, Hongyun Fang, Huade Road. At 5 AM this morning, he was on his way to Xiangtai Timber Company for work, walking towards the two women. Not long after the two women passed him, he suddenly heard a loud car sound. He immediately turned around and saw that both of them were already on the ground, and the car was still speeding away. He only saw that the car was black, the license plate was white with black characters, but he could not see the numbers. Xu Mao, the deceased's mother, testified that her husband was no longer alive, and she relied on her daughter's work for a living, so she requested justice. Prosecutor Tang, after hearing the testimonies, instructed the police station detectives to continue investigating the fleeing car. After examination, it was determined that the deceased Xu Xindi had died from injuries sustained after being hit by a car. The body was handed over to her mother, Xu Mao, who signed an agreement to claim the body for burial.</p>

<p>Li Zhifu, the county magistrate of Shanghai County, has completed his inspection of the baojia organizations and frugality movement in various districts in recent days and returned to the county government yesterday. He went to the province to report everything. According to him, although the baojia organizations in various districts have been completed, the spirit of the baojia is still lacking. Many of the bao chiefs and jia chiefs are capable, but there are also those who have a superficial understanding. To have a good spirit of baojia, there must be good baojia personnel. I (County Magistrate refers to himself) intend to provide the bao chiefs and jia chiefs with appropriate training so that they can make progress in both common sense and spirit. The education industry is generally satisfactory. Although this county is adjacent to Shanghai, the custom of frugality can still be maintained, which is commendable. This year's rice harvest is abundant, but unfortunately, the spring crop has not yet been planted, so the farmers are praying for rain. The public pays little attention to hygiene. I (County Magistrate mentions) have instructed local responsible personnel to find ways to promote it.</p>

<p>Chen Dongsheng from Ningbo, currently 52 years old, runs the Chenshengji Coal Store at 223 Feihong Road in Hongzhen. His son, Chen Xianghua, 19 years old, was recommended this spring to work at the Zhongnan Coal Ball Factory at 1032 North Chengdu Road. Because Chen Xianghua owed Bao Cunxin from Shaoxing Yuyao 20 yuan in legal tender, Bao Cunxin, along with Yan Qixun from Nanxun, Chen Meixing, and one unknown person, went to the Zhongnan Coal Ball Factory at around 10 AM on the 28th of last month. They forced Chen Xianghua into the Fuxingyuan Teahouse at 953 North Chengdu Road and demanded the 20 yuan he owed. Because Chen had no money to pay, he was beaten by these people, his face</p>
<p>injured and bleeding. They threatened to cause him trouble if he did not pay by the afternoon. Chen, young and inexperienced, returned to the factory and told his colleague, Du Huinan, what had happened. Unexpectedly, at 12:30 PM, Chen Xianghua, because the deadline was approaching and he still had no money, became extremely agitated. He secretly left the factory and disappeared. On October 30th, Zhang Guisheng, a tea server from the Ningshao Company's Xin Ningshao Steamer, delivered a pair of letters to the Zhongnan Coal Ball Factory. The factory people then learned that it was Chen Xianghua's suicide note. It detailed that he was frightened and coerced, and after leaving the factory, he pretended to return to Ningbo and boarded the Xin Ningshao Steamer. He sailed to the vicinity of the Huishan Wharf in Wusongkou and committed suicide by jumping into the river. The letter was entrusted to the Zhongnan Coal Ball Factory to be delivered to his father, Chen Dongsheng. The factory people immediately notified Chen Dongsheng, who reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Ma Zhongrong was ordered to investigate yesterday. Unexpectedly, Bao Cunxin and Yan Qixun happened to come to the Zhongnan Coal Ball Factory, intending to demand the remaining 10 yuan from Chen Xianghua. They were arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, charged them with</p>
<p>extortion by intimidation</p>
<p>and attempted fraud according to Article 346 of the Criminal Law and stated the above situation. Chen Dongsheng, the father of the deceased Chen Xianghua, testified that he did not know about his son's suicide by drowning until he received the suicide note. Witness Cao Zengrong testified that he had witnessed the two defendants beating Chen Xianghua's face until it bled. Bao Cunxin confessed that he had known Chen Xianghua for two years. On October 12th of last year, Lu Yin wanted to open a small coal ball shop and invited him to invest 20 yuan, which he paid and had a written receipt for. This time, he was just asking for the money owed and did not intend to intimidate him. Yan Qixun also denied beating Chen Xianghua. Judge Huang Risheng, after reviewing the statements, ordered the two defendants to be detained and scheduled to re-summon witnesses on Saturday of this week for further verification.</p>

<p>The Hongzhang Cotton Mill at 381 Maigen Road has been experiencing labor unrest since September 28th. Although mediation by party and government organs has not yet found a solution, there have been disturbances at the factory from time to time. Recently, two workers from the factory mistakenly identified a female worker from the Yong'an Cotton Mill as a Hongzhang worker and prevented her from going to work. They were arrested by the police and sent to the First Special Court, which sentenced them to 20 days of detention. Then, the day before yesterday, around 6 AM, another disturbance broke out at the factory. A group of male and female workers prevented the night shift workers from leaving the factory and prevented the day shift workers from entering the factory to work, and they stopped the machines. The factory telegraphed the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered Detective Lu Gendi and others to rush to the scene. They arrested two female workers, both named Wang Abao (both from Jiangbei, 18 years old), and one Chen Xiaoda. After questioning, it was revealed that they were instructed by male workers Sun Xiangsheng, Shen A'gen, and Xu Awu. The police then arrested Sun and the others and discovered that the workers who had already been laid off from Hongzhang had organized a union at 20 Chongde Alley, Hengfeng Road in Zhabei, and were constantly spreading rumors and inciting unrest. The disturbance that day was caused by these people spreading rumors that the factory would reduce workers' wages by 20%. The workers, being ignorant, were fooled by them. Yesterday morning, they were also sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated the facts of the case and charged them with obstructing freedom according to Article 304 of the Criminal Law. Judge Ye Shengchao questioned each defendant and sentenced the two Wang Abaos and Chen Xiaoda to five days of detention each, and Sun Xiangsheng, Shen A'gen, and Xu Awu to 15 days of detention each as a warning. The Wangs and others accepted the verdict willingly.</p>

<h3 id="e184">The Sauce Garden Industry in Shanghai (A General Overview of Shanghai Industry and Commerce, No. 36) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>(3) Types of Soy Sauce and Their Production Methods - There are four types of soy sauce: "Double Set," "Set Oil," "Mother Oil," and "Top Oil." The difference lies in the quality of the material. Generally, soy sauce made from one catty of fermented soybeans producing only one catty of soy sauce is called "Double Set." Soy sauce made from one catty of fermented soybeans producing one and a half catties of soy sauce is called "Set Oil." Soy sauce made from one catty of fermented soybeans producing two catties of soy sauce is called "Mother Oil." As for "Top Oil," it is almost entirely made from soy sauce residue. The method of making soy sauce is extremely simple. That is, fermented soybeans are stored in a cloth bag, and the mouth of the bag is tightly tied. Then, the oil is squeezed out with a wooden press, and soy sauce is made. As mentioned before, the quality of soy sauce should be best with "Double Set," followed by "Set Oil" and "Mother Oil," and "Top Oil" is the worst, with a salty and bitter taste. Some sauce gardens, for the sake of profit, often add pure sugar (made from barley malt) to inferior soy sauce to relieve the salty and bitter taste, so as to sell it at a high price. This is what we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>In addition to the above types, there are also "Autumn Oil" from sauce gardens in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou. The best is called "Sanfu Autumn Oil." The sauce gardens in Zhenjiang and Yangzhou focus on making pickles, placing vegetables, radishes, etc., in the sauce. The aged sauce for the pickles, every "dog days" of summer, must be like making new sauce, and then exposed to the sun and dew. The sauce extracted from this re-exposed aged sauce is filtered through a cloth bag and becomes "Fu Oil." If this kind of aged sauce has been exposed to the sun and dew for three "dog days," then the soy sauce obtained is "Sanfu Autumn Oil," and its taste is extraordinarily delicious. The reason is that the raw materials of the sauce are already delicious, and then the deliciousness of various vegetables and melons permeates into the sauce, making it even more delicious. In addition, there are so-called "soy sauce essence" and "some kind of fresh juice" on the market, and there are quite a few differences in quality. One type is manufactured by larger seasoning powder factories when manufacturing flavor powder. They use flour to make gluten, then use hydrochloric acid and other chemicals for decomposition, and after chemical action, the toxic substances are removed to become soy sauce essence, so it is fresh and non-toxic. Another type is made by profiteers who buy the remaining malt residue from flavor powder production at a low price and extract the residual juice from it. Therefore, it often contains several toxic substances and is not hygienic. However, this kind of inferior soy sauce essence is very cheap, so it can be popular on the market. This is what we must distinguish.</p>

<h3 id="e185">Appraising the Contribution of National Goods <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Appraising national goods cannot be done merely based on the surface; one must study the content and various relationships before one can obtain accurate results.</p>
<p>First, one should base the appraisal on the principles of the seven classes of national goods promulgated by the former Ministry of Industry and Commerce.</p>
<p>Second, one should study whether the manufacturing technology has reached the point of improvement.</p>
<p>Third, one should compare previous products to see how much progress has been made and how much they have been improved.</p>
<p>Fourth, one should study whether the raw materials used are sourced from domestic production. If not, is it because there are truly no domestic sources?</p>
<p>Fifth, one should study the social value of this product and what benefits it brings to society.</p>
<p>Sixth, one should study whether this product is cheaper and better than similar foreign products and whether it is sufficient to resist foreign products.</p>
<p>Seventh, one should study the supply of this product. There is a place to study whether it is oversupplied or undersupplied.</p>
<p>Eighth, one should study whether this product has reached standardization and can be uniformly produced.</p>
<p>These eight items are the keys to appraising national goods, and everyone must study them carefully.</p>
<h3 id="e186">A Visit to the China Pencil Factory <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Tongfang</p>
<p>Every year, the customs reports show that more than ten million dollars flow out of the country. This huge leakage is undoubtedly our fatal wound. Among these more than ten million dollars of leakage, foreign pencils seize our money, also accounting for two to three million yuan. The cost of a mere pencil can accumulate to such an astonishing number. No wonder the invasion of foreign goods amounts to tens of millions or hundreds of millions of yuan.</p>
<p>While foreign pencils are rampantly selling well in our market, the China Pencil Factory, a national goods enterprise, was founded in July of the 23rd year of the Republic. The various national goods pencils produced have the potential to surpass the exquisite and practical foreign pencils.</p>
<p>The China Pencil Factory was founded by Mr. Wu Gengxu with a capital of 50,000 yuan. Mr. Wu is a famous industrialist who studied pencil manufacturing in Japan. He is currently the associate manager and factory director of the factory. The manager is Mr. Zhang Weishi.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 22nd of last month, I paid a special visit to the factory at 276 Xiexu Road, Dapuqiao. Mr. Wu personally received me. According to him, the factory is currently divided into three departments: core wood, core making, and finished product. There are more than 50 workers. Regarding the raw materials for the pencils, the factory tries to use domestic goods as much as possible within the possible range. For example, the clay is sourced from Yixing, the pencil lead is purchased from Zhenjiang, and the wood, except for ordinary pencils which use poplar wood produced in the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, Jiangxi, and Hubei, the excellent wood has to be purchased from the United States due to environmental constraints. All the machines are designed by Mr. Wu and built by the Shunchang Iron Works. The cowhide glue is produced by the Shanghai Chitai Glue Factory, the alcohol is produced by the China Alcohol Factory, and other items such as paint are purchased from the Guohua Industrial Raw Materials Company. Therefore, it can be said that the products produced by this factory are made entirely from domestic raw materials. The factory's products are branded with Ding Pi, Aircraft, National Salvation Aviation, and Primary School Student trademarks. In addition to manufacturing ordinary black pencils, the factory also manufactures various high-grade pencils, drawing pencils, red and blue pencils, copying pencils, crayons, etc., with a daily output of 250 baskets (each basket contains 12 dozen, and the wholesale price is from 1.2 yuan to 7.5 yuan per basket). The sales area covers the whole country, and even the Nanyang Islands and Siam have the footprints of the factory's products. The annual total turnover is about 200,000 yuan. On the one hand, it is indeed because the factory strives for excellence in its products. On the other hand, it is due to the enthusiastic care of all sectors of society and the adoption of national goods, which can block a lot of leakage.</p>
<p>Then, under the leadership of Mr. Wu, I visited the factory workshop. The process of making pencils is that the clay is first washed to remove impurities, and then mixed with pencil lead powder. After drying, it is rolled into thin sheets. After it is hardened, it is made into lead rods, and then a lead core machine is used to make it as thick as the lead core. Then, the lead core is placed in a pottery pot and dried once in a furnace. The two ends of the lead core are cut to the specified length. This is the work of making the lead core. The board part is to first use a grooving machine to dig small pieces of wood into slotted strips for placing the lead core. The pencil lead is placed in the slot, and then other wooden boards are firmly glued on with glue. A machine is used to cut it into a circular or hexagonal shape, and the uneven lengths at both ends are cut off and polished. Then, it is placed in a paint application machine, painted several times, and then printed and packaged before it is completed.</p>
<p>The factory's machinery and equipment are very complete, and it also pays great attention to the welfare of the workers. For example, the factory is equipped with powerful bellows to absorb dust and wood chips in the workshop; workers engaged in powder work are equipped with goggles and mouth covers; machine gears and high-speed saw blades are covered with protective nets or coin covers to prevent danger. Special attention is also paid to worker education. Apprentice refresher schools and labor literacy schools are set up to educate apprentices and female workers. Books and magazines are also provided in the dormitory. Other safety equipment, hygiene equipment, sports equipment, and medical equipment are all perfect. Although the factory was established for a very short period of time, it was able to improve its products with meager resources, compete with foreign goods, and gain considerable power. That kind of hard work and attention to worker welfare is worthy of admiration.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Yarn Flower Under the Manipulation of Major Players, the Yarn Market is Quite Chaotic, with Four Different Prices This Month and a Precarious Situation. Spot Yarn Trading with Guangdong Merchants is Gradually Developing <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is experiencing unpredictable rises and falls, and the situation is becoming increasingly chaotic. Major players have been manipulating it intensely recently, causing market prices to fluctuate erratically. The future situation is difficult to predict. The spot yarn business is seeing increased development with Guangdong merchants showing strong interest from various parties. Securities firms and gold firms are fueling the situation, leading to more frequent trading and greater volatility.</p>
<p>Morning Rise, Afternoon Reversal, Forward Contracts Weaken</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the situation this month remained firm and bullish, with chaotic and inconsistent bids from both bulls and bears. Forward contracts were more moderate. The second session was slightly flat. In the third session, the current month jumped sharply by 2.9 yuan, reaching 229 yuan. Deferred months entered a better state. Spot yarn trading was more active than before. By the close, bulls took profits, and the current month fell back by 2 yuan, while deferred months also dropped by 0.8 to 0.9 yuan. As a result, the current month closed 2 yuan higher than the previous day, while deferred months rose by 0.489 yuan to 1 yuan. At the afternoon opening, those who profited from the current month released their holdings, leading to a relaxation, and deferred contracts weakened. The second and third sessions continued to decline. As a result, the current month fell by 3 yuan from the morning close, while deferred contracts fell by 0.7 to 2 yuan. Run Kang, Shen Ji, and Yu Da sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. Sales included He Xing (3350 bales), Qing Feng (2250 bales), Chang Ji (1400 bales), Rui Da (3750 bales), Shen Ji (1000 bales), Wang Tai Xing (4050 bales), Da Chang (1950 bales), Xin Cheng (1450 bales), and Ming De (3590 bales). Purchases included Xie Cheng (1400 bales), Tong Ji (2200 bales), Yu Da (3000 bales), Jin Chang (2500 bales), Feng Tai (1700 bales), Yong Chang (600 bales), Ji Feng (1090 bales), Heng Yi (2000 bales), and Da Feng (1050 bales). The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Total 599,650</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Weak at 1,900 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were relatively high. Total purchases by various merchants throughout the day were 1,890 bales, with selling prices up 2 yuan. The purchase amounts by each merchant are listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 1,385 Shantou 50 Mainland 280</p>

<h3 id="e190">Speculation Reactivated, Cotton Prices Surge and Plunge, with a Difference of Around One Yuan Between the Highest and Lowest Prices <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market followed the yarn market's surge in the morning, but profit-taking in the afternoon led to a rapid decline in prices. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of the day was around one yuan. This situation suggests rampant speculation. However, overseas cotton markets were lackluster.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Falls by 0.4 to 0.5 Yuan at the End</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton market, market sentiment was scattered due to the flat and weak conditions in the Indian and American cotton markets. Prices for all months fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. In the second session, news of tight yarn markets led to a sudden surge in buying, with prices rising sharply by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. By the third closing, some profit-takers released their holdings, and the market returned to weakness. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan compared to the previous day's close. At the afternoon opening, market sentiment turned downwards, and the situation was very weak, with prices falling in every session. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.35 to 0.45 yuan compared to the morning close. Sales included He Xing (10,100 dan), Ming De (4,700 dan), Da Fu (5,900 dan), Geng Feng (7,100 dan), Ren Feng (2,800 dan), Da Chang Cheng (5,500 dan), Tai Chang (4,000 dan), Chang Feng (6,500 dan), Run Kang (8,800 dan), Da Chang (1,700 dan), Wang Tai Xing (2,000 dan), Da Qing (2,400 dan), and Yi Kang (1,700 dan).

<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the American cotton market, prices for all months ranged from unchanged to a rise of 4 points. Early morning news from Liverpool was positive, and the market situation was stable. However, due to the unrest caused by the ship crew strike, general merchants lacked interest, leading to limited trading and a sluggish market. In the afternoon, long positions were closed, and prices weakened. Then, factory purchases led to another firming. The close was stable. Spot prices were unchanged, while futures prices ranged from a rise of 1 point to a fall of 3 points. British spot cotton was unchanged, while futures rose by 1 point. The long positions closed and futures sold by Indian cotton were absorbed by Japanese and European exporters. Later, due to positive news from Liverpool, the market situation returned to strength. Pingguoer and Bailuoxi fell by half a rupee, and Aomula fell by 1.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd telegram):</p>

<p>(Tianjin Quick Mail) The yarn and flower situation in this city is very weak. Because the prices are too high, actual sales are intermittent. Market conditions are downstream. The Baofu merchants bought 15 bales of 17-count San Guang yarn for 226 yuan, including consolidated tax. Also, the cotton market is dull. Donghe flower is 55.5 yuan, Western American type is 53 yuan, and Western flower is 43.9 to 44 yuan, with 650 pieces traded.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the yarn market's morning rise and afternoon reversal, and the improved sales of spot yarn, the piece goods market was slightly encouraged. Spot and warehouse order prices for fine cloths and twills of Eastern goods rose by about 0.05 yuan per piece. This was largely because Japanese factories were still willing to dump forward contracts as much as possible, which were cheaper than spot goods by about 0.5 yuan per piece, causing uncertainty among holders. Actual sales were also very flat. Dyeing factories experienced sluggish sales of colored cloths and twills, resulting in very little appetite for fine cloths. Yesterday, Yong Gu Pan cloth Pioneer Yuan Yu silk both fell by 0.5 yuan per piece due to the drop in the price of white坯last week. Imprinted Zhen Gong, Serge, and Tianjin merchants in this street slightly procured, and selling prices were gradually loosened. This factory's coarse cloths and heavy goods supply gradually increased, and the market gradually had inventory buildup. Selling prices tended to go downstream. Retail sales were sporadic. Only military uniforms had slightly small-volume purchases of a little over a hundred pieces in recent days. Yihua Factory's light and heavy coarse cloths were purchased by Tianjin merchants in larger quantities, also close to a hundred pieces each day. Colored goods, straight tribute, Wanxian merchants purchased fifty-odd cases. The appetite for goods such as serge and line cloth from various regions was weak, and the market was very bleak.</p>

<p>Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was weak and listless across all months after the morning opening. Because foreign wheat prices were slightly up by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan and there was a timely rain in the evening, the sentiment for both near and deferred months loosened at the opening. The opening price for this month was only 0.74 yuan, down 0.03 yuan from the previous day. The remaining months fell by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan, with the farthest month, such as April, falling by a large 0.06 yuan. This was because farmland could be sown with wheat after receiving a thorough rain, which impacted sentiment. By the afternoon opening, near months slightly moved due to merchant activity, while there were few sellers of deferred months, so sentiment was relatively stable, rebounding by 0.01 yuan from the morning. Looking ahead, if there is more timely rain and the situation does not create problems, prices should not rise excessively.</p>

<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a consistent decline across all months at the morning opening. With the abundant and thorough timely rain, farmers were naturally pleased, so opening prices for all months were successively short by 0.06 to 0.1 yuan. However, trading stagnated and was not lively. By the afternoon opening, sentiment was flat and tired, and trading was not smooth. All months were largely similar to the morning and hovered. Looking ahead, if the weather is smooth, sentiment should gradually loosen. The spot wheat market was steady with fatigue. High-priced goods were still called 0.05 yuan, while medium-grade goods were softer, with prices ranging from 6 yuan to 5.7, 5.8, and 5.9 yuan. Three factories including Fuxin purchased 10,000 bags from the whole city.</p>

<p>Since autumn, there have been few large-scale transactions in the soybean cake sales market. However, retail sales have been particularly lively compared to previous years, and prices have fallen without rising. This is because supply is greater than demand, and Dalian has been frequently falling, making it difficult for market conditions to attract attention from all parties. However, recently, factories have been ordering large quantities of Sipingwei soybeans and are secretly preparing for the output of manufactured goods. It is said that Futou bean cakes were first obtained the night before, resulting in each factory having 80,000 pieces of Si Pai cakes, scheduled to be delivered in January and February next year. The price for January was 1.75 yuan, and the price for February was 1.77 yuan.

<p>Yesterday, guest 　remained strong, but destocking was sluggish, and the market showed weakness, especially with Guangdong merchants stopping purchases of machine-milled rough 　, further weakening the rice market. Shantou and Tianjin merchants made no inquiries. Only this street made slight inquiries. Henan merchants purchased nearly 1,000 bags of Gan early, while other merchants had no movements. Only 2,031 bags of Jiangxi rice were opened in the unified city. The shortage of transactions was the first in recent months, and after the rain, sentiment went down, and cargo owners sought to sell quickly. Therefore, yesterday's sales of glutamic acid were all reduced by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Thin Rice Still Sluggish in This Street <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various merchants were similar to the previous, with a total of more than 9,000 stones from the 43rd and 44th berths. Thin rice was still the majority. After the thin rice market turned stable in the previous market, the situation has become tight due to the limited arrivals and the continued purchases of 3,000 to 4,000 bags by merchants from Qingyan and Tianjin. The market situation has also been more prosperous, and the market situation has tightened. As for the thick Xin Geng, the situation is still stable. The road to Du Yang Jian has turned slack, and the price has only been adjusted a few points due to the higher market standard. Xin Yin Yuan is mediocre.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 43 or 44 sources of goods from various gangs in Hexia, and the prices were tight in the morning due to the cloudy weather. After the market, sales were smooth and unchanged, and the situation was soft. The price of Xin Geng was also seen, the road to thin rice was still stagnant on this street, and the guest gangs continued to move, and the price stood still. The price of Bian Yuan was also a little cheaper by 0.1 yuan, and the price of Yin Yuan was peaceful because there were not many arrivals. The price of Yang Bu Du Jian was flat and tired, and the other rice was similar to before.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Securities: Northern Merchants Sell, Public Bonds Fall Across the Board <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange turned tired because the No. 54 and others had bought enough, and there was no need, and the Northern Merchants had sold again. There were rumors on the market, and people's hearts were slightly softened, which shows that the bond market's uncertainty is completely dominated by the unconscious psychology of the various merchants. What is the path to follow? It is impossible to explore. In the near future, it will have to be expanded. The bond market will continue to have major changes. Yesterday's experience: At the opening in the morning, the Northern Gang sold a little, and the market prices were all tired, mostly small 0.05, 0.1 to 0.25 yuan. In the second session, No. 5 and No. 33 and others bought a little, and No. 35 continued to sell. The market was tired and firm, up and down by 0.05 and 0.1 yuan, and entered a sluggish situation again. The first auction in the afternoon was firm, and then it became tired again because the Northern Gang continued to release it. At the close, there were rumors of Suiyuan and Tianjin on the market, and at the same time, the No. 14 and No. 35 of the Northern Gang sold very quickly, and the No. 10 and No. 47 also sold a lot. The market price was quite tired, all of them were small 0.15 to 0.25 yuan, but the long-term Type A was slightly better by 0.05 yuan due to the swap relationship. As a result, the market price fell by 0.15 to 0.5 yuan across the board. The total number of effects was 4,020,000 yuan. The results of the increase and decrease are compared in the following table.

At this time, it rose slightly, but many parties also closed out, and gradually fell back. However, the big players tried hard to maintain the low price, so the big throw was difficult to change, and the struggle was very difficult. The market was very lively with major players buying and selling, but because both sides were limited, the effect was there, but the situation was even more stagnant, and it still only fluctuated by 0.2 yuan. The price of Indian silver was reported to be up 2 Annas, and it was still tired in the end. The market situation for the day is recorded below.</p>

<h3 id="e203">Metals　Green Lead Factories See Activity Again　Raw Silk Sells Well, Price Rises by Two or Three Jiao <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Previously, due to the situation, the outlet for green lead was limited to the military, and trading by merchants and factories had largely come to a standstill. Recently, the situation has eased, so factories in this city, for practical reasons, have become active in green lead transactions again. It is estimated that a total of six to seven hundred bars have been traded, mainly purchased by yellow ochre factories and paint companies. There were only a few purchases by merchants for inland rivers and the Qingjiang route. The market price is reportedly twenty-six yuan per load (on credit), while spot transactions can be two or three jiao cheaper.</p>
<p>Recently, due to scarce arrivals and brisk sales, the raw silk market has been very good. The market price is six yuan and thirty-four jiao per picul, with another two or three jiao added. However, construction gangs and those from the Four Hankous are giving offers, and the imbalance between supply and demand is causing the trend to become more outstanding. Yesterday, some were sold for six yuan and five jiao. It is reported that the amount of spot goods on the market is particularly scarce, so the outlook for the future is very optimistic.</p>

All of these saw transactions. Other prices remained unchanged. Our factory's Zhenji No. 1 fine white sugar was priced at 10 yuan and 50 cents, with No. 1345 following suit. No. 1 grade sugar saw Chaozhou merchants offering Chaoqing at over 70 yuan, with a price of 13 yuan and 20 cents. Several dozen bags of ordinary red cotton sugar were priced at 14 yuan and 50 cents. Yesterday, Chisha Denny imported 19,072 bags of No. 24 coarse white Dutch sugar and 5,020 bags of red Dutch sugar.</p>

<p>Since the arrival of new black dates, both arrivals and sales have been increasing daily. In total, 4,000 to 5,000 packages have been offered by merchants from various locations. Currently, top-quality Guangfu dates are priced at 35-38 yuan, top-quality Dongchang dates at 32-33 yuan, top-quality Boping dates at 33-34 yuan, top-quality Gaogzhuang dates at 25-26 yuan, second-quality Gaogzhuang dates at 22 yuan, top-quality Gaotong dates at 17-18 yuan, ordinary dates at 14-15 yuan, and second-grade dates at 11-12 yuan. Quality varies.</p>
<p>Candied orange peel from Shantou has continued to arrive in the past few days, with a dozen or so pieces arriving, increasing in cost. Due to the small quantity, the market has tightened slightly. Yesterday's offers were all sold, with prices rising by another yuan compared to the previous session. The quality of the goods is also higher than the previous batch, and the trend is firm and stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the domestic and international silk markets remained sluggish. Prices for Chinese and Japanese silk products in New York declined uniformly. Japanese silk fell by 1 cent to 83 cents and by 2 cents to 79 cents. Shanghai silk fell by 3 cents, and Guangdong silk fell by 2 cents. At the exchange, near-term sales fell by half a cent, while long-term sales rose by 1 cent. There were no changes in Lyon. Yokohama was closed due to the Meiji Festival. The Shanghai silk market saw very few exports, and user activity was also minimal. Market prices continued to decline slightly by 3-5 yuan. However, observing the general silk factories, many are gradually suspending operations due to a lack of dry cocoons. The supply of factory silk is unlikely to be abundant, so current silk prices may be able to maintain a reasonable level.</p>
<h3 id="e207">New York Silk Market Conditions Were Good in October <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>According to Reuters, reports on various raw silk categories in New York during October showed that Shanghai silk and European silk in the United States performed better than the previous month, except for Japanese silk. At the same time, imports of Japanese silk decreased in October, and inventories of other silk products also decreased, leading to a rise in world silk prices in the second half of October. During the month, Chinese silk exports to the United States increased by 277 bales compared to the previous month. Sales of Chinese silk increased by 821 bales, and Chinese silk inventories decreased by 411 bales. Detailed tables are as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market conditions became smoother. Transactions of Zhenmei green tea from Tunxi Zhuang were slightly more active. Ping Shui Pearl Tea and Needle-shaped green tea were opened by Xiehe, Tongfu, Baochang, Yih, and other companies. The city's total transaction volume of green tea reached more than 800 boxes. Top quality Zhenmei was offered at 60 yuan, top quality needle-shaped tea at 35 yuan, and Pearl tea at 52 yuan, slightly firmer than before.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Theoretical Research: The Latest Revolution in the Theory of Gonorrhea <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Chen Minbo, Graduate of the Imperial Medical University of Japan</p>
<p>...Local treatments are beneficial for diuresis and turbidity reduction... Methods are gradually becoming perfect... The newest treatment for systemic gonococcal infection is... Non-specific therapy.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea has always been considered a difficult disease to treat because there has never been an effective cure, hence the saying "no medicine can cure gonorrhea" has become prevalent. In fact, this is a 19th-century superstition, a inevitable response in times of scientific backwardness.</p>
<p>Since human society entered the 20th century, scientific advances have allowed scientific management of all things. This is particularly evident in the medical field. Observing the gradual innovation and perfection of all past therapies, it is evident that we humans living in this 20th century can fully enjoy the warmth of scientific glory, a happiness that patients of old could hardly have dreamed of!</p>
<p>In today's era of brilliant civilization and special effects, the theory of gonorrhea is presenting us with a major revolutionary fact. It reverses the old, slow, and inappropriate therapies and establishes itself in the field of treatment with a brand-new look. This is the greatest benefit of today's gonorrhea medical community.</p>
<p>The establishment of the world-shaking non-specific therapy, Unse Pecifische! The basis of this therapy is to administer a protein body to a gonococcal animal after inoculation, and extract the anti-gonococcal factor from the animal's body to perform serum therapy. Therefore, it is also called protein body therapy! Its effectiveness and speed are unmatched by any other method.</p>
<p>Based on this theory, it is an even more precious fact to take the protein body from the body of inoculated animals to make a preparation for internal use like Narcissus! As such, it not only saves the trouble of injections but also makes it easier for male and female patients to treat themselves at home. The method is excellent, and there are absolutely no drawbacks. This kind of oral gonorrhea medicine is the "Kelinong," a combination of protein body and yellow pigment! The effective action of this agent lies in the "non-specificity" of the protein body. After taking it, it stimulates the function of cells throughout the human body, causing a strong</p>
<p>forceful antibacterial action, striving to wipe out the gonococci in the deep and subtle tissues of the whole body. On the one hand, it promotes the vitality of red and white blood cells, enriches the body's resistance, and avoids the weakness, bone pain, and arthritis after gonococcal infection. On the other hand, it can also correct the inflammation of the seminal vesicles and testicles caused by gonococcal infection, so the testicles become swollen and hard after taking this medicine! Also, for gonococcal prostatitis and uterine inflammation contracted by women from their husbands,</p>
<p>this medicine is especially effective for leucorrhea. However, for women's leucorrhea, it is best to use "Kardi Dishi vaginal tablets" as suppositories at the same time, inserting one or two tablets into the vagina every night to cleanse the dirt, which can quickly restore cleanliness!</p>
<p>Protein body therapies like "Kelinong" can truly be said to be the most successful scientific crystallization of the 20th century!</p>
<h3 id="e210">Appropriate Treatment: The Origin of Insomnia and Memory Loss <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>...There is a mutual relationship with sexual neurasthenia... The root cause of this disease must first be dissected...</p>
<p>Insomnia and loss of memory are the most obvious symptoms of neurasthenia. There are many causes of it, and there are hundreds of changes. This disease is mostly seen in young people who have not fully developed, and the reason is that masturbation is harmful, or excessive sexual activity damages the puberty glands that produce hormones. Furthermore, due to the relationship of masturbation, the brain nerves are also greatly stimulated, and the nerves gradually weaken. Therefore, there are symptoms of insomnia and weak memory, which are manifestations of neurasthenia. Also, due to the loss of the puberty glands, the sexual organs cannot develop as usual, they are abnormally small, almost like children, and there are symptoms of sexual neurasthenia such as nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and weak penile erection. These symptoms often have a mutual relationship with neurasthenia. Therefore, if the symptoms of sexual neurasthenia worsen, then insomnia and loss of memory will inevitably be more profound, and we should treat them together, not separately.</p>
<p>So, how should we treat it appropriately? Of course, we should think about this problem from the root cause, that is, to replenish the hormones that have been lost, and "Buti Kang" is the most effective agent for this. Because this agent is made from the hormones of vigorous and healthy animals using scientific methods, it has a special function for neurasthenia. Therefore, it has a vigorous endocrine function, especially the function of the gonads, which has a thorough transformation effect. After taking it, this "Buti Kang" is delivered to all parts of the body by the blood in a short period of time, which not only promotes the development of sexual organs and the health of sexual nerves. It can also fill the muscles, accelerate all metabolic functions, and eliminate all stale substances as much as possible. As a result, the spirit is refreshed, the memory is increased, and the brain nerves are also adjusted and strengthened due to the hormone supplementation. As a result, insomnia and loss of memory are completely cured. As for nocturnal emission, it can be taken together with "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" and can be cured at the same time. This is what I have obtained in clinical practice after graduating from the Russian Labor University Medical School, and thousands of people have been cured by taking this medicine.</p>

<p>Impotence and shortness... Marital discord</p>
<p>Mr. Han Futian, 29 years old. Banking industry. (Cause of the disease) - When he was young, he was poisoned by obscene books, which led to masturbation and the abuse of reproductive organs, resulting in the destruction of performance and hindering development. (Symptoms) - Married in the 20th year of the Republic of China, due to lack of restraint in sexual affairs, the kidney essence was greatly damaged, and he gradually felt mentally depressed, his thinking became dull, and his memory was reduced. The pleasure of husband and wife was also greatly reduced, because of premature ejaculation, impotence, and no ability. The sexual organs were also very short and small, and the couple's feelings were precarious. This spring, he was introduced by a friend to come to me for treatment. (Diagnosis) - I diagnosed hormone function damage and sexual development obstruction, so I used the latest therapy, took the hormone preparation "Buti Kang" to supplement and nourish his hormones, and promote his development. On the one hand, I applied electrotherapy, and he was completely cured in about one month and seven days. What is even more amazing is that the development has been enhanced and is no different from ordinary people!</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and insomnia... Frustration in love</p>
<p>Mr. Hou Yinyu, 20 years old, academia. (Cause of the disease) - Due to the temptation of bad friends, he contracted masturbation, and then nocturnal emission occurred frequently. (Symptoms) - Vivid dreams came frequently, and nocturnal emission became more and more serious, often twice a night. He was mentally and physically exhausted, and his studies declined greatly. (Diagnosis) - I diagnosed loose sperm lock, so I took "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to treat his nocturnal emission and "Buti Kang" to supplement his weakness. He was completely cured in less than four weeks. Yesterday, Mr. Hou wrote to say that he has been engaged in mid-month.</p>

<p>...The face is sallow as if one has returned from the hunger line... There are many reasons, and ovarian dysfunction is the main reason.</p>
<p>Some women are as beautiful as peaches and plums, while others are as pale as vegetables. What is the reason for this? According to the research results of recent doctors, it is known that it depends on the health of the ovarian function. Because the ovary is the most important part of the female reproductive system, the health of a body is mostly determined by this important organ. If the ovarian function loses its physiological state and cannot perform the work of ovulation, then menstruation will become difficult, blood circulation will be obstructed, and anemia will occur, so the jade face will be haggard, showing a chlorotic state, and the nerves will also fall into weakness, such as headaches, insomnia, mental irritability, back pain, and white discharge flowing continuously, so the body will become weaker and the complexion will become more and more chlorotic and terrible. Problems will also occur in women's fertility, because the ovary is the main organ for pregnancy, just like the testicles of men. If the testicles are diseased, there will naturally be no sperm production. Since I graduated from the Army Medical University, whenever I encountered women with chlorosis caused by ovarian dysfunction. I used "Bu Nv Rong" to adjust the ovarian function, promote the continuous production of new blood, and because of the increase in hormones, the metabolic function is also accelerated, fat is filled, breasts and buttocks are expanded and raised, and the face is delicate, beautiful as ever. Those with leucorrhea can use "Cardi Xuedishi vaginal tablets" as suppositories, then chlorosis and leucorrhea can all be cured. This is the most fundamental and correct treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Most Stubborn Gonorrhea Is Effective <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Deng Yuanhe</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is a stubborn venereal disease, because the diplococcus gonococcus has the function of being good at moving around, cold resistance, and antitoxin, but at the very beginning of gonorrhea, its nest is only in the anterior urethra, which is the easiest to clean up and cure. Once acute gonorrhea turns into chronic gonorrhea, its nest is no longer in one place. Therefore, treatment is more difficult than in the acute stage. However, if it invades the paraurethral duct, this cunning gonococcus is even more difficult to capture. Whenever gonococci invade the paraurethral duct, because the opening of this duct is very small and narrow, once it goes in, it cannot come out. Although the patient's urine is no different from usual, it is not turbid, (but often when urinating for the first time in the morning, a gonococcal string is seen, and at ordinary times, when the glans is pressed with a finger, turbid gonococcal strings are also squeezed out). Therefore, it often infects wives, because it is not easy to take care of.</p>
<p>I have also encountered this disease, such as Mr. Yi Dayun, he is a young man who is addicted to online games and drinking. After suffering from gonorrhea, he still overdrinks without restraint, and he is not careful in sexual affairs. For several years, not only has the disease not been cured, but he has also infected his wife, Ms. So-and-so, with gonorrhea, but Mr. Yi's disease does not feel any pain or have any symptoms, but the urine is turbid after fatigue. Later, I treated him. After examination, I knew that he was suffering from paraurethritis, so I instructed him to take "Kelinong" so that the effect of the medicine would directly exert a bactericidal effect in the paraurethral duct. On the one hand, he was asked to go to Dr. Yao Juyan's office for electrotherapy, and he was completely cured in five weeks. As for his wife's gonococcal leucorrhea, he was also instructed to take "Kelinong" externally and use "Cardi Xuedishi vaginal tablets" as suppositories. After three or four weeks of treatment, he was also completely cured. Therefore, "Kelinong" is indeed a very suitable oral medicine for curing stubborn gonorrhea, and it is popular at home and abroad.</p>

<p>— Physician Chen Shaohua</p>
<p>Leucorrhea is the most common disease in gynecology. Patients often neglect it because of its prevalence, and as a result, hundreds of changes occur. The most obvious symptoms are vaginal erosion, inflammation, swelling, and pain that interfere with menstruation and sexual intercourse. Therefore, there is abdominal distension, and the spirit is depressed, and the body is lost. Especially worrying is the consequence of infertility and the breakdown of two-sex love. Therefore, it is necessary to engage in a fundamental rescue as soon as possible. So that the happiness of women will not disappear forever.</p>
<p>At this time of clear autumn and refreshing air, this kind of leucorrhea should be treated in time, so as not to affect the health in winter. "Cardi Xuedishi vaginal tablets" is a very effective external suppository in recent times. According to my detailed research in clinical practice, "Cardi Xuedishi vaginal tablets" does have the effect of antiseptic, anti-secretion, anti-inflammatory and bactericidal. Can remove leucorrhea completely in a short period of time. However, if it is caused by gonorrhea, you can take "Kelinong". If leucorrhea is caused by menstruation or irregular menstruation, or physical weakness, you can take "Bu Nv Rong", which can also regulate menstruation and remove leucorrhea. Doctors from all over the world are recommending this tablet.</p>

<p>Gonorrhea with Blood Drops After Urination</p>
<p>Gonococcal inflammation is most likely to invade the internal urethral opening from the posterior urethra, and affect the nearby bladder mucosa. It further invades the remaining part of the bladder, and thus causes cystitis. The patient feels frequent urination, pain when urinating, and turbid urine, high fever, loss of appetite, and general discomfort. Those who suffer from pure acute cystitis urinate once every one or two hours, or even every two or thirty minutes, so they cannot sleep peacefully at night and develop insomnia. The pain is unbearable. In addition, the upper part of the pubic bone and the perineum also feel painful, especially when it is radiated to the urethra, bladder, anus and other parts through which the cystitis has passed.</p>
<p>However, the pain of cystitis is not limited to this. Often after urination, followed by blood droplets. These blood droplets are called Terminale Haematurie, so the treatment of this disease should never be carried out by local therapy, such as transmembranous sterilization and other gonorrhea medicines are difficult to work. Therefore, the range of these cystitis is very large. And the gonococci have run around in all directions. It is difficult to eliminate them in one place. After many years of careful research, I know that this disease must be treated with oral "Kelinong" to stimulate the cells of the whole body, so as to produce an anti-gonococcal toxin to kill the gonococci and play the effects of anti-inflammation, detumescence, and diuresis. On the one hand, use long and short wave therapy to exert the power of eliminating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Yi'e, living in Qingdao Road. He was 24 years old. He accidentally lost his virginity and contracted gonorrhea after drinking alcohol. Because the treatment was not proper, and he took inferior medicine by mistake, he turned into cystitis. He had frequent urination, dozens of times a day and night. He became insomnia, and blood was seen after each urination. The perineum, pubic bone, anus, and other parts all felt painful. I asked him to treat him. In addition to electrotherapy, I prescribed "Kelinong" to kill bacteria, reduce inflammation, diuresis, relieve pain, and prevent spoilage and swelling. He was completely cured in just four weeks. However, because of insomnia, the nerves are inevitably weakened, so I instructed him to go to the Zhongxi Pharmacy to buy "Buti Kang" for two weeks and he recovered. To this day, drinking and working hard have no morbid state. It has been three years since the root was established.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Harm and Abstinence of Opium <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Zhonglin, M.D., Minantong Medical University</p>
<p>Never take abstinence medicine indiscriminately! You must pay attention to cell strength.</p>
<p>It is really easy to talk about drugs to quit smoking? Because tobacco poison does not specifically damage a certain part of the human body, but destroys the function of human cells in an all-round way. If drugs to quit smoking cannot nourish the strength of cells throughout the body, but only correct a certain part alone, it is like driving a cloud ladder to take the moon. I want to quit tobacco poison, and the pain is heavy, and neurasthenia cannot be avoided!</p>
<p>According to my research over the years after graduating from Nantong Medical University, I believe that "Buti Kang" is the most suitable drug for quitting smoking. After taking it, it can restore the strength of cells throughout the body and increase the function of various tissues that have been lost due to tobacco poisoning. Therefore, once it is taken, the tobacco poison is cleared, the physical strength is active, the spirit is greatly increased, and there is no pain! After quitting, you will never re-smoke, because the efficacy of "Buti Kang" can completely eradicate the tobacco poison in the blood.</p>
<h3 id="e217">The Philosophy of Eating <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Wu Zhonglin</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang's short life vs. Grandma Liu's longevity</p>
<p>Everyone who has read the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Dream of the Red Chamber. They all know that Zhuge Liang's death was due to eating less and working more, while Grandma Liu was ridiculed by the young masters and ladies in Jia's mansion because she ate as much as an ox. You see, a resourceful Kongming is no match for Grandma Liu, who is as stupid as a deer, in terms of life. Isn't it strange? In fact, there is also a philosophy in eating. The reason why Kongming's appetite decreased was entirely due to overuse of the brain, which affected digestive function, resulting in insufficient nutrition and a weak and sickly body, so he naturally could not live long. And Grandma Liu eats good food and has nothing to do, and has nothing on her mind. So her appetite increased greatly. We certainly don't have to learn from Grandma Liu's character. But we ask for Grandma Liu's health. Then naturally, we cannot take the drug "Zhang Weijing" to make the appetite vigorous. Because this agent can transform the digestive function and promote the increase of appetite. Stomach stagnation, insufficient nutrition, stomach pain, vomiting, acid swallowing, fullness, and gas obstruction in the intestinal tract and farting like beads can all be cured. It can also supplement vitamin B and cure beriberi. In short, patients who have stomach and intestinal pain and loss of appetite due to overuse of the brain can take "Qiang Weijing". This is a special medicine that I have experienced after graduating from Nantong Medical University.</p>
<h3 id="e218">How to Replenish Lost Semen <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Song Zhongyu, Graduate of the Army Medical University</p>
<p>...Every young man who suffers from masturbation... Has symptoms of semen deficiency.</p>
<p>Semen is the most precious component in our lives. Without it, we cannot live. Without it, hundreds of diseases will occur. The most obvious is that young people aged fourteen or fifteen are tempted by the outside world; and stimulated by hormones, they develop the bad habit of masturbation. They lose semen without restriction. So, the morbid state appears every day. The most obvious is incomplete development and neurasthenia. Others can also get this result due to excessive sexual activity. Patients are mentally sluggish, anemic, and emaciated. This is because the body lacks endocrine nutrition. In terms of puberty glands, it is because the function is abnormal and cannot develop, and related sexual neurasthenia, such as nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, weak erection, etc., all arise because of this. Others, such as insomnia, palpitations, and memory, have obvious reductions.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of nocturnal emission caused by masturbation, etc., based on my decades of practical experience after graduating from the Army University, taking "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" is the most effective, because nocturnal emission is mostly due to weak sexual nerves and the loss of control of the sperm lock, so the sperm is often involuntarily lost. "Nairis Nocturnal Emission Tablets" can just suppress nerves and consolidate the sperm lock, and quickly and normally cure nocturnal emission. Compared with those dominant inferior drugs, there is a world of difference. This can be fully proved by people who have taken the medicine and been cured. Only those whose bodies are very weak. Can be taken with "Buti Kang". It is easier to work.</p>
<p>Reader's Corner</p>
<p>The following medicines are all designated by physicians who have graduated from domestic and foreign medical universities. Please make sure to recognize the names of the medicines when purchasing: Do not blindly believe in other people's words and purchase miscellaneous brands of inferior medicines, so as not to cause danger after taking them.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Bailin from Jiading asked: I suffered from gonorrhea because I visited brothels after drinking alcohol. Repeated treatments have failed. However, I have also had a bad habit of masturbation, so I suffer from gonorrhea and nocturnal emission at the same time, so my spirit is very depressed, and I have lost all hope. Please indicate an effective medicine and where it is sold!</p>
<p>(Answer) This is gonococcal disease combined with sexual weakness. You can take "Kelinong" to treat gonorrhea and "Buti Kang" to treat weakness. Both medicines are sold at Wing On Company.</p>

<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Beards, on the human body, also seem to be something related to appearance. For example, our Chairman Lin's silver beard fluttering, and Dean Yu's face full of thoughtfulness, all fully express their kind, gentle, dignified, and solemn expressions. No wonder some people think that a beard is a symbol of masculine beauty, and in some situations, it does indeed give people this feeling.</p>
<p>Therefore, beards are sometimes regarded as a tool. In the business world, "mature and prudent" is always more likely to gain people's trust than "frivolous and impetuous." Fortune-tellers often grow beards, also for this purpose. As for its style, it is indeed diverse, including "one," "eight," and "public" shapes, and it also changes with the times. It is said that people in friendly countries have a "Beard Club" because beards are also sufficient to express the tendency of their national spirit. The "one-shaped" beard of friendly countries looks somewhat brave, enterprising, and lively, which is by no means accidental. Chinese people grow beards mostly as they please, except for young people who are curious to try.</p>
<p>In old novels, we can often see various descriptions such as "three strands of clear beard" and "five strands of long beard," which are actually just like the white, black, grayish-white, and even red beards acted out in operas, connected into a triangle, to express the loyalty, treachery, bravery, and cowardice of the characters in the play, with the same intention. "Later generations look at today as today looks at the past, and people today are no different from people in the past." Beards are naturally no exception.</p>
<p>There are countless interesting anecdotes about beards in history. Recently, contemporary figures such as Xiong Fenghuang shaved his beard because of his marriage, and Chu Taiji shaved his beard to raise funds for disaster relief through amateur performances. One is about growing old and enjoying the pleasure of an affair, and the other is about being eager for public good and benefiting the poor. Their lingering influence is indeed enough to be remembered as a good story.</p>
<p>A local proverb says: "Nine out of ten pockmarked women are pretty, and nine out of ten bearded men are lecherous." The former refers to women and is only about their appearance from behind, while the latter is unknown why it bears this bad name. It is impossible to trace the original creator. Perhaps, bearded men often fail to win women's favor, so they inevitably vent their feelings through "lecherousness," just a joke.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Wild Chicken <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>"Wild chicken" is a kind of woman in Shanghai, a euphemism for lower-class prostitutes. Checking the definition of wild chicken, it is originally one of the fowl, the so-called "pheasant" that Zilu attacked and smelled three times before eating. Therefore, the name wild chicken is "pheasant prostitute." However, this is used in the writings of scholars. If we speak in a popular way, we always say "wild chicken." Why are these lower-class prostitutes called wild chickens? I am afraid that even if you search through the Twenty-Four Histories, you will not be able to find out the reason.</p>
<p>Although wild chicken is a euphemism for lower-class prostitutes, it is now widely used as an adjective in Shanghai. Anything abnormal or irregular is prefixed with wild chicken. For example, if you open a shop, there are always some regular customers who come to patronize. But in addition to these regular customers, if there are strangers who come to the door, these strangers are called "wild chicken customers." This is even more common in the cosmetic market. Those who rarely call for one or two sessions are called wild chicken customers. Those who occasionally go to the dance hall to buy a one-dollar dance ticket and dance are also a kind of wild chicken customer.</p>
<p>Before cars became popular in Shanghai, the most prominent were horse-drawn carriages. There are two types of horse-drawn carriages: privately owned and rental. At the same time, there is also a type that is nominally privately owned but actually rented out, which is called "wild chicken horse-drawn carriage," just like the current "wild chicken car." Although it pays the black license fee for a privately owned car, it is actually doing the rental business of a white license, its function is only to cater to the vanity of customers. Even more common is the "wild chicken rickshaw." It has the name of a private rickshaw, but the reality of a public rickshaw. When soliciting customers, it speaks in a low voice and takes fares, often sneaking into small alleys, furtively, fearing being found by the police and having its license revoked. However, when pulling customers on the street, the passengers sit high and majestic, who can see through that what they are sitting in is a wild chicken rickshaw?</p>
<p>Speaking of wild chicken, it always seems a bit undignified, and it doesn't seem to leak out from the mouths of adults and gentlemen. However, in recent years, the word wild chicken has gradually invaded the education sector. Look, there are quite a few people here who rent a two-story alley house and call themselves "wild chicken universities" to cultivate young people. In wild chicken universities, you only need to pay the tuition fee according to the regulations, and you don't need to attend classes every day. As long as you pass a considerable amount of time, you can actually wear a square hat. The funniest thing is that the professors who substitute for classes often say to people, unintentionally, "I am playing wild chicken." And the students always call this kind of professor "wild chicken teacher."</p>
<p>Wild chicken, in Shanghai, is all the rage, so our Shanghai is no less than a "wild chicken world."</p>
<h3 id="e222">About Catering <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Mei</p>
<p>Don't look down on a caterer - there is nothing in the world as difficult as eating. If there were no catering industry in society, then those "point kings" and "tycoons" in various institutions could sit in their chauffeured cars and return to their mansions for a leisurely feast; but how would those small clerks fill their stomachs! Don't look down on a caterer! It is not easy to be a head chef in an institution. Without connections, even if you are a culinary master, who will pay attention to you! Once you become a caterer, you must be sophisticated and handle things properly with tycoons, small clerks, and even workers; otherwise, watch out for your bowls and dishes!</p>
<p>Doing thousands of things, not doing loss-making things. Doing catering is no exception to this rule, but this is difficult to say. In the residence of the principal of a certain school, including the chauffeur and maid, there are more than ten people in total, but the catering only serves three and a half meals. The caterer already feels somewhat unspeakably embarrassed, and the embarrassment is not limited to this. When delivering meals to guests, the kitchen staff must first deliver them to the principal's residence, waiting for them to choose fish and meat, or even take food from other people's meals, to provide for the feast of those ten or more people. The caterer, constrained by the hierarchy, dares not say a "no" word, so he has to reduce the students' food to the point where it cannot be reduced anymore. The student union does not know about this, so the caterer is often punished with "reduced dishes"!</p>
<p>In some institutions, the accountant, the general affairs officer, and the head chef often jointly run the catering business. There are also accountants who are impartial and do not allow the pre-payment of meal fees. There are also general affairs officers who not only eat meals for free, but the caterer also has to prepare generous gifts during festivals to repay their kindness and care. The inside story of this is difficult to express in a word. It is often heard that head chefs escape halfway because they cannot withstand the heavy exploitation.</p>

<p>"It's no longer the luxurious Golden Changmen of the past!"</p>
<p>After we stepped on Changmen, which we had left for five years, the first sentence that burst out was such a sigh. The sparse crowd, combined with the yellow leaves rolled up by the autumn wind, felt the same desolation! The flashing neon lights, like a demon in the dark night, leaped with its teeth and claws! As if to swallow the entire Golden Changmen!</p>
<p>Before the opening of the Pingmen Gate, before the reconstruction of Hulong Street and Guanqian Street into broad avenues, Changmen was like a flower and jade maiden, with a constant stream of people coming and going. The singing that never stopped all night, who would have thought that it would be as haggard, old, and pitiful as the bleak autumn scenery.</p>
<p>Just taking a few circles, looking at the thousands of electric lights, as if to resist the authority of this dark night, the lights are more decorated with beautiful girls, no, it should be said pitiful women!</p>
<p>They drag on when they meet someone, "Let's have some fun! Sir!" Looking at their faces covered with thick white powder, and their lips added with deep red rouge, is it beautiful? I dare not say, my eyes only have pity! They are making a full of tactful, clear, delicate sounds calling out, but to me it sounds like a tragic cry from hell on earth.</p>
<p>Thinking of the singing and dancing five years ago, Changmen itself should also feel old!</p>

<p>Menglan suddenly blushed and could not answer. Youmei said: The question I asked is very abrupt. But I am doing it with good intentions. I complain that my learning is not as good as yours, so in literature, I cannot be your confidant. Suppose my learning is the same as yours, or even better, then I would definitely be able to comfort you. How to say it? The ten thousand points of grievances in your heart, someone in the universe knows. But since I can't do it, I think it is not difficult to find such a person in the universe. Tell me the truth, so that I can help you. In writing, is there anyone you admire in your heart? Menglan still held the fan on her face, looking at Youmei. Youmei said: In my life, all my private matters have been told to you, and you have told me mine. You don't think that my temperament has changed and that I am no longer your close friend. Why do you have to suffocate all your suffering in your heart? It would be good to spit out ten points to me. Menglan thought for a long time, suddenly stood up, walked to him, held his hand and said: Mei, save me. With just this sentence, his voice hardened, and two lines of tears flowed, breaking the shallow powder marks on his cheeks and dripping onto his clothes. Youmei immediately stood up, patted his shoulder, and held his hand back, sincerely saying: Just say it, if I can save you, I will definitely save you. Menglan shook her head and said: My heart is messed up, I just feel that I can't say it for a while. Youmei pulled him to sit on the rattan chair, sat slightly leaning on the chair, took out a handkerchief from his body, gently pressed on his eyes, and whispered: Don't be sad. We women who are born in this transitional era are always inevitably sacrificed. But people are not grass and trees, who can be emotionless? If we can avoid being sacrificed, wouldn't it be better? Menglan waited for the tears to dry. Only then did she say: I think, I can't hide this matter from you. And my elder brother also knows about this matter, can you help me? Youmei said: This is the end of it, it can be seen that what I said that I can help you will never be an empty word. Tell me slowly, Menglan said: You probably know a few points, otherwise, you wouldn't come to me and ask me like this. Yesterday I went to find you, you were not at home, I thought that this matter would be known to you. It's not that I didn't tell you, such a good friend, it's really because I regret it very much, I want to escape this heavy net. Saying that, she quietly sighed. (94)</p>

<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>The charming autumn sun is coquettishly spreading over the grassland, as if carrying a bit of early spring flavor; the wind, like a pair of amorous young woman's slender hands, surrounded my neck and probed into my chest, making me feel endless comfort and lightness.</p>
<p>A group of three people got off the bus at Yunzao Creek and walked along the river bank. Silently, everyone was temporarily silent, letting the soles of their shoes rub against the fine stones, making a crisp pace, rhythmically rippling in the quiet air, rippling. Rumble rumble! A small train flew past us, and the two rails left behind stretched in front of us like two ink lines, all the way to the horizon, to the end of the sea, and to the end of the world.</p>
<p>After passing the foreign bridge, the river was densely packed with many cargo ships and square-headed boats. On the shore, you could also see some untidy people and scattered small stalls; a group of children were sitting around on the muddy ground talking about something. Everyone was holding a small paper flag in their hands, looking a bit like they were holding a meeting. Rong went to a stall to buy some fruits and snacks, thinking about going to the river to find a cleaner boat, ready to swim the river once, but after walking a lot of the river bank, the few boats that were seen were too unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>"Boat! Boat! Want to swim the river!" Several hoarse voices were ringing in the river, so we turned our heads to look at the place where the sound was ringing, and saw several old women standing on the boat beckoning to us.</p>
<p>"That's not a boat girl, it's simply a boat old woman," Rong said with a humorous tone. Ling was feeling disappointed. She went forward without saying a word. However, I also followed them aimlessly, to see what kind of miracle they would discover today! At this time, I was like a philosopher, using my attitude of questioning life to observe everything in the world, everything in nature. At the same time, I was also like a psychologist, using my keen nerves to carefully analyze the thoughts and psychology of the two of them.</p>
<p>We ate and talked in the cabin, forgetting the pain of reality, forgetting the terror of the world's major crisis breaking out, only enjoying the momentary comfort in front of us, "stealing half a day of leisure," in this half day we traced the past, experienced the present, and looked forward to the future. Although everything in the past was too disappointing, everything in the present was very vague, and everything in the future was even more frightening to think about. However, we can treat these as a nightmare. At this moment, we may as well look for a little spiritual comfort outside the scope of the dream to make up for the defects in our hearts. Because of that, we should protect our pure souls and never let them be damaged in the slightest.</p>
<p>The flowing waves were calmly flowing, and the white clouds in the sky were quietly flying. A slanting sun, several stacks of rosy clouds, the wind blew the willow threads to dance, and the oars struck the water to create subtle ripples; ah! What a quiet and beautiful painting! However, we do not know whether we are the people in the painting, or the painting in front of us? Even we ourselves are a bit at a loss.</p>

<h3 id="e227">The Popularity of "Wang Baochuan" <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ci</p>
<p>Women in China are like a special kind of person. If they cannot ascend to heaven, they must fall into hell. Those who ascend to heaven are of course accompanied by their husbands to dance halls and movie theaters; while those who enter hell are mostly doing the work of horses and cows, or living as widows. Heaven is not something that everyone can ascend to, and hell is not something that most people are willing to enter, so those who are caught in the middle have to try their best to maintain their in-between position.</p>
<p>But maintaining it is very difficult, take economics as an example, needless to say, it must be independent, and economic independence, naturally, you have to find a job, if you have a job, then you use the results of your service to exchange for corresponding rewards. Some places even have organizations such as the Women's Social Service Promotion Association for this purpose.</p>
<p>The women's circles in Beiping have such activities.</p>
<p>We live in Shanghai, so of course we have no way of knowing the results of their activities, but from the news published in the newspapers alone, we can also know one or two things, such as preparing to hold a grand amusement fair at the Beijing Hotel, staging old operas and spoken dramas, and deciding to perform the English drama "Wang Baochuan," and asking Ms. Yu Shan to play the lead role.</p>
<p>What arouses our interest in this news is naturally "Wang Baochuan," but it is not because "Wang Baochuan" is an English drama, and when this drama was staged in London, it caused a sensation among the British royal family to visit it. What we feel a little strange is that a group like the Women's Social Service Promotion Association would perform "Wang Baochuan."</p>
<p>Here, we must first explain the reason why "Wang Baochuan" is successful.</p>
<p>Foreigners' welcome of Chinese operas is not worthy of saying artistic appreciation, it is only the impulse of curiosity. The dramas they usually see are mostly realistic, such as the scenery striving for splendor, the actions striving for realism, and for the sake of urgent life, the expression of the theme is often the most urgent part of life. Now they see the symbolic method of using a horse whip as a horse to ride, and they see the joys and sorrows of Wang Baochuan and Xue Pinggui, which lasts for twenty years. So leisurely, so romantic, they naturally can't help but cheer!</p>
<p>But what do we appreciate "Wang Baochuan" for? And what is the purpose of a group like the Women's Social Service Promotion Association staging "Wang Baochuan"?</p>
<p>Is a figure like Wang Baochuan still an idol worshiped in the minds of modern women? Although it is said that marrying a poor scholar with the status of a prime minister's daughter shows that love does not distinguish between classes, and Pinggui's departure to join the army lasted for eighteen years, Wang Sanniang's suffering in a cold kiln for eighteen years, with her heart as still as water, also shows her steadfastness in love. But such love is not worth emulating.</p>
<p>Wang Baochuan is ultimately a product of feudal society. In Wang Baochuan's era, if a married woman could not live as a widow like Wang Baochuan, she would be subjected to the contempt of all people in society. If she was born in modern times, even in places where feudal forces still remain, because of the progress of the times, the environment would not allow such a figure to exist.</p>
<p>Because, this is beyond human nature.</p>
<p>Then, the Women's Social Service Promotion Association's performance of Wang Baochuan, we can only see that they are intentionally or unintentionally worshiping this figure; we can't think of any other significance. In the 1940s China, some people regarded amateur actors playing Nora as a regression. In fact, Nora should still be shown to Chinese women more often in Chinese society. Otherwise, those women who are stuck in the middle may be crushed to death!</p>

<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>——Selection from Haiyan</p>
<p>I love the coast of the South China Sea, where the ocean's waters spread out, covered broadly with silver-like brilliance. This is a fertile expanse formed by fish and shrimp. Three years ago, I traveled and lodged there. The impression remains deeply etched in my mind. Now, we are revisiting the old place. It was a hazy morning, the third day since we arrived in Taicheng from Guangzhou. I blankly boarded a cloud-piercing long-distance bus, my beautiful, appreciative eyes gazing at the snake-like stretching mountains, the lofty, cloud-inserted peaks, the ancient and serene villages hidden under green forests, and the clear stream waters. Although I haven't slept well due to the travel of the past three or four days, Annie still widened her two clever eyes, watching the captivating scenery from the window. She is accustomed to city life, and once she saw these magnificent mountains and rivers, her heart lightly fluttered. This reminded me of when I was in Jiangnan, looking from the train carriage and seeing an endless plain, dense green grass, everywhere showing a soft and elegant demeanor. But near the South China Sea, it displayed towering, magnificent mountain scenery. Perhaps the local customs and conditions of the South China Sea and Jiangnan differ due to the environment of geography and climate.</p>
<p>After a rapid two-and-a-half-hour long-distance bus ride, we arrived in Shenjing. This is the boundary where Kaiping and Yangjiang meet, and also a corner of Haiyan. However, Haiyan is a remote place with vast land, wealthy people, picturesque mountains, and clear waters. Using this place to represent it is insufficient. Many years ago, when bandit gangs occupied Gudou Mountain, Haiyan was disturbed by these gangs. This Shenjing also served as a bandit den for a long time. Thinking back to those years, how frightening it was! Now, peeking at the outlines of those simple country folk, it seems that their local characteristics are very barbaric. This remote乡 with inconvenient transportation also reveals a more primitive style of people.</p>
<p>To Haiyan Street—our destination—there were still more than fifty li of mountain road to cross. My legs could originally run, but unfortunately, I have been suffering from a foot ailment for three or four months. Annie probably can't walk much either, plus there's luggage. So, Lao He called three sedan chairs, each costing two yuan and fifty jiao in silver. After the price was negotiated, the dozen or so sedan chair bearers scrambled for the job, even tearing my rattan trunk. Although running back and forth on a hundred li of mountain road costs a lot of blood and sweat to earn this little money, in the countryside, this amount is not small. So, the sedan chair bearer who couldn't get the job widened his angry eyes, and a breath of disappointment oozed out.</p>
<p>Sitting in a sedan chair was a first for both Annie and me. In the past, in my imagination, before there were cars, sitting in a sedan chair was certainly a privilege for noble gentlemen, so it must be very interesting. But when it came to us trying it, the bitterness felt was hard to bear. Of course, I am not a narrow humanitarian, but I sympathize with the suffering of these laborers. When I saw that the skin on the shoulders of the sedan chair bearer in front of me was calloused and even broken, with sweat dripping down, struggling to wind through the rugged and narrow mountain road, or the winding and difficult paths, my heart clenched up as if something was pressing on it. At the same time, I wasn't used to sitting in a sedan chair. The solid wooden seat and the up-and-down motion soon made my buttocks sore and uncomfortable. I couldn't catch my breath, and my lungs seemed to be dancing, like a prisoner being tortured. I cursed: Why am I doing this? The slave in front is suffering even more than me! Thinking about it, the beautiful mountains and rivers, the enchanting scenery, I no longer had the heart to appreciate it.</p>
<p>When the sedan chair reached Shasha Pass, we got out and walked because this mountain road was the most dangerous and difficult to travel. Seeing the waterfalls and deep streams from the mountain was also heart-stirring. Annie, on the other hand, kept exclaiming how beautiful it was. This was once the big mountain where huge bandits occupied, and the lovely scenery was captivating enough. It also reminded me of visiting Tianzhu Mountain in Hangzhou. This place can also be compared to the magnificence of Nine Streams and Eighteen Gullies. It's a pity that Annie hasn't been to Hangzhou, so she probably doesn't feel that bit of similarity. From now on, Annie will also be living that kind of wandering life. Perhaps, one day, she will have more sweet and bitter experiences.</p>
<p>When the sedan chair reached Wencun, it was almost dusk. There were still nine li of Pingyang road to go. The two sedan chair bearers of Lao He ran particularly slowly. At that time, wind and rain suddenly came. When we arrived at Haiyan Street, it was completely dark. The pale yellow electric lights were flickering. From the time we left in the morning until now, the difficult journey of one hundred and fifty li had emptied our stomachs.</p>
<p>But Haiyan Street—still cherished in my dreams—the kingdom of the sea, my father quietly threw himself into her embrace.</p>

<h3 id="e229">Returning Sails at Sea <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Lisi</p>
<p>"The setting sun shines on the red returning sails, drifting on the distant sea; oh, bring my beloved one back safe and sound!..."</p>
<p>Every time such a song rises on the seashore, Louisa, with her beautiful hair flowing, bare feet, and chest held high against the wind, stands on the granite, waiting for someone with ardent expectation—</p>
<p>This person is Gomi.</p>
<p>Gomi is now spreading his unusually strong arms, standing on the bow, with the setting sun, about to sink into the sea, behind him. Under the reflection of the setting sun, he has a bronze complexion and prominent muscles. "Strong Gomi," who on the island doesn't praise him like that? And Louisa, when she is held by Gomi's powerful arms and walks past every household's door on the island, she feels extraordinarily proud! Gomi naturally loves this rough, yet very beautiful, stimulating Louisa: the thought that he is about to meet this wild girl makes his heart blossom with joy.</p>
<p>However, as the ship gets closer to the coast, the women's chorus becomes even crisper in Gomi's ears; as he listens, his face gradually sinks.</p>
<p>"............</p>
<p>Tomorrow we will get married, and he will never go to sea again.</p>
<p>As the wind blows straight into Gomi's heart, a melancholy color flies onto the brow of this strong man—</p>
<p>--Tomorrow we will get married? Yes, Louisa, I have promised you that, saying that this time I come back, I will definitely not go to sea again. But, Louisa, that is still our young people's dream! I didn't get pearls and corals at sea, just brought back a boat of fish. These fish are the shipowner's, what else can I get besides my salary? And what will I use to marry you, Louisa?</p>
<p>On this side, Louisa, who is so excited that she is about to burst, has already left the granite-paved pier and run barefoot to the beach. She is singing along with the melodious song, opening her beautiful eyes wide, and stretching out her right hand to wave at the sails, waving, waving...</p>
<p>--Tomorrow we are really getting married, Gomi! When you went out to sea, didn't you hold my hand tightly and tell me that this time when you come back, we will have a comfortable home? Yes, I am eager to have a home! Gomi, I am really dying of anxiety!</p>
<p>The ship is closer, the sun only leaves a line of golden afterglow, sinking its head into the sea. People are calling each other's relatives' names, the voice of the white-haired old grandmother is even sharper, calling:</p>
<p>"Peter, my good grandson, you are--finally--back safe!"</p>
<p>Then she saw Peter rushing down from Gomi's side and throwing himself into her arms. Gomi also temporarily forgot his depression, and found Louisa standing on the side waiting for him. Like a pair of lovers who haven't seen each other for twenty-five years, they hugged tightly. They were both unable to say a word because of excessive excitement! After a long time, Louisa raised her head from Gomi's hairy chest, and said to him with a smile:</p>
<p>"Gomi, let's get married."</p>
<p>"Um--yes, Louisa--we--oh, I'm really happy!"</p>
<p>In the evening, Gomi drank in the hotel until midnight.</p>
<p>The next day, Gomi signed his name again at the shipowner's place, and Gomi's name was still on the list for the next sailing.</p>
<p>Louisa broke down in tears in his arms.</p>
<p>--This is forced by life, Louisa, it's not that I want to leave you... Let me go one more time, I will be back in a few days. Louisa, I won't cheat you... Ugh, why are you always crying? I don't want you--to cry!"</p>
<p>"Why not cry? Gomi, you're leaving again!"</p>
<p>Yes, on a bright morning at the end of October, Gomi and a fleet of sailing ships sailed out of this island again to develop their destiny. As for Louisa, she is waiting, eagerly waiting for the song to float up again on this lonely coast--</p>
<p>"The setting sun shines on the red returning sails, drifting on the distant sea! Oh, bring my lover back safe and sound!..."</p>
<h3 id="e230">The Old Registrar <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Mu Ye</p>
<p>I don't know why, when calling the roll, his eyes, looking out from his old-fashioned nearsighted glasses, were always a little blurred, as if a layer of fog separated them. Those young people, shaking blurry shadows in the classroom, he couldn't distinguish who was male and female, nor could he distinguish anyone's face. The face of each person reflected in his eyes was just a yellow-orange blur, and nothing else existed.</p>
<p>He was deeply troubled by this matter, and he cursed himself—why were his eyes so useless, like a blind man? So, in order to be more "dutiful," he held a large roll book, walked to each desk, and then called out each name one by one, and then laboriously marked an "×" with a pencil. So, he had to walk to every table, door to door. Sometimes there was no one in the seat, but he still walked over. When he found that there was no one there, he was buried in a burst of loud laughter.</p>
<p>In this ×× vocational school, he was the oldest in terms of age. It is said that he had a very good "reputation" decades ago, which was naturally his golden age. However, since the "change of dynasty" that he hated the most, he became outdated, to the point that he is now in the position of registrar with the lowest salary among all the teachers and staff in the school, only twenty yuan per month... Whenever he mentioned the past, apart from sighing, he would scold this "present world" until it was completely riddled with defects.</p>
<p>The reason why he was able to work as a registrar in this vocational school was because of his relationship with Principal Liu. He was a fellow villager and had the same surname as the principal. Twenty yuan a month was already a generous courtesy. So, some people rumored (?) that he was the principal's paternal uncle, but no one went into it too deeply.</p>
<p>He was only in charge of calling the roll. He had to call the roll in a dozen classrooms. If the number of students was less, he was also responsible for finding them. Whether it was in the schoolyard or in the dormitory, he had to search everywhere. What a troublesome thing! He thought of what it was like when he taught in a private school. The students were all well-behaved, unlike these young people who were so impetuous, understanding nothing but love between men and women! But what use were these students to him? So, he thought of the principal again. He knew that the principal collected dozens of yuan in tuition for each additional student. In principle, he was determined to: the more the better, and to reject none who came. So, this made him suffer. He repeatedly suggested to the principal that he give the students three laws (the first being "Be on time to enter the classroom"). The principal only listened with his left ear and let it out of his right. He knew that if it was so strict, it would be detrimental to the income.</p>
<p>"Bring the roll book!" Maybe at some point, the principal would be in the mood and want to care about "school affairs," then the old registrar would tremblingly bring the stack of roll books over.</p>
<p>"Too derelict, too derelict." Why are there so many ×'s? Huh? ...How can this work? Is it okay to always be absent? Tell you, I want you to go and call them one by one, but you always... always don't listen... I think you're full! ...Look at the book full of ×××, I ask you, do you think it looks good or not?" Then, with a "bang!" the principal threw the roll book down with force, and walked away angrily!</p>
<p>Here, he picked up the books one by one "...What do students do when they go to the classroom? The teacher doesn't even come, isn't it just a sloppy calculation? ...Anyway, the money is in hand..." He muttered these words in his stomach, --but didn't say them out loud!</p>
<p>As soon as the bell rang, his work began. Because he was not "full," he ran to every classroom, sweating profusely, holding a large stack of roll books, marking "/" signs. On the playground, in the dormitory, ... even in the toilet, he ran all over, as if begging every student who only liked to play and didn't want to go to the classroom:</p>
<p>"Sir, please go to the classroom, okay? My brother is responsible for calling the roll: otherwise, the principal will vent his anger on my brother. My brother is this year, this year, sixty years old, and there are two people in the family! Ugh, old and useless, if the principal gets angry, ... my brother will have to roll away, ... please sir, help me, isn't it the same to play in the classroom? Talk to female classmates (male classmates), or, bring a novel to flip through, right? ...As long as you, sir, are sitting in the classroom, it doesn't matter if you sleep! ...That way, you, sir, are always "present"; then, my brother can also mark an extra "/" on the roll book. This is a win-win, you, sir, will also look good, and my face will also be able to go down, so... this old man of such an age is really too difficult, you, sir, won't be able to bear it..."</p>
<p>He said what he always said, but he didn't care whether they listened or not.</p>
<p>Later, he finally discovered a good method, which was that whether you came or not, the roll book was a uniform "///"! The principal was naturally happy when he saw it.</p>
<h3 id="e231">In the Plains <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Ying</p>
<p>Every first and fifteenth of the month, the owner of this manor in the plains would gather all the skilled horsemen and hold a grand horse race, relying on his ample money and his superb horsemanship to win the hearts and beliefs of the masses. However, the manor owner's painstaking efforts always amounted to nothing; watching the trophy being snatched away by a less outstanding old man, the masses supported him in general, and the daughters dressed in red and green called "Old Man" before and after in a delicate voice. Thus, the manor owner was abandoned in a corner of dim solitude by all the people in the venue. In the aftermath of disappointment and embarrassment, he would always prop his chin with his hand, gnash his teeth, and ponder with a pair of rat-like eyes, as if plotting some sinister revenge against the old man.</p>
<p>However, the old man did not believe that there was any sinister or despicable consciousness in this world. He did not even believe that the famous and profitable manor owner would harm him. Whenever people warned him, he would always be so indifferent, shaking his head and saying, "Don't be defensive, I have never seen the things you said in my life!"</p>
<p>So, people stopped warning him. One day, two days,... the matter of the manor owner plotting against the old man also gradually faded from people's memories. The old man also lived peacefully, and people could see the old man and his horse at all times. Suddenly, one day the old man and his horse disappeared. No one saw the old man and his horse all day long. The news immediately spread throughout the entire village. Everyone ran out of their houses in panic, but the manor owner hid quietly in his house. Everyone believed that the old man and his horse had been murdered. So, people drove their horses in different directions to look for the old man in the plains.</p>
<p>It was very late at night before people found the old man. The moonlight in the plains was bleak and tearful. The old man sat on the ground, his head drooping, his hands holding his knees. His beloved horse lay beside him, already dead, with blood flowing all over the ground. At a glance, it was clear that he had been killed. Everyone was choked up and unable to say a word.</p>
<p>Finally, the old man stood up, slowly walked to the side of the horse, trembling, took the whip from the horse's body, carried it on his shoulder, bent over and walked away without saying a word. The old man probably realized that this world had changed a lot, right? (End)</p>

<p>The female actor Mei Luo Xiang has been staying in this strangely beautiful Gulangyu hotel for a long time. Just as she was planning to return to Shanghai, the major shareholder of the Shanghai Mingxin Stage came all the way to pick her up. Bai Senqing, who is in his forties, of course has his own purpose in caring for a young Mei Luo Xiang so much.</p>
<p>Bai Senqing was confident that this decisive plan had a 100% success rate. When he told Luo Xiang that he had already rented a house on Lafayette Road in the Shanghai French Concession, Mei Luo Xiang unexpectedly told him innocently that she had fallen in love with a passionate and loyal young man named Ma Ziying in this poetic Gulangyu.</p>
<p>Bai Senqing is a very worldly businessman. He understood that he could not defeat the handsome Ma Ziying with his own age; but when he learned that Ma Ziying was an editor at a newspaper and only earned fifty yuan a month, how could he support a luxurious Mei Luo Xiang, he told Mei Luo Xiang. What ironic words.</p>
<p>"We are both young, we can work hard." Mei Luo Xiang bravely answered him.</p>
<p>Ma Ziying came, and he saw Bai Senqing in Mei Luo Xiang's room. Of course, he clearly understood his past relationship with her, and he also knew that Mei Luo Xiang had married a husband five years ago who had now committed suicide; however, he didn't care at all, just like he himself had spent a decadent life of extravagance and handed it over to many unscrupulous women. As long as they both repent now, neither of them will care about those past deeds.</p>
<p>However, he now demanded that Luo Xiang not be accompanied to Shanghai by people like Bai Senqing. No, perhaps this was a command.</p>
<p>Mei Luo Xiang was, of course, absolutely obedient; they had arranged it well: when Ma Ziying could earn more salary, he would definitely go to Shanghai to pick up Mei Luo Xiang back to Gulangyu.</p>
<p>But what about that Bai Senqing? ...</p>

<p>The elegant anecdotes of Jingzhao are many. Long days in the boudoir are all spent. He is drawing eyebrow styles in morning makeup, discussing. It takes a lot of effort to draw and grind ten hu of pearls. Colorful brushes inscribe poems, both tubes are bright. The urging makeup is beautifully rhymed. There is more ink left on the inkstone, dipped in a goat's hair brush. Want to draw that, crescent moon bay, what do you mean. Ask the husband if the depth is the latest style. It's more than doubling the eyebrow spectrum of double moths. There are those, moon-edged shadows that turn new styles. There are those, light eyebrows that are pale to nothing. There are those, willow leaves that can be compared. There are those, new mole points on the eyebrow chart. Then take that, colorful phoenix bronze mirror to look back. Carefully trace the eyebrows with intention. Shoulder to shoulder pushing sleeves to paint at dawn. Under the green gauze window, comb your head even more. At first, I didn't expect the spring light to leak and hear great words. The romantic anecdotes spread the harmony of husband and wife? Go sing the wife's follow of the good match.

<p>The wind is favorable and the rain is smooth, celebrating prosperity. The Tang Ming Emperor is, I like beauty, the side is falling to the city. The harem powder has no color. Only, Consort Mei's talent and appearance are outstanding. Eyebrows like willow. Hair like clouds. Beautiful face is born with beauty. The romantic emperor is favored. Flowers and shadows under the moon, morning and dusk together. It is truly, the affection is lingering like the sea is deep. Who knows, covering the sleeves to work to slander the woman of the Yang family. Newly selected eyebrows enter the palace gate. Competing for favor and love, the jealousy is deep. Fox charm can confuse the supreme. From then on, the drums and flutes in the courtyard are noisy, I am truly desolate and lonely in the courtyard. Autumn water wants to wear the horse does not come. Love new joy. Forget the old man. Men have always been ungrateful. The fan is donated before the autumn wind rises. Cry badly, how many beautiful women in the world. Consort Mei is, thinking alone, the intestines are broken. Only the wax candle has the heart to drop tears until dawn. Not long after, the Hu rebel rebels and ascends the golden palace. Originally for that hundred charms and thousand smiles Yang Taizhen. The storm is fierce and the rain is urging. The beautiful woman broke her soul. End to leave that, fragrant bones are buried in the plum forest.</p>

I entrust you, don't be tired. You flutter all night, filling up the roads for travelers. Teaching the alleys and streets to be deserted of people. Have you firmly remembered? My friends, so many footprints go north, south, east, and west. Leaving traces in the snow. Have you carefully observed, recognized the marks? So many streets and alleys, where should one search? The north wind howls. Snowflakes flutter. The north wind howls, a layer of sorrow envelops. Snowflakes flutter, a burst of desolation twines. Let my heart follow the snowflakes. Falling and shattering coldly. Let my song blend with the north wind. Howling fiercely.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Hua'an's publicity draft stated that Fei Mu's new work, "The Bloody Battle of Wolf Mountain," was scheduled to premiere simultaneously at the Carlton and Xinguang theaters on the 7th. However, it has not been edited well as of today (the 3rd). Perhaps a few shots still need to be reshot temporarily, so it is impossible to catch up on the 7th. Taking its place is Yi Hua's "The Treasure Map."</p>
<p>This large-scale set piece film "has a very serious meaning," and the dog star "Pelli" also participates in the performance.</p>
<p>The Star Company's premiere will be held publicly on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>It is said that Hu Ping from A Tang will play the lead role in the amateur dramatists' "Sai Jinhua."</p>
<p>It is rumored that Mr. Huang Tianshi has joined Hua'an as a publicist.</p>
<p>Zuo Ming's new work after "Mr. Wang's Adventures" is "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," and the script has been sent to Beijing for inspection.</p>
<p>The seventh issue of Star Bi-Monthly has been published, and the cover is Tan Ying, "Little Lingzi." The articles include Lin Zhen's "Popular and Vulgar," Li Yi's "Highbrow and Few Followers," and others such as: In Memory of the Cultural Giant Lu Xun, Yang Falcon's translation of "Modern Times" Re-evaluation, Ji Ren's translation of "The Minghuang Company in the Eyes of the Japanese, Hollywood Claws," and in terms of theory, there is Tang Na's "Local Color and 'Air' in Film Scripts" Su Ling's "The Road to Art Films," etc. In addition to the half-month comics, there are also works by Huang Yao, Jiang Lindongliang, Yi Wenjie, Liang Sheng, etc. The sales price is still six cents.</p>
<h3 id="e237">A Scene from "Night Meeting" <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>

<h3 id="e238">"Motherly Love" <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The film co-starring Lin Chuchu and Li Keng, mother and son, had "Humanity" in the twenty-second year of the Republic, "Life" in the twenty-third year, and "Family Ethics" in the twenty-fourth year. These three dramas not only caused a sensation in society when they were performed, but also consecutively won the top spot for domestic films in these three years. Now, in the twenty-fifth year, the director of Minxin Company, Jin Qingzi, specially wrote the script for "Motherly Love" and invited Lin Chuchu and Li Keng to co-star, and specially invited Ge Zuozhi and seven other stars to co-star. It is undoubtedly the championship film of the twenty-fifth year.</p>
<p>The entire film is immersed in clean emotions and great motherly love, writing about a mother who has been abandoned by her husband, sacrificing everything from her youth to her death to protect her son's life, raise him to adulthood, and cultivate his future. She would rather suffer from the oppression of life, live a lonely life, do hard work, and spend countless energy. Although she is exhausted, she finally achieves her ultimate goal and gets the final comfort.</p>
<p>Especially the amazing performances of Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, and Ge Zuozhi have surpassed their previous achievements. The efforts of the director, supporting actors, and Fang staff have produced the unprecedented harvest of "Motherly Love," which is especially worth mentioning.</p>
