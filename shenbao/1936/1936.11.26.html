<h3>中日問題的基本認識（中）　—讀山崎靖純先生排日的中國以後—</h3>
<p>— 周憲文</p>
<p>關於中國政府能否澈底與帝國主義一戰的問題，在山崎先生所碰到的許多中國朝野名流間，祗有『中國高爾基』魯迅先生有過明白的答復，他除毅然决然對這問題加以否定外，並謂：『至於中國幾時可由帝國主義而得解放，這我是一悲觀論者。那恐怕是在中國變成沙漠之時，那恐怕是在中國國民實行所謂饑餓戰術之時，但此時業已逼近，戈壁的沙漠已經逐漸南下，阿拉伯的沙漠亦巳逐漸東移：』。魯迅先生的意見，當然足以代表一方面；不過，我如果沒有誤解山崎先生的眞意，則其第一問題所暗示於我們的，是呌中國人不要前門拒虎，後門進狼；不要在反對日本帝國主義的熱在之下，引進了英美帝國主義的勢力，而至噬臍莫及。所以他說：歐美對於中國表示好意，其根本動機仍不出於會本主義的，商業的打算……假使他們眞的能够進而帮助中國，則在那時，他們內在的强烈的帝國主義的野心：亦將露骨的發揮，於是中國又非碰到很大的困難不可……』。對此問題，在原則上，我可同意。我會爲某刊物，寫過一篇雜感，題爲買辦與聽差；開頭就說，資本主義發展至帝國主義的階段，必然要向外國尋求殖民地，日本帝國主義固然要使中國爲其殖民地化，而英美帝國主義亦未能例外。不過「戲法人人會變，各人巧妙不同」，雖說因爲日本的自然環境與經濟條件使然，但畢竟日本帝國主義對付中國的辦法，不及英美來得巧妙。英美人之視中國人，有如買辦，日本人之視中國人，則無異聽差。買辦與聽差雖同爲其主人服役，但一則祗須大體遵守主人的吩咐，則一舉一動都須唯主人之命是從。常言道：「人向高走水向低」，棄聽差而爲買辦，少數奴隸性成的中國人，或所不免，但大多數重人格的中國人，决不作貿辦與聽差的比較，而願以鐵與血來掙脫一切帝國主義的束縛。關於道一點，山崎先生似乎可以不必担憂。</p>
<p>不過，中國人民以鐵與血來掙脫一切帝國主義的束縛是一事，而在日本帝國主義壓迫過甚的時候，集中所有的力量先與日本作一殊死的戰爭，把其他帝國主義暫時　過又是一事。當然，這劉其他帝國主義暫時放過」，結果弄得不好，可以形成「前鬥拒虎，後鬥進狼」的局面，但是這種局面的形成，决非由於中國人民的願意，而爲「實逼處此，無可奈何」。因爲前門的老虎，旣比後門的豺狼兇狠，則在本身無力　拒虎狼的時候，與其坐而待斃，不如先向比較兇狠的老虎反抗，或有一綫生機。縱使結果仍不免死於豺狼之手，仍成了豺狼的食料，但這决不是對於豺狼有所偏愛，對於老虎有所偏憎；質直言之，這决不是中國人願做英美帝國主義的買辦而不願做日本帝國主義的聽差。關於這一點，山崎先生似乎應該注意。</p>
<p>其次，卽山崎先生的第二問題，是謂：中國民衆抗日成功以後，究將如何建設？山崎先生於消極抗日的反面又提起了積極建設的問題。關於這問題，山峙先生並舉出許多理由，說中國要走資本主義國家的老路，已其决，卽山崎先生的第經『時代過去』：同樣的，我如果沒有誤解山崎先生的眞意，則其第二問題所暗示於我們的，是呌中國人注意抗日的結果：中國已經不能再走資本主義的老路，你們如果不想定蘇俄這條路，那末，你們對於目前的抗日，就得略爲愼重。不獨需要愼重，甚而目須進與日本携手。所以山崎先生說：『今後中國要用資本主義的方式，建立眞正近代的民族國家，已經時期太迥，中國的遵命，非與日本携手，以求生存，那就被蘇俄所支配；中國非於這兩條路中選擇一條不可』。對此問題，我的意見是如此。謂中國不能再走資本主義的老路，卽謂中國沒有資本主義的前途，道在整個資本主義危險萬狀的今日，明眼人自可同意：（大前提）就是現在政權在握的國民黨，其所信奉的三民主義　亦决無把中國引上資本主義道路的企圖。現任國民黨中央民衆訓練部長周佛海先生在其大著一民主義之理論的體系上，卽會反覆說明：「屬生主義的最後目的在打倒資本制度」。中園固然沒有贊本主義的前途，但試問日本資本中義的前途又在那裏？如果中日兩國完全站在平等的地位，那末以中國地面之廣，資源之富，不論就工業品的銷路或原料品的供給而言，萬一要說資本主義的前途（前提），都祗有比日本强，决沒有比日本壞。故如日本可以不向中國侵略，卽與中國完全站在平等的地位，而維持　資本主義的制度，則中國的資本主義固然沒有遠大的前途，但至少要比日本可以苟安一時。今以中國地面之廣資源之富，竟無法可與日本資本主義相與比善；而以日本地面之狹資源之貧，反可使其資本主義得以苟安殘喘：這事實告訴我們是中國替日本做了犧牲品。所以，如果要說資本主義沒有前途的話，那末，日本人自己應該首先另求出路。關於這一點，山崎先生似乎應該考慮。</p>

<h3>調節糧食與米麥分級檢定</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>日昨行政院通過實業等四部所擬之糧食調節暫行辦法仍許國內糧食自由流通各省市一律停止禁運至此後應吾禁止出口則須俟考察海關每月所報進出口數量以後認爲何種糧食有禁止出口之必要時再行核辦此外並規定由實業部　本局商同地方官廳就豐收區域運糧調節而運銷糧食之車輸運費亦酌予商减循是而行則糧價平準產銷接近不無有望也</p>
<p>惟欲解决整個之民食問題此特治標之一部分耳卽如辦理運銷倉儲而不於米麥分級問題得有解决之辦法則亦殊多困難先就倉儲言之農人所種之米或麥大都身骨不相同色澤不相勻顆粒不相等種類不相齊倘欲爲之各別儲藏非但多耗地位且於保管取贖徒增手續卽運銷之際包裝分儎以及扞樣出售亦平添不少麻煩故欲辦倉儲便運銷根本必需從米麥分級入手舍此不圖是猶不揣其本而齊其末可乎</p>
<p>米麥分級乃艱鉅之工作非可一蹴幾及往歲聞江蘇省爲圖農業倉庫事業進行之順利曾補助巨欵委託上海商品檢騐局就蘇省所產之小麥實行其分級之工作辦理一年始見成效今實業部旣以調節糧食爲己任農本局又以農倉運銷爲其主要之業務則於此項基本工作自宜儘先規劃進行吾人以爲此事應由實部撥給經費擴大組織搜集各區產品分別檢騐釐定等級而後倉儲運銷無虞扞格市塲流通亦有標凖之可循矣</p>
<p>不但如此卽稻麥品種之應如何改良劃一經過一番分級檢定之後亦有原則可資依據而品種改良畫一之結果後此分級檢定自必進行益便國內一般研究糧食問題者早知米麥分級檢定工作之重要故於八九年前卽已期望其實行今者蘇省旣有相當基礎則此後推行於各省自較有規範可循甚望實業當局早就此項問題定一切實周詳之辦法也</p>

<h3>內容包含三點</h3>
<p>（東京）據正式公布、德日兩國之反共協定、已於今日午刻在柏林簽字、該協定之內容、指出共產國際之目的、卽在謀現存各國之崩潰、吾人對於此稱干涉如加容忍、則不但共他各國之內部和平及社會幸福戚受危險、且使全世界之整個和平亦受威脅、故德日兩國願本合作之誠意、共同防禦此種共產主義謀使現存各國崩潰之陰謀、茲將雙方已商定之各點臚列於下、</p>

<h3>日外務省宣言</h3>
<p>日外務省亦發表宣言一種、聲稱共產國際成立以來、卽從事於種種使世界和平大受威脅之活動、去歲共產國際第七届大會時、曾議决與第二國際同組聯合陣綫、以反抗法西斯主義及帝國主義、並以德國·日本·及波蘭三國、爲其未來活動之目標、該大會更决定援助中國共產黨、俾與日本作戰、該宣言中、更提及最近西班牙事件、爲共產國際干預他國內務之鐵證、該宣言中、又謂遠東共產活動、包括中日兩國、而中國本部亦已受共產軍之蹂躪矣、「滿洲國」今亦有共產國際之活動、反共產國際之任何行動、必須根據國際合作、日德兩國對於共產國際、現處同樣之環境、爰特締結本協定、惟本恊定之目的、僅在共同防禦共產國際、日政府現願與儘多之列强合作、以完成防禦共產國際威脅之一切計劃、本協定之宗旨、卽在此一端也、本協定背後並無任何他種協定、蓋日政府不欲成立或參加任伺特別國際集團也、再本協定非對付蘇俄或其他任何一國者云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>德方解釋</h3>
<p>（柏林）外交部情報局長波蒂徹、頃以德日兩國所成立之「反共產國際」恊定全文、出示各外國新聞記者、幷稱、「協定原文至爲明顯、無須加以解釋、其目標乃在拯救歐洲文化、溯第三國際第七屆大會前於去年八月間開會時、卽已討論各種切實計畫、用以改造西班牙爲蘇維埃共和國、幷在其他各國樹立入民陣綫、于以見第三國際已向世界各國公開官戰、抑德國國社黨反對共產之所爲、並非新穎事實、觀於西班牙內戰慘酷已極、乃知時機迫切、不容再事躊躇、必待世界輿論一齊喚起之後、始乃有所舉動」、各國新聞記者嗣乃叩以此項協定、係由駐英大使里賓特羅浦簽字、其故安在、波蒂徹答稱、里賓特羅浦與布爾希維克主義相鬭爭、雖與共他德國人相同、但曾奉命主持此項談判云、（二十五日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>談判經過</h3>
<p>德日兩國關於成立反「共產國際」恊定一事、進行談判已非一日、迄至本年夏間、德國駐日大使陀西返國述職、並在貝許特斯伽登城與元首希特勒航空部長戈林將軍曁駐英大使里賓特羅浦反覆討論之後、始乃具體化、當時里賓特羅浦雖曾以此項協定對於歐洲政局、殊多不便爲言、但談判工作、大部份仍由里氏主持進行，而由外部英國事務司司長魯梅襄助其事、厥後並回意政府試探意見、但該國對於此種具體協定、無意加入、因而醞釀多時之反共協定、乃僅由德日兩國舉行簽字云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國新聞社　發表聲明　對華維持親善</h3>
<p>滬德國新聞社由德國官方駐華機關、得來對於日德恊定之說明如下、此項宣布並非同盟、抑或軍事協定、蓋該協定只關於該兩國也、且該協定以成立對於他國之內政完全不干涉、所以該恊定可說爲一種警備步驟、或兩國內治政策可也、該協定並不影響他國主權以及一切、中國各報章所論該協定之影響於中國者完全不確、蓋該協定並不危害中國主權以及其他權柄、德國對華從來採用親善政策、並且此後繼續親善、德國自知此項對日恊定、完全反共卽第三國際成立、中國對此、不必具任何項疑問、蓋中國亦正在收其剿匪之功效、</p>
<h3>英法輿論　反對反共十字軍</h3>
<p>（倫敦）德日兩國「反共協定」成立之後、此間政界人士並未加以評論、但因德國方面簽字者、卽係駐英大使里賓特羅浦其人、加之里氏日昨返國之際、並未通知英政府謂將參預其事、因而極爲驚異、政界人士失望之餘、幷因德日兩國談判不久、卽已成立此項協定、亦深爲詫異、此外負責人士逆料、英國各報對於「反共產十字軍」之組織、必將軍起反對、卽與論方面對於里賓特羅浦參預此事、亦將激烈加以反對云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德日兩國反共協定成立之後、此間外交界人士並不表示驚異、但謂此事關係重大、値得從長研究、此在政界人士則謂此項恊定、僅可適用於內政問題、至法國輿論對於此種思想上之十字軍自必極力加以反對云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德日兩國成立反『共產國際』協定、並决定設立常任聯席委員會之後、此間政界人士頃加以評論、以爲日本政府政治思想素稱賢明、他日必不致捲入歐洲漩渦、但吾人對於此項聯席委員會所可進行之工作、仍不能不深用疑慮云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄報觀察　日德利害衝突點</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）「莫斯科新聞」社論云、「希特勒組織所謂反布爾希維克集團之企圖、因德意及德日協定之締結、已開始實現於國際間、德意及日本外交政策之唯一推動力、乃絕頂恣蹤的民族主義與沙凡主義、侵略他國以擴大領土、乃至夢想支配全世界「此所謂反共主義之口號、實爲自欺欺人之假面具、吾人不欲過分誇張德意協定之重要性、齊亞諾柏林之行、並未能限制或甚至减輕德意間極深之隔閡、芸至於齊亞諾離德之决日、德代表在私入談話中、卽聲明彼等仍無時無刻不鄙視意大利、而與其妥協、乃因必須使英國發生印象之故、然苟能從英國取得報償、德國當願立卽唾棄其新的同盟以爲交換也云、自然、意大利亦曾以同樣言詞吿諸英國、</p>
<p>「德國利益與日本亦無共同點、德國對日貿易異常輕微、而中國則爲德貨極佳之市塲、且德工業已日益儘量加以利用、德國深知中國如完全屈服於日本、則此市塲卽將喪失、同時德國之要求殖民地心理、固隨時不忘日本委任統治各島、由此、日德恊定目的之一、當亦爲恐嚇英國、而連合德意及日本者、乃無共同的積極的而僅有共同的消極目的、蓋此三國特有之共同點、乃在各自均以侵略及武力價張爲目的、從而彼等對於國聯對於集體安全組織之反對態度、遂趨一致、</p>
<p>「於是否人乃見此公開侵略之三法西斯國家、以反對和平並反對一切保障和平者爲目的之集團、卽或組織尙未完全成功、希特勒曾屢决攻擊同盟及集團制度、聲稱彼僅願與隣邦締結雙面公約、然渠現在實際則與並非隣國之國家結成集團、彼之口號之虛僞性質、已重由彼自之揭破矣、</p>
<p>「西歐外交拾取希特勒之唾餘、亦曾聲稱反對集團制度、現希特勒已自組集團、並以實現侵略計畫爲目的矣、諸外交家其仍將反對和平國家之聯合乎、國際的和平組織是否能與國際侵略組織對抗、將於此後數月內觀之、」（二十五日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>德勸誘英　參加反共　英政府對之冷淡</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據今日「每日電報」載稱、首相包爾溫曾向德國駐、英大使里賓特羅浦稱、德俄兩國如斷絕外交關係、將使歐洲和平感受嚴重之影響、里氏當吿首相、謂蘇俄如將德國工程師斯蒂克林執行死刑、則德國卽將與蘇俄絕交、並向首相探詢英國能否參加德日反共協定、首相當拒絕予以考慮、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於德俄兩國關係惡化之說、日來甚囂塵上、消息靈通人士頃宣稱、德國大使里賓特羅浦。蘇俄大使邁斯基。最近與外務部人員談話時、均未提及此層、負責人士並謂、里賓特羅浦日昨晋謁首相鮑爾溫時、殆已深知英國政府對於德俄兩國斷絕外交關係之舉、頗小贊成、卽對於德國政府殫精竭慮、欲以主義上之問題影響於國際問題、亦不以爲然、里賓特洛浦本日飛返德國、其將以此項印象報吿本國政府、當無疑義云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國態度　保持絕對的中立</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關於德日兩國成立反共產協定一事、此間政界人士所得印象、以爲兩國締結同盟條約、美國旣無從加以反對、故願保持絕對的中立態度、大抵協定目標、一面在包圍蘇聯、一面則表示若有與德國爲敵者、日本卽當在遠東方面出而干涉、俾爲聲援、觀於德日兩國參謀部人員合作無間、德國幷允協助日本發展空軍、足見此項協定、業巳發生實效、此在美國對於任何戰爭危機、不惜任何代價、務欲推行孤立政策、藉免牽入漩渦、故其對於德日兩國成立協定之舉、自不致出而干涉也、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄當局　續捕德僑　兩國邦交惡化</h3>
<p>（柏林）被控在西比利亞礦區作搗亂舉動之德籍工程師史蒂克林經蘇俄法庭判處死刑後俄德兩國邦交、卽瀕於破裂、茲復聞蘇俄當局於星期六日續捕德僑三人、於是德國反俄之情感、更形激昂、此項消息、係德國官方通訊社駐莫斯科之訪員來電所述、電文甚短、僅舉被捕三人之姓氏、一爲工程師波斯赫爾茲、餘二人爲興德與史泰墨爾、聞德國駐俄大使署頃正詳探此項消息、（廿五日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於蘇聯法庭前將德國工程師斯蒂格林判處死刑一事、此間晨報頃載稱、蘇俄共產黨政治部、對於執行死刑、抑或予以特赦兩層意見尙未一致、重工業委員長奧卓尼基茲、交通委員長加迦諾維區等、以爲蘇俄法律、對於外國僑民與本國人民、無分軒輊　一律適用、故宜執法如山、不稍顧忌外交委員長李維諾夫、亦贊同此項主張、以爲德國縱使採取報復手段、亦唯施諸德國境內之蘇俄僑民而已、但人民委員會主席莫洛托夫、軍事委員長伏洛希路夫、及外交副委員長克勒丁斯基等、則以爲德俄兩國關係、不當使之愈益惡化、兩派意見、歧異如此、卽共產黨總書記史丹林亦無從加以决定、外傳此事須由會同蘇維埃代表大會（今日開會）表决云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄新憲法　通過蘇維埃大會</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇維埃黨全聯大會今日舉行特別會議、通過蘇聯新憲法、該憲法係由史丹林屬稿、助以顧問委員會、惟經數月來二十五萬入開會討論之結果、中執委會近曾通過修正文一三·七二一條、涉及多章並若干條文、豫料其最後稿可獲一致之贊同、新憲法規定民治選舉並黨治、故將選舉總統一人、設參衆兩院、均用不記名直接投票選舉之、農民與城鎭之勞工同享選舉權、憲法中承認工作爲每一公民之基本權利、並將承認公民權與財產權、參院議員定二百人、衆院定六百人、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>日俄軍又起衝突　日偽軍越境俄提抗議</h3>
<p>（長春）二十四日午后三時半、日本軍的四十名、在東部蘇滿邊境但力以北的三十二基羅「滿洲國領內、與有迫擊砲之蘇聯兵四十名發生衝突、雙方損害、其他詳情不明、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄外部因日一滿」軍隊又有侵犯蘇俄邊境之行動、已於今日向日本駐俄大使館提出嚴重抗議、據蘇俄致日大使之照會內稱、昨日下午五時有日「滿」軍隊五十餘名、在俄「滿」交界第二十號界石附近越過邊境、侵入蘇俄領士的半哩許、並向蘇俄邊界守兵開槍射擊、惟旋卽經守兵强迫彼等退去云、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>地中海風雲日緊　英國艦隊調動　保護商船航運安全　意軍在西屬島築防</h3>
<p>（倫敦）駐地中海英艦隊中之第一潛艇隊、計潛艇九艘與潛艇給養艦「賽埃克洛浦斯」號、由瑪爾太駛出後、今日外間盛傳駐地中海英軍艦之佈置、將有重要變更云云、英海軍部卽發表聲明、謂「賽埃克洛浦斯」號之起椗、僅爲循行常例、前往阿里康特替代英艦「胡爾維樞」號、今並無任何英潛艇開往西班牙海面、此說之起、或因有數潛艇偕同「賽埃克洛浦斯」號離港出外操練所致、此項潛艇仍將駛回原泊之處云、惟瑪爾太之英海軍將士現皆不許請假、今晚本擬舉行海軍攀術游藝會、欵待駛游該港之士耳其軍艦將士、亦臨時取銷、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍部今日雖稱、目前海軍調動爲「例行瓜代性質」、然外間頗多懸測、以爲對於西班牙局勢不無關係、有力方面則以爲此與外相艾登月稱保護英國商船必有關係、至於調動之計劃、則爲巡艦「加拉底號與驅逐艦九艘、定於星期四開赴瑪爾泰、以便替代現在柏爾馬之巡艦「亞利士薩」號及現在西班牙海岸一帶之驅逐艦九艘、潛艇「賽埃克洛浦斯」號則將於今晚先行駛往瑪爾泰、同時蘇俄駐英大使梅斯基曾與艾登唔談良久、據悉所談者卽爲西班牙叛軍封鎖地中海一事、此間盛傳史丹林已考慮以海軍保護蘇俄商船云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）關於法國船舶在西班牙沿海一帶之保護問題、負責方面頃官稱、法政府所採立場、與英國完全相同、易詞言之、即法國船舶凡在西班牙領海內者、（離西國海岸三英里之內）自當按照國際海洋法所規定辦法、受當地官廳之管轄、但在領海以外、則西國內戰當事雙方旣未被承認爲交戰團體、法國船舶自當不受儉查云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）自西班牙內亂爆發之後、外傳意國軍隊業在地中海西屬巴列牙爾羣島登陸、並構築防禦工事、關於此層、巴黎迥聲報駐倫敦訪員頃官稱、意相墨索里尼昨令駐英大使格蘭第通知英國政府、謂「共產主義在加泰隆自治邦設置前哨根據地之可能性（按卽加泰降邦成立蘇維埃共和國之謂）一日存在、意國卽當一日以巴列牙爾羣島某某數處地方爲根據地、而嚴重警戒、但一俟西國國民軍確定勝利之後、卽當毅然放棄、則以意國若果賡續加以保持、勢必在地中海上不斷引起種種紛爭故也」云云、巴黎迥聲報訪員推沒意國用意、謂西國內戰結果、勝利若果屬諸政府軍、則意國卽有良好口實、可在巴列牙爾羣島盤據不去、而置法國於不顧矣、意國外交當局刻正力勸英國政府、謂英國係以援助西國國民軍政府爲有利云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外傳蘇俄擬以軍艦護送西班牙領海中商船、此間對於此項消息、頗爲注意、蘇俄如實行此舉、或將被認爲向意德挑戰、同時據悉意德二國已準備公開干涉西班牙內戰、此間對於德國援助叛軍認爲極端嚴重、意德二國趕運軍火之說、亦使局勢益增不安、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國與南斯拉夫　進行借欵談判　擬在亞德里海岸　建造大規模軍港</h3>
<p>（維也納）今日據此間可靠消息、南斯拉夫已與英國進行四十萬萬提那借欵談判、俾在亞德里亞海岸建造極大海軍根據地、據悉如有意外事伴發生、英國海軍亦可使用該根據地、南斯拉夫執政保羅親王、不久且有赴倫敦親自接洽之說云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>西班牙叛軍　黑夜砲轟京城　大學區巷戰劇烈　官軍反攻佔優勢</h3>
<p>瑪德里昨晚復有砲彈多枚落於京城中心區、死數頗衆、法國聖路易敎堂亦在被毁之列、此項夜轟、大使居民震慄、因城中燈火現已滅至絕少數、在此黑暗中、時聞爆炸之聲、令人心膽俱碎也、大學城區兩軍時作巷戰、法國橋與舊日亞王私苑加薩特爾康波亦然、據官方宣稱、戰事利於政府軍云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>瑪德里國民軍所屬砲隊、本月向本城繼續轟擊、至午後七時始停、西郊「法蘭西人」橋與大學區一帶戰事、仍在進行中、政府軍舉行反攻頗爲得手、其所屬國際縱隊（卽各國左派人士所組織之義勇隊）已將西郊醫院予以圍困、院內現由國民軍二千員名負嵎固守、此外、加薩特岡巴公園一、帶、政府軍亦曾重創國民軍云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外傳一月之前、西班牙政府曾派潛艇一艘、巡戈於海峽一帶、不料至今未返本隊、或已加入國民軍方面云云、目下倫敦外交界人士亦有此種測度、懷疑日前襲擊政府巡洋艦「塞爾凡特斯」號之潛艇、或係西政府海軍中之逃艦、因此上項傳聞、益有可信之理由、西政府宣稱該巡艦已受重創之說、亦已由英驅逐艦「格羅華姆」號來電證實、因該英艦曾目擊「塞爾凡特斯」號艦上發生巨大之爆裂、艦身傾斜、不得不拖入港內修理也、據西政府方面之意見、以爲襲擊「塞爾凡特斯號者、係屬某外國之潛艇、間接卽指意德、因此已引起意德兩國之正式否認矣、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>叛軍艦隊　封基雄港　瑙船運軍火被扣</h3>
<p>加那里島戴納里夫港此間國民軍廣播消息稱、「巴塞洛那港外昨有瑙威商船一艘、載運軍火接濟政府軍、當被國民軍軍艦所扣留、此外並有希臘船一艘亦載有大批軍火、當被國民軍軍艦勒令駛往北菲洲西屬摩洛哥休達港、（在國民軍手中）目前國民軍艦隊業將西北部基雄港（在亞斯都利省境內）實行封鎖、預料旦夕間將對巴塞洛那曁伐朗西亞兩港進攻」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據塞維爾無綫電臺今日廣播消息稱、西班牙叛軍已在巴塞洛那港外、擊沈外國商船數艘、今後仍將阻出外國船隻開入港口云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>西京德使署　搜獲軍火　德僑被迫離城</h3>
<p>瑪德里此間民團今日在德國大使館搜獲手溜彈三箱、步槍機關槍手槍數枝、並逮捕數十人、多係西班牙難民、外交部旋卽照會德國大使館稱、德意兩國雖已承認叛軍政府、但兩國僑民現仍留駐瑪德里大使館、彼等應於二十四小時內出境、使館房屋此後卽當永久封鎖云、（二十四日國民電）</p>

<h3>劃中立區建議　被西政府拒絕</h3>
<p>伐倫西亞國際紅十字會近曾向西國內戰當事雙方提議、在瑪德里城內劃出中立地帶、由雙方保證其安全、外長特爾伐育頃致電瑪德里國防委會主席米亞伽將軍加以拒絕、謂「劃出中立地帶之議、政府若果准予照辦、不啻承認叛軍在該地帶以外轟炸平民、係屬合法之舉、是烏乎可」云云、（廿四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>汎美和平會　同情西國政府</h3>

<p>特載我國桐油出口貿易之展望（續）  君　　楬國桐油運銷各國之數量、以美德法等輸入我國之桐油為最多、年來皆有增加之傾向、我國桐油運銷於美國者、民國二十一年為二九九、八五〇公担、二十二年則增為五三一、六七一分担、廿三四兩年之數量雖有减少、但其原因並非美國需要减少、實因我國產量不足所致、　　又我桐油運銷於德國者、其增加速率更大、如廿一年時僅有一一、六九四公担、及至廿三年時數、其運銷法國之數額、增加率更比德國為大、如在二十一年時、僅為一〇、四五〇公担、二十二年則增至二二、四五三公担、卽已增加一倍有奇、及至廿三年、則更增至三一、八四九公担、已三倍於廿一年之數矣、　　在我國桐油運銷各主要國中、僅英荷兩國數量有减少之傾向、蓋此兩國種植產油植物農民之排外思想、及保富士康性之養成、均足以妨碍我國桐油之人口也、然此亦不足為悲觀之根據、因我國桐油輸往香港之數目、年來均呈增加之傾向、如廿一年為車輪戰九、八二六公担、至廿四年則激增至八七、四八一公担、其中尚有大部分係運至英國者、故英國桐油之消費量、實並未有减少之趨勢也、　　茲將近數年來我國桐油運銷各主要國之數量及其價格、列表於后、以示各國桐油需要量增加之情况、　　桐油具有數種為他種油類所不及之特質、（一）乾燥速、（二）體質輕、（三）槳力大、（四）能防腐、故可用為製油漆、日可渝飾汽車·房壁·飛機·船艦·軍械等等、吾人茍欲知各國桐油需要之多寡、可於各國汽車業·軍需工業·及房屋建造業等方面觀察之、若各國對於以上各種生產、皆有所增加、則桐油之需要、亦必增加、否則勢必减少、兩者係互為因果、祇須知此卽可推悉桐油出口之前途、　　茲先就美德英法各國汽車之生產而論、則其產額年來均有增加之趨勢、如以一九二九年為基數（等於一〇〇）、則各國汽車生產指數有如下表、（註三）　　一九三一　四四·四　五一·三　九三·九　八三·〇　　一九三二　二五·九　三一·四　一〇三·〇　六五·一　　一九三三　三五·六　六五·五　一一三·七　七一·一　　一九三四　五一·一　一〇一·九　一四七·二　六九·〇　　一九三五　七一·一　一四九·四　一七三·〇　六一·三　　一九三六　　一月　八二·二　一五三·五　二〇九·五　六五·一　　二月　六七·四　一六一·一　一七二·九　六八·六　　三月　八〇·七　一七六·二　二五四·一　七〇·八　　四月　九一·五　一九三·一　二〇二·三　七〇·八　　五月　八七·四　二〇五·八　二二九·三　七〇·六　　六月　八七·四　一九一·〇　一九五·三　六四·七　　一九三一年後、世界經濟轉趨繁榮、故其生產指數又開始增加、　　美國汽車工業現時已有增加之傾向、故其需用桐油量、亦必趨向增加之途、他如英德汽車工業、更突飛猛晋、法國汽車工業雖不甚發達、但年來亦呈增加之勢、由此可以預料桐油在各國汽車工業上之用途、將必有增加之可能、　　又歐美各國、年來均竭力重整軍備、蓋一方可藉此以鞏固國防、同時他方又可藉此以解决失業、及促進景氣之恢復、至各國軍需工業之進展如何、此則可從各近數年來之軍費預算中探求之、　（未完）巿價　　金巿　　金業交易所　　一月份　（標金）（單位元）　　上午開盤最低二五五·〇　　最高一一五六·六又　一一五五·七　　又　一一五六·四又　一一五五·八　　午收一一五·九　　十二月份登賬　一一五四·〇　　一月份登賬　一一五六·〇　　上午補水　一一五三·〇　　銀樓首飾金　　大同行兌出每兩一百二十元五角　　收進每兩一百十四元五角匯兌　　中央銀行掛牌　　倫　大條即期二十便士九三七五　　又　遠期二十便士九三七五　　紐約銀價　四角五分一二五　　純金每盎斯　　英　七鎊一先令十便士五　　美　三十五金元　　上海標準標金一一五三元七〇　　關金　二元二角八分九　　又合英金　卅三便士一八七五　　又合美金　六角七分六八七五　　倫敦電滙一先令二便士五　　以上國幣一元計算　　紐約電滙　三十元　　巴黎電滙　六百三十法郎　　柏林電滙　七十三金馬克五　　日本電滙　一百〇三元　　香港電滙　九十七元　　以上國幣百元了計算　　匯豐銀行掛牌　　先令　一先令二便士四六八七五　　美滙　七九元五角　　法滙　六百三十三法郎　　日本　一百〇三元二五　　德滙　七十二馬克七五　　香港　九十六元七五　　嗬囒　五十四福祿令　　印度　七十九羅比七五　　新加坡　五十一坡幣二五　　小呂宋　五十八元五　　銀錢巿　　利息　八分　　雙角暗盤　十一角七分九厘　　銅元暗盤　三百〇一千五百文證券　　華商證券　　上午第一盤收　第二盤收　　統一戊十二月期六二·六五　六二·三〇　　統一丁十二月期六三·六五　六三·四五　　統一丙十二月期六二·六〇　六二·四五　　統一乙十二月期六五·六五　六五·五五　　統一甲十二月期七〇·九五　七〇·九〇　　九六　十二月期　九·二〇　九·一〇　　下午第三盤收　第四盤收　　統一戊十二月期六二·二〇　六一·九〇　　統一丁十二月期六三·四〇　六三·三〇　　統一丙十二月期六二·五〇　六二·四〇　　統一乙十二月期六五·四〇　六五·三五　　統一甲十二月期七〇·八五　七〇·九〇　　九六　十二月期　九·一〇　九·一〇紗花　　華商紗巿　　前巿　後巿　　標準棉紗（反手二十支）金雞　　十二月期　　開盤　二三三·七　二三八·四　　二盤　二三六·〇　二三九·〇　　三盤　二三六·七　二三八·〇　　收盤　二三六·五　二三九·〇　　一月期　　開盤　二二五·六　二二九·八　　二盤　二二七·五　二二八·八　　三盤　二二七·四　二二八·八　　收盤　二二七·九　二三〇·三　　二月期　　開盤　二二二·五　二二二·五　　二盤　二二二·二　二二二·〇　　三盤　二二二·〇　二二二·七　　收盤　二二二·五　二二三·六　　標準棉花（國產細絨棉花紡）　　二十支棉紗原料為準）　　十二月期　　開盤　四一·〇〇　四一·三五　　二盤　四一·一五　四一·一〇　　三盤　四一·一〇　四一·一〇　　收盤　四一·〇〇　四一·一五　　一月期　　開盤　四一·五〇　四一·一五　　二盤　四一·六五　四一·六〇　　三盤　四一·四五　四一·六〇　　收盤　四一·五〇　四一·五五　　二月期　　開盤　四一·七五　四二·〇五　　二盤　四一·九五　四一·七五　　三盤　四一·七〇　四一·七五　　收盤　四一·七五　四一·七五　　三月期　　開盤　四二·〇五　四二·三〇　　二盤　四二·一五　四二·〇五　　三盤　四二·〇〇　四二·〇〇　　收盤　四二·一五　四二·〇五　　三品紗花　　紗巿　花巿　　十一月　二三〇·二〇　　十二月　二四九·三〇　十二月　六五·三〇　　一月　二四一·六〇　一月　六五·八五　　二月　二三四·四〇　二月　六六·〇〇　　三月　二二七·六〇　三月　六六·二〇　　四月　二二〇·七〇　四月　六六·三〇　　五月　二一八·〇〇　五月　六六·四〇　　現紗　　二十支　　好做　二九四·五〇　廣東　四〇　　三星　二五四·〇〇　又　二〇　　金城　二五五·〇〇　又　三〇　　又　二五七·〇〇　內地　三〇　　雙鹿　二五五·〇〇　長沙　五〇　　大發　二六四·〇〇　內地　一〇　　三星　二五六·〇〇　雲南　一六〇　　金雞　二六三·五〇　又　三〇　　雙鹿　二五六·五〇　長沙　二五　　雙鶴　二五九·〇〇　又　二〇　　採花　二五五·〇〇　四川　三〇　　紅三羊二五六·〇〇　內地　二　　四十二支　　人鐘　三七八·五〇　內地　五　　三十二支　　十全　三〇八·〇〇　長沙　五　　十七支　　九龍　二五一·〇〇　江西　一三五　　十六支　　好侶　二四六·〇〇　同行　四〇　　金城　二四六·〇〇　內地　五　　十支　　人鐘　二二〇·〇〇　徐州　二五　　織女　二二三·〇〇　江西　一〇　　金雞　二二七·五〇　雲南　四〇　　孔雀　二二二·〇〇　又　二〇　　六十支　　日光　四八九·〇〇　內地　五　　四十二支　　仙桃　三七九·〇〇　內地　一　　藍　　三八〇·〇〇　又　二　　四十支　　仙桃　三五六·〇〇　內地　三　　寶來　三六〇·〇〇　又　一　　三十二支　　宮女　三〇九·〇〇　長沙　二〇　　銀月　三〇八·〇〇　又　五　　藍　　三〇〇·〇〇　內地　二　　二十支　　立馬　二五六·〇〇　內地　三　　十六支　　月宮　二四六·〇〇　內地　二〇疋頭（大盤原件價目）　　粗布　每疋國幣　　十八磅賽馬　一一·五五〇　　十六磅五福　一〇·一〇〇　　十六磅雙象　九·九〇〇　　十六磅四平　　九·九五〇　　十五磅團龍　九·四五〇　　十四磅藍鷄　八·六〇〇　　十四磅藍鹿　八·六〇〇　　十三磅九天　八·一〇〇　　十三磅飛熊　八·一〇〇　　相汪磅三鹿　五·九〇〇　　十磅跳竄　六·三〇〇　　九磅內衣　六·二五〇　　粗斜　　十六磅五元寶　一〇·九五〇　　十六磅四平　　一一·〇〇〇　　十一磅貓鷹　七·一〇〇　　細布　　十三磅藍雙鷄　九·二〇〇　　十三磅雙龍　　九·八五〇　　十二磅龍頭　八·八五〇　　十二磅闖　　八·七五〇　　十二磅吉祥　八·六五〇　　細斜　　雙龍珠　八·八五〇　　闖鶴　八·九〇〇　　龍頭　八·九〇〇　　五福　八·九〇〇　　原布　　十磅跳舞　七·九五〇　　八四跳舞　五·七五〇　　漂布　　彩恒字　九·七五〇　　戚繼光　一〇·七五〇　　每碼價　　財神縐呢　〇·四二〇〇　　金鳳金鋼呢　〇·二五〇〇　　鴻　縐地呢　〇·三七五〇　　三羊嗶嘰　〇·二九五〇　　三羊直貫　〇·三三〇〇　　青島直貫　〇·三四〇〇　　青島嗶嘰　〇·三一玲玲　　青島縐呢　〇·三四〇〇　　龍燈金鋼呢　〇·四〇〇〇　　四喜元　綢　〇·五四五〇　　廠棧　　恊昌德　趙傑記　機尖　九·一〇　　和記榮記　機尖　九·二五　　又春　茂　又　九·二五　　以下雜糧公會　開之秈米　　江西機晚米一〇·八五　至一〇·三五　　又　機早米一遴一·四五　至　九·七五　　又　機元米一〇·四五　至一〇·〇〇　　又　機碎粞　八·八〇　　湖南　靖米一〇·一七　至一〇·〇五　　甬江機元米一一·五〇　　台州柳秈米一〇·七五　至一〇·五七　　江北機秈米一〇·〇〇　　碎石米巿廿五日　　平陳冬春　九六〇機中早尖　七二〇　　　新冬春　八一〇棧黃蘆尖　七五〇　　西頂壬尖　八九〇機黃靖江　六四〇　　機頂灑南　七九〇廠高壬尖　八五〇　　機頂蒸谷　八　〇特頂白粳　八五九　　機河灘尖　八〇〇特頂變元　九一〇　　機白廣尖　八〇〇機頂陰元　八三〇　　機頂早尖　七四五　　麵粉　　前巿　　十一月期　十二月期　　開盤　三·八四〇〇　三·八五七五　　收盤　三·八一〇〇　三·八二五〇　　一月期　二月期　　開盤　三·八七五〇　二·八九〇〇　　收盤　三·八四二五　三·八六五〇　　三月期　四月期　　開盤　三·九〇〇〇　三·九一七五　　收盤　三·八七七五　三·八九五〇　　後巿　　十一月期　十二月期　　開盤　三·八〇〇〇　三·八一五〇　　收盤　三·八〇〇〇　三·八二〇〇　　一月期　二月期　　開盤　三·八六〇〇　三·八八〇〇　　收盤　三·八五二五　二·八八七五　　三月期　四月期　　開盤　三·八九二五　三·九　三〇　　收盤　三·八八〇〇　三·八九〇〇　　雜糧交易所　　前巿　後巿　　標準小麥　　十一月期　　開盤　六·一一　六·〇七　　收盤　六·〇六　　十二月期　　開盤　六·二六　六·二〇　　收盤　六·二三　六·二〇　　一月期　　開盤　六·三八　六·三一　　收盤　六·三四　六·三一　　二月期　　開盤　六·四八　六·四三　　收盤　六·四五　六·四四　　三月期　　開盤　六·五五　六·五〇　　收盤　六·五三　六·五一　　四月期　　開盤　六·五九　六·五四　　收盤　六·五七　六·五五　　標準洋莊芝蔴英磅司碼制　　十一月期　　收盤　一二·六〇　　十二月期　　開盤　一二·七〇　　收盤　一二·六九　一二·六七　　標準豆油　　十一月期　　開盤　二〇·六五　二〇·八〇　　收盤　二〇·七五　二〇·九〇　　十二月期　　開盤　二〇·四〇　二〇·六〇　　收盤　二〇·六〇　二〇·七〇　　一月期　　開盤　二〇·二〇　二〇·二〇　　收盤　二〇·三五　　二月期　　開盤　二〇·一〇　二〇·一〇　　收盤　二〇·一〇　二〇·一〇　　三月期　　開盤　一九·九〇　一九·九五　　收盤　一九·九五　二〇·〇〇　　標準光邊豆餅

<p>通俗講座關天培將軍  蘇子涵　　前清道光年間，中國因爲禁抽大烟，兩廣總督林則徐把英國輪船運來的鴉片烟燒了，英國自然不答應，便派了一大隊兵船來攻打廣東。但是林則徐能守能戰，英國的兵船不但得不到勝仗，反被打得大敗。英國的兵將却也狡猾，知道把廣東奈何不得，打聽得浙江同直隸兩省都沒多好的準備，便揮兵去攻打這兩省。兩省的中國兵打敗了，地方也失了，皇帝同大臣們嚇得了不得，趕緊派員講和。於是把林則徐充軍，呌直隸總督琦善到廣東去。畸善這傢伙的才幹太差，遠趕不上林則徐，上了英兵的當，廣州終歸失掉了。好吧，再派員講和。英國人看準了中國的大臣們沒用，多方作難，才把和約訂好。香港就是在這回割給英國的。　　這便是近年來中國國恥中有名的「鴉片之戰」。　　別瞧琦善那傢伙沒用，但是廣東除了林則徐這忠臣之外，也還有好漢子。　　先是廣東水師提督李增階，因為防範太疏忽了，讓英國運鴉片烟的船，大搖大擺開到勞埔，被朝廷貶了官。跟著便調蘇松營總兵官關天培去做廣東水師提督。這關天培是江蘇山陽縣人氏，行伍出身，却也是一員好將。　　話說關天培到任過後，便親自出去，到處看相地勢，在要緊的地方，修起砲台，排起織索，弄得異常堅固。有閒睱的時候，不是著　海集，便是練習弓馬拳棍。　　禁烟事情發動過後，英國兵船來攻打廣東，林則徐同關天培同心合力的同英兵打仗，結果英兵退了。　　過後，關天培更把自己紥營的地方－虎門修築堅固，虎門外面列著的十座砲台，也加意把守。大角沙角這兩座砲台隔虎門最遠，也最重要。　　誰知道朝廷一心講和，把林則徐換了，徧徧接手的又是琦善這個沒用的傢伙。　　道光二十年十二月，英國兵船趁着林則徐離開廣東，又大隊的來攻打廣東，第一攻打的便是大角沙角兩座砲台。　　琦善只想同英兵講和，至少也想他們慢一點來攻打廣州天天天都派人送些公文去講和。英國人眞夠狡猾，也眞是把琦善看透了，他們一面也呌人回送些公文來，似乎是可以講和的樣子，一面仍然派兵攻打虎門外面的砲台，日裏夜里輪流攻打。　　那時駐紥廣州的旗兵同督　撫標的兵大概有萬多人，加上調來的別省救兵同團練鄉勇，一起也有好幾萬人了。但是琦善派去幫忙守十座砲台的只有撫標二百人，駐在東莞，提標二百人，預備接應。好像守砲台是水師的事情，同陸軍不相干。試問，這一點人夠做什麼？所以大角沙角兩座砲座經不住英國兵船的大砲攻打，終歸失陷了！　　像這一時又在講和，一時又在打仗，一直鬧到道光二十一年正月，十座砲台只剩下威遠靖遠兩座了，守兵也不過是幾百疲乏不堪的人馬。　　廣州的救兵不來，剩下的這幾百人馬濟得甚事？關天培無法，便呌　擊麥廷章到廣州去主救兵。　　麥廷章奉命，到了廣州，請見琦善，琦善到也接見了。麥廷章反　月來同英兵打仗的情形稟明過後，又稟道：「虎門外的十座砲台只剩下兩座了，兵又少又疲，再不派兵去救，眼見得這兩座砲台也守不住。虎門是廣州要緊的地方，沒有虎門就沒有廣州。大人派兵救住虎門，便算救了廣州，也算救了中國」。　　誰知琦善心迷住了，只知道講和，隨便麥廷章怎樣求，一百個不發兵便完了，麥廷章沒法，只好回去。　　關天培見麥廷章說琦善不發兵，不覺怒發沖冠，大罵琦善誤國。過了一會，氣平了，自己嘆息道：「大丈夫應該以死報國，現在事急了，我當然要死守砲台，台在我在，台亡我死，也顧不得家裏八十歲的老娘，同妻小兒子了」！又向麥廷章說：「現在眾寡不敵，有死而已。將軍，你可要自作打算」。　　麥廷章很從容的說：「大人能夠以死報國，難道部下就不能？要死大家死在一塊，大家死守國家這一塊疆土罷」！　　關天培聽了，不覺抓着麥廷章的手道！「麥將軍，你眞是關天培的好弟兄，好同志」！　　於是關天培同麥廷章集合敗殘人馬，死守着靖遠砲台。　　道光二十一年二月六日，英國兵船大舉進攻靖遠砲台，砲彈槍子如雨一般向台裏飛來。關天培牽着麥廷章在槍林彈雨裏督着兵卒應戰。從卯時打到未時，這幾百人馬已經死了大半，關天培本人也帶許多傷，衣服都流滿了血。他知道砲台守不住了，便呌他的長隨孫長慶走，說：「我負了守土責任，應該死的，你不過是一個長隨，何必同我一樣等死，去罷！把印給總督送去」。　　孫長慶不肯走，牽著關天培的衣服，大哭道：「奴才跟了主人幾十年，受了主人許多恩惠，要報答也報答不了。今天主人有了急難，奴才能夠昧着良心自顧逃生去嗎？要死死在一塊吧」！　　關天培聽了，大怒，拔出刀來，說：「我負了國家，負了父母，死是應該！你幹嗎不去？不去，便先殺你！」說着便把印丟給孫長慶，「這印是很重要的，你把印送到總督府去，便算報答我了」！　　孫長慶沒法，只好拿了印，一面哭一面跑下山去，等他才跑到半山腰，關天培已經倒在台上了。　　孫長慶好容易才把印送到總督府，也顧不得徧身的傷痕，馬上便跑回靖遠砲台去。等他跑攏的時候，砲台已經被英兵佔了，進不去。　　孫長慶在砲台的左右躲着，想着一個機會進砲台去。湊巧一個姓吳的通事在那裏閒逛，　吳通事也受過關天培的恩惠。孫長慶便把想進砲台去尋關天培的屍體的事哭訴一番，吳通事到底是中國人，聽了很受感動。又想借此報答關天培。便替孫長慶向守台的英將說了，英將也看重孫長慶的義氣，便允許他進去尋。　　兩個英兵押着孫長慶，在砲臺裏到處尋關天培的屍首，不見，過後走到關天培生前立着督戰的地方，翻天二三十個屍首，好容易才找着了，半邊身體已被砲火燒焦了。　　孫長慶一見屍首，便發昏過去，兩個英兵想法把他救了過來。又找。找了一陣，麥廷章的屍首也找着了，更慘，只剩了半個身子！　　屍首找到了，孫長慶自去弄錢買棺木，裝殮了，又費盡千辛萬苦，才送回家鄉葬了。　　正是！關麥忠臣，長慶義士，青史名標，河山正氣！　　二十五年十月於成都近世第一女傑　羅蘭夫人  林葉　　（續第三十四期）　　那年六月，被軟禁起來的路易十六，悄然遁走，復被捕，又重歸巴黎。羅蘭夫人瞻顧國內當時情勢，心裏十分難過，以爲僅有革命之名，實際上，並未實行革命。常常自己慨然嘆息說：「我希望國內再發生一次革命！但是，民衆究竟還有沒有這種力量呢！」過了些時候，便怏怏返裡昂了。歸途散放了許多羅伯士比的革命檄，想靠着檄文來激起大衆革命的情緒。　　不久，國會便解散了，又別開一立法議會來掌握國家政治。立法議會是由七百四十五個新議員組成的，羅蘭先生也是其中之一。　　在立法議會中，最佔勢力的是狄郎的士辰。都是由許多年少氣銳，志行高潔，有熾熱的愛國心，有光明遠大的理想的青年組成。狄郞的士辰的黨魁是羅蘭先生，實際上，訓練指揮這些人的羅蘭夫人。　　此時國家情勢益急了，內憂外患，紛至沓來。奄奄殘喘的路易十六，至此不得不罪斥誤國舊臣，而倚重民黨。羅蘭以興望所歸，被任爲內務大臣。這個新內務大臣，入謁內廷時，常常穿着平常的衣服，舊鞋，戴頂　帽，宮中待者都覺得十分驚異。　　羅蘭先生任內務大臣之後，羅蘭夫人的聲勢愈盛了。日間，她在私邸召集諸黨派，晚間剛鞠躬盡瘁，幫助羅蘭先生規劃種種事項。羅蘭先生每與其同僚有所計議，必請夫人列席。內務大臣公案上狼籍山積的重要文讀，一一必先經夫人手，以後再交付秘書官。凡提出議會的及閣議的報告書，都由夫人起草。使當時新政府的動力日趨於共和理想的，不是羅蘭，實在是羅蘭夫人。佩內務六臣金印的是羅蘭，但是大權却都在這紅顏宰相的手裏。　　羅蘭夫人覺着改革一國內政的大業，決不能夠信賴朝廷。她常常說：「別人信賴路易，我却不信他。我以爲生於專制時代下，憑專制的力量而被立為王的人，絕對不能夠行立憲政治。」　　羅蘭夫人日日驅使他的丈夫，驅使其他諸大臣，驅使狄朗的士全黨，與路易相遠。是年六月，新政府與路易王之衝突已達於極點。八月十日是，路易十六被囚到別殿，王政至此乃完全被推倒。　　王政推倒後，政權乃完全操於一般人民之手。這般人民，是飲了革命醉藥而發狂的一羣，暴虐恣睢，咆哮馳突，直正的共和正義，完全爲他們蹂躪破壞了。此時可以彈壓這一羣暴民的，只有昔日立法議會中山岳黨的首領丹頓一人。丹頓此時想率領自己的黨派與羅蘭夫婦領導的狄郎的士黨結爲同盟，好擴大自己勢力，但夫人堅決反對，以爲不拒絕這個同盟，以後狄朗的士黨的勢力便不能保持。丹頓初時十分渴望這個同盟的成立，天天都要到夫人家中的應接室去談洽此事。後來看着夫人態度堅決，明白這事不能成功，便對夫人由欽慕而變爲怨恨。羅蘭家中，再也不見他的蹤跡了。　　未幾，丹頓的山岳黨，便以血塗巴黎了。他們將巴黎獄中幽囚的王黨，完全屠殺。到此，夫人深深發現出他們猙獰殘暴的面貌。她在寫給朋友的信上說：「我們已居羅伯士比，馬拉的刀下了。我」「的友人丹頓實在是革命的公敵。他以羅伯士比爲傀儡，以馬拉爲羽翼，握短刀，持藥綫以刺爆國民。我的熱血革命，是你所知道的。但是現在我覺得革命是一件可恥的事情了。革命被無道的豎子沽污了！幾十年的努力經營，結果使國家淪落到這境界，我眞覺得難過。這也是革命黨的羞恥。」　　雖然時勢日非，但是羅蘭夫人的志氣並不稍挫，常常鼓舞她麾下諸豪傑說：「時至今日，我們雖然連自救的能力都沒有了，但是，我們此刻仍活着，便不能不想法救我們的國。」其時，狄朗的士黨人掌握政權的只有羅蘭和布里素，勢單力孤，提出來的意見，每每不被接納。　　一七三年，一月二十一日是，山岳黨將廢王路易十六送到斷頭臺上。不久他們又想把溫和共和派的狄朗的士黨的勢力完全刈除。即在此年五月的一夜，派了警吏去捕羅蘭夫婦。羅蘭先生先期聞訊逃脫了。羅蘭夫人被逮。她被補時毫不恐懼，用溫愛的言語安慰了啼泣的愛女之後。他們將她關在邊比獄中。　　夫人日日用書籍鮮花陪伴着自己度獄中歲月，毫不恐怖頺喪。還將自己袋中的金錢，完全散給貧囚，自己粗布惡食，也不以爲苦。　　在獄中被監禁了二十四日，忽接到放免的命令，她便與同獄囚人握的告別，驅車回家。誰知抵家之後，還沒有興家人談幾句話，便又有幾個警吏躡跡而來，從懷中取出逮捕的公文，又把夫人捕了去。這一次，却又換了一個監獄。　　夫人在獄中，英氣毫不少衰，仍然時時寫信鼓舞她的同志。她給她的朋友信上說：「我友呵！希望你不要灰心，仍舊努力下去。像布爾達士那種人，被放逐在腓列比之野，就嗒然嘆息說：『我不能再救羅馬了！』我是不佩服的。」她除了讀書自遣以外，更憑藉音樂抒發自己的情感。她向獄吏妻借了一張弦琴，時時彈奏，一彈三嘆，聽者無不動容。　　十月二十日，夫人自桑拉比獄移到康沙士黎獄。在此受鞠訊數次。最後公判的前一天，有一個律師來見夫人，自稱願意爲夫人辯護。夫人向他說：「我的命運已定，你不必爲我申辯了，免得使你自己生命也發生危險。」說完，脫下手上指環，贈給那律師表示謝忱。　　公判之日，夫人着雪白之衣，出現於法庭。她如波的眷顾鬈髮，澄明的碧眼與白衣相掩映；聖潔，高貴，望去如天上人。法官拿出種種僞證來誣陷她，她當堂慷慨陳詞，從容剖辯，毫無畏懼之色。她說：「狄郎的士黨的舉動，俯仰無愧於天地。眞正的大人物，去掉自己的私情私慾，以身獻給自己的國家同胞，並不稍悔。我今日靜待諸君宣告我的死刑。正人君子上斷頭臺時，也是他進凱旋門的時候。像這樣污濁混亂以人血爲酒漿的世界，我還戀它做什麼！我默祝我國國民，早得享受眞正的自由。」　　這一片熱誠摯切的言語，使那殺人不眨眼的法官聽了也不知所對了。最後，便隨意捏造了預聞陰謀，不利於共和政體的罪名，宣告夫人的死刑。　　是日下午，夫人回獄後，收攝萬慮，寫了幾封信寄給他的親友。在致牠愛女信的末句說：「你應該以你的雙親爲榜樣去修養你自己，那樣，才可以算不虛生於天地間。」　　第二天－－一七九三年十一月九日，羅蘭夫人便被載在囚車上，送到刑塲去了　　西洋有一通例是：凡男女同時受刑，女先男後，爲的是怕女的見了受戮者的慘狀恐懼戰慄。那天與羅蘭夫人同車來的男子，未到行刑時便戰慄無人色了。夫人見了他的樣子，十分可憐他，便說：「請你先而死罷！免得你見我流血的慘狀更驚恐。」說完，便請劊子手變更行刑的次序。夫人愛人議俠之心，是到不變的。　　夫人登上斷頭臺，猛見臺上龐大的神像，題名爲：「自由之神」，夫人近前一揖，慨然嘆道：「自由！自由！天下多少罪惡，假你之名以行！」如電之刀一揮，斷送了夫人四十一年壯快義烈的生涯！從此，夫人便脫離塵世，成爲歷史上的人物了　　夫人殉國後，她的一婢一僕自投法庭，請從夫人以死，這完全是由於夫人爲人寬厚仁愛，方能感人到這地步。通俗讀物編刊社啟事：　　本社新辨了一個「大衆

<p>時代醫藥刊夫婦智識  德國醫學博士張君實愛的最高峯是什麽？　　……性生活為結婚生活的核心也即是愛的最高峯　……要維持愛的頂點於不墜必先培養充足的性能　　一個故事或者一個劇本，中間情緒最緊張的地方四做頂點（就是最高峯）。如果沒有這種引人入勝的地方，看起來就鬆懈平淡，味如嚼蠟了，愛情的進展也是如此，會漸漸地達到最高峯，如果男和女在這最高峰上，彼此不能滿意，愛情一定會冷淡下去，以至消減的。　　那麼什麽是愛情的最高峯呢？許多人一定說是結婚。這答覆並不算錯，不過結婚只是一種儀式而已，我們還是直截痛快點，認定性生活為愛的最高峯，因為這是結婚生活的核心。　　在這愛的最高峯上，男女雙方要怎樣能成功呢？唯一的辦法是·培養充足健全的性機能。無庸掩飾地，性生活的中間，男和女各自追求著滿足自己先天的慾望，而這種慾望的滿足，必得對方的共鳴為前提。　　性能薄弱的青年男女便克儘其使命，不能和對方亢進的熱情相協調。許多男子患著陽痿，徒然熱情如火，終被　於性生活的大門外；不少的男子局部短小，或患早洩，當然要為女子所憎厭或輕視；另外又有身染白蜀的，愈沒有女子肯親近他了·女子中間也沒有類似的不幸者，性感淡薄，或竟鳥有，完全不能營愉快的性生活，做丈夫的自然不能滿足。　　身患此等疾病，在愛的最高峯上，必然立不住足。這都是手淫，徒慾等造成的惡果，阻礙了生殖腺的發育，破損了射精作用，因此，男子的患者，大致有遺精病的發生。　　怎樣去援助他們呢？最妥當的辦法是投以生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，本劑係提煉壯健動物生殖腺的精華製成，分男用女用二種。男用的能活陽萎早洩，發育不全，局部短小，能將萎弱無用的文弱男子，改造成性能健全的偉丈夫。但患有遺精病者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以鞏固精關，恢復對於射精的控制力。　　「女用生殖素」能根治女子的不感或冷感症，并可調整經期，促進發育，以求健美的姿態。至於淋病若為性生活的阻礙，宜急服用黃色素和伐克辛的合製劑「安敵淋」，女子如已受丈夫傳染，必須二人同服，方不至有死灰複燃的危機。　　（編者按：「生殖素」和「希米脫氏固精片」概裝鐵盒，市上偶見紙盒瓶裝者，均係為藥，購時必須認明鐵盒為要。）療養指導撲滅淋病的最新方法  美國本薛文尼大學醫學博士姚崇培　　淋病會給人視為不洽之症，這還是不久的事情。依我的目光觀察，淋病的難治，或甚至於不治，一半果然因病情複雜，易於蔓延；一半也出於病家的遲延和亂投雜藥。　　醫士們習用的注射洗條，手續瑣繁，病家已視為畏途，而應用時偶一部慎，即致流弊，使全功盡棄。這種療法的困難，確實使撲滅淋病的工作，加了許多困難。　　因此，服用使利而又功效確實的內服劑，遂為舉世所切望。許多以白櫻油為主劑的利尿鎮痛藥，只願一時之效的霸藥，紛紛出現，反使人們對於內服藥，生了種輕視的態度。　　可是德國傑特生博士卻深信內服劑必有成功的一日，範圍研究國傑然給他發明了黃色素與伐克辛的合製劑，定名為『安敵淋』。此種製劑具有偉大的殺菌抗毒的能力，已成為最新便利的撲滅淋病的方法。　　當傑特博士首次聲稱發明本劑時，大受一般醫生的嘲笑。他們都以為洽治療淋病，斷非內服藥所能濟事，認為傑氏在痴人說夢，這位發明家也不同他們從事口舌之爭，只努力地應用本劑，為人治病，不及一年，已治愈了五六千人，愈後絕不復發。這成績震動了整個的德國和歐洲，吸引了多報告都證明本劑之確實可靠，遂確立了新療法的地位。性的開明  詹念曾醫師最有效的矯正手淫法　　手淫過度後會什麽要遺精用怎樣的方法可以可以根治痊愈？　女子的手淫與男子的手淫所得的弊害孰重及其挽救法　　所謂手淫，就是一種不附隨生殖之目的的性與發散的形式；那是經由種種的方法，以刺激局部而耽貪於一種之愉快感覺的行為，男女犯者異當眾多。最多的比例，大約在十四歲至二十四歲的時期為最盛。關於手淫的誘因及其種種弊害，本刊裏有詳盡的敘述，本交之作，為欲將其矯正的方法，再貢獻一二，想亦讀者所歡迎也。　　矯正手淫，主要問題，必須清心寡慾，及培補其精力充足，則意志堅强，對於弊害之觀點亦清。但徒藉空言，每難收事半功倍之效。原因由於身體積弱的人，每不能從事於勞作業，而變為意惰，容易陷入幻想狀態。誤解性感的特殊興味，因此而啟示買的動機。故而除清淨其環境及實除一切不良的接觸之外，主要者須藥劑以挽救之。用尖銳的醫藥眼光觀察，惟有生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』可以增强精力，直接雖說為消除因手淫所引起的一切疾病，如精神衰弱症，早洩，陰萎，及局部發育不全等等的主要良藥，但間接能使手淫冬季的目的自動減弱。有一患者，在過去一時期，會耽溺手淫，一切弊害如耳鳴，頭痛，失眠，健忘等症產生，彼雖於戒絕手淫，然因身體過弱，不能產生堅强的控制力，結果，惡癖愈陷愈深，同時所染的疾病愈又加重的傾向，乃開始利用『生殖素』思消減其弊害，不料服後一星期，即感精神充足，睡眠安適，不時幻想一掃而空，結果不僅將劇烈的神經衰弱症治好，而手淫的戒絕也不若以前的困難，毫無留連而戒絕了惡癖。　　關於手淫之害，除上述的幾點之外，則遺精為其難以避免之症候，患者可服『希米脫氏固精片』以治之，每能立見功效，惟女性懼患手淫之後，能使月經不調，子宮障礙，宜服女用『生殖素』以調養月經，增强體力，解除子宮障礙，一般觀察，都認女子受手淫之害，不著男子得悲慘。戒煙常識我的戒煙經驗談　　編輯先生：　　說起來也心痛，我以三十三歲方壯之年，卻已和雅片結了六年的不解緣。以前都是為了一陳陳胃痛的難受，才聽人之勸，拿起了煙槍，起初效驗如神，私心窮喜。不料半年以後，搶丟不脫手了，胃痛也漸漸的發作了。　　少年時滿懷的抱負，朝氣勃勃的精神，充旺强盛的體力，不約而同地離我而去。從此我變得瘦削萎靡，暮氣沉沉得鬼也似的；器重我的師友們都為我歎息，并一致認為我已不堪救藥。　　愈想愈覺悔恨交加，千方百計地想跳出煙護城來。五六年中，戒過三次，都未戒成。空自痛苦得周身發虛，倒在床上亂滾，嘔吐噁心，涕泗橫流，雙目發白，氣息僅屬。失敗了三次，自以為此生休矣，也不敢再存非分之望，夢想還我自由的了　　今年春末，胃痛大發，適有友人李君，自滬上反鄉，謂胃病可服『胃痛雜』以止其痛，服『健胃素』以增胃鈉；至於戒煙，只須內服生殖腺素製藥『生殖素』。即能無痛戒絕。我見他說得容易，極感懷疑。他卻又調這幾種靈藥，在滬已卓著成效，並舉實例數則相示。我給他說動了心，便買了來服，不及二月，胃痛痊愈，煙癮斷絕，飯量增加，身體也日趨佳境。至今戒完方四個多月，舊日的原狀已完全恢復。（下略）　　蘇州周莊石　僅啟性病講座  詹念曾醫師編撰　　（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　門診上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。　　（一）　手淫遺精腦弱失眠　　患者曹佳承，年廿五歲，江蘇昆山人，職業糧食。（主訴）——十六歲來申學業，受同店劣友所誘，乃犯上手淫，耽溺頗烈頗烈。致精關與生殖腺間被摧殘，尚不思戒絕。結果，精枯腦弱，思考力銳減，始力自戒除，然已釀成遺精，夢洩，耳鳴，頭痛，心悸，盜漢，手足酸軟，精神疲憊等症，尤以失眠，健忘兩症最劇烈。故痛苦萬狀，肌肉削瘦，面容蒼白，直至今夏，始出其友陸季純君介紹，投余處求治。（診時病狀）——上述神經衰弱症極度劇烈，每星期至少遺精四次，神容萎黃，骨瘦如柴，入夜有盜汗，時為夫眠症所苦。自盡頭昏腦賬，畏寒怕煩，體重祗有九十一磅。「治療之法」——診得曹君精枯已極，原因由於遺精過久，精關鬆弛。生殖腺衰禿不堪，神經衰弱乃相繼爆發。經余每日施行電療一次，以『希米脫氏固精片』治療遺精夢洩，同時服以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以培榮生殖腺，增加其內分泌，消滅其神經衰弱症，健全其脑力，增强其精力。治疗约三星期左右，遗精症首先停止，精神已轉生不少，神經衰弱症逐漸消滅，經過六星期，精力充旺，面色紅潤，上述諸症悉除。　　（二）早洩陰萎性器細小　　患者孔鐵山，二十四歲，江蘇無錫人。（主訴）——早年手淫過度，加之姿意荒淫，生殖腺大受損傷，二十二歲結婚，婚後即患早洩，陰萎等症，且局部細小，而神經衰弱症亦烈，時時無夢而遺，遺後有時驚醒，有則完全茫然。（診時病狀）——性機能已完全　　，陰徑細小，不類成人，且陰毛稀疏，睾丸萎縮，沒星期約遺精三次，攝護險亦萎縮，（治療之法）——攝護腺，並嚴厲知道其攝生衛，以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』為主要服藥。每日服三次，每次充足，發育轉佳，同時以『希米脫氏固精片』止其遺精，經過兩月，早洩，陰萎，遺精儘治，發育已轉佳。胃病治愈　　編者先生：　　敝人患胃病有年，食後每感胃部疼痛。且平時消化不良，清晨每有酸水吐出，久治不愈。上月初幸得敝友王君介紹『胃痛霸』名藥以治胃痛。並囑同時服『健胃素』以助長消化。余服後胃痛果止，現在胃口亦佳（徐詠先）　停經腹痛　　編者先生大鑒：　　敝人素有月經不調症，但完全停止，尚屬初次，且已兩月有半矣。並感服陳作。心火恐慌。幸余夫見報載有女用『生殖素』製，可治月經，並補體力。購來服後，月經果來，體亦强壯，此誠良藥，願為介紹。（啊娥）　駐顏有術　　編者先生：　　敝人素惡塗脂抹粉，因明瞭內分泌的充旺，實為美顏的最佳方法。故調於滋補藥的選擇，力求科學化。知女用『生殖素』可增進內分泌，服之可使常保青春，故余常服，自覺容光煥發，皮膚姣嫩，精神甚佳。（嚴玉華）白帶經年　　編者先生：　　敝人已變十，體弱多病，患白帶已經年矣。感覺煩惱已極，然雖多方求治，總不能斷根，後見報載女用『生殖素』可培元固本，服後可使精神壯健。『療帶靈』可止白帶。乃往先施公司各購一盒，服用之後，果然靈霄效無比，現在身體教前强壯數倍，而白帶已止。誠幸運也（翠生）美容研究女性健美和戀愛的關係  香港醫大醫學學士吳大超　　「女為悅已者容」，這是顛僕不破的至理名言，雖有人以為這話侮辱了女性，然而審美觀念，人人都有，選擇配偶，誰不喜歡選取最美麗的，所以越是美麗的女子，在情場上越容易勝利。　　因此，儘有許多女子把自己的美視向第二生命，想出許多化裝的方法。不過，真的美決不是化裝得出來的。脂粉至多能略增面部的美麗，而現代人心目中的美女子，並不專以面貌為標準，卻著眼於全身的健康美。　　皮膚必須富有而血色，紅潤豐腴；全身要發育均勻，曲線舉露，乳峯高聳，具有高度的勾引力；精神要飽滿活潑，方能使人樂於接近。像林黛玉式的病態美人，身軀瘦削，決不會有美麗的曲線和乳峯，并且愁眉苦臉，現代的青年決不願意得到這樣的愛人的。　　沒有健康美的姑娘們，在戀愛的競爭中無疑地是要失敗的。他們必得服食女性生殖腺素製劑『女用生殖素』，這種藥能促進生殖腺的內分泌，增進全身健康，刺進發育。所以連服一二月後，即能肌肉漸生，將枯乾的皮膚化得滑潤，使精神大振，乳峯發育完美，高聳而有彈性，造成以為健康，美麗，活潑的姑娘，男人們自然要爭先向之嫵媚了。不過，如果因身弱而患白帶，必須自行外用『療帶霉』以治之方好。自療常識我的骨痛求治經過  鄧尚文　　我的感染骨痛，雖然不能詳細指出其原因，但是我也曉得由於體力的衰弱，全之職務的過勞。這兩大原因，我可以確定使我爆發本症的主要原因。所以我會接觸過多數的專門醫生，他們也這樣承認這是我的病源。　　不過，我雖有自知之明，可是治療的結果，使我大失所望，五年中雖不斷地服藥治療，不僅不能將我的痛治好，而且有惡化的趨勢。起初我祗在工作後，腰背兩部感覺酸痛，後來精神愈萎頓，體力愈潺弱，而痛苦愈甚。漸漸蔓延及於骨節，現在已全身都感覺酸痛了。尤其在陰濕天氣，酸痛更甚。我見到這種情形，心中實在有些厭世觀念了。後幸朋友的介紹，囑服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以挽回衰老。並以『强斯登氏骨痛片』根治貴痛。據說治愈者頗不乏人，余乃將此兩藥間會治病的醫師，他說：不已服至兩月，所有骨痛之苦，完全解除，此戰出於鄙人意料之外也。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言日德同盟是謠傳乎  汶　　在侵略主義者進一步威脅今日世界和平勢力的陰謀下，又出現了日德同盟這一新的事實。儘管侵略者怎樣用掩蓋的方法，希圖使這一新的侵略陰謀，在更秘密的暗陬中進行，但事實還是給世界愛好和平的民眾看得明明白白。　　據德國海通通訊社東方經理符厚斯氏的聲明，這又是一個［謠言］。接着，他又特別注重的伸說了蘇聯存在的可惡，似乎非立即加以打倒不可。那末。這話不正是代表着被視為謠言的日德同盟的真實內容，又是什麽呢？這真是一個太惡毒的自身諷刺。原要聲明並無其事，而恰說出了真心話。符厚斯氏的聲明，恰正代表了被視為謠言的日德同盟的真髓還不夠嗎？　　世間盡有善於說詞的人，但天天報上登着的消息，總不能說全盤是假的。比如，半月來落於西班牙瑪德里城內已逾二十噸的炸藥，其牌號是德國製呢？意大利製呢？抑是又一國家所製？然而，據說，西班牙近二十萬無辜而死的人民，又是可惡的蘇聯所賜的云。真使我們糊塗了。　　日德同盟，落在中國人頭上的又是什麽一套花樣？友邦早已為這聲明，是：［共同防共］。這［共同］兩字，可有特別的解釋。若一旦實行起來，其陣容大概是如下：前鋒：中國人，中隊：仍是中國人，而落在遠遠後面的，才是正正式式的［皇軍］。前鋒統統死光了，補以中間隊部，不足，好在中國人多，再來一批，看看戰爭打到講了結了，中國人也死光，然後皇軍是不傷一兵一卒而又中原之天下。這不是一個幻想，一年來所謂［蒙偽軍］的侵察侵綏，就是現成的榜樣。不是常可以看見報上說，侵綏匪軍，在後［督隊］者則為某國軍云云嗎？現在是以中國人殺中國人，在［共同］名義下，將一定以中國人去殺另一外國人，尚何疑哉？　　然而中國人畢竟最會打如意算盤的。於是有人說道：不管他們同盟也好，不是事實也好，我們不管這些，希望他們也不要把我們牽進這同盟中去。這說得多麼寫意！可是現在的問題，不管你願不願，非來替他們當一下前鋒不可。彼時，就不讓你攏起袖子旁邊看好看。將奈之何？　　要不替人家當義務砲灰，先要有不願作砲灰的决心。誰友誰敵，事實已太清楚，撩起袖子，看看誰是我們真正的聯盟者，以自己的熱血洒滅一切陰謀利用的毒計，才是求生之道！咳嗽良劑　　［威靈複方白松糖漿］　　氣候失常，偶一不慎，易染傷風咳嗽，倘疏忽不治，每致有釀成肺癆之虞，本埠威靈漿行發明之［威靈複方白松糖漿］係治傷風咳嗽良劑，該劑係依據萬國名方，由著名藥師監製而成，不但善於化痰止咳，兼能鎮痙平喘，其味亦甘甜適口，尤為婦孺所愛服，定價大瓶衹售六角半，聞二馬路英華街口正威藥房代售，說話九二五二五，購買不取送力，胃病新藥　　五分鐘可以止痛　服數瓶永遠根除　　二馬路英華街口正威藥房所發明之［一七〇］胃痛藥水，係照最新科學方法精製而成，療治肝胃氣痛，胃炎，胃酸過多，消化不良，噎氣吞酸，胸膈飽脹，大便秘結等症，服後五分鐘，立可止痛，續服數瓶，永遠根除，蓋本品為液劑，入胃即可直接發揮止痛作用，超過其他藥片藥丸藥粉劑，功效迅速而宏偉，定價極廉，每瓶衹售七角半云。歸來  允海　　無論早晨或是黃昏，孫五嫂一偷了空便踏下了泥坡來在那高而且闊的堤邊，用手把額前遮成一個遙望的姿勢，像要從那渺茫的，也是神秘的無盡遠的海洋，找尋着她的目的物似的。這時候，她是焦急而且煩燥的。低微地詛咒了一句，又得飛一般轉身仍舊攀上了泥坡，回到自家兒的破船屋里去了，打罵那七歲大的一個傻孩子，和　　　見了太陽光。才個把月的嬰孩。——［個把月了！他還未看見過這小把戲呢！要是……］　　想到這上面去的時候，健康的孫五嫂顯得更年輕了的苦笑了一下。可是，才背轉過來，那連夜不斷噩夢又撩起他的愁思，自己安慰自己似的，又馬上把那懷的念頭摔得粉碎。跟着，勉強地把自己的想頭牽到更遠更遠的地方去了。可是，那淘氣的念頭待她一不留神又竄的扒上了她的心頭，瞎　瞎八地衝撞着。在費了她很多工夫以後，她勝利般自語着：［那不會的，那不會的。］　　孫五嫂從前是不愛做夢的，白天裏過分的工作把她身體的每一根骨節都吮吸完了以後，疲勞地她在哄着小孩睡；那弱得非常可憐的小把戲睡了，跟着她的眼睛也自然地閉上的了，這樣，一直到雄雞又啼四起來的時候，她才又怪惺松的扒起來，又開始這樣永遠不會停止的一天的工作。　　然而，當半月前那一場颶風巨雨以後，水一樣平靜的孫五嫂的心，也像水遇了風雨一般，不平靜起來了。　　她記念着他，而他是在兩月前趁着魚汎，乘風破浪地跟命運之神，跟反復無常的波濤決鬥去了。而今，便是兩個月了，照往常趕汎的例，早該掛着風帆駛入港裏來。然而，這一趟却非常出乎人意料之外，踪跡沒有，連往常帶訊的人都不知往哪兒去。風平浪靜還不至累人等得心焦，怕的却是半月前，那一場風雨［觀音菩薩，你便保佑他爹回來吧！他還沒有看見過他爹一面呢！大慈大悲救世觀音菩薩。……］　　夜裏，她的時間是在焦急和稟告中過去的，當太陽又快樂地來到她的木柵前掛上一個涎臉的時候，連梳洗也管不得地，第一個便翻過了泥坡，或者便站在泥坡上，把眼睛放到遠處去，看上一個七次八回，才算給孩子的哭聲喚進了屋子裏去。　　這幾天，孫五嫂發覺了跟她患着同一病症的同伴了。那不是一兩個，是一大羣。是這水村裏每一個她的丈夫都跟水搶飯吃的年青媳婦，她們和孫五嫂一樣是焦急着她們心頭上的人兒，不知會不會馬上便飛回來，撞入她們空虛的懷裏。　　［還不回來？］　　［等得人要命哇！］　　［怕不是……］　　這個像怕忌諱一樣，話兒在唇邊縮回去。人，却一窩蜂地跟着三兩句詛咒的話波動得變了吵擾。是一個不很少的騷動。　　［媽，我肚餓啊！……］　　說是七歲大，但還是柴枝一樣瘦小的，可是也相當野蠻的孩子，牽着媽的衣服在嚕囌了。拍——清脆的在那黑而且粗的面頰上響着的耳光，是唯一的答覆。　　日子便是這樣一天挨着一天地過去了。終於在一個大霧的早晨，當孫五嫂又在那泥坡上遙望，遠處一點小黑點搖　了她的枯竭了的心靈了。小黑點漸漸跟着朝霧長大了，她的嘴角裏裂開了一絲微笑。但是不爭氣的念頭又麻煩着她——［不會他不在那兒的吧……］　　黑點擠破了霧，是一條帆船般的影子。這個才衝進了孫五嫂的眼廉，像忘記了一切似的，她驚　着了：［回來了哩！回來了哩！］［回來了哩……］　　像深坑裏得回聲一樣，那邊也有一個同樣的聲音響起來了。而且，是急性的傳染病菌，這水村馬上都給傳染着了。人，無論年輕的，還是老婆婆，或是才會走路的小孩子，都從四面八方集攏了來了。每一個，這千百人裏的每一個，都掛上了一個不健康的微笑，在歡迎着這些跟生活搏鬥的戰士的歸來。有些甚至舞動起來了，雖然帆船才看見那尖尖的桅頂。　　在極度緊張的情緒下面；帆船開靠岸來了。　　［啊呀！……］轟的像炸彈爆發了似的，這一羣的情緒也爆發了。年輕的媳婦笑嘻嘻的找到了她的丈夫，老媽媽也扯着兒子的衣服哭笑不得，孩子哩，靠着爸爸的腳邊，看媽媽的流淚。……歡喜，快樂，和憂愁在這兒冶成一塊了。　　太陽已扒上了山頂，昏霧給嚇走了。這時，人也三三兩兩地同到那雖不算溫暖，但到底是［家］的家里去了。才翻過泥坡，這個看着孫五嫂懷里的孩子，有點像自語般說着：［我們］共四個人了？］在天堂裏  春波　　格貝爾斯剛剛一死，就跟了別一個死人到天門那裏去見聖彼得。　　［你在人間說謊了幾次？］彼得板了臉向着格貝爾斯的同伴：　　［唔，三次！］　　［那麼，］彼得嚴厲的回答，［繞走這天堂三次，周圍計一百基羅米突］。　　［而你，格貝爾斯部長，你說謊了幾次？］那個據有鎖匙的問。　　［善良的彼得，］格貝爾斯吃吃的說。［懲罰之前請給我開開恩吧，我要把我的機器腳腳踏車和幾噸石油從德國運來。（譯自世界語教育者火炬）街頭戲  時玳　　－香港漫寫之一－　　［一點安靜都不給我！］每次我都帶着氣氛走出西園酒店，這里所謂酒店（或酒樓）即是旅館。你住在酒店里別想有一點安靜，假如是乍病剛好的人，準會再把你吵病了。樓上樓下，幾乎是每個房間里，整天整夜都有人在搓麻將，有時一邊搓麻將，一邊有歌女彈唱，吵嚷得使你無法忍受。倒楣透啦，我被陷入這四面楚歌的竹戰環境里夜里弄得覺都睡不安。　　可是在香港你想找一家沒有搓麻將的旅館，跟你想登天而得到的結論是一樣。我從住進旅館里沒有一次能塌下心讀點書，一進屋子就是滿耳牌聲，因之，除了睡覺非在房間里不可，別的時間我就衹有到外邊去逛，海濱去洗洗澡，在沙灘上脫光幹兒晒晒太陽。不過大半的時光是花費在遊覽街市上。　　最先使我感興趣的是皇后大道，這條街可與上海的霞飛路相比，外國人和中國的摩登男女都薈萃於此。印度人，菲律賓人，夏威夷人，總是在踱來踱去。在這兒所見到的不過是享樂階級的紅男綠女，真正的殖民地的奴隸生活還是看不見。於是我去找新的街道，企圖發現奇跡。　　果然給我抓到了！在碼頭上有呻咽杭唷的苦力和船夫，齷蹉的小巷里有臥地吸毒的囚首垢面者，呌賣的小販，專向外國水兵兜攬生意的街頭妓女。街頭戲就是我抓到的奴隸生活之一。　　街頭戲是流動的，跟北平天橋［雲裏飛］差不多。幹這行玩藝兒的多是失業的伶人，六七個人搭合起來就成了個小班，沿街演唱，得以維持生活。　　晚上我想到美美公司去翻翻新出的雜誌，行經西營盤，却聽到一陣鑼鼓響。遠遠看到有一大堆人擠在街頭。我走近，看是唱戲的。男男女女圍成了個大圓圈子，做戲的完全跟大戲班一樣。畫粉面孔，假髻頭盔，槍刀劍戟，衣裝靴帽，一切都很齊全，唱的調子和意義我總不懂，但看觀眾那種鼓掌呌好的情形，可以知道他們是有相當的技藝。　　吹打樂器的衹有三個人，鑼鼓，弦琴，索喇，喉管等都由他們三人包辦，他們弄得忙手忙腳，忽然敲鑼，忽然又吹索喇，一點空閒都沒有。其中有個扮劇中角色的，他下場之後就去打鑼打鼓，戲裝仍舊穿在身上，不知道的以為他還是在做戲呢。等輪到他上場時，便又丟下鑼錘鼓棒急急比囊。　　一齣戲演完，他們都擔着小木碗，向觀眾討錢。臉上掛着笑，恭恭敬敬的呌着［老爺，］［太太］，有的人把他幾個［仙］，有的人簡直就是白看。收到的錢頂多不過四五毫仔。　　帶着失望的神情再擎起那木碗，向着兩邊樓上的人們討錢，為了使樓上的太太小姐歡心，他們不斷的做出［滑稽相］，或是說幾句趣話，老半天才容易討到幾個仙，於是敲起鑼鼓再演唱。　　［你們一天有多少收入？］同來的廣州朋友問一個扮旦角的。　　［先生！頂多不過五塊錢，吃了飯，一個也剩不下，苦透啦！苦透啦！］　　［巡捕不干涉你們嗎？］　　［我們每個月給他們衙門納五塊錢的捐哪，不然他不准在街上演！］　　在殖民地上掙扎的奴隸們，他們在受着更深重的壓迫和剝削，過着非人的生活。</p>

<p>糖坊  江天　　蔗園裏的甘蔗，已經是又肥又密的長到七八尺高了，這情形，又是豐收了　　蔗園的主人，他照例又是一淸早就坐在那園邊的樹根頭上，他在打算，還是收下來做糖呢？還是等他再長一點割到市上去賣？這主意，在他心裏已經打算了好幾天，但老是沒有一個决定；一想了這件事，他那已經皺紋滿佈的額頭，又加上了幾條更深的痕跡。　　在往年，到這個時候，四處的田野裏，除了水坑邊的幾堆外，那一處的蔗園，都已割得乾乾凈掙了，說不定蔗葉和皮都已在村子裏的每個爐灶裏化成黑灰了。而山坡旁的那一排糖坊的烟囱，也許已是終夜不息的在噴出烟霧來。可是今年不同，一切都不同，蔗還在園裏生長着，糖坊還在靜寂着，人在左思右想着。　　「老二伯：你早呀，你們的糖坊那天開工？用得着我來帮帮忙嗎？」　　每天上城裏去擔糞的李阿福，這時擔着糞桶一步一喘氣的從大路上回來，他把糞桶停在路邊，也走到樹根頭坐下休息，也望望園裏的蔗問着。　　「糖坊開工，連我也不知幾時，我現在老是打算不開，做起糖呢？還是賣？」　　「唔，今天在墟上聽入家說，今年的蔗都豐收，墟上的價錢賣得很便宜，我想你還是做糖的好，免得吃大虧，，反正糖的價錢總好點」。　　「話倒不錯，可是糖的價錢雖好，但沒有人要，你不知道嗎？現在洋糖來得多，價錢又便宜，誰還吃本地糖呢，所以我老是打算不開，就是爲這……」　　談到蔗價便宜，洋糖也便宜，老二就只好呆着，他不知怎樣才好。　　約莫到了快近中午了，他又沒精打彩的站起來，望着山坡邊的村子裏走去，可是當走村門口的糖坊時，他却站住了足，望一望給灰塵所蒙住而還隱的可見的那寫着源記塘坊的老招牌。　　吃過了午飯之後，老二走到祠堂前的小茶館裏去，他在那裏，會到了也是有蔗園有糖坊的幾個老朋友，他剛一坐下，坐在他對面的福記糖坊的主人，就問他：　　「老二，你怎樣打算呢P再不開工就只好割下來去賣了。」　　「老二是最有主意，我們談了半天還是不知怎樣弄好呢？還是你來出主意吧！」坐在打橫的許老大揷上一句。　　老二皺了幾下眉頭，喝了幾口茶，停了大半天才開口說：　　「我也沒有辦法，想來想去總是不合算，賣了還補不足肥料本錢，做出糖來，賣貴沒有人要，賣便宜又是虧本，你們大家想吧！兩頭虧的生意，就是神仙也無辦法了，看情形，只好過些時再說。」　　他說完了又喝茶，眼睛閉起來，像呆子一樣，又是　天不嚮。這時打橫坐的許老大又接着說：　　「人家沒有糖坊的，都把它包割出去了，我們現在再不打定主意，那結果弄得連包割給人家都不行了，像今年這樣豐收，誰還吃得這麽多呢？」　　幾個老頭子，坐在一起的呆着，誰也都在想着賣呢還是做成糖。這個問題，可是誰也想不出一個辦法來。可是他們却有一條心，他們只有恨那洋糖賣得太便宜，恨今年太豐收了。　　山坡旁的糖坊終於不見一家開工，蔗園裏的蔗葉却還像麥穗一般的碧綠，在秋風的吹颳下搖擺着。然而阿福每天從城裏回來說，今天又有幾十擔的洋糖擔進城裏了，蔗在墟上，二個銅子可以買一條又肥又長的。播音話劇　　電送劇社　　佛音（九八〇）下午九時至十時　　娜拉　　常滔佛正在對娜拉大發脾氣的時候，突然從女僕那裏遞來一封信，拆了開來一看，却是柯樂克把那紙借據退回來了。這，眞出於他倆意料之外的事。　　原來那是林敦夫人爲友情而不顧一切去挽救娜拉夫婦。　　滔佛見事已是沒有問題，他又四起娜拉：「小鳥兒」小松鼠了。　　但是，娜拉呢？她此時才覺悟到：『我跟爸爸的時候，他呌我做玩意兒孩子」，他把我做玩意兒，正像我玩我的玩意兒一樣，後來我到你家同住，我那時不過從爸爸手裏換到你的手裏，我是你的「玩意見妻子」，正如我在家時是我爸爸的「玩意兒孩子」一樣。……　　覺悟後的娜拉，她毅然立刻離開她經過八年甜蜜生活的丈夫，離開她三個活潑可愛的小寳貝，回到她老家去，找一點事做，以求人生之眞諦。歌唱　　上海歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）下午六時半至八時　　我願意　淸早起來　　摩登戀愛　好朋友來了　　在月上　新鳳陽歌　　雁羣　春花秋果　　國花　賣花女　　吹泡泡　丁丁當太太　　我們的皇后　夜戰塲　　在月下　　靑天如覆鉢。四望何寥廓。朗月當頭。只覺得家虛零落。亮晶晶的光波。冷淸淸的塲合。萬里凄凉。可悶死拉孤單單的一個。哦，嘆紅顏比烟還薄。淚比霞還多。恨比天還闊。夢境在誘惑。棲鳥在軟窩。羣星在笑樂。借問月兒呀。你你你獨自團圓囉。是不是也透着那們一點快活。快活，哦。　　中心火灼。意興何蕭索。亂世荒年。總不絕天災人禍。急忙忙的靑春。苦茵茵的生活。萬里銀河。肯讓我孤魂兒來寄託。哦，再難忍耐着心過。盡此壽兒磨。任給繩縛。骨肉在宰割。身體在網羅。精神在炮烙。奮鬥在何時。我我我才能解脫哩。問一問小嫦娥可到底是誰的罪惡。罪惡，哦。　　中國歌劇社　　新新（七八〇）下午七時至八時　　打長江（黃韻）　　湖上之歌　（余林）（飛霞）　　湘江憶君　（飛虹）　　淸明吟　（秋玲）　　綠牡丹　（秋琍）　　圓圓月　（白瑯）　　慰勞歌　（飛虹）　　爵士歌劇社　　華興（一二六〇）下午九時五分至五十分　　自然的孩子　（姚莉）　　人面桃花　（姚英）　　夜半的私語　（露茜）　　一身都是愛　（張俊）　　離別了姑娘　（姚莉）　　你要唱歌　（姚英）　　春之花　（露茜）　　打哼歌　（張俊）彈詞　　曹笑英「玉蜻蜓」　　中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻　　開篇「新寳玉探病」　　怡紅公子與顰卿。兩小無猜各有情。不料天公偏嫉妬。使佳人抱病困愁城。嬌軀臥在瀟湘館。小婢嘗將藥茗烹。歎息知心人缺少。心中感觸淚盈盈。忽開鸚鵡聲聲喚。說有客敲門呼鵑婢名。急命丫環房外去。問何人到此要聽淸。那丫環奉命將門啟。見是寳玉前來便感觸生。因爲他夤夜而來是難得事。足見他，多情多義自天成。急忙接過燈籠後。便引導進門脚步輕。走到床前來禀告。說寳二爺今晚一人行。親身到此來探病。奴一片誠心代主迎。他已到床前來見你。你有何曲直好請他評。黛</p>

<h3>After the Recovery of Bailingmiao, the Bandits and Puppets Increased Reinforcements in Preparation for a Counterattack; A Certain Army Arrived at Shangdu; Our Troops Searched Near the Temple; Bao Yueqing Was Reorganizing His Remnants</h3>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) After the failure of the bandit puppets to invade Suiyuan, they suffered heavy casualties in deaths and desertions. They are currently seizing civilian laborers in Shangdu to rush to build defensive works, intending to defend to the death. Those on the eastern border of Suiyuan are mostly from the Rehe Army. On the morning of the 25th, more than 3,000 Rehe troops moved westward from Duolun via Zhangbei. On the 26th, they are expected to arrive at Shangdu. In Jiageying, between Jiaxiasi and Kangbao, there are currently 2,000 Rehe artillerymen stationed, with twelve field guns and more than forty small steel guns, being the elite of the Rehe artillery. Within days, Prince De will go from a certain place to East Sunite Banner. A certain party is rushing to build an airfield in Jiageying day and night, covering an area of more than ten hectares, and is building a gasoline depot. Cement is being transported from Duolun. Recently, three divisions of a certain army arrived in Duolun from Chifeng and moved westward in full force. On the afternoon of the 25th, six cars of poison gas bombs were transported from Zhangbei to Jiageying. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, 2,000 soldiers from a certain army and bandit army arrived in Shangdu from Duolun on the morning of the 25th, preparing to bypass the grassland to reinforce and launch a counterattack in the Bailingmiao area. Two division commanders of the Central Government have arrived in Suiyuan from Beijing to discuss military plans with Fu Zuoyi. At the moment, Pingdiquan and Ping-Sui Railway are very peaceful. On the 25th, our troops searched for remnants of the bandits near Bailingmiao. Also, five bandit planes flew to the northeast of Bailingmiao on the morning of the 25th for reconnaissance. Prince De is still in Jiaxiasi. On the morning of the 25th, he ordered Bao Yueqing to fly to the northeast of Bailingmiao to reorganize the remnants. (25th Central News Agency Electric Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guihua) During the battle of Bailingmiao on the night of the 23rd and morning of the 24th, there were many people from a certain party commanding in the bandit army. The reason why our army won was because we used a trick in advance to destroy the temple's radio station, cutting off the bandit army's communication. A large number of bandit reinforcements could not arrive in time. Our army had already entered the temple. Yun Tu sent representatives to the temple at noon on the 24th to comfort our army. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

At that time, the bandits attacking our Wuchuan and Guyang were repelled by us and also returned to the temple one after another. Our pursuing troops also arrived in time and double-teamed the bandits with the bypassing troops. More than a thousand bandits engaged in a fierce battle with us all night, going back and forth more than ten times. We bombarded them with artillery. Our Liu Regiment and Zhang Company took the lead in rushing into the temple. The various units pressed forward one after another. At dawn on the 24th, the bandits were unable to withstand it and fled in a northeastern direction. Our entire army occupied the temple at around 9 AM on the 24th.

At the same time, other troops launched a frontal assault. After receiving the news of the recovery of Bailingmiao here, there was great joy. Although this news has not yet been verified by independent sources, the telegram from Chinese sources in Guihua described the situation of this battle in great detail. According to reports, the Chinese army advanced rapidly to outflank and attacked the rear of the enemy advancing towards the Chinese army line north of Guihua, and captured Bailingmiao yesterday morning.

<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian, director of the Suiyuan Office in Taiyuan, told people that the recovery of Bailingmiao by our army has been completely confirmed. The bandits attacking Guyang and Wuchuan have lost their base and may be attacked from both sides. Continuous battles have been occurring in the Xinghe area of eastern Suiyuan in recent days. Our defensive works are solid, and we will give the bandits a head-on blow when they come. It is reported that the puppet army recently has four divisions and some units from a certain party, advancing from Duolun towards Zhangbei Shangdu. Part of them have arrived in Shangdu, and a number of armored cars and tanks have been transported there, as well as a considerable amount of light and heavy weapons, intending to launch another large-scale attack. Looking at the overall situation of the war, it is still in the stage of initiation. The battles before the 25th were also considered by the League of Nations to be a major war. We hope that the people in the rear will maintain a calm and persistent spirit and provide spiritual and material assistance to the troops at the front fighting the bandits and defending the territory. It has been found that what the front line lacks most is leather clothing. If the soldiers can get cold-weather gear, it is believed that their combat effectiveness will definitely increase. As for the strength of the bandit army, before the battle of Hongge'ertu, they had a total of 30,000 guns. Wang Ying, Li Shouxin, Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shuhai, etc., are all included. After the defeat at Hongge'ertu, they suffered heavy losses. Although the puppet army now claims to have four divisions joining, the total is only 40,000 to 50,000 people. Our central reinforcements have all reached their destinations and are strong, not comparable to the bandits. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Issues a Written Statement</h3>

I have long intended to come to the south to visit and contribute if I have the opportunity. Recently, I have repeatedly received invitations from Commander-in-Chief Yu, Chairman Huang, and Mayor Zeng, so I came to Canton to participate in the reopening ceremony of the Canton branch of the Guangdong Bank Limited. The Guangdong Bank was originally founded by overseas Chinese and has a history of more than 20 years. Its past performance was very outstanding. Due to the impact of the global economic downturn and the mismanagement of the authorities, it ceased operations. However, because of its good reputation in the past, the proposal to reorganize soon arose. People from all walks of life believe that maintaining the bank is the same as helping the prosperity of Guangdong and restoring the commercial reputation of the Cantonese people. Moreover, with national unification, the opening of the Guangdong railway, agriculture, industry, and commerce have all had good opportunities for development, and there is a real need for a sound financial institution. This is why the agreement was reached. In the future, the bank can actively participate in construction projects and serve its hometown. The board of directors and management departments of the bank have been newly organized and have good management. Its foundation should be solid, and its contribution to compatriots at home and abroad should be better. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Basic Understanding of the Sino-Japanese Problem (Part 2) — Reading Mr. Yamazaki Yasuchun's "After China Rejects Japan" —</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xianwen</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the Chinese government can thoroughly fight imperialism, among the many famous figures in both government and public circles that Mr. Yamazaki encountered, only "China's Gorky" Lu Xun gave a clear answer. He resolutely and decisively negated this question, and said: "As for when China can be liberated from imperialism, I am a pessimist. Perhaps it will be when China becomes a desert, perhaps it will be when the Chinese people implement the so-called starvation tactics, but this time is already approaching, the Gobi Desert is gradually moving south, and the Arabian Desert is also gradually moving east." Lu Xun's opinion is certainly representative of one aspect; however, if I have not misunderstood Mr. Yamazaki's true intention, then what his first question implies to us is that the Chinese should not "drive away the tiger from the front door, and let the wolf in from the back door"; they should not, in the heat of opposing Japanese imperialism, introduce the forces of British and American imperialism, and then regret it too late. Therefore, he said: "The fundamental motive for Europe and America to show goodwill to China is still based on capitalist and commercial considerations... If they can really go further and help China, then at that time, their inherent strong imperialist ambitions will also be blatantly displayed, and China will inevitably encounter great difficulties again..." In principle, I can agree with this. I once wrote a miscellaneous essay for a certain publication, entitled "Compradors and Servants"; it began by saying that when capitalism develops to the stage of imperialism, it will inevitably seek colonies abroad. Japanese imperialism certainly wants to make China its colony, and British and American imperialism is no exception. However, "everyone can perform magic tricks, but each has their own skill." Although it is said that Japan's natural environment and economic conditions are the reasons for this, Japanese imperialism's methods of dealing with China are not as clever as those of the British and Americans. The British and Americans regard the Chinese as compradors, while the Japanese regard the Chinese as nothing more than servants. Although both compradors and servants serve their masters, one only needs to generally obey the master's instructions, while the other must follow the master's orders in every move. As the saying goes, "People aim high and water flows low." Abandoning being a servant to become a comprador is something that a few Chinese people who are accustomed to being slaves may do, but most Chinese people who value their personality will never make a comparison between compradors and servants, and are willing to use iron and blood to break free from the shackles of all imperialism. Regarding this point, Mr. Yamazaki seems to have no need to worry.</p>
<p>However, it is one thing for the Chinese people to use iron and blood to break free from the shackles of all imperialism, and it is another thing to concentrate all their strength to fight a life-or-death battle with Japan first when Japanese imperialism is oppressing them too much, while temporarily "letting go of other imperialisms." Of course, this "temporarily letting go of other imperialisms" may result in a situation of "driving away the tiger from the front door, and letting the wolf in from the back door," but the formation of this situation is by no means due to the willingness of the Chinese people, but is a result of "being forced by circumstances, having no other choice." Because the tiger at the front door is fiercer than the jackal at the back door, when one is unable to resist both the tiger and the jackal, it is better to resist the fiercer tiger first, and perhaps there will be a glimmer of hope. Even if the result is still inevitable death at the hands of the jackal, and one still becomes the jackal's food, this is by no means a matter of favoring the jackal and hating the tiger; to put it bluntly, this is by no means that the Chinese are willing to be compradors of British and American imperialism rather than servants of Japanese imperialism. Regarding this point, Mr. Yamazaki should pay attention.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Yamazaki's second question is: After the Chinese people succeed in resisting Japan, how will they build their country? Mr. Yamazaki raised the issue of active construction on the reverse side of passive resistance against Japan. Regarding this question, Mr. Yamazaki gave many reasons, saying that China's decision to take the old road of capitalist countries has been made. That is, Mr. Yamazaki's first "the times have passed." Similarly, if I have not misunderstood Mr. Yamazaki's true intention, then what his second question implies to us is that the Chinese should pay attention to the result of resisting Japan: China can no longer take the old road of capitalism. If you do not want to take the path of Soviet Russia, then you must be slightly cautious about the current resistance against Japan. Not only do you need to be cautious, but you must even join hands with Japan. Therefore, Mr. Yamazaki said: "In the future, it is too late for China to use capitalist methods to establish a truly modern nation-state. China's only way to survive is to join hands with Japan, or it will be dominated by Soviet Russia; China must choose one of these two paths." Regarding this question, my opinion is as follows. To say that China can no longer take the old road of capitalism is to say that China has no future for capitalism. In today's entire capitalism, which is in a very dangerous situation, discerning people can agree: (Major premise) Even the Kuomintang, which is now in power, has absolutely no intention of leading China onto the path of capitalism with the Three Principles of the People it believes in. Mr. Zhou Fohai, the current Minister of People's Training of the Kuomintang Central Committee, repeatedly explained in his great work "On the Theoretical System of the Three Principles of the People" that "the ultimate goal of livelihood is to overthrow the capitalist system." China certainly has no future for capitalism, but may I ask, where is the future of Japanese capitalism? If China and Japan were completely on an equal footing, then given China's vast territory and rich resources, whether in terms of the sales of industrial products or the supply of raw materials, if one had to say that there was a future for capitalism (premise), it would only be stronger than Japan, and certainly not worse than Japan. Therefore, if Japan could refrain from invading China, that is, completely stand on an equal footing with China, and maintain the capitalist system, then China's capitalism would certainly not have a bright future, but at least it would be able to survive for a while compared to Japan. Now, given China's vast territory and rich resources, it is impossible to compare with Japanese capitalism; and given Japan's narrow territory and scarce resources, its capitalism can survive for a while. This fact tells us that China has been made a sacrifice for Japan. Therefore, if one wants to say that capitalism has no future, then the Japanese themselves should first seek another way out. Regarding this point, Mr. Yamazaki should consider.</p>

<h3>Regulating Food and Grading Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The Provisional Measures for Food Regulation drafted by the Executive Yuan and the four ministries including the Ministry of Industry passed yesterday, still allow domestic food to circulate freely, and all provinces and cities will uniformly stop the ban on transportation. As for whether to prohibit exports in the future, it will be necessary to wait for an investigation of the monthly import and export quantities reported by the customs, and then re-examine and approve when it is deemed necessary to prohibit the export of any kind of food. In addition, it is also stipulated that the Ministry of Industry and this Bureau should consult with local officials to appropriately reduce the transportation costs of vehicles transporting and selling food in bumper harvest areas to regulate food transportation. If this is followed, it is hoped that the price of food will be leveled and production and sales will be close.</p>
<p>However, to solve the entire problem of people's food, this is only a part of the temporary solution. Even if transportation and storage are handled without a solution to the problem of grading rice and wheat, there will still be many difficulties. Taking storage as an example, the rice or wheat grown by farmers are mostly different in body, uneven in color, unequal in grain size, and inconsistent in variety. If they are to be stored separately, it will not only cost more space, but also increase the procedures for storage and redemption. Even during transportation and sales, packaging, distribution, and sample sales will also add a lot of trouble. Therefore, to handle storage and facilitate transportation and sales, it is fundamentally necessary to start with the grading of rice and wheat. Without this, it is like ignoring the root and trying to regulate the branches.</p>
<p>Grading rice and wheat is a difficult task that cannot be accomplished overnight. In the past, it was heard that Jiangsu Province, in order to facilitate the progress of the agricultural warehouse business, subsidized a huge amount of money to entrust the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to carry out the grading of wheat produced in Jiangsu Province. It took a year to see results. Now that the Ministry of Industry has taken on the responsibility of regulating food, and the Agricultural Bank has taken transportation and sales as its main business, it is appropriate to plan and implement this basic work as soon as possible. We believe that this matter should be handled by the Ministry of Industry allocating funds to expand the organization, collect products from various regions, inspect and determine the grades separately, and then storage and transportation and sales will be free from interference, and there will be standards to follow for market circulation.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the results of how to improve and standardize rice and wheat varieties after a series of grading inspections will also provide principles for reference. As a result of variety improvement and standardization, grading and inspection will inevitably become more convenient in the future. Those who generally study the problem of food in the country have long known the importance of grading and inspecting rice and wheat, so they have been expecting its implementation eight or nine years ago. Now that Jiangsu Province has a considerable foundation, it will be more standardized to promote it in various provinces in the future. It is hoped that the industrial authorities will set everything up in detail on this issue as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact Signed in Berlin Yesterday; Agreement Valid for Five Years; Recognizing the Comintern's Harm to Peace; Two Countries Cooperating to Take Defensive Measures</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an official announcement here, the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact was signed in Berlin at noon today. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The anti-'Comintern' agreement between Germany and Japan was signed at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here at noon today. The German side was represented by the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, and the Japanese side was represented by the Ambassador to Germany, Mushakoji. Ambassadors from all countries stationed in Germany, except for the Soviet Ambassador, were invited to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and did not leave until 1 p.m. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) When the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Pact" was signed, in addition to the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, and the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mushakoji, also present were the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, Inogami, the Military Attaché, General Oshima, the German Minister Plenipotentiary, Elmansdorf, and the Director of the British Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Ruhmer. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, in front of the ambassadors of all countries except Soviet Russia, the German authorities announced that Germany and Japan had concluded an "Anti-Comintern" agreement. The agreement was signed today by the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, General Ribbentrop, and the Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Viscount Mushakoji, and will take effect immediately for a term of five years. It stipulates that the authorities of both countries should take strict measures to deal with those who work directly or indirectly for the Comintern at home and abroad. It is expected that a standing committee will be appointed to facilitate cooperation between the two countries. According to the agreement, the governments of Germany and Japan recognize that the purpose of the Comintern is to undermine and infringe upon all existing countries by all possible means. The two governments feel that tolerating the Comintern's interference in the internal affairs of various countries will not only harm the internal peace and social well-being of the country, but also threaten world peace. The two governments have agreed to inform each other of the activities of the Comintern, and to cooperate closely to discuss and implement defense methods. The two countries intend to invite other countries whose internal peace is harmed by the work of the Comintern to join this agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Contents Include Three Points</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an official announcement, the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact was signed in Berlin at noon today. The contents of the agreement point out that the purpose of the Comintern is to plot the collapse of all existing countries. If we tolerate this interference, not only will the internal peace and social well-being of other countries be endangered, but the entire peace of the world will also be threatened. Therefore, Germany and Japan are willing to cooperate sincerely and jointly defend against this communist plot to cause the collapse of existing countries. The points that both parties have agreed upon are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) To notify each other of the activities of the Communist Party, to discuss necessary defense methods, and to cooperate closely to implement these methods.</p>
<p>(2) Jointly discuss with other countries whose internal peace is threatened by the Comintern to adopt defense methods in accordance with the spirit of this agreement, or even join this agreement.</p>
<p>(3) The period during which this agreement is in effect shall be limited to five years.</p>
<h3>Subsidiary Protocol</h3>
<p>There is another type of protocol that stipulates the following: (1) The authorities of Germany and Japan must have close cooperation in exchanging information on the Communist International and exchanging intelligence and methods for defending against the Communist International. (2) The authorities of the two countries should take strict sanctions against those who directly or indirectly participate in the Comintern's activities to plot the collapse of other countries at home and abroad, or provide assistance to them. (3) In order to facilitate cooperation between the two countries, a standing committee shall be established to consider good strategies for defending against the activities of the Comintern (Reuters dispatch, 25th).</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the establishment of the German-Japanese Anti-"Comintern" Pact, the permanent committee stipulated therein will be established in Berlin. In addition, a cultural agreement will be signed within a few days, stipulating that the two signatories should send university professors, technicians, artists, and students to each other to attack their mistakes. As for the mutual dispatch of military delegations to visit and learn from each other's countries, it has already been actively carried out. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs</h3>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a declaration, claiming that since the establishment of the Comintern, it has been engaged in various activities that greatly threaten world peace. At the Seventh Congress of the Comintern last year, it was decided to form a united front with the Second International to resist fascism and imperialism, and to target Germany, Japan, and Poland as its future activities. The congress also decided to assist the Chinese Communist Party to fight against Japan. The declaration also mentioned the recent Spanish incident as ironclad proof of the Comintern's interference in the internal affairs of other countries. The declaration also stated that communist activities in the Far East include China and Japan, and the Chinese mainland has also been ravaged by the communist army. "Manchukuo" is now also carrying out activities of the Comintern. Any action against the Comintern must be based on international cooperation. Germany and Japan are now in the same environment with regard to the Comintern, so they have specially concluded this agreement. However, the purpose of this agreement is only to jointly defend against the Comintern. The Japanese government is now willing to cooperate with as many powers as possible to complete all plans to defend against the threat of the Comintern. The purpose of this agreement is only for this purpose. There are no other agreements behind this agreement, because the Japanese government does not want to establish or participate in any special international group. Furthermore, this agreement is not aimed at Soviet Russia or any other country. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>German Explanation</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Boetticher, recently showed the full text of the "Anti-Comintern" agreement established by Germany and Japan to foreign journalists, and said, "The original text of the agreement is very clear and does not need to be explained. Its goal is to save European culture. Looking back at the Seventh Congress of the Third International, which was held in August last year, it had already discussed various practical plans to transform Spain into a Soviet Republic and to establish people's fronts in other countries. It can be seen that the Third International has openly declared war on all countries in the world. The actions of the German National Socialist Party against communism are not new facts. Seeing that the Spanish civil war is extremely brutal, we know that the time is urgent and cannot be hesitated any longer. We must wait until world opinion is awakened before we can take action." The journalists then asked why this agreement was signed by the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop. Boetticher replied that Ribbentrop's struggle against Bolshevism was the same as that of other Germans, but he was ordered to preside over these negotiations. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Negotiation Process</h3>
<p>Negotiations between Germany and Japan on the establishment of an anti-"Comintern" agreement have been going on for more than a day. Until the summer of this year, the German Ambassador to Japan, Toshi, returned home to report on his work, and after repeatedly discussing with the leader Hitler, the Minister of Aviation, General Goering, and the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, in the city of Berchtesgaden, it began to take concrete form. At that time, although Ribbentrop had said that this agreement would be very inconvenient for the European political situation, the negotiations were still mostly presided over by Ribbentrop, and assisted by Lumer, the Director of the British Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Later, he also returned to the Italian government to probe their opinions, but that country had no intention of joining this concrete agreement, so the anti-communist agreement, which had been brewing for a long time, was only signed by Germany and Japan. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>German News Agency Issues Statement Maintaining Friendship with China</h3>
<p>The Shanghai German News Agency, from the official German agency stationed in China, has obtained the following explanation of the German-Japanese agreement. This announcement is not an alliance or a military agreement, because the agreement only concerns these two countries. Moreover, the agreement is completely non-interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, so the agreement can be said to be a kind of security measure, or the domestic policy of the two countries. The agreement does not affect the sovereignty of other countries and everything else. The impact of the agreement on China as discussed in various Chinese newspapers is completely inaccurate, because the agreement does not harm China's sovereignty and other powers. Germany has always adopted a friendly policy towards China, and will continue to be friendly in the future. Germany knows that this agreement with Japan is completely anti-communist, that is, the establishment of the Third International. China does not need to have any doubts about this, because China is also reaping the benefits of suppressing bandits.</p>
<h3>British and French Public Opinion Opposes Anti-Communist Crusade</h3>
<p>(London) After the establishment of the German-Japanese "Anti-Comintern Agreement," political figures here have not commented on it, but because the signatory on the German side is the Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, and Ribbentrop did not notify the British government that he would participate in the matter when he returned home the other day, they were extremely surprised. In addition to the disappointment of political figures, they were also deeply surprised by the fact that Germany and Japan had reached this agreement after a short period of negotiations. In addition, responsible figures predict that British newspapers will oppose the organization of the "Anti-Communist Crusade," and the media will also vehemently oppose Ribbentrop's participation in this matter. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the establishment of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Agreement, diplomatic figures here did not express surprise, but said that the matter was of great importance and deserved to be studied in the long term. Political figures said that the agreement could only be applied to internal affairs, and French public opinion would certainly strongly oppose this kind of ideological crusade. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Germany and Japan established an anti-'Comintern' agreement and decided to establish a permanent joint committee, political figures here commented on it, believing that the Japanese government's political ideology has always been known for its wisdom, and that it will certainly not be drawn into the European vortex in the future. However, we cannot but have deep doubts about the work that this joint committee can carry out. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspaper Observations: Points of Conflict of Interest Between Japan and Germany</h3>
<p>(Moscow) "Moscow News" editorial: "Hitler's attempt to organize a so-called anti-Bolshevik group has begun to be realized internationally due to the conclusion of the German-Italian and German-Japanese agreements. The only driving force behind the diplomatic policies of Germany, Italy, and Japan is extremely unscrupulous nationalism and chauvinism, aggression against other countries to expand their territory, and even dreams of dominating the world. This so-called anti-communism is a hypocritical mask to deceive people. We do not want to overemphasize the importance of the German-Italian agreement. Tsiano's visit to Berlin has not been able to limit or even reduce the deep divide between Germany and Italy. As for the day that Tsiano left Germany, German representatives, in private conversations, stated that they still despised Italy at all times, and that their compromise was because they had to impress Britain. However, if they could obtain compensation from Britain, Germany would be willing to immediately abandon its new alliance in exchange. Naturally, Italy has also told Britain the same words."</p>
<p>"Germany's interests have nothing in common with Japan's. Germany's trade with Japan is extremely small, while China is an excellent market for German goods, and German industry is increasingly making full use of it. Germany knows full well that if China completely submits to Japan, this market will be lost. At the same time, Germany's desire for colonies is always mindful of the islands under Japanese mandate. Therefore, one of the goals of the German-Japanese agreement is also to intimidate Britain. What unites Germany, Italy, and Japan is not a common positive goal, but only a common negative goal. The only common point unique to these three countries is that each aims at aggression and military expansion, and their opposition to the League of Nations and the organization of collective security has become consistent."</p>
<p>"Thus, one sees this group of three openly aggressive fascist countries, whose purpose is to oppose peace and oppose all those who guarantee peace. Even if the organization has not been fully successful, Hitler has repeatedly decided to attack alliances and group systems, claiming that he only wants to conclude bilateral pacts with neighboring countries, but he is now actually forming a group with countries that are not neighboring countries. The hypocrisy of his slogan has been exposed again by himself."</p>
<p>"Western European diplomacy, picking up Hitler's leftovers, has also claimed to oppose group systems. Now Hitler has formed his own group and aims to realize his aggressive plans. Will those diplomats still oppose the union of peace-loving countries? Whether the international peace organization can confront the international aggression organization will be seen in the next few months." (TASS dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Urges Britain to Participate in Anti-Communism; British Government Remains Cold</h3>
<p>(London) According to today's "Daily Telegraph," Prime Minister Baldwin told the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, that if Germany and Russia severed diplomatic relations, it would have a serious impact on European peace. Ribbentrop then told the Prime Minister that if Russia executed the German engineer Stichling, Germany would sever relations with Russia, and asked the Prime Minister whether Britain could participate in the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact. The Prime Minister refused to consider it. (National News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) There have been many rumors about the deterioration of relations between Germany and Russia recently. Well-informed sources recently stated that the German Ambassador, Ribbentrop, and the Russian Ambassador, Maisky, did not mention this matter when talking to officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently. Responsible figures also said that when Ribbentrop visited Prime Minister Baldwin the other day, he was probably well aware that the British government did not quite agree with Germany and Russia severing diplomatic relations, and that it did not think that the German government was trying to influence international issues with ideological issues. There is no doubt that Ribbentrop will report this impression to his government when he flies back to Germany today. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>American Attitude: Maintaining Absolute Neutrality</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the establishment of the anti-communist agreement between Germany and Japan, the impression gained by political figures here is that since the United States has no way to oppose the conclusion of an alliance treaty between the two countries, it is willing to maintain an absolutely neutral attitude. Generally speaking, the goal of the agreement is, on the one hand, to surround the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, to indicate that if there is anyone who is hostile to Germany, Japan will come forward in the Far East to interfere in order to lend support. Seeing that the staff members of the general staffs of Germany and Japan are cooperating closely, and that Germany has allowed Japan to develop its air force, it can be seen that this agreement has already taken effect. In the United States, any war crisis will not spare any cost, and we must promote a policy of isolation in order to avoid being drawn into the vortex, so we will not interfere with the establishment of an agreement between Germany and Japan.

<h3>Soviet Russian Authorities Continue to Arrest German Nationals, Relations Between the Two Countries Worsen</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Following the death sentence handed down by a Soviet Russian court to German engineer Stieklin, accused of sabotage in Siberian mining areas, relations between Russia and Germany are on the verge of collapse. It is now reported that Soviet Russian authorities continued to arrest three more German nationals on Saturday and Sunday, further inflaming anti-Russian sentiment in Germany. This news was reported by the Moscow correspondent of the German official news agency. The telegram was brief, only mentioning the surnames of the three arrested: one is engineer Bosshelz, and the other two are Xingde and Steimerl. It is reported that the German Embassy in Russia is currently investigating this matter in detail. (Reuter's, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Soviet court's previous death sentence for German engineer Stigglin, the local morning paper recently reported that the Political Department of the Soviet Russian Communist Party is still divided on whether to carry out the death sentence or grant a pardon. Heavy Industry Commissioner Ordzhonikidze, Transportation Commissioner Kaganovich, and others believe that Soviet Russian law applies equally to foreign nationals and domestic citizens, without discrimination, so the law should be strictly enforced without any regard for diplomatic considerations. Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov also agrees with this view, believing that even if Germany takes retaliatory measures, it will only be applied to Soviet Russian nationals within Germany. However, Chairman of the People's Committee Molotov, Military Commissioner Voroshilov, and Deputy Foreign Affairs Commissioner Krestinsky, among others, believe that relations between Germany and Russia should not be further deteriorated. The two sides have such different opinions that even Communist Party General Secretary Stalin cannot decide. It is rumored that the matter must be decided by the Soviet Congress of Representatives (meeting today). (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>New Russian Constitution Passed by the Soviet Congress</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The All-Union Congress of Soviets held a special meeting today and passed the new Soviet Constitution. The constitution was drafted by Stalin with the assistance of an advisory committee. However, after months of discussion by 250,000 people in meetings, the Central Executive Committee recently passed 13,721 amendments, involving multiple chapters and some articles. It is expected that the final draft will receive unanimous approval. The new constitution stipulates democratic elections and party governance, so it will elect a president and establish a Senate and a House of Representatives, both elected by secret direct ballot. Farmers and urban workers will enjoy the same voting rights. The constitution recognizes work as a basic right of every citizen and will recognize civil and property rights. The Senate will have 200 members, and the House of Representatives will have 600 members. (Reuter's, 25th)</p>
<h3>Renewed Conflict Between Japanese and Russian Troops, Japanese Puppet Troops Cross Border, Russia Protests</h3>
<p>(Changchun) At 3:30 PM on the 24th, forty Japanese soldiers, in the "Manchukuo" territory of 32 kilometers north of Danli on the eastern Soviet-Manchu border, clashed with forty Soviet soldiers with mortars. The damage on both sides and other details are unknown. (Domei, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Russian Foreign Ministry, due to the recent incursion of the Japanese-Manchu" troops into the Soviet Russian border, has lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Embassy in Russia today. According to the note from Soviet Russia to the Japanese Ambassador, yesterday at 5:00 PM, more than fifty Japanese-Manchu" troops crossed the border near the 20th boundary marker on the Russian-Manchu" border, invading half a mile into Soviet Russian territory and firing at Soviet Russian border guards, but were soon forced to retreat by the guards.

<h3>Situation in the Mediterranean Tightens, British Fleet Redeploys to Protect Merchant Shipping Safety, Italian Troops Build Defenses on Spanish Islands</h3>
<p>(London) The First Submarine Squadron of the British Mediterranean Fleet, consisting of nine submarines and the submarine tender HMS Cyclops, sailed from Malta. Today, there are widespread rumors that there will be significant changes in the deployment of British warships stationed in the Mediterranean. The British Admiralty issued a statement saying that the sailing of the Cyclops is merely a routine trip to Alicante to replace the British ship HMS Hulwich, and that no British submarines are sailing to Spanish waters. This rumor may have arisen because several submarines left port with the Cyclops for training exercises. These submarines will still return to their original berths. However, all British naval personnel in Malta are now forbidden to take leave. Tonight's naval climbing performance, intended to entertain the officers and men of the Turkish warship visiting the port, was also temporarily canceled. (Reuter's, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the Admiralty claimed today that the current naval deployment is of a routine nature, there is much speculation that it is related to the situation in Spain. Authoritative sources believe that this is related to Foreign Secretary Eden's statement that the protection of British merchant ships is essential. As for the deployment plan, the cruiser HMS Galatea and nine destroyers are scheduled to depart for Malta on Thursday to replace the cruiser HMS Arethusa, currently in Palma, and nine destroyers currently off the coast of Spain. The submarine Cyclops will sail to Malta tonight. At the same time, Soviet Russian Ambassador Maisky had a long conversation with Eden, reportedly discussing the Spanish rebel blockade of the Mediterranean. It is rumored here that Stalin is considering using the navy to protect Soviet Russian merchant ships. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the protection of French ships along the Spanish coast, responsible parties have stated that the French government's position is exactly the same as that of the United Kingdom. In other words, French ships within Spanish territorial waters (within three miles of the Spanish coast) should be subject to the jurisdiction of local authorities in accordance with international maritime law. However, outside of territorial waters, since neither side of the Spanish civil war has been recognized as a belligerent, French ships should not be subject to inspection. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Since the outbreak of the Spanish civil war, it has been rumored that Italian troops have landed on the Spanish Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean and built defenses. Regarding this, the Paris Echo's London correspondent recently reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini instructed Italian Ambassador Grandi to notify the British government, saying, "As long as the possibility of communism establishing an outpost base in the Catalan Autonomous Region (i.e., the establishment of a Soviet Republic in the Catalan Autonomous Region) exists, Italy should use certain locations in the Balearic Islands as a base for serious vigilance, but as soon as the Spanish National Army has definitively won, it should resolutely abandon it, because if Italy continues to maintain it, it will inevitably cause constant disputes in the Mediterranean." The Paris Echo's correspondent speculated on Italy's intentions, saying that if the Spanish civil war results in victory for the government forces, Italy will have a good excuse to occupy the Balearic Islands and disregard France. Italian diplomatic authorities are currently strongly urging the British government, saying that it is beneficial for Britain to assist the Spanish National Army government. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) There is much attention here to the rumor that Soviet Russia intends to use warships to escort merchant ships in Spanish territorial waters. If Soviet Russia implements this move, it may be seen as a challenge to Italy and Germany. At the same time, it is reported that Italy and Germany are preparing to openly intervene in the Spanish civil war. There is extreme concern here about German aid to the rebels. The rumor that Italy and Germany are rushing to transport munitions is also increasing instability. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Yugoslavia Negotiating Loan to Build Large-Scale Naval Port on the Adriatic Coast</h3>
<p>(Vienna) According to reliable sources here today, Yugoslavia has entered into loan negotiations with Britain for 400 million dinars to build a very large naval base on the Adriatic coast. It is reported that if unexpected events occur, the British Navy can also use the base. It is said that Prince Paul of Yugoslavia will soon go to London to personally negotiate. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Bombing Capital at Night, Fierce Street Fighting in University District, Government Forces Counterattack Taking Advantage</h3>
<p>Madrid was again hit by several shells in the city center last night, causing many deaths. The French Saint Louis Church was also among those destroyed. This night bombing terrified residents of the embassy, because the lights in the city have now been reduced to a very small number. In this darkness, the sound of explosions is often heard, which is heartbreaking. Street fighting is taking place in the university district between the two armies, as well as on the French Bridge and the former King's private garden, Casa del Campo. According to official statements, the fighting is in favor of the government forces. (Reuter's, 25th)</p>
<p>The artillery units belonging to the National Army in Madrid continued to bombard the city this month until 7:00 PM. Fighting continues in the western suburbs of the "French" bridge and the university district. The government forces' counterattack has been quite successful. The International Brigade (i.e., the volunteer corps organized by leftists from various countries) has besieged the western suburban hospital, which is currently defended by 2,000 members of the National Army. In addition, the government forces have also inflicted heavy losses on the National Army in the Casa de Campo Park area. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that a month ago, the Spanish government sent a submarine to patrol the straits, but it has not returned to its squadron since. It may have joined the National Army side. Diplomatic circles in London are now speculating that the submarine that attacked the government cruiser Cervantes may have been a deserter from the Spanish government navy. Therefore, the above rumors are increasingly credible. The Spanish government's claim that the cruiser was heavily damaged has also been confirmed by a telegram from the British destroyer HMS Grovehram, because the British ship witnessed a huge explosion on the Cervantes, which tilted and had to be towed into port for repairs. According to the Spanish government, the attacker of the Cervantes was a submarine belonging to a foreign country, indirectly referring to Italy and Germany, which has led to formal denials from Italy and Germany. (Reuter's, 25th)</p>
<h3>Rebel Fleet Blockades Gijón Port, Norwegian Ship Transporting Munitions Seized</h3>
<p>The National Army radio in Teneriffe, Canary Islands, broadcasted news stating, "A Norwegian merchant ship outside the port of Barcelona yesterday, carrying munitions to supply the government forces, was seized by a National Army warship. In addition, a Greek ship also carrying a large number of munitions was ordered by a National Army warship to sail to Ceuta in Spanish Morocco in North Africa (in the hands of the National Army). Currently, the National Army fleet has blockaded the northwestern port of Gijón (in the province of Asturias), and it is expected that an attack on the ports of Barcelona and Valencia will be launched sooner or later." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a broadcast from the Seville radio station today, the Spanish rebels have sunk several foreign merchant ships outside the port of Barcelona and will continue to prevent foreign ships from entering the port in the future. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>German Embassy in Xijing Searched, Munitions Found, German Nationals Forced to Leave City</h3>
<p>Madrid, the people's militia here today found three boxes of hand grenades, several rifles, machine guns, and pistols at the German embassy and arrested dozens of people, mostly Spanish refugees. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then informed the German embassy that although Germany and Italy have recognized the rebel government, nationals of the two countries are still residing at the Madrid embassy and that they should leave the country within 24 hours, and the embassy building should be permanently closed. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid, according to news from the port of Cartagena in the southeast, police investigations have recently discovered that the German National Socialist Party has a large-scale espionage and propaganda agency, and it is known that the German consulate there has also become a munitions depot. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Proposal to Demarcate Neutral Zone Rejected by Spanish Government</h3>
<p>Valencia, the International Red Cross recently proposed to both sides of the Spanish civil war to demarcate a neutral zone in the city of Madrid, with both sides guaranteeing its safety. Foreign Minister Del Vayo recently telegraphed General Miaja, chairman of the Madrid Defense Committee, rejecting the proposal, saying, "If the government were to approve the demarcation of a neutral zone, it would be tantamount to acknowledging that the rebels' bombing of civilians outside the zone is legitimate, which is unacceptable." (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Peace Conference Sympathizes with Spanish Government</h3>
<p>The Pan-American Peace Conference in the capital of Argentina recently telegraphed Spanish President Azana, saying that the current government of Spain represents the people of the whole country, and it is a legal government that is fighting to protect the rights of the people, which is admirable.

<h3>Hungarian Regent Arrives in Rome, Receives Warm Welcome from Italian Government and Public, This Trip Related to Overall Central European Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy arrived here today to hold meetings with Italian authorities, which will have a significant impact on the overall situation in Central Europe. He was warmly welcomed by the King and Queen of Italy and Prime Minister Mussolini upon his arrival today. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Three Hungarian dignitaries, Regent Horthy, Prime Minister Darányi, and Foreign Minister Kánya, arrived here together today for a formal return visit. Horthy's wife and daughter also accompanied him. The King of Italy, Mussolini, and other dignitaries came to the station to greet them. When the welcoming party and the distinguished guests traveled by car from the station to the Quirinal Palace, the crowds gathered outside the station were immense, cheering endlessly. Troops were lined up along the route, and the crowds watching the cars pass also cheered enthusiastically. The group was protected by the Guards Regiment and proceeded grandly to the Quirinal Palace. Upon arrival, tens of thousands of people in front of the palace also expressed their warm welcome. The guests, constantly greeted by cheers, stepped onto the palace porch and nodded to thank the crowd, whereupon the crowd cheered even more enthusiastically. The flags of both Italy and Hungary were visible everywhere in Rome today, and texts welcoming the distinguished guests were posted everywhere. When the guests arrived at the Italian border, representatives of the Italian government boarded the train to welcome them and accompanied them to Rome. When the train arrived in Florence, a committee of the King of Italy boarded the train to pay their respects. (Reuter's, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) After arriving here, Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy reviewed the Italian army units on the "Imperial Avenue" this morning. In addition to the 25,000 members of the capital garrison, there were also troops stationed in various provinces and units belonging to the indigenous troops of Libya and Askari in Africa. Representatives of national fascist groups also participated in the parade. The King of Italy and Admiral Horthy, both wearing naval admiral uniforms, rode abreast on horseback. Upon their arrival, all the officers and soldiers participating in the parade and the spectators cheered in salute. Several Hungarian officers followed the Admiral, all fully armed, followed by a team of soldiers wearing helmets and armor, whose attire was extremely magnificent. The review ceremony lasted an hour. According to the report by a radio announcer, "This is the first time since the Treaty of Trianon (i.e., the Treaty with Hungary) was concluded after the European War that other countries have offered Hungary comfort with a solemn and grand ceremony."

<h3>Nobel Peace Prize Awarded to Ossietzky, German Authorities Consider it an Insult</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the Nobel Peace Prize Committee awarding the previous Peace Prize to the famous German pacifist writer Ossietzky, the official gazette announced at 9:15 PM tonight, stating, "Ossietzky is a notorious rebel who was sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment for treason on November 23, 1931, and sent to prison in May 1932. Although he requested a pardon from the late President Hindenburg at that time, it was rejected. The Nobel Peace Prize Committee is now awarding the Peace Prize to such a traitor, which is an insult to the new Germany and a provocation that is intolerable. The German government will soon make a public announcement to clearly respond." The gazette also stated that the Soviet government often imposes the death penalty on political enemies, while Germany only confined Ossietzky to a concentration camp and recently released him, which is truly generous. According to the phrasing of this gazette, it was decided after consultation between the local authorities and Führer Hitler. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Committee Member Lei Zoulu's Criminal Facts: Colluding with Bandits, Hiding Weapons, Embezzling Funds, Engaging in Smuggling; Evidence Confirmed After Repeated Interrogations</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Lei Zoulu, manager of Xiamen Yi Nan Qian Zhuang [Money House] and supervisor of the Chamber of Commerce, was arrested by the Xiamen Public Security Bureau on the order of the Provincial Security Department at approximately 2:00 AM on the 16th of this month. He was immediately escorted to the Security Department and has been interrogated several times. Lei is from Nan'an and was a former subordinate of Chen Guohui. Chen rose from the militia and moved around southern Fujian, western Fujian, Quanzhou, Yongchun, Xinglong, and finally commanded the First Mixed Brigade of the Provincial Defense Force, consisting of four regiments and one independent battalion, totaling more than 8,000 men. In 1930, they were stationed in Quanzhou, Yongchun, and Xinglong, making them the largest and strongest militia force in Fujian Province. In 1932, Chen was detained and executed by the 19th Route Army. During that time, Lei was in charge of finance. After Chen's death, Lei claimed to be a wealthy man in Xiamen. This time, he was reported by Chen Guohui's former subordinates, including Chen Peiyu, the current commander of the First Security Regiment, Peng Tang, the recently discharged commander of the Ninth Regiment, and Chen Yucai, a consultant to the provincial government, along with fourteen others. Chen, Peng, and Chen were the former regimental commanders under Chen Guohui, and the rest were battalion commanders. After interrogations by the Security Department, the following four accusations have been confirmed: (1) Colluding with bandits: Chen Weijin, a former battalion commander under Guohui, refused to be incorporated into the regular army and formed the "Black Shirt Party" in Quanzhou, with backing from a certain quarter. Lei was actually one of the instigators. After Chen Weijin and his brother Weige were exposed, the authorities issued arrest warrants. Weijin fled to Tokyo, Japan, and Lei helped him obtain a passport. Weige hid in Lei's home for several months last year. When the Ninth Division searched, Xie Brigade discovered that most of Lei's clansmen were on the Black Shirt Party list. (2) Hiding weapons: When Guohui was detained by Jiang Guangnai in the province, Lei transported and hid some of his weapons. (3) Embezzling funds: Funds belonging to the public, specifically those intended for the purchase of German weapons when Guohui was alive. The first batch was allocated through apportioned tax deeds, and the funds were paid by Lei, which was settled. The second batch was allocated through opium seedling donations. The weapons were not delivered, and Chen had already been detained, so Lei embezzled the funds, amounting to more than one million yuan. Chen Peiyu and others were regimental commanders under Guohui at the time and knew the details very well. (4) Guohui's private property was all in Lei's hands, deposited in Yi Nan Qian Zhuang. After Chen's death, Lei forged accounts and secretly changed old accounts, embezzling Chen's movable and immovable property. (5) Engaging in smuggling: Lei colluded with foreigners in Xiamen to secretly organize an agency with a capital of more than one million yuan, specializing in the smuggling of opium, morphine, and other drugs and valuable private goods. The agency was located somewhere in Xiamen. This year, the Anti-Smoking Investigation Department intercepted smugglers, who threw a large batch of raw opium into the sea, which was later recovered. It was the goods sunk by this smuggling agency. The circumstances of this accusation are serious, not only involving collusion with foreigners and tax evasion but also endangering the Republic of China. The Security Department has dispatched personnel for secret investigations. While a final verdict has not been reached regarding his collusion with bandits, hiding weapons, and embezzling public and private funds, the evidence of witnesses and material evidence is already conclusive. Furthermore, Lei recently purchased foreign exchange with a large sum of money, which was remitted to a certain special place, which has also attracted the special attention of the Security Department.

<h3>After the Completion of the Huangpu Branch Line, the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways Will Be Connected; The Location Has Been Determined</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The construction of the Huangpu branch line of the Yuehan Railway was originally a precursor to connecting the Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways. This matter is of great importance to China's transportation and economy, and it has attracted considerable attention both domestically and internationally. The survey of the Huangpu branch line began in September, under the responsibility of Li Guojun, Deputy Director of the Yuehan Railway Engineering Office. The survey was completed by the end of October. The entire line is 26 miles long, and the construction cost is estimated at 1.6 million yuan in national currency. The Ministry of Railways has ordered it to be completed within three months. The rails and other materials for the entire line have also been ordered from abroad and are expected to arrive by the end of this year. The branch line starts from Xicun Station, follows a curved route around the outskirts of Guangzhou, passes through Dabeimenwai, Guihuagang, Tianpingjia, Dashe, crosses Tangshang, builds an arched bridge over the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway line, and ends at Yuzhu Fort in Huangpu. The civilian land that needs to be acquired along the way is as follows: Yaotai, Mapenggang, Gaoyao Yishan, Sihui Yishan, Jiulonggang, Hushan, Xiaoxizhu, Qixinggang, Zheshao Yishan, Fujian Yishan, Xiaojinchai, Dajinchai, Taojinkeng, Chixi Yishan, Enping Yishan, Boluo Yishan, Zheng'ergang, Dabao Furnace, Hunan Yishan, Aiyutang Yishan, HuiJiao Cemetery, etc. The determined route has been marked with red flags and white lime marks on the 15th. The person responsible for presiding over the project is Liu Baoshan, an engineer from the Zhushao section. The surveying team leader, Li Yaoxiang, has completed the surveying of each section. The first section is 10 miles long, starting from behind the cement factory at Xicun Station and heading northwest, passing through Guihuagang, Jiulong Temple, Hengji Gang, and Taojinshabeng, ending at Yantang Police Academy. The construction of this section will be put out for public bidding, with Huang Tianji and Tongyi Construction Company submitting the lowest bids, and they will be contracted to build it. On the 14th, the Guangzhou Municipal Government announced that the land and cemeteries along the route must be registered and declared before the 25th and reclaimed by the state. All graves must also be relocated before the 25th, or the Railway Bureau will relocate them on their behalf. Construction of the first section will begin on the 26th and must be completed, with sleepers and rails laid, within two months. The second section, 16 miles long, will be put out for bidding after the engineers complete the survey. The Guangzhou-Kowloon and Yuehan Railways will be connected at Genggulou in Tangshang. The connection project must be completed within two months. However, the two railways will not be formally connected, but the Huangpu branch line will connect them in fact, enabling through transportation. It is also reported that the two railways are expected to be open to traffic starting next spring.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Interchange of Prosecutors Between Songhu and Shanghai</h3>

It is reported that the handover will take place at the end of the month. Mr. Zhu is currently in the process of handing over his duties.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Hiring a Chief Compiler for the Local Chronicle</h3>
<p>The Jiading County New Chronicle Preparatory Committee, believing that the outline of the new chronicle has been formulated and compilation should begin immediately, and having included the funds for the bureau in this year's local budget, which has been approved by the provincial government, has now hired Huang Shizuo, former Chief Compiler of the Supplement to the Jiading County Chronicle and former District Chief of the First District, as the Chief Compiler. It is reported that the bureau will be established in the Lu Qingxian Ancestral Hall and will be formally established in the near future.</p>
<h3>General Mobilization for Supporting Suiyuan</h3>

Educational personnel will donate at least one day's salary per person, and students from various primary and secondary schools and people's schools will be responsible for soliciting donations under the leadership of their leaders. The funds will be collected and remitted to the Farmers Bank within two weeks for transfer to the Shenbao [newspaper] for delivery.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Large Quantities of Grain Leaving the Country</h3>
<p>Wuxi is a hub for the collection of grain. Every year during the autumn harvest, buyers from various provinces gather here. This year's autumn harvest was abundant, but prices remain firm because people are buying in large quantities and secretly exporting it. Among them, the amount transported by freight cars from the Wuxi train station is often two or three cars per day. In the past week, 1,300 to 1,400 tons have been shipped out, reportedly to Xuzhou, Jinan, and other places, with Xuzhou being the most. From Xuzhou, the goods are unloaded and transferred to trains on the Longhai Railway for transportation to Tongguan to meet the needs of the people in Shaanxi. Currently, there are still 400 to 500 tons of rice stored in Wuxi warehouses waiting to be loaded onto trains. Once the passport procedures are completed, the rice will be shipped out. However, the import of coarse grains for sale in Wuxi is quite congested, and even the warehouses are difficult to accommodate. The stationmaster Wang is looking for another open space to store them.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Arresting a Suspected Traitor</h3>
<p>At approximately 10:00 AM on the 24th, a man speaking with a northern accent, leaning on a wooden cane, and wearing ragged clothes suddenly came to the Dacheng Yarn Factory outside the Dananmen in Wuyi. He carried a large package and came to the factory to buy cloth. He was then rejected by the factory staff, who informed him that the factory's cloth was not sold retail. However, the man lingered and looked around. The factory found his behavior suspicious and immediately ordered someone to take him to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. After questioning, he stated his name was Zhu Xingliang, 42 years old, from Kaifeng, Henan. He had come to Changzhou from Shandong the day before to buy cloth, and the rest of his words were evasive. The bureau chief, Si Daoping, suspected him of being a major traitor and immediately prepared a document to send him to the county bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin: Walder Succumbs to Illness Due to Overwork</h3>
<p>Walder, the founder of the Dongwai Gospel Hospital, came to Cheng in 1895 and has been here for 42 years. Walder was an expert in gynecology in the United States and has treated countless people in Cheng. He had a very good relationship with the local people. After returning to his country last summer, because he was old (currently 69 years old), relatives advised him not to come to Cheng. However, out of enthusiasm for medical work, he returned to Cheng again this autumn. The day before yesterday (21st), due to excessive mental work, his stomach illness flared up. He went to Shanghai Hong'en Hospital for treatment, but he passed away at 6:00 PM on the 22nd. All circles in Jiangyin were extremely saddened by the news. A memorial service was scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 24th. Walder's coffin will also be transported to Cheng for burial.</p>

The district office arrested the perpetrators, Yang Xuan and Shen Wu, and handed them over to the court for interrogation and detention. This case involved a crime of passion.</p>
<h3>Donations from All Sectors to Console the Troops</h3>
<p>Various circles in Nantong have been implementing a one-day movement for days, donating funds to console the front-line soldiers in Suiyuan Province. On the 25th, all donations were combined and remitted. Male and female prisoners in the Fourth Prison and detention center also fasted for three days and donated the savings for consolation expenses.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang: Long-Distance Bus Accident</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Zhencheng line, business has been very developed. More than a dozen round trips are made every day, including local buses, which is convenient for travelers. At 12:10 on the 24th, a long-distance bus No. 2540 from Benniu to Menghe was driven by driver Yan Tiansheng. The driver's skills were very poor. According to the schedule, he could reach Menghe Station at 13:00, but he was delayed until 14:20. When he was 26 kilometers away from Menghe, on the way to Picheng, in Yaoxiang, there was a small cart on the right side of the road with a woman sitting on it, pushed forward in the same direction by a carter around 50 years old. The bus driver did not give a warning signal at a distance of 20 meters. The small cart did not have time to avoid and was hit by the bus. The bus driver panicked and turned the steering wheel to the left. The momentum was too strong, causing the car body to fall into the ditch, with all four wheels facing the sky. All 28 passengers in the car (all male) were seriously injured, and most of them were bleeding. Nearby villagers heard the sound and went to see, rescuing the injured and taking them to Yaoxiang, trying to find ways to return home and seek medical treatment. Shen and Mao, two of the injured, came to Zhenjiang. It is reported that the management office, after receiving the report, has sent personnel to investigate the cause of the accident and handle the aftermath.</p>

Many people attended. Yu Peiren presided over the meeting and designated 47 names of agencies and legal entities to form the committee. It was also decided that the funds from the one-day income would be handed over to the Central Bank for transfer, and donations from all sectors would be transferred by the Bank of Communications. In addition, the conference telegraphed condolences to the soldiers at the front. The committee will be convened in the near future to discuss the progress.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Reorganization of the Highway Department</h3>
<p>The highways in Zhejiang Province have been divided into three districts, each managed by a management office. In order to save expenses, concentrate power, and facilitate coordination, it has been decided to make slight changes to the organization. The responsibilities of each management office have been redefined. Each district will be divided into ten road sections based on the size of the jurisdiction, and each section will have a manager responsible for management. All personnel have been internally determined and will be announced soon. The general affairs, operations, and accounting sections in each district management office will be abolished, and only an accounting office will be established. All remaining personnel will be transferred to work in the province. The changes will take effect on December 1st.</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Regarding the case of Li Gongpu, Wang Zaoshi, Shi Liang, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Shen Junru, Zou Taofen, and other seven individuals who were arrested and interrogated, the Shanghai Municipal Government officially announced the reasons for their arrest and the measures taken as follows yesterday: Since illegally organizing the so-called "Shanghai All Circles National Salvation Association," Li Gongpu and others, under the guise of national salvation, have wantonly fabricated rumors, with the sole intention of weakening the people's faith in the government. Recently, they have even colluded with the Red bandits, recklessly advocating a People's Front, inciting class conflicts, and further advocating the overthrow of the National Government and the reorganization of the National Defense Government. All sorts of absurd claims can be verified. The government authorities have been exceedingly tolerant and patiently persuaded them for over a year, but they have shown no awareness whatsoever and have even moved from words to actions, secretly plotting and inciting a general strike in Shanghai to achieve their attempt to disrupt public order and subvert the government. Solid evidence of this has been found. Now, at a critical juncture in pacifying the borders and suppressing bandits, the rear must be consolidated. Emergency measures must be taken to curb the emerging chaos. With the national crisis so grave, it is precisely the time for the entire nation to work together. We must not allow a small number of extremist elements to act recklessly. After Li and others are arrested, they will be investigated according to the law. There are still Communist Party members lurking within the National Salvation Association. Separate personnel have been dispatched, together with the Municipal Party Department, to conduct a thorough investigation to eliminate the traitors. In short, the Municipal Government has the responsibility to maintain public order. It cannot bear to see hundreds of thousands of workers misled and displaced by these individuals, nor can it allow a city with over three million people to fall into a state of disorder due to their conspiracies and incitement.</p>

We attacked from both sides in a fierce battle throughout the night, finally defeating the enemy. This morning at 9:00 AM, our troops completely occupied Bailingmiao. I report, Yan Xishan." (2) Chuan Zuoyi telegraphed that in recent days, the bandit army used hundreds of motor vehicles to actively reinforce troops towards Bailingmiao.

Our cavalry division commander Sun Duosheng and infantry brigade commander Sun Lanfeng directed their troops and the supplementary Liu regiment of the 70th division to counterattack and also sent a surprise force to encircle Bailingmiao. After a fierce battle for ten hours, with repeated hand-to-hand combat seven times, the bandits were completely defeated. This morning at 9:00 AM, we occupied Bailingmiao. The bandits suffered 700-800 casualties, over 300 were captured, and three cannons, five heavy machine guns, over 400 rifles, three radio stations, and countless ammunition and provisions were seized.

However, the crisis is not over, and the worries are not gone. The great national war of resistance has only just begun. The heroic sacrifices that will be made hereafter are just beginning. Our soldiers at the front need full support, which is becoming increasingly urgent. The weather outside the Great Wall is bitterly cold, and fingers are falling off. Compared to the spirit of the soldiers at the front, who are experiencing extraordinary hardships, what is the life of our bank employees? I believe that a heroic national war requires the mobilization of the entire people to support it, saving money on food and clothing, and enthusiastically contributing to supply the troops and boost morale. Our colleagues, bearing in mind the responsibility of every individual, have voluntarily collected 700 yuan in national currency and sent it to the Jiangsu Bank for remittance.

<h3>News from Tokyo: Sino-British Alliance is Groundless - Spokesperson of the Chinese Government Denies Rumors to Reuters</h3>
<p>Reuters, 25th [of the month], local news: Political figures here were quite surprised today to learn that Tokyo is widely spreading rumors that China and Britain are currently negotiating a mutual defense alliance. According to reports, this news was published by the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, based on a report from a correspondent stationed in Shanghai. The news also stated that Hong Kong Governor Sir Geoffrey Northcote and Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China and standing member of the National Economic Council, are also engaged in negotiations on an agreement whereby Britain would build a railway across Hainan Island and exploit various mines in South China. Tonight, a spokesperson for the Chinese government, when met by a Reuters reporter, solemnly denied the above and called it an unreasonable journalistic fantasy. The spokesperson also said, "The relationship between China and Britain has recently become more sincere, which has been further enhanced since the visit of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, to China. Britain clearly hopes that China can fulfill its responsibility for national revival and will provide China with all legitimate assistance within its power. However, the talk of an alliance between China and Britain is absurd. It must be understood that China does not want to form an alliance with any country and is currently refusing to be pressured by other countries to form an alliance against Soviet Russia. What we want is to be allowed to seek our own way to save the country."</p>
<h3>Active Grain Market - Shanghai Merchants Express Satisfaction with Food Regulation Measures</h3>
<p>The issue of food exports has caused panic in various regions dependent on supplies from other provinces due to the sequential prohibition by grain-producing provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hunan. Shanghai grain merchants took the lead in requesting the central government to lift the ban. The central government, considering the importance of grain to the people's livelihood, carefully considered the matter and decided through a meeting of the Executive Yuan that provinces should not prohibit grain exports, in line with the original intention of regulating food within the country. The issue of exports is also temporarily not prohibited. Since the promulgation of this measure, the grain market in this city has become active, and prices have risen. According to the Shanghai grain merchants, this year's autumn harvest is bountiful. If all grain-producing provinces uniformly prohibit exports, it will inevitably lead to low grain prices harming farmers, and areas that do not produce grain will panic. As a result, foreign rice will take advantage of the situation. This year, domestic imports of foreign rice have reached over one million loads, with Guangdong accounting for the vast majority. In the past, Guangdong was politically restricted, and very little grain from neighboring provinces was transported there. Now that Guangdong's politics are under the central government, grain from provinces such as Hunan and Jiangxi will be transported there, and it is expected that foreign rice will be further reduced in the future. As for exports, Shanghai and Tianjin are the main ports. Currently, Shanghai grain merchants are also supervising each other to reduce exports significantly. If unscrupulous merchants attempt to profit from this, the authorities can also crack down on them at any time.</p>

He immediately met with Finance Minister Kong to discuss everything.</p>

<h3>Sha Qianli and Zou Taofen Continue Interrogation Yesterday - Sha Transferred to Municipal Public Security Bureau - Zou and Zhang Sent Back into Custody - Rushing to Find Shi Liang to Bring to Justice</h3>
<p>Lawyer Sha Qianli, suspected of a certain crime, was arrested with the assistance of the Public Concession Police at the request of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with Li Gongpu, Shen Junru, and Wang Zaoshi, and sent to the Second Branch of the Higher Court. The issue of the two (Li and Wang) has been resolved, and the details have been reported in this [newspaper]. Regarding Sha's part, because evidence needs to be investigated, he was interrogated again yesterday afternoon. Yesterday afternoon, Yu Hua, the President of the Second Branch of the Higher Court, accompanied by the two prosecutors, Zhou and Xiao, and the prosecutor, Chen [ ], took the seat in the Criminal Court No. 1 to continue the interrogation. After deliberation by President Yu, he immediately took the seat and ruled that Sha Qianli, along with the evidence, be transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Shi Liang, a female lawyer from Changzhou, residing at No. [ ] Lane, Rue Lafayette, and Zou Taofen, residing at No. 4, Lane 601, Rue Lafayette, and Zhang Naiqi, residing at No. 24, Cihui Village, Avenue Joffre, were all arrested at their residences on the night of the 22nd by the authorities who ordered the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to prepare documents and dispatch personnel to cooperate with the French Police Department due to suspicion of political actions and inciting unrest. The next day, they were transferred to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court for trial and ruling. It was ordered that Zou and Zhang each provide a guarantee from a continuous-operation store, and Shi provide a guarantee from a store that she would be available whenever summoned, and that the trial be postponed to the 28th. They were also temporarily released on bail and entrusted to their defense lawyers, with a guarantee form to be provided at a later date. On the 24th, the Third Branch of the Higher Court received an official letter from the Municipal Public Security Bureau stating that the defendants' case was serious and that there was a risk of escape. Therefore, another warrant was issued, and the police were dispatched to summon each defendant. However, because all three defendants were not at home or at their lawyers' offices, none of them was summoned. At 6:00 PM, Zou Taofen received the news and voluntarily reported to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The defense lawyers for Shi and Zhang also arrived and waited for instructions. The court was immediately opened for interrogation and ordered Zou to be temporarily detained in the police room. The defense lawyers for Shi and Zhang were ordered to bring Shi and Zhang to the court before 12:00 that night. Only Zhang Naiqi arrived at the appointed time. Shi Liang had gone to Suzhou for business and did not arrive. After the results of the trial were reported, it was ordered that Zou and Zhang be detained in the detention center. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the court was opened again for continued trial. The presiding judge and prosecutors retreated to the rest room for deliberation. After ten minutes, they returned to the court and ruled that the defendants in this case be transferred to the prosecutors of this court for verification and ordered lawyers Tang and Zhang to quickly find Shi Liang and bring her to justice. The court adjourned at 7:15 PM.</p>

<h3>The Henan Province Drought is Extremely Severe: Chang Zhizhen Arrives in Shanghai to Request Relief, Hoping All Sectors Will Contribute Generously</h3>
<p>Since the autumn of this year, there has been scant rainfall, and all areas have reported severe drought. Following years of banditry and floods, Henan Province has suffered exceptionally heavy disasters, with the affected area reaching over seventy counties. Although the provincial government is making every effort to provide relief, it is like adding a cup of water to a cartload of burning fuel, of no help at all. Therefore, Chang Zhizhen, the Director of the Provincial Department of Finance and Chairman of the Relief Committee, went south to Beijing to request assistance and came to Shanghai to appeal to all sectors. Last night, the Henan Association in Shanghai, represented by Zhang Wuqin and lawyer Jiang Yiping, invited the press to meet with him. During the meeting, Chang reported on the disaster situation and the relief efforts. The following is a record of what he said:</p>
<p>Extraordinarily Severe Disaster Situation</p>
<p>Chang reported that Henan Province is unfortunate, with disasters occurring frequently. Since the eighteenth year of the Republic [1929], first bandits and drought caused disaster, with epidemics and plagues following, severely depleting the vitality of the area. Then came floods, such as the simultaneous floods of the Yi, Luo, Sha, and Ying Rivers in the twentieth year [1931], causing great damage. Furthermore, there was the breach of the Yellow River at Fenglou in the twenty-second year [1933], and the collapse of the Huang embankment at Guantai Mengzhuang in the twenty-third year [1934], scattering the people and leaving them homeless, many of whom have still not returned to their villages. In these past few years, there has been no year without disaster, and no disaster that was not severe. The rural economy has been exhausted, and people are in constant hardship, their homes bare, living in dire straits. Fortunately, the central and provincial governments have distributed funds and shown benevolence, and various charitable organizations and philanthropists have generously donated to help. This association has exhausted its humble efforts to provide relief, barely managing to overcome this life-or-death crisis. Unfortunately, Heaven has not been kind, and misfortune has struck again. This year, the rains came at the wrong time, and the wheat harvest was poor. A severe drought has plagued the area since the summer, and autumn crops have not been fully planted. To this day, not a drop of rain has fallen, the fields are cracked, and grain has not been sown, with the drought continuing unabated. Now, it is followed by disasters such as locusts and hail. The unplanted land is already barren for miles, and the remaining crops have been devoured. Widespread suffering is unbearable to witness. According to statistics, sixty-four counties, including Lanfeng, have reported drought, three counties, including Mi County, have reported drought and hail, five counties, including Yanshi, have reported drought and locusts, Neixiang County has reported hail, and Hua County has reported locusts, totaling seventy-four counties. The disaster area accounts for two-thirds of the entire province, with thirty-two counties, including Yu County, being the most severely affected. The extent of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster are truly unprecedented.</p>
<p>The Process of Requesting Relief</p>
<p>The relief committee established in this province is currently consulting with the provincial government to jointly discuss and plan relief efforts. It has been found that the province's disaster relief reserve fund is only listed at 100,000 yuan. According to regulations, only half of this can be used. However, given the particularly severe disaster situation this year, the entire amount has already been allocated, including 30,000 yuan for emergency relief, 20,000 yuan for price stabilization of grain, 20,000 yuan for the Kaifeng porridge factory, 20,000 yuan for agricultural loans to counties along the Luotong road, and 10,000 yuan for work relief in Zhoujiakou. Using such a small amount to provide relief to more than 9.7 million disaster victims in seventy-four counties, half of whom cannot survive without relief, is clearly a drop in the bucket and of no help at all. It is obvious that this is not enough. The relief projects of this association are divided into emergency relief, work relief, loan relief, grain loans, price stabilization, clothing distribution, and porridge distribution, among other items. We have done our best, but funds are needed everywhere. At a time when the rural economy is bankrupt and the social economy is depressed, fundraising is truly not easy. Therefore, I have come south to request assistance. In Beijing, I paid respects to the financial authorities and was granted 250,000 yuan in public bonds. I also requested an additional 50,000 yuan from the Executive Yuan, totaling 300,000 yuan, which can be used to offset 180,000 yuan in current expenses. The Agricultural and Commercial Bank has also agreed to allocate 700,000 to 800,000 yuan for loan relief. The Ministry of Finance has also ordered the Central, China, Communications, China, and Farmers banks to provide low-interest loans in the province, totaling about 400,000 yuan, to aid in relief efforts. I have come to Shanghai to request assistance from all sectors. However, with the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan Province, all sectors have already generously contributed. The disaster situation in this province may not be noticed by all sectors. It is hoped that they will consider the millions of dying compatriots and the importance of Henan Province in national defense and generously donate to save the people from disaster and restore the people's strength. This is what the compatriots in the disaster area are eagerly awaiting.</p>
<h3>Donations from All Sectors for Aircraft Purchase</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Bankers Association held its 28th Executive Committee meeting of the 3rd session at 2:00 PM yesterday. Eleven committee members attended, with Shao Yanshan presiding.

(2) The Standing Committee proposed that the collection of income tax on interest income from deposits be implemented from January 1, 1937, which is imminent.

(Resolution) Notify the industry that all deposits and other items be settled at the end of this year. (3) The Income Tax Research Association proposed that the first type of income tax be levied from the start of the 1937 business year for each industry. Is this feasible? A public resolution was requested for discussion. (Resolution) Reserved. (4) The Income Tax Research Association proposed that, internally, members should pay attention to the following points: (1) Accounting subjects must be reorganized; (2) Preparation of balance sheets and other documents; (3) Numbering of accounts and annotation of deposit slips and vouchers. Detailed reasons for the above three points were given. Is this feasible? A public resolution was requested for discussion. (Resolution) Publicly request Mr. Hongsheng to draft an outline of accounting subjects, (2) and (3) to be clearly marked and then reviewed. (5) The Category D Income Tax forms issued by the Ministry of Finance should be made available for use by all firms. Should these forms be printed by the association for the use of each firm, or should each firm make its own copies? A public resolution was requested for discussion. (Resolution) The association will make copies.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Inland River Machine Factory Officially Resumes Operations: Trial Run on the 20th of this Month; Jianghan Factory Sold to China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>After the China Merchants Bureau's inland river machine factory was ordered to move to Hankou, the Ministry of Transportation appointed Zhou Houkun, Deputy Director of the Shipping Department of the bureau, as the supervising commissioner for the factory's re-establishment. Zhou arrived in Hankou and actively made arrangements. Yesterday, a report arrived in Shanghai stating that all the machinery in the inland river machine factory had been installed and the factory had officially resumed operations with a trial run on the 20th of this month. All the arrangements and installation costs amounted to 4,000 yuan. All the factory employees have also arrived, and the monthly salary requirement is 600 yuan, which should be allocated and paid by the China Merchants Bureau's branch office in Hankou for convenience. In the future, Yangtze River ships will not need to go downstream to Shanghai for repairs, and can be repaired upstream in Hankou. Furthermore, the Jianghan Machine and Shipbuilding Factory in Hankou is very willing to sell to the China Merchants Bureau and merge into state-owned operations. Negotiations have been held many times, and the Bureau has sent personnel to inspect the factory many times. Now that the Inland River Factory has moved to Hankou and resumed operations, the Han Factory has decided to sell to the China Merchants Bureau and has sent the entire list of assets to Shanghai, listing over 51,000 yuan for the factory site and assets, 46,000 yuan for the Jiangxing ship, and over 110,800 yuan in total for shipbuilding machinery, engines, and debts owed by shipping companies.

<h3>Zhang Zhongli Flies Back to Shanghai to Discuss the Reorganization of the Salt Police</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Zhang Zhongli, Director of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Tax Police Bureau, flew to Guangzhou on the Guangdong aircraft on the Shanghai-Guangdong line on the 12th of this month under the orders of the Salt Affairs Inspection Headquarters to assist the Liangguang Inspection Office in reorganizing the Tax Police. Having completed his mission, he flew back to Shanghai yesterday on the Fujian aircraft to report. A reporter met him at his residence and inquired about his trip. According to Zhang, he was ordered to assist in the reorganization of the Liangguang Tax Police. After arriving in Guangzhou, he paid a visit to Tang Xuan, the manager of the Liangguang Inspection Office and Salt Transport Commissioner. He then inspected the Tax Police Section, the Salt Police Training Institute, and the salt fields in Dunbai, Haifeng County, the hometown of Chen Jiongming, as well as Biji, Dazhou, and Danshui in Huizhou. He conveyed the ideas of Chief Superintendent De Yi to the salt police, special police, and the Haiwei and Nuli patrol ships at all times, stating that the tax police should operate under the leadership of the inspection office, abide by salt regulations and tax police regulations, understand their responsibilities, recognize the system, respect order, observe discipline, diligently study, strive to fulfill their duties, suppress smuggling, enrich taxes, and protect the people. He also stated that they should completely eliminate the past bad habits of eating private funds, releasing private goods, transporting smuggled goods, and disturbing the people. Those who have made contributions will be promoted and rewarded, and those who have committed crimes will be punished according to the law, without concealment or leniency. All officers and police were able to understand. He then discussed with Commissioner Tang and Deputy Manager Zhang (Xiaowen) and Inspection Director Zhao (Junmai) and Tax Police Section Chief Huang (Ming) to combine the above police into seven districts and sixty-seven teams of tax police, stationed in Shantou, Shanwei, Guangzhou, Yangjiang, Meilu, Baishichang, Sanya Field, and other key points along the coast to be responsible for suppressing smuggling. Guangdong has a total of Dunbai, Biji, Dazhou, Shiqiao, Danshui, Dianmao, Bomao, Wushi, Baishi, Shuang'en, Sanya, Haishan, Dongjie, Huilai, Zhaolong, and fifteen fields, which can produce six to seven million dan of salt annually, selling to seven provinces, including Liangguang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Hunan, and Jiangxi. The annual tax revenue can be two to three million yuan. However, in the past, the Salt Commissioner held sole power and engaged in private gain and corruption. Private salt was rampant everywhere, and the annual salt tax revenue was only eight to nine million yuan. Since the Inspection Office took over, Chief Inspector Zeng (Yangfeng), Section Chief Wen (Yingxing), and Supervising Inspector Yang (Xingqin) have visited Guangdong to provide guidance. All three major fields of Sanya, Wushi, and Dunbai have built salt mounds, and salt farmers have complied with regulations and paid storage fees. Recently, tax revenues have reached 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan per month, gradually improving and expected to double. He also visited Commander Yu and the chiefs of the Huangpu Military Camp, the Provincial Government, and the Departments of Civil Affairs and Finance, conveying the thanks of Chief Zhu (Tingqi). All expressed their willingness to assist. The results of this trip were satisfactory. He also made a stopover to visit Fujian Salt Affairs to investigate the situation. Zhang also stated that since Committee Member Song (Ziwen) arrived in Hong Kong, the Guangdong economy has been booming, and people are exchanging cash for banknotes at the Provincial Bank in droves, a scene of unprecedented prosperity.</p>

<h3>Overview of the Mutual Aid Work of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>The suffering of rickshaw pullers is known to all. However, their greatest suffering is that once they become ill and unable to pull a rickshaw, their family's livelihood is no longer secure. Elderly and weak individuals are neither suitable for pulling rickshaws nor have the strength to return to their hometown to change careers. The livelihood of their entire family is often on the verge of desperation. If a family member dies, they lack the funds for burial. If they encounter a fire, the entire family is left with nothing. Such situations are truly indescribable. The Shanghai Public Concession Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, recognizing this situation, established a Mutual Aid Department when it was established two years ago. In addition to handling medical and health insurance and other businesses, it is specifically responsible for relief. If a member or their immediate family suffers an unfortunate event, such as the aforementioned illness, old age, burial, fire, and loans, the department provides appropriate and practical assistance. All procedures are streamlined as much as possible. The following is a special record for the reference of those engaged in social welfare work:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Work</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the association has established a Mutual Aid Committee by the Board of Directors. Last year, it appointed Zhu Maocheng, Jin Runxiang, Maixi, Wang Zhiren, and Chou Zitong, and seven others as members of the Mutual Aid Committee, with Zhu Maocheng as chairman. Zhang Dengying, the general manager of the association, also serves as the secretary, deliberating on all matters to be handled. Currently, the department has handled five relief works, with the following five types: (1) Giving rice: Members who are unable to pull a rickshaw due to illness, as well as those who have experienced unexpected disasters and have no way to make a living in the short term, are given rice tickets. The amount of rice is determined by the number of family members and the time required. Generally, adults receive one liter per day, and children receive five to eight he. (2) Assistance with funeral expenses: If a member's immediate family member dies, they can receive a maximum of 20 yuan in funeral expenses. If the member themselves dies, the insurance department will handle it separately. (3) Lending small capital: Those who are unable to pull a rickshaw due to old age, disability, or physical weakness after illness can be lent small capital to engage in small business. The amount is determined by the number of family members, with 5 yuan for the individual and 2 yuan for each additional person. Guidance is provided in advance, and inspections are conducted from time to time. This loan does not accrue interest and is not required to be repaid. (4) Providing travel expenses: Members who are ill and cannot be cured in the short term, or who are old and want to return to their hometown, are provided with travel expenses and accompanied to the port of departure. The individual receives 5 yuan, and each family member receives 2 yuan. (5) Other: If a fire occurs in a member's residence, the association will pay the first month's rent on their behalf. If there are disputes, mediation will be provided.</p>
<p>Relief Methods</p>
<p>Members can request the above-mentioned mutual aid benefits at any time based on the facts. An application form must first be filled out. If it is due to illness, a certificate from a clinic doctor must be attached, stating the symptoms and the number of days of treatment required. After the association sends someone to investigate and confirm the matter, it is submitted to the general manager for review, and then approved by the Mutual Aid Committee Chairman or one of the custodian committee members before it can be processed. Other requests for assistance with funeral expenses, small capital loans, and subsidies for rent are the same, except that a doctor's certificate is not required. The thoroughness of the procedure is to ensure the authenticity and value of the work and to prevent any malpractices. However, the processing time is as fast as possible, and ordinary cases must be completed within 48 hours at the latest and must not be delayed. When other work is deemed necessary, the Mutual Aid Committee can make recommendations to the Board of Directors for implementation, so as to provide members with relief and convenience as much as possible within the association's capacity.</p>
<p>Work Statistics</p>
<p>According to the department, since its establishment on January 1st of last year to the end of September of this year, it has handled a total of 8,302 mutual aid cases, with a total expenditure of 25,796.86 yuan. Among them, 7,156 cases involved rice distribution, totaling 13,645.31 yuan, accounting for an estimated 53%. There were 625 burial cases, totaling 9,496.24 yuan, accounting for 37%. There were 238 cases of travel expenses, totaling 1,242.05 yuan, accounting for 5%. There were 150 cases of small capital loans, totaling 1,172 yuan, accounting for 4%. There were 133 miscellaneous cases, totaling 41.26 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Health Protection Association Is Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Group members are joining the Shanghai Health Protection Association, sponsored by the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company. Since its establishment, it has gained the trust of all sectors of the city and is truly China's newest type of medical and socialized enterprise. Since the start of service two months ago, membership has reached about 20,000 people. In addition to individual membership, which is divided into basic members with an annual fee of three yuan and special members with an annual fee of ten yuan, there are other preferential measures for families and groups joining. This month, among the groups with a large number of members, there are the Commercial Press, Minsheng Industrial Company, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Da Lai Bank, Minfeng Company, Huafeng Company, Shanghai Ferry, Shanghai Bank, and other groups. The leaders of various major groups all believe that improving the health of personnel will improve work efficiency. It is also heard that in order to implement the basic work of protecting health, all members have the right to enjoy free physical examinations once they join the association. The examination includes (1) general conditions, such as height, weight, nutrition, muscles, fat, skin, mental attitude, blood pressure, etc. (2) head, such as eyes, ears, nose, land, etc. (3) neck, such as thyroid, etc. (4) chest, such as lungs, heart, etc. (5) abdomen, such as liver, spleen, stomach, kidneys, etc. In addition, the genitals, limbs, and reflexes are retained and carefully examined under the guidance of Dr. Li Zhongyong, the director of the association, and a report is issued to allow members to understand the health of their various parts. Its benefits to national health are by no means superficial. Since the start of this important work, members have been very interested in registering for examinations, and more than 5,000 people have registered, and more than 2,000 people have come to the association for examinations every day.</p>
<h3>The Tai Liu Road Has Been Opened to Traffic</h3>
<p>The long-distance bus service between Kunshan, Taicang, and Liuhe was suspended for repairs due to uneven road surfaces. It has been more than a month. Now it is learned that this project has been completed. Therefore, the service was opened to traffic the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Merchant Tramway Lines 1 and 4 Stopped Service Yesterday Afternoon Due to Soldiers Assaulting Drivers and Causing Uproar; Service Resumed at 6 PM After Party and Government Persuasion</h3>
<p>A report from the Da Gong She (Great Public Society) states that the Shanghai South Chinese Merchant Tramway Company's lines 1 and 4 stopped service yesterday afternoon at 3 PM due to an incident in which the line 4 driver had a minor altercation with soldiers stationed at the Gongchangmiao armory near the south station. The driver was assaulted and injured, causing public outrage among all drivers and ticket sellers, resulting in an uproar. Authorities dispatched personnel to persuade them, and service resumed around 6 PM. Detailed information is recorded below:</p>
<p>Incident Details</p>
<p>Chinese Merchant Tramway Company's tram number 36 on line 4 departed from Gongchangmiao at 2:54 PM yesterday, heading towards Nanyang Bridge. Upon arriving at the entrance of the south station, over forty soldiers stationed at the armory attempted to board the tram. Ticket seller Wang Xianglin, seeing the large number of people, asked them to board in batches, which led to a misunderstanding and conflict. The ticket seller immediately reported back to the company's traffic department. Subsequently, a soldier resembling an officer assaulted the driver, Yan Caifa, on the head, causing severe bleeding. Workers from the factory apprehended two soldiers involved in the incident and sent them to the south station police substation of the Public Security Bureau, who in turn transferred them to the West Gate branch requesting legal action.</p>
<p>Tram Service Suspension</p>
<p>Following the incident, all drivers and ticket sellers on the trams running from Xiaodongmen to Gongchangmiao and line 4 from Nanyang Bridge to Gongchangmiao expressed indignation and went on strike, causing the suspension of all services on line 1. The other lines, such as line 3 (circle line), line 2 (south circle line), and the outer circle line, continued to operate as usual. Around 6 PM, Lu Yin Chu from the Municipal Party Committee and Wang Gang from the Social Affairs Bureau were dispatched to persuade them to resume service and await a legal resolution. The workers expressed their acceptance, and service resumed at 6:20 PM. However, trams on lines 1 and 4 would still turn around at the Chinese Merchant Factory gate, waiting for the incident to be resolved before running to Gongchangmiao again.</p>
<p>Workers' Demands</p>
<p>During the incident yesterday, driver Yan Caifa was assaulted and injured, and sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Ticket seller Wang Xianglin also suffered minor injuries. The tram workers at the factory believed that they had been assaulted without cause, and were filled with indignation. They proposed the following demands: (1) Ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future; (2) The soldier responsible must guarantee the safety of the injured workers' lives and cover medical expenses; (3) The soldiers involved in the incident must be severely punished; (4) Lines 1 and 4 trams will not enter Gongchangmiao until the matter is resolved. Representatives from the Party and government accepted these conditions and promised to negotiate with the superior officer of the soldiers involved.</p>
<h3>Cutting Flesh to Heal Father, Foolishness in an Era of Moral Decay, Chen Youbo Can be Called a Filial Son</h3>
<p>Chen Youbo, a 23-year-old resident of Yangzhou living at 7 Fuxing Road, Yongxing Road, Chanbei, works as a paper mill worker. He is naturally filial. His elderly father is ailing and has been sick for years, but his illness worsened this winter, and all medications were ineffective. Youbo became distraught, abandoning food and sleep, attending to his father day and night. Helplessly, the father's condition worsened. Out of desperation, at around 10 PM last night, Youbo secretly cut a piece of flesh from his chest with a knife and made a broth for his father. However, it did not improve his father's condition, and the wound bled profusely, soaking through his clothes. His elder brother, Zongyi, noticed and questioned him, and he revealed the truth. He was rushed to Longhua Hospital. Fortunately, the wound was not large, and he was discharged after being bandaged. Although this act borders on foolish filial piety, in this era of declining morals, his foolishness is pitiable, and his intentions are commendable.</p>

The county government issued a prohibition notice two years ago. Now, in response to a letter from the China Animal Protection Society, stating that the practice of catching these creatures which has been indulged for so long is still ongoing, and requesting a renewed prohibition to protect animal life and curb the cruel practices, County Magistrate Li has approved the request. In addition to publicizing the prohibition, he has also instructed the Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate and ban such activities.</p>

<h3>Hai'ning Road Incident Involving Japanese Sailors; Police Appeal Concluded; Zhang Ronghe Firmly Denies Destroying Evidence; Court Scheduled to Announce Verdict on the Afternoon of the 30th of This Month</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the shooting of Japanese sailor Bihang Zhaoguang at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Hai'ning Road on the evening of September 23 of this year, after searching the vicinity of the scene, the police apprehended Zhang Ronghe, a Taizhou porridge vendor, who was seen hiding a handgun in a sand container at the entrance of Alley 15. He was prosecuted by the First Special District Court for the crime of destroying evidence under Article 165 of the Criminal Law. The court ruled that Zhang did not have criminal intent and declared him innocent. The Legal Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, dissatisfied with the verdict, filed an appeal to the Second Branch Court through lawyer Zhang Shuzhu. The appeal stated that Zhang arrived at the scene within minutes after hearing the gunshot and picked up the murder weapon, knowingly concealing an important piece of evidence. The original ruling was deemed inappropriate and should be overturned, and he should be punished accordingly. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu, along with assessors Zhou and Xiao, and Prosecutor Lin, heard the case in the criminal division of the Second Branch Court. After police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the reasons for the appeal, Zhang Ronghe testified that he intended to report the discovery of the handgun to the police but did not do so because he was afraid of being mistaken for the murderer. Therefore, he hid the gun in the sand container and planned to report it to the police later for a reward and had no intention of destroying evidence. Subsequently, Zhang's defense lawyer, Shan Yuhua, defended the appellee. Prosecutor Lin requested a ruling according to law. Judge Yu then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2 PM on the afternoon of the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Hospital Apprentice with Malicious Intent Poisons Tonics; Doctor's Wife and Daughter Suffer Collapsed Stomachs After Ingestion; Truth Revealed, Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Western doctor Zhan Keming founded Huadong Hospital at 56 Zhifu Road, where his family also resides. As winter approached, Zhan purchased "Bu Li Duo" tonics from Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company on Baike Road, which the family consumed daily. On the 22nd of this month, Zhan Keming left to attend a medical association meeting. Zhan's mother, Xu, and daughter, Rui Di (only three years old), consumed "Bu Li Duo" as usual, unexpectedly experiencing severe</p>
<p>abdominal collapse.</p>
<p>The condition was critical. Zhan Keming was urgently called home and rushed his mother and daughter to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The doctor determined that the medicine contained poison. Although the condition of Zhan Xu and Zhan Rui Di improved after treatment, Zhan Keming suspected that the "Bu Li Duo" produced by Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company, a well-known tonic manufacturer, would not contain poison. He launched a thorough investigation and sent the remaining "Bu Li Duo" to the Union Medical College Pathology Laboratory for testing. The results revealed</p>
<p>carbolic acid</p>
<p>(i.e., Lysol) mixed in. After a detailed investigation by Zhan Keming, he determined that someone had secretly tampered with the tonic. He reported the matter to the Laozha Public Security Bureau, and Detective Cao Qishan was assigned to investigate. The truth was uncovered only until the previous day. Zheng Fuliang, a 17-year-old from Ningbo, was introduced to Huadong Hospital as an apprentice a month ago. Zheng usually lived on the mezzanine. On the night of the 21st of this month, Zhan Xu</p>
<p>went out to see a play.</p>
<p>Zheng then snuck into the second floor and slept with another apprentice, Zhou Changgen, causing a disturbance. Zhan Keming learned of this and reprimanded Zheng Fuliang on the morning of the 22nd. Zheng harbored resentment and sought revenge. Knowing that the Zhan family consumed "Bu Li Duo" daily, he secretly mixed two grams of carbolic acid into the "Bu Li Duo" at 6 PM that day, causing Zhan and others to suffer abdominal pain as a</p>
<p>means of revenge. Since Zhan Kepeng was out attending a meeting and had not returned, only Zhan Xu and Zhan Rui Di consumed the tonic, leading to this incident. After the detectives investigated and confirmed the situation, they arrested Zheng Fuliang and detained him at the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he was sent to the criminal division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him for the crime of causing bodily harm under Article 77 of the Criminal Law, stating the</p>
<p>above situation,</p>
<p>and requested investigation. After further investigation, Zhan Kepeng complained about everything. Zheng Fuliang confessed that he mixed carbolic acid into the "Bu Li Duo" because he was scolded, intending to cause the teacher (i.e., Zhan Kepeng) and others to suffer abdominal pain. Judge Pan Zhenyang convicted Zheng Fuliang of causing bodily harm and sentenced him to one year and six months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire, Two Police Officers Shot</h3>
<p>At around 11 AM yesterday morning, two police officers from the 16th Sub-bureau of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were inspecting pedestrians along the outer Ma Road of Yanpu. When they approached Wharf 15 near the Great Wharf, two robbers approached them head-on. Before they got close, at a distance of four or five steps, the two robbers pulled out guns and opened fire, firing five or six shots in succession. Both police officers were hit and fell to the ground. The robbers fled swiftly. Upon hearing the alarm, the 16th Sub-bureau immediately dispatched detectives, but the robbers had already disappeared and were not captured. The injured police officers were rushed to Shanghai Hospital in an ambulance. One, Bin Keou, 22 years old, from Hunan, was shot twice. One bullet entered the lower abdomen and the other entered the right leg and exited the right hip. His injuries were extremely serious. The other, Jiang Bangju, 25 years old, from Anhui, was shot once. Fortunately, the bullet hit the copper button on his uniform, so it did not penetrate. However, the skin on his chest was bruised. His injuries were minor.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Statement: No Shipbuilding Orders with Japan</h3>

<h3>Changzhou Theater Melee Case, Caused by a Female Performer, Repeated Requests for Performances Rejected by the Actress, Perpetrators Receive Separate Sentences</h3>
<p>At around 4:30 PM on the 17th of this month, a melee broke out in the Changzhou theater located in the Deyilou teahouse at 796 Kade Road, Xinzha Road. After fighting in the theater, the fight continued on the street, with over five or six hundred people participating in the brawl. The road was blocked, and the participants used weapons such as iron bars, carrying poles, and wooden sticks. As a result, Wang Awu and Cheng Hongqi were injured. After receiving the report, the Xinzha Public Security Bureau immediately ordered Detective Tao Rubibi to lead a team of detectives to the scene. They apprehended five people who committed the violence, including Ye Gensheng, Gu Guomin, Cai Shaoqing, Huang Yaochu, and Ji Rongfu, and transferred them to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. It has been determined that the cause of the brawl was a feud between the hooligan Zhu Yusheng and Chen Xiaobing, who was with the Changzhou theater. Zhu often went to the theater to listen to the opera but did not buy tickets. The theater had a custom of allowing patrons to request performances on Sundays. Zhu repeatedly requested the female performer Zhou Juying to perform. One day, Zhu repeatedly requested performances from Zhou, but she refused to sing. Zhu harbored resentment, and the dispute arose. Zhu and Chen Xiaobing then fought on the 17th. The Public Security Bureau investigated Zhu and Chen and requested the First Special Court to issue warrants, summoning Zhu and Chen to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning to be interrogated along with Ye Gensheng and the other five. Zhu hired lawyer Fan Gang and Chen hired lawyer Wu Linkun to appear in court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution under Article 277 of the Criminal Law, requesting severe punishment according to law. After questioning by Judge Pan Zhenyang, Zhu Jinsheng was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, and Ye, Gu, Cai, Huang, and Ji were each sentenced to fifty days of detention. Chen Xiaobing was found not guilty. During the appeal period, Zhu was allowed to post bail of 500 yuan, and Huang was allowed to post bail of 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Debt Collector Powerful, Robber Flees, Robber's Clothes Also Torn</h3>
<p>Tan Li Yu, a debt collector from Deli Foreign Firm at 20 Jiujiang Road, lived at 94, Lane 617, Xiaoshadu Road, Shanghai West. Yesterday morning at around 8 AM, Tan was walking out of his house, intending to take a vehicle to work at the office when a young man wearing a black woolen coat stopped him at the entrance of the lane and threatened him with a gun, hoping to rob him. Unexpectedly, Tan was strong, brave, and resourceful. He bravely grabbed the robber around the waist and disarmed him. The robber knew he was no match and desperately struggled to escape. As a result, the pocket of the robber's coat was torn by Tan, and the robber's revolver and three bullets that had not been loaded also fell out of the pocket. Tan picked them up. The robber took advantage of this to flee and disappear. Afterwards, Tan took the three bullets to the Gordon Road Police Station and reported the incident, requesting an investigation.</p>

The corpse was about 17 or 18 years old, with short hair, wearing a blue cloth shirt, a white striped cloth vest, a black cloth jacket, black striped foreign cloth pants, flesh-colored silk stockings, and tan-colored carved leather shoes. The body was not swollen, unlike those who drowned, so the face was clear and not unpleasant. The corpse wore a pearl ring on its finger, a string of black prayer beads on its left wrist, and a green gemstone ring on the ring finger of its right hand. A pearl hairpin, a pearl jade bracelet, a pearl jade phoenix hairpin, a pair of pearl rings, a pair of jade rings, a jade ring, and nine large and small jade stones were found in her shirt and vest pockets. The pearls were very old, appearing deep yellow in color, and varied in quality. However, all the jade items were genuine. Most strangely, the lower abdomen was protruding, as if she was six or seven months pregnant, while the chest was flat, like a child. Her appearance was similar to that of a wealthy family's maid. It is unknown how she ended up dead in the river with valuable ornaments on her person. The police chief ordered that the recovered items, along with a one-yuan note from the Central Bank, a double dime coin, eleven pennies, and half a penny, be temporarily preserved pending investigation of the corpse's identity and further action.</p>

<h3>Former Foreman Xu Jinhai Sends Four Threatening Letters, Extortion of 1,000 Yuan Reduced to 800, Threatens to Chop off Head, Use Handgun, Letters Written at a Fortune-Telling Stall</h3>
<p>Huang Youbai, a 34-year-old from Ningbo, owns the Taichang Canned Goods and Biscuit Factory at 29 Dong'an Lane, Fangxie Road, South City. He lives a decent life. Xu Jinhai, a foreman who was previously employed at the factory, was laid off by the factory owner in July of this year. Three months have passed, and Huang had almost forgotten about him when he received four anonymous threatening letters on the 15th, 19th, 21st, and 23rd of this month. The initial extortion was for 1,000 yuan, later reduced to 800 yuan. The letters stated that the money should be delivered to the wall cavity next to the public toilet near the trash can on Xilin Road at 2 AM on the 24th of this month, with a red paper as a sign. Someone would come to collect it. Otherwise, they would chop off his head and use a handgun. After receiving the third letter, Huang reported the original letters to the 5th Detective Squad of the West Gate. After receiving the report, Squad Leader Dong Mingde, along with team leader Liu Guangjun, detectives Yu Ruhai, He Wenjin, Gu Junqing, and others, went undercover at around 12 AM the previous night to wait near the entrance of Deyi Lane, Xilin Road. At 2:30 AM yesterday morning, they saw a person pulling a rickshaw numbered 17036 to the location. He entered the public toilet and reached out to collect the money. He was apprehended. He confessed that his name was Xu Jinhai, 34 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at 14 Dachang Market, Renmin Road. He admitted to writing the threatening letters to extort money and claimed that he was the factory foreman who was laid off. He resorted to this scheme because he was impoverished. He also stated that the threatening letters were written at a nearby fortune-telling stall. The investigation of accomplices is ongoing. The suspect has been transferred to the branch bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>Yu Zhilu's Lawsuit: Embezzlement Case Dismissed</p>
<p>Yu Zhilu's previous case, in which he was accused by Chen Liu of embezzling public bonds, has been reported in this newspaper twice. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Chen Shuoying continued the hearing. Yu Zhilu argued that he had been representing the plaintiff's family in litigation and non-litigation matters for many years, handled by the plaintiff's brother, Liu Xueyi. Last year, when representing the plaintiff's husband, Chen Yuting, in petitioning the court to seize Xu Tingyu's bail money, he had to provide collateral. The defendant advanced 2,500 yuan in public bonds, which could be verified. At the end of last year, when settling accounts with Liu Xueyi, the advanced public bonds could not be retrieved, and both parties agreed to offset them with the bonds. When Chen Yuting retrieved them, they would be handed over to the plaintiff. In January of this year, Liu Xueyi passed away. There was a misunderstanding between the siblings. Chen Yuting and the plaintiff were also living separately. Recently, he returned to his ancestral home in Chaozhou, leading to the misunderstanding. The plaintiff stated in court that she had written to Chen Yuting, asking why he had not replied. Furthermore, the bonds in this case were handed over at the defendant's office in the Mainland Market and were not under the jurisdiction of this court. Whether Chen Yuting handed over the bonds to the plaintiff was a matter for which the defendant was willing to bear civil responsibility and did not constitute embezzlement. After questioning Chen Liu, Judge Chen acknowledged that Liu Xueyi had handled the matter, and the court declared the case dismissed.</p>
<p>American Chinese Bank Director Bao Ziwen Convicted: Violation of Savings Bank Law, Fined 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The American Chinese Bank, which had been in operation for less than a month, absorbed a large amount of deposits and suddenly went bankrupt. The creditors hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a criminal lawsuit against the bank's shareholders, directors, manager, deputy manager Gu Yubo, and others for embezzlement, with a civil suit attached to recover the deposits. Except for Gu Yubo, Zhang Xusheng, Li Yichou, and others who had fled and were wanted, Bao Ziwen and others had been summoned and questioned. However, Bao and others denied conspiracy and filed counterclaims against the plaintiffs for false accusations. Judge Huang concluded the investigation and ruled yesterday afternoon that the embezzlement charges could not be established. Bao Ziwen, as a director of the bank, should be held responsible for violating the Savings Bank Law and was fined 2,000 yuan. If he chose to perform labor instead of paying the fine, the conversion period would be determined by the ratio of 2,000 yuan to six months. The other defendants, Chen Yizai, Sun Wenkui, Liu Tongfu, Wang Zhonglin, Wu Chunlei, and Shen Jingzhong, were all found not guilty. The counterclaims against Wang Tingfang and others were also found not guilty. The attached civil suit was transferred to the civil court of this court for handling.</p>

<p>Ma Xiangbo and Others Plan to Build Song's Memorial Pavilion</p>
<p>The Puhuitang River in western Shanghai traverses the three areas of Shangsong and Qing, and with the Wusong River, it is one of the two major rivers. Due to years of disrepair, it has become increasingly silted up, hindering transportation. Later, with the efforts of local enthusiastic gentry Ma Xiangbo and others, a Dredging Promotion Association was organized, and they appealed for help. Song Ziwen allocated a large sum of money through the Post-War Relief Committee in the Songhu War Zone, and appointed managing directors Zhang Shouyong and Hu Yunzhuang to personally guide the dredging work. Since then, residents in western Shanghai have found convenience in drinking water, farmland irrigation, and commercial shipping. Therefore, there was a proposal to build a pavilion to commemorate the merits of the project. Now, under the recommendation of Elder Ma and others, Yang Fuyuan and Li Qixian have been appointed to be responsible for the preparation. The location has been selected at the Puhuitang Beach on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai. It is currently being designed by the Shanghai Jintai Engineer and contracted by Tao Guiji Construction Factory. It is expected to be completed soon at a cost of more than 2,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the esteemed editor,</p>
<p>The bandits and puppets are invading Suiyuan, and the national crisis is becoming more serious. The colleagues of our factory have a patriotic enthusiasm. Therefore, we collected 60 yuan in legal tender from one day's labor and sent it to your newspaper office at 5:00 PM on the 24th to be forwarded to the soldiers on the front lines. At that time, we obtained receipt number 2435. We thought that our factory name would be published in the newspaper today as usual, but upon inspection, there was no donation from the "Dalong" factory, only the name of the "Dalu" Dyeing and Weaving Factory. We suspect that the typesetter mistakenly typed "Long" as "Lu," or perhaps the Dalu Factory also made a donation. Please check this matter for us and make a correction. The donations from our factory are all piecemeal, and your newspaper's publication of them can be trusted by the public. I respectfully wish you good health.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Dalong Dyeing and Weaving Factory</p>

<p>Overview of Free Education Expenses in Various Provinces and Cities This Year</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the situation of free education expenses in various provinces and cities in 1936, based on the reports and interviews of the trainees from various provinces and cities in this year's Free Education Cadre Training Class of the Ministry of Education:</p>
<p>(Notes) (1) The sources of self-raised funds in various provinces and counties and cities are as follows: The Jiangsu Province education fee of 200,000 yuan comes from the provincial treasury of 100,000 yuan, and the counties and cities are organizing the management of school properties and self-donations. The Zhejiang provincial fee budget lists more than 170,000 yuan, which is borrowed and allocated from the education savings fund. Most of the county and city fees are collected from autonomous household donations ranging from 10% to 35%, as well as slaughter surcharges and late payment fines for land taxes. The Hunan province budget lists 260,000 yuan, and 50,000 yuan is allocated from the education fee item. The Hubei province fee is allocated 140,000 yuan from the previous year and an additional 60,000 yuan is allocated from the provincial treasury's general reserve fund item. The Shanghai municipal fee is allocated from the municipal treasury. The Qingdao municipal fee is allocated from the municipal treasury, of which 69,000 yuan is a temporary fee. Weihaiwei is allocated from the total administrative fee item of the office. The Jiangxi county and city fees come from various public properties, public funds, temple and ancestral hall properties, people's voluntary donations, and household contributions in the counties, districts, and villages. The Yunnan provincial treasury allocates 100,000 yuan, the group fee allocates 200,000 yuan, the autonomous surcharge is 70,000 yuan, and the provincial education fee item allocates 50,000 yuan. The Shandong provincial free education fund is 179,405 yuan, the military advance payment in 1929 is 132,358 yuan, and in 1930 it is 165,106 yuan. The provincial treasury allocates 30,000 yuan and the study abroad expenses are 10,000 yuan. The county and city fees are paid by the administrative commissioners of each county to the free education fund of 89,735 yuan, and the miscellaneous income from free education is 177,396 yuan, which has not yet been reported. As of the end of August, the Hebei county and city fees were more than 50,000 yuan. The Henan provincial treasury allocates 29,700 yuan, and the special education fund allocates 59,400 yuan. The county and city fees are raised by each county in accordance with the county order by the school districts according to the people's wealth. The Shaanxi provincial fee is allocated from the higher education fee item, and the county and city fees are allocated from the original school property construction fund, county tax revenue, land tax surcharge, provincial government subsidies, administrative group fees, and other items in the county's general budget. In Gansu, in addition to the central subsidy, the provincial treasury has not allocated funds, and each county raises funds, which are still the same as the previous year's method (the previous year's food item land tax surcharge, people's apportionment totaled 1,398,600 yuan). The Chahar county and city fees are disbursed from the administrative reserve fund item, and various surcharges such as deed tax, bucket donation, vehicle license donation, tooth tax, animal tax, and the Nankou road protection fee. The Tianjin and Beiping city fees are all allocated by the city treasury. (2) Editor's note: According to previous communications from various places, the central subsidy for Chahar in 1936 was 80,000 yuan, and Suiyuan was 130,000 yuan, which may be related to border education expenses. 68,000 yuan was used for free education in one province, and 60,000 yuan was used for free education in the other province. Also, according to investigations, Anhui received 210,000 yuan and Guangxi received 170,000 yuan. The free education and border education expenses subsidized by the central government in Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xikang in 1936 were 80,000, 70,000, and 60,000 yuan respectively. How much was actually used for free education and border education still needs to be investigated.</p>

<p>Popular Lectures: General Guan Tianpei by Su Zihan</p>
<p>During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, China banned the smoking of opium. The Governor-General of Liangguang, Lin Zexu, burned the opium brought by British ships, which naturally angered Britain. Britain then sent a large fleet of warships to attack Guangdong. However, Lin Zexu was capable of both defending and fighting. The British warships not only failed to win, but were also badly defeated.</p>
<p>The British troops were also cunning. They knew they couldn't conquer Guangdong, so they learned that Zhejiang and Zhili provinces were not well-prepared. They then sent their troops to attack these two provinces. The Chinese troops in these two provinces were defeated, and the territories were lost. The Emperor and his ministers were extremely frightened and quickly sent envoys to negotiate peace. As a result, Lin Zexu was exiled, and Qi Shan, the Governor-General of Zhili, was sent to Guangdong. Qi Shan was incompetent and far inferior to Lin Zexu. He was tricked by the British troops, and Guangzhou was eventually lost.</p>
<p>Fine, envoys were sent again to negotiate peace. The British, seeing that the Chinese ministers were useless, made things difficult in every way before a peace treaty could be agreed upon. Hong Kong was ceded to Britain at this time.</p>
<p>This is the infamous "Opium War" in recent Chinese history, a national humiliation.</p>
<p>Don't think that Qi Shan was useless, because besides Lin Zexu, a loyal minister, Guangdong also had a hero.</p>
<p>Initially, Li Zengjie, the Guangdong Naval Commander, was demoted by the court for being too negligent in his defense, allowing British ships carrying opium to sail unhindered into Lao Pu. Subsequently, Guan Tianpei, the General of the Su-Song Garrison, was transferred to be the Guangdong Naval Commander. Guan Tianpei was from Shanyang County, Jiangsu Province, and came from a military background, but he was also a good general.</p>
<p>After Guan Tianpei took office, he personally went out to inspect the terrain everywhere. He built forts and arranged defensive lines in important locations, making them extremely strong. In his spare time, he would either drill his troops or practice archery, horsemanship, and martial arts.</p>
<p>After the ban on opium was initiated, British warships came to attack Guangdong. Lin Zexu and Guan Tianpei worked together to fight the British troops, and as a result, the British troops retreated.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Guan Tianpei further fortified his garrison area, Humen, and strengthened the defense of the ten forts outside Humen. The Dajiao and Shajiao forts, which were farthest from Humen, were also the most important.</p>
<p>Who knew that the court was focused on making peace, and replaced Lin Zexu, and to make matters worse, the one who took over was the useless Qi Shan.</p>
<p>In December of the 20th year of Daoguang (1840), taking advantage of Lin Zexu's departure from Guangdong, British warships launched a major attack on Guangdong, first attacking the Dajiao and Shajiao forts.</p>
<p>Qi Shan only wanted to negotiate peace with the British troops, or at least delay their attack on Guangzhou. Every day, he sent envoys to deliver official documents for negotiation. The British were cunning enough. They had truly seen through Qi Shan. They also sent people to return some official documents, as if negotiations were possible, but at the same time, they continued to send troops to attack the forts outside Humen, launching attacks day and night.</p>
<p>At that time, there were probably tens of thousands of Banner troops and Governor-General's personal troops stationed in Guangzhou. Adding the reinforcements from other provinces and local militia, there were several tens of thousands of soldiers in total. However, Qi Shan only sent 200 personal troops to help defend the ten forts, stationed in Dongguan, and another 200 garrison troops, ready to respond. It seemed that defending the forts was a matter for the navy and had nothing to do with the army. I ask, what could this small number of people do? As a result, the Dajiao and Shajiao forts could not withstand the British warships' cannons and were eventually lost!</p>
<p>This situation of negotiating peace one moment and fighting the next continued until January of the 21st year of Daoguang (1841). Only the Weiyuan and Jingyuan forts remained of the ten forts, and the defending troops were only a few hundred exhausted soldiers.</p>
<p>Reinforcements from Guangzhou did not arrive. What could these remaining few hundred soldiers accomplish? Guan Tianpei had no choice but to send Commander Mai Tingzhang to Guangzhou to request reinforcements.</p>
<p>Mai Tingzhang obeyed the order and went to Guangzhou to meet Qi Shan, who did receive him. After Mai Tingzhang reported the situation of fighting the British troops for the past month, he also reported: "Only two of the ten forts outside Humen remain, and the soldiers are few and exhausted. If reinforcements are not sent, it is obvious that these two forts will not be able to hold out. Humen is a crucial location for Guangzhou. Without Humen, there is no Guangzhou. If Your Excellency sends troops to defend Humen, it would be the same as saving Guangzhou, and also saving China."</p>
<p>Who knew that Qi Shan was obsessed with peace talks? No matter how Mai Tingzhang pleaded, he simply refused to send troops. Mai Tingzhang had no choice but to return.</p>
<p>When Guan Tianpei heard from Mai Tingzhang that Qi Shan would not send troops, he was enraged, and cursed Qi Shan for harming the country. After a while, when his anger subsided, he sighed to himself: "A true man should repay the country with his life. Now that the situation is urgent, I must defend the fort to the death. As long as the fort stands, I will stand. If the fort falls, I will die. I can't even think of my eighty-year-old mother at home, and my wife and young children!" He also said to Mai Tingzhang: "Now that we are outnumbered, death is all that awaits us. General, you must make your own plans."</p>
<p>Mai Tingzhang calmly said: "If Your Excellency can repay the country with your life, how can your subordinate not do the same? If we are to die, let us die together, let us die defending this piece of our country's territory!"</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Guan Tianpei grabbed Mai Tingzhang's hand and said! "General Mai, you are truly Guan Tianpei's good brother, a true comrade!"</p>
<p>So Guan Tianpei and Mai Tingzhang gathered the defeated and remaining troops and defended the Jingyuan Fort to the death.</p>
<p>On February 6th of the 21st year of Daoguang (1841), British warships launched a major attack on Jingyuan Fort. Cannonballs and bullets rained down on the fort. Guan Tianpei, leading Mai Tingzhang, directed the soldiers to fight back amidst the gunfire. From dawn to afternoon, most of these few hundred soldiers had died. Guan Tianpei himself had also suffered many injuries, and his clothes were covered in blood. Knowing that the fort could not be defended, he told his servant, Sun Changqing, to leave, saying: "I have failed my responsibility to defend the territory and deserve to die. You are just a servant, why should you die with me? Leave! Take the seal to the Governor-General."</p>
<p>Sun Changqing refused to leave, and holding onto Guan Tianpei's clothes, he cried: "This servant has followed his master for decades and has received many kindnesses from his master that he can never repay. Today, when my master is in trouble, can this servant betray his conscience and escape for his own life? Let us die together!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Guan Tianpei was furious. He drew his sword and said: "I have failed the country, failed my parents, and deserve to die! Why don't you leave? If you don't leave, I will kill you first!" Saying this, he threw the seal to Sun Changqing, "This seal is very important. If you deliver the seal to the Governor-General's office, it will be considered that you have repaid me!"</p>
<p>Sun Changqing had no choice but to take the seal. Crying, he ran down the mountain. By the time he reached halfway up the mountain, Guan Tianpei had already fallen on the fort.</p>
<p>Sun Changqing finally managed to deliver the seal to the Governor-General's office. Ignoring the wounds all over his body, he immediately ran back to Jingyuan Fort. When he arrived, the fort had already been occupied by British troops, and he could not enter.</p>
<p>Sun Changqing hid around the fort, looking for an opportunity to enter. Coincidentally, a translator named Wu was wandering around there. Translator Wu had also received kindnesses from Guan Tianpei. Sun Changqing tearfully recounted his desire to enter the fort to find Guan Tianpei's body. Translator Wu, after all, was Chinese and was moved by what he heard. He also wanted to take this opportunity to repay Guan Tianpei. He spoke to the British general guarding the fort on behalf of Sun Changqing. The British general also valued Sun Changqing's loyalty and allowed him to enter the fort to search.</p>
<p>Two British soldiers escorted Sun Changqing, searching everywhere in the fort for Guan Tianpei's body. They could not find it. Later, they walked to the place where Guan Tianpei had been standing to supervise the battle and overturned twenty or thirty bodies before finally finding him. Half of his body had been burned by the cannons.</p>
<p>As soon as Sun Changqing saw the body, he fainted. The two British soldiers tried to revive him. They searched again. After searching for a while, they also found Mai Tingzhang's body. It was even more tragic, with only half a body remaining!</p>
<p>After the bodies were found, Sun Changqing went to raise money to buy coffins and had them encoffined. Then, after untold hardships, he finally sent them back to their hometown for burial.</p>
<p>Truly! Guan and Mai were loyal ministers, and Changqing was a righteous man! Their names are recorded in history, and their righteousness fills the land!</p>

<h3>Madame Roland, the Foremost Woman of Recent Times by Lin Ye</h3>
<p>(Continued from Issue 34)</p>
<p>In June of that year, Louis XVI, who had been placed under house arrest, quietly escaped, was captured, and returned to Paris. Madame Roland, considering the situation in the country at that time, was very saddened, believing that there was only a revolution in name, but no actual revolution had taken place. She often sighed to herself and said, "I hope there will be another revolution in the country! But do the people still have this power?" After some time, she reluctantly returned to Lyon. On the way, she distributed many of Robespierre's revolutionary manifestos, hoping to use them to arouse the revolutionary fervor of the masses.</p>
<p>Soon, the National Assembly was dissolved, and another Legislative Assembly was established to control national politics. The Legislative Assembly was composed of seven hundred and forty-five new deputies, and Mr. Roland was one of them.</p>
<p>In the Legislative Assembly, the most influential group was the Girondins. They were composed of many young, energetic, virtuous, patriotic, and idealistic youths. The leader of the Girondins was Mr. Roland, but in fact, it was Madame Roland who trained and directed these people.</p>
<p>At this time, the national situation became increasingly urgent, with internal and external troubles coming one after another. Louis XVI, barely clinging to life, had no choice but to condemn the old ministers who had harmed the country and rely on the popular party. Mr. Roland, as the hope of the people, was appointed Minister of the Interior. This new Minister of the Interior, when entering the inner court, often wore ordinary clothes, old shoes, and a round hat, which greatly surprised the courtiers.</p>
<p>After Mr. Roland became Minister of the Interior, Madame Roland's influence grew even greater. During the day, she gathered various parties at her private residence, and at night, she devoted herself to helping Mr. Roland plan various matters. Whenever Mr. Roland discussed matters with his colleagues, he would invite Madame Roland to attend. The important documents piled up on the Minister of the Interior's desk all had to pass through Madame Roland's hands first before being handed over to the secretary. All reports submitted to the National Assembly and the Cabinet were drafted by Madame Roland. What drove the new government towards the ideal of a republic was not Roland, but Madame Roland. Roland wore the golden seal of the six ministers of the interior, but the real power was in the hands of this beautiful female premier.</p>
<p>Madame Roland felt that the great task of reforming the country's internal affairs could not be entrusted to the court. She often said, "Others trust Louis, but I don't trust him. I believe that a person who was born in an autocratic era and established as king by autocratic power can never practice constitutional politics."</p>
<p>Madame Roland urged her husband, the other ministers, and the entire Girondin party to distance themselves from Louis. In June of that year, the conflict between the new government and King Louis reached its peak. On August 10th, Louis XVI was imprisoned in another palace, and the monarchy was completely overthrown.</p>
<p>After the monarchy was overthrown, power was completely in the hands of the people. These people were a group driven mad by the intoxicating drug of revolution, tyrannical, rampaging, and completely trampling on the true republican justice. At this time, the only one who could suppress this group of mobs was Danton, the leader of the Mountain party in the former Legislative Assembly. Danton now wanted to lead his party to form an alliance with the Girondin party led by the Roland couple in order to expand his influence, but Madame Roland firmly opposed it, believing that if this alliance was not rejected, the influence of the Girondin party could not be maintained. Danton initially longed for the establishment of this alliance and went to Madame Roland's reception room every day to discuss the matter. Later, seeing Madame Roland's firm attitude, he realized that this matter could not succeed, and his admiration for Madame Roland turned into resentment. He was never seen in the Roland's home again.</p>
<p>Before long, Danton's Mountain party stained Paris with blood. They completely massacred the royalists imprisoned in the prisons of Paris. At this point, Madame Roland deeply realized their ferocious and brutal faces. In a letter to a friend, she said, "We are already under the knives of Robespierre and Marat. My friend Danton is truly an enemy of the revolution. He uses Robespierre as a puppet and Marat as his wings, holding a dagger and a fuse to stab and bomb the people. You know how passionate I am about the revolution. But now I feel that the revolution is a shameful thing. The revolution has been sullied by unscrupulous villains! Decades of hard work have resulted in the country falling to this state, and I truly feel sad. This is also a disgrace to the revolutionary party."</p>
<p>Although the situation was deteriorating day by day, Madame Roland's ambition did not diminish slightly, and she often encouraged the heroes under her command, saying, "Even though we have no ability to save ourselves today, as long as we are still alive at this moment, we must think of ways to save our country." At that time, only Roland and Brissot of the Girondins held power, and their strength was weak. The opinions they put forward were often not accepted.</p>
<p>On January 21, 1793, the Mountain party sent the deposed King Louis XVI to the guillotine. Soon they wanted to completely eliminate the influence of the moderate republican Girondin party. On one night in May of that year, they sent police officers to arrest the Roland couple. Mr. Roland heard the news in advance and escaped. Madame Roland was arrested. She was not afraid when she was arrested and comforted her weeping beloved daughter with gentle words. They imprisoned her in the Abbaye prison.</p>
<p>Madame Roland spent her days in prison accompanied by books and flowers, without terror or despair. She also gave all the money in her pockets to the poor prisoners, and she did not consider coarse cloth and bad food to be a hardship.</p>
<p>After being imprisoned for twenty-four days, she suddenly received an order for her release. She shook hands with the prisoners in the same prison and bid farewell, and drove home. Who knew that after arriving home, before she could talk to her family, several police officers followed her tracks and came, took out the arrest warrant from their arms, and arrested Madame Roland again. This time, she was transferred to another prison.</p>
<p>In prison, Madame Roland's heroic spirit did not diminish in the slightest, and she still wrote letters to encourage her comrades. She said in a letter to her friend, "My friend, I hope you will not be discouraged and continue to work hard. People like Brutus, when exiled in the fields of Philippi, sighed and said, 'I can no longer save Rome!' I do not admire this." In addition to reading books for self-entertainment, she also used music to express her emotions. She borrowed a stringed instrument from the jailer's wife and played it from time to time, sighing as she played, and all who heard it were moved.</p>
<p>On October 20th, Madame Roland was transferred from the Sainte-Pélagie prison to the Conciergerie prison. Here she was interrogated several times. On the day before the final public trial, a lawyer came to see Madame Roland and claimed that he was willing to defend her. Madame Roland said to him, "My fate is already determined, you don't need to defend me, lest you endanger your own life." After speaking, she took off the ring on her hand and gave it to the lawyer to express her gratitude.</p>
<p>On the day of the public trial, Madame Roland appeared in court wearing a snow-white dress. Her wavy curled hair and clear blue eyes complemented the white dress; she was holy, noble, and looked like a heavenly being. The judge presented various false evidences to slander her. She spoke eloquently in court, calmly defended herself, and showed no fear. She said, "The actions of the Girondin party are blameless before heaven and earth. True great men give up their private feelings and desires and dedicate themselves to their country and compatriots without regret. I am waiting here today for you to announce my death sentence. When a righteous man goes to the guillotine, it is also when he enters the triumphal arch. What am I still clinging to in this world of filth and chaos that uses human blood as wine!" I silently wish that the people of my country will be able to enjoy true freedom soon."</p>
<p>These sincere and earnest words left the bloodthirsty judge at a loss for words. In the end, he arbitrarily fabricated the charges of being involved in conspiracies and being detrimental to the republican system, and announced Madame Roland's death sentence.</p>
<p>That afternoon, after Madame Roland returned to prison, she gathered her thoughts and wrote several letters to her relatives and friends. In the last sentence of her letter to her beloved daughter, she said, "You should take your parents as an example to cultivate yourself, so that you can be considered not to have lived in vain in this world."</p>
<p>The next day—November 9, 1793, Madame Roland was carried in a prison carriage to the execution ground.</p>
<p>There is a common practice in the West: when men and women are executed at the same time, the woman goes first, and the man goes after, because they are afraid that the woman will be terrified and tremble when she sees the tragic state of the executed. The man who came in the same car with Madame Roland that day was already pale and trembling before the execution. Madame Roland, seeing his appearance, felt very sorry for him, and said, "Please die first! Lest you be more frightened by seeing the tragedy of my bloodshed." After speaking, she asked the executioner to change the order of execution. Madame Roland's heart of loving others and being chivalrous never changed.</p>
<p>Madame Roland ascended the guillotine and suddenly saw a huge statue on the platform, titled "Goddess of Liberty". Madame Roland bowed to it and sighed with emotion, "Liberty! Liberty! How many sins are committed in your name!" With a flash of the electric blade, Madame Roland's forty-one years of magnificent and righteous life were ended! From then on, Madame Roland left the mortal world and became a historical figure.</p>
<p>After Madame Roland died for her country, one of her maids and one of her servants threw themselves into the court, asking to die with Madame Roland. This was entirely due to Madame Roland's kindness and love, which could move people to this point.</p>

<h3>Reading "Random Notes on Life" by Shen Zuguan</h3>
<p>Written by Chen Shi, published by Commercial Press</p>
<p>The book "Random Notes on Life" by Chen Shi was recently published by the Commercial Press. This book contains thirty-four articles. It can be said that Mr. Chen wrote this book as a realist writer; because the articles such as "Seven Li Rapids", "On the Lanxi River", "Anchoring to Avoid Wind in Xiangshan Harbor", etc. describe the scenery; "Hospital Notes", "Plum Rain Season", "Autumn Nights in Childhood", "The Death of Mother", etc. describe the state of mind, all of them are documentary works. The articles "My Cousin's Wedding", "Ashes", "Village Chief", "Locusts", "Gunfire at Midnight", "New Year's Eve and New Year", etc. describe the social situation and the sufferings of the people to the core.</p>
<p>I often say that modern prose articles must have three conditions: "(1) They must have the nature of the times and not go backwards. (2) They must be rich in emotion and not be boring. (3) They must be able to describe the social aspects of the inner society to expose the world." And Mr. Chen's "Random Notes on Life" can be said to have no shortcomings in these three conditions. It is a reading material needed by ordinary young people in modern times, but I also have an idea, what is the idea? That is, according to China's current position in the international arena and all the phenomena of domestic society, China's changes can be said to be unprecedented in ancient times: because the country is weak, it is practically necessary to seek strength; because the official governance is corrupt, it is practically necessary to clarify it politically. Especially at present, the collective is decadent, and there must be writings that greatly criticize the current situation: such writings must have the emotion of feeling, lamenting, and applauding; they are relatively prescribing medicines for modern diseases. It must be known that there are too many literary works about tempting words of love at this time; if there are too many literary works that tempt words of love, the reaction is to form a habit of decline and weakness, and this kind of habit is extremely dangerous to the future of the nation. A certain era has a certain era's aspirations, and then there is a certain era's style. "Song of Everlasting Regret" is only suitable for the style of the Tang Dynasty, and "Water Margin" is only suitable for the style of the Yuan Dynasty. Because the background and position are different, the generated thoughts naturally differ. "Random Notes on Life" is a modern crop. Although there is no atmosphere of tragic songs, laments, and applause, there is no shortcoming of tempting to talk about love. It has a natural style. It is a true realist work. This is worth reading for ordinary young people, so I specially wrote an article "Reading Random Notes on Life" to inform the readers.</p>
<h3>Advocating the Understanding of Mental Hygiene (Continued) by Deng Jialiang</h3>
<p>The greatest feature of this book is that the author finds many examples of abnormal psychology in daily life, and attributes them to the mistakes in parental education in childhood, emphasizing the influence of parents on children's mental hygiene and the necessity of parental education. Therefore, this book uses a casual way to analyze in detail, which is a book that parents and general teachers must refer to.</p>
<p>In the chapter on the style of personality, the author especially pays attention to egomania, which is aimed at China's current big disease. The most problematic thing about the Chinese national character now is the development of selfishness. On many malpractices, it is also due to the self-individualism that is playing a ghost there. The author once said this about selfishness: "If someone is to fall down, it is someone else's turn, not mine. If the selfish person becomes poor, or the family is extremely poor, then the path of stealing, impersonating, and defrauding is very convenient for him. Because that seems to lead him to his destination most easily." This is very true. Many crimes and the loss of public interests of society are being carried out openly or secretly. We should not think that the prisoners in the prison are harming the interests of society. There are still many people who have not been exposed and are actually criminal behaviors, but are only being punished psychologically, that is, the extreme flooding of egomania, which has become the greatest enemy of mental hygiene.</p>
<p>Although it is impossible for educators to completely eliminate the ego, making the children's egomania gradually become objective is not only related to the children's lifelong happiness, but also the key to rescuing human beings from the evil and selfish environment. It is an iron principle that parents must not guide children with their own views, but in fact many parents cannot use objectivity to guide children.</p>
<p>There are many examples like this in the book, and I will not list them here.</p>
<p>However, this book has made great efforts in analyzing abnormal psychology, as the author put forward the principle of the clear mirror: "A person should not only judge other people's behavior, but must judge the behavior that is related to that person and his own behavior. His own behavior should not only be studied from the surface, but should use the incomprehensible personality science to discover the degree of his own egomania." This can be said to be very correct. His investigation of children's cases also gives psychologists and educators important tasks and extremely valuable references: "We should conduct a thorough and detailed investigation with children and their parents. All memories, past events, dreams, games, achievements, and failures must be studied. A psychologist is a historian, he must pay attention to the intentional selection and change of materials, and also pay attention to the materials and, narration methods and front and rear arrangements. But his greatest assistance is not history, nor is it science, but it is beyond the scholar, stated in the confusion: that is, a social experiment." There are novel insights.</p>
<p>But in this book, there are still many shortcomings that we need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>First, the author has not completely liberated himself from the psychological consciousness, or the scope of the heart, with a very strong mysterious atmosphere, looking at it, it seems not to be a book about psychology, but to lead the reader into the atmosphere of philosophy. Of course, we first realize that this is a book of psychoanalysis as the author himself said: "The incomprehensible personality science fails to express itself from the front, and undoubtedly cannot satisfy those who are devoted to science. The basic effective principles of all personality qualities and all personality changes, that is, so-called 'life', are not fully stated.</p>
<p>Second, because it overemphasizes analysis, the mental hygiene instructions for construction are less than the creeds of abnormal psychology, so it cannot tell us much about mental hygiene knowledge.</p>
<p>Third, the scope of analysis is too broad, for example, occupations are used to change love, and daily personality is also discussed, but it can only give us superficial facts, and cannot enable readers to further understand the various habits that mental hygiene should build.</p>
<p>Finally, the difficulty of the translation makes readers feel dull; if they are not interested in mental hygiene, it is difficult to read to the end; I hope it can be revised in the reprint to make it popular and smooth, so that every parent with children can read this book without much effort to not lose the meaning of family books (End)</p>
<h3>How to Study Philosophy (II) by Yi Lin</h3>
<p>Written by Wang Tefu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore</p>
<p>Three, Methods of Studying Philosophy:</p>
<p>To study philosophy, it is necessary to understand reality, and reality should be used as a mirror for studying philosophy. Philosophical theories should be applied to verify reality. That is to say, studying philosophy requires observing nature and society, and that is to say, philosophical research requires empirical and experimental methods. In philosophical research, the most important experimental method is practice. Because only full practice can understand nature and society, can obtain a correct worldview, and develop new knowledge. If human beings do not only stagnate at the inherent stage of the knowledge that has been acquired, and want to enable us to obtain new theories and knowledge, and enable us to have a new development of knowledge on a new basis, this is only possible by studying in practice. Practice is the standard for criticizing worry-free theories, is the only opportunity to promote knowledge, and is a high-level research method for developing the vitality of knowledge growth. As for the methodology of science, although it attaches importance to thinking at the same time, it also attaches importance to the experimental method of experimentation. From experience to thinking and then to experience, experience is the main thing, and thinking is only the process of reorganizing and tempering experience. This is the research method of materialism.</p>
<p>Four, Philosophical Analysis Research:</p>
<p>When we study philosophy, whether for the objective things discussed by philosophy or for the philosophical theory itself, it is necessary to analyze and study them. For example, when we want to study social philosophy, we must be able to analyze the essence of society, creation and change, etc., and then we can understand the theory listed by social philosophy itself. The analysis research method mentioned here only refers to the content or theory of philosophy, and analyzes it according to its theoretical nature, and assigns it to which of the philosophical problems or belongs to which school of theory.</p>

<h3>Couple Knowledge in the "Times Medicine Journal" by Dr. Zhang Junshi, German Medical Doctor</h3>
<p>What is the highest peak of love?...Sexual life is the core of married life, that is, the highest peak of love...To maintain the peak of love, it is necessary to cultivate sufficient sexual function first.</p>
<p>In a story or a script, the most emotionally tense place is the climax (that is, the highest peak). If there is no such fascinating place, it will look slack and bland, tasteless. The progress of love is also like this, it will gradually reach the highest peak. If the man and woman are not satisfied with each other at this highest peak, love will definitely cool down and even decrease.</p>
<p>So what is the highest peak of love? Many people must say marriage. This answer is not wrong, but marriage is just a ceremony. We should be straightforward and quick, and recognize sexual life as the highest peak of love, because this is the core of married life.</p>
<p>At this highest peak of love, how can both men and women succeed? The only way is to cultivate sufficient and sound sexual function. Undeniably, in the middle of sexual life, men and women are pursuing to satisfy their innate desires, and the satisfaction of this desire must be based on the resonance of the other party.</p>
<p>Young men and women with weak sexual function can do their best, but cannot coordinate with the other party's exuberant enthusiasm. Many men suffer from impotence, in vain with enthusiasm like fire, and finally are abandoned outside the gate of sexual life; many men have small local parts, or suffer from premature ejaculation, of course they will be hated or despised by women; in addition, there are those who are infected with gonorrhea, and even fewer women are willing to approach him. There are also similar unfortunate people among women, with weak libido, or even birds, completely unable to have a happy sexual life, and the husband will naturally not be satisfied.</p>
<p>Suffering from such diseases, at the highest peak of love, they will definitely not be able to stand firm. These are all evil results caused by masturbation, lust, etc., which hinder the development of the gonads and damage the ejaculation function. Therefore, most of the male patients suffer from spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>How to help them? The most appropriate way is to invest in the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su", which is made by refining the essence of healthy animal gonads, and is divided into male and female types. The male one can activate impotence and premature ejaculation, incomplete development, small local parts, and can transform a weak and useless weak man into a sound and great husband. However, those who suffer from spermatorrhea must also take "Himi Toshi's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and restore the control over ejaculation.</p>
<p>"Female Sheng Zhi Su" can cure female frigidity or cold feeling, and can adjust menstruation and promote development in order to seek a healthy and beautiful posture. As for gonorrhea, if it is an obstacle to sexual life, it is advisable to take the combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine "An Di Lin" urgently. If a woman has been infected by her husband, both must take it together, so as not to have the crisis of resurgence.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: "Sheng Zhi Su" and "Himi Toshi's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" are generally packed in iron boxes. Those with paper boxes and bottles on the market are all counterfeit medicines. You must recognize the iron box when purchasing.)</p>
<h3>Guidance for Treatment: The Latest Method to Eliminate Gonorrhea by Dr. Yao Chongpei, University of Pennsylvania Medical Doctor</h3>
<p>It was not long ago that gonorrhea would be regarded as an unspeakable disease. According to my observation, the difficulty of treating gonorrhea, or even incurable, is indeed due to the complexity of the condition and its ease of spread; half of it is also due to the patient's delay and random investment in miscellaneous medicines.</p>
<p>The injections and washing strips used by doctors are cumbersome, and the patient has already regarded them as a daunting task. Even a part of the application is careful, which will lead to abuses and make all the previous achievements wasted. The difficulty of this treatment has indeed added many difficulties to the work of eradicating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Therefore, taking an oral medicine that is easy to use and effective has become what the world hopes for. Many diuretic and analgesic drugs based on white sakura oil are only willing to have a temporary effect, and they have appeared one after another, which has made people have a kind of contempt for oral medicines.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Jeter Sheng of Germany firmly believes that oral medicines will be successful one day. The scope of research has given him the invention of the combination preparation of yellow pigment and vaccine, named "An Di Lin". This preparation has a great ability to kill bacteria and resist toxins, and has become the latest and most convenient method to eliminate gonorrhea.</p>
<p>When Dr. Jeter first claimed to have invented this medicine, he was ridiculed by most doctors. They all thought that treating gonorrhea was not something that oral medicines could do, and thought that Jeter was dreaming. The inventor did not engage in verbal disputes with them, but only worked hard to apply this medicine to treat diseases for people. In less than a year, he had cured five or six thousand people, and they never relapsed after healing. This achievement shocked the entire Germany and Europe, attracting many reports that proved the medicine's reliability, and established the position of the new treatment.</p>
<h3>Sexual Enlightenment by Dr. Zhan Nianzeng</h3>
<p>What are the consequences of excessive masturbation? How can nocturnal emission be cured completely? Which is more harmful, female masturbation or male masturbation, and how can it be remedied?</p>
<p>So-called masturbation, is a form of sexual desire emission that does not follow the purpose of reproduction; that is, through various methods, to stimulate the local area and indulge in a kind of pleasant feeling behavior, both men and women are guilty of it. The largest proportion is about the period from 14 to 24 years old. Regarding the causes of masturbation and its various harms, there is a detailed description in this journal. The purpose of this article is to contribute one or two more methods of correcting it, which I think will also be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>To correct masturbation, the main problem is to be pure of heart and have few desires, and to cultivate sufficient energy, so the will is strong, and the viewpoint of harm is also clear. However, it is difficult to achieve twice the result with half the effort by just relying on empty words. The reason is that people with weak bodies cannot engage in labor and become lazy, easily falling into a state of fantasy. Misunderstanding the special interest of sensuality, thus revealing the motivation of buying it. Therefore, in addition to cleaning up the environment and removing all bad contacts, the main thing is to use medicine to save it. Observing with sharp medical eyes, only the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" can enhance energy. Although it is said to be the main good medicine to eliminate all diseases caused by masturbation, such as neurasthenia, premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete local development, it can indirectly make the purpose of masturbation automatically weaken. A patient, in the past period, was addicted to masturbation, and all the harms such as tinnitus, headache, insomnia, forgetfulness, etc. occurred. Although he abstained from masturbation, because of his weak body, he could not produce a strong control, and as a result, the bad habit became more and more deeply rooted, and at the same time, the diseases he contracted tended to become more serious. So he started to use "Sheng Zhi Su" to eliminate its harm. Unexpectedly, after taking it for a week, he felt full of energy, slept comfortably, and the occasional fantasy disappeared. As a result, not only was the severe neurasthenia cured, but the abstention from masturbation was not as difficult as before, and he abstained from the bad habit without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Regarding the harm of masturbation, in addition to the above</p>

<h3>Dredging of Silt at Shentan - 5.5 Million Tons - Dredging Progressing Exceptionally Smoothly - Third Dredger to be Built</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Dredging Bureau commenced the dredging project of the silt at Shentan, outside the Wusongkou harbor, progress has been extremely smooth. To date, 5.5 million tons of silt have been dredged. However, to avoid collisions within the appropriate navigation channel in the dredged area, work is still limited to daytime hours and night shifts have not been added. At the same time, the second large dredger, for which the Bureau solicited bids from shipbuilders of various countries, has not yet been awarded to a specific shipbuilder. A decision is expected by the end of the year. Furthermore, the Bureau has several older dredgers, and due to their somewhat aged condition, they are inviting bids from all sectors for their purchase.</p>

<h3>Zhu Yundi Divorce Case - Handwriting Verification Pending - One Word Signed on Divorce Agreement - Authenticity Requires Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhuang Tinggui, a native of Wuxi, is the younger brother of Zhuang Tingbiao, the owner of the Xin Hengtai Iron Factory on Singapore Road. Due to disagreements with his wife, Zhu Yundi, the two parties agreed to a divorce in July. Zhuang paid Zhu over three thousand yuan in alimony. On September 7th, Zhuang married Luo Lili, a local woman, at the Yipinxin Hotel. Now, Zhu has suddenly denied the divorce agreement and filed a complaint with the Lao Zha Police Station, accusing Zhuang and Luo of bigamy. The police station filed a public prosecution with the Special First Court. After several summonses, as Zhu had previously attempted suicide, the court, in order to clarify the truth about Zhu's suicide, ordered the investigation report from the Gordon Road Police Station to be retrieved and the officer in charge, Bao Detective, to be summoned to court. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Zhuang Tinggui and Luo Lili hired Chen Tingrui as their lawyer. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that Tao Afu, the Chinese detective who investigated Zhu Yundi's suicide attempt, was present and requested to be questioned. Detective Tao testified that after receiving the report of Zhu Yundi's suicide attempt, he went to Guangren Hospital to investigate. Zhu stated that she attempted suicide due to having to move out after divorcing her husband. He reported this to the Western Detective and ordered Zhuang Tinggui to be summoned to the police station. Zhuang presented the divorce agreement as proof. The court asked why the police report stated "separation." Tao replied that he reported "divorce" at the time. The court questioned Zhu Yundi, who denied ever mentioning the word "divorce" to the detective. When questioned, Zhuang Tinggui testified that a divorce had indeed occurred and that he was willing to accept punishment if he was lying. Judge Qian stated that the authenticity of the signature of the word "ten" by Zhu Yundi on the divorce agreement was being sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for verification. As the verification report had not yet been received, the case had to be adjourned. He ordered Zhuang Tinggui to provide 5,000 yuan in cash or a guarantor.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Manager - Accused of Embezzlement and Corruption</h3>
<p>Zhang Hesheng, the manager of the Hengtai Silk Factory on Henan Road, Zhabei, was recently accused by shareholders Zhang Peilin, Tian Xialin, Xu Liaoxing, etc., through lawyer Lu Qi, at the Procuratorate of the District Court. The accusation stated that the manager had engaged in extensive embezzlement and corruption soon after taking over operations, leading to the shutdown of the factory in September after only opening in May of this year. On the morning of the second of last month at 9 AM, the manager hired several trucks, led hooligans and his private associates Zhang Xinfu, Zhang Hequan, Chen Bingkui, Liu Xiniu, etc., and forced the handover of the factory's keys. They also destroyed the telephones, prohibited any movement of the factory's personnel, searched for and obtained the keys, and emptied the factory of its silk. They were about to move the remaining scraps when the landlord, pursuing overdue rent, intercepted two large bales of silk as collateral for the rent owed. Zhang Peilin, a shareholder who was also a director of the Weishi Association, learned that factory employees Zhang Huilin, Zhang Songfu, Fei Guorui, etc., had been detained and reported the incident to the authorities during a time of unrest. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the court. The court arrested Zhang Hesheng and released him on a 5,000 yuan bond with a guarantor. The detained employees also filed a private lawsuit with the Criminal Court against Zhang Hesheng, Zhang Xinfu, Zhang Hequan, Chen Bingkui, and Liu Xisheng for illegal detention. Yesterday, upon preliminary investigation by Judge Shao, he ordered each of them to provide a guarantor pending further investigation and interrogation.</p>
