<h3>團結力量之又一表現</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>魯省府主席韓復榘氏。於日前遄程蒞浙。與行政院蔣院長作正式之把晤。同時山西淸鄉督辦徐永昌氏。陝省綏靖中任楊虎城氏。冀察政委會秘書長戈定遠氏。亦復欵段命駕。不期而會於杭。雖諸氏之任務各有其所官稱。或則以職掌關係。請示剿匪之機宜。或則在　寄分內。報吿地方之政情。要之在今日華北形勢極度緊張之際。而重要負責人員。得藉時機之許可。作一堂之會晤。其足以喚起常人之注意者。影饗詎得云小。吾人所以於延頸企踵之餘。而樂寄以非常熱烈之同情也。</p>
<p>在張羣川越正在進行調整邦交聲中。而綏東之警訊頻傳。不逞之構圖日亟。背景若何。不難想像。吾人亦知隣人之慾壑。繼長增高靡有底止。自非以「威脅報威脅」。將莫戢野心於萬一。顧猶以為雙方誠意周旋之下。國際目光所注。雖具非分之貪婪寧無正義之顧慮。故今日綏東情况。縱極錯綜。而出面擾邊之匪衆。要猶屬於國內之不肖份子。明知幕後牽絲。自另有其主者。論其烏合之勢。固不難於撲滅。假令國內人士。均能檢點身手。以民族觀念自淬勵。勿輕易供人之利用。則目前一絲維繫。或猶不至遽破。懼在無恥漢奸。甘心作倀。挾其侵潤之故智。肆其脅迫之伎倆。使地方當局。寖入其彀中。要亦吾人之所深恫。此决韓徐等聯袂南下。與中樞要人作坦率之會見。至少可使吾人久蘊心頭之惶慮。得以消釋於無形。</p>
<p>吾人堅抉認定。非集中全國之力量。不足以禦侮而救亡。吾人亦堅决認定。在禦侮救亡之原則下。未有不可以臻全國於團結者。故團結為今日唯一之要務。而團結以後之大計。允為目前亟應確定之步驟。以粵桂已事之不易爬梳。而得於短時期內遽吿解决。卽為基於時勢之要求。不能不有團結之局面。以華北方面大員平日不常把唔。難免有意見隔閡之處。今得於杯盤酬酢之頃。從容互抒肺腑。可謂團結力量之又一表現。吾人於此。更能堅决認定。在形成團結力量之下。任何國難。未有不可以排除者。同時吾人亦可悟彼以威脅加我者。豈非正為促成吾國團結之原動力乎。</p>

<h3>白倫總理籲請　法人民陣线團結　支持政府俾實現政綱　勿授敵黨以可乘之隙</h3>

<p>總理謂、「對於吾人之所作為、好惡毀譽儘可不同、然吾人業已有所作為、此則凡屬正直君子均不能加以否認也、余今願提出一當前急待解决之間題、吾人當繼續工作吾乎、吾人是否仍將獲得國會原有之大多數擁護乎、是吾仍將由原有之政治社會集團加以支持乎、假令吾人將此問題付於國民加以判斷、則其答復當毫無疑問、蓋過去六月以來、人民陣綫之理想未嘗稍損、國民對於人民陣綫之熱情亦未嘗稍减、夫如是則吾人安可於此時復起分裂乎、抑人民陣綫之造成、雖係得自人民大衆之許可、然對於人民陣綫之內部結構及其存續時間、則若干人士猶不免表示懷疑、此在吾友黨已引起不安、而吾敵黨則更欲乘機施共產黨以攻擊、對於此種疑慮、余敢答之曰、倘有一黨退出人民陣綫、不復與政府以信任、則其結果惟有解散衆院舉行改選、以徵人民公意而已」、</p>
<p>總理繼述人民陣綫成立之歷史、謂「人民陣綫誕生於一九三四年二月六日巴黎暴動之日、法西斯團體實為產生人民陣綫之父母、彼時法西斯團體勢力頗為猖獗、因此志願保障民主自由之各政黨各團體、遂乃被迫而團結一致、蓋在法國歷史中任何時期、茍未獲工農大衆之和衷共濟、共和制度未有能獲有效之保障也、至於目前多數急進黨員所憂慮之問題、厥為合法秩序問題，蓋工潮起伏無已、工人常有盤據工廠情事、此層最為急進黨之所煩憂、余則以為欲挽救共和制度、首在繼續維持合法秩序、社會糾紛更迭不已、勢必使資產階級及農民聞而生畏、人民陣綫政府倘不克在精神上及實際上、恢復眞正之秩序、則勢將成為軟弱而無力矣」、白倫復稱、「假令共產黨退出人民陣綫以後、則彼反動份子深知社會黨本亦屬馬克斯主義者、其勢必再進一步、迫令社會黨退出人民陣綫、苟然、則將惟諸君（指急進黨）獨當其衝突」、</p>
<p>至是白倫乃陳述法國及歐洲一般之情勢、略謂、「兩年以前、歐洲分為民主政治與法西斯主義兩大壁壘、今則不然、若干人士現方力謀使歐洲分為獨裁政治及共產主義之兩大壁壘、此在法國則凡願望保持秩序者、均不復思及獨裁政治之一途、凡屬人民陣綫之任何政黨、均僅有唯一目的、卽在秩序與民主制度之範圍內、繼續企求進步是也、抑保障民主政治之發展、並由政治民主化以求社會民主化、此無他、僅依一七八九年法國大革命時代之原則、就現代社會之規模加以擴張已耳、在人民陣綫內部、各黨均應保持自主之權、但當應用此種自主權、以作各黨共同之努力、此兩者雖似相反而實相成」、結論則謂、「吾人當求澈底之改革、但此種改革、與財產制度並不衝突、吾人志在創造新社會、但其所用方法則僅係就現社會加以改良已耳」、白倫演說畢、全塲鼓掌歷時甚久、繼乃齊唱馬賽革命歌及國際歌、宣佈散會、（十八日哈瓦斯）</p>

<p>—魯迅：「這樣的戰士」是道樣倔强，這樣勇猛的一位戰士，他憎惡黑暗，討厭正人君子，猥瑣卑怯的「老中國」的兒女，愚昧而强蠻的統治者…用了一支辛辣無比的筆，給他們以剝露，攻擊，毫不妥恊，毫不餒怯一他被目為傳統社會的叛逆，反動份子，然而他却為無數靑年人和正義者所敬重，愛戴。</p>
<p>是這樣的一位戰士—我們的文學巨人魯迅先生，他在許多明槍暗箭中間，和一切封建的，黑暗的勢力戰鬥了一生，雖然他的精神還一點沒有衰老，現在却終於在昨天（一九三六年十月十九日）早晨五時，悄悄地離開這世間了。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>在十一點多鐘得到了魯迅先生的死訊，覺得有一股凉氣直從頭頂貫到足尖。出神似的呆了好一忽，祇覺得心裏空虛得厲害。</p>
<p>像這樣的一位戰士的死去，對於中國，我想那損失之大是無比的吧！—單是在中國新文化運動的短短歷史中，魯迅先生所寫的就是怎樣光明燦爛的一頁！</p>
<p>午後一點鐘光景，我和幾位同伴忽忽趕到北四川路××村的魯氏的寓所。沒有聽見一點哭聲，祇有一片嚴肅的靜穆和悲哀。魯迅夫人（許廣平女士）的眼睛有些紅腫，和幾位男女靑年正在沉默地用着午餐。這些人中間，有着魯氏的三弟周建人，「譯文」編者黃源，和靑年作家田軍等三們先生。</p>
<p>由黃源先生領導我們到了二樓魯氏的臥室，屋子並不大，魯氏的遺體就安祥地躺在靠左的一張床上，身上蓋了一條粉紅色棉質夾被，臉上也蒙着一張潔白的紗中。黃源先生把白中揭去了，眼睛就紅起來。魯氏的口眼都緊閉着，一頭夾着幾根銀絲的黑髮，濃濃的眉和鬚，面容難然瘦着一點，却並不怎麼難看。</p>
<p>大家屏息似的沉默着。心裏感到沉重的壓迫。</p>
<p>離床頭靠窗就是」張半新舊的書桌，上面雜亂地堆着些書籍，原稿，兩枝「金不換」毛筆挺然立在筆揷裏旁邊有一隻有蓋的瓷茶盅。這就是魯氏生前不知嘔去了多少心血的地方。現在顯得很雜亂。桌子橫頭是魯氏最近一篇文章裏曾經提到的籐躺椅。靠上一張方桌，滿滿的堆着書；床頭床脚各有架小小書櫃。壁上掛着些木刻和油畫，有一張好像是凱綏珂勒惠支（Kaethe　Kollwilh）女士的版畫，而一張則是油繪的嬰孩的畫像，上面題着「海鷹生後十六月肯像」字樣。—海鷹是魯迅先生唯一的愛兒，今年還不過八九歲，這天眞的孩子似乎還絲毫不懂人生的憂患，跳跳蹦蹦的十分高興。</p>
<p>看着這些東西，禁不住深切的感喟。這老年的戰士，我們的一代的文豪，如今是永遠離開我們了！</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>魯迅先生是浙江紹興人，原名周樹人。誕生於一八八一年，享年五十六歲。</p>
<p>近兩年來，魯氏病非常多，據說，他原是患着肺病，且患着橫隔膜炎的。今年夏天的一塲大病，會經使無數關心魯氏健康的人担心了一陣，然而後來却終於漸漸好了。祗是健康還沒有完全恢復。</p>
<p>曾經有許多人勸他離開上海，到日本，或者中國的別的地方去休養，然而他不願意。在精神稍稍康復時，並且又繼續了他的讀書和作文的工作。「從去年起，每當病後休養，躺在籐躺椅上，每不免想到體力恢復後應該動手的事情：做什麼文章，翻譯或印行什麼書籍。想想定之後，就結束道就是這樣罷—但要趕快做。這「要趕快做」的想頭，是為先前所沒有的，就因為在不知不覺中，記得了自己的年齡。」（魯迅：「死」，見中流」第二期。）—為着文化的工作，魯迅先生是這樣對付着他的有涯的生命的！</p>
<p>據說魯氏新近身體和精神都非常好，魯氏的太太和幾個接近的朋友都很高興。不久以前在上海舉行的全國木刻展覽會，魯氏也興冲冲地跑去參加了。</p>
<p>上星期六（十月十七日）魯氏會經到北四川路去跑了一趟，受了點冷，但精神仍然很好。晚間十一時，周建人先生從魯氏寓所離去的時候，他還非常快活。但到了兩點鐘，忽然父病倒了。病象並沒有什麼特異，祇是氣喘得厲害。</p>
<p>看了醫生，可是沒有效，終於在昨天淸晨五時，離開了人世。死時很安靜，並沒有什麼話遺留給家人。—他的「遺囑」却曾在近作「死」一天中提到。</p>
<p>魯迅夫人决定遵照着那遺囑的意旨替他辦理後事。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>下午二時左右，明星影片公司方面得到魯氏逝世的消息，由歐陽予倩，程步高，姚莘農先生引導到魯氏的寓所攝取了新聞影片。</p>
<p>魯氏的遺體，魯氏的寓所，連魯氏生前日常工作的書案，也由魯迅夫人按照平日的樣子給攝了紀念的電影。</p>
<p>不久，魯氏生前的友好陸續到了許多，都瞻仰了遺容。這些人中間，有許多是我們所熟知的著名的作家，如夏丐尊，巴金，趙家璧，孟十還，……等諸氏。</p>
<p>三時許，膠州路萬國殯儀館的車子來了，由幾個人將魯氏的遺體用白布裏着舁下樓來，許多人在後面沉默而悲哀地送着。田軍先生，這健實年靑的人，最初是低着頭在流淚，終於失聲地哭了起來。</p>
<p>盛殮的時間預定大概是今天晚上。魯迅先生的遺體，從今天晨九時到下午五時，就公開陳列在萬國殯儀館，預備一切敬仰先生的人們去瞻仰遺容。</p>
<p>治喪委員會已經組織了參加的是宋慶齡，蔡元培，茅盾，曹靖華，斯沫得萊（Al　Smedldy）內山等諸氏及魯氏的兩位弟弟，—周作人和建人先生</p>
<p>文化界方面，對於魯氏的逝世將有什麽紀念的辦法，此刻還不知道。—但對於這樣一位文化界的戰士，中國的一代文豪，總應該有一點什麽表示吧。雖然這並不為魯迅先生所願望。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>魯迅先生的進步的思想在中國靑年中的影饗，以及他的著作對於文化界的貢獻，我不想，事實上也不能够，用一支秃筆來替他記一點什麽。他的業蹟，是將永遠在歷史上發着不磨的光輝，他的卓瑩的人格，也將是一切革命者永久的典範。</p>
<p>關於魯迅先生的著譯的目錄，這裏根據極少的材料寫在下邊，時間太匆促，遺漏自然不免，祇好待以後有機會時再補正了。　甲·著作—吶喊，彷徨，朝華夕拾，故事新編，野草，熱風，華蓋集，華蓋續集，二心集，三閑集，而已集，兩地書，南腔北調集，偽自由書，准風月談，花邊文學，中國小說史略（上下冊），小說舊聞鈔，墳，唐宋傳奇集（十卷，輯錄並考正。），魯迅自選集，集外集。</p>

<h3>聖母院路　血案真相詳紀　係奸圖謀佔妻霸產　池文祥受愚險遭不測</h3>
<p>上月十四日夜間十一時、法租界聖母院路同康里三十八號亭子間內發生兇殺案、幸被害人力大抵抗呼救、未遭其害、兇手情急逃出、由該弄居戶幫同巡捕、追獲幫兇浦東徐永才一名、帶至捕房收押、一而將受傷人送往醫院醫治、翌日、捕房將徐解送特二法院訊押偵查在案、茲補紀此案</p>
<p>發生始末</p>
<p>緣被害人池文祥、即衡文秀、年二十九歲、浦東人、入贅於公共租界戈登路發昌漆作店主池姓、故更姓池、妻池文英、今年二十七歲與夫同居白克路能仁里七號、亦經營漆作業、因池家有房地產、故生活裕如、文祥妻有外遇、此次之慘禍、因姦夫圖謀佔人妻、圖霸財產而起、池文祥有表兄弟夏伯良、住霞飛路樂安坊十二號、在貝諦鎏路一四四號、</p>
<p>開店經商</p>
<p>與文祥不常往來、上月五日清晨、夏突至池家、對池妻池文英謂、有浦東曹家路口當區長之唐長安家、需油漆房屋、余來介紹生意、約定後日（六日）與唐之外甥徐金福偕同渡浦、至唐家接洽、翌晨、即由夏·徐·二人、偕池文祥渡浦、步行至中途、天色已晚、忽遇一便衣保衛團員來引誘、擬</p>
<p>中途下手</p>
<p>殺池、被池有破彼等形色不對、當夜折至夏家、過宿一宵、次晨、夏對池云、時間已晚、恐唐已赴上海、我們回滬後再通知接洽、遂相偕借返滬、至上月十四日午刻、池文祥接得徐金福之電話云、渠之娘舅唐長安、已到上海、約於下午二時、在重慶路西園茶館會見、屆時池往、遇徐金福、徐云、唐在大千世界對面同康里二十八號租</p>
<p>賃亭子間</p>
<p>房子、現因唐出外購物、少待再去會唐、斯時池約定當日下午六時、在大千世界申曲場等候約會、遂各分散、至下午六時、夏伯良·徐金福·同至大千世界、會見池文祥、遂云唐已在同康里等候、於是三人即離大千世界、赴同康里二十八號、夏伯良稱、別有要事離開、池與徐金福行抵同康里三十八號亭子間、懂見</p>
<p>鄉人摸樣</p>
<p>之徐永才、又名（徐銀泉、二十三歲、浦東人）係徐金福之族弟、房間中僅有板木與大樟木箱各一隻、別無他物、候至夜十時、仍未見唐長安來、由徐金福命池文祥睡在該處等候、於是即由徐永才關閉房門、熄滅電燈火、三人倒臥板床上、未幾池文祥朦朧入睡鄉、兩徐即持菜刀乘池睡熟砍池、池於睡鄉覺痛、黑暗中起身</p>
<p>極力抵抗</p>
<p>兇手於黑暗中將兇刀授池、池開窗拋棄、并大聲疾呼救命、兇手徐金福·徐永才·驚惶開門逃出、池滿身浴血、負傷下樓、至客堂中對二房東唐東生告以遇害情形、乃幫兇徐永才逃出、被住居同康里二十八號之蔡金財瞥見、迫至福煦路九星戲院、將徐永才擒住、交八零一號華捕、帶至同康里出事處、電話報告法捕房、即</p>
<p>召救護車</p>
<p>將受傷之池文祥送往廣慈醫院醫治、一面將兇手帶案、解送法院訊押、昨日由特二法院章朝佐推事蒞刑一庭續審、警務處律師顧守熙稱、本案偵查終結、因被害人之妻有外遇、通姦後、意圖佔妻霸產而謀殺、現依殺人未遂罪、對徐永才起訴、繼由被害人池文祥申訴被害經過、訊之徐永才供、由在逃徐金福邀我前往、我未動手、庭上核供、以案情複雜、論知改期二十七日再訊、並令承辦探員吳文綱下次須將案中關係人證、一併傳案候訊、</p>

<h3>考察歐洲體育的感想（上）</h3>
<p>— 江良規</p>
<p>（柏林通訊）十一屆世界運動會在柏林舉行、我國體育協進會除派遣大量代表團外、並有體育考察團之組織、鄰選全國體育界服務人員、來歐參加世界運動會、並且於大會閉幕後、赴歐洲各國中對於體育有特殊歷史或成績者考察、共費時十八日、歷丹麥·瑞典·捷克·匃牙利·意大利·奧地利·及德國等七國、考察範圍有社會體育、事校體育、及其他組織如靑年訓練、勞働服務團等、記者十二分的榮幸、得追隨於各體育界各士之後、共同前往觀光、可惜為時過於忽促、不免有走馬看花之憾、詳細的考察記、已於各國旅次寄發國內、可是所述的、都是一些實際情形的描寫、缺乏個人主觀的批評及感想、所以特地在這另外寫一點關於这次考察所所得的感想、和所解决的從前認為懷疑的問題、雖然各國的體育、皆有其不同的社會背境和政治主張、我們不能看判什麼就把牠全部的抄襲過來、然而在大體上說來、多少是可以作為他山之石的</p>
<p>（一）體育在學校課程中所佔的地位</p>
<p>這是任何國家一致的主張和原則、不論我們所到是法西斯的國家、或是民主的國家、在他們敎育部頒佈的條例裏面、總有這末一條說『體育不論在各級學校中、應佔所有課程的第一位』、德國在過去不久的時候、敎育部還新近公佈了一條法令、說『大學的課業裏面、體育是般重要的一課、學生體育成績惡劣者、予以留級或開除的處分』、這條法令、最初頒佈的時候、很受到一部份社會知名之士的反對、可是後來經過敎育部精密的測騐、實地調査結果、用客觀的事實來證明、『體育成績優良的學生、學業成績也是同樣的優良』的、所以德國敎育部事後說明、　條辦法、不但是不致於影響科學的進展、反而直接的加以促進於是一班反對派的敎授、也不再呶呶了、所以從這方面看來、在歐洲學校體育的注重、是他們全國政策的一種、我們冉看一看中國的學校體育情形、對於體育略加注意的人、誰都知道是『破產』『失敗』『等於零』、小學校裏的體育、充其量不過每星期一二小時的步伐、徒手操式遊戲、以正在如日初昇發育時代的兒童、每星期供給這末一二小時的運動、無疑地是少之又少、更何况還有一班失職的體育敎員、把這僅有的一二小時、呌上幾個一二一、向左右轉、就敷衍過去了、這簡直不是敎育、這是摧殘兒童、這是殘害整個民族的健康、再談到中學吧、那就更不成樣了、學生是點名不上課、或者是乾脆的沒有、倘而有幾隻對於體育少數認真的學校、可憐得很、真所謂絕無僅有、說到大學、那就完全可說是沒有、現在中國所謂的大學體育是什麼、充其量不過是大學校際的競賽？每個學校有一隊足球隊、籃球隊、常常出來賽幾回球、能够拿到錦標的、那就是成功者了、一般的學生、至少有百分之九十以上、是和體育不發生絲毫關係的、敎育部雖然也曾經三令五申的說『入學體育應列人正課』、可是結果、切實遵行的是當然談不到、陽奉陰違的都沒有、所以我們看、一個靑年、從小學以至大學、在這種體育環境下所建設的體格、那能不病態、衰弱、學校裏面、也許有幾個愛好運動的、結果是特殊階級的養成、只運動不讀書、與這種種學校體育的病態、危機、當然直接的、間接的包含着無數因子、交互演變的結果、可是我認為最大的問題、影響最烈者是『體育在各課程中的所佔地位的不重要』、因為不重要、所以體育敎員沒有地位、體育課程、不加注意、體育經費、减少移用、體育成績、無足輕重、種種的流弊、不一而足、所以我們希望、我們要大聲疾呼、你們辦敎育的人、你們的職責是「造成完美的兒童、但是你們不自覺你們過去听做的工作、是摧殘兒童、殘害兒童、你們要達到你們的目的、要盡你們的職責、就要改變你們過去錯誤的觀念、敎育兒童、要把體育放在最前綫、充分的利用、盡量的發揮體育在敎育上的價值、這樣趕快的回頭、也許還能亡羊補牢、挽回於萬一也、</p>
<p>（二）男女體育之異同問題道個問題在这次考察過程中、給予了我以滿意的答覆、從各方面的觀察、以及與各國體育界名士詢討的結果、我們所得到的結論、是「男女體育、在原則上、可以採取同樣的訓練方式」、我們見到許多女子、她們在體育方面的活動、能力並不低於男子、本來、男女有着同樣的求生能力、應該享受平等的受訓機會、過去一般人的錯誤、認為女子體力弱於男子、所以體育活應該和男子的不同、這是根本錯誤、要知道女子體能的低落、决不是病態、而是一種常態、女子體能低落的原因、大概的有兩種、甲、歷史的因素因為人類自從有歷史以來、一向都是男子為中心的社會、女子是始終站在附屬品的地位、所以女子永遠是被保護者、供養者、生活的競爭、衣食的獲得、一切的一切都由男子單獨的負責、女子旣然用不着操作、本能活動的機會就减少、於是逐漸的演進、體能自然漸漸的衰落了，所以女子體能的衰落、不是本能的傾向、而為受歷史影響的結果、假若我們還是繼續地不予女子以適當活動、那未將來也許會成了女子連路都走不動的現象、</p>
<p>乙、生理的因素第二種原因是生理的、女子生理上最足以影響其體能的、一是重心的降底、女子因為準備生育的關係、盆骨特大、所以下部重量增加、重心降底、行動不便、同時盆骨擴大、兩腿的傾斜度亦增加、擺動不易、此外如脂肪質多比重大、肌肉鬆弛等等、都是生理上的因素，影響　能者、</p>
<p>所以女子運動成績的不及男子、體力不及男子、並不是因為歷史和生理的原因所造成的結果、實際上男女的體格、並沒有區別、他們需要同樣的運動、同樣的訓練、當然、事實上、因為上述二種原因、在現在的時代、訓練女子的時候、决不能和男子有同樣的「分量、但是至少我們可以知道、男女體育在原則上是相同的」、</p>

<p>標紗前市開盤、因現紗抽緊、目本月份已離交割時期不遠，空頭抵補紛至沓來、市情急漲四元、遠漲二三元、二盤開拍、買勢再接再厲、再漲四元、十一月期形勢愈見驚惶步步猛跳十一兩個月已漲達停板程度、遠月氣勢略平、迨至收盤、聞現紗金城紗在漲十三四元、仍無現貨可買、塲中貿氣突熾、遠月復跳二元外、結果各月比上日收盤價近漲八元至八元八角、遠漲四元四角至四元半、午後開盤、近三個月買者仍湧、然賣戶殊稀、一度相持不下、仍柏黑板、十二月以下漲力仍强、二盤忽跌二元、詛料近月加價、仍無人賣出、遠月轉緊、跳起二元外、迨至收盤、聞現紗金城紗等又在漲、買氣奇濃、飛騰二元外、遠期一律穿出二百二十元關外結果各月比上午收盤價再漲四元一角至四元半、查賣出明德二千四百包、證記一千七百五十包、恒益六千包、大豐八千二百五十包、錦昌二千九百包、明華二千二百五十包、興昌二千〇五十包、豐泰一千七百五十包、仁豐三千六百包、元一一千二百五十包、潤康二千〇五十包、大昶一千一百五十包、生源一千三百五十包、福康五千一百五十包、晋康一千九百包、義成二千〇五十包、泰昌一千八百包、買進大豐二千四百五十包、通記三千五百五十包、德大一千〇五十包、大孚三千二百五十包、梅記二千二百五十包、裕大一萬五千三百包、振大五千包、瑞大三千四百包、森康二千七百包、同豐一千五百五十包、愼記六千一百包、益昶二千六百包、長豐二千二百包、信誠二千〇五十包、大昌成五千三百五十包、華懋一千五百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>廠需活躍　棉花亦見昂騰　棉紗暴漲差價日遠　空額過多反動劇烈</h3>
<p>棉巿本屬平疲、因大戶傾向拋售、壓迫殊重但因紗市暴漲、差價距離已遠、於是空方活動扒補、紗銷活潑、現棉廠需發展、各路產區棉價飛騰、由此檯面驟緊、市價乃靑雲直上矣、</p>
<p>棉花猛漲二元餘</p>
<p>標花前巿開盤、得紗市之助、而省日空方壓迫太急、故反動突起、各月漲八九角至一元、二盤平平、迨至三收盤、因紗價在跳、買氣更熾、近月又漲六角半、遠漲三·四角、午後開盤十月期空方活動抵補、漲二三角、遠月反跌一角、迨至三收盤、因紗巿緊俏萬分、再飛跳四·五角、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲五角至七·八角及一元、查賣出大豐一萬九千擔、元一四千二百担、晉康四千二百担、吉豐四千四百担、聚興四千四百担、源大三千四百擔、錦昌九千七百担、明德三萬二千八百担、慶大四千祖、明華五千担、長餘六千五百担恒德四千五百担、大昌成六千八百担、泰昌二萬〇二百担、潤康二萬五百担、恊成七千八百担、生源三千二百担、買進長和二萬五千八百担、源振　三千四百担、同和四千担、望泰興四千八百担、裕大五千八百祖、大孚一萬一千五百担、梅記三千七百担、通記一萬〇三百担、大實四千九百担、合興一萬二千五百担、興昌三千五百担、興記一萬四千担、元一八百五十担、畏豐一萬二千担大昶一萬〇二百担、永昌七千五百担、信誠八千三百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布銷售一空　各貨均創五年來新高價</h3>
<p>昨棉布市面、以現貨紗綫暴漲十餘元、標紗近月突漲八元停拍、布市因之緊張萬分、各類棉布一致飛漲、白貨以細布上漲最猛、（每疋）升四角半至六角半、細斜漲（每疋）自二角至五角、原布漲（每疋）一角至二角半、粗布漲（每疋）三角半至七角、絨布漲（每疋）四角之譜、藍布·漂布·士林布·色斜亦漲達四·五角、花色貨·直貢·嗶嘰、綫呢·斜花絨各達（每碼）二分左右致各貨均創五年來新高峯、昨各路添辦仍械活澄、廠家均以紗綫現貨無着、窘急萬狀、故對於新成交拒不接受、僅本埠號家略有手貨售出、十分居奇、惟日廠開出白貨龍頭等牌細布十二月份期貨、價較上週末增（每疋）四角之譜、各廠各號家存貨銷售一空云、</p>
<h3>糧食　麥價一往直前　入秋以來天氣乾燥行號客戶不顧脫脫各月激漲一角以外</h3>
<p>昨日期麥巿面、上午開盤、各月份突呈堅挺、以麥報份、雖仍小一二三角不等、不過目下到貨、勢巳漸减、且行客均一致扳住、不願輕脫、而天時入秋以來、晴多雨少、各處均感太旱、是以時局謠言雖漸平息、而因天旱、又引起人心之熱奮、各月份開價、均提漲五六七分、迨至下午開盤、因紗布市塲之激品在漲、又引起業外之興奮、各月份買氣因之更盛、價亦一往直前、毫無反顧、計一日間之漲、少則一角一分、多則至一角半之巨、照此情形、恐後步風波正多也、現麥巿面、各檔亦提漲六七分、開山東麥九元八角七分、蚌埠麥五元八角二分、瑤灣麥五元七角一分决七角、廣水麥五元六角二分、决五角八分、洋河麥五元七角半、南京麥五元五角、高郵麥五元七角、次六角四分、江北麥五元六角、由福新辦六千包、阜豐辦三千包、申大辦一千包云、</p>
<h3>小麥存底漸空　麺粉現空前高價</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤、各月份市面呈初平繼漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、仍續小一二三角不等、故開價時人心尙見平定、惟二盤以後、則以麥巿先漲、本外埠客帮　於天時太乾、恐須影響種植、致買氣大暢、逐步高提、迨至下午開盤、本月份因客胃又動、遠期各廠方不致預拋、小麥又值愈用愈空、致人心堅硬、又進一步、而時局　言、各方未免備糧、故巿氣之激昂、終不易平復、至各月份之市値、則巳達歷年朱見之最高價云、</p>
<h3>南北帮爭辦客秈　成交二萬一千包　行情激漲一二角</h3>
<p>昨日客幣市況、因客胃之突起活躍、市面又見興旺氣象、而全日成交數竟比上週六增加九倍、總計成交二萬一千五百包以上、而客胃似有繼續問津之意、故人心更為望好、當晨間開市時、承上週之疲滯氣象、一部份貨主仍有貶價求售、市價續見穱小、繼有粵帮突起暢辦糙砶米萬多、包而汕頭與北洋則爭辦機秈、本街胃口亦活、泉州亦有問津、行情乃激漲一二角、糙米更見挺佾、全日開贛米七千二百二十包、湘米一萬三千一百包、台秈二百包、沙糙一千包、</p>

<h3>黃豆來源近頗寥落</h3>
<p>黃豆巿况、因路局車輛缺乏、轉運不便、致一時來源寥落、而豫省年成、又豐歉不一、故巿塲人心堅昂、交易所標準豆價、先吿挺漲、現貨市價隨之帶緊、昨價較週末升漲三五分不等、去路仍由出口油廠本街等問津、統巿做開各豆四千餘包、維牛莊白眉豆一因好貨價高胃呆、二則大連市軟、聞牛莊白眉豆中可附運千餘包四平街豆、故大勢較其他各豆為疲、昨祗由本街辦去身豆豆二百三十包、價為五元八角三分云、</p>

<p>都市是人類生活的大熔爐，一切的摩天樓，洋房，汽車，刑庭，巡捕，交易所，俱樂部，舞廳，妓院，紅丸銷售處，大賭窟等等……它是早就了人，也殺害了人，它被人們憎惡，但也被人們歌頌著。</p>
<p>農村是人類生活資料的根源地，一切的米殼，麥物，蔬菜，果物，絲綢，棉花，等等，都從這個地方出來的，它供給了全世界人類的食糧和衣料，它是人類生活的基礎，可是，它現在卻到處鬧著饑荒，它更被都市的人們遺忘了。</p>
<p>我們在幻想，總有一天，把都市裏的鋼鐵，蒸汽，電流的交響，和農村裏的一切，配合調和起來，把都市裏所有的酗酒，歌唱，淫樂，都根本滅絕，把農村裏的所有飢餓，寒荒，完全解除。</p>
<p>人類來開始過著新的美滿的生活！</p>
<h3>家庭雛型展會觀後紀</h3>
<p>— 叔範</p>
<p>吳門周少甫先生，生前酷嗜巧藝，居嘗究刻楮礪核之技以為樂。又好壯游，客成都時，嘗見人骨編刻之圍裙一幅，穿珠鑲翠，妙同錦織，因歡中國古代工藝之神，為不可及；歸後，益閉門戶潛索，多方構製。繼覺為鵲無用，不如為車為轄之易使人知也；遂招匠人數輩窮年督為家居日用之器，惟妙惟肖，刻意神似；故方丈之內，舉凡牀衾凡案，書畫杯盤，下至塵帚溺器，可使羅陳無遺。民二十二，曾舉列芝加哥博覽預展會，獲優等獎狀。無何，先生捐館，爾許妙搆，悉付塵封。今由其嗣君樂山，略加整理，全部陳展於大新四樓，余神慕已久，一昨得悉賞覽。計分類凡七：曰家祠，祭器最　屬焉。曰閨房，微如鈿盒，無勿陳焉。備應對哀弔之具者，為廳事，為喪儀。羅笙管宴博之樂者，為醮壇，為遊艇。至黌廚一室，盛張甑孟刀箸，尤妙若親廝養給役，此中人坐臥行談，靡不各肖其狀；度之，皆不盈尺，然映以豆杯掌幾，剛適稱也。且細騐陶瓷金石，則又篆欸勒額，無一非真，細器浩工，驚詫結舌，－據主事者言：廚舊置有醃腿一，係取諸孕豕腹，刖後由東白人料量紫硝以成者，農年　被竊，猶深惋歡。又醮壇內道經一卷，著墨細埒蠅足，亦遭篡去，至今欲補，苦無聖手。余因即以賴子心雲為介，心雲作楷，有須彌納芥之工，甚望能全此妙品也。</p>
<h3>書店人語</h3>
<p>— 苕狂</p>
<p>為了要買幾本書，偶然走到四馬路，踏進了一家啟明書店。見他們的規模雖是不甚大，卻佈置得很是井井有條，店員也很為和氣；因大家談話起來。在這談話中間，似乎又幾點，倒有一記的價值的！</p>
<p>『你們的書賣得這般便宜，這不是一折八扣書的一個變相嗎？』我問。</p>
<p>『是固是；但我們所走的方向卻不同：我們不贊成翻印那些無聊的小說，卻是想提倡一點新文學的；所以在這第一批發行的三十中書中，那一種不是世界文學名著！——什麽小婦人，愛的教育，……幾本好一點的書全都在內！此外還有一種新文學書刊，創作小說，劇本，詩，一概都有，差不多把近人的名作都網羅無遺了！』一個青年店員如數家珍地回答。</p>
<p>『如此甚好；那成本一定是很大的？』</p>
<p>『成本當然大一些；這不是比翻印那些無聊的小說，取了來印就是了——我們也但有我們的方法。』</p>
<p>『什麽方法？』</p>
<p>『無非是把開銷減得其無可低；』他含笑回答，『好在在這裡的，一個個都是青年，抱著一顆勇敢的心，向著前面直闖，待遇如何工作時間如何，都不在心上，以為祗要如此，定能得到一個很好的結果的！』他疏導這裏，氣量是很不凡的了。</p>
<p>『你們肯如此實心實力地做，想來生意一定是很好的？』我不免恭維一句。</p>
<p>『生意確是不錯；祗是為了成本較巨，定價又廉，譬如人家買了一千本就可撈回本的，我們卻非加上數倍不可了！—然而我們卻願如此的幹，因為至少再買主方面，一定很是同情於我們的！』</p>
<p>我退了出來，細想到這　一番答的話，覺得中間雖不免有些標榜的性質；然而在這商戰劇烈的時代，這倒也不失為新發明的一種生意眼，正可給別個店家看個樣子的！因而紀之如右。</p>
<h3>上海人之衣</h3>
<p>— 薑公</p>
<p>『三世做官，纔懂得穿衣喫飯，』從這兩句俗語，可以知道以前研究漂亮衣服的，只限於一般世家子弟，現在則大大的不然了。</p>
<p>江浙兩省的人，尤其是蘇杭一帶，看得穿綢著緞，非常稀鬆平淡，別處卻當做一件了不起的事情。記得我幼時住在武昌，親眼看見，除了做官的人間，就是家道殷富的商人，倘非有婚喪喜慶或重要的宴會，身上輕易不肯穿著絲織品，富家子弟，直到二十歲上下，冬天偶然穿了一件皮袍了，就不免被大眾在背後恣意的譏評，說『不怕燒壞了嫩骨頭！』，北平，雖然是歷代建都的地方，民間習慣，亦復如此。秦晉等處的人，素來以賦性吝嗇出名的，那更不消說得了。試看許多西北簌的要人，身處富貴榮華之境，依然終年穿著大布之衣，這也祗是我行我素，並非有意矯揉造作啊。南北風氣奢侈儉樸之分別，相去真不可以道里計呢！</p>
<p>上海人崇尚虛榮，最喜歡裝潢門面，不問自己的環境如何，財力如何，祗一味的考究衣著，把身上竭力打扮得花團錦簇，好像天天在做新郎，人人都是翩翩佳公子。就是每月祗有十餘元薪資的小店員，家境貧寒的工人茶役，終日在外面遊蕩的無業遊民，也都渾身上下內外，從貼肉的短衫袴啊，到夾衣的裏子，完全用綢質做成的；飯可以不喫，而衣服不可不做，情願因此借債舞弊，做不名譽的行為，添精神上的痛苦，甚或受法律的制裁，一概不甚愛惜無所顧忌，『自古貪夫殉財，烈士殉名，』不料上海人卻祗知道殉衣，真所謂一蟹不如一蟹了！</p>
<p>然而他們的這種政策，也許是出於萬不得已，一點兒也不錯的。人們要想在上海活動著，的確不能不夠不這樣辦。因為上海自有許多俗物，心腸最勢利，眼皮最淺，是祗認衣衫不認人的，如果身上沒有一件值錢的衣服，那就狗眼看人低，要被他們輕蔑鄙笑得一錢不值咧！</p>
<p>世俗形容一種『打腫臉充胖子』的人，常用『穿的身上，吃的在肚皮裏』這兩句話，現在的上海人，卻差不多，可以說是『吃的在身上，穿的在肚皮裏』呢！男子們尚且如此，女人更可想而知了。（夫歲報載，有一少女，因欲製新衣，不能如願，便悲忿自殺，這真是摩登烈女，能以身殉衣，死有重於泰山者矣！）</p>
<p>不過，前幾年間，新花樣的衣料，往往要賣到四五元一尺，大眾尚爭先恐後的去購買，近來綢緞狂賤，各商店競以不願血本忍痛犧牲為號召顧客的工具，犧牲品每尺祗賣幾分錢，而定做新衣的反寥寥無幾，這並不是上海人對於衣的熱度，忽然低減，恐怕最大原因，還是由於民眾的經濟枯窘，業已達到『捉襟見肘』的最後階段了吧！</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　手足情高匿函憐弱妹　詩書氣重窺影笑寒儒</p>
<p>友梅說著就放下了傘，斜側了身子坐在一把竹椅子上，把光是隨時可以看到國器嚴子裏去。同章老太閒談了一會了卻不聽到那邊屋子裏，有蚊子呌的聲音。心裏也就想著，那必然是國器不在家。恰好女樸將陰綠色的大瓷杯，送了一杯菊花茶過來友梅接著喝了一口，見輩子上是堆花的雙龍戲珠，因笑道：這必定是表哥用的東西。我這種俗人，用他那雅致的東西，未免把東西糟蹋了。章老太坐在他對面的籐椅上，先向門簾子裏看了一眼然後笑對友梅說道：他雖然事事都愛個乾淨整齊，可是他對人是不分什麽界限的。我們現在僅有一碗飯吃。以前是更清寒的了不得，我們實在也不許瞧不起，李小姐，你說是不是？友梅道：那是當然的。表哥不但為人很好，就是他的文章作了出來，也是那樣令人羡慕的。比如我們的同學，在雜誌上看到了他的文字，也紛紛的議論他為人。有的也猜得對。有些也猜不對，我聽了就好笑。有一個人，那簡直是忠實的信徒。只要摘掉那本雜誌上有表哥的文字，他一定買了去看，碩到這裏，鐺的一聲，由房裏傳了出來。分明是宣紙的銅尺，落在地上，打了這麼一下響。於是吃了一驚道：什麽？表哥在家嗎？說著又微微的一笑。章老太笑道：他在家也不要緊，你又沒有說他什麽的壞話。你不要看他自小就進的新式學堂，但是他總時髦不起來。他見了男子是很大方的，他見了女人，比姑娘見了男人還要小器。友梅同章老太說話，眼光又向簾子裏看了幾次，果然看到一個白影子晃了兩晃。便呌道：表哥在家用功呵！沒有得著你的許可，我又不便進書房來奉看。國器在房子裏答道：對不起。我因為趕著做一篇稿子，做完了，我就出來奉陪。友梅道：請你自便我又不算客，還有伯母陪著呢。於是轉過臉來向章老太低聲道：這樣熱的天，他一個人，關在屋子裏還這樣的文縐縐地，未免詩書氣息太重一點。說時，皺了眉頭子帶些苦笑。章老太笑道：本來不應當這樣，我就常說他是一個書呆子。（八八）</p>
<h3>秋興隨筆</h3>
<p>— 吳吉八</p>
<p>屣家漕涇逾一年，海上知友，漸少往還，邇以襄贊萍君，乃日復僕僕於靜安漕渡間，偶憧畏友胡文清兄寓邸相距密邇，遂於散值後走訪。</p>
<p>胡兄經理勝德織造廠已多載，精明幹練，肯負責任，素為廠中顧兆楨先生所依臂，顧蘇人，二十餘年前，營花邊於鬧市，值歐戰，外貨告絕，遂集資創勝德，苦心孤詣，經之營之，不數年出品精良，行銷全國及南洋，更事擴展，就小沙渡路自建廠基佔地二十餘畝，添置巨型機器，出貨速爾益精，為國製新工業放異彩，所造花邊，新花疊出，且駕舶來而上之，又賽珍出品，亦能自造原料，分銷令製電木儀器工廠，於是獲利倍屣。</p>
<p>年來市面不景，該廠雖亦舉影響，但根基雄厚，尚能維持，邇日（十月一日起，一個月為期，年常舊慣矣。）舉行建廠二十二週紀念展覽會，特開巨室，陳列各種出品，大事減價，以資紀念，而本年復與美亞織綢廠各作陳列，藉使顧客來購格式新奇花邊後，可無再勞配料之跋涉，昨愚訪胡之頃，承引往廠中參觀展覽室，電矩通明，花色繽紛，目不暇接，就中針部內包含梭織，錠織，染色等部，即胡兄主政者，尚有賽珍一部，為國產輕工業之首創，經理李君，亦蘇人，所製各式繽木用具，五花八門，名目繁多，不及備述愚去之日，雖風聲未弛，而遊覽者仍見擁擠，尤以新出『鴛鴦邊』一種，正為一般時髦闔伴所歡迎，裁綴衣周，別有丯神，宜其行銷　　間矣。</p>
<p>此日外侮亟矣，遍考國中各工廠，能自造原料，抗禦舶來者，寥若晨星，勝德能獨樹標幟年銷一百餘萬之貨品，響為外人側目。願有心人起而振奮，予故樂為之記。</p>
<h3>鹹水妹是譯音</h3>
<p>— （郭振方）</p>
<p>三日本刊鹹水妹。謂「海水是鹹的，伊們都在海上作生意，所以四做鹹水妹。」雖則頗似言之成理，然而終覺牽强得厲害，</p>
<p>據我所知：鹹水妹乃Hand　some　Maid的譯音，猶之德律風，（電話）馬達卡，（汽車）色老夫，（跑街）康白度（買辦）等，是一樣的。未能照字面來解釋，否則便攢進牛角尖去了。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>萬國公墓中</h3>
<p>— 霞飛</p>
<p>偶然的，不知是一個什麽意念闖上了自己這幽寂而孤悶的心頭，讓自家兒的身體像一張秋風中的落葉般，在這深秋的晚風中飄著，茫然地，無目的地飄著。</p>
<p>夕陽範罩下的都市，像一幅雄偉美麗的油畫，大都會的動脈，在跟著人們的心弦而緊張，跳顫；街頭，那些背著十字架的人，像失去了靈魂似的在這生活的洪流裏掙扎！</p>
<p>許多電車，汽車，公共汽車，仿佛是池中的遊魚般在靜安寺前兜著圈子，那立體式的建築，和蛛網似的電線，已經啟示著我：這裏也揭起了繁榮都市的標幟。雖然，這裏還有一個古老的靜安寺存在著，可是卻並不曾因此而減少了它近代的尊嚴。現在，那兒也一樣地有活劇的演出，有罪惡的製造，有流線型的汽車，有生活線上的掙扎者，有趾高氣揚的紳士，有流浪街頭的失業人，有桃色的美夢，有灰色的故事……那是東方巴黎的斷面，那是東方蒙托卡羅的邊緣。</p>
<p>自己想著，走著，不知怎麼一個機緣，我竟闖入了那個雅靜穆的萬國公墓。</p>
<p>那是一片人生歸宿的淨土，這裏所提示給人們的，只是一種幽秘而解脫的意味。雖然人生誰也免不了要踏進這個最後的階段，但不論英雄美人，聖賢名士，到最後來還不是黃土一塊，白骨一堆，然而到了數百年之後，我想也許會連這一塊黃土，一堆白骨都沒有找處吧！所以，我覺得現在設上這土阜石碣，也未免多此一舉。</p>
<p>人生儘管是矛盾的，他們有些人時時在恐懼著死神的降臨，但是同時也有些自以為聰明的人反而時時刻刻在替自己掘著墳墓，我不知道這些人中，誰是真正的傻子？</p>
<p>萬國公墓，它是一塊上海各國人的埋骨地，我相信這些十字架或石碣下面一定壓著我們敵人的殘骸，也有我們朋友的靈魂；然而以前我雖則也常常在這兒經過，但從沒有對它注意過，今天，我居然竟會闖進了這個所在來，那真是出乎我自己意料之外的一個奇蹟。</p>
<p>我非常愛這地方，因為那兒不但環境靜穆嚴肅，而且風景也極幽雅美麗，綠蔭蔽空，軟草如茵的，很能使人流連忘返，雖然那兒沒有公園那麼佈置得池沼亭台，花卉叢林的修理井然，但是當我們置身其間時，卻可體會到別有一種況味。</p>
<p>這裏間的地方很大，縱橫的豎著許多記載人民的石碣，和十字架，旁邊一隻長方形的石盤，裏面鋪滿著石子，每一個墓前都放著一些鮮花，四邊都留著人行的小徑，那些蔥蘢的樹木便排列在人行道的旁邊，許多無名的野花卻寂寞的點綴在中間；在這夕陽斜照，暮色蒼茫中，這片集團的墓地更顯得淒涼暗淡了。</p>
<p>獨自個兒在這裏向行著，使我想起了人生的空虛，意識到幻滅的寂寞，會引起我解脫而超然的人生觀念；於是一種淡淡的哀愁，便像秋寒似的蒙上了我的意識。</p>
<p>突然，樹木上飛來了一羣雀子它們在林間枝頭飛著噪著，充滿了和樂愉快的空氣，頓使這凝固著的靜穆起了裂痕。它們多麼活潑，多麼自由，然而我們自命為萬物之靈的人類，反而處處失卻了自由，失卻了活潑，只在痛苦的重壓下哀號呻吟著，思想起來，豈不令人愧然！</p>
<p>濃重的暮露漸漸地低下來了，一縷最後的陽光已從聖母堂的尖頂上收斂了去，於是，我也祗得懷著一個悵惘的心裙，悄然地踏上了歸途。</p>
<p>新家庭與衛生</p>
<p>— 沈兆荃醫師主編</p>
<h3>今日中國最大之危機！</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>中國今日所處之境地。其危機之嚴重。未可以言語形容。外而東虎西狼。强鄰偪處。內而天災匪禍。瘡痍滿目。正如一葉扁舟。飄蕩於驚濤駭浪之中。時有傾覆之虞。然而國勢危急。雖為莫大之慘重。猶未為吾中華民族之大患。惟吾人身體衰弱。實為最大之危機也。</p>
<p>夫國家為人民之集合體。加入組成國家之個體。素質堅强。則縱然此國家之組織破壞。吾人尚有重新組織之可能。假設人民之身體衰弱。始有萎靡不振。態度清極。繼而百病叢生。苟延殘喘。則民族之生產率銳減。死亡率激增。似此情形。則當前不能擔任艱鉅。將來必日就消亡。</p>
<p>吾國人民體格之衰弱。逐漸嚴重。尤以近數年來為甚。觀夫本屆世界運動會。我國各代表之失敗。奉半由於體力之不足。即此一端。已足與吾人深刻之注意及猛省者也。試一考察今日之學校。則學生患病者甚多。曾有某校施行健康檢查。則患病與不健康者竟佔百分之八十。而健全無病者僅佔百分之二十。若全國學校之學生。其健康之比率皆與此校相同。則大多數之青年皆為衰弱者。於是中國之前途殆矣。試就表面推測之。中國四萬萬之人口。將有過半數為患病及衰弱者。其與民族前途之危險為何如耶？</p>
<p>再考察各機關之辦事員。多現身心萎落。活力低微狀態。此等衰弱之人。於服務時。極易疲勞。不及數小時。即感覺頭暈眼花。腰酸背痛。因而精神萎頹對職務處繁衍因循。曠時缺席。辦事效率。大減特減矣。又吾人試一竚立通衢之旁。細觀往來行人。多為面黃肌瘦。體質羸弱之狀態。其中體格肥碩與精神健全者幾稀。如此。我國以衰弱民族組織之國家。欲抵禦外侮。誠難矣哉。故今日中國之危險。外侮不足懼。災禍不足憂。惟吾人體格之衰弱。乃為最大憂患也。大凡腦力不健之人。其智慧必弱。精神必衰。於是。而勇敢之美德。亦將消滅殆盡。由此觀之。則國家之與衰。與民族之存亡。其癥結所在。吾人可得而知之矣。</p>
<h3>健康之培養</h3>
<p>凡欲增神經之活力。與促進一般的健康與生機。第一要修養精神。避免心身過勞。行有規律之生活。夜早眠。晨快起。冷水摩擦。到戶外行適當之運動。禁食一切到斡性之物品。整理大便。對於房事。更當抑制。勿使過渡。如又手淫惡癖者。尤欲戒絕。此外同時須服用神經强壯劑。方能迅速痊愈。還復健康。</p>
<p>吾人之精神與體力。均有腦筋產生。吾人欲强壯神經。健全體力。必須滋補其腦筋。因腦為全體神經之樞紐。—一健百健。—一弱百弱—故補腦即為强壯神經之基礎。亦係除弱為强健全身心之要訣也。此種强壯與滋補神經之藥物。依據各國醫師實驗報告。首推德國强克生物大藥品之「米美爾補腦汁」Memory　Neuralic最有特效。對於神經衰弱各癥如頭痛。腦漲。眩暈。健忘失眠。記憶薄弱。思想滯鈍。精神萎頹等。無不藥到病除。患者服用後。直覺頭腦清爽。思想靈敏。精神愉快。體力强健。元氣倍增。生機蓬勃—儼若憔悴之樹木得甘霖而出長之氣概。故世界醫師一致稱許「米美爾補腦汁」為培養健康之源泉。國人如欲去弱國强。則以常服此藥為適合也。</p>
<h3>氣喘病除根治療實驗錄</h3>
<p>— （英國哮喘病治療月刊）DR.A.BERT.報告　沈兆荃譯</p>
<p>氣喘又名哮喘。俗謂痰飲。此癥自古難治。現代雖醫學昌明。但根治之特效藥。尚未發明。凡市間販賣各種氣喘藥品。大多數以含有麻醉作用。祗見效一時。實無除根痊愈之可能。且此等藥物。不宜常用。若每發即服。往往有成癮之流弊。故非安全療法也。余臨診餘年。遇有本病。亦僅採用對癥療法而已。欲施根治。則感棘手。極為困難。</p>
<p>近來自德國HumbertM.D.醫學博士發明內分泌聯合製成之氣喘特效藥Holipin（哮立平）以來。全歐醫界。莫不爭相採用。幷於雜誌報章中。著論介紹。同聲讚揚。咸認（哮立平）為氣喘根之特效治療劑。於是余亦隨而應用。歷來在臨床治療氣喘患者。不下二百餘人。所得成績。確甚美滿。茲就診餘之暇。摘錄一例於左。</p>
<p>患者B.W.君。四十七歲。（五金業）</p>
<p>（主訴）身體素弱。平時痰多。易罹傷風。自前年秋間。忽發哮喘。初起時約二三月發一次。迄至去年冬季。則病勢加劇。每月必發一次或兩次。且時間延長。苦惱更甚。</p>
<p>（病狀）發作時間。常在深夜。突然呼吸困難。氣阻息澀。不能就枕。或坐或立。以舒其氣。顔面蒼白青紫。發鼾聲如笛音。其聲甚高。稍近即能聞。發作之初。咳嗽並不甚著。迨至四五日後。呼吸困難始漸遼。於是乎咳嗽較多。而咯出粘稠透明之痰。癥狀之見輕快。恢復常態。</p>
<p>（診斷）氣管支哮喘Bronchialasthma</p>
<p>（療法）令嚴守一般攝生法。於發作時頓服。Holipin（哮立平）三片。約十數分鐘。癥候即見輕快。隔二小時後。再服三片。則覺咯痰稀鬆。呼吸困難全還。遂回復健康狀態。自後於間歇期內。每日服用三次。每次兩片。如此療續三月。即告痊愈。且至今半載有餘。未曾復發云。由此可知。（哮立平）確能根除氣喘。並非虛偽也。</p>
<h3>月經不調　不能成孕</h3>
<p>— 陳和貞女醫士</p>
<p>生人之道。始於求子。求子之法。莫先調經。每見婦人之無子者。其月經必或前或後。或多或少。或紫或黑。或淡或凝而不調。不調則氣血虧損。不能成孕。</p>
<p>就吾人臨床治療經驗。最常用『美奴甯』Mencrrin一藥。本品為專治療月經不調之聖劑。曾經各醫師臨床試驗證明。其效能調經種子。活血補血。且見功迅速。婦女不論有病無病。服之可保健美。青春得以永駐。</p>
<h3>男女青年　怎樣解去內心的煩悶？</h3>
<p>— Dr.G.Courteble.　方視同醫師譯</p>
<p>嫩綠的葉子，發出來的時候，在活潑的青年的內心裏潛伏著人們所不知道的苦惱…日夜的悶憂著；而最使元氣旺盛的青年所苦惱者，恐怕是生殖器的機能障礙吧！—什麽麼是生殖器機能障礙？在男子一方面，大概是陰莖短小，腎萎，早洩，夢遺，漏精等癥。在女子一方面的，為性慾異常，快感缺乏，性交時的痛苦，同時幷發現月經不正（行經前後的腹痛，經期不是超前就是落後，經水過多或者過少，甚至於經閉不行）帶下頻多等癥侯。無論夫妻任何一方，若患生殖器機能障礙諸病的結果，定能破壞其家庭的幸福，而演成種種的悲劇…………</p>
<p>患者生殖器機能障礙的人，同時並有極厲害的精神的煩悶，終日苦惱，鬱鬱不樂，意氣消沉，減退氣力，如此即逐漸陷入劇烈的神經衰弱的狀態；頭重，眩暈，頭痛，失眠，耳鳴，疲勞倦怠，記憶力減退，精神不安，腰背部酸痛，總而言之，是成了一個百病纏身—毫無生氣的廢人。罹患生殖器機能障礙者大多數是先天虛弱和神經質之人。其主要的原因；即無論男女，多犯過過度的手淫，因而陷入此不幸的病癥。又有因為房事過度，或在花柳病經過之後，或由於身心腦力的過勞等，而致發生此癥的，也確實不少。</p>
<p>關於生殖器機能障礙的治療方法，依據各專科醫師的經驗，欲挽救男性的生殖機能障礙，宜服用德國內分泌製劑「還爾童」Wel　Tonic强精補腎。效力超羣。女性機能障礙和月經不調諸癥，宜服用『美奴甯』Menorrin可使性的機能健全，月經恢復正常。氣血旺盛。保持健美狀態。這是世界醫師最推獎的兩種藥品，用以治療男女兩性的生殖器機能障礙，都很有驚奇的效果，如其依著本身的病狀，經過相當時期的服用，其機能上的障礙一定可以除去，自然就能營正常的夫婦性生活了。</p>
<p>神經衰弱—是毀滅吾人生命力的惡魔；在治療上應與生殖器機能障礙同等看做一個重要的問題。所以在治療生殖器機能障礙的時候，必須並用滋養强壯神經的藥劑，各國醫師都推獎『米美爾補腦汁』Mennory.Neurotic有返弱為强的權威。本劑不限男女，都可服用普通連服用二三星期後，就顯出昭著的效果；精神活潑，元氣倍增，頭腦明晰，心智爽快，思想靈敏，食慾亢進，全身的健康狀態自然恢復。從此以後，內心的煩悶解除了，就可以重享人生的幸福和樂趣。</p>
<p>肺病講座</p>
<p>— 沈兆荃撰述</p>
<h3>冬季為療肺之好時期</h3>
<p>社會上常有以為冬季為不適於肺病之謬見。其實冬季反為療養之好時期。因冬季氣候之特點。有爽冷•乾燥•晝夜氣溫之相差較少。皆對療養上為有益者。所以在北歐寒冷地方之療養院所有報告。以冬季治愈肺病之成績為最佳。</p>
<p>調節衣服。行各種强練法。可以避免寒冷預防感冒。爽冷而乾燥之空氣。能增進身體之活力。故食慾常在冬季能改善。病者不應放過此自然之好時期。澈底的實行諸療養法。如在自宅實行經濟的自療者。可複用臟器所製之肺活Phith　Weal。方為合理。對其他鈣製劑或一切化學藥品。不宜亂投。因效力微博而副作用反大。不如臟器製劑『肺活』Phith　Weal之根據。而安全公認也。</p>
<p>在此時期。患者如服用臟器製劑之『肺活』Phith　Weal安心療養。能使進行性著變為停止性。熱度下降。咳痰稀少。食慾增進。精神愉快。體量加重。肺活量强大。抵抗力旺盛癆菌終被天然之體力所尅服。得以痊愈。且於冬季療養者服用『肺活』Phith　Weal之效果。尤為顯速。並為天然的根本治愈。患者切勿錯過此良好之時期。</p>
<h3>肺病與神經衰弱</h3>
<p>世界學者多以肺病非僅為一種單純的細菌病。尚且為一種神經病。雖為過甚之辭。但實際上肺病患者。確有神經過敏。神經衰弱等癥。茲述其理由如下。</p>
<p>（一）肺病患者。多於發燒之前。由遺精。手淫。與房事過度等原因。致發生神經衰弱。而成為肺病者。故肺病與神經衰弱之關係甚密。</p>
<p>（二）因結核毒素之侵害神經。并使頭腦之營養不良。故易引起神經衰弱癥。</p>
<p>（三）因患肺病。受精神上之打擊。常存死亡之恐怖。孤獨。悲傷等。以至於神經衰弱。</p>
<p>（四）因療養費不足。及其他物質上之不安。使身心過勞。為神經衰弱之原因。</p>
<p>（五）肺病患者常受社會上冷酷之待遇。易於憤恨。致起神經衰弱。</p>
<p>綜上所述。可知肺病聊養法完全相同。即在精神肉體兩方面。將從前不良之習慣。率行擯除。用修養功夫。實行生活之革新。因前述第一項而起之精神衰弱。其療法在遺精未痊愈者。須服『福郎』固精片Fonan止其遺洩。手淫與房事過度者。宜用補腎强精之『還爾童』Well　Tonic內服。可滋陰補腎。增加元氣。挽救虛萎。對第二項所述由結核毒素作用而起之神經衰弱。須施行根本治療。例如服用『肺活』Phith　Weal使病變停止。消滅癆菌為重要。對前述第三。四。五等項所起之神經衰弱。須注意修養。努力克已避去精神上不良之影響。最為要緊。</p>
<p>依據近世學著之實驗。凡肺病患者。不論輕重。大都倂有神經衰弱現象。路頭重。頭痛。眩暈。健忘。失眠等癥候。故於肺病聊養法上。除服於根治藥『肺活』Phith　Weai以外。應同時兼用神經補劑。尤以『米美爾補腦汁』Memory　Neurolic最為有效。故近今肺病之服用補劑者。均棄魚肝油。鐵。鏻。鈣等補品而不用。一致改服神經補劑之『米美爾補腦汁』。能收事半功倍之效果云。</p>
<h3>肺病與痰咳</h3>
<p>—濫服用止咳藥之危險—</p>
<p>痰為何物。蓋患部之分泌物。亦即肺結核之膿也。此膿中含有多數之結核菌（又名癆菌）。若留於肺胞內。不將其咯出。病變將有再加擴大之虞。</p>
<p>氣管之內膜。本有纖毛上皮細胞。生有狀如刷毛之織毛。此織毛上皮之擺動。若祗有少許之痰。在氣管內時。固可自然將其推出。倘逢有多量之痰。則頗不易為力。尤以結核病變部所生之痰。粘力甚强。單恃織毛運動之力。殊不能將其悉數排出。於此不能不有一方法。將此粘痰排出。此即咳嗽之所由起也。故咳嗽作用。為排除於身體有害之痰。若為輕度咳嗽。在生理上本天然自衛有益之作用。倘患者濫用止咳藥劑。將咳嗽强加壓止。而妨害其自衛之機能。實為有害。是以肺病病人之濫用止咳藥劑。頗為不當也。</p>
<p>痰之性質。其白色之薄痰。多為氣管內所分泌。其黃褐色之濃痰。則可視為結核病變部所生。在療養結過中。痰之自然減少著。顯係其膿逐漸減少。亦即病已漸漸輕減。濃痰變為薄痰。膿黃色痰變為白色薄痰。亦顯係病勢減輕。一般痰之減少。膿痰之消失。咳嗽亦自然減少。亦即為病之減輕。自方面而言。療養患者有痰。即為病勢尚未停止之證。在有咳嗽之間。顯然結核菌尚未停止活動。應徹底勵行空氣安靜之療養。與臟器製劑之「肺活」Phith　Weal按法內服。可以早日將病勢遏止。由該咳嗽無待壓止。而能自然消失。始為根本治療之方法也。</p>
<h3>青年病之挽救</h3>
<p>— 陳志成醫師</p>
<p>青年所患最多者。其惟性病乎。而尤以遺精。早洩。腎萎。患者尤多。不惟身體日漸虧損。神經日漸衰弱。且子嗣絕望。壽命夭促。非速就著名可靠之正式醫師治療不可。至於用藥方面。尤須格外注意也。</p>
<p>方視同醫師為專治性病之能手。對於遺精。早洩腎萎各癥。臨診獨多。精要宏富。經起診治者。莫不手到病除。霍然而起。其所賞用之性病良劑。如『福郎』Fonan固精片及『還爾童』Well　Tonic。早著盛譽克奏最美滿之效果。此等藥品。在滬上永安公司西藥部及各大藥房。全國各大藥房亦均有經售云。</p>
<p>編者按—方視同醫師—在上海北浙江路東首海甯路克能海路口（市民療養院）內應診。全日施診。祗有號金二角。對於男女性病。以及花柳。戒煙等。均可負責治愈云。</p>

<h3>細菌戰爭之研究（上）</h3>
<p>— 李令棟</p>
<p>—在世界大戰襲擊之前夜特寫</p>
<p>國際局面，又迴至世界大戰暴戾屠戮之前夕，火藥的氣味，巳充滿了全世界人們的嗅覺器官，戰爭之不能倖免，為誰不敢否認的事情，帝國主義個個都在那兒摩拳擦掌，鈎心鬥角，力求軍備之擴張，殺人的武器，日夜不斷地精益求精，以期達到迅速殲滅敵人，和得到最後勝利之迷夢。</p>
<p>未來的戰爭，是由平面戰爭而轉變為立體戰爭，戰爭的利器，已由弓矢巡洋艦等等，砲彈所到之處，地崩物裂，飛機襲擊之境，血肉橫飛，其慘酷悲痛，已戚到不忍聞不忍覩之餘地，更有所恐怖者，帝國主義之野心勃勃，國無公理，一切殺人工具之銳利和猛烈，誠使人瞠目咋舌談虎色變，因此兇暴不仁慘無人道之毒氣戰和細菌戰之施用，相繼踵起，威震世界，在彈指之間，可以屍伏遍野，田禾盡决，殺人威力之酷戾，誠使人不寒而懍，觸目驚心，細菌戰與毒氣戰在未來大戰上旣如此重要，現在我們來看一看細菌戰爭吧。</p>
<p>細菌戰爭雖然殘暴不仁，但在過去戰爭中，並未實施用過，它最初的實騐，是在第一次世界大戰之末期，那時德軍在布加萊斯特德國公館內培養一種鼻疽菌，想使用於羅馬尼亞騎兵身上。另外又在瑞士沮利希地方總領事內培餐霍亂菌，想撒布俄國境內，但還沒有施用，俄國沙皇軍隊已崩潰瓦解，總領事想將其投入河中，以湮滅證據、但給司關密吿而被發覺，這就是轟動世界的沮希城細菌炸彈事伴，也就是展開細菌戰爭歷史的先聲。</p>
<p>細菌為疾病之源泉，是人類之仇敵，但戰爭上所應用之細菌，大都是法定之傳染病，或不易毀滅之芽胞菌，及各種化膿菌，例如霍亂，傷寒，鼠疫，百日咳，感冒，赤痢，破傷風，丹毒，結核病，斑疹傷寒，回歸熱，馬鼻疽菌，連鎖菌，狂犬病及各種化膿病之原菌等。</p>
<p>我們要硏究細菌戰爭，基本的着手必得先知各種細菌之形態，生活之性質及繁殖如何，與培養的方法，一方面可以製造細菌戰爭上的利器，以殲滅敵方，捍衛國家的領士，實現世界和平，一方面敵人用細菌攻擊於我，我們也就可以如何防禦，如何撲滅細菌為害，使細菌戰爭不能逞威於我國境內。</p>
<p>細菌戰的實施，並不是一件很容易的事，必定要有適合的氣壓，溫度，濕度，細菌方能在空氣中，食物內，土地與水內的良好境遇之下，方可以發揮它的猛威，展開它的暴戾，在實騐霍亂病傳業時，如遇有良好的境遇，其死亡率能達百分之六十，就是說一百人當中患了霍亂病，有六十人被霍亂菌斷送了生命的。</p>
<p>現在各國所預想的細菌戰爭上，所攻擊的方法列下：</p>
<p>（一）污染於飲水中，如將傷寒菌，霍亂菌，赤痢菌，結核菌，大腸桿菌等，拋棄於飲水中，水是否人一日不可少的東西，身體組織上有百分之六十為水構成，水與人類關係旣如此密切，若是水內含有病菌的話，其傳染疾病多接近，人們生命大有「朝不保暮」之勢其死亡的數字，有驚人的可怕。</p>
<p>（二）用鼠類及其他動物昆蟲，例如培養蚤虱，臭蟲，向敵方散佈病菌，驅逐瘋犬，咬囓人們，那鼠疫，斑疹傷寒，狂犬病等，將不斷發生了。</p>
<p>（三）塗抹破傷風菌，丹毒菌，連鎖菌與各種化膿菌於兵器上，或裝滿於子彈內，射擊至敵方。</p>
<p>（四）將培養繁殖之病菌，收藏子容積器皿內，由飛機上撒落下，在空氣屋裏，飲水內，充滿了感冒菌，百日咳，桔核病菌。</p>
<p>（五）將馬鼻疽，破傷風，惡性水腫菌，埋藏於泥士內，吾入一旦接觸之，遂罹此病矣。</p>
<p>我們從細菌戰爭實施攻擊的方法上，就可知道在空氣中，土地裏，飲水內，以及食物內……等等，都是能做細菌戰爭上重要的媒介，人們在時間上空閒上，一刻一分就能感染瘟疫的可能，喪失了生命，傳染病一旦發生，流行速率很快，死亡人數足可驚人，由一人，一家，一村，一鄕，一城，甚或至一省，傳播到全國，例如東三省傳播鼠疫，在數小時內，死亡達十萬人之多，民國二十年南方流行霍亂，數月內死亡之人數有幾十萬人，這種高超的死亡，是多驚懼啊—細菌果一旦用於細菌戰爭實踐起來，疫癘威力，殘殺慘狀，不但一個國家受其殘害，更可以傳播全世界，全世界發生瘟疫，眞是人類滅跡的一日，地球消滅的一天降臨，故可以說細菌戰之可怕，就勝於毒瓦斯之兇猛；因為毒氣施用時間不能持久，破壞能力也就比較有限制的，毒氣中毒作用各有不同，某一種毒氣有某一種危害，而沒有他種危害，例如芥子毒氣僅有糜爛皮膚之害，催淚性毒氣僅能使人淌眼淚，並且在它的區域內方能受其害，决不會傳播到很遠的地方去，所以細菌戰爭之可憎可畏，就此而知，我們對於細菌戰，那就應該急需的研究了。</p>
<h3>浙江硤石衛生狀况調查報告（五）</h3>
<p>— 沈松年</p>
<p>（二）民衆敎育程度</p>
<p>硤區為全縣中心，識字者較多，唯對衛牛常識仍頗缺乏，每遇疫癘的盛行，打醮便成為民衆們以為唯一的疫癘預防方法了，甚至求籤部卜，求仙方，其不幸死於其間，毫不歸咎於悮死，反諉之以天命，而對科學防疫的設施與方法除當局與少數醫藥界外，簡直無共他人士挺身出來，努力倡導，衛生敎育所以不易普及，由此可見。然則我們身為知識階級而又是醫界一分子，更如何努力奮起力促其普及才對呵！</p>
<p>（三）民衆夜校</p>
<p>除民敎館附設外其他各校早已停辦，主因自然是限於經費，民敎館所附設之夜校，成績尙佳，惜未能普遍得民衆信仰。—那當然是民智低落關係。</p>
<p>（四）報紙與醫刋</p>
<p>這裏的地方報有三種；一為硤石商報，資格最老，為縣黨部常委吳雨耕氏所主辦，內容注重商情，故頗得常地商界歡迎，附於本報發行之醫刊有二，一為硤石新醫研究社夏蒼霖等所主編的「現代醫藥一；一為硤石醫事改進社，沈松年等所主編的「醫學動向」，該社以團結醫藥界同志改進硤石醫事為民衆謀健康幸福為主旨，其使命如下：</p>
<p>（一）到民問去</p>
<p>我們要實際的深入民間，一切務求民衆化，以促進民衆健康幸福為出發點；而歸納到復興民族的康莊大道上。</p>
<p>（二）提高醫德</p>
<p>古代醫界甘願列入三敎九流之中，行醫江湖化，致醫德淪亡！我們要促起醫界自覺尊重人格，俾國德高掦。</p>
<p>（三）研討學術</p>
<p>學術為天下之公物，其本身根本無界域之分，派別之見，只要適存於中國現代的，都值得我們來研討，必冀進展上二社所出版之醫刋，均為定期刊物，頗得當地人士所推崇，戚認為衛敎之先聲，有功民衆。唯文盲究屬難以灌瑜，故成效極微。</p>
<p>「硤石報」醫刋僅夏蒼霖所主編的「醫藥與民衆」，創刋未久。其餘為硤石晨報，篇幅最小，僅四開，無翳刊，故無緒述之必要。</p>
<p>（五）衛敎之幼稚</p>
<p>這裏教育程度較偏僻處，雖尙稱普及，在此過渡朝代，讀書救國運動雖已高聳入雲，究因　我國文化低落，文盲佔絕對多數，故衛教在這裏同樣也是十分糟糕！此實為硤石衛生設施所以難期實現的最大癥結。</p>
<p>（丙）有關醫德</p>
<p>（一）互相傾軋</p>
<p>這裏的醫界，在新醫方面的有德日英美等派，究因曾受過相當敎育，故均互相聯絡，絕少有派別之私見發生，唯非正式之冒牌科學醫，却自私自利隨時在搗蛋，實科學醫不易普遍發展的最大致命傷！在舊醫方面，則時有互相傾軋的事端發生，以破壞同道名譽為能事，專在人家背後截包，不道德行為完全暴露無遺，實為行將沒落之預兆；其中當然也有例外，唯眞正為遵守醫德者絕少</p>
<p>（二）不肯負責</p>
<p>醫界不肯負責，此實為醫界之通病，自然也有例外，民衆生命安全旣沒得到相當保障，實非國家民族之幸。因醫界不肯負責任，可唯利是圖，名利兼收，然而已失了醫為仁術之本旨。</p>
<p>（三）不隨請隨到</p>
<p>有些醫者，每喜應人之招請無故遲延，其診務雖門可羅雀，亦要擺些臭架子，直延至數小時以上方才出門，以為足可抬高身份。要知道人之病情，瞬息萬變，豈可遷延時刻，貽誤大事？「爾雖不殺伯仁，伯仁却由你而死，」於心何忍，醫德安在？</p>
<p>（四）拜金主義</p>
<p>金錢萬能，同時也是萬惡，因失了入性的醫者，皆以金錢為目的，視入命如兒戲，對於貧家招請，每因酬金較薄，或竟拒不應招，或招不卽來，致人之身命，因此斷送，無形殺人，其罪甚大。這些醫者已障落了慈善性質最高尙的自由醫業的尊嚴。</p>
<p>（五）行醫江湖化</p>
<p>醫業原屬最高尙的尊貴慈善性質職業，行翳目標自然應以普濟衆生謀大衆健康幸福為出發點；而歸納到復興民族的康莊大道上，絕對不應流入江湖化，以欺矇病家，達歛錢為目的，貽誤民衆，如其如此，共人格卽已墮落，與禽獸無異？</p>
<p>（丁）有關醫法</p>
<p>（一）無法醫士之專設</p>
<p>法醫士原為正式醫師謀保障，康醫之當頭棒喝，關於醫藥上過失或病家之誤會，站在醫學的立塲上，依據法律，判斷絲毫無誤，那末才能談得到公允。可是硤石無法醫士之設，萬一醫藥上發生糾紛，就弊竇百出，也許沒有錯誤的醫者寃枉被累，而庸醫反得倖免，實非民衆之福，抑且社會國家之幸！</p>
<p>（二）醫藥界無法律常識</p>
<p>法律原為維持人類共同牛活，而共負促進大衆福利的範疇，故應為大衆所格守，醫藥界直接有關民衆生命安全，間接有關國家盛衰，故更應嚴守法律才對。可是往往許多醫者藥家不知法律常識，而誤觸法網者不知凡幾，此　非醫藥界之幸！</p>

<h3>述李克加及李克加病（四）</h3>
<p>— 陳端白</p>
<p>血管內被細胞內李克加的生長增殖，在發疹傷寒過程中，是一件容易證明的事實，反之在恙蟲病過程中，却不易證明，在其它細胞或組織內，李克加的存在，因為染色的困難，還無可以確切判定的把振，在血液塗抹標本，及組織切片標本中，李克加雖可覓得但手績不易，依着個人的經騐，卽使試騐動物的皮膚丘疹的，或睪丸塗抹本，假使是在取出材料後，隔一二小時製就的，也難於染色，而被覓獲，可見李克加在細胞外的生存能力，至為薄弱，患者血液中不能檢出的緣由，對此或亦並無關係。</p>
<p>（六）傳染方式及免疫學方面</p>
<p>各種李克加病的展轉傳染，均非直接人與人的傳接，却是由一個中問人來做這項工作的媒介者，每種李克加病各有他的專門媒介者，茲列舉如下。</p>
<p>（一）發疹傷寒的媒介物（傳播者）是衣蝨Pediculus　Vestimenti</p>
<p>（二）恙蟲病的媒介物　恙虫（赤虫）Trombicula　Akamushi</p>
<p>（三）落磯山紅斑熱的媒介物牛蝨Permacemtor　Venustus</p>
<p>（四）塹壕熱　蝨類未定Lausenart</p>
<p>除了媒介人卽傳播者以外，常然還有一個病原體的長期儲藏家，卽所謂Vlrustregr這一齣戲的劇中人，非人類中患者與曾患者，卽為獸物，例如恙蟲病中之野鼠，Microsus　Montebelli傳播的方式，是由被感染的卽身藏在活動與增與殖期內李克加的蝨類，吮吸人類血液時，刺入皮膚，因為李克加在蝨類佈中恒生殖於消化管的，腸或胃的上皮細胞內，經無限度的生殖，細胞體內容積過量，不能再容時，也會破裂，這些李克加就跟着消化液的外洩流入傷口，在這個地方，就發生初期近疹，逐漸由局部壞死，而有時變成潰瘍，再由此而蔓延及於身體，其他各部，這時候所取的途徑，根據病理解部的事實，當然仍舊是治着血管外壁走的，致病的原因，除了病理的組織情形所引起外，主要點初在毒素的產生，這是毫無疑問的，經過了一次李克加的光到以後，可以獲得所謂免疫能力，換句話說，第二次不會再發生，可是這個危疫力，並不是絕對的，有時也有第二次被染的可能，祇不過經而易痊罷了，抗毒素的存在，雖至今尙未能直接證明，但是皮膚過敏反應，會由萬特門及勃洛第Goodmann　&amp;　Kroide在紐的紐的大學醫科細菌學院內工作報吿中，於發疹傷寒之旣患者中，證實開於恙蟲病之皮膚過敏反應，筆者於（一九三五）去年在東京傳染病研究所滯在中也曾在危疫動物身上，獲得成功，覆試也有同樣的結果，現在正在應試於旣患的恙蟲病病者，姑不問他結果何如，但就筆者試騐的臨床，病理方面事實來推測，則免疫性的（抗毒素）存在，毫無疑問，Antikorper　Immuitat</p>
<p>（七）臨床症状</p>
<p>（各種李克加病微有互異，茲姑舉發疹傷寒一種以明之）</p>
<p>發疹傷寒潛伏期，大的為四至十四日，鮮有逾二星期者，初起時卽現高熱，普通達三十九至四十度以上，晨間稍低，各是壯熱的經二星期至第十四或十五日而突然落，斑疹產生的時期，大的為發病後的第四至第六日，初為不整形的針頭大小的細點，表面高出於皮膚，觸之根有刺感，按之則紅色能消失，但經二三日後，則在疹漸顯，紅色日深，中間呈深紅暗色形，成出血性之斑點，二星期後，始自行消失，而代以色斑，病愈時也逐漸自行退去，斑點最初發生地，地點為腹部，胸部，肩部，漸延及於全身，面部及頸部則為例外，白感症狀為劇烈之頭痛，腰痛，噁性，及極度之疲毛，結膜炎也是早就發生的病象，所以病非常畏光，面部皮膚全部紅旺，神志不髯，睡眠失常，每苦不能合眼。</p>
<h3>疾病常識問答</h3>
<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（九十四）慢性胃黏膜炎</p>
<p>（問）慢性胃黏膜炎，是怎樣起的？</p>
<p>（答）這種病的起因，或續發於急性胃黏膜炎，或和急性胃黏膜炎一樣因飲食不愼而起。又有因飲酒吸烟過度而發。</p>
<p>（問）在身體患那幾種病時，要併發這種病嗎？</p>
<p>（答）患肝硬變症，腎病，梅毒，癆病，貧血，心臟病，呼吸器病，胃癌，胃擴張等時侯，大都併發慢性胃黏膜炎。</p>
<p>（問）慢性胃黏膜炎的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）和急性的大略相同。可是病狀不像他那麽急激。病人有食慾缺乏，胃部膨滿，胃部壓感，噯氣，嘈囃，　被厚苔等病狀。</p>
<p>（問）他覺的有什麽病狀？</p>
<p>（答）用手壓病人的胃部，覺得膨滿，有壓痛，有振水音。</p>
<p>（問）患這種病的病人，自覺怎樣不舒服？</p>
<p>（答）病人自覺頭部壓重，頭痛，不眠症，工作能力减退，精神變調，胃性眩暈等。而全身營養狀態，當然受障碍。</p>
<p>（問）胃分泌有沒有異常？</p>
<p>（答）胃液內遊離鹽酸缺乏而黏液分泌則增加。</p>
<p>（問）怎樣診斷慢性胃黏膜炎？</p>
<p>（答）憑上述各項症候，不難診斷；可是應當和胃癌，胃神經症，胃液缺乏等相區別。</p>
<p>（問）這種病的治療，應當注重那一點？</p>
<p>（答）慢性胃黏膜炎的治療，第一要査出他的原因而除去他。這是最應注重的一點。</p>
<p>（問）病人的食品，應當怎樣注意？</p>
<p>（答）病人的食品，務須避免油類脂膩食品限制菜疏食品，多吃米，粉，糖類，忌飲酒，香料，水分。</p>
<p>（問）對於慢性胃黏膜炎的治療，用什麼藥品？</p>
<p>（答）治療這種病的藥品，不外酸性劑，苦味劑，鹼性劑和消化酵素制酵劑等。</p>
<p>（問）酸性劑是怎樣用的？</p>
<p>（答）酸性劑，普通採用稀鹽酸，同時消化酵素的胃液素相併用的，像Aodiol　Pepsin就是一種已經合就的製劑。</p>
<p>（問）苦味劑，有那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）苦味劑種類很多，像Cendurango製劑，龍胆，苦味酊，規那酊，番木鼇酊Columbo根煎等都是。其作用都在促進胃的運動和分泌。</p>
<p>（問）鹼性劑，用那幾種？</p>
<p>（答）鹼性劑最普通的是重炭酸鈉，煆製鎂，鑛泉，鈣鉍鎂合劑Cal-Bis　Mo過氧化鎂等。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>撲朔迷離的歐洲政局</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前日比王宣布中立，歐洲局勢，為之大變，紐的民聲講壇報謂，歐洲集體安全制度，原已夭殤，此次比王宜布中立，不啻又饗以最後之一彈，確眞，比王此舉事前毫不與英法商酌，突然宣布此項演說，宜英法兩國驚疑不置也。法比兩國，原有唇齒相依之勢，法此合作，尙難遏制野心勃勃之德國，故法比聯盟，久為法國國防準備之重要因素，今因比國之舉動，而須將瑪奇諾特防綫，由比國邊界展至海濱，是法國又加重了一層防禦工作，歐洲局勢，因之發生動搖，此固必然之勢也。</p>
<p>並且此决此王宣布中立，自表面觀之，是法國少一帮手，萬一比王改變國策，名為中立，而實袒德，則法國非但少一帮手，更是多一敵人，則歐局更是不堪設想，所以英法格外驚疑，而德意表示欣喜，英法二國不能不質間比王宣布中立的眞正意義，此無怪英法兩國對於此舉，極深關切也，嗣據歐訊傳來，比王並無傾向德國之意，其用意無非欲解脫戰爭之漩渦，免受飛機大砲之蹂躪而已，則比王袒德之嫌，似可稍釋。</p>
<p>比之處歐，猶春秋之鄭國，處淤兩大之間，時受戰爭之阨運，歐戰之役，痛定思痛，猶為寒心，現在德國重整軍備，大有報仇雪恥之决心，而意德法西主義者，又復互相聯絡，德奧之間，亦表親善，是已回復大戰前之狀態，萬一重起戰端，非但比國不堪設想，卽全歐慘遭糜爛矣，而英法諸國，態度又極軟化，若德國仍照希利芬將軍，在歐戰前所定計劃，（卽假道比國）進攻法國，則比國不免首當其衝，而先罹慘禍，</p>
<p>卽使德國並無進攻法國之意，而最近法俄協定成功，萬一俄德開釁，則比國亦不免為兩國之戰塲，是以此王此次宣布嚴守中立，其原因卽在於此，其實比國為地勢上的關係，歐洲不發生戰事則已，萬一發生戰事，比國欲嚴守中立，非特勢有所未能，而力亦有所不逮，蓋能守之國家，而不懼人之侵略者，則必助人戰鬥之力亦鉅，所謂有舉足輕重之勢者也，故比國之力量如何？尙不免有所疑問矣？</p>
<p>故此次比王宣布中立，英法大驚，而德意大快，但天下事，無獨有偶，德奧妥協，早已成功，三國（德奧意）一體之局，似吿大定，不料昨見報載，奧總理許希尼格搏士亦發表宣言，謂保持國家獨立，內政抉非他國所得干預，政體問題，由人民公决，對德奧協定，表示觖望，此種宣言，不啻對於德國法西主義者，亦擲一炸彈，故比奧兩國之宣布中立，可謂相抵，又復相消，此事當亦為英法所樂聞，而為德意所驚疑者也。</p>
<h3>鐵匠老六</h3>
<p>— 林吉</p>
<p>充滿了屈辱的鐵匠老六底一生是過得多麼快呀——恰如一枝離弦的箭，射出去祗一剎那的時光，他已經是五十多歲的人了。</p>
<p>瘦得像一隻猴，背不知道從什麽時候起就駝了下來，永遠睜著那對尖眼睛，老六底模樣是很能令人憐憫的。年紀那么老了，還得整天地打鐵，用那乾柴一樣的手臂，擎起鐵錘一記一記地打在燒紅了的鐵片上。熔爐底火熊態地燃燒着，正靠在老六底旁邊，於是不一會老六便淌出汗水來了，滴落在黑滯的地板上如小雨點一般。狹窄而陰暗的鐵舖裏，空氣是渾濁得可怕的；在這樣的空氣中呼吸了二十多年的老六，現在是患着很重的癆症，時時咳嗽着。吐痰成了他一種很不好的習慣；他老是這裏一堆，那裏一堆地吐着，衛生不是老六這種人所能顧及的，要吐痰就吐它一口，在他算得什麼呢！每天帮助老六工作的是兩個學徒；那小的一個蹲在一角拉着風箱，滿臉黑灰，是一個剛從鄉下跑出來沒有多少時侯的孩子。另一個就用鉗子把燒紅了的鐵塊挾了出來，和老六一同地打着—舖子里終日響着「的達…的達」的聲音。</p>
<p>現在，老六是孤伶伶地，沒有妻兒子女，也沒有親戚了，眞是多麽悽凉的晚景哪。有人問起他的時候，他也總是低下頭，像有什麼傷心事似地，默默含淚走了開去。他好像對於生並不威到興奮；但是死於他却總有點不願意—能够這麼有天生命就過一天，老六就够滿足了。</p>
<p>我是自小就知道老六這個人和他底打鐵舖的：後來離開了家鄕，一年又復一年，記憶是淡漠得連老六底面目也想不起來了。這一次回到家鄉，一切都改變了的家鄕，在不勝感慨之餘，有一次偶然走過老六那裏和他招呼了一下，他就出乎意料之外地把我留下了。</p>
<p>那是夏天將要逝去的晚上，天氣仍然很熱，老六正在那門口乘凉。他呌那個小學徒把一張竹椅抬出來，特地用布楷去了上面的灰塵，慇懃地招待我坐下。從來不曾見過鐵匠老六那麽高興地招呼過我，微微有點奇怪然而過了一回我就明白了，老六許多年來的生話實在太孤獨，太枯澀了，連一個可以說話的人也沒有。眞的，這一個晚上他問了我許多的話，關於外邊的，我都詳細地回答了他。老六年靑的時候是曾經到外邊的城市漂流過來的，只是現在的情形變得太利害了。在這古老平靜的鄕間他株守了二十多年，看着年靑的一輩又長大了起來，他底感槪眞是多麽深啊。</p>
<p>「要不是那一年鄕里打起仗來，我也還有一個家呢，」老六忽然提起自己底往事來了。「記得淸淸楚楚的，那一年我底兒子已經四歲了，剛剛學會了說話，聰明而且强壯……可是砲火起了；中國人自家爭奪地盤，打得很兇，連逃走也來不及，軍隊竄過了這鄉村，强姦了我底妻子，而那强壯的孩子也恐嚇過度而死去了！……這件事過了那麽多的年數，我都一點也沒有忘記！」說到這裏，他那尖眼角上流出淚珠來了，還仰起頭深深地太息着。</p>
<p>鐵匠老六底一番慘刦是我以前所不知道的。自此以後他就不再有一個親近的人，而默默地負着生活底重擔，在入生底旅途上彳亍着。現在，老六是衰老了。</p>
<p>我不知道要怎樣才能安慰他，想到內戰摧毀了他底幸福，生活底皮鞭抽得他背也駝了下來，也不禁唏噓起來。</p>
<p>秋天來到時，我又離開了古老的家絕，漂泊到外邊來了。每一次思念到家鄕，就記起那一夜鐵匠老六和我的談話。想來他一定還是那麽默默地拿着鐵錘，打在燒紅了鐵塊上面，打發他底垂老的日子吧。</p>

<h3>秋夜</h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>沿江渡那邊走，我到了海灘。</p>
<p>月色正朦朧着，潮水已經退了，海灘就變得寬廣而且靜寂起來。這處城市的囂鬧，在灰白色的城牆那邊消隱了，這兒沒有人底聲息，也聽不到車馬的奔馳，和呌囂，有的只是陰冷和空虛。</p>
<p>我在沙難上踱着步，眼睛看着遙遠的村莊，在村莊里時常透來了柔弱的狗兒底嗥吠，靜聽海底呻吟；可是這都充塞不了我心底枯槁和空處。三天前我抱了滿肚子熟望到了這小城市，三天後的現在我賣光所有底東西，而且飢餓着。於是每晚到這海灘上來徘徊，成為我每天必經的生活課程。</p>
<p>輕輕地我從這邊踱向了那邊，再想從那邊踱向這邊，可是一種短促而奇異的聲息把我吸住了。我遲疑著站住，鎖住　　四周　　　　　　　　　　　　不到，有的只是岸邊夜風擊打在榕樹枝上的聲息，和海底呻吟。於是我又提起脚來想繼續無終止的徘徊，然而我沒有繼續了若干時間，在那死的寂靜中，我聽見了一陣幽咽聲，正從岸邊的一座破廟宇里透露過來的。我開始朝那邊走過去了。</p>
<p>這是一所坍舊的廟宇，宮亭已塌損下來了，在石埕上撤滿了破損的瓦片和灰土的殘餘，堆積着，成一個小小的山坵，蜈蚣草在上面生長着。廟里非常陰暗，充塞着霉臭和潮濕的氣息。我跨進了宮亭的石階，便兀然的站住，幽泣聲變得淸晰起來了，是由人們底喉嚨里，而且是由一個女人底喉嚨里發出來的。</p>
<p>我開始着注意了這廟宇里的每一個角落，在那一個作為善男信女禮拜的地方，我就發現了一團，細小的，灰白色的動物在蠕蠕的動着，好像一匹受了傷底獸發抖那麽地動着。於是我便輕聲的咳着，而且跨進去了。</p>
<p>現在，我就站在這蠕蠕動着的動物面前，可能地看淸楚了他底輪廓和每一個細小的抽動。她底帶着纖長頭髮的頭，被兩隻細小的，赤裸着的臂膀開抱着，全身也同樣地赤裸着作蜷縮形，她好像也聽見我進來的步履聲似的，便慢慢的從她底臂膊里抬起頭來，用圓大的眼睛，向我吃驚看着。由她那細小的面孔，我斷定了她是一個還不到成熟年齡的小姑娘。</p>
<p>她向我畏懼地看若，忽然揚起來，大聲的呌道：</p>
<p>「滾開！你這不要臉的流氓！」低住頭又嗚嗚咽咽的哭起來。</p>
<p>這使我這麽大的吃驚了起來，而至於連忙往後移退幾步。但她沒有使我驚　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　起勇氣，跑上去。</p>
<p>你已把我蹂躪着而且搶去了一切東西了，還不心滿嗎？她哭了一會，好像也覺得有點異樣似的，又抬起頭來，用憤怒而愁慘的聲調呌着。</p>
<p>「我不明白你底話的意思。」我也低聲的嚅囁着回答。</p>
<p>她顯然有點吃驚了，因為在黑暗中我看見她底眼睛睜得超出常態的大。</p>
<p>「你是什麽人？」她疑惑地問。</p>
<p>「我？」我冷淡的回答「一個失業漢和流浪者。……</p>
<p>「那麽你來這兒做什麽，沒有和他們在一起？……」</p>
<p>「你說什麼，我一句也不明白。」我搖着頭。</p>
<p>「也許你不是和他們一道的。」她像對自己似的喃喃着「剛剛有兩個大漢在這兒把我××了，臨走時他們又剝去了我身上的衣服。……</p>
<p>「你是什麽人？你說人家把你××。……」</p>
<p>「我？」她冷笑着「一個賣淫女……」又低低的接下「晚上我在一家茶樓里替幾個客人唱曲子，有兩個大漢呌我跟他們上旅館去，我就跟他們走，可是他們沒有上旅館去，把我騙到這兒來。……」</p>
<p>「現在他們呢！」</p>
<p>「沒有給過我錢，反把衣服搶着跑了。」她底聲調變成哽咽的了。「現在我什麽也沒有，全身光赤着，怎好回去。……」她傷心的哭了。</p>
<p>我呆呆的站着，有一種悲愴的戚覺刺痛了我，於是把自己背在背上僅有用來替換的衣服解下，遞給她：</p>
<p>「拿去吧，這是我最後的一套衣服了。</p>
<p>說罷，我就默默的踱出來，迎着朦</p>

<h3>散（續）</h3>
<p>— 沈深</p>
<p>大家有同一的信心，我們的路綫是正確的，前途是光明的。</p>
<p>誰也不出聲，誰也不敢想。祇默然地低着頭走着，脚的步子是整齊的。嚓，察—嚓，嚓—嚓，嚓……</p>
<p>這是多可怕的一個沈默呀—心里存一個萬一的希望：大家唱個歌。</p>
<p>大家可沒唱。可是——</p>
<p>哇——一羣老鴉起來了。心里有點悶，駡一聲連自己也聽不出的什麽，好似嘴唇是抖了一下。</p>
<p>晴天一個霹靂，老瞿的嘴抖了一下：</p>
<p>「離鳳凰府城祗六十里——里哪……」</p>
<p>啊——天哪—這就是我們的鄉導老瞿嗎？</p>
<p>大家呆了一呆。六十里！似乎耳朶沒有聽錯。</p>
<p>步子是嚓——嚓——嚓…慢了下來。而且後來——</p>
<p>誰也沒發一聲口令，可是全停下了，坐下了。</p>
<p>天，不知是幾是黑了下來的。有幾顆星星在映着細眼睛，活像鬼子的，媽的！</p>
<p>月亮圓圓地嵌在灰靑色的天空，頂在我們的頭上。輕霜似的月光洒在長有高梁的大地，生滿樹木的山崗，也洒在我們這一羣亡命之徒的臉上。是那末公平，那末和柔。</p>
<p>可愛的月亮呀！</p>
<p>三　沉默着。然而沈默是幹不了什麽事的，我們要幹下去，我們要括下去，依照着我們的約定。</p>
<p>我們的約定：我們約定在離府城六十里的地方散夥。我們走上了絕地，得不到接濟，四周都有大隊的鬼子兵駐紥。自己的力量大小，子彈缺乏得可憐。現在什麽法子都沒有，祇有留下十一個堅硬的漢子，別的重大的使命還要我們幹呢！現在——</p>
<p>給五個兄弟和別隊的兄弟們做了最後一次哀悼，然後我們十一個……</p>
<p>走！走啦。眼淚在流着，沙啞的喉嘴呌着。</p>
<p>「再會吧，兄弟們！各自保重。總有一天，我們仍會碰到的」！</p>
<p>眼淚糊滿眼睛，老李，高個子！……一個個在面前幌着，點點頭。</p>
<p>心痛着。終於我離開了他們，他們也離開了我。獨自兒踏上輕霜的明月的道路。</p>
<p>一陣陣撲過來的，是關外特有的淸凉的高梁的芬芳呀！</p>

        <h1>1936.10.20</h1>
<h3>Zhang Qun and Kawagoe Held Fourth Meeting Yesterday: Continuing Negotiations on Sino-Japanese Diplomacy, Differences Still Difficult to Reconcile, Japanese Ambassador Has Requested Instructions from His Government, Negotiations Will Continue in the Short Term</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3 PM on the 19th, Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe visited Foreign Minister Zhang at his official residence, holding talks for over three hours. He departed at 6:30 PM. It is reported that the two sides exchanged opinions on Sino-Japanese negotiations, but their views did not align. They agreed to continue discussions again soon, but the date has not yet been determined. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Ambassador Kawagoe returned to his residence from his meeting with Foreign Minister Zhang, he summoned Consul General Suma, Secretaries Tajiri and Matsuura, and Military Attachés Amemiya and Nakahara of the Army and Navy to report on the content of the meeting and discuss future strategies. As some issues remained unresolved in today's meeting, there is still hope for considerable progress in future negotiations. Therefore, it has been decided to continue negotiations with Foreign Minister Zhang. A concrete proposal based on today's negotiations has been drafted and urgently submitted to the government for instructions. The next negotiation is expected to take place sooner, around the 21st. (19th Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese Naval Attaché Saburo Nakahara returned to Nanjing on the 19th via China Aviation Corporation aircraft to call on Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe and report on everything. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) It is reported that the scope of the meeting between Zhang Qun and Kawagoe on the 19th included general negotiation issues, with a detailed exchange of opinions. Both sides stated their wishes based on their own positions and views. The next meeting is scheduled to take place within this week. Those who participated in the talks on the 19th were Shimizu and Suma from the Japanese side, and Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department, from the Chinese side. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the fourth meeting between Ambassador Kawagoe and Foreign Minister Zhang, the following statement was issued: "Ambassador Kawagoe met with Foreign Minister Zhang at 3 PM on the 19th to discuss Sino-Japanese issues. As opinions have not yet been reconciled, another meeting will be held soon to continue discussions." (19th Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Zhang departed from Shanghai by train at 7 AM on the 19th and arrived in Nanjing. After resting briefly at the Ministry's official residence, he went to the Ministry to handle official business. He scheduled a fourth meeting with Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe at 4 PM to continue exchanging views on adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. (19th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Japanese Foreign Ministry has sent new instructions to Ambassador Kawagoe regarding the fourth meeting between Foreign Minister Zhang and Ambassador Kawagoe, providing clear instructions on the content of the negotiations. Currently, there are still two major issues that are most difficult to resolve: (1) the special status of North China, and (2) joint anti-communism. Even if the scope of the negotiations is considerably reduced and the nature of the negotiations is significantly limited, it remains very clear that there is no sign of a compromise being reached. Therefore, the future of the negotiations is bound to be tortuous. The atmosphere here indicates that Japan's policy of resolving the issue through diplomatic channels has not wavered. A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry acknowledged that the British and French Ambassadors to China and Ambassador Kawagoe did indeed hold talks in Nanjing, but no proposals were made. (19th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Nichinichi Shimbun, Foreign Minister Arita has sent new important instructions to Ambassador Kawagoe, urging him to conduct negotiations with the Chinese government in the spirit of reciprocity. However, Japan's predetermined policies must be achieved. The newspaper expects that concrete proposals regarding the special treatment of North China and the conclusion of a joint anti-communist agreement will be presented by Ambassador Kawagoe in Nanjing this afternoon. (19th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador Kawagoe has decided to go to the Foreign Ministry in Nanjing at 3 PM today to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang for the fourth round of Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations. It is reported that there seems to be a change in the Japanese negotiating strategy, with Hirota and Arita intending to resolve everything separately. It is expected that Sino-Japanese diplomacy will have a new turning point after this meeting. (19th Hualian News Agency)</p>
<h3>Fu Zuoyi Telegraphed to Peiping, Stating that the Defense of Eastern Suiyuan is Consolidated, Prince Sha Summoned Suiyuan-Mongolian Council Staff for Instructions, Declaring the Central Government's Benevolence Towards the Mongolian Banners</h3>
<p>(Peiping) It is reported that Fu Zuoyi telegraphed to Peiping, stating that although the situation in eastern Suiyuan is tense, our defenses are solid and there is no concern for security. Liu Ruming is scheduled to depart from Zhangjiakou within days to inspect various locations. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Prince De returned to Pangjiang Wangfu from Jiabusi Temple on the 13th due to his mother's illness. Affairs at Jiabusi Temple are being handled by Chief Secretary Jiergelang. Affairs in Bailingmiao are being handled by Prince Guo. Zhuoshihai is currently in Zhangbei. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military news: Two detachments of bandits from Li and Wang, totaling 20,000, incited by a certain party, are harassing Shangdu and other locations, and advancing towards various banners in eastern Suiyuan. There have been four or five minor skirmishes in the past two or three days, with no changes in the defense lines. The situation is quite serious, and a larger battle is expected to occur within days. It is reported that Chairman has ordered interception, and it will be cleared soon. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Prince Sha summoned all staff members of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Council for instructions on the afternoon of the 19th, extensively extolling the central government's benevolence towards the Mongolian banners. Shi Huayan delivered instructions on behalf of Ge Xishan, urging all members to start with unity and strive to serve the country. Prince Sha is scheduled to return to the banner on the morning of the 20th and proceed to Suludeng to convene the Ikh Juu League winter defense conference. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain official of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the situation in eastern Suiyuan is indeed perilous. However, rumors circulating outside that Prince De is being manipulated by a certain party and leaning towards Manchukuo are unreliable. According to letters and telegrams received by the commission from Prince De on the 19th regarding the handling of Mongolian affairs, ten people from the Mongolian banners have been selected as national representatives. It seems that Prince De's attitude is ambiguous and cannot be fully trusted. In addition, rumors circulating that the Mongolian Political Council in Bailingmiao is relocating have been addressed by telegrams received by the commission from Bailingmiao. To facilitate Prince De's work, only a portion of the staff will relocate to Prince De's residence to work, while the remaining personnel will remain in Bailingmiao. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhangjiakou) A portion of Wang Ying's bandit troops, currently located south of Ulanhada in Shangdu, engaged in skirmishes with Zhao Chengshou's troops of the Jin-Sui garrison, with the aim of testing the strength of the garrison. However, they are also actively digging trenches and other defensive fortifications, seemingly intending to hold out for a long time. Wang's troops also frequently go to Taolin, a county under Suiyuan jurisdiction, to plunder food and horses. They also plunder in Shangdu, especially at night, causing resentment and fear among the people. Li Shouxin is currently recruiting a large number of seamstresses to rush-make camp tents in Zhangbei. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) The vanguard of Wang Ying's bandit troops, consisting of over 3,000 people, is planning to attack Suiyuan and is ready in the Shangdu area.

The authorities of various provinces in North China have expressed that everything will be based on Chairman Jiang's intentions, absolutely obeying the central government, and enthusiastically supporting it.

<h3>Zhejiang Joint Memorial Week, President Jiang Attends and Delivers Instructions, Civil Servants and Others Should Set an Example, People Should Not Harbor Bandit Sympathies</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Zhejiang Provincial Party and Government held a joint memorial week at 8 AM this morning in the auditorium of the Provincial Party Headquarters, inviting President Jiang to deliver instructions. More than 800 staff members from various agencies attended. Jiang arrived on time and was accompanied by Wang Tingyang, Huang Shaohong, etc. After leading the ceremony, Chairman Jiang delivered an impromptu speech, mainly focusing on two points: (1) Heads of agencies, civil servants, teachers, and students of various schools should set an example and be a role model for the people. (2) The failure to eliminate the banditry in Zhejiang Province is considered the greatest shame. From now on, attention should be paid to the talents of county magistrates, organizing and training the masses, and arming self-defense. The people should not harbor the psychology of fearing bandits. It lasted an hour before it ended. Jiang then met with members of the provincial party and government in the rest room, inquiring about the local situation. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Chairman Jiang attended the enlarged memorial week of the provincial government in Hangzhou on the morning of the 19th and delivered instructions. The main points of the instructions were: Firstly, he talked about his views on Hangzhou, saying that according to what Zhongzheng has observed during his week in Hangzhou, Hangzhou and Zhejiang Province have made significant progress in the past year due to the joint efforts of our party, government, military, and academic colleagues. Colleagues from all walks of life, especially the general youth students, have changed their past lifeless state and showed a lively and dynamic spirit in all aspects of their lives, actions, demeanor, and work, gradually presenting a vigorous phenomenon. This shift in the atmosphere is commendable, but the current progress is mostly superficial and formal, which is not enough. I hope that everyone can continue to work hard and make progress, so that colleagues from all walks of life, all young students, and all the people can eliminate all bad habits such as weakness, timidity, laziness, etc., and develop the inner spirit of self-confidence and self-improvement, enrich the natural ability of self-defense and self-reliance, and then cultivate a strong and robust new atmosphere. Secondly, he mentioned that there are still scattered bandits in the border counties of Zhejiang Province that have not been completely eliminated, which is a shame for the responsible comrades in all circles of the province. In the future, the agencies and troops directly responsible for the elimination of bandits should make special efforts to fulfill their responsibilities, and the competent authorities in party affairs, government affairs, and education should also pay special attention to the work of organizing and training the people in the future, seeking to eradicate bandits and transform society. Especially for remote and poor counties, we must try our best to subsidize their expenses, and send the most outstanding and hard-working personnel to these counties to engage in basic work such as party affairs, government affairs, education, and economic construction. Finally, he mentioned the fundamental purpose of revolutionary nation-building, which is what the university calls "clarifying virtue, loving the people, and reaching the highest good." The way to make efforts and the method of governing are most succinctly expressed in the chapter "Duke Ai Asked about Politics" in the Doctrine of the Mean. The fundamental purpose of that chapter is firstly to clarify the truth that "governance lies in people" and to conclude with self-cultivation, that is, the importance of what the university calls "clarifying virtue." Secondly, it explains that "knowing difficulty and striving to act" can enable the inferior to ascend to the superior, thus indicating the basic skills of self-cultivation, that is, what is called "loving learning is close to wisdom, striving to act is close to benevolence, and knowing shame is close to courage." I hope that comrades and compatriots from all walks of life will follow this essential path, unite and strive hard. Zhongzheng believes that Zhejiang Province will surely make rapid progress and will not be difficult to create a model of revolutionary nation-building in the shortest period of time, and fulfill the responsibilities of all comrades.

<h3>Li Sihao Visits Tadashi and Horiuchi, Exchanging Specific Opinions on Economic Cooperation in North China, Li Talks About the Hope That the Japanese Side Can Clearly Indicate a Scope</h3>
<p>(Tientsin) Li Sihao visited Tadashi at the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple at 2 PM on the 19th. He was introduced to senior staff members of the military headquarters, Hashimoto, Iida, Kazuchi, Senda, Adachi, Asai, etc., and exchanged opinions on economic cooperation in North China for nearly two hours. The talks between the two sides were very harmonious. Li, due to not knowing Japanese, accompanied Chen Juesheng as an interpreter. He left at about 5 o'clock. He contacted Horiuchi by telephone on the spot. After visiting the consulate general, they discussed economic cooperation for an hour and a half. Chen Juesheng hosted a banquet at 7 PM on Haihe Road in Beining. Zhang Zizhong, Qi Xieyuan, Gan Yitang, Cao Rulin, Lu Zongxing, Chen Zhongfu, and others were invited to accompany him. Li is scheduled to meet with the Tientsin banking and business circles on the 20th, return to Peiping on the 21st to report to Song, and go south to the central government around the 25th to request instructions, and go to Shanghai to meet with all parties. He will return north in ten days and begin to carry out economic matters according to the steps. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tientsin) Li Sihao said that he met with Tadashi today and was introduced to meet with Hashimoto Kazuchi and other staff members of the military headquarters. He informed them of the process of taking office in the north and solicited their opinions on the economic development of North China. Tadashi expressed that it was very good, saying that the Japanese side is extremely eager for Hebei and Chahar to have a responsible person to handle economic cooperation with the Japanese side. He then temporarily contacted and met with Horiuchi, who said that the Japanese side hopes that the economic development of North China will be realized as soon as possible. He personally believes that since economic cooperation is mentioned, the first decision should be the issue of funds. Although many items are listed, it is difficult to proceed without money. The Japanese side advocates it first, but it is also unable to raise huge amounts of money. The economic power of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is even more limited. If there is no prior planning, it will be difficult to do anything. Taking the Tsinan-Shijiazhuang Railway as an example, the construction cost is 20 million yuan, and Hebei and Chahar will bear 10 million. Where will this money come from? It must be planned in advance. Song has expressed to me that he is determined to do it according to the principle of mutual benefit. I believe that there are many economic cooperation items. If there is no procedure, the Hebei-Chahar Political Council is limited by manpower and financial resources. How can it be done at the same time? Therefore, when meeting with Tadashi and Horiuchi today, I said that the Japanese side should clearly indicate a scope so that it can be used as a target for progress. Although the Xingzhong Company is unique, it still has the same goal as the military headquarters and is secretly controlled by it. (19th Dispatch)</p>

He was told that the central government had not received a report in advance when Ambassador Kawagoe and Minister Zhang were discussing the adjustment of Japanese diplomacy.

As for whether it happened and what the process was, it is said that the central government has sent a telegram to investigate. (19th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) On the 19th, a Central News Agency reporter visited He Lian and inquired about his opinions on national economic construction. He said that the economy is the foundation of the people's livelihood and the source of the country's wealth. Therefore, whether the national economy is sound or not is closely related to the survival and development of the entire nation. However, the path of economic construction lies in increasing the production of national wealth and enriching the people's lives. The so-called increase in production must emphasize both industry and agriculture and use each other. The main points are to revitalize agriculture and build industry. The former should focus on improving production, transportation, and sales, while the latter should pay attention to the simultaneous development of light and heavy industries, and support the improvement of rural side businesses.

<h3>National Army Revolutionary Memorial</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Subsidizes Tax Revenue Methods</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that 30% of the stamp tax revenue of each province should be allocated for subsidies, because the income of each province would inevitably be in deficit due to the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes. Now, in order to simplify the remittance procedures for this subsidy tax, special methods have been formulated and are being promoted in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Hubei. Separate letters have been sent to the Central Bank, the six provincial governments, and the tax supervision committees of the six provinces for investigation and handling. The content of the method is as follows: the post offices in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Shandong, and Henan will deposit 30% of the stamp tax revenue collected by each county into the branches of the Central Bank in each province on a monthly basis, which will be collected as an account of the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, it will be reported to the Tax Administration and the provincial governments, and the provincial governments will assess the situation of the abolition of harsh and miscellaneous taxes in each county according to the 30% number of tax revenue, determine the number of allocations for each county, and consult with the tax supervision committees of each province to create a detailed list and send it to the Ministry of Finance. Then the Ministry of Finance will send a letter to the Central Bank to transfer the 30% stamp tax revenue stored by the Ministry of Finance to the branches of each province according to the number of items on the list, and directly remit it to the county governments of each province for collection, and obtain the official receipts from the county governments and send them to the Ministry. If the county governments have regular taxes to be paid to the provincial treasury, they may use the above funds to offset them. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yet Another Manifestation of the Power of Unity</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Han Fuju, the chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, rushed to Zhejiang a few days ago to have a formal meeting with President Jiang of the Executive Yuan. At the same time, Xu Yongchang, the Qingxiang Superintendent of Shanxi, Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi Province, and Ge Dingyuan, the Secretary-General of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council, also traveled to Hangzhou without prior arrangement. Although the duties of these individuals were officially different, some sought instructions on bandit suppression due to their responsibilities, while others reported on local political situations as part of their duties. In any case, at a time when the situation in North China is extremely tense, the fact that these important responsible individuals were able to meet on a timely basis is enough to attract the attention of ordinary people. The impact should not be underestimated. After waiting eagerly, we are happy to extend our very warm sympathy.</p>
<p>While Zhang Qun's trip to Sichuan is underway to adjust diplomatic relations, the alarms on the eastern border of Suiyuan are frequent, and the plotting of the unprincipled is becoming increasingly urgent. The background is not difficult to imagine. We also know that the desires of our neighbors are endless and insatiable. Unless we "threaten with threats," it will be impossible to curb their ambitions even by a slim chance. However, it is still believed that with sincere interactions between the two parties and the attention of the international community, even those with excessive greed will not be without regard for justice. Therefore, even if the situation in eastern Suiyuan is extremely complicated today, the bandit crowds who come out to disturb the border still belong to the unfilial elements in the country. Knowing that there are puppeteers behind the scenes, we know that there are others who are pulling the strings. Judging from their chaotic forces, it is not difficult to put them down. If the people of the country can all examine their behavior and encourage themselves with the concept of the nation, and not easily be used by others, then the current tenuous connection may not be broken suddenly. We fear that shameless traitors are willing to be accomplices, using their old tricks of infiltration and resorting to their tricks of coercion, so that the local authorities are gradually trapped in their trap. This is also what we deeply deplore. This decision of Han, Xu, and others to go south together to have frank meetings with the central authorities can at least dispel the anxieties that have been lingering in our hearts for a long time.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that only by concentrating the strength of the whole country can we resist foreign aggression and save the nation. We also firmly believe that under the principle of resisting foreign aggression and saving the nation, there is nothing that cannot bring the whole country to unity. Therefore, unity is the only important task today. And the grand plan after unity should be the steps that should be determined urgently at present. The fact that the affairs of Guangdong and Guangxi, which were not easy to sort out, were resolved quickly in a short period of time is because of the requirements of the times, and there must be a united situation. The fact that the senior officials in North China do not often meet on weekdays and there are inevitably differences in opinion can now calmly express their feelings to each other during the cup-passing, which can be said to be yet another manifestation of the power of unity. Here, we can more firmly believe that under the formation of united forces, any national crisis cannot be overcome. At the same time, we can also understand that those who threaten us with threats are not precisely the driving force behind the promotion of unity in our country?</p>
<h3>Kirkpatrick Appointed British Representative to China: Credit Lending Plan Will Be Strictly Based on Commerce</h3>
<p>(London) Mr. Kirkpatrick, a Conservative Member of the British Parliament, has been appointed as the representative of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to China, responsible for studying various proposals under the new Sino-British export credit lending plan. It is reported that Mr. Kirkpatrick will work jointly with the British government trade representative originally stationed in China. Mr. Kirkpatrick, who is currently 58 years old, previously engaged in the import business of British textiles in Delhi, India, for many years. He also represented Samuel &amp; Co. in Japan, the East Asia Telephone Company in Hong Kong, and London bankers in Chile. In addition, he also traveled to Athens for financial matters. Mr. Nicholson, the manager of the Export Credits Guarantee Department, told a Reuters reporter today that "We have received many proposals requiring guarantees, all advocating that British manufacturers should make good use of the opportunities in China. However, due to the rapid changes in the current situation in China, it is particularly difficult to assess the degree of risk in credit lending. The newly appointed representative to China, Mr. Kirkpatrick, will be in charge of all financial and economic proposals. The implementation of this plan will be strictly based on commerce and will not provide any subsidies to British trade." Mr. Nicholson also denied the rumors of British loans to China, continuing, "The original intention of appointing Mr. Kirkpatrick as the representative to China is only to enable domestic manufacturers to occupy a more important position in China's trade, because China has seen amazing developments in industry over the past two years, and everything is now more stable than before. We are prepared to take on some of the responsibility for the risks. China's great demand for factory machinery is mostly supplied by foreign countries." At the end of his conversation, Mr. Nicholson solemnly declared that arms manufacturers would not be allowed to participate in this credit lending plan. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Ciano Questions Rome: Italy and Germany Seek Cooperation, Discuss Three Matters, Decide on Unified Steps: Relationship Between the Two Dictatorial Countries Will Likely Be Closer</h3>
<p>(Rome) Count Ciano, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was originally scheduled to fly to Berlin tomorrow, but he has advanced the trip to this afternoon, traveling to Germany with the German Ambassador, Mr. Hassel. He is expected to stay in Berlin for three days and then go to Berchtesgaden to meet with the German leader, Hitler, and stay for two days. Informed sources recently announced that Foreign Minister Ciano's trip may bring back Germany's recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Although the official mission of the Foreign Minister's trip has not been announced, responsible sources claim that the Foreign Minister and the German authorities do not intend to negotiate any special issues, but will discuss the following three matters with the German leader Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath: (1) Preparations for the Vienna Conference of the diplomatic authorities of Italy, Austria, and Hungary (this conference is scheduled to begin on November 9); (2) The attitudes that Germany and Italy should take regarding the future Locarno Treaty after Belgium restores its neutral status; (3) The issue of communism in Europe, among which the third is considered the most important. Observers say that the mutual understanding between Germany and Italy will be highlighted by Ciano's trip. Although Germany and Italy have not established a formal agreement or signed a treaty of alliance, the diplomatic policies pursued by both sides are consistent. In addition, there is another purpose, which is to promote bilateral economic relations, as seen by the recent visits of many German industrial leaders to northern Italy and Rome. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is scheduled to depart for Berlin tomorrow. The renowned journalist Bertina recently published an article in the Echo de Paris, commenting, "The most important aspect of the international diplomatic situation this week will be Ciano's trip. It is difficult for the foreign policies of Italy's fascist government and Germany's National Socialist government to achieve complete harmony. Therefore, the mission of Ciano's trip is to find a way for Italy and Germany to cooperate, so that the two countries can share common interests in the short term. However, in order to prevent the progress of National Socialist Pan-Germanism, the Italian government cannot completely break away from Britain and France. But in order to expand its position in the Mediterranean and Africa, it must feign intimacy with Germany to control Britain and France. This is the subtle use of Italian foreign policy. In short, the purpose of Ciano's trip is to ensure that Germany promises to take consistent steps with Italy on all important issues." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano will soon go to Berlin to visit German Foreign Minister Neurath and exchange views with German leader Hitler. Messengers between Germany and Italy are constantly traveling back and forth. Mr. Ciano's trip is only one of them. General Milch, a senior official of the German Air Ministry, recently visited General Val, a senior official of the Italian Air Force. He departed today after completing his official duties. As soon as Mr. Milch left, General Himmler, the German Chief of Police, arrived to visit Mr. Bocchini, the head of the Italian secret political police. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3>Large Political Gathering in Vienna: Schuschnigg's Speech: Expounding the Advantages of Constitutional Policies: The Audience is Particularly Indifferent</h3>
<p>(Vienna) Austrian Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg announced yesterday that the legitimist movement was legal and foreshadowed a referendum on the future political system of Austria. The whole of Europe was surprised. However, when he spoke to Austria's largest political gathering in history in Schwechat today, the audience was particularly indifferent. The gathering was carefully prepared and announced in advance. 150,000 people from Lower Austria were transported to the meeting free of charge by train. The authorities prepared a rich breakfast to await the crowds attending the meeting and gave each person a ticket, which could be used to watch a football game or a drama movie. No fewer than 390,000 people participated in the meeting. Dr. Schuschnigg spoke from a newly built 70-foot-high platform, trying to explain the advantages of his "guild" constitutional policy, but failed to arouse enthusiastic welcome from the audience. Dr. Schuschnigg then promised to reform Austrian society, reduce coal prices, and provide school children with free milk from the state, but the crowd remained silent and unmoved. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Blum Calls On the French Popular Front to Unite: Support the Government to Realize the Political Program: Do Not Give Enemy Parties a Chance to Exploit</h3>
<p>Orléans, France: Prime Minister Blum delivered an important political speech at the joint banquet of the Radical Socialist Party of the Loiret Province tonight. The speech lasted an hour. The Prime Minister first described the French political situation before the general election in May of this year, then analyzed the situation since the establishment of the Popular Front government for four and a half months, as well as the inappropriate situation caused by social agitation. Finally, he presented an outline of the actions to be taken in the future. The speech was very long. A summary is as follows:</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said, "Opinions may differ on whether we like or dislike what we have done, but we have already done something. This cannot be denied by any honest gentleman. I would now like to raise a question that urgently needs to be resolved: Should we continue to work? Will we still receive the support of the original majority in Parliament? Will we still be supported by the original political and social groups? If we put this question to the people for judgment, the answer will be undoubtedly no, because the ideals of the Popular Front have not been damaged in the slightest since last June, and the people's enthusiasm for the Popular Front has not diminished in the slightest. If so, how can we re-divide at this time? Although the formation of the Popular Front was obtained with the permission of the people, some people still express doubts about the internal structure and duration of the Popular Front. This has caused unrest among our friendly parties, and our enemy parties want to take the opportunity to attack the Communist Party. Regarding these doubts, I dare to answer that if a party withdraws from the Popular Front and no longer trusts the government, the only result will be to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold a re-election to solicit public opinion."</p>
<p>The Prime Minister then recounted the history of the formation of the Popular Front, saying, "The Popular Front was born on the day of the February 6, 1934, Paris riots. Fascist groups were the parents who gave birth to the Popular Front. At that time, the power of fascist groups was quite rampant. Therefore, political parties and groups willing to protect democracy and freedom were forced to unite. In any period of French history, if the harmonious cooperation of the workers and peasants has not been obtained, the republican system has not been able to obtain effective protection. As for the issue that most Radical Party members are worried about, it is the issue of legal order, because the waves of labor unrest are endless, and workers often occupy factories. This is what worries the Radical Party the most. I think that in order to save the republican system, the first thing is to continue to maintain legal order. Constant social disputes will inevitably make the bourgeoisie and farmers fear. If the Popular Front government cannot restore true order in spirit and in practice, it will become weak and powerless." Mr. Blum added, "If the Communist Party withdraws from the Popular Front, then those reactionaries know that the Socialist Party is also Marxist, and they will inevitably take a further step to force the Socialist Party to withdraw from the Popular Front. If so, then only you (referring to the Radical Party) will bear the brunt of the conflict."</p>
<p>At this point, Mr. Blum described the general situation in France and Europe, saying, "Two years ago, Europe was divided into two major camps: democratic politics and fascism. Now it is not. Some people are now trying to divide Europe into two major camps: dictatorial politics and communism. In France, those who wish to maintain order no longer think of dictatorship. Any party of the Popular Front has only one purpose: to continue to seek progress within the scope of order and democracy. To guarantee the development of democratic politics and to seek social democratization through political democratization is nothing more than expanding the principles of the French Revolution of 1789 on the scale of modern society. Within the Popular Front, each party should maintain the right to autonomy, but this autonomy should be used to make a joint effort by each party. Although these two things seem to be contradictory, they are actually complementary." In conclusion, he said, "We should seek thorough reforms, but this reform does not conflict with the property system. We aim to create a new society, but the method we use is only to improve the existing society." After Mr. Blum finished his speech, the whole room applauded for a long time. Then, they sang the Marseillaise and the Internationale together and announced the end of the meeting. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Japan submitted an annual report on the mandated islands to the League of Nations today, stating that Japan has unswervingly complied with the League of Nations' prohibition on turning the mandated islands in the South Pacific into military bases. Since the Japanese government established the South Seas Bureau in 1932, the troops stationed on the islands have gradually withdrawn, and the local indigenous people have not engaged in military training. The development of port services on the islands is purely commercial. Japan also allowed 58 foreigners to visit the islands in 1935, including seven Americans. No defense-style naval base has been built on the islands. The report's wording is mild. It is generally believed to be a gesture of goodwill towards Britain and the United States.

<h3>Western Rebel Army Continues to Occupy Important Towns: The Capital's Position Becomes More Precarious: The Vanguard is Only Sixteen Miles Away: Cannon Fire Can Be Heard Clearly</h3>
<p>Talavera: It is heard that the rebel army has occupied Robledo de Chavela, 26 miles northwest of Madrid. This is the last major defense line of the Escorial Palace, built by King Philip II to commemorate the victory over the French army at the Battle of Saint-Quentin on Saint Lawrence Day (August 10) in 1557. It is expected that the fall of the palace will have a great impact on morale. The rebel army, which captured the town of Illescas on the Madrid-Toledo road yesterday, asked its commander this morning to allow it to attack Madrid immediately, but the rebel commander did not approve it because the entire attack plan had to be carefully coordinated and carried out. The northwest of Madrid is mountainous, so the rebel army's mechanized forces have almost no use, resulting in the inability to advance as quickly as on the southern plains of the capital. The rebel army is only sixteen miles away from the capital in several places, so the sound of its cannon fire can be heard clearly in the suburbs of the capital. It is now believed that the fall of the important railway junction of Castillejo, on the Madrid-Valencia railway, has shaken the morale of the militia. Civil servants and employees of various businesses are now helping to dig trenches and build defensive works around the capital. They are very diligent. The rebel army is now eager to attack quickly, because snow has already fallen in the mountains. The Moorish troops are quite intolerant of the cold. Each person wears three or four layers of outerwear, otherwise they cannot stand on their own. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Talavera: Today, a rebel army column has occupied the town of Illescas, 24 miles from the capital on the Madrid-Toledo road, so the fall of Madrid is getting closer and closer. This town is a key point in the defense of the capital. The militia defending the town did not make a fierce resistance. Government troops are still holding several places in the mountains between Madrid and Escorial, but it seems that there is a risk of being cut off by the rebel army advancing from the southwest. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid: A special report from our reporter states that the National Army, led by Colonel Barron, engaged in a fierce battle with a battalion of shock troops belonging to the government army on the south side of the capital yesterday. The government army was defeated and retreated, leaving behind more than 200 bodies. The retreat was still in good order. The National Army immediately attacked and entered the city of Illescas (37 kilometers south of the capital). Four large three-engine aircraft belonging to the government army flew over the city. Two of them were shot down by fighter planes belonging to the National Army, and the remaining two escaped. In addition, a cavalry team led by Colonel Monasterio of the National Army advanced along the road from Toledo to the capital and has arrived at a certain place 14 kilometers from Aranjuez.

<p>Talavera: The rebel air force is very superior. Since the siege of Oviedo in northern Spain was lifted, it has almost surpassed the government air force, because the entire rebel air force can now be concentrated to attack the defenders of Madrid. At the same time, the Moorish troops and foreign troops who occupied Oviedo have formed two major columns and will soon depart to the provinces of Gijón and Santander on the coast of the Bay of Biscay to eliminate the government troops in the area. Also, the shock troops, volunteers, and foreign troops of the rebel army have victoriously entered the city of Oviedo yesterday and met with the besieged garrison there. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Seville: The rebel leader, Llanos, announced here on the radio today that the long-besieged city of Oviedo was occupied by the rebel army yesterday. The original besieged rebel army had 2,500 people. When the reinforcements entered the Oviedo church yesterday, only 300 people were found to be alive. It is claimed that more than 5,000 government troops died in the recent war in Oviedo. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3>It is Rumored That the Spanish Government Plans to: Request the League of Nations to: Convene a Special Meeting of the Council: Invoke Article 11 of the Covenant</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is rumored that the Spanish government is now planning to invoke Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant and request that the League of Nations Council convene a special meeting to discuss the issue of the non-intervention agreement in the domestic turmoil being violated, especially when the Soviet government withdraws from the Non-Intervention Enforcement Committee. This request should be made. However, the League of Nations Secretary has not received any information. (Article 11 of the League of Nations Covenant states that any situation that affects international relations and is sufficient to disrupt international peace or endanger the good understanding on which international peace depends, any member state of the League of Nations may request the Secretary-General to convene a meeting of the Council.) (Havas, 19th) According to the Asahi Shimbun, Minister of the Army Terauchi and Minister of the Navy Nagano have been strongly urging the government to implement administrative reforms. It has now been decided to ease this pressure and cooperate with Prime Minister Hirota in order to carry out gradual adjustments. The Prime Minister is willing to postpone this move until after the Diet session to avoid causing a cabinet crisis. This has also been accepted in principle by the Ministers of the Army and Navy. It is heard that the cabinet will now concentrate on preparing a new budget. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of electricity control, which will be handled by the government departments, is of great importance. After the three-minister meeting on the 18th, the original draft of the Ministry of Communications, which is based on private ownership and national operation, will be the main body. It has been decided to refer to the opposition and add several revised terms to approve it. In the afternoon of the 19th, Minister of Communications Riemumoto was added, and a four-minister meeting was held. After deliberations by the four related cabinet members, the government is now implementing one of its important national policies, electricity control, and the pending electricity issue has also been resolved in the government departments. Therefore, the government will focus all its efforts on compiling the budget for the coming year. The tax system reform related to it is being carefully studied by the Ministry of Finance. On the one hand, various provinces are now eager to review the budget and hold a budget cabinet meeting in mid-November. When compiling the budget, how to adjust the huge national defense budget and the budget required for the concretization of various national policies advocated by the government, and what is the issue of the limit of public debt issuance, are the most important issues in the budget compilation period. Therefore, Prime Minister Hirota, Minister of Finance Baba, Minister of the Army Terauchi, and Minister of the Navy Nagano will engage in frequent negotiations in the future. (Domei, 19th)</p>

<h3>Hurricane Strikes Japan, Turns Toward Southeast Waters, Mainland Honshu May Be Spared Disaster</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) A hurricane with a wind speed of 36.5 meters per second, which struck the Okinawa Islands and was expected to move towards Honshu, has since changed direction and turned northeast-east. At 6:00 AM on the 19th, it was moving at a speed of 25 kilometers per hour between southeast of Okinawa Island and South Daito Island.

<h3>Certain Party Implements Poisoning of Chahar North, Heavy Opium Taxes, Farmers' Subtle Groans, Large Expansion of a Certain Party's Airport in Zhangbei</h3>
<p>Zhangbei Communication: Since the six counties of Duolun, Guyuan, Baochang, Kangbao, Shangyi, and Shangdu in Chahar North were forcibly occupied by puppet troops last year, a special situation has been created, and a poisoning policy has been implemented to kill the people of Chahar North. The general jackals of a certain party, catering to the wishes of a certain party, ordered farmers to plant opium as a source of income for the puppet troops. At the beginning of opium planting, a five yuan opium tax was paid per acre. This income alone was considerable. After the farmers planted, additional taxes were repeatedly added, totaling no less than one yuan per acre. When the opium seedlings grew and were about to be harvested, the puppet government again issued a notice to the planting households in each county, requiring each acre of land to pay 30 taels of official opium, with an official price of 6 jiao per tael. Most of this official opium is used to supply a certain party for the manufacture of drugs. This year's opium in various counties in Chahar North, due to weather conditions, has not grown well, and the harvest is difficult to expect. The most miserable are the general poor farmers. The amount of land they own is already small. In order to seek immediate benefits, they have all abandoned farming and changed to opium. The food for the winter and spring seasons depends entirely on opium. Now encountering this situation, they all frown, groan, and complain bitterly. If the amount harvested per acre is not enough to pay the 30 taels to the government, the puppet government will purchase it at the official price of 6 jiao per tael, and then the puppet government will sell it at one yuan per tael. The taxes are extremely harsh, and the exploitation is heavy. The general farmers are almost left with nothing.</p>
<p>Looking at Zhangbei County, outside the East Gate, there is an airport built by a certain party, which is the largest of a certain party's airports in Chahar North. The original area has reached six hectares. At the beginning of this month, a certain party resumed expansion, and it has now reached about ten hectares. It still seems insufficient and is still under active construction. Li Shouxin himself is currently in Zhangbei, working very hard every day. He has also transferred 500 elite troops from various puppet units under his command and reorganized them into a special task force for active training. Since Li invaded Chahar North last year, although his troops have nominally expanded to five divisions, in reality there are only more than 2,600 people. Most of the troops are cavalry. However, Li seems to take the training of his subordinates extremely seriously. He must take time every day to supervise the training ground. His troop camps are all inside and outside Zhangbei County. Other bandit troops have now all left. There is only Wang Ying's military station in the city. The station is currently purchasing a large amount of food and transporting it to Shangdu for military rations. In the past two months, there have often been six aircraft stationed at the airport outside the East Gate, flying to Suidong from time to time for reconnaissance. (16th)</p>
<h3>Road Construction and Bandit Suppression in Northeastern Fujian, Pacification Headquarters Has Been Moved to Jian'ou</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Jiang Dingwen, the Director of Pacification stationed in Fujian, has moved the Pacification Headquarters from Zhangzhou to Jian'ou in order to supervise the construction of the northeastern Fujian highway and suppress scattered bandits. The headquarters started to move on the 14th of this month in three batches. The first batch, led by Adjutant He Guozhen and six others, arrived in the province by car from Zhangzhou on the 16th, along with the guards, and will go to Jian'ou on the 18th to arrange the new Pacification Headquarters. The second batch, led by Adjutant Director Feng Chizhong and others, will transport equipment to the province around the 20th and then to Jian'ou. The third batch, led by Chief of Staff Li Jianai and others, will bring files to the province and then to Jian'ou before the 25th. As for Jiang Dingwen, he arrived in Xiamen from Zhangzhou on the 15th and plans to visit Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou first, and then go to the northeastern Fujian Pacification Headquarters in Minbei from Zhejiang. After the move to Jian'ou, it is heard that Li Yangjing, the Commander of Qingxiang in the Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi border area, will set up his headquarters in Zhangzhou.</p>
<p>The northeastern Fujian highway project, from Jiangshan on the Zhejiang border through Pucheng in Fujian Province to Jian'ou, is now open to traffic. The section from Jian'ou through Shaowu to Guangze on the Jiangxi border is currently under construction and will be completed in ten days. The section from Ningde through Fuding to Taishun on the Zhejiang border is now ordered by the Military Affairs Commission to use military labor to open up construction simultaneously in both provinces, and to complete it in a short period of time. The Construction Department will send engineers to guide the work in the coming days.</p>
<p>As for the bandit situation, the remnants of bandits in northern Fujian were previously under tight search and suppression by the army, and their supply routes were cut off. Their food was exhausted, and the situation was extremely difficult. Recently, taking advantage of the movement of the army, they harassed the area again, often falsely using the name of Huang Ligui to confuse the public and exaggerate their power. They also plan to rob farmers of their newly harvested autumn grain. Jianyang, Jianguo, Shaowu, Jiangle, and Shunchang counties have suffered the most. In recent days, the people of various counties in northern Fujian have asked the Provincial Government and Pacification Headquarters to quickly dispatch troops to suppress the bandits in order to prevent the bandits from growing stronger. In eastern Fujian, since the stationed troops were transferred to other places a month ago, the bandit forces have also spread again. Recently, the remnants of Liu Ying's troops have fled from the Jiangxi border into Fuding, and their strength has been restored. The entire county, except for the county seat, has almost no place without traces of bandits. The so-called pseudo-Su troops are even more ruthless in killing dissidents. The people are extremely panicked and flee into the city in groups. The provincial government has been informed and has ordered the Huang Su troops of the 2nd Security Regiment stationed in Gutian to rush to suppress them. (October 17th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Industry and Commerce Are Declining Daily; Government and Banks Conduct Loan Relief; Business Community Asks for Low-Interest Loans to Revive Finance</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: In recent years, due to the decline of industry and commerce in Guangdong Province, the sharp decline in exports, and the annual trade deficit, the social finance has been gradually exhausted. Today, the situation is becoming increasingly strained. Most of the originally large stores have closed down, and the few remaining small-capital factories are in a precarious situation. Those who care about the national economy cannot help but shudder. According to a recent survey, in the province's industries, except for one or two state-run factories that are slightly profitable due to controlled operations, in Guangzhou's private factories, there are only two with capital of more than 200,000 yuan, three with more than 50,000 yuan, and 24 with more than 10,000 yuan. The state of decline is evident. The authorities have the intention of providing relief. In addition to the tobacco leaf loan previously organized by the Department of Finance, borrowing 2 million yuan from the Shanghai Bank to develop the native tobacco leaf in Nanxiong, they have recently negotiated with the Shanghai banking community to borrow 10 million yuan, with monthly interest between six and eight percent. The government will provide considerable collateral. The loan is intended to develop the silk and cotton industries, etc. Regarding the loan to develop sericulture and weaving in Shunde, it is heard that the Provincial Bank and the Shanghai Jiaotong Bank will jointly handle it. The Provincial Bank previously sent staff to Shunde and the surrounding areas for investigation, which has now been completed. Once the Jiaotong Bank sends staff south to negotiate a solution, the loan plan can be signed with local silk factories. The Department of Construction has recently formulated plans to develop private water conservancy, chemical industry, mining, fisheries, dyeing and silk industry, and stationery manufacturing industry, etc., welcoming investment from overseas Chinese in Nanyang and Hong Kong merchants. Looking at the above matters, some are in the planning stage, and some have been realized. It may not be a good hope for the future of Guangdong's industries. However, on the merchants' side, there are also people who want to independently run industries and expand businesses, but they cannot do anything without resources due to years of losses. Therefore, in recent days, most merchants have requested the Municipal Industry Federation to forward a letter to the government, asking the provincial and municipal banks to provide large loans to maintain the existing commerce and seek development. The Industry Federation received the letter and has presented it to the Department of Finance yesterday, asking the municipal bank to handle it. The letter stated, "Since our city was attacked by the world economic depression, the financial situation has become increasingly exhausted, and industry and commerce have been declining daily. The suffering of merchants and people is difficult to describe. In the blink of an eye, the end of the year is approaching, and the demand for funds is extremely urgent. If we do not provide timely relief, then the turnover will definitely feel inflexible, collapse one after another, and fall into a state of no return. The people are waiting to be rescued from their predicament, and the government's tax revenue will also be lost in conjunction. (Excerpt) The current phenomenon of decline cannot be rescued without the government banks providing large amounts of credit to revive the withered fish. Therefore, last month, we presented a request to order the provincial and municipal banks to allocate 20 million yuan in legal currency, allowing the people to mortgage their industries to obtain funds for turnover. Later, the Provincial Bank released a small number of loans, which can temporarily help at the moment, but it is not enough to maintain the overall situation. Now, we see that the times are difficult and funds are scarce, and all industries are on the verge of extinction, urgently waiting for fresh troops to save them from danger. If the request is realized in the short term, the citizens' real estate can be transformed into circulating gold, not only will the financial situation be active, but all industries will be revived, and the industry will also rise accordingly. Overseas Chinese will inevitably hear the news and be inspired to bring back their capital stored in foreign banks to invest in real estate. The municipality will prosper accordingly, and tax revenue will also increase immeasurably. In this transition, both the public and private sectors will receive great benefits (Excerpt). We hereby submit a document to your department, asking you to approve it and order the provincial and municipal banks to raise 20 million yuan, carefully formulate regulations for industrial mortgages, stipulate a weekly interest rate of five to six percent, with a term of half a year. After the expiration, permission will still be granted to clear the interest and renew the single, release credit on a regular basis, and announce it widely to help the financial situation."

<h3>Kunshan Joint Telegram Requests Verification and Reduction of Rent and Taxes</h3>
<p>Because the weather has been appropriate from spring to summer in the agricultural fields of various townships in the county, the rice seedlings have all shown a thriving appearance. Therefore, the general farmers are all full of expectations for a bumper harvest. However, since entering autumn, there has been an unusual drought, coupled with frequent winds. The planted mid-autumn rice and late rice have been slow to emerge, resulting in damage. There are many small and solid ears. The district chiefs especially telegraphed the county government on the 19th, requesting that the rent and taxes be verified and reduced in order to relieve the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>North China: Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Procedures, The First Step is to Exploit Longyan Iron Mine; Active Promotion of Cotton Industry Improvement; Economic Commission Has Appointed Japanese Advisors; Today also Expresses Sympathy for Li Sihao</h3>
<p>Beiping Communication: After Li Sihao took office as the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Economic Committee, he actively proceeded with the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. The Japanese advisors of the Economic Commission have also been appointed as Nakai. On the 16th, the Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Horiuchi, accompanied by Vice Consuls Kishi Ichi and Nishida, visited Li in Ping to discuss everything in advance. Li scheduled to visit Horiuchi at 9:30 AM on the 18th, and at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, he visited the commander of the Japanese Garrison Army, Tanida Wanichiro, and Chief of Staff Kyo Hon-gun. On the same day, he also visited Horiuchi to exchange views on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation issues. He will also have contacts with the Tianjin banking community. He will stay in Tianjin for about two or three days, and then return to Ping. The Economic Commission will hold a meeting on the 21st, and Li will rush to participate, explaining the process of contacting the law and continue to study everything. Before the end of the month, he will travel to Beijing and Shanghai, and then return north to work.</p>
<p>Regarding the implementation procedures of economic cooperation, the first step has been decided to resume the exploitation of the Longyan Iron Mine. The personnel in charge of the preparations have been appointed by the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee and will be announced soon. The takeover work will begin at that time. The exploitation plan is also said to have been drafted, and it can be roughly divided into three parts: (1) An investigation of the mine's history. Since the establishment of the company, it has never started work and has been going on for ten years. Due to the lack of management, the air pipes and water gates have been damaged. Two years ago, the company occasionally painted the chimneys, but recently, due to the lack of management, they have rusted red. The repair will take five to eight months to complete. (2) The capital for restoring the mine. The first is the start-up cost, estimated at 3-4 million yuan, or at least 3 million yuan. How to raise this amount is being studied by those in charge. The authorities believe that there is nothing wrong with the Sino-Japanese joint venture or the Japanese investment in the future. However, it has not been specifically discussed at present. It is said that technicians will be hired from the Japanese side. (3) Regarding transportation, although the company is located in Shijingshan, Pingtong, the mining area is located between Xuanhua and Longguan in Chahar Province. In the future, when iron is mined, if it is transported on the existing Pinghan Railway, it must pass through the Nankou Tunnel, which is a zigzag road, which is inconvenient and hinders the speed of time. In the future, it is also planned to discuss with the Pinghan Railway Bureau to lay branch lines to facilitate transportation. However, these are all plans. How will they be realized in the future? It is still not possible to be completely sure.</p>
<p>As for the issue of improving the cotton industry in North China, the Japanese are also actively proceeding with all their efforts. The Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has recruited agricultural experts and organized an agricultural guidance group. The members of the group are Miura Kazuo, Hasuike Kōji, Hasekoya Ken, Nakahara Shigeki, and Dr. Fūo. They are led by Dr. Kodaira Ken'ichi, the Director of Economic Rehabilitation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. They are currently investigating everything in the Northeast and will soon complete the investigation. It is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin by the Pingchen traffic on the 24th, and will also come to Ping. Their task is to specifically investigate the management, agricultural institutions, production situation, and domestic and foreign market trade conditions and relationships of general agriculture in North China, to study agricultural products and crop varieties, etc., in order to provide a reference for the specific improvement of cotton seeds in North China. If this work is completed, Japanese cotton can be sold all over the world.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of repairing the Qiangshi Road, although the Sino-Japanese sides have contacted each other several times, they are still studying each other and have not reached the negotiation stage. The Japanese also admitted this. When the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in China, Imai Takeo, met with reporters on the 16th, he expressed the Japanese attitude towards the issue of economic cooperation, saying that Chairman Song and Commander Tanida had previously discussed Sino-Japanese economic cooperation matters in Tianjin, and the results were good. The Japanese side earnestly hopes that it will be put into practice as soon as possible, and also hopes that Li Sihao, who is responsible for this, will quickly seek to proceed so that it can be effective and increase the happiness of the people. As Li has expressed that his work here is entirely in accordance with the wishes of Chairman Song, the Japanese side, as an assistant to Song, will also give him sympathy and assistance under his consistent wishes.

<h3>Wuxi: Yarn and Cloth Cannot Meet Demand</h3>
<p>There are four or five weaving factories in the county, including Shenxin, Guangfeng, Guangqin, and Lixin. The internal facilities are very complete and the products are of high quality and are popular with people from all over the country. In the past half month, the market price of cotton yarn in the city has soared, which is a rare phenomenon in recent years. The Shen standard has risen to nearly 20 yuan per piece. The market price in the city has also risen accordingly, with each brand rising by 8 or 9 yuan per piece. People in the market are still unanimously bullish. On the 18th, the market price of each brand of cotton yarn rose again by several jiao to one yuan. According to people in the cotton yarn industry, the reason for the rise in the yarn market is that cotton sales have been smooth recently. Cotton weaving manufacturers have purchased large quantities of cotton yarn as much as possible, and the yarn appearing in the factory cannot meet the demand, resulting in soaring market prices. As for the reason for the smooth sales of cotton cloth, it is that the autumn harvest this year is abundant, and the rural economy is gradually recovering. At this cool autumn season, farmers are adding new clothes, and because Zhuang Ding training is being held everywhere this year, uniforms must be worn uniformly, so cotton cloth has a special sales route. In the future, the market price still has a tendency to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Market Price is Firm</h3>
<p>Since the spring cocoons entered the market, the silk factories in the city have started their operations one after another. Until recently, the number of silk factories that have started their operations in the city and countryside has reached 36, with about 10,000 silk machines. All of them are profitable. Most of the dried cocoons stored in various factories can be worked until the end of the year. As for the market price of Chinese silk, since August, the European and American silk markets have been rising again. The weaving factories in New York and other places are gradually importing as autumn sales have arrived and the inventory of raw silk is not abundant. At present, the highest white factory of Chinese silk can be sold at more than 730 yuan per load, 13 or 15 standard high-white classics can be sold at 690 yuan per group, and 20 or 12 standard ordinary silk can also be sold at 650 yuan. Compared with the previous low market price, it has risen by 30 or 40 yuan. As for the market price of dried cocoons, it is currently rising with it, at 150 yuan per load. Observing the situation, there is still a tendency to continue to rise. Chen Qixiang and Ni Lisheng, silk cocoon merchants in Dongting Town, Second District, pooled more than 5,000 yuan to create a small silk factory in Xintang Bridge in view of the better silk market. They are preparing to install more than 100 silk machines. They are currently renovating the houses and working day and night. They must start work at the beginning of the month. The future of silk cocoons is gradually becoming optimistic.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Seventh District Murder Case</h3>
<p>Pan Yinchuan, from Dongjietou, Caoxi Township, Seventh District of Wu County, has a son named Ronghai, aged twenty-seven. Recently, Xu Laoer from Dongtai acted as a matchmaker, and he married the daughter of Jiang Zhicheng from Houyu. The wedding was originally scheduled for the fifteenth of this month, but due to travel fatigue on that day, it was changed to the sixteenth for ancestral rites. During the ceremony, Zhang Canru and Wang Qiudao suddenly demanded repayment of debts from Xu Laoer, arguing for a long time outside the Pan family's gate. This led to a fight, and Xu, being outnumbered, was struck in a vital area and collapsed to the ground, dying shortly after. The groom, Ronghai, realizing he had caused trouble, ran to inform the Jia head, who reported it to the local court. On the seventeenth, the court sent officials to the village for an autopsy and took Pan Ronghai into the city for interrogation. One account says that Pan Ronghai borrowed money from the matchmaker Xu Laoer when he got engaged, and Xu demanded repayment on the sixteenth. Ronghai then incited the guests to beat Xu Laoer to death, making Ronghai the real culprit, who was arrested for investigation. The local prosecutor's office opened a court hearing on the eighteenth and questioned Pan Ronghai, who vehemently denied inciting the murder. The court then ordered his detention, pending the arrest and investigation of other perpetrators.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Dysentery Rampant in Prison</h3>
<p>Recently, due to unfavorable weather conditions, dysentery has been rampant in the county prison. Most of those afflicted do not survive. In addition to several deaths already, yesterday (the eighteenth), a drug offender named Zhou He and a military prisoner, Ding Shigen, both died from dysentery. The prison staff reported the deaths to the county for burial.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Canal Water Storage for Navigation</h3>
<p>Xu Dingkang, director of the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau, stated that since autumn, the canal's water level has been gradually decreasing. Recently, it has dropped by more than five inches. The Qingjiang Zheng Gate records show that the canal's water level is only one zhang and eight chi and three cun, a decrease of one zhang compared to the high-water season. Due to the drop in water level, areas around Mapengwan and Jieshou are gradually becoming dry, and there is a risk of squeezing the river. Director Xu decided to close all the gate openings along the canal, as well as the Phoenix and Dongluo gates, to store water for navigation. Additionally, planting season has passed in the counties south of the canal, so there is no need to drain water. He has now telegraphed Qi Shou'an, director of the Jiangshi section of the works department, as well as Jiangdu, Gaobao, and Huaian counties, ordering them to immediately close all gate openings and dams along the canal to store water for navigation. After closing the gates, all shipping can proceed without obstruction, and the Jizhen ferry can also operate smoothly.</p>
<h3>Building Javanese-style Public Toilets</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Dantu Town Health Office has been guiding the townspeople in dredging ditches, which has now been completed. Currently, they are focusing on improving private toilets and converting all conveniently located toilets for public use into public toilets, all in the Javanese style. Construction has already begun and should be completed within days.</p>
<h3>Nantong Military and Police Confer to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>Recently, banditry has been rampant in Tongcheng. In addition to strictly checking for infiltrators in the coastal ports along the river, the special commissioner has convened responsible military and police personnel to discuss the defense of the city and suburbs and advance the winter defense preparations. Separate patrols of local militia will be organized in the district townships, and all remote small ports will be blocked by the Water Police.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Streamlining Highway Operations</h3>
<p>The director of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department stated that the Chang-Zhe Highway in eastern Zhejiang has been poorly managed, the road surface is damaged, and there is a lack of vehicles. To facilitate transportation, he has convened representatives of the highway company to discuss and decided to take over the highway for government operation. He has scheduled to take over operations and continue traffic from the twenty-first of this month, and to increase the number of vehicles to benefit travelers. To further streamline highway operations, he has scheduled a meeting of the directors of all provincial management offices for November 1st to discuss improvement strategies.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Shengjiawu Major Fire</h3>
<p>At 2:15 PM on the fifteenth, a fire broke out in the home of Sheng Alian, a resident of Shengjiawu in eastern Xiaoshan, due to carelessly leaving a fire in the firewood while making tea. As the weather was dry and there had been no rain, everything was susceptible to fire, and it quickly spread to the neighboring firewood shed. In an instant, the flames soared into the sky and then spread to the wealthy Sheng Pinshan's house. The smoke filled the air, and the home of the gentry Sheng Lianxin was also in danger. The two Yilong rescue teams from Shuangfengtang had already arrived after hearing the alarm. They worked hard to protect and extinguish the fire at Sheng Lianxin's large residence, but the corner of the east wing had already been reduced to ashes. Eight houses were damaged, with forty-five rooms burned. Sheng Pinshan suffered the greatest losses, with over three thousand liang of silkworm silk from the past four to five years, stored and unsold, and other belongings, all unable to be moved out and burned. Pinshan is Sheng Lianxin's uncle and is quite wealthy. After inspecting the eight houses, the losses are estimated to be over 20,000 gold. The fire was extinguished from 2:15 PM to 4:40 PM.</p>
<h3>Cixi Rice Mill Bankrupt and Closed</h3>
<p>Hengji Rice Mill in Qiushe Town, eastern Cixi, was established by the current town mayor, Mai Yuanji, with his own investment. It has been open for over ten years, and its business was doing well. Since the decline of the rural economy, the mill has been superficially strong but internally weak, struggling to maintain operations. Due to excessive losses, it was finally announced to close down the other day. It is estimated that over 20,000 yuan is owed to various depositors, who are now requesting repayment. Mediation for repayment is underway.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Guangdong and Guangxi (6)</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Xiao'an</p>
<p>Guangzhou's Municipal Administration (Part 1)</p>
<p>Guangzhou established its municipal government in the seventh year of the Republic, initially named the Municipal Office. In the tenth year of the Republic, the Municipal Hall was established. In the seventeenth year, the Municipal Hall was renamed the Special Municipal Government. In the eighteenth year, the special municipal system was abolished and named the Guangzhou Municipal Government. It remains as such to this day. The current location is behind Central Park and operates as a joint office, but only the Finance, Land, Health, and Public Works Bureaus are attached. The Social, Public Utilities, and Education Bureaus, as well as the Water Management Office, Electricity Management Office, and Telephone Committee, are not located there. During the tenures of former mayors Cheng Tiangu and Liu Jiwen, although there was much talk of municipal construction, the dirtiness of the city and the disorderliness of the order still left a residual influence that has not been entirely eradicated. Furthermore, the citizens have had a negative impression of things such as the licensing of citizen's construction and the acceptance of students at city schools. Therefore, although Guangzhou has had a new municipal administration for more than ten years, it has not truly satisfied the citizens.</p>
<p>Since the current mayor, Zeng Yangfu, took office on August 10th of this year, it has been heard that he has been striving to reduce municipal expenses. Therefore, he abolished the Public Utilities and Education Bureaus and the new power plant. Public utilities affairs have been merged into the Public Works Bureau, education affairs have been merged into the Social Bureau, and new power plant affairs have been merged into the Electricity Management Office. At the same time, he is determined to move forward with all facilities, likely learning from the mistakes of previous mayors and hoping to remedy and innovate. The reporter visited Mayor Zeng at the Municipal Government. Mayor Zeng informed me in great detail about the recent central work of the various bureaus of the Municipal Government. Here is a brief description to give a glimpse:</p>
<p>Matters concerning the Social Bureau: (1) Conducting a population survey. Guangzhou City conducted a population survey in October of the twenty-first year of the Republic. It has been four years since then, and there have been changes. The Social Bureau plans to conduct a new survey in conjunction with the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to obtain clear data. (2) Reorganizing social organizations. Many of Guangzhou's social organizations have not complied with the central regulations in terms of organization and dynamics over the past seven years. The Social Bureau plans to create a form to be filled out and send personnel for strict inspection, guiding them back on the right track and strengthening their organization. (3) Inspecting factories. The Social Bureau believes that the rise and fall of labor affairs depend on whether the factory law can be effectively implemented. Assessing its performance requires inspection to determine its quality. The bureau plans to create a form to be filled out by each factory and order them to organize welfare and labor affairs. (4) Promoting the national language. The Social Bureau plans to divide all city schools in the city into fifteen districts, with two national language study classes in each district. All teachers and staff of the city schools will join the study, with a five-month duration. (5) Registering teachers. The qualifications of teachers in Guangzhou schools are quite uneven, and many are not suitable for the subjects they teach. Moreover, they are all recommended and appointed by the principals. The Social Bureau plans to conduct a registration of teachers in municipal primary schools, limiting qualifications to normal school graduates. Military training will be provided during the winter vacation, and a committee will be set up to assist in the process. (6) Eliminating illiteracy. According to the city's population survey report in the twenty-first year of the Republic, 396,000 people were illiterate. The Social Bureau is now planning to launch a mass literacy campaign, establishing 1,000 literacy schools attached to various schools in the city, with a three-month duration. It is estimated that within two years, illiteracy in the city can be completely eliminated. (7) Expanding relief efforts. There are many poor people in Guangzhou City, and the relief homes only accommodate 5,000 people, making expansion necessary. Institutions such as orphanages, women's vocational training centers, and agricultural and forestry farms should also be increased. Nursing homes, infant daycare centers, and workers' residences also need to be built. The Social Bureau is planning and implementing all of these. (8) Rectifying charitable organizations. Abuses often occur in charitable organizations in the city. Therefore, the Social Bureau has specifically drafted measures to send personnel for detailed investigation and strict assessment for cleaning and rectification. (9) Job placement. Recently, various industries have declined, and unemployment has increased. Therefore, the Social Bureau plans to organize various labor job registrations, worker unemployment registrations, specialized talent unemployment registrations, and investigations of various public utilities, mechanical industries, and handicrafts, and employer investigations to implement job placement. (10) Editing and reviewing plays. The Social Bureau believes that various plays and scripts for actresses contain obscene and superstitious words. Therefore, it plans to hire people with playwriting knowledge to form a playwriting committee with the Guangzhou City Drama, Film, and Song Review Committee to provide guidance and remedy, guiding them towards goodness. (11) Increasing loans. The Social Bureau has provided small vendor loans with a fund of 2,000 yuan and household industry loans with a fund of 10,000 yuan, which citizens have found convenient. Now, the Social Bureau plans to raise more funds to increase circulation, increasing the small vendor loan fund to 5,000 yuan and the household industry loan fund to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Matters concerning the Health Bureau: (1) Universal immunization, (2) Prevention of infectious diseases, (3) Treatment of infectious diseases, (4) Establishing a smoking cessation hospital, (5) Reorganizing and expanding municipal hospitals, (6) Medical and pharmaceutical management, (7) Opening public health and other personnel training classes, (8) Popularizing health knowledge.</p>
<p>Matters concerning the Land Bureau: (1) Continuing forced land registration, (2) Completing the registration book, (3) Estimating land prices, (4) Temporary land tax, (5) Applying for surveying, (6) Boundary re-measurement, (7) Compiling cadastral maps, (8) Compiling cadastral registers.</p>

<p>Lu Xun, our nation's literary giant, suffered from severe lung disease and was once on the verge of death this summer. After treatment in Shanghai, he gradually recovered. On the 17th, due to excessive walking and talking, his condition suddenly deteriorated, and he suffered from severe shortness of breath and could not sleep. Despite emergency medical treatment, he passed away at approximately 5 AM yesterday morning. His body was moved to the International Funeral Home, and the encoffining ceremony is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon, with burial at the International Cemetery on the 22nd. The details of his passing are reported below:</p>
<p>Passed Away Yesterday Morning</p>

<p>Obituary and Funeral Arrangements</p>
<p>Lu Xun's body, after being moved to the International Funeral Home, will be open for condolences from all circles today and tomorrow. Burial will be at the Hongqiao International Cemetery on the 22nd. A funeral committee has been formed by Cai Yuanpei, Ma Xiangbo, Song Qingling, Uchiyama Kanzo, Smedley, Shen Junru, Mao Dun, Xiao Can, and others to handle all arrangements. An obituary was issued yesterday stating: "Mr. Lu Xun (Zhou Shuren) passed away from illness at his Shanghai residence at 5:25 AM on October 19, 1936, at the age of 56. His body will be moved to the International Funeral Home today. From 10 AM to 5 PM on the 20th, the public is invited to pay their respects. In accordance with Mr. Lu Xun's wishes, 'No one should receive a single penny for the funeral.' Except for sacrificial offerings, condolences, and wreaths, all monetary gifts are declined. This obituary is hereby issued."</p>
<p>Last Writings</p>
<p>During his life, he and his wife, Madam Xu Guangping, were deeply in love. Therefore, when he was ill, his wife personally prepared his medicine and cared for him diligently, almost without rest. Now that he has passed away, her grief is extreme. He leaves behind a son, only seven years old, named Haiying, who is studying at Continental Primary School and also attended to his father's side. According to Madam Xu, Mr. Lu Xun's condition worsened on the 17th, and he could not sleep. However, his mind was clear. Only his shortness of breath was severe. He did not leave any last words. He recently had an essay, "Death," published in the second issue of Zhongliu magazine, in which he drafted a will. At the time, it was only a literary composition, but it has now become a prophecy. In the future, it will be followed as he had written in his will.</p>
<p>Content of the Will</p>
<p>The seven articles of the will are transcribed below: (1) No one should receive a single penny for the funeral, but old friends are exempt from this rule. (2) Arrange the encoffining and burial quickly and be done with it. (3) Do not do anything related to commemoration. (4) Forget me and take care of your own life. If not, then you are truly a confused insect. (5) If the child grows up and has no talent, find some small things to live on, but do not become an empty-headed literary or art critic. (6) Do not take things that others allow you to have too seriously. (7) Do not approach those who harm others' teeth and eyes but oppose revenge and advocate tolerance.</p>
<p>Medical Treatment</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu Xun's close friend, Uchiyama Kanzo, the course of his illness was as follows: He suffered from pulmonary tuberculosis and was once on the verge of death this summer, treated by Dr. Suto. He had gradually recovered, and the doctor ordered him to move to Nagasaki Unsen for treatment, but it did not happen. Therefore, he rested in Shanghai. He still wrote this month. At 3 PM on the 17th, he took a walk in Hongkou Park. On the way back, he chatted with three or five friends at Uchiyama Bookstore for half an hour. At that time, the north wind was strong, so he quickly returned to rest. However, due to overwork, he suddenly developed a fever and severe shortness of breath. He could not sleep well at night. The next day, Dr. Suto was called for treatment. Because the situation was very dangerous, Dr. Song Bing from Fumin Hospital and Dr. Ishii from Ishii Hospital were consulted in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Final Moments</p>
<p>At that time, fearing a sudden change, a nurse, Tajima, was assigned to take care of him. Every 30 minutes, oxygen was inhaled to help his breathing, and cardiotonic injections were given. If there were no changes within two days, he could overcome the crisis. However, at approximately 5 AM yesterday morning, his breathing became more rapid. Three injections were ineffective. At 5:25 AM, he passed away from cardiac arrest. Only his wife, Madam Xu, his younger brother, Jianren, and the nurse were present.</p>
<p>Zhou's Life</p>
<p>Lu Xun, originally named Zhou Shuren, was from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. His family was poor in his youth. At the age of eighteen, he entered the Nanjing Naval Academy as a scholarship student. Later, he went to Japan to study at medical school. Before the Xinhai Revolution, he joined the Restoration Society and engaged in the national revolutionary movement. He also began to promote new literature. Three years before the Republic of China, he returned to China and successively served as a teacher at Shaoxing Normal School, a professor at Peking University, Xiamen University, and Guangzhou Zhongshan University. During the May Fourth Movement, he began to publish "Diary of a Madman" in New Youth magazine under the pen name Lu Xun, becoming a realist writer. In addition to novels, his sharp essays were widely circulated. His major works include the novels "Call to Arms" and "Wandering," and the essays "Hot Wind," "Huagai Collection," and "E'er Collection." He translated no less than dozens of works, including "A Youth's Dream," "Peach-Colored Clouds," "Fairy Tales," and "Art Theory." He passed away at the age of 56. His mother is still alive. His wife is Madam Xu Guangping, and his son, Haiying, is only seven years old. His elder brother, Zuoren, is a professor at Peking University, and his younger brother, Jianren, is an editor at the Commercial Press.</p>
<p>Japanese Friends Mourn</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo: After the news of the death of Chinese literary giant Lu Xun reached here, Japanese writers such as Aono Suekichi, Hayashi Fusao, Akita Ujaku, Fujimori Seikichi, Sato Haruo, Ishihama Tomoyuki, and Oka Kunio all expressed their grief. They all believed that Lu Xun's literary cultivation was profound and his social thought was outstanding. He was a star among the writers of Eastern countries.

<h3>Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Asks the Municipal Government to Negotiate with the Japanese Army on Cross-Border Patrols</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation presented a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating, "Regarding the petition, since the start of Sino-Japanese diplomatic negotiations, the people of the country have been looking forward to candid discussions and the adjustment of national relations to lay the foundation for peace in East Asia. However, the Japanese army stationed in Shanghai has been conducting cross-border patrols and setting up posts everywhere to interrogate pedestrians, causing public anxiety and unrest. This matter has been negotiated with the government before, but it has not been stopped. We believe that the Shanghai market has been extremely depressed since the January 28th Incident, and this impact makes the future unbearable. We respectfully request that the government continue negotiations to stop the Japanese army's cross-border patrols to reassure residents and maintain the market. We sincerely pray for this."</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhang Hui Talks About Overseas Chinese Affairs in Cuba</h3>
<p>More Than 20,000 Overseas Chinese Live Peacefully; A New Chinese School Has Been Established</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Hui, the Chinese Minister to Cuba, who has returned to China on leave, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge on the 18th. He decided to go to Beijing last night to report to Foreign Minister Zhang. Then he will quickly return to his hometown in Guangdong Province to visit his relatives. Yesterday morning, the reporter specially visited Mr. Zhang at his residence. The following is a record of Mr. Zhang's talk about the situation of overseas Chinese affairs in Cuba:</p>
<p>Reporting Duties in Beijing</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has been serving as the envoy to Cuba for more than a year. This time, he took leave to return to China on September 25, first taking a plane from Havana to Los Angeles in the United States. Then he took the President Coolidge of the Dollar Steamship Lines eastward to return home. According to Mr. Zhang's conversation with the reporter, he decided to take three months of leave. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he must also return to his hometown in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, to visit his relatives. Because his father has been suffering from madness, and the illness has become quite severe, he is anxious to take leave to return home. He decided to take the 11 o'clock express train to Beijing last night to pay respects to Foreign Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to report everything. Whether he will go to Hangzhou to see President Chiang Kai-shek will be decided after arriving in Beijing. After reporting to the government, he will still come to Shanghai to take a ship back to Guangdong Province to visit his relatives.</p>
<p>The Situation of Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang continued to talk about the situation of overseas Chinese in Cuba. According to statistics, there are about 30,000 overseas Chinese living in Cuba, most of whom are from Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces. They are engaged in small businesses such as groceries and laundry, as well as working for a living. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic downturn, the restrictions imposed by the local government, and the competition from local workers, it has become somewhat difficult to make a living, resulting in unemployed overseas Chinese. Fortunately, overseas Chinese there have organizations similar to hometown associations, which help each other. Accommodation is not a problem, so there are no wandering and destitute overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Establishing Education</p>
<p>Although the number of overseas Chinese there reaches more than 30,000, there has never been a school established by overseas Chinese, so that the overseas Chinese growing up in Cuba are completely ignorant of the Chinese language. When I first took office, in view of the concern that overseas Chinese children would be unable to attend school, I summoned powerful overseas Chinese there to establish a school. After seven or eight months of preparatory work, a "Chinese School" has now been established in Havana, the capital of Cuba, to accommodate as many overseas Chinese children as possible. The school opened on October 1 last year. In addition to the donations from overseas Chinese, the government also provides considerable subsidies. After this initial education has achieved results, it will be gradually promoted so that overseas Chinese education will not decline.</p>
<p>Cuban Politics</p>
<p>Regarding the diplomatic relations between China and Cuba, they have always been cordial. The governments and people of both countries treat each other with an extremely friendly attitude. Cuba is a country in South America, and all its political facilities mostly imitate the United States. In recent years, the political situation has been very stable. The main language is Spanish, and the main products are sugar and tobacco, which are sold to various South American countries. The total population of the country is more than 4 million, and there are more than 600,000 foreigners, with about 1,000 foreigners entering the country every day, all engaged in planting for a living.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers in Japanese Brewery Once Withdrew Yesterday; More Than Forty More Went There in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that the Japanese troops stationed in the Japanese brewery at the end of Huayuan Street, Zhabei, Shanghai, once withdrew yesterday morning. Then, at 2:00 p.m., more than 40 more Japanese troops went to garrison. The withdrawal situation yesterday morning began at 8:20 a.m. A total of 100 Japanese soldiers and military supplies were loaded into seven military vehicles and withdrawn along Jiangwan Road and Tongji Road to the Japanese military headquarters on North Sichuan Road. It was completed at about 9:30 a.m. When the reporter went to inspect, the army had all withdrawn. There was no trace of the Japanese army inside or outside the factory. Only the Japanese owner of the factory was inside arranging everything. The military supplies and all defense works, such as the watchtower, had been dismantled and taken away. Only a few useless sundries were left on the open space next to the factory. After the nearby residents learned of the withdrawal of the Japanese army, they went to watch in groups. The cowherds were already grazing cattle outside the factory. The area around the Japanese brewery, which had been regarded as a forbidden area for the past two weeks, was restored to its former state. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 p.m., a Japanese military vehicle carrying more than 40 armed Japanese soldiers, without military supplies, drove to garrison and set up posts around. They did not withdraw until late at night. The situation in the North Sichuan Road area was also slightly eased yesterday, but patrol teams still came and went endlessly and still crossed into the city.</p>

<h3>Silver Syndicate Handles Rice Mortgage; Method of Rice Merchant's Loan Decided; First Step to Handle Hunan Rice Mortgage to Begin Soon; Silver Syndicate Pays 80% of Price First When Rice is Shipped Out</h3>
<p>In order to regulate people's food and help rice merchants, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have specially joined Shanghai, Guohuo, Guohua, Yanye, Jincheng, Dalu, Zhongnan, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau to form a silver syndicate to handle domestic rice mortgage. The total amount of loans is tentatively set at 10 million yuan, which is shared equally by the participating banks. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will act as agents for foreign exchange mortgage matters. The Silver Syndicate Committee has been established and is located in the headquarters of the Bank of Communications. The first step is to handle the Hunan rice mortgage. All qualified domestic rice transported and sold to various places can apply for loans and mortgage exchange according to the Hunan rice sales to Guangdong method. The method stipulates that after the rice merchant's application is approved, the silver syndicate will first lend 80% of the mortgage price. After the rice is transported from the place of origin to a certain place for sale, the rice merchant will return the loan and pay a monthly interest of 7%. If the mortgage transportation period is one year, the annual interest of 8.4% will be paid. The Hunan rice sales to Guangdong has been discussed and decided by the Hunan and Guangdong provincial governments, and cooperation with the banking industry will be carried out. The Import and Export Inspection Committee of the Ministry of Industry will assist the construction departments of the two provinces in handling import and export inspection. The silver syndicate accepts mortgage applications and will review them based on the inspection results. After the Silver Syndicate Committee holds its second meeting within a few days to decide on various procedures, the loan will be started on a specified date.</p>
<h3>Kusumoto Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning; Negotiations Before Departure; Japanese Embassy Keeps Secrets</h3>
<p>Kusumoto, the chief of the Japanese Army Special Service Agency, who was entrusted with a special and important mission to meet with Commander Tashiro in Tianjin, returned to Shanghai by China National Aviation Corporation plane on the morning of the 17th after finishing his business in Beijing. He went to Wuding Road at about 6 p.m. that evening to meet with Kita Seiichi, the army attache, Sato, the naval attache, and Okouchi, the commander of the Third Fleet, to report on his trip to Tianjin. He also held an informal meeting to exchange views on the steps to be taken in the future. It is now heard that Kusumoto still needs to report to Kawagoe, so he took a car to Beijing at 8 a.m. yesterday (one said he flew to Beijing by China National Aviation Corporation plane) to meet with Suma, the Japanese consul in Beijing, and Utsunomiya, the army attache, to exchange views again, and provide them to Kawagoe for mediating Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Yesterday morning, the reporter of the Ta Kung Pao inquired about this matter to Hachiya Minoru, the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy, who was tight-lipped about the news of Kusumoto's return to Shanghai. This shows the importance of Kusumoto's mission, so his whereabouts are so secret.</p>
<h3>Four Japanese Warships Sailed to Beijing</h3>
<p>Thirty-three Foreign Ships Still in the Huangpu River According to the customs report, the No. 22 Japanese torpedo boat squadron of four ships, which were berthed at the Osaka Wharf on the Jiangmian and the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, suddenly sailed out of the Wusongkou between 3:25 p.m. and 4:00 p.m. yesterday and sailed to Nanjing to garrison. As of now, in addition to the five Japanese warships, there are 25 American warships and three French warships, a total of 33 ships, remaining in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Ships Report Accidents; Barge Blown Over by Hurricane</h3>
<p>Recently, the water level along the Changsha route has receded, only three feet one or two inches. The Shanghai Jianghai ships going to Hunan can only reach Lulin Tan or Jinggang, and then use shallow-water barges to transfer the goods to Hunan. The goods of the Sanbei Company in this port, which were transported from Shanghai to Changsha, were transferred in Jinggang. On the 17th of this month, the company's No. 2 barge, carrying Hunan goods, sailed to the river surface near Ehuashan, when a hurricane suddenly arose and the river waves were turbulent. The barge initially struggled against the wind and waves, but the wind became stronger and the waves became more turbulent. The barge was sunk near Ehuashan. Fortunately, the crew members who fell into the water were rescued because the water was shallow, but the goods in the ship were completely lost, including 50 bundles of white sugar and 50 bundles of pepper. Other goods can still be salvaged. Yesterday, a telegram from Changsha reported that the company had notified the customers in Shanghai who loaded the goods, and forwarded them to the insurance company. On the one hand, it ordered the Changsha branch to send workers to the port to salvage the barge as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Haiyun Crashes into Wharf</p>
<p>The Haiyun ship of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company came to Shanghai from Lianyungang and loaded a full ship of coal. After unloading at the Zhoujiazui Wharf in Pudong, the ship had to turn around as usual. Unexpectedly, when it turned around in front of the wharf yesterday, its stern suddenly crashed into the No. 2 Wharf of the Zhoujiazui Stack, causing the "small cargo wharf" (this wharf is specially used for unloading small batches of goods, hence the name) to be damaged considerably. The buildings on the wharf were damaged, and the engine blade at the stern of the Haiyun ship was also damaged. After the accident, both parties reported to the bureau. Yesterday, the bureau had sent engineers to the wharf and the ship to inspect the damage situation of both parties.</p>
<p>Changtai Dagukou Run Aground</p>
<p>The Changtai ship of the Minxin Shipping Company is currently sailing along the Beiyang route. The ship was carrying cargo this time and sailed to Dagukou. Due to the low water level in the Haihe River, and the Changtai ship had a draft of 16 feet 6 inches, it ran aground. Yesterday, Shanghai received a telegram from the captain of the ship, saying that the Changtai ship had run aground at Dagukou and had not been able to find a way to escape. Rescue is underway. The Shanghai company could not fully understand the details due to the brief telegram and has sent a telegram to inquire. The Tongcheng ship of the Tongcheng Company ran aground in Chenjiagang, Haizhou on the 18th. According to yesterday's telegram, it had managed to escape at high tide.</p>
<p>Haiyi Damaged Parts</p>
<p>The Haiyi ship of the Huashang Shipping Company in this port has a deadweight of 2,154 tons and a draft of 20 feet 2 inches. The ship is huge and was previously bought and sold with China Merchants and sailed to Nanhua. Now the ship has been rented by the Japanese Datong Company and is sailing to various ports along the coast of North China. Yesterday, the Shanghai company received a telegram from the owner of the Haiyi ship, saying that the parts of the ship suddenly broke down while it was sailing towards Qinhuangdao and it was unable to continue moving forward. It has now found a way to sail to Dalian for repairs. The telegram did not mention how it was damaged, nor did it detail the extent of the damage and the condition of the parts. The company has sent a telegram yesterday to inquire, asking the owner of the ship to quickly report clearly.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Sojourners in Shanghai Hosted a Banquet for Ren Ke-cheng Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ren Ke-cheng, the newly appointed Yunnan-Guizhou Supervisory Commissioner, came to Shanghai a few days ago to wait for a ship to go to Yunnan and Guizhou to take up his new post. Yunnan sojourners in Shanghai held a farewell banquet at the Xinya Restaurant at 5 p.m. yesterday. Zhang Kang-seng, manager of the Fudian Bank, Yang Jia-lin, Fang Guo-ding, and Yunnan students from Fudan University and Datia University were present. During the banquet, Yang Jia-lin delivered a speech, saying that Yunnan and Guizhou are located in remote border areas, with limited access to information. The need for supervision is more urgent than in the inland provinces. Mr. Ren was the ruler of Yunnan Province during the Yunnan Uprising and was the first to advocate the protection of the law, which has contributed to the party and the country. Now the central government has specially appointed him, which is fortunate. It is hoped that he will rectify the officialdom of Yunnan and Guizhou and relieve the suffering of the people. Mr. Ren replied, saying that he would do his best to fulfill the expectations of the people of Yunnan and Guizhou. Then, the guests and hosts exchanged toasts and dispersed after more than an hour.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu and Others Sent Representatives to Attend Hu's National Funeral</h3>
<p>The national funeral ceremony of Chairman Hu will be held in Guangdong on the 25th. Mayor Wu specially sent Wu Zixiang, director of the city treasury, as a representative to take the President Coolidge of the Ten Company to Hong Kong on the morning of the 19th and then to Guangdong to attend.</p>
<p>Yang Hu, the special commissioner of the Chinese Seamen's Party Department, specially sent Ma Bolin as a representative to take a ship yesterday to pay tribute, and brought a eulogy.</p>
<h3>Those Who Inject Morphine and Use Drugs are Limited to Self-Renovate and Surrender for Rehabilitation by the End of the Year, and are Allowed to be Exempted from Criminal Punishment; Those Who Fail to Do So Will be Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued an order yesterday to the county governments of Shanghai and other counties, stipulating that all those who inject morphine and use drugs must be limited to self-renovate and surrender for rehabilitation by the end of this year, and will be exempted from criminal punishment. The original order stated, "After the general inspection of drug offenders in this province, they should have been eliminated. If there are still those who are obsessed, they should be punished according to the law. However, Jiangsu Province is located in a key transportation hub with convenient transportation. Some may flee from one place to another and hide themselves. Others may be lost for a while and fall into depravity. Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Opium and Punishment of Crimes stipulates that those who commit the crimes stipulated in Articles 3 and 7 of this regulation from 1937 onwards shall be sentenced to death. From January 1, 1937, in addition to offenders who manufacture, transport, and sell drugs, who shall still be sentenced to death, other first-time offenders who inject morphine or use drugs, who were originally only sentenced to imprisonment, shall also be sentenced to death. It is not a pity that they knowingly commit crimes, but it is unbearable to see these ignorant people facing the death penalty. In order to show the intention of benevolence outside the law, a final opportunity for self-renovation is given. All first-time offenders who inject morphine and use drugs who self-renovate and surrender to the county government for rehabilitation before the end of this year will be exempted from criminal punishment and handed over to medical treatment for rehabilitation. In addition to separate orders, the county magistrate is ordered to comply, and to widely publicize and inform the local anti-smoking committee and local authorities. The county magistrate must report the situation from time to time."</p>
<h3>Xue Guangqian Talks about the Personnel System of Railways in Various Countries; Strict Performance Evaluation, Clear Rewards and Punishments, Layoffs and Salary Increases, and Increased Efficiency</h3>
<p>Dr. Xue Guangqian, the current commissioner of the Ministry of Railways, was ordered by Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways to visit Austria, Germany, Belgium, Britain, France, Switzerland, and Italy to study the personnel system of railways before returning to China. Yesterday, Mr. Xue came to Shanghai on official business. The reporter specially visited him to inquire about the personnel system of railways in various countries. He gave the following general overview:</p>
<p>The length of railway lines and the number of employees in various countries vary due to differences in population and area. However, the average number of employees hired per kilometer is the lowest in Italy, averaging no more than ten people, and the highest in Britain, about sixteen people or more. This is because after Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922, he laid off a large number of redundant employees and redundant agencies in the national railways, creating a new look. The British railway industry is not state-owned, but is operated separately by four major private railway companies, which leads to the separation of powers and uneconomical use of personnel. This is due to differences in history, organization, and system, so it is not possible to strongly distinguish between advantages and disadvantages. The most noteworthy aspect of the personnel system of railways in various countries is that not only are the job titles and salary levels of all railway employees unified, but also the number of internal and external employees of each railway is limited to a certain extent, so that the distribution of personnel and the needs of affairs do not lose their balance. In addition to the special selection by the highest authorities of the Ministry of Railways, new employees must go through examination procedures. After passing the examination, they must also undergo</p>
<p>Strict training and be managed by the Ministry of Railways, so that the talents recruited meet the actual requirements. As for the original personnel, performance evaluations are held once or twice a year, which are extremely strict. The reward methods for performance evaluation are generally two types: promotion and grade increase. Grade increase is a fixed salary increase, with a grade increase every year or several years, and a certain salary increase. In addition to passing the examination, promotion must also wait for opportunities. If the railway industry does not develop and there is no possibility of incremental positions, it is difficult to obtain a vacancy for promotion. Therefore, railway personnel are closely related to the railway industry, and everyone takes the development of the railway industry as a prerequisite, because personal promotion is entirely dependent on the rise and fall of the industry. In addition to stopping grade increases or salary reductions, those who do not work hard may be subject to dismissal. Therefore, rewards and punishments are clear, and if rewards and punishments are clear, everything will be done. The railways of Italy have been plagued by many problems in the past, which is known to the world. However, after Mussolini's</p>
<p>Innovation and Reorganization, it has gradually become the norm. Today, it has become one of the countries with the fastest development and the most complete equipment in the railway industry. Before Mussolini came to power, the railways were filled with redundant employees and redundant agencies, and the road administration was corrupt. At the most, the state subsidized the railways with as much as 600 million lire per year. When Mussolini came to power, he carried out major reforms, laying off employees and increasing salaries, so that the fewest people could obtain sufficient living wages. As a result, efficiency increased and results were immediately visible. Within a few years, on the one hand, the state subsidy was reduced to 300 million lire, and on the other hand, the length of the lines was extended, the number of trains increased, and the number of vehicles, locomotives, and stations increased significantly. The laid-off employees were covered by social insurance provided by the state, and the social insurance funds were invested in rural reclamation. That is, this group of laid-off personnel was absorbed into the rural areas. Therefore, when talking about the way to reform politics, unilateral efforts cannot take effect. It is necessary to innovate in many ways and</p>
<p>Collaborate to achieve a common result from the separate efforts of each day. The railway industry is not only a means of transportation, but also a hub of education, culture, industry, and economy in a country. It must be promoted in many ways, and then generate each other to achieve twice the result with half the effort and division of labor and cooperation. The railways of various countries have strict and fair regulations for employee leave rules, travel methods, pension and retirement systems, and various employee welfare programs, which can be used as a reference for the people of our country. I have already prepared a report of more than 10,000 words and presented it to Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways, as a reference for our country's reform and revitalization.</p>
<h3>Chen Ticheng, Director of the Fujian Construction Department, Went to Beijing in the Evening; Chongxi People Hosted a Banquet to Welcome Him</h3>
<p>Chen Ticheng, director of the Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government, has spared no effort in carrying out various constructions in Fujian Province in recent years. Taking highways as an example, its development is truly progressing by leaps and bounds. He has been very resolute and painstaking in improving various existing industries in Fujian Province, such as tea, fruits, sugarcane, ceramics, etc., and has achieved remarkable results. He recently arrived in Shanghai from Fujian on official business. The night before last, he took the 11 o'clock express train to Beijing. It is said that he will return to Shanghai and then to Fujian within about a week. The Fujian Xinyongding Construction Association in this port specially hosted a banquet at Yizhixiang, Sima Road, at 8 p.m. that evening (the 18th) to welcome him. Those present included Director Chen, Su Lezhen, the president of the association, Hu Guigeng, the general manager of the association, Jiang Wenxin, Su Jishi, Lai Zhenhuan, Lu Gongheng, Lu Yunwu, Jiang Buyun, Lin Zuomei, and dozens of others. First, Su Lezhen, the president of the association, delivered a speech, saying that the association had previously submitted a report to the Construction Department due to the failure of the Yongding tobacco industry, requesting that personnel be sent to Yongding to establish a field and test the improvement in order to save it. Director Chen had approved it and allocated 10,000 yuan in public bonds for the project, which shows that Director Chen has been doing his best for local construction, which is truly grateful. He should thank Director Chen tonight. Chen replied that the department had originally planned to improve Yongding tobacco leaves, but had not implemented it due to insufficient funding. Now that the department has approved the allocation of 10,000 yuan in public bonds for the project, but there are very few experts in improving tobacco leaves in China. He is planning to find them in the Philippines so that it can be implemented as soon as possible. It is best that local talents from the county can be selected and sent abroad to study, and then return to the county to serve when they graduate. He praised the association's plan to establish the Yongding Bank and encouraged them to work hard. After the speeches, the guests and hosts exchanged toasts and enjoyed themselves until half past ten before dispersing.</p>

<h3>Pan Xulun, Li Wenjie, et al. Petition to Amend the Bankruptcy Law; Request the Judicial Yuan and Ministry to Create a Small Bankruptcy System and Clearly Define the Circumstances for Litigation Assistance</h3>
<p>The implementation of our country's bankruptcy law has exceeded one year. General bankruptcy cases, due to the limited scope of the estate, are simple and narrow. Yet, they must go through the complex procedures stipulated by the bankruptcy law. In reality, many difficulties often arise, sometimes making the bankruptcy proceedings impossible to continue. Accountants Pan Xulun, Qian Nai Cheng, Li Wenjie, Li Hongshou, and others of this city, noting that various countries have established small bankruptcy systems, such as when the assets of a bankruptcy estate are below a certain amount, procedures like publishing announcements in newspapers are omitted, auditors are not appointed, and court rulings replace resolutions of creditors' meetings. Distributions are limited to one-time payouts. All of these measures are designed to save estate costs and expedite the closing of proceedings. They believe that it is indeed necessary for our country to follow suit. Therefore, they jointly petitioned the Ministry of Justice, requesting an amendment to the bankruptcy law to add a chapter on simplified bankruptcy procedures. The original petition is recorded below:</p>
<p>Submitting a request to forward to the Judicial Yuan and consult with the Legislative Yuan to amend the bankruptcy law and add a chapter on simplified bankruptcy procedures to suit national conditions and facilitate commercial and civil affairs.</p>
<p>We have reviewed the national bankruptcy law, which has been in effect since October 1, 1935, for over a year. Chambers of commerce and courts in various regions have achieved effective results in handling conciliation and bankruptcy cases. We have been selected by the courts in this city to serve as supervisors and assistants in conciliation cases and as bankruptcy administrators in bankruptcy cases. Based on past case-handling experience, we deeply feel that there are many points in our country's bankruptcy law that need to be supplemented or amended. The lack of provisions for simplified bankruptcy procedures is particularly inconvenient. We will first list this point to your department.</p>
<p>We have reviewed that the scale of industry and commerce in our country is generally small, and the private economic situation is mostly poor. The amounts of debts and credits are also generally minor. In recent years, influenced externally by the social recession and internally by unsound organization and improper management, bankruptcy petitions have poured in, overwhelming the courts. Observing the organization of bankruptcy estates, they are mostly incomplete and weak. However, the procedures stipulated by the bankruptcy law must be followed in their entirety. Precisely because of their complexity, creditors' meetings are difficult to convene, auditors cannot be appointed, the management and distribution of the bankruptcy estate cannot proceed, and the bankruptcy administrator is at a loss, ultimately leading to a de facto termination of the bankruptcy proceedings. The development of this phenomenon will cause both the bankrupt and the creditors to suffer losses, greatly deviating from the original intention of the state in formulating bankruptcy laws.</p>
<p>After thoroughly investigating the crux of the problem, it is due to the absence of simplified bankruptcy procedures in the bankruptcy law. Regardless of the amount of property belonging to the bankruptcy estate, all bankruptcy cases are forced to comply with complex procedures. For example, the bankruptcy administrator advances funds to publish announcements in newspapers, but the assets of the bankruptcy estate are insufficient to cover the costs of the estate, resulting in no recovery. Attendees at creditors' meetings repeatedly fall short of the statutory requirements for resolutions, leading to the inability to select auditors. Such examples are too numerous to list.</p>
<p>We believe that to remedy the aforementioned malpractices, the legal intent of setting up simplified procedures in civil and criminal procedure laws should be adopted. A distinction should be made between bankruptcy estates with property valued above a certain amount, which should follow normal bankruptcy procedures, and those below a certain amount, which should be treated as simplified bankruptcy cases with separate simplified procedures. This would aim to save estate costs and expedite the closing of proceedings.</p>
<p>Consider Articles 358 to 366 of the Japanese Bankruptcy Law, which establish small bankruptcy procedures for bankruptcy cases with estate property below 10,000 yuan. The main points are summarized as follows: auditors are not appointed; announcements in newspapers are not required; except for the first creditors' meeting, court rulings replace resolutions of creditors' meetings; distribution is limited to one-time payout. All of these aspects seem to be worth adopting.</p>
<p>Therefore, we specially petition your department to consider the actual situation of bankruptcy cases handled by courts in various regions over the past year and the unavoidable legal difficulties encountered. We request that you promptly forward this petition to the Judicial Yuan and consult with the Legislative Yuan to amend the current bankruptcy law, adding a chapter on simplified bankruptcy procedures to benefit merchants and the public. This would be extremely beneficial.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the bankruptcy administrator's actions during bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of the bankruptcy estate, such as initiating lawsuits, responding to lawsuits, and appealing, are often numerous. In reality, the existing property of the bankruptcy estate is often very limited. The bankruptcy administrator often has difficulty in covering the costs of appeals and litigation at the time. If a request for litigation assistance is made, it is often rejected, and even if approved, it takes a long time. As a result, the administrator is often negligent in pursuing or defending lawsuits, leaving the rights and obligations of the bankruptcy estate unprotected. It should be clearly stipulated in the bankruptcy law the circumstances under which litigation assistance is granted to provide relief.</p>
<p>We also earnestly request that you consider and forward to the Judicial Yuan and consult with the Legislative Yuan to add and implement this provision.</p>
<p>Submitted with utmost anticipation,</p>
<p>Respectfully presented to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Justice.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies Requests Introduction of Domestic Goods for Sale</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in the Dutch East Indies, in order to introduce domestic goods for sale in the Dutch East Indies, has sent a letter to various domestic goods organizations in this city requesting assistance. The original letter states:</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies government implemented regulations restricting the import of foreign goods in 1934. Our chamber also convened various import merchants in the Dutch East Indies in the same year to jointly organize and petition the Dutch East Indies government for protection. Many of the requested matters have been approved, and the members have also gained considerable benefits. The chamber's affairs are progressing with increasing trust, and it is indeed a healthy group of Chinese merchants involved in importing goods in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>The recent visit of a Nanyang inspection delegation organized by various manufacturers' organizations in Shanghai, bringing products from various factories for exhibition in Batavia, has received much praise from people here. Our chamber has done its best to introduce them. Various import merchants in Batavia have ordered domestic goods, and although the quantity is not large, it is no less than that of other ports. Among them, it is more difficult to import domestic goods that are on the restricted list into the Dutch East Indies. Our chamber has been working hard to negotiate with the Import Bureau of the Dutch East Indies Department of Economic Affairs. Except for goods that conflict with Dutch East Indies industrial products, the rest will be approved if possible. This is not only the duty of our chamber but also helps to open up channels for exporting domestic goods.</p>
<p>We have long admired your association's leadership of domestic goods manufacturers in their efforts to revitalize industry. We are writing to request that you instruct various manufacturers to send sample specimens so that we can do our best to introduce them.</p>
<h3>Salt Inspectorate Plans to Implement New Salt Law, Deciding to Start with Sichuan and Guangdong and Implement Gradually by District System</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, in order to reform the national salt administration, has implemented the New Salt Law and has ordered the Salt Inspectorate to be responsible for preparations. The Inspectorate believes that the national salt regions are vast, and the New Salt Law must be implemented gradually by region according to the district system of the salt administration organs. After consulting with the Ministry of Finance, it was decided to begin preparations by district. Considering that the salt administration in Guangdong and Sichuan urgently needs reform and rectification, it was decided to implement the New Salt Law first in the two regions of Guangdong and Sichuan during this period of abolishing the old salt law. The Inspectorate is currently planning and preparing to start on New Year's Day next year, and then the implementation will be decided by salt region.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Issued Order Yesterday to Inspect Meat Cattle; Severe Punishment Will Be Imposed on Those Who Sell and Slaughter Farm Cattle</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued an order to various business tax bureaus and offices yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>The sale and slaughter of farm cattle that are essential for plowing farmland has always been absolutely prohibited. Only those that are truly old and incapable of plowing are allowed to be used as meat cattle. Orders have been repeatedly issued to strictly implement the Provisional Regulations on Prohibiting the Sale and Slaughter of Farm Cattle and the Implementing Rules. Inspection agencies should strictly inspect those who transport them out of the province and monitor those who slaughter them locally at all times. Meat cattle that have not been inspected and qualified shall not be privately transported into the province or privately slaughtered. If cattle dealers or slaughterhouses privately sell or slaughter farm cattle, they shall be punished in accordance with the regulations and their operations shall be suspended. If the bureau chief fails to comply with the regulations, is negligent in inspection, and allows the private sale and slaughter of farm cattle, resulting in cattle shortages, they will be severely punished upon discovery or accusation to serve as a warning to those who neglect their duties. In addition to ordering the various bureaus and offices, it is hereby urgently ordered that the bureau chief comply and pay special attention.</p>
<h3>The Fall of a Literary Giant</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>"There must be such a warrior!</p>
<p>"He is no longer ignorant like an African native carrying a shiny Mauser rifle; nor is he tired, like a Chinese Green Standard soldier carrying a box cannon. He does not beg for the armor of cowhide and iron; he has only himself, but he carries the throwing spear used by barbarians. He walks into a field of nothingness, and everything he meets nods to him in the same way. He knows that this nod is the enemy's weapon, a weapon that kills without bloodshed. Many warriors have perished here, just like artillery shells, rendering brave men powerless.</p>
<p>"Those heads each have a battle flag, embroidered with various names: benevolent officials, scholars, literary men, elders, young elegant men, gentlemen... Below the heads are various coats, embroidered with all kinds of beautiful patterns: learning, morality, national essence, public opinion, logic, justice, Eastern civilization.</p>
<p>"But he raised the throwing spear.</p>
<p>"He smiled, threw it sideways, and hit them right in the heart.</p>
<p>"Everything seemed to fall to the ground—but there was only a coat, with nothing inside. The thing of nothingness had already left, having won the victory, because he had now become a criminal who harmed philanthropists and the like.</p>
<p>"But he raised the throwing spear.</p>
<p>"…</p>
<p>"He finally grew old and weak in nothingness and died. He was finally not a warrior, but the thing of nothingness was the victor…</p>
<p>"But he raised the throwing spear—"</p>
<p>—Lu Xun: "Such a Warrior"</p>
<p>Such a stubborn and brave warrior! He hated darkness, detested gentlemen, the vile and cowardly children of "Old China," and the ignorant and brutal rulers... He used an incredibly sarcastic pen to expose and attack them without compromise or timidity. He was regarded as a rebel and reactionary by traditional society, but he was respected and loved by countless young people and righteous people.</p>
<p>Such a warrior—our literary giant Mr. Lu Xun, fought all his life amidst numerous overt and covert attacks, against all feudal and dark forces. Although his spirit had not aged at all, he finally quietly left this world yesterday (October 19, 1936) at five o'clock in the morning.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>When I received the news of Mr. Lu Xun's death at around eleven o'clock, I felt a chill run straight from the top of my head to my toes. I was in a daze for a while, feeling extremely empty inside.</p>
<p>The death of such a warrior is an immeasurable loss for China!—In the short history of China's New Culture Movement, what a bright and splendid page Mr. Lu Xun has written!</p>
<p>Around one o'clock in the afternoon, I and several companions hurriedly rushed to Mr. Lu's residence in ×× Village on North Sichuan Road. There was no sound of crying, only a solemn silence and sorrow. Mrs. Lu Xun (Ms. Xu Guangping)'s eyes were somewhat red and swollen, and several young men and women were silently eating lunch. Among these people were Mr. Lu's third younger brother, Zhou Jianren, the editor of "Translation," Huang Yuan, and the young writer Tian Jun, among others.</p>
<p>Led by Mr. Huang Yuan, we went to Mr. Lu's bedroom on the second floor. The room was not large, and Mr. Lu's body lay peacefully on a bed on the left, covered with a pink cotton quilt. A white gauze cloth covered his face. Mr. Huang Yuan lifted the white cloth, and his eyes turned red. Mr. Lu's mouth and eyes were tightly closed. His black hair, with a few strands of silver, his thick eyebrows and beard, and his face, though a little thin, did not look too bad.</p>
<p>Everyone was silent, holding their breath. I felt a heavy oppression in my heart.</p>
<p>Next to the head of the bed, near the window, was a half-old desk, piled with books and manuscripts. Two "Golden Unchanging" writing brushes stood upright in the pen holder. Next to it was a covered porcelain tea cup. This was the place where Mr. Lu had spent so much effort and energy in his life. Now it looked very cluttered. At the end of the desk was the rattan recliner that Mr. Lu had mentioned in his recent article. Leaning against it was a square table, filled with books. There were small bookshelves at the head and foot of the bed. Some woodcuts and oil paintings hung on the walls. One seemed to be a print by Ms. Käthe Kollwitz, and another was an oil painting of a baby, with the words "Sixteen Months After Sea Eagle's Birth" written on it.—Sea Eagle is Mr. Lu Xun's only beloved son, who is only eight or nine years old this year. This innocent child did not seem to understand the worries of life at all and was jumping and bouncing happily.</p>
<p>Looking at these things, I couldn't help but feel deeply moved. This old warrior, our generation's literary giant, has now left us forever!</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Xun was from Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, originally named Zhou Shuren. He was born in 1881 and died at the age of 56.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Mr. Lu had been very ill. It is said that he suffered from lung disease and inflammation of the diaphragm. A serious illness this summer had worried countless people who cared about Mr. Lu's health for a while, but he eventually gradually recovered. However, his health had not fully recovered.</p>
<p>Many people had advised him to leave Shanghai and go to Japan or another part of China to recuperate, but he refused. When his spirit recovered slightly, he continued his work of reading and writing. "Since last year, whenever I rested after illness, lying on the rattan recliner, I couldn't help but think about what I should do after my strength recovered: what articles to write, what books to translate or print. After thinking and deciding, I would end it with 'That's how it should be—but I have to hurry up and do it.' This thought of 'having to hurry up and do it' was not there before because I unconsciously remembered my age." (Lu Xun: "Death," see "Zhongliu" second issue.)—For the sake of cultural work, Mr. Lu Xun was coping with his limited life in this way!</p>
<p>It is said that Mr. Lu's body and spirit had been very good recently, and Mr. Lu's wife and several close friends were very happy. Not long ago, Mr. Lu also excitedly went to participate in the National Woodcut Exhibition held in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Last Saturday (October 17), Mr. Lu went to North Sichuan Road for a trip and caught a slight cold, but his spirit was still very good. When Mr. Zhou Jianren left Mr. Lu's residence at eleven o'clock in the evening, he was still very cheerful. But at two o'clock, he suddenly fell ill. The symptoms were not very peculiar, only that he was breathing very hard.</p>
<p>He saw a doctor, but it was ineffective, and he finally passed away yesterday morning at five o'clock. He died very peacefully, without leaving any words to his family.—His "will" had been mentioned in his recent work "Death."</p>
<p>Mrs. Lu Xun decided to follow the intentions of that will in handling his funeral.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Around two o'clock in the afternoon, the Star Film Company received the news of Mr. Lu's death and, guided by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, Cheng Bugao, and Yao Shennong, went to Mr. Lu's residence to take newsreel footage.</p>
<p>The film company shot footage of Mr. Lu's body and his residence, including his desk where he worked, arranged by Mrs. Lu Xun as he used to keep it.</p>
<p>Soon, many of Mr. Lu's friends arrived one after another to pay their respects to his remains. Among these people were many famous writers we know, such as Xia Mianzun, Ba Jin, Zhao Jiabi, Meng Shiyi, and others.</p>
<p>At about three o'clock, the car from the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road arrived, and several people carried Mr. Lu's body downstairs wrapped in white cloth. Many people followed behind in silence and sorrow. Mr. Tian Jun, this strong young man, initially lowered his head and wept, and finally cried out loud.</p>
<p>The time for the encoffining is scheduled for tonight. Mr. Lu Xun's body will be on public display at the International Funeral Home from nine o'clock this morning to five o'clock this afternoon, for all those who respect him to pay their respects to his remains.</p>
<p>The funeral committee has been organized, and those participating include Soong Ching Ling, Cai Yuanpei, Mao Dun, Cao Jinghua, Agnes Smedley, and Mr. Lu's two younger brothers, Zhou Zuoren and Zhou Jianren.</p>
<p>The cultural community has not yet decided on what memorial events to hold in honor of Mr. Lu's death. But for such a warrior in the cultural community, a literary giant of China, there should be some expression, even though this may not be what Mr. Lu Xun would have wanted.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>I do not want, and in fact cannot, use a worn-out pen to record anything about Mr. Lu Xun's progressive ideas on the Chinese youth, as well as the contribution of his works to the cultural community. His accomplishments will always shine brightly in history, and his outstanding personality will also be a permanent model for all revolutionaries.</p>
<p>Regarding the catalog of Mr. Lu Xun's works and translations, I have written it below based on very limited materials. The time is too rushed, and omissions are inevitable, so I can only correct it later when there is an opportunity. A. Works—Call to Arms, Wandering, Dawn Blossoms Plucked at Dusk, Old Tales Retold, Wild Grass, Hot Wind, The Grave, Huagai Collection, Huagai Collection Sequel, False Freedom, Two Hearts, Three Leisure Collections, That's It Collection, Two Places, Southern Accent and Northern Tone, Quasi-Wind and Moon, Fringed Literature, A Brief History of Chinese Fiction (two volumes), Excerpts of Old News on Fiction, Tang and Song Legendary Collections (ten volumes, compiled and corrected), Selected Works of Lu Xun, Supplementary Collection.</p>
<p>B. Translations—The Workers' Su Hui Luefu, A Young Man's Dream, Ero Shenke Fairy Tale Collection, Peach-Colored Clouds, A Symbol of Anguish, Out of the Ivory Tower, Little John, Thoughts on Landscape Figures, The Wall's Translation, Trends in Modern Art Thought, Lu Gu Hong Er's Picture Selection, The Theory and Practice of Proletarian Literature, On Art (by Lunacharsky), On Art (by Plekhanov), Literature and Criticism, Literary Policy, October, Medicinal Snacks, Destruction, Watch, Dead Souls, Harp, One Day's Work, Gorky's Truth, Bad Children and Other Strange News.</p>
<p>As for a part of Mr. Lu Xun's published but uncollected translations, as well as some unfinished drafts, we will probably know after they are sorted out.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Has Not Completely Abolished the Purser System on All Ships</h3>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reports: Yesterday's newspaper reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to abolish the purser position on all Jianghai ships starting next month. A reporter inquired with the company, and the responsible person made a statement, saying that the company added four new ships some years ago, sailing to Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Shantou. At that time, the position of purser was not established. The method, in addition to the cargo handling part being directly under the jurisdiction of the captain, was to set up a general affairs officer to manage the affairs on board, according to the captain's orders. Since its implementation, the business income of the Jianglun ships has also been better since the abolition of the comprador system in April of this year, which was changed to the purser system. Recently, in order to thoroughly reorganize the Jianglun ships, the company sent an inspection team to the ships to conduct on-site investigations. The team was composed of staff from the relevant departments and the new transportation instructor. After more than two months, the inspection of the Jianglun ships was completed. The company reported that some of the pursers on the ships were incompetent or had weak abilities, so they were replaced slightly. At the same time, the new sea ship system was imitated, and the position was abolished. As for the pursers on the remaining ships, if they can work hard, abide by the company's orders, and thoroughly reorganize, the company will still maintain the original system of pursers and will not change it lightly. The report that the company's board of directors decided and submitted to the Ministry of Communications to abolish the purser position on all Jianghai ships is not true.</p>

<h3>Saint Mary's Road: Detailed Account of a Bloody Case - A Treacherous Plot to Seize Wife and Property; Chi Wenxiang Nearly Suffered an Untimely Death Due to Deception</h3>
<p>At 11 PM on the 14th of last month, a murder case occurred in the loft of No. 38 Tongkang Lane, Saint Mary's Road, French Concession. Fortunately, the victim, with great strength, resisted and cried for help, thus avoiding harm. The assailant, in a panic, fled. With the help of residents in the lane and the police, an accomplice, Xu Yongcai from Pudong, was apprehended and taken to the police station for detention. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment. The next day, the police escorted Xu to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Here is a supplementary record of the case:</p>
<p>The Beginning and End of the Incident</p>
<p>The victim, Chi Wenxiang, also known as Heng Wenxiu, is 29 years old and from Pudong. He married into the Chi family, owners of the Fachang Paint Shop on Gordon Road in the Public Concession, hence the change of surname to Chi. His wife, Chi Wenying, is 27 years old and lives with her husband at No. 7 Ren'en Lane, Baker Road, also running a paint business. Because the Chi family owned real estate, their life was comfortable. Wenxiang's wife had an affair. This tragedy was caused by her lover's plot to seize another man's wife and usurp his property. Chi Wenxiang had a cousin, Xia Boling, who lived at No. 12 Le'an Lane, Avenue Joffre, and</p>
<p>ran a business</p>
<p>at No. 144 Route Beattie. He did not have frequent contact with Wenxiang. On the morning of the 5th of last month, Xia suddenly came to the Chi's house and told Chi's wife, Chi Wenying, that the family of Tang Chang'an, the district chief at the Caojia Road intersection in Pudong, needed to paint their house, and he was there to introduce the business. They agreed to go to the Tang's house with Tang's nephew, Xu Jinfu, the day after (the 6th) to discuss the matter in Pudong. The next morning, Xia and Xu accompanied Chi Wenxiang to Pudong. While walking, as it got late, they suddenly encountered a plainclothes member of the security corps who tried</p>
<p>to make a move midway</p>
<p>to kill Chi. Chi sensed that their appearance was not right. That night, they went to Xia's house and stayed overnight. The next morning, Xia said to Chi, "It's late; Tang may have gone to Shanghai. We will notify you for negotiation after we return to Shanghai." So they returned to Shanghai together. At noon on the 14th of last month, Chi Wenxiang received a phone call from Xu Jinfu saying that his uncle, Tang Chang'an, had arrived in Shanghai and rented</p>
<p>a loft</p>
<p>at No. 28 Tongkang Lane, opposite the Great World. Since Tang was out shopping, they would meet Tang later. Chi then arranged to wait at the Shenqu Theater in the Great World at 6 PM that afternoon. At 6 PM, Xia Boling and Xu Jinfu came to the Great World to meet Chi Wenxiang, and then said that Tang was already waiting in Tongkang Lane. So the three of them left the Great World and went to No. 28 Tongkang Lane. Xia Boling said he had other important matters to attend to and left. Chi and Xu Jinfu walked to the loft at No. 38 Tongkang Lane, where they saw</p>
<p>a villager-looking man</p>
<p>Xu Yongcai, also known as (Xu Yinquan, 23 years old, from Pudong). He was Xu Jinfu's cousin. There was only one wooden board and a large camphor chest in the room, nothing else. They waited until 10 PM, but Tang Chang'an still had not arrived. Xu Jinfu then ordered Chi Wenxiang to sleep there while they waited. So Xu Yongcai closed the door and turned off the lights. The three of them lay down on the wooden board. Before long, Chi Wenxiang drowsed off. The two Xus then took kitchen knives and attacked Chi while he was asleep. Chi felt pain in his sleep and got up in the dark to</p>
<p>resist with all his might</p>
<p>The assailants handed the murder weapon to Chi in the dark. Chi opened the window and threw it out, and loudly shouted for help. The assailants Xu Jinfu and Xu Yongcai panicked and ran out of the door. Chi was covered in blood and, injured, went downstairs and told the landlord Tang Dongsheng about the attack. The accomplice Xu Yongcai was seen fleeing by Cai Jincai, a resident of No. 28 Tongkang Lane. He chased him to the Jiuxing Theater on Foch Road, where he caught Xu Yongcai and handed him over to Chinese Constable No. 801, who took him to the scene of the incident in Tongkang Lane. A phone call was made to the French police station, who</p>
<p>summoned an ambulance</p>
<p>to send the injured Chi Wenxiang to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The assailant was brought to the police station and sent to court for interrogation. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Gu Shouxi, the attorney of the police department, stated that the investigation of the case had been completed. Because the victim's wife had an affair, after adultery, the suspect intended to seize the wife and usurp the property and committed attempted murder. Xu Yongcai is now being prosecuted for attempted murder. Then, the victim Chi Wenxiang complained about his experience. Xu Yongcai was interrogated and confessed that he was invited by Xu Jinfu, who is on the run. "I did not do it," he stated. The court reviewed the statements and, due to the complexity of the case, decided to adjourn the trial to the 27th and ordered the investigating detective Wu Wengang to summon all relevant witnesses for interrogation next time.</p>
<h3>Escort Agencies: Morally Corrupt - City Federation Petitions for Crackdown - Social Affairs Bureau Is Planning Measures</h3>
<p>Escort agencies are quite developed in Europe and America and are originally good organizations serving the public and guiding people. They have only been established in China in recent years. Initially, their purpose was still pure, but today, they have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Only a small number are truly for the purpose of guiding tourists. There are many names and the quality is uneven. Those who operate improperly under the guise of escort agencies are everywhere. According to a recent survey, there are more than 100 such organizations in this city. Because their service purpose is impure, their impact on society and people's minds is quite significant. The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city has petitioned the municipal government to severely crack down on them. Since taking office, Pan Gongzhan, the Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, has paid great attention to this issue and has ordered the bureau's public welfare and social education divisions to properly formulate disposal measures. Those who truly aim to guide tourists should be allowed to exist; otherwise, they should all be prohibited. The disposal measures are currently being drafted and will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Sale of a Young Girl Exposed - A Group of People Taken to the Bureau for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The young girl, Zhang Xiuying, is 25 years old. She lost her parents at a young age and has forgotten her place of origin. She was raised by her stepfather until she was eight or nine years old, when she was sold to Xiao as a servant. A year or two later, unable to bear the abuse, she escaped and became destitute. She met Li Mingshan, a Tianjin native who was acting as a police chief in the Public Security Bureau, who took her home to take care of his children. It has been ten years since then. Recently, Li was dismissed by his superiors and, due to financial difficulties, transferred her to the home of Zhu Chuyang, a Hunan native living on Wufu Road in Pudong, as a maid. After only a month, Li suddenly changed his name to Li Fengyi and colluded with Liu Jinfu, a Tianjin native, who changed his name to Zhang Jinfu, posing as Xiuying's brother, to sell Xiuying to Zhu as a concubine. At 9 PM the night before, they agreed on a price of 200 yuan. Just as they were writing a cohabitation agreement and about to complete the transaction, a police officer on duty at the Beihutang Road Police Station discovered it. He said that the sale of people was prohibited by law and immediately brought Li Mingshan, Liu Jinfu, Zhu Chuyang, and Zhang Xiuying, along with the agreement, to the Pudong branch bureau for investigation. First, Zhang Xiuying testified about being sold. Then, Liu Jinfu pushed the blame onto Li Mingshan. Zhu Chuyang confessed that because his wife could not have children, he planned to take Xiuying as a concubine to have descendants. Director Zhang of the branch bureau, seeing that Xiuying's life was drifting and her situation was pitiful, and that she was not fully developed, found that the defendants' actions were inhumane and ordered that the group of people be taken to the main bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Secret Report of Selling Poisonous Drugs - Search Yields Nothing - Deer Fetus Brandy and Guanyin Ten-Drop Water - Previously Sold, But Now Long Discontinued - Jiang Zhang Held Temporarily for Investigation</h3>
<p>Jiang Quesheng, from Jiangsu, previously founded the Shanghai Family Hygiene Society on Guling Road, producing Deer Fetus Brandy and Guanyin Relief Ten-Drop Water. After Jiang's death, the Shanghai Family Hygiene Society was taken over by his brother, Jiang Qudan, and moved to No. 18, Lane 434, Baker Road, to continue operations. The Municipal Public Security Bureau previously received a secret report stating that the Deer Fetus Brandy and Guanyin Relief Ten-Drop Water sold by the society contained morphine and other poisonous substances. Therefore, on June 8 of this year, they sent a letter to the First Special Court, requesting</p>
<p>assistance in the investigation</p>
<p>and stating that Baohua Pharmacy at No. 556 Guangdong Road also had Deer Fetus Brandy for sale in its catalog and should be investigated as well. The Special Court then consulted the Laoza and Xinza police stations of the Public Works Department and ordered detectives to first investigate the Shanghai Family Hygiene Society at No. 18, Lane 434, Baker Road. It was confirmed that they had sold the drug, but it was found that the owner of the society, Jiang Qudan, had died in 1931. After Jiang Qudan's death, the society stopped operating, all the drugs were shipped to Jiangbei, and the sign had been removed. Because the police found no evidence, they then went to</p>
<p>Baohua Pharmacy</p>
<p>to investigate. Detective No. 47 pretended to be a customer and asked the pharmacy to buy Deer Fetus Brandy. According to the staff, the drug had long been discontinued, and the current product catalog had also been changed. The detectives also had no evidence, so they reported back to the police station. On July 29, they sent a letter to the First Special Court, which was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, Wu Zhenkang, a relative of Jiang Qudan (a member of the Suzhou Anti-Drug Association), recently reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau that Jiang Xiangwu, the son of Jiang Qudan, was still selling the previous</p>
<p>poisonous</p>
<p>drugs at No. 15 Chengyu Lane, No. 45 Qingdao Road. On September 12, Wu Hui, together with Chen Youde, an investigator from the Fourth Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, went to No. 15 Chengyu Lane, Qingdao Road, and bought four bottles of Deer Fetus Brandy and one bottle of Guanyin Relief Ten-Drop Water, totaling eight yuan, from Jiang Zhang, Jiang Qudan's concubine from Hangzhou. They took them back to the Public Security Bureau and sent them to Jiangsu Provincial Hospital and the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau for testing. It was confirmed that they contained the poisonous substance morphine. Therefore, they requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. At 12:30 PM the day before yesterday, they, together with</p>
<p>the Xinza Police Station</p>
<p>and drug detective Yang Yunfeng, went to No. 15 Yongyu Lane, Qingdao Road, for a search, but found nothing. They only found more than a hundred empty bottles on the drying platform. They then took Jiang Zhang to the police station and transferred her to the women's detention center. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Wang Yaotang, the attorney of the police station, rose and explained the above situation, stating that the empty bottles seized from the defendant's residence the day before were covered with dust, indicating that they had been placed there for a long time and had not been used. The Engineering Bureau stated that the evidence presented by the Municipal Public Security Bureau was insufficient and that the informant Wu Zhenkang was suspected of</p>
<p>framing the suspect</p>
<p>In addition to objecting to the transfer of the case, they requested that Jiang Zhang be temporarily detained for further investigation, and even if there was a crime, it was within the concession and should be handled by the court. Then, Chen Youde, a representative from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the informant Wu Zhenkang turned themselves in, proving the situation of buying and testing the drugs, and requested a transfer. Jiang Zhang stated that she and Wu Zhenkang were relatives and that after her husband died, the senior wife fled with Wu's mother, accumulating grudges. Finally, her defense attorney applied for bail, stating that her son Jiang Xiangwu had been detained by the Public Security Bureau. After discussion, Judge Yu Jiang Zhang allowed the detention until Friday for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Health Protection Association: Rapid Business Growth - Membership Exceeds 5,000</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Health Protection Association has been officially established for only ten days, but its affairs have shown a vigorous atmosphere. In terms of membership, the number of individuals who have joined as basic and special members has exceeded 1,300. Group members include the Commercial Press, Jin Cheng Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Siming Bank, Siming Savings Society, Siming Insurance Company, China Industrial Bank, Silk Industry Bank, Da Wan Bao, Shanghai Municipal Bank, Municipal Credit Trust Society, Municipal Ferry Management Office, and more than ten other units. The Commercial Press has the largest number of employees, with a total of more than 1,600 people. Major industrial and commercial groups in this city are currently contacting and promoting health protection work to popularize public medical protection, which is why they have gained the sympathy and support of the public. The Commercial Press is the largest cultural enterprise in China. Wang Yunwu, the general manager of the press, greatly approves of the various facilities of the Health Protection Association. In order to improve the health and welfare of employees and increase service efficiency, he believes that cooperation between the two parties is necessary, so the entire group joined to show their support. As the number of members increases and medical affairs become more complex, in addition to the original specialist doctors, newly hired on-duty doctors Wang Baoren, Chen Yingu, Cheng Qianqian, Zhao Pinlian, etc., provide full-day service. Recently, more than ten major hospitals in this city have been specially contracted for members' hospitalization. According to a report from the association's medical department, most of those who have come to the association for consultation recently have been suffering from epidemics and lung diseases. As for the attached pharmacy department, business is also not bad. In addition to members, citizens also patronize it very much, because the association is committed to service and offers very low prices, which has won the trust of the general public.</p>
<h3>The Yuanning Lecture Hall Completed at the End of Daxilu Road - Built by Yuan Ying, Chairman of the Buddhist Association - Inauguration Ceremony Scheduled for the 21st</h3>
<p>Yuan Ying, chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association in this city, considering that Shanghai does not have an independent lecture hall, spent money to build the Yuanning Lecture Hall at the end of Daxilu Road, Jing'an Temple Road. The hall occupies about 2.7 acres of land. The lecture hall is located in the center and is entirely built with steel and concrete. It has nine rooms in a row.

<h3>Exhibition of Zhang Xian's Posthumous Works - Commercial Press to Publish a Special Collection</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the exhibition of the posthumous works of the late painter Mr. Zhang Xian, there has been an endless stream of visitors. A large number of foreigners have also attended the exhibition, and their impressions have been excellent. They all believe that it is a rare work in recent times. The local newspapers have published feature articles praising Mr. Zhang's character and art. The French daily newspaper also published a long review the day before yesterday (the 16th), calling him one of the greatest contemporary draftsmen, "or even the only great draftsman." The number of works on display has reached more than 100. Mr. Zhang's students have even brought paper and pens to the exhibition to copy his works, which shows how deeply Mr. Zhang's works move people. It is now heard that the preparatory office of the exhibition has decided to extend the exhibition period to the 22nd of this month (Sunday) in response to requests from all walks of life. In the past two days, art lovers such as Cai Yuanpei, Du Yuesheng, and Qian Xinzhi have jointly purchased works worth more than 500 yuan. Wang Yunwu of the Commercial Press has specially sent Huang Xianong to the exhibition to select 18 oil paintings and 36 sketches to prepare for the publication of three volumes of Zhang Xian's special collection.</p>

<h3>Western Paint Industry Association Accuses Merchants - Defendant Submits Account Books - Dispute Over a Small Shortage in Rent Collection - Both Parties Have Conflicting Testimony</h3>
<p>The Western Paint Industry Association of this city elected representative Ma Shangjie and retained a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court's criminal court against merchants Le Zhenbao, Bei Runsheng, Zhang Lanping, and Le Gengrong for a property dispute involving the management of the East New Bridge Foreign Goods Business Association. The case has been heard several times, and the circumstances of suspending the accounts for inspection and verification have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the eighth hearing of the continuation of the trial. The defendants, along with defense attorneys Li Zuyu, Lin Yingqing, Yuan Hanyun, Wang Manyun, and Yan Yinwu, arrived at the court at around 3 PM. Bei Runsheng went to Nanjing on business and was represented by his attorney. The plaintiff also arrived with attorney Chao Kun. Chen Shuoying, with the assistance of Clerk Wang Baoxun, presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. First, the plaintiff's representative, Ma Shangjie, was asked, "Now that the defendants have submitted the account books from 1925 to 1935, where do you say the embezzlement occurred?" He replied, "Attorney Chao reviewed the case files the other day and discovered that there were discrepancies in the signatures on the minutes of the meeting. Furthermore, they discovered that there were discrepancies in the rent collection, with the rent for the Xinkang Coal Shop being collected more but recorded less, with a difference of 20 yuan per month." The plaintiff should record the defendant's criminal facts in the complaint in accordance with Article 112, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law and requested the court to pay attention. Defendant's attorney Li Zuyu stated that the plaintiff claimed that there was a shortage in the rent, which constituted the defendants' criminal act of embezzlement. He asked whether the plaintiff had discovered any other irregularities. Defendant's attorney Yan Yinwu stated that there was no precedent since the establishment of the court for filing a lawsuit without listing the facts first and then listing them as the defendant's criminal facts after reviewing the account books. The court then questioned the defendants Le Zhenbao and Zhang Lanping about the shortage in rent collection, asking if they had any reply. Le and Zhang both stated that they needed to inquire before they could reply, as they did not know the details at the moment. However, the rent also involved subletting by second and third landlords and tenants, so they needed to rely on the rent receipts. The official ordered the plaintiff Ma Shangjie to check the account books to verify the shortage in rent collection. Ma asked the court to check a line on the roll-over account for 1934 regarding the rent collection from the Xinkang Coal Shop and presented a letter from Han Zhikang, the owner of the Xinkang Shop. Le Zhenbao and Zhang Lanping both stated that they needed to ask Feng Zhengming, the rent collector, about the rent. Le Anrong stated that he did not care about rent collection matters. After reviewing the statements, the court decided to adjourn the trial to the 26th and summon witnesses Feng Zhengming and Han Zhikang for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Sends Aircraft to Scatter Air Tickets and Leaflets</h3>
<p>The 28th drawing of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery has been scheduled for November 6 at Yiyuan, Albert Road, French Concession. It is heard that the China National Aviation Corporation, in order to assist in the publicity and to attract the attention of people from all walks of life, has specially sent an aircraft to scatter leaflets to various ports.

<h3>German Ship's Stevedores Demand Foreign-Based Wages</h3>
<p>The Duisburg, a ship of the German Hamburg Shipping Company operating on the Sino-German-American route, docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou after arriving in Shanghai to unload cargo. All the stevedores were contracted by the Fu'an Company on Broadway Road. Recently, a majority of the stevedores joined the labor union and requested the company to change the wages, originally calculated in copper coins, to be based on foreign rates, but this was rejected by the company. At 11 AM the day before yesterday, a dispute occurred while more than 100 stevedores were working on the German ship. Union members and workers loyal to the company argued with each other. As a result, an Indian watchman named Bddar Din was injured in the waist and other parts of his body for trying to instigate a conflict and was sent to the hospital for treatment. By 1 PM, the unionized workers all went ashore together. At 9 AM yesterday morning, the workers hired by the company were unloading cargo, and the union workers boarded the ship again, demanding to join and taking the same steps. For a time, all work on the ship came to a complete standstill. After being informed, the Maritime Customs Water Police Station sent detectives Huang Songsheng and Zhou Zenghua, as well as several Chinese and Western police officers, to board the ship to suppress the situation. By noon, the union workers had been persuaded to leave the ship and go ashore, so the company's workers were able to continue working in the afternoon. It is likely that this labor-capital dispute will be sent to the party and government authorities for mediation.</p>

<h3>Inheritance Case - Lawyer Accused of Intimidation</h3>
<p>In Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, there was a deceased wealthy woman, Sheng Lu, who had two daughters, one named Gu Sheng and one named Xu Sheng. Xu Sheng had an inheritance of 10,000 taels, which was kept by Sheng Lu because Xu Sheng had passed away. Now, Xu Peigen, the son of Xu Sheng, hired attorney Rong Zhenglong to sue Gu Sheng in the local court, requesting the return of the inheritance. A judgment has been issued ordering the return. However, before the judgment was served, attorney Rong, representing Xu Peigen, sent a letter to Gu Sheng, setting a deadline of three days to hand over the money, otherwise it would be treated as a criminal act of embezzlement. After receiving the letter, Gu Sheng believed that attorney Rong's letter was intimidating and hired attorney Sha Xunyi to sue attorney Rong for intimidation in the court's criminal division. Yesterday, Judge Miao opened the trial. Because the defendant did not arrive, the hearing was adjourned for further summons.</p>
<h3>Use of Counterfeit Tickets - Two People Give Conflicting Statements</h3>
<p>Zhu Qingliang, from Huzhou, brought Wang Xingcai to the XunDao Street Police Station in Nanshi yesterday, accusing Wang of using altered banknotes, requesting investigation and punishment. According to Zhu, he works in a tobacco and currency exchange shop at No. 623 Zhonghua Road. Yesterday, Wang came to the shop to exchange banknotes for seven yuan, consisting of a five-yuan note and a one-yuan note from the Bank of China. However, the banknotes were stamped with a seal as a mark. Unexpectedly, today Wang brought a five-yuan note, which was found to be a Shandong Bank note altered to a Farmers and Merchants Bank note, claiming that it was given by my shop and insisted on exchanging it. In fact, my shop had never given this altered banknote. Wang confessed that he is from Taicang and now runs a fruit shop at No. 642 Zhonghua Road. The day before yesterday, he exchanged a five-yuan note from the Farmers and Merchants Bank at Zhu's shop, which he then took to a pawnshop to redeem an item. However, the people in the pawnshop said that the Chinese and Western characters on the note were different, which shows that it had been altered and could not be used. So he went to Zhu's shop to exchange it, but Zhu refused to admit it and instead accused me of using an altered banknote. As the two sides gave conflicting statements, they were determined to have used altered banknotes and were ordered to prepare a report, along with the evidence, and submit it to the main bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>A Woman Attempted Suicide by Drowning in Wusong Yesterday Morning - Matsumoto Sayako Jumped into the River - Constable Jie Ziyuan Bravely Rescued Her</h3>
<p>At 1:50 AM yesterday morning, a Japanese girl suddenly came to the eastern end of the Bund Park on Wusong Waima Road and lingered there. After being discovered by Constable Jie Ziyuan on duty at post No. 3, he went forward to inquire. The girl claimed that she wanted to make a phone call and was taken to the Wusong Police Station. After being questioned by Director Zhan, the girl identified herself as Matsumoto Sayako, 19 years old, living at No. 82 Haining Road, Shanghai. She then claimed that she had lost a watch in Shanghai Bund Park and insisted on going there to find it. Director Zhan ordered a police officer to accompany her. Unexpectedly, as soon as the girl arrived at Bund Park, she took advantage of the police officer's unpreparedness and ran to the seawall, jumping into the river. Seeing this, Constable Jie Ziyuan, feeling responsible, bravely jumped down to rescue her. The girl was rescued without drowning and was sent to the health office for treatment. At the same time, the Japanese consulate was notified, and patrol chief Yamatai and Kaize Wataru were sent to Wusong with Liang Fuchu, the director of the North Station Public Security Bureau, to take her back. However, the girl refused to reveal the reason for her suicide attempt.</p>
<h3>The United States-China Bank Case: Three More Plaintiffs Added; Bao Ziwen and Chen Yizai Interrogated Separately; Both Released on Bail with Lawyers' Written Guarantees</h3>
<p>Following the collapse of the United States-China Bank, numerous creditors have filed criminal charges of fraud and embezzlement with the First Special District Court against Gu Yubo and others responsible for the bank. Some creditors have even included Lin Kanghou, Shen Jingzhong, Qian Chengxu, Jiang Baili, and others who initiated the Dasin Bank (the predecessor to the United States-China Bank) as defendants, leading to multiple court hearings. Except for Jiang Baili, who has already gone abroad and had his lawsuit withdrawn by the plaintiffs, Gu Yubo and Liu Tongfu are wanted by the court, and Sun Wenkui has been placed under the responsibility of his</p>
<p>defense lawyer</p>
<p>Lin Yingqing, who secured his release on bail. The other defendants await further investigation. This newspaper has been reporting on these developments. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued the trial. The defendants who personally appeared were Bao Ziwen, Chen Yizai, Sun Wenkui, and Wang Zhonglin. Zhang Xusheng, Li Yichou, and Lin Kanghou were represented by lawyers Qian Zheng, Tang Huaiqun, Xu Jie, Wang Chuang'e, and others. Qian Chengxu and Wu Chunlei remained absent despite being summoned. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have added Chen Yimin, Zhang Yaojun, and Chen Peilun, bringing the total number of plaintiff households to twenty-four, alleging</p>
<p>embezzlement and fraud</p>
<p>amounting to over forty to fifty thousand yuan. In court, given the close relationship between defendants Bao and Chen, they were interrogated separately. Bao Ziwen was questioned first and stated that he was originally from Shaoxing and a salt merchant. Dasin Bank was planned the year before last with a capital of 500,000 yuan. He and Chen jointly subscribed for 50,000 yuan, which was handed over to Gu Yubo for collection, and he held Gu's receipt. Since the bank did not open, he did not receive formal stock certificates. He claimed to be unaware of the subsequent change to the United States-China Bank. The plaintiff's attorney, Wu Peng, then presented a photograph of the merger agreement between Dasin and the United States-China Bank and a photograph of Bao as a standing director of the United States-China Bank, as well as</p>
<p>United States-China Bank opening</p>
<p>telegrams of congratulations sent to the standing directors from other cities. After the court reviewed these documents, they were shown to Bao, but Bao still claimed to be unaware of the United States-China Bank's affairs. Judge Huang instructed him, "You are one of the founders of Dasin Bank and a standing director of the United States-China Bank. How can you claim to be unaware of the merger and the opening of the United States-China Bank? Moreover, after the merger, there was a board meeting, and your signature is on the record. You should explain the United States-China Bank's operations and the location of its account books. You cannot evade responsibility with mere excuses." However, Bao firmly denied serving as a standing director and said he</p>
<p>had no way to account</p>
<p>Bao's defense lawyer, Jiang Yiping, then presented the United States-China Bank's circular book, proving that Bao and Chen had never gone to the bank to handle affairs. He also presented a letter proving that Bao and Chen had not yet taken up their positions as directors. He then presented a photograph of the opening day of the United States-China Bank, stating that Bao was not in it, and further defended Bao and Chen, arguing that their 50,000 yuan had also been swindled away by Gu. Chen Yizai, when questioned, also denied being a shareholder or deputy manager of the United States-China Bank, claiming that the 15,000 yuan he had paid was for Dasin Bank shares. However, attorney Wu then presented a book of minutes from the United States-China Bank's western director meetings, stating that Chen and Bao's</p>
<p>duties</p>
<p>were clearly recorded in these minutes. Western directors such as Meng Lei and others were willing to appear in court as witnesses under subpoena. Therefore, there was no way to deny it with empty words. Subsequently, the court questioned Sun Wenkui, Wang Zhonglin, and the liquidators one by one, and ordered that the cases be adjourned to the afternoon of October 30 for further hearing. Bao Ziwen and Chen Yizai were ordered to each post an 8,000 yuan shop guarantee. Lawyer Jiang, upon hearing the order, repeatedly requested for Bao and Chen that the amount of the guarantee be reduced, otherwise they would not be able to afford it. Judge Huang then ordered lawyer Jiang to be responsible for bailing out the two defendants with a written guarantee pending trial.</p>
<h3>After Ma Loufen Was Convicted of Adultery, His Wife Filed for Divorce; Mediation Failed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ma Loufen, a film actor from Suzhou, aged 27, married Bai Suzhen (aged 21) from Beiping. They lived with his parents at 16 Xing Shun Nan Li, Remi Road in the French Concession. They had a daughter named Die Nv, and their marital relationship was good. However, Ma led the Star Singing and Dancing Troupe to perform in Southeast Asia. During the trip, he had a relationship with Wei Dixian, a 19-year-old troupe member from Hangzhou, and upon returning to Shanghai, he took her as a concubine, renting a house at 266 La Du Road from August 1 to cohabit with her. He neglected his wife, Bai. On the night of the 2nd of this month, Ma's wife, Bai, reported to the French police that Ma was committing adultery with Wei, disrupting the family. The head of the police station dispatched detectives to arrest Ma and Wei and handed them over to the Special Second Court for public prosecution. After the trial, Ma Loufen and Wei Dixian were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment, suspended for three years. Now, Ma's wife, Bai, through her lawyer, Jia Lu, filed a petition with the Civil Division of the Special Court, requesting mediation to divorce her husband, Ma Loufen, and for the payment of alimony. Upon receiving the petition, the court, yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Song in the Civil Court No. 4, summoned both parties for mediation. The petitioner, Ma Bai, stated that since her husband had committed adultery and cohabited with Wei Dixian, he had not returned home and had neglected her. She had also been abused by her in-laws, leaving her no choice but to request mediation for divorce. The opposing party, Ma Loufen, stated that he opposed the divorce. His wife also knew about his marriage to Wei. They initially lived in the same house, but because they did not get along, he moved out to live separately. He had not abused his wife, and they had always been on good terms. He did not know why she had suddenly filed a complaint. After examining the arguments, the court, noting that both parties held firm to their positions, announced that mediation had failed and instructed the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Elder Brother Seduces Sister-in-Law; Does Not Know What Shame Is; Neither Man Nor Woman Allowed Bail</h3>
<p>Chen Caiyuan, from Yuyao, aged 69, has two sons. The elder, Chen Jinwen, aged 39, works at the Gold Exchange. The younger, Chen Jinrong, aged 22, used to run a coal shop and is now unemployed. Chen Yurong is married to Chen Ni, also aged 22. They used to live together in Huasheng Road, Zhabei, with only a board separating the brothers' rooms. However, Chen Jinrong had been unemployed for a long time and was short of money. He could not afford his wife's extravagance. Chen Jinwen, on the other hand, was lustful. Therefore, Jinwen coveted his young sister-in-law, while Ni envied her brother-in-law's wealth. Thus, an affair began. Chen Yurong eventually discovered it and began to monitor them. Chen Jinwen and Ni, after a heated discussion, first had Chen Jinwen move out, residing at 162 Kongjia Wood Bridge, Zhongxing Road. Then, on the 11th of last month, he instructed Ni to run away and notified Chen Jinrong of the divorce with a lawyer's letter. Jinrong did not show weakness and hired a lawyer to deal with it. He learned that his elder brother, Chen Jinwen, and Chen Ni were hiding in the Central Apartments on Kaizi Road, Eight Immortals Bridge, first in room number 2, then in room number 20. He reported it to the police with his lawyer, Zhang Shiying, and had Chen Jinwen and Chen Ni arrested and detained in the local court. At the same time, a pair of love letters written by Chen Jinwen were seized and attached to the file. The prosecutor cited Article 239 and Article 240, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law to indict them. Yesterday, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the trial. The defendants denied adultery, but claimed that Ni had been abused by her husband and asked lawyer Zhang Bao to write a letter notifying him of the divorce. Chen Jinwen claimed that he was acting on his father's orders to go and reconcile them, and happened to meet Ni in front of the Central Apartments, so he advised her. He did not expect to be arrested, etc. Their father, Chen Caiyuan, testified in court that he knew nothing about his elder son's adultery with his younger daughter-in-law. Chen Jinrong testified that this was proven by Zhang Shiying's lawyer who went with him to arrest them. The love letter seized was written by his elder brother. However, he and his brother were half-brothers. Now that his father and relatives have come to mediate, he requested that they be allowed bail first, and they would withdraw the charges after the conditions were agreed upon. The judge, however, reasoned that there was no such free and convenient way to first grant bail and then discuss conditions when a lawsuit was involved. Therefore, he ruled that bail was not allowed. The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Fei Xiuzhen's Case Against Her Paramour Resolved; Court Rules Case Not Accepted</h3>
<p>Fei Xiuzhen, a local woman aged 30, was married to Pan Yuelu, a teacher, and had several children. After Pan died four years ago, Fei, unwilling to remain a widow, became acquainted with Li Chengyuan, a former employee of the Lianglu Road Bureau from Yangzhou, last year, and cohabited with him at 36 Xinxingli, North Sichuan Road. After the death of Fei's late husband, she inherited a considerable amount of property. After she began cohabiting with Li, Li used the pretext of starting a business and borrowed a total of 5,700 yuan from Fei, all with written IOUs. Recently, Li's father became acquainted with a prostitute named Xiuqin Lao Jiu from the Fuxiangli brothel on Guangxi Road, leading to frequent conflicts between Fei and Li. On the 27th of last month, Fei went to Xiuqin's place to negotiate with Li. After a brief conflict, Fei did not return home that evening. Li then secretly returned and stole the written IOUs and other items and fled. Fei reported it to the Hongkou Police Station, and Chinese detective Liu Zhaonian arrested Li and handed him over to the First Special District Court. Li claimed that he and Fei had held a wedding ceremony and had a marriage certificate. The court stated that further investigation was needed and announced that the case would be adjourned, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, this case was further heard by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Criminal Court No. 5. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated that, according to reports, the plaintiff and defendant had reached a settlement during the adjournment period, with Li Chengyuan writing seven additional IOUs to Fei. However, this further proved the defendant's criminal behavior. Next, Fei's lawyer, Fan Gang, stated that the case had been resolved and requested that the complaint be withdrawn. After Judge Zhan reviewed the IOUs written by Li and confirmed that they were in his own handwriting, he ruled that the case would not be accepted.</p>

<p>Ling Meimei, a 19-year-old granddaughter of the late Ling Fusheng, who lived next to the Public Security Bureau in Niheng Lane, Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, was not unattractive but was usually taciturn and focused on her needlework.

The groom's family sent betrothal gifts worth 300 yuan, and her aunt helped prepare her dowry, which cost a total of 500 yuan. However, Meimei still wanted to buy a watch and coat, but her aunt refused, and she became despondent. She bought a piece of opium somewhere and secretly swallowed it the night before. Around midnight, the poison took effect, and she groaned in bed. Her grandmother discovered it and immediately took her to the hospital set up by the Health Bureau. The doctor gave her an injection, but it was too late. She was taken back home and died.

Therefore, we specially petition your union to promptly forward this to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering its subordinates to swiftly arrest the adulterer and adulteress, ensuring that none escape the net, so that they can be brought to justice as soon as possible and sentenced to capital punishment.

<h3>Fire Sparks from Celluloid Shavings Along the Wall</h3>
<p>Along the section of Minzhu Street, Fuyou Road in the Shanghai city, celluloid shops (that is, celluloid) are lined up. The shop staff often dump celluloid shavings at the foot of the wall at the intersection, piled up like hills. Celluloid is most easily flammable. Yesterday (the 19th) at 12:45 a.m., a fire started when a pedestrian threw a leftover cigarette butt into the pile of celluloid shavings. The fire flared up instantly, and the flames were so fierce that they could not be approached, causing the bamboo curtains of the Weisheng South Goods Shop at No. 61 to ignite. Fortunately, the shop staff managed to put out the fire. By the time the fire trucks from various districts arrived, the smoke had long since dissipated.</p>

<h3>Small Fire Caused by Foreign Emerald Shavings by the Wall</h3>
<p>Foreign emerald shops (that is, celluloid) line the section of Minzhu Street, Fuyou Road in Shanghai, and the shop staff often dump foreign emerald shavings at the foot of the wall at the intersection, piled up like hills. Foreign emeralds are most easily flammable. Yesterday (19th) at 0:45 a.m., a fire was caused when a pedestrian threw a cigarette butt into the pile of foreign emerald shavings. The fire flared up instantly, and the flames were so fierce that they could not be approached, causing the bamboo curtains of the Weisheng South Goods Shop at No. 61 to ignite. Fortunately, the shop staff managed to put out the fire. By the time the fire trucks from various districts arrived, the smoke had long since dissipated.</p>
<h3>Demanding Old Debt, Creditor Wounded with Knife</h3>
<p>Zhu Bi, a woman from Yancheng, aged 45, makes a living by lending money at high interest rates. She lives in a bungalow on Zhangjia Road, Zhabei. During the winter of last year, Shen Jingui, a peddler from Funing, borrowed five yuan from her, promising to pay back two jiao in silver dollars per day, including principal and interest. However, Shen only paid back a little over ten jiao and then disappeared. It wasn't until yesterday afternoon at around 4 p.m. that Zhu Bi finally found him. When she demanded the old debt, a verbal conflict ensued. Shen became enraged and stabbed Zhu Bi in the right cheek with a small knife, causing profuse bleeding. The police officer who saw it took them both to the station for questioning.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Inspecting European Sports (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Jiang Lianggui</p>
<p>(Berlin Correspondence) The 11th World Games were held in Berlin. In addition to sending a large delegation, the Sports Advancement Association of our country also organized a sports inspection team, selecting service personnel from the national sports community to come to Europe to participate in the World Games, and after the closing of the Games, went to various European countries with special history or achievements in sports for inspection, lasting a total of 18 days, visiting seven countries including Denmark, Sweden, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Austria, and Germany. The scope of the inspection included social sports, school sports, and other organizations such as youth training and labor service groups. I, as a reporter, was very honored to follow the gentlemen of the sports community to visit together. It is a pity that the time was too short, and there was no lack of regret for a cursory glance. Detailed inspection notes have been sent to the country in each country's journey, but what is described are some descriptions of the actual situation, lacking personal subjective criticism and feelings. Therefore, I specially write a little bit about the feelings and solutions to the questions that were previously considered doubtful, gained from this inspection. Although the sports of each country have their different social backgrounds and political propositions, we cannot judge what to copy them all, but on the whole, it can be used as a reference from other mountains.</p>
<p>(1) The Position of Physical Education in the School Curriculum</p>
<p>This is a consistent proposition and principle in any country. Whether we go to a fascist country or a democratic country, in the regulations promulgated by their Ministry of Education, there is always a clause saying "Physical education should occupy the first place in all courses in schools at all levels." Not long ago, the German Ministry of Education also recently promulgated a law stating that "Physical education is an important lesson in university coursework, and students with poor physical education grades will be given a grade retention or expulsion punishment." When this law was first promulgated, it was strongly opposed by some well-known people in society, but later, after careful testing and on-site investigation by the Ministry of Education, objective facts were used to prove that "Students with excellent physical education grades also have excellent academic grades." Therefore, the German Ministry of Education later explained that this measure not only does not affect the progress of science, but directly promotes it, and a group of opposing professors no longer grumble. Therefore, from this point of view, the emphasis on school physical education in Europe is a kind of national policy. Let's take a look at the school physical education situation in China. Anyone who pays a little attention to physical education knows that it is "bankrupt," "failed," and "equal to zero." The physical education in primary schools is, at most, one or two hours of pace, freehand exercises, and games per week. Providing children who are in the rising age of development with one or two hours of exercise per week is undoubtedly very little. What's more, there is a group of derelict physical education teachers who use this only one or two hours to shout a few "one two one" and turn left and right, and just perfunctorily pass it off. This is simply not education, this is destroying children, this is harming the health of the entire nation. Let's talk about middle school, it's even more messy. Students are called in absentia or simply don't have it. If there are a few schools that are serious about physical education, it is very pitiful, truly rare. Speaking of university, it can be said that there is none at all. What is the so-called university physical education in China now? At most, it is just university interscholastic competitions? Each school has a football team and a basketball team, and they often come out to play a few games. Those who can get the championship are successful. The general students, at least 90% or more, have nothing to do with physical education. Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly emphasized that "Entrance physical education should be included in regular classes," the result is that thorough implementation is of course out of the question, and even perfunctory compliance is not seen. Therefore, we see that a young person, from elementary school to university, the physique built in this kind of physical education environment cannot be morbid and weak. Perhaps there are a few sports enthusiasts in the school, and the result is the formation of a special class, only exercising and not studying. These morbidities and crises in school physical education naturally directly and indirectly contain countless factors, and the result of their interaction and evolution. However, I believe that the biggest problem, the most severe impact, is "the unimportant position of physical education in various courses." Because it is not important, physical education teachers have no status, physical education courses are not paid attention to, physical education funds are reduced and misappropriated, physical education grades are insignificant, and all kinds of malpractices are numerous. Therefore, we hope, we want to shout loudly, you people who run education, your responsibility is "to create perfect children, but you unconsciously what you have done in the past is to destroy children, to harm children, if you want to achieve your goals, to fulfill your responsibilities, you must change your past erroneous views, educate children, put physical education on the front line, make full use of it, and give full play to the value of physical education in education, and turn around quickly in this way, perhaps it can still be remedied and recovered in case of emergency.</p>
<p>(2) The Question of Differences and Similarities Between Male and Female Physical Education This question gave me a satisfactory answer during this inspection process. From observations in various aspects, and the results of inquiries with famous figures in the sports world in various countries, the conclusion we have reached is "Male and female physical education, in principle, can adopt the same training methods." We have seen many women whose activities and abilities in sports are not lower than men's. Originally, men and women have the same ability to survive and should enjoy equal training opportunities. The mistake of the past was that women's physical strength was thought to be weaker than men's, so physical activities should be different from men's. This is a fundamental mistake. You must know that the decline in women's physical fitness is by no means a morbidity, but a normal state. There are probably two reasons for the decline in women's physical fitness: A. Historical factors Because since human history, men have always been the center of society, and women have always been in a subordinate position, so women are always the protected and supported. The competition of life and the acquisition of food and clothing are all the sole responsibility of men. Since women do not need to operate, the opportunity for instinctive activities is reduced, so gradually evolved, and the physical fitness naturally gradually declined. Therefore, the decline in women's physical fitness is not an instinctive tendency, but the result of being influenced by history. If we continue to not give women appropriate activities, then in the future, perhaps women will not even be able to walk.</p>
<p>B. Physiological Factors The second reason is physiological. The physiological factors that most affect women's physical fitness are the lowering of the center of gravity. Women have a larger pelvis in preparation for childbirth, so the weight of the lower part increases, the center of gravity lowers, and action is inconvenient. At the same time, the pelvis expands, and the inclination of the legs also increases, making it difficult to swing. In addition, such as more fat, high specific gravity, loose muscles, etc., are all physiological factors that affect the ability to exercise.</p>
<p>Therefore, the reason why women's sports performance is not as good as men's and their physical strength is not as good as men's is the result of historical and physiological reasons. In fact, there is no difference in the physique of men and women. They need the same exercise and the same training. Of course, in fact, because of the above two reasons, in the present era, when training women, it must not be the same "amount" as men, but at least we can know that men's and women's physical education are the same in principle."</p>

The national famous general Zhang Liang maintained the championships in the one-mile and three-mile races.

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervisor, Sun Guofeng, Memorial Record</h3>
<p>The memorial service for Ministry of Education Supervisor Sun Guofeng was solemnly held at 9 a.m. on the 18th in the main auditorium of the Ministry of Education. In attendance were Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education, Division Chief Duan, along with bureau directors, secretaries, counselors, specialists, supervisors, and many other staff members from various divisions and offices, as well as senior officials from other ministries, councils, and the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, the Library, university presidents, provosts, leaders of academic organizations, and others, totaling more than 200 people. At the start of the meeting, everyone stood in solemn silence and bowed three times to Mr. Sun’s portrait. Minister Wang first offered a flower during the memorial ceremony, followed by Jin Yufu reading the eulogy. Next, Duan Xipeng, the Director of Educational Affairs, reported on Supervisor Sun’s work at the Ministry of Education and the course of his illness caused by overwork. Zhuang Changgong reported on Sun's diligence and achievements during his tenure at Northeastern University. Ding Xu reported on Sun's diligent study and thoughtful spirit during his time studying in the United States. Finally, Minister Wang reported that Supervisor Sun's inspection area was particularly broad during his time as a higher education inspector, and that he made many contributions based on his observations during the inspection, which greatly improved higher education. Today, looking at his portrait, not only are we personally saddened, but also as a public servant with specialized knowledge, loyalty, sincerity, and a willingness to work hard, we should mourn the loss of talent to the public. Mr. Sun was upright and his family was destitute. Efforts should be made to provide relief through public and private means. After the report, a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned. The venue was decorated with wreaths (from the Capital Memorial Service, the Nanjing Peking University Alumni Association, etc.) and elegiac couplets (from Zhuang Changgong, Su Shangda, Shen Qixun, Zhao Yuchang, Wang Xuehai, Cui Shunqing, etc.). Among them, the couplet jointly offered by the colleagues of the Capital Memorial Service was the most detailed and comprehensive, and also expressed regret and sorrow. The lyrics said, "He was versatile and talented throughout his life, specializing in engineering and science, and was early on expected to select elites and cultivate people. Now that the national crisis is at its height, how could it be that the horse herd is empty in Hebei?" "He was diligent and courageous in his duties, and his virtue was suddenly lost. Even if only the cold wind of Zhongfu remains, and the moon of Yantai is cold, thinking of his homeland in sight, we still expect him to transform into a crane and return to Liaodong." Now, Mr. Sun's brief biography is recorded below:</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Sun Guofeng: Mr. Sun's name was Guofeng, his courtesy name was Xianting, and his surname was Sun. He was a native of Changtu County, Liaoning Province. In his youth, he entered the provincial middle school, then transferred to a higher school, and then ascended to Peking University, where he studied physics. He always topped his class in every exam. After completing his studies, he stayed at the school as a teaching assistant. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, he passed the first higher civil service examination and was assigned to work in the Ministry of the Navy. Mr. Sun was not satisfied with this, so he went to the United States to study at Cornell University, still studying physics. After a long time, he obtained a doctorate degree and worked for an electric power company in a certain province, where he made many inventions. He returned after several years. At that time, the authorities in the Eastern Provinces were preparing to establish Northeastern University in Shenyang, and he was appointed as the Dean of Science. Later, the department was changed to a college, and he served as the Dean of the College of Science and Engineering for eight years. The students he cultivated numbered in the thousands, and they all happily left according to their wishes. In the autumn of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Sun had just resigned from his position at the university when the Shenyang Incident suddenly occurred. He went through the pass alone, wanting to save the situation, but to no avail. He then took the position of Dean of the College of Engineering at Peiping University. After more than a year, he was unhappy and resigned. Soon after, he was appointed as a specialist in the Ministry of Education and then received the order of supervisor, serving in the capital. Every year, he went to various provinces and cities to inspect schools above the specialist level, often traveling thousands of miles. When he returned, he worked on reports at his desk, without a single day of rest throughout the year. And Mr. Sun's illness was already lurking at this time. This summer, Mr. Sun was ordered to go to eastern Guangdong to inspect educational affairs. He braved the heat and traveled quickly. After more than a month of service, he returned and suffered from thirst and a fondness for eating melons, and also suffered from a sore throat. He went to Peiping for medical treatment. Later, he developed a fever and difficulty swallowing. The doctor diagnosed him with acute pneumonia. In just five or six days, he died at Shou Shan Hospital, on September 27 of the 25th year. Mr. Sun was calm and open-minded, and deeply thoughtful. He once said that he was healthy, so he was brave in taking on responsibilities, but in the end, he fell ill and died because of this. He died at the age of forty-eight. He had one son and two daughters. His son died three years ago, at the age of eight. Mr. Sun was also unhappy because of this. He was not good at accumulating wealth in his life, so there was no remaining savings after his death. All those who knew him said that he was in his prime and had not yet completed his achievements. When they heard that he had died of illness, they could not help but shed tears.</p>

<h3>Guohua Middle School Invited Shao Rugan to Lecture</h3>
<p>The Situation of Physical Education Promoted in Germany Shanghai West Guohua Middle School holds a memorial week every resolution, and invites celebrities to give lectures. On the 7th memorial week held yesterday,) In addition to the Dean of Education respectfully reading the Prime Minister's will and reporting on school affairs, Shao Rugan, who attended the World Games and traveled to seven countries, was specially invited to give a lecture. He said that the failure of our country in this World Games was not a failure of the athletes, but a failure of the weakness of our national physique. Looking around at the athletes of various countries, all are stalwart and extraordinary, full of energy, and our country is ashamed of being behind in comparison. Moreover, in each school in the other side, physical education is the most important, and German intellectual education is decided by it. Elementary school students who are not good at swimming cannot graduate, and middle school students with poor physical education scores cannot enter universities. The encouragement is like this, and I sincerely hope that our new youth will rise up and create a new country with a new spirit, so as not to be ridiculed as the sick man of East Asia. It is heard that Mr. Shao could not speak freely due to time constraints, and will continue the lecture when there is another opportunity.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang University Added Academic Inquiry Office Approved by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Zhejiang University approved the letter from the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education to send the resolution of the eighth meeting of the primary school conference office this spring, "Requesting that a letter be transferred to Zhejiang Da Bi to establish an academic inquiry office." The reason for this is that "educational science has a very close relationship with other academic disciplines. Therefore, Thorndike said that those engaged in education must have broad knowledge in order to cope with it easily. However, academic progress is constantly innovating, and primary school teachers' knowledge acquired during school education in the past is not enough to cope with the new environment. Even if they can read newspapers and magazines to make up for it, it is still difficult to find the necessary materials at times. Therefore, it is necessary to wait for inquiries. If a national university can establish an inquiry mechanism so that letters can be sent for inquiries, then there will be a way to seek advice, and difficulties can be solved." The Zhejiang University authorities believe that this theory is quite insightful, and the school affairs meeting decided to temporarily pilot it through the Academic Affairs Office, but it is limited to correspondence inquiries, that is, designating staff members of the teaching office to handle the receiving, sending, and sorting of these inquiry letters. All those outside the school who are interested in research can send academic questions directly to the school's Academic Inquiry Office. The office can then present them to the Dean of Academic Affairs nearby and forward them to the relevant department's professors for research and reply. It has expanded the scope and is not limited to primary school teachers. The brief outline of the office is appended below: 1. The university's affiliated academic inquiry office is for correspondence inquiries from outside the school on academic issues. 2. This inquiry is temporarily limited to correspondence inquiries. 3. All inquiries are limited to those with academic research value. 4. After receiving the questions, the office will submit them to the Dean of Academic Affairs and forward them to the professors of the relevant departments for reply. 5. All questions raised must describe the origins in detail for research purposes. 6. Incoming letters must be written clearly. 7. Incoming letters must include postage for registered mail for return. 8. If the reply to the questions raised is quite complicated, the office may charge a fee at its discretion. 9. Questions that do not meet the above rules will not be answered.</p>
<h3>The Publicity of the Achievement of the Scout Inspection Has Aroused Dissatisfaction in the Municipal Scout Community, and a Telegram Has Been Sent to the General Association to Investigate the Truth</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reported that the National Boy Scout Inspection and Camping was held in Beijing around the Double Tenth Festival. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. The scores and comments of the representative teams from various places were slightly published in various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai on the 16th. However, the Scout General Association officially corrected the reports to various newspapers the next day, believing that the published scores were not factual. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Boy Scout Council, the reporter of Guomin News Agency said, "When the municipal representative team went to Beijing, the campsite newspaper organized by the conference had defamatory remarks about the municipal scouts, fabricating facts and arbitrarily issuing comments, and published them in various newspapers in Beijing. Afterwards, it published unofficial total scores in newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, and noted that "Shanghai's performance was the worst." Although the news was officially corrected by the General Association, there must be a small number of unscrupulous people using written publicity with the intention of destroying the city's real military undertakings. According to the municipal Boy Scout Council, although the designated camp area was very narrow when the municipal Boy Scouts participated in the conference in Beijing this time, and could not fully provide suitable use for campsite life, all equipment and arrangements were operated by the scouts themselves. Although we dare not boast that the various achievements are good, we are confident that they will not be the worst." It is also known that the Municipal Boy Scout Council has telegraphed the General Association yesterday to ask them to thoroughly investigate the person in charge of publishing inaccurate scores, so as not to confuse the public.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Spot Yarn Supply Interrupted, Standard Yarn Surged to Limit Up, Only 7,000 Odd Packages of Yarn Remaining in Warehouses, Total Turnover of 400,000 Packages in the First Three Months, Short Accounts Panic, Making Every Effort to Cover Positions, Spot Yarn Up 17 Yuan, Thread Up 40 Yuan, Market Sentiment Higher Than It Has Been in More Than a Decade</h3>
<p>The soaring yarn market is like a runaway horse. The prosperity of fabric demand is the real reason. All parties are particularly eager to collect cotton yarn, resulting in an interruption of spot yarn supply. Not only do factories have no goods to supply, but only 7,000 odd packages of yarn remain in yarn warehouses. However, all parties only seek to obtain spot yarn, regardless of the selling price, which makes the upward trend even more intense. This phenomenon has not been seen in more than a decade. The total number of standard yarn contracts concluded in the first three months was about 400,000 packages. Short sellers, seeing the extreme tightness of spot goods and the fact that prices are more than 10 yuan cheaper than spot yarn, are panicking and are in a state of panic. As a result, the market has skyrocketed, and the forward contracts for the first three months have risen to the limit up, creating an unprecedented new record in the history of the exchange.</p>
<p>Near and Distant Months Rise by Eight or Nine Yuan Each</p>
<p>The standard yarn market opened higher in early trading due to the tightening of spot yarn supply. As the current month is not far from the delivery period, short covering flocked in, and the market rose sharply by 4 yuan, with the distant month rising by 2 to 3 yuan. When the second board opened, the buying momentum continued unabated, rising another 4 yuan. The situation in the November contract became even more panicky, jumping rapidly to the limit up. The momentum in the distant month was slightly calmer. By the close, it was heard that spot Jincheng yarn was rising by 13 to 14 yuan, but there was still no spot goods to buy. The trading atmosphere in the market suddenly became intense, and the distant month jumped up another 2 yuan. As a result, each month's closing price was up by 8 yuan to 8.8 yuan compared to the previous day, and the distant month was up by 4.4 yuan to 4.5 yuan. When trading opened in the afternoon, buyers continued to flock to the near three months, but sellers were scarce. For a time, there was a stalemate, but the blackboard was still black. The upward momentum for December and beyond remained strong. The second board suddenly fell by 2 yuan. The near month added value, but no one sold. The distant month tightened up, jumping up 2 yuan. By the close, it was heard that spot Jincheng yarn and others were rising again, and the buying momentum was extremely strong, soaring by 2 yuan. The distant months all broke through the 220 yuan barrier. As a result, each month's price rose again by 4.1 yuan to 4.5 yuan compared to the morning close. According to reports, the selling came from Mingde (2,400 packages), Zhengji (1,750 packages), Hengyi (6,000 packages), Dafeng (8,250 packages), Jinchang (2,900 packages), Minghua (2,250 packages), Xingchang (2,050 packages), Fengtai (1,750 packages), Renfeng (3,600 packages), Yuan Yi (1,250 packages), Runkang (2,050 packages), Dachang (1,150 packages), Shengyuan (1,350 packages), Fukang (5,150 packages), Jinkang (1,900 packages), Yicheng (2,050 packages), and Taichang (1,800 packages).

<p>Spot Yarn Swept Clean</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still brisk, presenting a situation where there is a market but no goods. According to statistics, various gangs bought a total of 1,239 packages throughout the day, with the selling price soaring by 14 to 17 yuan. The money price rose sharply by 30 to 40 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 60, Hankou 50, Inland 429, Wuhu 50</p>
<p>Tianjin 350, Colleagues 150, Changsha 110</p>
<h3>Factory Demand Active, Cotton Also Shows Rising Trend, Cotton Yarn Soars, Price Difference Widens Daily, Excessive Short Positions Cause Violent Rebound</h3>
<p>The cotton market was originally flat and tired. Because large accounts tended to sell off, the pressure was particularly heavy. However, because the yarn market soared and the price difference was far apart, the short sellers became active in covering their positions. Yarn sales were lively, and spot cotton factory demand developed. Cotton prices in various producing areas soared. As a result, the market suddenly tightened, and the market price rose sharply.</p>
<p>Cotton Soars by More Than Two Yuan</p>
<p>The standard cotton market opened higher in early trading, aided by the yarn market and because the short sellers had been pressing too hard in the previous day, so a rebound suddenly occurred. Each month rose by 8 to 9 jiao to 1 yuan. The second board was flat. By the third close, the buying momentum was even more intense because the yarn price was jumping, with the near month rising another 6.5 jiao and the distant month rising 3 to 4 jiao. When trading opened in the afternoon, short sellers were active in covering their positions in the October contract, rising 2 to 3 jiao. The distant month fell by 1 jiao instead. By the third close, the market was extremely tight due to the scarcity of yarn, and it jumped 4 to 5 jiao again. As a result, each month's price rose again by 5 jiao to 7.8 jiao and 1 yuan compared to the morning close. According to reports, the selling came from Dafeng (19,000 dan), Yuan Yi (4,200 dan), Jinkang (4,200 dan), Jifeng (4,400 dan), Juxing (4,400 dan), Yuanda (3,400 dan), Jinchang (9,700 dan), Mingde (32,800 dan), Qingda (4,000 dan), Minghua (5,000 dan), Changyu (6,500 dan), Hengde (4,500 dan), Dachangcheng (6,800 dan), Taichang (20,200 dan), Runkang (20,500 dan), Xiecheng (7,800 dan), Shengyuan (3,200 dan).

<h3>Piece Goods, Cotton Cloth Sold Out, All Goods Reached a New High Price in the Last Five Years</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market experienced a surge of more than 10 yuan in spot yarn and thread prices, and the standard yarn's near month suddenly surged by 8 yuan to a limit up. The cloth market was extremely tense as a result, and all types of cotton cloth rose sharply. White goods saw the most significant increase in fine cloth, rising by 4.5 to 6.5 jiao (per bolt). Fine twill rose by 2 to 5 jiao (per bolt), plain cloth rose by 1 to 2.5 jiao (per bolt), coarse cloth rose by 3.5 to 7 jiao (per bolt), and flannel rose by 4 jiao (per bolt).

Patterned goods, Zhigong, serge, thread tweed, and patterned flannel all reached about 2 fen (per yard), causing all goods to reach a new high point in the last five years. Yesterday, various brokers continued to operate with enthusiasm. Factories were in a state of distress due to the lack of spot yarn and thread, so they refused to accept new transactions. Only the local number houses slightly sold out their stock, making a fortune. However, Japanese factories offered December futures of white goods such as Dragon Head brand fine cloth, with prices increasing by 4 jiao (per bolt) compared to the previous weekend, and the stocks of various factories and number houses were sold out.</p>
<h3>Grain, Wheat Price Advances Straight Ahead, Since Autumn, Dry Weather Has Caused Traders and Customers to Ignore Prices and Mark Up All Months by More Than 1 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market was sharply higher in all months at the opening in the morning. Although the Chicago Board of Trade wheat quotations were still slightly lower by 1 to 2.3 jiao, the arrival of wheat shipments is gradually decreasing, and traders are unanimously holding on and reluctant to let go. Moreover, the weather has been mostly sunny and dry since autumn, and there is a feeling of drought everywhere. Therefore, although rumors of the current situation have gradually subsided, the dry weather has aroused enthusiasm among people. Opening prices for all months were raised by 5, 6, and 7 fen. When trading opened in the afternoon, the active price increases in the yarn and cloth market aroused enthusiasm outside the industry, and buying was even stronger for all months, with prices advancing straight ahead without looking back. The increase for the day was 1.1 jiao to 1.5 jiao. With this situation, there will probably be many more disturbances in the future. In the spot wheat market, prices were also raised by 6 to 7 fen, with Shandong wheat opening at 9.87 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 5.82 yuan, Yaowan wheat at 5.71 yuan to 5.77 yuan, Guangshui wheat at 5.62 yuan to 5.68 yuan, Yanghe wheat at 5.75 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 5.5 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 5.7 yuan, and the second grade at 5.64 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 5.6 yuan. Six thousand packages were handled by Fuxin, three thousand packages were handled by Fufeng, and one thousand packages were handled by Shenda.</p>
<h3>Wheat Inventory Gradually Empty, Flour Shows Unprecedented High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an initial flat and then rising trend in the morning trading of various months. As the price of foreign wheat at Chicago and Canada were still down slightly by 1 or 2.3 jiao, people's sentiments were still calm when the prices opened. However, after the second board, the wheat market rose first, and merchants from local and outside reacted to the dry weather and the fear that it would affect planting, resulting in strong buying momentum and a gradual increase in prices. When trading opened in the afternoon, the market became active again, and various factories were not inclined to pre-sell their positions. As the wheat inventory was getting smaller and smaller, people's sentiments were strong. Furthermore, there was a rumor of war and various parties were preparing food, so the market's enthusiastic atmosphere was not easily calmed down. As for the market value of each month, it has reached the highest price seen in many years.</p>
<h3>North and South Gangs Compete to Handle Ke Xian, 21,000 Packages Traded, Market Rises Sharply by 1-2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Ke Bi market saw a thriving atmosphere due to the sudden rise in Ke Wei's activity. The total trading volume even increased nine times compared to last Saturday, totaling more than 21,500 packages. As Ke Wei seemed to have continued interest, people became more hopeful. During the morning opening, prices continued to fall with a lingering sluggish atmosphere from the previous week, and some cargo owners still lowered prices to seek sales. Then, the Guangdong gang suddenly became active and bought more than 10,000 packages of rough rice, while Shantou and Beiyang competed to handle machine-milled Xian. The local market also became active, and Quanzhou also showed interest, so the market rose sharply by 1-2 jiao, and rough rice became even more attractive. Throughout the day, 7,220 packages of Gan rice, 13,100 packages of Xiang rice, 200 packages of Taiwanese Xian, and 1,000 packages of Sha rough rice were opened.</p>
<h3>New and Old Bian Yuan Dismantled Oddly Expensive</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the source from various gangs totaled 24 or 25 companies, with a total of more than 5,000 shi of goods. Among them, thick japonica rice accounted for the majority, so local sales were sluggish, and the price of thick new japonica rice fell by 5 fen to nearly 1 jiao. As for the kiln-grown Bai Ge, there were 1,300 to 1,400 packages of what were called Qingdao Yantai Beiping, as well as some thin broken Bai and hundreds of packages of thick new japonica rice. As a result, the market for kiln-grown increased by 5 fen, Bai Ge was still fixed, Du Yangjian was neither honored nor disgraced, and there was no fixed standard for thick and thin broken japonica rice. New Yin Yuan was quite stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, 30 to 40 ships arrived from various routes downstream. The appetites of various types of traders in the market turned weak, and the market price for new japonica rice was barely supported, with the middle-grade being tired by several fen and broken japonica rice being flat and tired. The price of Yang Du Bu Ke Jian continued to tighten by 3 to 5 fen. Kiln seed had no honor or disgrace. The new and old Bian Yuan were quite popular due to the scarcity of goods and dismantling, and the price rose by 2 to 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Source of Yellow Soybeans Has Been Scarce Recently</h3>
<p>The yellow soybean market has been sluggish due to the lack of vehicles on the railway bureau and the inconvenience of transportation, resulting in a temporary scarcity of sources. Moreover, the annual harvests in Henan Province vary in abundance, so the market sentiments are strong and rising. The exchange's standard soybean price first rose, and the spot market price followed suit. Yesterday's price rose by 3 to 5 fen compared to the weekend. The route was still inquired by the export oil factory and the local market. More than 4,000 packages of various beans were opened in the market. As for the white eyebrow beans in New Zhuang, firstly, the price of good goods was high and the appetite was sluggish, and secondly, the market in Dalian was soft. It was heard that 1,000-odd packages of Sipingjie beans could be shipped with the white eyebrow beans in New Zhuang, so the overall trend was weaker than other beans. Yesterday, only 230 packages of body beans were handled by the local market, with a price of 5.83 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance Pure Gold Continues to Rise, Standard Gold Gradually Flourishes, Nearly Approaching the Sixty Yuan Mark... Final Result is an Additional 2.6 Yuan</h3>

<h3>Securities Bond Market Rises and Falls Unevenly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market situation was quite flickering. Initially, it was tired due to people's unease, then it rose due to the good yarn flowers, and finally it fell due to many rumors. Taking advantage of the trend, it finally felt unable to cheer up. The environment is also entering a new period of change after the Hangzhou talks, and Sino-Japanese negotiations will continue to begin. After this extremely depressing atmosphere, there may be new developments, and the future is full of reversals. Yesterday's experience, the opening market sentiment was uncertain, the selling atmosphere was stronger, and the market price consistently weakened, small 5 cents one dime to three dimes. The second round turned slightly stronger, slightly better 5 cents to one dime, Type E slightly weakened one and a half dimes.

The afternoon market continued to be good, and spot futures rose again by 4 to 7 yuan. In Lyon, only Guangdong silk rose by one franc due to a shortage of goods, and the rest of the silk products maintained their original price. In the local silk market, manufacturers' sentiment is becoming more and more firm, and users' silk sales are also gradually stabilizing. The foreign price limit for American Chuang white filature silk of grades 7 and 8 is still 655 yuan. Judging from the market atmosphere a few days ago, it seems to be too low, so yesterday's foreign Chuang silk transactions were not strong. Chinese and foreign silk merchants are now watching and waiting for the rise and fall of the New York market tomorrow to determine their buying and selling. Yesterday, a total of 203 bales were transacted in the whole city, and white filature, grey filature, and Sichuan filature all had considerable sales, and the market may continue to be firm.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>The city is a melting pot of human life. All the skyscrapers, foreign houses, cars, criminal courts, police, exchanges, clubs, dance halls, brothels, red pill sales offices, large gambling dens, etc... it has created people, and it has also killed people. It is hated by people, but it is also praised by people.</p>
<p>The countryside is the source of human life materials. All the rice grains, wheat, vegetables, fruits, silk, cotton, etc. come from this place. It provides food and clothing for all mankind. It is the foundation of human life, but now it is plagued by famine everywhere, and it is even forgotten by the people in the city.</p>
<p>We are fantasizing that one day, we will coordinate and harmonize the symphony of steel, steam, and electricity in the city with everything in the countryside, fundamentally eliminate all the drunkenness, singing, and licentiousness in the city, and completely eliminate all the hunger and cold wastelands in the countryside.</p>
<p>Humanity will begin to live a new and happy life!</p>
<h3>Record After Visiting the Family Prototype Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Shu Fan</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Shaofu of Wumen loved skillful crafts during his lifetime. He often studied the art of carving wood and sharpening pits for pleasure. He also liked to travel extensively. When he was a guest in Chengdu, he once saw a set of aprons woven from human bones, inlaid with pearls and emeralds, and as wonderful as brocade weaving. He was delighted with the divine skills of ancient Chinese craftsmanship, which were unattainable. After returning, he increasingly closed his doors and explored, creating in various ways. Later, he felt that it was useless to carve magpies, and it would be easier to make cars and axles for people to understand. So he recruited several craftsmen to work hard for years to supervise the production of household daily utensils, lifelike and carefully imitating the essence. Therefore, within the square area, everything from beds and bedding to tables and cases, calligraphy and paintings, cups and plates, down to dust brooms and chamber pots, could be displayed without leaving anything out. In 1933, he held a pre-exhibition at the Chicago Exposition and won an excellent award certificate. Soon after, Mr. donated the pavilion, and all these wonderful constructions were consigned to dust. Now, his son, Leshan, has slightly reorganized and displayed them all on the fourth floor of Daxin. I have admired them for a long time, and yesterday I was informed that I could enjoy them. They are classified into seven categories: The ancestral hall, where sacrificial vessels are most prominent. The boudoir, where even small items such as jewel boxes are displayed. The hall and the funeral ceremonies are equipped with tools for answering questions and expressing condolences. The Daoist altar and the yacht display the music of Luosheng's banquet and gambling. The school kitchen room is filled with steamers, pots, knives, and chopsticks, which are especially wonderful as if the servants were personally serving. The people sitting, lying, walking, and talking in it are all like their shapes. They are all less than a foot in size, but they are perfectly matched with bean cups and palm tables. Moreover, when carefully examining ceramics, gold, and stone, the inscriptions and engravings are all real. The exquisite craftsmanship of the small objects is amazing. According to the person in charge, the kitchen used to have a cured ham, which was taken from the belly of a pregnant pig, cut off and then made by Dongbai people with potassium nitrate. It was stolen in the farming year, and it is still deeply regretted. In addition, a Daoist scripture in the Daoist altar, with ink as thin as a fly's foot, was also tampered with. To this day, it is difficult to find a skilled hand to fill it. Therefore, I immediately used Lai Zixin as a medium, and Zixin's calligraphy has the skill of placing Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed. I hope that it can complete this wonderful product.</p>
<h3>Booksellers' Words</h3>
<p>— Tiao Kuang</p>
<p>In order to buy a few books, I happened to walk to Fourth Horse Road and stepped into a Qiming Bookstore. Seeing that their scale was not very large, but it was arranged in a very orderly manner, and the staff was also very friendly; so everyone started talking. In this conversation, there seemed to be a few points that were worth recording!</p>
<p>"Your books are sold so cheaply, isn't this a disguised form of books discounted at 20% off?" I asked.</p>
<p>"It is indeed; but the direction we are taking is different: we do not approve of reprinting those boring novels, but want to promote some new literature; so in this first batch of 30 books issued, which one is not a world literary masterpiece! --What Little Women, Sentimental Education,... a few better books are all included! In addition, there is also a new literary publication, with original novels, dramas, and poems, all of which almost encompass the famous works of recent people!" A young clerk answered as if he were counting family treasures.</p>
<p>"That's very good; then the cost must be very high?"</p>
<p>"The cost is certainly higher; this is not the same as reprinting those boring novels, just taking them and printing them--but we also have our own methods."</p>
<p>"What methods?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing more than reducing expenses to the lowest possible level;" he replied with a smile, "Fortunately, everyone here is young, holding a brave heart, rushing straight forward, how the treatment is, how the working hours are, are not in our hearts, thinking that as long as we do this, we will definitely get a very good result!" He was very generous in guiding here.</p>
<p>"You are willing to do this with all your heart and soul, I think business must be very good?" I couldn't help but compliment him.</p>
<p>"Business is indeed not bad; it's just that because the cost is relatively large and the pricing is low, for example, people can recoup their costs by buying 1,000 copies, but we have to add several times that!—However, we are willing to do this, because at least on the buyer's side, they must be very sympathetic to us!"</p>
<p>I withdrew and thought carefully about this answer, and felt that although there were some elements of self-promotion in it; however, in this era of fierce commercial warfare, this is not a new invention of a business eye, which can be shown to other stores as an example! Therefore, I record it on the right.</p>
<h3>Shanghai People's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Jiang Gong</p>
<p>"It takes three generations of officials to understand how to dress and eat." This saying shows that in the past, studying beautiful clothes was limited to aristocratic families. Now, it is very different.</p>
<p>In Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, especially in the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas, wearing silk and satin is very common and ordinary, but elsewhere, it is considered a remarkable thing. I remember when I was young and living in Wuchang, I saw with my own eyes that except for officials and wealthy merchants, people rarely wore silk fabrics unless there were weddings, funerals, celebrations, or important banquets. Even wealthy young men, until they were around twenty years old, would be criticized behind their backs for occasionally wearing a fur coat, with people saying, "Aren't they afraid of burning their tender bones!" Even in Beijing, although it has been the capital for many dynasties, the customs of the people were similar. People from places like Shanxi and Shaanxi, who are known for their frugal nature, need no further mention. Look at many important figures from the Northwest, who, despite being in positions of wealth and honor, still wear coarse cloth clothes year-round. This is just their way of doing things and not intentional affectation. The difference between the extravagance and frugality of the North and South is truly immeasurable!</p>
<p>Shanghai people admire vanity the most and love to decorate their appearance. Regardless of their own circumstances or financial resources, they only focus on their clothing, striving to dress themselves in splendid attire, as if they are getting married every day, and everyone is a handsome young man. Even small shop assistants who only earn a dozen yuan a month, poor workers and tea servants, and unemployed vagrants who wander around all day, wear silk from head to toe, inside and out, from their undershirts to the linings of their lined clothes. They would rather go without food than without new clothes, and are willing to borrow money and commit fraud, engage in dishonorable behavior, add to their mental suffering, or even face legal sanctions, all without much care or consideration. "Since ancient times, greedy men have died for wealth, and heroes have died for fame," but Shanghai people only know how to die for clothes. Truly, one crab is worse than another!</p>
<p>However, their policy may be out of necessity, which is not wrong at all. People who want to live in Shanghai really have to do this. Because Shanghai has many vulgar people who are very snobbish and superficial, and they only judge people by their clothes. If you don't have any valuable clothes on, they will look down on you and despise you as worthless!</p>
<p>Common sayings describe people who "swell their faces to look fat" with the phrase "what they wear is on their body, and what they eat is in their belly." But now, Shanghai people are almost the opposite; you could say that "what they eat is on their body, and what they wear is in their belly!" If men are like this, one can imagine what women are like. (According to the news, a young woman committed suicide out of grief because she couldn't get new clothes. This is truly a modern martyr, willing to die for clothes, and her death is heavier than Mount Tai!)</p>
<p>However, in the past few years, new styles of clothing fabrics often sold for four or five yuan a foot, and people still rushed to buy them. Recently, silk and satin have become extremely cheap, and various stores are competing to attract customers with slogans of "unwilling to lose their shirts" and "painful sacrifices." Sacrifice items are sold for only a few cents per foot, but there are few people ordering new clothes. This is not because Shanghai people's enthusiasm for clothing has suddenly decreased. The biggest reason is probably that the public's finances are exhausted and have reached the final stage of "robbing Peter to pay Paul!"</p>

<p>Chapter 7: Brotherly Love Hides a Letter Pitying the Weak Sister; Bookish Air Enters the Shadow, Laughing at the Poor Scholar</p>
<p>Youmei put down her umbrella and sat sideways on a bamboo chair, keeping an eye on Guoguo and Yan Zili. She chatted with Aunt Zhang for a while, but didn't hear any sounds from that room, not even the buzzing of mosquitoes. She thought that Guoguo must not be home. Just then, the maid brought a cup of chrysanthemum tea in a dark green porcelain cup. Youmei took a sip and saw the double dragons playing with pearls on the cup, so she smiled and said, "This must be something Cousin uses. A common person like me would only ruin such an elegant thing." Aunt Zhang sat on the rattan chair opposite her, first glanced at the doorway, then smiled and said to Youmei, "Although he likes everything to be clean and tidy, he doesn't draw any boundaries with people. We only have one bowl of rice to eat now. We were even poorer before, so we really can't afford to look down on anyone, Miss Li, don't you think?" Youmei said, "Of course. Cousin is not only a very good person, but his writing is also so admirable. For example, our classmates see his writing in magazines and discuss him a lot. Some guess correctly, some guess incorrectly, and I find it funny. One person is simply a faithful follower. As long as a magazine has Cousin's writing in it, he will definitely buy it to read." As she said this, there was a "clang" sound from the room. It was clearly the sound of a copper ruler falling on the Xuan paper. Youmei was startled and said, "What? Is Cousin home?" Then she smiled slightly. Aunt Zhang laughed and said, "It doesn't matter if he's home, you didn't say anything bad about him. Don't think that he's been to modern schools since he was young, but he can't be fashionable. He's very generous with men, but he's more timid with women than a girl meeting a man." As Youmei spoke to Aunt Zhang, she looked at the doorway several times and saw a white shadow flickering. She called out, "Cousin is working hard at home! Without your permission, I can't just come into the study to visit." Guoguo replied from inside the room, "I'm sorry. I'm rushing to finish a manuscript, and I'll come out to accompany you when I'm done." Youmei said, "Please do as you please. I'm not a guest, and I have Auntie here to keep me company." Then she turned to Aunt Zhang and whispered, "In this hot weather, he's still shutting himself in his room and being so bookish. He's a bit too steeped in poetry and books." As she spoke, she frowned and smiled wryly. Aunt Zhang laughed and said, "He shouldn't be like this, I always say he's a bookworm." (88)</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Autumn</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiba</p>
<p>I moved to Caojing over a year ago, and I've been gradually seeing less of my friends in Shanghai. Recently, I've been assisting Mr. Ping, so I've been bustling back and forth between Jing'an and Caojing every day. I happened to realize that the residence of my close friend, Mr. Hu Wenqing, was nearby, so I paid him a visit after work.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu has been managing the Shengde Weaving Factory for many years. He is shrewd, capable, and willing to take responsibility, and is highly relied upon by Mr. Gu Zhaozhen, the factory's owner. Mr. Gu, a native of Suzhou, started a lace business in the downtown area more than twenty years ago. During the European War, foreign goods were cut off, so he raised capital to establish Shengde. Through hard work and careful management, the factory's products became exquisite and sold throughout the country and Southeast Asia within a few years. He further expanded the factory, building a factory base of more than twenty acres on Xiaoshadu Road and adding large-scale machinery, which sped up production and improved quality. It has brought new glory to the national manufacturing industry. The lace produced is constantly updated with new patterns and is even superior to imported goods. Its Sazhen products can also manufacture their own raw materials and distribute them to the Lingzhi Bakelite Instrument Factory, resulting in doubled profits.</p>
<p>In recent years, the market has been sluggish, and the factory has also been affected, but its foundation is solid and it is still able to maintain itself. Recently (starting from October 1st, for a month, as is the usual practice), it held a 22nd-anniversary exhibition to commemorate the founding of the factory. It opened a large room to display various products and offered large discounts to commemorate the occasion. This year, it also cooperated with the Mei Ya Silk Weaving Factory to set up displays so that customers could purchase new and unique lace patterns without having to go to the trouble of matching materials. Yesterday, when I visited Mr. Hu, he took me to visit the exhibition hall in the factory. The electric lights were bright, and the colors of the flowers were brilliant. I couldn't take it all in. Among them, the needle department includes weaving, lace weaving, dyeing and other departments, which are managed by Mr. Hu. There is also a Sazhen department, which is a pioneer in the domestic light industry, managed by Mr. Li, also a native of Suzhou. The various bakelite utensils produced are colorful and numerous, and cannot be described in detail. Although the news of the incident had not subsided when I visited, there were still many visitors, especially to see the newly released "Mandarin Duck Lace," which is popular among fashionable partners to trim and embellish their clothes, giving them a unique charm. It is suitable for sales between...</p>
<p>In this time of national crisis, looking at the factories in the country, there are only a few that can manufacture their own raw materials to resist imports. Shengde can stand out and sell more than one million worth of goods a year, which has attracted the attention of foreigners. I hope that those with a will will rise up and revitalize the industry, so I am happy to write about it.</p>
<h3>"Salty Water Girl" is a Transliteration</h3>
<p>— (Guo Zhenfang)</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper said that "salty water girls" are called that because "seawater is salty, and they are doing business at sea, so they are called salty water girls." Although it seems reasonable, it feels like a far-fetched explanation.</p>
<p>As far as I know, "salty water girl" is a transliteration of "Handsome Maid," just like "Delüfeng" (telephone), "Madaka" (car), "Selao Fu" (traveling salesman), and "Kangbaidu" (comprador). It should not be interpreted literally, otherwise, you will get stuck in a dead end.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>In the International Cemetery</h3>
<p>— Xiafei</p>
<p>Suddenly, I don't know what kind of idea entered my quiet and lonely heart, letting my body drift like a fallen leaf in the autumn wind, aimlessly drifting.</p>
<p>The city under the setting sun is like a magnificent and beautiful oil painting. The arteries of the metropolis are tense and trembling with the heartstrings of the people. On the streets, those people carrying crosses are struggling in this torrent of life as if they have lost their souls!</p>
<p>Many trams, cars, and buses are circling in front of Jing'an Temple like fish in a pond. The three-dimensional architecture and the spiderweb-like wires have already indicated to me that this place has also raised the banner of a prosperous city. Although there is still an ancient Jing'an Temple here, it has not diminished its modern dignity. Now, there are also live plays being performed, crimes being committed, streamlined cars, strugglers on the line of life, haughty gentlemen, unemployed people wandering the streets, rosy dreams, and gray stories... That is a cross-section of Eastern Paris, the edge of Eastern Monte Carlo.</p>
<p>Thinking and walking, I don't know how, by chance, I stumbled into the quiet and solemn International Cemetery.</p>
<p>It is a pure land for the final destination of life. What it suggests to people is only a sense of mystery and liberation. Although no one can avoid entering this final stage, whether they are heroes, beauties, sages, or famous scholars, in the end, they are nothing more than a piece of yellow earth and a pile of white bones. However, after hundreds of years, I think maybe even this piece of yellow earth and a pile of white bones will not be found! Therefore, I feel that setting up these mounds and stone tablets now is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Life is full of contradictions. Some people are always afraid of the arrival of death, but at the same time, some people who think they are smart are constantly digging their own graves. I don't know which of these people is the real fool?</p>
<p>The International Cemetery is a burial ground for people of all nationalities in Shanghai. I believe that the remains of our enemies and the souls of our friends must be buried under these crosses or stone tablets. However, although I have often passed by here before, I have never paid attention to it. Today, I actually stumbled into this place, which is truly a miracle beyond my own expectations.</p>
<p>I love this place very much because it is not only quiet and solemn, but also has extremely elegant and beautiful scenery. The green shade covers the sky, and the soft grass is like a carpet, which makes people linger. Although it is not as well-arranged as a park, with ponds, pavilions, and neatly trimmed flower beds, when we are in it, we can experience a different kind of feeling.</p>
<p>This place is very large, with many stone tablets and crosses standing vertically and horizontally, recording the names of the people. Next to each tomb is a rectangular stone plate filled with pebbles. Some flowers are placed in front of each tomb, and small paths are left on all sides for people to walk. The lush trees are arranged on the sides of the sidewalks, and many unnamed wildflowers are lonely adorned in the middle. In the slanting sunlight and twilight, this group of tombs looks even more desolate and dim.</p>
<p>Walking here alone, I am reminded of the emptiness of life, aware of the loneliness of disillusionment, and it evokes my detached and transcendent view of life. A faint sorrow covers my consciousness like the autumn chill.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a flock of sparrows flew from the trees, chirping and flying among the branches, full of harmonious and joyful air, which suddenly cracked the solidified solemnity. They are so lively and free, but we humans, who claim to be the soul of all things, have lost our freedom and liveliness everywhere, and only groan and moan under the heavy pressure of pain. Thinking about it, isn't it embarrassing!</p>
<p>The heavy evening dew is gradually lowering, and the last ray of sunlight has been retracted from the spire of the Cathedral of the Holy Mother. Therefore, I also had to quietly embark on the road home with a wistful heart.</p>

<h3>The Greatest Crisis in China Today!</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>The situation China is in today is such that the severity of the crisis cannot be described in words. Externally, Eastern tigers and Western wolves, powerful neighbors are pressing in. Internally, natural disasters and banditry, everywhere is scarred and battered. It is just like a small boat drifting in the midst of terrifying waves, constantly in danger of capsizing. However, the perilous state of the country, though a great tragedy, is not the greatest affliction of our Chinese nation. Rather, the weakness of our people's bodies is the greatest crisis.</p>
<p>The country is a collective body of people. If the individuals that make up the country are strong in quality, then even if the organization of the country is destroyed, we still have the possibility of reorganizing it. But if the bodies of the people are weak, first there will be a loss of spirit and an apathetic attitude, followed by the onset of various diseases and a lingering existence. In such a situation, the nation's productivity will sharply decline, and the death rate will sharply increase. If this continues, then we will not be able to handle difficult tasks in the present, and we will surely perish day by day in the future.</p>
<p>The decline of the physique of our country's people has gradually worsened, especially in recent years. Looking at the failures of our country's representatives at the current World Games, half of them are due to a lack of physical strength. This alone is enough to give us deep attention and reflection. If we examine today's schools, there are many students who are sick. One school conducted a health check and found that the sick and unhealthy accounted for 80% of the students, while the healthy and disease-free accounted for only 20%. If the health ratio of students in all schools in the country is the same as in this school, then most of the young people are weak. Then China's future is in danger. If we extrapolate from the surface, more than half of China's 400 million people will be sick and weak. What is the danger to the nation's future?</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we examine the office workers in various institutions, most show signs of mental and physical decline and low vitality. Such weak people are very easily fatigued when serving, and in less than a few hours, they feel dizzy, have blurred vision, and have sore backs. Therefore, their spirits are flagging, they procrastinate in their duties, are absent from work, and their efficiency is greatly reduced. Furthermore, if we stand on the side of a thoroughfare and carefully observe the passersby, most are yellow-faced, thin, and weak. Among them, there are very few who are physically strong and mentally healthy. If this is the case, it will be truly difficult for our country, a country organized by a weak nation, to resist foreign enemies. Therefore, today's danger to China is not the fear of foreign insults, nor the worry of disasters, but the weakness of our physique, which is the greatest concern. In general, those who are mentally unhealthy will have weak wisdom and declining spirits. Therefore, the virtue of courage will also be almost completely extinguished. From this point of view, we can know the crux of the relationship between the country's strength and weakness and the nation's survival and demise.</p>
<h3>Cultivating Health</h3>
<p>To increase the vitality of the nerves and promote general health and vitality, the first thing is to cultivate the spirit, avoid overwork of the mind and body, have a regular life, go to bed early and wake up early, rub the body with cold water, do appropriate exercises outdoors, avoid all exciting substances, regulate bowel movements, and restrain sexual activity to prevent excess. Those who have bad habits such as masturbation should also quit. In addition, nerve tonics should also be taken at the same time to quickly recover and restore health.</p>
<p>Our spirit and physical strength are produced by the brain. If we want to strengthen our nerves and our physical health, we must nourish our brain. Because the brain is the hub of all nerves - if one is healthy, all are healthy; if one is weak, all are weak - so nourishing the brain is the foundation for strengthening the nerves, and it is also the key to eliminating weakness and strengthening the whole body and mind. According to the experimental reports of doctors from various countries, the "Mimer Brain Tonic" Memory Neuralic of German Keong Ke Biological Pharmaceutical Company is the most effective for such drugs that strengthen and nourish the nerves. It is effective for various symptoms of neurasthenia such as headache, brain swelling, dizziness, forgetfulness, insomnia, weak memory, sluggish thinking, and mental fatigue. After taking it, patients immediately feel clear-headed, have agile thoughts, are mentally happy, are physically strong, and have doubled vitality - as if a withered tree has gained sweet rain and grown vigorously. Therefore, doctors around the world unanimously praise "Mimer Brain Tonic" as a source of health. If the people of our country want to go from weak to strong, then taking this medicine regularly is suitable.</p>
<h3>Record of Experiments on Rooting Out Asthma</h3>
<p>— (British Asthma Treatment Monthly) DR.A.BERT. Report Translated by Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Asthma, also known as bronchial asthma, is commonly called phlegm drinking. This symptom has been difficult to treat since ancient times. Although modern medicine is prosperous, there is still no effective medicine for radical cure. Most of the various asthma medicines sold in the market contain anesthetic effects, which are only effective for a while. There is actually no possibility of radical cure, and such drugs should not be used frequently. If taken every time it occurs, it will often lead to addiction, so it is not a safe treatment. I have been in clinical practice for many years. When I encounter this disease, I only use symptomatic treatment. It is extremely difficult to apply radical treatment.</p>
<p>Since Dr. HumbertM.D. of Germany invented the endocrine combined asthma medicine Holipin, the entire European medical community has been competing to adopt it and has published articles in magazines and newspapers to introduce it. They all praised and recognized (Xiaoli Ping) as a radical cure for asthma. Therefore, I also used it accordingly. Over the years, I have treated no less than 200 asthma patients in clinical practice, and the results have been very satisfactory. Now, in my spare time, I have extracted one example on the left.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. B.W., 47 years old (hardware industry)</p>
<p>(Chief Complaint) The body is weak and usually has a lot of phlegm. He is prone to catching a cold. Since the autumn of the year before last, he suddenly developed asthma. In the beginning, it occurred once every two or three months. Until the winter of last year, the condition worsened, and it occurred once or twice a month, and the time was prolonged, and the suffering was even greater.</p>
<p>(Symptoms) The onset time is often in the middle of the night. Suddenly, there is difficulty breathing. The breath is obstructed and astringent. You cannot go to bed. You have to sit or stand to relieve your breath. The face is pale and cyanotic. The snoring is like a flute sound, and the sound is very high. You can hear it if you are close. At the beginning of the attack, the cough is not very obvious. After four or five days, the difficulty breathing gradually eases. Then, there is more coughing, and thick, clear phlegm is coughed up. The symptoms are relieved and return to normal.</p>
<p>(Diagnosis) Bronchial asthma</p>
<p>(Treatment) Strictly abide by general health care methods. Take Holipin (Xiaoli Ping) three tablets at a time when it occurs. In about ten minutes, the symptoms will be relieved. Two hours later, take another three tablets, and you will feel that the phlegm is thin and loose, and the difficulty breathing will be completely returned. He then returned to a healthy state. From then on, during the intermittent period, take two tablets three times a day. After three months of continuous treatment, he was cured. And it has been more than half a year since then, and it has not recurred. From this, we can know that (Xiaoli Ping) can indeed eradicate asthma and is not false.</p>
<h3>Irregular Menstruation Prevents Conception</h3>
<p>— Female Doctor Chen Hezhen</p>
<p>The way to give birth begins with seeking children. The way to seek children begins with regulating menstruation. It is often seen that women who do not have children must have irregular menstruation, either early or late, too much or too little, purple or black, light or congealed. If it is not regulated, the qi and blood will be deficient, and conception will not be possible.</p>
<p>Based on our clinical experience, the most commonly used drug is "Minu Ning" Mencrrin. This product is a sacred medicine for the treatment of irregular menstruation. It has been proven by clinical trials by various doctors that it has the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting fertility, activating blood and replenishing blood, and it works quickly. Women, whether sick or not, can take it to maintain health and beauty, and youth can be preserved forever.</p>
<h3>How Can Young Men and Women Relieve Inner Anxiety?</h3>
<p>— Dr. G. Courteble, translated by Dr. Fang Shitong</p>
<p>When tender green leaves sprout, hidden within the hearts of vibrant youth lie troubles unknown to others... anxieties torment them day and night. The greatest distress for these vigorous young people is likely the dysfunction of their reproductive organs! What is reproductive organ dysfunction? In men, it often manifests as a small penis, testicular atrophy, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, and other symptoms. In women, it appears as abnormal libido, lack of pleasure, pain during intercourse, and irregular menstruation (abdominal pain before and after menstruation, periods that are either early or late, excessive or insufficient menstrual flow, or even amenorrhea), as well as frequent leukorrhea. Regardless of which partner suffers from reproductive organ dysfunction, the result is certain to shatter their family's happiness and lead to various tragedies...</p>
<p>Those suffering from reproductive organ dysfunction also experience severe mental anxiety, constant distress, depression, low spirits, and diminished energy. This gradually leads to a state of severe neurasthenia, with symptoms such as head heaviness, dizziness, headaches, insomnia, tinnitus, fatigue, memory loss, mental unease, and lower back pain. In short, they become a person plagued by a hundred ailments—a lifeless invalid. Most who suffer from reproductive organ dysfunction are inherently weak and nervous individuals. The main reason for this is excessive masturbation, whether male or female, leading to this unfortunate condition. Others develop this condition due to excessive sexual activity, after suffering from venereal disease, or due to excessive physical and mental exertion.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of reproductive organ dysfunction, according to the experience of various specialists, to restore male reproductive function, it is advisable to take the German endocrine preparation "Wel Tonic," which strengthens the kidneys and invigorates essence. Its efficacy is outstanding. For female dysfunction and menstrual irregularities, it is advisable to take "Menorrin," which can restore sexual function to health, normalize menstruation, invigorate qi and blood, and maintain a healthy and beautiful state. These are the two medicines most recommended by doctors worldwide for treating reproductive organ dysfunction in both men and women, with surprising results. By taking them for a sufficient period according to their specific condition, the functional impairments can be eliminated, naturally enabling normal marital sexual life.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia—is a demon that destroys our vitality; in treatment, it should be considered as important as reproductive organ dysfunction. Therefore, when treating reproductive organ dysfunction, it is essential to simultaneously use tonics that strengthen the nerves. Doctors in various countries recommend "Mennory Neurotic," which has the authority to turn weakness into strength. This preparation is suitable for both men and women. Regular use for two to three weeks will show remarkable results: enhanced spirit, doubled energy, clear mind, pleasant intellect, agile thinking, increased appetite, and a natural restoration of overall health. From then on, inner anxiety is relieved, and one can once again enjoy the happiness and pleasure of life.</p>
<p>Lecture on Lung Disease</p>
<p>— Written by Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<h3>Winter is a Good Time to Treat Lung Diseases</h3>
<p>There is a common misconception that winter is not suitable for treating lung diseases. In fact, winter is a good time for recuperation because the characteristics of the winter climate—coolness, dryness, and a smaller difference between day and night temperatures—are all beneficial for recovery. Reports from sanatoriums in cold Northern Europe show that the best results in treating lung diseases are achieved in winter.</p>
<p>Adjusting clothing and practicing various strengthening exercises can avoid the cold and prevent colds. The cool and dry air can enhance the body's vitality, so appetite often improves in winter. Patients should not miss this naturally good time to thoroughly implement various recuperation methods. Those who practice economical self-care at home can also use the organ-derived "Phith Weal" for a more reasonable approach. It is not advisable to randomly use other calcium preparations or chemical drugs, as their efficacy is weak and their side effects are greater. The organ-derived preparation "Phith Weal" is based on [sound principles] and is safe and recognized.</p>
<p>During this period, patients who take the organ-derived preparation "Phith Weal" and recuperate peacefully can turn a progressive condition into a stable one, reduce fever, lessen cough and sputum, improve appetite, elevate mood, gain weight, strengthen lung capacity, and boost resistance. The tuberculosis bacteria will eventually be overcome by the body's natural strength, leading to recovery. Furthermore, the effects of taking "Phith Weal" during winter recuperation are particularly evident and rapid, leading to a natural and fundamental cure. Patients should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>Many scholars worldwide believe that lung disease is not merely a simple bacterial disease but also a nervous disease. While this may be an exaggeration, lung disease patients do exhibit symptoms of hypersensitivity and neurasthenia. The reasons for this are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Many lung disease patients develop neurasthenia due to nocturnal emission, masturbation, or excessive sexual activity before developing a fever, leading to lung disease. Therefore, lung disease and neurasthenia are closely related.</p>
<p>(2) Tuberculous toxins can damage the nerves and impair brain nutrition, easily causing neurasthenic symptoms.</p>
<p>(3) Suffering from lung disease can cause mental distress, leading to fear of death, loneliness, and sadness, ultimately resulting in neurasthenia.</p>
<p>(4) Insufficient funds for recuperation and other material anxieties can cause physical and mental exhaustion, leading to neurasthenia.</p>
<p>(5) Lung disease patients often face cold and cruel treatment from society, easily leading to resentment and neurasthenia.</p>
<p>In summary, the treatment methods for lung disease are entirely the same: eliminating previous bad habits in both mental and physical aspects and practicing self-cultivation to implement a lifestyle revolution. For neurasthenia caused by the first reason mentioned above, if nocturnal emission has not been cured, "Fonan" pills should be taken to stop the leakage. For those who masturbate or engage in excessive sexual activity, "Well Tonic," which tonifies the kidneys and strengthens essence, should be taken internally to nourish yin, tonify the kidneys, increase vitality, and restore weakness. For neurasthenia caused by tuberculous toxins as described in the second point, fundamental treatment must be implemented, such as taking "Phith Weal" to stop the progression of the disease and eliminate tuberculosis bacteria. For neurasthenia caused by the third, fourth, and fifth points mentioned above, attention must be paid to self-cultivation, making efforts to overcome and avoid adverse mental influences, which is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>According to recent experiments by scholars, most lung disease patients, regardless of the severity, exhibit neurasthenic symptoms such as head heaviness, headache, dizziness, forgetfulness, and insomnia. Therefore, in addition to taking the root-treating medicine "Phith Weai," nerve tonics should also be used simultaneously. "Memory Neurolic" is particularly effective. Therefore, those who take tonics for lung disease nowadays have abandoned cod liver oil, iron, phosphorus, calcium, and other supplements and instead unanimously take the nerve tonic "Memory Neurolic," which can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Lung Disease and Cough with Sputum</h3>
<p>—The Danger of Abusing Antitussives—</p>
<p>What is sputum? It is the secretion from the affected area, i.e., the pus of pulmonary tuberculosis. This pus contains numerous tuberculosis bacteria (also known as tubercle bacilli). If it remains in the alveoli without being coughed out, there is a risk of further spreading the disease.</p>
<p>The inner lining of the trachea has ciliated epithelial cells with brush-like cilia. The movement of these cilia can naturally push out a small amount of sputum in the trachea. However, it is quite difficult to do so when there is a large amount of sputum, especially the sputum produced by the tuberculous lesion, which is very sticky. The force of the ciliary movement alone cannot completely remove it. Therefore, there must be a method to expel this sticky sputum, which is why coughing occurs. Therefore, the act of coughing is beneficial in physiologically defending against harmful sputum in the body. If it is a mild cough, it is a natural and beneficial self-defense mechanism. However, if patients abuse antitussive medications, forcibly suppressing the cough and hindering its self-defense function, it is actually harmful. Therefore, it is quite inappropriate for lung disease patients to abuse antitussive medications.</p>
<p>The nature of the sputum: white, thin sputum is mostly secreted from the trachea; thick, yellowish-brown sputum can be considered to be produced by the tuberculous lesion. During the recovery process, the natural reduction of sputum indicates that the pus is gradually decreasing, and the disease is gradually lessening. The change from thick sputum to thin sputum, from yellowish-brown pus to white, thin sputum, also indicates that the disease is subsiding. In general, the decrease in sputum and the disappearance of purulent sputum naturally reduce coughing, which also indicates a reduction in the disease. From this perspective, the presence of sputum in recovering patients indicates that the disease has not yet stopped. While coughing is present, it is clear that tuberculosis bacteria are still active. Thoroughly implementing rest and quiet in the air, along with internal administration of the organ-derived preparation "Phith Weal" according to the method, can quickly halt the progression of the disease. The cough can then disappear naturally without needing to be suppressed, which is the fundamental method of treatment.</p>
<h3>Saving Youth from Disease</h3>
<p>— Physician Chen Zhicheng</p>
<p>Among the diseases that afflict young people the most, none is more prevalent than sexually transmitted diseases. In particular, nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and testicular atrophy are very common. Not only does the body gradually weaken and the nerves steadily decline, but there is also the despair of losing offspring and a shortened lifespan. It is essential to seek treatment from a reputable and reliable physician as soon as possible. As for medication, extra attention is also required.</p>
<p>Physician Fang Shitong is skilled in treating sexually transmitted diseases and has extensive clinical experience with nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, and testicular atrophy. Those who have been diagnosed and treated by him are often cured and recover quickly. The effective remedies for sexually transmitted diseases that he frequently prescribes, such as "Fonan" pills and "Well Tonic," have gained early recognition and achieve the most satisfactory results. These medicines are sold at the Western medicine department of Wing On Company in Shanghai and at major pharmacies, as well as at major pharmacies nationwide.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Physician Fang Shitong holds consultations at the Shimin Sanatorium, located at the east end of North Zhejiang Road, at the intersection of Haining Road and Keneng Road in Shanghai. He provides consultations throughout the day and charges only two dimes. He is responsible for curing male and female sexual diseases, as well as venereal diseases and nicotine addiction.</p>

<h3>Research on Germ Warfare (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Li Lingdong</p>
<p>—Special Feature on the Eve of the World War</p>
<p>The international situation has returned to the eve of a violent and murderous world war. The smell of gunpowder has filled the olfactory organs of people all over the world. No one dares to deny that war is inevitable. Each imperialist is flexing its muscles, scheming, and striving to expand its military power. Weapons of murder are constantly being refined day and night in order to achieve the illusion of quickly annihilating the enemy and achieving final victory.</p>
<p>Future wars will shift from planar warfare to three-dimensional warfare. The sharp weapons of war have evolved from bows and arrows and cruisers, etc. to places where shells arrive, causing the earth to collapse and objects to shatter. In the realm of aircraft attacks, blood and flesh fly horizontally. The cruelty and grief have reached the point where it is unbearable to hear and see. What is even more terrifying is that the imperialists are ambitious and unprincipled. The sharpness and ferocity of all killing tools make people stunned and talk about tigers as if they were changing color. Therefore, the use of brutal, inhumane, and inhuman poisonous gas warfare and germ warfare has followed one after another, shocking the world. In the blink of an eye, corpses can be seen everywhere and all the fields are destroyed. The cruelty of the murderous power makes people feel cold and frightened. Since germ warfare and poisonous gas warfare are so important in future wars, let us now take a look at germ warfare.</p>
<p>Although germ warfare is brutal and inhumane, it has never been used in past wars. Its first experiment was at the end of the First World War. At that time, the German army cultivated a kind of glanders bacteria in the German embassy in Bucharest, hoping to use it on the Romanian cavalry. In addition, cholera bacteria were cultivated in the Consulate General of Zurich, Switzerland, with the intention of spreading them within the Russian territory. However, before they could be used, the Russian Tsarist army had collapsed and disintegrated. The Consul General wanted to throw them into the river to destroy the evidence, but was secretly reported by the gatekeeper and discovered. This is the sensational Zurich germ bomb incident in the world, and it is also the beginning of the history of germ warfare.</p>
<p>Bacteria are the source of disease and the enemy of mankind. However, the bacteria used in war are mostly statutory infectious diseases, or spores that are not easily destroyed, and various pyogenic bacteria, such as cholera, typhoid fever, plague, whooping cough, cold, dysentery, tetanus, erysipelas, tuberculosis, typhus, relapsing fever, glanders bacteria, streptococcus, rabies, and the original bacteria of various pyogenic diseases.</p>
<p>If we want to study germ warfare, the basic approach must be to first know the morphology, living properties, and reproduction of various bacteria, as well as the methods of cultivation. On the one hand, we can manufacture sharp weapons in germ warfare to annihilate the enemy, defend the country’s territory, and realize world peace. On the other hand, if the enemy uses bacteria to attack us, we can also know how to defend against and destroy the harm of bacteria, so that germ warfare cannot show its power within our country.</p>
<p>The implementation of germ warfare is not an easy task. There must be suitable air pressure, temperature, and humidity for the bacteria to exert their fierce power and unfold their violence in a good environment in the air, in food, in the soil and in water. When experimenting with the transmission of cholera, if there is a good environment, the mortality rate can reach 60%, that is, 60 out of 100 people suffering from cholera are killed by cholera bacteria.</p>
<p>The methods of attack that various countries are expecting in germ warfare are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Contamination of drinking water, such as throwing typhoid bacteria, cholera bacteria, dysentery bacteria, tuberculosis bacteria, E. coli, etc. into the drinking water. Is water something that people cannot live without for a day? Sixty percent of the body tissue is composed of water. Since the relationship between water and humans is so close, if the water contains germs, the transmission of diseases is very close, and people’s lives are in a state of "no guarantee in the morning and evening." The number of deaths is shockingly terrifying.</p>
<p>(2) Use rodents and other animals and insects, such as cultivating fleas, lice, bedbugs, etc., to spread germs to the enemy and drive away rabid dogs to bite people, so that plague, typhus, rabies, etc. will continue to occur.</p>
<p>(3) Smear tetanus bacteria, erysipelas bacteria, streptococcus, and various pyogenic bacteria on weapons or fill them in bullets and shoot them at the enemy.</p>
<p>(4) Store the cultured and propagated bacteria in volumetric containers, drop them from airplanes, and fill the air and drinking water with cold germs, whooping cough, and tuberculosis bacteria.</p>
<p>(5) Bury glanders, tetanus, and malignant edema bacteria in the mud. Once we come into contact with them, we will suffer from this disease.</p>
<p>From the methods of implementing germ warfare attacks, we can know that air, land, drinking water, and food...etc. are all important media that can be used in germ warfare. People can be infected with the plague and lose their lives at any time and minute. Once an infectious disease occurs, the rate of spread is very fast and the number of deaths can be astonishing. It spreads from one person, one family, one village, one township, one city, or even one province to the whole country. For example, the plague spread in the three northeastern provinces, killing as many as 100,000 people in a few hours. Cholera was prevalent in the south in the 20th year of the Republic of China, and hundreds of thousands of people died within a few months. How frightening is this high level of mortality— Once bacteria are used in germ warfare practice, the power of the plague and the cruelty of the massacre will not only harm one country, but can spread to the whole world. If plagues occur all over the world, it will be the day when mankind is exterminated and the day when the earth disappears. Therefore, it can be said that the terror of germ warfare is greater than the ferocity of poisonous gas; because the application time of poisonous gas cannot last for a long time, and the destructive power is relatively limited. The effects of poisonous gas poisoning vary, and a certain poisonous gas has a certain hazard, but not other hazards. For example, mustard gas only has the harm of corroding the skin, and tear gas can only make people shed tears, and can only be harmed in its area, and will never spread to a very distant place. Therefore, the abhorrence and fear of germ warfare is known from this. We should urgently study germ warfare.</p>
<h3>Investigation Report on the Sanitary Conditions of Xiaoshi, Zhejiang (5)</h3>
<p>— Shen Songnian</p>
<p>(2) Education Level of the Populace</p>
<p>Xiaoshi District is the center of the county, and there are more literate people, but they still lack considerable knowledge of health. Whenever epidemics prevail, performing religious rituals becomes the only epidemic prevention method believed by the populace, even seeking divination and prescriptions from deities. Those who unfortunately die during this time are not attributed to negligence but rather blamed on fate. Aside from the authorities and a few medical professionals, no one steps forward to advocate for scientific epidemic prevention measures and methods. The difficulty in popularizing health education is evident from this. However, as members of the intellectual class and the medical profession, how much more effort should we make to rise up and promote its popularity!</p>
<p>(3) Evening Schools for the Populace</p>
<p>Aside from those affiliated with the People's Education Center, other schools have long been discontinued, mainly due to limited funding. The evening schools affiliated with the People's Education Center are performing well, but unfortunately, they have not gained widespread public trust. - This is, of course, due to the low level of public intelligence.</p>
<p>(4) Newspapers and Medical Journals</p>
<p>There are three local newspapers here: one is the Xiaoshi Commercial Daily, the oldest, run by Wu Yugeng, a member of the County Party Standing Committee. Its content focuses on commercial information, so it is quite popular among the local business community. Attached to this newspaper are two medical journals, one is the "Modern Medicine" edited by Xia Canglin of the Xiaoshi New Medical Research Society, and the other is the "Medical Trends" edited by Shen Songnian of the Xiaoshi Medical Affairs Improvement Society. The purpose of the society is to unite medical colleagues to improve Xiaoshi's medical affairs and seek health and happiness for the populace. Its mission is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Go to the Populace</p>
<p>We must practically go deep into the populace, striving for popularization in everything, taking promoting the health and happiness of the populace as the starting point, and summarizing to the broad road of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>(2) Improve Medical Ethics</p>
<p>In ancient times, the medical profession was willing to be classified among the three religions and nine streams, turning medical practice into a nomadic way of life, leading to the demise of medical ethics! We must promote the medical profession's awareness of respecting personality, so that national morality is highly praised.</p>
<p>(3) Discuss Academics</p>
<p>Academics are the public property of the world, and there is no distinction between boundaries or factions. As long as it is suitable for modern China, it is worthy of our research. We must hope to make progress. The medical journals published by the two societies are all periodicals, highly praised by local people, and regarded as the harbinger of health education, which is beneficial to the populace. However, the illiterate are ultimately difficult to educate, so the effectiveness is minimal.</p>
<p>The only medical journal in the "Xiaoshi Daily" is "Medicine and the Populace," edited by Xia Canglin, which was founded not long ago. The remaining Xiaoshi Morning News has the smallest format, only four pages, and has no medical journal, so there is no need to describe it.</p>
<p>(5) The Rudimentary State of Health Education</p>
<p>Although the level of education here is more widespread than in remote areas, during this transitional era, although the movement to save the country through education has soared into the clouds, due to the low level of culture in our country and the fact that illiterates account for an absolute majority, health education here is also very poor! This is indeed the biggest key issue that makes it difficult to achieve the implementation of sanitary facilities in Xiaoshi.</p>
<p>(C) Regarding Medical Ethics</p>
<p>(1) Mutual Strife</p>
<p>The medical community here has factions such as German, British, American, etc. in the new medical field. Due to having received considerable education, they all maintain contact with each other, and there are few private opinions of factions. However, non-formal, counterfeit scientific doctors are selfish and always making trouble, which is the biggest fatal injury that makes it difficult for scientific medicine to develop widely! In the old medical field, there are often incidents of mutual strife, taking destroying the reputation of colleagues as a skill, specializing in intercepting business behind people's backs, and completely exposing unethical behavior, which is indeed a sign of impending demise; of course, there are also exceptions, but there are very few who truly abide by medical ethics.</p>
<p>(2) Unwilling to Take Responsibility</p>
<p>The medical community is unwilling to take responsibility, which is indeed a common problem in the medical community, and there are naturally exceptions. Since the safety of people's lives has not been adequately guaranteed, it is truly not the fortune of the country and the nation. Because the medical community is unwilling to take responsibility, it can only seek profit, gaining both fame and fortune, but it has lost the original intention of medicine as a benevolent art.</p>
<p>(3) Not Responding to Calls Promptly</p>
<p>Some doctors often like to delay responding to people's invitations for no reason. Even if their clinics are deserted, they still want to show off some stinky airs, delaying their departure for several hours, thinking that it can enhance their status. You must know that people's conditions change rapidly, how can you delay the moment and delay major events? "Although you didn't kill Boren, Boren died because of you." How can you bear it in your heart? Where is medical ethics?</p>
<p>(4) Mammonism</p>
<p>Money is omnipotent, but it is also the root of all evil. Doctors who have lost their humanity all take money as their purpose and treat human lives like child's play. For invitations from poor families, they often refuse to respond or do not come immediately due to the low pay, resulting in the loss of people's lives. Killing invisibly is a great sin. These doctors have obscured the dignity of the most noble free medical profession with its charitable nature.</p>
<p>(5) Turning Medical Practice into a Nomadic Way of Life</p>
<p>The medical profession was originally a most noble and charitable profession. The goal of medical practice should naturally be to relieve the suffering of all living beings and seek the health and happiness of the public, and to summarize to the broad road of national rejuvenation. It should never flow into a nomadic way of life, deceiving patients to achieve the purpose of making money and misleading the public. If this is the case, their personality has already degenerated, and they are no different from animals?</p>
<p>(D) Regarding Medical Law</p>
<p>(1) The Exclusive Establishment of Forensic Physicians</p>
<p>Forensic physicians are originally for the formal physicians to seek protection and a loud warning to the healthcare community. Regarding medical errors or misunderstandings of patients, standing on the medical position, based on the law, the judgment is without error, then we can talk about fairness. However, Xiaoshi does not have a forensic physician, so if there is a medical dispute, there will be endless malpractices, and perhaps doctors without errors will be wrongly implicated, while quack doctors will escape punishment, which is truly not the fortune of the populace, nor the fortune of society and the country!</p>
<p>(2) The Lack of Legal Knowledge in the Medical and Pharmaceutical Community</p>
<p>Law is originally for maintaining the common lives of human beings and for promoting the welfare of the public, so it should be followed by the public. The medical and pharmaceutical community is directly related to the safety of people's lives and indirectly related to the prosperity and decline of the country, so they should strictly abide by the law. However, many doctors and pharmacists often do not know legal knowledge, and there are countless people who mistakenly violate the law. This is indeed not the fortune of the medical and pharmaceutical community!</p>

<h3>Narrative of Li Kejia and Li Kejia Disease (4)</h3>
<p>— Chen Duanbai</p>
<p>The intracellular growth and proliferation of Li Kejia within blood vessels is an easily demonstrable fact in the course of epidemic typhus. Conversely, it is not easily demonstrable in the course of scrub typhus. The existence of Li Kejia in other cells or tissues, due to staining difficulties, still lacks a definitive method of judgment. In blood smear specimens and tissue section specimens, Li Kejia can be found, but the procedure is not easy. Based on personal experience, even with skin papules or testicular smears of experimental animals, if prepared one or two hours after the material is taken, it is difficult to stain and be detected. This shows that Li Kejia's ability to survive outside cells is extremely weak. The reason why it cannot be detected in the patient's blood may also be unrelated to this.</p>
<p>(6) Transmission Methods and Immunology Aspects</p>
<p>The transmission of various Li Kejia diseases is not directly from person to person. Instead, a middleman acts as the vector for this task. Each Li Kejia disease has its own specialized vector, listed as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The vector (transmitter) of epidemic typhus is the body louse Pediculus Vestimenti.</p>
<p>(2) The vector of scrub typhus is the scrub mite (red mite) Trombicula Akamushi.</p>
<p>(3) The vector of Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the wood tick Permacemtor Venustus.</p>
<p>(4) The vector of trench fever is lice of an undetermined type Lausenart.</p>
<p>In addition to the vector, there is also a long-term reservoir of the pathogen, the so-called "Vlrustregr" in this play. Non-human hosts and past patients are animals, such as wild mice, Microsus Montebelli in scrub typhus. The method of transmission is that infected lice carrying Li Kejia in their active and proliferative stages pierce the skin when sucking human blood. Because Li Kejia constantly reproduces in the digestive tract, the epithelial cells of the intestine or stomach in lice undergo unlimited reproduction, and when the cell volume is excessive and cannot hold more, it will rupture. These Li Kejia then flow into the wound along with the leakage of digestive fluids. At this location, an initial rash occurs, gradually leading to local necrosis, sometimes becoming an ulcer, and then spreading to the body and other parts. The route taken at this time, according to the facts of pathological dissection, is of course still along the outer walls of blood vessels. In addition to the pathological tissue conditions, the main point of the cause of the disease is undoubtedly the production of toxins. After one encounter with Li Kejia, so-called immunity can be obtained. In other words, a second occurrence is unlikely. However, this immunity is not absolute. There is sometimes the possibility of a second infection, but it will be easier to recover from. Although the existence of antitoxins has not yet been directly proven, skin allergic reactions were demonstrated in past epidemic typhus patients by Wantman and Brockdy Goodmann &amp; Kroide in a report from the Department of Medical Microbiology at New York University. Regarding the skin allergic reaction of scrub typhus, the author also successfully obtained it on immune animals while staying at the Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo last year (1935), and repeated trials yielded the same results. Currently, it is being tested on past scrub typhus patients. Regardless of the outcome, judging from the author's clinical and pathological facts, the existence of immunity (antitoxins) is beyond doubt. Antikorper Immunitat</p>
<p>(7) Clinical Symptoms</p>
<p>(Various Li Kejia diseases vary slightly; here, epidemic typhus is used as an example for explanation.)</p>
<p>The incubation period of epidemic typhus is usually four to fourteen days, rarely exceeding two weeks. At the beginning, a high fever appears, usually reaching 39 to 40 degrees Celsius or higher, slightly lower in the morning, but is a strong fever lasting two weeks to the fourteenth or fifteenth day, then drops suddenly. The period of rash production is usually the fourth to sixth day after the onset of the disease. Initially, it is irregular fine spots the size of pinheads, with the surface raised above the skin, giving a pricking sensation when touched. When pressed, the redness disappears, but after two or three days, the rash becomes more apparent, the redness deepens, and the center appears dark red, forming hemorrhagic spots. After two weeks, it begins to disappear on its own, replaced by colored spots, which gradually fade on their own as the disease heals. The initial sites of appearance are the abdomen, chest, and shoulders, gradually spreading to the whole body, with the face and neck being exceptions. Common symptoms are severe headache, back pain, nausea, and extreme fatigue. Conjunctivitis is also an early symptom, so patients are very sensitive to light. The facial skin is completely flushed, the mind is unclear, and sleep is disturbed, often suffering from insomnia.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge Question and Answer on Diseases</h3>
<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(94) Chronic Gastric Mucositis</p>
<p>(Question) How does chronic gastric mucositis arise?</p>
<p>(Answer) The cause of this disease is either a continuation of acute gastric mucositis or, like acute gastric mucositis, it is caused by dietary carelessness. It can also be caused by excessive drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>(Question) When the body suffers from which diseases, will this disease be complicated?</p>
<p>(Answer) When suffering from liver cirrhosis, kidney disease, syphilis, tuberculosis, anemia, heart disease, respiratory disease, stomach cancer, gastric dilatation, etc., chronic gastric mucositis is mostly complicated.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of chronic gastric mucositis?</p>
<p>(Answer) They are roughly the same as acute ones. However, the symptoms are not as acute. Patients have symptoms such as lack of appetite, fullness in the stomach, pressure in the stomach, belching, heartburn, and a thick coating on the tongue.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the objective symptoms?</p>
<p>(Answer) Pressing on the patient's stomach with the hand reveals fullness, tenderness to the touch, and a splashing sound.</p>
<p>(Question) How does a patient with this disease feel uncomfortable?</p>
<p>(Answer) Patients feel heaviness in the head, headache, insomnia, reduced work ability, mental disturbance, gastric vertigo, etc. And the overall nutritional status is naturally impaired.</p>
<p>(Question) Is there any abnormality in gastric secretion?</p>
<p>(Answer) There is a lack of free hydrochloric acid in the gastric juice, while mucus secretion increases.</p>
<p>(Question) How is chronic gastric mucositis diagnosed?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is not difficult to diagnose based on the above symptoms; however, it should be distinguished from stomach cancer, gastric neurosis, and lack of gastric juice.</p>
<p>(Question) What point should be emphasized in the treatment of this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the treatment of chronic gastric mucositis, the first thing to do is to find out the cause and remove it. This is the most important point.</p>
<p>(Question) What attention should be paid to the patient's food?</p>
<p>(Answer) The patient's food must avoid oily and greasy foods, limit vegetable and fruit foods, eat more rice, flour, and sugar, and avoid drinking alcohol, spices, and excess water.</p>
<p>(Question) What medicines are used for the treatment of chronic gastric mucositis?</p>
<p>(Answer) The medicines for treating this disease are nothing more than acidic agents, bitter agents, alkaline agents, and digestive enzyme preparations.</p>
<p>(Question) How are acidic agents used?</p>
<p>(Answer) Acidic agents, commonly use dilute hydrochloric acid, and digestive enzyme pepsin is used at the same time. Aodiol Pepsin is a preparation that has already been combined.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the types of bitter agents?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are many kinds of bitter agents, such as Cendurango preparations, gentian, bitter tincture, quinine tincture, Colombo root decoction, etc. Their effects are all to promote gastric movement and secretion.</p>
<p>(Question) Which alkaline agents are used?</p>
<p>(Answer) The most common alkaline agents are sodium bicarbonate, calcined magnesia, mineral spring water, Cal-Bis Mo, magnesium peroxide, etc.</p>

<p>Comment</p>
<h3>Confusing and Unpredictable European Political Situation</h3>
<p>— Wo</p>
<p>The King of Belgium's announcement of neutrality the other day has greatly changed the European situation. The New York Min Sheng Jiang Tan Bao (New York People's Voice Forum Newspaper) said that the European collective security system had already died young, and this time the King of Belgium's announcement of neutrality is like giving it the final blow. Indeed, the King of Belgium did not consult with Britain and France beforehand, and the sudden announcement of this speech made Britain and France suspicious and uneasy. France and Belgium originally had a close relationship, and cooperation between France and Belgium was still difficult to contain Germany, which was full of ambition. Therefore, the Franco-Belgian alliance has long been an important factor in France's defense preparations. Now, because of Belgium's actions, the Maginot Line must be extended from the Belgian border to the coast. This has added another layer of defensive work to France, and the European situation has inevitably been shaken.</p>
<p>Moreover, this decision by the King to announce neutrality, from the surface, is that France has one less helper. If the King of Belgium changes his national policy and is nominally neutral but actually favors Germany, then France will not only have one less helper but also one more enemy, and the European situation would be even more unthinkable. Therefore, Britain and France are particularly suspicious, while Germany and Italy express joy. Britain and France cannot but question the true meaning of the King of Belgium's announcement of neutrality. No wonder Britain and France are deeply concerned about this move. According to European news, the King of Belgium has no intention of leaning towards Germany. His intention is nothing more than to escape the vortex of war and avoid being ravaged by airplanes and artillery. Then the suspicion that the King of Belgium favors Germany seems to be alleviated somewhat.</p>
<p>Belgium is to Europe like the state of Zheng was to the Spring and Autumn period, situated between two great powers, and is often subjected to the misfortunes of war. The war in Europe was a painful lesson, and it is still chilling to think about. Now, Germany is rearming and has a great determination to avenge its humiliation, and the Italian and German fascists are also reconnecting with each other. Germany and Austria also express friendship. The situation before the Great War has returned. If war breaks out again, not only Belgium would be unthinkable, but all of Europe would suffer catastrophe. However, the attitude of Britain and France is extremely soft. If Germany still follows General Schlieffen's plan before the war in Europe (i.e., passing through Belgium) to attack France, then Belgium will inevitably bear the brunt and suffer first.</p>
<p>Even if Germany has no intention of attacking France, and the recent Franco-Russian pact is successful, if war breaks out between Russia and Germany, then Belgium will inevitably become a battlefield for the two countries. Therefore, the reason why the King of Belgium announced strict neutrality this time is because of this. In fact, due to Belgium's geographical location, if war does not break out in Europe, that's one thing, but if war does break out, Belgium's desire to strictly adhere to neutrality is not only impossible but also beyond its ability. A country that can defend itself and is not afraid of invasion must also have great power to help others fight, the so-called "having a decisive influence." Therefore, there are still doubts about Belgium's power.</p>
<p>Therefore, this time the King of Belgium's announcement of neutrality greatly alarmed Britain and France and pleased Germany and Italy. But in the world, there are no coincidences. The compromise between Germany and Austria has already been successful, and the situation of the three countries (Germany, Austria, and Italy) being united seems to be settled. Unexpectedly, yesterday's newspaper reported that Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg also issued a declaration, saying that he would maintain national independence, and that no other country should interfere in internal affairs. The political system will be decided by the people. He expressed disappointment with the Austro-German agreement. This declaration is like throwing a bomb at the German fascists. Therefore, the declarations of neutrality by Belgium and Austria can be said to offset and cancel each other out. This matter should also be welcomed by Britain and France and alarmed by Germany and Italy.</p>
<h3>Blacksmith Lao Liu</h3>
<p>— Lin Ji</p>
<p>How quickly did the life of Blacksmith Lao Liu, filled with humiliation, pass—just like an arrow leaving the string, shot out in an instant, he was already over fifty years old.</p>
<p>Thin as a monkey, his back had hunched over since who knows when, always with those sharp eyes open, Lao Liu's appearance was very pitiful. So old, yet he had to forge iron all day long, using those dry firewood-like arms to raise the iron hammer and strike it again and again on the red-hot iron piece. The fire in the furnace burned fiercely, right next to Lao Liu, so soon Lao Liu would sweat, dripping on the black, stagnant floor like small raindrops. In the narrow and dark blacksmith shop, the air was terribly turbid; Lao Liu, who had been breathing in such air for more than twenty years, now suffered from severe tuberculosis, coughing constantly. Spitting had become a very bad habit of his; he always spat here and there, piles of it, hygiene was not something Lao Liu like people could take into consideration, to spit a mouthful, what was it to him! Helping Lao Liu work every day were two apprentices; the smaller one squatted in a corner pulling the bellows, his face covered in black ash, a child who had just run away from the countryside not long ago. The other one used tongs to clamp out the red-hot iron block and forged it with Lao Liu—the shop resounded with the sound of "ding da… ding da" all day long.</p>
<p>Now, Lao Liu was all alone, without a wife, children, or relatives, truly a desolate old age. When someone asked about him, he would always lower his head, as if he had some sad thing, and silently walk away with tears in his eyes. He didn't seem to feel excited about life; but he was always a little unwilling to die—to be able to live one day with this heaven-given life, Lao Liu was satisfied enough.</p>
<p>I had known Lao Liu and his blacksmith shop since I was a child: later I left my hometown, year after year, my memory had faded so much that I couldn't even remember Lao Liu's face. This time I returned to my hometown, a hometown where everything had changed, and in the midst of overwhelming emotion, I happened to pass by Lao Liu's place one day and greeted him, and unexpectedly he kept me there.</p>
<p>It was an evening when summer was about to pass, the weather was still very hot, and Lao Liu was cooling off at the door. He told the little apprentice to carry out a bamboo chair, specially wiped off the dust on it with a cloth, and courteously invited me to sit down. I had never seen Blacksmith Lao Liu greet me so happily, I was a little strange but after a while I understood, Lao Liu's life for so many years had been too lonely, too dull, without even one person to talk to. Really, that evening he asked me many questions, about the outside world, and I answered him in detail. Lao Liu had once drifted to cities outside when he was young, but the situation now had become too difficult. In this ancient and peaceful countryside, he had stayed for more than twenty years, watching the younger generation grow up, his feelings were so deep.</p>
<p>"If it hadn't been for the war in the countryside that year, I would still have a home," Lao Liu suddenly brought up his past. "I remember very clearly, that year my son was already four years old, he had just learned to speak, he was smart and strong... but the artillery fire started; the Chinese were fighting fiercely for territory among themselves, so fiercely that there was no time to escape, the army窜 (cuan, meaning to flee in disorder) through this village, raped my wife, and that strong child died from excessive fear! ... So many years have passed since this happened, and I haven't forgotten it at all!" Speaking of this, tears flowed from the corners of his sharp eyes, and he also looked up and sighed deeply.</p>
<p>I had never known about Blacksmith Lao Liu's tragedy before. Since then, he no longer had a close person, and silently carried the burden of life, limping along on the journey of life. Now, Lao Liu was aging.</p>
<p>I didn't know how to comfort him, thinking about how the civil war had destroyed his happiness, and the whip of life had hunched his back, and I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>When autumn came, I left the ancient hometown again and drifted outside. Every time I thought of my hometown, I remembered the conversation I had with Blacksmith Lao Liu that night. I thought he must still be silently holding the iron hammer, hitting the red-hot iron block, passing the days of his old age.</p>

<h3>Autumn Night</h3>
<p>— Yan Ting</p>
<p>Walking along the river ferry, I arrived at the beach.</p>
<p>The moonlight was hazy, the tide had already receded, and the beach had become wide and quiet. The noise of this city disappeared on the other side of the gray-white city wall. There was no human sound here, and I couldn't hear the galloping of cars and horses, and the shouting. There was only gloom and emptiness.</p>
<p>I strolled on the sand, my eyes looking at the distant village, where the weak howls of dogs often came from, listening quietly to the groaning of the seabed; but these could not fill the dryness and emptiness in my heart. Three days ago, I came to this small city with a stomach full of hope, and three days later, I sold all my things and was starving. So wandering on this beach every night has become a daily life course for me.</p>
<p>Gently I strolled from this side to that side, and then wanted to stroll from that side to this side, but a short and strange sound attracted me. I hesitated and stood still, locking in the surroundings. I couldn't see anything, there was only the sound of the night wind hitting the banyan tree branches on the shore, and the groaning of the seabed. So I lifted my feet again and wanted to continue the endless wandering, but I didn't continue for some time. In that deathly silence, I heard a sob, coming from a ruined temple on the shore. I began to walk over there.</p>
<p>This was a dilapidated temple, the palace pavilion had collapsed, the stone courtyard was covered with broken tiles and remnants of gray soil, piled up into a small hill, with centipede grass growing on it. The temple was very dark, filled with a musty and damp smell. I stepped onto the stone steps of the palace pavilion and suddenly stopped. The sobs became clearer, coming from people's throats, and from a woman's throat.</p>
<p>I began to pay attention to every corner of this temple. In the place where good men and women worshiped, I found a clump, small, grayish-white animal wriggling, moving as if a wounded beast was shivering. So I coughed softly and stepped inside.</p>
<p>Now, I stood in front of this wriggling animal, able to see clearly its outline and every small twitch. Her head, with long hair, was being embraced by two small, naked arms, her whole body also naked and curled up. She seemed to have heard the sound of my footsteps coming in, and slowly raised her head from her arms, looking at me in surprise with big round eyes. From her small face, I determined that she was a little girl who had not yet reached maturity.</p>
<p>She looked at me fearfully, suddenly raised her head, and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>"Get out! You shameless rogue!" She lowered her head and sobbed again.</p>
<p>This made me so surprised that I hurriedly moved back a few steps. But she did not scare me. I mustered up the courage and ran up.</p>
<p>"You have already ravaged me and robbed me of everything, are you still not satisfied?" She cried for a while, as if she felt something was wrong, and raised her head again, shouting in an angry and sad tone.</p>
<p>"I don't understand what you mean." I also whispered in reply.</p>
<p>She was obviously a little surprised, because in the darkness I saw her eyes widened beyond normal.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" she asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"Me?" I replied coldly "An unemployed man and a wanderer...</p>
<p>"Then what are you doing here, not with them? ..."</p>
<p>"What are you saying, I don't understand a word." I shook my head.</p>
<p>"Maybe you're not with them." She muttered to herself "Just now two big men were here and ×× me, and before leaving they stripped the clothes off my body...</p>
<p>"Who are you? You said people ×× you. ..."</p>
<p>"Me?" she said coldly with a laugh, "A prostitute..." Then lowed her voice to add: "In the evening I sing songs for a few customers in a teahouse, and two big men asked me to go to a hotel with them, so I went with them, but they didn't go to a hotel, they cheated me to come here. ..."</p>
<p>"Where are they now!"</p>
<p>"They didn't give me any money, and instead snatched my clothes and ran away." Her tone became choked with sobs. "Now I have nothing, my whole body is naked, how can I go back... "She cried sadly.</p>
<p>I stood there blankly, a feeling of悲怆 (beichuang, sorrow) pierced me, so I took off the only set of clothes I had on my back that I used to change into and handed it to her:</p>
<p>"Take it, this is my last set of clothes.</p>
<p>After saying that, I walked out silently, facing the misty</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shen Shen</p>
<p>Everyone has the same conviction that our path is correct and the future is bright.</p>
<p>No one speaks, no one dares to think. Only silently walking with heads lowered, our footsteps are uniform. Thud, thud—thud, thud—thud…</p>
<p>What a terrifying silence—cherishing a sliver of hope: that everyone will sing a song.</p>
<p>But everyone didn’t sing. Yet—</p>
<p>Caw——a flock of crows took flight. Feeling a bit stifled, I cursed something even I couldn’t hear, as if my lips only twitched.</p>
<p>A bolt from the blue on a clear day, old Qu’s mouth twitched:</p>
<p>“Only sixty li from Fenghuang Prefectural City—li, eh…”</p>
<p>Ah——Heaven—is this our guide, old Qu?</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned. Sixty li! It seemed our ears hadn’t deceived us.</p>
<p>The footsteps went thud—thud—thud… slowing down. And then—</p>
<p>No one issued a command, but everyone stopped and sat down.</p>
<p>Heaven, I don’t know what time it was, but it was getting dark. A few stars reflected in squinting eyes, looking just like those of devils, damn it!</p>
<p>The round moon was embedded in the gray-green sky, hanging above our heads. Frost-like moonlight sprinkled on the land with tall sorghum, on the hills covered with trees, and also on the faces of this group of desperate men. It was so fair, so gentle.</p>
<p>Lovely moon!</p>
<p>Three. Silence. Yet silence accomplishes nothing. We must continue, we must endure, according to our agreement.</p>
<p>Our agreement: We agreed to disband sixty li from the prefectural city. We have reached a dead end, receiving no supplies, and surrounded by large numbers of devil soldiers. Our own strength is small, and our bullets are pitifully few. Now there is nothing we can do but leave behind eleven hardened men. We have other important missions to carry out! Now—</p>
<p>After giving the five brothers and the brothers from other units one last farewell, then we eleven…</p>
<p>Go! We leave. Tears are flowing, hoarse throats are shouting.</p>
<p>“Farewell, brothers! Take care. Someday, we will meet again!”</p>
<p>Tears blurred my eyes. Old Li, the tall one!… each one flashed before me, nodding.</p>
<p>My heart aches. Finally, I left them, and they left me. Alone, I set foot on the frosty, moonlit road.</p>
<p>Wave after wave of the unique, cool fragrance of the sorghum fields of Guanwai hits me!</p>

The virtuous Sima of Jiangzhou sits in the high seat, the wine is flowing freely at the banquet, at that moment, the honored guests and gracious host sat closely together, not even singing songs and reciting poems for pleasure, but just then, there was a woman of exceptional charm on the neighboring boat, who was able to play a tune on the interrupted pipa, who knew that the old autumn girl was still gorgeous, and that her voice was melodious and extraordinary. It is said that "Faded Flowers" is the name, and she sees the guests with infinite shame, lowered her head silently, and then asked about the beginning, saying that she had relied on the door to be charming when she was young, inseparable from dancing fans and singing, and then, the door became deserted with no carriages and horses, and the head had no home and could not return, so she married a merchant, and her husband went to Fuliang and had not returned, so she was a solitary goose with no partner, so she had to use her old skills to make a living, and it was only because the livelihood was sparse and the family was difficult, not because the beauty was still unfortunate, but because she pitied her own situation and insulted her hairpin, unexpectedly, she brought out the tears of the Sima of Jiangzhou, and her tears stained her green shirt, originally, she was an affectionate person of great talent, and her heart was broken and her soul was lost, not hesitating to give heavy rewards, and the yamen runners went back already late.

<h3>"Secret Code" March</h3>
<p>"Secret Code" has completed one-third of the entire project. The complex scenes have mostly been filmed in advance, and the rest are expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The female lead, Lin Shaoqin, has been living a secluded life lately. Every day, she must hold the original "Secret Code" in her dormitory and study its content and spirit. However, every morning, she appears at Xuanwu Lake, either singing aloud or rowing a small boat to cultivate her body and mind. It is said that she dares not slack off in her work on "Secret Code."</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei has no plays to film for the time being, so he has asked for leave to return to Shanghai to visit his family, from whom he has been separated for a short time. He may bring his wife to Jinzhong for a short stay on Sunday.</p>
<p>Gao Zhanfei told old friends in the Shanghai film industry that since entering the film industry, he has found "Secret Code" to be the most satisfying work to perform, except for the film "Soul of Freedom."</p>
<p>Shang Guanwu's Hu Fu posture in "The Road" will reappear in "Secret Code." Shang said: Hu Fu is easy to play, but Governor Zhou is really not easy to be, which shows how important his role is in the film.</p>
<p>Zhu Juliet, who plays Governor Zhou's concubine in the play, is a newcomer, but her performance is so charming and romantic that it is hard to believe that she is a newcomer to the silver screen. Movie fans should pay attention to her.</p>
