<h3 id="c11">我國將得國聯半常任理事問題 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>上月二十七日國聯行政院的理事員額分配問題委員會在日內瓦開會經二日之久通過英國代表薛西爾勳爵的建議向行政院提出報吿書將行政院非常任理事席數由九席增至十一席其中新增的一席畀予亞洲大陸國家的中國任期以三年爲期這建議當可爲本月十一日開會的行政院例會所接受到了九月國聯大會時中國大槪又可重入行政院而佔一個理事席位了</p>
<p>行政院理事員額分配委員會爲什麽會建議增加理事席數而畀與中國一席呢要說明這個問題我們就不能不提及我國競選國聯理事的歷史我國自加入國聯以後當選行政院理事共計有三次而要求連任或再選失敗的也有三决最後一次要求連任失敗的是在一九三四年依照國聯所通過的辦法非常任理事國在任期屆滿後三年內耍求連任者須先取得會員國三分二多數贊成之連任權然後方有加入競選的資格而三分二之多數贊成票在事實上是頗不易得到的前年我國之耍求連任權就以二十一票的少票而被吾决連任權旣未獲得就根本沒有參加競選的資格我國政府因鑒於前年競選失敗的敎訓卽改變方法於去年國聯大會中提出半常任理事席的耍求仍未被國聯接受而僅由行政院通過組織一個十四國委員會討論中國的要求以及理事員額的分配問題此委員會曾於去年開會向各會員國政府徵求意見最近復召開會議通過報吿書向行政院建議將非常任理事增加二席並以一席畀予我國這就是這决十四國委員會决議的由來至行政院與國聯大會能吾接受此小組委員會之報吿書現在雖還不能預料不過依照近日來的形勢觀察九月後我國之重佔一席非常任理事的席位大槪是有八九分把握的</p>
<p>中國的行將當選理事對於我們自己以及世界和平有沒有什麽影響呢這是要看我們自己以後的努力而决定的我們都知道國聯在初成立的時候本是個强大帝國主義者的集團不過近年以來因爲侵略主義者的先後退出國聯以及蘇聯與土爾其的加入國聯已比較地成爲一個緩和戰爭爆發的機關而爲集體安全制度中的重耍因素了此後中國之將當選理事自然也是和平勢力增加的一種表徵因爲中國就是一個極端愛好和平的國家不過國聯的威望與力量近年因迭受侵略主義者的摧殘已喪失殆盡而中國本身又爲侵略主義國家的犧牲品非但於國聯不能有多大的貢獻而反有求國聯帮助之處此後我們如要希望國聯能够成爲一個維持和平的有力機關而爲集體安全制度的重要支柱並不愧爲一個理事國起見那末我們就首須充實自己的力量能够抵抗侵略爲和平的前途而犧牲這樣不但可以把我們自己從水深火熱之中拯救出來而且也就是間接增厚國聯的力量鞏固集體安全制度的勢力耍是不然的則中國的當選理事在實際上是沒有多大的意義的</p>

<p>（倫敦）英國駐阿公使巴頓氏今日以無綫電報告外部、謂阿皇已離京、現城中愴聲四起、搶劫橫行、陷入無政府狀態、多數外人、現皆逃入使館區域、同時今晨阿京之無錢電台亦暫告不不通、巴頓並謂、阿京使館區域、現處於危險狀態、故巴頓盼望意軍能於明日入城、藉維治安、蓋現在担任維持使館區域者僅有印度步兵二百五十人及機關槍五架、雖有鐵絲網等障碍物及足敷三月之糧食、防禦力殊威不足也、據說此間各國公使一待意軍到後、皆將回國、據今日消息、意軍現已進抵離阿京三十五哩之愛傑薩、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）阿皇之由阿京出奔、使國聯遭遇空前之問題、國聯中人今皆非常窘困、如須維持國聯盟約、則國聯應繼續進行對意之制裁、但意國今顯將振振有詞、指阿皇爲竊位者、豫料倫敦與巴黎間將在五月十一日國聯行政院開會以前、作外交恊商、以期覔得一種諒解、大約尚將與意國協商也（二日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿皇今日於率領禁衛隊五千人開赴山地之前、接見新聞記者、聲稱、至不得己時、我人將放棄首都、此事關係並不重大、因我人當在南方另建新都也、又謂余决不願與意人直接談判、我國對於和平之談話、將以國聯爲唯一途徑、余决不願拋棄國家、但世界各國是吾將拋棄我國而任其受惡劣命運之宰制乎、又謂阿國决不乞求和平、余决將重組余之武力、以與意人周旋、我人與意人之戰爭、非獨並未告終、且將從此權續不輟也、又據目擊阿皇之新聞記者言、阿皇神態現頗蒼老、鬚髮已呈斑白狀、雙手皆有白布紮綁、據說此爲受意軍毒氣灼傷所致之結果、（一日國民電）</p>

<p>中央社云、自皖贛兩省政府决定統一運銷紅茶、組織皖贛紅茶運銷委員會以來、上海洋莊茶棧、起而呼籲、函電紛馳、舉世因以矚目、日前孔部長談話、認爲兩省統一紅茶運銷、目的乃在平衡產銷、提高品質、商人以爲政府與民爭利、係屬誤會、而茶棧方面、並未因孔部長之談話、摒息爭執、近聞由全國工業聯合會錢承緒、代表彼等赴皖接洽、以維護茶棧利益、究竟眞相如何、外界莫衷一是、記者爲欲明瞭此决兩省政府統一紅茶運銷事件之底蘊、特往皖贛紅茶運銷委員會總運銷處副經理曾雨辰、曾氏爲江西省政府代表、對於兩省政府之措施、躬與其事、承其以兩省政府辦理紅茶統一運銷之經過、見告如下、</p>
<p>接洽經過運銷計劃　　曾氏對於兩省政府辦理統一運銷紅茶之動機及經過、首謂、紅茶貿易、日漸衰落、已為無可諱言之事實、其應急起挽救、爲政府當然之責任、本年二月間、適全國經濟委員會召集茶業技術討論會、安徽建設廳提議統一祁紅運銷、以利國際貿易一案、卽經會議通過、安徽省政府本會議通過之原則、派員赴贛接洽、擴大統一運銷之範圍、由全國經濟委員會農業處趙處長·江西省政府委員蕭純錦·及安徽省政府代表何崇傑等、積極規劃、决定皖贛紅茶運銷委員會之組織、及其事業計劃綱要、先後由江西安微兩省政府委員會議通過、皖贛紅茶運銷委員會、乃於四月一日、在安慶正式成立、推定全國經濟委員會趙處畏連芳·及皖贛兩省財建廳長爲常務委員、並議决各種要案、　關於運銷者、由兩省公路局充分準備車輛、在祁門浮梁產區汽車站接受商號茶葉、分別運至宣城鷹潭、交江南鐵路及浙贛鐵路轉運赴滬、旣可擔保安全、並能節省時間、其運費較從前由鄱陽湖運九江裝輪、且稍减少、至德茶箱、亦改由安慶裝輪、極爲便利、　關於推銷者、在上海設總運銷處、延聘中外茶師、組織茶葉品質評定委員會、平衡市價、茶價無由抑勒、洋商亦不至欺矇、並擬在倫教設分銷處、謀直接輸出與俄國接洽、恢復固有市場、　關於貸欵為三項、第一項、由安徽建設廳與交通銀行合籌四十萬兀、安徽二成、交通八成、貸給祁門各茶葉合作社、第二項、由皖贛兩省府與安徽地方銀行合籌一百四十萬元、地方銀行八成、計一百一十二萬元、餘二成皖認二十萬、贛認八萬元、全部貸給祁門至德浮梁三縣茶號、月息八釐、不計複利、年底還淸、如屆時茶葉未售罄、得展限二個月、第三項、由汀西裕民銀行獨家貸欵三十萬兀、給修武銅鼓武陵三縣、其利率與安徽同、亦爲八釐、</p>
<p>登記茶號已百餘家</p>
<p>曾氏繼談、祁門·至德·浮梁·三縣茶號記登、已辦理竣事、計祁門登記茶號、一二五家、浮梁七六號、至德四十餘家、總計貸出欵額一百五十餘萬元、超過預定數額十餘萬元、三縣茶箱、總數的計五萬餘箱、想能適合市塲之需要、</p>
<p>救濟步驟共分四點</p>
<p>關於政府統一紅茶運銷之目的、曾氏鄭重申明、决非籍統一運銷之名、以謀財政上之收入、更非與民爭利、政府為保障銀行投資、且搭放二成、將來銀行萬一有損失時、即以政府之二成先行貼補、故政府辦理統一運銷、反有鉅額經費之支出、政府對於救濟紅茶、擬分四點做去、即（一）產、（二）製、（三）運、（四）銷、關於產與製兩方面係時間問題、新的種製方法、正由茶葉改良塲、在試騐推行中、關於運與銷、係經濟問題及組織問題、以政府之力量出而改良運銷、與茶葉貿易之前途、大有利益、中國紅茶、在世界銷塲衰落、重要原因、由於成本昂貴、運銷改良、即係針對成本昂貴之設施、統一運銷以後、絕對可减低成本、（一）茶號以前承貸茶棧欵額、利率一分五厘、現在具領政府貸欵、利率八厘、計减少利率幾及一半、（二）茶號茶箱以前經都陽湖轉九江至上海、經過頗多風險、去年茶箱、在鄱陽湖沉沒二千餘箱、損失之鉅、實非商人所能担負、且經鄱陽湖轉九江至上海運費頗昂、現在政府統一運銷、由公路鐵路聯運、旣平妥又敏捷、運費亦特別便宜、（三）茶號以前銷售茶葉、悉數委托茶棧、佣金及其他使費、幾佔茶葉售價百分之十五、現在政府統一運銷、只收百分之二手續費、其他一槪不取、政府認為經此三點、改良以後、成本必可減低、成本低、外匯又有利輸出、紅茶貿易之前途、自較樂觀、政府再稍假時日、從產與製兩點積極着手、紅茶危機之挽回、頗有希望、</p>
<p>茶棧反對殊為惋惜</p>
<p>至本埠各茶棧、反對政府辦法、曾氏殊爲各茶棧惋惜、曾氏以爲茶棧無論如何、不應以少數私人利益、阻撓整個紅茶事業、關於茶棧本身之地位存在與否、為時代問題、時代愈前進、貿易愈趨直接、貨物由生產者直接售與消費者、與生產及消費者均有利益、中間人之轉手、非必不得已、决不能任其增多、中間人愈增加、成本愈增加、减少中間人轉手、爲經濟學上不可磨滅之理論、各茶棧不明斯理、對於政府辦法、一味反對、不顧紅茶在國際貿易之地位、似有違反時代之精神、電車發明以後、人力車夫大起恐慌、忽而搗毀電車、實際上電車之行駛、决不因人力車夫之搗毀而中止、而人力車夫工作、另有別種需要、亦能同時生存、並未因電車行駛而絕跡、茶棧反對政府辦法、無異於人力車夫之反對電車、而忽略統一運銷辦法、爲時代之產物、本身地位、與人力車夫一樣、未必即因統一運銷以後、而完全消滅、况政府對於茶棧之債務問題、及茶棧失業問題、亦曾充分顧慮、顧及茶棧地位辦法、計分三點、　儘量羅致茶棧人才、助理會務、　茶商舊欠茶棧欵項、於售茶後、召集雙方、依照習慣處理、如有糾紛、由雙方自行依法解决、　本年茶號、曾領棧欵者、茶棧如不願再行貸放、可由委員會審査後、移轉其貸欵及利息、爲茶棧計、應當擁護政府辦法、以其經騐及人力、供獻政府、通力合作、共謀紅茶貿易之發展、個人深信、茶棧諸君、改變反對政府之態度、而與政府合作、茶棧本身之利益、政府亦决不吝於維護、倘茶棧仍事爭執、則政府爲公令所關、亦已盡其曲予優容之所能矣、</p>
<p>詳細辦法逐步實施</p>
<p>曾氏末稱、統一運銷、爲救濟紅茶之初步目的、政府將更進而規劃詳細辦法、逐步實施、以為兩省農民謀直接之利益、尙望各界人士、起而協助、兩省農民生活之改進、都利賴於斯、</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>「肺活」Philh　Weal係根據德國柏爾託爾特A.A.Berthold及英國史泰林Starling二大生物學泰斗倡導臟器療法之原理而創造。其成分爲壯健動物新鮮肺臟及脾臟中抽出之內分泌—荷爾蒙·混合製劑曾經施行動物之嚴密試騐。並由世界各國肺病療養院用於人體結核之治療。作長期臨床實騐。確認有非常之效果。超乎一切化學藥劑。千古迄今。醫家束手與病家所謂絕症之肺結核（肺癆）。自「肺活」Phith　Weal之臟器療法發現以來。已成爲現今醫　之名角。有風靡及革新治療界之氣概。此獨一無二之最新創造。已得全世界公認。視爲肺癆患者之一新生命。可不爲過言也。今將『肺活』對於肺病治療之特點略述於左。</p>
<p>能調和新陳代謝。促進內分泌之機能。使已衰退之組織復活。以達到生理的防禦機能旺盛—尅服癆菌。</p>
<p>可依組織再生之機能。而填補病竈之缺損。並促進結締組織之增殖。使病竈形成疤痕。而促進治愈之機轉。縮短經過期間。</p>
<p>於病竈之周圍。築成鞏固結締之牆壁。使之硬化。旣造成此完全之堤防。結核菌（癆菌）遂被封鎖。失其活動。終必完全消滅。</p>
<p>刺激脾臟之機能。以促進造血之作用旺盛。而使體重增加。營養佳良。</p>
<p>對於病竈之浸潤。能吸收之或溶化之且能抑制癆菌毒素之分泌中和體內毒素。發生解毒作用。故服至數日後潮熱盜汗即可消失。</p>
<p>能增加胃熱。及促進分泌之作用。使消化力旺盛。食慾增進。</p>
<p>有强大凝血力。不論血痰咯血。防止效力均甚顯著。</p>
<p>有產生特異之免疫體。能增加體內抗毒作用。並使結核之感受性體質。改造爲不感受性（即謂免疫性者）有癆治癆—無癆防癆。</p>
<p>現今歐美諸邦各大肺病療養院皆採用此種臟器新療法。據臨床醫家之報告肺癆息者（）論一二三期）內服臟器製劑之「肺活」Phith　Weal的七八日。即見熱度下降。咳嗽减少自覺心身愉快。諸症輕减病勢好轉。如繼續服至一月以上。則體量加重。一切症狀消失。在X光下檢視即可見病部結成結疤。已入痊愈狀態。</p>

<p>— SCOTT　HALL作　徐生章醫師</p>
<p>所謂神經褻弱一語，想諸君是常聽說的，牠在靑年間極爲流行，這病是使有爲的靑年，在學問之中途，受挫折的一大原因，幷且，不僅靑年，即是老年和壯年的人，也常患神經衰弱，所以，本症爲現代文明社會中最普遍發生的一種疾病，在精神苦悶，身心過勞，或是用功過度，性交與手淫之無限制者，多發現本病。今將此疾之症狀以及其一般療法，述之如下</p>
<p>神經衰弱症，病狀有種種不同，細別之可以分爲先天性與後天性兩大種類。</p>
<p>後天性神經衰弱</p>
<p>一般之所謂神經衰弱症，率多指後天性神經衰弱症而言。本症主要症候：睡眠障碍，注意散亂，記憶力減退，頭重，反射亢進等，此外尚有頭痛，倦怠，易怒，眩暈，耳嗚，等症狀。</p>
<p>先天性神經衰弱</p>
<p>先天性神經衰弱，亦稱之爲體質衰弱或單稱神經質。生來就有精神症候—允其是感情和意志症狀最著。（關於感情方面）過敏，富刺激性，易激怒，脾氣粗暴，不快，無能感，卑下劣等感，注意些微瑣事，啾咕，有强迫觀念，恐懼症…………</p>
<p>關於注意力方面，缺乏抵抗，週事不能忍耐，無思考力，决斷遲鈍。重症時，性質變異，完全以自己爲本位，自恣，厚於待己，簿於待人，對人苛酷，愛情之念强，見異思遷乏特續性，允其有飲酒，放蕩等惡癖……雖呈上述症狀，但毫無自覺的觀念。</p>
<p>有時呈外向——攻擊的性格，能成爲爭鬥家，煽動家，易起暴行。若有內向的性格時，則呈沈鬱，厭世，悲觀，尋死，嫌人等怪症狀</p>
<p>以上就是神經衰弱症的概况，其症狀之多，危害之大，由此也就可以推想到了。</p>
<p>神經衰弱的攝養</p>
<p>第一須先戒除精神與身體之過勞，多欣賞山水等大自然景緻，以開拓心胸，休養，睡眠耍充足，郊外散步，吸新鮮空氣，親近日光，使身心保持安靜。嚴禁煙酒，對於茶，咖啡等，須要節制。關於食物，避免鹹，辣，芥末等刺　性食品。其他肉食以及富刺　亢奮性食物，亦須特別注意。</p>
<p>日常生活，亦須有規則，有紀律，起床吃飯，沐浴，散步，運動，休息等，均須規定適宜之時間。嚴禁晚睡，或出入游戲塲，跳舞塲，淫猥談話書報等，亦須避免入目。對於性慾之亢奮以及手淫行爲之惡習，必須節制或戒絕之。</p>
<p>神經衰弱根治法</p>
<p>關於本症的根治方法，吾人必須以補劑滋養神經，使其健全。此補劑之最有效果者，據各醫師臨床報告，以「米美爾補腦汁』Memory　Neurlfc為可靠。因腦爲人身的主宰，神經系統的中樞，吾人之精神與體力，均由腦筋產生的緣故，是以服用「米美爾補腦汁」能恢復神經的活力，服後即覺頭腦淸爽，精神愉快，思想靈敏，血氣紅潤，身心允爲活潑，使嬴弱的身體，萎靡的精神，將一變而爲蓬勃有生氣的新活力，走上康健的光明之路</p>
<h3 id="c108">一個年青的男子這樣說 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 香伯譯　George　Foley　M.D.作</p>
<p>「對啦，先生！是我，很快的就洩了﹔我很驚異的，如果這就是靑年時候錯誤的結果，怎辦呢，」一個三十多歲失意的男子呻吟對我這樣說。簡說起來，這位男子是感覺他的性慾的快樂全部消失，因爲他在得着性行爲的美點以前就洩精了。然後，他自己慚愧，受了多數女人的恥笑。親愛的讀者們，你們曾發生這樣事情嗎？如果牠有可憐的地方，讓我告訴你，我們男性裏百分之五十到百分之七十五受這種煩腦。現在你們有這種痛苦嗎？不，我不希望這句話是對的。</p>
<p>有人會告訴過你性交的時間嗎？以我的學識，沒有一個人能的，並且這也沒有更深奧的意旨在性生活的硏究上。不要驚奇，在男女兩性交接時，有許多致病的原因。在討論這種問題以前，必須理解兩性——男人和女人——的正常的關係。雙方都有相等性的滿足的權利。當兩性絕對的實行相等的企圖，男性就該放棄了古老觀念，女人不是永遠被動的，冷感的，事實上，她也有時候如火山的熱烈，滾水之沸騰。</p>
<p>喲，讓我們注視普通的人性行爲以後，看他怎樣張開嘴唇的微笑，怎樣的意氣揚揚的神情，並且還要說：「世界是爲而有　「你仔細看去，他還在追尋着：「我剛才使一個女人得着了快感。」事實上，他想也恩惠道位女人了？其實，她沒有得到一點快感﹔很快的，她變成神經病似的好像得之於性交不滿足的結果。性是一種有力的東西，牠當一方面受抨，絕不能因循下去；然而許多做妻子的沒有方法來抗議丈夫短的時間的熱情，恐怕受了淫猥的譏笑，多麼憂愁啊。</p>
<p>社會的天慕，展開了一幅新的圖畫，我們的離婚法庭，變成妻子的困惱境遇他們拒絕由於丈夫的早洩自己成爲慢性患病者。具有深切研究的聰明的裁判官，知道其中所蒙蔽的確切原因。朋友們！你必須知道幽嫻銳感的女人，絕不能這樣喊出：「我的丈夫是陰萎的」！多一半她們是沉靜的，最來變成「我是瘋狂了！」其中的，太也顯而易見了。</p>
<p>「我怎能使我的丈夫變成强壯？」一位高尚的婦人問我：「如果沒有方法來治療他，他就要使我憂鬱，使我昏迷。因爲我的丈夫是一個高尚的人品，所以我欲願帮助他。」讀者們！如果你的丈夫或者你自己是確實的早洩患者，不必憂慮，更不必猶豫，趕快的取用內分泌聯合製劑「還爾童」WILL　TONIC的一種補片內服，這是最有效的療法，並且意義，顯然的是丈夫的早洩，給她的效果。這樣的搆成實行不知道是幾千萬個。</p>
<p>一位醫生由於經騐得來說：「因爲一個男人洩精較早，就是陰萎，你以爲這確是眞實的意義嗎？像這樣的男人也可以得着小孩。」對啦！這種意思可以偶然發生是對的；但在理論上講，像這樣的男人性慾是衰弱了！如果他們不能使妻子得着快感，她們有時候互相詢問別人的女人，尚能帮助她，但絕對不能詢問男人的，因爲他是太驕傲了。</p>
<p>愚鈍的丈夫們，絕不信仰他的妻子，他是寧肯按照他們自已的意見，這就是性知識愚鈍的收塲。好啦！我們不阻止做丈夫的了。他進入神聖婚姻的牀上以後，很快的接近他的妻子，射精的速度和退却的緊急，無可比擬。這並不是性慾的性交，是上帝純潔愛的凌辱，對於女更不是美滿的事情，將來兩人必獲酷報。不必奇怪，多數的女人被指爲冷感，不然她們又能怎的！「男人永遠不諒解女人」，這是一句古語，稍有偏袒的地方；我想，在極短的時間，可以試騐瞭解女人的本性；但是直到我們從愚蠢的觀念解放後，我們是不能相反的，男性和女性的關係在世界裏最美麗和最神聖了。</p>
<p>男人們，必須瞭解這點和拋棄一切的殘忍。愛要純潔，革除一切虛僞，更不要以解决自己性慾爲目的，妻子的本性，在每决的性交，都是期待着快樂。你必須驅遂所有以前的恐怖和失敗，你害你的妻子，使她瘋在，和責難，記住！像這的恐怖，都是早洩促成的結果啊。</p>
<p>當你接近你的妻子時候，從容的，鎮靜的要得着充足的愛，並且還要練習要有一種拘束。熱烈到極點，要收回來，休息片刻，甚至放讓牠完全平靜，這些經騐的事實，時常讓她和你的心靈發在，得着美滿的快感。</p>
<p>你問我，愛的快感有多長時間，據近代的考察多數都在二三分鐘的爲數尚很少了。這些片刻纏綿的熱烈男子和柔弱的性的刺激的女人很安全沒有一些流弊如速續服用數星期，必定能得性交恢復充分愉快的效果。</p>

<p>諸位小朋友：廢話休講吧，未來的責任，要我們來担負。新的國家，急待我們來創造。從今天起，大家快快培養豐富的智識，鍜鍊健全的體魄。準備在不久的將來，爲祖國出力，爲民族爭光，做一番轟轟烈烈的大事業，復興我們的國家吧。</p>

<p>春天是一個可愛的季節！滿處開着香噴噴的花朶，太陽光又是這麼的溫暖。小朋友們，這是你們快樂的日子啊！</p>
<p>春天旣然與嚴寒的冬天不同，所以也應該有不同的戶外運動。現在把最適宜於春天的戶外運動，開列在下面：</p>
<p>遠足　遠足就是會集了幾個小朋友，跑到郊外去溜躂的意思。在遠足的時間裏，小朋友們可以採採野花，捉捉蝴蝶，還可以呼吸草原上的新鮮空氣。如果帶點食物在郊外野餐，那當然是更有意義了</p>
<p>爬山　爬山是一種强身的運動。小朋友們住的地方如果有山，就是小小的丘陵也好，儘可邀了幾個同志，比賽一下誰爬得快，誰爬得高。這樣，不但可以藉此强健身體，還可當作一種很有趣的競賽</p>
<p>放風箏　放風箏大槪是小朋友們最熟識的玩意兒吧？春天就是一個最適宜於放風箏的季節。小朋友可以隨便找到一塊曠地，放一隻蜈蚣形的，或是蝴蝶形的風箏在半空上飛呀飛的，便可以過一天快活日子了。</p>

<p>—蘇俄的兒童鐵道—</p>
<p>在黑海與裹海中間，蘇俄聯邦的喬其亞境內，有個錢佛黎士公園。公園裹面，有一條著名的「兒童鐵道」。長一千二百英尺，有兩個車站。從開始建築的工程人員，直到現在駕駛的機務人員，都是兒童們親自担任的。不過由一個有經騐的鐵路工程師指揮罷了。</p>
<p>這條兒童鐵道，開車已經三個月，曾經有六萬五千個乘客坐過這個兒童火車。</p>
<p>這一批兒童建築工團曾經赴京訪問。莫斯科鐵路人民委員會主席喀根諾夫克親自招待，威到非常的興趣。</p>
<p>最近正在計劃從鐵佛黎公園的兒童鐵道展長起來，由五百個兒童建築一條長三千英尺的山洞鐵道，連一個設備完全的車站。不久便要開始建築。</p>
<p>兒童是最富於服務精神的；他們從不會得偸懶。兒童是最富於建設興趣的；他們從不畏懼困難。</p>
<p>兒童怎樣纔能有所建設呢？</p>
<p>第一要有良好的指導；第二要有集團的組織。中華民國的兒童，如其有良好導師，有相當組織，他的建設能力，决不會在蘇俄的兒童之下的罷。</p>
<p>我們也應該有些兒童們自己出力的新建設！莫要辜負了這偉大的兒童年！</p>

<p>小朋友們，當你在低的地方，而要看到高處的東西，那當然是件很不容易的事。現在我可以告訴你自製一隻潛望鏡，這樣你就得解决上面的那個難題了。</p>
<p>預備二方塊同樣大小的鏡子，和一隻高十八吋至二十四寸的長方木匣，或是用硬紙板製成亦可。其尺寸的大小得按你的二方鏡子來决定，在長匣的兩頭依（圓一）開洞。　和　是鏡子。　是景物光綫的射入處。　是由上面景物反映下來的光綫。上下兩塊鏡子的置放，都須傾倒，成爲四十五度的角位。在紙匣的裹面，完全塗以黑色，便减少不需要的陽光，而加增光綫的淸晰。第二圖是製成援的形式。不過最應注意的，就是二方鏡子的置放要相等，才能得到正確的景物。</p>

<p>— 南匯祝橋小學學生　金秀梅</p>
<p>我最快樂的日子，是久別的爸爸回來的那天。在過去的幾年間，我的爸爸是在上海市立的中小學校裹敎書的，兩地的距離很遠，來回一决，差不多要四五天。所以爸爸回來的决數很少，一年之中只有二三决，家庭裏常常很寂寞。等到爸爸回來的時候？那就多麼快樂呀！家庭充着許多的笑聲，充着親熱的談話聲，一切的一切，都流露生動的姿態，平日的蕭索氣象，完全消失了</p>
<p>爸爸回來的時候，帶着許多的玩具，糖果，書籍……等，分給我們。那些玲瓏的玩具，香美的糖果，趣味的書籍，……我和弟弟看的看，吃的吃，玩的玩，心花不由的大放起來。</p>
<p>爸爸有空閒的時候，呌我們都到他的跟前，他似乎很高興地把國家的大事，地方的新聞，一樁樁很詳細地給我們聽。由於事情的悲，歡，離，合，使得我們發生着異樣的情緒。我們歡迎爸爸的這種談話，是十分的熱烈。</p>
<p>爸爸在外面做事，我們偶然碰到氣候冷熱的劇烈轉變，却不知道爸爸的健康怎樣，總是深深的想念着。現在好了，眼看回來的爸爸，精神抖擻，容光煥發，這時我內心上的安慰，眞是不可以言語形容哩。</p>
<p>總之：爸爸回來的日子，是我最快樂的一天。</p>

<p>會走的小紙船</p>
<p>有一位小朋友說我可以做一隻不要舵，也用不着布帆的小船，它會在水面上行走，好像隻小輪船似的，這是多末有趣囉。我們要求他敎大家來玩，他就來玩了。他說，玩這個把戲所用的材料，很簡單。我昨天到一爿藥舖子裹去，買了一百文的樟腦粉。洋信紙，剪子和臉盆，自己家裹都是有的。現在，我來做兩隻一寸長的小紙船兒，小林！你去拿隻面盆，打一滿盆淸水來，我只要把船的尾巴上，剪一個缺口（如圖），然後慢慢的很平衡的把這兩隻小紙船放下水去，立刻撮一點兒樟腦粉放在船尾巴的缺口上，就行啦！眞的；小紙船在水裹向前走起來了！它們自動的繞着盆走得很長久。缺口處的樟腦粉沒有了，小紙船就停着不走，好像小輪船沒有油了。它要加點油似的。他把小紙船撈起來，小林又帮着他去換了一盆新鮮的淸水來。再把紙船放進去，撮一點兒樟腦粉在缺口上，船立刻又仍舊繼續的走起來了。這是多末有趣囉，小林追問着他說，爲什麼要在缺口上，放一點兒樟腦粉才會走呀？他回答不來。在這時候，我就告訴他說：</p>
<p>樟腦是從一種樟腦樹裹蒸出來的油叫做樟腦油，再從樟腦油煉成的結晶。樟腦有一種强烈的香味，在平常的溫度中，它也會揮發變成氣逃走。放在酒精，揮發油，脂肪油裹，都容易溶解。但放在水裹，不容易溶解。</p>
<p>這種樟腦一放在水面就起旋轉，這是因爲樟腦和水發生化學變化，把船推走了。你們如果繼續研究化學的把戲，就可以懂得更多一些。</p>

<p>他從來不知道甚麼叫做輪廓和陰陽，也不知道剖視的方法，然而他靠着自己的天才和毅力，耐心的畫去，終於把這畫像畫成了。那畫面上孤單的寂寞的老樵夫，委實是一首很好的詩，坐在那枯樹上，靜靜地好像在那裏想甚麼心事似的。他的後面是一抹黃昏的夜色，把老人罩住了。這幅畫當然是很粗率的，並且也有不少弱點；然而好在一個眞字，在這上面可以見到自然界的眞和美術上的眞，在慘淡中含有無窮的美麗。母天工作完畢之後，柏德希往往靜躺在這裹，看它的小主人一些些的忍耐地做他的工作，前後也不知道挨過多少鐘點了。它知道小南洛有一個希望，可說是沒有甚麼把握的，原來他一心想畫成了這幅畫，送出去參與比賽，想得到每年二百法郞的獎金。這比賽就在盎凡雨舉行，凡是十八歲以內的孩子，無論是學生也好，農家子也好，只要能够作畫，將鉛粉和鉛筆畫成的作品送去，由三羅本城中的大畫家担任評判，選定一個最有天才的小畫家，給他獎金二百法郞。</p>
<p>這一年春夏秋三季，小南洛打起了精神，在這一張畫上工作着，要是大功告成，奪得了錦標，那麼對於他的自立運動接近了一步，而他的愛好那神秘的藝衛自有一種熱烈的情緒的。</p>
<p>他嚴守着秘密，並不告知人家：他的祖父不會了解這回事，而和小愛珞又疎遠了。他只對着柏德希訴說了一切，低低的說道：「我想那第一名的獎金，羅本士一定會賞給我的。」</p>
<p>所有參加比賽的畫件，限定十二月一日都要送去的，評判的結果也已規定在二十四日那天發表，因此他要是得獎的話，那麼到了耶穌聖誕日，就可同他的老祖父和柏德希快樂一下了</p>
<p>在一個嚴冷的冬日，剛天明的時候，他的心突突地跳着，一會兒充滿了希望，一會兒充滿了恐怖，把那幅畫放在送牛乳的綠色小車上，由柏德希帮助着，一塊兒送到鎭中去，直到那一座公共大厦門前。他怯生生地暗晤想道：「也許這一幅畫一個錢都不値，誰知道呢？」他留下了那畫，自己也覺得是一件冒險而沒有意識的事，試想像他這麼一個赤脚的窮小子，連字都不識的，怎麼能引起那些大畫家來看他這種幼稚的作品呢？</p>
<p>他很高興的走過大禮拜寺，彷彿瞧見那古代大畫家羅本氏的影兒，很偉大，很莊嚴的現在幽暗的運河中，他的嘴唇上含着慈和的微笑，似乎在喃喃地說道：「不要怕！我當初在盎凡爾掙我的畫名時我的心中也是充滿了勇氣的。」小南洛在這寒冷的黑夜中跑回家去，得到了無窮的慰安。</p>
<p>他已盡了他的能力，其餘的事情只得聽上帝作主了。原來他常在那楊柳和白揚叢中的小禮拜堂裹，一心崇拜聖主，立下了一種不可搖動的信仰心。</p>
<p>冬天的氣候早已寒冷極了。這夜他們回到了家中，大雪紛飛，一連下了好幾天，把村中的路徑和田間的阡陌完全掩沒了，所有的小河和溪渠全都冰凍，平原上也冷得可怕。在這樣的寒冬，淸早出去送牛乳確是一件很困苦的事情，那時天還沒有放光，全世界一片漆黑，而他們就在黑暗中把牛乳送到那寂靜的鎮中去。</p>

<h3 id="c174">常州的蠶桑事業 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 克凡</p>
<p>「四月鄉村閒少，纔了蠶桑又揷田一。」今年春天似較往年寒冷，可是在江浙各地農村，却已經在開始「養蠶忙」了</p>
<p>常州在江蘇的版圖裹面，要算是一個很重要的養蠶區域，每年蠶繭的輸出，價値也有數十萬元；所以養蠶雖是農村副業，然而在這裏的農村却算是一筆大宗的進項呢！這裏蠶期每年分春秋兩期，每期蠶種的十二萬張，結繭的四萬餘擔，若以每擔三十元計之，每期當得十餘萬元，世有時雨水得宜，桑田豐收，却還不止此數。不過過去鄉民養蠶多用舊法，致蠶繭的質地頗不能一致；而「催靑」（催靑卽烘蠶）時耗費人力允多。所以常州在前年便成立了一個蠶桑改良的機關，由各縣分區辦理；牠的性質是專門培植養蠶入材及指導養蠶事業。</p>
<p>常州蠶桑改良區設在縣城；奔牛，橫林，戚墅堰，束岱，東唐，下弋橋，蠡河橋，各鎭都設有蠶桑指導所，專司「催靑」及指導飼蠶工作。每所有指導員二人或三人，大都由蠶桑專門學校學生或已畢業的學員擔任，一共有四十多個人，每月經費聽說要二千元左右；辦事的房屋大都由各「鎭公所」供給，這都是不必花什麼房租的。</p>
<p>這班指導員的工作，說起來就是變相的「養蠶娘」，這種工作很是繁重，允以在「催靑」開始時爲甚。這裹「催靑」開始期是四月七日，正式上「蠶架」時却是十日；從「催靑」到「進匾」——卽竹製匾箕——要十天才祇完成，如果天暖，就祇需七天够了。「催靑」的溫度，在十天中是逐日不同；第一天的六十二度，以援逐日增加，直到七十八度，便是「孵種」的最後一天了。</p>
<p>「催靑」另外有一間房子。裹面的佈置很簡單，有一只三角形的木架，上面一格格地都放着竹扁箕，底下有一隻舊式的火盆，壁上掛有一隻寒暑表；這麼幾件用具，便是孕育千百萬條小生命的「母體」。房問的四壁窗戶都用紙糊得密密層層，一絲風也鑽不進去；地面上舖着方磚，便於洒水，這便是所謂「補濕」。在這房間裹的工作人員，一天到晚都不能離開這裹一步，他們工作時的「準繩」，全靠那壁上掛着的那隻寒暑表；天氣寒冷時，便得燒炭火增加房間裹的熱度，反之，又得在地上洒水「補濕」，使溫度下降；一時一刻都得留心溫度的升降，使牠保持平衡的狀態。</p>
<p>「催靑」開始的這天——七日——當地的鄉民都到指導所來定購蠶種，蠶種分「盒裝」與「紙版」兩種；「裝種」又名「洋種」，乃是用一個長五寸寬三寸的木框，兩面糊着紗布，形和烟盒相彷，所以才有這名稱。「紙版種」便是一張像日歷牌般大小的厚紙，上面畫有十二個圓圈，每圈裹都分佈着若干蠶種，驟然看去，有如一只平面的地球儀。這兩種蠶種的售價一律四角。由指導所代爲「催靑」，不另收費，不過遇有時蠶種過多了，得酌收炭火費若干。鄉民定好蠶種，寫上了自己的名字援，便把蠶種交給指導員代為「催靑」。照這裹章程規定，如蠶種超過兩張至八張，須由蠶戶派一人到指導所帮助，若有十張以上，就得派兩人。蠶戶派來實習的人，對於養蠶一切的手續須絕對聽指導員的指示，如「催靑」，「補濕」，「裝扁」，「上葉」，「上山」——結繭期——等等，都一反從前的舊法。據說在剛開辦的時期，一般鄉民都不明瞭科學育蠶的好處，多半對這種養蠶方法表示懷疑，害得一班指導員說得舌敝層焦，而還不能使他們相信，因此到指導所來購種的人也就寥寥無幾；但經過一年的事實表現，才使一般愚頑無知的蠶戶嘆服了。今年的蠶戶向指導所購種的却異常踴躍，從七日至十日止，據說整個常州已經銷掉新種有十二萬張之多，這是往年所未有的現象；不過，各處指導所的工作入員，却也忙得「不亦樂乎」，雖然還有蠶戶協助。</p>
<p>蠶戶在指導所實習時期最多是十天，如遇氣候溫暖却祇需七天左右，到了幼蠶「進扁」，便各自回去飼育，同時，第二批「催靑」的蠶戶也就接着上來了；所以「催靑」期雖規定十天，但指導員的工作却兩倍於此數的。等到所有的蠶戶請託催靑都告了結束，指導員的工作才算達到第一步的完成。第二步工作的開始，便是到曾經由指導所「催靑」的蠶戶家裹指導飼育，察看桑葉的水分，溫度的高低，蠶種的演化；這許多情形，都得逐一塡入表格。這種工作較之「催靑」還要艱難，因爲各鄉蠶戶的居處都極遠僻，山路崎嶇，每天從甲村到乙村或丙村，動輒就得走五六里或十餘里的路程。每天上午六時左右卽須從所裏出發，脚力健的一天也不過走上三五處村莊；如果遇着天雨或吹風，那簡直是費盡了氣力也跑不到三處蠶戶。這樣過了二十多天，才挨到「上山」的時期，然而繁忙的工作却又相逼而來了，原因是蠶兒「上山」大都不過距離一兩天，在這短促而功行又將圓滿的最援期中，簡直是一處都小敢輕易放過，縱然有時因爲時間關係分身不開，但一般蠶戶却也不肯讓指導員不來工作的。所以在這「上山」時期，一班指導員便都變成了「香噴噴」似的，蠶戶雖花消了豐肥的招待也在所不惜，不過一班指導員却適得其反地忙得連吃飯的工夫也沒有。「上山」時期，前援大的需七天，在這時的指導員每天要替蠶戶們檢騐病蠶，又要指導他們整理「稻藁」——蠶兒「上山」所用——。所謂稻藁是拿稻桿切成尺餘長短，分作兩把，當中繞上草繩，形和「脆毛花」相似，不過粗大却有數倍。等到蠶到了「上山」的時候便把牠拿來放在「稻藁」上，讓牠去作繭自縛！指導員的工作到了這裹才算全部完成，計共費時四十餘日。</p>
<p>指導員的工作都在春秋兩季，因此她們的報酬也是按季發給，簡單地說，就是包工制。一個初出學校的指導員，每季的薪水——連伙食在內——的六十元，有了兩年經騐或是平時在學校的成績優良的，就有八十元至八十五元一季的薪水。常州蠶桑區今年派出的指導員，據說有四十位，內中有三分之一是蠶桑學校未卒業的學生，由學校派出來跟隨實習的；此項練習生的薪水，每人都一律三十元，除掉旅費及伙食共需十餘元外，其餘的數目都得交給本校充作學校的經費。這班指導員除了拿正項薪水而外，據說還有一種成績的獎賞，不過數目的多少却是沒有一定凖則的。</p>

<h3 id="c176">論小品文 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 嫻女士</p>
<p>小品文是近代文學的寵兒，她受一羣文學者的歡愛。確實，她有被可愛的內在的力量的。允其是現在一般文學靑年，都在學習着小品文的寫作，小品文的被重視是無庸疑義的了。然而小品文的本質究竟怎樣？這一問題大概是每一個作者所想要理解的吧！</p>
<p>小品文是什麼？在國內已有許多學者論列過，但很難找得一個我們所能滿意的確當理解。</p>
<p>西洋文學中，對於這類文體的作品叫做Essay，也有採用美衛裏的所謂Sketch，作爲這一種文體的名稱的。Essay，周作人先生譯作「論文」，「美文」，實在不怎樣妥當。LF.Young曾對於文藝的Essay作過這樣的一段解釋：「文藝的Essay，介於小說作品與蛟嚴正的科學的哲學的論文之問，佔着一個利便的地位。牠是適應於任何的題目，應用一種暢快的，輕鬆的，顯豁的形式報告出來，並提出一種論點的檢討之範國，而是作者在任何題旨上發表思想的一種可愛慕的工具。」雖然他把小品文的性質解釋了一點，但對於小品文的整個認識還是不够的。</p>
<p>比較確當，要推夏丐尊先生的話：「從外形的長短上說，二三百字乃至千字以內的短文稱爲小品文。長文和小品文只是由外形而定。因此小品文的內容性質全然自由，可以叙事，可以含議論，可以抒情，可以寫景，毫不受何等的限制。……小品文，我國古來早已有了。如東坡小品就很有名。普通的所謂隨筆也可看作小品的一種。近來在各國小品文更盛行；並且體裁和我國向來的所謂小品文大不相同。現在的所謂小品文實即Sketch的譯語。大概都以片斷的文字表現實感或實生活的一部分的。」</p>
<p>馮三昧在小品文講話裏也有較精到的解釋：「所謂小品文就是指這內容單純外形短小的文字而言。小品文也可以叙事說理，但其本質實以抒情爲主。情之熱烈而深切的，可以造成種種的長篇大作，但是如果沒有這般熱切，而也是以代表實生活的一角的，想要將它保留下來不讓其貿然的消失，那麼，小品文眞是無上的工具了。小品文形式雖是散文，性質實近於詩歌。它不能像尋常文字那樣的　散，也不能像一般詩歌那樣的緊湊。如果散文詩外，還有介於詩歌與散文之間的中和地域，那它便是這地域上的一種新的花朶了。」</p>
<p>胡適之先生也有幾句可注意的話，他說：「用平淡的談話，包藏著深刻的意味，有時」很像笨拙，其實確是滑稽。」這裏所說的滑稽似乎頗多語病，也落於淺薄，宜改爲幽默或諧趣，因爲幽默和諧趣都是小品文裏應具的條件。　綜合起來說，應得下面一個較完美的結論：小品文是以精悍的諧趣的雋永的文字，輕快的技巧，表現和批評人生之一角或片斷的實感的短文。</p>
<p>小品文在文藝的園地裹是幽默的一個僻境，並不像古人所說的那麼寬廣和遼闊，鐘敬文先生曾說：「……古人於小品云云，似指的是些篇幅不長的文章，其體裁兼有論說，序跋，傳記，銘誌等，內容則寫景，叙事，抒情，議論都齊備。依此，實和平常所謂文章沒有什麼分別，只是短篇罷了。」</p>
<p>小品文不就是短篇，小品文自有風格上的特徵。日本作家廚川白村在他的出了象牙之塔一書中說：「如果是冬天，便坐暖爐旁邊的安樂椅子上，倘在夏天，便披浴衣，啜香茗，隨隨便便，和好友任性閒話，將這　話照樣地移在紙上的東西就是Essay興之所至，也說些不至於頭痛的道理，也有冷嘲，也有警句，旣有Humor（滑稽），也有Pathoo（感奮），所談的題目，天下國家的大事不待言，還有市井的瑣事，書籍的批評，相識者的消息，以及自己過去的追懷，想到什麼就縱談到什麼，而託於即興之筆者，是這一類文章。」，這已很足够說明小品文的風格及其題材的來源了。</p>
<p>這里我們得將小品文與其他文藝作品作一個比較：</p>
<p>一·小品文與詩歌　小品文雖常富有抒情的抒述，就是那一種富有詩意的小品文。但詩畢竟不就是小品文，詩是依據韻律爲必要條件的，小品文則吾。</p>
<p>二•小品文與小說小品與小說，從牠們的結構，表現方法各方面都可分別出牠們的差異。小說從攝取題材之後，須經過相當布局，有嚴格的結構，人物，背景，對話，叙事，都曾經過了一番推敲，然後用經濟的技巧表現出來的。小品則不然，上面已經說過，牠是用「即興」的方法來表現其合于目的的人生之一角；牠的結構不能如小說一樣嚴格。</p>
<p>三•小品與論說文　小品有時也是事理或意象方面的論說。有不少小品文是以冷冽嚴峻的筆鋒針對着某一事理之正面，或以冷嘲熱諷的口吻從側面輕敲側擊，讀者覺得另有一種淸寒的氣息襲人肺腑。但小品文到底不就是論說文，因爲牠仍然根據于牠即興的技術的，並沒有嚴正的結構使成論說文應具的形式。</p>
<p>四•小品文與戲劇　有時小品文作者也利用戲劇的形式和簡單的對話方法，來完成他小品文的抒寫，但這樣的例子却很少。例如陳衡哲女士的運河與揚子江，我們始終認爲是一篇品文，沒有當牠爲戲劇。</p>
<p>五•小品文與日記　普通小品文的形式，出于閒話或隨筆的體例的，要算最多，但有一種特殊的形式！日記與書信</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>，也佔着重要的位置。郁達夫先生說：日記文學是文學里的一個核心，是正統以外的一個寳藏。日記小品之所以感人極深，正因爲她是眞情的流露，用不着做作，她是渾樸無　的白璧。</p>
<p>六•小品文與書信書信體的小品文也是文學中的珍品。周作人先生說日記和尺牘是文學中特別有趣味的東西，因爲比別的文章更鮮明地表出作者的個性。冰心女士的寄小讀者，溫柔綺麗的辭藻，天眞濃部的情精，許多讀者都爲之愛不釋手，他如郭沫若田漢宗白華三人的三葉集，他們如何討論着人生問題呢？剛直，雄偉，哀婉，充滿了熱烈緊張的情緒，也是很好的小品文。</p>
<p>七·小品文與散文詩　在某一種情形下，小品文與散文詩簡直沒有清晰的境界可分。我們很知道有不少小品文中含有十分的詩意，而構造形式也並不怎樣異於散文詩，木村毅說：「不可忘了散文能夠有今日之發達，有不少地方借用了」詩的工夫和技巧。」木村毅曾舉了一個詩與散文的境界的例子：　終日；　從朝到晚；　從掛着朝霧的時候起到蟋蟀鳴的時候止。　　只能表現日常一切的簡明事態，不能當作傳達特殊思想感情的表現。　的表現，就進到了一個另外的世界了。牠並不直接表現內容，而以暗示的方法使讀者自己去把握潛藏於記述的底蘿的內容。小品文是適用（三）的表現的，牠需要色彩的渲染，趣味的濃厚，以及文學的情趣。所以我們可說小品文是「詩的散文」。</p>
<p>這里我們想肘論小品文對於多數作者的貢獻及其內在價値之估計：</p>
<p>第一，對於作者的價値</p>
<p>甲，培養技衛——要成爲一個技衛成熟的作家，開始不能立即寫作長篇或巨製，長篇或巨製是較繁重的工作；小品文取材旣容易，構造又輕便，經過相當時期的練習，技衛自然靈活了。</p>
<p>乙，開拓思路——從日常生活里描繪人生之一角，作者因實感的寫作，興趣橫生，文思如幽谷之淸泉，源源不絕。</p>
<p>丙，增加生活的吟味能力——文學的能事是表現人生，是批評人生。小品文同樣是實生活的表現與批評。故要作小品文，一定要吟味自己的實生活，理解自己實生活的情趣，然後才能表現生活。</p>
<p>丁，養成敏銳的觀察力！—文學的表現是深刻的人生橫心的發掘，我們應養成敏銳的透視生活或社會各階層，衡量自我的理想。</p>
<p>第二，內在價値之估計</p>
<p>甲，自我色彩之擴展——這里不一定是冷酷的呆板的客觀記錄，而是另一種極濃重的個性調子在彈奏着。</p>
<p>乙，剎那浮現之執着——當人類的息想與情緒剎那的浮現時，把牠把握住，從我們這簡短的小品中不放走這剎那的甜蜜。</p>
<p>總之，小品文不是載道的大文章，不是無病的呻吟，而是一切人生社會宇宙之正面或側面之寫照，是技衛宮中的一件珍物。</p>
<p>言論</p>
<h3 id="c177">想到麥唐納和赫理歐的下塲 <a href="#c177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— 吉仁</p>
<p>當麥唐納在英國落選，與跟着來的法國赫理歐失掉急進社會黨黨魁地位的消息傳出援，在一個外國雜誌上曾刋出了一幅富有諷刺意味的漫畫。那漫畫所表現的是麥唐納的狼狽下台，赫理歐打着一把洋傘，狼狽地緊跟在麥唐納的屁設援面，走上同一的途徑。我看了這樣的漫畫之後，自然覺得好笑，但同時更使我不能不佩服作畫者腦筋的靈活，他能那樣無情地嘲笑了在英法政治舞台上專門賣野人頭的兩個政客所遭的悲慘的命運。</p>
<p>麥唐納本來是英國的工黨領袖，他曾利用過英國一部份工人的力量，作了兩次工黨內閣的首相；一般看凍，可說是英國政治舞台上最活躍的人物之一了。但在一九三一年當英國在財政上發生空前的困難時，麥廣納爲了英帝國主義的安寗，圖謀打開財政難關，竟不情公然離開他自己的工黨，與保守黨相勾結，伏貼在鮑爾溫的懷抱里。這樣一來，當然要爲他所屬的工黨所唾棄，爲原來尚對他抱有好戚的一部份英國人所恥笑，結果是在這屆英國的選舉中大受選民的責罵，竟自落了選。援來雖然由於鮑爾溫的可憐他，在現在英國內閣中得了一個位置，但從今以後，這位曾經出過大風頭的政客的政治生命便算完了，他的眞面目已完全顯露了出來，他將不能再欺屬他所欺騙過的人羣了；他的命運只有終身待奉鮑爾溫，或者爲英國人民拋棄在廢物堆里，從此湮沒無聞！</p>
<p>至於赫理歐，也是法國頂有名的人物。他原是法國最大政黨——急進社會一黨的黨魁；曾任法國內閣總理；從一九〇五年起他就關始任里昻市長，一直繼續到現在，法國人呼之爲「市長之王」；這當然可說是近年來法國政治舞臺上最紅的人物了。但當賴伐爾內閣時，他便首先違背急進社會黨的意志，支持賴伐爾違反民意的政策，結果引起了自己黨的反對，被迫辭去黨魁的地位。這便是一他走上麥唐納所走的道路第一步的表現一。最近法國衆議院選舉初决揭曉，「出人意表」的赫理歐竟告落選，據說這是「法國歷史上的創見」。自然，他在這决選舉中的命運，還要在五月三日的第二次投票中才能完全確定，但這决初選的失敗總是法國人民在繼續給與他的敎訓，總是他的政治地位在繼續下落的表現；卽使在第二决投票中他僥倖當選了，那也不過是他在作最後的掙扎，在維持其殘餘的政治生命而已。不過，據報載，赫理歐在初選失敗後，已聲明「現擬退出政治，不再爲第二决選舉之候選人」；若然，那我們可以說赫理歐還算能「識時務」，能在人民對己不滿時不繼續戀棧，這此較起已經失敗了的麥唐納還要去乞憐鮑爾溫以維持一個官職的事來，可說是較勝一籌了。然而，不管怎樣，這兩位人物的命運總是一樣的。</p>
<p>由麥唐納和赫理歐所遭到的同一命運，使我們發生了兩個重要的感想；</p>
<p>第一，麥唐納本質上是改良主義，自由主義者。這樣的人物只能緩和現寳的生活爭鬬，根本就不能走上前進的道路；在某種情形下，他甚至可能去幹公然開倒車的勾當。所以，麥唐納當其還能繼續起欺騙的緩和作用時，他還可戴着改良的面具，努力和平的說敎；但是，現在”也不能起這樣的緩和作用了，他所領導的黨員已日益離開他而去走自已應走的道路了，因之他爲了自己個人的官位，便自動地撕去了他的面具，公然與保守黨勾結起來，去努力開倒車的工作。同時，赫理歐，也是保守的中間的自由主義者，他過去所領導的急進社會黨雖然有「急進」之名，但實際上却是法國市民的中間政黨。由於法國在上决大戰中得到了許多勝利品，社會比較安定，所以這個中間的法國市民政黨——社會急進黨所有的中間的溫和保守的政見，便獲得了多數法國人民的贊助，使這政黨成爲了法國最大的政黨，而這政黨的黨魁赫理歐也就成爲了法國政治上最出風頭的人物了。但最近法國因爲內外危機的發展，左右兩極端鬥爭的尖銳，中間的急進社會黨已逐漸失勢，連時代的尾巴都跟不上的那樣的赫理歐，在這法國的大時代中當然會要援退，甚至去與最保守的勢力結合，這是必然的。——依據這個分析，我們可以想到如像麥唐納和赫理歐那樣的人是最靠不住的：我們在結交朋友中，在社會活動中，應該餒密防備他們，以免被地們拍賣。</p>
<p>第二，麥唐納曾是英國工黨的領袖，赫理歐曾是法國急進社會黨的黨魁，他們過去的政治地位是他們的黨所給與，並不是他們個人創造出來的，所以，一旦他們背叛了自己黨的立塲，違反了自己黨的意志，也就同時喪失了他們固有的力量和地位。由此我們更可以想到入是社會的，集團的動物，個人的力量要在集團中才能生長，才能發揮，因而個人的出路也只有在集團的出路中才能找到，誰離開了他自己的集團而又找不到新的更好的集團參加，只是去獨行獨幹，或者依附於人，那是只有繼續使自己的靈魂墮落，走進沒有出路的牛角尖端的。麥唐納與赫埋歐之離開和違背他們的政黨，就斷送了自己的政治生命，甘地之從印度的民族解放運動中退却下來，便更快地喪失了他在印度人民中的威望，股汝耕等的叛國是遭到了全中國人民的唾駡，……這類的例子眞是舉不勝舉。</p>

<h3 id="e2">The Legislative Yuan Passes the National Assembly Representative Election Law: Allocation of Quotas Follows Central Principles; Overseas Chinese from the United States and the Philippines Each Receive One Additional Seat; Northeastern Provinces Included in Special Elections <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan convened its 59th meeting on the morning of the 2nd and continued deliberation on the National Assembly Representative Election Law. Sixty-one committee members were present, with Sun Ke presiding. The full text of the bill, consisting of 62 articles and four appendices, was read, revised, and passed in the third reading. However, regarding the division of electoral districts in various provinces in Appendix 2, Liu Guanxun, Zhang Weihan, Yang Gongda, and others had proposed amendments to the provinces of Shanxi, Yunnan, and Sichuan. The Yuan authorized a 24-member committee, including Lin Bin, Huang Youchang, Shi Weihuan, Lu Zhiyi, and Xu Yuangao, who had drafted the initial version, to consult with the internal representatives, reorganize the draft, and submit it directly to the President for approval and then to the National Government for promulgation. Fu Bingchang had already reported the drafting process in detail on the 1st. Lin Bin had also explained the allocation of representative quotas on the 1st, stating that the allocation followed central principles, with population size as the ratio. The population statistics were based on the household registration statistics compiled by the Ministry of Interior at the end of the 24th year and referred to the statistics reported to the Ministry this year. The minimum number of representatives for each province was nine, and the maximum was forty-four. The minimum number for each city was two, and the maximum was eight, to ensure that the quotas for each province and city did not differ too much, to prevent manipulation by provinces with larger populations, and to allow provinces and cities with smaller populations to jointly express their opinions on saving and building the country. The division of electoral districts in each province was based on the electoral district division table drafted by the Ministry of Interior, and the allocation of quotas for each electoral district was determined by the number of counties, cities, or administrative bureaus under its jurisdiction, in accordance with the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Founding Program, with each county electing one representative to participate in the legacy. The allocation of representative quotas for professional organizations was based on the reference materials from the Ministry of Industry for the survey of professional organizations in various provinces and cities, and the quotas allocated during the National Assembly were compared for appropriate allocation. The allocation of representative quotas for free professional organizations was also based on the reference materials provided by the Ministries of Interior, Industry, and Education. In the special elections, the allocation of representative quotas for the Northeastern provinces was handled according to central principles, and the Northeastern representative quotas were combined and distributed within the regional election quotas of various provinces and cities. Because their election methods were different, they were listed in the chapter on special elections. The allocation of representative quotas for Mongolia and Tibet adopted the opinions of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, with separate election procedures for those residing in and outside the region. The allocation of representative quotas for overseas Chinese adopted the opinions of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission and compared the regulations of the National Assembly Representative Election Law. The allocation of representative quotas for the military adopted central principles, and the election methods adopted the opinions of the Military Affairs Commission. All of the above allocations were carefully studied and can be said to be fair and appropriate. At the beginning of the meeting on the 2nd, the second reading was held. Article 1 was changed to Article 2, paragraph 2, due to the change in the National Assembly Organization Law. Lu Zhiyi proposed an amendment to Article 5, which was not approved. In Article 35, Fu Bingchang proposed that the election of overseas Chinese should consider the revolutionary history in addition to the population ratio, because the revolutionary history of China can be said to be related to overseas Chinese on every page, and that the overseas Chinese in the United States and the Philippines should be given priority. He advocated adding one seat each to the United States and the Philippines and subtracting one seat each from Malaya and Siam, which was unanimously passed. Zhou Wei and Yang Gongda stated that the article referred to overseas Chinese as representatives from foreign countries and treated Hong Kong and Macau as foreign countries, which would imply a loss of national sovereignty. They proposed an amendment, and Huang Youchang proposed changing "foreign countries" to "overseas," which was passed without objection. Hang Jintao requested to increase the number of Mongolian representatives, which was not passed. Wu Huanzhang expressed disagreement with the article on representatives from the Northeastern provinces, which was listed as a special election. The chairman replied that this was because the election methods were different and did not mean that the Northeastern provinces were regarded as special regions. Subsequently, some committee members proposed changing the chapter on special elections to "Other Elections," "Mixed Elections," or "Special Elections," and others proposed deleting the chapter on special elections and listing the various elections for the Northeastern provinces, Mongolia and Tibet, overseas Chinese, and the military as separate chapters. Because Li Zhonggong, Zheng Hongnian, and others strongly advocated maintaining the original draft, no amendments were made. Articles 35 to 62 were passed according to the original draft. Then, with unanimous agreement, the third reading procedure was omitted and passed. The meeting adjourned at around 12:00 noon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>Total Number of Representatives: 1,200</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Assembly Representative Election Law passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 2nd has eight chapters: General Principles, Regional Elections, Occupational Elections, Special Elections (divided into four sections: Elections in the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe; Elections in Mongolia and Tibet; Elections for Overseas Chinese; and Elections for the Military), Election Headquarters and Election Supervision, Election and Invalid Election, Election Litigation, and Supplementary Provisions.

The Yellow River post-disaster projects at breaches 1 to 5 have been repaired, and the sixth opening will also be completed soon. All the closure and completed projects will be handed over to Pan Yifen, the Shandong Provincial Government's handover commissioner, for handling. The post-disaster projects will be assisted by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the Shandong River Affairs Bureau.

The area was originally the only prosperous commercial center in western Shandong for the concentration and transportation of local products. Now it is a desolate scene. The land is one or two zhang or even several zhang higher than before. Single-story houses only show the rooftops, and multi-story buildings have become single-story houses. Only the top of the gate of the Fourth Primary School of Juancheng County remains, and only the top of the door and the top of the stele of the Meng Temple remain. They returned at 3:00 AM and reported to the Central Government on the inspection of the closure project. (Special dispatch on the 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Issue of Our Country Obtaining a Semi-Permanent Seat on the League of Nations Council <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>On the 27th of last month, the Committee on the Allocation of Council Seats of the League of Nations Administrative Council met in Geneva. After two days, it passed the recommendation of Lord Cecil, the British representative, and submitted a report to the Administrative Council proposing to increase the number of non-permanent seats on the Administrative Council from nine to eleven, with one of the newly added seats being granted to China, a country in the Asian continent, for a term of three years. This recommendation should be accepted by the upcoming Administrative Council meeting on the 11th of this month. By the time of the League of Nations General Assembly in September, China will likely re-enter the Administrative Council and occupy a council seat.</p>
<p>Why did the Committee on the Allocation of Council Seats of the Administrative Council recommend increasing the number of council seats and granting a seat to China? To explain this issue, we must mention the history of our country's bid for a seat on the League of Nations Council. Since joining the League of Nations, our country has been elected to the Administrative Council a total of three times, and has also failed to be re-elected or re-elected three times. The last time our request for re-election failed was in 1934. According to the method passed by the League of Nations, a non-permanent council member state that requests re-election within three years after the expiration of its term must first obtain the consent of two-thirds of the member states for the right to re-election before it can participate in the election. In fact, it is quite difficult to obtain a two-thirds majority of the votes. The year before last, our country's request for the right to re-election failed by a shortage of 21 votes. Since the right to re-election was not obtained, we were fundamentally unqualified to participate in the election. The Chinese government, in light of the lessons learned from the failure of the election the year before last, immediately changed its approach and submitted a request for a semi-permanent council seat at last year's League of Nations General Assembly. This request was not accepted by the League of Nations, but the Administrative Council only passed the organization of a 14-nation committee to discuss China's request and the allocation of council seats. This committee met last year to solicit opinions from the governments of various member states. Recently, it convened another meeting and passed a report recommending to the Administrative Council to increase the number of non-permanent council seats by two and grant one seat to our country. This is the origin of the resolution of the 14-nation committee. Whether the Administrative Council and the League of Nations General Assembly can accept the report of this subcommittee cannot be predicted at this time. However, judging from the recent situation, there is an 80% to 90% chance that our country will regain a seat on the non-permanent council after September.</p>
<p>Will China's upcoming election as a council member have any impact on ourselves and world peace? This depends on our own efforts in the future. We all know that the League of Nations was originally a group of powerful imperialists when it was first established. However, in recent years, due to the successive withdrawals of aggressors from the League of Nations and the accession of the Soviet Union and Turkey, the League of Nations has become a mechanism for mitigating the outbreak of war and an important factor in the collective security system. Therefore, China's upcoming election as a council member is naturally a manifestation of the increase in peaceful forces, because China is an extremely peace-loving country. However, the prestige and power of the League of Nations have been greatly diminished in recent years due to repeated destruction by aggressors, and China itself is a victim of aggressors. Not only can it not make much contribution to the League of Nations, but it also needs the League of Nations to help it. If we want the League of Nations to become a powerful mechanism for maintaining peace and an important pillar of the collective security system, and to be worthy of being a council member, we must first strengthen our own strength and be able to resist aggression and sacrifice for the future of peace. This will not only save ourselves from the depths of misery, but also indirectly increase the strength of the League of Nations and consolidate the power of the collective security system. If not, China's election as a council member will not have much practical significance.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Itagaki arrived in Tokyo on the 30th to attend the Chief of Staff Conference and meet with central figures such as Minister of the Army Terauchi, Chief of General Staff Nishio, and Director Umezu, reporting on the current situation on the border, the state of Soviet Russian Far East military preparedness, and proposing opinions on strengthening the Kwantung Army, and examining specific matters. Itagaki's visit to Tokyo today, accompanied by three staff officers, Takeshita, Hanaya, and Chida, reveals the importance of his mission. Regarding the current state of Japan-Manchukuo relations, Itagaki said: "The Soviet-Manchukuo border issue will be resolved by starting with the eastern border region, establishing a dispute settlement committee and a border demarcation committee to conduct diplomatic negotiations. The Soviet Union illegally extended the border line during the Fengtian warlord era and when Manchukuo's power had not yet reached the border. The Manchukuo government must clarify the truth about this." Negotiations on the Mongolia-Manchukuo border incident are currently being conducted using wireless telegraphy as a preliminary step. In connection with the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway (SMR), there are plans to unify the operation of all railways owned by the SMR, Manchukuo's railways, and Korean railways. Related authorities are considering the policy. (1st, Domei News Agency)</p>

<p>(London) The British Minister to Abyssinia, Mr. Barton, reported to the Foreign Office via wireless today that the Emperor had left the capital.  The city is now filled with cries and rampant looting, plunging it into a state of anarchy.  Most foreigners have now fled into the embassy area.  At the same time, the powerless radio station in the Abyssinian capital has also temporarily ceased communication this morning. Barton also stated that the embassy area in the Abyssinian capital is now in a dangerous state.  Therefore, Barton hopes that Italian troops can enter the city tomorrow to maintain order.  Currently, only 250 Indian infantrymen and five machine guns are responsible for maintaining the embassy area. Although there are obstacles such as barbed wire and enough food for three months, the defensive strength is far from sufficient.  It is said that the ministers of various countries here will return to their countries once the Italian troops arrive. According to today's news, the Italian troops have now advanced to Aijesa, 35 miles from the Abyssinian capital. (2nd National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Minister Bardun stationed in Abyssinia telegraphed that the Emperor, Empress, and Crown Prince have now left the Abyssinian capital for Djibouti. Before fleeing, they met at the British Legation, saying that organized resistance in Abyssinia was almost over. Gunfire and looting have now occurred in the Abyssinian capital. It is reported that the British Minister did not advise the Emperor to leave the capital, and the Emperor did not specify where he was going when he left. There are a thousand British people in the city, mostly Indians and Somalis, who have taken precautionary measures to protect themselves. As for the Caucasian British people still staying in the Abyssinian capital, there are only about thirty of them, who are said to have taken refuge inside the British Legation. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) The government received a telegram from Sir Baden, the Minister to Abyssinia, at 1:00 PM today, stating that the Emperor of Abyssinia now intends to lead the royal family and entourage through French-controlled Djibouti, taking a British warship to the British Mandate of Palestine, and specifically requested assistance. The government immediately consulted the French government on whether they had any objections to the Abyssinian Emperor's passage. The French government also replied that they had no objections, but stated that the Djibouti authorities were unable to prepare in time to provide effective protection for the Abyssinian Emperor's safety and hoped that the Emperor would not stay there. The British government has now dispatched a warship, ordering it to set sail immediately to Djibouti, in order to escort the Abyssinian Emperor to Palestine. (2nd Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: The Abyssinian government will move west. The Emperor met with the diplomatic corps this afternoon to discuss preventative measures to protect foreigners when Italian troops enter the city. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Emperor's flight from the Abyssinian capital has placed the League of Nations in an unprecedented predicament. League of Nations members are now very embarrassed. If the League of Nations Covenant is to be maintained, the League of Nations should continue to impose sanctions on Italy. However, Italy will now be able to forcefully argue that the Emperor is a usurper. It is expected that London and Paris will hold diplomatic consultations before the League of Nations Council meeting on May 11 to seek a kind of understanding, and will probably also consult with Italy.

<p>(Paris) According to a telegram from the Abyssinian capital this afternoon, Abyssinian soldiers shot down an Italian plane 20 miles from the capital. The plane caught fire upon landing, indicating that the Abyssinian capital has not yet fallen. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Our correspondent, Aochainat, reports that although Italian troops are currently advancing victoriously, approaching the Abyssinian capital, the Emperor suddenly returned to the capital today. His spirit of struggle remains as strong as ever. Recently, there have been many rumors and speculations about the Emperor's whereabouts. Some in Europe have even said that the Emperor had been killed at the front lines, which proves to be unfounded. Before entering the capital, the Emperor climbed a high hill outside the city, overlooking the entire city, and talked with various ministers and generals. He descended the mountain and entered the city at 4:00 PM, saying to our correspondent, "The Italian troops are still far from complete victory. Although the Italian troops on both the north and south routes have achieved victories in terms of depth, the breadth of our country is very wide from east to west. In terms of breadth, the Italian troops' progress is insignificant. You must know that there is more than one main road running across a country. If the enemy only advances along one of these roads, how can it be said that this country has been conquered?" However, although the Emperor has returned, those in charge do not conceal the seriousness of the current situation. It is generally believed that the Italian troops are currently heading straight for the Abyssinian capital, encountering no resistance along the way. Upon hearing the news of the Italian troops approaching the capital, foreigners in the capital were all greatly alarmed. European residents do not dare to stray far from their respective embassies, so that they can take refuge in the embassies when the Italian troops enter the city. The mayor and the police department have also prepared everything to maintain order. The embassies of various countries have also agreed to come forward to assist and provide protection when the time comes. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital: Before leading 5,000 members of the Imperial Guard to the mountains today, the Emperor met with reporters and stated that if necessary, "we will abandon the capital. This matter is not of great importance, because we will build a new capital in the south." He also said, "I am determined not to negotiate directly with the Italians. Our country will use the League of Nations as the only avenue for peace talks. I am determined not to abandon the country, but will all the countries of the world abandon my country and allow it to be controlled by evil fate?" He also said, "Abyssinia will never beg for peace. I am determined to reorganize my forces to fight the Italians. The war between us and the Italians is not only not over, but will continue from now on." According to reporters who witnessed the Emperor, the Emperor's appearance is now quite aged, his beard and hair are already gray, and both hands are bandaged with white cloth. It is said that this is the result of burns caused by Italian poison gas. (1st National Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) Many places in Italy are celebrating today upon hearing the news of the fall of the Abyssinian capital. The celebrations are especially lively in the north, with crowds gathering in the streets. All shops are closed and all houses are flying flags. Today's newspapers all printed in large letters the news that Italian troops are 60 miles from the Abyssinian capital, saying that the war, which began on October 3 last year, has lasted for seven months, and now Italian troops have reached the gates of the Abyssinian capital. Heavy rain and landslides on the front lines have blocked the Italian troops' advance. Engineers are now busy clearing the streets. Well-informed sources predict that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will announce new peace terms within days. (1st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) All the people of Italy expect to take the Abyssinian capital in a very short time. It is reported that two routes of Italian troops are now very close to the Abyssinian capital. Previously, heavy thunderstorms and landslides had blocked the road through the Tuma Bai mountain pass, which is 5,000 to 9,000 feet high, preventing the main force from advancing. Now, engineering teams have opened a road with shovels and explosives to allow heavy vehicles to pass. Italian East African Commander-in-Chief Badoglio has traveled south from Tai Xi to participate in the grand ceremony of the Italian troops entering the Abyssinian capital. It is reported that the railway between the Abyssinian capital and Djibouti has now been stopped. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Frontline news reports that a column of Italian troops on the southern route, led by General Nasi, has occupied the town of Daga Pu. This town is the last defensive line on the road to Harar. Now that it has fallen, the city of Harar has no defenses. As for the northern route, the Abyssinian capital can be taken in a very short time. Various Fascist groups here are now preparing to celebrate. However, the news that Italian troops have already entered the Abyssinian capital has been denied by those in charge. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) With the rapid advance of Italian troops in Abyssinia and the Abyssinian capital about to fall, political figures here believe that the Abyssinian resistance is extremely weak, and the time for Italy's decisive victory is not far away. It is likely that the Abyssinian government will move south to Gore, which is located in the mountains on the border between British Egypt and Sudan. The terrain is difficult and dangerous, allowing for a long-term defense. Even in the event of ultimate failure, due to its proximity to British territory, there is no need to worry about finding a place to seek refuge. At this time, official figures have not expressed their opinions on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but it is generally believed that the government definitely intends to end the dispute in the shortest possible time, because rumors of the merger of Germany and Austria are rampant. Although it is believed by most that German Fuhrer Hitler does not intend to take violent action, but intends to make a request to decide the future of Austria through a plebiscite by the Austrian people, the increasingly tense Manchurian diplomatic situation is difficult to deny. Britain's eagerness to end the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is a plan to devote all its attention to European issues. However, Lord Davis, a member of the House of Lords, will visit Foreign Secretary Eden next Monday on behalf of the joint League of Nations groups to propose a blockade of the Suez Canal, in the hope of cutting off Italy's transportation with East Africa. On the religious side, there is also increased pressure to intensify sanctions against Italy. Both of these will stimulate Italian emotions and make it difficult to resolve the dispute. Political figures believe that if France can come forward to mediate and seek a peaceful solution to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, then its task, although not easy to accomplish, is also in line with the times and welcomed by Britain.

<p>(Rome) Lieutenant General Badoglio, Senior Commissioner and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force of Italian East Africa, recently issued Public Bulletin No. 200, stating that the troops under the command of General Nasir Pu, Commander-in-Chief of the Abyssinian Southern Route Army, were defeated by our country at the town of Sasabana and are now fleeing towards the city of Qiqihaga. In this battle, the Abyssinian army suffered a total of 5,000 casualties. Since launching the offensive on the 14th of last month, the Italian army has suffered only 50 officer casualties and 1,800 soldier casualties. As for the northern route, a column of Italian troops, after occupying the city of Makefote, recently crossed the Gabala Rapids and is now no more than 100 kilometers away from the Abyssinian capital. Other troops have also advanced from Teburada Po, the capital of the Begmedet Province, and have occupied the cities of Teburashina and Terma Ba Mountain Pass. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to today's public announcement from the Italian Commander-in-Chief, Italian troops are continuing to advance according to the planned strategy. The Abyssinian army on the southern front is currently in collapse. Italian troops are temporarily concentrated in the already occupied positions in order to continue the advance. Many chiefs of Upper Wokaden have now surrendered to the Italian army and are willing to cooperate with the Italian army to eliminate the Abyssinian army. After receiving the report of the Emperor's flight, British Foreign Secretary Eden immediately went to the Foreign Office to consider the overall situation. Since the League of Nations has not invited the Emperor to attend the League of Nations meeting to be held in Geneva on May 11, and the rumor that the Emperor will come to England has not been confirmed, it is not yet known whether the Abyssinian cabinet members have also left the capital with the Emperor. It is also impossible to determine what impact the Emperor's flight will have on the situation in the Abyssinian capital. It is not known whether the Italian troops will ask foreign residents, including the British Minister, to leave the country when they arrive in the Abyssinian capital. It is reported that the British Minister, Barton, has not yet made a decision to leave the city. The Abyssinian Embassy in England stated that it has not received news of the Emperor's departure from the capital. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

According to General Koni Falov, an advisor to General Gasa, rebels in Malaga fired at the Emperor and his entourage, killing a servant standing next to the Emperor and a guard officer.

At the same time, Abyssinian men residing in French Djibouti have been ordered to report for military service in the Abyssinian capital. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

Among them, exports to Switzerland accounted for 5,813,800 gold yuan, an increase of 4,135,200 gold yuan compared to last year. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Washington) The House of Representatives has passed the naval budget bill, with a total amount of 531,068,707 dollars, which is the largest naval budget in peacetime. The House of Representatives also authorized the government to immediately begin construction of two battleships to match the other signatory countries of the Anglo-French-American naval treaty when they build battleships to replace old ships. The intended uses for the funds stipulated in this budget bill are as follows: To complete the 84 warships currently under construction; To add 12 destroyers and 6 submarines; To strengthen naval aviation capabilities; Raw materials needed by the navy in wartime should be stockpiled in a timely manner. (1st Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee reported the naval budget bill today, it suddenly and unexpectedly considered the bill and will try to pass it by the end of this week. House Majority Leader Bankhead declared that new developments had occurred, so it was necessary to consider the bill immediately. The House will convene a special meeting on Saturday of this week to discuss the bill. The Appropriations Committee's report approved a peacetime naval budget of 531,068,707 dollars to build 12 destroyers, 6 submarines, 2 battleships, and 330 aircraft, and stipulated that the naval personnel be increased from 88,000 to 96,500, and the Marine Corps be increased from 16,000 to 17,000. The provision to build two battleships will only take effect when the signatory countries of the 1930 or 1936 London Agreement engage in the construction of battleships. The Committee stated in its report that the United States should be one of the last countries to participate in the arms race, but if other countries initiate a naval construction competition, the United States will definitely not be left behind. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Appropriations Subcommittee previously held a closed-door meeting to discuss the unprecedented naval appropriations bill. Rear Admiral Taussig of the Navy made an important statement, outlining the reasons why the bill must be passed. The statement was not released until today. According to reports, Taussig participated in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. He stated that Japan is currently implementing a program of large-scale naval and air force expansion and is modernizing its existing battleships and light cruisers. Japan's naval power in the East is increasing day by day. The United States, due to the independence of the Philippines, has fewer interests in the East than before, and the British naval position overseas is also weaker. In light of this situation, the Dutch government is greatly concerned about the security of the Dutch East Indies. Taussig also said that the U.S. fleet will mostly be stationed in the Pacific in the next 12 months and will conduct large-scale exercises there every year. (30th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) It is learned today that Germany and "Manchukuo" have concluded a new commercial agreement stipulating that "Manchukuo" may, within twelve months from June 1st of this year, transport products worth 100 million Japanese yen into Germany. Germany will pay three-quarters of the value of these goods in foreign currency (Japanese yen), and the remaining quarter in Marks. "Manchukuo" agrees to use these Marks to pay for German products imported into "Manchukuo." If Germany's exchange position cannot enable the Foreign Exchange Office to raise 75 million Japanese yen in foreign currency, the products "Manchukuo" exports to Germany may be reduced, but limited to 65 million Japanese yen, and no lower. Payment will still be made according to the aforementioned method. According to some provisions, Japan's trade surplus with Germany can be offset in part by the increased exports from "Manchukuo" to Germany. If this commercial agreement needs to be continued, negotiations should begin before April 1, 1937. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Representatives of the German Foreign Exchange Administration and corresponding agencies on the "Manchukuo" side today signed a German-"Manchukuo" commercial agreement to facilitate the expansion of trade between the two parties.

<p>(Berlin) Regarding the German-Manchukuo commercial contract signed by the German economic survey mission, Berlin government officials declared that anyone who claims this purely commercial agreement has any political implications is trying to create ill will towards Germany. Germany is the largest customer for Manchurian soybeans and naturally wants to import more German goods into Manchuria in exchange for the lowest possible price for soybeans, hoping to meet the needs of the entire country. Germany lacked fat and butter last winter, mainly due to the shortage of soybeans, and the purpose of this agreement is nothing more than to improve this situation. (2nd National Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Internal Ministry Implements Trial Staff Greeting Rituals <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of the Interior, in view of the declining social customs in recent years and the lack of etiquette, which has been ridiculed by foreigners, believes that not only the general public, but also staff in various agencies pay little attention to etiquette. Often, staff members in the same department are indifferent to each other when they meet. In order to correct this bad habit, the Ministry has formulated staff greeting rituals and will first implement them internally on the 1st to see the effectiveness before promoting them to other agencies and the whole country. The draft of the greeting rituals stipulates that lower-level staff must bow to the Minister and senior staff when they meet and take their leave. The Minister and senior staff must also return the greeting. After the greeting, they must also greet each other, with phrases such as "How are you (or How do you do)?", and responses such as "Fine," "Very well." When male and female staff meet, if they shake hands, the female staff should extend her hand first. The etiquette during memorial weeks and other gatherings stipulates that all staff should stand up and salute when the Minister enters the room. When someone is troubled, they must express "Thank you," "Many thanks," etc. to the other party. If there is any abruptness, they must express "Sorry," "Excuse me," etc. to the other party.

<h3 id="e30">Constitution Draft Approved, Legislative Yuan Discussion Situation <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 59th meeting on the 1st, morning and afternoon, and passed the third reading of the draft constitution amendment, with a total of eight chapters and 148 articles, which will be submitted to the Central National Government tonight for announcement as scheduled on May 5th. 68 legislators attended the meeting on the 1st. President Sun Ke and Ye Chucang arrived at the Yuan at around 7:00, but did not attend. At the start of the meeting, Fu Bingchang first reported on the review process, which lasted one and a half hours. Then the second reading began. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 were all passed without objection. Article 44 of Chapter 4, originally "When the state encounters an emergency or a major economic change, and rapid action is required, the President may, after deliberation by the Executive Yuan, issue an emergency order to take necessary measures. The preceding item that must be decided by the Legislative Yuan shall be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for ratification within two months after the order is issued." Lü Zhiyi believed that the term "situation" was too abstract and easily misleading. After the members expressed their opinions successively, the amendment was passed. Regarding the period for submitting to the Legislative Yuan, some advocated changing three months to one month, but it was ultimately believed that the essence of this provision was to comply with the procedures for requesting ratification, and not the length of time, so it was not changed. The original Article 45 of the Five-Yuan Presidents' Conference stipulated that "The President may convene a conference of the presidents of the five yuan to decide on the following matters: 1. Matters that cannot be resolved between yuan. 2. Matters submitted by the President that relate to two or more yuan." Shi Shangkuan, Fu Bingchang, Wu Jingxiong, Xu Yuangao, Zhong Tianxin, Chen Changheng, and others all expressed their opinions. The chairman declared a 15-minute recess due to the complexity of the issue, and an eight-member committee reported on the sorted issues. After continued discussion, there was still debate, with some saying that the Five-Yuan Conference violated the legacy of the five-power independence. However, after Fu Bingchang explained that this was not a permanent institution and was only to resolve disputes between two or more yuan, it was deemed not to violate the legacy. Then the chairman explained in detail and advocated not using a conference to resolve disputes, but adopting the method of the British Prime Minister inviting cabinet members to a meeting. The amendment was passed. There were objections to Article 58 regarding the concurrent positions of the President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan, but it was not passed. In Article 67, Chen Changheng and Guan Suran proposed increasing the number of members from Mongolia, Tibet, and Overseas Chinese from six to eight, and in Article 87, Liang Hancao advocated that the power to discipline civil servants be transferred to the jurisdiction of the Control Yuan for further study, but because there were few supporters, it was not passed. After the discussion of Chapter 4 was completed, the meeting was extended to 2:30 PM to continue the discussion. Articles 109 and 128 were each amended by only one word. Article 130 originally had "However, usage fees collected for the passage of boats and vehicles due to the improvement of land and water roads are not subject to this restriction." Zheng Hongnian was afraid of abuses and advocated deleting it. The chairman agreed with the common opinion, so it was agreed to delete it. Article 131, "Education funds that are independent according to law shall be protected by a team." Chen Changheng and Liu Zhendong advocated deleting it because education funds should be planned as a whole, but there were few supporters, so it was not modified. Article 140, "Laws that conflict with the constitution are invalid. In the preceding situation, the Control Yuan shall, within six months after the law is implemented, submit a clear explanation to the Judicial Yuan, which shall be detailed in the law." Some advocated deleting the second item, and some advocated deleting it completely. After the chairman explained, they agreed to retain it, but the four words "in the preceding situation" were modified. Article 143, regarding the creation of legislators and supervisors during the transition period, half of them are appointed by the President upon the recommendation of the President of the Yuan, but legislators have the restriction of "selecting those with specialized knowledge and experience," while supervisors do not. After debate, the restriction on legislators was deleted. After that, there were no objections to each article. After the second reading was completed, Zhong Tianxin raised awareness of how to remedy the situation when the President is vacant, because there are no such provisions in Articles 51 and 53. It was then passed to add the first item "When the President is vacant, the Vice President shall succeed to his office" in Article 51. The amended articles were then given a third reading, and the remaining third reading procedures were omitted, and it was unanimously passed at 4:45 PM. Then, the National Assembly Representative Election Law was discussed, but it was not fully reviewed. It was decided to continue the discussion on the morning of the 2nd.

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government issued an order on the 2nd stating that the martyr Liu Guxiang followed the Premier in his early years and worked hard for the revolution, secretly plotting uprisings in the two provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi, experiencing all kinds of dangers. He made outstanding contributions to the restoration of Guangzhou in the Xinhai Revolution. Later, Yuan Shikai's dictatorship raised the banner in Liuzhou and launched an army to denounce him. Unfortunately, his aspirations were not fulfilled and he was brutally murdered. His wife, Mrs. Ma, and his daughter-in-law, Mrs. Yang, resisted and died at the same time. Their family's righteousness is worthy of admiration and should be praised by a clear order to highlight their loyalty and inspire future generations. This order also praises Gao Fengwu, who was outstanding in his aspirations and actions and loyal to the party and the country. During the Wuchang Uprising in Xinhai, he joined comrades in Baishui and responded by raising the flag. Then, he fought in Long and Jin, experiencing all kinds of hardships. After the restoration, he served as the commander-in-chief of the Northwest Protectorate Army and the commander of the 5th Route Army of the Shaanxi National Salvation Army, making outstanding achievements. In recent years, he retired to the countryside, living a simple and self-sufficient life.

<p>Kunming (Delayed Dispatch) British Consul in Yunnan, Harding, is of a violent nature and has committed many acts of violence in Yunnan. On April 25th, he again violently assaulted the Boy Scout instructors of a school and the American Boy Scout instructor, Fan Mide, causing serious injuries. It is reported that the Boy Scouts of the Provincial Dingxin Junior Commercial School, after practicing outside the North Gate on that day, wanted to take the opportunity to visit the so-called British Garden. They stopped the team in front of the gate and asked the gatekeeper to inform the consulate. The American instructor, Fan Mide, and instructors Yang Pinjin and Ma Yunxuan, waited in front of the gate to negotiate. Consul Harding happened to be in the garden, and upon hearing the news, brought two hunting dogs. Fan, Yang, Ma and others stepped forward to explain, but Harding, with a fierce demeanor, indiscriminately beat them with his cane and shouted abuse. His hunting dogs also eagerly tried to bite them. Fan suffered three serious injuries, Yang suffered a serious injury to his right elbow, rendering it immobile, and Ma also suffered several injuries. When Harding was committing the assault, Fan, Yang, and Ma were greatly surprised by the sudden attack and did not fight back, fearing that the hunting dogs would run out and bite the children. They also dared not retreat immediately. They then went to the police station to report the incident and to the hospital to verify the injuries. When the instructors were beaten, the Boy Scouts in the team were extremely angry and wanted to step forward to fight, but the instructors, considering the overall situation, did their best to stop them, and fortunately, nothing happened. Afterwards, the Boy Scouts marched to the Diplomatic Office to petition and reported the matter to the Education Department, the Party Headquarters, and the Public Security Bureau, requesting serious negotiations and legal resolution. It is reported that the Education Department has reported the matter to the Provincial Government, and people from all walks of life are rising up to support them.

<h3 id="e42">Prince De Telegraphed Beiping to Deny Inner Mongolia Independence; However, a Certain Country's Plot for Mongolia Is Very Urgent; Mongols Resent Jun Sheng's Murder <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch The rumors of Inner Mongolia's independence have been repeatedly proven false. However, on the 28th of last month, it was rumored again in Beiping that Prince De would organize an Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, appointing himself as chairman, with six ministries established, and the ministers were also decided. Currently, all the ministers are in Prince De's Mansion, (Pangling) discussing everything, and they can be announced at an appropriate time. Each ministry will have two or three departments, and each department will have three sections. The selected ministers for the six ministries are: Yu Shan Jue Lang, Minister of General Affairs; Hori Ming, Minister of Military Affairs; Murata Matsu, Minister of Finance; Hiroshima Shiro, Minister of Education; Ari Saburo, Minister of Transportation (all Japanese); and Baolada Dalifu (Mongol), Minister of Justice.</p>
<p>After the above news was released, it attracted great attention from all parties. Bao Yueqing, director of the Mongolian Political Council's office in Beiping, and Ao Yunzhang, acting secretary-general of the council in Beiping, telegraphed Prince De's Mansion in Bailingmiao on the 29th to inquire about the truth. At 8:30 a.m. on the 30th, they received Prince De's telegram reply, stating that the rumors were absolutely untrue. Thus, the cloud of uncertainty disappeared. However, a certain party's plot for Mongolia is not a recent development. They have indeed sent more than 20 advisors, sitting in Prince De's Mansion in Pangling, urging Prince De. Prince De is currently in his mansion, feeling deeply trapped due to the adverse environment. Although his will is firm, the environment is very difficult. Since Eastern Mongolia was occupied, the people of Inner Mongolia have disapproved of the Japanese actions. Even the recently murdered Mongolian Jun Sheng, former governor of the puppet Beixingan Province, was from a prominent Mongolian family with great wealth. He had been in the Northeast for many years. The charge for his murder was collusion with the enemy (Soviet Russia). In reality, Jun Sheng had always disapproved of the Japanese atrocities and did not collude with Russia. His murder aroused resentment among other Mongolians. At the same time, the Xilinguole League in Western Mongolia (headed by Prince De) borders Outer Mongolia. A certain party fears that Prince De will therefore become closer to Russia, so they are pressing him even harder. Judging from this, the future of Western Mongolia is not optimistic. (1st Day)</p>

<p>Beiping Dispatch The diplomatic negotiations between Hebei and Chahar are still being discussed in Tianjin. It was rumored that an anti-communist agreement had been signed, and it was even said that it contained three articles and two appendices. However, this has been confirmed as untrue. It is now being rumored that an anti-communist committee will be organized, with members from both China and Japan participating to discuss everything. The Japanese side fundamentally denies this claim. This reporter visited Imajo Takeo, military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, this afternoon (1st) to inquire about everything. Here is a record of his conversation: "Responsible persons from both China and Japan held a meeting last week in Tianjin to discuss diplomatic issues, but it was only a friendly exchange of opinions, without any content. The issue of the abolition of the 'East Hebei Government' can only be discussed after the Hebei-Chahar Political Council has made considerable achievements. I don't see any necessity for that. Mayor Xiao (Zhenying) made a statement last week regarding this matter, I don't know what it was based on. I am not aware of the issue of increasing the number of Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin. The claims of increasing the number to 7,000 or 10,000 are only seen in the newspapers. However, I received information this afternoon that a decision has been made to replace the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin. The successor is Lieutenant General Kaneichi Tashiro. The current commander, Shun Tada, will be transferred to commander of the 1st Division. The exact date of the handover is not yet known to me, as I have not seen the official order. Regarding the anti-communist issue, the discussions in Tianjin are only based on the principle of mutual friendship between Chinese and Japanese personnel, and there is no question of signing an anti-communist agreement. I am not aware of the reports that the Japanese side will provide material assistance to the Chinese side on the anti-communist issue. Attaché Takayoshi Matsumuro is scheduled to return to Beiping from Tianjin on the 3rd. I have no information as to whether Military Attaché Kita will come north. I will not be going to Tianjin for the time being. The claim that the Japanese Embassy will purchase the Austrian Embassy is not true," etc. (1st Day)</p>
<h3 id="e44">Tianjin Smuggled Goods Piling Up; Sales Obstructed, Prices Plunge; Ross Visits Tianjin to Meet Kawagoe <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch The authorities have not yet formally promulgated new measures to prevent smuggling in North China due to various concerns. However, since the return of Customs Superintendent Lin Shize from Nanjing to Tianjin, he has consulted with Tianjin Customs Commissioner Xu Liya and the authorities of the Beining and Jinpu Railways, and has begun to implement effective first-step measures based on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance. These measures began on April 27th, with the establishment of tax checkpoints in Cang County (Jinpu Railway) and Changxindian (Pinghan Railway), and inspection stations at the Xiaozhakou confluence of the North and South Grand Canal and Ziya River in the suburbs of Tianjin. Both land and water routes are strictly controlled to prevent smuggled goods from being transshipped from Tianjin to the south. In addition, more than 100 informants have been hired at high salaries to spread throughout the city and outside, and they immediately secretly notify the customs of any smuggling, and the customs quickly intercept the goods. The 29th Army, the Hebei Provincial Fifth River Water Police Bureau, and the police are all assisting in this effort. If the ronin resist, they are forcibly executed. Therefore, although the number of smuggled goods coming from East Hebei in recent days has not decreased compared to the past, it is true that the smuggling of these goods from Tianjin to the inland is no longer as rampant as before. Furthermore, according to investigations, the inventory of smuggled rayon currently stored in Tianjin is as high as 800,000 bundles or more. Due to the obstruction of sales, the original prices have fallen steadily. Tianqiao brand is only selling for 87 yuan, Tantan brand is only selling for 92 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are only selling for 80 yuan, which is a drop of 60 to 70 yuan per piece compared to a month ago. A bag of sugar is now selling for only 16.5 yuan, which is a drop of 5 to 6 yuan compared to before. These are the local prices after smuggling into Tianjin. As for those transported to Zhoucun in Shandong, Gaoyang in Hebei, and along the Pinghan and Jinpu Railways, rayon sells for 180 yuan per bundle and a bag of sugar sells for 19.5 yuan. After deducting transportation costs, the profit is very little. If smuggling is carried out secretly, there is still some profit to be made. However, customs enforcement is now strict, and it is not easy to transship goods secretly. If regular taxes are paid and goods are transported, more goods will be transported due to the lower tariffs. As a result, each sales location will inevitably be overloaded, and those in the business will have to lower prices to sell off, and will eventually engage in mutual squeezing and end up with no profit. Therefore, they are deeply concerned that lower tariffs will affect the future of smuggling. The smuggling ronin have recently been unable to profit from smuggling. The stockpiled goods have also caused losses of capital and interest. In the past week, the total losses are estimated to be more than 100,000 yuan. In order to quickly clear out their smuggled goods, the ronin have sent people to southern Hebei, western Shandong, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai to solicit business from shops in those areas. Therefore, since last week, some smuggled goods have been transported from Tangshan through land to Chahar and then sold to the Northwest. It is expected that in the near future, the Northwest provinces will also become the end market for smuggled goods.</p>
<p>The situation of smuggling in North China is as described above. It has been learned that the British economic expert Sir Frederick Leith-Ross has come to Tianjin again to interview various parties about this matter. Sir Frederick arrived in Tianjin on the 26th. After arriving in Tianjin, he refused to meet guests. According to the British consulate, his visit was a private action and he would not visit any parties. He left for Beijing on the 28th. However, according to investigations, the meaning of Sir Frederick's trip to the north is entirely to investigate the quiet situation of smuggling in North China and the current situation of British commercial economy. On the 27th, he convened British merchants and tycoons to inquire about everything. In the afternoon, he visited the Customs Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, Xu Liya, for a long talk. Before leaving Tianjin on the 28th, he visited the Japanese Consul General's residence in the British Concession at 9:00 a.m. and asked Japanese Consul General Kawagoe about smuggling in North China. Sir Frederick said that too many smuggled goods were being transported, the North China economic market was chaotic, and Japanese goods were monopolizing the market. The British merchants were losing their market. Japan had the intention of directly threatening British economic power in China. Kawagoe said that the rampant smuggling was due to the inevitably high Chinese tariffs. If, as in South China, Japanese goods were given preferential treatment, this would not happen. Sir Frederick said that China's tariff rates were recently planning to reduce. He had made some suggestions, which would be adopted by the Chinese government. Kawagoe said that this was a matter for the Chinese government and he had no right to interfere. Sir Frederick finally hoped that Kawagoe would pay attention to anti-smuggling and prevent changes in British commerce. Kawagoe pointed out that this matter was within the purview of the Tianjin Customs, and the Japanese side could not interfere. Sir Frederick further pointed out that Japan was obstructing the execution of the central government's policies by the Hebei-Chahar political authorities and had unified the currency system in China. He asked if there was any intention of doing this. Kawagoe replied that so far, he had not heard of any such facts. After the meeting, Sir Frederick visited the Japanese Commander Tada, and also exchanged opinions on the previous matter, but still did not obtain any key information, so he hurriedly went to Beiping. Recently, because the wind of smuggling has not been suppressed, British and American businesses have suffered greatly. If this continues, it is impossible to do anything. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross will soon return to Shanghai, or make suggestions to our government.</p>
<p>Last year, the total customs revenue in North China was 40 million yuan. The 24th year is about to end, and although there are no detailed statistics on tax revenue, it is predicted that it will be less than last year. The reasons for this include rural bankruptcy, a sharp decline in imported goods, and the low gold price in the first half of the year, which affected the customs gold unit. The most important reason is the excessive number of smuggled goods. Because of the reduced customs revenue, the guarantee for foreign debt will undergo drastic changes. Tianjin Customs Commissioner Xu Liya will probably go to Shanghai recently to contact Customs Director-General Frederick Maze. (30th Day)</p>
<h3 id="e45">Smuggled Goods Invade Shandong; Rayon Floods Zhoucun; Weavers Greatly Affected <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch Smuggled goods from North China have gradually invaded southern Shandong Province. Zhoucun, east of Jinan, used to be the center of the silk weaving industry, with numerous weaving houses, and was known as Little Hangzhou. After the decline of the silk industry, many rayon goods were woven, and sold far and wide. In recent days, it has been greatly oppressed by smuggled rayon. It is said that these smuggled rayon goods all originate from Yatsushiro and are transshipped through Jinan to Zhoucun, unloading 400 to 500 boxes per day, with each box worth more than 120 yuan. Because they are smuggled goods, they are cheap, and people flock to them. Each day, tens of thousands of yuan flow out. This rayon is worth 4 or 5 yuan per piece in Japan. When transported to Zhoucun, each piece can be sold for 11 or 12 yuan. Because the profit is so great, the smugglers are like madmen. In previous years, the silk weaving business in Zhoucun was relatively stable. Because most of the rayon came from official goods, the cost was slightly higher, so there was no great frenzy in the market. Recently, it is completely smuggled goods, resulting in unstable market prices and daily drops. Each piece has fallen from 17 yuan to 13 yuan. Merchants in this city, because the price of rayon has fallen by more than 80 yuan per box compared to before, believe that it will rise again in the future. Whether they are in the industry or not, they have purchased and stockpiled them. However, smuggled goods are coming in an endless stream. As of April 29th, each piece has fallen to 10 yuan, causing those who stockpiled at 12 or 13 yuan before to lose 50 or 60 yuan per box, and they are constantly complaining. Judging by the trend, it is likely to break through the 10 yuan mark. Because of the falling price of raw materials, the goods woven by each weaving house are piled up like mountains and no one asks about them. The city's finances are gradually drying up and stagnating due to more outflow than inflow. If this continues, the market will be in an unspeakable state. (1st Day)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Shanxi Provincial Bandit Suppression Army Implements Blockade of Remaining Bandits; Bandits Gather Dispersed Troops to Occupy Western Shanxi; National Army Builds Forts for Strict Defense and Decisive Encirclement <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Taiyuan Dispatch The bandit suppression military affairs in Shanxi Province have entered a state of ceasefire in various sectors in recent days. Regarding the bandit suppression strategy, the authorities have recently reached an agreement with the first and second Route Commanders Chen Cheng and Yang Aiyuan after several deliberations, and it seems that some changes have been made. Since the recovery of various counties along the Datong-Puzhou Railway in southern Shanxi, as well as Xingxian and Linxian counties in northern Shanxi, the bandits have suffered heavy losses after repeatedly crossing the river to disrupt Shanxi. With no way out, they have gathered scattered troops and prepared to withdraw their troops and return to their base. Therefore, bandits from various routes have gathered in Yonghe, Daning, Puxian, Fenxi, Xixian, Xiaoyi, and Shuangchi Town in Lingshi along the river in western Shanxi, under the personal command of bandit leaders Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Lin Biao. They are also deploying military forces. On the other hand, puppet political workers are going out to win over people and promote communism, with the intention of occupying the above-mentioned counties as temporary bases and making another attempt to make a comeback. The bandits believe that since entering Shanxi, they have suffered successive defeats, their strength has been weakened, and replenishment is difficult. The initial attempt has not been successful as hoped. Recently, the Shanxi-Suiyuan armies and the Central troops have been advancing steadily, deploying carefully, and the strength is far from what the bandits can match. With no hope of advancing and no way to retreat, the only way for the bandits to return is to their old nest in northern Shaanxi. However, all the river crossings have been blocked by the Shanxi army in advance, and on the west bank of the river, the Shaanxi side has also mobilized a large army to deploy defenses along the river. Zhang Xueliang, Deputy Commander of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, and Yang Hucheng, Director of the Xi'an Pacification, and other senior generals have all personally deployed and supervised the suppression. Therefore, it seems not easy for the bandits to return even if they want to. The bandits are in a dilemma, and therefore have the cunning plan of temporarily occupying western Shanxi to observe the situation. The National Army, in view of this, deeply believes that it is unfortunate that the bandits are disrupting Shanxi, but it is absolutely undesirable to let them return to northern Shaanxi to harm the people of Shaanxi. The fundamental solution is to cut off the fuel under the cauldron and eliminate them all. However, although the bandits are a rabble, they are not enough to accomplish anything, but there are many party members, and if they want to eliminate them all in one fell swoop, they must adopt other effective methods. Therefore, the current changed strategy is to use the situation of the bandits occupying western Shanxi to redeploy the National Army in the vicinity, assigning heavy troops to guard the areas near the bandit areas and along the Datong-Puzhou Railway, to be responsible for local guards and searching for scattered bandits. The remaining large armies are all moving to the bandit areas in western Shanxi, taking a heavily surrounded position. At the same time, strongholds are being secretly built in various key passes in the bandit areas to strengthen defenses. Most of the construction and deployment have been completed. Commander Chen Cheng of the Road recently went to Lingshi and summoned senior military officers of the Central Army to meet, which was to personally give instructions on this strategy. After this formation is completed, even if it is not possible to completely eliminate all the bandits immediately, if the bandits want to wander around, commit rape and plunder, it is feared that it will be an impossible delusion. Moreover, the counties in western Shanxi have obstructed transportation, the land is barren, and the people are poor. Even in times of good harvest, the residents work hard all year round, and 90% of them cannot get enough to eat and wear. The state of their impoverished livelihood often makes people gasp when they talk about it with people in those areas. The state of peace is still like this. In recent years, the rural areas of Shanxi Province have generally been in economic panic, and of course the counties in western Shanxi are the worst. Furthermore, this time the communist bandits are disrupting Shanxi, and the above-mentioned counties have once again borne the brunt. After several battles, they have been ravaged by the bandits, and it has become barren and miserable. Most of those with some assets or abilities have long since fled. In this kind of scene that is no longer human, the bandits still want to occupy it as a base, and it can be said that they will not be able to rely on it for long.</p>
<p>The bandits are extremely panicked because the National Army's encirclement has been completed. The 2,000 to 3,000 bandits led by Xu Donghai, who occupied Daimaijiao in Xixian and Shuangchi Town in Lingshi, have fled south under the leadership of Xu. It is estimated that they are eager to jump out of the cage and open up a new path. However, the strength of the bandits has been damaged and their morale has been low. It is feared that their next move will inevitably be a fierce battle with the Shaanxi army on the opposite bank, in an attempt to return to northern Shaanxi. (30th Day)</p>

<p>Hong Pinlan, captain of the First Company of the Thirteenth Battalion of the Jinshan Security Corps, had previously been granted a one-month extension of training due to illness, and had been instructed to comply with an order from the district commander on April 4. However, yesterday, it was suddenly reported that Captain Hong had not recovered from his long illness and should be dismissed. Subsequently, Wang Qiyuan, a standing committee member of the Jinshan County Anti-Smoking Committee, Lu Xiao, district chief of the first district, Zhu Xalu, chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Tang Zhengdong, chairman of the Rescue Grand Alliance, telegraphed the Security Office from Songjiang yesterday to request the retention of Hong.</p>

<p>When the former Wu County Magistrate Wu Qiyun left office in March and handled the handover, more than a dozen local people, including Zhang Yi, sent a letter to the former Wu County Magistrate, asking him to publicly announce the various financial affairs he handled during his term of office, so that the taxpayers of Wu County could understand the situation. However, County Magistrate Wu ignored this and left without saying anything. Therefore, many people, including Pan Jingsheng, jointly presented a petition to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Jiangsu Supervisor's Office, stating that the former County Magistrate Wu had indeed embezzled funds and committed malfeasance, and requested a strict investigation to clean up the officialdom after he left. After receiving the petition, Supervisor Ding sent Zhang Yuguang to Suzhou on a secret investigation the other day. In addition to asking the original petitioners and related parties about everything, he also visited County Magistrate Deng at the county government to inquire about the situation. Because County Magistrate Deng was ordered to go to Nanjing for training, he was received by Secretary Shi, the acting county magistrate. After contacting him, he left. Committee Member Zhang has completed the investigation and returned to the province on the 3rd to report his findings.</p>

<p>Zhu Xiongwu, a former clerical official in the Jiangsu High Court, was reported for falsely claiming to represent the Jiangsu Judicial Reform Association and for making arrogant pronouncements and slanderous remarks against the President of the High Court, Zhu Shusheng. He was arrested and detained by the Wuxi District Court upon order. Later, it was discovered that Zhu was involved in a fraudulent household registration case, implicating former High Court clerk Chen Chaozuan, lawyer's clerk Lu Wenguang, and several legal and lawyer figures in Shanghai and Wuxi. The Wuxi District Procuratorate summoned and questioned them separately. As a result of the investigation, Zhu, Chen, Lu, Wuxi District Court bailiff Xu Dunben, and Chen Chaozuan's wife, Li, were indicted in the same court's criminal division, with the trial scheduled to begin on the 14th of this month. However, Zhu argued that since the accusations against him were made by President Zhu of the High Court, there might be unfairness in the trial. He petitioned the Supreme Court for a ruling to transfer jurisdiction. The Supreme Court's Third Criminal Division has now ruled in favor of the transfer to the Shanghai Special District Local Court for trial. Therefore, all witnesses and involved parties in the case will soon be escorted to Shanghai for adjudication.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Estimated Spring Silkworm Cocoon Production in Wuxi <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxi Silkworm and Silk Testing Center, in conjunction with various guidance stations, has been actively promoting silkworm rearing for this spring season. All silkworm eggs have been collected and distributed to silkworm farmers for rearing. The number of silkworm egg sheets distributed from the silkworm farming demonstration area is 174,209, more than double the amount from last spring and approximately 70% more than the 106,135 sheets distributed in the autumn season. It is expected that farmers' interest in silkworm rearing has increased this year, and the sale of silkworm eggs by merchants has decreased. The total number of silkworm eggs reared this spring, including those sold by merchants, is estimated to be over 300,000 sheets. If the weather is favorable and there are no drastic changes, the yield of fresh cocoons could exceed 100,000 piculs (担), equivalent to 30,000 piculs of dried cocoons. In addition, Zhou Jixian, a technician dispatched by the Silkworm Industry Improvement Association, has completed his inspection in Wuxi and returned to the provincial capital to report. Furthermore, since 1934, the Provincial Silkworm Industry Improvement Association has been implementing a unified control system for silkworm eggs and cocoon trading, which has been effective in reducing consumption and improving quality. Therefore, the association will continue to actively implement this system in 1936. To increase silk production, the promotion of mulberry seedlings is considered urgent. A large number of mulberry seedlings were purchased from Zhejiang Province last year and distributed to farmers for planting at no cost, totaling more than 2 million plants. This year, mulberry seedlings will also be cultivated on barren land within the province to achieve self-sufficiency.</p>

<p>In Xiejiabiao Village, near Xueyanqiao Town, in the eighth district of Wujin County, a farmer named Qin Cannian married a woman named Qin, who was naturally promiscuous. The couple's relationship was poor, and they often argued. On the morning of the 30th, neighbors suddenly heard of Cannian's sudden death, causing great suspicion. However, they were all afraid of Qin's fierce and overbearing nature and did not dare to investigate. Lu Jingzu, the head of the Xin'nan Township, upon hearing the news, went to investigate with the Baojia chief. Qin initially refused them entry, but Township Head Lu and others ignored her and examined the body, discovering a knife wound in the throat, clearly indicating that the promiscuous woman had murdered him before his death. It is unknown whether others were involved in the murder. Township Head Lu immediately ordered Qin to be placed under surveillance. Qin submitted without objection and was escorted to the Eighth District Office in Caoqiao Town. District Chief Xie Yingzheng reported the case to the local court that evening. Today (the 1st), Prosecutor Guan Junjie went to the village to examine the body and investigate the case.</p>

<p>Outline Passed</p>
<p>Outline of measures for the Agricultural Capital Bureau: In order to circulate agricultural funds, adjust agricultural products, and thereby develop rural areas, the government, in conjunction with various banks, is specially establishing the Agricultural Capital Bureau. The Agricultural Capital Bureau will operate with the following types of funds: (A) Fixed capital: 30 million yuan, to be allocated by the government at the beginning of each fiscal year, starting from 1936, with 6 million yuan to be allocated each year for a total of 30 million yuan over five years. (B) Joint investment capital: 30 million yuan, to be paid by the participating banks at the beginning of each fiscal year, starting from 1936, with 6 million yuan to be paid each year for a total of 30 million yuan over five years. (C) Circulating capital: No fixed amount, to be determined by the Agricultural Capital Bureau in consultation with the participating banks at the beginning of each year and as needed. In addition to the above funds, when necessary, the government may order the Agricultural Capital Bureau to issue agricultural bonds, with the government responsible for guaranteeing the principal and interest. The Agricultural Capital Bureau's affairs are divided into two parts: agricultural materials and agricultural products. (A) Agricultural materials: (1) Establish agricultural banks, cooperatives, or peasant pawnshops in various counties and rural areas. Those that are approved by the Agricultural Capital Bureau and deemed to require assistance may be invested in and promoted with 1,000 to 10,000 yuan from the fixed capital, and the bureau will be responsible for supervision and inspection. (2) Mortgage loans for general agricultural products may be made by utilizing fixed, joint investment, and circulating funds separately. (3) Local agricultural banks, cooperatives, or peasant pawnshops may re-mortgage the mortgaged items obtained from loans to the Agricultural Capital Bureau to borrow fixed capital or joint investment capital, and to participating banks to borrow circulating capital. (4) The Agricultural Capital Bureau may, upon decision by the board of directors,酌借 (zhuó jiè, carefully borrow) funds to improve agricultural products. The interest rate on the above loans shall be determined by the board of directors according to local customs and may be adjusted to a certain extent as a reserve fund. In case of losses on loans, the reserve fund may be used to cover the losses first. The above business shall be determined by the board of directors separately, in terms of operating regulations and the order of their implementation. (B) Agricultural products: (1) Disposal of agricultural products in mortgaged items. (2) General purchase and sale of agricultural products. (3) Acting as an agent for the general purchase and sale of agricultural products. (4) Entrusted by the government to act as an agent for the purchase and sale of agricultural products. (5) Operating warehouses and negotiating with various railway bureaus to build warehouses for low-cost rental. The above business shall be operated with fixed capital, in addition to borrowing joint investment capital and circulating capital through mortgage or acceptance methods. The above business shall be determined by the board of directors separately, in terms of operating regulations and the order of their implementation. The Agricultural Capital Bureau is to be established in Nanjing, with ten directors selected by the government and ten directors elected by the participating banks to form a board of directors. The government will appoint one president and two vice presidents from among the directors to manage the bureau's affairs under the direction of the Ministry of Industries. Branches may be established in important locations, and commissioners will be stationed in each county. The organizational regulations for the Agricultural Capital Bureau shall be separately determined by the Ministry of Industries. The regulations regarding the freight rates for agricultural products on state-owned railways and ships and the tax rates for agricultural products at the central and local levels must solicit the opinion of the president of the Agricultural Capital Bureau. In case of disagreement, the president may submit a request to the government to send personnel to adjudicate. The Agricultural Capital Bureau may, according to the output and traffic conditions of agricultural areas in various provinces, be divided into five zones, to be handled in separate years and completed within five years. The profits and losses of the Agricultural Capital Bureau shall be borne by the government. (A) For fixed capital, any surplus at the time of the annual final accounting shall be used to increase its amount, and any losses shall be made up for. (B) The joint investment capital shall bear interest at a rate of 8% per annum, with the Agricultural Capital Bureau guaranteeing the principal and interest. Participating banks, etc., may include it under the statutory agricultural loan item. The Agricultural Capital Bureau shall issue joint investment capital certificates, which may be used as collateral and may be transferred to other financial institutions with the permission of the Agricultural Capital Bureau. If there is a surplus in the Agricultural Capital Bureau's annual final accounting, participating banks that have contributed joint investment capital will be rewarded. (C) Circulating capital shall be recovered at any time according to its terms, duration, and interest rate.</p>

<p>May 1st is International Labor Day. The Shanghai General Labor Union specially convened a commemorative meeting for representatives of various labor unions in the city at the Ningbo Guild Hall's auditorium at 10 AM the day before yesterday.

<p>Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>The meeting began with the presidium leading the attendees in a ritualistic bow. Then, Zhou Xuexiang reported on the establishment process of International Labor Day and the current situation of Chinese workers. Finally, he put forward the hope that the labor movement should change the lives of workers and step up production. Subsequently, Li Mengnan, Zhao Shusheng, Ye Xianggao, and others gave speeches, elaborating on the efforts that labor unions should make on International Labor Day. The meeting ended at 10:30 AM, followed by the shouting of slogans and adjournment.</p>
<p>Swearing-in Ceremony</p>
<p>After the commemorative meeting adjourned, the inauguration ceremony for all executive and supervisory committee members of the fourth session of the General Labor Union continued. After the ritualistic bow, Zhou Xuexiang reported, roughly stating that today, representatives of various labor unions enthusiastically participated in the meeting.

After the swearing-in ceremony, Lu Jingshi, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, roughly stating that today the country's fortunes are precarious. The reason is the aggression of imperialism. The lives of workers are also in great danger due to the depression of the production industry. However, the depression of the production industry is also due to the economic aggression of imperialism. Therefore, if workers want to find a way out, they should work hard to produce and step up the work of saving the country so that the country can get rid of the shackles of imperialism. Only then will workers have a real way out. Yuan Ludeng and others also gave speeches, which were mostly encouraging. The ceremony ended at 11:00 AM.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Goods Aid and Revitalization Association held the drawing of the Fuguoquan Lottery the day before yesterday (the 1st) at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Auditorium. More than 500 people attended, making it a grand occasion. Lay Buddhist Yao from Suzhou also attended to supervise. Lin Jinyu, President of the Shanghai Auditing Bureau of the Control Yuan, personally came to supervise the drawing. A total of 1,717 winning numbers were drawn, with the entire drawing completed at 2 AM, lasting fifteen hours. The first prize, number 06402, was fundraised by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for the lumber industry association. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drawing Order</p>
<p>The drawing was originally scheduled to begin at 10 AM, but was delayed until 11 AM while waiting for Lay Buddhist Yao to arrive. The order was as follows: 1. All attendees stood at attention. 2. Music was played. 3. The attendees paid their highest respects to the Party, National Flag, and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. 4. Sun Yat-sen's last will and testament was respectfully read. 5. The attendees observed a moment of silence. 6. The Chairman of the Committee gave a report. 7. The Committee members gave a report. 8. The Standing Committee member and Director of the Office gave a report. 9. The supervisor gave a speech. 10. Guests gave speeches. 11. Photography. 12. The balls were checked and put in to the drawing machines. 13. The drawing began. 14. The winning numbers were announced. 15. The meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>At 11 AM, after announcing the start of the drawing and performing the ritualistic bow, Chairman Zhu Qinglan of the Committee reported, roughly stating, "Ladies and gentlemen, the association is very honored by your presence to watch the drawing today. The association, supported by Lay Buddhist Yao from Suzhou, who devoted her family fortune to aid the revitalization, established an office on March 8th. To maintain credibility, we have been busy and meticulous, and in these short fifty-odd days, we have made preparations and are holding the drawing on schedule today. However, it was originally scheduled to begin at 10 AM, but it is now later because Lay Buddhist Yao has devoted her family fortune to aid the revitalization, and she has come to Shanghai to participate in this grand opening ceremony. We had to wait for her arrival, which is why the opening is later. In addition, when Ms. Yao made the donation, she stated that the purpose was to revitalize northern Jiangsu by 80,000 yuan, which has now been done. Of the 120,000 yuan of Fuguoquan Lottery proceeds, 80,000 yuan will go to northern Jiangsu, and the remaining 40,000 yuan will be used elsewhere."</p>
<p>Director's Report</p>
<p>Standing Committee member and Director of the Office Cheng Jingsheng then reported, roughly stating, "Today, due to the pressing time for the drawing, I apologize for not being able to report more fully. Please allow me to briefly explain. 1. All 12,000 Fuguoquan Lottery tickets were fully subscribed. 2. We received generous donations of goods from various benefactors, which are generally sufficient. 3. The exhibition of donated items for the public to view, as well as the invitation of evaluation experts to evaluate the prizes and allocate them, are all past events. Now, after the drawing, we will distribute the items. Please claim your prizes according to the winning numbers. Today, we are borrowing the drawing balls from the Central Savings Society to show our prudence. As for the allocation of calligraphy and paintings as prizes, I dare not say that it is appropriate, because some donors were too modest and marked the prices too low, and the association could not increase them on their behalf. Items from those who were generous and those who were modest were placed together, so the allocation of prizes will inevitably be uneven. Also, within the same rank, the order of priority was based on the order in which the items were received, not on whether the top items were fine pieces and the bottom items were inferior pieces. This needs to be stated. Also, the prize list is difficult to compile, and the prize distribution date was originally set for May 4th, but it may not be possible in time and will have to be postponed for a few days, which will be announced in the newspaper at that time."</p>
<p>Supervisor's Speech</p>
<p>The supervisor, Lin Jinyu, Director of the Shanghai Auditing Office of the Control Yuan, stated, "All lottery drawings should pay attention to being solemn, fair, and impartial. For the sake of prudence, the Auditing Office has sent me here personally." Zhang Yipeng from Suzhou then gave a speech. After the speeches, Director Lin inspected the number balls and poured them into three bronze balls, A, B, and C, to start the drawing.</p>
<p>Drawing Proceedings</p>
<p>The Fuguoquan Lottery drawing balls were borrowed from the Central Savings Society, with three bronze balls, A, B, and C. Ball A contained numbers from 100 to 1300, totaling 1200 number balls. Ball B contained numbers from 0 to 90. Ball C contained 12 balls representing the prize ranks. Because the Fuguoquan Lottery had a total of 12,000 tickets, divided into special prizes and regular prizes, with the special prizes divided into 12 ranks and the regular prizes divided into 5 ranks, the prize ranks were drawn first, and then the corresponding numbers were drawn. The first number drawn was for the 12th prize, totaling 802 numbers. The first prize was drawn at 1:30 AM, with the winning number 06402, fundraised by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for the lumber industry association. The remaining winning numbers are listed in today's advertisement, so I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>Supervisory Personnel</p>
<p>The supervisory personnel present that day, in addition to representatives from various agencies and the association's Chairman Zhu Ziqiao and Standing Committee members Cheng Jingsheng and Wang Yiting, included Wang Xiaolai, Lin Jinyu, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, and others. Lay Buddhist Yao also arrived at the venue at 11:00 AM, accompanied by Mrs. Nie Yuntai and others.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Yesterday's Resolution by the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association: Accepting Advice to Resume Cashing Checks; Specific Measures to be Decided at Today's Emergency Meeting; Foreign Merchants in Shanghai Urgently Request Sample Shipments for Trading; Yesterday Evening's Reception to Various Circles to Report on the Progress <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, regarding the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association, after Anhui Province controlled Qihong tea and suspended check cashing, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter advising them not to persist in their obstinacy and to resume cashing checks immediately in order to maintain the livelihood of tea farmers and merchants. The association held a meeting yesterday and expressed its acceptance in principle. However, specific measures must await further emergency meeting at 2:00 PM today to discuss and decide. The association hosted a reception for various circles last night to report on the progress. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jingdezhen Requests Order to Cash Checks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter yesterday from the Jingdezhen Money Exchange Association, which stated: "We are writing to inform you that, according to reports from various firms in our association, tea firms have purchased drafts from various Shanghai tea warehouses to be cashed in Shanghai. These drafts, worth over 100,000 yuan, are now being held for ten days. We have received a telegram from Shanghai stating that all drafts from tea warehouses, regardless of origin, have been suspended, and many drafts that have already been signed and due have been returned. Our industry has been hit hard and is in a state of panic. We have investigated and found that drafts issued by tea warehouses have always been highly reliable, and in past incidents, they have always been cashed. Therefore, our firms have welcomed and accepted them. Now, the sudden suspension of cashing not only makes it difficult for firms to operate, but also creates an emergency in the financial market. At a time of economic exhaustion, we cannot withstand this unexpected blow. We have decided in a full meeting that, in addition to requesting the Jingdezhen Chamber of Commerce to telegraph your association to allow the maintenance of credit, we are specially writing to request you to forward this request to the Tea Merchants' Association to order the tea warehouses to cash the drafts according to the bills in order to maintain credit and stabilize commerce. We await your urgent instructions."</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Request Immediate Sample Shipments for Trading</p>
<p>A letter from Duder Foreign Firm in Shanghai stated: "We are writing to inform you that we have heard that red and green teas from various regions are arriving, and some have already arrived. However, we have not seen any samples sent by the warehouses. We hope you will immediately notify the warehouses to send samples to our firm as soon as possible. Respectfully, to the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association." A letter from the China Tea Company stated: "We are writing to inform you that we have heard that your members have not yet sent out samples. We are not sure why. Last year at this time, new green teas from Huzhou and other places were already on the market for trade. Now, there is silence. Foreign countries are eagerly requesting new goods, and telegrams and letters are urging. The shipment and sale of domestic products should not be delayed. We are writing to request that you inform your member warehouses to send samples for negotiation as soon as possible. Do not delay. Respectfully, to the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association." A letter from the Fushi Foreign Firm in Shanghai stated: "We are writing to inform you that our firm's transactions always abide by the association's regulations. We have recently heard that red and green teas have arrived, but we have not seen samples displayed. Please ask the warehouses to send samples to our firm immediately for trading. Please do not delay. Respectfully, to the Tea Merchants' Association."</p>

<p>"We are writing to inform you that your association previously decided to suspend all outstanding drafts due to the seizure of Qihong tea operations by Anhui Province's control. Our association believes that this matter is related to the tea market and involves finance, so we requested a serious consideration. You kindly postponed it for two days, but ultimately, as the deadline approached, you did not receive a reply from the Anhui Provincial Government and were forced to implement it, which is deeply regrettable. Since then, the Zhide County Chamber of Commerce, the Jingdezhen Money Exchange Association, and others have telegraphed our association, stating that these drafts are essential for the financial turnover in those areas. Once suspended, it would cause financial panic and have a huge impact. They requested that our association advise your association to cash the drafts. We have forwarded these letters to you from time to time, but we have not received a reply. Your association certainly has its own difficulties, but this case is centered on the Red Tea Transportation and Sales Committee, not the tea firms that are being controlled. If you say that the tea firms are persuading the Anhui Provincial Government to change its policy by suspending the checks, then the tea firms and tea warehouses have had decades of friendship. If they can help, they would be happy to do so. We fear that the current situation is similar to your industry. Therefore, our intention is to strive to preserve your business as one thing, and to safeguard the credit of the drafts as another. We believe that you are targeting the wrong object, which is similar to what the ancients called 'venting anger on the wrong person,' and may even lose the sympathy of the domestic tea industry, and even give an excuse to those who advocate large-scale control. Our association shares your concerns, and we dare not fail to offer our loyal and well-intentioned advice. We have also heard that the Anhui Provincial Government has sent personnel to Shanghai to discuss solutions with your industry for the Qihong tea business. We urge you not to miss the opportunity, to immediately resume cashing checks to maintain the inherent credit of the tea industry for decades, and to send personnel to negotiate in order to achieve a turnaround. Do not persist in your obstinacy. Moreover, the point of contention for your industry lies in Qihong tea, but the scope of the suspension extends to green tea. Now, various types of green tea are about to enter the market, and there is an urgent need for funds. It is even more appropriate to resume cashing checks immediately to maintain the livelihood of tea farmers and merchants. As soon as new teas from various regions arrive, you should immediately send samples to avoid missing the market situation. This matter concerns the people's livelihood and the national economy. We hope you will adopt our advice. Respectfully, to the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants' Association."</p>
<p>The Association Resolves to Accept the Principle</p>
<p>The Foreign Tea Merchants' Association held an emergency meeting at the association at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Representatives from fourteen firms, including Zhongxinpu, Zhenhe Deng Yongxiang, Yitai Fan Baosheng, Yuanfengrun Zheng Jianyuan, Gongshengyong Peng Zhiping, Shenyuan Sun Zifu, Rendenyong Ye Yonghui, Shengchangsheng Zai Yintao, Yilong Deng Ruixian, Xietai Ye Shichang, Tongtai Tao Zhensheng, and Xielong Shan Jianming, were present. Chairman Chen Yizhou reported on the letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce advising them to resume cashing checks as usual and the letters from various foreign firms urging them to send new tea samples for trading. After a long discussion, it was resolved to accept the principle of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's advice. However, specific measures must await another emergency meeting at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss and decide. Furthermore, the cashing of term bills for green tea is easier to resolve, while the problem of red tea is that the funds and tea are not in place, so other solutions should be sought. At 3:00 PM, all attending representatives, led by Chen Yizhou, went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss solutions.</p>
<p>Seeking Solutions by Visiting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Upon receiving the reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce advising them to resume cashing checks and resume business, the Foreign Tea Merchants' Association, led by Chen Yizhou, Hong Mengpan, Sun Zifu, and other seventeen representatives, went to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to discuss. Secretary Yan Esheng received them and immediately announced that the association was advising the tea industry to resume cashing checks and resume business because green tea was about to enter the market and the opportunity could not be missed. Moreover, the suspension of cashing had lasted for nearly ten days, and the financial situation in various regions was being affected. If this continued, it would inevitably cause the national economy and the people's livelihood to suffer. He hoped that the tea industry would accept the advice of the Chamber of Commerce and resume cashing checks immediately. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce would continue to telegraph the government to maintain the situation in order to achieve the goal of balancing considerations. The representatives of the tea industry expressed their willingness to accept the Chamber of Commerce's good intentions and to resume cashing checks for the green tea portion as usual. However, for the Qihong tea portion, the funds and tea were not in place, so other solutions should be determined. Yan immediately stated that the tea industry could decide on detailed measures and then report them to the Chamber of Commerce for review.</p>
<p>Hosting a Reception to Report on the Progress</p>
<p>The Foreign Tea Merchants' Association hosted a reception at the New New Restaurant at 7:00 PM yesterday, inviting all executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, including Yu Zuoting, as well as Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, and over a hundred journalists from various newspapers. Chen Yizhou reported that "Tonight, we have prepared a simple feast and respectfully invited the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the press, various public organizations, and Mr. Yu Qiaqing. We are very honored. On behalf of our association's Chairman Hong, I would like to offer a few humble words and sincerely thank you for your kind intentions. In April 1st, the Anhui Provincial Government suddenly established the Qimen Red Tea Transportation and Sales Committee. The main idea was to revive Qihong tea in name, but in reality, it was to seize the business of the tea warehouses. Our association first requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to telegraph the Economic Committee and received a reply stating that the business of the tea warehouses had been taken into consideration and that there was no control over Qihong tea. We telegraphed the Anhui Provincial Government and received a reply stating that there was no control over Qihong tea, that it would not hinder the tea warehouses from lending money, and that there was no need to worry. Therefore, the tea warehouses proceeded to issue over one million yuan in drafts. Because the Anhui Provincial Transportation and Sales Committee was established, in addition to requesting the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward telegrams to higher levels and Anhui Province, we also sent three representatives to Anhui to petition. As a result, transportation was to be done by the government and sales by merchants. We formally submitted a petition, added further entreaties, and appointed He Jefu and others to go to Qi to implement the lending of money to various tea firms. The tea firms unanimously refused, stating that they had already received funds from the tea warehouses and would no longer receive government funds. After persisting for many days, He Jefu and others first used sweet words to induce them, and then used official authority to force the tea firms to receive government funds even though they had already received warehouse funds, and transportation and sales were to be done by the government. Now, they have completely seized the business. The tea firms that had already received drafts from the tea warehouses were induced to have Qi Fu telegraph the Ministry of Industry to welcome the Transportation and Sales Office's lending of money. He Jefu and others, relying on loans from the bank and official power, took over the business of the tea warehouses that had been around for seventy or eighty years. Later, they falsely accused the tea warehouses of using the suspension of cashing as a threat. It is like killing someone and not allowing them to cry out. The cruel deprivation is unscrupulous. We speculate that their intention is to use transportation and sales as a banner. If there is a road and enough vehicles can be prepared, the tea firms would certainly be happy to comply. Why force them to register for official transportation, and not allow transportation without official permission? As for the word 'sales,' how will they sell it? There is no master plan. It is just empty talk for momentary gratification. They declare that Shanghai is the main sales office and London is the branch sales office. The decline of Chinese tea is entirely blamed on the tea warehouses. They have even forgotten the fundamental word 'fundamental.' What is fundamental? It is improving production. Have the proponents ever considered this? It is as if hanging a transportation and sales sign will transfer the tea market and reap all the benefits. Because the commander's price is appropriate, the tea price will inevitably increase, so they disregard everything and seize the opportunity. They falsely accuse the tea warehouses of exploitation in order to satisfy their insatiable desires. The tea warehouses keep accounts, and every entry has a basis. Except for the use of gold, everything else is the amount paid on behalf of others. Gentlemen, uphold justice, send letters and telegrams, and appeal on our behalf. Some take on the role of Lu Lian, while others offer public commentary. The spirit of the late Premier in heaven upholds freedom of business, and there will eventually be a day when justice is served. We hope you will frequently provide guidance, offer advice, and vigorously support us. Conscience is a great help. We and our colleagues will stand up and offer a toast to the health of all of you." The reception ended around 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Unifying Red Tea Transportation and Sales: Objectives: Reducing Costs; Developing Trade; Balancing Production and Sales; Rescuing Rural Areas <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the governments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces decided to unify the transportation and sales of red tea and organized the Anhui-Jiangxi Red Tea Transportation and Sales Committee, the Shanghai foreign tea warehouses have risen up to appeal, and letters and telegrams have been sent in succession, drawing worldwide attention. Minister Kong recently stated that the purpose of unifying the transportation and sales of red tea in the two provinces is to balance production and sales and improve quality. Merchants believe that the government is competing with the people for profit, which is a misunderstanding. However, the tea warehouses have not ceased their disputes due to Minister Kong's remarks. It has recently been heard that Qian Chengxu, representing the National Federation of Industries, has gone to Anhui to negotiate on behalf of the tea warehouses in order to protect their interests. What the truth is, the outside world is unsure. In order to understand the essence of this unified red tea transportation and sales event decided by the two provincial governments, the reporter went to the deputy manager of the Anhui-Jiangxi Red Tea Transportation and Sales Committee's General Transportation and Sales Office, Zeng Yucheng. Mr. Zeng, as a representative of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, personally participated in the measures taken by the two provincial governments. He agreed to inform us of the process by which the two provincial governments handled the unified transportation and sales of red tea, as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiation Process and Transportation and Sales Plan</p>
<p>Regarding the motives and process of the two provincial governments handling the unified transportation and sales of red tea, Mr. Zeng first stated that the gradual decline of red tea trade is an undeniable fact, and it is the government's natural responsibility to take urgent action to save it. In February of this year, the National Economic Commission convened a tea technology discussion meeting, and the Anhui Construction Department proposed unifying the transportation and sales of Qihong tea to facilitate international trade. The proposal was approved at the meeting. The Anhui Provincial Government, based on the principles approved by the meeting, sent personnel to Jiangxi to negotiate and expand the scope of unified transportation and sales. Zhao, Director of the Agricultural Department of the National Economic Commission, Xiao Chunjin, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and He Chongjie, a representative of the Anhui Provincial Government, actively planned and decided on the organization of the Anhui-Jiangxi Red Tea Transportation and Sales Committee and the outline of its business plan. The Anhui-Jiangxi Red Tea Transportation and Sales Committee was formally established in Anqing on April 1st, and Zhao Lianfang, Director of the National Economic Commission, and the directors of the financial and construction departments of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces were appointed as standing committee members. Various important cases were also discussed and decided. Regarding transportation and sales, the highway bureaus of the two provinces fully prepared vehicles to accept tea from merchants at the bus stations in the Qimen and Fuliang production areas, transport them to Xuancheng and Yingtan separately, and transfer them to the Jiangnan Railway and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Shanghai. This would ensure safety and save time. The freight would be slightly lower than the previous method of transporting by Poyang Lake to Jiujiang and then loading onto ships. The Zhide tea boxes would also be loaded onto ships in Anqing, which would be very convenient. Regarding promotion, a general transportation and sales office would be set up in Shanghai, and Chinese and foreign tea masters would be hired to organize a tea quality assessment committee to balance market prices. Tea prices would not be suppressed, and foreign merchants would not be deceived. A branch sales office would also be set up in London to seek direct exports and contact Russia to restore the original market. Regarding loans, there were three items. The first item was that the Anhui Construction Department and the Bank of Communications jointly raised 400,000 yuan, with Anhui accounting for 20% and the Bank of Communications accounting for 80%, to be lent to the tea cooperatives in Qimen. The second item was that the Anhui and Jiangxi provincial governments and the Anhui Local Bank jointly raised 1.4 million yuan, with the local bank accounting for 80%, or 1.12 million yuan, and the remaining 20% being 200,000 yuan from Anhui and 80,000 yuan from Jiangxi. All of this was lent to the tea firms in Qimen, Zhide, and Fuliang counties at a monthly interest rate of 8%, not compound interest, and to be repaid by the end of the year. If the tea had not been sold by then, the deadline could be extended for two months. The third item was that the Tingxi Yumin Bank alone provided a loan of 300,000 yuan to Xiuwu, Tonggu, and Wuling counties, with the same interest rate as Anhui, which was also 8%.</p>
<p>Over One Hundred Tea Firms Registered</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng continued that the registration of tea firms in Qimen, Zhide, and Fuliang counties had been completed. A total of 125 tea firms were registered in Qimen, 76 in Fuliang, and over 40 in Zhide. The total amount of loans issued was over 1.5 million yuan, exceeding the planned amount by over 100,000 yuan. The total number of tea boxes in the three counties was estimated to be over 50,000 boxes, which should be suitable for the market's needs.</p>
<p>Four Steps to Rescue</p>
<p>Regarding the government's purpose of unifying the transportation and sales of red tea, Mr. Zeng solemnly declared that it was definitely not to seek financial income in the name of unified transportation and sales, nor to compete with the people for profit. The government was guaranteeing bank investment and contributing 20%. In the event of any losses to the bank in the future, the government's 20% would be used to cover them first. Therefore, the government was spending a large amount of money to handle unified transportation and sales. The government intends to take four steps to rescue red tea, namely (1) production, (2) manufacturing, (3) transportation, and (4) sales. The issues of production and manufacturing are matters of time. New planting and manufacturing methods are being tested and promoted by the tea improvement center. The issues of transportation and sales are economic and organizational issues. It is beneficial to the future of tea trade for the government to improve transportation and sales with its power. The decline of Chinese red tea in the world market is mainly due to high costs. Improving transportation and sales is aimed at addressing high costs. After unified transportation and sales, costs can definitely be reduced. (1) The interest rate on loans from tea warehouses used to be 1.5% per month. Now, the interest rate on government loans is 8% per month, reducing the interest rate by nearly half. (2) In the past, tea boxes from tea firms were transported through Poyang Lake to Jiujiang and then to Shanghai, which involved many risks. Last year, over 2,000 tea boxes sank in Poyang Lake, and the losses were too great for merchants to bear. Moreover, the freight from Poyang Lake to Jiujiang and then to Shanghai was quite expensive. Now, the government unifies transportation and sales, using a combination of highways and railways, which is both safe and fast, and the freight is also particularly cheap. (3) In the past, tea firms entrusted all sales of tea to tea warehouses, and commissions and other expenses accounted for nearly 15% of the tea's selling price. Now, the government only charges a 2% handling fee for unified transportation and sales, and nothing else. The government believes that after these three improvements, costs can be reduced, and lower costs and favorable exchange rates will make the future of red tea trade more optimistic. The government will take some time to actively work on production and manufacturing, and there is hope for reversing the crisis of red tea.</p>
<p>Regrettable Opposition from Tea Warehouses</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng expressed his regret for the opposition from the local tea warehouses. Mr. Zeng believed that the tea warehouses should not hinder the entire red tea business for the sake of a few private interests. Whether the tea warehouses themselves exist is a matter of time. As times advance, trade becomes more direct. Goods are sold directly from producers to consumers, which benefits both producers and consumers. The transfer of goods by intermediaries cannot be allowed to increase unless absolutely necessary. The more intermediaries there are, the more the cost increases. Reducing the transfer of goods by intermediaries is an indelible theory in economics. The tea warehouses do not understand this and oppose the government's measures in every way, disregarding the position of red tea in international trade, which seems to violate the spirit of the times. After the invention of the streetcar, rickshaw pullers were greatly panicked and suddenly destroyed the streetcars. In reality, the operation of the streetcars will not be stopped by the destruction of the rickshaws, and the work of rickshaw pullers will continue to be needed in other ways and will be able to survive at the same time. The opposition of the tea warehouses to the government's measures is no different from the rickshaw pullers' opposition to the streetcars and ignores that the unified transportation and sales measures are a product of the times. The position of the tea warehouses themselves is the same as that of rickshaw pullers and may not be completely eliminated after unified transportation and sales. Moreover, the government has fully considered the issue of the tea warehouses' debts and the issue of the tea warehouses' unemployment. There are three measures to consider the position of the tea warehouses: To recruit tea warehouse talent as much as possible to assist in the committee's affairs. For the old debts owed by tea merchants to tea warehouses, both parties will be convened after the tea is sold to handle them according to custom. If there are disputes, the two parties will resolve them according to law. For tea firms that have received funds from tea warehouses this year, if the tea warehouses do not want to provide further loans, the committee can review and transfer the loans and interest. For the tea warehouses' sake, they should support the government's measures and contribute their experience and manpower to the government, working together to seek the development of red tea trade. I personally believe that if the tea warehouse gentlemen change their attitude of opposing the government and cooperate with the government, the government will not hesitate to protect the interests of the tea warehouses themselves. If the tea warehouses continue to dispute, the government is bound by public orders and has already done its best to accommodate them.</p>
<p>Detailed Measures Implemented Step by Step</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng concluded that unified transportation and sales is the initial goal of rescuing red tea. The government will further plan detailed measures and implement them step by step to seek direct benefits for farmers in the two provinces. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will rise up to assist, and the improvement of the lives of farmers in the two provinces depends on this.</p>

<p>From April 27th to yesterday (May 2nd) of this month, every day, flat-Shanghai through passenger trains and freight trains arrived with undervalued foreign silk. Two cases were confiscated in Nanxiang, three cases were confiscated in Zhenru, and seventeen cases were confiscated in the North Station. The total value of the undervalued foreign silk was over 30,000 yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Balunsen, the customs commissioner of the customs service, specially sent customs officers to the North Station to load the 50 large bundles of stored undervalued foreign silk back to the customs for sale and confiscation. It is heard that the customs and the railway have established close ties, so the investigation and confiscation work will definitely be more properly carried out in the future.</p>

<p>The Shanghai financial community has jointly formed a silver group to provide loans for the spring cocoon harvest of the 25th year. The fourteen initiating banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, held a meeting a few days ago and decided that the total amount of loans to be provided would be 30 million yuan, and that the interest rate, term, and procedures would be determined. In recent days, representatives from seven banks, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Four-Bank Savings Association, have been drafting the organizational charter and loan procedures. It is scheduled to convene a general meeting on the 10th to discuss and pass them, and then begin setting up an office and start providing loans. It is heard that the financial community in Shanghai generally agrees with the silver group organization, so three banks, including Xinhua, Quangong, and Zhizhong, participated a few days ago. Now, two more banks, Yongyong and Da, and the Fuyuan Money Shop, have requested to participate.</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held its 18th Executive Committee meeting at 4:00 PM on the day before yesterday (the 1st). The attending executive committee members were Yu Zuoting, Ke Ganchen, Xu Jiliao, Pan Xusheng, Ma Jiliang, Ye Yinshan, Xu Guanqun, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Zenan, and Jin Runxiang. The supervisory committee members present were Fang Jiaobo, Pei Yunqing, Chen Ziming, and Luo Qinghua. Chairman Yu Zuoting presided over the meeting, and after formalities, the discussion began on the case of Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing falsely using the chairman's name to investigate the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company. First, Secretary Yan Esheng read the report from the Standing Committee regarding the case, the letter from the Supervisory Committee, and the letter of resignation from Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing due to illness. The attending committee members then expressed their opinions and, after detailed discussion, it was resolved that Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing, due to improper conduct that harmed the reputation and credit of the Chamber of Commerce, should be subjected to dismissal and expulsion in accordance with Articles 17 and 22, Clause 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. This resolution will be submitted to the General Meeting of Members for approval. As for the legal aspects concerning Zheng Chengqing and Zhang Bofang, the Chamber of Commerce shall prosecute them according to law, and the representing lawyer shall be hired by the Standing Committee. Also, the date of the General Meeting of Members was discussed and it was resolved to hold it at 1:00 PM on June 20th. Membership applications will be suspended from May 21st to June 20th, and the period from May 11th to June 10th will be for collecting membership fees, re-electing representatives, and collecting proposals. The meeting adjourned. Attached are the two reports and letters regarding the Zheng case:</p>
<p>Standing Committee Report</p>
<p>On April 17th of this year, the Secretariat of the Chamber of Commerce received a notice from the Chairman, convening a temporary emergency meeting at 2:00 PM that afternoon. All members of the Standing Committee attended. After the meeting began, Chairman Yu reported that Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing had allegedly borrowed the Chairman's name to pretextually investigate, etc., the Shanghai Textile Printing and Dyeing Company, and attached two pieces of evidence, requesting a thorough investigation. After discussion, it was resolved that if this matter were true, it should be handled strictly according to law. However, to be prudent, the Supervisory Committee was requested to thoroughly investigate the facts before further action. After the resolution, it was recorded and a letter was sent to the Supervisory Committee for handling. Later, on April 20th, Zhang Rongchu published an announcement in various newspapers in the city, painfully recounting the causes and consequences of his failure in managing the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company. Another temporary emergency Standing Committee meeting was convened at 2:00 PM that afternoon, attended by all members of the Standing Committee for discussion. It was resolved that since the case had already been referred to the Supervisory Committee for thorough investigation in accordance with the previous resolution, so that it could be handled according to law, the Chamber of Commerce should issue a statement regarding the handling progress and the fact that Zhang Bofang was not a staff member of the Chamber and had not taken any files for investigation. This statement was published in various newspapers in the city on April 21st.</p>
<p>Letter from the Supervisory Committee</p>
<p>Received your confidential letter of the 18th of this month, stating that Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing allegedly borrowed the name of the Chamber to pretextually investigate, requesting a thorough investigation, etc. Approved. A temporary meeting was convened on the 21st of this month, and it was resolved to publicly nominate Committee member Pei Yunqing to investigate and report in detail before making a decision on how to handle the matter. On the 23rd of this month, the investigative report of Committee member Pei Yunqing was received. Further meetings were convened on the 27th and 30th for discussion. It was unanimously agreed that, according to Zheng Chengqing's statement, the report on the investigation of the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company and the summary signed by Chairman Yu were admitted to be forgeries. Regardless of whether he was motivated by patriotism or for the convenience of the investigation, the procedures were all improper, and he could hardly avoid the suspicion of pretext. Although he did not set foot in the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company or contact Zhang Rongchu, after reviewing the statements of Zhang Bofang and Zhang Rongchu, it could be inferred that he had not had any relationship with Zhang Rongchu. However, Zheng's position as an Executive Committee member of the Chamber and the fact of this pretext created doubts from the outside world, which inevitably harmed the reputation of the Chamber. His improper behavior was indeed inexcusable. According to Zhang Bofang's statement, he admitted to sending a letter to Zhang Rongchu and carrying forged documents to the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company. Zhang Rongchu claimed that he was being held hostage and intended to solicit rewards, while Zhang Bofang claimed that he was not involved with others and intended to ingratiate himself. Although the two sides held different views, regardless of the truth of their statements, the fact that he carried forged documents to make a point and had some ulterior motive was obvious and undeniable. Regardless of what he said or whom he claimed to be, he should not have used forged documents as a tool to achieve any purpose. His actions were highly inappropriate and could not be left unaddressed. Zheng Chengqing is an Executive Committee member of the Chamber and should be dealt with in accordance with the Chamber of Commerce Law. Zhang Bofang is not a staff member of the Chamber and should be dealt with in a separate case. It was publicly resolved that Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing should be subject to expulsion and dismissal in accordance with Articles 17 and 22, Clause 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law, to be submitted to the General Meeting of Members for public resolution. The Zhang Bofang portion should be handled separately by the Executive Committee based on the Chamber's investigation report. In addition to the decisions made within the scope of the Supervisory Committee's authority as mentioned above, the Executive Committee should make a public resolution on how to handle other legal matters.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Law Provisions</p>
<p>Article 17 of the Chamber of Commerce Law states, "If a member representative engages in improper conduct that harms the reputation and credit of the Chamber of Commerce, they may be expelled by a resolution of the General Meeting of Members and the member who appointed them shall be notified. A member representative who has been expelled shall not be eligible to serve as a member representative for three years from the date of expulsion." Article 22, Clause 3 of the Chamber of Commerce Law stipulates, "If, in the performance of their duties, they violate laws or regulations, engage in embezzlement and bribery, or engage in other major improper conduct, they shall be dismissed by a resolution of the General Meeting of Members, or dismissed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce or the highest local administrative authority."</p>
<p>Supervisory Committee Meetings</p>
<p>The Supervisory Committee of the Chamber held three temporary meetings regarding this case, all chaired by Committee member Du Yuesheng. The resolutions were as follows: First resolution of the April 21st meeting: It was resolved that this case is of great importance and should be thoroughly investigated and handled according to law. Committee member Pei Yunqing was publicly nominated to investigate and report in detail before making a decision on how to handle the matter. Second resolution of the April 27th meeting: It was resolved that the conduct of Executive Committee member Zheng Chengqing should be handled in accordance with Articles 17 and 22 of the Chamber of Commerce Law. Zhang Bofang is not a staff member of the Chamber and should be handled separately by the Chamber. Committee member Fang Jiaobo was first nominated to draft a response to the Executive Committee, and then a meeting would be held to make a decision. Third resolution of the April 30th meeting: It was resolved to adopt the principle decided at the previous meeting and to pass the draft letter prepared by Committee member Fang Jiaobo, and to reply to the Executive Committee on the same day.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Public Works Bureau of the International Settlement, in accordance with Article 7 of the resolutions passed at the Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers on April 15th of this year, issued short-term bonds denominated in legal tender for 5 million yuan. The issuance of these bonds began at 10:00 AM on May 1st. The annual interest rate is 5.5%, calculated from the date of purchase. The first installment of interest will be paid on December 31st of this year, and thereafter interest will be paid twice a year on June 30th and December 31st. The issuance price is at face value, and the bonds will be redeemed at face value on December 31st, 1946, secured by the Bureau's assets and annual municipal revenue. However, the Bureau's bonds issued in 1925, 1926, and 1927 have priority security rights. The bonds are divided into five denominations: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, and 500 yuan.</p>
<p>According to sources at the Public Works Bureau, since the sale of these bonds began on the morning of May 1st, subscriptions have been extremely enthusiastic and the subscription is already full, leaving those who wished to purchase these bonds with a sense of regret.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Ministry of Transportation Replies to Chamber of Commerce Regarding Request to Lower Pacific Telegraph Rates: Sino-US Rates Are Already Low, Further Reduction Is Difficult to Implement <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Sino-American Trade Association, the China Branch of the International Chamber of Commerce, and the China International Trade Association previously submitted a petition to the Ministry of Transportation of the Executive Yuan to reduce Pacific telegraph rates to facilitate foreign trade. Yesterday, the Ministry of Transportation issued document Dian Zi No. 951, stating: Received your petition. After careful consideration by the Ministry regarding the request to reduce Pacific telegraph rates, the reply is as follows: The requested reduction in Pacific telegraph rates presumably refers to telegrams sent to the Americas. An examination of telegrams sent from Asian countries to the Americas reveals that the charging method is based on the rate to San Francisco as the base rate, with additional onward transmission fees for locations beyond San Francisco in the Americas. The current rate from our country to San Francisco is 3 gold francs and 75 centimes per word (code word rates are charged at 60% of the ordinary telegram rate). Compared to the standard of our country's current international telegraph rates, this is already relatively low. For example, the rate from our country to Java is 3 gold francs and 20 centimes per word, to Honolulu it is 3 gold francs and 47 centimes per word, and to Melbourne, Australia it is 3 gold francs and 62.5 centimes per word. A brief comparison of the distances and rates of the above locations will reveal that the rate to San Francisco is already difficult to reduce further. Your petition states that the rate from Japan to San Francisco is only 2 gold francs and 05 centimes per word, and from Luzon it is only 2 gold francs and 65 centimes per word, indicating that our country's rate is higher than other countries. An investigation reveals that the rate from Japan to San Francisco is 3 gold francs and 05 centimes per word, not 2 gold francs and 05 centimes per word. This rate has been confirmed by a telegram reply from the Tokyo Radio Station to the Ministry's International Radio Station. The rate from Luzon to San Francisco is indeed 2 gold francs and 65 centimes per word. However, the above two locations are closer to San Francisco, so their rates are naturally lower. A comparison of the rates required for sending telegrams from our country to Japan or Luzon with the rates from the above two locations to San Francisco is listed below:</p>
<p>Location | Rate per Word (Gold Francs)</p>
<p>Shanghai - San Francisco | 3.75</p>
<p>Shanghai - Japan | 0.5</p>
<p>Japan - San Francisco | 3.05</p>
<p>Shanghai - Japan - San Francisco | 3.80</p>
<p>Shanghai - Luzon | 1.00</p>
<p>Luzon - San Francisco | 2.65</p>
<p>Shanghai - Luzon - San Francisco | 3.65</p>
<p>The above table shows that the claim in your petition that our country's rate is higher than other countries is actually incorrect. Furthermore, international telegraph rates should be based on gold francs in accordance with the provisions of the International Telecommunications Convention. However, when collecting fees from the public, each country calculates them in terms of its own currency system. In countries that use the gold standard, a relatively stable exchange rate can be determined by comparing the weight of pure gold contained in a gold franc with the weight of pure gold contained in the country's legal currency. In countries that use the silver standard, the above exchange rate must change with the fluctuations of the price of gold, so it must be revised frequently. The reason why our country's international telegraph rate cannot be as stable as Japan's is this. An examination reveals that telegrams currently sent from our country to the Americas are handled by the Ministry's International Radio Station in Shanghai when transmitted by wireless radio, but in San Francisco, they are handled by the American Wireless Radio Transportation Company and the Mackay Company. When transmitted by submarine cable, they are handled by the Great Eastern, Great Northern, or Pacific Submarine Cable Telegraph Offices under the Ministry's jurisdiction in Shanghai, but the above submarine cables are still the property of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies. If rates need to be reduced, the consent of the above companies must be obtained first, which cannot be determined solely by the Ministry. In short, telecommunications is a public utility, and fees should be kept as low as possible within a reasonable range in order to benefit the public. Reducing international rates can promote trade and assist propaganda, and the Ministry is paying close attention. However, because there are many international communication locations, and the rate and method of apportioning fees are extremely complex, any increase or decrease in the rate at any one location can have a huge impact on the Ministry's telecommunications revenue. Therefore, a comprehensive plan must be carefully considered and decided. Sino-US rates are already low according to the current international telegraph charging standards, and the request for a further reduction is temporarily difficult to implement. Please be informed. This reply.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Instructs That Stamps Should Be Affixed to Delivery-for-Inspection Slips <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the affixing of stamps to delivery-for-inspection slips, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, based on the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, replied to a letter from Futai Xiang Silk Store, stating: In response to your letter of the 30th of this month, your firm has a practice of delivering goods for inspection, and a delivery-for-inspection slip is attached when delivering the goods, stating the quantity and price of the goods. You ask whether stamps should be affixed to these delivery-for-inspection slips. Regarding this matter, the Chamber of Commerce received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, document Shui Zi No. 7298, on September 30th of last year, stating that the difference between a delivery-for-inspection slip and a shipping invoice depends on whether the transaction is completed or not. However, whether the goods delivered are sold or whether a portion is returned is not known to any third party other than the store delivering the goods and the customer. Since this delivery-for-inspection slip contains the name, quantity, and value of the goods, and is issued with the goods, it is no different in nature from a shipping invoice and should be affixed with stamps to prevent taking advantage. Since the Ministry of Finance has interpreted it in this way, it is appropriate for your store to affix stamps to the delivery-for-inspection slips. If a certain amount is sold and a certain amount is returned, this can be noted on the delivery-for-inspection slip, and this delivery-for-inspection slip can also serve as an invoice, without having to worry about opening invoices and affixing stamps twice for one shipment. As for those that are returned in full, there is no remedy.</p>
<h3 id="e73">New Liquidator of American Oriental Bank Appointed: Dr. Schlette Succeeds <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, Judge Helmick, Chief Judge of the United States Court for China, appointed lawyer Dr. Schlette as the liquidator of three companies, including the American Oriental Banking Corporation, on Friday, to replace Mr. Hoeff, who passed away in the United States. According to Mr. Schlette's interview with a reporter, he intends to continue collecting debts owed to the American Oriental Banking Corporation by various customers and hopes to continue paying out 10% of the amounts owed to depositors and other creditors of the bank around June 15, 1936. Mr. Schlette's appointment as the American Oriental Banking Corporation liquidator requires a bond of US$60,000 as a symbol of good faith and responsibility. Mr. Schlette also serves as the custodian of the Probst Field Land Company and requires another bond of US$50,000. After taking on this new role, Mr. Schlette announced his assumption of duties and praised the late liquidator, Mr. Hoeff, for his courage and impartiality in handling such a complex and difficult matter. He also stated that he could not yet provide a date for when the American Eastern Banking Corporation will be able to pay out a certain percentage of its debts to various customers, but hoped that it could be announced in the near future. In addition, the assets of the Probst Field Land Company are now of little value, and it is feared that the debts to creditors will be difficult to repay. He intends to make every effort to collect debts owed to the three companies by various customers before the end of 1936, and to continue paying out to creditors in order to conclude the liquidation affairs in early 1937. As for the Probst Field Land Company, it is now being carefully managed by the custodian, striving for frugality. The protection of creditors is better than it was before the company was taken over by the custodian. The interests of creditors depend on the value of Shanghai real estate. It is not yet possible to decide whether the company will be reorganized.</p>

<p>Yue Wengshi, a woman from Ningbo, is 40 years old and makes a living by setting up a food stall at the intersection of East Qiujiang Road. A Cantonese worker named Jin Shi, 30 years old, lives at No. 10 Fuanli, Xiangshan Road, and relies on weaving for a living. Because his income is very small, he always eats two meals a day at Yue Wengshi's food stall. The day before yesterday, Jin Shi had no money, so he pawned his old woolen hat with Mrs. Yue. Yesterday at lunchtime, Jin went to buy food again, totaling 340 wen. At that time, he paid Mrs. Yue 2 jiao of silver. Yue Wengshi said that the two days of meals totaled more than 600 wen, so she returned the woolen hat that was pawned the day before and asked Jin to pay the difference. Unexpectedly, Jin insisted on using the woolen hat to offset the previous day's food costs and then found 14 copper coins. However, Yue Wengshi firmly refused, and the two began to argue. Unexpectedly, Jin pulled out a knife from his sleeve and stabbed her in the shoulder. Blood immediately gushed out, and she cried for help. Nearby police officers arrived, arrested the suspect, and took him to the police station. Yue Wengshi was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e79">The Cihai Dictionary Compiled and Published by the Zhonghua Book Company is Published on a Regular Basis, Ushering in a New Era for Chinese Dictionaries <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Cihai dictionary compiled and published by the Zhonghua Book Company has been released for pre-sale, attracting widespread attention. A reporter specifically visited the relevant individuals at the company to inquire about the dictionary's compilation process and main objectives. With the company's detailed explanation, we present the following introduction. According to them, this book was started in the first year of the Republic of China (1912) as a sequel to the Zhonghua Da Zidian (Great Dictionary of China). Those in charge were Xu Wugao, Shu Xincheng, Shen Gu, and Zhang Xiang. More than a hundred people successively contributed to the writing, and it took twenty years to complete the manuscript, ushering in a new era for Chinese dictionaries. In ancient China, there were no specialized dictionaries. Those that existed were based on semantic relationships, such as the Erya and Guangya, or based on phonetic relationships, such as the Guangyun and Jiyun. The former evolved into encyclopedic works, and the latter evolved into rhyme dictionaries. Generally, they could be used for literary embellishment but not for understanding principles through reading. In recent years, the creation of dictionaries has become convenient for scholars. However, Xu, Shu, and others believed that with the advancement of modern learning and arts, the changes in personnel, and the rapid pace of metabolism, the propagation and evolution of language were also advancing rapidly, changing daily. If they did not innovate and adapt to the times, the usefulness of dictionaries would eventually be exhausted. Therefore, they gathered like-minded individuals to discuss the format and created the Cihai dictionary. The following is a summary of its main points: (A) Word Selection: This book includes both single and compound words, old and new, aiming to serve the needs of the general public. The emergence of new words and the survival of old words are vast and numerous. Old words can be based on previous dictionaries and encyclopedias, but new words are difficult to collect. Extensive reading of new books and newspapers yielded many results at the beginning, but later, the additions were minimal. Sometimes, it was difficult to find even one or two words in an entire day. Moreover, for imported terms, the transliteration of sounds and meanings often overlapped and conflicted. Deciding what to include and exclude required much deliberation. Furthermore, for the same word, new and old interpretations differed, and usage varied. It was necessary to consider both aspects comprehensively. New developments or changes in events, as well as changes or additions to place names, had to be continuously revised and updated. Words that had already been selected for this book were revised or deleted within a few months, and drafts that had been finalized were repeatedly changed within a year. In total, the number of drafts written was more than 300,000. Including revisions and re-editions, it was close to 500,000. In the end, only slightly more than 100,000 entries were retained. The scope of selection can be divided into eight categories: Words commonly found in ancient texts; Important names, objects, and systems in history; New words that are widely circulated; Idioms and allusions commonly used in writing; Important terms used in agriculture, industry, commerce, and other sectors of society; Commonly used ancient and modern place names in writing; The most important famous people and famous works; Terms commonly seen and used in science and the arts. In addition, any needs related to learning and professional pursuits were also considered at all times. (B) Explanation: In this book, specialized sciences are written by experts. The selection and exclusion of entries have their own systems, and the proportion of each specialty is roughly the same. The method of description is also generally the same. Commonly seen daily words that do not belong to the scope of science may seem easy to understand at first glance but are difficult to clarify upon closer inspection, or they may have undergone changes and cannot be traced back to their origins. For these types of entries, it is necessary to search for the origins of events and provide detailed explanations. The meanings of words were explained differently by ancient people according to the context. This book explains old words based on ancient exegesis. However, when multiple theories are compiled into one meaning, efforts are made to integrate and understand them. When there are divergent views but the meaning and purpose are not significantly different, they are summarized into one entry. When necessary, the theories of various scholars are cited to distinguish their similarities and differences. Therefore, the creation and finalization of one entry often involves reviewing dozens of books, and the result is only a definition of a few words or an explanation of a few dozen or hundreds of words. Also, if the same entry contains meanings from both new and old disciplines, it must be comprehensively explained or marked separately, removing redundancies and combining differences before the final draft is obtained. As for those meanings that are indeed different, they are explained in separate sections according to the traces of their meaning changes. The meanings that are used by analogy are distinguished, and the meanings that are marked with pseudonyms are also distinguished. The entries that are related to each other strive for coherence. Therefore, when proofreading a word in this book, related entries are retrieved and reviewed one by one, and problems are solved simultaneously. (C) Citation and Annotation of Chapter Titles: In addition to entries taken from the original books, this book should also include entries from dictionaries and encyclopedias. In the past, the books cited by dictionaries and encyclopedias either only listed the book name or also included the chapter title, which was inconsistent and easily led to errors. We have tried to find the original books based on the book names and chapter titles listed in various books, but often they do not match. The ancient books cited in this book must be checked against the original books, and the chapter titles must be listed in detail to ensure that they can be found immediately and avoid disappointment. The detailed and brief content of related entries complements each other. If only the detailed explanation is in entry A and the explanation is brief in entries B, C, etc., then only the words "see entry A for details" or "refer to entry A" are listed under the explanation or entry to save space. (D) Punctuation: Most ancient Chinese books do not have punctuation, and the difficulty of phrasing and reading them has been debated for hundreds of years without a definitive answer. This book uses new-style punctuation to determine the phrasing. (E) Volume: The volume of this book contains more than 100,000 entries, with a total of 8 million words. Because of the use of new-style punctuation, it is time-consuming for typesetters and difficult to proofread. However, it is much more convenient for readers. The company considers this book to be a rare masterpiece in the recent Chinese publishing industry, so the price is specially reduced, and low-priced pre-sales are offered to promote its popularity. Sample pages are printed and available for inquiries from all sectors.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Case of the Murder of Japanese Soldier Nakayama Hideo: Full Record of Yesterday's Trial and Testimony; Police First Requested the Release of Chen Rongsheng; Prosecution Against Ye Haisheng and Yang Wendao; Ye and Yang Confronted Each Other, Claiming Ignorance of the Reason; Chief Detective Investigating the Cause of the Assassination <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Public Prosecution</p>
<p>Nakayama Hideo, a soldier of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in Shanghai, was shot and killed on Baole An Road on the night of November 9th of last year. The murderer fled the scene, and only a live pistol and a bullet casing were found at the scene of the incident. Only last month, the police of the Public Concession successively arrested three suspects: Yang Wendao, chairman of the Guangdong Tongren Association; Ye Haisheng (nickname: Little Guangdong), a member of the association; and Chen Rongsheng. A book containing a hollowed-out space for a pistol was found in Yang's home. They were sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. Because the case was important, spectators were prohibited, so the reports in the newspapers were brief. Now, the police have formally filed a public prosecution against Yang and Ye.</p>
<p>Public Hearing</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, at 2:00 PM, Criminal Court President Qian Hongye, together with Judges Feng Shide and Xiao Xiexi, formed a collegial panel in the First Court to conduct a public hearing. The ban on publication was also lifted. After 1:00 PM, those who went to observe the hearing came one after another. The municipal government and the municipal Public Security Bureau attached great importance to it. Mayor Wu specially sent Secretary-General Zhang Tingrong, and Public Security Bureau Chief Cai sent Third Section Chief Huang Hua to the court to observe the hearing. The Japanese military headquarters stationed in Shanghai paid particular attention, sending five officers in military uniform with swords and four soldiers, supervised by a senior officer. The officers sat in the ordinary spectator seats, and the soldiers stood beside them. In addition, all Chinese, Western, and Japanese detectives involved in the case were present in court to be questioned. The atmosphere inside the courtroom was quite tense, and the order was very strict. Although it was a public trial, entry and exit still required inspection. Law enforcement officers and detectives were deployed from inside the court to the gate of the courthouse to maintain order. After the three judges took their seats, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru also attended the court to perform his duties. Lawyers Liang and Ru Bao-Yi represented the police in the prosecution. Since the defendants had not retained lawyers, the court appointed lawyers Fan Gang and Zhang Zhirang to defend them. Now, Yang Wendao has hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Wu Baotai, and Ge Zhaoji to appear in court for his defense. President Qian first asked Yang, Chen, and Ye about their ages, hometowns, addresses, and occupations. Then, Lawyer Ru requested that Chen Rongsheng be released, stating that Chen had no criminal evidence in this case and therefore would not be prosecuted. The court ordered that he be released and, for the sake of caution, ordered all witnesses to be interrogated separately. Those who were to be questioned were temporarily asked to step aside to await their summons. Then, Lawyer Ru presented the facts of the crime committed by Yang and Ye.</p>
<p>Prosecution's Intent</p>
<p>Stating that, according to Article 271 of the Criminal Law, the defendants are accused of murder. A Japanese soldier named Nakayama Hideo was shot and killed with a pistol on Baole An Road at 9:00 PM on November 9th of last year. After investigation by the police, it was determined that Yang Wendao fired the shot, and Ye Haisheng was present to help commit the crime. The evidence is as follows: The medical report of the doctor who examined the deceased confirmed that he was killed by a pistol. A pistol was found at the scene of the incident that night. This gun was made in Italy, with the number 14246. Its caliber is .32. It was found by a Japanese patrolman in the Fengle Lane on North Sichuan Road. There were five bullets inside the gun, and another bullet had already been fired into the chamber. At the same time, another Japanese patrolman also found a bullet casing and a bullet that had been fired at the scene. A book was found in Yang Wendao's bedroom at No. 18, Tong'an Lane, Tangshan Road. This book was found by Japanese patrolman No. 134 under the clothes rack. It is called "Practical Physics." There was a hole in the book in the shape of a pistol. When the gun found at the scene was inserted into the hole, it fit perfectly. Moreover, the gun had been stored in the hole for a long time, so the Western license number and texture on the gun were deeply imprinted on the book page. This imprint has been photographed and is easy to examine. After Yang was arrested, he admitted to the court that the book was his, but he said that the book was picked up from outside by his child, and he had borrowed a "Dimeng" (transliteration) brand pistol from his friend Li, and had obtained a gun license from the Public Works Department. The hole in the book was for storing the borrowed gun. After investigation by the police, it was learned that Li's gun had been lent to Xu Xiangxing, so the gun was retrieved from Xu. The gun number was 87958, while the gun license that Yang had donated in previous years was 2617. However, the gun did not fit into the hole in the book, so Yang's statement that the hole in the book was for storing the Dimeng brand pistol and not the "Western Pi" brand pistol was unbelievable. During the second interrogation, Yang's father stated that the book found was not the original book found in his home. Although there was a book that was searched at that time, it was not the book presented now. The previous and subsequent statements contradicted each other, which shows that the defendant had a great relationship with the "Western Pi" brand pistol found at the scene. As for Ye Haisheng, after being arrested, he wrote a confession in the police station, in which he confessed that Yang had discussed the matter with him beforehand, witnessed Yang firing the gun, and then fled separately. If his confession is true, then the murder committed by the two defendants is undoubtedly true. The witness Zeng Yun has a deep understanding of the murder weapon. Now he has been summoned with other witnesses, and they should be investigated one by one, and the two pistols, bullets, bullet casings, and photos and other exhibits should be submitted to the case.</p>
<p>Detectives' Report</p>
<p>Then, the detectives in charge of the case reported the situation of the investigation to the court in order. First, the Japanese deputy head of the Jiaxing Road police station translated. He said that at 11:40 PM on November 9th of last year, he learned of the consumption that Nakayama Hideo was murdered, and he went to Fengle Lane to investigate. He found a pistol near the residence of the Sige people in the lane and brought it back to the police station. At that time, he did not pay attention to whether there were any fingerprints left on the gun. Next, Western Detective Hart of the Dixiwei Road police station translated. He said that he went to the scene of the incident at 9:05 PM on the same night. By the time, the body had been moved away, but blood stains remained on the ground. The place was 29 feet and 6 inches away from Baole An Road, and a little south was where the pistol bullet found in Fengle Lane was more than four feet away from the blood site. The place where the body fell was 13 feet away from the steps along Baole An Road. After Nakayama was shot, he did not die immediately, but died at the Japanese Marine Corps Hospital at 1:00 AM the next morning. All guns and bullets will be proven by firearms experts separately. Then, Western Detective Oak of the Firearms Inspection Department reported the process of inspecting the pistol bullets, translated by interpreter Jiang Baoliang. According to him, after inspecting the four-pi brand pistol on November 10th of last year, he felt that its machinery was complete and it had been used recently. He immediately test-fired it with live ammunition, and the shape of the bullet casing ejected was the same as the shape of the bullet casing handed over for inspection. Therefore, it can be determined that the bullet casing was indeed fired from the gun. He also submitted an enlarged photo of the gun bullet to the case. Then, Western Deputy Detective Haisheng reported on the inspection of the fingerprints, saying that since the gun was steel and the paint had not completely fallen off, it would not leave any fingerprints even if it was held by someone's hand. Then, Japanese patrolman No. 61 and Japanese detective No. 83 of the Dixiwei Road police station separately reported that at about 10:00 PM on November 9th, they found a bullet and a bullet casing that had been fired near the scene of the incident. The bullet was still stained with blood. Then, Japanese patrolman No. 160 proved that he went to Yang Wendao's house at No. 18, Tong'an Lane, Tangshan Road with Chinese and Western detectives at 4:00 PM on April 19th of this year and searched the bottom of the clothes rack in Yang's bedroom for a book. Western Detective Hart then translated, saying that when the Japanese patrolman discovered the book, all the personnel who were searching at the same time had witnessed it, and he took the book from the Japanese patrolman and took it back to the police station during the search. Yang Wendao glanced at it, and immediately admitted that the book was his, and also said that there was a hole in the book for storing a pistol. Later, it was learned that Yang had borrowed a pistol from Li, and then Li lent it to Xu Xiangxing. Now the gun has been retrieved, but the size of the hole in the book is not suitable, which is a subtle indication that the hole was not storing Li's gun.</p>
<p>Ye Haisheng's Confession</p>
<p>The court then questioned the defendant Ye Haisheng, who confessed that he was 28 years old, from Guangdong, and working as a dance hall leader, living at No. 22, Qingdao Cangku Road. He often went to and from Shanghai Qing. This time, he went to Qing to open a dance hall last November. The capital was provided by my wife Chen Guizhen, who used to be a dancer. I met her in the dance hall. Chen once followed Huang Jinrong. I only bonded with her when I went to Qingdao the year before last. She has been a dancer for eight years and has quite a lot of savings. On November 7th of last year, Yang Wendao came to me, but I didn't go to his house. Yang's house is on Tangshan Road, I have been there several times before. I didn't go this time, so Yang came to visit me again at the door of the Moon Palace Hotel on North Sichuan Road at 7:00 PM on the 9th, along with the Korean Jack. I have a gap with Jack and he is violent. I didn't want to see him, so I told Yang. Yang told me not to be afraid of him and said that he was going to kill a Japanese person and invited me to go with him. After only these words, I followed him. When we arrived at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Baole An Road, Yang suddenly went ahead, Jack blocked it, and I was in the rear. When we reached the corner, we saw a Japanese soldier coming towards us, and we saw Yang flipping through the book he was carrying, and then we heard a bang. We scattered and fled. Yang first formed the Hongshun Mutual Aid Association, and he was the chairman. I joined the association in the 22nd year as a member. Later, the Hongshun Association disbanded, and Yang formed the Tongren Association, and still served as chairman. I was also a member. The former members of the association were also members of Hongshun, so we knew each other. At that time, I gambled and defrauded the deposit of his second landlord, and I also opened a Yanzike, and someone reported it to the association, so we fought twice. I have never used a pistol to pledge 25 yuan to him.</p>
<p>Witness Zeng Yuan</p>
<p>The court then summoned the witness Zeng Yuan, who confessed that he lived at No. 6, Fengle Lane, Baole An Road, and worked as a lunch box maker. He used to be a clerk at Taikoo, and he knew Yang Wendao because he worked at the Taikoo warehouse. He knew Ye in the dance hall. Ye's economic situation is not very clear. At the end of September last year, Ye asked for 25 yuan, but I refused because he had no guarantor. Two days later, Ye came again with a pistol to pledge. My wife thought it was dangerous and told me to reject it. I never fought with Ye. Ye heard the words and immediately confronted me, but he denied that he had fought, and insisted that Ye had used a pistol to pledge the deposit without success. He also said that in December, a friend surnamed Chen came to visit, and accidentally flipping through the application for a loan, he caught a glimpse of Ye, so he talked about it. Unexpectedly, Chen told the detectives. In January of this year, detectives came to inquire and I recognized that one of the several pistols was the one Ye had used to borrow money, because there were two circles on the face of the gun, so I could still recognize it. As for Ye's loan application, it has been torn up with other discarded ones. At this time, the defendant's lawyer Wan Zhaoji wanted to state the details of the situation, but it was quite complicated. Then the defendant's lawyer Jiang Yiping requested the court to allow the details that Lawyer Ge wanted to say to be submitted in writing later, so as not to disclose the secret and save time.</p>
<p>Yang Wendao's Confession</p>
<p>The court then questioned the defendant Yang Wendao, who confessed that he was the chairman of the Hongshun and Tongren Associations, and Ye was a member of Hongshun. I used to work at Taikoo, so I knew Zeng Yuan. The book found in my house is not the book presented to the case. The reason why I confessed that the book presented to the case was found in my house during the first trial was because I didn't look closely at the time, and the two books were similar in form. My book also had a hole, which contained a pistol that I borrowed from Li Mu and had a license donated to the Public Works Department. I don't know the number and brand of the gun now. I did not send a letter to Ye Haisheng on November 7th, and I did not invite Ye Haisheng to shoot and kill Japanese soldiers with the Korean at night on the 9th. I don't know why Ye said this now. The court then ordered Ye and Yang to confront each other. Ye repeated the details he had confessed, but Yang still said that this was not the case, but was being falsely accused by him and wanted to shift the blame to me, but I have no feud with Ye. The court then questioned Ye again and instructed him to explain the reason for the murder. Unexpectedly, Ye claimed that he did not know the reason either. At that time, Yang only said that he was going to kill a Japanese person, and then he followed him. He did not meet Yang afterwards.</p>
<p>Zhang Kaiyuan's Confession</p>
<p>The court also summoned the witness Zhang Kaiyuan, a Ningbo native, who confessed that he founded a dance school and hired Ye to teach dance, so he knew him. On the night of November 29th, he saw Ye, the Korean Jack, and another person walking on the road. Not long after, I heard people in the Nanyang Dance Hall say that a Japanese soldier had been shot and killed. At that time, I suspected that Ye and others were responsible. When Jack was detained by the Japanese consulate, I talked about it with people and was heard by the detectives. Now I am being summoned to testify, etc. Ye confronted Zhang, saying that the clothes he was wearing that night were inconsistent. After questioning, the court ordered Western Detective Hart to base his report on the reason for the death of the deceased. He said that he was still investigating, and that his actions that day had been investigated. The deceased was originally full of duties and was planning to return to his country. That afternoon, he first played at No. 33, Yokohama Bridge. A Japanese woman lived in that house. Then he re-entered No. 27. He resigned at about 8:30. Judging from his route, it seemed that he was going back to camp, so he walked slowly along North Sichuan Road to Baole An Road and was killed. It was already five o'clock, and President Qian instructed to reschedule the trial to Wednesday afternoon next week. Yang and Ye were still escorted back to the police station in a prison car by detectives to be detained.</p>

<h3 id="e82">Republic Road Robbery at Rice Store - Box Cannon Injures Western Detective - Police Detectives Bravely Give Chase... Gang Fires Along the Way - Left Bandit Climbs onto Rooftop to Escape... Remaining Bandits and Loot Captured <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Around 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, at the Jin Sheng Chang Rice Store, a three-bay shop located at numbers 46, 48, and 50 near the Xiaocai Market on Gonghe Road in Zhabei, a young apprentice named Cai Deyang, aged nineteen and from Gaoqiao in Pudong, arrived at the store on a bicycle from the old store on Wuchang Road in the concession (Jin Sheng Rice Store) to collect accounts. As he stepped out of the store, preparing to mount his bicycle, a tall bandit wearing a grey cloth long gown and speaking with a Jiangbei accent appeared beside him. The bandit pulled out a box cannon, saying, "Be sensible!" and snatched a package of silver dollar fractional notes, totaling forty-nine dollars and ten cents, from the apprentice's outer pocket. Apparently, the bandit didn't realize they were fractional notes or how much they amounted to, so he fled north along Datong Road and Haichang Road with the loot. Upon entering the crowd, the bandit handed the stolen money and box cannon to another bandit. Store employees who witnessed the event blew a police whistle and gave chase. Police officer Du Yikuan, who was on duty at post number 14, and Ning Zhenlin, from neighboring post number 15, hearing the alarm, pursued the bandits frantically. At the intersection of Datong Road and Haichang Road, one of the bandits, wearing a blue cloth long gown, fired a box cannon at Officer Ning, but luckily missed. The bandits then split up and fled along Haichang Road, firing continuously to resist arrest. At this time, Bao Ziying, the captain of the Xinzha Detective Squad, led team leader Li Shouchang and detectives Lü Qingkang, Liu Tongjie, Sun Youzhi, and Zhang Shuwen in a brave pursuit. The first team of the security forces also assisted in the capture. The bandits crossed bamboo fences into small paths northwards, then fled wildly along the railway towards the Sun Temple. One bandit lost a pair of Zhigong呢shoes while running. The police officers at the Sun Temple post, hearing the whistle, blocked the escape route. Officer Du then grabbed the bandit carrying the stolen money and the shoe, and took him back to the team for interrogation. The bandit confessed to being Wang Renfu, aged twenty-six, from Funing, residing in a straw shack in Caojiadu. He admitted that he and his accomplices Jiang Zhengming and Zuo Zhengzhong had brought a box cannon and robbed the rice store on Gonghe Road of its account money. He stated that the box cannon had been handed to Zuo, and that Zuo and Jiang had fled together, living at number 1, Yuandian Lane, Zhoujiazui Road in the concession, and offered to lead them to their arrest. After the team obtained this confession, in addition to the original officers Liu Tongjie and Lü Qingkang, they dispatched Mao Gongzhao, Liu Bingrong, Yuan Weishu, and Gao Changgui to collaborate with the Jiaxing Road Police Station. At 6:30 PM that day, they sent Western detective Ai'erde Si from the 4th team and Chinese detective Mu Jin Yangwu number 10, and Chinese detective Gu Wenyao from the 157th team to Yuandian Lane number 2, Zhoujiazui Road, for a secret arrest. A woman answered the door. The detectives stopped her immediately. Western detective Ai'erde Si was the first to go upstairs, but the bandit Zuo Zhengzhong had already noticed them and fired a box cannon at the Western detective, injuring his right arm. Zuo then carrying the gun leaped onto the roof to escape. Hearing the sound, the detectives downstairs rushed upstairs, but Zuo had already disappeared. They arrested Jiang Zhengming and the woman, Chen Zhou shi. The injured Western detective was taken to the hospital in an ambulance summoned by the police station. Inside the house, they found the original stolen fractional notes totaling twenty-three dollars and ninety cents, fifteen bullets, one magazine, two seals, fourteen pawn tickets, and sixty fake pearls, all of which were taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief, the case was handed over to the detectives of the Public Security Bureau to be taken back to Zhabei for further investigation. Jiang Zhengming confessed to being thirty-four years old, from Funing, and residing at number 2 Yuandian Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, stating that he was the second landlord, etc. Chen Zhou shi confessed to being thirty-two years old and a hired servant, etc. It is also reported that the gang is suspected of other crimes and is currently under investigation.</p>

<p>Sheng Yuchang, grandson of Sheng Xuanhuai of the Qing Dynasty, residing at number 1, Avenue Petain in the French Concession, was recently sued by Mr. Olerton (British citizen), the legal representative of the New Sassoon Bank on the Bund, represented by lawyer Cai Rudong, at the Second Special Court Civil Division. The suit alleged that Sheng had defaulted on a mortgage loan. The court approved the request. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Li Liang, accompanied by clerk Wang Yihui, presided over the hearing in the seventh civil court. The defendant was absent. The plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Cai, stated that the defendant had mortgaged real estate, including the French land deed and the British land deed, to the plaintiff on September 15th of the 22nd year of the Republic for 270,000 yuan, with a term of two years expiring on September 15th of the 24th year of the Republic, at an annual interest rate of 8%. A contract was signed by both parties and submitted for review. However, the defendant failed to repay the loan upon expiration and stopped paying interest from March 15th of the 24th year of the Republic. The plaintiff also advanced insurance fees of 1,734 yuan and 65 cents. He requested that the court combine the claims and pursue the interest from March 15th of the 24th year of the Republic until the end of the litigation, for full repayment. He also requested permission to provide collateral and declare provisional execution. Furthermore, since the contract was made in silver dollars, it should be converted to legal tender at the current rate. He also requested that the plaintiff be allowed to preserve the terms of the mortgage silver dollars in the contract. The case was previously filed with the First Special Court, but was transferred to this court due to jurisdictional issues. Since the defendant was legally summoned but failed to appear today, he requested permission for a one-sided hearing and a judgment to repay the plaintiff's claim. The court granted permission for a one-sided hearing and scheduled the pronouncement of the judgment for the afternoon of the 6th.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Ningbo Native Association Calls Emergency Meeting Regarding the Relocation of Graves in Ningbo - Public Outrage, Crowded Gallery - Telegrams Sent to Central and Provincial Governments Requesting Rectification <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, concerned about the hasty relocation of graves in various towns and villages in Ningbo, which has led to incidents of graves being mistakenly exhumed, such as the ancestral grave of the former director of the Palace Museum and the grave of the elder brother of Zhao Bonian, the former speaker of the Yin County Assembly, both being relocated by the township governments due to failure to register in time, and numerous similar cases, and furthermore, the contractors responsible for the relocation were using small coffins to hold the remains of four or five bodies, causing dismemberment and desecration, which was too ghastly to bear. At the request of the Ningbo people, the association telegraphed the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Department of Civil Affairs, requesting rectification. They received a reply from the provincial government stating that graves that had been buried for a long time would be exempt from relocation, as previously reported. However, the Yin County Government continued to issue notices urging relocation and did not exclude existing graves, causing great panic among the local people and the Ningbo people in Shanghai, who pleaded for assistance. Considering the urgency of the matter, the association convened an emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday afternoon. The Ningbo people were extremely concerned about this case, and hundreds of them gathered at the association to listen in. The meeting room was overcrowded, and the atmosphere was tense, with the public feeling extremely outraged. The meeting adjourned at over 7 PM. The names of the committee members present, as recorded, include Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Boyuan, Qin Runqing, Jin Runxiang, and over fifty others. It was resolved to send telegrams to the provincial government and Chairman Jiang of the Executive Yuan requesting rectification and to appoint seven committee members to form a special committee to handle the case.</p>

<p>The upcoming World Games are scheduled to be held in Berlin, Germany, from August 1st to 16th of this year. The Chinese delegation, consisting of 100 people, has entrusted China Travel Service with the purchase of tickets, transportation of luggage, and processing of passports and various procedures through the National Sports Association. The decision has been made to depart from Shanghai on the Italian postal ship Conte Verde on June 26th, disembarking in Venice, Italy, and then transferring by train to Germany. After the closing of the World Games, they will return home on the Conte Rosso, departing from Italy on September 9th, arriving in Hong Kong on the 25th of the same month, and arriving in Shanghai on the 27th. Considering that Europeans and Americans often come in groups to visit our country's major cities to learn about our customs and culture and to investigate commercial conditions for reference upon returning home, and that our people rarely undertake such grand tours, the company, based on its commitment to serving travelers, is organizing a tour group to attend the World Games and travel to Europe. The costs will be kept to a minimum, and specialists will be assigned to accompany the group. This will enable those in the country who wish to attend the World Games to travel in groups, to witness the competition of the world's athletes, and to take the opportunity to visit the capitals and scenic areas of European countries, gaining a deep understanding of the ancient and modern culture of those countries. This is truly killing several birds with one stone. The tour is scheduled to depart with the delegation on the same ship and return to Shanghai on the same ship, with a total duration of three months and one day, and 46 days of travel in Europe. In addition to attending the World Games, the tour will visit Venice, Vienna, the capital of the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, London, Brussels, Paris, Geneva, Nice, Monte Carlo, Genoa, Rome, and Naples. As for the ports along the Italian postal route, including Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo, and Little Luzon, it is planned to disembark and travel by car, with the length of time depending on the time the ship docks. According to the above itinerary, the cost includes passage in economy class, accommodation in second-class hotels, train tickets, and entrance tickets to the venues for the World Games and various art galleries and theaters, all limited to second class. Other expenses, such as luggage transportation and local guides, are included. The cost is £155 per person. Those who wish to upgrade to first-class ship and first-class hotels will need to pay £280 per person. Personal expenses, tips on the ship, and passport fees are not included.

<p>Zhang Xiangsheng, a landowner in Nanhui County, acted as a guarantor for the deceased Pu Xiansheng to the county government as a tax collection official. Last year, Pu Xiansheng became ill and owed 1,820 yuan in public funds. The county government then pursued Zhang Xiangsheng for the guaranteed debt, even detaining Zhang. Zhang then applied to the Jiangsu High Court for relief in accordance with the law, first requesting execution against the deceased debtor's estate. The original court designated the Shanghai Local Court to handle the case. A summons was issued, but because the defendant was the Nanhui County government, the proceedings ended with a one-sided argument. The judgment was pronounced yesterday, stating that Zhang Xiangsheng's liability to the Nanhui County government in the debt case, involving the 1,820 yuan in public funds owed by the deceased Pu Xiansheng, is contingent upon the plaintiff's confirmation that the defendant has not forcibly executed against all of Pu Xiansheng's assets without effect. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant.</p>

<p>A woman from Yangzhou surnamed Wang, aged thirty-six, came to Shanghai last winter to work as a servant. She had an affair with Su Hongkai, a fellow villager residing at number 46, Yuanfang Road, and became pregnant. Her abdomen gradually grew larger. She had a grown son and daughter-in-law in her hometown, and she was to return home in August to become a mother-in-law. In desperation, she asked fellow servant women Qian Xie shi and Ma Yu shi to find an elderly woman who performed abortions. Unable to find one, Ma Yu shi knew a woman named Wang Xiaomei, also from Yangzhou and working as a servant for a Cantonese family on Tangshan Road, who had previously handled such abortions without incident. On the 25th of last month, she went to Wang Xiaomei's house and told her the situation. Wang Xiaomei introduced her to Ma Gu shi, an elderly woman from the same village who lived at number 42, Zhejiang Xingli, Disiwei Road in Zhabei, and agreed on a fee of seven yuan. The next day, Ma Gu shi inserted something into Wang's lower body, saying that the fetus would be aborted in 24 hours. The method worked, but Wang suffered severe abdominal pain afterwards. At 4:40 PM on the 27th, she was sent to Guangren Hospital, where she soon died. A telegram was sent to the Huishan police station, which dispatched detective Ma Wenda to transport Wang's body to the morgue on Piren Road. Tang, a prosecutor from the Special First Court, inspected the body and confirmed the death. Qian Xie shi, Ma Yu shi, Su Hongkai, and Wang Xiaomei were successively arrested and detained in the Third Criminal Court. Ma Gu shi is at large. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzhi presided over the continued hearing. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that after investigation, Su Hongkai was found not to be involved and should not be prosecuted.

<p>Huang Heqing, from Ningbo, worked in Shanghai for many years as a translator for foreign lawyers and founded the Mei Hua Bank, accumulating substantial wealth. Later, due to business failures, he fell ill and died. His two sons were named Tongbo and Tonghai. His younger son, Huang Tonghai, previously had a lawsuit with Zhou Qiankang's daughter, the manager of the Shanghai Brewery Company, over marriage disputes in the First Special Court. In February of this year, the elder son, Huang Tongbo, was also sued in the Special First Court by a woman named Ding Xu shi and her daughter Ding Peiyu for violating public morals. The contents of the lawsuit were that Huang Tongbo, now 26 years old, worked in the comprador's office of the Japanese shipping company on the Bund. Ding Peiyu was fifteen years old. When she was seven years old, she was sent to live with Huang Heqing's concubine, Huang Ding shi, calling Huang Ding shi her foster mother. Therefore, she and Tongbo were foster siblings, growing up together. On the afternoon of January 28th of this year, Tongbo went to his stepmother's residence at number 17, Dazhongli, Tongfu Road. Seeing that only Ding Peiyu was there, Tongbo falsely claimed that he was going to the North Station to pick up his mother and took Ding Peiyu in his private car, number 2558, to a remote place on Xiaoshadu Road. He then raped Ding in the car. When Ding's mother, Xu shi, found out, she filed a private prosecution, requesting legal punishment and attached a civil suit, seeking compensation for damages of 27,000 yuan. After the court issued summons in this case, it found that the procedures were not followed and ruled to dismiss the case. Now, it is learned that Ding Peiyu and her mother, Ding Xu shi, have reported the case to the Putuo Road police, accusing Huang Tongbo of raping Ding Peiyu, a 50-year-old woman, and requesting an investigation. The police immediately ordered an investigation and, in accordance with Article 227, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, filed a public prosecution against Huang Tongbo in the First Special Court for violating public morals. The court issued a summons and, after finding that Huang Tongbo lived at number 863, Avenue Foch in the French Concession, requested the Second Special Court to assist in serving the summons. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant did not appear. Judge Liu, considering that the case concerned public morals, declared that the hearing was closed to the public. After briefly questioning the victims, Ding Peiyu and her mother, he ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e106">A New Life for Patients with Tuberculosis - Philh Weal - The Value of Treating Tuberculosis in Clinical Practice - <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>- Dr. Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>"Philh Weal" is created based on the principles of organ therapy advocated by two major biological authorities, A.A. Berthold of Germany and Starling of England. Its ingredients are endocrine hormones extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of strong animals - a mixed preparation that has undergone rigorous animal testing. It has been used by tuberculosis sanatoriums in various countries around the world for the treatment of human tuberculosis, and has been subjected to long-term clinical trials. It has been confirmed to have extraordinary effects, surpassing all chemical agents. Since ancient times, doctors and patients have regarded tuberculosis (pulmonary tuberculosis) as an incurable disease. Since the discovery of organ therapy with "Philh Weal," it has become a star in modern medicine and has the spirit of sweeping and innovating the treatment field. This unique and latest creation has been recognized worldwide and is not an exaggeration to be regarded as a new life for tuberculosis patients. Now, the characteristics of "Philh Weal" for the treatment of lung diseases are briefly described on the left.</p>
<p>It can harmonize metabolism and promote the function of endocrine glands, and revive deteriorated tissues to achieve vigorous physiological defense function - overcoming tubercle bacilli.</p>
<p>It can fill the defects of lesions according to the function of tissue regeneration, and promote the proliferation of connective tissue, so that lesions form scars, and promote the mechanism of healing, shortening the period.</p>
<p>A solid connective wall is built around the lesion, making it harden. Once this complete dike is created, the tubercle bacilli are blocked, lose their activity, and are ultimately completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Stimulates the function of the spleen to promote vigorous hematopoiesis, which increases body weight and provides good nutrition.</p>
<p>For the infiltration of lesions, it can be absorbed or dissolved, and it can inhibit the secretion of tubercle bacillus toxins and neutralize toxins in the body, resulting in detoxification. Therefore, hot flashes and night sweats can disappear after taking it for several days.</p>
<p>It can increase stomach heat and promote secretion, making digestion vigorous and increasing appetite.</p>
<p>Has a strong clotting power. Regardless of hemoptysis, its prevention effect is very significant.</p>
<p>It can produce specific immune bodies, increase the antitoxic effect in the body, and transform the susceptibility constitution of tuberculosis into a non-susceptible one (i.e., immunity), treating tuberculosis with tuberculosis - preventing tuberculosis without tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Nowadays, major tuberculosis sanatoriums in Europe and the United States have adopted this new organ therapy. According to clinical physicians' reports, tuberculosis patients (stage 1, 2, or 3) who take organ preparations of "Philh Weal" internally for seven or eight days will see their fever decrease, cough reduce, and feel happy in body and mind. Symptoms are alleviated, and the condition improves. If you continue to take it for more than a month, your body weight will increase, and all symptoms will disappear. X-ray examination will reveal that the diseased part has formed a scab and has entered a state of recovery.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Do Young People Want to Walk Towards the Road of Light? You Must Strive to Remove Neurasthenia, Which Destroys Vitality from the Darkness! <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>- Written by Scott Hall, translated by Dr. Xu Shengzhang</p>
<p>The term "neurasthenia," I think you have often heard of it. It is extremely popular among young people. This disease is a major reason for frustrating promising young people in the middle of their studies. Moreover, not only young people, but also older and middle-aged people often suffer from neurasthenia. Therefore, this disease is one of the most common diseases in modern civilized society. It is often found in people who are mentally depressed, physically and mentally overworked, or who use their energy excessively, and who have unlimited sexual intercourse and masturbation. Now I will describe the symptoms of this disease and its general treatment methods as follows:</p>
<p>There are many different symptoms of neurasthenia, which can be divided into two main categories: congenital and acquired.</p>
<p>Acquired Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Generally, the so-called neurasthenia mostly refers to acquired neurasthenia. The main symptoms of this disease are: sleep disorders, scattered attention, memory loss, heaviness of the head, hyperreflexia, etc. In addition, there are symptoms such as headache, fatigue, irritability, dizziness, and tinnitus.</p>
<p>Congenital Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Congenital neurasthenia is also called physical weakness or simply neurasthenia. There are mental symptoms from birth - especially the emotional and volitional symptoms are the most obvious. (Regarding emotions) Hypersensitivity, irritability, easy to anger, bad temper, unpleasantness, feelings of incompetence, inferiority, paying attention to trivial matters, nagging, obsessive ideas, phobias…</p>
<p>Regarding attention, lack of resistance, inability to endure Zhou's affairs, no thinking ability, slow decisions. In severe cases, the nature changes, completely based on oneself, self-indulgent, generous to oneself, thin to others, harsh to people, strong love, fickle and lacking continuity, especially with bad habits such as drinking and debauchery… Although presenting the above symptoms, there is no conscious concept.</p>
<p>Sometimes it presents an extroverted - aggressive personality, can become a fighter, agitator, and easily cause violence. If there is an introverted personality, it will present strange symptoms such as depression, world-weariness, pessimism, suicidal tendencies, and misanthropy.</p>
<p>The above is an overview of neurasthenia. The large number of symptoms and the great harm can be inferred from this.</p>
<p>Dietary Management of Neurasthenia</p>
<p>First, you must first quit mental and physical overwork, and appreciate the scenery of mountains and rivers to broaden your mind, rest, get enough sleep, take walks in the suburbs, breathe fresh air, and get close to the sunlight to keep your body and mind quiet. Smoking and drinking are strictly prohibited, and tea, coffee, etc. must be restricted. Regarding food, avoid salty, spicy, mustard, and other stimulating foods. Other meats and foods that are too stimulating and exciting should also be paid special attention to.</p>
<p>Daily life must also be regular and disciplined. Getting up, eating, bathing, walking, exercising, and resting must all be scheduled at appropriate times. It is strictly forbidden to go to bed late, or to enter game halls, dance halls, obscene conversations, books, etc. The eyes must also avoid seeing them. The excitement of sexual desire and the bad habit of masturbation must be restrained or quit.</p>
<p>Radical Cure for Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Regarding the radical cure for this disease, we must use tonics to nourish the nerves and make them healthy. According to clinical reports from various physicians, "Memory Neurlfc" is the most reliable tonic. Because the brain is the master of the human body and the center of the nervous system, our spirit and physical strength are produced by the brain, so taking "Memory Neurlfc" can restore the vitality of the nerves. After taking it, you will feel refreshed, happy, think agilely, have rosy blood, and your body and mind will be active, so that a weak body and a declining spirit will be transformed into a vigorous and energetic new vitality, and you will embark on a healthy and bright path.</p>
<h3 id="e108">A Young Man Said This <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>- Translated by Xiang Bo, Written by George Foley M.D.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir! It's me, I ejaculate very quickly; I'm surprised, what if this is the result of mistakes in youth," a disappointed man in his thirties groaned and said to me like this. Simply put, this man felt that all the pleasure of his sexual desire had disappeared, because he ejaculated before he got the beauty of sexual behavior. Then, he was ashamed of himself and ridiculed by most women. Dear readers, have you ever had this happen? If it has a pitiful place, let me tell you that 50% to 75% of us men suffer from this trouble. Do you have this pain now? No, I don't hope this sentence is correct.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever told you the time of sexual intercourse? With my knowledge, no one can, and there is no deeper intention in the study of sex life. Don't be surprised, there are many causes of disease in the intercourse of both men and women. Before discussing this issue, it is necessary to understand the normal relationship between the sexes - men and women. Both parties have the right to equal sexual satisfaction. When both sexes absolutely implement equal attempts, men should abandon the old concept that women are not always passive and indifferent. In fact, she is sometimes as enthusiastic as a volcano and as boiling as boiling water.</p>
<p>Oh, let's pay attention to ordinary human sexual behavior, see how he opens his lips to smile, what a high-spirited expression, and also say: "The world is for you." You look carefully, he is still pursuing: "I just made a woman get pleasure." In fact, did he want to give that woman grace? In fact, she didn't get any pleasure; soon, she became neurotic as if she got the result of sexual dissatisfaction. Sex is a powerful thing, and it must not be followed when it is attacked on the one hand; however, many wives have no way to protest their husbands' short-lived passion, for fear of being ridiculed for obscenity, how sad.</p>
<p>The social sky unfolds a new picture. Our divorce courts become the wives' difficult situations. They refuse to become chronically ill due to their husbands' premature ejaculation. Smart judges with in-depth research know the exact reasons covered up. Friends! You must know that quiet and keen women can never shout out: "My husband is impotent"! Most of them are silent, and the most become "I am crazy"! It is too obvious.</p>
<p>"How can I make my husband strong?" A noble woman asked me: "If there is no way to treat him, he will make me depressed and make me comatose. Because my husband is a noble character, I want to help him." Readers! If your husband or yourself is indeed a patient with premature ejaculation, don't worry, don't hesitate, quickly take a piece of the endocrine combination preparation "WELL TONIC" for internal use, this is the most effective treatment, and the meaning is obvious, the effect of the husband's premature ejaculation on her. Such a construction implementation does not know how many millions.</p>
<p>A doctor said from experience: "Because a man ejaculates early, he is impotent, do you think this is the true meaning? Such a man can also have children." Yes! This meaning can be occasionally correct; but in theory, such a man's sexual desire is weakened! If they cannot make their wives get pleasure, they sometimes ask other women who can help her, but they can never ask men, because he is too proud.</p>
<p>Dull husbands never believe his wife, he would rather follow their own opinions, this is the closing scene of dull sexual knowledge. Well! We don't stop being husbands. After he enters the sacred marriage bed, he quickly approaches his wife, and the speed of ejaculation and the urgency of retreat are unparalleled. This is not the sexual intercourse of sexual desire, it is the insult of God's pure love, and it is not a happy thing for women. In the future, both will be cruelly rewarded. No wonder most women are referred to as indifferent, or how else can they be! "Men never understand women" is an old saying, with a slight bias; I think we can try to understand the nature of women in a very short time; but until we are liberated from stupid ideas, we cannot be opposed, the relationship between men and women is the most beautiful and sacred in the world.</p>
<p>Men must understand this and abandon all cruelty. Love should be pure, eliminate all hypocrisy, and don't aim to solve your own sexual desire. The wife's nature is expecting pleasure in every sexual intercourse. You must drive away all previous fears and failures. You are harming your wife, making her crazy, and blaming. Remember! Such fears are all the result of premature ejaculation.</p>
<p>When you approach your wife, take your time, be calm, want to get enough love, and also practice having a restraint. When you are extremely enthusiastic, you must take it back, rest for a while, and even let it completely calm down. These experienced facts often let her and your soul develop and get complete pleasure.</p>
<p>You ask me how long the pleasure of love is. According to recent investigations, most of them are two or three minutes, and there are very few. These moments of lingering enthusiasm for men and weak sexual stimulation for women are very safe without any drawbacks. If you continue to take them for several weeks, you will definitely get the effect of fully enjoyable recovery of sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>Editor's note: "WELL TONIC" is a combined preparation of various endocrine elements of testes glands, adrenal glands, thyroid glands, and pituitary glands of young animals. It is recognized by scholars in various countries in modern times as an effective medicine for treating male reproductive dysfunction - impotence, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, spermatorrhea, short genitals, and sexual neurasthenia.

<p>Opening expenses of 60,000 yuan have been allocated, and personnel have been sent to Peiping for preparation. The selection of the library director and the appointment of staff require long-term consideration.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Peiping) The Japanese Cultural Enterprise Department plans to establish an Oriental Library in Peiping, with an opening cost of 60,000 yuan. Personnel have already been sent to Peiping to investigate suitable locations. According to news from educational circles who have studied in Japan, the Japanese Cultural Enterprise Department believes that although the national capital has moved south, Peiping remains the cultural center of China, and there are still many academic institutions in Peiping. The largest library in Peiping, the Peiping Library, has a large collection of ancient Chinese books and Western books, but relatively few Japanese books. Although the Peking University Library has Japanese literature, it is only for the use of teachers and students. The library of the Peking University Law and Commerce College also has a large collection of Japanese books, mostly on law, politics, and economics, but they are not accessible to people outside the university. The library that the Japanese Cultural Enterprise Department plans to establish will be open to the public. In addition to ancient books, it will comprehensively collect newly published Japanese books on social sciences, natural sciences, literature, philosophy, and education for public access. Funding is not an issue, but the selection of the library director and the appointment of staff require long-term consideration. As for the location, there are more schools in the western part of Peiping than in the eastern part, and most intellectuals outside the education sector also live in the Xidan Pailou and Xisi Pailou areas, so the Oriental Library is planned to be located in the western part of the city.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Lu Province Increases Funding for Education <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch, Last year, the province expanded compulsory education, and more than 2,000 short-term elementary schools were added throughout the province, with excellent results. Now, the Ministry of Education has instructed the provincial government to list compulsory education as the central task, and when preparing the budget for the 25th year, to increase the funding for compulsory education by more than double that of the previous year, and to formulate an implementation plan and report the exact amount of increased funding to the Ministry of Education for approval before May 15, etc. The Department of Education believes that the Ministry has clearly stipulated that the principle is that half of the funding for compulsory education in each province should be raised by the provinces themselves. Jiangsu, Hebei, Henan, and Anhui provinces have all allocated large sums of money from their provincial treasuries to be used specifically for compulsory education. The funding for compulsory education in this province, in addition to the supplementary funding from the central government, is allocated from the compulsory education fund turned over to the province by various counties and the repayment of military funds from the 18th and 19th years, and no funds have been drawn from the provincial treasury. The budget for the 24th year lists 709,076 yuan. If the order from the Ministry of Education is followed, and the funding is doubled in the 25th year, it should be 1.41 million yuan. In addition to the 320,000 yuan or so that can be allocated from the repayment of military funds from the 18th and 19th years, and the 170,000 yuan that has been eroded from the compulsory education fund, there is still a shortfall of more than 920,000 yuan. Today (the 1st), the Director of Education He Siyuan of the Department of Education raised this issue at the provincial government's political meeting, requesting instructions on how to raise this 920,000+ yuan, as it concerns the future of compulsory education. After discussion, it was decided to hand over the matter to the Department of Finance and the Department of Education for consideration.</p>

<p>After cotton market delivery, prices fell sharply. Although the bulls tried to purchase goods, a large amount of coarse cotton could not be sold for a time, and inventories increased. Generally, many floating bulls, aware of the situation, painfully closed their positions. The shorts, who had been trapped for a long time, seized the opportunity and market prices fell even more sharply.</p>

<p>At the opening of the spot cotton market, due to good demand for American cotton, prices rose by nine to thirteen points, Indian cotton rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee, and Osaka's three-grade cotton rose by 2.3. However, the daily decline was very large. Some shorts covered their positions, rebounding by two cents. Unexpectedly, during the second session, there were many rumors in the market claiming there would be another American cotton loan. Selling intensified, and market prices plummeted, with each month's contract falling sharply by fifty or sixty cents. During the second and third sessions, the market was flat. Records show that Dachangcheng and Shengyuan bulls closed their positions, while shorts increased their positions. Tongji bought in the morning and sold in the afternoon. As a result, each month's contract fell by 1.5 to 3.5 cents compared to the previous day's close. In the afternoon, near-month contracts opened flat and weak, but recovered in far-month contracts due to large-scale short covering, leading to increased tightness on the trading floor. The second session turned to decline, but by the third close, prices trended upward. Tongji hedged a large amount of new October cotton, and as a result, each month's contract rose by five cents to two, three, or four cents. It was found that Shenchang sold 6,200 piculs, Xingchang 3,400 piculs, Yuanyi 4,200 piculs, Dachangcheng 7,500 piculs, Yichang 2,900 piculs, Shengyuan 10,400 piculs, Yongda 3,100 piculs, Tongji 9,500 piculs, Yuanxingchang 4,400 piculs, Tongfeng 2,000 piculs, and Yangcheng 700 piculs.

Cotton merchants hedged July, and cotton hoarders sold May. Each month fell by one to three points. Domestic firms bought for foreign firms, and off-exchange trades were flat.

English spot cotton fell by two points and futures fell by three points. Indian cotton weakened due to cotton merchants' hedging, old bulls closing positions, and a lack of buyers. In particular, Pingguoer fell by 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, and Bairoxi fell by 0.75 to 1 rupee.</p>
<p>On the first of the month, the American cotton market opened.

There was hedging of credit cotton, but buying interest remained strong. The cotton hoarding agency sold May contracts at 11.51 cents. Off-exchange trading was peaceful, and brokers bought slightly. New cotton remained strong due to buying interest. The spot market was sluggish and textiles were quiet. This week's sales volume was below production volume.

<p>The day before yesterday (the 1st), the flour market, with the clear weather, the long-depressed situation finally began to show. The opening prices for each month fell sharply by three, four, or five cents. The major factories had their files, and the floating shorts also took the opportunity to sell. Afterwards, trading remained active, but the market was hovering, only slightly lower than the initial opening. By the afternoon opening, the downward trend was somewhat stabilized, but trading was still lively. The market price for each month was similar to the morning closing price. Total turnover for the day reached one million, and the October contract was auctioned as usual, opening at 3.025 yuan and closing one cent higher, for a total decline of 1.5 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), the flour market reported that wheat prices in Chicago fell by 40 cents for near-term contracts and 20 cents for far-term contracts. Canadian wheat fell by 24 cents. Later, due to light rain, sentiment stabilized somewhat, and there was some reflection on the previous day's sharp decline. However, at the beginning of the second session, because factories continued to release their files and Changjiang Mei also followed suit, the market fell again. Off-exchange bulls also disposed of a large amount of their holdings, so the decline in near-term opening prices was even greater. By the afternoon opening, the number of factories exiting had slowed, but off-exchange selling was still enthusiastic. The June contract was previously inverted, with more selling, and was now equal to the July contract, reaching a low of 3.04 yuan, a sharp decline of 15 cents from the previous week's high. Although the other months also fell successively, the comparison was still moderate. The decline has been going on for two days since May, and according to the market situation, there are still signs of continued weakness.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday (the 1st), wheat futures prices in all months fell sharply, as sentiment within and outside the industry eased unanimously. In addition, the flour market fell sharply, so except for the June opening price, which was still stable, the rest fell sharply. Afterwards, trading was very active, and prices eased again, falling by about 10 cents compared with the previous month's closing price. By the afternoon opening, trading in the June and July contracts slowed, while trading in the August contract was very active, but prices had stabilized and did not fall further. In the spot wheat market, due to the sharp fall in standards, asking prices also eased, with each grade asking for five cents lower. Shandong Yaowan wheat was offered at 5.23 yuan, and 1,000 bags were purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 2nd), wheat futures were initially stable but then fell. Initially, sentiment was stable despite reports of falling wheat prices abroad due to unfavorable weather. However, the flour market's sharp decline caused selling pressure from within and outside the industry to suddenly increase, and asking prices for each month fell by about three to five cents. By the afternoon opening, trading in the June contract was very quiet, and prices recovered slightly. The July contract and beyond remained flat. According to industry observers, if the weather is favorable thereafter, this year's wheat harvest may be better than last year, so the downward trend may reappear due to increased production, which is also unknown. Spot wheat trading was very quiet, and prices fell slightly by two cents. Shandong Yaowan wheat was offered at 5.20 yuan, and 300-400 bags were purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday's rice market saw a continuous supply from various places, with shipments arriving from various ports along the Yangtze River and Wenzhou-Taizhou areas. The street was only slightly decorated. Rice sales were sluggish, and merchants, fearing the heat and sluggish sales, found it difficult to hold on. Yesterday, one merchant was already selling at a discount in the market, and sentiment was extremely weak. Moreover, with the decline in wheat and other grains, the rice market was even more lifeless, and prices immediately continued to decline by five or six cents to one dime. If future arrivals are strong and sales are not robust, market prices will inevitably ease further. Yesterday, 2,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 355 bags of Taiwan rice, 350 bags of Jiangbei rice, 100 bags of Shashi rice, and 200 bags of Siamese rice were offered, all of which were sold by this street.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over ten shipments arrived from various sources, totaling more than 3,000 piculs, of which thin rice accounted for five or six shipments. Sales were sluggish in both retail and wholesale markets, so even though arrivals were scarce, the market situation was not only difficult to show improvement but also difficult to support. Thick early japonica rice was flat and weak. Thin rice parcels were still only purchased by Tianjin merchants. Prices fell by a few more cents. Du Yangjian and Yin Xieyuan rice showed no change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 30 shipments arrived from various places. Sales of various goods in the market improved slightly. Prices for white japonica rice of high quality were stable, while prices for medium-grade rice secretly tightened. Thin rice was stable. Yin Yuan and other varieties showed no price fluctuations. White Yuan of high quality was stable, while medium-grade rice tightened by a few cents. Prices of other goods remained the same as before.</p>

<p>Since opening at 13 yuan, the foreign sesame market has remained tight. In short, with high oil prices, this raw material for oil extraction is bound to prosper. Therefore, yesterday, the Dongyang merchant purchased 100 tons at a price of 13.1 yuan, which is another dime higher than the previous market. The overall trend is still brisk. Foreign firms are placing orders for ordinary new rapeseed for future delivery. Previously, 2,000 bags were offered for delivery in July and August at a price of 8.4 yuan. Recently, there has been further restraint. According to the trend, prices will continue to rise and not fall. Due to unfavorable weather and damaged harvests, traders dare not sell in large quantities, so since the price was offered, the number of transactions has not yet reached 6,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, although the tax reduction had not yet been implemented, the sugar market was weak due to the abundance of smuggled goods from North China. The guild's planned prices for 34 coarse white sand and Dong Chi white were not achieved. The factory's refined white sugar also showed signs of weakness. The price of domestic Chaozhou sugar increased by 5 yuan in Shantou, while the production prices of green and red sugar were slightly lower, so it was difficult to maintain the original asking price. Only 200 bags of ordinary semi-South green sugar were offered at 9.7 yuan, slightly lower than the usual price. More than 100 bags of Zhi Chi sugar were offered at 12.2 to 12.5 yuan, slightly lower by 12 cents. More than 40 cases of Xiangzhuang Pianqing sugar were offered with the Hua gang at 8.6 yuan.</p>

Only 10 bags of Qu Xi factory's goods were sold at 21.6 yuan. The remaining No. 2 and No. 4 refined white sugar and medium white sand remained unsold at the original price.</p>

<p>Since the Guangdong merchant started buying dried lily flowers, inventories have become increasingly thin. It is now known that there is also a shortage of stocks in Hong Kong, with total stocks less than 100 pieces, while the number of stocks in Zhenjiang is only a few hundred pieces. However, Shanghai has more inventories, most of which are in the hands of experts, but the number is actually not large. Therefore, the branded goods are being firmly held. Yesterday, it was heard that the top-grade vegetables have been opened at 35 yuan, which is another 23 yuan higher than before, and the rest have also tightened accordingly. It is expected that since Hong Kong stocks are lacking, the digestion in Guangdong and Hong Kong may increase in the future, and there is a risk of further rise, because there are still two months before the sales period.</p>

<p>Although the end of the month has passed for the cotton cloth market, yarn and cotton prices have continued to fall, actual sales remain sluggish, and the market is depressed. The prices of various goods continue to decline. However, some believe that the factories are unanimously firm and that the upcoming tender for 16-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth for military use can absorb the huge output of various factories, preventing market surpluses, so they are watching the market with a stable attitude. However, sentiment remains uncertain. The most severe decline in white goods now is in high-grade fine cloth from eastern merchants, such as those from Longtou and Wufu Jixiang. Their previous selling prices were three to four dimes higher than Yanghe fine cloth from Tongxing Factory, but because sales of colored cloth are very sluggish and demand has been drastically reduced, the current selling price is very close to Yanghe's. Trumpet Boy fine cloth has also seen the largest decline because Tianjin merchants, the largest sales channel, have not taken action. It is now selling for only 6.7 yuan. Various merchants in the market are adding very small amounts. Guangdong merchants have purchased more than 30 pieces of lower-grade fine cloth from Sulun Shenxin Factory, and more than 100 pieces of fine twill from various dyeing and weaving factories in Changzhou. The price is also slightly lower by one dime per piece. Sichuan merchants have imported 30 to 40 boxes of colored cloth from factories such as Xiexiang and Fengfeng, and more than 20 boxes of Tiaofu fine cloth and Tiao yarn from Tiaofu. More than ten packages of Shuanglongzhu fine cloth from eastern merchants are said to be imported.</p>

<p>The business of selling Western clothes to foreign warships on the Huangpu River, which was previously done by tailor shops in Hongkou going on board, has recently been banned by all warships, resulting in sluggish business for tailors in Hongkou and many closures. Even woolen cloth dismantling shops have recently moved to Qipan Street. Most of the suits on ships of various countries have been custom-made in Hong Kong and Japan in recent years. Although labor costs are higher than in Shanghai, the wool is cheaper than in Shanghai due to tax reasons, which has affected the business in Shanghai.</p>

<p>— A Teacher</p>
<p>Little friends! Here are a few creeds for success, which can serve as guidelines for our studies and work!</p>
<p>Do things in the clear-headed and refreshing morning; not in the exhausted late night.</p>
<p>With the spirit of hard work, the matter is already half successful.</p>
<p>Hands in pockets cannot climb the ladder.</p>
<p>Plan your work with all your mind; execute your plan with all your mind.</p>
<p>The solution to the matter lies only in your determination.</p>
<p>Do not only do ready-made things; be able to find things to do yourself.</p>
<p>Sitting and watching is not as good as taking action.</p>
<p>Absorb a large amount of knowledge, and chew it slowly.</p>
<p>People who are jealous of others' success will never succeed themselves.</p>
<p>An ambitious person does not necessarily do what they like; they only care about liking to do what should be done.</p>
<p>Correct thinking should be followed by action.</p>
<p>Use normal thinking to do extraordinary undertakings.</p>
<p>A genius is good at seizing opportunities already obtained.</p>
<p>Keep working hard at all times, and success is not far away.</p>

<p>(Thirteenth Place)</p>
<p>Generally, a person's ambition is very great at the beginning; but in the end, it is difficult for one or two out of ten people to achieve their goals. Investigating the reason for this, what is it? For the most part, they can only say it with their mouths, but they cannot truly bury their heads in hard work, which is truly the most laughable thing. You must know that no matter what matter, what desire, will never succeed by just talking about it, you must go and do it, and then you can succeed.</p>
<p>I have no extravagant desires. Now I only hope to be a good student and a good citizen in the future. Today's students are the good pillars of the country in the future, the good members of society, and the good children of the family. I dare to boldly say that among today's students, it is difficult to find three or four out of ten who are good. Most of today's students only know how to talk about freedom and equality, but they do not pay attention to old virtues, such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, and peace. Therefore, now, if you want to be a good student, you should practice a new life, cultivate noble morals, cultivate profound knowledge, exercise a strong physique, develop cooperative habits, cultivate the perfection of inner and outer heart, earnestly study, and strive to be a person, and then you can win glory for the country, seek happiness for the people, and add honor to the ancestors, and be a true, good, and beautiful good student; therefore, I am working hard now, and I want to be a good student in the future.</p>

<p>— By Xin Qing</p>
<p>He never knew what contours and light and shadow were, nor did he know the method of dissection, but he relied on his own talent and perseverance to patiently paint, and finally completed this portrait. The lonely and lonely old woodcutter on the painting is indeed a very good poem, sitting on that dead tree, quietly as if thinking about something. Behind him is a touch of dusk, covering the old man. This painting is of course very rough, and also has many weaknesses; but fortunately, there is a word "true", on which you can see the truth of nature and the truth of art, containing infinite beauty in the bleakness. After Mother Nature finished her work, Bodey often lay quietly here, watching his little master patiently do his work, and he didn't know how many hours he had spent before and after. It knew that Little Nanluo had a hope, which could be said to be not very certain, because he was determined to complete this painting and send it out to participate in the competition, hoping to get an annual bonus of two hundred francs. This competition was held in Angfanru, and all children under the age of eighteen, whether they were students or farmers, as long as they could paint, sent their works made of lead powder and pencil, and the great painters in Sanluo City served as judges, selecting the most talented little painter and giving him a bonus of two hundred francs.</p>
<p>In the spring, summer, and autumn of this year, Little Nanluo perked up his spirits and worked on this painting. If it was successfully completed and won the championship, then he would be one step closer to his self-reliance movement, and his love for that mysterious art would have a kind of ardent emotion.</p>
<p>He kept the secret strictly and did not tell anyone: his grandfather would not understand this matter, and he was estranged from Xiao Ailuo. He only told Bodey everything, and said in a low voice: "I think Luo Bensi will definitely award me the first prize."</p>
<p>All the paintings participating in the competition were limited to being sent on December 1st, and the results of the judging were also scheduled to be announced on the 24th, so if he won the prize, then by Christmas, he could be happy with his old grandfather and Bodey.</p>
<p>On a cold winter day, just as it was dawning, his heart was pounding, sometimes full of hope, sometimes full of fear, putting the painting on the green cart for delivering milk, helped by Bodey, and together they sent it to the town, until the front of that public building. He timidly thought to himself: "Maybe this painting is not worth a penny, who knows?" He left the painting, and he felt it was a risky and unconscious thing. Imagine how a barefoot poor boy who doesn't even know how to read can attract those great painters to look at his childish works?</p>
<p>He happily walked past the cathedral, as if he saw the shadow of the ancient great painter Luo Bensi, very great, very solemn, now in the dark canal, his lips contained a kind smile, as if murmuring: "Don't be afraid! When I was making my painting name in Angfan'er, my heart was also full of courage." Little Nanluo ran home in this cold night, and received infinite comfort.</p>
<p>He had done his best, and the rest was up to God. Originally, he often worshiped the Holy Lord wholeheartedly in the small chapel among the willows and poplars, and established a kind of unshakable faith.</p>
<p>The winter weather had long been extremely cold. That night, they returned home, and it snowed heavily, for several days in a row, completely covering the paths in the village and the fields, and all the small rivers and streams were frozen, and the plains were terribly cold. In such a cold winter, it was indeed a very difficult thing to go out early in the morning to deliver milk. At that time, the sky had not yet dawned, the whole world was pitch black, and they delivered the milk to the quiet town in the darkness.</p>

<h3 id="e185">The Sericulture Industry in Changzhou <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Fan</p>
<p>"In the fourth month, there is little leisure in the countryside, just finished with sericulture and then transplanting rice seedlings." This spring seems colder than in previous years, but in the rural areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the "busy sericulture" has already begun.</p>
<p>Changzhou is a very important sericulture area in Jiangsu's territory. The annual export of silkworm cocoons is worth hundreds of thousands of yuan; therefore, although sericulture is a rural sideline, it is a large income item in the rural areas here! Here, the silkworm season is divided into two periods, spring and autumn. Each period has 120,000 sheets of silkworm eggs and more than 40,000 loads of cocoons. If each load is calculated at 30 yuan, each period can get more than 100,000 yuan. If the weather is good and the mulberry fields have a bumper harvest, it will be more than this number. However, in the past, the villagers mostly used the old methods of sericulture, which resulted in the quality of the silkworm cocoons being quite inconsistent; and "cuī qīng" (cuī qīng means drying silkworms), which wasted a lot of manpower. Therefore, Changzhou established a sericulture improvement institution two years ago, which is handled by each county in different districts; its nature is to specialize in cultivating sericulture talents and guiding the sericulture industry.</p>
<p>The Changzhou sericulture improvement area is located in the county seat; Benniu, Henglin, Qishuyan, Shu Dai, Dongtang, Xia Yi Bridge, and Li River Bridge, all towns have sericulture guidance centers, specializing in "cuī qīng" and guiding silkworm breeding work. Each center has two or three instructors, mostly students from sericulture specialized schools or graduates of the school, a total of more than forty people, and the monthly expenses are said to be about 2,000 yuan; the office buildings are mostly provided by the "town offices", so there is no need to spend any rent.</p>
<p>The work of these instructors, in short, is a disguised form of "sericulture maids". This kind of work is very heavy, especially when the "cuī qīng" starts. Here, the "cuī qīng" start date is April 7th, but the official "silkworm rack" date is the 10th; it takes ten days from "cuī qīng" to "entering the flat basket" - that is, the bamboo-made flat basket - to complete, and if the weather is warm, it only takes seven days. The temperature of "cuī qīng" is different every day for ten days; the first day is 62 degrees, and then it is increased day by day, until 78 degrees, which is the last day of "incubating the eggs".</p>
<p>There is another room for "cuī qīng". The layout inside is very simple. There is a triangular wooden frame, with bamboo flat baskets placed in each compartment, and an old-fashioned brazier underneath. There is a thermometer hanging on the wall; these few utensils are the "mother body" for nurturing hundreds of millions of small lives. The four walls of the room and the windows are pasted with layers of paper, and not a single breeze can get in; the ground is paved with square bricks, which is convenient for watering, which is what is called "replenishing moisture". The staff in this room cannot leave this place for a single step all day long. The "guideline" for their work is entirely based on the thermometer hanging on the wall; when the weather is cold, they have to burn charcoal to increase the heat in the room, and conversely, they have to water the ground to "replenish moisture" and lower the temperature; they have to pay attention to the rise and fall of the temperature at all times to maintain a balanced state.</p>
<p>On the day when "cuī qīng" starts - the 7th - the local villagers all come to the guidance center to order silkworm eggs. The silkworm eggs are divided into two types: "boxed" and "paper version". The "boxed eggs" are also called "foreign eggs", which is a wooden frame five inches long and three inches wide, with gauze pasted on both sides, shaped like a cigarette case, so it has this name. The "paper version eggs" are a thick piece of paper the size of a calendar card, with twelve circles drawn on it, and each circle is distributed with a number of silkworm eggs, which at first glance looks like a flat globe. The price of these two types of silkworm eggs is uniformly four corners. The guidance center does the "cuī qīng" on behalf of the villagers, without charging extra fees, but if there are too many silkworm eggs, a certain amount of charcoal fee will be charged as appropriate. After the villagers have ordered the silkworm eggs and written their names, they hand over the silkworm eggs to the instructors for "cuī qīng". According to the regulations here, if the number of silkworm eggs exceeds two to eight sheets, the silkworm farmers must send one person to the guidance center to help. If there are more than ten sheets, two people must be sent. The people sent by the silkworm farmers to practice must absolutely follow the instructions of the instructors for all sericulture procedures, such as "cuī qīng", "replenishing moisture", "loading flat baskets", "applying leaves", "going up the mountain" - the cocooning period - etc., all of which are contrary to the old methods. It is said that in the early days of operation, most of the villagers did not understand the benefits of scientific silkworm breeding, and mostly expressed doubts about this method of sericulture, which made a group of instructors speak until their tongues were parched, and they still could not make them believe it, so there were very few people who came to the guidance center to buy eggs; but after a year of factual performance, the general ignorant and ignorant silkworm farmers sighed in admiration. This year, the silkworm farmers were unusually enthusiastic about buying eggs from the guidance center. From the 7th to the 10th, it is said that the entire Changzhou has sold as many as 120,000 sheets of new eggs, which is an unprecedented phenomenon; however, the staff of the guidance centers everywhere are also busy "happy", although there are still silkworm farmers assisting.</p>
<p>The silkworm farmers practice at the guidance center for a maximum of ten days, but if the weather is warm, it only takes about seven days. When the young silkworms "enter the flat basket", they each go back to raise them, and at the same time, the second batch of silkworm farmers for "cuī qīng" also come up. Therefore, although the "cuī qīng" period is stipulated to be ten days, the work of the instructors is twice this number. When all the silkworm farmers' requests for "cuī qīng" are over, the instructors' work is considered to have reached the first step of completion. The beginning of the second step of work is to go to the homes of the silkworm farmers who have been "cuī qīng" by the guidance center to guide the breeding, observe the moisture content of the mulberry leaves, the height of the temperature, and the evolution of the silkworm eggs; these many situations must be filled into the form one by one. This kind of work is more difficult than "cuī qīng", because the residences of the silkworm farmers in each village are extremely remote, and the mountain roads are rugged. Every day, from Village A to Village B or Village C, you have to walk five or six miles or more than ten miles. They have to start from the office at about 6:00 am every day. If they are strong, they can only walk to three or five villages a day; if it rains or blows wind, it is simply exhausting and they can't run to three silkworm farmers. After more than twenty days, they reach the "going up the mountain" period, but the busy work is forced again, because the silkworms "go up the mountain" are mostly only one or two days away. In this short and most-ending period when the work is about to be completed, they simply don't dare to let go of any place easily. Even if they are sometimes unable to spare the time due to time constraints, the general silkworm farmers are unwilling to let the instructors not come to work. Therefore, during this "going up the mountain" period, a group of instructors have all become "fragrant", and the silkworm farmers are willing to spend a lot of money on lavish hospitality, but a group of instructors are busy to the point where they don't even have time to eat. During the "going up the mountain" period, the previous major needs seven days. During this time, the instructors have to inspect the diseased silkworms for the silkworm farmers every day, and guide them to organize the "rice straw" - which is used by the silkworms to "go up the mountain". The so-called rice straw is to cut the rice stalks into lengths of about a foot, divide them into two bundles, and wrap them with grass rope in the middle, shaped similar to "crisp hair flowers", but several times thicker. When the silkworms reach the time to "go up the mountain", they take it and put it on the "rice straw", allowing them to spin silk and bind themselves! The work of the instructors is considered to be fully completed at this point, which takes a total of more than forty days.</p>
<p>The work of the instructors is in the spring and autumn seasons, so their remuneration is also issued on a seasonal basis, simply speaking, it is a contracting system. A new instructor who has just left school gets a salary of 60 yuan per season - including food. If they have two years of experience or have excellent grades in school, they get a salary of 80 to 85 yuan per season. It is said that 40 instructors were sent out by the Changzhou sericulture area this year, and one-third of them are students who have not graduated from sericulture school, and they were sent out by the school to follow up and practice; the salary of these trainees is uniformly 30 yuan per person, and after deducting travel expenses and food, which cost more than ten yuan, the remaining amount must be handed over to the school as school expenses. In addition to receiving regular salaries, it is said that these instructors also have a kind of performance reward, but the amount is not certain.</p>

<h3 id="e187">On Xiaopinwen (Short Essays) <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Xian</p>
<p>The *xiaopinwen* is the darling of modern literature, beloved by a group of literary figures. Indeed, it possesses an inherent power to be loved. Especially now, most young literary people are learning to write *xiaopinwen*, so its importance is beyond doubt. However, what exactly is the essence of the *xiaopinwen*? This question is probably what every author wants to understand!</p>
<p>What is a *xiaopinwen*? Many scholars in China have discussed it, but it is difficult to find a satisfactory and accurate understanding.</p>
<p>In Western literature, works of this genre are called Essays. Some also use the term "Sketch," as used by Mr. [George] Santayana, as a name for this type of writing. Essay, translated by Mr. Zhou Zuoren as "論文" [thesis] or "美文" [belle-lettres], is not very appropriate. LF. Young once gave the following explanation of literary Essays: "A literary Essay occupies a convenient position between fictional works and rigorous scientific and philosophical treatises. It is suitable for any topic, reported in a pleasant, relaxed, and clear form, and presents a framework for examining an argument. It is a lovable tool for authors to express their thoughts on any subject." Although he explained some of the characteristics of the *xiaopinwen*, his overall understanding is still insufficient.</p>
<p>A more accurate definition would be that of Mr. Xia Mianzun: "From the perspective of external length, short articles of two or three hundred words, or even up to a thousand words, are called *xiaopinwen*. The distinction between long articles and *xiaopinwen* is determined only by external form. Therefore, the content and nature of *xiaopinwen* are entirely free. It can narrate events, contain arguments, express emotions, or describe scenery, without any restrictions. ... *Xiaopinwen* have existed in China since ancient times. For example, the *xiaopinwen* of Su Dongpo are very famous. The common so-called "隨筆" [jottings] can also be regarded as a type of *xiaopinwen*. Recently, *xiaopinwen* have become even more popular in various countries; and the style is very different from what we traditionally called *xiaopinwen*. The current *xiaopinwen* is actually a translation of "Sketch." They generally express real feelings or a part of real life in fragmented writing."</p>
<p>Feng Sanmei also offered a more precise explanation in his lectures on *xiaopinwen*: "The so-called *xiaopinwen* refers to texts with simple content and short form. *Xiaopinwen* can also narrate events and reason, but its essence is mainly the expression of emotion. Intense and profound emotions can create various lengthy masterpieces, but if they are not so intense and also represent a corner of real life, wanting to preserve them from disappearing rashly, then the *xiaopinwen* is truly a supreme tool. Although the form of the *xiaopinwen* is prose, its nature is close to poetry. It cannot be as loose as ordinary writing, nor as compact as general poetry. If there is a middle ground between poetry and prose, besides prose poetry, then it is a new flower in this region."</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Shi also has a few noteworthy words, he said: "Using plain conversation, containing profound meaning, sometimes it seems clumsy, but it is actually humorous." The "滑稽" [clumsy, comical] mentioned here seems to be quite problematic and falls into superficiality. It should be changed to "幽默" [humor] or "諧趣" [wittiness], because humor and wittiness are conditions that a *xiaopinwen* should possess. In summary, we should arrive at the following more perfect conclusion: *Xiaopinwen* is a short article that expresses and critiques a corner or fragment of life's real feelings with concise, humorous, and meaningful words, and lighthearted skill.</p>
<p>The *xiaopinwen* is a secluded realm of humor in the garden of art, not as broad and vast as the ancients said. Mr. Zhong Jingwen once said: "...The ancients seemed to refer to articles of not too long a length when they mentioned *xiaopin*, and their style combined argumentation, prefaces, postscripts, biographies, epitaphs, etc., and the content included descriptions of scenery, narratives, expressions of emotion, and arguments. According to this, it is not much different from ordinary articles, only shorter."</p>
<p>*Xiaopinwen* is not just a short article; it has its own stylistic characteristics. The Japanese writer Hakuson Kuriyagawa said in his book *From the Ivory Tower*: "If it is winter, sit in a comfortable chair next to the heater; if it is summer, wear a bathrobe and sip fragrant tea, casually chatting with good friends, and simply transferring these words to paper is an Essay. As inspiration strikes, one may say some principles that are not too headache-inducing, there are also cold taunts and aphorisms, there is both Humor (滑稽 [comedy]) and Pathos (感奮 [exhilaration]), the topics discussed range from major national and global affairs to trivial matters in the market, critiques of books, news of acquaintances, and recollections of one's past. Whatever comes to mind is freely discussed, relying on the impromptu pen; this is this type of article." This is enough to illustrate the style of *xiaopinwen* and the sources of its subject matter.</p>
<p>Here we must compare *xiaopinwen* with other literary works:</p>
<p>1. *Xiaopinwen* and Poetry. Although *xiaopinwen* often has lyrical expressions, that is the type of *xiaopinwen* that is rich in poetic meaning. But poetry is, after all, not *xiaopinwen*. Poetry relies on rhyme as a necessary condition, while *xiaopinwen* does not.</p>
<p>2. *Xiaopinwen* and Novels. *Xiaopinwen* and novels can be distinguished by their structure and expression methods. After selecting the subject matter, a novel must undergo considerable arrangement, with a strict structure. The characters, background, dialogue, and narration have all undergone a series of considerations, and then they are expressed with economical skill. The *xiaopinwen* is different. As mentioned above, it uses an "impromptu" method to express a corner of life that suits its purpose; its structure cannot be as strict as that of a novel.</p>
<p>3. *Xiaopinwen* and Argumentative Essays. *Xiaopinwen* is sometimes also an argument on matters of reason or imagery. Many *xiaopinwen* use a cold and stern style to target the front of a certain matter of reason, or lightly tap from the side with a tone of cold sarcasm, and readers feel another kind of clear and cold breath assaults their lungs. But *xiaopinwen* is not, after all, an argumentative essay, because it is still based on its impromptu technique and does not have the formal structure that an argumentative essay should have.</p>
<p>4. *Xiaopinwen* and Drama. Sometimes the author of a *xiaopinwen* also uses the form of drama and simple dialogue methods to complete his writing of *xiaopinwen*, but such examples are rare. For example, Ms. Chen Hengzhe's *The Canal and the Yangtze River*, we always regard as a *xiaopinwen* and do not consider it a drama.</p>
<p>5. *Xiaopinwen* and Diaries. Most *xiaopinwen* take the form of casual talk or jottings, but there is a special form! Diaries and letters</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>, also occupy an important position. Mr. Yu Dafu said: Diary literature is a core in literature and a treasure outside the orthodox. The reason why diary *xiaopinwen* are so deeply moving is precisely because they are a revelation of true feelings, without the need for affectation. They are flawless white jade.</p>
<p>6. *Xiaopinwen* and Letters. *Xiaopinwen* in letter form are also treasures in literature. Mr. Zhou Zuoren said that diaries and letters are particularly interesting things in literature because they express the author's personality more clearly than other articles. Ms. Bing Xin's *To Young Readers*, with its gentle and beautiful diction, innocent and rich feelings, many readers love it. As for the *Three Leaves Collection* by Guo Moruo, Tian Han, and Zong Baihua, how do they discuss life's problems? Righteous, magnificent, and melancholic, full of passionate and intense emotions, it is also a very good *xiaopinwen*.</p>
<p>7. *Xiaopinwen* and Prose Poetry. In some cases, there is simply no clear boundary to distinguish between *xiaopinwen* and prose poetry. We know that there are many *xiaopinwen* that contain a lot of poetic meaning, and the structural form is not very different from prose poetry. Kimura Ki said: "It must not be forgotten that prose has been able to develop to this day because it has borrowed a lot from poetry's effort and skill." Kimura Ki once cited an example of the boundary between poetry and prose: all day; from morning to night; from the time when the morning mist hangs until the time when the crickets chirp. can only express the simple state of daily affairs and cannot be regarded as an expression of special thoughts and feelings. expression, one enters another world. It does not directly express the content, but uses hints to allow readers to grasp the content hidden in the bottom of the description. *Xiaopinwen* is suitable for (3) expression. It requires color rendering, rich interest, and literary sentiment. Therefore, we can say that *xiaopinwen* is "poetic prose."</p>
<p>Here we want to discuss the *xiaopinwen*'s contribution to most authors and the estimate of its intrinsic value:</p>
<p>First, the value to the author</p>
<p>A. Cultivating skills—To become a skilled writer, one cannot immediately write long articles or masterpieces. Long articles or masterpieces are more burdensome work. *Xiaopinwen* are easy to find material for and convenient to construct. After a considerable period of practice, skills will naturally become flexible.</p>
<p>B. Expanding thinking—Describing a corner of life from daily life, the author's interest is aroused by the writing of real feelings, and literary ideas are like the clear spring in a secluded valley, endlessly flowing.</p>
<p>C. Increasing the ability to savor life—The ability of literature is to express life, and to critique life. *Xiaopinwen* is also an expression and critique of real life. Therefore, to write *xiaopinwen*, one must savor one's own real life and understand the interest of one's own real life, and then one can express life.</p>
<p>D. Cultivating keen observation!—The expression of literature is the deep excavation of life's transverse heart. We should develop a keen ability to see through life or all levels of society and measure our own ideals.</p>
<p>Second, the estimate of intrinsic value</p>
<p>A. Expansion of self-color—This is not necessarily a cold, rigid, and objective record, but another very strong personal tune is being played.</p>
<p>B. Adherence to fleeting moments—When human thoughts and emotions fleetingly appear, grasp them, and do not let this fleeting sweetness escape from our short *xiaopinwen*.</p>
<p>In short, *xiaopinwen* is not a grand article that carries the Tao, nor is it the groaning of the healthy, but a portrayal of the positive or side of all life, society, and the universe. It is a treasure in the palace of skill.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e188">Thinking of the Departure of MacDonald and Herriot <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>When the news of MacDonald's defeat in the British election and Herriot's subsequent loss of the leadership of the Radical Socialist Party in France spread, a satirical cartoon was published in a foreign magazine. The cartoon showed MacDonald stepping down in embarrassment, with Herriot carrying an umbrella, following closely behind MacDonald's ass, walking the same path. After seeing such a cartoon, I naturally found it funny, but at the same time, I could not help but admire the artist's flexible mind. He was able to so ruthlessly ridicule the tragic fate of the two politicians in the British and French political arenas who specialized in selling human heads.</p>
<p>MacDonald was originally the leader of the British Labour Party. He had used the power of a part of British workers to serve as prime minister of the Labour cabinet twice. In general, he could be said to be one of the most active figures on the British political stage. But in 1931, when Britain was in unprecedented financial difficulty, MacDonald, for the sake of the security of British imperialism and to try to overcome the financial difficulties, openly left his own Labour Party and colluded with the Conservative Party, snuggling in Baldwin's arms. In this way, of course, he was to be spurned by his Labour Party and ridiculed by a part of the British people who had still held goodwill towards him. As a result, in this British election, he was severely scolded by the voters and was defeated. Although Baldwin pitied him and gave him a position in the current British cabinet, from now on, the political life of this politician who had once been in the limelight was over. His true colors had been fully revealed, and he would no longer be able to deceive the people he had deceived. His fate was only to serve Baldwin for life, or to be abandoned by the British people in the garbage heap, and from then on, disappear without a trace!</p>
<p>As for Herriot, he was also a very famous figure in France. He was originally the leader of the largest party in France—the Radical Socialist Party; he had served as the Prime Minister of the French Cabinet; since 1905, he had begun to serve as the Mayor of Lyon, and has continued to the present. The French call him "King of Mayors"; this can certainly be said to be the most popular figure on the French political stage in recent years. But during the Laval cabinet, he first violated the will of the Radical Socialist Party and supported Laval's unpopular policies, resulting in opposition from his own party and being forced to resign from the position of party leader. This was a manifestation of the first step he took on the path that MacDonald had taken. Recently, the preliminary results of the French parliamentary election were announced, and Herriot, "contrary to expectations," was defeated. It is said that this is "an unprecedented event in French history." Naturally, his fate in this election will only be fully determined in the second round of voting on May 3, but the failure of this primary election is always a lesson that the French people are continuing to give him, and it is always a manifestation of his political status continuing to decline; even if he is luckily elected in the second round of voting, it is only his last struggle, maintaining his remaining political life. However, according to reports, after the failure of the primary election, Herriot has stated that he "now intends to withdraw from politics and will no longer be a candidate for the second round of elections"; if so, then we can say that Herriot is still able to "recognize the times" and can not continue to cling to power when the people are dissatisfied with him. This is better than MacDonald, who has already failed, begging Baldwin to maintain an official position. However, no matter what, the fate of these two figures is always the same.</p>
<p>The same fate encountered by MacDonald and Herriot has given us two important feelings;</p>
<p>First, MacDonald is essentially a reformist and liberal. Such figures can only ease the current struggles of life and cannot take the road forward at all; under certain circumstances, he may even openly do the dirty work of reversing the car. Therefore, when MacDonald can still continue to play a deceptive and easing role, he can still wear the mask of reform and work hard at peaceful preaching; but now, "he can no longer play such an easing role, and the party members he leads have increasingly left him to take the path they should take. Therefore, for the sake of his personal position, he automatically tore off his mask and openly colluded with the Conservative Party to work hard at the work of reversing the car. At the same time, Herriot is also a conservative, middle-of-the-road liberal. Although the Radical Socialist Party he led in the past has the name "radical," it is actually a middle-class party of French citizens. Because France gained many spoils in the last great war, and society was relatively stable, the middle-of-the-road, moderate, and conservative political views of this middle-class French citizens' party—the Radical Socialist Party—gained the support of most French people, making this party the largest party in France, and the leader of this party, Herriot, also became the most prominent figure in French politics. But recently, because of the development of internal and external crises in France, the struggle between the left and right extremes has become sharp, and the middle-of-the-road Radical Socialist Party has gradually lost power. Herriot, who could not even keep up with the tail of the times, would naturally have to retire in this great era of France, and even combine with the most conservative forces. This is inevitable. According to this analysis, we can think that people like MacDonald and Herriot are the most unreliable: in making friends and in social activities, we should secretly guard against them, lest we be sold by them.</p>
<p>Second, MacDonald was once the leader of the British Labour Party, and Herriot was once the leader of the French Radical Socialist Party. Their past political status was given to them by their party, not created by them personally. Therefore, once they betrayed their party's position and violated their party's will, they also lost their inherent power and status. From this, we can further think that people are social and collective animals. The strength of the individual can only grow and be exerted in the group, and therefore the individual's way out can only be found in the group's way out. Whoever leaves his own group and cannot find a new and better group to join, but only goes his own way or relies on others, will only continue to make his soul degenerate and enter a dead end. MacDonald and Herriot's departure from and violation of their political parties cut off their political lives. Gandhi's withdrawal from the Indian national liberation movement quickly lost his prestige among the Indian people. Gu Ruzhen's and others' treason was cursed by the entire Chinese people. ... There are countless examples of this kind.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Mr. Tang Huaiqiu <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xinqin</p>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to China's new drama movement knows the historical value of the South China Society, right? And Tang Huaiqiu, the leading actor and veteran of drama in the South China Society, is someone that anyone would have to call out "I've admired you for a long time." Recently, the "China Traveling Theater Troupe" led by Tang Huaiqiu has returned from North China with honors. After hearing the news, the reporter made a special trip to No. 13 Yingcun, Supheid Road, to visit this Big Brother Tang.</p>
<p>Arriving at Yingcun, I saw a large number of stage sets piled up under the overpass building in the alley. Following the stage sets, I walked to No. 13 in a roundabout way. From outside the door, I heard the sound of reciting lines inside the door, all in a clear Beijing accent. And suddenly, the wild laughter of a middle-aged man came from far and near to the door. At this time, I happened to push the door open, and he almost bumped into me. As soon as I saw him, I shouted in surprise: "I haven't seen you for a long time! Shop..." He excitedly shook my hand: "Ah! Your news is really well-informed. Three or four people have already come to inquire about the news today. Please come in and sit down!"</p>
