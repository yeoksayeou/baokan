<p>時評</p>
<h3>阿比西尼亞並未滅亡</h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>意大利國王早已官布兼做阿比西尼亞皇帝了。國聯會員國早已解除對意的經濟制裁了。阿比西尼亞這一個國名該漸漸地要從一般人的腦子里消隱下去罷。然而阿比西尼亞黑人繼續不懈的英勇的抗戰精神。却還提醒着世人。「阿比西尼亞並未滅亡」。</p>
<p>這並不是一句什麽誇張的話。下列幾項事實就是顯著的證明。（一）阿京雖告陷落。但阿國仍有政府存在。上月初阿國代表團曾正式通知國聯。聲明阿國新政府已在西部戈爾城成立。並令前北路指揮伊姆魯將軍改編全國陸軍以為繼續抗敵之計。（二）除少數阿奸外。阿國內地之酋長及人民仍在繼續抵抗意軍。他們且已抱定了非將意軍全數驅逐出境戰爭决不終止的决心。（三）所謂已被意軍佔領之束部北部地方。意軍仍時受阿國「遊擊隊」的襲擊。阿京以及哈拉爾台西等地方顯未獲得安定。（上月中旬且有意督在哈拉爾遇害或受重傷的消息。）卽意軍認為業已綏靖完畢的唐拉凱區。也常有阿軍突襲事件發生。（四）意軍對於交通錢始終無法控制。各公路固覺無法淤行。卽所恃為唯一孔道的吉阿鐵道。也時遭阿人威脅。毀路拆軌的事情屢有所聞。</p>
<p>現在阿比西尼亞的抗戰形勢有着大大的開展了。據最近電訊。阿軍曾與意軍大戰。雙方共死七千人。意軍死數千。阿軍已重佔台西。阿京頗有缺乏糧食之虞。又訊。上月二十八日聖喬治紀念節阿人數千曾分三路猛攻首都。並加以包圍。毀意方卡車二千輛。擊落意機一架。同時距阿京約三十哩之摩奇沃意戌軍。為阿部落民衆二千人所攻。有載重汽車編成之意馬達戍兵一縱隊在某處中伏。車悉被毀。並死兵士二百人。又訊。阿將加薩之子率了大軍在查那湖四週與意軍交綏。前駐法阿使哈華利亞特亦率阿兵一縱隊在阿京附近鐵道錢上掘壕駐守。待機而動。前北路指揮伊姆魯將軍則率阿軍四萬人向台西阿京兩處推動。並已招集阿國殘衆。編成六萬人之大軍。這些消息出於不會給失敗的黑人國怎樣宣傳的幾個國際大通信社的傳布。至少有大部分是可信的。</p>
<p>這一切顯示着意帝國主義在阿的統治多麽危殆。意方儘管誇說阿境怎樣「太平無事。」以上種種鐵的事實終究是掩蓋不了的。况且意軍之恢復戰時編制。還可以作為阿人劇烈抗戰的旁證呢。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞人有着那麼堅强的民族意識。那麼奮勇的苦鬥精神。這使我們不但相信着。阿比西尼亞並未滅亡。而且還可以預言。阿比西尼亞是滅亡不了的。波蘭的復興可不是歷史所昭示的前例麼。</p>

<h3>肅軍異動和政變（四）</h3>
<p>— 家禾</p>
<p>究竟寺仙陸相是否用這樣的手段，促速廣田內閣的瓦解，這是後來的事，我們不敢預言，也不必預言。要說的，應該是何以財閥滿意的　垣系人物，會非難廣田內閣？這個問題，要從兩方而去探討。第一是財政的方針，牠留待後日有機會論述預算時去說明。其决，是整個日本資本主義前途的估計，（事實上前者也可以歸併在木項目之下）。現在我們專說後者。</p>
<p>基於明治維新前後的傳統關係，日本現代史，早有了軍部與資產階級對立的記錄。不過，在初期以士族為核心的軍部，對於有產者，如不是保存素來武士輕視町人（商人）的習氣，便是貴族對於新興產業軍主人，為奪爭利益而起的鬥爭，這和「五·一五」後，滲人破產農民以及歿落小有產者成分之荒木大將開始時斯的動作，本質上是不同的。到林銑十郞登台，軍部對於財閥的鬥爭，搖首變質。就是軍部上層的領袖，急速地山縣有朋化與財閥暗中禮上往來。於是，以擴軍及對滿的問題，把財閥自己的鬥爭，發展成軍財內部派別的分歧，再加上軍部領袖之地域，個人，情感，科別等等，把這些派別一天激烈一天地分化起來。促他們分化的主要動力，不在於領袖的主觀意志，而在於外面的經濟勢力，不是「國體明微」的問題，驅使荒木貞夫田中國重（明倫會首領）們與久原房之助石原廣一郞（石原財閥主人）們携手，而是日產石原為瓜分產業的利潤，利用少壯軍人對於資本卞義的厭惡，而把軍部推人政爭的渦流。目前，財閥整個的苦悶，並非估計如何地壓服這些輕舉妄動者，乃躊躇着如何打開自己的困境。儘管太陽　逐日高舉，而「日本製一商品的出路，却一天縮小一天。世界雖大，除這個禮讓的，尊重「萬世一系」歷史的國家－「支那」外，幾乎全用閉門羹的手段，來欵待我們未來的東亞主人。如果沒有効命疆塲的「皇軍」，財閥自己會打開這樣的苦境嗎？自然是不能的。這就表明了軍部的地位，日本有產者，愈受國際經濟不景氣的打擊，愈需要軍部，軍部愈變為可居的奇貨，在政治舞台上的發言也愈有力，結果形成今日尾大不掉的局面。然這不是說，軍部可以離開財閥，沒有財閥的產業，財閥的技術人才，甚至財閥的資本，那失去社會性質的軍部，什麽都束手無策。在財閥心裏，都希望軍部肅軍，不再造成了毫無王法的局面，至於擴張軍備等等，屬於自身的利益，而且在不景氣的今日，尙可以說是拯救自己的手段，自然可以慢慢商量。殊不知稍為滿足了軍部的擴張軍備要求，便扯破國際的條約，於是本屬於日本資本主義自身所需要的擴軍，忽招來了外部的壓力，　造艦在和蘇聯强化遠東軍備的狀况下，迫日本軍部作小孩子與大人競賽的擴軍，這樣的擴軍非日本財政所能負祖，於是財閥的預算合理化，和軍部的對外抗衡木位化，在廣田內閣裏，反映出許多無法解决的矛盾。固然寺內大將是屬於穩健的，但所謂穩健者，不是對於財閥失去了批判或發言的能力，而且「肅軍」的艱苦工作。着着進行之日，沒有擴不的調劑，沒有「庶政一新」的改革，依過去的經騐，會招惹出乎料意之外的禍災，擴軍和庶政一新恩也，肅軍威也，只有恩威並濟，方足克服了現階段三宅坂所感的困難。所以不要說是寺內　一，就是宇垣一成自己吧，也要走上這樣的路。另一方面，「肅軍」的工作，方才開始，荒木系的潛勢力，還不能在最短時間掃淸。這使寺內陸相，非毫無顧慮地得發揮他的手腕。上述兩點，合而造成目前的情勢，這情勢發展下去，也許就是我們有週期性地聽到的「政變」吧。</p>
<p>南次郞繼宇垣就任鮮督，如成為事實；則宇垣的工作，自然是企圖組織內閣。這樣看來，「廣田丸」的擱淺，使人們腦中浮念着那個擁有操舟盛名，但却未曾經下過大海的舟子，那不是毫無理由了。</p>

<h3>阿皇之回憶錄</h3>
<p>巴黎某報曾載阿皇之回憶錄，此回憶錄係阿皇最近在赴英輪决，對法國新聞記者格里奧爾所口授者。</p>
<p>在第一部分，阿皇就各封建主間爭奪政權之時期，作歷史的叙述，在第二部分，阿皇陳述意國對阿比西尼亞之陰謀，其言曰：「最為別緻者一事，即凡對全世界宜告我國不統一者，其人乃經常徒勞無功欲使我國分裂者。惜無餘她以詳述不利我鄰國之事件之全史，然予憶及巴根德拉之管理人，薩奧第吐女皇之娶夫，顧格司酋長之暴動，意人曾對之慫恿。離達波爾　站之遙為哥達爾，——顧格司之居宅所在，——意人有上級勛爵波列爾在。居民曾極尊重波列爾，以其年齒已高，且以其合法娶阿婦為妻，復有極大家庭。波列爾係按阿國習慣而生活，目因此得與人民保持密切聯繫。其開始巧妙宣傳，到處傳說。謂現時國內之執政者為顧格司，惟其一人摯愛其父，且不准歐人大其省境，於「白人文化」之一切均予探討。按其意見，予乃對阿國文化持疏忽態度。顧格司亦會支持意國代辦佛蘭契吉公爵。此人亦會與愛奴保持親切關係。</p>
<p>當顧格司通過决議開始反對吾國之戰爭，克瓦拉一戰彼已被戮。意人二十年之工作，被我軍於二十四小時內使之化為烏有。：另一日予被尊為皇帝，予之加冕禮則於一九三〇年十一月舉行。</p>
<p>愛意奴酋長常與意人相勾結。…一九三二年得到意人之助，他曾帮助其妻兄脫逃，並欲與之聯合以反對我國，此一手段未能成功。帝室軍隊於數日之內巳整頓就緖。外來金錢失效。然意人終不自認為失敗者。一九三一年時，其欲建立領事館之商業參贊，並成立一新領事館於哥沙米都城馬爾哥司。此種參贊之存在無任何根據，蓋任何一意國商人——不論其為白種或黑種，——均不住於此種參贊所在區域。吾人曾容忍之，以證明吾人之博愛，雖吾人深知此種參贊進行政治宣傳，以反對我國之建立。」</p>
<p>其次阿皇陳述一九三四年之著名華爾華爾事件，當時意國邊防軍部侵入阿國邊境達一百二十公里之遙，且拒絕退出此種領土。阿皇續稱：</p>
<p>「吾人有權包圍意軍，並開顯然破壞我國領土事所需採之各種方法。然為實行妥協政策及尊重國聯與對意親簪之條約，吾人未曾出此。吾人欲按國際公法行事……吾人深知所發生者何事，要求吾人不停留於主權問題之討論。吾人甚信本身之正當，故同意避開此一原則問題，而所得仲裁之决議，對雙方均未加以任何責任。此乃吾人之第一失望也。」</p>
<p>阿皇回憶錄之第三部分係專論意阿戰爭之發端。</p>
<p>此一部分中阿皇有言曰：</p>
<p>「未可以歐洲方法進行戰爭。何況我國軍備，不僅砲隊，卽機關槍亦殊可笑。北部軍隊活動於各種地理條件之下，其地每一小節均可作戰爭陣地，其戰術在進行使敵人極感嚴重之游擊戰爭。僅於順利之條件下，方可直接進攻敵人。當敵轉守為攻時，即須退讓。此戰術所追求者有二大目的：愛惜人命之態度、蓋公認陳地戰可消滅大批生命故也。其次，此戰術欲使敵人於雨季以前經常緊張，其時敵人軍備將喪失其大半效能。</p>
<p>「此部軍隊與意人接觸稍晚。予曾命令顧格司酋長軍隊佔領邊境五十公里之地，而令塞姆酋長軍隊佔領距鐵路八十公里之地。予曾深信，對國聯應遵守中立地帶，且實已遵守矣。對阿人解釋此一問題立塲誠非易易。彼等印象中以為此卽第一次之領土退讓。當敵人行動已達嚴重程度時，亦難使阿人相信必須退守。甚至如塞姆酋長此一極有價値之人，亦含淚而退出亞杜華，結果衆人皆知予之企望為何如者，且皆於「肅淸內奸之口號下鬥爭。或許此一過分愼重曾遭失敗。然吾人决不能預知軍備上之軒輊不致引起我國人民之畏懼。……</p>
<p>顧格司之叛變，非對意親善之結果也。蓋此乃叛變之唯一機會，同時第二流軍官方面證明，阿人决不與外人其同進行陰謀。顧格司曾在恐懼之影饗下活動。其木人亦巳估計意國軍備之絕大優勢。經騐之缺乏，巳削弱其對本國軍人剛毅之信仰。重利高爵則已起鞭餘作用。</p>
<p>「意人曾估及其所謂『特利比利』之阿人之叛變。乃謂巴倫姆列爾及哥沙姆二省之阿人意人於特利比亞戰爭中徵選其人為兵士。於十年五載供職意人之後，復遣之回鄉，然事實之經過如此，此種『特利比利』曾受良好訓練及敎育，乃反意之最堅决最優秀之戰士。此種人由意軍服務回來，常表不滿。蓋予以最危險之工作，然不給以預定之獎賞。……關於海納爾事件知者甚衆，不必重述。而南部因意人大舉侵向尼格爾而發生之事件，則知者尙鮮。……此種意人推進，僅因結司達酋長欲攻多羅，並闖入意屬蘇馬里蘭，於相當期間有軍隊一萬五千人至二萬人曾脫離根據地四百公里，係用裝貨汽車以供給其糧食者也。敵人之空軍使結司達酋畏退回，與根據地巳失聯絡，並受敵人轟炸。意國空軍燬減藥物儲藏，使結司達軍隊損失治熱症與疾病之必需藥品，疾病遂於此種區域中傳佈。與根據地之聯絡方奠定時，結司達酋長巳停止退守，而當時敵機乃於交通路上轟炸居民」。</p>
<p>阿皇於其回憶錄第四五兩部分中，歷述意國空軍之活動。其謂因為地勢多半為山陵。故意國飛機飛翔甚高，此亦阿人所射落飛機甚少（十八架）之原因。然因此之故，意國飛機飛翔甚高，使阿人易於自衛。阿皇又稱：</p>
<p>「飛機之來路似甚遼遠。我國佈於一切山峯之瞭望，得一切叢木之助，而對吾國軍隊警吿天空危險，此項活動甚佳。一兩萬人之軍隊隨時隱伏，不着痕跡……當意國飛行員有見及此時，彼輩遂開始轟炸一切樹林掩護之地，然無任何效果。於是意國飛行員受命轟炸各敎堂，彷彿該處隱藏有我國人在。由軍事觀點視之，此乃最殘忍而無目的之行動。婦人，稚子及老者均死於頹垣塌壁之下。每一敎堂均有圖書館，而其中所藏之若干文獻乃古代之唯一佐證，無論在科學上，文學上，以及在藝術上均為寳貴者也……吾不必言裝飾此種敎堂之繪畫矣……例如，鄧邊尼，尤以西爾為甚，該處所失之寳物，無論如何不可恢復矣」。</p>
<p>阿皇又繼續陳述——</p>
<p>「通常用以對付阿人之空軍，未收大效。……故意國總參謀部决定此種武裝於雨季以前使軍事結束。意國之新戰術如下：常用毒瓦斯，而選擇距離陣地較遠之居民為攻襲對象。戰爭開始時意人所用者乃流淚瓦斯彈……阿人立卽適應此點，而於進攻散開。風向之變化使此種瓦斯失去作用。意人此時曾用一種氯質，然極為原始，彼輩將滿盛此種液體之小桶從飛機上擲下。此種小桶中人者甚少。受害者人數有限，傳染區域亦屬有限。……然後意國總參謀部因恐馬加爾之抄擊失敗，且意人巳被逐出西爾，遂决定採用化學戰爭之另一方法，倘無必要之自衛技術，則任何一國亦不能抗拒之。飛機上裝置噴發機……每决飛機九架，十五架，十八架成羣，彼此距離在使每架飛機所噴薄霧能與其他飛機所噴薄霧結成一片大霧，……自一九二六年一月以來，已延用數日不絕。凡中此種氯質小雨點之生物，及飲中毒之水者均患厲疹。惟茅舍或叢林可避免之。凡樹木叢翠之國家，其人不可以手觸物，蓋到處均有死之威脅。凡可掩蔽之處均可發見死屍……此種毒氣立即散佈全國。以前阿人尙謂係與人戰鬥，並相信自己之力量。然至採用阿人認為非人類的工具時，阿人始信與之作戰者乃惡魔耳。」（外論社）</p>

<p>七月三十日、果有匪衆數百名、打偽邊防自衛軍之名號、由察北竄進、攻擾綏遠省陶林縣屬之土木耳台、經該地民團據堡抵抗、互擊數小時、匪衆不支、始向商都方面退去、本月二日、匪衆再度來擾、並參加偽軍恊進、人數由數百增至二千餘人、進攻陶林縣屬之紅根爾圖、與駐紮該地趙承綬部騎兵連衝突、發生激戰、匪攻二日不下、死傷達一二百人、此時趙承綬亦到平地泉、當派彭旅長率騎兵增援該地、同時內蒙正黃旗總管達密凌蘇龍、亦自吿奮勇、率部往助、匪都受創不支、東退數十里、近三日來、綏東情形、尙稱安謐、匪衆亦未再犯、衆信某國此時尙非正式發動、故將來問題難免擴大耳、（七日）</p>

<h3>世運代表團隨征記　（第七信）中央社特派員馮有眞寄</h3>
<p>開羅博物館</p>
<p>八時半嚮導帶我們到了一個古代的王宮、這是十二世紀沙　丁蘇丹Satansaldin的王宮、因為年久失修、且屢次駐兵、有一部份房屋、已經塌地了、這個王宮、建築在一個小山的頂上、居高臨下、可以控制全城、現在為英軍所佔、已改為砲台了、當我們走上山頂的時候、傳來一陣軍號的聲音、把這座古代的王宮、充滿了兇殘的氣燄、</p>
<p>王宮的建築、當然很宏偉、雖屢經兵　、迭遭摧殘、但是除掉已經傾圯的以外、其餘收拾得仍很整潔、嚮導把我們引到王宮的後面、縱目四望、全市一覽無遺、益顯得這座小山形勢之重要、他把開羅的情形、向我大略的做了一個解釋、左面是回敎徒居住的區域、據說回敎的習俗、人死了埋葬在地下以後、就在上面建造房屋、所以開羅可說是活人與死人同住的城市、右面是白人居住的區域、房屋均高大整齊、且絲葉成蔭、風景頗為秀美、尼羅河畔建造了一座很長的引水堤、全市所用的水、都是由這條堤引進來的、堤的下面做成半圓形的闊洞、就好像是一架長橋、殊為壯觀、王宮的右側有一座回敎寺、是十五世紀的遺物、巨大的圓頂、充分表現出荘嚴的神色、在王宮後面飽覽開羅全城的景色後、九點半鐘又匆匆的趕到博物院去、</p>
<p>埃及的博物院建築於一九〇〇年、到現在祗有三十六年、裏面所藏的盡是與埃及文化有關的古物、這些古物、在這所博物院未建築以前、是藏在舊的博物院裏的、新的博物院建築很宏偉、是一所一層的大樓、我們走進去第一個印象、就覺得秩序很好、門口並沒有看見有什麽警察衛士、但是埃及從來沒有發生盜寳或遺失古物的事情、埃及人眞的已經把這些古物看作國粹、看作民族文化的結晶、再也沒有人存着私心、想把牠拿來當作個人的財寳、進去參觀的人都得先買門票、每人五批愛士　Piailre　（約合一先令）從一個鹵輪式的小門依次進去、所有的古物、陳列得都很整齊有序、使參觀的人可以很有系統的去賞鑑、</p>
<p>我們這位嚮導、是一個精通埃及文化史的猶太人、名字呌戈哈巴（Charles　Coldhabar）住在埃及已經三十年了、能通十二國言語、對重要的古物詳詳細細的解釋、滔滔不絕、舌焦唇敝、有時還帶着幽默的口調、引得我們哄然大笑、</p>
<p>博物院裏陳列的古物自埃及有史以前時期起、至最後一個王朝（第三十王朝）止、可謂收集無遺、如果要作一個詳細研究、非要請考古專家費幾年或幾十年時期不可、我們祗一個鐘頭走馬看花的看了一週、當然談不上什麽心得、我現在祗能根據嚮導向我們解釋的最重要的幾件古物、向讀者作一個簡略的介紹、</p>
<p>博物院樓下陳列了許多埃及歷代帝王的石像、各種神像以及帝王的石棺、這些都是幾千年以前的遺物了、雕刻極為精工、可以看出埃及古代藝術之美、不愧為西方文化的鼻祖、</p>
<p>最引起我們注意的、莫過於樓上陳列的特達哈孟　Tutankhamon的金棺與其木乃伊、特達哈孟是埃及的第十八朝王、時為紀元前一千五百五十五年、他的金棺與木乃伊、是英國考古家卡脫博士（Dr　Howard　Carter）得了埃及政府的同意、在他的金字塔裏發掘出來的、時為一九二二年、距今不過十四年而已、當時全球報紙、對發掘的經過與其結果、有許多詳細的文字與照片刋載、可謂轟動一時、據說埃及歷代帝王死的時候、都帶了一個咒語、誰去發掘他地墳墓、誰就不得好死、參加這次發掘的工人、據說都果眞未能善終、而卡脫博士也無緣無故的發了瘋自殺而死、這樣的傳說、是不是穿　附會、記者不是考古家、也無待去考證了、不過他發掘了這座古墓、對埃及文化史有極大的貢獻、是毫無疑義的、特達哈孟之棺槨、是正文的立體形、每層都有一個門、上面裝了暗鎖、金棺的外面、還嵌了許多寳石、雕了許多多花紋、眞是精緻極了、最外面的一層、寬闊各約十五英尺、其餘各層、則一層小似一層、原來是套在裏面的、現在則分開着陳列在大玻璃櫃內、所用的金字、共二百二十五啟羅克蘭姆、其中有一小塊現在發現含有銅質、這個嚮導很幽默的說、也許是當時的工人營私舞弊的、特達哈孟的墳墓、在金字塔中還不算最大的一個、要是把單潑斯或雪弗林墳墓發掘起來、其金棺之偉大、將更為驚人了、</p>
<p>埃及的帝王、是相信永生不死的、所以他死了、以後都用特製的香料敷塗了屍體、可以永不腐爛、唯有心臟無法防腐、死後挖去、而用石製的心臟裝在裏面、這些屍體名呌木乃伊、果然保存了幾千年、仍然完事如生、我想現代的科學家醫藥家對於古代埃及發明這種防腐劑的人、也要自嘆勿如吧、</p>
<p>特達哈孟王的木乃伊、也陳列在博物院裏、不能參觀、這金質的身體、是照着木乃伊的形狀鑄造成的、不但身段手足與木乃伊完全脗合、就是面貌眉目、也與狀無異、栩栩欲生、金身上也用許多名貴的花紋、匠心精巧、雖現代雕刻家的作品、也遠離匹敵、金身共有三層、也是一層套着一層、然後才裝在金棺極侈、於此可見了、</p>
<p>因為相信永生不死的緣故埃及帝王、不但用防腐劑保持他的屍體、並且帶了許多寳物到棺材裏去、在特達哈孟王棺材裏所發掘出來的寳物、都是稀世珍品、多到不可勝數、最有趣的、是古代埃及的人民、他們不但相信帝王生前是他們的主宰、死後是他們的天神、願意終身為他們的帝王服役、並且也相信永生之說、想托了他們帝王的福、隨之永生不死、他們不能建造金字塔、更不能用防腐劑保存他們的屍體、因此異想天開、用石頭雕成他們的模型、附葬在帝王的棺材裏、這些石像、祗有一尺多長、雕琢也很精緻、古代埃及人民之愚蠢思寳、也可見一班了、</p>
<p>除特達哈孟的木乃伊外、博物院裏還陳列了兩具木乃伊、不知是那兩個帝王、這兩具都裝在木壳裏、不但木壳並未腐爛、而且有一具露出五個足趾、與才死的人沒有兩樣、有一個玻璃櫃裏、一排一排的陳列了許多寳石的戒指、約計有一二千枚之多、這些都是歷代帝王所帶的、上面刻着帝王的名字、埃及所有的帝王的戒指、都搜集在裏面、沒有缺少、據嚮導說、誰要把戒指拿走了一枚、就無異把整個埃及文化史撕毀了一頁、但是這些戒指、陳列在玻璃櫃內、是永遠不會缺少的、</p>
<p>另外一個玻璃櫃裏、藏了一把皇后的羽扇、也是三千五百年以前的古物了、羽毛一絲一絲的顯得很淸楚、眞不知他們是用什麽方法保存的、扇柄是橫裝的、用的時候可以把牠轉成一個圓形、享福的方法、她們也可算是想得週到了、</p>
<p>其餘許多珍貴的古物、眞是看不勝看、寫不勝寫、我們迫於時間、於十時半抱了無限的遺憾、離開博物院到開羅的火車站、</p>
<p>蘇彝士河畔的博賽</p>
<p>十一時正我們登上由開羅到博賽的火車、吿別了這可愛的古都、由開羅到博賽約二百餘英里、鐵路公路俱可通達、鐵路是雙軌、須四小時始達、沿途所經、除極小一部份可以種植外、其餘都是一片黃沙、火車疾馳前進的時候、黃沙與煤屑從窗口飛了進來、每個人幾乎都成了尼格羅了、車行約一小時、就與蘇彝士河並行着前進、我們去開羅以前、以為遊了這西方文化發源地的古都、就不能賞鑑這偉大的人造運河、可是結果、魚與熊掌、都兼而有之、快慰之情、無以復加、在蘇彝士河沒有開鏧以前、歐亞交通、非繞道非洲不可、現在蘇彝士河把地中海與紅海溝通了、歐亞間航程、不知縮短了多少、這樣偉大的工程、與我國祗為防禦匈奴保持個人基業的萬里長城、其價値是不可同日而語的、蘇彝士運河於一八五九年由法人雷賽　Ferdinand　Delesseps主持開始開鏧、經過不知多少艱難困苦、歷十年之久、到一八六九年始大功吿成、用欵達二萬萬元之鉅、最初是法國與埃及所共有、後來股票多為英國所收買、現在大權已完全操縱英國之手了、火車與這條大河並行着前進的時候、我們注視着這滿注了碧綠色的海水、一百多碼寬闊的河身、不但驚嘆其工程之偉大、並且覺得牠嫵媚幽靜、在單調的沙漠中、增添了無限可愛的景色、下午三時、車抵博賽、郵船已於一小時前到達了、博賽是屬於埃及的一個城市、地濱地中海、在蘇彝士運河的北端、形勢極為重要、當雷賽開　運河的時候、英國駐埃及的總督賽得MohommedSaid贊助甚力、所以就把這個地方取名賽得港（亦名博賽）以紀念其功績、我們下車後、很多人遊與未衰、分乘汽車遊覽全市、記者因為趕着發信、而郵局又離輪埠甚近、所以先乘汽車艇回到船上、</p>
<p>在記者所到過的地方、其秩序之凌亂嘈雜、人心之刁惡無恥、大槪再也沒有過於博賽的了、記者回到郵船再行登陸的時候、因為公司裏預備的汽艇、未能按時航駛、就與郝更生君同雇一艘營業的汽艇、價錢講得明明白白的兩人共一先令、可是登岸後、船夫一定要每人一個先令、無論你怎樣理論、他總是昧了良心、厚了臉皮、死不承認、最後記者呌他拿國家的人格來担保他不是亂敲竹槓、可是他寗可不顧國家的體面、非要這個先令不可、我們沒有時間、也不値為這件小事同他爭論、結果祗可笑着接受這記竹槓、</p>
<p>據遊覽博賽的人說、無論到什麽地方、總有許多遊手好閒之徒、來呌你到這裏　那裏、買這樣買那樣、甚至死拉活扯、糾纏不淸、大街上有許多土人、公然在兜售淫露、還有許多呌你去看裸體跳舞和春宮電影、大家祗有　謝不　、四時半、大家都乘公司裏的汽艇、離開這齷齪的都市、回到郵船五時半啟　出了蘇彝士河口、向着地中海繼續前進、回頭看着　立在蘇彝士河畔的雷賽大銅像、幻想他當年　這條大河的艱難困苦、不禁轟然起　、</p>

<h3>證券　債市有慢性向下之勢</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、因環境上似有轉變、巿塲人心、因此又起搖動、多方漸漸出前、惟散戶吸收、仍極踴躍、復典公債上塲之謠、愈見濃厚、市價有慢性的向下之勢、昨日經過、開盤卽因太戶傾吐、戊種猛跌六七角、此因隔日未跌之故、甲種紙小二角、乃因隔日跌落已多、漲跌不均、適足以抵於平、次盤散戶吸收最猛、二十一及五十四號買進為多、賣戶則始終為四號·五號·十一及十六號為最多、四十四號川帮亦有出籠、檯面形勢、仍覺不穩、但巿價巳為散戶拉起一角至四角不等、市價結果、大都跌落一角半至六角不等、甲乙兩種之遠期、則尙微好一角及一角半、成交總數、共計六百四十八萬元、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花　日商突來補空　標紗由疲轉挺</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼漲、市態略定、實則連朝在落、形勢一定、獲利者活動抵補、由此反動上昇、但多數心理、因新花將次第登塲、前途看跌、惟標紗較現紗價為低、日商在本月業已抵空、市盤乃由挫轉挺耳、</p>
<p>遠期紗漲元餘</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、承上日之虛風、繼續下降、八月期幾破二百元關口、各月均跌三·四角、拍至一月期、反漲三角、二盤開拍、忽然上昇、形勢轉俏、因日商突來扒空、故本月份較為緊張、漲六角、八·九月期亦漲一元　角、迨至三收盤、仍屬堅昂、某公司亦來補空、結果各月比上日收盤價、均漲六·七·八角至一元二角、查賣出大孚二千四百包、通記六百包、裕大一千四百五十包、大豐一千六百包、明德三千零五十包、泰昌一千包、長豐一千四百包、大昶一千包、恒昌七百包、信誠七百包、買進德大七百五十包、澄記六百五十包、梅記一千一百包、錦昌八百包、合興一千零五十包、賡豐三千三百五十包、愼記一千二百包、益昶一千五百包、潤康三千四百五十包、協成九百包、晉康一千零五十包、半日間最高低收盤價列左　　標　紗最高價　最低價　收盤價　比上日　存賬數</p>

<h3>等候美棉估計發表　棉市都做軋直交易</h3>
<p>棉巿陳花依然疲憊不振、人心虛弱、蓋新棉售價較廉、陳花問津者絕少、市價允挫、遠期因美棉明日政府發表估計、市勢尙平穩、兼以獲利者扒補、同時紗市回好、棉市帶昂云、</p>
<p>標花陳跌新漲</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉呆滯無特色、漲一至四磅音、印度棉亦黯淡無神、跌〇·五羅比、大阪三品花漲三·四角、市塲人心高低不一、惟八月陳花甚萎、蓋以新花情形良好、廠方均抱觀望態度、但拍至新花、以長和生源購進甚鉅、檯面稍緊、各月均漲五分至一角半、二盤後紗市良好、市象安靜、兼之明日估計發表、一般謹愼者軋直過夜、須待明日再次雌雄也、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角半至二角、惟八月跌一角、查賣出吉豐三千擔、火孚五千七百擔、裕大三千七百擔、合興三千六百擔、長餘二千一百擔、益昶二千八百擔、潤康四千七百擔、永昌一千擔、信誠二千擔、買進大豐二千一百擔、明德一千九百擔、元一一千五百擔、恊成一千四百擔、恒昌千七百擔、生源四千三百擔、同和千三百擔、長和五千担、源興昌一千四百担、茲將半日間最高低及收盤價列左、</p>

<h3>美棉收盤時略回堅　三品紗花續漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月由不動至跌三磅音、同業靜候政府報吿、價因歐洲政治情形不佳、多頭了結而軟、賣戶不多、市况狹小、其後奧克拉霍馬天氣乾熱、同業又有限價買進、惟新買戶大缺、收盤時、巿况暗淡而堅、計現貨漲二磅音、期貨漲一至四磅昔、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲四點、印棉先因多頭了結而疲、後因歐洲出口商買進而回、計平果爾及奧姆辣不動、白羅溪跌〇·二五至〇·五羅比、原電錄左、（七日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、八日開盤預測、七八月期白羅溪為二百二十七羅比半、漲一·二五羅比、四五月期白羅溪為二百十六羅比、漲一·二五羅比、十二正月期奧姆辣為一百九十七羅比、漲一·七五羅比、</p>

<h3>新花廠需甚為健旺</h3>
<p>最近兩週以來、十月期標棉由四十五元一角、直錢下降至四十元〇五角、相差四元六角、蓋以美棉種植面積報吿發表後、有一度興奮狀態、未幾轉趨下游、跌破一角二分關口、同時日商估計、我國棉田大增、產量激增、有一千五百萬担外、比上年棉業統計會估計之九百五十九萬六千六百八十四担、激增五百萬担外、有此巨量豐收之消息、人心殊形不安、賣方紛紛活動、新花趨勢甚覺萎靡不振、賣空者叢集、惟今後天氣、有無變化、尙成問題也、查市塲新花拋盤售於中外各廠、單就白包花·通州·太倉花·姚花·火機火、約有二三萬包之譜、足見廠胃之强健、採辦之踴躍矣、茲將新花拋盤最高低價列下、（均係舊秤價）</p>
<h3>疋頭　閩幫已有採辦　棉布市盤暫吿平穩</h3>
<p>昨棉布市情、雖形軟弱、嗣因標紗花跌後回昂、布市暫吿平穩、貨價甚少變動、上月發染洋紗之十磅市布、因時令關係、步落甚猛、現售僅六元六角半、距高峯七元三角半、已跌落七角之鉅、四川幫於上月疊批裝去之藍布·色斜·等貨、因重慶成都主要銷地售盤不振、走銷不旺、故後批添貨尙無動靜、至前决預定之花絨·嗶嘰·直貢·及藍布·色斜·等貨、近日裝運仍極繁忙、粵滇兩地細斜售盤低劣、滬市價雖已降落、仍難相符低檔存貨積厚、而執貨者猶欲扳俏、致走銷益形呆滯、閩帮辦胃略動、昨進藍布·元斜·直貢·畢嘰·細布·細斜·重磅觕斜·輕磅粗布·等貨一百餘件、長江及漢口帮彼本廠花絨·嗶嘰·直貢·及下檔細斜·細布·二百餘件、</p>
<h3>素嗶嘰紛紛上漲</h3>
<p>元藏灰素嗶嘰、邇來市銷大動、客幫續有採購、　勢因之大盛、蓋西貨到存俱缺、東貨所存亦藏、價目遂紛紛升漲矣、昨永與一千號齊售二元六角二分半、伊藤二千五百號嗶幾為二元七角二分半、法商實多嗶嘰、普通悉沽三元二角半、德記舊貨大發財嗶嘰為三元六角、章華國貨九一八、每磚批售　元八角七分五釐云、</p>
<h3>糧食　期粉各月傾跌甚厲　市況純隨洋麥轉移</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、一致呈猛跌之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌七九角不等、坎拿大跌一元一二角左右、當開價時、市塲人心、鑒於洋麥之跌風甚盛、且目下實銷、依然平淡、而業外之興奮、亦不若前之有力、故開價卽較前日跌三四分、各月份之交易、則因雙方之了結甚夥、殊覺暢盛、迨至二盤以後、八九月份、仍然平平、遠期因補空之故、又轉平定、觀目下市況之升沉、純以洋麥報價為轉移、而價已入高昂亦為易跌之反應云、</p>
<h3>洋麥暴落　期開價亦吿鬆　－各月續跌八九分－</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份一致呈暴落之象、因洋麥報價、回落七九角至一元三角、是以市塲人心、大見鬆動、當開價後、各月份卽落四五分、後以粉市亦吿銳跌、人心重虛、喊價步步鬆疲、較之前日、計跌七八九分不等、惟業中人意思、感於產地尙不見鬆、一部分仍思擯守耳、現麥巿面、照標準情形亦非小不可、不過客戶心思、仍然扳住、廠方則欲思抑平、故高貨仍開八角、特高貨則至八角半、中决照降、見交祇二三千包、惟傳日商進意頗貪、持高貨已吃至四允九角、亦覺匪夷所思云、</p>
<h3>東新粳到多價跌</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十七八號、貨共三千四五百石、厚粳市以本街交易不多、價續貶五分、早稻則到銷相仿、市無榮辱、薄稻包胃雖祇威海衛帮辦二百左右、但以高料缺貨、行情提起角許、惟中市者仍見平平、杜洋尖無上落、陰變元定局、東新南市共到三十餘石、以天晴到旺、　低　尺、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來貨十一二號、市上各色去胃白粳羊尖稍有去化、餘貨胃呆、巿價白粳高貨小數分、中次十幾分至近角、羊尖跌一二角、薄稻跌角許、變元埠客尖仍屬平疲、東新粳到貨日旺、去胃不暢、價跌二角、開十元〇八角、</p>
<h3>客秈暢銷市氣復振</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市況、初以到銷兩　、市無榮辱、後因北幫間訊於前、粵　暢辦於後、粵　胃口尙食、全巿成交糙米一千五百包、平軟無神之巿面、又因此活躍、北帮亦有機靖等五百多包去化、本街內地胃口亦活、故行情雖與前市相似、然巿氣甚俏、行情亦已暗提三五分矣、統巿開出江西米一千四百六十九包、湘米四百五十包、沙市糙一千　百包、江北糙三百二十九包、甬米一百四十餘、溫州新機米一百七十包、</p>
<h3>新黃豆供過於求</h3>
<p>昨日新黃豆市況、因買方見來源湧旺、有意　低辦價、故高貨行情反小三四分、刻下大勢轉見供過於求之局、幸銷塲尙屬活絡、故一時暫少過辱、昨計開出城門豆一千五百餘包、江橋豆一千三四百包、珠溪豆五百包、都昌豆五百餘包、鄱陽豆三百包、瑞洪一百包、三陽豆五十三包、柳芳池豆五百包、漢日早黃八十一包、三陽夾書千譜包、都陽夾靑五六百包、漢口粉靑八十七包、去路仍為本街及內地車坊採辦云、</p>
<h3>糖市遠期荷赤拋價略鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖巿公會劃盤、如二四組砂白等、市勢仍軟、現貨二十一元八角半、轉口貨小角、為六元七角、續有成交、現貨東白四號二十一元七角、八號廿一元三角、九號YRO嘜二十一元一角半、轉口貨六元二角、四號六元六角、八號六元四角、本廠綿白振記一號二十元半、二號二十元一角、　號十九元七角、四號十九元三角、五號十八元九角、金心大華一號均二十元半、其餘每檔逐退角、期貨荷赤有昌興號開出九十月份二千包、但行方以步漲過高、暫趨觀望、致乏成交、</p>

<h3>珍眉綠茶一再疲落</h3>
<p>路荘土荘兩路珍眉綠茶、近週以來、銷路非常疲滯、市盤逐步下跌、昨日寳隆永興同孚協和等行、均因國外來電需求、復起開辦、全市成交一千二百餘箱、市價又較前見跌七八元、針眉珠茶等項、略有零星走銷、價亦趨軟、至祁寗紅茶昨市並無大宗交易云、</p>
<p>又據茶棧業公會報吿昨珍眉茶市、依然沉悶不振、除白頭行辦進高中荘二百數十件、價自八十一元至百十二元外、協和同孚保昌各行共祗採辦四百餘件、價與前昨相仿、約跌七八元、鳳睚銷路頗旺、價格亦佳、然到貨不多、至抽珍及針眉兩項、交易甚為淸淡、本週珍眉共約成交四千餘箱、秀眉僅二千六百箱、平水茶尤為淸淡、本週頭珠、共僅售出四百四十箱而已、</p>
<h3>海味蝦尾產價繼續報漲</h3>
<p>新金鈎尾、據港電訊、產價繼續報漲、本市前到之貨、早已售罄、聞悉籎盤號貨、拋過一百十五元、訂購者頗不乏人、舊存冷汽貨、刻亦售升一百十元、且行方尚多不願脫手、以待後之善價、至金山　久少來貨、存底步薄、市勢異常挺俏、</p>
<h3>五金二號鋅皮市貨甚缺貨</h3>
<p>二號鋅皮、現貨早缺、惟最近銷路仍好貨益軋缺、行情飛跳至一百五十二三元、較之前盤高起達十二三元之多、調查目前下存貨、聞祗某鐵行一家、行情尚需提加、據聞洋行到貨、需至九月初旬方有、</p>
<h3>南北貨金菜猛漲白蓮銳跌</h3>
<p>新金針菜、昨據鎭江長途電話來訊、客貨暫守不售、勢甚堅挺、又據徐州電訊、產價又升二元許、此間號盤碭山菜、前盤最低曾達十六元半、昨開十九元、前後升二元半、至於銷方、如泉州臺灣等帮、需要甚殷、惟行盤未能漲足、如粤帮再起動辦、則漲勢更覺有力焉、</p>
<p>蘭谿訊、白蓮出數漸增、產價跌風重起、二三日間竟由四十七八元降至四十關內、猶未穩定、此間行盤、因亦隨鬆、幸存數不多、吃虧尚屬有限、後市如再跌幾許、當可暫定而入正軌矣、</p>

<h3>要立志做大事，勿立志做大官</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>最近在友人家，聽到他的母親對着孩子說：「現在你小學已畢業，要升中學了，用心些，將來你做了大官，則你父母可安樂一世。」</p>
<p>小朋友！靜心地思索一下，是否給父母灌注這腐舊的思想？因為天天灌注腦中，養成做大官的習慣，將來在社會上自以作官為前提，只顧自己。</p>
<p>甚麽呌大事呢？就是說：「無論做那一件事，要有始有終，澈底做成功，便是大事。」從前瓦特發明蒸氣機後，世界工業因之發生大變化，由手工業變為機器工業。當他發明蒸氣機時，見壺蒸汽澎湃，把壺蓋頂開，他因此便同母親，他母親含糊的答，他認為不滿意，從此加以研究，歷二十年之久，才把蒸氣機吿成。柏斯多，專用心力考察普通人們所不能見的東西，這微渺的東西，為一般人目力所不及，但柏斯多把他構造性質，和對於某一種東西的關係，自頭至尾，研究出來，成了一種有系統的結果，就是微生物，因此世界人類才知道要撲滅這種微生物。柏斯多研究這渺小的東西但他能澈底，才得結果，便成了大事；所以瓦特，柏斯多等在歷史上永垂不朽的。</p>
<p>由此可以證明，人在幼時，就應當立定志向，將來自然可以成功。所以我希冀一般小朋友們！先决定自己的志向和自己的人生觀，將來成年，才有益於國家，社會，中國數千年來，有志的人本不少，但是他那種立志做官是腐舊的思想，專注重發達個人，為個人謀幸福。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！時時刻刻記着：要立志做大事，勿立志做大官。</p>
<h3>一個憂國自殺的小朋友</h3>
<p>— 陸國維</p>
<p>小朋友們，我吿訴你們一個悲痛的消息：在浦城地方有一個十四歲的小朋友，姓周名呌自信，平日讀書極用功，時常到圖書館裏去閱讀書報。一校師長同學都很敬重他，最近，我們這位可敬的小朋友因為看見國勢一天危急一天，並且自己國裏還要內戰，悲憤之下就暗暗的找了瓶硝鏹酸吞到肚裏去自殺。後來等到他家人發覺想去醫治，可是已經太晚了，這位可敬可愛的小朋友已脫離這世界，向我們永久吿別。</p>
<p>小朋友們！我們看了這悲壯嚴肅的自殺舉動，除了和這小朋友表同情外，應當作什麽感想？我以為這憂國自殺果然是一種愛國熱忱的表現，並且能驚醒一部份不顧國事醉生夢死的人，但是假使全國的小朋友都因愛國而學他的樣去自殺，那麼將來科誰去負起救國的責任來呢？所以這不是積極合理化的辦法，這是消極不合理的，眞正積極合理化的救國方法是請小朋友們從今日起努力學業，鍜鍊健全的身心，養成互助親愛的精神。預備將來一旦國家需要我們的時候，我們就可本了我們豐富的學識和健全的身體去為國效勞，去救國，去恢復我們祖國的光榮，那時這位憂國自殺的小朋友也要在九泉之下向我們微笑了</p>
<h3>蚊子</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>火一般的太陽把熱烈的光錢直射到地面上來，因此寒暑表上的水銀柱已昇到百度左右了。樹木都垂倒了頭，很懊喪似的，毫無抵抗的讓它蹂躪。人們也搖扇揮汗，不住的喊着熱－蒼蠅蚊子得了活動的好機會，成羣結隊的找尋它們的食物，分頭工作，日間是蒼蠅的工作時間，晚上是蚊子的工作時間。</p>
<p>敏兒的家裏，在晚上，當然也免不了蚊子來襲擊，並且又是成羣結隊，到處可以找到它們的踪跡，因為他家是地處荒僻，池沼中靑草裏，都是製造蚊子的大本營，所以在夏天，受到蚊子的危害，損失倒也不小。敏兒是他家裏頂怕蚊子的一個，因此在晚上乘風凉的時候，常常的拿了一柄蒲扇作為驅除蚊子的利器，他覺得這蚊子眞可惡，總要想一個方法來使它絕跡，於是和他哥哥聰兒來討論這一個問題：「哥哥，我們怎樣可以使蚊子絕跡？」</p>
<p>「這個問題倒很大，絕跡的方法有是有的，像蚊烟香哪，不過這不是根本的方法，我想根本的方法，要殺滅它的卵和幼蟲，那麽蚊子當然不會再發見了。這雖是根本的方法，但要使全國的人民個個能實行才行，因為它是能飛的，不然有什麽用呢？」</p>
<p>「講到了蚊子，我倒想起了一個疑問，就是常常聽得人家說，什麼生瘧疾。這瘧疾病怎麼會發生的？是不是由蚊子傳染的？」</p>
<p>「瘧疾本來是因微生動物中的　蟲，寄生在人的身體裏的赤血球中，而發生這病的。當瘧蚊（是蚊子的一種，是專門傳染瘧疾）吸了這有瘧疾病的人的血液，瘧蟲便隨着血液被它吸到它的胃裏，在它的身體裏經過了很複雜的發育變化。而這瘧蚊再吸別人的血液的時候，瘧蟲就又隨着這瘧蚊的唾液傳染到那個人的身體裏，那人便發生瘧疾了。所以我們時時要注意這瘧蚊來吸我們的血，但我們怎樣能分別出這是瘧蚊，那是普通蚊？普通蚊和瘧蚊是很容易分別：（一）普通蚊的翅膀是透明的，瘧蚊的翅膀是有褐色斑點。（二）普通蚊的頭胸兩部是灰色，腹部是微綠。瘧蚊的全體是黃褐色。（三）普通蚊飛時聲音高·瘧蚊飛時聲音較低。（四）普通蚊的身體較小，　蚊的身體較普通蚊大。（五）普通蚊靜止右壁上時，身體和璧面平行，後肢向上。瘧蚊靜止時，身體和壁面不平行，而後肢稍垂下。（六）普通蚊的脚比身體略長一些，瘧蚊的脚比身體長二倍。（七）普通蚊的卵是橢圓形，常產在汚水中，有二三百粒之多，集成塊狀。瘧蚊的卵細畏，常產在淸水中，只有二十多粒，且不是集成塊狀的。（八）普通蚊的幼蟲孑孑是褐色，呼吸器較長，所以呼吸時從水面向下垂。瘧蚊的孑孑帶綠色，呼吸器較短，所以呼吸時身體和水面是平行的」</p>
<h3>鹿和樵夫</h3>
<p>— 闌刪</p>
<p>有一天，一隻山處正在樹林裏面閒踱着，猛聽見有人騎馬走來的聲音。他們正是獵人，而那隻山鹿正是他們的自的物。</p>
<p>那隻山鹿拚命的逃跑，但無論如何，總聽見這些獵人在它後面追逐着。它已經走了很遠很遠的一段路，而且覺得四雙脚兒都疲倦了。這時候，它可巧的遇見一個樵夫。</p>
<p>它慌忙走到那樵夫面前，帶着求憐的神氣問道：</p>
<p>「樵夫伯伯，我可以躱藏在什麽地方呢！唉！什麼地方我可　得住我的身體呢？」</p>
<p>「走進我的茅屋裏去吧！」那個樵夫指着他自己的房子，答覆它說，「我一定不吿訴他們你是躱在那裏的！」</p>
<p>它於是躱入那茅屋裏去。而那些獵人已經追來了。他們看見這樵夫，便問他剛纔曾吾看見一隻山鹿走過。他並不回答他們，只用手向着那茅屋一指。</p>
<p>但是那山鹿雖然躱在屋裏，它却刻刻留神，看着這樵夫的動作。現在它知道樵夫已經洩漏了消息，便在獵人們尙未走來侵犯它的當兒，急忙的向窗口跳了出去，走了。</p>
<p>獵人們看見鹿已走去，便道：「我們今天讓它去吧！我們不要那雙山鹿了。」說着，便走了回去。</p>
<p>過了幾天，那樵夫遇見了這山鹿，很不滿意的問它道：</p>
<p>「你那天為什麽謝也沒謝我一聲，便走了去啦？」</p>
<p>它答道：「因為你並不誠實，——你是失信了！」</p>
<p>「可是我並沒有吿訴那些獵人你是躱在那裏的呀！」</p>
<p>「好的，」山鹿說，「你雖沒有用你的舌頭和嘴吿訴他們，但是你用你的手去吿訴他們，你的不誠實的壞處，總還是一樣的。——我也不需要像你這樣的朋友了。」說過，它就頭也不回的去了。</p>

<h3>我的暑期生活</h3>
<p>— 鳳惠珍</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快好像流水般的過去一會兒暑期又到了。</p>
<p>但是這假期很長在這一個多月以內我們當然不能整天的談談說說玩玩就算了事的。我以為一定要做些工作才是。我現在把我的暑期生活寫在下面：</p>
<p>（一）每天做假期作業。</p>
<p>（二）補習不及格的功課</p>
<p>（三）健身運動。</p>
<p>（四）　裸外有益的　。</p>
<p>（五）每天做日記。</p>
<p>（六）每天沐浴。</p>
<p>（七）有時同哥妹講故事　笑話。</p>
<p>（八）每天幫助父母操作家事。</p>
<h3>做一隻活動電影機</h3>
<p>— 曹建培</p>
<p>孩子們！這是一個很容易做的科學把戲，如果您們都肯動手試試看，我很願意加入您們的隊伍一齊幹。</p>
<p>找一把剪刀，一根針綫，一塊馬糞紙，（如有其他美麗此的紙榖，那就更好。）把馬糞紙裁成二寸半高，三寸半長。在馬糞紙上，用有顏色的彩筆，一面畫上一隻金魚缸。（如圖一·）另一面畫上一條金魚。（如圖二·）或在白紙上畫好，用漿糊貼到紙板上去。這些手續辦好了以後，再在紙板的兩端，用針鑽一個孔，各繫一條綫上去。（如圖三。）好，我們的電影機做成了，我們的活動電影也就有得看了。</p>
<p>怎樣開法？又怎樣看法呢？</p>
<p>孩子們！我來吿訴您們。我們的活動電影，不像電影院裏那麽大模大樣。什麽賣票員啦，收票員啦，開電影人啦，看客啦。我們自己做放電影的人，同時也就是看客。但我們不收費，也就用不着賣票員和收票員了。用手握牢紙板兩端的綫，用大拇指和食指輪轉道兩根綫，要輪轉快一點。再用眼睛看看紙板怎麽樣？哈哈！金魚是養在金魚缸裏了。</p>
<p>再找一方塊馬糞紙來。一面畫一隻雀兒，另一面畫一隻籠兒，我們再來玩玩看，有趣吧，雀兒是裝在籠裏了。</p>
<p>我們依照上面的做法，可以換許多花樣，如畫一個運動員踢球，小先生敎書，力士射箭。只要您們想得出，都可盡量的畫在紙板上試試看。</p>
<p>孩子們，這是什麼道理呢？其實，這就是活動電影。本來，金魚在紙板的這一面，金魚缸兒在紙板的另一面。因為紙板轉動的速度，把我們眼球弄花了，同時，因為紙板轉動的速度，把兩面畫的影子化成了一個，所以，我們看上去，金魚是養在缸裏了。</p>
<p>假使我們同樣的做四五塊紙板，或幾十個紙板，用連環畫接續的畫下去，我們玩起來，就是等於一幕一慕的電影。</p>
<p>孩子們！眞的活動電影，也就是由許多畫片接續着，用電光反映出來的哩。</p>

<h3>冷沸水</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>星期日明兒從運動塲回來，滿身大汗，正想去取冷水來解渴。他的哥哥智兒見了忙阻止他，並說：冷水不能喝，我這裏有冷沸水拿些去喝吧！」明兒一面喝着冰也似的冷沸水，一面却好生奇怪。暗想：一樣是冷的，為什麽冷水不能吃而和冰一般的冷沸水就可吃了，這是什麽緣故？就去問他哥哥。</p>
<p>「什麽道理嗎？說來話長，我現在只能主要的吿訴你一點。冷水就是生水，因為沒有受到熱力的烹煮，其中的細菌（微生虫）是很多而活動的，我們肉眼雖看不出，但經了顯微鏡一照，就可顯出原形了。據法國大科學家巴斯德說：每一磅冷水，含有細菌二成之多。如果我們把細菌吃到肚裏，就要發生變化，例如：虎烈拉，腹痛，痢疾等都是。所以冷水是不可輕易喝的，冷沸水，因為經過熱的過程，本身已變成熱水了，細菌也被燒死。這冷不過暫時而已，其程度却和沸水無異，所以夏天喝了不但無害，而且還有益呢！</p>
<p>明兒聽聽哥哥這一席話，才知道自己過去的錯誤，於是從今日起，就改過了。</p>
<h3>鼻毛的用處</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>小朋友，鼻子管裏的『鼻毛』，生在裏邊，好似絕沒有什麽用途，有些人閒着，手指升到鼻管裏，拔脫幾根，以為橫豎沒有多犬關係，順便解解寂寞。其實人體上天生的東西，總得有一樣用處，譬如一陣大風，灰塵席捲而來，有了『鼻毛』不是就可以由它『擋』住，不使灰塵鑽到裏邊去麽？平日：我們每天早上洗臉，只要拿手巾在鼻子裏捲個幾捲，嗯！手巾上包你會『黑』得不相信。所以假使沒有那『鼻毛』，一定更不得了！</p>
<p>小朋友，『鼻毛』好似新式屋子上裝的『鐵絲』紗窗，不要把它拔去才是！</p>

<h3>竹筒燒飯</h3>
<p>— ——答日本，橫濱，中華學校，王家聲</p>
<p>家聲弟：你一定是野外生話的「老手」，不然你不會寫出這樣有趣味的信的。不知我們的推測可對嗎？</p>
<p>不錯，我們到野外去，用品越輕便越好。可是我們的炊具却不能不帶一點，否則就會發生恐慌，除非我們食的是乾糧。不過有些旅行家，他們身無長物也可以很滿足地解决了他們的食飯問題的。</p>
<p>你說曉怎樣得用熱石煎蛋，爛泥烤鷄，火灰煨山芋，樹枝烘麵包，可是不曉得可有什麽簡便方法煮飯。這是不能怪你的，雖然你巳經是一個高級童子軍；因為這問題很少有人注意到。</p>
<p>我們這裏却有一個很奇妙的方法吿訴你，就是用竹筒燒飯。</p>
<p>你可以先找一段大竹筒。一端要有竹節當底。然後把洗凈的米倒下去，加上相當的水，再用洗凈了的草把竹筒口塞緊。這樣你的工作算完結了。那麽把它投到火裏去吧，過了些時候，你可以聽到一聲較大的爆裂聲，就是竹筒分裂的時候，那麽你把它拿出來，這時一筒熱騰勝的大米飯已經擺在你的面前了。</p>
<p>說也奇怪，竹筒也可燒飯呵！這是一位旅行全國的童子軍吿訴我們的，說是他經騐中實貴的收穫呢！日本也是一個產竹的地方，希望你能去試試看！</p>
<p>我們童子軍原是隨時利用自然界的一切做我們的奴隸的，望你多多注意這一點，並常常給我們可貴的報吿！　了，祝你成功！</p>

<h3>國王與牧童（三）</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>牧童答道，「它是給我父親看守羊羣的。在我出世以前，他老人家早就養着它了」</p>
<p>小王問道：「你多大年紀」？</p>
<p>「昨天我恰恰十足七歲」？牧童回答着。</p>
<p>小王歡呼起來道：「你也七歲嗎？這就好玩了！昨天我也恰恰十足七歲，」但是誰和你住在一起？他們當然不午你一個人跑出來的，可不是嗎」。</p>
<p>牧童答道：「可是我不得不一個人跑出來，我實在是很願意回到家裏去的」。</p>
<p>小王詫異道：「你喜歡回到家裏去嗎？這眞好玩了！我自己在家裏時，郤一心想望着跑出來；坐在這白銀似的霜上呢！你和這些怪好看的羊在一塊兒玩要。可有多少時候了？它們的鈴子。是多麽的美麗呀！你那根　頭的杖又是從那裏得來的？我很願意也能得到這麽一根。要和你一模一樣的」。</p>
<p>那個時一高個子的人低低的鞠了一躬，挿口說道：「陛下，我們須得回去了。剛才像太傳說，陛下功課要緊，今天只能休息一個鐘點」。</p>
<p>國王蹬着脚叱道！「咄！討厭極了！我可受不了那使人厭倦的功課！我定要留在外面的天日之下。」接着向那牧童問道：「孩子，我問你，你什麼時候回去做功課」？</p>
<p>牧童搖頭道：「我是不做什麽功課的」。</p>
<p>國王很高興的喊了起來道：「怎麽說，你竟不做什麽功評的嗎？咦！你眞是一個幸運的孩子。那麼你在外面要勾留到甚麼時候呢？</p>
<p>牧童答道：「直等到天色黑了才回去。</p>
<p>國王又嘖嘖的說道：「直要等到天黑嗎？咦－咦－咦－咦！多麽的可愛呀！我在晚是從來不出來的，我很歡喜看那星斗在天空中出現。你可曾見過一顆亮晶晶的星刺破了黑暗而鑽出來嗎？咦！但是你的衣服在那裏」？</p>
<p>牧童忙道：「我是沒有什麼衣服的」。</p>
<p>國王很詫異的說道：「那麼你只把那一頭死裏羊在身上，就算了嗎？這一定是非常舒服的。我的衣服又熱又重」。</p>

<h3>怎樣滿足你的口福？</h3>
<p>— 曹幼民</p>
<p>說起口福，人人都能够想起一句古話：「飲食男女，人之大欲存焉！」所以，如果為了滿足口福，而費點心力時間在飲食的研究上，或者是同好所樂聞吧？但要請大家注意的是：本文不是介紹你往甚麽地方去購買甚麽吃的喝的，而是吿訴你如何在一個需要你自己動手的塲合中，由你自己親手弄給你自己享用。在有些時候，比如是單身在外作客，而又不慣吃他鄉口味；同樣的魚肉菜蔬竟會樣樣都不能下咽。自己又不能親手弄來吃，甚至速如何吩咐廚子變個樣兒也不會。想來這種苦况，無論男女，是難免不遇到的。</p>
<p>大凡旅居在他鄉稍久的人，如果他的業餘還有空暇時間，則對於烹調方法的硏討也可算得是「一樂也」吧？</p>
<p>若從烹調方法的橫的方面——卽是種類方面來講，原則上不外是：「蒸」，「灸」，費時，灸，拌，七個字。但因為「蒸」，「灸」，費時，火候也不容易捉摸，所以通常的烹調决跳不出燒、，煮，煎，炒，拌的範圍。這五項之中，以「拌」為最容易。拌又分凉拌，熱拌兩秘。京拌的東西，說起來，差不多人人都會，比如「拌海蜇」，「拌黃瓜」，「拌豆腐」等。熱拌一項，在江浙不多見，在雲貴川則常有。熱拌似乎是炒，但為不使菜肴過於爛熟起見，往往用油煎，調和原料如醬，醋，辣椒等，於沸熱時由鍋中傾於置菜蔬之碗中，立卽用筷拌攪使熟。如川黔滇菜中之泡黃瓜，油嗆白菜，油泡肚等都是，京菜中亦有。油煎和油爆差不多，但它和「炒與「燒」都有連帶關係。比如烹調魚類，除淸蒸而外，是必須先從煎入手的。在習慣上，江浙等省多半煎一面黃，卽和上五味汁紅燒（西湖酷魚的燒法簡直不用煎，把鮮魚剝鱗去臟腑洗凈後，擺在開水裏一燙，便加調和汁。故食時極嫩而鮮。）再朝西如湘鄂等省則必須兩面煎黃，川滇等處則吃煎得極透的脆皮魚。至於鹹魚，則無論何處都覺以油煎之味為最美。大凡煎菜，必須讓油（多半用猪油，但牛油，鵝油，麻油，菜油，亦可用）在鍋裏熬得極沸（如果撒一點兒鹽末下鍋，聽見大聲響亮，便是極沸），那時，再把魚肉類放進鍋去。其實，「炒和「燒」的初步也是同樣。「煎」，這一項，考究些的多用平底鍋。（目下平底鍋很通行，是為了歐化傾向，每見小家庭中常弄弄炸桂魚，煎牛排，火腿蛋等。）灸，和烤沒有甚麽大分別，就是甩鐵又或夾子，鐵筷等把肉類直接在火裏灸，如烤鴨，灸肉，燒皮肉，又燒等等。「灸」之外還有一種類似的「燻」，如燻魚，燻鷄等，事先也必須經過煎的手續，但是要把調味汁預先抺在魚或鷄的表皮全部，煎的時候很少，（油用得少，使其不致粘鍋便可。）取出後，在鍋中放上茴香八角等香料與已泡過的乾茶葉，再把魚，鷄用特製鐵架，（毛竹筷子交叉着也行。）擔在香料上，用文火（小火）燒鍋，使香料的烟往上燻。</p>
<p>上海人口頭禪總呌「燒」小菜，所以「燒」在上海極為通行；也同蘇州人的動不動便是「擺拉浪飯鑊子（鍋）浪蒸蒸」相像。這「燒」，在中國西南部呌作水炒，表示是少用油，多用水帮忙之意。如炒百葉肉絲，膾三鮮，蠔油豆腐，燜羅葡肉片等一類的菜，那是與炒不同的，允其是川滇等地所喜食的乾炒，焦炒，那又差不多成了煎了。「炒」在烹調中同「燒」二樣的容易。所謂「水炒」的「燒」其實也不能少用油，不過在調和五味汁時可加上相當的水分在內罷了。但戲法人人會變，各有巧妙不同。就單以通常人人每天都在吃的炒肉絲一項來說，仔細一想，誰個也會感到有趣，而嘆炒肉絲花樣之奇觀的吧？我乘此還可以介紹一個炒肉絲的幽默故事，以博大家一笑。</p>
<p>這故事是從遜淸時傳說下來的，叙述閩南一個窮秀才，在三藩之一的耿精忠失敗後，得娶到耿府遣散的廚孃一名為妻，談起耿藩每天所吃的山珍海味，異樣烹調，使秀才饞涎欲滴。便要求他妻子弄兩樣好菜來一飽他的口福。他的妻子說：我在耿府只管一樣菜，就是專門「炒肉絲」，其他並不會。但這炒肉絲必須在個整豬的身上，割取豬的一條裏脊肉才能用。秀才敬謹如命，好容易等到孔夫子　誕那天分胙肉時候，向學宮同人千懇萬求，才弄到一條裏脊肉回家交給妻子，她便切好配好五味汁炒了一碗肉絲，果然香味撲鼻。這時，秀才想喝酒了，他妻子便出門去替他沽酒。誰想到等她回來，秀才竟倒臥在廚房裏，一碗肉絲也吃得乾乾凈凈了。她把他扶起來問做什麽？秀才嘴裏糊糊塗塗不淸不楚地答應她，好容易才聽出他的意思。原來秀才被那炒肉絲的香味弄得迫不及待，便獨自個大嚼起來。等到碗裏吃完，嘴裏嚼完，竟違自己的舌頭也嚼爛一節吃下去而不自知，所以便痛倒在地了了！</p>
<p>再說烹調方法的縱的方面——卽是由生菜到熟肴的過程。最初是砧板工作，這一工作是有危險性的，如果不得法，右手裏執的大菜刀，是會如同嚼舌秀才一樣，你要切下自己的指頭來的。肉此，在你自己或呌人去買魚肉菜蔬時，可以預先吿訴賣菜的代你切好，不論肉絲，魚塊都可。其决便是配五味汁了，配的時候，自己可以先嘗一嘗，另外用一個小碗放在鍋旁，以免臨時不知如何調味之苦。再次便是用點團粉揉一揉肉片肉絲等，如煎魚則可調在五味汁內。鍋外準備好，便開始鍋內工作。放油，煉油，撒鹽入油鍋，候油沸下菜入油鍋。如果油很沸，那下去的魚肉菜蔬，翻兩翻是必然熟的，（你用不着怕它不熟，以致燒得老而無味。）便用勺子剷出來放進碗裏；然後再把五味汁另行下鍋一煎。然後，隨便你再把魚肉菜蔬回一次鍋和五味汁在一起汆一陣炒一陣亦可，單把五味汁澆在擺魚肉菜蔬的碗裏熱拌亦可。總之，你總分得出那些是很容易熟的，那些是不容易熟的，而分別它們的火候。</p>
<p>天生給人一個鼻子和一個舌頭，都是極靈巧的東西，一聞一嘗，便會見機而作，因勢利導。所以，我以為滿足口福並非難事。如果你熟能生巧的話，你便會弄出些花樣來。這裏頭的「色香味　法」是缺一不可的！</p>
<p>火色，菜色，五味汁色，（有很多人不用黑醬油而常用鹽汁，使菜色不黑。）碗益色。精於烹飪的人，喫菜的確是講究「色」的，拿上桌一看，菜肴的顏色一好，香味俱備，則　口舌，自然配胃口，飽食欲了。而且，烹調法和刀法也有密切關係。否則，門槓似的肉絲，石蛋似的鷄丁，亂刀斬的菜蔬等做原料，你就是再弄得入味，但總是面目可　的！</p>
<p>刀法，也不是難事，越鋒利的切菜刀越得用。刀要採取大而鋒薄背厚的。不論切肉絲，肉丁，肉片，肉末，總要先把一塊生肉，先片削了皮；再把肥和瘦片削而分開。（如果燒紅燒肉等，則例應用五花肉，連肥瘦皮一道切　不在此例。）右手操刀，左手撫方塊肉的上方，橫下刀來，一大片一大片的從右到左削開來，（並用不着就分開）然後再用刀從上往下切。（這時，可以三片五片分開來罍着切，較大塊為容易切些。）先成一條條大肉絲，再把它介開來切。並把肥同瘦分成兩處擺在碗內。（如炒肉絲，肥的先下鍋，瘦的後下鍋，因為肥的有脂肪油可榨，且焦點易於入口。）如切允魚腰子，肚子，肫肝等，大片工作相同，到小片時便要在小片上起花，（用刀在小片上　綱形紋，方塊紋均可。）一下鍋自然會捲成花狀的。</p>
<p>現在，我們再來補充個做一川湯」的方法。川湯，並非單指四川而言；不過這種方法以　為最通行罷了。通常，誰都知道肉片湯，但往往苦於湯又鹹又渾而肉片總是老。川湯的特點便是着眼於淡而鮮，淸而味濃，肉片嫩而可口。加入之香菌片，搾菜片，絲瓜片，豌豆尖等，顏色鮮艷靑翠悅人。其烹調法，通常不用有色的醬油，僅用鹽汁及團粉揉於肉片巾，另置一小碗內；再切香菌，榨菜（須洗過切片），絲瓜片或豌豆尖等另置一旁。鍋中燒水至將沸時，先把榨菜，香菌，絲瓜片放下去，候它煮沸，再入肉片，入肉片須盛以有眼湯勺，使其在湯中漂約一二分鐘，一熟卽舀出置大碗內，然後把湯舀至碗內，（如果在有豌豆菜之季，豆尖亦要如同肉片之　法，不能下鍋。）乘熱，再撒鹽少許，胡椒少許。端到桌上，不特顏色好看，味道也十分可口。自然座上的人要「一見川湯，吃過精光」了。</p>
<p>國際情報</p>
<h3>各國金生產現狀</h3>
<p>— 時</p>
<p>黃金是資本主義世界的主要流通物；現今世界雖有大多數國家已放棄了金本位，但黃金在資本主義世界中的重要性和作用却並未因之减少。我們可以在一個國家的金保有的多寡及余的流動情况中看出它國內的情勢，同樣，也可以在世界黃金供給的情報中看出國際的一般情勢。現在要報吿的便是最近世界黃金供給的情况。</p>
<p>先拿黃余的生產來說，在上次世界大戰後就有　　的减少；在這中問產額收低的是一</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>九二二年，那時世界黃金的總產額是一千五百四十萬盎斯。此後的生產又顯示出了增加的情勢，及至一九三〇年時，世界黃金的生產就增到一千六百萬盎斯至二千萬盎斯了。但這生產的增加是不平衡的，不一致的，如這時南阿的蘭德金鑛生產是有顯著的增加，蘇聯和加拿大的也增加了些許，但美國和澳洲的生產却是减少了。</p>
<p>一九三〇年以後，由於空前的大恐慌之發展，物價的低落，英美等國的相繼貶低幣値，金價的昂貴，金生產是受到了很大的刺激。在這個刺激之下，使金生產的利潤大為增加，因而更繼續招來了對金鑛的新的投資，促進了舊鑛的擴張和新鑛的開發。首先，如美國西部在過去所放棄的金鑛，這時又再開了，新金鑛的開發已發展到了東南部。其决是加拿大，它在這時採金的地域已達到了遠遠的北極圈附近；在那些地方，金鑛的所有者們都利用最新的採金法和飛機來採取並運載黃金。同時，澳洲，新西蘭及智利等地的舊鑛也再開了，舊有的金鑛工人已繼續工作了，金的生產當然又恢復了舊觀</p>
<p>在世界黃金生產增加中，値得特別注意的是蘇聯和南阿，前者的金生產居世界第一位，後者則居世界第一位。</p>
<p>先說蘇聯。在最近數年間，蘇聯在金鑛業中工作的，增加到了七十萬人。他們使用最新式的浚泥機，以代替從來用手洗的方法，這結果是大大地增加了西伯利亞的金生產。他們的金鑛都是機械化了的，在利用最新的機械下，使最近烏拉爾金鑛的生產更是大為增加。這些黃金，大部分都山蘇聯政府運輸出來，購買機器及其他所需要的物品，以努力從事於他們國內的建設。</p>
<p>至於南阿聯邦，它當然是在英國支配之下的，因之它的黃金生產不僅與它自身有關係，而且還關係到了英國。首先是隨着英國的停止金本　，在一九三二年十二月南阿金鎊也跌價了，由是金的價格差不多要高漲一倍。這結果當然要　進南阿金生產的增加，據目前情勢的估計，大概南阿的金生產可增至一千五百萬盎斯。</p>
<p>由於金價的高漲，金生產的增加，南阿的財政當然也呈現出好况的現象。最近數年來，它的國庫都存巨額的餘剩。　詩在輸入方面也有　明的增加　　　　　　　　　　　　三二年是三千二百萬鎊，但在去年便增加到七千五百萬鎊了；三年之間竟增加了一倍以上。這些事實所表示的是什麼呢？一句話說完，那是表示的英帝國主義對於南阿人民剝削的加緊，對於南阿黃金掠奪的積極。</p>
<p>現在，我們還可以引出如下的數字來，以更具體地顯示最近世界各主要產金地的生產概况——</p>
<p>最近世界的金生產（單位百萬舊美元）</p>
<p>由此可見：最近數年來世界金生產是在一般的增加；就中蘇聯和加拿大的增加情勢允其顯明。至於本年度的金生產，當然還沒有整個的統計數字，但就過去幾月的情形看來，却是還在繼續增加的。據調查，本年一月－二月的世界金生產為五百二十萬盎斯，比去年同期約增加了八十萬盎斯，就中南阿聯邦，加拿大及美國的生產比去年同期要多十萬盎斯。同時，居世界第二位的蘇聯最近更發表了金增產計劃，依據這個計劃，本年度蘇聯將生產黃金一千萬盎斯以上；這比較起去年的來，的增加了二倍多。這樣，現在就可想到的，是本年世界黃金生產的增加必要顯示出更新的記錄；據一般估計，大概本年的金生產可達三千三百萬乃至三千五百萬盎斯以上。但是，這里値得注意的，是如果這個估計成為事實，同時蘇聯的那個計劃又被實現時，那便是蘇聯的金生產將要佔世界的三分之一；而蘇聯的金生產增加的速度，比較起資本主義世界的來，也會顯示得更高了。</p>
<p>以上只是金生產增加的情形，這種情形只是世界金供給增加的一面。同時，在另一方面，由於金生產的增加，原來退藏的黃金也繼續放出，因之世界黃金的供給便更多了。在這中間値得特別注意的，是在大恐慌之前，印度及其他東洋諸國是傳統的金退藏國，那時它們每年約要吸收世界金生產的三分之二：然而在恐慌後，印度等却成了黃金的賣出者。例如印度，在最近四年間就巳輸出了的一億八千萬鎊（九億美元）的黃金；如果再將由中國及英領馬來等地流出的黃金加上，那由遠東方面放出的退藏金，其總額當在十億鎊以上</p>
<p>然而，這樣大量的金生產與再放出的退藏金父流到什麽地方去了呢？第一是在帝國主　的金爭奪戰中，美法等國獲得了大　的儲金；第二是由於世界危機之發展，歐洲各國的富翁都努力在國內外購買黃金來儲存，這也吸收了大量的現金。如在去年，世界金供給總額的十二億美元，各國中央銀行的通貨用金及工藝的費用約增加七億美元，此外的五億美元的黃金便為個人所吸收了；這些個人主要的當然是歐美的富翁。據調查，本年來私人收藏黃金的情勢還在發展，到現在為止，被收藏的黃金恐怕已有十億美元之多了。</p>
<p>金供給的增加本可以促進物價的高漲，但在事實上物價却並未如所期望那樣地上昇。道是因為各國金本位都未恢復，它們正在用匯兌戰的方法來壓低物價，以便傾銷；而已有的黃金却並未拿出來流通，它與本位貨早已宣吿分離了。至於在金供給增加中，各國尙不停止黃金的爭奪戰，私人還在收藏黃金，那當然是戰爭危機的表現。</p>
<h3>僞國工人的工資</h3>
<p>— 柏譯</p>
<p>在「滿洲國」的工人，大別之可分為華人，日人和韓人三種，其中華人要佔全數百分之九十五以上。根據南滿洲鐵道公司的統計，該公司的修理工廠所雇用的華工，其所得的工資僅等於同廠的日本工人所得的四分之一。此外，在「滿洲國」其他一切工廠巾，彼此的情形也都差不多。</p>
<p>近年來因為社會的不景氣，在「滿洲國」，無論是中國工人或日本工人，工資都一般地减低子，但中國工人的工資被减低得更多。例如，從一九二八年四月至一九三三年二月這一時期中，撫順媒鑛的華工，工資减低了百分之一一·三，而同時日本工人的工資則僅减低百分之七·八而已。</p>
<p>至於在「滿洲國」的中國農業工人，他們的工資更是被大火地减低了－的計减低了一半。</p>
<p>此外也有完全拿不到工資，或甚至根本不發給工資的，不必說，他們的生活是比其他的工人　　　了。</p>

<p>假如初次使用的時候覺得稍微有些兒痛，可不必驚慌，那是不妨事的。皮膚敏戚的人，在使用這液劑之前，先在臉上及頸部拍上冷膏是很相宜的，並且使用時不要只是塗上了就算數，而必須用雙手的兩隻指頭蘸了牠輕輕的拍上臉龐及頸上。還有一點也必須注意，卽是不可光拍口喉部，必須連頸背也同時拍到，因為頸背較之喉部更重要，更明顯的緣故。（完）</p>
<p>生活</p>
<h3>巫師</h3>
<p>— 張顯廷</p>
<p>我們是全靠着鬼神和死人的靈魂才能生活的，雖然世上眞地有無鬼神和靈魂，我眞到現在還不能肯定地答復。但是，至少是要有人信仰鬼神才行。也許在外國，在通都大邑，在文明的所在，幹我們這種生活的人是很少的吧？可是在我們這落後的卑鄙的農村社會裏，我們這種求神問卜，降魔伏鬼，超度亡魂的職業，還含　莫大的作用。在鬼神支配着人世的一半的封建社會中，正需要着我們這一類的人。</p>
<p>在別的地方，我們的名字也許各有不同，但在我們這兒，便呌做「端公」「道師」，就是巫師之意，我們端公道師的工作，除了兼帶着做一些喜慶燕賀，如結婚，祝壽等之樂師而外，主要的職務是在收鬼，超度，求神。自然，也有些端公兼習舊戲，在本鄕的「廟會」，「神會」，「節期」，或人家的「紅白憂喜」的時候，唱一唱戲，也有些道師兼習「陰陽」，為死者看地理，但這些都不是我們這行職業的主要工作。</p>
<p>要求得我們這行主活，當然也不是容易的事。記得我在十歲稍識字時，便開始準備了。起首還未拜投師父之先，就要在自己家裏把應讀的初步的經書讀過，如「地藏經」，如「解寃經」，如「血盆經」，都是十歲左右讀過的。投師時，我已是十二歲了。做端公，同做醫生差不多，是一行文雅的職業，肚裏是需得少許文墨的。不僅要唸得來許多斷斷續續的經文，而且要懂得那上達玉皇大帝的公文程式，要知道討滅邪魔妖怪的檄文，同時要能寫黃榜的榜文，甚至要為孝家做祭文，為主人寫各種喜對，壽對，孝對，要為人家寫紅白帖子，請客單，訃丈等等。在我看來，我們的才學，一般總要比醫生所具備的複雜些。自然，我們在鄉裏人的眼中，在酬報上，都比醫生為佳，這是不用說的。在師父家中，我又讀過了二年的經書。在這三年中，除了跟着老師到人家去「做道塲」，「打小送」，「慶壇」等而外，便在家裏學寫呈文，黃榜。在平時，有三分之二的時間是跟先生到外面去做生活的，在家學習時間很少，所以許多的符咒，卦法，以及各種謳唱，道法，都是在演習中學得來的。而且這也不是先生親自傳授給我，而是看着先生那樣表演，自己去模倣來的。到了第三年，謝了先生的師禮，又做了一回慶祝，才算出了師。</p>
<p>人家有了疾病，我們便有了生意。鄕民都以為疾病之來是鬼神在作怪，不是前世的寃孽，便是觸犯了上火，需要我們去做送鬼消災解冤的工作。這就呌做「打小送」，又名「打鑼」，就是送鬼之意。「打鑼」是共請了十幾個端公，打着大鑼大鼓，在病人家裏大鬧塲。用桃符令箭（用桃樹枝製成假的弓箭）在病人的門上帳子上亂射，用各種符繪貼在房門上，鬼怪便不敢再進去了。又用人　着鬼妖，再裝着神兵去射殺降伏。在未做這些之先，要把病人的生庚八字寫在文書上焚報天庭，再從卜卦的陰陽中淸查病人究患何病，究犯何煞，再定送的方法。打鑼這項事是從下午　時起直要鬧到次作法。又為病人做一架稻稈做的船，用紙燭焚化，呌做「送船」，意思是把鬼魂遣送去了。又用一碗冷飯和些水，隨着紙燭，在屋宅邊的空中撤去，這就是「賞水飯」，讓鬼魂去吃。總之，對於鬼魂是想用剛柔兩種法子來對付。一種是捉拿驅除，一種是收買恭送。這是要看犯了甚麽鬼來定的。發財的人家大半打鑼捉鬼，而貧窮的人家則多半「打小送」送鬼。也許是發財人有勢力，鬼害怕他；而貧窮人沒錢，鬼欺負他吧？</p>
<p>打小送也是要半夜過了才回去。我們照規則是不能在主人家裏寄宿的，不怕時間是如何的晚，不怕路程是如何的遠，不怕天氣是如何的壞，你都得回家去歇。在那嚴冬落雪的天氣，夜裏到下半夜的時候，我們每每是一個人打着一個小小燈光的燈籠，在那山野中要行到二三十里的路程的。在路途中身體是再疲乏不過的了，整天的口唱手做脚走的工作，整天的香煙紙灰油氣的呼吸，你的頭早已暈了，還要迷迷糊糊地踏着雪，冒着風雨來走這黑暗中寂寞中崎嶇的山徑。自然我們是收鬼送鬼的人，一天都在吃鬼飯，但是到了這曠野無人的高山上，到了這墳墓堆積的山　裏，你能不心驚膽寒，怕魔鬼來陷害你，報復你嗎？</p>
<p>鄕裏每一家都供有壇神菩薩，壇神是專管牛馬六畜的生死疾病的。農夫們一年到頭的希望，除了「五榖豐登」，便是「六畜興旺」。所以每年對於統治六畜的壇神有一番「小慶」，每三年有一番「大慶」。小慶只需請二三個端公。大慶則需十幾個端公。也是從下午二時起到第二天天亮。慶壇完全是一種慶祝，還要夾一些不倫不類的戲劇，歌唱。慶壇時必定要殺一頭猪，滿身挿着香燭，供在壇神之前。我們頂喜歡慶壇這生意，一方面是工作輕鬆快活，一方面是報酬豐富，除了一斗二斗香米，一隻三隻鷄鴨之外，你每人可以凈得銅元十餘千。但是也有一件最慘酷的事情；就是要點血，要端公用殺猪的那把銳利的刀尖去戳自己的腦頂，戳出血來滴在酒杯中，和着酒洒在牛欄裏，猪圈裏，這樣，六畜便不會染着瘟疫，便會長得「齊頭齊尾」了。這點血的手續大半是要學徒去做，師父們雖拿着豐富的香米利食，但不願流血的。在未點血之先，要把頭上的髮剃去一塊，先用火熱的紙灰烘一烘腦頂，再飲幾杯熱酒，在壇神面前叩首頂禮，口裏默念着咒語，才用刀尖去戳頭頂。在從未點過血的我，初次聽着師父的安慰，說心裏虔敬便一點兒都不疼時，尙不大害怕。但是到了二次三次，幾乎隔一個月又來一次時，便感到非常惶恐了，不怕如何禱吿，如何眞誠，但刀戳在腦頂都是痛不可當的。手拿着刀子不住地戰慄，但為了得錢，為了師父命令，這是不能不去犧牲的。我們做端公約人就怕這種「開刀」點血的工作。</p>
<p>我們還有的職務便是做「道塲」。有些為廟會去超度過往的遊方亡魂，做「水陸道塲」，「念黃經」，「打淸　」，但大部分是為某家的死者「做功德」。死者剛剛落氣時，端公便手執「引路幡」在死者的頭前唱引，這呌做「開路」，為死者引路到陰間去。開路過後便是「唸經」，「送喪」等等。若是死者是女子，便要「破獄」，把地獄打開，將死者從地獄中救出來，這是模仿目蓮救母的故事，女人一定是罪孼深重，定要被打人「阿鼻地獄」的。</p>
<p>我們這種生活，一般是很苦的，夜間怕鬼打擾，睡不成覺，又要「開刀」。但是遇着那賢惠的主人，他們的欺待却很豐厚，每天有三數次的酒食，茶點，臨行時有香米利食，過後在街塲上相遇時還招呼你吃茶喝酒，也相當地受人尊敬。不過，如果你正在替人家「打小送」，而死者恰好於這時一命嗚呼，那病家便要對你不住了，認為你道法不高，不能退邪，便馬上趕你出去，報酬自然也收不到手了。現在鄕間更加竊困了，打小送的自然有，打鑼的人家却少了；小慶的還有，大慶的都少了；有些人死了只開一開路就完了，很少做道塲的，甚至因死得太多，路都不開的也有。因此我們的生意也就漸漸　不　　。</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Has Not Yet Received Li Bai's Reply Telegram; News from Guangxi is Currently Very Quiet; Telegrams to Lingshan and Other Counties in Guangdong are Cut Off; Rumor that Guangxi Troops Occupied Beihai is Untrue</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Bai still has no intention of leaving Guangxi. The Central Government still favors leniency towards Guangxi, waiting for Li Bai to repent. Guangxi natives Huang Quan and others are working hard to mediate. Key figures in the Guangdong military and government have jointly sent a letter advising Li Bai to leave Guangxi and go north to take office. This letter was handed to Xiang Hanping and Deng Shizeng, who flew to Yong on the morning of the 8th at 8:00 AM to personally deliver it to Li Bai, mediating for peace. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jiujiang) According to the Kuling telephone, as of the 8th, Li Bai had not yet replied to Chairman Chiang's telegram sent to Li Bai. Very little news has been received from Guangxi in recent days, so it is very quiet. Currently, people's organizations from all over the country, as well as military and civilian officials from various provinces, are sending telegrams to Li, advising him to take up his new post, hoping that Li Bai will realize the situation and complete the great plan of unification and national salvation. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Beihai dispatch from the 5th, the rumor that Guangxi troops occupied Nankang and entered Lianzhou is untrue. Although Guangxi troops have the intention of spying on Qinlian, it is not yet known where they have reached due to inconvenient transportation. Magistrate Wang Renzi of Hepu County took his family from here by boat to Hong Kong on the 4th, hence the rumors are rampant. However, it is recognized that Wang was summoned to the provincial capital and will return to Lian after a week. Several hundred special service team members of the Finance Department are still stationed here, sealing up more than ten prepared sailing ships to go elsewhere. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Li Bai ordered the requisition of grain stored by the people and sold exclusively by the government, causing widespread panic among the people. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) In recent days, Guangxi troops under Tan Lianfang have been increasing defenses in Wuzhou, and fortifications are being hastily built on strategic mountain positions near Wuzhou. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Telegrams to Fangcheng, Hepu, Lingshan and other counties under the jurisdiction of Qinlian were cut off on the 8th, and the reason is unknown. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong's Five Military Districts Determine Garrison Areas</h3>

<h3>Gu Zhutong and Others Send Telegrams Urging Li Bai to Go North</h3>
<p>Guiyang: Gu Zhutong and others sent a telegram to Li Bai on the 7th, stating briefly: "Reading the newspaper reports of your two brothers' telegrams to Chairman Chiang, we are delighted to learn of your deep understanding of the Central Government's painstaking efforts. Differing opinions have converged. The good news is cause for great joy. As for the great plan of resisting aggression and saving the nation, the Central Government has already made a decision. Zhejiang Province is located on the coast of the East China Sea and is at the forefront of national defense. Your brothers' great strategies for saving the times can be used to develop them. We hope that you will resolutely go north to accept your new posts, or first go to Guangdong to personally present everything, as indicated in Chairman Chiang's telegram to the east. We sincerely hope that you will accept our sincere words." The names listed on this telegram include Gu Zhutong, Xue Yue, Liu Xing, Liu Jianxu, Fan Songfu, Wu Qiwu, Guo Rudong, Li Jue, Hao Mengling, You Guocai, Guo Enyan, etc. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The original telegram stated: "(Official titles omitted) Having just received the clear order from the National Government, we respectfully believe that your honorable assumption of a new post is what the people of the whole country eagerly hope for. We, your comrades-in-arms, greatly celebrate the successful completion of unification, and from now on, we will unite as one to wash away national humiliation. Moreover, resisting aggression and saving the country is the proposition of you and your brothers. At a time when strong neighbors are pressing in on us and dangers multiply, it is the time for soldiers to be sincere and dedicate their lives. We still hope that you will quickly make a decision, come north gracefully, set an example for soldiers, and leave a lasting reputation. We sincerely inform you, and we hope you will consider and accept our words." (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin Returns to Nanjing to Discuss: The Guangxi Issue is Not Difficult to Resolve; The National Assembly Can Be Held as Scheduled</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Jiang Zuobin returned to Nanjing at 8:00 AM on the 8th after meeting with President Chiang in Lushan. According to what he said to reporters who interviewed him, the weather has been good and the harvests have been plentiful in various parts of China this year. Domestic administration is also tending toward unification and consolidation. This is truly an auspicious sign for the country. The Guangxi issue, I believe, can be resolved in the near future, because at this time of serious national crisis in China, the social trend and the will of the people are all inclined towards peaceful unification. The so-called separatist and militaristic feudal ideas have become a thing of the past and will never succeed. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has always treated Li Bai with generosity and repeatedly telegraphed Li Bai, agreeing to meet him and advising him to take up his post in the north as soon as possible. But before I left Lushan, I did not know whether Li Bai had replied. I believe that if Li Bai can meet and talk with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, all misunderstandings can be resolved immediately, and he can be moved by Chiang's painstaking and loyal spirit of serving the country and be brought back on the right track. Regarding the National Assembly election, although the date of the assembly is approaching, all provinces and cities have been able to follow the procedures promulgated by the General Office and accelerate the process. The representatives of the assembly must be completely elected before October 10, so the assembly is expected to be held as scheduled. As for the sixth, seventh, eighth, and third groups of the General Office, they will also be established soon to provide guidance for various elections. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Interior Jiang Zuobin went to Lushan and is now rushing back to Nanjing by boat via Wuhu to handle the affairs of the Election General Office, which need to be dealt with urgently.

<h3>Levying Income Tax; Notifications Will Be Sent to Various Countries Soon; Overseas Chinese Nationals Will Be Ordered to Pay Taxes According to Regulations</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Before the implementation of the income tax, the Ministry of Finance will consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, in accordance with foreign procedures, notify various countries, ordering overseas Chinese nationals in those countries to pay income tax in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax. According to general observations, income tax is a good tax in the world. Our overseas Chinese nationals have also paid income tax to the governments of their respective countries. It is expected that various friendly countries will also unanimously assist us in levying income tax on their overseas Chinese nationals in China. In addition, as the implementation of the income tax is approaching, the Preparatory Office for Central Direct Taxes has requested Minister Kong to recruit 60 graduates from specialized schools or above to cultivate talent for collection. After two months of training at both senior and junior levels, they will be dispatched to income tax collection agencies in various provinces and cities. Once approved, recruitment can begin within this month. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Abyssinia is Not Extinct</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The Italian king has long since officially declared himself also to be the emperor of Abyssinia. Member countries of the League of Nations have long since lifted their economic sanctions against Italy. The national name of Abyssinia will probably gradually disappear from the minds of most people. However, the continued and unremitting spirit of heroic resistance by the black people of Abyssinia still reminds the world, "Abyssinia is not extinct."</p>
<p>This is not an exaggerated statement. The following facts are significant proof: (1) Although the capital of Abyssinia has fallen, the country still has a government. At the beginning of last month, the Abyssinian delegation formally notified the League of Nations, stating that the new government of Abyssinia has been established in the western city of Gore and ordered General Ymru, the former commander of the northern route, to reorganize the national army in order to continue resisting the enemy. (2) Except for a few Abyssinian traitors, the chieftains and people in the interior of Abyssinia are still continuing to resist the Italian army. They have also firmly resolved that the war will not end until all Italian troops are driven out of the country. (3) In the so-called eastern and northern regions that have been occupied by the Italian army, the Italian army is still constantly subjected to attacks by Abyssinian "guerrillas." The capital of Abyssinia and places such as Harar-Dawa are clearly not stable. (There was even news in the middle of last month that an Italian supervisor was killed or seriously injured in Harar.) Even the Tangla Kei region, which the Italian army believes has been completely pacified, often has Abyssinian army surprise attacks. (4) The Italian army has never been able to control traffic routes. It feels impossible to travel on all highways. Even the Jibuti-Addis Ababa Railway, which it relies on as its only route, is often threatened by Abyssinians. The destruction of roads and tracks is often heard.</p>
<p>Now the Abyssinian resistance situation is greatly expanding. According to recent dispatches, the Abyssinian army fought a major battle with the Italian army. The two sides lost a total of 7,000 men. The Italian army lost several thousand. The Abyssinian army has recaptured Dawa. There are concerns that the capital of Abyssinia may be short of food. Another dispatch said that on the 28th of last month, on St. George's Day, several thousand Abyssinians launched a fierce attack on the capital in three routes and surrounded it. They destroyed 2,000 Italian trucks and shot down an Italian plane. At the same time, the Italian garrison in Moggio, about 30 miles from the capital of Abyssinia, was attacked by 2,000 Abyssinian tribesmen. A column of Italian motorized soldiers composed of heavy trucks was ambushed in a certain place. All the vehicles were destroyed and 200 soldiers were killed. Another dispatch said that Abyssinian General Kassa's son led a large army around Lake Tana to fight the Italian army. Hahalia, the former Abyssinian ambassador to France, also led a column of Abyssinian soldiers to dig trenches and garrison the railway near the capital of Abyssinia, waiting for an opportunity to move. General Ymru, the former commander of the northern route, led an Abyssinian army of 40,000 men to advance toward Dawa and the capital of Abyssinia and has recruited the remaining Abyssinian troops to form a large army of 60,000 men. These messages came from the dissemination of several international news agencies that would not promote failed black nations. At least a large part of them is credible.</p>
<p>All of this shows how precarious the rule of Italian imperialism is in Abyssinia. No matter how much the Italian side boasts that Abyssinia is "peaceful," the iron facts above cannot be concealed after all. Moreover, the Italian army's restoration of its wartime organization can also be used as collateral proof of the Abyssinian people's fierce resistance.</p>
<p>The Abyssinians have such a strong sense of national consciousness and such a brave and hard-fought spirit. This makes us not only believe that Abyssinia is not extinct, but also predict that Abyssinia cannot be destroyed. Isn't the revival of Poland a historical precedent?</p>
<h3>Bandit Troops in Chahar North Retreat and Gather in Shangdu; Rumor that Prince De is Being Held in Bailingmiao; Telegrams To and From Suiyuan are Being Detained</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Zhangjiakou, the puppet Inner Mongolian troops have not fled into Suiyuan in recent days, but the troops are still being continuously expanded.

<h3>Japanese Military Staff Officer Talks About: The Cause of the Suiyuan Incident is Complicated; Hashimoto Could Arrive in Tianjin on the 19th</h3>

Nagami will return to his country on the 22nd to take up his new post. The military believes that the Hebei-Chahar political power is not yet complete, so after Hashimoto arrives, a meeting of special affairs agency directors will be held to decide on a strategy to promote its realization. The cause of the Suiyuan East incident is complicated. In order to thoroughly understand the truth, I will go to investigate at the beginning of next month and decide on an attitude after returning.

<h3>Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Editorial: This is an Excellent Opportunity to Adjust Sino-Japanese Relations; Also Uses Anglo-Japanese Friendship as a Contrast</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) An editorial in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 8th, titled "Opportunity to Adjust Sino-Japanese National Relations," stated that the downfall of the Southwest faction can be said to be an opportunity for Chiang Kai-shek to use his free hand to open up Sino-Japanese relations. Now the Nanjing government has the opportunity to practice its long-standing advocacy of stabilizing East Asia through diplomacy toward Japan. The Anglo-Japanese relationship in East Asia is in a subordinate position. Therefore, before the opportunity to adjust Sino-Japanese national relations arrives, it is hoped that the authorities of China and Japan will strive to make efforts. (8th Allied News Dispatch)</p>
<h3>London Times Editorial: Japan Seeks Friendship with Britain; Foreign Trade is Declining; Eager to Re-establish Friendship with Britain</h3>
<p>Whether it Succeeds Depends on Sincerely Respecting Chinese Sovereignty</p>
<p>(London) The Times today published an article stating, "In recent days, various parties have hinted that Japan is thinking of repairing its old friendship with Britain. Japan may be too self-confident, delusional, and somewhat rash about its future, but the result is only to see it fall into solitude. Japan's overseas trade is far from bright, and 'Manchukuo' is definitely not a paradise for Japan's surplus population. It can also be asserted that Japan's suspicion of Soviet Russia is increasing day by day. Even if war can be avoided, the ideological and economic conflicts between these two major countries will still leave significant traces in the Far East. In this environment, the revival of the Anglo-Japanese alliance is naturally welcomed by Japan. Looking at the recent records of the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on British commercial policy, one can see the true motive of Japan's eagerness to befriend Britain in the face of the declining Japanese overseas trade. If the basic conditions for Japan and Britain to seek friendship include sincerely respecting China's sovereignty, rather than merely paying lip service, then Britain should naturally welcome it."

<h3>Terauchi Strongly Urges Hirota to Implement Administrative Reforms; Hirota's Attitude Tends to Be Passive</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Hirota Cabinet's policy of reforming all aspects of administration is the only policy that the general public hopes to see realized. However, recently, there have been various opinions within the cabinet, especially strong opposition to extending the period of compulsory education and the electricity control plan. As a result, the Hirota Cabinet's innovative attitude is gradually becoming passive. After the cabinet meeting on the 7th, Minister of War Terauchi advised Prime Minister Hirota, saying that the Hirota Cabinet issued an important statement at the beginning of its formation, clarifying the government's determination to move towards reforming all aspects of administration. Furthermore, a temporary cabinet meeting was convened on March 17th to decide on the political program and declare its implementation. Therefore, national policies such as nationalization of electricity, strengthening aviation, and controlling maritime transport should be decided as soon as possible. If the government believes it is right, it should repel opposition movements based on the interests of a small number of people and move forward with what it believes in. This is of utmost importance. (8th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Minister of Finance Baba and the Prime Minister Consult on National Policy Issues; Consultation First Conducted by Relevant Ministries; National Policy Conference to Be Held in Early September</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After the cabinet meeting on the 7th, Minister of Finance Baba met with Prime Minister Hirota to exchange views on the issue of reopening the National Policy Cabinet Conference. As a result, it was decided to study national policies in August and convene the National Policy Cabinet Conference in early September. According to the Minister of Finance, national policies such as trade, fuel, and aviation, which are related to two or three ministries, should be consulted in advance among the relevant cabinet members. As for the national policies of each ministry, the Minister of Finance will conduct preliminary negotiations with the ministers in charge to determine which should be adopted as important national policies and which should not be adopted. This will make it easier to decide on the adoption or non-adoption of national policies when the National Policy Cabinet Conference is held. Therefore, the preliminary negotiations between the Minister of Finance and the ministers of each ministry in August can dominate the fate of national policies. The outcome is highly noteworthy.

<h3>Japan Oil Company Plans to Agree on Exports to China; Negotiations to Be Held with British and American Companies</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since June 1st, the export of kerosene to China has adopted a tax refund system, so it has recently tended to increase. It is expected that one million cases can be exported this year. The plan of kerosene operators is therefore unexpectedly easy to implement. However, domestic export companies, such as Nippon Oil, Ogakei, Hayayama, Aikoku, and Asahi, believe that the recent increase in exports will inevitably lead to competition. Therefore, in order to promote future exports, it is considered necessary to agree on the following two items: (1) Domestic companies should separately agree on export volumes and export prices for each company; (2) Negotiate sales channels and market prices with British and American companies in China. The companies are currently negotiating concrete plans, and the export agreement between domestic companies has recently been successfully concluded. The internal control work has been completed, so domestic companies will propose to British and American oil companies to agree on market prices and sales fields. (8th, Domei News Agency)</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Japan and Russia; 100 Japanese Soldiers Killed? A Traveler from Dalian Speaks</h3>
<p>(Dalian) Today, a traveler who arrived here from northern Manchuria described a shocking incident to reporters from various newspapers, saying that Japanese troops and Soviet border guards had a serious conflict on the 5th of this month at the Five Stations area, the eastern terminus of the northern Manchurian Railway. However, this matter has not yet been officially confirmed. According to the traveler, more than 100 Japanese soldiers died in the conflict. However, this statement should be temporarily reserved pending official confirmation. If this conflict is true, Dalian should have received the news earlier. Although reporters here are skeptical of the traveler's statement, some reporters still believe that such news may have been detained by Japanese and "Manchurian" news censors. The traveler also said that after the Japanese soldiers died at the beginning of the conflict, the Japanese military authorities immediately sent reinforcements, and the two sides engaged in fierce battles, suffering heavy losses. The Russian soldiers were eventually repelled. Subsequently, Russian reinforcements also arrived. As of the time the traveler departed, the Japanese and Russian troops were confronting each other, and only occasionally exchanged fire. The situation in the Five Stations area is currently very bad.

<h3>Soviet New and Old Public Bonds</h3>
<p>(TASS, Moscow, July 7 dispatch) On July 2, the Soviet government ordered the issuance of a new public bond of 4 billion rubles and the exchange of seven types of old public bonds, totaling 860 million bonds, worth 14 billion rubles.

<h3>Purge in the Military and Coup d'état (4)</h3>
<p>— Jia He</p>
<p>Whether Minister of War Terauchi used such means to hasten the collapse of the Hirota Cabinet is something that will happen later. We dare not predict it, nor do we need to predict it. What should be said is why the Zaibatsu-satisfied personnel of the Ugaki faction would criticize the Hirota Cabinet? This question needs to be explored from two directions. The first is the financial policy, which will be discussed later when there is an opportunity to discuss the budget. The second is the estimation of the entire future of Japanese capitalism (in fact, the former can also be merged under this item). Now we will focus on the latter.</p>
<p>Based on the traditional relationship before and after the Meiji Restoration, Japanese modern history has long had records of the opposition between the military and the bourgeoisie. However, in the early days, the military, centered on the samurai class, either preserved the long-standing samurai habit of despising merchants for the propertied class, or it was a struggle for interests between the nobility and the up-and-coming industrial magnates. This is essentially different from the actions of General Araki, who began to incorporate bankrupt farmers and declining small property owners after the "May 15 Incident." When Senjūrō Hayashi came to power, the military's struggle against the Zaibatsu changed its nature. Even the leaders of the upper echelons of the military rapidly became like Aritomo Yamagata, secretly exchanging gifts with the Zaibatsu. Thus, the Zaibatsu's own struggle, with the expansion of the military and the issue of Manchuria, developed into divisions within the military-Zaibatsu factions. Coupled with the region, personal relationships, departments, etc., of the military leaders, these factions became more and more differentiated day by day. The main driving force that promoted their differentiation was not the subjective will of the leaders, but the external economic forces. It was not the issue of "national polity" that drove Sadao Araki and Kuniaki Tanaka (leader of the Meirin Association) to join hands with Fusanosuke Kuhara and Hiroichirō Ishihara (owner of the Ishihara Zaibatsu), but the desire of Nissan and Ishihara to divide up the profits of industry, using the aversion of young soldiers to capitalism to push the military into the vortex of political struggle. Currently, the entire distress of the Zaibatsu is not about estimating how to suppress these reckless people, but hesitating about how to overcome their own predicament. Although the sun rises higher and higher every day, the outlet for "Made in Japan" products is shrinking day by day. Although the world is large, apart from this courteous and respectful "perpetual imperial lineage" historical country - "China" - almost all use closed-door policies to treat us, the future masters of East Asia. If there is no "Imperial Army" that dedicates itself to the battlefield, can the Zaibatsu open up such a predicament themselves? Naturally, they cannot. This shows the position of the military. The more Japanese property owners are hit by the international economic recession, the more they need the military. The military becomes a more valuable commodity, and its voice in the political arena becomes more powerful. As a result, the situation of the tail wagging the dog is formed today. However, this is not to say that the military can leave the Zaibatsu. Without the Zaibatsu's industry, the Zaibatsu's technical talents, and even the Zaibatsu's capital, the military, which loses its social nature, can do nothing. In the hearts of the Zaibatsu, they all hope that the military will purge itself and no longer create a lawless situation. As for expanding military preparations, etc., they belong to their own interests, and in today's recession, they can even be said to be a means of saving themselves, so they can naturally be discussed slowly. Little do they know that if they slightly satisfy the military's demands for expanding military preparations, they will tear up international treaties. Thus, the military expansion that is needed by Japanese capitalism itself suddenly brings external pressure. In the situation of shipbuilding and the Soviet Union strengthening its Far East military, the Japanese military is forced to engage in military expansion in a competition between children and adults. Such military expansion is beyond the financial capacity of Japan, so the Zaibatsu's rationalization of the budget and the military's external resistance are reflected in the Hirota Cabinet, revealing many unresolvable contradictions. Of course, General Terauchi belongs to the stable faction, but the so-called stable faction has not lost its ability to criticize or speak to the Zaibatsu, and the arduous task of "purging the military" is proceeding step by step. Without unexpected adjustments, without the reform of "renovating all administrative aspects," based on past experience, it will provoke unexpected disasters. Military expansion and administrative innovation are grace, and military purge is power. Only by combining grace and power can we overcome the difficulties felt by Miyakesaka at this stage. Therefore, not to mention Terauchi alone, even Kazuinari Ugaki himself will have to take this path. On the other hand, the work of "purging the military" has only just begun, and the latent power of the Araki faction cannot be eliminated in the shortest time. This makes Minister of War Terauchi unable to exert his skills without any worries. The above two points combine to create the current situation. As this situation develops, it may be the "coup d'état" that we hear periodically.</p>
<p>If Kanji Nan succeeds Ugaki as Governor-General of Korea, then Ugaki's job will naturally be to try to form a cabinet. From this point of view, the grounding of the "Hirota Maru" makes people think of that boatman who has a great reputation for handling boats, but has never been to the sea, which is not without reason.</p>

<h3>Spanish Civil War: General Offensive by Both Armies Has Begun; Fierce Fighting Around the Portuguese Border; Government Side Strictly Prevents Internal Treachery</h3>
<p>Madrid: According to news from the front line from the special correspondent of this agency, the government army began a general offensive yesterday. Artillery and aircraft bombed the rebel positions, and have not stopped as of now. Infantry advanced under the cover of artillery fire, and made some progress as a result. A team of shock troops has now reached the town of Guadarrama, and another route is advancing towards the Leon Pass via the town of Navacerrada, with support infantry arriving one after another. Fierce fighting is expected there today. Minister of War Salavete recently told the press that the front line situation is extremely smooth. According to news from Sigüenza, the government army captured two rebel cannons and five mortars, and killed a rebel captain and 40 soldiers. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>Burgos: According to a communiqué recently released by the rebel headquarters in the north, after General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the revolutionary army in the south, arrived in Seville, he immediately ordered an advance towards Madrid, defeating the government armies in Badajoz and Cáceres, capturing many prisoners. One of the senior officers of the government army, Colonel Pu Yi Tang Chai La, was also among those captured, and a large number of military weapons and several armored vehicles were seized. In the north, the revolutionary army is currently increasing troops to various positions, so there is no major battle. Recently, three government army pilots defected with their planes. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid: The rebel army is getting closer to the capital city today, and government leaders are therefore very angry with certain countries that are supplying arms to the rebel army, and are increasingly suspicious of government army officers. Former Foreign Minister Fulasige was arrested and imprisoned today, but the charges have not been announced. President Achaana also dismissed the Consul General in New York, and all senior police officers have been dismissed. The socialist mayor of Iskoliyl was imprisoned today, as were 140 monks, and it was announced that the police will search the monasteries. The President appointed General Ligel as commander-in-chief of the Guadarrama army today. (7th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>Front Line of the Rebel Army in Northern Spain: General Mara, commander of the rebel army in the north, told a Associated Press reporter today that the vanguard of the revolutionary army has reached the outskirts of Madrid, and the houses of civilians outside the city are hung with white cloth to indicate neutrality. Government army aircraft bombed villages in this area this morning to prevent the rebel army from advancing. (7th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>Madrid: Fierce fighting is reported to have occurred near Badajoz, Spain, near the border between Portugal and France, and is still ongoing. Both sides are trying to occupy a superior position before launching a major offensive. Rebel leader General Franco is preparing to seize Madrid after succeeding here. The government army defending Badajoz was in danger for several hours due to a mutiny by the city guards. However, after the city guards ran out of bullets, they were suppressed by the republicans. A rebel plane then flew over the city and dropped several heavy bombs on the barracks. It is reported that the barracks have been completely destroyed. Correspondents from Reuters at various centers telegraphed the situation in other parts of Spain as follows: When officials in Malaga sent a telegram to report that the rebel army in Cadiz had surrendered, Madrid was overjoyed. When the Interior Minister continued to announce that "the news of the fall of Cadiz was transmitted too early," the crowd was disappointed again. The French ship Robinson, sailing from Algeciras to Antwerp, was bombed by a plane of unknown nationality five miles from Gibraltar. The bomb fell 220 yards from the ship. The flagship of the British squadron, HMS Douglas, has arrived in Palma, Majorca. The area is currently in the hands of the rebels. It is reported that the government army is currently preparing to launch a major offensive against Palma with twelve seaplanes and 3,200 soldiers collected in Valencia. In addition to four Germans who died in Valencia, three other Germans have met with misfortune in Spain, including a girl. The German government has demanded compensation from the Spanish government for the losses in this unfortunate incident in Valencia. On Menorca, the second largest island in the Balearic Islands, there was a popular uprising against the government. It is reported that no less than 120 rebels were killed, including a naval admiral.

<h3>Algeciras: Warships Bombard for a Day; Fortifications Destroyed, Fires Everywhere; British Consul's Wife Hit by Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>Algeciras: This area has suffered a day-long bombardment from Spanish government warships, with fires breaking out in many parts of the port. A total of 70 people have died, including one woman and one child, and 60 have been injured. The wife of British Vice-Consul Bagingtai has also been injured. There are many fires within the city, and the power plant has also been destroyed. The circumstances of the British Consul's wife's injury are quite bizarre. When a government warship's shell penetrated the wall of the consulate's reception room, Mr. and Mrs. Bagingtai were talking inside. The roof collapsed from the impact, only injuring the Consul's wife; it can be considered fortunate. (7th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Gibraltar: As a result of the Spanish government warships bombarding Algeciras, the Argentine Consulate has been completely destroyed, and the British Consulate has been hit by two shells, rendering it uninhabitable. One shell exploded inside the building. British Vice-Consul Mr. Bigeonsal and his wife narrowly escaped danger, but Mrs. Bi was slightly injured by falling debris. It is said that her escape was miraculous. All buildings facing the sea had their glass windows and other features shattered beyond recognition, and several houses have been destroyed by shells. It is generally believed that the Spanish government warships have disabled the Algeciras fortifications, as the fortifications fired several rounds but did not retaliate against the warships. It is said that the first shell from the "Jaime I" killed all the gunners on the rebel warship "Taitu", and the remaining sailors immediately abandoned ship and fled, but later returned to the ship and extinguished the fire inside. The "Jaime I", the cruiser "Libertad", and the destroyer "Cervantes" once sailed out to sea, then reappeared in the port this afternoon and bombarded Algeciras, Tarifa, and Ceuta. The "Jaime I" approached the Algeciras harbor and fired continuously. The "Libertad" and "Cervantes" engaged in a mutual bombardment with two rebel seaplanes that arrived from Ceuta, Morocco. While the battle was raging, thirty British residents of Algeciras escaped to Gibraltar by car and arrived safely. A Reuters reporter from Gibraltar traveled to Algeciras by car and saw that almost all the residents had evacuated, and all the houses were locked up. As a result of this bombardment, at least twenty people died and fifty were injured. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Cartagena, Spain: Officers of the Spanish coastal defense gunboat "Jaime I" planned to join the rebels but were detained by the ship's soldiers and have been handed over to the military authorities in Malaga for investigation. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Barrio, who was previously appointed by the government as Chairman of the Administrative Committee for the Mediterranean coastal provinces, has recently arrived in this port to inspect the defenses.

<h3>Gibraltar: Air and Sea Forces Clash; Britain Prepares to Take Appropriate Measures</h3>
<p>London: Spanish government warships and rebel aircraft have been clashing near the British territory of Gibraltar in recent days. For example, when rebel troops from Spanish Morocco crossed the sea by ship, government warships fired on them. Two shells landed near the Gibraltar racecourse, and two more landed in the harbor. At the same time, rebel aircraft retaliated with bombs, and one large bomb landed in the polo field. It is reported that the British government has protested to both the Spanish government and the rebel authorities, and has instructed the Gibraltar authorities to take all appropriate measures to deal with such incidents if they occur again. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>London: It was recently stated by responsible sources that the government protested to both the Spanish government and the rebel authorities because the naval and air forces of both sides were fighting in the territorial waters of British Gibraltar, and stray bullets fell into the harbor, endangering British interests. However, neither side was able to prevent this from happening. Therefore, the government decided to protect the dignity of the British flag in Spanish territory on its own. At the same time, regarding the French-proposed non-intervention agreement, the government will continue to work hard to achieve its completion as soon as possible. However, political figures are pessimistic about the prospects of these negotiations, for the following reasons: (A) As far as Germany is concerned, after four members of the youth wing of the Nazi Party in Germany were killed in the village of Sant Martí outside Barcelona, Spain, Germany protested to the Spanish government and demanded that those responsible be punished. If the Madrid government cannot give Germany a satisfactory answer, Germany may also take responsibility for protecting its interests in Spain. This is what political figures fear. Currently, Germany has expressed its support for France's application, but on the condition that the Soviet Union does not aid the Madrid government, and that the German government not only supplies the Spanish rebel General Franco with commercial aircraft, but has also transported a large number of arms and ammunition to support the rebels. If a non-intervention agreement can be concluded quickly, it may be enough to make Germany know its place. Unfortunately, the chances of this agreement being established are very slim. (B) As for Portugal, the only country that has not yet responded to France's application is Portugal. It is said that the Portuguese government intends to make three demands: 1. The neutral status of the port of Tangier in North Africa must be accepted by both sides of the Spanish conflict, as well as other countries. 2. Britain and France must guarantee Portugal's territorial integrity. (C) As for Italy, among the three issues raised by Italy regarding the French proposal, the two concerning the cessation of donations and the adoption of supervisory measures to ensure that all countries uniformly abide by the non-intervention agreement are difficult for all countries to accept. This is also where the obstacles lie. In short, if the non-intervention agreement requires lengthy negotiations and cannot be established quickly, then the situation is urgent and critical, and it is feared that a serious incident may occur before there is time for calm discussion. This is what British people are extremely wary of. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Lisbon: It has been confirmed that the leader of the Spanish rebels, General Franco, has crossed the sea from Tetouan, Spanish Morocco, and arrived in the mainland city of Seville. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Lisbon: After arriving in Seville from Tetouan, Spanish Morocco, General Franco has taken the position of Commander-in-Chief of all southern armies. All rebel forces in Andalusia, Badajoz, Huelva, and Granada are under his command, in order to launch a major northern expedition and join forces with General Mola's troops in the north to attack the capital, Madrid. In addition, fierce fighting is currently taking place in the province of Badajoz, which borders Portugal. A column led by rebel Colonel Asensio has occupied the city of Mérida, cutting off the transport line between Madrid and Badajoz. It is expected that Badajoz will fall soon. Portuguese troops are currently conducting exercises near the capital to prepare for any eventuality. Furthermore, after serious disturbances occurred on the Portuguese island of Madeira in the Atlantic Ocean yesterday, the government has dispatched four gunboats loaded with troops to the island to cooperate with the original garrison and police to maintain order. The ship "Amelia" has returned from the island, bringing back many rioters who will be tried by a military tribunal organized by the government. (8th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Germany Declares to Britain: No Intervention in Spain; Denies Sending More Warships</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to well-informed sources here, the German government has currently decided not to actively intervene in the Spanish civil war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has today received the French government's proposal for non-intervention in Spain, and it is reported that it has accepted it in principle. Semi-official sources here stated today that the German government will make every effort to protect German nationals in Spain, but does not want to encourage a situation in which European countries are divided into two opposing groups of socialists and fascists. However, if German nationals in Spain continue to be harmed or German ships continue to be bombarded, the result will be retaliation by German warships. (8th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London: German Chargé d'Affaires Prince Bismarck visited the Foreign Office today. It is said that he declared to the office that the German government does not intend to take any action in Spain, and denied that German warships have transported ammunition to the Spanish rebels. He also said that Germany does not want to worsen the international situation by providing any assistance to either side in Spain out of political sympathy. In addition, the German Embassy has denied that Ribbentrop, a close confidant of German Chancellor Hitler, advocated sending troops to Barcelona. Political figures believe that after the German diplomatic authorities issued this statement, the situation has become much clearer. This is why the British government, before the governments of Italy, Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Netherlands, will support the French draft of the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war. For example, British Ambassador to Germany Sir Phipps met with German Foreign Minister Neurath last night and stated that the British government urgently wants to see this agreement established. In addition, several British warships are stationed in several Spanish ports to protect British nationals. Regarding the protection of nationals, the British authorities in Gibraltar have also received instructions to prepare to take all effective measures, but joint action with Germany has not been considered.

<p>London: The French government today began distributing the plan for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war to various countries, saying that time is of the essence and action must be taken immediately.

<p>Berlin: Officials here announced today that the German Chargé d'Affaires in Spain has again lodged a serious protest with the Catalan autonomous government, demanding compensation for the murder of four German nationals near Barcelona. It is also understood that Chancellor Hitler is very angry about the anti-German sentiment in Spain, so whether to accept the French proposal for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war is questionable. After Germany protested to the Spanish government, it will send more warships to Spanish territorial waters. (7th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Since Greek Prime Minister Metaxas implemented a dictatorial political system, the various left-wing parties in the country have expressed their opposition. According to news from Athens, the leaders of the country's major political parties, such as Republican leader Cafantaris, Liberal Party leader Papanastasiou, the son of the late People's Party leader Tsaldaris, and Senate Speaker Gonatas, were summoned by King George II today to meet in the palace. They protested against Metaxas's establishment of a dictatorial political system and declared to the King that they were prepared to restore the parliamentary system and organize a nationwide constitutional government. They also said that the various political parties originally supported the monarchy, but since the establishment of the dictatorial political system, their trust in the monarchy has been shaken. Afterwards, the King informed Prime Minister Metaxas of the opinions expressed by the leaders of the various political parties. In addition, Liberal Party right-wing leader Sophoulis refused to attend the audience, saying, "The King personally promised three days ago that he would never allow the establishment of a dictatorial political system. Now, why has he gone back on his word? In my opinion, the King must also bear responsibility." The King then boarded a destroyer at 5:00 PM today to go to Corfu for the summer, planning to stay there until mid-September before returning to the capital. (7th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>(Paris) After the government's proposal to nationalize the arms industry was passed by the Chamber of Deputies, it was immediately submitted to the Senate for discussion. Cabinet Coordinator and Minister of National Defense Dala Di delivered a speech in the Senate yesterday to defend the case. He said, "In order to strengthen national defense, the government does not need to establish a national monopoly system for the arms industry, but should change to national supervision to seek uniformity. This new system is based on the two principles of nationalization and national supervision. Although only a few necessary industries are planned to be nationalized, according to the bill proposed by the government, the Minister of National Defense can exercise supervision over the national arms manufacturing industry and find ways to prevent the activities of certain foreign manufacturers. For various industries preparing for nationalization, the government can add special machinery and hoard a large number of goods in peacetime. All this cannot be done by private manufacturers. When a war breaks out, the country will mobilize, and the national industry can be used for the country's use. Furthermore, in terms of participating soldiers, they all unanimously advocate that the profits obtained by arms merchants from selling arms should be absolutely eliminated in wartime, and should be restricted as much as possible in peacetime. This coincides with the government's bill." (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Memoirs of the Emperor of Abyssinia</h3>
<p>A Paris newspaper once published the memoirs of the Emperor of Abyssinia. These memoirs were dictated by the Emperor to the French journalist Griolet on a ship to England recently.</p>
<p>In the first part, the Emperor gave a historical account of the period of the struggle for power among the feudal lords. In the second part, the Emperor stated the conspiracy of Italy against Abyssinia, saying: "The most unique thing is that those who declare to the world that my country is not unified are often those who are trying in vain to divide my country. Unfortunately, I do not have the rest of her to describe the full history of the events unfavorable to my neighbors, but I recall the manager of Bagendra, the husband of Queen Sao Di Tou, and the riots of Chief Gugus, which were instigated by the Italians. Not far from the Databo Station is Godal, where Chief Gugus resided. The Italians had a senior nobleman, Borel, there. The residents respected Borel very much because of his old age, and because he legally married an Abyssinian woman and had a very large family. Borel lived according to Abyssinian customs, and therefore maintained close ties with the people. He began to cleverly promote everywhere, saying that the current ruler of the country is Gugus, who is the only one who loves his father and does not allow Europeans to expand his province, and investigates everything about "white culture." According to his opinion, I am neglecting the culture of Abyssinia. Gugus also supported the Italian agent, Duke Franchi Gi. This man also maintained close relations with the Ainu.</p>
<p>When Gugus passed a resolution to start a war against our country, he was killed in the Battle of Kvarara. Twenty years of work by the Italians were turned to ashes by my army in twenty-four hours. Another day I was honored as Emperor, and my coronation ceremony was held in November 1930.</p>
<p>The Ainu chiefs often colluded with the Italians... In 1932, with the help of the Italians, he helped his wife's brother escape and wanted to unite with him to oppose our country. This method failed. The imperial army was ready in a few days. External money failed. However, the Italians never considered themselves defeated. In 1931, they wanted to establish a commercial counselor for the consulate and establish a new consulate in Markos, the capital of Gosa. There is no basis for the existence of such counselors, because no Italian businessman - whether white or black - lives in the area where such counselors are located. We have tolerated it to prove our love, although we know that such counselors are carrying out political propaganda to oppose the establishment of our country."</p>
<p>Next, the Emperor stated the famous Huarwar incident in 1934, when the Italian border guards invaded the Abyssinian border by 120 kilometers and refused to withdraw from this territory. The Emperor continued:</p>
<p>"We have the right to surround the Italian army and take all the methods needed to clear the obvious destruction of our country's territory. However, in order to implement a compromise policy and respect the treaties of the League of Nations and the Italian consul, we have not done so. We want to act in accordance with international law... We know what is happening and demand that we do not stay in the discussion of sovereignty. We firmly believe in our own justice, so we agree to avoid this principled question, and the decision of the arbitration does not place any responsibility on either side. This is our first disappointment."</p>
<p>The third part of the Emperor's memoirs is devoted to the beginning of the Italian-Abyssinian War.</p>
<p>In this part, the Emperor said:</p>
<p>"It is not possible to wage war using European methods. What's more, our military equipment, not only the artillery, but also the machine guns are ridiculous. The northern army operates under various geographical conditions, and every small section of the land can be used as a war position. Its tactics are to conduct guerrilla warfare that makes the enemy feel extremely serious. Only under favorable conditions can the enemy be directly attacked. When the enemy turns to defense, they must retreat. This tactic pursues two major goals: an attitude of cherishing life, because it is recognized that Chen Di's battle can destroy a large number of lives. Secondly, this tactic is intended to keep the enemy constantly tense before the rainy season, when the enemy's military equipment will lose most of its effectiveness.</p>
<p>"This army contacted the Italians later. I once ordered Chief Gugus's army to occupy 50 kilometers of the border, and ordered Chief Sem's army to occupy 80 kilometers from the railway. I firmly believed that the neutral zone should be observed by the League of Nations, and it has indeed been observed. It is not easy to explain this position to the Abyssinian people. They thought this was the first territorial concession. When the enemy's actions have reached a serious level, it is also difficult to make the Abyssinian people believe that they must retreat. Even such a valuable person as Chief Sem also withdrew from Aduwa in tears, and as a result, everyone knew what I was expecting, and all fought under the slogan of "cleaning up internal traitors." Perhaps this over-caution has failed. However, we can never predict that the disparity in military equipment will not cause fear among our people...</p>
<p>Gugus's rebellion was not the result of pro-Italianism. This is the only chance for the rebellion, and at the same time, the second-rate officers proved that the Abyssinian people will never conspire with foreigners. Gugus was acting under the shadow of fear. His carpenters also estimated the great superiority of Italian military equipment. Lack of experience has weakened their belief in the resilience of their own soldiers. Heavy profits and high salaries have played an extra role.</p>
<p>"The Italians once estimated the so-called rebellion of the Abyssinian people in 'Tritribery'. It is said that the Abyssinian people in the provinces of Barummiel and Gosham were selected by the Italians as soldiers in the Tritribia War. After serving the Italians for ten or five years, they were sent back to their hometowns. However, the fact is that these 'Tritribery' people have received good training and education, and are the most determined and outstanding anti-Italian fighters. These people often express dissatisfaction when they come back from serving in the Italian army, because they are given the most dangerous work, but they are not given the scheduled rewards... The details of the Hauner incident are well known, so there is no need to repeat them. However, the incident in the south caused by the large-scale Italian invasion of Niger is still little known... This kind of Italian advancement is only because Chief Kista wanted to attack Doro and broke into Italian Somaliland. During a considerable period, there were 15,000 to 20,000 troops who had broken away from the base by 400 kilometers and were using cargo trucks to supply their food. The enemy's air force caused Chief Kista to retreat and lost contact with the base, and was bombed by the enemy. The Italian air force destroyed the medicine storage, causing the Kista army to lose the necessary medicines for treating fever and disease, and diseases spread in this area. When the connection with the base was established, Chief Kista had stopped retreating, and at that time, enemy aircraft were bombing residents on the transportation road."</p>
<p>In the fourth and fifth parts of his memoirs, the Emperor recounted the activities of the Italian Air Force. He said that because most of the terrain is mountainous, Italian planes fly very high, which is why the Abyssinian people shot down very few planes (18 planes). However, for this reason, Italian planes fly very high, making it easier for the Abyssinian people to defend themselves. The Emperor also said:</p>
<p>"The route of the plane seems very far away. Our lookout posted on all the mountain peaks, with the help of all the bushes, warns our army of the danger in the sky. This activity is very good. An army of 10,000 to 20,000 people is always hidden, without a trace... When the Italian pilots have seen this, they begin to bomb all the wooded areas, but without any effect. So Italian pilots were ordered to bomb the churches, as if our people were hiding there. From a military point of view, this is the most cruel and pointless act. Women, children and the elderly died under the ruins of the collapsed walls. Every church has a library, and some of the documents contained therein are the only evidence of antiquity, precious in science, literature, and art... I don't need to talk about the paintings that decorate these churches... For example, Dunbianni, especially Xier, the treasures lost there can never be recovered."</p>
<p>The Emperor continued—</p>
<p>"The air force usually used to deal with the Abyssinian people has not been very effective... Therefore, the Italian General Staff decided to end the military before the rainy season. The new tactics of the Italians are as follows: they often use poison gas and choose residents far away from the positions as targets for attack. At the beginning of the war, the Italians used tear gas bombs... The Abyssinian people immediately adapted to this point and dispersed when attacking. Changes in the wind direction rendered this gas ineffective. The Italians had used a kind of chlorine at this time, but it was very primitive. They dropped small buckets full of this liquid from the plane. Very few people were in these small buckets. The number of victims is limited, and the infected area is also limited... Then the Italian General Staff, fearing the failure of the Makaer raid and that the Italians had been driven out of Xier, decided to adopt another method of chemical warfare, which no country can resist without the necessary self-defense technology. The plane is equipped with a sprayer... Each plane has nine, fifteen, eighteen planes in groups, with each other The distance is such that the mist sprayed by each aircraft can form a large mist with the mist sprayed by other aircraft... It has been extended for several days since January 1926. Anyone who hits this kind of chlorine raindrop, and those who drink poisoned water, suffer from severe eczema. Only thatched huts or jungles can avoid it. In a country with lush trees and greenery, people cannot touch things with their hands, because death is everywhere. Corpses can be found everywhere... This poisonous gas immediately spread throughout the country. In the past, the Abyssinian people said they were fighting with people and believed in their own strength. However, when the Abyssinian people started to use tools that they considered inhuman, they began to believe that they were fighting with demons." (External Theory Society)</p>

<h3>Situation in Eastern Sui Suddenly Becomes Tense, One Side Targets Shanxi and Suiyuan, Rebel Army Advances Are Repelled</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, The situation in eastern Sui is becoming increasingly tense, and the authorities in Shanxi and Suiyuan have also been paying attention to it for a long time. Unexpectedly, on July 30th and the 2nd of this month, the rebel army of Li Shouxin, along with the bandits in northern Chahar, did invade. Although they were all defeated, this incident has aroused the attention of all parties, because this is a move by Li's rebels with a background.</p>
<p>Since a certain party has coveted Inner Mongolia, the so-called re-creation of the "Mongolia State" and "Dayuan State" have been widely publicized. Subsequently, the "eastern Hebei" and "northern Chahar" issues have occurred one after another. That is, a certain party has a planned chronic invasion action. Therefore, after repeated negotiations, there has been no effect. After the fall of the six counties in northern Chahar, the puppet army has successively arrived. The automobile road and the airport have also been built. After the plan is completed, they will force De Wang to recruit Mongolian soldiers and expand their strength as a vanguard. The current formation has three divisions, all under the command of Li's rebels Shouxin.</p>
<p>The military plan of a certain party is to first occupy eastern Sui, then advance into the provincial capital of Suiyuan, and capture northern Shanxi. If a certain party realizes this plan, Hebei and Chahar will be easily obtained. Therefore, its target has turned to Shanxi and Suiyuan. The advancing troops are divided into three layers. The bandits are the vanguard, the puppet Mongolian army is in the middle, and the army of a certain country is in the last team. Currently, two regiments of soldiers from a certain country have arrived in Zhangbei County, Chahar Province. The airport built by a certain country in Shangdu has also been completed. Li Shouxin is now in Shangdu coordinating everything. In addition, a certain puppet Manchu guerrilla commander went to Tianjin at the beginning of this month. At that time, Yin Rugeng also went to Tianjin from Tong County to secretly discuss changing the security teams of Zhang Qingyu, Zhang Yantian, Li Yunsheng, and Zhao Lei in the war zone into guerrillas, divided into eight teams, and preparing to send a part to northern Chahar to assist in the invasion of eastern Sui. The authorities are paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>On July 30th, several hundred bandits, in the name of the puppet border defense self-defense army,窜entered from northern Chahar and harassed Tumuer Tai, which belongs to Taolin County, Suiyuan Province. The local militia resisted from the fort and fought each other for several hours. The bandits were unable to support and began to retreat towards Shangdu. On the 2nd of this month, the bandits came again and participated in the puppet army to move forward together. The number increased from several hundred to more than two thousand people. They attacked Honggen Ertu, which belongs to Taolin County, and clashed with the cavalry company of Zhao Chengshou's troops stationed there, resulting in a fierce battle. The bandits attacked for two days without success, with casualties of one to two hundred people. At this time, Zhao Chengshou also arrived at Pingdi Quan and sent Peng Brigade Commander to lead cavalry to reinforce the area. At the same time, Damilingsulong, the General Manager of the Inner Mongolia Zheng Huang Banner, also volunteered to lead troops to assist. The bandits were all seriously injured and retreated dozens of miles to the east. In the past three days, the situation in eastern Sui has been calm, and the bandits have not committed any more crimes. The public believes that a certain country has not yet formally launched, so the future problem may inevitably expand. (7th)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Public Security Bureau: Cracking Down on a Major Drug Manufacturing Center, Arresting Ten Japanese Nationals and One Chinese National, Seizing Drugs Worth Over 300,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin Municipal Public Security Bureau recently received a confidential report stating that a large-scale drug manufacturing center was located in the Fifth District of the Sixth District of the city, managed by a certain foreign national. On the 5th, the bureau ordered its subordinates and notified the Japanese police station to conduct a raid. The main suspects, manufacturing equipment, and stored products were all transported to the Japanese police station. The entire case is currently under interrogation. The details of the incident are recorded below.</p>
<p>Organization</p>
<p>At No. 27 Machang Road, located in the Fifth District of the Sixth District of this city, a high-rise building stands, which is the private property of Zhang Huaizhi's younger brother, Zhang Huaibin. The area occupied is no less than several tens of acres, with approximately 40 rooms inside the building. The space remained vacant for many days. Last month, a Chinese man named Wang Yaozu rented the building for a monthly rent of 250 yuan, claiming to organize a "Ping An Transportation Company". They moved in on the 27th of last month and began operations. Japanese nationals frequently entered and exited the premises, and security was unusually tight. There were many suspicious aspects, which attracted the attention of the authorities. After a thorough investigation by Li Zhiping, the captain of the Second Detective Team of the Public Security Bureau, it was discovered that the Ping An Company was indeed a major drug manufacturing center, with a cost of several hundred thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Crackdown</p>
<p>After receiving the report, Li deemed the case important and reported the situation to Director Cheng on the morning of the 5th. Cheng immediately dispatched the Chief of the Security Corps, Tong Zexian, the Chief Inspector, Wang Dianchen, the Chief of the Detective Corps, Yang Enhua, and Captain Li Zhiping, along with officers Chen Chaozhen, Team Leader Tian Jixiang, Squad Leaders Chen Bingheng and Tang Zhenshan, and officers Yang Xiupu and others. They notified the Japanese police station and, with the cooperation of Department Chief Matsushita and special agents Li Zizhen and Zhang Baoting, rode in armored vehicles to the reported location, surrounding the No. 27 building. After knocking on the door for a long time, it seemed that the people inside were aware of the situation and refused to open the door. The team leaders of the Second Team, Tian Jixiang and Tang Zhenshan, used soft ladders to climb over the surrounding wall and bravely jumped down.</p>
<p>Capture</p>
<p>After the door was opened, the officers entered the courtyard and searched each room. A total of ten Japanese suspects were arrested: Watanabe Saburo, Kondo Kanetaro, Itabashi Tomihira, Matsumoto Genichi, Kakuda Yoshiyuki, Nakajima, Mukai Sakue, Suda, Nakamura, and others. One Chinese national, Wang Yaozu, was arrested, and the Chinese ringleader, Li Yurong, escaped. At the scene, 16 vats of manufactured heroin, 12 motors and air conditioners, 3 electric rollers, more than 10 glass filter tubes, and 17 drying vats (filled with unrefined opium paste) were seized, as well as approximately tens of thousands of taels of processed opium and five large packages of white powder, with a total value of over 300,000 yuan. The Japanese side, due to the inconvenience of carrying the opium paste in the drying vats, poured it all into the ditch. All items were loaded onto four heavy trucks, along with the ten Japanese suspects, and transported back to the Japanese police station.</p>
<p>Confession</p>
<p>The Chinese national, Wang Yaozu, was taken back to the Second Team by Captain Li. According to Wang Yaozu's confession, he is 26 years old, a native of this city, and resides in Chentang Zhuangzi. The Ping An Company was moved from Huayuan Street in the Japanese Concession. He is currently working as a cook at the Ping An Company. The fugitive Li Yurong is in charge of running errands. His confession was extremely cunning. However, according to inquiries made by the team to the rental agency, all rental procedures were handled by Wang Yaozu, which proves that Wang is one of the main culprits. The Japanese side stated at the time that the drug den may have been operated by Japanese ruffians and should be subject to Japanese legal judgment. All drugs should be destroyed by the Japanese side. Director Cheng Xixian yesterday ordered Officer Chen Chaozhen to take a formal letter to the Japanese side requesting extradition. Chen returned to the team at 8:30 PM, and it was heard that the result was satisfactory. (6th)</p>
<h3>Gansu Province County Farmers' Association Organization: Only One Level Below the County, Land Administration Bureau Handles Registration</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, stated that the administrative regions of the province's counties were previously divided into several townships. Recently, townships were changed to districts. The so-called "district" is in the same position as the former township. The Farmers' Association Law stipulates that the township farmers' association below the county is now the district farmers' association below the county. However, the name "district" is easily confused with the name of the urban districts below the city. It is now proposed to instruct each county that those using the name "district farmers' association" should still be changed to "township farmers' association". The area of the farmers' association can be specified in the charter. In the southeastern provinces, due to dense populations, most places often have two levels of organization below the county: district and township, with the district being the higher-level farmers' association above the township. The previous instructions to the counties on organizational procedures also stipulated two levels of district and township below the county. However, observing the situation in this province, where the land is vast and the population is sparse, the so-called township in most counties (i.e., the township in the countryside) has households numbering less than several dozen. It is more appropriate to adopt only one level of township below the county. It is proposed that the district farmers' association level in the previously issued organizational procedures not be stipulated. Special instructions are given to each county to comply with this and are communicated to the provincial party headquarters.</p>
<p>The Provincial Land Administration Bureau was previously ordered to conduct registration of urban land in the provincial capital, which was supposed to be completed within four months. However, since this was the first time this had been done, the people were mostly hesitant to apply for property rights. Even those who had applied had incomplete procedures and required personnel to investigate to ensure accuracy. Verifying deeds and going back and forth took time. It coincided with the agricultural production season, and many people went out of the city to harvest. After more than three months, only half of the property owners had applied. If done hastily, not only would the people not be able to cope, but there would also be concerns that the office staff would make omissions. In addition, the provincial and municipal land must be measured using triangulation to comply with regulations. Therefore, it was difficult to complete the task within the four-month limit. The bureau requested the provincial government to extend the deadline by two months to expedite the work and ensure thoroughness. It is now learned that the provincial government, after receiving the report, has approved the request and ordered that the work be expedited.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: City River Dredging Completed</h3>
<p>The city river in the urban and suburban areas of this county was extensively dredged last year. Due to time constraints, the third section, from the Xiwai Water Gate Bridge to the Taoxing Bridge, was left unfinished. This section is the most prosperous commercial area, with densely packed residences. The riverbed was severely silted up. Therefore, the county government re-measured and planned to dredge the river, entrusting the First District Office to handle it. The district solicited bids, and Wu Xinji won the bid to undertake the project. The dredging was done in sections. The section from the Taoxing Bridge to the Malu Bridge was completed earlier, inspected, and the dam was opened for water flow. The completion of the sections from the Malu Bridge to the Chang Bridge and to the Xiwai Water Gate Bridge was originally scheduled for the 20th of last month. However, due to continuous heavy rain, water accumulated within the dam, requiring additional pumping. The project was quite large, causing a delay until yesterday. Merchants and residents urgently requested that the county government send personnel to inspect and accept the project and open the dam as soon as possible, as water was urgently needed in the summer. Magistrate Li, considering the situation, believed it to be true and immediately appointed the chief of the Third Section, Chen Xibin, to conduct an on-site inspection of the dredged river sections. The chief of the First District, Shen Fuyun, and the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Cheng, supervised the inspection, which was completed and opened at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Conducting Citizen Oaths</h3>
<p>The county-wide citizen oath registration has been earnestly handled by each district, which has instructed its affiliated township offices to do so. Each township has now set the dates for citizen oath registration from the 6th to the 10th. In recent days, a large number of citizens have gone to the registration offices to take the oath. Each district office must compile the name lists and report them to the county government by the 15th for the issuance of citizen certificates.</p>
<h3>Discovery of a Turtle with a Human Face</h3>
<p>This county has recently been plagued by continuous rain, causing deep water accumulation in the fields. On the afternoon of the 7th, Shen A-san, a farmer near Qingyang Port, discovered a turtle about eight inches long while working in the field after the rain. The turtle was unusually active in the field. Upon closer inspection, he found patterns resembling a mouth, nose, eyes, and hair on its back, exactly like a human face. A-san was very surprised upon seeing this and urgently called the surrounding farmers to observe. All believed it to be an ominous sign and immediately killed the turtle and threw it into the river.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Preparing for Zhang Taiyan's State Funeral</h3>
<p>After Zhang Taiyan passed away in Suzhou, the central government decided to hold a state funeral and appointed a preparatory committee. According to news from the funeral committee, Mr. Zhang's coffin will be buried in Hangzhou. Mrs. Zhang, Feng Guoli, visited Hangzhou once to inspect the burial site. The committee members will hold a meeting in Suzhou in early September to discuss matters related to the funeral. Jinfan Road, where Mr. Zhang's residence is located, was newly built last year and has no streetlights. The electric company has decided to install streetlights on the road within days to facilitate traffic, as the funeral is approaching. The funeral date is scheduled for mid-October.</p>
<h3>Recovering Huge Sums from Opium Paste Merchants</h3>
<p>The Lao Qiaoxing and other three opium paste merchants in Suzhou secretly increased opium prices, illegally collecting over 70,000 yuan in profits. The Provincial Anti-Opium Association learned of this and confirmed the facts. The county was ordered to recover the 70,000 yuan in illegal profits in full. The three opium paste merchants argued that the opium price increase was approved by the County Anti-Opium Association and was not a private increase, requesting exemption from payment. The province did not approve this and ordered the county to thoroughly recover the funds. Magistrate Deng, acting on the order, set a deadline of five days for each opium paste merchant to submit the full amount. The opium paste merchants were granted a three-day extension, which expires on the 10th. If the funds are not raised by the deadline, Magistrate Deng will implement the enforcement order, requiring the guarantors of each opium paste merchant to compensate the full amount. However, the opium paste merchants believe the amount is too large and are finding it difficult to raise the funds. In addition, the anti-opium committee members Zhang Yipeng and Liu Yun have been impeached by the Supervisory Envoy's Office, and Zhang and others have submitted a request for disposition.</p>
<h3>Changshu: New Court Selects Site</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court has included the issue of establishing a local court in this area in the budget for the 25th year of the Republic, making it certain to happen. Regarding the location, the Rule of Law Promotion Association advocates for renting the old county government buildings from the Hui family for continued use. The President of the High Court specially dispatched Secretary Shi Hanyun to Changshu to survey the site. As a result, it was determined that the old county government buildings were too old, difficult to repair, and reconstruction might conflict with private property. Therefore, it was considered that the New City God Temple (Zhaowen Temple) was the most suitable, and repairs and reconstruction could be determined based on the available funds. According to the county magistrate's opinion, it is proposed that the current county government be vacated and rebuilt at the library site, but requiring a subsidy of 20,000 yuan from the High Court. Secretary Shi has returned to Suzhou for instructions. If this is realized, the Changshu Local Court can be established within this year.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Chief Transferred</h3>
<p>Zhou Ding, the chief of the Public Security Bureau in this area, has held the position for two years. Recently, the provincial government decided in a meeting to transfer Zhou to the provincial government for appointment. Chen Yuchu, who was originally the chief of the Wuxi County Public Security Bureau, will be transferred to Changshu to succeed him. It is scheduled that Director Chen will come to Changshu on the 9th to take over and assume duties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Public Security Bureau Chief Changed</h3>
<p>Chen Yuchu, the chief of the Public Security Bureau in this county, received an order on the 7th to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau of Changshu. The vacancy will be filled by Zhang Da, the chief of the Public Security Bureau of Kunshan County. After receiving the news, Director Chen instructed his departments to complete the handover on the 8th and personally went to the province for instructions.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Water Recedes from Reclaimed Cotton Fields</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei coastal reclaimed area previously suffered from drought, but in the past half month, the weather changed, and heavy rain poured down. The low-lying fields of various companies became flooded. Fortunately, the weather has been clear for several days, and the water has drained quickly. The cotton seedlings in the reclaimed area have grown even better after this heavy rain.</p>
<h3>Busting a Drug Den in the Eastern Suburbs</h3>
<p>The detective team of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau busted a secret drug den selling drugs in the central town of the eastern suburbs on the morning of the 7th. Morphine was seized, and Sun Maoqi, Gu Guide, and Dong Liu, among others, were arrested on the spot and sent to the District Security Command for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou: Lu Chen Grain Stores Resuming Business</h3>
<p>The 45 Lu Chen grain stores outside the South Gate of this county closed down entirely due to the proposed increase of 0.5% in business tax by Zang Langxuan, director of the Business Tax Bureau, starting from August 1st. The stores believed that this would have a significant impact, and it was not implemented in neighboring counties. The closure lasted for three days, from the 2nd to the 4th, affecting the livelihoods of thousands of people. Xu Lianqing, Wang Weibai, and other standing committee members of the County Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, came forward on the 5th to mediate, initially collecting taxes at the old rate. They waited for Chairman Wang Hongzao to return to You and negotiate improvements with Director Zang. In the afternoon, the Grain Guild vigorously persuaded all the grain stores to resume business. However, due to the rainy weather, transactions were slow.</p>
<h3>Extreme Damage to Piled Wheat</h3>
<p>In the past ten days, this county has experienced continuous rain, and the large amount of wheat purchased in You by factories and firms in Shanghai and Tianjin could not be shipped out in time, piling up in the warehouses. As a result, it has become moldy and suffered extreme damage. Nan Mao Xin alone lost 60,000 to 70,000 shi of wheat. Other companies and firms have also lost 20,000 to 30,000 shi each.</p>
<h3>Huzhou: Car Drives Into the Lake</h3>
<p>The third passenger car on the Hangzhou-Changxing Road, carrying five passengers, departed from Hangzhou at noon on the 6th. At around 2:00 PM, the car reached the Yingshi Tomb near the Huzhou station. Due to the heavy rain in recent days, the water in the lake was level with the shore. The driver, due to a moment of carelessness, drove the car into the lake. After hearing the news, the Huzhou station immediately sent people to rescue the six passengers and the driver, sending them to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. After entering the hospital, three passengers were discharged immediately because they were not injured. The other three were also slightly injured and remained in the hospital for treatment. It is believed that there is no danger.</p>
<h3>Haizhou: One Bomb Kills Twelve People</h3>
<p>Jia Xingbang, an ironworker from the Ye Hai area on the border between Muyang and Suqian counties, usually sets up a furnace to cast and sell plowshares (i.e., farming tools) to meet the needs of rural areas. However, the materials he used were mostly scrap tin and old iron, etc., because the cost was lower. In the spring of this year, Jia went to Muyang County to buy scrap iron. He did not know that someone mistakenly sold several discarded bombs from the former 25th Route Army under the Tianhou Palace dam at a low price. Jia, tempted by the small profit, bought several bombs and carried them home. Initially, he planned to put them in the furnace to melt them for plowshares. Later, someone who knew about it said that there was gunpowder inside, which was too dangerous, and advised him to stop. However, Jia had exchanged money for the bombs and could not bear to throw them away, so he placed them at home and still wanted to find a way to take out the powder and melt it in the furnace. When Jia lit the furnace at noon the day before yesterday, he suddenly remembered the bombs he had previously stored at home, so he took them out and played with them, but he still dared not touch the fuse. Coincidentally, a neighbor, Chen, who had been an artilleryman for many years, was on the scene and claimed to have considerable experience in this area and was willing to remove the fuse. Jia was overjoyed and handed him iron pliers. Chen did not hesitate and used the pliers to remove the bomb's fuse. The crowd avoided each other to prevent an explosion. After a while, he successfully removed the fuse and threw the bomb on the ground. The crowd gathered again, no longer afraid because the previous bomb had been handled successfully. Everyone was watching closely to see how to use the pliers to remove the fuse. Unexpectedly, just as he was shaking the pliers, white smoke suddenly billowed out of the fuse. The crowd knew something was wrong and fled, but with a deafening sound, the bomb exploded, with bodies and bones flying all over the sky. Some had no limbs left, others had their heads blown off, and some had only one arm remaining. Chen, who was using the pliers on the bomb, had no remains left. It is estimated that twelve people were killed and four were seriously injured. It can be said to be a tragedy.</p>

<h3>Preparing for Citizen Registration and Oath-Taking: City Government Issues Regulations for Citizen Registration and Oath-Taking; National Assembly Election Office to Convene a Meeting of Various Agencies</h3>
<p>Citizen registration and oath-taking are fundamental conditions for obtaining any voting or eligibility rights in the National Assembly elections. Therefore, since the preparations for the National Assembly election have begun, citizen registration and oath-taking cannot be delayed or postponed. Given the unique local circumstances of this city, its dense population, and its status as a special district, in order to ensure rapid and efficient implementation, meticulous research is required based on official regulations. Consequently, the preparation process has been relatively time-consuming. According to news from the Municipal National Assembly Election Office, regarding this matter, the Municipal Government issued Instruction No. 19716 yesterday, promulgating the regulations. The office, recognizing the urgency, has decided to proceed expeditiously and has scheduled a meeting for relevant agencies and organizations at 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month to discuss all matters, in order to commence the process as soon as possible. The original text of the government instruction and regulations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Municipal Government Instruction</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Government Instruction No. 19716, issued to the Shanghai Municipal Representative Election Office for the National Assembly, states: Regarding the matter of citizen oath-taking and registration in this city, the Ministry of Interior has previously responded by telegram, instructing the Public Security Bureau to consult with your office on its implementation. We have duly issued instructions accordingly. As a result of consultations, a set of "Regulations for Citizen Registration and Citizen Oath-Taking in Shanghai Municipality" has been formulated to provide a basis for implementation. In addition to instructing the Public Security Bureau to assist your office in accordance with these regulations, a copy of the regulations is hereby issued to you for compliance. This instruction is issued.</p>
<p>Original Text of Regulations</p>
<p>Regulations for Citizen Registration and Citizen Oath-Taking in Shanghai Municipality: 1. Citizens of this city shall, in accordance with the legal age (20 years or older), fulfill citizen registration and citizen oath-taking (members of organizations shall have their organizations handle this on their behalf). 2. Citizen registration and citizen oath-taking in this city shall be conducted by district, according to the former administrative divisions (17 urban and rural areas) and two special districts. Each district shall be further divided into several locations for processing, based on the distance of roads and the density of households. 3. Due to the dense population and vast area of this city, it is impossible to complete citizen registration as scheduled without the joint efforts of all agencies and organizations. Therefore, the following agencies and organizations are designated to be responsible for implementation: (A) Municipal Party Headquarters and District Party Headquarters, (B) Boy Scouts Council, (C) Defense Committee, (D) Public Security Bureau, (E) Education Bureau, (F) Education Association, (G) Municipal Farmers' Association, (H) Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. 4. Although citizen registration in this city will be conducted jointly by various agencies and organizations, a system of division of labor and responsibility will be adopted to ensure smooth operations. Each organization will be responsible for designated areas. The allocation table will be determined separately. 5. The procedures for citizen registration and citizen oath-taking are as follows: A. The organization or agency responsible for an area shall distribute citizen registration forms to all residents in the area according to the prescribed date, instructing them to fill them out and keep them. B. Residents shall fill out the forms according to the prescribed date and submit them to the designated citizen oath-taking location, where they will take the oath simultaneously. C. At the oath-taking location, the oath administrator shall verify the citizen's registration form for errors and instruct them to make corrections, and then have them perform the oath-taking procedure. D. The oath administrator shall organize the citizen registration forms and oaths and submit them to the Municipal Election Office to create citizen certificates. E. After the citizen certificates are created, they will be distributed, or citizens will be instructed to collect them themselves. F. After the deadline for citizen registration and citizen oath-taking, the Election Office shall announce the results by district. If there are any omissions in issuance or registration, citizens in all areas shall be allowed to complete registration and take the oath on a designated date, limited to one day. G. The organization or agency responsible for distributing registration forms in a certain district shall report the name of its person in charge, the total number of team members, and the number of teams formed to the office for record-keeping. H. These regulations shall be implemented upon approval by the Municipal Election Supervisor.</p>
<p>Scheduled Meeting</p>
<p>The National Assembly Election Office yesterday sent letters to the Municipal Party Headquarters, District Party Headquarters, Defense Committee, Boy Scouts Council, Public Security Bureau, Education Bureau, Education Association, Municipal Farmers' Association, Federation of Trade Unions, etc., stating: Regarding the matter of citizen registration and oath-taking in this city, the Municipal Government has issued regulations to our office. We have scheduled a meeting of all organizations and agencies at 10:00 AM on the 12th of this month at our office, No. 107 Fenglin Bridge Municipal Government, to discuss all matters in order to facilitate implementation. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby request your office to investigate and ensure that representatives are sent to attend at that time.</p>
<h3>Applying to the Jianghai Customs: Deadline for Registration and Licensing Approaching - Limited to the 11th of This Month; Failure to Obtain License Will Affect Freight Transportation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's Anti-Smuggling Committee held its fourth executive committee meeting yesterday. Attendees included Ge Jiecun, Luo Qinghua, Yang Guanbei, Dong Zihua, Ge Weian, etc. The meeting was chaired by Ge Jiecun. The following cases were discussed: (1) Public associations for the candy and biscuit industry, silk industry, northern and southern goods exchange industry, transit industry, new drug industry, and woolen industry reported the establishment of anti-smuggling branches and submitted their regulations for record-keeping. The meeting resolved to approve the record-keeping. (2) The case of supplementing the deputy leaders of the inspection and communication groups was discussed. The meeting resolved to supplement Gan Tinghui as the deputy leader of the inspection group and Liu Minzhai as the deputy leader of the communication group. (3) The paper industry proposed to find a way to remedy the situation when non-smuggled goods are detained. The meeting resolved that the industry association should provide proof to handle the matter. (4) The second item of the regulations on the transportation of domestic goods stipulates that domestic goods transported inland that do not pass through customs should be reported to the relevant industry association or chamber of commerce, which will issue a certificate of domestic goods. The chamber of commerce should draft a format and notify all industries to print it. The meeting resolved to hand it over to the secretary to draft. The meeting then adjourned. Furthermore, in order to prevent the transportation and sale of smuggled goods, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that all relevant factories, businesses, transit companies, etc. must first register with the customs and obtain a license. When obtaining a license, the industry association or chamber of commerce must provide proof. In Shanghai, since the customs announcement, many have gone to register, but many have also neglected to do so. The regulations stipulated that applications for licenses must be made within twenty days of the local announcement. The announcement in this city was on June 23rd. After calculating the period, it will expire on the 11th of this month. Therefore, in recent days, there have been many requests to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations for proof to obtain licenses. The workload of the chamber has increased significantly. Those who have not yet completed this procedure are also encouraged to complete it before the 11th of this month to avoid delays.</p>
<h3>Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce Establishes National Goods Introduction Center</h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry sent letters to all national goods organizations in the city yesterday, stating: We previously received Instruction No. 44964 from the Ministry of Industry, based on Letter No. 713 from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, regarding the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce's request to establish a national goods introduction center in Singapore, instructing this bureau to consult with national goods manufacturers to carefully discuss and report back for approval. We copied the original request letter from the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and requested that you investigate and handle it. Many days have passed without a response. We are writing again to request that you promptly provide your opinions for submission to the ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications International Radio Station Broadcasts Important Domestic News to Facilitate Reception in the United States: Advance Broadcast Starting on the 11th</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications International Radio Station, in order to transmit domestic current events internationally, collects important news from various locations daily and broadcasts news telegrams via shortwave radio. Its messages are concise and rapid, and are highly regarded by various countries. It is now known that, in order to facilitate reception in the United States, the station will, starting on the 11th of this month, advance its broadcast to 00:30 midnight daily (16:30 Greenwich Mean Time). The call sign remains XGL, and the frequency is 797 OK0. The station has already submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications and consulted with the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward letters to various embassies and consulates abroad for notification.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Petitions Ministry of Finance to Unify the Design of Legal Tender and Request Provision of Machinery for Self-Printing</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation believes that since the Ministry of Finance implemented the legal tender policy, the original banknotes have been insufficient for circulation, leading to the alteration of various bank notes. The designs are not uniform, and authenticity is difficult to verify. The meeting resolved to petition the Ministry of Finance to reorganize and seek to print banknotes independently to recover profits. The original petition is recorded below: A petition is submitted for the matter of a petition. Since your ministry implemented the legal tender policy, it has received the support of friendly international nations and the endorsement of the domestic population. The financial market has been stabilized, and the industrial and commercial sectors have gradually improved. This is truly gratifying. However, with silver nationalized, circulation is limited to legal tender. Due to the complex issuance by the banking sector in the past, the banknotes used in the market are of various designs, presenting a chaotic and disorganized appearance. If counterfeit banknotes are mixed in by criminals, it is difficult to identify them. In addition, our country's banknotes have always been printed overseas, which is also a national loss. Therefore, the sixth executive committee of the association resolved: (1) to petition the Ministry of Finance to instruct the issuing banks to recall the old banknotes within a limited time; (2) to have the government raise funds to procure self-printing machinery to recover profits; (3) to centralize issuance with a uniform design and record it. It is reasonable to record this case and petition your ministry to separately review and implement it, which would be for the public good. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Huang Tianmin's Mission</p>
<p>The mission of Huang Tianmin, Director of the Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office, on this trip south is to establish an anti-smoking office in Guangdong.

<h3>Wenzhou and Taizhou New Rice Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wenzhou and Taizhou in Zhejiang Province are famous early rice producing areas. This year, the early rice harvest in Wenzhou and Taizhou was abundant, and the new rice began to be harvested at the end of last month. The first batch of goods, totaling more than 600 dan, has been transported to Shanghai for sale. According to news from the rice market, since the end of the Dragon Boat Festival this year, the price of rice has fallen by more than three yuan per stone. Merchants have suffered losses.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Zhabei Long-Distance New Radio Station: Talking Last Night with Special Features and Improved Compared to Previous</h3>
<p>According to the Daguang News Agency, after the installation of all new-style equipment at the Ministry of Communications Shanghai Telephone Bureau Zhabei Long-Distance New Radio Station was completed, continuous tests were conducted starting on the evening of the 4th of this month. The results of calls with domestic and foreign locations have been satisfactory. Yesterday morning, Director Xu visited the station for inspection. Then, engineers Yu and Huang, as well as branch chiefs Zhu and Fan, together with the resident supervisor, made preparations. The station was officially opened and put into use at 12:30 midnight yesterday, and call traffic was busy.</p>
<p>New Station Features: Connection and Contact</p>
<p>After the new long-distance telephone went into operation, the original old long-distance station was abolished. Because all the new station's sound receiving, speaking, and other equipment purchased from the United Kingdom are the latest models, the call traffic is greatly improved compared to the old station. From now on, the calls will have three special features: (1) The new station is equipped with a sound-amplifying pump telephone, which can increase the sound wave at any time when it is in use, which helps to lengthen the function of the radio wave. (2) The domestic long-distance lines and foreign lines that have been called are implemented through the same handover channel. The new station handles calls. (3) In the future, domestic and foreign calls at the new station, whether wired or wireless, can be directly connected, which can achieve the effect of receiving contact calls.</p>
<p>Chinese Settlement Calls: Four Connection Methods</p>
<p>The dialing method for calls at the new long-distance telephone station is as follows: Automatic machine users in the Chinese area who want to make domestic long-distance calls should first dial "40" and then call the other party's number (i.e., the called party). Concession users should first dial "02" to transfer to the long-distance station relay line to call. For foreign calls, concession users must dial "03." In the Chinese area, relay lines in Nanshi, Longhua, the city center area, and Zhenru transfer to the long-distance station to connect.</p>
<p>Installing Sound Amplifiers: Use Along the Line</p>
<p>In order to improve the call traffic between Beijing and Shanghai, the station, after the new long-distance telephone station was put into operation, specially selected and used booster motors along the Beijing-Shanghai route. The new telephone line between Beijing and Shanghai is laid along the highway, and the old line is laid along the railway. The two do not conflict.</p>
<p>Zhabei Public Station: Site Relocation</p>
<p>The Zhabei Telephone Branch recently submitted an application to the General Bureau, and it was approved by the technical meeting. The Zhabei public station that it set up will be moved to the "0" station to facilitate the concurrent management of night shift drivers.</p>

If it is found that there is a storage certificate without collateral, the management office shall bear full responsibility. (10) When the syndicate provides storage and sales loans, the syndicate shall handle all remittance transactions.

<h3>Guangdong Province Borrows Funds from Three Banks, Already Paid Directly by Guangdong Branches</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Guangdong Provincial Government seeking 6 million yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, secured by the province's tax revenue, in order to consolidate finances, a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency continued to inquire with banking circles in Shanghai yesterday. It was learned that Song Ziliang, the special financial commissioner and director of finance of Guangdong, flew from Shanghai to Guangdong on the 22nd of last month. In light of Chen Jitang's departure with a large amount of savings and tax revenue, making consolidation difficult, he consulted with Zhou Shouliang, deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, Bei Songsun, manager of the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China, and Tang Shoumin, general manager of the Bank of Communications, who had accompanied him. They negotiated a loan of 6 million yuan from the three banks, with 2.4 million yuan each from the Central Bank and the Bank of China, and 1.2 million yuan from the Bank of Communications, for the purpose of consolidating finances, secured by the province's tax revenue. At the end of last month, a contract was signed in Guangzhou with the Guangdong branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications. As for the Central Bank, it entrusted the Guangzhou branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications to handle the matter on its behalf. Now the funds have also been directly paid to the Guangdong Department of Finance by the branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications, so this loan is now a thing of the past.</p>

<h3>Special First District Court Trial Yesterday, Case of Counterfeiting Hubei Subsidiary Currency Bonds, Handwriting Authentication of Commission Letter, Liu Peiqing Temporarily Detained</h3>
<p>Lu Fangzheng, a Hubei native and former doctor, previously forged a commission letter from the Hubei Provincial Bank and other documents, and printed 1.5 million of the bank's subsidiary currency bonds at the Huadong Engraving Company, located at No. 25, Maoyi Lane, 153 Meibai Road. On July 19, the first 50,000 yuan was printed and loaded onto the Ruichangwan ship. However, when passing through Xiaguan, Nanjing, it was seized by the Jianghai Customs, who recognized it as counterfeit and confiscated it. Lu also fled. Now, Liu Peiqing, the owner of Huadong Engraving Company, reported the matter to the Xinzha Patrol House, and the head of the patrol house ordered detectives to arrest Lu and send him to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. This has already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Tan Xinzhen continued the trial in the eighth criminal division. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the patrol house clarified the case and stated that Liu Peiqing had also arrived in court today. Then, Mei Yu, a handwriting expert from the General Inspectorate of the General Patrol House, came to court to testify that the commission letter and other documents were written by one person, clearly indicating forgery. The patrol house also investigated the seizure of the 50,000 yuan subsidiary currency bonds with the Jianghai Customs. The Jianghai Customs sent a reply to the Nanjing Customs, stating that on July 19, three pieces of luggage were seized in the third-class cabin of the Ruiyangwan ship, containing four packages, which contained counterfeit subsidiary currency bonds with a face value of 50,000 yuan, and a seal of Jia Shiyi, the Director of the Hubei Department of Finance and the Manager of the Provincial Bank. The Hubei Provincial Bank also reportedly sent a telegram to the court, requesting a thorough investigation. Judge Tan summoned Liu Peiqing to court, questioned him, and, suspecting that Liu also had a significant connection to the crime, ordered Liu to be temporarily detained. The case was rescheduled for another hearing in seven days.</p>

<h3>Small Foreman Zhang Honggao Crushed to Death by Boiler in Company Building on Rue Luban; Death Deemed Accidental; Favored Foreign Firm Provides Compensation</h3>
<p>Zhang Honggao, a 27-year-old native of Qingjiang, worked as a small foreman in the machine engineering department of the French-owned Favored Foreign Firm. At 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, he led workers to the company building at 181 Rue Luban, intersection of Route Lafayette in the French Concession, to raise the water-cooled boiler that had been previously installed. Unexpectedly, the boiler, weighing approximately 2,600 pounds, shifted and toppled over as the workers were lifting one side due to the heavy weight. Zhang, who was standing nearby supervising, was crushed, sustaining injuries to his head and chest. He immediately lost consciousness. Efforts were made to lift him out and transport him to Guangci Hospital by car. However, he succumbed to his injuries en route and died. The body was then taken to the Tongren Foyuan branch mortuary for an autopsy. At noon yesterday, the French police reported the incident to Qiao Wanxuan, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who, along with a medical examiner, arrived at the mortuary to conduct an examination. It was determined that the death was caused by injuries sustained from being crushed. Zhang Zhoushi, the deceased's wife, was instructed to claim the body for burial. However, the deceased's family is poor. Friends and relatives raised funds for the funeral. The managers of Favored Foreign Firm, considering Zhang's tragic and accidental death, his young wife, and his young children, deemed it especially pitiable and agreed to provide a monthly allowance of 15 yuan for their sustenance.</p>

<h3>Entrusting License Leads to Firearm Falling into Bandit Hands</h3>
<p>Cheng Yanghan Entrusts Hua Jinsen; Hua Lends it for Robbery</p>
<p>Cheng Yanghan, a native of Pinghu and manager of the Tongji Pawnshop in Pinghu and the Jixing Pawnshop in Taicang, owned a handgun, number 466417, with a French Concession license but no Chinese Concession permit. In February of this year, Hua Jinsen, a Jiangbei native claiming to be a detective from the Public Security Bureau, approached Wan Tong Pawnshop on Hengfeng Road, boasted his connections, and, through the introduction of clerk Wang Zhongfu, obtained the handgun from Cheng to obtain the necessary permit. However, Hua lent the gun to bandits for robbery. The case was uncovered by the police, and Hua Jinsen was sent to the District Court by the Public Security Bureau for questioning. Yesterday, Prosecutor Xie summoned Cheng Yanghan to court for questioning. After taking his statement, he was dismissed and instructed to await further investigation according to the law.</p>
<h3>Yang Fuqing Denies Running Mirror Polishing Den</h3>
<p>Police Chief Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Yang Fuqing, a native of Taizhou, runs a wine shop at 3 Binde Lane, Qiujiang Hostel, 44 North Fourth Road, Hongkou. He is accused of secretly operating an illicit establishment where women are induced to engage in "mirror polishing" (a euphemism for prostitution). The case was discovered by the Inspection Department of the Public Security Bureau, who arrested Yang and confiscated rubber implements, forwarding him to the District Court on charges of obscenity. Yesterday, Judge Chen Kangsun opened the hearing. Yang Fuqing testified that he was 32 years old and had been running the wine shop since June 1st, only for half a month. He employed four female waitresses: Zhang Gendi, Jin Abao, Ni Fengying, and Zhang Abao. He denied operating a "mirror polishing" ring. When questioned about the evidence found, he replied that he was framed during an argument with Inspection Department personnel. At this point, Liang Zhangyou, the police chief of the Qiujiang Road Police Station, testified that the case was reported by Chen Sizhou, who led him and police officers to investigate. They saw rubber implements on the table downstairs, and six women and Yang Fuqing were present. They were all taken to the station. The arrest was carried out by investigators from the Special Affairs Section of the Public Security Bureau, based on instructions from our officer Ouyang Wei.

<h3>Wei Xudong Invents Chemical Steaming of Ramie for Textile Production</h3>
<p>Ramie textile is one of the main textile industries and is relied upon as a raw material for modern military supplies. Everything from daily necessities such as towels, drapes, blankets, clothing, etc., to materials such as airplane wings, parachute fabrics, belts, and fire hoses, is made from ramie fabrics. However, ramie textile production in China is still in its infancy, and we rely heavily on imports, resulting in alarming financial losses year after year. Mr. Wei Xudong, recognizing this problem, carefully considered it, researched it meticulously, and spent four years developing a method for chemical steaming of ramie and cotton, which can be spun into counts as fine as 180 (its raw ramie material comes from provinces such as Jiangxi, Hunan, and Sichuan, which are exceptionally abundant). The results are better than or equal to imported products. This has been jointly certified by spinning mills such as Shenxin, Yongan, Anle, Xiefeng, and Dingxin, as well as the China National Products Maintenance Association, the China Underwear Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and others. However, due to financial difficulties, a factory has not yet been established for production. Apart from speculative ventures, capitalists in general are mostly uninvolved with domestic product production, which benefits society and the country. Therefore, Mr. Wei, after inventing the ramie textile method and exhausting his energy and resources over several years, remains determined and refuses to be discouraged. However, his personal financial resources are running out. He has therefore submitted a request to the National Economic Council of the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and other high-level government agencies, requesting funding to establish a factory for production to benefit the people and stop financial losses. He has also submitted samples, certificates, and business plans as evidence.</p>

<h3>Lu Zongying Forges Stamps, Convinces of Aviation Lottery Tickets Confirmed, Also Swindles 2,000 Yuan in Security Deposits, Police Need to Investigate Further and Request Extension</h3>
<p>Lu Zongying, of the Hengtai Money Exchange at 20 Avenue Edward VII, a native of Zhenjiang, previously impersonated the Detai Cigarette Paper Shop, forged stamps, and swindled 500 aviation lottery tickets from the Dayun Company at 110 Avenue Edward VII, signing a Hengtai Money Exchange promissory note for 4,850 yuan dated May 8. When the company presented the note, they discovered that the money exchange had already closed down in the morning and declared liquidation. The Dayun Company reported the incident to the French police for investigation. On the 31st of last month, Detectives Tao Desheng and Zuo Qihong arrested Lu and handed him over to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details of this have been reported in this newspaper. During the adjournment period, it was discovered that the defendant used the name of Hengtai Money Exchange to swindle 2,000 yuan in security deposits from flour exchange broker Liu Shu, and also used a money exchange note to swindle 500 yuan in cash from Guo Jintang of the Yong'an Customs Brokerage at 4 Yong'an Lane, Yong'an Street. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Penghuan of the Special Court presided over a hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court to continue questioning Lu. The Police Department's lawyer Chen Ming stated the facts of the case, stating that the police were concerned that there might be more victims of the defendant's fraud, and requested an extension to conduct a detailed investigation before filing charges and seeking prosecution. When questioned, Lu Zongying confessed without denying. The court ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and granted an extension for further investigation before another hearing.</p>
<h3>Xu Wancheng's Bail Issue</h3>
<p>Suffering Greatly in Detention</p>
<p>Xu Wancheng has been detained for over two months for commenting on the theft of new-style handguns at the Shanghai District Court, etc. It is said that he is living in very poor conditions, suffering from ulcers on his feet, and his heart condition has also worsened, with occasional vomiting of blood and extreme suffering. Cai Yuanpei, Jiang Kanghu, Wang Bocai, Huang Jingwan, Wu Zhiqian, and dozens of others have requested the court to uphold justice and grant bail in accordance with the law, but to no avail. Based on legal principles, even if Xu is found guilty of both charges of obstructing official duties and defamation, the heaviest combined penalty would be a fine of only 1,100 yuan. A request for bail in this amount has been denied. Lawyers Wu Linkun and Ding Zheming have filed an appeal, and the High Court has ruled to overturn the District Court's denial of bail. A written request has been made to handle the matter fairly and expeditiously grant bail, but after half a month, there has been no response. It is said that enthusiastic members of the city's educational circles will make a second joint petition.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Collaboration for Music Textbooks</h3>
<p>The songs published by the Numing Society aim to arouse the spirit of national struggle. Now, Shanghai Municipal Shagang Elementary School (Pudong) requires the publication of two kinds of music textbooks. However, the songs in them are not those already published by the Society, but are all self-selected song titles such as "Watching the Sunrise, Praise of Sleep, Lullaby, Qing Tian Bai Ri Man Di Hong (Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Wholly Red Earth), The Moon Shines White, Happiness Like Gods in Heaven, Seeking Brother Song, March of the Volunteers, Qing Tian Bai Ri Song, March of the Army, Wild Goose, Bread." Therefore, the typesetting fee is over ten yuan, and the number of copies is only 80. The cost of paper (wood paper), printing, and binding is at least sixteen yuan (two jiao per copy). As for the students of the school, they can only afford one jiao at most. The Society is limited by funds and is in a dilemma. Therefore, it intends to seek cooperation with other schools, so that the more copies are printed, the lighter the cost will be, and the general children can afford it. If there are schools willing to adopt this as a music textbook, they can contact the Society at 132 Fangxie Road, Ximen.</p>
<h3>Chen Jianmin to Go to Europe</h3>

It is said that as soon as Chen agrees, he will be scheduled to go to the West.</p>
<h3>Who is the "Red Pill King" After All? Qian Zupei or Qian Guodong? Reopened Debate Concludes Again</h3>
<p>Qian Zupei, known as "Little Shandong" and the "Red Pill King," was previously arrested by the French police and handed over to the First Special Court in November 1932 for selling Lu Changfa's No. 11 Red Pills throughout the country and making a considerable profit. During the investigation, he was released on bail of 8,000 yuan in cash and then fled back to his hometown. Subsequently, the court ruled to confiscate his bail money and issued an arrest warrant. For four years, until recently, the French police discovered that Qian had secretly come to Shanghai and, together with the Laoza Gate police, arrested Qian at the Central Tea House on Guangxi Road and handed him over to the Second Special Court. The Police Department filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law. The case had already been tried and was scheduled for sentencing. However, the presiding judge, believing that the case still needed further investigation, ordered the cancellation of the closing arguments. All this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over a hearing in the First Criminal Court to interrogate Qian. Qian claimed that when he was arrested in 1932, he was summoned to the court, not arrested. He was questioned again, and Detective Fang Guilin, who handled the case, was summoned to testify. Fang testified that when he initially arrested Shi Yinbao, Wang Agen, and other red pill sellers, they claimed that their boss was Qian Guodong, known as "Little Shandong." Since Qian was well-known in Ruifuli, he went to arrest him. Without questioning him, he first handed him over to the court and then waited for further investigation. Unexpectedly, Qian escaped after being released on bail. Therefore, the police did not take a detailed statement from Qian at the time. Qian was questioned again, and the court ordered the closure of the arguments and scheduled the verdict for the 13th. The defendant remained in custody.</p>

Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Municipal Council explained the previous circumstances, stating that Jiang Axiao claimed at the police station that he had recently moved to 101 Dean Lane, Taopeng Road, and denied any involvement in the Taicang robbery case. It was confirmed that 101 Taopeng Road was where he had moved from Gaolang Bridge on the 6th of last month. Cai Fuquan, a detective from the Taicang Public Security Bureau, then presented an account of the incident. Jiang Axiao firmly denied the charges.

<p>Sheng Ada, the owner of the Shengtai cigarette paper store at 457 Bo Shi Road in the French Concession, a local resident, is fifty years old. He used to be a houseboy and in the twelfth year of the Republic (1923), he adopted a daughter named Xingzhen, who is now sixteen years old. She received elementary education and is of ordinary appearance. She usually helps with household chores and store affairs at home. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM on the 6th of this month, she suddenly disappeared without a trace. After reporting to the French Police, Sheng searched her belongings at home and found a love letter from someone in Xingzhen's chest. The original text reads, "Time flies like an arrow; six and a half months have passed in a flash. During this process, I feel very bored, but when I think carefully, there is endless happiness in sight. Calculating the days, our time is coming soon. Please be very secretive in everything. If you have anything, bring it when you have the chance. Please cherish money, we will need money soon, so don't waste it. I hope you take care of your health. I think of you when I lie in bed, and I wait on the balcony in the morning to see you open the door. I am very happy to see your beautiful figure. Please don't miss me. Goodbye, [Day], Love, [Sender]." Sheng then presented the letter to the police and requested an investigation. After investigation by detectives Jin Bingwen and Li Dedong, it was learned that Xiang Sanbao from Wuxi, who worked at the Xiesheng Fruit Store at 479 nearby, was suspected of abduction. Xiang was arrested and confessed to enticing Xingzhen and hiding her in Room 140 of the Mantingfang Yuelai Hotel, where they had intercourse once. Thereupon, detectives Jin and Li, together with the French police, went to the address and rescued the girl, bringing her back to the police station for her family to take home. Yesterday, Xiang was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. The prosecutor of the police department requested an extension of the investigation and then filed a complaint for trial. Judge Zhang Chaozuo reported to the authorities, stating that the case concerned public morals and forbade public attendance. After questioning the defendant and the victim, he ordered a postponement for further questioning on the 12th. The defendant was remanded in custody, and Xingzhen was ordered to be examined by the forensic department.</p>

<p>After the sudden joint strike of all employees of the China Credit Bureau on Yuanmingyuan Road on the 7th, bank representatives such as Kong Shouheng mediated tirelessly. Finally, at 5:00 PM yesterday, both parties reached a settlement. All employees are scheduled to resume work tomorrow. The details, as investigated by a Dagongshe reporter, are as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Process</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the joint employee strike, representatives from various banks, including Shanghai Commercial Bank, Xinhua Xingye Bank, China Bank, and Overseas Chinese Bank, went to the bureau to convene a meeting with all employees to conduct mediation. However, due to the wide divergence of opinions between the two sides, the meeting ended without any result. Subsequently, Kong Shouheng, the deputy manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, continued to be responsible for mediation. The employees immediately selected Li Baimeng, Yao Dayan, Shen Zhijing, and three others as representatives. As a result of mutual consultation, Mr. Kong presented the conditions proposed by the employees to the board of directors for consideration and implementation in order to resolve this dispute as soon as possible.</p>

Once they are satisfied, the representatives will immediately notify all employees and workers to resume work on Monday.</p>
<h3>Philanthropic Road Morgue: Two Bodies Examined Yesterday</h3>
<p>One is Le Bao Bao, Burned, One is Wang Zixiang, Hanged</p>
<p>Le Liu, a 28-year-old woman from Yancheng residing at No. 116, Lane 149, Moganshan Road, was sleeping in a small room above the kitchen stove in the house with her four-year-old son, Bao Bao, last night. Unexpectedly, at around 1:00 AM this morning, the bed curtains suddenly caught fire, burning the woman and the child. Fortunately, it was discovered early, preventing a widespread fire. When the fire brigade arrived after receiving the alarm, the fire had already been extinguished. After receiving the report, the Putuo Road Police Station ordered detectives to investigate. It was learned that a candle had been lit beside the bed where the woman was sleeping. It was possibly played with by the child, causing it to fall onto the curtain. The woman and her son were sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The woman only suffered minor burns on her arms, so she left the hospital after being bandaged and medicated. However, the child, due to his young age and more severe injuries, could not be saved and soon died. Wang Zixiang, a 23-year-old man from Shaoxing, was originally an assistant in the kitchen of the Danghu Hotel at No. 9, Shanxi Road. Recently, due to extreme financial difficulties, he had a sudden suicidal thought. He went to Room 27, which was specially set aside by the hotel, and hanged himself while no one was paying attention. At around 1:00 PM, the tea attendant discovered him and quickly tried to untie him, but he was already barely breathing. The local Lao Zha Police Station was notified, and an ambulance was called to the scene. He was rushed to Renji Hospital, but treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. The above two bodies were both taken to the Philanthropic Road Morgue by the respective police stations. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, the prosecutor of the First Special Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan, clerk Wang Zuyi, and others, arrived at the morgue to examine the bodies and confirm their identities. They then ordered the respective families to sign statements and claim the bodies for burial.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department Orders Crackdown on Street Prostitutes, Yesterday's Letter Responds to City Federation's Inquiry</h3>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation previously received reports from the Hubei Road, Edward Road, and other district branches that every evening, as the lights came on, prostitutes lined the streets, forcibly pulling pedestrians, preventing merchants and residents from moving forward.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Rejects Request for Reduction of Raw Material Import Tax for Enamel Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Enamel Industry Trade Association, citing the sluggish market and declining business, presented a request to the Ministry of Finance last month to approve a reduction in the import tax on various raw materials to maintain the industry. Yesterday, the association received a reply from the Ministry of Finance stating, "We have received your submission regarding the request to reduce the import tax on various raw materials used in enamelware to reduce costs and maintain the industry due to poor business conditions. After the Ministry referred the matter to the National Tariff Commission for investigation, it was found that the current tax rates on various foreign raw materials used in the manufacture of enamelware are not high compared to the general import tax rates for raw materials. Therefore, your request to reduce the import tax on various raw materials used in enamelware cannot be approved. As for the refund of raw material taxes on enamelware sold abroad, there are also many obstacles. However, the Ministry has recently promulgated the Regulations on Customs Warehouses for Manufactured Goods and ordered the Jianghai Customs to conduct a pilot program. The customs warehouse system is designed to facilitate various manufacturing industries that use imported raw materials and promote foreign trade. You should order the industry to organize enamelware manufacturing institutions and apply directly to the Jianghai Customs for processing to reduce costs and facilitate exports. You are hereby informed."</p>
<h3>Native Cloth Industry Requests Exemption from Native Cloth Tax in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian Regions</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, asking that the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian unified tax bureaus be instructed to abolish the supplementary tax on handmade native cloth. The submission states: "Regarding the request for your ministry to order the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian regional unified tax bureaus to abolish the supplementary tax on handmade native cloth to maintain the established case. The national government decided in 1927 to exempt domestic handmade native cloth from tax, referring to the established case of 1918 and explicitly ordering the exemption. The reason for this exemption was that the national government, considering that both the supply and demand sides were poor people, exempted the tax before the abolition of the likin tax to promote domestic products. In 1930, when the cotton yarn unified tax was established, customs export tax receipts were required for verification. However, these native cloth weavers are all poor people with limited purchasing power. Merchants collect small amounts and consolidate them into large quantities, so how can they obtain tax receipts for verification? Based on the principle of one tax per item, the tax has already been levied at the source. Moreover, since there is an explicit order for exemption, there should be no doubt about levying the tax again. The association, based on these reasons, has made detailed submissions. Subsequently, your ministry approved and ordered the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui unified tax bureaus to issue special "transportation joint soil" certificates, allowing tax-free export. In the same year, Liaoning Province forcibly levied a supplementary tax, detaining goods and harassing merchants. The association again submitted a request to stop this, and your ministry ordered the Liaoning Provincial Department of Finance to forward the order to return the detained goods and exempt the tax. Historically, the three northeastern provinces have been the main sales area for this native cloth. Now, Guangdong and Guangxi have become the sole sales area, although they are less than three-tenths of the three provinces. However, on the shipping route, there is an opportunity to indirectly extend it to foreign countries. This year, the Dutch East Indies authorities have set import restrictions. The association wrote to the Shanghai International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, requesting that it send letters to foreign ambassadors and consular commercial officers, asking the Dutch East Indies authorities to exempt Chinese native cloth from import restrictions. The Trade Bureau also submitted a request to the Ministry, asking the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward an order for negotiations. The reply from the Dutch authorities indicates that there is room for change. Therefore, the association joined the Nanyang Industrial Investigation Group organized with the assistance of the Ministry of Industry, selecting merchants familiar with foreign conditions to act as representatives for investigation, hoping to achieve satisfactory production and sales cooperation. Furthermore, in this extravagant era, with other goods filling the market, the local people in various provinces and overseas Chinese are happy to purchase this native cloth because it is durable and of better quality than other goods. This is not only the case, but the people's patriotism is also the effect of the government's tax exemption and promotion. The association only seeks to reduce costs by one point, which can increase sales by one point, as an aid to rural areas. Recently, the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to Shanghai to gather opinions from manufacturers to promote domestic cloth. The association has already sent sample cloths to the Ministry of Industry for review. Furthermore, the supplementary tax levied in Guangdong Province can still be recovered for machine-made products in Shanghai, but this native cloth has a "tax-free independent transportation special certificate" that clearly states that the tax cannot be refunded. In this regard, native cloth is subject to a heavy tax due to the tax exemption. Considering this matter repeatedly and considering it in light of the principle of one tax per item, it seems that this supplementary tax should not be levied. Moreover, the native cloth business tax in various provinces and cities has therefore been uniformly exempted. In the past, it was possible to speak of self-government in the provinces, but today, when your ministry orders the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian regional unified tax bureaus to reorganize tax collection, all seven types of goods, including cotton yarn, which have already paid the unified tax, must not be taxed again to comply with the principle of one tax per item. At this time when all merchants are celebrating, if the association remains silent, it will not only fail in its duties, but also fail to live up to our government's repeated orders to promote domestic products and attach importance to rural areas. I hereby respectfully state that the handmade native cloth, which has been explicitly exempted from tax, has already paid the tax before it becomes a woven product. Due to the above reasons, the cotton products directly produced from cotton yarn do not have tax receipts for verification. Your ministry approved and ordered the issuance of special "soil" transportation joint certificates, which cannot be refunded. For several years, the association has been silently suffering a heavy tax. We are restating the reasons again to provide for your consideration. We respectfully request that your ministry review and verify the established case of exempting handmade native cloth from tax, and order the Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian regional unified tax bureaus to abolish the supplementary unified tax and the Guangxi military donation bureau's military donations. We respectfully wish the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on behalf of tens of thousands of weavers and poor people. Attached are one copy each of the supplementary tax bill from Guangdong Province and the military donation bill from Guangxi Province, as well as two original transportation joint certificates. Shanghai Native Cloth Industry Association."</p>

<h3>Representative of the Sino-Foreign Relief Association Welcomed by Overseas Chinese in Los Angeles</h3>
<p>The China Sino-Foreign Relief Association, located at 505 Honan Road, previously intended to report on past relief efforts to overseas Chinese in various ports and to elaborate on the essential points of construction for disaster relief, in order to gain sympathy. Taking advantage of Mr. Baker and Mr. Luo Chuanhua's trip to the United States, they were specially commissioned to serve as representatives to carry out publicity. The two gentlemen set off separately and received warm welcomes from overseas Chinese in Japan, Honolulu, and other places along the way. After leaving Honolulu, Mr. Luo arrived at the port of Wenangdeng in the United States on the 9th of last month aboard the mail ship "Mai Luoluo", and then went to Los Angeles, the film production area. The local Consul Mr. Jiang Yisheng went to the port to meet him and provided warm hospitality. He also introduced Mr. Zhao Baoguang, a leader of the overseas Chinese community, to meet and talk with him. Mr. Zhao is the president of the Chinese Charity Federation in the city. He deeply admired Mr. Luo's mission on this trip. The next day, he gathered representatives from all walks of life to hold a meeting to welcome him. Mr. Luo gave a detailed report on the relief work and construction projects over the years. Those who heard it sympathized and were willing to assist. That evening, a banquet was held to welcome him.

Mr. Luo stayed in the city for three days and left by train for Chicago on the 12th of this month. It is reported that he will meet with Mr. Baker and then go to various ports in the eastern United States to vigorously promote their cause.</p>
<h3>Sanlin School Principal Ding Guanyan Paints to Aid School Construction</h3>
<p>The Gymnasium is Solemn and Grand</p>
<p>Since Mr. Ding Guanyan took over as the principal of Sanlin School in Pudong, not only has the school's spirit improved day by day, but also its material construction has yielded results every year. The school has achieved excellent results in establishing a vocational high school, raising funds to build the Wen Yi Library, adding classrooms, and arranging gardens. The school's affairs are thriving, and it has received commendations from provincial and county supervisors. The reporter recently heard that the school is also building a gymnasium. Yesterday, I made a special trip to visit and saw Mr. Ding with his sleeves rolled up, dipping his brush and ink at his desk, creating a large finger painting of a central hall. His enthusiasm was overflowing, and his artistic conception was vivid. Mr. Ding had studied under Xie Gongzhan of Dantu and Chen Jia of Yushan, and was a disciple of Mr. Lu Lianfu. His finger paintings have opened up new paths, swiftly entering the realm of the ancients. Because he usually paints for leisure, he never takes payment. Therefore, those who know him regard obtaining even a small piece of his work as a treasure. However, Mr. Ding has always been busy with school affairs, and the requests for paintings have accumulated, leaving him no time to sort them out. Therefore, some people have not been able to obtain his paintings for several years. It is said that now, because the school's gymnasium is about to be completed and is heavily in debt, and future equipment is also quite lacking, he intends to make a vow to create one hundred paintings starting from now, with a price of fifteen yuan per four-foot central hall, including mounting, and twenty yuan per five-foot central hall, including mounting. He will issue pre-sale tickets, painting after payment, and all proceeds will be used to help equip the gymnasium. Buyers will also have their names engraved in stone to achieve immortality. It is believed that local people, who are enthusiastic about education, will not only help with construction but also obtain famous paintings and leave their names for posterity, achieving three goals in one stroke, and will definitely be happy to support him. Later, Principal Ding also led a tour of the gymnasium. The scale is grand, magnificent, and beautiful. It is currently under construction and will be completed soon. It has a total of seven buildings, divided into upper, middle, and lower three floors, with a total area of 3,640 square feet. The lower floor has a standard basketball court, a lecture platform, changing rooms, equipment rooms, etc. The middle floor is a grandstand that can accommodate more than 400 spectators. The upper floor is a student dormitory. It requires a total of 15,600 yuan. In addition to the 2,000 yuan donated by Mr. Kang Xitao from this town and more than 1,000 yuan donated by local people, and the appropriation of construction funds from previous years, there is still a shortfall of more than 10,000 yuan, all of which is the school's debt. Therefore, they sincerely hope that the local community will provide more support to make the facilities more perfect.</p>

<h3>World Games Basketball Qualifying Tournament: Our Team Defeats France Yesterday; American Team Maintains 40 Seconds in the 400-Meter Relay; World Record in Women's 100-Meter Freestyle</h3>
<p>Berlin Electric: At 5:00 PM on the 8th of the Games, the Sino-French basketball qualifying tournament was held, resulting in a score of 45 to 38, with China winning. (Central News Agency Correspondent's Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The World Games swimming competition was held here this morning. The preliminary results are sufficient to prove that the swimming championship will be contested by the United States and Japan. In the past four years, both countries' teams have made unparalleled progress. (National News Agency Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<p>Central News Agency World Games Correspondent's Berlin Broadcast: The track and field championships of the World Games are held separately for each event. In the men's category, the United States won 8 championships, Germany 3, Finland 2, and the United Kingdom, Japan, and New Zealand 1 each. In the women's category, Germany 2, the United States 1, and Italy 1. In the ball games, Norway won against Germany 2-0, and Italy won against Japan 8-0 today. Basketball has entered the second round. The results of the past games are as follows: Estonia beat France 34-29, Chile beat Turkey 30-16, Switzerland beat Germany 25-18, Czechoslovakia beat Hungary 2-0, Egypt beat Peru 35-22, Latvia beat Uruguay 20-17, Canada beat Brazil 24-17, Italy beat Poland 44-29, and Mexico beat Belgium 32-9. Japan beat China 35-19. During the Sino-Japanese basketball game yesterday, our overseas Chinese and students in Europe paid close attention. About 4,500 to 4,600 overseas Chinese went to watch and organized cheering squads to cheer and support, creating a strong atmosphere. Before the game, our team members all thought they could win. However, the Japanese spirit of hard work is truly admirable. Recalling the Far Eastern Games, it was common for our basketball team to overcome Japan. Now that we have received this lesson, we should strive forward and practice diligently in the future. During the game, our forwards were still active, taking advantage of opportunities. However, the poor shooting accuracy and missed free throws were the main reasons for the failure. The team members were too eager to win, which inevitably led to chaos, resulting in inaccurate shooting. According to statistics, our country had 16 free throws, but only made 2. Japan had 17 free throws against us, making 15. The ratio is very far apart, and the focus of the loss is also here. In other shooting aspects, the Japanese team is not superior to us. I hope our countrymen will learn from this lesson and work hard in training. This afternoon, we will have a simple elimination match against the French team.</p>

<h3>Records of Accompanying the World Games Delegation (Letter 7) Special Correspondent Feng Youzhen from the Central News Agency</h3>
<p>Cairo Museum</p>
<p>At half-past eight, a guide took us to an ancient palace, the palace of the 12th-century Sultan Saladin. Due to its age and repeated troop deployments, some of the buildings had already collapsed. The palace was built on top of a small hill, commanding a high position and overlooking the entire city. It is now occupied by the British army and has been converted into a fortress. As we walked to the top of the hill, the sound of military bugles filled the ancient palace with an aura of ferocity.</p>
<p>The architecture of the palace is naturally magnificent. Although it has been repeatedly ravaged by war, the remaining parts have been cleaned up and are still very tidy. The guide led us to the back of the palace, and looking out, we had a panoramic view of the entire city, further highlighting the importance of the small hill's terrain. He gave me a brief explanation of the situation in Cairo. To the left is the area where Muslims live. It is said that according to Islamic customs, after people die and are buried underground, houses are built on top of them, so Cairo can be said to be a city where the living and the dead live together. To the right is the area where white people live, with tall and orderly buildings and shady trees, the scenery is quite beautiful. A very long aqueduct has been built along the Nile River, and all the water used by the city is drawn in through this aqueduct. The bottom of the aqueduct is made into semi-circular wide holes, just like a long bridge, which is quite spectacular. To the right of the palace is a mosque, a relic of the 15th century, with a huge dome that fully expresses a solemn atmosphere. After enjoying the panoramic view of Cairo from the back of the palace, we hurried to the museum at half-past nine.</p>
<p>The Egyptian Museum was built in 1900 and is only thirty-six years old. Inside, it is filled with antiquities related to Egyptian culture. Before this museum was built, these antiquities were kept in the old museum. The new museum has magnificent architecture and is a one-story building. Our first impression when we walked in was that the order was very good. We didn't see any police or guards at the entrance, but Egypt has never had any cases of theft or loss of antiquities. The Egyptians have truly regarded these antiquities as national treasures, as the crystallization of national culture, and no one harbors selfish intentions to take them as personal treasures. Everyone who enters to visit must first buy a ticket, five piastres (about one shilling) per person, and enter in order from a revolving door. All the antiquities are displayed in an orderly manner, so that visitors can appreciate them in a very systematic way.</p>
<p>Our guide is a Jew who is well-versed in the history of Egyptian culture. His name is Charles Coldhabar. He has lived in Egypt for thirty years, speaks twelve languages, and explains the important antiquities in detail, endlessly, with a dry tongue and chapped lips, and sometimes with a humorous tone, which makes us laugh.</p>
<p>The antiquities displayed in the museum range from the pre-dynastic period of Egypt to the last dynasty (the Thirtieth Dynasty), and can be said to have been collected without omission. If you want to do a detailed study, you have to ask an archaeological expert to spend several years or even decades. We only took an hour to take a quick look, so of course we can't talk about any insights. I can only give the readers a brief introduction based on the most important antiquities that the guide explained to us.</p>
<p>The museum downstairs displays many stone statues of Egyptian emperors, various idols, and stone coffins of emperors. These are all relics from thousands of years ago. The carvings are extremely exquisite and show the beauty of ancient Egyptian art, which is worthy of being the originator of Western culture.</p>
<p>What attracted our attention the most was the gold coffin and mummy of Tutankhamun displayed upstairs. Tutankhamun was the king of the Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt, around 1555 BC. His gold coffin and mummy were excavated from his pyramid by British archaeologist Dr. Howard Carter with the permission of the Egyptian government. It was in 1922, only fourteen years ago. At that time, newspapers around the world published many detailed texts and photos about the excavation process and its results, which can be said to have caused a sensation. It is said that when the emperors of Egypt died, they all carried a curse: whoever went to excavate his tomb would not die well. It is said that the workers who participated in this excavation did not end well, and Dr. Carter also went mad and committed suicide for no reason. Whether such a legend is far-fetched or not, the reporter is not an archaeologist and does not need to verify it. However, his excavation of this ancient tomb has made a great contribution to the history of Egyptian culture, which is beyond doubt. Tutankhamun's coffin is three-dimensional in shape, with a door on each layer and a hidden lock on it. The outside of the gold coffin is inlaid with many jewels and carved with many patterns. It is truly exquisite. The outermost layer is about fifteen feet wide, and the other layers are smaller than each other. They were originally nested inside, but now they are displayed separately in large glass cabinets. A total of 225 kilograms of gold were used, one small piece of which is now found to contain copper. The guide said humorously, perhaps the workers at the time were embezzling. Tutankhamun's tomb is not the largest one in the pyramids. If the tombs of Danbos or Chephren were excavated, the greatness of their gold coffins would be even more amazing.</p>
<p>The emperors of Egypt believed in eternal life, so after they died, they applied specially made spices to their bodies, which could never rot. Only the heart could not be preserved, so it was dug out after death and replaced with a stone heart. These corpses are called mummies and have indeed been preserved for thousands of years, still as complete as if they were alive. I think modern scientists and pharmacists will also sigh that they are not as good as the ancient Egyptians who invented this preservative.</p>
<p>The mummy of King Tutankhamun is also displayed in the museum and cannot be visited. This golden body was cast according to the shape of the mummy. Not only are the body, hands, and feet completely in line with the mummy, but also the appearance, eyebrows, and eyes are no different from the real thing. It is lifelike. The golden body is also decorated with many precious patterns, and the craftsmanship is ingenious. Even the works of modern sculptors are far from comparable. There are three layers to the golden body, which are also nested one on top of the other, and then placed in the gold coffin.</p>
<p>Because of their belief in eternal life, the Egyptian emperors not only used preservatives to preserve their bodies, but also brought many treasures into the coffin. The treasures excavated from King Tutankhamun's coffin are all rare and precious, and there are too many to count. The most interesting thing is that the ancient Egyptians not only believed that the emperors were their masters in life and their gods after death, and were willing to serve their emperors for life, but also believed in the theory of eternal life and wanted to take advantage of their emperors' blessings and follow them to eternal life. They could not build pyramids, let alone use preservatives to preserve their bodies, so they came up with the idea of carving their models out of stone and burying them in the emperor's coffin. These stone statues are only a little over a foot long and are also very exquisitely carved. The stupidity of the ancient Egyptians can also be seen.</p>
<p>In addition to Tutankhamun's mummy, the museum also displays two mummies, I don't know which two emperors they are. Both of them are in wooden shells. Not only has the wooden shell not rotted, but one of them has five toes exposed, no different from a person who has just died. In a glass cabinet, there are rows and rows of gemstone rings, estimated to be one or two thousand in total. These were all worn by the emperors of the past, with the names of the emperors engraved on them. All the rings of the Egyptian emperors have been collected inside, without any missing. According to the guide, if anyone were to take a ring away, it would be like tearing a page from the entire history of Egyptian culture. But these rings, displayed in the glass cabinet, will never be missing.</p>
<p>In another glass cabinet is a queen's feather fan, also an antiquity from 3,500 years ago. The feathers are clearly visible, I really don't know what method they used to preserve them. The fan handle is installed horizontally, and when in use, it can be turned into a circle. She can also be said to have thought about the way to enjoy herself very thoughtfully.</p>
<p>There are too many other precious antiquities to see and write about. Due to time constraints, we left the museum at half-past ten with infinite regret and went to the Cairo train station.</p>
<p>Port Said on the Suez Canal</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, we boarded the train from Cairo to Port Said, bidding farewell to this lovely ancient capital. From Cairo to Port Said is about 200 miles, and both railway and highway are accessible. The railway is double-track and takes four hours to reach. Along the way, except for a very small part that can be cultivated, the rest is a sea of yellow sand. When the train speeds forward, yellow sand and coal ash fly in through the windows, and everyone almost becomes a Negro. The train travels for about an hour and then runs parallel to the Suez Canal. Before we went to Cairo, we thought that if we visited the ancient capital of the birthplace of Western culture, we would not be able to appreciate this great man-made canal. But as a result, we had both fish and bear's paw, and our joy could not be added. Before the Suez Canal was opened, Eurasian traffic had to detour through Africa. Now that the Suez Canal has connected the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, the voyage between Europe and Asia has been shortened by an unknown amount. Such a great project, compared with the Great Wall of China, which was only for defending against the Huns and maintaining personal foundation, its value is incomparable. The Suez Canal was started in 1859 by Ferdinand Delesseps, a Frenchman, and after an unknown amount of hardship, it took ten years to complete in 1869, at a cost of 200 million yuan. It was originally owned by France and Egypt, but later most of the shares were bought by England, and now the power is completely in the hands of England. When the train is running parallel to this great river, we look at the river body, which is full of turquoise water and more than 100 yards wide, not only marveling at the greatness of its engineering, but also feeling its charming tranquility, adding infinitely lovely scenery to the monotonous desert. At 3:00 PM, the train arrived in Port Said, and the mail ship had arrived an hour earlier. Port Said is a city belonging to Egypt, located on the Mediterranean Sea, at the northern end of the Suez Canal, and its location is extremely important. When Leser opened the canal, the British governor of Egypt, Mohommed Said, strongly supported it, so he named this place Port Said (also known as Port Said) to commemorate his achievements. After we got off the train, many people were still interested in touring, so they took cars to tour the city. The reporter was rushing to send a letter, and the post office was very close to the port, so he first took a motorboat back to the ship.</p>
<p>In the places the reporter has been to, the disorder, chaos, cunning, and shamelessness of the people, have probably never been greater than in Port Said. When the reporter returned to the mail ship and landed again, because the motorboat prepared by the company failed to sail on time, he and Mr. Hao Gengsheng hired a commercial motorboat together. The price was clearly stated as one shilling for both of them, but after landing, the boatman insisted on one shilling per person. No matter how you argued, he always defied his conscience, thickened his skin, and refused to admit it. Finally, the reporter asked him to guarantee with his national personality that he was not ripping them off, but he would rather disregard the country's reputation and insisted on this shilling. We didn't have time, and it wasn't worth arguing with him about this small matter, so we could only laugh and accept this ripoff.</p>
<p>According to people who have toured Port Said, no matter where you go, there are always many idlers who ask you to go here and there to buy this and that, and even pull you around and entangle you endlessly. There are many locals on the street who openly sell obscenities, and there are also many who ask you to watch nude dances and erotic films. Everyone can only politely decline. At half-past four, everyone took the company's motorboat and left this filthy city, returning to the mail ship. At half-past five, the ship set sail and exited the mouth of the Suez Canal, continuing forward towards the Mediterranean Sea. Looking back at the great bronze statue of Leser standing on the bank of the Suez Canal, fantasizing about the hardships and difficulties he encountered in opening this great river, I couldn't help but burst into admiration.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Has a Slow Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to apparent changes in the environment, the morale in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange fluctuated again. Long positions gradually emerged, but retail investors continued to absorb them enthusiastically. The rumors of a new public bond offering became increasingly intense. The market price showed a slow downward trend. The opening price yesterday was due to major players selling off, causing E bonds to fall sharply by six to seven jiao, which was due to the lack of a fall the previous day. Class A paper fell slightly by two jiao, but this was offset by the larger fall on the previous day, resulting in an even exchange. In the subsequent trading, retail investors absorbed the most, with 21 and 54 buying the most. Sellers remained 4, 5, 11 and 16. 44 also began to sell.

Profiteers covered their positions, resulting in a rebound. However, most people believe that new cotton will be arriving soon, and the future looks bearish. However, the price of marked yarn is lower than the price of spot yarn. Japanese merchants have already covered their short positions this month, so the market has turned from negative to positive.</p>
<p>Forward Yarn Rises by More Than One Yuan</p>
<p>The opening price of marked yarn in the morning continued the weak sentiment from the previous day and continued to decline. The August contract almost broke the 200 yuan mark, and all months fell by three to four jiao. The price for the January contract rose by three jiao. In the second round of trading, prices suddenly rose, and the trend turned bullish.

<h3>Waiting for US Cotton Estimates to be Released; Cotton Market Deals Straight Transactions</h3>
<p>The cotton market's old cotton is still weak and sluggish, and morale is low. New cotton is selling at a lower price, and few are interested in old cotton. The market price has fallen. Due to the US cotton government's estimate to be released tomorrow, the forward market is still stable, and profiteers are covering their positions. At the same time, the yarn market is improving, which is driving up the cotton market.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Old Falls and New Rises</p>
<p>The marked cotton market opened in the morning. US cotton was dull and unremarkable, rising one to four pounds. Indian cotton was also dull and lackluster, falling 0.5 rupees. The Osaka Three Products cotton rose by three to four jiao. The market morale was mixed. Old cotton in August was very sluggish because the new cotton situation was good, and manufacturers were taking a wait-and-see attitude. However, when new cotton was traded, Changhe and Shengyuan purchased a large amount, and the market became slightly tight. All months rose by five cents to one and a half jiao. After the second trading session, the yarn market was good, and the market was calm. Due to the estimate to be released tomorrow, those who are generally cautious are making straight deals overnight and must wait for tomorrow to see the results. As a result, all months rose by one and a half to two jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, except for August, which fell by one jiao. It was found that 3,000 dan of Jifeng were sold, 5,700 dan of Huofu, 3,700 dan of Yuda, 3,600 dan of Hexing, 2,100 dan of Changyu, 2,800 dan of Yichang, 4,700 dan of RunKang, 1,000 dan of Yongchang, and 2,000 dan of Xincheng. 2,100 dan of Dafeng were purchased, 1,900 dan of Mingde, 1,500 dan of Yuan Yi, 1,400 dan of Xiecheng, 1,700 dan of Hengchang, 4,300 dan of Shengyuan, 1,300 dan of Tonghe, 5,000 dan of Changhe, and 1,400 dan of Yuanxingchang.

<p>New Taicang Cotton, 46.30, 80 bales of Sulun factory entered, and the factory will be sent in September and October.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Closes Slightly Firm; Three Products Yarn and Cotton Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with prices for all months ranging from unchanged to down three pounds. Traders were waiting for the government report. Prices fell due to negative European political situation and long positions liquidation. There were not many sellers, and the market was small. Later, due to the hot and dry weather in Oklahoma, traders limited priced purchase, but there was a significant shortage of new buyers. At the close, the market was dull but firm. Spot prices rose two pounds, and futures prices rose one to four pounds. British spot cotton rose three points, and futures rose four points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to long position liquidation but rebounded due to purchases by European exporters. Pingguo Er and Aomula were unchanged, while Bailuoxi fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupees.

<h3>New Cotton Factory Demand is Very Strong</h3>
<p>In the recent two weeks, the price of October marked cotton has dropped straight from 45.1 yuan to 40.05 yuan, a difference of 4.6 yuan. The US Cotton Planting Area Report was published, and there was a period of excitement, which soon turned downstream, breaking the 1.2 cent mark. At the same time, Japanese merchants estimated that China's cotton fields had greatly increased, and production had surged, exceeding 15 million dan, which is a huge increase of 5 million dan compared to the Cotton Industry Statistics Association's estimate of 9,596,684 dan last year. This news of a huge harvest made people uneasy, and sellers were active. The new cotton trend felt very sluggish, and short sellers gathered. However, whether there will be any changes in the weather in the future is still questionable. It was found that new cotton was sold to various Chinese and foreign factories, about 23,000 bales of white-packaged cotton, Tongzhou cotton, Taicang cotton, Yao cotton, and Fire Machine, which shows the factory's strong appetite and active procurement. The highest and lowest prices for the new cotton thrown on the market are listed below. (All are old scale prices)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fujian Merchants Have Already Started Procuring; Cotton Cloth Market Temporarily Becomes Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was weak, but because marked yarn and cotton fell and then rebounded, the cloth market temporarily became stable. The price of goods changed very little. The 10-pound city cloth of the dyed ocean yarn that was issued last month has fallen sharply due to seasonal factors. The current selling price is only 6.65 yuan, which is a huge drop of 7 jiao from the peak of 7.35 yuan. The Sichuan Gang, which had repeatedly shipped blue cloth and colored twill to be installed last month, has no movement in subsequent batches due to the sluggish sales and poor sales in the main sales areas of Chongqing and Chengdu. The flower velvet, broadcloth, straight tribute, and blue cloth, colored twill and other goods that were pre-ordered are still extremely busy shipping in recent days. The sales of fine twill in Guangdong and Yunnan are poor, and although the Shanghai market price has fallen, it is still difficult to match the accumulated inventory of low-end products. Those who hold the goods still want to turn a profit, resulting in increasingly sluggish sales. The procurement appetite of Fujian Gang has moved slightly. Yesterday, they imported more than 100 pieces of blue cloth, Yuan twill, straight tribute, broadcloth, fine cloth, fine twill, heavy-weight coarse twill, and light-weight coarse cloth. The Yangtze River and Hankou Gang have more than 200 pieces of flower velvet, broadcloth, straight tribute, and low-end fine twill and fine cloth from their own factories.</p>
<h3>Plain Serge is Rising Rapidly</h3>
<p>Raw Tibetan grey plain serge has been selling well in the market recently, and customer gangs have continued to purchase, and the situation has become very prosperous because of this. Western goods are lacking in both arrivals and inventory, and the remaining eastern goods are also hidden, and the prices have risen rapidly. Yesterday, 1,000 pieces of Yongyu were sold together at 2.625 yuan, 2,500 pieces of Ito serge were sold for 2.725 yuan, French 实多 serge was sold for 3.25 yuan on average, 旧货大发财 serge from Deji was sold for 3.6 yuan, and 918 of 章华 Guohuo was sold for 1.875 yuan per brick.</p>
<h3>Grains: Futures Flour Falls Sharply Across All Months; Market Situation Purely Shifts with Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market, after opening in the morning, the market for all months showed a sharp decline. The price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell 7 to 9 jiao, Canada fell about 1.12 yuan. When the opening price was announced, the market morale, in view of the strong decline of foreign wheat, and the current actual sales were still dull, and the enthusiasm of the outside industry was not as strong as before, so the opening price was 3 to 4 cents lower than the previous day. The transactions of all months were very prosperous due to the large number of settlements by both parties. Until after the second trading session, August and September were still average, and the forward price turned stable again due to covering short positions. The rise and fall of the current market situation purely shifts with the price of foreign wheat, and the high price has also entered a reaction that is easy to fall.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Plummets; Futures Opening Price Also Loosens - Continues to Fall by Eight to Nine Cents Across All Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, after opening in the morning, all months showed a plummeting trend. Due to the plummet in the price of foreign wheat, falling from seven to nine jiao to one yuan and three jiao, the market morale was greatly loosened. After the opening price was announced, all months immediately fell by four to five cents. Later, as the flour market also reported a sharp drop, the morale became more and more empty, and the asking price gradually loosened, falling from seven to eight to nine cents compared to the previous day. However, people in the industry felt that the production area was still not loose, and some still wanted to defend it. The spot wheat market is also not small, but customers' minds are still holding on, and manufacturers want to suppress the price, so high-quality goods are still opening at eight jiao, and special high-quality goods are even reaching eight and a half jiao. The middle class has lowered the price. Only 2,000 to 3,000 packages have been seen changing hands. It is rumored that Japanese merchants have a very greedy intention and have already eaten high-quality goods up to 4.9 jiao, which is also unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Dongxin Japonica Arrives in Large Quantities, and Prices Fall</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 178 ships arrived from various gangs, with a total of 3,450 stones of goods. In the thick japonica market, the price continued to depreciate by five fen because there were not many transactions in this street. Early rice arrived and sold similarly, and the market was neither good nor bad. Although the Bao Wei of Bo rice only handled about 200 from Weihaiwei, due to the shortage of high-quality materials, the market price increased by about one jiao. However, the middle market is still average, and Duyang pointed rice has no rise or fall, and the Yin becomes the Yuan Ding situation. A total of more than 30 stones arrived in Dongxin South Shanghai, but as the weather cleared up, the market was flourishing, but the price was low.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 112 ships of goods arrived from various roads in Hexia. The various colors of the market have gone through a little bit of white japonica and goat tip, and the remaining goods are weak. The market price of white japonica is a small number of points for high-quality goods, and ten or so points to nearly jiao for middle and second-quality goods. The goat tip fell by one or two jiao, and Bo rice fell by about one jiao. The 尖 of 元港 khách remains average and sluggish. The arrival of 东新粳 is booming day by day, and the departure is not smooth, and the price has fallen by two jiao, opening at 10.08 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Sells Well and the Market的气复振</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Customer Indica rice, at first, was neither good nor bad, and the market was neither good nor bad. Later, because of the message from the Northern gang and the smooth handling of 粵 in the 후, the 粤 appetite was still strong, and the whole city traded 1,500 packages of brown rice. The city surface, which was flat and soulless, was also 활기 thanks to this. The Northern gang also dealt with 500 packages of 기靖 and others, and the appetite for the 내지 was also 활, so although the 시장세는 resembled the 전市, the khí of the 시장 was very 俏, and the 시장세는 was also 암提 three or five points. The 统市 opened 1,469 packages of Jiangxi rice, 450 packages of Xiang rice, 180 packages of Sha City糙米, 329 packages of Jiangbei糙米, 140 packages of 甬rice, and 170 packages of 温州New Engine rice.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans Oversupply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's new soybean market, because the buyer saw that the origin was surging, intentionally tried to low price, so the high-quality market was small three or four points. At this moment, the general situation turned to an oversupply situation. Fortunately, the sales market was still 활络, so it temporarily had a little 지나고. Yesterday, it was estimated that more than 1,500 packages of 城门 rice, 1,3400 packages of 江桥 rice, 500 packages of 珠溪 rice, 500 packages of 都昌 rice, 300 packages of 鄱阳 rice, 100 packages of 瑞洪 rice, 53 packages of 三阳 rice, 500 packages of 柳芳池 rice, 81 packages of 汉日早黄, 1,000 packages of 三阳夹书, 5600 packages of 都阳夹靑, 87 packages of 汉口粉靑, and the departure was still for the 본街 및 내지 차坊 구매.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Min Gang Has Already Purchased; Cotton Cloth Market Temporarily Becomes Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, although weak, temporarily became stable due to the rebound of marked yarn and cotton after falling. The price of goods changed very little. The 10-pound city cloth of the dyed ocean yarn that was issued last month has fallen sharply due to seasonal factors. The current selling price is only 6.65 yuan, which is a huge drop of 7 jiao from the peak of 7.35 yuan. The Sichuan Gang, which had repeatedly shipped blue cloth and colored twill to be installed last month, has no movement in subsequent batches due to the sluggish sales and poor sales in the main sales areas of Chongqing and Chengdu. The flower velvet, broadcloth, straight tribute, and blue cloth, colored twill and other goods that were pre-ordered are still extremely busy shipping in recent days.

<p>Children's Special</p>
<h3>Aim to Do Great Things, Not to Be a High Official</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>Recently, at a friend's house, I heard his mother say to her child: "Now that you have graduated from elementary school and are going to middle school, study hard. In the future, if you become a high official, your parents will be able to live comfortably for the rest of their lives."</p>
<p>Children! Think calmly, is this instilling this outdated thinking into your parents? Because you are instilled with it in your mind every day, developing the habit of wanting to be a high official, you will naturally take being an official as a prerequisite in society, only caring about yourself.</p>
<p>What is meant by great things? It means: "No matter what you do, you must have a beginning and an end, and do it thoroughly and successfully. That is a great thing." In the past, after Watt invented the steam engine, the world's industry underwent a major change, from handicrafts to machine industry. When he invented the steam engine, he saw the steam surging in the kettle and pushing the lid open. He therefore consulted his mother, who gave a vague answer. He was dissatisfied and began to study it, and it took him twenty years to complete the steam engine. Pasteur devoted his energy to investigating things that ordinary people could not see. These tiny things were beyond the reach of ordinary people's eyesight, but Pasteur studied their structure, properties, and relationship to certain things from beginning to end, creating a systematic result, which is microorganisms. Therefore, the world knew that it was necessary to eliminate these microorganisms. Pasteur studied these small things, but he was able to do it thoroughly and achieved results, which became a great thing; therefore, Watt, Pasteur, and others are eternally immortal in history.</p>
<p>This proves that people should set their ambitions when they are young, and they will naturally succeed in the future. Therefore, I hope that all children will first determine their own ambitions and their own outlook on life, so that they can benefit the country and society when they grow up. For thousands of years, there have been many people in China with aspirations, but their ambition to be officials is an outdated idea, focusing on personal development and seeking personal happiness.</p>
<p>Dear children! Always remember: Aim to do great things, not to be a high official.</p>
<h3>A Patriotic Child Who Committed Suicide</h3>
<p>— Lu Guowei</p>
<p>Children, I am telling you a sad piece of news: In Pucheng, there was a fourteen-year-old child, surnamed Zhou, named Zixin. He usually studied very hard and often went to the library to read books and newspapers. The teachers and students of the school respected him very much. Recently, this respectable child of ours saw that the national situation was becoming more and more critical, and that there was still civil war in his own country. In grief and indignation, he secretly found a bottle of nitric acid and swallowed it to commit suicide. Later, when his family found out and wanted to treat him, it was too late. This respectable and lovable child had left this world and bid us farewell forever.</p>
<p>Children! After seeing this tragic and solemn suicide, what should we feel besides sympathizing with this child? I think this patriotic suicide is indeed a manifestation of patriotic enthusiasm and can awaken some people who are oblivious to national affairs and live in a drunken stupor. However, if all the children in the country follow his example and commit suicide because of patriotism, then who will be responsible for saving the country in the future? Therefore, this is not a positive and rational solution, but a negative and irrational one. The truly positive and rational way to save the country is for children to work hard in their studies from today onwards, cultivate a healthy body and mind, and develop a spirit of mutual assistance and love. Prepare for the time when the country needs us, we can use our rich knowledge and healthy body to serve the country, save the country, and restore the glory of our motherland. At that time, this patriotic child will also smile at us from beyond the grave.</p>
<h3>Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The fire-like sun shines its intense light directly onto the ground, so the mercury column on the thermometer has risen to about a hundred degrees. The trees are drooping their heads, looking very frustrated, allowing it to trample them without resistance. People are also fanning themselves and sweating, constantly shouting "hot" - flies and mosquitoes have a good opportunity to be active, searching for their food in groups, working separately. Daytime is the working time for flies, and nighttime is the working time for mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Of course, Min'er's home is also inevitably attacked by mosquitoes at night, and they are in groups, their traces can be found everywhere. Because his home is located in a remote area, and the ponds and green grass are all major bases for mosquito production, the harm from mosquitoes in the summer is not small. Min'er is the most afraid of mosquitoes in his family, so he often takes a cattail fan as a weapon to drive away mosquitoes when enjoying the cool breeze at night. He feels that these mosquitoes are really hateful and always wants to find a way to eliminate them, so he discusses this issue with his older brother, Cong'er: "Brother, how can we eliminate mosquitoes?"</p>
<p>"This is a big question. There are ways to eliminate them, like mosquito coils, but this is not a fundamental method. I think the fundamental method is to kill its eggs and larvae, then mosquitoes will certainly not be found again. Although this is a fundamental method, it must be implemented by everyone in the country, because they can fly, otherwise what is the use?"</p>
<p>"Speaking of mosquitoes, I have a question, that is, I often hear people say that they have malaria. How does this malaria occur? Is it transmitted by mosquitoes?"</p>
<p>"Malaria is originally caused by sporozoa in microorganisms that parasitize the red blood cells in the human body. When anopheles mosquitoes (a type of mosquito that specializes in transmitting malaria) suck the blood of people with malaria, the malaria parasites are sucked into their stomachs along with the blood and undergo very complex developmental changes in their bodies. When these anopheles mosquitoes suck other people's blood again, the malaria parasites are transmitted to those people's bodies along with the saliva of the anopheles mosquitoes, and those people develop malaria. Therefore, we must always pay attention to these anopheles mosquitoes sucking our blood, but how can we distinguish between anopheles mosquitoes and ordinary mosquitoes? Ordinary mosquitoes and anopheles mosquitoes are easy to distinguish: (1) The wings of ordinary mosquitoes are transparent, while the wings of anopheles mosquitoes have brown spots. (2) The head and thorax of ordinary mosquitoes are gray, and the abdomen is slightly green. The entire body of anopheles mosquitoes is yellowish-brown. (3) Ordinary mosquitoes fly with a high-pitched sound, while anopheles mosquitoes fly with a lower sound. (4) Ordinary mosquitoes have a smaller body, while anopheles mosquitoes have a larger body than ordinary mosquitoes. (5) When ordinary mosquitoes are stationary on the wall, their bodies are parallel to the wall surface, and their hind legs are upward. When anopheles mosquitoes are stationary, their bodies are not parallel to the wall surface, and their hind legs droop slightly. (6) The legs of ordinary mosquitoes are slightly longer than their bodies, while the legs of anopheles mosquitoes are twice as long as their bodies. (7) The eggs of ordinary mosquitoes are oval and are often laid in dirty water, with as many as two or three hundred eggs, clustered together. The eggs of anopheles mosquitoes are thin and are often laid in clear water, with only twenty or so eggs, and are not clustered together. (8) The larvae of ordinary mosquitoes (wrigglers) are brown and have longer respiratory tubes, so they droop downward from the water surface when breathing. The wrigglers of anopheles mosquitoes are green and have shorter respiratory tubes, so their bodies are parallel to the water surface when breathing."</p>
<h3>The Deer and the Woodcutter</h3>
<p>— Lan Shan</p>
<p>One day, a deer was strolling leisurely in the forest when it suddenly heard the sound of someone riding a horse. They were hunters, and that deer was their target.</p>
<p>The deer ran away desperately, but no matter what, it could still hear the hunters chasing after it. It had already walked a very, very long way, and it felt that all four legs were tired. At this time, it happened to meet a woodcutter.</p>
<p>It rushed to the woodcutter, asking with a begging expression:</p>
<p>"Uncle Woodcutter, where can I hide! Alas! Where can I hide my body?"</p>
<p>"Go into my hut!" The woodcutter pointed to his own house and replied, "I will definitely not tell them that you are hiding there!"</p>
<p>So it hid in the hut. And the hunters had already chased after it. They saw the woodcutter and asked him if he had just seen a deer pass by. He did not answer them, but only pointed to the hut with his hand.</p>
<p>But although the deer was hiding in the house, it was constantly watching the woodcutter's actions. Now that it knew the woodcutter had leaked the news, it hurriedly jumped out of the window and left before the hunters came to attack it.</p>
<p>When the hunters saw that the deer had left, they said, "Let it go today! We don't want that deer." With that, they went back.</p>
<p>A few days later, the woodcutter met the deer and asked it with dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>"Why did you leave without thanking me that day?"</p>
<p>It replied, "Because you are not honest - you broke your promise!"</p>
<p>"But I didn't tell those hunters that you were hiding there!"</p>
<p>"Okay," the deer said, "Although you didn't tell them with your tongue and mouth, you used your hand to tell them. The harm of your dishonesty is still the same. - I don't need a friend like you either." After saying that, it left without looking back.</p>

<h3>My Summer Vacation Life</h3>
<p>— Feng Huizhen</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, like flowing water, and in a short time, summer vacation has arrived again.</p>
<p>But this vacation is very long. During this month or so, of course, we can't just chat, talk, and play all day long. I think we must do some work. Now I will write down my summer vacation life:</p>
<p>(1) Do holiday homework every day.</p>
<p>(2) Tutor subjects that I failed.</p>
<p>(3) Physical exercise.</p>
<p>(4) Read books that are beneficial outside of school.</p>
<p>(5) Keep a diary every day.</p>
<p>(6) Take a bath every day.</p>
<p>(7) Sometimes tell stories and jokes with my siblings.</p>
<p>(8) Help my parents with housework every day.</p>
<h3>Making an Active Film Projector</h3>
<p>— Cao Jianpei</p>
<p>Children! This is a very easy scientific trick to do. If you are all willing to try it, I am very willing to join your team and work together.</p>
<p>Find a pair of scissors, a needle and thread, and a piece of cardboard (if there is other beautiful paperboard, that would be even better). Cut the cardboard into two and a half inches high and three and a half inches long. On the cardboard, use colored pencils to draw a goldfish bowl on one side (as shown in Figure 1) and a goldfish on the other side (as shown in Figure 2). Or draw them on white paper and paste them onto the cardboard with paste. After these procedures are completed, use a needle to drill a hole at each end of the cardboard, and tie a string to each hole (as shown in Figure 3). Okay, our film projector is made, and we have an active film to watch.</p>
<p>How to start it? And how to watch it?</p>
<p>Children! Let me tell you. Our active film is not as grand as the ones in movie theaters. There are no ticket sellers, ticket takers, film projectors, or audiences. We are the ones who make and show the films, and we are also the audience. But we don't charge fees, so we don't need ticket sellers or ticket takers. Hold the strings at both ends of the cardboard tightly with your hands, and rotate the two strings alternately with your thumb and index finger, rotating them a little faster. Then look at the cardboard, how is it? Haha! The goldfish are being raised in the goldfish bowl.</p>
<p>Find another piece of cardboard. Draw a bird on one side and a cage on the other side, let's play it again, isn't it interesting, the bird is in the cage.</p>
<p>We can change many patterns according to the above method, such as drawing an athlete kicking a ball, a young teacher teaching, or a strongman shooting an arrow. As long as you can think of it, you can try to draw it on the cardboard as much as possible.</p>
<p>Children, what is the principle behind this? In fact, this is an active film. Originally, the goldfish are on one side of the cardboard, and the goldfish bowl is on the other side of the cardboard. Because the speed of the cardboard rotation blurs our eyeballs, and at the same time, because the speed of the cardboard rotation transforms the shadows of the two sides into one, so when we look at it, the goldfish are being raised in the bowl.</p>
<p>If we make four or five pieces of cardboard, or dozens of pieces of cardboard, in the same way, and draw them in a series of comic strips, it will be like watching a movie scene by scene.</p>
<p>Children! Real active films are also made up of many pictures in succession, reflected by electric light.</p>

<h3>Cold Boiled Water</h3>
<p>— Fang Zheng</p>
<p>On Sunday, Ming'er came back from the sports field, covered in sweat, and wanted to get some cold water to quench his thirst. His older brother, Zhi'er, saw him and quickly stopped him, saying: "You can't drink cold water. I have some cold boiled water here, take some and drink it!" Ming'er drank the ice-like cold boiled water, but felt very strange. He thought to himself: They are both cold, why can't I drink cold water, but I can drink ice-like cold boiled water? What is the reason for this? So he asked his brother.</p>
<p>"What's the reason? It's a long story, but I can only tell you the main point now. Cold water is raw water, because it has not been cooked by heat, there are many active bacteria (microorganisms) in it. Although we can't see them with our naked eyes, we can see their original form under a microscope. According to the great French scientist Pasteur, every pound of cold water contains as many as 20% bacteria. If we eat bacteria into our stomachs, it will cause changes, such as cholera, abdominal pain, dysentery, etc. Therefore, cold water cannot be drunk lightly. Cold boiled water has been through a heating process, it has become hot water itself, and the bacteria have been killed. This cold is only temporary, but its degree is no different from that of boiling water, so drinking it in summer is not only harmless, but also beneficial!"</p>
<p>Ming'er listened to his brother's words and realized his past mistakes, so from this day on, he corrected them.</p>
<h3>The Use of Nose Hair</h3>
<p>— Microbe</p>
<p>Children, the "nose hair" in the nose tube grows inside, and it seems to have no use at all. Some people who are idle stick their fingers into the nose tube and pluck a few hairs, thinking that it doesn't matter much anyway, and relieve their loneliness. In fact, everything that is born on the human body must have some use. For example, when a strong wind blows and dust sweeps in, can't the "nose hair" block it and prevent the dust from entering? Usually: When we wash our face every morning, we only need to roll the towel a few times in our nose, and you will be "blackened" on the towel that you won't believe. So if there were no "nose hair", it would definitely be even worse!</p>
<p>Children, "nose hair" is like the "wire" screen window installed on a new-style house, don't pull it out!</p>

<h3>Bamboo Tube Rice</h3>
<p>——Reply to Wang Jiasheng, Chinese School, Yokohama, Japan</p>
<p>Brother Jiasheng: You must be a "veteran" of outdoor living, otherwise you wouldn't have written such an interesting letter. I wonder if our guess is correct?</p>
<p>That's right, when we go outdoors, the lighter the supplies, the better. But we have to bring at least some of our cooking utensils, otherwise there will be panic, unless we eat dry food. However, some travelers can solve their eating problems very satisfactorily even if they have nothing with them.</p>
<p>You say you know how to use hot stones to fry eggs, mud to bake chicken, fire ash to roast sweet potatoes, and branches to bake bread, but you don't know if there is any simple way to cook rice. You can't be blamed for this, even though you are already a senior Boy Scout; because few people pay attention to this problem.</p>
<p>But here we have a very wonderful way to tell you, which is to cook rice in a bamboo tube.</p>
<p>You can first find a large bamboo tube. One end must have a bamboo node as the bottom. Then pour in the washed rice, add the appropriate amount of water, and then use washed grass to plug the mouth of the bamboo tube tightly. This completes your work. Then throw it into the fire, after a while, you can hear a louder cracking sound, which is when the bamboo tube splits, then you take it out, and at this time, a tube of hot rice is already in front of you.</p>
<p>It's strange to say, bamboo tubes can also cook rice! This was told to us by a Boy Scout who traveled all over the country, saying that it was a valuable gain from his experience! Japan is also a bamboo-producing area, I hope you can try it out!</p>
<p>Our Boy Scouts originally used everything in nature as our slaves at any time, I hope you will pay more attention to this point and often give us valuable reports! That's all, I wish you success!</p>
<p>Sincerely, China Boy Scout Self-Help Society</p>
<h3>The King and the Shepherd Boy (3)</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>The shepherd boy replied, "It is for my father to watch over the flock of sheep. He had it long before I was born."</p>
<p>The little king asked, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Yesterday I was exactly seventeen years old"? The shepherd boy replied.</p>
<p>The little king cheered and said, "You are also seven years old? This is so much fun! Yesterday I was also exactly seven years old," but who lives with you? They certainly don't want you to run out here alone, do they?</p>
<p>The shepherd boy replied, "But I had to run out alone, and I really want to go home."</p>
<p>The little king wondered, "You like to go home? This is so much fun! When I am at home, I want to run out; sitting on this silver-like frost! You have been playing with these strangely beautiful sheep for so long? Their bells, how beautiful they are! Where did you get that shepherd's crook? I would really like to get one like that too. Just like yours."</p>
<p>At that time, a tall man bowed low and interjected, "Your Majesty, we must go back. Just now it seemed that the tutor said that Your Majesty's studies are important, and today you can only rest for an hour."</p>
<p>The king stamped his feet and scolded! "Tch! How annoying! I can't stand those tiresome lessons! I must stay outside in the sunshine." Then he asked the shepherd boy, "Child, let me ask you, when do you go back to do your homework?"</p>
<p>The shepherd boy shook his head and said, "I don't do any homework."</p>
<p>The king shouted happily, "What do you mean, you don't do any homework? Hey! You are a lucky child. Then how long will you stay outside?"</p>
<p>The shepherd boy replied, "I won't go back until it gets dark."</p>
<p>The king啧啧 said again, "I won't go back until it gets dark? Hey-hey-hey-hey! How lovely! I never come out in the evening, I really like to watch the stars appear in the sky. Have you ever seen a glittering star pierce through the darkness and come out? Hey! But where are your clothes?"</p>
<p>The shepherd boy hurriedly said, "I don't have any clothes."</p>
<p>The king said in surprise, "So you just wear that dead sheep on your body, that's all? It must be very comfortable. My clothes are hot and heavy."</p>

<h3>How to Satisfy Your Appetite?</h3>
<p>— Cao Youmin</p>
<p>Speaking of appetite, everyone can recall the old saying, "Eating, drinking, and sex are the greatest desires of man!" Therefore, if you spend a little effort and time on the study of food in order to satisfy your appetite, it is probably something that fellow enthusiasts would be happy to hear about, right? But I want to remind everyone that this article is not about introducing you to places to buy food and drinks, but rather telling you how to enjoy food prepared by your own hands in a situation where you need to do it yourself. Sometimes, for example, when you are traveling alone and not used to the local cuisine, the same fish, meat, and vegetables can be impossible to swallow. You can't prepare it yourself, and you don't even know how to tell the cook to change it. Thinking about it, this kind of suffering is unavoidable for both men and women.</p>
<p>Generally, people who have lived in a foreign land for a while, if they have some leisure time, then researching cooking methods can be considered "a pleasure," right?</p>
<p>If we talk about cooking methods from a horizontal perspective—that is, in terms of type—the principles are nothing more than "steaming," "baking," time-consuming, roasting, mixing," seven characters. However, because "steaming," "baking," are time-consuming, and controlling the heat is not easy, ordinary cooking invariably falls within the scope of braising, boiling, frying, stir-frying, and mixing. Among these five, "mixing" is the easiest. Mixing is divided into cold mixing and hot mixing. Almost everyone knows how to mix cold dishes, such as "mixed jellyfish," "mixed cucumber," and "mixed tofu." Hot mixing is not common in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but it is common in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Sichuan. Hot mixing seems like stir-frying, but to prevent the dishes from becoming too mushy, they are often pan-fried, and ingredients such as sauce, vinegar, and chili are mixed together. When boiling hot, they are poured from the pan into a bowl containing vegetables and stirred immediately with chopsticks to cook them. Examples include pickled cucumbers, oil-drenched cabbage, and oil-soaked tripe in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan cuisine, and also in Beijing cuisine. Pan-frying and oil-poaching are similar, but they are related to both "stir-frying" and "braising." For example, when cooking fish, except for steaming, you must first start by frying. By custom, in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces, mostly one side is fried until golden brown, and then it is braised with a sauce of five flavors (the method of braising West Lake Fish is simply not fried; the fresh fish is scaled, gutted, and washed, and then blanched in boiling water, and then a sauce is added. Therefore, it is very tender and fresh when eaten.) Further west, in provinces such as Hunan and Hubei, both sides must be fried until golden brown, while in Sichuan and Yunnan, people eat crispy-skinned fish that has been fried very thoroughly. As for salted fish, it is considered most delicious when pan-fried everywhere. When frying vegetables, the oil (mostly lard, but butter, goose fat, sesame oil, and vegetable oil can also be used) must be heated until extremely hot (if you sprinkle a little salt into the pan and hear a loud sound, it is extremely hot). At that time, put the fish and meat into the pan. In fact, the initial steps of "stir-frying" and "braising" are also the same. For "frying," more refined cooks use a frying pan. (Flat-bottomed pans are very popular nowadays because of the trend towards Europeanization. Small families often fry breaded fish, fried steak, ham and eggs, etc.) Roasting and grilling are not very different; it's just that meat is roasted directly in the fire with iron forks or tongs, iron chopsticks, etc., such as roast duck, roasted meat, crispy roasted pork, and roasted pork. Besides "roasting," there is another similar type of "smoking," such as smoked fish and smoked chicken. They must also go through the frying process beforehand, but the seasoning sauce must be applied to the entire surface of the fish or chicken in advance. There is very little frying time (use little oil to prevent sticking). After removing, put fennel, star anise, and other spices and pre-soaked dried tea leaves in the pan, and then put the fish and chicken on a special iron rack (crossed bamboo chopsticks will also work), supported on the spices, and burn the pot with a slow fire, so that the smoke from the spices rises up to smoke them.</p>
<p>Shanghai people always say "braise" side dishes in their everyday language, so "braising" is very popular in Shanghai; it's similar to how Suzhou people say "put it in the pot and steam it" all the time. This "braising" is called water-stir-frying in southwestern China, indicating that less oil is used and more water is used for help. Dishes such as stir-fried shredded pork with bean curd sheets, assorted seafood, oyster sauce tofu, and braised sliced radish with pork are different from stir-frying. In fact, dry-stir-frying and scorched-stir-frying, which are popular in Sichuan and Yunnan, are almost like frying. "Stir-frying" is as easy as "braising" in cooking. The so-called "water-stir-frying" "braising" cannot actually use less oil; however, a considerable amount of water can be added when mixing the five-flavor sauce. But everyone can perform magic tricks, and each has different skills. Just take the commonly eaten stir-fried shredded pork as an example; if you think about it carefully, everyone will find it interesting and marvel at the variety of stir-fried shredded pork. I can also take this opportunity to introduce a humorous story about stir-fried shredded pork to make everyone laugh.</p>
<p>This story has been passed down from the late Qing Dynasty, telling the story of a poor scholar in southern Fujian who, after the failure of Geng Jingzhong, one of the three feudatories, married a cook released from the Geng mansion as his wife. Hearing about the delicacies and strangely cooked dishes that Geng Jingzhong ate every day made the scholar's mouth water. He asked his wife to make two good dishes to satisfy his appetite. His wife said: I only managed one dish in the Geng mansion, which is "stir-fried shredded pork." I don't know how to do anything else. But this stir-fried shredded pork must be made with a strip of pork tenderloin taken from a whole pig. The scholar obeyed respectfully. He finally waited until the day of Confucius's birthday when sacrificial meat was distributed. He begged his colleagues at the school palace to get a strip of tenderloin and took it home to his wife. She cut it, mixed it with a five-flavor sauce, and stir-fried a bowl of shredded pork. Sure enough, it smelled wonderful. At this time, the scholar wanted to drink wine, so his wife went out to buy him wine. Who would have thought that when she returned, the scholar was lying in the kitchen, and the bowl of shredded pork had been eaten clean? She helped him up and asked what he was doing. The scholar mumbled incoherently. With great difficulty, she finally understood what he meant. It turned out that the scholar was so impatient because of the aroma of the stir-fried shredded pork that he began to chew it greedily on his own. When he finished eating everything in the bowl and chewing everything in his mouth, he unknowingly chewed and ate a section of his own tongue, so he fell to the ground in pain!</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the vertical aspect of cooking methods—that is, the process from raw vegetables to cooked dishes. The first step is chopping board work. This work is dangerous. If you don't do it right, the big kitchen knife in your right hand can cut off your finger just like the tongue-chewing scholar. Therefore, when you buy fish, meat, and vegetables yourself or ask someone to buy them for you, you can tell the vegetable seller to cut them for you in advance. Whether it's shredded pork or fish cubes, it's all possible. The key is to mix the five-flavor sauce. When mixing, you can taste it yourself first and put a small bowl next to the pot to avoid the trouble of not knowing how to season it later. The next step is to rub the sliced ​​meat or shredded pork with a little cornstarch. When frying fish, you can mix it in the five-flavor sauce. After preparing outside the pot, start working inside the pot. Put oil, heat the oil, and sprinkle salt into the oil pan. When the oil is boiling, put the vegetables, meat, and fish into the oil pan. If the oil is very hot, the fish, meat, and vegetables that go in will definitely be cooked after flipping a few times (you don't have to worry about them not being cooked, so you burn them until they are old and tasteless). Then use a spoon to scoop them out and put them in a bowl; then separately fry the five-flavor sauce in the pot. Then, you can put the fish, meat, and vegetables back into the pot with the five-flavor sauce for a quick braise or stir-fry, or simply pour the five-flavor sauce over the bowl of fish, meat, and vegetables for a hot mix. In short, you can always distinguish which ones are easy to cook and which ones are not, and adjust their heat accordingly.</p>
<p>Nature gave people a nose and a tongue, both of which are extremely clever. By smelling and tasting, you can adapt to the situation and take advantage of it. Therefore, I think satisfying your appetite is not difficult. If you practice diligently, you will create some variations. The "color, aroma, taste, and presentation" are indispensable!</p>
<p>The color of the fire, the color of the vegetables, the color of the five-flavor sauce (many people don't use dark soy sauce and often use salt water to keep the color of the vegetables from turning black), and the color of the bowl. People who are skilled in cooking do pay attention to the "color" of the dishes. When they are brought to the table, if the color of the dishes is good and the aroma is complete, then the mouth and tongue will naturally match the appetite, and you will be satisfied. Moreover, cooking methods and knife skills are also closely related. Otherwise, if you use ingredients such as meat shredded like door planks, diced chicken like stone eggs, and vegetables chopped with random cuts, no matter how flavorful you make them, they will always be disgusting!</p>
<p>Knife skills are not difficult either. The sharper the kitchen knife, the better. The knife should be large, sharp, thin, and thick-backed. Whether you are cutting shredded pork, diced meat, sliced meat, or minced meat, you must first slice off the skin of a piece of raw meat; then slice and separate the fat and lean meat. (If you are braising red-braised pork, you should use streaky pork, and cut the fat, lean meat, and skin together. This is an exception.) Hold the knife in your right hand and hold the top of the square piece of meat with your left hand. Cut horizontally, slicing large pieces from right to left (you don't need to separate them). Then use the knife to cut from top to bottom. (At this time, you can separate three or five slices and stack them for cutting, which is easier for larger pieces.) First make strips of large shredded meat, then cut them open. Separate the fat and lean meat and place them in bowls separately. (When stir-frying shredded pork, put the fatty meat in the pot first, and the lean meat later, because the fatty meat has fat that can be rendered and is easier to eat when browned.) If you are cutting ingredients such as fish kidneys, belly, gizzards, and livers, the large slice work is the same. When you get to the small slices, you need to make patterns on the small slices (use a knife to carve net-shaped patterns or square patterns on the small slices). They will naturally curl into flower shapes when you put them in the pot.</p>
<p>Now, let's add a method for making a "Sichuan soup." Sichuan soup does not refer to Sichuan alone; however, this method is most common in Sichuan. Usually, everyone knows about sliced meat soup, but they often suffer from the soup being salty and cloudy, and the sliced meat is always tough. The characteristic of Sichuan soup is that it focuses on being light and fresh, clear and flavorful, and the sliced meat is tender and delicious. The addition of sliced fragrant mushrooms, sliced pickled mustard tuber, sliced loofah, and pea shoots makes the colors bright, green, and pleasing. For cooking, usually no colored soy sauce is used, only salt water and cornstarch are rubbed on the sliced ​​meat and placed in a small bowl separately; then cut fragrant mushrooms, pickled mustard tuber (must be washed and sliced), sliced loofah, or pea shoots and place them aside separately. When the water in the pot is about to boil, first put the pickled mustard tuber, fragrant mushrooms, and sliced loofah into it. After it boils, add the sliced ​​meat. The sliced ​​meat must be placed in a slotted spoon to allow it to float in the soup for about one or two minutes. As soon as it is cooked, scoop it out and put it in a large bowl, and then scoop the soup into the bowl (if it is the season for pea shoots, the pea shoots should also be handled like the sliced ​​meat, and cannot be put in the pot). While it is hot, sprinkle a little salt and a little pepper. When brought to the table, it is not only beautiful in color, but also very delicious in taste. Naturally, the people at the table will "love the Sichuan soup at first sight and eat it all up."</p>

<h3>Current Status of Gold Production in Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Shi</p>
<p>Gold is the main currency of the capitalist world; although most countries in the world have abandoned the gold standard, the importance and role of gold in the capitalist world has not diminished as a result. We can see the domestic situation of a country from the amount of gold it holds and the flow of its surplus. Similarly, we can see the general international situation from information on the world's gold supply. What I am going to report on now is the recent situation of the world's gold supply.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about gold production. There was a sharp decrease after the last World War. The lowest production was in</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>1922, when the total world gold production was 15.4 million ounces. After that, production showed an increasing trend, and by 1930, world gold production had increased to 16 million to 20 million ounces. However, this increase in production was uneven and inconsistent. For example, the production of the Rand gold mine in South Africa increased significantly at this time, and the production of the Soviet Union and Canada also increased slightly, but the production of the United States and Australia decreased.</p>
<p>After 1930, due to the development of the unprecedented Great Depression, the fall in prices, the devaluation of currency in the United Kingdom and the United States, and the high price of gold, gold production was greatly stimulated. Under this stimulus, the profits of gold production increased greatly, which continued to attract new investment in gold mines, promoted the expansion of old mines, and the development of new mines. First of all, the gold mines that had been abandoned in the western United States in the past were reopened at this time, and the development of new gold mines had developed to the southeast. The key is Canada, which at this time had reached areas far into the Arctic Circle for gold mining; in those places, gold mine owners used the latest gold mining methods and airplanes to extract and transport gold. At the same time, old mines in Australia, New Zealand, and Chile were also reopened. The old gold mine workers have continued to work, and the gold production has naturally returned to its former glory.</p>
<p>Among the increase in world gold production, it is worth paying special attention to the Soviet Union and South Africa. The former ranks first in the world in gold production, while the latter ranks second.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the Soviet Union. In recent years, the number of people working in the gold mining industry in the Soviet Union has increased to 700,000. They use the latest type of dredges to replace the traditional manual washing method, which has greatly increased gold production in Siberia. Their gold mines are all mechanized. With the use of the latest machinery, the production of the Ural gold mines has recently increased greatly. Most of this gold is transported out by the Soviet government to purchase machinery and other needed items in order to strive for domestic construction.</p>
<p>As for the Union of South Africa, it is of course under British control. Therefore, its gold production is not only related to itself, but also related to the United Kingdom. First of all, with the United Kingdom's suspension of the gold standard, the South African gold pound also fell in price in December 1932, so the price of gold almost doubled. This result will of course promote the increase in gold production in South Africa. According to the current situation, it is estimated that the gold production in South Africa can increase to 15 million ounces.</p>
<p>Due to the rise in gold prices and the increase in gold production, South Africa's finances have naturally shown a good situation. In recent years, its treasury has had huge surpluses. The country's imports have also seen a significant increase. In 1932, they were 32 million pounds, but last year they increased to 75 million pounds; they more than doubled in three years. What do these facts indicate? In a word, it indicates the intensification of British imperialism's exploitation of the South African people and the active plunder of South African gold.</p>
<p>Now, we can also cite the following figures to more concretely show the recent production overview of the world's major gold producing areas—</p>
<p>Recent World Gold Production (unit: million old US dollars)</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that world gold production has generally increased in recent years; among them, the increase in the Soviet Union and Canada is particularly obvious. As for the gold production for this year, there are of course no overall statistics yet, but judging from the situation in the past few months, it is still continuing to increase. According to a survey, world gold production in January-February of this year was 5.2 million ounces, an increase of about 800,000 ounces compared to the same period last year. Among them, the production of the Union of South Africa, Canada, and the United States was 100,000 ounces more than the same period last year. At the same time, the Soviet Union, which ranks second in the world, has recently announced a gold production increase plan. According to this plan, the Soviet Union will produce more than 10 million ounces of gold this year; this is more than doubled compared to last year. In this way, what can be imagined now is that the increase in world gold production this year will necessarily show a new record; according to general estimates, gold production this year can reach 33 million to 35 million ounces or more. However, what is worth noting here is that if this estimate becomes a reality, and at the same time the Soviet Union's plan is also realized, then it means that the Soviet Union's gold production will account for one-third of the world; and the speed of the increase in the Soviet Union's gold production will also be higher compared to the capitalist world.</p>
<p>The above is only the situation of increased gold production, which is only one aspect of the increased world gold supply. At the same time, on the other hand, due to the increase in gold production, the originally hidden gold continues to be released, so the world gold supply is even greater. What is worth paying special attention to in this process is that before the Great Depression, India and other Oriental countries were traditional gold hoarding countries, and they absorbed about two-thirds of the world's gold production every year at that time. However, after the panic, India and other countries became sellers of gold. For example, India has exported 180 million pounds (900 million US dollars) of gold in the past four years alone; if we add the gold flowing out of China and British Malaya, then the total amount of hidden gold released from the Far East will be over 1 billion pounds.</p>
<p>However, where did such a large amount of gold production and re-released hidden gold flow to? The first is in the gold scramble between imperialist countries, and countries such as the United States and France have obtained large amounts of gold reserves. The second is that due to the development of the world crisis, the rich in European countries are striving to buy gold at home and abroad for storage, which has also absorbed a large amount of cash. For example, last year, of the total world gold supply of 1.2 billion US dollars, about 700 million US dollars were added to the currency gold and craft expenses of central banks in various countries, and the other 500 million US dollars of gold were absorbed by individuals; these individuals are mainly the wealthy in Europe and the United States. According to a survey, the situation of private gold hoarding has been developing this year, and so far, the amount of gold being hoarded is probably more than 1 billion US dollars.</p>
<p>The increase in gold supply could have promoted the rise in prices, but in fact prices did not rise as expected. This is because the gold standard has not been restored in various countries. They are using exchange rate wars to lower prices in order to dump goods; and the existing gold has not been taken out for circulation. It has already been declared separate from the standard currency. As for the increase in gold supply, various countries are still not stopping the gold scramble, and individuals are still hoarding gold, which is of course a manifestation of the war crisis.</p>
<h3>Wages of Workers in the Puppet State</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bo</p>
<p>Workers in "Manchukuo" can be roughly divided into three types: Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, among which Chinese account for more than 95% of the total. According to statistics from the South Manchuria Railway Company, the wages earned by Chinese workers employed in the company's repair factories are only equal to a quarter of the wages earned by Japanese workers in the same factory. In addition, the situation is similar in all other factories in "Manchukuo."</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the social recession, wages in "Manchukuo," whether for Chinese workers or Japanese workers, have generally decreased, but the wages of Chinese workers have been reduced more. For example, from April 1928 to February 1933, the wages of Chinese workers in the Fushun coal mine were reduced by 11.3%, while the wages of Japanese workers were only reduced by 7.8%.</p>
<p>As for Chinese agricultural workers in "Manchukuo," their wages have been greatly reduced - in some cases, they have been reduced by half.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also those who do not receive any wages at all, or even do not receive wages at all. Needless to say, their lives are more difficult than those of other workers.</p>

For people with sensitive skin, it is very suitable to pat cold cream on the face and neck before using this liquid, and don't just apply it and think it's done. You must dip your fingers in it and gently pat it on your face and neck. One more thing to pay attention to is that you must not only pat the throat, but also pat the back of the neck at the same time, because the back of the neck is more important and obvious than the throat.

<h3>Sorcerer</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xianting</p>
<p>We rely entirely on ghosts and spirits of the dead to live. Although whether ghosts and spirits truly exist in this world, I still cannot answer with certainty. But at the very least, people must believe in ghosts and spirits. Perhaps in foreign countries, in large cities, in places of civilization, there are very few people who live as we do? But in our backward, lowly rural society, our profession of seeking divine guidance, subduing demons, and delivering the deceased has an immense role. In a feudal society where ghosts and spirits control half of human affairs, people like us are precisely needed.</p>
<p>In other places, our names may be different, but here we are called "Duangong" or "Daoshi," meaning sorcerers. Besides occasionally serving as musicians for joyous celebrations such as weddings and birthdays, our main duties as Duangong Daoshi are to capture ghosts, deliver souls, and seek divine aid. Of course, some Duangong also practice old operas, performing at "temple fairs," "god gatherings," and "festivals" in their hometowns, or during people's "red and white affairs" (weddings and funerals). Some Daoshi also study "Yinyang," looking at the geography for the dead, but these are not the main tasks of our profession.</p>
<p>To earn a living in our profession is certainly not easy. I remember when I was ten years old and barely literate, I began preparing. Before officially becoming an apprentice, I had to read the preliminary scriptures at home, such as the "Earth Treasury Sutra," the "Sutra of Resolving Grievances," and the "Blood Basin Sutra," all read around the age of ten. I was already twelve years old when I became an apprentice. Being a Duangong is similar to being a doctor, a refined profession that requires some literacy. Not only must you be able to recite many fragmented scriptures, but you must also understand the formal documents that reach the Jade Emperor, know the proclamations to eliminate demons and monsters, and be able to write the yellow notices. You must even write elegies for the bereaved family, couplets of joy, longevity, and mourning for the host, and write invitations and funeral announcements for people. In my opinion, our talent and learning are generally more complex than what doctors possess. Naturally, in the eyes of the villagers, and in terms of rewards, we are better than doctors, that goes without saying. At my teacher's house, I read scriptures for another two years. During these two years, besides following the teacher to people's homes to "perform Dao rituals," "do small send-offs," and "celebrate altars," I also learned to write memorials and yellow notices at home. Usually, two-thirds of the time was spent going out with the teacher to make a living, so the time spent studying at home was very little. Therefore, many spells, divination methods, and various chants and Taoist practices were learned through practice. Moreover, this was not directly taught by the teacher, but learned by imitating the teacher's performances. In the third year, after thanking the teacher and performing a celebration, I was considered to have completed my apprenticeship.</p>
<p>When people get sick, we get business. Villagers believe that illnesses are caused by ghosts and spirits, either from past grievances or offending the heavens. They need us to do the work of sending away ghosts, eliminating disasters, and resolving grievances. This is called "Da Xiaosong" (small send-off), also known as "Da Luo" (beating the gong), which means sending away ghosts. "Da Luo" involves inviting a dozen or so Duangong, beating large gongs and drums, making a big commotion in the patient's home. Using peach wood talismans and command arrows (fake bows and arrows made of peach branches), they shoot randomly at the patient's door and bed, and various talismans are pasted on the doors, so that ghosts and monsters dare not enter again. People are dressed as ghosts and demons, and then disguised as divine soldiers to shoot, kill, and subdue them. Before doing these things, the patient's birth date and time must be written on a document and burned to report to the heavenly court. Then, the patient's illness and offending stars are investigated through divination, and the method of sending them away is determined. The "Da Luo" event starts at two in the afternoon and continues until the next morning. A boat made of rice straw is also made for the patient and burned with paper candles, called "sending the boat," meaning to send the ghosts away. A bowl of cold rice and some water are also scattered in the air near the house along with the paper candles, which is called "rewarding water rice," to let the ghosts eat. In short, both forceful and gentle methods are used to deal with ghosts. One is to capture and drive them away, and the other is to buy them off and respectfully send them away. This depends on what kind of ghost is offended. Wealthy families mostly beat gongs to catch ghosts, while poor families mostly "Da Xiaosong" to send ghosts away. Perhaps it is because wealthy people have power, and ghosts are afraid of them; while poor people have no money, and ghosts bully them?</p>
<p>The small send-off also requires returning after midnight. According to the rules, we cannot stay overnight in the host's house. No matter how late it is, how far the journey is, or how bad the weather is, you must go home to rest. In the severe winter with snowy weather, in the middle of the night, we often have to walk twenty or thirty miles in the mountains with a small lantern. The body is extremely tired on the road. The whole day is spent singing, doing hand gestures, and walking. The whole day is spent breathing in incense, paper ash, and oil fumes. Your head is already dizzy, and you still have to stumble through the snow, braving the wind and rain, to walk this dark, lonely, and rugged mountain path. Naturally, we are the ones who capture and send away ghosts, and we eat ghost rice all day long. But when you are on this desolate and uninhabited high mountain, in this place filled with graves, can you not be frightened, afraid that demons will harm you and take revenge on you?</p>
<p>Every family in the village has an altar for gods and Bodhisattvas. The altar gods are specifically in charge of the life, death, and diseases of cattle, horses, and livestock. The farmers' hopes throughout the year are "abundant harvests" and "thriving livestock." Therefore, every year there is a "small celebration" for the altar gods who govern livestock, and every three years there is a "big celebration." Small celebrations only require inviting two or three Duangong. Big celebrations require a dozen or so Duangong. It also lasts from two in the afternoon until dawn the next day. Celebrating the altar is entirely a celebration, and it also includes some nonsensical dramas and songs. During the celebration, a pig must be killed, covered with incense and candles, and offered before the altar gods. We love the business of celebrating the altar, partly because the work is easy and enjoyable, and partly because the rewards are rich. In addition to a peck or two of fragrant rice and one to three chickens and ducks, you can earn more than ten thousand copper coins per person. But there is also one of the most cruel things: bloodletting. The Duangong must use the sharp tip of the knife used to kill the pig to prick his own head, draw blood and drip it into a wine glass, mix it with wine, and sprinkle it in the cattle pen and pigsty. In this way, the livestock will not be infected with the plague and will grow "uniformly." The procedure of bloodletting is mostly done by apprentices. Although the teachers receive rich fragrant rice and profits, they are unwilling to shed blood. Before bloodletting, a piece of hair must be shaved off the head, the top of the head is warmed with hot paper ash, and a few cups of hot wine are drunk. Then, one kowtows and prostrates before the altar gods, silently chanting incantations, before using the tip of the knife to prick the head. I had never drawn blood before, and I was not very afraid when I first heard my teacher's comfort, saying that if you are pious in your heart, it won't hurt at all. But after the second and third times, almost once a month, I felt very frightened. No matter how I prayed, how sincere I was, the knife was unbearably painful when it pricked my head. My hand holding the knife trembled constantly, but for the sake of money and the teacher's orders, I had to sacrifice. We Duangong fear this kind of "surgery" and bloodletting work.</p>
<p>Another of our duties is to perform "Dao rituals." Some are for temple fairs to deliver wandering souls of the past, doing "water and land Dao rituals," "reciting yellow scriptures," and "performing clear singing," but most are to "do meritorious deeds" for the deceased of a certain family. When the deceased has just breathed their last, the Duangong holds a "leading banner" and sings in front of the deceased, which is called "opening the road," to guide the deceased to the underworld. After opening the road, there is "reciting scriptures," "sending the funeral," and so on. If the deceased is a woman, then there must be "breaking the prison," opening hell and rescuing the deceased from hell. This imitates the story of Mulian rescuing his mother. Women must have deep sins and be beaten into "Avici Hell."</p>
<p>Our kind of life is generally very bitter. At night, we are afraid of being disturbed by ghosts and cannot sleep, and we also have to "operate" and draw blood. But when we encounter virtuous hosts, their treatment is very generous. There are three or four meals of wine and food every day, tea and snacks, and fragrant rice and profits when leaving. Afterwards, when we meet in the street market, they still invite you to drink tea and wine, and you are also quite respected. However, if you are "Da Xiaosong" for someone, and the deceased happens to die at this time, then the patient's family will be sorry for you, thinking that your Taoist skills are not high and cannot drive away evil. They will immediately drive you out, and naturally you will not receive any reward. Now the countryside is even more impoverished. There are still people doing small send-offs, but there are fewer families beating gongs; there are still small celebrations, but there are fewer big celebrations; some people only open the road when someone dies, and rarely do Dao rituals, and some even don't even open the road because too many people have died. Therefore, our business is gradually declining.</p>
