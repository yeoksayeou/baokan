<h3 id="c18">最近東南歐政局的動盪 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 朗</p>
<p>最近的歐洲政局簡直像一個萬華筒使我們局外的人看了眼花淆亂辨別不出它的眞像來英意二國間因東非事件而起的鬥爭以及法德二國間因萊茵問題而起的衝突固然是這萬華筒中的主要表現而最近東南歐形勢的演變也是含有重大意義而値得我們注意的現在就這問題來簡略地分析一下</p>
<p>最近東南歐政局之最重要的發展就是波蘭匈牙利與南斯拉夫三國間相繼舉行外交協商如上月二十七日波蘭外長柏克上校聘問南斯拉夫京城與該國內閣總理兼外長史多雅第諾維區商談二国間的經濟問題及對歐洲政局的意見在波南二國外交談判以前波蘭前總理谷西亞戈夫斯基也曾於四月二十三日報聘匈京勾留三日之久同匈總理商定三稱政治經濟協定的締結這三個國家的外交談判在歐洲的整個政局上說有什麽意義呢簡單的說這是德國企圖伸展其勢力於東南歐而另行結成一個侵略者集團的表現是對法國與蘇聯等國和平勢力的進攻其幕後的發動者實爲抱有建立第三帝國野心的德國</p>
<p>德國自從希特勒上台以後就厲行其預定的第三帝國的雄心在東南歐方面允急謀伸展其勢力一九三四年一月間德波不侵略條的的締訂解决了二國問多年的糾紛而使波蘭成爲第三帝國防守與進攻鮑爾雪維克主義的外圍收回失地主義老的匈牙利向爲打破現狀陣錢中的要角早同德國發生密切的關係至波匈二國的利益非但不相衝突而且還是相同的（匈國要向小恊的國收回失地波蘭要保護捷克境內的波蘭少數民族）所以經過德國的拉攏自然極易携手合作前年十月匈總理貢波斯就先聘問波蘭京城華沙今年四月波總理又報聘匈京因之二國間的關係就更形密切了</p>
<p>但是爲小協的國之一的南斯拉夫現在爲什麼也會被他們看中而予以拉攏呢原來小恊約國是法國包圍德國之有力外圍德國要想伸展其勢力於東南歐就非先行分散這一團結的勢力不可德波的拉攏南斯拉夫就是這個分散法國外圍勢力的表現德波二國對於南斯拉夫本來沒有什麽重大的利益衝突不過匈牙利同南斯拉夫的關係向來非常惡劣所以要想拉攏南斯拉夫就非先行消除他們間的宿仇不可這决波蘭外長的訪問南國京城就是負有這種重大的使命的南斯拉夫果將捨棄其結合多年的捷克羅馬尼亞而投入德國主動的集團嗎這是要看匈國讓步的程度如何而定的現在匈南二國間最主耍的衝突就是匈國要收回戰後割給南國的克羅地省等地依據匈國政府的最近態度頗有暫時放棄收回南國失地的傾向例如極力替匈國利益辯護之英國農黨領袖羅塞米爾於四月二十一日在匈京各報發表一文力主收回割給捷克與羅馬尼亞的失地而對於割給南斯拉夫的克羅地省等地則並未提起這顯然可以表明匈國有放棄收回失地而同南國携手的傾向至於南國的態度現在雖然還沒有顯明的表示但如匈國能够讓步自然也有同它們接近的可能</p>
<p>綜上所述可知德國現在已在積極伸展其勢力於中南歐並且已有相當的成效要是德波匈南的勢力能有更進一步的結合時則法國與蘇聯的和平勢力必將遭受極大的打繫而法德二國間的鬥爭也必因此更形銳化歐洲和平的前途更要黯淡無望了</p>

<p>和平主張　我法國同志、均能忠於主義、不惜以生命為殉、日後苟以此輩為政府之喉舌、作登高之一呼、全歐洲必將羣起饗應、抑吾曹所主張之和平、公允而平等、完整而眞實、不可分割而具有實效、一言以蔽之、係解除武裝的和平、此其主張自必有人加以饗應、吾曹旣為第二國際之社會主義者、對於本黨以及第二國際莫不矢忠不貳、自較任何人更有資格、以揭櫫和平之義也、</p>

<p>日內瓦通訊、國聯本届行政院會議、共開會三次、其性質雖為一種常會、但因義阿糾紛、情勢益趨嚴重、行政院之視綫、似專注射在該問題、故於第一二兩次會議、均未能付諸討論、更因行政院報吿員義大利代表阿洛錫（Aloisi）氏為反對義阿糾紛問題、列於議程、憤而離席返國、故報吿書直至最後一次會議、始再審査、主席艾登、（Eden）於義代表退席之前曾徵求其意見、義代表當時表示同意於報吿增加兩席之提議、惟不主張在行政院作何决議、以留待九月大會解决、故行政院除將報吿書及各代表所參加之意見、轉呈大會外、未作何種决議、但行政院之意見、足為大會解决上述問題之標準、可無疑義、尤按國聯過去情形推察、凡能在行政院通過之問題、大會無不接受、不過所待大會解决者、僅在三年或一年之爭執、抑亦我國與葡萄牙一年與三年之競爭、簡言之若我為三年、則葡為一年、反之、或兩席俱為一年、觀察行政院發言者、均同情三年於我、一年於葡、為國聯正義及其普遍合作、行政院固應有此種態度、亦郭使兩年進取之結果也、吾人惟望此際發言代表、保守信義、於九月大會將來匿名投票時、不作狡猾企圖耳、抑國聯實力之微弱、已為世界所共見、其威信掃地、盟約失效、亦為輿論所公認、在此種情勢之下、不圖具體改善、惟有坐待崩潰也、在吾人方面、對於國聯如不感有利、則亦無參加的價値、倘欲從事週旋、固當取積極態度、故吾人甚望郭使於百尺竿頭、更進一步、蓋吾人雖不能望得常任理事、但如果以兩年光陰之努力、僅取得一年任期、將來席猶未暖、又須競爭、不免在極短期間內、又增加一番困難也、記者於此、謹將行政院代表參加意見者、爰述之於下、以供讀者參考、</p>
<p>主席艾登（Eden）謂、義犬利代表之報吿、業已提交行政院、該報告謂委員會贊成增加兩席、一席給與亞洲國家、另一席給予非屬於集團之歐洲國家、委員會同意於一九三六年使中國再入行政院、報吿員並提議該問題祗能在大會解决、行政院不作具體决議、</p>
<p>葡萄牙代表於表示贊成我國參加行政院外、謂依照委員會之提議、亞洲等於兩席、（記者按係指土耳其為屬於亞洲）、如一席給與歐洲非集團國家、則共為十四席、該報吿書似有不實、而該提議旣為臨時性質、則三年時間、不免太久、</p>
<p>土耳其代表謂、應按行政院常例、給與新任理事、任期三年、彼尤表同情於中國再入行政院、</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞代表則謂、彼久望中國參加行政院、以補行政院缺乏亞洲代表之遺憾、今能給與中國席位、彼甚感快慰、但關於歐洲非集團國之臨時席位、則主張以一年為限、</p>
<p>蘇俄代表李維諾夫謂、行政院各理事、業已同意給與中國臨時席位、彼甚滿意、但關於歐洲非集團國之臨時席位任期、祗可規定一年、故彼提議給與中國三年、葡萄牙為一年、</p>
<p>葡代表於是進一步表示謂、彼個人在原則上亦贊成中國三年任期、但為此種臨時辦法、尤以特殊情形關係、可規定為一年、葡代表之意、蓋不欲給與我國三年、彼則一年也、行政院通過報吿書、並决議連同各理事之意見、移交大會、而兩年以來、經過不少曲折變化之問題、至此始吿一重要段落、（中央社）</p>

<p>紗市趨疲、略現跌風、蓋以華北環境惡劣、人心稍形空虛、市價不振、但某方面之多額仍無舉動、故跌勢尙屬和緩、十一月期紗多說利空、上場空方又形活動、現紗蜀帮進胃尙好、</p>

<p>— （方叔俊）</p>
<p>「世」界上只有不可做的事，决無不能做的事」，故一人須認淸目標堅定志向，越是危險的時候，我們的意志越要堅定，從幹的中間求得人生眞正的樂趣，拿出幹的精神，打破困難和障碍，去達到終極的目的。</p>
<p>威廉第二說：「愈困苦，愈堅定」，能有這樣幹的精神，則一切迎刃而解，雖有萬分之艱難困苦，抱着「種種煩惱皆爲我練心之助，種種危險皆爲我練胆之助，」未有不灑然自得，何阻之有焉，也就是「危險是我們自强的機會」的鐵證。</p>
<p>人生的道路，如登階梯然，一步難一步到最後的關頭，若是不努力絕難達到頂端，故「功虧一簣」是最痛心的事。</p>
<p>天下最可憐的是沒有母親的孩子，然而最有希望的，也是沒有母親的孩子，故一人能從困苦中奮鬥起來，這人必定是高貴的善於支配環境的人。</p>

<p>中國敎育的不發達，是無法吾認的；但對這個『慢』的敎育，却是再普遍再認眞沒有。因之，不論朝野上下，男婦老幼，都把這個慢字奉做立身處世的金科玉律，一直到現在，兀是停滯在慢的狀態中，而且有變本加厲於今爲烈之概。</p>
<p>譬如：一個小孩在學步的時侯，大人們總是常在警吿着『慢慢呌走』，『慢慢呌跑』，這當然爲了孩子步履的安全，避免蹉跌的危險，但這『慢慢』的一種敎訓，已深印到孩子的腦海中了；平時和一個親友分別，或送客出門，打頭和臨末的話，也總不外說是『慢走』，『慢去』，這自然也是好意，爲的是恐怕對方太勞苦了；再如：在舊小說或戲劇中，以及普通塲合的　口頭上，也得隨時可以聽到『且慢』，『慢來』的口吻，聽到這種口吻時，又可想見他們是多麼的閒暇呀，此外：寗波人的『柴急煞』，我們南方人的『慢』！『慢』『慢慢的吃』，『慢慢的做』，也都是平常不過的善意的勸吿　。……允可貴的在聖書賢傳上，亦有許多關於『慢』的昭示：『徐行後長』，便要讚美你懂得客氣，要是『孳孳爲利』，那老實要派你是跖之徒了。（筆者並非反對聖訓，實因後入多有誤解聖書，用之不當）。關於這種慢的敎育，在家庭，在社會，在書本，旣這樣的認眞，普遍，自然會養成中國入慢的根性，慢的習慣，傳統的做着慢的信徒，一惟慢是奉行，而甘於慢，安於慢了。</p>
<p>然則，眼前的一切，——上至國家大事，下至個人學業，也何怪都要擱淺在『慢慢呌』中；只怕會有一天，人家要來干涉你慢，唉　眞的那個敢信沒有這麼一天——慢的末日的來臨。</p>

<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>每一個畫面，所少不了的，是若干可以分析開來的綫條，曲的，直的，粗的，細的。</p>
<p>譬如一個都市，骨幹是直綫條的大建築。但是在直綫條的大建築之中，總得栽上幾株曲綫條的引道樹，以調劑着人類視神經中，所反映出來的枯燥的印象。所以在大馬路，四馬路一帶，很少有人在那裏散步，反之，如霞飛路，愚園路等處，便儘有的是女的挽着男的臂，男的摟着女的腰，邊說邊笑，邊走着的。爲的是在霞飛路，愚園路，那些所在，有立體式的建築，有農村式的園林。在同一個畫面中，有直綫條，有曲綫條，有粗的錢條，有細的綫條，不像在大馬路，四馬路一帶，所見的，完全是像橱兒，櫃兒，箱兒，匣兒，那麽的似乎是一個幾何學的畫面。</p>
<p>不錯，每一個美麗的畫面，不可少的，是曲綫，但同時，也需要直錢，不可少的是細的綫條，但同時，也需要粗的綫條。所以在一個荒山之中，得安放上一個用直綫組成的浮圖。名勝之區，總少不了幾個用直錢組成的廟宇。用曲錢組成的河流上面，得架上一個用直錢組成的石板橋。可以吸引遊人的風景區中，若能在綠暗紅稀的山林掩映之地，藏着一二宅立體式的大飯店，準可更使遊人，有說不出的好感。正如在完全用直錢條組成的都市中，滑着幾輛流綫型的汽車，覺得呆滯的目光，爲之感受着不少的刺激。</p>
<p>因此，在這年頭兒，方肩兒的紳士們，得鑒賞着富有曲綫的女性，那才能湊　成一個曲綫條和直綫條，凑合而成的一個美麗的畫面。同時，每一摩登女性的臉兒，也得請美容專家研究着以决定某部該改造成直錢，某部須改造成曲線，方能相稱。瞧哪，就這小小的二道眉兒，有的是直線形的，有的是曲綫形的，面貌的美麗與吾，第一個條件，自然也須注意着直線條，曲錢條，粗綫條，細綫條的交織得自否相稱。</p>

<p>第二回　芳草麗人天微波乍托　小樓明月夜好夢初溫</p>
<p>國器看了一看，就背了兩手，慢慢的踱出了亭子云。那賣雨花石的，可是在後面叫道：先生，這石頭你不要嗎？我這裏還有好的，便宜賣給你就是了。我們這裏的石頭，比廟上的，可便宜得多。國器回過頭來向他搖了兩搖，表示不要。‘在這一回頭之間，又看到了那姑娘向亭子北看來。彼此雖不知道誰是誰，可是眼晴一接觸着就覺得彼此是至好的朋友。而且他剛才說明芳草天涯，又說的春光是靑年人的，這更可以知道他肚子裹也很有點墨水，不是一朶凡艷，以前把他當了一枝梅花，一剪蘭花，那是很對的。心裏如此想着，眼光倒是不敢去看人家，於是昂着頭，看天上的雲彩，看亭子的瓦擔，甚至亭子上架瓦的橡子，似乎也有些美術的意味，値得去研究的。偶然一低頭正面看了去，這就看到他　山前風景賞鑑的樣子，有意無意的向自己身上看了來。國器也想着，人家是位姑娘呢，還是大大方方的，並不因爲是街頭相遇之人，見面有什麽芥蒂。自己是一個男子倒只管見了人忸怩作態，也放大一些吧？於是搭訕着向那賣雨花石的人笑道：你們在這山上檢的石頭，來得很容易，還要賣兩個銅板一塊，未免太貴了。小販笑道：先生，山上雖然出石頭，檢好的可不容易。國器向這攤子邊走來時，那姑娘同着兩個少婦，也定向那邊攤子上去。他忽然道：嫂嫂，你以爲這些雨花石，是出在這山上的嗎？其實這些石頭，全是南京附近幾縣檢來的。這由上雖然到處都有小石頭子，好的很少。必定要下過一陣大雨之後，把山土冲洗動了，才露出許多石頭子，可以挑幾顆好的石頭來。他一面向嫂嫂們說話，面向等子四週看着。他是很大方的，對國器所站的這一方看了云。若說他是有意看人，他的眼光，並不專利射到人身上。若說他不是看人，他那眼光，很靈活的向這邊一轉。護人身受到，有一種說不出的快感。可是他只僅僅的在石子攤邊，對這邊有那一剎那的注意。便聽得那少婦說了一聲走罷，他們三人就雛開這亭子了。走的時候，他步子是移得　常的緩，由最前一個走，落到最後　個，而且雕開了那兩位　嫂很　的地方，走幾步就回頭看上　詪　直到山脚　轉彎的暫　，才不看見他回頭了。（五九）</p>

<p>至於商業，自橡膠跌價，經營斯業之僑商，慘遭失敗，大部份橡膠園地，悉落外人手中，其影響於商業上至大且鉅。且英人近年對於經營橡膠之僑商，監視頗嚴，加以種種不合法律及不公平之限制，如規定某區不許爲華僑購置地產等等。而我僑胞愛國心素熱，深冀國家安定，自强不息，庶旅外僑商不致冉受人之凌侮也。市上商店所售之貨物，大都均係日貨，或明明貼有英國貨脾子，實際亦係改頭換面者。時余因大氣甚熱，擬購三友實業社出品之短袖襯衫，顧該地祇有僑興國貨公司一家，而遍尋又無三友物品。且該公司所陳列之貨物，均龐雜不齊。余詢以國內國貨甚多，何不向國內各大公司訂購批售？據店中職員答稱，實因國貨定價太高，無人問津，勢必至於虧本也。觀此，則國貨之不能向外發展，有由來矣。又，僑胞人數雖多，但無具體組織，有之亦僅如會　或同鄕會之類而已。對於如何發展經濟，商業以及整個華僑事業之研討機關，尙付缺如，甚可憂也。</p>
<p>橋胞向分「僑生」，「外江」二派。外江僑胞均諳木國文字，僑生僑胞祇受英人所辦學校敎育，不請本國文字。去歲因生活關係，不幸發生糾紛。惟僑生僑胞現知祇受英文敎育，不足謀生社會，已自辦補習本國文學校一所，藉以補救，此一好現象也。至於僑胞整個敎育，仍不普及，雖有小學三百餘所，而中學僅有華僑男子中學一所，女子四所。且敎育行政方面常受英人種種牽制，如中學校長敎員須得英人同意後始能充任，小學亦然。課本亦須受英人之干涉，直言之，不啻英人所施之奴化敎育政策。以是僑胞之富於愛國心者，在經濟可能範圍之內，寗願將子弟送至國內求學，以免爲英人敎育政策所麻醉也。竊以上海眞如曁南大學爲敎育僑胞子弟而設，學校當局自應認眞敎導，允應對於如何發展南洋華僑經濟，事業以及貿易等之特種敎育，加以注意，以期茂育英才，培植僑商新戰士，以所學爲所用，方不辜負我僑胞一番熱望也。</p>
<p>僑胞素以忍苦耐勞著稱，然亦有沉迷烟賭者，英當局名雖應以爲禁，實則多方放縱，若以英當局烟稅收入一項祭之，即可瞭然。烟稅收入最多時，年逢三千一百萬。一九三一年减至六百萬，至前年又增至八百萬。一九三三年會一度開始登記，吸烟者達五萬九千人，本年登記則减至二萬六千四百餘人。表面似已减少一半，惟據熟悉情形者云，吸烟者十萬人尙不止也。</p>

<h3 id="c238">日本端午節的鍾馗 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>端午節是我國舊曆的節氣，但是也被日本抄襲了去，改在陽曆的五月五日。日本目從廢除了我國的陰曆之後，便將所有的節氣，跟着陰曆計算。因此我國端午節所必要的枇杷，在陽曆是難於嘗着的。日本在端午節沒有什麽舉動，他們最看重的是廟會日和各種國家紀念日而已。</p>
<p>到了五月裏，日人便將布製的鯉魚，和風車，掛在竹竿上，不知什麽意思。那鯉魚是空的，風從魚嘴裏次進去肚皮便漲大起來。乘風飄動，很像跳躍游泳的樣子。大約在五月之前的空中，是風箏的世界，五月中是鯉魚，到六月以後，便是看東洋熖火時候了。</p>
<p>日本稱泥人洋囝囝等，都名之為「人形」，五月裹流行的是「武者人形」。有他們神武天皇的肖像，穿着繡花袍。黑色朝靴，五綹長鬚，蓄髮無冠。有的在左右打兩個丫髻兒，有的束髮於頂，完全是我國古人的氣概。並且背插羽翎，腰佩倭刀，更是古代武將的風度。不過左用握一長杖，頂上槃着一隻老應。在神武天皇的右邊，一定有一個鍾進士的肖像，同樣的被日本人崇拜着。想不到在我國端午節無人顧問的鍾馗，在日本却大受歡迎，正式實行中日親善起來了。</p>
<p>鍾進士在什麼時候，東渡日本的，恐不容易考據了。况且黑炭團的面孔，到了日本，已變爲紫棠色。但是頭上仍舊戴着尖翅的紗帽，穿的並非紅袍，和他們神武天皇一樣的繡花蟒袍。滿臉虬髯，握着一柄長劍，很是威風。兩個人形的背後，放着一排刀槍旗幟的架子，旗上也畫着他們的肖像。此外有銅鼓弓矢，以及各種的擺設。人形的前面有一副日本盔甲，坐在獸皮的上面，和我國虎皮寳座一般。全副人形，價在三十元之上，非中等階級以上，恐難購買了。</p>
<p>到了近端午的時候，客堂裏便要掛着鍾馗的立軸。完全照人形樣子畫的，也不是黑面孔。旁邊也沒有蝙蝠和五鬼，冷淸之至。和日人談起鍾進士，他們因爲從小便看見他在日本的，已經不知道是中國人了。就是我國留學生，見了這紅臉的人形，也要認不出是我國純國產的鍾進士了。</p>
<p>端午日用蒲葉艾草，掛在門上。浴堂的水裏，也放着幾枝藥草，都和我國相同。果子店裹出售着細長的筆糉，宛如在國內的景象。說不定在同鄕，還有許多相同的風俗呢。</p>
<h3 id="c239">王太爺別傳 <a href="#c239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>王太爺在亡淸是位秀才，應鄉試且曾薦過卷。王太爺在本鄉是個地主，擁有田數百畝。王太爺在鄉人的眼光中看去，是位了不得的人物，因爲他曾讀過聖賢書。</p>
<p>鎭上有爿茶館，是王太爺的辦公處。　他鎭日獨據一桌，坐在那里，高談闊論：不是說捐稅太苛，定是說人心不古，口沫四濺，穢痰亂吐。他憧憬着唐虞三代之盛，他痛恨着用夷變夏之非。他無嗜好，喜吸皮絲惡捲烟。他駡外國貨，雖然茶壺已改熱水瓶，釘靴己易橡皮套鞋　王太爺在一鄉負有重望，所以人人都仰他鼻息的。他會斷家務事，錢債事。他的說話比法院裹的判决書還有效，因爲他能根據聖經賢傳，亡淸律例，正顏厲色地把人說得不敢不從。他又會替人家做狀子，報酬看事情大小而定，雖然還說不上包打官司</p>
<p>王太爺待人接物，是頗有分寸的：對催租委員是一種顏色，對鄉警或鄉長之類又是一副臉孔，至對佃農及有求於他的人則又是一副架子。王太爺走路，堪稱得四平八穩，頗有亡淸大員風範；因此鄉里小兒亂跳在奔，被其父母瞧到，必要訓戒道，「你要學學王太爺」！王太爺上城，常坐小航船。這並非因輪船用夷變夏，爲的是航船便宜；且踱進航船，誰敢不讓坐一邊，幷尊他一聲「太爺」。</p>
<p>贊曰：「王太爺，物來稀；雖不貴，足噓欷」！</p>

<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>這兒，我得補充一句；我在發病的前夕，連把深夜編寫講義，白天敎書上課等等細務都寫上去，不是太繁冗了嗎？其實並不。這種細務小事，往往與疾病的發生，以及發生後的輕重程度，都甚有關係，甚有影響，一個病的發生，必有其發生的前因後果，所謂前因，就是引起發病的原因。大凡發病原因，不外乎：一種是疾病的本身原因，一種是人體環境的原因。這種環境的原因，我們可稱牠的誘因。譬如赤痢，傷寒，牠的本身原因是赤痢菌，傷寒菌；但只靠了傷寒蘭赤痢菌往往還不一定能够使吃過牠的人，個個發病呢，必須還要有第二個的環境原因的帮忙，才靠得住。譬如有時在同桌共食之後，往往某人發生痢疾，發生傷寒，餘人無恙。什麽緣故？我想：或許就因爲發病的人，有了環境原因的引誘，如消化不良，胃酸欠缺，或腸胃發炎，諸如此類份爲誘因，於是一旦吃了傷寒菌赤痢菌進去，就發生了傷寒症痢疾病了。餘人呢，雖或也同樣的吃了病原體（病菌），但因無第二種的誘因，因而不發。就如我這决的扁桃腺炎吧，如其那一晚不爲編寫講義開夜車，次日也不免强着上課，毛病就此不發生，我不敢說；但發生的時光，病勢或許輕了一些，時問或許縮短一點，體溫或許不會這樣高，這都是很可能的哩。可是我這一决單單純純的「紅桃」，着實紅得相當沉重，時問也有相當的長久，所以我寫經過時，便把病的前夕而與病的本身有因果關係的些少事情也寫上了。</p>
<p>或許有人要問：你自己是醫生喲，一點扁桃腺炎，本來並不算如何的大病症，怎麽會任牠發作得這樣厲害，難道不醫不藥，不去診治的嗎？</p>
<p>醫藥，我如何有不用醫藥，不加處治的道理！</p>
<p>講到診病醫藥，我就不得不來順便說一說：一般常人與我們醫生，在心理觀念上，對於這醫藥，有的什麽不同之處。</p>
<p>的確，我們醫生對於診病的心理，對於醫藥的觀念，與一般的常人，有些大兩樣：常人對於診病的觀念，總以爲醫生跑來，一視卽明，一度診察之後，卽有屬何病症的確切診斷交代出來。醫生的本領，賽過張天師，醫生的兩顆眼珠，就是顯微鏡！用藥呢，不消說得什麼毛病用什麽藥品，不是藥到病除，也得藥進病减，是理所應當的事。反過來，醫生對診病，對於用藥，便不是這樣簡單了。輕易診斷的病症，經過一度診察，卽有診斷，卽知其爲何病何症的，固然很多，而且是平常的事；診察了十天八天，而診斷仍然茫然莫測，莫明其妙的，亦屬不少，並非稀罕。論到用藥吧，在沒有診斷的診視期中，只有等待，沒有特殊的對症藥品應用，固然理所當然，卽到診斷明瞭，病情淸楚之後，往往亦不必用何藥品去治療，也並不失爲合理的處治哩。因爲處治疾病，並不專恃藥品，需用藥治時，應用了藥，始見藥的功能，不需藥療時，卽不宜用藥：多用藥品，或皮有違病體。這雖屬是題外的話，但在不明瞭醫藥診病的正確觀念的人們看了，想亦不無有點免好處吧。</p>

<p>二·因勢利導　可以分爲年齡差異和環境差異，因爲年齡大小有別，需要亦各有不同，五六歲與十三四歲的兒童，在心理上的需要慾，是有顯然天壊之分，環境的差異，應注意貧富階級之不同，經濟能力之强弱，而施以適合之敎導，此爲研究健康敎育者，不可不知也。</p>
<p>三·用實例引證　這是一種最有力量實際有効的方法，例如引證××生病之痛苦，××患疾之死亡，在每個兒童心目中，目覩慘狀，耳聞眞情，皆有急迫焦慮之恐怖，所以用實例引證，參以適當之講解，其効果必大。</p>

<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第一五五問）　我們的生活應該怎樣注意？</p>
<p>答　今日都市人民的生活，决不能像古人或鄕下人那般自然簡單。舉凡人事的煩擾，利慾的引誘，思慮的斵剝，在在都有使我們的神經衰弱，健康减退的可能。牙患在文明社會爲獨多，本非偶然，欲達預防之目的，我們必須使健康在水平錢上，積極的改善日常的生活。第一應該防免身心的過勞，常使精神體力，綽有餘裕，要做到這層，必須戒絕不規則的生活，作事休息，皆有定時，凡不正當的娛樂，縱慾失眠忍飢等，皆當嚴禁。第二應該保全消化力，不可暴飲暴食，每餐皆有定時，且須從容慢嚼，不可急率了事。第三應該以樂觀態度處理一切事物。第四應該戒絕烟酒，免得傷胃傷腦。第五應該努力適當運動，以求身心的强健舒適。第六應該設法多得日光和新鮮空氣。日光能增加身體內的維他命，允有益於牙齒。</p>
<p>（第一五六問）　爲什麽要防免疾病的侵襲？</p>
<p>答　一切疾病，多能减退身體抵抗力，卽間接能誘發牙患，神經衰弱，肺病，傷寒，糖尿病，花柳病等，允易引起蛀牙或齒糟膿漏症，我們平日應該防免疾病的侵襲，如不幸得了疾病，應該速治，切勿延誤，以致累及牙齒。</p>
<p>（第一五七問）　經口內服的藥的能够損害牙齒嗎？</p>
<p>答　很多人牙齒有了毛病，以爲服藥過多的緣故。其實並不是這樣，不過含水銀，鉛，鉀，碘，鐵等的內服劑，多服常能誘發口炎及牙根膜炎，應該特別注意。</p>
<p>（第一五八問）　還有什麼事，應該注意的？</p>
<p>答　牙齒的局部防護，也很緊要，不可讓牠受敲擊，不可用牠咬切繩索或硬物，因爲牙齒一生裂縫，就易蛀壊的。</p>
<h3 id="c246">肺結核淺說（九三） <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>空氣對於人們之重要，是無人不知的；他在本症治療上所建樹的成績，已詳淤上章裏面。但我們與其靠空氣來治療本症，還不如藉空氣防禦本症之發生，比較來得更徹底。這是「百尺竿頭，更進一步；」的辦法，每個人們都應該决意遵行的！說起他的方法，那是再簡單不過的，卽每日中務須長時間留居於新鮮空氣中是已。所謂新鮮空氣者，乃指少塵埃煤烟，而多樹木之處所而言。這在都市生活的人們，未免較困難一點，但郊外公園等處所，不妨多流連數决。卽退一步講，通常室外之空氣，雖未見得新鮮，但無論如何，係遠勝於室內；這當然無須代價而可每時日享受的了！</p>
<p>日光爲結核菌之大敵，已詳於上面所述；但他對於本症之貢獻，决不僅限於這一點。他係能刺激身體細胞，俾生理的機能亢進，間接能增進身體時結核菌之防禦力的。通常小兒易罹之腺結核骨結核症，有時衹須日光療法，卽可達到痊愈之目的。假使吾人留居於新鮮空氣中，同時又受日光之照射，則身體防禦力之增進，必要更加顯著無疑。</p>
<p>有許多人們，如果在新鮮空氣中停留過久了，是很容易發生感冒的；此中例證，以我國人爲夥，甚至完全係心理作用，結果疑神疑鬼的。這是一件大不幸之事，補救此種缺陷，祗有從講求皮膚之强練入手。他的方法是：養成多停留於室外之習慣，皮膚時用冷水摩擦（洗面沐浴附），着衣勿過溫暖，寢室勿過溫暖，室內宜開放窗戶，睡時亦宜守開放窗戶之習慣；這種種都應該於孩幼時卽開始履行，俾日後完全成爲習慣，决不至有所顧慮方好。</p>
<p>人們身體營養之良否？對於傳染之防禦係有絕大之關係的。故欲增進人體組織之抵抗力，首須充分供給人體活力之原料，所謂原料，卽營養食物是。肺結核症自不外此例。關於他的發生，有時完全由於營養不良而致，所以人們除日光空氣外，對於營養方面所需，蛋白脂肪含水炭素三者，决不可缺一，並且須適如其分的。食物方面的獸肉及新鮮菜蔬，固應該兼收並蓄，此外含有營養須豐富之牛乳雞蛋等，也須時加光顧方行的。於此作者有不得不解釋者一事。就是近來有一部分人大提倡素食衛生之說，這一種論調，得了不少人的盲從，甚至有一外籍醫師也撰文持此說；這是完全不對的。卽拿肺結核症來說，其獸類的蛋白質，就特別來得重要，而不大好缺乏的。如果說食肉者因動物中必要之麽料與毒汁關係，而易患毒瘤肝病血管變硬等病時；那我們也不妨說：尋常的腸寄生蟲赤痢發生原因，大致和食菜蔬水果等是離不了關係的；但是我們决對不能倡禁止蔬食說，因爲這成完全「因噎廢食」了；那末，所謂素食衛生之說，其異正價値也就可想而知了！所以人們需要的食物，獸肉和菜蔬應該並重，混合攝取（本症患者當然包括在內），决不可爲似是而非之說所誤。</p>
<p>有好多種疾病，是很容易誘發肺結核症的；故爲預防本症發生計，也應該同時注意誘發結核之病症的。這方面首屈一指者，自非呼吸器系統莫屬了！像小兒之扁桃腺炎，氣管枝炎，百日咳，麻疹等，都是最顯明之例證；如果能預防上列諸症之發生，間接就可說，是爲肺結核添一層防禦工作的！此外若流行性感胃，胸膜炎，淋巴腺腫服，痔癢，以及貧血，月經失調，消化不良，等情，都很易誘發本症，當然也須加以嚴密注意的。</p>

<h3 id="c247">給他們一些甚麽？ <a href="#c247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— 希堅</p>
<p>報載：「……海外僑胞，因關懷祖國，紛紛組織考察團，返國觀光，先後來滬者，計有菲律濱華僑考察團，暹羅觀光團，瓜哇泗水華僑觀光團，……等，向僑務關係方面探悉，瓜哇三寳隆現亦在組織一觀光團，計有數十人，其中均係數代僑居海外，從未履國土一步者，……」</p>
<p>在這國難日重，風雨飄搖的現在，一些僑居海外的華僑，能夠先後地組織考察團，觀光團，到這古老的祖國來觀光，的是一件可喜的事。正如一個風燭殘年的老者，能夠看見久未歸家的兒子回來了一樣，內心喜悅，眞是不能形容的。</p>
<p>為了國家的衰弱，華僑到處受人欺凌，驅逐，宰割，可是古老的祖國除了表示難過之外，能夠給他們一點保護安慰嗎？如今他們是那麽懷着一股熱烈的情緒到祖國來觀光，可是這老大的祖國，能給予他們一點甚麽呀！半幅河山變色，敵人耀武揚威，處處瘡痍滿目，一切都使他們失望，除了給他們看見一些高大建築物，新式汽車的都市及一些尙未被人們掠奪去的山水名蹟外，有甚麽可供獻給他們？同時在這繁華都市，山水名蹟背後，正隱藏着無限的慘痛，破產，沒落，人間世的慘劇呀！他們在國外受人壓榨，過着那種非人的生活，而回到故國又是這麽地令人失望，該是如何地悲痛？</p>
<p>華僑是有功於祖國的，孫中山先生革命時，得到他們不少的資助，「一二八」英勇抗敵時，同樣地得到精神物質上的幫助，最近又捐輸不少的金錢來購飛機「航空救國」，這都是他們在海外受盡種種的壓迫，侮辱得來的血汗錢呀，可是，我們給予他們一點甚麽。只不過給他們帶回去一幅破落凋零的印象而已。</p>

<p>— 李一</p>
<p>星期實騐小劇塲第一次公演</p>
<p>眞是說不完的高興，當我隨了擁擠的人潮退出新光大戲院之後，我給這種熱烈的情緒鼓舞着，在路上，和朋友談話的話題，便不自禁的集中在實騐小劇塲的本身和這次演出的三個戲上；到現在執筆想寄下一點意見的時候，我又被重燃起我的熱情，好像我剛踏出戲院子似的。</p>
<p>除了這次演出的三個戲之外，關於小劇塲的本身，本來我也想說一點我的意見，例如上演的目錄，戲院子等等，但是這裏為了篇幅的關係，我想留到別一個機會中去說，這兒呢，就來個按下不表。</p>
<p>至于這次演出的三個戲，「求婚」我是在樓廳上看的，因為距離得太遠，看得不大淸楚，所以想不談「自由」這個戲以前也曾看過，不過沒有演得這度好就是了，也想不談。原因呢，為了經濟篇幅，也因為上演的幾位演員都是都是舞台老將，更兼是所謂電影明星，所以我想留下些篇幅來多談些作為這次上演的重心，而且是「新人」演出的「毒藥」。</p>
<p>「毒藥」的缺點是有的，我同意楚雲先生在談談「毒藥」一文中所提出的　　兩點意見，（見本報五月三十日特刋）尤其是第一點，我以為與其使觀衆大快人心的回去，還不如使觀衆對漢奸增加更大的憤怒來得好，事實上，殺死這樣一個小漢奸，與整個國難又有怎樣大補益，而那個正義感的妹妹在殺死了漢奸之後，試問又是否逃得了敵人的掌握？所以，我們應該使觀衆知道，單單殺死一個仇人是不夠的，我們應該「打碎沙鍋問到底」的認淸，我們當前的巨敵是誰！怎樣的才能打倒我們的敵人。</p>
<p>不過，在劇本恐慌的目前，像這樣的配合着國防戲劇的主流的作品終究是難能可貴的。作者替我們書一下了漢奸的赤裸裸的畫像，也畫下了在重壓下求生存的正義的進步的女性的畫像，這二種不同的人物寄在一起，便越顯得我們所要同情和痛恨的人物來，更且作者章泯先生是一個實際從事於劇運者，本着他豐富的經騐，在對白方面，便很少有浪費或是混淆的地方，而當漢奸要喝毒藥的時候，作者又很巧妙地運用最能抓住觀衆情感的Suspense，欲喝又止的使得觀衆的情緒緊張起來。</p>
<p>演員們雖大都是新人，但是在個性方面却很有把握，這是普遍的一個好感，因為在個性上有把握，所以很使人感到親切眞實，像是東北民衆向我們報吿他們的遭遇似的；更且在化裝上又非常的好，使我們忘記了他們是在台上演戲的演員。</p>
<p>演員們的演技，雖是因為「新人」的關係，經騐上還欠缺一些，但是他們的努力認眞（說得更妥切一些，可以說是設身處地）却差不多把這疵點掩住了，尤其是飾妹妹的沈毅，和飾哥哥的李淸，很能夠顯出他們那種剛毅，堅强，和粗魯狠毒的性格來。</p>
<p>趙丹，王為一，鄭君里，徐韜四君，在這裏演了很不重要的兵士，便衣隊等，一洗一　自以還了不起的「明星」的</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>惡習，這種精神是非常値得我們稱道的。</p>
<p>燈光和置景似乎都有些因陋就簡，這主要的雖然或許是經濟關係，然而我們想得照明和置景在整個戲裏的重要，我們希望以後上演的各個戲裏，能夠需量的設法補救它。</p>
<p>我們熱烈希望下星期有更美滿的成績出現！</p>
<h3 id="c249">琴師 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 唐駿</p>
<p>五月最後的那一天，我們樓上搬來一家新房客，就住在間壁的房間裏。他們三口人，一個中年男子和兩個姑娘；大的約摸十六七，小的看樣子頂多不過十五歲。穿戴得很花梢，很容易被人看作「水性人」。（註）</p>
<p>晚上我在金鋼橋上散步，恰巧同庽的范科員也在欄　邊看河內的夜船，見了我一把扯　，移開嘴上的烟斗，笑微微的跟我說：</p>
<p>「你知道住在你間壁的是幹什麼的嗎？」</p>
<p>「我哪兒會曉得，不過看情形不像正派人！」</p>
<p>「讓我告訴你吧，我很知道他們的底細！」把烟斗在欄杆上磕了一下「那個男的是個琴師，專走斜道兒，兩個姑娘娘都是他的養女，大的是在關東拐騙來的，小的是他給一個女戲子當琴師，那女戲子買來送給他的。他敎兩個姑娘唱京戲，現在他們就在日租界中華茶社　唱，我時常在中華茶社聽到她們唱，上禮拜，我還點那個大姑娘的「玉堂春」來着，啊！唱得好！板是板，眼是眼，又清又脆，簡直不次於梅蘭芳，要是你聽了連骨頭都會酥了！哈哈……」</p>
<p>聽了這篇話我、一聲也沒響，痴呆呆的望着水面上暗淡橋影，心頭給一種壓力侵佔着，直到范科員擠着嗓子細聲細氣的哼着「崇老伯他說是冤枉難辯……」走過橋去，我才下意識的移動了脚步，慢慢的踱回庽所。</p>
<p>睡時已是過半夜了，寂寞開始擁抱夜色，我靜靜的睡着。沒多時歇，一陣樓梯把我驚醒！間壁的門響了，是他們回來啦。</p>
<p>「爸爸，那胡琴忘帶回來了。」</p>
<p>「簡直是存心跟我換搗蛋！我吃苦受難的把你們養大，指望你們掙把衣飯養我老，誰料你們翅膀還沒硬就想飛！妄想吧！老子活着這口氣就掉不了你們手裏！」</p>
<p>接着一陣低泣聲傳來，慘痛的侵凌着我的心，我悄悄的從板壁缝隙裏看过去，那男子恶狠狠的用手揪那大女孩子的腿部和腰部，另一隻手挺着剪刀，祗見那女孩子眼涙直倘雙腿跪在地上求饒。男的眼睛像兇獸似的，剪刀對着她的胸口，意思是说，你要是呌嚷我就扎死你！小女孩子也滿脸血涙的跪在旁邊。</p>
<p>多麼殘忍可怕的事呵！我的心顫動，差一點沒喊出來。當我在被窩裏躺好，汗已經濕遍了全身，我感到這世界的慘酷可怕！</p>
<p>「媽的！不呌你知道點萬害還了得！」</p>
<p>爸爸，我……再不敢……」</p>
<p>「誰不知道陳二爺肯花錢，整年的千把萬的花，給他看上眼的姑娘都發了財，走了紅運，別人燒香禱告還盼不到，你却不答理人家，倒跟小冷子那旁光蛋打蜜！（註）明天你要是不把陳二爺拉回，看我不揭你的皮！」</p>
<p>給生活拋在汚穢中的人們，被踐踏，被侮辱，被損害，永遠沉陷在痛苦的深淵底，負着飢餓的重傷，沒有抗議，沒有掙扎，命運便在黑暗中燬滅！她們多麼可憐呀！恐怕有一天她們會被殺害！</p>
<p>他們睡下不久，女孩子就發出無可忍受的慘痛呻咽，顯然她被强烈的無所節制的獸性所蹂躝！</p>
<p>整夜陷在痛苦的思索裏，我氣忿！想呼喊，但終於忍耐住。</p>
<p>一清早兩個女孩子就起來在樓台上調嗓子，尖細委婉的聲音，由低而高，由高而低，悽楚悲忿的音調不斷的從聲帶裏夾雜出來。當河東禮拜堂的鐘聲敲過，太陽已高掛在半天了，琴師起來漱洗，她們這才停止調嗓子，去屋裏服侍他吃點心，之後那琴師就拉起那只舊的低音胡琴，兩個女孩子輪着練習唱，一遍一遍，掉了板，琴師就罵「心又想什去啦！賤骨頭！」自然又得再唱，唱到「前去出狩……」那兒，他踱着脚罵起來，「你媽的！告訴你好幾遍了，那　「狩」字應該越唱越往下落，到最後一眼　起來，再另唱！於是第二遍第一遍，第……</p>
<p>吃過午飯她們就打扮得乾乾凈凈的跟着他出門，一直到過半夜才回來。幾乎是每夜都聽到女孩子們的哭泣和呻咽。</p>
<p>每天早晨范科員都跑上三樓來蹓躂，見了我總說：「這上面空氣很好啊，能在這兒運動運動才好呢。我知他「醉翁之意不在酒」，所以也就唏唏哈哈敷衍一下。有好幾次我見到他跟那個大女孩子偷偷說話，那是在琴師還睡着的時候。</p>
<p>忽然一天夜裏琴光帶着那小女孩子回來，進門就打她，她又哭又號，他一邊打一邊逼問：</p>
<p>「說實話你姐姐哪兒去啦？不說出來我就宰了你！」</p>
<p>「唱完「汾河灣」她就出去了我不……知道……」</p>
<p>把個女孩子打得半死不活，他出去呌了警察來，將女孩子帶去，這回我看到了那女孩子淌遍涙的沒血色的臉。</p>
<p>第二天范科員不見了，我很疑心？後來我打聽茶房，說范科員呌范冷雲，別人都呌他小冷子，我才明白那個大女孩子是同范科員私逃了。</p>
<p>住了一個禮拜茶房來告訴我：</p>
<p>「間壁那個小姑娘在公安局裏死了。」</p>
<p>註一：「水性人」是指妓女。註二：「打蜜」卽蜜的意思。</p>

<p>— 長風</p>
<p>阿翠達月了，張佃主家特地打小轎來迎她媽到城里去。老婆子剛從田頭上送老伴飯回來，她遠遠地就瞧見了自家門前的小轎，兩名轎夫在樹下用大凉帽扇着胸脯。老婆子最怕見那小轎，她永遠牢記着她女兒阿翠是用小轎抬走送進老虎嘴里去的；到現在一年多，自己兩次上城去都沒有見到女兒一面，老伴去年到倉里還租，千求萬懇張老爺才聽見女兒呌了一聲爸爸。</p>
<p>老婆子想着阿翠脚里就软软地摔不開步子了，那個飯籃提在手里漸漸沉重起來，心里雖然想着從另一頭田岸繞道回自已的後門，但是她那種抖顫的樣子已經被轎夫瞧着了，他們老遠地奔上來，接過她手里的飯籃，冲口稱着老太太，我們老爺接太太進城去，轎子打在門口。</p>
<p>老婆子睜着她的昏迷的眼睛打量着來人，她做夢也沒有想到一個小脚老婆子有做太太的一天的。但是不允許她考慮，兩名轎夫已挾着她走了，像她女兒阿翠被搶進轎里一樣，飛似的抬着走了。</p>
<p>老婆子昏昏觉觉地像鬼迷了心，她不知道自己将要遭逢着什麼危險的事；又像想起了許許多多的事，但是那些事都沒有在她腦海里生根，泡沫似的隨起隨落。轎子抬進了熱閙的城市，她才掙着喊出來：</p>
<p>「噲！你們抬我到那里去？」</p>
<p>前面的轎夫回過頭來打量了她一眼，脚步放慢了一點回答：</p>
<p>「姨奶奶要生產了，接太太去守生呢」。</p>
<p>轎子就一直停在張佃主家門前。那繪着太极圖的照牆，那兩扇黑漆的牆門，老婆子認清楚是老虎嘴的時候，她才聰明過來，要是阿翠生孩子吧？這是個喜訊，老伴知道了也應該該活快活；於是她下意識地回過頭來，但是她老伴沒有跟在後面，後面是把她怱怱抬來的轎夫。</p>
<p>有兩名女僕扶着她進門。種了張老爺十多年田，今天還是第一次走大門，那高廰，天井，走廊，都弄花了老婆子的眼睛。現在她痛恨張老爺的心是轉變過了：她沒有蹧蹋她女兒阿翠，張老爺是沒有兒子的，要是女兒生了個男孩子，這一輩子的福就享用不盡了，自己不是已被稱老太太了嗎？那末，老伴是老太爺；老天保佑他們種田翻了身。</p>
<p>走到土房張老爺招呼她坐了，老婆子對張老爺却想不出一個稱呼來，姑爺兩個字已經到了她嘴邊，但是她不敢喊出來，她注視着姑爺嘴唇上的兩撇八字　，半響，才含混地問：</p>
<p>「阿翠怎末了？」</p>
<p>張老爺抽着雪茄，彷彿沒有聽見她的問話。等女僕送上茶，他才望着内房说：</p>
<p>「阿翠要生養了，要是生个男孩子，你们的造化不小！」张老爺微微笑着。他今年已五十開外了，娶了五房姨太太沒有留得一個種。是前年老婆子的老伴欠了租，地保要找外快，東說西吹把阿翠搶來做張老爺的第六房姨太太。老爺在阿翠房里沒有住上二個月，就把阿翠扔了。等到知道阿翠懷孕，才高興起來。</p>
<p>老婆子想要求進內房去見見女兒，但是她的姑爺祇是在房里踱着，没有她说话的機會。</p>
<p>醫生出來了，張老爺馬上迎上去問怎末了。醫生面上死呆呆的，湊着張老爺的耳朶低聲地說：「姨太太年紀太輕了，胎兒又大，恐怕要用手術，不過保了大就保不了小，保了小保不了大：</p>
<p>『這個，不能兩全嗎？」張老爺鎖起了眉毛。</p>
<p>醫生搖搖頭：「看來是沒有辦法了」！</p>
<p>「那末，保了小的罷：」决斷地。</p>
<p>老婆子聽着突然跳了起來，她抓住了醫生的手：「先生，這不能的！這不能的！要保大人；我的阿翠」。她瞅着張老爺：「張老爺求求你，保了阿翠！可以生養，我老婆子祇有這一個女兒，要保大人」！</p>
<p>慘痛的喊聲從內房送出來，醫生擰了老婆子的手，揚着眉毛徵求张老爺的同意，張老爺低低頭。醫生馬上進內房去了，房門又死緊緊地關着。</p>
<p>老婆子跪到张老爺面前，她祇能喊着要保大人！要保大人！</p>

<p>長得不怎麼矮，面部的側影很像巴比塞的那傢伙，他底眞實姓名我不知道是不是呌馮鏘之，因為有時看到他收下別的名字的信件，有些朋友也時常呌他老蔣的。</p>
<p>因為有點像巴比塞的綠故，他自己常常很得意的樣子，把自己未寫成的文稿拿給別人看，雖然他底大作永遠是「未完成的傑作。」他說：「你看，我就要寫成了，是一篇小說，很受高爾基的影響。」第二天也許變了話：「那篇小說不寫了，要寫詩，眞的，我最近讀了很多詩，自己底詩興也就發起來了，我要把一般民族英雄的故事，用我底燃着火樣熱的情想的筆寫下來，成為一首偉大的詩篇。」聽他底語氣，好像他已經站在百萬的讀者羣里，受着愛戴了。他每天這樣快樂地生活着，在「未完成的傑作」里。用他底低低的鼻音笑着。</p>
<p>朋友們對於他，都採取着漠視的態度。「他會做出什麼來呢？」大家都這樣想。就看他往日的行動吧，也不像一個怎麼能夠辦事的人。我有時也跟朋友站在一條戰綫上，向他發着冷冷的諷刺，甚或帶着嘲笑的口氣说：「喂，大作出版了嗎」他就哭笑地說：「還沒寫成呢」</p>
<p>呌做彬的就揷嘴說：「不要緊，我替你出版，賣了錢完全給你。……」</p>
<p>「不要開玩笑：我正在寫，正在好好的寫呢！」他用低低的鼻音笑著說。然後把手向我們招了招，舉着輕快的步子走了。　「再會！」他喊着，招着手，好像很不好意思的樣子。</p>
<p>我對彬的話加以批評，因為這樣的態度對於老馮是探測不合適的，因為他是一個時常需要別人底鼓勵，功名心很重的人物，太傷他底心的話，會使他對於朋友或自己都失去快樂的感情的。比方他在寫文章，雖然時常不寫完就丟棄了，我們底責任是要使他完成，而不能注定他永遠不會寫成一部作品，不道，彬是一個只會開玩笑的人物，別的，他是不怎麼注意的。所以對於我底意見，他也只是笑了笑。可是，不好的現象終於發現在老馮那傢伙底行為上了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Amidst Rumors in Beiping and Tianjin, the Officials of Hebei and Chahar Issue Statements on Steps to Deal with the Current Situation <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Internally, Unity and Efforts in Construction; Externally, Resolving with Peace as the Primary Goal</p>
<p>Xiao Zhenying and Zhang Zizhong Visit Tashiro to Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>(Beiping) Local authorities here stated their attitude in dealing with the current situation: internal unity, external peace. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Matsumuro and Kawabe, yesterday, responded to Tashiro's invitation and went to Tianjin for consultations. They completed their business and returned to Beiping one after another today. It is rumored that the Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai are actively building barracks. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Due to the increase of Japanese troops in Beiping and Tianjin, rumors suddenly arose. The authorities of Hebei and Chahar have already declared that they have made the greatest determination to strive to maintain local security and proved that the rumors are unfounded. Therefore, people's hearts have gradually stabilized. According to a statement from a certain authority, the current steps to deal with the situation are: internal determination to unite sincerely, strive for local construction, and relieve the people's livelihood, with the aim of upholding righteousness for the country and eliminating suffering for the people; external determination to prioritize peace, based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and respect for sovereignty, in conducting all affairs to achieve the purpose of harmonious neighborly relations. (1st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 8:00 AM on the 1st, Xiao Zhenying and Zhang Zizhong, together, went to Zhang Garden Residence to visit Tashiro, Matsumuro, and Nagami to exchange opinions on recent events in Hebei and Chahar. They left after talking for some time. At 4:00 PM on the 1st, Xiao summoned Sun Weidong and Liu Dongxuan, the chiefs of the Public Security and Social Bureaus, Liu Jialuan, the commander of the Security Force, and Chen Zhongyue, the magistrate of Tianjin County, at the Municipal Government to discuss the arrest of criminals in the bombing case of the Beining Railway, and summoned Section Chief Mu of the 3rd section of the Railway Police to inquire about the truth of the incident, instructing the railway authorities to strengthen prevention in the future. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 12:00 noon on the 1st, Xiao Zhenying hosted a banquet for all sectors of Tianjin at the Municipal Government Garden, with over 40 people attending, including Qi Bianyuan, Gao Lingjue, Cao Rulin, Lu Zongyu, Bian Baimei, and Zhang Boling. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The newly appointed Japanese Consul General in Tianjin, Tajiri Aiyoshi, is scheduled to arrive on the 2nd aboard the Changan Maru. He will transfer to a car at Tanggu and arrive in Tianjin at noon. Deputy Consul Nishida stated that there are many rumors circulating in Tianjin recently, which are purely unfounded. The Japanese side has not taken any action towards North China. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Regiment Commander Kawabe returned to Beiping from Tianjin in the afternoon of the 1st, accompanied by Senior Adjutant Ono. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiao Zhenying has returned here from Beiping. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) When receiving guests this morning, Xiao Zhenying's attitude was quite optimistic. He stated that the situation in North China has eased somewhat. His return to Tianjin is to resume his official duties, it is said. According to sources from the Chinese side here, the unrest of the 29th Army under Song Zheyuan arose from the rumor of the dismissal of Chen Zhongfu, Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Diplomatic Committee. The officers of the army now believe that the authorities are shifting the blame for the failure of diplomacy in North China to Chen. The arrival of Chairman Zhang Zizhong of Chahar with Xiao in Tianjin has aroused much speculation from various parties. A spokesman for the Japanese military authorities stated today that, based on the facts learned after investigating the railway bombing case between Tanggu and Tianjin last night, the Japanese side does not seem likely to take a tough stance. However, if the investigation continues and it is discovered that the dignity of the Japanese military has been affected, then the Japanese side will resort to forceful measures.

<h3 id="e2">Ishii Issues Statement <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>The Railway Bombing Incident is Under Investigation by the Japanese Military; The Number of Increased Troops in North China Cannot be Disclosed; The Japanese Side is Willing to Assist in Suppressing Smuggling</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Senior Staff Officer Ishii of the Japanese Garrison stated that regarding the Beining Railway bombing incident, the military is investigating the truth. If the background is not significant and does not damage the prestige of the Japanese military, it will not become a problem and will certainly not have a major impact. The current priority in North China is to stabilize people's hearts and enable farmers and merchants to live and work in peace. The Japanese military is quite willing to assist the Hebei-Chahar authorities in striving to achieve this. The Japanese military's policy towards North China has long been decided and will not change due to the appointment of Commander Tashiro. After all, policy and personnel are purely two different matters. The increase in troops is to protect Japanese residents. The number cannot be disclosed, but based on the ratio of foreign troops stationed in North China to foreign residents, the current number of Japanese soldiers is only half the number of Japanese residents, which is still far different compared to the Italian soldiers who outnumber Italian residents by a ratio of two to one. Many rumors have arisen from this. It is hoped that they will not be easily believed. The Japanese side has absolutely no intention of invading North China or fighting with any party. The rumors of newly added troops opening the Pinghan Railway and building military factories in Tongxian and Fengtai are also all rumors. The construction of barracks in Fengtai is indeed true, but it is not large. Recently, the troops in that area have been stationed in a warehouse. Building new barracks is also an essential matter. Tashiro will go to Beiping around the 10th of the month to inspect the troops, and after returning, he will travel to Qinhuangdao and Yuguan. Smuggling is a matter that is valued by all parties. The Japanese side is also willing to assist. In his personal opinion, international trade and economic exchange are essential. Recently, numerous drowned bodies have been floating in the Haihe River, numbering several hundred before and after. Outsiders have attributed this to the Japanese military. It is hoped that attention will be paid to refuting such slanderous rumors. The case of a Japanese military officer being beaten to death by British soldiers in Beiping's Hada Men is also under investigation. The results are not expected to be serious. Furthermore, Ishii is scheduled to host a gathering for Tianjin's Chinese reporters within the day. (1st Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Troops in Tianjin Conduct Street Fighting Exercises <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) At 9:00 AM on the 1st, Japanese troops in Tianjin conducted street fighting exercises on Haiguang Temple Front, Shijishima, and Awaji Streets, test-driving newly arrived tanks. More than 300 infantrymen participated. The exercise stopped at 10:00 AM. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Li Tingyu published a notice in various newspapers on the 1st, denying that he had participated in activities outside of the Hebei-Chahar Political Committee under a false pretense. This was because Tianjin's Yi Shi Bao and Er Shi Bao had published an article on the 31st, led by Li, urging Song to quickly realize autonomy. Li specifically and formally denied it.

<h3 id="e5">British Newspaper Comments on Railway Bombing Incident: Similar to the Mukden Incident <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Liberal Party's "News Chronicle" recently commented on some recent events in northern China, stating: "The railway bombing incident on the Beining Railway is exactly the same as the railway bombing near Mukden in 1931. As a result of the previous bombing incident, most of Manchuria was occupied by the Japanese army, and a puppet state was created. This bombing incident happened to occur on the day that Japan's troop increase plan in North China was completed, and at the same time, the Japanese troops stationed in North China were also quietly transferred to the Great Wall area to occupy various key passes. The coincidence is such that, some say that the Japanese government has recently expressed a moderate attitude towards European and American countries. Logically speaking, it should not have aggressive ambitions. However, is this a good sign? Once Japan's piecemeal annexation of China is completed, it may reverse its current attitude."

<p>(Tianjin) Ansell met with Xu Liya, the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, in Tianjin to discuss the establishment of an inspection office. Due to the special environment of Tianjin, it is necessary to conduct a detailed study on whether or not it is necessary to establish one. Ansell will request instructions from the Ministry of Finance based on the results of the study. Furthermore, five inspection offices have been established north of Bengbu on the Jinpu Railway, focusing on inland anti-smuggling. Tianjin is close to the seaport and has customs, so some tax commissioners advocate a gradual establishment to avoid causing unexpected incidents. (1st Dispatch)</p>

<p>American Interests Also Threatened by Smuggling</p>
<p>(Washington) The Washington Star published an editorial yesterday criticizing the North China incident, stating that Japan's decision to launch it again clearly takes advantage of the fact that countries around the world are too busy to care for themselves, so as to ensure that its policy of aggression will not be subject to external resistance. It also stated that the North China smuggling incident affects British loans, which rely on customs duties as part of their guarantees, so London is paying close attention. As for American interests, the various oil companies have already felt a significant threat as a result. (31st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Affected by Smuggling, Taikoo Suspends Seven Steamships <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Taikoo Dockyard Company announced today that seven of its steamships will suspend operations on the Hong Kong-Guangzhou-Shanghai-Tianjin routes. The reason given in the announcement is the depression of coastal commerce, but it is rumored that the internal cause is that a certain party has been engaged in large-scale smuggling recently, which has destroyed legitimate transportation businesses. It is feared that there will be dozens of British seamen who have lost their jobs as a result. Other shipping companies also acknowledge the seriousness of the situation, saying that the result may be the continued suspension of several steamships operating coastal shipping routes. Hong Kong's Dianwen News reported this news in the afternoon today, causing a great shock in Hong Kong. It is rumored that most of the crew members of all the ships that have stopped operating hope to find service on other ships. The authorities are now making every effort to reduce the impact felt by these people. (1st Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e18">The Recent Turmoil in Southeastern Europe <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>The recent European political situation is simply like a kaleidoscope, making us outsiders dizzy and unable to discern its true appearance. The struggle between Britain and Italy caused by the East African incident and the conflict between France and Germany caused by the Rhine issue are, of course, the main manifestations of this kaleidoscope, but the recent evolution of the situation in Southeastern Europe also contains great significance and is worthy of our attention. Now, let's briefly analyze this issue.</p>
<p>The most important development in the recent political situation in Southeastern Europe is the successive diplomatic consultations held between Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia. For example, on the 27th of last month, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck visited the capital of Yugoslavia and discussed economic issues and opinions on the European political situation between the two countries with the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Yugoslavia, Stojadinović. Prior to the diplomatic negotiations between Poland and Yugoslavia, former Polish Prime Minister Koscialkowski also visited the Hungarian capital on April 23rd, staying for three days, and agreed with the Hungarian Prime Minister to conclude a political and economic agreement between the three countries. What is the significance of these diplomatic negotiations between the three countries in the overall European political situation? Simply put, this is a manifestation of Germany's attempt to extend its influence to Southeastern Europe and form another group of aggressors. It is an attack on the peaceful forces of France and the Soviet Union, and its mastermind is Germany, which harbors the ambition to establish a Third Reich.</p>
<p>Since Hitler came to power in Germany, he has vigorously pursued his predetermined ambition of a Third Reich. In Southeastern Europe, he is urgently seeking to extend its influence. The signing of the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact in January 1934 resolved the long-standing dispute between the two countries and made Poland a defensive and offensive periphery of the Third Reich against Bolshevism. The old Hungary, with its revisionist aspirations, has long been a key player in the movement to break the status quo and has already developed close relations with Germany. Moreover, the interests of Poland and Hungary are not only non-conflicting but also the same (Hungary wants to recover lost territories from the Little Entente countries, and Poland wants to protect the Polish minority in Czechoslovakia). Therefore, after Germany's wooing, it is naturally easy to join hands. In October of the year before last, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös first visited the Polish capital, Warsaw. In April of this year, the Polish Prime Minister returned the visit to the Hungarian capital, and as a result, the relationship between the two countries became closer.</p>
<p>However, why would Yugoslavia, one of the Little Entente countries, now be targeted and wooed? Originally, the Little Entente countries were a powerful periphery for France to encircle Germany. If Germany wants to extend its influence to Southeastern Europe, it must first disperse this united force. The wooing of Poland and Yugoslavia by Germany is a manifestation of this dispersion of France's peripheral forces. Poland and Germany originally had no major conflicting interests with Yugoslavia. However, Hungary's relationship with Yugoslavia has always been very bad, so in order to woo Yugoslavia, it is necessary to first eliminate the long-standing feud between them. Therefore, the Polish Foreign Minister's visit to the capital of Yugoslavia carried this important mission. Will Yugoslavia abandon its alliance with Czechoslovakia and Romania, which has lasted for many years, and join the group actively promoted by Germany? This depends on the extent of Hungary's concessions. The main conflict between Hungary and Yugoslavia now is that Hungary wants to recover the province of Croatia and other places ceded to Yugoslavia after the war. According to the recent attitude of the Hungarian government, there is a tendency to temporarily abandon the recovery of lost territories from Yugoslavia. For example, the leader of the British Country Party, Lord Rothermere, who has strongly defended Hungarian interests, published an article in the Hungarian newspapers on April 21, advocating the recovery of territories ceded to Czechoslovakia and Romania, but did not mention the province of Croatia and other places ceded to Yugoslavia. This clearly shows that Hungary has a tendency to abandon the recovery of lost territories and join hands with Yugoslavia. As for Yugoslavia's attitude, although there is no clear indication yet, if Hungary can make concessions, it is naturally possible for them to approach each other.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that Germany is now actively extending its influence to Central and Southern Europe and has already achieved considerable results. If the forces of Germany, Poland, Hungary, and Yugoslavia can be further combined, then the peaceful forces of France and the Soviet Union will suffer a great blow, and the struggle between France and Germany will inevitably intensify as a result. The future of European peace will be even more bleak and hopeless.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Chiang Kai-shek's Speech: Students Should Use Summer Vacation to Serve Society <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of education is to cultivate talented individuals with practical knowledge and skills, fostering a spirit of labor and service, and developing the ability to work practically.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang attended the Capital Lecture Hall at 4:30 PM one day to give instructions. The topic was "Students Should Use Summer Vacation to Serve Society." The original text is as follows: "Today, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to gather with principals, teachers, and students of various schools at the Capital Lecture Hall. As the summer vacation is approaching, I would like to take this opportunity to briefly present my views on how students of various schools should rest and serve society during the summer vacation. Please pay attention. In my opinion, students of all secondary and higher education institutions, whether they are graduating this term or still studying, should take advantage of the summer vacation to engage in practical social service work. It is hoped that the school authorities will closely contact the New Life Movement General Association and social service organizations to discuss various concrete and feasible methods for appropriate social service work. Before the vacation, each student should select one or two types of work according to their interests and contribute their talents and knowledge to serve society under the guidance of the school and the New Life Movement General Association. It is also stipulated that each student should submit a detailed report on their summer work and experience when the autumn semester begins. School principals and teachers should provide detailed guidance. In this way, I believe that not only will the entire society and the general public benefit greatly, and the students will make great progress, but also our general faculty and teachers will gain a lot of practical knowledge. As the saying goes, 'Learning is for application.' This means that the purpose of our learning is to apply it for the benefit of society, the country, and our compatriots. Therefore, all knowledge should be practical, and the method of learning should also focus on practice. For example, those who study engineering must practice in factories, those who study agriculture must experiment in farms, and law students must engage in practical social work. Only in this way can they gain practical experience in their jobs, understand the actual situation in society, and develop the necessary spiritual cultivation, so that they can corroborate and integrate with pure intellectual knowledge from books. Only in this way can all knowledge be handled with ease and used freely, and then can they serve the society and the country and achieve something. Therefore, in all kinds of education abroad, the time for experimentation and practice is more than twice as long as the time for theoretical lectures in the classroom. Therefore, after graduation, students can serve in their jobs with ease and without being unfamiliar or facing difficulties. At present, due to the habits and systems of our country's schools, it is not possible for students to have sufficient in-school experimentation and out-of-school practice opportunities in various aspects of society. The government and school authorities should quickly find ways to remedy this shortcoming. It must be known that the purpose of education is to cultivate talented people with practical knowledge and skills, and not to produce students who have knowledge but no use. The number of unemployed high school or university graduates is truly alarming. The reason for their unemployment is that half of it is due to the failure of society and the country to make full use of them, and the other half is due to the students themselves. One of the most common points is the lack of practical work experience and ability, a lack of understanding of the real situation of society and the psychology of the people, as well as the poor conditions in rural areas and general customs. They may even not know how their individual relates to events and society. Therefore, even if they have jobs, they cannot fulfill their duties well, and there are many unemployed people. Now, we are using the summer vacation to engage in social service work as an effective way to remedy this shortcoming. It is hoped that school principals, teachers, and students will pay special attention and not miss this best opportunity for practice. The above is only from the perspective of education and the self-cultivation of young people. In terms of the revolutionary cause of transforming society, building the country, and revitalizing the nation, this kind of service work is even more necessary. The scope of society is very broad, and the situation in society is very complex. If we want to transform it in the shortest possible time, it is not something that can be done by a few government officials and a few orders. It is necessary for intellectuals to use their patriotic and national-saving enthusiasm, and their spirit of sacrifice and hard work, to automatically throw themselves into the most impoverished society and delve into the most painful people, to observe, investigate, and study everything on the spot, and to guide everything on the spot and improve it at any time. For example, public health, mass education, common sense of production, the meaning of cooperation, etc., can all be explained in detail so that they can thoroughly understand. In this way, they can further improve their knowledge, morality, and the spirit of a new life, and they can improve their actual lives. Then, we can achieve the great success of social innovation, people's livelihood, and the revitalization of the nation. Two years ago, I sent ten middle school students in Jiangxi to serve on the worst Nanxun Railway during the summer vacation. In less than two months, the entire railway was completely renewed. Whether it was neatness, cleanliness, speed, accuracy, or all the rules and order, it was above the average railway. The effectiveness of young students serving society can be seen from this. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said, 'Hands are omnipotent.' If students from various schools can follow this principle and use this year's summer vacation to work and serve society, I believe that their contribution to society and the country will be immeasurable. During their student days, they can cultivate the spirit of labor and service and the ability to work practically. In the future, when they graduate and leave school, their service work will surely have extraordinary achievements. The great cause of building the country and revitalizing the nation is not the responsibility of extraordinary people, but of you, young students. As for the service methods and work subjects, the New Life Movement General Association has already formulated concrete methods. I have sent people to contact various schools, and I hope that the principals and students of various schools will also closely connect with the New Life Movement General Association to achieve mutual assistance and cooperation. This is especially hoped for." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e21">National Coal Industry Conference Opened Yesterday at the Ministry of Industry <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Chairman Wu Dingchang delivered a speech, proposing joint sales methods.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Coal Industry Conference convened by the Ministry of Industry opened at 10:00 AM on the 1st at the Ministry. Wu Dingchang, Zhou Yichun, representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Railways, and coal mine representatives, totaling about 50 people, attended. Chairman Wu Dingchang presided over the ceremony, followed by a detailed speech. He stated that China's coal reserves rank third in the world, and its coal industry developed earliest. Coal industry occupies an important position in China's various industries. Taking the provinces within the customs of this country as an example, the total investment in new and old coal mines has exceeded 150 million yuan, which is not a small amount. In 1929, the total coal production was 15 million tons, with a surplus of 1.2 million tons. Since the September 18th Incident, the coal produced in the provinces within the customs has not been sufficient to meet the needs. Therefore, foreign coal imports have consistently exceeded 1 million tons per year. In 1934, coal production increased to 20.9 million tons, with imports only 220,000 tons. Last year, coal production increased to more than 21 million tons, and exports exceeded imports by 100,200 tons. From this, it can be seen that the coal produced in the provinces within the customs can not only be self-sufficient, but also has a tendency to be excessive. All coal mines should be operated consistently, and they should consider how to allocate production and sales quantities internally to mutually benefit their businesses, and how to promote exports externally to partially recover the national economy. In recent years, major coal mines have complained about economic difficulties, increased costs, delayed transportation and sales, and dumping of foreign coal, and have requested relief. However, after detailed research, the issues related to transportation costs and taxes are merely trivial, while those related to sales competition are fundamental. Therefore, five joint sales methods for coal mines have been proposed to convene this conference for lengthy discussion. The Ministry does not intend to force the implementation of these five methods, but the Ministry deeply believes that these methods are the way to save the country and survive. It is hoped that the representatives will discuss this on their own to obtain an easy-to-implement plan to establish the foundation for national coal industry cooperation, which can also be used as a means of self-rescue. Wu also made a few additional explanations: "The coal companies convened this time are those with larger production volumes, which can represent two-thirds of the total coal production in the provinces within the customs. The coal produced by the remaining small mines mostly supplies local needs and does not affect the export market." "The coal companies convened this time are not limited to Chinese capital. All Chinese-foreign joint venture mines producing coal in the country are invited to participate to seek full cooperation." "The production and sales of anthracite and bituminous coal are different, and can be studied and handled separately." "The largest coal market for domestic sales is the five ports of Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Tianjin, and Beiping. It is planned to first establish these five regions as the basic locations for joint sales." After Wu's speech, Cheng Yifa, Director of the Mining Department, reported on the process of convening the conference and the annual coal sales situation in the five major ports of Shanghai, Hankou, Beiping, Tianjin, and Guangzhou in detail, to provide materials for research. In addition, many representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Railways and coal mine merchants rose to speak. The ceremony concluded at noon. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Coal Industry Conference held a general meeting at 3:00 PM on the 1st. Zhou Yichun chaired the meeting. The proposal for joint sales methods for coal mines proposed by the Ministry of Industry was approved in principle. It was found that the conference received more than ten proposals in total, among which the important ones also included the proposals submitted by the Mining Association of the Republic of China. The outline includes five items: Balance of production and sales volume; Balance of transportation volume and freight; Equality of mining tax; Equality of government-run and commercial-run enterprises; Tax reduction or exemption for export. All cases will be first submitted for review. The review committee is divided into two groups: bituminous coal and anthracite coal. The reviewers of each group were also announced by the chairman and passed by the general meeting. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. In the evening, Wu Dingchang hosted a banquet for all attendees at the Lizhi Society. The upper and lower afternoons of the 2nd will be review meetings, and the conference can be closed after the second general meeting on the morning of the 3rd. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The coal industry conference convened by the Ministry of Industry held an opening ceremony at 10:00 AM on the 1st. Chairman Wu Dingchang delivered a speech. The first meeting was held at 3:00 PM, chaired by Zhou Yichun, to discuss the joint sales methods for the coal industry proposed by the Ministry of Industry. The representatives expressed their opinions on five points: sales methods, allocation of sales volume, setting market prices, joint sales, saving competition costs, and subsidizing exports. After detailed research, the chairman decided to merge the proposals with those of the China Mining Association for research, first submitting them for review, and appointed committee members for Group A (bituminous coal) and Group B (anthracite coal). The review meeting was scheduled to be held on the upper and lower afternoons of the 2nd. (Special Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Wu Jingheng speaks on the necessity of unified training, and Chairman Lin reports on the memorial of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's burial.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 26th Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 1st. Vice Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, committee members Lin Sen, Qi Chucang, Wu Jingheng, Zhou Qigang, Fang Zhi, Zhang Lisheng, Ma Chaojun, Zhu Peide, Wen Yiduo, Li Zonghuang, Wang Yongbin, Gan Naiguang, and all staff, totaling about 700 people, attended. Wu Jingheng chaired the meeting and gave a report entitled "The Necessity of Unified Training for All Current Production Undertakings." He briefly stated that today, the most important thing is to have unified training plans in terms of morality and physical education. All training can be carried out using unified methods. This is truly a good trend with the hope of popularization. In my opinion, we should also immediately plan a unified training method in production. Otherwise, if the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, relief alone will ultimately be training without practice, with little effect. Practice without unification will also be difficult to popularize. At a time when economic depression and unemployment are rampant in society, if we can come up with a unified production training method, it will increase the number of people who work hard to produce and reduce the number of people who consume without producing. The ancients often regarded forced cultivation and weaving, and prohibition of idleness, as important government decrees, and it is not a special innovation. After Wu's speech, the ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week at 10:00 AM on the 1st.

<p>(Nanjing) At the Memorial Week held by the National Government on the morning of the 1st, Chairman Lin reported on "Commemorating Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Burial and National Survival." First, he stated that today, when we commemorate Dr. Sun Yat-sen's burial, we must earnestly follow his teachings, and first enable the nation to independently survive, and then we can seek national freedom and equality. The 3rd is also the Anti-Smoking Memorial Day. This is a memorial day related to the health of our nation. Whether the Chinese nation can survive depends on the success of our anti-smoking plan. Thinking of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions on rejecting drugs, we feel that the anti-smoking work cannot be relaxed in the slightest. Next, he said that the central government has had very strict plans for anti-smoking in recent years, and there are very strict laws for planting, selling, transporting, smoking and manufacturing, and a six-year ban on smoking and a two-year ban on drugs, using severe punishments to achieve the effect of avoiding evil. Since the strict ban, the number of smokers has gradually decreased. At the same time, we also hope that the people of the whole country will assist the government in reporting, and strive to eliminate opium and drugs within a certain period. Finally, he said that banning smoking and drugs is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's most strict instruction, and it is the basic work that must be followed first to realize the Three Principles of the People. I hope everyone will pay attention to it." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Hankou) Fan Xiji, accompanied by Xi Dejiong, Shi Yuling, and two technical officers from the Economic Commission, went to the fourth work section and the water interception and cutoff dam on the 20th to investigate the situation as follows: "The breach in the fourth work section is 550 meters long, with a maximum depth of 6 meters and a maximum flow rate of 1.5 meters per second." "There are two breaches in the cutoff dam, one is 238 meters long to 4.7 chi, with a flow rate of 1.508 meters, and the other is 155 meters long, with a depth of 2.5 meters to 3.3 meters and a flow rate of 1.037 meters." "There are a total of six breaches in section A of the water interception dam, some of which have been cut off and some of which are about to be cut off." "Currently, the breach in the fourth work section and the cutoff dam are being wrapped up. As for the breach process, the cutoff and water interception dams had been leaked through several holes before 8:00 AM on the 26th. At that time, the water level reached 45 meters. The breach occurred at 8:00 AM. The reason for the breach in the fourth work section was the surge in the drainage ditch. According to the report from the section chief, he supervised 10,000 workers to rush to build it in the morning of the 26th and raised it to 45 meters at 6:00 PM, but water leakage occurred at 9:40 PM and the rush to build was ineffective.

It is now planned to simultaneously recruit laborers to rush to block the water interception dam and the fourth work section. If one of the two can be completed, it can help the entire dike. If the water level is not high this year, it may be possible to complete it fortunately. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Ministry of Industry News: Marine product imports in the first year of the Republic were only 12,279,000 yuan, but by the 23rd year, they had increased to over 30 million yuan. Japan accounts for more than two-thirds, followed by Nanyang countries. Recently, fishing vessels from a certain country have sailed into our territorial waters to catch aquatic products. Although fishery protection agencies have been conducting strict patrols, prevention is difficult. Over a hundred fishing vessels invade our borders for fishing, almost as a routine occurrence. However, recently it has become even more severe, with approximately 150 vessels. The responsible authorities have instructed the relevant coastal agencies to find ways to investigate and prevent this. (1st Day Special Dispatch)</p>

The Second Battle Squadron is formed by retaining the battleships "Nagato" and "Fuso" from the First Fleet's First Battle Squadron, while the remaining "Haruna" and "Kirishima" are used.

<p>Tokyo: The government is establishing a fiscal plan based on a plan to strengthen national defense in compiling the next year's budget, hoping that the military will decide on this plan as soon as possible. Furthermore, since the content of the national defense strengthening plan is significantly related to fiscal and tax system reforms, the military's decision on the national defense plan is attracting attention from all sides. The Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters are currently researching the national defense plan and producing a concrete proposal, scheduled to hold a leadership meeting in mid-June to decide on the plan's outline. According to this plan, in view of international circumstances and the severe situation, the focus will be on enhancing the military equipment stationed in Manchuria, improving the second phase of air defense facilities, and preparing aviation materials, with the plan to be completed over the next three to four years. To implement this plan, the Army's national defense budget will increase by approximately 200 million yuan from next year. After this plan is decided, Army Minister Terauchi will submit it to Prime Minister Hirota and Finance Minister Baba for approval. (1st Day Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Army and Navy Ministries have already begun compiling the budget in accordance with the guidelines for compiling next year's budget decided at the cabinet meeting on the 29th. It is reported that the Army's expenses will be 700 million yuan, and the Navy's expenses will be 800 million yuan, with total military expenses reaching a huge sum of 1.5 billion yuan. This will have a significant impact on Finance Minister Baba's fiscal policy and the fate of the Hirota cabinet, which is quite evident. Finance Minister Baba intends to supplement the increase in national defense spending and other expenditures by increasing national taxes. However, the budgets requested by the Army and Navy are so large that even with the implementation of maximum tax increases, the prospects are extremely difficult. Therefore, the current cabinet is said to be on the brink of danger around October of this year. (1st Day Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>

This agreement stipulates that each country can directly buy and sell domestic products up to 100 million yuan per year. (1st Day Allied News)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The contents of the German-Manchukuo trade agreement were announced on the 1st in both Changchun and Berlin. The conclusion of this agreement will open a new chapter in the economic cooperation between Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany, which is worthy of attention. The German government, with the aim of investigating the possibility of the National Socialist German Party's expansion of trade in the Far East, organized an East Asian Economic Observation Group on October 30 of last year, dispatching Chief Representative Minister Plenipotentiary Kip, Dr. Gunor, and Dr. Nozempr, to negotiate with the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities on issues such as the adjustment of trade relations between Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany, and the economic improvement between Japan and Germany. As a result of the mediation of Matsushima, Director of the Commercial Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, both sides reached a consensus on the conclusion of the German-Manchukuo trade agreement. The officials in charge of Manchukuo and Germany formally signed the agreement in Tokyo on April 30. The trade relations between Germany and Manchukuo show that Manchukuo's exports to Germany reached 53 million yuan, while imports from Germany were 12 million yuan (all in 1934), a one-sided trade favorable to Manchukuo. As for the commercial relations between Japan and Germany, Japan's exports to Germany were 19 million yuan, while imports were 109 million yuan (last year), a one-sided trade unfavorable to Japan. With the conclusion of this agreement, a triangular trade relationship can be formed between Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany, which will surely have a great effect on the mutual adjustment of trade between the three countries. Furthermore, this agreement is a business agreement between the representative of the German Exchange Bureau and the representatives of the Manchukuo authorities. (1st Day Allied News)</p>

<p>Seeking Happiness for Labor Within the Scope of the Constitution, Upholding the Proposition of Disarmament and Peace</p>
<p>Paris: The National Congress of the Orthodox Socialist Party opened at the Huygens Stadium at 2:30 PM today. First, Representative Chilonski, a leader of the party's left wing, gave a speech, stating that the future government should be a government that strives to struggle, and that it should have close ties with the people. Representative Bivanl, a leader of the extreme left wing, followed with a speech, saying that the bourgeoisie is already feeling uneasy about the measures of the future cabinet, and the party should not comfort them in any way. "Instead, we should depress their spirits to speed up their collapse. We are now in the position of pioneers, and sooner or later we will lead all members of the party to move forward bravely without retreating. We have won political power after struggle, and if we want to keep it, we must take action urgently to lead the working class to achieve final victory. The future cabinet, exercising power under the bourgeois system, should aim to establish a completely socialist country, otherwise it will be meaningless." He also said that the term of compulsory military service should be reduced from two years to one year immediately, which was applauded by the audience.</p>
<p>After Bivanl finished speaking, Secretary-General Foor of the Socialist Party followed, declaring that the future cabinet should be a cabinet of the Popular Front and implement the political program of the Popular Front. (31st Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Then the party leader, the future Prime Minister Léon Blum, spoke, saying that after taking office as Prime Minister, he intended to strive to complete the established procedure. He was determined to seek order, happiness, security, and fairness for labor within the scope of today's constitution, and to achieve the victory of socialism. However, the new government would not become a Kerensky government, as claimed by the reactionary parties. Fascism is now trying to find opportunities to destroy labor organizations, which was met with enthusiastic cheers from the audience. Blum also predicted that capital would continue to flow out and that the people in the country would continue to hoard it. (31st Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Main Points of Léon Blum's Speech at the National Congress of the French Socialist Party <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Léon Blum, the leader of the Orthodox Socialist Party and the future Prime Minister, delivered a lengthy speech at the party's National Congress today. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Alleviating People's Suffering: Léon Blum mentioned the purpose of the future cabinet's administration, stating that "Is it possible to alleviate the people's suffering and comfort their expectations under the current system, given the frequent disasters? The establishment of a new political system is an inevitable fact. Our party has been suspending this goal and shouldering this responsibility for more than a day. However, is it possible to make sufficient preparations for the new political system in both the mental and material aspects of the people within the scope of the current system? Can we find a bridge of transition between the current society and the society we want to establish? All of these are what we want to know."</p>
<p>Foreign Sympathy: Léon Blum then described the impact of the victory of the left-wing Popular Front election on foreign countries, stating that "Our party's victory has been greatly comforted by the world, as evidenced by the expression of sympathy published by the Second International. We still remember that when the Second International recently held a meeting in Brussels, Belgium, all branches were greatly appreciated when they heard the news that the French left-wing Popular Front had been formed, and regarded it as a victory for freedom and democracy in Europe. When they heard the news of our party's election victory, they were even more pleased, believing that the hope for the future of the 'Labor International' of the world, and the key to its revival, is reliably guaranteed by this move. I dare say that those who harbor this hope are not only the branches of the Second International, but the hope harbored by all countries in Europe is even more profound."</p>
<p>Proposition of Peace: My French comrades are all loyal to their beliefs and do not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. If these people become the spokespersons of the government in the future and make a loud call from a high place, the whole of Europe will surely respond. Moreover, the peace that we advocate is fair and equal, complete and true, indivisible and effective. In a word, it is disarmament and peace. This proposition will surely be responded to. Since we are socialists of the Second International, we are more qualified than anyone else to uphold the meaning of peace, because we are loyal to our party and the Second International.</p>
<p>Establishing a New Political System: Our France used to have a glorious history that was recorded in historical books, but now it has reached an old age. The people of the country stick to old habits, which has become a deep-rooted problem. There is a lack of both will and consciousness for the future. A country is like a person. To encourage its vitality and revitalize its spirit, it must rely on the establishment of a new political system. Now, it is the general psychology of the vast majority of people to wait for the arrival of this new political system, not only our party, not only other proletarian political parties, not only the masses who voted for the Popular Front, but also all other people.</p>
<p>Executing Tasks: His conclusion said, "We should act in unison so that the promises we have made to the people can be implemented. Now we should have the courage and determination to live up to our mission. Then the victory of the Popular Front can be called the first sound of the victory of socialism."

<p>Sarraut Cabinet Prepares to Resign, Socialist Leader to Take Over and Form Cabinet</p>
<p>Paris: The Sixteenth Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic (elected in two rounds of voting on April 26 and May 3) is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 3 PM today. It will be presided over by Charles, the oldest member of the parliament, as the provisional speaker, and several of the youngest members will be the provisional vice-speakers. Today's meeting is only to hold the opening ceremony and to elect the speaker and other officials, which is usually held on Wednesday or Thursday. In addition, the Sarraut Cabinet is scheduled to submit its resignation on Tuesday evening. President Lebrun will then entrust Léon Blum, the leader of the Orthodox Socialist Party, to form a new cabinet. The candidates for the cabinet have all been internally determined. It is expected to be formally formed around Friday of this week. According to general speculation, the new Prime Minister Léon Blum intends to reduce the number of cabinet seats and increase the number of deputy ministers in each department. Among the three parties that make up the new cabinet (i.e., the Orthodox Socialist Party, the Independent Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party, as for the fourth party, i.e., the Communist Party, although it agreed to support the new cabinet, it refused to join the cabinet), three ministers without portfolio will be simply appointed. Léon Blum will serve as Prime Minister without concurrently serving as a minister. The current Minister of Justice Ta尔博斯 (Radical Socialist Party) will probably take over the post of Foreign Minister, and Representative Oliver (Orthodox Socialist Party) will be the Minister of Finance. Former Prime Minister Daladier, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, will be the Minister of the Army, and Mayor Salangro of Lille (Orthodox Socialist Party) will be the Minister of the Interior, Representative Gemb希 (a famous lawyer belonging to the Radical Socialist Party) will be the Minister of the Navy. After the establishment of the new cabinet, it will attend the Chamber of Deputies on Monday or Tuesday of next week. The new Prime Minister Léon Blum will read out the general policy, and the Chamber of Deputies will vote to trust it. At that time, the organization of the majority party in the government will be concretized. (1st Day Havas Dispatch)</p>

(1st Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The White Star Line's new ship "Queen Mary" encountered heavy fog en route yesterday, losing its chance to win the Atlantic speed title. It suddenly increased its speed at night under the moonlight, reaching 31 nautical miles per hour. It arrived at the quarantine station here at 10:09 AM this morning (New York time, which is 10:09 PM Shanghai time). If it had arrived at the 白羅斯 lighthouse three hours earlier, it would have captured the record held by the French ship "Normandy." According to unofficial sources, the ship took 101 hours and 53 minutes to travel from Priest Rock to the lighthouse, while the "Normandy" took 99 hours and 14 minutes, a difference of only two hours and 39 minutes. According to official announcements, the speed of the "Queen Mary" was 29.133, while the "Normandy" was 29.94. As soon as the "Queen Mary" dropped anchor, Professor Butler, the famous president of Columbia University, boarded the ship with many others. The British Consul General also boarded the ship to congratulate Captain Sir Bredan. According to a Reuters reporter's description of the scene when the ship arrived in port, the tops of New York's skyscrapers were crowded with spectators after breakfast, many of whom brought breakfast and watched while eating. The harbor was full of ships welcoming the "Queen Mary," making it difficult for the liner to enter the port. Former New York Mayor Whelan, representing the current Mayor LaGuardia, flew over the "Queen Mary" in an airplane when it passed the Ambrose Lighthouse, broadcasting New York City's welcoming remarks. In addition, there were airplanes and various ships to welcome it. Captain Bredan immediately gave a speech in response. When the "Queen Mary" was about to reach its destination, a declaration was posted in front of the smoking room, signed by 31 famous American passengers, congratulating Captain Bredan.

<p>Entire Territory Divided into Five Zones Under Governors</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the administrative organization of the new Ethiopian Empire, the government has recently drafted laws advocating the establishment of a governor-general stationed in Addis Ababa (i.e., the Ethiopian capital) as the highest administrative officer with full powers. Under him will be a deputy governor, a chief of staff, and two advisory bodies to assist the central government: a government committee and an advisory committee, both chaired by the governor-general, with participation from senior officials and local gentry. Except for the capital region, which is governed by the civil administrator of Addis Ababa, the entire territory is divided into five administrative zones: Eritrea, capital Asmara; Amhara (northwest), capital Gondar; Bal and Sidamo (southwest), capital Gimma; Harar (east), capital Harar; and Somalia, capital Mogadishu. Each zone will have an administrator with administrative autonomy but will be subject to the control of the Governor-General of Abyssinia. Religious affairs, laws, education, Arabic language, Islamic groups, and local customs will be allowed to continue and will be effectively protected. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>More than 60 Foreign Firms Smuggling, Inducing Chinese Merchants to Participate</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Smuggled goods from a certain country have been flooding into Shantou since June of last year, marking its first anniversary. Over the past year, the progress of foreign smuggling firms has been rapid, growing at an astonishing pace. There are an estimated 60 such firms, not including warehouses, branches, or agencies. The number of smuggling ronin has increased from 200-300 to over 600, not including those who come and go without registering their household. At least 15 million yuan has been lost in customs duties and various special taxes collected by the Guangdong Agricultural Tax Bureau. The losses that are difficult to calculate (such as the business losses and closures of legitimate merchants) are two to three times higher. Initially, the Japanese and Taiwanese foreign firms in Shantou each operated with their own funds, but competition arose and profits were meager. Therefore, the Japanese consulate mediated and arbitrated the establishment of a Japanese Association Company. Merchants wishing to handle goods can have the Association Company handle customs declarations, cargo pickup, and warehousing. In the event of disputes or the need for forceful seizure, the transportation group organized by the Association will dispatch Taiwanese to escort the goods into the interior. There is also a beating squad dedicated to dealing with our customs enforcement teams. The internal organization is said to be very strict. In Shantou, various goods, in addition to normal customs duties, are subject to special taxes, specific taxes, consolidated taxes, and other levies, which can be several times higher than the original price of the goods, such as sulfuric acid, kerosene, refined spirits, white sugar, explosives, or monopoly goods. Even the cheapest items, such as old newspapers and old rubber shoes, are taxed at two yuan per hundred catties. However, goods sold by ronin are not subject to these taxes, so their prices are very low. As a result, they have the potential to monopolize the market not only for oil, beans, rice, and other food items, but even for cloth, matches, seafood, and other goods, which are all falling into the hands of Japanese and Taiwanese. Legitimate Chinese and foreign shops in Chaoshan have been affected, with a quarter of them closing down due to their inability to compete. However, the ronin are not satisfied with this, so they have expanded the organization of their Association Company, extending their influence deep into the interior of Fujian and Guangdong. It is reported that the expanded capital is 1 million yuan, with each share costing 100 yuan. Japanese and Taiwanese ronin own half, and the remaining half is reserved for Chinese merchants who distribute the goods to buy shares. The Association settles accounts once a month, and each share of 100 yuan can yield a dividend of 80-90 yuan in the middle of the month. During the new share offering in May, Chinese merchants who distribute smuggled goods secretly invested over 200,000 yuan, all in the names of Japanese and Taiwanese, introduced by foreign firms, and given a receipt. The Association also plans to directly charter Japanese ships in the future to transport oil beans and bean cakes from Dalian and Andong, cement, alcohol, and white sugar from Taiwan, and rice from Siam, without going through intermediaries, directly to Shantou. From then on, the import of smuggled goods will inevitably become more prevalent.</p>
<h3 id="e98">League of Nations Administrative Council's Attitude Towards China's Request for a Council Seat <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Most Council Speakers Advocated Three Years for China and One Year for Portugal</p>
<p>Geneva Dispatch: The current session of the League of Nations Administrative Council has held three meetings. Although these meetings are of a routine nature, the situation has become increasingly serious due to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute. The Council's attention seems to be solely focused on that issue. Therefore, the first two meetings failed to bring it up for discussion. Furthermore, due to the Italian representative, Mr. Aloisi, the rapporteur of the Council, objecting to the inclusion of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute on the agenda, he angrily left the meeting and returned to his country. As a result, the report was not reviewed until the last meeting. The chairman, Eden, sought the Italian representative's opinion before he left. The Italian representative then expressed his agreement to the proposal to add two seats to the Council, but did not advocate for any resolution in the Administrative Council, leaving it to be resolved by the General Assembly in September. Therefore, the Administrative Council, apart from forwarding the report and the opinions of the participating representatives to the General Assembly, did not make any resolution. However, the Administrative Council's opinion can undoubtedly serve as a standard for the General Assembly to resolve the above issue. Moreover, according to the past situation of the League of Nations, any issue that can be passed in the Administrative Council will be accepted by the General Assembly. However, what remains to be resolved by the General Assembly is only the dispute of three years or one year, or the competition between China and Portugal for one year versus three years. In short, if China gets three years, then Portugal gets one year, and vice versa. Or both seats get only one year. Observing the speakers of the Administrative Council, they all sympathize with China getting three years and Portugal getting one year. For the sake of the League's justice and its universal cooperation, the Administrative Council should have this attitude. It is also the result of Guo Shi's two years of effort. We only hope that the representatives who spoke at this time will keep their promises and not make cunning attempts during the anonymous vote at the General Assembly in September. Moreover, the weakness of the League of Nations' strength has been widely seen by the world. Its prestige has been swept away, and the Covenant has become invalid, which is also generally acknowledged by public opinion. Under this circumstance, instead of attempting concrete improvements, it can only sit and wait for collapse. On our side, if we do not feel that the League of Nations is beneficial, then there is no value in participating. If we want to engage in diplomacy, we should take a proactive attitude. Therefore, we very much hope that Guo Shi will go one step further. Although we cannot hope to obtain a permanent seat on the Council, if we only obtain a one-year term with two years of effort, then we will have to compete again before the seat is even warm. It is inevitable that we will add another difficulty in a very short period of time. The reporter hereby respectfully recounts the opinions of the representatives who participated in the Administrative Council, for readers to refer to:</p>
<p>Chairman Eden said that the report of the Italian representative has been submitted to the Administrative Council. The report stated that the committee approved the addition of two seats, one for an Asian country and the other for a European country that does not belong to a bloc. The committee agreed to allow China to re-enter the Administrative Council in 1936. The rapporteur also proposed that this issue can only be resolved at the General Assembly and that the Administrative Council should not make a specific resolution.</p>
<p>The Portuguese representative, in addition to expressing his support for China's participation in the Administrative Council, said that according to the committee's proposal, Asia is equal to two seats (the reporter notes that this refers to Turkey being considered part of Asia). If one seat is given to a European country that does not belong to a bloc, then there will be a total of fourteen seats. The report seems to be inaccurate. Since the proposal is temporary in nature, then three years is inevitably too long.</p>
<p>The Turkish representative said that new council members should be given a three-year term, according to the usual practice of the Administrative Council. He also expressed his sympathy for China's re-entry into the Administrative Council.</p>
<p>The Romanian representative said that he had long hoped for China to join the Administrative Council to make up for the Administrative Council's lack of Asian representation. He felt very gratified that China could be given a seat. However, regarding the temporary seat for a European country that does not belong to a bloc, he advocated for a one-year limit.</p>
<p>The Soviet representative, Litvinov, said that the members of the Administrative Council had agreed to give China a temporary seat, and he was very satisfied. However, regarding the term of the temporary seat for a European country that does not belong to a bloc, it could only be stipulated as one year. Therefore, he proposed giving China three years and Portugal one year.</p>
<p>The Portuguese representative then further stated that he personally agreed in principle to China's three-year term, but that for this temporary measure, especially in light of the special circumstances, it could be stipulated as one year. The Portuguese representative's intention was not to give China three years while he only got one year. The Administrative Council passed the report and resolved to transfer it to the General Assembly along with the opinions of the members. At this point, an important chapter in the issue, which had undergone many twists and turns over the past two years, came to a close. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e100">Zhangzhou's 80th Division Resolves the Bandit Gang of Zhang Heshan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Zhang is a Notorious Bandit from Nanjing</p>
<p>Zhang's Wives, Concubines, Sons, and Daughters Were All Arrested. Although Zhang Escaped, the Entire Situation Has Been Resolved</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Zhang Heshan, a notorious bandit from Zhangzhou, had long been entrenched in Nanjing. When the 19th Route Army was defeated and abandoned Zhangzhou, Zhang was the first to enter the city under the name of the Fujian Southern Anti-Rebel Army, obtaining more than 500 rifles and more than ten machine guns that were left behind. Although the military authorities later recovered some of them, most of them were still kept by Zhang. Therefore, Zhang's strength was the strongest among the Zhangzhou militias. Last year, the Pacification Headquarters and the Provincial Government jointly reorganized the militias throughout the province. Zhang's unit was organized into a large detachment and incorporated into the 9th Security Regiment, which was transferred to Nan'an. However, Zhang only sent his confidant Zhang Yunhan with a part of the unit. He nominally led the unit from Nanjing. Nanjing still had Zhang's main force of more than 300 men and guns, entrenched in the mountain city of Guanxi Nankeng as their base. Nankeng was especially their lair. Later, the Security Office dismissed Zhang from his position as detachment commander because he had not reported for duty for a long time. Zhang, who had actual strength and possessed huge funds, meticulously managed and dominated Nanjing, and even extended to Pinghe. Finally, the Nanjing County Government reorganized them into the Nanjing County Security Squadron, with his son Zhang Dazhou as the squadron leader. The troops were entrenched in the Shancheng area and had not been transferred. Although the authorities gave them special consideration, Zhang imposed harsh taxes and levies, and the people could not bear it. Local bullies attached themselves to him, and his power became increasingly arrogant. Whenever government troops arrived, they would retreat and evade. When the government troops left, they would return. Recently, the authorities received numerous accusations, and, considering that Zhang was growing stronger and harboring ulterior motives, they decided to resolve the situation. Qian Dongliang, the brigade commander of the 239th Brigade of the 80th Division, announced martial law in Guanxi at 7 p.m. on the 23rd, and banqueted local gentry and all members of the district office, placing them all under surveillance on the spot. He immediately dispatched troops in three routes to surround Zhang's lair in Nankeng. He first sent a battalion to Haozailin Village and Louzaicuo Village, but failed to capture Lai Changshou, an important bandit in Zhang's unit, only capturing Lai's wife. Then they arrived at Xiaoshancheng and advanced towards Nankeng. Another route went towards Xiangxi, also attacking Nankeng. Another force of one battalion went from Guanxi to Cuiwei Market, disarming the entire squadron of Zhang's unit stationed there, killing eight people including the platoon leader, and arresting Zhang Dazhou and his two wives and concubines. That night, they traveled overnight to Shancheng. Zhang Heshan's wife was arrested in Guanxi. Arriving at Shancheng, his third concubine was arrested again. The third concubine was on the run. Zhang's plainclothes team in Gezhu Market was also resolved at the same time. In addition, troops were transferred from Zhangzhou to block the Caishe area behind Shancheng. The Caishe area was where Cai Zhensheng, the leader of Zhang's accomplice "Fu Zi Hui," had set up an altar. They also copied the rear route of Nankeng from Kuiyang, forming a four-sided encirclement. However, Zhang Heshan had also taken precautions in advance, deploying sentries for more than twenty li in Nankeng. For half a month, all travelers passing through Nankeng who were not recognized by the sentries were regarded as military scouts, shot, and buried, causing many unjust deaths. Nankeng is now under a four-sided siege. Zhang Heshan is trapped in the center of the encirclement. On the morning of May 24, the gentry under surveillance in Guanxi were released, leaving only Zhang Xiangrong and Zhang Tengwan, two of Zhang's henchmen, to be escorted to Shancheng. The prisoners who were disarmed in Cuiwei Market were also escorted to the brigade headquarters. In this operation, in addition to Zhang Heshan's two wives and concubines, his son Dazhou, and two daughters-in-law being arrested, Cai Lei, Zhang's Browning squad leader, and more than a hundred other bandits and local bullies who had joined the bandits were also arrested. Feng Dengyun, the president of the Shancheng Chamber of Commerce, and Liu Jinsheng, the former president of the Chamber of Commerce, were also among them and are currently in custody. Huang Yingxin and Cai Yun, two well-known local bullies who were secretaries of the Shancheng Chamber of Commerce, were reportedly killed. Feng Fanghui is on the run. All of these were Zhang's henchmen. As for Zhang Heshan himself, he heard the news in Nankeng on the night of the 23rd and hastily tried to gather his men to resist. However, his troops did not dare to act rashly because the large army had quickly arrived from Chanchang Xiaoshancheng. Seeing that the situation was gone, Zhang led the remnants of more than forty people, along with his second and fourth concubines and Cai Zhensheng, and fled to the nearby Hengtang bamboo forest. They then joined a group of remnants who had escaped from Zhuzizhen and fled to Changjiao Yongfu. When the troops arrived at Nankeng, they only captured one bandit. Later, they learned that Zhang had fled to the bamboo forest, so they surrounded and searched the bamboo forest but did not find him. Zhang Jichun, an important henchman of Zhang, was arrested. Zhang's unit can be said to have been completely resolved at this point. However, it is said that Zhang has hidden a large number of military weapons in places such as Daxiaoshancheng Nankeng Chanchang. (May 28)</p>
<h3 id="e101">Japanese and Korean Rogues Assault and Insult Customs Officers in Bengbu <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Demanding the Return of Confiscated Contraband Sugar</p>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Smuggling has become increasingly rampant recently. Large quantities of untaxed contraband goods are gradually being transported south. The main item being smuggled into Bengbu is sugar, which is all protected and peddled by Japanese and Korean rogues. As of the date of the establishment of the Bengbu Customs Anti-Smuggling Investigation Office on the Jinpu Railway, a total of 220 tons and 800 kilograms of sugar had been shipped from Tianjin to Bengbu, amounting to more than 4,000 bags, all stored at the freight station. Customs officers Cao Zhen, Li Jinggui, and Shao Changling, upon arriving in Bengbu, learned that the stored sugar only had freight bills but no tax bills. They immediately sealed up the contraband sugar and reported to the Customs Commissioner of the Maritime Customs, Mr. Merrell, for instructions. Subsequently, the Jinling Customs sent customs officer Zeng Xianlun to Bengbu to supervise the removal. The Customs also telegraphed the Ministry of Railways, requesting them to dispatch train cars for loading. The Ministry of Railways instructed the Jinpu Railway Bureau to comply. The Bengbu Railway Station, upon receiving the telegram from the Railway Bureau, immediately loaded all the more than 4,000 bags of contraband sugar onto train cars, which were escorted by customs officer Zeng to Shanghai at 1 a.m. on the 30th for customs processing. After this large quantity of contraband sugar was transported away, it was learned by Japanese and Korean rogues in Bengbu. At 2 p.m. today (31st), a group of five people (including three Japanese and two Koreans) were led by two locals (one Cantonese) to the freight station office of the Jinpu Railway Haxia Station to demand the return of the sugar from the station master, Wang Yanling. Wang told them that it had been transported away by customs officers. The rogues immediately requested Wang to invite the responsible customs officer to negotiate. Wang invited customs officer Shao Changling (from Tianjin) by telephone. Shao Changling, unaware that the rogues were at the freight station, accepted the invitation and went. Upon arriving and seeing the rogues, they exchanged only a few words before the Chinese and Korean rogues slapped and insulted Shao. They then punched him. Finally, the rogues raised a bench and attempted to strike Shao's head. At the time, there were seven rogues, their momentum fierce. Although they were assaulting a customs officer, no one dared to step forward to intervene. Shao, outnumbered, feared for his life and risked escaping, returning to the office to report. Cao Zhen, the director of the Anti-Smuggling Office on the Jinpu Railway in Bengbu, immediately telegraphed the Tianjin General Investigation Office to report to Director An Sier and requested the military and police authorities to provide adequate protection. At 4 p.m., the rogues returned to the freight station to demand the sugar. After Station Master Wang's vigorous explanation, the rogues left in a huff. Their arrogant behavior was infuriating. The rogues are still staying at the Jiaotong Villa. The people of Bengbu fear that these people will cause trouble and hope that the military and police authorities will severely crack down on them.

<p>The salaries of teachers in middle and primary schools in this county have always been paid monthly, without any delays. However, recently, only the salaries for February and March have been paid this semester. It is now two months overdue, and they especially hope to receive the salaries in advance before the summer vacation in June in order to make ends meet. Considering that teachers have a difficult life, how can they be allowed to be in arrears for so long? Therefore, Sun Zongkun, Tu Peiyu, Dou Yongren, Zhang Yun and other twelve people were elected as representatives to gather at the Education Bureau today and go to the County Government to petition. They were received by Secretary Shen, who promised to raise funds immediately. In addition to the salary for April, which has already been paid, he will do his best to raise the salaries for May and June. The representatives were satisfied and dispersed.</p>

<p>In order to improve the skills of automobile drivers and instill knowledge of repair, the Highway Administration of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction is holding an automobile driver training class.

<h3 id="e104">Telegram Requesting Change in Cocoon Price <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The spring silkworms in the four townships of this county have already spun their cocoons and are in good condition. The late batch is opening leaves after their major molt, but due to the shortage of mulberry leaves, demand exceeds supply, causing market prices to soar to more than four yuan per dan. Poor farmers who cannot afford to buy leaves have already abandoned their silkworms in the fields. Tang Puan and others, representatives of the cocoon industry in this county, considering this situation, have proposed that the cocoon price for this season should be determined by the Cocoon Association in accordance with the regulations of the National Economic Commission's Sericulture Improvement Association, with a maximum price of 30 yuan per dan. However, the cost of raising silkworms is significant. If the price of mulberry leaves is calculated at two yuan per dan, and the cocoon yield is calculated at a maximum of 45 jin per silkworm egg card, with each silkworm egg card consuming 900 jin of leaves, then the cost for a silkworm farmer to produce one dan of cocoons is about 50 yuan. Moreover, the leaf price for this season is as high as three to four yuan. At this cocoon price, each silkworm farmer will lose about 20 yuan for every dan of cocoons produced. Farmers will inevitably accumulate debt. The strong will take risks, and the weak will commit suicide in despair. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the National Economic Committee's Sericulture Improvement Association, requesting a change in the price of spring cocoons in order to maintain the livelihoods of farmers. In addition, there are a total of 263 cocoon businesses in this county. Currently, 203 businesses have reported to the Sericulture Model Zone, with 2,690 cocoon stoves.</p>

<p>Xiong Zhugao, the Director of the Education Bureau, ordered elementary school students from Cheng Han and Fu Yan schools to skip classes to move public and private property for the relocation of the bureau's office in January of this year, and damaged Ying'an Granary buildings and trees. Zhu Shenshan and other parents of the students filed a complaint with the Provincial Supervisory Envoy Office. Zhu Chunli, a commissioner appointed by the office, investigated and confirmed the facts. Ding, the supervising censor, submitted an impeachment to the Supervisory Yuan. The Supervisory Yuan committee members, including Neng Yuxi, reviewed the case according to law and deemed that it should be transferred for disciplinary action. Yuan Chang Yu Youren consulted the Judicial Yuan to instruct the Jiangsu Local Civil Servants Disciplinary Committee to handle the matter according to law. After receiving the order, the committee ordered the Education Bureau to submit a defense within fifteen days before proceeding with the matter.</p>

<p>Xu Changfu, a squad leader of the fourth platoon of the fifth team of the Provincial Security Team stationed in the county, rented a bicycle from Longfei Bicycle Shop in Guanjia Bridge in the city on the afternoon of the 31st. After four hours, he returned it and only paid one jiao for the rental fee. Fan Qinghuai, the owner of the bicycle shop, found that two screws on the bicycle were damaged and demanded compensation and the remaining rental fee, which led to a conflict. A police officer from the Guanqiao Patrol Station went to mediate. Wang Binwu, another officer from the Public Security Team, saw this and believed that the officer was protecting the bicycle shop owner. He returned to the team to report and gathered a crowd to block the street and beat up police officers Zheng Yuemin and Wu Xunshan, as well as health officer Sun Hanying. Zheng and Wu were thrown into the river from the bridge. Fortunately, they were rescued. Sun was stabbed several times in the head, and blood flowed everywhere. His life is in danger. The situation was serious for a while, and residents closed their doors. The situation was stopped after intervention from middle-ranking officers from both sides.</p>

<h3 id="e112">American Chamber of Commerce Cables Washington <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Please Broadcast the Harm Caused by Smuggling in North China</p>
<p>The "Great American Evening Post" reports that the American Chamber of Commerce in this city has cabled Washington, urging a nationwide broadcast of the rampant smuggling in North China, which is causing significant losses to the Chinese government and foreign investors. It is widely believed that this cable will have the same effect as the cable sent by the British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai to London, namely, that newspapers will vigorously criticize it. Although the American Chamber of Commerce's cable did not explicitly accuse the Japanese authorities of encouraging smuggling, it did ask for attention to be paid to the actions of the Japanese and the Japanese government's refusal to curb this practice. It is estimated that the loss of customs duties in Tianjin and Qinhuangdao in April reached 8 million yuan. If no measures are taken to enable the anti-smuggling teams to fulfill their duties, the losses will continue to increase. The cable also stated that foreign debts are also severely affected, and the influx of smuggled goods is greatly damaging China's entire legitimate trade. The cable was sent by Mr. Howe via the Chinese Wireless Telegraph Administration last Saturday (May 30th). A portion of the cable read: "Japanese smuggling in North China has increased to an enormous amount. The situation greatly hinders foreign loans and obligations secured by customs duties. Please broadcast the dangers to Chinese finance and commerce, as well as the fact that the Japanese government authorities are not taking measures to stop smuggling and are clearly unwilling to do so."</p>

<p>Discussing Relief for Qingdao's Industry and Commerce; Song Ziwen and Others Express Support</p>
<p>Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie, accompanied by Finance Bureau Chief Guo Bingsu, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 31st. A Central News Agency reporter visited and asked about the purpose of this trip. According to Shen, Qingdao's industry and commerce are depressed, and the economy is depleted. In order to seek relief, he came to Shanghai to meet with the Shanghai financial community to discuss loan relief and other measures. He has already met with Mr. Song Ziwen, Tang Shoumin, and other gentlemen, who have all expressed their support. Regarding providing relief to industry and commerce through loans, the banking community can obtain safe investments on the one hand, and industry and commerce can develop as a result on the other, which is a win-win situation. The specific measures will be discussed further by the Qingdao branch. Regarding smuggling in North China, Qingdao is also affected. Statistics show that in March and April, the number of ships decreased, resulting in a loss of 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in wharf fees and 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in customs duties. As a result, legitimate merchants are experiencing business decline, and relief measures must be taken. He is scheduled to return to Qingdao by China Aviation Corporation plane on the 2nd. In addition, Bank of China Chairman Song Ziwen hosted a luncheon for Mr. Shen at the International Hotel on the 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e117">Hu Xiyuan Suggests Promulgating the Industrial Association Law <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>A Letter Requesting Industrial Groups to Forward to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>Newspaper Agency reports that Hu Xiyuan, general manager of the China Yaboer Electrical Appliance Factory, believes that the government has regulations for chambers of commerce, trade unions, agricultural associations, etc., allowing them to organize according to law. However, the Industrial Association Law, which is valued in modern countries, is still lacking. Yesterday, he sent letters to the Shanghai Chinese Industrial Federation, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, and other industrial groups, requesting them to convene a meeting to forward the matter to the Legislative Yuan to promulgate the Industrial Association Law for compliance. The original letter is as follows: "Dear Sirs, China has been an agricultural country since ancient times, so farmers account for 70-80% of the national population. Since the opening of ports, industrial products have mostly come from abroad. At that time, the so-called 'industry' in the country referred specifically to artisans engaged in handicrafts, and there was no concept of industry as such. In recent centuries, coastal areas have been opened as commercial ports, and industry has flourished, and commerce has also become increasingly prosperous. Insightful people, aware that the lack of organization in various industries was insufficient to resist foreign aggression, established the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. After the establishment of the National Government, various laws and regulations were promulgated to maintain it. Thus, there is a Trade Union Law for workers, an Agricultural Association Law for farmers, and a Chamber of Commerce Law for those engaged in sales and profits, but there are no regulations for an Industrial Association Law for those who manufacture industrial products. Taking Shanghai as an example, the organizations that manufacture industrial products include the Yarn Industry Association, the Flour Industry Association, the Match Industry Association, the Electrical Appliance Manufacturing Industry Association, etc., which are either independent in nature or join the Chamber of Commerce, but there is no legally stipulated industrial group that can be required to join. The positions of industry and commerce are different, and their interests vary. There are many past examples, too numerous to list. For example, if industry is forced to be incorporated into a commercial group, not only will the name be inconsistent, but it will also be insufficient to exert the power of the group. In Japan, there are industrial associations for industry, commercial associations for commerce, and transportation associations for the transportation industry, which lies between industry and commerce. The categories are clearly defined, and the efficiency of the groups can be fully exerted. It is no wonder that the development of its industry and commerce has shocked the world. In recent years, industry in China has flourished everywhere, and the government's promotion and encouragement have been unwavering. The future prospects are immeasurable. If there is no legally stipulated industrial group to accommodate manufacturers of industrial products, the national industrial sector will inevitably be scattered, which will be an obstacle to industrial progress. Xiyuan believes that the strict organization of the industrial sector is a matter of utmost urgency, and the formulation of laws and regulations for industrial groups is particularly pressing. However, I do not have time to study the details and procedures of industrial organization, so I cannot list them for your consideration. Your association is an industrial group, and I wonder if it is possible to invite experts to discuss and submit a proposal to the Legislative Yuan to formulate an Industrial Association Law for the organization of industrial groups, just like the Chambers of Commerce, Agricultural Associations, and Trade Unions in various provinces and cities, and regulate it by law. I humbly offer my suggestions, and I hope you will consider and decide on them with anticipation."</p>
<h3 id="e118">34 Silk Factories in This City Resumed Operations Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Six More Factories Expected to Resume Operations in About a Week; Trade Union Approved to Handle Silk Worker Registration</p>
<p>New Public Opinion reports that the local spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have all entered the market. A total of 38 silk factories are registered in this city. Those that have resumed operations yesterday include: Gongda in the Zhabei District, Dayangqiao (72 reeling machines), Hongchang (72 reeling machines), Huashun (158 reeling machines), Fengtai (416 reeling machines), Fuchang (416 reeling machines), Yufeng in Gujiawan (226 reeling machines), Hengtai (240 reeling machines), Xinglun (180 reeling machines), Yufeng on Yingpan Road (238 reeling machines), Dasheng in Tanjiaqiao (208 reeling machines), Yingfeng (240 reeling machines), Yutai in Tanziwan (200 reeling machines), Hengcang in Miaotou (200 reeling machines), Jiufeng in Yanjia Pavilion (200 reeling machines), Yuanxing on Hutai Road (208 reeling machines), Yuanji (208 reeling machines), Fuchang in Meiyuan Road, Xinzha District (240 reeling machines), Dacheng in Yutong Road (240 reeling machines), Meifeng Xieji (240 reeling machines), Baisi on Guangfu Road (208 reeling machines), Dongxiang on Chang'an Road (208 reeling machines), Jiyu on Gonghe Road (208 reeling machines), Xinchang and Yihe in the concession area (416 reeling machines), China, Changji, Xiangcheng, Shenghuo, Tongyu, Zhongxing, Qiaoyuan, Zhicheng, and Fulun (double palace) in the Hongkou District (approximately 1,800 reeling machines), Baotai and Guangyuan in the South Shanghai District (420 reeling machines). As of yesterday, a total of 34 silk factories have resumed operations, with a total of 6,852 reeling machines.</p>
<p>Six More Factories to Resume Operations in About a Week</p>
<p>Six more factories, including Tailai and Jiushun on Chang'an Road, Xinzha District, Baokang on Hengfeng Road, Hengfeng on Guangfu Road, and Lixing on Tiantong Road, Hongkou, have not yet resumed operations due to incomplete factory building and machinery arrangements. It is expected that they will resume operations in about a week. If all the silk factories in this city resume operations, there will be a total of 40 factories, an increase of seven compared to last year. However, according to silk merchants, it takes five and a half piculs of local cocoons to reel one picul of silk. The cost of each picul of dry cocoons is 100 yuan, totaling 550 yuan. Adding labor and all other expenses, each picul costs about 130 yuan, totaling 680 yuan. Deducting the by-products, which can be sold for 80 yuan per picul, it is still a loss compared to the current overseas silk price of 600 yuan. Fortunately, the factories have already sold off their stock, so they can maintain expenses, but there is no profit to be made.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Party Headquarters Approves Silk Worker Registration <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Six Districts Silk Reeling Industry Union has over 10,000 silk reeling workers. In the past, due to the depression in the silk industry, many were unemployed. Now that the silk factories are resuming operations one after another, in order to stabilize the livelihoods of silk workers and compile statistics on workers' lives, a silk worker registration is being organized. A request was submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters for approval. Yesterday, the Municipal Party Headquarters issued a reply stating, "The submission for holding worker registration, requesting review and instructions to the Silk Factory Trade Association to notify the factories to cooperate, has been noted. The Silk Factory Trade Association is ordered to comply, and a letter is sent to the Public Security Bureau to instruct the relevant branch offices to assist as appropriate. You should be informed of this reply."</p>
<p>Ministry of Industry Plans to Establish a Tung Oil Refining Factory in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry, considering that the international market has a high demand for tung oil, and that general investors often take the opportunity to raise oil prices and arbitrarily manipulate the market, and that the production methods are outdated, resulting in impure oil that must be re-refined by foreign merchants before being exported, making it easy for others to monopolize, has planned to jointly establish factories in the five tung oil producing provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi, in order to improve production, manufacturing, and sales, and establish international credibility. The budget is set at 2 million yuan, with each of the five provinces of Zhejiang, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, and Guangxi contributing 300,000 yuan, totaling 1.5 million yuan, and the Ministry of Industry allocating 500,000 yuan to purchase new-style machinery to establish a large-scale oil refining factory in Shanghai. In the future, all domestically produced tung oil must be refined by the factory, and efforts will be made to control transportation and sales, so that the quality of tung oil is pure and the market price is uniform, facilitating foreign purchases. The plan is currently in active progress, and once the funds are raised, a shareholders' meeting will be held to discuss the details, survey the factory site, and begin construction of the factory buildings.</p>

<h3 id="e129">Hu Mengjia Suffers from Anemia <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Mengjia, Director of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank, suffered from anemia this spring. At first, he tried to persevere, but eventually he could not sustain his strength and sought medical treatment. After four months, he did not recover. On May 22nd, he moved into the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment, staying in room 17 on the fifth floor. After being examined with X-rays, no other symptoms were found. However, his anemia symptoms worsened, so a blood transfusion was performed on the 25th, totaling 40 cc, supplied by Hu's second daughter. However, on the 27th, his body temperature suddenly rose to 40.7 degrees, so a second blood transfusion was performed, totaling 250 cc, and 250 cc of a special saline solution was injected. Unexpectedly, on the 28th, his pulse rate reached only 55 beats per minute, so 5 cc of a cardiotonic was injected, and he gradually improved. By the 29th, he suffered from urinary incontinence and his body temperature reached 40.8 degrees.

<p>Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association Has Cabled for Release</p>
<p>The purchase of local spring cocoons by silk merchants from silk factories in Haining, Chongde, and other places in Zhejiang is nearing completion. The purchase of improved spring cocoons has also begun. Silk factories in Shanghai, such as Yihe, Xiangcheng, Jiyu, Xinchang, Changji, and Huasheng, were originally scheduled to start work yesterday. However, the spring cocoons obtained by the factories in various places in Zhejiang Province were detained by the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee, making it impossible to start work. A Newspaper Agency reporter inquired at various silk factories yesterday and heard that the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee detained the cocoons of the silk factories because the purchase prices were lower than the standard. It is also heard that the Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association has cabled Zhejiang Province for release, because the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee stipulates the standard price of spring cocoons as 21 yuan for local cocoons and 30 yuan for improved cocoons. The factories, considering the declining prices in the European and American markets for Chinese silk, slightly reduced the price of cocoons, resulting in the detention.</p>

<p>The Second Shanghai Municipal Yearbook Will Soon Be Published; Many Ancient Sites and Documents of This City Have Been Repeatedly Searched and Discovered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Gazetteer Office is simultaneously advancing its three tasks of investigation, research, and compilation of historical facts of various departments in this city, without interruption. This year's Shanghai Municipal Yearbook was completely compiled in May, with more refined content, one-third more than last year's municipal yearbook, totaling about three million words. This year, the Municipal Yearbook is being printed and distributed by the Chung Hwa Book Company and is expected to be published in early August. The usefulness of the Municipal Yearbook for various circles is self-evident. The drafts of the Municipal Gazetteer have also been compiled and, after final review, will be printed. The number of people requesting information from the office is increasing daily, from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Land Commission, Party History Compilation Committee, Municipal Council, New Life Inspection Group, to the China Credit Information Service, the Mainland Newspaper, the Far East Magazine, bookstore graduates, lawyers, and international organizations such as the Toa Dobun Shoin and the East Asia Economic Research Institute. The office has satisfied all those seeking materials. As for the office's investigation work, it is even more thorough. Before starting any investigation, ample preparations are made, so the results are very satisfactory, and many are discoveries and attention that people at the time had not made. For example, the office's investigation of ancient sites such as Yangjinglu Cemetery, Beimiao Mingxin Temple, and Longhua Temple has yielded stone tablets, relics, and other documentary materials that have long been widely publicized throughout the city. The four large Lu Shen's Maxims Stone Tablets in the Lujia Hong Guoyu Tang were also transferred to the Shanghai Municipal Museum for preservation after the office consulted with Lu's descendants. According to the office's recent investigation of ancient sites in the Fahua district, the Song Dynasty stele "Yun Han Zhao Hui Pavilion" in Jing'an Temple still exists, but the middle part is broken. There are also stone carvings of the Fahua Sutra, handwritten by Dong Qichang of the Ming Dynasty, and stone carvings of the Diamond Sutra, handwritten by Qiao Yiqi of the Ming Dynasty, which are still preserved in the Guanyin Chan Temple on Anhe Temple Road. In addition to rubbings, the office has also asked the municipal government authorities to pay attention to their preservation.</p>

<p>Reject Labor's Demand for Wages During Strike</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the workers of more than 100 foundry factories in this city went on strike once on the 27th of last month to demand that the employers reduce working hours. After the instructions from Party organs, the current working hours were maintained. However, the workers demanded that wages be paid as usual during the strike period, so it has not been resolved. All the workers' wages for last month have been delayed by the factories. The employers believe that prolonged delays are not a good solution, so they convened a general meeting at Sijing Road yesterday at 2 p.m. to discuss solutions. As a result, an industry association preparatory committee was established, and Fan Guo'an was elected as the director of the preparatory committee to reject the labor's demands.</p>

<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association of Renji Road has been handling relief affairs in northern Jiangsu and Shandong provinces since spring. In addition to the active progress made by local branches in a timely manner, special commissioners were dispatched to conduct on-the-spot inspections. The details of their extensive surveys have been reported in previous newspapers. The special commissioner of the association has now arrived in Jining, Shandong. According to reports, the emergency relief work has been completed. The inspections focused on dike repair and relief work. It was witnessed that the disaster victims were working very hard. Since it is close to the wheat harvest season, it will also be completed in one week. All post-disaster bridge repairs and road repairs, and other small parts are also employing disaster victims to replace relief with work, and rice, noodles, firewood, and other items are issued on time. Each person receives a minimum of 20 cents a day, which can still subsidize the livelihood of their families, women, and children.

<p>Huaxin Grounded: The Huaxin, a ship owned by the Shanghai Huaxin Shipping Company, with a deadweight of 1,918 tons, a length of 239 feet, a width of 33 feet 5 inches, and a draft of 17 feet 6 inches, is currently transporting salt in Haizhou. It was decided to load enough edible salt to capacity and sail to Yuezhou, which is above Hankou. Because the water level has been rising recently and the shallow beaches on both sides are submerged, navigation is more difficult. Due to the Jiang pilot's negligence, it ran aground. The Huaxin has a deep draft and is heavily loaded. After grounding, it was impossible to get it off. The shipowner sent a telegram to Shanghai yesterday. If it cannot be dislodged during high tide, the only option is to dispatch a ship to unload the cargo before attempting a rescue.</p>
<p>Longshan Out of Danger: The Longshan, a ship owned by the Shi Yi Bei Company, with a capacity of 2,278 tons, a length of 299 feet 6 inches, a width of 40 feet 9 inches, a depth of 19 feet 4 inches, and a draft of 17 feet, decided to sail to Qingdao and ran aground en route.

<p>All Stores Should Have Standard No. 6 Flags</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various industry associations to promote the unified Party and National Flag: To the esteemed associations, we received a letter from the Municipal Party and National Flag Unification Promotion Committee on May 25, stating that the Party and National Flag are symbols representing the Party and the nation. Citizens must respect the Party and the nation and must respect the Party and National Flag. On national celebrations and memorial days, the national flag must be displayed to show celebration and commemoration. This is a common practice in all countries, but the citizens of our country lack recognition of the national flag, and the flags made by the people are inconsistent, which is unsightly and detrimental to national dignity, and is of great importance. The central government, in view of this, issued a clear order to unify the Party and National Flag. The party and government agencies and organizations in this city, in compliance with the central government's order, in order to rectify the city appearance and awaken the national spirit, have organized this association. Since its establishment, the association has discussed the implementation methods several times, believing that universal implementation requires door-to-door promotion, and that significant results require the assistance of agencies and organizations. It was decided that in addition to sending propagandists from this association to promote the implementation in various streets, various agencies and organizations should be notified to prepare and use the unified Party and National Flag together. Therefore, we hereby request your association to forward this letter to various industry associations, instructing all members to prepare and use the unified Party and National Flag together, in order to rectify the city appearance, awaken the national spirit, and revive the future. The association also sent the unified implementation methods to the meeting on the same day. The methods stated that the standard flag for stores is No. 6. The implementation methods are that each district will have several promotion committee members who will, together with the police station's public security bureau, persuade door-to-door, starting with the prosperous streets. It is hoped that your association will prepare the standard No. 6 flags and send promotion staff to correct the flags of the affiliated industries. If there are any flags that do not meet the standard, persuade them to replace them immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Former Clerk of the High Court, Zhu Xiongwu's Case Trial Opened Yesterday: Accused of Embezzlement and Fraud in Eight Instances, Zhu's Voice Was Hoarse, Claiming to Be Due to Excessive Stimulation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>—All Three Defendants Detained for Further Questioning in Fifteen Days—</p>
<p>Zhu Xiongwu, former clerk of the Jiangsu High Court, also known as Yi Fu, during his tenure, colluded with his colleague Chen Chaozuan as his confidant and formed a private clique with his close friend Lu Wenguang. They worked together to repeatedly defraud litigants and extort money. After being dismissed by the Ministry of Justice last winter, he still lingered in the High Court, engaging in scams under false pretenses. Upon discovery, Zhu and others were arrested by name. After the investigation was completed, a public prosecution was filed against Zhu, Chen, Lu, and three others, including Chen's wife, Li Saiying, and bailiff Xu Jiaoben, for embezzlement and fraud. After a ruling by the Supreme Court, the part concerning Zhu Xiongwu was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai First Special District District Court. For the sake of procedural convenience, the original Wu County District Court handed over the remaining defendants to the First Special Court for consolidated handling. The case files have already been</p>
<p>sent to Shanghai, and they were separately detained. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng opened the court and ordered that the three defendants, Zhu, Chen, and Lu, be brought forward for questioning. The indictment against Zhu and others contained as many as eight charges, including: In the 23rd year, Wang Maishi, the wife of Wang Bingquan, appealed to the Jiangsu High Court in Qingpu due to an opium case. Lu Wenguang used the pretext of handling the case to defraud money from Wang. In April of the 24th year, Li Shannan committed a fraud case in Shanghai and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. Lu Wenguang took charge of handling the case, but Li was still sentenced to imprisonment, resulting in the fixed amount not being paid by Li. In May of the 24th year, when the Jiangsu High Court accepted a case involving the Zai family, Zhu Xiongwu had already taken leave to return to his hometown, but he took the opportunity to defraud the parties involved by writing letters to Chen Chaozuan to inquire about the date of case assignment and the progress of procedures. Chen Chaozuan would then reply to Zhu Xiongwu,</p>
<p>leaking information. Last September, when the Jiangsu High Court accepted a retrial case involving Chen Yuzhang, Chen Tingzhang, and Chen Zhaochu in Shanghai due to inheritance, Zhu, on behalf of the plaintiff in the retrial, inquired with the handling clerk Ma Runde about the date of case assignment and secretly read the registers to investigate the progress of procedures, with the intention of defrauding money. Last month, when Shanghai Yu Tai Company and Wuxi Zou Chengtai Rice Mill had a debt dispute, Jiang Hongbin, the representative of Yu Tai, invited lawyers Xu Hongchang, Li Yunqing, Yang Shaoyun, and Zhou Jiapu, as well as Zou Jikang, Zou Songfan, Shao Fucheng, Jiang Dongfu, and Zhou Zhaolin, representing Zou Chengtai, to mediate at the Ji residence in Wuxi. Zhu Xiongwu was also introduced to the scene to help Jiang Hongbin,</p>
<p>planning everything. They dispersed only the following morning. Subsequently, Yu Tai Company applied to the Wuxi Court to register the six thousand yuan mortgage note obtained during the mediation, but it was rejected due to incomplete procedures. Fearing that the creditor's rights would be unsecured, Jiang filed a lawsuit with the court. Zhu then falsely claimed to be able to influence the handling judge, Chen Shitao, and extorted a large sum of money. In the Weng Jun case, Zhu Xiongwu used the results of the fraud to suppress the case for a long time. In the Zhu Xinfu case, Zhu instructed Lu Wenguang to contact the parties involved in the case, promising to pay after the conclusion of the case. Last December, Miao Wenye and Sheng Jiu appealed to the High Court against the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor for obstructing the national currency. Miao and others hired lawyer He Qi as their defense counsel. Zhu and He were fellow townsmen, and at He's request, Zhu lobbied the High Court. In January of this year, he went to Shanghai to meet with Miao and Ye, claiming that he could influence the case to be handled by the second criminal division,</p>
<p>defrauding money. As for Xu Jiaoben, it was discovered during a court-ordered search of Lu Wenguang's home that he had accepted bribes in the Zhang Xingyuan red pill case in April of the 23rd year. Li Saiying was also jointly prosecuted because she hid all the evidence of her husband Chen Chaozuan's dealings with Zhu after Zhu Xiongwu was arrested. The prosecutor then appeared in court to briefly describe the transfer of jurisdiction after the filing of the case, requesting an investigation in accordance with the law. Judge Huang then questioned Zhu and others about their age, origin, and occupation. According to Zhu, he was 44 years old, from Qianwu, and formerly served as a clerk in the Wu County District Court, then transferred to the Zhenjiang Court. In January of the 18th year, he was transferred from Zhenjiang to the Jiangsu High Court, until October 30th of last year, when he received a</p>
<p>department order of dismissal. On November 22nd, he left the court after handing over his duties. Chen stated that he was 36 years old, from Pujiang, and was transferred from the Wu County District Court as a clerk to the Jiangsu High Court in the 20th year. Last year, he was transferred to the Qingjiangpu High Court First Branch Court as an interrogator. Lu stated that he was 37 years old, originally from Tianjin, residing in Suzhou, serving as a lawyer's clerk, etc. Zhu's voice was hoarse and difficult to hear. When asked about the reason, he claimed that he had been deeply stimulated since the case occurred, resulting in his hoarseness. However, he did not admit to any of the accusations. Even when the court presented letters between Zhu and Chen, he claimed that he could not remember what was said in the letters due to the passage of time. Regarding the fourth charge, he even argued that it was a false accusation by the acting clerk Ma Derun under the orders of Zhu Shusheng, the president of the Jiangsu High Court. Chen and Lu also offered excuses and denied the charges. Judge Huang stated that he still needed to investigate and summon witnesses, and rescheduled the hearing for 2:00 PM on June 15th. The three defendants, Zhu, Chen, and Lu, were still sent to jail for detention.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Fish Market's Business Last Month Reached Over 800,000 Yuan <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>The Fish Guild Non-Cooperation Case Remains Unresolved, Yu Qiaqing and Others Will Meet Today to Discuss</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has been open for two decades and business transactions have shown considerable improvement. According to statistics from the market, from the opening on the 12th of last month to the end of last month (31st), the total transaction of seafood and freshwater fish in the market reached 855,737 yuan, one jiao, and three fen. Seafood accounted for 686,316 yuan, six jiao, and nine fen, while freshwater fish accounted for 169,420 yuan, zero jiao, and four fen. Among the business operations in the previous month, the 28th was the best, with a total transaction of seafood and freshwater fish reaching 87,658 yuan, seven jiao, and eight fen. The transaction on the first day was the lowest, with a total transaction of seafood and freshwater fish reaching only 9,373 yuan, because preparations were just beginning at that time and transactions could not be concentrated. As for yesterday's business, it also reached slightly less than 50,000 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Organizing Lending: Regarding the lending to fishermen to provide relief, the Ministry of Industry has already formed a fishing industry syndicate with Shanghai banking circles, investing a total of one million yuan to engage in lending, which will only be realized at the beginning of July. During this period, the general fish shops and fishermen are at a time when the old and new are not yet connected, so the fish market will first lend small amounts of fishing industry funds. Yesterday, it was learned that this lending has already begun, and a total of 10,000 yuan has been released, it is said.</p>
<p>Welcome Cooperation: The thirteen fish shops in Xiaodongmen are still expressing their non-cooperation with the fish market due to disputes over lending, commission, and guarantee money, and have proposed three conditions: 1. No guarantee money will be paid when joining as a broker. 2. A branch market should be established in Xiaodongmen. 3. Loans previously issued by fish shops should be allowed to be recovered by themselves. According to fish market news yesterday, the market still welcomes all opposing fish shops to abandon their opinions and join in cooperation, and will reserve broker quotas, quietly waiting for all fish shops to join unconditionally, it is said.</p>
<p>Yu and Others Confer: Although the fish shops in Xiaodongmen that oppose the market have now opened for business, there are still many obstacles to joining the market. Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Shenzhi, Fang Jiaobo, Dong Yanfang, Jin Tingsun, and others, who are closely related to the fish shops, are scheduled to meet again at the Ningbo Fellow Association this afternoon to persuade the fish shops to join, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Rickshaw Association to Hold Meeting to Address the Problem of Converting Wheels <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Circular to Members to Solicit Opinions First, Injecting Preventive Vaccination and Setting up Tea Buckets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association, in response to the Public Concession's decision to implement the conversion of rickshaw wheels on July 1st of this year, found the matter to be urgent. Given the current economic downturn and the great impact on the interests of the industry, a special emergency meeting was convened yesterday at the association's headquarters at No. 4 Yongji Lane, Liangzang Road, to discuss countermeasures. Over thirty directors, including Shen Yong, Zou Shisong, Cheng Zhongdao, and Gao Youyu, attended. The meeting was chaired by Shen Yong, and after the formalities were completed, the discussion began. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>(A) Regarding how to respond to the conversion of wheels, it was resolved that: 1. Members will be notified immediately to solicit opinions. 2. Before this matter is resolved, all members must not arbitrarily change the wheels. (B) Considering the impending summer heat, it was resolved to actively carry out sanitation work: 1. Replenish various summer medicines for the free clinic. 2. Send a letter to the municipal health authorities requesting members to be injected with preventive vaccines. 3. Set up tea buckets in important areas for members to drink from. (C) Regarding the collection of overdue membership fees, it was resolved to issue a notice and then send personnel to collect the fees. (Remainder omitted)</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions</p>
<p>Fellow rickshaw pullers, recalling last summer, when the Public Concession authorities wanted to increase our levies, this association, considering that the industry could not bear the burden, after repeated struggles and negotiations, finally achieved the goal of abolishing the increased levies. But the second difficulty has now fallen on our industry, which is that the Public Concession has decided that starting from July 1st of this year, our industry must either widen the wheels to three and a half inches wide, or convert to rubber tires. Now, the Public Concession's Announcement No. 4642 regarding this matter is copied below: "Announcement Regarding the matter of, from July 1, 1936, all rickshaws must be equipped with flat-edged iron tires that are at least three and a half inches wide, or solid rubber tires that are at least two inches wide. This announcement is specially made for public knowledge." This announcement, dated November 21, 1935, by Acting Director-General Felippo, is as serious as last year's increase in levies. After learning about this matter, this association expressed the following opinions: 1. Widening the wheels will definitely make movement more cumbersome and inconvenient. 2. Given the poor state of the economy in recent years, it will be economically impossible for the industry to replace all the wheels. 3. If we are talking about converting to rubber tires, that is even more unaffordable, because a set of rubber tires currently costs over ten yuan. 4. At the same time, rubber tires are not durable and need to be replaced every two years. How can people who earn a living by the sweat of their brow have such strength? This association has also sent a letter to the Public Concession with the above points, requesting consideration of the difficult times and exemption from implementation, but it has not been accepted. Now, the implementation period of July 1st is approaching in the blink of an eye. For the sake of seriousness, this association has specially formulated a form to solicit opinions from the industry, which will be distributed to all members. After receiving it, please indicate either "Agree", "Oppose", or "Postpone" on the form, based on your own opinion, and add a "+" sign and send it to this association for statistics to be used as a basis for negotiation. The situation is very urgent, so please do not delay. Finally, I would like to tell my colleagues that to get rid of any pain, 1. It is necessary to unite. With unity, we can have the power to resist. This is very clear. Therefore, at this critical juncture, I cannot but hope that colleagues who have not yet joined the association will join quickly, so that we can act together and increase the power of negotiation.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Hua Dong Company's Special Reward Lawsuit Has Many Disputes, Xie Hengchuan Sues Zhang Duchen <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Requesting a Declaration That Resolutions A and B of the Shareholders' Meeting Are Invalid. Yesterday, the Special First Court Summoned the Parties and Will Re-examine After Investigating the Case Files.</p>
<p>The Hua Dong Coal Mine Company was reorganized from the Jia Zai Coal Mine Company. Liu Hongniu, a director of the company, had promised to borrow 800,000 yuan for Hua Dong, with a special reward of 3 jiao per ton of coal sold in addition to the interest. Because the loan did not materialize, Gu Zonglin, the former manager, promised to raise a loan of 1 million yuan, with a special reward of 5 jiao per ton. However, as a result, the loan was not obtained, but the special reward was still extracted. The creditors, Daji Company Yan Huiyu, as well as Jincheng and Yanye Banks, considered this to be a great damage to their creditor's rights. They then hired lawyer Qiu Fenling to sue the company's general manager and directors Zhang Duchen, Hua Runquan, Xie Hengchuan, Xu Zhiyi, Bao Zidan, Tian Youfu, Lu Yinfu, Sheng Minreng, Li Bake, Wang Jianxun, He Jingfu, Li Yuliang, Liu Hongsheng, Gu Zonglin, and fourteen others at the First Special District Court, seeking affirmation that the defendants' extraction of a</p>
<p>special reward of 150,000 yuan in the 24th year was invalid. This case has been heard several times by the Special Court. Because the defendant Xie Hengchuan was willing to mediate, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing. It was reported in this newspaper that Xie Hengchuan recently hired lawyer Xu Jie to file a complaint with the Special First Court against Hua Dong Coal Mine Co., Ltd. and its legal representative Zhang Duchen, adding reasons and requesting a declaration that Resolutions A and B of the defendant company's Fourth Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders held on April 24th of this year are invalid. Yesterday afternoon, this case was opened by Judge Meng Tingke in the Fourteenth Civil Court. The defendant hired lawyer Xu Shihao to defend. According to the plaintiff's agent, lawyer Xu Jie, the Hua Dong Coal Mine Company held its Fourth Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders on April 24th of this year. All shareholders attended and voted to pass the following</p>
<p>two resolutions: A. Lawyer Qiu Fenling was entrusted by the old creditors and advance payment creditors of the Jia Zai Coal Mine to discuss the special reward issue. The company should respond to the warning letter by stating that Qiu Fenling's letter is an unwarranted interference and infringement on the company's rights. A warning letter should be sent immediately, stating that the lawyer and their clients shall be liable for compensation if any actions cause direct or indirect damage to the company. Shareholders Hua Runquan and Xie Peide seconded the motion. A public vote was taken, and Li Yuliang and Xie Peide were elected as vote counters.</p>
<p>The vote count showed 14 votes in favor, totaling 1,290 shares, and 1 vote against, totaling 10 shares. The 10 shares were from Xie Hengchuan, the plaintiff in this case. The majority voted to pass. B. The previous resolution on the special reward, which had been legally passed, should be maintained because some directors had created incidents afterwards, causing disputes and affecting the company's future. The original resolution should be maintained. Shareholders Xu Zhiyi moved that the original resolution should be maintained since it had already been legally passed. Shareholder Hua Runquan seconded the motion. A public vote was taken, and shareholders Li Yuliang and Xie Peide were again elected as vote counters. The vote count showed 10 votes in favor, totaling 858 shares, and 5 votes against, totaling 442 shares. Another majority voted to pass. Shareholders with a special</p>
<p>conflict of interest in the matters of the meeting are not allowed to participate in the vote or act as proxy for other shareholders to exercise their voting rights. Furthermore, if the convening or resolution of the shareholders' meeting violates laws, regulations, or the company's articles of association, the shareholders may, within one month from the date of the resolution, petition the court to declare the resolution invalid. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 131 and 137 of the Company Law, it is requested that Resolutions A and B be declared invalid. The defendant's lawyer, Xu Shihao, then requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed, stating that the plaintiff Xie Hengchuan and the defendant Zhang Duchen are both shareholders and directors of the Hua Dong Coal Mine Company. Now, what qualifications does the plaintiff have to file the lawsuit in this case? Furthermore, although the object of the special reward in another lawsuit is currently 150,000 yuan, the plaintiff's lawyer in that case has repeatedly stated that the total special reward is 63 yuan. The filing fee paid by the plaintiff in this case is 4 yuan and 5 jiao, which is inconsistent. The court ordered the case files to be investigated before the retrial.</p>

<p>Rescuing a Qian-Surnamed Child from the Bottom of the River</p>
<p>The Zhengmeng Elementary School in Longwangmiao Town, Pudong, was jointly founded by the Shanghai Jisheng Society and the Shanghai Public Education Practice Association and has been in existence for eleven years. It also serves as a rural service center, providing services such as smallpox vaccinations, medicine distribution, and public speaking, which are highly praised by the villagers. On May 30th of this year, a Qian-surnamed child, seventeen years old, accidentally fell into the Yujia Creek north of the school. A crowd gathered, but everyone was afraid to enter the water to save him because the current was too swift. Fu Lintao, a student at Zhengmeng Elementary School, only thirteen years old, passed by and witnessed the situation. He immediately jumped into the water and, after more than ten minutes, dragged the Qian child out of the river. The Qian child was already unconscious. After being rescued by the crowd, he finally came back to life. It was later learned that the Qian child was the only son of three families. The grief and gratitude of his parents cannot be described. Fu Lintao, Mr. Yi Jun, and Principal Ni Zijia decided to reward Fu, take his photo and hang it in the school, and inscribe the words "Righteousness and Courage" to encourage others.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Yan Yuying Appeals to Liu Dongbao to Restore Mother-Son Relationship <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Dismissed by the Court, Yan Prepares to Appeal</p>
<p>Liu Chengru, a wealthy man from Nanxun, enjoyed a life of pleasure in his prime. Around the founding of the Republic, under the encouragement of a Mr. Shan Tao, he redeemed a famous prostitute, Ms. Yan, also known as Yuying, from her profession and took her as a concubine. Unexpectedly, she was not accepted by his legal wife, so Liu took advantage of an official appointment to Qingdao to build a golden house for her. Before long this was discovered, and Liu's wife came to Qingdao as well. She was very jealous of Dongbao, the son born to Yan, and forced Liu and Yan to return to Shanghai. From then on, Yan was increasingly mistreated. Unable to endure this, Yan left and went north alone, resuming her previous occupation in Tianjin and was unfortunately arrested by the local police. Upon hearing the news in Shanghai, Liu was moved by the old feelings and, unable to stand by, still enlisted Ye Shantao to rescue her from Tianjin. She then returned to Shanghai and lived in Yide Lane, Zhejiang Road. It was thought that with the legal wife and the concubine living separately, as Yin and Xing avoided each other, they could live in peace. Unexpectedly, Liu's feelings had changed from love to dislike, and eventually, they had to separate. Both parties signed a separation agreement. To cut off all ties and prevent future disputes, Liu stated in the agreement that Dongbao was not born to Yan. At that time, Yan refused to agree to this clause, as this would mean permanently severing her mother-son relationship with Dongbao. However, after repeated persuasion by Ye Shantao, she was told that when Dongbao grew up, there was no reason why a biological son would not recognize his biological mother. If she insisted on her opinion now, the 8,000 yuan in alimony would become a mirage. As she desperately needed money at the time, she had no choice but to accept the mediator's proposal. Thus, mother and son became strangers. Last year, Liu Chengru passed away, and Dongbao is now an adult. Yan recalled Ye Shantao's words and, considering the deep bond between mother and son, requested Dongbao to restore their mother-son relationship. Unexpectedly, Dongbao refused. Helpless, she filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, requesting that the clause in the separation agreement stating that there was no mother-son relationship between her and Dongbao be declared invalid. However, the defendant used the agreement as a defense, resulting in the loss of the first trial. Yan refused to accept this outcome and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Ye Shantao and Chen Yuxiang were both summoned to testify. Chen testified that Liu Chengru had indeed told him before his death that Dongbao was born to Yan. Ye, however, testified that he had only heard Yan say that Liu Dongbao was her son and did not provide any details about the</p>
<p>past events. After the arguments were made, the case was declared and dismissed. Yan's depression remained unresolved and she is preparing to appeal to the Supreme Court, hoping to reverse the situation and reunite with her son.</p>

<p>The Murderer, Wang Dalong, Was Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>At the end of Linping Road Bridge in Zhabei, at around 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, a vendor, Li Guoyou (from Yancheng, 43 years old, residing in a thatched hut in Fenshui Temple), was arguing with a worker from a yarn factory, Wang Dalong (from Funing, 25 years old, also residing in a thatched hut in Fenshui Temple), over two copper coins for buying broad beans. They began to fight, and Li was fatally injured by punches, his testicles were kicked and crushed. He died on the spot. The murderer, Wang Dalong, was seized by the deceased's daughter, Li Zhaodi (22 years old), and reported to the police for detention. The deceased's wife, Mrs. Huang (39 years old), said that she had an elderly mother-in-law and four children, who depended on her husband for a living. She was deeply saddened by his tragic death. Yesterday afternoon at 4:40 p.m., the District Court sent prosecutor Kong Xianglin and clerk Wang Zhenxin, along with bailiffs, to the scene to examine the body. Mrs. Li Huang, Li Zhaodi, and many other male and female relatives of Li were wailing and crying incessantly, shouting injustice. The police rushed to maintain order before examining the body. The deceased's mouth was frothing with blood, his body was covered with purple bruises, and blood was flowing from his left testicle. Prosecutor Kong then stated that the deceased had indeed died from his injuries. He then got into his car to return to the court, but Mrs. Li Huang and others blocked his way. After being persuaded by the bailiffs, Prosecutor Kong promised to severely punish the murderer before they were able to get rid of the situation. The police station considered the case to be a murder, and yesterday they have handed over the murderer Wang Dalong to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

The association's announcement is recorded as follows: "We, the soybean curd industry, are all small businesses.

<p>China National Goods Maintenance Association Inquires about Detailed Measures</p>
<p>In order to prosper the market and support the development of domestic goods industry and commerce in the area, the Chinese Zhabei Water and Electricity Company has recently stipulated preferential treatment for domestic goods factories and industrial electricity within the district. The company's person in charge suggested to the China National Goods Maintenance Association that it notify the member businesses and factories in Zhabei to adopt the policy. The association submitted this to the Second Executive Committee Meeting for discussion. All members believed that the number of domestic goods businesses and factories using current-driven engines was very large. If they could enjoy preferential treatment, the factories could not only reduce production costs, but also the company's enthusiasm for promoting domestic goods would be admirable. However, the details of the preferential treatment were not clear, making it difficult to pass them on. Therefore, it was decided to send a letter to the Water and Electricity Company requesting it to provide written details of the preferential treatment for domestic goods factories and industrial electricity in order to pass it on. In the future, after the implementation of this preferential treatment, domestic goods factories will benefit significantly in this economic downturn.</p>

<p>Book cover crepe, in its use for the book industry, has always been extremely important. Because our country did not have its own products, it has relied on foreign goods for years, with annual losses approaching millions of dollars. Now, Messrs. Zhu Shilie and Sun Siyi have dedicated five years of effort and hundreds of experiments to complete the domestically produced book cover crepe. The quality is excellent, not inferior to imported goods. Its advantages are that it is waterproof, does not fade in the sun, is not easily eaten by insects, does not mold, and the price is very low. They have now established a factory at No. 357 Kangqu Road in the South City, named "Cultural Lacquered Cloth Weaving Factory." All the machinery ordered from the Qiaoxin Iron Factory in Shanghai has been completely installed. Within a month, their products will be available.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cigarette Exchange Trade Association, due to fierce business competition among all industry members and non-members in the city, had reached a point where goods prices were extremely chaotic.

Chen Ruilin, Chai Zaiyuan, Mi Chuxin, Zhang Bingyuan, Yu Ai Yu, Shen Yinhe, and Chen Kunxian were elected as members of the Trade Regulations Implementation Committee. Yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock, they convened an inaugural meeting. After the committee members were sworn into office, they continued to hold the first committee meeting, passing fourteen articles of the organizational outline. They also plan to invite several members to be selected and appointed by the association for evaluation, publicity, and persuasion to assist in the handling of matters, with a scheduled implementation date. It is heard that the outline will be submitted to the nineteenth executive committee meeting for approval within days, and then submitted to the competent government authority for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>A Maid Accuses a Monk of Xuebao Temple of Seduction and Rape - Acquitted After Genital Examination</p>
<p>Miao Hui, the abbot of the Xue Dou Temple branch in Dong Youheng Road, dismissed his employed maid, Lu Liu, after which she filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, criminally accusing Miao Hui of seducing, raping, and impregnating her. Furthermore, she accused Lang Qing, a monk from the same temple, of secretly administering abortifacient medicine under the guise of treating her illness, resulting in a miscarriage. She requested that they be punished. After repeated summons and trials, the defendants vehemently denied the seduction and abortion charges. They hired lawyer Hong Shihao to defend them, arguing that the plaintiff was fabricating the charges to deceive and extort. The judge, seeing that both parties' statements were contradictory and fearing difficulty in ascertaining the truth, Lu Liu unexpectedly declared that she knew Miao Hui's genitals were unusually small, which she could not know unless they had shared a bed. Hearing this, Miao Hui admitted that his genitals were large. Therefore, the judge ordered the defendant to be examined by a forensic doctor. However, determining the size of this object was difficult to standardize, so the forensic doctor had to draw a picture of Miao Hui's private parts as they were, with the size exactly as it was. Thus, the truth of the case became clear. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang announced the verdict that both Miao Hui and Lang Qing were not guilty.</p>

On May 14th, the Shanghai newspapers published an advertisement by Wang Xiaolai, stating, 'Xiaolai has served society for nearly thirty years, with a sincere heart of self-love and patriotism, and an aspiration to save the country. In dealing with people and affairs, I am sincere and fair. In my roles in various social organizations, I have always encouraged myself with the words, "My virtue is insufficient to convince people, and my talent is insufficient to adapt to changes." Since the establishment of the Shanghai Fish Market, Xiaolai has been publicly elected as the general manager. As it concerns industry, I do not shirk from hard work and complaints. What comforts me is that I did not seek this position, nor do I rely on it for a living. Unexpectedly, a so-called Shanghai Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations has widely distributed leaflets, arbitrarily slandering me. Based on the facts, it is clear. Xiaolai has always been upright. Occasionally, in presiding over social affairs, I have promoted and demoted personnel, causing resentment. But Xiaolai is unashamed and has a clear conscience. Having lived in Shanghai for thirty years, I have never accepted illicit gains and remain penniless, which is known to all. As for the address and responsible person of the Shanghai Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations printed on the leaflet with a "needle" mark, I am willing to meet them face to face and publicly question them. I, Xiaolai, should conduct a thorough investigation to seek legal sanctions. I hereby declare this plainly, hoping for public consideration.' Since the publication of the advertisement, several days have passed, and no responsible person from the so-called Shanghai Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations has stepped forward to meet Wang Xiaolai, causing even more unease among the people of Shanghai. Since the New Life Movement, propriety, justice, integrity, and shame have become the prevailing ethos, and the punishment of corruption has become the law. Wang Xiaolai holds an important position. If there are any misdeeds as claimed by the so-called Shanghai Federation of Industrial and Commercial Associations, they should be thoroughly investigated in accordance with the law. We should not let it go unpunished. The law has specific provisions for those who make false accusations. Since this matter involves responsible personnel in society, the government should conduct a rigorous investigation to protect the righteous spirit of society and families, punish those who undermine discipline, and commend those who are upright and selfless. This will rectify public opinion and maintain law and order. Therefore, we earnestly petition for a review of Wang Xiaolai's conduct and request a prompt and thorough investigation in accordance with the law, without leniency or injustice, and without errors. Society will be fortunate, and the nation will be fortunate. We are sincerely grateful."</p>

<p>Wang Xiuying, 18, and Liu Lanying, 26, both female attendants at the Nanjing Central Barber Shop, are natives of Nanjing. They specialize in manicuring customers' nails and serving tea and cigarettes. They are elegantly dressed and have pleasing appearances. Recently, they were lured by a certain Hu and boarded the Ewo Company's Hesheng ship to Tianjin the day before yesterday. Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the Women and Children Relief Association, boarded the ship and questioned them. The two women claimed that they were visiting relatives in a lane in the Tianjin Japanese Concession. Chen and others found out that there were many brothels in that lane, and it was clear that the two women had been targeted by criminals. They repeatedly asked if anyone else was traveling with them. The two women then revealed Hu as an accomplice. The two officers waited until the ship was about to depart but did not see Hu board, suspecting that he had escaped due to exposure. They then took the two women away and informed them of the dangers of falling into a pit of fire in Tianjin. The two women woke up as if from a dream and cried. The association has sent letters to the families of the two women in Nanjing, asking them to come to Shanghai to claim them.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Three Trafficking Cases Cracked Inside the Huashan Maru <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The trend of luring and kidnapping children is rampant. On the 22nd of last month, four children were kidnapped on Rue de Coullers in the French Concession, and three children were kidnapped on Rue de Conthay. Seven children were lost in a single day, which is truly shocking. It is said that the child traffickers sell the kidnapped children to Xiamen and Shantou, where each child can be sold for 100 to 150 yuan. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, investigators from the China Women and Children Relief Association, together with customs water police detectives Qu He Kui and Xu Juelu, went to the third-class cabin of the Japanese Qing Company's Huashan Maru, which was berthed at the old pier in the east of the Bund, and cracked three trafficking cases. Chen Jinkui from Chaozhou and his concubine Chen Aying from Dingxi jointly kidnapped a six-year-old Ningbo child named Kong Ximin. Yang Yao, a woman from Pudong (also known as Sanmei), lured and kidnapped an eleven-year-old Chuansha girl named Zhou Lindi. Chen Along from Wenzhou and his concubine Chen Xie from Guangdong jointly kidnapped a six-year-old Shandong child named Changsheng. The cases were exposed due to contradictions in the statements between the traffickers and the children. All eight individuals, adults and children, were taken to the water police station for separate interrogations. Chen Jinkui and Chen Aying confessed that they lived in the attic on the third floor of No. 98 Rue Massenet in the French Concession. On the eighth day of the first lunar month, they, along with accomplices Gong Zhengming (also known as A Ming) and Wang A'er, kidnapped three boys in Shanghai and took the Huashan Maru to Xiamen, where they earned 330 yuan. The second time was on the ninth day of the third lunar month, when they kidnapped another boy and also took the Huashan Maru to Xiamen, earning 190 yuan. This was their third time. Gong Zhengming first kidnapped a girl named Zhou Lindi, and then Yang Yao kidnapped Kong Ximin. They were hidden in their attic on the third floor, waiting to be shipped out of the country. According to Yang Yao's confession, she still tried to deny it. According to the joint confessions of Chen Along and Chen Xie, they insisted that the child Changgen was their own, but Changgen spoke with a Shandong accent, which was clearly untrue. According to the girl Zhou Lindi, her parents lived on Rue Pichon. Kong Ximin said that his father was deceased, his mother was alive, and they lived in Shou'anfang on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. When Changgen was questioned, he did not answer the questions, only saying that his father sold fish, and he knew nothing else. The detectives rushed to arrest the fugitives Gong Zhengming and Wang A'er, but they had already fled upon hearing the news. They also went to Rue Pichon to find the family of the girl Zhou Lindi. When they found the destination, families who had lost children at that location came to inquire about the whereabouts of their children. For a moment, both Rue Pichon and Rue de Conthay were in an uproar, with over a hundred onlookers gathering to see the faces of the traffickers the detectives were bringing. Some even pointed and scolded them. The detectives took the family of Zhou Lindi to the station to identify the faces and, after confirming they were correct, waited to escort the traffickers and children to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation this morning before returning them.</p>

<p>At approximately 1:00 AM yesterday, a woman, about fifteen or sixteen years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt, black woolen pants, black satin embroidered shoes, white silk socks, and a white calico undershirt and pants, suddenly threw herself into the Huangpu River outside the Bund on Beijing Road. A Chinese constable numbered 2880 of the General Patrol Bureau caught sight of her and called upon passersby to assist in rescuing her. However, she was already unable to speak. An ambulance was summoned to rush her to Shanghai Nursing Home for treatment, but to no avail. She soon died. The relevant police station ordered detective Zhu Wanjun to investigate. A pawn ticket from a pawnshop in the South City and keys were found near the deceased, leading to the belief that she had taken this step due to financial difficulties. The body was transported to the Forensic Examination Office on Rue Frelon. At around 10:00 AM, Prosecutor Zhang Zongru from the First Special Court arrived at the office, examined the body, and declared that the unidentified female deceased had died by drowning herself. The body was handed over to Pushan Mountain Villa for collection.</p>

<h3 id="e168">After Firing Driver, Owner Unable to Claim Gasoline <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Investigation Reveals Embezzlement by Driver - Arrested by Police and Indicted</p>
<p>Lawyer Lu Qi, styled Shaoyou, a native of Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, became a member of the Shanghai Lawyers Association in May of the 15th year of the Republic. He built his own residence at No. 21, Lane 774, Haining Road, named "Taolu," and owned a car, employing Wang Yunlong from Tongzhou as his driver. On the 3rd of this year, a staff member, Ji Xianxing, from the Hebei Oil Station Company on Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, came to Lu Qi's residence to sell gasoline. The deal was immediately concluded. Lu Qi handed over a set of checks totaling 108 yuan in national currency to the driver Wang Yunlong to deliver to Ji Xianxing. Ji then gave him a book for collecting gasoline, so that Lu could continuously claim gasoline. Unexpectedly, after Wang Yunlong was dismissed for some reason, Lu Qi asked the newly hired driver to claim gasoline from the Hebei Oil Station Company, but was refused. Lu Qi believed that the gasoline price had been paid in full, so he questioned the rejection. After repeated negotiations, he learned that the former driver Wang Yunlong had embezzled the gasoline money. He reported to the Huishi Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Wang at No. 585 Yulin Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Wang was sent to the Criminal Court No. 88 of the First Special Court. The police station prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. Lawyer Lu Qi then filed a complaint, stating that in his opinion, the defendant Wang Yunlong seemed to have colluded with Ji Xianxing, a staff member of the Hebei Oil Station Company, and requested a postponement. Wang Yunlong confessed that at that time, he had an urgent need and was acquainted with Ji Xianxing, so he secretly negotiated with Ji to temporarily use the money. If gasoline was needed, he would pay it back. Now that his job had been terminated, Ji no longer trusted him, leading to this case. Judge Huang reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, awaiting a rescheduled trial.</p>

<p>Public Prosecution Withdrawn After Admission of Fault</p>
<p>Tao Dejun, styled Ya Yi Kun, a native of Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, has been a judge at the Civil Court of the Shanghai First Special District Court for several years. He resides at No. 18, Derun Lane, Rue Hearn. At around 10 AM on May 22nd, Tao's nine-year-old daughter, Wei Qin, was playing in the lane when she somehow had an argument with Er Mao, the six-year-old daughter of Shi Zhang, a Tianjin woman residing at No. 8. Shi Zhang came out and helped her daughter beat Wei Qin. Wei Qin went home and told her mother, Tang, who went to argue with Shi Zhang. Unexpectedly, Shi Zhang was unreasonable and, together with her mother Shi Yang, insulted and beat Tao Tang. Chinese constable No. 2694 was summoned and brought Xuan Zhang and Shi Yang to the Huishi Police Station, sending Tao Tang and her daughter to Tongren Hospital to verify the injuries. Both parties were ordered to leave. A formal public prosecution was filed with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Shi Zhang and Shi Yang of joint assault, violating Article 277 of the Criminal Law. The court approved the complaint and issued a summons. Yesterday, both women were summoned to the court, where Judge Tan Xinzhen presided over the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the police station, stated the above circumstances, saying that the victim Tao Tang had stated at the police station that if the defendants admitted their mistake in court, she would not pursue the matter further. According to the police station's indictment, it was a complaint that could be withdrawn. Tao Tang then recounted the incident, and Shi Zhang and Shi Yang admitted their mistake. Tao Tang then stated that she requested a withdrawal. The court ruled that the public prosecution be withdrawn.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Wang Yousheng Sues for Confirmation of Divorce Agreement as Invalid <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Wang Miaohe, a local resident of No. 3 Landitang, Ludu, Pudong, is over seventy years old. His elderly wife, Wang Bao, is of a similar age. They have no son, only a daughter named Caibao, who is twenty-five years old this year. Due to lineage concerns, Wang recruited Wang Yousheng, also a local, as his son-in-law. In the 14th year of the Republic, Wang Yousheng joined the family as a prospective son-in-law. In the 18th year, he married Caibao. Initially, they lived in harmony, but later, due to financial disputes, they signed a divorce agreement on January 28th of this year. Recently, Wang Yousheng hired lawyer Yu Bin and filed a petition with the Shanghai District Court, requesting confirmation that the divorce agreement was invalid and demanding to continue living together, claiming that he was forced to sign the agreement by his parents-in-law and others who gathered hooligans, and that it was not his true intention. Yesterday afternoon at 2 PM, Judge Feng opened the trial. The plaintiff did not attend, but lawyer Yu attended on his behalf. He stated that the plaintiff Wang Yousheng, aged 28, a Shanghai native, currently residing at No. 76 Yuanfu Lane, Kunming Road, Hongkou, had been in the foreign goods business. In the 14th year of the Republic, he was introduced by Zhong You, the owner of the Yongcheng Cotton Company, to Wang Miaohe and Wang Bao to be their adopted son. He provided all his monthly salary to the defendants' home. Thus, in the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic, Wang and his wife obtained the consent of their daughter Caibao and married the plaintiff. They were harmonious, but in the winter of last year, the plaintiff lost his job due to the market downturn. The defendants then constantly provoked trouble, so there were no peaceful days in the home. On January 19th of this year, Caibao left home for no reason and did not return. On January 28th, Wang Bao instructed the plaintiff to go to room 447 of the East Asia Hotel on Nanjing Road to look for her. Unexpectedly, upon entering, he was forced to sign a divorce agreement by more than ten hooligans who had been gathered beforehand. Since then, the plaintiff has been unfortunate and suffering from illness, currently residing in a relative's home. Therefore, he requested that the divorce agreement be confirmed as invalid and demanded to live together. Wang Miaohe did not attend, but Wang Bao and her daughter Wang Caibao attended and stated that Wang Yousheng did not engage in honest work, but was engaged in vagrancy. When he had no money, he would go home to cause trouble, forcefully demanding money to spend outside. If he was not satisfied, he would destroy the furniture and beat his wife. At the end of the lunar year, he forced his wife to hand over the land deed for mortgage, and when he was unsuccessful, he beat his wife with his fists and feet. Unable to endure the abuse, she temporarily stayed at her sister's house to avoid his attacks. Seeing that his demands were not met, the plaintiff invited Mr. Wang, an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, to discuss the divorce, asking for 500 yuan. Later, they agreed on 200 yuan and signed the divorce agreement. Of all the money, 100 yuan was cash, and 100 yuan was used to offset the deposit of the tea house at the Continental Hotel. It was the plaintiff who requested the divorce. Having already divorced, it would be difficult to reconcile. They requested that the lawsuit be dismissed. The court considered that it was necessary to summon witnesses in this case and adjourned the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Great China University's 12th Anniversary Yesterday <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Great China University has been established for twelve years. Yesterday was the anniversary of the school's founding. All school buildings were opened to welcome visitors, and alumni were invited back to the school on May 31st for a reunion dinner. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that a commemorative meeting was held in the gymnasium at 9 AM yesterday. In addition to President Wang Boqun, Vice President Ou Yuanhuai, and professors Wang Zhiwei, Chuan Shishuo, Lu Jihui, Wu Haoran, Shao Jialin, Sun Haodeng, Ren Mengxian, and Lan Chunchi, as well as over 1,600 graduates and students, board members in attendance included Jiang Wenyu, Zhang Zhuping, and Zhao Jinqing. Guests included Director Pan Gongzhan and Jiang Jianbai. The meeting was chaired by President Wang Boqun, who delivered the opening remarks, stating that the school has made significant progress in both material and spiritual terms in a very short time, which is the result of the cooperation of teachers and students. This year's anniversary coincides with a time of national crisis, and no extravagance that would undermine national strength will be undertaken. He expressed the hope that all professors and students would uphold the past spirit of perseverance and hard work, teach and learn diligently, and continue to strive to achieve the goal of revitalizing national education. Vice President Ou Yuanhuai then reported on the school's operations over the past twelve years, stating that the school was established in 1924 by over two hundred students and some professors who left Xiamen University to come to Shanghai. At that time, there was no place to stand, and it was completely like a "congenitally deficient" infant. After its establishment, it experienced many difficulties and setbacks before it could have the rudiments of its current scale, just like a "child with many acquired difficulties." The school's financial difficulties have not yet escaped the state of 1924, and he hoped that all students and people from all walks of life would provide appropriate assistance. Director Pan Gongzhan then delivered a speech with much encouragement, stating that if the school's colleagues could continue the past spirit of teacher-student cooperation and work hard, they would definitely be able to overcome the difficulties. Board members Jiang Wenyu and Zhao Jinqing then delivered speeches, and graduate representative Zhang Zhonghuan delivered a speech. Finally, everyone sang the school song and the meeting adjourned. Guests and board members visited the school's science hall, which has been increasingly enriched in recent years, after the meeting. They were personally guided by Shao Jialin, the dean of the College of Science. In the afternoon, the school's students held friendly ball games with the affiliated high schools of Jinan and Fudan Universities, the School of Taxation, and the China Women's Physical Education College, it is said.</p>

<p>Market Conditions Initially Firm Then Uncertain, Resulting in a Further Increase of 2.4 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was stirred by the reversed rise in Customs Gold, which aroused people's feelings. The market opened with an upward trend, but later, due to multiple parties selling off, the actions of the three banks to force down the exchange rate finally calmed the market. Ultimately, the market was uncertain. Initially, overseas telegrams reported that the US market was completely closed, and that the prices of London's large bars and Montevideo's forward silver rose slightly. Exchange rates decreased slightly, and London's raw gold decreased by half a penny. Over-the-counter preliminary transactions opened at 39.0 yuan, with little trading.

It once rose after the opening, but due to large investors closing out their positions, it turned to hovering, and there was no special change in the result. Yesterday, the futures spread was posted at 3.45 yuan by multiple parties. The market conditions for today are recorded below:</p>

<p>—Continuous Decline for a Week… A Rebound May Occur</p>
<p>Yesterday, the selling pressure intensified on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange as market prices continued to fall. This was due to the situation in North China, with Japanese troops continuously entering China. The current situation is of extreme importance. The Northern Faction in the market showed signs of panic, leading to a significant amount of government bonds being sold. However, most people remain steadfast. Current news and developments are significantly influencing the market. However, after a week of continuous price declines, a rebound should be anticipated.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the downward trend was evident from the opening of the morning session. The November 11th contract saw consistent selling, with Class D forward contracts falling sharply by 0.06 yuan, and other contracts also declining by 0.03 or 0.05 yuan. Contracts 47 and 18 were also sold off. Contract 4 also saw more selling than buying. At the close, although retail investors and those holding Contract 4 had some demand, the market was unable to recover due to the heavy selling pressure from the Northern Faction and those holding contracts 5 and 10. Therefore, even though prices were slightly better by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan before the opening, the sentiment was dampened again after Contract A forward fell by 0.04 yuan due to selling by number 14. At the close, only Class B forward contracts saw a slight rebound of 0.015 yuan, while the rest remained weak. Although there were over 100,000 shares of Class A forward sold by number 14, the market only fell by 0.005 yuan. Despite the strong downward pressure, major long positions did not appear to be liquidating in large quantities.</p>
<p>As a result, Class D forward contracts fell the most, declining by 0.08 yuan, while Class A spot contracts fell the least, declining by 0.035 yuan. The total transaction volume was 63,600 yuan. The final results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending weaker, showing a slight downturn. This is due to the deteriorating situation in North China, which has weakened market sentiment. Prices are depressed, but major players have not yet taken action, so the decline is relatively moderate. The November yarn futures market is mostly bearish, and short sellers are becoming active again. Sales of spot yarn by the Sichuan clique are still good.</p>
<p>Price of Traded Yarn Falls Step by Step</p>
<p>In the morning session for traded yarn, prices for different months varied. They rose or fell by 0.04 or 0.05 yuan. Indian cotton performed well. Later, due to poor market sentiment, Chang Feng, Sheng Yuan, Xin Cheng, etc., continued to sell, but De Da bought in large quantities. However, this still could not curb the selling pressure. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.03, 0.07, or 0.09 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. This month alone fell by 1.13 yuan. In the afternoon session, the market was still dominated by rumors, and prices fell step by step. The September and October contracts broke through the 200 yuan level. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.03, 0.06, 0.07, or 0.08 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price.</p>
<p>It was found that 1,250 bales of Da Fu were sold, 550 bales of Tai Xing, 1,100 bales of Chang Feng, 400 bales of Xie Cheng, 1,600 bales of Xin Cheng, 3,450 bales of Geng Feng, 1,250 bales of Sen Kang, 900 bales of Run Kang, and 400 bales of Ji Feng.

<p>—Due to Weak Yarn Market and Falling Expectations for New Cotton—</p>
<p>The cotton market initially strengthened but then weakened, and the situation is deteriorating. Due to the weak yarn market and persistent negative sentiment, many long positions were liquidated. Furthermore, the recent favorable weather conditions have led to widespread expectations of falling prices for new cotton. However, the strength of Indian cotton is exceptionally strong. July and August white cotton prices have reached 209 rupees.</p>
<p>New Cotton Prospects are Poor</p>
<p>The traded cotton market opened strongly in the morning session, with American cotton suspended from trading and Indian cotton of all grades soaring by 0.03 or 0.04 rupees. Market sentiment was shaken, and sellers decreased. The immediate term market was tight. For contracts further out, prospects for new cotton were poorer. After the second session, the market was influenced by rumors that were unfavorable to long positions. At the same time, the yarn market fell, and the cotton market followed suit. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.005 to 0.015 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon session opened with negative sentiment, and prices gradually eased. However, spot cotton prices were very firm, but this was not enough to stimulate market sentiment. As a result, prices for each month fell by 0.015 to 0.03 yuan compared to the morning session's closing price.</p>
<p>It was found that 2,600 dan of Da Fu were sold, 1,700 dan of Tong Ji, 1,200 dan of Da Feng, 1,000 dan of Ming De, 2,500 dan of He Xing, 4,100 dan of Geng Feng, 1,300 dan of Rui Da, 3,100 dan of Ren Feng, 1,100 dan of Da Chang, 5,500 dan of Xin Chang, and 1,000 dan of Yuan Xing Chang. De Da bought 6,300 dan, Zhen Da 1,500 dan, Shen Ji 1,100 dan, Tai Chang 1,100 dan, Run Kang 3,000 dan, Chang He 1,900 dan, Ju Xing 1,400 dan, Shen Chang 1,600 dan, Jin Kang 1,600 dan, Yu Da 1,100 dan, and Yuan Da 1,500 dan. The daily high, low, and closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Prices are Firm</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is still good, and factories continue to purchase. Therefore, spot cotton prices are firm. There were 561 bales of Yao cotton from Lai Yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for various months initially fell and then rose. Wheat quotations showed no market in Chicago, while Canadian wheat was slightly better by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. As the weather has turned sunny and warm recently, and the climate is normal, prices for all months fell consistently at the opening due to favorable conditions. The lowest price for June reached 2.98 yuan, and far-month contracts also fell by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. However, by the second session, due to sluggish factory sales and short covering by outside speculators, sentiment for various months turned positive again. June, in particular, was beset with obstacles, and people paid close attention. By the opening of the afternoon session, sellers for June were scarce, and buying interest was strong. The market continued to strengthen. Contracts for July and beyond also saw tighter bids as factories remained cautious. The November contract was traded again, opening at 2.83 yuan and closing at 2.965 yuan, up 0.035 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning, prices for various months fell sharply. Due to the favorable weather recently, the early crops in the Jiangnan area have already been harvested. Within ten days at the latest, it is expected that most of the crops will be on the market. Therefore, the clear skies have softened market sentiment. As this is a critical period for the year's planning, opening prices for all months were down 0.08 or 0.09 yuan for near-month contracts and 0.05 or 0.06 yuan for far-month contracts compared to the end of the previous month. Trading was also quite active. The afternoon session opened flat, but the market gradually improved due to the stability in the flour market and the opinion of industry insiders that the Jiangnan wheat crop may not be abundant. The spot wheat market was very quiet, with no price fluctuations. Shandong wheat opened at 4.435 yuan, with only about 300 bales traded.</p>

<p>Market Prices Immediately Rose by 0.02 or 0.03 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, digestion of early season rice suddenly became strong. Recently, the sales channels for early season rice have been gradually activating. In addition to the original local streets, there are sporadic sales channels in inland areas and the Ningbo and Quanzhou regions. Market prices have been gradually increasing. Yesterday, a Fuzhou merchant came to the market to actively purchase over 10,000 bags of Jiangxi and Jiangbei rice. The local street and inland areas also had a better appetite than in the past. The Ningbo merchant, considering the large quantity, hesitated and did not proceed. The market has not seen large sales for a long time. Once the Fujian merchant purchased in large quantities, everyone became excited. The inventory of high-quality rice has become scarce, and the price has immediately risen by 0.03 yuan. The inventory of medium-quality rice is more abundant, and the price has also increased by 0.015 to 0.02 yuan. A total of 8,240 bags of Jiangxi rice, 7,000 bags of Jiangbei rice, 450 bags of Song rice, 1,200 bags of Wenzhou and Taizhou rice, 200 bags of Zhenjiang rice, and 450 bags of Anqing rice were offered on the market.

<p>New wood ears, due to excessive spring rain, had a very ordinary harvest this year. The Nanzhang wood ears that arrived from Hankou here had a limited amount of new goods, initially opening at 90 yuan, then falling to 85 yuan. The market has slightly recovered, opening at 86 yuan, but it does not suit the appetite of Shanghai merchants, so no merchants have purchased. As for the Yichang wood ears transported from the Sichuan region to Shanghai, only 15% of the goods are new. Recently, there have been continuous arrivals, opening at 89 yuan, 3 yuan lower than the initial price.</p>

<p>Ningzhou Black Tea Prices are 0.2 to 0.3 Yuan Higher Than Last Year</p>
<p>Ningzhou black tea continued to open, and prices were also 0.2 to 0.3 yuan higher than last year. Since the opening of Qimen new black tea last week, red and green tea transactions have been very strong recently. Yuzhou Ningzhou tea from Jiangxi was also offered yesterday in the market by firms such as Jin Long Hua Xiu, who selected high-grade tribute tea, opening the first lot at 105 yuan. The set price was also 0.2 to 0.3 yuan higher than last year.</p>
<p>The Qimen black tea market had previously received telegrams from abroad, complaining that the prices were slightly high, and the high price range had shrunk by 0.27 or 0.28 yuan. However, due to the lower prices and the urgent shipping schedule, many firms, including Ying Zhuang Jin Long Yi He Tong Fu Du De, etc., have rallied and aggressively purchased, and transactions have been very active. The market is very stable.</p>
<p>Green tea sales, Tunxi Gao Zhuang Chou Xin Zhen Mei, were most active due to the imminent arrival of European ships. Selling prices increased from 135 yuan to 140 yuan. However, the price of Sui An common Zhen Mei has fallen by 0.04 or 0.05 yuan. The price of Needle Eyebrow tea with a strong character remains at 60 yuan. Other local village Ping Shui Zhen Mei Zhu tea are also being eagerly purchased. The overall tea market is actively developing.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Oil Market: Shanghai and Hankou Tung Oil Inventory Gradually Dwindling <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Selling Prices Standing Above 70 Yuan Per Dan</p>
<p>After tung oil prices in the Hankou market rose above 70 yuan per dan, they have stabilized. Although they once reached a high of 78 yuan, they quickly fell back and have been fluctuating between 72 and 73 yuan. Two weeks ago, the market rumored that there would be government control, so prices briefly fell to 69 yuan, but this was only a fleeting occurrence, and prices quickly returned above 70 yuan. Recently, there have been rumors that the United States will increase the import tax on tung oil, and there are varying opinions on whether prices will rise or fall, so the market has not been affected. Because tung oil is a unique product of our country and the United States has the largest demand, even if the output increases annually, it is still not enough to meet the needs of the world. Currently, 70-80% of the production in various producing areas has been sold. The remaining inventory is only enough to supply the market for five months. With monthly exports of over 5,000 tons, it is feared that it will only be enough to last for three months. As a result, there will be no supply for two months. Therefore, the current market price above 70 yuan is not surprising. When the old crop is exhausted and the new crop is not yet available, there may be even more surprising price increases. Before the new crop was produced last year, old oil was sold for 87 yuan. The situation is even tighter this year, so it is feared that the price will be even higher than that.</p>
<p>However, it is now heard that the Ministry of Industry has established a vegetable oil factory to improve export trade and will not allow similar oil factories to operate. Bao tung oil exports must be inspected and qualified by the Commodity Inspection Bureau before they can be shipped. Therefore, tung oil exports have already been improved. It is heard that oil merchants in the Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei provinces have jointly petitioned the government, demanding that the order be withdrawn. Oil merchants in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are still waiting and seeing.</p>

<p>The recent market for narrow strip steel has been active due to the rising prices of tinplate. Many users have switched to using narrow strip steel. Although market volume has not increased, its popularity is not comparable to other metal products. The current market price is 22.5 yuan per box (calculated at 200 pounds). It is found that there were as many as four or five hundred boxes offered on the market yesterday, mostly purchased by canning factories, cigarette factories, and paint companies. Wholesalers also made some purchases.</p>

<p>Thin sheets, which are necessary for cigarette companies and biscuit factories, have repeatedly reported price increases overseas in recent months. Therefore, few merchants have placed orders because they cannot profit. Recently, Shantou merchants and local factories have all purchased, so market goods have become scarce. Standard, good quality sheets have increased by several yuan. The current price is 68 yuan per box. However, buyers are still purchasing despite the high prices. Twenty-five boxes were offered yesterday.</p>

<p>—All Crepe in the Market is Eastern Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth sales were quiet because retail merchants had cleared their inventory and large merchants were observing the firm and expensive factory prices. Yihe Factory's light-weight coarse cloth was slightly more expensive because the factory prices were high, making it difficult to match market prices. Thirteen-pound, Nine Sky coarse cloth and eleven-pound, Three Cat coarse cloth each increased by 0.05 yuan. Sales of other goods were mediocre. White cloth sales were still more active for fine cloth, fine twill, market cloth, and eight-four cloth from various Eastern suppliers. Due to seasonal factors, cloth, printed crepe, linen gauze, and gauze silk sales were more active. All crepe on the market is currently Eastern goods. The selling price for the Ren Gou brand is 3.95 yuan per bolt, the Ren Tuo brand is 4.05 yuan, and the Hua Che brand is 3.15 yuan. Autumn fabrics such as printed large-pattern and small-pattern water wave velvet have already started selling. Guang Zhong Factory is selling them at 0.16 yuan per yard, and Heng Feng Factory is selling them at 0.175 yuan. Local wholesalers and long-distance merchants from places like Sichuan have been in discussions.</p>

<p>— (Fang Shujun)</p>
<p>"In the world, there are only things that should not be done, there are absolutely no things that cannot be done." Therefore, a person must have a clear goal and a firm ambition. The more dangerous the time, the more firm our will must be. We must seek the true joy of life from the midst of hard work, display the spirit of hard work, break through difficulties and obstacles, and achieve the ultimate goal.</p>
<p>Wilhelm II said: "The more difficult, the more firm." If we can have this spirit of hard work, then everything will be solved easily. Even if there are thousands of difficulties and hardships, we can embrace the belief that "all troubles are to help me train my mind, all dangers are to help me train my courage." Then there is no reason not to be free and content, and there is nothing to hinder us. This is also ironclad proof that "danger is our opportunity to strengthen ourselves."</p>
<p>The road of life is like climbing stairs. Each step is more difficult than the last. If we do not work hard, it will be difficult to reach the top. Therefore, "failure for want of a single basketful" is the most heartbreaking thing.</p>
<p>The most pitiful person in the world is a child without a mother, but the most hopeful person is also a child without a mother. Therefore, a person who can rise up from hardship is bound to be a noble person who is good at controlling the environment.</p>
<h3 id="e234">"Slow" <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>The underdevelopment of Chinese education is undeniable, but the emphasis on this 'slow' education is ubiquitous. Therefore, both the government and the public, men and women, young and old, treat this 'slow' word as the golden rule for establishing oneself and dealing with the world. Even now, they are still stagnating in a 'slow' state, and there is a tendency to make it even worse now.</p>
<p>For example, when a child is learning to walk, adults are always warning him to "walk slowly" and "run slowly." Of course, this is for the child's safety to avoid the danger of tripping. But this 'slow' kind of lesson has been deeply imprinted in the child's mind. Usually, when saying goodbye to a relative or friend, or when seeing a guest out, the first and last words are always "walk slowly" and "go slowly." This is naturally also well-intentioned, for fear that the other person is too tired. Furthermore, in old novels or dramas, as well as in ordinary oral communication, one can always hear the tone of "wait a minute" and "come slowly." When you hear this tone, you can imagine how leisurely they are. In addition, the Ningbo people's 'Chai Ji Sha,' our southern people's 'slow'! 'Slow!' 'Eat slowly!' 'Do it slowly!' are also just common, well-meaning admonitions. ... What is even more valuable is that there are also many indications of 'slow' in the holy books and virtuous biographies: 'Walk slowly and you will grow taller,' then people will praise you for knowing politeness; but if you are 'zealous for profit,' then you will honestly be labeled as a follower of Zhi (a famous robber). (The author is not against the holy teachings, but because later people often misunderstand the holy books and use them inappropriately). Regarding this kind of slow education, in the family, in society, and in books, because it is so serious and common, it will naturally cultivate the Chinese person's slow nature, slow habits, and traditionally be a slow follower, only believing in slow and being content with slow, and comfortable with slow.</p>
<p>In that case, it is no wonder that everything before us--from national affairs to personal studies--must be stranded in 'slowly,' I'm just afraid that one day, people will come to interfere with your slowness--ah! Really, who dares to believe that there won't be such a day--the coming of the end of slowness.</p>

<p>Every picture, what cannot be missed, is a number of lines that can be analyzed, curved, straight, thick, and thin.</p>
<p>For example, a city's framework consists of large buildings with straight lines. However, within these large buildings with straight lines, several curved lines of roadside trees must be planted to moderate the monotonous impression reflected in human vision. Therefore, very few people stroll along the main roads and four main roads. Conversely, in places like Avenue Joffre and Yuyuan Road, there are plenty of women holding men's arms, and men with their arms around women's waists, talking, laughing, and walking. This is because in Avenue Joffre and Yuyuan Road, there are three-dimensional buildings and rural gardens. In the same picture, there are straight lines and curved lines, thick lines and thin lines, unlike what is seen in main roads and four main roads, which are entirely like cabinets, chests, boxes, and caskets, seemingly a geometrical picture.</p>
<p>Indeed, every beautiful picture inevitably needs curves, but at the same time, it also needs straight lines; inevitably needs thin lines, but at the same time, it also needs thick lines. Therefore, in a desolate mountain, a pagoda composed of straight lines must be placed. In scenic spots, there are always several temples composed of straight lines. Above a river composed of curves, a stone slab bridge composed of straight lines must be built. In scenic areas that can attract tourists, if one or two three-dimensional grand hotels are hidden in the shade of green and sparse red mountain forests, it will surely give tourists an indescribable sense of pleasure. Just as in a city entirely composed of straight lines, several streamlined cars are gliding, making the dull gaze feel a lot of stimulation.</p>
<p>Therefore, in this day and age, gentlemen with square shoulders must appreciate women with curves, so that they can form a beautiful picture composed of curves and straight lines. At the same time, the face of every modern woman must also be researched by beauty experts to determine which part should be transformed into a straight line and which part should be transformed into a curve, so that they can be harmonious. Look, even these small eyebrows, some are straight, some are curved. For facial beauty, the first condition is naturally to pay attention to whether the interweaving of straight lines, curved lines, thick lines, and thin lines is harmonious.</p>

<p>Chapter 2: Fragrant Grasses and Beautiful Women, Gentle Waves Gently Entrust; Small Building, Bright Moon, Good Dreams Newly Warm</p>
<p>Guoqi took a look, then put his hands behind his back and slowly walked out of the pavilion. The man selling agate stones was calling from behind: "Sir, don't you want these stones? I have better ones here, I'll sell them to you cheaply. Our stones here are much cheaper than those at the temple." Guoqi turned his head and shook his head twice to indicate that he didn't want them. In this turning of the head, he saw that the girl was looking north towards the pavilion. Although they didn't know who each other was, as soon as their eyes met, they felt like the best of friends. Moreover, he had just said that the fragrant grasses were at the edge of the world, and that the spring scenery belonged to young people. This further showed that she had some ink in her belly, and was not an ordinary beauty. It was right to regard her as a plum blossom or an orchid. Thinking like this in his heart, he didn't dare to look at her, so he raised his head and looked at the clouds in the sky, the tiles of the pavilion, and even the acorns holding the tiles of the pavilion, which seemed to have some artistic meaning and were worth studying. Accidentally lowering his head to look straight ahead, he saw her admiring the scenery in front of the mountain, intentionally or unintentionally looking at him. Guoqi also thought that she was a lady, still very generous, and did not feel any awkwardness because they had met on the street. He, as a man, was being coy after seeing her, so he should loosen up a bit. So he struck up a conversation with the man selling agate stones and said with a smile: "You get these stones on this mountain very easily, and you still want to sell them for two copper coins apiece, that's too expensive." The vendor said with a smile: "Sir, although there are stones on the mountain, it's not easy to find good ones." As Guoqi walked towards the stall, the girl, along with two young women, also headed towards the stall. He suddenly said: "Sisters-in-law, do you think these agate stones come from this mountain? Actually, these stones are all collected from several counties near Nanjing. Although there are small stones everywhere on this mountain, there are very few good ones. Only after a heavy rain washes away the mountain soil will many stones be exposed, and then you can pick out a few good ones." As he spoke to his sisters-in-law, he looked around the pavilion. He was very generous and looked towards Guoqi's side. If you said that he was intentionally looking at people, his eyes were not specifically fixed on people. If you said that he was not looking at people, his eyes turned very flexibly towards this side. Protecting people felt a kind of indescribable pleasure. But he only paid attention to this side for a moment at the stone stall. Then he heard the young woman say "Let's go," and the three of them left the pavilion. When he left, his steps were slower than usual. He went from being in the front to being in the back, and he separated from the two sisters-in-law by a large distance. He looked back at the pavilion after every few steps until the corner at the foot of the mountain disappeared, and he could no longer see him looking back. (59)</p>

<p>— Zhu Xuefan</p>
<p>As for commerce, since the price of rubber fell, overseas Chinese merchants engaged in this business suffered miserably. Most of the rubber plantations fell into the hands of foreigners, and the impact on commerce was significant and substantial. Moreover, in recent years, the British have been monitoring overseas Chinese merchants engaged in rubber business quite strictly, and imposing various illegal and unfair restrictions, such as stipulating that Chinese cannot purchase real estate in certain areas, etc. And our overseas Chinese compatriots are passionate about patriotism, and deeply hope that the country is stable and strives for self-improvement, so that overseas Chinese merchants will not be insulted by others again. Most of the goods sold in the market are Japanese goods, or they are clearly labeled as British goods, but in fact, they are disguised. At that time, because the weather was very hot, I intended to buy a short-sleeved shirt produced by the Sanyou Industrial Society. However, there was only one Qiaoxing National Goods Company in the area, and I could not find any Sanyou products. Moreover, the goods displayed by the company were mixed and uneven. I asked why there were so many domestic national goods, why not order and sell them in batches from major domestic companies? According to the staff in the store, the price of national goods was too high, no one would buy them, and they would inevitably lose money. From this, it can be seen that the inability of national goods to develop abroad has its reasons. Moreover, although there are many overseas Chinese, there is no concrete organization. There are only associations such as guilds or hometown associations. The research institutions on how to develop the economy, commerce, and the entire overseas Chinese cause are still lacking, which is very worrying.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are divided into two factions: "Overseas Students" and "Foreign River." Overseas Chinese from Foreign River are proficient in the local language, while Overseas Student overseas Chinese only receive education from schools run by the British and do not learn the national language. Last year, due to living conditions, disputes unfortunately occurred. However, the Overseas Student overseas Chinese now know that only receiving English education is not enough to make a living in society, and they have set up a remedial national language school to remedy this, which is a good phenomenon. As for the overall education of overseas Chinese, it is still not universal. Although there are more than 300 primary schools, there is only one overseas Chinese male middle school and four female middle schools. Moreover, educational administration is often subject to various restrictions by the British, such as middle school principals and teachers must be approved by the British before they can be appointed, and the same is true for primary schools. Textbooks are also subject to British interference. To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than the enslavement education policy implemented by the British. Therefore, overseas Chinese who are rich in patriotism, within the scope of economic possibility, would rather send their children to study in the country to avoid being anesthetized by the British education policy. I believe that Jinan University in Zhenru, Shanghai, was established to educate the children of overseas Chinese. The school authorities should earnestly teach and pay attention to the special education on how to develop the economy, career, and trade of overseas Chinese in Nanyang, in order to cultivate talents and cultivate new soldiers of overseas Chinese merchants, so that what they have learned can be used, so as not to disappoint the hopes of our overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have always been known for their ability to endure hardship and hard work, but there are also those who are addicted to smoking and gambling. Although the British authorities claim to prohibit it, in fact, they indulge in it in many ways. If the British authorities' tobacco tax revenue is used as a sacrifice, it will be clear. The most tobacco tax revenue was 31 million per year. In 1931, it was reduced to 6 million, and in the previous year, it increased to 8 million. In 1933, registration was once started, and the number of smokers reached 59,000. This year, the registration has been reduced to more than 26,400. On the surface, it seems to have been reduced by half, but according to those familiar with the situation, the number of smokers is more than 100,000.</p>
<p>Singapore is the British military base in the Pacific. The Second World War is about to break out. All countries are engaged in the expansion of armaments. The British have built a large naval port in Singapore, and foreigners are not allowed to enter. There is also a large-scale airport, which is also under construction. The British barracks are stationed in dense forests, and the preparation for defense is strict.</p>

<h3 id="e238">The Zhong Kui of the Japanese Dragon Boat Festival <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival is a solar term in the Chinese lunar calendar, but it has also been copied by Japan and changed to May 5th in the Gregorian calendar. After Japan abolished the Chinese lunar calendar, it followed the lunar calendar for all solar terms. Therefore, it is difficult to taste the loquat, which is necessary for the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival, in the Gregorian calendar. The Japanese do not have any activities during the Dragon Boat Festival. What they value most are temple fair days and various national memorial days.</p>
<p>In May, the Japanese hang cloth carp and windmills on bamboo poles, I don't know what it means. The carp is empty, and the wind enters the belly from the fish's mouth, and the belly swells up. Fluttering in the wind, it looks like jumping and swimming. Around May, the sky is the world of kites, mid-May is the world of carp, and after June, it is time to watch the Japanese fireworks.</p>
<p>The Japanese call clay dolls and foreign dolls as "human figures". What is popular in May is "warrior dolls". There are portraits of their Emperor Jinmu, wearing embroidered robes, black court boots, five strands of long beard, and unshaven hair. Some have two tufts on the left and right, and some tie their hair on top, completely in the style of ancient Chinese people. And with feathers inserted in the back, and a Japanese sword at the waist, it is even more the style of an ancient general. However, the left hand holds a long staff, with an old eagle coiled on top. On the right side of Emperor Jinmu, there must be a portrait of Zhong Kui, who is also worshiped by the Japanese. Unexpectedly, Zhong Kui, who is unattended to during the Dragon Boat Festival in our country, is very popular in Japan, and Sino-Japanese friendship is officially implemented.</p>
<p>When Zhong Jinshi went to Japan, it is probably not easy to investigate. Moreover, the face of Heitan Tuan has turned into a purplish brown color in Japan. But he still wears a pointed gauze hat on his head, and wears an embroidered python robe, not a red robe, like their Emperor Jinmu. His face is full of beard, and he holds a long sword, which is very majestic. Behind the two human figures, there is a row of shelves with knives, guns, and flags, and their portraits are also painted on the flags. In addition, there are bronze drums, bows, arrows, and various decorations. In front of the human figure, there is a set of Japanese armor, sitting on the animal skin, like our country's tiger skin treasure seat. The full set of human figures costs more than 30 yuan, and it may be difficult to buy unless they are from the upper middle class.</p>
<p>Around the time of the Dragon Boat Festival, Zhong Kui's vertical scroll will be hung in the living room. It is completely painted like a human figure, and it is not a black face. There are no bats and five ghosts next to it, it is extremely cold. When talking to the Japanese about Zhong Jinshi, they have seen him in Japan since they were young, and they no longer know that he is Chinese. Even our Chinese students, when they see this red-faced human figure, will not recognize that it is Zhong Jinshi, a pure domestic product of our country.</p>
<p>On the Dragon Boat Festival, reed leaves and mugwort are hung on the door. Several herbs are also put in the water in the bathhouse, which is the same as in our country. The fruit shop sells slender pen zongzi, just like in the country. Maybe there are many similar customs in the hometown.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Unofficial Biography of Master Wang <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Jiu</p>
<p>Master Wang was a Xiucai during the Qing Dynasty and had sat for the provincial exams, and had been recommended for his papers. Master Wang was a landlord in his village, owning hundreds of acres of land. In the eyes of the villagers, Master Wang was a remarkable figure because he had studied the books of sages.</p>
<p>There was a teahouse in the town, which was Master Wang's office. He occupied a table alone all day long, sitting there and talking loudly: either saying that the donations and taxes were too harsh, or saying that people's hearts were not as good as before. He splattered saliva and spat phlegm everywhere. He yearned for the prosperity of the Tang, Yu, and Xia Dynasties. He hated the transformation of Xia by using barbarians. He had no hobbies and liked to smoke pi si but hated cigarettes. He scolded foreign goods, even though the teapot had been changed to a thermos bottle and the nail boots had been changed to rubber galoshes. Master Wang had a high reputation in the village, so everyone looked up to him. He would settle family disputes and money disputes. His words were more effective than the judgments in the court because he could, based on the classics of sages and the laws of the Qing Dynasty, make people dare not disobey him. He could also write lawsuits for others, and the reward was determined according to the size of the matter, although he could not be said to be a litigation broker.</p>
<p>Master Wang's treatment of people was very measured: he had one kind of expression for the tax collection committee members, another kind of face for the village police or village chiefs, and another kind of demeanor for tenant farmers and those who asked him for help. Master Wang walked in a very steady manner, quite like the style of an official in the Qing Dynasty; therefore, when the children in the village jumped around, their parents would reprimand them, "You have to learn from Master Wang!" Master Wang often took a small boat to the city. This was not because the steamer used barbarians to change Xia, but because the boat was cheaper; and when he walked into the boat, who would dare not give up a seat and respect him with a "Master".</p>
<p>Comment: "Master Wang, things are rare; although not expensive, enough to sigh"!</p>

<h3 id="e240">Two Red Peaches (Part 2) <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Here, I have to add a sentence; I wrote about composing lectures late at night, teaching and attending classes during the day, and other detailed matters before the onset of the disease. Isn't it too cumbersome? Actually, it is not. These trivial matters are often related to the occurrence of the disease and the degree of severity after it occurs. The occurrence of a disease must have its cause and effect. The so-called cause is the cause of the disease. In general, the causes of diseases are nothing more than: one is the cause of the disease itself, and the other is the cause of the human body environment. We can call this environmental cause its inducing cause. For example, dysentery and typhoid fever, their cause is dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria; but just relying on typhoid and dysentery bacteria is often not necessarily able to make everyone who has eaten it get sick, it must also have the help of the second environmental cause to be reliable. For example, sometimes after eating at the same table, someone develops dysentery and typhoid fever, and the rest are fine. What's the reason? I think: perhaps it is because the person who developed the disease had an inducing environmental cause, such as indigestion, lack of stomach acid, or inflammation of the stomach and intestines. These are all inducing causes. So once you eat typhoid bacteria and dysentery bacteria, you will develop typhoid fever and dysentery. What about the rest? Although they may have also eaten pathogens (bacteria), they do not develop the disease because there is no second inducing cause. Just like my attack of tonsillitis, if I hadn't stayed up late to compose lectures that night, and I wouldn't have had to force myself to attend classes the next day, this problem wouldn't have occurred. I dare not say that; but the time of occurrence and the severity of the disease might have been lighter, the time might have been shortened a little, and the body temperature might not have been so high. These are all very possible. But my attack of pure "red peaches" was really quite serious, and the time was quite long, so when I wrote the process, I also wrote some minor things that happened before the disease and had a causal relationship with the disease itself.</p>
<p>Perhaps someone will ask: You are a doctor yourself, a little tonsillitis, which is not a big disease, how can you let it develop so severely? Don't you use medicine, don't you treat it?</p>
<p>Medicine, how can I not use medicine and not treat it!</p>
<p>Speaking of diagnosing and treating diseases, I have to take the opportunity to talk about the psychological concepts of ordinary people and us doctors, what are the differences in medicine.</p>
<p>Indeed, our doctors' psychology for diagnosing diseases and our concepts for medicine are quite different from those of ordinary people: ordinary people's concepts for diagnosing diseases always think that doctors can see clearly at a glance, and after one examination, they can give an accurate diagnosis of what disease it is. Doctors' skills surpass Zhang Tianshi, and doctors' eyes are microscopes! As for medication, needless to say what medicine to use for what disease, it is only right and proper that it is not a cure, but it must reduce the disease after taking the medicine. Conversely, doctors' diagnosis of diseases and use of medicines are not so simple. There are certainly many diseases that are easily diagnosed and can be diagnosed and known what disease it is after one examination, and it is common; it is not uncommon to examine for ten or eight days, but the diagnosis is still vague and inexplicable. When it comes to medication, it is of course reasonable to only wait during the diagnostic period without special symptomatic drugs. Even after the diagnosis is clear and the condition is clear, it is often not necessary to use any drugs for treatment, and it is not unreasonable treatment. Because the treatment of diseases does not rely solely on drugs. When medicine is needed, the function of the medicine is seen after application. When medicine is not needed, it is not appropriate to use medicine: excessive use of drugs, or the skin may violate the sick body. Although this is off topic, it may be a little helpful for people who do not understand the correct concept of medicine diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e241">School Health Education (Part 2) <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Shao Xiangyi’s lecture, Li Lingdong’s notes</p>
<p>2. Adapt to circumstances can be divided into age differences and environmental differences. Because of different ages, the needs are also different. The psychological needs of five- or six-year-old children and thirteen- or fourteen-year-old children are obviously different. For environmental differences, attention should be paid to the different grades of rich and poor, and the strength of economic ability, and appropriate guidance should be given. This is something that those who study health education must know.</p>
<p>3. Use examples for citation This is the most powerful, practical, and effective method. For example, citing the pain of XX being sick and the death of XX due to illness, in the minds of every child, witnessing the tragic situation and hearing the truth, there is an urgent anxiety of terror, so using examples for citation, supplemented by appropriate explanations, the effect will be great.</p>
<p>4. Proceed in an orderly manner There are different differences in the academic abilities of high-grade and low-grade children, so we must first impart basic hygiene knowledge, and then gradually deepen it. Otherwise, if high-grade children are taught at a low-grade level, it will make them lack interest in hygiene.</p>
<p>5. It must be related to social problems Generally, people think that hygiene is a personal matter. This idea is really wrong, because individuals cannot be independent from society. If the public does not pay attention to hygiene, even if individuals can pay attention to hygiene, they will eventually suffer in an unhygienic environment. For example, poor tap water equipment can spread diseases through drinking water. It can be seen that paying attention to hygiene, in addition to personal attention, must also pay attention to public health undertakings related to individuals.</p>
<p>III Methods of Implementing Health Education</p>
<p>1. Performance Select stimulating scripts and movies containing health education, so that children can learn lessons and know the effects.</p>
<p>2. Storytelling Select various stories related to hygiene, so that children can learn to have aspirations and imitate them through admiration and worship.</p>
<p>3. Chinese Painting Lanterns Collect and produce hygiene drawings and lanterns, and post them in the passages of the school. The lanterns are shown, so that they can be eye-catching and stimulate children's attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>4. Text Use stimulating hygienic sentences and hygienic books and newspapers, arranged in various places in the school.</p>
<p>5. Talk Show Put forward opinions on health education and hygienic knowledge.</p>
<p>6. Competition Hold hygiene speech contests, hygiene drawing contests, hygiene performance contests, hygiene labor contests, hygiene stories, hygiene text various competitions, etc.</p>
<p>7. Visit Visit various medical institutions, health institutions, and institutions related to health undertakings.</p>
<p>8. Practice Practice various courses on the spot, so that theory and practice are equally important.</p>
<p>9. Exam</p>
<p>IV Content of Health Education Materials</p>
<p>1. Knowledge of anatomical life burying shall clarify the structure and function of each system and organ of the human body "skeleton", "muscle", "digestion", "circulation", "breathing", "excretion", and "sensation".</p>
<p>2. Knowledge of medicine and hygiene should include the causes, symptoms, and general treatment methods of various diseases, and the general knowledge of personal hygiene and public hygiene, such as the prevention of infectious diseases, the improvement of environmental hygiene, the general application of school hygiene, the attention to safety hygiene, and the rules of daily personal hygiene.</p>
<p>3. Knowledge of biology, chemistry and physics such as the physical and chemical phenomena of food digestion, as well as the origin of human beings, the law of heredity, etc. (End)</p>

<p>— Newspaper Reports Slightly Differ</p>
<p>Since Mr. Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, gave a speech at the Prophylactic Venereology Conference initiated by the Chinese Medical Association, various newspapers have published reports of Mr. Li's speech, stating that 30% of the students in a certain girls' middle school in Shanghai were suffering from syphilis. The Chinese Medical Association points out that this record is slightly different from Mr. Li's original speech in order to avoid misunderstandings? The association hereby publishes the original text of Mr. Li's speech as follows: "Mr. Li said that to the best of his knowledge, a certain girls' school in Shanghai once recruited new students. A total of fifty-two people applied, and eighteen were admitted after the examination. Among these eighteen people, after performing the Wassermann blood test, four tested positive for syphilis, accounting for more than 22% of the total. This situation is indeed occasional. However, the age of the applicants at that time was older than usual, and many were already married, so it cannot be compared with other girls' schools."</p>

<p>Uncaria rhynchophylla, Matsum.</p>
<p>(Plant) Naturally grows in warm regions, a deciduous vine. Two hooked spines grow from the leaf axils to climb on other objects. Leaves are opposite, petiolate, oblong-ovate, acuminate, and white on the reverse side. Small yellow funnel-shaped flowers bloom in summer. The fruit is broadly elliptical.</p>
<p>(Crude Drug) Uncaria hooks, the Rhynchophylla, are collected from its hooks and the connecting stem. The hooks are roughly opposite along the main axis, usually in the shape of a developed fishhook, the large ones being 1 cm and the width 8 mm. The surface is reddish-brown or dark brown, and the texture is hard. The taste is bitter, with astringency.</p>
<p>(Ingredients) The leaves and hooks contain Rhynchophylline, a crystalline alkaloid. Its molecular formula is C22H28N2O4 or C21H26N2O4.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) A small amount of Rhynchophylline can stimulate the respiratory center, and it has the same effect on the internal organs of frogs as Digitalis. Blood pressure is significantly reduced by Rhynchophylline, and peripheral blood vessels dilate. Intravenous injection in rabbits shows obvious dyspnea and motor paralysis as general symptoms. If the lethal dose is reached, death occurs due to respiratory paralysis. The minimum lethal dose for a rabbit weighing 1,000 grams is 35-40 mg by intravenous injection, and 0.03 grams by subcutaneous injection, which only shows signs of rapid breathing.</p>
<p>(Medicinal Use) According to ancient texts, Uncaria hooks can treat infantile convulsions, headaches, and dizziness in adults, and can be used as a sedative.</p>
<p>Example prescription: Gouteng San, effective for treating infantile nocturnal crying and so-called epilepsy. Uncaria hooks, Chuan Xiong, Cicada slough, Licorice, Paeoniae Radix Alba. The above five flavors are taken internally as a decoction.</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 155) How should we pay attention to our lives?</p>
<p>Answer: The lives of urban people today cannot be as natural and simple as those of the ancients or rural people. All the troubles of human affairs, the temptation of profit, and the erosion of thoughts all have the possibility of weakening our nerves and reducing our health. Dental diseases are particularly common in civilized society, which is not accidental. To achieve the goal of prevention, we must keep our health above the average level and actively improve our daily lives. First, we should prevent and avoid overwork of the body and mind, and always keep our spirits and physical strength abundant. To achieve this, we must avoid irregular life, and both work and rest should be scheduled. All improper entertainment, indulgence, insomnia, starvation, etc., should be strictly prohibited. Second, we should preserve our digestive power and avoid overeating. Each meal should be scheduled, and we should chew slowly and deliberately, without rushing. Third, we should handle everything with an optimistic attitude. Fourth, we should quit smoking and drinking to avoid harming the stomach and brain. Fifth, we should strive for appropriate exercise to achieve physical and mental strength and comfort. Sixth, we should find ways to get more sunlight and fresh air. Sunlight can increase vitamins in the body, which is beneficial to teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 156) Why should we prevent the invasion of diseases?</p>
<p>Answer: All diseases can reduce the body's resistance and indirectly induce dental diseases. Neurasthenia, lung disease, typhoid fever, diabetes, venereal diseases, etc., are easily caused by tooth decay or pyorrhea. We should usually prevent the invasion of diseases. If we unfortunately get a disease, we should treat it quickly and never delay it, so as not to affect the teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 157) Can oral medications damage teeth?</p>
<p>Answer: Many people have tooth problems because they think they have taken too much medicine. In fact, it is not like that. However, oral medications containing mercury, lead, potassium, iodine, iron, etc., often induce stomatitis and periodontitis when taken in large doses, so special attention should be paid.</p>
<p>(Question 158) What else should we pay attention to?</p>
<p>Answer: Local protection of teeth is also very important. Do not let them be hit, and do not use them to bite ropes or hard objects, because if the teeth have cracks, they are easy to decay.</p>
<h3 id="e246">A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (93) <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Everyone knows the importance of air to people; its achievements in the treatment of this disease have been detailed in the previous chapter. However, it is better to prevent the occurrence of this disease with air, rather than relying on air to treat it. This is a "taking it one step further" approach that everyone should be determined to follow! Speaking of its method, it is very simple, that is, one must spend a long time in fresh air every day. The so-called fresh air refers to places with less dust and coal smoke, and more trees. This is a bit more difficult for people living in cities, but you may as well linger in suburban parks and other places. Even taking a step back, although the air outdoors is not necessarily fresh, it is far better than indoors no matter what; of course, this can be enjoyed every day without any cost!</p>
<p>Sunlight is a major enemy of tubercle bacilli, as detailed above; but its contribution to this disease is by no means limited to this point. It can stimulate body cells, so that physiological functions are enhanced, and indirectly can increase the body's resistance to tubercle bacilli. Usually, glandular tuberculosis and bone tuberculosis, which are easily contracted by children, can sometimes be cured with just sunlight therapy. If we stay in fresh air and are also exposed to sunlight, the increase in the body's resistance will definitely be more significant without a doubt.</p>
<p>There are many people who are prone to catching colds if they stay in fresh air for too long; this is especially true for Chinese people, and it is even completely psychological, resulting in suspicion. This is a great misfortune, and to remedy this deficiency, we can only start with strengthening the skin. The method is: develop the habit of staying outdoors more often, rub the skin with cold water (attached to washing the face and bathing), do not wear too warm clothes, do not keep the bedroom too warm, the room should be open windows, and you should also keep the habit of opening windows when sleeping; all these should be started from childhood, so that they will become a complete habit in the future, and there is no need to worry about it.</p>
<p>Is the nutrition of people's bodies good or bad? It has a great relationship with the prevention of infection. Therefore, to increase the resistance of human tissue, it is necessary to fully supply the raw materials of human vitality, the so-called raw materials, that is, nutritious food. Pulmonary tuberculosis is no exception. Regarding its occurrence, it is sometimes entirely due to malnutrition, so people, in addition to sunlight and air, must not lack one of the three required nutrients: protein, fat, and carbohydrates, and they must be appropriately proportioned. Animal meat and fresh vegetables in terms of food should be included, and milk and eggs, which are rich in nutrition, should also be frequently visited. Here the author has to explain one thing. That is, recently some people have greatly promoted the theory of vegetarian hygiene, and this kind of argument has gained the blind following of many people, and even a foreign doctor has written an article holding this view; this is completely wrong. Taking pulmonary tuberculosis as an example, the protein of its animals is particularly important and cannot be easily lacked. If it is said that meat eaters are prone to suffering from tumors, liver diseases, and hardening of blood vessels due to the necessary materials and toxins in animals; then we might as well say that the causes of common intestinal parasites and dysentery are roughly inseparable from eating vegetables and fruits; but we must never advocate banning vegetarian food, because this is completely "throwing the baby out with the bathwater"; then, the so-called vegetarian hygiene theory, its different value can also be imagined! Therefore, the food that people need, both animal meat and vegetables should be equally emphasized, and mixed (of course, patients with this disease are included), and should not be misled by seemingly correct arguments.</p>
<p>There are many diseases that are very likely to induce pulmonary tuberculosis; therefore, in order to prevent the occurrence of this disease, we should also pay attention to the diseases that induce tuberculosis at the same time. In this respect, the respiratory system is second to none! Like tonsillitis, bronchitis, pertussis, measles, etc. in children, are the most obvious examples; if the occurrence of the above diseases can be prevented, indirectly it can be said that it is adding a layer of defense work to pulmonary tuberculosis! In addition, if there are influenza, pleurisy, swollen lymph glands, hemorrhoids, and anemia, menstrual disorders, indigestion, and other conditions, it is very easy to induce this disease, and of course, strict attention must also be paid to it.</p>

<h3 id="e247">What Should We Give Them? <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Xijian</p>
<p>Report: "...Overseas Chinese, concerned about the motherland, have successively organized inspection groups to return to the country for sightseeing. Those who have come to Shanghai include the Philippine Chinese Inspection Group, the Siamese Tourist Group, and the Javanese Surabaya Chinese Tourist Group... According to information from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Department, the Java Samborondang is also organizing a tourist group, with dozens of people, all of whom have lived overseas for several generations and have never set foot on their national soil..."</p>
<p>At this time of national crisis, when the country is precarious, it is a gratifying thing that some overseas Chinese can successively organize inspection groups and tourist groups to visit this ancient motherland. It is like an old man in his twilight years being able to see his long-lost son returning home. The inner joy is truly indescribable.</p>
<p>Because of the weakness of the country, overseas Chinese are being bullied, expelled, and slaughtered everywhere. However, can the ancient motherland give them a little protection and comfort besides expressing sadness? Now they are visiting the motherland with such enthusiasm, but what can this vast motherland give them! Half of the country has changed color, the enemy is flexing its muscles, and there are scars everywhere, all of which make them disappointed. Besides showing them the tall buildings, modern cars in the city, and some mountains and rivers that have not been plundered, what can be offered to them? At the same time, behind this prosperous city and famous mountains and rivers, there are infinite tragedies, bankruptcies, decline, and human tragedies hidden! They are exploited abroad, living an inhuman life, and it is so disappointing to return to their homeland, how sad should it be?</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have contributed to the motherland. When Mr. Sun Yat-sen made the revolution, he received a lot of assistance from them. During the heroic resistance against the enemy on January 28th, they also received spiritual and material help. Recently, they have also donated a lot of money to buy airplanes to "save the country through aviation." These are all blood and sweat money they have earned despite all kinds of oppression and insults overseas. But what do we give them? It only gives them a broken and declining impression to take back.</p>
<h3 id="e248">"Poison" and Others <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>First performance of the Experimental Small Theater</p>
<p>It was really endless joy. When I followed the crowded crowd out of the New Light Grand Theater, I was encouraged by this warm mood. On the way, the topics of conversation with friends could not help but focus on the experimental small theater itself and the three plays performed this time; when I now write to express some opinions, my enthusiasm is rekindled, as if I just stepped out of the theater.</p>
<p>In addition to the three plays performed this time, I originally wanted to say a little bit about my opinions on the small theater itself, such as the repertoire, the theater, etc., but due to the length of this article, I want to leave it to another opportunity to say, so I will not mention it here.</p>
<p>As for the three plays performed this time, I watched "The Proposal" from the upstairs hall. Because it was too far away, I couldn't see it clearly, so I don't want to talk about it. I had seen "Freedom" before, but it wasn't performed as well as this time, so I don't want to talk about it either. The reason is to economize space, and because the actors who performed it are all veterans of the stage, and also so-called movie stars, so I want to leave some space to talk more about the center of this performance, and the performance of "newcomers" in "Poison".</p>
<p>"Poison" has its shortcomings. I agree with the two points made by Mr. Chu Yun in his article talking about "Poison" (see the special issue of this newspaper on May 30), especially the first point. I think it is better to make the audience more angry at the traitors than to make the audience go back happy. In fact, what great benefit is there to the entire national crisis from killing such a small traitor, and after the righteous sister kills the traitor, will she be able to escape the enemy's control? Therefore, we should let the audience know that it is not enough to simply kill an enemy. We should "get to the bottom of the matter" and clearly identify who our current giant enemy is! How can we defeat our enemies?</p>
<p>However, in the current situation of script panic, such works that conform to the mainstream of national defense drama are still rare and valuable. The author has written down a naked portrait of the traitor for us, and also a portrait of a righteous and progressive woman seeking survival under heavy pressure. These two different characters are sent together, which makes us more sympathetic and hateful characters. Moreover, the author, Mr. Zhang Min, is an actual practitioner of the drama movement. Based on his rich experience, there are few wasteful or confusing places in the dialogue, and when the traitor is about to drink poison, the author cleverly uses the suspense that can best grab the audience's emotions, wanting to drink and then stopping, making the audience's emotions tense.</p>
<p>Although most of the actors are newcomers, they are very confident in their personalities. This is a general good feeling. Because they are confident in their personalities, they are very kind and real, as if the people of Northeast China are reporting their experiences to us; moreover, the makeup is very good, so we forget that they are actors performing on stage.</p>
<p>The acting skills of the actors are still lacking in experience because they are "newcomers", but their efforts and seriousness (to put it more appropriately, it can be said that they are empathetic) almost cover up this flaw, especially Shen Yi, who plays the younger sister, and Li Qing, who plays the older brother, are very able to show their stern, strong, and rude and vicious character.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan, Wang Weiyi, Zheng Junli, and Xu Tao played very unimportant soldiers, plainclothes teams, etc. here, washing away the bad habit of the self-proclaimed "stars" who are still amazing. This spirit is very worthy of our praise.</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The lighting and set design seem to be simple, although this may be mainly due to economic reasons. However, we think of the importance of lighting and set design in the entire play, and we hope that in the various plays that will be staged in the future, we can try to remedy it as much as possible.</p>
<p>We warmly hope that there will be even more satisfactory results next week!</p>
<h3 id="e249">The Qin Player <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Jun</p>
<p>On the last day of May, a new family moved in upstairs from us, right next door. There were three of them: a middle-aged man and two girls; the older one was about sixteen or seventeen, and the younger one looked no more than fifteen. They were dressed very flamboyantly, easily making people think they were "of easy virtue." (Note)</p>
<p>One evening, I was taking a walk on the Jin'gang Bridge when I happened to meet Section Chief Fan, who lived in the same alleyway, also watching the night boats on the river. He grabbed me, moved the pipe from his mouth, and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Do you know what the people next door to you do?"</p>
<p>"How would I know? But judging by appearances, they don't seem like upright people!"</p>
<p>"Let me tell you, I know all about them!" He tapped his pipe on the railing. "That man is a qin player, specifically involved in underhanded dealings. Both girls are his adopted daughters. He abducted the older one from Guanwai, and he got the younger one from a female opera singer, who bought her and gave her to him as a gift. He teaches the two girls to sing Beijing opera, and they're currently performing at the Zhonghua Tea House in the Japanese concession. I often hear them sing there. Last week, I even requested the older girl to sing 'Yu Tang Chun'! Ah, she sings it well! The rhythm is perfect, every beat is precise, clear and crisp, practically no less skilled than Mei Lanfang. If you heard her, your bones would melt! Haha..."</p>
<p>After hearing this, I didn't say a word, staring blankly at the faint shadow of the bridge on the water. A sense of oppression filled my heart, until Section Chief Fan, squeezing his throat, hummed softly, "Chong Laobo says he is wrongly accused and can't defend himself..." and walked across the bridge. Only then did I subconsciously move my feet and slowly saunter back to my dwelling.</p>
<p>It was already past midnight when I went to sleep. Loneliness began to embrace the night. I quietly fell asleep. Not long after, a sound on the stairs startled me awake! The door next door opened; they had returned.</p>
<p>"Dad, you forgot to bring back the erhu."</p>
<p>"You're deliberately trying to cause me trouble! I've suffered and toiled to raise you two, hoping you'd earn enough to feed me in my old age. Who knew you'd want to fly away before your wings were even strong enough! You're delusional! As long as I'm alive, you won't get away with it!"</p>
<p>Then came a burst of sobbing, painfully assailing my heart. I quietly peeked through the crack in the board wall. The man was viciously pinching the older girl's legs and waist, holding scissors in his other hand. I saw the girl kneeling on the ground, tears streaming down her face, begging for mercy. The man's eyes were like a ferocious beast's, the scissors pointed at her chest, as if to say, if you scream, I'll stab you to death! The younger girl was also kneeling beside her, her face covered in blood and tears.</p>
<p>What a cruel and terrifying thing! My heart trembled. I almost cried out. After I lay back in bed, my clothes were soaked with sweat. I felt the cruelty and horror of this world!</p>
<p>"Damn it! You won't know what's what unless I give you some pain!"</p>
<p>"Dad, I... I won't dare again..."</p>
<p>"Who doesn't know that Chen Erye is willing to spend money? He spends thousands upon thousands every year. Any girl he takes a fancy to gets rich and becomes lucky. Others burn incense and pray, hoping for it, but you refuse him, and instead you fool around with that little good-for-nothing, Xiao Lengzi! (Note) If you don't bring Chen Erye back tomorrow, I'll skin you alive!"</p>
<p>People thrown into the filth of life, trampled upon, insulted, harmed, forever sinking into the abyss of pain, bearing the heavy wounds of hunger, without protest, without struggle, their fate destroyed in the darkness! How pitiful they are! I fear that one day they will be murdered!</p>
<p>Not long after they went to sleep, the girl emitted an unbearable moan of pain, clearly being trampled upon by intense, unrestrained bestiality!</p>
<p>Lost in painful thoughts all night, I was furious! I wanted to shout, but I finally endured it.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the two girls got up and tuned their voices on the platform, their shrill, delicate voices rising and falling, the mournful, resentful tones constantly squeezed from their vocal cords. As the bells of the Hedong Church chimed, the sun was already high in the sky. The qin player got up to wash and rinse his mouth, and only then did they stop tuning their voices and go inside to serve him breakfast. Afterwards, the qin player picked up his old bass erhu, and the two girls took turns practicing singing, over and over. When they missed a beat, the qin player would scold, "What are you thinking about again! You worthless thing!" Naturally, they had to sing again. When they sang to the part "Going out to hunt..." he paced back and forth, scolding, "Damn it! I've told you so many times, that 'hunt' character should be sung lower and lower, until the last note rises, and then you start singing again! And so, the second time, the first time, the..."</p>
<p>After lunch, they dressed neatly and followed him out, not returning until after midnight. Almost every night, I heard the girls' crying and moaning.</p>
<p>Every morning, Section Chief Fan would run up to the third floor to stroll around. When he saw me, he would always say, "The air up here is very good. It's good to exercise here." I knew his "heart wasn't in what he was doing," so I just casually hummed and hawed. Several times I saw him talking to the older girl in secret, when the qin player was still asleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one night, the qin player brought the younger girl back alone, and started hitting her as soon as they entered the door. She cried and screamed, and he kept hitting her while forcing her to ask:</p>
<p>"Tell me the truth, where did your sister go? If you don't tell me, I'll kill you!"</p>
<p>"After singing 'Fenhe Bay', she went out, I... don't know..."</p>
<p>He beat the girl half to death, then went out and called the police, who took the girl away. This time I saw the girl's tear-stained, bloodless face.</p>
<p>The next day, Section Chief Fan was gone. I was very suspicious. Later, I asked the teahouse attendant, who said that Section Chief Fan's name was Fan Lengyun, and everyone called him Xiao Lengzi. Only then did I realize that the older girl had eloped with Section Chief Fan.</p>
<p>After living there for a week, the teahouse attendant came to tell me:</p>
<p>"The little girl next door died in the Public Security Bureau."</p>
<p>Note 1: "Of easy virtue" refers to prostitutes. Note 2: "Da mi" means "honey."</p>
<h3 id="e250">Life and Death <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Chang Feng</p>
<p>A'cui's due date was approaching, and Zhang, the landlord, had specially sent a sedan chair to welcome her mother to the city. The old woman had just returned from the fields after bringing her husband his meal. From afar, she saw the sedan chair in front of her house, the two sedan carriers fanning their chests with large coolie hats under the tree. The old woman was most afraid of seeing that sedan chair. She would always remember that her daughter A'cui had been carried away in that sedan chair and sent into the mouth of a tiger. Now, it had been over a year, and she had gone to the city twice but had not seen her daughter once. Last year, her husband had gone to the granary to pay rent, and only after begging and pleading did Master Zhang hear his daughter call out "Father" once.</p>
<p>Thinking of A'cui, the old woman's legs felt weak and she couldn't move. The lunch basket in her hand gradually became heavier. Although she thought of detouring back to her own back door from the other side of the field bank, her trembling appearance had already been noticed by the sedan carriers. They ran up from afar, took the lunch basket from her hand, and called her "Old Madam," saying, "Our master is taking Madam to the city. The sedan chair is waiting at the door."</p>
<p>The old woman opened her dazed eyes and looked at the people who came. She had never dreamed that a small-footed old woman would have a day to be called "Madam." But she was not allowed to consider, and the two sedan carriers had already taken her away, carrying her away like her daughter A'cui had been snatched into the sedan chair, flying away.</p>
<p>The old woman felt dizzy and confused, as if she were haunted by ghosts. She didn't know what dangerous things she was about to encounter. She also seemed to recall many things, but those things did not take root in her mind, rising and falling like bubbles. It was only when the sedan chair entered the bustling city that she struggled to shout out:</p>
<p>"Hey! Where are you taking me?"</p>
<p>The sedan carrier in front turned his head and glanced at her, slowing down a little and answering:</p>
<p>"The young mistress is about to give birth, and we are taking Madam to help."</p>
<p>The sedan chair stopped right in front of Zhang, the landlord's house. When the old woman recognized that it was the tiger's mouth—the screen wall painted with the Taiji diagram, the two black lacquered wall doors—she finally understood. Could it be that A'cui was giving birth? This was good news, and her husband would be happy to know. So she subconsciously looked back, but her husband was not following behind. Behind her were the sedan carriers who had hurriedly carried her here.</p>
<p>Two maids helped her enter the door. Having farmed Zhang the landlord's land for over ten years, this was the first time she had entered through the main gate. The high hall, the courtyard, the corridors, all dazzled the old woman's eyes. Now, the hatred she felt for Zhang the landlord had changed: he had not mistreated her daughter A'cui. Zhang the landlord had no sons. If her daughter gave birth to a boy, she would enjoy endless blessings for the rest of her life. Hadn't she already been called "Old Madam"? In that case, her husband would be "Old Master." May Heaven bless them so that they would turn their lives around from farming.</p>
<p>When she reached the earthen room, Zhang the landlord invited her to sit down. The old woman couldn't think of a title to address Zhang the landlord. The words "son-in-law" had already reached her lips, but she didn't dare to say them. She stared at the two-stroke mustache on her son-in-law's lips, and after a long time, she asked vaguely:</p>
<p>"How is A'cui?"</p>
<p>Zhang the landlord was smoking a cigar, as if he hadn't heard her question. After the maid brought tea, he looked at the inner room and said:</p>
<p>"A'cui is about to give birth. If she gives birth to a boy, your good fortune will be great!" Zhang the landlord smiled slightly. He was already over fifty years old and had married five concubines but had not had a child. It was the year before last that the old woman's husband owed rent, and the bailiff, wanting to make extra money, exaggerated and snatched A'cui to be Zhang the landlord's sixth concubine. The landlord did not stay in A'cui's room for two months before abandoning her. It was only when he found out that A'cui was pregnant that he became happy.</p>
<p>The old woman wanted to ask to go into the inner room to see her daughter, but her son-in-law only paced in the room, giving her no chance to speak.</p>
<p>The doctor came out, and Zhang the landlord immediately went up to ask what was wrong. The doctor's face was stiff and lifeless, and he leaned close to Zhang the landlord's ear and said in a low voice: "The young mistress is too young, and the fetus is too large. I'm afraid we'll have to perform surgery, but if we save the mother, we can't save the child, and if we save the child, we can't save the mother."</p>
<p>"Is it, is it impossible to have both?" Zhang the landlord frowned.</p>
<p>The doctor shook his head: "It seems there is no way!"</p>
<p>"Then, save the child!" He decided decisively.</p>
<p>The old woman jumped up suddenly when she heard this. She grabbed the doctor's hand: "Doctor, that won't do! That won't do! Save the mother; my A'cui." She looked at Zhang the landlord: "Landlord Zhang, I beg you, save A'cui! She can have children again. I only have this one daughter. Save the mother!"</p>
<p>A tragic cry came from the inner room. The doctor twisted the old woman's hand, raising his eyebrows to seek Zhang the landlord's consent. Zhang the landlord lowered his head. The doctor immediately went into the inner room, and the door was tightly closed again.</p>
<p>The old woman knelt down in front of Zhang the landlord. She could only shout to save the mother! Save the mother!</p>
<h3 id="e251">Unfinished Writing <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Feng</p>
<p>Not particularly short, his facial profile resembled that of Barbusse. I don't know if his real name was Feng Qiangzhi, because I sometimes saw him receive letters with different names, and some friends often called him Old Jiang.</p>
<p>Because he resembled Barbusse a bit, he often seemed quite pleased with himself, showing others his unwritten manuscripts, although his great work was always an "unfinished masterpiece." He said, "Look, I'm about to finish it. It's a novel, very influenced by Gorky." The next day, he might change his tune: "I'm not writing that novel anymore. I'm going to write poetry, really. I've been reading a lot of poetry recently, and my own poetic inspiration has been ignited. I want to use my burning, passionate pen to write down the stories of national heroes and turn them into a great epic poem." Judging by his tone, it was as if he was already standing among millions of readers, receiving their adoration. He lived happily like this every day, in his "unfinished masterpiece," laughing with his low nasal voice.</p>
<p>His friends all adopted an indifferent attitude toward him. "What will he ever accomplish?" That's what everyone thought. Just look at his past actions; he didn't seem like someone who could get anything done. Sometimes I also stood on the same side as my friends, directing cold sarcasm at him, even saying with a mocking tone, "Hey, has your great work been published yet?" He would say with a forced smile, "It's not finished yet."</p>
<p>The one called Bin would interject, "It doesn't matter. I'll publish it for you, and all the money from the sales will be yours..."</p>
<p>"Don't joke around; I'm writing, I'm writing hard!" he would say, laughing with his low nasal voice. Then he would wave his hand at us and walk away with light steps. "Goodbye!" he would shout, waving his hand, as if very embarrassed.</p>
<p>I criticized Bin's words, because such an attitude was not suitable for Old Feng, because he was someone who often needed encouragement from others and was very ambitious. Words that hurt him too much would cause him to lose happy feelings for his friends or himself. For example, when he was writing an article, even if he often abandoned it before finishing, it was our responsibility to help him complete it, and not to determine that he would never write a work. However, Bin was someone who only knew how to joke around; he didn't pay much attention to other things. So he just smiled at my opinion. However, a bad phenomenon finally appeared in Old Feng's behavior. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— By Gu Wenzong</p>
<p>Dajun: Ah—may I ask your honorable surname?</p>
<p>Jinghong: My humble surname is Shen.</p>
<p>Dajun: Does Miss Shen have a name card with her? May I have the honor of receiving one?</p>
<p>Jinghong: Certainly. Then may I exchange one with you?</p>
<p>Dajun: That would be even better. (Sound of exchanging name cards, reading name card) Shen Jinghong, Wuxian County, Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Zhao Dajun, a native of Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, Republic of China—ah! Mr. Zhao is from my hometown?</p>
<p>Dajun: Yes, Miss Shen. Miss Shen's Mandarin is very standard!</p>
<p>Jinghong: Mr. Zhao, you are too kind. My speech is already close to distorted and impure Mandarin. How can it compare to Mr. Zhao's fluent and accurate Mandarin?</p>
<p>Dajun: You are too kind. Since I went to America, I have forgotten most of my Mandarin. I must be mispronouncing many words. Please, Miss Shen, give me some pointers.</p>
<p>Jinghong: There's no need to talk about that. Let's study together.</p>
<p>Liya: Hello, Miss Shen! You're hiding here by yourself? Good, I've been looking for you for a long time!</p>
<p>Jinghong: As soon as I got on the train, I sat here and didn't move. You were looking for me? How could I not know?</p>
<p>Liya: Let's not talk about that now. I'll ask you, have you eaten?</p>
<p>Jinghong: I have.</p>
<p>Liya: What did you eat?</p>
<p>Jinghong: I bought two pieces of bread and two pieces of beef. I hastily counted that as lunch.</p>
<p>Liya: Oh! How can you eat so little? And those things aren't very sanitary! Moreover, those things don't have much nutrition.</p>
<p>Jinghong: Then what kind of sanitary things did you eat?</p>
<p>Liya: I ordered a set meal. The food on this train is very good. I heard that the chef on this train used to be the chef at the British Embassy, so what he makes has a full British flavor. Moreover, it's cheaper than what you can buy at a big hotel, only one dollar per set meal. Why didn't you eat that?</p>

<p>Disliking the old and loving the new is indeed in line with the public's psychology. Knowing full well that something is still usable, but because it is old, it is discarded. Even if you spend money to buy something worse than the old thing, you are still happy with it. Why? Because it is new. Therefore, the value of everything is based on newness as the standard.</p>
<p>Zhang Ping is a practical demonstration of the above point. The boots on his feet are indeed old! But the boots are not damaged in any way. It's just that they have been bought for a long time, so he has the idea of disliking the old and loving the new in his heart. He asks his wife for ten dollars to go out and buy new boots. How could he know that after spending ten dollars and exchanging the boots three times, the result is still the original old boots? And he doesn't even know it, so he happily goes home, thinking that after spending ten dollars and exchanging the boots twice</p>
