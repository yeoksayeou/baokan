<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>（五）產業之振興及貿易之發展；五七</p>
<p>（一）電力之統制强化。　一</p>
<p>（二）液體燃料之自給。　二二</p>
<p>（三）鋼鐵之自給。　三</p>
<p>（四）纖維資源之確保。　二</p>
<p>（五）貿易之助長及統制。　一一</p>
<p>（六）航空事業之振興。　九</p>
<p>（七）海軍事業之振興。　一</p>
<p>（八）國民海外發展之助長。四</p>
<p>（六）對滿重要策之確立。　二五</p>
<p>在此項重要國策費（十億六千五百萬元）中，陸海軍兩省之國防充實經費，爲六億九千一百萬元約佔總額百分之六十五。稅制整備費二億三千七百萬元，佔百分之二十五。此外，國民生活安定費，產業振興費，貿易發展費，以及對滿重要策確立費，共一億三千五百萬元，只佔總額百分之十三。據此，則是所謂之重要國策，其實質也是偏於軍事方面的了。而且，由這些數字的具體說明，也可以知道廣田內閣高唱的庶政一新，骨子裏究竟是些甚麼東西？</p>
<p>（三）大陸政策之強化</p>
<p>一九三〇年時，日本的軍事費，不過四億四千二百萬元，在當時的預算額中，只佔百分之二十八，現在的軍事費，已超出三倍以上。軍事費增加之內容，陸軍方面主要是的：一、航空兵力之增强。二、在滿兵備之充實。三、改善兵備。海軍方面主要的是：一、艦艇製造費。二、航空兵力之擴充。三、水陸戰事整備費。</p>
<p>這樣海陸軍備的擴充，依據日本現下之情勢，自然是很必要。只不過日本的軍備擴充了一分，中國的問題也就餒重了一分。日本方面所謂的國防，質言之，卽是求大陸政策之實現。「欲征服亞洲，必先征服中國。欲征服中國，必先征服滿蒙」。這田中的名言，卽是大陸政策之主要骨幹。現在滿洲已經脫離中國了，內蒙也在防共的名義下，組織政府，進攻綏遠。滿蒙的合作，據十二月六日僞滿的聲明，已爲必然之事。這種種行動，都是以大陸政策之理論爲根據的。若大陸政策更加强化，則亞洲風雲必更發生變化吧！</p>
<p>（四）增稅和增發公債</p>
<p>支持日本這個龐大預算案的中要經費來源，是大衆增稅和增發公債。一九三七年度的日本租稅收入，預算爲十四億二千四百萬元。較之一九三六年，增加了五億一百萬元。在各種增稅中，所得稅增加最多，從二億三千一百萬元，增加到五億二千五百萬元，共增加了二億九千四百萬元。此外，除一般的加稅外，更新設了許多從前未有的稅制，如財產稅，外貨價特別稅，揮發油稅，賣上稅，外國貿易統計稅和輸入統制稅等。這些新稅收入，每年約七千七百萬元。他如烟草，郵便之增價，郵貯利下等，每年增收也約在千二百萬元左右。這些增稅案，雖然現在下層民間有反抗的呼聲，但結果，一定是要實行的。</p>
<p>與增稅相伴的，是增發公債。一九三七年度的日本公債，發行額預定爲九億六千一百萬元。此種增稅與增發公債之財政方針，對於日本將來之財政，究能發生如何影響？馬塲藏相在預算閣議席上曾經說過：「以後之公債政策，在今後之五年中，亦當確守十億元之限度。且增稅亦非絕對之方針」。又說：「五年以後之公債，當可漸减，可由十億元减至八億元或七億元」</p>

<p>留居西安之蔣委員長。已於昨日下午安然離陝抵洛本報接得洛陽急電。立卽刋發號外。頒布全市市。民於樂聞之餘。爭鳴爆竹。以示歡欣。其熱烈鼓舞之情况。實國難以來所僅見。由此足徵一般國民對於國車關懷之殷切。與夫擁謹領袖忠忱之眞摯。任何方面不能予以否認者也。</p>
<p>自西安事變發生迄今。爲期已屆兩週。凡屬略具頭腦之羣衆。無不致其深切之憂灼。而蔣委員長之安全問題。尤爲中外一致所縈念。地勿論都會與鄉鄙。士勿。論睿愚賢不肖。殆莫不以此爲討論之焦點。誠以國勢常如斯緊急之關頭。蔣氏爲對外負責之領袖。何堪一日失其自由。致使全局同受震盪。今幸此舉國仰望之領袖。已能安然離陝。飛抵洛陽。其足以療人飢渴。自無待言。而幾瀕隳壞之統一局面。得以重歸完整。半月來籠罩人人心頭之愁雲疑霧。一旦趨於渙散。尤足爲國運前途之慶幸。固非僅個入險夷之轉捩而已。</p>
<p>蔣氏離陝之經過。雖尙未得其詳情。要爲出於民意之匡護。固宜有其相當之成分。蓋自蔣被刦持以來。全國舆論。責難備至。討逆函電。星流電馳。雖在異國人士。亦復深致惋惜。其給予西安之印象。實甚於劇烈之轟炸。無論如何恣睢之人物。在此扞格環境之下。應有不能自壯其氣者而入民意志力量之表現。亦自有其不可輕侮者矣。</p>
<p>吾人於遙祝蔣委員長康勝之餘。極盼其能早日命斾返京。主持中樞政務。藉慰人民喁喁之望。在此萬衆騰歡聲中。蔣氏所體及者。應亦深鐫於中。經此波折以後。吾人預卜蔣氏必能本其堅毅之精神。益圖發揮而光大。以紓當前之困厄。以奠國某於永固。以不負全國一片擁戴領袖之眞忱。吾人在歡迎蔣委員畏出險之今日。對國是前途。更具有無限殷切之熱望焉。</p>

<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>一·各人的看法不同</p>
<p>聽說此次考試院院長戴季陶先生在德時對於德國現狀曾作過一度實地的考察，參觀了不少城市。有一决旅行到某城時，該城市長幷國社黨部照例以上賓之禮設宴歡迎戴先生，席間戴先生起立演說，大的一半爲了外交上的禮貌，一半也因爲年來德國所建設的成績，有許多地方的確値得外賓的欽佩，（特別是國防計劃）於是乎自然難免要說幾句護美德國的話，不料第二天，德報的記載中間有這麽一段「（戴先生設）你們德國人給了我們一個模範，我們中國人是十分感激的，……我們的領袖蔣介石先生，正在效法你們的領袖希特勒先生……」。</p>
<p>記得一位學丁科的中國同學，平常是一位不容易發脾氣的好先生，忽然有一天同一德國人發生了小衝突，終於爭論到臉紅耳赤，事後他吿訴記者，「你瞧，這不是豈有此理嗎，剛才那位德國舉生居然對我說，中國所差的就是一位希特勒，說是咱們的蔣介石應該學學他們的領袖希特勒才行，事實上，咱們蔣介石的才榦不知道要比他們的希特勒高明過多少倍。中國的事悄有多少難辦，讓希特勒來試試看，這簡直對於咱們是一種侮辱，咱們的蔣介石應該學學他們的希特勒。」</p>
<p>自然，各人的看法不同。</p>
<p>二·誰是中國現代最大的外交家</p>
<p>「弱國無外交」，可是一位專攻國際政治的朋友却把「誰是中國現代最大的外交家」這個問　來爲難我。我說：「朋友，一部中國現代的外交史是一部國難史，我們雖不願意以成收論英雄，但是！」</p>
<p>他吿訴我：「假如我想在中國外交史上或者在外交界中去找尋出這麽一個人物來，那末，我的時間才算花得寃枉。」我說：「要在外交史幷外交界以外」，他的回答。</p>
<p>據我看來，中國現代只有兩位最大的外交家，難說他們不是外交官，但可惜他們都死了，孫中山先生與胡漢民先生。孫先生過日時，日本人請他演講大亞洲主義，他沒有忘記他是一個中國人，他吿訴了日本的　衆，大亞洲主義的前提，在於日本要跟歐洲歐化呢，還是回到亞洲來跟中國走！這多少有外交家的氣魄。胡先生在莫斯科時，共產黨人曾開過一僩大會歡迎他，會塲中有一標語「從中山主義到列寗主義。」胡先生看了，當塲卽說：「這個標語應該倒置過來，從列寗主義到中山主義，接着他便說明了他的主張，在莫斯科同共產黨人談列寗主義，這才是一種外交家的膽量」！</p>
<p>這位朋友接着說：「外交家固然要擁有交際的才能，但單會交際的人最多只配做個使館隨員」。</p>
<p>三·郭泰祺先生的妙語</p>
<p>當中國駐英公使館升爲大使館時，第一任大使郭泰祺先生，按照外交慣例，須向英王呈遞國書。英國是個愛好古董的國家，不但尊重老祖母們時代的習慣，特別是皇家的禮節，二十世紀同十七八世紀就沒有多大的區別。年輕的愛德華第八，自幼就受了這種家庭敎育，與別國的外交官來往，祖傳的一套儀式是不會忘記的。聽說，英王當時也沿用昔日的慣例，於呈遞國書時，曾對郭先生說：「朕聞年來貴國與日本邦交不睦，引以爲憂。敝團盼望世界和平，朕望貴國與日本以後能五相親善……」，儼然一種大國君土的風度。</p>
<p>這對於郭先生自然是個難題，怎麽答復呢？在這種尊嚴的局面下，怎能同英王去討論中日間的是非，他只冷冷地回答，「幸虧咱們中國地方還大！」郭先生說這句話時，幷沒有笑，可是愛德華第八，甚至於在旁的前任外相西門，一個最英國式「冷之又冷」的人物，終於也自禁不住發笑起來。</p>
<p>四·英內相西門</p>
<p>現任英內相西門，是自由黨中右翼國家派領袖。東北事變時，他會任外相，據說，當時英美對日的熊度小能一致，他要負相當的責任的。後來因意阿事件調任內相。西門內相是一位英國有名的法律專家，他的政治生活，雖說一帆風順，但似乎還沒有做到成爲一般人民所敬愛的人物，尤其在議院中，他常爲反對黨人攻擊的目標。例如常鮑爾溫首相在議院中發表內相的任命時，下院工黨某議員卽起立常西門面前質問首相，是否因爲西門辦理外交失敗了，所以首相特意請他來試辦內政！</p>
<p>內相西門，雖是一個英國典型的紳士式人物，但反對黨人對於他這一點，却絲毫不肯顧惜。因之，他在議院中的遭遇，也要比別的政治家來得可憐。記得本年七月間，英國下院辯論失業工人新律時，內相西鬥也曾爲政府作了一次辯護的演講，當時有一位工黨議員，突然站起來打斷了他的演說，指着他說，「內相在撒謊」。後來這位議員雖受了退席的處分，同時却又引起幾位工黨·自由黨。議員的不平，他們大聲吿訴西門說，「我們大家知道，內相是一位著名的撒謊者」。另外一個說，「誰都知道，你是一個最下流的撒謊者」！</p>
<p>自然，這多少總算是一種侮辱。雖以內相的政治地位，可是仍余何反對黨人不得，這是英國的議院制度。</p>
<p>五·弄巧反拙</p>
<p>英國人是世界上著名有禮貌的民族。初來倫敦的國人，總要受「老倫敦」的警吿。英國人從來不愛說人家的環話的。所以咱們中國人也應該禮尙往來，對於英國的事物千萬不要批判。記住，就是壞的事悄也要說好。例如在將要下雨特的陰大，你也應該說是好天氣。這才够紳士氣！</p>
<p>有一次，幾位中國同學去參觀一個英國某工業區中的學校。那個地方，因爲工廠林立，素來就以不衛生聞名於英國，這個　校自然也不能例外。該校校長招待時，曾先向參觀者道歉，因工業區關係，地方十分不乾凈。中國同學當時却沒有忘記英國人的紳士世禮貌，速忙回答，「那裏的話，一點也不，這裏乾凈得很」！這一來，反而弄得這位校長莫明其妙了。他想，像這樣的一個地方，中國人還認爲十分乾凈，那末，中國人的日常生活狀况可想而知！</p>
<p>紳士沒有學到家，中國反而先受累。</p>

<p>— 中國徵信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概況之四十）</p>
<p>十二、開朗乾電池廠一——該廠爲江幼南，江少南，江伯厚三昆仲合夥經營，稍收外股，設立於民國十八年，初僅製造電池，後肉乃父江一南所主辦之永豐手提燈殼廠於前年收歇，該廠遂兼造手提燈殼，資本共四五萬元，廠基爲閘北西寳興路三陽里五一號，租屋十數間，分電池燈殼兩部，共雇職工八十餘名。該廠所出電池以『融光』爲商標每日可出一千打，燈殼可出五十至一百打。</p>
<p>除上列十二家外，本埠製造燈泡，電池，電扇等電器材料者尙夥，惟以規模平平，對該業前途影響不大，　不一一備載。</p>
<p>三、電器材料之產銷</p>
<p>近况</p>
<p>各廠所產之電器材料，其銷路頗與時令有關，例如電扇熨斗以夏令爲旺月，電爈煖鍋則暢則於寒冬，他如各種手電筒亦以　收後之銷路爲佳，因內地人民往往於該時始有完裕之購買力，置備該項用品，目下若干廠家正日夜兼工製造手電筒，其故卽在於此。近年來各項軍用性之電料，銷路特佳，此與近年來軍用交通事業之突飛猛晋，實有因果關係。至運銷之地點，因電器種類而異，大概手電筒以大江以北及長江一帶電燈事業尙未發達之城鎭爲主，南洋方面亦有相當銷路。電池多數運銷漢口，長沙，重慶，宜昌，南昌，安慶等都市，再轉銷與鄉鎭，本埠及京抗一帶則類多採用外貨電池。至於電扇，電爐，熨斗，燈泡之類，倘若干大都市能銷納之，蓋電氣事業之存在爲其使用之唯一條件。（未完）</p>

<p>水年（民國二十五年）皖贛兩省，爲謀復興兩省紅茶業起見，乃有統一運銷之舉，並電請實業部派員舉辦產地檢騐，以防杜劣茶，爰由上海商品檢騐局，派員兼程前往籌辦。已於七月結東，關於祁紅區茶產品質之情形，亦有詳細報吿，茲値茶業積敝之餘，亟思整頓，因擇其關於產製銷之一部分報吿，摘嬰介紹於讀者。編者祁紅爲祁門，浮梁，至德及貴池所產紅茶之總稱，世稱祁，浮，至，而略貴池者，乃以貴池茶產過少之故也。祁紅得天然環境之獨厚，色，香，味不僅爲國產紅茶之翹楚，益且馳譽於世界紅茶市塲。價格高，銷路廣，祁紅之生產，雖僅有六十餘年之歴史，然已深印中外人士之腦中矣。</p>
<p>祁紅之生產，製造及推銷，代表三種不同階級。生產。茶農司之；精製，茶號爲之；推銷，由茶棧介紹售與洋行，本年則由皖贛紅茶總運銷處庖代茶棧之職。至於洋行辦茶，大抵乃受國外茶商之委託，居代理商之地位，故最後推銷之責，實由國外茶商負之。査祁紅誡初非生產紅茶者也，距今六十年前，以產綠茶聞名，運銷兩廣，頗負盛譽，以製法與六安茶相似，故又名安茶。至光緒二年，（一八七六年，）有黟縣余某，來自至德，在歴口設莊，勸誘茶農製造紅茶，高價收買。繼又行於閃里，利之所趨，相率改製，蔚爲今日世界馳名之祁紅。然六十年來，祁紅之產銷，亦已由盛而衰，此則深値吾人警惕者也。</p>
<p>（一）祁紅茶之產製</p>
<p>祁紅誡植茶面積，究有若干，向無統計，大抵在山坡土壤肥沃之區，平地間亦樅茶，類由茶農零星開闢，七零八落，統計無從。據金大農業經濟茶按照產量之估計，祁紅全區，共有茶地面積八萬一千五百餘市畝。</p>
<p>茶農以自耕農居多，其戶數惜無統計可考。茶農除從事植茶外，並兼栽他種作物，以裕收入。</p>
<p>祁紅茶之產製，採摘鮮葉，製爲毛菜，茶農爲之：加工精製，包裝成箱，茶號負之，分工合作，乃完成祁紅之產製。</p>
<p>祁紅區之茶號，昔日數目甚少，資本雄厚，有製茶數千箱者。後因茶價挺俏，茶棧競相放欵，以資吸收茶箱，於是茶號漲設，數目激增，製茶箱額，日見减少，成本日高，開粗製之漸。自祁歴門年茶號數目及製茶箱額觀之，可知一般矣。</p>
<p>祁門全縣歷年茶號數目及製造紅茶箱數表</p>
<p>祁門茶號製茶平均箱數，民十七年每號尙有四五六箱，至二十一年，茶號驟增至一九四家，每號平均製茶箱數，反跌至二〇五箱，較民十七减少一倍以上。是年茶號驟增之原因，乃由於民國二十年茶價特高之故，於是投機商人，羣相設號，以圖厚利。此後茶價年低，茶號亦呈减少之趨勢，惟每號製茶，尙祗二百餘箱，故其製造費用，仍不經濟也。</p>
<p>至於浮梁及至德等縣，亦具同樣之趨勢，茶產年减，而茶號反增。民國二十三年浮梁有茶號六十三家，產茶的一五、〇〇〇箱，平均每號製茶二三八箱，本年茶號增至六八家，產茶亦僅一七、八七六箱。又如至德，民二十三年僅有茶號三四家產茶的一萬箱；本年茶號增至四七家，祇產茶一一、〇四五箱。茶號與產量，卽不能同比例之增加，結果各號製茶箱數，平均减少。而茶號一切開支，並不隨製茶箱數同比例之减少，結果祁紅之成本，因之日高矣。</p>
<p>且也，茶號廣設分莊，競收毛茶，亦爲成本提高原因之一，以祁門而言茶誡在西南一隅，毌須有茶號一三〇家，施行精製；各號更毌須廣設分莊，統收毛茶，旣增製造成本，又費周折，而茶農束投西奔，反無實惠。有時輾轉跋踄，至良好毛茶，過度醱酵而劣變·故茶號之多及分莊之濫設，均有礙於祁紅茶葉之發展也。</p>
<p>合作運動，在祁紅區內之祁門，自民國二十二年，開始由祁門茶業改良塲，提倡指導，開茶農合作製茶之先聲。當時以指導有方，成績尙着。於是茶農開風景從，相繼組織茶葉運銷信用合作社，以達自有生產，自行製造，自爲運銷之目的。合作社之利益，消極而言，足以免除中間商人之削剝，積極方面，且足提高茶農生活之向上。宗皆純潔，故克在三數年中，蓬勃發展。合作社數，二十二年僅有一家，至二十五年，已增至三十六家。社員數目，隨之亦增。四年來合作運動發展之迅速，可於左表見之。</p>
<p>四年來祁門紅茶產銷合作社數表</p>
<p>合作運動之發展，確爲良好之現象，惟權衡合作運動之成功，不重量而重質，合作社如能組織健全，著有實效，則茶農不待鼓吹而自合。故提倡合作運動者，不必期求量之增加，當以質爲前提，合作運動之前途，其有豸乎。</p>
<p>（二）祁紅茶之貿易</p>
<p>祁紅茶精製裝箱以後，向由茶號水運至九江轉滬，經茶棧之手，售與洋行。木年皖贛兩省當局，實行統一運銷，改由陸運上海，不經茶棧而由皖贛紅茶總運銷處售與各洋行，此實八十年來，祁紅國內貿易未有之改革。茶棧業對於內地茶號之速繫，雖已間斷，然洋行之勢力，仍難遏制也。</p>
<p>購辦祁紅數量量多者，當通英商怡和洋行，的占祁紅產額五分之二。錦隆，協和，天裕，保昌，興成等洋行决之，華茶，同孚，天祥等又决之。據上海商品核騐局四年來之檢騐統計，祁茶出口，每年以怡和洋行爲最多，年在七八千公　。其他洋行，少則數十公擔，多則亦僅三四千公擔。綜觀左表，即可知各商行祁茶貿易之情形矣。</p>

<h3 id="c158">農作物改良方法摘要 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— 顧復</p>
<p>改良農作物之目標，不外增加產量，與改良品性，而其最終且的，在增進收益。吾人主張對於產量及品質之硏究，不僅應用統計方法，比較其結果，認爲產量與品質，均由許多因子構成，吾人應作因子分析之工作，試述共主要項目如决：</p>
<p>一，細胞方面如染色體數之多少，及其聯協（Genom）狀况。</p>
<p>二，形熊方面如根之深淺如及佈現狀况分蘗或分枝之多少，結實之狀况等。</p>
<p>三，生理方面如成熱之早晚，耐肥性之强弱等。</p>
<p>四，生態方面</p>
<p>甲，對於環境之影響如耐旱性，耐寒性等。</p>
<p>乙，對於病虫之關係隨各種農作物之種類，擇其生要之病虫害，調査共抵抗能力</p>
<p>以上各種項目，對於產量品質均有關係，且相互之問，又交相來連，正確斷定，頗不容易。於是又分析爲常熊與變態之二類。如言產量，在常熊下，可從細胞，形態，生理諸方面以推定之。在變熊下，可由生熊方面之關係推定之，則略有綫索可循。更進一步各品種之性狀，一部分爲遺傳的，一部分爲適應環境的。遺傳的在普通狀况下，不生變異，較爲確實，研究亦便。適應環境的，隨時隨地變化，極爲繁雜，必須給各種環境，試行栽培，然後方可明瞭，研究較難，如此分別研究，更有頭緒矣。</p>
<p>但遺傳的性狀亦根據適者生存之原則，現今所保存之品種，其性狀必須適於生產地之環境。因各地之氣候，地勢，水利，土質，互有不同，其所適應之作物種類與品種，亦隨之而異。吾人欲改良農作物，應先調査各地情形，劃分區域，在其區域內，滴應某類品種，應用某種栽培法，大體可以規定。育種之時，卽以此類品種爲基本品種，着手進行。如以江蘇水稻爲例，江北　早秈稻區，京鎭爲中秈稻區，蘇常一帶爲晚梗稻區，余壇附近爲糯稻區，浦東爲早粳稻區之類。區域劃定以後，則適應於該區內之品種，亦有限制矣。</p>
<p>某種農作物種類之區域，業已規定，於是調査該區內之原有品種，選定在該區內栽堵最廣者及歷年來產量最多者，供作基本品種。在此基本品種內施行選種或交配。務期育種所費之勞力，較可節省，年數可以縮短，結果務求確實也。</p>
<p>吾人主張施行育種之際，先劃定區域，决限制品種，認爲非常重要，至於育種本身工，反認爲决要。就純系育種言：則初年之選穗或選株，經此限制，被選之品系，不致甚多，在區域大，品種多之處，則選二三千，如江南之晚粳稻之類。在區域小，品種少之處，則僅選數百已足。但選種區域，不可偏於一隅，應滿佈全區。第一年亦爲單穗行，或單株行，但選探之標準不懂用目力覜測與對照行比較，而定取捨；且各行均一粒播或單株植，以便調査其各種性狀。在施行育種之前，先須决定且的，除增進每畝產量外，更就各地情形，注意早熟，耐旱性，抗病性，抗虫性等中之一種或數種，則選擇目標亦可規定矣。第二年第三年其重復次數，　種子量之增加，逐漸加多，仍　稈行制，選擇目標，除注意調査各項生伏外，兼測產量。第四年以後，可採小誡制，每區之大小，暫定爲一畝之二十分之一，重複三决，繼續三年，用由區塊排列法，以便應用變量分析法，消去土壤及年歲之差異，精密的鑑定品系產量之多寡。而調査性狀之需多量　料者，亦可於第四年後檢査之。事擇其優良者，舉行繁殖。</p>
<p>第七年起除分配於本區內各縣農塲，舉行地域性試騐外，更栽於各種不同之環境，觀察其適應之能力。如稻則施用多量肥料，或少量肥料，以騐其耐肥性之如何，俾定其適於肥地，或瘠地，及需要多量肥料，或僅需少量肥料。更灌以各種深淺程度之水，俾騐其適於乾地或濕地，山田，平田，或圩田，對於各品系，所受環境之影響，調査明白之後，得以决定該種適於何種地方，應何種地方培方法也。</p>
<p>此際更可視各品系之怔狀·應用各種之栽培方法，以調劑之。如水稻之分業少者，則增加揷秧密度，以增加個體數，藉補每個體分蘗數之减少，使在同一面積上，產量仍不致降低。俾使所用之栽培方法，恰週於該品系之需要，舉最大之生產也。</p>
<p>關於交配育種之方法，可倣照日本之制度，就氣候，地勢，水利，土質，將全國劃爲若干區。每區設一國立農事試騐分塲，舉行大規模之交配工作，至F3止。然後將此項種子、分發於該區內之各省立農事試騐塲，繼續栽培，作嚴密之調査，逐漸淘汰，王F7止。再分發於該省內之各縣立農事試騐塲，培育至該交配種固定爲止。</p>
<p>故吾人對於農作物改良機關之組織，及其業務，亦有特殊之見解。認爲中央之農作物改良機關，主要的任務，在作種種方法上之硏究，如檢査小麥之製粉率，應用何種器具，調查水稻之耐旱性，應用何種方法等。經精密之硏究，獲得相常結果，向大衆發表，俾各地之試騐塲，得以據用。至於各省之農作物改良機關，應隨該省之氣候，地勢，水利，土質，人民之習慣，劃分爲若干區。每區設立一農作物試騐塲，主持育種栽培法試騐等。如以江蘇爲例，徐海爲雜糧區，沿海一帶爲你區，江南爲晚粳區，淮南爲早秈稻區之類，均應設立省立試騐塲一所以辦理之。若以中央機關，而注意育種工作，雖設備完全，人才齊集，但所育成之良種，恐祇適於該地附近之風土，未能普及於全國，人才設備，不能盡其所用，獲得最大之效果，而各省若不劃分區域，以作物種類區分，亦不妥當。如江蘇麥作試騐塲設於銅山，不能兼顧江南之麥作改良，稻作試騐塲，設於松江，又不注重麥作，以致武進無錫宜興一帶爲主要之產麥區域，竟無省立機關擴任改良之責。而一省中，各區之省立農作物試騐塲，與縣立農事試騐塲，應互相聯絡，澈底合作，如身之使臂，臂之使指，如此適應地方，分工合作，硏究適合各地之優良品種與栽培方法，如此則農作物之改良，可指日而待矣。</p>
<p>顧震吉先生以其所著一改良農作物方法私議見貽、積二十餘年之經騐、成此著作、其內容之精審可知、愚嘗以爲解决目前民食問題、消極的爲調節、積極的爲增產、乃時賢多偏重於　節、諒爲增產之見效更緩而其事更繁也、然增產必自改良作物始、而能視此爲終身事業、孜孜不倦者、就余所知、若　君者實所罕見、故擇其全文中之一節、「農作物改良方法摘要」刋載之、以見一斑、俾略知農作物改良之途徑可也、（柳堂）</p>

<h3 id="c159">請全國的姊妹們完成這件美事 <a href="#c159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— 娟華</p>
<p>親愛的姊妹們；</p>
<p>這幾年來，我們始終相信，只有實行武裝抗敵，才是挽救危亡的唯一出路。</p>
<p>現在，綏東的戰鼓響了。貧饜不足的敵人，竟大舉進攻綏遠，而我們的守土軍士，不顧一切的敢做堅决的抵抗，這是我們全國的人民所當竭誠擁護的。捷報頻傳，百靈廟大廟先後由我軍收復，這樣下去已往的失地，只要全國同心，不難在相當的時期內次第收回，一雪以前的奇恥大辱，但是，這一任務，决不是少數人所能做到的，一定要全國的同胞，有力的出力，有錢的出錢，在抗敵的共同目標下才能實現的。</p>
<p>在最近，各地的援綏捐欵，數量上却也不少，但是要求長期的抗戰，必需要大量的接濟，我現在有一個小小的建議，要睛全國的姊妹們採納，方法簡易得很，只要省下你們一天的脂粉錢，來援助前方守土的將士，因爲我們一天不用脂粉，並沒有關係。</p>
<p>朋友：你不要當它是笑話，粗看起來，好像杯水車薪，無濟於事，但是只要集合多數的力量，未嘗不能聚沙成塔，於國家不無小補，假設全國有四千萬個姊妹們施用脂粉，（這是最少的數字）在一天內省却不用，最低限度每入可省下五分大洋，（在都市的姊妹，一定不祗此數。則共可節省二百萬元。這是一個不小的數目，把此欵匯交前方。多麼有意義，多麼實用，對於我們婦女界多麼光榮，這是一件輕而易舉的事，做起來並無困難，希望全國的女同胞大家實行，尤其要請在校的姊妹們起來倡導，完成這件有意義的美事。（筆者按，最好請滬上一家銀行，專門收集此項捐欽。一俟集有成數，再行匯交前方，看究能收到多少成績）。</p>
<h3 id="c160">「奇女子刺殷」小評 <a href="#c160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— 丁笑如</p>
<p>與施劍翹刺孫案，同屬壯舉。　可爲女同胞們，揚眉吐氣！　以身殉難，稱得起女英雄！　同死的殷副官，不可「相提並論」。</p>
<p>國家已弄到如此危急的地步，倘冉有喪心病在的人，去甘心附逆，爲虎作倀，是怎樣地可恥？並且可誅。有一句古語，呌做「亂臣賊子，人人得而誅之！」</p>
<p>每逢一個大動亂的時代，總會有許多奇人奇事產生的。最近的報上竟登有「奇女子剌殷記」一則新聞，夫殷逆甘作漢奸，久爲國人所切齒！現在居然有這麼一位奇女子，前去圖謀行刺，而結果又是那樣地白白犧牲了一條可寳貴的生命，沒有一個人讀過後不拍案稱奇，和點頭嘆惜的！何况冒險行刺這件事，又不如演劇時是做假的那麽無碍而便當呢？</p>
<p>我們祗須看她設計那樣周密、和爲了國家民族的大義，能不顧一切，犧牲己的那種精神，眞可說是智勇兼全！而敗事後，受×方的慘刑拷掠逼供，仍能神色自若，毫不畏懼，並潑口大駡殷逆，至死不說出受何人所中使，更令人肅然起敬，十分地佩服！</p>
<p>她的結果，雖然不幸失敗，而以身殉。但她的精神，是永遠存在的；她的死，可以說是偉大的，光榮的，並且更足以顯示出殷逆的罪惡。</p>
<p>和她一道殉難的，還有一個姓殷的男子——殷逆的副官。他雖然也是爲了同謀行刺不成而死，但他起初的動機，是因有金錢與美人二者之利可圖，况且原本是附逆的。敗事的成因，又根於他的不能守秘，他並非不知道他的母親是股逆的乳嫗，雖爲安全起見，儘可使她遷走好了，何必要把行刺的密謀吿訴她呢？若說這是孝，也未免太愚！以致將好事破壞眞可調「孺子不可與共大事」了。加之那老太婆又不不明大義，祇知以個人的私恩爲重，先去暗吿股逆，指望藉此邀功，仍可保全自己的兒子，誰想依舊徒然！這簡直更是愚到極點！所以她的絕後，乃是「自討」的結果。她兒子的死，也是不足惜的，絕對不能和那位奇女子相提並論的。（事實如此，並非作者言詞偏激。）</p>
<p>據說那位奇女子，原先做過舞女，並且是某人的姨太太。但斷不能因她過去的身分，而使她此番的英名，蒙受絲臺損失，正因此更覺得難能可貴！因爲一般舞女和姨太太平時的生活，大多是浪漫嬌縱慣了的，像這樣可泣可歌驚天動地的事情，慢說非舞女和姨太太們所能做的出來，連受過高等敎育的智識婦女或男子中，能有這種得勇氣人，也是鳳毛麟角！此之所以爲奇了。如果再拿殷逆，和那些仍醉生夢死終日陶悄於聲色舞塲中的男子們，來反比一下，眞正要愧煞鬚眉呢！</p>
<p>現在上海的一般戲劇家，往往將些足以驚人的「社會新聞」，搬上舞台。我覺得正不妨把這位奇女子的事蹟，也編成一個劇本，如演出時，內容曲折緊張，必定可以感動觀衆的！本來用戲劇的藝術，推廣「救國」的運動，是一個「極有意義」和「有效」的方法；使人看了這故事之後，可以覺醒奮勉，知道中國的「民心未死］，生氣仍然異常「蓬勃」！同時可明瞭中國的婦女，並非完全是些「柔弱無能」的人呵！</p>
<h3 id="c161">東北婦女過冬 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 雪文</p>
<p>塞外的天氣，在冬天，是那末冷，冷得要命。整日價吹着冷酷刺面的朔風，地面上常是有着深厚的積雪。街道上的行入是少得多了，到處都充滿着淸冷的氣象。</p>
<p>東北的婦女，特別是農村的婦女，吃苦耐勞的精神是早就爲人所共知的，她們是和男子同樣的從事於農田的工作。可是到了冬天，爲了天氣的冷，她們當然是不能再室外工作了。可是這並不是說她們就此淸閒起來，事實上她們還是整天忙着工作的。</p>
<p>頭一件事，就要算是縫製衣被了。因爲普通人家，都是要到秋冬之交來製備新的棉衣，或是重新拆洗舊被，以作過冬防寒之用。這雖然不是太繁重的事情，然而把一家人的衣件堆在一起來說，倒也須忙一個相當長的時間。因之每到冬天的時候，因了天短的緣故，她們總是每天晚上都要點燈作女紅，一直到夜靜更深的時候才登床入睡。</p>
<p>然而，早晨呢？她們仍舊是起得特別早的，天氣冷，常常會把她們的手凍裂了以致出血，當吃完了早飯以後，還是忙作女紅的。</p>
<p>因爲冷，屋裏是非得放上火盆或火爐，才能保持相常溫暖的，所以她們除了別的正當的工作外，還要經心關於這一類的事。</p>
<p>另外，因爲天氣的變幻莫測，說不上什麼時候，就要降雪，所以每當看見天氣變陰時，就要趕快收拾柴垜，預備好幾天用的柴薪，北風刮臉，好像刀割一般的難受，實在是很苦的事。然而又不能不如此，因爲假使下了雪，濕的柴薪就不能卽時燃用了</p>
<p>此外，有些地方是需要婦女來担水的，那末，便得耐着冷，去登那結着原厚的冰的溜滑的井台。那更是件困難的工作了。</p>
<h3 id="c162">二十五年來　俄國婦女的轉變 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>美國新時代雜誌記者胡特羅夫人，會於一九一二年，旅行於俄國，最近，復往旅居了三星期。回美後，寫了一篇「二十五年來的俄國婦女，」把舊俄時代的婦女，與新俄時代的婦女，作比較，極富趣味。她說，在大戰之前，旅行俄國時，勾留了二個月，那時所接觸的俄國婦女，可以歸類而爲級。第一級是貴族婦女。她們是沒有俄國人所具有的憂鬱情調的，整天到晚的喀嘻哈哈，開昔樂會，跳舞看戲，講究衣着和裝飾，是她們日常的工課。第二個階級，是平民家庭中的主婦。她們雖然在經濟力方面，是够不上貴族婦女們的，但她們也得勉力着，度她們的奢侈而享樂的虛榮生活。雖然是時常的因此而受釗丈夫的呵駡，甚至於笞責，也很少有肯改變其外强中乾的生活的。最後一種，是佔到百分之七十以上的貧苦婦女，靠着簡單的家庭工業的收入，或是爲貴族家庭中的奴役，或竟靠着秘密賣淫，或行乞，而帮助着丈夫支持家庭，或維持自身的生活。這種貧苦婦人所生的孩子，至少，有一半，是成爲流浪兒童的，因爲她們實在的無力加以扶養。但是這一次遊俄，這三個階級的痕跡，是找不到了。她曾在離莫斯科一百四十餘英里的一個鎭集上，在一家公共食堂中，遇到一位市長夫人，一位小學校長，和若干女工。這位市長夫人，是當地的一位女醫師，也略懂英語的，和胡夫人談了一陣，胡夫人才知她是市長夫人，因爲她的衣服的樸素，宛如美國西部農村之間的農婦，而且她也和其他食客一樣的僅吃着黑麵包，一湯二菜，任誰都瞧不出她的地位的。據這位市長夫人說，在蘇俄的婦女界中，是和男子一樣的只知工作，不知奢侈與怠情的享樂了。她說着，舉起她的足來，給胡夫人瞧，原來她足上穿的平跟皮鞋，在美是僅値元一雙，是黑人婦女們所穿的，而且在她的左鞋上，還補着直徑半英寸的一個補釘。</p>
<p>胡夫人說，未來俄國之前，聞人說，現在蘇俄的流浪兒童之多，是很可驚的，因爲夫婦的離婚，是太容易了，離婚之後，誰都不負扶養子女的義務。但是這次遊俄時，才知道話是需要着比較，因爲在一九一二年遊俄時，在熱鬧街市間，果然罕見流浪兒童的足跡，因爲在那時，熱鬧街市間的警察，見了流浪兒童，是無情地用手棍痛擊的。這些兒童的產生地，在事實上，是貧苦的家庭，所以若是踏入貧民窟中時，是常會給數十流浪兒童包圍着，甚至把你的首飾手袋等，都搶奪去的。在那時僅只聖彼得堡一地，據說，共有流浪兒童二十餘萬，全國各地，部有流浪兒童。但是現在莫斯科全市的流浪兒童，據說，是不足十萬人了。雖然這種官方的報吿，不能完全憑信的，但是流浪兒童的今少於昔，確是一個事實。而且這情形，也不限於莫斯科，在她這次在俄旅行一千七白餘英里　經的各地，情形正是相仿。</p>
<p>在二十五年前，夫人遊俄時，占到百分之七十以上的貧苦婦女，曾受過三四年敎宵，而識得幾個字的，白分之五都够不上。這還是聖彼得堡的情形，在農村中，可說是百不得一二。但是這一同去旅仃，在街車中，隨處的可以見到在讀書，或讀報的女工形的婦女。據說，在蘇俄四十歲以下的婦女，識字的，已佔百分之五七·七五。四十歲以上的婦女，雖然不議俄文，但能讀拉丁拼音的書報，和用拉丁拼音寫字的。也已佔　分之七十以上。在現在的俄國，有一點，是和美國婦女，截然不同的。美國婦女愈是智識高，愈是躭於奢侈與享桀。蘇俄婦女，却智識愈高，工作愈力，而生活反愈形簡單。這是蘇俄婦女，這二十五年來的一個不容忽視的大轉變。胡夫人此次遊俄，曾對若干智識界婦女，有所接觸，而問起她們「第一次五年計劃，已經完成了，現在對於人民的服御飲食，已不像前此那麽的嚴厲限制了，那麽，你們爲甚麽還不穿　樣，不塗口紅呢？」她們的回答之中，一小部分，說的是一已成習慣，一大部分，却是一在蘇俄已是沒有以美麗誘人的娼妓了」。</p>

<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>野孩子是給人輕視的，因為他雖也是一個生晳可愛大眞爛漫的小天使，沒有經過家庭的承認他的身分和地位，不能人承大統，便成了無父之兒。可是在某個時期裏，他也會給人重視的，因爲大宗不能無後的宗祧法，支使他們要在窮思極想中找到一個繼承人來，於是野孩子便成了家孩子了。</p>
<p>在事實吿訴我們，有許多大家庭裏，是野孩子成爲亢宗之子的，有許多大家庭裏，遺棄了野孩子，任着他飄泊無依的，這都是給封建勢五支配着，野孩子的有幸有不辛，果然是整個家庭制度的問題，而野孩子的母親，更多悲慘的遭遇，「留珠棄櫝」是最普遍的手段，就是珠櫝並留，也未見多大幸運，至於母以子貴的，眞是麟角鳳毛了。</p>
<p>新影片淸明時節裏的野孩子，構成了許多曲折的情節，社會的黑暗，家庭的腐敗，在反面襯托着；同情者的正義感，至性的眞愛，在正面煊染着，一個趙孟所貴趙孟所賤的野孩子，弄得七顚八倒，尤其是野孩子的母親，眞有啼笑皆非之况。黎明暉在「淸明時節裏，替天下許多被誘惑蹂躪遺棄的弱女子現身說法，沈俊替天下許多被播弄被支配的野孩子呼籲，看了　個，我們覺得宗祧法是否可以存在？而現在法律對於野孩子應如何保障？都是候得討論的問題了我們促歴史上，也可以看到幾個野孩子幹過轟轟烈烈的大事業，有過光明燦爛的大貢獻。然而政府對於野孩子的敎養衛，應有如何的處理方法？社會對於野孩子的待遇，應有何合理熊度？都是淸明時節要求於觀衆的解答的。</p>

<p>— 櫻子</p>
<p>曼納無端受誹謗，運用全力抗爭；　魏晋假裝神經病，希圖卸脫責任。</p>
<p>（東京通信）裴曼納女士廣西全縣人，自上海藝大畢業後，回省工作兩年，曾任南寗省立三女中敎職。前年來日留學，現肄業於東京法政大學社會科。</p>
<p>她的家境不很好，父親早年去世，她和她的弟弟全由她偉大的母親勞力撫養大的，因此她以往的生活是凄慘艱難，她所以能獲到今日的成就，不能不說是她自己努力和刻苦　來的。由於環境不斷的訓練，生活的析磨，把她鑄成了一副鋼硬的性格。</p>
<p>她現在的生活很簡單，除了上課外，便蟄伏在宿舍，讀她自己計劃的書籍。她的房間堆滿了報章雜誌，棹子上從未見有化裝品之類的東西，不抹脂，不塗粉，不好裝飾，完全脫去了女性的典型，走起路來壯健而雄闊，素有女軍之稱。對朋友誠懇而忠實，對社會認識很淸楚，不慣家庭和享樂的生活，性雖喜靜，但也高興和朋友辯論或探討各種問題，有空時亦參與團體的活動，玩起來時她是　任性的。但是做起事來又成爲一個嚴格而認眞的，尤其對於梧桎女子的封建勢力及一切蔑視女性的舊禮敎與傳統觀念，抨擊不遺餘力，並且做事勇敢，只認爲與社會大衆有益的，不顧一切的去幹！</p>
<p>她年紀尙輕，可是已把握着正確的理智向前邁進，她常鼓勵朋友：「人生的事業，全靠自己去奮鬥，一個人只要他不慕虛榮，不依頓，認定目標肯吃苦，肯冒險，不斷的鍜鍊自己，終會達到目的。」這樣看來她的前途，是有很大希望的。</p>
<p>下面是我和她的一段談話，牠近日正忙着應付一件假借名義散發侮辱她的傳單，這事轟動了東京留學生界，影響女同學的信譽也甚大，我便以這决新近發生的實際問題相訪。</p>
<p>「最近發生的傳單事件，事實的眞象究竟怎樣，請你發表一點意見。」</p>
<p>「呀！提到這件事情，倒是難住了我，說句老實話，換第三者來說，比較易於使人相信，但凑巧落在常車者的頭上，似乎不大好說話，不過在另一方面說來，事實的眞僞，也只有當事者最淸楚，不誇張的從實把事情吐露，並川客觀的態度來分柝也是很合理的，關於這次事件，已經鬧了一個月，（現仍在演進中），給留東同學不少的資料，給女同學很大的刺激，但是明瞭眞相而用正確的批評書在也太少，你今天把這問顯問我，在我是感到興奮的，而且願意以第三者的態度吿訴你和國內的姊妹們。</p>
<p>這事件在表面上看來像一件無聊的舉動，可以不屑置之，但嚴格地認淸的話，亦可視爲重大問題，如滿意不管的話，恐受害者會接踵而來，因信譽的破產，足以殺身斷路，像過去的「阮玲玉」僅因「人言可畏」而喪命。又如留東女同學王某，因不接受陳某的愛，而遭散發毀蔑的傳單，至今還有人在曙稱她爲姨太太，這明顯地是男子遑一已的私慾，有意揑造中傷。又如最近熊某亦因不接受某男子的要求而被他散發全無事實的傳單，她受不過這神毒辣的侵害，結果消極地跑回家鄉去了這樣不特得不着人們的同情，反助紂爲虐說她畏罪而逃。那麼，眞的女子就這樣容易受欺凌嗎？就這樣一個個的被那種毫無根據的傳單而斷送　嗎</p>
<p>説到我這决的傳單起因是這樣的：去年我的同鄉一曾奕」與「魏晋」離婚（離婚啟事登載於留東新聞），因爲我與她關係較深，在最後談判中說爲幾句公正話，便因此遭受了他的毒恨，一年來他給我許多誹謗和攻擊，我始終爲息事寗人計而置之不理，可是事有出人意料外的，他竟變本加厲，居然假借別人名義做出了變重罪惡的勾當。」</p>
<p>「他們離婚的經過和這次散發傳單的內容請你略爲述說一下。」</p>
<p>說到他倆的離異是必然的，因爲兩人旣不能相愛，那當然是各自分手的好，但男的因愛成恨，會兩次迫她自殺，要她呑金，這就可見一斑了。再說到散發傳單的這種舉動，首先就犯了借刀殺人罪，他公然用第三者趙文元（按趙君爲曾突友人魏晋常以情敵視之）的名雜來發印的，而措詞極盡揑造侮辱，「介紹男朋友」「騙錢」「假造文憑」等。其中還涉及陳監督，緣陳監督當他們離婚時亦曾責戒過他。總之魏晋這種舉動，視女子名譽爲兒戲，只圖一己之快，而不措毀滅他人，這種負國家重靑的留學生，如此敗類實屬痛心疾首！」</p>
<p>「事情到了這極，你將怎樣應付？留學生監　處及婦女會已在具體答復否？」</p>
<p>「常此事發生後，曾呈文我國駐日官廳請求澈査嚴辦，並已登報聲明，婦女會及同鄉會亦一致的援助。——據接近魏晋的友人說，他現假裝神經病，想藉此卸責，而已投醫院療治，這樣一來，友人們都表示了同情，而暗中勸我原恕了他，但我現在把這問題作爲一己的問題，主要的還是要根絕道神錯誤的思想，謊謬的行爲，使一般素來對女子抱不純正觀念的一個迎頭痛擊。在男子有時隨便尋　心，或洩洩私憤，而女子受影響甚大，甚或整個前途會因此葬送，實足使人寒心了呵……所以我下决心要用全副力量來抗爭，站在整個的婦女利益上，留東婦女名譽的保障上達到目的。希圖剷除此種行爲，給魏晋一嚴厲制裁，使此後留東學生不會再有此種行爲發生。我希望大家闡明眞象，作公理的維護，能得如願以償的話，這不僅是曼網個人之幸，亦卽留東命體女生的大幸。」</p>

<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>琦實在七歲的時候，便披上了第二襲麻衣，由孤女而變爲孤哀女了。一個那麽瘦弱的小女孩子，旣死了爹，又死掉了媽，呌伊怎樣再能生活下去呢？在這樣人獸不分的世界裏！</p>
<p>還好，琦實的祖父倒並沒有跟着他兒子媳婦一起走，並且他是那麽仁慈地鍾愛着他這個小孫女兒，一些不因爲伊是一個女而有所厭惡。雖然他是一個六十多歲已經衰老了的寒士，家中連　起碼的三間草屋都沒有，但他幸而因爲一直很窮的綠故，至今還在一家內河輪船公司裏常着文牘，每月可以領　法幣三十二元；他三十五歲時，就進這家公司，做了二十七年，只加過兩次薪水，一次二元，一次二元。他倒並不怨恨他的老闆，他覺得社會像現在這樣的不景氣，有人肯給地飯吃已經是好的了。當日他兒子活着的時候，大約有七年工夫使他過得很快樂，家裏的生活費用全由亞子負担，他所賺的錢只須充自己的零用，不料兒子突然死了，他所遺下的一些存欵才够充他的棺殮費，不到一年，媳婦又死了，道一次便把他老人家歷年的積蓄全倒空了。他雖很傷心，却還不以爲絕望，他很自滿地撫養着他的孫女，一面繼續努力着　的工作。</p>
<p>琦寳已經在附近的一家小舉堂裏念書了，雖然離家不到兩百步的路，而每天早上上學，中午回家，午後再上學，這三次總是伊祖父自己來領的，只有下午放學的一次，因爲公司裏走不　，才托同居的一位少奶奶帶領，琦寳的活潑可愛，以及伊祖父的仁慈和靄，在他們居住的那一條街上，差不多個人在稱道着了；假使這個人還有一顆人心的話，那木無論他是怎樣歡喜尋事打架，也决不會找到們祖孫倆。</p>
<p>有一個風括得很大的下午，琦寳在校門口等了好久，總不見那白頭髮的老人的行踪，伊的小肚子實在餓得不能忍受了，便冒險自己一個人奔回家去，可是伊祖父也不在家，祗剩那燒飯的張媽在大門口呆等着；琦寳聽說祖父還沒有回來，也不想吃飯了，便逼着張媽引着伊找到那內河輪船公司去。</p>
<p>「看一個痴子，看一個痴子！」在輪船公司的大門口，聚着許多的人，被他們包圍着的是一個在指手劃脚地破口大駡的老頭兒，他的臉兒全變了灰白色，兩隻老眼倒睜得很大，只是眼球已變了紅色，嘴角上還流着不少白沫，眞像個發瘋的入。</p>
<p>「你們道些吃人不吐骨頭的畜生！二十七年的交情竟一些不念了嗎！」</p>
<p>「老！老！老！你老子怎麽會老的？畜生！全被你們把我的精力括盡了！壯年，中年，從黑頭髮一直替你們做到白頭髮，有用的精力全化完了，你們如今倒嫌我老了！」他拉直了他那枯啞的嗓音直喊着，眼淚滾在鬍子上，像一顆顆的露珠一樣。他的手指着這一座灰黯的建築物，恨不能穿透過去一直指到屋子裏的人的臉上去。「你們這些畜生！連這一口飯都捨不得給我吃了！你們眞狠心啊！……你們討小老婆，送兒子上東洋去都有錢；偏少我這幾個錢嗎？你們這些狠心的畜生！……」</p>
<p>原來以爲他發瘋的人聽了他這一串尙有頭緒的話，才知道他是一個被遺棄的老伙計，但有誰能給他挺身去鳴不平呢？</p>
<p>「阿爹！畜生咬了你嗎？畜生在那裏啊？」琦寳總道是眞有什麼畜生咬痛了伊祖父，便搶上去，仲着兩隻小手，緊緊地抱住着他。</p>
<p>「畜生在那裏？屋子裏不是嗎？」祖父的手還是向那所屋子指着。</p>
<p>「屋子裏的是人啊！」琦寳很懷疑地問。</p>
<p>「是畜生！是畜生！……」</p>

<p>— 劉馨柏醫師主答</p>
<p>月經停閉</p>
<p>第一三五號，虹口鴨綠路景海小學校，戴仲康君問：內子身體素弱，患月經停閉，已有三載（初每半載一來，現時竟有一年未來者），致臉黃肌瘦，神經衰弱；現年二十三，而體重僅七十磅。一月前會服『當歸兒』數瓶，一時未能見效。茲有疑問數則，故請賜答：（一）何藥可使月經準確，並補虧弱？「當歸兒」可否繼續服食？（二）該病是否會成乾血癆？如成，何藥可治？（四）有無危險？（五）短時期內能否治癒？（六）生育有望吾？</p>

<p>咳嗽盜汗</p>
<p>第一三六號，上海蘇州路七九三號，曹楷君問：敬啓者，大兒年十三歲，體質素弱，每逢冬季，時有咳嗽之患，雖不劇烈，亦未易全愈；且至夜間頭部必熱汗濕枕，三年來冬間每每如是。自今歲十月中患瘧疾，的三星期後，雖經治痊，而左陰囊忽然腫漲——長度至二寸餘——且有微痛，至晚間睡後則縮成原狀，惟撼之則仍覺痛楚，晨起後則依然腫漲，迄今近月，雖曾服疝氣丸等，仍未見效。刻下痛楚已减，惟因腫漲，行走殊覺不便。請問：（一）體弱咳嗽，應服何藥？（二）晚間頭部有汗，因何所致？何藥可治？（三）畢丸腫脹是否疝氣？服何藥最有效？是須趨前面診否？因現在鄉間，來申諸多不便之故</p>
<p>答：（一）有肺「結核」之可疑，服「魚肝油』（Cod—Liver　Oil　‘Star　Brand）『克遼銷　丸　（Pills　Creobote)(二)盜汗為肺結核之一症狀，服「漳腦酸」（Ecid　Camphoric),並適用一切結核病之調養法！（三）是疝氣，行外科療法，服藥無效。（四）並不一定請余診洽，向當地正式醫師就診可也。</p>
<p>紅斑白斑</p>
<p>第一三七號，南市城內兪家衖一六七號，蔣鼐君問：敝人每至冬天雙手皮膚發乾，在跑到暖熱的地方，雙手會發張，眞是不堪其苦。再敝人四肢有紅斑白斑甚多，有時發癢，已有兩年。（一）請問是什麽病？（二）怎樣可以把牠醫好？（三）怎樣會生這種病？</p>
<p>答：皮膚發乾是由「皮脂缺乏」而來，可用『凡士林』塗擦。『雙手發漲』，『四肢紅斑白斑』云云，因來函所叙欠詳，不能於此廖廖數字中推知何病。不知何病，當然無從答覆。原因與療法，須待面診後方知。</p>

<p>黃疽死亡</p>
<p>第一三九號，前人間：又敝人有胞弟，因患黃疸病，在某醫院診治。後經醫師開腹，並未取出何物。據該醫生云：『係患肝病，乃不治之症』。果於開腹後十日死亡。現請問：（一）此病是由邊傳得來否？（二）梅毒會傳染至肝部吾？</p>
<p>答：（一）阡病有多數，預後各不同，『肝病乃不治之症』，未免不合邏輯。由經過言之，大抵不出『肝硬變』（Liver　Cirrhosis),「急性黃色肝萎縮』（Acuter　Yellow　Atrophy)二病，二病皆不治之症。（一）二病皆非遺傳病。（二）能，所謂『肝梅毒』是，但經過無如是之速。梅毒性肝臟病經過之速，一如來函所叙者，拾『梅毒性肝硬變』外無他。</p>
<p>是否梅毒</p>
<p>第一四〇號，閘北吉祥里十號，張盛君問：本人前會患淋病，幸經治愈，迄今已七月餘。在月餘前兩腿部發現癬樣大一塊多起，右膝蓋後面屈灣處更甚，發癢。近因抓破，十分難過，因此精神受刺激，每夜多失眠。請問（一）是否梅毒現象？（二）如梅毒，照現在情况須多少時間可治愈？（三）三月前騐血無淋病及梅毒，何以不可靠？</p>

<p>：（一）服「補美心」（Bromagsin)可治各種症狀。手淫之關鍵在君各人，君欲治則治，無藥可服。不過手淫之害，君諒非不知，何不拿出些勇氣來戒絕這種惡習慣？（二）非畸形，人皆如此。</p>
<p>白帶和吐血</p>
<p>第一四二號，黃沛碼路長江街五十四號，李晶晶女士問：我今年十八歲；至於今年給婚。但婚後月經不來，嚐睡，食不人味。同時白帶甚多，用藥後稍見痊。此外飯後咯疾，痰中有時帶血。請問（一）月經不來有何療法？（二）嗜睡，食不入味，與月經不調有無關係？（三）白帶之療法？（四）何故咯痰帶血？（五）這病要不要緊？（六）丈夫給我置來紅色治白帶藥水，請問是何藥？</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>賣國求榮是漢奸的唯一職志，把國家賣出去，自己可以居高位食厚祿，這誠然是得計的。因此許多喪心病狂之徒，就顧不了什麥罪大惡極，唾駡任你唾罵，漢奸我自爲之。不過賣國而能達到求榮目的的，雖也有幾個。現在偽國一批大小狗官，不是都顯耀起來了嗎？而殷逆獨覇一方，亦儼然一傀儡領袖。但運命不佳，以致走上末路的，也正大有其人。第一號漢奸鄭孝胥，曾經得意一時，目前則已消聲匿跡。他本人委實想不到老境會這樣的凄凉。至如其他被主子一脚踢走的，自然更是可憐之至。</p>
<p>就以最近大舉侵綏的匪蒙僞軍來說，像王英這個叛逆，他未嘗不大做其賣國求榮之夢。然而結果却又是怎樣了呢？歸化電：「王英匪失敗後，卽率殘部竄至士木爾台一帶，近奉某方命，復由土木爾台調至商都北加比廟，某方責令主率殘部數百人，竄擾綏西，王請補充槍械，某方不允，王大不滿，某方恐王反正，遂於二十一夜，將王刺死於該廟，王之殘部，立被繳械」。</p>
<p>自綏戰發生以後，時傳王本人有反正的意思。如果王逆眞能及早覺悟，率部來歸順，未始不可以洗去漢奸的罪名。無奈他利欲熏心，尙圖頑抗，遂難免要走上來路了。這也算是一種罪大惡極的報應吧。一班希望嘗漢奸滋味的，可以鑒諸。</p>
<h3 id="c169">打更者 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 凡甲</p>
<p>這幾天夜裏又聽見打更的聲音了。在寒夜的靜空中，那鑼聲和梆聲是淸澈而沉着，彷彿打更入的憂鬱都從那面銅鑼和梆子上發洩出來。我是不喜歡把頭蒙在被窩裏睡覺的，卽使是在冬天；但是聽見了那更聲，就不由地把頭緊緊蒙着，希望我能安靜地睡去。事實却恰恰相反，蒙緊被窩祗是眼睛瞧不見，耳朶是更聰明了，那打更聲音彷彿就近在我臥室的窗外，甚至響到枕畔來了。</p>
<p>打更的是一個矮小的老人，他有一對厲害的近視眼，我不知道他從什麼時候起就做了這行業的。而且鎭上人對於這行業也從來就沒有看重過。他沒有打更的月費也沒有一所可以避風雨的更樓，讓他孤獨住在士地祠裏。每逢節上，</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>就像一個乞丐，按門挨戶去討一點賞錢，和一些應時食物：如新正的糕糰，端節的角黍，中秋的月餅。到了年底，也有大戶入家大發慈悲賞他些殘羹冷餚。他就那樣菲薄地生活着。</p>
<p>今年夏天，那老人生了病，幾天沒有出來打更。徧徧在那幾天裏鈸上出了二伴竊案。事主在覺到失了束西肉痛的時候，忽然注意起打更的行業了，差人去責駡那老人不應該因爲生病而不打更，失去的東西是要他償還的。這自然是說說而已，或許竟是那差去的人加上的鹽醬。但是下一天那老人眞的扶病出來打更了。</p>
<p>在乘凉的時候，我看見他一頭蝦蟆似的從鎭東到鎭西，胸前掛着竹筒，手裏執着銅鑼，篤篤鐺鐺地打起更。到我家門前時，他向坐着的人討杯茶喝。因爲他是近視，就隨口喊着「太太，奶奶，我討杯茶喝」。簡直和乞丐一般的可憐。</p>
<p>不知是誰，發出一聲悠長的嘆息，接着就有人向他問長問短。或許他也疲倦了，就席地坐在階石上叙述他的身世。他說：</p>
<p>「……打更還是爺代里傳下來的。就在爺手里有回鎭上出了大竊案，由大家議决取消了每月一吊錢一家的月費，祗有節上討點賞錢。這碗飯本來是難吃的，自己這把年紀又沒有一個親人，一個兒子混在廟塲里做流氓，他也不認得我這個做老子的……那些短命賊也和我作對，生了幾天病就偸了東西……」</p>
<p>喝了茶，他又敲着銅鑼梆子走了。那一天夜裏好像他很打得起勁，我醒來時總聽見在牆外走過，有一次還是被更聲打醒過來的。</p>
<p>第二天早上却有人發現他躺在鎭東的白菜樹下，面色鐵靑嘴里吐着白沫，已經不省人事了。把他抬回土地祠里，他才甦醒過來，斷斷續續地吿訴，他打更到鎭東的時候，遠遠看見一個人依在白菜樹下，他咳嗽着，把鑼聲敲得更重，那個人却不理會，等他奔過去的時候，彷彿迎面被劈了一掌，就那樣不省人事了。</p>
<p>於是有人猜測白菓樹上有妖，並且搬出一些古老的故事來證明那顆樹曾經被天雷劈過，也有人說是那老頭子病昏了編造出來的。總之，那打更的老人就那樣死去了。</p>
<p>幾個月來，這行業沒有人繼續，雖然有人建議過仍是每戶按月出點月費僱用一個打更人。不料那個混在廟塲里做流氓的老人兒子却悄悄地回鎭上來了，他沒有管得人家同意不同意，到土地祠里接承了他父親的遺產－一個竹筒，一面銅鑼打起更來，而且他會得唱：「寒天臘月，火燭小心！」或者「前門看看，後門撑撑。」提醒人家防火防賊的俚歌。</p>
<p>已經幾個月沒有聽見更聲，現在聽來好像很不舒服，雖然很多人家是歡迎這一個勤職的打更人。我很想見一次那年輕人，做流氓不是很自由的麽？在廟塲里做流氓更是個肥缺，他却願意來承接這並不被入看重的行業。</p>
<p>現在他又從鎭東回來了，走過我家牆外的時候，他又唱着「火燭小心」！的俚歌，或許外面刮着大風吧？</p>
<h3 id="c170">上帝慈憫商店 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>美國台克柴斯州華勒鎭有一家商店，和普通商店的性質完全不同。看了它的招牌，便令人十分詫異，那便是「上帝慈憫商店。」「上帝」二字，寫得格外大，凡是信奉基督敎的人，走過店前，當然都要注意這幾個大字。店門前還放着一方大木版的廣吿，上面寫道：</p>
<p>「本店各貨，一律照本出售，不加分文餘利，顧客在買價之外，隨意樂助，本店不勝感謝。」</p>
<p>讀了這幾句廣吿，便能明白這店的性質了。原來這店所陳列的物品，都照進本，加上運費種種開銷，賣給顧客，不加分文餘利。顧客如願在買價之外，付點酬勞費，不拘多少，都聽其便。倘若在買價之外，不付一文，也同樣待遇。顧客所付的酬勞費，有多至及貨價白分之二十的，也有照本買去，不多付分文的。但店主從不因此皺眉，有所留難，而對於付酬勞費的，也只冷淡地道謝一聲，中並不表示特別感激的悄態。</p>
<p>這店設在一所洋鐵皮蓋成的平房中，已有二十二年的歷史。開辦的時候，範圍很小，現在已擴成幾個門戶的大商店。所售的物品，有雜貨，乾貨，五金用具，肉食，並各項食品，還設了一個零售汽油站。四五十哩以內的畜牧塲主，和農民，都乘車前來照顧，所以常常顧客盈門。在不景氣時代，別家商店，都牛意淸淡，唯有這「上帝慈憫商店」，依然生意興隆。</p>
<p>這店的主人，名裴維斯，穿着灰色的褲子，無領結的襯衫，捲着兩袖，站在鐵欄裏面賬檯前，額上的頭髮很稀，年紀將近六十光景，兩眼藍色，眼角的皺紋，很覺得幽默，善氣迎人，常和顧客談笑。自從他創設這店後，許多鄰人和顧客都爭先恐後，來享受這個便宜機會。他們很多只照成本買物而去，不另付一文酬勞費，曾有一位老顧客，對人說道：「裴維斯願意做傻子，我却不做傻子，我歷年在他店裏買物，除血本給價外，從未多付一文。「但是裴維斯對於這位一毛不拔的經濟家，仍和其他顧客同樣招待，從未在詞色之間，表示絲毫不滿。一日這人又向店裏採辦了許多物品，照他的老規矩，付淸本價，便把物裝上運貨車，揚鞭而去，但是隔不上數分鐘，他又回到店前，跳下馬車，奔入店中，摸出一張二十元的鈔票，遞給店主道。。「我不能老是照本買貨，不給「上帝慈憫商店」一點酬勞。」</p>
<p>說起裴維斯氏開設這商店的動機，却有一段神話。原來裴氏是一個跪在棉田塵土中尋拾棉朶的工人，並未受過良好敎育，亦未和任何敎會有何關係。他在二十二年前，正伏在田中工作的時候，忽然週身血液緊張，得到神的啟示，命他創辦這種事業，替男女老少服務，那便是替上帝服務。據說，連那店名，也是神所啟示的。裴氏曾對人說道：「我從未當過商店的夥計，也從未想到開店兩個字·我受了神的啟示，便變賣我所有的一切，開成這店。我從未轉念到能否靠此生活，我只知道遵神命行事。這店居然日見興隆，我把所得的酬勞金全數用在店內。這不是我的資財，也不是我的營業。這店愈大，我服務便能更多。」就裴氏平日言行而論，很覺誠實，待人很有禮貌，毫不喜歡誇張，有時報館訪員　他許他們映個肖像，登載報上，他却絕對辭謝。這樣看來，他開設這個商店，絕不像假託神名，標新立奇，博取虛譽。但是　那一段神話，只好姑妄聽之了。</p>
<p>這店還有一個特點，那便是店中的夥伴，都無薪水，每月月底裴氏把顧客所付的酬勞費，結出一個總數，然後由裴氏視各人職務的大小，按成分配，大的平均可得百分之四。這店初開的時候，各物售價，確比別家商店便宜得多，但至現在鄰近已有許多商店紛起競爭，所以和別家相差已無幾了。不過「上帝慈憫商店」牌子業已做出，一般老顧客大都願意照顧那裴維斯老頭兒，所以他店裏的營業，總比別家旺盛。裴氏曾談起店中顧客的形形色色：「從這些人中間，很可以發見許多有趣的事。有幾位財力大可把我店全盤買去，但是他買物，除了貨本之外，從不多付一文。很有些平常人却很慷慨，他們所付的酬勞費，令人常覺得却之不恭，受之有愧云。</p>
<p>像裴維斯的這種商店，却可稱爲一天地良心　店「吾國所謂大廉價」，「大犧性，「童叟無欺一，不二價」的老生常談，還値得一顧麽？</p>

<p>(Nanjing) During the Judicial Yuan Memorial Week on the 21st, President Ju encouraged his colleagues to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the party and sacrifice and struggle in response to the Xi'an Incident. His words were quite insightful, stating that in the past week, everyone was stimulated by the Xi'an Incident and had feelings of grief and anxiety. However, in the past week, the true nature of the rebellion and harm to the country has become clear, and the whole country has unanimously condemned it. The Central Committee has ordered the party army to suppress it, and the progress has been extremely rapid. Everyone has once again felt a sense of comfort and stability. In responding to the incident this time, the Central Committee, from a rational point of view, has adhered to the principle that the Han and the traitors cannot coexist and that severe punishment must be applied with military force. The reason is upright and the teacher is famous. From the point of view of strength, the quality and quantity of the rebellious army exceed the rebel army. Wherever the teacher goes, it is like destroying trees and pulling out rotten wood. Everywhere has made it possible for the rebel army to accelerate its collapse. Therefore, our feelings about the Shaanxi affair can be said to be getting better every day. Now the Jianshi Department has initiated a pledge of allegiance to the party, the country, and Chairman Chiang by the people of the capital, which is of great significance. Because a revolutionary Jianren must have the determination to sacrifice everything for the party. With this kind of loyalty, the party can generate great power. Although I am very sad and angry about the Xi'an Incident, I feel very calm in my heart, because it is very common for a revolutionary party member to encounter this kind of thing. What we need most at the moment is not grief and anger, but how to recognize our enemies and how to eliminate the obstacles to the revolution in order to rescue our leaders from danger. We must not lose our spirit of bravely moving forward because of this shock, and we must not allow the foundation of our revolution to be shaken in the slightest. Thinking like this, we feel as calm as ever and calmly engage in business. Ju continued to hear that the country is now under party rule, and the legal circles should have a deep understanding of the party and strive for and be loyal to the party's principles. Finally, he said that although future incidents are difficult to predict, historical examples are indeed testable. We study the past and deduce the future, and there is a certain unchanging principle. For example, the troops trained by Mr. Chiang himself, even though Mr. Chiang lost his freedom, can still be commanded and fought by the party because of the green reason of doctrine. This is not an accident. This is the harvest of doctrine. It is the effect of Mr. Chiang's decades of hard work in instilling doctrine into them. We can know the importance of doctrine, the importance of party members' understanding of the party, and the importance of the people's faith in the government. When we swear allegiance to the country and the leaders today, we must only summon the spirit of great fearlessness, sacrifice everything, and strive to complete the historical task of revolution.

Since joining the army for several years, they have never failed to take saving the country and defending the people as a prerequisite. However, since the September 18th Incident, the national affairs have been deteriorating day by day. Patriotic people are all filled with grief and indignation. Although they have the heart to save the country, they have no power to save the country, and they are helpless. At the time of a certain party's management of Chabei, they took the opportunity to join, originally to endure humiliation and cultivate strength, wait for the time to move, and secretly plan to recover. Although the way to save the country is different, the heart of patriotism is the same. They were planning to endure and slowly plan to recover. Unexpectedly, with a thunderbolt, Chairman Chiang was detained in the Xi'an Incident, which shook the country. The De Wang puppet government took advantage of the opportunity to conspire on a large scale to invade Sui East in order to realize its dreams over the years. The domestic chaos has been restless, and the border situation is deteriorating again. If we do not quickly rise up to save ourselves and try to reverse the situation, the future of the country will be unimaginable. Therefore, we resolutely united with armed comrades and telegraphed to obey the central government, which both hindered the progress of the puppet Mongolian army and reduced the central government's border concerns, eliminated hidden dangers invisibly, and turned hostility into friendship. Although the ambition of saving the country in a curved line has not been fully realized, the heart of saving the crisis and suppressing rebellion dares to question the heavens. In the future, we can only support the central government under the leadership of Chairman Fu, resist strong enemies from outside, and suppress rebellions from within, so as to fulfill the duties of a soldier and achieve the goal of saving the country. We hope that the wise men at home and abroad will not abandon the remote areas and give us guidance from time to time so that we can follow them. We are eager. (Special Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Shenyang News, Before the September 18th Incident, the Japanese used "Fengtian" Province as their base for invading Northeast China. Today, the Japanese are making great efforts to develop Fengtian Province in order to achieve Japanification. The most vigorous effort of the Japanese is the detailed survey of the population of various counties in the puppet province, strict prevention of the activities of the Righteous Armies, and at the same time, strict rule to establish so-called Japanese security. The Japanese survey of the population of the 28 counties in the puppet province and the comparison with the previous four years are listed below.</p>

<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>(5) Promotion of Industry and Development of Trade; 57</p>
<p>(1) Strengthening the Control of Electricity. 1</p>
<p>(2) Self-Sufficiency in Liquid Fuels. 22</p>
<p>(3) Self-Sufficiency in Steel. 3</p>
<p>(4) Securing Fiber Resources. 2</p>
<p>(5) Promoting and Controlling Trade. 11</p>
<p>(6) Promotion of Aviation Industry. 9</p>
<p>(7) Promotion of Naval Industry. 1</p>
<p>(8) Promoting Overseas Development of Nationals. 4</p>
<p>(6) Establishment of Important Policies for Manchuria. 25</p>
<p>Of this major national policy expenditure (1.065 billion yuan), the national defense reinforcement expenditure of the Army and Navy amounted to 691 million yuan, accounting for about 65% of the total. Tax system improvement expenditure was 237 million yuan, accounting for 25%. In addition, national livelihood stabilization expenditure, industrial promotion expenditure, trade development expenditure, and important policy establishment expenditure for Manchuria totaled 135 million yuan, accounting for only 13% of the total. Accordingly, the so-called important national policy is in fact biased towards military aspects. Moreover, from these specific figures, one can also understand what is at the core of the "renovation of all administrations" advocated by the Hirota cabinet.</p>
<p>(3) Strengthening Mainland Policy</p>
<p>In 1930, Japan's military expenditure was only 442 million yuan, accounting for only 28% of the budget at that time. Now, military expenditure has exceeded three times that amount. The increase in military expenditure is mainly due to: 1. Strengthening air power. 2. Strengthening military preparations in Manchuria. 3. Improving military equipment. The main aspects of the navy are: 1. Warship construction costs. 2. Expansion of air power. 3. Preparation for naval warfare.</p>
<p>Given the current situation in Japan, such expansion of naval and military preparations is naturally very necessary. However, as Japan expands its military by one point, China's problems become more acute. The so-called national defense on the Japanese side, in essence, is to realize its mainland policy. "To conquer Asia, one must first conquer China. To conquer China, one must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia." This famous saying of Tanaka is the main backbone of the mainland policy. Now that Manchuria has separated from China, Inner Mongolia is also organizing a government under the name of anti-communism and attacking Suiyuan. According to the declaration of the puppet Manchukuo on December 6, cooperation between Manchuria and Mongolia is inevitable. All these actions are based on the theory of mainland policy. If the mainland policy is further strengthened, the situation in Asia will inevitably undergo more changes!</p>
<p>(4) Tax Increases and Bond Issuance</p>
<p>The main sources of funding to support this huge budget plan for Japan are mass tax increases and the issuance of public bonds. Japan's tax revenue for fiscal year 1937 is budgeted at 1.424 billion yuan, an increase of 501 million yuan compared to 1936. Among the various tax increases, the increase in income tax is the largest, from 231 million yuan to 525 million yuan, an increase of 294 million yuan. In addition to general tax increases, many previously non-existent tax systems have been newly established, such as property tax, special tax on foreign goods, gasoline tax, sales tax, foreign trade statistics tax, and import control tax. The revenue from these new taxes is approximately 77 million yuan per year. Other increases, such as the increase in the price of tobacco and postal services, and the decrease in postal savings interest, also generate approximately 12 million yuan per year. Although there are voices of resistance from the lower classes against these tax increases, the result will definitely be their implementation.</p>
<p>Accompanying the tax increases is the increased issuance of public bonds. The planned issuance amount of Japanese public bonds for fiscal year 1937 is 961 million yuan. What impact will this fiscal policy of tax increases and bond issuance have on Japan's future finances? Finance Minister Baba once said at a cabinet meeting on the budget: "In the future, the public bond policy should adhere to the limit of one billion yuan for the next five years. Moreover, tax increases are not an absolute policy." He also said: "After five years, the public debt can be gradually reduced, from one billion yuan to eight hundred million yuan or seven hundred million yuan."</p>

<h3 id="e29">Chairman Chiang's Departure from Shaanxi and Arrival in Luoyang <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang, who had been staying in Xi'an, safely left Shaanxi and arrived in Luoyang yesterday afternoon. This newspaper received an urgent telegram from Luoyang and immediately published an extra edition, announcing it to the entire city. The citizens, upon hearing the news, set off firecrackers to express their joy. The enthusiastic and uplifting situation was unprecedented since the national crisis. This fully demonstrates the general public's deep concern for the nation's affairs and the sincerity of their loyalty to the leader, which cannot be denied by any party.</p>
<p>From the occurrence of the Xi'an Incident to the present, two weeks have passed. Everyone with a bit of sense has been deeply worried. The safety of Chairman Chiang has been the concern of both China and foreign countries. Whether in cities or rural areas, whether scholars are wise or foolish, nearly everyone has made this the focus of discussion. It is because at this moment of national crisis, Chiang, as the leader responsible for foreign affairs, cannot be without freedom for even a day, lest the entire situation be shaken. Fortunately, the leader, who is looked up to by the entire nation, has been able to safely leave Shaanxi and fly to Luoyang. This is undoubtedly a great relief to the people. The unified situation, which was nearly ruined, can be restored to completeness. The clouds of worry and doubt that have shrouded people's hearts for half a month have suddenly dissipated. This is fortunate for the future of the nation, and is not merely a personal turning point from danger to safety.</p>
<p>Although the details of Chiang's departure from Shaanxi are not yet known, it must have been due to the protection of public opinion. Since Chiang was kidnapped, national public opinion has been full of condemnation. Telegrams demanding the suppression of the rebellion have been flying in. Even people in foreign countries have expressed deep regret. The impression given to Xi'an was even greater than a fierce bombing. No matter how arrogant a person may be, in this confrontational environment, one should not be able to boast. The expression of the power of the people's will should not be taken lightly.</p>
<p>While wishing Chairman Chiang a speedy recovery, we earnestly hope that he can return to Nanjing as soon as possible to preside over the central government's affairs, to comfort the people's longing. In this moment of universal joy, Chiang should also be deeply mindful of what he has experienced. After this twist, we predict that Chiang will be able to further develop and expand his resolute spirit, in order to alleviate the current difficulties, establish the country on a permanent basis, and live up to the sincere support of the entire nation for the leader. On this day of welcoming Chiang's escape from danger, we have even greater and more eager hopes for the future of the country.</p>

<p>(Paris) Last night was the eve of the Christmas holiday. Although the city of Paris was shrouded in heavy fog and a cold wind was blowing, it was filled with brilliant lights and joyful atmosphere. Restaurants prepared special delicacies for their guests. The high-end restaurants on the Champs-Élysées had the atmosphere of welcoming guests as if they were returning home. Even the second-class restaurants in ordinary areas were crowded. Diners sat around Christmas trees and feasted, laughing and dancing. The cost of dining was the same as last year. Although the ticket prices for theaters and concert halls were doubled compared to normal days, they were all sold out. Latecomers were disappointed. Movie theaters also operated all night, and were crowded with audiences. At midnight, pedestrians on the main streets were like a surging tide. The lights shone like waves. Such an excited atmosphere was rare. In churches, midnight mass was held according to old customs. Believers gathered, and the sound of music and singing echoed each other, adding to the grand occasion. As for the poor, they also enjoyed the benefits of the holiday.

<p>(New York) Pope Pius XI recently read a decree in the Vatican Palace on the eve of Christmas, broadcast by radio to countries all over the world. At that time, it was 6:30 AM American time. Millions of American male and female believers got up early to listen to the Pope's decree on the radio. The sound was very loud and clear, no different from the speech made by the Pope at the inauguration ceremony at St. Paul's Basilica in Rome in 1922. At times, the sound was so loud that the listeners in New York almost felt as if they were in St. Peter's Square in front of the Vatican Palace, personally listening to the Pope's cough. When the decree mentioned the call for peace, the sound of sobbing could be clearly distinguished. As the reading was about to end, the Pope seemed a little tired and coughed frequently, but he still mustered his remaining strength to finish the speech. Although some words were choked in his throat, the overall speech was smooth. People in New York generally believed that since the Pope was able to read the decree for as long as thirty minutes, it showed that he was still energetic. Although His Holiness is currently feeling unwell, there is nothing to worry about. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Vatican City Today, the Pope gave a Christmas broadcast from his bed to the world, urging people to be wary of destructive forces. Many great demons are now preparing to make a tragic reality in the world, harming human civilization and the church, which is hateful. He then mentioned the shocking disaster of the Spanish Civil War, saying that the villains he had repeatedly mentioned in the past seemed to want to spread their destructive forces throughout the world, to carry out extreme tests. These people are plotting to make Europe and the world suffer tragedies, and the signs of this are already obvious. This kind of hidden danger has never been as worrisome as it is today, and it will endanger the foundation of European civilization. Among those who claim to lead the defense of order to resist the destruction of civilization and the spread of atheistic communism, there is no lack of those who are misled by foolish and harmful ideologies in their choice of remedies and identification of enemies, which makes people feel painful. The Pope also mentioned the events of this year, appealing to the world to make every effort to maintain peace. For this reason, he prays even more fervently to God today to use His great power to bring tranquility to the world, for only in this way can there be peace, and only in this way can personal and collective justice be implemented, for there can be no tranquility without it. The Pope did not present a prayer to the Catholic Church, but focused on the disaster in Spain. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Valencia Government newspapers today were very angry about the Pope's call for peace in Spain. The newspaper Freeda de said that the Pope called for world peace, but Italian fascists attacked the Spanish people, and the Holy See now declares its support for the instigators of the internal strife. The Valencia Communications Daily said that if the Pope wants to maintain peace, he should stop criticizing the Communists and call on the Spanish rebels to cease fire.

<p>Prague, Czech Republic President Beneš delivered a radio address for Christmas, recounting the international situation and Czech foreign policy over the past year. He said that in 1936, the situation of mutual confrontation between fascist countries, communist countries, and democratic countries became increasingly acute. Although the Czech Republic has not abandoned its belief in upholding the League of Nations, on the other hand, it has tried to use other forces to make up for the shortcomings of the League of Nations. For example, the alliance treaty between the Czech Republic and France and the Little Entente countries, the mutual assistance pact between the Czech Republic and Russia, and the friendly relations between the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom and the Balkan Entente countries are all intended to strengthen the forces of peace. Mentioning France, Beneš said that France has sufficient reason to feel worried about its security. Mentioning Germany, he said that the European peace plan put forward by Chancellor Hitler on March 29 of this year should be seriously considered. Finally, Beneš added that the Czech army has been greatly strengthened in 1936, and fortifications have been added to all borders. (Havas dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Reports indicate Japan intends to negotiate Pacific issues with the United States. It is understood that the matter originates from the question of maintaining the status quo regarding fortifications and naval bases on Pacific islands (as stipulated in Article XIX of the Washington Naval Treaty). Britain had previously, in September, communicated to both the U.S. and Japan, advocating for negotiations to renew said article. However, neither the U.S. nor Japan offered a formal response. Until recently, Japan began advocating for negotiations with the U.S. U.S. diplomatic circles seem to generally support this proposal, but believe that such negotiations should not be limited to the U.S. and Japan. All signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as the Soviet Union, should be included, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(London) Rumors suggest that Japanese Foreign Minister Arita is about to issue a statement supporting joint cooperation between Japan, the U.S., and Southern nations to avoid an arms race in the Pacific. Observers here attach great importance to this rumor and express satisfaction, believing that if this statement is confirmed, it will bring about significant changes to the situation created by Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Conference. In particular, all relevant countries should be included in any negotiations regarding Pacific issues, with Britain being one of those countries, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(London) The British government formally notified the U.S. and Japan a few days ago that it intends to invoke Article XXI of the London Naval Treaty, the "escalator clause," to retain five cruisers that have reached their service age. The Japanese Embassy in London formally notified the Foreign Office this afternoon that the Japanese government has also decided to invoke the above-mentioned escalator clause to retain 11,000 tons of submarines that have reached their service age and not destroy them, according to a Havas news agency dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram sent by Ambassador Yoshida in Britain to the Foreign Ministry on the 24th, the British government formally informed Ambassador Yoshida on the 22nd that Britain would invoke the escalator clause of Article XXI of the London Treaty to retain and refit five Class B cruisers exceeding their age, in order to strengthen air defense facilities. Therefore, Foreign Minister Arita, based on the British government's previous inquiry into Japan's intentions, to which he had given an informal response at the time, instructed Ambassador Yoshida to formally reply to Britain immediately, expressing no objection. He also telegraphed Ambassador Saito in the U.S. to make a similar notification to the U.S. government. Meanwhile, Japan, having broken away from all arms limitation treaties from January next year, will regain freedom to build ships. Prematurely abandoning ships exceeding their age and rebuilding them would only increase the burden on the people and defeat the spirit of arms reduction. Therefore, from this perspective, it acknowledges Britain's proposal, according to a Domei News Agency dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Foreign Minister Arita at the Foreign Ministry on the 24th to communicate the U.S. government's opinion on the issue of cruiser retention. He stated that the U.S. intends to acknowledge the escalator clause automatically proposed by the British government. According to this provision, the U.S. can retain 10% of the total tonnage of destroyers, or 19,000 tons. After the U.S. Ambassador conveyed this information, he inquired about the Japanese government's opinion. The Foreign Minister replied that the Japanese government would instruct its ambassadors in Britain and the U.S. to report their opinions to the governments of their respective host countries. After the two discussed this issue, they also exchanged views on the China issue, according to a Domei dispatch on the 25th.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The outcome of the negotiations between Japan and Australia is a compromise agreement, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan will import 800,000 bales of wool every year and a half, while exporting 153.7 million square yards of textiles during the same period. (2) Regarding tariff issues, the tariff rates of May 23 will be abolished, and the increase in tariffs will be limited to 5% to 10% for cotton cloth and 5% to 15% for rayon.</p>
<p>The government will consult with the Tariff Investigation Committee on the 26th before holding a cabinet meeting to decide on the cancellation of the Trade Protection Act launched against Australia, according to a Domei dispatch on the 25th.</p>

<p>(London) Powerful figures here are organizing a company to facilitate commerce between Britain's dominions and colonies, and to assist European nations with exchange restrictions that are reducing their normal trade. The main purpose is to barter goods with Germany. The company is purely British capital, and the British government has no objection. The governments of the dominions have endorsed it, and the German government has also agreed to provide certain conveniences and special benefits. The company also hopes to trade with Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, selling them grains, fats, oils, leather, flax, and rubber. In the event of war, deliveries to belligerent countries will naturally be suspended. According to company officials, trade within the British Empire is expected to increase, because countries like the U.S. and Japan currently only sell goods to British dominions without buying from them. Under the company's new plan, buying and selling must be balanced, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>

<h3 id="e42">British and French Ambassadors in Berlin Urge Germany to Reconsider and Abide by Non-Intervention Agreement; Advice Also Given Separately to Italy, Portugal, and Russia <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the British Foreign Office has instructed its ambassadors in Germany and Italy, as well as the Ambassador to Russia and the Minister to Portugal, to advise the governments of their respective host countries to make efforts to strengthen the constraints of the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish Civil War. It is also reported that the French Ambassador to Britain, Corbin, yesterday notified the British Foreign Office of a list of surveillance plans for the non-intervention measures in the Spanish Civil War, indicating that the French government is prepared to implement them immediately to prevent the Spanish Civil War from escalating into a pan-European conflict. However, France's implementation of these measures is conditional upon all relevant countries making the same decision, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Foreign Office has instructed its ambassadors in Germany, Italy, and Russia, as well as the Minister to Portugal, to advise the governments of their respective host countries not to send volunteers to Spain to join either side of the civil war, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(Paris) France today intends to seek international cooperation to prevent Germany from aiding the Spanish rebels. A government spokesperson said that France is willing to use any strict method to assist the Non-Intervention Committee in preventing other countries from intervening in the Spanish Civil War. According to reliable sources, France believes that Germany's intervention in Spanish affairs by aiding the rebels will create a new situation. Although France does not want to act alone, it will seek the most straightforward and effective international control methods to prevent a crisis between France and Germany. At the same time, it is understood that both Britain and France have indirectly advised Germany to be more cautious. A certain report stated that France had called Germany's attention to the fact that Germany's repeated supply of arms and troops to the rebels had endangered peace. Semi-official sources denied this news, but indicated that Britain and France may have vaguely issued warnings during talks between the French and German ambassadors. It is claimed that France's attitude is very firm because French leaders seem to firmly believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini no longer wants to be Germany's backer in Spanish affairs. Tonight, the Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies unanimously passed two government proposals for loans to Poland: 40.5 million francs and 94.5 million francs for railway loans to the Polish government. This move will have a significant impact on Poland's return to the French diplomatic bloc. Italy today notified France that it is prepared to strictly maintain neutrality in Spain, provided that other countries take similar action. Italy will abide by any resolutions of the Non-Intervention Committee. However, Italian officials also insist that Soviet Russia's aid to the leftist forces must cease, according to a Guomin Daily dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(London) Europe today is deeply concerned that events of a warlike nature may disrupt the Christmas spirit. All parties fear that Germany may seize the opportunity to take decisive action regarding the Spanish Civil War or Czechoslovakia. On Wednesday, Dow Jones bonds on the London market fell to their lowest prices of the year. At the same time, news from Paris reported that Britain and France may have indirectly advised Hitler to be more cautious regarding Spanish affairs. Well-informed sources in Berlin stated that the governments of Britain, France, and Germany have indeed begun these important discussions, which is why Hitler remained in Berlin during the holidays instead of going to Bavaria. It is understood that, judging from the tone of the talks, Hitler may accept a mutual guarantee treaty. However, Germany clearly has food shortages and general economic difficulties. All parties have reported that Germany has sent thousands of troops to Spain. Therefore, people generally fear that Germany is deeply colluding with the Spanish rebels and will provide large-scale assistance if it does not change its policies. However, it is difficult to predict how it can change its policies without losing face, according to a Guomin Daily dispatch on the 24th.</p>

<p>Madrid. According to a public announcement issued by General Miaja, commander of the government forces defending Madrid, since the last meeting of the League of Nations on December 2, it is estimated that 20,000 German troops have landed in Spain to assist the rebels. These troops are deployed on various front lines, especially on the Madrid front, where there are a total of 6,000 troops. German soldiers have recently clearly appeared in the Battle of Boadilla. However, so far the government forces have not captured any National Socialists. German infantry use tactics similar to those used in the European War, launching dense attacks. But the government forces command has prepared to deal with these tactics. Miaja also stated that there are many Italian soldiers among the rebels, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>(Berlin) Hitler's aide Hess's Christmas broadcast included special blessings to German warships off the Spanish coast and to German soldiers in Spain, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>
<p>It is reported that ten German-made aircraft departed from Larache in Spanish Morocco yesterday, flying to Cadiz in southern Spain to join the Nationalist air force, according to reports from Tangier's international neutral port. The air force base in Spanish Morocco, originally in Tetouan, will now be moved to Larache. Today, a batch of Moroccan native soldiers departed from Ceuta, crossing the sea to mainland Spain to assist in the war. The Nationalist authorities are actively recruiting native soldiers and paying half of the soldiers' monthly salaries to their families to support them. However, because the majority of soldiers have been out of contact since going to war, their families are extremely worried. Therefore, the recruitment of native soldiers is still extremely difficult, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>Madrid. Nationalist forces continued to shell the capital this afternoon. Several shells landed on the central street of Gran Via, injuring about ten pedestrians. Another shell landed near the Central Telephone Company building, but did not explode, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>

<p>Avila (in Nationalist hands). It is reported that Carlists from the Basque Autonomous Region and members of the Falangist Party's Longshirts are also joining the fighting on the Nationalist side. But up to now, this team resembles a kind of volunteer crusade, commanded directly by the leaders of each party, rather than appointed by the Nationalist authorities. General Franco, the head of the Nationalist government, has decided that these teams should be under the control of the Nationalist authorities in the future. Their members will be subject to military law and treated the same as ordinary soldiers, according to a Havas dispatch on the 25th.</p>

<p>(Berlin) The Berliner Tageblatt published an article by its Paris correspondent, presumably with the authorization of the authorities. The article stated that French Foreign Minister Delbos held talks with German Ambassador to France Welczeck yesterday, and the meeting was quite friendly. The two discussed methods to stop the Spanish Civil War, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news in "Paris Soir," Foreign Minister Delbos received German Ambassador to France Count Welczeck at the Foreign Ministry yesterday and told him that if German troops were to go to Spain to help the rebels, it would inevitably have a major impact. The newspaper added that although the meeting was exploratory in nature, Delbos made it clear that Germany's attitude on the Spanish issue was enough to influence the overall situation in Europe. It was also reported that German leader Hitler is currently vacationing in Berchtesgaden and will convene his confidants there in the middle of next week to make important decisions on Germany's policies for next year, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(Paris) Responsible parties have firmly denied that the French Army Chief of Staff, General Gamelin, told Army Minister Daladier that Germany's intervention in the Spanish Civil War is becoming increasingly serious and that France should implement precautions in the Pyrenees and Morocco, according to a Reuters dispatch on the 25th.</p>

<p>(Paris) After a German merchant ship was inspected and ordered to sail to Bilbao in northern Spain yesterday by a warship belonging to the Spanish government forces, "L'Ere Nouvelle" diplomatic correspondent Madame Tabouis commented, "This move clearly contradicts international law.

<p>Havana. After President Gómez was ruled by the Special Court of the Senate to be immediately removed from office, Vice President Laredo Bru immediately succeeded him as President in accordance with the Constitution, becoming the seventh President since the Cuban Revolution of 1933. President Laredo Bru was officially sworn in this afternoon. Members of the diplomatic corps and senior civil and military officials attended the ceremony, but Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista did not attend. During the inauguration, the military paid their respects and fired a 21-gun salute, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>Havana, Cuba. After the new President Laredo Bru took office, he immediately began to organize a new cabinet. The list of important cabinet members is as follows:</p>
<p>Prime Minister General Mondalvo, Minister of Defense Remas, Minister of Interior Laisia, Minister of Finance Mondria. The new Prime Minister General Mondalvo is a close friend of Army Chief of Staff Colonel Batista, but the rest of the cabinet members do not all belong to Batista's faction. Also, according to the Constitution, if the current President Laredo Bru resigns, General Mondalvo will succeed him, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here declared that the change of Cuban president will not raise the issue of the U.S. recognizing the new government. Because Laredo Bru's succession to the presidency this time followed the provisions of the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, the U.S. has no reason to object, according to a Havas dispatch on the 24th.</p>

<p>Domei Special Dispatch. Columbus discovered the American continent, a very well-known fact. No one denies this. However, Germany recently denied this claim, saying that the first discoverer of the American continent was a Norse Viking. Columbus only stole this pirate's map and made it happen. This claim was made by German historian Dr. Lang English. The doctor mentioned this in his recently published pamphlet, saying: "The world calls Columbus the discoverer of the American continent, which is actually a deception. At that time, there were Norse Vikings, with many followers, who made a living by robbing ships in the Pacific. After looting, they sailed far away to avoid the eyes and ears of the authorities. They happened to discover the American continent and made a map. Over time, this map was transferred to the hands of the Roman Pope's office. When the Pope examined this map, he asked Columbus for help. Columbus stole it and spent day and night recreating a map for his own navigation use. This is actually the basis for his success. It is also unbelievable that the world says Columbus was an Italian, born in Geneva. In fact, Columbus was a mixed-race person of Spanish and Jewish descent," (December 25).</p>

<h3 id="e52">Tianjin Public Security Bureau Dismantles Fake Recruitment Agency, Mastermind Zhang Xueqian on the Run, 14 Accomplices Arrested <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Zhang Xueqian, formerly a section chief of the Beiping Military Branch and a councilor of the 51st Army, a relative of Zhang Xueliang, had been living in Tianjin for nearly half a year since his retirement. Recently, he established a fake recruitment agency in the National Hotel in the French Concession of Tianjin and also set up a fake military headquarters in Hebei's Sanjing Road and Hedong's Fuxing Village. He secretly ordered his accomplices to recruit troops, and the name of his agency was "Commander-in-Chief's Office of the Northeast Army of the National Revolutionary Army." Zhang appointed himself as commander-in-chief and appointed fake division commanders such as Wang Tingxiang, Liu Bichen, and Ma Wu, with appointment letters issued up to number 762. There was also a fake commander-in-chief, Liu Yanbin, who specialized in activities in the war zone. It is reported that the majority of those recruited were scattered soldiers and vagrants from various parts of eastern Tianjin and along the Great Wall, and many bandits from Fengrun and Luanzhou were also absorbed. The figures are as follows: (1) Li Jiasan from Fengrun, with 1,600 men and 60% armed with guns; (2) Wu Xiangsan from Yutian, with 2,200 men and 70% armed with guns; (3) Chen Guobao from Luanxian, with 1,300 men and 50% armed with guns; (4) Zuo Fenglou from Guye, with 3,500 men and 60% armed with guns; (5) Li Shaoting from Changli, with 2,500 men and 50% armed with guns; (6) Xiao Meisheng from Qian'an, with 700 men and 50% armed with guns; (7) Caoshangfei from Funing, with 2,300 men and 70% armed with guns; (8) Liu Yuanhua from Zunhua, with 600 men and 50% armed with guns; (9) Huang Tianba from Linyu, with 280 men and 80% armed with guns; (10) Ma Wu from Leting, with 2,000 men and 80% armed with guns; (11) Ren Cheng from Qinhuangdao, with 3,600 men and 70% armed with guns. The total number of these fake troops is estimated to be around 40,000. However, it is unknown whether the reported figures were inflated for the purpose of extorting money. Zhang Xueqian's plan, as announced to the fake division and brigade commanders, was to use eastern Hebei as a base and then advance towards outside the pass, with a reward of 15,000 yuan for each county occupied. After the troops were recruited and counted, each person would be given an activity fee of five yuan. The Tianjin authorities had a slight inkling of this matter last week and had planned to arrest him, but because Zhang was a graduate of the Japanese Army Officer School and had many classmates in Tianjin, they asked people to intercede for him. The authorities had slowed down their intention to arrest him, but in recent days, they realized that his actions were not simple. Mayor Zhang Zizhong secretly ordered Public Security Bureau Chief Li Wentian to quickly arrest him to avoid harming the local area. At 5:00 PM on the 23rd, Wang Baoyuan, the leader of the Second Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with Zhao Chuntian, the director of the Seventh Precinct of the Fifth Sub-bureau, surrounded the fake military headquarters in Hedong's Fuxing Village and arrested Xu Yeqin, Cao Guirong, Li Yongshun, Liu Hanqing, Zhao Deyou, Li Kaiting, Yue Guangqi, Yao Zhenlin, Song Xingrui, Yu Guoqing, Yu Jintao, Li Jinduo, Xu Yonghe, and Zhang Yonglin, a total of fourteen people, as well as Xu's wife and Yao's wife, two people. They found a fake seal engraved with the words "Certain Army, Certain Division of the Fourth Group Army of the National Army," as well as two fake appointment letters, one issued by Wang Tingxiang, the fake commander of the First Division of the Third Army of the Fourth Group Army of the fake National Army, to Xu Yeqin and Cao Guirong. Xu's appointment letter was as the head of the division's martial arts team, and Cao's appointment letter was as the head of the First Regiment of the First Brigade of the division. In addition, there was a roster of the names, numbers of firearms, and locations of the various fake troops in the war zone reported by the fake commander-in-chief Liu Yanbin. The group of offenders was sent to the Public Security Bureau on the morning of the 24th, and the search for their accomplices is still underway. Zhang Xueqian himself is hiding in Ma Doctor's Hospital in the French Concession, using illness as a pretext to avoid leaving the hospital. Although the Public Security Bureau wants to arrest him, they cannot do so. The fake division commander Ma Wu was sent to Baoding to carry out activities and returned to Beiping the day before yesterday. A fake office has also been set up on West Chang'an Street in Beiping. The Tianjin authorities telegraphed the Beiping Public Security Bureau on the 24th to search and arrest him. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Japanese Ruffians and Traitors Active in Chaozhou, Military and Political Authorities Pay Attention to Prevention, Wang Jianmin Executed by Firing Squad After Arrest <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Chaozhou and Shantou area, bordering the sea and adjacent to Fujian Province, has seen Japanese ruffians frequently engaging in various activities, causing countless international disputes. According to accurate and detailed information, no less than 2,000 Japanese ruffians and traitors have infiltrated the interior of Chaozhou and Shantou. They do not fulfill household registration procedures, carry weapons without authorization, escort smuggled goods, or act as peddlers in the interior, spying on military intelligence and national defense deployments, photographing terrain, colluding with hooligans, and secretly forming societies. In Shantou City and Chaoyang City, people with foreign accents are often found inquiring about local security conditions from shops, but merchants uniformly refuse to answer. The Administrative Commissioner's Office believes that the ruffians have ulterior motives and must be strictly prevented. It has telegraphed the mayors and magistrates of various counties, requiring that if anyone rents a house in urban or rural shops and homes, the owners and co-residents should be required to fill in their nationality, name, occupation, number of residents, and place of origin, and report to the local government, police station, or autonomous public office, obtain a shop guarantee, and complete the procedures before being allowed to move in. If anyone falsely claims to be Chinese and moves in or engages in business, the Public Security Bureau should refuse to issue a license. If any civilians deliberately violate this rule, they will be severely punished once discovered or reported, in order to maintain security. Military police in various counties have tightened security in recent days, checking passing boats and vehicles, and armed sentries are stationed at key transportation points. After nightfall, anyone without a lantern is not allowed to pass. Hotels, inns, and public places are subject to particularly strict inspections to prevent the disruption of traitors. A certain Gao, the leader of the ruffians, used to summon intelligence personnel from various places to Shantou every Saturday and Sunday for two hours of training, guiding their central work. Those who attended the training always walked there on time, without taking cars, nodding on the road, talking, or traveling in groups of three. Since the Xi'an Incident, there has been a meeting almost every other day. Around 7:00 AM in the morning, they would leave one after another, each carrying a floral cloth towel, containing cameras and other items, and go to Chenghai, Chao'an, Chaoyang, and other inland areas (places that can be reached and returned from in one day). Because they either falsely claim to be relatives, are recruited as sons-in-law by poor women, or become friends with party leaders and local bullies, and live in the study rooms or residences of important people in the countryside, doing certain work, their actions are all outside the cordon. For example, Wang Jianmin, the secretary of the Chenghai Party Committee, the former provincial senator, controlled the party departments and autonomous organizations at all levels in the county, and usually oppressed the people, used the party for personal gain, secretly colluding with ruffians, packing and transporting smuggled goods, and willingly acted as a traitor. Wang's accomplices were numerous and spread throughout various key locations. Deng Longguang and Li Hanhun, the commanders of the stationed army divisions, had heard about this for a long time. Recently, Wang's activities became increasingly rampant, colluding with party members in various counties, forming a traitorous group, and providing our military and political information and intelligence data to the ruffians. After Li Hanhun confirmed the facts, he ordered Lin Yan, the regiment commander of the stationed army in Chenghai, to arrest Wang. Wang confessed to colluding with foreign merchants to smuggle goods without denying it. On the 15th, Li had Wang executed by firing squad as a warning to the public. All traitors were terrified, resigned from important positions, and fled. The ruffian organization suffered a fundamental blow.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Guangdong Province Develops Transportation Industry, Construction Department Rushes to Build Major Highways in the Northeast Region, Telecommunications Bureau Unifies Long-Distance Telephone Services in Various Counties <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province is urgently developing its transportation industry, and is actively constructing both roads and telecommunications. Currently, the county highways, in addition to the two trunk lines in the eastern region and one trunk line in the southern region, the cross-county roads connecting the various trunk lines have not yet been completed. The first trunk line in the eastern region runs from Guangzhou to Huiyang, and from Huiyang through Huilai and other counties to Shantou; the second trunk line runs from Huizhou, Heyuan, Xingning to Meixian; and the southern trunk line runs from Siyi, through Liangyang, into Gaozhou, and connects to the Qinlian Road. Recently, the Construction Department, in order to improve northeast transportation, decided to build the Wengyuan to Conghua highway and the Conghua to Xinfeng highway in the short term, so that it is possible to reach the North River directly from the eastern region without passing through Guangzhou. The department has sent personnel to survey the routes of the above two roads, and the survey has been completed. As soon as the construction funds are allocated, construction can begin. As for the Shao-Lian Road (i.e., from Shaozhou to Lianxian), which runs from the North River through the Little North River to the Guibian area, it is also planned to be built. After a survey was conducted, the entire line is 340 miles long, and most of the areas along the way are rural, so the construction should not be difficult. However, the estimated construction cost is also more than 900,000 yuan. The Construction Department has already reviewed the budget and drawings, and construction can begin in the short term.</p>
<p>Regarding telecommunications, the Ministry of Communications recently decided to reorganize the plan, and the management of wired and wireless communications has gradually been unified. However, the long-distance telephone services of the various county mayors were originally managed independently, either by the government or by merchants, and the systems were not connected. Although connections between counties have been made over the years, it has not yet become a provincial transportation network. Recently, in order to implement the management of long-distance telephone services throughout the province, the Telecommunications Administration Bureau has sent a commissioner to Shantou to take over the long-distance telephone services operated by merchants in Shantou. In the future, the long-distance telephone services in various counties under the jurisdiction of the Construction Department, such as the Guangzhou-Shantou long-distance telephone line in the eastern region, the Guangzhou-Huiyang line, the Guangzhou-Qingyuan Huaxian line in the central region, and the Guangzhou-Shaozhou line in the northern region, will also be transferred to the management of the Telecommunications Bureau. After the long-distance telephone services throughout the province are unified, it is planned to establish a long-distance telephone central station in Guangzhou and branch stations in various counties. The estimated reorganization cost is 4.5 million yuan. It is said that this telecommunications construction cost has been included in the provincial budget for the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937]. As for wired communications, efforts are also being stepped up to connect with neighboring provinces, such as the eastern region line connecting with Fujian Province, and the northwest region line connecting with Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi. Recently, the wired telegraph from Guangzhou to Changsha has been reorganized, and telegrams can now be sent directly, which is much more convenient than having to be relayed through other places.

<p>The cooperative societies in various townships of this county borrowed 30,000 yuan from the China and Farmers Banks on Shanghai's Avenue Edward VII this spring for farmers to purchase fertilizer. The repayment of loans after the autumn harvest was successful and deeply satisfied the banks. As winter approaches, farmers have requested continued loans for the purchase of plowing cattle, piglets, bean cakes, and other necessities. The China Agricultural Bank of Shanghai has agreed to lend 50,000 yuan, and the contract will be signed within days. In addition, cooperative societies in this county have made rapid progress this year. Currently, more than 20 locations, such as Gaojiaqiao and Jujiayouche, have initiated organizations, and 18 locations, such as Daguzhai and Fujiazhai, have been approved for registration by the provincial government.</p>

<p>Liu Yulin, a policeman from the Sixth Precinct of the First Public Security Bureau, and five accomplices went to Hu A'qiao's house at No. 3 Jingxiang at 11:00 PM the night before, claiming to be investigating opium. They intimidated him with guns, arbitrarily rummaged through boxes and chests, and took away 30 yuan in legal tender. Afterwards, the victim learned that they were falsely claiming to be investigating opium. On the afternoon of the 24th, the victim, Hu Fengshi, encountered Liu Yulin near Xuanmiao Temple, immediately grabbed him, reported to the police, and took him to the Third Precinct of the Second Sub-bureau. Inspector Liang escorted the Liu suspect to his home at No. 89 Ganjiangfang and searched it, and then escorted him to the sub-bureau, which transferred him to the main bureau. Director Zhang was greatly angered by this case, considering that the policeman was acting like a bandit, and will send him to the Military Police Inspection Office for strict punishment.</p>

<p>Suzhou Chunyi Middle School was founded by the Lei family, owners of Lei Yunshang Pharmacy, and has been in operation for sixteen years, with over 1,000 students. It is one of the leading private schools in Suzhou. The school principal was Peng Jiazhi, who had served for fifteen years without change. During the summer vacation this year, Gao Runzhong was replaced as principal, so that teachers and staff were greatly mobilized during the autumn semester. Therefore, there was internal strife between the old and the new, and students also had the so-called Peng supporters and Gao supporters, the situation is very complicated. Recently, slogans calling for the expulsion of the principal were found in the school, and disturbances have repeatedly occurred. It is rumored that a part of the students expressed dissatisfaction with the school teacher Zheng Ziyun, and the school's academic director Chen Xulun also resigned. After the Jiangsu Education Department was secretly informed, it sent Zhang Zhukun to Suzhou to investigate. After Zhang arrived in Suzhou, he went to the school to investigate and gave a speech to the students. The truth about the disturbances is already clear, and he returned to the province yesterday to report.</p>

<p>The Gan Da Ba Candle Shop outside the North Gate of this county, in the Tan Tou Alley, also sells "Cough Jindan" medicine, which is specially used for treating coughs. It is wholesaled from Yuyao, Zhejiang. Recently, someone suddenly reported to the Administrative Commissioner's Office that the Jindan contains morphine, a poisonous substance. After receiving the report, the Commissioner's Office immediately ordered the Third Public Security Bureau to chemically test the Jindan. It was confirmed to contain poisonous substances. The shop's clerk, Qiu Xirong, was taken to the bureau and presented to the main bureau, which transferred him to the county government for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, the city and county governments jointly sent him to the Second District Security Command for interrogation.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Changshu: Planning to Build a New County Government <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Civil and criminal litigation cases here are increasing daily, and there is an urgent need to establish a local court. However, there is no suitable location for the Changshu Court, which has caused delays. Now, the Jiangsu High Court has subsidized 35,000 yuan to purchase the current county government building to be used as a court. As for the county government building, it has been decided to rebuild the Shimei Library. The library will be moved to the new park outside the North Gate. This decision has been largely finalized. The court is scheduled to be established on March 1, and all are proceeding with the original plan. As for the library issue, opinions from all sides consider that the new park is too far north, and the location on the mountainside is difficult to manage. The general opinion is that after the merger of the middle school's girls' department, the library should be moved to the Dushutai (Reading Terrace). The location is very suitable, and it also conforms to the historical site of Zhaoming's Dushutai. It is still under discussion.</p>

<p>The Dahua steamer of the Shanghai Baohua Steamer Bureau, which operates between Shanghai and Haimen, left Haimen for Shanghai at around 12:00 PM on the 22nd, carrying 64 passengers and hundreds of pieces of cargo. At 4:00 AM on the 23rd, when the ship was passing the waters of Huangfengzui in Shuangqigang, Liuhong Island, Dinghai, due to thin fog, the visibility was low. The driver, for caution's sake, sailed along Liuhong Island by foot. Unexpectedly, it hit the foot of Huangfeng Mountain, causing one-third of the ship's body to run aground on the foot of the mountain and unable to move. The shipowner hurriedly called for help. At that time, the Nanhai steamer passed by, and hearing the sound, suspected it was a robbery and did not dare to approach immediately, so it anchored and waited. At around 7:00 AM, the tide receded and the sky cleared, revealing the truth. Then it went forward and rescued the Dahua passengers into its own ship. Hong, the Dahua's purser, took the Nanhai to Zhenhai and reported to the Foreign Water Police to send a team to protect it, to prevent pirates from looting. The Dahua steamer could only get out of danger when the tide rose.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Random Jottings of a European Journey <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— By Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Europe, Lieshan</p>
<p>I. Different Views</p>
<p>It is said that during his time in Germany, Dai Jitao, the President of the Examination Yuan, conducted an on-the-ground investigation of the current situation in Germany, visiting many cities. Once, when traveling to a certain city, the mayor and the local National Socialist Party branch, as usual, hosted a banquet to welcome Mr. Dai as an honored guest. During the banquet, Mr. Dai stood up and gave a speech, half for diplomatic courtesy and half because the achievements of Germany in recent years were indeed worthy of admiration by foreign guests (especially the national defense plan). Therefore, it was naturally unavoidable to say a few words in favor of Germany. Unexpectedly, the next day, the German newspaper recorded the following passage: "(Mr. Dai said) You Germans have given us a model, and we Chinese are very grateful... Our leader Chiang Kai-shek is emulating your leader Hitler..."</p>
<p>I remember a Chinese classmate studying in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, who was usually a good-tempered man, suddenly had a small conflict with a German one day, eventually arguing until they were red in the face. Afterwards, he told the reporter, "Look, isn't this outrageous? Just now that German student actually said to me that what China lacks is a Hitler, saying that our Chiang Kai-shek should learn from their leader Hitler. In fact, our Chiang Kai-shek's talent and ability are many times higher than their Hitler. How many difficult things are there in China? Let Hitler try it. This is simply an insult to us. Our Chiang Kai-shek should learn from their Hitler."</p>
<p>Naturally, different people have different views.</p>
<p>II. Who is China's Greatest Modern Diplomat?</p>
<p>"Weak countries have no diplomacy," but a friend who specializes in international politics used the question "Who is China's greatest modern diplomat?" to make things difficult for me. I said, "Friend, the history of China's modern diplomacy is a history of national disasters. Although we are unwilling to judge heroes by success or failure, but!"</p>
<p>He told me, "If I want to find such a figure in the history of Chinese diplomacy or in the diplomatic world, then my time would be wasted." I said, "He must be outside the history of diplomacy and the diplomatic world," he replied.</p>
<p>In my opinion, there are only two greatest diplomats in modern China. It is hard to say that they are not diplomats, but unfortunately they are both dead: Sun Yat-sen and Hu Hanmin. When Mr. Sun was passing through Japan, the Japanese invited him to give a speech on Pan-Asianism. He did not forget that he was a Chinese. He told the Japanese audience that the premise of Pan-Asianism was whether Japan wanted to Europeanize itself like Europe, or return to Asia and follow China! This has the air of a diplomat. When Mr. Hu was in Moscow, the Communists held a large meeting to welcome him. There was a slogan in the meeting place: "From Sun Yat-senism to Leninism." After Mr. Hu saw it, he immediately said on the spot: "This slogan should be reversed, from Leninism to Sun Yat-senism." Then he explained his views. Talking about Leninism with the Communists in Moscow is a diplomat's courage!</p>
<p>This friend continued, "Diplomats certainly need to have social skills, but people who only have social skills are at most only fit to be embassy staff members."</p>
<p>III. Guo Taiqi's Clever Remark</p>
<p>When the Chinese legation in Britain was promoted to an embassy, the first ambassador, Mr. Guo Taiqi, in accordance with diplomatic practice, had to present his credentials to the King of England. Britain is a country that loves antiques, not only respecting the customs of the days of the old grandmothers, especially the royal etiquette. There is not much difference between the twentieth century and the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The young Edward VIII, since childhood, received this kind of family education, and in his dealings with diplomats from other countries, he would not forget the ancestral set of ceremonies. It is said that the King of England also used the old custom at that time, and when presenting the credentials, he said to Mr. Guo: "I have heard that in recent years your country's relations with Japan are not good, and I am worried about it. Our country hopes for world peace, and I hope that your country and Japan can be friendly in the future..." This was reminiscent of the style of a large country's monarch.</p>
<p>This was naturally a difficult problem for Mr. Guo. How to answer? In this solemn situation, how could he discuss the rights and wrongs between China and Japan with the King of England? He only replied coldly, "Fortunately, our China is still large!" Mr. Guo did not laugh when he said this, but Edward VIII, and even the former Foreign Secretary Simon, a most British "cold and colder" figure, finally couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>IV. British Home Secretary Simon</p>
<p>The current British Home Secretary Simon is the leader of the right-wing national faction in the Liberal Party. During the Northeast Incident, he was the Foreign Secretary. It is said that he was responsible for the fact that the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Japan at that time were unable to be consistent. Later, he was transferred to Home Secretary due to the Italian-Ethiopian affair. Home Secretary Simon is a famous British legal expert. Although his political life has been smooth sailing, he does not seem to have become a figure generally loved by the people, especially in the Parliament, where he is often the target of attacks by the opposition. For example, when Prime Minister Baldwin announced the appointment of the Home Secretary in Parliament, a Labor Party member in the House of Commons immediately stood up and questioned the Prime Minister in front of Simon, asking whether the Prime Minister specifically asked him to try his hand at domestic affairs because Simon's handling of foreign affairs had failed!</p>
<p>Home Secretary Simon, although a typical British gentleman, the opposition did not show any concern for this. Therefore, his experience in Parliament was more pitiful than that of other politicians. I remember that in July of this year, when the British House of Commons debated the new law on unemployed workers, Home Secretary Simon also made a speech defending the government. At that time, a Labor Party member suddenly stood up and interrupted his speech, pointing at him and saying, "The Home Secretary is lying." Later, although this member was punished with expulsion, it also aroused the indignation of several Labor Party and Liberal Party members. They loudly told Simon, "We all know that the Home Secretary is a famous liar." Another said, "Everyone knows that you are the most vulgar liar!"</p>
<p>Naturally, this was somewhat of an insult. Even with the political status of the Home Secretary, he could still not resist the opposition, this is the British parliamentary system.</p>
<p>V. Cleverness Overreached</p>
<p>The British are famous for being polite. Chinese people who come to London for the first time will always receive warnings from "old Londoners." The British never like to say bad things about others. Therefore, we Chinese should also return the courtesy and never criticize British things. Remember, even if things are bad, you have to say they are good. For example, on a cloudy day when it is about to rain, you should also say that it is good weather. This is gentlemanly enough!</p>
<p>Once, several Chinese students went to visit a school in a certain British industrial area. Because of the many factories in that area, it has always been known for being unsanitary in Britain, and this school was naturally no exception. When the principal of the school received them, he first apologized to the visitors, saying that the area was very unclean because of the industrial area. The Chinese students at that time did not forget the British gentlemanly courtesy and quickly replied, "Not at all, it is very clean here!" This, in turn, made the principal feel confused. He thought, if the Chinese thought a place like this was very clean, then the daily life of the Chinese people can be imagined!</p>
<p>Not learning to be a gentleman, China ended up suffering instead.</p>

The authorities of this city specially held a commemoration meeting in the Great Hall of the headquarters at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Xing Wan was the chairman, Du Mengsen was the recorder, and Zhang Hanyun was the master of ceremonies. The following is a record of the opening meeting:</p>
<p>Venue Arrangement</p>
<p>The venue was set in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters. The party and national flags and a white cloth banner were hung in front of the gate, with the words "Shanghai All-Circles Representatives Hold Yunnan Uprising 21st Anniversary Commemoration Meeting" written on it. The national flag, party flag, and the portrait of the Prime Minister were hung in the center of the hall. Order slogans were posted on both sides, and slogans were posted all over the four walls. The atmosphere was very solemn.</p>
<p>Representatives Present</p>

<p>Opening Ceremony</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Chairman Xing Wan gave a report, stating: "Yuan Shikai not only destroyed the law and dissolved the Kuomintang, but also dissolved the parliament. After the assassination of Song Jiaoren, the party attempted to overthrow Yuan Shikai, but unfortunately failed. However, this claim was not abandoned and continued to struggle. As a result of the arrangements in various parties, twenty-one years ago today, the Yunnan Uprising was launched to crusade against Yuan Shikai. Yunnan comrades urged Tang Jiyao to denounce, and Cai E and others were appointed to lead troops north. On the 23rd, a telegram was sent to Yuan Shikai to punish the thirteen culprits. Yuan ignored it. Therefore, on the 25th, a declaration was issued to launch an expedition. The provinces responded one after another, which shows that Yuan was not tolerated by the Republic of China. Today's commemoration should recognize the following three points: (1) Revolutionary power is built on the psychology of the masses. If there is a violation, it will fail. For example, Cao Kun's bribery election and the rampant warlords were eventually eliminated. Recently, public opinion has sought domestic unity. If this fact is violated, it will be difficult to survive. The same is true for the Fujian People's Government and the Liangguang issue. Recently, Zhang Xueliang's rebellion in Xi'an detained Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, which violated the national public opinion, not only undermined unity, but also destroyed the outline. At the time of the victorious suppression of bandits in Suiyuan, it was infinitely affected by Zhang Xueliang. If it is not wiped out, it cannot be unified, the outline cannot be rectified, and the nation cannot be revived. (2) The Yunnan Uprising was a great cause of overthrowing the monarchy and rebuilding the Republic of China, and at the same time seeking the implementation of the Three Principles of the People. What our country needs now is a national front. Other doctrines and so-called people's fronts are not in line with national conditions and society. Promoting the people's front, as the name implies, is in opposition to the government and will never succeed. (2) Yuan Shikai's proclaiming himself emperor was Yuan's ambition, but it was also because some comrades in the party could not listen to the commander's instructions, which led to the weakness of the revolutionary forces and the arrogance of the feudal forces. Yuan Shikai took the opportunity to proclaim himself emperor. In order to punish the past and be cautious, we must support the leader and obey the leader. This is a necessary condition at present. This time, the leader suffered in Xi'an, and we used the power of the entire nation to welcome and implement the established national policy."</p>
<p>Flying Flags on Alert</p>
<p>Yesterday was a national memorial day. All agencies, organizations, schools, and various departments in this city, in addition to sending representatives to participate in the commemoration meeting convened by the Party Headquarters and flying flags to commemorate, all remained open as usual and did not take a holiday. The Garrison Command, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the police stations of the two concessions, in view of the current period of martial law, strengthened their defenses and vigilance.</p>

<p>Regarding the income tax on deposit interest, research committees from both the banking and money industries have conducted separate research and exchanged views with members of both associations. Now, after referring to the opinions of various banking and money industry associations and member banks and shops, a report has been drafted. It has been decided to hold another joint meeting of the two associations before the end of the month to submit it for approval and then submit it to the Ministry of Finance for contribution. However, regarding the income tax on deposits in foreign banks in China, it is hoped that it will be levied at the same time as Chinese banks and money shops. As for various money shops, except for Fuyuan and others, they all use the old-style accounting system. It has now been decided to uniformly switch to the new-style accounting system starting next year to facilitate calculation.</p>

<p>The He'an liner of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau and the Lixin liner of the Lixin Shipping Bureau, which specialize in sailing small inland river liners from Shanghai to Huzhou and Qian, were robbed on the morning of the 23rd while sailing from Lake to Shanghai when they reached Zhujia浜, 15 miles away from Yuhui. The total loss was approximately 500 yuan. The industry association has cabled for strict apprehension. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>He'an Encounter The He'an liner of the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau sailed from Huzhou with cargo and passengers at 10:00 AM on the 23rd. At 10:30 PM, it reached Zhujia浜, 15 miles away from Yuhui, when 16 robbers speaking Jiangbei and Shanghai accents, traveling on boats, fired shots to force it to stop. The captain was forced to stop the liner under duress. The robbers, armed with rifles and pistols, rushed onto the liner and robbed the 50-plus passengers, resulting in a total loss of over 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Lixin Affected The Lixin liner of the Lixin Shipping Bureau sailed from Huzhou with cargo and passengers at noon on the 23rd, towing a pleasure boat. At 12:00 AM, it reached Zhujia浜, where the captain saw the He'an liner docked. Initially, he thought it was due to mechanical failure, so he continued to move forward as usual, resulting in being robbed as well. The passengers lost approximately 150 yuan. As for the three Westerners in the pleasure boat, the four shotguns they were carrying were also robbed.</p>
<p>Report to Water Police At 1:00 AM on the 24th, the robbers, having looted to their satisfaction, left in their original boats. Afterwards, the captains of the He'an and Lixin liners jointly reported to the Yuhui Water Police Team, requesting them to quickly send police to pursue and apprehend the robbers. When the police arrived, the robbers had already fled far away without a trace. Thereupon, the He'an and Lixin liners continued to sail to Shanghai as usual. The He'an arrived in Shanghai at 11:00 AM, and the Lixin arrived at 4:00 PM. The captains of both liners immediately reported the robbery to the Shanghai Bureau. On the afternoon of the 25th, they sailed to Lake as usual according to schedule.</p>
<p>Cables for Strict Apprehension Furthermore, the Hengji liner of the China Merchants Inland River Bureau and the Licheng liner of the Lixin Shipping Bureau sailed from Shanghai to Lake on the same day. Fortunately, they were not robbed when passing through Zhujia浜 and arrived safely in Huzhou. As for the Inland River Liner Industry Association, after receiving reports from members of the Li and Ju Bureaus, it has cabled the water police of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, urging them to quickly take measures for strict apprehension and send police to protect the shipping, so as to maintain transport and ensure the safety of passengers.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Shanghai's First Warehouse Opens Today; Tea and Refreshments Served for Visitors; Interior Facilities Well-Equipped <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The South Shanghai City Warehouse, built by the Shanghai Public Works Bureau, has been completed. The opening ceremony will be held at 2:00 PM on the 26th, with invitations for visitors from all sectors. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Warehouse</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, considering that the South Shanghai area lacked a scientific warehouse, which caused inconvenience for stacking goods, began designing and building the city's first warehouse in the first half of last year. After selecting the location at the intersection of Xinmatou Street, outside the 16th Pier in South Shanghai, construction began in June of this year. After several months of continuous progress, the project has recently been completed.</p>
<p>Interior Facilities</p>
<p>As for the warehouse, being Shanghai's first warehouse, it is divided into five floors, built with steel and reinforced concrete. Each floor has an area of 11,600 square feet, with a total capacity of 5,000 tons. The total construction cost is 210,000 yuan in national currency. The interior facilities include an elevator that can carry a load of two tons, automatic fire extinguishers, automatic fire doors, unloading machines, etc., which are quite well-equipped. A ten-year contract has been signed with Minsheng Industrial Company for its use.</p>
<p>Invitation Today</p>
<p>The warehouse project was contracted by Dong Ruihe Construction Company. After starting construction in June of this year, it has now been completed. The Municipal Public Works Bureau has specifically invited visitors from all sectors for today (the 26th), sending out invitation cards that read: "The South Shanghai City Warehouse has now been completed. We invite visitors from all sectors to visit at 2:00 PM on Saturday, December 26th. We will prepare tea and refreshments and await your presence. Xu Peixiang. The location is No. 53, Matou Road, South of Maojia Alley, South Shanghai. Admission by invitation."</p>
<h3 id="e102">On the Shanghai-Hankou Section of the Yangtze River, Water Levels Rise Again; A Shoal is Discovered at Madang; All River Steamers Must Detour; Yesterday's Draft Limit: Seventeen Feet <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that the water volume in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River is gradually rising again, and Shanghai-Hankou river steamers can navigate without obstruction. However, in the upper reaches of Chongqing and the middle reaches of Yichang, water levels are still falling, indicating shallowness and drought. A Datong News Agency reporter inquired with the Customs Maritime Department yesterday to learn about the situation, which is recorded below:</p>
<p>River Water Rises Again</p>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, which inquired yesterday with the Jianghai Customs Maritime Department, the water level along the Shanghai-Hankou section of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has gradually risen again. The water level in Hankou yesterday was already seven feet (the lowest level a few days ago was just over three feet); the water level in Jiujiang was measured at nine feet nine inches; the water level in Anqing was measured at eight feet three inches; and the water level in Wuhu was measured at five feet three inches (the lowest level a few days ago was just over two feet).</p>
<p>Navigation is Unobstructed</p>
<p>Regarding the draft limit for the Shanghai-Hankou section, the Maritime Department announced yesterday that it is seventeen feet three inches for the Wuhu to Jiujiang section, and fifteen feet nine inches for the Jiujiang to Hankou section. Therefore, river steamers traveling to and from Wusong to Hankou can now navigate without obstruction, to the delight of shipping merchants. However, the Customs received a report yesterday on the water level in Yichang in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, which has receded to only inches. The water level in Chongqing in the upper reaches is also becoming shallower day by day, so navigation in the middle and upper reaches is on the verge of being suspended.</p>
<p>Shoal Discovered</p>
<p>The Maritime Department has discovered a shoal in the Madang Channel, and navigation must detour around it. A notice was issued yesterday afternoon stating: "A shoal has been discovered at the lower end of the Mafu Channel in the Jiujiang section. Its position is one and a half nautical miles above the Quan Yuzhou lighthouse and one chain away from the right bank. The depth of the water above the shoal is 8.5 feet higher than the Jiujiang water level." Navigation guidance: Maintain a distance of one chain from the bank, pass through the Quanxingzhou lighthouse, and then gradually turn the helm outwards, maintaining a distance of one and a half chains from the right bank.</p>

<p>The Defeng Chicken and Duck Company at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi was robbed by four bandits on the morning of the day before yesterday, suffering significant losses. Police and bandits exchanged gunfire on the scene, and three bandits were captured. One bandit, named Zhang Arong, was shot in the right leg. Later, he pried open the wooden fence at the location and fled towards Dada Lane. Coincidentally, Tang Fusheng, a platoon leader of the South District Defense Corps headquarters, passed by and saw this, so he bravely stepped forward and captured him with his bare hands, seizing a pistol with serial number 5748. He handed him over to the police for interrogation. Yesterday, four male and female bandits were apprehended. The pursuit and investigation of accomplices is currently underway.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Yin Bengen Assassination Case Still Unable to Open Debate; Because the Case is Exceptionally Complex; Witnesses Must Be Summoned for Further Interrogation <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Yin Bengen, a native of Anhui who formerly served as a detective in the French Concession police, was assassinated on the night of October 1st this year in front of the home of Shao Wang at No. 168 Wujia Lane, Jiatang, on the border of the French Concession. The French Concession police have now arrested the suspects, Wang Dianhua (also known as Wang Laowu), Wu Weicai, the woman Sun Ergu, and eleven other suspects. After being transferred to the Special Second Court for investigation, eight people who were found to be unrelated were requested to be released. Wang, Wu, and Sun Ergu were requested to be indicted after an extended period of investigation. Subsequently, it was clarified that Sun Ergu was not involved, and she was released without indictment. Wang Dianhua and Wu Weicai were indicted for aiding and abetting murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. Wang also confessed that he went with Wang Fufu and Ma Changfu, who are currently at large, to kill Yin. The court ordered a postponement to appoint lawyers for debate and further review. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Gangxu and Prosecutor Wang Ren came to the Second Criminal Court to continue interrogating the two defendants, Wang and Wu. After being indicted, they were transferred to the detention center. Therefore, during this interrogation, both Wang and Wu reversed their testimonies and denied everything, repeatedly claiming innocence and stating that their previous confessions were due to unbearable torture by the police, and they had no choice but to confess, requesting a detailed investigation. Wang also claimed that he was a close friend of the deceased, who ate and slept at his home. If he wanted to kill him, everyone in his family could have done it; why would he have to harm him at Qianjiatang? On the night of the incident, he went with Yin to the home of Shao Wang at Yinjia Tang. Yin played mahjong, and he watched for about an hour. Because his wife was sick, he went home. If he had murdered Yin, wouldn't he have moved and fled? How could he still live in the same place? Wu also denied plotting to kill Yin. Sun Ergu confessed that she had had an affair with Yin Bengen and did not know Wang Laowu. Furthermore, Wu Liaoxiang, a native of Anhui who was Sun Ergu's former lover and is currently serving a four-year and two-month sentence for theft, testified that he did not know Yin Bengen or Wang Laowu. He stated that he did not know if Yin had informed on him, leading to his case. Shao Wang testified that the mahjong game at her house had already ended that night. The deceased fled to her house, and a short person chased in, dragged the deceased out to the door, and then the defendant Wang Diansan opened fire. She said that Wang was wearing a long black gown and a hat resembling a copper basin. She saw his face clearly, but she did not see the short person's face clearly. The court reviewed the testimonies and determined that the case was complex and could not open for debate. The court ordered a postponement to 2:00 PM on the 31st for further interrogation, and also instructed the police to find Shao Wang and the other mahjong players who were there that night to testify.</p>
<h3 id="e105">News from the Courts: Shi Liang is Still in Shanghai; Lawyers Tang and Zhang Cannot Find Her; Requesting the Court's Guidance <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shi Liang, a female lawyer who was arrested at the same time as Shen Junru, Wang Zao Shi, Sha Qianli, Li Gongpu, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Tao fen, and six others, left Shanghai and went into hiding after being released on bail from the Third Branch of the High Court and has not yet returned. The Procuratorate of the Special Second Court has repeatedly summoned lawyers Tang Hao and Zhang Zhirang, who were responsible for guaranteeing her release, to court for questioning, and ordered them to pay a cash guarantee of 500 yuan each, with a deadline to find Shi and bring her to court. Lawyers Tang and Zhang have placed advertisements in the newspapers three times, urging Shi to surrender as soon as possible. Lawyer Tang Hao also went to Suzhou to search for her, but without any news. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the Chief Prosecutor of the Special Third Court opened a hearing to summon lawyers Tang and Zhang, who appeared on time. The official asked, "Is Shi Liang in court today?" Tang Hao replied, "After the last adjournment, because Lawyer Zhang had matters in Shanghai, I went to Suzhou on Monday. I first inquired at the High Court, but there was no trace of Shi. Then I went to the Hengjie Detention Center in Wuxian County, which is where Shen Junru and the six others are currently detained. There is no women's detention center there, so I went to the High Court Detention Center on Siqian Street to inquire, but Shi Liang was not there either. I then went to find No. 80 Guanqian Street, which turned out to be the Zhongnan Bank, not a shop or residence. There was nothing to be found. I returned to Shanghai and discussed it with Lawyer Zhang, and we placed another advertisement in the newspaper, urging Shi to surrender. So far, there is still no news. We also very much hope that Shi will return to court as soon as possible to fulfill our responsibility." He presented a copy of the newspaper as evidence. Lawyer Zhang Zhirang stated, "We received a letter last time saying that she could come to court in a week, but she has not yet surrendered. We have tried our best to find her, but it is difficult to meet with her." The official said, "According to the court's investigation, Shi Liang is in Shanghai and has not left. Do you have any way to urge Shi to come to court? Otherwise, this court will also find it difficult to see you." Lawyers Tang and Zhang replied, "We have used all possible methods. If the court has any method, please guide us so that we can proceed accordingly." As a result, the court ordered Tang and Zhang to remain under the original guarantee, pending further review.</p>

<p>Ms. Zhang Zhenhe, a female teacher at the Affiliated Middle School of National Jinan University in Zhenru, is from Hefei, Anhui. Recently, due to setbacks in her love life, she lost all hope. Around noon yesterday, she secretly swallowed sleeping pills in her dormitory, intending to commit suicide. She immediately lay down on her bed and did not get up. Towards dusk, moaning sounds were heard coming from her room. Several female students entered the room and, seeing the situation, were greatly alarmed. They urgently hired a car to take her to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. It is reported that she had taken too many drugs and her life is in extremely critical condition. As for the truth of her emotional distress, those who accompanied her are keeping it secret, so it is impossible to find out.</p>

<p>Dong Bingrong, a 46-year-old native of Zhenjiang, was employed as a cook at the home of Ms. Lin Huizhen, a gynecologist from Fujian, at No. 1412, Lane 2, Xiafei Road. At 7:20 PM the day before yesterday, while cooking in the kitchen, Dong became poisoned by the coal stove due to the strong heat, and he felt a headache, fainted, and fell to the ground.

The next day, the Special Second Court was notified, and Prosecutor Wang Ren came to the office to examine the body, confirming that he had died from coal gas poisoning.

<p>On the Western side, consulates, organizations, schools, banks, and shops of various countries in Shanghai were closed yesterday and the day before. Chinese and foreign Christians gathered in churches everywhere yesterday morning to hold solemn Christmas worship services. Christmas worship is one of the four major worship services of the Catholic Church. At the Jiangxi Road Catholic Church, the Mulhall Church on Sanma Road, the Baptist Church on Minguo Road, the Catholic Church on Xiafei Road, and St. Peter's Church on Avenue Haig, the bishops and pastors gave sermons during the worship service. Believers from all over came to listen. The bells rang loudly, and hymns were sung in accompaniment. The solemn and enthusiastic scene was no less than in previous years.</p>
<p>Singing and Dancing All Night, Revelry Until Dawn</p>
<p>All entertainment venues in the city, such as cinemas, dance halls, and bars, were packed on this once-a-year Christmas holiday, and business was booming. All large and small dance halls were specially permitted by the concession authorities to remain open all night on the previous two days. In order to attract business, they also prepared free gifts such as toy paper hats. As a result, Christmas gifts and various toys in companies and shops were twice as profitable. Major hotels such as the Cathay, International, Lido, Grand Cathay, Paramount, and Racecourse Hotel had special musical programs to entertain guests. Amidst the melodious music, the scent of perfume and the gleam of hairpins, the shadows of dancers swayed. The light of jewelry and dresses intertwined. People enjoyed themselves all day long and reveled until dawn, forgetting the urgency of the world's situation, as if they were in a prosperous age. Looking back on the past, I am deeply moved.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration previously added special express passenger trains between Shanghai and Wuxi on Sundays, starting from October 25th of this year, in order to facilitate tourists visiting the Suzhou and Wuxi areas. Since the start of the service, passengers have praised it. Now, the Railway Administration has announced that its newly revised timetable will be implemented on January 1, 1937. According to the new timetable, there will be a Capital Express train at 8:00 AM and a Shanghai-Nanjing Express train at 8:35 AM departing from the North Station, and a Nanjing-Shanghai Express train at 7:10 PM and a Capital Express train at 8:31 PM departing from Wuxi Station. This is already very convenient for tourists visiting Suzhou and Wuxi, so the Sunday special passenger trains will be suspended starting January 1, 1937.</p>

<p>The Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association, in order to help the rural economy, contacted the Shanghai Zhonghui and Liang Banks in the early summer of this year to organize an agricultural loan program. The association independently handled all business matters, which was greatly appreciated by the general farmers. At that time, 50 production mutual aid societies, totaling 383 people, requested loans, and a total of 5,455 yuan was issued. The loans have now matured and were fully recovered the day before yesterday, and the funds were remitted to the Shanghai Zhonghui and Liang Banks as scheduled. Not only have farmers benefited greatly, but the association's business spirit and creditworthiness are also commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Joyful Gathering for Destitute Children Held Yesterday with Great Success <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Joyful Gathering for Destitute Children, organized by the Shanghai YMCA, was held yesterday morning in major theaters in various districts after a long period of preparation. This year, because it is necessary to establish a Joyful Gathering Place for Destitute Children to provide long-term services, only a bag of sugar candy and biscuits was given to each child. However, the programs at each venue were more exciting than in the previous two years, with the Xihai Theater being the most outstanding. The number of people in each district was based on the size of each theater, with the larger ones having more than a thousand people and the smaller ones having seven or eight hundred people, all of whom were extremely crowded and there was no space to sit. Moreover, there were still more than a hundred people lingering outside each venue, and some even held old admission tickets from last year's Joyful Gathering for Destitute Children, requesting to participate. This shows that the Joyful Gathering for Destitute Children is needed by the general destitute children, and after the establishment of the Joyful Gathering Place for Destitute Children, the number of participants will surely increase even more. The comparison of the Joyful Gathering for Destitute Children over the past three years shows that this year is the best. The order at each venue was neat and organized, and there was no noise or disturbance. The achievements of the three years can be seen from this.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Yesterday Was Christmas, Prayers Were Held at Catholic Churches, and Donations for Aircraft Were Collected <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Last month, on Generalissimo Chiang's 50th birthday, the Catholic Church in China, represented by Bishop Yu Bin of Nanjing and Mr. Lu Bohong, President of the Catholic Action Association, presented two ambulance aircraft on behalf of 3 million Catholics. At that time, due to the urgency of the matter, Mr. Yu and Mr. Lu advanced 50,000 yuan to cover the cost and then notified Catholics throughout the country to donate. Yesterday was the feast of Christmas, and the Catholic churches in the city took the opportunity to mobilize and collect donations for the aircraft. Male and female students or members of the Catholic Action Association served as solicitors at the venues. At the same time, sincere prayers were offered in the church for Generalissimo Chiang's safe escape, the consolidation of the government, and the stability of the situation. Catholics, due to the suppression of bandits in Suiyuan, the donation of aircraft, and the government leader's ordeal, practiced frugality in addition to religious celebrations, and abolished extravagant acts such as banquets and gift-giving to show their determination to overcome national difficulties together. It is reported that more than 10,000 yuan was donated yesterday in various Catholic churches throughout the city.</p>

Cai Jinjun, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and photographers Chen Chuanlin and Lu Shifu visited the exhibition the day before yesterday and praised the three artists for promoting patriotism through art. In recent days, several of Ao's works, such as "Misty Rain," "Clouds Deep Unknown," and "Lovers Under Flowers," have been purchased. It is reported that the three artists will donate half of the proceeds from the sale of the works at the exhibition to the soldiers suppressing bandits in Suiyuan. The exhibition is scheduled to end at the end of the month, with only a few days remaining.</p>

<p>The 22nd day of this month in the Gregorian calendar is Mr. Wang Yiting's 70th birthday, and all sectors are celebrating. All members of the Tijin Calligraphy and Painting Society on Jiaotong Road, in view of Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for social welfare and his status as a pioneer in calligraphy and painting, each presented him with a large screen of their own masterpieces, including figures by Shen Xinhai, He Quanjian, Li Fangyuan, and Gao Shangzhi; animals by Liu Yuxing, Xiong Songquan, Hong Lisheng, and Ye Weixin; landscapes by Sun Xueni, Wang Zhongshan, Yao Mocun, Ying Yeping, and Ding Liuyang; flowers by Shen Yizhai, Cai Yimin, and Chen Rongji; flowers and birds and antiques by Ms. Wu Qingxia; and figures and court ladies by Jiang Dongbai.

Also, at the society's regular meeting the week before, in addition to each person's new works, they jointly created a "Song of Longevity" painting after drinking, concentrating their minds and using ingenious methods, which is truly a rare treasure. It is currently displayed in the society for public viewing.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government, considering that the weather is currently very cold and it is the peak period for intensifying winter defense, and fearing that petty thieves may take the opportunity to commit crimes, has ordered the winter defense offices in each district to strictly prevent crimes in order to maintain public order. Accordingly, the police have been dispatched to routinely inspect inns, teahouses, and taverns within their respective jurisdictions. Travelers with suspicious appearances are subject to thorough questioning at train and ship stations. Police officers in various townships patrol day and night, and security teams are stationed in key areas along the coast.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Russian Gang of Thieves Committed Many Crimes; Investigation is Difficult <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives of the General Patrol Room previously learned that there was a large gang of Russian thieves who had committed numerous crimes in Tianjin and fled to Shanghai, where they continued their activities, plotting wrongdoing. They were arrested at No. 227 Nanyang Road, No. 664 Route Lafayette, No. 5, Lane 14 of the same road, and No. 440 Bazhi Road. The Russians arrested were Shilafuv, Nashifuv, Liwenfa, Koshimai, Maimikang, Dimituo, Paikefu and seven others. Five pistols, 185 bullets, one car, two counterfeit car license plates, two instruments to melt silver bars and blow up walls, one bamboo ladder and a lot of iron ware were found. They were escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The case was originally scheduled to be heard by Judge Feng Shide in the First Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. However, because the organization of each criminal is extremely complicated, and the crime is also spread all over the area, the investigation is quite difficult. Therefore, the investigation had not been completed as of yesterday, and it was difficult to proceed with the trial. Therefore, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi applied to the First Special Court for a postponement for further interrogation, which was approved by Judge Feng, who ordered the postponement to next Tuesday (the 29th) at 2:00 PM.</p>

<p>The body of Ms. Shi Jinghua, wife of Dr. Yin Zhiling, a well-known figure in the business community, who died of difficult labor yesterday, will be placed in a coffin at the Gordon Road Central Funeral Home at 1:00 PM today, and the funeral procession will depart at 2:00 PM. The Shanghai Municipal Council will dispatch a mounted police and a military band to lead the procession. Ms. Shi, 38, was one of the leaders of the women's movement in the May Fourth Movement of this year, and was the chairman of the student union of the Wuben Girls' School. Since marrying Dr. Yin in 1924, she has worked hard in household management and national salvation. But Heaven did not grant her long life, and she died of difficult labor, leaving behind five children. Dr. Yin has extensive social connections, and the funeral procession with white cars and horses is expected to be a grand sight.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Starting Next Year, Coal and Stone Lighterage Fees Will Increase; Notice Has Been Sent to the Coal Industry Association for Review <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The coal and stone lighterage industry in Shanghai has decided to increase the lighterage fees for short-distance transportation starting next year. The industry association has issued a notice stating: "The various shipping companies have reported that in recent years, prices of all goods have been rising, resulting in supply not meeting demand. The various expenses of our shipping industry have also continued to increase, making it difficult to maintain operations. Not only is our shipping industry like this, but other industries are also increasing prices one after another to compensate. Therefore, our shipping industry has no choice but to increase the lighterage fees for short-distance transportation in this port by a certain amount in order to maintain our capital." The notice was submitted to the temporary executive committee meeting on December 6, which resolved that the reports of the shipping companies were indeed factual and that the lighterage fees for short-distance transportation in this port should be increased by five cents per ton from the original price, effective from January 1, 1937. The association has already asked the Shanghai Coal Industry Association to forward the notice to all coal merchants for review.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Shen Laisheng Sues for Encroachment After Brother's Widow Remarries <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Shen Laisheng, a resident of Yinhang Township in the city center, whose family was originally quite wealthy, suffered during the January 28th Incident when the area was in the war zone. His houses were destroyed in the bombing, and his parents were killed. Only Shen Laisheng and his younger brother Rong Sheng escaped with great difficulty. According to Shen Laisheng, his younger brother only managed to take out four pieces of paper with the title deed to over ten mu of ancestral farmland, along with the grain strings, and sent them to the home of his younger brother's uncle-in-law, Xu Mao Mao. However, his younger brother died soon after, and his brother's widow, Shen Xu, remarried Yu Xiaojiu and openly took her daughter, Tao Mei, as a drag-along child. She also took all the land deeds and conspired with the local security guard, Zhou Jutang, to sell or pawn them all. Based on this, he filed a complaint with the local court against Zhou Jutang and Shen Xu and others for encroachment and sale. The complaint also stated that his younger brother had passed away and had no heirs, so his son inherited the property. At that time, due to the destruction of the home in the war, no division of property was made. Later, his brother's widow said that she was a young widow and should have a means of livelihood, so she asked for a division of property before remarrying. Now that she has broken her promise and committed adultery with someone and remarried, it constitutes encroachment and should be dealt with according to the law. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Wu. The defendant's lawyer Yan Song argued that all the property had already been divided with the help of the aunt, Lu Mao Mao, in July last year, and the title deeds were each held, and the dispute had been resolved. It was clearly a malicious accusation. The official considered the contents to be complex and postponed the hearing to summon witnesses for further interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Hsiao Ming Girls' Middle School Thrift for Suiyuan Relief <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Since hearing the good news last month that the National Army was fighting bandits and puppets in Suiyuan, all teachers and students of Hsiao Ming Girls' Middle School of the Catholic Church in this city have been greatly encouraged and immediately launched a thrifty movement to aid Suiyuan, saving money on snacks, cosmetics, pocket money, and transportation expenses to help the soldiers on the front line. Later, it was learned that the Guisui Public Hospital, run by the Catholic Church in the front, had taken in many wounded soldiers and was in urgent need of funds. The first phase of the thrift expenses was settled, totaling $115.10, which was entrusted to Father Cao Aitang Lei to be directly remitted to Guisui. Now, a letter of thanks has been received from Father Fei Huaiyong, the president of the Public Hospital, informing that there are still more than 60 seriously wounded people in the hospital waiting for treatment, including warriors wounded in the battles of Zugertu and Bailingmiao, many of whom have broken legs and arms. Some have their dental arches dislodged, becoming disabled, which is unbearable to witness. The donations received will be completely distributed to the wounded soldiers for treatment and comfort. Soldiers bravely defend the territory, and once they are injured and disabled, they are ignored, which is inhumane. Donating money to help wounded soldiers is not only a good deed but also a patriotic expression. After receiving the letter, all teachers and students of the school were deeply moved and transferred the money for Christmas and New Year's greeting cards and candies, totaling $119.71, directly to Guisui Public Hospital to provide relief to disabled veterans.</p>
<h3 id="e123">One-Day Movement Promotion Association's Fourth Collection of Donations <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>

<h3 id="e124">Lu Lihua's Report on Investigating National Products: Local Movements are Developing Rapidly, Contributing Opinions in Four Steps <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Lu Lihua was commissioned by the National Products Joint Association to investigate the status of the National Products Movement in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. She has now completed the task and returned to Shanghai. She specially reported the investigation process to the association. The following is an excerpt from Ms. Lu's report: Lihua departed from Shanghai on the 15th of last month to inspect Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan provinces, investigating the status of the National Products Movement in various places and promoting the National Products Movement. First, she passed through Wuhu, which is the commercial center of Anhui Province. They strongly promote the National Products Movement. There is a National Products Ten-Day Newspaper, a National Products Road, and a small-scale National Products Company to sell domestic products. However, the National Products Movement Association is still lacking. After arriving in the port, I discussed with Administrative Commissioner Gao Wenbo, and the Commissioner's Office hosted a meeting of representatives from all walks of life to prepare for the organization. Fifteen groups attended, and I contributed my humble opinions on the spot, which were deeply appreciated. As a result, it was decided to publicly recommend nine preparatory committee members to form a preparatory committee first, and then establish the National Products Movement Promotion Association. Anqing is the capital of Anhui Province, and its commerce is inferior to Wuhu. Although there is no organization of the National Products Association in the area, they also pay close attention to the National Products Movement. After my arrival, I consulted with the authorities, and the Provincial Party Headquarters hosted a meeting of various institutions, groups, schools, etc., to organize the Anhui Provincial National Products Promotion Preparatory Committee. Jiujiang is an important commercial port in Jiangxi, and a National Products Movement Promotion Association has been established, which was organized by Lin Bingzhou, the brigade commander of the First Independent Brigade of the Navy Marine Corps stationed there, in conjunction with all sectors of society. Military-civilian cooperation is commendable. Wuhan is an important town in Central China, and its commerce has always been developed. The Hankou National Products Movement is led by Mayor Wu Guozhen. There is now a National Products Company and a National Products Movement Committee, which is organized by 15 institutions and groups, including the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The chairman is Yi Baoxun. There is no National Products Movement organization in the Wuchang area. This decision was made by Cheng Jubao of the Department of Education after the inspection, and gathered various institutions and groups to prepare for the organization, and agreed to contact the Hankou National Products Movement Committee to organize the "Hubei Provincial National Products Movement Joint Association" for preparation. The venue is temporarily set up in the Provincial Science Experiment Museum, and it should be established soon. The Hunan People's Patriotic National Products Promotion Association in Changsha is organized by various departments, groups, and organizations of the Hunan Provincial Party, Government, Military, and Police. There is also a large-scale exhibition hall that also sells domestic products. The construction cost is more than 700,000 yuan, and the collection of domestic products is very good. The business is also very developed, and it can be called a force in the Hunan National Products Circle. At the same time, the Shanghai China National Products Company has already set up a branch in the area, and the scale is fairly complete. Looking at the National Products Movement in various places, it can be said that it is quite developed, and the organizers are also working hard. However, what is regrettable is that (1) the authorities have not been able to provide full support, (2) there is a lack of funds, and the established plans are not easy to implement, (3) some of the work is not practical, and (4) the National Products organizations in various places are different, the names are confused, and they cannot be linked consistently to carry out large-scale movement work. Lihua's perception is that there should be four steps to promote national products: (1) Investigate the local production and consumption of national products, (2) Promote the improvement of national products, (3) Enable people to develop the ability to identify national products and non-national products, (4) Universally practice national products. At the same time, the name and organization should be unified, and the highest organ should be set up nationwide to oversee its completion. Provincial, municipal, county, and township areas should set up branch associations. This system is clear, the organization is unified, and the power is consistent, which can achieve the effect of fingers and arms. Annual activity plans should be formulated and implemented step by step, from the center to the township area, nationwide unity, and work results will be even more impressive.</p>

<p>Comrade Xue Hongchang, a member of the 35th Branch of the Second District of this city, paid for the production of 1,000 silk cotton vests and raised 2,000 more from relatives and friends, which were sent to the Municipal Party Headquarters to be forwarded to the Central Government. Now it is learned that the Central Government has specially replied with a letter of commendation, the original text of which is as follows: "The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality has forwarded to the meeting that the comrade raised funds to manufacture 3,000 silk cotton vests to be used by the soldiers resisting the enemy in Suiyuan. After approval by the Standing Committee, it was found that Comrade Xue generously contributed and his patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. In addition to forwarding the cotton vests to the front, this letter is sent to Comrade Xue Hongchang for review. Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, December 21."</p>

<p>The Suisui Minsheng Canal is one of the achievements of the work-for-relief project of the China Foreign Famine Relief General Association at 505 Henan Road in this port. It was excavated in the autumn of 1928 and lasted four years, with a total construction cost of 750,000 yuan, before it was handed over to the Suiyuan Provincial Water Conservancy Association for management to complete the western project. Later, due to financial constraints, it was virtually suspended, resulting in silting over time, making irrigation difficult. In September of this year, the Famine Relief Association re-discussed dredging and ordered engineer Zhang Jichun to take 15,000 yuan to Tuheqi, Sarachi County, to set up an office, and together with the local authorities, recruited for the reorganization. Since the start of construction, the project has progressed very smoothly. Within a month, most of it was completed. On October 19, water was introduced into the canal, with an average depth of six feet, and the flow was very smooth. From then on, nearby fields can be irrigated, and farmers are all happy.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai-Taiwan Qian Dahua ship of the Ping An Shipping Company ran aground at Liuzhushan Mouth, Shuangqikou, Dinghai, the passengers were completely rescued by the Nanhai ship of the Ningbo Nanhai Shipping Company and safely arrived in Dinghai Ningbo. As for the cargo of oranges and the like, a total of 2,000 pieces, it has been unloaded and transported to Dinghai.

<p>To the Editor, I recently read your newspaper's 21st [of December] report that the Shandong bandit Mao Jiwen was arrested in Shanghai based on a letter from the victim. After reading it, I was shocked and dismayed. I have been in Shanghai for many years, and I have been working as a teacher. My conduct has always been proper, but due to my straightforward nature and interactions with people, I fear that I may have been envied by petty people. The reason for being summoned by the police was actually due to a secret letter fabricated by malicious people. However, after examination, it has been proven that the scar on my leg is definitely not a gunshot wound, but was indeed caused by an unknown malignant sore in my childhood. Furthermore, with the guarantees of all parties, I am indeed a law-abiding civilian, and I was released immediately. The report in your newspaper has greatly affected my reputation. I hope that your newspaper will make corrections immediately. Respectfully, Mao Xiaowen of Shen Bao Guan Taiwan</p>

<p>— Edited by China Credit Information</p>
<p>(No. 40 of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview)</p>
<p>12. Kailang Dry Battery Factory—This factory is operated as a partnership by the three brothers Jiang Younan, Jiang Shaonan, and Jiang Bohou, with a small amount of outside investment. It was established in the 18th year of the Republic of China [1929]. Initially, it only manufactured batteries. Later, when the Yongfeng Hand-Held Lantern Shell Factory, which was run by their father Jiang Yinan, closed down the year before last, the factory also began to manufacture hand-held lantern shells. The total capital is 45,000 yuan. The factory base is located at No. 51, Sanyang Lane, West Baoxing Road, Zhabei, with more than a dozen rented rooms, divided into battery and lantern shell departments, employing more than 80 workers in total. The batteries produced by the factory are branded with the "Rongguang" trademark and can produce 1,000 dozen per day. The lantern shells can produce 50 to 100 dozen.</p>
<p>In addition to the above 12 companies, there are still many manufacturers of electrical materials such as light bulbs, batteries, and electric fans in this city. However, due to their average scale, they have little impact on the future of the industry, so they are not listed one by one.</p>
<p>3. Production and Sales of Electrical Materials</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The sales of electrical materials produced by various factories are closely related to the season. For example, electric fans and irons are popular in the summer months, while electric stoves and hot pots are popular in the cold winter. Other items such as various flashlights also have better sales after the harvest, because people in the interior often have the purchasing power to purchase these items at that time. Currently, some manufacturers are working day and night to manufacture flashlights, precisely for this reason. In recent years, the sales of various military electrical materials have been particularly good, which is causally related to the rapid development of military transportation in recent years. As for the destinations of transportation, they vary depending on the type of electrical appliance. Generally speaking, flashlights are mainly sold in towns and cities north of the Yangtze River and along the Yangtze River where the electric lighting industry is not yet developed, and there are also considerable sales in Southeast Asia. Most of the batteries are transported to cities such as Hankou, Changsha, Chongqing, Yichang, Nanchang, and Anqing, and then resold to townships. This city and the Beijing-Hankou area mostly use foreign batteries. As for electric fans, electric stoves, irons, light bulbs, etc., only a few large cities can consume them, because the existence of the electrical industry is the only condition for their use.

<p>The momentum of the December standard yarn at the Yarn and Cotton Exchange has turned calm. Due to sufficient delivery, it has been pressured into a peaceful state. According to the market, more than 3,000 bales have been delivered into the warehouse in the past day. Several hundred bales of 10s, 16s, and 20s Japanese yarn have also been delivered, indicating that the shorts are working hard to find solutions. On the one hand, it is due to the year-end relationship. Yarn sales are sluggish, and all parties have surpluses, indicating that the factory's foundations can gradually loosen. According to market news, another 3,700 bales were delivered today. The yarn brands and amounts are as follows (in bales):</p>

<p>Yesterday, when US cotton opened, domestic and foreign counterparts bought in bulk at limited prices, especially for the near months, fearing unfavorable developments in the European political situation. Therefore, the market price rose by 6 to 12 points in the early morning. Apart from long liquidations, there were not many sellers. Spot traders and large accounts bought January and March futures. The January delivery notice will be released on Monday, and this account has quite a bit to cover. There are fewer new off-industry accounts. The industry's needs are very smooth. At the close, the public actively bought in, and the market price was firm. Spot prices rose by 16 points, and futures rose by 15 to 20 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 7 points, and futures rose by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton exporters bought in bulk, exports increased, shorts covered, and hedged futures. The market conditions were firm. Bengal rose by 2 to 2.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 2.5 to 2.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 2.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (December 24th telegram):</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for December 25th is Broach at 228 rupees, Oomra at 208 rupees, and Bengal at 175 rupees, all up 1.5 rupees.</p>

<p>The woolen fabric market can be described as excellent recently. Because the end of the year is approaching, and due to environmental factors, most holders are unwilling to extend credit. Buyers have no choice but to pay in cash, and business remains prosperous. After continuous investigation, the stock in this city seems to be in short supply. The import of Western goods from Europe and America has ceased, and what has been reported are completely thin goods for spring sales. Eastern goods have also arrived in small quantities, only postal deliveries. Domestic products cannot keep up. Ten-number riding breeches, Croton, horse-colored sleeve linings, etc., are all vying for fixed dyeing. The goods ordered ten days ago cannot be delivered one by one, resulting in Melton flat thick wool, various suit overcoat wool, riding breeches Croton, Coktin, long-haired camel fleece, horse-colored satin, French feet, silk feather yarn, women's colored wool, Qini, etc., all having a shortage of one yard for every yard sold. In the future, as the weather turns cold, the thick woolen fabric market will inevitably become more prosperous, causing the holders to remain optimistic and continue to look upwards. Unlike in previous years, overcoat wool fell in price after the festival. The foreign firms are said to be actively engaged in annual ordering business. Because people in the industry appreciate the current good market conditions, the shortage of goods, and high prices, many are adopting it. The collection of accounts has returned to one level. This year, the expectation is that the closing will be better than in previous years. The market this year has a sense of recovery and prosperity. The autumn harvest has been bountiful, and the woolen fabric and Western clothing shops, both large and small, can all expect profits. Therefore, accounts are easier to collect than in previous years.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Special Feature: Production, Sales, and Manufacturing of Keemun Black Tea <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>In the year 25 of the Republic of China (1936), the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, in an effort to revive their tea industries, initiated a unified sales plan. They also telegraphed the Ministry of Industries, requesting the dispatch of personnel to conduct origin inspections to prevent the proliferation of inferior teas. Consequently, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau sent personnel to expedite the preparations. This was completed in July, and a detailed report on the quality of tea products in the Keemun tea region was submitted. Now, amidst the accumulated problems of the tea industry, there is an urgent need for reorganization. Therefore, a portion of the report concerning production, manufacturing, and sales is excerpted and introduced to the readers. Editor's note: Keemun Black Tea is a general term for black tea produced in Keemun, Fuliang, Zhide, and Guichi. It is commonly referred to as "Keemun, Fuliang, and Zhide," omitting Guichi because of its relatively small tea production. Keemun Black Tea benefits from uniquely favorable natural conditions. Its color, aroma, and taste are not only leaders among domestic black teas but also enjoy a worldwide reputation in the international tea market. With high prices and broad sales, Keemun's production, despite having only over sixty years of history, has deeply impressed people both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>The production, manufacturing, and sales of Keemun Black Tea represent three different classes. Production is handled by tea farmers; refinement is done by tea firms; and sales are introduced to foreign firms by tea brokers. This year, the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Unified Sales Office is taking over the role of tea brokers. As for foreign firms handling tea, they mostly act on behalf of overseas tea merchants, occupying the position of agents. Therefore, the ultimate responsibility for sales rests with overseas tea merchants. It should be noted that Keemun was not initially a producer of black tea. Sixty years ago, it was famous for producing green tea, which was transported and sold in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces and enjoyed a high reputation. Because its processing method was similar to that of Lu'an tea, it was also known as An tea. Until the second year of the Guangxu era (1876), a Mr. Yu from Yixian, who came from Zhide, established a workshop in Likou and encouraged tea farmers to manufacture black tea, purchasing it at high prices. This practice then spread to Shanli. Driven by profit, people switched to black tea production, leading to the world-renowned Keemun Black Tea of today. However, over the past sixty years, the production and sales of Keemun Black Tea have also gone from prosperity to decline, which should deeply alarm us.</p>
<p>(1) Production and Manufacturing of Keemun Black Tea</p>
<p>There have been no statistics on the exact area under tea cultivation in Keemun. Generally, tea plants are cultivated on fertile mountain slopes. Tea is also planted on plains. Tea farmers open up land on a small scale and it is scattered, making statistics impossible. According to estimates of tea production from the Department of Agricultural Economics of Jinling University, the total area of tea land in the Keemun region is over 81,500 mu.</p>
<p>Most tea farmers are self-cultivating. Unfortunately, there are no reliable statistics on the number of households. In addition to tea cultivation, tea farmers also grow other crops to supplement their income.</p>
<p>The production and manufacturing of Keemun Black Tea involve the tea farmers picking fresh leaves and producing rough tea. Tea farms are responsible for further processing and packaging into boxes. This division of labor completes the production and manufacturing of Keemun Black Tea.</p>
<p>In the past, the number of tea firms in the Keemun region was very small, with substantial capital. Some produced thousands of boxes of tea. Later, due to the high prices of tea, tea brokers competed to provide loans to secure tea boxes. As a result, the number of tea firms increased sharply, while the number of tea boxes produced decreased daily, and costs increased. This gradually led to crude manufacturing. From the number of tea firms and the number of tea boxes produced in Keemun over the years, we can understand the general situation.</p>
<p>Table of the Number of Tea Firms and the Number of Black Tea Boxes Produced in Keemun County Over the Years</p>
<p>The average number of tea boxes produced per tea firm in Keemun County was still 456 in 1928. By 1932, the number of tea firms had suddenly increased to 194, while the average number of tea boxes produced per firm had fallen to 205, a decrease of more than half compared to 1928. The reason for the sudden increase in the number of tea firms in that year was the exceptionally high price of tea in 1931, which led to speculative merchants setting up firms in large numbers to seek substantial profits. Subsequently, as tea prices declined year after year, the number of tea firms also tended to decrease. However, each firm still produced only about two hundred boxes of tea, so its manufacturing costs remained uneconomical.</p>
<p>The counties of Fuliang and Zhide have also exhibited the same trend. Tea production has decreased annually, while the number of tea firms has increased. In 1934, Fuliang had 63 tea firms producing 15,000 boxes of tea, averaging 238 boxes per firm. This year, the number of tea firms increased to 68, but tea production was only 17,876 boxes. Similarly, in Zhide, there were only 34 tea firms producing 10,000 boxes of tea in 1934. This year, the number of tea firms increased to 47, but produced only 11,045 boxes of tea. The number of tea firms and the output do not increase proportionally, resulting in an average decrease in the number of tea boxes produced by each firm. However, the expenses of all tea firms do not decrease proportionally with the number of tea boxes produced, resulting in higher costs for Keemun Black Tea.</p>
<p>Moreover, the widespread establishment of branch offices by tea firms to compete for rough tea is also one of the reasons for the increase in costs. In Keemun, in the southwest corner of the county, there is no need for 130 tea firms to engage in refinement; nor is there a need for each firm to widely establish branch offices to collect rough tea. This increases manufacturing costs and causes complications, while tea farmers gain no real benefits from rushing from one place to another. Sometimes, after repeated journeys, good quality rough tea undergoes excessive fermentation and deteriorates. Therefore, the large number of tea firms and the excessive establishment of branch offices hinder the development of Keemun Black Tea leaves.</p>
<p>Cooperative movements in the Keemun area began in Keemun in 1933, promoted and guided by the Keemun Tea Improvement Farm, pioneering tea farmers' cooperative tea production. At that time, with proper guidance, the results were significant. As a result, tea farmers followed suit and organized tea transportation, sales, and credit cooperatives to achieve the goals of self-production, self-manufacturing, and self-sales. The benefits of the cooperatives, in a passive sense, are sufficient to eliminate the exploitation of middlemen. In a positive sense, they are also sufficient to improve the living standards of tea farmers. The principles are pure, so they have been able to develop vigorously in three years. The number of cooperatives increased from only one in 1933 to 36 in 1936. The number of members also increased accordingly. The rapid development of cooperative movements in the past four years can be seen in the table below.</p>
<p>Table of the Number of Keemun Black Tea Production and Sales Cooperatives in the Past Four Years</p>
<p>The development of cooperative movements is indeed a positive phenomenon. However, to weigh the success of cooperative movements, quality is more important than quantity. If cooperatives can be well-organized and effective, tea farmers will join without being encouraged. Therefore, promoters of cooperative movements should not seek an increase in quantity but should prioritize quality. The future of cooperative movements is promising.</p>
<p>(2) The Trade of Keemun Black Tea</p>
<p>After Keemun Black Tea is refined and packaged into boxes, it is traditionally transported by water to Jiujiang and then transferred to Shanghai, where it is sold to foreign firms through tea brokers. This year, the authorities of Anhui and Jiangxi provinces implemented unified sales, changing to land transport to Shanghai. It is sold to various foreign firms by the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Unified Sales Office without going through tea brokers. This is truly an unprecedented reform in the domestic trade of Keemun Black Tea in the past eighty years. Although the connection between tea brokers and inland tea firms has been interrupted, the power of foreign firms is still difficult to contain.</p>
<p>The largest purchaser of Keemun Black Tea is Jardine Matheson, a British trading company, accounting for two-fifths of Keemun's production. Other companies such as Gim Loong, Xiehe, Tianyu, Baochang, and Xingcheng also purchase significant amounts, followed by Huacha, Tongfu, and Tianxiang. According to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's inspection statistics for the past four years, Jardine Matheson has exported the most Keemun tea each year, at 7,000 to 8,000 metric tons per year. Other foreign firms export a few dozen metric tons at the low end, and only 3,000 to 4,000 metric tons at the high end. A comprehensive review of the table below will reveal the Keemun tea trade situation of various trading companies.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Summary of Methods for Improving Agricultural Crops <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Fu</p>
<p>The goal of improving agricultural crops is nothing more than increasing yield and improving quality, and its ultimate goal is to increase revenue. We advocate that research on yield and quality should not only use statistical methods to compare the results, but also recognize that yield and quality are composed of many factors. We should work on factor analysis, and try to describe the main items as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Cellular aspects, such as the number of chromosomes and their genome situation.</p>
<p>2.  Morphological aspects, such as the depth and distribution of roots, the amount of tillering or branching, and the condition of fruiting.</p>
<p>3.  Physiological aspects, such as the earliness or lateness of maturity, and the strength or weakness of fertilizer tolerance.</p>
<p>4.  Ecological aspects</p>
<p>A. The impact on the environment, such as drought resistance and cold resistance.</p>
<p>B. The relationship with diseases and insects. According to the type of crop, select the main diseases and insect pests, and investigate the resistance capacity.</p>
<p>The above items are all related to yield and quality, and they are also interconnected, making it difficult to make accurate judgments. Therefore, they are analyzed into two categories: normal and abnormal. Taking yield as an example, under normal conditions, it can be estimated from cellular, morphological, and physiological aspects. Under abnormal conditions, it can be estimated from ecological relationships, so there are slight clues to follow. Furthermore, the characteristics of each variety are partly hereditary and partly adapted to the environment. Hereditary traits do not undergo mutations under normal conditions, making them more reliable and easier to study. Environmental adaptations change at any time and place, making them extremely complex and requiring cultivation in various environments before they can be understood, making research more difficult. Studying them separately will provide more clues.</p>
<p>However, hereditary traits are also based on the principle of survival of the fittest. The varieties preserved today must have traits suitable for the production environment. Because the climate, topography, water conservancy, and soil quality vary from place to place, the types and varieties of crops suitable for them also vary. If we want to improve agricultural crops, we should first investigate the conditions in various places, divide them into regions, and generally specify which types of varieties are suitable for a certain region and which cultivation methods should be applied. When breeding, these types of varieties should be used as basic varieties to begin with. Taking Jiangsu rice as an example, the area north of the Yangtze River is an early indica rice area, the Jingzhen area is a mid-indica rice area, the Su-Chang area is a late japonica rice area, the area near Yutan is a glutinous rice area, and Pudong is an early japonica rice area. Once the regions are divided, the varieties suitable for each region are also limited.</p>
<p>Once the area for a certain type of crop has been defined, investigate the original varieties in the area and select the one that is planted most widely in the area and has the highest yield over the years to serve as the basic variety. Perform selection or crossbreeding within this basic variety. Strive to save labor in breeding, shorten the number of years, and ensure that the results are reliable.</p>
<p>We advocate that when carrying out breeding, it is very important to first delineate regions and limit varieties. As for the breeding work itself, it is considered less important. In terms of pure line breeding, limiting the selection of panicles or plants in the first year will prevent the number of selected lines from being too large. In areas with large regions and many varieties, select two to three thousand, such as late japonica rice in Jiangnan. In areas with small regions and few varieties, selecting only a few hundred is sufficient. However, the selection area should not be biased towards one corner but should be spread throughout the region. In the first year, there should also be single-panicle rows or single-plant rows, but the selection criteria should not be based on visual observation and comparison with control rows to determine whether to take or discard. Each row should be sown with one grain or planted with a single plant to facilitate the investigation of its various characteristics. Before carrying out breeding, it is necessary to determine the goal. In addition to increasing yield per mu, attention should also be paid to one or several of the following aspects based on local conditions: earliness, drought resistance, disease resistance, and insect resistance. Then the selection goal can also be defined. In the second and third years, the number of repetitions and the amount of seeds are gradually increased. The row system is still used, and the selection goal, in addition to paying attention to the investigation of various growth traits, also measures yield. After the fourth year, a small-scale system can be adopted, with the size of each area tentatively set at one-twentieth of a mu, repeated three times, and continued for three years. The block arrangement method is used to eliminate differences in soil and years using variance analysis, accurately identifying the high or low yield of the lines. The characteristics that require a large amount of data can also be checked after the fourth year. Select the excellent ones and carry out propagation.</p>
<p>Starting from the seventh year, in addition to distributing them to agricultural farms in various counties in the region to conduct regional trials, they should also be planted in various different environments to observe their adaptability. For example, rice should be applied with a large amount of fertilizer or a small amount of fertilizer to test its fertilizer tolerance and determine whether it is suitable for fertile or barren land, and whether it requires a large amount of fertilizer or only a small amount of fertilizer. Various depths of water should also be irrigated to test its suitability for dry land or wet land, terraced fields, flat fields, or polder fields. After clearly investigating the impact of the environment on each line, it can be decided which type of land is suitable for the species and which cultivation method should be used.</p>
<p>At this time, various cultivation methods can be applied according to the characteristics of each line to regulate it. For example, if the tillering of rice is small, the planting density should be increased to increase the number of individuals, thereby compensating for the reduction in the number of tillers per individual, so that the yield per unit area is not reduced. Ensure that the cultivation methods used are exactly what the line needs to maximize production.</p>
<p>Regarding crossbreeding methods, the Japanese system can be followed, dividing the country into several regions based on climate, topography, water conservancy, and soil quality. Each region should have a national agricultural experiment branch to carry out large-scale crossbreeding work until F3. Then, these seeds should be distributed to the provincial agricultural experiment stations in the region to continue cultivation, conduct rigorous investigations, and gradually eliminate them until F7. Then, they should be distributed to the county-level agricultural experiment stations in the province to cultivate them until the crossbred species is fixed.</p>
<p>Therefore, we also have special insights into the organization of agricultural crop improvement agencies and their business. It is believed that the main task of the central agricultural crop improvement agency is to conduct research on various methods, such as testing the flour milling rate of wheat, which equipment to use, and investigating the drought resistance of rice, which methods to use. After obtaining considerable results through precise research, publish them to the public so that the experiment stations in various places can use them. As for the agricultural crop improvement agencies in each province, they should be divided into several regions according to the climate, topography, water conservancy, soil quality, and people's habits in the province. Each region should establish an agricultural crop experiment station to preside over breeding, cultivation method experiments, etc. Taking Jiangsu as an example, Xuhai is a miscellaneous grain area, the coastal area is a cotton area, Jiangnan is a late japonica rice area, and Huainan is an early indica rice area. A provincial experiment station should be established in each area to handle it. If the central agency focuses on breeding work, although the equipment is complete and the talents are gathered, the improved varieties bred may only be suitable for the local climate and soil conditions, and cannot be popularized throughout the country. The talents and equipment cannot be used to their full potential and achieve the greatest effect. It is also inappropriate for each province not to divide regions by crop type. For example, if the Jiangsu wheat experiment station is located in Tongshan, it cannot take care of the wheat crop improvement in Jiangnan. If the rice crop experiment station is located in Songjiang, it does not focus on wheat crops, so that Wujin, Wuxi, and Yixing, the main wheat-producing areas, have no provincial agency to take responsibility for improvement. The provincial agricultural crop experiment stations in each region of a province and the county-level agricultural experiment stations should be interconnected and cooperate thoroughly, like the arm uses the finger, and the finger uses the arm. In this way, adapt to the local conditions, divide the work, and cooperate to study the excellent varieties and cultivation methods suitable for each place. In this way, the improvement of agricultural crops can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Zhenji sent me a private discussion on improving agricultural crop methods written by him. It has been accumulated for more than 20 years of experience. The content of this work is known to be precise and detailed. I always think that to solve the current problem of people's food, the negative way is to adjust, and the positive way is to increase production. Nowadays, many wise people are more inclined to adjustment. It is understood that the effect of increasing production is slower and the matter is more complicated. However, increasing production must start with improving crops, and those who can regard this as a lifelong career and are tireless are rare, as far as I know, like Mr. Gu. Therefore, I chose a section from the full text, "Summary of Methods for Improving Agricultural Crops" for publication, to see a glimpse, so that you can know the path of agricultural crop improvement.

<h3 id="e159">Please Let Sisters Across the Country Accomplish This Wonderful Deed <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Juanhua</p>
<p>Dear Sisters,</p>
<p>For the past few years, we have always believed that only by implementing armed resistance can we save our country from danger.</p>
<p>Now, the battle drums of Eastern Sui have sounded. The enemy, insatiable in their greed, has launched a large-scale offensive against Suiyuan. Our soldiers, defending our land, are resolutely resisting regardless of the cost, which is something all the people of our country should wholeheartedly support. Good news is coming one after another. The Bailing Temple and the Great Temple have been successively recovered by our army. If this continues, the lost territories of the past, as long as the whole country is united, will not be difficult to recover in due course within a reasonable period of time, wiping out the extraordinary shame and humiliation of the past. However, this task is by no means something that a few people can accomplish. It must be realized by all our compatriots, contributing strength and money, under the common goal of resisting the enemy.</p>
<p>Recently, the amount of donations from various places to support Suiyuan is also quite a lot, but to demand long-term resistance, a large amount of supply is necessary. I now have a small suggestion to be adopted by sisters all over the country. The method is very simple: save your daily cosmetics money to help the soldiers defending the land in the front, because it doesn't matter if we don't use cosmetics for a day.</p>
<p>Friends, don't take it as a joke. At first glance, it seems like a drop in the bucket and won't help, but as long as you gather the strength of the majority, you may be able to build a tower from sand and make a small contribution to the country. Assuming that there are 40 million sisters in the country who use cosmetics (this is the minimum number), if they save it in one day, at least each person can save five cents (sisters in the city must save more than this amount), then a total of two million yuan can be saved. This is a considerable sum of money. If this money is remitted to the front, how meaningful and practical it will be, and how glorious it will be for our women's community! This is an easy task and there is no difficulty in doing it. I hope that female compatriots all over the country will practice it. In particular, I would like to ask the sisters in schools to take the lead in promoting and completing this meaningful good deed. (Editor's note: It is best to ask a bank in Shanghai to collect this donation specifically. Once a considerable amount is collected, it will be remitted to the front to see how much results can be achieved.)</p>
<h3 id="e160">A Brief Review of "Extraordinary Woman Assassins Yin" <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Xiaoru</p>
<p>Together with the Shi Jianqiao assassination of Sun case, it is a heroic act. It can give female compatriots a lift! Dying for one's country, she can be called a female hero! Yin, the Deputy Official who died with her, cannot be "mentioned in the same breath".</p>
<p>The country has been brought to such a critical point, if there are still heartless people who are willing to betray and act as accomplices to tigers, how shameful and punishable is that? There is an ancient saying that goes, "Rebellious officials and traitors, everyone has the right to punish them!"</p>
<p>Whenever there is a great turbulent era, many extraordinary people and events are produced. Recently, there has been a news story in the newspaper entitled "Record of Extraordinary Woman Assassin Yin". The traitor Yin willingly acted as a traitor, and has long been reviled by the people of the country! Now there is actually such an extraordinary woman who went to plot an assassination, and the result was that she sacrificed a precious life in vain. No one who has read it does not applaud and sigh! What's more, risking an assassination is not as harmless and convenient as acting in a play?</p>
<p>We only need to see her meticulous design, and for the sake of the great righteousness of the country and the nation, she can disregard everything and sacrifice herself. It can be said that she is both wise and brave! And after the failure, she was subjected to brutal torture by × Fang to force a confession, but she was still calm and fearless, and cursed at Yin until death without saying who was instigating her, which is even more awe-inspiring and admirable!</p>
<p>Although her result was unfortunately a failure, she died for her country. But her spirit is eternal; her death can be said to be great, glorious, and even more sufficient to show the evil of Yin's betrayal.</p>
<p>There was also a man named Yin who died with her - Yin's deputy official. Although he also died for conspiring to assassinate without success, his initial motivation was because he could gain both money and beauty. Moreover, he was originally an traitor. The cause of the failure was rooted in his inability to keep secrets. He did not not know that his mother was the traitor's wet nurse, although it was safe to move her away, why did he have to tell her the secret plot of the assassination? If this is said to be filial piety, it is too foolish! As a result, the good thing was destroyed and it can be said to be "a child cannot be entrusted with great things". In addition, the old woman did not understand the great righteousness, but only knew to value her personal kindness, and secretly told Yin in advance, hoping to take the opportunity to claim credit and still protect her son. Who thought it was still in vain! This is simply even more foolish! Therefore, her extinction is the result of "asking for it". Her son's death is also not to be regretted and absolutely cannot be compared with that extraordinary woman. (This is the truth, and the author's words are not biased.)</p>
<p>It is said that the extraordinary woman used to be a dancer and was also someone's concubine. But her past status cannot cause her present reputation to suffer any loss. It is precisely because of this that it is even more commendable! Because the lives of ordinary dancers and concubines are mostly romantic and spoiled. It is difficult to say that such a touching, earth-shattering event can be done by non-dancers and concubines. Even among educated intellectuals, there are few people with this kind of courage! This is why it is so extraordinary. If we compare Yin with those men who are still drunk, dreaming, and indulge in singing and dancing, we should truly be ashamed!</p>
<p>Nowadays, ordinary playwrights in Shanghai often put some startling "social news" on the stage. I think it's okay to adapt the story of this extraordinary woman into a script. If it is performed, the content will be full of twists and turns, and it will definitely move the audience! Originally, using the art of drama to promote the "save the country" movement is a "very meaningful" and "effective" method. After watching this story, people can be awakened and strive to know that the "popular will of China is not dead", and the vitality is still "vigorous"! At the same time, it can be understood that Chinese women are not completely "weak and incompetent" people!</p>
<h3 id="e161">Northeastern Women Surviving Winter <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Wen</p>
<p>The weather outside the Great Wall in winter is so cold, it's deadly cold. All day long, harsh, face-stinging north winds blow, and the ground is often covered with deep snow. There are far fewer people walking on the streets, and everywhere is filled with a desolate atmosphere.</p>
<p>The women of the Northeast, especially those in rural areas, have long been known for their ability to endure hardship and work hard. They work in the fields just like men. But in winter, because of the cold weather, they certainly can't work outdoors anymore. However, this doesn't mean they're idle; in fact, they're busy working all day long.</p>
<p>The first thing is sewing clothes and quilts. Because ordinary families all need to prepare new cotton clothes or take apart and wash old quilts in the late autumn and early winter for winter protection against the cold. Although this is not too heavy a task, putting a family's clothing together means they have to be busy for a considerable length of time. Therefore, every winter, because the days are short, they always light the lamps every night to do needlework, and only go to bed late at night.</p>
<p>However, what about the morning? They still get up especially early. The cold weather often causes their hands to freeze and crack, even to the point of bleeding. After eating breakfast, they are still busy with needlework.</p>
<p>Because it's cold, they have to put a brazier or stove in the room to keep it relatively warm, so in addition to other proper work, they also have to be careful about this kind of thing.</p>
<p>In addition, because the weather is unpredictable, you can't say when it will snow, so whenever they see the weather turning cloudy, they have to quickly tidy up the firewood pile and prepare firewood for several days. The north wind scraping their faces is as uncomfortable as a knife cutting, which is really painful. However, they have to do it, because if it snows, wet firewood cannot be burned immediately.</p>
<p>In addition, in some places, women are required to carry water, so they have to endure the cold and climb the slippery well platform covered with thick ice. That's an even more difficult job.</p>
<h3 id="e162">The Transformation of Russian Women in the Past Twenty-Five Years <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>Mrs. Hooterow, a reporter for the American New Era magazine, traveled to Russia in 1912. Recently, she returned for a three-week stay. After returning to the United States, she wrote an article, "Russian Women in the Past Twenty-Five Years," which compares women in the old Russian era with women in the new Russian era, which is extremely interesting. She said that when she traveled to Russia before the Great War, she stayed for two months. The Russian women she came into contact with could be classified into levels. The first level was aristocratic women. They did not have the melancholy mood that Russians possess. They spent all day long laughing and giggling, holding concerts, dancing, watching plays, and paying attention to clothing and decoration. This was their daily work. The second class was housewives in ordinary families. Although they did not have the economic strength of aristocratic women, they also had to try their best to live their extravagant and enjoyable vain lives. Although they were often scolded, and even beaten, by their husbands because of this, few were willing to change their outwardly strong but inwardly weak lives. The last type was the poor women, who accounted for more than 70%. Relying on simple family industrial income, or serving as slaves in aristocratic families, or even relying on secret prostitution or begging, they helped their husbands support the family or maintain their own lives. At least half of the children born to these poor women became homeless children because they were really unable to raise them. But on this trip to Russia, traces of these three classes could not be found. In a town more than 140 miles from Moscow, she met a mayor's wife, an elementary school principal, and several female workers in a public canteen. The mayor's wife was a local female doctor who also knew a little English. Mrs. Hu only knew that she was the mayor's wife after talking to her for a while, because her clothes were as simple as those of rural women in the western United States, and she only ate black bread and two dishes with soup like other diners. No one could tell her status. According to the mayor's wife, women in Soviet Russia, like men, only know how to work and do not know how to enjoy extravagance and idleness. As she spoke, she raised her feet for Mrs. Hu to see. It turned out that the flat leather shoes she was wearing were only worth one dollar a pair in the United States and were worn by black women. There was also a patch half an inch in diameter on her left shoe.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hu said that before coming to Russia, she heard people say that there were a surprisingly large number of homeless children in Soviet Russia because it was too easy for couples to divorce, and after the divorce, no one was responsible for raising children. But on this trip to Russia, she realized that the story needed to be compared, because when she traveled to Russia in 1912, she rarely saw the footprints of homeless children in the bustling streets, because at that time, the police in the bustling streets ruthlessly beat homeless children with batons. The birthplace of these children was, in fact, poor families, so when you stepped into the slums, you would often be surrounded by dozens of homeless children, who would even rob you of your jewelry and handbags. At that time, it was said that there were more than 200,000 homeless children in St. Petersburg alone, and there were homeless children all over the country. But now, it is said that there are less than 100,000 homeless children in the entire city of Moscow. Although this official report cannot be completely believed, it is a fact that there are fewer homeless children now than in the past. Moreover, this situation is not limited to Moscow. The situation was exactly the same in the places she passed through during her trip to Russia, which was more than one thousand seven hundred miles.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, when Mrs. Hu traveled to Russia, less than 5% of the poor women, who accounted for more than 70%, had received three or four years of education and knew a few words. This was still the situation in St. Petersburg. In rural areas, it can be said that less than one or two in a hundred. But on this same trip, in the streetcars, you could see female workers reading books or newspapers everywhere. It is said that in Soviet Russia, 57.75% of women under the age of 40 are literate. Although women over the age of 40 do not know Russian, they can read books and newspapers in Latin pinyin and write in Latin pinyin. It has also accounted for more than 70%. In today's Russia, there is one thing that is completely different from American women. The more knowledgeable American women are, the more addicted they are to luxury and enjoyment. Soviet Russian women, on the other hand, the more knowledgeable they are, the harder they work, and the simpler their lives become. This is an important transformation of Soviet Russian women in the past twenty-five years that cannot be ignored. On this trip to Russia, Mrs. Hu had some contact with some knowledgeable women and asked them, "The first five-year plan has been completed, and now the restrictions on people's clothing, food, and drink are not as strict as before. So, why don't you wear fashionable clothes and put on lipstick?" A small part of their answers was that it had become a habit, but a large part was that "there are no more prostitutes in Soviet Russia who use beauty to lure people."</p>

<p>— Man Zi</p>
<p>Wild children are looked down upon, because although they are also lovely, innocent, and naturally uninhibited little angels, they have not been recognized by the family for their status and position, and cannot inherit the great lineage, so they become fatherless children. But in a certain period, they will also be valued, because the ancestral lineage law, which cannot be without an heir, compels them to find an heir through exhaustive thinking, and then the wild child becomes a family child.</p>
<p>The facts tell us that in many large families, wild children have become the sons who carry on the lineage, and in many large families, wild children have been abandoned, leaving them to drift and have no one to rely on. This is all dominated by feudal forces. The fortune and misfortune of wild children is indeed a matter of the entire family system, and the mothers of wild children have even more tragic encounters. "Keeping the pearl and discarding the casket" is the most common means. Even if both the pearl and the casket are kept, there is not much good fortune. As for the mother becoming noble because of her son, it is really rare.</p>
<p>The new film "Qingming Season" features a wild child, which constitutes many tortuous plots. The darkness of society and the corruption of the family are contrasted from the negative side; the sense of justice of sympathetic people and the true love of human nature are highlighted from the positive side. A wild child who is valued by Zhao Meng and despised by Zhao Meng is turned upside down, especially the mother of the wild child, who is truly in a situation where she doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. Li Minghui speaks on behalf of many weak women who have been tempted, trampled on, and abandoned in "Qingming Season", and Shen Jun calls for many wild children who have been manipulated and dominated. After watching this, we feel whether the ancestral lineage law can exist? And how should the current law protect wild children? These are all issues that need to be discussed. In history, we can also see several wild children who have done earth-shattering great things and made bright and splendid great contributions. However, what kind of treatment should the government give to the education and sanitation of wild children? What kind of reasonable attitude should society have towards wild children? These are all the answers that "Qingming Season" asks of the audience.</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Great Disturbance That Shook the Students Studying in Japan <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Zi</p>
<p>Pei Manna was slandered for no reason and used all her strength to fight back; Wei Jin pretended to be mentally ill in an attempt to evade responsibility.</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) Ms. Pei Manna is from Quan County, Guangxi. After graduating from Shanghai Art University, she returned to her province to work for two years and served as a teacher at Nanning Provincial Third Girls' Middle School. She came to Japan to study two years ago and is currently studying in the Department of Social Sciences at Tokyo Hosei University.</p>
<p>Her family is not very well-off. Her father passed away early, and she and her younger brother were raised by her great mother through hard work. Therefore, her past life was miserable and difficult. It cannot be said that she has achieved today's achievements without her own efforts and hard work. Due to continuous training and life's tribulations, she has been forged into a tough character.</p>
<p>Her current life is very simple. In addition to attending classes, she stays in the dormitory and reads the books she has planned. Her room is filled with newspapers and magazines, and there have never been cosmetics on the table. She doesn't put on lipstick, doesn't apply powder, and doesn't like to dress up. She has completely shed the typical image of a woman and walks strongly and boldly, and is known as a female soldier. She is sincere and loyal to her friends, has a very clear understanding of society, is not accustomed to family and enjoyable life, is quiet in nature, but also likes to debate with friends or explore various issues, and also participates in group activities when she is free. When she plays, she is very willful. But when she starts working, she becomes strict and serious, especially when it comes to the feudal forces that oppress women and all the old ethics and traditional concepts that despise women, she spares no effort in criticizing them, and she is brave in doing things. As long as she thinks it is beneficial to society, she does it regardless of everything!</p>
<p>She is still young, but she has grasped the correct reason and is moving forward. She often encourages her friends: "The cause of life depends entirely on one's own struggle. As long as a person does not covet vanity, does not rely on others, and is determined to endure hardship, take risks, and constantly hone himself, he will eventually achieve his goal." In this way, her future is very promising.</p>
<p>The following is a conversation I had with her. She has recently been busy dealing with a leaflet that was distributed under a false name to insult her. This incident has caused a sensation in the Tokyo student community and has greatly affected the reputation of female students. Therefore, I visited her about this recently-occurring practical problem.</p>
<p>"What is the truth about the leaflet incident that happened recently? Please give your opinion."</p>
<p>"Ah! Mentioning this matter is embarrassing for me. To be honest, it would be easier for people to believe if it were said by a third party, but it seems not very good to speak if it happens to be the person involved. However, on the other hand, the truth of the matter is only clear to the parties involved. It is very reasonable to disclose the matter truthfully without exaggeration and to analyze it from an objective perspective. This incident has been going on for a month (and is still evolving), providing a lot of information to students studying in Tokyo and giving great stimulation to female students, but there are too few people who understand the truth and use correct criticism. I am excited that you are asking me about this issue today, and I am willing to tell you and my sisters in China from a third-party perspective.</p>
<p>This incident looks like a boring act on the surface, and can be dismissed, but if we recognize it strictly, it can also be regarded as a major problem. If we are satisfied with ignoring it, I am afraid that the victims will follow one after another, because the bankruptcy of reputation is enough to kill people and cut off their paths. Like the past "Ruan Lingyu", she lost her life only because "gossip is a fearful thing". For example, a female student Wang in Tokyo was slandered by a leaflet distributed because she did not accept the love of a man named Chen. Even now, some people still call her an concubine. This is obviously a man's excessive selfishness and intentional fabrication and slander. For example, recently Xiong was also distributed a leaflet with no facts because she did not accept a man's request. She could not bear this poisonous harm, and as a result, she passively ran back to her hometown. This not only fails to get people's sympathy, but also helps the evildoer by saying that she fled in fear of crime. Then, are real women so easily bullied? Are they going to be ruined one by one by that kind of unfounded leaflet?</p>
<p>Speaking of the cause of my leaflet, it is like this: Last year, my fellow villager "Zeng Yi" divorced "Wei Jin" (the divorce notice was published in the Tokyo Student News). Because I have a deeper relationship with her, and said a few fair words in the final negotiations, I was therefore poisoned and hated by him. For a year, he gave me a lot of slander and attacks. I have always ignored it for the sake of peace. However, things happened unexpectedly. He actually went too far and actually committed the crime of borrowing someone else's name."</p>
<p>"Please briefly describe the process of their divorce and the content of this leaflet."</p>
<p>"Speaking of their divorce, it was inevitable, because if the two people cannot love each other, then of course it is better to separate. But the man turned love into hate and forced her to commit suicide twice, wanting her to swallow gold. This can be seen from this. Speaking of the act of distributing leaflets, he first committed the crime of killing people with a borrowed knife. He openly used the name of a third party, Zhao Wenyuan (according to Zhao, Mr. Zeng Tu's friend Wei Jin often regarded him as a rival in love), to print and distribute it, and the wording was extremely fabricated and insulting, such as "introducing boyfriends", "cheating money", and "forging diplomas". Chen Supervisor was also involved in this, because Chen Supervisor also reprimanded him when they divorced. In short, Wei Jin's actions regarded women's reputation as a child's play, only seeking his own happiness, regardless of destroying others. Such a student who bears the heavy responsibility of the country is really heartbroken!"</p>
<p>"Now that things have reached this point, how are you going to deal with it? Has the student supervision office and the women's association responded concretely?"</p>
<p>"After this incident happened, I submitted a letter to our country's official office in Japan, requesting a thorough investigation and strict punishment, and I have already published a statement in the newspaper. The Women's Association and the Hometown Association have also unanimously provided assistance. - According to a friend close to Wei Jin, he is now pretending to be mentally ill in an attempt to evade responsibility, and has been admitted to the hospital for treatment. In this way, friends have expressed sympathy and secretly advised me to forgive him, but now I regard this issue as my own issue, and the main thing is to eradicate the erroneous thinking and the false behavior, and give a head-on blow to the general public who have impure views on women. Men sometimes look for entertainment or vent their anger, but women are greatly affected, or even their entire future will be ruined because of this. It is really chilling... So I am determined to use all my strength to fight and achieve my goal by standing on the interests of women as a whole and protecting the reputation of female students studying in Tokyo. I hope to eradicate this kind of behavior and give Wei Jin a severe punishment so that students studying in Tokyo will not have this kind of behavior again in the future. I hope that everyone will clarify the truth and maintain justice. If I can get my wish, this will not only be Manna's personal fortune, but also a great fortune for all female students studying in Tokyo."</p>
<h3 id="e167">Is it a Human? Is it a Beast? <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>— Snow Shadow</p>
<p>Qi Shi, barely seven years old, already donned her second set of mourning clothes, transforming from an orphan into a sorrowful orphan. Such a frail little girl, having lost both her father and mother, how could she possibly continue to live? In this world where humans and beasts are indistinguishable!</p>
<p>Fortunately, Qi Shi's grandfather didn't follow his son and daughter-in-law, and he so lovingly doted on this little granddaughter, not disliking her in the least because she was a girl. Although he was a poor scholar, over sixty and already aging, his home lacking even the most basic three thatched huts, he was fortunate enough, due to his long-standing poverty, to still hold a clerical position at an inland shipping company, earning thirty-two yuan in legal tender each month. He had joined this company at the age of thirty-five, working there for twenty-seven years, receiving only two salary increases, two yuan each time. He didn't resent his boss; he felt that with society in such a depressed state, having someone willing to provide a meal was already good. When his son was alive, he had enjoyed about seven years of great happiness, with the family's living expenses entirely borne by Ya Zi, his own earnings only needed for his personal expenses. Unexpectedly, his son suddenly died, and the small savings he left behind were only enough to cover his funeral expenses. In less than a year, his daughter-in-law also died, emptying the old man's savings accumulated over the years. Although deeply saddened, he didn't despair. He self-sufficiently raised his granddaughter, continuing to diligently perform his work.</p>
<p>Qi Bao was already studying at a small private school nearby. Although it was less than two hundred steps from home, her grandfather always personally escorted her three times a day: to school in the morning, home at noon, and back to school in the afternoon. Only for the afternoon dismissal, as he couldn't leave the company, he entrusted her to a young mistress living in the same residence. Qi Bao's liveliness and loveliness, as well as her grandfather's kindness and gentleness, were praised by almost everyone on their street. If a person still had a human heart, no matter how much they enjoyed causing trouble, they would never target this grandfather and granddaughter.</p>
<p>One windy afternoon, Qi Bao waited a long time at the school gate, but couldn't see the white-haired old man. Her little stomach was so hungry she couldn't bear it any longer, so she risked running home alone. But her grandfather wasn't home either, only Zhang Ma, the cook, waiting anxiously at the gate. Qi Bao, hearing that her grandfather hadn't returned, didn't want to eat and insisted that Zhang Ma take her to the inland shipping company.</p>
<p>"Look at a madman, look at a madman!" At the gate of the shipping company, a crowd of people gathered, surrounding an old man gesturing wildly and cursing loudly. His face had turned ashen, his old eyes wide open, but the eyeballs had turned red, and white foam was dripping from the corners of his mouth, truly resembling a madman.</p>
<p>"You bone-gnawing beasts! Have you no regard for twenty-seven years of loyalty!"</p>
<p>"Old! Old! Old! How could your father get old? Beasts! You've drained all my energy! Youth, middle age, from black hair I've worked for you until my hair turned white, all my useful energy exhausted, and now you嫌 me for being old!" He stretched his hoarse voice and shouted, tears rolling down his beard like drops of dew. He pointed his finger at the gloomy building, wishing he could pierce through it and point directly at the faces of the people inside. "You beasts! You can't even bear to give me this one mouthful of food! You're so heartless!… You have money to take concubines and send your sons to Japan; can't you spare me these few coins? You heartless beasts!…"</p>
<p>Those who initially thought he was crazy, hearing his coherent words, realized he was a discarded old employee. But who could stand up for him and speak out against the injustice?</p>
<p>"Daddy! Did a beast bite you? Where is the beast?" Qi Bao always thought some beast had truly bitten her grandfather, so she rushed forward, stretched out her little hands, and hugged him tightly.</p>
<p>"Where is the beast? Isn't it inside the building?" Her grandfather's hand was still pointing towards the building.</p>
<p>"Those inside the building are people!" Qi Bao asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>"They are beasts! They are beasts!…"</p>

Since contracting malaria in mid-October this year, although he recovered after three weeks, his left scrotum suddenly became swollen – to a length of more than two inches – and there was a slight pain. It shrinks to its original shape after sleeping at night, but it still feels painful when shaken, and it is still swollen after getting up in the morning. It has been almost a month, and although he has taken hernia pills, it has not been effective. The pain has now been reduced, but due to the swelling, walking is very inconvenient.

<p>Hard Lump in the Left Abdomen</p>

Later, I felt a hard mass on the left side of my abdomen, above my navel. I don't know if I have splenomegaly. I took Chinese medicine - spleen-hardening pills, but it was ineffective.

He died ten days after the abdominal operation. Now I would like to ask: (1) Is this disease hereditary? (2) Can syphilis spread to the liver?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) There are many kinds of jaundice, and the prognosis is different. "Liver disease is an incurable disease" is not logical. Judging from the process, it is probably either "Liver Cirrhosis" or "Acute Yellow Atrophy", both diseases are incurable. (1) Both diseases are not hereditary. (2) Yes, it is called "liver syphilis", but the process is not so fast. If the course of syphilitic liver disease is as fast as described in the letter, it is nothing but "syphilitic liver cirrhosis".</p>

May I ask: (1) What medicine can cure the above symptoms and cure masturbation? (2) (Not recorded.)</p>
<p>:(1) Take "Bromagsin" to cure various symptoms. The key to masturbation is you, if you want to cure it, then cure it, there is no medicine to take.

<h3 id="e168">The End of the Road for Traitors <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Selling one's country for personal glory is the sole ambition of a traitor. Selling the country allows them to hold high positions and enjoy generous salaries. This is indeed considered a shrewd move. Therefore, many unscrupulous individuals disregard the enormity of their crimes, ignoring the curses hurled at them, and persist in their treachery. However, while some have succeeded in achieving personal glory through betrayal, as evidenced by the current batch of puppet officials, big and small, who have risen to prominence, and the arch-traitor Yin, who dominates his own territory as a puppet leader, many others have faced unfortunate circumstances, leading them to a dead end. The number one traitor, Zheng Xiaoxu, once enjoyed a period of得意, but now he has faded into obscurity. He himself never imagined that his old age would be so desolate. As for others who have been kicked away by their masters, they are naturally even more pitiful.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the bandit-Mongolian puppet troops who recently launched a large-scale invasion of Suiyuan. Wang Ying, this rebel, certainly harbored grand dreams of selling his country for personal glory. But what was the outcome? According to Guihua Telegraph: "After the failure of the Wang Ying bandits, they fled with their remnants to the Shimuerte area. Recently, under the orders of a certain party, they were transferred from Shimuerte to Jiabi Temple north of Shangdu. The certain party ordered him to lead several hundred remnants to harass western Suiyuan. Wang requested additional firearms, but the certain party refused. Wang was greatly dissatisfied. Fearing that Wang would defect, the certain party assassinated Wang at the temple on the twenty-first night, and Wang's remnants were immediately disarmed."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, there have been rumors that Wang himself intended to defect. If Wang could have realized his errors early on and led his troops to surrender, he might have been able to wash away the stain of treason. However, blinded by greed, he continued to resist stubbornly, inevitably leading him to his demise. This can be considered a form of retribution for his heinous crimes. Those who hope to taste the rewards of treason should take this as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The Night Watchman <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Fan Jia</p>
<p>These past few nights, I've been hearing the sound of the night watchman again. In the stillness of the cold night air, the sounds of the gong and clapper are clear and steady, as if the watchman's憂鬱 is vented through that copper gong and clapper. I don't like sleeping with my head covered by the blankets, even in winter; but when I hear the watchman's sounds, I can't help but cover my head tightly, hoping I can sleep quietly. The truth is quite the opposite; covering my head only makes my eyes unable to see, but my ears are even more astute. The sound of the watchman seems to be just outside my bedroom window, even resounding beside my pillow.</p>
<p>The watchman is a short, old man with a pair of severe nearsighted eyes. I don't know when he took up this profession. And the townspeople have never valued this profession. He doesn't have a monthly fee for his watchman duties, nor does he have a watchtower to shelter him from the wind and rain. He lives alone in the earth god shrine. Every festival,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>like a beggar, he goes door to door to ask for a little reward money, and some seasonal foods: such as New Year's cakes, Dragon Boat Festival dumplings, and Mid-Autumn Festival mooncakes. At the end of the year, some wealthy families will generously give him some leftovers. He lives such a meager life.</p>
<p>This summer, the old man fell ill and didn't come out to do his rounds for a few days. It just so happened that there were two burglaries in the town during those few days. When the victims realized they had lost something and felt the pain, they suddenly paid attention to the watchman's profession, sending people to责骂 the old man for not doing his rounds because he was sick, and that he would have to compensate for the lost items. This was naturally just talk, or perhaps the person sent there added his own salt and sauce. But the next day, the old man really came out to do his rounds, even though he was still sick.</p>
<p>When cooling off in the summer heat, I saw him, like a toad, walking from the east end of town to the west end, a bamboo tube hanging in front of his chest, and a copper gong in his hand, striking the gong,du du dang dang. When he reached my door, he asked the people sitting there for a cup of tea. Because he was nearsighted, he casually called out "Madam, Grandma, I ask for a cup of tea to drink." He was as pitiable as a beggar.</p>
<p>I don't know who, let out a long sigh, and then someone began to ask him questions. Perhaps he was also tired, so he sat on the stone steps and recounted his life story. He said:</p>
<p>"...Watchman duties have been passed down from my grandfather's generation. It was during my grandfather's time that there was a major burglary in the town, and it was decided by everyone to cancel the monthly fee of one string of cash per household, only asking for a little reward money on festivals. This job has always been difficult, and at my age, I don't have any relatives. One son混s around in the temple grounds as a hooligan, and he doesn't even recognize me, his old man… Those short-lived thieves are also working against me; they stole things after I was sick for a few days…"</p>
<p>After drinking the tea, he continued on his way, striking the gong and clapper. That night, he seemed to be striking the gong with great vigor. When I woke up, I always heard him passing outside the wall. Once, I was even woken up by the sound of the gong.</p>
<p>But the next morning, someone found him lying under a cabbage tree on the east side of town, his face青 and white foam coming from his mouth, already unconscious. They carried him back to the earth god shrine, and he only regained consciousness, telling them sporadically that when he was doing his rounds to the east side of town, he saw someone leaning against the cabbage tree in the distance. He coughed and struck the gong even louder, but that person ignored him. When he rushed over, it felt like he had been struck by a palm, and he became unconscious.</p>
<p>So some people speculated that there were妖s on the ginkgo tree, and brought out some old stories to prove that the tree had been struck by lightning before. Others said that the old man was ill and had made it all up. In short, the night watchman died just like that.</p>
<p>For several months, no one continued the profession, although some people had suggested that each household should still pay a monthly fee to hire a night watchman. Unexpectedly, the old man's son, who混s around in the temple grounds as a hooligan, quietly returned to town. Without caring whether people agreed or not, he went to the earth god shrine to inherit his father's legacy – a bamboo tube, and a copper gong – and started doing his rounds, and he even knew how to sing: "Cold weather in the twelfth lunar month, be careful with fire!" or "Check the front door, prop up the back door." The folk songs remind people to be careful of fire and thieves.</p>
<p>It has been several months since I heard the sound of the gong, and now it sounds very uncomfortable, although many families welcome this diligent watchman. I really want to see that young man. Isn't it very free to be a hooligan? Isn't it a lucrative job to be a hooligan in the temple grounds? But he is willing to take over this profession that is not valued by others.</p>
<p>Now he is coming back from the east side of town, and when he passes outside my wall, he is singing the folk song "Be careful with fire!" Perhaps the wind is blowing outside?</p>
<h3 id="e170">God's Mercy Store <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>In Waller Town, Texas, USA, there is a store that is completely different from ordinary stores. Looking at its signboard is quite astonishing, which reads: "God's Mercy Store." The word "God" is written extra large. Any Christian passing by the store will surely notice these big characters. In front of the store, there is also a large wooden advertisement board, which reads:</p>
<p>"All goods in this store are sold at cost price, without any additional profit. Customers are welcome to make donations at their discretion in addition to the purchase price. The store will be most grateful."</p>
<p>Reading these few lines of advertisement, one can understand the nature of this store. It turns out that the items displayed in this store are sold to customers at the cost price, plus shipping and other expenses, without adding any additional profit. Customers may, if they wish, pay some reward fee in addition to the purchase price, no matter how much, it is up to them. If they don't pay a single penny in addition to the purchase price, they are treated the same. Some customers pay as much as 20% of the goods' price as a reward fee, while others buy at cost price without paying any extra amount. However, the store owner never frowns because of this, nor does he make things difficult. To those who pay a reward fee, he only expresses a simple thank you, without showing any special gratitude.</p>
<p>This store is located in a one-story house made of tin sheets and has a history of twenty-two years. When it first opened, it was very small, but now it has expanded into a large store with several entrances. The items sold include groceries, dry goods, hardware, meat, and various food items. There is also a retail gas station. Ranchers and farmers within forty or fifty miles come by car to support the store, so it is often crowded with customers. In times of economic recession, other stores have sluggish business, but this "God's Mercy Store" still has a thriving business.</p>
<p>The owner of this store is named Pei Weisi. He wears gray pants, a collarless shirt, with his sleeves rolled up, standing behind the iron railing in front of the counter. The hair on his forehead is very sparse, and he is almost sixty years old. His blue eyes and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes give a very humorous and kind impression. He often talks and laughs with customers. Since he established this store, many neighbors and customers have rushed to enjoy this cheap opportunity. Many of them only buy things at cost and leave without paying any extra reward fee. One old customer once said to others: "Pei Weisi is willing to be a fool, but I won't be a fool. Over the years, I have bought things in his store, and I have never paid a penny more than the cost price." However, Pei Weisi still treats this penny-pinching economist the same as other customers and has never shown the slightest dissatisfaction in his words or expressions. One day, this person again purchased many items from the store. As per his old habit, he paid the cost price and loaded the goods onto his truck and left. But in less than a few minutes, he returned to the store, jumped off the carriage, ran into the store, and took out a twenty-dollar bill, handing it to the store owner, saying: "I can't always buy goods at cost price and not give the "God's Mercy Store" a little reward."</p>
<p>Speaking of the motive for Mr. Pei Weisi to open this store, there is a legend. Originally, Mr. Pei was a worker who knelt in the dust of cotton fields picking cotton flowers. He had not received a good education, nor did he have any connection with any church. Twenty-two years ago, while he was working in the field, he suddenly felt a surge of blood throughout his body and received a revelation from God, instructing him to start this kind of business to serve men, women, old, and young, that is, to serve God. It is said that even the name of the store was revealed by God. Mr. Pei once said to others: "I have never been a clerk in a store, nor have I ever thought of opening a store. I received a revelation from God, so I sold everything I owned and opened this store. I never thought about whether I could make a living from this, I only knew to follow God's command. This store has grown steadily. I use all the reward money I get in the store. This is not my wealth, nor is it my business. The bigger the store, the more I can serve." Judging from Mr. Pei's daily words and deeds, he seems very honest, treats people with courtesy, and does not like to exaggerate at all. Sometimes, newspaper reporters want to take his portrait and publish it in the newspaper, but he always refuses. In this way, it doesn't seem like he opened this store to falsely invoke God's name, to create novelty and gain false reputation. But that legend, we can only listen to it with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>Another feature of this store is that the partners in the store do not receive a salary. At the end of each month, Mr. Pei adds up the total amount of reward money paid by customers, and then Mr. Pei distributes it according to the size of each person's job, with the larger ones averaging about four percent. When this store first opened, the prices of goods were indeed much cheaper than other stores, but now many stores in the neighborhood have risen to compete, so the difference with other stores is not much anymore. However, the brand of "God's Mercy Store" has already been established, and most old customers are willing to support that old man Pei Weisi, so the business in his store is always more prosperous than others. Mr. Pei once talked about the various types of customers in the store: "From these people, you can discover many interesting things. There are a few people whose financial power could buy my store outright, but when they buy things, they never pay a penny more than the cost. There are quite a few ordinary people who are very generous, and the reward fees they pay often make me feel that it would be disrespectful to refuse and ashamed to accept."</p>
<p>A store like Pei Weisi's can be called a store with a clear conscience. Are the old clichés of "great bargain," "great sacrifice," and "honesty to all, no double pricing" that "our country" speaks of still worth considering?</p>

<h3 id="e174">Amateur Drama Actor Information "Thunderstorm" in Ye Lucy's Room <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>After the announcement of the third public performance program, rehearsals have been actively carried out in recent days, and the work is very intense. There were originally two rehearsal locations, one is the Ye Yu Drama Actor Association, and the other borrowed the address of the Drama Friendship Society. The three plays "Thunderstorm," "Stupid Pig," and "Demon of Desire" are rehearsed alternately day and night in these two places. Since the general meeting was convened a few days ago to determine the date of the public performance, the work has become even more intense. With three plays rehearsing at the same time, the location is particularly insufficient, so the play "Thunderstorm" has temporarily borrowed Ye Lucy and Zhao Dan's boudoir as a rehearsal location.</p>

<p>In addition to adapting Tolstoy's "The Power of Darkness" into the Chinese-style "Demon of Desire" for amateur drama actors, Ouyang Yuqian also serves as the director of the play. In recent days, he has been adapting the script and rehearsing day and night, and the work is very hard. Shen Ye, the director of "Stupid Pig," also rushes to the amateur to rehearse the play (Song Yizhou takes over during the day), often not returning until 4 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>For this public performance, a commemorative calendar card is being prepared. One side is exquisitely printed with portraits of the actors, and the other side is a 1937 calendar and public school programs, etc., which will be distributed to the audience and students of major secondary schools. Printing is currently underway day and night.</p>

<p>The two rehearsal locations and Zhao Dan's residence are all located on Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Because of the daily and nightly rehearsals, the footprints of many stars can often be seen on Huanlong Road. A small Russian restaurant has also been occupied by amateur drama actors. At lunchtime and dinner, it is often crowded and very lively, so Russian diners are also turned away.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A War Epic with a Price Tag of 2 Million Gold "The Charge of the Light Brigade" Will Be Released Soon <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Since the release of "The Iron-Blooded General," the fame of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland has instantly shone on the silver screen. Therefore, Warner Bros. has decided to spend another huge sum of 2 million gold yuan to produce "The Charge of The Light Brigade." The story is based on the famous work of the great British poet Lord Tennyson, writing about the joint forces of the Three Nations of Turkey, England, and France in the great war with Russia, when 600 elite British soldiers, under the pursuit of artillery fire from the left, right, and front, charged to the peak at the risk of death. The mood is tragic and enthusiastic, which is enough to the earth and weep the gods. The grandeur of its background and the brilliance of its performance are far beyond the reach of the two films "Battlefield Hero" and "The Iron-Blooded General," which depict love scenes, and the cruelty of the Indian massacre of the entire city is beyond the reach of films. The Great World Theater has been scheduled to publicly screen this film around the New Year.</p>
