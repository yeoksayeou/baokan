<p>時評</p>
<h3>國貨展覽與國貨商塲</h3>
<p>— 柳</p>
<p>年來國貨工業發展至如何地步。尙難洞悉。若就本市各區所舉行之國貨展覽會觀之。實不能謂有顯著之進步。此類展覽會。或不足以代表國貨工業之全部。或僅代表其小部門中之一部分。但旣以國貨展覽會為名。聞者不察。以為就此可以覘我國之國貨工業。未免大失望矣。</p>
<p>國貨展覽會之主要目的。原在集合各工廠之新出品。分類陳列。藉供觀摩。覘進步。便比較。增識見。在攻府方面。可因此對出品不良者。督促改良。對出品優美者。提倡保護。俾使我國工業有健全之發展。在另一方面。亦可促進一般人對於國貨工業建設投資之興趣。是以國貨展覽會應擇出品之新穎精美者陳列之。由政府領導國貨工業。每年舉行一次。若今之所謂國貨展覽會。則全以銷售出品為目的。與展覽會之本旨相去遠矣。</p>
<p>惟其如是。故陳列品一以家常日用為主。針織品幾占大半。為便於銷售。定價不得不低廉。因圖價廉而出品之優劣不能計。為急子脫貨。而商品之信譽。亦置而不顧。買者初貪一時之便宜。後則深悔貨物之不經用。抱怨國貨之不良。惡劣印象。乃蒙於國貨之全體矣。</p>
<p>貨品不能無優劣。售價不能無高低。廉價者非精品。理固當然。然如依照製品成本之高低。定價出售。志不在厚利。物求其經用。吾知人必趨之。若一味以厚利為用意。以廉價相號召。惟有使信用愈加失墜而巳。</p>
<p>抑廠商如以售品為目的。似可設立國貨商塲。而在其上加「臨時」「流動」等詞及區域之名以表示其性質。不應藉國貨展覽會之名。以為宣傳。至於國貨展覽會。宜在政府主持指導之下。集合各廠精良及最新出品。愼加甄擇一年一度或定期舉行之。若本巿自民國十七年以來。歲有國貨運動週之舉行。宜將全市國貨展覽會列為運動週中唯一之工作。以覘一年來國貨工業之進步如何。若是。則工廠業得收觀摩切磋之效。而在民衆亦知所奮發。方不失展覽之本旨矣。</p>

<h3>蘇俄反政府案　齊諾維夫等執行死刑　十五名同時槍决情形秘密</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯中央執行委員會主席團昨已拒絕各犯請求恩赦、被吿十六名均已按照原判執行死刑、（二十五日塔斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）齊諾維夫等十五人執行死刑之經過、現尙嚴守秘密、蘇俄當局認為此種死刑之描寫、未免近於野蠻、各犯之財產、皆巳被沒收、「公理報」對於此次死刑之裁判、頗為讚許、並刋登數萬名工人之决議案一起、內對當局之處置、極為贊成云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）今日被搶决之蘇俄前共產黨領袖齊諾維夫氏、卽為世界著名神秘「赤色函件」案之主人翁、當此案在一九二四年發生之時、英國政界之中、曾引起極大之波瀾、因倫敦方面所發現之神秘函件、卽係齊氏以第三國際首領名義、致英國共產黨者、該函內容、據云係訓令英共產黨人設法以激烈手段顚覆英國當時之政府、並從事煽惑英之陸軍、以便達此目的、英政府當卽向蘇俄駐倫敦代辦提出抗議、略稱此種函件、殊與英俄貿易恊定中、所規定蘇俄政府不得參預英國政治活動之條件相違反、當時蘇俄政府卽答覆英國、謂此項函伴、係屬僞造、並辯稱第三國際與蘇俄政府、不得混為一談云云、嗣後英俄關係、因此而益趨惡劣、但此鬨動一時之齊氏函件、其眞相如何、始終未水落石出、恐將與著名之「裘尼斯文件」及「鐵面人」兩大神秘事件、永成歷史上之懸案矣、</p>
<p>按齊氏生於一八八三年、現年已五十三歲、本屬共產黨內部要員之一、同為一九一七年俄國大革命之主動人物、齊氏聞名之始、係在一九〇三年、因其當時曾任數種俄國報紙之主編也、一九〇八年時、以共產黨嫌疑下獄、後與列寗氏同被放逐於瑞士境內、至一九一七年、齊氏與列寗二人同時潛返俄國、德政府因俄國發生革命、則在前綫作戰之俄軍、自必完全瓦解、故特許二人通過德境、齊氏返抵俄境後、卽從事活動、將成立未久之克倫斯基政府推翻、為擁列寗氏主持大計、此後齊氏在俄國之權勢、卽日趨凌替、最後至一九二五年、遂因托羅資基及加米尼夫二氏之被倒而失勢、故齊氏在共黨之內、實屬勞苦功高、故雖於一九二八年及一九三二年、兩次被逐出黨外、但皆因表示懺悔而恢復黨籍、一九三二年時、歐洲盛傳齊氏已死、齊氏亦銷聲匿跡、歷十二個月之久、直至一九三四年基羅夫氏被刺案發生、齊氏之大名、乃復見於報載、蘇俄政府調查國內反革命活動之結果、乃將齊氏及共犯十八名、加以拘捕、經法庭審理後、僅發現齊氏有反革命嫌疑、但與基羅夫氏被刺案、則無佐證、可資定羿、遂判處徒刑十年、並收沒其財產、不料此次竟被判處死刑也、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>德延長兵役一年　陸軍增至百萬人　意國亦增募殖民地駐軍　莫斯科舉行航空大演習</h3>
<p>（柏林）希特勒元首今日令將德國人民軍役期限自一年增至二年、此舉將使德國現役陸軍增至一百萬入、實為蘇俄近將入伍年齡自二十一歲提早至十九歲之答復、蘇俄現役陸軍共一百三十萬人、自入伍年齡提早後、每年可增二十五萬人、（二十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）上項命令係希特勒元首與國防部長白隆培聯名簽署發表、此項命令發表後、將使工作繁劇之德國國防軍各將領、增加更重大之組織責任、目下德國各地、皆擬建築新兵營、並添聘軍官、訓練此項額外兵士、至本年十月、一九一六年級徵兵入伍之後、德國將有服役十二年之常備軍二十萬人、及一九一五年與一九一六年級之兵士各三十五萬强、如再召集大戰以前各年級軍人、則其數額將更為可觀、德國軍隊之總數大約不下一百萬人、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國現有陸軍員額共為六十萬員名、其中半數為職業軍隊、半數則為去年恢復徵兵制度後所徵募之新兵、今茲延長兵役年限之後、則其平時軍額、自當隨之增加、而在戰時所可動員之後備軍員額、尙不計算在內、查德國精壯男子、生於一九一四年者、計五九八·〇〇〇人、一九一五年者四六七·〇〇〇人、一九一六年者、三五四·〇〇〇人、一九一七年者、三一七·〇〇〇人、一九一八年者三三一·〇〇〇人、一九一九年者、四九二·〇〇〇人、一九二〇年者、六四七·〇〇〇人、合計三·二〇六·〇〇〇人、德人體格强健、其不合兵役資格者、當佔極少數、至多不過什一而已、由此觀之、茍謂雄據歐陸之德國、擁有百萬貔貅、自非過甚之詞、矧德國軍事工業、在歐洲各國中、堪稱首屈一指、以其出品、供給此偉大陸軍之需要、而國內各種經濟組織轉瞬之問、亦可從事調整、置於戰事狀態之下、則希特勒元首一紙命令、卽使德國一躍而為歐洲最强大之陸軍國家者、豈非昭然若揭、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>德國防部長　頒布實施辦法　授意各報抨擊蘇俄</h3>
<p>（柏林）國肪部長白隆培將軍、頃頒布部令、將義務兵役年限、延長辦法、付諸實施、按照此項辦法、至一九三七年七月一日時、德國現役陸軍員額、將達一百二十萬名之最高數、但至一九三八年十月一日時、則因入伍新兵、係屬一九一七年出生男子之故、（是年出率最少）陸軍員額、將减至九十萬名、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國總理今日頒布新令、德國國防軍之實際服務期限、已由一年增至兩年、此項新令根據現行國防法所規定、關於此項新令之施行細則、將由國防部長及陸軍總司令白隆培將軍頒布、國社黨公報今日版載有下列評語、「奥林匹克和平大聚集雖在柏林舉行、德國亦曾使國際人士目覩新德國之和平與秩序、但殘酷內戰及經濟爭鬥在在皆是、國際上不少各種團體、意欲牽引世界入於共產之紛亂、更欲以武力使之成功、在過去三年中、國社黨已將德國在布爾什維克之殘殺破壞之內爭中救出、國社黨治下之安寗、實足以增加德國經濟發展及恢復繁榮、當德國國社黨治下之努力於建設、而西班牙則陷於共黨所釀成之沙漠、國社黨保證國內和平成功、同時德國軍備亦可保證國外之和平達同一成功地位、歷史啟示吾人在必要時作絕大犧牲、仍勝於陷於布爾什維克主義之紛亂局面、在蘇俄帝國主義及其武力威脅之下、德國為保證本國之和平及其文化、將取相常步驟、先保證其自由與獨立」云、（二十四日國民社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）國社黨將於九月八日至十四日在紐倫堡舉行黨務大會、同時衆院亦將舉行重要會議、其議程中之主要事項、為通過關於德國靑年前途之法律、衆信凡在某年齡以上之兒童、不分階級或敎育、均將照意國巴里拉國之辦法、使之離其家庭與父母、為國家服務、聞男童將受半軍事之訓練、女子將受家政耕種看護之訓練、俾他日堪勝新日耳曼國母親之任云、（二十五日路透社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）政府頃决定將兵役期限自一年加至兩年、事前、國社黨當局、示意各報、對於蘇聯整軍經武情形、激烈攻擊、藉向國內外證明、蘇聯此種行動、實以德國為其直接對象、同時各宣傳機關、則在舊擋案中、尋覓各項統計數字、及蘇聯當局往日所發表之宣言、藉以證明蘇聯陸軍、係屬革命主義之軍隊、以故德國不得不將兵役年限延長、以為之備、按德國近年迭次所採軍事措置、胥以蘇聯為口實、例如去年三月十六日、政府宣佈恢復義務兵役制度之時、其所據理由、係蘇聯現役軍隊、共有九十六萬員名、本年三月七日、德國廢止羅卡諾公約、進兵萊茵河區域、係以法俄互助公約威脅德國為辭、迨至最近、西班牙內亂爆發、蘇聯又將陸軍入伍年齡、予以减低、德國遂自謂已在各方面感受威脅矣、目前兵役年限、旣已延長、德國陸軍員額、自必隨之增加、其數字雖較蘇聯為低、但以德國經濟組織較為完備之故、儘足與蘇聯相頡頏、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）各報對於德國參加不干涉西班牙內亂恊定之舉、雖一致表示滿意、但對於該國延長兵役年限一層、則大都表示憂慮、社會黨機關報「人民報」、以為德國此舉、性質至為重要、為今之計、法國務當再行提出縮减軍備之建議、「蓋以德國　長兵役年限之後、世界各國軍備競爭運動、業已轉入一重要階段、此在國際上所可引起之反響與後果、原不難想像得之、各國民族苟欲加以防止、則惟有出於最後之努力、經由唯一眞實有效之途徑、藉以遏制此項軍備競爭運動、途徑維何、卽由關係各國締結軍縮公約、逐漸裁减現有軍備、並規定監察辦法是也、關於此層、自須喚起世界輿論、俾為和平効力、然則發　振瞶、以為世界倡者、固無出法國人民陣綫之右者矣、小日報載稱、德國兵役年限延長之後、必有性質更為嚴重之事發繼之發生、「吾人茲所預測、若果不誤、則希特勒不久必將宣佈、德國擬對蘇俄作「預防性質之戰爭」矣、德國雖已聲明接受不干涉西班牙內亂協定、但此項宜言、已因兵役年限延長一舉、失其價值、今日者、德國軍艦已巡弋於地中海上矣、安知德國百萬貌貅、不將明日在歐洲大陸行施警察樣乎、」晨報載稱、「德國兵舉、對於他國軍備制度、必將自動發生影響、此乃顯血易見者、」右派斐伽羅報載稱、德國朝甫表示接受不干涉協定、夕卽决定延長兵役年限、其時問相去、何短促若是、夫德國所表示之妥協精神、事前為一般人所意想不到者、歐洲各國當局、藉以獲得俄頃之寬慰、惜乎此種妥恊表示、僅若曇花一現、而睛天霹靂、卽隨之而起」云云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國人士　認為司空見慣　不必提付國聯討論</h3>
<p>（倫敦）政界人士頃宣稱、德國延長兵役年限之舉、不能提付國聯會處理、則以該國去年恢復義務兵役之舉、卽係違反凡爾賽和約之行為、此次幷無新穎違約事實故也、且此類舉動、驟視之、性質似極重大、但按之實際、則亦不若一般人想像之甚、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國布特勒元首下令、將兵役年限、由一年增至二年之後、此問政界人士、莫不大為驚異、不安之念、油然而生、均謂當此歐洲時局錯綜已甚之際、德國遽爾採此次議、殊足駭人聽聞、此在右派人士以為蘇聯人民委員會近會决議、該國新兵入伍年齡、應自二十一歲减至十九歲、德國此舉、乃係對俄而發、自屬適合情理、但在左派與穩健派人士、則認德國當局、早已作此决定、今不過以蘇聯之决議為口實耳云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>粵黨政軍聯合紀念週　蔣委員長報吿詞原文</h3>
<p>廣州訊、蔣委員長二十四日在粵聯合紀念週報吿詞原文如下、</p>
<p>各位同志、今天藉此紀念週的機會、將對於「建設廣東為三民主義模範省」的意見、向各位扼要的報吿、現在我們要怎樣要努力來改進廣東現實的情况、建設一個三民主義的模範省呢、當然我們黨政軍學各界同志、大家要努力、使黨務能够健全、政治能够淸明、軍事能够整理、敎育與經濟能够發展、尤其是要將中正說的、（一）剷除貧汚、（二）禁絕烟賭、（三）母奪民利、這三項首要的急務、先能認眞做到、但是這些事情、我相信大家已經十分注重、而且正在努力去做、不待重複的再說、今天中正所要說的、是我們黨政軍學各界同志、今後建設三民主義的模範省、所應當共同努力的一個積極的基本任務是什麼、換句話說、目前建設之初、從何處着手做起、我以為最要的急務在千頭萬緒之中、莫過於建設新省、社會秩序、造成新的社會風氣、就是轉移風氣、振作人心、自中正到廣東以後、覺得这兩個星期以來、由於黨政軍各界同志共同的努力、已經將廣東整個社會的秩序、恢復起來、一切比較有條理了、但是大家要曉得我們現在所已經做到的只是恢復了原有的舊秩序而已、並沒有進一步將現代社會的新秩序建設起來、現在所已恢復的這個舊秩序、和二三十年前、前淸時代的情形差不多、這並不是我所說現代社會的秩序、所以我們今後一定要更進一步、將現代社會的新秩序、很迅速的在廣東建設起來、具體的說、就是要大家改革過去一切不好的風氣習慣思想行動、將舊秩序改為新秩序、將舊風氣轉為新風氣、將舊生活變為新生活、必須這件事先做到了、然後各方面一切的建設工作、才可以迅速推進、三民主義的模範省、也可以儘快的建設成功、大家要曉得、我們要建築一個現代國家、並不一定要怎樣精良的武器、與强大的軍備、最要緊的、還是要一般國民有高尙的道德、整個國家有高尙的人格、只要我們一般國民和整個國家的人格、能够提高、雖然沒有精良的武器和强大的軍備、外國人就不敢來輕侮我們、更不敢來侵略我們、我們一定可以建設一個獨立自由的三民主義現代國家、卽如歐洲有許多小國、他們都沒有强大的武力、甚至國內沒有軍隊、只有警察、但是因為他們一般國民的道德非常充實、整個國家的人格、也就因此提高、受人尊視、鄰近的帝國主義者、想輕侮他也不能輕侮、要侵略他也不敢侵略、這就是最顯明的例證、古人說、「人必自侮而後入侮之、」我們現在之所以如此受人家的輕侮侵略、從根本上講起來、並不是由於軍隊不多、武器不好、實在是因為我們一般國民智識落後、尤其是道德墮落、在生活習慣思想行動各方面的弱點太多、因自侮而招致外侮、所以我們要抵禦外侮、建設現代國家、必須正本淸源、提高一般國民的道德人格、就是要建設現代社會秩序、將我們國家地位、從根本上提高起來、這是我們要建立國家所必須遵循的途徑、也就是我們今後努力建設三民主義的樓範省之着手的要點、大家或許覺得我所講的這個道理、不免太粗淺空洞、要充實國力、避免侵略、似乎沒有那麼簡單容易、但是我要吿訴各位、我們要想建築一個現代國家、非先提高一般國民的道德人格、就無從做起、尤其要廣東建築一個三民主義的模範省、據我兩個星期以來研究的結果、認為目前第一件重要的事、就是要趕緊建設一個新的廣州、就是要改造廣州社會秩序、以轉移廣州風氣、和振作全國人心、除此之外、再沒有其他的辦法、（未完）</p>

<h3>防治螟蟲蚜蟲和蝗蟲的有效方法（中）</h3>
<p>— 浙江大學農學院院長吳福楨</p>
<p>一，要工作得時　譬如點燈，必須在螟蛾初發生時就點，否則大部螟蛾巳行產卵，誘殺牠也沒有益處；又如採卵，必須在初產卵時採除，否則大部的卵塊巳經孵化。採下的卵塊盡是空卵塊，實際上也毫無益處。</p>
<p>二，要通力合作　如一處點燈，而他處不點，則各處的螟蛾都飛集這點燈的一處，以致點燈附近的秧田，滿產卵塊；又如一處採卵他處不採，則在他處的螟蟲成長化蛾後，仍會飛到採卵的地方，以致採卵的功效，往往不能顯著。</p>
<p>三，要工作澈底　螟蟲的繁殖力極大，前面巳經講過，如果我們對於採卵，捕蛾，掘稻根等工作做得不澈底，則殘留少數的螟蟲，不久就可繁殖到極大的數目；鄉間農民往往說治螟工作徒勞無功，這就是工作不澈底的緣故。</p>
<p>（乙）蚜蟲</p>
<p>蚜蟲的名稱各地亦不統一，有的地方呌膩蟲，有的地方呌油蟲。牠的種類很多，有的為害各種蔬菜，有的為害各種果樹，有的為害各種作物；不過牠們的生活習性，大都相彷，所以防治方法亦差不多。現在將最普通的棉花蚜蟲作為代表，講述於次：</p>
<p>（一）蚜蟲的一生</p>
<p>蚜蟲是漸進變態的昆蟲。牠的一生，有卵，稚蟲，成蟲三個時代。成蟲因季節和遷移的關係，形態上分有翅無翅兩型。繁殖有胎生卵生兩法，牠的繁殖力非常强大，一年能生二三十代，普通在春季的時候，都行胎生，繁殖生出來的蚜蟲都是雌蟲。此種母蚜，不用雌雄交配，卽能胎生子　。此種生殖方法，稱為處女生殖。一個母蚜，平均能生三十三個子蚜。子蚜在氣候適宜，食料充足的時候，經過四五天又能生殖第二代子蚜。我們照這生殖速度作理想的推算，假設一個母蚜，從五月到九月，所生殖的子孫，都經長大，就能達二，三四五，七三四，一八八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇之多。這些棉蚜如果照每個體積一立方公厘計算，則堆積起來，比我們所住的地球體積還要大點。這種偉大的繁殖力，實在令人可怕！所以一處棉田裏有了一兩個棉蚜，若不趕速撲滅，不久就會滿田皆是棉旣了。</p>
<p>胎生的雌蟲，大部無翅；但是到了要遷移的時候，就會生出有翅雌蚜，以便從甲處遷判乙處。到了十月下旬的時候，處女生殖停止進行。而生雌雄兩性的蚜蟲。雄蟲有翅，雌蟲無翅，雌雄支配後，就行產卵。一個雌蚜所產的卵，多則十一二個，少則三四個，這種卵卽在田間植物上過冬。到了明年三月間，天氣和暖以後，就孵化為第一代的雌性蚜蟲，寄生在薺菜上，用處女生殖的方法繁殖子孫，以後就遷移到棉花上或各種瓜類上為害。</p>
<p>（二）蚜蟲的有效防治方法</p>
<p>防治蚜蟲的方法，我們根據上面所述的情形，可分兩個步驟：第一個步驟就是除卵；第二個步驟就是除蟲</p>
<p>（一）除卵——棉蚜產卵最盛的時期是在十一月中旬，如果我們在他產卵以前，把棉株拔去晒乾當作燃料燒掉，就可减少牠產卵的機會。棉株拔去之後，再行冬耕，使遺落在田裏的棉花枝葉，都耕入土中；同時將田邊的雜草劇除焚燬，則過冬的蛛卵，就可撰滅乾凈，來年蚜蟲也就不會發生了。</p>
<p>過冬的蚜卵，在三月間就孵化，牠孵化後犬都在薺菜上寄生，所以我們在早春的時候，如果把這種野草剷除焚燬，則雖有殘餘的過冬蚜卵，亦可消滅凈盡。</p>
<p>（二）除蟲——所謂除蟲，就是撲滅蛛蟲的稚蟲及成蟲。因為蛛蟲身體很小，並且是具吸收口器的昆蟲，所以我們必須應用一種藥劑，接觸到牠的身上，使牠死亡。藥劑的種類很多，最有效而最經濟的有下列三種，現在分述於下：</p>
<p>A，棉油乳劑——此劑的配合量，為石鹼一斤，淸水二斤，棉油二斤半。調製法：先將石鹼打成小塊，加氣水煮沸，使牠溶解；同時將棉油放人鍋中，慢慢加熱。待棉油熱至將沸未沸之時（的攝氏七十度左右）卽徐徐倒入熱殮液中，並用木棍急速攪拌，務使十分混合，直至成為半流動的乳狀液為止。此液成為母液，施用時須再加水八十倍稀釋。加水稀釋時，應先用二三倍之溫水，慢慢加入，並用木棍急急攪動，務使十分混和，然後再加冷水至八十倍時為止。此種稀釋乳液，務須用噴霧器噴射於蟲體，否則無效。棉蚜平時喜聚集於葉的反面，故噴射時，宜用彎曲之葉底噴頭。噴霧器，殃在中央農業實業所已有出口，輕便靈活，價錢亦很公道，大家可以前去購用。</p>
<p>B，火油乳劑——此劑的配合量，為肥皂一兩，淸水一斤，火油二斤。其調製及使用法，可參照上述棉油乳劑處理。不過此劑施用時，加水稀釋倍數，以三十至四十倍為度。</p>
<p>C烟草水——取烟葉一斤，加水十五斤，浸漬一盡夜卽成炳革水。用噴霧器噴射於蚜蝨體上，亦可把牠殺死。</p>
<p>以上三種藥劑的原料，到處皆有，調製施用，亦很便利，各地如果有蚜蟲為　，可任擇一種實行防治。</p>

<p>前晚抵滬　今晚晉京</p>
<p>賀氏下榻天潼路新亞酒店、前晚抵滬時、因事先知者甚鮮、僅淞滬警備司令楊虎·接駐日大使許世英電、偕秘書王之南往迎、並於當晚、在國際飯店設宴、為賀氏洗塵、賀夫人及公子亦同行歸國、尙有駐土使館隨員李耀南、調任駐日使館隨員、隨行至日本登岸、賀氏昨晨接見外交部駐滬辦事處主任周珏及張夢齡等多人、並出外訪友、午應親戚宴、擬今日往謁立法院長孫科、今晚乘十一時夜特快車晋京、謁張外長、報吿一切、</p>

<p>土對我國　極表同情</p>
<p>繼謂土總統凱末爾大將曁一般朝鮮人士、對我國現在處境、極具同情心、蓋土國在歐戰前、亦如我國、經舉國奮發、始成新興國家、土國有數千年歷史、現亟求發揚其古文化、推溯其源、係出回紇突厥、故欲發揚其固有文化、須從我國書本考蹬、於是當局乃鼓勵一般學者敎授、積極從事研究我國文化、一方排除阿拉伯波斯文化、</p>
<p>土國外交　商務情形</p>
<p>賀氏續談、土國外交、應付得策、於十年前、卽已與蘇聯發生友好關係、最近一年、英國又與言好、因此、土國所視為關鍵之海峽問題、得以解决、至於該國商務、情形特殊、係採「求償制」、卽統制性質、凡與一國貿易、彼向土國輸出貨物之國家、必須輸入同等價値之土貨、目的在求相抵、而防現金外溢、</p>

<p>賀氏旋答記者問、謂、關於編訂中土商約事、外部係命駐瑞士胡世澤公使、在日內瓦方面進行、本人在土、與該國當局、自亦談及、惟因土國對外貿易、旣係採「求　制」關係、我國內部、必須先有組織、故雖有談判、但尙無决定、本人此次回國、當與政府當局、尤其如實業部關於此點、從長商量、現我國在土、全無商務、僑民亦絕少、故除中土商約外、同時須另締居留條約、卽允許兩國入民、自由僑居、唯此事因未奉外部正式訓令、須此次回國請示、决定後進行、</p>
<p>否認駐土　使館撤銷</p>
<p>記者嗣叩以外傳駐土使館之撤銷、及渠（指賀氏）將在國內任職之說、賀氏答、此說絕對不確、且土國亦已决定遣使我國、前經派定福德培氏、惟因經費預算問題、致遲遲未能實現、延至本年七月、始經閣議通過、人選須重派、本人深感辦理外交、必須專門人材、以予之力、恐不克勝任、本人回國後、使館館務、暫由參事蕭吉榮代辦云、</p>

<h3>貢獻給國貨女訪問員的芻言</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>最近上海婦女會，籌組婦女服用國貨團外，更舉辦國貨家庭訪問招請女訪問員，向各家庭間探訪勸用國貨等情，此舉不侫極表贊同，認為法良意善—因為婦女本為家庭間的主政者，家庭內飲食服用一切物品，又全由主婦掌理之，今以女子充訪問員，沿門挨戶的向各家主婦訪查而兼勸導，那末對於國貨的推銷上，必能獲得顯著的成效，而收事半功倍的良果，原因是；以訪問員與各家主婦，旣為同性，對於談話上必多便利，苟能諄諄勸導吿誡，尤能獲得信仰興諒解，較之以男子勸勉婦女，其格格不入之情况，遠不相同了。不過不佞對於女訪問員，尙有貢獻兩點，不揣　陋寫在下面，以供採納：</p>
<p>一，女訪問員年齡，以中年婦女為最適宜，因為年事過輕的，人家認為少不更事，甚且加以揶揄，過長又認為思想落伍了，至於出言，尤宜婉轉而警惕，諄諄曉以利害，必使聽者有感於中，自然發生愛國思想，而盡訪問勸勉之責。</p>
<p>二，女訪問員胸前，應佩徽章，便於深入閨闥，詳察室中一切物品，縱然遇有全室器具或食品，均為舶來品或大批私貨時，亦當從容苦諫，以現存者食盡用敝為止，不准再買，以免處罰，同時並須指導可為代替的精良國貨的購處，使人家不致誤購，切忌疾言厲色，惱羞成怒，反生惡感！</p>
<p>其他關於女訪問員本人的服裝和言行，都應當先期嚴密自檢！是否奉行國貨信條，毫無抵觸？因為本人以身作則，才得感化他人啊。</p>

<p>這個年頭兒，國貨眞正交了好運氣，東也提倡國貨，西也提倡國貨，尤其是婦女界更加高興去參加這救國的國貨運動。上海婦女會，旣然組織了一個婦女服用國貨委員會，埋頭努力的正在幹這提倡國貨工作。最近上海市國貨運動聯合會，又通函國貨工廠和國貨公司的經理先生，敦勸他們的夫人，一致加入最新組織的婦女服用國貨會。由國貨界領袖的眷屬，來領導這種服用國貨工作，是極有意義，極有價値。吾想這般國貨界領袖的夫人，都是以賢內助著稱於社會，平日旣帮助丈夫，做了許多的工作，現在又要帮助丈夫來做提倡國貨的工作。本來，丈夫一天到晚盡瘁於國貨事業，為國貨爭到許多的光榮，那麼，做夫人的，極應該跟了丈夫來努力服用國貨，天下斷沒有丈夫製造了國貨，而夫人反歡喜推銷外貨的。所以國貨界領袖的夫人，來提倡國貨，推銷國貨，服用國貨，是天經地義，最合理，最切實有效的事情。不必等待丈夫來敦勸加入，吾想一般夫人們，都要自動的欣然加入，好使賢伉儷在同一努力國貨運動的旗幟下宣勞一下。</p>
<p>吾們還想更進一步，不但夫人們加入婦女服用國貨會，便算了事。不加入便罷，加入以後，要切實奉行，買一件物品，用一件器皿，先要默念一下，是不是中國貨？是不是眞正的國貨？檢點要認眞，調查要嚴格，不但自己要頂眞自己，同時還要勸導親戚，勉勵家人，個個都要在服用國貨旗幟下努力。不怕舌敝唇焦，不怕煩勞，更不怕人家討厭取笑，無疑地毅然决然地同你親愛的丈夫，來幹這有價値的國貨運動。到那一天國貨暢行，外貨絕跡，便是夫人們的功德圓滿。</p>
<h3>「國貨在國民經濟上之地位」讀後感</h3>
<p>— 孟昭</p>
<p>國貨演講運動—的確是非常時期裏迫切的一件事！使國人聽到認識國貨播音的意義，而能每飯不忘，深入人心！其效甚宏！余讀仰堯先生，「國貨在國民經濟上之地位」演講稿，不禁感慨系之。</p>
<p>同行必妒！這好像中國特具的鐵律？尤其是國貨事業，不思連絡團結，羣策羣力改進！一味妒忌！仿冒，破壞中傷，以致互相攻訐，時有所聞，試問國貨界內部散漫！事業前途，更有何望？徒减低同胞愛用國貨的信仰力！而國貨與國民經濟，永無聯繫之望，此其一。</p>
<p>欲求國貨的積極發展，研究國人愛惡心理，確是要著！茍國貨迎合國入心理，受到歡迎！那麼國人的國貨心理建設，實在是最偉大的力量！誠如潘先生所說：「我國國貨之大病，在閉門造車，在私心自用，不迎合一般用戶之心理，以致所有出品不合銷各地……」哉斯言，如此觀來，不研究用戶的心理，亦難操勝券此其二。</p>
<p>一般商販，亦應反省！身為中國入，應販中國貨！斷不能為虎作倀！替洋貨做推銷員！掘自己經濟歿落的墳墓！此其三。</p>
<p>消費的人，應知愛用國貨，金錢仍是流在國人手裏，楚弓楚得，原無所用共考慮，而改革懵然用外貨為時髦的惡劣心理！人人知道斯義，纔會人人愛用國貨，處處學强國人民氣節，國無不興，家無不盛！而國民經濟地位，自富裕而鞏固了！此其四。</p>
<p>不購用國貨，不予核銷開支的法則，非但政府機關應如此，卽一般工，商，敎育等機關，如庶務處辦用物，查無確實是國貨發票憑證的，亦一律不准報銷，照此辦法，以後才能改弦易轍，誠誠實實的採辦國貨了！此其五。</p>
<p>上述諸端，是筆者讀了仰葊先生的演講稿後，所發生的意見與感想！</p>
<h3>秋與國貨</h3>
<p>— 魏思故</p>
<p>一年四季在循環着，人們經過了溫和的春，炎熱的夏，現在又到了凉爽的秋。</p>
<p>秋令是凉爽的，並且跟在秋的後面，還有冷酷的冬。但，時令雖然是這樣變化着，人們愛國的心却不可和時令一樣，變成凉寒！變成冷酷！應該始終保守着同樣的熱度。</p>
<p>所以在夏天旣已知道採用國貨，現在到了秋天仍然要用國貨，如像衣襪鞋帽……這些在換季的時候必須添備的，當然依舊要抱着從前的宗旨：『非國貨不用。』</p>
<p>還有，到了秋天，惡蚊要傳染瘧疾！而人在夏天多食了瓜果，又要發生痢症。……道些都要預防和療治，我再順便介紹一聲五洲藥房的國貨巨枝蚊香，和國產的治痢新劑安痢生」吧。</p>
<h3>兩大國貨毛絨應市</h3>

<p>（七月六日）本喀城第二次大戰、係對英印聯隊、實力更為完整、早間下雨、天氣頓覺凉快、吾人均色然以喜、良以吾隊每遇天熱塲硬、卽無佳妙表演、且旬來在仰光每賽必有微雨、塲地微滑、不大泥濘、極利我方施展、積習成慣、此日前第一賽踢來不如己意、非無因也、今日雖天不造美、至賽時仍雨下絲絲、惟觀衆幷不因之而裏足、盛况不减前日、開賽時我隊列陣如左、上半時二比一、結果二比一、立功者惠堂、</p>

<p>葉北華　孫錦順　李惠堂　馮景祥　曹桂成</p>
<p>我隊第一戰無良好印象、今日乃改變陣容、後防因江柏在前方毫無功績、乃綢之左衛、亞輝病後力弱、仍未復原、因以榮照居中、顯源在右、前鋒北華桂成出任邊陲、景祥自棉蘭傷膝後、停戰幾將一月、今日重現色相、實予前綫以非常助力、球塲以雨多、頗有泥滑之嘆、開賽不十分、卽由惠堂因中路短傳得法、從左鋒地位斜取一城、繼後敵方反攻甚劇、幸家平身手靈活、疊挽危球、出神入化、有若天助、但久禦之下、卒有一失、角球中負去一球、不旋踵、吾人前綫又呈活躍、由惠堂遠射再奏一功、上半時二比一佔勝、易陣後、雙方均有攻守、戰情緊張、雙方守門、屢施神技、觀衆咸嘆觀止、直至完局、再無得失、是日我隊表演進步、尤以前鋒推進神速、射門美妙、家平今日守護得力、為此間人士所贊美、其餘諸子、均中規蹈矩、受人激賞、賽畢復各得銀盾小牌一個、由惠堂致詞伸謝、乃忽忽返寓人浴、預備卽晚八時乘火車入孟買也、</p>
<p>（七月七日）喀城與孟買、一東一西、相去一千三百餘里、車行需三十八小時始達、吾人昨賽賽畢、於忽忙中入浴、拾蠱行裝、八時半抵車站、急進晚膳、九時乃與歡送者握別啟行、車均有臥榻、五人佔一廂、與他處不通、故欲把晤淸　、非待車抵途中車站不可、蘭平時天氣炎熱、烈日蒸人、此一日兩夜之車程、最為吃苦、幸今日雨下連綿、淸凉終日、昨宵且須蓋上羊毛毯、以禦寒風、早午晚三餐、均在餐車購食、途中停站甚多、故不感寂寞、或相見難之苦也、</p>
<p>和孟買選手</p>
<p>（七月八日）孟買城號為「印度之門」、西來者必經斯地、淸晨七時半起來盥洗、拾理行裝畢、孟買城卽在目前、來站歡迎者、足球總會職員、我國領事、僑界領袖多人、站中一時嘈雜紛亂、攝影畢、卽出站、走進「忌連」大旅店、略事休息、卽赴僑團歡迎大會、行禮如儀、各代表殷殷訓勉、茶會後乃返寓、準備下午與本城選手作南遊最後一次之角遂、兩日來車間久困、今日抵步卽賽、鑒於吾之戰績優異、未嘗一敗、殊恐在此最後一着失足、造成一簍功虧之恨、故各人均慄然危懼、多事養息、不敢外出閒遊、五時半出塲、此間塲地狹小、觀衆祇近萬、聞已為　城最高紀錄、其足球熱由是觀之、實遠不若喀爾咭打也、與市長及中德兩國領事握手後、乃佈陣應戰、上半時二比一、結果各三和局、立功者惠堂二、　順一、</p>

<p>兩陣對圓、鳴笛開職、對方泰半為軍人、其戰術與港滬英軍大同小異、球藝已佳、氣力尤覺充足、甫一接觸、吾人卽知勁敵當前、殊不易與、靡不小心翼翼、謹愼將事、上半時由余與順相繼立功、家平大意失守一城、休息時吾隊二比一佔勝、易地冉戰、我隊後防漸形弛懈、連因天生江柏兩番失誤、於十五分內連食一球、反勝為收、是時天復轉變、大雨傾盆、走踢維艱、前鋒雖屢屢射門、均為其守者救出、或中橫柱、或過高、或過斜、如為神為之掩護、當是危急之際、滿以為不敗紀錄、必喪於今日最後一塲、無可倖免、於是前方射鬥之心益急、愈急則準繩愈失、徒勞無功、幸天不絕人、臨完塲前七分、敵衛用手救球被罰十二碼、由余執行命中、然巳揑下一把大汗、能和局以終、眞幸運兒也、</p>
<p>是日我隊表演、為求竟全功起見、遂過事認眞、反無精彩、前鋒尙覺可人、後防位置錯亂、所負三球、都因守衛漏踢而失、殊為不値、然九死一生、在希望稀微中、能挽回不敗之好譽、亦不幸中之　幸、晚承足球總會開餐舞會歡宴、昔樂悠揚、觥籌交錯、微醉後、舞態婆娑、一堂共興、鐘嗚二下、尤不覺夜之深也、</p>
<p>按吾人五月初句離國、迄今不及七旬、二十七戰四和未敗、稱雄亞州一帶、戰績可　難能可貴、且舟車困頓、酬酢繁忙、尤其餘事、回首前塵、歷歷如在眼前、眞足慰忭也、有暇常為文細述南遊觀察所得、及各地足球岐異之點、以補余前此紀事之所遺、想亦球國迷民所樂覩也、</p>

<h3>紗花　收貨力薄　陳花漲後大跌　末盤為四十一元半　比上月猛降十一元</h3>
<p>昨陳花為最後一幕、市態依然不振、實因收貨者缺乏、末盤價為四十一元半、比上月之高峯、猛降十一元、此種趨勢、使人可怕也、至於新棉、通記又來大量翻空、然市氣尙平、實則一般散戶紛起扒補、日商亦來抵進、午後檯面帶緊矣、</p>

<h3>現紗廠存已薄　標紗市氣穩固　本月紗末盤較七月跌七元半　其餘各月市呈近堅遠疲之局</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午回、趨勢略形平定、蓋以現紗生意尙堪支持、各廠存紗减少、故人心尙安、惟一般空戶鑒於棉價低廉、壓力未退、本月份為最後一日營業、據云某某公司獨收四千包、售於蜀帮說、因此午後市氣轉昂、末盤價為一百九十七元四角、比上月之二百〇四元力角、跌去七元半云、</p>
<p>標紗晨跌午回</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、海外紗花狀况不佳、人氣暗淡、各月繼續下落、二盤後本月份紗為最後一日營業、市傳大生廠二十支紅魁星紗絡續交出已有四千包、將其掃數收回之說、於是市勢轉昂、徐徐回升、遠期帶高、迨至收盤、聞大阪三品紗市不振又轉軟化、聚興同豐賣出甚夥、惟　德獨力購進殊多、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌五·六·七角、本月勿動、午後開盤、本月份紗某某公司準備收回、致檯面轉挺、遠月帶起、同時現紗客方辦胃尙健、人氣略堅、但賣方仍來壓迫、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲三·四·五·九角至一元、查賣出通記三千三百包、衆興三千〇五十包、裕大三千四百包、大豐一千八百包、同豐二千一百包、長豐五千六百五十包、生源一千九百五十包、恒益一千八百包、合興一千六百包、買進大孚三千九百包、明德四千一百包、長餘一千三百五十包、潤康二千一百五十包、協成一千八百包、同和二千七百包、信誠二千七百包、大豐一千一百五十包、瑞大一千〇五十包、森康一千五百包、茲將一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<p>昨日粉市、始疲終秀、形成盤旋之局、上午開盤後、以洋麥報訊、芝加哥小去六七角、坎拿大小八九角、利物浦小一便士弱、初時人心、依然瘦弱、遠近一致跌三分左右、惟連日下游、盤面已短角外、獲利浮空、漸萌補意、客胃乘此疲擋、亦相率問津、二盤以次、已轉穩定、迫下午開盤、以津帮粉銷漸化、而現麥腳地、亦呈舒展、散戶新興、　　活躍、購胃驟見濃厚、至收盤一路平坦、遂有寒谷春回之景矣、結果較上日收盤價、八九十月各好半分、十一月份大一分、十二月份大二厘半、一月份大七　半云、</p>
<h3>遠期麥新多又起　行販讓步中關貨成交一萬包</h3>
<p>昨日期麥上午開盤後、以洋麥報價、一致下降、現貨套賣仍力、近期猛落八九分、迨後粉市回升、空頭趁小抵補、午後市氣、逐趨穩健、而新多勃具、尤致力於遠期、故反動力較晨間跌勢為勁、而成遠漲近跌之局、惟一月份下午頭盤開拍後、二三四盤賣胃不機、故盤面不能益進、外表上反落於十二月份之後也、升降結果、八月份小六分、九月份小三分、十月十一月各好一分、十二月份好三分、一月份小五分、現麥中關貨充足、行販稍事讓步、昨日共成交一萬包、五河小麥五元〇五分、沙河集小麥五元〇三分、明光小麥五元〇一分、餘如臨淮關蘇州高郵蕪湖漢口等麥、自五元至四元八角半不等、至高貨則依然堅持、未有成交云、</p>
<h3>食米走銷仍屬呆滯　行盤亦見步跌</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到十四五號、貨共三千餘石、惟本街銷塲殊鮮、包胃靑島大連二帮亦祗辦薄蹈三四百包、及東新五十包、故市况難以支持、呈下垂之局、厚早粳價貶幾分至角許、薄稻竟跌一二角不等、杜洋尖帶疲、陰變元尙見站住、東新共到一千餘石、去路不旺、行情再落一尺、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來船十廿號左右、市上各貨銷路白粳殺價略交、羊秈變元高貨稍取、中次呆滯、東新粳平常、杜埠客尖亦淡、市形白粳高貨小近角、中次小角外、羊尖變元高貨平定中次小去幾分、杜埠客尖亦小角許、東新粳小一角、薄稻乏貨無市、顓橋新粳價小一二角、</p>
<h3>新黃荳市況俏俐</h3>
<p>新黃荳市況、自受日商在九江搜辦以來、一般人心恐來源受阻、致市氣非廠緊張、豆身高乾之貨、貨主有意居囤、故中次貨更覺上騰、昨開之價、雖與前市相彷、但在品質上足得二角、照其趨勢、似屬俏俐、昨做開九江各豆六千三四百包、常州牛皮黃千餘包、漢口早黃七百餘包、去路仍為榨油廠內地車坊及男洋本街等銷塲云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲價中外相差太遠</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲價、跌多漲少、紐約日絲有勻度者及廣東絲、昨各下跌三分、而上海絲七八勻度、昨竟下跌五分之譜、里昂日絲跌半法郞、上海絲AB兩等級各跌一法郞、廣東絲跌〇·七五法郞、紐約近遠期貨品、售開實價、較前日漲一分至一分半、橫濱漲五元至六元左右、國內行市與海外絲價相距又巨、如白廠B字二〇·二二條份、僅吃價六三〇元、與滬埠售盤、相差三四元又申埠白廠細條份（一一·一三）、如豐太持價為七六〇元、金豹為七八〇元、雙英為七八五元等、均乏成交、</p>
<h3>小針眉交易特旺　抽芯珍眉歐銷又動</h3>
<p>昨據茶業公會報吿云、綠茶市較上週略淸、惟小針眉交易數日來成交頗旺、昨協和續進五百餘箱、錦隆亦略跟辦、價與前相仿、珍眉交易仍屬零星、計協和辦四大名家茶百餘箱、價一百零四元、寳隆進徽珍一百餘箱、價五十五元及六十五元、及錦隆進抽珍百餘箱、價一百零六至一百十元、白頭行對八十元之貢熙仍續有成交、平水茶大帮走銷後、上週卽形淸淡、全週僅成交兩帮而巳、本週更無交易、為大帮開盤以來最靜寂之時期、昨報所載大帮交易暢達、全係傳聞失業、特此更正云、</p>
<p>另一訪稿云、路莊抽芯珍眉綠茶、前以摩洛哥發生戰事關係、人心轉變、去路久趨呆滯、近因歐洲銷路、據稱依舊暢通、而華商一再讓價求售、市盤較前减低二三十元、市面因之大為活動、昨日協和錦隆同孚永興等行、對於婺源屯溪等路高莊貨、均有鉅量進胃、價開一百零五元、此外針眉珠茶亦頗暢銷、身骨優良之蝦目蔴珠、更因貨缺提高二三元、綠茶市况、較前大為起色云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　瓜子金菜回漲甚勁　蜜棗到多價跌一元</h3>
<p>金針菜　近以號方堅守、市勢逐步轉佳、回漲甚勁、昨頂莊菜開至二十四元、以次為二十三元半至二十元半、普通略减、共成交一百數十包、比升一二元、行盤因亦呌升、如銷路旺動、或有續漲可能、</p>
<p>蜜棗　近日嘉興杭州蘇州蘭谿等均有到來、市勢略軟、比跌一元之譜、如杭嘉蘇及蘭谿等禿禿均售三十四元、較次之圓形蘭谿貨三十二元、上下　仍照向例加退、</p>
<p>黑瓜子　近以到貨稀少、兼之市存本缺、而產價叵升、故開價亦逐步向上、昨開三百數十件、計雙溝子十五元、高徐魁子十四元六角、次莊十三元六角、明光子十三元三角、</p>
<h3>糖市　五福白冰後批將到</h3>
<p>昨　巿趨勢依然平軟、公會　盤二四粗砂白現貨二十一元七角、轉口貨六元六角半、東白亦未轉定、四號白呌原價、八號YT嘜二十一元一角三分、續有成交、轉口貨六元一角、九號YR　嘜現貨二十元九角、轉口貨五元九角、均小一角、振記金心大華等一號白二十元半、餘照退、號貨靑赤白均呌原價、未肯過鬆、致乏續開、標準五福白冰久泛續釗、昨據號方電訊、後批已有裝出在途、價看平定、昨太原輪由厦台到有赤糖八百六十二包、白糖十三包、（昨報載海南赤價為十三元五六角誤為十二元五六角、附此更正、）</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布銷路减色　廠盤亦形鬆軟</h3>
<p>昨棉布市情、承連日紗花疲勢、及布疋銷路淸减影響、紛紛告跌、本廠粗布十六磅十五磅跌每疋二分半至五分之譜、怡和廠輕重磅及本廠輕磅價仍如舊、本廠細布細斜亦跌每疋五分左右、東貨細布細斜市布八四布雖連日下降已多、但因月底將屆、續有低盤發現、較之前日又跌每疋二分半以至五分、印花整理貨價尙平定、色布色斜亦降每疋一角左右日商開掛靑島公大嶸雙龍珠細布、十三磅半雙龍珠粗布、及大康廠五福集祥細布、豐田廠喇叭市細布、監雙魚細斜各貨數額零星、共祗一百餘件、廠盤亦見鬆軟、華廠白貨開訊更形沉寂、惟秋令中外花色貨、整理貨因廠方產量不湧、市上需要仍佳、且係交解定貨居多、市勢乃得站　、昨北帮長江內地各路小額花色貨裝運、及常州無錫等地來貨尙不寂寞、</p>
<h3>五金　蛋廠帮暢辦　二百磅美馬口鐵</h3>
<p>二百磅花旗馬口鐵、為蛋廠帮之切需品、近因天氣轉凉、本埠各蛋廠家均巳敲蛋開焙、故對馬口鐵需用突旺、是以日來開出達四五百箱之多、行情因連日海外紛紛報漲、本埠市面因亦挺硬、如正號一號貨估四十五元、正號二號貨估四十四元、正號三號貨開四十二元五角、此外一種野雞貨亦可開至四十二元、聞外埠客帮、連日亦有來函問津、</p>
<h3>雜貨　紅白皮已有到滬</h3>
<p>海口紅皮因乏續釗、市上頗感缺貨、昨聞號方巳有十數件運到、以正在銷方需要甚亟、故號盤如沙紅皮及白水靑均一致呌漲、趨勢頗佳、　市價</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>有一個疑問，在我們許多靑年們的腦　　　都那樣底盤旋着。「戀愛是不是我們所需要的呢！」其實，如果有一個朋友，踏上了戀愛之途，假使他有支配環境的毅力，那他可算為上乘了：反是，結果却逃不出煩惱的圈圍。</p>
<p>愈安適愈求安適，於是懈怠就包圍了週遭；我們旅行在入生大道上，前面是一片荊棘，但人生為的是奮鬥，顧不得脚上的刺痛，努力前去。在這個當兒，道旁有一染美麗的花，開着笑靨，那你馬上就驚奇起來，「想不到弁沙漠般的大地裏，竟會有能安慰我苦悶的花兒！」於是由欣賞，而愛慕，而採折，這時不但忘去脚上的刺痛，而且也停頓了前進之路。可是花月枯萎的時候，那便是你痛苦倍增的時候，因為先得了安適的撫慰，無形造成懈怠的習性，那麼對於困難的前途，是沒有勇氣去奮鬥了，他反說社會上的一切，都是虛偽的，一個人生文有什麼價値呢？自然，他墮落了！</p>
<p>假使在苦悶的包圍中，能得到潤濕枯燥生活的解語花，稍稍更換了眼前的環境，自然精神是興奮了；在這興奮之下，再繼續去奔趕我的前程，唱起勝利的曲子來，那麼他的任何一切，都有偉大的功效了！</p>
<p>所以我的結論是：戀愛祗能作為刺激苦悶精神的一帖興奮劑，不能作為飢餓時一個果腹的麵包。否則，定會中毒而死！又何况當前正有許多事，需要我門靑年去做，那裏再有空閒來迷戀這粉紅色的憧憬呢！</p>
<h3>詩人胡石予夫婦之德惠</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>我師胡石予先生，家崑山之蓬　鎭，篤學儉行，海內景仰，與金山高吹萬，常州錢名山，有江南三大儒之號，師母曹太夫人，赤以懿德聞鄕里，體無完衣，食不兼饌，而施人恐不周，鈸之西北二里，有鶴頸灣者，石梁毀於淸咸　間，架以木，亦朽且折，負薪擔蔬者，必繞道以過，三十年來無資以葺治，師母欲出私蓄以鳩工，未果而病逝，於是諸哲嗣相與啟笥檢遺金而泣，願建斯橋，以成母志，鄉氓頌其遺愛，名之曰胡夫人橋，耆宿金鶴望為之記，且鐫石焉。我師去歲患丹毒症，頭面驟腫，知覺全失，勢極危殆，經上海醫院陳肇昌醫師悉心調治，始慶更生，惟一足已廢，不良於行，置一竹輿，吟詠微吟，輒命傭僕舁之至槿籬卉圃問，觀賞為樂，有時扶龍頭拄，於斜陽影裏，督一二工人剔蟲芟草，老興婆娑，猶復不淺，時喜與友人及門弟子通札談詩文，以手震顫故，字體屈曲，彌饒古趣，滬上戈登路國華中學，以提倡國學，名傳遐邇，我師乃出一千元助之為獎學金，並請當代文學名家，如嚴獨鶴，周瘦鵑，高吹萬，葉楚傖，胡樸安，柳亞子，吳癯安諸子，擔任評閱課卷，諸子處由我師一一作書致意，予曾見其與吹萬書，略云：一違敎久，時時馳念，弟手顫，仍未復元，又左足濕氣，爛甚苦也，臥榻無聊，作詩贈先生賢喬梓各一首，俟秋凉，書入畫幅，再寄，詩先錄下呈政：『相違二百里，不見動經年，溪屋病夫老，山莊吟客仙，君詩爐火候，我畫雪霜天，盼斷片鳴羽，明湖棹綺船，緗素傳家學，少年今幾人，出門讓諸第，執業待嚴親，江海酬賓友，文章掃俗塵，長天秋一碧，翹首海東濱，』又上海國華中學，弟略助獎學金，尙有求公評閱課卷事，由國華校長王玉章君加入一書設明之，萬望不却，是幸，」蓋予近來掌敎國華校，故知之較詳也。</p>
<h3>外白渡橋</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>外白渡橋，、在上海，眞也可算是公共租界中的大去處之一。凡是從內地上上海來觀光的人們，玩過大世界，逛過城隍廟，登臨過國際飯店的屋頂，憑弔過閘北一帶的戰跡的，不可少的，縂也得來鑒賞一下子外　白渡橋外白渡橋，一名外擺渡橋，是面臨黃浦，下跨蘇州河的一條又長又寬的大鐵橋。若是從浦面上，或是蘇州河中，遠望着，眞有「長橋臥波」之狀。這條臥波的長橋，究竟有多少重，究竟可載重若干，恕我無由報吿。不過自從該橋誕生以來，每天總有數不情的車輪，數不情的人足，在上面由南往北，由北往南的輾過，中踏過，到現在，還是動都不動的靜靜地躺着，不舍畫夜的溝通着　南北的交通，其耐力的偉大，就可從這上面瞧出來。</p>
<p>據熟諳上海　掌故的人們域，上海初闢租界時，外白大渡橋的願意址非但沒有大鐵橋，就是獨木橋，也沒有一架的。在那時候，所有的南北交通工具，僅是幾葉方頭木質的小渡船而已。所以那時，該地名曰「擺渡口」。後來租界當局，籌資起建了這大鐵橋，一般人，便名之曰「擺渡橋」。初建時，車輛行人，通過該橋進，須納「過橋費」。後來取消此例，於是上海人，便呼之為「白渡橋」。意思是可以不用花過橋費，而可白白地渡過去。嗣後，乍浦路橋，也架起來了於是大家呼乍浦路橋，，為裏白渡橋，而把鐵鑄的白渡橋，尊為「外白渡橋」了。</p>
<p>外白渡橋，一端連着上海的熱鬧中心，——外灘，一端貫通着廣大的虹口區域，不啻是一個大咽喉。在該橋的二堍，林立着各國的領事館，而更是中外聞名的，是一個昔日「不許狗與華人入內」，現已公開了的外灘公園，恰在該橋的」南堍，沒冬沒夏，沒畫沒夜的吸引着上海市內的中外高等士女，因此，外白渡橋，在一般人的印象中，是更深刻着一層了。</p>
<p>若說津浦鐵路，是我國南北交通的骨幹，促進着文化，金融，軍事，實業等各方面的發展的，那麼我覺得，外白渡橋的對於上海，所負的使命，正相彷彿。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第五回　　喜字重來書題翠葉　嫁衣驚乍試淚濕絞綃</p>
<p>江太太笑道：做好了，也不用你現時就穿了出去，無非是讓你試試。夢蘭道：我現在不穿，我試試榦什麼？江太太對自巳女兒看看，又對床上的包袱看看，心裏就想着，這孩子豈不是存心。憑他那分聰明，什麽事不知道？因道：這也不是我的意思，你父親說，有了這衣料，不能閑放在家裏，就做起來罷。做起來之後，又不能立刻一試罷。試了再收起來，也好放心。因為要做得不合身的話，也好讓裁縫拿了去改做。你現在試一試。他說着，可提了衣服，只管向梦蘭身邊走了來。那兩只手提了衣服，老是縣着，不放下來，兩眼望了夢蘭，不住的微笑。夢蘭看到母親站在面前，作個女僕伺候小姐的樣子。若是儘管不理，未免瞧不起上人。便皺了眉道：媽何必這樣的性急，交給我穿就是了。於是接過衣服來，伸手就向袖子裏揷了進去。江太太扯住他的手道：那裏有這樣穿衣服你也要把身上的衣服脫了，才可以穿這個。夢蘭將新衣服提在手上呆了一呆，便點頭道：我全依了你就是了。於是走到帳子裏去，把上身夾襖換了，掀開帳子皺了眉峰笑道：你看這像一個鄕卞人嗎？江太太對他週身上下打量了一番，點點頭道：很合身材的。你素性把裙子繫起來看看。夢蘭道：裙子還有什麼不合式的嗎？不必試了。江太太却不再說什麼，又自己向前，把疊的裙子抖開，兩手操了裙腰。　着身子，就向夢蘭身邊來繫。夢蘭將身子一閃，笑道：我也不是三歲兩歲的小姑娘。你這樣的伺候着，不是折煞我嗎？江太太道：那你就自己繫上。說時，兩手捧了裙腰，依然送到而前來。夢蘭先是深深的歎了一口氣，接着又微笑起來。然後把裙子接過，自彎腰向身上繫了。笑道：我百依百順，依了媽的心了，還要作什麼呢。江太太笑道：你這孩子說話，為什麼總帶生氣的樣子。夢蘭也不說話，在堅子中間，緩緩的走了兩個來回，然後望了江太太道：媽看足了嗎？我可以脫下來了。江太太倒退兩步，坐在椅子上，對他望了很久。（六六）</p>
<h3>江灣書所見</h3>
<p>— （錢小山）</p>
<p>赤日下平地，霞光千丈鋪。老婦田中歸，龍鍾還荷鋤。問彼年幾何，八十頗有餘。年老盍少休，為腹家無儲。玄髮尙未白，自長久，此理　非虛。</p>
<h3>記口鼻絕技</h3>
<p>— 靑</p>
<p>前幾年，我曾在朋友婚筵的堂會中　見一位藝人表演他的絕技，使我佩服得了不得。他所表演的，並不是甚麼專靠傢伙靈巧的大套魔術，而全是那種玲瓏活潑的小玩意。然而雖說是小玩意，却都仗着他的眞本領眞功夫，一些兒沒有假借的。他的一張嘴，一個鼻子，都能帮着他做戲，做出種種式式的花樣來。最有趣的，他將一張白紙，摺成一個尖頭坦口的漏斗樣子，把來立在鼻尖上，仰着頭，打了幾個旋子，一面擦了一技火柴，在漏斗的口上燒將起來，不多一會，火已熊熊的燒去了半個漏斗，而下半截仍還立在鼻子上，一動都不動，後來完全燒成了灰燼，方始結束了這個把戲。當下他又把四根木杖撑住了一張小小的方桌，四根杖脚幷在一起，抬起頭來將嘴銜住了。這樣不算，更點明了四盞小檯燈，放在桌子上，中間更放着一架留聲機，西樂的唱片悠悠揚揚地放出聲來。我在一旁瞧着，禁不住替他揑了一把汗，想他這嘴上所担負的重量，至少總有好幾十斤吧？萬一倒了來，這禍可就闖得大了。誰知他却毫不在意，手中又提起一掛月琴來，輕　漫撚的撥動琴絲，奏出一支檀香山的月夜曲，恰和留聲機片中的西曲互相憲和，十分動聽。不道這鬼精靈還要賣弄他的本領，嘴上旣担着這樣的重任，嘴裏偏還要鳴嗚地作聲，給那曲兒做着節拍，這一下子眞使人佩服極了，鼓掌之聲，震動了屋瓦。一曲旣罷，他就放下了月琴，又親自把桌面上的小檯燈留聲機一件件的拿了下來，然後卸去四根木杖，雙手按住桌子，鞠躬而退。我瞧這們藝人的表演全在重心上用功夫，簡直是很明白物理學中重心的理論的，稱他是物理學家的藝人，亦無不可。我佩服之餘，上去請敎他的尊姓大名，他給了我一張名片，赫然是錢炳章三字。</p>
<p>這幾年奔走衣食，無心娛樂，已好幾年沒瞧見錢炳章的絕技了。昨天讀到申報本埠增刊中先施樂圖的廣告，　知道他正在樂　表演。士別三日，便當刮目相看，何況一別幾年呢？我想他的口鼻功夫，定有驚人的進步，而更能多翻出些新花樣來吧。</p>
<p>短訊　名畫家陶冷月氏，初夏展畫吳門，三吳人士，無不爭先快覩。惟陶氏少畫扇面。故喜收藏便面者。均以未得陶氏畫扇為憾。茲滬地友人。請其畫山水花卉扇面各一百葉，半價取潤，花卉每面六元，（原潤十二元山水每面十二元，（原潤二十四元）。現定去者巳將百件。為便利選購者起見，特託河南路榮寳齋經理陳列，本埠可親往選購，外埠則可滙寄潤金至貝勒路同益里四號冷月畫室。卽可得陶氏畫扇。（扇面奉贈）惟額滿仍照原潤云。</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>關於防空的常識</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>防空的認識已成了非常時期國民所必需要的常識。故各國都時常練習防空演習，除了考查防空計劃的成效之外，便是實地訓練國民對付敵機來襲的方法。七月二十日日本東京橫濱川崎三市連合作大規模的防空演習，費時四日。人民很能表示其空防常識並不缺乏。回顧我國，則連燈火管制還沒有試騐過的地方也很多呢。</p>
<p>空軍總是利用夜間襲擊為多，最有效的當然是防空，飛行隊在半途上撲滅之。因此飛機塲的建築，是很為重要了。大都會裏分配了一一」百鬥高射砲，和妨碍敵機的探照燈，但是總不免可以强行通過的。譬如高射砲十六門的正面，來了四十架飛機，大的有八架是可以强被侵入的。一架飛機可以載燃燒彈千顆，那末都巿裏的救火車，將如何應付？燃燒彈的熱度約三千度，鋼鐵都可熔解的。一瓦的炸彈，直徑五六寸。最大的二十瓦，最小的只有二百瓦，　蘇俄發表，飛機十架，可戰燃燒彈五萬。結果九千處發火，其他是落在不發火的地方，如道路公園江河中。如此五卞平方粁內有五萬發，平均一百米平方中，卽命中一彈了。</p>
<p>照歐洲大戰的例，倫敦是用飛機防空的，巴黎則以高射砲保護。結果倫教擊落了較多的敵機，巴黎却滅少了　街的損害。英國受飛機襲擊六十三次，飛船的襲擊五十三次死傷四卞八百二十一名。巴黎計四　六次只死傷了九百人左右。因為英國對齊泊林的進攻，連防　的方法都沒有了。</p>
<p>毒瓦斯也是擊滅都市的利器，民衆所用的防毒面具。在　本只有六塊錢一具，最好的的　，都有陸軍的印鑑。而陸軍用的，是由化學研究所製造的。防毒面具裏的主要藥劑是活性炭，用氈毛包裹着。應急的時候用木炭屑和棉花，放在沒有底的啤酒瓶裏也可以的。他的效力只能保持數分鐘至　數分鐘，不能稱為完全有效的。最安全還是將房屋閉塞。改造成為防毒的往所。防毒面具不過是出外時暫時應用罷了。</p>
<p>五六層的木造房屋　是不難為炸彈破壞的。大的三層鋼骨混凝土的房屋，在地下室　可安全。從前蘇滬　帶　掘的地害，在木造兩層房屋之　，恐怕沒有多大效力。倘若不闢地道，達於　外，是反而危險的。我國普通房屋，都談不　防炸，只有造幾十處公共用的防禦地室之外，未必有急救的方法吧。</p>

<h3>縱慾損害「健康」及「壽命」的程度</h3>
<p>— 王士英醫師</p>
<p>一般人認為夫婦的結合，就是為了生殖，但是除此之外，尙有三大效能，在個人方面，第一可滿足個人的性要求，第二可得一種人格的調劑，第三可使種族之命運永久，綜上所論，可證明婚姻影響於個人及社會的關係甚大，吾見時下的靑年，對夫婦的結合，每都不能澈底瞭解，不能以適宜調節的生活去實現這三大效能，未婚之前，濫行手淫，新婚之後，從慾無度，故對於性的要求已經超格過量，因精力的消費過大，致精神衰頹，肌肉瘦削，甚至因此喪失了生殖腺的壯健，全身各部大受妨碍，康健失去保障，蓋此時人體的血液製造，雖為普通狀態，但縱慾漫無節制，因精血消費量過度，赤血球减少，血色素减少，新陳代謝的促進能力，大受威脅，此不過較决而已，尙有最重大的關係，厥為生殖腺素——內分泌的缺少，因為性慾是山分泌腺所生的內分泌刺戟及由腺液積蓄所生之反射的感情而發。故如縱慾過度，則生殖腺所產生的分泌消耗逾量，肉體與精神大受壓迫，必致健康失常，壽命促短。</p>
<p>患者馮明德，年廿三歲，浙之寗波人，彼於十七歲時卽開始性生活，隨心縱恣，漫無節制，六年內縱慾之結果，精方大損，面容憔悴，頭髮稀脫，遺精，滑精早洩，陰萎，百病叢生，實因生殖腺摧毀劇烈，生理上所產的新血液，遂被消耗殆盡”今年春被同病者介紹餌服純良生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』，立呈精神充足，體態壯健之象，連服四盒，早洩，陰萎完全治好，同時因服『希米脫氏固精片』遺精亦得治愈矣。</p>
<h3>最有把握的　淋病自療良法</h3>
<p>— 香港醫科大學醫學學士吳大超</p>
<p>淋病為花柳病中最頑固難治的傳染病，任何人都不能否認。所以雖有千百種的治淋藥問世，依然不能將淋病掃除盡絕。不過其中也有因自己錯過了治療的時機，變成惡化。也有的因攝養不常，形成纏綿不治之狀。除此以外，則為誤於醫藥的居多了。因為淋病如在急性期內能够循芷當的途徑治療，不延誤時日，即以黃色素和伐克辛製成的『安敵淋』治之，就能很快治好，因為『敵淋』含有抵抗淋菌的菌苗甚多，黃色素有透膜殺菌的能力甚偉，所以能將叢集在泌尿器生殖器及各部的淋病雙球菌，一網打盡，絕其併發病的危險。要明瞭急性期內的治療，是醫藥界一致公認為治本的絕好機會，不過這機會稍縱即逝，錯過了就要變成慢性，並且也有變成為睪丸炎，膀胱炎，關節炎等等的危險。</p>
<p>患者何可人，年廿八歲，彼所患者為慢性淋病，據云已有兩載，小便頻數，前後渾濁不甚顯明，蓋何君已患後部尿道炎矣。上月中旬由朋友介紹服以『安敵淋』之後，淋病症狀，遂漸轉佳，的服五盒之後，濁止尿澄，前日來余處檢騐，蓋已完全斷根，余乃詢以用何藥冶愈，彼始為我詳述如上。</p>
<p>夫婦智識</p>
<p>— 美國本薛　文尼大學醫學博士姚爾昌</p>
<h3>不姙的原因與性障碍的療法</h3>
<p>……請注意身體及各部重要器官病態的補救法　……如何能使性能增强以增加夫婦前途的幸福　……闡明生殖腺的衰頹與本症及人體發育關係</p>
<p>一個條分縷析有關夫婦生活的生理學底知識介紹，在道裏因為限於篇幅及他種關係，恕不能詳細地貢獻給讀者了。把有較為重要的關於夫婦相自己所必需的姙娠學識及性機能障碍症的補救法，可以摘要的叙述一點，可許多讀者，縱然見了這些世合需要的知識，也會驚為奇蹟的，但是我們要使每個的夫婦所有的缺憾，都能夠藉文字的指導，得到合理的解決，一切常人所認為不能治療的疾病，都要由我們的討論使之受範，所以我們要加速的盼望，科學家和醫學家們，要在我們的論題裏，多佔園地。</p>
<p>為了整個的夫婦福利，我們希望將來的青年，在未結婚之前，必須要將他們身體與各部重要器官特別注意，務使強壯健全，有沒有隱病？更要知道如何生育兒童，產生強健的子女，在男子方面必須要發育健全，體力與肌肉強壯結實，然後才有優秀的精子射出。所以有手淫遺精的靑年，及罹患花柳病及發育不全的，其决因早婚或婚後房事過度而衰弱者及素有早洩，陰萎，神經衰弱的男子及月經不調，乳癟體弱，缺少姙娠機能的女子，必須要從實際上求治療的方法，依其體質病源講求適當的治療，如因身體衰弱，發育不全或因婚後房事過度致罹有性機能障碍症者，其補救的着重點應注意其生殖腺，切不可使其衰頹，因衰頹之故，纔有此種病態，故應以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』服之，女子可服女用『生殖素』，即能恢復其發育，膨脹其乳房，最顯著者為月經的調整。則子宮的障碍盡除，姙娠的能力增强，姙娠絕無問題。除此之外，有因遺精過久，致精關鬆懈，精液稀薄，則兼以鞏固精關的『希米脫氏固精片』服之，或因淋病之故，致早洩，陰萎，則『生殖素』誠為對症的良藥，但同時應以黃色素和伐克辛製劑的治淋效藥『安敵淋』治其淋病，因『安敵淋』含有抵抗毒菌的能力甚强，且具有透膜殺菌的偉大王道藥力，可達到澈底根治的目的。如是，兩性問方可同樣享受其夫婦的眞正濃厚樂趣也。</p>
<p>性病講座</p>
<p>— 姚爾昌博士詹念曾醫師合編</p>
<p>（診所）四川路北京路轉角中國信託公司二樓　（門診）上午十時至下午六時。星期日休息。</p>
<p>（一）發育不全及夢遺</p>
<p>患者張庭輝，浙江嘉興人，年二十四歲，（主訴——由十五歲起即犯手淫惡癖，到今尙不能完全戒絕，故剛在發育時即受摧殘，至今陰莖及睪丸極小，而且每兩日內必有夢遺，頭腦易疲勞，記憶力不良。（現在症狀）——陰華，畢丸，攝護腺等皆發育不良，反射機能亢進，併發神經衰弱症狀。（治療方法）——『育維賜保命』注射，攝獲腺按摩，施以感電氣治療，並以生殖腺素製劑服之，使其發育滿意，同時以鞏固精關有效名藥『希米晚氏固精片』治其遺精，的二個月左右，神經衰弱症及遺精等盡愈，精神漸决爽快，肌肉亦特別發胖，同時胃口轉佳，體重增加，完全與治療前判若霄壤矣</p>
<p>（二）包莖早洩之治療</p>
<p>患者曾學銘，江蘇溧陽縣人，經營百貨生意，今年廿四歲。（主訴）——因早婚之故，發育大受障碍，且包皮過長，雖用手指使包皮翻退時，　頭亦不能露出，包皮前端僅有一小孔，排尿時，尿先注於包皮間，而後再由包皮間排出。射精時亦然，故感極度不快，勃起頻繫，十八歲結婚後，因性慾過度，不到一年，竟罹早洩之症，不能營完全性生活，近且有夢遺，如工作緊張時，竟能在大庭廣衆間將遺液滑出，白日亦感覺心悸，盜汗，夜間則失眠，頭痛，稍一操勞，即覺四肢無力，精神萎頓，憂鬱萬狀，（現在症狀）——血壓下降，反射機能亢進，攝護腺萎縮不能觸知，包莖，並有高度神經衰弱症，胃弛緩症，精系努脹，體重祇有八十八磅，畏寒，怕煩，（治療方法）——先施以局部麻醉，將包皮先端收縮輪部分割去少許，成環狀。縫合，冷却，電氣治療，以『生殖素』增强其發育，補充其精血，同時再以『希米睨氏固精片』鞏固其精關，治愈其遺精，治療約二星期，身體逐漸强壯，遺精完全停止，精神淸爽，性能增强，祇有四旬，諸病盡失，體重竟達一百〇一磅。</p>

<h3>手淫的弊害及遺精的根治</h3>
<p>— 詹念曾醫師</p>
<p>器械的末梢性　戟法奧精神性手淫　夢遺及滑精對神經中樞侵害的程度</p>
<p>手淫行為，在靑年中不分男女，是極其普通容易精患的一種惡　。但是它　　的結果，因了各人的年齡，體質，行為的程度而有顯著的差別。大凡一個靑年因手淫蒙了惡劣影響之後，那就有矯正其惡癖和在早期施以完全治療的必要了。</p>
<p>手淫行為的影響，一般人所公認者為：高度神經衰弱症，體質虛弱，胃腸障碍，生殖器發育不良等；此外病症的最顯明象徵者；為遺精頻繁，此幾為手淫癖者必有之症候，故遺精之人，神經袞弱症定難避免的。</p>
<p>手淫方法，因男女及僩人而有不同，但大體上分做兩種：一種是刺戰局部的方法，另一種是努力做精神上的冥想，以達一定高潮的方法。前者也可以呌做器機的末稍性刺　法，後者也可以呌　精神性手淫，其弊　無所軒鞋。</p>
<p>手淫後，最顯見的症候，厥為遺精的頻繁，這在　　已經說過了？例如有一患者沈一如為一初中學生，年十七歲，因染手淫惡癖，爆發遺精及健忘，頭痛，心悸，耳鳴等症，今年五月間由彼戚夏秋聲君介紹服以『希米脫氏固精片』後，精關治固，遺精乃得不發，起先為試服性質，因服一盒後，即覺夢幻减少，遺精吿止，乃連服三盒，迄今已歷三月，從未遺精云。觀此，則知治療的方法，必須着重治本，所以應鞏固精關，精關旣固，精液即不致遺流，神志堅定，夢幻及冥想杜絕，故『希米脫氏固精片』確為遺精患者無上對症的良藥，沈君因遺精後感覺患有神經衰弱症，故同時並以『生殖素』服之。服後頓覺神志淸爽。體健倍增，為從來所未有云。</p>
<p>骨痛常識</p>
<h3>骨痛與腎虧及血份的關係</h3>
<p>— 周笑涵醫師</p>
<p>促成骨痛的主要原因，散載於各醫刊及雜誌，討論的垓心，大都為瘋濕內蘊，血份不潔，及衰老抵抗力薄弱等。誠然，此確為促成骨痛的重要原因，然尿酸過多，及因縱慾過度，使腎經虧損，則骨痛症無可避免。此外動脈硬化，亦必由骨痛而變為中風猝倒半身不遂等症。故凡罹有骨痛症者，必須擇具有治療上述各症的藥力，要有舒暢筋絡，澄淸血液，袪瘋散寒，止痛消腫的功能，並須有輔助全身抵抗的能力，始克滅事，例如最近有一患者鄭君，彼年三十八歲，因在早年涉足花叢，且因職業關係，僕僕長途，盡風受寒，療濕內蘊，近三年來，時覺腰背酸楚，雖曾服藥調治，因藥不對症，鮮少效東，上年冬，病轉惡化，甚至痛時手足拘孿，筋絡牽痛，四肢麻木，病重時陷於不能動彈，與半身不遂無異，旋由同病者的介紹服以『强斯登氏骨痛片』之後，病勢轉機，痛楚减輕，先時祇感覺筋絡舒暢，骨節輕鬆，嗣後行動如常，雖工作稍久之後，亦不感覺腰背酸痛矣，鄭君本余舊友，深恐日後復發，乃來余處詢問所服之藥是否對症，余夙知『强斯登氏骨痛片』治骨痛最具卓效，賞用已久，迭用以治療本症，從未有復發者，故當担保其藥力之王道，功效之偉大，鄭君始安心稱謝而去。</p>
<h3>戒煙成功的新紀錄</h3>
<p>— 賈治中醫師</p>
<p>戒煙的方法，雖有不少。但必須擇人而施，且亦必經過一定的時期，嘗到種種的痛苦，如尚藥力不當，依然會半途失敗，故癮君子對於戒煙目為最痛苦的工作，所以情願受盡磨折，刺激，傾家蕩產來滿足其烟量，他也曉得吸煙是墮落的，沒有幸福的，實在因為麻醉力的控制，祇得無可如何，現在醫學進步，對於戒煙的方法，日新月異，觀乎下列的一如戒煙經過，就可以知道困難的問題，已被事實擊得粉碎無餘了。</p>
<p>患者王名振夫婦，海州人，年的四十五六，因吸煙過久，面容枯黃，全無血色，除皮骨之外，全身毫無肌肉，且精神萎頹，衰弱不堪，故雖前後凡三次戒煙，均半途失敗，實因戒時病痛叢生，不克支持，祇得重復吸煙取緩，今春由彼戚之介紹，用培補戒烟法，服以生殖腺素製劑男用女用「生殖素」增加全身的抵抗力，一方面减少烟量，一方面產生一種新的精力來消滅因戒烟而起的種種痛苦，所以彼夫婦戒時，全不感覺絲毫不適，同時食量增進，面色紅潤，精神旺壯，體重亦逐漸增加，祇有五星期之時期，竟將多年之煙癮完全斷根，刻已戒除六閱月矣，不知者，眞不知彼夫婦昔為一對黑籍的沉淪者云。</p>
<p>乳癟療法</p>
<p>編輯先生，余因體格素弱，發育不全，乳房平坦如男子今年十一月間，行將出閣，且未婚夫為一酷愛摩登的新典型靑年，余亦受初中敎育，自知種種的缺點所在，為謀自身的康健計及婚後的幸福計，亟思謀一治療之法，故於今年五月間，服以貴刋所指導的女用一生殖素一之後，果然重復發育，精神旺盛，乳房與腎部膨脹豐腴，與前刊若兩人矣。誠覺幸運，感激貴刋指導之情，無時或忘，專此謝謝、（陳美行）</p>
<p>胃痛胃呆</p>
<p>先生余因操勞過度，胃臟不健，時覺疼痛，消化不良，精神亦日漸萎頓矣，請賜告應服何藥，可以根治，不勝幸甚。（沈子鴻）</p>
<p>（答）可向五洲藥房購「胃痛靈」及「健胃素」服之卽可。</p>
<p>白帶暗疾</p>
<p>余素有白帶之疾，近日流量激增，身體亦感疲乏，請問應以何法治之，即可止帶健身，</p>

<h3>「求取眞正自由」之途</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>二十一日的各報載有華聯社二十日的天津電，說是：「冀東僞區石河，頃發現反殷人民自衛軍，約千餘人，均便衣，持有步槍及盒子槍，現已分隊至撫寗，灤縣，遵化，玉田等地，向民間宣傳驅殷，並聯絡民團，自出槍械壯丁，擴展實力，武裝打倒殷逆，求取眞正自由，各地民眾，團丁，多為感動，連日自動參加者甚眾，聲勢日趨浩大，殷逆已電所屬特種警隊，嚴密搜殺，同時，殷逆察悟張慶雲，張硯田舊部警士有不穩反正現象，擬本月內加以改編。</p>
<p>這條新聞很簡單，但却帶來了很大的興奮；別的人讀這條電訊時作怎樣感想我不知道，至於我却是受了很大的激動的。</p>
<p>「親善」，「提携」，「調整」的聲浪在我們的「耳」旁響着，而武力，經濟，文化……種種軟硬兼施的侵略行為，也同時在我們的「目」前，我們不「以耳代目」，我們以「聽其言而觀其行」的結果，當然不會把砒霜認為蜜糖，雖然敵人一手以「糖衣毒藥」授給我們的時候，另外一隻手正在拿着一把雪亮的尖刀，預備拒絕了他的要求時候使用，但是，這樣難道就嚇得倒我們嗎？</p>
<p>幾年來的事實也明明白白的答覆了這點，在「王道」與「格殺」的所謂「恩威並施」下，黑山白水間不是就正活躍着不願做奴隸的義勇軍？而且，幾年來在艱苦困難的處境中，單憑他們的熱血和土槍，不已經使「傀儡」和「友軍」調遣奔波，徨徨不可終日了嗎？</p>
<p>難道，以一些恐嚇，就能使我們低頭？就能使我們乖乖地把毒藥吞下去，在敵人的歡笑中滅亡，毫無抵抗的滅亡！</p>
<p>這樣，為了生存，僞區民眾的組織人民自衛軍，以「武裝」來爭取「眞正自由」，以及「連日自動參加者甚眾」，原也不值得驚奇了。而也就於這一點上，我們可以證實，僞區民眾是在過着怎樣的生活。</p>
<p>以「武裝」來「求取眞正自由」，我以為這條路綫是對的，也惟有這條路，纔能「求取眞正自由」，不然，「你講理而對方却用武力來解決，試問「秀才遇着兵」有理如何講得清？不過以「武裝」來「求取眞正自由」，有兩咪則非注意不可的，那便是不要忘記自己是民眾，這次的鬥爭是為我們自己，不是「取而代之」的「勝則為王」的「王」；第二，則是應該明白勝利的基礎是建在團結一致的上，如想爭功勞或是做英雄，那便會給敵人各個擊破，並且，如果團結得不堅固，或是僅僅祇有少數人的團結，那還是要失敗的。——自然，在同仞敵愾之下，我這樣說是有些近乎杞人之憂。也願意這是杞人之憂。</p>
<h3>夜泊香江</h3>
<p>— 夏理斯</p>
<p>這眞是感傷的行旅啊。</p>
<p>船進港海口的時候，已經是薄暮了，灰色的天，綠油油的海，還有沙沙的濤聲，激動着旅人底感情。我和叔秋——一個和靄，寬大的旅伴，一同站在甲板上，憑着欄干望着兩岸的青山。讓離愁與別恨在心不裏邊不斷地滋長，而我們是沉默的。天色越加深沉，海嘯越加清晰；猛地鳴鳴呌了起來的船笛，摧醒了我們底夢一般的沉迷。</p>
<p>「快到香港了」。叔秋說。</p>
<p>「而我們，是就要分手了。」我說。</p>
<p>「人生沒有不分離的筵席」，叔秋顯然是很有依依不捨的情緒的，不過他盡力地忍住了。「就是一羣山羊，也有失散的時候……」</p>
<p>「我們不能使山羊不失散；相好的友情不消失嗎？」</p>
<p>「分離並不是友情的消失；相反地，或許這正是增進友情的一種機會。」</p>
<p>「希望眞能這樣就好！」</p>
<p>這樣地談着，不覺地船已停泊於香港的海面了，靠的是九龍碼頭。甲板上頓時忙亂了起來：水手們奔來走去，旅館掮客在呌着旅邸的招牌；在這種譁然的情形之下，叔秋是預備好登岸的手續，把行李點給了旅館底人，而回轉來了。</p>
<p>我站立於甲板上，茫然地望着對岸的香港半島。那半山的點點的燈火，眞是多麼逗人的哪。對着這燈景而發楞的我，是在想着這些五顏六色的燈光的製造者——人類征服自然的一種壯觀而感歏。不是麼，人類底力量有什麼不可以征服呢？祇是我現在却為一種難以排解的離愁所縛，而被感情底手練所扣住。一背過臉，看見叔秋還正伴了我而站着，對了香港底燈景。</p>
<p>在那紅的，綠的燈下該是怎樣的世界呀！香港和我的陌生的：而和叔秋則相熟。叔秋要我陪伴他上岸去；船到天亮時才開，他會照顧我回來的。我應允了，我正想看香港到底是怎樣的面目……</p>
<p>小輪渡把我和叔秋帶上了香港底岸。</p>
<p>香港底海傍道上，靜寂而清潔，吹着七月末的南方底季候風。幾輛人力車湊過來，兜着生意。但是叔秋說：</p>
<p>「我們還是走走好」。</p>
<p>香港底路是不容易走的；尤其是走上斜坡去的時候，實在有點吃力。叔秋知道應該找個什麼地方歇歇了；這時候我們恰好有點肚餓，便一同進了一家酒家去了。</p>
<p>忘不了的是那清秀的，嬌憨的女招待；我雖然不知道她底名字，不知道她底一切，但在旅途中，她却溫暖了我底心。雙蒸酒一杯又一杯地喝下去了，天氣還熱，汗水就不住地淌了出來。她開了電扇；還不時送來香味的手巾。</p>
<p>「兩位先生上那里去的？省城嗎？」她用一種溫和的，宛囀的廣州話問着。</p>
<p>「我就在這里敎書。」叔秋這樣回答她，又指着這我說：「他却如你所說的那樣，到省城去的。」</p>
<p>「省城現在正是最熱鬧的時候——她站在我底身旁，睜開眼睛，好像看見了她所熟悉的地方一樣，「荔枝變划着小舢板，對着夏夜底星星，你會感到一種難以言說的愉快。也許長堤的散步，會使你覺得世界並不如一般憂世者所說的那麼灰暗……」</p>
<p>「香港呢？為什麼不留戀香港？」我說了。</p>
<p>「因為荔枝灣頭有過我青春戀情的滋長……而現在，先生，生活底惡手扼住了我底喉管！」</p>
<p>在這善以言辭的女招待底面前，我們消磨了一個多鐘頭。走的時候我還投之以眷棧的一眼，而她可嫵媚地笑了。</p>
<p>香港啊，我為什麼要離開你呢？</p>
<p>這一夜的兩點鐘，我還不能入寐，又從艙里摸索而上，到甲板上來對這明媚的島嶼告別。燈火暗下去了，只留下疎疎的幾，閃灼着，微笑着，這時不知道叔秋已經睡着了沒有？而想起了那清秀的女招待，上帝，我在深深地替她祝福啊！</p>
<h3>海與老人</h3>
<p>— 蘿澎</p>
<p>一個明朗的下午，我一個人搬到這海邊來孤獨地居下了，我愛海：海給我的印象太深了，它能使我神經，更能使我憂鬱。</p>
<p>每天當陽光在海的盡頭！將垂到西方地平綫下去的時候，我坐我簡陋的</p>

<p>木屋中，老是從那四方口徑的小窗中呆呆地望出去，看海這時穿上美麗的晚裝了：三五隻小鳥，從從容容地在海面上盤旋着，彷佛流浪人在找尋着歸處，海天的盡頭，昌起淡紫色的烟霞。漁人駕着小帆，霧散地順着微風，在向晚的放光的海面上駛來，船頭冲開了平靜的海面，輕　得猶如一隻涼水的小燕兒。一會兒，夜幕就要掩蓋着我的窗戶了。</p>
<p>也許是黃昏的景色太美了，我坐在小窗中還不能瀰滿了我監償的慾望。也許是屋外另有一種東西，更能使我注意吧？乘着陽光未沒之際，我便跑到海灘上去散步了。</p>
<p>在海邊，，我看見了一個老人，其先他不能引起我的注意，漸漸地他的孤獨的影子與黃昏的海同佔有着我的腦際了。他是那樣地衰弱：每天，每天，他拖着緩慢步子，彎曲着腰，用手杖軟弱地敲着沙地，一顚一顚地走到海灘上來了，在一塊滾圓的靑石上面他坐下來。手甘有他的步子的足跡，印在海灘上，拖着一條長長的尾巴，一直延到望不見的海灘的遠處……。</p>
<p>他的過份的莊嚴驚住了我，使我不敢走近他的身邊，只在遼遠的地方呆望着他。老人是那樣安靜地眺望着海的遠處，彷彿前面有着一件不可解的秘密在</p>
<p>日子一久，這奇怪的老人在我的印像中，是比較熟識的了。我再不像以前那樣不敢走近他的身邊去了。我尋找他說話，我凝視着他，但是他不理會我，全然沒有感覺似的。</p>
<p>陽光僅在海天的盡頭閃着一天最後的光芒，黑暗的魔手將緊握着大地的時候，老人深陷的乾澀的眼眶中，照例便會滾動着晶瑩的淚珠了。有好幾决，我也會莫明其妙地被老人感得流下眼淚來。每天都是那樣，海邊寂靜得只聽得見波浪拍着沙灘的聲音，老人便依舊拖着緩慢的步子向原來的路上歸去了。</p>
<p>最後，我發誓，我要明瞭老人的底細了。於是，我緊尾隨在他的後面。</p>
<p>離開海邊大的有一百多步模樣的高坡上，有着老人的住處，——那是一間給風雨常年磨拆的破爛不堪的小屋。當老人未回到屋子之前，這屋子的門口，便有着一個三十餘歲的中年婦人呆呆地坐在那兒等着了，她的面前放着一隻飯籃</p>
<p>老人打開了門上的鎖，中年婦人將飯籃放在一張小桌上，便返身走出了屋子，一句話也不講，老人從來就沒有理會她。</p>
<p>一天，在老人未回到他的屋子之先，我問這中年婦人，探詢着老人的底細了：『請問，這老人是你的什麼人？』</p>
<p>『他是我的父親！』</p>
<p>『那麽你為什麽每天都不和他說話呢？』</p>
<p>『唉！他不喜歡我們女人，他歡喜兒子，他說女兒都是討債鬼！』</p>
<p>『那麼他有兒子麽？』</p>
<p>『他有兒子，他有兩個兒子，我的大哥在八年前他到海的那邊很遠很遠的地方去了，他說他去賺錢，他說他隔年（第二年）就會回來，可是，唉……』她用衣服角揩着眼淚：『一直到現在還沒有回來，有人說他出去當了兵在戰塲上打死了，還說他帶信回來，呌我們不要想他，可是這消息，父親還不知道！』</p>
<p>『那麽他的二兒子呢？』</p>
<p>『我的二弟嗎？』她抬起腦袋來，睜着一對悲凉的眼睛，望了我一眼：『唉，是前年，前年，他出去打魚，遇着了大風，給海浪捲去了，直到現在屍首還沒有尋着……』說着，他便凄凉的哭起來了。</p>
<p>遠處，海灘上老人的手杖，敲着沙灘的聲音，傳進了我們的耳股，一下一下地像敲在我們的心上。</p>
<h3>日光下（續）</h3>
<p>— 舒</p>
<p>陽下面，他們依　為自己底日子而亡命地奔走着：一要是　有一天會倒下了。那便好了」。</p>
<p>尋覓着，尋覓着，在　街上，在什麽地方有了一片空曠的塲地，卽使汗像泉水一樣地流出，也足以使他們　激而打轉，小孩子打起刺耳的鑼鼓，一套花槍，一套狗鐵圈，一套蓮花落……在大太陽下面，人是熱得要昏過去了。巡捕走來干涉的時候，也把第一次看客所擲下來的銅子送去做「香烟錢」了，餘下來的十幾個子，呌三口兒望着，怎麽得過呢？</p>
<p>中年的老關發了急，也忘記了暑天的如火的太陽了，像一條瘋狗那樣地，要着，要着，關心着地上的銅子，稀少得使人不敢看，不敢想的，那幾個銅子</p>
<p>「這一天的生活呢？生活呢」一想起這，心便冷下來了，可是他却依舊得賣力地要着，引人拍手，引人笑……</p>
<p>氣喘了，臉也變得慘白了、孩子瞧着駭怕，便輕輕地說：「爹，你住一會吧，讓我們來吧。」</p>
<p>「不，不！再一回，便有人擲銅子了，」</p>
<p>依舊像瘋狗一樣地要着，太陽如火一樣的晒炙，看的人也稀少了，可是錢呢？那些錢，收下來的已經孝敬了巡捕了，而這日子，這日子……</p>
<p>一陣頭暈，眼前發了黑，老關眞的不自主地昏倒了，路人沸騰起來，孩子空虛地哭起來了，人給了十滴水，也沒有用，說是中署已經深了，完了，……</p>
<p>完了，那終究是好的，這年頭，老關是的確已走到了路的盡頭，而如今，他終於倒下了，在生活前面，在日光下。</p>
<h3>蓮花燈</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>石老娘淋着一身冷汗的醒轉過來。他揉了揉昏花的眼睛，不信任地端詳着房裏的一切，那時候天雖然還沒有透亮，但一切在她看來都是那樣熟悉的，她才恍然地曉得剛才作的不過是一塲惡夢</p>
<p>她恍惚看見她的兒子穿着一件給血浸透了的短掛，跪在她的床前，用哀痛的聲音向她求着。</p>
<p>「娘，我現在苦死了啦！給我一些零用錢化吧。要是手頭寬裕，就請糊料匠給我糊一身衣裳，這血浸透的短衫褲見不得人啦！我在陰間慘够了，人家都虐待我，說我是一個窮鬼……」</p>
<p>石老娘認出這是她死去不久的兒子，剛想伸手去摸摸他，問他從那裏來的，忽的一聲，隔屋的鷄呌了，他就慌張地盤過窗跑出去。石老娘剛想牽住他，因為太過用力，就一挽不着他，自己反給摔倒了。</p>
<p>他沒有倒在地上，這是一個夢，她還是躺在床上的。現在她醒過來了。眼角還是潤濕濕的，他低聲地自語着說：</p>
<p>「怎麼啦，龍兒返魂來麼？咳，他眞的也是苦够了，自他死了之後，只給他焚了四百銀錠，這怎麼够他化呢？陰間無親無戚的。……」也許是因為七月十五快到了，兒子託託夢，要她給他唪唪經，讓他超昇吧。兒子天性本是好的，她心裏這樣想，可是跟了惡伴，做了命案，可就不得超昇了。</p>
<p>他立刻又想起一年前在左的事來。兒子本是在里門口擺賣點心的。那時候，她自己正生着惡病，又乏錢請大夫，這一來可把他急煞了。就在那一天，她還紀得淸楚，是陰曆六月十三，天還沒有亮，他就起床，西色白里泛靑，慌張地跑到床前吿訴她說︰</p>
<p>「娘，我要上城里去一趟，淸早就回來，也許可以請城里的大夫下鄉來</p>

<p>電影</p>
<h3>（小姊妹）雜寫</h3>
<p>「小姊妹」是叙述有一少女名林曼麗者為後母李氏及姊曼娜同住，後母待之甚苛，虐罵欺侮無所不至，且事事又皆偏其親生女曼娜，故曼娜益驕縱懍人，視乃姊曼麗如眼中釘，驅使又如婢僕，曼麗處在如此情景之下，簡直就同牛馬，日惟以淚洗面，然又缺乏反抗能力，故徒喚奈何而已。其遭遇的可憐，處　的　　，足使觀者為之一洒同情之淚，而世間所謂「秋天的日頭，晚娘的拳頭」一句俗語，在此是益證明確不是虛有之談了。</p>
<p>小烏兒袁美雲卽是飾了上述的溫柔的曼麗，及嬌縱的曼娜的兩個角色。有一天，是在拍曼娜摑曼麗耳光的幾個鏡頭，黃嘉謨在旁看得好笑起來，便對袁美雲說：「袁小姐，你還不是自己在打着自己的嘴巴嗎」？這雖然是笑　，可是其話中所包含的意義確就極深，而袁美雲到底是怎樣摑着自己耳光，這巧奪天工的攝影術，的確是大有可覜了。</p>
<p>徐琴芳這次東山再起，客串了個後母的角色，她對曼娜是放縱的溺愛的，但對曼麗却是嚴厲的，刻薄的，所以在此劇中，她是不時使用着兩副的絕端反對的不同面孔出現着，卽是一個兇狠至極的標準晚娘了。而她的演出「確就」甚佳，緊緊地把着劇中人的身份，足使觀眾一種抱不平的反抗情緒三天之後猶無能消滅。</p>
<p>總括地說，「小姊妹」是一部家庭的悲劇不過在另一方面所摻入的諷刺笑　，又是極為豐富，所以它雖能使人哭得傷心，但也會使人發笑，笑得肚子疼，眼淚流。</p>

<h3>（我們的兒童劇社）籌備訊</h3>
<p>二十世紀是不但發現了人民的力量；而且兒童也開始明瞭了眞正的自救運動，去和一切否認兒童能力的及壓迫兒童成為奴隸的人們鬥爭了。尤其在這救亡的號角聲裏，進步的兒童已認淸他們的能力——和成人們同樣的「人」的能力，而預備聯結成一個廣大有力的兒童陣線，站在成人團體的同等地位上，和一切眞正革命的前進的成人團體緊緊握手。現在，得到了「我們的兒童劇社籌備委員會」成立的消息，可證明二十世紀的兒童確是舊勇地跳出了「附屬」的囚蘢，掙脫了奴隸的鐐銬，已用新的恣態，出現在這暴風雨時代裏，成為革命前線的戰鬥員了。</p>
<p>從「我們的兒童劇社」這名義，當然可了解這兒童劇社並不是藝術至上主　的，武自私的個人主義的玩意兒，而是屬於廣大的「我們——屬於新的光明的社會，人民大衆集體力量中的一份子。</p>
<p>現在「我們的兒童劇社籌備委員會」尚感人才不多；並為召集散佈各處的許多進步的兒童，使該社組織能更健全，幹部更　固起見，特公開微求同志，（十六歲以下，十三歲以上）。敬希一切進步的兒童自動地勇敢地參加。並請愛護兒童的先生們得了他們微求同志的消息後，立卽轉吿進步的兒童們。參加老先備函寄北西藏路橋堍華通坊七號海燕劇社或寄康腦脫路康腦邨內積　里五十號陸靜轉。或直接到海燕劇社找何拓薪面談，（時間每日下午三時至八時）或到積善里五十號找陸靜面談。（時間每日上午）</p>

        <h1>1936.08.26</h1>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Renmin Agree to Fly to Nanning to Mediate Peace; Chiang Kai-shek Convenes Military Conference in Whampoa; He Jian Willing to Go to Guilin to Negotiate; Rumor that Li and Bai Determined to Establish Independent Military Government and Prepare to Convene National Representative Assembly</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Deng Shizeng came to Hong Kong to request Chiang Guangnai and Zhang Renmin to come to the province to meet Chairman Chiang, and then fly to Guilin together to mediate with Li, Bai and Cai. Chiang and Zhang agreed. Deng returned to the province first on the 25th to report to Chairman Chiang. Chiang and Zhang will go to the province on the 26th to meet Chairman Chiang. The atmosphere for peace in Guilin is recovering. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) It is reported that Chairman He Jian of Hunan Province, who was rumored to arrive here on Sunday, has voluntarily offered to go to Guilin Province to personally urge Li and Bai to accept the conditions of the Central Government. Therefore, a new hope for peaceful resolution has arisen. It is estimated that Mr. He will fly to Nanning in three to four days. (25th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) He Jian and Xiong Shihui, summoned by telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, arrived in Guangzhou at 10 a.m. on the 24th via the Yuehan Railway. At 4 p.m., they went to the Whampoa Headquarters to meet Chiang Kai-shek and then convened a military conference. More than ten people, including Zhu Peide, Cheng Qian, Chen Cheng, Yu Hanmou, and Hu Zongnan, participated. (25th Allied Press)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Li, Bai and Cai have been actively deploying military affairs in recent days, and have decided to establish a puppet military government to resist. Liu Luyin, Pan Yihi, Zhang Renmin and others have been appointed to be responsible for planning various organizations, and a National Representative Assembly will be convened at the same time. In military terms, it has been decided to concentrate elite troops to launch attacks on Guangdong in three routes. For the borders of Hunan, Yunnan, and Guizhou, a guerrilla warfare strategy will be adopted to contain the Central Army. It has been internally decided that Li Zongren will be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the entire army, and Bai Chongxi and Cai Tingkai will be appointed as the Deputy Commanders-in-Chief. (25th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from the Chinese side here, there is renewed hope for a peaceful resolution in Guilin. It is reported that Bai Chongxi has already left for abroad. (25th Reuters)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Central Government expressed its intention for peace in Guilin. On the 24th, it ordered the troops stationed in Fengchuan and Guangning to withdraw thirty miles to dispel the doubts of Li and Bai. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed Bai and Li, requesting them to come to Hong Kong to meet with Cheng Qian to discuss peace methods. Cheng will go to Hong Kong after Li and Bai reply. If necessary, he may go to Guilin. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Huang Guoliang, Deputy Commander of the 67th Division of the Central Government, arrived in the province on the 25th to meet Chiang Kai-shek. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) Ju Zheng arrived in the province from Macau on the 24th and told a reporter from the Central News Agency that Xiao Focheng has gradually recovered. He will come to Guangdong in the autumn to meet with Chairman Chiang. Xiao is also very concerned about peaceful unification and hopes that the Guilin authorities will not go to extremes. (24th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Two torpedo boats from Guangdong Province that previously surrendered to the Central Government have completed repairs in Hong Kong. At noon on the 25th, they sailed back to the provincial river to rejoin the fleet. (25th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>National Government Orders Withdrawal of Arrest Warrants for Li and Chen</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Chiang of the Executive Yuan recently submitted a memorial to the National Government, requesting that the previous orders for the arrest of Chen Mingshu and Li Jishen be withdrawn. This has been approved and notified to the Military Affairs Commission of the Executive Yuan. The original Order No. 627 of the National Government is as follows: "For order and instruction, Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu were previously involved in the Fujian Incident, and orders for their arrest were issued. It is now found that Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu have shown remorse over the past three years and have made contributions to the revolution over the years, which should be recorded. The previous orders for the arrest of Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu are hereby withdrawn to encourage past efforts and observe future performance. In addition to separate orders to the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan, this order is hereby issued to the said commissions and Yuan for notification and to instruct all subordinates to take note of this order." (25th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Will Not Go to Guangdong for the Time Being</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, is scheduled to return to Nanjing from Shanghai on the evening of the 27th to preside over the general meeting on the 28th. According to Liang Hancao, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, since receiving the telegram from Li and Bai, Sun has replied urging them to accept the explicit orders. Li and Bai have not sent any other telegrams, and Sun has not sent any telegrams either. Sun will not go to Guangdong for the time being due to the busy affairs of the Legislative Yuan. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Hancao, Secretary-General of the Legislative Yuan, said that the Legislative Yuan meeting is scheduled to hold the 25th annual Sichuan Construction Public Bond of 35 million yuan issuance regulations on the 28th, and it is expected to be passed at the Yuan meeting on that day. It can be issued as scheduled on September 1. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The term of the fourth Legislative Committee will expire at the end of this year. According to the draft constitution, half of the future Legislative Committee members will be elected by the National Assembly, and half will be appointed by the government. However, whether the elected half can be elected on schedule is still a question. If it is produced on schedule, the fourth Legislative Committee will maintain the transition to avoid the cessation of legislative work. After the constitution is passed in the future, there will be about twenty or thirty kinds of attached laws and regulations to be formulated, which will be drafted by the new Legislative Committee. At present, there is no need to draft them for the time being due to time and various reasons. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jin Army Arrives in Eastern Sui to Strengthen Defense; Shi Huayan Meets with Song to Discuss the Situation on the Border of Chahar and Sui; Second Congress of the Sui-Mongolian Political Council to Be Held Soon</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Fu Zuoyi sent Shi Huayan to Ping to meet with Song Zheyuan to discuss the tense situation on the border of Chahar and Sui and requested that Liu Ruming be instructed to assist in case of emergency. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A visitor from Zhangjiakou said that although bandits on the Sui border are gathering, they have no intention of launching an attack. Zhang HaiPeng is currently serving as the Attendant Military Officer of the puppet Manchukuo. The military power in Rehe is under the jurisdiction of Wang Jingxiu, Commander of the Puppet Fifth Military District. HaiPeng's son, Junzhe, serves as the Cavalry Brigade Commander under Wang's command. He recently received an order to move towards Dolon to support the puppet Mongolian army. There are indeed no Japanese troops in that area because the time for a formal conflict has not yet arrived. The Jin army is good at defending. If it is the puppet army that comes to harass them, they can cope with it without any background. The Pingdiquan area is as peaceful as ever. The puppet army is busy reorganizing and replenishing military supplies and will not invade within a month. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The ambitions of the puppet Mongolian bandit army that invaded Sui have not yet been quelled. Except for the slightly well-equipped troops of Li ShouXin and Zhang HaiPeng, the bandit army in northern Chahar, such as Wang Ying and Bao Yueqing's troops, are all a motley crew. Their clothing and equipment are also extremely complex and dilapidated. However, the number exceeds 10,000, and the newly added troops from Jiabusi have also arrived one after another. Our defenses in eastern Sui are exceptionally solid. In addition to the Sui army, the Jin army's Li Fuying and other divisions have now arrived there. Their strength is strong, and their communication is very close. If the bandit army comes again, it will not be difficult to defeat them in one fell swoop. (25th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources concerned, the second congress of the Sui-Mongolian Political Council will be held soon. More than half of the committee members have arrived in Sui. The agenda for discussion includes the suppression of bandits, anti-communism, and construction issues. The construction funds are set at 200,000, which will be allocated upon approval by the Central Government. Shi Huayan, a councilor of the Mongol Political Council's Guidance Commissioner's Office, will return to Sui within days to attend the congress and guide everything because he has completed his official duties in Ping.

<h3>National Products Exhibition and National Products Market</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>It is difficult to fully understand the extent to which the national products industry has developed in recent years. Judging from the national products exhibitions held in various districts of this city, it cannot be said that there has been significant progress. Such exhibitions may not fully represent the entire national products industry, or they may only represent a small part of it. However, since they are named National Products Exhibitions, those who hear about them and do not examine them carefully may assume that they can get a glimpse of our country's national products industry, which would be a great disappointment.</p>
<p>The main purpose of a national products exhibition is originally to gather new products from various factories, classify and display them, so that people can observe, see progress, compare, and increase their knowledge. On the government side, it can use this to urge those with poor products to improve, and promote and protect those with excellent products, so as to make our country's industry develop soundly. On the other hand, it can also promote the interest of the general public in investing in the construction of the national products industry. Therefore, the National Products Exhibition should select novel and exquisite products to display. The government should lead the national products industry and hold it once a year. The so-called National Products Exhibition of today is entirely aimed at selling products, which is far from the original purpose of the exhibition.</p>
<p>Because of this, the exhibits are mainly household necessities. Knitwear accounts for almost half of them. In order to facilitate sales, prices have to be low. Because of the pursuit of low prices, the quality of the products cannot be considered. In order to quickly get rid of the goods, the reputation of the goods is also disregarded. Buyers initially greed for a temporary cheapness, and later deeply regret that the goods are not durable. They complain about the poor quality of national products. A bad impression is cast on the whole of national products.</p>
<p>Goods cannot be without good or bad, and prices cannot be without high or low. It is natural that cheap goods are not high-quality goods. However, if the price is set according to the cost of production, and the ambition is not to make a big profit, but to make the goods durable, I know that people will definitely flock to it. If the focus is only on making a big profit and calling for low prices, the only result is to make the credibility even more lost.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if manufacturers aim at selling products, it seems that they can set up national products markets, and add words such as "temporary", "mobile", and the name of the region to indicate its nature. They should not use the name of the National Products Exhibition for publicity. As for the National Products Exhibition, it should be held once a year or periodically under the leadership and guidance of the government, gathering the best and newest products from various factories, and carefully selecting them. If our city has held National Products Movement Weeks every year since 1928, the city-wide National Products Exhibition should be listed as the only work in the Movement Week to see how the national products industry has progressed in the past year. If so, factories can receive the effect of observing and learning from each other, and the people will also know what to strive for, so that the original purpose of the exhibition will not be lost.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Anti-Government Case: Zinoviev and Others Executed; Secret Execution of Fifteen Others</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union yesterday rejected the petitions for clemency from all the convicts. All sixteen defendants were executed according to the original sentence. (TASS dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The details of the execution of Zinoviev and fifteen others are still being kept strictly secret. The Soviet Russian authorities believe that the description of such executions would be too barbaric. All the property of the convicts has been confiscated. "Pravda" highly praised the judgment of this execution and published a resolution of tens of thousands of workers, which expressed strong support for the authorities' actions. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Zinoviev, the former Soviet Russian Communist leader who was shot today, was the protagonist of the world-famous mysterious "Red Letter" case. When this case occurred in 1924, it caused a great uproar in British political circles. The mysterious letter discovered in London was sent by Zinoviev, in his capacity as the leader of the Third International, to the British Communist Party. The content of the letter reportedly instructed the British Communists to use radical means to overthrow the then-British government and to incite the British army to achieve this goal. The British government immediately protested to the Soviet Russian chargé d'affaires in London, stating that this letter violated the conditions stipulated in the Anglo-Russian trade agreement, which stated that the Soviet Russian government should not participate in British political activities. At that time, the Soviet Russian government replied to Britain that the letter was a forgery and argued that the Third International and the Soviet Russian government should not be confused. Subsequently, Anglo-Russian relations deteriorated further as a result. However, the truth of this sensational Zinoviev letter has never come to light and may remain a historical mystery, like the famous "Jones Document" and the "Man in the Iron Mask."</p>
<p>Zinoviev was born in 1883 and is now 53 years old. He was originally one of the key members of the Communist Party and was also a leading figure in the Russian Revolution of 1917. Zinoviev first became known in 1903, when he served as editor-in-chief of several Russian newspapers. In 1908, he was imprisoned on suspicion of being a Communist. Later, he and Lenin were exiled to Switzerland. In 1917, Zinoviev and Lenin secretly returned to Russia at the same time. The German government, believing that the revolution in Russia would completely disintegrate the Russian army fighting on the front lines, specially allowed the two to pass through German territory. After Zinoviev returned to Russia, he immediately engaged in activities to overthrow the newly established Kerensky government, in order to support Lenin in presiding over the grand plan. After this, Zinoviev's power in Russia gradually declined. Finally, in 1925, he lost power due to the downfall of Trotsky and Kamenev. Therefore, Zinoviev was indeed a meritorious and hardworking member of the Communist Party. Therefore, although he was expelled from the party twice, in 1928 and 1932, he was reinstated because he expressed repentance. In 1932, it was widely rumored in Europe that Zinoviev had died. Zinoviev also disappeared without a trace for twelve months. It was not until the assassination of Kirov in 1934 that Zinoviev's name reappeared in the newspapers. As a result of the Soviet Russian government's investigation into counter-revolutionary activities in the country, Zinoviev and eighteen accomplices were arrested. After a trial, it was only found that Zinoviev had counter-revolutionary suspicions, but there was no evidence to confirm his involvement in the Kirov assassination. He was sentenced to ten years in prison and his property was confiscated. Unexpectedly, he has now been sentenced to death. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Germany Extends Military Service by One Year, Army Increases to One Million; Italy Also Increases Recruitment of Colonial Garrison; Large-Scale Aviation Exercise Held in Moscow</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Führer Hitler today ordered the extension of the term of military service for the German people from one year to two years. This move will increase the number of active German troops to one million, which is in response to Soviet Russia recently raising the age of conscription from 21 to 19. The Soviet Russian active army totals 1.3 million people. After the conscription age is lowered, it can increase by 250,000 people each year. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The above order was jointly signed and issued by Führer Hitler and Defense Minister von Blomberg. After the issuance of this order, the generals of the German Wehrmacht, who are already burdened with heavy work, will have even greater organizational responsibilities. Currently, new barracks are planned to be built throughout Germany, and more officers will be hired to train these additional soldiers. By October of this year, after the conscription of the 1916 class, Germany will have 200,000 regular troops with twelve years of service, and 350,000 strong each of the 1915 and 1916 classes. If soldiers from the years before the Great War are recalled, the number will be even more considerable. The total number of German troops is probably no less than one million. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The current German army has a total of 600,000 personnel, half of whom are career soldiers and half of whom are new recruits conscripted after the resumption of the conscription system last year. Now, after the extension of the term of military service, the peacetime military strength will naturally increase accordingly, and the number of reserves that can be mobilized in wartime is not included. According to the investigation, there are 598,000 German men born in 1914, 467,000 in 1915, 354,000 in 1916, 317,000 in 1917, 331,000 in 1918, 492,000 in 1919, and 647,000 in 1920, totaling 3,206,000 people. The Germans are physically strong, and the number of those who do not meet the qualifications for military service should be very small, at most only one-tenth. From this point of view, it is no exaggeration to say that Germany, which dominates the European continent, has a million elite soldiers. Moreover, the German military industry is second to none in Europe. Its products can supply the needs of this great army, and various economic organizations in the country can be adjusted and placed under wartime conditions in an instant. Is it not clear that a single order from Führer Hitler can make Germany leap to become the most powerful army country in Europe? (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The army authorities today called on the public to join the colonial army of Abyssinia, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. All soldiers who have been exempted from military service or are on extended leave can apply. The term of service is more than two years. Those who apply can get a bonus at the beginning of enlistment, and the peacetime salary is also higher than that of other troops. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

Especially interesting was the aerial attack and defense of a railway station. A French aviation delegation was also present. (TASS dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>German Defense Minister Promulgates Implementation Measures, Instructs Newspapers to Criticize Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>(Berlin) General von Blomberg, the Minister of Defense, has recently issued a decree implementing the measures to extend the term of compulsory military service. According to this measure, by July 1, 1937, the number of active German troops will reach a maximum of 1.2 million. However, by October 1, 1938, due to the fact that the new recruits are males born in 1917 (the year with the lowest birth rate), the number of troops will decrease to 900,000. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Chancellor today issued a new order that the actual term of service in the German Wehrmacht has been increased from one year to two years. This new order is based on the current National Defense Law. The detailed rules for the implementation of this new order will be issued by the Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, General von Blomberg. The National Socialist Party's public bulletin published the following commentary today: "Although the Olympic peace gathering is being held in Berlin, Germany has also allowed international people to witness the peace and order of the new Germany. However, cruel civil wars and economic struggles are everywhere. Many international groups intend to drag the world into the chaos of communism and want to make it succeed by force. In the past three years, the National Socialist Party has rescued Germany from the internal strife of Bolshevik slaughter and destruction. The security under the rule of the National Socialist Party is sufficient to increase Germany's economic development and restore prosperity. While the German National Socialist Party is working hard on construction, Spain is trapped in the desert created by the Communist Party. The National Socialist Party guarantees domestic peace and success, and at the same time, German military preparations can guarantee the same success in foreign peace. History tells us that it is better to make great sacrifices when necessary than to fall into the chaos of Bolshevism. Under the threat of Soviet Russian imperialism and its military force, Germany will take corresponding steps to ensure its own peace and its culture, and first ensure its freedom and independence." (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The National Socialist Party will hold a party congress in Nuremberg from September 8 to 14. At the same time, the House of Representatives will also hold an important meeting. The main item on the agenda is to pass a law on the future of German youth. It is widely believed that children above a certain age, regardless of class or education, will be separated from their families and parents to serve the country, in accordance with the Italian Balilla model. It is heard that boys will receive semi-military training, and girls will receive training in domestic science, farming, and nursing, so that they can be competent as mothers of the new Germanic nation in the future. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government recently decided to increase the term of military service from one year to two years. Before that, the National Socialist Party authorities instructed newspapers to launch fierce attacks on the Soviet Union's military preparations, in order to prove to domestic and foreign audiences that the Soviet Union's actions were directly targeted at Germany. At the same time, various propaganda agencies searched old files for various statistics and declarations previously issued by the Soviet authorities, in order to prove that the Soviet army is a revolutionary army. Therefore, Germany had to extend the term of military service as a preparation for it. According to the military measures taken by Germany in recent years, the Soviet Union has been used as an excuse. For example, when the government announced the restoration of the compulsory military service system on March 16 last year, the reason given was that the Soviet Union's active army had 960,000 personnel. On March 7 this year, Germany abolished the Locarno Treaty and marched into the Rhineland, using the Franco-Russian mutual assistance pact as an excuse to threaten Germany. Until recently, when the civil war broke out in Spain, the Soviet Union reduced the age of conscription. Germany then claimed that it had been threatened in all aspects. Now that the term of military service has been extended, the number of German troops will naturally increase accordingly. Although the number is lower than that of the Soviet Union, due to the relatively complete German economic organization, it is sufficient to compete with the Soviet Union. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This morning, all newspapers published the news of the extension of the term of compulsory military service with large headlines, and all expressed welcome, saying that this move will be of great benefit to the cause of peace. The National Socialist Party's organ, the "Völkischer Beobachter," stated, "Our country has no intention of fighting with anyone. What we have adopted is only a precautionary measure, and its purpose is also to protect our own country, so that we will not suffer from war." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated, "National Socialist Germany has not only established a barrier to prevent communism at home, but also abroad. In view of this, countries around the world do not need to worry about communism." The local guiding newspaper stated, "There is a neighboring country with a strong military, which is threatening our country more and more. The measures taken by the government now are aimed at consolidating its defense capabilities." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>France Greatly Alarmed, Discussing Countermeasures, But Not Intending to Lodge a Protest</h3>
<p>(Paris) After Germany decided to extend the term of military service, people from all walks of life here were greatly shocked upon hearing the news. However, political figures have temporarily refrained from making comments, only saying that Germany's move is extremely serious in nature, and its impact must be carefully studied. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The German government first restored the compulsory military service system on March 16 last year, then abolished the Locarno Treaty on March 7 this year and marched into the Rhineland region, and now decided to extend the term of military service. All of this is a consistent policy and is not surprising. Therefore, the French government does not intend to lodge any protests against Germany's move this time, nor does it intend to make any contact with the German government diplomatically, but will reserve the right to use other self-defense methods to safeguard its own security. Premier Léon Blum, Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos, and Minister of National Defense Édouard Daladier will convene a meeting as soon as possible to technically decide on various measures to deal with the new situation created by Germany's extension of the term of military service. At that time, the chiefs of staff of the navy, army, and air force may also participate in the secret meeting. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the newspapers unanimously expressed satisfaction with Germany's participation in the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war, they mostly expressed concern about the extension of the term of military service in that country. The Socialist Party's organ, "Le Populaire," believed that Germany's move was extremely important in nature. The best course of action for France now is to propose another suggestion to reduce armaments. "Because after Germany extended the term of military service, the arms race among countries around the world has entered an important stage. The repercussions and consequences that this can cause internationally are not difficult to imagine. If countries and nations want to prevent it, they can only make a final effort to curb this arms race through the only truly effective path. What is the path? That is, the countries concerned conclude an arms reduction treaty, gradually reduce existing armaments, and stipulate monitoring measures. Regarding this matter, it is necessary to arouse world public opinion to work for peace. Then, who is the best to speak out loudly and be the initiator for the world? Of course, it is the French Popular Front. "Le Petit Journal" stated that after Germany extended the term of military service, even more serious things will happen one after another. "If our prediction is not wrong, Hitler will soon announce that Germany intends to wage a 'preventive war' against Soviet Russia. Although Germany has declared its acceptance of the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war, this declaration has lost its value due to the extension of the term of military service. Today, German warships are already cruising in the Mediterranean Sea. Who knows if Germany's million troops will not exercise policing on the European continent tomorrow?" "Le Matin" stated, "Germany's military move will automatically affect the military systems of other countries. This is obvious." The right-wing "Le Figaro" stated that Germany had just expressed its acceptance of the non-intervention agreement, and then decided to extend the term of military service in the evening. How short is the time between the two? The spirit of compromise shown by Germany was unexpected by the general public beforehand. European authorities have thus obtained a moment of relief. Unfortunately, this expression of compromise is only like a flash in the pan, and a bolt from the blue will follow." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Figures Believe It Is Commonplace, No Need to Submit to League of Nations for Discussion</h3>
<p>(London) Political figures recently declared that Germany's extension of the term of military service cannot be submitted to the League of Nations for processing, because that country's restoration of the compulsory military service last year was a violation of the Treaty of Versailles, and there is no new violation this time. Moreover, such actions may seem extremely serious at first glance, but in reality, they are not as serious as people imagine. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) After German Führer Hitler ordered the increase of the term of military service from one year to two years, political figures here were greatly surprised and uneasy. They all said that at a time when the European situation is already very complicated, Germany's sudden adoption of this decision is shocking. Right-wing figures believe that the Soviet Russian People's Committee recently resolved that the conscription age for new recruits in that country should be reduced from 21 to 19. Germany's move is aimed at Russia and is in line with reason. However, left-wing and moderate figures believe that the German authorities had already made this decision and are now simply using the Soviet Union's resolution as an excuse. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italy Expresses Approval, But Did Not Receive Information in Advance</h3>
<p>(Rome) After German Führer Hitler issued an order yesterday to increase the term of military service from one year to two years, political figures here expressed their approval, believing that the threat of international communism is already imminent. If you want to prevent it, there is only one way to strengthen national defense. The purpose of the steps taken by Germany this time is to protect the peace and order of Western Europe. It is difficult to believe the rumor that the country has been deliberately trying to use this move to establish an anti-communist group of four countries, Italy, Germany, Austria, and Hungary, in Central Europe. It is not true that Italy was informed in advance. However, ever since the Soviet Union reduced the age of conscription for new recruits, anyone who is well-informed has long expected that Germany would take this action. In short, Italy has always advocated that Germany expand its military strength to be on par with other countries and restore equal rights. Therefore, Germany's decision should be considered satisfactory. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the meeting between Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy and German Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden, Germany, yesterday, observers here recently expressed their opinions, saying that the purpose of this meeting was to unite the defeated countries of the European War and organize a "revisionist" front. As a result, the tense situation in Europe will inevitably become more serious. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Newspapers of Various Countries Express Concern, Considering It a New Factor in International Disputes</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the German government extended the term of military service yesterday, the number of regular troops in that country will increase to 1,000,000. There are also 500,000 personnel in other paramilitary organizations. Newspapers in various European countries have expressed concern about this matter, considering it a new factor causing international disputes. The Austrian "Neue Freie Presse" stated, "It is inferred that Germany will formally demand to build defensive fortifications in the Rhineland region at this time. The number of troops in that country before the European War was only 900,000, but now it is more than before the war. But this is the fault of the Soviet Union." The Polish government-affiliated newspapers also stated that "Germany's move is to respond to the Soviet Russian threat," but the opposition newspapers in that country stated that Germany had just accepted the non-intervention agreement in the Spanish civil war and then extended the term of military service. This action is still a trick of "advancing by retreating, making people laugh and cry." In addition, Swedish newspapers stated that the powerful countries along the Baltic Sea are now taking dangerous policies, and this country must immediately strengthen its national defense as a preparation for it. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>US Quartermaster General Tells National Arms Dealers</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Army Quartermaster General Shepherd today warned the national arms manufacturing industry, "Prepare for wartime operations." This shows the serious attitude of the United States towards the European situation. Shepherd said that US arms factories should be prepared to meet wartime production capacity at any time. At the same time, he wrote in the Quartermaster Association magazine that the design for national defense has become the most important issue since the end of the European War. The Army Department deeply feels that once a war breaks out, the US industry must produce a large part of the required weapons and ammunition. However, the Army Department opposes the proposal of the investigation committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives to requisition all arms industries and national manufacture of weapons and ammunition to prevent profiteering. Shepherd also said that although he does not believe that the current crisis in Europe will lead to a world war, the severity of the crisis has prompted the United States to maintain a plan that can be used at any time. Democratic Senator Reynolds has a different opinion from Shepherd on the issue of nationalizing weapons and ammunition. Reynolds advocates that if there is a war, the arms industry should be nationalized, because the country can conscript troops and can develop weapons manufacturing.

<h3>Palestine Issue: Jews Dissatisfied with Iraqi Mediation</h3>
<p>Jerusalem: Regarding the dispute between Arabs and Jews, it is reported that political figures from Iraq and Transjordan are now acting as mediators. Secret negotiations have already been underway between the Palestinian government and Arab leaders. The Jewish newspapers here are expressing strong dissatisfaction with these negotiations, deeply concerned that the mediators are not considering Jewish interests. At the same time, Arab extremists believe that any solution that can be agreed upon by both sides may not be acceptable to the Arab community. In addition, the British government has dispatched a battalion of the "Royal Sussex Regiment" from Malta's Valletta port to assist the garrison in maintaining local order. The battalion is scheduled to depart from the port tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Institute of Pacific Relations: Hu Shih Points out that Japan is Obstructing Our Construction; China is Seeking Self-Reliance; Japanese Representative to Respond Today</h3>
<p>Yosemite: The sixth conference of the Institute of Pacific Relations continued yesterday afternoon. First, the Chinese representative, Dr. Hu Shih, Dean of the Faculty of Arts of Peking University in China, delivered a speech, severely criticizing Japan's policy towards China. He stated, "Any Chinese government that is powerful enough to unify the country and enhance its national status will not be tolerated by Japan. This has almost become a fixed policy in Japan." Therefore, Japan is responsible for China's difficult situation. The Chinese nation is now determined to fight to the end to maintain its own survival. As far as the three northeastern provinces are concerned, Japan's military occupation of the area has created a state of war with China. Not only is China's economic reconstruction movement being obstructed, but also the cooperation between other countries and China is unable to proceed. The intention is to prevent the revival of the Chinese nation. After Hu Shih's speech, the Japanese representative immediately stood up to express his opposition and stated that he would respond point by point tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Yosemite: The Institute of Pacific Relations continued its conference today. Chinese representative Dr. Hu Shih stated in his speech that China has recognized that all kinds of world peace organizations have been destroyed beyond repair. China must rely on its own efforts in the future. As for the three principles of Japanese Prime Minister Hirota, Hu Shih declared that Japan's ultimate goal is clearly to completely control China politically, but China is determined to continue fighting. An independent China is now engaged in the construction of railways, aviation, education, and disaster relief as a material foundation for national unification. China currently has 100,000 kilometers of railways, which the National Government was able to use to suppress the Communist Party and the previous rebellion in Fujian. As for the nature of Sino-Russian relations, only time will tell. Pierson, a member of the US Foreign Policy Association, declared that the best way to solve the China problem is for all countries to agree to allow China to build with peace of mind, without the need to resist foreign aggression by force. Expert Tyler stated that China's economy, society, and culture are undergoing drastic changes, and it is difficult to predict the future, but international relations will inevitably become more complicated as a result. The progress of China's construction is extremely unbalanced, and it does not have a predetermined goal and a consistent plan like Soviet Russia. Its steps change with the situation. Although there has been considerable progress in politics, economic construction has not developed in a balanced way. The dualism of government agencies is sufficient to hinder progress. But politically, China is a whole country. The organs and symbols of the central government's power, such as the national defense forces, national banks, tax collection agencies, and airports in major cities, are all sufficient to indicate change and progress. This new organization will obviously make the international situation more complicated, and its stability will be affected by the politics and situation of various countries. The Chinese representative also read out a paper on China's new monetary policy and the recent development of China's cotton industry to the conference, and asked the representatives to pay attention to the fierce competition between Japanese spinning mills and Chinese merchants. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Yosemite: The Chinese representative declared to the Pacific Conference today that China welcomes assistance from all countries for its construction, but does not want Japanese interference. The Japanese representative immediately refuted this, insisting that China's only hope is in unity and construction, and Japan's only wish is to cooperate with China. The Chinese representative also replied that Japan often transmits the idea of cooperation to the Chinese people but the Chinese people are unable to understand the true meaning of their cooperation. The US representative declared that while the United States has always respected China's sovereignty, it should also consider the most-favored-nation clause. This clause has forced China to sign the majority of international treaties, damaging its sovereignty. The Chinese representative also stated that the Canadian Overseas Chinese Bank has lent US$500,000 to support China's construction, but Japan does not want China to negotiate loans with foreign countries. China will never again make political concessions or allow outsiders to discuss the statement made by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman that foreign countries are not allowed to interfere in Chinese affairs. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>Yosemite: The Japanese representative to the Pacific Institute today afternoon requested a special meeting to be convened on Tuesday in order to respond to the Chinese representative's remarks that Japan is obstructing China's recovery. (National Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Talks About Our Country Clearing Foreign Debts; Payment of Interest on the Longhai and Guangzhou-Kowloon Bonds; Major Articles Published in London Newspapers</h3>
<p>(London) Today, this newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the UK, and discussed the recent clearing of loans and the fact that Chinese bonds are now more popular than they were a few years ago. Ambassador Guo responded, "China has indeed made progress and is worthy of great respect." The editors of London's financial publications have all published the news of the recent clearing of foreign debts in prominent positions. "The Financial Times" published an article by Dr. Pan, Secretary-General of the Chinese Ministry of Railways, solemnly stating the Chinese government's emphasis on clearing various debts and restoring national credit, and especially hoping to obtain new funds for the construction of new railways. He also stated that the Chinese government has great sincerity towards all creditors and hopes that creditors can show the same spirit in negotiations and recognize the changes in China and the world situation. In recent months, various circles here have had an optimistic view of the current situation in China. Nanjing's swift handling of the Southwest Incident has given a good impression here. Many observers say that since the February 26 Tokyo Incident this year, Japan's policy towards China has not been as disruptive as before. A few observers expressed regret over the cancellation of some railway debts, but still welcomed the various agreements reached between the Chinese government and bondholders, because they have a clear understanding of China's difficulties and its desire to repay the debts as soon as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Stock Exchange's reaction to the Chinese government's declaration of resuming interest payments on the Longhai and Guangzhou-Kowloon railway bonds has been inconsistent. Because rumors that the Longhai railway loan would soon resume interest payments have been circulating for a long time, the immediate impact of this declaration was only a slight drop in the price of the bonds. Several parties expressed disappointment that the interest rate did not exceed 1.5% at the beginning. As for the market, it believes that the current trend of Longhai railway bonds is due to too many buyers, resulting in the exhausted bulls being liquidated. On the other hand, some believe that the interest on the Longhai bonds will be at least equal to the interest paid on the Guangzhou-Kowloon bonds within two years. This is why Longhai bonds sell better than Guangzhou-Kowloon bonds. The sudden rise in the price of Guangzhou-Kowloon bonds from around £33 to £42 in recent days has surprised many people, because it was generally expected that the bonds would not pay 2% or 1.5% interest in the short term. However, the market believes that the different price trends of the above two bonds are due to the difference in the total amount in circulation in the market. Currently, the amount of Guangzhou-Kowloon bonds that have not been paid is only £171,000 in interest and £940,000 in principal, while Longhai bonds have as much as £4,000,000. The current selling price of Longhai bonds is £32, while the buying price of Guangzhou-Kowloon bonds is £42. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides on Important National Policies, Divided into Seven Categories</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Based on the statement made when the cabinet was formed, in order to reform the administration and establish important national policies, the government has organized and adopted the following policies from the more than 30 national policies proposed by various ministries, and the cabinet announced their content on the 25th.</p>

<p>(7) Organizing and improving the administrative structure. (Domei dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The regular cabinet meeting held on the 25th to decide on the new national policies of the Hirota Cabinet began at 9:30 AM at the Prime Minister's official residence. After deciding on the items of important national policies, Prime Minister Hirota rose to express his views, saying that among the policies proposed by various ministers, those that are considered important and related to the budget should be approved as listed in the attached document. He also hoped that the bills related to this matter would be prepared urgently. Regarding matters related to various ministries, he hoped that the ministries would carefully discuss and draft specific plans, and those that are not related to the budget should also be studied and implemented, such as the Ministry of Justice's research, investigation, and organization of laws and regulations. Then, two or three cabinet members spoke, saying that the national policy items need to be more specific. As a result, the decision on the items was the first step towards making them concrete in the future. The scope of the national policies decided by the current cabinet is limited, so following the Prime Minister's explanation, after the decision, Minister of Justice Hayashi asked, what measures will be taken for those not included in the national policy items? The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance replied that they would consider them appropriately. The meeting adjourned at 11:30 AM. (Domei dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Argentina Joins England and France in Mediating the Spanish Civil War, Stating the Goal is Only to Avoid Cruel Acts; Ambassadors of Various Countries Exchange Opinions in France</h3>
<p>(London) Diplomatic circles recently announced that envoys from several countries stationed in Spain, currently taking refuge in Andaye, southern France, have jointly drafted a proposal to be presented to the two warring factions in Spain, with the aim of preventing the ongoing mutual slaughter between the left and right wings, and the massacre of civilians. Argentine Ambassador Mancilla has contributed greatly to the negotiations regarding this matter, and the ambassadors of England and France have also participated. The Foreign Ministry is currently studying this proposal. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Madrid – American Ambassador to Spain, Bowers, currently residing in Andaye on the French-Spanish border, has attempted to find ways to alleviate the suffering of the people caused by the civil war. Argentine Ambassador to Spain, Mancilla, is currently discussing with the ambassadors of England, France, and other countries every day to alleviate the suffering of the war. This plan is currently being considered by the governments of the countries concerned. It is said that the ambassadors of the countries concerned have solemnly stated that they have no intention of mediating; their only wish is to provide some assistance to prisoners of war and other people affected by the war. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissar, Litvinov, today informed the French Ambassador that Soviet Russia has agreed to France's proposal of non-interference in Spanish affairs. According to Litvinov, if Germany, Italy, and Portugal also join the agreement, Soviet Russia will prohibit the export of its own weapons, ammunition, airplanes, etc., to Spain. Soviet Russia will also prohibit the fulfillment of various arms contracts placed with Russia by Spain. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the agreement on non-interference in the Spanish civil unrest proposed by France, Germany has already responded, promising to prohibit the shipment of arms to Spain. Official sources here have expressed satisfaction with this reply. However, just as one wave subsides, another rises. Germany has suddenly decided to extend the length of military service, and the general public believes that this move will add another factor of unrest to the European situation. Therefore, the sense of satisfaction has been diminished at once. France, England, Germany, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia are all arms-manufacturing countries. Now, they are all competing to agree to the conclusion of an agreement of non-interference in the Spanish civil unrest. Italy, due to two reservations, is still hesitant, but in view of Germany's decision, it should follow suit without further consideration. Some people here advocate that countries that have already implemented arms embargoes should send representatives to hold a meeting to discuss everything, so that the authorities of various countries, once the Spanish issue has a concrete solution, can step up preparations for the next League of Nations General Assembly and the Locarno Five-Power Conference. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Lisbon – A radio broadcast from Seville by General Rano, leader of the Spanish rebels, received here today, claimed that hundreds of Catalan refugees in Italy have begun to organize anti-communist volunteers, intending to join forces with the Spanish Nationalist Party to fight together. If they come to Seville, they will be warmly welcomed so that they can work together to reconquer Spain. Rano also claimed that the rebels had destroyed a team of government troops attacking Cordoba because these communist troops had no fighting spirit, and their defeated generals had surrendered to the rebels. Finally, Rano said, "We are determined to eliminate Marxism because it violates human civilization." (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Madrid – The government recently announced that railway traffic between Seville and Cordoba in the south has been cut off, and government troops have begun to attack the city of Cordoba on the outskirts of the city. The government army artillery is bombarding strategic locations occupied by the rebels. Prime Minister Quirol also stated that he would issue an important announcement after the cabinet meeting today. It is generally believed that the important announcement referred to by the Prime Minister refers to the surrender of the rebels in Oviedo, because the rebels in the area are now in dire straits and are about to surrender. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Madrid – Six rebel airplanes today scattered leaflets over the capital, calling on the people to break away from the Communist Party. The airplanes then flew to Toledo to drop food to the besieged rebels. According to sources here, the government has requested Catalonia to send airplanes to reinforce them. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Burgos – The revolutionary army of the city of Toledo is now trapped in the Alcazar in the city, and the food supply is running low. A team of airplanes belonging to the revolutionary army recently flew from here to drop food to provide assistance, and bombed the attacking government troops to relieve the siege. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Andaye – A large number of Moroccan troops who arrived in Burgos by plane from Spanish Morocco will join the Guadaramar line tomorrow or join the battle. It is feared that the stalemate in the Spanish civil war will be broken as a result. The rebels claimed that they would bomb Madrid in the early hours of today. The Spanish government initially denied this statement, but now it has officially acknowledged that this did indeed happen. However, according to Madrid military authorities, only the military airfield in Getafe, ten miles from the capital, was bombed by enemy planes, causing very little damage. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Andaye – It has been learned that the Spanish revolutionary army cruiser "Canarias" today again bombarded the city of San Sebastian, but the shells fired all landed outside the city, causing no damage. In addition, four airplanes belonging to the revolutionary army dropped 58 bombs on the city of Irun and the newly built trenches of government troops nearby this morning. It is said that the government troops suffered extremely heavy losses, and more than one hundred civilians were killed. However, this statement has not been confirmed, but according to a report from the correspondent of this newspaper from the city of Irun, although the city has been repeatedly bombarded by the revolutionary army by sea and air in recent days, and four airplanes came to drop bombs this morning, the damage suffered was very small, and no lives were lost. The train station in the city was one of the targets of the revolutionary army's bombing. A shell landed near the repair shop, but the workers in the factory continued to work as usual. The residents of the city were not panicked. Various trucks, either carrying armed men or carrying various goods, drove back and forth without interruption. On the square, dozens of children were seen playing hand in hand, enjoying themselves. However, near the City Hall and the Convent of the Virgin, people's hearts were more agitated. Many people were standing in front of the Military Commission, waiting to be enlisted in the army to assist in the battle. All organizations in the city have now been purely militarized. Most of the strong men have been enlisted in the army and are being trained by professional soldiers. The reporter of this newspaper met with many members of the militia group and was able to talk to each other. These people were planning to go to the front line of Fontes to fight. Among them were many foreigners. According to the talk, the front-line positions were heavily defended by well-trained soldiers and were extremely strong. New forces were constantly going to the rear to strengthen the defense. All supplies could also be delivered on time without being lacking. These people believed that the rebels' attempt to attack the city of Irun would not succeed. During the conversation, the sound of artillery fire was loud. The shells fired by the Guadarupe battery of the government troops passed over the city of Irun, and the cannons outside the city also began to bombard, and the sound shook the vicinity. However, this kind of situation has become commonplace in Irun, and people no longer pay attention to it. At 5:30 in the afternoon, the revolutionary army cruiser "Canarias" continued to bombard, and a shell fell near the Guadarupe battery. The soldiers guarding the battery immediately returned fire, and then the two sides exchanged fire until 7:00 in the evening. On the afternoon of the same day, a government plane also bombed a pineapple garden occupied by the revolutionary army on Mount Arenda. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>Revised Prices for Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) It was reported a few days ago that the Ministry of Communications had revised the prices for domestic telegrams. The reporter recently inquired with the Ministry of Communications and obtained accurate information: (1) Domestic telegrams were originally divided into within-province and out-of-province. Since the 17th year, they were revised to be the same nationwide, one dime per word. Now, the ministry believes that this method is slightly unfair, and it has been decided that from September 1st, it will be changed back to seven cents per word within the province, and out-of-province telegrams will still be charged one dime per word. (2) The method of calculating the fees for the address of Chinese telegrams has also been revised. Previously, it was originally stipulated that the name and address of the recipient within 15 characters would be charged as five characters. Now, it has been changed to one character for every two characters, and the remaining number of characters less than two characters is also counted as one character. It applies equally to both within-province and out-of-province telegrams. (Central News Agency Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>Joint Memorial Week of the Guangdong Party, Government, and Military: Full Text of Chairman Chiang's Report</h3>
<p>Guangzhou News - The full text of Chairman Chiang's report at the Guangdong Joint Memorial Week on the 24th is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow Comrades, today, taking advantage of the opportunity of this memorial week, I will give you a brief report on my views on "Building Guangdong into a Model Province of the Three Principles of the People." Now, how are we going to work hard to improve the current situation in Guangdong and build a model province of the Three Principles of the People? Of course, all comrades from the Party, Government, Military, and Education must work hard to ensure that Party affairs are sound, politics are clear, military affairs are organized, and education and the economy are developed. In particular, we must earnestly achieve the three primary tasks that Zhongzheng said: (1) eradicate poverty and filth, (2) prohibit opium and gambling, and (3) never seize the people's interests. However, I believe that everyone has paid close attention to these matters and is working hard to do them, so I will not repeat them. What Zhongzheng wants to say today is what is the active and fundamental task that comrades from the Party, Government, Military, and Education should jointly strive for in the future to build a model province of the Three Principles of the People? In other words, where should we start building at the beginning? I think that the most important and urgent task among the myriad of tasks is to build a new province, social order, and create a new social atmosphere, that is, to change the atmosphere and revitalize people's hearts. Since Zhongzheng arrived in Guangdong, I have felt that in the past two weeks, due to the joint efforts of comrades from the Party, Government, and Military, the entire social order of Guangdong has been restored, and everything is relatively organized. However, everyone must know that what we have done now is only restoring the original old order, and we have not further built a new order of modern society. The old order that has been restored now is almost the same as the situation in the former Qing era twenty or thirty years ago. This is not the order of modern society that I am talking about. Therefore, in the future, we must go further and build the new order of modern society in Guangdong very quickly. Specifically, it is to ask everyone to reform all the bad customs, habits, thoughts, and actions of the past, change the old order to the new order, change the old atmosphere to the new atmosphere, and change the old life to the new life. We must do this first, and then all aspects of construction work can be quickly promoted, and the model province of the Three Principles of the People can be built as soon as possible. Everyone must know that to build a modern country, we do not necessarily need sophisticated weapons and powerful military equipment. The most important thing is that the general public has noble morals and the entire country has a noble personality. As long as the personality of our general public and the entire country can be improved, even without sophisticated weapons and powerful military equipment, foreigners will not dare to despise us, let alone invade us. We will definitely be able to build an independent and free modern country of the Three Principles of the People. For example, there are many small countries in Europe that do not have strong military power, and even do not have troops in the country, only police. However, because the morals of their general public are very rich, and the personality of the entire country is also improved as a result, they are respected. The neighboring imperialists cannot despise him even if they want to, and they do not dare to invade him. This is the most obvious example. The ancients said, "People must insult themselves before others insult them." The reason why we are so humiliated and invaded by others now, fundamentally speaking, is not because we have too few troops and poor weapons. It is really because our general public is backward in knowledge, especially because our morals have fallen, and there are too many weaknesses in all aspects of life habits, thoughts, and actions. Because of self-humiliation, we invite foreign insults. Therefore, to resist foreign insults and build a modern country, we must rectify the source, improve the moral personality of the general public, that is, to build a modern social order, and fundamentally improve the status of our country. This is the path we must follow to build a country, and it is also the key point of our efforts to build a model province of the Three Principles of the People in the future. Everyone may feel that the truth I am talking about is too superficial and empty, and it does not seem that simple and easy to enrich national power and avoid invasion. However, I want to tell you that if we want to build a modern country, we cannot start without first improving the moral personality of the general public. Especially to build a model province of the Three Principles of the People in Guangdong, according to my research results in the past two weeks, I believe that the first important thing at present is to hurry up and build a new Guangzhou, that is, to transform the social order of Guangzhou, in order to change the atmosphere of Guangzhou and revitalize the hearts of the people of the whole country. Apart from this, there is no other way. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>De Wang Actively Expands Bandit Troops; Someone Supplies Money and Arms</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou Communication: According to well-informed sources, De Wang is now under heavy siege, and the princes of Inner Mongolia are fighting each other for leadership. It is difficult to survive without outside help. Therefore, De Wang and a certain party have a secret compromise agreement, and they provide money and arms to enable De Wang to expand the autonomous army. Now De Wang is actively active, sending people everywhere to recruit bandits to go to Inner Mongolia for organization. Tianjin has sent a certain Ma to live in the Japanese concession to contact the representatives of the bandits stationed in Tianjin, and Li Zixiang has been sent from the war zone to recruit bandits. As for Li Guodong, who has been lurking in the Japanese concession for a long time for military activities, he is now active in Mongolia.

<h3>Yellow River Floods into Shandong and into the Sea; Each Section of the Project Was Once Tense, But Quickly Stabilized; Li Sheng Village Exceeded Last Year's Breach Water Level; Kong Xiangrong Went Downstream to Inspect the Estuary</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Yellow River, with the heavy flow from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Dayong in the upper reaches, rushes down. The momentum is extremely fierce. This province has been on strict alert for the past two days. The county magistrates of the counties along the river, which have the most dangerous projects in the upper reaches of the province, have received telegrams from Chairman and Director of the River Affairs Bureau Han Fuju, ordering them to stay on the dike and supervise the construction and rescue. The water entered Shandong Province yesterday (22nd). From morning to 12 o'clock at night, Li Sheng Village rose by 1.4 meters. By 6 o'clock this morning (23rd), it continued to increase, and the water level reached 58.7 meters, exceeding the highest water level at the time of the breach in the 24th year by 2 cm, and rising by 9.5 cm from 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The middle reaches of Luokou also rose. This morning at 6 o'clock, it rose by 3 cm, and at 6 o'clock in the evening, it rose by another 4.3 cm. The water head has passed and flowed into the sea. Li Sheng Village has fallen by 1.5 cm at 6 o'clock tonight, and it will probably continue to fall and restore the original number. The once tense flood may be calmed down. When the water passed through the upper and middle sections of this province, the dangerous projects on both sides were quite tense. According to the telegraphic report from Wang Zhicheng, the flood control officer of the North Fourth Section, and Lu Chuanlun, the section chief, of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, Zhang Xinzhuang, the 10th, 13th, 14th, and 15th earth dams in Luoyang County, were washed up and re-hung due to the autumn flood. They have been bundled with hemp bags for rescue. According to the telegraphic report from Zhuang Shouzhong, the magistrate of Donghe County, Han Hongze, the flood control officer of the North Second Section, and Liu Fuyan, the flood season chief, the stone protection along the Fanpo Civil Levee collapsed for more than five feet. They are preparing piles and materials to transfer labor to step up rescue, and it is now stable. Kong Xiangrong, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, is currently inspecting his mother in Qingdao Province. Hearing the Yellow River warning, he is scheduled to take a train west from Qingdao tonight and arrive in Jinan tomorrow (24th). Kong is also preparing to go to the downstream estuary to inspect in order to stipulate the work of excavating the silt at the estuary. Here are two telegraphic reports on flood rescue in the upper section of the province: (1) Han Jun, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government of Jinan and Director of the River Affairs Bureau, checks that the water level of Zhukou has risen by 1.4 meters from yesterday morning to 12 o'clock at night. The flow is shifting south. All sweeping dams are taking large flows. Fortunately, the sweeping dams are consolidated, and there is no change. The first dam has four sweeping dikes, and the second dam has one and two sweeping dikes with horizontal lines. They have now been stabilized by pressing with hemp bags. The water has fallen by one inch this morning. The water level of Dongzhuang is now 58.7 meters and has not yet fallen. I am reporting this by telegram. Hu Renxuan, flood control officer of the South First Section, kowtows. (2) Han Jun, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government of Jinan and Director of the River Affairs Bureau, checks that from Wu to Mao, the river water has risen sharply by more than one inch. The water is touching the dike by three to five inches. The flow is turbulent and extremely fierce. In addition to dispatching civilians to supervise the engineering soldiers, dividing the sections for defense day and night, knowing the importance of the pass, I am reporting this by telegram first. Huang Zundian, Chief of the Gaoyian Engineering Bureau, and Liang Jingou, engineer of Shouzhang County, kowtow together.</p>

<h3>Effective Methods for Preventing Rice Stem Borers, Aphids, and Locusts (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Fuzhen, Dean of the College of Agriculture, Zhejiang University</p>
<p>1.  Timely Implementation is Key For example, lighting lamps must be done when rice stem borer moths first appear. Otherwise, most moths have already laid eggs, making it useless to lure and kill them. Similarly, egg collection must be done at the first sign of egg laying. Otherwise, most of the eggs have already hatched, and collecting empty egg masses is of little practical benefit.</p>
<p>2.  Cooperation is Essential If lamps are lit in one area but not in others, moths from all areas will gather in the illuminated area, causing rice paddies near the lights to be covered in egg masses. Similarly, if eggs are collected in one area but not in others, rice stem borers in the uncollected areas will mature into moths and fly to the collected area, diminishing the effectiveness of egg collection.</p>
<p>3.  Thorough Implementation is Necessary Rice stem borers have an extremely high reproductive rate, as mentioned earlier. If egg collection, moth capture, and rice root digging are not done thoroughly, the remaining few stem borers will quickly multiply to a very large number. Farmers often say that rice stem borer control is futile because the work is not thorough enough.</p>
<p>(B) Aphids</p>
<p>Aphids have different names in different regions, such as "greasy bugs" or "oily bugs." There are many types, some harming various vegetables, some harming various fruit trees, and some harming various crops. However, their life habits are mostly similar, so the control methods are also similar. The common cotton aphid will now be used as an example:</p>
<p>(1) The Life Cycle of an Aphid</p>
<p>Aphids are insects with gradual metamorphosis, having three stages in their life: egg, nymph, and adult. Adults have winged and wingless forms due to seasonal changes and migration. They reproduce through live birth and egg laying, and their reproductive rate is very high, with two to three dozen generations per year. They usually reproduce through live birth in the spring, and the aphids born are all females. These mother aphids can give birth without mating with males. This method of reproduction is called parthenogenesis. A mother aphid can produce an average of 33 offspring. When the climate is suitable and food is abundant, the offspring can reproduce a second generation of aphids after four or five days. If we do an ideal calculation of this reproduction rate, assuming that a mother aphid's offspring, from May to September, all grow up, the number of descendants would reach 2,345,734,188,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. If these cotton aphids are calculated at one cubic millimeter per individual, the accumulated volume would be larger than the Earth. This great reproductive power is truly frightening! Therefore, if there are one or two cotton aphids in a cotton field, they must be quickly eliminated, otherwise the field will soon be full of them.</p>
<p>Live-born females are mostly wingless, but when it is time to migrate, winged females will be produced to move from one place to another. In late October, parthenogenesis stops, and male and female aphids are produced. Males are winged, and females are wingless. After mating, they lay eggs. A female aphid lays 11-12 eggs at most and 3-4 eggs at least. These eggs overwinter on plants in the field. In March of the following year, when the weather warms up, they hatch into the first generation of female aphids, which parasitize shepherd's purse and reproduce offspring through parthenogenesis. Later, they migrate to cotton or various melons to cause harm.</p>
<p>(2) Effective Control Methods for Aphids</p>
<p>Based on the above description, aphid control methods can be divided into two steps: first, egg removal; and second, insect removal.</p>
<p>(1) Egg Removal The peak period for cotton aphids to lay eggs is in mid-November. If we pull out the cotton stalks before they lay eggs, dry them, and burn them as fuel, we can reduce the opportunity for egg laying. After the cotton stalks are removed, winter plowing should be carried out to bury the remaining cotton branches and leaves in the soil. At the same time, weeds along the edge of the field should be removed and burned to eliminate overwintering aphid eggs and prevent aphid outbreaks the following year.</p>
<p>Overwintering aphid eggs hatch in March. After hatching, they mostly parasitize on shepherd's purse. Therefore, if we remove and burn this weed in early spring, we can eliminate even the remaining overwintering aphid eggs.</p>
<p>(2) Insect Removal Insect removal means eliminating aphid nymphs and adults. Because aphids are very small and have sucking mouthparts, we must use a pesticide that can kill them on contact. There are many types of pesticides, but the following three are the most effective and economical:</p>
<p>A. Cotton Oil Emulsion The formula is one jin of soap, two jin of clear water, and two and a half jin of cotton oil. Preparation method: First, cut the soap into small pieces, add water, and boil until dissolved. At the same time, put the cotton oil in a pot and heat it slowly. When the cotton oil is heated to near boiling (around 70 degrees Celsius), slowly pour it into the hot soapy liquid and stir rapidly with a wooden stick until thoroughly mixed and the mixture becomes a semi-liquid emulsion. This liquid is the stock solution and must be diluted 80 times with water before application. When diluting, first add two to three times the volume of warm water slowly and stir rapidly with a wooden stick until thoroughly mixed, then add cold water to reach 80 times the original volume. This diluted emulsion must be sprayed on the insects using a sprayer, otherwise it will be ineffective. Cotton aphids usually gather on the underside of leaves, so it is best to use a curved leaf-bottom spray nozzle when spraying. Sprayers are available at the Central Agricultural Industrial Institute. They are lightweight, flexible, and reasonably priced. You can go there to purchase them.</p>
<p>B. Kerosene Emulsion The formula is one tael of soap, one jin of clear water, and two jin of kerosene. The preparation and application method can refer to the cotton oil emulsion treatment above. However, when using this agent, dilute it with water 30 to 40 times.</p>
<p>C. Tobacco Water Take one jin of tobacco leaves, add 15 jin of water, and soak overnight to make tobacco water. Spraying it on aphids with a sprayer can also kill them.</p>
<p>The raw materials for the above three pesticides are readily available everywhere, and preparation and application are also very convenient. If you have aphids, you can choose one of them to implement prevention and control.</p>

<h3>Sun Ke Returns to Shanghai, Discusses: National Assembly to be Convened as Scheduled Central Colleagues Agree to Grant Amnesty to Political Prisoners Details of Guangxi Incident Unknown, Hope Li and Bai Understand Soon</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, took advantage of the Legislative Yuan's vacation to go to Lushan for summer. Now that the vacation is over, he returned to Nanjing a few days ago to handle Yuan affairs. He took the night train from Nanjing to Shanghai the night before last, arriving at Zhenru Station at around 7:00 a.m. yesterday. He went straight to his private residence on Columbia Road to rest, and then went out to visit Zhongwei Wang Chonghui, returning only at noon. Sun plans to stay in Shanghai for a day or two before returning to Nanjing to preside over the Legislative Yuan meeting scheduled for this Friday. According to Sun, he is not familiar with the recent situation in Guangxi Province. However, given the national crisis, he sincerely hopes that Li, Bai, and others will understand soon to achieve the path of peaceful reunification. Banditry along the borders clearly has a background, but local authorities are taking strict precautions, so there should be no problem. Regarding the issue of amnesty for political prisoners, central colleagues have expressed their support. The specific measures are still under discussion. The cancellation of the arrest warrants for Li Jishen and Chen Mingshu can be announced in the coming days. The election of National Assembly representatives is actively underway, and the Assembly can definitely be convened as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Today All Day: Citizens Supplement Citizen Registration Completed in 21 locations in one day Farmers' associations and trade unions schedule the election of candidates</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: The supplementary citizen registration for all citizens will be conducted by the National Election Office from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. today throughout the city, at 21 locations throughout the city. The locations of the supplementary registration offices were noted in yesterday's newspaper. It is expected that a large number of people will go to register nearby today.</p>
<p>Meaning of Registration Oath</p>
<p>A reporter visited the person in charge of the National Election Office yesterday. According to him, citizen registration and oath-taking are necessary procedures to implement the Prime Minister's teachings before the completion of tutelage and the beginning of constitutionalism. The meaning is to enable citizens with legal qualifications to sincerely swear an oath to support the Republic of China, implement the Three Principles of the People, and adopt the Five-Power Constitution so that when constitutionalism begins, they can be entrusted with political power and use it well. Civilized and law-abiding countries in the world all regard oath-taking as the foundation of the rule of law. Therefore, citizens who naturalize into a country must take an oath to show their sincerity, respect their national system, abide by their constitution, and strive for their obligations, and then they can be recognized as citizens. Otherwise, even if they live in the country for their entire lives, they will still be regarded as foreigners and will not be able to enjoy the rights of citizens. Therefore, unless one doubts the Republic of China or does not believe in the Republic of China, one should participate in citizen registration and oath-taking to obtain citizenship, and then one can exercise the four political powers of election, recall, initiative, and referendum and enjoy the civil rights granted by the state. However, oath-taking must begin with rectifying one's heart and having sincere intentions, and then self-cultivation and managing the state can be achieved. If one is hypocritical and perfunctory, it will not only desecrate the sanctity of the oath but also invite self-destruction. Yuan Shikai in the early Republic and Chen Jiongming in the third year of the Republic are examples of this. I hope those who perform citizen registration and oath-taking will not be negligent.</p>
<p>Seven Points to Note for Registration</p>
<p>He then said that the purpose of the supplementary citizen registration tomorrow (that is, today) is to remedy the citizens who missed the last registration, and the method is more thorough. All citizens in the city who have not yet registered should know that civil rights cannot be abandoned and should immediately go to the nearest registration office to obtain and fill out a registration form in order to wait for the summons to take the oath. However, there are several points to note: (1) Citizen registration and oath-taking are performed only once per person, so those who have already registered at their service unit, school, or organization do not need to fill out another form. (2) All those who are 20 years old or older and have resided in the city for more than one year, and who do not have any of the circumstances listed in Article 3 of the Registration Rules (such as betraying the National Government, corruption in public service, deprivation of civil rights, mental illness, opium addiction, or being under guardianship), should be registered as citizens, regardless of gender, wealth, or status. (3) In the "membership in occupational organization" column of the registration form, if you joined an organization before May 14th of this year (that is, the date the Election Law was promulgated), you should specify "Farmers' Association," "Trade Union," "Chamber of Commerce," or "Education Association," etc. Otherwise, write "None." (4) If a woman does not have a name, she should indicate "Mother/Wife/Sister/ Younger Sister of So-and-so" on the form for identification. (5) You should note your address on the registration form so that it can be investigated if necessary. (6) The registration form must be filled out by the person on the spot and returned to the registration office. The other copy of the oath can be taken back and submitted after the summons to take the oath, in exchange for a citizen certificate. (7) If you filled out a form last time but did not return it, you should take the opportunity to return it to the nearest registration office as soon as possible. I hope all citizens will pay attention to the above seven points.</p>
<p>Organizations Begin to Elect</p>
<p>According to the procedures for handling elections, the representatives of various occupational organizations should begin to elect their candidates immediately. The office has set the 27th of this month as the date for the election of candidates for the Farmers' Association (including the Fishermen's Association), with the location at the Municipal Farmers' Association. The 29th is the date for the election of candidates for the Trade Union, with the location at the General Trade Union. Notice has been given to the executive organ officials of each lowest-level organization of the relevant associations stipulated by the Election Law to attend the election at the appointed time.</p>
<p>Organizational Members Swear Oath</p>
<p>The National Election Office has also set the 27th of this month for all Trade Union members to take the citizen oath, and the 29th for Farmers' Association (including Fishermen's Association) members to take the citizen oath, with the location at each lower-level Farmers' Association and Trade Union. (The date for members of the same trade association to take the oath is still being determined.) The Farmers' Association and Trade Union have been notified so that they can participate in the election of official representatives in the future.</p>
<p>Election Laws Reprinted</p>
<p>The Municipal National Election Office previously printed a small booklet of the National Assembly Representatives Election Law and Implementing Rules promulgated by the National Government to meet the needs of all sectors. Within just over ten days, it was completely distributed. Therefore, it has been reprinted a few days ago, and the legal provisions have been carefully proofread. The interpretations of the General Office have also been compiled and included as much as possible for reference. It was published yesterday. However, not many copies have been printed. Therefore, all units, schools, and organizations that need it must send a letter with postage attached to the office to request it, and then it will be mailed accordingly.</p>

He plans to visit Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, today and take the night express train to Nanjing at 11 PM to report everything to Foreign Minister Zhang.</p>
<p>Three-Month Leave, Intends to Extend</p>
<p>Mr. He met with a reporter from the New Voice Society at his residence at 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon and made a statement. He began by saying that he had been serving as minister to Turkey for a year and a half and was not familiar with the situation in China. He wanted to learn about recent developments, such as the recent disturbances in Guangdong and Guangxi and various changes in the country. Therefore, he requested leave to return home for inspection, and also to attend the National Assembly, which is about to convene (Note: Mr. He is a member of the Central Committee and a natural representative), and to take care of personal matters. The original leave was for three months, but due to delays en route, he will need to extend it. He departed Turkey on the 15th of last month, traveled via Italy, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the United States, and met with Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji. He heard that Shi Zhaoji was also planning to return home and be replaced by Wang Zhengting, but he did not discuss this. He stayed in New York for ten days, changed ships to cross the Pacific Ocean, and stopped in Japan, where he met with Ambassador to Japan, Xu Shiying, before returning home on the same ship.</p>
<p>Turkey Expresses Great Sympathy for China</p>
<p>He continued, stating that Turkish President Kemal Pasha and the general Korean population deeply sympathize with China's current situation. Before World War I, Turkey, like China, rose up as a new nation through national effort. Turkey has a history of thousands of years and is now seeking to promote its ancient culture. Tracing its origins to the Uyghur Turks, the authorities are encouraging scholars and professors to actively research Chinese culture, eliminating Arabian and Persian influences.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Affairs and Trade Situation</p>
<p>Mr. He continued, stating that Turkish diplomacy is well-managed. Ten years ago, Turkey established friendly relations with the Soviet Union. Recently, Great Britain also made peace with Turkey, and therefore, the issue of the straits, which Turkey considers crucial, was resolved. As for the country's trade, the situation is unique, adopting a "reciprocity system," that is, a controlled nature. Any country trading with Turkey, any country that exports goods to Turkey must import Turkish goods of equal value, with the aim of offsetting and preventing the outflow of cash.</p>
<p>Sino-Turkish Trade Agreement Under Negotiation</p>
<p>Mr. He then answered the reporter's questions, stating that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed Minister to Switzerland, Hu Shize, to conduct negotiations in Geneva regarding the drafting of a Sino-Turkish trade agreement. While he was in Turkey, he also discussed it with the Turkish authorities. However, because Turkey's foreign trade adopts a "reciprocity system," China must first have an organization internally. Therefore, although there have been negotiations, there has been no decision. During this trip back to China, he will discuss this matter in detail with the government authorities, especially the Ministry of Industry. Currently, China has no commercial presence in Turkey, and there are very few overseas Chinese. Therefore, in addition to a Sino-Turkish trade agreement, a residency treaty must also be concluded, allowing citizens of both countries to freely reside in each other's countries. However, this matter has not received formal instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must be requested and decided upon during this trip back to China before proceeding.</p>
<p>Denies the Closure of the Turkish Embassy</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about rumors of the closure of the embassy in Turkey and his (referring to Mr. He) assignment to a position in China, Mr. He replied that these rumors are absolutely untrue. Turkey has also decided to send an ambassador to China. Fude Pei was previously appointed, but the plan was delayed due to budget issues. It was not until July of this year that it was approved by the cabinet. The candidate must be reappointed. He deeply feels that diplomatic affairs must be handled by specialized personnel, and he fears that he is not competent enough. After he returns to China, the embassy affairs will be temporarily handled by Counselor Xiao Jirong.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Warning</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Observatory at 9 PM last night, the Zikawei Observatory issued a gale warning at 9 PM last night, stating that at 6 PM, a gale was located between 25.30 degrees north latitude and 126 degrees east longitude, with the center experiencing violent winds within 60 miles. It is moving northwest-west. The Central News Agency reported from Nanjing on the 25th that the hurricane approaching the south of Daito Island, according to the Central Meteorological Observatory, reached between Naba and Isisakyina Islands on the afternoon of the 25th, with strong winds moving northwest-west at a speed of 20 kilometers. Strong winds and rain have already occurred in the East China Sea and may approach the coastal areas of Wenzhou, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and northern Fujian within 24 hours, with winds intensifying.</p>
<h3>Manchurian and Mongolian Woolen Fabrics Dumped in Shanghai, Taxed Only as Re-exported Domestic Goods, Half the Price of Imported Goods</h3>
<p>The New News Agency reports that as the weather turns cooler, woolen fabrics are about to enter the market. It is reported that recently, a large batch of ABC serge woolen fabrics from the three northeastern provinces has arrived in Shanghai. The customs authorities call these woolen fabrics "Manchurian and Mongolian goods." They are originally produced in Shenyang and are taxed at only 7.5% as re-exported domestic goods, while imported woolen fabrics are taxed at over 55%, a significant difference. As a result, some people are even shipping Japanese woolen fabrics to the three northeastern provinces for repackaging before shipping them to Shanghai. It is reported that Ren Chang Woolen Fabrics has ordered more than 100 boxes from Yijing Foreign Firm, while Iwai and Abe City Foreign Firms have each ordered 60 boxes, with a value of over 200,000 taels.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Huang Fu, former Minister of the Interior, went to Mogan Mountain for convalescence. As the weather in Shanghai gradually cools, he descended the mountain and went to Hangzhou the morning before last.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Notifies All Industries to Conduct Periodic Inventory Checks and Complete Registration Within One Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified 24 trade associations in the city, including the silk and satin industry, paper industry, sugar industry, machine dyeing and weaving industry, southern goods industry, knitting industry, hardware industry, and cosmetics industry. The notification stated, "It has been decided that Article 2 of the Inspection Regulations of the Inspection Committee of this chamber stipulates that each industry inspection sub-committee should conduct inventory registration, create a roster to be kept by the chamber, and report to the chamber for record-keeping. Furthermore, Article 6 stipulates that this chamber may conduct random or sample inspections of the goods, raw materials, and accounting records of various businesses and factories at any time. The date of commencement of the inspection has now been resolved by the 6th Standing Committee Meeting of the Inspection Committee to be September 1st, when customs officials will conduct sample inspections of various industries. Each industry inspection sub-committee should complete the inventory registration within this month. This notification is hereby recorded and issued. It is hoped that your association will promptly instruct its members and non-members to report their inventory and imports for registration in accordance with the inspection regulations and report their shipments for verification. The association should create a roster and report it to this chamber for verification. This is of utmost importance." He then transferred to a car and followed the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, arriving at his private residence on Qizhi Road at around 5 PM that afternoon to rest. As his old illness had not yet healed, he will seek medical treatment in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Huang, due to fatigue, refused to meet with guests except for his close confidants. As for the rumors that Mr. Huang will take up an important position and that he will be going to Guangdong, these have not been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Ling Daoyang Went to Guangdong Yesterday</h3>
<p>Ling Daoyang, the newly appointed Director of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, who was transferred from the Director of the Central Department of Agriculture and Forestry, completed his transfer procedures in Nanjing and arrived in Shanghai on the night express train at 11 PM the night before last. After arriving in Shanghai at around 7 AM yesterday morning, he did not stay and boarded the Dollar Steamship Lines' Coolidge in the afternoon at 1 PM to go to Hong Kong and then Guangdong to take up his new post.</p>

He specially raised the issues of (1) opium among overseas Chinese workers and (2) equal treatment of Chinese workers with international workers, which are currently crucial for China. The first case (opium issue) was jointly proposed with the French labor representative and was passed by the Congress. The second case (equal treatment) was also passed by the Congress, and a committee was formed to draft a convention, which will be formally included in the agenda for discussion at the 22nd Congress in 1938.

Although working hours are reduced, their work efficiency is stronger than that of Chinese workers. The educational level of workers is generally seven to nine years of national education. Labor insurance for workers in case of unemployment, accidental death, etc., is very developed. Workers in Italy and Germany have large-scale organizations for sports and entertainment. The government provides workers with various welfare facilities such as travel, which are very complete. After the Congress closed, he visited Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Russia, and other countries to inspect the labor conditions and industries of various countries, each with its own strengths.

<h3>The Ministry of Railways Reorganizes the Debts of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, After Sincere Consultation with Bondholders, The Interest Rate Will Be Reduced to 2.5% Within 20 Years, And 4/5 of the Arrears Will Be Forgiven, The Principal Will Be Repaid Within 50 Years</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway borrowed 1.5 million pounds from a British banking syndicate in the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty. The railway was completed four years later. The main business was passenger transport, and freight transport only accounted for one-tenth. The route was short, and competition from shipping between Hong Kong and Guangdong was fierce. The railway's revenue was insufficient, and the repayment of principal and interest in previous years was subsidized by other railways. It had never been independently financed. Furthermore, the political situation in Guangdong Province was unstable, and no one paid attention to the debt. As a result, the principal and interest have been in arrears since June 1925, accumulating to a huge sum of over 1.55 million pounds. Now that the situation in Guangdong has stabilized, the central government, in order to maintain national credit, is responsible for reorganizing the Guangzhou-Kowloon loan. After sincere consultation with the bondholders, the bondholders were fortunately able to understand the difficult situation and cooperate sincerely. Regarding the interest rate, it will be reduced from 5% to 2.5% within 20 years, and 4/5 of the arrears will be forgiven. The principal will be repaid within 50 years. The Ministry of Railways is deeply grateful for the cooperation of the bondholders and is determined to renovate the railway administration to increase the railway revenue and implement the original intention of maintaining credit. The detailed measures were announced yesterday. The notice issued by the Minister of Railways yesterday regarding the measures to restore the 1905 bonds of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is as follows: (1) From June 1, 1937, the bond interest will be paid at 2.5% per year for the first 20 years, and 5% will be paid thereafter. However, if the net revenue of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway exceeds 200,000 yuan in national currency in any year within the first 20 years, the excess amount should be used to increase the interest payment first, up to a maximum of 5%, and the remaining amount should be used to increase the principal repayment; (2) From June 1, 1936, 550,000 yuan in national currency will be prepared annually as a reserve fund for the repayment of principal and interest. Of this amount, 350,000 yuan will be allocated by the Ministry of Railways from its funds, and the remaining 200,000 yuan will be allocated by the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau. From June 1941, the Ministry of Railways will allocate an additional 250,000 yuan for principal repayment, increasing the total reserve fund to 800,000 yuan; (3) From June 1, 1937, the balance of the reserve fund, after deducting the interest payment, will be used for principal repayment. The principal of this loan shall be fully repaid within a maximum of 50 years; (4) 4/5 of the arrears will be canceled, and the remainder will be exchanged for non-interest-bearing small notes. The small notes will be repaid after the principal has been repaid. Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways stated that for the benefit of the Chinese government and the bondholders, he has already begun to improve the condition of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and its management methods.</p>
<h3>Tang Liangli, Who Went Abroad with Wang Jingwei, Returns to Shanghai, Talking About Wang Still in the Czech Republic, Bullet Not Yet Removed, In Good Spirits, Expected to Return Home in Four or Five Months</h3>
<p>The New Voice Society reports that Tang Liangli, a senior advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the editor of the English-language Public Forum, who went abroad with Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, with the title of minister, was assigned to international propaganda and to inspect the press industries of various countries. Now that his mission is complete, he passed through the United States and arrived in Shanghai on the Dollar Steamship Lines' Coolidge the day before yesterday. A reporter from the New Voice Society visited him yesterday. According to him, he has traveled to Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy, Switzerland, the United States, and other countries, meeting with propaganda officials and authoritative journalists in those countries, such as German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels. All the details of the experience cannot be disclosed before reporting to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regarding Mr. Wang's recent situation, he left Europe two months ago, spent one month in the United States, and another month traveling from the United States back to China, so he does not know the details. However, he knows that Mr. Wang is still near Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, in a place near Bukolas. He is in good spirits and has been discharged from the hospital. However, because the bullet in his back has not yet been removed, it is expected that it will take another four or five months before he can return to China. Mr. Tang is scheduled to go to Nanjing in the next day or two to report to the ministry.</p>
<h3>Freight Rates for Goods to the United States Will Increase Starting in September, Average Increase of 20%, Only Lake Silk Will Remain at the Old Rate</h3>
<p>Since all shipping companies on the Pacific route have joined the Freight Conference, the freight rates for goods shipped from Shanghai to the United States (Honolulu, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Victoria, Tacoma, Seattle, and Portland) will be increased by the twelve shipping companies of the conference, including American Mail, Changxing, Dollar, Kawasaki, International, American President Lines (New York Line), NYK, Osaka, Pacific, and Yamashita Kisen. For goods shipped from the Yangtze River, Ningbo, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Niuzhuang and exported from Shanghai, the freight rate, whether it is 40 cubic feet per ton or 2,000 pounds per ton, will be increased by an average of 20% from September 1, according to the original No. 6 "Delive." For example, the freight rate for mineral sand will increase from 8 yuan per ton to 10 yuan, the freight rate for soybeans (packaged) will increase from 7 yuan per ton to 8.5 yuan, the freight rate for porcelain will increase from 12 yuan per ton to 14 yuan, and the freight rate for tea will increase from 5 yuan per ton to 6 yuan. However, the freight rate for Lake silk will remain unchanged. The above freight rates are calculated in US dollars. The shipping companies have already notified the customers of the price increase.</p>

<h3>National Postal Workers' General Union Continues to Strive for Participation in the National Election</h3>
<p>The National Postal Workers' General Union is the general organization of postal worker groups in various regions and the highest leadership of postal employees nationwide. Its mission is to assist the authorities in developing postal services, improving the lives of workers, and enhancing mutual aid. It is also very active in patriotic actions and social undertakings. The organization is well-structured and firmly united, holding a significant position among workers' groups. In May of this year, the central government announced the National Assembly Representative Election Law, which did not include provisions for postal worker groups to elect representatives. The union, considering this a matter of postal workers' rights and interests, immediately submitted three proposals to the central government and the National Government for adoption. These proposals generally requested: (1) recognition of postal workers' right to participate in elections in the name of their group; (2) the formation of a separate electoral unit for postal workers to directly elect representatives; and (3) the allocation of representative quotas according to population proportions. Details were published in various newspapers at the time and will not be repeated here. The union, noting that special industry unions such as those for telegraph, railway, and maritime workers faced similar situations, jointly petitioned the central government in Beijing, striving for a unified solution. Subsequently, the railway and maritime unions were granted special permission by the central government to designate representatives within their local representative quotas. However, postal and telegraph representatives remained unassigned. Postal employees nationwide were quite perplexed by this decision and have repeatedly petitioned the union to firmly continue its efforts. Recently, the National Postal Workers' General Union submitted another petition to the Ministry of Public Training of the Central Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the General Office for the Election of Representatives of the National Assembly, earnestly stating the reasons why postal workers should have the freedom of association and election, and urging them to accept and implement it. The original petition is recorded below: "Upon investigation, postal employees, due to the lack of provisions for representatives of postal worker groups in the National Assembly Representative Election Law, previously petitioned the Central National Government and the Executive and Legislative Yuans to add representative quotas, and jointly appealed with special industry unions such as postal, telegraph, railway, and shipping in Beijing. The responsible personnel of various agencies sympathized and accepted the petition, promising to devise remedial measures. Subsequently, the maritime and railway unions were allowed to designate representatives within their local representative quotas. However, no clear order has been issued for the postal and telegraph unions. Yesterday, we received a letter from the General Office for the Election of Representatives of the National Assembly stating that the National Postal Workers' General Union, the National Postal Workers' General Association, and local workers' unions are not legally founded and are not allowed to participate in the election. Upon reading this, the public was perplexed. In addition to sending a special letter to the General Office for the Election of Representatives of the National Assembly requesting clarification, we hereby respectfully present the reasons why postal personnel should have the freedom of association and election, hoping for your review and approval. Article 14 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the Period of Political Tutelage states that people have the freedom of association and assembly, and shall not be suspended or restricted except in accordance with the law. Although postal personnel are civil servants, they are still citizens and should have no doubt about it. Therefore, they have the freedom to exercise the rights granted by the Provisional Constitution. The phrase "shall not be suspended or restricted except in accordance with the law" refers to situations where the nature of assembly and association endangers public order and morals, or there is a risk of endangering public order and morals, and the state laws have explicit provisions for suspension or restriction. The existing postal personnel organization was established in accordance with the policies of the Chinese Kuomintang, and for more than ten years, it has never deviated from the supervision and guidance of the party. Its purpose is pure and should not be subject to suspension or restriction. Past experience further confirms our confidence, which we believe is already well understood and does not require further elaboration. As for the General Office for the Election of Representatives of the National Assembly's letter stating that it is not legally founded, it must be because the postal worker groups have not been reorganized in accordance with the Postal Workers' Union Organization Regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan of the National Government on October 5, 1932. However, Article 3 of the Trade Union Law states, 'Workers in national administrative, transportation, state-owned industries, educational institutions, public utilities, and various government agencies may use this law to organize trade unions, but their officials, employees, and workers of military and military industrial agencies are not included.' This effectively suspends the right of association for most postal personnel, which is in conflict with the spirit of the party platform and the Provisional Constitution. Moreover, the organizational rules of the postal workers' union</p>
<h3>Statistics on National Textile Mill Cotton Production and Shutdowns in the First Half of the 25th Year</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Cotton Mill Owners Association announced the following statistics on national textile mills for the first half of the 25th year: (1) cotton sales, (2) cotton inventory, and (3) shutdown status. (1) From January 1 to June 30 of this year, textile mills sold 1,155,347 bales of cotton (500 pounds per bale), a decrease of 29,886 bales compared to the second half of last year and a decrease of 17,803 bales compared to the same period last year. Among them, Chinese cotton accounted for 1,072,107 bales, an increase of 9,938 bales compared to the second half of last year and an increase of 80,234 bales compared to the first half of last year. American cotton accounted for 38,722 bales, a decrease of 30,724 bales compared to the second half of last year and a decrease of 64,989 bales compared to the first half of last year. Indian cotton accounted for 30,589 bales, a decrease of 8,707 bales compared to the second half of last year and a decrease of 25,816 bales compared to the first half of last year. Egyptian cotton accounted for 12,650 bales, an increase of 364 bales compared to the second half of last year and a decrease of 534 bales compared to the first half of last year. Other types of cotton accounted for 1,279 bales, also a decrease compared to last year. This is mainly due to exchange rate issues, which have made foreign cotton more expensive when converted, and heavy import taxes. Therefore, textile mills have gradually reduced their use of foreign cotton. (2) As of July 1, textile mills had an inventory of 392,127 bales of cotton, an increase of 33,251 bales compared to the second half of last year and an increase of 76,155 bales compared to the same period last year. Among them, the inventory of American and Chinese cotton was roughly similar to the second half of last year, but the inventory of Indian cotton increased by 19,390 bales. The reason for this is that last year's domestic cotton crop was poor, the supply of coarse cotton was insufficient, and market prices rose. In the spring, Indian cotton prices fell sharply, so some was imported to meet demand. However, most of it arrived in May and June, so the inventory of Indian cotton was higher at the end of June. (3) From January to June, the number of spindles shut down reached 1,555,014, an increase of 194,731 compared to the second half of last year. However, the average shutdown time decreased slightly. If calculated based on the total number of spindles nationwide, the number of weeks of shutdown was 5.06 weeks, similar to the second half of last year, but an increase of 1.34 weeks compared to the first half of last year. The increase in the shutdown rate indicates that the textile industry is still in a very difficult situation. Furthermore, it is based on this unsound trade union law that is being formulated, resulting in numerous flaws and even greater fragmentation. For example, it forcefully divides postal clerks and postal assistants into officials and workers. For postal employees with equal duties and the same appointments, one is considered ineligible to form a trade union, while the other is considered eligible. This is inconsistency number one. Furthermore, the law stipulates that the organizational members of postal workers' unions are limited to postal assistants, postal carriers, and mail carriers. However, the existing postal workers' associations and postal workers' unions actually include postal clerks. This type of organization has been the case from the beginning and cannot be easily changed. National legislation should be based on the social background, because the social background has the power to influence the law, and the law cannot change society. Moreover, in recent legislative practices in various countries, the right of association for civil servants is recognized. For example, the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912 in the United States, the labor law and draft new constitution of Soviet Russia, the German federal constitution, and the constitution of the Free City of Danzig all clearly stipulate that civil servants have the freedom of association. Our country's legislation has always been known for adopting the latest legislative examples, but it has disregarded the right of association for civil servants, which not only has the suspicion of obliterating facts but also misses the opportunity to take advantage of the situation. This is inconsistency number two. In summary, the organization of postal personnel has historical and social roots. The reason why it cannot be reorganized according to law is due to the inadequacy of the law, not the postal personnel's disregard for laws and regulations. We believe that the right to vote is the most important of the four rights and is a stepping stone to implementing constitutional government, which is of great importance. All citizens have the right to exercise it according to law, and postal personnel, as citizens, are no exception. Moreover, they are numerous and spread throughout the country, and their profession is a unified national transportation and political necessity. Therefore, postal personnel are particularly important to the election administration. Now that the election of representatives to the National Assembly is about to begin, the organizational issues have suddenly forced postal personnel to be unable to participate in the election in the name of their group. Not to mention the concern of postal personnel for national affairs, even those who bear the heavy responsibility of the party and the country will not know how to explain themselves. The timing is urgent. For the sake of their own rights and interests and for the sake of the constitutional government, postal personnel have no choice but to implore the Central National Government to adopt the legislative precedents of various countries, as well as the spirit of the country's provisional constitution and party platform, and to re-examine and revise the existing trade union law and the postal workers' union organization regulations, so that postal worker groups have a legal basis and the central government can fulfill its leadership responsibilities. Before the aforementioned laws and regulations can be revised, in order to enable postal worker groups to participate in the election of national representatives, please immediately devise remedial measures, allow participation in trade union elections, and avoid any shortcomings in the constitutional project. This is a pressing request, and we sincerely hope that you will review and promptly handle it, and we will be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>General Association for the Suppression of Smuggling Hires Instructors for Each Province and City to Strengthen Local Anti-Smuggling Organizations</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the National General Association for the Suppression of Smuggling has attached great importance to the organization of anti-smuggling committees in various provinces and counties. In addition to stipulating general organizational rules and work guidelines, in order to strengthen local organizations, the second standing committee meeting resolved to hire instructors for anti-smuggling associations in various regions. In addition to the association's members, who are all naturally instructors, all representatives of chambers of commerce from various provinces, cities, and counties who had attended previous joint meetings were also hired as instructors. The full list of instructors is recorded below: Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Xu Jiguang, Jin Runxiang, Ke Ganchen, Luo Qinghua, Ge Jiecen, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Zishi, Liang Rentong, Wan Zhucun, Tao Yutang, Huang Xiren, Zai Yungu, Yuan Ruifu, Gu Suming, Xu Xinggong, Yu Xiaochuan, Cheng Ganqing, Wang Jingting, Xu Guosen, Liu Yangshan, Liu Wenting, Wang Deting, Zi Yushi, Luo Huizong, Yu Rongqiao, Gao Bochang, Duan Jingshen, Zhu Yaoting, Zheng Longwen, Jia Shaowu, Liang Shuxuan, Cai Chang, Chen Xinyan, Zhang Shuliang, Yuan Yousheng, Cheng Qianyuan, Yao Zilun, Lin Chuanshen, Luo Yuming.</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Donate Funds to Purchase Aircraft</h3>
<p>The China Aviation Association's expanded national aviation salvation movement held a campaign to purchase aircraft as a birthday celebration for Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's 50th birthday. The fundraising in this city has been enthusiastically supported by all sectors, with remarkable results. In addition to donations from various groups and individuals, various entertainment venues have also held events for a day, with all ticket revenue going to birthday donations. Details of this have been reported in various newspapers. It is now known that the Cadre Road Cadre Grand Theater will donate all of its revenue today to the fundraising effort. In addition, the Carpet Industry Association donated 188 yuan, the entire staff of the Maya Silk Weaving Factory donated 1,243 yuan and 44 cents, the China Printing Factory donated 23 yuan, the Xin Ting Construction Factory donated 1,000 yuan, the Shanghai Municipal National Arts Hall donated 32 yuan and 70 cents, and Xiang Jiping submitted 100 yuan raised by Chen Heling, 100 yuan by Xia Yansheng, and a total of 164 yuan by Ni Simin and 26 others.</p>
<h3>Rice and Wheat Prices Are Low; Domestic Rice Can Be Shipped to Guangdong</h3>
<p>This year, most parts of our country have reported good harvests, but due to Japanese merchants buying up rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in large quantities, prices have soared. Although the authorities have imposed restrictions, the rising trend is still difficult to curb. According to sources in the grain trade, Japanese merchants have recently stopped buying in the north, and manufacturers have also shown little interest due to the high price of wheat, so wheat prices have suddenly fallen. As for rice prices, they are also trending lower as new crops enter the market. It is also understood that after the Guangdong incident is resolved, the import of foreign rice will be handled according to import tariffs, so the import of foreign rice into Guangdong will likely decrease, and domestic rice can be shipped to Guangdong for sale.</p>
<h3>National Election Representatives from the Legal Profession to Be Allocated Among Three Regions</h3>
<p>The Lawyers Association of the Republic of China held its second executive committee meeting in Qingdao. In addition to the attending executive committee members, there were also more than 50 people, including the association's secretary-general, various secretaries, and the various secretaries of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee, to discuss various cases. In addition to matters related to judicial reform, the most important issue was the election of representatives to the National Assembly. Because there are more than 80 lawyers' associations across the country, and the quota for representatives to the National Assembly is only set at ten, it is difficult to allocate the seats due to the limited number of seats and the large number of applicants. The attending committee members took this opportunity to exchange views and reached a satisfactory result. The pre-determined allocation of representative quotas will be divided into three regions: (1) South China Region, including the lawyer's associations of the capital, Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou, the region with the most members, is allocated seven seats; (2) North China Region, including the lawyer's associations of Beijing, Tianjin, Shandong, etc., the region with the second largest number of members, is allocated five seats; (3) Central China Region, including the lawyer's associations of Sichuan, Hankou, Jiangxi, and other provinces, because they have the fewest members, voluntarily withdrew. Among the above-mentioned twelve people, ten representatives from the legal profession will be elected in the final election.</p>
<h3>Intestine Industry Association Petitions Ministry of Finance to Stop Two Factories from Taking Advantage</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Intestine Industry Association previously submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating: "This is a petition for the matter. It is stated in the letter from the association's member, China Intestine Factory, etc., that a non-member fellow trader, Chengda Intestine Factory (factory address is on Deswei Road, Hongkou, Shanghai; manager is Cheng Zhongxin), has been manufacturing pig intestines for export for many years. Suddenly, in February of last year, they came up with a novel idea: they concentrated the pig intestines from various ports in Shanghai and transported them to Zhoushan, Zhejiang, to set up a factory for manufacturing. After the work was completed, they transported them back to Shanghai. Upon investigation, Zhoushan is a salt production area, where salt is only worth about two yuan per dan. Now, in Shanghai, it is ten yuan and six jiao per dan per hundred market catties, more than five times the price of salt in Zhoushan. This is why they took this action. Upon investigation, the manufacture of pig intestines requires about 400 catties of salt per barrel. Assuming one barrel per day, the advantage they are taking is considerable. Then, in March of this year, another non-member, Hanli Intestine Factory (factory address is on Beijing Jiang Road, Zha Bei, Shanghai; manager is Wu Lihou), also set up a branch factory in Zhoushan and intensified their actions, smuggling private salt into Shanghai. The salt can then be used to make pig intestines in their Shanghai factory. The extent of taking advantage of the law and the scope is more than ten times that of Chengda Factory. Since Hanli Factory has such illegitimate benefits, their costs must be reduced. Therefore, their sales are successful, and fellow traders are harmed. As a result, 70-80% of them have stopped production. Those who plan to follow suit and move to Zhoushan to set up factories are endless. Hanli Factory only cares about its own selfishness and does not consider the national tax revenue. Members, etc., cannot bear the long-term harm to national tax revenue and the interests of fellow traders, so they specifically ask your association to forward this to the competent authorities to find ways to stop it in order to protect the safety of fellow traders, etc., to the association. Based on this, the state's tax revenue, especially salt, is very important. The Hanli Chengda factories are taking advantage and daring to use the transportation of goods to leak private salt. Shanghai is not the only industry that needs salt to manufacture goods. If various soy sauce gardens, etc., follow suit, what will the future of national tax revenue be? If those who use salt to make goods nationwide follow suit and move to salt-producing areas, the national tax revenue will be unimaginable. The association has sent personnel to investigate and confirm that this is the case. It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it to the department to quickly stop it in order to deter others, which is in the public interest. Sincerely submitted."</p>
<h3>Zhou Shouyu Arrives in Shanghai After Inspecting the Americas</h3>
<p>Zhou Shouyu, chairman of the Guangzhou Universal Daily, who was sent to the Americas by the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Provincial Federation of Journalists to inspect commerce and journalism, returned to the country on the President Coolidge steamer the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai. A reporter from the Industrial News Agency interviewed Zhou at his residence yesterday. According to Zhou himself, this trip took 16 months, traveling through Hawaii and various parts of North America, a total of 26 provinces and 60 cities, visiting 24 Western chambers of commerce, 23 Western newspapers, 10 Chinese newspapers, and 5 Chinese chambers of commerce. He gained quite a lot in terms of liaison between Chinese and Westerners, inspection of overseas Chinese affairs and party affairs, and research on commerce and journalism. Unfortunately, because he stayed in the United States for a long time, he received repeated urges from Guangzhou to return to the country, so he was unable to visit Europe as he wished. Upon returning this time, he plans to rest in Shanghai for a few days, then go to Beijing, and then return to Guangdong to report back. Before September 20, he will rush to Shanghai to welcome Zhou Song, a giant of overseas Chinese in the Americas, to travel around the country together.</p>
<h3>Ronin Smuggles Drugs from Xiamen to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, smuggling has reached a saturation point recently. After some restraint, ronin are again secretly transporting large quantities of highly potent drugs such as morphine, heroin, white powder, and red pills to Shanghai for sale. It is reported that most of the drugs are transported from Xiamen, where the ronin have a large-scale drug manufacturing organization with a capital of 1.5 million yuan. Their drugs are not only sold in Shanghai, but also spread to various ports in Southeast China. Their biggest goal is to undermine our country's thorough anti-drug policy, hoping to poison the entire country.</p>
<h3>Huang Huannan's Funeral to Be Held Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Cotton Mill and Bank Jointly Form Cotton Purchasing Syndicate to Start Purchasing Cotton in the Interior</h3>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, our country's new cotton will be available in ten days, so Shanghai cotton mills are actively cooperating with banks to form cotton purchasing syndicates to purchase cotton in the interior. It is reported that the New Textile Factory and the China Farmers' Bank, Shanghai Bank, etc., have jointly formed a cotton purchasing syndicate, which is already ready and has begun to contact cotton merchants in the interior to purchase cotton. However, because the syndicate believes that current cotton prices are still unstable, it does not want to purchase in large quantities and only aims to buy and process as needed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo's Exotic Animals Attract More Visitors</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road purchased two elephants and two tigers from overseas at the beginning of the month and made them available for public viewing, the number of visitors to the zoo has increased daily. Recently, it has also acquired multiple wolverines. A citizen (who did not want to leave their name) also donated a very large, dark green exotic doll, which has caused a sensation in society. Therefore, the number of visitors to the zoo in recent days has exceeded 3,000 per day. According to Director Shen of the zoo, the zoo is located in a densely populated area, and the land prices nearby are expensive, so it is difficult to develop and expand. Moreover, the living conditions for wild animals are not very suitable, so the zoo has plans to move to a better location.</p>

<h3>Lu Shouzhi and Gao Jinfu, Master and Apprentice Vendetta: Gang Entices Victim Out and Attacks with Axes, Causing Injury; Encounter with Law Enforcement While Seeking Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>Gao Jinfu, a 31-year-old carpenter from Yixing, residing at No. 220, Jumen Road, Nanshi, was introduced to Lu Shouzhi (a 30-year-old Wuxi native residing at No. 1, Changkang Lane, Muqiao Road, inside Fangbang Bridge, Ximen) as his master last August. Later, because Gao did not treat him as a master, Lu harbored resentment. At 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, he instructed his other apprentice, Lu Xingfu, who also works as a carpenter, to tell Gao that there was business to be done, enticing him to the vicinity of the Houhui Hall Lane, Sanguantang, Xieshi Bridge. Suddenly, six or seven thugs jumped out, led by his master, Lu Shouzhi. Each held iron rods and sharp axes, attacking Gao. As a result, Gao was slashed in the right foot, fracturing the bone, once on the left foot, and on the face, right chest, left finger, etc., causing blood to flow all over the ground. The thugs, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled without a trace. Fortunately, Gao was strong and robust, so he hailed a car and went to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. After bandaging, because the injuries were not too serious, he took a car home yesterday. While passing the intersection of Tangjiawan and Xilin Road, he happened to run into his master, Lu, the main offender. Fate had brought them together, so he called the police and had Lu arrested and taken to the Ximen Public Security Bureau for questioning. The accomplice was arrested and investigated.</p>

<h3>Chen Huizhang Case: Private Settlement of a Life; Family Sues Xu Jieli and Others; Xu and Others Are All Staff Members of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association; The Corpse's Wife Recounts the Events Before and After Receiving Compensation – Westerner Massey Must Be Summoned for Further Interrogation –</h3>
<p>Rickshaw puller Chen Huizhang was beaten to death by three British sailors in front of the British Sailors' Home on Maybach Road on the morning of July 8th of this year, leading to the organization of a support association for the tragic case by various circles. The matter was resolved with a price of 600 yuan, with the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association taking charge. Now, the corpse's father, Chen Xizhu, the corpse's wife, Chen Zangshi, and others, have sued Xu Jieli, the executive of the West District branch of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, as well as Zhang Dengying, an executive of the General Association, and Cao Ada, Zhang Jiande, and others in the local court for fraudulently obtaining money through the corpse and coercing them to bury their grievances. They stated that Xu Jieli, under the instructions of Zhang Dengying, acted to</p>
<p>Privately Settle a Life</p>
<p>Because Zhang and others were bribed by the association's leader, the Englishman Massey, to facilitate the release of the perpetrators from criminal punishment. They deceitfully told Zangshi that a great philanthropist from a foreign church, seeing the tragic death of Huizhang and the helplessness of the widow, had asked them to plead their case so that they could receive 600 yuan to maintain their livelihood. On July 23rd, they used deceptive means, falsely claiming to accompany her to collect the money. At the same time, they colluded with Cao Ada, who falsely claimed to be Zangshi's brother, Zang Zhiqin, and Zhang Jiande even</p>
<p>Threatened From the Side</p>
<p>So that they could go together. Upon arrival at the destination, Xu Jieli and others revealed their true, hideous faces and implemented various illegal methods to restrict Zangshi's freedom. They then forced her to put her fingerprint on a blank piece of paper, and Cao Ada, impersonating Zang Zhiqin, signed and received the money on the paper. Upon leaving the gate, they were further deducted 200 yuan, actually receiving 400 yuan. Since then, the defendants have fabricated various threatening words, claiming that Huizhang's death case had been concluded without incident because Zangshi had received the money. If they lingered any longer, they would suffer unexpected disasters, coercing them to leave Shanghai,</p>
<p>Hoping to Erase Traces</p>
<p>Their conscience lost, they acted as accomplices, regarding the lives of their compatriots as if they were weeds, and treating international status as if it were a mere hat. Therefore, in addition to painfully recounting the whole story and suing Massey in the British court, they requested that Xu Jieli, Zhang Dengying, Cao Ada, and Zhang Jiande be brought to justice, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Peiming opened the 12th court to hear the case. Chen Xizhu testified: 68 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 88 Zhen'an Lane, Hengfeng Road, suing Xu Jieli, Zhang Dengying, Cao Ada, and Zhang Jiande because my son was beaten to death by British sailors, and they privately settled the life. The four of them said they would</p>
<p>Give My Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>Several hundred yuan, telling us not to sue. My daughter-in-law did not agree to a settlement. At this point, Chen Zangshi testified: 36 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 20 Jinde Lane, Hengfeng Road. Xu Jieli took me to Zhang Dengying's house. The two of them took me to a foreigner's place. The foreigner gave me 600 yuan. I received 400 yuan, and the other 200 yuan was said to be for their transportation fees. I first gave my fingerprint at the foreigner's place before handing it over. Afterwards, they told me to go back to my hometown, saying that the matter had been settled. I initially did not want to give</p>
<p>My Forced</p>
<p>Cao Ada and Zhang Jiande were called by Xu Jieli to go with me. At this point, Xu Jieli testified: 32 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 8 Hexiu Lane, Machen Road, working as an executive at the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association. What they are saying is completely untrue. After Chen Huizhang was beaten and injured at the time, he was sent to Renji Hospital. Because I was an executive in the association, I went to offer my condolences. Afterwards, Chen Zangshi came to me, asking for my help. Because she was a woman, I told her to ask a man to come. She then asked her brother, Zang Ziqing, whose real name is Cao Ada, to come with her. I told them to write a letter of authorization, so I went to the police station</p>
<p>To Negotiate</p>
<p>Because it couldn't be done, I asked Zhang Dengji at the General Association. Zhang said this matter couldn't be done and that a group had to be asked to help. Later, they said that regardless, they wanted me to help with this matter. They told me to take them to the British man Massey, the director of the Vehicle Department of the Public Works Department. At that time, Massey took them to the police station and gave them 600 yuan, which was the end of it. The receipt was written by the police station and there was no forced fingerprinting. It was explained at the time that the settlement was for the condolence portion, not the criminal portion, etc. At this point, Zhang Dengying testified: 48 years old, from Jiangning, residing at No. 26 Minghua Lane, Tiantong'an Road. When Xu Jieli brought them to ask for my help, I said that I would</p>
<p>Consult With a Legal Advisor</p>
<p>Before proceeding. Later, after studying the matter, it could not be done. On one hand, I comforted them, saying that within the possible range, I would do my best to help. Afterwards, they went to Xu Jieli again to find Massey, etc. I didn't know anything about everything. They came to tell me, and there was a background behind it. At this point, the judge asked Zhang Jiande to testify: 33 years old, from Yancheng, residing at No. 99 Nanxing Lane, Hengfeng Road. I make a living pulling a rickshaw, so I am also</p>
<p>In the Mutual Aid Association</p>
<p>I have been to Massey's place, but I have not been to the police station. The judge asked Chen Zangshi: Was the money handed over at the police station? She replied: It was the foreigner who gave it to Xu Jieli, who then gave it to her. Cao Ada testified: 37 years old, from Funing, residing at No. 30 Jinde Lane, Hengfeng Road. Chen Zangshi asked me to come out to the police station to get the money. Because Xu Jieli said that a relative had to be responsible, I pretended to be her brother and did not divide a single penny. At this point, the judge ordered that the case be postponed to summon Massey to court for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>British Cruiser: A Deserter Captured: Remains Hidden in Shanghai After Desertion for Sixteen Months</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that on April 14th of last year, a common sailor named Harris, only 20 years old, deserted from the British cruiser HMS Suffolk, which was docked in the Huangpu River. Despite extensive searches by the British naval authorities, his whereabouts were unknown. After deserting, the sailor used the alias Wei Bai and remained in Shanghai. In July of this year, probably because he was tired of the life of hiding and regretting his past mistakes, he wrote to the British Admiralty, appealing for forgiveness. In his letter, he indicated a Shanghai address where a reply could be sent and received. Based on this address, the British naval authorities in Shanghai issued an arrest warrant and sent it to the Shanghai Municipal Police. The police dispatched Western detective Bai Latlai to arrest the suspect. Based on the address in the letter, Bai searched in the Hongkou district for a long time and finally arrested the suspect on Monday morning. According to his confession, he deserted from the ship because he was not used to the discipline of the navy. For the past sixteen months, he has been making a living teaching English at a Chinese school in Hongkou and living in that district. The police have now escorted the suspect to the British ship HMS Thistle, which is moored in the Huangpu River, where he is being temporarily detained pending court-martial. It is reported that Harris has served in the navy for four years and is from London, where his mother currently lives.</p>
<h3>Suppression of Extra Tips: Hotel Industry Tests Workers; Association Leaders Discuss Business Conditions</h3>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the hotel industry in this city believes that the New Life Movement's implementation measures to suppress extra tips, stipulating that security deposits for workers are not allowed, replaced by shop guarantees, and that workers' wages should be determined, while tips voluntarily given by customers will be turned over to be used as aviation donations, pose a major threat to the business. It has already submitted a request to the party and government organs, recounting various difficulties and requesting a modification. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited the person in charge of the Hotel Industry Association yesterday and received a detailed account of the current business situation of the hotel industry and the process of testing the opinions of the workers on this case. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Business Conditions</p>
<p>The person in charge stated that the hotel industry's business was still good before the January 28th Incident. Since the post-war destruction of the city, coupled with the frequent disasters in the interior, all industries have felt the economic downturn. With fewer merchants traveling back and forth, the hotel industry has plummeted. Now, more than 600 large and small businesses in the city are all deeply wounded and feel unable to maintain themselves. Although they have lowered prices to attract customers, many rooms are still vacant. If they now follow the regulations of the New Life Movement, they must not only provide security deposits but also suddenly increase wages, then the general trend will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. This is not alarmist; it is a fact that is obvious to all. According to the New Life Movement's regulations, fixed wages will be used and the extra tips will be transferred to aviation donations. The association conducted a test of the absolute majority of the workers, all of whom expressed that they could not agree. This is because the workers can earn 20 or 30 yuan in tips voluntarily given by customers during peak months. If the management is forced to stipulate wages, the standard wages will inevitably be very low and difficult for the workers to accept.</p>
<p>Test Opinions</p>
<p>In order to test the opinions of the workers, the association issued a notice to all businesses a few days ago, stating that in order to suppress extra tips, the New Life Movement Promotion Association first needs to establish workers' wages. The association believes that the following method is of the greatest concern to the industry. What are the opinions of the workers employed by each business? A comprehensive investigation is urgently needed to understand the true intentions of all workers and to determine the policy that the industry should adopt. Therefore, a test survey form is issued, hoping to be forwarded to each worker. The worker who is willing to accept which method should sign his name in his own handwriting under which method. It should be sent to the association immediately for verification. This is a special notice.</p>
<p>Statistical Results</p>
<p>This test survey form has two main points: (1) Willing to continue to follow the old rules, not to take wages, in order to obtain</p>
<p>Shakes the Police Station</p>
<h3>Stolen From Inside A British Barracks: Safe Deposit Box: The Amount of Silver Contained in the Box is Unknown: The Guard at the Gate Claimed to Have Seen No One</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that a safe deposit box in the British Army Jasper Road Barracks in Shanghai disappeared suddenly on Monday morning. The officers in the camp were all surprised and disbelieving. Although the person in charge of the box has not announced the details, it is heard that the box contains several hundred yuan in cash and some documents from two companies of Lancashire soldiers stationed in the camp. Just after 5 o'clock on Monday morning, the loss of the box was discovered, and the police were immediately notified. This shocking news was immediately spread to all police stations in Shanghai. The exact amount of cash in the box has not been told to news reporters. The detectives and officers handling the case are currently keeping the details of the case secret. The box must have been stolen in the night. What is strange is that why did the soldier guarding the gate not see the thief carrying the box out of the camp? The soldier guarding the gate firmly claimed that he had not seen anyone carrying the box out of the camp that morning. The box is medium-sized and very strong. Its weight cannot be carried away by one person alone. At least two or more people must have participated in this theft. At that time, it was obviously difficult to open due to its strength, and in a hurry, the thieves carried it away and opened it leisurely elsewhere. The tips given at will by the tourists; (2) Willing to cancel extra tips and all other income and obtain the stipulated monthly salary. The association issued a total of 1,150 test forms. As of yesterday, 862 copies had been returned, with a total of 5,862 workers listed. Only 36 people were willing to cancel extra tips and obtain wages, which proves that the absolute majority of workers still want to maintain the old rules.</p>
<h3>Xu Liaoshi Abducts Gong Lanying; Taking her to a Procurer's Shop Likely Had Ulterior Motives</h3>
<p>Gong Lanying, a 15-year-old girl from Qingpu, was helping to collect rice buckets at a bao fan (meal catering) shop run by her uncle, Gong Binlin, at No. 12 Le'an Lane, Jialong Lane, Old North Gate, because both of her parents were deceased. Her life was unbearably miserable. She was often beaten for small mistakes. A fellow villager, Xu Liaoshi (27 years old, working as a maid), seeing Lanying's hardships and ragged clothes, persuaded Lanying to work as a maid at a procurer's shop, where she could earn wages, which would be better than working for free at her uncle's place. Lanying was seduced and introduced to the procurer's shop, which recommended her to work as a maid at the Zhao family in Zhangyuan Lane, with a monthly salary of one yuan. When Gong Binlin found out about this, he twisted Xu Liaoshi over to the Old North Gate Police Station, accusing her of abduction. After interrogation, it was found that the case involved fraud and enticement, and the defendant was handed over to the bureau for handling.</p>

<h3>Detectives and Bandits: Fierce Battle in Western Shanghai: Both Sides Opened Fire Thirty to Forty Times; Three Passersby Injured, One Bandit Captured</h3>
<p>At 7:30 last night, four bandits, each armed with guns, suddenly arrived at the residence of the manager of a large department store at No. 19, Lusena Road. They broke into the inner room and searched wantonly. At that time, the owner and servants of the house, seeing that things were not good, immediately reported the crime to the police station. The Jing'an Temple police station in charge received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of armed detectives to rush to encircle and arrest them. However, the bandits were unusually alert and silently observed that the behavior of the owner and others was not right, and they immediately took the stolen goods and fled out the door to the west. Unexpectedly, they met the detectives. The bandits fled towards Daxilu Road, firing shots to resist arrest along the way. All the detectives also chased and fired back. When they reached the intersection of Daxilu and Dunxin Road, the bandits saw that the detectives had gathered from all sides and could not escape. They immediately leaned against the wall and confronted the police. Then, a fierce battle began between the two sides. In total, no less than thirty to forty bullets were fired, as dense as a string of beads, and bullets fell like rain. At this time, a bandit hoped to escape from Dunxin Road and was arrested by a detective. The remaining three bandits waited until the bullets were exhausted and then fled into the dark wilderness there. Because they were released by the rabbit, only when the detectives were engaged in fierce fighting did two women and a rickshaw puller get injured by stray bullets. One was the wife of Cai Chunyuan, a comprador at a Westerner's house at No. 27 Dunxin Road, 26 years old, who was hit in the left eye by a bullet that exited from the back of her head, and her condition was extremely critical. One was an old woman from Jiangbei in a thatched shed there, about 50 years old, who was injured in the right ear. The rickshaw puller was only injured in the leg and was not seriously injured. All were sent to the hospital for treatment by the detectives. A bandit was captured alive and taken to the police station for detention, pending the arrest of his accomplices and joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Saccharin, Etc.: Must Be Sold With Caution; General Anti-Smoking Association Orders New Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>National Government Military Commission General Anti-Smoking Association Order No. 2722</p>
<h3>Inside A Teahouse in Caoxiebang, A Bloodied Man; Chopped Five Times with an Axe While Having Tea; Police Have Captured Two Criminals</h3>
<p>Last night at 8 o'clock, the Public Concession Putuo Road Police Station suddenly received a post alarm, stating that a murder case had occurred in a teahouse in Caoxiebang, and the murderers had all fled. The police station received the news and immediately dispatched detectives to rush there. They only saw a man lying in the teahouse, covered in blood, about 20 years old, wearing white broadcloth pants, barely breathing. They quickly summoned an ambulance and rushed him to the hospital for treatment. It was found that the man had been chopped 15 times with an axe, with the most serious injury in the waist. He was completely unable to speak, so his name was unknown. Observing his appearance, he looked like a vagrant. According to people in the teahouse, the cause of the victim was caused by qi jiang cha (gangland mediation). As for the appearance of the murderer, some were also slightly familiar. The police then arrested two murderers in the vicinity based on this point and learned that there were still accomplices, who are currently under strict investigation. However, the injured person suffered severe injuries and was on the verge of death. It was heard that he had died of his injuries by 12 o'clock, ordering the Joint Association of New Pharmaceutical Industry Guilds of the City, presenting a case for requesting the speedy formulation of measures for the transportation and sale of medicinal quinine, saccharin, lactose, and gelatin powder, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. Having been informed, it is found that the Administrative Yuan's 272nd Yuan Yi [meeting] has decided that there is no need to restrict or ban the transportation and sale of saccharin, sugar powder, and lactose in order to benefit the proper use of the medical industry. According to the previous situation, the relevant documents of the case will be copied and ordered to be informed. However, saccharin and other items can indeed be mixed into heroin, red and white pills, etc., to increase the weight of drugs. If pharmaceutical merchants and colleagues properly transport and sell these items for proper medical use, they must sell them with caution. If the anti-smoking authorities conduct inspections, they should at any time accurately indicate the sales channels for verification. This order includes a copy of a public letter from the Administrative Yuan, a copy of a public letter originally attached from the Ministry of Health, and a copy of the minutes of the review meeting.

<h3>Pregnant Woman Injured By Car Dies Tragically; Seven-Month-Old Dead Baby Born; City Tigers are Terrible, Families are Destroyed</h3>
<p>Zhang Junhong, from Ningbo, lived at No. 79, Tongle Lane, Huasheng Road. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, because his wife, Ma, was pregnant and suffering from diarrhea, he hired a rickshaw driven by Wang Fuchang from Jiangbei to go together to a doctor's office on Nanjing Road, Shilu Road. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw passed the intersection of East Xihua Road and Huaji Road, a truck No. 16621 of Tongchang Automobile Firm in the South City and the Sixteenth Pier, driven by Wang Weiqing from Jiangbei, tried to pass Zhang's rickshaw, causing Zhang's rickshaw to overturn. Zhang Junhong suffered a brain injury, and Mrs. Ma was also injured. However, because Zhang Junhong suffered too much injury, he died after being sent to the hospital at about 9 o'clock that night. Afterwards, the driver who caused the accident was sent to the court by the police station for investigation, and he was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. The details have been recorded in this newspaper on the 21st. It is now learned that Mrs. Zhang Ma, after suffering this injury, often returned home and felt pain in her abdomen. She went to the Shanghai Municipal Hospital in the South City for treatment. After examination by the hospital, it was learned that the seven-month-old fetus in her womb had no hope of survival. The next day (the 24th), the baby was indeed born, and had already stopped breathing. Who would have thought that Mrs. Zhang, after giving birth, suddenly became ill due to excessive internal injuries? The doctors were helpless, and she also died at 4 o'clock yesterday morning. A family of three all died at the hands of city tigers. A happy family was destroyed in an instant. The driver who caused the accident is truly guilty of unpardonable crimes. It is also learned that before Mrs. Ma died, she repeatedly called out "Tongchang" in her mouth. How tragic.</p>
<h3>The Main Culprit in the Case of Beating a Laborer to Death Has Been Arrested; Verified that Death Was Due to Spleen Injury Turning into Disease</h3>
<p>At about 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 20th of this month, Western Constable No. 252 of the Old Gate Police Station, while patrolling the intersection of Suzhou Road and Fujian Road, saw a man lying on the side of the road. He immediately called an ambulance to come and send him to Renji Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. On one hand, he reported back to the police station, and under investigation by Chinese Detective Yan Shiqing, it was learned that the man's name was Liu Hailin, 21 years old, from Wuxi. After being diagnosed by the doctor, Liu's spleen was severely injured. At the time, because Liu was unconscious, he did not know the cause of the injury. Yan went to the scene to investigate. According to the merchants in the vicinity, several laborers from the Public Works Department of the Ministry of Industry had a conflict with a worker-like person while washing and sweeping the streets in the Suzhou Fujian Road area. They beat each other, and the worker fell to the ground. The laborers of the Public Works Department also dispersed. Detective Yan went to the Public Works Department to investigate. It turned out that the workers had been dispatched to the area at that time. He then ordered all the workers to go to Shiji Hospital to let Liu Hailin identify them. Liu pointed out worker Li Shengnian No. 163 among the workers. The detective then detained Li. Li confessed that the person who beat Liu was actually Shen Guisheng, a laborer No. 155. It was found that Shen Guisheng had not arrived at the scene when he was identified at Renji Hospital, and that Liu Changgui had replaced him, which was obviously false. Shen was arrested in a thatched shed on Gonghe New Road on the day before yesterday and brought to the Public Security Bureau. Shen confessed that he had beaten Liu. The detectives requested that Shen be brought back first to allow Liu to identify him, but the Public Security Bureau did not allow it. By the time he was brought back, Liu had already died at 3 p.m. the day before yesterday, so it was too late. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him according to Article 258, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, for injury causing death. When Shen was questioned, he confessed that he had beaten the deceased in the buttocks, but Liu had acted first. Judge Qian Hongye then ordered a postponement of one week for further interrogation. Subsequently, Inspector Tang of the Special First Court arrived at the corpse site to examine it. It was verified that Liu Hailin had indeed suffered a spleen injury before his death, had undergone surgery, and had died from a disease. The corpse was handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>New Pharmaceutical Industry Representative Went to Beijing and Zhenjiang Yesterday to Petition for the Debt of Two Pharmacies in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Zhu Yuquan, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Yuan Hesong, Supervisory Committee Member, and others, went to Beijing and Zhenjiang yesterday with a written petition. The petition stated: "Submitting this document is regarding the Wuxi Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies, which are suspected of drug trafficking. Their assets have been completely confiscated, affecting creditors and hindering the execution of civil trials. We request a review and instructions on relief measures. The petitioners are the creditors of the Wuxi Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies, totaling seventy-nine households (organized as a group). The total amount of debt under Taihe's name is 32,458 yuan, 9 jiao, 3 fen, and 5 li. The total amount of debt under Zhongwai's name is 31,961 yuan, 7 jiao, and 9 fen, and 7 li. All are legitimate commercial debts. It is inappropriate that the Taihe Pharmacy was ordered to be sealed by the local government due to suspected drug trafficking. Furthermore, because Hu Shutang, the owner of Zhongwai Pharmacy, is one of the shareholders of Taihe Pharmacy, Zhongwai Pharmacy was also subjected to the same sealing treatment. After hearing the news, the petitioners believed that the business's assets were the entire guarantee for all its external debts. They repeatedly submitted petitions and sent representatives to the Second District Security Command of Jiangsu Province to state their reasons and request relief. In addition to receiving approval to wait for legal processing, they also discussed face-to-face to ensure that creditors would not suffer losses. The petitioners immediately filed lawsuits against Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies in accordance with the law, seeking payment. Subsequently, the Wuxi District Court issued judgments No. 204 and No. 205 in the 24th year, ordering Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies to repay the goods in full, which were finalized on record. After applying for enforcement, the Wuxi District Court inquired with the Second District Security Command of Jiangsu Province and planned to take over the sealed assets of the two pharmacies for valuation and auction. The reply stated, in essence, that Hu Shutang, who opened the Taihe Pharmacy, had been proven to have sold drugs, and all of his assets had been confiscated in accordance with the drug control and punishment regulations, and the case had been submitted for review. Hu Shutang has absconded and is being wanted. Before he is apprehended, there are doubts about the debts of the petitioners, and it was not approved. The petitioners were shocked after being informed of the situation by the Civil Enforcement Office of the Wuxi District Court. According to the recent interpretation by the Military Affairs Commission, the confiscation under the drug control and punishment regulations is limited to those who have no rights other than the offender. The Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies owe the petitioners tens of thousands of yuan. The majority of their assets, including drug inventory, were obtained from the petitioners without payment. Externally, these assets serve as the entire guarantee for their debts. Confiscating all of these assets at once would significantly harm the rights of the petitioners. Article 19 of the Provisional Regulations for Drug Control and Punishment, promulgated by the National Government on June 3 of this year, states that those who commit the crimes in Articles 3 to 5 of these regulations may have all or part of their property confiscated. The execution of property confiscation shall apply the provisions of the rules of civil procedure and the supplementary civil enforcement measures. There are two points that can be studied here. First, the nature of confiscation is an accessory punishment that must be declared simultaneously with the principal punishment after the offender is apprehended and tried. Whether or not confiscation should be imposed is based on the principle of discretion, and there is room for discretion. Second, since the execution of confiscation should apply the rules of civil enforcement law, any creditor who has obtained an enforcement title should not be excluded due to the confiscation. Currently, Hu Shutang, who is accused of drug trafficking, is still at large and has not been apprehended. The judgment or disposition of confiscating all of his assets should not be made in advance. Furthermore, the petitioners' debts have been finalized by judgment, they have obtained an enforcement title, and compulsory enforcement has begun. They should not be excluded due to suspicion. The Second District Security Command has obstructed the execution of the final civil judgment against Taihe and Zhongwai Pharmacies based on the confiscation of all of Hu Shutang's assets. Their view is undoubtedly mistaken. Therefore, we petition your honorable office to examine the previous situation, rectify the errors when reviewing the judgment of the case, and immediately provide relief measures so that the effectiveness of the court's judgment will not be hindered by drug control measures, and creditors will not suffer unexpected losses. This would be a great benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu Security Command and the General Supervisor of Anti-Smoking of the Military Affairs Commission."</p>

<h3>Guanyinge Lane: A Secret Smoking Room Discovered; Quick Detachable Ladder; Smoker Escapes; Inspector Pursues and Falls, Injuring Himself</h3>
<p>Chen Shusheng, the household registration inspector of the Yimiao Police Station, was ordered by the General Bureau to conduct a general investigation of smokers in the city, which was extended to August 31st. As the deadline approached, he was to investigate unregistered smokers door-to-door and verify whether licensed smokers were using false names to allow others to smoke. Once discovered, they would be punished according to the law. A few days ago, Inspector Chen and others were investigating door-to-door at No. 20, Guanyinge Lane, and paid close attention to the second landlord of the house because he was sheltering smokers. Unexpectedly, they discovered a secret room on the third floor attic where someone was smoking. Inspector Chen immediately went upstairs to investigate and arrest them. However, there was a quick detachable ladder, allowing the smoker to escape. Inspector Chen tried hard to pursue them but fell off the ladder, injuring his right knee. Fortunately, the injury was not serious. After applying medicine and bandaging, he continued to work as usual. It is said that in recent days, he has arrested more than forty smokers who were smoking without a license, and all have been sent to the bureau for legal action.</p>

<h3>Huang Lijuan Sues Kong Zuan for Seduction and Abandonment; Civil Lawsuit Settled Out of Court; Criminal Lawsuit Concluded and Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Kong Zuan, the young owner of the Renhe Weaving Factory on Belle Road in the French Concession, abandoned Huang Lijuan, a girl from Hunan, after they lived together and had a daughter. As a result, she filed a criminal lawsuit against him in the First Special District Court for crimes such as seduction and abandonment. It has already been tried once, as reported in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing continued the hearing. First, Huang Lijuan testified that the girl was born on October 1st of last year in Hengxin Lane, Shigaota Road. Since March of this year, the defendant has not provided living expenses. Before the decision to hold a hearing, she was advised to settle out of court, but the defendant only agreed to give 1,000 yuan and proposed conditions for breaking off relations, so it was difficult to accept. The defendant's father-in-law, the current chairman of the Weaving Industry Association, also helped the defendant with money. In addition, Sun Du, Huang's wet nurse, testified that she was hired just five days after the little girl was born. Kong went to Hengxin Lane every day, and she called Kong "young master." Her salary was paid by Kong. Since moving to Tongfu Road, Kong's visits have gradually decreased because Kong's family already knew about Kong's mistress. After moving to the current residence on Fuxu Road, Kong disappeared completely. She also told the plaintiff that Kong had not provided living expenses for a long time. Kong Zuan confessed that the nanny's statement was very correct, but the living expenses that should have been paid were stopped only after the plaintiff filed a lawsuit against me. Now, although I am willing to pay, the plaintiff's desires are extravagant, requiring thousands or even tens of thousands of yuan. Huang said that what I want now is not money, but to ask the defendant to fulfill the marriage promise. She then presented a paper from Kong to the court. After Judge Zhong examined it, he asked Kong how to explain the words "eternal love," "never break my heart," and "provide living expenses" in the paper. Kong claimed that the paper was tricked by the plaintiff to write, and I only intended to take her as a concubine. The court then instructed the two parties to settle the civil part out of court by themselves, and the criminal part was immediately started for debate. The plaintiff's lawyer, Hu Yongde, then listed the facts of the case, saying that the defendant had indeed committed the crimes of seduction and abandonment, and requested that he be punished according to the law. Following Tian, the defendant's lawyer Shi Chao argued that the two crimes alleged by the plaintiff could not be established. After both sides finished their arguments, Judge Zhong ordered them to withdraw and wait for the verdict on the afternoon of September 1st.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Special Issue</p>
<h3>Humble Suggestions to National Goods Female Interviewers</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Women's Association not only organized a women's national goods consumption group, but also held national goods home visits, inviting female interviewers to visit and persuade families to use national goods. I strongly agree with this initiative, as it is a good method and intention—because women are the rulers of the family, and all items used for food and clothing in the family are managed by the housewife. Now, using women as interviewers to visit and persuade housewives door-to-door will surely achieve significant results in the promotion of national goods and achieve twice the result with half the effort. The reason is that interviewers and housewives are of the same sex, which will make conversations more convenient. If they can earnestly persuade and advise, they can gain trust and understanding, which is very different from men persuading women, which is incompatible. However, I have two points to contribute to the female interviewers, and I will write them down below for adoption:</p>
<p>First, the age of the female interviewers should be middle-aged women, because if they are too young, people will think they are inexperienced and even ridicule them, and if they are too old, they will think they are outdated. As for their words, they should be tactful and alert, earnestly informing them of the advantages and disadvantages, so that listeners will be moved and naturally develop patriotic thoughts, and fulfill the responsibility of visiting and persuading.</p>
<p>Second, the female interviewers should wear badges on their chests to facilitate their entry into the boudoir and carefully inspect all the items in the room. Even if all the appliances or food in the room are imported goods or a large number of smuggled goods, they should calmly persuade them to eat and use up the existing ones, and not allow them to buy them again to avoid punishment. At the same time, they must also guide them to purchase high-quality national goods that can be substituted, so that people will not mistakenly purchase them. They must avoid speaking loudly and angrily, and becoming embarrassed and angry, which will cause resentment!</p>
<p>Other aspects of the female interviewers' own clothing and behavior should be strictly self-checked in advance! Do they adhere to the national goods creed without any conflicts? Because only by setting an example can they influence others.</p>

<h3>Ladies Are Joining the Women's National Goods Consumption Association</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>In this day and age, national goods are really having good luck. The East advocates national goods, and the West also advocates national goods. Especially the women's community is even more happy to participate in this national goods movement to save the country. The Shanghai Women's Association has organized a Women's National Goods Consumption Committee and is working hard to promote national goods. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal National Goods Movement Federation also sent letters to the managers of national goods factories and national goods companies, urging their wives to join the newly organized Women's National Goods Consumption Association. It is extremely meaningful and valuable for the family members of the leaders of the national goods industry to lead this national goods consumption work. I think that these wives of the leaders of the national goods industry are all known in society for being good helpmates. They usually help their husbands and do a lot of work. Now they also want to help their husbands to do the work of promoting national goods. Originally, the husband devoted himself to the national goods business all day long, and won many honors for national goods. Therefore, the wife should follow her husband to work hard to consume national goods. There is absolutely no situation in the world where the husband manufactures national goods, but the wife is happy to promote foreign goods. Therefore, it is a matter of course, the most reasonable, and the most practical and effective thing for the wives of the leaders of the national goods industry to promote national goods, sell national goods, and consume national goods. Without waiting for the husband to urge them to join, I think that the general wives will automatically and happily join, so that the loving couple can work together under the banner of the national goods movement.</p>
<p>We also want to go one step further. It is not enough for the wives to join the Women's National Goods Consumption Association. If they do not join, then so be it. After joining, they must earnestly implement it. When buying an item or using a utensil, they must first silently think about whether it is a Chinese product? Is it a genuine national product? The inspection must be serious, and the investigation must be strict. Not only must they be sincere to themselves, but they must also persuade relatives and encourage family members to work hard under the banner of national goods consumption. Do not be afraid of speaking until your tongue is tired and your lips are dry, do not be afraid of trouble, and even less be afraid of being disliked or ridiculed by others. Undoubtedly, resolutely and decisively work with your beloved husband to do this valuable national goods movement. The day when national goods are popular and foreign goods disappear is the day when the wives' merits are completed.</p>
<h3>Reflections After Reading "The Position of National Goods in the National Economy"</h3>
<p>— Meng Zhao</p>
<p>The national goods speech movement is indeed an urgent matter in this extraordinary period! It makes the Chinese people hear and understand the meaning of national goods broadcasting, and they can never forget it with every meal, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people! Its effect is very great! After reading Mr. Yang Yao's speech manuscript, "The Position of National Goods in the National Economy," I couldn't help but sigh.</p>
<p>People in the same industry must be jealous! This seems to be a unique iron law of China? Especially in the national goods business, instead of thinking about contacting and uniting, working together to improve, they only know jealousy! Imitation, destruction, and slander, so that mutual attacks are often heard. May I ask, if the national goods industry is internally scattered, what hope is there for the future of the business? It only reduces the compatriots' faith in using national goods! And national goods and the national economy will never have the hope of connection. This is one reason.</p>
<p>To seek the active development of national goods, studying the psychological preferences of the Chinese people is indeed the key! If national goods cater to the psychology of the Chinese people and are welcomed! Then the national goods psychological construction of the Chinese people is really the greatest force! As Mr. Pan said: "The major problem of my country's national goods lies in closing the door to build cars, in selfishness, and not catering to the psychology of general users, so that all products are not suitable for sale in various places..." These words are correct. From this point of view, it is difficult to win without studying the psychology of users. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>General merchants should also reflect! As Chinese, they should sell Chinese goods! They must not be accomplices! They must not be salesmen for foreign goods! They must not dig the grave of their own economic demise! This is the third reason.</p>
<p>Consumers should know to love and use national goods. The money is still flowing into the hands of the Chinese people. It is originally unnecessary to consider Chu bow Chu de. Instead, they should reform the ignorant and inferior psychology of using foreign goods as fashionable! Everyone knows this meaning, and then everyone will love and use national goods, learn the integrity of the people of strong countries everywhere, the country will not prosper, and the family will not flourish! And the position of the national economy will naturally be prosperous and consolidated! This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>The rule of not purchasing and using national goods and not approving expenditure reimbursement should not only apply to government agencies, but also to general industrial, commercial, educational, and other agencies. If the general affairs office purchases goods and finds no valid national goods invoice, they should not be reimbursed. According to this method, they can change their course and honestly purchase national goods in the future! This is the fifth reason.</p>
<p>The above points are the opinions and thoughts that I have after reading Mr. Yang'an's speech manuscript!</p>
<h3>Autumn and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Wei Sigeng</p>
<p>The four seasons of the year are in constant cycle, and people have gone through the mild spring and the hot summer, and now it is the cool autumn.</p>
<p>Autumn is cool, and following autumn is the cold winter. However, although the seasons change like this, people's patriotic hearts must not be like the seasons, becoming cold and bleak! Becoming ruthless! It should always maintain the same level of warmth.</p>
<p>Therefore, since we already knew to use national goods in summer, we still have to use national goods in autumn, such as clothing, socks, shoes, and hats... These items that must be added when the seasons change, of course, still adhere to the previous principle: "Only national goods are used."</p>
<p>Also, in autumn, mosquitoes will spread malaria! And people who have eaten too much melon and fruit in the summer are prone to dysentery... All of these must be prevented and treated. I will also take this opportunity to introduce the giant branch mosquito coil from Wuzhou Pharmacy and the domestically produced dysentery treatment, "An Li Sheng."</p>
<h3>Two Major National Woolen Fabrics Enter the Market</h3>
<p>Empress Brand Glossy Wool · Double Hands Double Sheep Brand Wool</p>
<p>Woolen fabrics are mostly imported from abroad, with an annual outflow of more than ten million yuan. Since last year, prominent merchants Mr. Chen and Mr. Bi traveled east to study the wool weaving industry. After returning to China, they purchased a large number of machines and established the China Woolen Fabric Factory on Linqing Road, Yangshupu, employing thousands of workers. They meticulously produce Empress Brand four-strand cashmere glossy wool, with bright colors that do not fade in water, and the size is extra long. To make an underwear, if using foreign woolen fabric, it would require about two pounds, but if using Empress Brand glossy wool, one pound is more than enough. With the same price per pound each month, it is equivalent to buying two pounds of foreign goods with one pound of Empress Brand glossy wool. The lightness and softness of the texture are especially rare. Now that autumn and winter are approaching, a large batch has been rushed to market, and various places both domestic and foreign have been vying to purchase in bulk.</p>
<p>Yumin Woolen Fabric Company was established by Mr. Ni Xifang and others, a prominent figure in the wool yarn industry on Xingsheng Street. The woolen fabrics produced include the Double Hands Brand and the Double Sheep Brand. Mr. Ni has served in the woolen fabric industry for decades, with rich experience. He has unique insights into selecting raw materials and dyeing. Therefore, since its introduction last year, it has been popular for a time. Schoolgirls and ladies in boudoirs have been vying to buy it, and it is praised as a leader among national woolen fabrics. Starting this year, large quantities have been sent to various places, so there will be no worry of shortages as in previous years.</p>

<h3>The Future Trend of Social Education in Our Country and Its Improvement Training Film and Broadcasting Education Personnel Hasten to Compile Civil School Textbooks and Supplementary Readers</h3>
<p>In the past 24 years, the central social education funding was only more than 809,000 yuan, accounting for only 2.3% of the total national education and cultural expenses. However, only 9 provinces and cities could raise social education funds that accounted for 10% to 20% of the total education expenses. In view of this, the Ministry of Education actively promoted social education in the 25th year. On the one hand, it allocated 1.1 million yuan from the temporary education construction fee in the central 25th year budget for public education, film and broadcasting education, etc. (500,000 for the public, 250,000 for films, 250,000 for broadcasting, and 100,000 for reading materials). On the other hand, it ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to refer to the repeated orders of the Ministry to raise social education funds, striving to gradually reach the standards set by the Ministry. Regarding the school-style public schools education, the provinces and cities have been ordered to expand as much as possible, but non-school-style, more popular and most common film and broadcasting education can deeply affect the people and widely spread. Therefore, the Ministry of Education organized film and broadcasting education committees this year, and the two associations jointly formed an electrical education personnel training class to train wireless radio technicians and educational film projection personnel for various provincial and municipal education institutions, for the use of implementing electrical education in various provinces and cities. This kind of training class is scheduled to start on September 10th. This is to cultivate social education teachers for the promotion of social education in the future. It is also a new tool for the Ministry of Education to use electrical education as an auxiliary tool for social education this year. As for the editing of public reading materials, it is also an essential task. During this difficult period, promoting public education is not only about teaching literacy. It is necessary to awaken national consciousness and infuse patriotic thoughts. Therefore, improving public textbooks and compiling supplementary readers is an essential plan. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has begun to edit and improve public reading materials. Generally, for public school textbooks, carefully selected teaching materials for civics, national language, common sense, and music are mixed and compiled, with nationalism as the ideological center. It has begun editing, aiming to distribute them to various provinces and cities for application before the start of the next semester. After the textbooks are compiled, teaching methods will be rushed to meet the needs. The advanced textbooks will be started in the spring. All current public school textbooks will be reviewed, and the excellent ones will be rewarded. Those that are unsuitable will be ordered to be revised or banned. In addition, supplementary textbooks for public schools are planned to be compiled by experts according to local conditions, including one book for farmers, workers, businessmen, and women, and one each for the central, northern, and southern regions, according to climate and soil conditions. After the public school textbooks are completed, the editing will continue. For public supplementary reading materials, the biggest task is to edit the public library, which aims to develop national consciousness, cultivate national morality, supplement common sense of life, facilitate self-study in spare time, and guide the nation's self-awareness and upward movement. The editing method is divided into social, natural, application, self-cultivation, and national construction historical materials and party doctrines. The second is to edit comic strips, because those that are already popular in the market mostly contain obscenity, theft, and the promotion of gods and monsters and superstition. Therefore, efforts are made to remedy them and compile new versions to replace them. The third is to edit other popular reading materials, public dictionaries, study basic characters and basic words for the public, and improve various current public supplementary reading materials. These are all the general situations of the Ministry of Education's careful sorting and improvement of public reading materials this year.</p>

However, Mr. Li, as he is about to retire from soccer, has politely declined.</p>

<h3>A Record of Our Country's Soccer Team's European Tour</h3>
<p>— Written and sent by Li Huitang</p>
<p>(July 5) Although our match yesterday was not particularly brilliant, today's newspapers and public opinion have been extremely laudatory, considering it a top-notch team. At noon, we were hosted at a banquet by the All-India Football Association. Those present were all well-known figures in the sports world, numbering three or four hundred. After the president gave a speech and presented our team with eleven gold commemorative medals, Director Rong and I offered our thanks in succession. After taking a group photo, we dispersed. In the evening, we were invited by an Indian cinema to watch an Indian national film, which included newsreel footage of our match yesterday. It was quite amusing to see a scene of us chasing and running replayed on the screen. During the intermission, I was invited to the stage to introduce each player to the audience. A wave of cheers and applause erupted, and our team responded by shouting "Long live India!" three times.</p>
<p>Victory over the Anglo-Indian Combined Team</p>
<p>(July 6) The second match in Karachi was against the Anglo-Indian combined team, whose strength was even more complete. It rained in the morning, making the weather feel cool, which pleased us all greatly. This is because our team never performs well when the weather is hot and the field is hard. Moreover, for the past ten days in Rangoon, every match has had a light rain, making the field slightly slippery but not too muddy, which is extremely advantageous for our team's performance. This has become a habit, and the reason why our first match the other day was not up to par was not without cause. Although the weather was not ideal today, it still drizzled during the match, but the audience did not hesitate to attend, and the spectacle was no less than the previous day. At the start of the match, our team lined up as follows. The score was 2-1 in the first half, with a final result of 2-1. The scorers were Huitang,</p>
<p>Bao Jiaping</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai Li Tiansheng</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Liang Rongzhao Zhang Xianyuan</p>
<p>Ye Beihua Sun Jinshun Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>Our team did not leave a good impression in the first match, so we changed our formation today. Because Jiangbai had no success in the front, he was moved to the left back, and Yahui was still weak and had not recovered after his illness, so Rongzhao was placed in the center and Xianyuan on the right. The forwards Beihua and Guicheng were assigned to the flanks. Jingxiang, who had injured his knee in Medan, had been out of action for almost a month. His reappearance today provided a tremendous boost to the front line. The field was quite slippery due to the rain. At the start of the match, Huitang scored a goal from the left wing with a clever short pass through the middle. Afterwards, the opponent's counterattack was very fierce. Fortunately, Jiaping was agile and repeatedly saved dangerous shots, divinely and miraculously, as if aided by Heaven. However, after a long defense, they finally conceded one goal from a corner kick. Soon after, our front line became active again, and Huitang scored another goal with a long shot. The score was 2-1 in the first half. After switching sides, both teams attacked and defended, and the situation was tense. The goalkeepers of both sides repeatedly displayed amazing skills, much to the admiration of the audience. Until the end of the game, there were no further gains or losses. Our team's performance improved on this day, especially the forwards' rapid attacks and beautiful shots. Jiaping's strong defense today was praised by the people here. The other players all performed well and were admired. After the match, each player received a silver shield and a small medal. Huitang gave a speech expressing his gratitude, and then we hurried back to the residence to shower and prepare to take the train to Bombay at 8 PM.</p>
<p>(July 7) Karachi and Bombay are located in the east and west, respectively, more than 1,300 miles apart, and the train takes 38 hours to reach. After the match yesterday, we hurriedly showered, packed our luggage, and arrived at the station at 8:30 PM. We quickly had dinner and said goodbye to the well-wishers before departing at 9 PM. The cars had sleeping berths, and five people occupied one compartment, which was not connected to others. Therefore, we could only meet people at the train stations along the way. The weather in Lanping is usually hot, with the scorching sun oppressive. This day and night train journey is the most tiring. Fortunately, it rained continuously today, and it was cool all day. Last night, we even had to cover ourselves with wool blankets to ward off the cold wind. We bought all three meals, breakfast, lunch, and dinner, in the dining car. There were many stops along the way, so we did not feel lonely or suffer the pain of being separated from others.</p>
<p>Draw with Bombay Players</p>
<p>(July 8) Bombay is known as the "Gateway of India," and those coming from the West must pass through this place. I got up at 7:30 in the morning to wash and pack my luggage. Bombay was right in front of me. Many people came to welcome us at the station, including officials from the Football Association, our country's consul, and leaders from the overseas Chinese community. The station was noisy and chaotic for a while. After taking pictures, we left the station and went to the "Jilian" Hotel for a short rest. Then, we went to a welcoming meeting held by the overseas Chinese community. After the formalities were completed, each representative gave earnest exhortations. After the tea party, we returned to our residence to prepare for the last match of our southern tour against the local players in the afternoon. Having been confined in the train for the past two days, we were playing immediately upon arrival today. Given our excellent record of not having lost a single match, we were especially afraid of slipping up in this last match and ruining our previous achievements. Therefore, everyone was in a state of fear and rested as much as possible, not daring to go out for leisure. We went to the field at 5:30 PM. The field here was small, with only about 10,000 spectators. From this, it can be seen that the passion for soccer here is far inferior to that in Calcutta. After shaking hands with the mayor and the consuls of China and Germany, we deployed our formation to face the challenge. The score was 2-1 in the first half, with a final result of 3-3. The scorers were Huitang (2) and Shun (1).</p>
<p>Bao Jianian</p>
<p>Tan Jiangbai Li Dasheng</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Xu Yahui Liang Rongzhao</p>
<p>Ye Beihua Sun Shun Li Huitang Feng Jingxiang Cao Guicheng</p>
<p>The two teams faced off and the whistle blew to start the game. Most of the opposing team were soldiers, and their tactics were very similar to those of the British army in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Their skills were good, and their strength was especially abundant. As soon as we made contact, we knew that a strong enemy was in front of us, and it would not be easy to deal with. Everyone was very careful and cautious. In the first half, Yu and Shun successively scored goals. Jiaping was careless and lost a goal. At halftime, our team was leading 2-1. After switching sides, our defense gradually weakened. Due to mistakes by Tiansheng and Jiangbai, they scored one goal in fifteen minutes, reversing the victory. At that time, the weather changed again, and heavy rain poured down, making it difficult to run and kick. Although the forwards repeatedly shot, they were all saved by the goalkeeper, or hit the crossbar, or went too high, or went too wide, as if they were being protected by the gods. It was a critical moment, and we thought that our undefeated record would surely be lost in this last match today, with no hope of escape. Therefore, the forwards became increasingly anxious to shoot, and the more anxious they were, the more they lost their accuracy, to no avail. Fortunately, Heaven does not forsake people. Seven minutes before the end of the game, an opposing defender was penalized for using his hand to save the ball, and Yu successfully converted the penalty kick. However, we had already broken out in a cold sweat. It was really fortunate that we were able to end the game in a draw.</p>
<p>Our team's performance on this day, in order to achieve complete success, was too serious, so it was not very exciting. The forwards were still decent, but the defense's positioning was confused. All three goals were lost due to defensive omissions, which was a pity. However, being able to recover our undefeated reputation from a near-death experience, in the midst of faint hope, was also a stroke of good luck in misfortune. In the evening, the Football Association hosted a dinner and dance party. The music was melodious, the cups clinked, and after a little drunkenness, the dance was graceful. Everyone enjoyed themselves, and they didn't realize how late it was until the clock struck two.</p>
<p>Since we left the country in early May, it has been less than seventy days. We have had 27 matches with four draws and no defeats, dominating the Asian region. Our record can be considered rare and precious. Moreover, the journey has been tiring, and the social engagements have been busy, especially with other matters. Looking back on the past, everything is still vividly before my eyes, which is truly comforting. When I have time, I will often write in detail about my observations during the southern tour and the differences in soccer in various places, to supplement what I have left out in my previous chronicles. I think it will also be something that soccer fans will be happy to see.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Weak Buying Power; Sharp Drop After Rise in Old Cotton; Final Price at 41.5 Yuan; A Sharp Drop of 11 Yuan Compared to Last Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for old cotton, and the market remained sluggish, mainly due to a lack of buyers. The final price was 41.5 yuan, a sharp drop of 11 yuan compared to last month's peak. This trend is frightening. As for new cotton, Tongji again made a large number of short sales, but the market remained calm. In fact, many retail investors rushed to cover their positions, and Japanese merchants also came in to support the market. The market tightened in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tongji Makes Large Short Sales</p>
<p>Before the opening of the bidding for standard cotton, old cotton for August delivery was in its final day, and the market was still weak, falling by 55 cents. The situation for distant new cotton was good, and with clear skies and high air, people became even more bearish, with prices falling by 25 cents. After the second session, it was rumored in the market that the authorities were supporting old cotton for August delivery at 41 yuan, preparing to buy 30,000 dan. As a result, market sentiment stabilized, and the panic and mistakes of the previous day were gone. Prices jumped by 1.05 yuan, with distant months improving by 20 cents. However, in the third session, old cotton continued to rise, while new cotton fell. By the close of trading, distant months improved by 15 cents again. As a result, compared to the closing price of the previous day, distant months fell by 5 to 40 cents, while August alone rose by 1 yuan. Tongji and Yuda reduced their long positions significantly, while Mingde and Runkang bought in aggressively. After the opening in the afternoon, the current month declined again. Although Tongji made large short sales of new cotton, the market was still calm. There was not much change after the settlement. By the close of trading, even more people were shorting, and distant months tended to rise. As a result, compared to the afternoon closing price, each month rose by 5 to 10 cents, while August fell sharply by 2.1 yuan. The sales volume of Tongji was 12,300 dan, Jinchang 5,700 dan, Hexing 2,000 dan, Yuda 15,700 dan, Gengfeng 3,900 dan, Shenfei 2,600 dan, Dachangcheng 3,400 dan, Taichang 3,000 dan, Dachang 2,900 dan, and Jinghua 3,700 dan. The purchases were Runkang 10,500 dan, Yikang 6,700 dan, Lianxingchang 3,700 dan, Changhe 2,900 dan, Changfeng 5,300 dan, Xincheng 5,500 dan, Yi 2,800 dan, Changyu 2,700 dan, Dafeng 7,800 dan, Mingde 7,000 dan, Dafu 3,700 dan, Jifeng 2,000 dan, Daji 2,000 dan, and Da 2,900 dan, Shenchang 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>New Cotton Factory Purchases Are Very Active</p>

<h3>Factory Inventory of Spot Yarn is Low; Standard Yarn Market is Stable; This Month's Final Price for Yarn is 7.5 Yuan Lower than July; Markets for Other Months Show a Pattern of Strong Near Months and Weak Distant Months</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, showing a slightly stable trend. This is because the spot yarn business can still be supported, and each factory's yarn inventory has decreased, so people's hearts are still at ease. However, in general, short sellers, in view of the low cotton prices, have not reduced the pressure. This month is the last day of business. It is said that a certain company alone bought 4,000 bales and sold them to the Sichuan merchants. As a result, the market sentiment turned up in the afternoon, and the final price was 197.4 yuan, which is 7.5 yuan lower than last month's 204.9 yuan.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Fell in the Morning but Recovered in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Before the opening of the standard yarn market, the overseas yarn and cotton situation was not good, and the atmosphere was dim. Each month continued to fall. After the second session, this month's yarn was the last day of business. It was rumored that Dasheng Factory had successively delivered 4,000 bales of 20-count red Kuixing yarn and was going to buy back the entire amount. As a result, the market trend turned up, gradually rebounded, and distant months rose. By the close of trading, it was heard that the Osaka Sanpin Yarn Market was sluggish and turned soft again. Juxing and Tongfeng sold a lot, but Dede alone bought a lot. As a result, each month fell by 5, 6, and 7 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day, but this month did not move. After the opening in the afternoon, a certain company was preparing to buy back this month's yarn, causing the market to turn stronger, and distant months rose. At the same time, the demand for spot yarn from customers was still healthy, and market sentiment was slightly firm, but sellers continued to put pressure on the market. As a result, each month rose by 3, 4, 5, and 9 cents to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Tongji sold 3,300 bales, Zhongxing 3,050 bales, Yuda 3,400 bales, Dafeng 1,800 bales, Tongfeng 2,100 bales, Changfeng 5,650 bales, Shengyuan 1,950 bales, Hengyi 1,800 bales, and Hexing 1,600 bales. Dafu bought 3,900 bales, Mingde 4,100 bales, Changyu 1,350 bales, Runkang 2,150 bales, Xiecheng 1,800 bales, Tonghe 2,700 bales, Xincheng 2,700 bales, Dafeng 1,150 bales, Ruidai 1,050 bales, and Senkang 1,500 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Are Smooth and Prices Are Relatively Stable</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. It is estimated that various merchants bought a total of 1,520 bales throughout the day. The selling prices were similar to those of the previous day. The purchase amounts of each merchant are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 270, Nanjing 200, Inland 600, Fellow Merchants 20, Changsha 50, Shantou 35, Tianjin 250, Jiangxi 40, Lingnan 210, Xiamen 10, Wuhu 10, Ningbo 5</p>
<h3>US Cotton Ultimately Depressed Due to Increased Spread Selling</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of the US cotton market, domestic traders and foreign merchants bought, and the prices for each month rose by 3 to 9 points. However, according to reports, there was rain in Oklahoma and eastern Texas, and local merchants and New Orleans sold back their positions. The December futures were around 11.5 cents. Traders continued to buy, and Liverpool and short sellers also bought. In general, demand was mediocre. Ultimately, the trend was depressed due to increased spread selling. Japanese merchants bought heavily when prices fell. The closing was firm. The spot price fell by 11 points, and the futures price fell by 6 to 9 points. The spot price of English cotton fell by 2 points, and the futures price fell by 4 points. The Indian cotton price initially rose due to short covering and purchases by European exporters, but then fell due to long profit-taking. The price of Pingguoer fell by 0.75 rupees, the price of Yumu was unchanged, and the price of Bai Zaxi rose by 0.25 to 2 rupees. The original telegram record is on the left (telegram dated the 24th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening predictions for the 25th are: the price of Bai Luoqi for July-August delivery is 222 rupees, down 1.5 rupees; the price of Bai Luoqi for April-May delivery is 208.5 rupees, down 1 rupee; the price of Aomula for December-January delivery is 189.5 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.</p>

<h3>Finance - The Gold Market is Lifeless - Fluctuations of Only Four Jiao Throughout the Day - Resulting in a Slight Drop of One Jiao</h3>
<p>The gold market yesterday was lifeless, with only four jiao of fluctuation throughout the day, similar to the previous day, due to the lack of changes in London spot gold. As a result, there was a slight decline. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed that the British market rose while the American market was flat.

The Central Bank's posted exchange rates revealed that both the British and American rates were flat, and the Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged.

After the opening, it rose slightly due to large traders taking advantage of low prices to make limited purchases. HSBC announced that both the British and American exchange rates were flat, and the white silver balance tax rose by 25. At this time, the market was extremely peaceful. However, as buying interest temporarily waned, those who wanted to sell came to close out positions, resulting in a slight decline.

The day's market conditions are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Securities - Only September Futures Were Traded for Public Bonds - Trading Was Very Quiet - Market Prices Fluctuated Very Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, August futures had already ceased. Only September futures, for one month, were traded on the market. October futures started trading today. The overall environment and news remained in a stalemate. Market sentiment was uncertain, and most people were watching, so trading decreased significantly. Market prices also barely fluctuated. Throughout the day, prices rose slightly at the opening in the morning and fell back slightly at the close. In the afternoon sessions, only Type C and Type D bonds saw some trading. Type D bonds were completely ignored at the opening. The remaining bonds also stagnated at a fluctuation of five fen to one jiao. Therefore, the overall market price result was only slightly better by one or two jiao, and there was no change in the 96. The total transaction volume was only 2,225,000 yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Grains - Shanghai Sales Gradually Become Active - Flour Bounces Back in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market started weak and ended strong, forming a revolving situation. After the market opened in the morning, news of foreign wheat reported that Chicago wheat was down 6-7 jiao, Canadian wheat was down 8-9 jiao, and Liverpool wheat was down 1 penny. Initially, the market sentiment remained weak, and both near and far months uniformly fell by about 3 fen. However, after continuous weakness in the downstream markets, the market had already been short for several days, and the floating profits began to generate the intention to cover positions. Customers took advantage of this weakness and successively inquired. By the second session, the market had stabilized. Approaching the afternoon opening, sales of Tianjin gang flour gradually improved, and the spot wheat market also showed signs of improvement. Retail investors emerged and became active, and buying interest suddenly became strong. By the close, the market was smooth all the way, showing a sign of spring returning to the cold valley. As a result, compared to the previous day's closing price, August and September were better by half a fen each, November was better by one fen, December was better by 2.5 li, and January was better by 7.5 li.</p>
<h3>New Long Positions in Distant Month Wheat Rise Again - Merchants Give Way, Trading 10,000 Bags of Zhongguan Wheat</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday morning, foreign wheat prices uniformly declined, and spot hedging pressure remained strong, with the near-term falling sharply by 8-9 fen. Later, as the flour market rebounded, shorts took advantage of small dips to cover positions. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere gradually became stable, and new long positions were vigorous, especially focusing on the distant months. Therefore, the rebound was stronger than the morning decline, resulting in a situation of rising far months and falling near months. However, after the first session opened for January, the selling interest in the second, third, and fourth sessions was not strong, so the market could not advance further and outwardly fell behind December. As a result of the rise and fall, August was down 6 fen, September was down 3 fen, October and November were each better by 1 fen, December was better by 3 fen, and January was down 5 fen. Zhongguan wheat in the spot market was abundant, and merchants made slight concessions. Yesterday, a total of 10,000 bags were traded. Wuhe wheat was 5.05 yuan, Shaheji wheat was 5.03 yuan, and Mingguang wheat was 5.01 yuan. Other wheat such as Linhuaiguan, Suzhou, Gaoyou, Wuhu, and Hankou wheat ranged from 5 yuan to 4.85 yuan. The higher quality goods remained firm and there were no transactions.</p>
<h3>Rice Sales Remain Sluggish - Market Prices Also Show a Gradual Decline</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 14-15 boats arrived from various gangs, carrying more than 3,000 dan of goods. However, sales in this street market were very low. The Qingdao and Dalian gangs only handled thin transactions of 300-400 bags, and Dongxin handled 50 bags. Therefore, the market situation was difficult to support and showed a downward trend. Houzaogeng rice depreciated by several fen to one jiao, and Baodao rice fell by as much as 1-2 jiao. Duyangjian was weak, but Yinbianyuan was still stable. More than 1,000 dan of Dongxin rice arrived, but sales were not strong, and prices fell again by one chi.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about ten boats arrived from various routes in Hexia. Sales of various goods in the market showed slight discounts for Baijing rice, and Yangxianbianyuan high-quality goods were slightly favored, while medium-quality goods were sluggish. Dongxin Jing rice was average, and Dubu Kejian was also weak. Market prices for Baijing high-quality goods were down by slightly less than one jiao, medium-quality goods were down slightly more than one jiao, Yangjianbianyuan high-quality goods were stable and medium-quality goods were down by several fen, Dubu Kejian was also down by slightly less than one jiao, Dongxin Jing was down by one jiao, Baodao rice was lacking in goods and there was no market, and the price of Zhuanqiao Xinjing rice was down by 1-2 jiao.</p>
<h3>The New Yellow Soybean Market Situation is Brisk</h3>
<p>Since Japanese merchants have been actively sourcing new yellow soybeans in Jiujiang, general market sentiment has become nervous that the source of supply may be obstructed, causing the market to be very tense. Owners of high-quality, dry soybeans are intentionally hoarding them, so medium-quality goods feel even more of an upward pressure. Although the prices opened yesterday were similar to the previous market, the quality was worth 2 jiao. Based on the trend, it seems brisk. Yesterday's transactions included 6,300-400 bags of various Jiujiang soybeans, over 1,000 bags of Changzhou Niupihuang soybeans, and over 700 bags of Hankou Zao Huang soybeans. The sales channels were still oil pressing factories, inland vehicle workshops, and Nanjing local streets.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea - The Price Difference Between Domestic and Foreign Silk is Too Large</h3>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk prices mostly fell, with only a few rises. New York daily silk with uniformity, and Guangdong silk, each fell 3 fen yesterday. Shanghai silk with 7-8 uniformity actually fell 5 fen. Lyon daily silk fell by half a franc, Shanghai silk of AB grades each fell by one franc, and Guangdong silk fell by 0.75 franc. New York near and far term futures, sold at practical prices, rose by one to one and a half fen compared to the previous day. Yokohama rose by about 5 to 6 yuan. The domestic market price is vastly different from overseas silk prices. For example, the B grade of Baichang at 20.22 filaments only fetched a price of 630 yuan, a difference of 3-4 yuan compared to Shanghai sales. Similarly, fine filament (11.13) of Shanghai Baichang silk, such as Fengtai holding a price of 760 yuan, Jinbao at 780 yuan, and Shuangying at 785 yuan, all lacked transactions.</p>
<h3>Small Zhenmei Tea Trading is Particularly Brisk - Export of Pulled-Core Zhenmei to Europe is Reviving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to the Tea Association's report, the green tea market was slightly clearer than last week, but the trading volume of small Zhenmei has been quite brisk in recent days. Yesterday, Xiehe continued to take in over 500 boxes, and Jinlong also slightly followed, with prices similar to before. Zhenmei trading was still sporadic, with Xiehe handling over 100 boxes of tea from the four famous brands, priced at 104 yuan. Baolong imported over 100 boxes of Huizhen, priced at 55 yuan and 65 yuan, and Jinlong imported over 100 boxes of pulled Zhenmei, priced at 106 to 110 yuan. Baitouhang continued to have transactions for Gongxi at 80 yuan. After large quantities of Pingshui tea were sold, the market became quiet last week, with only two batches traded throughout the week, making it the quietest period since the opening of large batches. The report yesterday that large batch trading was smooth was entirely rumored to be unemployed, and is hereby corrected.</p>
<p>Another interview draft stated that, previously, the export of Luzhuang pulled-core Zhenmei green tea had been sluggish due to the war in Morocco. Recently, European sales were said to be still smooth, and Chinese merchants have repeatedly reduced prices to seek sales, with market prices reducing by 20 to 30 yuan compared to before. As a result, the market has become very active. Yesterday, Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, Yongxing and other firms all had large purchases of high-quality goods from Wuyuan and Tunxi, with prices opening at 105 yuan. In addition, needle-shaped Mei tea and pearl tea were also quite popular. Shrimp-eye Mala pearl tea with excellent body was even raised by 2-3 yuan due to the shortage of goods. The green tea market has greatly improved compared to before.</p>
<h3>Dried &amp; Salted Goods - Golden Needles and Golden Vegetables Rebounded Sharply - Many Jujubes Arrived, and the Price Fell by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Golden Needles - Due to the firm defense of the numbers by the firms, the market has gradually improved and rebounded sharply. Yesterday, the top-grade vegetables opened at 24 yuan, followed by 23.5 yuan to 20.5 yuan, with ordinary vegetables slightly lower. A total of one hundred and several dozen packages were traded, an increase of 1-2 yuan. Market prices have also been raised, and if sales are strong, there may be further increases.</p>
<p>Jujubes - Recently, shipments have arrived from Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Lanxi, etc., and the market has been slightly soft, with a drop of about one yuan. For example, Hangjia, Su and Lanxi's Tutu are all selling for 34 yuan, and the secondary round Lanxi goods are selling for 32 yuan. The usual adjustments are still made.</p>
<p>Black Melon Seeds - Recently, due to the scarcity of arrivals, combined with the lack of inventory in the market and the rise in production prices, opening prices have also gradually increased. Yesterday, over three hundred pieces were opened, with Shuang Gouzi at 15 yuan, Gao Xu Kuizi at 14.6 yuan, secondary Zhuang at 13.6 yuan, and Mingguang Zi at 13.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Fufubai Ice Sugar's Next Batch is About to Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market trend remained flat and soft. The association's price for second grade coarse sand white spot goods was 21.7 yuan, and the re-export goods was 6.65 yuan. Dongbai also did not stabilize. Fourth grade white was priced at the original price, and the eighth grade YT mark was 21.13 yuan, with continued transactions. Re-export goods were 6.1 yuan. Ninth grade YR mark spot goods were 20.9 yuan, and re-export goods were 5.9 yuan, both down slightly by one jiao. Zhenji and Jinxin Dahua's first grade white was 20.5 yuan, and the rest were discounted. Number goods, Qing, Chi, and Bai, all demanded the original price and were unwilling to ease up, resulting in a lack of continued opening. Standard Fufubai ice sugar has been in short supply for a long time. Yesterday, the firm telegraphed that the next batch has already been loaded and is en route, and prices are expected to be stable. Yesterday, the Taiyuan ship arrived from Xiamen and Taiwan with 862 bags of brown sugar and 13 bags of white sugar. (Yesterday's report stated that the Hainan Chi price was 13.56 yuan, which was mistakenly written as 12.56 yuan. This is hereby corrected.)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Sales of Cotton Cloth Diminish - Factory Prices Also Appear Soft</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market, influenced by the continuous weakness in yarn and cotton prices and the decrease in cloth sales, fell one after another. Coarse cloths of 16 pounds and 15 pounds from local factories fell by 2.5 to 5 fen per bolt. The prices of light and heavy weight cloths from Jardine Matheson and light weight cloths from local factories remained the same. Fine cloth and fine twill from local factories also fell by about 5 fen per bolt. Although Dong goods fine cloth and fine twill Shibu 84 cloth have been falling for many days, as the end of the month approaches, there are continued low prices, falling by 2.5 fen to 5 fen per bolt compared to the previous day. Printed finished goods prices were still stable. Colored cloth and colored twill also fell by about one jiao per bolt. Japanese firms listed Qingdao Gongda Rong, Shuanglongzhu fine cloth, 13.5 pound Shuanglongzhu coarse cloth, and Dakang Factory Wufu Jixiang fine cloth, and Toyota Factory Labashi fine cloth, and Jian Shuangyu fine twill. The quantities of various goods were sporadic, totaling only over one hundred pieces. Factory prices also appeared soft. News of Chinese factory white goods was even more silent. However, autumn and winter Chinese and foreign colored goods and finished goods were still in demand due to the lack of production from factories, and most were for the delivery of ordered goods, so the market was able to hold its ground. Yesterday, small amounts of colored goods from Beibang Changjiang inland routes were shipped, and goods from Changzhou and Wuxi were not quiet.</p>
<h3>Metals - Egg Factory Assistance Thrives - Two Hundred Pounds of American Tinplate</h3>
<p>Two hundred pounds of Citibank tinplate is a necessity for egg factories. Recently, as the weather has turned cooler, local egg factories have already started cracking eggs and baking, so the demand for tinplate has suddenly increased. Therefore, in recent days, there have been 400-500 cases. As overseas prices have been reported to rise, local market conditions have also been firm. For example, No. 1 goods from the Zheng brand are estimated at 45 yuan, No. 2 goods from the Zheng brand are estimated at 44 yuan, and No. 3 goods from the Zheng brand are priced at 42.5 yuan. In addition, a kind of "wild chicken" goods can also be priced at 42 yuan. It is heard that customers in other cities have also been inquiring in recent days.</p>
<h3>Sundries　Red and White Peels Already Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Due to a lack of continuous replenishment of Haikou red peels, the market has been experiencing a shortage. It was heard yesterday that shipping companies have transported over a dozen pieces here. As the demand from distributors is extremely high, prices for Sha Red Peels and Baishui Qing have uniformly increased, showing a positive trend. Market price:</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>There is a question that hovers in the minds of many of our young people: "Is love something we need?" In fact, if a friend embarks on the path of love and possesses the perseverance to control their environment, they can be considered exceptional. However, the outcome often fails to escape the circle of煩惱(troubles).</p>
<p>The more comfortable one becomes, the more comfort one seeks, and thus laziness surrounds them. We travel on the road of life, with thorns ahead, but life is about struggle. Ignoring the pain of the thorns on our feet, we strive forward. At this moment, there is a beautiful flower blooming with a smiling face by the roadside. Then you immediately become surprised, "I didn't expect that in such a desert-like land, there would be flowers that could comfort my melancholy!" So, from appreciation, to admiration, to plucking it. At this time, you not only forget the pain of the thorns on your feet, but also halt your progress. However, when the flower withers, that is when your pain multiplies. Because you first obtained the comfort of ease, unconsciously forming a habit of laziness, then you have no courage to fight for the difficult future. Instead, they say that everything in society is hypocritical, and what value does a person's life have? Naturally, they fall!</p>
<p>If, in the midst of melancholy, one can obtain a "解語花" (a flower that understands speech) to moisten their dry life and slightly change the environment before them, their spirit will naturally be excited. Under this excitement, if they continue to rush towards their future, singing a song of victory, then everything about them will have a great effect!</p>
<p>Therefore, my conclusion is: love can only be used as a stimulant to excite a melancholy spirit, not as a piece of bread to satisfy hunger. Otherwise, you will definitely be poisoned and die! Moreover, there are many things that our young people need to do right now. Where do we have the free time to indulge in this pink-colored longing!</p>
<h3>The Virtue and Grace of Poet Hu Shiyu and His Wife</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>My teacher, Mr. Hu Shiyu, is from Peng Town in Kunshan. He is devoted to learning and practices frugality, admired throughout the country. Along with Gao Chuiwan of Jinshan and Qian Mingshan of Changzhou, he is known as one of the "Three Great Confucian Scholars of Jiangnan." His mother, Madam Cao, was known in the village for her virtuous character. She wore simple clothes and ate simple meals, but she worried about not helping people enough. Two miles northwest of the town, there is a place called Crane Neck Bay. The stone bridge there was destroyed during the Xianfeng era of the Qing Dynasty and was replaced with wood, which was also decayed and broken. Those who carried firewood and vegetables had to take a detour to pass. For thirty years, there were no funds to repair it. Madam Cao wanted to use her private savings to hire workers, but she passed away before she could do so. Therefore, her sons opened her chest and examined the remaining money while weeping, wishing to build this bridge to fulfill their mother's wish. The villagers praised her lasting love and named it "Madam Hu Bridge." An elder named Jin Hewang wrote a record for it and engraved it in stone. Last year, my teacher suffered from erysipelas, and his face and head suddenly swelled, losing all sensation. He was in extremely critical condition. Thanks to the careful treatment of Dr. Chen Zhaochang of Shanghai Hospital, he was able to recover. However, one of his feet was crippled and he had difficulty walking. He had a bamboo sedan chair made, and whenever he recited poetry softly, he would order his servant to carry him to the hibiscus fence and flower garden to enjoy the scenery. Sometimes, he would lean on a dragon-headed cane and, in the slanting sunlight, supervise one or two workers weeding and trimming grass, his old age still full of interest. He often enjoyed exchanging letters and discussing poetry and prose with friends and disciples. Because his hands trembled, his handwriting was crooked, adding to its antique charm. The Guohua Middle School on Gordon Road in Shanghai is renowned for promoting Chinese studies. My teacher donated one thousand yuan to help it as a scholarship fund and invited contemporary literary figures, such as Yan Duhe, Zhou Shoujuan, Gao Chuiwan, Ye Chucang, Hu Puan, Liu Yazi, and Wu Qianan, to serve as graders of the papers. My teacher wrote letters to each of these gentlemen to express his gratitude. I once saw his letter to Chuiwan, which briefly stated: "It has been a long time since I received your instruction, and I often think of you. My hand still trembles and has not fully recovered, and the dampness in my left foot is terribly painful. I am bored in bed, so I wrote a poem to Mr. and your worthy sons each, and I will send them in a painted frame after the autumn cools down. I have recorded the poems below to present to you: 'Two hundred miles apart, not seen for years, a sick old man in a stream house, a hermit poet in a mountain villa, your poetry is refined in the furnace, my painting is frosty and snowy, eagerly awaiting the sound of feathers, boating on the Ming Lake, passing down family learning, how many young people are there now? Letting the younger brothers go out, waiting for the strict parents to work, Jianghai repays friends, literature sweeps away vulgarity, the long sky is clear in autumn, looking eastward to the sea.' Also, I have slightly helped the scholarship fund of Shanghai Guohua Middle School, and there is still the matter of asking you to grade the papers fairly. Principal Wang Yuzhang of Guohua will add a letter to explain it. I hope you will not refuse. I am fortunate to know this in detail because I have recently been teaching at Guohua School."</p>
<h3>The Waibaidu Bridge</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>The Waibaidu Bridge in Shanghai can truly be considered one of the most important places in the Public Concession. All those who come to Shanghai from the interior to sightsee, after playing at the Great World, strolling through the City God Temple, climbing to the top of the International Hotel, and paying their respects to the battlefield in Zhabei, must inevitably come to appreciate the Waibaidu Bridge. The Waibaidu Bridge, also known as the Outer Ferry Bridge, is a long and wide iron bridge facing the Huangpu River and spanning the Suzhou Creek. From the surface of the Huangpu River or the Suzhou Creek, looking at it from afar, it truly has the appearance of a "long bridge lying on the waves." How much this "long bridge lying on the waves" weighs and how much it can carry, I am sorry I cannot report. However, since the birth of this bridge, countless wheels and countless feet have passed over it every day, going from south to north and from north to south. Even now, it still lies quietly, tirelessly connecting north and south traffic. Its great endurance can be seen from this.</p>
<p>According to those familiar with Shanghai anecdotes, when the Shanghai Concession was first established, there was not only no large iron bridge at the original site of the Waibaidu Bridge, but there was not even a single-plank bridge. At that time, the only means of transportation between north and south were a few square-headed wooden ferry boats. Therefore, at that time, the place was called "Ferry Crossing." Later, the Concession authorities raised funds to build this large iron bridge, and the general public named it "Ferry Bridge." Initially, vehicles and pedestrians had to pay a "bridge toll" to pass through the bridge. Later, this practice was abolished, so the Shanghai people called it "Baidu Bridge," meaning that one could cross over it without paying a toll. Subsequently, the Zhapu Road Bridge was also built, so everyone called the Zhapu Road Bridge the "Inner Baidu Bridge" and honored the iron-cast Baidu Bridge as the "Outer Baidu Bridge."</p>
<p>One end of the Waibaidu Bridge is connected to the bustling center of Shanghai—the Bund, and the other end leads to the vast Hongkou area, no less than a major throat. On both sides of the bridge stand consulates of various countries, and even more well-known both at home and abroad is the Bund Park, a place that once "forbade dogs and Chinese from entering," now open to the public, located right at the southern end of the bridge, attracting high-class men and women, both Chinese and foreign, from Shanghai all winter, summer, day, and night. Therefore, the Waibaidu Bridge is etched even more deeply in the minds of the general public.</p>
<p>If the Jinpu Railway is the backbone of transportation between north and south in our country, promoting the development of culture, finance, military affairs, industry, and other aspects, then I feel that the Waibaidu Bridge bears a similar mission for Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Mated Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Double Happiness Arrives, Poem Inscribed on Emerald Leaves; Wedding Dress Surprises as Tried On, Tears Wet the Silk Shawl</p>
<p>Madam Jiang smiled and said, "Even if it's done, you don't have to wear it out right now. It's just to let you try it on." Menglan said, "I'm not wearing it now, what's the point of me trying it on?" Madam Jiang looked at her own daughter, then at the bundles on the bed, thinking to herself, isn't this child being deliberate? With her intelligence, what doesn't she know? So she said, "This isn't my idea either. Your father said that since we have this material, we shouldn't leave it idle at home, so let's make it. After it's made, we can't try it on right away. Trying it on and then putting it away will also set our minds at ease. Because if it doesn't fit, we can have the tailor take it to alter it. You try it on now." As she spoke, she picked up the clothes and walked towards Menglan. With the clothes in her hands, she kept them hanging, not letting go, and looked at Menglan with a constant smile. Menglan saw her mother standing in front of her, acting like a maid serving a young lady. If she completely ignored her, it would be disrespectful to her elder. So she frowned and said, "Mom, why are you in such a hurry? Just give it to me to wear." So she took the clothes and reached out to put them in the sleeves. Madam Jiang grabbed her hand and said, "You can't put on clothes like that. You have to take off the clothes you're wearing before you can put this on." Menglan held the new clothes in her hands for a moment, then nodded and said, "I'll do whatever you say." So she went into the tent and changed her upper body jacket. She lifted the tent and smiled with a frown, "Do you think this looks like a country bumpkin?" Madam Jiang looked her up and down and nodded, "It fits very well. Why don't you just put on the skirt and see how it looks?" Menglan said, "Is there anything wrong with the skirt? There's no need to try it on." Madam Jiang didn't say anything else, but went forward herself, unfolded the folded skirt, held the waistband in both hands, and came to Menglan to tie it on her. Menglan dodged and smiled, "I'm not a three- or two-year-old little girl. You serving me like this is embarrassing me, isn't it?" Madam Jiang said, "Then you put it on yourself." As she spoke, she held the waistband in both hands and still brought it forward. Menglan first sighed deeply, then smiled again. Then she took the skirt and bent over to tie it on herself. She smiled and said, "I'm being obedient in every way, doing what you want, Mom, what else do you want?" Madam Jiang smiled and said, "Why do you always sound angry when you talk?" Menglan didn't say anything, but slowly walked back and forth between the curtains, then looked at Madam Jiang and said, "Have you seen enough, Mom? I can take it off now." Madam Jiang took two steps back, sat on the chair, and looked at her for a long time. (66)</p>
<h3>What I Saw at Jiangwan Bookstore</h3>
<p>— (Qian Xiaoshan)</p>
<p>Under the blazing sun, the ground is covered in a thousand rays of light. An old woman returns from the field, bent over and still carrying a hoe. I ask her how old she is, eighty plus. Old and shouldn't you rest a little, for your stomach and family, there is no store. Your hair is still not white, from a long time, this principle is not false.</p>
<h3>A Record of Unique Skills with Mouth and Nose</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>A few years ago, I saw a performer display his unique skills at a friend's wedding banquet, which made me admire him immensely. What he performed was not some elaborate magic trick that relied solely on tools, but all kinds of exquisite and lively little tricks. However, although they were said to be small tricks, they all relied on his true skill and true ability, without any pretense. His mouth and nose could all help him perform, creating all kinds of patterns. The most interesting thing was that he folded a piece of white paper into a funnel shape with a pointed end and a flat opening, stood it on the tip of his nose, tilted his head back, and spun around a few times. Then he struck a match and started burning it at the opening of the funnel. After a while, the fire had burned away half of the funnel, while the lower half still stood on his nose, without moving at all. Later, it was completely burned to ashes before he ended the trick. Then he supported a small square table with four wooden sticks, put the four stick legs together, and lifted his head to hold them in his mouth. This was not all. He lit four small table lamps and placed them on the table, and in the middle, he put a phonograph, and the Western music record played softly and melodiously. I watched from the side and couldn't help but sweat for him, thinking that the weight on his mouth must be at least several dozen pounds? If it fell, it would be a big disaster. Who knew that he didn't care at all. He also picked up a moon lute in his hand and plucked the strings lightly and casually, playing a Moonlight Serenade from Honolulu, which harmonized well with the Western music in the phonograph record, which was very pleasant to listen to. I didn't expect this clever person to show off his skills. While his mouth was carrying such a heavy burden, he still made sounds in his mouth, beating time for the tune. This made people admire him immensely, and the applause shook the roof tiles. After a tune was over, he put down the moon lute and personally took down the small table lamps and the phonograph from the table one by one. Then he removed the four wooden sticks, pressed on the table with both hands, bowed, and retreated. I saw that this performer's performance was all about working on the center of gravity. He simply understood the theory of the center of gravity in physics very well. It would not be wrong to call him a physicist-performer. Admiring him, I went up to ask him his honorable name. He gave me a business card, which clearly read Qian Bingzhang.</p>
<p>These years, I have been running around for food and clothing, without any desire for entertainment. It has been several years since I saw Qian Bingzhang's unique skills. Yesterday, I read the advertisement for the Sincere Amusement Park in the local supplement of Shen Bao and knew that he was performing at the amusement park. A scholar should be looked at with new eyes after three days of separation, let alone after a few years of separation? I think his mouth and nose skills must have made amazing progress, and he must be able to come up with more new tricks.</p>
<p>Short News: The famous painter Tao Lengyue held an exhibition of paintings in Wumen in early summer. People from the three Wu areas all scrambled to see it quickly. However, Mr. Tao rarely paints fan faces. Therefore, those who like to collect fan faces all regret that they have not obtained a fan painted by Mr. Tao. Now, a friend in Shanghai has asked him to paint one hundred leaves each of landscape and flower fan faces, taking half the price for the painting, six yuan per flower face (original price twelve yuan) and twelve yuan per landscape face (original price twenty-four yuan). The current quota has already reached one hundred pieces. For the convenience of purchasers, he has specially entrusted the manager of Rongbaozhai on Henan Road to display them. Locals can go to choose and purchase in person, and people from other places can remit the painting fee to Tao Lengyue's painting studio at No. 4 Tongyi Lane, Beile Road, and they can get a fan painted by Mr. Tao (fan face included). However, if the quota is full, the original price will still be charged.</p>

<h3>Common Knowledge About Air Defense</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Knowledge of air defense has become a necessary common sense for citizens in times of emergency. Therefore, all countries often practice air defense drills, in addition to examining the effectiveness of air defense plans, it is also to practically train citizens on how to deal with enemy aircraft attacks. On July 20, the three cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kawasaki in Japan jointly conducted a large-scale air defense drill, which took four days. The people were very able to show that their knowledge of air defense was not lacking. Looking back at our country, there are still many places where even light control has not been tested.</p>
<p>Air forces always use night attacks as the majority, the most effective of course is air defense, wiping them out halfway. Therefore, the construction of airfields is very important. In large cities, one hundred anti-aircraft guns are distributed, as well as searchlights that hinder enemy aircraft, but it is always inevitable that they can be forced through. For example, in front of sixteen anti-aircraft guns, forty aircraft come, and as many as eight can be forced to intrude. An aircraft can carry a thousand incendiary bombs, so how will the fire trucks in the city cope? The heat of incendiary bombs is about 3,000 degrees, and even steel can be melted. A one-wa bomb is five or six inches in diameter. The largest is twenty watts, and the smallest is only two hundred watts. The Soviet Union announced that ten aircraft can carry 50,000 incendiary bombs. As a result, 9,000 places caught fire, and the others fell in non-fire-prone places, such as roads, parks, and rivers. In this way, within five square kilometers, there are 50,000 bombs, averaging one bomb for every 100 square meters, which is a direct hit.</p>
<p>According to the example of the European War, London used aircraft to defend against air raids, while Paris used anti-aircraft guns. As a result, London shot down more enemy aircraft, but Paris reduced street damage. Britain was attacked by aircraft sixty-three times, and by airships fifty-three times, with 4,821 deaths and injuries. Paris, on the other hand, counted only four six attacks with only about 900 deaths and injuries. Because Britain had no defense methods against the attacks of the Zeppelins.</p>
<p>Poison gas is also a powerful weapon for destroying cities. The gas masks used by the public only cost six yuan each in Japan, and the best ones have the army's seal. The ones used by the army are manufactured by the Chemical Research Institute. The main agent in the gas mask is activated carbon, wrapped in felt. In an emergency, wood charcoal scraps and cotton can also be used, placed in a beer bottle without a bottom. Its effectiveness can only last for a few minutes to several minutes and cannot be called completely effective. The safest thing is to close the house and transform it into a gas-proof residence. Gas masks are only for temporary use when going out.</p>
<p>Five- or six-story wooden houses are easily destroyed by bombs. In large three-story steel-reinforced concrete houses, you can be safe in the basement. The underground passages dug in the Soviet-Shanghai area are probably not very effective under two-story wooden houses. If you don't open up tunnels to the outside, it is even more dangerous. Ordinary houses in our country cannot be said to be bomb-proof. Apart from building dozens of public air-raid shelters, there may not be a first-aid method.</p>

<h3>The Extent to Which Indulgence Harms "Health" and "Lifespan"</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Shiying</p>
<p>Most people believe that the union of husband and wife is for procreation, but in addition to this, there are three other major functions. On an individual level, first, it can satisfy personal sexual desires, second, it can provide a kind of personality adjustment, and third, it can make the fate of the race permanent. In summary, it can be proved that marriage has a great impact on individuals and society. I see that young people nowadays often cannot thoroughly understand the union of husband and wife and cannot use an appropriate and regulated life to realize these three major functions. Before marriage, they engage in excessive masturbation; after marriage, they indulge in sex without restraint. Therefore, their sexual demands have exceeded the limit. Due to the excessive consumption of energy, their spirits decline, their muscles become thin, and they even lose the health of their reproductive glands. All parts of their bodies are greatly hindered, and their health loses its guarantee. Because at this time, the body's blood production is in a normal state, but indulgence without restraint causes excessive consumption of essence and blood, reduces red blood cells, reduces hemoglobin, and greatly threatens the ability to promote metabolism. This is only a slight comparison. There is an even more important relationship, which is the lack of reproductive gland hormone - endocrine. Because sexual desire is generated by endocrine stimulation from the glands and by the reflexive emotions generated by the accumulation of glandular fluid. Therefore, if indulgence is excessive, the secretions produced by the reproductive glands are consumed excessively, and the body and mind are greatly oppressed, which will inevitably lead to abnormal health and shortened lifespan.</p>
<p>Patient Feng Mingde, 23 years old, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, started his sexual life at the age of 17 and indulged in it at will without restraint. As a result of six years of indulgence, his essence was greatly damaged, his face was haggard, his hair was thinning, he had nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, and a hundred diseases arose. This was due to the severe destruction of his reproductive glands, and the new blood produced physiologically was completely exhausted. This spring, he was introduced by a fellow patient to take the pure reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin," which immediately presented a picture of abundant spirit and strong physique. After taking four boxes in a row, premature ejaculation and impotence were completely cured. At the same time, nocturnal emission was also cured by taking "Hemet's Semen-Consolidating Tablets."</p>
<h3>The Most Reliable Good Method for Self-Treatment of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Wu Dachao, Bachelor of Medicine, Hong Kong Medical University</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is the most stubborn and difficult-to-treat venereal disease, which no one can deny. Therefore, although thousands of treatments for gonorrhea have been introduced, they still cannot completely eliminate the disease. However, some people miss the opportunity for treatment and become worse. Others do not take care of themselves properly, forming a lingering and incurable condition. In addition to these, most are misled by medicine. Because if gonorrhea can be treated in the acute phase along the right path, without delaying the time, it can be treated quickly with "Antigon," which is made of yellow pigment and vaccine. Because "Antigon" contains many germ vaccines that resist gonococci, and yellow pigment has a great ability to penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, it can wipe out all the gonococci clustered in the urinary and reproductive organs and various parts, eliminating the danger of its complications. Understanding that treatment in the acute phase is a great opportunity for radical cure recognized by the medical community is essential. However, this opportunity is fleeting. If you miss it, it will become chronic, and there is also the danger of becoming orchitis, cystitis, arthritis, etc.</p>
<p>Patient He Kerun, 28 years old, suffered from chronic gonorrhea, which he said he had had for two years. He had frequent urination, and his urine was not very cloudy, indicating that Mr. He had posterior urethritis. In the middle of last month, after being introduced by a friend to take "Antigon," his gonorrhea symptoms gradually improved. After taking five boxes, the turbidity stopped and the urine cleared. The other day, he came to me for examination and was completely cured. I asked him what medicine he had used to cure it, and he began to tell me the details as above.</p>
<p>Knowledge for Couples</p>
<p>— Yao Erchang, MD, Ben Sveni University, USA</p>
<h3>Reasons for Infertility and Treatments for Sexual Dysfunction</h3>
<p>…Please pay attention to methods for remedying physical and pathological conditions of important organs… …How to enhance sexual function to increase happiness for the future of couples… …Clarify the relationship between the decline of the gonads and this condition, as well as human development</p>
<p>An introduction to physiological knowledge regarding the lives of couples is presented in a well-organized manner. However, due to limitations of space and other reasons, we regret that we cannot provide a detailed account to our readers. We can briefly describe some of the more important aspects of pregnancy knowledge necessary for couples themselves and methods for remedying sexual dysfunction. Many readers, even when seeing this practical knowledge, may be amazed as if it were a miracle. However, we want to use written guidance to provide reasonable solutions to the shortcomings of every couple. Diseases that ordinary people consider untreatable should be brought under control through our discussions. Therefore, we eagerly hope that scientists and medical experts will occupy more space in our discussions.</p>
<p>For the overall well-being of couples, we hope that future young people will pay special attention to their bodies and important organs before marriage, ensuring that they are strong and healthy. Should they have any hidden illnesses? They should also know how to conceive children and produce healthy offspring. Men must have fully developed bodies with strong and sturdy physiques and muscles in order to produce excellent sperm. Therefore, young people who have the bad habit of masturbation or suffer from nocturnal emissions, venereal diseases, or incomplete development, those who are weakened by early marriage or excessive sexual activity after marriage, men who have premature ejaculation, impotence, or neurasthenia, and women who have irregular menstruation, underdeveloped breasts, weak bodies, or lack of pregnancy function must seek practical treatment methods. They should seek appropriate treatment based on their constitution and the source of their illness. For those who have sexual dysfunction due to physical weakness, incomplete development, or excessive sexual activity after marriage, the focus of remedy should be on their gonads, and they must not allow them to decline. It is precisely because of this decline that these pathological conditions arise. Therefore, they should take the gonadal hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element). Women can take the female version of "Sheng Zhi Su" to restore their development and enlarge their breasts. The most obvious effect is the regulation of menstruation, which eliminates obstacles to the uterus, enhances the ability to become pregnant, and ensures that pregnancy is no longer a problem. In addition, for those whose sperm gates are loose and semen is thin due to prolonged nocturnal emissions, they should also take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets) to strengthen the sperm gates. Or for those who have premature ejaculation or impotence due to gonorrhea, "Sheng Zhi Su" is indeed an appropriate and effective medicine. At the same time, the gonorrhea should be treated with "An Di Lin" (Anti-Lymph), a gonorrhea treatment drug made of yellow pigment and vaccine preparations, because "An Di Lin" has a very strong ability to resist bacteria and has a great and effective medicinal power that penetrates membranes and kills bacteria, achieving the goal of thorough cure. Only in this way can both sexes equally enjoy the true and deep pleasure of married life.</p>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company Building, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road (Consultation Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>(1) Underdevelopment and Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Tinghui, from Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, 24 years old. (Chief Complaint) – Has had the bad habit of masturbation since the age of fifteen, and still cannot completely quit it. Therefore, he suffered damage during development, and his penis and testicles are very small. He also has nocturnal emissions every two days, and his mind is easily fatigued with poor memory.

After about two months, the neurasthenia and nocturnal emissions were completely cured, his spirit gradually became refreshed, his muscles also became particularly plump, and his appetite improved with weight gain. He was completely different from before the treatment.</p>
<p>(2) Treatment of Phimosis and Premature Ejaculation</p>
<p>Patient Zeng Xueming, from Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, engaged in the department store business, 24 years old this year. (Chief Complaint) – Due to early marriage, his development was greatly hindered, and he has a long foreskin. Even when using his fingers to retract the foreskin, the glans cannot be exposed. There is only a small hole at the front of the foreskin. When urinating, the urine first enters the space between the foreskin and the glans before being discharged from the foreskin. The same happens during ejaculation, so he feels extremely uncomfortable. His erections are frequent. After marrying at the age of eighteen, due to excessive sexual desire, he developed premature ejaculation in less than a year, and could not have complete sexual intercourse. He has recently been experiencing nocturnal emissions. When he is under stress at work, the seminal fluid can even leak out in public. During the day, he also feels palpitations and night sweats, and at night he suffers from insomnia and headaches. With slight exertion, he feels weak in his limbs, mentally exhausted, and extremely depressed. (Present Symptoms) – Low blood pressure, hyperactive reflex function, atrophied prostate that cannot be felt, phimosis, and a high degree of neurasthenia, gastric atony, dilated spermatic cord, weight of only 88 pounds, sensitivity to cold, and aversion to annoyance. (Treatment Methods) – First, local anesthesia is applied, and a small portion of the constricted ring at the tip of the foreskin is cut off to form a ring, and then sutured. Cooling, electrotherapy, "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) is used to enhance its development and replenish its essence and blood. At the same time, "Xi Mi Ni Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets) is used to consolidate his sperm gates and cure his nocturnal emission. After about two weeks of treatment, his body gradually became stronger, the nocturnal emissions completely stopped, his mind was clear, and his sexual function was enhanced. Only in his forties, all his illnesses were gone, and his weight reached 101 pounds.</p>
<p>Common Sense for Self-Treatment</p>
<h3>The Harms of Masturbation and Radical Cure of Nocturnal Emissions</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Peripheral mechanical masturbation, spiritual masturbation, the extent of damage to the nerve center caused by nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Masturbation is a very common bad habit among young people, both male and female. However, the results vary significantly depending on the individual's age, physique, and the extent of the behavior. Generally, when a young person is adversely affected by masturbation, it is necessary to correct the bad habit and provide complete treatment at an early stage.</p>
<p>The effects of masturbation are generally recognized as: high degree of neurasthenia, weak physique, gastrointestinal disorders, underdevelopment of the genitals, etc. In addition, the most obvious symptom of the disease is frequent nocturnal emissions, which is almost a necessary symptom for those who have a masturbation habit. Therefore, people with nocturnal emissions inevitably suffer from neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Masturbation methods vary depending on gender and individual, but they are generally divided into two types: one is the method of stimulating the local area, and the other is the method of striving for mental meditation to reach a certain climax. The former can also be called peripheral mechanical stimulation, and the latter can also be called spiritual masturbation. Both are harmful.</p>
<p>The most obvious symptom after masturbation is the frequency of nocturnal emissions, which has already been mentioned before. For example, a patient named Shen Yiru, a junior high school student, 17 years old, developed nocturnal emissions, forgetfulness, headaches, palpitations, tinnitus, etc., due to the bad habit of masturbation. In May of this year, he was introduced by his relative Xia Qiusheng to take "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets). After taking the tablets, his sperm gates were consolidated and the nocturnal emissions stopped. Initially, it was a trial, but after taking one box, he felt that his dreams had decreased and the nocturnal emissions had stopped. He then took three boxes in a row. Three months have passed, and he has never had a nocturnal emission. From this, we know that the method of treatment must focus on addressing the root cause. Therefore, the sperm gates should be consolidated. Once the sperm gates are consolidated, the semen will not leak, the mind will be firm, and dreams and meditation will be eliminated. Therefore, "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (Schmidt's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets) is indeed the best medicine for patients with nocturnal emissions. Because Shen felt that he had neurasthenia after nocturnal emissions, he also took "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element) at the same time. After taking it, he immediately felt refreshed and his body was strengthened, which he had never experienced before.</p>
<p>Common Knowledge about Bone Pain</p>
<h3>The Relationship between Bone Pain, Kidney Deficiency, and Blood Quality</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>The main causes of bone pain are scattered in various medical journals and magazines. The focus of discussion is mostly on internal dampness, unclean blood quality, and weakened resistance due to aging. Indeed, these are important causes of bone pain. However, excessive uric acid and kidney deficiency due to excessive indulgence in sexual activity will inevitably lead to bone pain. In addition, arteriosclerosis will inevitably lead to stroke, sudden collapse, and hemiplegia due to bone pain. Therefore, those who suffer from bone pain must choose medicines that have the medicinal power to treat the above-mentioned conditions, and that have the functions of soothing the muscles and collaterals, clarifying the blood, dispelling wind and cold, relieving pain and reducing swelling, and that must also have the ability to assist the body's overall resistance in order to overcome the illness. For example, recently there was a patient named Mr. Zheng, who was 38 years old. In his early years, he frequented brothels, and due to the nature of his job, he traveled long distances, enduring wind and cold, resulting in internal dampness. For the past three years, he often felt soreness in his waist and back. Although he had taken medicine for treatment, it was ineffective because the medicine was not suitable for his condition. Last winter, his illness worsened. He even experienced hand and foot cramps, muscle and tendon pain, and numbness in his limbs during pain. When the illness was severe, he was unable to move, no different from hemiplegia. He was introduced by a fellow patient to take "Qiang Si Deng Shi Gu Tong Pian" (Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets). After taking them, his condition improved and the pain was relieved. At first, he only felt that his muscles and collaterals were soothed and his bones were relaxed. Later, he could move as usual. Even after working for a long time, he no longer felt soreness in his waist and back. Mr. Zheng is an old friend of mine. Fearing that the illness would recur in the future, he came to me to inquire whether the medicine he took was suitable for his condition. I have long known that "Qiang Si Deng Shi Gu Tong Pian" (Johnston's Bone Pain Tablets) is most effective in treating bone pain and have used it for a long time to treat this condition. There have never been any recurrences. Therefore, I guarantee the effectiveness of its medicine and the greatness of its effect. Mr. Zheng then thanked me and left with peace of mind.</p>
<h3>New Record of Successful Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>— Dr. Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Although there are many methods for quitting smoking, they must be chosen and applied according to the person, and they must go through a certain period of time and experience various pains. If the medicine is not appropriate, it will still fail halfway. Therefore, for addicts, quitting smoking is considered the most painful task. So they would rather endure suffering, stimulation, and bankruptcy to satisfy their smoking amount. They also know that smoking is degenerate and unhappy, but because of the control of anesthesia, they have no choice. Now that medicine is advancing, the methods for quitting smoking are constantly improving. Looking at the following smoking cessation process, we can know that the difficult problem has been shattered by the facts.</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Wang Mingzhen and his wife, from Haizhou, were 45 or 46 years old. Due to smoking for too long, their faces were sallow and bloodless. Apart from skin and bones, their bodies had no muscles, and their spirits were sluggish and weak. Therefore, although they had quit smoking three times before, they all failed halfway because they could not endure the pain during quitting. They had no choice but to resume smoking for relief. This spring, they were introduced by their relatives to use the tonic smoking cessation method, taking "Sheng Zhi Su" (Reproductive Element), a gonadal hormone preparation for men and women, to increase their overall resistance. On the one hand, they reduced their smoking amount. On the other hand, they generated a new energy to eliminate the various pains caused by quitting smoking. Therefore, when the couple quit, they did not feel the slightest discomfort. At the same time, their appetite increased, their complexion became ruddy, their spirits were strong, and their weight gradually increased. In just five weeks, they completely eradicated their many years of smoking addiction. They have been smoke-free for six months now. Those who don't know them would never know that the couple used to be a pair of black-listed addicts.</p>

<p>Talking Point</p>
<h3>The Path to "Seeking True Freedom"</h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>The newspapers of the 21st carried a Tianjin telegram from Hualian News Agency on the 20th, saying: "In Shihe, Eastern Hebei Pseudo-Area, a People's Self-Defense Army against Yin is discovered, with about a thousand people, all in plain clothes, armed with rifles and Mauser pistols. They have now divided into teams and gone to Funing, Luanxian, Zunhua, Yutian and other places to publicize the expulsion of Yin and contact local militias, using their own guns and strong young men to expand their strength, overthrow the traitor Yin by force, and seek true freedom. The people and militiamen in various places are mostly moved. In recent days, many people have voluntarily joined, and the momentum is growing. The traitor Yin has telegraphed the special police team under his command to search and kill them strictly. At the same time, Yin realized that the old subordinates of Zhang Qingyun and Zhang Yantian had unstable mutiny tendencies, and planned to reorganize them this month."</p>
<p>This news is very simple, but it brings great excitement. I don't know what others feel when they read this telegram, but I was greatly moved.</p>
<p>The sounds of "friendship," "cooperation," and "adjustment" are ringing in our "ears," while acts of aggression, both soft and hard, in the form of military force, economy, culture... are also in front of our "eyes." We do not "judge with our ears," we "listen to their words and observe their actions." As a result, we will certainly not mistake arsenic for honey. Although the enemy hands us "sugar-coated poison" with one hand, the other hand is holding a bright, sharp knife, ready to use it when we refuse their demands. But will that scare us?</p>
<p>The facts of the past few years have clearly answered this point. Under the so-called "benevolence and power combined" of "royal way" and "killing," aren't the volunteers who refuse to be slaves active in the Black Mountains and White Waters? Moreover, in the past few years, in difficult and arduous circumstances, relying solely on their hot blood and earthen guns, haven't they already made the "puppet" and "friendly army" mobilize and run around, restless all day long?</p>
<p>Can some threats make us bow our heads? Can it make us obediently swallow the poison and perish in the enemy's laughter, perishing without resistance!</p>
<p>In this way, in order to survive, it is not surprising that the people of the Pseudo-Area organize the People's Self-Defense Army to "seek true freedom" by "armed force," and that "many people have voluntarily joined in recent days." And on this point, we can confirm what kind of life the people of the Pseudo-Area are living.</p>
<p>I think the line of "seeking true freedom" with "armed force" is correct, and only this road can "seek true freedom." Otherwise, "you reason with the other party, but they use force to solve it. How can a scholar reason with a soldier?" However, there are two things that must be paid attention to in "seeking true freedom" with "armed force." One is not to forget that you are the people, and this struggle is for ourselves, not for the "winner takes all" "king" who "replaces" us. The second is that we should understand that the foundation of victory is built on unity. If we want to compete for credit or be heroes, we will be defeated by the enemy one by one. Moreover, if the unity is not strong, or if there is only unity among a few people, we will still fail. — Naturally, under the common enemy, I say this is somewhat like worrying about something that is unlikely to happen. And I hope this is worrying about something that is unlikely to happen.</p>
<h3>Anchoring in Hong Kong at Night</h3>
<p>— Xia Lisi</p>
<p>This is truly a sentimental journey.</p>
<p>It was dusk when the ship entered the harbor. The gray sky, the green sea, and the rustling of the waves stirred the traveler's emotions. My uncle Qiu—a kind and generous travel companion—and I stood together on the deck, leaning on the railings and looking at the green mountains on both sides. We allowed the sorrow of parting and resentment to grow continuously in our hearts, and we were silent. The sky grew darker, and the sound of the waves became clearer. The ship's whistle suddenly sounded, awakening us from our dreamlike trance.</p>
<p>"We're almost in Hong Kong," Uncle Qiu said.</p>
<p>"And we're about to part ways," I said.</p>
<p>"There is no banquet in life that does not end in separation," Uncle Qiu was obviously very reluctant to part, but he tried his best to hold back. "Even a flock of goats gets scattered..."</p>
<p>"Can't we prevent the goats from scattering? Can't good friendships disappear?"</p>
<p>"Separation is not the disappearance of friendship; on the contrary, it may be an opportunity to enhance friendship."</p>
<p>"I hope it really is like that!"</p>
<p>As we talked like this, we unconsciously reached the sea off Hong Kong, docking at the Kowloon Pier. The deck was suddenly busy: sailors running back and forth, hotel touts shouting out the names of their hotels. In this clamorous situation, Uncle Qiu prepared the disembarkation procedures, handed the luggage to the hotel people, and turned back.</p>
<p>I stood on the deck, staring blankly at the Hong Kong Peninsula on the opposite shore. The scattered lights on the hillside were so captivating. I, staring at the lights in a daze, was thinking about the creators of these colorful lights—a magnificent and admirable aspect of humanity's conquest of nature. Isn't it true that there is nothing that humanity's power cannot conquer? It's just that I am now bound by a difficult-to-resolve sorrow of parting, and restrained by the handcuffs of emotion. Turning my head, I saw that Uncle Qiu was still standing with me, facing the lights of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>What kind of world must be under those red and green lights! Hong Kong is unfamiliar to me, but I am familiar with Uncle Qiu. Uncle Qiu wanted me to accompany him ashore; the ship would not leave until dawn, and he would take care of me coming back. I agreed. I wanted to see what Hong Kong really looked like...</p>
<p>The small ferry took Uncle Qiu and me to the shore of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The seaside road in Hong Kong was quiet and clean, with the southern monsoon blowing at the end of July. Several rickshaws came over, soliciting business. But Uncle Qiu said:</p>
<p>"We should walk."</p>
<p>The roads in Hong Kong are not easy to walk; especially when walking up the slopes, it is a bit tiring. Uncle Qiu knew that we should find a place to rest; at this time we were a little hungry, so we went to a restaurant together.</p>
<p>I will never forget that delicate and charming waitress. Although I didn't know her name or anything about her, she warmed my heart during the journey. We drank cup after cup of double-distilled wine. The weather was still hot, and sweat kept pouring out. She turned on the electric fan and often brought us fragrant towels.</p>
<p>"Where are you two gentlemen going? To the provincial capital?" she asked in a gentle, melodious Cantonese.</p>
<p>"I teach here," Uncle Qiu replied, and pointed to me and said, "He is going to the provincial capital, as you said."</p>
<p>"The provincial capital is at its liveliest now—" she stood beside me, opening her eyes as if she saw a place she was familiar with, "Picking lychees in a small sampan, facing the stars on a summer night, you will feel an indescribable pleasure. Perhaps a walk along the Bund will make you feel that the world is not as gloomy as pessimists say..."</p>
<p>"What about Hong Kong? Why don't you miss Hong Kong?" I said.</p>
<p>"Because the banks of Lychee Bay have nurtured my youthful love... But now, sir, the evil hand of life has strangled my throat!"</p>
<p>We spent more than an hour in front of this eloquent waitress. When we left, I still cast her a nostalgic glance, and she smiled charmingly.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, why do I have to leave you?</p>
<p>At two o'clock that night, I still couldn't fall asleep, so I groped up from the cabin to the deck to bid farewell to this beautiful island. The lights had dimmed, leaving only a few sparse ones, flickering and smiling. At this time, I didn't know if Uncle Qiu had fallen asleep yet. And I thought of that delicate waitress. God, I am deeply blessing her!</p>
<h3>Sea and the Old Man</h3>
<p>— Luo Peng</p>
<p>One bright afternoon, I moved alone to this seaside to live in solitude. I love the sea: the sea has left too deep an impression on me. It can agitate my nerves and even make me melancholy.</p>
<p>Every day, when the sunlight at the end of the sea is about to sink below the western horizon, I sit in my simple</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>wooden house, always staring blankly out of the small square window, watching the sea put on its beautiful evening gown: two or three small birds, leisurely circling over the sea, as if wanderers searching for a place to return; at the end of the sea and sky, a light purple haze rises. Fishermen, sailing small boats, smoothly ride the breeze, dispersing the mist, sailing on the shimmering sea at dusk, the bow cutting through the calm sea surface, as light as a swallow skimming the water. In a moment, the night will cover my window.</p>
<p>Perhaps the scenery at dusk is too beautiful, and sitting by the small window still cannot satisfy my desire for enjoyment. Or perhaps there is something else outside that attracts my attention more? Taking advantage of the sun not yet setting, I go for a walk on the beach.</p>
<p>At the seaside, I saw an old man, who at first did not catch my attention, but gradually his lonely figure and the sea at dusk occupied my mind. He was so weak: every day, every day, he dragged his slow steps, bent over, weakly tapping the sand with his cane, stumbling to the beach, where he sat down on a round green stone. The traces of his cane and his steps were imprinted on the beach, dragging a long tail, extending all the way to the distant, unseen part of the beach...</p>
<p>His excessive solemnity startled me, making me afraid to approach him, only daring to watch him from afar. The old man quietly gazed at the distance of the sea, as if there was an incomprehensible secret in front of him.</p>
<p>As days passed, this strange old man became more familiar in my impression. I was no longer as afraid to approach him as before. I tried to talk to him, I stared at him, but he ignored me, as if he didn't feel anything at all.</p>
<p>When the sunlight was just flashing the last rays of the day at the end of the sea and sky, and the dark hand of darkness was about to grip the earth tightly, the old man's deeply sunken, dry eye sockets would, as usual, be rolling with crystal clear tears. Several times, I was inexplicably moved by the old man to tears as well. Every day was like that, the seaside was so quiet that only the sound of waves lapping the beach could be heard, and the old man would still drag his slow steps back to his original path.</p>
<p>Finally, I vowed that I would understand the old man's story. So, I closely followed behind him.</p>
<p>About a hundred steps from the sea, on a high slope, was the old man's residence—a dilapidated hut worn down by wind and rain year after year. Before the old man returned to the house, at the door of this house, there was a middle-aged woman in her thirties, sitting there blankly waiting. In front of her was a lunch basket.</p>
<p>The old man opened the lock on the door, the middle-aged woman put the lunch basket on a small table, and then turned around and walked out of the house, without saying a word. The old man never paid any attention to her.</p>
<p>One day, before the old man returned to his house, I asked this middle-aged woman, inquiring about the old man's story: "Excuse me, what is this old man to you?"</p>
<p>"He is my father!"</p>
<p>"Then why don't you talk to him every day?"</p>
<p>"Alas! He doesn't like us women. He likes sons. He says daughters are all debt collectors!"</p>
<p>"Then does he have sons?"</p>
<p>"He has sons, he has two sons. My eldest brother went to a very, very far place on the other side of the sea eight years ago. He said he went to make money. He said he would come back the next year, but, alas..." She wiped away her tears with the corner of her clothes: "He hasn't come back until now. Some people say he joined the army and was killed on the battlefield. Some even said he sent a letter back, telling us not to miss him, but my father doesn't know this news yet!"</p>
<p>"Then what about his second son?"</p>
<p>"My second younger brother?" She raised her head, opened a pair of desolate eyes, and glanced at me: "Alas, it was the year before last, the year before last, he went out to fish and encountered a big storm and was swept away by the waves. His body hasn't been found until now..." As she spoke, she began to cry mournfully.</p>
<p>In the distance, the sound of the old man's cane tapping on the beach reached our ears, tapping on our hearts with each tap.</p>
<h3>Under the Sunlight (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Under the sun, they still run desperately for their own livelihood: one has to "collapse one day, that would be good."</p>
<p>Searching, searching, on the street, somewhere there is an open space, even if sweat flows like a spring, it is enough to excite them to spin around. Children play piercing gongs and drums, a set of flower spears, a set of dog iron rings, a set of lotus ballads... Under the hot sun, people are so hot that they are about to faint. When the police come to interfere, they also send the coppers thrown down by the first few spectators as "cigarette money." With the remaining dozen or so coppers, how can the family of three survive?</p>
<p>Middle-aged Lao Guan became anxious and forgot about the scorching sun. Like a mad dog, he begged, begged, caring about the coppers on the ground, which were so few that people dared not look, dared not think about, those few coppers.</p>
<p>"What about today's life? What about life?" Thinking of this, his heart turned cold, but he still had to beg hard, attracting applause, attracting laughter...</p>
<p>He was out of breath, his face turned pale. The child looked scared and said softly, "Dad, take a rest, let us do it."</p>
<p>"No, no! One more time, and someone will throw coppers."</p>
<p>Still begging like a mad dog, the sun scorching like fire, fewer and fewer people watching, but what about the money? The money collected had already been given to the police, and what about this day, this day...</p>
<p>A burst of dizziness, everything went black before his eyes, Lao Guan really fainted involuntarily. The passersby became agitated, the child cried empty-heartedly, someone gave him ten drops of Huoxiang Zhengqi water, but it was useless, saying that he had heatstroke and it was too deep, it was over...</p>
<p>It was over, which was ultimately good. In this era, Lao Guan had indeed reached the end of the road, and now, he finally collapsed, in front of life, under the sunlight.</p>
<h3>Lotus Lantern</h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>Old woman Shi woke up drenched in cold sweat. She rubbed her blurry eyes and looked at everything in the room distrustfully. Although it was not yet light, everything looked so familiar to her that she suddenly realized that she had just had a nightmare.</p>
<p>She vaguely saw her son kneeling in front of her bed, wearing a short jacket soaked in blood, begging her in a sorrowful voice.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm suffering so much now! Give me some pocket money to spend. If you have enough money, please ask a craftsman to make me a set of clothes, this blood-soaked short shirt and pants are too embarrassing! I have suffered enough in the underworld, people are abusing me, saying that I am a poor ghost..."</p>
<p>Old woman Shi recognized that this was her son who had died not long ago. She just wanted to reach out to touch him and ask him where he came from, but suddenly, the rooster crowed in the next room, and he ran out of the window in a panic. Old woman Shi just wanted to hold on to him, but because she used too much force, she didn't catch him and instead fell down herself.</p>
<p>She didn't fall to the ground. This was a dream, she was still lying in bed. Now she woke up. The corners of her eyes were still wet, and she muttered to herself in a low voice:</p>
<p>"What's wrong, is Long'er returning to life? Sigh, he really has suffered enough. Since he died, I only burned four hundred silver ingots for him. How is that enough for him to spend? He has no relatives in the underworld..." Perhaps because the fifteenth of July was approaching, her son gave her a dream, asking her to chant scriptures for him so that he could be reborn. Her son was good by nature, she thought in her heart, but he followed bad companions and committed a murder, so he couldn't be reborn.</p>
<p>She immediately thought of something that happened a year ago. Her son used to sell snacks at the entrance of the village. At that time, she herself was suffering from a bad illness and didn't have money to hire a doctor, which made him very anxious. On that day, she still remembered clearly, it was the thirteenth day of the sixth lunar month, before dawn, he got up, his face pale, and ran to the bed anxiously to tell her:</p>
<p>"Mom, I need to go to the city. I'll be back early in the morning. Maybe I can ask a doctor from the city to come to the village..."</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on (Little Sisters)</h3>
<p>"Little Sisters" tells the story of a young girl named Lin Manli who lives with her stepmother, Ms. Li, and her sister, Manna. The stepmother treats her harshly, abusing and bullying her in every way, and she always favors her own daughter, Manna. Therefore, Manna becomes even more arrogant and intimidating, viewing her sister, Manli, as a thorn in her side, and driving her like a servant. Manli is in such a situation, simply like an animal, spending her days in tears, yet lacking the ability to resist, so she can only cry in vain. Her pitiful experience and her difficult situation are enough to make the viewers shed tears of sympathy. The saying "the sun in autumn, the fist of the stepmother" is proven here to be true and not just empty talk.</p>
<p>Little Oolong Yuan Meiyun plays both roles of the gentle Manli and the spoiled Manna mentioned above. One day, when filming several scenes of Manna slapping Manli in the face, Huang Jiamo, who was watching from the side, found it amusing and said to Yuan Meiyun: "Miss Yuan, aren't you just slapping yourself in the face?" Although this is a joke, the meaning contained in his words is indeed very profound. How exactly Yuan Meiyun is slapping herself in the face, this ingenious photography technique is indeed worth watching.</p>
<p>Xu Qinfang made a comeback this time, guest starring in the role of the stepmother. She is indulgent and doting towards Manna, but strict and mean towards Manli. Therefore, in this play, she constantly uses two extremely opposite faces, that is, a standard stepmother who is extremely fierce. And her performance is "indeed" very good, tightly grasping the identity of the character in the play, making the audience's sense of injustice and resistance unable to be extinguished even after three days.</p>
<p>In summary, "Little Sisters" is a family tragedy, but on the other hand, the satirical humor mixed in is also very rich. Therefore, although it can make people cry sadly, it can also make people laugh, laugh until their stomachs hurt and tears flow.</p>
<h3>Little Singer Babe Bai Ling in "Liyuan Thinks of Her Son"</h3>

<h3>News of (Our Children's Theater) Preparation</h3>
<p>The twentieth century not only discovered the power of the people; but children have also begun to understand the true self-help movement, to fight against all those who deny children's abilities and oppress children into becoming slaves. Especially in this cry for national salvation, progressive children have recognized their abilities—the same "human" abilities as adults—and are prepared to unite into a vast and powerful children's front, standing on an equal footing with adult groups, and holding hands tightly with all truly revolutionary and progressive adult groups. Now, receiving the news of the establishment of the "Our Children's Theater Preparatory Committee" proves that the children of the twentieth century have indeed bravely jumped out of the "attached" prison, broken free from the shackles of slavery, and appeared in this stormy era with a new posture, becoming fighters on the revolutionary front.</p>
<p>From the name "Our Children's Theater," it can of course be understood that this children's theater is not art for art's sake, or selfish individualistic play, but belongs to the vast "us"—belongs to the new bright society, a part of the collective power of the people.</p>
<p>Now, the "Our Children's Theater Preparatory Committee" still feels that there are not enough talents; and in order to gather the many progressive children scattered everywhere, so that the organization of the society can be more sound and the cadres more solid, it is specially seeking comrades publicly (under sixteen years old, over thirteen years old). It is hoped that all progressive children will automatically and bravely participate. And please, gentlemen who care for children, after receiving the news of their seeking comrades, immediately pass it on to progressive children. Participants should first send a letter to Haiyan Theater, No. 7 Huatongfang, North Xizang Road Bridge, or to Lu Jing, No. 50 Jishanli, Kangnuot Road, Kangnuo Village. Or go directly to Haiyan Theater to talk to He Tuoxin face to face (time: 3 PM to 8 PM daily), or go to No. 50 Jishanli to talk to Lu Jing face to face (time: morning daily).</p>
