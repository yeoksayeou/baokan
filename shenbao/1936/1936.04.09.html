<h3>對德覆文　法國備忘錄公布　建議分政治經濟兩部份　主張樹立歐洲永久和平</h3>
<p>（巴黎）政府頃發表備忘錄兩伴、共一係答復德國三月三十一日所提出之備忘錄、幷對於該國廢止羅卡諾公的所依據之理由、加以駁斥、其二乃係和平計劃、第一備忘錄業已分送羅卡諾公約其他各簽字國、卽英比意三國政府、第二備忘錄則除分送各該國外、幷以一份送達國聯會、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國對於四月一日德元首希特勒陳述歐洲新和平方案之備忘錄、現已發表覆文、其所發表者、係長十三頁之備忘錄、及內分二十五節詳載法國提議之宣言、其關於政治之部份、載有組織歐洲委員會之提議、並主張二十五年內不得變更業已擔任之義務、又建議設立國際軍隊及大規模軍縮、其關於經濟之部份、內言貨幣安定信用讀大及市塲支配等事、其最後規定為任何事件須在國聯機構內為之、法外長佛蘭亭與不管部閣員彭古將以其如何决定希特勒備忘錄之意見通知日內瓦參加羅卡諾公的簽字國會議之他國代表、</p>
<p>法國備忘錄敘言之要旨、為「和平須為全部而耐久者、和平須有同等權利者、和平須有信任各方面榮譽及尊重諾言者、和平須以國際交易為根據、以代替經濟的國家主義之競爭俾臻穩健者、」宣言書二十五節、內有二節專言「不得有霸權」、內稱、如受人民需要或野心之支配則不能得耐久的和平、如爭議不為秉公解釋、而有拘束力量的國際法律所解决、則不能得國際關係之安全互助的援助必須地方條的規定之、又謂條的必不可認為永遠不變、但亦必不可片面毀棄之、</p>
<p>法國覆文在政治辦法之標題下聲稱、歐洲乃一個地方單位、如以歐洲幅員過大、不能以互助與軍縮適用集體安全、則不妨組織地方恊的、與關於各國獨立之地方條的、而各種軍備限制應置於立的互担保之下、各種制裁甚至在必要時武力者應予採行、俾伸國際法律、歐洲方內之國家應設特殊陸軍海軍與空軍、歸國聯或歐洲委員會指揮之、歐洲委員會對於範圍內條的之實施、有永久管理權、以言軍縮、各個國軍備限制之程度、應以歐洲委員會或其他國聯機關二分二之多數决定之、各個國有權上訴於國聯行政院所設之最高永久仲裁委員會、法國覆文又謂萊茵之不駐兵、乃歐洲唯一安全担保、德國不欲置身於海牙國際法庭、因自知其理由必遭駁斥也、德國不願作必要之姿勢、對於羅卡諾公的其他簽字國和解之努力有所供獻、德國之和平方案、不幸僅為有名無實之供獻、法國所欲知者、其所擬之西方天空公的是吾包括空軍限制在內、苟無限制、則此的全無價值、德國之方案完全不足以固定和平時代、德國今縱復入國聯、但他日如其殖民地權利之要求不能饜滿、則難免不再退出國聯云、（八日路透社電）</p>
<h3>第一備忘錄</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國對於德國備忘錄所提出之備忘錄、卽第一備忘錄頃已公佈、其內容共分十點、曾將德國廢止羅卡諾公的所依據之理由、一一加以駁斥、其大要如次</p>
<p>（一）德國政府前於三月七日廢止羅卡諾公的幷遣派軍隊關入萊茵河區域之後國　法治制度已被破壞、法國因避免國際糾紛起見、幷未採取適當辦法、用以立卽回復原狀、而與羅卡諾公的其他各簽字國進行談話、冀有以保全友善解决之可能性、此在羅卡諾公的各簽字國亦復顧全德國體面而於三月十九日恊出提定草案、無如德國認為有傷於該國榮譽、且未能以平等權利給予該國因而加以拒絕、實則德國榮譽旣無人加以損害、卽平等權利亦無人勒而不予、此外、該國雖允重返國聯會、但仍要求須在事前修正國聯會盟的、</p>
<p>（二）德國備忘錄對於萊茵河非武裝區域制度、曾就歷史觀點有所論列、謂與美國故大總統威爾遜所提出之十四項原則相抵觸、實則巴黎和會、前於一九一九年間討論萊茵河區域解除武裝一項問題時、德國代表團從未提出抗議、至羅卡諾公的、乃德國在前協商各國軍隊自萊茵河區域撤退之後、所自由簽訂者、該國亦竟片面予以廢止、其所依據之理由、收謂凡爾賽和的係在壓迫之下所簽訂、厥後羅卡諾公的未能將凡爾賽和的關係該國領土各項條欵加以修正、因而該國對於羅卡諾公的所載某種條欵、（卽關於萊茵河非武裝區域者）自有拒絕加以尊重之權利、然則吾人對於德國今後所可簽字之條約價值若何、自不能不加以懷疑、因而得一結論、卽德國今後對於但澤自由市與米美爾自治區域現行制度、對於奧國現行狀况、亦將掀起問題、對於歐洲若干國現行疆界、亦將要求加以修正、對於該國原有之殖民地、亦將要求予以發還是也」、凡此種種問題、德國允宜明白答復、</p>
<p>（三）德國對於法俄兩國互助公的、雖認為與羅卡諾公的相牴觸但羅卡諾公的其他各簽字國、並未提出異議、觀於德國拒不求直於海牙國際法庭、即知其理由不充分、</p>
<p>（四）羅卡諾公的各簽字國雖準備依據德國備忘錄所提出之建議案而進行談判、幷成立新協定、用以代替羅卡諾公的、但一切談判、苟以「旣成事實」為基礎、則决非各該國所願為、又况德國廢約之後、一再拒不表示妥協、允其是萊茵河區域駐軍撤退一部份、與不在該區域建造防禦工事兩層、均堅决加以拒絕、安見有進行談判之可能、</p>
<p>（五）德國備忘錄雖會提出各項和平建議、但須俟該國提供堡證、情願履行諾言之後、始可加以考慮、「萊茵河非武裝區域制度、匪特法比兩國安全所繫、卽全歐洲亦利害攸關、此項制度撤廢之後、應如何加以補救、德國備忘錄並未提出諾言、」吾人以為該國對於集體安全一項原則能吾加以信守、自可於該國是吾在萊茵河區域建造防禦工事一舉覘之、</p>
<p>（六）德國備忘錄所提議之互不侵略公的殊有未盡、此項公的計劃旣未能插入集體安全制、其與東歐洲各國締結互助公的之議、亦且格格不相入、加之德國本係凱洛格非戰公的之簽字國、原不得以戰爭為推行國策之工具、他日卽使訂立互不侵略公的、其於原來所負義務、又安能有所增益、要之、任何辦法、凡將歐洲劃分為東西兩部份、僅為西歐安全着想者、法國均所拒絕</p>
<p>（七）德國重返國聯會之議法國自所歡迎第以該國最近之舉動而論、則二次退盟之威脅、仍無以防止之、至該國提議設立國際伸裁法庭之舉、直乃吾認海牙國際法庭、幷吾認國聯會行政院之職權、</p>
<p>（八）德國關於縮减軍備之建議案關于陸空兩軍、幷未載有質的量的限制辦法、至關于戰爭人道化一項問題、雖屬言之成理、但若能主張互助制度、用以對付未來之侵略國、俾戰爭無由發生、則其實效允有足多者、</p>
<p>（九）法國對于促進法德兩國關係之議幷不加以拒絕、且盡其所能、以冀達此目的、卽國聯會亦正企圖在精神上弭兵、</p>
<p>（十）法國隨時履行國際義務、並無修正現行憲法之必要、反之維護和平、必須以互相尊重權利為起點而互相合作、始克有濟、各國之間、遇有爭端發生、未便單獨與其鄰國自求解决辦法、而置集體安全原則於不顧、</p>
<p>「要之歐洲頒士政治現狀、能吾毫無保留而加以承認、歐洲現狀能吾經由互助制度而加以保全、德國在其送達英國政府之備忘錄、並無一字及之」云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>第二備忘錄</h3>
<p>（巴黎）法國對於德國備忘錄、除提出第一備忘錄、加以答復之外、同時幷提出第二備忘錄、詳載和平計劃、首云、「法蘭西共和國政府、今茲所提議者、乃在維護各國榮譽而由各國履行諾言之中、尊重各國平等權利、鼓勵國際貿易、以達到普遍的完全的持久的和平、幷由切實限制軍備之途徑踏入縮减軍備之地步、以達到眞正的和平」</p>
<p>此項計劃乃以下開各項原則為根據、　權利平等國際義務須加以尊重、法國政府以為和平若果以各民族之需要與慾望為轉移、則和平終不可期、　國際法治當有强制性質相當保障、　稱霸之事在所不許、法國政府以為各國均得在某種情况之下、允其是在軍備問題之下、自由放棄一部份主權、各國軍力苟有軒輊之處、幷得締結普遍的互助公的以補救之、（未完）（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>三國參謀部談話　英國代表人選</h3>
<p>下院反對情緒仍濃厚</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國參加三國參謀部談話之代表人員、德已派定狄爾少將。安聞森少將·伊斯梅上校·裴傑特上校、及安達姆爵士等五人、而以狄爾少將為首席代表、渠為英國少壯軍官之特出人材、曾充參謀部軍官學校校長、帝國國防學校敎官等職、學識才能、素為軍界所推重云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於英法比三國參謀部所當舉行之談話、艾登外相曾於上星期五（三日）向下議院提出解釋、謂此項談話所可决定之辦法、僅可在各關係國進行一般談判期內發生效力、其性質純屬技術方面、故在政治上自不致加重英國義務、而關係各國之國防組織、亦不因此而接受何項的束云云、經此解釋之後、下院空氣似已為之澄淸、卽對於談話原則反對最力者、所懷疑慮亦似為之渙釋、詎知下議院於本日下午開會時、反對派工黨議員弗萊謙與保守黨極端派議員邱吉爾、均就此問題、相繼向首相鮑爾溫提出質問、足見下議院若千方面對於此項談話、反對情緒現有重熾之勢矣、茲將弗萊謙邱吉爾與首相鮑爾溫問答之語、摘要錄下、弗萊謙問、請內閣提出保證、籌備此項談話者、為內閣而非參謀部、</p>

<p>防止國社黨暗中策動</p>
<p>（維也納）據可靠方面今日消息、奧國政府已大事充實德國邊境之防務、以預防自德國境內所策動之國社黨革命、並禁止私運軍火過境、數星期來、軍火私運來奧者、突然增加、上星期格拉茲地方發生殺案二起、顯有政治作用、此間當局謂奧國國社黨之主使此等殺案、係報復叛黨份子、此問今日且悉有運往匈牙利之軍火一批、在林資緝獲、故一般人皆信奧國以後欲控制國社黨之國際活動、將大戚困難、官方稱、意相墨索里尼會表示、國社黨如侵犯奧國、意國可給以軍事上之援助、惟政府相信、卽有意國援助、亦僅能抵抗數星期之久而已、故奧國甚願西歐國家對於此事表示態度云、（七日國民電）</p>

<h3>十三國委員會　舉行秘密會議　討論意軍使用毒彈事　英法形成對壘狀態</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今日十三國委員在此開會時、英外相艾登質問委員會對於意國施放毒氣之事、有無所知、國聯秘書長愛文諾答稱、此事是吾屬實、尙無證據可得、艾登又謂施放毒氣為一九二五年之日內瓦議定書所禁止、意國對於此項議定書皆曾簽字、不應明知故犯者、至是法國外長起立、要求國聯調查阿軍採用達姆達姆彈及任意殘殺意國俘虜之事、於此可見英法兩國在日內瓦之立塲、已形成對壘狀態、至下午四時委員會卽行休會、俾西班牙代表瑪達里茄與愛文諾將此事詢問國際紅十字會、墨西哥代表由倫敦寄書於國聯對於國聯遲遲對意制裁一舉、提出抗議、並稱墨西哥不願負擔削弱集體和平之責任云、據一般觀察、英國對於意大利之態度又趨於强硬、而法國對意態度則又中變矣、（八日國民電）</p>

<p>阿京　今日午後宮中宣讀阿王召集全國能服兵役者入伍之命令、同時北路陣錢之觀察者皆互詢曰、阿王何在乎、阿王大的因恐為意轟炸機所注目、故已棄其汽車、策驟南下、其汽車已為意軍所獲、王太子現率二千人由臺西北上覓衛其父、聞携械之匪衆殺刦阿王敗兵、頗為殘酷、瓜蘭以南之沿途、屍體枕藉、前進之意軍須掩埋隊淸除道路、始得移動、王太子恐其父遇險、故不得不往保衛之也、意軍刻在瓜蘭南面分兩路而進、一沿「帝國路」進窺臺西、一趨瑪格臺拉、意軍現稱阿國土地已入意軍掌握者面積廣及不列顛之半、（七日路透電）</p>

<h3>莫斯科報評論　蒙俄互助協定</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）「消息報」社論謂、三月十二日簽訂於庫倫之互助草的、爲堅定不移爭取和平之一顯例、亦爲蘇聯在完全平等及互惠基礎上、扶助和平及友好人民、英勇爭取其生存與獨立權利之一顯例、</p>
<p>蘇聯及蒙古人民共和國人民、十五年來以密切不懈之友誼互相聯繫、此種友誼產生於一九二一年共禦外敵之際、彼時蘇聯政府接受蒙古人民共和國之請求、遺紅軍入外蒙、與蒙古人民革命軍聯合擊潰日本干涉者之傭兵刦掠隊伍、彼欲如役蒙古人民、並使外蒙變爲日本之殖民地、及日本帝國主義繼續進攻蘇聯之根據地、在此共同勝利鬥爭中、誕生並實現蘇聯政府及蒙古入民共和國政府間之互助協定、卽在將來、締的國之一國再受第三者軍事攻擊威脅之際、亦仍有效、由於外蒙政府請求、蘇聯政府允於同年暫將一部份軍隊留駐蒙古人民共和國境內、直至蒙古人民共和國受人攻擊危險消滅時止、迨遠東情勢、使蘇聯駐兵外蒙已不需要之際、蘇聯政府得蒙古人民共和國政府之同意、於一九二五年初、將全部軍隊退出外蒙、</p>
<p>余等檢視一九二五年二月二十七日蒙古人民共和國政府說帖、曾稱謝蘇聯政府予蒙古人民之援助如下、「政府代表蒙古人民共和國全體人民、表示其對紅軍予蒙古人民共和國人民以不可磨滅友誼之深切滿意及戚謝、請君以蒙古人民之深切感謝、傳達蘇聯之工人農民及英勇紅軍世界被壓迫及被奴役民衆之永久保護者、及貴國政府之領導機關、</p>
<p>蒙古人民共和國之勞動人民及其政府、咸信兩國將來必將於共同患難時期繼續其眞誠友誼及相互援助、我國人民及政府允敢深信如竟復見一九二一年之情形—此非吾人所願—蘇聯及其紅軍必將予以援助、」</p>
<p>由此余等可見卽在一九二五年北京條的簽訂之際、蘇聯與外蒙仍保持其深切友好及相互援助關係、此種關係建立於一九二一年、且與中國之利益完全吻合、</p>
<p>舉生從事中國人民解放事業之孫逸仙博士之偉大革命、完全證實蘇聯援助對於保障外蒙之神聖及完整使其不致變爲進攻蘇聯及中國之根據地、乃有全部必要、孫逸仙博士於一九二三年一月與蘇聯駐華代表聯合公報之中、指出「俄國軍隊之立卽退出外蒙旣非急要亦非中國之眞正福利、允因現今北京政府不能保障在俄軍退出以後、反俄白軍不再施其陰謀、造成較現今更嚴重之形勢、」</p>
<p>蘇聯保障外蒙邊境安全、不僅對於蘇聯安全爲一首要工作、卽對中國亦然、且中國政府負有責任不使外蒙成爲攻擊蘇聯之根據地、曾載於北京條的之中、該的第五條謂蘇聯政府承認外蒙古爲中華民國之構成部分、尊重中國在該地之主權、同時該條規定、蘇聯將其軍隊退出外蒙之手續「蘇聯軍隊之自外蒙全部撤回、關於撤回軍隊期限、及設法保證邊境安全、應開會商定、」</p>
<p>此條業已明示、中國政府亦曾承認蘇聯有權於一定時機採用各種方法、例如派兵入蒙古人民共和國、以保障其邊境、撤兵辦法、早應根據北京協定召集中蘇會議商定甚明、然而此種會議竟未召集、此非蘇聯之過乃被中國內戰及中國政府之不穩定所阻止、然而蘇聯政府不待召集中蘇會議、竟自動提出、並得蒙古人民共和國政府同意、於駐軍蒙古人民共和國境內已非必要時、立卽撤其駐軍、同時蘇聯政府固仍負有義務、襄助蒙古人民以維持其領土之完整及尊嚴、與夫經濟文化建設、因此至一九三四年、蒙古人民共和國復受領十侵略威脅之際、蒙古人民共和國內閣總理庚登向蘇聯政府提出、於蒙古人民共和國受人攻擊時要求予以援助、兩國重申其在彼等受第三國攻擊時、作各種相互援助、—包括軍事援助—之義務、此固理所當然、此項協定未經正式訂的、乃爲口頭諒解、卽所謂紳士協定、</p>
<p>當一九三五年日滿軍隊開始屢决進攻蒙古人民共和國領土之際、蘇聯政府屢請日本政府注意其深切關心於維持外蒙尊嚴、事實上在日滿軍企圖攫取外蒙領士之際、蘇聯决難旁觀、然而不顧此等嚴厲之反覆警吿、日滿軍之攻擊蒙古人民共和國領土、不僅繼續進行、且採取更挑釁響大胆之性質、因此蒙古人民共和國政府至一九三五年一月、認爲必須派遣代表團、至莫斯科要求將原有口頭協定正式改訂互助公的、允給蒙古人民共和國以援助、今年一月二十五日、蒙古人民共和國「小庫拉爾」主席團及內閣會議、再向蘇聯要求援助、特作書面申請、遞交加里寗及莫洛托夫、由「小庫拉爾」主席阿穆爾及內閣總理庚登簽名、</p>
<p>蘇聯政府同意蒙古人民共和國政府之要求、於一九三六年三月十二日在庫倫簽訂草的、决乃更明確規定相互援助義務之具體化、此項義務、遠在一九二一年卽已建立於聯合反抗干涉基礎之上、此項協定且與一九二四年之北京協定完全符合、日本軍閥中之最無理由冒險份子、現正努力再謀攫取外蒙、顯然、蘇聯政府如此行動、完全符合彼對蒙古人民共和國之各種義務、且爲維持和平、此種自衛行動、决不致絲亳侵犯中國人民之利益、</p>
<p>在霍華特與蘇聯人民領袖史丹林會談之中、史氏曾以率直及明白態度、宣稱、「如日本竟敢攻擊蒙古人民共和國、企圖侵犯彼之獨立、則余等不得不援助蒙古人民共和國、一如一九二一年所爲」、此語曾在蘇聯及蒙古人民共和國引起在熱、且得全世界全部和平友人最大之同情及瞭解、中國廣大民衆、亦自此說明中窺見蘇聯政府爭取和平之堅决表示、並知蘇聯政府此種立塲、亦與中國利益相合、蓋中國正在疲於反抗侵略、無力保障蒙古人民共和國之領土安全也、</p>
<p>一九三六年三月十二日三草的、爲一和平文件卽蘇聯最惡敵人、亦不能在韋的中於警吿侵略他國領土者、及蘇聯準備於蒙古人民成爲侵略犧牲時予以援助外獲得一字、酷愛和平之蒙古人民、决無對其鄰邦之侵略或帝國主義計劃、且遠東和平、完全繫於鄰邦、此乃無待瞪明、（八日塔斯電）</p>

<p>至於人民負担、從前賦稅分地丁·　米·存軍米·絕軍米四種、地丁每銀一兩、徵正稅一元四角、省附稅一角八分七厘、　防捐六元二角、縣政捐五角六分、敎育捐三角七分四厘、漕米每担、征正稅二元八角、縣政捐一元一角二分、敎育捐二角六分二厘、存軍米每担征正稅一元四角九分四厘、團防捐三元六角、絕軍米每担征正税一元三角零七厘、團防捐三元六角、存軍米與絕軍米、皆前清留存之特種稅、去冬廢除担兩、改畝征收國幣、全縣合計二十五萬零零一十五畝、每畝征正稅一角四分、畝捐二角八分、附加縣政捐五分、敎育捐二分、每年分上下兩忙、各征半數、人民以畝捐太重、皆有不克負担之苦、關于苛捐雜稅方面、在民二十以前縣屬白雲潭、設有出產捐征收所、征收米穀皮油火紙等捐、經旅省同鄉代有龐步驥等呈准裁撤、現雖存有少數捐稅、迹近苛雜、但係人民自願征以興學者、大體上亦無甚關係也、他如農村借貨、尚無重利盤剝之事、合作事業亦在努力推進、農村預備合作社、共六十四所、貸放生產資金三萬元、第一年所放之疑、下季完全自動不清、人民之信用、亦大可欽佩、</p>

<h3>公共租界外董選舉　檢票錯誤澈查結果　原因發生於簡單之疏忽　關係人員並無故意過失</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局董事會、前為上决舉行外董選舉、發生票數錯誤事、會任命該局現任董事卡耐凱勒利·及山本武夫·等三人、組織調查委員會、澈查錯誤發生價相、該委員會自上月三十日開始調查以來、至昨日已吿藏事、茲特將其呈交董事會報吿書擇要先為披露如下、</p>
<p>原文甚長、前後共十四頁、茲特先將其結論陳述如次、該結論曰、「據本委員會調查之所得、此决選舉票未能全部檢點之遺漏、其責任應由檢票員二人、工部局總辦。及財務處副處長（捐務主任）等分負之」、該委員會為避免將來同等事件之發生起見、並主張、本年新董事會、應訓令工部局人員、在地產章程範圍之內、擬具新條例、規定選舉及檢票之手續程序、及各辦事人之責任及任務等」、此外該委員會並主張、現在工部局「服務規定」、中所稱、工部局總辦即係工部局之「選舉報吿人」等字樣、因其僅係一九二五年納稅人年會議案中有此稱謂、而非地產章程所規定、並與英國所謂「選舉報吿人」之職務地位、逈不相同、故擬將該稱調刪除、再則此外調查之中、所詢工部局高級職員、其仟務及責任之界限、復多不分明處、故此節雖不在此次選舉事項調查範圍之內、但事屬切要、故亦擬請新董事會、另行組織委員會、以從事工都局高級職員之賣任及任務之調查及界說云、</p>
<p>調查範圍　此次調查委員會任務之範圍、約略言之、可分為如下之三項、　調查此次外董選舉中，檢票發生遺漏之原因、　審定各關係人員之責任、及　提議此後選舉機械如何改良之方、該委員會根據上述之範圍、遂開始其調查工作、所詢及諸人員、計有檢票員威爾遜·及波爾森·二人、工部局人員方面、計有總辦鐘思·財務處副處長（捐務處主任波恩·財務處會計員米特頓·高級帮辦考茂蘭·日籍會辦指宿秀年·總辦處帮皮士萊·及財務處帮辦克里尼等、以上諸人、均屬檢票時在場、而鐘思氏則於開始檢票時、檢票告終時、及其間斷續之時間在場、</p>
<p>錯誤原因　據調查委員會報吿書之所稱、「本委員會在聽取一切見證之後、深信此决選舉票檢點之錯誤·完全出於疏忽、所得一切證據、對於每個有關係人員、俱無絲亳行為不正可疑之點、惟錯誤既巳發生、其在議事廳內、即選舉票檢點之地、指揮之缺乏、實屬無可疑義」云、該報吿書復稱、「此種指揮之缺乏、係由於每個在場人員之責任及任務、均無明白之指示」、</p>
<p>責任分析　查地產章程規定、辦理選舉之責之責、則應由檢票員二人負之、惟據委員會調查之所得、此决檢票員、事前並未了解其責任及任務、彼等稱在檢票之時、並未查視票匭二隻之是吾完全空虛、此誠不敢逃其責、惟同時在場者有工部局高級職員如許、故彼等均以為他人必已注意及此事云、按諸多年已成之慣例、檢票員此種設想似亦在情理之中、但在另一方面、檢票員旣已身受託付之重、豈可對於地產章程所規定之任務、絕不加以研究因此調查委員會深覺、「此决檢票員二人、在技術上言之、應負錯誤之責任、惟在當時形勢之下、工部局總辦及捐務主任、亦不能辭其責、」至捐務處主任之責任、據彼自身所了解者、原以選舉第二日下午三時、選舉截止、票匭遞交檢蔡員時為止境、惟按多年已成之慣例、該員恒於事後留處檢票場、中以協助檢票員之工作、此種協助、為辦理迅速起見、確巳視為不可缺少、且因彼之此種協助、檢票員責任之範圍、巳為之掩蓋不少、故在事實上、該員確已擔任僉票指軍黃任之一部分、因此委員會深覺、「捐務處主任、此項工作、雖係根於習慣而來、但對於此决錯誤之發生、亦應分擔其實任、」至總辦之職務、若以地產章程所規定奢而言、僅限於代表工部局通吿、職員二人、使辦理選舉、及檢票員二人、使辦理檢票而已、惟根據於一九二五年納稅人年會之决議、為保持選舉投票之秘密起見、總辦有於事後焚燬選舉票之責任、其他資任之為總辦在事實上所擔承者、計尙有選舉未舉行以前、空票匭之封鎖、事後延見檢票員、交給票述之鑰匙、及發表選舉結果等項、惟據記載所示、工部局總辦對於檢票員之責任、為地產章程所規定奢、於任命時實從無加以說明者、故為補救起見、嗣後於任命檢票員時、應將地產章程關於此事之條文附入、再則總辦於選舉票檢點之時、並無必須蒞場之需要、彼之所應為者、不過檢票未開始之前、接見檢票員、授以錀匙、及檢票吿終之後、接受其報吿而已、惟亦為多年慣例之故、總辦恒於檢票之時、到場作短時間之視察、且自一九三三年以來、總辦到場視察之時間、亦日益延長、允以本年為甚、據總辦之所陳述、彼之所以為此、不過為帮助性質、惟委員會深覺、「彼之逗留檢票場內、因其地位界說之欠缺、且同時復有其他工部局高級職員一人在場、二人俱各有助手若干人、實為造成指揮缺乏之原因、因此該員對於錯誤之發生、亦不得不分負其責任、」其餘一切人員、俱屬總辦及捐務主任之屬員、且係奉命而來、任務旣無規定、不過隨時協助而已、</p>
<p>其他部份　調查報吿書、其他部份之重要者、尙有辦理選舉及檢票手續士改良之詳細辦法、以及辦理選舉人員責任及任務之細則、及地產章程、關於選舉之條文、一九二五年納稅人年會關於選舉秘密之决議、歷年辦理之手續等、茲以限於篇幅、不及一一備載矣、</p>

<p>新新社云、實業部為統制漁業救濟漁民起見、特在上海楊樹浦周家嘴島、建築大漁市塲一座、全部工程、已於去年十一月吿成、因組織等問題未解决、故迄未開幕、茲經實業部長吳鼎昌與滬市紳商虞洽卿杜月笙張紳之林康侯等數度洽商結果、决定官商合辦、股本額國幣一百二十萬元、分為一萬二千股、每股一百元、官商各半、現官股六十萬、已由實業部繳足、商股方面、除冰鮮業十五萬元、尙待今日决定外、河鮮魚行業、已認繳五萬元、另由交通銀行暫借十萬元、尙有三十萬元、則由滬市商界認足、</p>
<p>冰鮮參加　本市冰鮮魚行業同業公會、對於實業部官商合辦漁市場之原則、初甚贊成嗣因三千餘職工、深恐漁市塲開業後、生計發生恐慌、會提出六點、請求補救、茲悉該會復於昨日下午、召開緊急會議、討論結果、决定參加僅有若干瑣屑問題、待今日洽商决定後、卽行認股加入、故冰鮮業反對已無問題、</p>
<p>股東大會　實業部上海漁市場　股份有限公司、準於明日（十日）上午十一時假中匯銀</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>行召開股東創立會、外傳今日開股東會不確、至會議地點及時間、尙待今日决定、屆時除互選理事十一人、監察五人、再由實業部由常務理事中指定一人為理事長外、並討諭開幕日期及一切應行籌備事宜、官商股東·杜月笙·錢新之·虞洽卿林康侯·沈田莘·等均準備出席、實業部已派漁牧司長來滬參加、</p>
<p>準備開幕　漁市塲有預定本月十九日正式開幕營業稅、但尙須經十日股東創立會通過决定、至該塲房屋、如冷藏庫市塲·浮碼頭·等各種工程、均經完畢、辦公·營業，等處、亦經布置就緒、而該塲營業辦法、决採取公開拍賣制度、俾價格劃一、排除操縱販抑積弊、並逐漸减低憔商漁民負擔、實行救濟我國垂危之漁業云、</p>
<h3>棉業統制委員會　救濟全國棉區</h3>
<p>散發優良棉籽二千一百噸　改良軋花採用鋸齒式軋機</p>
<p>申時社云我國山東河南河北陝西等地為產棉區域、每年產量總額的十一萬擔左右、惟去年山東河南湖北三省旱潦交困、棉籽多未播種、全國各省產量亦减少、故改進棉產、復興農村、實為刻不容緩之要圖、茲據商品檢騐局棉業專家馬廣文氏語申時社記者、對於棉業統制委員會今年救濟棉農辦法、分誌於後、</p>
<p>改良棉籽</p>
<p>棉業統制委員會、鑒於我國各地棉種、過去因棉農收藏不善、或雜以劣種、以致每年棉收、漸趨减少、如再不及時改換優良種籽、則吾國棉收、恐將受其影響、該會今春特在美國購進斯字第四號棉種二千一百噸、於三月到滬、並恐棉種內含有危害棉花之象鼻蟲、為防止美棉病蟲害起見、命上海商品檢驗局燻蒸消毒、由棉統制會運至各省散布、</p>
<p>救濟棉農</p>
<p>救濟產棉區之重心、大多着重於華北各省、因華北雨量較少、天時地理、均宜植棉、比江蘇安徽浙江等省為宜、故此决將二千一百噸棉種、大部份作為救濟陝西·河南·湖北·山東·產棉區之用、該項棉種、業於上月全部分發各省、</p>
<p>改良軋花</p>
<p>我國工業落後、一切機器、多沿用舊式、如各地所用軋花機、除滬漢等地有用棍軸花機者外、其餘大半用脚踏鐵機、使用此種不良機伴、軋後棉籽决難選擇優種、並且棉花纖維、被軋機軋斷、棉業統制會、茲為保持各棉區之優良棉種、及改良品質計、擬仿照埃及軋棉辦法、購用最新式之汽流式鋸齒軋花機、聞用該機軋花、能使棉花纖維保持原狀、棉籽亦不損傷云、</p>

<h3>上海之火腿販賣業（續）</h3>
<p>— 中國微信主編</p>
<p>（上海工商業概况之廿一）</p>
<p>北腿產於江蘇如皋一帶，產量以如皋為最，泰興江都二地决之，以其皆在江北，故名。近年北腿因銷路不佳，產量縮减，較南腿為甚，據調查所得，去年全年北腿產額最多不過三十萬只，較前年减少十分之三·四·其行銷地點，國內以本埠為最多，國外以菲律濱為最多。自產區如皋一帶運至上海，係用蔴袋包裝，每袋五十隻，的三百斤，先用民船或小輪還至如皋境之新陞港或南通境之天生港，然後由大達或大通輸船公司運至上海。推銷方法有二，一為在上海設有發行所者（如如皋腿棧，中國製腿公司，同和泰，王裕昌等），則由發行所直接出售，二爲拄上海無發行所奢，則由產地行商與上海腿商訂成聯號，托其銷售，提供相當佣金。今將如皋泰興兩縣至今尙存之腿商列記於左：</p>
<p>雲腿素傳產於雲南之騰越（一說產於宣威，但上海腿商均標宣威雲腿。據業中人云，四川亦產腿，往往混充雲腿，行銷市上。雲南農民製腿，往往墨守成法，不知改良，僅將猪之胸肋一併斬下，不加修割，故腿大成方形，校南北腿重而不美（每隻均在十斤以上）惟共肉味鮮嫩，過於蔣腿，但因所含脂肪過多（占全腿二分之一），不合江浙人口胃，故不能暢銷於上海。雲腿大多由雲南客商還米上海，多藏於木箱內，每箱僅十餘隻，從產地運至上海，往往經過香港，運費頗昂，因而售價亦甚高，本市銷貨，全年不過六七百隻，實甚有限。</p>

<p>學校調查</p>
<h3>上海法國學校概況（五）</h3>
<p>— 胡祖蔭</p>
<p>六、家庭聯絡辦法</p>
<p>該校對於聯絡學生家庭的辦法施行頗有成效。聯絡的方法乃是採用一種學校家庭通信簿。這本通信薄印成手冊的形式，可供一年之用。應用的方法是：敎師於每星期六將此簿交給學生帶同家中，請其家長閱看；家長看過此簿後於星期一將此簿交兒童帶至校中，交與敎師查閱。家長閱看此簿時，可在上而簽註意見或提出問題與學校商酌；如無意見或問題提出，則在上面簽一名字表示看過。敎師查閱此簿特，可將家長所提意見或問題予以答覆；敎師亦可在此簿上簽註或提出關於某生的意見，以與家長商酌。凡新生入學時，必須由其家長在此薄上留一簽名樣式，以防學生日後假冒簽名情事。</p>
<p>這種通信簿裹面所包括的各種項月值得在此介紹一下。通價簿中第一項是請家長塡明學生的姓名，生日，家長姓名，住址，電話等，以便學校查攷。下面設明校中　分的方法，以供家長參攷。第二項列出學生入學通則，加到校時間，衣帽寄存，寄午膳辦法，請假缺席辦法，停學除名辦法，自修功課辦法等。嚴後附以家長興敎師通信須知，希望家長能盡量利用此種通信簿，常與學校互通消息，共謀兒童之福利。第三項列出校中衛生要則若干條，如新生入學前須有醫生證明書，秤痘辦法，傳染病隔離日期及學校停課消毒各種辦法。第叫項是將兒童各科學業成績單列出，以每兩星期為一單位；敎師可將兒童兩週閒各科學業成績塡在上面，可使家長明瞭其子弟在兩週間的學業進步狀况。另一而，則有關於兒童行為的空白表格，家長和敎師均可將兩週間所觀察的兒童行為記在上面，以便彼此參攷。此種學業與行為記載表列出多張，可供一學期之用。第五項是列出一學期兒童的學業成績和行為記載表，可以代替學期終成績報吿單；末一段並附以校長對於該生一學期中學業和行為方而的評語。第六項是列出一張兒童在一學年中工作狀况比較表，將兒童在一學年中工作的成績按月地依據績點用曲綫表示出來，可使家長從這根曲綫上一望而可看出他的子弟的學業是在進步或在退步。據該校校長的意見，該校多年來採用遣本通信薄，深感此薄對於家庭與學樣的聯絡頗有極大的幫助。</p>
<p>附註：該樣平日歡迎教育界人士前往參觀；惟須事先向法公董局較育處學務監督或該校校長接洽。</p>

<h3>美華銀行昨日開幕</h3>
<p>今年銀錢業緊縮透支放欵、不肯儘量放做、致市面呆滯、各商號週轉困難、巳達極點、外商鑒於滬市金融枯澀之時乘機投資、由英美外商、聯合華商巨子、合創美華銀行於二馬路畔、資本雄厚、巳於昨日開幕、據其營業計劃、以扶助小商業為宗旨、凡稍有信用之商號、莫不儘量放欵、故昨日開慕之日、一般商號携欵前往開戶者、旋踵相接擁擠異常、而收入存欵、厥數甚鉅、據該行當局言、放欵可以無限制之推廣、誠如是則滬市金融、可以稍稍流動矣、</p>
<h3>證券　公債祇有掉期交易</h3>
<p>成交總數不滿一百萬　明日起春假停市四天</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所市面更覺呆滯、交易更見稀少、以四日之春假關係、新交易大都絕跡、市上除少數略有掉期賣買外、餘殊少人問津、環境情形、迷離恍惚、莫衷一是、益使人無所適從、故以觀望之結果、交易更趨淸淡、昨日交易之少、又為前所未有、市况經過、全日各盤、均在五分一角間盤旋、市便又復高低參差、漲跌互見、每種交易、均為極少數之成交、並有絕對未有開出者、每盤集會時間、不過數分鐘可以竣事、外界形勢、雖似有轉變之將來、而人心仍不為之稍稍衝動、市價不動則巳、稍有變動、必將劇降後、始有交易也、昨日市價結果、高低互見、大都本月份均小五分一角至一角半、六月份大都好五分一角、此因多頭掉期關係、成交總數、共計連九六廿一萬在內、祇九十八萬五千元、又發見證券交易所成交最少之新紀錄、茲將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　外棉上升人心穩定　紗藥愈益堅挺　現銷雖屬不暢　結果均告上漲</h3>
<p>紗　市續挺、漲風略起、良以海外紗花然况上漲、人氣益覺穩定、但現紗交易未見發展、因春假封關四日、各方動辦愈滯、但長豐又來購進、市盤頗為安定云、</p>
<p>五月期標紗漲一元</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一律上騰、以外棉因漲、大阪本呂紗趨高、且多頭拖進之籌碼不放、故氣勢益緊、但現紗交易不暢、同業看跌、意志未變、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲六·七·八·角至一元、午後開盤、各月又皇平靜之局、一盤以後、聞現貨成交僅四百餘包、三品紗略形回小、收盤抬面緊中帶硬、結果各月參差不定、上下一·二·三角、查賣出大孚七百包、合興四百五十包、慎記一千六百包、益昶一千三百包、信誠一千四百包、泰昌五百五十包、昌記三百包、大豐三百包、買進明德七百包、賡豐五百包、長豐二千七百包、森康五百五十包、協成六百包、生源四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>百四十五包、售價堅昂、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉　市愈堅、局勢良好、以美棉印棉一致上昇、人心更挺、但現棉銷路淸疲、一般棉商傾向拋賣、本月份有天津粗絨三萬餘擔交解、多方亦聞準備收貨云、</p>
<p>標花缺乏新賣戶</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均高翔、以美棉漲六至八磅音、印棉漲〇·七五至一羅比半、大阪三品花漲三·四角、市塲人氣震撼、新賣戶缺乏、市盤允堅、但通成公司獲利了結、長豐寗波帮抵進、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二·三角、午後開槃仍屬良好、二盤以後、聞現棉交易淸寂稍疲、結果各月比上午收盤價勿動、八月期漲一角、查賣出大孚六千七百擔、聚興一千一百擔、同豐一千擔、生源一千一百擔、大昶一千一百擔、經華二千三百擔、同和一千四百擔、信誠一千一百担、長和一千三百担、買進明德二千祖、恒德一千祖、長豐四千六百担、潤廣四千祖、晉康一千五百祖、源興昌二千一百担、大昌成二千五百担、永大一千六百担、新享一千三百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>英印棉市亦昂</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况呆滯、各月漲一至四磅音、同業等候借欵棉花之進展、交易限於棉商及掉期、五月期雖有若十多頭了結、依然堅定、新棉天氣乾皋、東部大雨、惟投機缺乏、市價無甚上落、收盤前、空戶抵補、同業活動買進、市况堅挺、計現貨漲八磅昔、期貨漲五至九磅音、英棉現貨漲五點、期貨漲二至六點、印棉現貨商買進近月、賣出遠月、並有若干跨買、計平果兩漲一。五羅比、輿姆辣漲〇七五至一·二五羅比、白羅溪漲一·二五羅比、原電錄左、（七日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　洋麥頻漲不已　期粉麥人心帶好</h3>
<p>粉　市上午開盤後、以現粉南北去化均活、洋麥連日報漲、業外人心巳為帶好、適以天氣暖而復寒、且雷雨不止、一般人甚恐有損新麥麥苗、內地帮首先停出、業中浮空立即爭先抵補、而業外大戶叉復吸收、奈出戶觀望、市乃逐盤上升、允以遠期以洋麥不劃、天氣不正、人心允見輿奮云、</p>
<p>麥　市國外電訊繼續報漲近角、而國內現貨不足、業外人心始終望好、昨以天氣不正、補空與新買均活躍異常、而內地行販不復再拋、市乃開價即漲、午後以粉市上升、市氣更見活潑、近遠各月份均見漲起近角、現麥貨主喊高近角、惟廠方尙不肯放價收買、以致全日堅擯未有售開云、</p>
<p>美國小麥、西南作物受損之報吿紛至沓來、但以其他各處有豐登之象、故無甚影響、</p>

<p>標豆收盤衛出六元大關　洋莊芝麻人心亦在看好</p>
<p>標準油豆餅市、突見飛黃騰達、允以標豆漲風最在、因邇日現豆存到兩少、產價步昂、而大連電訊亦復逐日報漲、昨日來電又漲角外、且業外囤戶允恐因國際糾紛而引起油豆之壟斷、故吸收更力，昨上午標車豆巳經激漲一角左右、午後又被現貨與連訊帶好、五月份標豆前日收市五元七角四分、而昨日收價竟衝出六元大關、價至六元零八分、較漲有三角四分之鉅、標油買氣亦旺、價漲四五角不等、標餅亦漲四分左右、洋莊芝蔴近日略有洋商探問、且有裝運漢口應解、人心亦在望好中、昨漲一角九分及一角六分不等、</p>
<h3>河米交易殊形寥落</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、忽然轉稀、共祇到四號、（貨共九百餘石）惟沛積頗多、兼零　銷場淸淡、故人心未見堅昂、而市况亦未有若何起色、摩早粳價無上落、薄稻僅烟台一帮辦、行情亦平、至於杜洋尖及陰變元、皆與上日相仿、　（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船十八九艘、市上各貨去路、白粳高料交易寥落、中决續有去化、市况白粳高貨價疲數分、中决定局、薄稻續有到貨</p>
<p>而零　仍呆、價亦小數分、　社埠到貸無　、銷亦平常。價形定勢、陰元亦定、白元去化尙可、價見緊扣數分、其餘各貨、價形和平之勢、</p>
<h3>客秈忽有汕頭幫問津</h3>
<p>市面賴以維持不堅</p>
<p>咋日客釉市况、去路依然淸淡連日銷路袛有本街單帮問津、客團久乏去化、雖產價高勗、貨主緊持、而市價終難上升、昨日到頭均减、而本街去胃亦呆、市面似有逐步回落之象、但忽有汕頭帮購辦沙漢糙米三百四十包、內地帮亦去暹邊碎米與米酒一百五十包、市面尙能站住、行情則與舫市相似、本街辦去溫州柳米三百包、贛晚一千餘包、價亦無大出入、</p>
<h3>海味　海帶見新尙遠</h3>
<p>—帶絲價亦跟漲—</p>
<p>海帶　因上年產地存額不多、滬市來源稀少、故市價逐步上升、刻下號盤、十勝帶九元八角、根室·濱中·川路·國后·厚坼·等九元二角、鬼莊八元八角、首長八元四魯、貓足八元、擇足七兀八角、二番七元五角、三審六元、聞各當來貨隨到隨通、少見存落、而出新時期、尙需三月、苟客銷不停、市有繼續高漲之勢、</p>
<p>帶絲為料坯漲價、售盤跟上、廂館上等貨、現市非士元零二角不可、大阪貨雙龍牌八元五元、金龍及靑龍牌七元六七角、但貨潮而且粗、低决不堪寓目也、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮青改粗白恐難實現</h3>
<p>昨糖市以關金略升趨勢穩定、惟交易不多未能轉漲、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨二十二元、轉口六元九角半、俱無更動、東赤白亦乏上落、僅八號東白現貨稍有成交、二十一元六角、四號二十一元九角半、本綿白擾記一號二十元六角、錄照退、潮糖號盤開出普通校赤三百餘包、十二元八角至七角、决之略减、其他均無開出、潮靑將改作粗砂白原料之訊、雖有傳說然昨又有不合、改製白糖、猶難實　、</p>
<p>情業合作公司昨又屆標兌之期、計總定額為五千一百叫十八包、均標原價、成交略增、計五牟粗白廣州貨二十一元八角半、售出四百四十包、揚陽貨二十一元六角半、售出三十包、二號五羊綿白二十一元一角、售出二百六十八元、四號叉二十元丸角、售出七十二包、</p>
<h3>南北貸　下檔蜜棗暫見缺乏</h3>
<p>蜜棗下檔貨、近以粵帮去胃活動、時有採辦、以致存底漸見軋缺、價乃略緊、維上檔銷路較呆、無甚上落、昨市高莊徽工秃禿行售二十八元、上下檔照例加退、聞蘭谿貨不日將有到、且天時轉熱、凡身份潮軟之貨、不能久擱者、後市必有變動云、</p>
<h3>雜項　百合片行盤續漲二元</h3>
<p>百合片自市價步漲以來、各方銷路絡繹不絕、以致供不應求、異常堅俏、現在行盤又漲二元、已由二十八元升至三十元、查市上行存巳極單薄、不日恐有斷檔之虞、並聞產區有藥帮採辦、貨亦有限云、</p>
<h3>五金　法會司鐵現貸斷檔</h3>
<p>法國會司鐵、近來市上現貨突然斷檔、致因無貨可購、均拘向隅、標準因之步挺、每箱行情高至三十六元五角、此前漲一元餘、</p>
<h3>紙包鐵開盤又漲</h3>
<p>二百磅紙包鐵咋日開價叉漲二元、每箱沽二十四元、交易廠家方面仍有點綴、客幫因寶交不多、仍少採辦查同業手中現貨不多、而來貨又寡、市勞殊挺、</p>
<h3>絲茶　本年度　出口茶葉檢騐新辦法</h3>
<p>實業部上海商品檢騐局對於本年度出口茶葉檢騐頒布新辦法、其通告云、</p>
<p>一我國茶葉出口貿易、一年衰落一年、雖然道衰落的原因、是多方面的、但是對於茶葉本身的缺少改進、甚至攙雜作偽、也是主要原因之一、如綠茶的著有三魚黃、義記黃等有毒顏料、使和我們為敵的國家、到處在做反宜傳、如水分的過高、常使茶葉能自然地增加重量、不能保持原有的品質、又如包裝的不堅、到外國市塲上、破損的達百分之十左右諸如此類的事情、都是華茶對外貿易致命的打擊、</p>
<p>本局職司檢騐、對於出口每批茶萊、必須經過嚴密的檢查、換句話說、茶葉檢騐的主要目的、在提高對外貿易的信譽、防止劣茶及不良包裝的輸出、所以實業部每年於新茶上市以前、規定出口茶最低標準、和頒布應興應革的事情、作為日常檢騐的準繩、並通告茶商、明暸我們的規定、認真製茶、不致受到禁止出口及其他的損失、本年對於茶葉檢騐頒布的辦法、共有三項、為使各地茶商事先明瞭起見、特將三項規定、寫在下面、</p>
<p>甲　出口茶最低標準一、綠茶、以平水二茶七號珠茶為標準、紅茶、以湖南决紅為標準、其餘各種茶葉、以色澤相當、味香可口為標準、</p>
<p>二、茶葉水分、以不得超過百分之八·五爲標準、但本年度除綠茶依據標準外、紅茶以百分一〇·五為合格、其他茶葉、以百分之一二爲合格、</p>
<p>三、茶葉灰分、以不得超過百分之七為標準、乙著色茶取綿辦法</p>
<p>一、凡商人報騐著色茶、須將所著色料之名稱、詳細塡明、必要時、得令呈騐所用之色料、</p>
<p>二、茶葉著色過濃、與制定之著色標準相同或更重奢、禁止出口、</p>
<p>三、凡使用含鉛·銅·砒·銘·鋇·　·等金屬、（如習用之淡黃、三魚黃義記黃及砂綠等）及其他無機或有機質之有毒色料奢、禁止出口、</p>
<p>內茶箱取絲辦法</p>
<p>出口茶之茶箱、須合下列規定、吾則得令改裝後、方准出口、</p>
<p>一、箱內四角及上下邊綠、須各加釘木條四根、計共十二根、以增茶箱之支持力、</p>
<p>二、鉛箔內壁、須用堅潔紙張、妥為裱糊、使茶葉與紛箔、完全隔絕、</p>
<p>三、箱外須註明茶類、　標、（大面名目）件數、毛重及净重、（新制）採製時期、製茶莊號及地點、</p>
<p>上面三項新訂規定、現再加以簡單的說明、　（一）是出口茶的最低標準是審察內外供需的情形、愼重地定出的、我們希望這種最低標準、能够逐年提高、使輸出國外茶葉的品質、一年年的高起來、以維持我們華茶質美價廉的榮譽、但是爲了內地茶品質的不能改善、道幾年來的最低標準、還不能積極提高、</p>
<p>（二）是茶葉水分標準茶葉水分過高的害處、容易走失香味，不能長久貯藏、前面已經提起過、我們釐訂這個標準、是參考各國檢騐茶水分的規定、和自己經過多少年的試騐、方才决定、檢騐水分的方法、從前用烘箱烘騐的、自本年度起、將採取一種霍夫門氏的新方法、檢騐的結果、將更見正確、這種新的方法、我們將另編說明書、使內地茶商也可自己應用、</p>
<p>（三）是灰分的檢騐檢驗灰分、足以明瞭著色及攙雜的茶葉、因為純潔的茶葉、燒成灰後、牠的重量總不致超出百分之七、如果超過了、茶葉的不純潔、是毫無疑義的、（未完）</p>

<h3>吳江漁父</h3>
<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>話說當年楚平王呌費無忌到秦國去，替太子「建」取了一個妃子回來，這位妃子生得非常美麗，平王看見不覺魂飛魄散，就自己霸佔做妃子，另外替太子建取了一個妃子。</p>
<p>費無忌本是太子建的少傅，因為這件事，大得平王的寵幸。但是費無忌却怕太子建以後登了基殺他，就在平王面前說太子建的壞話，平王惱怒了，就呌奮揚到城父去殺太子建，奮揚却放了太子建，太子建就跑到宋國去了。</p>
<p>太子建的太傅伍奢却是一忠臣，平王也把他捉來關起，呌他寫信去呌他的兩個兒子——伍尙伍子胥來，打算斬草除根。伍尙來了，伍子胥却要替父兄報仇，也跑到宋國去找太子建。</p>
<p>不凑巧，宋國國內發生了內亂，太子建存身不得，就同伍子胥到鄭國去，鄭國待他很好。過後太子建又到了晋國。晉國就的太子建做內應，去滅鄭國，就把鄭國送給他。太子建迷着了，伍子胥勸他他也不聽，就回到鄭國去了。偏偏又走漏了消息，鄭定公同子產兩個人定下計策，把太子建捉去殺了。伍子胥保着太子建的兒子勝，離開鄭國，連日連夜逃向吳國去了。</p>
<p>伍子胥保着太孫勝從鄭國逃生，一路上如喪家之犬，如漏網之魚，這日到了隔吳楚交界不遠的昭關。伍子胥滿想出了昭關，就算得了活命；誰知楚平王已經懸了五萬石的賞格，在到處畫影圖形捉拿伍子胥，這昭關如何過得去！</p>
<p>這一來，伍子胥嚇也嚇極了，急也急壞了：自己一條命不要緊，這保着的太孫勝是太子建的骨血，如果有個三長兩短，豈不絕了太子建的後代！這怎辦呢？</p>
<p>伍子胥左想無法，右想無法，只好暫為在昭關裹面的偏僻地方，找一個人家住下，這一夜把伍子胥的鬍子都急白了。</p>
<p>這一個人家的主人東皋公却是一個俠士，知道伍子胥負屆含寃，就極力替他想法，去找一個同他身材差不多的人來，一道出昭關去，好去混。好在伍子胥的鬍子已經白了，同圖形差了樣，便乘着把關兵士盤詰別人的時候，同太孫勝混出了昭關。</p>
<p>伍子胥出了昭關，恨不得脅生雙翅，飛過楚國的地界，就可以活命，也可以報仇了。走了一些時候，已經看見前面一片白茫茫的大江，過了江，就算吳國的地界了，伍子胥高興得了不得。</p>
<p>誰知，正在這高與的時候，伍子胥巳聽見後面有人吶喊同馬蹄聲，呀！追兵來了！原來，伍子胥混出昭關不久，把關的兵士就知道了，接着便追趕下來前有大江，後有追兵，上天無路，久地無門，急煞了伍子胥。</p>
<p>伍子胥保着太孫勝跑到江邊，呀！那隔江岸不遠，不是漂着一隻打漁船，船頭上不是立着一個長髯的漁父嗎？救星！救星！伍子胥大呌道：「老丈渡我！老丈渡我！」</p>
<p>這漁父也是一個俠義之士，不願意在熱鬧塲中討生活，只在這江邊上打魚為生，到也消閑自在。他在昭關曾經看見過伍子胥的圖形，伍子胥的鬍子雖然白了，但是他還是認得出是伍子胥：他又看見伍子胥背上負了一個寬額豐頤的孩子，知道是一個貴人。為了伍子胥的負屈含寃，這漁父就動了一個行俠作義的念，想耍渡他。但是他遠遠看見了旌旗，害怕就這樣渡他，被追兵看見了，不是耍處，就作歌道：</p>
<p>「日月照耀乎寖已馳，與子期乎蘆之漪。」</p>
<p>伍子胥聽了，已知道漁父的意思，就負着太孫勝，不顧脚下的濘泥，分開蘆葦，一直走到挨近江水的地方，在那裹藏着，等着。</p>
<p>不多久，伍子胥就聽見馬蹄聲，吶喊聲已經到了江邊，那漁父的船還沒有過來，嚇煞了，急煞了，氣也不敢出，動也不敢動，生怕蘆葦梢頭動了，被追兵看見。</p>
<p>伍子胥又聽見追兵們大呌道：「　那老兒，看見有人到這裏來沒有？」</p>
<p>聽那漁父答道：「沒有。」</p>
<p>追兵們又大呌道；「　那老兒，如果你扯謊，待一會兒呌你認得老子們！」</p>
<p>伍子胥聽見馬蹄聲，吶喊聲順着江岸朝右邊去了，漸漸的聽不見了，才把心頭一塊石頭放下，吐出一口長氣，暗想道：「這老丈眞是好人，救了我君臣的性命！」</p>
<p>那漁父又在外面唱歌了：</p>
<p>「日巳夕兮，</p>
<p>余心憂悲。</p>
<p>月已遲兮，</p>
<p>何不渡為？</p>
<p>事寖急事兮將奈何？」</p>
<p>伍子胥聽見歌聲，就鑽出蘆葦，到了水邊，漁父的船，果然靠在那兒。伍子胥背着太孫勝跳上漁船，漁父把槳一擺，船就離開了岸，向江心去了。</p>
<p>白茫茫一片大江水，這隻漁船恰像一片樹葉。漁父只駕着船，不同伍子胥打話，也不看伍子胥。伍子胥的心是比在岸上的時侯安定多了，坐在船裏，漁父不說話，自己不便說話，只獃獃的看着漁父的膀子一前一後的駕着槳。</p>
<p>不過兩三個時辰，已經到對岸，這就是吳國的界上了。伍子胥負着太孫勝上了岸，漁父把船弄好也上了岸，伍子胥正要拜謝，漁父却說：「將軍像是餓了，我取飲食去。」</p>
<p>伍子胥看見這樣，心裹疑惑起來，想道：「老丈這樣慌慌忙忙就走了，莫不是去呌人來捉我不成？但是他要捉我，在那邊岸上，又有追兵，不好捉我，何必又渡我君臣過江來，决不是的。不過老丈這種舉動實在令人生疑，我不免暫為藏起來吧。」</p>
<p>於是，伍子胥拉着太孫勝又藏在江邊的蘆葦裏面去。</p>
<p>少停，漁父拿着麥飯，魚湯來了，在江岸上却找不着伍子胥，知道他對自己生了疑心。江岸上除了藘葦，別處又沒有躱藏的地方，知道伍子胥一定藏在蘆葦裏面，就作歌道</p>
<p>「藘中人！</p>
<p>蘆中人！</p>
<p>豈非窮士乎！」</p>
<p>伍子胥聽見仍只漁父一個人，就帶着太孫勝走了出來。看見漁父手裹拿着飲食，便雙手接過，同太孫勝坐在江岸上吃了。</p>
<p>伍子胥感激漁父得很，就回手把腰間帶的寶劍摘下來，雙手送給漁父，說：「感謝考丈救我君臣的大恩，身旁沒有帶得金珠，只這一口防身的寳劍，送給老丈，略表一點意思。」</p>
<p>漁父不接寳劍，笑道：「伍將軍，我敬你是一個英雄，又負屈含寃，才救你。楚王懸着五萬石的賞格捉你，我都不要，難道要你這一口寳劍。伍將軍，你休小覷了我！」</p>
<p>伍子胥無法，又問道：「請敎老丈尊姓大名，異日也好來報恩。」</p>
<p>漁父不答。伍子胥只得向漁父拜別，又說：「老丈，請你千萬不要吿訴別人！」</p>
<p>漁父咬着嘴唇，瞪着眼把伍子胥看了許久，才說：「伍將軍，你去罷。我死了也不會洩漏的？」</p>
<p>伍子胥同太孫勝走了不上二十步，聽見後面漁父大呌道：「大丈夫不能取信於人，活着有甚麼味！伍將軍，你放心罷，楚國絕不俞知道你到吳國去了。」</p>
<p>伍子胥大驚，回頭一看，看見漁父兩手向天，用脚踏着一邊船舷，只一登，那船就翻了轉來，把漁父覆在下面，一陣水來，連船帶人都冲走了。不覺望着大江，哭拜於地道：「我君臣受老丈大恩？不會報得，却因我一句話要了老父的命。我伍子胥雖萬死也報答不了。」</p>
<p>伍子胥拜罷，自帶着太孫勝往吳國去了。</p>
<h3>列斯特Joseph　Lister（1827-1912）</h3>
<p>— 鄭侃</p>
<p>列斯特·的瑟，是英國的西韓（West　Ham）人。他父親是高視力顯微鏡的發明家。從小，他父親就管得他很嚴，很早就學會了運用顯微鏡，並且曉得詳細觀察和精確記載的必要。</p>
<p>列斯特是個肯負責任和熱情的靑年。他不輕易交友，可是一旦與人相處，便能以肝膽照人。他很佩服和感謝他的父親，立志要利用他父親所發明的工具，做一番大事業來。他常常對着顯微鏡默禱說：「朋友，我一定努力，請你助我成功！否則我不但無以對父，並且無以對人。」</p>
<p>在顯微鏡下，他把淸水也瞧瞧，髒水也瞧瞧，可瞧出了許多活動的小玩意兒來了：有的孑孓似的，兩頭扭，有的蝌蚪似的滿處游，他對於這些小東西，非常有興趣，决意要把牠們研究出個道理來。他就吿訴父親，要進醫學校，研究病菌。他二十五歲那年，得到倫敦大學醫學士的學位。因為他的成續優異，當時那位著名的生理學權威，沙培。威廉（William　Sharpey），便用他做他的外科助理醫生，在大學專門學院的醫院服務。</p>
<p>那時巴斯圖新發明病菌學原理，證明病菌是從外來，不是從死的物質和空氣裏自然生長的，提醒要提防病菌的侵襲。無如當時的外科大夫，大都固執成見，迷信「自生說」。有些還閉着眼晴，連顯微鏡也不看，瞎猜傷口之所以腐爛，是因為空氣中的氧氣在傷口裹發酵的緣故外科醫生走進病房去施手術的時候，他不但手不洗，用具不消毒，並且特地揀一伴髒衣服穿去。因為病房太髒了，乾净衣服會被牠沾污。他說：「手何必洗呢，等一會施手術就弄髒了；器具何必消毒呢，牠是無時不和毒接觸的。」病菌得到縱容，於是在人不知不覺中，四處蔓延起來了。病人彼此傳染，病室污穢不堪，一切東西都可以做傳染病菌的媒介。因此留醫的病人，卽使有輕傷的，也會變成重毒了。醫院裹流行一種「醫院疽」，病人十九是死於此症的。</p>
<p>那時醫治創傷的通行療法，是先用悶藥把病人悶失了知覺，後用猛烈的藥，燒去疽肉。籌到病人醒過來，發覺新創比舊創還厲害，總是呌苦不絕。往往過了幾天，創傷週圍顯出灰色薄膜，成了一個不治的症，早晚便該死了。但是這樣的治療法，有時也會把病人醫好的。病人冒險受治，總比聽「發院疽」侵襲，束手待斃的好。</p>
<p>列斯特一當了外科助理醫生，就注意到這燒灼的治療法。他想：「創傷怎能可以燒好的呢？一定是在創傷裏的致病根苗被燒絕了。那致病根苗是什麼呢？如果我能把牠找出來，並且能想出萬全的方法把牠消滅或隔絕了，這豈不是一伴造福人類的大發明嗎？」於是他把有病的腐肉，放在顯微鏡裹考騐，發覺其中有活動的微生物。他假定這一類的活動東西是致病根苗，但因瞪據不足，還不敢下結論。過了不久，沙培介紹列斯特去見當時一位最有名的外科醫生，賽姆·詹姆士（James　Syme）。賽姆和他談話，曉得他是一個精明而有毅力的靑年，留他在愛丁堡老病院當外科助理醫生，給他一切研究的便利。</p>
<p>列斯特生性是非常慈悲的，他在病室裹工作，看見多數病人都死於「醫院疽」，心裹很難受，四處去找救濟方法。他各種科學的書都讀過了，什麼道理也找不出來。最後他讀到巴斯脫的論文，看見巴斯脫所發明的菌學原理，驚喜非常，拍案歡呼道：「我得到答案了，醫院疽有法子救濟了。」他本來早已假定創傷腐爛是由於病菌作怪，得到巴斯脫的理論與證明，更知道他的假定是眞理了。</p>
<p>可是剛知道有病菌這樣東西，而找不到消滅牠的法子，列斯特還是無法可想，奈何它不得；他苦心焦思去想法子。怎樣能殺除創傷裹的病菌，和防北外來病菌的侵入，現在是他最嚴重的問題了。他試騐了幾個月，全歸失敗，心裏非常苦悶和焦急，他不斷的自問道：「難道我就這樣不田息，一種殺菌的藥品還發明不出來嗎？」</p>
<p>有一個早晨，他的頭腦很淸醒，心平氣和地想道：「急有什麼用呢？有冷靜的頭腦才能研究呀，否則當前有很大的道理，也摸不着呢。」他抬頭看見天色澄碧無際，三五飛鳥很自得地在天空裹翱翔着。他忽然像有所感，伸長　子遠望道：「郊外一定更有可觀，我何不出去玩一天。也許我太過疲勞了，跑累了的馬，會連驢也比不上的。說不定我今天休息一天，明天便能發明一種滅菌的東西來。」於是他馬上準備到郊外旅行去。</p>
<p>他嘴上雖然這樣說，心要還是難忘他的工作，才遊了半天，便跑回來了。他回到家要來，看見他的園丁正在淸除暗溝，把石炭酸倒進溝裏去消除臭氣，他忽然想出道理來了。他想：「石炭酸能悄除臭氣，一定是牠能殺死令水發臭的微生物。我何不就試用牠做殺病菌的防腐藥。」</p>
<p>他第一决試用他的防腐藥，就得到很大的成功。剛好那時有一個小孩被馬車輾傷了腿，斷骨已經穿破腿皮突出來了。列斯特拿浸過石炭酸的布和他包裹，好好地把斷骨接合復原。小孩的腿結果並不潰爛出膿，也不惹着醫院疽，不久便痊愈了。這是一伴空前的奇蹟。後來他用他的防腐藥醫好了許多人，他所管理的病室從此就不發生醫院疽了。賽姆看見列斯特這樣有功醫學界的大發明，非常滿意，薦他替代自己做愛丁堡大學的外科醫學敎授。</p>
<p>當着列斯特施用石炭酸做腐劑之初，他的同業都極力攻擊他，說他是「烏鴉裝成孔雀」。後來他們看見列斯特的方法確有奇效，不能不用牠，不由得不拜服了。列斯特並不因此便滿足了，還是繼續努力研究防腐藥。經過多年的研究和改良，結果製成今日最完善的防腐藥，雙衰化鋅和衰化汞藥膏。</p>
<p>巴斯脫五十生辰那一天，世界科學家，紛紛到巴黎來替他祝壽，列斯特也親往道賀。巴斯圖一看見列斯特，高興到忘形，在萬衆歡呼中抱着列斯特，眼裹含着戚激的淚，嘴唇囁嚅着，像要說：「你和我是一個人。我的發明是你的，你的發明是我的。」</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3>兒童讀物的商榷</h3>
<p>— 周寒梅</p>
<p>中國兒童是最缺少敎養的，我想道句話大概沒有十分過火吧？都市中的孩子，「人馬牛羊」沒有識得幾個，「中發白」的麻雀牌却巳琅琅上口；鄉村中的孩子，一天到晚生活在淤泥溝中，一點敎養也談不到，這是從地域而言；至於貧富之間呢？那麼貧苦人家的孩子根本沒有受敎養的機會，富貴人家的子弟却在父母溺愛的懷抱中葬送了一生。說中國兒童是缺少敎養的話，也許還是十二分讓步的呢。</p>
<p>比較地談得上受到些敎養的，當然是知識份子的家庭了。在賢明的家長指導之下，總是要選探些有益的兒童讀物給他們去閱讀。中國出版界方面的兒童讀物，據筆奢看來，還是建築在這一般家庭上面的。</p>
<p>如何可以使中國的兒童都得到正當的敎養？這問題雖與兒童讀物有相當的聯緊，不過並不在本文討論之列，現在想把現有的兒童謮物，加以一點批評和貢獻。</p>
<p>時代是不允許我們按步就班的行進了，一切的一切，都需要飛躍的前進，兒童讀物又何能例外？倘使一般的兒童讀物在這非常時期之下，還是講一點神仙的故事，牛哥哥馬弟弟的對話，這未免創造了一個兒童的樂幽在天堂上，而不是在這現時現地的中華民國的人間。因此，編製現代的兒童讀物的原則，據筆者的見地，第一，應該是順應兒童的心理和生理，編製各種非常時期的讀物給兒童們去閱讀。譬如「飛機的故事」，「戰爭時的孩子」，「爸爸穿上軍裝了」等，道都是絕好的兒童讀物的題材。我們要把戰爭時的常識編製成各種有趣的故事，我相信在兒童的興味上，也許比神仙月亮姊姊的題材要高明得多了吧！要知道兒童們的好寄性固然很豐富，但故事的現實性更重要，難道我們還以為仙人的故事比天空上翱翔的飛機更能博得孩子們的喝采嗎？同時有一部份兒童讀物最好與玩具聯繫起來，醫如飛機的製造法等，一定能使兒童們更感到興趣。第二，編製兒童讀物時應顧及地方性，現在的兒童讀物和小學校的敎科書都犯有同樣的毛病，就是編輯先生是生活在都市憂的，他看到的是都市裏的一切，因此編製的題材也訊之於都市中的各事各物，於是道讀物在都市中尙可適用，在鄉村裹的孩子們却莫明其妙了。以中國幅圓之廣，文化程度之相差甚鉅，各地的需要當然也絕不一致，那麼編製一種兒童讀物希望全國的孩子們都能讀能懂，喜歡讀，當然是一件辦不到的事，所以編製兒童讀物之第二個原則，應顧到各地的地方性的不同。第三，那就是價格問題了。我覺得兒童讀物之所以不能普遍，中國的孩子們所以缺少敎養，讀物定價太昂也是一個很大的原因，一本兒童書報往往要大洋一角，這在購買力薄弱的中國兒童家長們，祇得忍痛割愛了，所以目前的兒童讀物，大多銷售於全國各小學的圖書館裹，兒童們是很少直接定閱的，這對於中國的出版界與中國的兒童們，同樣受到了一個很重大的打擊，所以筆者認為出版兒童讀物的第三個原則，是儘量减低定價，抱薄利多賣主義。</p>
<p>中國這一代的孩子們是在苦難的命運中掙扎，我們負有敎養兒童天職的大人們，應該多多創造些福利給他們阿！</p>
<h3>「讀中國生產敎育問題」（二）</h3>
<p>— 白沙</p>
<p>甲，經濟觀—以生產敎育是養成經濟的生產的敎育。</p>
<p>乙，社會觀—以生產敎育是一種發展社會生產的敎育。</p>
<p>丙，職業敎育觀—以生產敎育為職業敎育的化身，或為其一部分。</p>
<p>丁，人文敎育觀—以生產敎育為訓練「生產之人格」的敎育。</p>
<p>戊，勞作敎育觀—以生產敎育相當於勞作敎育，或為其一部分。</p>
<p>已，科學敎育觀—以為生產敎育就是科學敎育。</p>
<p>至其目標，歸納起來，可以得到三個：一，了解社會生產的意義；二，訓練社會生產的技術；三，培養社會生產的人格。</p>
<p>第四章是實施生產敎育的條件，歸併為內在的條件與外在的條件兩大類。前者要抵制國際侵略：剷除封建勢力；安定社會秩序；統一政治事權；穩固經濟建設與改造社會心理。後奢須改革敎育制度；培養指導人才；　籌實施經費：置辦生產設備。這些條件，若不具備，生產敎育雖可勉强設施；但不會收良好效果。</p>
<p>第五章是實施生產敎育的原則：一，不可只是妄動和嘗試，應通盤籌劃。二，不可專事抄襲，要因地制宜。三，不可專重生產結果，更當適合敎育原理。四，不可浪費生產，必適合經濟的原則。五，不可離開生產而實施生產敎育，應在生產塲所實施生產敎育。六，不可紙上談兵，必須在生產活動上實施生產敎育。</p>
<p>第六章是各地生產敎育實施狀况。首述實施機關。各敎育機關，雖有類似生產敎育之實施，但以農村改進機關為多；中小學多附於勞作科內。决述生產敎育活動事項，概可分為農藝，畜牧，工藝三類。再述實施方法，社敎機關則注重展覽，宣傳及表證；多級學校，則注重敎育方面之實習與設計。至於指導人員與實施經費，只見到資格的混雜不堪，和經費的多寡懸殊。故欲求生產敎育之完善，必須遵照第四章所述的六原則。</p>
<p>第七章是結論，先將各章作一提要，次述本書的建議。</p>
<p>我們贖了本書以後，對於生產敎育的理論與實施，可以得到一偭明確的烏瞰。因為牠是熔生產敎育的理論與實際於一爐的。對於各地實施情形，可以得到一個輪廓。</p>
<p>牠在每章之末，都有一段簡要的結論，使讀者閱讀以後，可以得其綱領，體會書中要義，不致有囫圇吞棗之弊。假使讀者以時間所限，不能全讀，那麼讀其每章結論與全書結論，即可得其要義。</p>
<p>書中每節的意義，假使非著者所寫，都把牠的出處註出來，如讀者要深知其詳，可以展閱原書，不致有東翻西找的痛苦。</p>
<p>附錄一是各國生產敎育實施狀况，詳述俄德意美日最近實施狀况，牠不但可供參考，並可作為借鏡。所謂「他山之石，可以攻玉」的功勞，也可以盡點義務了罷！</p>
<p>附錄中又有論文索引與專書索引，把關於生產敎育的理論與實施的論文，搜維殆盡。使研究生產敎育者，可以觀其索引，便無須到處尋找材料，有覺貧乏之苦。</p>
<p>這本書的寫出，牠雖然出於各專家之手，但是文字的流暢，編制的劃一，以及那材料的綱舉目張，都如出自一人之手，於此也可見本書的價值了。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>犯罪與經濟問題</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>事實吿訴我們，社會上犯罪案件的發生，大部分都和經濟有關係。允其是在目前這畸形的社會組織下，經濟問題，更是造成犯罪行爲的主要因素。林主席在國府紀念週報吿：接閱司法院呈送最近在監入犯統計表，計男女人犯總數六萬零七百四十五名，所載罪名，的可分爲四類：第一類是關於强盜等罪，計犯人三萬一千三百零九名；第二類殺傷罪，計犯人九千三百六十九名；第三類妨害風化和婚姻罪，計犯人三千五百七十二名；第四類鴉片嗎啡罪，計犯人七千五百九十四名；此外危害民國罪及內亂罪犯，二千一百十一名；其餘屬於其他各種犯罪。從這個統計表，我們可以看出，各省在監六萬餘名犯人中，有三萬多人，其犯罪是直接起因於經濟，佔人犯總數二分之一。其餘第二，三，四類，雖罪名或爲殺傷，或爲婚姻嗎啡，若一推其犯罪原因，恐亦間接和經濟問題有關係。這是一個値得我們注意的重大問題！</p>
<p>人類生活是脫不了要受經濟支配的，衣食住就是三件不能缺少的生活必需品。便因為這樣，故一個人當其生活發生困難的時候，為滿足生存的慾望計，往往要挺而走險，幹出那犯罪的勾當。這卽是社會上一大部分罪犯事件所以產生的由來。我們每天翻開報紙一看，盜竊，刦攫，綁架等等新聞，差不多無日沒有。這還是被發覺的，已經有這麼多。其餘未經查出的，案件之多，更可以想像得到。以近年來農村崩潰，工商業衰落，整個經濟陷於極度恐慌，社會上因迫於生計而犯罪的事情，更是層出不窮。據林主席報告，若以民國二十年同樣統計比較，二十年的强盜及海盜罪，為二千五百餘人，而最近的同類犯罪，是一萬四千五百餘人，約增加六倍。二十年犯懲治盜匪例者六百人，最近有五千餘人，增加八倍左右。這現象更是怎樣的嚴重！這顯然是說明國民生計的日趨危困！</p>
<p>對於目前我國這種犯罪案件加速增多的事實，我們要用什麼方法應付呢？這時必須考慮的問題。當局者所能做到的，只是施行法律制裁的一法。然而今日的犯罪事件，是靠懲戒所可消滅的嗎？老子說過：「法律滋彰，盜賊多有。」有效辦法，還是設法給一般饑餓者找一條生路！因為這是解除生活壓迫痛苦的維一途徑。吾則消極的法律制裁，是阻止不了犯罪行爲的發生的。</p>
<h3>回家</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>—海航的故事—</p>
<p>照例貨船經過大瀝圩的時候，如果是三老爹通氣歇一夜，我們都可以一道回家走一趟的。不知怎樣，船走入溝口，心便有點癢，很象不靠岸便放不下心似的。老七更瘋得厲害，到這時候通常他便象走在熱鍋上的螞蟻，跳呀跳的一點精神也沒有。</p>
<p>這一次，在大瀝圩卸完了貨已經差不多日落得平了，大家都氣噓噓地，又心急，又疲倦。好容易三老爹紮一紮褲脚走到圩里去一個什麼「打老虎」的地方抽雅片，我們才又一夥兒跳上了船，唱呀唱的走上回家的道路。老七第一個興奮，他敎我們：</p>
<p>「明天爛契天未光便回船。死笨七，晏一點多快活一點啊！」</p>
<p>老桂從來便看不起他，而且老桂實在也有點怕回家，——一回家黃臉婆又得來嚕哩嚕蘇，不是要錢便是問從梧州帶了桑寄生回來沒有。帶你祖宗十八代，桑寄生？便是樹枝也帶不了一條回來</p>
<p>到大鎭村的村口是差不多吃晚飯的時候了。我們便分頭：老桂向左拐向那神高神大的汝南公祠的那邊走，我和老七也手携着手走右邊小門入。沒走多遠，孩子們便看見我們，笑嘻嘻地衝出來。七嫂是一個很壯健的女人，老七不在家，她也和姪子他們合耕五畝田，一年四季便是這樣「好天晒，落雨淋」地勞碌着。但，有時她也有很壞的皮氣，愛罵人，也愛說入閑話，我們大夫里的人都說她是「喊街婆」。</p>
<p>我拍一拍老七的肩頭，便走入自家兒屋了。老媽媽在燒着飯，妹妹和姊姊在繡花。她們除了織布，揀爆竹賺一點錢外，便靠了我的。——可是，說到我才天曉得。</p>
<p>「海，回來咧？」很象出乎意外的，怪親熱的樣子，在下間里媽喊了我一聲。我也照例應了她一聲。之後，她便吩附妹妹：「給哥倒茶咧，你哥辛苦了咧……」這樣，她便又忙碌着預備晚飯。</p>
<p>我疲倦得要命了，膝頭很象給誰敲了一下重的在痛。順着勢倒在炕床上，妹妹怪有趣地拿了一張從紙烟盒里抽出來的畫紙給我看。我這時心里很難過，我不經意地用手在袋子里算一算從梧州回來剩下來的錢——兩個雙毫，和十七個銅仙。我在迷迷地想，也不知在想什麽……</p>
<p>「海，吃飯咧。」</p>
<p>機械地我在吃飯了。忽地街前傳來了七嫂那「喊街娑」鬼呌般的聲音——「你個衰佬，要你拿錢來養家，不是餓死了都得嗎？出去了一頭半月，走一水船，碎錢也不帶幾個回家，還有臉孔回來。如果是我便跳到白鵝潭里去死了。……一次回來說等下一次，不要等你的孫子長大了才發達吧，你的話才有鬼信！……走那些黃瘟船，賠命便有份，要賺錢眞要投胎轉世了。衰佬，死黃瘟，監　！」</p>
<p>媽嘆了一口氣。姊姊的蒼白的險孔輕輕地抬了起來，兩只無神的眼珠呆瞪着我。我頭有點昏，我象受了錐刺那末難過，我再吞不下這些媽媽，姊姊和年輕的妹妹用血換來的飯。我走到床邊，躺下了，香沉沉地睡過去。耳邊聽到姊姊在說：</p>
<p>「他太辛苦了，你看他……」</p>
<p>很莫胡，我不願聽下去，我的腦海映起了一幕一幕的悲劇，我的身體在發燒，做了很多噩夢，醒來時天還沒亮，頭還很重而且隱隱作痛。走到下問澆水洗臉時，從窗眼里看見媽媽已坐床邊帶着老花眼鏡替妹妹補破釘。不知怎樣地我走進了媽媽房里了，妹妹還睡得很熟，姊姊却已老早起來繡花。</p>
<p>「海，好點了嗎？你昨夜在不斷地誦夢話哩。」</p>
<p>慈愛的話語象箭一樣射傷了我，從袋里把所餘下來的錢，一個不剩地放在媽的床邊，頭也不回地便走出她的房間，口里很吃力地說着：</p>
<p>「媽，我去！……」</p>
<p>跑回船上來的時候，太陽才從水面里升起。</p>
<h3>桐梓</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>六點多鐘，太陽還高高地掛右山角上，山腰上的田畝投浴在夕輝裏，齊整的行列，壯實的穗子，有着靜恬的風姿，像甜睡去的美人呵！</p>
<p>到新站，我們歇在李家棧裏，這地方的棧房，是不講什麽名號的。不，不用說交到了貴州的邊界是如此，從上路以後，隨便住在那一個鄕鎭上，能够把客棧戴一頂帽子的，究竟還是極小數，大部的，都是老板的姓代替了帽子。這，在伕子們的心頭，是記得爛熟的，什麽地方的×家店，房子有幾間，什麽行情，或許老板是怎樣的一個人物，都淸楚的刻在心上。</p>
<p>新站的地方雖則不大，却具備了兩家大棧，李家棧與王家棧。</p>
<p>眞的，在山路上，伕頭的預測，是不能不欽佩的，他們能算計着當天的行程有多遠好走，夜晚必定的要歇在什麽地方，其他像在什麽地方早飯，那裏有茶亭，踏途上那裏好走，那裏比較險耍，這些，像一部家書，全部的裝在他們的肚子裏。</p>
<p>啟行的早晨，趕在一個輕快的柔和的日子。</p>
<p>在悶頭菁，計算着是走出了全天路程的半數了。得了，不要讓殘餘的菜滓帶進了山城吧，今晚，無論怎樣，總能有些東西喂一小乾癟的肚腸的。於是，我們把提盒裏炒好的鹽菜還有一點辣醬擺出來，不像往日一樣的珍惜了，一轉眼，都送下了食腔。</p>
<p>一過楚米舖，空氣在我們的心頭有了另一種的感覺，想到幾個鐘頭以後我們將離開了這苦難的行程，開始和古老的城池接觸了，怎能不驚喜呢？新的企望，新的探索，一切都將陳列在我們的眼前，好，等待着事實的開展吧！於此，我們唱着不入調的京戲，大鼓，小曲以及歌謠，滑杆緩慢的進行，過路的客人睜大了眼睛瞧着這怪異的動作。</p>
<p>——先生，你唱這叫啥戲？</p>
<p>——九腔十八調，樣樣都有。</p>
<p>——這眞是難得聽見的，不自然的笑一下：小地方是沒有們這些的呵！</p>
<p>我們承認，那並不是謊話，在短短地人生裏，成長於山地的他們，又那裏能聽些外省的雜碎呢？</p>
<h3>提倡消毒運動　消滅人類大敵</h3>
<p>— 急進</p>
<p>各種傳染的微菌，盈千累萬，或是散在汚濁的空氣當中，或是留在不潔的飲食上面，因爲菌體微小，人的且力不能看見，所以牠隨時都能侵人人的體內，致人死命！</p>
<p>微小的毒菌一年能殺人幾千萬，請大家趕快聯合起來，消滅人類的大敵，那麽就要使用殺菌滅毒的唯一利器「亞林沙而」，（五洲藥房出品）</p>
<p>「亞林沙而」的主要成份「可利沙而」，富有殺菌消毒的功效，無論日常沐浴洗手，不可不用，倘是有皮膚病和瘡　等等，用了立見功效，我們爲了要謀人類的健康，唯有提倡消毒運動。</p>
<h3>萬古流芳</h3>
<p>— 景仰</p>
<p>現在某大戲院映的一張「萬古流芳」的影片，這是描寫一個科學界偉人盡瘁一生發明醫術造福人羣的故事。</p>
<p>從這故事上我便想到了淋病，淋病直到現在，還沒有特效的療法，雖然市間治淋藥品有拿「××博士發明，幾小時奏效，一盒斷根……」這些大話來誇張引誘，但這無非是劣藥投機，實在違反醫藥的道德。</p>
<p>新藥「的立平」出世以後，它並沒有怎樣的宣傳，可是它實際却獲得了很大的成效，因爲它對於利尿，鎭痛，殺菌，淸濁，都能逐步收效而達全愈。</p>
<p>「的立平」在療治淋病的歷史上是有地位的，它也自有其流芳萬古的價值吧。</p>

<p>傍晚，遠遠的看見了依山而築，桐梓縣城，蛇似的蜿蜒着，灰黑的城墻，和我的故鄉許不會有多大的參差罷。</p>
<p>進了城，把行李先落卸在一個什麼棧裏，播一回算盤珠，伕子們應得的工資都交給了伕頭，自然，另外還得有一些犒賞。呼麼着，他們都去了，沒有理會今天以後的生活。</p>
<p>飯後，將一切的物件淸點一回，又遷移到靠近中心地點的宜賓旅舍。</p>
<p>九點鐘打過了，老張頭扶了那根不能分離的手拐到這裏來，要求着搭乘我們定備的長途汽車晉省，好减輕他一筆費用。今夜，他的談鋒很健，他吿訴着我們關於桐梓的許多事蹟，也談論到許多絕不相關的瑣碎的事，十一點，他才走。</p>
<p>明天起個早，先流覽一下全城的景色吧！我有這樣的一個私願。</p>
<h3>東京什碎</h3>
<p>— 雷石榆</p>
<p>（二）燒鳥·阿丁·燒蛤</p>
<p>一入黃昏，有些街上，突起一座一座的營幕似的東西，那帆布映出很朦朧的燈光，走近時一種膾炙的味道薰出來，那進口垂着幾條寫着「燒鳥」的骯體的布簾。別因爲牠太便宜趨步而過。那裏面有很好吟味的東西啊！</p>
<p>桌子上有一個錫盤或什麼東西盛着一串一串的豬肝啦，豬肚啦，所謂「燒鳥」的麻雀似的宰得乾乾凈掙的赤裸裸的鳥。還有一瓶的日本酒，芥醬，醬油或其他什麼東西。</p>
<p>歡喜吃那種由你自擇，肝，肚什麼的一錢乃至二錢（日幣十錢當一角）一串，一隻小鳥要三錢以上。裏面的主人，有的夫婦倆，有的只一女或一男，他聽你的指示把一串一串的放在炭焰熊熊的火爐上滿排着一根根的鐵條上面來炙，一面用扇煽着那炭火，一面翻置着那一串串的東西，他認爲够火時，便拈起來往醬油盎裏一浸，你可接過來，就那麼樣站着大嚼特嚼了。</p>
<p>滋味怎樣呢？那是依各人的味覺去判斷，但在我想來，把一次進咖啡店的錢來吃一個月這樣的東西，是很經濟而且保證充飢的效能的。聽說「燒鳥」是日本食物的有名而且特色之一。</p>
<p>但有的也不一定在街邊張幕來做生意，就在自己的小小屋子裏也可開盤的，只要那門口也掛幾條寫着「燒鳥」兩字的布簾。</p>
<p>因為自己頗愛吃這種東西，所以對於那樣的地方也識得不少，但認爲弄得最適口的，算是定橋區諏訪町的一家，名字可不記得，但很容易找到，因爲他的門額上掛着一幅他自己的畫像，那畫像也很肖而且特色，只四五十歲的人長着那麼長長的一把關公鬚：由兩耳朶根直至下巴都是濃密地黑得發光似的五六寸長的鬍鬚。據他說，他在台灣做過許多年生意。他常常用一兩句中國話來表現他的滑稽的。</p>
<p>因爲我只藉訪友的機會去「光顧」過幾次，但他的眼睛像有先天的特種構造似的，第二决他就問起前决的事來。</p>
<p>「阿丁」舖也和他的「燒鳥」舖一樣，大槪都是把自己的家的正堂門地劃出來做這種生意的。所不同的是用字母寫上那布簾，和裏面另種風味的食物。那食物是這幾種東西：蘿蔔，豆腐，雞蛋，……混合在一個鍋裏煮，你喜歡那樣她就把牠筴上來放在一個盤子上給你吃。那裏也有廉價的酒，喝不喝是由你的。甚至有的，也有櫈給你坐，那更寫意了</p>
<p>我從前住在神田區時，就找到這樣寫意的一間。而且老太婆的家裏有兩位女兒，怪親熱地招待的。允其是那長女差不多每决都彈「三味綫」給我們聽，有時也哼幾句什麼曲的。</p>
<p>至於那些食物的價錢：每塊蘿蔔和豆腐二三錢左右，鷄蛋一個五錢，這似乎不很普羅的。</p>
<p>「燒蛤」是蚌，蜊，螺之類的東西，弄法也和「　鳥」一樣，不過不用翻置，因爲把殻剖開放在那裹煎煮到可以爲止。價錢比「阿丁」更不便宜，一個蜊子要三錢左右，蚌，螺則五，十，十五錢不等，以大小而定。但牠的味道，勝過前兩種，這當然是依自已的味覺而判斷的。</p>

<p>蔡筱舫毛家書</p>
<p>中西（一〇四〇）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇「釵頭鳳」</p>
<p>多情却是總痴情。薄命紅顏自古云。我蕙仙，幼失椿萱無依靠。伶仃養媳到陸鬥。姑表訂婚原屬義。一家歡樂度光陰。更喜表兄情亦重。喃喃小語話溫存。恨只恨，尼僧不空貪寡化。悔只悔，婉詞諫阻結仇深。釵頭鳳，碎落豈有意。惹出非常禍不輕。播弄無非圖報復。世間可殺是尼僧。讒言進母將奴害。萬苦千辛委曲承。姑怒不消心更變。竟使我，空門獨處受欺凌。惡尼賤業曾誘到。爲守貞操誓不遵。良人何知遠赴試。愁腸萬種向誰評。郎雖歸來幸見面。益悲傷。蓮花並蒂已難成。可憐我，得賦斷腸豈忍讀。可憐我，珠淚點點</p>

<p>羅襟。可憐我，思前想後難入夢。可憐我，反覆終宵睡不奪。可憐我，憔悴容顏怕對鏡。可憐我，纏綿床第病眞成。可憐我，曇花夫婦終泡影。可憐我，忍淚含悲勸郎君。可憐我，陸氏宗　頻在念。可憐我，鯤絃應續再可嚀。可憐我，絕而復甦婆婆喚。不能定省侍晨昏。愿姑且把愁眉展。須恕媳婦不孝名。自歎孽綠宿世定。折磨何必怨他人。只望蒼天知我意。人生聚散本浮萍。甘心瞑目赴幽冥。</p>
<p>徐文壁開篇</p>
<p>航業（一一八〇）十一時一刻至十二時</p>
<p>開篇「孝子」</p>
<p>爹娘養子愛如金。多方保護萬分勤。時時刻刻抱在懷。牽腸掛肚不安心。恐兒太飽還防餓。更憂冷暖不均勻。倘然孩兒染疾病。恨不得將身替兒身。如同刀割心腸痛萬分。佳餚美果兒先食。冷飯殘餚父娘吞。有食必先留子食。有衣必定子先輪。人生縱有貧和富。養育孩兒一樣恩。自幼養爾成人大。爹母費盡萬般心。到老全憑依傍靠。肉食豐衣供養親。不離左右侍殷勤。恐怕那。只因看待妻兒重。少有功夫願老親。世間那有鐵心人。勸君快把爹娘孝。不孝椿萱何爲人。古來孝子多多少。細細一一說分明。虞舜大孝天心格。象爲耕田烏爲耘。父母頑囂常欲害。虁夔齊粟化雙親。漢文帝仁孝臨天下。薄太后三載疾病侵。湯藥親嘗衣不解。朝夕無倦慰娘心。孔子弟子曾參孝。客至家中無措陳。母咬手指子心痛。急忙負柴轉門庭。跪母前吿禀問原因。周朝閔損子騫孝。廬衣體寒失牽靷。老父聞知休後母。伏地求吿留繼母身。子路仲由孔弟子。爲親負米百里程。後來親沒身榮歸。父母共享恨不能。郯子天性順至孝。父娘惟思鹿乳吞。身衣鹿皮與鹿伍。幾乎中箭命歸陰。言不稱老老萊子。彩衣兒舞娛雙親。睡地上效學子孩戲。年高父母笑盈盈。漢代董永家貧苦。賣身葬父感天神。槐陰樹下逢仙女。織縑完時贖取身。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>萬人渴望的「欲望」</h3>
<p>星期五起映於大光明</p>
<p>瑪琳黛德麗的熱情潑刺，久爲影迷所熟悉，製片當局，也就利用她這特殊的性格，源源不絕的產生出成績優越的作品來。她在銀幕上的誘惑力，也不知激動了多少觀衆的心弦。派拉蒙最近出品的「欲望」ESIRE一片，當然還是去盡量運用她的天才。劇情係叙述一個行竊的女郞，彼愛情的動力所感化，啟發了改過爲善的智能。全劇即以一串竊來的珍珠項圈及兩人戀愛的始末，爲縱橫的主力描寫。黛德麗飾梅蒂琳，出場時扮一女騙子，面部及衣飾的化裝，均極適合，舉止亦甚婉轉神秘，在後與湯姆鍾情的過程中，演得更加纏綿熱烈。賈萊古柏自主演「洞房花燭夜」「戰地英魂」等片子以後，名震影壇，近目被擁爲好萊塢的大情人。這次和黛德麗繼「摩洛哥」後再度合作，扮演一個純潔熱情的靑年湯姆，形容出祈求愛情安慰的處男心理，前後都能細心描摹，誠不愧爲表情聖手。導演鮑才祺，是一個浪漫主義和傷感主義者，其處理「欲望」的精湛手腕，確足驚大，再加劉別謙的監製，更如錦上添花。這片子已定於星期五起映於大光明，的確是一部値得介紹的好片子。</p>

<h3>「浪淘沙」小言</h3>
<p>聯華第一部對白有聲片「浪淘沙」，爲美國最新式之收音機收音，而錄音者又爲極富經騐之鄺贊君，故發音之淸晰嘹亮，爲國片所罕有。</p>
<p>「浪淘沙」題材偉大，演出方式新頴有力，可爲今日影壇造一新紀錄。</p>
<p>金燄在此片中，表演之吃重，演技之優異，爲三年來所見之最大成功，故凡電影觀衆，不可錯過此片。</p>

<h3>「化身姑娘」野乘</h3>
<p>— 白木</p>
<p>「化身姑娘」的編劇者是名電影理論家黃嘉謨，彼在此劇中不僅採取了一個嶄新的題村，同時更在電影形式及技巧方面開闢了一條極新頴的路徑。</p>
<p>導演人是方沛霖，在過去他是中國電影界數一數二的優秀佈景人材。這裏他運用了纖細的藝術手法來處理這一部神秘奧奇的戲劇，因此無論從那一方面來說，「化身姑娘」都獲得了非常優美的成績。</p>
<p>袁美雲在劇中即是那位一化象姑娘」，因着劇情關係，一會兒變男，一會兒變女，行踪　忽，捉摸不着。</p>
<p>王引是飾袁美雲的情人，但起先彼因不知袁美雲實爲一女子，所以會鬧出了不少的笑話</p>
<p>周璇是痴心追求袁美雲的，但後來當她知道袁美雲的秘密時，是很傷心地哭了一頓。</p>
<p>韓蘭根飾袁美雲的堂兄，一隻嘴比貓還要饞，因此笑話百出，奇趣橫生。</p>
<p>全劇中當推王桂林發見袁美雲秘密時的一個鏡頭，最够神秘和刺激。</p>
<p>許曼麗，秦桐，姜修，葉文秋，趙曼娜也都有極超越的貢獻。</p>
<p>攝影是姚士泉，畫面的美麗，光綫的柔和，增加戲情力量不少。</p>
<p>總之，「化身姑娘」是一部新感覺影片，不久就可以和諸位相見於銀幕上了。</p>

<h3>Tension Regarding the Anti-Communist Issue; Hebei-Chahar Diplomacy Gradually Unfolding; The Puppet Organization in Eastern Hebei May Soon Be Abolished; Yin Rugeng's Future is Under Contention</h3>
<p>Japan Proposes Establishing a Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Committee, but We Do Not Agree</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Eastern Hebei issue has recently made progress through negotiations conducted by authorities in Tianjin. Yongjian is expected to return from seeking instructions in Tokyo on the 12th, at which point a solution will be determined. The abolition of the puppet organization is expected to be realized within three weeks. Currently under discussion is Yin Rugeng's future. The name of the war zone may be fundamentally changed, and a special district may be established, with a chief official in charge of administration, under the jurisdiction of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. Yin's possible appointment to this position remains a point of contention. Matsumuro is about to go to Tongzhou to meet with Yin to discuss the matter. The Chahar issue is also being discussed. However, the outcome will depend on the anti-communist situation. Although the heads of the six counties, including Zhangbei, have been appointed by the Chahar authorities, they are unable to exercise their powers. The Hebei-Chahar diplomatic authorities expressed optimism on the 8th regarding the former two issues, stating that the tension surrounding the anti-communist issue has, conversely, facilitated progress. Reports of setbacks are inaccurate. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A prominent figure indicated that regarding anti-communism in Hebei and Chahar, the Japanese side proposed establishing a Sino-Japanese Anti-Communist Committee and concluding an anti-communist agreement. We did not agree, believing that this would only increase the burden on the people and would not be of practical help. Therefore, after thorough negotiations, it was decided that we would rely on our own strength to combat communism, without relying on external forces, to avoid the loss of sovereignty and the invasion of our territory. Concrete measures have been finalized, and implementation will begin after Yongjian's return. The Japanese side is paying close attention to this matter. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Two-thirds of Hebei's newly recruited security teams have already been established and are currently undergoing training in Peiping. After three months, they will be organized and deployed to various counties to take over defense duties. Existing county militias will be screened, with the weak eliminated and the strong retained, before being transferred to Peiping for training to become elite forces. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet Eastern Hebei government is constructing 1,000 barracks in Tanggu, intending to station 4,000 security troops there. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Jinde Society issued a proclamation to all elders in the province, urging them not to be incited by the Communist Party. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Qin Dechun Visits Matsumuro; Matsumuro's Office Established Today</h3>
<p>(Peiping) Matsumuro's Peiping office is scheduled to begin operations on the 9th. Matsumuro will also move to the Eastern Legation Quarter. The Foreign Affairs Committee will begin negotiations with Matsumuro on the Hebei-Chahar diplomatic issue within days. Qin Dechun visited Matsumuro at the Fushang (Japanese) Embassy at 10:30 this morning, for a forty-minute discussion. In addition to a return visit, there was also some discussion on current affairs, but it was merely an exchange of personal opinions. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Luo Jiaheng returned to Peiping from Tianjin last night and visited Matsumuro at ten o'clock this morning for a routine courtesy call. Luo stated that the Hebei-Chahar Special Commissioner's Office will not be merged. There are more sporadic diplomatic incidents in Chahar Province. Passports for foreigners traveling or residing there have traditionally been jointly issued by the provincial government and the Special Commissioner's Office. There are still local affairs to be handled, so the Chahar Public Office will not be abolished for the time being. The Peiping Office will be taken over after meeting with Special Commissioner Cheng to determine a date. In the future, I will remain in Peiping and work in conjunction with the Foreign Affairs Committee on local diplomatic matters. Local opinions will naturally be respected. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Hebei-Chahar Political Council Takes Over the Former Political Reorganization Committee's Goods and Files</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan Will Not Return to Peiping in the Short Term; The Transportation and Construction Committees Will Be Established Soon</p>
<p>(Peiping) The Hebei-Chahar Political Council, following an order from the Executive Yuan, has dispatched secretaries Zhou Hannan, Guan Jinxi, and Zhang Wenzhong to take over the goods and files of the former Political Reorganization Committee. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Song Zheyuan will not return to Peiping in the short term because he needs to tour various counties in Hebei Province. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Transportation and Construction Committees are scheduled to be established in Peiping on the 15th. Each committee will have nine members. It has been internally decided that the chairman of the Transportation Committee will be Chen Juesheng, and the chairman of the Construction Committee will be Men Zhizhong. The orders will be announced soon. The two committees will be responsible for planning and researching water conservancy, roads, telecommunications, and power lines in the two provinces of Hebei and Chahar. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Song Zheyuan will return to Peiping next week. Xiao Zhenlu plans to go ahead of Song next week to meet with Matsumuro to discuss Hebei-Chahar diplomatic affairs. The Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Economic Committee is planning to be abolished after the committee concludes its research on economic issues in order to save funds. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei-Chahar Political Council's Economic Committee has dispatched personnel to investigate the causes of economic bankruptcy in various rural areas, intending to implement emergency relief measures and designating the Hebei Provincial Bank and the Chahar Provincial Bank to provide loans. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhu Zheyuan telegraphed requesting that the North China Agricultural Cooperative Affairs Committee be placed under the jurisdiction of the Hebei-Chahar Council. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce principally agreed and will proceed with the transfer after consulting with the Economic and Transportation Committee on transfer procedures. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-Shek Visited Wuhan Yesterday to Inspect Political Affairs, Returning to Nanjing in About a Week; The Hubei Authorities Prevent Student Activities</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek left Nanjing for Wuhan on the 8th to inspect political affairs in various provinces and will return to Nanjing in about a week. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yang Yongtai and Chen Jicheng were ordered the night before last to dissolve the Hubei Provincial Student National Salvation Federation. Chen went to Nanjing on official business. On the morning of the 8th, Shen Jingdu, Chief of Staff of the Police Department, crossed the river to visit Yang and discuss implementation measures. However, because the federation's address and meeting locations were not fixed, and its general affairs department was located at Central China University, with representatives from Wuhan University and nine other schools serving as directors, Yang, Shen, and Education Commissioner Cheng Qibao discussed the matter and decided that the provincial government and the police department would jointly issue a proclamation. The police department would also issue a directive to agencies with public security responsibilities to strictly prevent the federation's activities. On the other hand, the Education Commissioner convened a meeting of principals and faculty members of secondary and higher schools in Wuhan at 3:00 p.m. on the 8th, ordering them to persuade students to obey orders, focus on their studies, and not be incited or manipulated by a few impure elements. Yang, Shen, and Cheng also scheduled a meeting with the federation's responsible personnel on the 9th for instructions. Furthermore, the Police Department invited the press for a discussion at 3:00 p.m. on the 8th, with Shen attending to explain the process of being ordered to dissolve the federation. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hubei Provincial Police Department, on the 8th, was ordered to dissolve the Hubei Student Federation and issued a proclamation stating: "Regarding the Executive Yuan's telegram (Yuan Er Dian) of the 6th, it has been found that the Hubei Provincial Student National Salvation Federation is an organization established under false pretenses by a small number of impure elements and has not been approved by the provincial party headquarters. According to confidential reports, the federation has been holding secret meetings and expressing distrust in the printed documents issued by the central government, openly opposing the principles of our party, clearly manipulated by the Communist Party in an attempt to incite the youth. If strict measures are not taken, incidents are bound to occur. In addition to informing the Central Ministry of Public Training and the Ministry of Education, you are hereby ordered to strictly prohibit the federation from holding meetings and to dissolve it immediately to eliminate the source of trouble. By order of this directive, all students in schools above secondary level in Wuhan and all agencies under the jurisdiction of this department must comply without fail." (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hubei Merges Administrative Regions</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Hubei Province was previously divided into eleven administrative regions. Now, as banditry is gradually being suppressed and many highways are nearing completion, the province has specially re-allocated and merged the regions into eight. The breakdown is as follows: 1. The original regions one and two are merged into one region, with the commissioner's office located in Puqi. 2. The original regions three and four are merged into region two, with the commissioner's office temporarily located in Xinchun and another office established in Shian. After the remaining bandits are eliminated, it will be relocated to Huanggang. 3. The original regions five and six are merged into region three, with the commissioner's office remaining in Suixian. 4. The original region six, Mianyang, Qianjiang, and Jiangnan counties are merged into the original region seven and renamed region four, with the special hospital remaining in Jianglu. 5. The original regions eight, nine, ten, and eleven are renamed regions five, six, seven, and eight. The above measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan upon submission by the provincial government. (8th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Case of the Soviet-Mongolian Protocol, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Protest Has Been Delivered to the Soviet Government; The Soviet Ambassador Does Not Wish to Express Opinions Before Receiving Instructions From His Government; The Japanese Government Adopts a Wait-and-See Attitude</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest to the Soviet Union regarding the Soviet-Mongolian agreement has been forwarded to the Soviet government by the Russian ambassador. The Soviet Embassy in Beijing does not wish to express any opinions on this matter before receiving instructions from its government. (8th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese government considers the conclusion of the Russian-Mongolian mutual aid agreement to be an act of trampling on international agreements. Chinese Foreign Minister Zhang Qun stated to Consul General Suma that the agreement is a violation of the Sino-Russian Beijing Treaty. Zhang also stated that China has lodged a serious protest with Soviet Russia. The Japanese government believes that China will inevitably adopt an attitude to break the Russian-Mongolian agreement and has decided to temporarily observe the situation quietly. (8th Allied Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the Russian government's announcement of the Russian-Mongolian aid protocol has a significant impact on Japan's national defense. The Japanese government is now studying its impact on Japan with a cautious attitude. According to the general opinion of the government, the purpose of the Russian-Mongolian aid treaty is to legally establish Soviet Russia's control over military affairs in Outer Mongolia, which is quite obvious. The clause in its first article, "When there is a threat of attack from a third country or government," the governments of Soviet Russia and the Mongolian People's Republic "shall immediately consider all necessary means," openly indicates that Soviet Russia will attack the enemy before being attacked itself. The so-called "defense against attacking the enemy" is a blatant expression of the Soviet military's offensive intentions. The Soviet government also secured the right in its second article to provide military and all other assistance to Outer Mongolia when it is subjected to military attack by a third country. Its intention is to use the Red Army within Outer Mongolian territory in times of war against Japan, in order to attack the Japanese army from the side and rear. Therefore, the second article of this treaty clearly targets Japan, and the Red Army is in an offensive posture. With the conclusion of this treaty, Soviet Russia has further intensified its aggressive stance and will openly station its superior forces in Outer Mongolia in the future. As a result, the border of "Manchukuo," which has weak security forces, will be under constant threat. In short, Soviet Russia has obtained military control over Outer Mongolia through this treaty, and Japan and "Manchukuo" have no choice but to take countermeasures.

<h3>The Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Agreement Was Announced Yesterday by the Moscow Government</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to a Moscow report, the Soviet government announced this morning the military mutual assistance agreement concluded on March 12 of this year with the government of the Outer Mongolian People's Republic. The content generally states that if one of the contracting parties is attacked by a third country, the other party shall immediately provide military assistance, etc. (8th China Joint News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic signed a draft of the mutual assistance agreement in Kulun on March 12. The signatories were Soviet Plenipotentiary Representative Tylezov and Mongolian People's Republic "Small Khural" Chairman Amur and Premier and Foreign Minister Genden. The full text of the draft is as follows:</p>
<p>The Soviet government and the Mongolian People's Republic, now due to the friendship between the two countries, have been unwavering since 1921, when the Mongolian People's Republic, with the help of the Red Army, drove the White Guard troops who were in contact with the invading Soviet territory army out of the Bogu territory, and because both countries are willing to maintain peace in the Far East and continue to consolidate the existing friendly relations between the two countries, it has been decided to formally revise this draft, which already existed in the gentleman's agreement of November 27, 1934, stipulating that they will provide each other with full assistance in order to avoid and prevent armed threats, and to assist each other when any third country attacks the Soviet Union or the Mongolian People's Republic. For this purpose, we have signed this draft.</p>
<p>Article 1: If the territory of the Soviet Union or the Mongolian People's Republic is threatened by an attack by a third country or government, the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic shall immediately consider the situation together and adopt various methods necessary to defend and protect the territories of both countries.</p>
<p>Article 2: The governments of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic recognize that when one of the contracting countries is subjected to a military attack, they shall provide each other with various assistance, including military assistance.</p>
<p>Article 3: The governments of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic consider that when the troops of one of the contracting countries are stationed in the territory of the other contracting country in accordance with the mutual assistance agreement in order to fulfill the obligations of Article 1 or Article 2, they shall withdraw immediately when it is no longer necessary, just as the Soviet troops withdrew from the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1925. This is self-evident. Article 4: This draft has two copies, one in Russian and one in Mongolian, both of which have equal validity. This draft shall take effect upon signature and shall continue to be valid for the next ten years. (8th Tass Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Authority of the Two Mongolian Political Councils Established</h3>
<p>The Areas Under Their Jurisdiction Have Also Been Specified</p>
<p>(Nanjing) There is much misunderstanding outside about the authority issues of the Bailingmiao Mongolian Political Council and the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council. Today, the reporter specially consulted a certain key person who is familiar with Mongolian affairs. According to him, the establishment time of the two Mongolian Political Councils is different, but their authority is independent and they are both under the Executive Yuan. The areas under their jurisdiction are also clearly stipulated in the organizational outline of the two councils. The Bailingmiao Mongolian Political Council has jurisdiction over the Zhuhuilin Geler League and the leagues and banners in Chahar Province. The Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council has jurisdiction over the Ulanqab League, the Yeke Chao League, the Shimo Te Banner, and the five counties in eastern Suiyuan and the four banners on the right wing. Therefore, the authority is clear, and there is no superior-subordinate relationship. As for the relationship between the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Council and the Suiyuan Provincial Government, they are also in an equal position and are not divided into superiors and subordinates.

<h3>Commercial Depression in Northern Chahar</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a Zhangjiakou report, since the six counties in northern Chahar were occupied by Li Shouxin's puppet troops, all the county heads in each county have been replaced, and a Japanese adviser has been set up in each county. The inspection of the people traveling back and forth with the outside world is very strict, especially for those who are allowed to leave the pass, and they are forced to collect traffic taxes from merchants. For example, if a merchant from one county wants to do business in another county, he must obtain a passport from the local county government and pay a passport fee of 50 cents. Merchants suffer such harsh treatment and are reluctant to move forward. Therefore, department stores are expensive, commerce is declining day by day, and the people's food is extremely worrying.

The bandits served as officials and gang leaders, and the people were under their command." The county heads were ordered to inform the people that all those who were forced to become bandits and encountered our bandit suppression troops on the front line could surrender and would not be held accountable.

<h3>The Significance of Promoting School Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Capital</p>
<p>As the international situation becomes increasingly turbulent, our country's people, long weakened by illness, are gradually realizing that without strengthening the body, there is no way to build a nation, and without military preparedness, it is difficult to seek survival. For a time, physical education movements are flourishing. Also, people's labor services and civil servants' training have been successively established as regulations and implemented. The methods to pursue physical fitness are improving daily and changing monthly. However, it seems that our countrymen still do not pay enough attention to general health and daily care, and are not making efforts to improve. Even focusing on schools, the complex subjects and difficult theories are already enough to engage the students' minds and occupy their thoughts. Even during the occasional rest period, they are still burdened with extracurricular self-study. At the end of each semester, they are extensively constrained by examinations, with little regard for whether the students' mental capacity can handle it and whether their physical health has been compromised. As a result, even if those with high aptitude are cultivated and they do not feel ashamed of their broad knowledge, those with slightly lesser talents will inevitably become weaklings. This is the drawback of those who have been eager for fame and success since ancient times and who have a bias in favor of this goal. How can this be what is expected of today's education that seeks holistic development? This is why the National School Hygiene Technology Conference convened in Beijing, using a scientific standpoint to plan for educational improvement. The majestic proposals and ardent discussions are all comprehensive and hit the nail on the head. In addition to feeling delighted and gratified, we cannot but discuss this issue.</p>
<p>Looking at the proposals of the School Hygiene Conference, such as the seven items for regulating children's mental hygiene, the request to educational administrative officials to entrust capable academic institutions to research and improve the subject time arrangement of middle school entrance exams and primary school spot exams, the suggestion to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health to establish standards and unified methods for university entrance examinations, and the regulation that urban school hygiene should be the responsibility of teachers, etc., all are able to perceive the inconvenient circumstances of students and provide them with practical and reasonable relief, aiming to remove obstacles to health and pursuing what is best for the students. We have no objections. However, regarding the point in primary school that extracurricular activities should not be assigned separately, we believe this is the most important plan. Nowadays, most primary schools arbitrarily increase the amount of homework when children return home after school, ordering them to submit homework the next day. There are endless assignments, such as labor, diaries, arithmetic exercises, and calligraphy practice. Reviewing lessons is not even included. The family may even praise this as strict supervision. The school authorities also boast of the thoroughness of the curriculum, without realizing that the children's physical and mental well-being are being harmed. We really do not understand what the school life is like in those six hours a day in the classroom. If the school only wastes time and relies on home self-study to compensate, then how can the teacher's responsibility be justified? If not, then children's fragile minds are inherently difficult to concentrate on trivial matters. After a long day of being constrained, they are already tired and want to rest, yet they still want to seize the opportunity to be lively and play, making them continue to engage in work with their heads buried. Not only does it damage their health, but how can it benefit their education? Last year, Ms. Chen Hengzhe had an article titled "Save the Middle School Students" published in the Ta Kung Pao. Every time we read it, we cannot help but sigh. Middle school students are already in such a state, let alone primary school students who should not be burdened with such onerous tasks. Now that the Hygiene Conference has this resolution, it is truly a unique and insightful view. We sincerely hope that the educational administrative authorities can use an official order to promote it practically.</p>
<p>Furthermore, improving hygiene is a key plan for strengthening the body and building the nation. Intellectuals are the pioneers in advocating for trends. If schools, where intellectuals are concentrated, still cannot use the spirit of science to seek practical improvement, then the general situation will naturally lag further behind. Promoting school hygiene directly aims to improve the physical health of young people, and indirectly, it is to cultivate the recovery of the nation's vitality. Furthermore, with the power of the majority, it can spread awareness everywhere, so that the whole country can be inspired. The far-reaching significance of this is certainly not just a local issue.</p>
<h3>Chen Guangfu and Others Visit American Authorities to Discuss Financial Issues; Purpose of Trip to America is Not to Negotiate Loans; No Changes to China's Monetary Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chinese banking leaders and economic experts, including Chen Guangfu, General Manager of Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and Director of the Bank of China, Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, and Gu Yiqun, Assistant Manager of Shanghai Zhongfu Bank, have come here for inspection and have begun meetings with Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau to seek a deep understanding of the financial policies of China and the United States. The Secretary announced today that he invited Mr. Chen to the United States to seek opinions on general monetary policies, so the conversation time may be very long. A spokesperson from the Chinese Embassy said that China will continue to sell silver to the United States and that the United States will continue to purchase newly mined raw silver. Mr. Chen said that he came here to discuss general financial issues worldwide, not to borrow money from the United States. China's currency management system has been very successful, so there is no intention to change it. According to reliable sources today, the US Secretary of the Treasury asked Mr. Chen about China's currency plan and its operation. The entire meeting today was devoted to discussing this issue. The next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday morning. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Chen Guangfu, General Manager of Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and Director of the Bank of China, and Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, accompanied by Shi Zhaoji, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, recently visited Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau. Afterwards, Ambassador Shi announced that the purpose of Mr. Chen and Mr. Guo's visit to the United States was not to negotiate loans, but because the Bank of China will soon establish a branch in New York to enhance the financial relationship between China and the United States, so they came to the United States for inspection. Ambassador Shi also said that China's currency reform has been successful, and at this time the Chinese government does not intend to change its monetary policy or link the Chinese currency to the US dollar or British pound. According to what he knows, the United States does not intend to purchase silver from China anymore. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Times Comments on China's Currency Reform</h3>
<p>The Results Are Far Better Than Expected; Japanese Suspicion Will Naturally Disappear</p>
<p>(London) The Times recently published an article commenting on China's currency reform, stating that since the Chinese government implemented the currency reform plan, the results have been excellent and the progress smooth, far exceeding expectations. Even the banks established in Shanghai by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Belgium have transferred the silver currency stored in these banks to the Central Bank of China. The credit of Chinese banknotes is like this. Only Japan has suspected that this policy adopted by China was encouraged by the United Kingdom, which is a misunderstanding. Judging from various facts, this suspicion is indeed unfounded. "At that time, Japan accused the United Kingdom of conspiring to loan money to China and manipulate China's currency system in order to exclude Japanese forces in China. Today, people generally recognize that this accusation is completely unfounded. As far as the new monetary policy is concerned, although some people may have regarded it as harmful when it was first adopted, when it is effectively implemented, this mentality will naturally gradually disappear. This is the case in Japan, and it is the same in other countries," etc. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>Two Beautiful Young Women in Military Uniform Ride White Horses on the Battlefield; They Sacrificed Themselves for the Country</h3>
<p>Another Page in the History of Blood and Tears of the Northeast Volunteer Army</p>
<p>(Changchun) The People's Revolutionary Army Second Army under Wang Detai, affiliated with the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, has recently repeatedly defeated enemy troops in the area of Huadian, Dunhua, and Sandaogouling in Jilin Province, with great momentum. Two beautiful young women in military uniform riding white horses participated in all planning in the army, which is a special feature. The army recently fought with the Japanese and puppet troops in Yaodianzi, the fifth district of Huadian County. Due to the disparity in numbers, they were taken advantage of by the enemy. Five people were killed and ten were captured. Among those killed was Li Xuezhong, the political director of the First Independent Division of the army. It is regrettable that one of the aforementioned beautiful young women in military uniform riding white horses was killed and the other captured. (Hualian Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Chiang, the Director-General of Anti-Opium, Issues an Order to Strictly Investigate Government Officials Smoking Opium; Those Who Do Not Smoke Within Two Months Must Provide a Written Guarantee; Those Found to Be Smoking Will Be Dismissed or Punished</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Director-General Chiang issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments on the 8th, and submitted it to the National Government to be forwarded to the various departments and commissions, to strictly investigate party, government, and military service personnel who smoke opium. The original order stated: "Party, government, and military service personnel are the models for the people. Smoking opium has long been prohibited. At this time when the anti-opium policy is being vigorously implemented, all those who have a habit of smoking should severely reflect on themselves and quit as soon as possible. However, it is feared that those who smoke opium in secret may still not be able to avoid it. It is urgent to conduct strict investigations in order to enforce the anti-opium policy." It is now based on the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Anti-Opium Association, "Cases of Investigation and Prosecution of Party, Government, and Military Service Personnel Who Smoke Opium and Drugs", and has drafted four implementation measures, which are considered feasible. All party, government, and military service personnel nationwide who do not smoke opium or drugs should follow the method of written guarantee and conduct a general investigation. The responsible leaders of the various departments should be responsible for executing the guarantee process for their subordinates. They should collect written guarantees from all levels of officials under their jurisdiction, compile a summary table, and submit it to this Chairman and Director-General of Anti-Opium for verification. If it is known that someone has a habit of smoking but has recently quit, they should have the supervising official provide proof, and the supervising official should secretly report it to the higher supervising official and secretly mark it in the summary table for verification. In addition to the amendment to the Rules for Verification of Civil Servants, which will be issued separately, a copy of the investigation measures and a sample of the written guarantee summary table are hereby issued for compliance. The investigation measures are: 1. The investigation period is set at two months. 2. Within the first month, each person should provide a written guarantee stating that they do not smoke opium or drugs, and submit it to their direct supervisor for stamping and verification. Within the second month, the competent authority should compile and forward it to the general investigation agency. 3. If, after providing the written guarantee, it is discovered or reported and verified that someone is smoking drugs, the original agency will immediately dismiss them or send them for punishment.

<h3>Donating Airplanes to Celebrate Chiang's Birthday; Chiang Believes That Proportionate Donations Are Inappropriate</h3>
<p>Hoping that those in charge… avoid any coercive methods</p>
<p>(Nanjing) All sectors are donating to purchase airplanes to celebrate Chairman Chiang's fiftieth birthday, which is currently being actively carried out in various places. According to Chen Bulei, director of the Second Division of Chairman Chiang's Adjutant's Office, Chairman Chiang does not want any celebrations for his personal birthday. Because the purchase of airplanes is a gift to the country, he does not want to express anything for the time being. It is now reported that some places are using organs to apportion donations according to salary, which Chairman Chiang believes is very inappropriate.

<h3>French Memorandum on Reply to Germany Published; Suggests Dividing into Political and Economic Parts; Advocates Establishing Lasting Peace in Europe</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government has recently published two accompanying memoranda, one is a reply to the memorandum submitted by Germany on March 31, refuting the reasons on which the country based its abolition of the Locarno Pact, and the other is a peace plan. The first memorandum has been sent to the other signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, namely the governments of the United Kingdom, Belgium, and Italy. The second memorandum has been sent to each of these countries, as well as to the League of Nations. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) France has now published a reply to the memorandum presented by German leader Hitler on April 1 regarding a new European peace plan. What has been published is a 13-page memorandum, which is divided into 25 sections detailing France's proposed declaration. The political section contains a proposal to organize a European Committee, advocating that obligations already undertaken should not be changed within 25 years. It also suggests establishing an international army and large-scale disarmament. The economic section discusses monetary stability, credit expansion, and market control. The final provision is that any event must be carried out within the League of Nations organization. French Foreign Minister Flandin and Minister Without Portfolio Peng Gu will inform other countries' representatives attending the Locarno Pact signatory countries' conference in Geneva of their decision on Hitler's memorandum.</p>
<p>The main point of the preamble to the French memorandum is: "Peace must be comprehensive and lasting, peace must have equal rights, peace must have trust in all parties' honor and respect for promises, and peace must be based on international trade, replacing economic nationalism competition to achieve stability." The declaration contains 25 sections, two of which specifically address "no hegemony," stating that lasting peace cannot be achieved if dominated by the needs or ambitions of the people, and the security of international relations cannot be achieved if disputes are not resolved by impartial interpretation and binding international law. Mutual assistance must be stipulated by local treaties. It also states that treaties must not be considered immutable forever, but they must also not be unilaterally abandoned.</p>
<p>Under the title of political measures, the French reply declares that Europe is a local unit. If Europe is too large to apply mutual assistance and disarmament to collective security, then it may be possible to organize local agreements and local treaties regarding the independence of various countries, and various armaments restrictions should be placed under explicit mutual guarantees. Various sanctions, even the use of force when necessary, should be adopted to uphold international law. Countries within the scope of Europe should set up special armies, navies, and air forces, under the command of the League of Nations or the European Committee. The European Committee has permanent management rights over the implementation of treaties within its scope. In terms of disarmament, the extent of armament restrictions in each country should be decided by a two-thirds majority of the European Committee or other League of Nations organs. Each country has the right to appeal to the Supreme Permanent Arbitration Committee established by the League of Nations Administrative Council. The French reply also states that the demilitarization of the Rhineland is the only security guarantee for Europe. Germany does not want to be placed in the International Court of Justice at The Hague because it knows that its reasons will inevitably be rejected. Germany is unwilling to make the necessary gestures to contribute to the efforts of reconciliation with the other signatory countries of the Locarno Pact. Germany's peace plan is unfortunately only a contribution in name. What France wants to know is whether its proposed Western air treaty includes air force restrictions. Without restrictions, this is completely worthless. Germany's plan is completely insufficient to fix peacetime. Even if Germany rejoins the League of Nations today, it will inevitably withdraw from the League of Nations again if its demands for colonial rights cannot be satisfied. (Reuters Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>First Memorandum</h3>
<p>(Paris) France has published its memorandum in response to Germany's memorandum, known as the First Memorandum. Its content is divided into ten points, refuting one by one the reasons cited by Germany for abolishing the Locarno Pact. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After the German government abolished the Locarno Pact on March 7 and sent troops into the Rhineland, the rule of law in Europe was undermined. To avoid international disputes, France did not take appropriate measures to immediately restore the original situation, but instead engaged in talks with the other signatory countries of the Locarno Pact, hoping to preserve the possibility of an amicable solution. The signatory countries of the Locarno Pact also considered Germany's dignity and presented a draft proposal on March 19. However, Germany considered it detrimental to its honor and failed to grant it equal rights, and therefore rejected it. In fact, no one had damaged Germany's honor, nor had anyone withheld equal rights. Furthermore, although Germany agreed to return to the League of Nations, it still demanded that the League of Nations Covenant be amended beforehand.</p>
<p>(2) The German memorandum discussed the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland from a historical perspective, stating that it conflicted with the Fourteen Points proposed by the late US President Wilson. In fact, when the Paris Peace Conference discussed the disarmament of the Rhineland in 1919, the German delegation never protested. The Locarno Pact was freely signed by Germany after the Allied forces withdrew from the Rhineland. Germany unilaterally abolished it, citing as its reason that the Treaty of Versailles was signed under duress, and that the Locarno Pact failed to revise the clauses in the Treaty of Versailles related to German territory. Therefore, Germany has the right to refuse to respect certain clauses in the Locarno Pact (namely, those concerning the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland). However, one cannot help but doubt the value of any treaty Germany might sign in the future, leading to the conclusion that Germany will raise issues regarding the current system of the Free City of Danzig and the autonomous region of Memel, demand revisions to the current borders of some European countries, and demand the return of its original colonies. Germany should clearly answer all these questions.</p>
<p>(3) Although Germany believes that the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact conflicts with the Locarno Pact, the other signatory countries of the Locarno Pact have not raised any objections. Germany's refusal to seek a ruling from the International Court of Justice in The Hague indicates that its reasons are insufficient.</p>
<p>(4) The signatory countries of the Locarno Pact are prepared to negotiate based on the proposals put forward in the German memorandum and to establish a new agreement to replace the Locarno Pact. However, these countries are unwilling to conduct any negotiations based on "faits accomplis." Moreover, after Germany abrogated the treaty, it repeatedly refused to compromise, resolutely rejecting both the withdrawal of some of the troops stationed in the Rhineland and the construction of defensive fortifications in the area. How can there be any possibility of conducting negotiations?</p>
<p>(5) Although the German memorandum has put forward various peace proposals, they can only be considered after Germany provides guarantees and is willing to fulfill its promises. "The demilitarized zone of the Rhineland is not only related to the security of France and Belgium, but also to the interests of all of Europe. After the abolition of this system, how should it be remedied? The German memorandum does not provide any promises." We believe that the extent to which Germany adheres to the principle of collective security can be seen in whether or not Germany builds defensive fortifications in the Rhineland.</p>
<p>(6) The proposed non-aggression pact in the German memorandum is far from complete. This pact plan fails to incorporate a collective security system and is also incompatible with the proposal to conclude mutual assistance pacts with Eastern European countries. In addition, Germany is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and should not use war as an instrument of national policy. Even if a non-aggression pact is concluded in the future, how can it add to its original obligations? In short, France rejects any approach that divides Europe into eastern and western parts and only considers the security of Western Europe.</p>
<p>(7) France welcomes Germany's return to the League of Nations, but given its recent actions, the threat of a second withdrawal from the League cannot be prevented. As for Germany's proposal to establish an international arbitration court, it directly denies the authority of the International Court of Justice in The Hague and the Council of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>(8) The German proposal on disarmament does not contain quantitative or qualitative restrictions on land and air forces. While the issue of humanizing war is reasonable in itself, its effectiveness would be much greater if a mutual assistance system could be advocated to deal with future aggressor countries, so that war would not occur in the first place.</p>
<p>(9) France does not reject the proposal to promote relations between France and Germany, and will do its utmost to achieve this goal. The League of Nations is also attempting to achieve spiritual disarmament.</p>
<p>(10) France fulfills its international obligations at all times and does not need to amend its current constitution. On the contrary, maintaining peace must begin with mutual respect for rights and mutual cooperation in order to be effective. When disputes arise between countries, it is inappropriate to seek solutions independently with neighboring countries and disregard the principle of collective security.</p>
<p>"In short, the current state of European power politics must be recognized without reservation, and the status quo in Europe must be preserved through a system of mutual assistance. The German memorandum to the British government does not mention a single word about this." (Havas dispatch, August 8)</p>
<h3>Second Memorandum</h3>
<p>(Paris) In addition to submitting the First Memorandum to respond to the German memorandum, France also submitted a Second Memorandum, detailing a peace plan, stating first, "What the government of the French Republic is proposing now is to achieve universal, complete, and lasting peace by safeguarding the honor of all countries, fulfilling the promises of all countries, respecting the equal rights of all countries, and encouraging international trade, and to move from effectively limiting armaments to reducing armaments, in order to achieve true peace."</p>
<p>This plan is based on the following principles: equality of rights, respect for international obligations. The French government believes that peace cannot be expected if it is based on the needs and desires of various nations. International rule of law should have compulsory and adequate safeguards. Hegemony is not allowed. The French government believes that all countries may freely relinquish part of their sovereignty under certain circumstances, especially under the issue of armaments, and that universal mutual assistance pacts may be concluded to remedy any disparities in the military strength of various countries.

<h3>Talks Between the Three-Nation General Staffs - Selection of British Representatives</h3>
<p>Strong Opposition Sentiment in the Lower House Remains</p>
<p>(London) The British representatives to participate in the talks between the three-nation general staffs have been appointed: Major General Dill, Major General Amison, Colonel Ismay, Colonel Paget, and Sir Andam, totaling five persons, with Major General Dill as the chief representative. He is an outstanding talent among the younger British officers, having served as the principal of the General Staff College and an instructor at the Imperial Defence College. His knowledge and talent have always been highly respected in military circles. (Havas dispatch, August 7)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the talks to be held between the British, French, and Belgian general staffs, Foreign Secretary Eden made an explanation to the House of Commons last Friday (the 3rd), stating that the measures that can be decided in these talks will only be effective during the period of general negotiations between the countries concerned. Their nature is purely technical, so politically it will not increase Britain's obligations, and the defence organizations of the countries concerned will not accept any constraints as a result. After this explanation, the atmosphere in the House of Commons seemed to have cleared up, and even those who most strongly opposed the principle of the talks seemed to have dispelled their doubts. Unexpectedly, when the House of Commons met this afternoon, opposition Labour MP Frychin and extreme Conservative MP Churchill successively raised questions to Prime Minister Baldwin on this issue, indicating that opposition sentiment towards these talks in some quarters of the House of Commons is now on the rise again. The following is a summary of the questions and answers between Frychin, Churchill, and Prime Minister Baldwin: Frychin asked, "Can the Cabinet provide assurance that the preparations for these talks are being made by the Cabinet and not the general staff?"</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied, "The Cabinet has always closely monitored these talks. I have already told the members of the House of Commons this."</p>
<p>Frychin asked, "Can the Cabinet provide assurance that British military secrets will not be leaked?"</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied, "The military officers of our country who are handling the affairs of the general staff talks are well known to me, and there will definitely be no leakage of secrets."</p>
<p>Churchill asked, "Regarding military secrets, is there a situation where one side leaks secrets and the other side does not?"</p>
<p>The Prime Minister replied, "What do you mean by 'secrets'? I really do not understand." (Havas dispatch, August 7)</p>
<h3>Border Adjacent to Germany - Austria Enhances Defence</h3>
<p>Preventing Covert Agitation by the National Socialist Party</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to reliable sources today, the Austrian government has greatly strengthened the defence of the border with Germany to prevent a National Socialist revolution instigated from within Germany, and has prohibited the smuggling of arms across the border. For several weeks, the smuggling of arms into Austria has suddenly increased. Two murder cases occurred in Graz last week, which were clearly politically motivated. Local authorities said that the Austrian National Socialist Party instigated these murders to retaliate against defectors. It is also learned today that a batch of arms destined for Hungary was seized in Linz. Therefore, it is generally believed that it will be very difficult for Austria to control the international activities of the National Socialist Party in the future. Officials said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has indicated that if the National Socialist Party invades Austria, Italy can provide military assistance. However, the government believes that even with Italian assistance, it can only resist for a few weeks. Therefore, Austria very much hopes that Western European countries will express their attitude on this matter. (National Telegraph, August 7)</p>

<h3>Thirteen-Nation Committee Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss the Use of Poison Gas by Italian Troops - Britain and France Form an Opposing Stance</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Thirteen-Nation Committee held a closed-door meeting to discuss the Italian army's use of poison gas in Abyssinia. According to British Foreign Secretary Eden, the 1925 convention stipulated that the use of gas was absolutely prohibited, and both Italy and Abyssinia were signatories to the convention. French Foreign Minister Flandin called on both Italy and Abyssinia to begin peace talks, which have been going on for five weeks, but have not yet started. Is Italy prepared to start these talks? It is now time to know. The meeting was adjourned until 4:00 p.m. today. It is reported that League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol inquired with the Red Cross to see if the Red Cross could provide any evidence regarding the Italian army's use of poison gas in Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch, August 8)</p>
<h3>Thirteen-Nation Committee Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss the Use of Poison Gas by Italian Troops - Britain and France Form an Opposing Stance</h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the Thirteen-Nation Committee met here today, British Foreign Secretary Eden questioned the committee as to whether it knew anything about Italy's use of poison gas. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol replied that there was no evidence to show that this was true. Eden also said that the use of poison gas was prohibited by the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which Italy had signed, and should not have knowingly violated it. At this point, the French Foreign Minister stood up and demanded that the League of Nations investigate the Abyssinian army's use of dumdum bullets and the arbitrary killing of Italian prisoners. From this, it can be seen that the positions of Britain and France in Geneva have formed an opposing stance. The committee adjourned at 4:00 p.m. so that Spanish representative Madariaga and Avenol could inquire with the International Red Cross about this matter. The Mexican representative sent a letter from London to the League of Nations protesting against the League of Nations' delay in imposing sanctions on Italy, and stated that Mexico was unwilling to bear the responsibility for weakening collective peace. According to general observation, Britain's attitude towards Italy is becoming tougher again, while France's attitude towards Italy has changed again. (National Telegraph, August 8)</p>
<p>(London) According to well-informed sources who spoke to our correspondent, when the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council meets in Geneva tomorrow, Foreign Secretary Eden will raise two demands: 1. An immediate investigation into the Italian army's methods of warfare in Abyssinia. 2. The Thirteen-Nation Committee should draft a basis for a peace plan so that a ceasefire can be achieved after the two warring countries accept the principles. However, if the committee's deliberations are unsuccessful, the League of Nations General Assembly's Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee should be convened immediately to tighten sanctions against Italy. The British government's intentions in making these demands are twofold: 1. To make Italy understand that delaying the matter is of no benefit to it. 2. To find ways to offset the advantages Italy has gained through military victories. It is generally known that the British government originally intended to demand the immediate convening of the Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee, but fearing that this move might force Italy to embrace Germany and conclude a military alliance with it, it abandoned its original plan. Political figures are generally pessimistic about the resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, believing that if the peace efforts of the Thirteen-Nation Committee fail, Italy will inevitably choose between Germany and France.

<p>(Brussels) Prime Minister Janson is scheduled to take the train at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, passing through Paris, to Geneva. If the debate time in the House of Representatives on that day is longer than expected, he may depart after 4:00 p.m. It is not certain, but in any case, he should arrive in Geneva on the morning of Friday (the 10th) to attend the Locarno Two Resolution Conference.

<h3>Italian Prime Minister Convenes Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Reports on the Latest War Situation in East Africa and Approves the Air Force Conscription System</p>
<p>(Rome) The Cabinet was originally scheduled to meet on Saturday, but Prime Minister Mussolini suddenly convened it today. Mussolini described the great victory of the Italian army in Abyssinia, stating that the Battle of Lake Ashangi brought the Italian army closer to achieving its goal, which is the security of the Italian colonies. The Italian army's decision to resort to force was for this purpose. Mussolini also praised the strategy of General Badoglio, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army. (Reuters dispatch, August 8)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Council of State held a meeting today and immediately approved the Air Force conscription system. After the meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that Prime Minister Mussolini had made a declaration saying, "The Abyssinian army is about to be annihilated, and all Italian territories have therefore obtained sufficient security guarantees. Regarding the issue of peace negotiations between Italy and Abyssinia, although Italy has accepted the request of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Council and sent personnel to attend, the current number of Italian troops in East Africa will not be reduced as a result. The preparations of the headquarters of the army, navy, and air force will continue and be accelerated." (Havas dispatch, August 8)</p>
<p>The Thirteen-Nation Committee Meets - Abyssinia Issues Final Appeal to the League of Nations</p>
<p>Weakness Subjected to Aggression Endangers World Peace - Urgently Hopes for Effective Prevention</p>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinian Foreign Minister Heruy has sent a telegram to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, issuing a final appeal to the League of Nations in the name of the Abyssinian government, stating, "The obligations stipulated in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant are clearly stated, but the Italian government is still able to wage war against a weak and helpless nation with impunity. As for the methods of warfare used by the Italian army, which include bombing defenseless cities from the air and even using poisonous gas, they are truly brutal. At this moment, all the weak countries in the world believe that although the League of Nations Covenant has provisions for a collective security system, it is doubtful whether it can be relied upon, as the impact of the Italian-Abyssinian war has threatened all these small countries. "The invasion of Abyssinia by Italy puts world peace in danger, and the Abyssinian nation will be destroyed. It is hoped that the League of Nations will no longer stand idly by, but will quickly provide effective assistance to the invaded country, because the issue concerns not only the independence of Abyssinia." (Havas dispatch, August 7)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Government Issues General Mobilization Order</h3>
<p>All Men in the Country Should Enlist - Italian Troops Take Advantage of Victory to Advance into Taysi</p>
<p>(London) According to a spokesman for the Abyssinian Embassy in Britain, the Abyssinian government has issued a general mobilization order, and all physically fit men in the country should enlist. In the future, the number of Abyssinian troops can be doubled compared to the current number. (Havas dispatch, August 7)</p>
<p>(Abyssinian Capital) This afternoon, the Abyssinian King's order to enlist all those who are able to serve in the military was read out in the palace. At the same time, observers on the northern front are asking each other, "Where is the Abyssinian King?" The Abyssinian King, fearing that he would be targeted by Italian bombers, abandoned his car and headed south on foot. His car has been captured by the Italian army. The Crown Prince is now leading 2,000 people north from Taysi to find and protect his father. It is reported that the armed bandits are killing Abyssinian King's defeated soldiers, which is quite cruel. The corpses are piled up along the way south of Guran, and the advancing Italian army must clear the roads with burial teams before they can move. The Crown Prince is afraid that his father will be in danger, so he has to go to protect him. The Italian army is currently advancing in two routes south of Guran, one along the "Imperial Road" to spy on Taysi, and the other towards Magdala. The Italian army now claims that the area of Abyssinian land that has fallen into the hands of the Italian army is as large as half of Britain. (Reuters dispatch, August 7)</p>
<p>(Rome) After occupying Guran, the Italian army on the northern front in East Africa, in addition to a part of the first column, is continuing to advance south to pursue the Abyssinian army. The rest of the troops are working hard to reorganize and clear the rear. A large number of workers have begun to rush to build the highway to Guran, so that the Italian army's tank and armored vehicle fleets can approach Taysi and threaten the Abyssinian army. According to the Italian military authorities, the date of launching the general offensive on Taysi is not far away. The Italian air force has been flying to Taysi to scout and bomb for days, which has been enough to make the remaining members of the Abyssinian Imperial Guard feel uneasy.

<h3>Unexpected Secondary Declaration - Respect for Egyptian Interests - Prepared to Conclude an Agreement - Maintaining the Status Quo of the Boundary</h3>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Stefani news agency recently published a statement made by Foreign Minister Suvich to the Egyptian Chargé d'Affaires, stating, "The claim that Italy intends to attack or threaten Egypt in some way is absurd. Italy has no intention of conquering Egypt as an Italian colony, and this is true now and will be true in the future. Egypt and Italian Libya in North Africa are adjacent, and there should be no concerns about the common boundary there. Italy is now prepared to conclude an agreement with Egypt to guarantee the continuation of this boundary, maintain the status quo, and ensure that Italy's policy towards Egypt is based purely on a spirit of friendship."

<h3>Strait of Tartary - Turkey Prepares to Restore Armaments</h3>
<p>If Success Cannot Be Achieved Through Negotiations, the Treaty of Lausanne Will Automatically Be Declared Void</p>
<p>(Istanbul) According to news from Ankara, the Turkish capital, if the Turkish government cannot abolish the provisions in the Treaty of Lausanne regarding the demilitarization of the straits through negotiations, it may abolish it itself. It is reported that responsible parties in the country all believe that the rearmament of the Strait of Tartary is a matter of the utmost importance for Turkey's existence, as the general security situation in Europe has recently changed greatly, and both Germany and Austria have abolished the military clauses in the peace treaty. Although Turkey is keen to respect its commitments, it must do its utmost to achieve amendments regarding the fortification of the straits and Gallipoli. According to the Treaty of Lausanne, which was concluded in 1923, formally ended the state of war between Turkey and the Allied Powers, ceding East Thrace (including Adrianople) to Turkey, while Turkey abandoned its Palestinian and Iraqi territories to British trusteeship, abandoned Syria to French trusteeship, and abandoned the rest of Arabia. The most important clause in the treaty was the one regarding the straits. This clause guaranteed the freedom of the straits, and another special convention stipulated the demilitarization of the area on both sides of the Bosphorus Strait and the Sea of Marmara, and stipulated regulations to guarantee the freedom of the straits in times of peace and war, with a mixed commission sent by the League of Nations to monitor its implementation.

<h3>Spain President Forced to Resign</h3>
<p>Due to illegal dissolution of Congress, Bariot was elected provisional president</p>
<p>Madrid: The "People's Front" (i.e., the left-wing Socialist Party, the Communist Party, and the Industrial Revolution Party) was indignant at President Zamora's interference in the work of Congress, and excited by its victory in the recent general election, and therefore proposed a motion to impeach the president, saying that Mr. Chai's dissolution of the Second Congress on January 7 was detrimental to the interests of the country. This motion was passed by a vote of 238 to 5, with both the left and right parties supporting it, and then the Speaker of the National Assembly, Bariot, the leader of the Radical Democratic Party, was elected provisional president. According to Mr. Chai's downfall, his end was revealed in January. At that time, the far-right parties and the "People's Front" opposed the cabinet formed by the former Liberal Party leader Valadares on December 14 and December 30. The first cabinet resigned eight hours after December 30 due to a dispute over the joint right-wing and central parties resisting the left wing in the general election. Mr. Valadares then formed a new government with a non-partisan faction. The new government decided not to hold a congressional meeting immediately and adjourned the meeting until January 31, so except for the non-partisan factions, they all opposed it, pointing out that it was close to arbitrary tactics, and tried to force Mr. Chai to convene Congress, and on the one hand, they planned to impeach Mr. Fa and his cabinet members. When the far-right parties were about to present the signatures of sufficient numbers of members to Congress, Mr. Fa took the lead and, with the permission of the president, ordered the dissolution of Congress. However, Mr. Fa's cabinet resigned on February 19 as a result of the "People's Front" winning a great victory in the general election, and the new government was formed by former Prime Minister Azaña to replace it.

<h3>Moscow Newspaper Comments on the Mutual Assistance Agreement Between Mongolia and Russia</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The editorial of "Izvestia" stated that the draft mutual assistance signed in Kulun on March 12 is a clear example of unwavering efforts to strive for peace, and also an example of the Soviet Union's assistance to peaceful and friendly people on the basis of complete equality and mutual benefit, and their heroic struggle for their rights to survival and independence.</p>
<p>The people of the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic have been linked by close and unremitting friendship for fifteen years. This friendship arose in 1921 when they jointly resisted foreign enemies. At that time, the Soviet government accepted the request of the Mongolian People's Republic and sent the Red Army to Outer Mongolia to unite with the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Army to defeat the mercenary looting teams of Japanese interventionists. They wanted to enslave the Mongolian people and turn Outer Mongolia into a colony of Japan and a base for Japanese imperialism to continue to attack the Soviet Union. In this common victorious struggle, the mutual assistance agreement between the Soviet government and the government of the Mongolian People's Republic was born and realized, that is, in the future, when one of the contracting countries is threatened by a third party's military attack, it will still be effective. At the request of the government of Outer Mongolia, the Soviet government agreed to temporarily station a part of its troops in the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic in the same year until the danger of attack on the Mongolian People's Republic is eliminated. When the situation in the Far East made it unnecessary for Soviet troops to be stationed in Outer Mongolia, the Soviet government, with the consent of the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, withdrew all its troops from Outer Mongolia in early 1925.</p>
<p>When we reviewed the memorandum of the government of the Mongolian People's Republic on February 27, 1925, we thanked the Soviet government for its assistance to the Mongolian people as follows: "The government, on behalf of all the people of the Mongolian People's Republic, expresses its deep satisfaction and gratitude for the indelible friendship of the Red Army to the people of the Mongolian People's Republic. Please convey the deep gratitude of the Mongolian people to the workers and peasants of the Soviet Union and the heroic Red Army, the permanent protectors of the oppressed and enslaved people of the world, and the leading organs of your country.</p>
<p>The working people of the Mongolian People's Republic and its government all believe that the two countries will continue their sincere friendship and mutual assistance in times of common adversity in the future. Our people and government dare to believe deeply that if the situation of 1921 is ever seen again—which is not what we want—the Soviet Union and its Red Army will definitely provide assistance."</p>
<p>From this, we can see that even at the time of the signing of the Beijing Treaty in 1925, the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia still maintained their deep friendship and mutual assistance relationship. This relationship was established in 1921 and is completely in line with the interests of China.</p>
<p>The great revolution of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who devoted his life to the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people, fully confirmed that Soviet assistance was absolutely necessary to ensure the sanctity and integrity of Outer Mongolia and prevent it from becoming a base for attacking the Soviet Union and China. In the joint communiqué between Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the Soviet representative to China in January 1923, he pointed out that "the immediate withdrawal of Russian troops from Outer Mongolia is neither urgent nor in the real welfare of China. It will be due to the current Beijing government's inability to guarantee that after the withdrawal of Russian troops, the anti-Russian White Army will no longer carry out its conspiracies and create a more serious situation than it is now."</p>
<p>Soviet Union's guaranteeing the security of Outer Mongolia's border is not only a primary task for Soviet security, but also for China, and the Chinese government has the responsibility not to allow Outer Mongolia to become a base for attacking the Soviet Union, which was recorded in the Beijing Treaty. Article 5 of the treaty stated that the Soviet government recognizes Outer Mongolia as a component part of the Republic of China and respects China's sovereignty in the area. At the same time, the article stipulates that the Soviet Union's withdrawal of its troops from Outer Mongolia shall be carried out "the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Outer Mongolia and the meeting to discuss the date of withdrawal of troops and the means of ensuring border security shall be agreed upon."</p>
<p>This article has clearly indicated that the Chinese government has also recognized that the Soviet Union has the right to adopt various methods at a certain time, such as sending troops to the Mongolian People's Republic, to guarantee its border security. The method of withdrawing troops should have been discussed and agreed upon at the Sino-Soviet meeting according to the Beijing Agreement, which is very clear. However, this meeting has not been convened, which is not the fault of the Soviet Union but has been prevented by China's civil war and the instability of the Chinese government. However, the Soviet government, without waiting for the convening of the Sino-Soviet meeting, took the initiative and, with the consent of the government of the Mongolian People's Republic, immediately withdrew its troops when it was no longer necessary to station troops in the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic. At the same time, the Soviet government still has the obligation to assist the Mongolian people in maintaining the integrity and dignity of their territory, as well as economic and cultural construction. Therefore, in 1934, when the Mongolian People's Republic was again threatened by territorial invasion, the Premier of the Cabinet of the Mongolian People's Republic, Mr. Genden, proposed to the Soviet government that it request assistance when the Mongolian People's Republic was attacked. The two countries reiterated their obligation to provide each other with various mutual assistance—including military assistance—when they were attacked by a third country, which is only natural. This agreement was not formally signed, but was a verbal understanding, that is, the so-called gentleman's agreement.</p>
<p>When the Japanese-Manchu troops began to repeatedly attack the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic in 1935, the Soviet government repeatedly asked the Japanese government to pay attention to its deep concern for maintaining the dignity of Outer Mongolia. In fact, when the Japanese-Manchu army attempted to seize the territory of Outer Mongolia, it was difficult for the Soviet Union to stand by and watch. However, regardless of these stern repeated warnings, the attacks by the Japanese-Manchu army on the territory of the Mongolian People's Republic not only continued, but also took on a more provocative and bold nature. Therefore, in January 1935, the government of the Mongolian People's Republic believed that it was necessary to send a delegation to Moscow to formally revise the original verbal agreement into a public agreement on mutual assistance, allowing the Mongolian People's Republic to be given assistance. On January 25 this year, the Presidium of the "Small Khural" and the Cabinet meeting of the Mongolian People's Republic again requested assistance from the Soviet Union, and made a special written application, which was delivered to Kalinin and Molotov, and signed by the chairman of the "Small Khural", Mr. Amur, and the Premier of the Cabinet, Mr. Genden.</p>
<p>The Soviet government agreed to the request of the government of the Mongolian People's Republic and signed the draft agreement in Kulun on March 12, 1936, which more clearly stipulated the specific mutual assistance obligations. This obligation was established as early as 1921 on the basis of jointly resisting intervention. This agreement is also fully in line with the Beijing Agreement of 1924. The most unreasonable adventurers among the Japanese warlords are now trying to seize Outer Mongolia again. Obviously, the Soviet government's actions are fully in line with its various obligations to the Mongolian People's Republic and are for the maintenance of peace. This self-defense action will not infringe on the interests of the Chinese people in the slightest.</p>
<p>In the meeting between Howard and the leader of the Soviet people, Stalin, Mr. Shi declared in a frank and clear manner, "If Japan dares to attack the Mongolian People's Republic and attempts to infringe on its independence, then we have to assist the Mongolian People's Republic, just as we did in 1921." This statement has caused enthusiasm in the Soviet Union and the Mongolian People's Republic, and has received the greatest sympathy and understanding from all peace-loving friends in the world. The broad masses of the Chinese people have also seen from this statement the firm expression of the Soviet government's efforts to strive for peace, and know that the Soviet government's position is also in line with China's interests, because China is tired of resisting aggression and has no ability to guarantee the territorial security of the Mongolian People's Republic.</p>
<p>The March 12, 1936, draft agreement is a peaceful document, that is, even the worst enemy of the Soviet Union cannot obtain a word in the agreement except for warning those who invade the territory of other countries and that the Soviet Union is prepared to provide assistance when the Mongolian people become victims of aggression. The peace-loving Mongolian people have no plans for aggression or imperialism against their neighbors, and peace in the Far East is completely dependent on the neighbors, which is self-evident.

<h3>Japanese Illegally Renting Land in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Philippine Authorities Consider Solutions</p>
<p>(Manila) According to news from Davao, Mindanao, the Philippine Minister of Agriculture and Commerce is now planning to solve the problem of Japanese people cultivating and renting land in Davao, causing some people to threaten to harm his life. The minister went to Davao yesterday with the ministers of Internal Affairs and Justice to discuss with President Quezon how to solve this matter. Official circles are currently discussing three solutions: 1. The government buys all the land owned by the Japanese; 2. Expels the Japanese; 3. Allows the Japanese a period of grace to end their business in Davao, and then recovers the land. It is estimated that the Japanese investment in Davao is worth 30 million pesos. According to public speculation, the third solution is the most likely to be implemented. The authorities will allow the Japanese to cultivate their land until the lease expires, and then take over it and dispose of its property. Before the lease expires, the government may collect a portion of the income from the land. (Reuters Telegram on the 8th)</p>

<h3>Hunan's New Cultural Movement: Promoting Innovation from the Foundation of Traditional Culture, Diligently Constructing Scientific Enterprises</h3>
<p>Beijing Dispatch: Mr. Li Huarui, advisor to the Hunan Provincial Government and the First Route Army Headquarters for Bandit Suppression, recently made remarks in Beijing regarding Hunan's internal affairs, which aroused considerable interest from various parties. As Mr. Liu is about to return to Hunan, our reporter specially interviewed him again. Reporter: There are rumors that a "New Chinese Cultural Movement" will be launched in Hunan. Is this true? Mr. Liu: Launching a New Chinese Cultural Movement is Mr. He's sole objective in presiding over both military and civilian affairs in Hunan Province. Furthermore, this movement has already begun. If it continues for five to ten years, there will certainly be significant results. Reporter: Could you please provide examples of the New Chinese Cultural Movement projects? Mr. Liu: Hunan has achieved remarkable results in training in national martial arts. From elementary school, middle school, and university students to all counties and villages in the province, people are engaged in learning. We also promote traditional Chinese medicine, implement inherent moral education, advocate the study of classics, and operate various industrial and commercial enterprises. Reporter: Some people consider the items you mentioned as a step backward. How can they be considered a New Cultural Movement? Mr. Liu: There is a misunderstanding among the general public in China regarding this New Cultural Movement. It is considered a suicidal movement. Instead, it advocates negating the treasures of China's inherent civilization, the legacy of sages and scholars from the past five thousand years, deeming them worthless. This is a completely wrong path. For example, the scientific and civilized achievements of countries like England and the United States today did not come about by overthrowing all of England's old culture. When we examine the history of major industrial and civilized countries in the world, we find that their reformers and scientists all sought new discoveries based on the legacy of their ancestors. It certainly didn't arise from the English people refusing to speak English, write English characters, or read English books. The same is true for other countries. In the future, to generate genuinely new Chinese cultural enterprises, we must, on a large scale and thoroughly, promote innovation from the existing foundation. Reporter: Is there a concrete publicity plan for this movement? Mr. Liu: These kinds of enterprises require dedicated hard work and the cooperation of the entire nation. In the past, there was too much empty talk and superficial publicity. In the future, we must be faithful and exert our efforts. Reporter: What is the outline for this dedicated hard work? Mr. Liu: He Jian's governance, both politically and militarily, has culture as its objective. That is, both politics and military affairs should be directed by culture. Officials should not harm the people, and soldiers should not disturb the people. Everyone should engage in cultural construction for the country and their locality, using the power of politics and the military to develop and protect the dignity of five thousand years of national culture, and to cooperate with the world's new civilization. Reporter: According to you, Hunan is very energetic. However, there are still outsiders who speak ill of Hunan, and some publications even criticize Chairman He. Mr. Liu: It's hard to avoid praise and criticism. Even Confucius, George Washington, and Napoleon are still being criticized in books and articles. In short, He Jian and the future of Hunan will be evident to both domestic and international observers through facts. Reporter: What about Hunan's scientific enterprises? Mr. Liu: Hunan's cultural politics, industry, and commerce all possess a scientific spirit. The provincial government publishes the Hunan Yearbook, which provides a clear overview. The province has established an Industrial Experiment Institute, an Agricultural Experiment Institute, a Geological Survey Institute, a Social and Economic Survey Institute, and a Mineral Testing Institute. All of these have systematic scientific publications and remarkable achievements. They are all being carried out using scientific methods.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent of This Newspaper: Cheng Jun)</p>
<p>(4) Bandit Troubles and Local Conditions in Chongyang</p>
<p>The county has the Juan River, which was likely called Xiajuan in ancient times, hence the name. The river originates in Tongcheng County, traverses the county, flows down to Puji and connects to Hankou. It is the most beneficial river for the county, irrigating the fields on both sides, allowing for three harvests each year, without fear of flooding. In other areas, people value weirs more than ponds. The largest weirs are Huabei and Shizui. Because the four borders are mostly mountainous, there is no fear of water scarcity. The main agricultural products are rice, wheat, beans, potatoes, buckwheat, and five types of grains. In addition, tea, paper, and tung oil are also major products. However, the people are exceptionally lazy, especially the men. The cultivation of the fields mostly relies on women. The men are mostly idle, not only not diligently farming but also wasteful in their consumption, addicted to smoking and gambling. From Zhao Liqiao to Zongshi, the reporter traveled seventy li, and saw no more than one or two dozen farmers in the fields. The fields left uncultivated were no less than seven or eight out of ten. Initially, I thought it was not yet farming season or affected by the Red Bandits. Unexpectedly, the laziness was so extreme. On the 23rd, investigations near the county seat revealed that many farmers were as thin as firewood, all due to opium addiction. Therefore, even though the land is fertile, the farmers are still extremely poor. In good years, they have no savings, and in bad years, they inevitably face death. Among the entire county, the first and fourth districts are blessed by nature, and the people's nature is also unique. The second district is next. The third and fifth districts are the worst, but the farmers are relatively diligent. It can be seen that the blessings Heaven bestows upon the people of Chongyang are actually harming them. Last year, the third district suffered a severe drought. Chief Commander Chen Jicheng requested and obtained 11,000 yuan in disaster relief funds, which County Magistrate Gong Nan used to purchase grain, personally going to the villages to distribute it, saving many lives. Soon after, the price of tung oil increased tenfold. People collected tung oil in the mountains, each earning dozens of dan, reaping great profits. The tea, tung, bamboo, and other products of the mountains do not require human labor or fertilizer, naturally forming forests. The people of Chongyang only need to enjoy their benefits. The tea is black tea, traditionally sold to Russia. Now, very few Russians come to buy it, greatly affecting people's livelihoods. Bamboo can be made into paper, but people adhere to old methods and have not been able to improve it, so sales are not very smooth. In the entire county, owner-farmers and tenant-farmers each account for half. In the past, there were quite a few large landlords, but they have all moved elsewhere to avoid bandits. Hired farmers are divided into long-term laborers and short-term laborers. Long-term laborers are paid by the month, with wages of three yuan. Short-term laborers are paid by the day, with wages of one jiao five fen to two jiao. Those who provide their own food receive three jiao to four jiao.</p>
<p>As for the people's burden, in the past, taxes were divided into four types: land tax, rice tax, stored military rice tax, and eliminated military rice tax. Land tax was one yuan four jiao for every tael of silver for the basic tax, one jiao eight fen seven li for the provincial surtax, six yuan two jiao for local defense donation, five jiao six fen for county administration donation, and three jiao seven fen four li for education donation. Rice tax was two yuan eight jiao for the basic tax per dan, one yuan one jiao two fen for county administration donation, and two jiao six fen two li for education donation. Stored military rice tax was one yuan four jiao nine fen four li for the basic tax per dan, and three yuan six jiao for the local defense donation. Eliminated military rice tax was one yuan three jiao seven li for the basic tax per dan, and three yuan six jiao for the local defense donation. Stored military rice tax and eliminated military rice tax were special taxes left over from the Qing Dynasty. Last winter, the dan-tael system was abolished and replaced with the mu (acre) system for collecting national currency. The total area in the county is 250,015 mu, with a basic tax of one jiao four fen per mu, a mu donation of two jiao eight fen, an additional five fen for county administration donation, and two fen for education donation. Each year, it is collected in two installments, during the spring and autumn harvests. The people complain that the mu donation is too heavy and they cannot afford it. Regarding excessive and miscellaneous taxes, before the 20th year of the Republic [1931], the Baiyuntan Township in the county had a production tax collection office, collecting taxes on rice, grain, leather, oil, firecrackers, and paper. With the representation of fellow villagers in the provincial capital, such as Pang Buqi, it was approved for abolition. Although a few taxes remain, they are close to being excessive and miscellaneous, but they are collected voluntarily by the people to support schools, so generally there is no significant problem. Other things, such as rural loans, do not involve usurious exploitation. Cooperative enterprises are also being actively promoted. There are a total of sixty-four rural preparatory cooperative societies, providing 30,000 yuan in production funds. The loans released in the first year were fully and voluntarily repaid in the next quarter. The people's credit is also highly admirable.</p>
<p>Regarding education and transportation, I can also briefly describe the general situation. The county has two county-established elementary schools, with 285 students; twelve county-established junior elementary schools, with 367 students; seven district-established elementary schools, with 89 students; five people's schools, with 135 students; seven short-term schools, with 312 students; one private elementary school, with 95 students; twenty-one joint security elementary schools, with 836 students. The number of literate people is 33,390. Regarding transportation, the Yangchong Line and Chongtong Line of the Seven Provinces Highway have already been opened to traffic, and the Chongping Line is still under construction.</p>
<p>The prohibition of opium in Chongyang is a particularly serious issue that must be specially described. Because the people are especially addicted to opium, and the opium is easily transported from Hunan, just taking the corner of the county seat as an example, it is said that there are no fewer than 200 opium dens, large and small. Dasha Ping and Baini Bridge each have more than a dozen. Many young people are also addicted. The county magistrate has strictly prohibited it, sealing up a definite number of opium dens. Currently, there are still 57 dens. In such a small area, there are so many dens, which is shocking. After asking around, no one is willing to say why so many opium dens can be tolerated, or perhaps they have concerns.</p>
<p>Although the people there are mostly lazy and fond of smoking and gambling, their nature is pure and kind, without the tendency to cheat or defraud, which is their virtue. Moreover, they are all unwilling to join the bandits, and they are quite respectful to the county government and the stationed troops. If, after the bandits are suppressed, they diligently cultivate the land, eliminate their addictions, utilize natural products, and improve their manufacturing, the revival of the countryside can be expected.

<h3>Northern Anhui: Promoting Model Irrigation, the Fangqiu Lake Experiment Achieves Success, and the Mingyue Lake Development is Completed</h3>
<p>Bengbu Dispatch: Production and construction are the most pressing needs of today, and agricultural experiments are especially imperative. In recent years, the Construction Committee has attached great importance to production enterprises. First, the Model Irrigation General Administration was established in Nanjing to investigate the official wasteland lakes in the country and apply scientific methods to gradually reclaim and plant them, in order to increase production. Wujin and Wujiang in Jiangsu have already achieved considerable success. In northern Anhui, there are many lakes, making it particularly suitable for implementing model irrigation. Since the Fangqiu Lake west of Linhuai was gradually developed by the Fenghuai District Irrigation Experiment Farm two years ago, it has been nearly two years. The lake area is estimated to be over 8,000 mu, and a considerable number of fertile fields have been exposed, which have been gradually cultivated, and production is quite considerable. In order to develop irrigation enterprises, Zhou Chengshu, director of the Linbu Experiment Farm, re-surveyed Mingyue Lake, located about three li southeast of Juli. He immediately started to dig ditches, build embankments, drain water, and install gates for various works. The embankment is about five li long, and there are eight gates. In general, whenever there is a mountain torrent outbreak in the summer and autumn seasons, floods surge south of Fengyang and enter the Huai River from here. The installation of gates can drain the water when opened, so as not to harm agricultural affairs, and it can also store water when closed, so as to irrigate the fields. The above-mentioned construction projects cost more than 10,000 yuan. Now all the works have been completed, and it is planned to carry out experimental reclamation and planting this year. Once it has been successful, it will be invited to be adopted. Reclamation, cultivation, and harvesting will all use new methods, in order to achieve excellent agricultural products, abundant harvests, and increased production benefits. (April 6)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Village Head Arrested for Digging Up Graves</h3>
<p>Demolishing tombs and digging up enclosures has been happening from time to time in various districts recently. Previously, Liao Zhaoshun, the town head of Tongbo Town in the first district, submitted a request to prohibit it, and the county government issued a notice to prohibit it. However, recently, villagers Zhong Shiliang and Xu Xingsheng in Xidongjing Township in the second district each had ancestral tombs in Jiangjia Bang in the township. The other day, Zhong Shiliang's nephew, Changsheng, caught sight of someone digging at the tomb and returned to inform his uncle. He immediately reported to the fifth branch station for investigation. It turned out that the village head of the fifth bao in the township, Xu Shiying, had hired Jiangbei people to dig up the tomb. Xu, along with the workers Xie Lijin, Xu Yousan, and others, were brought to the Public Security Bureau for preliminary interrogation. According to Village Head Xu's confession, he hired workers to dig up the tomb because he knew that the tomb was ownerless and planned to use the bricks and stones to repair bridges and roads. However, Zhong and others stated that it was indeed an ancestral tomb and that they had grain documents to prove it. Director He transferred the case to the local court for trial because it was related to the judiciary.</p>

Yesterday (the 8th), Yang Nai and others again presented a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters, stating that Yu Jiuru and others, the executive directors of the Fishermen's Association, had been sentenced to three months in prison by the local court. Sun Danzhen, in order to make up for his own mistakes, published a notice in the newspaper to return the money defrauded from the fishermen in order to shirk his responsibility, which further proves Sun Danzhen's perversion of the law and pursuit of private interests. Moreover, recently he suddenly went to the province or elsewhere, and has no time to take care of his work, which is indeed a neglect of duty. Therefore, they submitted further evidence and requested that he be punished quickly to uphold justice and maintain party discipline.</p>

It happened to be a thunderstorm, and the female workers, mostly around 20 years old, were competing for umbrellas to shelter from the rain in the boat. At that time, the tide was surging and rapid, causing the boat to sway and become unstable, and it capsized. All the people fell into the water. After the factory learned the news, they ordered workers to find and retrieve them. As a result, 13 people were rescued, most of whom were barely breathing.

Because the village office had no funds, it collected more than 400 silver dollars and five dou of white rice from nearby households and distributed them to the refugees, who supported the old and carried the young and went to Yifeng. On the afternoon of the 6th, more than 500 refugees also arrived in Houdu. Fortunately, local gentry raised six silver dollars and five dou of rice, ordering them to go to Anchang.</p>

<h3>Foreign Directors of the Municipal Council: Talk of No Re-election</h3>
<p>The foreign press translated from the French newspaper: According to news last night, the re-election of the foreign directors of the Municipal Council, originally scheduled for April 20th and 21st, has not seen enthusiastic participation from those willing to serve as candidates. As of last night, only five British, two American, and one Japanese national had volunteered to be candidates. This Japanese national is Haba, also a former director. It is heard that another director vacancy will be filled by a Japanese national named Yamamoto, who is expected to register today, as the registration deadline is noon tomorrow. If this is the case, there will be nine foreign directors on the Municipal Council, and only nine candidates. Since the number of candidates matches the number of seats to be filled, there is no need to hold an election. It is expected that the Consular Body will announce the nominated individuals as the elected directors.</p>
<h3>Increase in Shanghai Goods Exported to the United States</h3>

However, tea decreased from US$152,948 to US$31,509, and sesame also decreased from US$1,419,805 to US$1,054,712. The increase in exports to the Philippines was mainly in cotton goods.</p>
<h3>American Plans to Extend Loans to China</h3>
<p>Recommendations from Ferrand and Fox</p>
<p>The Continental News reported that Mr. Ferrand, former president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai and vice president of the Sin-American Company, recently returned to the United States and had detailed discussions with various economic experts. According to the Chamber's monthly publication, Mr. Ferrand stated that the United States has a plan to immediately subsidize American trade with China. American manufacturers are currently planning to form a consortium with a debt of US$150 million to provide long-term loans for various practical industrial projects in China on a revolving basis, guaranteed by foreign-style banking organizations. In addition, Mr. Fox, the director of the recent American Economic Survey Mission to China, is currently planning to organize a company to take over the various debts owed by the Chinese government to Americans. It is heard that Mr. Fox has obtained a tentative promise that if he can organize a company to settle these debts, the Chinese government will be able to repay US$6 million annually, but the payments must be used to purchase American goods. Mr. Ferrand also stated that American exports to various countries have decreased from $5 billion to $1.6 billion annually, so manufacturers are eager to find ways to remedy this, and the U.S. government has also extended loans to the Export-Import Bank, believing that this will enable American exporters to compete with foreign countries in export trade.</p>
<h3>Tricolor Wheel Fire Extinguished: Ship Intact, Cargo in Five Holds Destroyed</h3>
<p>Reuters, San Francisco, 8th: According to a recent telegram, the fire on the Norwegian motor vessel Tricolor has been extinguished, so the lives of the crew should be safe. The ship encountered an accident on its way from Manila to California. Last night's telegrams stated that the fifth hold was still burning and requested assistance from nearby ships. Today's telegram states that although the fire has been extinguished, it does not mention whether assistance is still needed.</p>
<p>Tianjin Goods Completely Destroyed</p>
<p>The reporter of this newspaper continued to report the following based on the investigation yesterday: The goods loaded on the Tricolor from the ports of Tianjin and Shanghai were all in the fifth hold. Tianjin goods were in the lower hold, and Shanghai goods were in the upper hold. The fire broke out in the fifth hold. Fortunately, the 700 tons of tung oil from Shanghai were not loaded, otherwise the entire ship would have been unimaginable. It is now known that after two days and nights of burning, all the goods shipped to the United States from Shanghai and Tianjin have been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Ship Preserved</p>
<p>Shanghai Tianxiang Foreign Firm sent many telegrams to inquire about the whereabouts of the ship, but never received a direct reply from the ship. Later, they telegraphed the Hong Kong firm to inquire nearby. Finally, they received confirmation that the remaining fire in the fifth hold had gradually been extinguished by the efforts of the entire crew. Although the fourth and sixth holds were not affected by the fire, the goods may have suffered water damage. Fortunately, the hull of the ship has been preserved. It is planned to instruct the shipowner to try to sail to Yokohama for major repairs in the dock. If it is not possible to go to Japan, then change to Honolulu. Telegrams have been sent to notify.</p>
<p>Ship's History</p>
<p>The original Tricolor was pledged by the British government last year. Later, due to an accident en route, the entire ship was destroyed. The British government and the insurance company paid out compensation, and the William Babur Shipping Company used this compensation to build a new ship, which was still named Tricolor, but the carrying capacity had been expanded to 11,000 tons, and the steel plate hull was very good. It had only been in operation for five months when it caught fire. This ship was originally managed by Shunheng Foreign Firm in this port, but it was temporarily replaced by Tianxiang due to the decision to take over the Taiyin route.</p>
<h3>Foreign Directors Election of the Public Concession: Thorough Investigation of Vote Counting Errors Shows the Cause Was a Simple Oversight; Relevant Personnel Were Not Intentionally Negligent</h3>
<p>Regarding the vote counting error that occurred during the recent election of foreign directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council, the Council appointed the current directors of the Council, Caneke Kelleri and Yamamoto Takeo, etc. as a three-person investigative committee to thoroughly investigate the incident of the error occurring. Since the committee started its investigation on the 30th of last month, it has now reported the incident. Here is a summary of its report to the Board of Directors:</p>
<p>The original text is very long, totaling fourteen pages. The following is a summary of its conclusions: "Based on the findings of this committee's investigation, the responsibility for the omission of the failure to fully count the votes should be shared by the two vote counters, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, and the Deputy Director of the Finance Department (Head of the Revenue Department)." In order to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future, the committee also proposed that the new Board of Directors this year should instruct the personnel of the Municipal Council to formulate new regulations within the scope of the Land Regulations, stipulating the procedures for elections and vote counting, and the responsibilities and tasks of each office worker. In addition, the committee also proposed that the term "Election Reporter" for the Director-General of the Municipal Council, as stated in the current "Service Regulations" of the Municipal Council, is only mentioned in the resolution of the 1925 Taxpayer Annual Meeting, and is not stipulated by the Land Regulations, and is very different from the duties and status of the so-called "Election Reporter" in the United Kingdom, so it is proposed to delete the term. Furthermore, there are many unclear boundaries between the duties and responsibilities of senior officials of the Municipal Council inquired during the investigation. Although this section is not within the scope of the investigation of this election matter, it is essential. Therefore, it is also proposed to ask the new Board of Directors to form another committee to investigate and define the responsibilities and tasks of senior officials of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Scope of Investigation: The scope of the task of this investigation committee can be roughly divided into the following three items: Investigate the cause of the omission in vote counting in this election of foreign directors; Ascertain the responsibilities of the relevant personnel; and Propose how to improve the election mechanism in the future. Based on the above scope, the committee began its investigation work. The personnel consulted included the two vote counters, Wilson and Borson; the personnel of the Municipal Council included Director-General Zhong Si, Deputy Director of the Finance Department (Head of the Revenue Department) Born, Accountant of the Finance Department Mitton, Senior Assistant Kao Maolan, Japanese Assistant Chief Ishuku Hidenen, Assistant of the Director-General's Office Pissley, and Assistant of the Finance Department Klein. The above persons were all present during the vote counting, and Zhong Si was present at the beginning of the vote counting, at the end of the vote counting, and at intervals in between.</p>
<p>Cause of Error: According to the report of the Investigation Committee, "After hearing all the testimonies, the committee firmly believes that the error in the count of this vote was entirely due to negligence. All the evidence obtained does not raise the slightest suspicion of misconduct on the part of each relevant person. However, since the error has occurred, the lack of command in the deliberation hall, the place where the votes are counted, is indeed undeniable." The report further stated, "This lack of command is due to the fact that the responsibilities and tasks of each person present were not clearly defined."</p>
<p>Analysis of Responsibilities: According to the provisions of the Land Regulations, the responsibility for handling the election should be borne by the two vote counters. However, according to the committee's investigation, the vote counters did not understand their responsibilities and tasks beforehand. They claimed that they did not check whether the two ballot boxes were completely empty when counting the votes. They dare not escape their responsibility for this. However, there were so many senior officials of the Municipal Council present at the same time, so they all thought that others must have paid attention to this matter. According to many years of established practice, the vote counters' assumption seems to be reasonable. But on the other hand, since the vote counters have received the responsibility, how can they never study the tasks stipulated by the Land Regulations? Therefore, the investigation committee deeply felt that "these two vote counters, technically speaking, should bear the responsibility for the error. However, under the circumstances at the time, the Director-General of the Municipal Council and the Head of the Revenue Department cannot shirk their responsibilities." As for the responsibility of the Head of the Revenue Department, according to his own understanding, it originally ended at 3:00 PM on the second afternoon of the election, when the ballot boxes were handed over to the vote counters. However, according to many years of established practice, the officer always stayed in the vote counting hall afterwards to assist the work of the vote counters. This kind of assistance was indeed regarded as indispensable for the sake of quick handling, and because of his assistance, the scope of the vote counters' responsibilities was covered up a lot. Therefore, in fact, the officer has assumed part of the responsibility of commanding the vote counting. Therefore, the committee deeply felt that "although this work of the Head of the Revenue Department came from habit, he should also share the responsibility for the occurrence of this error." As for the duties of the Director-General, if we look at the provisions of the Land Regulations, they are limited to representing the Municipal Council to notify the election of two officials and the vote counting of two vote counters. However, according to the resolution of the 1925 Taxpayer Annual Meeting, in order to maintain the secrecy of the election voting, the Director-General has the responsibility to burn the ballots afterwards. Other responsibilities actually assumed by the Director-General include the sealing of empty ballot boxes before the election, the subsequent meeting with the vote counters, the delivery of the keys to the ballot boxes, and the publication of the election results. However, according to the records, the responsibilities of the Director-General to the vote counters, as stipulated by the Land Regulations, have never been explained at the time of appointment. Therefore, to remedy this, the clauses of the Land Regulations regarding this matter should be attached when appointing vote counters in the future. Furthermore, the Director-General does not need to be present at the vote counting. What he should do is only to meet the vote counters before the vote counting starts, hand over the keys, and accept their report after the vote counting ends. However, also due to many years of practice, the Director-General always goes to the scene for a short time to inspect during the vote counting, and since 1933, the time of the Director-General's inspection has also increased, and this year is particularly so. According to the Director-General's statement, the purpose of this is only for assistance, but the committee deeply feels that "his stay in the vote counting hall, due to the lack of definition of his position, and the simultaneous presence of another senior official of the Municipal Council, with several assistants each, is the cause of the lack of command. Therefore, the officer has to share the responsibility for the occurrence of the error." All other personnel were subordinates of the Director-General and the Head of the Revenue Department and were ordered to come. Since there were no defined tasks, they were only assisting at any time.</p>
<p>Other Parts: The important parts of the investigation report also include the detailed methods for improving the election and vote counting procedures, the detailed rules for the responsibilities and tasks of the election personnel, and the clauses of the Land Regulations regarding elections, the resolution of the 1925 Taxpayer Annual Meeting regarding the secrecy of elections, and the procedures handled over the years. Due to the limited space, it is not possible to record them all.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry's Fishing Market: Inaugural Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Ice and Fresh Fish Industry's Decision to Participate is No Longer a Problem</p>
<p>The New News Agency reported that the Ministry of Industry, in order to control the fishing industry and relieve fishermen, has built a large fish market in Zhoujiazuidao, Yangshupu, Shanghai. The entire project was completed in November last year, but it has not yet opened due to unresolved organizational issues. After several consultations between Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, and Shanghai gentry and businessmen Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Shenzhi, and Lin Kanghou, it was decided to jointly operate the market by officials and businessmen, with a capital of 1.2 million national currency, divided into 12,000 shares, each share being 100 yuan. Officials and businessmen each account for half. Currently, the official shares of 600,000 have been fully paid by the Ministry of Industry. As for the business shares, except for the 150,000 yuan from the ice and fresh fish industry, which is to be decided today, the river fresh fish industry has already subscribed for 50,000 yuan. Another 100,000 yuan has been temporarily borrowed from the Bank of Communications, and the remaining 300,000 yuan will be fully subscribed by the Shanghai business community.</p>
<p>Ice and Fresh Fish Participate: The Ice and Fresh Fish Industry Association of this city initially strongly supported the principle of the Ministry of Industry's official-business joint venture fish market. However, more than 3,000 employees were deeply afraid that their livelihoods would be panicked after the opening of the fish market, so they put forward six points to request remedies. It is now learned that the association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon. After discussion, it was decided to participate with only some trivial issues. After negotiating and deciding today, they will subscribe for shares and join. Therefore, the opposition of the ice and fresh fish industry is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting: The inaugural meeting of the shareholders of the Shanghai Fishing Market Co., Ltd. of the Ministry of Industry will be held at the China &amp; South Sea Bank at 11:00 AM tomorrow (the 10th). The outside rumors that the shareholders' meeting would be held today are not accurate. As for the meeting location and time, it remains to be decided today. At that time, in addition to mutually electing eleven directors and five supervisors, the Ministry of Industry will appoint one person as chairman from the standing directors, and discuss the opening date and all preparatory matters. Official and business shareholders Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Shen Tianxin, etc. are all prepared to attend. The Ministry of Industry has sent the Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department to Shanghai to participate.</p>
<p>Preparing for Opening: The fish market is scheduled to officially open for business on the 19th of this month, but it must be approved by the shareholders' inaugural meeting on the 10th. As for the various projects of the market's buildings, such as cold storage, market, and floating dock, etc., they have been completed. The office and business places have also been arranged. The market's business methods will adopt a public auction system so that prices are uniform, eliminate manipulation and suppression, and gradually reduce the burden on depressed merchants and fishermen, and implement the rescue of China's endangered fishing industry.</p>
<h3>Cotton Industry Control Committee: Relieving Cotton Areas Nationwide</h3>
<p>Distributing 2,100 Tons of High-Quality Cotton Seeds; Improving Ginning and Adopting Saw-Tooth Gins</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi and other places in China are cotton-producing areas, with an annual output of about 110,000 dan. However, last year, Shandong, Henan, and Hubei provinces suffered from both drought and floods, and many cotton seeds were not sown. The output of various provinces across the country also decreased. Therefore, improving cotton production and revitalizing rural areas are urgent priorities. Mr. Ma Guangwen, a cotton expert from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, told a reporter from Shen Shi News Agency about the Cotton Industry Control Committee's methods for relieving cotton farmers this year, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Improving Cotton Seeds</p>
<p>In view of the fact that cotton seeds in various parts of China have gradually decreased each year due to poor storage by cotton farmers in the past, or mixed with inferior seeds, if high-quality seeds are not replaced in time, the cotton harvest in our country may be affected. This spring, the association specifically purchased 2,100 tons of S-type No. 4 cotton seeds from the United States, which arrived in Shanghai in March. In order to prevent the American cotton boll weevil from harming cotton, in order to prevent diseases and pests from American cotton, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau was ordered to fumigate and disinfect, and the cotton control association transported them to various provinces for distribution.</p>
<p>Relieving Cotton Farmers</p>
<p>The focus of relieving cotton-producing areas is mostly on the provinces in North China, because there is less rainfall in North China, and the weather and geography are suitable for planting cotton, which is better than provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang. Therefore, this association will use most of the 2,100 tons of cotton seeds to relieve cotton-producing areas in Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, and Shandong. The cotton seeds were fully distributed to various provinces last month.</p>
<p>Improving Ginning</p>
<p>China's industry is backward, and most machines are used in the old style. For example, the cotton gins used in various places, except for the roller gins used in Shanghai, Hankou and other places, are mostly foot-operated iron machines. It is difficult to select high-quality seeds after ginning with this kind of bad machine, and the cotton fiber is broken by the gin. In order to maintain the high-quality cotton seeds in various cotton-producing areas and improve the quality, the Cotton Industry Control Association plans to imitate the Egyptian cotton ginning method and purchase the latest steam flow saw-tooth cotton gins. It is heard that ginning with this machine can keep the cotton fiber in its original state, and the cotton seeds are not damaged.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang and Jiangxi Authorities Launch a Joint Special Products Exhibition</h3>

<p>Letter of Appointment of Committee Members</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Joint Special Products Exhibition sent letters yesterday to appoint Lu Xingzhuang, Zhang Zilian, Ma Jisheng, Jiang Zhonghe, etc. as committee members. The original letter read: "Dear Sirs, Since the railway connection between Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, transportation has become more convenient. In order to promote the special products of the two provinces, develop neighboring commercial ties, promote the production and sales of domestic goods, and promote economic prosperity, the two authorities, together with the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Joint Company, convened a meeting and decided to launch the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Joint Special Products Exhibition, and set up preparatory offices in the two provinces to be responsible for everything. The matter is of great importance, and it is not enough to widely collect leaders from all walks of life and jointly plan the progress. I have always known that you are concerned about industry, leading industry and commerce, and are enthusiastic about promoting production and developing the economy. Therefore, the preparatory committee has attached an appointment letter, the association's articles of association, and the organizational rules of the preparatory office, and asked to refer to them and agree to take on the position. It is a great honor for the public. At the same time, the association also sent letters to the Chinese Goods Factory Association to solicit manufacturers to participate."</p>

<p>bank to convene a shareholders' founding meeting.</p>
<p>The rumor that the shareholders' meeting will open today is incorrect. The meeting location and time are still to be decided today. At that time, in addition to mutually electing eleven directors and five supervisors, the Ministry of Industry will appoint one person as chairman from the standing directors, and discuss the opening date and all preparatory matters. Official and business shareholders, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Shen Tianxin, etc., are all prepared to attend. The Ministry of Industry has sent the Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department to Shanghai to participate.</p>
<p>Preparing for Opening: The fish market is scheduled to officially open for business on the 19th of this month, but it must be approved by the shareholders' founding meeting on the 10th. As for the various projects of the market's buildings, such as cold storage, market, and floating dock, etc., they have been completed. The office and business places have also been arranged.

<h3>Instructions from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Questions Regarding Affixing Stamps to Packing Lists, etc.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in a letter yesterday to the Gongji Glass Factory, responded to questions regarding affixing stamps to packing lists, etc., stating:</p>
<p>In response to your letter of the 7th of this month inquiring about stamp tax matters, we hereby provide the following itemized answers:</p>
<p>Both packing lists and loading slips are used to notify customers to inspect and receive goods when they are sent out. Therefore, based on their nature, they are considered invoices and should be stamped accordingly.</p>
<p>Article 17 of the Stamp Tax Law states that if the amount is not specified, the highest tax rate for the type of item listed should be applied. Therefore, if the invoice does not specify the price of the goods, it should be stamped at the highest rate of two cents. It is still advisable to list the price after the invoice is issued. If the price is not listed and a flat two-cent stamp is affixed, inspectors will still consider the stamp insufficient and impose a fine.</p>
<p>Shipping and allocation documents used internally between the factory and the warehouse are considered internal documents as defined in Article 3, Section 8 of the Stamp Tax Law. These documents do not create external rights or obligations and are different in nature from invoices and receipts used externally to obtain goods. Therefore, according to the law, they do not need to be stamped. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's decree No. 7213 dated September 21 of last year, it is also stated that for warehouses, factories, issuing offices, or branches of various businesses, although there may be a distinction between headquarters and branches, if their capital and operations are not independent but are in fact part of the same organization, then documents used for internal notification do not create external rights or obligations and do not need to be stamped. The regulations are clear and can be followed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Minting of 2-Cent Copper Subsidiary Coins: Ministry of Finance Responds to Chamber of Commerce Request for Relief</h3>

<p>"We have received your telegram. There is still a significant amount of existing subsidiary currency in circulation. We should wait until a substantial amount has been withdrawn before the Ministry considers the market situation and takes action. Please be informed."</p>
<h3>Order from the Municipal Party Headquarters: Prices for Various Sizes of Cloth Party and National Flags</h3>

<h3>Frequent Spring Rains: Stagnant Sales of Various Rice and Grains</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Fall by More Than 20 Cents</p>
<p>The Dagong Agency reports: Sales of rice and grain are usually sluggish around the Qingming Festival, commonly known as the "Spring Plague Festival." Due to frequent spring rains after the festival, the number of rice boats arriving in Shanghai from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Qingpu, Zhangjiagang, and other inland areas has decreased. There are only 30 to 40 boats at the wharves in the north and south of the city.</p>
<p>The total cargo is 60 dan, and the number of orders from merchants in Qingdao, Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and other areas is also not high. Therefore, rice prices in Shanghai have been slightly affected and have fallen by more than 20 cents in recent days. Yesterday, the opening prices on the morning and afternoon markets were $10.78 for Changbang Grade 1 rice and $8.50 to $9.30 for Grade 2 rice. The market price for Hunan indica rice remained stable with no increase or decrease. However, the sales volume of Bo rice is showing the most improvement.</p>

They plan to request that the Zhejiang Provincial Government extend the deadline to allow sufficient time to contact money lenders and prepare funds. A general meeting is scheduled for the 10th to discuss countermeasures. Yesterday, a notice was sent to all members stating:</p>

<h3>Report on the Disaster in Chuxian, Anhui</h3>
<p>The China Jisen Association has received a report from various legal entities in Chuxian County, Anhui Province, including the county party department, the disaster relief committee, the chamber of commerce, the farmers' association, and the finance committee, stating that Chuxian is strategically important but has suffered repeated military disasters since the Revolution. It was then ravaged by bandits in the northwest for over a decade, with thousands of villages plundered. This was followed by famine, leaving the rural areas bankrupt. The drought in 1934 and 1935 resulted in a harvest of less than 20%. People are fleeing everywhere, crying with hunger. Fortunately, there was little rain and snow last winter, so people were able to support the elderly and young and seek food in the south of the Yangtze River, barely surviving. Now that mid-spring has passed, farming is in full swing. Tens of thousands of disaster-stricken farmers, sent back from the capital, have no food, no clothing, no oxen, and no seeds. Their homes are empty, and smoke has ceased to rise from their chimneys. If spring farming is not carried out, what can be hoped for from the autumn harvest? In recent days, the number of disaster victims gathering and seeking relief has increased daily. There are indeed more than 60,000 people who will not survive without relief. Yesterday, the Third District Office of the county reported that in Sanxingji in the west of the county, families are starving to death in the streets of Jiuzhou, a sight that makes passersby weep. We beg you to provide the nectar of mercy and provide large-scale relief. The association previously received reports of severe disasters from Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Sichuan, and other provinces, which were reported in previous issues. Now, we have received a report from Chuxian describing an extremely severe disaster. With the spring famine in full swing, we hope that benevolent people will open their purses to provide relief, saving people from death and restoring them to life. The merit is immeasurable, and the rewards are beyond comprehension.</p>

However, due to the current financial constraints of the national treasury, we are unable to approve the subsidy. Please work with domestic manufacturers and chambers of commerce to raise funds for the project.' Based on the previous situation, we urge you to work with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in the Dutch Indies to raise funds for the project. This reply."</p>

<h3>China International Famine Relief Commission's Yunnan Branch Remits Relief Funds</h3>
<p>The China International Famine Relief Commission, located at No. 505 Henan Road, is a well-known domestic charitable organization. It has always been courageous in providing relief in the event of floods, droughts, and famines. It also works hard in peacetime on construction projects, hoping to prevent natural disasters through human effort. Last year, the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers flooded one after another, causing severe disasters that were rare in ancient times. The association was approved by the Ministry of Interior to carry out Jiang and Yellow River flood relief work, soliciting donations and providing relief to rescue the disaster-stricken people. Many were saved from death and given a chance to live. Recently, the spring famine in the disaster areas has been very severe. In addition to organizing work relief in northern Jiangsu, repairing roads and building embankments, it is also planning to continue releasing agricultural loans and purchasing seeds to facilitate spring plowing. The relief funds raised are about to be exhausted. Letters have been sent to the various branches urging them to remit the donated funds to facilitate distribution.

<h3>Chinese Detective Illegally Arrests Person Across Border: French Concession Taxpayers' Association Negotiates</h3>
<p>Requests Letter to French Municipal Council Demanding Chen Chengkun Be Transferred to Court</p>
<p>Huang Jiande, a clerk from the Jin Yu Law Firm at No. 68 Ningbo Road in the French Concession and a native of Suzhou, has been working there for two years. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 AM on the 7th (the day before yesterday), Chen Chengkun, a Chinese detective from the Public Concession police, went directly to Jin's law firm to arrest Huang Jiande. Chen claimed that Huang's cousin, Huang Dong, who works at Lao Jie Fu on Nanjing Road, was suspected of stealing forty yuan recently. He was taken to the Lujiawan police station in the French Concession. After the police station brought the defendant Huang Dong for questioning, it was found that Huang Jiande was not involved and was immediately released, which has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that Lawyer Jin believes that the detective abused his power to detain Huang and requested the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday to negotiate with the French Concession authorities based on reason. After receiving the letter, the Taxpayers' Association wrote to the French Municipal Council yesterday, requesting that Chen Chengkun be transferred to the court. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Regarding the letter from Chinese Committee Member Jin Liren stating that at 9:30 this morning, Chen Chengkun, a Chinese detective claiming to be from the British Concession police, suddenly came to our firm and illegally detained our clerk Huang Jiande at the French General Police Station. At the time, we were completely unaware of the reason. After investigation, it was said that his cousin, Huang Lian, was suspected of stealing cloth from the store. As British Concession detective Chen Chengkun did not consult with the French Concession police and did not present an arrest warrant, he illegally crossed the border and arrested a citizen without authorization, which has a significant impact on the public security of the concession residents. In addition to separately submitting requests to the French Consul General and the Director General of the French General Police Station to seriously negotiate with the British Concession police authorities in accordance with the law, and transferring the British Concession detective Chen Chengkun who illegally arrested the citizen and our firm's clerk Huang Jiande to the Second Special District Local Court for fair and lawful handling, we are reporting the situation of the British Concession detective's illegal arrest of the citizen in detail, hoping that your association will investigate and negotiate with the French authorities based on reason to reassure the law-abiding and deter the lawless, etc. In accordance with Article 8 of the Law of the Tutelage Period of the Republic of China, citizens shall not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished without due process of law, and Article 10 of the same law stipulates that citizens' residences shall not be entered, searched, or sealed without due process of law. However, Chen Chengkun, a Chinese detective claiming to be from the British Concession police, dared to enter a citizen's residence and illegally arrest a person without authorization. Our association deeply regrets this. Furthermore, even if Huang Jiande were suspected of theft, he should be summoned for questioning in accordance with the law, and even with a court warrant, the French Concession police should be consulted before making an arrest, which is the legal procedure. However, Chen Chengkun arrested the citizen without authorization and without due process of law. Such disregard for the law must be severely punished to serve as a warning. Fortunately, Chinese Committee Member Jin deeply understands the law, and the clerk Huang Jiande was not wrongly accused. In order to uphold the law, our association requests that your council order the Director General of the General Police Station to transfer Chen Chengkun to the court for investigation and also seriously negotiate with the Public Concession authorities to prevent such incidents from happening again. This is of utmost importance. This is addressed to the French Concession Municipal Council." At the same time, a letter was sent to the Public Concession Taxpayers' Association, which forwarded it to the Public Concession Standing Bureau for negotiation, etc.</p>

<h3>Robbers Murder Victim in Yangsi Bridge, Pudong</h3>
<h3>Three Robbers, Each Wielding Iron Bars, Tie Up Everyone's Hands; Old Woman Shouts, is Stabbed in Throat, Suffocates and Dies</h3>
<p>—Plunder Lasts for Three Hours—</p>
<p>A robbery occurred in Lujiayan, Yangsi District, Pudong, the night before last, resulting in the victim's death. The details are recorded below. Zhou Jinlan, a local resident of No. 3 Lujiayan, northeast of Yangsi Bridge in Yangsi District, Pudong, works as a cook at Zheng Yixing Niupihao in the South City Dama Tou. His son, Zhou Jinfa, works as a salesman at the Da Zhonghua Shoe Lace Factory in Dama Tou and does not often return to the village. The day before yesterday, Zhou Jinfa took leave to return home for the Qingming Festival to sweep the ancestral tombs. Everyone went to bed at night. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 PM that night, several robbers came to the Zhou house, broke open the side door, and three robbers entered, each wielding an iron bar. The others stood guard outside. They first broke into Zhou Jinfa's bedroom, tied up Jinfa and his wife with ropes, and silenced them. Then, they broke into the adjacent bedroom of Jinlan's cousin, Zhou Jiyu, followed by the bedroom of Jiyu's son, Zhou Haigen, and tied them up in the same way. Then, they drove Zhou Jinfa and his wife into Zhou Jiyu's room, where one robber guarded them, while two robbers returned to Zhou Jinlan's bedroom. Zhou's wife, Zhou Xi (age fifty-two), woke up in her sleep upon hearing the noise and shouted for help. The two robbers, angered by her shouting, rushed forward and grabbed her throat, tying her arms with grass ropes. As she was old and weak, she was unable to struggle. After a while, she suffocated and died. The robbers then divided up and searched for three hours, carrying away the stolen goods. After the robbers left, those who had been tied up were able to free themselves. Zhou Jinfa went to his mother Zhou Xi's room to check on the situation and found her lying on the bed, already dead. Upon inspecting the surrounding bedrooms, a total of 108 yuan in legal tender, one gold chain, one silver chain, one gold ring, three gold buttons, one silver watch, one flannel shirt, one flannel vest, and one woolen twill trousers were stolen. Zhou Jinfa reported to the Yangsi Bridge Police Station and requested that the robbers be arrested. Officer Xiao Jingfu of the station led police officers to search in all directions, but as the robbers had been gone for a long time, they were nowhere to be found. He then returned to the victim's house to investigate. An iron bar, a blue cloth short shirt, a dark blue hat, two pawn tickets, and two pairs of trousers were found in the room and taken back to the police station. The situation was reported to the Tangqiao Police Station for review. Yesterday morning, the local bailiff Xie Zhaogen of the 10th and 11th districts was instructed to report to the local court prosecutor's office for examination. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Lei Binzhang and Inspector Shen Qixiu were commissioned to cross the river to Pudong for the examination.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Gloomy Weather, Strong Winds and Rain</h3>
<p>Sudden Drop in Temperature: River and Sea Vessels Obstructed</p>
<p>Since the thunderstorms the day before yesterday, the city has experienced continuous rain throughout the night. The eaves dripped all night long. Yesterday, the sky began to clear after dawn. Around 8:00 AM, sunlight even broke through. Before long, the sky clouded over again. By noon, dark clouds gathered from all directions, making it as dark as dusk. Lights had to be turned on indoors, and vehicles on the streets drove slowly. It was difficult to see clearly more than a few steps away, as if it were night. At the same time, strong winds roared, and windows rattled. Pedestrians rushed along, holding their heads and hats. Around 1:00 PM, heavy rain began to fall, lasting until 3:00 PM in the afternoon, while the strong winds have not stopped until this morning, and the weather has turned cold.</p>
<p>Winds Block River Ships</p>
<p>The weather was bad in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River yesterday morning. A low-pressure system passed through from 32 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. By noon, it reached Shanghai and entered the Yangtze River, causing strong winds and heavy rain in Wuhu. The river surface was turbulent with waves, and all ships in Wuhu were obstructed. All loading and unloading operations were suspended. The shipping companies received telegrams, and the situation only subsided slightly in the evening.</p>
<p>Fog Blocks Sea Ships</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan ship, which departed from Shanghai for Shantou, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 7th, encountered extremely strong winds and heavy fog at around 4:00 AM yesterday in the sea area near Tanting Island. The ship's navigation was very dangerous. It anchored and stopped sailing. After the wind subsided slightly, it resumed its journey. However, when it approached the sea area near Steep Island, the weather became even worse. Fearing danger, the Haiyuan ship anchored to avoid the wind and fog and telegraphed Shanghai for information. Various sea ships arriving in Shanghai from South China and those exporting from Shanghai were also obstructed by the fog along the way.</p>
<h3>Shengjing Ship's Russian Policeman Kicking a Laborer to Death: Trial Concludes</h3>
<p>Sentence to be Pronounced on the 14th</p>
<p>Kexin (transliteration), a Russian policeman escorting cargo on the Taikoo Company's Shengjing ship, kicked a laborer named Afu to death while trying to expel him. Tang Rushou, a prosecutor from the local court, examined the body and confirmed that Afu died from his injuries. Kexin was arrested and interrogated, and a public prosecution was filed against him for causing death by injury under Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. At 3:00 PM yesterday, Judge Wu Deyi presided over the third trial in the Criminal Court. The defendant hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng to appear in court on his behalf. First, the testimony of Cheng Yongnian, an investigator from the water police, was presented, followed by the testimony of Zhang Maosheng, age forty, a native of Ningbo and a dock worker. He testified that around 7:00 PM on March 22nd, he was expelled by the defendant on the Shengjing ship and kicked violently five times. The deceased, Afu, was our companion and was also kicked violently four times by the defendant. He fell from the ladder and died within half an hour. Judge Wu ordered the detained Kexin to be brought to the case for questioning. Kexin, age thirty-five, a Russian national working as a security guard on the Shengjing ship, stated that on the evening in question, while he was on duty, he saw six or seven dock workers sleeping on the deck. He expelled them, only using his feet to push them away and chase them away, and did not kick them violently. He asked for clarification. At this point, Prosecutor Tang entered the court and presented his prosecution. The debate then began and was considered concluded. The sentence was scheduled to be pronounced at 10:00 AM on the 14th of this month, and the defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Lawyer He Ji Detained in Connection with Fraud and Defamation Case</h3>
<p>Someone Sues in Wuxian Local Court; Result: Surrendered Himself with Two Shop Guarantees</p>
<p>Lawyer He Ji, styled Zhuowei, is fifty-seven years old this year, a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang. In May of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), he became a member of the Shanghai Lawyers' Association and established his office on the fifth floor of the Dalu Department Store on Nanjing Road. He lives at No. 98 Huayuanfang, Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession. Recently, Zhu Xiongwu and others filed a lawsuit in the Wuxian Local Court, accusing He Ji of fraud and defamation. He Ji is suspected of being involved in the case, so the Wuxian Local Court secretly telegraphed the Shanghai Second Special Court to assist in summoning him the day before yesterday. After receiving the telegram, the court notified the judicial advisory office yesterday to dispatch Jingmu Mai Wenjin to arrest He at his address. He was arrested and sent to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. First, the Jingmu stated that when he was ordered to make the arrest, the defendant He Ji claimed that his name was Wu Jinsheng, not He Ji, and that He Ji had already left and was not in Shanghai. Fortunately, someone pointed out that he was He Ji before he was arrested. When questioned, He Ji said, "I have already sent a letter to the Wuxian Local Court stating that I would surrender myself immediately."

Judge Li Changnian ordered He Ji to provide two guarantees from chain shops to appear in court and ordered him to surrender himself to the Wuxian Local Court for questioning.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Prostitute as a Daughter to Extort Money from a Brothel</h3>
<p>Zhou Hongbao is Confirmed to Have Committed Fraud; Father and Son Qu Shuangxi Seemingly Deceived</p>
<p>Wang Zhangshi, a 42-year-old brothel owner from Suzhou, operates a brothel at No. 17 Bing'an Lane, Avenue Edward VII, in the French Concession. She employs over a dozen prostitutes who, as soon as the lanterns light up, go to entertainment venues to solicit customers. On the 6th, a man from Jiangbei named Zhou Hongbao, 41 years old, residing at No. 17 Tongyu Lane, Luban Road, Nanshi, accompanied by his fellow townsman Qu Shuangxi, 51 years old, and Qu Mujin, 24 years old, a father and son, went to the brothel. They claimed that the prostitute Jin Di, 18 years old, was Qu Shuangxi's biological daughter who had been abducted and sold into prostitution two years ago. They demanded a ransom of 300 yuan for her release, threatening drastic measures otherwise. They negotiated at Room 30, Chunjiang Hotel, Xinxinqiao Street. Brothel owner Wang Zhangshi outwardly agreed but secretly reported to the police. Detective Zhou Bingcheng and Bao Tan Xu Jinlong were dispatched to Chunjiang Hotel, where they arrested Zhou and the two Qu's. Yesterday, they were brought before the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. First, police lawyer Yuan Jiahong presented the case, followed by brothel owner Wang Zhangshi recounting the events. When questioned, Zhou Hongbao claimed that a relative, Qu Shuangxi, had a daughter abducted a few years ago and asked him to help find her. Coincidentally, the person saw the plaintiff's slave girl Jin Di at the Great World entertainment center, resembling Qu Shuangxi's lost daughter. Therefore, the person reported to the Qu father and son, who came to Shanghai to identify her, but the identification was negative, and the matter was dropped. Suddenly, an unknown Ying A'er came forward and told the person that brothel owner Zhangshi was willing to pay to settle the matter. Therefore, the person accompanied the Qu father and son to Room 30, Chunjiang Hotel, to negotiate. He provided evasive answers. Qu Shuangxi and Qu Mujin, father and son, both stated that Zhou Hongbao had indeed asked them to come to Shanghai to identify the prostitute. However, they had never identified Jin Di as the lost daughter and had not threatened or extorted the plaintiff. They were simply deceived by Zhou. The police lawyer stated that the first defendant had been proven to have committed extortion, but the criminal suspicion of the second and third defendants could not be proven, requesting a lawful investigation. Judge Li Changnian ruled to detain Zhou Hongbao, while Qu Shuangxi and Qu Mujin, father and son, were released on bail, with temporary detention for those unable to provide bail. The verdict is scheduled for the 11th.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Tax Collector Lin Hongru Arrested</h3>
<p>Accused of Embezzling Three Thousand Yuan in Taxes; to be Escorted to Qingpu for Interrogation</p>
<p>Lin Hongru, a 38-year-old native of Qingpu, served as a tax collector for the Qingpu County Government. In August of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Qingpu County Government Tax Collection Office was ordered to be abolished, and Lin was dismissed. He resided at No. 51 Hongrui Lane, Changsha Road, in the Shanghai Public Concession. Recently, the Qingpu County Government discovered that Lin Hongru had embezzled three thousand yuan in taxes during his tenure and issued a warrant to the Shanghai First Special District Court, which was handed over to the Xinzha Police Station. Yesterday morning at 10:30, Huatan Ruan Yao was specially dispatched to No. 51 Hongrui Lane, Changsha Road, to arrest Lin and detain him at the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the above information. When questioned, Lin Hongru stated that he had served as a tax collector for the county government since April of the 18th year of the Republic (1929), with a monthly salary of only sixteen yuan. In August of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the agency was ordered to be abolished, and he was dismissed. All the agency's account books were not handed over to the director. The current director, Wu, was reportedly also detained. The missing three thousand yuan was not embezzled but was a shortfall in payment. He is currently suffering from severe tuberculosis and requested temporary admission to a hospital. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the confession and ruled that Lin Hongru should be transferred for further investigation, with notification to the Qingpu County Government to send police to escort him. Before the transfer, he was temporarily detained at the police station's patrol hospital pending pickup.</p>

<h3>Japanese Woman's Tragic Death Case Solved: Murderer is the Woman's Lover, Tanaka Hide, Arrested After the Japanese Police Station's Vigorous Investigation</h3>
<p>On the upper floor of the Hongyuan grocery store at No. 279 Miller Road, Hongkou, owned by Ningbo native Chen Hongyuan, lived a Japanese couple named Matsushima Yoshiki. Later, Matsushima moved out due to his work at the Japanese Telegraph Office, which made commuting inconvenient. However, the Matsushima couple had a very close relationship with the Chen couple. When they moved, they introduced a middle-aged Japanese woman to rent the house, agreeing on a monthly rent of 21 yuan in national currency. However, the woman had nothing of value except the clothes on her back. Even the bedding used in the house was taken from what the Matsushima couple had left behind. Since moving in, the woman was never seen doing anything and spent her days wandering the streets. In the evening, people of the opposite sex would come and go. However, the woman had installed an electric bell at the back door of the house and always opened the door herself, so others could not see who she was meeting. Unexpectedly, at noon on the 3rd of last month (March), the Chen Hongyuan couple heard a sound like a raccoon calling from the upper floor. They had not seen the woman for several days and became suspicious. They invited a Japanese neighbor to help them open the door to investigate and discovered that the woman had been dead for many days, in a very horrifying state. They immediately reported to the police station, and the Japanese consulate was notified to conduct a joint examination. It was determined that she had been strangled to death and had had sexual intercourse before her death. However, the identity of the murderer had not been found for a long time, forming a pending case. The details were also reported in this newspaper on March 4th. Now, it is learned that the police station and the Japanese police station spent more than a month investigating and learned that the woman's name was Marumoto Ko, who was a prostitute. The reason for her death was a love triangle. The murderer was one of the woman's lovers, named Tanaka Hide Saburo. He was the one who had met Marumoto Ko at her residence on the afternoon of February 29th. He then colluded with three accomplices to stab her to death with a sharp blade and fled without a trace. The Japanese police station increased its reward to further investigate. Yesterday afternoon, they learned that the main suspect, Tanaka Hide Saburo, was hiding at No. 19 Douhua Lane, Xihua Road. They immediately joined forces with Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Police Station and rushed to the address at around 7 PM and arrested Tanaka Hide Saburo on the spot. He was taken back to the Japanese Police Station and is currently under strict interrogation.</p>

<h3>Many Love Affairs at Minhua Elementary School: Female Teacher Sues for Obscenity; Shen Shuqing Accuses Yu Shangxun and Yu Xiangquan; Trial Opened Yesterday, Both Sides Seeking Reconciliation</h3>
<p>In January of this year, an interesting lawsuit that caused a sensation in society occurred at Minhua Elementary School, No. 10 Shangwen Lane, No. 251 Weihaiwei Road. The fact was that the school principal, Yu Shangxun (26 years old) from Ningbo, reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station that a teacher, Ding Jiasheng (also known as Ding Hao) from this city, had committed theft, stealing a Western suit worth tens of yuan. Police officers arrested Ding and found several pawn tickets in his suitcase. After reviewing them, one or two items were found to belong to the stolen goods reported by Yu. A public prosecution was filed on the charge of theft. Ding Jiasheng claimed that Principal Yu had stolen his love and deliberately framed him to remove a thorn in his side because he had an affair with a female teacher at the same school, Shen Shuqing (25 years old) from Jiaxing. Now Yu suddenly fell in love with Shen Shuqing, and Shen also transferred her love to Yu, creating a love triangle. The court paid close attention to this issue and summoned Shen Shuqing to court. Shen firmly denied having an affair with Ding and Yu. Ding presented underwear, corsets, and qipaos hidden in her suitcase as evidence. The judge ordered Shen to try them on in court. After the case was published in the newspapers, Minhua Elementary School and Shen Shuqing suddenly sent letters to various newspapers, explaining everything. Shen Shuqing graduated from Jiaxing Women's Normal School, received higher education, and has been a teacher for a long time. She had also been married to someone, and that person was a civil servant in a certain agency in this city. Therefore, at the time, everyone believed that Ding was deliberately insulting her personality. Before long, Shen hired two lawyers and filed a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Yu Shangxun and a person named Yu Xiangquan of violating Article 225 of the Criminal Law, "Raping a woman by taking advantage of her mental incapacity or other similar circumstances in which she cannot resist," and Article 229 of the same law, "Using fraudulent means to make a woman mistakenly believe that the person is her spouse and submit to sexual intercourse," for the crime of obscenity. After the court issued summonses, Yu Shangxun's summons was delivered to No. 10 Shangwen Lane, Weihaiwei Road, and signed by Yu himself. Yu Xiangquan's summons could not be delivered because the person was not in Shanghai, so the bailiff returned it to the court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui opened the Eighth Criminal Court and summoned Yu Shangxun. When Yu Shangxun did not appear, the plaintiff's attorney stated that the case was currently in the process of reconciliation, so he requested a ten-day extension for another hearing. Judge Liu then summoned Shen Shuqing to the stand. After inquiring about her age and origin, the plaintiff's attorney again stated that the case was in the process of reconciliation and that there was hope for a peaceful resolution. To avoid exposing the facts of the case to society and the publication of reports, he requested that the facts not be inquired into. If reconciliation was not possible, a decision would be made to inquire again. The court approved the request and declared that if reconciliation was reached, the crime under Article 225 of the Criminal Law could be withdrawn. However, the crime under Article 229 of the Criminal Law could not be withdrawn according to law. The court granted a ten-day postponement, and the case was rescheduled for another hearing at 2:00 PM on April 17th.</p>

<h3>Medical News</h3>
<p>New Medical and Pharmaceutical Publishing News. The debate between Chinese and Western medicine in China has not yet been resolved. Western medicine's theories are precise, but its treatments often have drawbacks. Chinese medicine's prescriptions are effective, but its explanations are often mysterious. Therefore, this journal believes that Chinese medicine should be scientific, and Western medicine should incorporate Chinese medicines. Mr. Ye Juquan of Wuxing is well aware of this problem and has studied Chinese and Western medicine, incorporating all schools of thought and drawing from his knowledge to create a "Collection of Modern Internal Medicine Chinese Herbal Prescriptions." He treats diseases with Chinese medicine and explains them with scientific reasoning. The first volume, "Infectious Diseases," has now been published by the Shanghai Family Industry Society. The book is printed on Chinese Lian Shi paper in a movable type, finely printed, and bound in two thick volumes. It sells for one yuan in national currency, with an additional 1 jiao and 3 fen for postage outside of Shanghai. The general distribution office is the Cunji Medical Hut in Shuanglin, Zhejiang.

<h3>Shanghai's Ham Sales Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Chief Editor of Chinese WeChat</p>
<p>(A General Overview of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce, Part 21)</p>
<p>Northern ham is produced in the Rugao area of Jiangsu, with Rugao having the highest production, followed by Taixing and Jiangdu. Because they are all in Jiangbei, it is called Northern ham. In recent years, the sales of Northern ham have been poor, and production has decreased, even more so than Southern ham. According to investigations, the total production of Northern ham last year was no more than 300,000 pieces, a decrease of 30-40% compared to the previous year. Domestically, Shanghai is the largest market, and internationally, the Philippines is the largest market. Ham is transported from the production area of Rugao to Shanghai in sacks, with 50 pieces per bag, weighing 300 catties. They are first transported by civilian boats or small steamers to Xinsheng Port in Rugao or Tiansheng Port in Nantong, and then transported to Shanghai by Dadat or Datong Shipping Company ships. There are two methods of promotion: one is to have distribution offices in Shanghai (such as Rugao Ham Stores, China Ham Company, Tonghe Tai, Wang Yuchang, etc.), which sell directly; the other is for producers without distribution offices in Shanghai to form joint ventures with Shanghai ham merchants and entrust them with sales, providing a reasonable commission. The ham merchants still existing in Rugao and Taixing counties are listed below:</p>
<p>Yunnan ham is traditionally said to be produced in Tengyue, Yunnan (some say it is produced in Xuanwei, but Shanghai ham merchants all label it as Xuanwei Yunnan Ham). According to people in the industry, Sichuan also produces ham, which is often mixed with Yunnan ham and sold on the market. Yunnan farmers make ham using traditional methods and do not know how to improve them. They simply chop off the pig's ribs along with the breast and do not trim them. Therefore, the ham is large and square, heavy but not beautiful compared to Northern and Southern ham (each piece weighs more than ten catties). However, the meat is tender and more delicious than Jiang ham. But because it contains too much fat (accounting for half of the entire ham), it does not suit the taste of the people in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so it cannot be sold well in Shanghai. Yunnan ham is mostly transported to Shanghai by Yunnan merchants, mostly stored in wooden boxes, with only ten or so pieces per box. From the place of production to Shanghai, it often passes through Hong Kong, and the freight is quite expensive, so the selling price is also very high. The city's sales are only six or seven hundred pieces a year, which is very limited.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of the Editorial Department:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the news in your newspaper about a strike by workers at our factory due to dissatisfaction with the management. After learning about this, we were extremely surprised. Our factory has been in operation for three years, and the relationship between labor and management has been harmonious. There has never been any dissatisfaction, let alone a strike. On the 6th and 21st of each month, when shifts are changed, the factory is scheduled to shut down for those two days to allow for the repair of machinery. If there is urgent work, the factory does not shut down and double wages are paid. Overtime is also paid according to the law, with their consent, and there are no objections. It is likely that troublemakers are making something out of nothing, intentionally causing chaos. We are deeply concerned that the outside world may not understand the truth, so we are writing this letter to clarify and request a correction. We look forward to your favorable response.</p>

<p>After reading your newspaper on the 7th, I was surprised to learn that since the official announcement by the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange on August 1st of last year to formally auction Japanese yarn, in just over nine months, Japanese yarn such as Rihua Factory's Blue Phoenix, Toyota Factory's Fengnian, Nei Wai Cotton Factory's Shuiyue Caiqiu, Shanghai Factory's Nikko, Qingdao Gongda Factory's Baolai, and Wu Ma, etc., accounted for more than 70-80% of the market transactions, while Chinese merchants only managed to maintain a position in the market with Shenxin Factory's Ren Zhong and a few other brands. Learning from past mistakes, if this continues for some time, I fear that Chinese yarn will be unable to maintain its position. After reviewing your newspaper, I was deeply astonished. The cotton yarn transacted in our market is all Tungi Factory's Golden Rooster standard, and delivery must be made according to our exchange's cotton yarn grade table upon maturity. The cotton yarn currently stored in our warehouse for delivery is all 20-count Hong Kuixing yarn, 20-count Tianguan yarn, 20-count Jincheng yarn, 20-count Da Feiting yarn, 20-count Qiqiu yarn, 20-count Jin Shuangma yarn, 20-count Shuanglu yarn, 20-count Xingshi yarn, 20-count Siji Dafa yarn, 20-count Jinji yarn, 20-count Sanxing yarn, 20-count Zhinv yarn, 20-count Cai Feiji yarn, 20-count Shuang Diqiu yarn, 20-count Jinta yarn, 20-count Muyang yarn, 20-count Qiuhe yarn, 20-count Dan Diqiu yarn, 20-count Cai Kuixing yarn, 20-count Sanyang yarn, 20-count Wufu yarn, 20-count Bao Yarn, 20-count Hongfu yarn, 16-count Shuanglong yarn, 10-count Hong Kuixing yarn, and other Chinese factory cotton yarns, which are obviously present. Your newspaper's report is not only without basis but also contradicts the facts. It is unavoidable to spread rumors. Therefore, I am writing this letter to request an immediate correction to clarify the facts. This is our sincere hope.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order on Uniform Sales Methods for Textbooks</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 7th, stating that the pricing of textbooks published by various publishers is not realistic, and outdated textbooks are often sold in remote provinces and counties. Distributors often arbitrarily increase prices and manipulate discounts under the pretext of increasing transportation costs, which has a significant impact on education and requires rectification. The Shanghai Education Bureau was instructed to instruct the Shanghai Book Industry Association to convene a meeting as soon as possible to formulate uniform sales methods for textbooks and submit them for review. The bureau reported that the uniform sales methods for textbooks had been formulated by the Book Industry Association and submitted for review. The ministry reviewed the proposed methods and found them feasible, except for some minor modifications. The order is hereby issued for your information and for distribution to all bookstores under your jurisdiction for compliance.</p>
<p>Attached are the uniform sales methods for textbooks and other books: All books, whether textbooks for large, medium, or small schools, or ordinary new or old books, should be marked with a price; The price of textbooks should be based on the cost of editing and printing, and should be set as low as possible; All books should be sold at the marked price at the door, and no discounts or markups are allowed; For books that have already been published, if the original discount resulted in a higher price, the publisher should immediately review and reduce the price, mark the actual price on the inside cover. In the future, if the price of paper or other reasons require increasing or decreasing the price, the publisher may still make appropriate increases or decreases, but the door must be sold at the final increased or decreased price, without discounts or markups. Price increases or decreases, if textbooks, should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval at any time; Books may be sold for pre-sale or special prices, but all should be sold at 70% or more of the marked price; Books may be sold with discounts only in the following cases: A. Wholesale commission for the same industry, determined by the industry association; B. School bookstores or cooperatives at 90% of the marked price; C. Libraries at 90% of the marked price, but only two copies of the same book are allowed, and five copies of dictionaries; D. Shareholders or employees of the publisher at 90% of the marked price, but only one copy of ordinary books is allowed, and two copies of textbooks; E. Authors who purchase their own books at 70% of the marked price. If the copyright is jointly owned, no royalties are given, and the price is 60% of the marked price, limited to 30 copies; Publishers or sellers may not hold low-price sales or give away book coupons in the name of commemoration; Books that are unsalable or damaged may be sold in a special discount section, with no discount limit, but the cover must be stamped with the original price section mark; For books sold outside the publisher's main store, a surcharge for remittance and transportation costs may be added, but not exceeding the actual need; The Ministry of Education orders all publishers and sellers of books nationwide to comply with the above provisions. Violations may be effectively regulated by the local industry association or any member of the same industry who requests the local government.</p>
<h3>Review of Textbooks Requires Payment of Review Fee</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 7th, stating that according to Article 4 of the revised regulations for the review of textbooks promulgated by the ministry, textbooks submitted for review should be submitted together with the manuscript and sample copies, and review fees should be paid in proportion to the price of the entire book. The education departments of various provinces submit self-edited or代送edited books by others, requesting review, and often do not pay the review fee or the payment does not meet the regulations. In order to effectively comply with the law, all books submitted for review in the future must comply with the current regulations.

<p>6.  Family Liaison Methods</p>
<p>The school has been quite effective in implementing methods for connecting with students' families. The liaison method is to use a school-family communication booklet. This booklet is printed in the form of a handbook and is intended for one year of use. The method of application is as follows: Teachers give this booklet to the students every Saturday to take home and ask their parents to read it. After the parents have read the booklet, they return it to the child on Monday to take to school for the teacher to review. When parents read this booklet, they can sign their opinions or raise questions for discussion with the school. If there are no opinions or questions to raise, they sign their name to indicate they have read it. When teachers review this booklet, they can answer the parents' opinions or questions. Teachers can also sign or raise opinions about a certain student in this booklet for discussion with the parents. When new students enroll, their parents must leave a sample signature in this booklet to prevent students from faking signatures in the future.</p>
<p>The various items included in this communication booklet are worth introducing here. The first item in the communication booklet is to ask parents to fill in the student's name, date of birth, parents' names, address, telephone number, etc., for the school to verify. Below is a clear explanation of the school's grading methods for parents' reference. The second item lists the school's general admission rules, including arrival time, cloakroom, lunch arrangements, leave of absence procedures, suspension and expulsion procedures, self-study homework arrangements, etc. Then, a parents-teacher communication guide is attached, hoping that parents will make the most of this communication booklet and often exchange information with the school to jointly seek the welfare of children. The third item lists several school health guidelines, such as the requirement for new students to have a doctor's certificate before enrollment, vaccination methods, isolation dates for infectious diseases, and various school suspension and disinfection methods. The fourth item is to list the children's academic performance in each subject, with each two weeks as a unit. Teachers can fill in the children's academic performance in each subject for two weeks so that parents can understand their children's academic progress in two weeks. On the other hand, there is a blank form regarding the child's behavior, and parents and teachers can record the child's behavior observed in two weeks for each other's reference. Several copies of this academic and behavioral record sheet are listed for use in one semester. The fifth item is to list the child's academic performance and behavior record sheet for one semester, which can replace the end-of-semester report card. The last paragraph is also attached with the principal's comments on the student's academic and behavioral aspects in one semester. The sixth item is to list a comparative table of the child's work status in one academic year, which represents the child's work performance in one academic year on a monthly basis based on performance points using a curve. Parents can see from this curve whether their children's academic performance is improving or declining at a glance. According to the principal's opinion, the school has used this communication booklet for many years and deeply feels that this booklet is of great help to the connection between the family and the school.</p>
<p>Note: The school welcomes people from the education community to visit on weekdays, but they must first contact the Education Supervisor of the French Municipal Council or the school principal.</p>

<h3>Commodity Sales Gradually Flourish, Tightening Loans is the Only Shortcoming</h3>
<p>According to commercial customs, commodity sales are active every year at the end of mid-spring. Although this year is shrouded in economic downturn, the sales of general imported goods are still prosperous, and the sales of domestic goods have also increased accordingly. However, the tightening of silver and money is a major shortcoming. As for the money market, the overnight ocean rate was still 8 points yesterday morning, and the transfer of funds was relatively rare, only more than 2.2 million, and the transfer of tickets and funds was even rarer. The turnover in the morning market was only more than 2.9 million, the new turnover was more than 400,000, the noon market turnover was more than 500,000, the turnover in the Small General Association was more than 300,000, the turnover of ocean pledge loans was more than 700,000 for taking out loans, the turnover of making loans was more than 300,000, mostly transfers. The turnover of banknotes included the recovery of more than 400,000 secret tickets, the issuance of 1.2 million local tickets, and 700,000 foreign tickets. The amount of long-term loans settled (10th) was expected to be more than 200,000 to be received, and 3-400,000 to be released, which has not yet been determined and must be decided today and tomorrow.

In summary, the current receipt and settlement is very different from today last year, which is probably due to the different market environment. The auxiliary currency Guangdong small ocean fell into the open market within 12 corners, which was 11 corners 9 minutes and 7 cents, and the turnover was allowed to be rare and the sales were sluggish. The turnover in the morning market was only 15,000 corners, there was no turnover in the noon market, and the copper coins were still 302,000 articles, with a turnover of 1-2,600 strings, equivalent to 4,200 legal currency.</p>

<h3>American Chinese Bank Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>This year, the silver and money industry is tightening, overdrafts are being made, and loans are not being made as much as possible, resulting in a sluggish market and extremely difficult turnover for various merchants. Foreign merchants, seeing the financial dryness in Shanghai, seized the opportunity to invest, and foreign merchants from England and the United States jointly created the American Chinese Bank on the side of Er Ma Road, with strong capital. It opened yesterday. According to its business plan, it aims to support small businesses. All merchants with a little credit can make loans as much as possible. Therefore, on the opening day yesterday, general merchants carried money to open accounts, and they were crowded and abnormal, and the income deposits were very large. According to the bank authorities, loans can be promoted without restriction, which is true, and Shanghai's finance can flow slightly.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Only Has Swap Trading</h3>
<p>The Total Turnover is Less Than One Million, The Market Will be Closed for Four Days Starting Tomorrow for Spring Break</p>
<p>The stock market of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange was even more sluggish yesterday, and the turnover was even rarer. Due to the relationship of the four-day spring break, new transactions were mostly extinct. In addition to a few swap transactions on the market, few people were interested, and the environmental situation was confusing, making it even more difficult to adapt. Therefore, as a result of waiting and seeing, the turnover became more depressed. The low turnover yesterday was also unprecedented. The market situation went through the whole day, and each round was hovering between 5 cents and 1 corner, and the market was also high and low. Each transaction was only a very small number of transactions, and there were those who did not open at all. Each round of meeting time was only a few minutes to complete. Although the external situation seems to have a change in the future, people's hearts are still not slightly impacted by it. The market price does not move, and if there is a slight change, it will drop sharply before there is a transaction. The result of yesterday's market price was high and low. Mostly, the current month was small 5 cents and 1 corner to 1 corner and a half, and June was mostly good 5 cents and 1 corner. This is due to the swap relationship of the long side. The total turnover, including 9.621 million, was only 985,000 yuan, and a new record for the least turnover of the stock exchange was discovered. The results of its rise and fall are compared in the table on the left (unit yuan transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Approaching Easter, New York Stock Market Mixed and Stagnant</h3>

However, Changfeng continues to make purchases, stabilizing the market.</p>
<p>May Futures Yarn Up One Yuan</p>

<h3>Grains: Foreign Wheat Continues to Rise; Wheat Flour Futures Inspire Optimism</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, spot flour sales were active both in the north and south. The continuous rise in foreign wheat prices has instilled optimism among outside investors. The weather has turned from warm to cold, and incessant thunderstorms have caused widespread concern about damage to new wheat seedlings. Inland dealers were the first to stop selling, and speculators rushed to cover their short positions, while large outside investors resumed absorption. With sellers remaining cautious, the market rose gradually. The distant months are expected to be driven by foreign wheat prices, and the abnormal weather has inspired optimism.</p>
<p>The wheat market continues to report rising prices from overseas dispatches, with domestic spot shortages. Outside investors have remained optimistic. Yesterday, the abnormal weather caused both short covering and new buying to be unusually active, and inland merchants ceased selling. The market opened higher. In the afternoon, the rise in the flour market further enlivened the market. Near and far months rose by nearly 1 cent. Spot wheat holders called for prices to rise by nearly 1 cent, but factories were unwilling to raise prices to buy, resulting in no sales throughout the day.</p>
<p>Reports of damage to wheat crops in the southwest of the United States have been numerous, but the impact has been minimal due to the prospect of bumper harvests in other areas.</p>
<h3>Outside Speculators Fear Monopoly; Soybean Oil Cakes Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Soybean futures closed above the six-yuan mark. Foreign merchants are also optimistic about sesame seeds.</p>
<p>The standard soybean oil cake market suddenly soared, mainly due to the rising trend of soybean futures. Recently, spot soybean arrivals have been scarce, production prices have gradually increased, and Dalian dispatches have also reported daily increases. Yesterday's dispatch reported another increase. Moreover, outside speculators fear that international disputes may lead to a monopoly on soybean oil, so absorption has been even stronger. Yesterday morning, standard truck soybeans had already risen by about 1 cent. In the afternoon, spot and Dalian dispatches further boosted the market. The May soybean futures closed at 5.74 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday's closing price broke through the six-yuan mark, reaching 6.08 yuan, a significant increase of 3.4 cents. Bullish sentiment in soybean oil was also strong, with prices rising by 4 or 5 cents. Standard oil cakes also rose by about 4 cents. Foreign merchants have recently inquired about foreign sesame seeds, and there are shipments from Hankou destined for delivery, so there is optimism. Yesterday, prices rose by 1.9 cents and 1.6 cents respectively.</p>
<h3>River Rice Transactions Extremely Scarce</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply from all dealers suddenly decreased, with only 4 shipments arriving (a total of over 900 piculs). However, the stock of Peiji rice was quite large, and retail sales were sluggish, so market sentiment did not strengthen. The market did not show any improvement. Early Japonica rice prices did not change. Only the Yantai dealers were handling Bo rice, and the market was also flat. The prices of Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan rice were similar to the previous day. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 18 or 19 ships arrived from the river region. Sales of all types of goods on the market were sluggish, with scarce transactions of high-quality white Japonica rice. Zhongjue rice continued to be sold, and the market stabilized for Zhongjue rice. Bo rice continued to arrive, and retail sales were still stagnant, with prices also slightly lower. Shipments of Shebu rice did not arrive, and sales were normal. Prices remained stable. Yin Yuan rice also remained stable, while sales of Bai Yuan rice were still acceptable, with prices slightly tighter. The prices of other goods were stable and peaceful.</p>
<h3>Suddenly, Shantou Dealers Inquire About Customers' Xian Rice</h3>
<p>The market relies on it to maintain its weakness.</p>
<p>Yesterday's customer Xian rice market saw continued sluggish sales. Sales for several days were limited to local street dealers. Customer groups have long lacked sales, and although production prices are high, holders are tight, and market prices are difficult to rise. Arrivals yesterday decreased, and local street sales were stagnant. The market seemed to be gradually declining, but suddenly Shantou dealers purchased 340 bags of Shahan brown rice, and inland dealers also purchased 150 bags of Siamese broken rice and rice wine, which kept the market afloat. Prices were similar to the boat market. Local street dealers purchased 300 bags of Wenzhou willow rice and over 1,000 bags of Gan Wan rice, with no significant price differences.</p>
<h3>Seafood: New Kelp Still Far Away</h3>
<p>Kelp Silk Prices Also Follow the Rise</p>
<p>Kelp: Due to the limited stock in the production area last year and the scarce supply in the Shanghai market, market prices have gradually increased. Currently, the price list is as follows: Tokachi kelp at 9.8 yuan, Nemuro, Hamanaka, Kawaji, Kunashiri, Atsuhishi, etc., at 9.2 yuan, Onishiso at 8.8 yuan, Shucho at 8.4 yuan, Cat Foot at 8 yuan, Select Foot at 7.8 yuan, Second Grade at 7.5 yuan, and Third Grade at 6 yuan. It is said that the goods arrive and are cleared immediately, with few remaining in stock. The new season is still three months away. If customer sales do not stop, the market is likely to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Kelp silk prices have risen due to the increased cost of raw materials, and sales prices have followed suit. High-quality goods in commercial buildings now cost no less than 1.02 yuan. Osaka goods, Double Dragon brand, are priced at 8.5 yuan, and Golden Dragon and Blue Dragon brands are priced at 7.67 yuan, but the goods are coarse and crude, and low quality is unbearable to look at.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was stable with a slight increase in customs gold, but transactions were limited and failed to translate into price increases. The association's list price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated sugar was 22 yuan, and for transit sugar, it was 6.95 yuan, with no changes. Dong Chi Bai sugar also lacked fluctuations. Only a few transactions of spot No. 8 Dong Bai sugar were made at 21.6 yuan, and No. 4 sugar was at 21.95 yuan. Ben Mian Bai sugar, recorded by Rao Ji, was at 20.6 yuan. According to records, the Chao sugar list price opened with over 300 bags of ordinary school red sugar at 12.7 yuan to 12.8 yuan, slightly reduced, with no other openings. Although there were rumors that Chaoqing sugar would be transformed into raw materials for coarse granulated white sugar, there was again disagreement yesterday. The transformation into white sugar is still difficult to realize.</p>
<p>The cooperative association's exchange period was again reached yesterday. The total fixed amount was 5,118 bags, and transactions increased slightly at the original price. No. 5 coarse white Guangzhou goods were sold at 21.85 yuan, selling 440 bags. Yangyang goods were sold at 21.65 yuan, selling 30 bags. No. 2 Five Sheep refined white sugar was sold at 21.1 yuan, selling 268 yuan. No. 4 fork was sold at 20.9 yuan, selling 72 bags.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Low-Grade Candied Dates Temporarily Scarce</h3>
<p>Low-grade candied dates have recently seen active purchases from Guangdong dealers, gradually depleting inventories, and prices have slightly tightened. Sales of high-grade goods are sluggish, with little fluctuation. Yesterday, the market price for high-grade Hui Gong bald-headed dates was 28 yuan, with standard surcharges and refunds for both high-grade and low-grade goods. It is said that Lanxi goods will arrive soon, and with the weather turning hot, goods that are soft and prone to deterioration will inevitably see changes in the market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Items: Lily Bulb Flakes Continue to Rise by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the market price of lily bulb flakes began to rise, sales have been continuous, leading to a supply shortage and extreme tightness. The current market price has risen again by 2 yuan, from 28 yuan to 30 yuan. Market inventories are extremely thin, and there may be a stockout soon. It is also reported that medicinal dealers are purchasing in the production area, and supplies are limited.</p>
<h3>Hardware: French Hesa Iron Spot Goods Sold Out</h3>
<p>French Hesa iron has recently seen a sudden stockout of spot goods on the market, resulting in buyers being unable to purchase and expressing regret. As a result, the standard price has gradually risen, with the market price reaching 36.5 yuan per case, an increase of over 1 yuan from before.</p>
<h3>Paper-Wrapped Iron Opens Higher Again</h3>
<p>The opening price for 200-pound paper-wrapped iron rose by another 2 yuan yesterday, selling for 24 yuan per case. Transactions with manufacturers were still limited. Due to few guarantees, customer dealers made few purchases. Spot goods in the hands of dealers are not numerous, and the arrival of new goods is scarce, so the market is quite firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Methods for Inspecting Tea Exports This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry has announced new methods for inspecting tea exports this year. The notice states:</p>
<p>"Our country's tea export trade has been declining year after year. Although there are many reasons for this decline, the lack of improvement in tea itself, and even adulteration, is one of the main reasons. For example, green tea is colored with toxic pigments such as San Yu Huang and Yi Ji Huang, which allows countries hostile to us to conduct anti-propaganda everywhere. Excessive moisture content often allows tea to naturally increase in weight and cannot maintain its original quality. Moreover, unsound packaging leads to damage rates of about 10% in foreign markets. Matters like these are fatal blows to China's foreign tea trade.</p>
<p>This bureau is responsible for inspection and must conduct thorough inspections of each batch of export tea. In other words, the main purpose of tea inspection is to improve the credibility of foreign trade and prevent the export of inferior tea and unsound packaging. Therefore, before the new tea season each year, the Ministry of Industry sets the minimum standards for export tea and announces matters that should be promoted and reformed as the criteria for daily inspection, and informs tea merchants to understand our regulations and produce tea conscientiously, so as not to be subject to export bans and other losses. This year's methods for tea inspection consist of three items. In order to enable tea merchants in various places to understand them in advance, the three regulations are written below:</p>
<p>A. Minimum Standards for Export Tea: 1. Green tea: The standard is Pingshui No. 2 Tea No. 7 Pearl Tea. Black tea: The standard is Hunan Juehong. Other teas: The standard is comparable color and palatable taste.</p>
<p>2. Tea moisture content: The standard is that it must not exceed 8.5%. However, this year, in addition to green tea based on the standard, black tea qualifies at 10.5%, and other teas qualify at 12%.</p>
<p>3. Tea ash content: The standard is that it must not exceed 7%. B. Cotton Methods for Colored Tea</p>
<p>1. When merchants report colored tea for inspection, they must fill in the name of the coloring material used in detail. If necessary, they may be ordered to submit the coloring material used for inspection.</p>
<p>2. Tea that is colored too heavily, or has the same or heavier coloring standards, is prohibited from export.</p>
<p>3. It is prohibited to export tea that uses toxic coloring materials containing metals such as lead, copper, arsenic, chromium, barium, etc. (such as the commonly used light yellow, San Yu Huang, Yi Ji Huang, and sand green), and other inorganic or organic toxic coloring materials.</p>
<p>Inner Box Silk Removal Method</p>
<p>The tea box for export tea must meet the following requirements; otherwise, it will be ordered to be repackaged before it can be exported.</p>
<p>1. Four wooden strips must be nailed to each of the four corners and upper and lower edges inside the box, for a total of twelve strips, to increase the supporting force of the tea box.</p>
<p>2. The inside wall of the lead foil must be properly lined with strong and clean paper to completely isolate the tea leaves from the foil.</p>
<p>3. The outside of the box must indicate the type of tea, trademark (general category), number of pieces, gross weight and net weight (new system), harvesting and production period, tea factory number and location.</p>
<p>The above three newly revised regulations will now be briefly explained. (1) The minimum standard for export tea is carefully determined by examining the situation of internal and external supply and demand. We hope that this minimum standard can be raised year by year, so that the quality of tea exported to foreign countries will improve year by year, so as to maintain the reputation of our Chinese tea for its quality and low price. However, in order to prevent the quality of inland tea from improving, the minimum standard for the past few years cannot be actively raised.</p>
<p>(2) The Moisture Content Standard for Tea: The harm of excessive moisture content in tea is that it easily loses its flavor and cannot be stored for a long time. We have already mentioned this. We have formulated this standard with reference to the tea moisture inspection regulations of various countries, and after many years of our own testing. The method of inspecting moisture content was previously done by baking in an oven. From this year onwards, a new Hoffman method will be adopted, and the results of the inspection will be more accurate. We will compile a separate instruction manual for this new method, so that inland tea merchants can also apply it themselves.</p>
<p>(3) Ash content inspection: Inspecting ash content is sufficient to understand the tea leaves that have been colored and adulterated, because the weight of pure tea will never exceed 7% after it is burned into ash. If it exceeds this, there is no doubt that the tea is impure. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Wu Jiang Fisherman</h3>
<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>It is said that in the past, King Ping of Chu ordered Fei Wuji to go to the state of Qin to find a concubine for his son, the crown prince "Jian." This concubine was exceptionally beautiful, and King Ping was so captivated that he took her for himself, and found another concubine for the crown prince Jian.</p>
<p>Fei Wuji was originally the junior tutor of Crown Prince Jian. Because of this, he gained the great favor of King Ping. However, Fei Wuji feared that Crown Prince Jian would kill him after ascending the throne, so he spoke ill of Crown Prince Jian in front of King Ping. King Ping was furious and ordered Fen Yang to go to Chengfu to kill Crown Prince Jian. However, Fen Yang released Crown Prince Jian, who fled to the state of Song.</p>
<p>Crown Prince Jian's senior tutor, Wu She, was a loyal minister. King Ping also arrested him and imprisoned him, ordering him to write letters to his two sons—Wu Shang and Wu Zixu—intending to eradicate the family. Wu Shang came, but Wu Zixu wanted to avenge his father and brother, and also fled to the state of Song to find Crown Prince Jian.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, a civil war broke out in the state of Song, and Crown Prince Jian could not stay there. He went to the state of Zheng with Wu Zixu, where he was treated well. Later, Crown Prince Jian went to the state of Jin. The state of Jin intended to use Crown Prince Jian as an inside agent to destroy the state of Zheng, and then give the state of Zheng to him. Crown Prince Jian was tempted, but Wu Zixu advised him against it, but he would not listen, and returned to the state of Zheng. Unfortunately, the news leaked out, and Duke Ding of Zheng and Zichan devised a plan to capture Crown Prince Jian and kill him. Wu Zixu protected Crown Prince Jian's son, Sheng, and fled from the state of Zheng, day and night, towards the state of Wu.</p>
<p>Wu Zixu protected the grandson Sheng and escaped from the state of Zheng, living like stray dogs and fish that slipped through the net. One day, they arrived at Zhaoguan, not far from the border between Wu and Chu. Wu Zixu thought that once he passed Zhaoguan, he would be saved. But King Ping of Chu had already offered a reward of fifty thousand shi of grain for his capture, and had posters with his likeness everywhere. How could he pass Zhaoguan!</p>
<p>Wu Zixu was extremely frightened and worried. His own life was not important, but the grandson Sheng was the blood of Crown Prince Jian. If anything happened to him, Crown Prince Jian's line would be cut off! What could he do?</p>
<p>Wu Zixu thought and thought, but could not find a solution. He had no choice but to find a place to stay in a remote area inside Zhaoguan. That night, Wu Zixu's beard turned white from worry.</p>
<p>The master of the house, Donggao Gong, was a chivalrous man. Knowing that Wu Zixu was wronged and harboring grievances, he tried his best to help him. He found someone with a similar build to go out of Zhaoguan together with him, to blend in. Fortunately, Wu Zixu's beard had already turned white, and he looked different from the picture. Taking advantage of the guards questioning others, he and grandson Sheng slipped through Zhaoguan.</p>
<p>Once Wu Zixu passed Zhaoguan, he wished he had wings to fly over the territory of Chu, so that he could save his life and take revenge. After walking for a while, he saw a vast expanse of white river in front of him. Once across the river, he would be in the territory of Wu. Wu Zixu was overjoyed.</p>
<p>But just as he was rejoicing, Wu Zixu heard shouts and the sound of horses' hooves behind him! Ah! The pursuers were coming! It turned out that the guards at Zhaoguan had found out soon after Wu Zixu had slipped through. They immediately pursued him. There was a great river in front of him, and pursuers behind him. There was no way to go to heaven, and no door to the earth. Wu Zixu was extremely anxious.</p>
<p>Wu Zixu protected grandson Sheng and ran to the riverbank. Ah! Not far from the opposite bank, wasn't there a fishing boat drifting by, with a long-bearded fisherman standing on the bow? Savior! Savior! Wu Zixu shouted loudly, "Old man, ferry me across! Old man, ferry me across!"</p>
<p>This fisherman was also a chivalrous man, unwilling to make a living in the bustling world. He only fished on this riverbank, living a leisurely life. He had seen Wu Zixu's likeness at Zhaoguan. Although Wu Zixu's beard had turned white, he still recognized him. He also saw that Wu Zixu was carrying a child with a broad forehead and full cheeks on his back, knowing that he was a noble. Because Wu Zixu was wronged and harboring grievances, the fisherman was moved to act chivalrously and wanted to ferry him across. But he saw the banners from afar, and was afraid that if he ferried him across like this, the pursuers would see him. That would be troublesome, so he sang a song:</p>
<p>"The sun and moon shine, yet time has passed,</p>
<p>I agreed to meet you at the reeds."</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard this and knew what the fisherman meant. He carried grandson Sheng, disregarding the mud under his feet, parted the reeds, and walked to the edge of the river, where he hid, waiting.</p>
<p>Before long, Wu Zixu heard the sound of horses' hooves, and the shouts had reached the riverbank. The fisherman's boat had not yet come over, frightening him and making him anxious. He didn't dare to breathe, and didn't dare to move, for fear that the tips of the reeds would move and be seen by the pursuers.</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard the pursuers shouting loudly, "Old man, have you seen anyone come here?"</p>
<p>He heard the fisherman answer, "No."</p>
<p>The pursuers shouted again, "Old man, if you lie, we'll make you regret it!"</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard the sound of horses' hooves and the shouts go along the riverbank to the right, gradually fading away. Only then did he put down the stone in his heart, exhale a long breath, and think to himself, "This old man is really a good person, saving the lives of me and my lord!"</p>
<p>The fisherman sang again outside:</p>
<p>"The sun has set,</p>
<p>My heart is sad.</p>
<p>The moon is late,</p>
<p>Why not ferry me across?</p>
<p>Things are urgent, what shall I do?"</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard the song and came out of the reeds to the water's edge. The fisherman's boat was indeed docked there. Wu Zixu carried grandson Sheng and jumped onto the fishing boat. The fisherman moved the oar, and the boat left the shore, heading towards the center of the river.</p>
<p>In the vast expanse of the river, this fishing boat was like a leaf. The fisherman only steered the boat, not talking to Wu Zixu, nor looking at Wu Zixu. Wu Zixu's heart was much calmer than when he was on the shore. Sitting in the boat, the fisherman didn't speak, so he didn't speak either. He just stared blankly at the fisherman's arms moving back and forth, rowing the oar.</p>
<p>In just two or three hours, they reached the opposite bank, which was the territory of Wu. Wu Zixu carried grandson Sheng ashore. The fisherman secured the boat and also went ashore. Wu Zixu was about to thank him, but the fisherman said, "General seems hungry, I'll fetch some food."</p>
<p>Wu Zixu saw this and became suspicious, thinking, "The old man left in such a hurry, could it be that he's going to call people to capture me? But if he wanted to capture me, he could have done so on the other bank, where there were also pursuers. Why would he ferry me and my lord across the river? That can't be. But the old man's actions are really suspicious. I'd better hide for a while."</p>
<p>So, Wu Zixu pulled grandson Sheng and hid in the reeds by the river again.</p>
<p>After a while, the fisherman came with wheat rice and fish soup, but couldn't find Wu Zixu on the riverbank, knowing that he was suspicious of him. There was nowhere to hide on the riverbank except for the reeds, so he knew that Wu Zixu must be hiding in the reeds. He sang a song:</p>
<p>"Man in the reeds!</p>
<p>Man in the reeds!</p>
<p>Aren't you a poor scholar?"</p>
<p>Wu Zixu heard that it was still just the fisherman alone, so he led grandson Sheng out. Seeing the fisherman holding food in his hands, he took it with both hands and sat on the riverbank with grandson Sheng to eat.</p>
<p>Wu Zixu was very grateful to the fisherman, so he took off the sword he wore on his waist, handed it to the fisherman with both hands, and said, "Thank you, old man, for saving the lives of me and my lord. I don't have any gold or jewels with me, so I'll give you this sword for self-defense, as a token of my appreciation."</p>
<p>The fisherman did not take the sword, and smiled, "General Wu, I respect you as a hero, and you are wronged and harbor grievances, so I saved you. The King of Chu offered a reward of fifty thousand shi of grain for your capture, but I don't want it. Would I want your sword? General Wu, don't underestimate me!"</p>
<p>Wu Zixu had no choice but to ask, "Please tell me your name, so that I can repay your kindness in the future."</p>
<p>The fisherman did not answer. Wu Zixu had no choice but to bid farewell to the fisherman, and said, "Old man, please don't tell anyone!"</p>
<p>The fisherman bit his lip, stared at Wu Zixu for a long time, and then said, "General Wu, go. I won't reveal it even if I die."</p>
<p>Wu Zixu and grandson Sheng had walked less than twenty steps when they heard the fisherman shout loudly from behind, "What's the point of a great man not being trustworthy? General Wu, rest assured, the state of Chu will never know that you have gone to the state of Wu."</p>
<p>Wu Zixu was shocked. He turned around and saw the fisherman with both hands pointing to the sky, stepping on one side of the boat's gunwale with his foot. With just one step, the boat overturned, covering the fisherman underneath. A rush of water came, washing away the boat and the man. Unconsciously, he looked at the great river, and cried and kowtowed on the ground, saying, "Me and my lord have received great kindness from you, old man. We cannot repay it, but because of my words, you lost your life. Even if I, Wu Zixu, die ten thousand times, I cannot repay you."</p>
<p>After Wu Zixu finished kowtowing, he led grandson Sheng to the state of Wu.</p>
<h3>Joseph Lister (1827-1912)</h3>
<p>— Zheng Kan</p>
<p>Joseph Lister was a native of West Ham, England. His father was the inventor of the high-magnification microscope. From an early age, his father supervised him strictly, and he learned to use the microscope very early, and understood the necessity of detailed observation and accurate recording.</p>
<p>Lister was a responsible and enthusiastic young man. He didn't make friends easily, but once he got along with someone, he could treat them with sincerity. He admired and thanked his father very much, and vowed to use the tool invented by his father to do something great. He often prayed silently to the microscope, saying, "Friend, I will definitely work hard, please help me succeed! Otherwise, I will not only fail my father, but also fail others."</p>
<p>Under the microscope, he looked at clear water and dirty water, and saw many active little things: some like mosquito larvae, wriggling at both ends, some like tadpoles, swimming everywhere. He was very interested in these little things, and decided to study them thoroughly. He told his father that he wanted to go to medical school to study bacteria. At the age of twenty-five, he received a degree in medicine from the University of London. Because of his excellent grades, William Sharpey, the famous authority on physiology at the time, hired him as his surgical assistant at the hospital of the University College.</p>
<p>At that time, Pasteur had just invented the germ theory, proving that germs came from outside, not from dead matter and air, reminding people to be wary of the invasion of germs. Unfortunately, most surgeons at the time were stubborn and superstitious in the "spontaneous generation theory." Some even closed their eyes and didn't even look at the microscope, blindly guessing that the reason why wounds festered was because the oxygen in the air fermented in the wound. When surgeons went to the ward to perform surgery, they not only didn't wash their hands or disinfect their instruments, but they deliberately chose to wear dirty clothes. Because the ward was too dirty, clean clothes would be stained by it. He said, "Why wash your hands, they'll get dirty when you perform surgery; why disinfect instruments, they're always in contact with poison." Germs were allowed to spread everywhere without people realizing it. Patients infected each other, the wards were filthy, and everything could be a medium for spreading germs. Therefore, even patients with minor injuries who were hospitalized would develop severe poisoning. A kind of "hospital gangrene" was prevalent in the hospital, and nineteen out of ten patients died from this disease.</p>
<p>At that time, the common treatment for wounds was to first use anesthetic to make the patient unconscious, and then use strong medicine to burn off the gangrenous flesh. When the patient woke up, he found that the new wound was even worse than the old wound, and he was always complaining. Often after a few days, a gray membrane appeared around the wound, becoming an incurable disease, and they would die sooner or later. But this kind of treatment could sometimes cure patients. Patients took the risk of being treated, which was better than waiting to die from "hospital gangrene."</p>
<p>As soon as Lister became a surgical assistant, he noticed this cauterizing treatment. He thought, "How can wounds be healed by burning? It must be that the disease-causing roots in the wound have been burned off. What are these disease-causing roots? If I can find them and come up with a foolproof method to eliminate or isolate them, wouldn't this be a great invention to benefit mankind?" So he examined the diseased, rotten flesh under the microscope, and found that there were active microorganisms in it. He assumed that these active things were the disease-causing roots, but because the evidence was insufficient, he dared not draw a conclusion. Not long after, Sharpey introduced Lister to James Syme, one of the most famous surgeons at the time. Syme talked with him and knew that he was a shrewd and resolute young man, so he kept him as a surgical assistant at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, giving him all the conveniences for research.</p>
<p>Lister was very compassionate by nature. He worked in the ward and felt very uncomfortable seeing that most of the patients died from "hospital gangrene," so he looked for ways to save them. He had read all kinds of scientific books, but couldn't find any reason. Finally, he read Pasteur's paper and saw the germ theory invented by Pasteur. He was very surprised and delighted, and exclaimed, "I have the answer, there is a way to save hospital gangrene." He had already assumed that wound festering was caused by germs, and with Pasteur's theory and proof, he knew that his assumption was the truth.</p>
<p>But just knowing that there were germs and not finding a way to eliminate them, Lister still couldn't think of a way to deal with them. He racked his brains to think of a way. How to kill the germs in the wound and prevent the invasion of external germs was now his most serious problem. He experimented for several months, all to no avail, and felt very depressed and anxious. He kept asking himself, "Am I just going to be helpless, and not be able to invent a sterilizing drug?"</p>
<p>One morning, his mind was very clear, and he thought calmly, "What's the use of being anxious? Only a calm mind can do research, otherwise even if there is a great truth in front of you, you won't be able to grasp it." He looked up and saw the sky was clear and boundless, and three or five birds were flying freely in the sky. He suddenly felt something, stretched out his neck and looked far away, saying, "The suburbs must be even more spectacular, why don't I go out and play for a day. Maybe I'm too tired, a tired horse can't even compare to a donkey. Maybe if I rest for a day today, I'll be able to invent a sterilizing thing tomorrow." So he immediately prepared to travel to the suburbs.</p>
<p>Although he said that, he still couldn't forget his work. After only half a day of playing, he ran back. When he got home, he saw his gardener cleaning the ditch, pouring carbolic acid into the ditch to eliminate the odor. He suddenly thought of a reason. He thought, "Carbolic acid can eliminate odors, it must be that it can kill the microorganisms that make the water smell bad. Why don't I try using it as an antiseptic to kill germs."</p>
<p>His first experiment with his antiseptic was a great success. Just then, a child was run over by a carriage, and the broken bone had pierced through the skin of his leg and protruded out. Lister wrapped it with cloth soaked in carbolic acid, and properly reattached the broken bone. As a result, the child's leg did not fester or become infected with hospital gangrene, and he soon recovered. This was an unprecedented miracle. Later, he used his antiseptic to cure many people, and hospital gangrene never occurred in the wards he managed. Syme saw Lister's great invention for the medical community, and was very satisfied, so he recommended him to replace himself as a professor of surgery at the University of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>When Lister first used carbolic acid as an antiseptic, his colleagues strongly attacked him, saying that he was "a crow dressed as a peacock." Later, they saw that Lister's method was indeed effective, and they had to use it and admire him. Lister was not satisfied with this, and continued to work hard to study antiseptics. After years of research and improvement, he eventually produced the most perfect antiseptics today, double-declined zinc and declined mercury ointment.</p>
<p>On Pasteur's fiftieth birthday, scientists from all over the world came to Paris to celebrate his birthday, and Lister also went to congratulate him. Pasteur saw Lister and was so happy that he forgot himself. He hugged Lister in the midst of the cheers of the crowd, with tears of emotion in his eyes, his lips murmuring, as if to say, "You and I are one person. My invention is yours, and your invention is mine."</p>
<p>Publishing Industry</p>
<h3>A Discussion of Children's Books</h3>
<p>— Zhou Hanmei</p>
<p>Chinese children are the most lacking in education, I think that statement is probably not too excessive, right? Children in cities haven't learned to recognize many "human, horse, cow, sheep," but they can rattle off the mahjong tiles of "zhong, fa, bai"; children in the countryside live in muddy ditches all day long, and there is no talk of education at all. This is from a regional perspective; as for the difference between rich and poor? Then the children of poor families have no opportunity to receive education at all, while the children of wealthy families are buried alive in the arms of their parents' doting. Saying that Chinese children are lacking in education is perhaps still giving twelve points of leeway.</p>
<p>Relatively speaking, those who can receive some education are naturally the families of intellectuals. Under the guidance of wise parents, they always want to choose some beneficial children's books for them to read. In my opinion, children's books in the Chinese publishing industry are still built on this kind of family.</p>
<p>How can all Chinese children receive proper education? Although this question is quite closely linked to children's books, it is not within the scope of this article. Now I want to make some criticisms and contributions to the existing children's books.</p>
<p>The times do not allow us to proceed step by step, everything needs to move forward by leaps and bounds, so how can children's books be an exception? If ordinary children's books still talk about fairy tales, the dialogues of Brother Cow and Brother Horse in this extraordinary period, it would be creating a secluded paradise for children in heaven, rather than in the human world of the Republic of China in the present time and place. Therefore, in my opinion, the first principle of compiling modern children's books should be to cater to the psychology and physiology of children, and compile various books for children to read during extraordinary periods. For example, "The Story of Airplanes," "Children During Wartime," "Dad Put on His Military Uniform," etc., are all excellent topics for children's books. We should compile the common sense of wartime into various interesting stories. I believe that in terms of children's interest, it may be much better than the topics of fairies and Sister Moon! You must know that children's curiosity is certainly abundant, but the reality of the story is more important. Do we still think that the story of fairies can win children's cheers more than the planes soaring in the sky? At the same time, some children's books are best linked to toys, such as the method of making airplanes, etc., which will definitely make children feel more interested. Secondly, the local nature should be taken into consideration when compiling children's books. The current children's books and textbooks in elementary schools all suffer from the same problem, that is, the editor lives in the city, and what he sees is everything in the city, so the topics compiled also pertain to the various things in the city. Therefore, the book can still be applied in the city, but the children in the countryside are confused. Given the breadth of China's territory and the great difference in the level of culture, the needs of various places are of course also very different. Therefore, it is of course impossible to compile a children's book that all children across the country can read, understand, and enjoy reading. Therefore, the second principle of compiling children's books should take into account the different local characteristics of various places. Thirdly, there is the issue of price. I think that a big reason why children's books cannot be popularized and why Chinese children lack education is that the price of books is too high. A children's book often costs a dime of silver, which in the families of Chinese children with weak purchasing power, they have to reluctantly give up. Therefore, most of the current children's books are sold in the libraries of elementary schools across the country, and children rarely subscribe directly. This is a very heavy blow to both the Chinese publishing industry and Chinese children. Therefore, I believe that the third principle of publishing children's books is to reduce the price as much as possible and adopt the principle of small profits and quick sales.</p>
<p>This generation of Chinese children is struggling in a difficult fate. We adults who have the duty of educating children should create more benefits for them!</p>
<h3>"Reading Problems of Chinese Production Education" (II)</h3>
<p>— Baisha</p>
<p>A. Economic View—Regarding production education as education that cultivates economic production.</p>
<p>B. Social View—Regarding production education as a type of education that develops social production.</p>
<p>C. Vocational Education View—Regarding production education as the embodiment of vocational education, or a part of it.</p>
<p>D. Humanistic Education View—Regarding production education as education for training a "productive personality."</p>
<p>E. Labor Education View—Regarding production education as equivalent to labor education, or a part of it.</p>
<p>F. Science Education View—Regarding production education as simply science education.</p>
<p>As for its objectives, summarized, we can obtain three: 1. Understanding the significance of social production; 2. Training in the techniques of social production; 3. Cultivating the personality for social production.</p>
<p>Chapter Four covers the conditions for implementing production education, categorized into internal and external conditions. The former requires resisting international aggression, eliminating feudal forces, stabilizing social order, unifying political authority, solidifying economic construction, and transforming social psychology. The latter requires reforming the education system, cultivating guiding talent, raising implementation funds, and procuring production equipment. If these conditions are not met, production education can be implemented reluctantly, but it will not achieve good results.</p>
<p>Chapter Five covers the principles for implementing production education: 1. It should not be merely reckless action and experimentation, but comprehensive planning. 2. It should not be mere imitation but should adapt to local conditions. 3. It should not focus solely on production results but should also align with educational principles. 4. It should not waste production but must conform to economic principles. 5. Production education should not be implemented away from production; it should be implemented at the production site. 6. Production education should not be theoretical but must be implemented in production activities.</p>
<p>Chapter Six covers the implementation of production education in various regions. First, it describes the implementing agencies. Although various educational institutions have implementations similar to production education, most are rural improvement agencies; primary and secondary schools are mostly attached to labor courses. Next, it describes production education activities, which can generally be divided into agronomy, animal husbandry, and craftsmanship. Then, it describes the implementation methods: social education agencies focus on exhibitions, publicity, and demonstrations; multilevel schools focus on education-related practice and design. As for guiding personnel and implementation funds, one only sees the qualifications are a mixed bag, and the amount of funding varies widely. Therefore, to achieve perfect production education, one must follow the six principles outlined in Chapter Four.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven is the conclusion, first summarizing each chapter and then stating the book's recommendations.</p>
<p>After reading this book, we can gain a clear overview of the theory and implementation of production education, because it melts the theory and practice of production education into one furnace. We can gain an outline of the implementation situation in various places.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, there is a brief conclusion, allowing readers to grasp the outline after reading, to understand the essence of the book, and avoid superficial understanding. If readers are limited by time and cannot read the entire book, then reading the conclusion of each chapter and the conclusion of the entire book can obtain its essence.</p>
<p>The meaning of each section in the book, if not written by the author, is annotated with its source. If readers want to know more details, they can browse the original book, avoiding the pain of searching everywhere.</p>
<p>Appendix One is the implementation status of production education in various countries, detailing the recent implementation status in Russia, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Japan, which can not only be used as a reference but also as a lesson. The merit of "stones from other mountains can be used to polish jade" can also fulfill some obligation!</p>
<p>The appendix also has a bibliography of papers and a bibliography of monographs, almost completely searching for papers on the theory and implementation of production education. Those who study production education can view its index and have no need to search for materials everywhere, feeling the pain of lack.</p>
<p>Although the writing of this book came from the hands of various experts, the fluency of the text, the uniformity of the organization, and the clear outline of the materials are all as if from one person's hand, which also shows the value of this book. (End)</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Crime and Economic Problems</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Facts tell us that the occurrence of criminal cases in society is mostly related to the economy. Especially under the current deformed social organization, economic problems are the main factor causing criminal behavior. Chairman Lin reported in the Kuomintang Memorial Weekly: Upon reviewing the statistical table of recent inmates submitted by the Judicial Yuan, the total number of male and female criminals is 60,745, and the crimes listed can be divided into four categories: The first category is crimes related to robbery, with 31,309 criminals; the second category is assault and injury crimes, with 9,369 criminals; the third category is crimes against public morals and marriage, with 3,572 criminals; the fourth category is opium and morphine crimes, with 7,594 criminals; in addition, there are 2,111 criminals endangering the Republic of China and committing internal rebellion; the rest belong to other various crimes. From this statistical table, we can see that among the 60,000-plus inmates in various provinces, more than 30,000, whose crimes are directly caused by the economy, account for one-half of the total number of criminals. Although the names of the remaining second, third, and fourth categories of crimes may be assault, injury, marriage, or morphine, if we trace the cause of their crimes, they are also indirectly related to economic problems. This is a major issue worthy of our attention!</p>
<p>Human life cannot escape being dominated by the economy, and clothing, food, and shelter are three indispensable necessities of life. Precisely because of this, when a person encounters difficulties in life, in order to satisfy the desire for survival, they often take risks and engage in criminal activities. This is the origin of most criminal events in society. Every day we open the newspaper and see news of theft, robbery, kidnapping, etc., almost without a day passing by. This is still what has been discovered, and there are already so many. The number of cases that have not been investigated is even more imaginable. In recent years, with the collapse of rural areas, the decline of industry and commerce, and the entire economy in extreme panic, the number of crimes committed in society due to the pressure of livelihood is endless. According to Chairman Lin's report, compared with the same statistics in 1931, the number of robbers and pirates in 1931 was more than 2,500, while the number of similar crimes recently is more than 14,500, an increase of about six times. The number of people who violated the regulations for punishing bandits in 1931 was 600, while recently there are more than 5,000, an increase of about eight times. How serious is this phenomenon! This clearly illustrates the increasingly difficult livelihood of the people!</p>
<p>Faced with the fact that the number of criminal cases in China is accelerating, what methods should we use to deal with it? This is a question that must be considered. What the authorities can do is only to implement legal sanctions. However, can today's criminal events be eliminated by punishment? Lao Tzu said: "The more laws are promulgated, the more thieves there are." An effective method is still to find a way out for the hungry! Because this is the only way to relieve the pain of living under oppression. Therefore, passive legal sanctions cannot prevent the occurrence of criminal behavior.</p>
<h3>Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Lao Xin</p>
<p>—The Story of Sea Navigation—</p>
<p>As usual, when the cargo ship passes through Dali Xu, if Third Master gives the go-ahead to rest for one night, we can all go home together. I don't know why, as soon as the ship enters the canal, my heart starts to itch, as if I can't rest easy until we dock. Old Seven is even crazier. At this time, he's usually like an ant on a hot pot, jumping around with no energy at all.</p>
<p>This time, after unloading the cargo at Dali Xu, it was almost sunset. Everyone was panting and eager and tired. Only after Third Master rolled up his pants and went to a "tiger-fighting" place in the market to smoke opium did we jump back on the boat and start singing our way home. Old Seven was the first to get excited. He taught us:</p>
<p>"Return to the ship before dawn tomorrow, you idiots. A little later means a little more fun!"</p>
<p>Old Gui has always looked down on him, and Old Gui is actually a little afraid of going home—as soon as he gets home, his yellow-faced wife will start nagging, either asking for money or asking if he brought back sangjisheng from Wuzhou. Bring your ancestors for eighteen generations, sangjisheng? He couldn't even bring back a twig.</p>
<p>It was almost dinner time when we reached the entrance of Da Zhen Village. We split up: Old Gui turned left towards the majestic Runan Ancestral Hall, and Old Seven and I walked into the small door on the right hand in hand. Before we had gone far, the children saw us and rushed out laughing. Seventh Sister-in-law is a very strong woman. When Old Seven is not at home, she also farms five acres of land with her nephews. All year round, she works hard "under the sunny sky, getting soaked in the rain". But sometimes she has a very bad temper, loves to scold people, and loves to gossip. The people in our Dafu Lane all say she is a "street scolder".</p>
<p>I patted Old Seven on the shoulder and walked into my own house. My old mother was cooking, and my younger sister and older sister were embroidering. Besides weaving cloth and picking firecrackers to earn some money, they depended on me—but speaking of me, only Heaven knows.</p>
<p>"Hai, you're back?" It seemed unexpected, and she was strangely affectionate. My mother called me from the lower room. I responded as usual. After that, she instructed my sister: "Pour tea for your brother, your brother has worked hard..." In this way, she was busy preparing dinner again.</p>
<p>I was terribly tired, and my knees hurt as if someone had hit them hard. I flopped down on the kang, and my sister interestingly showed me a picture she had drawn from a cigarette pack. At this time, I felt very sad. I casually counted the money left over from Wuzhou in my pocket—two double dimes and seventeen copper cents. I was vaguely thinking, I don't know what I was thinking about...</p>
<p>"Hai, dinner's ready."</p>
<p>I ate mechanically. Suddenly, Seventh Sister-in-law's "street scolder" ghost-like voice came from the front of the street—"You good-for-nothing, I tell you to bring money home to support the family, or we'll all starve to death! You go out for a month and a half, sailing on a boat, and you don't bring a few small coins home. You still have the nerve to come back. If it were me, I would have jumped into the Bai'e pool and died. ... You say you'll wait for the next time, don't wait until your grandson grows up to get rich, no one believes your words! ... Sailing on those cursed boats, you're sure to risk your life, but if you want to make money, you really have to be reincarnated! You good-for-nothing, you cursed wretch, go to hell!"</p>
<p>My mother sighed. My sister's pale face gently lifted up, and her lifeless eyes stared blankly at me. I felt a little dizzy, and I felt as painful as if I had been stabbed with an awl. I couldn't swallow the rice that my mother, sister, and younger sister exchanged for with their blood. I walked to the bed, lay down, and fell into a deep sleep. I heard my sister saying:</p>
<p>"He's too tired, look at him..."</p>
<p>Very fuzzy, I didn't want to listen anymore, my mind was filled with one tragic scene after another, my body was burning, I had many nightmares, and when I woke up, it was not yet dawn, my head was still heavy and throbbing. When I went to the lower room to water and wash my face, I saw through the window that my mother was sitting by the bed, wearing her reading glasses, mending my younger sister's torn shoes. I don't know why, but I walked into my mother's room, my younger sister was still sleeping soundly, but my older sister had already gotten up early to embroider.</p>
<p>"Hai, are you feeling better? You were constantly talking in your sleep last night."</p>
<p>The loving words pierced me like arrows. I took the remaining money from my pocket and put it on my mother's bedside without looking back, and said with difficulty:</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm going!..."</p>
<p>By the time I ran back to the boat, the sun had just risen from the water.</p>
<h3>Tongzi</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>It was past six o'clock, and the sun was still hanging high on the corner of the mountain. The fields on the mountainside were bathed in the evening glow. The neat rows and the strong ears of grain had a peaceful and tranquil demeanor, like a beauty falling asleep!</p>
<p>When we arrived at the new station, we rested at Li's Inn. The inns in this place don't have any names. No, not to mention that it was the border of Guizhou, since we set out on the road, only a very small number of the inns we stayed in in any town were able to have a name. For the porters, they knew it by heart, what places ×'s store was, how many rooms it had, what the price was, and what kind of person the boss was, all clearly engraved in their hearts.</p>
<p>Although the new station was not big, it had two big inns, Li's Inn and Wang's Inn.</p>
<p>Really, on the mountain road, the porters' predictions are admirable. They can calculate how far they can walk that day and where they must rest at night. Other things, like where to have breakfast, where there is a tea pavilion, where the road is easy to walk, and where it is more dangerous, are all like a family letter, all stored in their stomachs.</p>
<p>The morning of departure was on a brisk and gentle day.</p>
<p>At Mentouqing, it was estimated that we had walked half of the day's journey. Good, let's not bring the leftover vegetable scraps into the mountain city. Tonight, no matter what, we'll be able to feed our small, shriveled stomachs something. So, we took out the salted vegetables and a little chili sauce that we had fried in the lunch box. We didn't cherish them as much as we used to, and in the blink of an eye, they were all sent down our throats.</p>
<p>After crossing Chumi Shop, we had a different feeling in our hearts. Thinking that in a few hours we would leave this difficult journey and begin to come into contact with the ancient city, how could we not be pleasantly surprised? New expectations and new explorations will all be displayed before our eyes. Good, let's wait for the facts to unfold! Here, we sang out-of-tune Peking operas, drums, ditties, and ballads. The sedan chair moved slowly, and the passing guests stared at these strange movements with wide eyes.</p>
<p>——Sir, what kind of opera are you singing?</p>
<p>——Nine tunes and eighteen styles, we have them all.</p>
<p>——This is really rare to hear, he smiles unnaturally: We don't have these things in small places!</p>
<p>We admitted that it was not a lie. Growing up in the mountains in their short lives, how could they hear some foreign provincial scraps?</p>
<h3>Promote Disinfection Movement to Eliminate Humanity's Great Enemy</h3>
<p>— Radical</p>
<p>There are countless infectious bacteria, either scattered in the polluted air or left on unclean food. Because the bacteria are so small that human eyes cannot see them, they can invade the human body at any time, causing death!</p>
<p>Tiny germs can kill tens of millions of people every year. Please quickly unite to eliminate humanity's great enemy. Then you must use the only weapon to kill germs and sterilize, "A Lin Sha Er" (produced by the Wuzhou Pharmacy).</p>
<p>The main ingredient of "A Lin Sha Er," "Ke Li Sha Er," is rich in bactericidal and disinfectant properties. Whether for daily bathing or hand washing, it cannot be without. If there are skin diseases and sores, etc., it will be effective immediately after use. In order to seek human health, we can only promote the disinfection movement.</p>
<h3>Everlasting Fame</h3>
<p>— Adoration</p>
<p>The film "Everlasting Fame," now showing at a certain theater, depicts the story of a great man in the scientific community who devoted his life to inventing medical skills to benefit mankind.</p>
<p>From this story, I thought of gonorrhea. Gonorrhea still does not have an effective treatment to this day. Although there are drugs for treating gonorrhea on the market that boast and lure with big words such as "Invented by Dr. ××, effective in a few hours, root treatment in one box...", this is nothing more than inferior drugs speculating, which really violates the morality of medicine.</p>
<p>Since the new drug "Dili Ping" was born, it has not been publicized in any way, but it has actually achieved great success, because it can gradually achieve full recovery with its effectiveness in diuresis, pain relief, sterilization, and clearing turbidity.</p>
<p>"Dili Ping" has a place in the history of gonorrhea treatment, and it has its own value of everlasting fame.</p>
<p>("Dili Ping"—Distributed by Wuzhou Pharmacy)</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>In the evening, we saw the city of Tongzi County, built against the mountain, winding like a snake. The gray-black city walls would not be much different from my hometown, I guessed.</p>
<p>After entering the city, we unloaded our luggage at some inn, and after counting the beads of the abacus, the wages due to the porters were handed over to the foreman. Naturally, there were also some rewards. They left without caring about their lives after today.</p>
<p>After dinner, we inventoried all the items and moved to the Yibin Hostel near the center.</p>
<p>After nine o'clock, Old Zhangtou came here with his inseparable crutch, asking to take our long-distance bus to advance to the province in order to reduce his expenses. Tonight, he was a good talker. He told us many stories about Tongzi, and also talked about many unrelated trivial matters. He didn't leave until eleven o'clock.</p>
<p>Get up early tomorrow and take a stroll around the entire city! I have such a private wish.</p>
<h3>Odds and Ends of Tokyo</h3>
<p>— Lei Shiyu</p>
<p>(2) Grilled Birds, A Ding, Grilled Clams</p>
<p>As soon as dusk falls, some streets suddenly have structures that look like camps, with canvas reflecting a hazy light. When you get closer, a savory smell wafts out, and the entrance is hung with a few strips of cloth with the rough characters "Grilled Birds" written on them. Don't step past it just because it's too cheap. There are good things to taste inside!</p>
<p>On the table is a tin plate or something holding skewers of pig liver, pig stomach, and so-called "grilled birds," sparrows that have been slaughtered cleanly and naked. There is also a bottle of Japanese sake, mustard sauce, soy sauce, or something else.</p>
<p>You can choose what you like to eat. Liver and stomach cost one or two cents (ten cents in Japanese currency equals a dime) per skewer, and a small bird costs three cents or more. The owner inside, sometimes a couple, sometimes just a woman or a man, listens to your instructions and puts the skewers on the blazing charcoal stove, filling the iron bars one by one to grill. While fanning the charcoal fire, they flip the skewers. When they think it's cooked enough, they pick it up and dip it in a soy sauce vat. You can take it and chew on it while standing.</p>
<p>What does it taste like? That depends on each person's taste, but I think that using the money for one visit to a coffee shop to eat this kind of thing for a month is very economical and guarantees a filling effect. It is said that "grilled birds" are famous and characteristic of Japanese food.</p>
<p>But some don't necessarily set up a tent on the street to do business. They can open a stall in their own small house, as long as they also hang a few strips of cloth with the two characters "grilled birds" written on them at the door.</p>
<p>Because I quite like to eat this kind of thing, I know quite a few such places. But I think the best-tasting one is in Dingqiao District, Suwa Town. I can't remember the name, but it's easy to find because his portrait is hanging on his doorway. The portrait is very similar and distinctive. A man in his forties or fifties has such a long Guan Gong beard: thick, shiny black beards, five or six inches long, from the roots of both ears to his chin. According to him, he did business in Taiwan for many years. He often used one or two Chinese words to express his humor.</p>
<p>Because I only "patronized" a few times on the occasion of visiting friends, but his eyes seemed to have a special congenital structure, and the second time he would ask about the previous time.</p>
<p>"A Ding" shops, like his "grilled bird" shops, mostly demarcate the main hall of their own home to do this kind of business. The difference is that the cloth curtain is written in letters, and the food inside has a different flavor. The food is these things: radish, tofu, eggs,... mixed in a pot and cooked. If you like something, she will clamp it up and put it on a plate for you to eat. There is also cheap wine there, whether you drink it or not is up to you. Some even have stools for you to sit on, which is even more comfortable.</p>
<p>When I lived in Kanda District, I found such a comfortable one. And the old woman's house had two daughters, who were very affectionate in their reception. Especially the eldest daughter almost always played the "shamisen" for us to listen to, and sometimes hummed a few tunes.</p>
<p>As for the price of the food: each piece of radish and tofu is about two or three cents, and an egg is five cents. This doesn't seem very proletarian.</p>
<p>"Grilled Clams" are things like mussels, clams, and snails. The method is the same as "grilled birds," but there is no need to flip them because the shell is opened and placed there to fry until it is done. The price is not cheaper than "A Ding." A clam costs about three cents, and mussels and snails cost five, ten, or fifteen cents, depending on the size. But its taste is better than the first two. This, of course, depends on one's own taste.</p>

<p>Opening "Phoenix Hairpin"</p>
<p>The most amorous are often the most foolish. Ill-fated beauties have existed since ancient times. I, Hui Xian, lost my parents in childhood and had no support. I was a lonely adopted daughter in Lu Dou. The engagement with my cousin was originally righteous. The family spent happy times together. Even more joyful was my cousin's deep affection. Murmuring sweet words of tenderness. I only hate that the nun, Bukong, coveted widowhood. I only regret that gentle words of remonstrance deepened the enmity. The Phoenix Hairpin, broken, was not intentional. It stirred up extraordinary misfortune. The manipulation was merely for revenge. The most hateful people in the world are nuns. Slanderous words were used to harm the maidservant. I endured countless hardships and grievances. My aunt's anger did not subside, and her heart changed even more. She actually made me live alone in the temple and suffer bullying. The evil nun once tempted me to a vile profession. I vowed to uphold my chastity. How could my beloved know that he went far away to take the exam? A myriad of sorrows, to whom can I confide? Although my love returned and we were fortunate to meet, it only increased my sadness. The lotus flowers blooming on the same stalk are difficult to achieve. Alas, I, given the task of writing a heartbreaking poem, how can I bear to read it? Alas, my teardrops fall</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>on my silk collar. Alas, I, thinking back and forth, find it hard to dream. Alas, I, tossing and turning all night, cannot sleep. Alas, I, my haggard face, am afraid to face the mirror. Alas, I, lingering in bed, have truly fallen ill. Alas, our ephemera-like marriage is just a fleeting illusion. Alas, I, suppressing my tears and grief, advise my beloved. Alas, I, frequently remember the Lu family's ancestors. Alas, the Kun string should be continued, I repeatedly urge. Alas, I, revived from near death, am called by my mother-in-law. I cannot attend to her morning and evening. I wish to temporarily ease my worried brow. You must forgive your daughter-in-law for her unfilial name. I sigh that my sinful fate was predetermined in a past life. Why bother blaming others for the torment? I only hope that Heaven knows my heart. The gatherings and separations in life are like duckweed. I willingly close my eyes and go to the netherworld.</p>
<p>Xu Wenbi's Opening</p>
<p>Hangye (1180) 11:15 AM to 12:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Filial Son"</p>
<p>Parents love their son like gold. They protect him in every way with utmost diligence. They hold him in their arms at all times. They are anxious and uneasy. They fear their son is too full or hungry. They worry even more about him being too cold or warm. If the child falls ill, they wish they could take his place. It's like a knife cutting through their heart, causing immense pain. Delicious food and fruit are given to the child first. Leftover rice and scraps are swallowed by the parents. Whatever food there is, they always leave some for their child. Whatever clothing there is, it is always given to the child first. Life may have poverty and wealth. The nurturing of children is the same kindness. Since childhood, they have raised you to be an adult. Parents have exhausted all kinds of efforts. In old age, they rely entirely on your support. Meat and fine clothing are provided to nourish your parents. Always be at their side, attending to them diligently. Afraid that you only care for your wife and children. You have little time to care for your elderly parents. How can there be heartless people in the world? I urge you to quickly be filial to your parents. What are you if you are not filial to your parents? Since ancient times, there have been so many filial sons. Let me explain them one by one in detail. Yu Shun's great filial piety moved the heavens. Elephants plowed the fields, and birds weeded. His stubborn parents often wanted to harm him. Kui Kui delivered grain, transforming his parents. Emperor Wen of Han governed the world with benevolence and filial piety. Empress Dowager Bo suffered from illness for three years. He personally tasted the medicine and did not remove his clothes. Morning and evening, he tirelessly comforted his mother. Zeng Shen, a disciple of Confucius, was filial. When guests came to the house, he was at a loss. His mother bit her finger, and his heart ached. He hurriedly carried firewood and rushed back home. He knelt before his mother and asked the reason. In the Zhou Dynasty, Min Sun Zi Qian was filial. In his hemp clothing, he felt cold and lost his grip on the reins. The old father, hearing this, wanted to divorce his stepmother. He knelt on the ground and begged to keep his stepmother. Zilu Zhongyou, a disciple of Confucius, carried rice for his parents for a hundred miles. Later, when he returned in glory after his parents had passed away, he regretted that they could not share it. Tanzi was naturally filial. His parents only thought of drinking deer milk. He wore deerskin clothing and lived among the deer. He was almost hit by an arrow and his life was nearly lost. He did not claim to be old, Lao Laizi. He danced in colorful clothes to entertain his parents. He slept on the ground, imitating children playing. The elderly parents smiled happily. During the Han Dynasty, Dong Yong's family was poor and destitute. He sold himself to bury his father, moving the heavens. He met a fairy under the Huai tree. He weaved silk to redeem himself.</p>

<h3>"Desire" - A Film Longed for by Ten Thousand People</h3>
<p>Premiering at the Grand Light Cinema on Friday</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich's passionate and unrestrained nature has long been familiar to movie fans. The production company has also utilized her special personality to continuously produce outstanding works. Her seductive power on the screen has stirred the heartstrings of countless viewers. Paramount's latest production, "Desire," of course, still strives to utilize her talent to the fullest. The plot tells the story of a female thief who is moved by the power of love and inspires the intelligence to change for the better. The entire play uses a string of stolen pearl necklaces and the beginning and end of their love as the main force of the description. Dietrich plays Mettylin, appearing as a female swindler. Her facial makeup and clothing are very suitable, and her demeanor is also very gentle and mysterious. Later, in the process of falling in love with Tom, she played it even more lingering and enthusiastic. Gary Cooper has been famous in the film industry since he starred in films such as "The Wedding Night" and "Sergeant York," and he has recently been hailed as Hollywood's great lover. This time, he and Dietrich collaborated again after "Morocco," playing a pure and passionate young man, Tom, portraying the psychology of a virgin seeking love and comfort. He can carefully portray both the beginning and the end, and he is indeed worthy of being a master of expression. Director Frank Borzage is a romanticist and sentimentalist. His exquisite skills in handling "Desire" are indeed amazing. In addition, Lubitsch's supervision is like icing on the cake. This film is scheduled to premiere at the Grand Light Cinema on Friday and is indeed a good film worth introducing.</p>

<h3>"Waves Washing Sand" - A Short Comment</h3>
<p>Lianhua's first dialogue sound film, "Waves Washing Sand," uses the latest American-style radio receiver to receive sound, and the sound recorder is the very experienced Kuang Zanjun, so the clarity and brightness of the pronunciation is rare in domestic films.</p>
<p>"Waves Washing Sand" has a grand theme and a new and powerful performance style, which can create a new record in today's film industry.</p>
<p>Jin Yan's heavy performance and excellent acting skills in this film are the greatest success seen in three years, so all movie audiences should not miss this film.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhizhi's performance of a kind of rude and bold spirit in "The Goddess" has won good reviews. "Waves Washing Sand" is another collaboration between him and Wu Yonggang, the director of "The Goddess," and the mutual cooperation is excellent.</p>
<p>"Waves Washing Sand" is a purely artistic work. It is generally expected that the birth of this film will satisfy movie lovers' appreciation.</p>
<h3>"Incarnation Girl" - Unofficial History</h3>
<p>— Bai Mu</p>
<p>The screenwriter of "Incarnation Girl" is the famous film theorist Huang Jiamo. He not only adopted a brand new theme in this play, but also opened up an extremely novel path in terms of film form and technique.</p>
<p>The director is Fang Peilin. In the past, he was one of the best set designers in the Chinese film industry. Here, he used delicate artistic techniques to handle this mysterious and wonderful drama. Therefore, in any aspect, "Incarnation Girl" has achieved very beautiful results.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun is the "Incarnation Girl" in the play. Due to the plot, she transforms into a man and a woman alternately, her whereabouts are erratic and elusive.</p>
<p>Wang Yin plays Yuan Meiyun's lover, but at first, he didn't know that Yuan Meiyun was actually a woman, so many jokes were made.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan is infatuated with Yuan Meiyun, but later, when she learns Yuan Meiyun's secret, she cries sadly.</p>
<p>Han Langen plays Yuan Meiyun's cousin, whose mouth is more greedy than a cat's, so many jokes are made and it is full of fun.</p>
<p>Among the whole play, the scene where Wang Guilin discovers Yuan Meiyun's secret is the most mysterious and stimulating.</p>
<p>Xu Manli, Qin Tong, Jiang Xiu, Ye Wenqiu, and Zhao Manna also made extremely outstanding contributions.</p>
<p>The photography is by Yao Shiquan. The beauty of the picture and the softness of the light add a lot of power to the drama.</p>
