<h3>急轉直下的意阿戰爭</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>經歷了五個多月的意阿戰爭最近已有急轉直下的趨向自從上月初恩巴阿拉基山一役後阿軍以勇猛的擊撲損失頗大不得已向後退却於是意軍以急速的步驟北上取得公達爾西進直達查那湖地帶復集巾全力南下奪取通達阿京的耍隘台西同時在阿國南部沃加丹陣地格蘭齊尼所率之意軍也以全力挺進企圖於最短期內佔領哈拉爾及吉吉迦關於台西的佔領及北面阿香奇湖一役的勝負意阿戰報並不一致意軍謂大獲勝利且已佔領台西但阿方則加以吾認并云阿皇的軍隊二萬人在阿香奇湖西南大獲勝利擊死意軍二千四百人這雙方的戰報顯然都不能完全憑信但就大勢言目前意軍確已全佔優勢若將台西陣地完全取得加以鞏固則阿京的傾覆乃是旦夕間的事情</p>
<p>然而我們估計意阿戰爭的勝負不能單看東非戰塲上的發展而也須顧到其他的兩個重要方面簡單的說意阿戰爭是在三個陣綫上進行的一個是東非的軍事陣綫一個是日內瓦的外交陣錢一個是意國內部的經濟陣綫所以在東非的戰况之外我們尚應觀察到日內瓦與意國內部的戰况</p>
<p>事實上此次意阿戰爭中阿國的失敗主要還是由於日內瓦外交陣綫上的缺點對意制裁的實施到某種限度而中止而德奧幾個國家都未參加也多少打擊到制裁的陣綫同時希特勒的撕毀羅卡諾公的使西歐形勢俄然緊張英法對德態度的緩急不同使日內瓦對意的陣綫大受影響所以十三國委員會要求意阿媾和之議在意方堅决拒絕之下終無結果國聯不能依照盟的加緊對意的制裁意軍遂得盡其全力向阿方推進務以取得城下之盟而後已</p>
<p>不過東非的阿軍雖然未能始終堅守陣地日內瓦的制裁行動也不能一貫到底但在戰爭的過程中意國內部經濟陣綫上所受的打擊確已十分嚴重據哈瓦斯社本月十三日巴黎電訊意國銀行存金現在每月的减少五萬萬里拉截至最近爲止東非戰費已在七十萬萬里拉以上預計東非戰爭結東後意軍調遣歸國尚須鉅大支出總計全部戰費當在一百二十萬萬里拉之數費如許代價獲取一塲勝利意國所得到的痛苦的敎訓我們决不能給以太低的估計又據哈瓦斯社十四日倫敦電訊每日導報羅馬訪員祁格略最近發表一論文說「東非戰事無論勝敗誰屬意國終必一貧如洗其出口貿易至少在二十年內亦必渺小不足道」意國侵阿戰爭在經濟陣綫上所受打擊由此可見一斑而這種打擊對意國內部統治的影響我們也不能加以忽視</p>
<p>就現狀說我們還不能估計意阿戰爭究將如何結束意國的希望當然要利用日內瓦外交陣綫上的軟弱之點加緊獲取東非軍事前陣上的勝利以掩蔽他在國內經濟陣錢上的失敗但是從阿皇的堅毅表示上看意國這種希望能吾順利如意尚難斷言而在阿國方面則全世界的弱小民族及同情於弱小民族者都將給與「雖敗猶榮」的定評</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯會行政院十三國委員會本日午後濱續會議、當經承認該委員會爲解决意阿爭端而進行之和解工作、業已失敗、並議决以討論經過情形、向行政院提出報吿、此項報吿書、當由委員會于明日舉行最後一次會議時、加以草就、而後提交行政院審査之、據本社訪員所知、上項决議、係法國不管部閣員彭古所主張、蓋英國艾登外相前曾聲明、和解工作、若果失敗、則此後步驟、可在下列兩途之中、擇一行之、或則立卽召集十八國小組委員會、討論加緊制裁問題、或則向行政院提出申請、彭古現所建議者、乃係第二項辦法、業由十三國委員會决定照辦矣、行政院現已定於下星期一日午前十時半開會、屆時當由十三國委員會主席瑪達里亞伽出席，公開報吿失敗情形、俾意阿兩當事國、得向行政院正式陳述其見解、而由世界輿論、判斷曲直、其他關係各國、亦可乘此機會、表明其立塲、行政院當俟討論終結之後、通過决議案一件、惟此項决議案、是吾僅將談判失敗之事實、予以備案幷向兩交戰國再度呼籲、維持和平、而將加緊制裁辦法、暫緩實行、抑或决定暫時延會、俾關係各國政府、得在延會期間、重行考慮時局情形、則現尙不可知耳、據本社訪員所知、十三國委員會和解工作、雖巳失敗、但就國聯會各會員國之合作事業而論、前途頗可樂觀、則以各國似均主張處理意阿爭端之情形、當與歐洲時局之需要相適應故也、英國艾登外相、法國不管部閣員彭古、頃均向報界發表宣言、對子雙方互求諒解之精神、交相稱道、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）國聯會行政院十三國委員會、對於意阿爭端調解失敗之後、名記者塔布衣夫人、頃在事業報發表評論云、「十三國委員會調解工作、雖歸失敗、但有一項結果、尙屬可取、質言之、卽英法兩國現行關係、現已有所改進、而加緊對意制裁之議、適足以引起英法兩國之齟齬、至若强使意國中止戰爭、惟有採取軍事制裁手段、始克有濟、凡此諸端、英國外相艾登、均已了然腦中、幷當使英國政府、亦從而了解之、所謂結果、卽此是也、屆時英國內閣、若能接受此意、則國聯會行政院下星期一日開會時、或當通過决議案、對於十三國委員會調解失敗之舉、加以備案、反之、英國內閣若果訓令艾登、採取積極政策、艾登自必要求國聯會行政院加緊制裁手段、而將禁運煤油一層、包括在內、直至意阿爭端獲得公平解决辦法而後已、雖然、英國內閣究當採取何項態度、則此間消息靈通人士、此際尙無所知」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿皇致牒國聯、指責國聯各國延緩厲行有效的對意制裁、並要求立卽實施終止意國侵略之計畫、文內稱阿比西尼亞忍待七月盼望國聯實施終止意國侵略之計畫、不意終成幻夢、試問集體安全之原則今是吾已成具文乎、但阿比西尼亞仍抱驅逐境內侵略者之决心、一面堅决正式援引渠爲國聯會員國應有之權云、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會秘書廳、頃將阿國代表團最後一次照會、（卽拒絕意國所提條件之照會、）全文予以公佈、擄稱意國對于未來和議談判、反對國聯會參加其事、而僅允以進展情形、隨時通知、十三國委員會、此其主張、對于時局無所裨益、阿國茲特再度聲明、準備在國聯會機構之內、幷依照國聯會盟的之精神、進行談判、而意國則不願如此辦理、此在十三國委員會應卽予以備案幷儘速實施全部制裁辦法、母再稽延云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯會秘書長愛文諾、頃接得阿國政府來電內稱、今晨八時有意國轟炸飛機兩架、在阿京上空飛過、幷放射機關槍若干發、當時阿國方面並未向各該飛機射擊、俾無所藉口、而向阿京施行轟炸云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）阿國駐英公使瑪爾丁、擬爲該</p>

<h3>國聯調解失敗　意國不以爲異　所採態度無所變更</h3>
<p>（羅馬）國聯會十三國委員會和解工作、業已失敗、意國負資人士聞訊之後、不願加以評論、此在政界人士對於國聯會和解努力、原不期其成功、故亦不以爲異、意國所採立塲、此際無所變更、其在阿國境內之軍事行動、自當繼續推進、並令遠征軍總司令巴陀格里奧上將、尅日進佔阿京也、政界人士指出意國海陸兩軍、業已採取各項必要措置、俾歐洲一且有事、意國受人攻擊之時、卽可出而應付云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間當局聲稱、意阿之媾和、今有三重困難、　非俟勝方已進抵軍險之地、不能下令停止軍事行動、　阿王旣失所在、阿國已無握大權者能與開媾和談判、　意國不能在制裁威脅下開始談判、（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>北路意軍司令部移台西　南路意阿軍戰爭劇烈　阿軍趕築興登堡式防綫　一說意軍已佔領哈拉爾</h3>
<p>阿京　美國代辦安球特今日通吿此間美國僑民於意軍飛機襲擊時、避入英國公使館、阿政府亦準備於必要時向西遷都、地點大概爲離此一百二十五哩外之此羅、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日得悉阿比西尼亞南路前錢發生激戰、意軍進展甚速、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間盛傳南路意軍、業已佔領阿國哈拉爾城、此路戰事、卽從此宜吿結束云、據哈拉爾城位於阿國京城與法屬吉布底港之間、係在鐵路錢附近、亦卽阿國通海要道、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　意軍總司令部今日遷往台西、卽駐於阿軍總部舊址、並在前皇宮附近開始建築極大無綫電台、在阿國北部被佔各城市、已有電話通用、除參謀部人員外、尙有大砲隊及運輸汽車一大隊、開抵台西、（十七日國民電）</p>
<p>台西　此間現正忽遽佈置、以待意軍中參謀員今夜之蒞臨、故意軍旦夕卽將進窺阿京、伊利特里砲兵軍團已於今日開抵、隨有馬達載重車百餘輛、衆料意軍一旦開始前發、三日內可抵阿京、近數日來意軍中之工程師甚爲忙碌、已在台西造成有高電力之無綫電臺一所、台西與意軍所佔阿國各鎭、今已可互通電話、斥堠隊已在台西南面通阿京大道上前進、據報、未見任何屯集之敵軍、亦未見敵軍謀作抵抗之象、據最近消息、第七軍團已佔據太那湖西面之巴拉薩平原、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　北路意軍刻正鞏固其在臺西之陣綫、以作進攻阿京之準備、南路意軍則聞爲大雨所阻、羅馬雖有哈拉爾與達加哈摩杜二路發生惡戰之說、然意軍在此方面實未能活動、南路阿軍總司令那錫布與土耳其顧問章希白現正趕築興登堡陣綫、據阿人言、三條大路上現以最新方法建築戰綫、另有一綫、在齊齊加與哈拉爾之前、聞已築成、以便保護通至英屬索瑪里倫之大路、此路現爲阿國輸入軍火之要道、阿國近購得抵制坦克車之砲多尊、將力拒南路意軍前進、惟阿國之眞正危機、則爲北路意軍之攻其後也、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　此問昨日舉行國務會議、但一切議决案件、均未公布、北路軍情甚難明瞭眞相、表面上似覺阿軍大調部隊、前往增防、南路軍報謂、意方已採取新攻勢、前錢已有數處開始接觸（十八日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　此間負責各界謂、羅馬所傳阿皇已死、或阿皇已遜位、將由其子繼限等說、全無根據、阿政府現仍日與阿皇通電云、又據某英人目擊者聲稱、意軍中之菲兵登山佔據强固之防地後、阿皇太子見勢不佳、乃由台西退走、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間有驚人謠言、據謂阿王在率軍退出瓜蘭之際、業已被殺、太子向反對其父仇意政策、現準備與意方議和、而踐王位云、意軍已佔哈拉爾之說、雖未證實、但南陣綫意軍司令格拉齊亞尼將軍之部下聞分兩股沿哈拉爾與達加哈摩杜兩路前進、又聞此第二路軍隊現正惡戰、擬街破阿軍固守之陣地（十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>意國大砲　不絕運往東菲　集中意屬地各港口</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國大批軍用品、運往東菲、仍絡繹不絕、此項軍用品以大砲爲最多數、日來運輸輪船開往東菲者、日見數起、今日那不勒期港有兩船開往東菲、每艘均載大砲在一千尊以上、此外尙有各項槍械及其他軍用品、數師團砲兵聞匕由特利挨斯特及其他港口登船、開往前綫、集中砲隊引起此間非常注意、因東菲之戰、迄今仍未曾援用此種利器、政界方面相信、此種利器之運往地點、爲意屬各港口、以作增防之用云、（十七日國民電）</p>
<h3>土耳其海峽　恢復軍備問題　蘇俄復文表示贊同</h3>
<p>安戈拉　雅典方面盛傳、土耳其軍隊業已開入達達尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽非武裝區域、此間半官式通信社阿那都里社頃加以吾認、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>雅典　政府方面頃接獲報吿、據云土耳其政府、業已派遣軍隊、開入達達尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽非武裝區域、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>雅典　按之雅典通信社所發消息、內閣總理梅達克薩新、頃宣稱、土耳其軍隊開入達達尼爾與博斯破魯斯兩海峽非武裝區域之說、幷非土耳其京城所傳出、土耳其政府幷已聲明、此次問題、當由國聯會行政院加以處理云（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>安戈拉　據可靠方面消息、內閣日前開會、業已决定派兵進駐達達尼爾博斯破魯斯兩海峽、並據謠傳、軍隊已於本月十六日晚間開入海峽地帶、惟此層已由半官式阿那都里通訊社加以否認、按歐戰後之塞佛爾條的及希土戰爭後之洛桑條的相繼規定、達達尼爾海峽與博斯破魯斯海峽兩岸、爲非武裝地帶、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）士耳其政府於本月十一日以照會一件、送致洛桑條的各簽字國、（英·法·意·日·希臘·南斯拉夫·羅馬尼亞·保加利亞、）與其他關係國對於該的第十八條、關於達達尼爾海峽及博斯破魯斯海峽撤廢軍備之條約、要求加以修正、外交委員李維諾夫頃向土耳其大使瓦西夫提出復文、據聞內容係謂蘇聯政府對於土耳其此項意向、並無異議、但當要求土國提出保證、准許蘇聯艦隊得以自由通過該兩海峽云云、一般人預料土國對此要求、當可提出滿意答復、又某高級官員頃宣稱、蘇士兩國邦交素篤、兩國睦誼若一日得以保持、則海峽地帶重行設防問題、對於俄國卽一日小致發生妨害」云云、政界方面對於土國要求不以爲異、此其理由有二、　洛桑條約蘇聯並未參加、而土耳其應在海峽地帶享有完全主權、亦爲穌聯所始終主張者、　達達尼爾海峽與博斯破魯海峽一旦重行設防、不啻成爲蘇聯最前一道防錢此層允爲蘇聯所歡迎、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）土軍違反韃靼納爾公約開入海峽區域之說、甫經傳佈、土國半官通信社卽發出吾認文、指此說絕對無稽、並聲稱、十國在本週內舉行內閣會議、査士國進兵海峽區域之說、係由安加拉傳至斯坦布爾、旋傳達馬黎、法報雖傳出此消息、但認爲不盡可信、據此傳說、土國於四月十五日開閣員會議時、由凱未爾總統主席、决定以軍力佔據小駐兵海峽區域、昨晚土軍已開入此禁地云、倫敦人士聞此消息、卽認爲可疑、蓋以土國方請求修改韃靼納爾公的、而有關係國亦允予以同情考慮、英國今日方送出覆文、勸其以正當形式提出此問題、故土國未必遽作此驚人舉動也、（十八日路透電）</p>
<h3>保加利亞表示　要求軍備平等　修改紐易和約</h3>
<p>保加利亞　京城官方人士頃向本社訪員發表談話稱、本國政府現擬要求修正紐易和的、俾可恢復軍備平等權利云、按紐易和的、乃協商各國在歐戰結束時、與保加利亞所締和的、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>紗花　正在觀望中之紗市</h3>
<p>紗市上日趨洛後、昨則父呈安穩平靜之象、市盤晨漲午疲、但市塲交易異常淸寂、多空均抱觀望態度、實緣本月份以交割期限近、多本擯持愈烈、但金融界　金業商多頭始終不動生色云、</p>
<p>標紗買賣淸寂</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、以上日大跌後、場中缺稼賣戶市價緩步上昇、但　面上成交殊鮮、結果各月比上日收盤價漲二·四·五·八角、午後開盤値星期六、市上生意愈淸、達記愼記稍有賣出、惟長豐繼續買進、但現紗交易、南埠略有活動氣象、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌二·三四角、查賣出恒益四百包、明德五百五十包、仁豐四百包、晋康六百五十包、達記八百五十包、愼記六百包、買進錦昌七百五十包、長豐九百包、協成五百五十包、大昶四百五十包、潤康四百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現紗銷路不惡</p>
<p>查全日各帮買去統計八百五十七包、售價漲　角、惟綫價略鬆、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>棉花多空相持頗力</h3>
<p>上日大跌後之棉市、昨則復入穩途、蓋以邇來印棉粗絨棉比封問前飛漲十羅比外、但絨棉亦漲五·六羅比、所以通記在市價下跌時大量吸收、額子殊巨、存賬已達五萬零九千擔之鉅、一般棉商羣向空方、棉市前途、仍在驚濤駭浪中、</p>
<p>標花　面忽緊</p>
<p>標花前市　盤、以美棉漲一至六·磅音、印棉粗絨棉漲兩羅比二五、細絨棉漲二角半、大阪三品花跌四·五角、但市塲人氣堅挺、以上日跌後、大戶多額安然不動、檯面反見聚俏、實則所有虛浮之籌碼、完全被銀行界及金業商吸收、誰一般棉商傾向拋賣、兩方爭鬥、極形劇烈、將後之變化、殊難逆料也、結果各月比上日收盤價漲二角至二角半、午後開盤趨勢仍佳、比紗市為昂、結果各月比上午牧盤價漲五分至一角、查賣出大孚一千九百擔、聚興一千二百擔、達記二千七百擔、同豐一千擔、愼記三千六百擔、同和一千擔、信誠二千八百擔、新亨一千二百擔、明德一千三百擔、買進德大一千擔、錦昌一千三百擔、長興八千二百擔、潤康三千擔、源與昌一千四百擔、通記一千五百擔、協成一千五百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>棉花現銷起色</p>
<p>現棉消費略形起色、廠胃益健、來源姚花　百五十包、通花　百十包、</p>
<h3>同業經紀商一致買進　美菗各月齊漲</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因利物浦消息良好、同業·經紀商·利物浦及孟買帮一致買進、同時鐵克塞斯雨量未遍、奧克拉霍姆天晴、亦為上漲之因、各月漲二至六磅音、旋以五月及七月期有散戶多頭了結、廠家買進現棉、將期棉晚手、市况轉疲、惟售出之額、均為同業限價買進、海斯德氏估計本週廠用為二二九、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底為三三五、〇〇〇包、收盤堅穩、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一至六磅音、英棉現貨跌一點、期貨漲三至五點、印棉期貨商及投機家買進、後以利物浦消息不振、多頭了結而回、計平果爾漲二·二五羅比、奧姆辣漲〇·二五羅比、白羅溪漲半羅比、原電錄左、（十七日電）</p>
<p>又據孟　電、十八日白羅溪花之開盤預測、四五月期為二百零一羅比又四分之一、較上日漲〇·二五羅比、七八月期為二百零三羅比、較上日漲半羅比、</p>
<h3>三品紗花略小</h3>
<p>十八日大阪電、三品期紗跌九角至一元一角、近月為一百化十六元五角、遠月為一百九十六元九角、期棉跌一角五分至九角、近月為六十五元八角五分、遠月為六十一元五角五分、</p>
<h3>絲茶　本推埠絲市稍稍活動　惟橫濱絲價報跌未免受其影響</h3>
<p>昨日本埠絲市續有售開、七月份期二〇·二二條份羅賓漢等級之白廠、漸呈活動、筆喇洋行及信孚連納等、均相繼購進、無奈橫濱絲價報跌、華絲在歐美殊受其競銷影響、故交易未能見旺、用戶絲市甚屬冷靜、里昂倫敦亦尙呆鈍云、</p>
<h3>新龍井茶已到滬</h3>
<p>杭州龍井綠茶、日來已有大批新貨上市、本埠在裕泰程裕新鴻怡泰等茶號、昨日業巳運到六十餘包、聞尙有大宗、陸續袋運來滬云、</p>
<h3>紅茶將組統一推銷機關</h3>
<p>皖贛兩省紅茶、自從安徽省政府議决統制運銷後、滬上各茶棧、以其有　茶棧生存、力持異議、茲悉此事、經滬方一再請求結果、運輸事項、决由省方辦理、銷售部份、仍由各茶棧組織統一推銷機關主持、聞將由茶業中、選出資望較深者五人、為常務委員、全權辦理其事云、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉市穩固漲度尙㣲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份續呈穩固之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲六七角不等、坎拿大漲四角另、市場人心、因洋麥連漲、及國內底碼不豐、大部分人心、當然均看穩固、惟本月份雖屬陳　、但與六月份價格、究屬相差二角零、故非有實銷生意、不敢收買、是以漲度尙微、至遠期各月份、人心雖好、究為新麥時令、因此初好一分外、後則回平、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易戶轉淸寂、價呈盤旋、的有一分出入、後步情形、如廠拋不暢、當看平穩云、</p>
<h3>期麥多頭趁高回出</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份因洋麥又漲四六七角不等、市場人心又趨堅俏、開價時較前日漲三五分不等、以後則因多頭回出、回下二三分、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易較上午略淸、因買氣不暢、市稍回疲、麥市情形、大的再經過一月、始有把握、彼時如收成有望、方有小面可言也、現麥穩定如常、各檔開價一無變動、開山東瑤灣明光麥五元三角二分、由福新去一千五百包、阜車豐去四百包云、</p>
<p>美麥旱區未能再獲甘霖、預測天晴、粉銷與現貨需要均暢、無雨價格有續漲之勢、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥　四月十六日　四月十七日　上落</p>
<p>五月份　九七·八七五　一〇〇·〇〇〇　漲二·一二五</p>

<h3>小朋友走那條路</h3>
<p>— 張肇和</p>
<p>在童年時代的我們，正預備將來走入社會，求美滿的人生，所以處處要有「眞實」的表現，不要帶絲毫的「虛偽」。校中公民的課程，天天在敎訓我們。養成良好的人格。近來社會中黑慕重重，人心險惡一天不如一天，小朋友們受了惡環境的纏橈，惡潮流的薰陶，難免要影響我們各人的個性哩！</p>
<p>「眞實」是天良的表現。一舉一動，不自欺不欺人的行為，極易得人的同情和贊成。將來服務社會，便宜得多哩！</p>
<p>「虛偽」是口是心非，言不顧行，貪圖眼前便宜。一旦破敗，任人唾駡，社會上無他的立足地，對於將來的生活，有大大的危險。</p>
<p>這樣看來，「眞實」和「虛偽」兩條路，不可以不認淸，不可以不决定。要知道那條路可走。那一條路不可走。親愛活潑的小朋友們，請你們要慎重的選擇纔好！</p>
<h3>岳飛的童年時代</h3>
<p>— 寗自强</p>
<p>小朋友！我們現在談起民族英雄，岳飛可要算「首屈一指」了，當南宋的時侯，內憂外患，和現在差不多，那時這位岳飛，便不惜犧牲，和女眞國開戰，着着勝利，勢如破竹，不料朝中出了一個奸臣，名呌秦檜的，要他把兵調回來，將他害死，「功敗垂成」，眞是可惜得很，啊！閑話不表，言歸正傳，談談他的幼年吧！</p>
<p>岳飛是河南湯陰縣人，幼時就死了父親，靠著他的母親做着女紅養活他，岳飛自少得了他的母親的敎訓，深明大義，他母親替他背上刺了「盡忠報國」四個字，以示「永矢勿忘」的意思，他並且得着周侗先生的敎導，修文講武，伴件精通，所以可概括他的明是非，別利害，忠君愛國，效死疆塲，是得之於母敎：至於他的武藝高强，戰略精通，則又得力於周侗先生之「循循善誘」不少。小朋友！我國現在的環境，比南宋時惡劣得多，人人該學岳飛精忠報國啊！</p>
<h3>介紹兒童通信社</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>愛爾頓氏說：「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」。我們如果把愛氏這一句話，細細的考量一番，覺得是很有深意的。唯其二十世紀是兒童的世紀，因此我們在這二十世紀裏，應該切切實實的為兒童謀幸福，替兒童打算一切生活上的改善。這樣，才算是尊重民族的根苗</p>
<p>上海俞塘民衆敎育館，在過去為了培養小先生起見，曾經組織了一個「小先生聯盟會」，現在，更為訓練兒童通信的能力，又組織了一個兒童通訊社。該社的宗旨，一方面為謀兒童生活互相溝通，同時並設法增進兒童的發表文字的效能。通信的方法，分團體與個人兩種，通信的內容，以兒童生活為中心，語體文為主體，圖畫照片等為輔助。通信的時間，每星期暫定一决，信伴之往返，卽由指導員於每星期一總集合時負責帶交。該社並設郵務長一人，負責往來信件的收發。兒童通信的用箋，均以國貨信封信箋為原則：對內通信，信紙由總社印發，信封由兒童在手工科製造；如有對外方小先生通信時，所用信紙信封，則由敎育館分發，以歸統一，凡一切信伴的往返，均推人保管，倘有優良信伴，卽行公佈，以資觀摩。這許多都是兒童通信社的辦法，我覺得對於兒童的訓練，倒是一個很好的組織。很希望各地敎育機關，也繼起仿效，那末，對於兒童生活的興趣，一定可以增進不少的。</p>
<h3>踏靑歌</h3>
<p>— 晋豪</p>
<p>一九三四年上春，我在宜昌時常獨自一人到山頭上去看人家祭墳掃墓，無意中，却聽得一個乞丐唱着一隻短歌，覺得很有意味，現在記它出來，以供同好：</p>
<p>踏靑踏靑大家踏，</p>
<p>齊把靑草任糟塌。</p>
<p>踏踏草兒算甚麼？</p>
<p>世間眼前多如麻！</p>
<p>富者會把貧者欺，</p>
<p>壯者會把弱者殺！</p>
<h3>動植物和人類的關係</h3>
<p>— 尢墨君</p>
<p>旣然做了一個人，我們總都知道衣·食·住·行四者是我們所一天不可避免的。衣·食·住·行，包括的範園雖然很大，但是我們為適應這四者起見，不能不仰賴於我們四週的生物，卽動植物是。現把動植物和我們人類的關係的略地述之如左：</p>
<p>先說衣　到了寒天，我們須穿皮衣，這是取之於獸類的。一切毛織品的東西，如果沒有駝羊等獸，也是做不成的。絲織品，大家都知道靠著蠶絲，蠶亦是動物啊。還有棉花可以保暖，棉紗可以織布，夏天我們常穿麻織品的衣服；這都是有賴於植物的。</p>
<p>次說食　動物的肉，如牛肉，猪肉等；卵，如鷄卵。鴨卵等；乳，如牛乳，羊乳等；我們日常所吃的東西，那一樣不靠着動物？米。麥等是我們主要的食物，這是屬於禾穀類。大豆。碗豆等，屬於豆菽類；它們可以煮食，可以熬油。橘子。香蕉等屬於果實類。還有，蔬菜類的東西，更是舉不勝舉。便是我們的嗜好品，如茶·酒·烟捲，又那一樣不和植物有關係的？</p>
<p>再說住　建築房屋的原料是木材。家具如桌·椅等亦取之於木材。作為燃料用的像柴·炭等，又那一樣不是木材？所以沒有植物，我們的住的問題便不能解决了。况且森林還可以防水災啊。</p>
<p>末說行　駝·馬·牛等或可代步，或可代我們服役，像耕田，載重等事是。這是動物和我們的行的問題有很大的關係的。蒸汽發動機及汽油發動機所需的石炭。石油本來是古生物；這又是一例。植物呢，像電杆木及鐵道上所舖的枕木都取之於木材，與人類的「行」亦有關係的。</p>
<p>從上看來，小朋友總可明白動植物和人類有怎樣的關係了。</p>
<h3>十分鐘的科學敎學做</h3>
<p>— 白桃</p>
<p>熱的把戲</p>
<p>世界上的一切神秘的事情，都有一定的法則。例如我們燒水吧，也是根據一定法則的：倘若我們把火放在鍋上面燒，一輩子都不會燒開。那是因為水熱了，就膨脹變輕向上升，而冷水因為重便沉下來。因此，冷水和熱水上下對流起來。到後來，全鍋的水就都熱了。同時，空氣也和水一樣，空氣熱了也膨脹變輕向上升，而冷重的空氣便沉下來。例如我們的。用一張厚紙，在厚紙上畫起一圈圈的圓圈來。然後用剪刀齊圓圈一直向圓心剪去，就剪成一個紙圈圈兒。把紙圓圈中央紮上一根綫。於是，點起一枝蠟燭來。把紙圈兒套到燭火的上方去，紙圈兒便會旋轉起來。這是一個很有趣的把戲。這把戲吿訴我們，燭熖上方的空氣，因為被燒熱了，就膨脹變輕向上飛升。這一股向上升的空氣，實在就是一股熱風。熱風吹在紙圓圈上，紙圈兒便旋轉起來。</p>
<p>上圖指明爐里的熱空氣向上升；下圖指明從冰上滑過的冷空氣向下落。、</p>
<p>在爐里燒火，通過爐里的空氣被燒熱了。熱空氣便向上升，當他升到鍋壁上的時候，便把熱傳給鍋壁，鍋壁再把熱傳給水，水便熱了起來。我們還可以玩個把戲，來證明熱空氣是上升這圖指明，火焰上方的紙圓圈，因為被向上升的熱空氣衝動了，便旋轉起來。</p>
<p>熱空氣是上升的。所以火爐放在底下，而上面是熱的。但冷空氣便不是這樣。冷空氣因為比較重，牠是向下沉的。比方你在夏天吃冰淇淋或吃刨冰。你要想水很快的冰冷下來，那末，就應該把冰放在杯上面，不應該放在下面。那些家庭主婦和菜館的廚司夫，常常把冰箱里的冰，放在頂上一格，而把魚，肉，牛奶，水菓……等等，放在下面，就是這個緣故。因為從冰上滑過的冷空氣，因為冷了便向下沉，流過那些食物，因此那些食物也冰冷的了。</p>
<h3>馬路上不是遊戲的地方</h3>
<p>— 重樓</p>
<p>前天我在馬路上走，看見許多兒童在那裏游戲，這使我想到蘇俄敎科書上對於我國所載的一句語。</p>
<p>蘇俄的敎科書上曾經這樣簡單的說過我國，它說：「那是一個從前很强盛而現在却衰弱了的國家，最顯著的病態就是許多農人都不種田了，到都市裹去拉人力車！許多兒童都失學了，在馬路上亂玩！」這是多麼使我國人痛心的話啊，尤其是「兒童們失學在馬路上亂玩，」雖然我國兒童儘多不失學不在馬路亂玩的，但是我們眼前時常總可以看見許多失學游戲在馬路上的兒童</p>
<h3>兩種兒童</h3>
<p>這樣的病態當然不能全怪兒童，為甚麼不給他們受敎育呢？爲什麼給他們沒有正式的遊戲場所呢？</p>
<p>不過我還要勸勸在馬上遊戲的兒童：假使你們的父母是無錢的，你們也應該自修自學，因為在馬路上玩不但荒廢了時間，並且對於生命也是很危險的呀</p>
<h3>告兒童之友讀者</h3>
<p>本館新出「兒童之友」第二集，因急於付印，錯誤自屬難免，現初版售完，再版日內即可出書，所有錯字，已完全改正，特為聲明（編者）</p>

<h3>畫謎</h3>
<p>— 雪子作</p>
<p>小玲沒有留意前面是條小河，所以撲通的落到水中去了，並且嘴裏還喊着：「救命呵！救命呵！」眞幸運的，這聲音給伊的小朋友阿牛聽見了，他雖然有勇氣，可是有着像這樣複雜的三條路，正是需要放出敏快的手段的，然而阿牛是着急了。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友呵，你們快些替他想方法呵！那一條直達的路來救墮入小河中的小朋友呵。</p>
<h3>我將來做怎樣的人</h3>
<p>— 歙縣明倫堂小學郭成志</p>
<p>（第十二名）</p>
<p>東北失地，以至華北事變，全國人民都為之震動；就是世界各國，也非常注意這些事。</p>
<p>怎樣會發生這些事呢？籠統的講一句，都是中國富於依賴性，貪圖一時的苟安，漸至失了自信力，才受到□□帝國主義的壓迫和侵略。</p>
<p>在這整個民族生死存亡關頭，要想求個人有出路，先耍為民族求出路，所以這時我國最需要的，是有科學頭腦和軍事智識的人材。</p>
<p>我的志願就是希望將來做一個救國的軍人；因此我對於我校的童子軍訓練，非常的歡喜參加，和特別的注意。</p>
<p>做軍人！並不是像我國已往那種北洋軍閥，他們在平時又是狐假虎威的去欺壓百姓，做出種種不法的事來。這種軍閥，可以說是國家的寄生蟲，人民的公敵。</p>
<p>我所要做的軍人又是怎樣的呢？老實說一句，除了科學的頭腦和軍事智識以外，還要有智，仁，勇的人格。這才能為我國家謀幸福，為我民族爭光榮！也就是我個人得了一條光明大道了。</p>

<h3>眞輔幣爲什麼吸得起？</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>現在我們有了新銅板新角子了（總稱為新輔幣）。小朋友，你們看見過麼？這種新輔幣分為五種：</p>
<p>半分的（銅質）　　一分的（銅質）</p>
<p>五分的（鎳質）　　十分的（鎳質）</p>
<p>廿分的（鎳質）</p>
<p>新輔幣一分，等於從前的三十文，（就是三枚大淸銅板或舊國旗銅板）。照這樣算法，半分等於十五文；五分等於一百五十文；十文等於三百文；二十分等於六百文。</p>
<p>新輔幣十分等於角子鈔票一角；廿分等於角子鈔票二角。</p>
<p>新輔幣是十進制的：十分等於一角；十角等於一元。（從前是銀圓一枚。現在改用鈔票，不准用銀圓了。）這種十進貨幣制度，比起以前雜亂無章的貨幣，要便利，有規則多了，——以前的輔幣分什麽小洋，大洋；角子又有「藥水角」，「鉛板角」，「私板角」，「廣角」，「江南」……等十多種名目，眞弄得人頭昏腦脹！</p>
<p>自從有了新輔幣之後，我國各地人民用起來都覺得很便當。</p>
<p>不過，有了眞的，就有假的，現在市面上巳有十分和廿分的假貨幣出世了。它們的花紋和大小，與眞的一式一樣，不過顏色不如眞的：眞輔幣與假輔幣之間的差異地方如</p>
<p>假的：灰白色　不光潤　質軟，用力咬，有齒印；</p>
<p>眞的：色白如银　發亮光　質硬，用力咬，無齒印。</p>
<p>假輔幣是用鉛造成的，眞輔幣是用鎳造成的。我們還有一個最容易的分辨方法。就是用吸鐵石去吸，假的吸不起，眞的一吸就起。因為鎳有磁性，遇着吸鐵石，便吸合起來了。</p>
<h3>義狗傳（十五）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>他們並不拒絕或否認，很恭敬的接待他，村中的人都聚攏　、對他瞧彼此交頭接耳的說道：「你不見他嗎？他是人中之王，他是一位大美術家，全世界都提起他的姓名；然而他不過是我們的可憐的小南洛，當初直好像一個小乞兒，靠着他的狗幫助着，天天換麵包米吃。</p>
<p>他心中想他將怎樣的把皮裘和紫袍結老祖父穿，更給他畫一幅圖像，聖的克禮拜寺中的聖徒一樣，他又將怎樣把一個金項圈套在柏德希的脖子裏，放在他老人家的右首，然後對人們說：「這是我以前的唯一的朋友；他又將怎樣給自己造一座白大理石的宮殿和富麗的花園，從斜坡上望出去，可以瞧見那大禮拜寺塔尖，而他自已並不住在裏面，却公開的給一般有大志而窮苦無吿的靑年們　居住；他們要是稱頌他時，他就向他們說道：「不，不要謝我——只要謝人畫家羅本士好了。倘沒有他的傑作鼓勵我，那我也沒有今犬這一天了。</p>
<p>他懷着這些美麗而不可能的夢想，沒有一切自私自利的觀念，抱着崇拜英雄的志願，很快樂的度他的生活——就是在小愛洛命名紀念日的那天，他也照常的快樂得很，同着柏德希回到他那黑暗的小屋中去，吃他們的黑麵包，而那時全村的孩子們却都在磨坊中歌唱歡笑，吃着圓形的大蛋糕和杏仁的薑餅。在滿天星斗之下和悠揚的笛聲琴聲中，他的合夥兒在大穀倉裏跳舞。</p>
<p>一不打緊的，柏德希，這是不打緊的，總有這一天甚麽都會改變的。他這樣的對柏德希說着，把他的兩臂抱住了狗的頭頸，一同坐在小屋子的門口，那磨坊中的歡好笑聲和音樂聲從夜風中吹送過來。</p>
<p>從此以後，柏德希每决走過柯甘士的身邊，往往咆哮着表示它的不滿。</p>

<h3>沒有女性之國</h3>
<p>— 成子</p>
<p>希臘塞羅尼加通訊</p>
<p>沒有女性之國，這恐怕是幻想家所描寫的奇怪小說吧。然而，無論你怎樣的懷疑，地球上確有這樣的國士存在着；而且這國土是從千年以前一直保存到現在，它對於世界雖沒有任何的供獻，但它却是長期地佔着地球的一部分面積的。</p>
<p>更奇怪的是這裏不僅沒有人類的女性，而且也沒有雌性的動物。自然，這裏也有雞，有羊，有牛，而且這些也與別個地方的雞羊牛的形狀相同，但其中却沒有一隻雌雞，沒有一匹牝羊和母牛，它們盡都是雄性的。</p>
<p>這樣的沒有女性之國，不在天上，也不在地下，它是在我們的現實世界中，是在離希臘塞羅尼加的八十哩的突出愛琴海的阿都斯半島之南，高達六千呎的阿都斯山的山麓。這個地方共住有四千人，當然盡都是男人，沒有一個女性。這些男入都不准剪髮，所以在這裏只能見着長髮長髯，看不到禿頭，當然也看不得梳得光光的，燙得波紋似的摩登頭。同時，在這奇妙的地方，一切游戲，歌謠，跳舞，戀愛，都是禁止的，甚至就是沐浴和喧嘩也被懸爲禁例。</p>
<p>在阿都斯半島的絕壁的海岸，有二十家寂寞的孤房，每隔一二哩一座的如鳥巢似的存在著。這些孤房是西曆九百年之際建立的僧院，是極壯麗的高樓大廈。在這中間還有學校，敎堂，要塞等。所謂沒有女性之國的四千名男人便是住在這裹里的。</p>
<p>如果只是在很多的僧人中沒有女性，當然還不足奇；特別富有奇趣的，是在這沒有女性之國中，還有許多為人間所少見乃至想像不到的現象。例如，普通我們所知道的僧院僧人，都是生活在某一國土中并與那裹的一切發生密切關系的，雖然他們自謂已經看破了紅塵。可是這沒有女性之國雖在希臘境內，卻是一個獨立的國土；而且，這國土還有它的首都，名呌加列斯。在這都市中，也有花園，也可聽到敎堂的鐘聲，也可看到在牧場吃草的牡牛，同時還有學校，商店，酒樓，銀行，郵政局的存在；但無論在那一個角落裏，你都看不到一個女人。</p>
<p>沒有女性之國的首都加列斯的百貨商店，其形式當然也和我們通常所見的差不多，只是有一點不同：卽我們在一般百貨商店所看到的明眸皓齒的女店員，在這裏一個也見不着；在這裏接待顧客的全是披髮長鬚的男人。自然，在這店中也沒有高跟皮鞋和女性所需要的一切物品。</p>
<p>大家知道，沒有女性卽沒有男性，這正如沒有男性也不會有女性一樣；依據這個常識的推理，我們當可知道沒有女性之國的男子們並不是在這國土內產生的，而是來自別處的男人。這些男人之成為這國土的國民，原因雖然很多，但大多數却是為了女性的煩惱，為了失業，為了求精神上的安慰，為了逃罪而來到這裏的。因為這些人都死心塌地的願在這裏了結終身，所以他們只有從朝到晚地誠心禱吿和誦讀聖經；實際上除此之外，也似乎無事可作了。</p>
<p>這地方是在愛琴海岸，長期地吹着寒冷的海風，所以冬季很長。但此間的人們就在北風凜冽，大雪霏霏之下，也依然是從朝到晚地祈禱着。因此，在這沒有女性之國中，常時只聽到敎堂的鐘聲，宗敎的唱歌聲，除此以外，便是寂然無聲的死的世界。</p>
<p>沒有女性之國的最神聖，最古而且最有勢力的僧院，名拉甫拉僧院。在聖誕節的前夜，這古老的僧院禮拜堂內要點着無數支的蠟燭，照耀得比電燈還要輝煌：所有的憎人都來參加這聖誕節莊嚴的古代的儀式。在這古代的儀式開始的時候，就有兩個穿着絢爛的僧衣的侍僧，將那用黃金裝裱並飾以眞珠的千四百年以前的福音書，很恭敬地捧了出來，接着白髮蒼蒼的主敎，穿着十個世紀以來着用的金色和紫色的長袍，便很莊重地來打開這福音書，開始詠頌讚美歌，滿堂的僧人們也就隨着不斷的禱吿，他們要異口同聲地喊着：「主愛憐我們」；由此禮拜便達到了最高潮。</p>
<p>為禱吿而生活的這里的僧人當然是已忘掉了女人，忘掉了一切物質的享樂。他們契大麥湯，黑麺包，鹹魚；他們每天午前二時就起床工作，在寒風下禮拜。至於他們的一切習慣，那是至死不變的，如千年以前的僧人不洗操，現在的也是如此。然而說也奇怪，他們很少生病，這也許是由於他們的無憂無慮不思不想的生活所使然的吧。</p>
<p>外面的人要到這沒有女性之國來，是頗不容易的，那非得要到這地方當局的許可不行。至於女人，更是絕對禁止入境。所以，假使婦女要到這里來觀光，便要很巧妙地化裝成男人才行。如果有幾個人同時到這裏來，那必要受嚴重的監視，因為這里的人最怕婦女化裝混進他們的沒有女性之國來，更怕男女同着進來在這「聖地」上講戀愛，演風流喜劇，那是會「沾汚」他們的。</p>
<p>據說在某一個冬天，有兩個德國人來到這里，因為降雪被關在僧院內一時不能出去，於是在國境附近等候的他們的妻子便着急起來，卽刻雇了摩托船，渡過海面，進到這沒有女性之國來，而且狂鳴警笛找尋伊們的丈夫。這警笛的聲音雖然引出了那兩個德國人，但同時也引起了此間僧人的注意，他們都不約而同地追趕在兩個德國人之後，狂呌着：「逐出惡魔！打啊！」一聲霹靂，好像地震一樣，把阿都斯山都震動了。</p>
<p>在一九一六年，因為羅馬尼亞王后來到阿都斯半島，也被這里的僧人認為</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>沾汚了聖地，結果他們為了凟罪，曾不斷地做了七天七夜的祈禱！</p>
<p>又在近年，據說有三個丹麥人帶了正當的許可證來到沒有女性之國觀光。就中有一位雖是男裝，但其姿態有點女兒氣，因此僧人們不放心，給與嚴重的監視，並暗中設法加以檢查，但結果依然不明白究竟。這樣，沒有女性之國就大起風波，四千僧人都談論這個問題，你說我不對，我說你錯誤，形勢嚴重已極，好像一般國家的政治門爭一樣。</p>
<p>科學叢話</p>
<p>— 求眞</p>
<h3>電子望遠鏡</h3>
<p>最近美國無錢電話協會的佐爾庚博士發現了一種電子望遠鏡，這鏡可以明白看見黑暗中的物體；依據Televison（由電波能看見遠隔的物體的裝置）的原理，能變不可視的形態為可視的形態，能將物體發射出的不可視錢（黑暗綫乃至赤外綫）變為可視錢。這樣的電子望遠鏡的發現，不消說在科學上是有極大的供獻的。有了它，便可在大霧中或黑夜里行汽船和飛機，也可研究為普通的光綫所見不到的細菌；當然也能把牠用在軍事方面。據最近的消息，這電子望遠鏡也實際地應甩到照相上去了。</p>

<p>在去年十一月十一日，美國地理學會及陸軍航空隊共同計劃了同溫層的探險。結果探險者搭乘着世界最大的氣球愛克斯勃亞拉第二號，達到了七二，三九五呎（二二，〇六六米）的高度，樹立了探險同溫層的世界新紀錄。</p>
<p>據探險者說，高空中的太陽光比地上更要强烈，如從窗戶直接去看陽光，那簡直不是眼睛所能抵禦。但是，溫度却很低，寒氣逼人，也同樣難於忍受。若在同溫層的高空俯視地下，那便完全是褐色的大地，圓形的太空，人與一切生物當然不能看見；能見到的只是如像大洋的波濤般地起伏的山嶽，巨大的河流和湖泊，特別是在太陽光反射的時候更可明白看見這些。仰望上空，則是一個渺茫的黑晤世界，什麽也見不着。</p>
<p>探險者在飛高到同溫層的氣球中，可以和地上通電話，因此他們在空中的一切遭遇地上都能馬上知道。同時，在他們的探險中，還進行了各種科學的實騐，因此，他們不僅可以更加知道空中的情形，而且還可得到許多科學上的實騐知識。例如，這决美國人的探險，便從地上帶了許多微生物到同溫曆去，結果是這些生物有許多是死了，有些還活着，這在生物學的研究上便有很大的意義。</p>
<p>據這决探險者的預測，將來在準備更周到下去探險同溫層，至少可以昇高到九五，〇〇〇呎。果然，那人類探知自然的秘密，征服自然的技能，將會更顯示出偉大的進步了。</p>
<h3>戈壁沙漠的古代生物</h3>
<p>誰都知道，在荒凉的沙漠地帶，是不適宜於人類乃至生物的生存的，但是，自地球存在以來，現今的沙漠地帶有無生物存在過呢？更有無什麽文化的存在呢？這問題至今還在研究之中。</p>
<p>最近，由於科學的進步，探險家的活躍，過去我們的祖先所不能到達的神秘地方，現在我們也可去探險了，而且由這探險還可得到許多眞確的知識材料，以帮助科學的研究，使之更加發展。沙漠地帶在過去也是未知之謎，但近代的科學關於沙漠已有了許多可靠的考究和發現，使我們對它的一切能日益明瞭。這里要說的，就是最近在戈壁沙漠中又有新的有興味的發現，這發現無論在歷史上科學上都是有極大意義的。</p>
<p>大家知道，戈壁沙漠是大戈壁沙漠的一個支脈。對這個地方的探險家向來很多，也有不少的發現，但可以說有偉大成績的却還未見到。最近美國博物館的館長阿斯本氏更祖織探險隊，實行到這戈壁沙漠去探險，結果發見了生存在數百萬年以前的巨獸的一部分化石，引起了一般專門家大大的注意。同時，有幾個瑞典的地質學者也曾由數百萬年的地質中發現了白楊和榆樹葉的化石。這些植物在現今中央亞細亞也有類似的，而且，這種化石在戈壁沙漠的東方還特別多；同時類似這種的化石在加利弗尼亞的馬加甫沙漠等地方也不少。由於這些事實，美國博物館的館長阿斯本依據他的發現作了這樣一個說明——</p>
<p>在當時的這個地方也許是沼澤之地；住在這兒的世紀前的巨獸大概都是食那些植物而生存的吧。</p>
<p>何以這些巨獸都會死滅呢？這恐怕是因為這地方的沼澤乾涸，値物枯死，而决第餓斃了的吧。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<p>— 諒</p>
<h3>四眼魚</h3>
<p>通常所見到的魚只有兩隻眼睛，但美國博物館有一種魚，却有四隻眼睛，所以名為四眼魚。</p>
<p>其實這種四眼魚也只有兩隻眼睛；不過因為它的眼睛的虹彩很長，分為上下兩部，上部向着水面，專看浮着的香餌，下部向着下面，專看水中，所以，在表面上乃至在作用上都像是四隻眼睛似的。</p>
<h3>珍奇的白色動物</h3>
<p>白鶴，白馬，白羊等等，你當然都見到過，不足為奇，但純白的猿猴，純白的蛙，純白的豪豬，你恐怕連聽都沒有聽到說過；而事實上，最近紐的動物園內却有了這三種珍品。據說這類的珍品在它們的百萬同類中難於找得一個。但科學地研究起來，這恐怕是由人用遺傳法生產出來的吧。</p>

<p>職業婦女的自白</p>
<h3>女看護</h3>
<p>— 何濟仁女士談</p>
<p>我學護士的目的，老實說，起初並不是因為道項職業帶有慈善性質，倒是因為牠是比較容易找得出路的一種　業，所以才花了三年的時間而換得了一個護士的頭銜。</p>
<p>在民國　十年的夏天，從某女中學拿了一張文憑出來，就憑這麽一點資格居然考進了南市一個敎會主辦的醫院學習護士。在　裏修了半年的課程，還繳了五十元的學費，　因　我對宗敎　氣　不　　，　半途血　二了。不　　　　　位剛山美國學成歸國的親戚介紹到滬Ｘ一個慈善醫院繼續學習，這　的規　和組織都要比那敎會醫院　而，另外還　　有　所學堂，裏咖各　門的　　　　　　　。我　去之後　　　　　　　　　　　　　個星期日可以出外。至於上課時間，每天是上午八時至下午五時，這也和普通學校一樣。</p>
<p>時間像流水似的逝去，六個月的讀書時期就在不知不覺中溜走了，從此，便開始實習的工作。第一次我被派到南三號女病房裏服務；那裏有着七八個病人，患的毛病各自不同，而且各人的脾氣也不一致。</p>
<p>「密司Ｘ，你來上班了嗎？好極了！我告訴你，這　事情倒還不多，如果來不及的話，還可以喊人帮忙；不過，」她走近一步向着我耳邊輕輕地說：「你在病人跟前不要露出新來的樣子，不然的話，病人也會「欺生」的呀！」</p>
<p>她含着笑走了。許多病人向我看着，我這時心裹雖有點惶然不安，可是臉上却不好露出來。一會兒，便有一個病人喊了「看護小姐，我這被頭請你替我蓋一下吧？」</p>
<p>我連忙走過去帮她把被頭蓋了。</p>
<p>「看護小姐，我耍　來，請你帮我一下。」另一僩病人的聲音</p>
<p>我曉得她是要起來小便；但這種事却是從來沒替人做過的，心裏倒覺得有些遲疑起來。</p>
<p>「看護小姐，快點囉，我要起來呢！」</p>
<p>聲昔比先前喊得更高，我曉得道不去是不成的；忍着一肚子的不願意，巷她把被頭揭開：「好起來不？」</p>
<p>「不，不行，我腰痛的狠，請你把那東西拿來吧！」</p>
<p>我拿了一隻玻璃的溺器送到她床上，一面替她撐起身子，眼睜睜地瞅着她，大的過了五六分鐘，她依舊還保持着原來的姿式本偶似的坐着，好像並不曾覺察到有我這麼一個人站在她身邊。</p>
<p>「好了麽？我的手酸得撐不住了！」我有點抱怨的樣子。</p>
<p>「哎喲！看護小姐怎麽那性急？看護病人是沒有那麼容易的啊！」好像是老於住院的口吻。</p>
<p>「看護，請你給我一點水吃。」</p>
<p>透邊剛服侍完了，又趕忙跑到那邊去：像茶役似的，身子雖然有時分不　，可是聽得有病人喊，嘴裏却不能不答應。</p>
<p>「太冷了，這水，看護小姐，你也嚐一嚐看，病人好吃這樣的　水麽？」把碗朝椅子上用力的一放。</p>
<p>這南三號病房雖祇有七個病人，可是比在學校的游藝會上招待幾百個來賓還耍吃力些。這一天是從上午十一點鐘工作到下午六點鐘，七小時的工作本來並不算長，但是我下班以後，却累得連一頓晚飯都放棄了。</p>
<p>我開始實習以後，每天還有四小時的課程，所以在病房　習的第二天早晨，依舊要到課堂裏去上課。</p>
<p>「ＸＸ！昨天第一次去實習，就有病人吿你看護得不週到，以後絕對不許那樣！看護對於病人要像照顧自家人一樣，盡心地服侍病人。性子要溫和，不要怕骯髒，做一個看護對於這些條件都是不可少的，肥得麽？」這是一位護士長，她在下課以後，板起面孔炒爆豆似的說了一陣。</p>
<p>吃了一頓「牌頭」，心裹雖覺有萬分的委屈，然而也就不敢辯論。護士長走了以後，我才拔了一位老護士吿訴她昨天的情形，她便也敎給我許多經騐，她說：「一個生了病的人就像孩子差不多，有時簡直沒有一點理性，看護遇到這種人，祇有努力的忍耐。她們要的東西，祇耍不違醫生的吩咐，就儘管給她。譬如說昨天有個病人嫌水太冷了，這可以說是常事，因為醫院裹是不會有那麽多的熱開水，就有時或者有熱水，但是遇着那種膽小的病人，也還是要嫌它太冷的，所以遇到這種病人，就祗有「忍耐」才能制服她。像咋天那邊四號病房有個病人發寒熱，給了他許多凉水吃，他還是說燒得難受，要求再給些更冷點的水吃。你想，道兩個病人如果住在同一房間裏，那不是要麻煩死人麼？」</p>
<p>做護士的確要有「忍耐」心，要不是我還能够有點「忍耐」心，我恐怕當時就不能繼續做下去；原因是我在南三號女病房裏做了不久，又被派到前面男病房裏服務了，道病房裏的人數和女病房裏一樣，可是比起女病人來更要雖看護。</p>
<p>醫院對於病人的熱度，照例每天是有幾决要用寒熱針診斷的，可是有些病人見了看護拿着針走來，便先自表示厭煩的態度，有的甚至還要裝作睡着的樣子，給你一個不理睬；還有些病人正在睡了，那就祗好躡手躡足做賊似的輕輕地把針塞在他脅下。我起初到這裏來看護病人，心裹總以為和看護女病人沒有什麽差別，那裏曉到衹做一星期的工夫，却給了我不少的經騐。有幾　病人有意想出許多事務來找我；有時竟好像預先約好似的來和我開玩笑。譬如那陲在三號和七號床上的病人，他們的毛病原很輕微，可是那天正當我第决來看護時他們便裝得很沉重的樣子，一邊喊要吃水，一邊喊要「小便」。但男病人「便溺」照例是由茶役照顧，所以我就一面喊茶役一面去拿水給另一個病人；可是那要「小便」的病人，見了我祗喊茶役，自己並不過去，他的病便好像在那一秒時間中好了似的，一骨碌坐了起來，後來茶役跑來，他的「小便」也沒有了。像這類的病人，在我那實習的幾個月中，的確是「領敎」了不少；不過，「安分守己」的病人，也不能說沒有，但這些差不多都是有了年紀或患肺病的人居多。</p>
<p>還有一件可怕的事情，我得在這裏順便說一說：</p>
<p>記得那是在一個冬天的晚上，大的有十一點鐘的光景，我看護的這間房的病人都已經睡了，空氣寂靜待像一座古廟。我這時正自低着頭在看一本藥書，不提防那扇玻璃門突的開了，我先還以為是被風吹動的，待抬頭朝外一看，竟把我嚇得半天說不出話來；原來那推門的却是一個男病人，頭上厚厚地紥着幾層紗布，連眼睛也遮沒了。他把門推開，依然還在摸索着往我這病房裏走來。我當時雖然嚇了一跳，可是並沒糊塗，連忙從他身傍閃過，跑到外面喊了幾個茶役來把這病人捉雞似的抬走了。可是，第二天一早便聽說那人巳經被放在「太平間」裏；原來他的頭被汽軍撞傷了，抬到醫院來還沒有十個鐘頭就完結了一生；昨天晚上，因為那病房裏的看護剛剛離開一下，便給他偷偷的走出來了。</p>
<p>做了三年護士，心腸硬得像鐵一樣，有許多人對做護士的總是道樣的批評，其實，據我個人所得的經騐，却並不是如此。譬如我在實習的半年中，可以說簡直沒有好好地吃過一頓飯或安穩地睡過一次覺。不過後來因了無窮盡的生活的煎逼，不山你不做一個「忍人」罷了。</p>
<p>護士的職務是那樣的艱苦，然而所得的待遇却和職務成了個反比例。我在進院六個月之後，每月只領得二元錢的津貼，到了第三年，才增加兩元：畢　以後，照例是要替院裏義務服役三個月，服役期滿，如果院裏能夠繼續雇用你，纔可算是正式護士，但月薪也只有二十四元。</p>

<h3>評方之中的「詩人畫像」</h3>
<p>— 松山</p>
<p>—生活書店經售，定價五角—</p>
<p>一個朋友最近拿來一本「詩人畫像」的短篇小說集，並要我加以批評。這本書的作者是方之中先生，我僅知道方先生的名字，却從未有一面之綠，所以這批評或者是不能深刻而中肯的罷。</p>
<p>我常常有這樣的一種感覺，就是在中國的今日，是最適宜於產生許多描寫社會的黑暗面和帶有反抗性的藝術作品的。不但在詩歌小說上是如此，就在電影和一般的綸畫上也是如此。所以我常常對於中國的電影方面的批評就始終抱着一種偏見，認為一般說來，中國的電影影片，雖然在技巧方面比之歐美資本　，義國家的出品要落後得多，但在意義上說却要好得多。它的通俗和反抗現實的精神，一般的都是那些舶來品所趕不上的。只有那些有拜金迷和色情迷的老爺，太太，少爺，小姐們，才會贊許外國影片而輕視中國影片，在我是連外國影片看都不大愛看的。因為它的大部分都在表現拜金主義的意識，表現粉肉香艷的色情狂愛，完全是用來供那些苟安，沒落的有閒者享樂縱情的玩賞和刺激罷了。自然，在中國的電影近一兩年來也因環境的關係而趨於墮落了，但就在現在也還有些片子包含着描寫社會的黑暗的豐富性。這種原因沒有別的，完全是由於中國的今日，整個的民族都陷於沒有出路和苦悶的絕境中，所以那窮困，受迫害，被犧牲和沒有出路的狀况，正和殘酷的剝削，壓迫，侮辱的事態相並地普遍發展起來，所以那大衆的悲哀和社會的黑暗的題材，那悲憤的情感，是存在在每一個人的心坎中的，牠的宣洩便自然地成為人頻的憤恨與哀嗚的作品。由於這種時代的背景，抓住這種社會的隱痛，表現這種社會的意識的作者，是一般的因此表現出了他們的作品的時代性和其特徵的。在這點上，方之中先生的「詩人畫像」也是具有這種特徵之一部的。比如在這本書中的「捕龜者」的窮困和唯一的生命綫之喪失，還把他們捉將當裏去；「　三司　捕」阿五之被革除，母病而死，女兒被奸，全家　生活之路被斷絕，最後自己也因此　　　殺入而結束了一生：「故鄕剪影　　　自己一家人的生命的牛被貪官提總和劣紳團總拉去：「花家冲」中的選　　　破產與兩個兒子被犧牲於兵　；以　　召租的靈魂」中矮大王的被剝削，　　　嘶力竭猶不能得一飽和　日二毛錢的　薄工資等等，都是一些悲慘的社會現象的描寫。至於「詩人畫像」，「　宮　」和「幽靈的哀嗚」幾篇，也部分　表現出了中國民衆之油然而一生的反帝國（王義情緒　或者　　出了　　主義之殘酷的迫害</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，表現出了為民族爭生存之壯烈的犧牲精神，這都是具有相當意義的。</p>
<p>自然，在作者的描寫手腕方面也有相當的成功，在某些地方也能深刻地體現出故事中的情景和當事人的心理，足以證明作者是具有緻密的想像能力的。而文字的活潑尖銳也同樣證明了作者有相當的表現能力。比如，在「捕龜者」中的捕龜的簡單答話裏，很痛快明顯地表明了牧師們的偽善。在「詩人畫像」裏，他特別用力在寫這主人翁平時雖也怎樣素不過問一切，但在家破人亡之中也逼着他不能不去過問國事，以此警惕着一般對於民族危亡採取隔岸觀火的態度的人們，這也是很正確的。又如在「第三司　捕」中，從李阿五的母親當娘姨時的窮困和被主人發現李阿五而被斥退，到李阿五的失業，女兒失業，母親病危和無力醫治等等，情節都是描寫得很緊張生動的。至於在「召租的靈魂」中描寫矮大五的如何賣氣力，描寫他為了要那一天二毛的工資而發的對話，乃至巡捕還疑他是敲竹槓拿出手鎗來逼着他走，無論是在描寫上和文字的技術的表現上，都算是較好的。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但我們却不能說方先生的作品是完全成功了的。因為他雖能暴露社會的裏面而且具有相當的描寫的能力，但在他的作品中也表現了許多缺點。這些缺點中最重要的是止於在暴露社會的裏面，却缺乏了一種正確的中心思想作支柱，缺乏了一種正確的認識和正確的前途之憧憬的暗示，除了「鐵匠的故事」和「捕龜者」的殺尾稍有表示外，其他幾篇都具有這種缺點。在「詩人的畫像」中，中間雖把素不管事的詩人捲入了鬥爭的塲合，然而最終却把「中國同胞的憤怒到達了爆炸的極度」的想像幻滅化了，並且他自己也以此消失了他的勇氣，失望地讓命運之神把他捉住，以後再看不見他的掙扎活动了。李阿五雖然有他的反抗，可是這反抗僅只成為個人的仇殺。「獵官者」中的黃天問，「幽靈的哀鳴」中的劉玉淸，雖然都走上了正確的道路，然而方先生却把這推動力一則建立在愛情的基礎上，再則建立在純粹風頭主義的英雄思想的基礎上，這是大殺風景的事。在「故鄉的剪影」，「花家冲」的結局中，也都只有屈服和悲哀的後果，這或者只是一些實事的記載，我們可以不必過事苛求。方先生的作品之次一缺點，我們覺得在有些故事中有些勉强。特別在「第三司閣捕」，以買股票作為李阿五入公司的錢索，這不但沒有必要，而且一個拾香烟頭的窮小子，不一定就會有這樣的常識與奢望。並且買二十元的股票就想發財，這也是人人知其不可能的。在「幽靈的哀嗚」中的劉玉淸，平時那樣墮落不堪的頑皮小子，在沒有受過任何朋友之思想上的薰染，就突然轉變得那樣堅强勇敢，這似乎有些不可能，正如周嘯秋之不能因人一駡就轉變好了是一樣的。所以劉玉情這種轉變，至少在作品中是表現出了過於偶然的幼穉氣。</p>
<p>總之，在方先生這部著作中，一方面雖表現出方先生具備有相當的創作天才，但另一方面却表現出方先生是在結構，佈局上缺乏深思和精細的鍜鍊的，特別是太少注意正確的前途的憧憬之暗示，和中心思想的貫注。方先生是一個初出的靑年作者，若能够把握自己的優點去刻苦地深思和用心體念，不必過於求速成，則不是沒有希望的。</p>

<h3>無風樓說聯</h3>
<p>— 熊滄</p>
<p>作聯雖小技，然能吐屬不凡，咳唾皆成珠玉者殊不多覯。劉大白先生說聯語是詩篇的一種，這話我們相當的承認。詩是一種文學技術的最高表現，抒情寫景都有潛在的感動力，足以發人深省。有時聯語的效用同樣的能够達到道境界。白屋聯話有云：「聯語是律體的文字，是備具外形的律聲的文字。它備具整齊律，參差律，次第律，抑揚律，反復律，當對律和重疊律，凡是中國詩篇的外形律，它無一不可以備具。」從此吾人可知聯語與詩之分野了。　　很多人說聯語是律詩的旁枝。律詩的形式具備之後才有聯語的產生。所以聯語也可說是律詩的蛻化。</p>
<p>詩要富於含蓄性，然後才能令人諷誦不厭，聯語與詩旣出一轍，自然也同樣須是極含蓄極雋永而具有詩的旋律的文字。歷來聯語作的多了。但能為人擊節嘆賞的，却是幾首作者不經意中產生的作品。作聯語，我總以為不是可以勉强挖空心思的。繁富的辭藻在聯語的園地上不為我們過分的看重，而輕逸的作品反為我們認作是優良的收穫。但若感事，傷時，弔喪，思昔之作品，則雄沈豪放，亦不失為具有痛快淋漓的意味。</p>
<p>雖然，集句聯也有很別緻的東西的。如翁方綱先生自輓聯曰：「朝聞道，夕死可矣」，「今而後，吾知免夫！」但到底不是作聯的常軌。因為集句聯要典而切，不比創作聯來得活潑自然。有時謠諺俗語，順手拈來，也自有不可及的韻致。製聯有一個最高的原則，就是要「自然」而「貼切」。只要來得自然貼切則雖打情罵俏的俚詞，亦爲無上的佳構。</p>
<p>關於聯語的對稱方法，白屋主人有很好的說明曰：「聯語的特性是形態腔調和意義的兩兩對稱，這是中國所特有的。因為中國的語言是孤立语，没有语尾的变化；中国的文字是單音節，而一個音只有一個形態的；所以作成整齊地對稱的型式。在形態上，兩停或兩組相對，兩停或兩組與間，相當的各個字，大體是用抑音和揚音兩兩相對；至少各停或各組末字的抑揚是很嚴格地必須相對的。在意義上，兩停或兩組相與間，相當的各個位置上，常是取黨義相同的，或相類的，或相反的字，使它兩兩相對。如果不是這樣，那末，一定是在一停或一組中間，自己備具了相對的型式，所以有此例外了。還有一個禁例，是在相對的兩停或兩組間不准有一個重出的字。說得明白點，就是前停或前組已經用過的字，後停或後組不准再用（除有時前後兩停或兩組亦相當的同一位置上同用「之」字之類），至於一停或一組的本身，可以用另一個重出的字去合它相對。不過有些特別的聯語，兩停或兩組間在相當的同一位置上交互地使用重出的字；例如前停或前組的第二個字，重出於後停或後組的第二個字，也重出於前停或前組的第四個字的位置上；這樣交互地重出，也是許可的。總之，聯語是嚴格地使用整齊律和當對律的。」實在製聯欲求其工穩，當使對稱適當，已如上述，而內容的淸新別緻尤為製聯者所當致意。佳聯不乏例子：某處有一橋亭，係旅客來往迎送之地，某撰聯云：「道一聲去也，送別河干，過橋便人天瀝路。盼今日歸哉，迎來道左，握手還疑夢里身。」此聯遣辭自然，而情致動人，足為樸質之代表。</p>
<p>台州有東湖，猶杭州有西湖。出東廓門不過半里，湖光山色與西湖無異，隔以長堤分裹外湖，其外湖有湖心亭，傑閣三　，登臨最勝，俞曲園題一聯云：「好水好山，出東廓不半里而至。宜晴宜雨，比西湖第一樓何如？」此聯亦以質樸見勝，而飄逸瀟洒尤為難能可貴。</p>
<p>某佛刹中塑彌勒，有聯云：「我笑有因眞可笑，你忙無甚為誰忙？」又云：「終日解其　，笑世事紛紜，曾無了局。經年坦乃腹，看胸懷洒落，却是上乘。」</p>
<p>民十八，隨母校敎育參觀遊京，見湘潭吳　題明故宮聯云：一「代明良開國，豐功偉烈，盡付刦灰，惟此軸中畫象，碑上血痕，同古物以保存，瞻覽摩挲，猶深景仰！兩朝建築增華，傑閣重樓，可知勝概，祇今數堵頹垣，幾堆敗瓦，留故宮之名號，低徊往復，無限蒼凉！」大有「白头宫女在，闲坐说玄宗」之慨，又軍次見劉峴莊題滕王閣云：「興廢總關情，看落霞孤騖，秋水長大，幸此地河山無恙。古人纔一瞬，問江上才人，閣中帝子，比當年風景何如？」令人不勝滄桑之感，聯亦遣詞圓活。十九年至岳陽樓，見羅平竇題岳陽樓云：「一樓何奇？杜少陵五言絕唱，范希文兩字關心，滕子京百廢俱興，呂純陽三過此醉；詩邪？儒邪？吏邪？仙邪？前不見古人，使我愴然淚下！諸君試看，洞庭湖南極瀟湘，揚子江北通巫峽，巴陵山西來爽氣，岳州城東看巖疆，瀦者，流者，時者，鎭者，惟此中眞意，問誰領會得來？」是則直將岳陽樓歷史形勢囊括無遺矣。</p>
<p>彭玉麟一生斷訟折獄夙聞威名，其聯語亦有極洒脫者：「憑欄看雲影波光，最好是紅寥花疎，白蘋秋老！把酒對瓊樓玉宇，莫辜負天心月到，水面風來！」又如某君平山堂聯云：「含遠山，吞長江，其西南諸峯，林壑允美。送夕陽，迎素月，當春夏之交，草木際天。亦属靑新之作。板橋畢竟妙人，其題嚴子陵釣台云：「先生何许人？羲王以上。醉翁不在酒，山水之間。」</p>
<p>民間流傳的妙聯亦甚夥，惜無人識其作者的姓名。如：某題黃梁夢亭曰：「睡至二三更时，凡功名都成幻境。想到一百年後，無少長俱是古人。」某题茶亭云：「四大皆空，坐片刻不分你我。兩頭是路，吃一盞各自東西。」某题鄉邨戲台云：「或为君子小人，或爲才子佳人，登場便見。有時歡天喜地，有時驚天動地，轉眼皆空。」</p>
<p>新作家之撰聯語的頗少見，周作人先生有輓三一八被難學生胡錫爵聯云：「什麼世界，還講愛國？如此死法，抵得神仙！郁達夫先生有書齋聯云：「避席畏聞文字獄，著書都為稻粱課。」郭沫若先生在辛亥年後會為其故鄕人編春聯，他當時自認為最得意者為：「桃花春水遍天涯，寄語武陸人，於今可改秦衣服。鐵馬金戈遁地軸，吟詩錦地客，此後休嗟蜀道難。」錄此以存聯語史的資料云爾。</p>

<h3>少女的母性</h3>
<p>— 少雄</p>
<p>孩子失了望，而且他柔弱的心靈裏受了無限的委曲。他想：「人家可有着這東西玩，為什麽我不應該有一個呢？」可是他並沒有把這理由說出口來，他以為這個大人們是應該懂得的。於是他就鳴的一聲哭了起來，用眼淚來示威。哭聲起先是小而緩和，但驟然的大而緊張起來，一面喊着：「我要啦……我要啦！」到這時，大人們纔有些着急了，於是用種種哄騙或威嚇的手段來緩和形勢，有時還不免要以打罵了事。</p>
<p>和別的孩子一樣，這孩子似乎是以哭為內容而生活於其中的。有時在哭泣中經人譬解寬慰而止聲之後，自己去玩耍去了。木已無事了的，但隔不了幾分鐘，不知怎的，大概是想起了剛纔的委曲吧，又舊事重提地鳴的一聲哭了起來。但這樣的哭是沒有眼淚的，弛緩無力的，而且只哭了一聲就停止了。</p>
<p>但雲蓮雖整天在這擾攘和忙亂的包圍中過着生活，對於這兩個小主人可以說從不感到厭倦。固然他們不是她的孩子，然而她却常把潛伏在她心底正待發洩的母愛，很自然地傾注在他們身上。不錯，她是一個可憐的窮苦女子，一個主人的微賤俯僕，一個以勞力為商品的出賣者，可是在這兩個孩子面前，她是顯得和神聖的瑪利亞一樣的神聖。這一個是向上發展的繁富的生命，那兩個是</p>

<p>天真無邪的純潔的靈魂；這一個是充溢着偉大的愛，那兩個是各包容着一顆童心。在這三個人中間，是顯耀着一種和諧的美。</p>
<p>有一天，男主人要帶着大的孩子往街上購買物事，因為這孩子執着要雲蓮作伴，於是她也跟他們一塊兒去。他們走入了一條狹的巷裏。男主人昂然前行，她則挈着孩子隨在背後。有一隻面目猙獰的狗向他們迎面而來；男主人還是不經意地只管向前移着步，但她却覺察到了。她知道這孩子是怕狗的，立刻她把他抱在右臂上，更用左手遮住他的眼睛，怕他見了要受驚。待狗從他們身旁踱過時，她　把左手移開；及至他們穿出了這條狹長的小巷時，她更加寬心了　，遂把抱着的孩子放在地上，依舊牽着手，緊緊地跟住那個和別的男子一樣不大預間孩童的事的男主人走去。</p>
<p>她非常喜歡抱孩子。她旣是一個使女，而照顧小孩又是她唯一的責任，這抱的機會顯然是很多的。除了女主人分担去一部份的責任，以及男主人偶然高興時也把自己的孩子視作玩物般的抱弄　一會之外，通常的時候小的孩子—那大的已不大需要提抱了—不是睡在床上或搖籃裏，便是在雲蓮的懷抱中。孩子抱得過久了，或是抱的次數太多了，她也覺得臂部和肩部是很痠痛的。可是有時候卽使當這小的孩子正安逸地睡在床上，她也常常想去抱他。有時，他已在她的懷中睡熟了，她還是抱着而不把他放在搖籃裏，却帶着一種好奇的心情，怔怔地望着他恬靜平和的睡態。眞的，這孩子嬌小白嫩的面部，在睡着時，似乎比平常更為美麗而可愛了。疏稀的頭髮；淡淡的眉毛；肥圓的兩頰；無力地張着的小嘴，那裹面似乎隱藏着許多非大人們的言語所能形容的神秘；那眼縫是細得不容一髮，像是唯恐那織在眼裏的一顆美麗而甜密的夢失落似的；那頸項的肉是如此地豐滿，使頸部和下巴之間差不多只隔着一錢。她看得出神了，這美麗和神秘打動了她的心，喚起了她潛在而模糊的處女慾望，終於她禁不住地用手去扳一下他的嘴唇，挖一下他的眼皮，並撫摸着他光滑潔白的小手，這手是這樣的柔軟，彷彿小手指一碰就要折斷的樣子，那小指甲更是一塵不染的白得發亮。</p>
<p>常是這樣的，她一見孩子在床上醒來，就立刻懷着欣悅的心情去抱。其實，有好多次，這抱是多事的，因為有時他睡醒了却並不啼哭，這是有重復睡熟的可能的。更有的時候，孩子啜飽了奶，女主人不待他的睡熟，便把他放在床上，他也不啼哭，只是張大着眼，舐着自己的小拳頭，靜靜地仰臥着，但是給雲蓮見了，又走近身去動手抱了。每逢這樣的時候，女主人常要這樣喊住她說：</p>
<p>「不要抱他，讓他睡一忽罷！」</p>
<p>因為女主人是非常地需要着安靜的，她每天除了處理瑣碎的家務之外，還有許多的活計要做。她的丈夫是一家書局的英文部編輯主任，她要助他編譯自修英文叢書，而這些活計又是可以由他丈夫搬到自己家裏做的，這也可以說是一種家庭職業。然而孩子們的糾纏，號哭和喧鬧常使她工作的進展受了阻碍。往往還沒有註釋了五六個英文生字或成語，不是這一個孩子哭着要奶吃，便是那一個孩子大概又和別人家的孩子起了什麽糾紛，從户外號啕大哭着進來。於是她逼得放下筆，問他誰又欺侮他。孩子見了母親，哭得更凶了，一壁斷續地訴說着寃苦，聲音含糊得總要詢問好幾遍，纔審知其中的原委。結果，自然是由母親向他說好話，揩眼淚，一塲公案纔算了結。可是這麽一來，她又給躭誤了不少的工作了。因此，她一方面很深切地愛護他們，一方面又怕他們吵擾，尤其是那大的孩子，撒野作嬌，釀禍滋　事，擾擾攘攘幾無　日，是破壞這家庭的安靜的唯一活動份子。</p>
<p>「短命鬼！你不會死呀！」當女主人向他發狠時，常這樣的罵他，或是說：「你們這般短命鬼！好死不死的！」這是連那渾然無知的小的孩子都波及了，或是連那男主人也包括在內了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Unprecedented in a Century: Disastrous Storm in Wuhan, Destroying Houses, Capsizing Boats, and Causing Many Casualties; Over a Thousand Victims Urgently Need Relief</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Starting at 1 AM on the 18th in Wuhan, there was an extremely strong storm accompanied by rapid thunder and heavy rain. Citywide phone service was cut off, most of the electric lights went out, and people were deeply shaken. It lasted for two hours before subsiding. After investigation, the wind came from the west, its intensity unprecedented in a century. Countless houses and boats were destroyed, and numerous people were injured. There were also many deaths. Entire blocks of residences were left with nothing. Over a thousand victims await relief. The disaster situation in various counties is pending detailed investigation. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Wuhan's weather had been dry and hot for days, like early summer. At 1 AM on the 18th, the weather suddenly changed, with thunder, lightning, violent winds, and torrential rain. The ferocity of the wind was unprecedented in decades. Due to the excessive lightning, the electric company temporarily stopped supplying electricity, plunging the city into a world of darkness during the storm. It gradually subsided at 3:30 AM. The Three Towns (Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang) suffered heavy losses, with hundreds of houses collapsing, dozens of deaths, and hundreds of injuries. Many small boats along the river were capsized. Numerous electric wires and poles were broken. Many neon lights and shop signs of major stores were blown down. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Hankou Public Security Bureau announced the initial report of the disaster caused by the heavy wind and rain on the morning of the 18th: a total of 86 houses collapsed in the city, with 18 deaths from being crushed or electrocuted, and 50 injuries. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Hankou was hit by a severe storm this morning, the worst in many years, causing considerable damage. Many rooftops in the city were blown off, and chimneys, windows, and flagpoles were also damaged. Telephone communication and electricity supply were affected, with power outages lasting several hours. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) An investigation into the Wuhan wind disaster revealed that a total of 3,000 houses collapsed in Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, with 40 to 50 deaths and 300 to 400 injuries, causing enormous losses. Telephone, electricity, and telegraph lines were destroyed but have now been repaired. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador Arrives in Beijing; Second Soviet Reply Still Not Received</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a Havas dispatch from Moscow on the 16th, the Soviet government has drafted a reply to our second protest. However, as of the 18th, relevant parties in Nanjing have not yet received the document. Furthermore, Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 17th. (18th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports state that the Soviet Union has drafted a reply to our second protest regarding the Soviet-Mongolian Mutual Assistance Pact. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received it. Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov has returned to Nanjing from Shanghai and will visit Foreign Minister Zhang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs after the reply arrives. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Quota for National Assembly Representatives; People of the Five Northeastern Provinces Telegraph Request for Increase; Acting Commander Zhang Telegraphs Plea for Accordance with Public Sentiment</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) The quota for representatives to the upcoming National Assembly only allocates 23 seats to the five northeastern provinces and cities. Northeasterners residing in various provinces widely believe that this proportion is inappropriate and have telegraphed the Central Government and the Legislative Yuan successively, requesting an increase in the quota. They have also telegraphed Acting Commander Zhang of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, requesting a special telegram of earnest appeal. Upon receiving the telegram, Acting Commander Zhang telegraphed the Central Government and the Legislative Yuan on the 15th, requesting that they comply with public sentiment and proportionally increase the quota for northeastern representatives. The original telegram is excerpted below: Urgent, To the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, To the Legislative Yuan, Confidential: We have repeatedly received letters and telegrams from Northeasterners residing in various provinces, stating in brief: According to reports, the Legislative Yuan has resolved that the number of representatives for the National Assembly is set at 1,200. The province with the most representatives has 45, and the province with the least has 10. Tibetans, Mongolians, and overseas Chinese each have 40. Our five northeastern provinces and cities only have 23. Upon investigation, the old House of Representatives had a total of 596 members, and the Three Eastern Provinces elected 36. The previous National Assembly had 520 representatives, and the five northeastern provinces and cities elected 31. The total number of representatives this time is more than double the previous amount, yet the northeastern quota has been reduced to 23. The discrepancy is unavoidable. Although the northeastern territories are currently occupied, the entire country has never recognized their loss. Therefore, the allocation of representatives should be based on the actual population of the Northeast. The current quota is only half of that of the province with the most representatives, which seems comparatively insufficient. If it is said that land has been lost and elections are difficult, then Tibetans, Mongolians, and overseas Chinese are also not electing representatives locally. It seems that this cannot be used as a reason to reduce the quota. In addition to jointly submitting a petition to the Central Government, we intend to request a special telegram to earnestly appeal for a proportional increase to appease public expectations and demonstrate fairness. Etc. Thinking back to the Eastern Incident five years ago, the people's hearts yearn for the Han, and their vows to die remain unchanged. Now, with a population of over 34 million in the Northeast, the quota of representatives is less than that of Tibetans, Mongolians, and overseas Chinese. Rationally and emotionally, it is easy to create anxiety. If this matter causes suspicion among our northeastern compatriots, weighing the importance, much will be lost. We implore you to comply with public sentiment, increase the northeastern representatives proportionally, so that they are equal to those of other provinces and cities, strengthen the hearts of our people towards the interior, and achieve the effect of sincere unity. Respectfully submitted by telegram, requesting your consideration. Zhang Xueliang bows, respectfully. Wang Yizhe, Gao Weiyue, Wu Jiaxiang, etc., Northeasterners residing in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, believe that the quota of representatives for the upcoming National Assembly only allocates 23 seats to the five northeastern provinces and cities, considering this proportion inappropriate. They have jointly telegraphed the Central Government and the Legislative Yuan, requesting an increase in the number of representatives. The original telegram is excerpted below: Urgent, To the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang in Nanjing, To the Legislative Yuan, We recently read in the newspapers that the Legislative Yuan has resolved that the number of representatives for the National Assembly is set at 1,200. The province with the most representatives has 45, and the province with the least has 10. Tibetans, Mongolians, and overseas Chinese each have 40. The five northeastern provinces and regions have a total of 23. Upon investigation, the National Assembly is a body representing all the people. The method of allocating representatives should be based on the actual population of each province and city. The population of the five northeastern provinces and cities reaches over 34 million. Although the territory has been occupied, our government has never recognized the puppet organization as valid. Therefore, the more than 34 million people of the Northeast should be treated the same as those of other provinces and cities. However, the proportion of representatives this time is different from that of the previous National Assembly, and the number is even smaller than that of Tibetans, Mongolians, and overseas Chinese. When compared, there is a feeling of being comparatively insufficient. If it is said that the land has been lost and elections are difficult, then Tibetans, Mongolians, and overseas Chinese are also not electing representatives locally. It seems that this cannot be used as a reason to reduce the quota. Yizhe and others reside in Long and Qin (Shaanxi and Gansu), with hearts longing for their homeland. Reading this resolution of the Central Government, we cannot help but express our feelings. We implore you to observe public sentiment and increase the northeastern representatives proportionally, according to the total population, in proportion to other provinces and cities, so as to avoid regrets and demonstrate fairness. We are extremely grateful and expectant. Wang Yizhe, Gao Weiyue, Wu Jiaxiang, Ge Yingbin, Mi Chunlin, Zhou Congzheng, Liu Linpei, Liu Wei, Wang Yuke, Zhao Hongzhu, Zhang Zhengfang, Hong Fang, Gao Yongshan, Wang Baozhong, Ren Zuoji, Lin Changxiang, Gao Shidong, Wang Zhiping, Lu Guangji, Gao Jianguo, Han Liru, Wang Weidan, Zhang Zhizhong, Yang Yuzhen, Wang Jinghuai, Chen Ruiming, Zhang Qianhua, Lin Yaoshan, Wang Jiqiang, Che Qinghe respectfully bow.</p>

<p>(Chengdu) Wu Zhongxin arrived in Chongqing from Guiyang on the 17th and flew to Chengdu by Ford plane at 3 PM on the 18th, staying at the headquarters guest house.

<h3>Foreign Banks in Tianjin Exchanging Silver for Legal Tender; No Method for Approving 5% Interest</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance replied to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that the special envoy stationed in Beiping telegraphed that, according to the British Consul-General in Tianjin, etc., the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, Mercantile Bank of India, China and Japan, Citibank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Deutsche Asiatische Bank, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger, and Banca di Credito Italo-Cinese in Tianjin hold a total of over 4.72 million yuan in silver. They originally intended to transport it to Shanghai to exchange for Chinese legal tender and obtained passports from the Ministry of Finance. However, the Tianjin Customs has not allowed them to be released, so they have not been able to be transported to date. These large amounts of silver cannot circulate in the market or be exchanged for legal tender, which the banks find difficult and inconsistent with the measures set by the Ministry of Finance. It is asked whether the silver currently held by these banks can be handed over in its entirety to the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in Tianjin for collection, in exchange for legal tender, and whether the method of transferring silver by foreign banks in Shanghai, which approves 5% interest for two years for two-thirds of the amount, can be used to comply with laws and regulations and make the methods in Tianjin and Shanghai consistent. Upon investigation, the facts are as described, and the matter should be handled. It is respectfully submitted by telegram for consideration. The case of the Banque Franco-Chinoise in Tianjin being obstructed in transporting silver was previously assisted by the French Chargé d'Affaires, and the reply from the Ministry of Finance stated that the Tianjin Customs had been ordered to handle it in accordance with regulations. Now, these banks are again being obstructed in transporting silver to Shanghai. The British Consul-General in Tianjin has proposed that the silver be handed over in its entirety to the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in Tianjin for collection, in exchange for legal tender. It is asked whether this can be approved and handled. Upon investigation, the Ministry has no record of the Shanghai foreign banks transferring silver and approving 5% interest for two years for two-thirds of the amount, as stated by the British Consul in Tianjin. According to the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in Shanghai, within the deadline for exchanging legal tender on February 4 this year, the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices was significant at that time. Interest was given to various foreign banks exchanging silver coins for legal tender, but only once. Although the Ministry of Finance extended the deadline for exchanging legal tender after February 4, it refers to places where legal tender has not yet circulated smoothly in the interior. This method is no longer applicable to major trading ports, and there should be no more interest given. The Ministry's calculation is the same. If the foreign banks in Tianjin need to exchange their existing silver for legal tender locally, they should be allowed to negotiate with the three banks in Tianjin. The previous consultation is approved. It is respectfully replied for reference and notification. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Arita Visits Prime Minister Hirota; Exchanges Opinions on China Issues; Appointing Kawagoe Considers Military Opinion; Return to Country Order Issued After Our Agreement; General Policy Towards China to be Decided at Four-Province Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Arita visited Prime Minister Hirota at 10 AM on the 18th to exchange important opinions on issues concerning China and Russia. Foreign Minister Arita believes that the Soviet-Mongolian relationship, the Manchurian-Russian border issue, and the North China issue are of great importance to Japan, which is a force for stability in East Asia. He has decided to establish countermeasures and actively implement independent diplomatic policies. Therefore, he met with the Prime Minister to determine fundamental principles, and the specific implementation methods will be discussed with the heads of various departments. Once these fundamental policies are determined, Ambassador Kawagoe will be instructed to carry them with him to his post. At the same time, the personnel inside and outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be refreshed, and the Foreign Minister will clarify the contents at a special session of the Diet. (18th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In order to clarify the new diplomatic policy at the special session of the Diet, Foreign Minister Arita held the second Foreign Ministry leadership meeting at the Foreign Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 18th, conducting important discussions on two issues: (1) Measures to rescue East Asia from the threat of Bolshevization; (2) Fundamental policies for opening up new avenues for Japanese trade and economy. (18th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the Chinese government's reply agreeing to the appointment of Consul-General Kawagoe as Ambassador to China arrives, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will immediately issue an order to Kawagoe to return to the country, providing him with instructions regarding policy toward China. Foreign Minister Arita, recognizing the importance of diplomacy toward China, has consulted with Prime Minister Hirota and will convene a conference of the Foreign Ministry, Army, Navy, and Ministry of Finance to determine general policy toward China and the Nanjing Conference instruction plan for China and Japan, to be given to Ambassador Kawagoe to take to China. (18th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The promotion of Consul-General Kawagoe of Tianjin to the central position of Japanese diplomacy as Ambassador to China is the first personnel change that breaks precedent by Foreign Minister Arita, attracting attention from all sides. At the time of the selection, the military's intentions were given considerable consideration. Regarding the successor to the Ambassador to China, there were several candidates within and outside the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who were given various considerations. Before the decision was made, Foreign Minister Arita consulted with the military regarding the basic tone of policy toward China, and a general consensus was reached. As a result, Consul-General Kawagoe was deemed suitable for implementing the policy, so the decision was made to appoint him. As a result, it is said that future policy toward China will be completely unified between Foreign Minister Arita's hopes and the military. (18th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has agreed to the promotion of Kawagoe to Japanese Ambassador to China, but it will take some time for the procedures to be completed. It is expected that it will be formally announced in two or three days. Kawagoe is 56 years old, from Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan, and graduated from the Tokyo Imperial University Faculty of Law. He has served as Chief of the Third Section of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, First Secretary and Counselor of the Embassy in China, Consul-General in Jilin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou, and is currently the Consul-General in Tianjin. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Tada visited Kawagoe on the morning of the 18th to congratulate him on his promotion and exchange diplomatic opinions. The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin has begun the handover, and the successor will be Nishida, the Consul-General in Jinan. Chen Juesheng hosted a banquet for Kawagoe and others at Ningyuan at noon on the 19th, with fellow students who had studied in Japan accompanying them. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Kawagoe told foreign reporters that he had heard nothing about his appointment as ambassador and only learned about it from the newspapers. Regardless of who is appointed ambassador, he believes that the embassy will definitely move from Shanghai to Nanjing. The embassy building in Nanjing is about to be completed. The North China region is becoming increasingly important. If only Japanese activities are considered in promoting industry, and the result is that China is oppressed, that would be very wrong. If we do not seek to share benefits with China, we cannot truly clarify the situation. His own opinion will not change, whether he returns to Japan or goes to Nanjing, regardless of the region or the person he is dealing with. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Expansion of Japanese Garrison in North China; Will Be Assembled into a Mixed Brigade; Beiping Rotating Troops Opened Tanggu Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) In addition to the 2,800 troops currently stationed in North China, the Japanese army is strengthening its troop strength by drawing 5,000 troops from the 5th, 7th, and 74th Divisions to form a mixed brigade, which will arrive in mid-June. (18th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The expansion of the Japanese garrison in North China will be realized in June. The expansion quota has been set at 5,000 troops. In addition, another 200 or so troops from the Beiping rotating troops passed through Tianjin to Tanggu at 4 PM on the 18th, and they are scheduled to return home by ship on the 19th, joining the troops from Tangshan.

<h3>The Abruptly Deteriorating Italo-Ethiopian War</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Italo-Ethiopian War, having lasted for over five months, has recently shown signs of an abrupt downturn. Since the battle of Amba Aradam at the beginning of last month, the Ethiopian army, despite its brave attacks, suffered heavy losses and was forced to retreat. Subsequently, the Italian army advanced rapidly northward, capturing Gondar and moving westward to the Lake Tana area. They then concentrated their forces southward, seizing Dessie, a crucial stronghold leading to the Ethiopian capital. Simultaneously, in the southern Ethiopian Ogaden region, the Italian forces led by Graziani also advanced with full force, aiming to occupy Harar and Jijiga in the shortest possible time. Regarding the capture of Dessie and the outcome of the battle north of Lake Ashangi, Italian and Ethiopian war reports are inconsistent. The Italian side claims a great victory and the capture of Dessie, while the Ethiopian side denies this, stating that the Ethiopian Emperor's army of 20,000 troops achieved a great victory southwest of Lake Ashangi, killing 2,400 Italian soldiers. Clearly, neither side's war reports can be fully trusted. However, generally speaking, the Italian army currently holds a distinct advantage. If they completely secure and consolidate the Dessie position, the fall of the Ethiopian capital is imminent.</p>
<p>However, we believe that the outcome of the Italo-Ethiopian War cannot be judged solely on the developments on the East African battlefield, but must also consider two other important aspects. Simply put, the Italo-Ethiopian War is being fought on three fronts: a military front in East Africa, a diplomatic front in Geneva, and an economic front within Italy. Therefore, in addition to the situation in East Africa, we should also observe the situation in Geneva and within Italy.</p>
<p>In fact, Ethiopia's failure in the Italo-Ethiopian War is mainly due to shortcomings on the Geneva diplomatic front. The implementation of sanctions against Italy has been halted to a certain extent, and the failure of Germany and Austria to participate has also undermined the sanctions front to some extent. At the same time, Hitler's tearing up of the Locarno Pact has suddenly intensified the situation in Western Europe. The differing attitudes of Britain and France towards Germany have greatly affected the anti-Italian front in Geneva. Therefore, the proposal of the Committee of Thirteen for a truce between Italy and Ethiopia ultimately failed due to Italy's firm rejection. The League of Nations could not tighten sanctions against Italy in accordance with the Covenant, and the Italian army was able to advance towards Ethiopia with all its strength, determined to force a capitulation.</p>
<p>However, although the Ethiopian army in East Africa failed to hold its ground consistently, and the sanctions action in Geneva could not be carried out consistently, the Italian internal economic front has suffered severely during the war. According to a Havas dispatch from Paris on the 13th of this month, Italy's gold reserves are now decreasing by 500 million lire per month. As of recently, the cost of the East African war has exceeded 70 billion lire. It is estimated that the cost of repatriating the Italian army after the end of the East African war will require huge expenditures. The total war expenses will amount to 120 billion lire. We cannot underestimate the painful lessons Italy has learned from obtaining a victory at such a high price. According to a Havas dispatch from London on the 14th, the Rome correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, Grigore, recently published an article stating, "Regardless of who wins or loses the East African war, Italy will inevitably be impoverished, and its export trade will inevitably be insignificant for at least 20 years." The impact of Italy's invasion of Ethiopia on the economic front can be seen from this. We must not ignore the impact of this blow on the internal rule of Italy.</p>
<p>In the current situation, we cannot yet estimate how the Italo-Ethiopian War will end. Italy's hope is, of course, to take advantage of the weakness on the Geneva diplomatic front to intensify its victory on the East African military front in order to conceal its failure on the domestic economic front. However, judging from the Ethiopian Emperor's resolute stance, it is difficult to say whether Italy's hope will be as smooth as desired. On the Ethiopian side, all the weak and small nations of the world, and those who sympathize with them, will give the assessment of "glorious even in defeat."</p>

<h3>Chinese Art Exhibition at the London Museum Features 2,500 Exquisite Treasures</h3>

<p>(London) A man named Omorphopoulos, a famous collector, has a magnificent collection of Chinese art. It was publicly exhibited today at the Victoria Museum, with the opening ceremony officiated by the Chinese Ambassador, Guo Taiqi. He delivered a speech, saying, "The exhibitions held by several governments are often fleeting and cannot last for long. After the public exhibition of Chinese art at Burlington Palace recently, this grand event is being held again. Not only do they reflect each other, but they also make the memory of the last exhibition last for a long time. Now, the various treasures of the country are on their way back home. Although they are not displayed here, Mr. Omorphopoulos's collection can replace them without shame, because its variety is vast, exquisite, and unparalleled, enough to represent the artistic genius of China. It is truly commendable that a person has devoted his life to collecting so many treasures, making him famous throughout the world." Ambassador Guo also said, "What is beautiful is true, and what is true is beautiful. This is a timeless truth that cannot be erased. This is all we know and always know. Political policies are sometimes exhausted, party conflicts may continue to exist, but this saying alone can transcend any dispute, reaching far and wide. This is the only thing that we can take comfort in," he said. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Amidst Sino-US Negotiations, Silver Prices Soar in the London Market Total Purchases Reach 20 Million Ounces Britain Suspicious of Our Restoration of the Silver Standard</h3>
<p>(London) Speculators here, encouraged by the hope of current Sino-US silver issue talks, purchased silver bars today, so spot prices rose 1/8 of a penny, and forward prices rose 1/16. It is estimated today that India purchased a total of 3 million ounces of silver. It is widely believed that the Chinese government is now the main purchaser, and it is estimated that speculators have purchased between 15 million and 20 million ounces. Except for some that have actually been shipped to India, it is generally believed that there are not many real purchasers. Since speculators' demand has been met by genuine sales, the position of the bulls is difficult to maintain for long. Those in charge are very suspicious of the possibility that the outcome of the Sino-US talks could enable China to restore the silver standard at the current prices. This is because China would have to pay 17.5 pence per ounce to repurchase the silver it needs. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A correspondent from the Economic and Financial Communications Agency stationed in New York recently announced that after talks between Chen Guangfu, the general manager of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank of China, and the US authorities, a tripartite agreement has been reached between China, the United States, and Britain, stipulating that Britain and the United States will jointly assist China in maintaining its currency system and helping China solve complex monetary problems. According to well-informed sources, the method is that the United States will continue to purchase silver from China at a price higher than the international market price, so that China can obtain US dollars and gold to adjust foreign exchange rates. However, China must not sell its silver to other buyers in order to prevent fluctuations in the silver market. In Britain, it is planned to lend funds to China so that Chinese banks can increase their foreign exchange reserves. Even if there is a need to sell silver dollars commercially or financially, the injection of pounds will prevent fluctuations. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was heard here today from those in charge that the rise in silver prices in London and New York does not affect the US Treasury Department's silver purchase program. The price increase was caused by speculation in London and Mumbai. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>

The Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, will also attend the banquet.

<h3>Li Wenfan Discusses Provisional Clauses of the Draft Constitution Meeting of the Central Draft Constitution Review Committee</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Wenfan said that the constitution is the fundamental law of the country, and it is of great importance to the future of the country and the welfare of the people.

The Review Committee will probably complete the review of the entire draft constitution today and submit it to the Central Temporary Standing Committee next Monday for approval in principle. It will then be sent to the Legislative Yuan for revisions and amendments to the clauses, with the aim of publishing it as scheduled on May 5th. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Chen Juesheng, Lin Shize, etc. Discuss Anti-Smuggling Measures</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Chen Juesheng, Lin Shize, and the Chief Inspector of Customs, Mr. Halliwell, discussed concrete cooperative measures for anti-smuggling in North China this morning. The new anti-smuggling order from the Ministry of Finance is expected to arrive in Tianjin before the 25th, and all relevant parties are preparing to promulgate it after receiving it. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Smuggling of goods into North China has not decreased slightly, and the smuggling of edible salt out of North China is also extremely rampant. These smugglers are mostly salt smugglers, who originally used small boats and sampans to transport goods secretly for sale to Japan. Now the organization has gradually expanded, and some have also switched to using motorboats or small wheels for towing. The North China Anti-Smuggling Team has stepped up its prevention efforts, but because they come and go unpredictably, it is not easy to completely eliminate them for a while. It has been found that a portion of the customs revenue from salt is provided for indemnity payments and foreign debt guarantees. Since the September 18th Incident, the customs of Northeast China have been seized, and the guarantee has been completely increased on the existing customs. If smuggling is not stopped, customs revenue will not only be directly affected by tax evasion, but also indirectly affected by the reduction in legitimate imports. If this continues, problems will inevitably arise with the guarantee, which is of great importance to the interests of various countries and China's national credit. The Chief Inspector of Customs is quite anxious. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Ninth Anniversary of Establishing the Capital in Nanjing: National Government Held Commemorative Meeting Yesterday; Chairman Lin Speaks on Efforts to Build the Capital; Tour of the Newly Completed National Government Building</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a commemorative meeting at 10:00 AM on the 18th to celebrate the ninth anniversary of establishing the capital in Nanjing. Attendees included Feng Yuxiang, Ye Chucang, Zhang Ji, Deng Jiayan, Huang Fusheng, He Yingqin, Chen Diaoyuan, Zhang Zhijiang, Jiang Zuobin, Huang Musong, Shi Ying, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Zhang Yipeng, Chen Xunyong, Jiao Yitang, Yu Feipeng, Li Wenfan, Wang Qi, Zhang Mojun, Wang Gupan, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and other senior civil and military officials from the National Government and various ministries and departments, totaling over 600 people. After the music was played, Chairman Lin led the attendees in performing the ceremony and delivered a speech. He began by stating that today was the ninth anniversary of the National Government establishing the capital in Nanjing, recalling that the National Government was established in Guangzhou on July 1, 1925. On July 15, 1926, in accordance with the late Premier's will, the Northern Expedition was launched. By September of the same year, the National Revolutionary Army's forces had advanced to the Yangtze River basin. After the Chinese Nationalist Party's purge nine years ago today, the capital was established in Nanjing. At that time, the Northern Government had not yet fallen, the Yellow River basin had not yet been recovered, and the remaining enemy forces continued to shell across the river. Amidst the booming cannons, the National Government faced difficulties and worked hard to build the nation. By 1928, the warlords were eliminated, the country was unified, the military period ended, the five-yuan system was created, and political tutelage was implemented. Time flies, and it has already been nine years. Recalling this day last year, we held the eighth anniversary commemoration here, hoping that all colleagues would revive the spirit of national construction, cooperate fully, and seek progress for the capital. Now, a full year has passed. As we reflect on the past, how many of the capital construction plans that the late Premier instructed us to implement have we achieved, and how many remain unfinished? He then explained the reasons why the late Premier designated Nanjing as the capital, stating that in the late Premier's will, the Premier's capital construction plan was profound and extensive. Its purpose was not only to make Nanjing the national political center and cultural center but also to make Nanjing the national transportation center and economic center. At the same time, it was to make it the first metropolis on the Pacific coast. The Premier wanted to take Nanjing as the capital, in addition to Nanjing being the most suitable place to establish the capital, there are other meanings, which is to make it an important town in national defense, because today China's national defense, sea defense is more important than land defense, the economic essence and cultural center of our country, Most of them are along the Yangtze River and the sea. Nanjing is located in the middle of China's coastline and at the important intersection of the Yangtze River's lower reaches and the sea. Establishing the capital here is enough to show the nation-building spirit of our nation. Thirdly, he said that the capital construction undertakings, such as water and electricity transportation, have made great progress. Most of the main roads have been completed. The population has increased from more than 200,000 to more than one million. Education, health, and various public undertakings are developing day by day. The construction of the mausoleum area is roughly scaled, and many trees have been planted. In a few years, forests will be everywhere. At the same time, the national railway lines, highways, and various transportation constructions centered on Nanjing are all making progress amidst difficult work and material shortages, making the connection between the central government and various provinces more agile than before. But compared with the Premier's plan, it is still far behind. Compared with the capitals of other countries in the world, there are still shortcomings, so we still need to work harder. At the same time, we must pay more attention to the prosperity and stability of the capital. It is not just the luck of a local part of Nanjing. Its importance has a great relationship with the prosperity and decline of China's national fortune and the peace of the Far East. If the rural areas go bankrupt and the four seas are in poverty, the capital will never be prosperous alone. If there are many incidents in the border areas and the bandits in Jin, Shaanxi, and Sichuan provinces are not suppressed, the capital will never be able to celebrate stability alone. Since ancient times, it has been said that adversity makes a nation strong. We hope that the past national disasters have reached the limit. Extremes beget opposites. We should uphold the late Premier's will, continue the spirit of establishing the capital in Nanjing in those years, work hard, and consolidate the foundation of the country. Finally, he quoted the "Tian Bao" chapter of the Book of Songs to wish the Republic of China a long life. The speech ended at 10:30 AM, and after the ceremony, the National Government officials invited the participants to visit the newly completed National Government building. The staff of the National Government's civil, military, and accounting offices also scheduled gatherings at the government in the afternoon to celebrate. (18th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Legislative Yuan Reviews Draft Law on Mediation of Rent Disputes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the draft law on mediation of rent disputes, the Legislative Yuan's Legislative and Land Committees appointed three members, including Yao Chuanfa, to conduct a preliminary review. On the morning of the 18th, relevant agencies were invited to send representatives to the Yuan to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. After consultation, it was generally agreed that the drafting of the law on mediation of rent disputes took place before the implementation of the Land Law. Now that the Land Law has been implemented on March 1, the issue of setting standard house rents can be handled by citing Article 162 of the Land Law. The Civil Procedure Law also has provisions on mediation of rent disputes. It seems unnecessary to separately create a law on mediation of rent disputes. A draft review report will be submitted to the two committees for review and then to the Yuan for deliberation. (18th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Spanish General Strike Ends; State of Alert Extended for Thirty Days; 200 Fascists Arrested; Many Security Force Officers Also Apprehended</h3>
<p>Madrid The general strike was officially declared over at midnight yesterday. Police arrested fascist leaders throughout the country. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid After the General Confederation of Labor (CGT) announced a general strike, the situation in the capital remained calm. Police conducted searches of the residences of many residents and discovered that many members of the fascist organization "Falange" were privately hiding weapons. They were immediately arrested and handed over to the "Emergency Court" for processing. The cabinet recently ordered an extension of the state of alert by thirty days because the original deadline was approaching. (18th, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid The government, due to the tense situation caused by the Labour Front's resistance to the Fascist Party, has resolved to extend the current state of alert by 30 days. When the Labour Front declared a 24-hour strike, demanding that the government take drastic action against the Fascist Party, a total of 225 troublemakers were arrested, including 200 Fascist Party members and the rest members of the National Guard. At the same time, many National Guard commanders have been replaced. The general strike ended at midnight. Although there were many riots, none were of a serious nature. This is sufficient proof of the strength of the far-left party and the Communist Party. The government, fearing that the general strike would be extended indefinitely, had approved many of the demands made by the extremists, including the arrest of Fascist Party members and the changing of the National Guard commanders. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid After the General Confederation of Labor announced the general strike, Vidal, secretary of the executive committee of the Socialist Party, immediately declared that the CGT had announced the strike to protest against the Fascists who took the opportunity to cause trouble during the funeral of Lieutenant Leffler of the security forces yesterday. The general strike movement may end at midnight today, he said. Furthermore, yesterday, during the funeral of Lieutenant Leffler, some officers of the security forces and the army violated the orders of the Minister of the Army and participated without permission, which was one of the reasons for the CGT's dissatisfaction. The authorities have now arrested those officers. In addition, Marol, the director of the National Investigation Team, and Levas, a senior police officer in the Police Department, were dismissed by the government for failing to maintain law and order.

<h3>French Election Campaign: No Fewer Than 5,000 Competitors</h3>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today that no fewer than 5,000 people are competing for the 614 seats in the Chamber of Deputies election to be held on April 26. The number of political parties in France is evident from this. However, the real competition is only between the People's Front and the National Front. The People's Front includes the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and most of the Radical Socialist Party, while the National Front is composed of the Central Party and the Right Party. Each party now takes peace, patriotism, and prosperity as its three major banners. The difference lies in the means to achieve the above three goals. The right-wing trusts in armed forces and the power of heavy industry prosperity, while the left-wing trusts in the League of Nations, jobs for everyone, and the nationalization of industry and banking. In fact, the first round of voting may not have a decisive outcome, and a second round of voting is bound to be held on May 3. Therefore, the atmosphere is not yet tense. It is generally believed that this Chamber of Deputies election may have a slight shift to the left, and the Radical Socialist Party, which has long held a pivotal position, may have its power split by the Socialist Party and the Central Party. However, in any case, France's attitude towards major international issues will not be affected by a slight shift in power, because the French people now unanimously demand protection from unwarranted foreign attacks and the freedom to live and work in peace.

<h3>British Budget Expenses Increased by 19 Million Pounds; National Defense Costs Still Require More Than 22 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>(London) Next Tuesday, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will present the budget to the House of Commons. It is generally believed that the Chancellor does not want to make any drastic changes to the current tax base. This is further believed because the Chancellor must inform his cabinet colleagues of the contents of the budget until next Monday. Therefore, although the day of the budget presentation is approaching, the public is still indifferent to it. The large increase in national defense spending has made any major tax cuts impossible, but industry has seen great prosperity in recent years. The Chancellor will be able to raise funds for the large increase in spending from increased national tax revenue. Budget spending will reach 772 million pounds, an increase of 19 million pounds compared to last year. In addition, a supplementary national defense budget of approximately 22.2 million pounds will have to be submitted within twelve months, which will be raised by Treasury bills or the issuance of national defense bonds. According to the Chancellor's estimate last year, national income may increase by 46 million pounds. If this prediction is correct, it will not be difficult to cope with the increased national expenses without having to collect new taxes to raise these funds. (16th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Thirteen-Nation Committee Announces Failure of Italian-Ethiopian Mediation; Speeding up Sanctions Postponed for Discussion; League of Nations Administrative Council to Meet Tomorrow</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Thirteen-Nation Committee today formally announced that the mediation of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has failed. The committee is now unable to continue the peace talks and has decided to convene a meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council to deal with the crisis. The League of Nations Administrative Council is now scheduled to meet next Monday. (17th, National News Agency)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee's decision that the mediation of the East African War has failed is extremely important, as the committee was entrusted by the Eighteen-Nation Committee, the full committee on sanctions against Italy, to discuss a peaceful resolution to the Italian-Ethiopian War. Now that it has admitted the failure of mediation, it must return the entrusted mandate to the Eighteen-Nation Committee, and the Eighteen-Nation Committee must now consider the sanctions against Italy under Article 16 of the League of Nations. Oil embargoes and even military plans will now be at the forefront. The Chairman of the Thirteen-Nation Committee, Madariaga, will submit his report to the Eighteen-Nation Committee today and will present it at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting at 10:30 AM on Sunday. It is expected that this Administrative Council meeting will be very important. In addition to recording the failure of mediation, it must also consider the report of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on the progress of sanctions. The convening of the Eighteen-Nation Committee will clearly be decided by the Administrative Council. Large scale postponements until after the French general election will be in effect. (18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the representatives of the countries of the Thirteen-Nation Committee, including British Foreign Secretary Eden, have agreed that the convening date of the Eighteen-Nation Committee should be postponed as much as possible, even until after the French parliamentary elections (scheduled for April 26 and May 3). During this period, Vasconcelos, the chairman of the committee, will submit a written report on the current situation to the representatives of the countries participating in the committee and will appoint a committee of experts to review the effectiveness of the current sanctions. This committee of experts will meet in the middle of next week. According to this agency's reporter, the postponement of the Eighteen-Nation Committee was the result of talks between British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Minister Without Portfolio Peng Gu.

<h3>League of Nations Outside Contact, Situation More Optimistic, Thirteen-Nation Committee to Draft Report</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After the League of Nations Administrative Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee failed to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, it decided yesterday to submit a report on the situation to the Administrative Council. The chief representatives of the countries concerned continued their activities this morning, and the situation is now more optimistic. The committee rejected yesterday all measures that could cause adverse reactions in Europe, and Britain and France are also making every effort to reach a mutual understanding. League of Nations personnel believe that this will greatly clarify the atmosphere here. According to what our correspondent has learned, the representatives of various countries discussed not only the Italo-Ethiopian dispute but also the general situation in Europe during their talks this morning, especially the Rhine issue. French Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu met with Soviet representative, i.e., the country's ambassador to France, Botanin, Romanian representative Antoniate, and Polish representative Komarnicki. Committee Chairman Madariaga, with the assistance of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, has completed the draft of the report and will submit it to the committee for review this afternoon and then to the Administrative Council next Monday. This report is a brief account of how the committee has carried out the tasks entrusted to it by the Administrative Council (i.e., to monitor the development of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute and seek solutions at any time). The content is nothing more than three points: The Thirteen-Nation Committee sent a note to the two warring countries on March 3, inviting them to participate in peace talks. After Italy and Ethiopia accepted the invitation one after another, the Thirteen-Nation Committee met in London on March 23 and decided to entrust Madariaga to work with League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to mediate between Italy and Ethiopia. The process and reasons for the failure of the two to talk with the representatives of the parties concerned, but the report will omit the issue of responsibility for the failure of the talks and the consequences that may arise. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations Administrative Council continued its meeting this afternoon and acknowledged that the committee's reconciliation efforts to resolve the Italo-Ethiopian dispute had failed. It was also decided to submit a report on the discussions to the Administrative Council. This report will be drafted by the committee at its final meeting tomorrow and then submitted to the Administrative Council for review. According to what our correspondent has learned, the above resolution was advocated by French Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu. British Foreign Secretary Eden had previously stated that if the reconciliation efforts failed, the subsequent steps could be taken in one of two ways: either immediately convene the Eighteen-Nation Committee to discuss the issue of intensifying sanctions, or submit an application to the Administrative Council. Peng Gu's current proposal is the second method, which the Thirteen-Nation Committee has decided to follow. The Administrative Council is now scheduled to meet at 10:30 am next Monday, when Committee Chairman Madariaga will attend to report the failure publicly so that the two parties concerned, Italy and Ethiopia, can formally present their views to the Administrative Council and let world opinion judge the merits of the case. Other countries concerned can also take this opportunity to express their position. The Administrative Council will pass a resolution after the discussion is over, but it is unknown whether this resolution will only record the fact that the negotiations have failed and appeal to the two warring countries again to maintain peace, while postponing the implementation of intensified sanctions, or decide to postpone the meeting temporarily so that the governments of the countries concerned can reconsider the situation during the postponement period. According to what our correspondent has learned, although the reconciliation efforts of the Thirteen-Nation Committee have failed, the future is quite optimistic in terms of the cooperation of the member states of the League of Nations, because all countries seem to advocate that the handling of the Italo-Ethiopian dispute should be adapted to the needs of the European situation. British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Minister without Portfolio Peng Gu have recently issued statements to the press, praising each other's spirit of mutual understanding. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the League of Nations Administrative Council's Thirteen-Nation Committee failed to mediate the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, well-known reporter Madame Tabouis recently published a commentary in the L'Œuvre, saying, "Although the mediation efforts of the Thirteen-Nation Committee have failed, there is one result that is still commendable. In other words, the current relationship between Britain and France has now improved, and the proposal to intensify sanctions against Italy is enough to cause friction between Britain and France. As for forcing Italy to stop the war, only military sanctions can be effective. British Foreign Secretary Eden is fully aware of all these points and should also make the British government understand them. This is the so-called result. At that time, if the British cabinet can accept this idea, the Administrative Council of the League of Nations may pass a resolution at its meeting next Monday to record the failure of the Thirteen-Nation Committee's mediation. On the contrary, if the British cabinet instructs Eden to adopt a positive policy, Eden will certainly demand that the Administrative Council of the League of Nations intensify sanctions, including the oil embargo, until a fair solution to the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is reached. However, people with good sources of information here still do not know what attitude the British cabinet will take." (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>Ethiopia Submits Note to League of Nations, Accusing It of Delaying Sanctions, and Protesting Italian Aircraft Bombing Ethiopian Capital</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa The Ethiopian Emperor sent a note to the League of Nations, accusing the member states of the League of Nations of delaying the implementation of effective sanctions against Italy and demanding the immediate implementation of a plan to end the Italian aggression. The note stated that Ethiopia had waited patiently for seven months in the hope that the League of Nations would implement a plan to end the Italian aggression, but this hope had turned into a dream. He asked whether the principle of collective security had now become a mere formality. However, Ethiopia still has the determination to expel the invaders from its territory and firmly and formally invoked the rights it should have as a member state of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations has recently published the full text of the last note from the Ethiopian delegation (i.e., the note rejecting the conditions proposed by Italy), stating that Italy opposes the participation of the League of Nations in future peace negotiations and only allows it to be notified of the progress from time to time. This claim does not help the situation. Ethiopia reiterates that it is prepared to negotiate within the framework of the League of Nations and in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, but Italy is unwilling to do so. This should be recorded by the Thirteen-Nation Committee and all sanctions should be implemented as soon as possible, without further delay. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently received a telegram from the Ethiopian government stating that two Italian bomber planes flew over the Ethiopian capital at 8:00 am this morning and fired several machine guns.

<h3>League of Nations Mediation Fails, Italy Not Surprised, Attitude Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Rome) The reconciliation efforts of the Thirteen-Nation Committee of the League of Nations have failed. Italian financiers are unwilling to comment on this news. People in political circles were not expecting the League of Nations' reconciliation efforts to succeed, so they are not surprised. Italy's position is unchanged at this time. Its military operations in Ethiopia will continue to advance, and General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force, will be ordered to occupy Addis Ababa as soon as possible. People in political circles pointed out that the Italian navy and army have taken all necessary measures so that Italy can respond if something happens in Europe and Italy is attacked. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to the authorities here, there are now three difficulties in the reconciliation between Italy and Ethiopia: Military operations cannot be ordered to stop until the victor has reached a strategically important place. Since the Ethiopian Emperor has lost his whereabouts, Ethiopia has no one in power who can start peace negotiations. Italy cannot start negotiations under the threat of sanctions.

<p>(London) It was learned today that fierce fighting broke out on the southern front in Ethiopia, and the Italian army is making rapid progress. (National Telegraph on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is widely rumored here that the Italian army on the southern front has occupied the city of Harar in Ethiopia, and the war on this front will soon come to an end. Harar is located between the Ethiopian capital and the French port of Djibouti, near the railway line, which is also Ethiopia's gateway to the sea. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Asmara The Italian army headquarters moved to Taesi today, located at the old site of the Ethiopian army headquarters, and began to build a very large radio station near the former imperial palace. Telephones are now in use in the occupied cities in northern Ethiopia. In addition to the staff officers, a large number of artillery units and transport vehicles arrived in Taesi. (National Telegraph on the 17th)</p>
<p>Taesi Preparations are now being made here to await the arrival of the Italian army staff officers tonight. The Italian army will soon invade Addis Ababa. The Elite Artillery Corps arrived today, followed by more than a hundred motorized vehicles. It is expected that the Italian army will reach Addis Ababa within three days once it starts moving forward. In recent days, the engineers in the Italian army have been very busy and have built a high-powered radio station in Taesi. Taesi and the towns in Ethiopia occupied by the Italian army can now communicate with each other by telephone. Outposts have advanced on the road to Addis Ababa southwest of Taesi. It is reported that no enemy troops have been found to be gathered and no signs of resistance have been seen. According to the latest news, the Seventh Army has occupied the Baratha Plain west of Lake Tana. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa The Italian army on the northern front is consolidating its position in Taesi in preparation for an attack on Addis Ababa. The Italian army on the southern front is reportedly being hampered by heavy rain. Although Rome has said that fierce battles have taken place on the Harar and Daga Hamodu roads, the Italian army has not been able to move on this front. Nasibu, commander-in-chief of the Ethiopian army on the southern front, and Turkish advisor Zhang Xibai are now building a Hindenburg line. According to Ethiopians, the latest methods are now being used to build battle lines on the three main roads. Another line has been built before Tsitsiga and Harar in order to protect the road to British Somaliland, which is now Ethiopia's main route for importing military supplies. Ethiopia has recently purchased many anti-tank guns and will resist the advance of the Italian army on the southern front. However, the real crisis in Ethiopia is the attack on its rear by the Italian army on the northern front. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa A cabinet meeting was held here yesterday, but all resolutions were not announced. It is very difficult to understand the true situation on the northern front. On the surface, it seems that the Ethiopian army has made a large-scale troop movement to increase its defense. Reports from the southern front said that the Italian side has launched a new offensive, and contact has been made at several points on the front line. (National Telegraph on the 18th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa People in charge here said that the rumors in Rome that the Ethiopian Emperor had died or that the Ethiopian Emperor had abdicated and would be succeeded by his son are completely unfounded. The Ethiopian government is still in daily communication with the Ethiopian Emperor. According to a British eyewitness, after the Ethiopian Crown Prince saw that the situation was not good after the Italian army's Filipino soldiers climbed the mountain and occupied a strong defensive position, he retreated from Taesi. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Rome) There is a shocking rumor here that the Ethiopian Emperor was killed while leading his troops out of Guarran. The Crown Prince, who opposes his father's anti-Italian policy, is now preparing to negotiate peace with the Italian side and ascend the throne. Although the rumor that the Italian army has occupied Harar has not been confirmed, it is said that General Graziani's troops, commander of the Italian army on the southern front, are advancing in two directions along the Harar and Daga Hamodu roads. It is also said that the troops on this second road are now fighting fiercely and intend to break through the defensive position held by the Ethiopian army. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Italian Artillery Continues to Be Shipped to East Africa, Concentrated in Various Ports in Italian Territory</h3>
<p>(Rome) A large amount of Italian military supplies continues to be shipped to East Africa. Artillery is the most numerous of these military supplies. The number of transport ships sailing to East Africa is increasing every day. Two ships sailed from Naples today, each carrying more than a thousand artillery pieces. In addition, there are various firearms and other military supplies. Several divisions of artillery are said to have boarded ships from Trieste and other ports and sailed to the front line. The concentration of artillery has attracted much attention here, because this kind of sharp weapon has not been used in the war in East Africa so far. People in political circles believe that the destination of these sharp weapons is various ports in Italian territory for reinforcement. (National Telegraph on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Issue of Restoring Military Preparations in Turkish Straits, Soviet Russia Expresses Approval in Reply</h3>
<p>Angora It is widely rumored in Athens that Turkish troops have entered the demilitarized zones of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. The semi-official news agency Anatolia has denied this. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Athens Government sources have received reports that the Turkish government has sent troops into the demilitarized zones of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Athens According to a report from the Athens News Agency, Prime Minister Metaxas recently stated that the claim that Turkish troops have entered the demilitarized zones of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits did not originate from the Turkish capital. The Turkish government has stated that this issue should be handled by the Administrative Council of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Angora According to reliable sources, the cabinet recently held a meeting and decided to send troops to garrison the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. According to rumors, the troops entered the Straits area on the evening of the 16th of this month. However, this has been denied by the semi-official Anatolia News Agency. According to the Treaty of Sèvres after the European War and the Treaty of Lausanne after the Greco-Turkish War, the banks of the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits are demilitarized zones. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) On the 11th of this month, the Turkish government sent a note to the signatory countries of the Treaty of Lausanne (Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Greece, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria) and other countries concerned, requesting that Article 18 of the treaty, which deals with the abolition of military preparations in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits, be amended. Foreign Minister Litvinov recently submitted a reply to Turkish Ambassador Vasif. It is reported that the content is that the Soviet government has no objection to Turkey's intention, but requests Turkey to provide a guarantee that Soviet fleets will be allowed to pass freely through the two straits. It is generally expected that Turkey will provide a satisfactory response to this request. A senior official recently stated that the relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey has always been strong, and if the friendship between the two countries can be maintained, the issue of re-fortifying the Straits area will not cause any harm to Russia. People in political circles are not surprised by Turkey's request for two reasons: The Soviet Union did not participate in the Treaty of Lausanne, and the Soviet Union has always maintained that Turkey should enjoy full sovereignty over the Straits area. Once the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits are re-fortified, they will become the Soviet Union's foremost line of defense, which the Soviet Union welcomes. (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) As soon as the rumor that Turkish troops had violated the Dardanelles Convention and entered the Straits area spread, the Turkish semi-official news agency issued a denial, stating that the claim was absolutely unfounded. The Cabinet Council of Ten Nations held a cabinet meeting this week. The rumor that Turkish troops had entered the Straits area was transmitted from Ankara to Istanbul and then to Paris. Although the French newspapers reported the news, they considered it not entirely credible. According to this rumor, at a cabinet meeting held by Turkey on April 15, presided over by President Kemal, it was decided to occupy the Straits area with military force and station troops there. Last night, Turkish troops had entered this forbidden area. People in London considered this news to be suspicious, because Turkey was requesting to amend the Dardanelles Convention and the countries concerned had agreed to give it sympathetic consideration. Britain sent out a reply today, advising it to raise this issue in a proper form. Therefore, Turkey may not have taken this surprising action so quickly. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in North China Rotate, Construct Barracks and Airfields in Dongjuzi, Attempting to Make It a Permanent Air and Land Force Base</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch Japanese troops in various parts of North China, about 800 of whom belonged to the 1st Division, have reached the end of their tour of duty. On the 13th of this month, they were rotated. The new troops belonged to the Fukuyama Regiment of the 5th Hiroshima Division, about 800 in total. 600 of them arrived at Tanggu on the morning of the 12th on the Japanese military vessel Hongjian Maru and disembarked. They boarded two special trains on the Beijing-Ningbo Railway. About 250 went to Beiping and 250 went to Tangshan and Qian'an County. When the troops going to Beiping passed through Tianjin, Japanese Commander Tada, along with Gendarmerie Commander Ike, Staff Officer Nakai, and Adjutant Kami, went to the station to comfort them and give a speech. The troops going to Tangshan were comforted by Staff Officer Ishii on behalf of Tada. The new Japanese troops in the Third Area of Tianjin and Tangshan all took over their defenses on the same day. The troops rotating in Beiping, Tangshan, and Qian'an County are scheduled to leave China on the 18th, board trains and gather at Tanggu, and take a military vessel to Dalian, and then go to the Northeast to reinforce the defenses. About 200 troops from the 5th Division are expected to arrive in Qinhuangdao on the 17th and disembark there and go to the Changli garrison to be stationed. The total number of Japanese troops stationed in North China is more than 1,800. Only a quarter of them have been rotated. Most of them will be rotated after the troop strength is reinforced in May and June this year. At present, the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters is keeping the reinforced troop strength and the names of the commanders secret. However, it is almost certain that the number of troops will be 8,000, organized into a mixed brigade. Regarding the reason for the troop increase, the Tianjin Japanese Garrison Headquarters will</p>
<p>Regarding the reason for the troop increase, there was a rumor that the commander would be a lieutenant general. It is also a certainty that Tada will remain in his position and be promoted to lieutenant general. Chief of Staff Nagami may also be promoted to major general at the same time. Therefore, there is hope that he will be reappointed. The issue of barracks related to the reinforcement of troops, which the Japanese side was quite worried about before, has recently been resolved. That is, 1,300 mu of land in Liming Village, Dongjuzi, Tianjin, will be occupied to build magnificent barracks. This place was once occupied by the Japanese side as an airfield last year, but the construction was subsequently removed. Now, it has been occupied again. They claim to be giving compensation for the land, but it has not been paid yet. 800 mu of the land belonged to former Governor Li Chun, 500 mu belonged to the Beijing-Ningbo Railway, and more than 40 mu belonged to the people. In addition, there is still nearly 1,000 mu of empty land at the northern end of that section, which the Japanese side is still planning to occupy and build a firewood airfield, combining the area into an air and land base. More than 1,000 workers have been mobilized, about 20 Japanese people are supervising the work, more than 100 large carts are transporting bricks and earth, and more than 10 trucks are transporting materials. The construction is progressing very actively. It is said that the total cost of the project is 400,000 yuan, and the Hongji Company has contracted to build it, with a deadline of five months. In addition to the 500,000 bricks stored in the Japanese barracks at Haiguang Temple, which have been transported to be used, 2.5 million bricks have been purchased from the Tianlong Shengxing brick kilns in Dongjuzi and 2.5 million bricks have been purchased from the Rongxing brick kilns in Xiyingmen. It is easy to imagine how many houses will be built from this alone.</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese side has also set up an aviation branch in the Japanese concession in Tianjin, and appointed Yamaguchi Masao as the director, specializing in handling aviation liaison between China and foreign countries. Since January, one or two Japanese military planes have flown in daily from foreign countries, carrying mail or passengers, or sometimes carrying Japanese military officers to inspect various places. They all use our China Aviation Corporation airfield in Dongjuzi for their flights. The planes that arrive daily are "127", "128", "129", "132", "130", "140", "502", and "504". Each time they land, people from the Japanese military headquarters go to take care of the passengers and mail. In effect, they have opened up an air route themselves and are using it for regular airmail. (16th)</p>
<h3>Gansu Province Storage Regulates Northwest Grain, Decides on Five Implementation Measures, Focuses on Activating the Rural Economy</h3>
<p>Lanzhou Dispatch The government previously received an instruction from the Military Commission to draft measures to regulate grain in the Northwest. After 391 provincial meetings, it was decided that the Department of Civil Affairs and the Gansu Branch of the Farmers Bank would discuss the matter. Five measures have now been drafted and submitted to the 399th provincial meeting for discussion. It was decided to follow them. The measures are as follows: Based on the actual situation in this province, such as whether or not to establish a grain management bureau,</p>
<p>Because the finances do not allow it, even if it is reluctantly established, it is feared that it will only waste money. This province has always been known for its barren land, and the fertile areas are mostly used for tobacco fields. If we want to regulate grain, we must first effectively promote grain production, and then regulation will be effective. However, the money from tobacco fields in this province has always been allocated for military expenses. If military expenses are not available, it will be impossible to expand the area where tobacco cultivation is prohibited. If it is impossible to expand the area where tobacco cultivation is prohibited, then there will be no way to replenish grain, and there will be no way to achieve fundamental regulation of grain. Therefore, in order to effectively regulate grain, we must find ways to expand the area where tobacco cultivation is prohibited and shorten the time limit for prohibiting tobacco cultivation. Promote the organization of rural credit cooperatives and implement loans to provide financial relief to rural areas. Establish warehouses to relieve the economic difficulties of farmers and to concentrate grain. Run grain transportation and sales cooperatives to regulate</p>
<h3>Shandong Province: The Rising Yellow River Water Levels Cause Concern. The Ice Flood Level is Only Slightly Lower Than the Major Flood Level. There is No Guarantee Whether This Year's Major Flood Will Be Safe.</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River is the Only Major Disaster in North China. Shandong Province is Located in the Lower Reaches. The River Flows Through Areas Starting from Pu Prefecture, Passing Through More Than Twenty Counties, and Entering the Sea at Lijin. There are Numerous Risky Embankments Along the Banks, Which are Very Precarious. Recently, Just as the Breach Was Blocked, News of the Ice Flood Arrived. Judging from the Situation, There is No Guarantee Whether a Breach Can be Avoided During this Year's Major Flood. According to the Yellow River's Annual Flood Period, There are Three Stages: the Ice Flood, the Peach Blossom Flood, and the Major Flood. The Ice Flood and Peach Blossom Flood are Both Very Short in Duration and Easier to Prevent. However, During the Major Flood, the Water Level is High and the Duration is Long. Every Year During the Transition from Summer to Autumn, the Floodwaters from Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces in the Upper Reaches are Like a Released Flood, Rushing Down Thousands of Miles, Making Prevention Difficult and Often Leading to Breaches. In Shandong Province, After the Breach at Gongjiaba in Lijin in the Lower Reaches, Another Breach Occurred at Lisheng Village in the Upper Reaches in 1925, Flooding Various Counties in Western Shandong. In Recent Years, Breaches Have Occurred in the Changyuan Area of Hebei Province Every Year. Last Year, a Breach Occurred Again at Jingzhuang in Dong'a County, Shandong Province, Flooding Western Shandong and Northern Jiangsu, Shaking the Nation. Although the Breach Has Now Been Blocked and the Closure Work Completed, News Has Arrived that the Peach Blossom Flood Season is Approaching. Melting Snow from Areas Such as Suiyuan and Baotou is Rushing Downstream into Shandong, Causing Shandong's River Works to Enter a Serious State Again. On the 14th, the Water Level at Kangtun and Zhukou in the Upper Reaches of Shandong Suddenly Rose by More Than One Meter. The Water Level at Lisheng Village Even Reached 58.5 Inches, Which is Startling. In Previous Years, the Peach Blossom Flood Has Never Seen Such High Water Levels. The Water Level is Only 9.2 Inches Lower Than the Major Flood in 1931. It is Recorded that the Highest Water Level at Lisheng Village in 1931 Was 57.41 Meters, the Highest Water Level in 1932 Was 57.28 Meters, the Highest Water Level in 1933 Was 57.1 Meters, the Highest Water Level in 1934 Was 57.6 Inches, and the Highest Water Level in 1935 Was 56.8 Inches. The Water Levels in 1933 and 1934 Cannot be Relied Upon Because the Breach at Changyuan Had Not Yet Been Blocked. The Difference Between the Water Level in 1931 and This Year's Peach Blossom Flood is More Than 7 Inches. As for the Water Level During the Major Flood, the Highest Water Level in 1931 Was 58.67 Meters, the Highest Water Level in 1932 Was 58.38 Meters. In 1933, the Breach at Changyuan Occurred Again, and the Water Level at Lisheng Village Was Mimicked at 58.5 Inches. The Water Level in 1935 Was 59.15 Inches. By Comparison, the Maximum Water Level During the Current Peach Blossom Flood is Only About One Meter Lower. This Phenomenon is All Due to the Silt Accumulation in the River, the Rising Riverbed, and the Silt Accumulation at the River's Mouth, Which Impedes Discharge. If Plans are Not Made Quickly, When the Major Flood Arrives and the Water Level Rises, There is a Fear that Another Breach May Occur, Making it Difficult to Avoid. (16th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Dingcheng's Bandit Gang Infests the Fujian-Guangdong Border Area; Fujian and Guangdong Troops are Currently Engaged in Joint Suppression</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Pseudo-Western Fujian Red Army, the Eighth and Ninth Army Corps, Led by Zhang Dingcheng and Qiu Jinsheng, Consisting of Approximately 500 to 600 Bandits, Were Heavily Suppressed by the Suppression Troops in Yongding and Found it Difficult to Maintain a Foothold. In Mid-Last Month, They Fled from the Jinfeng and Xiayang Areas of Yongding County into Pinghe County. They Attacked and Captured Xianghu Mountain Village in Pudong, Close to the Guangdong Border. The Populace in Areas East of Dabu, such as Yanshang and Dachang, Were Greatly Alarmed.

Chen's Regiment, Stationed in Pudong, Once Received Orders to Enter Pinghe County to Assist the Local Central Army in a Joint Encirclement of Xianghu Mountain. Zhang's Bandits Adopted a Strategy of Avoiding Strength and Attacking Weakness, Retreating to the Mountains in the Daluo Peak Area Bordering Pinghe and Yongding. Because of the Lack of Food, They Often Split Up and Fled to the Borders of Pinghe and Dabu, and the Jinfeng Village Area of Yongding to Plunder and Rob. In Yantian, Chishu Village, and Jinfeng Zhongkeng, Close to Pudong in Pinghe County, Robberies Have Occurred Repeatedly in Recent Days. The Populace in Huangsha, Pudong, is Under Threat. Wealthy People Feel that They Are Fleeing to Villages Such as Dongshan and Guilin in Yanshang to Temporarily Avoid Disaster. The Garrison Troops Stationed in Zhangxi Have Dispatched a Company of Soldiers to Huangsha. Seeing this, the Remaining Bandits in Pinghe County Fled Back to the Border Area Between Yongding and Pinghe to Avoid Suppression. Furthermore, Zhang Dingcheng Recently Led More Than One Hundred Bandits, Carrying Sharp Browning Pistols and Light Machine Guns, a Total of More Than One Hundred Weapons, Through Chuxi to Xiachikeng Shuikou Dam, Bordering Pinghe, Yongding, and Dabu, to Rob Zhongkeng Village in Jinfeng Village, Yongding, at Around Nine O'Clock at Night. The Bandits Feared that the Garrison Troops Stationed Nearby Would Rush to Encircle Them. Therefore, They First Used More Than Sixty Bandits to Guard the Transportation Hubs Between Huankeng and Xiayang to Maintain Vigilance. Another Fifty or So Bandits Divided into Three Routes to Enter the Village to Search and Rob, Attacking the Wealthy Households of Hu Hanfei, Hu Pinxian, Hu Luohui, Hu Pinchuan, and Hu Junren,肆意 Robbing and Kidnapping a Total of Five Wives and Daughters of the Hus, and Killing an Old Woman, Stealing Silver and Goods Worth About One or Two Thousand Yuan. The Bandits Fled Back to Their Bandit Den Along the Original Route. By the Time the Garrison Troops Stationed in Xiayang Heard the Alarm and Rushed to the Scene, the Bandits Had Gone Far Away and Could Not Be Pursued.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Writings on Rural Hubei: Our Newspaper Dispatches a Reporter to Yangxin After the Disaster</h3>
<p>Our Reporter Visits Yangxin: Having Heard that the Road to Yangxin Was Raided by Bandits, this Reporter Bought a Boat to Wuxue. On the Morning of the 31st, I Took a Steamer Westward from Wuxue. At 4 PM, the Boat Arrived at the Old Site of Yangxin County, Which Has Been Abandoned for a Long Time. Only Ruins Remain. The County is One of the Largest in Southern Hubei, Covering an Area of 3,805.0 Square Kilometers, Extending 200 Li from East to West and 190 Li from North to South.

Fuchi is the Mouth of the Yangtze River, as well as Fuyuankou, Sanxikou, Datian, Yangxin, Paishi, Baishapu, Xintanpu, etc., Which are All Famous Market Towns. Since the Destruction During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, People Have Been Recuperating and Have Not Suffered from War for More Than Eighty Years. In 1929, the Communist Bandits Rampaged for Several Years Without Being Pacified. Following the Severe Drought the Previous Year, There Was a Major Flood Last Year. The Vitality Was Exhausted. It is Estimated that 160,000 People Died, 150,000 Became Refugees, and 40,000 Fled. More Than 20,000 Houses Were Burned Down, and Fertile Fields Were Turned into Lush Grass. Yangxin People Call for Discussion of the Bandit Disaster. It is Said that Education in the County is Developed. In 1924, There Were More Than 600 Middle School Graduates in the County, Known as the New Faction. They Are on Par with the Old Faction Who Serve as Local Gentry, and Fight Each Other Like Fire and Water. As a Result, the New Faction Failed and Sought Revenge, and Joined the Communist Party. It Erupted in 1929. On January 20, 1930, the Red Army Captured the County Seat. All the Old Faction Gentry Were Killed. The Entire County and Dragon Port, Dragon Mountain, Yanxia, ​​Mushi Port, Sanxikou, Paishi, and Datian All Fell into Important Bandit Nests. Those New Faction Bandits, were even more regard citizens as livestock. About 200,000 People Died or Fled. Afterwards, a Large Army Advanced to Suppress Them, and No One Knows How Many Died from Labor or Rotation. The Current Population is Only More Than 400,000, and There Are Only More Than 80,000 Able-Bodied Men. Talking About the Past, It is Heartbreaking.</p>
<p>The Entire County Began to be Recovered Last Year. The Main Force of the Red Bandits Has Been Expelled. Scattered Bandits Have Not Yet Been Eradicated, But They are All in the Mountainous Areas and Dare Not Go to the Plains Again. Local District Offices Have Been Set Up, Divided into Five Districts.

Many Civilian Houses Were Destroyed, and the Villagers Had Nowhere to Settle. They Built Thatched Huts. The County Government Was Also Burned Down. The Commissioner's Office of the Second District is Located in the Old Inn. Everything is Simple and Crude. The So-Called Villages Have No Ten Households Living Side by Side. One Can See the Extent of the Destruction. However, the Bandit Defense Works, Such as Fortified Villages and Stockades, are Scattered Everywhere. All Eyes Can See are Enclosures. There are Ten Villages, Thirteen Bao, Thirty Blockhouses, and 556碉樓, a Total of 610. All of These are Made from the Blood and Sweat of the People. In All the Counties of Hubei, it Can Be Said That There are the Most. Recently, the Remaining Bandits Have Risen Up Again in the Border Area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Chongyang, Tongcheng, and Tongshan Have All Been Harassed. Only Those Who Dare to Enter Yangxin are the Ones Who Achieve Results with Blockhouse Politics.</p>
<p>On April, 1935, the Rain Was Pouring Down, and I Could Not Go to the Countryside. So, I Went to the Commissioner's Office to Visit Li Huiwu, the Commissioner of the Second District and Concurrent County Chief of Yangxin. As It Happened, Li Went to Beijing. Secretary Li Weixin Received Me and Told Me About the Recovery and Rural Plans. What Has Already Been Implemented and is Effective, Relief for Disaster Victims, Has Been Issued More Than Ten Times, Divided into Seven Types: Emergency Relief, Agricultural Relief, Shelter, Price Stabilization, Work Relief, Relief Rice, and Winter Clothing. After the Refugees are Sheltered, They Are Dispersed to Return to Agriculture.

<p>Yangxin's Abundance of Barren Fields, May Be the First in the Various Counties of Southern Hubei. It Can Be Pointed Out That There Are More Than 50,000 Mu of Barren Fields Within the Sigu Dike. Speaking of the Entire County, Although There Are No Accurate Statistics, It is Roughly More Than 30 to 40%. Because of the Reduction in Farmers, and the Lack of Plowing Cattle, It is a Pity That Fertile Fields are Barren. Therefore, the Rural Economy is Also Extremely Dry. As for the Mu Donation, It is Relatively Lighter Than Before, But Still Not What the Country Can Do. There are Quite a Few Complaints About the Urgent Call. The Chamber of Commerce Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday Because the Finance Committee Increased the Commercial Donation to Discuss Coping with It. The Outcome is Unknown. There is Still One Thing Worth Mentioning, Namely, Strict Prohibition of Opium. The People in Southern Hubei Have a Preference for Smoking and Gambling, Especially Opium. Yangxin is No Exception. However, Yangxin Has Made Considerable Achievements in Opium Prohibition. Initially, the Communist Party Killed All Those Who Smoked Opium. The Smokers Then Gathered in the County Seat. There are Two Shops with Fortune Remembered as The Brand, and Forty-One Opium Dens. Even Though They Survived the Disaster, They Continue to Emit Mist and Swallow Clouds, Just Like Before. The Red Bandits Were Suppressed, and Opium Poison Spread Throughout the Countryside Again. The Commissioner's Office Issued a Strict Prohibition Order. All Ten Shops and Opium Dens Were Closed Down. Opium Offenders Were First Sent to the Abstinence and Marriage Hospital for Compulsory Abstinence. Those Who Repeated the Offense Were Punished with 200 Lashes According to Military Law. Those Who Supplied Others with Opium Were Punished with 400 Lashes. No Fines Were Imposed, and No Licenses Were Sold. It is Heard That 324 People Have Already Quit, and 552 People are Currently Quitting. Although Those Who Secretly Smoke or Supply Others with Opium Have Not Yet Been Eradicated, They No Longer Dare to Do So Openly.</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangrong Comes to Shanghai to Discuss; Reasons for the Rapid Closure of the Dongzhuang Breach - Over Two Million Yuan Saved in Expenses</h3>
<p>The Dongzhuang breach on the Yellow River caused disaster in seventeen counties in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. The closure project has now been completed. Yesterday, Kong Xiangrong, the acting chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, came to Shanghai and discussed the breach closure in great detail. The following is a narrative account. According to Mr. Kong,</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River Conservancy Commission took over the Dongzhuang breach closure, it was fortunate to be completed in less than three months. The closure work was also completed in a very short time, just before the Qingming Festival, without delaying the spring plowing of the people, and without violating the order of Minister Kong, a standing committee member of the Economic Commission and in charge of national water conservancy affairs, which is gratifying. When I, Kong Xiangrong, took over, the breach had completely diverted the river's flow, making construction difficult. The funds allocated by the central government to the previous breach committee had already been exhausted, making it even more difficult to continue without funds. At that time, Minister Kong firmly instructed that the closure be completed before Qingming, so as not to delay agricultural activities. However, he assumed full responsibility for planning the necessary funds. He first allocated 300,000 yuan to maintain the status quo during the transition between the old and new administrations and to prevent the interruption of labor and materials. He then vigorously presided over the allocation of 3 million yuan in public bonds, establishing 1.5 million yuan in cash through mortgages in less than ten days. The financial situation was extremely urgent at the time, but with the assistance of the Central Bank and the mediation of Shandong Provincial Chairman Han, it was ultimately successful. Furthermore, when there was an urgent need for funds for the excavation of the diversion channel, Mr. Kong approved my telegram requesting an additional 300,000 yuan to meet the urgent need, allowing those in charge to cope adequately and quickly close the breach. However, I, Kong Xiangrong, always mindful of the central government's difficulty in raising funds, sought to economize and economize again. It is estimated that by the time the closure was completed, more than one million yuan of material costs had been saved compared to the approved budget. Furthermore, according to the labor and materials required for the actual implementation of the project, a supplementary budget should have been requested, but it was not requested. Instead, economizing within the original budget, another one million yuan was saved, totaling over two million yuan. This is what I, Kong Xiangrong, am gratified about. As for the main materials, such as straw and willow branches, the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces instructed the counties along the river to assist in purchasing and transporting labor. Regarding stone materials, Minister Kong, acting as Premier of the Executive Yuan, proposed and passed a resolution to allocate locomotives and trains from the Longhai, Jinpu, and other five railway bureaus to increase transportation capacity, so that materials were not lacking and the project could be carried out with peace of mind. This is another reason for the rapid closure. As for the engineering, the new willow-stone-jujube-sleeper method was adopted to close the breach, while the old-fashioned "楷掃" method was used to advance and close the breach. The most effective aspects were the extension of Jiangsu and the diversion of the flow northward, as well as the smooth flow of water through the old and new diversion channels, the maintenance and progress of the willow-stone slopes, the consolidation of the willow-stone-bundled sleepers, and the temporary heavy rewards to soldiers and laborers for their risk-taking and vigorous advancement, which was also a major reason for the early celebration of the closure. Currently, due to the unified Yellow River defense issue and Minister Kong's telegram to me, Kong Xiangrong, and the provincial governments of the three provinces to discuss post-disaster engineering in order to avoid the tragedy of another breach, I have come to Beijing to seek instructions and report on the emergency closure process, as well as to request approval for two items, which have all been approved. I will soon go to Jinan with Chief Engineer Zhu to discuss everything with Chairman Han. In addition to compiling a summary of the Dongzhuang Yellow River breach closure project for the reference of those concerned about Yellow River affairs, the original memorial will also be submitted. It is attached below. The Shandong Breach Committee's proposed budget for this Dongzhuang breach, which was approved, included a total of more than 3.48 million yuan for the breach closure and diversion channel expenses. Excluding what had already been used by the previous Breach Committee, it is estimated that by the date of completion of the breach closure, the commission had saved material expenses totaling over one million yuan. This is one item to report. The reason why this breach closure was able to save a large amount of money was that every blade of grass and tree was used effectively, and every "掃占" and "石占" that were made was a further step forward. Because the project did not suffer any losses, the Economic Commission reduced the original estimate of this embankment and advancement project by 900,000 yuan, on the grounds that "旱占" cannot be calculated in the same depth as "水占". However, what Shandong did was "旱占", while what our commission did was "水占". According to the completed "水占" project, 500,000 yuan should be added, but the commission economized on the sluice gate management and did not request a supplementary budget, which is equivalent to saving 500,000 yuan. This is the second item to report. The reason why the aforementioned "掃占", "石占", and "金門占" were able to be firmly secured was that the east and west dams on the riverside side of the embankments were all added with the "柳石坦坡" protection project. This project was not estimated by the previous Breach Committee. Now, 18,000 square feet of stone blocks have been purchased, and 10,000 square feet have been transported to Jinan for use. Compared to the approved budget, at least more than 500,000 yuan should be added, but the commission has economized on the original budget and purchased them without requesting a third supplement. This time, the closure was rapid, saving money and materials in large quantities, and it was largely due to the hard work of the staff. During the emergency closure and the critical moment of convergence, I, Kong Xiangrong, announced in public that if the closure could be completed today, the soldiers and laborers throwing willow bundles in the front line of the two dams would be awarded 2,000 yuan for each dam. The two section chiefs leading the soldiers and laborers who risked their lives would each be awarded 500 yuan. As expected, under the heavy reward, the soldiers and laborers did not care for themselves, and I, Kong Xiangrong, personally directed the work, and the closure was completed within four hours. The closure work was also due to the fact that during the closure of the side dam, the "夹土" at the "龍門口" was stimulated by the flow, which was turbulent and dangerous. I, Kong Xiangrong, supervised the soldiers and laborers on the two dams to vigorously advance and turned the danger into safety in an instant. The closure work was completed, and according to the example, the soldiers and laborers on the west and east dams were each awarded 500 yuan. This is the fourth item to report. The materials saved this time should be used for various embankment restoration and post-disaster projects in accordance with your previous telegram. The work has continued to be rushed forward without daring to stop. However, regarding the embankment restoration work in Shandong Province, it is necessary to personally discuss the handling with Chairman Han. Before the central government sends personnel to inspect and accept the work, I intend to rush to Jinan to discuss everything and ask whether I can make discretionary plans for work within the scope of the original approved budget for the breach closure. This is one item to request instructions for. This Dongzhuang project was huge, not comparable to Fenglou and Guantai. Transportation was difficult and construction was dangerous. All the personnel in various places were able to work hard. For more than two months in the past three months, they had not slept. Some vomited blood and some were seriously ill. I, Kong Xiangrong, could not bear it. Now, it is fortunate that the closure has been completed and the breach work has been completed, without delaying the spring plowing of the people. Can we follow the example of the Fenglou and Guantai breach closures and calculate all the original salaries and fees that the staff members in the work have contributed and give them two more months as a reward for their efforts? This is the second item to request instructions for. The reasonable thing is to draft a memorial to request review and instructions, and to follow them respectfully. Respectfully presented to Kong, Standing Committee Member and Director of the Water Conservancy Commission.</p>

<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, the trade unions of this city held a public farewell banquet yesterday noon at the Atlantic Restaurant for Zhu Xuefan, the representative of this year's National Labor Conference, and Zhao Banfu, the representative of the Maritime Conference. The following attended: Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Committee; Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Ye Xianggao, and Long Peiyun, standing committee members of the General Labor Union; Gong Yuting, Fan Yifeng, Zhang Kechang, Li Hua, Lu Muqin, Zhao Zhenhui, Zhang Zhuyun, Le Junwen, and other representatives from various trade unions in the four districts, including cigarette manufacturing, ink manufacturing, sauce making, tugboats, postal workers, postal staff, navigation, Anlu, the five districts, including match manufacturing, five districts, including cigarette manufacturing, military uniforms, tea making, five districts, including cotton spinning, car drivers, two districts, including water and electricity, wooden shipbuilding, civil ship shoulder bearers, hat making, one district, including water and electricity, candle industry, six districts, including knitting, six districts, including silk reeling, leather making, six districts, including water and electricity, dyeing, three districts, including cotton spinning, freight forwarding, water pipe engineering, pharmaceuticals, ten districts, including cotton spinning, special zone public buses, labor movement association, newspaper industry, six districts, including public buses, one district, including cleaning, two districts, including shipbuilding, toothbrushes, five districts, including carpentry, newspaper distribution, four districts, including rubber, "梗片", nine districts, including soap pharmaceuticals, four districts, including shipbuilding, one district, including shipbuilding, and over one hundred fifty guests and guests such as Ren Jinping, etc.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech. During the meeting, Chairman Zhou Xuexiang delivered a farewell speech, stating in brief: "Comrade Zhu Xuefan is an advanced worker in the labor community. His spirit of leading the labor movement and working diligently for several years is worthy of our admiration. This time, being sent to attend the National Labor Conference, he will be able to negotiate and defend the interests of our country's laborers in the international arena and strive for equality in international status, while at the same time increasing the glory of our country's government. Comrade Zhao Banfu has a considerable history in the maritime field, and we are also confident that he will be able to strive for the welfare of all seafarers. We also hope that the two representatives will take the opportunity to attend the meeting to observe the construction of the United States and new countries, as well as the situation of their people's organizations, so that they can introduce them to the domestic labor community after returning to the country. Today, we have prepared a simple meal and held a public farewell banquet, and we offer a toast to wish the two gentlemen a safe journey."</p>
<p>Zhu Xuefan's Speech. Zhu then stood up and delivered a speech, saying: "This time, I have been appointed by the Central Committee to represent the 20th National Labor Conference, and I am ashamed of my talent and unable to shoulder the heavy responsibility. I am very grateful for the grand banquet held by the trade unions of this city to send me off. The International Labor Organization is an international labor organization established based on the Treaty of Peace, and its role is to eliminate the injustice, hardship, poverty, and various inhuman systems of the majority of people in the world through international cooperation, maintain and improve the living standards of workers, and establish a permanent peace and happiness in human society. At least one international labor conference is held every year, bringing together representatives from the government, employers, and labor of each member country to jointly discuss and resolve various labor issues. Since its establishment in 1919, there have been 19 conferences held, with 45 draft conventions and many recommendations passed. Therefore, it has made many contributions to the improvement of labor issues around the world, and its impact on the progress of international labor legislation is significant. In fact, it can be called the highest labor legislative body in the international arena. China is one of the countries that signed the Treaty of Peace, so it is also an original member of the International Labor Organization. Since 1929, it has begun to send complete delegations to attend, that is, representatives from the government, employers, and labor are all present at the conference. China is still an agricultural society, but in recent years, light industry has shown development. According to the latest estimates by the Labor Bureau, there are 30 million workers. In addition, handicraft workers and mobile workers are not included. Furthermore, due to the rapid collapse of the countryside in recent years, farmers have been forced to sell their labor in cities, forming a surplus of labor. The new industries have been devastated by international economic aggression, not only unable to develop, but also unable to maintain their original foundation, and have stopped working and reduced labor one after another. As a result, the number of unemployed has increased sharply. According to the above estimates, there are already 5,893,000 unemployed workers among the number of workers, causing the current unstable situation. Therefore, China's labor problem has obviously reached a very serious level, and the degree to which it needs to be resolved is also very urgent, and there is much reliance on international cooperation and assistance. Modern international relations are becoming increasingly close, and any issue is related to the international community. Only through open international discussions, abandoning racial, class, and political prejudices, can an accurate and effective solution be obtained. You and I are all Chinese workers, and we ourselves are direct victims of the unreasonable system. We have the most practical experience of the suffering and needs of Chinese workers. I will do my best at this conference to arouse international attention and sympathy, so that they can update their views on China. The most painful thing for Chinese workers at present, apart from the economic aspect, is the cruel and harsh treatment of Chinese workers by foreigners who set up factories in China, such as refusing factory inspections by the Chinese government, neglecting protective facilities, disregarding workers' interests, and not allowing workers to form associations and meetings, which is most embarrassing for us. The right to association and assembly is a basic right of the people in modern civilized countries, and the International Labor Organization Charter and Chinese laws have clear provisions. This right cannot be deprived by any force. However, foreigners in Chinese concessions openly prohibit Chinese workers from forming trade unions, do not recognize our worker representatives, and do not abide by Chinese laws. We can hardly tolerate this point any longer. I intend to submit this to the conference and request the National Labor Conference to make a fair ruling. In addition, there is the issue that domestic workers and foreign workers should receive equal treatment. In this world economic panic, countries have adopted the policy of excluding foreign workers as a result of the recession. In recent years, the tragic situation of various countries排斥 Chinese workers has been seen even now. There are still a huge number of Chinese workers who have been forced to become unemployed and are wandering in foreign lands. I have already drafted a proposal on this point, requesting the conference to take effective measures. In addition, I also plan to raise issues concerning requesting various countries to assist China in prohibiting opium and poison, as well as our country's unemployment problem and the dumping of foreign goods. Here, we must have an understanding that China's labor problem cannot be separated from international relations and solved independently. However, it is also unreliable to rely solely on the help of others. Only by relying on ourselves can we overcome difficulties. At the same time, we must recognize the characteristics of China's labor problem, which from the beginning includes the nature of national resistance. In other words, China's labor problem is China's national liberation problem. Therefore, while seeking the liberation of the workers themselves, we must not neglect the importance of national rejuvenation. We must unite and work hard, and only in this way can the liberation and happiness of the workers be guaranteed permanently and strongly. In recent years, the active progress of the Chinese labor movement has been a very gratifying thing. Most Chinese workers have considerable organizations. According to statistics from the Central Civil Movement Steering Committee, in 1934, the number of Chinese trade unions was 458. In fact, there are still many omissions, and they are all actively striving for the road to national restoration under the leadership of our party. This kind of resolute and courageous spirit is one of the greatest forces. This force will undoubtedly become an important element in the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. However, we should not be complacent, but should strive for progress and perfection in order to complete this glorious historical mission. I am representing Chinese workers to attend the conference this time, and I am a servant of all of you present and the workers of the whole country. All of you present are leaders of the Shanghai labor community, and I am sure that you will provide good opinions. I also hope that the comrades of the national labor community will give instructions and correct my shortcomings at any time. That is what I hope for."</p>
<p>Representative's Speech. Zhao Banfu then gave a thank-you speech, briefly stating that he felt that his knowledge was shallow and that he was not competent enough to attend the Maritime Conference this time, but he was honored by the summoning of the leaders of various trade unions and felt even more ashamed. This time, going abroad, he would follow Mr. Xuefan and do his best to strive for the happiness of seafarers. Today, participating in the farewell banquet, in addition to expressing his gratitude to everyone, he also hoped that everyone would give him advice at any time. Then, Lu Jingshi, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, Ren Jinping, a guest, and Shao Xubai, a standing committee member of the General Labor Union, successively gave speeches. The general idea was that they hoped that the two representatives would work hard in the international arena and strive for national power, rejuvenate the Chinese nation, and then Chinese workers would be able to obtain true liberation.</p>

<h3>Bank of Communications: Yesterday Held General Meeting of Shareholders; Net Profit of Over 1.29 Million Yuan for the 24th Year</h3>
<p>The 25th General Meeting of Shareholders of the Bank of Communications was held at 3 PM yesterday in the conference room on the fifth floor of the Hong Kong Road Bankers' Association. Attendees included government shareholders' representatives Tang Shoumin, Song Ziliang, Xi Demao, Chen Hang, Zhang Shoumin, and commercial shareholders Hu Bijang, Qian Xinzhi, Hu Mengjia, Xu Xinliu, Shen Shuyu, Li Fuxun, Qin Runqing, Zhou Zuomin, Ye Fuxiao, Yang Desen, Wang Zhixin, and over a hundred others, chaired by Hu Bijang, Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: After the bell rang to commence the meeting, Chairman Hu Bijang first reported that the shares represented at today's General Meeting of Shareholders amounted to 14,509,100 yuan, which met the legal quorum for the meeting to proceed. After leading the attendees in a formal greeting, he reported on the business situation for the 24th year. Next, Director Zhuang Shuhou of the Auditing Department reported on the business accounts, and Supervisor Xu Xiudao reported that there were no discrepancies in the audit of the accounts. Afterwards, bank staff reported on the proposal to increase the savings fund and allocate another credit fund. The report also covered the amendment to the bank's articles of association, which was passed by the previous general meeting of shareholders and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for instructions. Proposals were then put forward regarding: The profit distribution plan for the 25th year. The proposal to deposit savings reserve funds. Both were passed as proposed.</p>
<p>Business Report: The bank's business situation for the 24th year was as follows: The total outstanding balance of deposits was over 33,147,400 yuan, an increase of over 89,427,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The outstanding balance of fixed deposits was over 7,620,000 yuan, the outstanding balance of current deposits was over 14,403,000 yuan, and the outstanding balance of cashier's checks and miscellaneous deposits was over 11,244,000 yuan. The total amount of outward remittances was over 45,704,900 yuan, an increase of over 16,600,700 yuan compared to the previous year. The total amount of purchased drafts was over 29,331,800 yuan, an increase of over 11,164,100 yuan compared to the previous year. This was a significant improvement, as the bank has always focused on facilitating remittances to support the flow of industrial finance. During the year, branches and offices continued to be established, the distribution of remittance locations was further expanded, and efforts were made to simplify procedures and improve convenience for customers. Since the currency system was changed, remittances throughout the country have been free of any water adjustment, making turnover more flexible and achieving some success. The total outstanding balance of loans and investments was over 25,467,800 yuan, an increase of over 39,786,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The outstanding balance of fixed loans was over 6,369,500 yuan, remaining at about the same level as the previous two years. The outstanding balance of current loans was over 15,028,800 yuan, an increase of over 19,329,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The outstanding balance of discounted loans was over 5,942,000 yuan, similar to the previous year. The outstanding balance of marketable securities was over 34,751,000 yuan, an increase of over 11,380,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Excluding marketable securities, the total outstanding balance of fixed loans, current loans, and discounted loans was over 21,992,500 yuan, an increase of over 28,405,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The increase was mainly due to loans secured by goods and factory sites, followed by loans secured by securities, and then loans to institutions and organizations. The bank's lending practices have always emphasized credit based on collateral. In addition to adding warehouses to directly undertake cargo pledges this year, it also focused on industrial and agricultural loans. Therefore, the increase in cargo pledges alone was significant, and factory site pledges also saw some success. The net profit was over 1,290,900 yuan, an increase of over 383,000 yuan compared to the previous year. The interest and handling fees accounted for the majority of the income, totaling over 6,331,000 yuan. As for expenses, various expenses increased slightly with the development of business, totaling over 3,619,000 yuan. In addition, depreciation of real estate and property was allocated separately according to past practice, totaling over 963,000 yuan. Bad debts totaled over 137,000 yuan, and issuance tax totaled over 310,900 yuan. The total expenses were over 5,040,900 yuan. After offsetting the income and expenses, the net profit was over 1,290,900 yuan. The total amount of banknotes in circulation, excluding banknotes from Liaoning and Harbin and other old banknotes that were only received but not issued, was 18,082,560 yuan, an increase of 7,759,800 yuan compared to the previous year. The cash reserve was 11,762,183 yuan, accounting for over 65% of the circulating amount. The guarantee reserve was 6,320,03817 yuan, accounting for just under 35% of the circulating amount. In terms of the annual issuance situation, although there was a decline in the slow months of February, April, and May, as in previous years, it gradually increased after June. By the end of October, it was comparable to the highest amount at the end of the previous year. Since the implementation of the new currency system in November, the bank's banknotes have been designated as legal tender, and the amount in circulation has been strengthened.</p>
<p>Administrative Report: Regarding administrative reforms and various tasks, the important ones are as follows: In March of this year, the bank was ordered by the government to amend the Bank of Communications regulations, changing the total amount of the bank's capital to 20 million yuan in national currency and expanding government shares by 12 million yuan, which has been fully allocated. All dividend ratios and the number of supervisors have been revised. The government has also granted special permission for the bank to be a bank that develops national industry. The types of business have not changed significantly and are still entrusted by the government to handle various matters and may be entrusted by the Central Bank. The bank's responsibilities have become even more important, and its capital strength has doubled. As for the bank's amended articles of association, the previous general meeting of shareholders has already discussed and passed them. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance ordered the revision and approval for record. In recent years, the promotion of business has been based on the principle of assisting industry and balancing finance between urban and inland areas. The expansion of the business network is mainly in the coastal and railway lines. The business institutions in the Shaanxi, Shanxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong areas have been continuously developed or appropriately adjusted. The branch offices in the Northeast have been reorganized or directly abolished in accordance with the times. Over thirty new banks, credit departments, and sub-departments were opened this year. Warehouses have also continued to increase this year. The newly opened warehouses include those in Hanyang, Changsha, Ningbo, Wuxi, Huangqiao, Qingjiangpu, Bengbu, and Suiyuan. The remaining construction projects are underway. In addition to the former construction of the Harbin, Hailar, Dalian, and Yantai branches, the Changshu branch and the Shanghai warehouse have also been completed one after another. The bank buildings under construction this year include those in Xuzhou and Gulangyu. There are also warehouses in Bengbu, Ningbo, Xi'an, and Weinan. More than half of the construction projects have been completed, and the purchase of land and the design and construction are underway in more than one or two locations. This year, from spring to autumn, domestic industry was stimulated by international financial policies, and there was panic due to rural disasters. The currency was tight, and business declined. In early November, stimulated by currency reform, the dynamics of the industrial sector gradually became active, but the purchasing power of the people did not increase. Industry and commerce still need to be strengthened. The bank's mission is to develop industry, and it should provide appropriate assistance in this environment. Over the past year, the bank has worked with the government on projects such as the silk industry improvement plan, the preparation and control of the fishing industry, and the regional management of agricultural credit cooperatives. It has also paid particular attention to expanding export businesses. In terms of industry and commerce, it has provided loans to textile factories, flour mills, and chemical factories to help them expand their operations if they are expected to make progress but lack working capital. For larger projects that require comprehensive planning, it has assisted in designing reasonable plans or issuing corporate bonds for the bank to underwrite, so as to promote their self-reliance and complete the bank's mission of assisting and regulating the economy. In recent years, the government has been boldly advancing construction projects. All aspects of road repair and water conservancy projects have been planned with foresight and actively implemented. The bank has a long-standing and historical relationship with these projects. Over the past year, the bank has spared no effort to support the connection of the Jiangnan Railway and the Jingwu Line, the extension of the Longhai Railway's Xibao section, the construction of the Xiangqian Highway, the Zhunhe project, and the dredging of the Yellow River's water conservancy, all of which improve people's livelihoods and promote production. As for projects that have not yet been completed, such as the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge, the diversion of the Wei River, and the development of the Huainan Railway Coal Mine, the bank will continue to provide assistance according to the original plans. This year, after the start of the Lunar New Year, the bank recognized that Shanghai's finance is the lifeblood of the country and cannot be ignored. It cooperated with the Central Bank and the Bank of China to provide interbank lending to various banks to facilitate turnover. It also purchased silver from Hong Kong and London to provide assistance. The panic in the market was initially relieved. When the market became tight again during the Spring Festival, the government took emergency measures to provide relief, and the bank joined with other banks to form a syndicate to provide lending. It also worked with the Bank of China to serve as a clearinghouse for concentrated exchange of bills, adjusting the holdings of various banks and financiers. It was able to barely survive the crisis. From August onwards, the bank cooperated with other banks to provide industrial and commercial credit, which was used as a more general form of adjustment. The bank's banknotes were designated as legal tender, and society's expectations of the bank became even stronger. The bank also followed the government's policy, adjusting the situation in various local markets to promote the implementation of the currency system and establish a solid foundation. The trust business has already handled services such as the custody of securities, agency insurance, and the leasing of real estate. This year, as society's need for trust services has gradually increased, and the trust business is related to the bank's special mission of developing industry, the bank has specially formulated trust articles of association and submitted them to the Ministry for record. The trust fund is also planned to be allocated separately and managed independently, and it will be implemented gradually according to the needs of various branches. As for the future direction of efforts, there are about six points: Focus on mortgages to regulate the market's finance. Focus on corporate bonds to support productive enterprises. Support export businesses to adjust foreign trade. Expand inland business to support the rural economy. Increase the number of new warehouses to facilitate production and sales. Develop the trust business to complete the task of serving society. The first three items belong to the use of funds, and the last three items belong to the promotion of business, all based on the principle of circulating the finance of various industries and cultivating production and sales capabilities. In this time of economic decline, although we dare not predict the extent of the success, we must strive to achieve it with unity.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Telegraphs Request to Exempt Whole Tax on Broken Rice</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai telegraphed Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, The people of Ningbo are facing a food crisis. The association has previously dispatched representatives to meet with President Jiang to request a solution and to issue tax-exempt passports to facilitate relief. Subsequently, the Ningbo Food Management Committee ordered the rice industry to purchase sufficient quantities. As such, 5,500 tons of foreign broken rice was ordered to provide affordable rice for the poor. The rice industry has registered with the government. Recently, a ministry order has been issued stating that, starting from April 11th, imported foreign broken rice will be taxed at the same rate as whole rice, resulting in a doubled tax burden on the broken rice ordered by Ningbo. Therefore, we telegraph to request that the minister review and order the Zhejiang Customs to continue to tax the registered broken rice for Ningbo at the old rate and to reply via telegram. Yu Qiaqing et al. of the Ningbo Association respectfully bow."</p>
<h3>Lin Yi'shun's Coffin Transported to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The coffin of Lin Yi'shun, a revolutionary pioneer and overseas Chinese from Nanyang, was moved from the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road to the North Station at 6:30 AM yesterday. No ceremonial guards were used along the way. At 7:55 AM, a special carriage was added to the fourth Shanghai-Beijing express train for transport to Beijing. A white cloth banner reading "The Coffin of Mr. Lin Yi'shun, a Pioneer of the Party and Nation, Being Transported to Beijing for Public Burial" was hung on the carriage. The Shanghai Public Security Bureau band also arrived to play music in tribute. Those accompanying the coffin to Beijing, in addition to Lin Yi'shun's son, Lin Minchang, included Feng Ziyou, Zhang Yongfu, Shao Fei, Zhang Huadan, Shao Jun, and over twenty others. Mayor Wu specially dispatched Li Dachao to the station to see off the coffin and take care of everything. The carriage is expected to arrive in Beijing at 1:50 PM and will be temporarily stored at the Renxiao Funeral Home on Moshou Road. His son will return to Shanghai from Singapore in a week and will come north again with his family when the date of the public burial is set.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Replies to the All-Zhejiang Public Association Regarding the Issuance of New Public Bonds</h3>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Public Association received a reply telegram from the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which read: "To the All-Zhejiang Public Association in Shanghai, We have received and read your esteemed telegram of the day. The Zhejiang Provincial Finance is facing a severe deficit and is on the verge of collapse. The debt service expenses for the 25th year of the Republic have increased to over 11 million yuan, exceeding one-half of the annual revenue. The debt service cannot be reduced according to the agreements, and the various administrative expenses are difficult to cut. Furthermore, in this time of rural bankruptcy and social economic decline, there is no way to open up new sources of tax revenue. The disparity between income and expenditure is so great that a budget cannot be prepared. Moreover, the provincial treasury's existing financial resources are definitely unable to bear this huge debt. To alleviate the current difficulties and stabilize future credit, there is no other way but to reorganize all debts. Although the silver and money industries in this province may have slightly different views on the extension of bond deadlines and interest rate reductions, they have now understood after clear explanations. We deeply appreciate your concern for your hometown and your enthusiastic support. Your suggestion to use the original bond funds of this province as collateral to consult with the Ministry of Finance and order the Central Bank to lend legal tender at low interest rates to fully recover the originally issued bonds is a very good solution. The Ministry of Finance has also considered this plan, but the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications still need to provide cash reserves in accordance with the regulations for issuing legal tender, making it difficult to negotiate a resolution. Finance Director Cheng has gone to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Finance and implement the plan accordingly. We know of your concern and are providing this update. We hope you understand. Governor Huang Shaoji of the Zhejiang Provincial Government."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Jiangsu Construction Bureau to Reimburse Funds Advanced for Dredging the Wusong River</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, formerly the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, borrowed funds from the Nantao Branch of the China United Trading Corporation on behalf of the Wusong River Conservancy Association to dredge the Wusong River. Having not yet been reimbursed, yesterday, it sent a letter to the Jiangsu Construction Bureau requesting that it arrange for reimbursement and that it inform the China United Trading Corporation of the progress. The original letter stated:</p>
<p>Letter to the Jiangsu Construction Bureau: In regards to the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in January of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), to refuse the Dredging Bureau being led by foreign consultants, joined the Shanghai, Baoshan, Jiading, Qingpu, Taicang, Kunshan, Wuxian, and Wujiang eight-county legal entities to organize the Wusong River Conservancy Association, submitted a report to the former Jiangsu Provincial Governor's Office, approved for filing, raised funds for independent dredging. In August of the 13th year, construction began on the section east of New Gate Bridge to the mouth of the river, completed in May of the 15th year. At that time, donations from the eight counties were either overturned mid-negotiation, diverted for other uses due to cases, or delayed due to hesitation. At that time, Fang Jifan, the vice president of the Wusong River Conservancy Association, was also the vice president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the deficit in the funds for that section of the project was borrowed from banks in the city by the vice president to meet the construction needs. The banks, considering that the Wusong River Conservancy Association was newly formed, while the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce had a long history, made the loans with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce as the counterparty. Therefore, the main body of this loan for dredging the Wusong River seems to belong to the association, but in reality, it is directly the responsibility of the former General Chamber of Commerce. In January of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), the Wusong River Conservancy Association, considering that the eastern section was completed, and the eight-county legal entities, such as county councils, could no longer exist according to the law, lacking anyone responsible, and having no hope for continued work, immediately submitted a report to your bureau requesting a declaration of dissolution and a request to return the advanced funds. On January 31st of that year, Instruction No. 298 from your bureau stated that the funds advanced by the association should be comprehensively planned again and other methods discussed. Subsequently, on February 17th, March 27th, February of the 18th year, May 15th, December 18th of the 18th year, January 9th, January 29th, May 19th of the 19th year, May 25th of the 20th year, December 27th of the 22nd year, the association submitted reports to your bureau urging immediate reimbursement. In the association's reports, the most crucial phrases include, "Those who embezzled public funds are able to hide and protect themselves, while those who suffered losses for public affairs have no way to seek redress, inevitably causing those who take on responsibilities to lose heart and despair, and the difficult situation is recounted with tears." Also, Instruction No. 2994 from your bureau in June of the 19th year to the association stated that for this fund, only Wuxian County had remitted 12,000 yuan in total, while the other counties were either delaying remittance or had not determined a method, and that disbursement should wait until a large amount of funds had been remitted and the methods of the other counties had been determined. Subsequently, on March 30th of the 23rd year, your bureau instructed the association, stating that although the Wusong River dredging funds of the various counties had been cleared in the past, they still had not been remitted, and according to the previous report, the Finance Department had been consulted to send personnel to re-clear and urge remittance, and that disbursement would be made after a certain amount had been remitted. Since then, the association has not received any further instructions from your bureau, but the bank has been urging payment for a long time, and its tone has gradually become stricter. Furthermore, the debt has been accumulating over time, with interest compounding, becoming increasingly large. In June of the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the outstanding principal and interest owed to the bank amounted to 87,754 yuan and 19 fen. By the end of December of the 24th year, it had reached 220,027 yuan. Such a heavy debt is certainly not in the interest of the public. Our association is suffering for others' mistakes and has no way to resolve it. We hereby request that your bureau, in accordance with the association's reports, earnestly take responsibility for arranging reimbursement, in the spirit of public cooperation.</p>
<p>Reply to China United Trading Corporation Nantao Branch: On the 11th of this month, we received your letter stating that the funds borrowed by the former General Chamber of Commerce from your bank for dredging the Wusong River have been outstanding for a long time and requesting that we find a way to resolve the matter. In this matter, your branch's letter to our association on November 6th of the 23rd year was most earnest, stating that "the reason our bank made this loan is a small matter for water conservancy and a large matter for sovereignty. Because our bank made the loan, Chinese rights were protected, and the government should reward us." Therefore, the former General Chamber of Commerce's protection of the country and sovereignty was the same standpoint as your branch, and it has been understood. Therefore, our association replied on November 15th of that year, stating that "In general, the former General Chamber of Commerce handled this matter, as your letter said, for the sake of preserving sovereignty, and it is in the same situation as your bank, suffering for public affairs. Our association, inheriting the duties of the former four merchant groups, has also been urging the government to pay this advanced fund. I hope you will understand." Now that we have received your instructions, our association feels the same anxiety as your branch after many years, and what we can tell your branch is that we are still continuing to urge payment and dare not neglect it.</p>
<h3>Three Instances of Extortion by Bandits at the Xingshan Nunnery in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Buddhist nun Zhizhen, age 50, of Anhui province, is the abbess of the Xingshan Nunnery on Zhongxing Road, Song Park Road, Zhabei. The nunnery is usually quite prosperous, attracting the covetous attention of bandits. On the afternoons of the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month, at 3:00 PM, 3:00 PM, and 3:30 PM respectively, a group of six or seven individuals went to the nunnery, pried open the gate with iron tools, rushed in, and threatened the young nuns to extort money. Fortunately, Abbess Zhizhen was out and had not returned. The group failed in their plot and left disgruntled. Afterwards, Nun Zhizhen reported the incident to the North Station Sub-Bureau. Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, Detective Squad Leader Gu Shucheng, Guo Mengqu, along with detectives Shen Jinchu, Zhou Jitang, Huai Xinmao, and others, together with officers dispatched by the New Gate Sub-Bureau, rushed to No. 5, Wufuli, Meiyuan Road, and arrested extortionist bandits Yin Huaiyu (age 25, from Funing) and Sun Wencai (age 38, from Yangzhou). After interrogation, the sub-bureau prepared a document to submit to the general bureau for investigation and prosecution, as the case concerned extortion and fraud.</p>
<h3>Inside the Gu Zhuxuan Case: Conniving in the Case of Opium Addicts Jia and Wu Concluded; Prosecutor Argues for Permitting Opium Use; Debate Concluded; Judgment to be Announced on the 25th</h3>
<p>After Gu Zhuxuan was detained by the Special Second Court for instigating an assassination and sentenced to fifteen years, during the appeal period, Gu bribed the guards outside the prison ward where he was being held and incited perjury. At the same time, prison guard supervisor Jia Furong and guard station supervisor Wu Lu connived with Gu to allow him to smoke opium in prison. The Second Section Chief of the Prison, Ouyang Sen, went to search and found opium residue, opium pipe stems, white powder, and cigarettes, among other evidence. After the prosecutor filed a public prosecution against them with the criminal court of the same court, various investigations were conducted, as reported in the previous issue. Yesterday afternoon, the malfeasance case against Jia Furong and Wu Lu was further investigated. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu, along with Prosecutor Wang, came to the Second Criminal Court. First, the ages and origins of the two defendants, Jia and Wu, were asked, and then they were questioned separately. The prosecutor said to Jia Furong, "The High Third Court and the prison both have orders and announcements stating that they must assist in guarding prisoners in the external prison ward. Now, you are responsible for the prisoners. "Jia replied that as long as the prisoners do not escape, he is responsible. "How many people smoke opium in the external prison ward?" "I don't know if anyone smokes." "Then how did you find opium residue in Gu's room? How did it get in?" "I don't know the truth, and I didn't see it. If I had seen it, I wouldn't have been so careless." "How much money did you get?" "I have always been law-abiding and have never dared to be greedy." Wu Lu was then brought in. According to Wu's confession, he was assigned to the external prison ward on October 11th of last year to assist the prison guard. "Do you go into the prison cells?" "No, but the inspection is very strict. Every time I get off work, Jia Furong checks for me." "Did you see any opium during the inspection?" "I have never seen it." "Then why did prisoner Wang A'er say that you bought opium for Gu?" "In fact, Wang A'er and I have a grudge." Informants Li Heshang, Guo Shanyu, and Wang A'er were brought in and uniformly stated that Jia and Wu had connived with Gu Zhuxuan to allow him to smoke opium, but the civilians had no animosity against Jia and Wu. The rest of the testimony was the same as the previous hearing. The prosecutor ordered the debate to begin. First, Prosecutor Wang Ren stepped forward to argue, stating that the various accusers in this case unanimously identified the two defendants as conniving in permitting opium use, and that last year, Chief Ouyang, based on Wang A'er's report, went to search and found opium residue and opium pipes, which were sent to the Forensic Research Institute for examination. The results confirmed that there was opium use. Although it cannot be proven that the two defendants took bribes and bought opium, the fact that they permitted the prisoner to smoke opium is clear. He requested that they be investigated and prosecuted according to law. The lawyers for the two defendants then argued for a long time. Presiding Judge Wang then announced the conclusion of the debate and set the judgment for the afternoon of the 25th. Jia Furong was still entrusted to the warden for custody, and Wu Lu and the accusers were returned to prison.</p>
<h3>Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association: The Opening Ceremony of the Third Fundraiser Convened Yesterday; Mayor Wu, Jordan, and 50 Others Attended; 100,000 Yuan Raised to Build the Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital</h3>
<p>The Chinese Anti-Tuberculosis Association held the opening ceremony of its third fundraiser at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 4:00 PM yesterday. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Jordan, the Chief Health Officer of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Lu Bohong, the Director of the Association, Li Tingan, the Director of the Health Bureau, and fundraising team leaders Yan Fuqing, Niu Huisheng, Jae Bochi, Ding Huikang, Xi Guansheng, Zhou Bangjun, Wu Yunxu, Liu Yide, Li Dachao, and about 50 others attended. They were divided into 55 teams for fundraising. In addition, in honor of the 70th birthday of Shanghai leader Yu Qiaqing on July 3rd of this year, the association plans to raise 100,000 yuan to build the Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital, which was also approved at yesterday's meeting. Various groups and individuals initiated the effort, and a committee for administrative design was elected to actively promote it. Lu Bohong had already purchased more than 60 mu of land near the North Bridge in Shanghai County for the foundation, and the groundbreaking ceremony is scheduled for July 3rd.</p>
<p>President's Speech: After the ceremony, President Lu Bohong delivered a speech, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, today is the day to solicit members and raise funds. I have good news to tell you. I have been serving society for nearly thirty years, but I have never been able to complete an anti-tuberculosis hospital. This year, July 3rd, is the birthday of Shanghai leader Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Our association plans to take this opportunity to raise 100,000 to 200,000 yuan to build an anti-tuberculosis hospital, named 'Qiaqing Anti-Tuberculosis Hospital.' I have already purchased more than 60 mu of land near the North Bridge in Shanghai County, with a width of 850 feet and a depth of 450 feet. We plan to build it in nine sections, first building five sections, four sections for patients, and one section for doctors and offices. When all nine sections are completed, it can accommodate 1,000 patients. Currently, we have the land, but we lack the construction funds. Therefore, we plan to raise funds. We hope you will support us. As for the doctors, famous hospitals abroad have volunteered to assign them. Also, this year's membership drive aims to raise 15,000 yuan. We have hired 55 fundraising teams, each led by one person, and they have all agreed. This year, we plan to add tuberculosis clinics in various areas of the concessions."</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Speech: "Ladies and gentlemen, I am sorry for arriving late due to an event today. This year, I was elected as the overall team leader of the fundraising event. Although I may not be able to spare much time to serve, this matter is important, so I dare not decline. Preventing tuberculosis in China is the most urgent matter. In the past, there was not only a lack of action but also a lack of understanding. We need to attach importance to this disease. New medicine has been in China for a long time, but generally, people only pay attention to tuberculosis when they cough up blood. With toothaches, people only think they're sick when they are in pain, and they don't think of it as a disease otherwise. In fact, toothaches without pain are more serious than those with pain. I didn't have this feeling before, but after I contracted it myself, I realized its importance. In this city, when we examine students' health, 80 out of 100 have a positive reaction to pulmonary tuberculosis, which makes them very likely to develop lung tuberculosis in the future. This is what the ordinary society does not pay attention to, and the government does not have the extra power to do. Three years ago, Mr. Niu Huisheng and others, aware of this, initiated this association. In the past three years, its work has been focused on propaganda and prevention. Recently, fundraising activities have gradually shown results. This time, we plan to build a defense hospital in honor of Mr. Yu Qiaqing's 70th birthday. Mr. Yu has served in Shanghai for 55 years, encouraging local business and sparing no effort. Therefore, we plan to commemorate him with this plan and benefit the local area. This is a win-win situation. This association is preparing to raise funds, and we ask for your assistance."</p>
<p>Speeches by Jordan and Yan: Chief Health Officer Jordan of the Shanghai Municipal Council then spoke, saying, "Shanghai's health implementation work, such as treatment and prevention, I am an official of the concessions, and I will do my best. Over the past few years, health implementation has made progress. I represent the Shanghai Municipal Council in thanking the social leaders for their help. Today, I heard that an anti-tuberculosis hospital will be built, and I hope it can be completed soon." Yan Fuqing then spoke, saying, "In the past two or three years, after difficult work where spending money didn't seem effective, this association has gradually made progress. This association is an organization jointly initiated by the government and society. The government promotes it, society works hard, and the results are effective. This association currently has three full-time staff members who handle daily affairs. We have also hired a full-time doctor to set up clinics and assist nurses. Tuberculosis prevention requires hospitals and doctors, which is very difficult. Patients need long-term treatment and attention to diet. Therefore, no one has ever done it. I have set up a lung disease sanatorium in Yeyuan, Jiangwan, with 150 beds. Those who are treated must stay for at least three months to half a year. There are more than 300 people who want to come in, but there is no way to accommodate them, so they are temporarily staying at the Zhabei Clinic. As soon as there is an opportunity, they rush to the hospital first, which shows the suffering of the patients. Now, there is a large-scale anti-tuberculosis hospital, and I hope to see it completed soon." Zhou Bangjun then spoke (omitted).</p>

<h3>Breaking the Case of the Kidnapping of Zhou Jiasheng: Twelve Male and Female Kidnappers Apprehended for Interrogation; Heavy Rainfalls as a Relentless Judge Interrogates, Then Postpones for Further Investigation; Police Apprehended Another Accomplice Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Zhou Chunbo, a native of Hubei, ran a cotton yarn business under the name "Tianshengfu" on Guangdong Road, Dehe Lane. His family resided at No. 135 Buban Road, Bobert Lane in the French Concession. He had a three-year-old son named Jiasheng. On the afternoon of the fourth of this month at one o'clock, while being taken out to play by his nanny, Ms. Jin Zhou, a native of Shaoxing, they were suddenly abducted by a group of kidnappers who seized both her and the child. Zhou reported this to the French police, requesting an investigation. Subsequently, the kidnappers repeatedly sent letters to Zhou, demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan. They initially planned to meet at the Huizhong Hotel, where detectives were waiting in ambush, but the kidnappers failed to appear, resulting in no outcome. Recently, Yu A'gen, the Chinese Chief Detective of the Old Zha Police Station in the Public Concession, apprehended three Shaoxing gang bandits – Bian Guangxian, Mao Tingfa, and Zhang Yongkang – at the intersection of Xizang Road and Nanjing Road and at No. 310 Yunnan Road. It was discovered that they had committed numerous thefts within the concession, and they were handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Now, according to Bian's confession, there were several accomplices, who were scheduled to meet this Friday (i.e., the day before yesterday) at the Sanxingyuan Tea House, No. 5, Lane 932, Tangshan Road. Chief Detective Yu then led Chinese Detectives Lu Gengsheng, Detective Pang Ruiqing, Wang Shusen, Special Agent Zhu Shangwu, and others, along with Bian, to Sanxingyuan to wait in ambush. Subsequently, Chen Jianzhao, Xu Rengui, and Zhu Mingzhi from Shaoxing arrived one after another, and Bian identified them all as accomplices. The detectives then arrested them all and brought them back to the police station. Under questioning, Xu Rengui confessed that Zhou Jiasheng had been kidnapped by them and was currently being held at No. 12 Peideli, Zhangjiazhai Road, Pudong, and that firearms were also located there. Chief Detective Yu immediately led the original team of Chinese detectives, along with Western Detectives Smith and McKay, and French Concession Detective Zhang Ziying, to Pudong at 5:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, amidst torrential rain, to carry out the arrest in coordination with the Pudong Public Security Bureau detectives. First, the detectives ordered Xu Rengui to go forward and knock on the door. Zhang Xibiao, one of the kidnappers, opened the door, but as soon as he opened it halfway, Zhang saw a large number of Chinese and Western detectives behind Xu and, realizing the situation was unfavorable, tried to slam the door shut. However, because there were so many detectives, he could not resist, and the door was pushed open. Zhang then fled out the back door with his accomplices, Jin Fengxiang and Wang Baopin. The detectives guarding the back door immediately gave chase, but due to the rain and slippery conditions, they were unable to catch them. Western Detective McKay immediately fired a shot from his gun, but it missed. The three criminals were finally apprehended after being chased for about eighty yards. The other detectives rushed in through the front door and arrested Ma Liangfu, Ms. Wang Xie, Wang Xiangzhen, and Wang Xiangzhao, and rescued the hostage Zhou Jiasheng from upstairs. At the same time, Jin Zhou (i.e., Zhou's nanny), who was guarding the hostage, was arrested. A brand-new Mauser pistol with seven bullets was found under the pillow, and ten bullets were found in a box. With the permission of the Public Security Bureau, the captured criminals, hostage, and firearms were all taken back to the Old Zha Police Station. Subsequently, according to Bian's confession, another accomplice was hiding at No. 429 Buban Road, and detectives rushed there at around 2:00 a.m. and apprehended Ma Jinda, a native of Shaoxing. Yesterday morning, the police sent the twelve arrested individuals – Chen Jianzhao, Xu Rengui, Zhu Mingzhi, Zhang Xibiao, Jin Fengxiang, Wang Baopin, Ma Liangfu, Ma Jinda, Jin Zhou, Wang Xie, Wang Xiangzhen, and Wang Xiangzhao – to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division One. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation and requested detention in accordance with Articles 76 and 101 of the Criminal Procedure Law, stating that the suspects had committed numerous crimes and urgently needed investigation. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report, briefly questioned Xu Rengui and the others, and ordered their detention, postponing the hearing to a later date. Zhang Xibiao, one of the arrested criminals, had previously been arrested and sent to court by the police in connection with a theft case, but Zhang was cunning and the crime could not be definitively proven, so he was released. However, Zhang did not repent and continued his evil deeds. Now he has been arrested again, and it is unlikely that he will escape the law this time. The French police also apprehended another accomplice in this case yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Shooting of Ms. Hu Wu in Pudong; Four Robbers Arrested; Xu Jinlong…Hu Changfa; Yang Changfu…Pang Hongbin</h3>
<p>Regarding the robbery and theft that occurred at the small grocery store opened by Hu Desheng, a native of Qingjiang, at No. 71 Yongchangtian Road, Pudong, on the evening of August 8th of last year at around 8:00 p.m., Hu's wife, Ms. Wu, was shot and killed by the robbers when she went out the back door, entered the neighbor's house, and then went out the front door to call for help. The criminals fled in all directions without a trace. Recently, the Criminal Investigation Brigade of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau learned that the notorious robber Xu Jinlong (also known as Xu Jinbiao, 31 years old, native of Siyang) was hiding at No. 119 Taoyuanzhai, Pudong. Because the case had been delayed for so long, he dared to openly come and go. Therefore, at 7:00 p.m. the night before last, Detective Wu Xiufeng was secretly dispatched across the Huangpu River, together with patrol officer Zheng Xiheng of the Pudong Sub-bureau, to make the arrest. The criminal was arrested near Sanwanchang. Under interrogation, he revealed the whereabouts of his accomplices. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, Detective Liu Depu was ordered to take the criminal, along with policeman Lu Yinglin of the Pudong Sub-bureau, to No. 2 Yangjiazhai Branch Road to arrest Hu Changfa (37 years old, native of Huai'an, currently running a tea house for a living). They also went to No. 32, Lane 60, behind Tudi Temple to arrest Yang Changfu (54 years old, native of Guanyun, currently a manual laborer at an iron factory), and to a grass shed at No. 6 Hehuagou to arrest Pang Hongbin (32 years old, native of Huai'an, currently a manual laborer at an iron factory). The three criminals were taken back to the Sub-bureau. After a brief interrogation by Chief Zhang of the Sub-bureau, they were handed over to the detectives to be taken back to the Brigade for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Tongfu, Head of the Pudong-Songjiang District Defense Corps, Commits Suicide; Family Unable to Save Him Due to Intolerable Malignant Sores</h3>
<p>Wang Tongfu, 39 years old, a native of Shanghai, was the head of the Pudong-Songjiang District Defense Corps in western Shanghai. He had been suffering from malignant sores for some time, which were not healing despite repeated medical treatment. The pain became unbearable, and the sores were spreading uncontrollably. Therefore, he suddenly conceived the idea that death was better than life. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday, in his room at No. 177, he committed suicide with a rifle pointed directly at his heart, dying with a hole in his chest. By the time his family found him and tried to help, he had already breathed his last. They reported the incident to the police station, which ordered the local constable Shen Zhaogang to report it to the local court for inspection.</p>
<h3>Clues to the Assassination of Lu Rukang in Zhabei; The Bullet Found on Zhang Xiaogen Matches the Bullet Shell from Lu's Assassination</h3>
<p>Lu Rukang, a silk merchant residing at No. 9 Renxing Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei, was suddenly shot and killed by a group of thugs at around 6:30 a.m. on January 14th. Afterward, the police found a bullet shell at the scene and submitted it to the bureau for record. It is now learned that the Xinzha Police Station of the Public Concession arrested Zhang Xiaogen, a native of Changshu, 34 years old, who was illegally carrying firearms, at Xingle Lane, Avenue Edward VII, at 8:30 p.m. on the 16th. A six-round revolver with serial number 4553 and twenty bullets were found on him, and he was handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Zhang confessed that the gun came from Wu Yongsheng, a clerk at the Lidechang Tinware Shop on Nanwang Street, Nanxiang. However, it has been determined that Zhang's bullets match the bullet shell from the Lu Rukang assassination case. The police bureau is conducting a detailed investigation and research based on this clue.</p>

<h3>A Weak Daughter-in-Law Dies After Childbirth Under the Tyranny of a Ferocious Mother-in-Law; The Death Is Not Reported to the Daughter's Family; Claimed Death from Illness, But with Injuries on Her Limbs</h3>
<p>Wang Miaosheng, a farmer from Wangjiadu, Third Bao, Linjiang Township, Sanlintang Town, Pudong, had a daughter, Wang Cuixin, 24 years old. In May of last year, she married Xu Xiaodi, the son of Xu Xichun, who ran the Xushunxing Coffin Shop in Sanlintang Town. However, because her dowry was meager, she was disliked by her parents-in-law. In particular, her aunt-in-law, Xu Jin (57 years old), was known as a ferocious woman and treated this poor daughter-in-law with extreme disdain and inhuman treatment, which was observed by the neighbors. The young couple was harmonious, but they lacked the ability to be independent and harbored resentment that was difficult to express. Therefore, although Xu Wang Cuixin lived under despotic and tyrannical oppression every day, she was already pregnant. Last month, she gave birth, but her aunt-in-law did not take care of her and instead constantly physically abused her, causing the new mother to suffer severe injuries. She lingered on, eventually becoming ill and in critical condition. Yet, they did not seek medical attention, so she died unjustly the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, her parents-in-law secretly did not notify her family and hastily prepared the body for burial. Wang Miaosheng learned of this and immediately went to stop them, and reported the incident to the Second Sub-bureau of the County Public Security Bureau. Chief Hua of the Bureau ordered the police to arrest and detain Xu Jin. He also ordered the local constable to report the incident to the local court, which appointed Prosecutor Zhang and Coroner Shen to inspect the body at the scene. Xu Wang died of illness, but with injuries on her limbs. They filled out a death certificate, ordered the body to be prepared for burial, and ordered that the case be investigated in accordance with the law.</p>

<h3>Vegetable Market Fish Vendors Throughout the City Plead for the Fish Market to Open Soon; Recounting the Suffering of Exploitation by Various Trades; Deeply Hoping that the Fish Market Will Be Opened Soon to Relieve Them</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market, a joint venture between government and merchants, which has been prepared by Chairman Du Yuesheng, Standing Directors Fang Jiaobo and Tang Chengzong, and Deputy Managers Wang Xiaoxiang, Zhu Kaiguan, and Sun Guchen, held its inaugural meeting on the 10th of this month and took over on the 17th. All equipment and arrangements are now in place, and the preparatory staff have also begun working, deciding to open for business within the next month, to satisfy the longings of the fish merchants. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the stallholders in various vegetable markets throughout the city, including Wang Yuanzhou and Xu Danyun, petitioned the board of directors and presented it to Chairman Du Yuesheng, recounting the suffering of various fish trades and requesting the market to open as soon as possible. The board of directors accepted them and promised to adopt their suggestions. The petition is recorded as follows: The case is submitted to the above for review and approval. Representatives Chen Xiufang and others from various vegetable market representatives under the Vegetable Market Stallholders' United Benefit Association reported that recently, fish vendor members of various vegetable markets, seeing that the fish market site had been established for a long time, but fish vendors still had to go to the Sixteen Shops Fish Trade to purchase fish and could not purchase directly from the fish market, the fish trades in the Sixteen Shops, always regarded fish vendors as weak and easy to bully, and indulged in all kinds of means of oppression and tyranny, not to mention. For example, when a fish vendor purchases fish from a fish trade, once contact is made, they cannot but buy it, and when buying a bucket of fish, rotten fish are often mixed into it, regardless of whether the fish vendor can sell it. If they ask to exchange it, they are either shouted at loudly or beaten with old fists. Often, because the fish vendor insists on exchanging it or simply does not buy it, they are beaten by the trade members, and there is no one to whom they can complain. Also, the fish trades often mix ice cubes into the fish to increase the weight of the ice and obtain illegal and unexpected profits. For example, when buying twenty catties of fish, five catties of ice cubes are mixed in. If the ice is removed, there are only fifteen catties of fish, but the bill is still calculated as twenty catties of pure fish. Moreover, there is no standard for how much ice is mixed in, unless you know the trade members, you cannot avoid this kind of fish and ice mixed selling exploitation. As for trade transactions, when paying, if the fish trade owes the fish vendor two jiao of silver coins, they will only give two jiao of small silver coins. Some even delay payment by claiming that the accountant is busy and will not find it immediately, deliberately delaying the time, and the fish vendor, because they are in a hurry to get to the vegetable market and fear the trade's power, dare not argue, swallowing their anger and leaving. What is hateful is that they often take in the fish vendor's real money and immediately take out counterfeit money and exchange it with the fish vendor. The fish trades use all kinds of cunning means. How do they know that the fish vendors are operating on a small capital, and their parents, wives, and children depend on this for a living. After such an unexpected loss, a family of several people is in immediate danger. All of these are the great sufferings of fish vendors. In short, the fish trade sees fish vendors as enemies and is exhaustive in cheating and exploiting fish vendors. Now that the Shanghai Fish Market has been established, it is appropriate to give up the fish trades and purchase and sell directly to the market, to avoid all kinds of bullying by the fish trades. All fish stallholders unanimously requested Xiufang and others to report to your office and request the fish market to allow direct purchases. Xiufang and others dare not lag behind in the cause of promoting benefits and eliminating harms. Since they have been requested by various stallholders, they should report to your office. Based on this, the fish trade and the fish vendors have a close relationship in daily transactions and should be cared for. However, they are subject to various oppressions. Today, the market is declining, and the poor stallholders make a living by selling, and the impact is difficult to profit from. How can they be subjected to such oppression and exploitation by the fish trades? Yuanzhou and others are members of the fish vendors and are well aware of the suffering of the fish vendors. If we continue to delay, the fish vendors in various vegetable markets will be doomed. Considering the purpose of the government in establishing your market, it was originally to promote the fishing industry, develop fishing profits, and relieve the suffering of fishermen. And the fish vendors have a great relationship with the fishing industry. Since representatives Chen Xiufang and others from various vegetable markets have reported one after another, Yuanzhou and others dare not sit idly by. Therefore, a meeting of representatives from various vegetable markets was convened on the 14th of this month. The result was that the above-mentioned suffering of the fish vendors needs to be relieved. Therefore, it is appropriate to submit a document requesting your market to sympathize with the weak and suffering fish vendors and allow them to purchase fish directly from your market, so as not to be deceived by the Sixteen Shops Fish Trade. This will be a great benefit. Respectfully submitted, Du, Chairman of the Shanghai Fish Market, Wang Yuanzhou, representative of the Joint Office of the United Benefit Association of Vegetable Market Stallholders in Various Districts of Shanghai, Xu Danyun of Huainan, Ren Haizhou of Zhabei, Xia Kaicheng of Yinxiang, Qiu Zhensheng of the First Special District, Pan Lianfang of the Second Special District.</p>

<h3>The Trial of Mr. Graff, General Manager of American Oriental Bank: Defense Lawyer Beauregard Evades Questions, Case Too Complex, Hearing Adjourned, Graff Remains on Bail</h3>
<p>The case of Mr. Graff, a German national and the General Manager of the now-defunct American Oriental Bank, accused of fraud and embezzlement, has undergone its initial trial at the First Special District Court. He was sentenced to six months imprisonment and fined one thousand yuan. Graff, unsatisfied with the verdict, retained lawyers Chen Tingrui, Fei Sigaolu, and Man to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局), which initially filed the public prosecution against Graff through their lawyer Beauregard (博良), and Ru Baoyi (汝葆彝) felt that the initial sentence was not enough to atone for Graff's crimes. Therefore, they also filed an appeal. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing of the Second Branch of the High Court opened an investigative hearing. Graff was summoned, and Chiang Bao-liang (蔣葆良) was appointed as the translator. The three lawyers representing Graff, Chen, Fei, and Gao, immediately requested that the court order Beauregard, the Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer, to recuse himself from the case. After a debate with lawyer Ru Baoyi, the court deemed that there was no need for Beauregard to recuse himself and rejected the application. However, the three lawyers, Chen, Fei, and Gao, argued that their request could not be rejected solely by the investigating judge. They repeatedly pleaded and requested that the case be adjourned to allow them the opportunity to study and explore the reasons for the Shanghai Municipal Council's appeal. Judge Zhong, considering the complexity of the case, agreed to postpone the hearing. Graff was allowed to remain out on his original bail.</p>

The "Que Zhi Bing" (却痔病, Hemorrhoid Remedy) injection, patented and sold exclusively by the Shanghai Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory, is widely used by major hospitals and famous doctors throughout the country.

The formula allows patients to not feel pain and not have to lose time from work. The long term goal is for the addiction to be completely eliminated within a month. Since the center opened last year, the number of people seeking treatment has been endless. More than 100 people have quit smoking. To celebrate the one-week anniversary and to give preferential treatment to those who wish to quit smoking, he will provide free consultations and medicine for two months. A registration fee of only two jiao will be collected. At this time when the government is strictly prohibiting smoking, all smoking compatriots should quickly go to quit.</p>

<h3>University Entrance Exam Questions Must Follow High School Curriculum Standards</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 18th) The Ministry of Education received a report from the Peiping Municipal Education Association stating that when the Ministry of Education announced the secondary school curriculum standards in 1933, it issued an order stating that all universities should set entrance examination questions according to the secondary school curriculum standards to ensure continuity. However, according to reports in Peiping newspapers, some universities in Peiping are including Party Doctrine as a subject in this year's summer enrollment. The Ministry of Education's previously issued secondary school curriculum standards include Civics but not Party Doctrine. This not only makes it difficult for secondary school graduates to apply, but it also contradicts the Ministry's orders. The members of the association, realizing this, proposed that all universities in the country be ordered to set entrance examination questions in accordance with the previously issued secondary school curriculum standards during this year's summer enrollment so that secondary school graduates have a curriculum to base their applications on. The Ministry of Education is investigating the issue. Students applying to specialized schools or above this summer have completed their high school courses in accordance with the senior high school curriculum standards promulgated in November 1932. The relevant schools should base their entrance examinations this summer on the aforementioned curriculum standards to ensure continuity. It is hereby ordered that all high schools under your jurisdiction be instructed to comply.</p>
<h3>Hebei Province Decides to Hold Joint Examinations</h3>

Now, the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee has decided that the joint examination system is a central government regulation, and the results of this examination will be used for performance evaluations.

<h3>International Five-Team Track and Field Meet: Baihong Wins Championship</h3>
<p>British Army Lancashire Second with 35 Points</p>
<p>Major Players Absent Yesterday, Wet Field Resulting in Mediocre Performances</p>
<p>The International Five-Team Track and Field Meet, organized by Haiqing, was held at Beidang Bimei Zhang Gong School in the rain yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. About two to three hundred spectators attended, so it was not too deserted. However, Baihong's Fu Baolu, Sun Huipei, Zhonghua's Wang He, Wang Zhenglin, Zhang Jiakui, etc. were absent from yesterday's competition, and the wet and muddy ground after the rain greatly affected the results. Overall, the biggest achievement of yesterday's competition was Lancashire's Bowen's 220-yard performance (23.4 seconds, breaking the old record). Wang Xuewu's javelin and Jiang Huai's triple jump performances were also considered excellent. The overall result was that the Baihong team scored 67 points, winning first place. Lancashire scored 35 points, winning second place. Xilian scored 34 points, placing third. Zhonghua scored 19 points, ranking fourth. Mailing scored 10 points, coming in last.

Weller gained the championship due to his strong final sprint. Gou Lun ranked second. Zhonghua's Le Li, Fa Luo Ping swept the back two spots.</p>

<p>440 Yards: Ten people started. Famous player Dai Shuguo drew the innermost lane. At the sound of the gun, Dai Shuguo, Ma Changxian, and Qiaodun closely followed. Ford and Yang Nasi fell far behind. Because no one competed with him, Dai reached the finish line with a time of 55.2 seconds. Due to the wet field, the results were mediocre.</p>
<p>880 Yards: Baihong's famous player Jia Lianren did not participate. Lancashire's McDonald started first. Le Junchang closely followed. After 300 yards, Le Junchang overtook Mai Cengna, striding forward. However, in the last 100 yards, Le Junchang was exhausted. Mai Funa seized the opportunity, winning over Le Junchang by five yards.</p>
<p>One Mile: A total of thirteen people started this race. Xilian's veteran Xu Da released a kite, eventually failing. Lu Jinming took the lead by far, running more and more bravely, 30 yards away from second-place Hall. In the last lap, Lu's pace was relaxed, his attitude calm. He reached the finish line in four minutes and fifty-one seconds. Second place was Lancashire's Hale, more than ten yards behind.</p>
<p>320 Yards Low Hurdles: This competition originally had two preliminary rounds, but due to a lack of half the number of people, it was temporarily changed to the final. Sun Huipei and Li Houda were absent, resulting in the championship being taken by Xilian's Sique Mi. One Mile Medley Relay: In the first leg, Baihong's Dai Shuguo gave his all, throwing off the second place by about 30 yards. When Li Houda took the baton, he also abandoned it by 30 meters. After Jia Lianren got the baton in the third leg, he let go of his feet even more. Zhonghua's Wu Wenlin also closely followed. When running to 700 yards, he was chased out by Lancashire's Like Kai. Baihong's Zhu Guangzhi took the baton in the fourth leg and reached the finish line first with a relaxed pace. Xilian won the runner-up by twenty yards later.</p>
<p>Field Event Overview</p>
<p>Pole Vault: Only Zhu Hongying, Berlin, Boliden, Bailao, and Hall jumped. Fu Baolu and Wang He were absent. Pan Berlin was the first to be eliminated.

Mailing Hall ranked fourth.</p>
<p>Triple Jump: There were no particularly exciting highlights in this competition. The top selected Jiang Huai, Cui Lianming, and five others were selected.

<p>Javelin: As a result of the preliminary selection, Baihong's Wang Xuewu took the lead with a score of one hundred and forty-nine feet and two inches. Lancashire's Biling trailed by fourteen or five feet, taking second place. There was no progress in the final. Gu Zhaoxiang was not far behind. Laigen was ten feet behind.</p>
<p>Discus: Baihong's Leng Peigen was absent yesterday, which undoubtedly reduced the results. Bai Meng's Cao Jinkai used all his strength, moving to a score of one hundred and eight feet and four inches. Cheng Mengping struggled to rank second. Gu Zhaoxiang was behind Mai Ling Jin Genshi by a coin toss, ranking after him.</p>

<h3>Securities: 96 Public Bonds Drop Uniquely, Gold Certificates Remain Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange saw little change in market conditions, with most transactions being swaps. There was some short covering, and the trend was relatively stable. However, the 96 public bonds, which had seen no fluctuations for several weeks, suddenly declined. Most long positions exited, and there were quite a few sellers. This type of bond, which had long lost its qualification as a public bond and was勉强 (mianqiang, barely) listed among public bonds, only saw some activity from small capitalists who relied on its 利 (lì, profit). Investors naturally stayed away, and those who took long positions repeatedly failed to fabricate rumors. No one is likely to be fooled by it again, so further declines are expected. The unified public bonds, due to the 20 million still remaining in this month's deposit, had long positions concentrated in a small number of three firms, while short positions were scattered among small retail investors from various groups. The future still holds potential for change. Yesterday's session saw some short covering at the opening, with market conditions firm in the near term and weak in the distant term, fluctuating mostly by 0.05-0.10 yuan. The D-class futures were slightly lower by 0.25 yuan, with 16 and 47 being sold and 11 and 35 being bought. The settlement price of 13 and 20 saw quite a bit of buying, but the market price could not be unified and still had a difference of 0.05-0.10 yuan. The afternoon opening saw 13 uniquely advance in this month's B-class, raising by 0.30 yuan, which was completely unreasonable. Therefore, futures remained unchanged. Gold certificates rose another 0.80 yuan. Although the interest on this type of bond is low and the amount is small, most holders are various institutions' funds, and the amount of market liquidity is extremely small, so the market price has always stood at a high peak. 96 gradually declined in each session, closing with 96 down another 0.10 yuan, while the previous list remained firm and the latter list was already weak. The coming of change is probably still in the future. The resulting market prices saw unified public bonds all rising by 0.05-0.30 yuan, gold certificates rising by 0.80 yuan, and 96 uniquely declining by 0.35 yuan. The total transaction volume was 4.1 million yuan. The resulting increases and decreases are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Declines More Than It Rises</h3>
<p>According to a report from Sin Fung Trading Company, yesterday's (17th) New York stock market saw mixed increases and decreases, with extremely dull trading. Speculators are awaiting news of the new tax bill and want to quietly observe the development of the European situation. However, as of today, the New York Stock Exchange's trading volume has exceeded 200 million shares, which was not reached until September last year. There was some selective buying in the market, and the prices of several oil stocks with excellent first-quarter earnings were raised. Aviation, railway, steel, and utility stocks were slightly weak, automobile stocks were firm, silver stocks rose slightly with silver prices, and the small exchange and bond market saw mixed and slight declines. The full day saw approximately 1.16 million shares traded. The Dow Jones indexes are listed on the left:</p>
<p>April 16th April 17th Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 158.49 157.78 Down 0.71</p>

<p>40 Bonds 102.15 102.02 Down 0.13</p>
<p>11 Commodities 57.85 58.18 Up 0.33</p>
<h3>Yarn and Fabrics: The Yarn Market is Currently in a Waiting Mode</h3>
<p>After the yarn market declined the previous day, yesterday it presented an image of stability and tranquility. The market rose in the morning and was weak in the afternoon, but the market trading was exceptionally quiet. Both the long and short sides adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In fact, due to the approaching delivery date for this month, the long positions were held more firmly, but financial, gold, and commercial long positions remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Trading Quiet</p>
<p>The opening of the spot yarn market was marked by a gradual increase in market prices among sellers lacking business after the previous day's sharp decline. However, actual transactions were scarce. As a result, prices for each month increased by 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.8 yuan compared to the previous day's close. When the afternoon market opened, as it was a Saturday, business in the market became even quieter. Tat Kee and Shin Kee sold slightly, while Chang Feng continued to buy. However, spot yarn trading saw some activity in the southern ports. As a result, prices for each month decreased by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan compared to the morning's close. It was found that Heng Yi sold 400 bales, Ming De 550 bales, Ren Feng 400 bales, Jin Kang 650 bales, Tat Kee 850 bales, and Shin Kee 600 bales. Jin Chang bought 750 bales, Chang Feng 900 bales, Hsieh Cheng 550 bales, Ta Chang 450 bales, and Run Kang 400 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Not Bad</p>
<p>It was found that all groups bought a total of 857 bales throughout the day, with selling prices increasing by X yuan. However, thread prices slightly eased. The buying volume of each group is listed below:</p>
<h3>Cotton: Long and Short Positions Hold Strong</h3>
<p>After the large decline the previous day, the cotton market returned to a stable path yesterday. This is because Indian cotton, both coarse and fine, has recently seen its price increase by 10 rupees. Fine cotton has also increased by 5.6 rupees. Therefore, Tong Kee absorbed large quantities when the market price fell, with a particularly large amount. The inventory has reached 50,900 piculs. Generally, cotton merchants tend towards short positions. The future of the cotton market is still in turbulent waters.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton: Sudden Tightening</p>
<p>The spot cotton market in the morning saw a steady market, with American cotton rising by 1 to 6 pounds, Indian coarse cotton rising by 2.25 rupees, fine cotton rising by 0.25 rupees, and Osaka three-product cotton falling by 0.45 yuan. However, market sentiment was firm. After the previous day's decline, large investors remained still, and the trading floor showed signs of firmness. In reality, all floating chips were completely absorbed by the banking and gold industries. Since the general cotton merchants tended to sell, the struggle between the two sides was extremely fierce. The changes in the future are difficult to predict. As a result, prices for each month increased by 0.2 to 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon opening trend remained good, more expensive than the yarn market. As a result, prices for each month increased by 0.05 to 0.10 yuan compared to the morning's close. It was found that Da Fu sold 1900 piculs, Ju Xing 1200 piculs, Tat Kee 2700 piculs, Tong Feng 1000 piculs, Shin Kee 3600 piculs, Tong He 1000 piculs, Xin Cheng 2800 piculs, Xin Heng 1200 piculs, and Ming De 1300 piculs. De Da bought 1000 piculs, Jin Chang 1300 piculs, Chang Xing 8200 piculs, Run Kang 3000 piculs, Yuan Yu Chang 1400 piculs, Tong Kee 1500 piculs, and Hsieh Cheng 1500 piculs. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Pick Up</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption showed a slight improvement, with factories showing good appetite. The source of Yao cotton was X bales, and Tong cotton was X bales.</p>
<h3>All Brokerage Firms are Unanimously Buying, American Cotton Rises Across All Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with positive news from Liverpool. All brokerage firms, Liverpool, and Mumbai groups were unanimously buying. At the same time, rainfall was incomplete in Texas, and Oklahoma was sunny, which also contributed to the rise. Prices rose by 2 to 6 pounds in each month. Subsequently, retail long positions in May and July settled, and manufacturers bought spot cotton, selling futures contracts late in the session. The market turned weak, but the amounts sold were all bought at limit prices by brokerage firms. Hess &amp; Co. estimated factory usage for the week at 229,000 bales and Liverpool's inventory at 335,000 bales. The closing was firm, with spot prices rising by 1 pound and futures prices rising by 1 to 6 pounds. British cotton spot prices fell by 1 point, and futures prices rose by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton futures traders and speculators bought, but later settled due to weak news from Liverpool. Ping-guo-er rose by 2.25 rupees, Aum-la rose by 0.25 rupees, and Bai-luo-xi rose by 0.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 17th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai on the 18th, the opening forecast for Bai-luo-xi cotton for April-May was 201.25 rupees, up 0.25 rupees from the previous day, and for July-August was 203 rupees, up 0.5 rupees from the previous day.</p>
<h3>Three-Product Yarn and Cotton Slightly Down</h3>
<p>An Osaka telegram dated the 18th reported that three-product yarn futures fell by 0.90 to 1.10 yuan, with near-term prices at 196.50 yuan and distant-term prices at 196.90 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.15 to 0.90 yuan, with near-term prices at 65.85 yuan and distant-term prices at 61.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: The Local Silk Market Shows Slight Activity, but Yokohama Silk Prices Fall, Inevitably Affected</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local silk market continued to see sales openings, with activities gradually emerging for July contracts of White Factory silk of Robin Hood grade with 20-22 filaments. Birra Foreign Firm and Sin-Fu-Lin-Na and others successively purchased. Unfortunately, Yokohama silk prices were reported to have fallen, and Chinese silk was particularly affected by its competition in Europe and America. Therefore, transactions failed to see prosperity. The user silk market was very calm, and Lyon and London were also sluggish.</p>
<h3>New Dragon Well Tea Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A large batch of new Hangzhou Dragon Well green tea has recently been launched on the market. Yesterday, tea shops such as Yu Tai, Cheng Yu Xin, and Hong Yi Tai have already transported over 60 packages. It is heard that there are still large quantities being transported to Shanghai by bag.</p>
<h3>Black Tea will Form a Unified Sales Agency</h3>
<p>Since the Anhui Provincial Government decided to unify the transportation and sales of black tea from Anhui and Jiangxi provinces, various tea houses in Shanghai have voiced their dissenting opinions, holding that the survival of certain tea houses is at stake. It is now understood that, after repeated requests from Shanghai, the transportation matters will be handled by the province, while the sales portion will still be managed by a unified sales agency organized by various tea houses. It is heard that five experienced individuals will be selected from the tea industry to serve as standing committee members, with full authority to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Market Stable with Slight Increases</h3>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, prices for each month continued to show stability. Due to the reported price of foreign wheat, Chicago rose by 0.60 to 0.70 yuan, and Canada rose by 0.40 yuan. Market sentiment, due to the continuous rise in foreign wheat and the insufficient domestic bottom codes, naturally looked stable. However, although this month is old wheat, its price difference with June is still 0.20 yuan, so without actual sales business, no one dares to buy. Therefore, the increase is still small. For the distant months, although sentiment is good, it is the season for new wheat, so after initially rising by 0.01 yuan, it returned to flat. When the afternoon market opened, transaction volume for each month turned quiet, and prices rotated, with an entry and exit of 0.01 yuan. As for future developments, if factory sales are not smooth, a stable view should be taken.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Long Positions Take Profits at High Prices</h3>
<p>After the wheat futures market opened yesterday morning, prices for each month became firm again due to foreign wheat rising by 0.40 to 0.70 yuan. The opening price was 0.03 to 0.05 yuan higher than the previous day. Later, prices fell by 0.02 to 0.03 yuan due to long positions taking profits. When the afternoon market opened, transaction volume for each month was slightly less than in the morning. Due to sluggish buying interest, the market slightly weakened. The wheat market's situation, on the whole, can be grasped after another month. At that time, if there is hope for a good harvest, there will be something to talk about. The spot market remains stable as usual, and the prices of each grade have not changed. Shandong Yao Wan Ming Guang wheat opened at 5.32 yuan, with Fu Xin selling 1500 packages and Fu Che Feng selling 400 packages.</p>
<p>The drought area for American wheat has failed to receive rainfall again, and the forecast is for sunny weather. Flour sales and spot demand are both smooth. Without rain, prices are expected to continue to rise.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: April 16th April 17th Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>May 97.875 100.000 Up 2.125</p>
<p>July 89.250 91.875 Up 2.625</p>
<p>Canadian Wheat: April 16th April 17th Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>May 81.50 82.75 Up 1.25</p>
<h3>Hakka Xian: Stockpiling Households' Appetite Recovers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hakka Xian market saw its situation improve again, because the street's sales have continued uninterrupted. Yesterday, stockpiling households bought 1500 packages of Jiangbei machine rice. The stockpiling has been activated, and the market has seen strength. Although the selling prices are similar to the spot market, the backbone has already tightened by several points. Since arrivals have been weak recently, the market is mostly hopeful. In addition to the stockpiling households buying Jiangbei rice, the street sold 1300 packages of Gan rice, 1200 packages of Taiwanese rice, 100 packages of Jiangbei brown rice, and 200 packages of Anqing rice.</p>
<h3>Although Arrivals are Scarce, Rice Still Lacks Vitality</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the total arrivals from various groups were only on the 16th or 17th (a total of over 3000 shi). However, both retail and wholesale were slow. The Tianjin tobacco group only bought close to 1000 packages. Therefore, the market situation was not seen as strong due to scarce arrivals, but rather flat. The market prices for both thick early Japonica and thin Indica were indifferent. Du Yang Jian and Yin Bian Yuan were all stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were 24 or 25 boats from various rivers. The market's white Japonica sales continued in the early market, and prices remained tight. Later, due to rain, the appetite weakened, and the market showed a stable trend. Early Indica was fixed, and thin Indica prices did not rise or fall. Various Xian remained firm, Yin Yuan was firmly established, white rice was stable, and the other goods were indifferent.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Salmon's New Season is Approaching; Imports to Our Country</h3>
<p>Salmon, also known as "Dong Yang Yu" (Eastern Ocean Fish), is purely soaked in nitrate, so its meat is red and its taste is very salty. It can be stored for a long time without spoiling. It is produced in the Sakhalin region bordering Japan and the Soviet Union. Every year between late summer and early autumn, new goods enter the market. It is now early summer, and fishermen from Japan and the Soviet Union are preparing to go to sea to catch them. The production volume is very large, and the number imported to our country is huge. The most popular sales locations are Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, with the rest of the country being limited. Investigations show that this type of fish has been sold in our country for less than 20 years. Before being imported to our country, it was heard that the Japanese榨 (zhà, press) the caught fish for oil, which was used as fuel or other needs. The remaining fish pressings could be used as fertilizer for irrigation. Later, Chinese seafood merchants traveling in Japan taught them the production method, and the fish became what is now known as salted fish. Initially, only a small number were shipped over for trial sales. Who knew that its taste would perfectly suit the palates of the people of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces? Moreover, the market price was extremely low at the time, only selling for 3-4 yuan per 100 jin, so the common people were happy to buy it. Later, sales increased daily, and imports increased steadily. The market price also gradually increased. The highest price ever sold was over 16 yuan. Today's market prices are quite average, with good goods priced at 10 yuan and ordinary goods priced at 9.80 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Sesame Oil Continues to Rise, Hong Kong Actively Procuring</h3>
<p>Sesame oil's current周 (zhōu, week)货 (huò, goods) was heard to have reached 27 yuan, but the producing areas still had high prices and a lack of sources. Moreover, in the past half month, the raw materials have also been procured by the Hankou groups, so the Shanghai shops' intention to sell sesame oil is firm. Therefore, the weekly price was raised to 28.30 yuan. Yesterday, the Hong Kong groups suddenly inquired and transacted over 100 tan of Bengbu goods, totaling 300 cans, so sentiment was even better. The market immediately increased to 29 yuan. If sales from various routes continue to move, the market will inevitably change for the better.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Refined White Sugar for Re-export Drops by Five Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign sugar market remained stagnant due to slow sales, with a weak and unpromising trend. The association set the price for No. 24 raw brown sugar at 22 yuan for spot goods, 6 yuan and 9 jiao for re-export goods. There were no changes in spot prices for Dongchi and Dongbai sugars. However, re-export Dongbai No. 4 was at 6 yuan and 9 jiao, and No. 8 at 6 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, both down by five points. The factory's refined white sugar also remained stable, with Dahua Jinxin No. 1 at 20 yuan and 8 jiao, a price reduction of two jiao, and Zhenji No. 1 at 20 yuan and 6 jiao, a price reduction of five jiao. Only the Chaozhou merchants offered ordinary refined red sugar at 12 yuan and 5 jiao and a half. Additionally, half of Nanqing Longgang Qing Chedui Yuan was at 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was over one hundred packages.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits and Nuts: Black Watermelon Seeds Experience Sluggish Sales and Frequent Price Drops</h3>
<p>Recently, black watermelon seeds have experienced sluggish sales, leading to a weakening market trend. Dealers have been selling off their stock, resulting in a price decrease of about one yuan. However, inspections indicate that the stock in production areas such as Xuzhou is nearly exhausted. Dealers remain relatively firm in their stance. Nevertheless, due to weak demand, dealers have had to resort to price cuts. However, considering the limited stock, the market is unlikely to decline excessively in the future.</p>
<h3>Metals: Shortage of Black Iron Sheets Drives Prices Upward</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market experienced a shortage of black iron sheets, causing customers and manufacturers who needed this product to search everywhere. The market was unusually active, and the standard price rose sharply due to scarce inventory. Two-foot six-inch sheets were priced at 9 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per bundle, and three-foot six-inch sheets were priced at 9 yuan, both several jiao higher than before. In addition, a type of substandard sheet metal also saw its price increase due to a disrupted supply. It was priced at 8 yuan and 7 jiao and a half per bundle, also a jiao and a half higher than before. It is said that trading was quite brisk.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Locally Made Woolen Fabrics Experience Strong Sales and Price Increases</h3>
<p>Recently, sales of locally made woolen fabrics have become increasingly robust. Currently, brands such as Zhanghua 918, as well as British firm Jardine Matheson's Palmers &amp; Hughes’ French linings, are in short supply. Although factories are working day and night to increase production, it is still insufficient to meet demand. 918 serge has jumped to 2 yuan and 9 jiao per yard. Jardine Matheson's medium-thick serge is out of stock in the market. Palmers &amp; Hughes' light-colored fabrics are particularly scarce and selling quickly, with prices rising by over a jiao compared to the beginning of the week. Products from the Wuxi Xiexin Factory have also seen a surge in activity recently. Large quantities of corduroy and patterned flannel have been negotiated and sold. Remaining stock of the unified Dragon and Tiger brand woolen fabrics, which has ceased production, is being purchased by tailors and clothing shops. First-grade fabrics are selling for 4 yuan and 2 jiao, and second-grade fabrics for 3 yuan and 9 jiao. Wholesale purchases for immediate delivery can receive a 50% discount.</p>
<h3>Investigation: Shanghai Tea Export Situation in March</h3>
<p>According to statistics from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, tea inspection exports in March totaled 6,948.15 metric tons, a slight increase compared to the same month last year. However, the cumulative amount from January to March of this year is more than 22,000 dan less than the same period last year. The following is a list of tea exports in March (quantity - unit: metric tons):</p>

<h3>Which Path Should Children Take?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhaohe</p>
<p>In our childhood, we are preparing to enter society and seek a fulfilling life. Therefore, we must exhibit "sincerity" in everything we do and avoid any trace of "hypocrisy." The civics course in school teaches us this every day, helping us to cultivate a good character. Recently, society has been filled with darkness, and people's hearts are becoming more treacherous day by day. Children are affected by the entanglement of negative environments and the influence of harmful trends, which inevitably impacts our individual personalities.</p>
<p>"Sincerity" is the expression of innate goodness. Actions that are not self-deceptive or deceptive to others easily gain people's sympathy and support. It will be much easier to serve society in the future!</p>
<p>"Hypocrisy" is saying one thing and meaning another, not living up to one's words, and seeking immediate gains. Once exposed, one will be scorned and reviled, with no place in society. It poses a great danger to one's future life.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the two paths of "sincerity" and "hypocrisy" must be clearly recognized and decisively chosen. We must know which path to take and which path to avoid. Dear and lively children, please choose carefully!</p>
<h3>Yue Fei's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Ning Ziqiang</p>
<p>Children! When we talk about national heroes, Yue Fei is considered "second to none." During the Southern Song Dynasty, there were internal and external troubles, similar to the present situation. At that time, Yue Fei did not hesitate to sacrifice himself and waged war against the Jurchen Kingdom, achieving victory after victory, like a hot knife through butter. Unexpectedly, a treacherous minister named Qin Hui appeared in the court, ordering him to withdraw his troops and plotting his death, resulting in "failure just before success," which is truly regrettable. Ah! Enough digression, let's get back to the main topic and talk about his childhood.</p>
<p>Yue Fei was from Tangyin County, Henan Province. He lost his father at a young age and relied on his mother's needlework to support him. From a young age, Yue Fei received his mother's teachings and deeply understood righteousness. His mother tattooed "Serve the Country with Utmost Loyalty" on his back to show the meaning of "never forgetting forever." He also received instruction from Mr. Zhou Tong, mastering both literary and martial arts. Therefore, his ability to distinguish right from wrong, differentiate interests, and his loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, leading him to die for his country on the battlefield, came from his mother's teachings. As for his superb martial arts and strategic expertise, they were due to Mr. Zhou Tong's "patient instruction." Children! Our country's current environment is much worse than that of the Southern Song Dynasty. Everyone should learn from Yue Fei's loyalty to the country!</p>
<h3>Introducing the Children's Correspondence Club</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Mr. Ayrton said, "The twentieth century is the century of children." If we carefully consider Mr. Ayrton's words, we will find them to be very profound. Precisely because the twentieth century is the century of children, we should earnestly seek happiness for children and plan for all aspects of their lives in this century. Only then can we be said to be respecting the roots of the nation.</p>
<p>In the past, the Shanghai Yu Tang People's Education Center organized a "Little Teacher's League" to train little teachers. Now, to further train children's communication skills, it has organized a Children's Correspondence Club. The purpose of the club is to facilitate communication among children and to enhance their ability to express themselves in writing. The method of communication is divided into group and individual communication. The content of the communication focuses on children's lives, with written language as the main body and pictures and photos as supplements. The communication time is tentatively set for once a week. The exchange of letters will be the responsibility of the instructor, who will collect and distribute them every Monday. The club also has a postmaster who is responsible for receiving and sending letters. The stationery used for children's correspondence will be based on domestic-made envelopes and stationery. For internal communication, the stationery will be printed by the general office, and the envelopes will be made by the children in the handicrafts department. For communication with little teachers outside the club, the stationery and envelopes will be distributed by the Education Center to ensure uniformity. All exchanges of letters will be kept by designated personnel. Excellent letters will be published for observation and learning. These are the measures taken by the Children's Correspondence Club. I think it is a very good organization for training children. I hope that educational institutions in various places will follow suit so that children's interest in life can be greatly enhanced.</p>
<h3>Song of Spring Outing</h3>
<p>— Jin Hao</p>
<p>In the spring of 1934, when I was in Yichang, I often went to the mountains alone to watch people worship their ancestors and sweep tombs. Inadvertently, I heard a beggar singing a short song, which I found very meaningful. Now I write it down for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts:</p>
<p>Spring outing, spring outing, everyone treads,</p>
<p>Trampling on the green grass at will.</p>
<p>What does trampling on grass matter?</p>
<p>There is plenty in the world before your eyes!</p>
<p>The rich will bully the poor,</p>
<p>The strong will kill the weak!</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Plants, Animals, and Humans</h3>
<p>— You Mojun</p>
<p>Since we are human beings, we all know that clothing, food, housing, and transportation are essential to our daily lives. Although the scope of clothing, food, housing, and transportation is very broad, we must rely on the living things around us, that is, plants and animals, to meet these four needs. The relationship between plants and animals and us humans is briefly described below:</p>
<p>First, let's talk about clothing. In the cold weather, we need to wear fur coats, which are taken from animals. All wool products cannot be made without animals such as alpacas. Silk fabrics, as everyone knows, rely on silkworms, and silkworms are also animals. Cotton can keep us warm, and cotton yarn can be used to weave cloth. In summer, we often wear linen clothes, which all depend on plants.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about food. Animal meat, such as beef and pork; eggs, such as chicken eggs and duck eggs; milk, such as cow milk and goat milk; what we eat every day, what doesn't rely on animals? Rice and wheat are our main foods, which belong to the cereal family. Soybeans and peas belong to the legume family; they can be cooked and eaten, or oil can be extracted. Oranges and bananas belong to the fruit category. Moreover, there are countless vegetables. Even our favorite products, such as tea, wine, and cigarettes, what doesn't have a relationship with plants?</p>
<p>Let's talk about housing again. The raw material for building houses is wood. Furniture such as tables and chairs are also made of wood. As for fuels like firewood and charcoal, what isn't wood? Therefore, without plants, our housing problem cannot be solved. Moreover, forests can also prevent floods.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about transportation. Camels, horses, and cattle can be used for transportation or to serve us, such as plowing fields and carrying heavy loads. This shows that animals have a great relationship with our transportation. The coal and oil needed for steam engines and gasoline engines are originally ancient organisms; this is another example. Plants, such as utility poles and railway sleepers, are all made of wood and are also related to human "transportation."</p>
<p>From the above, children can understand the relationship between plants, animals, and humans.</p>
<h3>Ten Minutes of Science Teaching</h3>
<p>— Bai Tao</p>
<p>The Hot Trick</p>
<p>Everything mysterious in the world has its own laws. For example, let's take boiling water as an example. It is also based on certain laws: If we put the fire on top of the pot, it will never boil. That is because when the water gets hot, it expands and becomes lighter and rises, while the cold water sinks because it is heavier. Therefore, cold water and hot water convect up and down. Eventually, all the water in the pot will be heated. At the same time, air is also like water. When the air gets hot, it also expands and becomes lighter and rises, while the cold, heavy air sinks. For example, we use a thick piece of paper and draw circles on it. Then, use scissors to cut along the circles all the way to the center of the circle, and you will have a paper circle. Tie a thread to the center of the paper circle. Then, light a candle. Put the paper circle over the candle flame, and the paper circle will rotate. This is a very interesting trick. This trick tells us that the air above the candle flame, because it is heated, expands and becomes lighter and rises. This rising air is actually a hot wind. The hot wind blows on the paper circle, and the paper circle rotates.</p>
<p>The diagram above shows that the hot air in the stove rises; the diagram below shows that the cold air sliding over the ice falls.</p>
<p>When a fire is lit in the stove, the air in the stove is heated. The hot air rises and, when it rises to the wall of the pot, it transfers the heat to the wall of the pot, and the wall of the pot transfers the heat to the water, and the water heats up. We can also play a trick to prove that hot air rises. This diagram shows that the paper circle above the flame rotates because it is pushed by the rising hot air.</p>
<p>Hot air rises. Therefore, the stove is placed below, and the top is hot. But cold air is not like that. Cold air is heavier, so it sinks. For example, if you eat ice cream or shaved ice in the summer. If you want the water to cool down quickly, you should put the ice on top of the cup, not below. Housewives and restaurant chefs often put the ice in the top compartment of the refrigerator and put fish, meat, milk, and fruit…etc. below. This is the reason. Because the cold air that has slid over the ice sinks because it is cold and flows over the food, so the food is cold too.</p>
<h3>The Road is Not a Place to Play</h3>
<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I was walking on the road and saw many children playing there. This made me think of a sentence about our country in a Soviet textbook.</p>
<p>The Soviet textbook once described our country simply like this: "It is a country that used to be very strong but is now weak. The most obvious symptom is that many farmers no longer farm the land and go to the city to pull rickshaws! Many children are out of school and playing on the road!" How heartbreaking this is for the people of our country, especially "children are out of school and playing on the road." Although there are many children in our country who are not out of school and do not play on the road, we can often see many children who are out of school and playing on the road.</p>
<h3>Two Types of Children</h3>
<p>Such a symptom cannot be entirely blamed on the children. Why not give them education? Why not give them a formal place to play?</p>
<p>However, I would also like to advise the children playing on the road: If your parents are poor, you should also study on your own, because playing on the road not only wastes time but is also very dangerous for your life.</p>
<h3>Notice to Readers of Children's Friend</h3>
<p>The second collection of "Children's Friend" recently published by this publication house inevitably contains errors due to the urgency of publication. The first edition is now sold out, and the second edition will be published soon. All the typos have been completely corrected. We hereby announce this (Editor).</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: The "San Mao" continuous comic strip by cartoonist Zhang Leping uses children's movements as its subject matter. Its characteristic is that the pictures do not contain a single word or dialogue explanation, so that children and illiterate people can understand. The first edition of "Mr. Wang Collection" by Ye Qianyu, published by Shanghai Magazine Company as the first in the Comic Book Series, is about to be sold out. The issue is timed to coincide with Children's Day, so the Complete Collection of San Mao Comics has been printed. We would like to thank the company for gifting us a copy yesterday.</p>
<h3>Picture Puzzle</h3>
<p>— Made by Xuezi</p>
<p>Xiao Ling did not notice that there was a small river in front, so she fell into the water with a splash and shouted, "Help! Help!" Fortunately, her friend A Niu heard the sound. Although he has courage, he is faced with three such complicated paths, which require him to release quick means. However, A Niu is anxious.</p>
<p>Dear children, please quickly think of a way for him! Which direct route can be used to save the child who fell into the small river?</p>
<h3>What Kind of Person Will I Be in the Future?</h3>
<p>— Guo Chengzhi, Minglun Hall Elementary School, She County</p>
<p>(Twelfth Place)</p>
<p>The loss of the Northeast, as well as the North China Incident, has shocked the people of the whole country; even countries all over the world are paying close attention to these events.</p>
<p>How did these things happen? To put it simply, it is because China is full of dependence and seeks temporary peace, gradually losing its self-confidence, that it has suffered the oppression and aggression of □□ imperialism.</p>
<p>At this critical moment for the survival of the entire nation, if we want to seek a way out for ourselves, we must first seek a way out for the nation. Therefore, what our country needs most at this time is talents with scientific minds and military knowledge.</p>
<p>My ambition is to be a soldier who saves the country in the future; therefore, I am very happy to participate in and pay special attention to the scout training at our school.</p>
<p>Being a soldier! It is not like the warlords of the Northern Warlords of our country in the past, who used to bully the people and commit various illegal acts in peacetime. Such warlords can be said to be parasites of the country and public enemies of the people.</p>
<p>What kind of soldier do I want to be? To be honest, in addition to a scientific mind and military knowledge, I must also have the personality of wisdom, benevolence, and courage. Only in this way can I seek happiness for my country and win glory for my nation! That is also how I personally have obtained a bright road.</p>

<h3>Why Can Real Subsidiary Coins Be Picked Up by a Magnet?</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Now we have new copper coins and new jiao coins (collectively called new subsidiary coins). Children, have you seen them? These new subsidiary coins are divided into five types:</p>
<p>Half a cent (copper) One cent (copper)</p>
<p>Five cents (nickel) Ten cents (nickel)</p>
<p>Twenty cents (nickel)</p>
<p>One cent of the new subsidiary coin is equal to 30 old cash (that is, three copper coins from the Great Qing Dynasty or old national flag copper coins). According to this calculation, half a cent is equal to 15 cash; five cents is equal to 150 cash; ten cents is equal to 300 cash; twenty cents is equal to 600 cash.</p>
<p>Ten cents of the new subsidiary coin is equal to one jiao of paper money; twenty cents is equal to two jiao of paper money.</p>
<p>The new subsidiary coins are decimal: ten cents are equal to one jiao; ten jiao are equal to one yuan. (It used to be one silver dollar. Now paper money is used instead, and silver dollars are not allowed.) This decimal currency system is much more convenient and regular than the previous chaotic currency system—the previous subsidiary coins were divided into small foreign coins and big foreign coins; jiao coins also had more than ten names such as "medicine water jiao," "lead plate jiao," "private plate jiao," "Guang jiao," and "Jiangnan," which really made people dizzy!</p>
<p>Since the new subsidiary coins were introduced, people all over our country have found them very convenient to use.</p>
<p>However, where there is real, there is fake. Fake ten-cent and twenty-cent coins have now appeared on the market. Their patterns and sizes are exactly the same as the real ones, but the color is not as good as the real ones: the differences between real and fake subsidiary coins are as follows:</p>
<p>Fake: Grayish white, not shiny, soft, leaves a tooth mark when bitten hard;</p>
<p>Real: White as silver, shiny, hard, leaves no tooth mark when bitten hard.</p>
<p>Fake subsidiary coins are made of lead, and real subsidiary coins are made of nickel. We also have an easiest way to distinguish them: use a magnet to pick them up. Fake coins cannot be picked up, but real coins can be picked up. Because nickel is magnetic, it will attract a magnet.</p>
<h3>The Tale of the Righteous Dog (15)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>They did not refuse or deny it, but received him respectfully. The villagers gathered around, looking at him and whispering to each other, saying, "Don't you see him? He is the king of men, he is a great artist, the whole world mentions his name; yet he is just our poor little Nanluo, who used to be like a little beggar, relying on his dog to help him, exchanging bread and rice every day."</p>
<p>He thought about how he would put the fur coat and purple robe on his old grandfather and paint a portrait of him, like a saint in St. Clement's Church. He would also put a gold collar around Buddy's neck, place him on his grandfather's right, and then say to the people, "This is my only friend in the past." He would also build himself a white marble palace and a magnificent garden, from the slope of which one could see the spire of the Great Cathedral. He himself would not live in it, but would openly allow young people with great ambitions and no means to live there. When they praised him, he would say to them, "No, don't thank me—just thank the human painter Rubens. If it weren't for his masterpiece encouraging me, I wouldn't be where I am today."</p>
<p>He lived his life happily with these beautiful and impossible dreams, without any selfish ideas, and with the ambition of worshiping heroes—he was as happy as ever on Little Elo's naming day, returning to his dark hut with Buddy to eat their black bread, while all the children in the village were singing and laughing in the mill, eating round cakes and almond gingerbread. Under the starry sky and in the soft sound of flutes and harps, his companions danced in the large barn.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, Buddy, it doesn't matter, someday everything will change." He said this to Buddy, hugging the dog's neck with his arms, and sitting together at the door of the small hut, the cheerful laughter and music from the mill blowing over in the night wind.</p>
<p>From then on, Buddy often growled and showed his dissatisfaction whenever he walked past Corgan.</p>

<h3>A Country Without Women</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zi</p>
<p>Thessalonica, Greece Correspondence</p>
<p>A country without women – that must be a strange novel depicted by a dreamer. However, no matter how skeptical you may be, there is indeed such a country on Earth. And this land has been preserved from a thousand years ago until now. Although it has made no contribution to the world, it has long occupied a portion of the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>What's even stranger is that there are not only no human females here, but also no female animals. Naturally, there are chickens, sheep, and cows here, and they are the same shape as chickens, sheep, and cows elsewhere, but there is not a single hen, not a single ewe, and not a single cow – they are all male.</p>
<p>This country without women is not in heaven or underground; it is in our real world, eighty miles from Thessaloniki, Greece, south of the Athos Peninsula protruding into the Aegean Sea, at the foot of Mount Athos, which reaches a height of six thousand feet. A total of four thousand people live in this place, all men, of course, without a single woman. These men are not allowed to cut their hair, so here you can only see long hair and beards, and no bald heads. Of course, you can't see slicked-back, wavy modern hairstyles either. At the same time, in this wonderful place, all games, songs, dances, love, and even bathing and noise are prohibited.</p>
<p>On the cliffs of the Athos Peninsula, there are twenty lonely isolated houses, like birds' nests, each about a mile or two apart. These isolated houses are monasteries built around the year 900 AD, and are extremely magnificent high-rise buildings. In the middle of these are also schools, churches, and fortresses. The four thousand men of the so-called country without women live here.</p>
<p>If there were only no women among the many monks, it would not be surprising. What is particularly interesting is that in this country without women, there are many phenomena rarely seen or even imagined by people. For example, ordinary monks in monasteries that we know of live in a certain country and have close ties with everything there, even though they claim to have seen through the mortal world. However, this country without women, although within Greece, is an independent country. Moreover, this country also has its capital, called Karyes. In this city, there are also gardens, the sound of church bells, and oxen grazing in pastures. At the same time, there are schools, shops, restaurants, banks, and post offices, but you can't see a woman in any corner.</p>
<p>The department stores in Karyes, the capital of the country without women, are, of course, almost the same as what we usually see, with only one difference: you can't see any of the bright-eyed, white-toothed female shop assistants that we see in general department stores here; all those who greet customers are men with long hair and beards. Naturally, there are no high-heeled shoes or anything else that women need in this store.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that without women, there are no men, just as without men, there will be no women. Based on this common-sense reasoning, we can know that the men of the country without women are not born in this country but come from elsewhere. Although there are many reasons for these men becoming citizens of this country, most of them come here because of the troubles of women, because of unemployment, to seek spiritual comfort, or to escape punishment. Because these people are determined to end their lives here, they only pray and read the Bible sincerely from morning to night. In fact, it seems that there is nothing else to do.</p>
<p>This place is on the Aegean coast, and the cold sea breeze blows for a long time, so the winter is very long. But the people here still pray from morning to night even under the biting north wind and heavy snow. Therefore, in this country without women, you can always only hear the sound of church bells and religious singing. Other than that, it is a silent world of death.</p>
<p>The most sacred, oldest, and most powerful monastery in the country without women is called the Lavra Monastery. On the eve of Christmas, countless candles are lit in the chapel of this ancient monastery, shining more brightly than electric lights. All the monks come to participate in this solemn ancient Christmas ceremony. At the beginning of this ancient ceremony, two acolytes dressed in gorgeous priestly robes reverently brought out the Gospel book, decorated with gold and pearls, from fourteen hundred years ago. Then, the white-haired archbishop, wearing a gold and purple robe used for ten centuries, solemnly opened the Gospel book and began to chant hymns. The monks in the hall followed with continuous prayers, shouting in unison: "Lord have mercy on us." Thus, the ceremony reached its climax.</p>
<p>The monks here who live for prayer have, of course, forgotten women and all material pleasures. They drink barley soup, black bread, and salted fish. They get up at two o'clock every morning to work and worship in the cold wind. As for all their habits, they are unchanging until death, just as the monks of a thousand years ago did not bathe, and the same is true now. However, strangely enough, they rarely get sick, perhaps because of their carefree and thoughtless lives.</p>
<p>It is not easy for outsiders to come to this country without women. They have to get permission from the local authorities. As for women, they are absolutely forbidden to enter. Therefore, if women want to visit here, they have to cleverly disguise themselves as men. If several people come here at the same time, they will be subject to strict surveillance, because the people here are most afraid of women disguising themselves and sneaking into their country without women, and even more afraid of men and women coming in together and making love and performing frivolous comedies on this "holy land," which would "contaminate" them.</p>
<p>It is said that one winter, two Germans came here. Because of the snowfall, they were trapped in the monastery and could not leave for a while. Their wives, who were waiting near the border, became anxious and immediately hired a motorboat, crossed the sea, entered this country without women, and frantically sounded the siren to find their husbands. Although the sound of the siren attracted the two Germans, it also attracted the attention of the monks here, who chased after the two Germans in unison, shouting: "Expel the demons! Beat them!" A thunderclap, like an earthquake, shook Mount Athos.</p>
<p>In 1916, because the Queen of Romania came to the Athos Peninsula, the monks here also believed that</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>the holy land had been defiled. As a result, they constantly prayed for seven days and seven nights to atone for their sins!</p>
<p>In recent years, it is said that three Danes came to the country without women with proper permits. Among them, one, although dressed as a man, had a somewhat effeminate posture. Therefore, the monks were uneasy and gave him strict surveillance and secretly tried to examine him, but in the end, they still did not understand the truth. In this way, a big storm arose in the country without women. All four thousand monks talked about this issue. You said I was wrong, I said you were mistaken, and the situation was extremely serious, like a political dispute in an ordinary country.</p>
<p>Science Tidbits</p>
<p>— Seeking Truth</p>
<h3>Electron Telescope</h3>
<p>Recently, Dr. Zolkin of the American Telephone Association discovered an electron telescope that can clearly see objects in the dark. Based on the principle of Television (a device that can see distant objects by means of radio waves), it can transform invisible forms into visible forms, and can transform the invisible rays (dark lines or infrared rays) emitted by objects into visible rays. The discovery of such an electron telescope is, needless to say, a great contribution to science. With it, steamships and airplanes can travel in fog or at night, and bacteria that cannot be seen by ordinary light can be studied. Of course, it can also be used in military affairs. According to recent news, this electron telescope is also actually being used in photography.</p>
<h3>Exploration of the Stratosphere</h3>
<p>On November 11th of last year, the American Geographical Society and the Army Air Corps jointly planned an exploration of the stratosphere. As a result, the explorers, aboard the world's largest balloon, the Explorer II, reached a height of 72,395 feet (22,066 meters), setting a new world record for stratosphere exploration.</p>
<p>According to the explorers, the sunlight in the high altitude is stronger than on the ground. If you look directly at the sunlight through the window, it is simply unbearable for the eyes. However, the temperature is very low and the cold is biting, which is equally difficult to endure. If you look down at the ground from the high altitude of the stratosphere, it is completely a brown earth and a circular space. People and all living things are, of course, invisible. All that can be seen are mountains undulating like the waves of the ocean, huge rivers and lakes, which are especially clear when the sunlight is reflected. Looking up at the sky, it is a vast black world, and nothing can be seen.</p>
<p>The explorers in the balloon flying high into the stratosphere could talk to the ground by telephone, so everything they encountered in the air could be immediately known on the ground. At the same time, in their exploration, various scientific experiments were also carried out. Therefore, they could not only know more about the situation in the air, but also obtain many scientific experimental knowledge. For example, this American exploration brought many microorganisms from the ground to the stratosphere. As a result, many of these organisms died, and some were still alive, which is of great significance to biological research.</p>
<p>According to the prediction of this group of explorers, in the future, with more thorough preparation for exploring the stratosphere, they can at least rise to 95,000 feet. Indeed, mankind's knowledge of the secrets of nature and its skills in conquering nature will show even greater progress.</p>
<h3>Ancient Creatures of the Gobi Desert</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that the desolate desert area is not suitable for the survival of humans or even living things. However, since the existence of the earth, have there been living things in the current desert area? And has there been any cultural existence? This question is still under study.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the progress of science and the activity of explorers, the mysterious places that our ancestors could not reach in the past can now be explored by us, and many accurate knowledge materials can be obtained from this exploration to help scientific research and make it develop further. The desert area was also an unknown mystery in the past, but modern science has many reliable studies and discoveries about the desert, so that we can increasingly understand everything about it. What I want to say here is that there have been new and interesting discoveries in the Gobi Desert recently. This discovery is of great significance in both history and science.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the Gobi Desert is a branch of the Great Gobi Desert. There have always been many explorers to this place, and there have been many discoveries, but it can be said that great achievements have not yet been seen. Recently, Mr. Osborne, the curator of the American Museum, organized an expedition to explore the Gobi Desert. As a result, he discovered some fossils of giant beasts that lived millions of years ago, which aroused great attention from general experts. At the same time, several Swedish geologists also discovered fossils of poplar and elm leaves from the geology of millions of years ago. These plants are similar to those in present-day Central Asia, and this type of fossil is especially common in the east of the Gobi Desert. At the same time, there are many similar fossils in the Mojave Desert of California and other places. Due to these facts, Mr. Osborne, the curator of the American Museum, made the following statement based on his discovery:</p>
<p>Perhaps this place was a swamp at that time; the giant beasts that lived here centuries ago probably survived by eating those plants.</p>
<p>Why did these giant beasts all die out? This is probably because the swamps in this place dried up, the plants withered, and they starved to death.</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<p>— Liang</p>
<h3>Four-Eyed Fish</h3>
<p>The fish that are usually seen only have two eyes, but the American Museum has a fish that has four eyes, so it is called a four-eyed fish.</p>
<p>In fact, this four-eyed fish only has two eyes. However, because the iris of its eyes is very long and divided into upper and lower parts, the upper part faces the water surface and specializes in looking at floating bait, and the lower part faces downward and specializes in looking at the water, so, on the surface and even in function, it looks like four eyes.</p>
<h3>Rare White Animals</h3>
<p>You have certainly seen white cranes, white horses, white sheep, etc., which is not surprising, but you have probably never even heard of pure white apes, pure white frogs, and pure white porcupines. In fact, the New York Zoo recently acquired these three treasures. It is said that it is difficult to find one of these treasures among their millions of peers. But scientifically speaking, this is probably produced by people using genetics.</p>

<p>Confessions of a Working Woman</p>
<h3>Female Nurse</h3>
<p>— Interview with Ms. He Jiren</p>
<p>To be honest, my purpose in studying nursing was not initially because the profession had a charitable nature, but because it was a relatively easy way to find a job, so I spent three years and earned the title of nurse.</p>
<p>In the summer of the year of the Republic, I took a diploma from a certain girls' middle school, and with this qualification, I managed to pass the examination and enter a hospital sponsored by a church in the South City to study nursing. I studied there for half a year and paid 50 yuan in tuition fees. Because I was not interested in religion, I dropped out halfway. Fortunately, a relative who had just returned from studying in the United States introduced me to a charity hospital in Shanghai to continue my studies. The rules and organization there were better than those of the church hospital. There was also a school, with teachers for each department. After I went there, I could go out for one Sunday a week. As for class time, it was from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day, which was the same as ordinary schools.</p>
<p>Time passed like flowing water, and the six months of studying passed unconsciously. From then on, I began my internship. The first time I was assigned to work in the women's ward No. 3. There were seven or eight patients there, each suffering from different ailments, and each with a different temperament.</p>
<p>"Miss X, are you on duty? That's great! Let me tell you, there aren't many things to do here. If you don't have time, you can ask for help. However," she took a step closer and whispered in my ear, "Don't show that you're new in front of the patients, otherwise the patients will 'bully the newcomer'!"</p>
<p>She walked away with a smile. Many patients looked at me. Although I felt a little uneasy in my heart at this time, I couldn't show it on my face. After a while, a patient shouted, "Nurse, please cover me with this quilt."</p>
<p>I hurried over and helped her cover the quilt.</p>
<p>"Nurse, I want to get up. Please help me." Another patient's voice.</p>
<p>I knew she wanted to get up to urinate, but I had never done this for anyone before, so I felt a little hesitant.</p>
<p>"Nurse, hurry up, I want to get up!"</p>
<p>The voice was louder than before. I knew that I had to go. Enduring a belly full of unwillingness, I uncovered the quilt for her: "Okay to get up?"</p>
<p>"No, I can't. My waist hurts so much. Please bring that thing."</p>
<p>I took a glass urinal and put it on her bed, and helped her up. I stared at her, but she kept sitting there like a wooden puppet for five or six minutes, as if she didn't notice that I was standing next to her.</p>
<p>"Are you done yet? My hand is sore and I can't hold it!" I complained a little.</p>
<p>"Oh! Why are you so impatient, nurse? It's not that easy to take care of patients!" She sounded like she had been hospitalized for a long time.</p>
<p>"Nurse, please give me some water to drink."</p>
<p>Just after serving one patient, I hurried to the other side. Like a tea servant, I couldn't always be there, but when I heard a patient calling, I had to answer.</p>
<p>"It's too cold, this water. Nurse, you try it too. Can patients drink such cold water?" She put the bowl on the chair hard.</p>
<p>Although there were only seven patients in the women's ward No. 3, it was more tiring than entertaining hundreds of guests at a school art show. This day, I worked from 11:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. The seven hours of work were not very long, but I was so tired after work that I even gave up dinner.</p>
<p>After I started my internship, I still had four hours of classes every day, so on the second morning of my internship in the ward, I still had to go to class.</p>
<p>"XX! Yesterday, the first time you went to intern, a patient complained that you didn't take good care of her. You're absolutely not allowed to do that again! Nurses should take care of patients as if they were taking care of their own family members, and serve them wholeheartedly. You have to be gentle and not afraid of being dirty. These conditions are indispensable for being a nurse, do you understand?" This was a head nurse, and she said a burst of words like popping beans after class, with a stern face.</p>
<p>After being scolded, I felt extremely wronged in my heart, but I didn't dare to argue. After the head nurse left, I told an old nurse about what happened yesterday, and she also taught me a lot of experience. She said: "A sick person is almost like a child. Sometimes they simply don't have any reason. When a nurse encounters this kind of person, they can only try to be patient. Whatever they want, as long as it doesn't violate the doctor's instructions, just give it to them. For example, yesterday a patient complained that the water was too cold. This can be said to be common, because there won't be that much hot water in the hospital. Even if there is hot water sometimes, those timid patients will still complain that it is too cold. So when you encounter this kind of patient, you can only 'endure' to subdue them. Like yesterday, a patient in ward No. 4 had a fever. He was given a lot of cold water to drink, but he still said that he was burning uncomfortably and asked for more cold water. Imagine, if these two patients lived in the same room, wouldn't that be troublesome to death?"</p>
<p>Being a nurse really requires "patience". If I didn't still have some "patience", I'm afraid I wouldn't have been able to continue working at that time. The reason is that I was assigned to work in the men's ward in front after working in the women's ward No. 3 for a short time. The number of people in that ward was the same as in the women's ward, but it was more difficult to take care of the male patients than the female patients.</p>
<p>According to hospital regulations, the patients' temperature must be measured with a thermometer several times a day. However, some patients show an attitude of annoyance when they see the nurse coming with the thermometer, and some even pretend to be asleep to ignore you. Some patients are already asleep, so you have to tiptoe and gently put the thermometer under their armpits like a thief. When I first came here to take care of patients, I thought there was no difference between taking care of female patients and taking care of male patients. How could I know that after only one week of work, I gained a lot of experience. Some patients deliberately thought of many things to ask me. Sometimes it seemed as if they had made an appointment in advance to joke with me. For example, the patients lying on beds No. 3 and No. 7 had very mild illnesses, but that day, when I came to take care of them for the first time, they pretended to be very serious, shouting for water and shouting for "urine". However, male patients' "urination and defecation" are usually taken care of by the tea servant, so I shouted for the tea servant and went to get water for another patient. However, the patient who wanted to "urinate" saw that I only shouted for the tea servant and did not go there himself. His illness seemed to have healed in that second. He sat up in one fell swoop. Later, the tea servant ran over, but his "urine" was gone. In my months of internship, I indeed "learned" a lot about patients like this. However, it cannot be said that there were no "well-behaved" patients, but these were mostly elderly people or people with lung diseases.</p>
<p>There is also a terrible thing that I have to mention here:</p>
<p>I remember that it was one winter night, around 11 o'clock. The patients in the room I was nursing were already asleep, and the air was as quiet as an ancient temple. I was just looking down at a medicine book when the glass door suddenly opened. I thought it was blown open by the wind. When I looked up, I was so scared that I couldn't speak for a long time. It turned out that the person pushing the door was a male patient, with several layers of gauze thickly wrapped around his head, even covering his eyes. He pushed the door open and was still groping into my ward. Although I was startled at the time, I didn't panic. I quickly flashed past him and ran outside to call several tea servants to carry the patient away like a chicken. However, I heard early the next morning that the man had already been placed in the "morgue". It turned out that his head had been injured by a car and he had ended his life less than ten hours after being taken to the hospital. Last night, because the nurse in that ward had just left for a while, he had secretly walked out.</p>
<p>After being a nurse for three years, my heart is as hard as iron. Many people always criticize nurses in this way. In fact, according to my personal experience, it is not the case. For example, in my six months of internship, it can be said that I simply did not eat a good meal or sleep soundly once. However, later, because of the endless pressure of life, you can't help but be a "tolerant person".</p>
<p>The duties of a nurse are so arduous, but the treatment received is inversely proportional to the duties. After being in the hospital for six months, I only received a subsidy of two yuan per month. By the third year, it was only increased by two yuan. After graduation, I had to volunteer for the hospital for three months. After the service period expired, if the hospital could continue to employ you, you could be considered a formal nurse, but the monthly salary was only twenty-four yuan.</p>
