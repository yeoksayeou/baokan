<h3>日本充實軍備　對華對俄爲目標　軍部刊布小冊說明意義　廣大計畫期十年內完成　企圖實現稱霸東亞雄心</h3>
<p>（東京）日本陸軍當局最近對於補充軍備及其意義、新發表小冊子一種、大意略稱、目下日本補充其軍事力量之時機已至、一切障礙必須加以掃除、卽有犧牲亦在所不惜云云、因現時日本軍部各領袖與各政黨之間暗鬥正烈之際、一方面主張明白劃定議會與行政組織之權限、另一方面則堅持其所有之憲法上權利、不肯釋手、故此種小冊子之刋布、實値得吾人之特別注意也、該小冊內又稱、鑒於蘇俄與中國軍事力量之逐漸增長、爲國防計、殊有創立一種綜合的國家之必要、此外更開列增强日本陸軍之計劃大綱、惟否認此種計劃之將引起戰爭、或成爲國家不生產之浪費、復聲明軍部方面無否認議會政治、而實現法西斯主義軍事獨裁制度之意、唯一希望、卽欲對於全國人民之智慧實施普遍的動員、並按照憲法上之手續從事種種改革、以完成建立國防的國家之目的、</p>
<p>該小冊子又承認民衆方面有權過問得陸軍方面之十年增加軍備計劃何以需要經費二萬萬鎊之鉅、並說明日本外交政策之關鍵、卽在保障「滿洲國」之健全發展、促進中「滿」日三國之完全和諧、並鞏固日本在遠東之地位、使成爲該區域內唯一的安定實力、俾與日本國力前進相並行、該小冊子內詳列蘇俄英法德意各國陸軍之兵士飛機高射砲及機械化軍隊數額、以利比較、據稱、蘇俄在遠東方面共有軍隊三十萬人、飛機一千架、坦克車一千輛、並謂蘇俄外交政策之根本關鍵、仍與昔無異、不過欲使全世界布爾希維克化而已、蘇俄在東方之目的、卽爲日本、在西方則爲德意志、觀於蘇俄各首領之宣言、卽可明瞭無遺、蘇俄爲實現此項根本目的起見、故力謀與法國及捷克締結同盟、並與英國及其他歐洲列强訂立商務及不侵略公約、以便對德有事之時、不致多所顧慮、蘇俄在遠束之策略、卽從事設法煽動在東亞具有權勢之各强國、共同阻碍日本在亞洲大陸之進步、蘇俄自加入國聯之後、其在歐洲外交上之勝利、已灼然可見、更因其在遠東之軍備已擴充完成、自信有相當把握、故卽開始在俄「滿」及「滿」蒙邊境之區域內、明白作猛烈之威脅、並引起種種糾紛、有時更不惜違反條約、越過邊境、攻擊日本之戍兵、煽惑「滿」兵及當地土著、發生譁變、綁去「滿」韓人民、又在北部領海中刦奪日本之漁船、此外更有種種暴行、不勝枚舉、日本雖屢决提出抗議、要求賠償、皆置若罔聞、</p>

<p>（一）增加空軍之力量、</p>
<p>（二）增加滿洲戍軍之力量、</p>
<p>（三）擴充敎育動員及供給之便利、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>國際和平會議的醞釀</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>美國羅斯福總統將於下月親赴南美出席汎美和平大會。這個會議在性質上。正如昨日時評所說。含有新門羅主義的意味。但從別一方面看來。却也未始不可以說。這是羅斯福致力國際和平工作的第一步。據華盛頓電傳。羅斯福現正預備召集國際會議。討論維持和平辦法。無論此舉能否實現。羅斯福要為世界和平盡力是沒有什麽疑問的。現在華盛頓海軍條約。卽屆滿期。歐洲新羅加諾公約成立無望。而國際聯盟的力量。已到了最低程度。如果羅斯福乘着競選勝利的威望。毅然負起國際和平的領導責任。這當然是一件令人興奮。極有意義的事。</p>
<p>「國際和平會議」之召集。有沒有實現的可能呢。悲觀論者以為美國總統往往只有空談。而無實際。威爾遜總統提出了國際聯盟的理想。全世界聽從他的領導。待國聯盟的簽字過了。美國却臨時不批准。羅斯福在一九三三年也甘積極主張開國際經濟會議。待會議在倫敦舉行了。臨時變卦不肯安定幣價及减低關稅。更如柯立芝總統之提出非戰公約。胡佛總統提出史汀生主義。不承認「滿洲國」。在表面上。都十分動聽在實際上。都很少裨益於和平。所以現在羅斯福總統縱然主張召集國際和平會議。會有多少實效。還是一個問題。</p>
<p>就過去和現在的情勢看來。美國和平外交的前途。的確有着極大的阻難。不過我們也得承認。羅斯福目前的地位。至少和一九二〇年的威爾遜。一九二七年的柯立芝。一九三一年的。胡佛是不同的美國總統所以無法努力世界和平最大原因。在於國會上議院的掣肘。一個條約成立。要上院三分之二多數的枇准威爾遜的失敗。便由於上院的反對。現在。羅斯福有絕對控制上院的能力了。本屆改選。上院中民主黨得七十五席。共和黨只有十七席。而上院民主黨議員的當選。多半是羅斯福帮助的結果。所以羅斯福簽訂任何國際協定。國會不至於反對的。倫敦經濟會議的失敗。因為當時羅斯福對於國內各派經濟勢力。不能控制。故主張不定。現在他的對外貿易政策。已十分具體化了。他主張减低關稅安定幣價。以增進國際貿易。而最近美英法貨幣協定。及美國與歐洲美洲各國的互惠關稅協定。都表示這個政策的一貫性。一九三六年的情形。是不能同一九三三年相提並論的。</p>
<p>至於胡佛外交的有名無實。柯立芝外交的空無邊際。原因頗多。而這些原因。目前大部份已不存在。胡佛柯立芝個人的領導力。是十分低微的。他們的人格。遠不若威爾遜及羅斯福之偉大。政治手腕。也不若他們的高强。胡佛時代。美國在遠東的實力準備。很不充分。所以對於日本的抗議。僅有書面而無事實。經過了過去四年的積極增加軍備。美國在遠東的發言權。提高了許多。因為武力常常是外交的最有効後盾。如果史汀生處今日之局面。較之一九三一年當更有作爲。羅斯福不是威爾遜一樣的理想派。他是很實際的。他也許會善用美國在武力上財力上的優越地位。使國際和平從戰爭危機中得救罷。</p>
<p>當然我們也不能過度的樂觀。因為世界的侵略勢力。現在正在團結着。用各種方法破壤和平的企圖。華盛頓條約系統羅加諾公約系統。同國聯盟的的系統。都被破壞被毁滅了。要重樹世界的或區域的集體和平。需要很大的努力。需要偉大的政治家與堅强的决心。然而在一髮千鈞的目前國際局面。正是「饑者易為食渴者易為飮」的時候。我們希望「國際和平會議」。由理想而成為事實。更希望這個會議。對於遠東問題。至少有一九二二年華盛頓會議一樣的成功。</p>
<h3>美國復興氣象　百業旺盛前所罕見　工資增高失業大减　羅斯福開放世界第一大橋</h3>
<p>（紐約）羅斯福政府所唱「歡樂日復臨此間」之歌、現漸實現、目前美國商業已漸見旺盛、其盛况爲前所罕見、生活代價漲起頗高、鋼汽車·紙·衣服等業工資、均增加百分之十至廿不等、郵務部長法萊預料本年耶穌聖誕節前人民所購禮物之多、將為美國歷史上所僅見、失業者已由一九三三年最高峯之一千五百萬人、减至不足九百萬人、全國所付工資總數爲一九三〇年以還之最高額、本年農民收入毛數、共約七，八五〇，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元、羅斯福總統平衡預算與安定稅率之决心、已使證券市塲受良好影響、各項商業現復紛紛發給紅利與股息、（十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>日商　紗廠工人忍痛復工　條件部份政府再妥爲調處　公大第二廠工人昨晚復工　滬西內外棉第六廠又罷工</h3>
<p>大公社云、滬東區罷工之日商上海等各紗廠全體男女工人、經黨政機關派員勸導後、於昨日日夜班工人忍痛復工、滬西區日商內外棉喜和等紗廠、又發生工潮、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>滬東區　昨日復工</p>
<p>罷工之日商紗廠、於昨晨五時半、一面拉日工開工汽笛、一面派工頭及燒飯司務赴工房及工人住所、以威嚇利誘、强迫工入進廠復工、廠方深恐工人復工時發生紛擾、故通知楡林路及格蘭路兩捕房、事前派中西探捕沿途佈崗、以資防範、廠內亦有探捕駐守、及至日工放工後、夜工多數不願上工、旋經市黨部·社會局·總工會·派員剴切勸導後、故相率復工、工人在上工時、三五成羣、女工中含淚飲泣者有之、槌胸嘆惜者有之、情况甚爲悽慘也、</p>
<p>人數調查</p>
<p>茲經大公社記者、赴各廠調查復工人數、統計祗有七八成、茲錄之如下、</p>
<p>條件問題</p>
<p>關於工方聯合提出之五項要求條件、昨據上海舫織株式會社之人事科主任牧野中語大公社記者云、廠方除對工資已接受普加百分之五、及保管工人工作方面予以改善外、其餘如賞工等、視將來廠方情形好轉時、再行設法改善之云云、又據其廠工人代表吿記者云、各廠工人聯合罷工後、原冀廠方對全體工人所提出之條件、給予滿意之答復、詎竟事與願違、未能達到目的、工人在生活驅使之下、故忍痛復工、但十二萬分希望政府當局對工人提出之條件、籌謀妥善解决云云、</p>
<p>召集問話</p>
<p>市社會局於昨晨十時、召集各日商紗廠工人問話、到工人代表十五人、由調解股主任王先靑親自向工人代表詢問一過、因在華日本紡績業公會、對工方五項條件、的定昨日上午答復、迨至十二時許、日方仍未有消息到局、故無從商談、惟局方曉諭各廠代表、轉爲勸吿工人靜候調處、各代表於零時三十分始返、</p>
<p>公大復工</p>
<p>楊樹浦八埭頭、日商公大紗廠第二廠、自十二日晨全體工人響應罷工後、昨晚六時、廠方分派職員工頭通知夜班男女工人進廠、由人事科主任川瀨在廠內工塲前空地演說半小時、允許工方所提條伴增加工資百分之五、故夜班工人卽於七時三十五分一律復工、</p>
<p>滬西區　內外棉第六廠罷工</p>
<p>滬西宜昌路日商內外棉第六廠、全體工人八百餘名、於十二晚夜工時、爲　紗間女工被管工之日本人毆打、致引起全體男女工人離廠罷工、旋工方並提出要求、增加工資等四項條件、該廠工塲長中野嘉决平、請示總大班勝田後、迄未答復、致全體工人、昨日仍繼續罷工、又戈登路內外棉第八廠因開除工人、曾發生一度怠工、現糾紛尙未解决、</p>
<p>喜和紗廠　亦提條件</p>
<p>勞勃生路日商喜和紗廠第一二三廠全體工人，業已聯合提出普加工資禮拜升工每月賞工等六項條件、（其條伴內容與滬東區相同）向廠方要求去後、廠方尙無答復、現工人情緒激昂、工潮不知能免吾、</p>

<p>水淺難航</p>
<p>致運鹽水脚、自四元七角漲至七元五角、運煤噸價、自二元二角漲至三元五角、猶無船應裝、歷年長江落水、恒在陽歷一月至四月初旬、名曰枯水時期、今歲則在十月分、卽已退淺到難航之境、據航業界觀察、將來十二月及一月分之枯水時代、殆退落至與現定水標尺之起點度、屆時滬上六公司輪、必致無一船可以通航矣、一般客家、亦甚憂慮、議將改由</p>
<p>鐵道轉運</p>
<p>其辦法下水貨自平漢路轉隴海路、趨海道　到上海、而上海去貨、則裝到連雲港、轉隴海路接平漢車前往、如此、可使貨運不致阻斷、惟水脚須較昻也、至小長江一路（卽通揚上海叚）本年因江北各地雜糧棉花、亦皆豐收、屯貨至多、亟待裝滬、此路原爲大達大通兩公司船往來行駛、今因貨擁、原有八輪、不敷供應、聞該兩公司已議定增加班决、擴大運量、業將大振航業公司泳安輪、崇明輪船公司天賜輪租賃、加入此綫內行駛、的在本月十五日卽可增航、</p>

<h3>本年七八兩月份　上海工商業異動概况（續）　（上海工商業概况之卅八）</h3>

<p>七月份販賣商業新創者較上月增二家，閉欺者較上月份亦增五家，實有繼上月份而續趨衰落之勢，其中較重要者略如下列：</p>

<h3>鐵爾登講網球方法　李惠堂記</h3>
<p>大名鼎鼎的「威廉鐵爾登二世」用不着我來介紹、相信稍爲注意網球或明瞭世界運動的人們、對他豆油相當認識了這一回他和那少年英俊的「愛士華梵恩斯」聯袂東來獻技、鼓盪起東亞網球家無限的興奮、從前在報章或雜誌上披讀他們的成績、或者有時在銀幕上驚鴻一瞥地看他們爽快的身手、總以未能身歷其境親賞絕藝而引爲大憾、到今日還算我們緣份不慳、眼福不薄、竟能在香島有親瞻丯采的機會、而筆者更能進一步和他們握手暢談、允覺特殊的欣幸、</p>
<p>十一月九日下午六時又半、鐵氏與梵氏表演賽畢、乃在香港大酒店大台花園裏作公開演講、一時慕名而集者數百人、在六十分鐘裏面、鐵氏大談球經、娓娓動聽、他手裏還抱着球拍、導示各種握拍法、幷時表演各項擊法姿勢、他鶴形的寬背、明太祖式的下頷、道地美國的口嗓、無一是引人發噱的資料、何况他還時時雜以滑稽的口吻、詼諧的動作、談吐風生、惹得笑聲四座、他不特是一位生就的網球怪傑、同時也是一位富有天才的演講家、以下簡記的是他談話的要點、</p>
<p>一般人的錯誤</p>
<p>很多人根本上觀念錯誤、以爲網球之戲、手握球拍、全賴手之動作，其實大謬不然、蓋網球爲物、智力·目光·身體推動力、聯合運用、始收奇效、握拍之手、不過專司傳達之工作而已、還有最握要的便是足部的動作、較手的動作允應注意、步伐錯亂、鮮有佳妙表演、平常人更有誤會、以爲網球之一始一終、卽在球拍擊球之一剎那、其實球未與拍接觸前卽已開始、而拍雖擊球去後仍未可認爲吿終也、</p>
<p>網球三大原則</p>
<p>網球之基本原則有三大點、第一、即自球開始發出後至球死爲止、兩目宜緊視球兒、視綫集中、不可爲塲外景物所轉移、很多球員目雖隨球、但有時球到身旁卽昂首視察對手之地位、而忘目隨球與拍接觸時之片刻、而致有時擊球之點、並不在拍之中央、殊爲智者不取、上乘好手、不須視察對手所站地位、蓋網球秘訣、全在擊球遠離敵身、並非擊向敵之身旁、俾其較易回擊也、第二第三兩點、有相連關係、卽擊球時必將己身轉動、側面向網、如面網擊球、决難有佳作、球拍撞球時、身體同時應有向前推動力、以增加球勢、故初學網球者、宜對此三點有深切的瞭解、將己身姿勢訓練純熟、始再進一步、以求擊法、否則基礎錯誤、斷難有偉大收穫耳、</p>
<p>最扼要的擊法</p>
<p>網球擊法雖有多種、惟最扼要而最常用者、厥爲正手抽擊、苟正抽不佳、則雖其他擊法高妙、亦難望踏上世界覇壇、抽球時左足宜提前、側身向網、俟球達腰之高度時迎擊、球來過高、則俟其墜下至與腰齊始擊之、過低應屈膝蹲低以擊、始合步驟、反手抽擊、擊法與正抽同一原則、祇左右轉換而已、發球爲物、人多以爲球賽發　之媒介而忽視之、殊不知發球乃進攻之利器、球員宜用心熟習、勿放棄此攻襲之權利、發球雖種類不一、然有實用者祇二種、一爲偏切式、一爲美國旋轉式、至於高壓球·飛來球切球·低沉過網球·挑球·半飛來球·飛來挑球·種種擊法、均有其本身價値、惟訓練擊法、須先求準確、徐圖速率始收事半功倍之效、</p>
<p>男女間之歧異</p>
<p>人每以男女網球之岐異爲問、余以爲女界因天賦體質關係、祗宜於底綫戰術、不宜網前戰法、男子則不同、實體上以底綫戰術爲主、心智上以網前戰法爲主、一有機會、卽宜上網截殺、女子氣力不充、殊難應付裕如、至於擅長抽者、必可勝擅攔網者、經騐及已往成績、昭吿不訛、然遇彼此長抽勢均力敵時、則兼擅守網者、又必佔便宜、可無疑義也、</p>
<p>聽講人的印象</p>
<p>鐵氏演講已完、乃由座中之人發問疑難之點、由其逐一解答、頗饒異味、其中多本人經騐之談、總之、那天晚上的一句鐘、是人們都深印在腦海間的、是人們均認爲不負此打的、祗可惜的是他那晚所談出討論的都是初學的基本原則與方法、大凡讀過他所著的那本「球賽秘訣與球之迴旋力」的人、都知道他今次所講的都是加點動作、陳章再贄、在那本齊中已發揮透切了、那天晚上的聽衆、多是有點網球根底和閱歷的人、他應該把他生平的經騐和球賽較爲高深的奧妙參雜指導、才更有趣更有價値、雖則無論那一種運動、斷非一朝一夕或一聽一講間便可進步的、</p>
<p>鐵爾登與潘萊</p>
<p>很多人的意思、以爲鐵氏生性有點古怪、脾氣也異乎常人、他有時文字或口頭上的評議、是會固執而存偏見的、他年前看小英歐的名手「佛烈潘萊」、說他的擊法謬誤、難成大器、今日潘氏高踞皇座、鐵氏仍不改古調、常說德覇王「馮格林姆」、是一較優人材、所以英國人七都不大歡喜鐵氏、雜誌和報章上時有抨擊他的文章、但仁者見仁、智者見智、鐵氏也可別有會心、也許他獨具隻眼、是是非非、誰能有準切確實的判斷、</p>
<p>鐵梵兩氏球藝</p>
<p>這兩天他們在港表演、眞算我們眼福不　、他們發球之　勁、應戰之從容、長抽之準確、姿態之優美、步驟之不亂、不特是前無古人、恐怕後此也不會有來者、因爲日後縱有好手蒞臨、但對抗無人、難引得出他們的精彩微妙之點、總之、他們這决的光臨獻技，確足使我人張目、她們的超羣壞技、不由得你不自動地拍掌呌絕、認爲藝術最高峯、</p>
<h3>林肯輪有遲到說</h3>
<p>鐵梵二决表演恐不及如期鐵爾登梵恩斯於歸國途中、定本月二十日重經上海、已定作第二次之獻技、一切均已準備就緒、昨晨、卡那凡洛處忽得林肯輪因故有脫遲班期之語、故是否能準期於二十日表演、尙未可必、現卡等已急電詢問眞相、的今日可得確復、據記者另向中國旅行社詢問、據云未曾聞悉、至門券已於昨日開始在時評洋行發售、果該輪遲判、迨表演時仍可通用云、</p>

<h3>紗花　棉產估計减缩　棉花漲風重熾　陳粗絨復有出口傳說</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、漲風復熾、良以市傳綿產估計有减縮至一千四百萬擔之風說、比上次之數量、减少二百萬擔外、同時又說陳粗絨棉七千　、裝運出口、於是人心震盪、浮空抵補、市盤乃邁步前進矣、</p>
<p>標花近遠漲七八角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、近月市態甚硬、因連日下降爲數已鉅、引起獲利者扒補、市盤緩步上升、雖海外印美棉市一味下墮、仍難遏止人心也、實以浮戶拗賣太多、反動回好、加之市塲傳說、謂棉產估計有减縮之患、於是賣戶缺乏、市象轉挺、結果各月比上日收盤價漲一角半、午後開盤、各月猛跳、氣勢頗堅、謠肓紛紜、粗絨棉有出口消息、浮戶扒空心思允切、市價節節上漲、結果各月比上午收盤價再漲三角半至五角半、查賣出潤康五千七百擔、興昌五千八百擔、晋康一千八百擔、昶記一千七百據、聚興三千二百擔、源大三千五百擔、錦昌六千二百擔、明華二千一百擔、愼昌二千三百擔、泰昌七千二百擔、生源二千五百擔、福康四千六百擔、信誠三千九百擔、益康三千一百擔、源興昌四千九百擔、買進明德三千六百祖、豐泰四千担、愼記四千二百担、大昶二千担、同和二千担、賡豐四千四百扭、仁豐六千二白担、元一五千二百担、大昌成七千五百担、恒益一萬二千八百担、合興五千擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>利多之謠復盛　棉紗反動回升　本月多頭拉力亦强</h3>
<p>纱市晨平午漲、局勢轉趨緊俏、　以原棉上升、大阪一品紗市近期回高、人心良好、多方對於近月紗做作仍力、因倉庫存紗薄弱之故、但現紗生意並未十分暢達、本日成交雖有二千包左右、其中有一半係同業中購進做心思也、</p>
<p>標紗回漲二元左右</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、本月因十日跌風太烈、反動回升、復達二百三十元、但拍至遠期轉趨軟弱、二盤以後、聞大阪三品紗市回挫、兼之現紗銷塲並未十分暢健、大戶又來吐出、檯而忽鬆、市盤轉向下落、結果一·二·月期比上日收盤價均漲一角、其餘勿動、午後開盤、近月份市况頗挺、因公債趨漲、市塲傳言膨脹通貨事復提、二盤以後、買氣更濃、市價步步上升、結果各月比上午收盤價漲一元七角至二元八角、查賣出恒益一千二百五十包、聚興一千二百包、森康九百五十包、大孚六百五十包、裕大一千九百五十包、錦昌三千五百五十包、明德二千八百包、興昌二千六百包、大昌成一千六百包、瑞大八百五十包、協成七百包、買進大豐一千八百五十包、昶記一千二百包、愼記三千四百包、泰昌一千三百包、益昶一千二百包、大昶二千六百包、望泰興一千一百包、長豐三千四百五十包、潤康一千六百包、豐泰八百包、通訊八百包、賡豐七百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>美棉賣方壓力甚重</h3>
<p>昨日美棉開盤、利物浦消息不佳、利物浦帮賣出、多頭了結、及棉農套賣、各月跌四至—六磅音、旋以同業逢跌買進、略見站定、惟賣方壓力甚重、買方則恃銀價疲軟爲主、華盛頓方面消息、農長華萊士或將贊成停止新棉管理計劃、直至大量生量引起大量過剩、市價—分跌落爲止、其後合作社賣出、市價益疲、收盤時一部份補空、略形平穩、計現貨跌四磅音、期貨跌四至十六磅音、英棉現貨跌六點、期貨跌三至五點、印棉因據報奧姆辣棉區繼續風雨、歐洲出口商買進奧姆辣而漲、後因利物浦消息不佳而回、計平果爾跌〇·二五羅比、奧姆辣不動、白羅溪跌一。五羅比、原電錄左、（十二日電）</p>

<h3>疋頭　棉布廠盤遠期較鬆</h3>

<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、以洋麥漲落互見、氣象平和、一時無接近形勢、獲利浮空、紛起抵補、市塲人心、鑒於現麥鞏固、各地來源、運輸淤阻、而盤面與高峰已相離三角許、漸滋向上之心、故上午開盤、遠近各月即躍升五六七分不等、迨後粉市報漲、興緻允形濃厚、各月漲勢、均達角外、惟升勢過銳、略有浮多回出、午後局勢、漸趨穩定、各月較前日漲起一角至一角二分、現麥以期貨升騰、賣方扳持益力、故成交仍鮮、僅申大進淮安麥四百包、價五元九角二分外、其餘均乏做開云、</p>

<h3>粵帮暢辦砶糙米</h3>

<h3>家庭建設</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>國家，果然是需要建設，家庭，也需要建設。而家庭建設的責任，無疑地，是該婦女負着較大的責負的。因此，我特把這問題，提出討論。</p>
<p>家庭的建設，是該劃分為二大部，　物質建設，　精神建設。</p>
<p>物質建設，可分成下列數項。　家庭的整齊，如一切物件傢具的安置，均有適當的地位，而顯着是相當的美觀。　清潔衛生。如門窗地板等的時常拂拭灑掃。衣服臥具等的時常洗滌消毒。食牧飲料，須蒸熟煮透，酸腐或不潔的，絕對擯棄不用。在疫癘發生的季節中，如天花，霍亂，瘧疾，傷寒等流行的時季，須努力預防，以防傳染病的發生或侵襲。　確立預算，以撙節開支，而减少無　的耗費，　努力儲蓄，以樹立家庭經濟穩固的根基。　提倡運　，與高尚的娛樂，如往公園散步，往郊外旅行。擊球，如網球或乒乓球等。參觀模範家庭，開家庭茶話會，交換智識或意見，定閱有益的書報，以增長智識，奏弄音樂箏等。　提倡家庭工業，如編織，針　以及兒童們的竹工木工等等。</p>
<p>精神建設，可分成下列數項。　家庭中靜穆空氣的造成。如談話時，不故意高聲。器物的安放，不粗率。兒童們不敲檯槃桌。平時不作忽遽的奔跑聲。　家庭中。和陸空氣的造成。夫歸間一切問題。都絕對的公開，都把着互諒互恕的態度。對於子女，甚麼都循循善誘，絕不扑撻呵罵。對於傭僕，以感化為主，不以疾言厲色相加。　好整齊，好清潔，好運較的習性養成。　同情心與互助心的養成，但不涉於迷信。　冒險而勇敢的精神的養成，但須不獷暴輕率，同時，更須有忍耐的訓練，但絕對不是懦怯。對於子女們訓練時，更須留意。　養成節儉的習性，但以不吝嗇為度。　愛好勤勞的習性的養成。更其是須使子女，每天作家庭服役若干時，以養成其勤勞而負責的習慣。　說話，須坦白而誠實，不設謊，不隱瞞，不作無謂的戲譴。在和悅之中，顯示灣尊嚴。　摒絕烟酒，脂粉，及非必要的糖果食物等奢侈品，而一切家庭用品，須儘可能帥採用國貨。</p>
<p>在物質與精神，都合乎標準的家庭之中，生活着的人物，無疑地，必然是社會上的優秀份子。更其是從這種家庭中，所訓練出來的子女，必然的是國家的優等小國民。但是不長進的國民，是無益而有害的國家民族的。要造成優良而能負發揚光大之責的，我們須先從家庭建設努力起。願全國家庭的主婦們，起而直接努力於家庭的建設，間接的，促成着社會與國家的建設。</p>
<h3>一個抗敵女英雄</h3>
<p>— 范顯微</p>
<p>民國紀元前五十二年，庚申，清咸豐六年，英法聯軍，進陷天津，直逼北京，焚圓明園，文宗避難熱河，勢如破竹，清祚危如纍卵！幸俄使伊格那提出任調停，乃訂「立北京條約，那我國的九龍半島，就是在這一役裏割給於英國的；他如開埠，賠欵，損失實不可勝計，當時咱們中國兵所賴以捍衛疆土的，只有那些手執刀槍的藤排兵，至於軍火，也只不過前鏜槍一種而已！當然那能敵得過他們幾千幾百噸的巨艦，飛鋒也似的大炮？可是那時侯，圓明園旁有一個女英雄，目擊那外侮的日亟，國社危在旦夕。於是揭竿起義，奮勇，敵抗；無奈寡不敵衆，終遭敗績，但以一個弱女子而能奮不顧身，抵禦强悔，着實也值得我們崇拜哪！</p>
<p>女英雄「名婉貞，馮姓，原籍山東，年十九，父名三保，精技擊，聯軍之役，伊家裏恰巧住在距圓明園十里的謝莊，因為伊自小就從父習技，所以拳棒着實不錯，當聯軍焚燒圓明園的當兒，伊不願那謝莊也落於敵人之手，集合莊少年如要人，玄衣白刃，保衛鄉里，伏於森林陰處，未幾，敵騎舁砲至女出共不意，率衆揮刀奮斫，夾擊之，縱橫跳盪，所向無不披靡！西兵大挫，都棄砲而遁，死傷無數，幸以衆寡懸殊，只得敗退下來，這一頁抗敵史，恐正史不傳，特錄之以勗來茲</p>
<h3>光榮的婦女</h3>
<p>— 方麗君</p>
<p>西康通訊</p>
<p>這是我們中國固定的鐵圈，從古來的社會，便是男性中心的社會；女子們不過是男性們的附屬品而已，所以，在中國的社會上根本沒有女性們的地位，這是鐵一樣的事實擺在我們目前的。然而，我們反顧一下西康婦女們以及伊們社會的現狀，那麼，又將使我們奇怪得不信起來了；因為，西康的習慣是和我們完全不同的，換句話說，就是恰成了一個反比例</p>
<p>西康社會的狀况；男性們除了狩獵及奔往異鄉去經商而外，其他如家庭中一切雜務事情等，都是由婦女們來全力担負去的。進一步的講，卽如城市裏的各家商店中的職員，也完全清一色地由伊們服務着，勤幹着。因為，西康的社會是以婦女們為中心的。</p>
<p>因為是婦女中心的社會，於是就和以男性為中心社會的地帶一樣。在西康的流行着一妻多夫的制度，正和這裏一夫多妻的制度互相的對峙着。這也許是環境及傳統的觀念所造成的吧！</p>
<p>伊們對於男女間的社交是公開的，自由的；伊們並沒有舊禮教封建的束縛。到於兩性之間的關係，祗要男女雙方都同意，便可以自由地結合了。而且，有些婦女甚至和一個男性發生了愛或其他關係的時候，還沒有將意見貢獻給伊們的父母。事後才去告知，而再舉行簡單而輕快的結婚儀式。</p>
<p>至於西康農村中的婦女生活呢？伊們的工作是繁雜而忙碌的，辛辛苦苦地從播種，施肥，以至耕耘，收穫等等的事情，都是伊們的任務。而外，兼業畜牧的婦女也很多根多，伊們終天地除了伴着牛羊羣到山上去之外，有時還要照顧牧房裏的乳牛和乳羊，晚間要看守着。自朝至暮，伊們是沒有休息的餘時。這樣，如果我們來把西康的姊妹們和瘋狂的都市中寄生家庭而抹粉搽胭脂，走電影院，上跳舞塲，一任男性們當著玩具一樣玩弄的女性來此較一下，其間相差的比數實在太巨。前者是社會生產的勞動者。後者却是一條無用的寄生蟲。</p>
<p>所以，痛痛快快地說一聲，一個是已盡了做人的責任。而一個呢？却是專事消費，毫無靈魂的。簡直已失了人形的人了！</p>
<p>伊們的服裝是因經濟地位的上下不同。普通的，多穿棉布或毛布。貴族的穿的是精細的毛布或者由印度輸入的藏片。伊們衣服的式樣是圓領，長袖，從肩而至足踝，腰部束了一條花帶，外面罩着一件外套或披肩。而，最在中國內地所保存的封建毒—束胸，在那裏是認為一種古怪的流行；因之，是絕無踪跡的。</p>
<p>每過到新年，或者佳節的時侯。是伊們最快活的時候，伊們約了許多友好，在夜裏都參入了集團的慶祝身上穿着美麗而細緻的衣服，手携手地跳着舞，唱着歌。伊們也歡迎男子們來加入伊們的集團。－直到了夜深的時候，伊們才和衣地睡了。</p>
<p>西康的婦女是光榮的，值得贊揚的。</p>
<h3>洞庭西山的婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>洞庭西山，它是　立於太湖中的一個孤島，距蘇州約九十華里水程：那兒不但風景秀麗，而且物產也很豐富。自從洪楊之役以後，山上絕少受到時局影響，即災荒匪禍，也沒有別的地方厲害，如果現在要不是為了農村破產，我想這裏眞可說是一個世外桃源呢。但那兒的教育非常落伍，風俗更極閉塞，尤其是一般婦女生活，差不多完全是停留在十八世紀的階段上。伊們給對建禮教的傳統觀念束縛着，甘心為男性們的奴隸。</p>
<p>這裏的婦女，幾乎是百分之百未受過敎育的，封建禮教的思想統制了伊們整個的行為，三從四德的閨訓支配了伊們一生的命運。「在家從母，出嫁從夫」，這是伊們千古不易的婦道，「嚴守貞操，服從丈夫」，更為每一個婦女所應明白的大義。所以亦洞庭西山，婦女死了丈夫而再醮，也要被一般人所不齒的。並目伊在再嫁的時候，上轎或舉行儀式都須擇在更深人靜以後，在無人的枯廟裏，和無主的山地上，倘若被人掃見了，或在人家的地方上了轎，那便要認為不祥，非要替人家「齋利市」，及點香燭不會干休。然而男人死了妻，却隨時　地都可以讀絃，誰都不會非議了。</p>
<p>最慘的要算望門守寡，伊們有的是童養媳，有的却運未婚夫也沒有見過面，而一旦不幸未婚失死了，居然也要度起未亡人的生活來，那我相信世界上比這種女子再可憐的是沒有了！在過去，有很多女子甘必的替自己建築一個貞婦烈女的美名，因此只要走到那裏去，就回看到許多鱗次節比的貞節牌坊，或節烈牌坊，可是現在伊們又為些什麼呢？我實在不能明白。</p>
<p>凡娶進了一個新媳婦，要布伊身上討三年「吉利，假使伊進門才後，花菓蠶桑，稻穀有一樣收得不好了，便要說伊的命生得壞，要是丈夫或公婆病了，或甚至死了，那伊就逃不了頂一個「八敗命」和「白虎星」的大罪名！</p>
<p>在鄉村中，男人偷婆娘是件光榮的事，而反之，女人和人通姦了便有七出之條約遭遇，然而丈夫遺棄了妻子，妻子除了死之外，只有去帮傭度日，却不能再嫁。所以這里的婦女因為受不了磨析而自殺，或怨憤而尋短見的很多很多，但是很少經過公平的法律處斷者，大都全是貓貓虎虎以了事的，而公婆虐待，甚至毆打媳婦差不多是很平常的事，要事媳婦偶然和公婆反抗一下時，誰都會認為是「大逆不道」的行為了。</p>
<p>雖然現代法律上已承認女子有財產繼承權，可是這裏的女子非特享受不到一些法律所賦予的權利，而且一切的經濟權也全操在男子手中的。所以，一個女人在當媳婚的一段過程裏，只是洗衣煮飯操勞不息的一個傭婦，或是一架生育兒女的機器，但結果却還不如一個傭婦的待遇，更談不到什麼代價。</p>
<p>伊們為了過度的生育和過度的疲勞，而且有了病不給調理，不為醫治的，尤其是數見不鮮，然而他們認為媳婦是脚盆水，死了一個可以再娶一個的；更其是鄉諺中有「有錢人家三年不死她婦是大不幸」，的一句話，因此那裏對於媳婦是非常的看不起的。</p>
<p>最近幾年來，因為由於農村破產的影響，伊們為了生活所追，便也走上了到都市裏來帮傭的一條路。所以，近來在上海，蘇州，湖州等處，很容易遇到幾個洞庭西山的婦女的，這真是一個不很好的現象！</p>
<p>到現在全山已有十個縣立的初級小學校，及一個私立的高級小學和四處初級小學，女孩子也似乎已有受一點敎育的機會了，但由於傳統的遺毒，所以女孩子真正能够有機會跑進學校門者，一百人之中也不過一二而巳。</p>
<p>末了，說到婚姻，男女均很少自主權，仍舊是媒妁之言，父母之命這麽一套買賣式的行為。</p>
<p>現亦婦女解放的口號和事實，都似火花一般的怒發了，而且一切問題都已非常嚴重地昭示在我們面前，但是這澎湃奔騰的時代激流，還沒有冲盪到那些窮鄉僻壤的農村里去</p>
<p>這情形，我相信是各地的農村婦女的一個浮雕，决不止於洞庭西山一隅是如此吧！</p>
<h3>執箕帚掃除惡習</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>縫紉婦</h3>
<p>— 綺鳳</p>
<p>街頭女職業者之一</p>
<p>縫劉婦在都市，雖是一種低賤的職業，但在無產階級裏却常發見其普遍的存在，不過這裏所說的縫紉婦，和</p>
<p>一般所謂女裁縫完全二樣：女裁縫是被僱入雇主家工作的，其待遇除應得工資外，尚有謄餐的供給，所以女裁縫的生活是和縫紉婦完全相反的。縫紉婦非特無膳的供給而所得工資也少得可憐。伊們並不是有工可做，有時侯，簡直</p>
<p>一全天沒有工做；這使伊們不得不另找出路以求生活，（所謂另找出路也者，明瞭如讀者當能體味之。）因此伊們被人們目為低賤的女人，低賤的職業的。</p>
<p>這種縫紉婦根據一般的考察，操此業者大都是江北的婦女，伊們之所以拋棄故鄉不憚辛苦跑到繁華的都市來幹這生活，原有不得巳的苦衷。蓋不景氣的年頭使農村經濟破產，為着生活的維持，一般壯男就脫離農村走入大都市去謀生，然其一日所得，仍不敷家庭的負担；於是那些中年的婦女就不得不也流浪到都市去加入共同奮鬥。由於智識和技術的限制，除拾荒和小販外，縫紉便是其一種職業的分野？以應一般異鄉流寓期內孤獨的無產勞動者的衣服修補的需要。</p>
<p>當然，伊們的生活，不消說是很清苦的。每天從貧民窟裏出來，向街頭流浪，一戶挨一戶的求需要者的僱用。伊們的生活費便在這斷片的勞動裏搜掘。無疑地，僅僅能支持其不能忍受的飢俄，其痛苦就可想而知了。</p>
<p>總之，伊們是較那般在社會上無能生產的蠹虫，要好上萬倍，我們應當同情和歌頌伊們的！</p>
<p>本報特寫</p>
<h3>鮑亞暉女士訪問記</h3>
<p>— 萍</p>
<p>深秋某一天晚上，記者雜在國泰戲院散塲的觀衆裏，擁出了大門，腦子有些脹。驀地掠過一個念頭，女畫家鮑亞暉的寓所，不是就在左山？伺不順道去訪問一下，主意旣定，於光踏着輕鬆的步調，向目的地進發了。找到了大門，按下電鈴，一位司閽模樣的男人，導入會客室坐下。</p>
<p>不一會，鮑女十推門而來了，身旁隨着一個瘦長穿學生裝的青年，介紹之後，才知就是她的令姪潘貫君，他她新進書家，最近以專寫漢魏馳石大江南北的，我也久聞其令，不料無意間遇着。寒喧了一會，我們便圍着圓桌，開始談話。</p>
<p>「序倫先生也在家麽？今天很想和腎伉儷談話家庭經濟學之類，因為潘先生是會計師，想來對這問題有明確的指示，給一般大小家庭做參考的」。</p>
<p>「對不起！他今晚有宴會，已經走出了，談起家庭經濟，的確很重要，可惜我毫無心　，不只妄發議論，辱承下間，可否另找題材？」</p>
<p>「那末請女士自山發表意見吧。」</p>
<p>她笑了笑。顯得很謙虛的樣子：「我一時想不起有什麼話來，所懂得一些的，是繪書而巳。」</p>
<p>這也很好，女士是畫家，就請報告學書成功的經過」</p>
<p>「我於繪畫，可以說有興趣，至於天才和功力，什麽都談不上，更何論成功。不過家母對畫是有相當成功的我自幼卽受其薰陶，漸漸發生興趣，記得在故鄉受中學敎育的時候，校裏每週有幾點鐘圖畫課，那時興致眞好胆子也大，見了什麽，便描畫什麽，並且開始摹臨山水。有一次舉行成績展覽會，選取我臨的巨幅王麓台丹樓春曉圖，掛在正中？人受觀者注目，縣長和視學也來參觀，問知是我的作品，特地對我嘉獎一番，許為可造。我那弱小的心花，可真得意極了，從此愈加奮勉，但是內地缺少師友指導和切磋，來滬後從陸鐵失先生處請益了多年，並遨游各處名山大川，名家作品，也欣賞了不少，閱歷方面，略為開拓，但囿終天才，不能有長足的進緩。</p>
<p>「一個畫家，需要時常接近山水的，閱歷愈多，氣魄愈人，桂林，雁蕩，黃山……等處，女士都去過了吧？」</p>
<p>一慚愧得很！桂林很想去，至今沒有機會，以前曾到過泰山，長城，衝山，東西天目，雁蕩也去過，可惜恰遇大雨，躲在寺院裏，兩大沒有出遊，連平生最懷念的　襪湫，都未曾看到，真是恨事！聽人家說起，黃山實在太好了，可是山勢陡險，腰足不濟的我，簡直不敢妄想。山水畫有一種皺筆法，所謂披蔴皺，斧劈皺，我先是不懂，後來看到許多黃山影片，觀察山石的石紋，果然和畫法一樣。</p>
<p>至此，這位育年畫家發言了：「平心而論；黃山松石之奇，眞使人迷戀，雲貴吾不知，至於中原的名山，當然以此為最。聽說華山也是如此，可是沒有去過，不過黃山也可說有相當缺點的，就是缺少瀑布，九龍瀑是唯一的了，然而和雁蕩大瀧湫相較，那是小巫見大巫的」。</p>
<p>記者呷了一口茶，轉眼望見右壁掛着一幅黃石谷山水，觸動話機：「嘗聞人家說起，中國繪畫極盛於清，而分門別戶，派別繁多，諸多畫家，究推何者足稱清畫的代表」？</p>
<p>鮑女士略一遲疑，接說：「這很難說，就大體言，自然數着四王，（王時敏，王鑑，王　，王麓台）四王中尤其以石谷造詣最深，我們知道，中國的山水畫分南北宗，南宗自主右承開派，北宗自李思訓開派，雖不以地形為之界畫，而自大相逕庭。自明朝唐子畏法北而摻南，大家都以為南北將滙合起來了，其實這個　功，無疑是石谷隻手造成的。至於烟客（王時敏）元照（十鑑），刻意摹倣查光（董其昌），香光自然是南奈傑出人物，二人生同時，所以和香光極近，麓台筆熟不媚，生血不澀，深得黃子久神髓，大不易得」。</p>
<p>這時潘君在旁頻頻點首，因問：「潘先生對令叔母高論以為何如」？</p>
<p>他把捲烟猛吸一口，一陣烟條隨着微笑滾出「極是！極是！不過我以為吳漁山（吳歷）出人南北，魄力雄偉，雖當時名聲不及石谷等輩，這他另有原因的。大概漁山有點名士氣，傲慢成性，不肯巴結主子，所以年垂老邁，依然落魄江湖，大有不求聞達之概。不說別的，我們在傳本裏見到他的畫就很少，論共作品，也可推為代表的大家的」。</p>
<p>話越談越長，而興致越說越濃，連忙把話匣鎖住，握手道別。</p>
<h3>亞暉女士</h3>
<h3>晚宴</h3>
<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>我曾經赴過一次晚宴，它所給予給我們的印象至今還不曾消滅，或許永遠不會消滅了！在一個初秋的星期日，我接到了一位自小在一起長大的同學的請柬約我上最新開張的新綠大館店去晚宴；晚宴原是很尋常的事情，可是那一天我因為久未和這位同學來往，不免稍覺突元，便先打一個電話到大新銀行去，本意只想問一問他們李行長公館的電話號碼，不料那接綫生竟出乎意外的告訴我李行長此刻正在行裏，於是我就和李瑞甫直接接談了。我一開口不免就問他何以星期日還在行裏，他說很忙；我說既然很忙，何必又要請客，他說不是請客，只是約幾位老朋友談談；我又問還有誰，他說大概趙樹夫婦也到的。說完，便把話筒掛了，我想這位行長先生未免太托大了，人家打了電話給他，他連「晚上一定要請到」的話都不說一句。可是我也不願跟他鬥氣，而且我有着特別的理由很想見見趙樹的夫人；當晚便凖時到了新飯店，一問主人還沒有到，但侍者說，李行長一定下下了一間房間了，便把我先招待進去，我瞧桌上已鋪着四副餐具，心想果然是老友小酌，不是大宴會，便揀個位置坐了。不料這一坐下去，一直坐到八點半鐘還不見李瑞甫和趙樹夫婦前來我當然覺得很奇怪，正想走回去，那侍者又說李行長早上來定座的時候已付過十塊錢，還說他如其不來，就請客人獨酌。其時我委實覺得很餓了，便對着那三張沒有人的椅子，獨自坐在那空房間裏吃了一客精的晚具。</p>
<p>回去之後，心上便像掛了一隻絕大的悶葫蘆，猜不透李瑞甫弄的是什麼把戲，第二天早上不料就在各報的本埠新聞上見到了一條驚人的惡耗，它的標題是「大新銀行行長李瑞甫駕車落浦，」大略說昨天晚上七時左右李瑞甫駕着自備汽車，行經楊樹浦某某碼頭附近，不愼翻車，落下了黃浦江，車中尙有大新銀行的滙劃科科長趙樹夫婦，三人同遭滅頂，屍身也不曾撈到。我最初自然很哀悼，但後來仔細一想，却又覺萬分詫異，因為李瑞甫和趙樹的家分明都在滬西海格路附近，而大新銀行的行址也在漢口路，他們根本沒有到楊樹浦去需要，而且七時左右，正是李瑞甫所約的晚宴時候，他為什麼不到西藏路新綠大飯店來而要上楊樹浦去呢？正是太奇怪了！</p>
<p>這天中午忽然又有一封李瑞甫所發的掛號信寄到我家晨來了；死人怎麼還會發信，我忙着一瞧郵戳，原來是昨天發的。急拆開看時，果然就是他的絕命書，他說他約我吃飯，本來不一定要我去，只要我知道他有這會事，所以他在電話裏不曾再用力邀我，而且當我打電話給他時，他正在寫這封信給我。他告訴我深悔在學校裏一時輕狂，和鄒嫻＋趙樹的夫人——發生了戀愛，而且還發生了肉本關係，但他自己是已有妻子的了，沒法便竭力介紹給了趙樹，並且在他們婚後還不惜費了九牛二虎之力，把趙樹薦入大新銀行，担任滙劃科科長，不料趙樹漸漸知道了他妻子和李瑞甫的關係，態度便非常跋扈，三年之內，虧空了好幾次，都强逼李瑞甫給他彌補。最近，他又投機失敗，竟一下子拆了二十萬以上的爛汚，李瑞甫一方面担心要給董事會起訴，一方面又給趙趙樹天天逼着要他破產代償。他自覺在過去中，已很對不起他的妻子和兒女了，所以决心保持他的家產，不惜挾着趙樹夫婦一同葬身魚腹。</p>
<p>現在事情已隔兩年了，我遵着他的囑咐，勉力給他照料着一家，然而他的妻子兒女至今都還不曾知道他是自殺的咧！</p>

<p>數千年來學之懸案</p>
<h3>肺癆治療困難問題　已開闢一無上的新路</h3>
<p>— Dr.Scott　M.D.著沈兆荃譯</p>
<p>從前用化學藥品殺滅肺菌是無根據的空想！　現今萬國通過之臟器療法確有根據合理有效！</p>
<p>現代醫學對於肺癆一症。老早便高揭了那『無藥可投』的標語。這也無怪乎。因為届至今日所謂新發明的無數藥品。試問結果。那個不是使病人失望？</p>
<p>對於肺癆病的藥物療法。為什麽不生著效？此種問題。有種種之理由。因為肺癆病的病原物。是結核菌，癆茵，且患部位居深處的肺臟裏面。結核菌有極强之抵抗力。不論內服藥或注射藥。都不能直接的到肺裏面去撲滅牠。</p>
<p>肺癆病施用藥劑療法。每易發生危險：其理由。因為有些化學藥品。雖然在試騐管裏面有殺滅結核菌的能力。但性極猛烈有毒。况人乃活跳的生物。並非鐵石所製。若以可殺結核菌的强烈藥品。施用於人體內。當然是有中毒的危險。所以。吾人在醫學上。對此種直接撲滅體內結核菌之藥劑。要於人體無害者。可說是絕未發見。</p>
<p>於一九三二年奧京維也納。開萬國結核大會。到有各國著名的肺病專家。一致通過『肺結核之臟器療法』為確有根據而最合理的療法。贓器療法是德國柏爾託爾特A.A．Berthald及英國史泰林Starlinl一博士所發明。現有一種『肺活』Phlth　Weal就是採用壯健哺乳動物的肺臟和脾臓兩種臓器組織中提出之內分泌素（又名荷爾蒙）所製。用『肺活』Phith　Weal治療肺結核症(即肺癆病)。確有偉大之靈妙的自然效力。凡曾實行此法者。莫不同聲驚嘆。自『肺活』Phith　Weal發明以後。數千年來之肺病治療困難問題。已開闢一無上的新路。完全根本解决。即在今日身受其賜者。亦不可勝數。</p>
<p>臟器製劑『肺活』Phith　Weal治療肺結核之效果。能使衰萎的肺臟（卽是有病之肺）機能復活。同時而鼓舞肺細胞之活力。發揮其天然的防禦作用。强大其抵抗力。征服癆菌。並增殖結締組織。填補病灶之缺損。且於病部的周圍由此結締組識而築成堤防（形如戰爭之防禦線包圍惡魔的結核菌。禁其活動。幷使白血球而攻之令其自歸消減。患部亦因之形成硬化。結成疤痕。以至痊愈。本療法為使患者本身發揮其天然防禦機能。而包圍結核病灶待敵自滅之策。所以『肺活』對於人體。絲毫無害。對於肺病而有不可思議之效果。</p>

<h3>氣喘病根治談</h3>
<p>— 英國BAUSZKY著陸志成譯</p>
<p>氣管支哮喘者。卽支氣管狹隘。氣阻喘鳴。時發時止之呼吸困難也。本病之起始。先為易罹感冒。常發氣管炎或呼吸之不暢達等症。日久則成定型性之哮喘。倘患者放任不治。或醫之不當。遂成終身病疾，永無健康之福。且往往併發肺結核或肺氣腫。以致不克終其天年。</p>
<p>哮喘之療法。向無完美藥物。故頑固不易根治。通常於哮喘發作之時。大都施用嗎啡等麻醉劑之注射或內服。暫以緩解其苦悶。但發作時間稍長者。則無效。此因麻醉劑祗片時有效。待藥性消失。遂仍復原狀。且每發卽用者。易致中毒之虞。故不宜常用為是。必須慎重選擇良藥。以謀安全之根治。</p>
<p>茲有德國亨堡特醫學博士根據圾新學理。參合平素臨床經騐。採用哺乳動物之臓器。提出有效成分。製出氣喘病內服特效藥『哮立平』Holipin。藥內不含絲毫麻醉劑。其作用完全為天然功效。於人體絕無弊害。曾經全球醫師實騐證明。於哮喘發作時服之。約數十分鐘。遂見平復。且本病每多於夜間發作。邀請醫生順多不便。則『哮立平』Holipin之內服療法。大有利於病者。且可免注射之苦矣。據各國專家之治療報告。『哮立平』非但為急救平喘之效。並有根治氣喘之可能。若患者於間歇期連續內服二三月。結果多能根治不發。而世界學者對此藥早有定評。實騐報告，已散見各國雜誌報章。無待余贅矣。</p>

<p>月經談話</p>
<h3>婦女的憂鬱！　怎麼樣使月經正順青春健美？</h3>
<p>— 柏秀貞女醫師</p>
<p>婦女病中之最普遍者為月經不調。月經痛。無月經等症。凡患此病者决非限於月經一部分之不調不整而已，必也面黃肌瘦。精神懈怠。腰痠背痛睡眠缺乏。帶下頻多。每致缺少生趣。而妨碍孕育。甚則陷於乾血癆瘵之地步。貴屬至可悲觀之病也。蓋月經之不調。並非瘀血有所凝阻。而為女性生殖機能發生障碍之表現。此機能一有障碍。則全身內分泌腺體。亦同時發生障碍。於是全身之組織。為之衰退。血液亦漸形枯槁。而容貌遽變灰暗憔悴致天然之健美豐韻不予稍留。而病乃限於困苦矣。</p>
<p>按著者臨床經驗。近有『美奴奪』Monorrin一藥。即依據女性病理之需要以發明。凡我女同胞患有月經不調緒症者。如能按法服用。能得經水調順。百病消除。恢復健康。他如無病之少女常服。可使軀體愈加健康。容貌益形丰韻。婦人常服。益嗣强身。青春永駐。是誠婦女保健防癆。補血調經之良藥也。</p>

<h3>色為少年第一關</h3>
<p>— 方視同醫師</p>
<p>孔子曰：『少年血氣未定。戒之在色』蓋男女當春情發動期。性慾興奮。最能影響於肉體精神。德之社會學者名之曰：『為人生最危險之時期。』凡淫慾無度者。則精髓枯　。腎部虧損。斷傷眞元。以致身弱多病。大都青年之肺癆。均起於好色兒也。</p>
<p>每見青年子弟。年方髫稚。情竇初開。或偷看淫書小說。或同淡定戲語褻穢。因而妄生慾火。往往藉手淫而暗洩至寶。或逍遙於花柳塲中。亂淫無度。或於夜間夢洩遺精。皆足以消耗精力。損傷元氣。於是。漸漸肢體羸弱。飲食减少。腰痛腿軟。頭暈。目眩。憂鬱。頭痛。健忘。失眠。致神經衰弱各症疊現。為父母者警惶憂懼。不知所措。或以為先天不足。或以為風寒所感。或以為補養失宜。實則皆自作之孽也。</p>
<p>先哲有言：『色為少年第一關。』此關打不過。任他高才絕學。都不能得力。蓋萬事以身為本。身乃以精為寶。故精水不竭。則耳目聰明。身心健全。如油之養燈。油不竭則燈不滅。慾火焚燒。精神易竭。遂至腎虧體衰。終成虛癆。死於非命。可不畏哉。</p>
<p>慾海無邊。回頭是岸。此少年所當猛省者也，</p>
<h3>身體上之衛生</h3>
<p>春情發動期之性慾極易衝動。尤易誤犯手滿腔熱情惡。</p>
<p>故宜避去刺激性之興奮。切忌飲酒。因酒能引起性慾。青年須連避之。</p>
<p>平日宜注意心身之修養。改除一切不良習慣。行正當之衛生。常至野外散步。行有益之運動。避免身心過勞。如身體衰弱者。多攝限滋養食品。</p>
<p>據衛生學大家斯託爾博士謂：犯手淫惡癖而難於戒絕之人。皆為先天性神經質者。因意志薄弱。不能自制此動行為。故宜施用神經强壯劑『未美爾補腦法』Memory　Neurotic滋養其腦力。健全其身心。而意志得以堅强。可自尅制手滿腔熱情惡癖。此劑曾用以試騐多人。均有美滿之成績。且皆呈年富力强之气概云。</p>
<h3>健腦强身</h3>
<p>神經衰弱。為手淫及房事過度者必發之症。例如頭重·頭痛·暈眩·健忘·失眠·盜汗·心悸·記憶力减退。全身疲勞。腰背竣痛·作事無恒·皮膚蒼白·身體贏瘦·精神抑鬱·夜間夢洩遺精等。紼屬於神經衰弱之病狀。</p>
<p>本症之療法。以神經强壯劑之『米美爾補腦法』Memory　Neurotic最有特效。用後可使腦力健金。身體强壯。精力充足。誠强壯劑中之佳品也。但修養與衛生。仍須同時注重。</p>
<h3>挽救衰老</h3>
<p>早婚縱慾。手淫斵傷。俱能耗損元陽。欲挽救虛弱各症。當用强精補腎劑之『還爾童』效力靈騐。且無流弊。因本品係取雄壯動物之睾丸精製成。患者服用後。能促進生殖器之生理機能。製造精液之作用旺盛。恢復全身活力。元氣充足。精力倍增。如早共用衰老者用之。可挽回青春之健旺。有返老還童之概。現今各國醫師莫不推獎『還爾童』WellTonic為世界惟一之天然補劑。較市間普通司保命與其他同類製劑之效力。超大數倍。其價値可知。</p>
<h3>落伍的青年　怎麼樣可以打開一條光明之路？</h3>
<p>— 章元楨</p>
<p>在學生時代的青年，他們對於頭腦明晰法和記憶力堅强法的渴望，好比飢民的求食；這是像老人的探求不老長壽法—和返老還童法同一心理。</p>
<p>在青春時代，生理上因生殖器之內分泌的活動，易起性的煩惱；精神上因知褒慾高每好敵讀，因此煩惱更甚。至於考試時的煩惱狀態，那是更加劇烈了！所以現在的青年學子，差不多有十之七八都感覺神經衰弱的悲哀。</p>
<p>神經衰弱—是在黑暗中毀滅青春生活的惡魔！這病能使前途有為的青年，一變而為可憐無用的殘身；人生的幸福，盡付東流，這是何等的可怕病症。</p>
<p>腦為神經系統的根源，由腦部發出的神經織維，好比如樹枝一樣，散佈到全身各組織各器官，吾人一切之動作，都要由腦頒發命令—由神經作為傳導—而營其全體生存上的生活現象。所以加爾氏說：『人類之本能，情緒，思想，天才，慾念，以及其他道德，智慧，與諸種精神現象，皆以腦為策源地』。由此觀之，腦為人身主宰—換句說話，腦就是我們的生命線。那麽，若要挽救神經的衰弱，就非補給腦部的營養不可！</p>
<p>照此說來，要想培植健全的頭腦，和驅除毀滅生命力的神經衰弱，惟有常時服用Memory　Neurotic『米美爾補腦汁』，可以使腦力健全，神經强壯，精力旺足，這樣才能得到頭腦明晰，思想靈敏，記憶堅强的效果。除了此種療補法以外，無論吃什麼被劑，是白費辛苦，毫無利益的—現在各國醫師都證明『米美爾補腦汁』有挽救衰弱——培補腦力的權威。幷經調查歐美各大醫院診療之報告，確有數千萬落伍的青年，服用此藥後，已復得健康，底於成功之境。所以譯出來給我國萎弱落伍的諸位青年同胞，打開黑暗的生活，謀得美滿的出路！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>廿九軍大演習</h3>
<p>— 汶</p>
<p>剛看過了我們「友邦」在平津兩地「空前」的大操演後的平津一帶居民，聽到的只是「友邦」的砲聲，與看到旭日的旗幟，飛揚於「文化城」內外，而此刻却幸而還能聽一聽本國的砲聲，與數千中華建兒的奔馳。說來可笑，聽聽本國砲聲，也未始不能略可解嘲，這頗類於阿Q的行徑，但在此時此地，能够作些阿Q的自慰，却也已是幸福甚了。</p>
<p>宋哲元將軍最近曾語人云：「我决不作亡國奴，决不作吳三桂，洪承疇，但也不做文天祥，史可法，而却要做郭子儀」。郭子儀一手打退回紇，安定唐朝社稷，而文天祥，史可决，名聲雖永垂後世，可是宋朝與明朝究竟是亡了。國家已亡，雖有死難忠臣，於事終屬無補的。在這一點上，宋將軍願做郭子儀而不願做文，史，意義是値得贊同的。</p>
<p>在一團烏烟瘴氣下的華北，要支持那麽一個現狀，同時事實上又不許可再進一步，宋將軍也着實爲難了。此次廿九軍大演習，母寗可說我們是沒有想到的。自然，這對於「友邦」，大概不會含有什麼敵對意義。但究是我們的土地，民衆只能見到外國兵，現在本國民衆出錢養活的中國兵，也來出現一下，無論如何，我們總不能不對於這决演習，有一種難說的感想。</p>
<p>從廿九軍的大演習，我們自然而然聯想到全國二百萬以上的軍隊，最好都能調到各處的國防前綫，都來一决大演習。人家在我們土地上演習，且明顯的以北平爲假想攻擊點，那末我們全國都來大演習，友邦無論如何總難說這又是一種有敵意的行爲罷。我們軍隊對外的陣容，國徽的光輝，民衆希望看到的心情太熱烈了。武裝同志們，我們熱烈的歡迎你們的大演習。</p>
<p>再由此而想到最近蔣委員長五十壽辰，各界購機祝壽的熱烈。這事情，固然可從多方面來說，但有一點是無論如何不能抹煞的，卽是民衆購贈飛機的熱烈，表示需要這飛機，能耀武於疆塲，由千千萬萬民衆集攏來的血汗金錢所買的飛機，唯一希望它仍要爲保護千千萬萬民衆而用。當然决不是買買攏塲面，凑熱　的。民衆怎樣希望這大批飛機能爲保衛國家而用，這却是隱在人民心底的衷誠。</p>
<p>對於國家，對於政府，人民的擁護與贊助，已熱烈到頂點了。負有保衛國家民族的責任的將何以事實的表現來酬答這千千萬萬民衆不可計量的熱情呢？</p>
<h3>自來水將增價</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>據大陸報載稱：公共租界工部局現正與上海自來水公司會商公司所提出修改目下水費章程建議。按本年三月間公司股東舉行常年曾議時，據總董李德立氏宣布：根據常年報吿：公司所獲盈利，非動用「積金」不敷發給「股息」，故增加水費一舉，實不可免云。近因「不得不出」此畢，乃向工部局提出此議，如經商妥，何時實行，尙未宣布。但衆料將自「下月一日」（卽十二月一日）或明年一月一日起實行。</p>
<p>這個消息如果傳至每個上海居民的耳朶中去，我想信，其恐慌情形是一定會比電話增價那時來得厲害的。電話我們小民可以不裝，不管事！卽使裝者，除非商店商號，是出於萬不得已的外，住戶之裝電話者，究竟是上海八十萬住民中之　有者了。然而自來水，却是每</p>

<p>靈樞素問</p>
<p>— 劉馨柏醫師主答</p>
<p>身體太胖</p>
<p>第八十八號，大夏大學槐沈生君問：（一）身體太肥；雖則時作室內運動，仍不見削瘦？（二）怎樣節育？（三）看書時過久時覺頭痛，記憶力薄，吃艾羅補腦汁有效嗎？（四）魚肝油是不是喫了使人更肥？、</p>
<p>答：（一）一個人身體的胖瘦是山人身內脂肪存集的多少而定的，所以打算削瘦，就須除去人身內的脂肪。减少脂肪呌做脫脂療法。而人一天所喫的東西到人身體以內，差不多樣樣有變成肪的可能性。所以要削瘦祗有减食和增加運動。前者可以减少脂肪的生產，後者可增加脂肪的消費。在榮養學上計算脂肪的產銷，以「卡維里」為單位，和物理學上計算熱力一樣。每人每日維持營養所用的「卡羅里』量雖因人而異，大抵在五千至七千之間。所以計算了每日輸人體內的卡雜里，如减少至消費量以下，人身內的脂肪就漸漸减少，這就是說，人會慢慢瘦下去。關於這一點，沈君可以買一本有食物卡羅里槪算表的書，自己飲食就照這本書計算着去喫。（二）不在答覆範圍之內，恕不答。（三）神經衰弱，請注射「補爾神」（Blusen）。（四）是。能使人發胖。</p>
<p>過勞頭痛</p>
<p>第八十九號，楊樹浦廣信路一九七〇號，上海紗廠工銀課周國華君問：敝人身體素弱，稍受勞動或遲睡時，立卽發生頭痛。痛時方位不一，請問何藥可能治癒？</p>
<p>答：服「痛必靈」（Tpmbelin），每次兩片，不過跡近對症治療。君頭痛是由身心過勞而來，以注射「賀爾賜保命」（Hormspermin）爲宜。</p>
<p>經痛不育</p>
<p>第九十號，愛文義路福日邨十六號，陳民君間。月經來時腰痛，腹痛，腿痛，精神倦怠，思睡，易發怒，飯量减少。經後翌日交姤仍有紅潮，不育，平時有白帶，性交後精液卽漸流出。請問（一）月經痛苦是何病，（二）何藥醫？（三）經後交姤仍有紅潮是否能成終身病？（四）怎樣能生育？（五）白帶何藥醫？（六）性交後精液流出是吾不姙之原因？</p>
<p>答：（一）此名『月經困難』。（二）月經來潮之前一日，一日三次，每次用一調羹之當歸兒』（Tancnol），與二片之「痛必靈』（Tonbelin），同時服下，連續服至月經後爲止。月經瘉苦可全消失。（三）此爲習見之現象，不足爲病，服前藥亦能治癒。但月經後之翌日交姤殊不宜，再遲一二日最適當。（四）不姙之原因甚多，不診查出其原因，不能下一定論。不姙不能全歸咎於爲妻者，丈夫亦有責任·（五）服『新亞鈣劑（Slinocalcin）。（六）健康之交姤精液只有一小部分留陰道內，大部分排出；故君此現象，是生理現象，不是病理現象，也不是不育的原因。</p>
<p>腎炎和結婚</p>
<p>第九十一號，牯嶺路毓麟里二十六號李修士君問：我今年廿歲，男性未婚。九年前曾患急性腎炎，但沒有等到全癒就出了醫院，至今每次檢騐小便皆含有微量之蛋白質，有時且含有少許之紅血球。寒天如頻飲多量之開水，則一小時之內小便可三四次，每次有四五百公撮之多。現在身體衰弱，間有『尿酸性之腿痛』（？）。雖然做事行動一如常人，但罹有慢性腎炎則須明確。問（一）能否結婚？（二）如結婚後有何害處？</p>
<p>答：（一）可。（二）無害。但君旣自知有此病，何不卽早醫好之？</p>
<p>尿中球菌</p>
<p>第九十二號，城內侯家路吳家弄三十九號周堅君問。。敝人前曾犯淋病，今已醫愈。近日往衛生局騐尿，檢得有璉球菌（編者按：大槪是鍊鎖狀球菌）發現，但無雙球菌找着。故請解答以下問題：（一）犯璉球菌自療以何藥醫治，請介紹！（二）每日早晨有白汁封口，是否攝護腺漏，以何藥醫治之，（三）犯璉球菌可否行房？</p>
<p>答：（一）鏈鎖狀球菌發現於尿中有膀胱炎之可疑，宜請醫珍斷後服『淸濁便』（Citropin）及「　華葉素（Uvarsol）·（二）此非攝護腺炎之症狀，而是慢性淋病之症狀。慢性淋病尿中雙球菌甚少，往往百檢不得。在此塲中，應先注射百淋恐（Polygon淋病球菌苗漿）二千五百萬一針，重新檢尿·（三）不可。</p>
<p>是否梅毒</p>
<p>第九十三號，張堪然君問：敝人偶涉花叢，沾染淋毒，現已二月餘，大體痊愈，但在一月前陰莖包皮內生一潰瘍，初以爲是因淋病關係，未會注意，後來兩腿彎處有兩硬塊，乃疑及橫痃，但不痛，亦不大不小。現在骨節酸痛，喉痛。（一）不知是否梅毒？（二）淋病是否能變梅毒？（三）怎樣能知確實？（四）如何治法注射六〇六抑他種針藥。</p>
<p>答：（一）是。（二）不是淋病變梅毒，是兩病同時傅染，但淋病度潛伏期短，故先發作，梅毒潛伏期長，故至一月時始變作也。（三）驗血。（四）注射六〇六及「尅爾梅星」（Carbisin）。前者每星期一針，後者每三日一針。</p>
<p>兩脚濕爛</p>
<p>第九十四號，法租界望志路南永吉里四十五號，鄭定漢軍問：敵人自十歲時爛脚，現在已是二十歲了，在這十年中，雖經十次的醫療，都不見效。起初是從脚的小部分，因爲奇瘡不得不抓爬，以致破潰。現在兩脚都潰瀾不堪，　痕疊疊，血水幷流。我想這是父母花柳的遺傳吧？因我從未尋花問柳：（一）是否花柳毒？（二）父母是否須赴醫院騐血？（三有意義該打何種針？（四）內服外搽何藥</p>
<p>答：（一）騐血後始知？（二）無須。（三）騐血陽性者注射「阿斯凡納命」，（Aaphenamin）陰性者注射「癢苦樂」（Jukulol）。（四）不用內服藥，外搽「皮治樂軟膏」（Pixrol　Ointment）。</p>
<p>記憶不良</p>
<p>第九十五號，王義新君問：敝人現尚在中學讀書，不幸受別人誘惑而手淫，後見先生之說手淫之害，立卽戒絕，但茲後性慾非常亢進，偶見一女性，心中卽起色情的空想。而心跳，記憶不良，幻想，多疑，好怒，看書也不知是看的什麽東西，心很難放在書上。滑精也是常有的事。到最近，更知道自己是有早洩病的。我狠憂愁，這種病不治好，不是把父母約期望，自己的前途都毀滅了嗎？請先生救救我吧！（一）是性神經衰弱不是？（二）滑精怎樣治？（三）早洩是否不能結婚？（四）性神經衰弱怎樣根治？（五）早洩能否痊愈，怎樣治？</p>
<p>答：（一）是。（二）服「補美斯」（Bromagsin）。（三）非絕對不能結婚，但難圖家庭幸福，圓滿，並搆成離婚理由。（四）注射」補爾神」（Blu）。（五）能，注射「保利多命（Polytonin）。甫交</p>
<p>甫交卽洩</p>
<p>第九十六號，南市尚文路一六號，楊永康君問：鄙大體質素弱，去秋結婚後，更日益瘦弱，見色漏精，甫交卽洩，胃呆，失眼等症。敬問先生此等病狀：（一）是否早婚所致，抑或體弱所致？（二）其發展前途如何？（三）妻子不育於敝人有無關係？關係何在？（四）如何治療？服藥或診治？（五）何藥最靈效，何處醫師最妙手？請介紹。（六）如何注意攝生？</p>
<p>答：（一）早婚，房事過度，未婚前手淫均能致此。（二）不加意療治，永遠無恢復快樂之日。（三）有關，但未必全山此而來，欲得詳細診斷，須診斷雙方。（四）見（五）（六）。（五）服Bromagsin補美心）注射「保利多命」（Polytonin），能請醫診治後再定治療當然更有效。但何處醫師最「妙手」，限於衛生處之條例，不能介紹。（六）禁慾，最小限度三個月。行冷水浴，服補藥：「星牌精製魚肝油」（Cod　Liver　Oli）Star　Brand）。「利凡命」（Livemin）。</p>
<p>咳嗽肺病</p>
<p>第九十七號，黃芝齡君問：敝人年三十歲，自昔卽時患咳嗽，吐濃痰，但人體尚佳。自今年三月起，人日瘦一日，痰中帶有血絲，咳嗽時胸內隱隱作痛。近來更不如前，竟夜間盜汗，下午發熱。恐是肺病，故敢來信請問先生：（一）是否肺病？（二）不治有危險舌？（三）應服何藥，注射何藥？（四）盜汗之治法，發熱之治法？（五）咳嗽用何藥可止？（六）擬來前請先生診查，先生之門診時刻？</p>
<p>答：（一）是。（二）應速療治。（三）服「星牌精製魚肝油」，（Cod　live　Oil）靈」）（Sinocholin）。（四）盜汗服LupulinCamphormonobromide，發熱服「熱禍辟盡」（Neopyretin五）「咳利舒開」（Kresocal）。（六）上午九一二，下午三—五。星期下午休息。</p>
<p>個上海住民的無時無刻而不可缺少的日常需用品之一，如今要增價了，這是無形中加重我們小民本來吃重的肩仔上的負擔了。　上海的弄堂房子，大多數可以說是被「大貧」所居住的，一上一下一幢的單幢房子，搭了擱樓，再把天井也攔出，又把露台也搭成房間，住上六七家人家的，是很普通很而又普遍的。我們也可以從一上一下這單幢房子里，每天可以找出很瑣碎的口角或甚至是相駡相打的小事，表現在所謂「二房東」和「三房客」之間的。而其口角或甚至相駡相打之起因，大半是爲了「三房客」電燈「太」多點了，或則是把「自來水」「太」浪用了。這些瑣碎的小事的爭執，或許會給電燈公司或是自來水公司的股東老爺們聽來會笑破肚皮的吧？然而在我們大貧者們看來，却是認爲問題嚴重而一點也不可笑謔的事情啊！</p>
<p>現在上海自來水公司要增加自來水的理由，據該公司總董李德立氏所官布，根據常年報告，公司所獲「盈利」，非動用「公積金」，不敷發給「股息」，所以增加水費一舉，實在不可避免了。然而我們要向自來水公司的股東老爺們說：現在正是世界鬧着很兇的經濟恐慌，並且楚「每况愈下」，你們的賺錢當然不可比之於經濟旺盛的那時候了。又何况「公積金」還是我們大貧者們的汗血所積成的呢！爲了不敷發給你們的「股息」，你們却不顧到我們小民們的生計艱難，因此增加水費一舉，實不可免，這在常情看來，的確有點太「自私了。我們是一點也不敢贊同你們的增加加水費！</p>
<h3>薺菜</h3>
<p>— 廖楚咻</p>
<p>薺菜，周作人先生在「故鄉的野菜」中，有過下邊一節叙述：「…薺菜是浙東人春天常吃的野菜。鄕間不必說，就是城裏，只要有後園的入家，都可以隨時采食。婦女小兒，各拿一把剪刀，一只「苗籃」，蹲在地上搜尋，是一種有趣味的游戲工作。那時，小孩們唱道：「薺菜馬蘭頭，姊姊嫁在後門頭」。後來馬蘭頭，有鄉人拿進城售賣了，但薺菜還是一種野菜，須得自家去采」。</p>
<p>我們家鄉的人比浙東窮，凡是什麽可以賣錢的東西，都搜尋出來賣錢。所以，薺菜也頗有人拿着上街售賣了。</p>
<p>薺菜眞是隨地都生的野菜。像我們家裏，有一個小小的後園，就取之不需了。春天，下午實在漫長得有點怕人，於是母親就帶着我們，到後園中閒眺。一方面呌小丫頭「挑」薺菜。采薺菜，我們鄕下和浙東一樣呌做「挑」的。不過，不用剪刀，而用掘喂羊的草的特製的三角形的小刀罷了。挑好了不一定就吃，擱着往往黃了不能吃，拋掉了。然而母親總是一天隔一天的要小丫頭「挑」着，完全當作一種消遣了。</p>
<p>慕春，薺菜開着花，我就天天跑到後園去採。同時口裏唱着聽來的不完全的兒歌：</p>
<p>「薺菜花開來一層一層像珍珠塔，油菜花開來賽黃金—」</p>
<p>干是一個下午，就在這歌聲中過去了。</p>
<p>江吳鈕琇觚賸「早草」云；「歲歉豐，甘草先生，」甘草卽薺菜。劉伯溫早春詞：「喜見兒童相報，牆邊薺菜先生」。不知確吾？但是薺菜生得很早，早春時，因爲嫩也，格外可口。新年的菜肴中，薺菜總是一隻時新菜。</p>
<p>顧祿淸嘉飲，三月野菜花云：「薺菜花，俗呼野菜花，因爲諺有三月三，螞蟻上竈山之語。三日，入家皆以菜花置竈陘上，以壓虫蟻。邨童呌賣不絕，或婦女簪髻上，以祈淸目，俗號眼亮花，或以隔年糕油煎食之，云能明目，謂之眼亮糕」。蘇東坡物類相感志總論亦云：「三月三日，收薺菜花，置燈檠上，則飛蛾蚊虫不投」這自然不確的。就是吳人現在於三月三日把薺菜花放在竈上，也不過因爲歷來如此做的罷了了。</p>
<p>由汝成西湖游覽志：「三月三日，男女皆戴薺菜花。諺云：「三春戴薺菜，桃李羞繁華」。吳曼雲江鄉節物詞小序：「杭俗，上已日，置薺菜花於竈上，以驅蟲蟻。詩云「一枝春向竈觚採」。杭與蘇，相去不遠，風俗自有相同者，不過杭地因爲二句諺語，而格外把薺菜弄得艷麗了。</p>
<p>淸嘉錄上載吳入把薺菜炒隔年糕吃，周作人先生也說：「但浙東却不很理會這些事情，只是挑來做菜或炒年糕吃罷了。」薺菜本身就很有鮮味的，又因爲是「野菜」，所以，總以素食爲主。炒肉炒鷄，雖則也很好，但總覺得不相宜。而在上海，大槪只有炒肉炒鷄吃了罷</p>
<p>不跟着母親，觀挑薺菜已經十年了。就是「珍珠塔」一樣的薺菜花也四五年沒有看到了。故鄉格外窮了，人們吃野生的薺菜的時候，自然更多。不知道我家的後園，近年來薺菜是否還和從前一樣多？假使「歲歉豐，甘草先生的話正確，那末也一定很少了。只有二句聽來的不完全的兒歌直　現在還沒有忘掉：</p>
<p>「薺菜花開來一層一層像珍珠塔，油菜花開來賽黃金」！</p>
<h3>鄉居</h3>
<p>— 璜</p>
<p>池塘里的瓜棚</p>
<p>我到郊外閒步去。</p>
<p>郊外的風景看來似乎依然，只是茅屋里的烟變得淡薄而乏力，回憶中的池塘，在靜寂的秋天的陽光下，起了銀色的漣漪，鴨子們在自在地浮游着。</p>
<p>池塘里有一架瓜棚，旁邊蔓着細長的絲瓜，嫩黃的花兒像他們的主人一樣，張開着餓瘦了的嘴巴。二三條缺乏營養的絲瓜低垂下來，下面有糞筐承看。糞箕，你這齷齪的東西，正是新生者的搖籃喲！</p>
<p>路畔的血痕</p>
<p>一陣尖銳的槍聲把我從夢里震醒過來、，我慌忙爬下床，就看見弟弟的哀惻的臉龐，他渾身抖動着，說話紆緩而無力。</p>
<p>——哥哥，後門外打死了三個人。後門外是公路，這時候剛傳來一陣陣嘈雜的人聲，其中混着幾個女入的沙嘎的哭喊。</p>
<p>——我的兒呀……</p>
<p>——你死得好苦呀……</p>
<p>我呆呆地坐在床沿，邊聽着那凄切的喊聲，邊幻想着飛淺在路畔，在靑草地上的血痕。我隱約看見一個年靑的女人抱着一個男屍在痛哭，也許是她的父親，也許是她的丈夫！也許是她的弟弟。</p>
<p>一串眼淚從我的眼眶裏淌了下來。</p>
<p>在我的幻覺里，紫色的血漸漸的，漸漸的擴大開來，一直佔有了我眼前一切的空間，漸漸地向我迫近過來。</p>
<p>直到我淸醒過來，外面的哭聲漸去漸遠了，我慌忙走近牆邊，站在桌子上，打開後面的窗。外面沙地正染着幾張殷紅的血跡，死屍不見了，但踩着血跡的脚跡却向遠處伸展過去。</p>
<p>——死者，你安息吧——有人已踏過你的血跡走向前面去了！</p>
<p>海</p>
<p>故鄉是臨海的。記得是在小孩的時候，我們曾牽着同伴們的手，踏着細沙，在海邊遊要着、。我們檢着貝殼，挖着沙坑。倦了的時候，便呆然的坐着，望着面前那無邊的海。那時候海像我們的母親，她撫着我們。</p>
<p>然而我現在回故鄕來了，看不見愛我的母親，海也失了她柔和的母性了。</p>
<p>我獨自走到海邊，在黃昏的時候，遠處的連山接着暮靄，滿潮的海像一個憤怒的暴君。她翻騰着，動着咆哮着</p>
<p>在暮色之下，海的怒姿是雄渾的，而又可怕的，她像一個剛脫下鏈扣的人，她反叛了。</p>
<p>愛的故鄕，親切的海，只留在記憶里了。是什麽改變了他們？是什麼改變了他們呢？</p>
<p>我望着海，她沒有回答我，却報我以咆哮而且不斷地翻騰着。</p>

<h3>Spying on Pingdiquan and Datong by the Puppet Bandit Army of Chahar Northern Territory; Bombing by Certain Planes; Military Focus Shifting to Bailingmiao; Small Groups of Scattered Bandits Harassing Xingtao</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a dispatch from Sui, the puppet bandit army in Shangdu has shifted its target, spying on Pingdiquan and Datong, planning to launch a general offensive on northern Sui after the puppet army in the rear is concentrated. Meanwhile, only small groups of puppet bandits have clashed with our army in Taolin, Xinghe, and other places in eastern Sui, harassing us from time to time to contain our forces. This morning, four planes came to Xinghe, Taolin, and Zhuozishan to reconnoiter. The residents of these areas have already evacuated. Fu Zuoyi is now going to Pingdiquan to inspect the defenses and will address the garrison troops before returning to Suiyuan in the afternoon. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The military focus of the puppet bandit army in northern Chahar has shifted to Bailingmiao. The total number of troops gathered at the temple is only over 20,000. It is decided that after the elite troops of Rehe and most of their forces arrive at the temple, a full-scale offensive against Suiyuan will be launched around the 20th. At the moment, some party is recruiting workers in Shangdu to build aircraft and gasoline storage depots. The puppet bandits' attack on Suiyuan on the 11th and 12th was purely for the purpose of creating chaos. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) The newly appointed Commander of the Eastern Sui Security Forces, Dong Qiwu, held an inauguration ceremony in Pingdiquan on the 13th. Fu Zuoyi and Zhao Chengzhou arrived in Pingdiquan from Suiyuan on the morning of the 13th to inspect. Fu returned to Suiyuan that night and will arrive on the morning of the 14th to take command in Pingdiquan. The number of puppet bandit troops arriving at Bailingmiao in recent days is less than 1,000. Li Shouxin's troops stationed at the temple have all been transferred to Shangdu. Residents in Suiyuan have been leaving one after another since the 13th. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain telegram from a private source in Zhangjiakou, three planes from some party flew to Pingdiquan this morning to reconnoiter and dropped several bombs before flying towards Shangdu. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guihua) Kang Wang held the Chugela Conference in Sui banner on the 13th. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain party in Beiping received an urgent telegram from Zhangjiakou stating that three planes from a certain party flew to Pingdiquan at around 9:00 AM this morning to reconnoiter for a long time and dropped several bombs before flying towards Shangdu. The extent of the damage is still unclear. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that the puppet bandit army of Chahar and Sui will launch a general offensive on Suiyuan on the 20th. The puppet bandit army is now attempting to seize Pingdiquan to block the connection between the Jin and Sui armies. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Shouxin's puppet army in Shangdu recently planned to harass the border of Sui with small groups of mounted bandits to threaten the garrison troops. Bailingmiao in northern Sui is still actively transporting supplies, with a completion date of sometime this month. Li Shouxin is using that as the first line of defense. Observers have already arrived in Pingdiquan. Some party had previously set up tents to garrison there, but they have recently been withdrawn. Rumors are rampant in the area. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a dispatch from Jining regarding the eastern Sui puppet army's harassment plan, the main force will be in Wuchuan and Taolin, using cavalry to attempt to bypass the rear of Guihua and Suiyuan, with the aim of reaching Bikqi and Salachi to cut off the Ping-Sui Railway and isolate Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia from Sui province. The frontal army will be infantry, with Jining as the destination, to contain our forces. Another branch will aim for Gonghe, attempting to outflank Fengzhen and cut off the Jin-Sui connection. The three routes of puppet troops will launch simultaneously, along our defense line on the Sui border from Xinghe to Wuchuan, a distance of over 200 li. The troop deployment is relatively dense. It is reported that the puppet bandits are focusing their efforts on attacking the flank of Wuchuan. Although there was a clash at noon on the 11th in Xinghe and Taolin, it was only a skirmish. The main battle has not yet been launched. Wang Jingma, Commander of the Overseas Third Military Region, flew from Chengde to Shangdu on the 11th to set up a general headquarters. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Kwantung Army and North China Army Headquarters are still adhering to the Tianjin Conference resolution from early October regarding the Eastern Sui incident, which is within the responsibility of the Kwantung Army Headquarters and has nothing to do with the Hebei-Chahar political situation. The Japanese Army Headquarters in Tianjin has informally expressed this to the Hebei-Chahar authorities. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Zhangjiakou, grains, rice, flour, leather goods, kerosene, and various daily necessities have all been bought up by some party and transported to Jiabus, Bailingmiao, and other areas day and night using over 200 military vehicles, making it extremely busy. After the goods in Zhangjiakou were sold out, they went to Datong and Xuanhua to purchase, resulting in very busy freight traffic on the Ping-Sui Railway. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chargé d'Affaires of the Japanese Embassy, Kato, recently went to Zhangjiakou and other areas to inspect the situation in eastern and northern Sui. He is scheduled to return to Beiping on the 14th after completing his mission. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Normal University held a school affairs meeting on the 13th, recognizing the resolute attitude of the Sui suppression soldiers in defending the territory and protecting the people. As winter is approaching and the border areas are bitterly cold, it was decided to initiate a donation campaign to purchase winter clothing for the soldiers to show appreciation. Furthermore, students at Peking University decided to stop using coal for three days starting on the 16th to save money to慰劳绥边将土. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources from Chinese residents in Zhangjiakou, three planes dropped bombs over Pingdiquan today, causing significant damage on the ground, but no loss of life has been reported.

<h3>Japan's Strengthening of Military Preparations Aimed at China and Russia; The Army Headquarters Publishes a Booklet Explaining the Significance; A Grand Plan to Be Completed Within Ten Years; Attempting to Realize the Ambition of Dominating East Asia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army authorities recently released a booklet on the replenishment of military equipment and its significance, which roughly stated that the time has come for Japan to replenish its military strength, and all obstacles must be removed, even at the cost of sacrifice. This comes at a time when the leaders of the Japanese military and political parties are engaged in fierce infighting. On the one hand, they advocate a clear demarcation of the powers of the parliament and the administrative organization, and on the other hand, they insist on their constitutional rights and are unwilling to let go. Therefore, the publication of this booklet is worthy of our special attention. The booklet also stated that in view of the gradual increase in the military strength of Soviet Russia and China, it is necessary for national defense to create a comprehensive country. In addition, it also lists the outline of the plan to strengthen the Japanese army, but denies that this plan will cause war or become an unproductive waste of the country. It also declares that the military has no intention of denying parliamentary politics and realizing a fascist military dictatorship. The only hope is to implement a universal mobilization of the wisdom of the people and carry out various reforms in accordance with constitutional procedures to achieve the goal of establishing a country for national defense.</p>
<p>The booklet also acknowledges the right of the public to inquire about why the army's ten-year military buildup plan requires a huge amount of £200 million, and explains that the key to Japan's foreign policy is to ensure the sound development of "Manchukuo", promote the complete harmony of China, "Manchuria", and Japan, and consolidate Japan's position in the Far East, making it the only stable force in the region, in line with the advancement of Japan's national power. The booklet lists in detail the number of soldiers, aircraft, anti-aircraft guns, and mechanized troops of the armies of Soviet Russia, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy for comparison. It is claimed that Soviet Russia has a total of 300,000 troops, 1,000 aircraft, and 1,000 tanks in the Far East, and that the fundamental key to Soviet Russia's foreign policy remains the same as in the past, but to Bolshevize the whole world. Soviet Russia's goal in the East is Japan, and in the West, it is Germany. This can be seen clearly from the declarations of the Soviet leaders. In order to achieve this fundamental goal, Soviet Russia is striving to form alliances with France and Czechoslovakia and to sign commercial and non-aggression treaties with Britain and other European powers so that it will not have to worry too much when something happens to Germany. Soviet Russia's strategy in the Far East is to try to instigate the powerful countries in East Asia to jointly hinder Japan's progress on the Asian continent. Since joining the League of Nations, Soviet Russia's victory in European diplomacy has been obvious. Furthermore, because its military preparations in the Far East have been expanded and completed, it is confident that it has a considerable grasp, so it has begun to make clear and fierce threats and cause various disputes in the areas bordering Russia, "Manchuria", and "Manchu" Mongolia, sometimes even violating treaties, crossing the border, attacking Japanese garrison troops, inciting "Manchu" soldiers and local natives to mutiny, kidnapping "Manchu" and Korean people, and plundering Japanese fishing boats in the northern territorial waters. In addition, there are various atrocities that cannot be enumerated. Although Japan has repeatedly lodged protests and demanded compensation, they have all been ignored.</p>
<p>It is heard that the purpose of Soviet Russia's construction sequence in the Far East is to manage transportation and traffic from Moscow and to increase economic productivity so that the Soviet Russian army in the Far East can be self-sufficient. At present, the transportation convenience in the Siberian part is far better than at the end of the Russo-Japanese War. The Soviet Russian troops stationed in the Far East can now supply themselves with food and no longer rely on others. The booklet mentions the military preparations in China, saying that China's administration is now unified. If it fights with foreign countries, the total number of soldiers who can go to the battlefield is no less than 2 million, and because of the training and equipment improvement by foreigners, the efficiency of the Chinese army has greatly increased, which cannot be compared with the past. Japan should not ignore this fact, and China has also obtained the help of the United States and other powers in recent years and has a very large air force. The booklet also stated that the Japanese military should have adopted a broad military preparation plan at the time of the "Manchurian Incident", but due to the uncertainty of the future and the lack of economic resources, it could not achieve anything. It had to choose the most important ones to implement. However, at present, the military is determined to implement the increase in military preparations, even if there are obstacles, in order to ensure that the painful experiences of the past 30 years will not be seen again in the future. Starting from next winter, the Japanese military has drafted a plan to enable Japan to maintain a balance with other powers and avoid the outbreak of war. It is heard that the main points of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Increase the strength of the air force.</p>
<p>(2) Increase the strength of the Manchurian garrison.</p>
<p>(3) Expand the convenience of education, mobilization, and supply.</p>
<p>(4) Organize military materials. This plan is scheduled to be completed within twelve years, and the most urgent ones will be implemented as soon as possible. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Establish a Continental Resource Investigation Agency; Matsui Advocates Establishing it Within the Cabinet</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) After attending the Industrial and Economic Conference in Keijo, Korea, and traveling to northern Korea, Manchuria, and northern China for inspection, Matsui, the Director of the Resources Bureau, returned to Tokyo on the morning of the 13th. Regarding the development of resources in various places, he said that the future of Manchuria's industrial resources is very promising. For example, the coal mine recently discovered in Changjiuling near Tieling has a total reserve of 22 million tons, which is a rare coal mine in the world. Promising oil shale mines have also been discovered in Yilan along the Songhua River. In addition to these mineral resources, the industrial five-year plan has also made significant progress. This is also the case in northern China. Northern China should be jointly operated with foreign capital. Chemical industry is more prosperous in northern Korea, with the Mudanjiang River and Dongbiandao areas being the richest. Therefore, after Korea and Manchuria are linked together, the future of their resources may be even more promising. Furthermore, the application of Japan's domestic economic control to Manchuria and northern China has caused various problems. Therefore, the mediation plan I advocate is to turn the continental resource development and investigation agencies of Korea, Manchuria, and northern China into an organic and consistent unified continental resource development control system within the cabinet. This plan has received enthusiastic support everywhere, so I will work hard to realize it in the future. (13th Domei Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Army in North China has consulted the central leadership on Sino-Japanese diplomatic opinions and has replied agreeing to stop discussing all pending issues, in order to end the situation in a paragraph. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japan Daily News's editorial today, titled "Our Wrong Approach to Negotiations," is quite noteworthy. The following is a summary of the outline of the article: If we allow ourselves to speak frankly, Japan made a big mistake when it began negotiations with China. In other words, the two issues of preventing unfortunate events and adjusting relations were both raised at the same time during the negotiations, which is unreasonable. Since adjusting relations is an extremely difficult task, it is difficult to succeed under the posture of threat and under the emotional heat, so we should carefully choose the appropriate time to engage in such work. However, unfortunately, our diplomatic authorities, under the protracted diplomatic situation, disregarded the importance of the matter and hastily began negotiations with China. As a result, the longer the negotiation time, the more it will arouse the anti-Japanese movement, so it is no coincidence that new unfortunate events have occurred one after another. Seeing this, the recent case is the result of the Nanjing negotiations, which is no exaggeration. Japan's only path at present is to immediately and decisively stop the negotiations. The issue of preventing communism in North China and other issues that are not directly related to the unfortunate anti-Japanese case should be left to future disposal. The current effort should be limited to stopping the current anti-Japanese movement and preventing the occurrence of new cases as soon as possible. The empty theory held by the bookworms in the diplomatic world, that unfortunate cases cannot be prevented unless relations are adjusted, should be abandoned immediately. If the anti-Japanese movement can be eradicated fundamentally, then the path to adjusting Sino-Japanese relations will naturally be discovered. If relations between the two countries still cannot be adjusted after the anti-Japanese movement is eliminated, then Japan should resort to other decisive methods to achieve its goals.

<h3>Wang Jun Died in a Plane Crash in Gansu, Remains Embalmed in Tianshui</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) After the shocking news of the death of Wang Jun, the commander of the Third Army, in a plane crash in Gansu reached Nanjing, Central News Agency reporters immediately went to the army's Nanjing office, Wang's residence, and various places where Wang's friends were located to inquire about the truth. The following is a record of what Nanjing has learned about Wang's unfortunate passing: Wang Jun's troops were originally stationed along the Jinpu Railway, responsible for security duties for many years. In May of the lunar calendar, he was ordered to lead his troops west to Gansu to carry out bandit suppression work in the Northwest. The remnants of bandits in the Longdong area had been gradually suppressed. On the 8th of this month, Wang, alone with a pilot, took off from Tianshui in a reconnaissance plane to scout out the situation of the remaining bandits. Unexpectedly, when flying not far from Mayingzhen, the engine suddenly failed and the plane began to descend. The area was mountainous and there was no place to land, causing the plane to crash into a mountain and catch fire. Wang and the pilot were both burned to death. After the accident, the local garrison immediately telegraphed Tianshui to notify Wang's headquarters. The unit urgently dispatched personnel who arrived on the 9th to collect Wang's remains, which were moved to Tianshui. At the same time, a report was telegraphed to the Military Affairs Commission. It is reported that Wang's remains were embalmed in Tianshui on the 12th and will soon be transported back to his hometown for burial. Wang Jun, styled Zhiping, was from Chenggong County, Yunnan Province. He was 46 years old and graduated from the Yunnan Military Academy. He served successively as the commander of the First Division of the Yunnan Army stationed in Guangdong, the commander of the Third Army Division of the National Revolutionary Army, and was subsequently promoted to army commander, a member of the National Government Military Affairs Commission, a member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, and the commander of the Jinpu Railway Garrison. Last year, he was elected to the Central Executive Committee and is currently the commander of the Third Army and the commander of the First Column of the First Route Army of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Forces. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jun, the commander of the Third Army, died in a plane crash while flying from Tianshui to Longdong for an inspection. Due to transportation difficulties, the news was delayed. However, the rumors that the remains were moved to Pingliang are inaccurate. Wang's remains were embalmed in Tianshui on the 12th, not in Pingliang. The following is a brief biography of Wang: Wang Jun, styled Zhiping, was from Chenggong County, Yunnan Province. He graduated from the Yunnan Military Academy. In 1916, he defended the country and followed Zhu Peide, the current chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, leading the Yunnan Army from Guizhou and Guangxi to Guangdong to participate in the National Revolution. He was a loyal believer in the Three Principles of the People. He personally participated in the Guangdong campaigns to suppress Long Jiguang and Lu Rongting and in the pacification of Chen Jiongming in Dongjiang. After the failure of the Northern Expeditions in 1922 and 1924, he led his troops on expeditions in Hunan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi for more than a year. By 1926, he had recaptured Jiangxi, and his military exploits were most outstanding. After 1928, he participated in all unification and bandit suppression campaigns and was victorious in every battle. This was due to his usual care for his soldiers and his skillful guidance of his officers. He was self-disciplined and diligent throughout his life and was strict with his subordinates. He once taught his soldiers that "sweating a little more in peacetime means shedding a little less blood in wartime," which shows his diligence. He successively served as the commander of the First Army First Division of the Generalissimo's Guard Army, the commander of the First Army First Division of the Central Direct Yunnan Army, the commander of the Seventh Division of the Third Army of the National Revolutionary Army, the commander of the Third Army, the garrison commander of Nanchang, Jiangxi, the member of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the commander of the Jinpu Railway Garrison, and the member of the Central Committee. Since 1935, he was ordered to transfer from Xuzhou to the Northwest to suppress bandits, making many achievements in the three Long areas. He was also ordered to inspect key areas in Qinghai, Suiyuan, Mongolia, and Tibet, announcing the power and virtue of the central government to the Hui and Tibetan people, which also had a significant effect. He had great ambitions and planned to repay the party and the country in many ways. It is unexpected that his end would be like this. He was 46 years old this year. His mother is still alive, and he has three sons and two daughters, all of whom are of school age. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Amended Insurance Bill Passed Second Reading by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan held its 80th meeting on the morning of the 13th, attended by 64 members including Wu Kaixian. Ye Chucang presided over the meeting. The meeting discussed the report of the Commercial Law Committee on the amended Insurance Bill, and it was resolved to adopt the amended bill in the second reading.

The two cases of amending the Insurance Industry Law and formulating the Insurance Industry Implementation Law were also postponed for discussion at the next meeting of the Yuan. Ma Yinchu reported on the review process during the Yuan's discussion of the bill, stating that the Insurance Law had been promulgated for seven years and that the insurance situation today is different from the past. Therefore, after careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages, and with reference to the opinions of the Ministry of Industry and the Shanghai Insurance Industry Association, supplements and amendments have been made, such as adding special clauses, insurance interests, and reinsurance provisions, all to adapt to the actual needs of the domestic insurance situation. As the case is closely related to the Civil Law, it is hoped that all members of the Civil Law Committee present will provide more guidance in order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the legislation. After the speech, the chairman ordered the secretary to read the articles. After the first reading, the second reading discussion began.

The review amendment supplemented and amended it into four chapters on general principles, property insurance, personal insurance, and supplementary provisions, totaling 101 articles. What was passed in the second reading on the 13th still had the same number of chapters, but two articles were deleted, leaving 99 articles. The final result must await the third reading meeting before it can be decided. (13th Central Telegram)</p>

<h3>Brewing of the International Peace Conference</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt will personally attend the Pan-American Peace Conference in South America next month. In its nature, as the editorial said yesterday, this conference contains the implication of a new Monroe Doctrine. However, from another perspective, it can also be said that this is Roosevelt's first step towards working for international peace. According to Washington dispatches, Roosevelt is now preparing to convene an international conference to discuss ways to maintain peace. Regardless of whether this move can be realized, there is no doubt that Roosevelt wants to do his best for world peace. The Washington Naval Treaty is about to expire, there is no hope for the establishment of a new Locarno Treaty in Europe, and the power of the League of Nations has reached its lowest point. If Roosevelt takes the lead in international peace with the prestige of his election victory, it will certainly be an exciting and meaningful thing.</p>
<p>Is it possible to convene the "International Peace Conference"? Pessimists believe that American presidents often only talk but have no practical action. President Wilson put forward the ideal of the League of Nations, and the whole world followed his lead. After the League of Nations was signed, the United States temporarily refused to ratify it. In 1933, Roosevelt also actively advocated holding an international economic conference. After the conference was held in London, he temporarily changed his mind and refused to stabilize currency prices and reduce tariffs. Similarly, President Coolidge proposed the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and President Hoover proposed the Stimson Doctrine, refusing to recognize "Manchukuo." On the surface, they all sounded very good, but in reality, they rarely benefited peace. Therefore, even if President Roosevelt advocates convening an international peace conference now, how much practical effect it will have is still a question.</p>
<p>Judging from the past and present situation, the future of American peace diplomacy does indeed have great obstacles. However, we must also admit that Roosevelt's current position is at least different from that of Wilson in 1920, Coolidge in 1927, and Hoover in 1931. The biggest reason why American presidents cannot work hard for world peace lies in the constraints of the Senate. The establishment of a treaty requires a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate. Wilson's failure was due to the opposition of the Senate. Now, Roosevelt has the ability to absolutely control the Senate. In this election, the Democratic Party won 75 seats in the Senate, and the Republican Party only had 17 seats. The election of Democratic senators was mostly the result of Roosevelt's help. Therefore, Congress will not oppose any international agreement signed by Roosevelt. The failure of the London Economic Conference was because Roosevelt could not control the economic forces of various factions in the country at that time, so his proposals were uncertain. Now his foreign trade policy has become very concrete. He advocates reducing tariffs and stabilizing currency prices to promote international trade. The recent monetary agreement between the United States, Britain, and France, and the reciprocal tariff agreements between the United States and various European and American countries, all indicate the consistency of this policy. The situation in 1936 cannot be compared with that in 1933.</p>
<p>As for the nominal diplomacy of Hoover and the empty diplomacy of Coolidge, there are many reasons. Most of these reasons no longer exist. The personal leadership of Hoover and Coolidge was very low. Their personalities were far less great than those of Wilson and Roosevelt. Their political skills were also not as strong as theirs. During the Hoover era, the United States' preparedness in the Far East was insufficient. Therefore, its protest against Japan was only in writing and not in fact. After four years of actively increasing military preparations, the United States' voice in the Far East has increased a lot, because force is often the most effective backing for diplomacy. If Stimson were in today's situation, he would be able to do more than he did in 1931. Roosevelt is not an idealist like Wilson. He is very practical. He may be able to make good use of the United States' superior position in military and financial strength to save international peace from the crisis of war.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot be too optimistic, because the world's aggressive forces are now uniting and trying to undermine peace in various ways. The Washington Treaty system, the Locarno Treaty system, and the League of Nations system have all been destroyed. It takes great effort, great statesmen, and strong determination to rebuild world or regional collective peace. However, in the current international situation, which is at a critical moment, it is the time when "the hungry are easy to feed and the thirsty are easy to drink." We hope that the "International Peace Conference" will become a reality from an ideal, and we hope that this conference will have at least the same success as the Washington Conference of 1922 on the Far East issue.</p>
<h3>The Vigor of American Revival, Unprecedented Prosperity in All Industries, Increased Wages and Greatly Reduced Unemployment, Roosevelt Opens the World's Largest Bridge</h3>
<p>(New York) The song "Happy Days Are Here Again" sung by the Roosevelt government is gradually being realized. At present, American commerce has gradually become prosperous, and its prosperity is unprecedented. The cost of living has risen quite high. Wages in industries such as steel, automobiles, paper, and clothing have increased by 10% to 20%. Postmaster General Farley predicts that the number of gifts purchased by people before Christmas this year will be the largest in American history. The number of unemployed has decreased from a peak of 15 million in 1933 to less than 9 million. The total amount of wages paid nationwide is the highest since 1930. The gross income of farmers this year is approximately $7,850,000,000. President Roosevelt's determination to balance the budget and stabilize tax rates has had a positive impact on the stock market. Various businesses are now issuing dividends and stocks one after another. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>San Francisco President Roosevelt pressed a gold button in the White House today, and the world's largest bridge newly built in the East Port here immediately lit up with green lights, opening to traffic. At that time, several airplanes circled in the sky, and more than a dozen warships were stationed nearby. About 200,000 people gathered at the bridgehead to watch. Within two and a half hours after the new bridge was opened, more than 16,000 vehicles passed through. The toll collected per hour reached $4,000. If calculated at this speed, all the bridge construction costs can be recovered with interest within 770 days, instead of the 20 years estimated by financiers. This bridge has been planned for a hundred years, and this dream has now been realized. Therefore, people here will celebrate wildly for four days. The bridge construction project lasted for two years. The groundbreaking ceremony was held in mid-February 1933. The bridge is more than eight miles long and can be called the only large bridge in the world. It starts from San Francisco, crosses Yerba Buena Island, and reaches Oakland. The bridge pillars are 519 feet high and 235 feet deep in the water. The bridge cables are 28 inches in diameter. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>San Francisco The Governor of California, Merriam, cut the golden chain on the bridge, and thousands of cars immediately drove across the bridge. The bridge is eight and a quarter miles long and cost 90 million US dollars. Construction began on July 9, 1933, and was completed last month. The cost was shared by California and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, which purchased 62 million dollars in bonds. 6,000 people worked directly on the project. It is estimated that the toll revenue collected in the next 20 years can repay the construction costs. The bridge has two suspension sections, each 2,310 feet long, and two two-story tunnels, 540 feet long and 63 feet wide, that run through Yerba Buena Island in the middle of the bay to connect the two parts of the bridge.

<h3>World Peace Depends on Pacific Peace, Britain, America, and Australia Should Cooperate</h3>
<p>San Francisco Captain Dudley, a director of the Australian Bank and former technical director of the British Hanterley Peach Airplane Company, has been in contact with the British War Office for a year. He passed through here today on his return to Australia and said that world peace depends on peace in the Pacific. Peace in the Pacific depends on whether Britain, America, and Australia can quickly complete air defense and air routes. There is an absolute need to open up aviation between the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The future of the Pacific is in the hands of the three countries. The three countries should jointly complete the defense of the Pacific. The time is now. European wars can break out at any time. Britain, America, and Australia should form an English-speaking group to protect peace in the Pacific and let Europe handle its own problems. Dudley expressed satisfaction with the development of the aviation industry in the Pacific. He said that in addition to the Pacific route operated by United Airlines and the aviation lines connecting Australian, London, and European capitals by British Imperial Airways and Dutch Airlines, there are at least two major trunk lines under consideration. One line will be opened by Britain, from Honolulu to Brisbane, and the other will be opened by the United States, from Honolulu to New Zealand, and then extended from New Zealand to Australia. This section will probably be opened by an Australian company. Dudley finally said that this aviation line is actually the basis for strengthening air defense in the Pacific.

<h3>Tense German-Russian Relations, Russian Arrest of Foreign Nationals is a Prelude to a Major Case, Denies Secret Police Assassinated Stalin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Since the German ambassador to Russia, following government instructions, lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Union against the Soviet Union's arrest of five German nationals on charges of espionage and anti-Russian activities, the situation between Russia and Germany has become increasingly tense. According to news from the official German news agency, the five Germans arrested by the Soviet Union were completely innocent. Among them were music teachers, bookkeepers, and mechanics. The news agency's Moscow correspondent said that many Russians arrested at the same time as the Germans were related to the German embassy. Some were staff members of German schools or German Evangelical churches. According to a certain newspaper of the National Socialist Party, the chief of the Soviet secret police, Soskovsky, has been executed by shooting for allegedly plotting to assassinate Stalin. Soskovsky was the head of the Polish Department of the Soviet Secret Police. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) It is reported that in addition to the five Germans, there are also two British, nine Polish, and two Swiss nationals who have been arrested in Moscow. Some of them were going to Moscow to participate in the celebration of the "October Revolution." It is unfortunate that they have now been arrested. However, according to the Soviet police, their purpose in coming to Russia this time was only to contact Trotskyite followers inside and outside the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Among the arrested German nationals are Mr. Semmig, the leader of the Moscow branch of the German Dalisten Trading Company, and Mr. Leitz, the director of the Lisbon branch, which has left the branch company unmanaged. Many believe that this arrest storm is a prelude to a major case, which will still be prosecuted by Vyshinsky, the prosecutor in the famous Zinoviev and other counter-revolutionary cases. Today, various newspapers here have criticized the Soviet Union. The Berlin Daily News stated that in view of the Soviet Union's large-scale arrest of foreign nationals, it is almost entirely directed at the German people, and Germany should pay special attention to it. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Warsaw It is reported that more than 100 people have been arrested in Moscow for discovering a conspiracy to establish a fascist organization in Russia. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to official sources, there are no British nationals among the foreign nationals arrested in the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the Soviet authorities denied the news from Berlin that Soskovsky, the leader of the Soviet secret police, had been executed by shooting for allegedly plotting to assassinate Stalin. It is said that "the name Soskovsky is very common in Russia, and there is no such name among the key figures in the secret police. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy in Poland Decides to Upgrade, Delicate Relations with Germany</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) As a result of the meeting of bureau and section chiefs held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 13th, a request was made to the Ministry of Finance to increase the budget for the next year by 2 to 3 million yuan. Now, as a result of the budget review, it has been decided to upgrade the embassy in Poland to an embassy. It is said that the reason is that Poland has delicate diplomatic relations with Russia and Germany, and occupies an important position in diplomacy, so this move has been taken. In addition, the development of Japanese trade and commerce in various parts of the South Seas is of great importance. Therefore, new consulates have been established in several places in the South Seas. In addition, there is the establishment of an etiquette officer in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate various matters with foreign envoys stationed in Japan or exchange information.

<h3>International Labor Organization Forms Standing Committee, Meeting in Asia</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At the International Labor Conference, a resolution proposed by the labor representatives of India and Japan was passed in June this year, advocating the establishment of a standing committee to specialize in studying labor issues in Asian countries, and suggesting convening a labor conference of Asian countries. The Governing Body of the International Labor Office met today to discuss the above resolution. The Indian labor representative Yao Hee and the Chinese government representative Li Pingheng supported it, arguing that this standing committee should hold meetings in rotation in various Asian countries, and that representatives from all Asian countries should participate, and not be limited to representatives from China, Japan, and India alone. The Indian government representative, Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar, criticized Yao Hee's proposal and requested the establishment of a sub-committee to study the two issues of establishing a standing committee and convening an Asian labor conference. The Japanese government representative, Kitaoka, supported Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar's opinion, as did the Canadian government representative, Leggett, who said that all countries with interests in Asia should be allowed to participate in the standing committee.

<h3>Air Battle Between Two Armies Near Madrid, Spain, Government Denies Using Poison Gas, Continued Progress in the Counter-Offensive South of the Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid Several government aircraft and rebel aircraft engaged in their first air war over the capital this morning, lasting 30 minutes. Six rebel aircraft were hit, burned, and crashed to the ground. Two government aircraft were also shot down. According to official war reports, the government army launched an offensive at dawn today and was quite successful. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid The reduction in artillery fire from both sides over the past twelve hours suggests that the Nationalists' advance has been hampered, or that the artillery positions of that army have been destroyed by government aircraft. An air battle occurred in Madrid today, and at least one Nationalist aircraft was shot down. At present, the Nationalists seem to have concentrated elite troops on the Toledo Avenue, and the next major offensive will begin from there. Although the city of Madrid has been bombarded by artillery fire, the residents remain calm. The government has fresh troops with a strong military presence coming from Catalonia, and solemnly denies that poison gas was used in the fighting with the Nationalist army. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid The government gazette announced today that government troops have recaptured the Getafe airfield, and the threat of the rebels cutting off traffic to the capital has been greatly reduced. The government army's heavy artillery has also inflicted heavy damage on the rebels. The morale of the government army has been greatly boosted, and reports from other parties also indicate that the government army is winning on all fronts. (National News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Madrid According to semi-official sources, government troops have recaptured Getafe and other villages near the capital. A small detachment of Moors was completely surrounded by government troops in the Casa de Campo area in the western suburbs of the capital and was in a difficult situation. It is reported that in last night's fierce battle, the Nationalist army used its elite infantry, assisted by artillery and tanks. This small detachment of Moorish troops was far away from the main army, which led to their encirclement. The government army repelled the attackers, and then received reinforcements from two battalions of fresh troops, and launched a fierce counter-offensive, causing heavy damage to the Nationalist army, which was forced to retreat. It is reported that the corpses of foreign legionnaires and Moors are scattered everywhere. The government army claims to have captured 200 enemies and seized thousands of rifles. The surrounded Moorish soldiers are well-equipped with automatic weapons, but many believe that they will eventually surrender due to the heavy bombardment by the government army's artillery and the shooting from various high-rise buildings. The Nationalist army's artillery bombardment was even stronger today, and the rumbling sound shook the entire city. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Lisbon It is undeniable that poison gas has been widely used in the Spanish Civil War. It has been used for 118 days now. According to news from the front line, Nationalist army officers have told people that the government army has used poison gas bombs in an attempt to disperse the Nationalist army. Therefore, the Nationalist army may be forced to use poison gas as well. According to a recent telegram from Reuters' front-line reporter, there has been no change in the positions of the two armies in the past 24 hours. The reports that the government militia has recaptured Madrid's Getafe airfield and repelled the Nationalist army in Casa de Campo, the site of the former king's private garden, seem to be exaggerated. Reuters' Madrid reporter reported by long-distance telephone this morning that government aircraft did bomb the Getafe airfield yesterday. At the same time, Reuters' special reporter accompanying the Nationalist army west of the Manzanares River also telegraphed last night that the Moroccan army could only advance half a mile on the Casa de Campo to Toledo front line. It is reported that the government's ability to prevent the Nationalist army from advancing in the past five days has been entirely due to the newly produced 20mm anti-tank guns and the well-trained and accurate gunners. The Nationalist army often uses tanks as a tool for charging during its advance, but it has unexpectedly encountered strong opponents in recent days. The anti-tank guns used by the government militia fire extremely accurately, causing heavy damage and greatly reducing the chance of advancement. According to reports from all sides, there are many women among the government's fallen soldiers. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Rebels Optimistic About the War, Strategic Emphasis on Artillery Bombardment</h3>
<p>Talavera de la Reina (100 kilometers southwest of Madrid) A special dispatch from our reporter: People in the Nationalist army here are optimistic about the future of the war. According to the authorities, a small detachment of Nationalist troops crossed the Manzanares River (outside the south gate of Madrid) last night for reconnaissance. At the same time, a column led by Colonel Yague, using tanks and artillery as cover, advanced towards Madrid, now only 100 meters away from the rooftops of the city. The weather was bad yesterday, and the aircraft of the Nationalist army were unable to fly out, but they plan to fly to Madrid tomorrow to drop leaflets, advising residents to flee to the safe zone in the northeast corner of the capital to avoid relentless bombs. The General Headquarters here is now focusing on artillery bombardment due to the government army's determination to resist and its willingness to die in battle. If infantry is used to attack the city, many lives will be sacrificed. For example, the "North Station" in the city, which was originally a trench dug by the government army for defense, is also the place where the Nationalist army's artillery fire is concentrated. Every day, shells fall like rain, and part of it has now been destroyed. In addition, there have been several large fires in Madrid in recent days. One of them occurred in a gas plant and has been burning for three days without being extinguished. Regarding the war situation, the battle at the "Toledo" bridge outside the south gate of Madrid and the town of Carabanchel, six kilometers away from the city, was very fierce yesterday. The government army had many machine guns lined up in the "Toledo" bridge area, and gun emplacements were also installed in the houses in the town of Carabanchel, but they were eventually captured by the Nationalist army. Afterwards, 300 corpses of government soldiers were found in the Carabanchel town hospital. In a trench, 30 members of the government militia were found, all breathless, but still tightly holding machine guns, which shows their courage in resistance. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid A special dispatch from our reporter: The weather was bad on the southern front of the capital yesterday, and the line of sight was unclear. Therefore, the aircraft of the Nationalist army were unable to sortie, and only the artillery bombarded the government army's positions. The government army also returned fire. In the evening, the artillery battle between the two armies was fierce. Before long, the government army's artillery fire stopped abruptly. At that time, looking from the Nationalist army's front line, smoke and fire were seen billowing near the highway from the western suburbs of Madrid to the province of Extremadura. Most of the houses there must have been hit and caught fire. (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Franco Does Not Advocate Impatience, Government Aircraft Strafe Enemy Troops</h3>
<p>Lisbon Many military experts here say that the reason why the Spanish Nationalist army has been slow to attack the capital is a strategy of General Franco, the commander-in-chief. Franco plans to deplete the enemy's combat power in the suburbs of the capital. Then, when the Nationalist army enters the city, the enemy will be exhausted and unable to fight fiercely in the streets. Thus, the Nationalist army can lose fewer lives. Therefore, even when the government militia seems to be weak, Franco is still unwilling to sacrifice lives and launch an all-out attack. A Nationalist army tank, with a Portuguese man inside, advanced to a certain point in the city yesterday, but was eventually forced to withdraw. Although a large number of guards chased and bombarded it during the withdrawal, it was still able to escape danger. This proves that the Nationalist army has mechanized units to help. If they are willing to engage in street fighting, they could have made greater progress than they have today in the past few days. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Madrid The National Defense Committee recently issued a communique stating, "Fifteen government aircraft flew to the vicinity of the capital yesterday afternoon to conduct reconnaissance. There were no traces of enemy troops in the Casa de Campo park in the western suburbs, but large numbers of enemy troops were seen concentrated in the towns of Upper Carabanchel and Lower Carabanchel in the southern suburbs, including infantry, cavalry, and tank units. Each of these aircraft was equipped with machine guns, four per aircraft, for a total of sixty. They immediately flew low and strafed the enemy troops with machine guns. The rebels were caught off guard. Although they opened anti-aircraft fire, they failed to hit anything, and fled in all directions, abandoning countless corpses and wounded. Unfortunately, due to bad weather, two of the government aircraft touched the Guadarrama Mountains in the dense fog, causing them to crash." (Havas News Agency, 13th)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Corps Agrees to Assist in Protecting the Safety of Citizens in the Capital</h3>
<p>Madrid – Foreign Minister Téllez Juaréz and Minister of Justice Olivan recently arrived here from the port of Valencia. They immediately convened the National Defense Committee (i.e., those responsible for remaining on duty) to discuss the war situation, in order to return to the port of Valencia and report to the Cabellero cabinet. It is generally understood that the meeting resulted in several important resolutions. Furthermore, the diplomatic corps proposed to the National Defense Committee to cooperate in protecting the safety of civilians within the city of Madrid, which was accepted by the committee. To this end, a Civilian Safety Protection Committee was established, with the Mexican Ambassador to Spain as Chairman, and representatives from the United Kingdom and Argentina as Vice-Chairmen. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ships Transport Supplies</h3>
<p>Valencia City – The Soviet Russian ship "Komsomol" arrived here recently, carrying 22,000 sets of children's clothing, 2,847 tons of corn, 1,000 tons of flour, 43 tons of sturgeon, 50 tons of Italian pasta and rapeseed sauce. It was immediately unloaded and brought ashore for the use of supporting the military and civilians. When the ship's crew went ashore, the residents cheered them warmly. In the evening, a famous play was performed at the Apolo Theatre to entertain them. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>French Left-Wing Parliamentarians Discuss the Situation in Spain, Planning to Request the Government to Restore Freedom of Trade with Spain</h3>
<p>(Paris) Representatives from the left-wing parties, i.e., the majority parties, in the Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to meet today to discuss the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War. They will also visit Prime Minister Blum to request the restoration of free trade with the Spanish Republic. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Neutrality Committee Meeting, Intense Arguments between Italian and Russian Representatives, Unanimously Adopted Supervisory Measures</h3>
<p>(London) The Adjustment Committee of the Non-Intervention Agreement on the Spanish Civil War held a long meeting yesterday afternoon. The Italian and Russian representatives engaged in mutual accusations during the meeting, which extended to 9:30 PM, lasting a total of five and a half hours. A communiqué released after midnight declared that the committee had approved the plan to establish a supervisory system in Spain, but it could only be implemented after the governments concerned had submitted amended drafts and approved them. The Italian and Russian representatives engaged in heated debate, with the Italian representative accusing the Soviet Union of interfering in Spanish affairs, stating that the Soviet Union's creed was a creed of war, and that not only the future of Spain, but the future of all civilized countries in Europe was in danger. The Soviet Russian representative responded that the Italian representative was playing a German-made tune, and that the distinction today was not between communism and fascism, but between war and peace, that is, between countries that glorified aggressive war and countries that abhorred war and desired peace. Italy had removed its mask and stood openly before the world as an aggressor and a destroyer of treaties. The committee considered four complaints filed by the Soviet Union regarding Italy's violation of the Non-Intervention Agreement, but due to insufficient evidence, the committee was unable to determine that Italy had violated the agreement. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Adjustment Committee of the Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session at 4 PM today, at which the outline of the Supervisory Committee's plan was unanimously adopted. This committee will consist of two, working separately in the territories controlled by the Spanish government forces and the Nationalist forces, to monitor the Spanish-Portuguese border, as well as Spanish ports and airfields. It is estimated that the Supervisory Committee will require 1,000 personnel, at a cost of no less than one million pounds. Regarding this matter, the Adjustment Committee submitted a reservation, to be consulted with their respective governments to determine whether the number of personnel could be appropriately reduced. In addition, the Soviet government had previously submitted a reply to the accusations by other countries of violating the Non-Intervention Agreement. The Adjustment Committee specifically reviewed it today. After discussion, except for one point that still required further investigation, the rest were considered satisfactory. During the discussion, there was a heated argument between the Italian and Russian representatives. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Complete Agreement on Three Major Issues</h3>
<p>(Vienna) According to informed sources, in addition to what has already been stated in the communiqué, the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian Protocol signed today also mentions the following issues: (1) Amendment of the League of Nations Covenant; (2) The struggle against communism; (3) The three countries may grant recognition to the Spanish Nationalist government in the future, but the date of recognition has not yet been decided; (4) Regarding the Locarno Five-Power Conference, the three countries have decided to adopt Italy's opinion. In addition, the issue of the restoration of the Austrian Habsburg royal family was not mentioned in the protocol. Regarding the first issue above, it is heard that the three governments agreed to use the speech made by Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt at the League of Nations General Assembly in September as the basis for amending the covenant. Schmidt's speech advocated three points: (1) The League of Nations should be universalized; (2) Various issues should not be resolved through secret diplomacy; (3) The League of Nations Covenant should be separated from the various peace treaties of the European War. Regarding the second issue, the struggle against communism, the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian governments did not endorse the German government's suggestion to organize an anti-communist crusade, but advocated that the three countries should adopt a policy of joint cooperation to oppose communist propaganda within their respective countries. Furthermore, after the signing of this month's three-nation protocol, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano gave a speech to the press, stating that the Italian and Austrian governments had decided to continue to adopt a constructive policy, similar to the Rome Protocols jointly signed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the late Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, and the late Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss in March 1934. This was the beginning of this constructive policy, and it should naturally continue to be followed. The Hungarian Foreign Minister, Kanya, also gave a speech to the press, saying that he firmly believed that the achievements of the three-nation conference would strengthen the peace situation. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Hungary Feels Disappointed That Border Revisions Were Not Mentioned</h3>
<p>Budapest – The Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers did not mention Hungary's request for border revisions in the protocol signed in Vienna today. This is quite disappointing to Hungarian political circles, as they are satisfied with Italy and Austria's open support for Hungary's request to rearm, but in addition to this, they still hoped to obtain more practical results. Now that this is not the case, they cannot help but feel disappointed. In addition, political figures believe that the Austrian and Hungarian recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia was expected. The fact that the communiqué issued after the signing of the three-nation protocol used rather vague language regarding Germany is due to Italy's concern about Austria's independence. As for the statement in the communiqué that "the three countries will respectively conclude bilateral agreements to develop trade relations," political figures did not comment on it, only stating that the trade relations between Italy and Hungary have been greatly affected since the devaluation of the Italian lira, and have not yet improved. Official sources, on the other hand, said that the results of the Vienna three-nation conference are quite satisfactory, as the friendship between Italy, Austria, and Hungary will be further strengthened as a result.

<h3>The Little Entente Expresses Resentment at the Three Countries' Unilateral Action</h3>
<p>Bucharest – After the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers' meeting recognized Hungary's right to military equality, political figures here are very resentful, believing that although Austria has restored conscription, Hungary should not follow suit, because Austria can say that its borders are threatened, while Hungary has no such excuse. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Prague – Political figures recently declared that the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers' meeting's recognition of Hungary's right to military equality is a unilateral action by those countries, which is related to the entire Little Entente, not just Czechoslovakia. It must be understood that all issues can be resolved through negotiations, but unilateral actions are strongly opposed by the countries of the Little Entente. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Italian Prime Minister Mussolini expressed support for Hungary's claim to revise the treaty earlier, and the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers' meeting later recognized Hungary's right to military equality. Officials here recently explained that this is merely an empty expression to Hungary, with only a superficial appearance. Otherwise, the countries of the Little Entente will take effective self-defense measures in response as soon as the military clauses contained in the Treaty of Trianon are violated. As for the actual results achieved by the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers' meeting, since the signatory countries of the Rome Protocol can use gradual and fundamental methods to improve mutual relations with other countries in the Danube region, Yugoslavia, while remaining committed to the regional security system established by the Little Entente, will not refuse the establishment of bilateral agreements between the signatory countries of the Rome Protocol. In short, Yugoslavia is eagerly anticipating closer relations with Italy. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Arrives in Budapest, Receives a Warm Welcome</h3>
<p>Budapest – Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano arrived here at 1:10 PM today. Hungarian Prime Minister Darányi, personnel from the Italian Embassy, representatives from the Italian Fascist Party branch, and most Italian expatriates welcomed him at the station. After Count Ciano alighted from the train, he inspected a company of infantry and a company of Hungarian youth corps at the station. Then, amid the cheers of the crowd, he traveled by car to his residence to rest. Italian and Hungarian national flags were displayed along the route, creating a lively atmosphere. When the car arrived at the residence, the crowd gathered outside the gate, cheering and paying their respects. Count Ciano then stepped out onto the balcony to express his gratitude.

<h3>League of Nations Seeks Opinions on Amending the Covenant, Forty Countries Have Responded</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations previously sought opinions from member states regarding the amendment of the Covenant, in accordance with the resolution passed by the special session of the League of Nations General Assembly in July. As of now, forty countries have submitted replies. Belgium's reply has also arrived, and its full text will be published tomorrow. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>This Year's Nobel Prize Winners: Literature, Chemistry, Physics</h3>
<p>Stockholm – The 1936 Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded to the famous American playwright Eugene O'Neill. The Physics Prize will be shared by Professor Hess of the University of Innsbruck in Austria and Dr. Anderson of the California Institute of Technology in the United States. The Chemistry Prize will be awarded to Professor Debye of Berlin for his contribution to molecular structure. The Nobel Prize is a donation from Alfred Nobel, the famous Swedish scientist who invented dynamite. The prize money is distributed by the Board of Trustees from the income of the fund. Nobel died on December 10, 1896, leaving an estate of 1.75 million pounds. The first prize was awarded on the fifth anniversary of Nobel's death, and it has since been stipulated that a decision will be made annually, divided into several categories: physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, and those who have made the most significant contributions to peace. In 1935, each prize exceeded 10,000 pounds. Eugene O'Neill, who won the Literature Prize this year, is not only the greatest playwright in the United States, but has also gained international fame.

<h3>Vienna Conference Acknowledges Equal Military Rights for Hungary and Austria, Three Countries Established Coordination on General Issues, Bilateral Agreements to Develop Trade to be Reached</h3>
<p>Vienna – The Three-Nation Conference of Italy, Austria, and Hungary concluded today, and a communiqué was issued acknowledging Hungary's equal military rights. This move indicates that Hungary has followed in the footsteps of Germany and Austria in abolishing the military constraints of the peace treaty, and can now implement conscription and carry out large-scale military restoration. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>Vienna – The Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian foreign ministers signed the Three-Nation Protocol at 5:30 PM today. After the signing, a communiqué was immediately issued, stating that the Three-Nation Conference recognized the legitimacy of the demands by Austria and Hungary for equal military rights. This demand is based on "the fundamental principles of justice." The governments of Italy, Austria, and Hungary will now maintain constant contact with each other to enhance these principles. Italy will also consider Austria and Hungary's expectations of participating in the economic development of Abyssinia. In addition, the communiqué also stated that Italy, Austria, and Hungary have reached a satisfactory agreement on general issues directly related to the three countries. As for the economic cooperation between the three countries, there will be no changes at this time. Italy, Austria, and Hungary will respectively conclude bilateral agreements to develop mutual trade relations. Regarding the relations between Germany and Austria after the signing of the German-Austrian Agreement on July 11, Austrian Foreign Minister Schmidt presented a report, which was considered satisfactory by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano and Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya. The Austrian and Hungarian foreign ministers were also satisfied that Germany and Italy had decided to cooperate amicably in the Danube region after Count Ciano visited Germany and held talks with Chancellor Hitler and Foreign Minister von Neurath. The three governments reiterated that the supplementary clauses to the Rome Protocols signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary in March of this year are still in effect. Austria and Hungary also legally recognized Italy's annexation of Abyssinia. The various issues discussed above and the results achieved have now been recorded in a protocol signed by Italy, Austria, and Hungary. The communiqué concludes by announcing that the next Three-Nation Conference will be held in the Hungarian capital, but the date has not yet been determined. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Seventeenth Session of the League of Nations Assembly (Continued 2)</h3>
<p>1.  The Abyssinian Representative Qualification Issue... 2. The Work of Our Country's Representatives in Various Committees (A) First Committee (B) Second Committee (C) Third Committee (D) Fourth Committee (E) Fifth Committee on Mining (F) Sixth Committee... 3. The Reorganization Issue of the League of Nations... 4. The Speech of Our Representative in the General Discussion of the Assembly... 5. The Process of Our Country's Election as Member of the Administrative Council and Judge of the Hague... 6. Conclusion...</p>
<p>B. Second Committee</p>
<p>This committee specializes in discussing financial, economic, and health issues. Regarding health, the committee passed a proposal to prepare for the Far East Rural Hygiene Conference in Java next year. Our representative, Mr. Jin, stood up and expressed his opinion, stating that our country is one of the most important countries in international cooperation, and therefore feels particularly interested in the aforementioned Far East Rural Hygiene Conference. Our delegation sincerely hopes for the success of the conference, he said. The committee then discussed the financial and economic situations of various countries. At the time, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland had just begun to devalue their currencies, which provided many representatives with the opportunity to speak. Our representative, Mr. Jin, stood up to explain the economic situation of our country in recent years, stating that our country has received assistance from friendly banks, especially the assistance of the British government, and therefore has achieved great success since the implementation of the legal currency. Finally, it has also received the approval of the United States, so our country's formal foreign trade has embarked on the right track, which is very obvious. At the same time, it can further prove that our country's currency reform is actually beneficial to foreign traders in our country. Mr. Jin continued to say that the devaluation of a national bank's currency is enough to revitalize international trade. Our country feels delighted and is happy to follow the new trend of international trade, and is grateful that the world economy will recover and prosper again. Our country will again become the world's market. Finally, Mr. Jin raised international attention to the seriousness of smuggling in North China and its impact on our country's national economy, people's livelihood, and international trade, and hoped for international cooperation to resolve this difficulty.</p>
<p>C. Third Committee Regarding</p>
<p>The organization and purpose of the committee have already been described earlier. As for the Disarmament Conference, small countries, needless to say, strongly hope that the conference will be revived in order to work towards future peace. Even the opinions of major countries such as England, France, and Russia are very consistent, and they also advocate the organization of a permanent committee to specialize in studying disarmament issues and the procedures for convening the conference. After a heated debate, the committee passed its report and transferred it to the General Assembly. The report consists of fifteen sections, stating the committee's opinions on the Disarmament Conference, and passing the following proposal: "The General Assembly firmly believes in the need to continue and intensify efforts to reduce armaments in order to implement Article 8 of the League of Nations, and warmly welcomes the organization of a Disarmament Conference at an early date. The committee hereby requests the Administrative Council to inform the governments of all countries that previously participated in the Disarmament Conference of the Third Committee's report on this issue and its meeting minutes." This proposal and report have been passed by the General Assembly, and the long-dormant World Disarmament Conference has a glimmer of hope. Although there are still many difficulties, it can be said to be one of the achievements of this session of the League of Nations Assembly. If all countries can show their sincerity in disarmament in the future, and the people of the world do not forget to continue their efforts for peace, future peace may not be impossible to expect.</p>
<p>D. Fourth Committee</p>
<p>This committee specializes in discussing the work and expenses of the Secretariat, the League of Nations budget, and the membership fees of various member states. Our representative, Mr. Liang, expressed his opinion, stating that the management work of the Secretariat is extremely important, so various tasks must be implemented in a rational manner, because whether the League of Nations can win the trust of the people of various countries is closely related to it. Regarding the issue of the Secretariat's staff, our representative, Mr. Liang, said that our country pays more than 1.2 million gold francs in membership fees every year, but there is only one Chinese staff member in the Secretariat. This is certainly not the Secretary-General's mistake, but it is hoped that when our country recommends staff, the Secretariat must accept them. Mr. Liang continued to say that some countries have many members in various agencies of the Secretariat, so the salaries they pay almost exceed the total amount of membership fees their country pays each year, while some countries do not even have a single staff member in the Secretariat. The annual salary obtained by Chinese staff from the Secretariat is only equal to three percent of the annual fee paid by our country. Therefore, our delegation reserves the right to recommend staff for future concrete proposals, he said. The reporter feels that Mr. Liang's proposal is quite important and is an event that our delegation should have paid attention to in the past. If we want to rectify diplomacy in Geneva, the staff in the Secretariat can provide various convenient assistance. It goes without saying that the various main tasks of the Secretariat have always been controlled by a small number of staff. Even many small countries, compared to the membership fees they pay each year, are less than one-fifth of our country, but their positions as staff in the Secretariat are often more superior than those of Chinese staff. Therefore, when the League of Nations has problems related to their country, various procedures and important information have already been prepared before their country's representatives arrive in Geneva. The salary issue is certainly decided. Our country certainly does not hope to be fully compensated for its losses, but at the very least, it cannot only fulfill its obligations without enjoying its rights. Especially in order to make our country's relationship with the League of Nations closer and to achieve practical cooperation, at least one Chinese staff member is needed in each of the information, legal, political, cultural, cooperation, opium, transportation, transportation, financial, and economic departments. This is due to the fact that since Secretary-General Avenol took office, he has failed to rationalize the distribution of the Secretariat's staff and has pursued policies that are often unbalanced. We hope that he can have considerable awareness and correct this. On the other hand, it is reported that our delegation has made considerable preparations for the above issue and is preparing to submit a list. It is also reported that there are four candidates on each list, and the League of Nations Secretariat is preparing to accept two of them. Regardless of whether it is true or not, or regardless of who is recommended, we feel that there are several important conditions that our delegation must pay attention to. First, the person recommended must not be coming for a job, and should not have the mentality of securing a position. At the very least, the person should be able to take responsibility and make considerable contributions to both the League of Nations and our side. Second, there is no need to ask about the person's private relationships or their status in their own country, but attention must be paid to their character and morality. It is better not to recommend someone than to recommend someone with bad behavior, which would damage the credibility of recommending staff. Third, the person must meet the requirements in terms of excellent academic knowledge and language skills, and efforts must be made to match the person's strengths with the work they are recommended for, so that they can achieve considerable results. Moreover, such people can be trained as experts in a relatively short period of time and can make considerable contributions to the work of the League of Nations and to the future of our country. If our delegation can carefully select staff based on the above or more complete conditions, the work in Geneva will certainly not feel constrained in the future.</p>
<p>E. Fifth Committee In this committee, the issue related to our country is the opium issue. When the committee discussed the report of the Opium Advisory Committee, the Portuguese representative spoke, stating that it is necessary to discuss the restriction of the production of raw materials for narcotics. According to the number of legitimate needs in the world, it is 540,000 tons. However, in fact, the production of raw and prepared opium and narcotics in the world exceeded the above number by 1,000 tons in 1933 and 540 tons in 1934. This figure does not include the 12,000 tons of Chinese opium and narcotics produced annually. The importance of restricting the production of the above raw materials is very obvious, he said. He continued to say that under this kind of production restriction, countless Chinese farmers continue to plant 100,000 hectares of opium poppies every year. We have nothing to say to China, he said. Our representative, Mr. Qian, replied, stating that the main difficulty for our government in banning drugs is that it cannot be effective without international cooperation. If the Opium Advisory Committee informs the countries concerned to take all possible measures to crack down on their people engaging in illegal sales in our country and severely punish this kind of trade, our government will do its best to make further efforts in the implementation of our national drug ban plan. Regarding the number of narcotics produced in our country mentioned by the Portuguese representative, our representative, Mr. Qian, replied, stating that the number of narcotics produced in China mentioned by the Portuguese representative was extracted from the report of the Opium Advisory Committee. Our representative has already proposed revisions to this number, but the Portuguese representative insisted that this number is in the report and that the number is very accurate, he said. When our representative, Mr. Qian, pointed out that our representative in the report's meeting minutes had reservations about the 12,000-ton figure mentioned by the American representative as proof, the Portuguese representative remained silent and did not answer. The report was then passed.</p>

<p>Bandit-Puppet-Mongolian Troops Invade Sui. Wuchuan Situation Suddenly Tense. Planning to Invade Sui Border in Three Routes. Over a Hundred Military Officers from a Certain Side Go to Supervise the Battle.</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: The serious situation on the border of Sui province, after shifting from Suidong to Suibei, has seen bandit, puppet, and Mongolian troops gather in Suibei in recent days. Under the cover of airplanes and tanks from a certain side, they are attacking Suibei from Bailingmiao every day, with the aim of capturing Wuchuan and approaching Guisui. Therefore, the situation in Wuchuan is suddenly becoming serious. However, every determined attack only involves a small number of troops and has been repelled by the defending forces and militia. They have not succeeded. Although the atmosphere is extremely tense, these are only small contacts and not yet a formal main force battle.</p>
<h3>Puppet-Bandit Troops Gradually Dispatched. Planning to Invade Sui Border in Three Routes. Over a Hundred Military Officers from a Certain Side Go to Supervise the Battle.</h3>
<p>Currently, bandit, puppet, and Mongolian troops are still being gradually dispatched. In addition to the cavalry participating in the invasion of Sui, Wang Ying's bandit troops are also marching towards Bailingmiao for concentration. Wang's bandit force currently only has over 5,000 men. The puppet Mongolian troops now scattered in various counties in Chahar North are only over 1,000 men. Most of them have already arrived in Bailingmiao. The 3,000 plus puppet Mongolian troops under Zhuo Shihai's command stationed in Niuyangqun are also moving towards Suibei and concentrating in Bailingmiao. The bandit troops who opened from Guyuan Chongli in the west a few days ago have now arrived in Shangdu. It is said that they will be slightly reorganized and also concentrated in Bailingmiao. The bandit troops from Rehe are still continuing to open to the west and are stationed in the Guyuan Chongli area. Two squadrons of a certain side's military force have now opened to Kangbao and Baochang and are advancing westward one after another. It is said that their major destination is also Bailingmiao. Recently, a certain side must send airplanes from Duolun and Shangdu every day to偵察 the situation of the Sui border positions. The ammunition of the bandit-puppet troops is still being transported westward by car from Duolun Zhangbei every day. The general supply station of the Chahar North armies has now been relocated to Duolun. This place is the supply station of Li Shouxin's puppet troops and only supplies Li's troops stationed in Daqinggou and Nanhaogan with ammunition and other materials.</p>
<p>Bandit Troops Attack Sui in Three Routes</p>
<p>The puppet-bandit-Mongolian troops are invading Suiyuan from Suibei, Suidong, and Suixi in three routes. The deployment of each route's front line is as follows: Bao Yueqing, Zhuo Shihai, and other Mongolian troops combine into one route and approach Wuchuan and Guisui from Suibei. Li Shouxin's troops, in addition to those in Qinggou and Nanhaogan, combine with Zhang Haipeng, Gan Jingxiu's entire force, the bandit troops from Rehe, and a certain side's squadron into one route and jointly attack Suidong. Wang Ying's troops will wait for the bandit-Mongolian troops to concentrate in Bailingmiao before combining into one route and taking Guyang along the north side of Yinshan. After succeeding, Wang will immediately lead his infantry and cavalry directly to Baotou and penetrate deep into Suixi and the Hetao. Currently, most of Li Shouxin's artillery is in Nanhaogan. Those concentrated in Shangdu are mostly cavalry. Li himself remains in Shangdu to command everything. Over a hundred military officers from a certain side arrived at Jiabusi on the eighth of this month and will soon go to Shangdu and Bailingmiao to infiltrate Li Shouxin's and Wang Ying's puppet-bandit troops to command and supervise the battle.</p>
<p>Grain Prices Soar in Various Counties in Chahar North</p>
<p>In the past, grain carts from various counties in Chahar North often went to Xinghe and Jining (Pingdiquan) in Suidong to purchase grain. Now, due to the tense situation, they can no longer go. Coal from Suiyuan and Jinbei has also stopped being transported recently, causing extreme panic in various counties in Chahar North regarding food and fuel. Grain prices have therefore soared endlessly. Furthermore, the frequent redeployment of puppet-bandit troops, such as replenishing military supplies and paying for transit and departure expenses, has overwhelmed merchants. The burden on the people in various counties has increased sixfold compared to the past, causing everyone to frown and wail.</p>

<p>At noon on the 12th, Xiao Changsheng, a robber from Hunan, wearing short clothes and sneakers, carried two box guns and went to the Wuchang Candle Shop on Nanxiang East Street, pretending to borrow money from the shop assistant. Taking advantage of the unpreparedness of the people, he robbed twelve yuan in legal currency from the counter and fled. Two shop assistants secretly followed him. First they went east, then turned southwest, approaching the Nan Street Public Security Branch Bureau. The two shop assistants shouted loudly to catch the robber. The robber opened fire, first to the south and then to the north. One bullet hit Hou Jinyuan, the owner of the Hou Zhenyuan leather suitcase shop, in the left shoulder.

While passing through the area, he suddenly encountered six bandits who tied Lü up and robbed him of more than fifty yuan in legal currency. After passersby untied Lü, he immediately reported it to the police district in charge, who immediately sent police to pursue the bandits but did not catch them. Only a bag of clothes was found, which was also an item that Lü Jinpei had been robbed of. The Public Security Bureau was immediately notified to request a search. Zhang Hanwei, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, considered that it was the time of winter defense and the situation was unstable, and the bandits dared to rob in the urban area. On the 13th, he ordered his subordinates to solve the case within a limited time and bring the perpetrators to justice in order to maintain local security.</p>

Initially, the couple had a harmonious relationship and had one son and two daughters. Later, Erjie entered the Ruichangyong Silk Factory as a female worker and had some savings in hand. She had an affair with Xu Yongqing, the foreman of the factory, and regarded her husband as a thorn in her side. She claimed to eat vegetarian food and was determined to separate from her husband.

Wang Wuqiao, of Jinsha Yushun Porcelain Store, sent a forged telegram from Jingdezhen claiming that his father was sick, but when Wang rushed back, there was no such thing. Others, such as Sanyu Dayou Jin Company, Juegang Dayu Company, and Jinsha Xiechang Egg Shop, received forged telegrams fabricating market conditions and invited managers to Shanghai, all of which were deceived. They inquired with the Telegraph Bureau. Ding Zhusan was ordered by the Electric Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications to be transferred by the 통 Bureau to the court.

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank, in view of the extreme need to revitalize the rural economy, has greatly expanded its savings and loan business to farmers this year to meet the needs.

<h3>The Federation of Labor Unions Replies to the Asian Labor Conference Stating: - Promote the Desire for International Peace - Uphold Justice Based on the Purpose of the Conference - The Unprecedented Crisis in East Asia Can Be Resolved</h3>
<p>The Second Asian Labor Conference will be held in Japan starting on April 8th of next year. The conference sent a letter to the branch of the International Labor Bureau, which forwarded it to the Municipal Federation of Labor Unions, requesting that it send representatives to attend at that time. After receiving the letter, the Municipal Federation of Labor Unions submitted it to the Standing Committee for discussion. They all believed that the nature of the meeting was worth studying before Sino-Japanese relations were adjusted. Therefore, it was decided to inquire first and state the desire to promote international peace. The original letter is as follows: "To the esteemed colleagues, We have just received your letter stating that the Second</p>
<p>Asian Labor Conference</p>
<p>has been rescheduled to April 8, 9, and 10 of next year (1937) and will still be held in Japan. Please send representatives to participate at that time. A communication address is attached, and we are instructed to reply directly. We approve of the convening of the Asian Labor Conference and sincerely hope to send representatives to attend and join your association to seek happiness for Asian workers. However, the organization of your association is just beginning, and the environment is harsh, making it impossible for us to participate. We believe that the rampant imperialism, the tyranny of the capitalist class, the inequality of various treatments, and the instability of international peace make it necessary for all labor unions to unite and stand on the same front in order to improve the lives of workers and promote equality and the realization of peace. Furthermore, according to Article 2, Item 8 of your association's constitution, 'The purpose is to avoid war, establish international peace,</p>
<p>resist enemies of the state</p>
<p>and capitalism,' which coincides with our association's propositions. In addition to admiring it, we sincerely hope to join your association and jointly assume the responsibility of promoting social justice and international peace. However, looking back at the position of our country's workers today, they are subjected to the aggression of imperialism and the oppression of capitalists. The foundation of international peace has been destroyed by those with strong forces. Foreigners in China, under the cover of unequal treaties, have caused the Shanghai Concession Factory Inspection Agreement to fail. Those with ambitions are again</p>
<p>encouraging smuggling in North China</p>
<p>causing our industry and commerce to be on the verge of bankruptcy, workers' unemployment is increasing day by day, and life is becoming increasingly precarious. Our country's workers are oppressed by this cruel environment at home and have no recourse to appeal. Abroad, they are subjected to unequal treatment and are exiled back to the country one after another. We believe that this situation has long been understood by your association. Because your association aims to avoid war, establish international peace, resist imperialism and capitalism, and abolish the aggression suffered by workers in Asian countries under foreign influence, we deeply hope that your association will use democratic and recognized trade union methods to seek to carry out these goals. If, like the International Federation of Trade Unions and other international organizations that sympathize with labor, we can adopt the same policies and methods to promote justice for the loud appeals of the invaded, so as to promote social equity and</p>
<p>maintain world peace</p>
<p>then the unprecedented crisis in East Asia can be gradually resolved. If this is the case, not only can the goals that your association has embraced be fully realized, but the Asian labor front will also be increasingly consolidated. At that time, our association will not wait to be invited to participate and will naturally follow from the ground up, so as to promote the infinite welfare of Asian trade unions and workers. We have responded accordingly to the previous letter. We hope that you will review and provide clarification. Sincerely, the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to the Asian Labor Conference."</p>

<h3>Japanese - Textile Factory Workers Endured the Pain and Resumed Work - The Government Will Properly Mediate Some of the Conditions - Workers at the Second Factory of the Public University Resumed Work Last Night - The Sixth Factory of the Shanghai West Inner and Outer Cotton Textile Factory Struck Again</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that all male and female workers of the Japanese-owned Shanghai and other textile factories in the Pudong area, after being persuaded by party and government agencies, endured the pain and resumed work in yesterday's day and night shifts. In the Shanghai West area, labor disputes occurred at the Japanese-owned Nei Wai Cotton, Xihe, and other textile factories. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Pudong Area - Resumption of Work Yesterday</p>
<p>At 5:30 AM yesterday morning, the Japanese-owned textile factories that had been on strike sounded the siren for Japanese workers to start work, and sent foremen and cooks to the workshops and workers' residences to coerce workers to enter the factory and resume work through intimidation and enticement. Fearing that disturbances would occur when workers resumed work, the factory notified the Yulin Road and Geland Road police stations and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to patrol the area in advance to prevent them. Detectives were also stationed inside the factory. When the Japanese workers left work, most of the night workers were unwilling to go to work. After being earnestly persuaded by personnel sent by the Municipal Party Department, the Social Bureau, and the General Labor Union, they all resumed work. When the workers went to work, they were in groups of three or five. Some of the female workers were in tears, and some were pounding their chests and sighing, and the situation was very miserable.</p>
<p>Number of People Surveyed</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reporter went to various factories to investigate the number of workers who had resumed work. It was found that only 70% to 80% had resumed work. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Conditional Issues</p>
<p>Regarding the five requirements jointly proposed by the workers, the personnel department director of the Shanghai Spinning and Weaving Co., Ltd., Makino Naka, told the Dagong News Agency reporter yesterday that the factory had accepted the increase of 5% in wages and improved the working conditions for workers. As for other conditions, such as awards, they would try to improve them when the factory's situation improved in the future. According to the worker representatives of the factory, after the joint strike of the workers in various factories, they originally hoped that the factory would give a satisfactory answer to the conditions proposed by all the workers. Unexpectedly, things went against their wishes and they could not achieve their goals. Under the pressure of life, the workers had to endure the pain and resume work, but they hoped that the government authorities would plan for a proper solution to the conditions proposed by the workers.</p>
<p>Call for Interrogation</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau summoned workers' representatives from various Japanese-owned textile factories at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Fifteen workers' representatives attended, and the director of the mediation section, Wang Xianqing, personally inquired the workers' representatives one by one. Because the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China was scheduled to respond to the workers' five conditions yesterday morning, the Japanese side still had no news to the Bureau by 12:00 noon, so there was no way to discuss it. However, the Bureau informed the representatives of the factories and persuaded the workers to wait quietly for mediation. The representatives returned at 0:30 AM.</p>
<p>Public University Resumes Work</p>
<p>The second factory of the Japanese-owned Public University Textile Factory in Badaitou, Yangshupu, has resumed work after all workers responded to the strike on the morning of the 12th. At 6:00 PM last night, the factory dispatched staff and foremen to notify the night shift male and female workers to enter the factory. The personnel department director, Kawase, gave a speech in the open space in front of the factory workshop for half an hour, allowing the workers to increase their wages by 5%, so the night shift workers resumed work uniformly at 7:35 PM.</p>
<p>Shanghai West Area - The Sixth Factory of Nei Wai Cotton Struck</p>
<p>The entire workforce of more than 800 male and female workers at the Sixth Factory of Nei Wai Cotton on Yichang Road in Shanghai West went on strike on the night shift of the 12th because a female worker in the yarn room was beaten by the Japanese supervisor, which led to the departure of all the male and female workers from the factory and a strike. Then, the workers also proposed four conditions, including increasing wages. The factory workshop manager, Nakano Kayohei, asked the general foreman, Katsuta, for instructions, but there was no response, causing all the workers to continue the strike yesterday. In addition, the Eighth Factory of Nei Wai Cotton on Gordon Road also experienced a go-slow strike due to the dismissal of workers, and the dispute has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>The Xihe Textile Factory - Also Proposes Conditions</p>
<p>All workers in the First, Second, and Third Factories of the Japanese-owned Xihe Textile Factory on Robertson Road have jointly proposed six conditions, including wage increases, weekly promotions, and monthly awards (the content of which is the same as in the Pudong area), and requested them from the factory. The factory has not yet responded, and the workers' emotions are agitated. It is not known whether a labor dispute can be avoided.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry Developing - Yangtze River Shallow Water Worrisome - Changsha Water Level Drops to One Foot - Freight Rates Rise by 125% - Salt and Coal Transportation Obstructed</h3>
<p>Recently, the Yangtze River has seen more exports than imports, and transfers to Hunan Province are even more crowded. However, the Xiang River's water level has dropped sharply, causing a recent telegram from Changsha to state that only one foot of water remains above the Lulin Pond. Ships traveling from Shanghai to Hunan can only reach Yuezhou and then have to transfer cargo. The freight rate for this route has already risen by 75% at the Six Companies. Now, because Dongting Lake cannot be navigated by wheels and the waterway is completely cut off, only civilian boats and shallow barges can barely sail. Therefore, the Six Companies continued to discuss and increased the shallow water fee by 50%, bringing the total increase to 125%. Since the beginning of Changsha shipping, the magnitude of the freight rate has been unprecedented. In the past few decades, the highest freight rate only increased by 80%. The shallowest point in the Jiujiang area is 13 feet 6 inches. All seagoing vessels with a draft of more than 14 feet are difficult to pass through. The seagoing vessels transporting salt from Haizhou have a draft of at least 17 feet and will now be blocked. Kangshou Company's Chang'an wheel telegraphed yesterday that it was stranded on the river surface four miles below Wuxue while loading coal from Tongzibao to Shanghai. The company sent an empty wheel Ruikang in Han to rescue, but the wheel has a draft of 18 feet and could not go. They had to send a barge to unload the cargo before trying to rescue it.</p>
<p>Shallow Water Difficult to Navigate</p>
<p>This has caused the salt freight rate to rise from 4 yuan 7 corners to 7 yuan 5 corners, and the coal ton price to rise from 2 yuan 2 corners to 3 yuan 5 corners, but there are still no ships to load. In past years, the Yangtze River's water level has consistently dropped between January and early April, called the dry season. This year, however, the water level has already dropped to a point where navigation is difficult in October. According to observations in the shipping industry, during the dry season in December and January in the future, the water level is likely to drop to the starting point of the current water level gauge. At that time, none of the Shanghai Six Companies wheels will be able to navigate. The general Hakka community is also very worried and is discussing changing to</p>
<p>Railway Transfer</p>
<p>The method is to transfer the downstream cargo from the Pinghan Railway to the Longhai Railway and take the sea route to Shanghai. The upstream cargo from Shanghai is loaded onto the Lianyungang and transferred to the Longhai Railway to connect with the Pinghan train. This way, cargo transportation will not be interrupted, but the freight rate will be higher. As for the Xiaochang River (i.e., the Shanghai section of the Tongyang River), this year, due to the abundant harvests of miscellaneous grains and cotton in the areas north of the Yangtze River, there is a lot of stockpiling waiting to be loaded onto Shanghai. This route was originally traveled by ships of the Dada and Datong companies. Now, due to the crowding of cargo, the original eight wheels are insufficient to supply the demand. It is said that the two companies have agreed to increase the number of flights and expand the transportation capacity. They have already leased the Yongan wheel of the Dazhen Shipping Company and the Tianshi wheel of the Chongming Shipping Company to join the route. It is expected that additional flights will be added on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>Wang Jun’s Family in Shanghai, Yesterday Departed for Shaanxi for Funeral; Wang Left Behind Three Sons and One Daughter; Wang Has an Elderly Mother Currently in Yunnan</h3>
<p>Wang Jun, the army commander of the Central Third Army, recently led his troops in suppressing communist bandits in eastern Gansu. On the ninth, while taking the opportunity of a lull in the fighting to inspect the front lines, his plane crashed and burned, resulting in his death. Mr. Wang's family resides in Shanghai. The Shenzhou News Agency reporter visited Wang's residence at Lane 1136, Yuyuan Road, yesterday to inquire. According to his family, the news of Mr. Wang's accident in the line of duty was only relayed by the Nanjing Third Army Office on the eleventh. At that time, it was only stated that the plane had crashed, and the true details were unknown. Yesterday morning, a long-distance phone call from the capital confirmed Mr. Wang's death in eastern Gansu. Mrs. Xia, Mr. Wang's wife, was deeply saddened upon hearing the news. She immediately departed for Beijing by car at 1 p.m. yesterday, accompanied by several other family members, to meet with Director Shi of the Third Army's Beijing Office and proceed to Shaanxi for the funeral. Mr. Wang left behind three sons and one daughter. All three sons are studying in Beijing, and the daughter is in Shanghai. She has already accompanied Mrs. Wang to Shaanxi and will proceed to Pingliang to handle the funeral arrangements. Mr. Wang has an elderly mother currently in Yunnan. Mr. Wang's father passed away early. It is also learned that when Mr. Wang's plane crashed, two pilots also perished at the same time, making a total of three casualties including Mr. Wang.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Industry in Guangdong Requests Assistance from Peers</h3>
<p>Su Dingchuan, Wu Yuqiang, representatives of the tobacco leaf industry in Guangdong Province, Fang Yuwan, representative of the tobacco silk industry, and Lu Yinong, representative of tobacco farmers, arrived in Shanghai from Guangdong yesterday. They are scheduled to go to Beijing immediately to petition for the abolition of the tobacco monopoly in the province. Yesterday, the representatives brought official letters to the Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association, requesting assistance. They were received by Secretary Liu. It is reported that the association believes that the Guangdong tobacco monopoly not only harms tobacco farmers and merchants in Guangdong Province, but also affects the business of Shanghai tobacco merchants. They sympathize greatly with the Guangdong representatives' request to abolish the monopoly and are willing to provide all possible assistance.</p>
<h3>Commercial Art Writers Association Holds Annual Meeting in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Chinese Commercial Art Writers Association was founded and organized by domestic commercial artists Ye Jianxiu, Wang Shouren, Wang Yichang, Xu Minzhi, Cheng Keguang, and others. Its main purpose is to connect commercial art writers across the country and revive the national industrial and commercial sectors. With the support of board members Pan Gongzhan, Wang Xiaolai, Zai Yachen, Lei Guiyuan, and Du Jinsheng, the association's affairs are developing rapidly. It currently has 200 members, with branches widely distributed in Beijing, Ping, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Ningbo, Guangzhou, Qingdao, Wuhan, and other places. Recently, the 13th joint meeting of directors and supervisors decided to hold the second annual meeting in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. At that time, experts from all over the country will gather in Shanghai, which will make a significant contribution to the improvement of Chinese industrial and commercial art and the revival of industrial and commercial enterprises in the future.</p>
<h3>This City Actively Promoting Anti-Drug Propaganda Work; Citywide Performers Assist in Propaganda; Many Turn Themselves in and Seek Rehabilitation in Recent Days</h3>
<p>The anti-drug propaganda campaign organized by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, Garrison Headquarters, Anti-Smoking Committee, Public Security Bureau, and other agencies opened on the tenth. The details were reported in this newspaper earlier. It is now known that all parties are actively promoting the propaganda work in recent days. The Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday specially instructed the Municipal Entertainment Association to instruct its performers to use their work in radio stations or entertainment venues to promote anti-drug messages, explaining the government's determination to ban drugs and the severity of the ban. Starting from New Year's Day next year, those who violate the anti-drug regulations will be sentenced to death, so that the audience will correct their mistakes if they have any and guard against them if they do not, and assist in the propaganda to achieve significant results. Police officers in each district have been divided into groups to go out to officially promote investigation and crackdown. According to Director Ye of the Fourth Section of the Public Security Bureau, many drug offenders have turned themselves in to the Public Security Bureau and sought rehabilitation in recent days. During this propaganda campaign, it is hoped that those who traffic or consume drugs will quickly wake up and strive for self-renewal, which will bring boundless happiness to the future of the nation and its people.</p>

<h3>Qian Junrui Returned to China Yesterday to Promote the Peace Movement</h3>
<p>Qian Junrui, who went abroad to investigate the European economy and attend the World Peace Congress in Brussels, returned to China on the French postal ship Fèlix Roussel. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday. According to Mr. Qian, he originally intended to go to the United States from Europe to continue his investigation, but he was entrusted by Sir Cecil, the president of the World Peace Congress, and Mr. Guthe (French Minister of Aviation) to return to China urgently to promote the peace movement. He planned to report on the proceedings of the congress and its development plan, so he immediately changed his itinerary and returned to his motherland. Mr. Qian also said that more and more leaders from all walks of life in China are supporting the world peace movement. Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Xi, Finance Minister Kong, Vice Chairman Feng and his wife, and Mayor Wu of this city have all responded to the call of Sir Cecil and Mr. Benes (President of Czechoslovakia) to join the World Peace Congress. Therefore, the leaders of the congress are very impressed with the enthusiasm of the Chinese people for the peace movement. After arriving in Shanghai, Mr. Qian plans to visit dignitaries in Beijing and Shanghai to convey Sir Cecil's gratitude and discuss concrete ways to promote the peace movement in China.</p>
<h3>Huang Fu’s Condition Unchanged</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Fu, who is ill in the Hong En Hospital, has benefited greatly in health after General Fan Shisheng twice used Chinese medicine to drain the accumulated water from his abdomen. However, this is only a palliative treatment, and the root cause has not been eliminated. There has been no significant progress in his condition in recent days, but there has also been no deterioration. Rumors that Mr. Huang's condition has worsened are not accurate.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance to Request Reduction in Price of Henan Sulphur</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a cable to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, which reads: "To the esteemed Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: On the eleventh of this month, we received a letter from Dazhong Dyeing Co., Ltd., stating that sulphur is one of the main raw materials of our factory. Since the government ordered the use of sulphur produced in Henan, we have repeatedly contacted the Henan Nitrate and Sulphur Bureau. Initially, we had to give up because the sulphur was not suitable for dye production. Later, after the Henan sulphur was refined, samples were sent, and after testing, it seemed to be usable. However, the price was too high, exceeding the ordinary market price by more than 60%. With such a large disparity, it is difficult to approach. Although we have repeatedly requested the bureau to refer to the current market price and make a reasonable adjustment, the Henan sulphur clearly knows this but refuses to reduce the price due to cost considerations. However, the government has ordered the use of Henan sulphur, and we must comply with the order, but we cannot help but speak out. The government's promotion of the state-run sulphur business is not something we dare to criticize. However, on the one hand, the Henan sulphur refuses to set prices based on market conditions, and on the other hand, our factory cannot but comply with the order to use Henan sulphur. Under these circumstances, we can only abandon the principal and seek the secondary. We appeal to the government to waive the freight charges for the Henan sulphur as a remedy. (Omission) Our dyeing industry is in the trial stage, with our factory being the earliest, and our products having only three or four years of history. Among all the companies in the industry, including Zhongfu, Huaan, and our factory, Zhongfu, the largest in terms of capital, has collapsed repeatedly due to the pressure of foreign goods and has finally ceased operations. Our factory and Huaan are still struggling to survive, and the difficulty of the current situation is self-evident. The sales volume of domestic dyes on the market is less than one-tenth of that of foreign goods, which is inversely proportional to the sales of matches. However, foreign merchants still regret that we have not been defeated, and Japanese merchants are actively setting up factories to manufacture dyes in Shanghai. According to current investigations, there are already three factories producing dyes. These three Japanese factories certainly need to use sulphur, but it is a fact that they have not purchased Henan sulphur to date. In contrast, if our factory bears the special price of Henan sulphur and cannot compete with Japanese goods, it will be even more obvious. We have investigated and found that Henan sulphur is a domestic product, and it is our duty to promote its purchase. However, the price is 60% higher than the market price, causing our factories to lose as much as 10,000 yuan per year in raw materials. This is tantamount to the state-run nitrate factory forcing contributions, which is not in line with trade norms. If a loss of 10,000 yuan is not significant, now that one of the three Chinese factories has closed, and the three factories set up by foreign merchants in Shanghai are not subject to mandatory use of Henan nitrates, the cost of raw materials is the key to the survival of manufacturers. This request for price reduction is an urgent appeal for self-help, not a petty calculation. As for the situation of match factories, because domestic factories have decades of history and a solid foundation, they cannot be compared with dye factories, as the factory's original text has stated, without the need for further elaboration. Based on the above reasons, we should cable your ministry to request a review and approval, and order the Kaifeng Nitrate and Sulphur Refinery in Henan to sell at the same price, in order to achieve a win-win situation for both people and ourselves. Otherwise, if these factories become the successors of Zhongfu, Henan nitrates may not benefit from trade either. It is important to plan comprehensively, pay attention to near-term interests, and turn them into a disservice. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully submits this."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to French Municipal Council to Improve Production of Vehicle Licenses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council, which reads: "To the esteemed Council: On the eleventh of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal Rickshaw Industry Association, stating that the rickshaw licenses in the French Concession have always been made by prisoners. The procedures for pasting and oiling are completely perfunctory, resulting in the paper and lead sheet of the license being broken and torn apart within a few days after the rickshaw merchant pays the business tax, and then peeling off completely. The rickshaw merchant then writes the original number on it, but the patrol often refers to it as confused business, and pries off the license, causing the rickshaw merchant and rickshaw puller to suffer unexpected losses innocently. If the license is pried off for other reasons, the license paper is lost, and the rickshaw puller cannot redeem it with a good piece of paper, so he has to stop business and wait, and the loss is even more unbearable. In addition, the Revenue Office requires the rickshaw merchant to submit the old license every month. For licenses with only the lead sheet left, the revenue office will not issue a donation certificate and will stop issuing licenses unless the association proves it and replenishes the lead. This is not the fault of the rickshaw merchant, but the rickshaw merchant has suffered losses again and again. The association has sent a letter to the Electricity Bureau requesting improvement, but no improvement has been seen. For this reason, we have poured out our feelings, and we urge your council to send a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council to promptly find a way to improve the production of the rickshaw licenses, so that the rickshaw merchant's expenses can be used for business for one month, and not suffer other losses due to the peeling off of the license paper. Before a solution is found, please stop withholding licenses and submitting old licenses. Although this is a trivial loss, it has a great impact on the rickshaw industry. We urge you to strive for rectification in order to live up to the expectations of the industry and maintain commercial prosperity. The association has investigated and found that the license paper is pasted on the lead sheet, which is easy to break and cannot be used for one month of business. If the patrol sees the number and the handwriting is slightly ambiguous, they will pry off the license. When going to redeem the license, there are also difficulties and additional fees, which is very obstructive to the rickshaw puller's business and should be improved. It is necessary to improve it. We should inform your office to promptly instruct the Vehicle Affairs Office to properly improve the various points mentioned in the letter. We hope to hear from you soon."</p>
<h3>All Circles Implement One-Day Movement</h3>
<p>The Memorial Committee for Purchasing Aircraft in this city yesterday continued to receive donations from all circles and groups in support of the One-Day Movement for Purchasing Aircraft to Save the Country and Wishing Longevity to the Leader. These included: 34.4 yuan donated by all male and female workers of the Shaoxing Silk Factory, collected by the Zhejiang General Labor Union; 4.15 yuan from the Xu Fuji Company; 6 yuan from the Private Zhengxiu First Elementary School; 100 yuan from the Jiangsu Shovel Industry Association collected by Mr. He Qichang; 69.1 yuan from the entire Chinese teaching staff of the Shanghai Women's Medical College and Shanghai Ximen Women and Children's Hospital; 10 yuan from Xiang Yuancun; and 10 yuan transferred by the Yangzi Watch Company from Ge Yuee and Jiang Pingshi, two seven-year-old elementary school students in Ningbo, who donated their accumulated pocket money. Receipts and thank-you letters were issued for all donations.</p>
<p>The National Flag Manufacturing and Sales Bureau donated 1,000 national flags of various sizes to be sold by the Memorial Committee for Purchasing Aircraft, with the proceeds to be used for donations to purchase aircraft and wish longevity to the leader. Since the start of the sale, all circles, groups, and businesses in this city have shown their support for the aviation salvation movement and love for the leader. Purchases have been very enthusiastic in recent days, and there are not many left. Those who still want to purchase them are requested to purchase them from the Youth Association at 311 Baxianqiao as soon as possible, which is also a way to support the aviation salvation movement and wish longevity. Everyone is participating in this grand event.</p>
<h3>China Foreign Famine Relief Commission Allocates 4,000 Yuan to Relieve Disease-Stricken People in Shandong Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>According to a report by Director Lu Bohong of the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission at 9-7 Renji Road, he recently received a letter from Vice Bishop Ai in Jinan, stating that the disaster relief hospital in the area has always been unable to close due to the presence of seriously ill disaster victims, and that the funds are tight, requesting relief. The Commission has investigated and found that the hospital has had very good results in the past, having saved many people. Considering the suffering of the disaster victims who are hungry and cold, it is already very pitiful, and it is even more unbearable to see them suffering from serious illnesses. Therefore, the original letter is attached, hoping that you will allocate funds for relief. A letter from Mr. Jui Ai (German) is attached, stating that the Yellow River disaster last year affected almost all of western Shandong, and the number of disaster victims was countless. The sound of hunger and cold was unbearable to hear. Fortunately, with the strong support and generous relief of your Commission, the people of western Shandong have what they have today. Thinking of this, I am very grateful. The Jinan Ganshiqiao Disaster Relief Hospital was also founded by your organization. It should have been closed long ago to clear the accounts, but unfortunately, a group of disaster victims are seriously ill and have not been able to leave the hospital. The municipal government has also sent a large number of patients. Unfortunately, the funds of this parish come from Germany, but due to the economic blockade implemented in Germany, the economy is becoming increasingly panicked, and the funds are also very tight. We should report to your Commission and redouble our efforts. The Commission also received letters from the Shandong Wilderness Yellow River Disaster Relief Association, the Universal Morality Society, the County Chamber of Commerce, the Education Association, and the Yuncheng Disaster Relief Association and Red Swastika Society, County Chamber of Commerce, etc., with roughly the same content. In addition to having previously allocated 13,000 yuan for emergency relief, 22,000 yuan for industrial relief, and 30,000 yuan for agricultural relief to Shandong Province, which have been completed, the Commission also resolved at a meeting yesterday to allocate another 4,000 yuan, with 2,000 yuan to Jinan and 2,000 yuan to western Shandong, to relieve disease-stricken people in the disaster area.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Rotary Club Issues Hospital Lottery Tickets to Raise Funds to Build Children's Convalescent Hospital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rotary Club has always been committed to serving the society and running various charitable undertakings. It is extremely concerned about the poor children in this city. For example, the summer outings and entertainment for poor children and the distribution of toys to poor children during the Christmas season in winter are all collected from various Chinese and Western elementary schools and specially repaired. In recent years, a total of more than 26,000 pieces have been donated. The poor children who receive the donations are mostly between the ages of eight and eighteen.

<h3>Silver Prices Gradually Stabilizing; Equalization Tax Rate Reduced</h3>

It is now learned that the committee believes that world silver prices have stabilized, so yesterday the Central Bank of China's listed equalization tax rate has been reduced to 9.5%, which has restored the original tax rate of 10 days ago.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Reiterates Crackdown on Disguised Escort Agencies; Establishing Names to Harm Society; Deadline for Dissolution or Severe Punishment</h3>
<p>Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, previously issued a public notice banning escort agencies in this city because they were related to local morals and customs, and prohibited them from publishing advertisements in newspapers. However, it did not take long for all escort agencies to change their names one after another and still try to exist. Director Pan of the Bureau has once again banned them in order to rectify public morals. A public notice was issued yesterday, stating: "Recently, escort agencies in this city have been established everywhere. After careful investigation, most of them are using names as a pretext to carry out seduction. After this Bureau banned newspapers from publishing their advertisements, there were also disguised organizations such as dance partner agencies, tour guide agencies, and service agencies. Such clever establishment of names to harm society, if not strictly prohibited, how can we maintain morals and maintain law and order? Therefore, this special public notice is given to all, urging all escort agencies and various disguised organizations to dissolve within a deadline. If they still act contrary to the ban, they will be severely punished according to law."</p>

<h3>Health Department Declares No Plague in the Concession</h3>
<p>A recent report stated that the plague had recently occurred in the Public Concession of Shanghai, with several casualties among residents. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department has organized plague prevention teams in various districts within the Concession to prevent its spread and engage in catching rodents, etc. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Council's Health Department, the above report is completely inaccurate and believes that such rumors can easily cause panic among residents and disrupt public order within the Concession, so it is necessary to correct it. The responsible person added that the Public Concession has not had any plague cases in recent decades, and the Health Department's epidemic prevention team is actually an old organization that specializes in assisting residents in searching and catching rodents in various parts of the Concession. In addition, whenever dead rats are found, they are sent to the Municipal Council's laboratory for testing to check the possibility of the plague's existence. In the future, if residents in the Concession encounter matters related to public health, they can inquire with the Health Department at any time, so that the truth can be easily understood, and the public will not be alarmed by false rumors.</p>

<h3>Gao Yongxing Velvet Weaving Factory Fire Yesterday Morning Claims Seven Lives, Caused by Electric Motor Igniting Fluff During Napping Process, Same Type of Fire Has Occurred Three Times in the Past Year, Social Affairs Bureau and Municipal Council Send Personnel for Detailed Investigation</h3>
<p>The Gao Yongxing Velvet Weaving Factory at No. 13, Alley 172, Ala Baisituo Road, North Zhejiang Road, suddenly caught fire at 1 a.m. yesterday morning, burning seven workers to death. The Factory Inspection Office of the Third Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Factory Section of the Public Concession Municipal Council have sent personnel to investigate in detail. The estimated loss is 50,000 yuan. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Spreading to Neighbors</p>
<p>The Gao Yongxing Velvet Weaving Factory suddenly caught fire at 1 a.m. yesterday morning. The night shift was still in progress, and seven day-shift workers were sleeping in the building. The building was an old-style shop with several looms and napping machines inside. Of the seven people sleeping in the building, four were sleeping on the upper floor of the combing machine, and the remaining three were sleeping in the rear room downstairs. After the fire broke out, the four people upstairs could not escape while sleeping and were all burned to death. Of the three downstairs, two were burned to death. One of them, after escaping, went back into the fire and suddenly collapsed and died. Fortunately, the West District Fire Brigade dispatched vehicles to put out the fire and, together with the factory's shift workers, made every effort to extinguish it. However, because the fire was too fierce, it spread to the Tongjihe Wine Shop at No. 11 and a certain surname's residence at No. 9. It was not completely extinguished until about 10 a.m. However, Nos. 13 and 15, the factory, were completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Seven Lives Lost</p>
<p>After the incident, the West District Fire Brigade found the bodies of seven day-shift workers burned to death in the rubble. A letter was sent to the coroner's office. The names of the people burned to death are as follows: (1) Zhao Zhixiang, 42 years old; (2) Shao Longgen, 30 years old; (3) Zhang Shunji, 22 years old; (4) Qian Liansheng, 27 years old; (5) Yang Lisheng, 23 years old; (6) Shao Fugeng, 28 years old; (7) Zhou Amao, 40 years old. The factory's loss is estimated at 50,000 yuan. As for the losses of the neighboring Tongjihe Wine Shop and a certain surname's residence, they are not included.</p>
<p>Cause of the Fire</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Factory Section of the Public Concession Municipal Council immediately sent personnel to the factory to investigate the cause and process of the fire in detail. According to the information released by the Information Office, the Factory Section personnel of the Municipal Council investigated the workers at the scene afterward and learned that the fire was caused by the fluff on the electric motor being ignited by electricity. Because the combing machine emits fine fluff when combing the wool, it flies onto the electric motor and is easily burned. It was also found that the same type of fire had occurred three times in the past year, but fortunately, there were no loss of life. Therefore, the Factory Section of the Municipal Council has paid special attention to this matter and recently went to 15 weaving factories to investigate. Gao Yongxing Factory had been inspected once on October 9. At that time, the factory's air circulation was considered good, and the wool could be extracted at any time during the combing process, so it would not fly into the workshop. The other six factories did not have such equipment. Since then, only one factory has installed this complete equipment in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<p>Authorities Investigate</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Factory Inspection Office of the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau immediately sent factory inspectors Tian Heqing and others to the scene to investigate in detail. It is reported that the factory employs more than 120 workers, working in two shifts, day and night. When the fire broke out yesterday morning, the day-shift workers had all left the factory, and the night-shift workers, about 50 people, were working and immediately escaped to the outside of the factory. However, the seven day-shift foremen, because they lived in the factory, were awakened in their sleep and could not escape, resulting in a tragic death by fire.</p>
<h3>Pudong Waterworks Expected to Supply Water by Year-End</h3>
<p>The Pudong Waterworks is being organized by the Shanghai Industrial Trust Society on behalf of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Since construction began last year, it has been more than a year. Yesterday, a reporter visited the person in charge of the Industrial Trust Society to inquire about the progress of the waterworks project. According to him, the various civil engineering works of the waterworks can be completed within the year. The internal machinery is currently being installed, and the pipeline laying project has also been 80 to 90 percent completed. The water supply is expected to start by the end of this year to meet local needs. Yesterday (the 13th), a report stated that the Pudong Waterworks would have to start construction next year, which is actually a misrepresentation.</p>
<h3>Settlement Plan Agreed for the July-August Cotton Flower Dispute, Brokerage Association Subsidizes 190,000 Yuan, Exchange Assists with 230,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Shenzhou News Agency reports that the Futures Exchange was previously a bull company organized by financial securities and other giants, with daily transactions exceeding one million. At that time, the total number of cotton flowers held reached a huge 17 to 18 million. Therefore, the cotton market rose higher and higher, but the current sales of yarn were sluggish, and the price of yarn fell miserably every day, causing difficulties for all factories. At the same time, the officials of the Futures Exchange believed that this speculative transaction would create great danger, so they stopped new transactions in accordance with the Exchange Law and could only settle transactions, resulting in huge losses of several million yuan for the company. They had no choice but to refuse delivery on the grounds of poor cotton quality. The losses suffered by the 13 agent brokers were therefore very large. Now, the board of directors of the Exchange and the Brokerage Association jointly bear the losses of the bull company and the 13 brokers. However, the board of directors of the Exchange is tight-lipped about the amount of compensation for the losses of the bull company. According to rumors in the industry, it is around 500,000 yuan and has already been allocated by the board of directors under special expenses. As for the losses of the 13 brokers, a proper solution has been reached, and all brokers are notified to comply. The bull company case of the number of disputes has come to an end. The announcement is recorded as follows: Announcement of the Futures Exchange Brokerage Association: Regarding the cotton flower dispute in July and August of this year, 15 members previously sent letters requesting a special meeting of all members to discuss solutions. On September 4, at 4:00 p.m., the association held a meeting of all members and elected Chairman Wu Kouqing, Vice Chairman Shao Wenmei, Vice Chairman Zhou Shaokang, Member Zhou Zixing, and Member Qian Hejin and five gentlemen represented by Sun Yufeng as representatives of the association to discuss methods with the Exchange to handle the case jointly. After the above five gentlemen represented the association and negotiated repeatedly with the Exchange, there was no other appropriate solution except for the following methods. The methods agreed upon by the representatives of the association and Ling Yisuo are listed below: (1) All members of the association will subsidize 190,000 yuan in national currency to the 13 members including Hexing, Jinchang, Taichang, Yichang, Runkang, Fengtai, Changfeng, Rongji, Shenji, Yuda Tongji, Senkang, Hu Meiji, and Mingde. This amount will be borrowed first by the association from the Exchange without interest. The method of repayment is that all members of the association and their successors will pay an additional subsidy of 2.5 cents per hundred from the new cotton flower transactions starting on December 1 of this year. Half will be paid if not paid in advance. Both will be collected by one party. The Exchange will collect it daily until 175,000 yuan is collected. The remaining 15,000 yuan will be paid by the association from the fund when the Exchange collects 175,000 yuan. (2) In addition to the aforementioned 190,000 yuan, the representatives of the association will also send a letter to the Exchange on behalf of all members, asking them to take into account the difficulties of the aforementioned 13 members and provide another 230,000 yuan in national currency to help them maintain their operations. (3) Regarding the 190,000 yuan in national currency borrowed from the Exchange, five representatives jointly elected by all members of the association should sign two copies of the agreement separately with the Exchange, each holding one copy as evidence. The above methods have been agreed upon by the representatives of the association and the Exchange and are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Ji Yunqi Dies from Eating Pufferfish</h3>
<p>Ji Yunqi, a 49-year-old man from Nantong, was the accountant at the Jiecheng Rickshaw Company at the intersection of Dong Youheng Road and Xinji Bang Road.

He was taken to Tongren Hospital but died after unsuccessful treatment. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>"Hindering Family" Case with Conflicting Accounts Opens, Xi Fengda Absent Due to Illness, Hu Zhuoxing and Daughter Surrender, Father-in-Law Produces Engagement Evidence</h3>
<p>Xi Fengkui, a 47-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 70, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, formerly employed at Kong Shi Foreign Firm, has a son and a daughter. His son, Jiazheng, 18 years old, is an apprentice at Senlin Industrial Company. His daughter, Yexian, 19 years old, did not return home on the first of this month. Xi, suffering from a skin disease and unable to move, sent his son Jiazheng to search for her. He learned that Yexian had been accompanied to Sino-American Hospital on Peile Road by his friend Hu Zhuoxing (also known as Xiang, 26 years old, secretary at the Cork Industry Association), through the wife of Wu Zangfu at No. 6, Erqing Lane, Ximen Road, for treatment for a pregnancy. It was with Hu she was having an affair and was pregnant. Xi then ordered his son Jiazheng to report to the French police station, accusing Hu of hindering the family. The detectives were dispatched to Hu's residence at No. 44, Hengchang Lane, Peile Road, to interrogate Hu. Hu claimed that Xi had promised his daughter to him as his wife and they had cohabitated before the engagement. The police chief transferred the case to the Second Special District Court because both parties held conflicting accounts. Court President Wang Wangxu previously presided over the preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court, but the plaintiff and defendant were not present, so the hearing was rescheduled, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Court President Wang presided over the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. The plaintiff, Xi Fengkui, was absent from the hospital due to illness. Only the defendant, Hu Zhuoxing, and Xi's daughter, Yexian, were present. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi prosecuted according to Article 240, Paragraph 3, of the Criminal Law, for enticement. According to Hu's testimony, he had originally intended to go through the engagement formalities with Xi's daughter, but their finances were insufficient, and his father-in-law allowed them to cohabitate first. He covered all their household expenses. From March to the end of August or early September, his salary was not enough to support his in-laws' household and medical expenses, which led to disagreements. So, he stayed at his friend Chen Qi's place at the dead body number of Hengchang Lane, Peile Road. Now, the father-in-law has written a letter allowing the engagement to take place within a week and has submitted the evidence. Subsequently, Xi Yexian testified that she cohabitated with Hu under her parents' orders, and her testimony was the same as Hu's. The court investigated and ruled to reschedule the hearing for the 19th because the plaintiff was not present. Hu Zhuoxing was ordered to be escorted by Chen Qi, who would be responsible for his attendance.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun and Others Initiate Public Burial for Martyr Qian Gang, All Sectors in Wujiang Have Formed a Preparatory Committee, Discussing Naming a "Digen Road" in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Revolutionary martyr Qian Gang (Digen) was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Jiangsu National Revolutionary Army in Shanghai, engaged in secret work when the Northern Expeditionary Army had not yet arrived in Shanghai in 1927. On the 16th of that month, he was arrested by Li Baozhang, subordinate of Sun Chuanfang, and martyred in Longhua. At that time, Qian's family escorted the remains back to their native Wujiang and temporarily placed them in the Reception Temple. More than nine years have passed since then, and he has not yet been buried. Court President Ju Zheng, Foreign Minister Zhang Qun, Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Education Director Pan Gongzhan, Garrison Headquarters Military Law Office Director Lu Jingshi, Central Committee Member Li Liejun, Liu Yazi, Xue Dubi, Chu Minyi, and others had petitioned the National Government in 1920 to provide a public burial for Qian to comfort his spirit. Because the public burial regulations had not yet been promulgated that year, it was inconvenient to hold one. Now, it is learned that Li Liejun and others have revived the previous proposal to request an allocation of funds and arrange a public burial for Qian. At the same time, all sectors in Wujiang County are preparing to hold a grand tenth anniversary commemoration of Qian Gang's martyrdom on January 16 next year, build a memorial monument, and have formed the Wujiang All Sectors Public Burial Qian Gang Martyr Preparatory Committee. Representatives Jin Luwang were also sent to Shanghai, carrying letters to visit Shanghai Mayor Wu, asking for a road in Shanghai to be named Digen Road in memory of his meritorious deeds.</p>
<h3>Mild Weather, Fog Yesterday Morning, Huangpu Tide Level Reduced Due to Shallow Water in the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai has recently returned to mild, unlike winter. At the same time, dense fog has occurred for several consecutive days, greatly affecting transportation. The Datong News Agency reporter reports the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Mild Weather</p>
<p>The lowest temperature in Shanghai had previously dropped to 36-37 degrees, quite chilly. However, since the day before yesterday, it has returned to mild, with the lowest temperature returning to 42-43 degrees, not at all like winter weather. At the same time, dense fog has been seen repeatedly. The fog was particularly heavy yesterday morning, greatly hindering transportation. Fortunately, the weather was clear, so the fog was temporary, gradually dissipating after sunrise.</p>
<p>Huangpu River Water Level</p>
<p>It was also learned from the Dredging Bureau that the tides in the Huangpu River have been lower than predicted recently, likely due to shallow water in the Yangtze River. At the same time, because the autumn flood tide period has passed this year, the highest high tide in the Huangpu River has reached 10 feet, slightly odd. It is still two or three feet lower than the Bund embankment, so it is not worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3>Man Commits Suicide at Wusong Beach Park</h3>
<p>A man's body was suddenly found hanging in Wusong Wai Ma Lu Beach Park yesterday morning. He was around 30 years old, wearing a blue cotton robe, citizen training pants, purple-grey socks, long double-beam shoes and a purple felt hat. Inside his pocket was an empty wallet and a sixth National Games commemorative medal with the words "Move Forward Vigorously." There were no other possessions. He looked like someone in the business community. It is unknown what prompted him to commit suicide. He had used a new white cloth as a rope, one end attached to the railing of the pavilion. Because the railing was low, his body was sitting on the ground, and the other end of the cloth was around his neck. His face looked alive, not frightening at all. However, there were a dozen drops of fresh blood flowing from his nostrils, dripping onto his clothes. After being discovered, the incident was reported to the Wusong Police Station, which sent personnel to investigate. Because the case was a suicide, the local guarantor Zhou Lansheng was ordered to report to the local court for examination.</p>

<h3>Amidst Strikes, Two Cases of Trouble Makers are Prosecuted, Female Teacher Arrested for Intentional Incitement, Liu Wanxing and Others Sentenced to Detention</h3>
<p>Amid the strike wave at Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, a resolution may be possible after several days of negotiations between labor and management. The afternoon before yesterday, Yangshupu Tongxing Yarn Factory posted notices outside the factory advising workers to resume work. The factory workers surrounded the bulletin, forming a wall. At that time, Chen Lifan, a woman from Zhenjiang and a teacher at the night school affiliated with a certain elementary school on Seward Road, told the gathered female workers that the notice did not mention wage increases and that they should not resume work. Her words were heard by a detective dispatched by the local police station to maintain order. Because Chen was not a female worker and should not make such inciting remarks, she was arrested. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the First Special District Local Court, where Magistrate Zhan Liangce conducted the interrogation. According to police lawyer Jiang Baolian, the police needed to continue to investigate Chen's actions and requested that she be detained temporarily pending further investigation. It was decided that the director of personnel affairs of Tongxing Yarn Factory, a Japanese man, and staff members would provide proof that they personally heard Chen advise the female workers to refrain from resuming work. Chen Lifan admitted to passing by the place and stopping to look at the notice, but denied having prevented them from resuming work. Her father appeared in court and requested that his daughter be released on bail. Magistrate Zhan ruled to postpone the hearing until next Monday and ordered that Chen Lifan be detained.</p>
<p>Workers at the Ewo Sack Factory on Weituoma Road have also recently had a dispute. At around 4 p.m. the day before yesterday, 135 workers, including Wang Zhongwu, went to work at the factory, but were blocked outside the factory by their fellow workers, including Liu Wanxing. After a standoff, only 25 were able to enter the factory. The factory reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which dispatched detective Li Changchao to suppress the situation. The dispute subsided, and Liu Wanxing, Liu Wande, and Wang Yi, who were considered to be the main instigators, were arrested. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Jiang Baolian sent the two Liu brothers and Wang to the First Special District Court and prosecuted them for obstructing freedom under Article 304 of the Criminal Law. He stated the course of events, but the defendants claimed that they were only fighting with Wang Zhongwu and others, presenting the head injuries of Liu Wande and Wang Yi as evidence. After Magistrate Zhan completed the investigation, he sentenced Liu Wanxing to 15 days of detention and Liu Wande and Wang Yi to 10 days of detention each as a warning.</p>

<h3>Dadong Pharmacy Falsifies and Counterfeits Branded Drugs, Police File Public Prosecution, Victims Also File Incidental Civil Lawsuit for Compensation, Whether the Medicine Contains Poisonous Substances Remains to be Tested</h3>
<p>Dadong Pharmacy at No. 300, Guangdong Road, opened by Gui Yaohua, Huang Fumo, etc., specializes in counterfeiting the products of other pharmacies, using counterfeit trademarks, and selling them in the market.

The court ordered the defendants to be detained pending a hearing next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>共匪李揚敬　移提市公安局　以便歸案訊辦</h3>
<p>The Communist bandit Li Yangjing, also known as Chen Guangming, a native of Yongkang, Zhejiang Province, 25 years old, committed murder and robbery in his hometown. He fled to Shanghai and was wanted by the Zhejiang authorities with a ten-order warrant. The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau was also informed to arrest him. Recently, detectives from the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with detectives from the political department of the French Concession Police, arrested Li near the Great World on Min Ti Ni Yin Road. After taking him to the police station, Li confessed that Yu Yongli, a fellow villager who was assigned to work as a secretary at the registration office by the Second Special Court, was his accomplice. After interrogation and arrest, Li was transferred to the Third Branch of the High Court for interrogation and detention. At the same time, the police station reported to the First Branch of the High Court, which secretly ordered the Second Special Court to keep Yu Yongli under surveillance. The Chief Prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court, Qiao Wanxuan, held a court hearing and ordered Yu and Li to be brought in for interrogation and confrontation. Yu flatly denied the charges. He was ordered to be detained pending further investigation. Li was sent back to the police station for continued detention. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, the Second Branch of the High Court ordered Li to be brought in to have his photo taken first. At four o'clock, the head of the Criminal Court, Wu Tingqi, accompanied by two judges, Wang and Liao, and the examining prosecutor Dong, attended the continuation of the trial in the Fifth Criminal Court.

It was reported that the trial concluded with the court ruling that because Li had committed crimes in Zhejiang Province, the defendant Li Yangjing, also known as Chen Guangming, should be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau for transfer back to Zhejiang for investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>捲欵潛逃　郁文朝被逮　交運公司未註冊　自訴案依法駁回</h3>
<p>Yu Wen Zhao arrested for absconding with funds. The transportation company was not registered. The private prosecution was legally dismissed.</p>
<p>The Jiaoyun Transportation Company at 26 Xingsheng Street, French Concession, was managed by Xu Shengfu (60 years old) from Suzhou, who was the general manager. When the company was established, Yu Wenchao (26 years old this year) from Shaoxing was accepted as an apprentice. Initially, Yu worked diligently and cautiously, progressing from apprentice to employee, and then promoted to officer, managing company affairs. Unexpectedly, on December 26 of last year, Yu secretly took the company's receipt book and successively collected accounts receivable from various customers, amounting to 7,575 yuan, and absconded with the funds. After the company discovered this, they reported to the French Concession Police to request an arrest and offered a reward of 400 yuan. Until the day before yesterday, Yu was recognized by an employee of the Jiaoyun Transportation Company at the Old North Gate, who turned him over to the police and brought him to the branch office. The French Concession Police sent detectives to transfer Yu to the station. Xu Shengfu of the Jiaoyun Transportation Company, entrusted lawyer Sun Zuji as his agent, and filed a private prosecution with the Second District Court based on Article 236 of the Criminal Law for occupational embezzlement, along with a related civil suit requesting a judgment to repay 7,535 yuan. According to the complaint, the court, yesterday morning, had Judge Chen Shuoying conduct a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. The court held that the plaintiff's company was not registered with the Ministry of Industry of the National Government and therefore could not pursue a private prosecution under the law. The court then ruled in court that the case was not accepted and the accompanying civil suit was dismissed. The plaintiff was also advised to request the police to file a public prosecution. The defendant was ordered to remain in custody during the appeal period.</p>

<h3>黑人牙膏行世</h3>
<p>Darkie Toothpaste is on the market.</p>
<p>Hereto-Amorin solution, ointment, face cream, and face powder, exclusively managed by Baichanghang, 266 Beijing Road, are sold throughout the country with a high reputation. Recently, a Darkie Toothpaste has been launched. Based on the principle that Africans do not use toothpaste or tooth powder, but their teeth are mostly white and neat, research has been conducted to discover that the twigs chewed by Africans daily contain a rich amount of tooth-cleaning phytosterol. This has been scientifically formulated to create a special quality that has the effect of whitening teeth and killing cavities. When viewed under a 500x microscope, this special quality reveals countless oval crystals. Following the principles of dentistry, it excludes the ordinary raw materials of current toothpastes and tooth powders, and is formulated with dozens of beneficial qualities for teeth. Therefore, its effectiveness can indeed whiten teeth, kill cavities, eliminate bad breath, and strengthen gums. Even yellowish smoke teeth that have not been brushed for many years can be transformed into white and clean teeth in a few days by brushing with Darkie Toothpaste. If teeth are fermenting, the latent tooth worms can be eliminated immediately by brushing with Darkie Toothpaste, and other uncorrupted teeth can be prevented from being affected. It also guarantees no bad breath within 24 hours. Another difference is that when brushing teeth, there is a rustling sound. This is not the sound of the toothbrush brushing, nor the sound of the toothpaste being thick and thick, but the sound of the plant cleaning elements and special wonderful agents washing away the gaps in the teeth. Therefore, it is unique to Darkie Toothpaste. As for the cleanliness of the tin tube and the beauty of the printing and decoration, they are trivial matters. Therefore, the widespread sales and popularity of Darkie Toothpaste are within expectations.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Changes in July and August of This Year (Continued) (Thirty-eighth of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Overview)</h3>
<p>— Edited by China WeChat</p>
<p>(5) Changes in the branches of the World Book Company: Recently, after the twenty-two counties of eastern Hebei Province switched to using puppet textbooks, the business of the Tianjin branch plummeted, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, the board of directors decided to close the Tianjin branch and establish a new branch in Kaifeng. It is said that most of the inventory and original staff of the Tianjin branch were also transferred to the Kaifeng branch.</p>
<p>In July, the number of new retail businesses increased by two compared to the previous month, while the number of closures also increased by five compared to the previous month, indicating a continuing trend of decline from the previous month. The more important ones are briefly listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Li Yang Silk and Satin Store Closed: This store had been in business for over twenty years and was solely operated by Mr. Zhang Liehong. It was one of the major silk merchants in Shanghai. Its business was generally prosperous on ordinary days. However, recently, due to the market downturn and increasing competition among peers, it became difficult to maintain. On the first of this month, Mr. Zhang suddenly left with all the staff, and all goods and account books were also moved away, resulting in an informal bankruptcy.</p>
<p>(2) Tong Shun Silk Store Liquidation: This store had been open for over ten years. Previously, the owner of the store invested 1,000 yuan in the stock of the World Bank and simultaneously overdrawn over 1,100 yuan from the bank. After the World Bank ceased operations, the invested capital could not be recovered, but the overdraft had to be repaid urgently. Recently, the liquidator of the World Bank applied for seizure, forcing the store to close down.</p>
<p>(3) The Three Stores of Mr. Chu Qi Liquidation: Mr. Chu is the owner of the Maosheng He Qiji Tea and Leg Store on Nanjing Road, the Wang Wuting Tea Store on Route Cardinal Mercier, and the Tongfeng Maoji Leg Store in Xiaodongmen. The three stores' business was usually prosperous, with Maosheng He Qiji on Nanjing Road being the most successful, as it was located under the Letian Tea House and was a central hub of Shanghai traffic. The other two stores were also large in scale. In recent years, due to the impact of the economic downturn, business was slow, and economic turnover was difficult. On the 16th, the liquidation was announced simultaneously.</p>
<p>(4) Lao Fu Xing Shoe Store Liquidation: This store was established in 1927 with a capital of 3,000 national currency, solely founded by Mr. Liu Jiukang. Its business was usually quite stable. Recently, due to the market downturn, it repeatedly suffered losses and owed rent for as long as eight months. Therefore, the landlord, the Gongping Foreign Firm, sued in court, and the court executed the seizure, forcing the store to announce liquidation.</p>
<p>(5) World Industrial Company Business Closed: This company was solely founded by Mr. Wu Liegang, specializing in general merchandise. It also leased part of the store's space to other manufacturers to join in business. It had been in business for over two years. Recently, due to the sluggish market, poor business, competition from peers, and plummeting prices, as well as high rent and large expenses, economic turnover was difficult. Therefore, it had to announce liquidation.</p>
<p>(6) Opening of the Shanghai Antique Market: This market was initiated by over 500 antique dealers, expanding and relocating the original antique market at No. 74 Jiangxi Road. Currently, 70 companies have joined, making it the first large-scale antique market in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>First Encounter Between Chinese and Western Heroes: Cai Huiquan Defeats Carson: Result 4-6, 6-4, 6-3</h3>
<p>The tennis team of Shanghai University in Hongkou invited Carson, Cai Huiquan, Chen Runyuan, and Chen Qihao to the school yesterday for guidance and demonstration to improve their skills. The match between Carson and Cai was the most interesting. Both sides had skillful techniques and excellent postures. Although there were judgments of strength and weakness in physique, the techniques were comparable. However, Cai's backhand stroke was superior to Carson's, only the high pressure and serve were slower than Carson's. Yesterday's demonstration match was held at 2:30 PM. As a result of the toss, Cai served first. The first game was tied seven times, and finally Carson broke through. Cai also occupied Carson's serving game. Afterwards, Carson's momentum was quite strong and he won the first set with 6-4. In the deciding set, both sides won the game with the serve to make it 3-3. Then Carson went ahead 4-3. Cai took three games in a row to pull back the second set with 6-4. In the third set, Cai got the first game, and Carson chased to 1-1. Soon Cai made it 3-1, and Carson chased to 2-3. After Cai won two more games in a row, Carson only added one game. In the ninth game, Cai served. After two equalities, Cai went to the net to block and kill, and completed the great achievement with a light backhand cut, and defeated the stubborn Carson for a while with two to one, creating a good memory of the first encounter between the two. In the three sets, Carson attacked fiercely, while Cai used softness to overcome strength. Especially a few backhand slices and light blows on the baseline can be described as magical. After a short rest, Carson teamed up with Sun Yiqin, and Cai cooperated with Tang Baojia. This doubles match, Tang's group first won the first set with 6-4. Cai's group was repaid by Carson's group in the same way, each winning one. In the third set, Cai and Tang's group easily won again with 6-2, and then defeated Carson's group with two to one. At the same time, on the second court, Chen Runyuan, who had just returned from England, played a singles match with Tang Baojia. As a result, Chen won two games in a row with his superior skills. Then Chen cooperated with Chen Gonghao and played doubles against Kang Guangan and Sali Quan, the runner-up of Shanghai University. The strength of both sides was equal. Only one set was played, and it was dark and the game was over. Victory belonged to the two Chens, and the score was 11-9. The director of the school's sports department, American Professor Qi Hefu and his wife, hosted a tea party at their residence, and everyone dispersed in joy. The results of each group are as follows. Also, Cai and Chen Runyuan will go to Hangzhou at 3:00 PM this afternoon accompanied by Chen Qihao, return to Shanghai by night train tomorrow, and perform again in Fudan the day after tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Tilden Talks About Tennis Methods: Li Huitang Records</h3>
<p>The famous "William Tilden II" does not need me to introduce him. I believe that people who pay a little attention to tennis or understand world sports have a considerable understanding of him. This time, he and that young and handsome "Asheville Barnes" came to the East to perform their skills, stirring up the infinite excitement of East Asian tennis players. In the past, I read their achievements in newspapers or magazines, or sometimes caught a glimpse of their quick skills on the screen. I always felt a great regret that I could not be there to appreciate their superb skills in person. Today, we are still fortunate enough to have the opportunity to see their style in Hong Kong, and I am even more fortunate to be able to shake hands and talk with them.</p>
<p>At 6:30 PM on November 9, after the performance match between Tilden and Barnes, they gave a public speech in the Grand Terrace Garden of the Hong Kong Hotel. Hundreds of people gathered because of their reputation. In sixty minutes, Tilden talked about the scriptures, which were fascinating. He was still holding a racket in his hand, showing various grip methods, and sometimes demonstrating various hitting postures. His crane-shaped wide back, Ming Taizu-style chin, and authentic American voice were all materials that made people laugh, not to mention that he also mixed in humorous tones and humorous actions from time to time. He was not only a born tennis freak, but also a talented speaker. The following is a brief record of the main points of his talk:</p>
<p>General People's Mistakes</p>
<p>Many people have fundamentally wrong ideas, thinking that the game of tennis relies entirely on the movement of the hand holding the racket. In fact, this is a big mistake. Tennis is a thing that combines intelligence, eyesight, and body propulsion to achieve miraculous effects. The hand holding the racket is only responsible for the work of transmission. Also, the most important thing is the movement of the feet, which should be paid more attention to than the movement of the hands. If the pace is disordered, there will be few good performances. Ordinary people also have misunderstandings, thinking that the beginning and the end of tennis are the moment when the racket hits the ball. In fact, it has already started before the ball touches the racket, and it cannot be considered over even after the racket hits the ball.</p>
<p>Three Principles of Tennis</p>
<p>There are three basic principles of tennis. First, from the moment the ball is served until the ball dies, the eyes should be tightly focused on the ball, and the line of sight should be concentrated, and should not be shifted by the scenery outside the court. Although many players' eyes follow the ball, sometimes when the ball reaches their side, they raise their heads to observe the position of their opponents and forget to follow the ball with their eyes at the moment when the ball touches the racket, which sometimes causes the point of hitting the ball to not be in the center of the racket, which is not advisable for wise people. Top players do not need to observe the position of their opponents, because the secret of tennis lies in hitting the ball far away from the opponent's body, not hitting it next to the opponent's body, so that it is easier for them to return the ball. The second and third points are related, that is, when hitting the ball, you must turn your body and face the net sideways. It is difficult to have a good work if you hit the ball facing the net. When the racket hits the ball, the body should also have forward propulsion at the same time to increase the momentum of the ball. Therefore, beginners of tennis should have a deep understanding of these three points, and train their posture purely before taking a further step to seek hitting methods, otherwise the foundation is wrong, and it is difficult to have great gains.</p>
<p>The Most Important Hitting Method</p>
<p>Although there are many kinds of tennis hitting methods, the most important and most commonly used is the forehand stroke. If the forehand is not good, even if other hitting methods are excellent, it is difficult to hope to step onto the world stage. When stroking the ball, the left foot should be advanced, the body should face the net sideways, and wait for the ball to reach the height of the waist to meet it. If the ball comes too high, wait for it to fall to the same level as the waist before hitting it. If it is too low, you should bend your knees and squat down to hit it to match the steps. The backhand stroke has the same principles as the forehand stroke, only the left and right are switched. Serving is a thing that many people think is a medium for the ball game and ignore it. However, they do not know that serving is a sharp weapon for attack. Players should practice hard and not give up this right of attack. Although there are different types of serves, there are only two that are practical: one is the sliced ​​style, and the other is the American spin style. As for high-pressure balls, volley balls, cut balls, low passing balls, lobs, half volley balls, volley lobs, and all kinds of hitting methods, they all have their own value. However, when training hitting methods, you must first seek accuracy and then gradually increase the speed to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Differences Between Men and Women</p>
<p>People often ask about the differences between men's and women's tennis. I think that due to the natural physical conditions of women, they are only suitable for baseline tactics and not suitable for net-front tactics. Men are different. In terms of physical strength, they are mainly based on baseline tactics, and in terms of mentality, they are mainly based on net-front tactics. Once there is an opportunity, they should go to the net to intercept and kill. Women's strength is not enough, and it is difficult to cope with them. As for those who are good at strokes, they must be able to beat those who are good at blocking the net. Experience and past achievements tell the truth. However, when meeting each other's long strokes and equal strength, those who are also good at defending the net must take advantage of it, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>Impressions of Listeners</p>
<p>After Mr. Tilden's speech was over, people in the audience asked about the difficult points, and he answered them one by one, which was quite interesting. Among them, there are many talks based on personal experience. In short, that one hour in the evening is deeply imprinted in people's minds, and it is recognized by people that it is not worth the trip. It is a pity that what he talked about that night were the basic principles and methods for beginners. Anyone who has read his book "Secrets of the Game and the Rebound of the Ball" knows that what he said this time is adding a little action, Chen Zhangzai's gift. He has played it through in that book. Most of the audience that night were people with a little tennis foundation and experience. He should have mixed his life experience and the more advanced mysteries of the game to guide them, which would be more interesting and valuable. However, no matter what kind of sport, it is impossible to improve in one day or one hearing and one lecture.</p>
<p>Tilden and Pan Lai</p>
<p>Many people mean that Tilden has a bit of a weird personality and his temper is different from ordinary people. His comments in writing or verbally are sometimes stubborn and prejudiced. Years ago, he saw the famous English player "Fulei Pan Lai" and said that his hitting method was wrong and it was difficult to achieve great things. Today, Mr. Pan is sitting high on the throne, and Mr. Tilden still does not change his old tune, and often says that the German king "Feng Gelinmu" is a better talent, so the British people are not very fond of Mr. Tilden, and there are often articles criticizing him in magazines and newspapers. But the benevolent sees benevolence, and the wise sees wisdom. Mr. Tilden may have other intentions. Perhaps he has a unique eye. Who can have an accurate and accurate judgment on right and wrong?</p>
<p>The Skills of Tilden and Van</p>
<p>These two days they performed in Hong Kong, it's really a feast for the eyes. Their speed and strength of serving, their composure in responding, their accuracy in long strokes, the beauty of their posture, and the regularity of their steps are not only unprecedented, I am afraid that there will be no one to come after them, because even if good players come in the future, but there is no one to fight against, it is difficult to elicit their wonderful and subtle points. In short, their decision to come and show their skills is enough to make us open our eyes, and their outstanding skills make you applaud and exclaim automatically, thinking that it is the highest peak of art.</p>
<h3>Lincoln Wheel Has a Late Saying</h3>
<p>Tiefan Erjue's performance may not be as scheduled Tilden Barnes will pass through Shanghai again on his way back to China on the 20th of this month, and he has decided to give a second performance. Everything is ready. Yesterday morning, Kanafan Luo suddenly heard that the Lincoln Wheel had a delay in the shift for some reason, so it is still uncertain whether it can be performed as scheduled on the 20th. Now Ka and others have urgently telegraphed to inquire about the truth. According to the reporter's inquiry to the China Travel Service, it is said that he has not heard of it. The tickets have been sold at the Time Review Foreign Company yesterday. If the wheel is delayed, it can still be used during the performance.</p>

<h3>Zhang Boling Arrives in Beijing to Visit Minister Wang</h3>

Zhang will fly to Chongqing on the 16th to inspect the Nanyu Middle School and will also take the opportunity to inspect the education in Sichuan Province.

According to the discussion, the proposal passed by the Sports Association to the government to set up the highest sports authority still needs a considerable amount of time to be submitted by the association to the government for a decision. My opinion on developing national sports is based on many years of school-running experience. I believe that primary school students should first receive good sports education to cultivate their strong physique. This is the foundation for developing national sports and should be given special attention.</p>

<h3>Securities: Bulls Vigorously Raise Public Bonds; Class A Sees New High Price; Forward Contract at 71.55 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a great change in market prices on the Chinese Securities Exchange. The rise in wind and the enthusiasm for buying were much higher than on Tuesday and Wednesday. One of the propaganda said that there are various agreements between China and the United States, which are timely in China and Japan, and it seems that it will not expand. Taking the opportunity, they organized a bull company, so they raised prices blindly and spared no effort. They repeatedly said that the market had shown signs of fatigue, but in the end it revived. The force of the pull-up was not strong. However, after the rise, it must come out to get the result. Class A has seen a new high price that has not been seen since the unified public bonds. The market price has reached a considerable height, so the situation at the opening of the market in the afternoon has changed slightly. The first and last two types were raised, but the middle was released, and there were gradually flaws. At the close of the market, the E type plummeted, and the bulls were afraid of its decline, so they engaged in pull-up again. They worked hard and still had energy, but some bulls have already sold off, and the future may have a whirlwind of great losses, which cannot be too optimistic. Yesterday's experience, at the beginning of the opening, there was another assassination incident, and the selling sentiment was very strong, but many people immediately stood up and raised the price. The market price was initially tired and then recovered, and people's hearts suddenly vibrated. The increase was very strong, with a high of 3.5 to 6.5 cents. No. 4, No. 5, No. 11, etc. bought enthusiastically. No. 11 and No. 54 sold slightly. In the next session, the E type rose by 5 cents on the upper board this month, and the rebound was so fierce that it was almost 1 yuan. The last column is still good for 5 cents to 1.4 cents. No. 4 and No. 5 still consistently pull up again. In the afternoon opening, it was slightly chaotic. The bulls only held the first and last two types of E and A to prevent them from falling, while D, C, and B types were all sold, obviously showing a clear advance and a dark exit. No. 11 and No. 16 sold very strongly. The E type fell sharply by half a yuan at the close of the market, and the C type still rose by 1 or 2 cents, and the rest were flat. No. 4 has already sold off. As a result of the market price, the A type rose by 1 yuan, which was the most. The rest were mostly good for 4 to 8 cents. The total transaction volume was more than 20 million. The result of its rise and fall is compared in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers: Cotton Production Estimated to Shrink; Cotton Prices Rise Again; Rumors of Exports of Old Coarse Velvet</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the rise in wind has revived. It is said that the cotton production is estimated to be reduced to 14 million dans, which is 2 million dans less than the previous quantity. At the same time, it is also said that 7,000 coarse velvet cotton bales are loaded and exported, so people's hearts are shaken, and the market is advancing.</p>
<p>Spot Flowers Rise by 7 to 8 Cents</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot flower market, the near-month market was very firm. Because it had been falling for many days, the profit-takers patched up. The market rose slowly. Although the overseas Indian and American cotton markets fell all the way, it was still difficult to stop people's hearts. In fact, too many floating households have been selling short, and the reaction has been good. In addition, there is a rumor in the market that the cotton production is estimated to be reduced, so there is a lack of sellers, and the market is turning firm. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. At the opening of the market in the afternoon, each month jumped sharply, and the momentum was quite firm. There were rumors that coarse velvet cotton was exported, and floating households were very eager to cover their shorts. The market price rose steadily. As a result, each month rose by another 3.5 to 5.5 cents compared with the morning closing price. It is found that 5,700 dans of Run Kang, 5,800 dans of Xingchang, 1,800 dans of Jin Kang, 1,700 dans of Chang Ji, 3,200 dans of Juxing, 3,500 dans of Yuan Da, 6,200 dans of Jinchang, 2,100 dans of Minghua, 2,300 dans of Shenchang, 7,200 dans of Taichang, 2,500 dans of Shengyuan, 4,600 dans of Fukang, 3,900 dans of Xincheng, 3,100 dans of Yikang, and 4,900 dans of Yuanxingchang were sold. 3,600 bales of Mingde, 4,000 bales of Fengtai, 4,200 bales of Shenji, 2,000 bales of Dachang, 2,000 bales of Tonghe, 4,400 bales of Gengfeng, 6,200 bales of Renfeng, 5,200 bales of Yuanyi, 7,500 bales of Dachangcheng, 12,800 bales of Hengyi, and 5,000 bales of Hexing were bought. The highest and lowest prices during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Difficult to Approach Spot Cotton Transactions</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is mediocre. Because of the rise in cotton futures, negotiations between the two sides are difficult to approach. The source is 1,100 bales of Yao flowers and 950 bales of Tong flowers.</p>

<h3>The Rumor of Good News is Prospering Again; Cotton Yarn Rebounds; The Bulls in This Month are Also Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market was flat in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the situation turned tight. Because the raw cotton rose and the Osaka First-Class Yarn Market rebounded recently, people's hearts are good, and the bulls are still making efforts for the near-month yarn. Because the yarn in the warehouse is weak, but the spot yarn business is not very smooth. Although there were about 2,000 bales traded today, half of them were bought by the same industry to make thoughts.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Rebounds by About 2 Yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market, the current month rebounded due to the sharp drop on the 10th, reaching 230 yuan again. However, it turned weak when it was auctioned to the forward contract. After the second round, it was heard that the Osaka Third-Class Yarn Market had fallen back, and the spot yarn market was not very healthy. The big households came to spit it out again, and the stage suddenly loosened. The market turned downward. As a result, the prices for January and February each rose by 1 cent compared with the closing price of the previous day, and the rest did not move. At the opening of the market in the afternoon, the near-month market was quite firm. Because public bonds rose, the market spread rumors that the inflation of currency was raised again. After the second round, the buying sentiment was even stronger, and the market price rose step by step. As a result, each month rose by 1.7 to 2.8 yuan compared with the morning closing price. It is found that 1,250 bales of Hengyi, 1,200 bales of Juxing, 950 bales of Senkang, 650 bales of Dafu, 1,950 bales of Yuda, 3,550 bales of Jinchang, 2,800 bales of Mingde, 2,600 bales of Xingchang, 1,600 bales of Dachangcheng, 850 bales of Ruid, and 700 bales of Xiacheng were sold. 1,850 bales of Dafeng, 1,200 bales of Changji, 3,400 bales of Shenji, 1,300 bales of Taichang, 1,200 bales of Yichang, 2,600 bales of Dachang, 1,100 bales of Wangtaixing, 3,450 bales of Changfeng, 1,600 bales of Runkang, 800 bales of Fengtai, 800 bales of Tongxun, and 700 bales of Gengfeng were bought. The highest and lowest prices during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>More Than 1,900 Bales of Yarn Sold</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It is found that 1,960 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day. The selling price rose by 1 yuan, and the money rose by 3 yuan. The buying amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Inland 520 Jiangsi 90 Changsha 310</p>
<p>Yunnan 115 Ningbo 5 Shantou 85</p>
<p>Same Industry 720 Tianjin 50 Guangdong 65</p>
<h3>Heavy Selling Pressure on American Cotton</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with bad news from Liverpool. The Liverpool gang sold off, the bulls closed out, and the cotton farmers hedged. Each month fell by 4 to 6 pounds per sound. Then the industry bought in when it fell, and it stabilized slightly. However, the selling pressure was very heavy, and the buyers mainly relied on the weak silver price. News from Washington said that Agriculture Minister Wallace may agree to stop the new cotton management plan until a large amount of production causes a large surplus. The market price fell by one point. After that, the cooperative sold off, and the market price became more tired. When the market closed, some shorts were covered, and it was slightly stable. It is estimated that the spot price fell by 4 pounds per sound, and the futures price fell by 4 to 16 pounds per sound. The British cotton spot price fell by 6 points, and the futures price fell by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton rose due to reports that the Aumla cotton area continued to have wind and rain, and European exporters bought Aumla. Later, it fell back due to bad news from Liverpool. It is estimated that Pingor fell by 0.25 rupees, Aumla did not move, and Bairachi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the forecast for the opening on the 13th was Bairachi at 217 rupees, up 0.25, Aumla at 198 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Pingor at 158 rupees, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Three-Product Yarn Rises and Flowers Fall</h3>
<p>According to the Osaka telegram on the 13th, the three-product yarn futures rose by 2 yuan to fall by 1 cent. The near month was 233.4 yuan, and the far month was 109.3 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 3 to 4 cents. The near month was 65.05 yuan, and the far month was 65.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Factory's Futures Plate is Looser</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was firm because the cotton markets at home and abroad saw mixed ups and downs, the domestic spot yarn and flowers rose step by step, and the sales volume of spot yarn was considerable, causing the cloth price to remain solid. The factory's recent futures attitude is firm because there are still huge amounts of orders that have not been cleared, and the amount of goods is insufficient. However, the factory's futures plate is looser for the long-term futures because customers are not very interested in entering. The output of each factory is mostly fine twill and fine cloth. Yesterday, the spot fine cloth and grey fine twill were sold out due to the fact that the daily factory strike had a solution. The people who held the spot goods returned their minds and loosened, and the selling price fell back (per piece) by 5 points. The stack of goods is still sold at the original plate. The heavy-weight coarse cloth market of this factory is sluggish, but the light-weight coarse cloth and the fine cloth and fine twill of this factory are still good because of the lack of output. Yesterday, the demand from Hankou, Changsha, Hengzhou and other gangs along the Yangtze River was still good. They handled 100 pieces of spot fine twill, fine cloth, flannel, straight tribute, billie, and other goods. The Guangdong and Yunnan gangs entered more than 400 pieces of this month and December fine twill, straight tribute, billie, silk crepe de chine, printed poplin, straight tribute, etc. However, the actual needs of most customer gangs still lack a turnaround. The stock of each factory's printed straight tribute, billie, silk crepe de chine, and so on is getting thicker and there is no way out. The price of grey cloth is very expensive.</p>
<h3>Grains: Covering Shorts and New Longs Rise Together; Flour Prices Become Stronger; Far Month Reaches 8.25 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was full of buying sentiment, turning into a booming situation again. According to foreign wheat reports, Chicago was good for 1 or 2 cents, Canada was a small number of cents, and Liverpool was a small number of 0.375 cents. Although the foreign atmosphere was calm, the trend of raw materials was very firm due to the continuous decline in the market. The factory gradually recovered the recent chips, and non-industry hoarders successively entered the market, so after the opening in the morning, it saw an increase. After that, the shorts were covered, and the new longs took advantage of the situation to climb, and the rising momentum became more intense with both efforts. Throughout the day, each month, near and far, rose by about 5 cents to more than 8 cents. At the close of the market, the situation was still healthy.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Also Rise by More Than 1 Cent</h3>
<p>After the opening of the wheat futures market yesterday morning, the foreign wheat saw mixed ups and downs, and the atmosphere was peaceful. For a time, there was no approaching situation. The floating shorts for profit rose to cover the market, and the market was grateful for the firm spot wheat. The sources from all over the world are blocked by transportation, and the market is separated from the peak by almost 3 cents. Gradually, it has a heart to move upward, so at the opening in the morning, each month, near and far, jumped up by 5, 6, or 7 cents. After that, the flour market reported a rise, and the enthusiasm was full. The increase in each month reached 1 cent or more. However, the rise was too sharp, and there was a slight floating long return. The situation gradually stabilized in the afternoon, and each month rose by 1 cent to 1.2 cents compared with the previous day. Due to the rise in wheat futures, the sellers held on tighter, so the transaction was still fresh. Only Shenda entered 400 bales of Huaian wheat, the price was 5.92 yuan.</p>
<h3>River Rice Arrivals More Prosperous Yesterday</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The sources of various gangs arrived a total of 160 to 170 numbers in the previous two days, with a total of 34,500 to 34,600 piculs of goods. Among them, thin rice accounted for two-thirds. Fortunately, the appetite for thin rice was also smooth. The Qingyan and Tianjin gangs handled more than 15,000 bales in total, and nearly 1,000 bales of thick new japonica. Therefore, the market for thin rice did not plummet, and it was slightly repaired by 1 or 2 cents. The various colors of Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) The arrivals of various gangs under the river in the previous two days were surging and prosperous, with 110 numbers. The market's appetite was sluggish, and the short-priced ones were slightly mobilized. The new japonica price was a small number of cents to 1 cent, and the early rice followed by a small cent. The appetite for thin rice was weak, and the market was also sluggish. The price was a small number of cents. Yang Dufu and Jian also saw a small number of 3 or 5 cents. The guest tips saw soft prices, and the stock of Bianyuan River was surging and thick. The wine households stopped handling, and the price was short of about 1 cent. There were few Yin Yuan goods, and the market price was tired.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Gang Handles Rough Rice Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for guest indica rice saw a slight turnaround. Because the arrivals have been decreasing day by day recently, and the guest mobilization is still active, the market seems to be gradually becoming firmer. Yesterday, the Cantonese gang had the most greedy appetite. In addition to smoothly handling rough rice, there were also inquiries about stone and machine rice. The stock of rough rice was originally dry, and the new arrivals were also few, so yesterday it saw a sharp rise of more than 1 cent again. Other types of rice also saw a slight increase of 2, 3, or 4, 5 cents. A total of more than 6,800 bales of Jiangxi rice, 1,421 bales of Hunan rice, and 410 bales of Taiwan rice were opened throughout the day. The rough rice and stone broken rice were handled by the Guangdong gang, while the machine rice was mostly handled by the local and Henan gangs.</p>
<p>Correction I would like to inform you that I read today's commercial news column of your newspaper "Oil Bean Cakes Rise Uniformly." The recent sales of oil bean cakes have been active, and the Dalian market has continued to rise, causing the market to tighten uniformly. Yesterday, the Doubing did 15,000 pieces of the Daichang Factory's futures and spot Four Brand Cakes. Although the market was unchanged, the selling price of the factory's products was one or two points lower than other factories during the peak season. It is found that the selling price of the factory's oil bean cakes has always been in accordance with the market, and there is no other low market. It is obviously fabricated by unscrupulous people, intending to damage the factory's reputation, which is very hateful. It is about the factory's reputation, so it must be carefully investigated by your newspaper and corrected quickly to revitalize the audience, which is important. Daichang New Stream Oil Company.</p>
<h3>Metals: Prices Rising for All Goods</h3>
<p>Prices for all metal goods, including black and white iron, as well as copper, lead, and tin, are on the rise. This is due to foreign factories reducing production (mainly to manufacture munitions), leading to numerous order delays. Business in this port city is booming, causing shortages in various markets, and thus prices are only rising, not falling. For example, refined lead has skyrocketed by three to four yuan, selling for 29 yuan. Block tin has risen by over ten yuan, selling for 194-195 yuan for the Xiao Heng brand and 214-215 yuan for the Dutch brand. Copper sheet prices have jumped from 55-56 yuan to 61-62 yuan, marking a significant increase. Other goods, such as white lead sheet, have risen by four to five yuan, selling for 155 yuan. Steel plates have increased by one yuan and a half, selling for twelve yuan. The market price for bamboo steel bars has also increased from 124-125 yuan to 130 yuan. However, the trading of the aforementioned goods is very active. Other items such as raw silk, angle iron, silver dollars, road leather, and lead wire are also reportedly on the rise.</p>

<h3>Dried Goods - Spring Bubbled Longan Expected to Arrive Today - Totaling Over 4,000 Boxes</h3>
<p>According to sources, the fourth batch of Quanzhou large-bubble dried longan has been shipped from the port on the Hua Ping vessel and is en route. It was originally set at 3,000 [boxes], but slightly increased later, totaling over 4,000 boxes. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. It is said that the cost has increased compared to before, which may not align with Shanghai's pricing. If the price negotiations between the trading firms are not close, they may need to hold back the goods.</p>
<h3>Family Construction</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>A nation indeed needs construction, and so does a family. The responsibility for family construction undoubtedly falls more heavily on the shoulders of women. Therefore, I would like to bring this issue up for discussion.</p>
<p>Family construction can be divided into two major parts: material construction and spiritual construction.</p>
<p>Material construction can be divided into the following items:</p>
<p>*   The tidiness of the home, such as the proper placement of all objects and furniture, making it aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>*   Cleanliness and hygiene, such as regularly dusting and sweeping floors and windows. Regularly washing and disinfecting clothes and bedding. Food and drinks must be thoroughly steamed and cooked. Sour, rotten, or unclean items should be absolutely discarded. During seasons when epidemics occur, such as the prevalence of smallpox, cholera, malaria, and typhoid fever, efforts must be made to prevent the occurrence or spread of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>*   Establishing a budget to reduce unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>*   Striving for savings to establish a solid foundation for the family's economic stability.</p>
<p>*   Promoting exercise and noble entertainment, such as walking in the park, traveling to the countryside. Playing ball, such as tennis or table tennis. Visiting model families, holding family tea parties to exchange knowledge or opinions, subscribing to beneficial books and newspapers to increase knowledge, and playing musical instruments such as zithers.</p>
<p>*   Promoting home industry, such as weaving, knitting, and children's bamboo and woodworking.</p>
<p>Spiritual construction can be divided into the following items:</p>
<p>*   Creating an atmosphere of tranquility in the home, such as not speaking loudly intentionally. Placing objects gently, not carelessly. Children not knocking on tables and desks. Avoiding sudden running sounds.</p>
<p>*   Creating an atmosphere of harmony in the home. All issues between husband and wife should be absolutely open and handled with mutual understanding and forgiveness. Treat children with patient guidance, never striking or scolding them. Treat servants with kindness and gentleness, not with harsh words or expressions.</p>
<p>*   Cultivating good habits of tidiness, cleanliness, and exercise.</p>
<p>*   Cultivating compassion and mutual aid, but not involving superstition.</p>
<p>*   Cultivating a spirit of adventure and courage, but not wildness or recklessness. At the same time, patience must be trained, but absolutely not cowardice. Special attention must be paid when training children.</p>
<p>*   Cultivating habits of frugality, but not to the point of stinginess.</p>
<p>*   Cultivating a love of diligence. In particular, children must be made to perform domestic service for a certain amount of time each day to cultivate habits of diligence and responsibility.</p>
<p>*   Speaking must be frank and honest, without lying, concealing, or making meaningless jokes. Display dignity within gentleness.</p>
<p>*   Refrain from extravagance in tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, and unnecessary sweets and food. All household items must be made, as much as possible, of domestic goods.</p>
<p>Individuals living in families that meet the standards of both material and spiritual well-being will undoubtedly be outstanding members of society. Furthermore, children trained in such families will undoubtedly be superior little citizens of the nation. However, unproductive citizens are useless and harmful to the nation and its people. To create excellent citizens capable of carrying forward and expanding the nation's glory, we must first start by working hard on family construction. May the housewives of the nation rise up and work directly on family construction, and indirectly promote the construction of society and the nation.</p>
<h3>A Female Hero Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>In the 52nd year before the Republic, Gengshen year, the sixth year of Emperor Xianfeng of the Qing Dynasty, the Anglo-French allied forces invaded Tianjin, directly threatening Beijing, burning the Old Summer Palace. Emperor Wenzong sought refuge in Rehe. The situation was dire. Fortunately, the Russian envoy Ignatiev mediated and negotiated the Treaty of Beijing. Our Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to Britain in this war, with countless losses in terms of ports opened and indemnities paid. At that time, the Chinese army relied on soldiers armed with swords and rattan shields to defend our territory. As for military weapons, we only had muzzle-loading guns! Of course, we couldn't compete with their giant ships carrying cannons weighing thousands of tons. But at that time, there was a female hero near the Old Summer Palace who witnessed the increasing foreign aggression and the imminent crisis of the nation. She raised the banner of rebellion, bravely resisting the enemy. Unfortunately, she was outnumbered and ultimately defeated. But as a weak woman who could bravely defend against the strong enemy, she is truly worthy of our admiration!</p>
<p>The female hero's name was Wan Zhen, surnamed Feng, originally from Shandong. She was 19 years old. Her father's name was Sanbao, skilled in martial arts. During the war of the allied forces, her family happened to live in Xiezhuang, ten miles away from the Old Summer Palace. Because she had been practicing martial arts with her father since she was a child, she was quite good at boxing. When the allied forces burned the Old Summer Palace, she did not want Xiezhuang to fall into the hands of the enemy. She gathered young people from the village, dressed in black and armed with white blades, to protect their homeland. They ambushed in the forest. Soon after, enemy cavalry arrived with cannons. She led the crowd, wielding knives and slashing fiercely, attacking them from both sides. They moved swiftly and bravely, mowing down everything in their path! The Western soldiers suffered a major defeat, abandoning their cannons and fleeing, with numerous deaths and injuries. Due to the overwhelming disparity in numbers, they had to retreat. This page of anti-enemy history may not be recorded in official history, so I specifically record it to encourage future generations.</p>
<h3>Glorious Women</h3>
<p>— Fang Lijun</p>
<p>Correspondence from Xikang</p>
<p>This is our Chinese society's fixed iron circle. From ancient times, it has been a male-centered society. Women are merely appendages of men. Therefore, there is fundamentally no place for women in Chinese society. This is an undeniable fact before us. However, when we look back at the women of Xikang and the current state of their society, we are surprised and find it hard to believe. Because the customs of Xikang are completely different from ours; in other words, it is exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>The state of Xikang society: men, apart from hunting and going to other places to do business, leave all other household chores and affairs to the full responsibility of women. Furthermore, even in the city's shops, the staff are exclusively women, working diligently. Because Xikang society is centered on women.</p>
<p>Because it is a female-centered society, it is the same as areas that are male-centered societies. In Xikang, polyandry is prevalent, opposing the polygamy system here. This may be due to the environment and traditional concepts.</p>
<p>They are open and free about social interactions between men and women; they do not have the constraints of old customs and feudalism. Regarding the relationship between the sexes, as long as both the man and woman agree, they can freely unite. Moreover, some women may not even have consulted their parents when they have fallen in love or have other relations with a man. They only inform them afterward, and then hold a simple and quick wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>As for the lives of women in rural Xikang? Their work is complex and busy. They are responsible for all the hard work, from sowing, fertilizing, to plowing, harvesting, and so on. In addition, many women also engage in animal husbandry. Apart from accompanying the herds of cattle and sheep to the mountains, they sometimes also have to take care of the cows and sheep in the pasture, and keep watch at night. From morning to night, they have no time to rest. Thus, if we compare the sisters of Xikang with the parasitic women in the crazy cities who apply powder and rouge, go to the cinema, go to dance halls, and are played with as toys by men, the difference between them is too great. The former are laborers who produce for society, while the latter are useless parasites.</p>
<p>So, let us say it frankly and happily: one has fulfilled the responsibility of being human, while the other is only for consumption and has no soul. They have simply lost their human form!</p>
<p>Their clothing varies depending on their economic status. The common people mostly wear cotton or woolen cloth. The aristocrats wear fine woolen cloth or Tibetan cloth imported from India. The style of their clothes is a round collar, long sleeves, from shoulder to ankle, with a floral belt tied around the waist, and a coat or shawl is worn on the outside. And the feudal poison that is most preserved in mainland China—breast binding, is considered a strange trend there; therefore, there is absolutely no trace of it.</p>
<p>Every New Year or festival is their happiest time. They invite many friends to join in the group celebration at night. They wear beautiful and delicate clothes, hold hands and dance, and sing. They also welcome men to join their group. They do not sleep until late at night.</p>
<p>The women of Xikang are glorious and worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>The Life of Women on West Dongting Mountain</h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>West Dongting Mountain is an isolated island in Taihu Lake, about 90 li by water from Suzhou. It is not only scenic, but also rich in products. Since the Taiping Rebellion, the mountain has rarely been affected by the situation, and even disasters and banditry have not been as severe as in other places. If it were not for the current rural bankruptcy, I think this place could be described as a paradise. But the education there is very backward, and the customs are very closed off, especially the lives of ordinary women, which are almost completely stuck in the eighteenth century. They are bound by the traditional concepts of feudal etiquette and are content to be slaves to men.</p>
<p>Almost 100% of the women here have not received an education. The thoughts of feudal etiquette govern their entire behavior, and the "three obediences and four virtues" dictate their entire lives. "At home, obey your mother; when married, obey your husband" is their unchanging women's virtue, and "strictly guard chastity and obey your husband" is the great righteousness that every woman should understand. Therefore, on West Dongting Mountain, a woman who remarries after her husband's death is looked down upon by everyone. Moreover, when she remarries, she must choose a time late at night, when no one is around, to get into the sedan chair or perform the ceremony. It must be done in a deserted temple or on ownerless land. If someone sees it or gets into the sedan chair on someone else's land, it is considered unlucky and they must "pay respects" and light incense. However, a man who loses his wife can remarry at any time, and no one will criticize him.</p>
<p>The worst thing is to be a widow waiting for a husband you've never met. Some of them are child brides, while others have never even met their fiancé. But once their fiancé dies, they actually have to live the life of a widow. I believe there are no women in the world more pitiful than these! In the past, many women were willing to build a reputation for themselves as chaste and virtuous women. Therefore, wherever you went, you would see many arches of chastity or arches of virtue. But what are they for now? I really can't understand.</p>
<p>When a new daughter-in-law marries into the family, she has to bring "good luck" to the family for three years. If, after she enters the house, any of the flowers, fruits, silkworms, or rice does not have a good harvest, it is said that she has a bad fate. If the husband or parents-in-law get sick, or even die, then she cannot escape the crime of being an "eight-failure life" or a "white tiger star"!</p>
<p>In the countryside, it is a glorious thing for a man to steal another man's wife, but on the contrary, if a woman commits adultery, she will encounter the seven grounds for divorce. However, if a husband abandons his wife, the wife has no choice but to work as a servant to make a living, and cannot remarry. Therefore, many women here commit suicide or seek a quick death because they cannot bear the torture of life, but few cases are ever fairly adjudicated by the law. Most of them are dealt with in a perfunctory manner. It is very common for parents-in-law to abuse or even beat their daughters-in-law. If the daughter-in-law happens to resist the parents-in-law, everyone will think it is an act of "great rebellion".</p>
<p>Although modern law has recognized women's right to inherit property, the women here not only do not enjoy the rights granted by law, but also all economic power is in the hands of men. Therefore, a woman in the process of being a daughter-in-law is just a servant who washes clothes, cooks meals, and works tirelessly, or a machine for giving birth to children, but the result is still not as good as the treatment of a servant, let alone any compensation.</p>
<p>They suffer from excessive childbirth and excessive fatigue, and if they get sick, they are not given treatment or medical care. This is especially common, but they think that a daughter-in-law is like foot-washing water, and they can marry another one if she dies. Moreover, there is a local saying that "it is a great misfortune for a wealthy family not to have their daughter-in-law die for three years", so they look down on daughters-in-law very much there.</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the impact of rural bankruptcy, they have also embarked on the road of working as servants in the city in order to survive. Therefore, it is easy to encounter women from West Dongting Mountain in Shanghai, Suzhou, Huzhou, and other places recently. This is really not a good phenomenon!</p>
<p>At present, there are ten county-run primary schools, one private high school, and four primary schools on the mountain. Girls also seem to have a little opportunity to receive education, but due to the poison of tradition, only one or two out of a hundred girls can actually have the opportunity to enter the school gate.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to marriage, both men and women have very little autonomy and are still subject to matchmaker's words and parents' orders, a set of buying and selling behaviors.</p>
<p>Now, the slogans and facts of women's liberation are erupting like sparks, and all the problems have been very seriously shown to us. But this torrent of the times has not yet washed over those remote rural villages.</p>
<p>I believe that this situation is a relief of the rural women in various places and it is definitely not only in a corner of Dongting West Mountain!</p>
<h3>Holding Brooms to Sweep Away Bad Habits</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>Sewing Women</h3>
<p>— Qi Feng</p>
<p>One of the Female Professions on the Streets</p>
<p>Although sewing women are a lowly occupation in the city, their widespread presence is often found among the proletariat. However, the sewing women mentioned here are completely different from the commonly known female tailors. Female tailors are hired to work in employers' homes, and their treatment includes meals in addition to their wages. Therefore, the lives of female tailors are completely opposite to those of sewing women. Sewing women not only have no meals provided but also receive pitifully low wages. They do not always have work available; sometimes, they have no work to do for an entire day. This forces them to find other ways to make a living (readers can surely understand what "finding other ways" means). As a result, they are seen as lowly women with lowly occupations.</p>
<p>Based on general observations, most of these sewing women are from Jiangbei. There are compelling reasons why they abandon their hometowns, endure hardships, and come to the bustling city to engage in this livelihood. Years of economic recession have bankrupted the rural economy. To make a living, many strong men leave the countryside and go to large cities to seek employment. However, their daily income is still insufficient to support their families. Therefore, middle-aged women have no choice but to wander into the city and join the common struggle. Due to limited knowledge and skills, besides scavenging and peddling, sewing becomes a field of their professions? It meets the need for clothing repairs for solitary, proletarian laborers living in foreign lands.</p>
<p>Of course, their lives are undoubtedly very hard. Every day, they come out of the slums and wander the streets, going door to door seeking employment. They scrape together their living expenses from this piecemeal labor. Undoubtedly, they can barely survive the unbearable hunger, and their suffering is imaginable.</p>
<p>In short, they are ten thousand times better than those social parasites who are incapable of production! We should sympathize with and praise them!</p>
<p>Special Feature of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>An Interview with Ms. Bao Yahui</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>One evening in late autumn, the reporter mingled with the audience exiting the Guotai Theater, feeling a bit dizzy. Suddenly, a thought crossed my mind: wasn't the residence of the female painter Bao Yahui just on Zuo Shan? Why not visit her along the way? Once the idea was decided, I set off for my destination with light steps. After finding the gate, I pressed the doorbell. A man resembling a doorman led me into the reception room to sit down.</p>
<p>After a while, Ms. Bao pushed the door open and came in, accompanied by a slender young man in a student uniform. After introductions, I learned that he was her nephew, Pan Guan Jun, a budding calligrapher who had recently been writing in the style of Han and Wei, known throughout the north and south. I had long heard of him and unexpectedly met him by chance. After some pleasantries, we sat around the round table and began to talk.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Xulun at home? I was hoping to talk to you both about household economics today, as Mr. Pan is an accountant and likely has clear insights on this issue to provide a reference for families large and small."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! He has a banquet tonight and has already left. Talking about household economics is indeed important, but unfortunately, I have no interest in it. Instead of making presumptuous remarks, would you mind if we chose another topic?"</p>
<p>"Then please, Ms., share your opinions."</p>
<p>She smiled, appearing very modest: "I can't think of anything to say for the moment. All I know is about painting."</p>
<p>"That's also good. Ms. is a painter, so please tell us about your successful journey in learning to paint."</p>
<p>"I can say that I have an interest in painting, but I can't speak of talent or skill, let alone success. However, my mother had considerable success in painting, and I was influenced by her from a young age, gradually developing an interest. I remember when I was receiving secondary education in my hometown, the school had several hours of drawing lessons each week. At that time, my enthusiasm was very high, and I was very bold, drawing whatever I saw and starting to copy landscapes. Once, at a performance exhibition, they selected my large-scale copy of Wang Lutai's 'Danlou Chunxiao,' hanging it in the center? It attracted the attention of viewers, and the county magistrate and school inspector came to visit. When they learned it was my work, they specially praised me, deeming me promising. My small heart was truly delighted, and I became even more motivated. However, there was a lack of teachers and friends to guide and learn from in the inland. After coming to Shanghai, I sought guidance from Mr. Lu Tieshi for many years and traveled to famous mountains and rivers, admiring many works by famous artists. My experience has broadened somewhat, but limited by my innate talent, I cannot make significant progress."</p>
<p>"A painter needs to be close to mountains and rivers, and the more experience they have, the grander their style. Have you been to Guilin, Yandang, Huangshan, etc.?"</p>
<p>"I'm very ashamed! I've always wanted to go to Guilin but haven't had the chance yet. I've been to Mount Tai, the Great Wall, Mount Chong, West and East Tianmu, and Yandang, but unfortunately, I encountered heavy rain and hid in the temple for two days without going out. I haven't even seen the Dalongqiu in Yandang, which I've always longed for, which is truly regrettable! People say that Huangshan is really wonderful, but the mountain is too steep, and my waist and legs are not strong enough, so I dare not dream of it. Landscape painting has a type of wrinkle technique, called 'Pi Ma wrinkles' and 'Axe Cut wrinkles.' I didn't understand it at first, but after seeing many Huangshan films and observing the stone patterns of the mountains, I realized that they were indeed the same as the painting methods."</p>
<p>At this point, the young painter spoke up: "Honestly speaking, the strangeness of the pines and rocks of Huangshan is truly captivating. I don't know about Yunnan and Guizhou, but as for the famous mountains of the Central Plains, this is certainly the best. I heard that Mount Hua is also like this, but I haven't been there. However, Huangshan also has considerable shortcomings, namely the lack of waterfalls. Jiulong Waterfall is the only one, but compared to the Dalongqiu of Yandang, it is a small witch compared to a great one."</p>
<p>The reporter took a sip of tea and glanced at a landscape painting of Huangshigu hanging on the right wall, which triggered the conversation: "I've heard people say that Chinese painting flourished in the Qing Dynasty, with numerous schools and factions. Among the many painters, who would you consider the representative of Qing painting?"</p>
<p>Ms. Bao hesitated slightly before saying: "That's hard to say. Generally speaking, it is naturally the Four Wangs (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Yuanqi, Wang Lutai). Among the Four Wangs, Wang Yuanqi has the deepest attainment. We know that Chinese landscape painting is divided into Northern and Southern Schools. The Southern School is independent and innovative, while the Northern School was founded by Li Sixun. Although they do not use topography as a boundary, they are vastly different. Since Tang Yin of the Ming Dynasty combined the Northern style with the Southern style, everyone thought that the North and South would converge. In fact, this accomplishment was undoubtedly achieved by Wang Yuanqi alone. As for Wang Shimin and Wang Jian, they deliberately imitated Dong Qichang. Dong Qichang is naturally an outstanding figure of the Southern School, and the two lived at the same time, so they were very close to Dong Qichang. Wang Lutai's brushwork is skilled but not ingratiating, vivid but not rough, deeply capturing the essence of Huang Gongwang, which is not easy to achieve."</p>
<p>At this time, Pan Jun nodded frequently, so I asked: "Mr. Pan, what do you think of your aunt's high opinion?"</p>
<p>He took a big puff of his cigarette, and a puff of smoke rolled out with a smile: "Absolutely! Absolutely! However, I think Wu Yushan (Wu Li) surpassed both the North and the South with his majestic style. Although his fame at the time was not as great as Wang Yuanqi's and others, there were other reasons for this. Perhaps Wu Yushan had a bit of a celebrity air, arrogant by nature, unwilling to curry favor with his masters, so even in his old age, he was still wandering the world, with no intention of seeking fame. Not to mention anything else, we see very few of his paintings in traditional copies. In terms of his works, he can also be considered a representative master."</p>
<p>The conversation grew longer and longer, and the enthusiasm grew stronger and stronger. I quickly closed the conversation, shook hands, and said goodbye.</p>
<h3>Ms. Yahui</h3>
<h3>Dinner Party</h3>
<p>— Xue Ying</p>
<p>I once attended a dinner party, and the impression it left on us has not faded to this day, perhaps never will! On a Sunday in early autumn, I received an invitation from a classmate I had grown up with since childhood, inviting me to a dinner party at the newly opened Xinlu Grand Hotel. Dinner parties are very ordinary, but that day, because I hadn't been in touch with this classmate for a long time, I couldn't help but feel a little surprised. I first called the Daxin Bank, intending only to ask for the telephone number of their president, Li, but the operator unexpectedly told me that President Li was currently at the bank, so I spoke directly with Li Ruifu. I couldn't help but ask him why he was still at the bank on Sunday. He said he was very busy. I said that since he was so busy, why did he still want to invite guests? He said it wasn't an invitation, just a chat with a few old friends. I asked who else was coming. He said that Zhao Shu and his wife would probably be there. After saying that, he hung up the phone. I thought that this President Li was too presumptuous. When someone called him, he didn't even say, "Please be sure to come tonight." But I didn't want to argue with him, and I had a special reason for wanting to see Zhao Shu's wife. That evening, I arrived at the new restaurant on time. I asked, but the host hadn't arrived yet, but the waiter said that President Li had booked a room and paid ten dollars in advance, and said that if he didn't come, he would ask the guest to dine alone. At that time, I was really hungry, so I sat alone in that empty room, facing the three empty chairs, and ate a fine dinner.</p>
<p>After returning home, I felt like I had a huge, unresolved puzzle in my heart. I couldn't figure out what Li Ruifu was up to. The next morning, I unexpectedly saw a shocking piece of bad news in the local news of various newspapers, titled "President Li Ruifu of Daxin Bank Drove into the River," roughly saying that around 7 o'clock last night, Li Ruifu was driving his own car, traveling near a certain pier in Yangshupu, when he accidentally crashed into the Huangpu River. Zhao Shu and his wife, the head of the remittance department of Daxin Bank, were also in the car, and all three drowned. Their bodies had not yet been recovered. At first, I was naturally very sad, but later, after thinking carefully, I felt very surprised because Li Ruifu and Zhao Shu's homes were clearly near Haig Road in West Shanghai, and the Daxin Bank was also located on Hankou Road. They had no need to go to Yangshupu at all, and around 7 o'clock was the time of the dinner party that Li Ruifu had arranged. Why didn't he come to the Xinlu Grand Hotel on Xizang Road and instead went to Yangshupu? It was too strange!</p>
<p>At noon that day, a registered letter from Li Ruifu was suddenly delivered to my house. How could a dead person still send a letter? I rushed to look at the postmark, and it turned out it was sent yesterday. I hurriedly opened it and saw that it was indeed his suicide note. He said that he invited me to dinner, but he didn't necessarily want me to go, as long as I knew that he had done this. So he didn't strongly invite me on the phone, and he was writing this letter to me when I called him. He told me that he deeply regretted being frivolous in school and having a love affair with Zou Xian ＋ Zhao Shu's wife — and having a physical relationship. But he was already married and couldn't find a way, so he tried his best to introduce her to Zhao Shu, and after their marriage, he spared no effort to recommend Zhao Shu to Daxin Bank, where he served as the head of the remittance department. Unexpectedly, Zhao Shu gradually learned about the relationship between his wife and Li Ruifu, and his attitude became very overbearing. Within three years, he had embezzled several times, and Li Ruifu was forced to make up for it. Recently, he speculated unsuccessfully and lost more than 200,000 yuan at once. Li Ruifu was worried about being sued by the board of directors on the one hand, and Zhao Shu was forcing him to declare bankruptcy and compensate for him on the other. He felt that he had been very unfair to his wife and children in the past, so he decided to preserve his family property and was willing to take Zhao Shu and his wife with him to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p>Now, two years have passed, and I have followed his instructions and tried my best to take care of his family, but his wife and children still don't know that he committed suicide!</p>

<p>A Millennia-Old Scholarly Puzzle</p>
<h3>The Difficult Problem of Tuberculosis Treatment Has Opened Up a Supreme New Path</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Scott M.D., Translated by Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>In the past, using chemical drugs to kill lung bacteria was an unfounded fantasy! Today, the organ therapy adopted by all nations is indeed based on reason and effectiveness!</p>
<p>Modern medicine has long proclaimed the slogan of "no medicine can be administered" for tuberculosis. This is not surprising, because of the countless so-called new medicines invented to this day. Ask about the results. Which one has not disappointed patients?</p>
<p>Why are drug treatments for tuberculosis ineffective? There are various reasons for this problem. Because the pathogen of tuberculosis is the tubercle bacillus, and the affected area is located deep in the lungs. Tubercle bacilli have extremely strong resistance. Whether taken internally or injected, drugs cannot directly reach the lungs to destroy them.</p>
<p>Using drug therapy for tuberculosis often carries risks. The reason is that some chemical drugs, although capable of killing tubercle bacilli in test tubes, are extremely potent and toxic. Moreover, humans are living organisms, not made of iron and stone. If strong drugs that can kill tubercle bacilli are applied to the human body, there is naturally a risk of poisoning. Therefore, in medicine, it can be said that no drugs have been found that can directly kill tubercle bacilli in the body without harming the human body.</p>
<p>In 1932, the International Tuberculosis Conference was held in Vienna, Austria. Famous lung disease experts from various countries attended and unanimously agreed that "organ therapy for tuberculosis" is a well-founded and most reasonable therapy. Organ therapy was invented by German Berthold A.A. Berthald and British Starlinl. There is now a "Lung Vital" Phlth Weal, which is made from endocrine hormones extracted from the lung and spleen tissues of healthy mammals. Using "Lung Vital" Phith Weal to treat tuberculosis (i.e., tuberculosis) has great and miraculous natural effects. All those who have practiced this method have exclaimed in amazement. Since the invention of "Lung Vital" Phith Weal, the difficult problem of treating lung disease for thousands of years has opened up a supreme new path. Completely and fundamentally solved. Even today, the number of people who have benefited from it is countless.</p>
<p>The effect of the organ preparation "Lung Vital" Phith Weal in treating tuberculosis can revive the function of atrophied lungs (i.e., diseased lungs). At the same time, it encourages the vitality of lung cells, exerts their natural defense function, strengthens their resistance, conquers tubercle bacilli, and proliferates connective tissue to fill in the defects of lesions. Moreover, a dike is built around the diseased area from this connective tissue (shaped like a defense line in war) to surround the evil tubercle bacilli, prohibiting their activity, and making white blood cells attack them, causing them to disappear and reduce. The affected area also forms sclerosis, forms scars, and heals. This therapy enables the patient's body to exert its natural defense function and surrounds the tuberculous lesions to wait for the enemy to destroy itself. Therefore, "Lung Vital" is harmless to the human body and has an incredible effect on lung disease.</p>
<p>Medical Experiment</p>
<h3>A Discussion on the Radical Cure of Asthma</h3>
<p>— Written by British BAUSZKY, Translated by Lu Zhicheng</p>
<p>Bronchial asthma refers to the narrowing of the bronchi, causing wheezing and difficulty breathing that comes and goes. The onset of this disease usually begins with easy susceptibility to colds, frequent bronchitis, or difficulty breathing. Over time, it develops into a fixed type of asthma. If patients are left untreated or treated improperly, it becomes a lifelong illness, with no hope of health. It often complicates with pulmonary tuberculosis or emphysema, resulting in an inability to live out their natural lifespan.</p>
<p>There has never been a perfect medicine for the treatment of asthma. Therefore, it is stubborn and difficult to cure. Usually, when asthma attacks, morphine and other anesthetics are injected or taken internally to temporarily relieve the suffering. However, it is ineffective for attacks that last longer. This is because anesthetics are only effective for a short time. Once the drug wears off, it returns to its original state. And if it is used every time it occurs, it can easily lead to addiction. Therefore, it should not be used frequently. It is necessary to carefully select good medicines to seek a safe and radical cure.</p>
<p>Here, Dr. Hemboldt, a German medical doctor, has adopted the effective components extracted from the organs of mammals based on new theories and combined with his usual clinical experience, and produced an effective oral medicine for asthma, "Xiaoliping" Holipin. The medicine does not contain any anesthetics. Its action is entirely natural and has absolutely no harm to the human body. It has been proven by global physician experiments that taking it during an asthma attack will lead to recovery in about a few minutes. Moreover, this disease often occurs at night, and it is often inconvenient to invite a doctor. Therefore, the oral therapy of "Xiaoliping" Holipin is greatly beneficial to patients and can avoid the pain of injection. According to the treatment reports of experts from various countries, "Xiaoliping" is not only effective for emergency relief of asthma but also has the possibility of radically curing asthma. If patients take it continuously for two or three months during the remission period, the results can often radically cure it and prevent it from recurring. Scholars around the world have long established a fixed comment on this medicine. Experimental reports have been scattered in magazines and newspapers in various countries and need not be repeated.</p>

<p>Talking About Menstruation</p>
<h3>Women's Melancholy! How to Make Menstruation Smooth, Youthful, and Beautiful?</h3>
<p>— Female Physician Bai Xiuzhen</p>
<p>The most common of women's diseases are menstrual disorders, menstrual pain, and amenorrhea. Those who suffer from this disease are not limited to the irregularity of menstruation alone but must also have a sallow complexion, languid spirit, back pain, lack of sleep, frequent leucorrhea, often lacking vitality, hindering fertility, and even falling into a state of dry blood and tuberculosis. It is a truly tragic disease. The irregularity of menstruation is not caused by blood stasis and stagnation but is a manifestation of an obstacle in the female reproductive function. Once this function is impaired, all endocrine glands in the body are also impaired simultaneously. As a result, the tissues of the whole body decline, the blood gradually becomes withered, and the appearance changes drastically, becoming dull and haggard, leaving no trace of natural health and beauty, and the disease is limited to distress.</p>
<p>According to the author's clinical experience, there is now a medicine called "Meinuoduo" Monorrin, which was invented based on the needs of female pathology. If my female compatriots suffering from menstrual disorders can take it according to the method, they can obtain smooth menstruation, eliminate all diseases, and restore health. If healthy young girls take it regularly, their bodies can become healthier and their appearance more plump. If women take it regularly, they can strengthen their bodies and maintain their youth. It is truly a good medicine for women's health care, disease prevention, blood tonification, and menstruation regulation.</p>

<h3>Lust is the First Barrier for Young People</h3>
<p>— Physician Fang Shitong</p>
<p>Confucius said: "When young people's blood and energy are not yet stable, they must be warned against lust." When the spring feelings of men and women are aroused, sexual desire is excited, which can most affect the body and spirit. Sociologists in Germany call it: "The most dangerous period of life." Those who are excessively licentious will deplete their essence, damage their kidneys, and sever their true source, leading to weakness and disease. Most cases of tuberculosis in young people are caused by lust.</p>
<p>It is often seen that young men, still in their youth, have their feelings awakened, either secretly reading erotic books and novels or engaging in frivolous and obscene conversations, thereby arousing lustful fire. They often secretly vent their precious essence through masturbation or frolic in brothels, indulging in unrestrained promiscuity, or they may have nocturnal emissions and wet dreams, all of which are sufficient to consume their energy and damage their vitality. As a result, they gradually become physically weak, their appetite decreases, their waist aches, their legs become weak, they experience dizziness, blurred vision, depression, headaches, forgetfulness, insomnia, and various symptoms of neurasthenia appear. Parents are alarmed and worried, not knowing what to do, or thinking that it is congenital deficiency, or that it is caused by wind and cold, or that tonification is improper. In fact, it is all a self-made disaster.</p>
<p>Ancient sages have said: "Lust is the first barrier for young people." If this barrier cannot be overcome, no matter how high their talent and learning, they cannot succeed. Everything is based on the body, and the body is based on essence. Therefore, if the essence is not exhausted, the ears and eyes will be clear, and the body and mind will be healthy, like oil nourishing a lamp. If the oil is not exhausted, the lamp will not go out. If the fire of lust burns, the spirit will easily be exhausted, leading to kidney deficiency and physical weakness, eventually developing into consumption and dying an unnatural death. How can this not be feared?</p>
<p>The sea of desire is boundless; turning back is the shore. This is what young people should reflect on.</p>
<h3>Physical Hygiene</h3>
<p>Sexual desire is extremely easy to be aroused during the spring arousal period. It is also easy to make mistakes due to overwhelming enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is advisable to avoid stimulating excitement. It is essential to avoid alcohol, as alcohol can cause sexual desire. Young people must avoid it completely.</p>
<p>Usually, pay attention to cultivating the mind and body, eliminating all bad habits, and practicing proper hygiene. Often take walks in the wild and engage in beneficial exercises, avoiding overwork of the mind and body. If the body is weak, eat more nutritious foods.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Stoll, a great hygienist, people who have the bad habit of masturbation and find it difficult to quit are all congenital neurotics. Because they have weak willpower, they cannot control this impulsive behavior. Therefore, it is advisable to use the nerve tonic "Memory Neurotic" to nourish their brainpower, strengthen their body and mind, and strengthen their willpower. It can control the bad habit of overwhelming enthusiasm. This medicine has been used to test many people, and all have achieved satisfactory results and exhibit a vigorous spirit.</p>
<h3>Strengthening the Brain and Body</h3>
<p>Neurasthenia is a disease that inevitably occurs in those who masturbate and engage in excessive sexual activity. For example, heaviness, headache, dizziness, forgetfulness, insomnia, night sweats, palpitations, memory loss, general fatigue, back pain, lack of perseverance, pale skin, emaciated body, mental depression, nocturnal emissions, and wet dreams are all symptoms of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>The treatment for this disease is the nerve tonic "Mimeier Brain Tonic" Memory Neurotic, which is most effective. After use, it can make the brain healthy, the body strong, and the energy sufficient. It is truly a good product among tonics. However, cultivation and hygiene must still be emphasized at the same time.</p>
<h3>Saving Old Age</h3>
<p>Early marriage, indulging in lust, and self-inflicted injury can all consume the original yang. To save various symptoms of weakness, you should use the "Huair Tong", a powerful essence-enhancing and kidney-tonifying agent. It has a remarkable effect and no drawbacks. Because this product is made from the testicles of strong animals, after patients take it, it can promote the physiological function of the reproductive organs, enhance the function of producing semen, restore the vitality of the whole body, and replenish the original qi. If those who share early use are used by the elderly, they can regain the vigor of youth and have a renewed sense of vitality. Nowadays, doctors in various countries are recommending "Huair Tong" WellTonic as the world's only natural tonic. Compared with the efficacy of ordinary Si Bao Ming and other similar preparations on the market, it is many times greater. Its value can be known.</p>
<h3>How Can a Backward Youth Open Up a Bright Path?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanzhen</p>
<p>The longing of young people in their student days for clear thinking methods and strong memory techniques is like the hunger of famine victims seeking food. This is the same psychology as old people seeking methods for immortality and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>During youth, physical sexual anxieties easily arise due to the activity of internal secretions from the reproductive organs. Mentally, because the desire for knowledge is high, they are fond of reading and thus anxieties are even greater. As for the state of anxiety during exams, that is even more intense! Therefore, about seven or eight out of ten young students today feel the sorrow of neurasthenia.</p>
<p>Neurasthenia—is an evil demon destroying youthful life in the darkness! This disease can transform a promising youth into a pathetic, useless wreck. The happiness of life is completely lost, which is such a terrible disease.</p>
<p>The brain is the root of the nervous system. The nerve fibers emanating from the brain, like branches of a tree, spread to all tissues and organs of the body. All our actions must be commanded by the brain—transmitted by the nerves—to operate the overall life phenomenon for survival. Therefore, Gall said: "Human instincts, emotions, thoughts, talents, desires, and other moral, intellectual, and various mental phenomena all originate in the brain." From this perspective, the brain is the master of the human body—in other words, the brain is our lifeline. Therefore, if we want to save the weakening of the nerves, we must replenish the nutrition of the brain!</p>
<p>According to this, if you want to cultivate a healthy brain and get rid of neurasthenia that destroys vitality, the only way is to regularly take Memory Neurotic "Mimeier Brain Tonic". It can make the brain healthy, the nerves strong, and the energy abundant. Only in this way can you achieve the effects of clear thinking, agile thoughts, and strong memory. Apart from this kind of therapeutic method, no matter what tonic you take, it is a waste of effort and of no benefit—now doctors from various countries have proven that "Mimeier Brain Tonic" has the authority to save weakness—and cultivate brain power. After investigating reports from major European and American hospital clinics, it is confirmed that tens of millions of backward young people have regained their health and reached a state of success after taking this medicine. Therefore, I translated it for my weak and backward young compatriots in China, to open up a dark life and seek a fulfilling path!</p>

<h3>Grand Exercise of the 29th Army</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Having just witnessed the "unprecedented" grand military exercise of our "friendly nation" in the Tianjin-Beijing area, the residents of the Tianjin-Beijing area only heard the gunshots of the "friendly nation" and saw the flags of the rising sun flying inside and outside the "City of Culture". But now, fortunately, we can still hear the gunshots of our own country and see the galloping of thousands of Chinese soldiers. It's ridiculous to say, but hearing the gunshots of our own country can't help but be slightly self-deprecating. This is quite similar to the actions of Ah Q, but at this time and place, being able to do some Ah Q-style self-consolation is already very fortunate.</p>
<p>General Song Zheyuan recently said to someone: "I will never be a slave of a fallen country, nor will I be Wu Sangui or Hong Chengchou, but I will not be Wen Tianxiang or Shi Kefa, but I will be Guo Ziyi." Guo Ziyi single-handedly repelled the Uyghurs and stabilized the Tang Dynasty, while Wen Tianxiang and Shi Kefa, although their names will be immortalized, the Song and Ming dynasties ultimately fell. Even if there are loyal ministers who die for their country after the country has fallen, it is ultimately useless. On this point, General Song's willingness to be Guo Ziyi rather than Wen or Shi is worthy of approval.</p>
<p>In North China, under a cloud of dark and stagnant air, it is difficult for General Song to maintain the status quo while also being unable to make further progress. We certainly didn't expect this grand military exercise of the 29th Army. Of course, this probably doesn't contain any hostile meaning for the "friendly nation." But after all, it is our land, and the people can only see foreign soldiers. Now that the Chinese soldiers that the people support with their money are also appearing, we can't help but have some indescribable feelings about this exercise.</p>
<p>From the grand military exercise of the 29th Army, we naturally think of the more than two million troops across the country. It would be best if they could all be transferred to the front lines of national defense and come to a grand exercise. People are conducting exercises on our land, and clearly using Beijing as the hypothetical attack point. Then, if we conduct a grand exercise across the country, it would be difficult for the friendly nation to say that this is a hostile act. The posture of our army towards the outside world, the radiance of the national emblem, and the people's desire to see it are too enthusiastic. Armed comrades, we warmly welcome your grand military exercise.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this leads us to think of the recent enthusiastic purchase of planes by all sectors to celebrate Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. This matter can be discussed from many aspects, but one point cannot be ignored, which is that the enthusiasm of the people in purchasing and donating aircraft shows the need for these aircraft, which can show off military strength on the battlefield. The planes bought with the hard-earned money of millions of people, they only hope that they will still be used to protect millions of people. Of course, it is definitely not just for show or to join in the fun. How the people hope that this large number of planes can be used to defend the country is the sincere desire hidden in the people's hearts.</p>
<p>The people's support and sponsorship for the country and the government has reached its peak. How will those who are responsible for defending the country and the nation repay this immeasurable enthusiasm of millions of people with practical actions?</p>
<h3>Water Rates to Increase</h3>
<p>— Majia</p>
<p>According to the Dalu News, the Public Concession's Bureau of Public Works is currently consulting with the Shanghai Waterworks Company on the company's proposal to revise the current water rate regulations. According to the announcement made by Chairman Li Deli at the company's annual meeting of shareholders in March of this year: According to the annual report, the company's profits are insufficient to pay "dividends" without using "accumulated funds," so the move to increase water rates is inevitable. Recently, because it "had to" do so, it submitted this proposal to the Bureau of Public Works. If it is negotiated, the date of implementation has not yet been announced. However, it is expected that it will be implemented from "the first day of next month" (i.e., December 1st) or January 1st of next year.</p>
<p>If this news is spread to the ears of every Shanghai resident, I believe that the panic will definitely be more severe than when telephone rates were increased. We common people can choose not to install telephones, it doesn't matter! Even if they are installed, unless it is a store or business that is absolutely necessary, the number of households that install telephones is still a small minority of the 800,000 residents of Shanghai. However, tap water is essential</p>

<p>Ling Shu Su Wen</p>
<p>— Answered by Doctor Liu Xinbai</p>
<p>Being Too Fat</p>
<p>No. 88, Student Huai Shen of Daxia University asked: (1) My body is too fat; although I often do indoor exercises, I still don't see any weight loss? (2) How to practice contraception? (3) I get headaches when reading for too long, my memory is poor, is it effective to take Ai Luo Brain Tonic? (4) Does eating cod liver oil make people fatter?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) A person's body fat or thinness is determined by the amount of fat stored in the body, so if you plan to lose weight, you must remove the fat in the body. Reducing fat is called lipolysis. And almost everything a person eats in a day has the potential to turn into fat. So, to lose weight, you can only reduce food and increase exercise. The former can reduce the production of fat, and the latter can increase the consumption of fat. In nutrition, the production and sales of fat are calculated in "Caville" units, which is the same as calculating heat in physics. Although the amount of "calories" used by each person to maintain nutrition varies, it is generally between 5,000 and 7,000. So, after calculating the calories input into the body every day, if you reduce it below the amount of consumption, the fat in the body will gradually decrease, which means that the person will slowly lose weight. On this point, Mr. Shen can buy a book with a table of food calorie estimates, and calculate his diet according to this book. (2) Not within the scope of the answer, sorry I cannot answer. (3) For neurasthenia, please inject "Blusen". (4) Yes. It can make people fat.</p>
<p>Headaches from Overwork</p>
<p>No. 89, Zhou Guohua, employee of the Shanghai Yarn Factory's Industrial and Commercial Division, No. 1970, Guangxin Road, Yangshupu, asked: My body is inherently weak, and I get headaches immediately after a little labor or staying up late. The location of the pain varies. What medicine can cure it?</p>
<p>Answer: Take "Tpmbelin", two tablets each time, but this is close to symptomatic treatment. Your headache is caused by physical and mental overwork, so it is advisable to inject "Hormspermin".</p>
<p>Painful Periods and Infertility</p>
<p>No. 90, Chen Min asked, No. 16, Furi Village, Avenyue Road. I have back pain, abdominal pain, leg pain, mental fatigue, sleepiness, irritability, and decreased appetite during menstruation. There is still a red tide after intercourse the day after menstruation. I am infertile, and I usually have leucorrhea. Semen gradually flows out after intercourse. Please tell me (1) what is the disease causing menstrual pain, (2) what medicine can cure it? (3) Can the red tide after intercourse after menstruation become a lifelong disease? (4) How can I have children? (5) What medicine can cure leucorrhea? (6) Is the outflow of semen after intercourse the reason why I cannot conceive?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) This is called "dysmenorrhea." (2) One day before the onset of menstruation, three times a day, take one spoonful of "Tancnol" and two tablets of "Tonbelin" at the same time, and continue to take it until after menstruation. Menstrual pain can completely disappear. (3) This is a common phenomenon and is not a disease. Taking the previous medicine can also cure it. However, intercourse on the day after menstruation is not suitable. It is best to delay it for one or two days. (4) There are many reasons for infertility. Without diagnosing the cause, a definite conclusion cannot be drawn. Infertility cannot be entirely blamed on the wife, the husband is also responsible. (5) Take "Slinocalcin". (6) Only a small portion of healthy intercourse semen remains in the vagina, and most of it is discharged; therefore, this phenomenon of yours is a physiological phenomenon, not a pathological phenomenon, and is not the cause of infertility.</p>
<p>Nephritis and Marriage</p>
<p>No. 91, Li Xiushi, No. 26, Yulin Lane, Guling Road, asked: I am 20 years old this year, a single male. I suffered from acute nephritis nine years ago, but I left the hospital before I was completely cured. To this day, every urine test contains trace amounts of protein, and sometimes a small amount of red blood cells. If I drink a lot of boiled water frequently in cold weather, I can urinate three or four times within an hour, each time with as much as four or five hundred cubic centimeters. Now my body is weak, and I occasionally have "uric acid leg pain" (?). Although my actions are like a normal person, I must clearly suffer from chronic nephritis. Ask (1) can I get married? (2) What are the disadvantages after marriage?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes. (2) No harm. But since you know you have this disease, why not cure it as soon as possible?</p>
<p>Bacteria in Urine</p>
<p>No. 92, Zhou Jian, No. 39, Wu Family Lane, Houjia Road, City, asked. . I had gonorrhea before, and it has been cured now. Recently, I went to the Health Bureau to test my urine and found that I had chain bacteria (editor's note: probably streptococcus), but no diplococcus was found. Therefore, please answer the following questions: (1) What medicine can be used to treat the chain bacteria myself, please introduce it! (2) Is the white juice sealing my mouth every morning prostate leakage, what medicine can cure it? (3) Can I have sex if I have chain bacteria?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) The discovery of streptococci in the urine suggests the possibility of cystitis. It is advisable to ask a doctor for diagnosis and then take "Citropin" and "Uvarsol". (2) This is not a symptom of prostatitis, but a symptom of chronic gonorrhea. Diplococci are very rare in the urine of chronic gonorrhea, and are often not found after a hundred tests. In this case, 25 million units of "Polygon Gonococcus Vaccine" should be injected first, and then the urine should be re-examined. (3) No.</p>
<p>Is it Syphilis</p>
<p>No. 93, Zhang Kanran asked: I occasionally went to brothels and contracted gonorrhea. It has been more than two months now, and I have generally recovered, but a month ago, an ulcer appeared in the foreskin of my penis. At first, I thought it was due to gonorrhea, so I didn't pay attention to it. Later, there were two hard lumps in the crooks of my legs, so I suspected it was inguinal lymphadenopathy, but it didn't hurt, and it wasn't big or small. Now my joints are sore and my throat hurts. (1) I don't know if it is syphilis? (2) Can gonorrhea turn into syphilis? (3) How can I know for sure? (4) How to treat it by injecting 606 or other injections.</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes. (2) It is not that gonorrhea turns into syphilis, it is that the two diseases are contracted at the same time, but gonorrhea has a short incubation period, so it occurs first. Syphilis has a long incubation period, so it only becomes a disease after a month. (3) Blood test. (4) Inject 606 and "Carbisin". The former is one injection per week, and the latter is one injection every three days.</p>
<p>Wet and Rotten Feet</p>
<p>No. 94, Zheng Dinghan, No. 45, Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, French Concession, asked: My enemy has had rotten feet since he was ten years old, and now he is twenty years old. In these ten years, although he has undergone ten medical treatments, they have not been effective. At first, it was a small part of the foot, because the strange sores had to be scratched, which led to ulcers. Now both feet are festering and unbearable, with layers of scars and flowing blood and pus. I think this is a venereal disease inherited from my parents, right? Because I have never been to brothels: (1) Is it venereal disease? (2) Do my parents need to go to the hospital for a blood test? (3) What kind of injection should I get? (4) What medicine should I take internally and apply externally?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Will I know after a blood test? (2) No need. (3) Those who test positive for blood should inject "Aaphenamin", and those who test negative should inject "Jukulol". (4) No internal medicine is needed, apply "Pixrol Ointment" externally.</p>
<p>Poor Memory</p>
<p>No. 95, Wang Yixin asked: I am still in middle school, and unfortunately I was tempted by others to masturbate. Later, I saw the teacher's statement about the harm of masturbation, and I immediately quit. But after that, my sexual desire was very high. When I saw a woman, I immediately had erotic fantasies. My heart beats, my memory is poor, I have fantasies, I am suspicious, I am irritable, and I don't know what I am reading when I read books. It is difficult to put my mind on books. Nocturnal emission is also common. Recently, I have learned that I have premature ejaculation. I am very worried that if this disease is not cured, won't my parents' expectations and my own future be ruined? Please save me! (1) Is it sexual neurasthenia? (2) How to treat nocturnal emission? (3) Can premature ejaculation prevent me from getting married? (4) How to cure sexual neurasthenia? (5) Can premature ejaculation be cured, how to treat it?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes. (2) Take "Bromagsin". (3) It is not absolutely impossible to get married, but it is difficult to have a happy and fulfilling family, and it constitutes grounds for divorce. (4) Inject "Blu". (5) Yes, inject "Polytonin".</p>
<p>Ejaculation Immediately After Intercourse</p>
<p>No. 96, Yang Yongkang, No. 16, Shangwen Road, Nanshi, asked: I have a weak physique, and I have become increasingly weak since I got married last autumn. I leak sperm when I see a woman, and I ejaculate immediately after intercourse. I have symptoms such as indigestion and insomnia. May I ask the teacher about these symptoms: (1) Is it caused by early marriage or weak physique? (2) What is the future development? (3) Does my wife's infertility have anything to do with me? What is the relationship? (4) How to treat it? Take medicine or see a doctor? (5) What medicine is the most effective and which doctor is the best? Please introduce them. (6) How to pay attention to health preservation?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Early marriage, excessive sexual activity, and masturbation before marriage can all cause this. (2) If you do not pay attention to treatment, you will never have a day to regain happiness. (3) It is related, but it is not necessarily entirely from this. To get a detailed diagnosis, both parties must be diagnosed. (4) See (5) (6). (5) Take "Bromagsin" and inject "Polytonin". It will definitely be more effective to seek medical treatment and then determine the treatment. However, due to the regulations of the Health Department, I cannot introduce which doctor is the "best". (6) Abstain from sex for at least three months. Take cold water baths and take tonics: "Star Brand Refined Cod Liver Oil" and "Livemin".</p>
<p>Coughing and Lung Disease</p>
<p>No. 97, Huang Zhiling asked: I am thirty years old, and I have suffered from coughing and thick phlegm since I was a child, but my body is still good. Since March of this year, I have been getting thinner every day, and my phlegm contains blood streaks. My chest aches faintly when I cough. Recently, it has been even worse, with night sweats and fever in the afternoon. I am afraid it is lung disease, so I dare to write a letter to ask the teacher: (1) Is it lung disease? (2) Is it dangerous if I don't treat it? (3) What medicine should I take and what medicine should I inject? (4) How to treat night sweats and how to treat fever? (5) What medicine can stop coughing? (6) I plan to come and ask the teacher for a diagnosis. What are the teacher's consultation hours?</p>
<p>Answer: (1) Yes. (2) You should be treated quickly. (3) Take "Star Brand Refined Cod Liver Oil" and "Sinocholin". (4) Take LupulinCamphormonobromide for night sweats and "Neopyretin" for fever. (5) "Kresocal". (6) 9-12 am, 3-5 pm. Rest on Sunday afternoons.</p>
<p>one of the daily necessities that every Shanghai resident needs at all times. Now that the price is going to increase, it is invisibly adding to the burden on the shoulders of us common people, which is already heavy. Most of the lane houses in Shanghai can be said to be inhabited by the "very poor". A single building, up and down, with a loft added, and the patio and balcony are also blocked off to form rooms, and it is very common and universal for six or seven families to live in it. We can also find very trivial quarrels or even small fights from this single building up and down every day, expressed between the so-called "second landlord" and the "third tenant". And the cause of the quarrel or even the small fight is mostly because the "third tenant" uses "too many" electric lights, or "wastes" "too much tap water." Perhaps these trivial disputes will make the shareholders of the electric light company or the tap water company laugh their heads off? However, in the eyes of us very poor people, it is a serious matter and not a joke at all!</p>
<p>Now, the reason why the Shanghai Waterworks Company wants to increase the price of tap water is, according to the official announcement of Mr. Li Deli, the chairman of the company, based on the annual report, the company's "profits" are not enough to pay "dividends" without using "public accumulation funds", so the move to increase water rates is really unavoidable. However, we want to say to the shareholders of the water company: Now is the time of a very fierce economic panic in the world, and it is "getting worse and worse". Of course, your profits cannot be compared to those in a thriving economy. What's more, "public accumulation funds" are still accumulated with the sweat and blood of us very poor people! In order not to pay your "dividends", you ignore the difficulty of making a living for us common people, so the move to increase water rates is really a bit too "selfish" in common sense. We dare not agree with your increase in water rates at all!</p>
<h3>Shepherd's Purse</h3>
<p>— Liao Chuxiu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren once described shepherd's purse in his "Wild Vegetables of My Hometown" as follows: "...Shepherd's purse is a wild vegetable that people in eastern Zhejiang often eat in spring. Not to mention the countryside, even in the city, as long as there are families with back gardens, they can pick and eat it at any time. Women and children, each with a pair of scissors and a "seedling basket," squat on the ground searching, which is an interesting game and work. At that time, the children sang: "Shepherd's purse and toothed grass, sister married at the back door." Later, toothed grass was brought into the city for sale by villagers, but shepherd's purse is still a kind of wild vegetable, which must be picked by oneself."</p>
<p>The people in my hometown are poorer than those in eastern Zhejiang. They search for anything that can be sold for money and sell it. Therefore, some people also carry shepherd's purse to the streets for sale.</p>
<p>Shepherd's purse is really a wild vegetable that grows everywhere. Like in my family, there is a small back garden, so there is no need to take it from elsewhere. In spring, the afternoons are really long and a little scary, so my mother would take us to the back garden to stroll around. On the one hand, she would call the little maid to "pick" shepherd's purse. Picking shepherd's purse is called "picking" in our hometown, just like in eastern Zhejiang. However, instead of scissors, we use a special triangular knife for digging grass for feeding sheep. We don't necessarily eat it after picking it. Often, it turns yellow and cannot be eaten, so we throw it away. However, my mother always asked the little maid to "pick" it every other day, completely as a pastime.</p>
<p>In spring, when the shepherd's purse is in bloom, I would run to the back garden to pick it every day. At the same time, I would sing an incomplete children's song that I had heard:</p>
<p>"Shepherd's purse flowers bloom layer by layer like a pearl tower, rapeseed flowers bloom like gold—"</p>
<p>One afternoon passed in this song.</p>
<p>Jiang Wu Niu Xiu's "Early Grass" says: "In lean years, the sweet grass comes first." Sweet grass is shepherd's purse. Liu Bowen's early spring poem: "Happy to see children reporting each other, shepherd's purse coming up by the wall." I don't know if it's true? But shepherd's purse grows very early, and it is especially delicious in early spring because it is tender. Shepherd's purse is always a new dish in New Year's cuisine.</p>
<p>Gu Lu's "Qing Jia Yin" says in "March Wild Vegetable Flowers": "Shepherd's purse flowers are commonly called wild vegetable flowers because there is a saying that on the third day of the third month, ants climb onto the stove mountain. On the third day, families put vegetable flowers on the stove to suppress insects and ants. Village children shout and sell them endlessly, or women wear them in their hair to pray for clear eyes, commonly known as 'eye-brightening flowers,' or they are fried with last year's rice cakes and eaten, saying they can brighten the eyes, called 'eye-brightening cakes.'" Su Dongpo's "Mutual Induction of Things" also says: "On the third day of the third month, collect shepherd's purse flowers and place them on lampstands, so that moths and mosquitoes will not fly over." This is naturally not true. Even the people of Wu now put shepherd's purse flowers on the stove on the third day of the third month, but it is only because they have been doing so throughout history.</p>
<p>You Rucheng's "West Lake Tour Guide" says: "On the third day of the third month, men and women all wear shepherd's purse flowers. There is a saying: "Wearing shepherd's purse in spring, peach and plum blossoms are ashamed of their beauty." Wu Manyun's "Jiangxiang Seasonal Objects" preface: "In Hangzhou customs, on the Shangsi Festival, shepherd's purse flowers are placed on the stove to drive away insects and ants. The poem says, 'A branch of spring is picked towards the stove corner.'" Hangzhou and Suzhou are not far apart, and customs have their similarities, but Hangzhou is especially fond of shepherd's purse because of the two proverbs.</p>
<p>"Qing Jia Lu" records that the people of Wu stir-fry shepherd's purse with last year's rice cakes. Mr. Zhou Zuoren also said: "But people in eastern Zhejiang don't pay much attention to these things. They just pick it to make dishes or stir-fry rice cakes." Shepherd's purse itself is very delicious, and because it is a "wild vegetable," it is always mainly vegetarian. Stir-frying with meat or chicken is also very good, but it always feels inappropriate. But in Shanghai, people probably only eat it stir-fried with meat or chicken.</p>
<p>It has been ten years since I followed my mother to watch her pick shepherd's purse. It has also been four or five years since I saw the "pearl tower" like shepherd's purse flowers. My hometown is even poorer, and people naturally eat more wild shepherd's purse. I don't know if there is as much shepherd's purse in my family's back garden in recent years as there used to be? If the saying "In lean years, the sweet grass comes first" is correct, then there must be very little. Only the two incomplete children's songs that I heard are still not forgotten:</p>
<p>"Shepherd's purse flowers bloom layer by layer like a pearl tower, rapeseed flowers bloom like gold!"</p>
<h3>Rural Life</h3>
<p>— Huang</p>
<p>The Melon Trellis in the Pond</p>
<p>I went for a leisurely stroll in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The scenery in the suburbs seems unchanged, but the smoke from the thatched huts has become faint and weak. The pond in my memory, under the quiet autumn sun, rippled with silver, and the ducks floated freely.</p>
<p>There is a melon trellis in the pond, with slender loofah vines creeping beside it. The tender yellow flowers, like their owner, open their starved mouths. Two or three malnourished loofahs hang down, with manure baskets underneath to catch them. Manure basket, you filthy thing, you are precisely the cradle of new life!</p>
<p>Bloodstains on the Roadside</p>
<p>A sharp gunshot jolted me awake from my dream. I hurriedly got out of bed and saw my younger brother's sorrowful face. He was trembling all over, speaking slowly and weakly.</p>
<p>"Brother, three people were shot dead outside the back door." The back door faces the highway. Just then, a burst of noisy voices came, mixed with the hoarse cries of several women.</p>
<p>"My son...!"</p>
<p>"You died so miserably...!"</p>
<p>I sat blankly on the edge of the bed, listening to the mournful cries, imagining the bloodstains flying and splashing on the roadside, on the green grass. I vaguely saw a young woman holding a male corpse and weeping bitterly, perhaps her father, perhaps her husband! Perhaps her younger brother.</p>
<p>A string of tears streamed down my cheeks.</p>
<p>In my hallucination, the purple blood gradually, gradually expanded, occupying all the space before my eyes, gradually closing in on me.</p>
<p>Until I came to my senses, the cries outside faded away. I hurriedly walked to the wall, stood on the table, and opened the window in the back. The sandy ground outside was stained with several patches of crimson blood. The corpses were gone, but the footprints treading on the blood stretched into the distance.</p>
<p>"Dead, may you rest in peace—someone has stepped over your bloodstains and gone ahead!"</p>
<p>Sea</p>
<p>My hometown is by the sea. I remember when I was a child, we held hands with our companions, walked on the fine sand, and wandered along the seashore. We picked up seashells and dug sand pits. When we were tired, we sat blankly, gazing at the boundless sea before us. At that time, the sea was like our mother, caressing us.</p>
<p>But now I have returned to my hometown, and I cannot see my loving mother. The sea has also lost its gentle maternal nature.</p>
<p>I walked to the seaside alone, at dusk. In the distance, the rolling mountains connected with the evening mist, and the high tide sea was like an angry tyrant. It tossed and turned, roaring.</p>
<p>Under the twilight, the sea's angry posture was magnificent, yet terrifying. It was like someone who had just broken free from chains, it rebelled.</p>
<p>The beloved hometown, the affectionate sea, only remain in my memory. What changed them? What changed them?</p>
<p>I looked at the sea, but it did not answer me, instead, it responded with roars and incessant churning.</p>

<h3>Grand Light Screens "The Battle Between Spirit and Flesh"</h3>
<p>Starring Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy</p>
<p>"The Battle Between Spirit and Flesh一To　Mory－with　Love," starring Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy, is the latest production from 20th Century Fox. This film can be divided into two aspects: One aspect is about how a tender life and feelings between husband and wife can endure and not be broken by any misunderstanding; the other is about how a man who admires a beautiful woman in his heart sees her marry another man, and that man is his best friend. Infinite pain is hidden in his heart, and in the end, he sacrifices himself to fulfill the happiness of others. Warner Baxter and Myrna Loy play a young couple, sometimes embracing and cuddling, sometimes arguing, performing vividly. Ian Hunter plays another man, deep and experienced, and his acting skills are even more amazing. The film is scheduled to be released in Grand Light starting today.</p>
